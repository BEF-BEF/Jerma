1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:14,710
Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me talking? What the fuck is going on? Well, I think I need to

2
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:27,589
refresh. It says my stream is live, but I can't see anybody typing. Let me see if this works.

3
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:44,469
I think I'm live. Yeah, okay, now I can see. That was weird. All right, so anyways,

4
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:54,020
back to Nancy Drew and the Salem mystery. But I need to pop this out. Hold on,

5
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:08,760
this one died over here. Shit. How do I get this to refresh? Refresh, please. Oh, no. Okay,

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:26,500
I'm gonna have to pop you out over here. He doesn't know. Is it off again? All right, I think.

7
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:44,489
Why can't I open the chat? I can't even open like my Twitch chat room. No. All right, I can see you

8
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:56,939
over here, but you're in a really bad spot. All right, I can see you over here. All right, here we

9
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:09,020
go. But how will they hear all about... I stream dead. I can see. I can see. Yeah, when it died,

10
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:17,930
I lost connection to like stream labs and then it killed everything. Anyways, hi. That was... I

11
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:26,300
get... whatever. I don't know what my brain was doing. I just hovered over run 60 second ad break.

12
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:39,349
Like, I was gonna run an ad? That would be horrendous. All right, here we go. My grandpa,

13
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:56,659
right? Grandpa. Oh, 120 second ad. Dude, that's the second time that the stream has just turned

14
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:04,659
off and then come right back totally normally, completely fine. I probably would rather just

15
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,039
have that than horrible issues all day. All right, where's this... where's this... what's this thing?

16
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:18,330
What is this? It's a U. All right, I need to find a U. Ceiling? Is something on the ceiling?

17
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:35,319
Can I move it? This is master difficulty. Can I leave the room? I can't even leave the room.

18
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:44,310
No, you're not getting any ads. Stream went down and I'm not coming back with an ad after that.

19
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:19,079
I don't care. I know that's like the whole point of the game, but I just... where's the U?

20
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:35,129
Am I missing something over here? Under the button? I need a U key. Here's the thing,

21
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:43,459
though. I know you guys don't know where it is either, so I don't feel bad because I know

22
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:54,939
you don't know. I swear to god, if you slide the bookcase over into the key under there,

23
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:11,110
we don't know. I know. What about this? Just spam tab, go over interactive menus.

24
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,060
It's not anything to do with like the candle thing. It has to.

25
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:47,370
The books. It's in the books. The books. It's in the books. The window.

26
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,720
I don't... going to amateur wouldn't even change anything.

27
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:04,040
Is it like all the way in the back with the spot where you cut it out and put hide a key?

28
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:13,350
Leave the room. I don't think I can... Can I leave this room? Can I leave? How long have I known my

29
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:29,540
dad? Dr. Hearst, how long have I known my dad for? Well, wait. I'm just trapped in the room.

30
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:53,500
There's nothing I can do. Is there a... find the key? They're really, they're really, they're really,

31
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,500
they're really... Wait, wait, wait. It's about hiding something. Give earth to my prayer,

32
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,180
give ear to my prayer, oh god, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy. Give ear to

33
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,379
my prayer, oh god, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy. Give ear to my prayer, oh god,

34
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,839
god. I feel like this is me streaming. Just replace the stuff between oh god with

35
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:27,129
what's happening on the video game. All right, so hide and hide not yourself from my plea for

36
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:35,269
mercy. So it's hidden in a book somewhere. It's hidden in a book. It's what we know. What's that?

37
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:50,889
What's that? What is that? Touch it. Why would I be able to zoom in on this? Move this. What is

38
00:07:50,889 --> 00:08:01,189
this thing? Click it. What about on the side of the table? Wait a minute. Other side? It's

39
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:19,060
one over here too. Hold right mouse button to rotate the item. Click on the item to interact.

40
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:25,779
What the fuck? I did it. Okay, it's one of those games. I didn't think it was one of those games,

41
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:37,350
and it is. What's in here? Yeah, get fucked. You're gonna get to my porn stash.

42
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:52,710
Let's see you in this maze. You fucking idiot. You'll never get my porn. Oh shit, that was

43
00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:00,389
wicked easy, but not this one. This one's even harder. This has pawns in there. You'll never

44
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:10,259
fucking get in there. I found it. It's here. What? Amazing. Locked behind some sort of cage though.

45
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:20,679
Yeah, yeah, yeah. AW root beer. It's a password. Oh shit, I shouldn't have shown you that. The

46
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:33,059
ghost fucking flies through. Hey, Jerma sucks. Thanks for the 15 subs. I missed the first one,

47
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:38,549
but thank you for the 10 community subs right here. Thank you. Thank you for the

48
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,509
huge amount of subs, Jerma sucks. Take it back to the shop.

49
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:52,570
No. All right, so let's get it. How do I pick it up? It's locked with a leather belt.

50
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:03,539
How do I grab it? Is it on fire? Is it burning? Is it too hot? Oh, I can leave.

51
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,029
Incoming call.

52
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,139
Can I hang up?

53
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,460
Deirdre, Deirdre, there's a tornado. I can't talk to you. My porn!

54
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:38,659
What are you?

55
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:54,710
They took the book. This is the only way out besides the door. The thief must still be

56
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:04,309
close. Let's talk about it. Quick, hurry. Imagine having to run fast and you just move forward

57
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:15,740
two feet. I'm running. That person was running like an animal. They had their hands down,

58
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:24,200
like running on all fours. Is it a werewolf? Nancy, you can't do that. That'll hurt. Quick, run.

59
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,220
Someone's pushing me from behind. No, I don't want to do it. Quick fucking sprint.

60
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:44,409
Just do it here.

61
00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:07,559
That's such an old... It was... I can't even tell you. The fucking smoke grenade.

62
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:15,220
I'm gone now. Magic acting. They did it twice. That's fucking awesome.

63
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,700
Gotta figure out which way they went. Must be a clue here.

64
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,019
I dropped my key. I dropped my address and I dropped my can that I was eating out of.

65
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,539
Scan my DNA, bitch. This canister looks to have been used as a home. You'll find me.

66
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:47,370
Oh no, I dropped my first class ticket. I'm going to Boston. By the way, I saw this movie in 3D.

67
00:12:48,090 --> 00:13:03,110
All right, first class flight, October 28th. Flight in, 0898. Okay, seat place 3D boarding time,

68
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,779
1540. All right, what about on the back? Global travel airways. We're going to have to give them

69
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:19,850
a call. Here, look. The A&W root beer key. And it's got a weird pattern on it. We might have to

70
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,389
put that in a weird pattern. Wouldn't you want your locked box to have the very basic standard

71
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:38,179
key? Because I know that this key goes to that. A&W. Same as the desk. This canister looks to

72
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:45,610
have been used as a homemade smoke bomb. What? How do you make a homemade...

73
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:59,909
It's like Chef Boyardee and battery acid? I don't understand. Can smoke bomb? Okay. Well, I got it.

74
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:08,580
Oh my god. Don't hang up on me. Yes, Deidre. What is it? You know where I am right now? Salem.

75
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:19,610
Salem? As in which trial, Salem? Avi. Chug what's left. My cousin had gotten into some trouble here

76
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:26,250
and I thought I could help her out. But it turns out that the situation is much more complicated

77
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:36,169
than I anticipated. So now I'm calling you to ask for some guidance. You want my help? Yes. Yes.

78
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:44,570
Don't make this more painful. I could use your professional opinion, okay? Well, it so happens

79
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:51,129
that the case I'm on is connected to Boston, which is just nearby Salem, and I was never a big

80
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:58,409
believer in coincidences. Oh. I have a good blurry eyesight. I'd love to. I'm not a great detective.

81
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:02,250
You don't have to wear glasses. I thought I had reached a dead end, but it looks like I have to go

82
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,250
to Massachusetts anyway. In any case, a fresh perspective would do me good. Oh, you're already

83
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:16,330
annoying me and you're not even here yet. You're welcome. I get the feel she's focusing on the can.

84
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,769
If I look over here, my eyes are ripped down, still focused on the can.

85
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:30,419
That would hurt. Automatic long letter grid if I could drive this.

86
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,139
I appreciate you coming here, Drew. I'm just glad you didn't change your mind and leave me

87
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:44,009
at the airport. I'd have crossed my mind. Keep the excessive cheeriness under control

88
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,570
and we'll be fine. Hey, eyes on the road. No promises. Where were you, by the way? Eyes on the road.

89
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:57,049
Did I interrupt a vacation with Ned? Didn't you bring me here to help with a case?

90
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,250
Yes, I did. And that's it.

91
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,190
Grabbed the shift.

92
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,409
The house wasn't completely destroyed, but the person who lived there had to move out.

93
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,970
Oh, you drive a stick. This is my case. I know you're a...

94
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,490
Why am I leaning the other way? I'm like sitting down and looking up. Where am I?

95
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,250
Why was I down there?

96
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,250
Is this the car ride? I'm going to tell you how it is car ride.

97
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,649
What's that? What's that say?

98
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,250
What is that? Is that an ejector?

99
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,380
I can't see where your mouse is. Oh, it's that problem again.

100
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,460
I can't see where my fucking mouse is. God damn it.

101
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,349
All right. Where's my mouse? No, no, no. This, this thing over here before it gets cut off.

102
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,319
The thing that looked all the way to the right. Looks like an ejector seat thing. The lever.

103
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:48,069
All right. Let me fix this. How did I fix this last time? How did I fix this last?

104
00:17:48,069 --> 00:18:02,359
I think the stream crashing broke this. I think I just broke it. It was like that before too.

105
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:25,420
Is that going to work? I broke it. All right. Capture the screen.

106
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:33,049
Why is it scaling? Oh, I hate this program with a passion. This is it. This is it.

107
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:37,930
This is the stream where I don't use Streamlabs OBS ever again. This is it. This is the one.

108
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:48,470
Okay. Not using it ever again. All right. So you get to capture the fucking screen. What are you

109
00:18:48,470 --> 00:19:05,140
doing? That's not even right. It's incorrect. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you

110
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:36,069
doing? I made it worse. No, I didn't. Clipping. Where? Professional streamer. No, professional

111
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:53,829
streamer using shit software is what happens. All right. Let's go. Why don't we start with your

112
00:19:53,829 --> 00:20:05,900
extended family? They're cousins. The Perry's. P-A-R-R-Y. Oh, like in fencing. Yes. Tegan is the

113
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:12,140
older one. May is younger. They've, they had a difficult time. Dude, if I could keep my stream

114
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,500
turned on, I would uninstall this on Streamlabs OBS just regularly again. On the most important

115
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:27,829
historic mansion in Salem. And I know it's not true. I know it. We haven't taken a single turn,

116
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:36,619
by the way. This is, wherever we're going is in a straight line. This is it. All right. We've

117
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:43,509
never even taken one turn. What can you tell me about May? She has a reputation as a troublemaker.

118
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:49,750
I feel like I'm sitting in a studio of being manipulated. This is being keyed in. We haven't

119
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,750
moved. Sometimes she can even sense things before they happen. Odd how? I don't know. Troubled dean

120
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:03,700
stuff. Difficult time as a kid. Oddest thing is she won't give an alibi. That's what we do.

121
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:12,259
Suspicious. That's the problem. Everyone is so suspicious of her. How is this the stream that

122
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:18,019
you stop using Streamlabs if the stream isn't canon? Sounds like we should talk to her soon.

123
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:28,140
Where do you think we're going? What does Tegan think about this? She's worried about May,

124
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:35,740
obviously. Tegan isn't like May. She's upstanding. She works at the Salem Museum and doesn't know a

125
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:44,470
thing about criminal cases, which is why she contacted me. Is there like I don't have any

126
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,109
more questions? I don't I don't have one more question. I don't want I don't have any more

127
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:56,069
questions. The Hathorn house and it's old. Like really old. And now it's been set on fire.

128
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,549
Nothing else significant about it? Well, yeah. That's kind of why you're here, which is why.

129
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:12,519
All right, we got it. Here's the house. The Perry house.

130
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,880
What do you mean haunted? Get out of the car, Nancy. Exactly that. There's ghosts. Deirdre.

131
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,680
I don't believe it either, Drew. But I can't explain it. Everyone seems to think they exist.

132
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,720
With so many sightings, even if it isn't real ghosts, something is definitely going on. I

133
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:45,000
thought that maybe you can disprove them. So would you please get out of my car and come inside?

134
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:59,180
This looks like a house that's currently occupied. Side by side. You'd better learn to keep up with

135
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:11,109
me. You must be Nancy. Thank you so much for coming. Am I is this like a do I like investigate

136
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:14,309
ghosts? You know, you live in the same neighborhood for 20 years and you'd expect your neighbors to

137
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:18,549
be a little more understanding when your family is false. Did Nancy Drew do this before the

138
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:27,349
conjuring? Oh, I'm sorry. How are you, Deirdre? I'm good. Thanks. Tegan Perry. Welcome to my home.

139
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:32,869
Welcome. Hi. Although right now, my parents are literally on safari in Namibia. So while their

140
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,950
daughter is being convicted of a crime she didn't commit, I'm taking care of things around here.

141
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:43,829
They'll be home soon. We're a very expensive courier is tracking them down in the bush.

142
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:48,230
Top notch. I found him on the internet. Deirdre tells me you'll be assisting her in clearing my

143
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:56,069
sister's name. Assisting? Yeah. She's innocent. I don't know why she won't help herself. She's got

144
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,099
difficult reputation. Well, you know, Deirdre, what people here can be like. She doesn't trust

145
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:09,220
easily. I'm sorry. Are you hungry? There's clam chowder. Homemade. Oh, clam chowder? I

146
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,259
wear a fucking new wiggler and I'm fucking blotted. I remember blotting a new wiggler.

147
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:17,539
Deirdre, sorry. You're bunking with me. Oh, I almost forgot. After you girls get comfortable,

148
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,779
you two should swing by the museum. Might as well take in some history while you're here, right?

149
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:29,299
Just don't get suckered into that witch's walking tour. Olivia Ravencroft is not a witch. She would

150
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,779
have you believing all kinds of nonsense about the town being full of goats. I thought you two

151
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:38,660
used to be friends. That was a long time ago. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta get going. I'm running

152
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,220
late to an appointment. That's the villain. Thanks, Tegan. I appreciate you. That's the villain

153
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,579
with the smoke. Before you go, do you have time for a quick question? Nancy, we just got here.

154
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:53,140
That's the only thing you eat in Boston. Sorry. I know you're in a rush. It would really help.

155
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:59,509
Of course. I have time for one question. If it'll help. What can you tell me where the fire

156
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:07,609
happened? Do you mind introducing me to May? What can you tell me about the fire?

157
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,289
What have you heard about it? Look, I appreciate you want the quickest way to know that you are

158
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:18,009
responsible. What about that fire? What do you know about the fire? What do you know about that?

159
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:25,289
That's not what Nancy is asking about. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. I just thought since

160
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:31,609
the Hawthorne house is important to the town, you must know about it. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes,

161
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:36,569
John Hawthorne was one of Salem's founders. His large house estate was the oldest surviving

162
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:41,849
structure from Salem. Oh, is that all? Ah, ah, ah. That was two questions. I said one.

163
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:49,450
But yes, it was also the big time judge that presided over the Salem witch trial. Is there

164
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:56,730
some other fire I need to know about? No. May's accident was in a fire. I just don't want her

165
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:03,210
getting upset with unnecessary questions about things long over. I understand. You can read all

166
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:13,579
about Judge Hawthorne and you come to the museum later. All right, so turn on faucet. First thing

167
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:17,980
I'm going to try. You jerk. Tegan said you've been in town for days, but you haven't come by.

168
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,140
I know. I know. I had to check in with your case at the uh. I feel like I'm watching somebody that

169
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,259
made it in the cinema. I didn't want to bother you. How are you holding up? And it was not,

170
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,700
it was like an experiment that we're going to try to see if they get a camera in the house.

171
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,740
Hey, at least I got you to get off your butt and finally visit me.

172
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:50,579
Oh, this is the girl I was telling you about. Nancy Drew. Nice to meet you. Okay, well see you

173
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,660
later. She really doesn't want to talk. This could be difficult. That wasn't even that. No,

174
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,900
no, no. That was not being ignored. That was I didn't see you. I'll be in the kitchen. You're

175
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:09,109
not in the house. All right, let's go through their drawers and stuff.

176
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,990
Green power. Oil. You keep all your oils and shit up on the wind direct sunlight.

177
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:32,220
That's new. Don't do that. All right, stove. Open the stove. Go to the fridge. Huh? Candle.

178
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:41,640
Just a gross candle on the counter. Huh? An evil candle on the counter. Cool.

179
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:50,809
With matches with your nice flowers and nothing there. The kitchen table has a great view out

180
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:59,750
into the neighborhood. Eat the candle. You know I would. If I could, you know I would. Key like

181
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:18,359
hidden in shoe. Uh, no wait down here. Deirdre would be upset if I left without her. Can I just

182
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:28,170
turn on the lights? Okay, hold on. Should I introduce myself? Whoa, you got right in there.

183
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:36,650
The way that I'm moving, I'm the ghost. All right, can't spray. Rust be gone. Now that's handy.

184
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,690
Never know when a bit of stubborn iron oxide will get in the way of investigating.

185
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:51,349
Take it. All right, so what is it? Rust be gone. Use rust be gone. I got rust be gone. What's this?

186
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:58,009
Hiking the Patagonian Highland. Yeah, that's good. Remember that symbol if I'm needed later.

187
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:10,940
Oh found it. What did I find? An egg? I didn't know I was on it. Is this how they like keep me

188
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:19,579
occupied? You know Nancy's coming over so just just hide a few eggs and she'll eventually find

189
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:24,140
them and we can just you know we just tell her like oh good job you did it. I don't understand.

190
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:37,299
I found it. Deirdre's convertible. Looks strikingly familiar. Talk to the picture?

191
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:48,950
All right, let's talk. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Uh can I look around the house? Do you mind if I

192
00:29:48,950 --> 00:30:09,670
look around the house? Oh you're so weird. I'm done talking, okay? Uh okay um real photos of actual

193
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:19,960
people. I always find these interesting because what who are these people? They're like devs or

194
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:28,440
like cousins of devs or nephews or friends or brothers sisters children and it's always like

195
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:41,720
it's interesting. They're random people. Now that would be weird. Are there stock photos of like

196
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,880
we're a family like just in the backyard? Is there? I guess there has to be right?

197
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:59,000
The neighborhood looks peaceful from up here. There are a lot of them. All right I got rust be

198
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,940
gone. Can I spray rust in the bed? A good night's rest improves memory retention but it's too early

199
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:16,700
for bed. I got a drawer right here. A good night's rest. Oh you're gonna note. What's that? Found

200
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:29,819
Teagan's photo. What does it look like? Coven. What does this mean?

201
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:38,460
What? You're gonna leave that just in the a Polaroid of this?

202
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:56,299
Hey here's a Polaroid of me posing. I'm a witch with scary candles. Keep out.

203
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:10,500
Does that say wham? New England riot. Keep out. I was here. The Grim Reaper. Do not enter. Wham.

204
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:25,369
No parents allowed. Okay well I have photo now. Let's uh let's go talk shit.

205
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:33,910
How do I talk shit? What's my persuadability at right now? There's another room. Can I go down

206
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:43,740
this like hall? Go down here. All right I have rust spray. I have a photo. Here look I got a photo.

207
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:56,470
Look at this. Are you ready to leave yet? We don't have all day. Uh what were you actually doing?

208
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:03,509
This tour sounds interesting. Don't tell Teagan that's your plan. It'll give us a good overview

209
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:10,630
of the town. You mean I want to meet the real witch of Salem? Yeah I do. She might know something.

210
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,470
I wonder why Teagan doesn't like her. You don't have to investigate everything. Rust spray her

211
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:22,230
in the face. Olivia steals Teagan's visitors sounds like. You really want to do the dumb tour?

212
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:28,950
You don't have to come with me. Side by side. How long this game is? It does sound more fun in the

213
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:35,640
museum. All right how do I just leave the conversation? Why do I have to do every dialogue option? What were

214
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,000
you actually doing before you picked me up from the airport? You gave May a non-answer when she

215
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,640
asked why it took you so long? Because they're all working together. A non-answer? Yeah. You were at

216
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:54,680
your witch meeting. And I'm so oblivious that you could all be witches around me. I was May's

217
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,480
cousin. They started. And I'm busy looking around for weirdly shaped fucking keys. They think she

218
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,480
did it. Everyone does. So I went to check out the Hathorn house myself but I never went inside.

219
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,480
The ghost? What? No. There was some weirdo there who told me the ghost was going to

220
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,039
steal my soul. Looking for eggs. It was totally creepy. Yeah. And then I found out that everyone

221
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:26,920
in this town believes in ghosts so I. They're doing like a demonic seance behind me. I'm looking

222
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,519
around finding interestingly painted eggs. Did the police give you anything? Anything at all?

223
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:36,519
They told me there's a Judge Danforth in town and he's going over the particulars

224
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:42,599
of the Hathorn house estate. I found. I know him. Not well. All right. Are we going into town or

225
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,519
what? Yeah let's go. Sure. Who could gain something by burning down a house? Somebody. Insurance claim

226
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:55,480
maybe? Maybe. Possibly. See if anyone checks off those boxes. It's usually. All right let's go.

227
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:13,500
What do you think about this? What do you think about this? Nothing. Talk to Tegan in the museum.

228
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:27,219
Talk to Judge Danforth. Who's Ned? It's the voicemail inbox of Ned Nickerson.

229
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:31,539
I apologize that I did not come to the phone in a timely fashion. Please feel free to leave a

230
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:42,820
message after the beep. And then I'm gonna really piss that person off because they have a new

231
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:54,059
voicemail now. And it's gonna be nothing there. All right. Hi you've reached the phone of private

232
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:59,579
investigator Deirdre Shannon. I'm working on an important case and. It's a fucking android.

233
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,820
It's an android. Information you'd like to share. Please leave a message after the beep.

234
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:14,489
Professional. Deirdre is taking this very seriously. That's scary. That's actually really scary.

235
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:38,139
Do I have photos? Oh you can take photos in this game. Can I take a selfie? What else can I do?

236
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:54,969
Love you too. Can I write? Hey Nancy is the manager of the phone. My old acquaintance in Salem.

237
00:36:55,849 --> 00:37:09,460
We're into DMs now. Everything's great. Miss you. Miss you too, Nance. We'll have to catch up more

238
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,099
later. The bus is here. Okay talk soon. I swear I would have. We would have loved this place. We should

239
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,019
go here together sometime. That was robbery in the book I was looking for got stolen. What are

240
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:24,010
you okay? Yes I'm fine. I'm seeing this through. There is something going on and I have to figure

241
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,929
out what. Okay just let me know if there's anything I can do. I will. Love you. Love you too.

242
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:45,130
How do I put my phone down? All right let's go. Out. I just called you. Hi Nance how've you been?

243
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,329
Thanks for finally picking up. Well not good apparently. My pupils are fucking completely

244
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:56,409
dilated. You know you should really enjoy yourself more Nance. Life's too short to be working all the

245
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:03,289
time. This doesn't work for me. It's fun. Besides crime doesn't take a vacation. Speaking of which

246
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:13,079
how's yours? Yeah one second. Sounds like you are having fun. Uh you know standard fare. Nothing too

247
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:22,519
crazy. I miss you Nance. I miss you. Hey give it back. Nancey I'll call you later. What is going on?

248
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:40,809
Is that are we together? Is that my boyfriend? That's my boyfriend. So I'm gonna look for wait

249
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:54,150
look in the mailbox. Jesus Christ don't. Don't sneak up on me like that. Hi you've reached the

250
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:59,750
phone of private investigator Deirdre Shannon. I'm working on an important case and can't come to

251
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,230
the phone right now but if you have any information you'd like to share please leave a message.

252
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:13,670
Professional Deirdre is taking this very seriously. I don't want to call again. I wish I could text.

253
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:33,099
All right put the phone down. What about that car? It's a broken window. No it's not. All right let's go.

254
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:42,679
Let's go. Her eyes have madness to them. It's Google street view.

255
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:02,230
I've been here is exactly what it looks like.

256
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:18,250
Oh this should be interesting. The world would have you believe witches were not real.

257
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:25,530
I'm not talking about old ugly women who curse their neighbors and fly on. What is this? What's

258
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:32,010
going with the protesters? Witches are real. What's going on? They have always been real.

259
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:38,570
They are alive and well. They are powerful. Which protesters? Carrying the secrets of the world

260
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:50,409
beyond the one we see. Ritual, mystery, magic. Most exist now. This is mocap actor of overacting.

261
00:40:50,409 --> 00:41:00,599
You know what I mean? It is said that in Salem a coven of witches settled in recent years.

262
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:09,079
Set on revenge for the deaths of the Salem witches. Their ritual one midnight on Halloween

263
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:15,719
unleashed the angry spirits of the past. Is my mouth just open? Wait a minute that's you.

264
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,699
I feel like my mouth is open just like saliva is going down. Real history of the witches of Salem.

265
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,659
Same animation too. Some of my favorite locations in town and perhaps you too will see one of the

266
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:38,579
restless day. They've in Austria used the same kind of stage magic she's using. Thief? There was a

267
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:45,780
thief? What were you doing there? Visiting a spooky old castle. I don't know if it was worth

268
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,460
driving all the way from Boston. It's a long trip but I'm trying to make my friends happy.

269
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:16,250
I have here a photo of witchcraft in practice and all of you here are going to see the truth.

270
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:35,559
So here comes trouble. Me? Nothing too bad I hope. Did you know that in the Malleus Maleficarum

271
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,980
ginger hair was the sign of a witch? My kind of beef? I'm not nearly as talented as you are.

272
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:48,940
Oh that's not into it. You're making me blush. Oh there it is. Actually I think he thinks she's

273
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:55,500
talking to him. You truly are a witch. So to become a witch do I need to take a test or get a diploma?

274
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,219
A true witch is not made with pieces of paper. She is born to it and will feel

275
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:09,980
the call. A true witch. A true witch tries to study this. We don't need permission. We don't live by

276
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:16,940
the rules. Anyway what can I help you with? Now he's stuck in a situation that I think a lot of

277
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,920
us have been in previously before is if there's a conversation happening through you you can't

278
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:34,630
there's not much you can really do you could I guess step one step to the left but if this guy

279
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,429
turns and looks over here and realizes that he's not even remotely part of this conversation

280
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:48,019
then it's weird but if you know take out the phone hit a few buttons pretend to be on a phone call

281
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:51,860
with somebody that's how you get out of this otherwise you'd like this guy I don't think he

282
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,820
has his phone on he's stuck here he is stuck here until we're done having a conversation.

283
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:07,610
The bishop most nights it gets busier around Halloween and I'm sure you can figure out why

284
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,730
he's a blue tooth. How about the night that the Hathorn house was burned?

285
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,090
You look a little young to be working for the police. Don't I do puzzle games?

286
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:21,369
Oh no it's nothing like that we're just curious jurists. I pressed like my grandfather's

287
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,849
porn briefcase button because I've already spoken and we've talked about Salem and so

288
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:33,610
you were here. I was out of town. Did you girls know that Salem is haunted? There's a ghost here.

289
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:43,079
If you go on my tour you'll learn where you can find it. Get that candle. Okay um bye talk to you

290
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:50,139
later. Move me back. I want to I got a message. Hey Nancy Deidre gave me your number. Sorry but

291
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:55,659
before I was stressed. Don't worry about it and thanks for all right let me get the fuck out of

292
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:01,079
it. I take two steps to the right. They have the conversation up. Thanks for getting in contact.

293
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,780
Where did I find the museum? Oh you're so welcome to come by. We're on the opposite side of the town

294
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:17,300
square. We're on the opposite side of the town square from the courthouse. Just turn right and

295
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:27,619
go past the old cemetery. We can't miss it. Great. Fucking battery though come on. I want to find out.

296
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:35,239
You get the idea. Fire at Hathorn House. We all know certain renegades in this town know something

297
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:41,320
or two about fire. May Perry. You don't think she'd do it again do you? She was so young. Am I reading

298
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,079
their thoughts? Creeping around back alleys with her hood head down. Where there's smoke there's

299
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,679
fire. Hmm well with her history she's bound to already be in the sights of the neighborhood

300
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,960
watch. So we'll find out soon enough. My thoughts exactly. Am I inside of like this is what they're

301
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:09,659
texting together? That was uh all right. Road closed. The road has completely collapsed into

302
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:14,940
the sinkhole. No wonder they closed it off. The ground is still crumbling. I don't remember there

303
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:25,429
being like ridiculous earthquakes in Massachusetts. This giant sinkhole. Here's the courthouse.

304
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:52,659
False judgment. False claim. What do we want? Justice. What do we want? Now.

305
00:46:52,739 --> 00:47:15,000
What are we doing in the courthouse? Talk to Judge Danforth. Okay you got it. Hey what are you doing?

306
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:29,289
He's a judge Deirdre. Judge Danforth. Yeah hello. This is the restroom. My office is down the hall

307
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:42,099
to the left. Give me a minute. Nancy Drew. Carson's daughter. Yes and I'm with my friend.

308
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:53,219
Why do we talk? Is this a priest? Why do we talk through the door? Well you see no I mean I'd let

309
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:57,619
you in but I seem to have been locked in my office. No you can't come in the bathroom with me. What the

310
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:03,780
fuck are you talking about? I need some help getting out. But if you could give me some toilet

311
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,139
paper. There's not enough left. There's just enough to make it not be gross but I really don't want

312
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:19,880
to walk down the hall. If you could give me a grab me a new roll that'd be fantastic. Yes I believe

313
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,639
I gave a copy of the key to Alicia Cole as backup. She's just down the hall. I hope she's still here.

314
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:41,880
Wait so wait this guy locked himself in his office from the inside. Is that what we're led to believe

315
00:48:41,880 --> 00:49:02,780
here? That's not even possible. You can't do that unless you glued the door shut. I can't go in these

316
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:14,280
rooms. Ah yes you see I accidentally glued the whole seam of the door and held it in place for

317
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,000
three hours.

318
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,360
Hi so sorry to bother you at this hour but we're here to meet with Judge Danforth

319
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,559
and he seems to be locked inside his office. He said you might have a key.

320
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:37,559
Sorry I gave him my spare. Unbelievable. Does this ever end? What? Oh well then um he has a key and

321
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,800
he's only inside and we're gonna take if you don't mind me asking the lock to his door. What business

322
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,559
do you two have? And he's inside the door. We're helping the judge with a case. Anything I can

323
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:54,519
assist you with? Thanks but I think we got it. No need for a lawyer at least not yet. The diploma

324
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:00,280
gave me away huh? Aside from the cold coffee you're still drinking and the deluxe open box of sticky

325
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,760
tabs yeah you could say I know the type really well. Nancy Drew you really are your father's

326
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:13,079
daughter. It's nice to finally meet you. You know my dad. Small world. Books. If you need

327
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:26,570
any assistance or thick ass books. Feel free to ask. All right let's go pick the judge's luck

328
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:37,659
paper clip. Judge Danforth I couldn't find your key. What? Alicia said she'd keep a copy for me.

329
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:44,219
Well I did find a paper clip. I think I can pick your luck if that's okay with you.

330
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:54,869
Yeah sure fine. Oh no wait I have to actually pick the lock. Just open the fucking door judge.

331
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:07,110
Open the door. Just grab it and turn it. All right hold to drag pin. Feel for the pin that gives

332
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:22,920
resistance. Release. Hold to drag pin. Feel for release when the pin locks in place. Don't you go

333
00:51:22,920 --> 00:52:13,590
like it's this one. I had it. No this one. Efficient. How'd you learn to do that actually?

334
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,829
Online video tutorial. Someday you have to tell me about your secret life of breaking and entering

335
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:28,039
Drew because you're in danger of being cool which honestly I just don't like. Someday. What the fuck

336
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:46,469
are you talking about? What does that even mean? The game just crashed. No we just got into the

337
00:52:46,469 --> 00:53:10,650
judge's door. Arrested. All right hold on. That did it does this game save? Does this game actually

338
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:37,050
save? Stop right there criminal scum. Will we ever learn? Will we ever learn? There's been decades

339
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:44,889
of video game development. Decades. Decades of this shit and you're telling me that in

340
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:53,380
decades of development we're still everybody and this is from what this is from like single

341
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:00,090
a all the way up to the major leagues in video game development. Why do you have your splash screens

342
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:10,730
at maximum goddamn volume? Why? It's like do you not open your game? Do you not open the game?

343
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:15,130
You have to open the game like a thousand times in the debug menus. Open your game before you

344
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:23,030
give it to people. How many times have we opened a video game and it's like okay let's open this

345
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:43,289
video game. Like that happens so often. It's like how does that keep happening? Suffer me now. Why

346
00:54:43,289 --> 00:55:12,300
do you say that? Oh we got in. Like posture. That's posture. So you're doing that on purpose.

347
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:27,989
Is this money? Those protesters are out there again stirring the pot. You know this town used

348
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:34,630
to be. That's that's an oxygen mask. Seems lately there's been an element. Reused assets. This is an

349
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,070
oxygen mask. One of those troublemakers locked my door and threw away the key.

350
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:46,789
Now Nancy your father and I have discussed. Oh sorry I'm not Nancy. Of course you're not. You

351
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:51,989
look nothing like Carson. Did your father ever tell you about the time we won fourth place at

352
00:55:51,989 --> 00:56:00,230
the lake Winnipeg? You told me how you locked yourself in an office and had to have a like

353
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:05,269
17 year old open your door with a lockpick. She's working with me on the case. I don't know how old

354
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:12,789
am I? You're the one who tried to break down my door. Break down? Your honor that's an exaggeration.

355
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:20,469
I was knocking heavily. Look I'm really busy dealing with this Hathorn house business.

356
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:28,949
Being a judge is not as simple as you know investigating. Break down the door. Well we

357
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:35,110
just used our free time to unlock your door so I'm sure you'll be willing to repay us with some

358
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:39,510
answers to our questions. Don't look in the corner. Yeah how long have you been locked in here? Yes of

359
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:46,469
course. What can I help you girls with? Yeah pay no attention to the six bags of uber eats that are

360
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:50,710
over here. I was having the delivery drivers football throw them through the window.

361
00:56:53,429 --> 00:57:03,320
Sorry. How are you involved? I was told the burning of Hathorn house is suspected. I was told that

362
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,000
the burning of Hathorn house is suspected to be a case of arson. How did the police come to that

363
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,800
conclusion? The investigation found paint solvent residue on burnt embers suggesting someone

364
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:22,199
deliberately used an accelerant. Thankfully Mrs. Tuttle never had to see what became of her home.

365
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:29,320
And what evidence do you have that Mae Perry is the one responsible for this? Evidence? Have you

366
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,079
ever heard of recidivism? I don't know if that's what it is. Three out of four criminals in the

367
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:39,400
United States are repeat offenders and there's only one person in all of Salem who has a history of

368
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,719
fire related crime. So there is no evidence. What are you talking about? Not yet but there will be.

369
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,679
Isn't this a judge? You don't need evidence. She's already been convicted in the court of public

370
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:57,000
opinion. What is this thing? I'm a fucking judge. No I'm saying. I went to law school and she spent

371
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,559
decades doing this. What's Mae's motive? What does she gain by burning down the Hathorn house?

372
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:09,000
You'd have to ask her and while you're at it you can ask about her alibi which she refused to give

373
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:18,099
to the police. So any other questions? Sure. Can you explain to us how you're involved with

374
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:26,179
the Hathorn house? Well yes the house was built by Judge John Hathorn during the 60s and it

375
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:32,500
represented the oldest surviving structure from that era. Judge Hathorn was one of the three judges

376
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,820
that presided over the Salem witch trials. Yes and I'm sure we can read all about the home's history

377
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:44,900
in Salem's museum. More recently Francis Tuttle, Judge Hathorn's last direct descendant,

378
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,380
lived in a small section of the house for the rest was left. I was almost, I almost got your

379
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,340
master's in the league and you interrupted me. That's why the door was locked. A part-time

380
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:03,260
caregiver, Laura Bedroom in the carriage house. A few months ago Francis Tuttle passed away

381
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:10,380
which left Hathorn house without a legal heir. According to the historical statutes of Salem

382
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:17,820
after 90 days the house reverts to public property the deadline which is two days from now

383
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:26,420
at midnight. Okay so why to the book of apologies why did you need it? So the book of apologies

384
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:33,659
why did you really need it? Yes and first of all I'm so glad you're all right. Nasty business.

385
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,619
Had I known you were going to be put in harm's way I would have never called Carson and asked

386
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:46,219
for his help. So you're responsible for a magician stealing it? Trust me I can handle myself. Yes

387
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:53,500
I'm sure you can. So I've already heard some stories but would you mind giving me your version

388
00:59:53,500 --> 01:00:01,420
of why the book is important? Yes so Judge Sewell was rumored to keep a ledger of all the accused

389
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,739
intending to publish it to reconcile with their families and clear their names

390
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:12,699
but he passed away before he could do so. Going to Austria for a rumored book seems like a heck of

391
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:21,420
a long shot. Who are you again? I have been under some pressure from the AW group. AW as in accused

392
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:29,960
witches. All right well talk to you later. Talk to you later don't get locked in your office. Before

393
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:37,340
you go there is something else I need your help with. Not locked out of your car are you? Please

394
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:45,900
say yes. Oh no there was a there was an incident here recently. Someone broke into the evidence

395
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:55,369
room. Well I know not yet I don't think anything was taken. Never mind I'll call the police. Thank

396
01:00:55,369 --> 01:01:12,460
you for your time. Evidence room let's go. Photo of him too. Where's the evidence room? Evidence

397
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:29,019
room this way. How do I get in the evidence room? Scan the photo. Rust. It's a rusty door. Use the

398
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:40,340
weird key. Take out the camera. Can I hey can I go in the evidence room right? So how did your

399
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:47,929
meeting go? Informative. Don't worry come back tomorrow. Come back tomorrow? I have to go back

400
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:53,050
what do you mean come back tomorrow? There's a day night cycle in this game. What can I help you girls?

401
01:01:56,389 --> 01:02:07,750
Talk to you later. All right fine whatever all right let's go. Walk him back in the office.

402
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:25,380
They're protesters in a small town like this. What is that? What was that?

403
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:42,889
They're protesters in a small town like this. That was recorded that's like that's not an outside voice.

404
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:50,570
Skyrim mod voice acting what is I don't even know what that means but it's funny.

405
01:02:51,210 --> 01:03:12,019
X-Fox Mike. X-Fox Mike. Oh stop you guys are gonna hurt me. Let's visit the cemetery. I want a picture of little liberty.

406
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:21,190
What? All right let's go. It'll be more useful to explore the graveyard with a tour guide.

407
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:27,030
It'll be more useful to explore. No the game's fresh.

408
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:39,579
This way. The Salem Museum. What is this the bar? It's locked. We're going to the bar. Wait can we not

409
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:51,400
go I mean not a lot of going to the bar. All right the bar. Wait how old are we? Maybe we can learn

410
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,550
something about. Get away from me. You're just in the way. Look at how much okay if I move this

411
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:03,590
way for instance right I'm going this way. Now I'm gonna turn this way and this she takes up so

412
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:09,210
much screen real estate. Just like put her over here. Have her be like the Microsoft paperclip

413
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:30,820
that I can click on. Street art in Salem coming soon. What's this? Remembering the wrongly accused

414
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:48,969
may history never again be repeated. Nothing. Okay hold to look. Something else? There's probably

415
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:54,090
like a little tab I can push. The figure of a Puritan woman accused of being a witch.

416
01:04:54,809 --> 01:05:00,250
These were ordinary people just like anyone else. Yeah all of a sudden it's this this I'm

417
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:04,570
gonna lean in it's gonna be like ah they're gonna scream it's gonna be an actor that's doing the

418
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:13,269
I'm the statue thing. I'm getting unsuspecting people. The figure of. Now you're in the way.

419
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:28,389
Get out of the way. I want to talk to you. Wait all right I'm back. I'm here.

420
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:34,710
Hey sorry about the mess. We're in the middle of installing a big showcase.

421
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:41,510
So what have you seen in town so far? We decided to do the real witches tour. Oh no we didn't. Talk

422
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:48,630
to Olivia. It's a lie. What's with her get up? Witch? Street magician maybe? Everyone has to

423
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:54,789
make a living. Is she telling the story about a coven living here in the recent past? Yeah. Yeah

424
01:05:55,349 --> 01:06:02,630
why? Just bad taste. What about the photo of you that says coven? I hope you don't mind if we do

425
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:09,110
the tour. I want to see more of the town and finding out a place's old superstitions is kind

426
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:15,989
of a habit I've gotten into. I'm excited to look around the museum. Of course. We got a ticket. Wait

427
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:31,610
a minute. Wait a minute is this the oh it's a raffle ticket. Does this mean? Why can't I not

428
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:42,059
show this photo to you? Aren't you in this photo? Go on the witch tour. Admissions.

429
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:50,900
25 dollars. This better be good. Closed off. Looks like they're preparing a new installation.

430
01:06:51,699 --> 01:07:13,219
Stray book. You see it. I do. Told you. Somebody will end up reading this somehow.

431
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:20,389
What about this one? Sad that even children are named in the list of those accused witches

432
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:28,840
like Abigail Johnson. Just 11. This one. Anything else? Turn page. Wait somebody will read this.

433
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:51,159
Any codes? Everything you could ever want to know about Salem's history. From the Namkiag people

434
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:56,780
to the great Salem fire. Cool. All right so let's go on the tour. And this is gonna happen. This is

435
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:01,579
the intro of the game. We're gonna go on the tour. Something bad's gonna happen. This is gonna be a

436
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,940
this is gonna be a fight's gonna break out and we're gonna have to

437
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,380
this is gonna be a ghost that attacks us. I know I've seen it already.

438
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,539
That's the guy that was stuck in the conversation and he's still stuck and he's still pretending

439
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:25,460
that he oh no no never mind that tree with arms just proved us wrong never mind.

440
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:41,210
Let's go on the tour. I have a ticket. This tour sounds interesting. Welcome on my tour. Thank you.

441
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:50,729
Well welcome on my tour. Found a tablet. Is it which what? They give you an ipad?

442
01:08:51,449 --> 01:09:07,819
Look for the raven and place the tablet over the spots of interest. Okay look for me. So this is

443
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:16,500
not a tour. This is an app. Uh oh here comes trouble. How'd you do that trick? How did you

444
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:22,979
perform that trick? A witch never reveals her secrets. It's against the witch code. Magician.

445
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,859
A code. I thought bureaucracy and rules were. That's why that guy wore the mask

446
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:33,619
when he did all the reveal secrets on that tv show. I promise you will learn at least one secret

447
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:38,659
about being a witch. Remember that show? Remember the guy that did showed all the magic secrets

448
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:45,180
and he was in that that full head mask because he didn't want anyone to know who he was?

449
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:52,520
Talk to you. Like it was something was like somehow dangerous for him to not have that mask on.

450
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:56,760
That's what was sort of like implied like he needs to wear this mask

451
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:09,500
otherwise the fucking magicians are coming for him. That show was fucking pretty good actually.

452
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:24,359
All right look for the birds. How about this? Bring light into the darkness. Bring light.

453
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:40,659
Put your ipad on it. It's a very high tech statue or something that was made

454
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:44,579
until the judge caught her in the act and locked her up in a cell deep within the

455
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:58,060
Hathorn house. The statue was given the name little. I'm just doing what I'm just doing

456
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:13,289
with you y'all. This is real life. Okay uh cool so I got one. The big tree. No smoking. Wait.

457
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:50,420
Can't see it from here. Must be deeper in. Scan the raven. Let's kick on. This is when you start to

458
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:57,100
realize that like oh man was this like I didn't I thought no not anymore not anymore

459
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:11,260
they do like haunted houses and shit here now. When does this game take place? Today.

460
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:30,760
Oh it's just like it's like ipad like little ipad burn mark just like this thing is fucking hot.

461
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:40,539
I can't fucking hold it. Can't use that here. You guys have a okay I I'm gonna tell you I'm

463
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:56,729

464
01:12:56,729 --> 01:13:07,670

465
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:12,869
I use my ipad and I use like a game that's really high graphic integrity and this thing hurts to

is an info dump it's a history lesson if you just typed in right now I'm just saying I'm

489
01:17:57,909 --> 01:18:03,510
saving us some stream time if you typed in right now Salem witch trials and then went to Wikipedia

490
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:07,909
you get all this info and you could do it whenever you that's it's just an info dump

491
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:16,579
we don't need to know all this to understand that like the judge that we just talked to is

492
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:21,300
gonna we're gonna pull a mask off of them in like 25 minutes it's gonna be him we don't need that

01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:40,949

499
01:19:47,909 --> 01:20:08,489

500
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:11,289
I did your there's there's the statue in the cemetery

501
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:19,880
statue in the cemetery give the ipad back liberty did you forget a highlight of my tour many people

502
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:26,039
come here just to get a picture of it it is said to portray Abigail Hathorn helping the accused

503
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:32,680
witches escape the trials some even believe that Abigail's ghost still walks the forest

504
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:39,319
surrounding the Hathorn house her twisted soul now dragging the living into the afterlife

505
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:50,409
all right talk to you later talk with me again do you really believe some modern witch coven

506
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:55,930
unleashed do you really believe some modern about eight years back there were rumors of a coven

507
01:20:56,010 --> 01:21:02,170
that they performed a ritual to return the dead witches to fail to seek out their revenge

508
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:07,770
there any evidence of such a coven ever since then ghost sightings have gone through the roof

509
01:21:08,409 --> 01:21:14,729
Salem is now considered the most haunted place in the country and it better stay that way you

510
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:20,010
think it's a coincidence because otherwise I ain't selling ipad apps to tourists anymore it's so

511
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:25,289
haunted be careful everywhere you go there's ghosts everywhere please come back next year

517
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:13,079
just tiny and just a little girls get blamed for enough for you to be able to take care of it

518
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:16,920
and nothing bad's gonna happen the half-born house if that's what you're trying to get at

519
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:24,260
people with mundane minds look for mundane explanations how else could that have started

520
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:27,619
i heard there was not a single living soul in the house when it started burning

521
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:36,470
the keyword living is composed of two equal parts why did you pick the worst nancy drew

524
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:58,739
pain of existence that vibrates just underneath the light but if you were in a place like Salem

525
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:05,380
place where a painful history it's not me it's every surface i bought all of them there's a

01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:10,939
i think the feeling's mutual well he's a jerk maybe he burned down the hathorn house

551
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:19,260
what you don't think so let's go over the evidence that magic that olivia was using is so similar to

552
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:29,689
what i didra that magic that olivia was using is so similar to what i saw in austria i don't think

553
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:36,090
the witch of salem is burning anything except people's hard-earned money those magic tricks

554
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:43,130
are for kids if may were willing to get an alibi we can clear this up tonight she's not talking

555
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:49,449
to anyone it seems we are all allowed to enjoy some amount of privacy but her refusal to be

556
01:27:49,449 --> 01:27:55,449
interviewed leads me to believe she is hiding something i can't believe you drew i thought you

557
01:27:55,449 --> 01:28:04,300
were here to help you know not everyone can be as brilliant and cold as you are i'm not cold

558
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:13,180
and i never said i was brilliant either if she trusts you she'll open up and tell you the truth

559
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:20,220
and then you'll see you're kind of my last hope to reach her you're good at finding ways to get

560
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:29,640
how's the music do we not turn the car off usually so find a way i'll try the car the music from the

561
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:40,340
car is still playing it's 10 15 in the morning or 10 15 at night it's nighttime right that

562
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:53,399
oh we're gonna connect with the music i liked the first album better hey what do you listen

563
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:58,279
i know that you like this yeah yeah we were listening on the way over

564
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:05,609
first album was much better yeah too bad they changed bassists yeah too bad they changed basses

565
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:13,210
yeah i know right it's just you don't look like you listen to this music why does no one believe me

566
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:14,649
now you know how i feel

567
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:56,779
did you ever visit the estate all the time i appreciated it it's historically significant

568
01:29:56,779 --> 01:30:00,539
it was built by a cold brutal man who sent a bunch of people to their death

569
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:05,340
because he didn't understand them i appreciate being reminded of what happens when greedy people

570
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:13,939
stay in charge look i spoke with the judge look i spoke with the judge they don't have anything

571
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:19,300
on me all we need is an alibi and then they can't charge you with anything and they're not going to

572
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:25,539
have anything on me because he can't prove i did it then why not just give the police an alibi

573
01:30:25,539 --> 01:30:33,300
that's all they need i just can't it's not anything about me well i understand

574
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:42,939
but i can't help you or anyone else appreciate what you're trying to do not the puzzles in this

like way more than most normal people do for their passion projects

579
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:25,420
it's not a hobby it's more like something she has to do kind of sounds like i hope not it's like

580
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:30,539
her personal crusade like only she can make it better you can't live your life like that

847
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:34,329
the burglary i'm sure you've heard about the burglary in the court's evidence room yes

848
02:13:34,329 --> 02:13:40,810
unbelievable you know i've started asking myself what is happening in this town it used to be such

849
02:13:40,810 --> 02:13:45,130
as arson's and where there's a pattern here arson it's the kind of place i want to raise my kids

850
02:13:45,609 --> 02:13:51,449
oh you're trying to start a thing i mean yes i want to start a family but who has time work

851
02:13:51,449 --> 02:13:56,649
when is the end to be honest and the people living in this place like salem is not i'm not

852
02:13:56,649 --> 02:14:01,529
really into salem how about you i have a boy really he doesn't accompany you you know he's not part

853
02:14:01,529 --> 02:14:07,210
of your little trips of the thing that you're doing well he's apart he's far away and we've

854
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:10,810
been dating for a couple of years no one said it was easy it's not easy to do long-distance

855
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:16,890
relationships all i'll say is most men don't understand what we go through we have to fight

856
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:20,890
to get a seat at their table and then they want us to go home and be family makers

857
02:14:21,449 --> 02:14:26,569
some unsolicited advice from one working woman to another don't let his plans get in the way of

858
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:39,640
yours of course that's not bad advice does you do you you all right you do you they don't what uh

859
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:45,560
how about doing some follow-ups with the arson where were you that night where were you did you

860
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:51,479
burn the building down well i was at a charity fundraiser saving the piping clubbers anyone in

861
02:14:51,479 --> 02:14:57,239
this town fundraiser i don't think i'm a little bit surprised just being thorough i can respect

862
02:14:57,239 --> 02:15:06,649
that okay uh what who has access to the evidence room as far as i know just me let me in i don't

863
02:15:06,649 --> 02:15:13,130
like saying this but the judge occasionally all right sometimes the judge uh sometimes the judge

864
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:18,569
sleepwalks the man even locked himself in his own office for pity's sake not that it matters

865
02:15:18,569 --> 02:15:24,649
i was told the burglar came from the outside well then is it he's probably leaving doors open

866
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:32,569
liking me for this crime nancy no i don't like anyone for this crime or any other crime for

867
02:15:32,569 --> 02:15:39,000
that matter i was not here i was running errands what's the code of the evidence room do you have

868
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,319

869
02:15:43,319 --> 02:15:50,180
already lost it okay why did you bring your hammer drill to the office why did you bring

870
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:55,380
your hammer drill well after the burglary we realized that this place was in dire need of

871
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:00,340
higher security i ordered the keypad online and used the drill to mount it that's impressive

872

996
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:05,450
did i just get dragged into an annoying famous nancy drew finally arrived to solve our ghostly

997
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:12,090
conundrums what is this oh it's an obnoxious group chat that you can not get read out of

998
02:36:12,729 --> 02:36:16,329
and we're gonna blow up your phone all fucking day there's like 10 people in here

999
02:36:17,209 --> 02:36:22,729
and if you leave this conversation then we all know that you didn't want to be here in the first

1000
02:36:22,729 --> 02:36:36,329
place so you have to stomach this every single fucking day every day until you inevitably leave

1001
02:36:37,129 --> 02:36:43,129
the conversation and then you text every person that was in that conversation you say hey my

1002
02:36:43,209 --> 02:36:48,950
phone was stolen last night i have and i have to get a new phone number

1003
02:36:53,940 --> 02:37:02,219
okay i don't know this is just absolutely just gibberish uh we're trying to figure out what

1004
02:37:02,219 --> 02:37:07,500
could have caused you to see a ghost maybe an actual ghost like this only in the good days

1005
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:12,299
hey i'm here you know we know we know oh cute uh dude i'm gonna go follow some leads good luck

1007
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:34,440
where were you you know it would really help if i could get may to talk to me she hasn't given her

1008
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:40,920
alibi yet no and everyone seems to have one except her how do i know that i talk to one two people is

1009
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:47,159
it possible that it could be someone from outside of town a visitor or something absolutely but

1010
02:37:47,159 --> 02:37:54,090
statistically speaking crime is rarely a random occurrence it's a mystery to me what you have

1011
02:37:54,090 --> 02:38:05,799
anything you wanted to talk about crime is not usually a random occurrence is that true

1012
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:16,139
that feels yeah that feels that's like not true the person that like steals your purse on the

1013
02:38:16,139 --> 02:38:25,290
sidewalk is an old family friend okay what's the history behind uh the hathorne estate what's the

1014
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:30,489
history behind the hathorne estate that's how you pronounce it right well uh judge john hathorne was

1015
02:38:30,489 --> 02:38:35,290
born and raised in salem his father was a decorated military man who had many real estate

1016
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:41,049
holdings throughout new england and when judge hathorne became a justice he tried to expand

1017
02:38:41,049 --> 02:38:46,409
those holdings much of the land that the hathorne estate was built on was actually seized perhaps

1018
02:38:47,770 --> 02:38:54,940
all right cool is the fire somehow related do you think the fire is somehow related to salem's

1019
02:38:54,940 --> 02:39:00,459
history with what do you mean like is it meant as a symbolic gesture that was a european thing

1020
02:39:00,459 --> 02:39:05,979
no they were more civilized in the new world no i think they just did it for no reason

1021
02:39:08,899 --> 02:39:13,299
it was a random crime you know that most crimes are random right why would you even ask me that

1022
02:39:14,729 --> 02:39:23,459
pressed yeah they put a bunch of heavy stones on top of you a bit of days that's horrible she did

1023
02:39:23,459 --> 02:39:29,940
not know the way until she felt the freedom scarlet letter also a descendant of judge hathorne

1024
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:35,540
except nathaniel hawthorne was so horrified with his family's history that he added a w

1025
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:42,629
to change it wow the focus on descendants isn't really yep we think our world is so much more

1026
02:39:42,629 --> 02:39:52,180
advanced now we have a hard time escaping our past where were you three nights ago there was

there's these small obstacles that i enjoy working on and they're interesting but what i really love

1065
02:44:26,069 --> 02:44:32,229
is the puzzle of humanity what makes people tick why do people do what they do it's always the

1066
02:44:32,229 --> 02:44:38,229
hardest one to crack because sometimes we do things that don't make sense we're inherently

1067
02:44:38,229 --> 02:44:44,469
irrational you know there's a theory about why this is a great comment i know he's not skipping

1132
02:56:27,190 --> 02:56:34,170
i've been going around asking everyone in town where they were on the night of the arson

1137
02:56:58,569 --> 02:57:05,129
it really stinks that lauren is going to lose her home well we'll see yeah of course

1139
02:57:12,819 --> 02:57:24,219

1144
02:57:55,129 --> 02:58:01,129
the five community cells maybe the culprit wasn't among the living that sounds even harder to prove

might be footage from the break-in with all right let's go missing evidence and to get a

1321
03:31:32,889 --> 03:31:43,670
list of everything that's missing judge i'm afraid i haven't been completely honest with you nancy

1322
03:31:44,629 --> 03:31:51,860
what let's just say i can tell when someone is trying to hide something from me the reason

1323
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:58,420
karson sent you to mosem castle was because i already knew what was stolen from the courthouse

1324
03:31:58,420 --> 03:32:03,940
tegan perry had assembled a packet of documents outlining her accused witch's claims on the

1325
03:32:03,940 --> 03:32:11,370
half-born house they were compelling and i believe she had a real claim but now missing

1326
03:32:14,459 --> 03:32:18,059
someone from sweden i must admit that i've already figured out the entire storyline

1327
03:32:18,059 --> 03:32:19,899
i'll hold my tongue for you americans though

1328
03:32:19,899 --> 03:32:31,049
oh

1329
03:32:31,049 --> 03:32:39,190
uh okay do you remember do you have the cctv footage from the break-in yes we do

1330
03:32:40,389 --> 03:32:45,620
huh and completely forgot didn't even turn the cameras off and he broke into his own house

1331
03:32:47,059 --> 03:32:50,420
of course oh you see nancy i haven't been completely honest with you

1332
03:32:51,780 --> 03:32:57,540
you know how i locked myself in places well i was going in the evidence room to get a snack

1333
03:32:58,500 --> 03:33:05,219
and then i got stuck in the cage so i just picked up the computer desk and smashed it into the window

1334
03:33:06,340 --> 03:33:15,540
and climbed out i do this once in a week i need help i need to be helped do you remember any

1335
03:33:15,540 --> 03:33:23,620
details about the aw evidence i don't remember much unfortunately oh there was this key with

1336
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:33,700
its blade shape to spell aw very not sure what it was connected to like this one yes that's it

1337
03:33:33,700 --> 03:33:40,020
where did you find this just missing a ton of painful reverb yeah the theft of the book of

1338
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:45,860
apologies and the theft of evidence from the courthouse someone is going to great lengths

1339
03:33:45,860 --> 03:33:52,100
to prevent the aw organization from having a claim on the half-born estate any educated

1340
03:33:52,260 --> 03:34:00,579
guess who that might be practically everybody in this town everyone has a carnival attraction

1341
03:34:00,579 --> 03:34:06,860
and i'm sure lauren carnival oh i love carnivals have to dig deeper well you'll need to do it

1342
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:43,590
quickly i unfortunately must file the second bugleberry is it audible two thousand people

1343
03:34:43,590 --> 03:35:02,729
leave okay what evidence who cares that is a somewhat complicated question so many moving

1344
03:35:02,729 --> 03:35:08,729
parts and interested parties with crossover jurisdictions you're the one who decides i feel

1345
03:35:08,729 --> 03:35:13,450
like that's like this on the same level as a slap i can tell you're not happy about being the center

1346
03:35:13,450 --> 03:35:20,489
it's pretty close well it's muddy legally and complicated for other reasons because it's not

1347
03:35:20,489 --> 03:35:30,659
just who lives there is history yes not to be taken lightly okay uh where were you when this

1348

1349
03:35:37,690 --> 03:35:42,409

1404
03:45:40,860 --> 03:45:46,459
i just want to say i know you're trying to help but i said you used to hang out with the the

1405
03:45:46,459 --> 03:45:52,700
hathorne house right you said you did you ever see any like ghosts were there ghosts there no

1406
03:45:52,700 --> 03:45:58,729
oh do you feel ready to talk about your alibi where were you you don't even have a passport

1407
03:45:59,290 --> 03:46:04,489
i don't go anywhere so i wasn't in austria if that's what you're thinking and no i'm talking

1408
03:46:04,489 --> 03:46:12,329
about the house the house that burnt down people tell me there's a good reason to suspect you

1409
03:46:13,049 --> 03:46:18,649
but isn't it obvious we've got a burn mark covering the entire side of my face and like most of my

1410
03:46:19,209 --> 03:46:26,329
arms it must be me i'm sorry that happened to you and i'm sorry if people judge you for your burns

1411
03:46:26,329 --> 03:46:34,090
i prefer it to pity would you tell me what happened there was a fire i was in it wait wait hold on a

1412
03:46:34,090 --> 03:46:39,770
second it's just that so far the main cause for suspecting you of the hathorne fire seems to be

1413
03:46:39,770 --> 03:46:46,649
this previous one i only want to understand oh okay yeah i was nine it was an old shed and i

1414
03:46:46,649 --> 03:46:54,329
wasn't supposed to play in it it was kind of a den full of stuff like candles i got stuck inside

1415
03:46:55,290 --> 03:47:02,250
you can work out the rest so it was an accident you were just a kid harsh to suspect you now

1416
03:47:02,250 --> 03:47:09,370
because of something you didn't mean to happen don't make me talk about it more okay talk to you

1417
03:47:10,090 --> 03:47:31,540
is that you all right i gather alibis for the search the house for clues

1418
03:47:32,340 --> 03:47:40,250
no i'm sick of the house is it nighttime yet it's nighttime no it's not god damn it who have i not

1419
03:47:40,250 --> 03:47:51,180
talked to about their alibi there's one person i haven't spoken to where were you by the way

1420
03:47:51,180 --> 03:48:04,739
where are you dear dra dear dra fancy zero it's not funny come on because now i know how much you

1421
03:48:04,739 --> 03:48:11,219
care of course i care dear don't laugh that despite your best efforts well anyway information i have

1422
03:48:11,219 --> 03:48:17,540
some information for you francis tuttle she's the former owner of what well i thought you were going

1423
03:48:17,540 --> 03:48:24,260
to read it all goes back to francis it all leads to here she took over the hathorne house estate in

1424
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:30,180
1992 although i found three different marriage announcements in the salem news she was never

1425
03:48:30,180 --> 03:48:36,979
married and never had any biological children the only living heir now is lauren holt she met

1426
03:48:36,979 --> 03:48:44,180
francis tuttle and was officially adopted in 2006 the judge said there was a will lauren confirmed

1427
03:48:44,180 --> 03:48:50,819
that that exactly but as far as i can tell there is no will nothing was ever filed with the town

1428
03:48:51,540 --> 03:48:56,420
just repeat the last word of somewhat important sounding sentences it sounds like you're

1429
03:48:56,420 --> 03:49:04,819
comprehending what you're being told confused yeah you think that lauren burned down her own house

1430
03:49:04,819 --> 03:49:15,110
sounds bizarre i know it's the most likely scenario it is because a historic property is classified

1431
03:49:15,670 --> 03:49:19,670
if it's a ruin versus being an intact that's right intact structure

1432
03:49:20,309 --> 03:49:29,379
a ruined property is preserved as is so lauren stayed there now living in a chart out building

1433
03:49:29,379 --> 03:49:32,899
that's the way to make somebody that's talking to you about things that they know you don't know for

1434
03:49:32,899 --> 03:49:38,100
you to make it sound like you actually know it already so you say it at the same time as them

1435
03:49:39,219 --> 03:49:45,379
and then they are just like oh you you know this already but you're just letting me talk

1436
03:49:45,379 --> 03:50:07,139
about it thanks for the info all right let's go all right i want something has to happen here

1437
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:12,500
i need to have something happen i can't exit the game but i need to something has to happen

1438
03:50:12,500 --> 03:50:20,139
right now no herbs no fucking spices no food no pancakes something give me like a give me

1439
03:50:20,139 --> 03:50:23,739
like a weapon to attack a monster with like give me the crowbar and let me hit the monster in the

1440
03:50:23,739 --> 03:50:35,290
head you don't feel conflicted so i burn it down as revenge for a three tituba seems as much an

1441
03:50:35,290 --> 03:50:42,059
influx have you ever seen the capitol building okay no not what not what herbs do you have

1442

1470
03:58:50,860 --> 03:59:03,219
on the ground she certainly doesn't want anyone else having it even if there are historical and

1471

legal reasons but like i said i don't really know her that well anymore can you tell me about the

1472

accident may was in when she was a kid why do you need to know that how was it important i didn't

1473
03:59:15,799 --> 03:59:21,000
think it was but everyone else sees reason to believe may is the one who burned half horn house

1474
03:59:21,559 --> 03:59:27,239
so that makes it important i know it started with the arson and she has other convictions

antenna to search for suspicious cold spots while you move around with the ghost wavelength spectral

1541
04:12:23,260 --> 04:12:29,979
analyzer 2.5 and look for disturbances from the other side the spectral analyzer anyway are you

1542
04:12:29,979 --> 04:12:36,700
sure it actually works of course i built it myself the device has a top of the line scanner that can

1543
04:12:36,700 --> 04:12:42,139
detect any disturbances it might not have found anything yet but you have to stay optimistic

1544
04:12:42,139 --> 04:12:48,860
about these things and i guess this is $800 paperweight thoroughly researched this shit's

1557
04:17:54,149 --> 04:17:59,270

1591
04:28:51,219 --> 04:29:07,579
there's let's see what else we uh mario 64 ocarina of time play them play them and then say like dad

1597
04:30:42,139 --> 04:30:52,760
don't tell him what the fuck really it's a fog machine affordable but effective fog machine

1598
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:56,680
should be able to cover this whole part of the forest in a layer of mist whatever happened to

1599
04:30:56,680 --> 04:31:03,079
good old natural hauntings there's nothing natural about our findings here this reeks of foul play

1600
04:31:03,879 --> 04:31:12,600
motion detector fog machine pumpkin head the house not burned down incense well you're finally

1601
04:31:12,600 --> 04:31:18,120
going to admit you were wrong of course not all we've proven is that there are no ghosts here

1602
04:31:18,760 --> 04:31:27,239
so you still think ghosts exist behind you they don't not exist say that again look the absence of

1603
04:31:27,239 --> 04:31:31,079
proof does not mean that we can disprove their existence but what it does tell me is that what

1604
04:31:31,079 --> 04:31:36,680
nancy saw was not a real ghost so who has something to gain by setting up a fake haunting

1605
04:31:37,319 --> 04:31:43,719
olivia olivia that's right there's got to be some evidence linking her to it let's go

1606
04:31:44,760 --> 04:32:24,729
about this magic is just aswd i mean clearly i'm moving around in the i'm clearly in a 3d space

1607
04:32:24,729 --> 04:32:36,870
right now what on earth would you i can move around in 3d space what on earth would i need to

1608
04:32:36,870 --> 04:32:53,450
do mist controls for and then you hold alt to have the mouse on the screen we've got what hey

1609
04:32:53,450 --> 04:33:04,069
before we do this shouldn't we call nancy what why because we're a team we should check in with her

1610
04:33:04,950 --> 04:33:10,950
let nancy do her thing and we'll do ours he just teleported he teleported is our thing exactly

1611
04:33:11,590 --> 04:33:27,740

1612
04:33:28,459 --> 04:33:42,779
okay h o okay then this is h o is that one this is a code to decipher we have our secret do you do

1613
04:33:42,779 --> 04:33:52,790
not have your secret decoder ring path to abigail hathorne woodley there's a gravestone map on the

1614
04:33:52,790 --> 04:33:58,310
back if this isn't suspicious i don't see abigail hathorne woodley's grave on here though

1615
04:33:58,869 --> 04:34:07,779
would have been too easy no matter we'll find her okay so you're this one what else you got

1616
04:34:09,849 --> 04:34:13,130
follow the map follow the map

1689
04:55:21,659 --> 04:55:26,939
you know it's good for business what i did isn't illegal maybe but it seems like you're doing it

1690
04:55:26,939 --> 04:55:34,619
to keep people away from what are you trying to hide me nothing joe what's wrong

1691
04:55:37,020 --> 04:55:40,700

1701
04:57:17,380 --> 04:57:25,240
version did you track down any new leads for the arsonist okay i'll go first so far

1702
04:57:26,119 --> 04:57:32,040
oh shit so far the evidence seems to be indicating that we should focus on may that we should focus

1703
04:57:32,040 --> 04:57:37,959
on lauren that someone is lying about their alibi well that's obvious someone is lying about their

1704
04:57:37,959 --> 04:57:44,680
alibi didn't you interview everyone everyone except for may but i don't think she did it

1705
04:57:44,680 --> 04:57:48,759
nancy if you're missing an alibi wouldn't you think that that person has something to hide

1706
04:57:49,560 --> 04:57:53,880
may is protecting something i think it was two people i need to figure out what i think it was

1707
04:57:53,880 --> 04:58:03,400
may and you well don't stop there go on i don't know yet you can stay here she said she might be

1710
04:58:44,869 --> 04:58:51,750
is that okay with everyone is it i've already answered a litany of questions from these two

1711
04:58:52,709 --> 04:58:59,590
you want to ask them i'm sure they'd love to tell you okay ow what's wrong with you

1712
04:58:59,590 --> 04:59:09,430
my hands feel like pins and needles i think i slept on them or yeah me too same what so is

1713
04:59:09,430 --> 04:59:17,580
anyone going to tell me what happened yesterday uh they saw it well they saw it it an anomalistic

1714
04:59:17,580 --> 04:59:23,340
paranormal projection you mean a goat that's exactly what i mean okay olivia raven olivia

1715
04:59:23,340 --> 04:59:29,099
saw it except she claims to have seen judge john hathorne not abigail hathorne woodley i'm gonna

1716
04:59:29,099 --> 04:59:34,540
be so upset if this is actually something different than all of you flashlight on his face and that's

1717
04:59:34,540 --> 04:59:41,500
the explanation with some fog machines i don't think so dear dra it's not an act she was genuinely

1718
04:59:41,500 --> 04:59:52,700
scared ergo no sorry not ergo er gut your hands erget poisoning you really think it's possible

1719
04:59:52,700 --> 04:59:57,659
mass psychogenic illness by more than one person hallucination leggo by echo restriction in the

1720
04:59:57,659 --> 05:00:07,400
hands and feet pins and needles exactly wait what what is that yeah but half food or drink

1721
05:00:08,040 --> 05:00:13,080
has been being poisoned this whole time i'd believe it what are you guys talking about

1722
05:00:13,959 --> 05:00:21,159
we could have been poisoned with erget poisoned what the symptoms match and it's not without

1723
05:00:21,159 --> 05:00:26,840
precedent especially here it says it here in this book it can actually come from the accusers of

1724
05:00:26,840 --> 05:00:31,400
the salem witch trials were exhibiting strange the culmination of the burnt sugars witchcraft

1725
05:00:31,400 --> 05:00:37,319
in burned pancakes eaten rye infected by erget spores and not washing your hands after making

1726
05:00:37,319 --> 05:00:42,759
food it was also pretty common 300 years ago i had an asahi super muscle builder smoothie for

1727
05:00:42,759 --> 05:00:48,439
lunch yesterday i did not eat some sort of pilgrim era right it's not urgot it's how could i get

1728
05:00:48,439 --> 05:00:53,639
it's like hepatitis a but i'd like to see if there are any sorry to burst everybody's bubble

1729
05:00:53,639 --> 05:00:59,400
here good idea but all the food we've been eating is my doing it's not so mysterious poisoning

1730
05:01:03,130 --> 05:01:09,750
you have e coli i touched raw hamburger meat before i made all your pancakes i visited the

1731
05:01:09,750 --> 05:01:21,110
hathorn house and i found olivia's jacket in plain view seems too obvious it is olivia has

1732
05:01:21,110 --> 05:01:26,229
been involved with some scare pranks in town mostly turning up business for her tour but we

1733
05:01:26,229 --> 05:01:31,189
don't think she's a suspect be fair they didn't eat anything you've made she was working working

1734
05:01:31,189 --> 05:01:38,619
as was everyone else and that was a will deaf okay no it was written by tuttle a letter written

1735
05:01:38,619 --> 05:01:42,540
could have been burned in the fire could be the reason for the fire that's true none of this

1736
05:01:42,540 --> 05:01:49,259
helps may that's right we need a perp a perp we should still try to find it it might be motive

1737
05:01:49,259 --> 05:01:54,860
i'll start with the judge i should finally be able to get the cctv access we'll figure it out but i

1738
05:01:54,860 --> 05:02:00,779
don't even know what an ergot spore looks we'll figure it out deer drove no oh time is running

1739
05:02:01,500 --> 05:02:05,500
if we don't clear may's name soon i hate to think what this town will do to

1740
05:02:24,409 --> 05:02:25,450
i had to copy that

1741
05:02:29,400 --> 05:02:30,919

05:04:09,290 --> 05:04:16,680

1753
05:04:16,680 --> 05:04:26,919
up what they're skipping through the halls this time i've just realized that this case has taken

1754
05:04:26,919 --> 05:04:33,159
a turn about what i can hear the protesters how do you figure intentional poisoning usually has one

1755
05:04:34,040 --> 05:04:40,919
to eliminate the target someone was trying to kill us ergot poisoning at high enough doses ends

1756
05:04:40,919 --> 05:04:48,119
and gangrene which yeah it's pretty bad but it's not death you really think this was intentional

1757
05:04:48,119 --> 05:04:53,720
and not some you know accidental ingestion if you look at all the evidence yes

1758
05:04:54,360 --> 05:04:58,759
olivia's jack at the crime scene spray painting at the perry house everyone's obsession to get

05:06:04,060 --> 05:06:09,740
was stolen you know nancy this detective thing is really sweet and all but we are in the middle

1767
05:06:09,740 --> 05:06:13,900
of something important here okay what what are you doing what is it what are you initiating the

1768
05:06:13,900 --> 05:06:18,619
process of handing over a half thorn house to the state so it can be turned into a museum

1769
05:06:19,740 --> 05:06:26,939
what it's our only option but you work for lauren it's her home and i'm getting her an extra 90

1770
05:06:26,939 --> 05:06:31,740

1771
05:06:31,740 --> 05:06:37,099
busy right now because we need to file this by the end of the day and may perry what about may

1772
05:06:37,099 --> 05:06:42,860
perry is she being charged i won't discuss this it's an active criminal investigation

1780
05:07:36,380 --> 05:07:44,299
it's been three days only daughter uh at two you okay how's the case coming along not well

1781
05:07:45,259 --> 05:07:50,060
i have a bunch of alibis but i'm missing something then there's the book of apologies

1782
05:07:50,060 --> 05:07:55,259
that's been stolen and the arson and a break-in at the courthouse and the judge called me an idiot

1783
05:07:55,259 --> 05:08:04,520
slow down what no excuse me what happened there what happened honey who's on your judge danforth

1784
05:08:04,520 --> 05:08:10,759
judge danforth okay look he's coming on strong trying to pin the crime on a girl without any

1785
05:08:10,759 --> 05:08:18,279
evidence it's a bit strange unbecoming he's supposed to be impartial but he's really going

1786
05:08:18,279 --> 05:08:25,959
after this one teenage girl may well look he was like a mentor to me in college we've kept in touch

1787
05:08:26,040 --> 05:08:28,680
but i do not know all the details of his situation

1788
05:08:29,560 --> 05:08:33,400
is he in financial trouble no could you make that happen to get a piece of property

1789
05:08:34,040 --> 05:08:39,959
i don't know which would be ironic because that's exactly what judge hathorne did in 1692

1790
05:08:40,919 --> 05:08:45,959
but may isn't involved at least from what i can see that's compromised ownership of the house

1791
05:08:45,959 --> 05:08:51,400
could be about the people may is related to go after her as means to hurt the ones she loves

1792
05:08:51,959 --> 05:08:56,439
it's extremely unsettling for a judge to do that but it has happened before

1793
05:08:58,119 --> 05:09:03,720
uh this is where we're supposed to piece it all down i'll talk to you later

1794
05:09:05,020 --> 05:09:20,919
i want to go watch this tape well i'm to us i'm hoping the cctv footage will prove it

1795
05:09:20,919 --> 05:09:28,439
bad news the footage isn't sorted we need to put it together in a timeline oh no hello i'm cammy

1796
05:09:28,520 --> 05:09:33,720
i can see that you're trying to find a suspect select cameras from the video source list add

1797
05:09:33,720 --> 05:09:38,200
footage to the timeline one image per numbered step all of your added images need to have a view

1798
05:09:38,200 --> 05:09:58,200
of the suspect good luck okay so he came into his office he scratched his head at the window

1799
05:09:59,000 --> 05:10:07,689
he went over to the corner sat in the chair is that different person they fall asleep at his desk

1800
05:10:08,409 --> 05:10:42,009

1906
05:31:44,939 --> 05:31:48,939
good imagine being out in a graveyard in the middle of the night in the middle of cemetery

1907
05:31:48,939 --> 05:31:53,659
that's right and a random lady comes up to you and offers you tea to drink you were barely able

1908
05:31:53,659 --> 05:32:01,500
to get your drink down boys focus where exactly that's when you start to run she had just bought

1909

1912
05:32:31,610 --> 05:32:36,729
sites around the cemetery so far nothing we'll keep looking but i don't think the source of

1913
05:32:36,729 --> 05:32:44,889
the poison is here don't worry about him he's just agitated with all the looks he's been getting

1914
05:32:45,450 --> 05:32:54,419
digging in a cemetery looks very suspicious okay bye thanks for confirming diarrhea anything else

1915
05:32:55,669 --> 05:33:02,069

had it expunged but someone found it the newspaper highlighted an arson incident what a rag yeah and

1982
05:45:06,229 --> 05:45:16,060
now she's gone missing so when they find her they'll really try to put her away may never gave an

1983
05:45:16,060 --> 05:45:21,259
alibi because she was protecting someone they both have they both have they both have lego hair

1984

that might be jason i know what it's like wait really yeah may doesn't really seem to be jason's

05:45:29,979 --> 05:45:36,459
type before she disappeared i admit i read through her phone she left it in the living room and why

1986
05:45:36,459 --> 05:45:41,819

1988

2069
05:58:24,919 --> 05:58:34,599
you okay how's the case coming along dad i'm i'm stuck in a car i want to talk about jason danforth

2070
05:58:34,599 --> 05:58:40,520
the judge's son he's a real piece of work i think the judge probably agrees with you

2071
05:58:40,520 --> 05:58:46,360
i don't know him personally but i've heard stories he claims that during the time in which the accused

2072
05:58:46,439 --> 05:58:52,040
witch's evidence was stolen he was helping alicia cole i guess he does work for her

2073
05:58:52,680 --> 05:58:57,479
claimants against the hathorne estate they're trying to take control of the property as

2074
05:58:57,479 --> 05:59:03,000
reciprocity for their ancestors having that land and life stolen from them by the original judge

2075
05:59:03,000 --> 05:59:10,279
hathorne and that's valid according to the judge yes but back to jason sounds like he's short of

2076
05:59:10,279 --> 05:59:17,400
cash constantly but i see him driving a fancy car around town looks like he lives a pretty

2077
05:59:17,400 --> 05:59:23,400
comfortable lifestyle to me money is always a prime motivator he could be receiving money from

2078
05:59:23,400 --> 05:59:28,439
someone to commit one of these crimes or he could have a financial stake in the property

2079
05:59:33,400 --> 05:59:37,880
but if he was tied into the he keeps looking up for it when she starts talking i can only

2080
05:59:37,880 --> 05:59:45,000
imagine that it's through his father the judge is he on your list everyone is a suspect until

2081
05:59:45,000 --> 05:59:59,099
they aren't you taught me that right okay who else put it on your little list the queen and the

lock open the key is modeled after the common convex type with 20 triangular faces five faces

2190
06:21:22,299 --> 06:21:27,419
meeting at each point the parts can be hidden or distributed to make sure the door is only

2191
06:21:27,419 --> 06:21:33,099
opened when all owners of parties are present even a single part is missing the icosageron

2319
06:49:37,720 --> 06:49:43,639
no problem why though why did you come down here you know what you don't deserve any of this doesn't

2320
06:49:43,639 --> 06:49:54,819
deserve it neither did those people back in 1692 they were victims thanks they went we're just going

2321
06:49:54,819 --> 06:49:59,220
to leave her down there she can take care of herself is that what you told yourself when you

2322
06:49:59,220 --> 06:50:04,020
climbed down we left her down there what would have happened if we hadn't come along we have to

2323
06:50:04,020 --> 06:50:10,180
give this will to the judge by the end of the day otherwise this whole thing was for not and if we

2324
06:50:10,180 --> 06:50:15,220
leave her down there stuck in those tunnels much longer we'll have some actual deaths on our hands

2325
06:50:15,220 --> 06:50:20,659
and if we go down there it's going to be all of us that's all right we gave her we gave her plenty

2326
06:50:20,659 --> 06:50:25,779
of air why nancy's here we poked a few holes i got into this case was because i care about my cousin

2327
06:50:25,779 --> 06:50:33,139
okay but this is what we have to do believe me i don't want anything to happen to me or nancy

2328
06:50:33,139 --> 06:50:39,939
or nancy either fine i'm trying to do one right thing in this whole mess are we going to see the

2329
06:50:39,939 --> 06:50:45,939
first time we've been lied to and i am sick of being lied to now i am taking this to the judge's

2330
06:50:46,180 --> 06:50:52,979
office because that is what nancy would want me to do listen i may not always be her biggest fan

2331
06:50:52,979 --> 06:50:57,619
but if there's anything i know about her it's that she's going to get herself in may out of

2332
06:50:57,619 --> 06:51:02,659
the tunnel safely at least she's gonna come up with like a fire extinguisher and be pointing

2333
06:51:02,659 --> 06:51:09,930
it out it's like i'll do it your choice i hope this is a very a very large irritant that'll get

2334
06:51:09,930 --> 06:51:21,720
in your eyes where we're not gonna get jumped on escape the tunnels it's never happened before

2335
06:51:22,840 --> 06:51:32,740
why don't we just leave with them is there any other way out we don't know she's dead

2336
06:51:33,700 --> 06:52:03,590
i think she's dead she's dead did i just miss a jump scare wait we're on drugs did we get the

2337
06:52:03,590 --> 06:52:09,189

2437
07:15:23,529 --> 07:15:30,490
we've been here all night i think it's time we retire you're not going anywhere perp excuse me

2438
07:15:31,130 --> 07:15:37,139
your honor it's become clear to us that miss cole has been the perpetrator of numerous crimes

2439
07:15:37,139 --> 07:15:46,819
here in salem including attempted murder murder judge please that's a very serious claim nancy

2440
07:15:47,540 --> 07:15:54,099
and this is a serious case people's lives hang in the balance this is very cute and all but

2441
07:15:54,099 --> 07:15:58,900
we have to do adult things now so run along everyone before your pb and jays get cold

2442
07:15:59,459 --> 07:16:06,759
i have proof it's all related to the hathorn house the future of which rests in your hands

2443
07:16:06,759 --> 07:16:13,639
so i think you should hear me don't i want to see the end wait show me the end what you can't be

2444
07:16:13,639 --> 07:16:18,599
serious judge this is clearly a half-brained attempt to delay what we have determined to be

2445
07:16:18,599 --> 07:16:23,799
a sound judgment that the half-born house should revert to the state we have spent most of this

2446
07:16:23,799 --> 07:16:28,279
evening going over all possibilities for how to decide the rightful owner of this house

2447
07:16:28,840 --> 07:16:34,040
and you've been very adamant that the state should handle it but we should probably on rush any

2448
07:16:34,040 --> 07:16:42,119
evidence to add i'm willing to hear her out unbelievable well you see alicia's been poisoning

2449
07:16:42,840 --> 07:16:50,680
lauren hult water supply alicia has been poisoning lauren hult water why is it so echoey in here

2450
07:16:51,479 --> 07:16:57,319
that's just too much after interviewing lauren hult and experiencing some negative it's so

2451
07:16:57,319 --> 07:17:03,060
echoey drinking her water i discovered are we underwater had been tainting her water supply

2452
07:17:03,139 --> 07:17:08,419
with ergot well that would explain my client's erratic behavior over the past few weeks

2453
07:17:09,299 --> 07:17:16,099
she lost her mother months ago and that woman wasn't it was raining give me a break

2454
07:17:16,099 --> 07:17:22,180
it was raining outside that ergot causes echo inside of your house you said she was poisoned

2455
07:17:22,180 --> 07:17:28,180
wouldn't that affect anyone's behavior what exactly are you insinuating that you know how ergot

2456
07:17:28,259 --> 07:17:34,020
affects its victims i'm not answering these questions i happen to be well versed in biology

2457
07:17:34,020 --> 07:17:40,340
all right but any tidbit of knowledge i have you'll just try to trap me with it use it against me

2458
07:17:40,900 --> 07:17:48,340
i don't need to do that because i found in your office a map of the hathorne house so i was i

2459
07:17:48,340 --> 07:17:56,979
brought what i was here miss drew your coat looks pretty soaked and muddy shoes water is wet and

2460
07:17:56,979 --> 07:18:02,500
it's raining outside are you satisfied with the ridiculousness of this yet how much longer are

2461
07:18:02,500 --> 07:18:09,700
you gonna let this go on it all does seem circumstantial is that all you have can i

07:18:09,700 --> 07:18:21,639
refund no i can't you can't play an entire game and then refund it it's almost eight hours of this

2471
07:19:45,459 --> 07:20:21,270
i just ran 60 seconds of ads are you seeing them nobody's seeing these there's 32 seconds

2472
07:20:21,270 --> 07:20:31,700
remaining no one's seeing ads imagine if ads appeared in the movie holy shit no one would

2473
07:20:31,700 --> 07:20:52,459
ever go to the movies can you fuck can you imagine this universe is finite its resource is finite

2474
07:20:52,459 --> 07:20:59,659
what i'm doing it requires back lobster fest is on at red lobster with the most lobster dishes

2475
07:21:00,380 --> 07:21:05,020
what do you choose how about lobster lovers dream more like a lobster dream come true

2476
07:21:05,020 --> 07:21:12,389
a butter poached maintail roasted rock all right let's end the game did anyone actually see an ad

2477
07:21:18,700 --> 07:21:30,759
no one saw an ad alicia was responsible for stealing aw evidence yes and i also paid 250

2478
07:21:32,520 --> 07:21:38,439
oh that actually hurt i spoke with your son jason he claims alicia forced him i'm sorry

2479
07:21:38,599 --> 07:21:45,000
is a grown man his actions are his own alicia lent jason her car then jason broke into the

2480
07:21:45,000 --> 07:21:51,799
evidence room and stole the files i have proof on cctv so what it actually sounds like

2481
07:22:00,919 --> 07:22:07,880
he runs errands for me all the time and how did he have access to the evidence room

2482
07:22:08,599 --> 07:22:15,080
only you and the judge had the code look you made 250 dollars for this movie and then you got an ad

2483
07:22:16,279 --> 07:22:22,919
probably apologies judge but your carelessness is the reason this happened in all probability

2484
07:22:22,919 --> 07:22:29,130
jason and i've been talking over the whole movie the movie was eight hours i doubt that he barely

2485
07:22:29,130 --> 07:22:34,250
spends any time this is i have been speaking over the entire movie you left it out for anyone to

2486
07:22:34,250 --> 07:22:39,130
see if he didn't know the door was unlocked how hard would it have been to find your key

2487
07:22:40,889 --> 07:22:48,169
miss cold that's enough anything else miss true yes alicia was behind the theft of the book of

2488
07:22:48,169 --> 07:22:54,090
apologies alicia was behind i've never been to europe how did you lie passport i heard the

2489
07:22:54,090 --> 07:23:00,090
judge talking to you about i never said that's not strange plane tickets in jason's car he admitted

2490
07:23:00,090 --> 07:23:07,450
to stealing the book of apologies on alicia cole's order order how did i order little jason

2491
07:23:07,450 --> 07:23:12,409
because you like when he cleans your pool or something right she likes to watch him

2492
07:23:12,409 --> 07:23:18,229
cleaner pool i don't really know to be honest with you i know he's always looking for money

2493
07:23:18,869 --> 07:23:29,000
he's in debt badly a fact alicia uses to her advantage oh this is absurd how did he buy a

2494
07:23:29,000 --> 07:23:34,840
first class round trip ticket to salzberg when the crime occurred because i pay him for doing

2495
07:23:34,840 --> 07:23:39,080
errands for me why is she reading this money however as if she's reading shit off of a bingo

2496
07:23:39,080 --> 07:23:45,560
card in a giant auditorium i don't know how we could prove that all the airline you can use the

2497
07:23:45,560 --> 07:23:50,680
plane ticket reference number call the airline they should be able to check the payment i bet

2498
07:23:50,680 --> 07:23:55,159
you it was paid by alicia cole credit card there's no way jason would have that much cash to buy a

2499
07:23:55,159 --> 07:24:02,919
first class ticket he obviously stole my credit card so you admit that your card was used to make

2500
07:24:02,919 --> 07:24:08,360
the purchase where are the police i didn't say that where are the police there's been no police

2501
07:24:08,360 --> 07:24:13,639
at all that he stole it the credit card company would have notified you for making a large

2502
07:24:13,639 --> 07:24:19,639
there's no there's nothing here how large is this is this room being recorded thousands of dollars

2503
07:24:20,360 --> 07:24:29,240
hmm miss cole if this is a court of law and the police were asking for probable cause

2504
07:24:29,240 --> 07:24:36,759
i'd be hard pressed not to allow it do you have anything to say i told him to get those tickets

2505
07:24:37,400 --> 07:24:43,880
you know your honor your son is a real idiot truly a world-class moron he couldn't even follow

2506
07:24:43,880 --> 07:24:50,279
simple instructions i would have had better luck writing them in crayon and this seriously this

2507
07:24:50,279 --> 07:24:56,040
is the kind of stuff i have to deal with i went to law school i have three degrees and now i have

2508
07:24:56,680 --> 07:25:07,750
an arsonist two ghost hunters a wannabe detective and her assistant hey what no trying to screw up

2509
07:25:07,750 --> 07:25:14,310
my plans all the people you pointed out didn't even have to take a mask off no the reason i

2510
07:25:14,310 --> 07:25:21,430
am going down is that this stupid little town is stuck in the past oh my great great great

2511
07:25:21,430 --> 07:25:28,150
great grandmother was accused as a witch i want repayment because i'm lazy she loved me so much

2512
07:25:28,150 --> 07:25:34,069
that i want this disgusting ruin of a house for free so i can run my luminous vegan tea grocery

2513
07:25:34,069 --> 07:25:40,790
store that is what pathetic looks like a bunch of whining moaning little people whose worldview

2514
07:25:40,790 --> 07:25:49,189
is infinitesimally small why alicia i just told you i just went over it to do something for this

2515
07:25:49,189 --> 07:25:54,549
town i care about salem more sorry i wasn't listening to anything teagans and lauren's

2516
07:25:54,549 --> 07:26:00,389
combined i care the most i was locked inside my own head leveled that old house a long time ago

2517
07:26:00,389 --> 07:26:06,470
and built new houses with all that land we could have a real community here we could bring in new

2518
07:26:06,549 --> 07:26:12,310
business that isn't completely relying on stupid scary stuff i am talking about economic development

2519
07:26:12,310 --> 07:26:17,909
on a level which salem has never even seen and who would be the owner of these new houses

2520
07:26:26,599 --> 07:26:52,139
hold that thought for a second okay the um looking at the economic outlook for salem to see if she

2521
07:26:52,139 --> 07:27:10,630
was right so there has been a 3.2 growth in payroll growth general fund okay current revenue growth

2522
07:27:10,630 --> 07:27:15,349
does not keep pace with the growth and current operations costs growth and property tax revenue

2523
07:27:15,349 --> 07:27:18,709
year over year ranges between three and a half percent and three percent still below historical

2524
07:27:18,709 --> 07:27:25,509
levels of 5.5 percent lower than predicted compression losses beginning in 2014-2005 are

2525
07:27:25,509 --> 07:27:31,750
expected to continue which improves the city's forecast for essential resource for years two

2526
07:27:31,750 --> 07:27:37,029
through five of the forecast uh per s rates are assumed to exceed the current advisory board's

2527
07:27:37,029 --> 07:27:53,849
recommendations hmm okay here it is forecast the general fund what 134 dollars that's not right

2528
07:27:54,869 --> 07:28:02,229
beginning working capital current year revenues beginning working capital 21 dollars and 98 cents

2529
07:28:02,790 --> 07:28:10,229
current year revenue 112 dollars total resource 134 dollars that's not this is am i is this like

2530
07:28:10,229 --> 07:28:19,080
a different thing is that supposed to be million i think it's million yeah value in millions by

2531
07:28:19,080 --> 07:28:32,409
the way value in millions 134 million in revenue by the way 2018 to 2019 136 million dollars in

2532
07:28:32,409 --> 07:28:47,819
revenue so estimated uh estimated ending working capital is 15.4 million dollars well after knowing

2533
07:28:47,819 --> 07:28:52,299
this case inside out it wouldn't be hard for me to get the land out of the grasp of the state

2534
07:28:52,860 --> 07:28:59,020
after all i've done for this community some recompense is in order so you're saying you

2535
07:28:59,020 --> 07:29:07,220
poisoned lauren so you could build and own a housing complex it's always a housing complex

2536
07:29:08,259 --> 07:29:12,259
and give me you were gonna level the national park to put in condos

2537
07:29:13,299 --> 07:29:18,900
money in real estate you know you have no idea how much money i would have made with condos

2538
07:29:18,900 --> 07:29:23,779
there is absolutely no way you could control it's always condos in apartments you could have done

2539
07:29:23,779 --> 07:29:31,060
irreparable damage so fuck that tree fuck that big tree it's been 100 years i don't care i've lived

2540
07:29:31,060 --> 07:29:39,779
for 100 years this town needs me no it doesn't i already have the papers and i am taking them

2541
07:29:39,779 --> 07:29:45,700
to the state office and none of you are going to stop me you can't cut down that tree yes i can

2542
07:29:45,700 --> 07:30:01,849
and there'll be big expensive condos it's an average price of a condo in salem massachusetts

2543
07:30:08,549 --> 07:30:10,709
so you admit to all of it yes

2544
07:30:15,189 --> 07:30:20,099
oh there's other people in the room fuck i didn't even see them for them to arrive

2545
07:30:20,099 --> 07:30:29,130
this is unbelievable only wanted to make salem this is really disturbing i am shocked

2546
07:30:29,770 --> 07:30:35,209
very shocked at what has occurred here miss cole will be held accountable for her crimes

2547
07:30:35,209 --> 07:30:42,729
i will make sure of it but as much as it pains me to admit she is right we do not have a legal heir

2548
07:30:43,610 --> 07:30:54,380
yes we do we found the will we found francis tuttle's will and according to her lauren halt

2549
07:30:54,380 --> 07:30:59,979
is the sole heir of the hathorne house estate i believe the will supersedes all other claims

2550
07:30:59,979 --> 07:31:06,139
to the property unfortunately the accused witch's organization has no evidence that says they have

2551
07:31:06,139 --> 07:31:13,740
any claim on the property it is what it is okay well what about the hathorne house hog champ

2552
07:31:13,740 --> 07:31:20,860
legal air twist three messages down resident sleeper had nothing to do with the fire you're

2553
07:31:20,860 --> 07:31:27,340
sure how do you know because i have a confession from the person who did really

2554
07:31:27,740 --> 07:31:37,240
me teagan perry intentionally set the fire to force out lauren and let the aw organization

2555
07:31:37,240 --> 07:31:44,040
take over the property that's surprising you say it was intentional yes i believe it was

2556
07:31:44,040 --> 07:31:49,240
and i believe that because anything less than intentional would mean people conspired to

2557
07:31:49,240 --> 07:31:54,439
withhold information about who was responsible and who might that be you should just play the ace

2558
07:31:54,520 --> 07:32:00,680
attorney i couldn't say it doesn't matter who knew what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

2559
07:32:00,680 --> 07:32:07,560
then she will also be held responsible for judge did you ever interview may get a statement well

2560
07:32:07,560 --> 07:32:14,040
so you just assumed she was guilty of the crime a case needed to be built there was no case because

2561
07:32:14,040 --> 07:32:19,720
you never miss true i asked that in this office you treat me with respect you deserve as much

2562
07:32:19,720 --> 07:32:25,479
respect as i'm currently giving you judge nancy maybe we should you made this poor girl's life a

2563
07:32:25,479 --> 07:32:30,759
living nightmare because of something she did when she was young she was a kid your honor

2564
07:32:30,759 --> 07:32:36,520
her entire life we're not in a courtroom you know the lawyer in a courtroom can you imagine

2565
07:32:36,520 --> 07:32:42,680
there's no jury here can you imagine what that does to her family to her well that is a bit

2566
07:32:42,759 --> 07:32:48,840
unfair you know this town has a history of judges not guilty sound jurisprudence

2567
07:32:48,840 --> 07:32:53,880
thanks for coming nancy tell your father i said hi you would be able to write that wrong

2568
07:32:55,639 --> 07:33:02,439
perhaps but my concerns are not unfounded you think jason is a screw-up now what would have

2569
07:33:02,439 --> 07:33:09,000
happened if he had been friends with her he is friends with her judge what how is that possible

2570
07:33:09,639 --> 07:33:15,720
i i thought at least i would know a judge is supposed to judge people on their actions alone

2571
07:33:16,279 --> 07:33:21,880
not the people they call their friends i just hope you remember that when you sentence jason

2572
07:33:21,880 --> 07:33:26,360
because his crimes aren't imagined does it be a real better audio book they deserve

2573
07:33:26,360 --> 07:33:38,619
real punishment just take away the puzzles and make it audio only i did it say goodbye

2574
07:33:41,080 --> 07:33:49,000
fuck these people i just wanted to say i'm sorry for what we always promised that a secret was

2575
07:33:49,000 --> 07:33:56,119
the most important thing in the world and we would never break it and i did you saved my life

2576
07:33:57,240 --> 07:34:08,470

2651
07:49:27,340 --> 07:49:36,580
do it hey wasad thanks for the 250 played nancy drew but not ace attorney and then the face that

2652
07:49:36,580 --> 07:49:54,709
like that i'm right in the middle but slightly angry about it uh in the pain index yeah i know

2653
07:49:54,709 --> 07:50:03,240
but the thing about ace attorney is ace attorney ace attorney is just i i the ace attorney is not

2654
07:50:03,240 --> 07:50:08,680
like a crappy game this grabbed me and i think a lot of other people in the first two three hours

2655
07:50:08,680 --> 07:50:17,659
because it was it was a little crusty plus ace attorney does this thing and i know it's it's a

2656
07:50:17,659 --> 07:50:22,939
thing that it's just a thing that i don't like about it it's the thing that i don't even know

2657
07:50:22,939 --> 07:50:34,659
if you can turn it off i've tried the game flashes you act with white flashing every 10 seconds it's

2658
07:50:34,659 --> 07:50:43,619
like that was all the time there is this white camera flash that does the whole screen

2659
07:50:44,580 --> 07:50:59,380
and you can't turn it off and it actually kind of bothers me you're afraid of the light why didn't

2660
07:50:59,380 --> 07:51:03,619
you tell us sooner well i i told you that i've just i didn't think i wanted to stream it

2661
07:51:04,919 --> 07:51:12,709
and also that's like that's like just don't look just blink when those flashes happen put on

2662
07:51:12,709 --> 07:51:25,590
sunglasses we would have understood no i brought this up before i i definitely brought this i

2663
07:51:25,590 --> 07:51:31,930
remember talking about this how i was hoping that when the the new remastered version came out that

2664
07:51:31,930 --> 07:51:47,560
you could turn it off and i don't think it did i remember yes nancy drew is more germa's speed

2665
07:51:48,360 --> 07:51:52,360
uh are you sure about that because i think for at least three or four of the major puzzles in

2666
07:51:52,360 --> 07:52:04,979
the game i just looked it up on the guide or asked you what the answer was but uh thank you

2667
07:52:04,979 --> 07:52:09,939
wild hubbutty for the 500 bits thank you for letting me be the germa one guy with that great

2668

skyrim routine that great that great skyrim bit you proved me wrong sometimes i prove people wrong

2669
07:52:18,860 --> 07:52:37,659
sometimes i'm proven wrong happens a lot thanks to the 500 bits a lot of times you've proven

2670
07:52:37,659 --> 07:52:51,900
wrong ban that person for life it was cad oh still do it hey abomination zero thanks to the

2671
07:52:51,900 --> 07:53:03,779
420 bits why isn't this week canon um well the first stream was not canon because joel and i

2672
07:53:03,779 --> 07:53:11,060
had some scheduling conflicts we were going to play halo reach on uh the first stream of this

2673
07:53:11,060 --> 07:53:16,360
week was supposed to be halo reach and then i mean joel talked and there was some stuff uh he was

2674
07:53:16,360 --> 07:53:19,400
busy with some stuff and we were like you know what fuck we'll just do it the next day so that

2675
07:53:19,400 --> 07:53:24,169
was the first strain that was just like whatever this is i'm just gonna stream because like i still

2676
07:53:24,169 --> 07:53:28,970
plan to stream i was gonna do but this is non-canon stream the next day um me and joel did play halo

2677
07:53:28,970 --> 07:53:35,689
reach but it was a disaster uh it was an absolute 100% completely unmitigated disaster uh so that

2678
07:53:35,689 --> 07:53:40,250
was not canon because it was uh all over the place uh so i figured okay that's two streams in a row

2679
07:53:40,250 --> 07:53:45,130
that would just sort of just literally throwing up dice in the air uh so we'll just keep the whole

2680
07:53:45,130 --> 07:53:56,250
the whole week is non-canon it was very good oh let me do not mistake this these last three streams

2681
07:53:56,250 --> 07:54:02,819
i have had a absolute goddamn blast on every single one of them i mean that doesn't mean that

2682
07:54:02,819 --> 07:54:10,790
they're canon streams i think it's still best you can have fun in non-canon streams was simpsons hit

2683
07:54:10,790 --> 07:54:18,680
and run canon yeah you know no no no no no you know sometimes like you do there'll be a piece

2684
07:54:18,680 --> 07:54:25,540
of media that's created and then they make it canon retroactively the nancy drew stream is canon

2685
07:54:26,790 --> 07:54:45,319
yeah yes no yes it is yes it it absolutely is it's happened in the past i can retroactively

2686
07:54:45,319 --> 07:54:53,619
i can make it canon if i want but thank you abomination thanks for the 420 bits thank you

2692
07:55:41,540 --> 07:55:45,860

about 30 40 minutes and then the stream turned off so sorry to those of you in the first 20 30

2726
08:00:51,180 --> 08:00:59,849
minutes of the stream that may have gotten cut off thank you everybody again for your ridiculous

2727
08:00:59,849 --> 08:01:14,360

2730
08:01:34,040 --> 08:01:38,200
community meetup in vegas or is that just another thing we can throw under the pile of things that

2731
08:01:38,200 --> 08:01:53,610
you lied about jimbo um i mean you you can add it to the list you can add it to the list i

2732
08:01:54,169 --> 08:02:06,099
i want to do i would love to do that but i it costs money and i've like i i i keep spending money

2733
08:02:06,900 --> 08:02:19,369
on other things for the stream so not now not yet so that i i think like having a big private

2734
08:02:19,369 --> 08:02:32,549
like party is is uh it might cost more than i think he spent that money on nancy drew

2735
08:02:44,459 --> 08:02:51,500
that's true that i some of your bits have gone to me purchasing nancy drew

2736
08:02:57,139 --> 08:03:12,470
uh that was an investment i very much resent that all right i just said that but people

2737
08:03:12,470 --> 08:03:20,840
people make like me me jokes about oh oh he if i told you that i spent 50 dollars of your bit

2738
08:03:20,840 --> 08:03:27,080
money at the roulette table people would be like oh gambling what the fuck oh he's gonna be rolling

2739
08:03:27,560 --> 08:03:35,450
that but that's but that's better than me buying the nancy drew bundle are you sure

2740
08:03:42,259 --> 08:03:56,330
i wouldn't mind it to be honest you didn't waste money how is gambling not wasting money gambling

2741
08:03:56,330 --> 08:04:02,330
money is wasting money with the hope that one of the times that you're actively wasting the money

2742
08:04:02,330 --> 08:04:18,069
that you'll get some money given back to you if you lose confirmed nancy drew complete bundle worse

2743
08:04:18,150 --> 08:04:42,549
than going to a casino confirmed anyways all jokes aside we'll see you tomorrow whatever uh

2744
08:04:43,349 --> 08:04:54,380
happens tomorrow i'll be live making some of that sweet sweet non-canon but finally

2745
08:04:55,659 --> 08:05:02,779
we had actually two or three more came in uh siku thank you siku for the thousand bits less than

2746
08:05:02,779 --> 08:05:12,500
five minutes ago i still keep rewatching your old videos they've gold that means a lot uh because

2747
08:05:14,180 --> 08:05:22,200
90 of every video i made on youtube was designed in a way that i would want people to be able to

2748
08:05:22,200 --> 08:05:31,130
watch them more than once and maybe still think they're worth watching i that's was that's part

2749
08:05:31,130 --> 08:05:35,930
of the reason why i made some of those videos was i want you to be able to watch them again maybe

2750
08:05:35,930 --> 08:05:43,319
come back and watch them again if you thought they were funny maybe miss maybe you missed an

2751
08:05:43,319 --> 08:05:47,959
easter egg that you caught this time maybe you have to go back and watch the whole thing check

2752
08:05:47,959 --> 08:05:56,580
out the easter egg there was at least two or three easter eggs in each video no that's not

2753
08:05:56,580 --> 08:05:59,060
that's not that's not i know people are gonna be like what the fuck and they're gonna go back

2754
08:05:59,939 --> 08:06:16,299
that's not true some of them maybe acting acting like you designed the videos i did i sat there

2755
08:06:17,259 --> 08:06:27,299
for weeks at a time sometimes on some of those videos people always wonder why did you only make

2756
08:06:27,299 --> 08:06:31,939
a video like once every like four or five days i was sitting there in the editing room with the

2757
08:06:31,939 --> 08:06:38,229
lights off just trying what what do i want here what do i want to do is it i do is that fun

2758
08:06:38,229 --> 08:06:43,349
that's i think that's really funny i like this it's fun and then you go back and you listen you

2759
08:06:43,349 --> 08:06:50,340
watch the same part of the video like four 10 20 times in a row and then when i'm talking about

2760
08:06:50,340 --> 08:06:54,580
i'm talking about like like a five second segment that you watch like 50 times in a row

2761
08:06:55,299 --> 08:07:06,459
ridiculous not every single video was like that but most of them were the developing room skipping

2762
08:07:06,459 --> 08:07:21,000
each frame of film from your camera in front of your projector that's right the the old way

2763
08:07:21,959 --> 08:07:29,430
that's true but yes uh i'm happy that you still like them because that's another part of the

2764
08:07:29,750 --> 08:07:38,619
fear of making videos or making any kind of content is is if people can go back five plus

2765
08:07:38,619 --> 08:07:46,229
almost seven eight plus years ago like if somebody comes back and watches these videos is this still

2766
08:07:46,229 --> 08:08:00,090
going to be will does it stand up i don't know hopefully it does it's part of the thought

2767
08:08:00,090 --> 08:08:08,340
process i guess but uh thank you cq and thank you cq again for another 500 bits

2768
08:08:10,599 --> 08:08:33,900
say for the nancy drew fund by every nancy drew game see you tomorrow have a wonderful night
