1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,269
So why can't I say names?

2
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,269
I thought there were like 50 characters in this game.

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,509
I don't know, I thought so too.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,820
But apparently there's only four.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,500
Oh, well.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Alright.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
There's 20 characters in the game.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Just go to random locations. Doesn't really fucking matter.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Like, let's just play the game.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Alright, let's go.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Oh, look out, it's a spooky statue.

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,679
Okay, so Jerma is the red vest.

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,679
I hear static.

14
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,679
Yeah, there's a tape.

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,679
Oh, get that tape.

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,859
Alright, we got it.

17
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,859
Is that something back there?

18
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,859
Can you guys see that? No, that's just like a tree.

19
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,859
So the closer you get

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,859
to the cassette tapes, they start buzzing

21
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,859
and making noise and stuff so you can find them.

22
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,859
I feel like Stealth, is this you? This looks like you.

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,859
That's not me.

24
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,859
That looks like Bizarro

25
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,859
MLC Stealth.

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,859
Turn around, turn around, run, run, run.

27
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,859
He's right behind us. He's literally right behind us.

28
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,859
There's this giant monster running.

29
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,859
Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,859
What if he's gone?

31
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,859
What happens if you look at him?

32
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,859
Is he gone?

33
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,859
Where'd he go?

34
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,859
I don't know.

35
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,859
Why are we all acting so nonchalant about this, by the way?

36
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,859
This is not running.

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,859
You'll never catch me.

38
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,170
That's not running. Are you guys all running?

39
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,170
Everybody sprint right now.

40
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,170
I want to watch people sprint.

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,170
I want to watch people sprint.

42
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,170
Let me sprint away, except it's just walking.

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,170
He's right next to us.

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,170
What?

45
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,170
He really is.

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,170
He's right there.

47
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,170
This guy's a fucking chump.

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,170
Where is he?

49
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,170
Where's the attack button?

50
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,170
I'm telling you right now.

51
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,170
I'm going to punch this guy right in his face.

52
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,409
He's not here anymore.

53
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,409
Oh no, I lost everybody.

54
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,409
You guys are right next to me.

55
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,409
That guy's a wuss.

56
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,409
Are you serious?

57
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,409
It was scary for two seconds.

58
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,409
He just stands there and stares at you.

59
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,610
He just goes like this.

60
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,610
Am I staring at him?

61
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,610
Why is my guy freaking out?

62
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,610
I think if you sprint too much, you get scared easier.

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,610
What's the problem?

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,610
I don't know.

65
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,610
He's behind us.

66
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,610
He's behind us too.

67
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,610
I don't know where to go. I'm going this way.

68
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,610
Let's go to the green thing.

69
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,610
The green thing is making us all screwed up.

70
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,610
I'm not walking to the green thing.

71
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,610
It's like a big ball of radiation or something.

72
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,610
Why is this thing emitting radiation?

73
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,610
What happens if I touch it?

74
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Is anybody close to me right now?

75
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,610
He's screaming.

76
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,610
We lost him.

77
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,610
I'm dead.

78
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,610
I went to the radiation thing

79
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,610
and he popped up in my fucking face.

80
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,610
Where am I? I'm a ghost.

81
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,610
Can you guys see me?

82
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,610
I swear to God, I'm a ghost.

83
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,610
Is there somebody inside of this thing?

84
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,610
I see you.

85
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,610
I'm going to come attack you guys.

86
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,610
I think I have to come kill you guys now.

87
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm a ghost.

88
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,610
That looks really creepy.

89
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,610
I can't hurt you guys?

90
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,610
You look scary.

91
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,610
What do I do? Just stick around with you guys?

92
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,610
Isn't this a Bill Cosby movie?

93
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Why is my flashlight so dark?

94
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,610
The guy is very tired.

95
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,610
And his flashlight is flickering.

96
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,610
His flashlight is flickering.

97
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,610
This rock formation looks like a genus.

98
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,610
It looks like a middle finger.

99
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Do not go to the green radiation rock.

100
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
I thought it was a super magic power

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
like I was going to get flight or something if I touched it.

102
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
You're right, I did.

103
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
I did get super magic powers.

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
You're forever trapped on this earth as a ghost.

105
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,860
Is this another person?

106
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Guys, come over here.

107
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
Where's over here?

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
What is this thing?

109
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
What is this?

110
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
This is going to kill us.

111
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Stealth died.

112
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
I don't see. What are you talking about?

113
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
That's where the person died.

114
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
What just happened?

115
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Piece of crap.

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
We just got you killed?

117
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,860
How did you both die instantly?

118
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,800
Look at this blood on the walls.

119
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
This blood on the walls.

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
This blood going up the stairs.

121
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I hear some white noise.

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I hear some noise too.

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
That's green radiation.

124
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Somebody touch it again.

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
That's like in the middle room.

126
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Stop looking at it.

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Somebody just poured it into the wall.

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Who just went in the wall?

129
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,420
Who are we missing right now?

130
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Who are we missing right now?

131
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,860
Boo.

132
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,290
I think Boo did.

133
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,290
Boo just teleported into the wall and he's gone.

134
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,660
What?

135
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,959
Don't look at it.

136
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,329
Don't look at the roof.

137
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,329
Stealth, why are you walking underneath it?

138
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,329
Why are you walking underneath it?

139
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,329
That's like a tear drop of radiation and hatred.

140
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,850
What are you doing?

141
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,850
Oh my god.

142
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,850
This is where we lose.

143
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
He's literally right next to me.

144
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,220
There's a tape.

145
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,459
Yeah.

146
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,459
Got it.

147
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,019
Six out of eight baby.

148
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,379
Where's the monster now?

149
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,379
Where's that pile of crap monster?

150
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,379
It's getting to a point really right now

151
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,379
where I can't even see on the screen.

152
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,379
Alright we have to turn around.

153
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,379
We have to go back in tear drop radiation.

154
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,620
No we don't.

155
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,620
He's going to be right here.

156
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,620
He's behind us now so we have to go in tear drop radiation.

157
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Are you serious?

158
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
We have to go back in tear drop radiation.
