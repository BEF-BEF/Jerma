1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,819
This is your new high-tech suit. Please put on the mask.

2
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,159
School is fucking fine. Why is everybody always asking about school? Like, oh, how's school? It's it's it's fine

3
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,539
Like what do you mean? I go home and do my homework and I get fucking decent grades

4
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:43,340
I got a pluses when I was in school, but that's besides the point

5
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,380
I've turned into your estranged family member

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,500
And yes, this is the three out of four videos on this main channel have been me talking about the main channel

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,020
So before we do anything before I talk about a single thing that I want to talk about

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,219
I mean, we're gonna put another video in here that we're gonna put a funny

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm gonna make a funny video and it's gonna go in this video. So there's two videos in this video

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,579
So watch the first video first funny fucking video coming up here. You're gonna be laughing about it. I'm tired. Trust me

11
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:26,400
So main channel here we are where one year of just about one year anniversary for my absentee from my main channel and

12
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,920
Let's talk about it cuz yeah, you guys have a you guys do have a lot of points here

13
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,400
If you're absent from school for a year you get an F you just get an F

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,739
So imagine like you guys are the teachers and I'm like just stumbling in with a bunch of notebooks

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,159
One month before the school year is over and I'm like just wait a second

16
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,400
I can take all the tests right now and I'll pass them and you're like, okay, sure you can I'm gonna pass them

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,359
I'm gonna get fucking at least a d-minus on all these exams that you guys are giving me right now all your concerns

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,760
So concern number one main channel what happened?

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,480
Well, a lot of things happened there are four projects that are currently being worked on two of them are already written

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,960
They're the whole thing's written. We just have to secure some warehouse space and then we're gonna get shooting

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,439
I would have liked to have started shooting already

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,460
but there was a pretty significant hold up and without giving any details or

23
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Saying anything is this is a couple of companies were involved. There was potential for

24
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,909
Me to get a very large production budget for one of these projects

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,979
And I kind of had to wait to see how that was gonna play out and it fell through so that's not

26
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,979
That's that I don't think that's happening anymore

27
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,740
But there was some potential with that was going to be the case

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,080
Now just like the last one got to get the team together strap on the boots pull up the pants and get to work

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,280
That dishes that was kind of a little at least the last couple of months was stopping our flow of quote

30
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Production on at least two of these projects

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,139
So once we actually get going not against the idea of putting out production stills or showing some sets

32
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,780
But I got to be careful

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't really want to give away projects don't want to tell you guys what's gonna happen in the videos

34
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,580
Because I like having to like the little bit of magic there

35
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,379
I like how you guys not knowing what's gonna happen or what you're gonna see

36
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:22,620
So doing a bunch of behind-the-scenes videos and production stills before you see a video

37
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,500
You kind of it kind of like blows it and you get to see

38
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,979
Everything kind of before you get to see it in the first place

39
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:37,259
And we're gonna get serious now about something that is hard to talk about and we mean about my like production

40
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,300
Friends and people we've sat down we talked about this a bunch of times

41
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,310
But I've never talked about it with you guys and it's money

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,370
And it's not a subject that I really love to talk about especially with viewers because

43
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,449
You guys at the very end of the day you watch the videos

44
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,659
You're never expected to

45
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,969
Give money to the videos or participate in paying for them

46
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,689
I have I've tried so long to have that not really be a reality

47
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,599
But I want to see what you guys have to say about it because we've tried like I said

48
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,599
There was a company that we've been talking to

49
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:19,740
For like a month or two now and it just didn't fucking happen and I can really only give so much of my own money

50
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,399
Like last time like last year the German rumble video that was like that was almost ten fucking thousand dollars in my money

51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,750
That I and I mean that hurts that hurt that that's like that's drain in the vein a little you know what I mean

52
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,730
so I don't know like is something like a

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,470
Kickstarter or a patreon something that I would want to do and that's gonna take a long time for me to figure that out

54
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:48,350
Because I never want you guys to ever be obligated to feel obligated to have to pay money to this channel for me to make

55
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,790
Videos you should just be enjoying them

56
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,089
You should care about enjoying the videos or the content whatever you want to call it

57
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,050
And I have to worry about paying me for them

58
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,329
And it wouldn't even be paying me if I ever did it like a Kickstarter for one of these projects it would be

59
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:09,449
only for production stuff for buying warehouse space for buying props buying

60
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,050
Hiring a crew I would me and my producer friend the guy that produced the last video

61
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,379
We've openly stated that I don't want to take a single fucking dollar

62
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,250
There are too many things that I want to do that

63
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,290
I would love to just spend that money on than ever have to worry about anything else

64
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,110
But that did this this is all stuff that has not finalized yet

65
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,790
There's obviously I'm not I don't have there's no Kickstarter. There's no patreon page for me right now

66
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,509
It's just I'm throwing it out there because I want to feel what you guys have to say

67
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,790
I'm gonna be down in the comment section in this video

68
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,670
Reading I'm gonna take I'm gonna put my eyeglasses on and I'm gonna fucking put them down to the bridge of my nose

69
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,829
And I'm gonna read like every single comment 12 times in this video

70
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,870
So, please give me your real

71
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,569
Constructive feedback for this because it's something that I'd really take dead seriously is what you guys have to say

72
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,120
Especially in a case like this other than that the second channel is going very strong

73
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,699
There'll be a link in the description if you don't know if you're kind of out of the loop on this whole thing

74
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,060
I made a second channel where uploads are very frequent

75
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,939
There's at least a few videos there at least two videos there a week and they're all done by holy mac

76
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,300
he's doing a fantastic job editing the streams and

77
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,939
The stream is going very well, too

78
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:28,779
I'm having a ton of fun on twitch Tuesdays Thursdays and Fridays 7 p.m. Eastern twitch.tv slash German 985 and

79
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,250
Obviously shout outs shouting out my other channels aside

80
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:40,819
This video is made I wanted to make this video to make sure that you guys are aware that I haven't forgot about you

81
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:47,870
they this channel is my life like it's it's it's I think about it every single day and

82
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,709
Just because I've branched out to a second channel and now a live platform as well

83
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,540
This there's a lot of stuff that's going on for this channel

84
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,899
And I want to make sure it's good and I want to make sure that you guys enjoy it because if I don't

85
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,819
Deliver then what was the point of me splitting the channels in the first place and I understand that I completely understand

86
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,459
Where a lot of people are coming from actually where they say like fuck man

87
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,850
This you had a lot of subscribers on this channel, and you're just kind that you just like got in a car

88
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,329
With a bunch of fucking stuff like a suitcase, and you drove off

89
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:26,360
And you never came home you got you guys have been like tending to my house here like it's just an empty house now

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,279
I took all this furniture

91
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,660
I took all the stuff in the fridge, and you guys are just in an empty room sitting here looking around like

92
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,279
You kind of come home Jeremy the answer is yes

93
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,319
It's just gonna take time and the projects that you'll be seeing over the next time period

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,240
And that's how I'm gonna say you know what I mean like the projects that like the four

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,699
Specific projects that you guys will see over time period are stuff

96
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,319
I really hope you're gonna get you're gonna like because it's stuff that we're gonna put a ton of time into

97
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,279
I'm really gonna put effort into them

98
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,319
I'm gonna try want them to be fun and interesting and it's not saying that the other videos weren't

99
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,569
The it's not like the other videos I've ever made aren't worth anything

100
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:13,529
They are every video on this channel means something to me very much so so please

101
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,850
I'm gonna end the video like this just just hang on for me hang on for me

102
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,170
It is this stuff coming if I ever decide that I'm ever gonna do like

103
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,819
Kickstarter or something you will know well in advance, but it's not happening right now

104
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,259
I it's just I'm throwing it out there like I said just please let me know what you have to say about that

105
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,659
because like

106
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,220
My brain is like

107
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,299
Scrambled goat cheese when it comes to stuff like that have a great fucking rest of your day
