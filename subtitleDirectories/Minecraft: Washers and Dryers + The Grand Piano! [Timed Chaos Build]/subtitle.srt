1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,179
Hey, that's what we're doing.

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,179
No, we're not doing a washer and dryer.

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,179
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,179
We better start recording right now, because I'm going to start fucking building it.

5
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,620
No, we're not doing a washer and dryer.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:26,429
Hi guys, today we're going to create a fucking washer and dryer on Jeremy's channel, there.

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,429
Alright, fine, right here.

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,429
No, he already finished it. That was it.

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,429
Look, it's a washer and dryer. It's a big square.

10
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,429
Stop. You already made it. You put two of them next to each other and you said, done.

11
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,429
Oh, that's it?

12
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:46,500
Yeah, done. Thank you, subscribe, and, you know, bitch.

13
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,969
Alright, I actually was recording during that, so that's fine.

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,969
And then it just like flew away.

15
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,969
This is the Aladdin's phone.

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,140
Washer and dryer. Alright, what are we really going to make?

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Alright, so did you record that? Because that was pretty funny.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,579
Yeah, I did.

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,500
Cool, that better be up.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,939
How about like, I don't know, like a jack-o-lantern?

21
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,239
Alright, Spoon, thanks for joining us, man.

22
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,909
No problem.

23
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,980
A jack-o-lantern.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Let's make a fridge!

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,120
Hi, we're back again!

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Done!

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Oh, there he goes again.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,489
Flying away.

29
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:31,920
Alright, so we got fridge, washer, dryer, and, yeah.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,739
We've got something else.

31
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,980
Oh no, what's he got?

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,750
How long is it taking him to get down here?

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,340
Ready?

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,920
Stove!

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
The stove looks eerily similar to the washer and dryer.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Well then, we'll just do this.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,500
Shouldn't the stove be like that?

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,319
Nope.

39
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,319
Oh great, now you made it rain.

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,319
Oh shit, I'm shitting all over the washer and dryer.

41
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,500
And I broke the ground.

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,739
I know what we're making.

43
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,219
A piano.

44
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,389
Three, two, one.

45
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,569
Let's do it. Alright, seven minutes, boys.

46
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,060
Hey, the piano's off! What are you doing?

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
The piano's not white!

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,060
That's for the keys!

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,060
The piano's to be up in the air, you can't...

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,060
Like you pull out the plates, Matt.

51
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,500
And it's just one of those like...

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,669
This isn't a movie.

53
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,669
This isn't like big, when Tom Hanks like

54
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,169
jumps on the thing on the ground.

55
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,169
Is that the piano leg right there?

56
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,599
Alright, that's gonna be one of the legs.

57
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,599
I'm gonna go over here to do a third leg.

58
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,379
Over here.

59
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,379
I'm just gonna sit here and watch.

60
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,379
Oh come on!

61
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,379
We don't have that much time.

62
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,680
Yeah, we can finish this, you guys.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Wait.

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm just gonna sit here and watch.

65
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Alright, no, come together, come together.

66
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,539
What is that? These are the legs.

67
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,539
Hey, you gotta do some work.

68
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,539
Why is this so big?

69
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,539
Spooner's not doing anything.

70
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,539
I'm doing something, I don't know what you guys are talking about.

71
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,539
Stop making fun of me, okay?

72
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,909
We're gonna build the piano.

73
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,909
I'm building a piano, do you see this?

74
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,150
Alright, come up with that leg.

75
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
One minute has gone by, we got only seven.

76
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,150
Everything looks very similar to that horse we did that one time.

77
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,150
Hey, everything looks like that horse we did that one time.

78
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,650
Hey.

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,460
I wouldn't speak about horses.

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,639
Alright, let's go, come on around here.

81
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,639
Oh yeah, I forgot, you are a horse.

82
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,069
Forget that sometimes.

83
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,759
Is that enough?

84
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,759
That looks good, yeah.

85
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,759
Remember, we don't have to fill it in, that's one of the things in the comments people were saying.

86
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,759
They're like, don't fill it in.

87
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,939
No, we need to fill it in, otherwise it's not real, and it won't work.

88
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,939
It's a functioning piano.

89
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,949
Alright, have this one come up too.

90
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,020
Too far.

91
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,020
This is huge.

92
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
This is way, way, way too big.

93
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,900
Okay, so where's the front of it?

94
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
I don't know.

95
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
We're just like in a giant black cube.

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Like four legs right now.

97
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Alright, this will be the front right here.

98
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,460
I'll work on the front.

99
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
You guys close off, this is so big, it's like a highway.

100
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,279
Dude, this is amazing.

101
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,579
I'm doing the front, I'm doing the front.

102
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,939
I'm filling it in.

103
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,250
Okay, so the front is where?

104
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,250
Where the keys are.

105
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,250
That's what I'm doing, I'm working on that right now.

106
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,250
Wait, what? It's down here? Why is this piano long?

107
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,250
They're supposed to be wider than they are long.

108
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,490
This is a different kind of piano, it's like different.

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
This is like a Mack truck piano.

110
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,620
Alright, as long as, remember the butt comes up.

111
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Come on, why do we have to make it this long?

112
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
You said a giant piano.

113
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,050
I know, it's all my own fault.

114
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,050
Which one's the front?

115
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,050
Yeah, I'm at the front right now.

116
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,480
You're at the front?

117
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,230
Pianos are wider.

118
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,410
This is just long.

119
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,779
What the hell do keys look like?

120
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,779
Just like two or three blocks long.

121
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,980
Is this working?

122
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
No.

123
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Does this piano have like four keys?

124
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
I have like four keys.

125
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
Oh, do you want me to play you a song?

126
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Sorry, I can only play hot cross buns.

127
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Yeah, you can only play the first part of Chopsticks.

128
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,870
So what should be the black keys?

129
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,870
Oh, this is just huge.

130
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,870
I don't know. Spoon help.

131
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,050
What, spoon, what, who, for what?

132
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,670
You gotta close the gap.

133
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,939
Actually, it doesn't really look that bad.

134
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,939
No, it does.

135
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,579
Yeah, don't criticize your own work, are you kidding me?

136
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:08,810
You know how hard we worked on this thing?

137
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,459
Alright, the keys really do need to be

138
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,459
a little bit better than that.

139
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,459
There need to be more of them.

140
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,589
No, it's just, it's fine.

141
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,589
You put them at the wrong end.

142
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:26,339
Hold on, we can widen it a little bit.

143
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,579
Dude, we'd have a better chance of like

144
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,579
just turning this into a guitar right now

145
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,579
than just finishing it at the piano.

146
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,579
It's gonna be a giant guitar.

147
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,860
It just looks like a giant thing with big teeth.

148
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,139
Like a big monster.

149
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,579
It looks like Tetris.

150
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,750
So we gotta do one of these episodes

151
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,750
saying, we're not telling them what it is

152
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
and we just make it and people have to guess

153
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
what it is.

154
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,750
That's actually a pretty good idea.

155
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,750
Let's start with this one. Just bleep out the word.

156
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,139
Every time somebody says the word piano, I'll bleep it.

157
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,509
I'll just put like a sensor.

158
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,509
Hey guys, this is pretty funny.

159
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,509
Just do that. It works.

160
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,509
Alright, five minutes have gone by.

161
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,970
We gotta close this out.

162
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,970
It works. Alright, look at this.

163
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,829
This is beautiful.

164
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,829
Good thing I made it so the keys come out

165
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,829
way too far.

166
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,420
What is this?

167
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,449
It's all good. This is great.

168
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,819
This is fantastic.

169
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,220
We're gonna sell this for so much.

170
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
I don't even know what to think right now.

171
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Just for reference, we said the piano is huge.

172
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
The piano is actually

173
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
bigger than this person.

174
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,029
It's about as big as a house.

175
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,459
A nice piano house.

176
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,459
That being said for how big it is,

177
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,459
it has a surprising

178
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,459
very small amount of

179
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,670
keys.

180
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,670
What is the rest of this piano for?

181
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,100
Why is it so big if it has no purpose?

182
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
It's a house.

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,660
You can live in the piano

184
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,180
and you can also tickle me.

185
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,430
Alright, so we are allowed to do

186
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,120
that spoon apparently.

187
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
How much time?

188
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,680
We have like 40 seconds.

189
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Is there any detailed work we can do

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,679
with this thing?

191
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,679
Absolutely not. It's ruined.

192
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,230
This has to come out like this.

193
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,230
This is one of those games where you stand up

194
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,600
and play it. You got no chair.

195
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
This is one of those pianos where you drink like an elixir

196
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
and you grow 50 feet tall and then you play it.

197
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,419
Look at that grand piano.

198
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm making a quick chair.

199
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,789
It's not making towers.

200
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:01,830
It's a chair.

201
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,830
I don't like this very much.

202
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,460
This has to go. 10 seconds.

203
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,700
Stop ruining my work.

204
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
5, 4, 3, 2,

205
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,870
1, and get the chair done!

206
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,870
And there it is. Nice.

207
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,559
And that's it. Grand piano.

208
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,799
That's the chair balancing.

209
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,980
What human being

210
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
sits on this chair

211
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
like this small?

212
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
This is not even room for one butt cheek for apparently

213
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
who's big enough to touch this keyboard.

214
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,659
You made the chair too big.

215
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,659
And that is going to wrap up the video.

216
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,659
So thank you guys so much for watching.

217
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,659
Leave a comment with the name and the rating for this thing.

218
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,659
It looks pretty much like a piano.

219
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,659
I don't know, you guys can be the judge of that one.

220
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,659
But I'll see you guys all soon

221
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,659
and take care everybody.
