00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:13,419
Morning, how you doing? Remember the golden rule of this channel. If one minute has gone by and

2
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:22,280
Jerma does not say something, he's dead. It's a golden rule here. A full minute has passed,

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:32,409
he has not spoken. He's dead. He had to have died. It's true. Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome

4
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:40,579
to the stream. We're gonna do DLC movie night part two. We have well over a hundred plus more

5
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,100
videos to watch. Told you last weekend we were going to do it exactly one full week from,

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:56,310
you know, there. Here we are. I have to apologize because of yesterday. Those of you that were

7
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:05,379
watching the stream yesterday, the power went out and I didn't come back for a pretty long fucking

8
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:12,730
time. So sorry about the power going out and I couldn't even reply to you guys. I couldn't even

9
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:19,450
get in there because it killed my, uh, obviously killed my modem and my router. So I was just on

10
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,439
data, like just phone data. And when the power goes out somewhere, it kills everybody's router.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,280
So every single person in this entire area, all at the same time, switched to data mode

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,700
and called somebody. So I'm trying to like get in line in like the data queue at the tower

13
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,659
and I'm trying to tell you guys, Hey, the power, I don't even know if it went through.

14
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:53,959
It's like when you land in an airplane and you land and everybody ding. Okay. Every fucking phone

15
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,590
comes up in the seat. The second you land and it's like, wait, why do I have no service?

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,590
No, I'm trying to get through. Can you hear me? Hello? Okay. Times that by like 50,000.

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:18,629
That's not how it works. It is in my head. So that's what it is. Hmm. Never thought about it

18
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:25,189
like that. Yeah. As you still have to connect to something. So do you know how the infrastructure

19
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,680
works used? It doesn't, it's not a magic trick. You have to connect to the tower.

20
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,330
And if you, if like 10,000 connections go to the same time to the tower, you get, sorry,

21
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:50,889
you don't get to go. You get a call drop. You get the five G. What about five G? Yeah. Who knows?

22
00:02:50,889 --> 00:03:07,139
Maybe five G will solve this problem. Frog damp moment. All right. Frog damp moment. Apparently.

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:16,180
Hold on. Let me show it. Yeah. I'm, we're going to stall a little bit because I want people to get

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
in here because people want to watch this stuff. I'm not going to be like, Hey guys, welcome to

25
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,740
stream. Oh, video. No, we're going to wait. You got to wait like a minute or two, five minutes.

26
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:41,819
Hurry up. It's, it would just, I just know you hurry up and sit down. You hurry up and sit down

27
00:03:41,819 --> 00:04:01,370
for a little bit. And that like a peasant NPC. It really is. It sucks how much of a peasant NPC

28
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:15,349
this is. Can you get an emote? No, it already is an emote. You just jump scared.

29
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,629
All right. I'm going to move. Well, okay. Are you ready? It's been five minutes.

30
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:30,459
Am I going to play custom robo again? This probably, I feel like we were just starting

31
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,079
to get into it. The worst part about when your power goes out, this is the worst thing about

32
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:42,899
power going out. You do it. You think that your house may have exploded, right? So you're just

33
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:49,459
sitting there. I was mid sentence. I got monitors on. I got an AC running and all of a sudden,

34
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,740
like a light is on and you just, Oh yeah. What happened to my dad? Did something explode? No.

35
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,250
Okay. What happened? Oh, the power's gone. It's when you don't, and this is when nothing happened

36
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,009
at all. Oh wait, there's a big snowstorm. Oh, tons of rain. Something must have, oh weather. No.

37
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:21,779
You're just sitting around and nothing, there's nothing wrong. Okay. Yes. Every power outage is

38
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:33,779
personalized. Yeah. It was weird. And then you get, you start freaking out because it starts turning

39
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,579
back on and off and on and off over and over again. And then you run around like a psychopath

40
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,100
unplugging everything in your whole house. Oh fuck.

41
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,860
Fuck. I got to plug that thing. I was like, that thing's toast. And then I, I smell something. I

42
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:03,129
something's burning. I smell electricity. Like you're fine. I go and unplug everything. What's

43
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:10,490
the matter with them? That that's a power going on and off. And then you start smelling electricity.

44
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,670
Yeah. I freak out as I don't even like to use the oven. I think the oven's scary.

45
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,949
Are you really this surprised that I don't like power outages?

46
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,959
I'm like a small dog in personality. Do I know what it is? Cool. I love it.

47
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Does something startle me? Do you, did you walk into the house with my favorite toy and costume?

48
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,680
Did you walk into the house with a Gumby outfit on and you're going to freak me out?

49
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:50,410
Anyways, let's watch the movie. The literal man child. No, I'm a little dog child. I'm a man dog.

50
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:56,230
I'm a dog man, but not in the sense that you like not, oh, he's like a furry. No, no, no. I'm just,

51
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:07,269
I'm a dog man. I have the dog brain. There you go. No, I'm not a dog. I'm not an anthropomorphic dog.

52
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:30,199
I am a person with a dog's brain. Clarify that. Okay. You ready? Here we go. Free. This is called,

53
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:57,750
this is the germ-tastic voyage. Ready? Let's go. What? The plan is one shrink ray,

54
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:18,300
go to the heart, kill the virus and extract. Holy shit. That was loud. Oh, my butthole. All right.

55
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:26,250
Okay. This is the Osmosis Jones.

56
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,019
Yeah.

57
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:10,039
All right. I just took like a big, hold on. I just took a big gulp. I just, I just took a

58
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:17,129
full sip of water and like laughed internally and just almost exploded my head. I almost just did

59
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:27,370
what happened in the video when it happened in the video. Look at the painting. Look at the,

60
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,029
all right. I'll go over this really quickly. I'm going to go over this very quickly.

61
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:40,389
I don't know how real this, look, this could be real. I don't know. But apparently this is the

62
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,100
Chuck E. Cheese stock price the day that I streamed and Chuck E. Cheese came in.

63
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:57,460
This is apparently real. I don't, I have nothing to do with this. I don't know. I don't, look,

64
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:15,240
I didn't ask for this. Coming up next is average life of car germa.

65
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:43,450
Is good. Only a few of these left in existence. I'm certain of that and I'm giving it to you.

66
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:52,279
That's right. Take it. It's yours. Don't sell it though. I don't know.

67
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,220
Hi. Hi. Hello. Yes. How are you? Black screen. Shut up. Shut up. Is this supposed to be a video?

68
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,460
This is ridiculous. You catch up to it's like this every single day. And I'm sick and tired of

69
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,259
hearing. Do you want, I don't know. Do you want it here? I can hear you all the way up here.

70
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:28,940
Take it. And I pay rent too. Take it. Take this. Take this from me. Take this from me. Take this

71
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,419
from me right now. Take it from me. Take it from me dude. I don't want to fucking hold it anymore.

72
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:43,690
Okay. That was just, I was odd. I could describe that one as odd.

73
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,440
First of all, we had 10 community subs from Minty Fox and 10 from hallowed guru.

74
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:06,759
Thanks both of you. Would the subs, 10 subs each. Welcome to the sub crew. Thanks guys.

75
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:14,889
Really appreciate it. Half life streamer. This is for the sub crew. YouTuber. Hey,

76
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:21,580
you're part of the sub crew now. That's right. You paid me $5. Now you're part of

77
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,750
an exclusive club. Oh, the other people that don't pay the $5. This is not allowed in.

78
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:54,649
No, no boys allowed. Damn it. It's like,

79
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:19,750
I'd like to report a accident. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, three.

80
00:14:24,009 --> 00:15:07,980
Here we get invaded while playing dark souls. Oh, the Twitch watcher. What am I drinking? That is

81
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,779
water with a little bit of lemon. It just gives it just enough to a little bit of a kick.

82
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,049
Stay right there. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?

83
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:48,820
Did I just get stream sniped? That was amazing.

84
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,379
This is, wait, this is before we even had the Chuck E cheese arc on the channel.

85
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:08,440
Remember ruins my fit for, I want to watch that one again. At least from here. A little bit of

86
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:19,740
lemon. It just gives it just enough to a little bit of a kick. The best part is when you edited my

87
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:26,549
head going all the way backwards, I can't even see the game. Don't do it.

88
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:40,389
Don't please stay right there. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?

89
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:54,789
Did I just get stream sniped? Uh, yes. The answer is always yes. Why even ask that question? All

90
00:16:54,789 --> 00:17:02,740
right. Derma ruins my birthday. Oh, we stuck here forever. All right. Derma ruins my fifth birthday

91
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:15,180
and loses his job.

92
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,529
I'm not a real dinosaur.

93
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,549
Oh, please put it in. Did you get put, did you put big birthday in here?

94
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:33,829
Do it fucking right. Oh my God. So bad. Die you motherfucker.

95
00:18:41,589 --> 00:19:01,160
Stupid ass. So I appreciate. All right. I appreciate the, um, I appreciate that I'm only 500 pounds

96
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:12,059
thing. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? What just, what just popped up over there?

97
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:42,789
What was that trying to capture? A real ghost on camera. Wait, did that not pop up for you?

98
00:19:52,039 --> 00:20:19,210
Okay. Okay. Uh, that was the ghost. I have no idea. All right. Anyways, what was I going to say?

99
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:28,099
Who cares? I don't know what the fuck I was going to say. Let's go. This is Derma's Europe trip.

100
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,400
This is, this is Russia. Like I'm, I'm not going to Russia. Like I'm not going to go to Russia.

101
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,980
We're going to start here. Plane's going to come in. It's going to go like, this is a different

102
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,430
color for the plane, right? Like it's yellow. Here's where the plane comes in. This is Spain.

103
00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:01,019
Wrapping around into England. We stop on England. I'm going to say we stop in London for like a

104
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:12,220
couple of days. Hey everybody. Guess where I am. Hey mom. Mom, I see it. Yeah. Wow.

105
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,920
And then on the way out of London, we get up Greece. Greece is right there. Here's the worst

106
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,319
part. I don't know where any of these places, what any of these places are. I don't even care

107
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,579
if I win. She's the Russian colors. Wrap around to Italy, come down to Italy all the way to the

108
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,740
bottom of the boot. But I want to see, I want to see the bottom of the boot. You know what I mean?

109
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,740
I want to piss off the bottom of the boot.

110
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,529
One earbud left only.

111
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,569
Still going to be, we're going to be the bottom of the boot in Italy for like at least a week.

112
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:07,829
So we got like two days. We got one W here, one week, all the way wrapping around into,

113
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,829
this is Lithuania here. I want to go to Lithuania for like at least a month. I want to spend

114
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:24,329
some time there, want to learn the color, learn the language, I guess. I was trying to say learn

115
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:48,099
the culture. Stupid. That could have been TOS. I have no idea what they said. All the way up to,

116
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:53,099
uh, I mean I have some ancestry. So I mean Ireland is a good place to stop.

117
00:22:53,819 --> 00:23:01,460
And I'm going to stop in Ireland for maybe like a couple of days, like maybe two days.

118
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:11,480
Wow. He's shooting arrows. That's cool. Are there archers up there?

119
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,619
No, the main channel's not dead. It's in a museum.

120
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:32,619
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's crap, aren't you? You haven't seen me in a while,

121
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,980
but you know what? Fuck you.

122
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,500
FPK's coming back next weekend, by the way. Those of you that want to join in.

123
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,970
Looks pretty dire for Jerma as well. Looks like he may have at least one broken bone here,

124
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,130
as the EMT is going to pick him up and get him on that journey. Is this my thoughts?

125
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,650
And then we're going to go, we're going to take off. So here we go. Like we take off from Ireland

126
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,740
up to here. And here is Iceland. And we're going to, this is going to be blue because it's cold.

127
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,660
Arming. Stopping Iceland. Arming.

128
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:38,339
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

129
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,779
This is going to be a single player. Let's play. You know, I'm going to piss off,

130
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,779
I'm going to piss off the ice and I piss off the edge and then come all the way back around.

131
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:48,019
Of course, go all the way back around to America, which is over this way.

132
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,619
Back to America, flying over Russia.

133
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:02,359
I have a comment on this. That's my trip that I'm going to take.

134
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,900
I have a quick comment. I thought for some reason, I don't know why, don't ask me. I get it,

135
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:18,309
right? I know what this is for, but I for some reason thought that this was them censoring out

136
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:25,750
me having a huge, huge elephant. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode off the edge.

137
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:33,450
You know what I'm saying? I was like, holy shit, dude. I'm like, this is not P. This is so like,

138
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:43,480
what the hell are you implying here? This is P. I get it. P coming down the edge and then come all

139
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,599
the way back around. Of course, go all the way back around to America, which is over this way.

140
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,119
Such good sports back to America, flying over Russia.

141
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,859
And that's, that's my trip that I'm going to take.

142
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,130
All right. Dermot deserves a family of wild animals.

143
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:37,750
What the fuck? Holy shit, dude. This is by far, this is the best part right here.

144
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,599
You got something to say?

145
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:58,039
Dermot gets rejected on The Bachelorette. This man doesn't see it coming. He's going to

146
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:14,089
feel so blindsided. It makes me feel so terrible. Oh fuck. Oh man. This is like spilled water on

147
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:30,700
myself. This is not even. Hi. Hey. Very nice. Incredible. And I'm giving it to you. That's

148
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:38,440
right. Take it. Take this from me right now. Take it from me. Take it from me, dude. I don't want to

149
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,640
fucking hold it anymore. Take it from me. Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak

150
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:49,400
out. There's just one piece with somebody else that I am not ready to say goodbye to yet.

151
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:14,420
I think that there's just a better fit for us. Awesome. Oh, yes. A baseball one.

152
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:25,180
I can't wait to hit like two home runs. The unfortunate Jermariner's game. Jermariner's.

153
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:39,299
This is not a baseball one. I'm not hitting a grand slam. What is this? This is bullshit.

154
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:51,400
Why are they going so far? He's catching his own ball?

155
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,819
It's out of the park.

156
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,819
Picture. Oh boy.

157
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,339
The fuck is going on? Are they on different teams?

158
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:57,019
Yes.

159
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,119
Quit.

160
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:15,259
Oh shit. It's coming real fast. Yeah. Funny.

161
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:38,789
Holy shit. That was absolutely insane. I need like a minute just to process the last one.

162
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:49,849
So there's three teams. Team one was the white and then gray and then red. There was only two to

163
00:30:49,849 --> 00:31:00,380
know it was the umpire. Okay. That was not. One was the ref. Can't wait to do the baseball stream.

164
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:08,579
It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait. You like my hair today? It's funny you mentioned that

165
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:16,019
because I sat down here like an hour ago and I had mustache hair. So I was like, how the,

166
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:22,099
I can't get to ever do what I wanted to. So I wet my hair and just buried the comb in and just went

167
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,539
over, over, over, over, over. And then I sat down and went, okay, that looks okay.

168
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:31,640
In about an hour, remember this, in like an hour or two, all roads lead back to mustache hair.

169
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,640
As you see, it's already forming. You see that? Do you see it forming already?

170
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:41,799
All roads lead to mustache hair. All. I'll check back in a little bit and we'll see.

171
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,619
This is uh, German goes to the mayor.

172
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:59,160
Excuse me. German nine eight is here. Okay. Let's see what we have here. Mayor. Michael.

173
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:17,670
So Michael, can you tell me you're a doctor of energy now? Yeah, it's a great gig and you are

174
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,029
not going to believe the car they just gave me. Not a LeBaron. Oh, watch the show by the way.

175
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,910
I mean, you probably have no idea what the fuck's going on, but I think that's

176
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:45,079
okay. So what the hell is this? So Tom goes to the mayor is the Tim and Eric's

177
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:51,799
first real show that they really had on TV. It's worth watching.

178
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,799
They had a lot of just random celebrity guests that would just show up. It was pretty cool.

179
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,259
It was really fun. All right. What is this? What is this? But German escaped.

180
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,819
Oh, now everybody online say that this is the best thing.

181
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,619
This better be transformative or I'm going to be upset about this.

182
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:11,099
It definitely feels gentle. I definitely can't wait to get home and use the lawnmower.

183
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:48,890
Is this an ad? Did we have to see this one? Oh, skip it. What? Wait, what? Why were the beginning?

184
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:56,500
Hold on. How did I get to the beginning of the playlist? What button did I press? What did I do?

185
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:05,640
What did I do? Did I press like, did I freak out and press like the start over button?

186
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:29,300
All right. We're good. We're good. Hold on. Where are we? I think that video was removed from the

187
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:47,579
playlist when I clicked on it. It's not here anymore. I'll prove it. Ready? This is germ goes

188
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:53,849
to the mayor. Okay. You ready? Germ goes to the mayor. What's right after germ goes to the mayor?

189
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:20,070
You know, all right. Anyways, I got yoinked. Oh my God. It never happened. It never existed.

190
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:28,630
Weird. All right. Well, anyways, it's lost media. This is the germ saw killer, a German 95 green

191
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:38,940
screen thriller. Okay. Here comes like probably the entire first movie trailer or three trailer.

192
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,019
I don't know. It's probably the whole entire movie. Here comes saw spoilers. Be aware. Be aware.

193
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:48,599
And I know what one there's like 10 of them at this point. Like it's like saying in the

194
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,389
Jason movies that Jason kills people. There's been like 10 of those two. Is that a spoiler

195
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:58,869
saying that like, Oh, Jason Voorhees is Mr. Voorhees and he kills people at the camp.

196
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:03,829
He does that in every movie. Guess what? And saw he's going to like carve up somebody's head.

197
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,119
He's going to like stuff. Somebody's brain full of like a, uh, and either brain and shit. I don't

198
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:27,159
know. Let's go. You remember what's going on with this crap. What are you? I was just kidding. Look,

199
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:47,860
finally. What is this?

200
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:23,099
Absolutely acceptable. Good question. We've just tried to get the key out of your ass.

201
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,579
What have your sternum or your eye, whatever I decided to put it?

202
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,730
No, no, no. I actually, that was me. This is a dream. This is a dream. A dream.

203
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,489
Make your choice. Make your choice.

204
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:53,059
You sick fuck. Oh yeah. Like, uh, five wires. That's what it is. What the fuck?

205
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,539
Yeah, whatever. Just put it on the top. Oh, what are you, uh, you're ordering food. Okay.

206
00:37:58,579 --> 00:37:59,460
Can you get me some food?

207
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,809
How am I supposed to get a key out of my stomach? You don't even give me anything.

208
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:10,969
What am I supposed to do with my hands?

209
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,380
Woot. Yeah. It was the most work I've ever done in my life.

210
00:38:54,679 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh no. Okay. Oh, just right there. Just right there.

211
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,119
You ran and ran and as his legs grew, he glided over the desert earth.

212
00:39:28,840 --> 00:40:03,960
Oh, I feel like somebody like ordered this. Don't you feel like somebody ordered this?

213
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,039
Fulfilling an order. My order. So please hand them over. Thank you. Goodbye.

214
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,610
That was very, very good. I'm so glad somebody did this. I did like 40 minutes of soft footage

215
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:38,519
and use once. I'm going to be really, really sad if this is the only soft footage that we get.

216
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:46,809
I spent a good 40 minutes doing it. And Hey, even if, if this is the only one worth it,

217
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:53,110
worth it. It's worth it. Uh, German's unusual hobby.

218
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:46,039
Is this some kind of sick joke? Kiss my ass. That's a pretty good, pretty good view.

219
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:54,039
I don't know what this is. I'm just going with it. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

220
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,599
I feel like I'm a baby in a car scene.

221
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:12,789
Okay. That was interesting. Uh, this is Germoyal versus the Death Eaters.

222
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:18,489
I can already see that. Okay. I would have lost the Where's Waldo initially.

223
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:21,929
You know, something is so obvious, but you just have no idea that it's there.

224
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:31,880
This was not here in my brain. Here comes spoilers. Yes, this is going to be Harry Potter spoilers.

225
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,210
If you've never seen Harry Potter. Oh, by the way, the rules have been updated

226
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:44,139
for green screen footage that I'm going to show on this stream. Here comes Harry Potter,

227
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:51,980
something late game Harry Potter, by the way. I'm, I'm assuming because they're not eight,

228
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,139
right? That's how you tell when you're going to get a real deep Harry Potter spoiler.

229
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:03,059
How old is he? Okay. He's like, he's like 18 or 19 in this picture. That's deep,

230
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:22,199
late game Harry Potter spoilers. I've had all the essentials packed for days.

231
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:26,599
Just in case. By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

232
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,449
Harry, hurry.

233
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,989
I just, I just hit him right in the skull. I just cracked his skull.

234
00:43:53,849 --> 00:44:00,539
Oh no, my cloak. Quick, into the castle. Get the lights.

235
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,920
He was on the astronomy tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

236
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,679
This is dollar hop. I reckon this is for the water posters. Disgusting.

237
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,969
So what are we going to do with you, eh? Kill us if we turn around, won't you?

238
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:31,050
We killed them the moment we were here. Harry, Harry, it's time.

239
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,369
Give me some leverage here. How would you feel then?

240
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,130
Thank you. On the count of three. It's better we wipe their memories.

241
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,210
One. You're the boss.

242
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,929
Two. Three.

243
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,130
You're the best of spells. What am I even doing here?

244
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,820
It's G to five. I'm not even here. Other words they say.

245
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:11,269
Oh my God. Damn it. My fucking head hurts. I hit him in his skull. Oh, okay.

246
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:27,559
This is German on the run. FMV game parody. Water out of the toilet.

247
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:37,579
After a long day of work, Yereminin85 tried to rest a bit. When suddenly.

248
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:04,869
Delete.

249
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:33,320
Uh oh. I thought my computer crashed. This is my actual background.

250
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:51,059
I thought that everything crashed. That was crazy. Wait, it's round two. All right.

251
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:59,050
You got to get it right this time though. The giant enemy.

252
00:46:59,050 --> 00:46:59,769
Russian German.

253
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:07,539
The giant enemy. Russian German.

254
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:25,019
What's even going on? We haven't seen very many Russian German either.

255
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:37,750
I did that for a while. All right. Come on. Come on. Oh wow.

256
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,530
I don't want to hear any. All right. This is German.

257
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,179
The German family goes to McDonald's. Another McDonald's one.

258
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,539
This is a, this is a long one. Let's see.

259
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,920
And I don't want to hear any. Hey, I want to go to McDonald's.

260
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,619
I want to go to McDonald's. I want to go to Wendy's too.

261
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,940
Buckle up. Mom, I want to go to both.

262
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,670
Mom, McDonald's. Shit, nice smoothie.

263
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,710
Nice smoothie. Shit.

264
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,289
Only McDonald's. We're a McDonald's family for Christ's sake.

265
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:30,599
We only eat McDonald's. Dad, Jimmy, and mom.

266
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:47,769
Wait, why are we changing cars?

267
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,820
Why are there so many of us?

268
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:34,679
Sunny day outside. Safe to me.

269
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:43,099
I'm full. And I don't want to hear anybody talking.

270
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,360
Go ahead and get out of the way. Leave your dear old dad here.

271
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:55,699
Let me just relax. Nice smoothie.

272
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,980
Nice and smooth. Smooth.

273
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:11,619
I know. I love left-hand turns. Maybe I should try going right.

274
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,380
But I can't. I've always gone left.

275
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:18,710
I was going a big square. I can't.

276
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,429
Okay, this time, this time, you can do it. You can go right.

277
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:26,730
Hey, fellas, I'm going to go right.

278
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:49,579
Are they okay? I think I'm the Superman.

279
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,110
You okay? Hey, you all right in there?

280
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:11,050
Hello, who's this? Yes, yeah, I'd like to report an accident.

281
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:18,090
Sorry. Yeah, I'm on 12345678910th Street.

282
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,739
I punched a car and it crushed me. I think I'm at a supercar accident.

283
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:32,260
No, don't tell the government about that.

284
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,559
That was really unfunny. I really wish I knew how to delete things off that thing.

285
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:50,760
That was terrible. Don't use that. Don't use any of that.

286
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,679
Don't even bother. Is this another actor?

287
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,840
Was that an actor? A self-insert?

288
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:10,940
Was it? Oh, come on.

289
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,860
What did I say? Rule? What was rule one?

290
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,989
What was the number one rule? I said it earlier.

291
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:19,590
What was it? I don't remember what the number one rule is.

292
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,349
I said it like an hour ago. What is it?

293
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:26,519
You didn't say? Yeah, I talked about like the rule.

294
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah, okay. No, no.

295
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,219
You actually didn't say what the number one rule was.

296
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:39,610
I did. I talked about the number one thing.

297
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,949
All right. Well, the number two thing is,

298
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:47,739
you're not allowed to be a better actor than me on my own stream.

299
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:49,739
You said there are new rules. Oh, right.

300
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:53,110
Okay. Well, rule two, you're not allowed to be a better actor than me.

301
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,769
Since its inception, hundreds of TV...

302
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:59,530
Okay, this is the Adventures of Cartwheel, Germa, and Orange Froglodyte.

303
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,349
Mystery of the Fun Fair. Wait.

304
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,639
Is this a spin-off or is this a copy of the show?

305
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,420
Germa and Purple Alien. This is a spin-off.

306
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:17,780
Cartwheel, Germa, and Orange Froglodyte.

307
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,219
This is a fine fighting duo against a briefly athletic man named Kaden.

308
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:23,460
This was canned so badly by the critics.

309
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,780
It's a Purple Alien spin-off.

310
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,420
It is. What is it? The same guy?

311
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:44,940
Pog. Did that person stem a new genre?

312
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:17,449
They couldn't talk.

313
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,030
Fuck.

314
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:31,500
Unfair time.

315
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:48,840
God damn it.

316
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:01,880
Watch out.

317
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,179
Gamer. The Mega Prize.

318
00:55:44,340 --> 00:56:04,539
Be continued after these messages.

319
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:05,469
Uh oh.

320
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:16,739
It was actually... Okay.

321
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,619
We should watch the whole thing apparently.

322
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:21,079
Part two.

323
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,619
Mystery of the Fun Fair.

324
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:27,780
Let's just play an ad.

325
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:35,909
What is it? No more sequels.

326
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:37,190
No more sequels.

327
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,429
We want remakes.

328
00:56:40,389 --> 00:56:45,590
I want a remake of Germa...

329
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,869
Germa is short.

330
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:47,750
He's 5'2".

331
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:12,420
It's too many.

332
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:16,840
Uh oh. You fucked with the toy.

333
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,210
Nice.

334
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:33,500
We're gonna get a final battle?

335
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:54,670
No.

336
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:59,539
But he got away.

337
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:01,059
That's not good. That has to be a part three.

338
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,519
It's up in the event.

339
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:32,150
Is it the end?

340
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,110
After credit scene.

341
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:33,610
Has to be.

342
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:47,880
But wait a minute.

343
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,559
What? But the villain got away with it.

344
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:50,440
It's gonna be a part three.

345
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:51,880
It'll be a sequel.

346
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:59,159
Man, I really can't wait for green Germa.

347
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,440
And crawling Germa.

348
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,780
That's gonna be great when we see that one.

349
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,579
Green Cucumber and crawling Germa.

350
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:30,329
I'm going to kill you.

351
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:46,489
No.

352
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:03,239
One, two, three, break it down.

353
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,239
Get busy.

354
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,949
Get busy.

355
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:10,949
Get busy.

356
01:02:10,949 --> 01:02:13,900
You think I can do that, didn't you?

357
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,900
You think I can do that, didn't you?

358
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,900
One, two, three, kick it.

359
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,059
One, two, three, kick it.

360
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:24,469
One, two, three, kick it.

361
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:26,429
What?

362
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:29,050
I'm sorry.

363
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:35,449
Following motion picture,

364
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,449
Yopla's topsy turvy

365
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,760
has been approved by someone without any authority to do so.

366
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,519
Whose resemblance to anyone living or dead is merely a coincidence.

367
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:50,360
It's supposed to be...

368
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,280
All right, here we go.

369
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,440
Yopla's topsy turvy.

370
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,320
Germa edition.

371
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,070
This is not...

372
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,949
It's topless.

373
01:02:57,949 --> 01:02:59,469
It's very clearly not a T.

374
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:04,650
Okay, that...

375
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,289
No, it's not like...

376
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:06,889
I don't have like boobs or anything.

377
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:07,369
It's all right.

378
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:07,869
Ready?

379
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,360
T-pants production.

380
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,650
What is he driving?

381
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,210
A chair?

382
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:19,769
Wait, what was that?

383
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:31,530
What the hell is happening in this video?

384
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,199
Your movie.

385
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:50,380
From the movies,

386
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,699
you did a shot-for-shot remake.

387
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:04,110
It's a shot-for-shot remake.

388
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,900
Sorry.

389
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,250
What do you want me to do so I put my arms on my sides?

390
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:43,530
Transformers.

391
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,730
Transform into...

392
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:45,690
Object of flight.

393
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,110
Ow!

394
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:49,710
Ow!

395
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:50,909
Ow!

396
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,969
My fucking bones!

397
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:53,469
Ow!

398
01:05:54,730 --> 01:06:01,900
We're not just psychoporate.

399
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:18,809
That's Baby Joker.

400
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:24,409
Okay.

401
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:26,329
I had no idea what was going on.

402
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,000
Until about a minute and 45 seconds ago.

403
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:37,070
Guys, I even thought that this person...

404
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:38,989
Oh, topless.

405
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,590
Yes, right.

406
01:06:41,389 --> 01:06:42,989
This is...

407
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:44,349
I made this movie.

408
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:46,030
How long ago was that, though?

409
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,550
If it was more than a year ago, it doesn't exist.

410
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,110
In my brain.

411
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,269
Like three, five years ago.

412
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:54,909
Well, yeah.

413
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:55,309
Oh, yeah.

414
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,360
Watch the original one.

415
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,630
All right.

416
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:02,909
Yeah, hold on.

417
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:03,869
Let's watch the original.

418
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:04,989
I'm actually curious about this.

419
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:16,639
Let's see how close...

420
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:17,440
How correct this was.

421
01:07:23,369 --> 01:07:24,329
Enjoy it.

422
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:26,039
Do it side by side.

423
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,260
I...

424
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,860
I'm not going to be able to cue that up.

425
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:37,320
All right.

426
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:37,639
Hold on.

427
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:38,119
Wait, wait, wait.

428
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:38,360
Let me...

429
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,219
I'll put them side by side.

430
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:42,300
All right.

431
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,619
Hold on.

432
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,500
I'll put them side by side.

433
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,719
Are they timed correctly, though?

434
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:47,199
The beginning?

435
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:49,130
Okay.

436
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:49,530
Hold on.

437
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:50,730
Let me get this right.

438
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,119
I'll put them side by side.

439
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,699
All right.

440
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:15,019
You know what?

441
01:08:15,019 --> 01:08:15,579
Let me do this.

442
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:17,979
It's not shot for shot.

443
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:18,939
Oh, it's not.

444
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:19,979
It's not shot for shot.

445
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,819
Oh, it's not shot for shot.

446
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:24,300
Okay.

447
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:24,619
All right.

448
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:24,939
All right.

449
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:25,180
All right.

450
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:25,340
All right.

451
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:25,819
We'll just watch...

452
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:26,699
We'll watch the original.

453
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:28,750
Oh, right.

454
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:28,909
Yeah.

455
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:34,250
It's not cued up correctly.

456
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:34,810
On your own...

457
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,609
On your own time.

458
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:36,890
All right.

459
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,289
Let's go.

460
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,720
Not shot for shot.

461
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,600
Oh, man.

462
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:49,880
I'm curious.

463
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,359
Let's watch it.

464
01:08:58,329 --> 01:08:59,210
Enjoy it.

465
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,640
When are you going to get the playlist?

466
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,600
After the...

467
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,720
At the end of their stream today.

468
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:00,970
Chair.

469
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:01,529
Okay.

470
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:02,409
I remember the chair.

471
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:41,869
That was accurate.

472
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:55,000
Dearly beloved,

473
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,079
we are gathered here today

474
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,949
to incorporate

475
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,310
our final testament to this man,

476
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,189
this wonderful man that lies before us.

477
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:08,670
His name was Harold Slunk

478
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,989
and he was my best friend.

479
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:15,689
And can somebody turn that fucking music off, please?

480
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:18,460
Thank you.

481
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,909
As I was saying,

482
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,430
Harold was a good friend of mine.

483
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:22,989
Lost my heart,

484
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:24,510
hope, and I a promise that's real.

485
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,350
And I'm just going to miss him so fucking much.

486
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,869
I'm going to miss him more than anything.

487
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,409
And by the way,

488
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,770
after this, I'll see you at Fridays for two set wings.

489
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,750
That was the joke.

490
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,510
This is fucking terrible.

491
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,430
This is the worst one ever.

492
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,069
It really kind of was.

493
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:53,079
That was the worst fucking one.

494
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,779
That was probably the worst one.

495
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,939
Moving on.

496
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,520
Because we do have a shitload more videos to watch.

497
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,770
Up next.

498
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:15,039
Irma says hello in the fight.

499
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,159
I don't know what the fight is.

500
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:20,079
Ever seen it?

501
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:20,479
Don't know.

502
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:30,460
Spoilers.

503
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,579
Spoilers with the fight.

504
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,699
Got it.

505
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:33,579
Spoilers with the fight.

506
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:02,939
I was scooped.

507
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,020
I was scooped.

508
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,739
I almost did.

509
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,680
Keying.

510
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,479
Turkey arms.

511
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,760
Balloon.

512
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,550
Fuck off.

513
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,600
Okay.

514
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:57,250
All right, so he won.

515
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:58,850
Is there more?

516
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,409
There's more.

517
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:00,130
I was 18.

518
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:04,449
I found myself in the high school dance.

519
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,170
Nervous for all of us.

520
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,470
Except on this particular day.

521
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:17,010
He didn't do anything.

522
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:23,729
That is, I believe what we just watched is

523
01:14:23,729 --> 01:14:25,090
shit, gotta make deadline.

524
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:27,010
Gotta hit export.

525
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,579
It was good though.

526
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,380
Yeah.

527
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,899
I'm really enjoying the school dance.

528
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:50,539
Should I come a little closer?

529
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,500
Wait, what am I doing?

530
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,670
Am I choking?

531
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,189
So do you have a math homework?

532
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,310
Do you have to do this one?

533
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:00,989
What the fuck are you doing?

534
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:06,020
Yeah, I have to do this because she's the worst.

535
01:15:10,899 --> 01:15:12,500
Entering the ring first.

536
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:18,300
We have the bad boy, Joey Jamila.

537
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,060
Wait, what is this?

538
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:27,460
This is another, wait, this is a bunch of actors.

539
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,260
This is all actors?

540
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:30,699
And his opponent.

541
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:32,689
Entering the ring.

542
01:15:32,689 --> 01:15:38,050
From Boston, Massachusetts, Jerma985.

543
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:43,250
You're the one I'm gonna get.

544
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,250
This is the versus the invisible man.

545
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,770
Okay, yes, yes, I know this.

546
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,210
I've seen this.

547
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:06,260
I didn't want to, I didn't want to knock this, but I did.

548
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:08,659
That's my little type.

549
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,140
You can't do this to me.

550
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,420
Ow, do you have any idea who I am?

551
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,659
Yeah, Jerma985, look me up.

552
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:20,779
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

553
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:49,789
Wait.

554
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:50,590
Joey Jamila.

555
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:54,430
Don't move.

556
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:56,930
It's hard, man.

557
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:00,930
He's up top.

558
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:06,609
Oh, he's rolled up.

559
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:16,220
And your winner, the challenger, Jerma985.

560
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,979
That's the song, that's the song.

561
01:17:17,979 --> 01:17:19,579
I don't believe in babies.

562
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:21,180
That's what babies do.

563
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,579
Oh, and Jerma, go for it, come on, cheap shots.

564
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:25,739
All right, put the camera, get this guy on the ring.

565
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,260
Oh my God.

566
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,899
Hold on, I want to see the roll up again.

567
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:30,699
Entering the.

568
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,640
That roll up is so good.

569
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,569
Oh, he's rolled up.

570
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:49,489
Babies do that.

571
01:17:49,489 --> 01:17:50,529
Okay, that was awesome.

572
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:55,680
Jerma sits down for dinner with his family.

573
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,789
We saw this already.

574
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,739
No, did we see this exact one?

575
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,279
I don't think we saw this one.

576
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:37,810
Okay, yeah, so what do we have tonight?

577
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:38,449
Look at that.

578
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:40,609
Delicious.

579
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:46,060
Potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy.

580
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:48,590
You've about done yourself.

581
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,600
You pass the salt.

582
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,619
Don't throw it over here.

583
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:00,380
What about just a sicko?

584
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:08,300
Okay, so how was your day, son?

585
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:16,979
Wow, in class.

586
01:19:17,949 --> 01:19:21,649
That's unbelievable, Susie.

587
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,640
My kids, my kids are the smartest, straight A's.

588
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,659
He's like, this is sad.

589
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:36,020
That's a little tough, I think, a little tough.

590
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,380
A little overdone, but it's still good.

591
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:44,050
This is scary and sad and horrible.

592
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:45,729
Well, my day was pretty interesting.

593
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:47,890
I got fired.

594
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:51,420
I can't even like watch it, it's so fucked up.

595
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:59,180
Yep, and then I got hired.

596
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:05,069
Oh my God.

597
01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:05,789
I had a company next door.

598
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:08,350
Just walked out, brought my briefcase in.

599
01:20:09,229 --> 01:20:10,909
This is the TLT guy, perfect.

600
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:11,869
Oh my God, I'm so happy.

601
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:29,460
Ah, hold on, I need to take a second.

602
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:29,939
That hurt.

603
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,779
Oh, that's like scared me.

604
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:39,899
Oh, we're not even halfway.

605
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:47,140
All right, all right, let's go again.

606
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,779
The timing was perfect on that too, by the way.

607
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:55,899
Like very stellar editing here.

608
01:20:55,899 --> 01:20:57,579
Well, my day was pretty interesting.

609
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,739
I got fired.

610
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:17,680
Yep, and then I got hired by the company next door.

611
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,159
Just walked out, brought my briefcase in.

612
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:22,800
This is the TLT guy, perfect.

613
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,239
Oh my God, I'm so happy.

614
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:44,590
What is this?

615
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:47,100
What is this?

616
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:49,100
What?

617
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,619
Oh, boy.

618
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:56,140
Oh no, so loud.

619
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,500
Shut up, shut up.

620
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,659
Get out, go back, back into the scene, come on.

621
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:11,100
So I heard, who's you got to fight today, son?

622
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:16,720
Okay.

623
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:21,100
Let me tell you something.

624
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,420
If you can do not do it diplomatically,

625
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,420
then you shouldn't be doing it at all.

626
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:29,859
We only eat McDonald's.

627
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,779
I want to go to McDonald's.

628
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:37,380
Gravy, potatoes, meat, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers.

629
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,260
Well, I mean, it's kind of insane.

630
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,500
I heard that you punched him.

631
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:43,699
Did you?

632
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:44,420
You punched him?

633
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,619
You punched him in the face?

634
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,539
My son doesn't do that.

635
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,539
Diplomacy only.

636
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,239
You know how much trouble I could get in?

637
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,760
I'm in the gosh darn.

638
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,319
I'm getting heated here.

639
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,140
My son, a United States representative.

640
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:09,229
I'm your dad.

641
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:10,670
I'm the representative, not you.

642
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:13,500
That would be strange now, wouldn't it?

643
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,939
You got to do things diplomatically.

644
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:16,380
Or you're grounded.

645
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,020
No, you know what?

646
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:18,939
I'll handle it.

647
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:20,460
You are grounded.

648
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,060
You're grounded.

649
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:23,979
We don't fight in this family.

650
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,949
Eat your gosh darn.

651
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:31,069
I keep saying that stuff and I don't want to.

652
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,939
Now listen, family.

653
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,220
If we could join hands.

654
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:43,810
No?

655
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,449
Okay.

656
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:59,020
Is that it?

657
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:00,930
Wait, what?

658
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:12,659
Somebody said, this is a scene you'd see at the Oscars for a nominee.

659
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,439
Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?

660
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:19,180
Happy birthday.

661
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,220
Oh, God.

662
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:24,779
All chairs turn.

663
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:29,279
I already know.

664
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:30,319
I've seen the whole video.

665
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:32,319
I don't even need to see it, but I'm still laughing about it.

666
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:37,760
Happy birthday to you.

667
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,640
Everybody, come on.

668
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:45,010
Happy birthday to you.

669
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:50,380
Happy birthday, dear.

670
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:59,100
Birthday.

671
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,170
God damn it, it was so close.

672
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,310
It was so close.

673
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:16,529
I was spooked.

674
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:18,619
I was spooked.

675
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:19,659
I almost did.

676
01:25:19,659 --> 01:25:31,939
This thing we have ever had on the show.

677
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:34,180
The blood is rushing through my entire body.

678
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:36,380
Who are you?

679
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:37,739
What's your name?

680
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:46,939
I think a collective, it was a whole performance.

681
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:48,939
It was like completely captivating.

682
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:50,699
I believed everything you were doing.

683
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:53,180
It was like, it was a real trance.

684
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,619
I'm so excited.

685
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:57,659
You have to be on my team.

686
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:03,020
Really important not to like discredit too is that you're a performer.

687
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,260
You're like, you're not just hiding behind anything.

688
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:08,699
Like you were moving, you were singing, you're a great vocalist.

689
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:13,310
Don't break my heart.

690
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,989
That'll be $200.

691
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:19,409
Holy shit.

692
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:22,140
Wait a minute.

693
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,979
What does this say at the top of the screen?

694
01:26:26,779 --> 01:26:28,380
Quick, German, green alien.

695
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,369
Wait, what?

696
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:36,159
No, wait, hold on a second.

697
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,710
I thought that was this German.

698
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:45,060
This is, wait, this is another one.

699
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,460
This is the one.

700
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,659
What am I just talking about this?

701
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:54,220
Shit dick.

702
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,180
Quick, German and green alien, right?

703
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,439
Bitch.

704
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:00,319
It's time to get punished.

705
01:27:01,819 --> 01:27:03,020
Oh, excuse me.

706
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,699
Why are there so many knockoffs?

707
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:06,380
Oh, excuse me.

708
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:06,859
Hold on.

709
01:27:06,859 --> 01:27:07,899
I have to diarrhea.

710
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:12,140
Kill him, kill him, kill.

711
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:13,979
Holy shit.

712
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:14,779
I can't believe it.

713
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:18,460
I did not see this list beforehand, guys.

714
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:18,939
I swear.

715
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:31,890
We got him.

716
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:34,369
Hey, hey, what's your opinion on politics?

717
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,199
I was doing something.

718
01:27:47,840 --> 01:28:06,510
The bootlegs are fighting each other.

719
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:07,069
Oh, no.

720
01:28:07,069 --> 01:28:13,869
I have to see a six-way tornado tag tournament

721
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:17,949
between all the green alien purple alien knockoffs.

722
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:24,210
Excuse me.

723
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:26,800
What's going on?

724
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,960
I just popped my pants.

725
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,260
Breaking news.

726
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,939
BDGerma is dead.

727
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,520
The sidekick red alien listed as missing.

728
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,869
How smelling green footprints have been discovered

729
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:52,909
near the crime scene.

730
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:58,000
The culprit is believed to be serial killer green alien.

731
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:01,199
Now on the FBI's most wanted list

732
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,279
for the murder of master Kit Fisto.

733
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:10,529
I just haven't get it right.

734
01:29:10,529 --> 01:29:13,420
I'm going to calm down and stab you in the fucking head.

735
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:16,739
Hey, shh.

736
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:17,300
Don't tell him.

737
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,020
Hey, don't tell him.

738
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:25,859
Why is everything shitting?

739
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:32,270
He's a Reddit user.

740
01:29:32,989 --> 01:29:34,590
Die, you motherfucker.

741
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:48,140
Is this candid?

742
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,260
I don't know, man.

743
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:49,899
Everyone quiet.

744
01:29:49,899 --> 01:29:54,300
This is soft footage.

745
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,380
Oh, you got me with the cliffhanger.

746
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,659
Good job with that cliffhanger.

747
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:58,300
Now I'm interested.

748
01:30:01,149 --> 01:30:02,590
Derma attacks the Death Star.

749
01:30:13,569 --> 01:30:14,289
Star Wars.

750
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:14,789
Yes.

751
01:30:16,289 --> 01:30:17,329
Red 3, standing by.

752
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,489
Where am I?

753
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,689
Red 11, standing by.

754
01:30:22,689 --> 01:30:23,970
Red 5, standing by.

755
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:27,329
Luck has bought us an attack position.

756
01:30:30,289 --> 01:30:34,050
We're passing through the magnetic field.

757
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:35,090
Hold tight.

758
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:37,409
Move your deflectors on double front.

759
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,640
He's going to come back and bite me.

760
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,239
Press the shutter at two.

761
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,659
Accelerate to speed.

762
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:58,340
Cross the axis and try and draw their fire.

763
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,399
I love left-hand turns.

764
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:07,140
It's the only thing I've said.

765
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:26,819
It's not going too good over here.

766
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:29,539
Maybe I should try going right.

767
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,060
I'm going to go right.

768
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:37,710
No, you can't even get.

769
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,579
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

770
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:45,149
Boogers.

771
01:31:45,149 --> 01:31:47,359
Pee break.

772
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:48,399
All right, we're going to take a pee break.

773
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:49,359
We'll come back.

774
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:53,949
Go take a pee break.

775
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:55,310
First pee break.

776
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:59,500
See you in two or three minutes.

777
01:32:00,060 --> 01:35:32,029
Okay, I have returned.

778
01:35:32,029 --> 01:35:33,310
Got some water.

779
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,579
I want to say thanks to Wink Dinker

780
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,949
for the five community subs

781
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:45,119
and Sunny J for the five community subs.

782
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:51,090
Wink Dink City, that's right.

783
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:53,550
Okay, coming up next.

784
01:35:54,689 --> 01:36:00,220
We have a, this is Uncut Gems.

785
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:02,479
I don't know if it's part of the trailer.

786
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:03,520
It might be part of the trailer.

787
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:03,840
I don't know.

788
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,039
I can't tell.

789
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:07,279
Or this could be a part of the movie.

790
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:09,520
This could be a very somewhere late game

791
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:11,600
or I don't know, mid game.

792
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,739
I don't know.

793
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:16,579
Or Uncut Gems.

794
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:20,189
So regardless, if you've never seen Uncut Gems

795
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:21,229
and you don't, even if you're like,

796
01:36:21,229 --> 01:36:21,789
no, fuck that.

797
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:23,390
And I want to see a single thing.

798
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,420
I'm back in about one minute.

799
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:31,890
Okay, here we go.

800
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:38,180
It's incoming in three, two, one.

801
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:42,270
Uncut Gems spoilers.

802
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,710
Get married with me now.

803
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:44,210
It's okay.

804
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:51,710
Oh, this fuck you got.

805
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,029
Do not let him in.

806
01:36:54,029 --> 01:36:55,149
Understand me?

807
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:56,270
Just ignore him.

808
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:57,310
Ignore him, Jodie.

809
01:36:57,949 --> 01:37:02,460
Okay, that was not, that was like from the trailer.

810
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,420
Okay, whatever.

811
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:03,979
But still.

812
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:15,649
Melonhead, thanks for the five subs.

813
01:37:15,649 --> 01:37:19,819
Okay, this is called I'm So Sorry.

814
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:23,579
And right off the bat, a mod, a mod in the chat.

815
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:28,449
Grump Clump just said, oh boy, this one.

816
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:29,090
Take a look at that.

817
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:31,329
One hour mustache hair.

818
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:31,970
I told you.

819
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:37,489
And eventually, this is going to keep parting

820
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,270
until it's complete mustache.

821
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:43,949
The definition starting to form on the, well, my left.

822
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,979
No, my right, your left.

823
01:37:48,979 --> 01:37:53,739
On your left, my right side, you'll see.

824
01:37:53,739 --> 01:37:57,140
Anyways, this one, apparently this I'm So Sorry.

825
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,380
And a mod said, oh no, this one.

826
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,579
Okay, well, that makes me scared.

827
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:01,140
Let's go.

828
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,859
Wait, did anybody even say that?

829
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,539
Did I just make that up?

830
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,539
Is he wearing underwear?

831
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:09,300
I think I just made that up, but yes, I am.

832
01:38:09,859 --> 01:38:32,100
Wait, did anybody even say that?

833
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:37,569
You edited out my pants.

834
01:38:37,569 --> 01:38:39,489
This is like a 3D model.

835
01:38:39,489 --> 01:38:41,569
It's like a Sims character in the mirror.

836
01:38:41,569 --> 01:38:46,460
Those aren't real feet.

837
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:55,789
How did he do it?

838
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:56,270
I don't know.

839
01:38:57,069 --> 01:38:57,550
I don't know.

840
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:00,430
Did he put it in front of a green screen?

841
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:05,539
He had to have made a 3D character or model or something.

842
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,340
He put it in front of a green screen and then cut it.

843
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,619
But no, this is not me.

844
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:16,180
It's the creator.

845
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:17,300
It's the editor's legs.

846
01:39:18,979 --> 01:39:23,060
So you're telling me the editor did a full frontal nude video

847
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,979
and then edited me on top of it?

848
01:39:29,939 --> 01:39:31,380
No, that's a 3D model.

849
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:32,420
You can clearly tell.

850
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,760
All right, let's go.

851
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,079
Coming up next is spoilers for American Psycho.

852
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:42,079
This is the movie spoiler stream

853
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,779
where we spoil every movie that's in your Netflix backlog.

854
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,850
Spoilers incoming for American Psycho.

855
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:54,880
Okay.

856
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,159
Three, two, one, go.

857
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:05,010
Where's the audio?

858
01:40:49,489 --> 01:40:50,130
Skeleton...

859
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:52,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

860
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:58,159
Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy for Jerma Rumble 2020.

861
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:13,840
You know what's fucking ridiculous about that picture?

862
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,680
Let's break this down real quick.

863
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:20,029
This was just thrown together over footage

864
01:41:20,029 --> 01:41:22,640
that was taken almost 10 years ago.

865
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:26,380
The ads that you see now look like this.

866
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:30,430
This stupid fucking thing pops up

867
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:31,630
on the top of your browser,

868
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:32,670
on the right of your browser,

869
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,109
on the left of your browser.

870
01:41:34,109 --> 01:41:36,909
We have come so far in technology.

871
01:41:36,909 --> 01:41:39,550
Why haven't the ads caught up, right?

872
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,109
Isn't that...

873
01:41:40,109 --> 01:41:41,310
I feel like that's a huge problem

874
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:43,310
why people don't want to fucking listen to a single ad.

875
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:45,869
Well, look at a single ad because they look like this.

876
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:51,329
It looked like they were made in paint in 10 seconds.

877
01:41:51,329 --> 01:41:58,619
That's stupid.

878
01:41:58,619 --> 01:41:59,100
You're right.

879
01:41:59,100 --> 01:41:59,420
What do you mean?

880
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,060
Am I being...

881
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,180
Wait, am I being disagreed with?

882
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:06,899
Wait, am I being disagreed with?

883
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,960
Oh, you don't have adblock.

884
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,460
LOL.

885
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,569
Yeah, but the reason why they were...

886
01:42:15,569 --> 01:42:17,810
The reason why adblock was invented in the first place

887
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:19,810
is because a banner would pop up

888
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:22,880
and it would be like somebody's dick

889
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,680
or it would be like some weird fucked up website

890
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,939
that you don't want to go to anymore.

891
01:42:27,939 --> 01:42:28,500
And you'd be like...

892
01:42:29,779 --> 01:42:31,300
When I say anymore, I mean like ever.

893
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:37,220
Okay, let's break that up so you don't want to...

894
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:39,619
Listen, ads were intrusive and...

895
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:42,260
I fucking can't.

896
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:48,819
Ads were intrusive.

897
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:51,060
They were annoying and they were ugly.

898
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:53,970
They were very ugly.

899
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:55,569
And now they may have even...

900
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:58,050
Some companies try to make ads look a little better

901
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:02,800
but they take up your whole screen, especially on mobile.

902
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,840
And you try to close the thing

903
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,359
and you keep scrolling it pops back up against...

904
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,039
No, just they've taken over the whole screen

905
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:12,720
not just annoyed some of it and put like gross weird stuff.

906
01:43:13,789 --> 01:43:14,750
All right, let's go.

907
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:16,029
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

908
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,060
Just use adblock.

909
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,819
But that was why adblock was invented.

910
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,340
It was because ads sucked in the first place.

911
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:22,380
What if ads didn't suck?

912
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:25,659
Why do you think I don't run ads on this channel?

913
01:43:25,659 --> 01:43:28,640
Because they're fucking annoying.

914
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,560
And I don't want to have you guys suffer

915
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,829
through the same like three ads 200 times.

916
01:43:34,829 --> 01:43:39,439
How many times do you guys want to watch the new

917
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:40,720
like Call of Duty trailer?

918
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,880
40 to 50 times?

919
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,569
I don't...

920
01:43:49,569 --> 01:43:50,369
I wouldn't want to do that.

921
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:53,710
Living above a spee nest.

922
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:54,189
Okay, let's go.

923
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:56,539
Let's go.

924
01:43:56,539 --> 01:43:57,039
Oh no.

925
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:01,939
Hi, hello.

926
01:44:01,939 --> 01:44:02,819
Yes, how are you?

927
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:04,279
Shut up.

928
01:44:05,659 --> 01:44:06,460
Shut up.

929
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:06,859
All of you.

930
01:44:06,859 --> 01:44:07,260
Let's go.

931
01:44:07,899 --> 01:44:09,279
It's ridiculous.

932
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:12,380
It's like this every single day.

933
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:14,539
And I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

934
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:19,260
I can hear you all the way up here.

935
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,300
And I pay rent too.

936
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:24,539
Unbelievable.

937
01:44:32,579 --> 01:44:34,819
Yes, my more slick hair.

938
01:44:34,819 --> 01:44:36,979
Here comes another Star Wars clip.

939
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:40,300
This is chat during green screen streams.

940
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,819
If you've never seen any of the Star Wars...

941
01:44:41,819 --> 01:44:42,300
Who cares?

942
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:44,380
I'll be honest.

943
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:47,489
It's not...

944
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:48,529
Don't worry, but it's all right.

945
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:51,329
All right, here we go.

946
01:44:51,329 --> 01:44:52,529
Chat during a green screen stream.

947
01:44:52,529 --> 01:44:53,810
This is going to be from either the...

948
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:54,529
One of the...

949
01:44:54,529 --> 01:44:56,850
The sequel series of Star Wars.

950
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:57,890
Be careful if you haven't seen it.

951
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:58,930
All of you have.

952
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:01,710
Three, two...

953
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:22,500
Wait, what was that?

954
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:26,739
What was that?

955
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:37,470
Dead.

956
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:38,909
Oh, I see.

957
01:45:38,909 --> 01:45:39,710
The bar was in the way.

958
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,770
Okay, wow.

959
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:45,979
Dermacraft gets a taunt kill.

960
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:48,420
Nice.

961
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,310
That's short and sweet.

962
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:56,420
Dermacraft gets interrupted by the Iron Giant.

963
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:58,500
Is this the Iron Giant?

964
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:03,489
Okay.

965
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,750
A lot of you after these streams are gonna...

966
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,109
You're gonna go to your Netflix

967
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:11,470
and you're just gonna start

968
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:13,550
getting stuff off of your watch list

969
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:15,729
and your wish list and stuff.

970
01:46:15,729 --> 01:46:18,210
You probably have like 10 to 15 shows and movies.

971
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:20,289
You're gonna go remove like four or five of them.

972
01:46:20,289 --> 01:46:26,029
This is huge spoilers for the Iron Giant.

973
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:27,710
Huge spoilers for the Iron Giant.

974
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:34,000
All right, we're...

975
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:53,920
We're second at the...

976
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,800
That was supposed to be me.

977
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:11,279
What is even going on?

978
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:21,939
I saw the...

979
01:47:21,939 --> 01:47:22,100
I...

980
01:47:25,819 --> 01:47:30,300
This is a great movie.

981
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:42,939
That was huge, Rula, by the way.

982
01:47:42,939 --> 01:47:43,500
That was enormous.

983
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,539
It was as big as the Iron Giant.

984
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:20,319
This made me love the Iron Giant character so much.

985
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:22,479
All right.

986
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:24,369
Good.

987
01:48:24,369 --> 01:48:26,579
Because this is what happened

988
01:48:26,579 --> 01:48:28,420
when Chuck E. Cheese was on the stream.

989
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:38,609
Thermo Jeopardy!

990
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,979
This is Jeopardy!

991
01:48:42,979 --> 01:48:54,829
It's gonna all be...

992
01:48:54,829 --> 01:48:55,949
Oh, Earl Bump is here.

993
01:48:55,949 --> 01:48:56,989
Finally got Earl Bump.

994
01:48:57,789 --> 01:49:08,340
Reuben Guy.

995
01:49:23,069 --> 01:49:23,550
Come on.

996
01:49:24,449 --> 01:49:25,010
Come on.

997
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:33,170
Celebration.

998
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:33,569
Thank you.

999
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:35,729
Wow, you won.

1000
01:49:35,729 --> 01:49:36,289
You did it.

1001
01:49:36,289 --> 01:49:37,170
You get to go up there.

1002
01:49:41,699 --> 01:49:42,659
God, that looks like fun.

1003
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,659
That looks like a lot of fun.

1004
01:49:44,659 --> 01:49:45,779
I wish I could get up there.

1005
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:52,079
Son of a bitch.

1006
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:56,739
After a while, Jeremy and Earl made it to the final Jeopardy.

1007
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,640
It cost us this much money to hire Louis Anderson.

1008
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,479
Bob, what is $3,200?

1009
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:06,239
Probably more than that.

1010
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:15,789
Wait, me?

1011
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:17,069
Wait, me?

1012
01:50:18,029 --> 01:50:18,989
I get it?

1013
01:50:18,989 --> 01:50:20,590
I get to go up there.

1014
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,710
No way.

1015
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:22,590
No way.

1016
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:23,229
Right here, man.

1017
01:50:24,029 --> 01:50:24,590
Fuck you.

1018
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:26,109
You gotta get a high five from me.

1019
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:27,229
Maybe I need one of these, though.

1020
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:31,310
What is one of these?

1021
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:31,869
No way.

1022
01:50:32,829 --> 01:50:35,310
Oh, yes.

1023
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:42,020
What's in the mystery box?

1024
01:50:42,739 --> 01:51:01,439
Hey, do you guys want to know something funny?

1025
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:09,869
Your cube video got claimed because of, I believe, that song or that clip that I fucking had to buy.

1026
01:51:14,289 --> 01:51:17,680
Like, I bought this.

1027
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,260
Like, I purchased this thing.

1028
01:51:19,819 --> 01:51:23,680
I think they claimed the song.

1029
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:27,409
No, this is not Dr. Phil.

1030
01:51:28,529 --> 01:51:32,340
Is that Dr. Phil?

1031
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:38,380
No, it's not.

1032
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:40,979
Is this a repeat thing?

1033
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:42,100
Did we talk about this already?

1034
01:51:42,899 --> 01:51:48,340
Yes, we did.

1035
01:51:48,739 --> 01:51:50,100
Yeah, I was playing visitor cleanup.

1036
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:50,500
Yeah, you're right.

1037
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:50,979
You're right.

1038
01:51:50,979 --> 01:51:51,220
Yeah.

1039
01:51:51,859 --> 01:52:01,680
Guys, remember, I've spoken out loud for like 20 years straight.

1040
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:05,119
Sometimes it's hard to remember.

1041
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:06,939
All right, this is Beach Vlog.

1042
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,619
There we go.

1043
01:52:11,619 --> 01:52:12,260
Beach Vlog.

1044
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:34,180
Perfect YouTube intro.

1045
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:34,680
Hey.

1046
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,380
Fuck.

1047
01:52:39,569 --> 01:52:40,289
Fuck.

1048
01:52:40,289 --> 01:52:51,409
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

1049
01:52:51,409 --> 01:52:59,600
I am here on vacation.

1050
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,399
Oh, no.

1051
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:03,520
You didn't have the video outside the plane window.

1052
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:25,619
And it got me through many waves.

1053
01:53:25,619 --> 01:53:37,439
Nobody used this for what I wanted either.

1054
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,029
Nobody put me on a slide.

1055
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:57,069
What the fuck is going on?

1056
01:53:57,069 --> 01:53:57,710
I'm going to sneeze.

1057
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:00,670
I just want you to understand I'm going to sneeze.

1058
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:01,710
No, I don't want you to be near me.

1059
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:07,229
I held it in.

1060
01:54:07,789 --> 01:54:10,859
No, don't sneeze.

1061
01:54:10,859 --> 01:54:11,340
Don't sneeze.

1062
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:11,899
Don't sneeze.

1063
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:16,050
Sorry for making this mess of a video.

1064
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:16,689
It's 3 a.m.

1065
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:17,250
I'm so bored.

1066
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:18,050
Thanks for watching, though.

1067
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:19,890
I'll be surprised that this even makes it in.

1068
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,560
Well, it did.

1069
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,770
I liked it.

1070
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:33,409
What's wrong with it?

1071
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:37,970
This stylish desktop computer comes with a Pentium 4 processor, DVD,

1072
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:41,810
ROM, 60 gigabyte hard drive, and a printer, a perfect addition to your home.

1073
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:46,289
Every American I was told had that computer 15 years ago.

1074
01:54:47,329 --> 01:54:53,859
$150, Tracy.

1075
01:54:53,859 --> 01:54:54,819
$900.

1076
01:54:54,819 --> 01:54:56,260
$900, Craig.

1077
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,720
$1,700.

1078
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,439
$700.

1079
01:55:02,539 --> 01:55:03,039
Bruh.

1080
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,810
Yes.

1081
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:08,550
What is $12?

1082
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:25,430
What the fuck happened?

1083
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:28,369
You're going to play the piano.

1084
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:37,199
Do you eat ass?

1085
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,359
I think I should be the first person to say yes.

1086
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:46,159
Oh, all right.

1087
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:47,039
This is like you made it.

1088
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:48,479
Well, look, this is your moment.

1089
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:49,119
And good luck.

1090
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:52,319
You made like a this is a Simon.

1091
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:22,020
I've heard enough.

1092
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,520
Come on.

1093
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,460
Come on.

1094
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:42,789
This isn't working for me.

1095
01:56:42,789 --> 01:56:47,029
I'm just looking and seeing some of the others where I'm seeing originality.

1096
01:56:47,029 --> 01:56:48,789
This, to me, is too generic.

1097
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,789
Not enough personality.

1098
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:53,470
Huh?

1099
01:56:55,779 --> 01:56:56,279
Okay.

1100
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,420
We have a guy back here.

1101
01:56:59,060 --> 01:56:59,859
What's that, sir?

1102
01:57:00,899 --> 01:57:02,739
I'm kind of in the middle of doing something here.

1103
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:05,880
Can we get security to take care of this guy?

1104
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:12,649
You could be funnier than I am.

1105
01:57:12,649 --> 01:57:13,850
I highly doubt that, though.

1106
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:57,979
It's crazy, people.

1107
01:58:04,859 --> 01:58:05,500
That was great.

1108
01:58:07,399 --> 01:58:08,439
To be continued.

1109
01:58:12,329 --> 01:58:14,090
The Kylo German drive-through.

1110
01:58:16,069 --> 01:58:17,189
My fucking eyes hurt.

1111
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:22,180
My eyes hurt from just like laughing at this shit.

1112
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:22,739
Okay, here we go.

1113
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:58,100
Can I get a you guys you can still have coffee.

1114
01:58:58,100 --> 01:58:59,140
And you guys have coffee.

1115
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:01,460
It says you serve breakfast all day.

1116
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:05,689
I'm one of those fucking weirdos that comes at like 7 30 looking for all the breakfast items.

1117
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:09,550
Okay.

1118
01:59:11,689 --> 01:59:22,779
Wow, this place is sick.

1119
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:33,350
Can you put the ice in it?

1120
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:36,310
Can you put some ice in the coffee, please?

1121
01:59:51,159 --> 02:00:03,510
Oh, really good use of the bugleberry cameo.

1122
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:12,380
He loves it.

1123
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:13,579
Can you put the ice in it?

1124
02:00:13,579 --> 02:00:14,779
He loves McDonald's.

1125
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,539
Okay, there's German in a bottle of water.

1126
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:50,010
Who will breathe?

1127
02:00:55,369 --> 02:00:55,869
Idiots.

1128
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:01,020
Yeah.

1129
02:01:06,819 --> 02:01:08,500
This is the thing I'm talking about right here.

1130
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:10,340
I told you guys this before.

1131
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:13,300
Absolute perfection.

1132
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,800
No ifs, ands, or buts.

1133
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:20,760
This right here is absolute perfection.

1134
02:01:24,659 --> 02:01:36,840
This is it right here.

1135
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,119
No, it's not purple alien.

1136
02:01:38,119 --> 02:01:39,159
Don't get your hopes up.

1137
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:47,859
Hey, are you in charge of this?

1138
02:01:47,859 --> 02:01:51,430
Here's what I have to say about this.

1139
02:01:52,869 --> 02:01:53,750
See this bullshit.

1140
02:02:02,569 --> 02:02:03,689
What is cool breeze?

1141
02:02:04,659 --> 02:02:05,619
What's cool breeze?

1142
02:02:10,149 --> 02:02:17,670
Wait a minute.

1143
02:02:17,670 --> 02:02:19,270
Oh, I'm tensing up for this one.

1144
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:20,949
Jerma hits a home run.

1145
02:02:21,930 --> 02:02:26,119
Yes, it's a fictional drink in the valve universe.

1146
02:02:26,119 --> 02:02:28,949
Oh, here we go.

1147
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:31,050
Jerma hits a home run.

1148
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:50,020
This pixelation is so ridiculous.

1149
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:04,199
What are you playing as?

1150
02:03:05,479 --> 02:03:09,399
I'm going to play Team Fortress 2 as the pyromaniac.

1151
02:03:09,399 --> 02:03:11,640
I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as?

1152
02:03:12,279 --> 02:03:12,920
Mario.

1153
02:03:21,939 --> 02:03:22,899
Woo hoo hoo.

1154
02:03:22,899 --> 02:03:37,640
Hey shit.

1155
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,840
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to talk about this so much.

1156
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,479
I've heard of that before.

1157
02:03:45,479 --> 02:03:46,760
Go grab yourself a nice pizza.

1158
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,800
Pizza music.

1159
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:48,520
Good enough.

1160
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,199
Let's get out of here.

1161
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:55,819
Dude, there's a fucking knife.

1162
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:59,180
There's coffee, cheese, it's chicken.

1163
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,140
Coffee Cheetos.

1164
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:00,699
What?

1165
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:01,180
What the?

1166
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:01,659
Chicken.

1167
02:04:01,659 --> 02:04:02,380
Chicken.

1168
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:03,180
Coffee Cheetos.

1169
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:03,819
Coffee Cheetos.

1170
02:04:03,819 --> 02:04:04,619
Coffee Cheetos.

1171
02:04:04,619 --> 02:04:05,340
Chicken.

1172
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:06,140
Coffee Cheetos.

1173
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:07,020
Coffee Cheetos.

1174
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:07,659
Chicken.

1175
02:04:07,659 --> 02:04:07,979
Chicken.

1176
02:04:07,979 --> 02:04:08,460
Chicken.

1177
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,260
Coffee Cheetos.

1178
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:09,899
Coffee Cheetos.

1184
02:05:08,039 --> 02:06:49,619
yeah sneaking around two-fourth same same turkey arms

1185
02:06:49,619 --> 02:06:59,229
Jerma's bunt of 46 veteran player Jeremy Albertson had joined the Boston Red Sox

1186
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:03,010
Jeremy had found himself playing with some of the greatest ever put on the

1187
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:08,609
Red Sox uniform like Bobby Doerr Johnny Pesky and Teddy Ballgame himself Ted

1188
02:07:08,609 --> 02:07:13,869
Williams Jeremy was a strong player being a consistently good hitter

1189
02:07:13,869 --> 02:07:17,750
throughout his entire career however Jeremy was quite mediocre when it came

1190
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:21,989
to his defense his short stature meant that some balls would go right past him

1191
02:07:21,989 --> 02:07:28,380
when the ball gets past Albertson he can't reach it now one more score and when

1192
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:42,350
Jeremy was moved to the outfield things didn't get any better but on one fateful

1193
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:47,279
day during one fateful game Jeremy would write himself into their history books

1194
02:07:47,279 --> 02:07:56,380
forever with one visit to the batter's box somebody did it so it is the bunt

1195
02:07:56,380 --> 02:08:17,180
home run and sure enough the home run became history

1196
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:21,000
Jeremy remains as the only player to have bunted a ball for an out-of-the-park

1197
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:26,180
home run many have tried but Albertson's home run stands alone to this day

1198
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:37,189
excellent excellent excellent excellent all right coming up next

1199
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:41,029
you know what's cool about baseball now Rich is if we get Jerma's final game

1200
02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:46,149

like coming in oh fuck dude oh he's got he's got a knife this is Jeremy I once

1223
02:11:24,729 --> 02:11:29,210
started in 34 year old with a loving following a gamer girlfriend and a

1224
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:34,890
stable job he was on top of the mountain of success his life seemed to

1225
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:40,649
be perfect then what went wrong from primetime streamer down to a hole of

1226
02:11:40,649 --> 02:11:51,380
addiction and fights we go down the rat hole of German I net five I dead in this

1227
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:57,770
video it all began with his notorious dreams of various games which amazed

1228
02:11:57,770 --> 02:12:02,250
millions of views and thousands of followers thanks to his charming

1229
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:09,460
personality and humor this quickly skyrocketed Jeremy into success at first

1230
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:13,819
he was easy going with his newfound fundings spending his newfound money on

1231
02:12:13,819 --> 02:12:17,899
better quality for his streams and better games to entertain his fan base

1232
02:12:17,899 --> 02:12:25,189
but this power quickly began to take a toll on his populating quickly made him

1233
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:30,350
develop on it for more power as you can sometimes see his streams the rage he

1234
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:34,670
had boiling inside of him streams quickly dropped in quality as he became

1235
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:39,109
more desperate for probability eventually this will lead to a gambling

1236
02:12:39,109 --> 02:12:45,029
addiction as to find any way of feeling strong once more but it will prove to

1237
02:12:45,029 --> 02:12:52,279
become a failed attempt I don't even care if I win this is the rush of the colors

1238
02:12:52,279 --> 02:12:58,909
now with no money and no fame he resorted to giving morale speeches in the

1239
02:12:58,909 --> 02:13:05,640
high school dance nervous for all of us so on this particular day that's so

1240
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:17,560

02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:49,060
as we try to capture footage he recognized us and became hostile very quickly

1246
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:52,260
why do I have to hurt and kill so many of you guys

1247
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:54,260

police were called but in his rageful state of mind he resisted arrest and

1250
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:27,189
that's the end of Jeremy's story from what it seemed to be the peak of success

1251
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:51,100

This is a videos that

1309
02:25:39,389 --> 02:25:41,389
resurfaced

1310
02:25:41,389 --> 02:25:43,389
10 years later that I should be embarrassed of now

1311
02:25:43,389 --> 02:25:50,409
Today

1312
02:25:50,409 --> 02:25:52,409
Oh hey look at this clip of you dude

1313
02:25:52,409 --> 02:25:54,409
Remember back when you did this shit

1314
02:25:56,409 --> 02:25:58,409
That was like 2 months ago

1315
02:25:58,409 --> 02:26:04,729
It's like oh remember back in 2011

1316
02:26:04,729 --> 02:26:06,729
when you made the

1317
02:26:06,729 --> 02:26:08,729
Minecraft series, JermaCraft

1318
02:26:08,729 --> 02:26:11,479
That's the kind of reaction I should be having to these

1319
02:26:11,479 --> 02:26:13,479
But I did them like

1320
02:26:13,479 --> 02:26:20,590
Not even a year ago

1321
02:26:20,590 --> 02:26:25,000
Alright

1322
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
I'm going to take

1323
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Next like 2 or 3 weeks

1324
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
And 100 days

1325
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Only focus on

1326
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
This game my dog

1327
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,239
Say goodbye to your seed might want to do

1328
02:26:37,239 --> 02:26:39,239
That seed might want to do

1329
02:26:39,239 --> 02:26:41,239
And get actually definitively

1330
02:26:41,239 --> 02:26:43,239
Truly diagnosed

1331
02:26:43,239 --> 02:26:45,239
For whatever the fuck is

1332
02:26:45,239 --> 02:26:49,600
Going on

1333
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:51,600
What is this

1334
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:58,319
Oh alright

1335
02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:02,090
Alright

1336
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:04,090
Goodbye

1337
02:27:04,090 --> 02:27:06,329
Also

1338
02:27:06,329 --> 02:27:08,329
I wouldn't here

1339
02:27:08,329 --> 02:27:10,329
I got to talk about this

1340
02:27:10,329 --> 02:27:12,329
So this kind of bleeds into a conversation we can have about

1341
02:27:12,329 --> 02:27:14,329
Future videos

1342
02:27:14,329 --> 02:27:17,659
If we could stay away from

1343
02:27:17,659 --> 02:27:20,159
Like real

1344
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:23,229
Tragedy

1345
02:27:23,229 --> 02:27:26,879
That would be a very good thing

1346
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:28,879
There's been a couple of videos that have come through that are like

1347
02:27:28,879 --> 02:27:30,879
Oh hey we've got like

1348
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:33,180
Oh there's like a house

1349
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:35,180
That burnt down and stuff you know what I mean

1350
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:41,069
Like oh no but this is

1351
02:27:41,069 --> 02:27:43,069
This is the Paul Walker clip right

1352
02:27:43,069 --> 02:27:52,409
Cause don't they do like a thing

1353
02:27:52,409 --> 02:27:58,879
It's the movie no I know it's the movie

1354
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:01,690
But what I'm saying is like

1355
02:28:01,690 --> 02:28:03,690
This is from Fast and Furious yeah

1356
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:14,559
That is dumb

1357
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:16,559
What I'm talking about is Paul Walker died

1358
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:18,920
Kind of right before this right

1359
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:22,319
And although this is like

1360
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:24,319
A goodbye to Paul Walker

1361
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:28,799
Right it's I mean putting me

1362
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:32,319
Here I don't know

1363
02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:34,319
Like it's sort of like

1364
02:28:34,319 --> 02:28:38,600
Yeah you're right I'm just

1365
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:41,040
Trying to come off as I'm trying not to be

1366
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,040
I don't want these to be like disrespectful we'll put it that way

1367
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,979
And as however I can

1368
02:28:45,979 --> 02:28:49,120
Say that I'm gonna say that okay

1369
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:56,219
Am I overthinking it maybe

1370
02:28:56,219 --> 02:28:58,219
A little bit but I still I don't I know that like

1371
02:28:58,219 --> 02:29:00,219
Some some stuff can come

1372
02:29:00,219 --> 02:29:02,719
Across as like

1373
02:29:02,719 --> 02:29:04,719
Disrespectful and I don't want that to happen

1374
02:29:04,719 --> 02:29:13,920
But let's go

1375
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:15,920
I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile

1376
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:19,559
At a time and I think that's why

1377
02:29:19,559 --> 02:29:22,379
We were broke

1378
02:29:22,379 --> 02:29:24,379
It's his channel well

1379
02:29:24,379 --> 02:29:26,379
Look there's been a lot of videos that have come through

1380
02:29:26,379 --> 02:29:32,459
And we try to like

1381
02:29:32,459 --> 02:29:34,459
Put them in a good enough order

1382
02:29:34,459 --> 02:29:36,459
And we try to take weed out

1383
02:29:36,459 --> 02:29:38,760
There'll be like 500 videos

1384
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:44,200
So my channel my rules

1385
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:47,340
There's also on that list we gotta talk about

1386
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:49,340
Like the copyright stuff we gotta be careful there too

1387
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:51,709
That's another thing we have to

1388
02:29:51,709 --> 02:29:53,709
We'll talk about this at the end

1389
02:29:53,709 --> 02:30:13,719
It's my channel

1390
02:30:13,719 --> 02:30:15,719
It's not it's not your channel

1391
02:30:15,719 --> 02:30:18,409
It's my channel

1392
02:30:18,409 --> 02:30:24,040
He's above the law

1393
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:31,719
The dead angle doesn't date it

1394
02:30:31,719 --> 02:30:33,719
Gets caught low again

1395
02:30:33,719 --> 02:30:35,719
Has to burst immediately

1396
02:30:35,719 --> 02:30:40,840
Low meter

1397
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:43,209
Oh my god

1398
02:30:43,209 --> 02:30:45,209
So smart he couldn't burst

1399
02:30:45,209 --> 02:30:47,209
Because of the super

1400
02:30:47,209 --> 02:30:49,209
But Woshiga thinks it's over

1401
02:30:49,209 --> 02:30:52,159
What the fuck

1402
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:54,159
What the fuck

1403
02:30:54,159 --> 02:31:04,829
Woshiga thought it was over

1404
02:31:04,829 --> 02:31:06,829
Woshiga thought it was over

1405
02:31:06,829 --> 02:31:08,829
And stood up and Ogawa gave him

1406
02:31:08,829 --> 02:31:10,829
No remorse

1407
02:31:10,829 --> 02:31:12,829
Exactly what happens

1408
02:31:12,829 --> 02:31:14,829
Oh my god

1409
02:31:16,829 --> 02:31:19,520
I don't even know what that is

1410
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,520
I don't even know what that is

1411
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:23,520
I just experienced all of it

1412
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:27,290
I experienced that entire tournament

1413
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:39,520
You did though

1414
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:52,250
German 985 show

1415
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:56,540
Oh this looks like shit

1416
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:58,540
Itchy and scratchy

1417
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:00,540
Our favorite show

1418
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:02,540
Nothing about this is good

1419
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:04,540
I'm gonna dab you in the fucking head

1420
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:08,430
Let me tell you something

1421
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:10,430
If you can do not do it diplomically

1422
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:12,430
Then you shouldn't be doing it at all

1423
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:14,920
Now I'm really bored

1424
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:16,920
I know

1425
02:32:23,069 --> 02:32:25,950
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode one

1426
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:27,950
Of the show

1427
02:32:27,950 --> 02:32:29,950
My name is German 985

1428
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:31,950
Let's get this party started

1429
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:34,190
And here we are

1430
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:36,190
The master of illusions

1431
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:38,190
Is ready to begin

1432
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:40,680
It's gonna be very very interesting

1433
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:42,680
And you're gonna say the magic words with me

1434
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:44,680
Anytime we do a trick

1435
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:46,680
You gotta say the magic word

1436
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,680
The magic word is presto

1437
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:50,989
Majesto

1438
02:32:50,989 --> 02:32:52,989
So on the count of three I want everyone to say

1439
02:32:52,989 --> 02:32:54,989
Presto majesto

1440
02:32:54,989 --> 02:32:56,989
One, two, three

1441
02:32:56,989 --> 02:32:58,989
Presto

1442
02:32:58,989 --> 02:33:00,989
Majesto

1443
02:33:00,989 --> 02:33:05,399
Deliver this

1444

Ladies and gentlemen

Again? Really? You're gonna do this again?

1446
02:33:09,399 --> 02:33:11,399
This is the best fucking life nerd

1447
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:13,399
Who's never gotten pussy before in his entire life

1448
02:33:13,399 --> 02:33:15,399
God damn it you motherfucker

1449
02:33:15,399 --> 02:33:17,399

It's supposed to be

1453
02:33:30,969 --> 02:33:54,590
German and the prisoner of

1454
02:33:54,590 --> 02:33:58,430

1465
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:41,159
That's it

1466
02:34:41,159 --> 02:34:44,299
What the fuck

1467
02:34:44,299 --> 02:34:53,450
You got something to say

1468
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:57,159
Look at me

1469
02:34:57,159 --> 02:34:59,159
Look at me, look at me

Catch it

1478
02:35:53,739 --> 02:35:58,219
No that's not what I'm talking about

1479
02:35:58,219 --> 02:36:00,219
I just want to see this one again

1480
02:36:00,219 --> 02:36:10,569
That's not

1481
02:36:10,569 --> 02:36:12,569
Real tragedy

It was a great time

1529
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,930

1531
02:38:46,219 --> 02:38:48,219
Die you motherfucker

02:39:31,870 --> 02:39:33,870
I'm out and about right now

1539
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:35,870
And I'm having a ton of fun

1540
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:37,870
It's so cool, I don't even wish

Good thing I caught you

1545
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:04,840
Right at the beginning of the video

1546
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:06,840
I'm about to skip this one, this one sucks

1547
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:16,059
Should I do it? Should I do it?

1548
02:40:16,059 --> 02:41:03,930
Jojo?

1549
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:11,100
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure?

1550
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:13,100
No, no, if something, there's music behind it

1551
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:19,950
With me dancing in front of it, it's not Jojo

1552
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:21,950
This is Jerma caught on camera, should we do a piss break?

1553
02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:24,889
Anybody got a piss?

1554
02:41:24,889 --> 02:41:29,500
Got a pee? It's probably going to be final pee break

1555
02:41:29,500 --> 02:41:31,930
Yeah, alright, final pee break

1556
02:41:31,930 --> 02:43:48,639
Let's go, alright

1557
02:43:48,639 --> 02:43:57,319
I feel good, I feel good

1558
02:43:57,319 --> 02:43:59,319
We are down to the final

1559
02:43:59,319 --> 02:44:01,629
We're almost in the top 50 of videos

1560
02:44:01,629 --> 02:44:03,629
That have been submitted

1561
02:44:03,629 --> 02:44:06,120
We got about 50, 60 more

1562
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:09,200
Should take another probably hour

1563
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,760
Maybe, or more or less

1564
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:18,670
This is Jerma caught on camera

1565
02:45:22,959 --> 02:45:29,420
How many cameras do you fucking have in your house?

1566
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:44,079
I'm coming for you, you're the one I'm gonna

1567
02:45:44,079 --> 02:45:51,690
Excuse me

1568
02:45:51,690 --> 02:46:33,159
Well that was terrifying

1569
02:46:33,159 --> 02:46:36,299
What's next?

1570
02:46:36,299 --> 02:46:38,299
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

1571
02:46:38,299 --> 02:46:40,299
Episode 1

1572
02:46:40,299 --> 02:46:42,299
Fighting Chat

1573
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:04,409
Actually Jojo this time

1574
02:47:36,090 --> 02:47:38,090
That's some duality of chat right here

1575
02:47:42,090 --> 02:48:00,059
Is that intro, outro?

1576
02:48:00,059 --> 02:48:05,690
I don't know

1577
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:32,430
I'm virtually murdering you

1578
02:48:32,430 --> 02:48:34,430
Just please give me a thumbs up

1579
02:48:34,430 --> 02:48:36,430
And a like

1580
02:48:36,430 --> 02:48:38,430
And I hope you spread the video around to Jojo's parents

1581
02:48:38,430 --> 02:48:40,430
And try to get me some followers

1582
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:42,430
Ok, let's get started

1583
02:48:42,430 --> 02:48:44,430
This is a simulation

1584
02:48:44,430 --> 02:48:46,430
I fucking murder you

1585
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:48,430
Oh my god, I have to get this done

1586
02:48:48,430 --> 02:48:50,430
Please let him go

1587
02:48:50,430 --> 02:49:12,639
Die you motherfucker

1588
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:26,399
This is a real tragedy

1589
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:28,399
Alright, don't

1590
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:30,399
I better not have created a fucking meme for myself

1591
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:32,399
If you like that video, follow me on my journey

1592
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:34,399
Where I virtually will kill you

1593
02:49:34,399 --> 02:49:36,399
Virtual Murder

1594
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:38,399
Virtual ASMR Murder

1595
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:46,010
That was insane

1596
02:49:46,010 --> 02:49:48,010
Brad, wait

1597
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:55,309
Brad will be ending

1598
02:49:55,309 --> 02:50:05,680
Remastered HD

1599
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:07,850
My name is Jerma

1600
02:50:07,850 --> 02:50:11,120
Russian Jerma

1601
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:13,120
A little bit out of gas at this point

1602
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:15,420
Ok

1603
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,420
Jerma gets booed off the stage

1604
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:30,200
Shit

1605
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:32,200
This road sucks

1606
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:35,280
Such a bad road

1607
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:38,909
Seat covers

1608
02:50:38,909 --> 02:50:40,909
Go out and look

1609
02:50:40,909 --> 02:50:43,280
What's with the seat covers

1610
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:48,719
There's a tree, two trees

1611
02:50:48,719 --> 02:50:52,729
Hey mom, hey mom

1612
02:50:52,729 --> 02:50:55,719
Mom, mom

1613
02:50:55,719 --> 02:50:57,719
Did you see the tree

1614
02:50:57,719 --> 02:51:01,680
Hey mom, hey mom

1615
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:06,540
We got going back seat here bitch

1616
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:08,540
The fuck up

1617
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:13,149
The fuck up

1618
02:51:13,149 --> 02:51:17,360
Jesus

1619
02:51:19,979 --> 02:51:21,979
Hey

1620
02:51:21,979 --> 02:51:23,979
You're a badass

1621
02:51:23,979 --> 02:51:25,979
Hey, who are you

1622
02:51:25,979 --> 02:51:27,979
Who are you

1623
02:51:31,979 --> 02:51:34,590
This is terrible

1624
02:51:34,590 --> 02:51:36,590
Absolutely terrible

1625
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:38,590
Jesus

1626
02:51:41,079 --> 02:51:50,809
What is this

1627
02:51:50,809 --> 02:51:55,549
I wanna

1628
02:51:55,549 --> 02:51:57,549
This is the demon dog

1629
02:51:57,549 --> 02:52:00,110
I told you guys this before

1630
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:02,110
Absolute perfection

1631
02:52:06,079 --> 02:52:08,079
We got him

1632
02:52:08,079 --> 02:52:10,079
Wait, hold on

1633
02:52:10,079 --> 02:52:12,079
He actually hits that guy

1634
02:52:12,079 --> 02:52:17,370
Life is pain

1635
02:52:17,370 --> 02:52:19,370
I hate

1636
02:52:19,370 --> 02:52:23,340
What's it called

1637
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:26,090
A TV show

1638
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:28,780
Called El Chavo

1639
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:35,309
It's called Jerma's Brush with Cigarettes

1640
02:52:35,309 --> 02:52:37,610
Real tragedy

1641
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:39,850
I don't know

1642
02:52:41,850 --> 02:52:45,879
Hey

1643
02:52:45,879 --> 02:52:47,879
Get his plate

1644
02:52:50,569 --> 02:52:53,950
That's pretty good

1645
02:52:53,950 --> 02:52:55,950
That's pretty good

1646
02:52:55,950 --> 02:52:57,950
He's probably going 200

1647
02:52:57,950 --> 02:53:00,959
Bounds per hour

1648
02:53:00,959 --> 02:53:02,959
I didn't even see him

1649
02:53:02,959 --> 02:53:04,959
Turn it up

1650
02:53:04,959 --> 02:53:07,260
Turn it up

1651
02:53:07,260 --> 02:53:12,569
I saved the world

1652
02:53:12,569 --> 02:53:14,569
I just saved the world

1653
02:53:14,569 --> 02:53:21,870
No earth exploding

1654
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:42,030
This is rescue Jerma

1655
02:54:00,030 --> 02:54:02,030
Michael

1656
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:18,510
Look at him

1657
02:54:18,510 --> 02:54:25,680
Is that his

1658
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:27,979
That's my thumb

1659
02:54:27,979 --> 02:54:30,159
Right, okay

1660
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:33,680
Jerma becomes

1661
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:37,770
Larry Potter

1662
02:54:37,770 --> 02:54:40,780
I get super excited

1663
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,780
Uncensored version of the one

1664
02:54:42,780 --> 02:54:45,850
Wait, is that the one with the

1665
02:54:45,850 --> 02:54:48,219
Sensor bar over my fake bottom half

1666
02:54:48,219 --> 02:54:52,440
I'm not clicking on that

1667
02:54:52,440 --> 02:55:03,500
Alright, here we go

1668
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:05,500
When I call your name

1669
02:55:05,500 --> 02:55:07,500
You will come forth

1670
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:09,500
I shall place the sorting hat

1671
02:55:09,500 --> 02:55:11,500
On your head

1672
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:13,500
And you will be sorted into your houses

1673
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:15,500
Is it my turn

1674
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:17,500
Oh, great sorting hat

1675
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,680
I know exactly what I'm

1676
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:21,850
Going to get

1677
02:55:21,850 --> 02:55:24,670
I'm a Slytherin

1678
02:55:24,670 --> 02:55:29,209
Right then

1679
02:55:29,209 --> 02:55:31,450
I'm a Slytherin

1680
02:55:31,450 --> 02:55:33,950
No

1681
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:39,000
Stop laughing

1682
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,629
This hat for me immediately

1683
02:55:41,629 --> 02:55:44,639
Torturing

1684
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:46,639
Murdering people, murdering them

1685
02:55:46,639 --> 02:55:48,639
Slytherin

1686
02:55:48,639 --> 02:55:51,520
See, I told you

1687
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:55,479
You're evil too, right

1688
02:55:55,479 --> 02:55:57,479
We're probably going to be really good friends

1689
02:55:57,479 --> 02:56:01,319
I'll probably die in the third movie

1690
02:56:01,319 --> 02:56:03,319
Three movies later, uh oh

1691
02:56:03,319 --> 02:56:08,190
Now hand me the prophecy

1692
02:56:08,190 --> 02:56:12,670
Death eaters

1693
02:56:12,670 --> 02:56:14,670
Expelliars

1694
02:56:14,670 --> 02:56:17,360
Hahahaha

1695
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:23,360
Harry Potter spoilers

1696
02:56:23,360 --> 02:56:32,120
Yeah

1697
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:47,549
Holy shit, this is long

1698
02:56:47,549 --> 02:56:50,299
This is

1699
02:56:50,299 --> 02:57:07,000
Seven and a half minutes

1700
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:15,840
I'm just checking to see how

1701
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:17,840
Just watch it

1702
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,840
If I get the feeling that I'm going to get arrested

1703
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:21,840
I'm going to skip it, okay

1704
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:44,909
Oh

1705
02:57:52,379 --> 02:57:54,379
Both sides

1706
02:57:54,379 --> 02:58:15,549
I gotta skip it

1707
02:58:15,549 --> 02:58:17,549
I gotta skip it, I gotta skip it, I gotta skip it

1708
02:58:17,549 --> 02:58:19,719
I'm going to get arrested, I gotta skip it

1709
02:58:19,719 --> 02:58:22,090
I can't fuck around with that mouse

1710
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:24,459
That mouse will fucking eat me alive

1711
02:58:24,459 --> 02:58:31,690
He'll eat me whole, I will get swallowed whole from the mouse

1712
02:58:31,690 --> 02:58:34,829
Alright, this is a Vod

1713
02:58:34,829 --> 02:58:48,399
Destroyer horse

1714
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:50,399
Why did I just read that out

1715
02:58:50,399 --> 02:59:01,530
Loud, oh

1716
02:59:01,530 --> 02:59:03,530
It's being spammed

1717
02:59:03,530 --> 02:59:05,530
Get it, oh my god

1718
02:59:05,530 --> 02:59:24,540
Skip

1719
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:29,790
No, okay, hold on

1720
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:32,350
I can't

1721
02:59:32,350 --> 02:59:37,659
It's deepfaked

1722
02:59:51,819 --> 02:59:57,260
Don't ever have this hair

1723
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:59,260
Well this is a deepfake

1724
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:01,260
I don't have this hair

1725
03:00:27,319 --> 03:00:30,590
What the hell

1726
03:00:30,590 --> 03:00:32,590
Prove that you don't have this hair right now

1727
03:00:38,860 --> 03:00:40,860
That guy was brain screened, I thought that was me in a costume

1728
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:42,860
I thought that was me in a fucking costume

1729
03:01:08,649 --> 03:01:21,260
For you

1730
03:01:21,260 --> 03:01:23,260
You're the one I'm going to get

1731
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:31,260
I'm kicking ass right now

1732
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,260
It's just a deepfake

1733
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:41,260
It's just a deepfake

1734
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:43,260
The Vod is going to get crucified

1735
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:45,260
The Vod is going to get thrown into a dumpster

1736
03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:58,620
Not only is the Vod going to get crucified

1737
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:00,620
I'm going to be fucking killed

1738
03:02:00,620 --> 03:02:11,819
Playlist will be available

1739
03:02:11,819 --> 03:02:14,959
Somebody said I don't care, continue

1740
03:02:14,959 --> 03:02:17,520
What if I just disappear tomorrow

1741
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:22,250

03:13:20,790 --> 03:13:23,290
It doesn't help that like I you know

1837
03:13:23,290 --> 03:13:26,530

I did I did I did a little bit I did a little bit THC and PCB to make to

1839
03:13:32,290 --> 03:13:34,290
alleviate that and this is probably the wrong day

1840
03:13:34,809 --> 03:13:44,040
Like two hours ago. I was just like wait a minute. What the hell? What the fuck is happening?

1841
03:13:45,360 --> 03:13:49,079
It's about two and a half hours ago. I realized probably you know, that's all right

1842
03:13:52,239 --> 03:13:56,170
By the way, it's a hundred percent legal in Las Vegas recreationally

03:15:35,799 --> 03:15:42,139
No one was gonna ever use this even the ones where I said no one's gonna use this people might but this was what?

All right. Let me let me let me clarify get this out. Let me clarify the statement

2233
04:19:05,829 --> 04:19:13,750
I made earlier what i'm all i'm saying is if you have an option to make me the butt of a joke

2234
04:19:14,309 --> 04:19:26,959
That's all that's better. That's all I meant. That's all I I know it's been thousands of years ago. Yeah

2235
04:19:28,260 --> 04:19:30,260
No, no, no, no, no, it's not. Yeah, it is

2236
04:19:33,700 --> 04:19:37,379
I'm sitting there going wait. Wait, what do you mean? What happened recently? What? Oh pump?

2237
04:19:37,459 --> 04:19:41,219
Yeah, thousands of fucking years ago. That's like saying that the dinosaurs

2238
04:19:41,940 --> 04:19:45,780
No, I don't want to show anything about the dinosaurs because that's the only one extinct

2239
04:19:46,420 --> 04:20:06,790
Oh, no, no, no, you're not supposed to see this. You're not supposed to see this this that's a spoiler

2240
04:20:08,959 --> 04:20:12,280
Shit now you saw the last three videos

2241
04:20:18,049 --> 04:20:31,520
God damn it. All right. It's all right. Okay. Um, let's just let's see what this is 79 ad

2242
04:20:32,159 --> 04:20:35,840
This is like what this is like 2 000 years ago. Do you have any idea?

2243
04:20:36,559 --> 04:20:38,559
The the absolute just

2244
04:21:02,370 --> 04:21:04,370
Daily moisturizer what

2245
04:21:10,229 --> 04:21:12,229
I don't know. I don't know what that what what's that supposed to be?

2246
04:21:14,899 --> 04:21:17,139
It's crashing

2247
04:21:24,879 --> 04:21:41,459
This show was awesome on nickelodeon by the way

2248
04:21:41,860 --> 04:21:49,459
Oh

2249
04:22:25,920 --> 04:22:32,870
All right, we're we've got I think two more videos left I have no idea what they are. Oh fuck you

2250
04:22:41,139 --> 04:22:42,340
Okay, bye

2251
04:22:42,340 --> 04:22:44,340
And now back to george lopez

2252
04:22:46,600 --> 04:22:48,600
an awkward carpool

2253
04:22:48,680 --> 04:23:01,159
Wait, did I change sides that I was driving on?

2254
04:23:02,899 --> 04:23:06,500
Yes. Oh, I had a long day at work. Let's go

2255
04:24:07,489 --> 04:24:09,489
Is it why is he chained into the car

2256
04:24:59,959 --> 04:25:03,860
Okay, this is the final video

2257
04:25:09,090 --> 04:25:11,090
Real tragedy. All right

2258
04:25:11,569 --> 04:25:13,569
I hope you guys know what i'm talking about though

2259
04:25:13,889 --> 04:25:18,770
Look and in my like cbd brain did did I come to do did I could you understand what i'm saying?

2260
04:25:19,250 --> 04:25:23,569
You do right? Okay

2261
04:25:23,569 --> 04:25:31,250
Here's the final video

2262
04:25:31,250 --> 04:25:34,899
The germa bowl before we watch the final video. I want to say

2263
04:25:36,180 --> 04:25:37,639
once again

2264
04:25:37,639 --> 04:25:38,600
that

2265
04:25:38,600 --> 04:25:43,959
I am blown the fuck away by the insane amount of editing talent that a ton of you guys have

2266
04:25:45,989 --> 04:25:47,989
If you would have set up like a green screen thing

2267
04:25:48,309 --> 04:25:52,469
In a lot of places on the internet the amount of quality submissions

2268
04:25:55,010 --> 04:25:57,010
I mean look at me, right? Look at you

2269
04:25:58,739 --> 04:26:07,649
I think I think this is top-notch shit right here. So seriously, thank you for all your submissions

2270
04:26:07,649 --> 04:26:09,889
There were hundreds and fucking hundreds and hundreds of them

2271
04:26:10,950 --> 04:26:13,780
And I it's hard to cut stuff

2272
04:26:14,340 --> 04:26:17,920
If your video was not seen that doesn't mean that the video sucked

2273
04:26:18,319 --> 04:26:21,600
We just tried to remove some things and shrink it down and condense it

2274
04:26:21,600 --> 04:26:26,149
So it could be done over a couple of streams. This playlist is going to be available

2275
04:26:28,000 --> 04:26:30,209
I will give it to you

2276
04:26:30,209 --> 04:26:31,170
and then

2277
04:26:31,170 --> 04:26:34,850
Also, maybe at some point in the next week or so we might do like an extended one

2278
04:26:35,510 --> 04:26:40,899
Just adding some of the other submissions that were there and then you can watch

2279
04:26:41,459 --> 04:26:52,120
And then you can get arrested by disney on your own so part three. No, not part three

2280
04:26:53,840 --> 04:26:58,399
I think from this point forward we're going to take any of the new stuff that comes in and do community content stuff

2281
04:27:00,389 --> 04:27:03,350
And community content night is going to be a lot different

2282
04:27:05,299 --> 04:27:08,659
a lot of the artwork is going to be put into brb screens and

2283
04:27:09,219 --> 04:27:12,530
at the end of the streams

2284
04:27:12,530 --> 04:27:14,770
I can't it's it'll be impossible to catch up

2285
04:27:18,149 --> 04:27:21,909
Even if we did it like every other day or or twice a week three times a week

2286
04:27:22,069 --> 04:27:27,440
There's this three months before I left of content and then when I got back

2287
04:27:28,799 --> 04:27:36,790
You're talking about I was we were already two or three months behind. There's probably six months of artwork and videos

2288
04:27:38,370 --> 04:27:43,479
So I have to think of a solution there how i'm going to do that and the best one I can think of is

2289
04:27:43,959 --> 04:27:45,719
Because I don't want people to get

2290
04:27:45,959 --> 04:27:53,969
Community content exhaustion. It's one of the reasons why I broke this stream up into two after, you know, four or five six hours

2291
04:27:54,770 --> 04:28:00,420
Of I don't want to just be scanning through pieces of artwork three four times a week

2292
04:28:01,139 --> 04:28:03,780
Because if people do an art piece of art for this channel

2293
04:28:04,680 --> 04:28:08,360
I want someone to see it and I want it obviously to be like, oh well look that's cool

2294
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:11,000
But I don't want to exhaust everybody with like

2295
04:28:12,079 --> 04:28:14,239
Okay, we're gonna we're gonna play a video game today

2296
04:28:14,319 --> 04:28:16,719
And then the next two days are going to be artwork and videos

2297
04:28:19,670 --> 04:28:23,590
And I don't want to me personally be sitting there going skip skip skip skip skip skip I gotta go fucking fast

2298
04:28:23,590 --> 04:28:27,719
There's 3 000 of these. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks

2299
04:28:27,719 --> 04:28:30,920
Hey, no, I don't want to do that because I obviously if you took the time to do it

2300
04:28:30,920 --> 04:28:33,139
I would want you to I don't want to just skip through you

2301
04:28:37,540 --> 04:28:41,680
Play it already. We're going over the future of the community content stuff, man. Come on

2302
04:28:44,500 --> 04:28:48,610
Uh, let's watch the last one. This is the germa bowl and then I'll put the link in chat

2303
04:28:49,170 --> 04:28:54,260
And we will say our goodbyes. Thanks again, everybody

2304
04:28:55,120 --> 04:28:58,120
Excellent fucking work. You floor me every time

2305
04:28:59,190 --> 04:29:01,190
My face hurts my chest hurts

2306
04:29:01,430 --> 04:29:06,069
Everything just hurts. I'm gonna take a bath after this. Here we go

2307
04:29:15,139 --> 04:29:20,260
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is anthony wimbles and coming at you with a shoutcast our germa 95 seattle

2308
04:29:20,420 --> 04:29:23,299
I got a lot of requests to get back into this and do another shoutcast

2309
04:29:23,379 --> 04:29:28,180
So i'm gonna start it here we go. One, two, three, four five. Let's do it. Are you fucking serious right now?

2310
04:29:30,659 --> 04:29:46,399
Get out of here two players

2311
04:30:12,600 --> 04:30:33,969
Wait what unfortunately

2312
04:30:34,049 --> 04:30:36,770
Your saturday football game is gonna get potentially rained out

2313
04:30:41,760 --> 04:30:45,010
Okay, that's it

2314
04:30:45,010 --> 04:30:48,370
Great honor to meet you, sir. Peter. I hear you fight the scientist

2315
04:30:49,329 --> 04:30:54,770
Well, i'm something of a scientist myself. I read all your research on nanotechnology really brilliant

2316
04:30:56,610 --> 04:30:59,729
Okay

2317
04:30:59,729 --> 04:31:02,079
Oh

2318
04:31:02,079 --> 04:31:04,079
Yeah, the playlist is in the chat right now

2319
04:31:05,239 --> 04:31:09,940
That was a ton of fun. It saddens me that this is the

2320
04:31:10,819 --> 04:31:12,340
second and final

2321
04:31:12,340 --> 04:31:16,520
Part one and then part two

2322
04:31:16,520 --> 04:31:18,520
But that doesn't mean we won't do this again

2323
04:31:18,520 --> 04:31:24,340
I think every year or two

2324
04:31:24,819 --> 04:31:26,819
Going in front of the screen and doing a ton more stuff

2325
04:31:27,540 --> 04:31:30,549
I'm cool with that

2326
04:31:30,549 --> 04:31:32,920
And then obviously stuff for community content

04:31:33,479 --> 04:31:35,649
