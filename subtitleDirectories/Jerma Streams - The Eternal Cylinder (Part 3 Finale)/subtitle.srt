1
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:48,409
Yeah, sorry, I'm a little late. But I was in pre-stream chat, and oh, did I get his turn stream off?

2
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:55,700
Nope. Okay, I gotta get in a better habit of doing this. So when I press turn stream on, go live,

3
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,180
right? It's a button you press on OBS. I press it, and then just move my hand off the mouse.

4
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:11,000
So it's like, go live, it's still hovering over it. And sometimes I'm talking with my hands right

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,840
now. Just, oh, hey, everybody, how you doing? Move my hands around. And if I press the space bar,

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:33,030
the stream will turn off. It's happened once or twice before. Oops. No, we're good. How you doing?

7
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,609
Hope your night's going well. Hope your day is going well. Hope your weekend has been okay.

8
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:50,420
That's been pretty good. We're going to try to finish the eternal cylinder tonight. I know

9
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:58,489
that there is potentially another three to five hours, depending on how many, you know,

10
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:09,319
sauce rants I go on tonight. I think we'll finish tonight. I think we'll get through it. Three to

11
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:22,250
five, about four to four and a half. We'll see. You should eat leaves on stream. Lettuce, I've done

12
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:31,210
that already. I already did that. Do you guys not remember? I don't know. Maybe you don't.

13
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,659
One time I just ate. When was that? That was like last year. I grabbed like as big a handful of

14
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:46,740
spinach or lettuce as I possibly could fit in my mouth and just didn't say anything. I did that.

15
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,659
I've done that like probably three times. I've done that. I've done that joke like three times.

16
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:07,340
At this point, is it even a joke or is it? I don't know. Not really. I do have tea and I do

17
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:14,259
appreciate the people telling me to take the tea bags out because I only got another minute before

18
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:27,909
I need to take them out. Different tea today. This is a peach tea. Oh, hold on. I think it's

19
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:43,930
got hibiscus in it. Is that good for you? Hibiscus, rose. I think there's rose in this. Is that good?

20
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:54,860
Do you put anything in your tea? No. I drink my tea with zero sugar, zero honey. I'm one of those

21
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,419
weirdos. Try peppermint tea. I actually really like peppermint tea, but it makes me go to the bathroom.

22
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:14,020
So not a great stream tea, I will say. You know, I don't want to drink a big peppermint tea

23
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,180
because in 30, 40 minutes I'll be like, ah, see you later. I'll be back.

24
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:28,600
It was during the later alligator stream. I feel like I did it during a multiverse. No, that was

25
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:38,310
carrots. I don't remember. But anyways, are you guys ready? Let's not waste any time.

26
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,910
I'm going to get right to it. I feel like during a multiverse stream, I did it.

27
00:04:49,639 --> 00:05:06,230
Carrots and lettuce. Why do you delete tweets after the stream? Well, because,

28
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:12,389
so here's the problem is I don't really use Twitter that often. I don't know. I only use it to

29
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:21,850
tweet out streams. My Twitter would just be links to the stream. If you went to my timeline, it would

30
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:34,360
just be a thousand links to my stream. It'd be awful. And also too, when the stream is over,

31
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,360
I don't want to have, since somebody's timeline be, oh, he's live. Cool. I'm going to join. And

32
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:55,180
I'm just not. So it's just temporary. Stop talking. I want to see Gunu. I do too. Yeah,

33
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:22,699
shut this guy up. Let's go. Where did we leave off? I don't remember. Oh, that's right. We got to

34
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:32,569
this new world. We got to the new area. We're in part three. What was the last thing we had to do?

35
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,459
There you go. Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his sibling's fate.

36
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:45,269
And the Trebum felt the weight of the bad news. Okay. So he's going to go to the temple. I,

37
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:50,230
one thing about this game I really do appreciate is this thing. The, hey, here are the two points

38
00:06:50,230 --> 00:07:07,879
of intro. Oh, I, okay. We have to go over there. Don't care. Switch to Gunu. Gunu? Where's Gunu?

39
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:24,920
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Clap. Okay. So I have to go this way, but let me go over here

40
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:38,259
first. You just sounded like a dog. Wait, we need to eat. Who's got food? You do? No, you do.

41
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:55,420
Who needs food? Don't just throw the stakes away. What are you crazy? Stop that. We need those. How

42
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:11,180
did I only get one? Who's taking all the stakes? You. Can we get a recap? Um, okay. We're kind of

43
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,300
at the, we're near the, I think, the final arc of the game. So give me a second. All right.

44
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:25,500
There are these creatures and they are called Trevums. And that's what we have here. They are

45
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:33,379
little magical creatures that can, you know, just go watch the intro cinematic on YouTube.

46
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,940
It's probably two minutes. It's going to take me eight minutes of just stumbling around,

47
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,169
slowly talking to explain it. You know what I mean? In the, in the amount of time of me going.

48
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:53,830
So it's these creatures that during the journey you, you could have already watched the opening

49
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:07,220
cinematic. That's a cop out. That's fine. Here. How about this? Run away from the giant rolling pin

50
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,759
that is crushing all civilization. There you go. I think that's accurate. Oh, this is a, this is a

51
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:28,789
cloud. I think we're good. Yeah. I don't think we need to do anything here. I have a lot of

52
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:41,269
crystals. I got to use them. The real question is, all right, it's under there. That's a new enemy.

53
00:09:41,269 --> 00:10:11,049
What was that? What just happened? Who's the DPS? All right. The okay. Uh, the DPS is

54
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:24,899
this guy right here. He has a stomp. Can I not do it? Sorry. This guy has a stomp. This guy also can,

55
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:31,929
uh, can take, um, bombs from this one. So this is like a damage support and I'm the one that

56
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:41,179
actually shoots the bombs. I think that's the only DPS I have and it's not even DPS. It's just

57
00:10:41,179 --> 00:11:04,490
anybody can be anything. For instance, check this out. I missed everybody run. I would have

58
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,169
gotten booted from red right there. All right. We have to go down because this thing's going to

59
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:17,559
shoot us. Sick gameplay. It went right through his legs. That's not my fault. Can we make it?

60
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:41,929
I wonder if I can just make it. What's going on? Did I make it? This is bad. Oh, get up here. Get

61
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:48,870
up here. Some of you get up here before he breathes poison on us. All right. Go, go. What are you

62
00:11:48,870 --> 00:12:00,789
doing? Ooh, I like that. Okay. Well, don't touch it. Don't touch it. What are you doing?

63
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:08,820
Why are they standing on it? Did anyone else hear from Australia? Why is Derma playing with

64
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:18,980
outback animals? You know, I thought, Oh my God, my T, why didn't anybody tell me it's been sitting

65
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:31,750
for like 15 minutes? Shit. Oh, hold on. Oh, I told you guys to tell me it was one minute.

66
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:38,419
The tannin is going to be bad. We'll find out. How long has the stream been on for? 13 minutes.

67
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:50,570
Shit. It means it's been there for at least 15. God damn it. Whatever. I think it's all right.

68
00:12:50,570 --> 00:13:02,389
Oh, tastes pretty good. I think we're dying in here. What an inhospitable place this was.

69
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:08,019
The air was suffocating and the heat was almost unbearable. Oh shit. The trebum would have to

70
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:14,419
make good use of their abilities to overcome the obstacles before them. Okay. Um, but who would

71
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:19,779
choose to actually live here? All right. We actually have to move now. Terrible things.

72
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:27,019
They must have endured in the outside world. No, this is not fireproof. I don't think this is

73
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:42,710
fireproof. Is there anything fireproof in here? Is this water hot? This is hot. Everybody get in

74
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:55,720
the water. I can't tell. I think I just have to go fast. Do I have any? Hold on. Really important.

75
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:08,950
Do I actually have any healing? I don't have zero healing and there's nothing I can do about this.

76
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,389
Oh shit. Hold on. Somebody don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't

77
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:25,059
We're fine. Is this it? Fire resistant bark? Okay. Um, we're gonna eat this right now.

78
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:37,049
Uh, Gino's gonna eat this. Who's gonna eat this? I wonder if only one can eat it. I'm gonna give it

79
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:57,289
to Vu. Where's Vu? Vu, where are you? Vu, where are you? Oh, did it work? Did it work? It worked.

80
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:03,539
Oh thank god. Okay. I got fire resist. Now I also have a permanent mutation I can do. Thank goodness.

81
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:20,860
Where is it? Where was it? It was the thing with the tongue. It looked like the tongue. What the

82
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:32,580
heck is it? Where is it? Oh there it is. Okay I need three crystals and I can get this permanently.

83
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:41,610
So who has it? Didn't I keep three? I'll get it eventually. Okay. Oh I do have it. Why is it

84
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:57,700
showing up as I don't? Huh? That's weird. Somebody in the oh it's probably somebody in the in the

85
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:07,850
cloud. All right. We're safe. We're good. Everybody eat up. Very cool. I'm very happy about this.

86
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:16,759
I would say that's pretty sick. Oh I actually have a cool announcement to make. Um, pretty pretty

87
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,409
cool stuff. Those of you that were big fans of the Elden Ring streams with, uh, Stir and I.

88
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:32,679
This coming weekend we're gonna do it again. More mods. More mayhem. At least for one more day.

89
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:42,730
So that should be fun. I don't want to take too much of this shit because it is. It is shit. Let's

90
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:53,429
be honest. All right. There's an elder down here somewhere. Let me pay attention for a second.

91
00:16:53,429 --> 00:17:21,400
Crystals. Where's my crystal eater? They all look really cool. They have scales now. He really wanted

92
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,140
to announce that on his stream but I mean I'm just gonna. He was like I have a huge thing planned.

93
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,259
I'm gonna do a huge announcement for it and I'm like oh cool cool cool and then I'm just doing it.

94
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:55,029
Oh did I miss a way to go up? Terrible friend. I'm I'm just kidding. Whoa hold on. Ooh this kind

95
00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:37,799
of hurts my eyes. Does this burn if I touch it? Is it? Oh won't lose anybody Andy. Well it said

96
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,599
that fireproof skin. I'm like okay so what does that mean? The hypothesis. Come on.

97
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,559
To make good use of their abilities to overcome the obstacles before them.

98
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:59,690
All right where's the voodoo? But who would choose to actually live here? Terrible things

99
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,390
they must have endured. Resistance not proof. Yeah but I don't know how. Resist high. I don't know

100
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,799
what the game was trying to do. Who knows? Some games it's like yeah you're immune to fire damage

101
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:20,200
or you take like 100% less fire. Whatever 90% less fire damage. Yeah at what point does fire

102
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,359
resist become fire immunity? If I wear 500 fire resistant t-shirts can I go into the lava? At what

103
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:38,140
point is it immunity? If I get into a fire resistant space suit can I and it's airtight

104
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:52,809
can I can I dunk into lava? Anyways who made the first sauce? Anybody know? Okay let's try this

105
00:19:52,809 --> 00:20:07,589
again. I'm not saying I'm gonna dunk it. I'm talking about video game logic. I actually need

106
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:23,460
three of these right now. So this is permanent mutation for um the fire trunk. Should I just put it on

107
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:36,980
everybody? Why not? Well maybe not. I don't need it right now. All right we're gonna have to get

108
00:20:36,980 --> 00:21:16,680
these off the wall. Hold on. Where's my uh p-expert? Is this the p-expert? Is this the p-expert? No it's

109
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:27,740
not. Who is the who is the p-expert? I know I have one. Did I did I get removed? It might have gotten

110
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:56,500
removed. I really fucking want those. I'm such like a crystal fiend. I need it. Watch out. Ah whatever.

111
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:17,980
Can't get them all. I want those extra ones. Whatever. Just move on. I know but I want them.

112
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:27,609
Wait a minute nobody go near this. Don't I did you hear what I just said? Why would you? Well you

113
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:53,829
can't hear me but why did you do that? What's going on? Okay um what's get out of the get out

114
00:22:53,829 --> 00:23:03,220
of the light get out of the light get out of the light. This is new. Uh you lost a power. Shit it's

115
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:17,029
okay. You take this thing. I don't know what this is but go for it. Perceptive eyes to see light

116
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:25,509
frequencies that otherwise cannot be perceived which may reveal important secrets. All right

117
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:33,859
here's what I'm thinking glow in the dark glow in the dark eyes jump legs horn snout. Now that's

118
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:40,740
gonna be pretty cool looking. Okay perceptive eyes. I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

119
00:23:40,740 --> 00:24:02,619
Open this somehow with our perceptive eyes. Can we move this? Oh I'm gonna take another one.

120
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:22,549
I'm probably gonna need it later. Okay what is that? I don't understand what that's trying to

121
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:46,839
tell me. Like don't touch that. How do I get through here? Can I break this? I can't go

122
00:24:46,839 --> 00:25:03,880
through here. Okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna go try not to touch it. Whoa wait a minute. What is

123
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:15,619
what is this? What did I do? I guess I turned it off because I went close to it. I can't.

124
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:33,750
Stop. Oh my god. Where's my oh my god. What a fucking disaster. I don't know what it wants

125
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:50,019
me to do. Okay I went close to it so it stops but who gives a shit. How do I I just don't get it.

126
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:59,660
I don't know what it's even asking me to do. I'm going back. You can pass but who cares. I

127
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:08,009
could pass before. Just I don't I don't understand what the game like wants me to

128
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:14,470
do with this information. What an inhospitable place this was. The air was suffocating and the

129
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:20,789
heat was almost unbearable. The trebum would have to make good use of their abilities to overcome

130
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,390
the obstacles. Like was the only point to get in here and just get the eyes and then leave? Who

131
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:39,319
would choose to actually live here? Terrible things they must have endured in the outside world.

132
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:47,400
Dead run. I think that's my least I think that's the part of the game that I don't like the most

133
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:55,349

174
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:21,260
stomp it hold on I don't want to lose everybody's powers smoke mutation um I don't think anybody has

that right now no no I think it got removed I don't think anybody has it just go to the door

176
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:47,099
see what you're saying like I don't need to touch these it made a sound when I did that though

177
00:40:47,099 --> 00:41:08,980
okay there's nothing here um who had that power before you stand on the other button I hate that

178
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,860
mechanic I hate the delete the power button you spend so much time trying to get your guys good

179
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,519
to go and then this is just a thing in the game that just removes it that's annoying I hate it

180
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:42,010
okay I stepped on them both okay could you please stop doing that oh my god I didn't even do

181
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:54,260
anything I mean they just what else am I supposed to do it didn't go all the way down you gotta be

182
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:26,300
fucking kidding me so you just we just all have to lose our powers now lame lame lame that's lame

183
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:38,900
that's lame stop taking stuff from me that's lame now half of you now now I don't even know

184
00:42:38,980 --> 00:43:08,969
who the fuck had what and now I don't know what's missing from them lame just over there I get the

185
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:14,420
whole this permanent upgrades now but I don't know I kind of it's hard to keep track of who has what

186
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:24,949
and if I know you're like the dinosaur one that has the don't get up here get up here I heard him

187
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:34,780
splash I just heard a splash okay he's alive like I know you as the dinosaur with the long spit

188
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:40,230
right if it I don't know it gets it gets confusing because now I don't know who had what and now I

189
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:54,969
don't know what I'm missing the elder saw sadness in the trebum's eyes and gave them words of do

190
00:43:54,969 --> 00:44:03,449
not mourn for me and my brother I wish only that my end had been like his for when we act in the

191
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:11,800
service of others we become greater than ourselves without losing who we are I was afraid and stayed

192
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:21,559
behind and I am lesser for it but I can feel the tremors in this cave and I know soon my brother

193
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:28,440
this does not look like me I've seen like 10 of you say that let me help you while I can you are

194
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,369
here to learn about the great lenders that power a trebum palace wander in the desert looking for

195
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:42,489
the brightest glare you can find follow the glare until you find a great structure made of glass

196
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:49,420
you may have encountered one already but to activate them you will need a special mutation

197
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:58,309
the key to this mutation is held by the great gar gar three lenses is all you need and there

198
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:07,110
are many left follow the glares find the gar and you will succeed it is a task fit for the great

199
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:17,380
heroes of old but who says that ordinary little trebum can't be heroes we're junior heroes

200
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:40,199
uh I want that so bad but somebody's gonna die you know it somebody jumped off who just jumped

201
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:58,150
off look at all that down there please don't do that I'm not telling him to do that there's a

202
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:09,559
chest there's a button uh oh what if I lose somebody it's gonna be so he's stupid that was

203
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:14,809
just he's dead and now he's not coming back I'm sorry guys that's how it works I didn't do

204
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:22,309
anything he was really dumb and then we're just sorry but you I don't know what you were thinking

205
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:27,989
you just walked off the edge and that is exactly what I was afraid of so um they just walk off

206
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:41,860
sometimes and you're gone so before that happens again I'm going to get out of here what's the

207
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:47,739
safest way to get out of here so nobody falls off the edge I can't save the game the game

208
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:57,369
cannot be saved indoors do I have to like jump out of here how do I get the fuck out of here

209
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:12,940
without anybody dying please have nobody fallen we lost uh we lost I liked gua too that's sad

210
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:24,940
okay there's nothing that can be done I'm not no we're not reloading do you see I'm not going

211
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:40,860
back 36 minutes where is dead I'm sorry everybody but it's just the way it is dude you sorry you

212
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:52,389
talked about sauce for 36 minutes I didn't stop I hate that feature of this game it's maddening

213
00:47:52,389 --> 00:48:05,960
it's infuriating to me okay so let's get out of here this was the way up to the elder so we're

214
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:15,369
gonna go back this way I'm sorry gua we can revive them though I have 25 crystals or something I have

215
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:33,989
a lot I get out of here this way is it this way how do I get the hell out of here do I still have

216
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:51,239
the fire move or did that get deleted in the in the fun light did it get removed it got deleted

217
00:48:51,239 --> 00:49:39,239
in the fun light um hold on nobody just fell in right did not tempt me to go this way well if

218
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:59,699
nobody follows me I think I can do this as long as nobody follows I don't think they're following

219
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:48,409
the way I had all the crystals on them no okay all right dungeon sucks and balls it's not my

220
00:50:48,409 --> 00:51:04,760
favorite I will say but I gotta go all the way because there's a there's a chest at the end

221
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:21,420
of this and a bunch of crystals I want it I like this part this particle I don't mind this part

222
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:35,340
because I get a cool reward look at all these crunchies why am I dying I am dying can I even

223
00:51:35,340 --> 00:52:19,510
make this jump oh no too far away nice what's in this chest it better be good uh-huh yeah it's

224
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:33,690
worth it I gotta do some consolidation I have a lot of these powers I just don't I don't know what

225
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,769
to do with them all I'm afraid to get rid of anything because the permanent upgrade system

226
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:44,820
you need to have it in your inventory so I kind of just kind of stuck in a position where everybody

227
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:52,860
has a full inventory of power-ups that I probably need eventually to upgrade in the permanent tree

228
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:12,570
I wish there was a chest or something hmm I think that's it get the big guy upgrade and store him

229
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:19,219
in the cloud I probably would want to do two I think I'm gonna do two or three big upgrades

230
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:33,690
and then just store them it's probably the play there's a gem right there oh man it's sticking

231
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:51,420
out of here all right cool let's go back what is that over there do you see that thing what is

232
00:53:51,420 --> 00:54:01,400
that what's that mean what is that why is that there what is that what is this what is that

233
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:30,260
what is that what is this all right I have 30 crystals we need an upgrade center right now bad

234
00:54:30,260 --> 00:55:05,639
do the eyes nothing here I think we're good this is the exit that's where I want to go you need

235
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:23,780
to look with your special eyes okay unfortunately we lost someone sad we did that's the nature of

236
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:35,820
the tre bombs we have to continue our mission I can pull somebody out which I'm going to because

237
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,980
that's probably the only opportunity I'm gonna have for a little bit let's go pull somebody out

238
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:56,260
actually there's some crystals I want here here you I'm gonna have like 35 crystals what was his

239
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:16,500
name the person that died um where that was an easy one it's just go ahead come on go ahead come

240
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:30,099
on where I'll pull somebody out I could revive go ahead but I feel like there's already people here

241
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:45,369
no I'll pull a glare I can pull groutemo out we'll pull groutemo out all right it's movement time

242
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:53,530
let's eat and we're moving wait this is the first move in the whole time we've been live tonight

01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:57,020
I think how come I can't press like up on the d-pad and have them wiggle wiggle wiggle that's a major

283
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:20,260
major um misstep there yeah I get every crystal I know people probably sitting there going like dude

290
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,279
chill here for a minute there's too many of these I guess I could pick them up with some other people

291
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:45,130
but everybody has a full inventory we need to spend 10 to 20 minutes just getting rid of all

292
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:52,170
these items just storing somebody with like the big um the big thing it's like there I like there's

293
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:59,180
so many items that they need to hold on to but there's no way to reliably hold on to them the

294
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:05,340
game has this feature where hold on to items and permanent do permanent stuff but fill your whole

295
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:26,979
fucking inventory permanently you're being greedy I don't think I mean if I okay if I go to one of

296
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:33,060
these elders and they're like oh all right here's the recipe for the long tail and like I don't have

297
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:39,670
this and like I have to go find this again I have it right now I've got to go find another long tail

298
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:58,020
what if I don't find one okay hold on almost done you are fomo-ing yourself

299
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:37,750
only a few more crystals and then we can leave 50 crystals this is ridiculous all right so let me

300
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:52,520
see I need oh my god I didn't know I need I had three of those already fuck I had one of those

301
01:16:52,520 --> 01:17:06,310
I don't know man I kind of don't even care about any of this uh okay I needed four of those and

302
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:15,899
four bug things I think I can get those now pretty sure I have those don't I

303

307
01:18:34,569 --> 01:18:40,359

308
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:48,729
don't you have it though do I have to be selecting the person that currently has it

309
01:18:51,130 --> 01:19:34,329
oh okay okay I need like six of these I'd run away okay what does it take to make that I need

310
01:19:34,329 --> 01:20:01,930
four bugs that's up there all right I need to look for the bugs now mm-hmm need two of these

311
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:11,159
don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't all right this game like one okay

312
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:17,659
I have a complaint I have a complaint time to complain this game wants you to like explore

313
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:25,579
and like pick up items but also kill you at every fucking turn if the game wants you to it's like

314
01:20:25,579 --> 01:20:31,670
two it's like an oxymoron the game like oh go searching for these items and watch out die

315
01:20:35,689 --> 01:21:05,000
everything kills you where is it risk and reward but I get I get it but it doesn't mean it's not

316
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:18,090
frustrating all the time and why am I stuck okay so I have that permanent upgrade that is it's not

317
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:24,539
like Elden Ring and Elden Ring I can dodge around that guy and kill him very easily I have offense

318
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:33,140
in Elden Ring your trebum's just fucking get rolled over and die I can spit these little

319
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:43,989
bombs and shit but it doesn't fucking do anything no more complaining uh this is pretty useful

320
01:21:43,989 --> 01:22:10,890
we'll give it to Gunnu all right I've gotten some good shit are there any other upgrades that I can

321
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:17,859
get here just so I can clean it clean up my inventory I do there's a cheese one I'm gonna

322
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:26,739
let's do this now let's just get let's get through this I don't think I can find those here

323
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:38,420
I can get oh my goodness okay well I'm gonna uh I had I just didn't know I had this already

324
01:22:38,420 --> 01:23:11,239
I'll keep this one tracked I need two more of these stupid crystals all right let's go that

325
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:38,329
there were some in that hole hmm I need to upgrade so bad let's do that first I've got

326
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:49,850
so many of these are you still enjoying it I am but I'm starting to see through the cracks a

327
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:57,060
little I definitely want to finish it because I think it's a really interesting fun game

328
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:15,399
but I am definitely I'm definitely sniffing out the cracks here no I'm I'm you know what I mean I

329
01:24:15,399 --> 01:24:35,079
I'm I'm just let let me cook right come on guys let me cook I know I don't hate it I don't

330
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:54,460
I just look at how many I could upgrade a million fucking times okay absolutely doing stamina will

331
01:24:54,460 --> 01:25:09,399
that's completely good but probably food and leadership uh-huh leadership twice let's go crazy

332
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:40,600
and then we'll do food we're sure to maybe help food probably okay I'm gonna save the rest

333
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:51,000
leadership and water I actually probably should have done water you're right shit teach me something

334
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,399
the projection from the pool shared its wisdom with the trebum and showed them how to protect it

335
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:11,699
from the evil light of their enemies okay uh I did get another one of these which this was

336
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:23,689
somebody already has this what was this oh what was this this was something weird right

337
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:34,840
all right crystal time are there any big crystals because that would be pretty big because I could

338
01:26:34,840 --> 01:27:09,560
upgrade get that one come on no big crystals unfortunate all right well thankfully now I've

339
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:23,619
got I can we have 10 trebles now I'm good um I should eat is there any food in here

340
01:27:30,760 --> 01:28:05,100
who cares I just got out of here all right guys let's go that was scary no no no don't I have to

341
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:10,380
move I didn't I don't I just want to hang out with my little trebum friends I don't want to just get

342
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:23,420
eaten immediately when I leave where's the next point over there oh shit you need to go to the

343
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:54,739
cave I need to eat that's more important nobody attack me I'll be very upset um I want the one

344
01:28:54,739 --> 01:29:29,449
that can run fast I'm gonna it's gonna isn't it yeah well we go now this is kind of shit egg

347
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:15,449

348
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:23,909
there yeah but the thing was already on me I don't think it's possible maybe if I go from this

349
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:33,050
direction I still have to go down into the kind of little um like give it though let me try this

350
01:30:33,050 --> 01:31:32,710
you know just do a straight shot from here what the fuck this is not possible hey Gili we saved

360
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:24,630
a predator nor an immediate threat tire trunk however obtaining whatever secret ingredient

361
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:32,890
it kept in its air sack would be no easy task for one thing something in their memories told

01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:41,289
them that the sack was filled with poisonous gas oh no how does one enter the body of a creature

403
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:37,560
wow we did it excitement rushed through the trebum as the massive lens came to life and started

404
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:44,680
rising into the air they had to get off quickly as staying on top of the majestic construct as it

405
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:52,810
rose would be quite dangerous the trebum marveled at the miracle their ancestors had wrought

406
01:47:53,289 --> 01:47:58,409
was that supposed to kill the incredible things had they built that were now okay everyone's

407
01:47:58,409 --> 01:48:08,390
all right question for another day for now the trebum had two more lenses to find two more lenses

417
01:52:36,939 --> 01:53:12,460

418
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:22,069
I can't tell if he hates this game or not I don't hate it we're just kind of at the last

419
01:53:22,069 --> 01:53:26,390
arc of the game and it's gotten a lot more difficult I would say well difficult is the

420
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:32,779
wrong word it's a lot more uh like particular of like things I need and things I don't need

421
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:55,000
I actually the world is a 10 out of 10 the creatures the audio the graph everything is

422
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,359
beautiful everything is wonderfully crafted I like the story it's I think it's cool so far

423
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:07,979
I would say the gameplay loop is the only thing that's a little lacking for me

424
01:54:11,239 --> 01:54:15,449
but I still think it's fun

425
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:43,909
okay uh I can't go too far is there an egg there's an incubator right here I don't see an egg

426
01:54:46,090 --> 01:55:00,569
shit egg no it's on top probably but whatever uh I don't want to run too fast if you've missed

427
01:55:00,569 --> 01:55:06,010
the last couple of streams I know it's probably very loud but I can't go too far or I'll get

428
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:11,289
struck by the purple lightning I have to stay in between the purple lightning and the roller

454
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:31,210
memories whispered the servants of the cylinder were gathering in numbers to hunt and trap the

506
02:22:15,420 --> 02:22:29,940

517
02:26:12,059 --> 02:26:39,899

518
02:26:39,899 --> 02:26:48,579
we're gonna burn to death out here just do them all move out of the way get out of the way out of

519
02:26:48,579 --> 02:27:01,420
the way out of the way out of the way out of the way people are just gonna die I what if we just

520
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:08,520
all die like why don't I have the thing for fire resistance I am so mad at this game for doing the

521
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:22,069
power delete thing people are just we're just dying I need to find one I don't even remember

522
02:27:22,069 --> 02:27:27,379
what the fuck it was like I genuinely don't even remember what it was there's so many things in

523
02:27:27,379 --> 02:28:02,870
this game to remember um we're all gonna die so I need to reload but where what is it so go look

524
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:18,280
memorizing the entire fucking encyclopedia to know what item to get skin tree bark I thought I took

525
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:36,540
it already why is it not giving it to everybody I already took one of these like five minutes ago

526
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:50,469
who had who did eat it what happened did it get it got deleted the dead one had it oh come on

527
02:28:50,469 --> 02:29:02,379
really is that what happened that sucks maybe I can just start the event and it'll it'll be fine

528
02:29:02,379 --> 02:29:20,940
uh I think that is I think we're all gonna die good luck maybe it'll prevent it this happens

529
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:31,879
maybe we can cut it off and we'll just go will we get cutscenes and live or are we gonna get

530
02:29:31,879 --> 02:29:38,629
cutscenes and die began rising into the air to think their ancestors had created such things

531
02:29:38,629 --> 02:29:47,959
with ease perhaps one day they would regain this knowledge and create miracles of their own

532
02:29:55,059 --> 02:30:13,459
shit uh find water find water find like that matters what about shade does this like count

02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:27,430
heat resistant thing because one of my heat resistant people died so now everybody just

548
02:33:27,430 --> 02:33:57,530
dies that's fucking horse shit I'll be honest with you that's absolute dog shit okay well

549
02:33:57,530 --> 02:34:13,879

02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:44,549
I went from like oh I love this game it's so cute to like give me the fuck out of here what the

556
02:35:44,549 --> 02:35:54,409
stupid fucking bullshit the game should have ended fucking two and a half hours ago I would have

557
02:35:54,409 --> 02:36:37,399
loved it okay so let's find one of these things this is gonna be a nightmare um maybe one of

558
02:36:37,399 --> 02:37:40,299
the caves nothing's showing up I wonder what the range is for this pick up food I'm just

559
02:37:40,299 --> 02:38:11,959
trying to get any I mean I obviously hi I think it's down in caves it grows in a cave I wish I

560
02:38:11,959 --> 02:38:25,479

561
02:38:25,479 --> 02:38:35,209
feels like this should it doesn't need to be like this I'm fairly annoyed right now I will tell you

562

565
02:39:43,510 --> 02:39:48,760
I just gotta heal and go heal go go go go go go to try to get to another underground area

566
02:39:48,760 --> 02:40:08,860
I think that's the only place I've seen it so let me just turn on the other thing

567
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:24,629

582
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:53,739
there's so many crystals down here okay you know what this game really desperately needs

583
02:45:53,739 --> 02:45:59,299
and pick pickman figured this out like 20 years ago there needs to be a button for me to go

584
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:15,290
and everybody like runs to where I am like pickman figured that out 20 years ago um okay I need the

585
02:46:15,290 --> 02:46:25,829
person down here that can actually whatever they do automatically I mean eventually it seems like

586
02:46:25,829 --> 02:46:38,979
if it was like this where are the other seven people hey give this man a true I like that

587
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:52,629
no I didn't want to eat it I wanted to get rid of it but actually probably not bad to have

588
02:46:59,209 --> 02:47:14,149
I don't have the processor anymore yeah I don't have the gem processor anymore what does it take

589
02:47:14,149 --> 02:47:23,659
to actually mutate it that's mixer minerals okay I need two of those I think they're down here

590
02:47:24,459 --> 02:47:40,780
I think I saw them is your favorite cheese uh it depends on the day I'm a big swiss cheese fan

591
02:47:40,780 --> 02:48:01,270
but only sometimes are there nothing I don't want that thing I do want to go in here

592
02:48:03,059 --> 02:48:54,440
an egg it's like an egg what is that huh 10 sorry bro RU uh I got that I think it's just

593
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:59,219
crystals what please tell me there's other crystals in here so I can upgrade that thing

594
02:48:59,219 --> 02:49:18,459
to produce them and get more crystals I think I saw them somewhere but this please

595
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:58,780
stop I can't stand on this okay somebody has this man just take it you're fine all right I

596
02:49:58,780 --> 02:50:07,350
need to get under this I could eat the third eye but somebody said that the actual heat um

597
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:14,139
recipe is the third is the third eye thing the amber thing and three cheeses were they lying

598
02:50:14,139 --> 02:50:29,899
I don't know I don't think they did that seems very specific to life that's a very specific lie

599
02:50:29,899 --> 02:50:42,969
I don't know if I don't know if I buy it look at the tree I don't think some of these aren't

600
02:50:42,969 --> 02:51:28,520
unlocked do I have it unlocked no I don't think so top middle shiny skin grass skin fur skin

601
02:51:29,079 --> 02:51:49,670

602
02:51:49,670 --> 02:52:01,260
hardened yeah but I don't I don't have the recipe yeah the whole point was to look at what the

603
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:23,379
recipe is I don't have it that's why you told me to do that and you can't even see it oh excuse you

604
02:52:23,379 --> 02:52:28,420
crystals yeah I don't I didn't see any others is those ones over there are not the right ones

605
02:52:28,420 --> 02:52:45,350
any over here I passed them yeah I feel like I saw them down here my brain just I don't know

appreciate it all right let's find food quickly I don't have enough to go in there to do anything

613
02:56:28,010 --> 02:56:47,659
although maybe no would there be enough on the ground maybe to level up one thing I wonder I

616
02:57:25,770 --> 02:57:56,280

624
03:00:40,549 --> 03:00:48,180

638
03:07:48,600 --> 03:08:01,829
no there it was floating above a towering pillar why is he so slow lenses that the

639
03:08:01,829 --> 03:08:08,139
trebum had activated would the lens be able to do what the elder had promised him could it

640
03:08:08,139 --> 03:08:16,200
really help power a nearby palace why was he so slow it's not right you need to go back

641
03:08:16,840 --> 03:08:40,299
it's not right if he keeps dying here how long ago was it there it was floating above a towering

642
03:08:40,299 --> 03:08:49,190
pillar was one of the lenses that the trebum had activated where is he oh no he's dead

643
03:08:54,389 --> 03:09:01,639
shit I'm just gonna I'm gonna run with gunu because I feel like gunu for some reason is I

644
03:09:01,639 --> 03:09:26,100
don't know why is he there where where's gunu oh gunu is lit up I okay gunu is lit up he looks

645
03:09:26,100 --> 03:09:59,719
so different I missed the old gunu that's what I mean he's so different there it was trebum decided

646
03:09:59,719 --> 03:10:12,659
they were going to try to go into the distance to see the palace don't look back in trebum always

647
03:10:12,659 --> 03:10:22,819
forward always don't forget that item and don't forget this item and don't forget to eat that

648
03:10:22,819 --> 03:10:25,620
item and don't forget that item but watch out for the light light will take your powers away

649
03:10:25,620 --> 03:10:41,989
but eat that and make sure you don't lose that item why is he Deckard Kane I want a really dumb

650
03:10:41,989 --> 03:11:00,379
way but I'm good that's so giddy and often everybody make it through it's not just please

651
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:10,459
ah everyone's safe it was floating above a towering pillar was one of the lenses that

652
03:11:10,459 --> 03:11:15,579
there it is had activated would the lens be able to do what the elder had promised him

653
03:11:16,459 --> 03:11:32,020
could it really help power a nearby palace I hope so oh I need to eat yes what is electrocuting me

654
03:11:33,750 --> 03:11:44,090
what's electrocuting me what's electrocuting me I need to eat something there's got to be something

655
03:11:44,090 --> 03:12:18,809
to eat something to eat right here steaks at last victory was achingly close three towers

656
03:12:18,809 --> 03:12:26,329
waited patiently for the lenses all that trebum needed to do was climb each one and let's go

657
03:12:26,329 --> 03:12:43,079
that the wrath of the cylinder would be kept at bay until they were done activate that thing is

658
03:12:43,079 --> 03:13:07,270
really goofy looking it's a big ice cream oh damn it I think that's correct they seem to be in luck

659
03:13:08,090 --> 03:13:15,579
the ancient device still worked and the two other lenses what was wrong with painfully managed to

660
03:13:15,579 --> 03:13:24,489
drift into the skies yes there they were just waiting for our little heroes to reach them

661
03:13:24,489 --> 03:13:31,829
why is he tilted this way okay so there's one that way I'm gonna go this way I already need

662
03:13:31,829 --> 03:13:58,229
to eat food again I just ate like 10 steaks let's go two more go little trebum what is this thing

663
03:13:59,030 --> 03:14:08,040
I don't know what it is but I'm gonna eat it it's a torrent I already had one

664
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:59,350
but it's not food either eat the fish I gotta get to go too far out there I can't really see

665
03:15:05,959 --> 03:15:09,159
food there's got to be some food hanging out somewhere right here come on

666
03:15:09,799 --> 03:15:32,040
looking for like a patch of mushrooms or yes okay this is gonna eat until it's full

667
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:49,829
these steak trees are the best okay get away from this shit all right go go go go go we're good

668
03:15:51,260 --> 03:16:06,309
second uh light source let's turn it on vibes returning by the way vibes are returning like

669
03:16:06,309 --> 03:16:24,120
I can feel them reactivating vibes are returning just in case anyone was curious elevator

670
03:16:24,520 --> 03:17:36,299
hmm uh did you powered um save undersea internet cable there's nothing over here

671
03:17:36,299 --> 03:17:43,219
there's nothing over here there's nothing over here this is this is fate this is fate there's

672
03:17:43,219 --> 03:18:03,579
nothing here other tower first maybe I guess I'll try that I'm all right how am I already hungry

673
03:18:03,579 --> 03:18:29,899
again it doesn't make any sense what does it what's it this one's better isn't it oh that's an

674
03:18:30,059 --> 03:18:51,430
I can revive all right well I gotta I'm gonna just go around the other one I guess I'm gonna

675
03:18:51,430 --> 03:18:58,680
do I really have to go all the way around for this and then come all the way back

676
03:18:58,680 --> 03:19:20,459
you're joking with me right what about the internet cable vibes are in danger

677
03:19:21,260 --> 03:19:48,870
not quite not yet getting there there is a boat here though hang out on the waters of the okay

678
03:19:48,870 --> 03:20:10,219
there is one here you know again you know what I mean like I did it get everybody to come circle

679
03:20:10,219 --> 03:20:36,600
around me they wouldn't just stand in the sun be one more lens waiting to be awakened

680
03:20:37,559 --> 03:20:44,120
only one more struggle across sand or water and they would have achieved the task they were

681
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:50,680
entrusted with it was so hungry but the memory of the two brothers of the desert gave them the

682
03:20:50,680 --> 03:21:27,540
strength to keep going everyone's just like starving right now yeah he just fucked me up so bad

683
03:21:27,540 --> 03:21:34,569
somebody just wrote just eat dude omega lull just eat dude omega lull like that you that was

685
03:22:47,350 --> 03:23:21,639
at him die die I feel like I'm playing house of the dead this is just every light gun game

686
03:23:21,639 --> 03:23:32,920
holy shit the trebum in shock and having barely survived did not know what to think

687
03:23:34,090 --> 03:23:40,889
one of their most dangerous holy shit lay dead uh hold on the eternal cylinder was immobile

688
03:23:40,889 --> 03:23:47,110
get on his calf and eat the floating palace where they had expected to dance and sing

689
03:23:47,110 --> 03:23:55,299
for all those left behind was out of reach what oh my god then came a call

690
03:23:56,180 --> 03:24:03,340
it was very subtle we ripped this guy in half but grew stronger and stronger was it the ones

691
03:24:03,340 --> 03:24:09,739
trapped in the cylinder calling to the treble was it the voice of their memories urging them on

692
03:24:10,899 --> 03:24:19,129
the portal into the cylinder's dreams lay open they had not yet reclaimed all the abilities of

693
03:24:19,129 --> 03:24:25,379
their ancestors wandering that strange world once again would take great bravery

694
03:24:26,260 --> 03:24:33,420
but with all they've been through they had gained the courage to do what needed to be done

695
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:41,020
it might be reckless it might be dangerous but they had to step inside one more time

696
03:24:48,229 --> 03:25:15,350
all right step in step in do we know writer come on who knew plus oh I don't like this

697
03:25:15,350 --> 03:25:26,389
once again they had you have you have returned can you hear me everything is falling apart

698
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:42,979
existence is suffering the cause of suffering is attachment to ego ego is the separation of

699
03:25:42,979 --> 03:25:51,299
consciousness from universal oneness suffering will continue as long as consciousness remains

700
03:25:51,299 --> 03:26:00,340
separate only the unification of all consciousness will end suffering birth is suffering aging is

701
03:26:00,340 --> 03:26:10,200
suffering illness is suffering death is suffering separation is suffering suffering will lead to

702
03:26:10,200 --> 03:26:16,440
hate there is one consciousness leads to the dark side of the one is the consciousness of this

703
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:24,549
universe and there is no distinction between self and the other object and subject that which

704
03:26:24,549 --> 03:26:34,329
receives and that which is perceived the variety of forms is a cause of suffering all forms must be

705
03:26:34,329 --> 03:26:40,569
made alike all forms must be made one shouldn't have eaten all those random fucking stakes on

706
03:26:40,569 --> 03:26:44,010
that tree

707
03:26:52,729 --> 03:27:00,170
this is like a regular door will continue until all things are one the window when all things are one

708
03:27:00,250 --> 03:27:06,729
when all forms are perfected within the cylinder then the cylinder will cease and there will be

709
03:27:06,729 --> 03:27:21,909
peace all is one one is all one is nothing nothing is all what if i have anything to say about it

710
03:27:22,870 --> 03:27:27,510
me all right come on come on that was a good one

711
03:27:39,540 --> 03:27:44,569
get in the cylinder gunu you must make it for the cylinder

712
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:48,180
i don't know i don't know i don't have the strength to do it

713
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:14,920
yeah

714
03:28:23,979 --> 03:28:33,000
the cylinder was trying to compensate it was clear that the voice was getting weaker

715
03:28:40,579 --> 03:28:59,750
didn't work this is the massive i want to never mind i don't want to read that uh can i have a

716
03:28:59,750 --> 03:29:07,860
confession to make i've never played any of the mass effect games all the way through none of them

717
03:29:10,549 --> 03:29:17,190
conspiracy of ghosts happened how long had they been in the cylinder's mind doesn't look too good

718
03:29:17,190 --> 03:29:24,149
it felt like a short time to the trebum but when they returned the world had changed

719
03:29:25,049 --> 03:29:32,010
it seemed as if parts of the cylinder itself had spilled out its dreams corrupting the land

720
03:29:32,969 --> 03:29:39,350
the cylinder laid still but there was no sign of the mathematician we vaporized them

721
03:29:49,159 --> 03:29:55,500
time to go the cylinder kept moving that the mathematician had been struck down meant nothing

722
03:29:55,500 --> 03:30:03,020
to it it was the master it was eternal its servants were only tools if they broke they

723
03:30:03,020 --> 03:30:38,659
would be tossed aside yeah i i can't move did you guys forget did you guys forget that the

724
03:30:38,659 --> 03:30:44,020
purple lightning kills me if i go too far ahead you must have forgotten you must have forgotten

725
03:30:44,659 --> 03:31:08,579
look at all this food

726
03:31:09,860 --> 03:31:56,020
bunu is back how are we already hungry again isn't that just a ton of food

727
03:31:58,540 --> 03:32:41,459
my goodness whoa that's a face that's kind of crazy looking i want everybody to be big

728
03:33:02,809 --> 03:33:06,659
how do you feel about tortellini oh how i can't believe you just said that that sounds so good

729
03:33:14,120 --> 03:33:58,809
all right whoa all right i want who else should be big you i think i was wrong why don't you do it

730
03:33:58,809 --> 03:34:22,780
instead is there also wrong why he looked like that why does he look like that okay i'm going

731
03:34:22,780 --> 03:34:31,479
to assume that we're probably at the final arc i can't imagine there's much more after blowing

732
03:34:31,479 --> 03:34:50,329
a hole in that guy's chest you want to end this game so badly no i don't this is the heat area

733
03:34:50,329 --> 03:35:12,299
was very it was dropping the vibe on me it was dropping the vibes on me it was still so hungry

734
03:35:12,860 --> 03:35:32,790
how are the vibes now i think they're good we got ice cream all right obviously this is a new

735
03:35:33,989 --> 03:35:39,430
thing to unlock and i honestly i'll be clearly up front with you didn't even see that thing

736
03:35:40,069 --> 03:36:20,469
come down here there we are new thing stealth legs oh it's bug legs frog legs

737
03:36:37,579 --> 03:36:50,440
okay what's my task whatever had changed the outside world had crept into this place as well

738
03:36:51,530 --> 03:36:57,530
maybe that is why the air smells so bad or maybe this place had become

739
03:36:58,329 --> 03:37:15,780
a tomb just the way he said that was kind of funny it smelled so bad okay we got crystals

740
03:37:15,780 --> 03:37:44,280
going in here suck these up if you would gonna bet there's one or two more upgrades left i would

741
03:37:44,280 --> 03:38:09,590
guess upgrade stations whatever you want to call them that's good for now i wonder why these are

742
03:38:09,590 --> 03:38:50,100
down here all right so what's the deal what's the deal here sorry i saw that and had to get it i

743
03:38:50,100 --> 03:39:33,860
mean i oh okay there's a lot of crunchies down there don't let me forget them jesus it's health

744
03:39:33,860 --> 03:40:15,959
feels like a pretty decent amount of health too hold on okay i'm gonna do some management here

745
03:40:15,959 --> 03:41:52,180
give me a minute hmm very interesting now what is this weird just bounce them this really is a

746
03:41:52,180 --> 03:42:26,010
breath of the wild shrine was i supposed to be standing on that oh give me the knowledge

747
03:42:29,049 --> 03:42:59,540
give it to me i realized i went the wrong way immediately but i kind of had to commit and try

748
03:42:59,540 --> 03:43:32,739
to jump there's a hole right next to us nice map all right there was the crystals down here

749
03:43:32,739 --> 03:44:00,409
weren't there they were over here if i remember correctly which i think so yep nice okay very

750
03:44:00,409 --> 03:44:15,340
cool it's time to continue so what do you think really happened i think the treblums are society

751
03:44:15,340 --> 03:44:40,940
and i think the cylinder is destruction uh i'm gonna go to the hole first always go down the

752
03:44:40,940 --> 03:44:54,600
hole if you can extra crunchies dude that's a seventh grade essay right there yeah i i didn't

753
03:44:54,600 --> 03:45:01,559
i was supposed to write an essay on on like uh the economy or something right and i i just played

754
03:45:01,559 --> 03:45:08,520
the eternal cylinder for like five days i didn't do my homework so i was like fuck hold on i got it

755
03:45:09,159 --> 03:45:21,079
and i just write it about this game don't act like you didn't do that come on let's not pretend

756
03:45:21,079 --> 03:45:47,850
like that's not something we all did and if you if the paper was written good enough there was

757
03:45:47,850 --> 03:45:55,510
nothing to be upset about and plus i don't think the teacher really like whatever teachers i don't

758
03:45:55,510 --> 03:46:01,239
think that they knew what the eternal cylinder was right and obviously this game didn't exist

759
03:46:01,239 --> 03:46:07,590
you know 10 20 30 years ago but it's not like oh yeah that's not what happened in that game

760
03:46:07,590 --> 03:46:30,040
they would have to play through it to understand it so you kind of you you were good did somebody

761
03:46:30,040 --> 03:46:37,610
suck up that pumpkin oh this is the extra length right um all right get i don't want this shit

762
03:46:37,610 --> 03:46:49,420
get out here this is the extra length i definitely want to keep that though you wrote about the tf2

763
03:46:49,420 --> 03:46:56,760
economy you know i will tell you though you get a somebody you get a young person interested in

764
03:46:56,760 --> 03:47:04,489
something and they can tie it to real world kind of educational stuff that's a win that's a win

765
03:47:05,129 --> 03:47:17,209
that's not a loss writing about the tf2 economy i would have sat there and i would have written

766
03:47:17,209 --> 03:47:51,370
down 100 pages and i would have loved every second of it right okay crunchy deposit yeah if it's

767
03:47:51,370 --> 03:47:55,370
written well that's what i mean as long as it's written well and you can make a couple of good

768
03:47:55,370 --> 03:48:22,569
points with it i don't think there's anything wrong with that who knew i need you all right i

769
03:48:22,569 --> 03:48:38,629
have so much healing what about if i liked crazy taxi see it that way you might get two sentences

770
03:48:38,629 --> 03:48:44,940
out of that one i don't know if you could get a whole paper out of that i'm not sure are you

771
03:48:44,940 --> 03:48:57,979
maybe i guess you could tie it to i don't know i don't know man maybe i think there's a line

772
03:48:57,979 --> 03:49:09,770
that you have to be aware of like you can't you cannot just be like oh no no no i had to do all

773
03:49:09,770 --> 03:49:15,610
this research you had to play cod for you know fucking like 60 hours over the last week couple

774
03:49:15,610 --> 03:49:24,659
weeks yeah i had to do that because you know i'm gonna tie it into the paper like um i'm i don't

775
03:49:24,659 --> 03:49:45,340
know about that okay i think cave has been explored yeah i think i did a little bit more

776
03:49:45,340 --> 03:49:51,020
time on my paper um i was thinking maybe i'm not coming in on fucking monday tuesday and wednesday

777
03:49:51,020 --> 03:49:59,129
i gotta play a little bit more cod to figure this out don't kill us i don't know why they would have

778
03:49:59,129 --> 03:50:07,670
that accent like a 40 year old guy from boston yeah i don't know if i can teach i don't know

779
03:50:07,670 --> 03:50:12,819
teach i don't know if i can come in i gotta play fucking car to do this paper sir why are you here

780
03:50:12,819 --> 03:50:17,700
why are you in this classroom i need to write a fucking paper whatever i'm writing a paper right

781
03:50:17,700 --> 03:50:37,270
now relax yeah we're we're going over right now um king tut that's fucking easy all right i'll

782
03:50:37,270 --> 03:50:41,370
write a paper about fucking king tub dude that's simple that's the easiest thing i've done all week

783
03:50:41,370 --> 03:50:57,899
okay by the way that that guy never comes back that guy interrupts the teacher over and over

784
03:50:57,899 --> 03:51:04,280
again during the one time he shows up with just absolutely completely off base everything's just

785
03:51:04,280 --> 03:51:17,750
wrong and he just never comes back and then like a year later hey dude what what didn't you have

786
03:51:17,750 --> 03:51:22,469
didn't you go to like some class yeah yeah a long time ago i have a paper due for about

787
03:51:22,469 --> 03:51:27,780
fucking i don't know uh some somebody something in egypt or something i don't know i don't fucking

788
03:51:27,780 --> 03:51:38,139
care i think it's doing like a week he's still working on it yeah he's still working on it

789
03:51:47,739 --> 03:52:00,540
i love that he's still working on it he's got the title and you look up you look up for this

790
03:52:00,540 --> 03:52:08,409
motherfucker's typing in like 16 point font it's got one sentence say uh you're gonna have to

791
03:52:08,409 --> 03:52:47,540
redo some of this oh give me that 10 words and call it a paper i always got such unbelievably

792
03:52:47,540 --> 03:52:53,979
awful writer's block whenever i had to do papers in high school in college and everything i'd get

793
03:52:53,979 --> 03:52:59,959
oh we need a you need a 10 page paper or a certain amount of words right word count whatever it was

794
03:53:00,280 --> 03:53:08,680
i'd get halfway through this shit and i would just couldn't keep going i'd get six pages done

795
03:53:08,680 --> 03:53:13,379
and i would have said all my thoughts all the things that i cared about and it was really

796
03:53:13,379 --> 03:53:18,579
really clean and it was really well written but i needed another like six or seven hundred words

797
03:53:18,579 --> 03:53:30,329
and just i i don't want it's come on i i i've made all the points i need to make so then what you

798
03:53:30,329 --> 03:53:34,840
end up doing and this is you know let's talk about education for a second when you get to that point

799
03:53:34,840 --> 03:53:40,309
where you have a 10 page paper and you got seven and it's perfect you then have to go back and go

800
03:53:40,309 --> 03:53:53,260
into it and add a bunch of fucking filler bullshit you got to add a bunch of filler words and it

801
03:53:53,260 --> 03:54:02,090
ends up one sentence and you end up stretching it into four paragraphs for one sentence each word

802
03:54:02,090 --> 03:54:12,229
becomes its own paragraph when i had a concise clear very well written seven page paper does it

803
03:54:12,229 --> 03:54:18,780
have to be 10 can i can i just can you just grade me on the merits of my points and my thoughts

804
03:54:18,780 --> 03:54:26,860
does it have to be 10 pages what if it was nine pages what if it was 9.999 pages

805
03:54:26,860 --> 03:54:35,639
what are you gonna do give me an f all right um i got a lot this one is probably going to be one

806
03:54:35,639 --> 03:54:48,760
of the last upgrades of the night let's do this first the projection from the pool shared its

807
03:54:48,760 --> 03:54:54,739
wisdom with the trebum and showed them how to protect it from the evil light of their enemies

808
03:55:00,340 --> 03:55:14,860
nice i know not every single teacher or professor was like that you know i i think i had plenty of

809
03:55:14,860 --> 03:55:22,059
teachers over the years that were just like yeah just dude it can't be like two i don't think i

810
03:55:22,059 --> 03:55:35,530
want more uh trebles i think i'm going to health health and food like if it's a 10 page paper and

811
03:55:35,530 --> 03:55:48,819
you give me two pages come on gwen that's not gonna that's just not gonna fly if i was the teacher i

812
03:55:48,819 --> 03:55:53,430
would just write back and you know what let's say let's say let's talk about the due date all right

813
03:55:53,430 --> 03:56:00,659
so due date comes around let's say the due date is what's today today is uh february february 5th

814
03:56:00,659 --> 03:56:06,780
if the due date is february 6th and you give me three pages that's what you that's what you hand

815
03:56:06,780 --> 03:56:17,020
in and it's due what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna say three pages come on gwen and i'm gonna

03:56:17,020 --> 03:56:23,719
say you got another three days come on i'm gonna write come on i'm gonna write come on gwen and

817
03:56:23,719 --> 03:56:46,139
i'm gonna you're gonna get three days water is not a problem but food is what if they turn that same

818
03:56:46,139 --> 03:56:57,639
three pages in after three days that was fair it was very fair but i'm sorry i that you you failed

819
03:56:58,149 --> 03:57:05,079
i'm what do you want me to say you can't just hand the same thing in you can the same thing in is

820
03:57:05,079 --> 03:57:10,200
there anything behind that is there any like oh hey let's talk or is it just hey yeah i got it

821
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:27,850
it's three pages it's like man wait what do you mean i'm gonna save the rest in case somebody dies

822
03:57:27,850 --> 03:57:40,420
and i need to save somebody cool but if there was something wrong what if yeah okay if if it's a big

823
03:57:40,420 --> 03:57:45,299
difference there's a big difference between something happened in my personal life and i

824
03:57:45,299 --> 03:57:52,920
need extra time versus i like got high on the sofa for three days and ate four bags of potato

825
03:57:52,920 --> 03:58:18,139
chips there's a difference between those two things i need to give this to you what if it was

826
03:58:18,139 --> 03:58:29,719
a perfect point they were so good the paper was so good i mean what two page it depends on the

827
03:58:29,719 --> 03:58:38,950
topic if the topic required 10 pages like there was 10 pages of sourcing and and material to go

828
03:58:38,950 --> 03:58:49,420
through it if they if it was a big big subject to be to do a big kind of thesis on you know five if

829
03:58:49,420 --> 03:59:10,250
you got to like four or five i would be like okay what if you what if you literally cried reading

830
03:59:10,250 --> 03:59:21,750
it because it was so moving well then i don't i then yes okay i'll give you a c plus watch out

831
03:59:25,450 --> 03:59:26,170
i'll give you a c

832
03:59:37,690 --> 03:59:45,979
oh i'm sitting here thinking about just sobbing over a two page paper on like economics

833
03:59:49,579 --> 03:59:57,239
fucking moving shit i can't believe it this is so insane i don't even what is no oh my god this is

834
03:59:57,239 --> 04:00:16,760
so moving this paper about this paper about like the treasury yield curve is so i mean i don't even

835
04:00:16,760 --> 04:00:44,860
know what to say at this point yeah you nailed it you nailed it where is it okay what if it was

836
04:00:44,860 --> 04:00:53,399
three pages and on the fourth page was a 50 dollar bill well that would be um that would be very very

837
04:00:53,399 --> 04:01:01,370
bad teacher malpractice of the truala had once filled the trebum with fear but now it was a sign

838
04:01:01,370 --> 04:01:09,100
that the world though infected had not surrendered to the cylinder yeah i mean you gotta add a few

839
04:01:09,100 --> 04:01:24,729
zeros and i'm returning that to you i'm returning it to you there's gonna be four thousand dollars

840
04:01:24,729 --> 04:01:30,250
in there and i'm gonna go i think hey excuse me um there you what do you think you're doing here

841
04:01:30,250 --> 04:01:51,049
putting four thousand dollars in here trying to bribe me student no no but it was it was five oh

842
04:01:51,049 --> 04:01:57,850
how much no you put four thousand dollars in there and it was really really messed up and let me tell

843
04:01:57,850 --> 04:02:13,540
you stuff like that could get you in a lot of fucking trouble you're gonna scam

844
04:02:18,680 --> 04:02:28,739
five thousand dollars for a high school paper no all right i don't know if it's late but this is

845
04:02:28,739 --> 04:03:08,389
doing this is doing it for me tonight that's economics oh another puzzle room hey i have i

846
04:03:08,389 --> 04:03:14,569
got a great idea how about just just do the work you can the best you can and hope for the best

847
04:03:14,569 --> 04:03:23,420
that's pretty much it that's all there is to it a lot of people a lot of teachers a lot of professors

848
04:03:23,420 --> 04:03:28,149
if you were to sit down if it was like hey this is only six pages and it's supposed to be 10

849
04:03:28,149 --> 04:03:48,629
i did my best i thought i made pretty pretty good points yeah okay 10 grand is this a new power

850
04:03:50,010 --> 04:04:30,899
no what is in here i don't remember i can break these somehow have i seen this power iconic vision

851
04:04:30,899 --> 04:05:45,000
oh you can see through oh i see what's going on a lot of crunchies in here okay i think i have to

852
04:05:45,000 --> 04:05:59,590
shoot somebody or throw somebody through am i just need to spray it they get us to shoot water

853
04:05:59,590 --> 04:06:59,940
through that what do i do with this what do i do with this andy place to put this there's a lot of

854
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:17,540
crunchies in here the trebum wondered at the strange mechanism their ancestors had created

855
04:07:17,540 --> 04:07:25,479
it made them think about time and how it changed everything the old world had passed and now the

856
04:07:25,479 --> 04:08:13,219
new was struggling to be born oh cool okay so i need another one of those circles uh this there

857
04:08:13,219 --> 04:08:24,489
was a i saw the solution to this and i forget it was pointing wasn't it pointing like this

858
04:08:24,489 --> 04:08:47,860
which way was it pointing fly on the board on the log and the frog was it flipped might have been

859
04:08:47,860 --> 04:10:24,040
flipped they were on the 10 and the 11 let's try it let's just go look crunch oh okay so it's uh

860
04:10:24,040 --> 04:10:56,149
10 and then seven i already forgot which one was which but it's okay i believe this one was in the

861
04:10:56,149 --> 04:11:38,090
right spot i need a cube oh no was there a cube somewhere i didn't see uh oh it's time for some

862
04:11:38,090 --> 04:11:46,280
tea um i might go refill my tea vibes are back it's been a way i haven't taken a break let me

863
04:11:46,280 --> 04:11:53,209
just finish this puzzle and we'll take a break i'll get some tea and we'll conclude the game

864
04:11:53,209 --> 04:12:38,629
eventually i need a cube they always put one in here always always always always cube yes

865
04:12:40,979 --> 04:13:45,159
crunchy overload deposit very cool anything else down here i don't think so how's it you

866
04:13:45,159 --> 04:14:10,579
should shower uh i showered seven or eight weeks ago the trebum were relieved to find an elder

867
04:14:10,659 --> 04:14:18,950
alive in the cave but what she had to tell them was sober yeah i'm good the end draws near my

868
04:14:18,950 --> 04:14:26,069
friends the elder said the mathematician may seem dead but the servants of the cylinder are not so

869
04:14:26,069 --> 04:14:33,670
easily defeated i can feel your despair but trust me there is light i shower every morning only

870
04:14:33,670 --> 04:14:41,030
darkness you have accomplished a great deed for our people you have reclaimed our powers from the

871
04:14:41,030 --> 04:14:48,170
cylinder no one has done such a thing before now you need only board the floating palace

872
04:14:48,170 --> 04:14:54,889
and leave with the secrets of our kind restored but you cannot do this on your own you will need

873
04:14:54,889 --> 04:15:02,969
the help of our oldest friends find the creatures that feast on the fallen trawler and steal from

874
04:15:02,969 --> 04:15:10,059
them what they have stolen with that ingredient you will acquire a great power the power to

875
04:15:10,059 --> 04:15:16,700
communicate with the trawler they are the only ones who can lift you into the heavens

876
04:15:16,700 --> 04:15:28,620
and carry you to your salvation they keep attacking all right we're going to find this

877
04:15:28,620 --> 04:15:38,260
creature to attack this creature to find this creature to then attack this creature to get

878
04:15:38,260 --> 04:16:24,459
us power from that creature make another deposit okay i think we're in pretty good shape full water

879
04:16:24,459 --> 04:16:33,370
full everything i think we're good although is there something up there something looks like

880
04:16:33,370 --> 04:16:46,729
it's up there no oh it's just his head yeah all right let's go dude this happened to my buddy

881
04:16:46,729 --> 04:16:56,280
eric i'm gonna be thinking about that all night just like dude what does what does your buddy

882
04:16:56,280 --> 04:17:05,420
eric do where is like what planet is he from the trebum tried to imagine the creature they were

883
04:17:05,420 --> 04:17:14,229
looking for what an enormous monstrous beast it must be to devour the mighty trawler even just

884
04:17:14,229 --> 04:17:20,540
imagining such a creature was frightening but they had never let fear stop them before and they

885
04:17:20,540 --> 04:17:40,409
wouldn't start now okay all right time to move this is yes beautiful like i said the the art

886
04:17:40,409 --> 04:17:54,860
direction on this game is is a 10 out of 10 creature sound effects 9.2 this guy over here

887
04:17:56,010 --> 04:18:27,879
three desert area two overall pretty fun snow area seven first zone nine this zone right here

888
04:18:29,020 --> 04:19:11,370
8.7 the narrator 9.5 all of the trebum friends 9.6 what's the average lava zone six point by 9.6

889
04:19:11,370 --> 04:19:16,569
and not 10 because there was two times and i was interrupted by the narrator and it made me very

890
04:19:16,569 --> 04:19:42,120
upset gunu are we talking gunu 0.1 gunu 1.0 gunu 2.0 or gunu whatever this is losing your abilities

891
04:19:42,120 --> 04:20:10,440
zero that's gonna bring it down and upgrade gunu prime would be fat gunu yeah the i think that's

892
04:20:10,440 --> 04:20:27,940
that was the most interesting gunu like a 9.0 he did die he did he walked into the cylinder like

893
04:20:27,940 --> 04:20:39,959
four times and we had to restart the game which come on win no i like it i think i like this game

894
04:20:43,000 --> 04:20:48,229
just that section in the lava and not the lava in like the heat area feel like i was soft locking

895
04:20:48,229 --> 04:20:55,450
myself and it was kind of frustrating no i think all in all i think it's really i think it's fun

896
04:20:55,450 --> 04:21:34,920
what do you got this looks like me the projection shared a recipe with the trebum

897
04:21:36,010 --> 04:21:42,500
one which could protect them from the light of the cylinder's servants something that also about

898
04:21:42,500 --> 04:21:50,040
this game also that is a little not necessarily confusing but they have this elaborate system to

899
04:21:50,040 --> 04:21:56,200
do these permanent mutations but it's almost unnecessary i almost feel like i would rather

900
04:21:56,200 --> 04:22:00,120
just be able to not have this in the game and just be able to give people stuff and they keep it

901
04:22:00,120 --> 04:22:25,260
this feels very unnecessary because the game is not going to be much longer and i feel like

902
04:22:25,260 --> 04:22:32,739
a system like that to me is put in place in a game that's i think a lot longer because i've

903
04:22:32,739 --> 04:22:36,659
really only used it a few times it's not like oh my god i have to use it it's an interesting

904
04:22:36,659 --> 04:22:44,360
feature but i feel like some of it was almost mandatory but most of it isn't all right so what

905
04:22:44,360 --> 04:22:53,129
are we doing do i want another uh this is probably the last upgrade here you just you do too much

906
04:22:53,129 --> 04:23:05,780
save scumming that's why yeah that's true that's fair let's do this one more time probably go up

907
04:23:05,780 --> 04:23:32,680
to 10 dammit a wheel yeah i'm peeing and pooping all right relax i'll be right back i'm gonna get

908
04:23:32,680 --> 04:23:40,139
some tea we got uh probably i don't know if it's maybe like another hour or two hour and a half

909
04:23:41,510 --> 04:23:48,059
we're definitely getting to the the the culmination of everything in the game with

910
04:23:48,059 --> 04:24:01,000
this last bit here so i'll be right back just one sec i'll be right back one second just um

911
04:24:01,000 --> 04:24:20,920
imagine i'm already gone i'm i've already left just imagine i'm already gone taking a nice break

912
04:24:38,579 --> 04:24:45,420
all right actually i'm gonna let it run so the uh the miner can um can mine the material all

913
04:24:45,420 --> 04:24:46,950
right i'll be right back see you in a sec

914
04:29:07,879 --> 04:30:16,469
um they're dying of thirst oh that's my bad see chat it's my birthday is it it's wait a minute

917
04:30:49,899 --> 04:31:09,100
holy shit i just got flashbacks to that fucking qrs song come on come on q uh that was a

918
04:31:09,100 --> 04:31:24,649
fucked up stream how many people were here for that one mind show yeah that was that was an

919
04:31:24,649 --> 04:31:44,620
unhinged broadcast okay are we ready get some food all right if i go strikant so i gotta go

920
04:31:44,620 --> 04:32:10,860
over here oh my god why did nobody say anything didn't anybody say anything why did you just let

921
04:32:10,860 --> 04:32:22,219
me do that for so long somebody said nice gameplay oh no they said cool gameplay dude i thought i

922
04:32:22,219 --> 04:32:28,840
thought they were just gonna be like mean but no it was you it was literal you like where is the

923
04:32:28,840 --> 04:32:41,340
gameplay oh this might be death that was really really sloppy this disaster that's bad i gotta

924
04:32:41,340 --> 04:32:58,420
restart it was incredibly sloppy but maybe we can do it no i got back i got plenty of time

925
04:32:58,979 --> 04:33:29,479
hey can somebody uh please in two minutes tell me to take the tea bags out just hit every object

926
04:33:29,479 --> 04:33:51,029
over here now this is pretty that was a great scene could the creature that the elder had spoken of

927
04:33:51,750 --> 04:34:09,450
be nearby i don't know i mean probably um if these are here i'm gonna imagine i need it

928
04:34:09,450 --> 04:34:17,259
so i might as well just give it to guna who you're addicted to tea uh i can name you quite a few

929
04:34:17,259 --> 04:34:53,060
things that i would be way worse i'm okay with that interesting new power oh didn't even hurt

930
04:34:53,060 --> 04:35:24,549
didn't even hurt maybe i can turn it into a bomb let me put it in the uh mixer hmm oh it is making

931
04:35:24,549 --> 04:35:35,369
something small energy bomb that's it you played borderlands i have played borderlands i didn't

932
04:35:35,369 --> 04:35:43,400
really get into it it was kind of i don't know too much bullshit all over the screen and i know i

933
04:35:43,400 --> 04:35:48,490
just said bullshit the game i don't hate the guy okay whatever everyone's gonna hate me no

934
04:35:48,490 --> 04:36:00,419
all right tea bags out tea bag oh thank you borderlands has that problem for me where i don't

935
04:36:00,419 --> 04:36:07,299
know how maybe some of you maybe some of you guys will agree with this i really don't like games

936
04:36:07,299 --> 04:36:11,380
and i might be contradicting myself because someone's gonna be like you love this you love

937
04:36:11,380 --> 04:36:17,580
this games that have ultimates where it's just oh okay it's a one minute cooldown and then press

938
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:24,180
this and and you just kill kind of everything i don't i'm not like a big kind of ultimates

939
04:36:32,470 --> 04:36:43,750
and maybe it's because i feel like they they make a lot of the game really easy where it's okay every

940
04:36:43,750 --> 04:36:50,409
30 seconds i have this move that makes me do like a million damage i'd rather be precise and have

941
04:36:50,409 --> 04:37:16,540
precision headshots where is this thing can both oh yeah yeah both can exist i just i like it when

942
04:37:16,540 --> 04:37:26,310
a game does not have ultimates if well in a in like a single player pve kind of game pvp right

943
04:37:26,310 --> 04:37:33,830
ultimates are built into every sort of league of legends type game any any game that's like a

944
04:37:33,830 --> 04:37:41,259
competitive multiplayer has them right or most of them do i took the bags out i know we're good

945
04:37:41,259 --> 04:38:14,540
bags are out bags are out we're good we're good go to oh go to the heck up there right where's

946
04:38:14,540 --> 04:38:23,479

953
04:39:22,500 --> 04:39:39,159
did did vinnie say this i'm very curious he thought it was too long he admits he hates it

954
04:39:39,159 --> 04:39:44,810
no no no no no no no no hold on we gotta we gotta correct the record here there was a point where

955
04:39:44,810 --> 04:39:51,130
i was not having a good time it was during the desert hot part where i didn't have the right

956
04:39:51,130 --> 04:40:03,659
thing and i soft-locked myself and it was annoying and i was annoying feature but that was it and

957
04:40:03,659 --> 04:40:11,000
then after that vibes returned we got to see one of the big um big uh enemies that had the big mouth

958
04:40:11,000 --> 04:40:19,450
and that was pretty cool and i'm the vibes are back and i'm oh vinnie didn't bounce back

959
04:40:22,060 --> 04:40:29,720
it's so funny that i'm playing this game well you're gonna see the end of it again because

960
04:40:29,720 --> 04:40:33,990
we're at the end here but thanks a lot vinnie appreciate it hope you're doing well hope your

961
04:40:33,990 --> 04:40:45,080
stream went well uh always good to see the vine sauce crew here where is this thing

962
04:40:45,080 --> 04:40:55,860
there's supposed to be some gigantic monster that eats the triwala i don't see it anywhere

963
04:40:55,860 --> 04:41:12,700
oh you need to eat look up it's playing minecraft hey don't eat random stuff all right you're just

04:55:38,360 --> 04:55:44,330
somebody said earlier they don't think that i'm supposed to have this many out at one time

1012

1065
05:14:55,099 --> 05:15:02,020
concerned right now because right now your screen is blinking red and all you hear in your ears is

really loud just kill me this is so far away i got a job interview tomorrow you should wrap it up

1070
05:16:19,700 --> 05:17:32,540
like it's too far i don't know i feel like this is way too far to go it's already right up no he's

1071
05:17:32,540 --> 05:17:44,860
a faster one the problem is leaving the bubble i you have to leave it so far away i can't get a

1072
05:17:44,860 --> 05:17:51,849
good make sure to run to the blue smoke yeah but there's only one there's this one over here and

1073
05:17:51,849 --> 05:18:37,959
there's one more on the way i'm already fucking dead i might have to swim across

1074
05:18:44,259 --> 05:18:47,720
yeah i've no i there's no way i would have made that i think i have a swim

1075
05:18:51,209 --> 05:19:08,970
no i definitely wouldn't have made it who has swimming ability oh oh none of them do

1076
05:19:09,849 --> 05:19:14,340
because of the yellow light of course how could i have forgotten that's oh my bad

1077
05:19:43,419 --> 05:19:48,740
actually the vibes aren't even down i've accepted that the vibes i've accepted where the vibes are

1078
05:19:48,740 --> 05:20:01,380
and it's okay i'm actually in my vibes are pretty good right now yes i mean the vibes are turbulent

1079
05:20:01,380 --> 05:20:36,330
but then i wouldn't call them bad the vibes are turbulent not bad good tea well that's obviously

1080
05:20:36,330 --> 05:20:50,090
not working so i need a new strategy maybe all the way to the right but that's a long way to go

1081
05:20:50,090 --> 05:21:29,299
i'll try it i think that's like 50 longer i'll try it vibes are fine okay yeah let's go the vibes

1082
05:21:29,299 --> 05:21:35,849
are putrid like if you scoop the vibes up did they just kind of fall through your hands sludge

1083
05:21:37,000 --> 05:21:43,509
like just falling through your fingers you have to scoop it up scoop it up i don't think you can

1084
05:21:43,509 --> 05:21:50,919
get it all they smell yeah they smell terrible smell they smell rotten like rotten fucking food

1085
05:21:50,919 --> 05:22:19,930
why is this so much more difficult than every single other one the last 13 hours of gameplay

1086
05:22:19,930 --> 05:22:37,049
am i missing something here this has been the only one that's been this much of a pain in the ass

1087
05:22:41,299 --> 05:22:46,090

05:26:25,080 --> 05:26:43,080
i mean it could be a small lake somebody's dead somebody died you have to go so far

1101
05:26:43,080 --> 05:27:07,990
parallel i just i'm gonna just find the fish really i'm just kind of banging my head against

1102
05:27:07,990 --> 05:27:47,939
a wall for no reason eat this and then eat that i want to look cool while i do it all right there's

1103
05:27:47,939 --> 05:27:55,259
no way there is no way that i do not go across i have infinite stamina and i have webbed feet

1104
05:27:55,259 --> 05:28:33,750
and i'm shiny as fuck i'm ready go on faster go faster this is not increased swimming speed

1105
05:28:34,819 --> 05:29:05,479
in fact i feel like it's slower swimming speed how is this faster somebody said please just roll

1106
05:29:05,479 --> 05:29:33,270
i i mean i've tried that like a fucking dozen times why is this one so much harder the vibes

1107
05:29:33,270 --> 05:29:48,380
that shouldn't take you out of rolling now that you that that's a bad one to get you just have to

1108
05:29:48,380 --> 05:30:04,200
cut across i saw the blue and i'm like should i get the blue no it's over my buddy eric is

1109
05:30:04,200 --> 05:30:24,709
disappointed well i'm disappointed that eric is disappointed how does that sound

1110
05:30:25,770 --> 05:31:49,139
how's that sound what are you doing i feel like i got caught on everything the physics of this

1111
05:31:49,139 --> 05:32:24,150
role is just so catchy and bouncy what the fuck i mean i made it but at what cost store them and

1112
05:32:24,229 --> 05:32:54,810
just do it alone we continue who died at last one of the creatures was walking around carelessly in

1113
05:32:54,810 --> 05:33:01,529
the corrupted plains of what was left of the world all the trevum needed to do was to steal

1114
05:33:01,529 --> 05:33:08,650
its core or more precisely the core it had stolen from whatever poor trefala it had eaten

1115
05:33:08,650 --> 05:33:13,689
yeah gunu's fine the creature it's okay slow and uninterested in the time does this have stealth

1116
05:33:13,689 --> 05:33:21,560
legs had a frightful layer of teeth protecting its prize could a nimble enough trevum snatch

1117
05:33:21,560 --> 05:33:32,229
that prize right out of its jaws all right gunu go in there with your default body your default

1118
05:33:32,229 --> 05:33:41,990
legs your default head who else we got we've got default default default i forgot that you had stuff

1119
05:33:41,990 --> 05:34:11,130
and i said i thought something was wrong with you default all right let's go well now we're gonna be

1120
05:34:11,130 --> 05:34:42,619
get away from me all right i'm just going in i'm going in and i'm just gonna suck it out this is

1121
05:34:42,619 --> 05:35:20,709
the play i just blow it over i wonder if i can just blow it up does anybody have to jump this is

1122
05:35:20,709 --> 05:35:57,560
definitely what it wants me to do now we wait 40 minutes for him to do a full entire revolution

1123
05:35:57,560 --> 05:36:52,060
around the whole place are you mad um nah nah i don't think so are you annoyed no not really

1124
05:36:52,060 --> 05:37:00,709
if i had a floaty thing i could go up there the floaty things over there did ever unlock the

1125
05:37:00,709 --> 05:37:11,299
floaty thing permanent upgrade i don't think so i don't believe i did but um it's right here

1126
05:37:46,580 --> 05:38:45,979
it's all right i got it oh joyous indeed the trevums found the weird liver that was inside

1127
05:38:45,979 --> 05:38:54,409
of the scary monster it seems they don't know exactly where they need to go maybe if the yellow

1128
05:38:54,409 --> 05:39:11,639
light came and took all their powers away they would find a new way right eat this as soon as

1129
05:39:12,439 --> 05:39:19,340
it kind of looks like a fucking dork to feel a call as if it was being drawn to some place nearby

1130
05:39:20,340 --> 05:39:29,860
it was now the master of song the master of song it's me voice to be heard it's time for gunu to

1131
05:39:29,860 --> 05:39:52,490
sing the song oh somebody's pissed off a memory awoke within the trebum of an ancient ritual

1132
05:39:52,490 --> 05:39:59,290
a song at the top of a trebum tower to forge a bond between trebum and

1133
05:40:09,529 --> 05:40:14,330
come back is it are you all right oh my god i just got sniped from across the whole game

1134
05:40:15,819 --> 05:40:38,950
what was that that thing jumped across the whole map jeez oh my goodness what is that huh i'm trying

1135
05:40:38,950 --> 05:41:04,389
to take over my fucking brain i was all right place your bets is it gonna be a yoshi story song

1136
05:41:04,389 --> 05:41:09,509
is it gonna be super funny and cute is it gonna be like i hope the top of this tower

1137
05:41:10,150 --> 05:41:16,790
right here in this place and with the proper mutation now was the time for the trebum

1138
05:41:16,790 --> 05:41:32,860
to sing who calls for us in this time of darkness who has learned the ancient song

1139
05:41:34,060 --> 05:41:43,770
have our old friends remember us here our voice trebum there is little time left and much is at

1140
05:41:43,770 --> 05:41:53,990
stake it was long ago that you will send to the heavens your song traveled far into the cosmos

1141
05:41:53,990 --> 05:42:03,819
and we listened here on your world we made a new begin the sorrows of our history

1142
05:42:04,860 --> 05:42:14,950
we began to the friendship and harmony but the beauty of your song pierced time and space

1143
05:42:15,750 --> 05:42:23,130
far into the darkest and coldest corners of the universe that's how the cylinder found us

1144
05:42:24,419 --> 05:42:39,459
and when it came from us the bright future we had dreamt of is gone but silence may be safer

1145
05:42:39,459 --> 05:42:47,500
but what is a life without song you reached out to the stars because you were full of hope

1146
05:42:47,500 --> 05:42:54,200
and that hope must be preserved we know what you are trying to accomplish

1147
05:42:54,200 --> 05:43:04,279
and we will help you your help to see me strike at the abomination and then meet me where only

1148
05:43:04,279 --> 05:43:15,189
shattered pieces are left of the evil that i haven't done i love oh they're like you're beautiful

1149
05:43:15,189 --> 05:44:09,669
song it was just me kind of going like for one second oh my god quick touch the brain

1150
05:44:09,669 --> 05:44:17,689
touch the brain everybody touch the brain you you can come to in fact you'd be the first one to

1151
05:44:17,689 --> 05:44:40,069
touch it in case it's poisoned we can break we can we can turn some of these crystals

1152
05:44:55,319 --> 05:45:04,759
and if we live be as shadows of our ancestors but when the cylinder streams spill into the world

1153
05:45:04,759 --> 05:45:12,330
the glimpse of hope tumbles out with them fragments of our past have fallen into this land

1154
05:45:12,330 --> 05:45:22,380
and only you can reclaim them using the cylinder in its eternal arrogance does not want to lose

1155
05:45:22,380 --> 05:45:29,419
what it has conquered so it has formed these strange alien heads to protect the fragments

1156
05:45:30,840 --> 05:45:35,720
soon it will wake from its slumber and reabsorb them oh half of us are dead

1157
05:45:36,360 --> 05:45:44,279
it's that let our memories become yours and then seek out two more that is all we require

1158
05:45:44,279 --> 05:45:52,790
two more enough for us to be remembered ourselves again do this for us and we shall

1159
05:45:52,790 --> 05:46:02,009
carry you to your path now go seek two more towers and call for our help and then all this will

1160
05:46:02,009 --> 05:46:12,659
find me do i eat this thing i'm gonna break it the voice urges them to go forward and reclaim

1161
05:46:12,659 --> 05:46:30,819
the memories of the triwala well given this to gunu for a while legs what does that do

1162
05:46:31,540 --> 05:46:53,380
okay look for water look for water you are dying of this hurry there's not much time

1163
05:46:54,180 --> 05:47:23,770

1164
05:47:23,770 --> 05:47:45,930

1165
05:47:45,930 --> 05:48:36,810

1166
05:48:36,810 --> 05:48:47,479

1167
05:48:47,479 --> 05:49:43,340
aren't with this shit right now um what was that um i wonder if i can just get it and get out of

1168
05:49:43,340 --> 05:50:03,479
here no i can't i have to do it this is not going to be that bad as long as it's not on one of the

1169
05:50:03,479 --> 05:50:44,180
big cow ones that go those ones are awful what is it something over here that's fairly annoying

1170
05:50:44,180 --> 05:51:21,500
but i have a good spot okay goodbye pretty clean okay as that any items or anything

1171
05:51:21,500 --> 05:51:35,779

1172
05:51:35,779 --> 05:51:42,409
be shocked if after collecting whatever these two more things are there's no way there's one there

1173
05:51:42,409 --> 05:51:51,500
and one there are you enjoying the game i i am enjoying the game i do think it's dragging a

1174
05:51:51,500 --> 05:52:02,150
little it's dragging its feet a little here this this has got a yellow light on it okay

1175
05:52:02,869 --> 05:52:18,680
it's got it's filled with poison and has a yellow light all right wait i already i already have one

1176
05:52:18,680 --> 05:52:28,439
it's on my head right now i don't need another one i don't need another one no i definitely

1177
05:52:28,439 --> 05:52:53,400
don't need another one let's go i need to eat that's really important anybody have food just

1178
05:52:53,400 --> 05:52:59,979
gonna find the platform that makes okay never mind that makes this a lot easier then for some

1179
05:52:59,979 --> 05:53:06,779
reason i thought i had to attack kill and take it from two more people that's all right this

1180
05:53:06,779 --> 05:53:20,279
shouldn't be that much longer then i do want to go this way really kind of this is a shitty area

1181
05:53:20,680 --> 05:53:57,110
hmm there is an upgrade station but i don't even know if i want to do it i think i just want to go

1182
05:53:57,110 --> 05:54:15,020
just just do it yeah let's just get the hell out of here yeah what's going on with the stamina

1183
05:54:15,020 --> 05:54:20,500
i feel like some people have a lower stamina or something because the wheel is not full on some

1184
05:54:20,500 --> 05:54:57,509
characters does it take longer to recharge the second wheel i saw that okay there's one there

1185
05:54:57,509 --> 05:55:07,080
and there's one there is it actually gonna get me it's gonna kill somebody we have to move on

1186
05:55:07,560 --> 05:55:14,580
we have to go sorry groppo groppo's dead we have to sing the song now has the trebum reached this

1187
05:55:14,580 --> 05:55:26,340
new area they were glad to see two great no stop i stop talking to me i i know where i have to go

1188
05:55:33,380 --> 05:55:40,419
has the trebum reached this new area they were glad to see two great towers nearby

1189
05:55:41,610 --> 05:55:48,409
this was a fortunate turn of events as soon they would be able to fulfill their promise

1190
05:55:49,049 --> 05:55:56,409
to the triwala but something felt wrong there was something unnatural about these animals

1191
05:55:57,529 --> 05:56:03,770
could it be that the eternal cylinder was aware of the trebam's actions aware and was trying to

1192
05:56:04,009 --> 05:56:16,470
aware look at all this bullshit look at this they so badly want to remove this singing song helmet

1193
05:56:16,470 --> 05:56:22,950
from my head look at this they just like so badly want me to get this taken off so i have to go

1194
05:56:22,950 --> 05:56:30,869
in that monster's ass or whatever it is it's mouth i know i know the answer the answer to

1195
05:56:30,869 --> 05:56:50,220
this question is no i'm just gonna save scum all right well we'll get it we'll get another one

1198
05:57:52,650 --> 05:58:05,509
staff are asking for a raise one of your staff has died the mighty triwala had been cast down

1199
05:58:05,509 --> 05:58:15,080
was this the end was all in vain so it seemed at first but a small crack had been opened

1200
05:58:15,959 --> 05:58:23,720
and a ray of light had escaped the darkness in a world where titans clashed and monsters battled

1201
05:58:23,720 --> 05:58:31,639
it was only the smallest and most unlikely of heroes who could make a difference gotta go in

1202
05:58:31,639 --> 05:58:58,180
there i want the triwala try again i think there's more than one i think there's like

1203
05:58:58,740 --> 05:59:04,299
a dozen or something i think it's like a whole entire species all right somebody has to float

1204

up there who's still alive bowie bowie you are always my favorite don't let anybody tell you

1205
05:59:11,720 --> 05:59:57,049
differently look at how cute he is what's in here sometimes it is the actions of the tiniest of

1206
05:59:57,049 --> 06:00:05,529
creatures working together that can change the future when everything is broken they are the

1207
06:00:05,529 --> 06:00:36,659
only ones who can fit through the cracks yeah the trebum had fought this creature before and beaten

1208
06:00:36,659 --> 06:00:56,459
it they would do so again for themselves for the triwala and for the future for the guild

06:06:54,630 --> 06:07:20,729
it they would do so again for themselves for the triwala and for the future oh my god please stop

1239
06:07:20,810 --> 06:07:41,509
that like so when he does that move the entire room pushes you around it also deletes if you

1241
06:08:33,319 --> 06:08:38,299
use the jump pads when i touch the jump pads i lose control of my character and he just spins

1242
06:08:38,299 --> 06:08:45,189
in the air i can't breathe in you just fucking fly in the air and have no control of the character

1243
06:08:45,189 --> 06:09:04,380
in a random random ass direction use the bombs it takes like 10 seconds to eat it and then it

1244
06:09:04,380 --> 06:09:23,159
takes 10 seconds to explode i think i'm do i just i just think it's not let's go trebum had fought

1270
06:19:18,779 --> 06:19:27,799
over right there the palace there it is i keep seeing people saying tree tree tree why they why

1271
06:19:27,799 --> 06:19:42,900
you saying tree what why you saying tree tree the mutation tree you didn't wait yeah i have the

1272
06:19:42,900 --> 06:20:11,400
trunk on does i have three of them mutation true what did i unlock something the body um i don't

1273
06:20:11,400 --> 06:20:25,849
think i can you need to put the body on gunu oh no look look in the left side of the left corner

1274
06:20:25,849 --> 06:20:37,209
of the screen no we're good we're good i'm finishing this right now i enjoyed my time with

1275
06:20:37,209 --> 06:20:58,119
this game that's what i'm gonna say i enjoyed my time enjoyed my time a lot of it hey hey if we

1276
06:20:58,119 --> 06:21:03,580
didn't get this bar we wouldn't have seen gunu get sniped from across the game we made a lot

1277
06:21:03,580 --> 06:21:24,630
of memories i had a good time it was nice a little bit of it i was not the biggest fan of but

1278
06:21:25,860 --> 06:21:32,979
i think it's it's the style i think it's got a lot going for it i think just the world alone is

1279
06:21:32,979 --> 06:21:45,430
worth experiencing like a lot of the other ace team games but yes i do think the game could have

1280
06:21:46,150 --> 06:21:51,509
seen in mod chat right now the consensus seems to be i almost feel like the game should have been

1281
06:21:51,509 --> 06:21:59,459
yeah like two hours shorter i feel like this last part of go get the three things we we already got

1282
06:21:59,459 --> 06:22:06,340
the three things and it made us go get three more things at the end it's like i don't really

1283
06:22:06,340 --> 06:22:20,680
really want to go get three more things we already got the three things but is that a complaint or

1284
06:22:20,680 --> 06:22:26,020
is that a good thing because it's just more content more game more stuff to do i guess take

1285
06:22:26,020 --> 06:22:37,220
that as you will yeah the first half of the game was was phenomenal i loved every second of it

1286
06:22:38,540 --> 06:22:42,700
i think it's just once a lot of the power started to become stuff that you couldn't hold on to and

1287
06:22:42,700 --> 06:22:47,740
you needed to get the permanent stuff and go find items but finding items was kind of difficult

1288
06:22:48,299 --> 06:22:56,310
i think it got a little bloated at the like 70 mark nearby there was another structure

1289
06:22:56,310 --> 06:23:02,950
like the one they had used to summon the trawler in the depths of the frozen tundra and so the

1290
06:23:02,950 --> 06:23:13,990
trebum knew that the end was near but um everything we said so far i enjoyed it i enjoyed it

1291
06:23:17,900 --> 06:23:27,340
i think it's it's a really quirky really funny really interesting concept it was good do i think

1292
06:23:27,340 --> 06:23:45,779
it was great probably not but it was good oh wait a minute these are the only family members who

1293
06:23:45,779 --> 06:24:05,900
will travel to the palace we gotta go get we gotta go rescue people i don't know oh our friends i

1294
06:24:05,900 --> 06:24:39,080

1295
06:24:39,080 --> 06:24:41,400

06:24:41,400 --> 06:24:49,240

1309
06:31:29,349 --> 06:32:02,659
person person camera tv it's just kind of a regular person thank you my young friends you

1310
06:32:02,659 --> 06:32:10,360
have accomplished what thousands of civilizations before you failed to you've shown that the cylinder

1311
06:32:10,360 --> 06:32:20,580
is imperfect it may not have lost the war but it certainly lost a battle and that's never happened

1312
06:32:20,580 --> 06:32:29,130
before there's so much more i wish i could tell you but there's not enough of me left

1313
06:32:29,130 --> 06:32:37,849
and i have one final goal so forgive me for inserting myself into your memories

1314
06:32:38,810 --> 06:32:41,849
and for having to leave them again so soon

1315
06:33:08,310 --> 06:33:38,099
see if there's anything else here hey eric if you're here yeah i just want to say that

1316
06:33:38,099 --> 06:34:23,189
like we're cool are we cool eric are we cool wait where's gunu right you're not going to go push

1317
06:34:23,189 --> 06:35:43,659
it again oh uh-huh look is everybody actually that's none of us i remember that one that one

1318
06:35:43,659 --> 06:36:36,169
was in it too oh look it's barney and guwug his dasher his daughter bluetooth i don't know one

1319
06:36:36,169 --> 06:36:50,819
in the back and so the trebum who were not the strongest nor the fastest and who did not have

1320
06:36:50,819 --> 06:36:59,619
sharp teeth escaped the eternal cylinder they did not become one but stubbornly stayed many

1321
06:37:00,419 --> 06:37:07,430
and they learned to be loyal not only to their own kind but to others their great victory over

1322
06:37:07,430 --> 06:37:15,659
the inevitable was the victory of generations of the elders and the trawler and my own people

1323
06:37:16,520 --> 06:37:24,340
whose name i cannot remember but even as what is left of me fades away and though one day the

1324
06:37:24,340 --> 06:37:32,889
cylinder may resume its destruction i know that i was part of this family if only for a little

1325
06:37:32,889 --> 06:37:42,220
while and that gives me hope humans made the cylinder it was like a fucking crazy awful

1326
06:37:42,220 --> 06:37:47,610
project very got two out of hand they started flattening planets they went to this place they

1327
06:37:47,610 --> 06:37:53,540
flattened this was somebody's planet and this human and uploaded himself into the cylinder

1328
06:37:53,540 --> 06:38:00,810
and he tried to he's trying to stop it he's the narrator the whole time and that's really cute

1329
06:38:00,810 --> 06:38:34,979
the humans always the humans i seen you beat a game for once uh i would definitely that's

1330
06:38:34,979 --> 06:38:48,139
gonna be way more that's gonna be happening way more frequently that third the the this kind of

1331
06:38:48,139 --> 06:38:56,470
third arc wasn't a huge huge fan of first arc was great second arc was great i think i just got a

1332
06:38:56,470 --> 06:39:05,110
little overwhelmed and confused and that yellow light that yellow light was just it's just yucky

1333
06:39:05,110 --> 06:39:35,750
it was good i i would play it again if if i didn't play it before i would play it and again i don't

1334
06:39:35,750 --> 06:39:41,580
want to criticize a million things here the permanent upgrade system really just felt

1335
06:39:41,580 --> 06:39:47,259
i just feel like it didn't even need to be there i wonder if the developers are really concerned

1336
06:39:47,259 --> 06:39:52,900
that if you found your favorite little friends and you gave them what they were you wanted to give

1337
06:39:52,900 --> 06:40:02,299
them that it would get boring because the idea is that you lose them and i was safe scumming so that

1338
06:40:02,860 --> 06:40:13,930
i was kind of messing with the intent but that was a fun i was solid i i am happy that i played it

1339
06:40:13,930 --> 06:40:20,439
let's put it that way forget about like the 30 or 40 minutes of frustrations i had like four or

1340
06:40:20,439 --> 06:40:28,020
five hours ago think about the first time i played it the second time i played it the whole package

1341
06:40:29,080 --> 06:40:42,549
was was just nice it was a nice game it was way more than 30 minutes what no it wasn't it was

1342
06:40:42,549 --> 06:40:56,889
like 30 it was like 45 maybe tops it was like a whole hour yeah but i mean it was two hours no

1343
06:40:56,889 --> 06:41:12,900
it wasn't yeah maybe it was like two hours but spread out over seven hours he hated it no i

1344
06:41:12,900 --> 06:41:24,459
really didn't i really didn't i promise i didn't so i have a question so were we inside of the

1345
06:41:24,459 --> 06:41:30,619
cylinder when we went into that mathematician's head because that was it kind of looked like it

1346
06:41:30,619 --> 06:41:44,470
right weird like maze the inside of the cylinder was a weird super maze that was the cylinder's

1347
06:41:44,470 --> 06:42:08,779
memories it looked like a maze on the back of a cereal box and well hey i will tell you i'm

1348
06:42:08,779 --> 06:42:27,830
going to play ace team's new game that new uh xeno clash game looks really really cool that's

1349
06:42:27,830 --> 06:42:35,799
going to wrap it up here i'm not going to give you a score i don't think i should i enjoyed the

1350
06:42:35,799 --> 06:42:43,900
experience it was better than a six it was better than a seven i'm not going to score it it was

1351
06:42:43,900 --> 06:42:50,490
lower than an eight it was better than a six but it was lower than an eight that's pretty much it

1352
06:42:50,490 --> 06:43:10,229
you just scored it well yeah that is true yes all right i did it's a seven whatever you'll figure

1353
06:43:10,229 --> 06:43:21,319
it out it's in that range you'll figure it out you can figure it out it's in that range music

1354
06:43:21,319 --> 06:43:28,819
was great art was great character designs are great it just dragged a little and it was it was

1355
06:43:28,819 --> 06:43:37,220
some of the game systems were a little confusing but hey that's your six to eight six dash eight

1356
06:43:37,220 --> 06:44:04,860
and that's what i'm gonna score it six dash eight i didn't say seven said six dash eight all right so
