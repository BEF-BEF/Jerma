1
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,670
Hey, what's up? Yeah, I know I'm late. Yeah, it's meh, well, not really.

2
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:36,969
Not really. Well, I was going to stream yesterday, but moved it to today.

3
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,219
It was going to be six o'clock at night, but reverse delayed after a delay to noon.

4
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:56,549
So you got both a delay and a reverse delay. My favorite econ. I appreciate that.

5
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:06,010
We should all play Valorant so I play it. A lot of people already play Valorant and I don't play it.

6
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,090
I'm definitely not going to play Valorant. I'm telling you right now.

7
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:26,900
Any shooter game that requires a ton of brain power to learn. Is Valorant a high brain power game?

8
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,540
Or no, people are going to laugh at me for saying that, aren't they?

9
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:39,180
Am I going to get laughed at for saying that? No? I mean, it feels like kind of a high brain

10
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:48,659
power game. You played TF2. I just told you a story a few days ago about how

11
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,180
I AFKed and spawned with the flog and ate chocolate until I fell asleep.

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,049
I don't think you can do that in Valorant. So I'm not so sure as some of these

13
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,939
some of these shooter games are for me. But anyways, hello. We're going to play more

14
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:15,530
Halls of Torment today. It's going to be a very short stream. I have to prepare.

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:24,889
A stir is coming to Vegas. So I'm going to spend some time. It could be really interesting. It's

16
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:33,610
been a while since being stirred. Spent some time hanging out. How short? Probably like two

17
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,889
or three hours. That's very short. But hey, let's hang out. I also plan on opening some crates

18
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,060
in Team Fortress today. I have a whole backpack full of keys and shit. I'm just like, do I? How

19
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,099
do I? What do I even do about this? So you're going to get a Halls of Torment, one or two

20
00:02:51,099 --> 00:03:00,969
Halls of Torment runs, and then a TF2 box opening stream. Welcome. Welcome to the new Jerma.

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, boy. He's going to just open crates for an hour and leave. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, this is this is

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:20,250
the end. This is the we're at the end. No, no, it's I just I have a lot of cases that are old.

23
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:28,650
I've got like winter, like 2020, like 2019, I think crates. I don't even know what's in them.

24
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:40,710
I've got, I don't know. I got 25 keys. When are you going to play viewfinder? Yeah. Winter cases,

25
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:48,389
omega low. Don't open. Are they bad? Should I not have gotten the winter cases? Well, I didn't get

26
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,689
any. I just have had them for like half a decade. The winter cases are dog shit. What? That's like

27
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:01,620
half the inventory, I think. Is that how I think that would be? Oh, well, you're okay. Well,

28
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,509
you're not even going to want to watch that part. The most expensive item you can get is five cents.

29
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:23,060
What on the marketplace? Oh, whatever. I got 25 keys. Okay, Tony Montana. I have guys I haven't

30
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:35,000
opened a TF2 box. As of like the last seven days. It's been almost. It's been like seven or eight

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,899
years. It's been a very long time. It's just I have a lot of these boxes in my inventory. I did

32
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:50,220
a full inventory cleanup. And you know what happens when you do an inventory cleanup in Team Fortress?

33
00:04:51,660 --> 00:05:00,680
You. Well, this is what I do. Each backpack slot is another class slot. So one is scout,

34
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,839
two is soldier, backpack slot, three is pyro, right? I like to keep it very organized. And when

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,439
I did that, I realized I had like 80 crates. I'm just like, what do I do with all these?

36
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,079
And then I was told, don't open all these ones because they're terrible. But I got war paint

37
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,240
cases. I've got cosmetic cases from the last five years. I don't know. I'll just open them.

38
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,579
Sort by type. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm terrified to click that button because there's

39
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,769
no undo. All right. Okay. Stop stalling. I'm going to be for like two, three hours. So no stalling,

40
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:37,430
no stalling. Yeah, no stalling. Let's go and play halls of torment for a little bit. And then we'll

41
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,750
play some TF2. Open it up some cases and crates. Play the game. I know, I know, I got to go. I know

42
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:53,209
I have to do it. I like this game. All right. So we left up halls of torment a few days ago.

43
00:05:53,209 --> 00:06:02,279
Give me all the loot for safekeeping. Wink, wink. It's kind of funny because I've, I know, go,

44
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:10,579
dude, go. You only got two hours. Go. But let me tell you a story. Hold on. Let me just get,

45
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:19,990
I've got 3000 gold. Yeah. All right. I want to refund all because I'm playing the burn character.

46
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,910
So we're gonna do some crazy shit with the burn character. Start talking about Diablo four.

47
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:35,079
I should give you guys my takes more often because I saw a few comments of people saying like,

48
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,680
oh man, like this is like one of the only things he's ever said that I like agree with.

49
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,410
Should I give you my takes more often instead of just, okay, the only takes you guys get from me

50
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:52,550
are like dog food flavors. And I'm just like fucking around, right? But like you never get

51
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,550
like a real take from me. So you can never get my real opinions on anything. So the only opinion

52
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,680
you do get from me are dog food. So that's why all of you think I'm, I'm like a psycho

53
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,829
because I never give you a real take. And the comedy takes I give are about eating dog food.

54
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:16,730
So I get it. I completely understand that now. All right. So this, this is the fire character.

55
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:34,680
He's so fake. I'm maxing this out. What do you think? Projectile size and attack speed.

56
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:53,019
I think that's fine. Dog food takes. Revives are pretty big too. Say something controversial,

57
00:07:53,019 --> 00:08:03,939
please. Um, no, I don't. What should I put the last one in damage, damage and defense?

58
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:17,860
What are your thoughts on the new Airbus? Like the new airplane? I don't know. Uh,

59
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,129
I'm actually going to take away regen and get movement speed with this character.

60
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,600
All right, cool. What do we have for items? Oh my God. He hates the Airbus.

61
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:39,500
What's so new about it? What does it, what does it do? You need to go on a rant, dude. Hey,

62
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:49,240
go on a rant. No, you don't want a rant. Like you don't want a bunch of takes from me. Trust me.

63
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:58,759
But back when Diablo two came out, what's a good item? I should dig. You don't know. You don't.

64
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:08,460
You really don't. I'm telling you. Three of you are going to go based and 10,000 of you are going

65
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:25,529
to go, what is it? What? Shut up. That's a good one. That's huge too. So this is 40% crit damage

66
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:33,909
and 10% base crit chance. That's cool. I remember getting those. Uh, we're going with this. I'm ready

67
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:43,049
to play one of my new favorites from 2023. I think I'm strong enough to try. Should I try to actually

68
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:52,179
beat the boss? You have an NA education? Yes, I do. What do you want to say? Yes. You want to deny

69
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:57,830
that? No, I don't. Shut up idiot. No, I don't. Yeah, I do. Yeah. I, I, I have a North American

70
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:10,019
education. Does that make you angry with me? All right. So I have auto attack on which holy

71
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:17,929
shit I am. I'm way stronger than I used to be. Okay. This is going great. We're going to do attack

72
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:36,009
speed. What was this doing before? Like 20 already leveled up twice. It's always damaged. WM one

73
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:45,980
gameplay. Yeah. Well, this is my favorite. It's probably my favorite character so far.

74
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Is it always movement speed or should I finally do pick up range and have the people that were

75
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,620
very mad at me last time that I didn't pick it up, pick it up? Time is moving too fast.

76
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:03,480
It's so fucked up that it's August of 2023. Why is it? What happened to 2020? Well, I think I can

77
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:11,990
explain what you're feeling. Uh, COVID deleted two years that COVID essentially just absolutely

78
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:19,220
liquidated two full years. That's why it feels like 2021 because 2020 and 2021 and some of 2022

79
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:32,779
barely even happened. So yeah, we time traveled from 2020 to 2023 in a lot of ways. Um, I don't

80
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,090
know what to do here. I'm doing pick up range. I know that is not great, but if somebody put

81
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:53,259
their hand through their monitor, but sorry, we should make a petition to petition to go revert

82
00:11:53,259 --> 00:12:02,600
back to 2021. That's kind of interesting. That's weird. Ladies and gentlemen, we have decided in

83
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Congress, we are going to be introducing the rewind time act, uh, myself and Senator Stevenson

84
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,200
over there thought it was a good idea to rewind time back to 2021 because COVID fucked up everything

85
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:41,289
for two years. You've already used two rewinds. We made up time anyways. Isn't there like a wild

86
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:47,639
theory that we're in the wrong year? I heard that somewhere that it's actually like,

87
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,669
it's not 2000. It's not like 2000. We're living in like the, like the 1400s or something,

88
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,809
right? Isn't that what I heard? Isn't that what you heard? I heard that. Did you hear that? Bro,

89
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:11,480
you talked about this already. No, I didn't. I heard that we very, we could be like way further

90
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:20,090
in the future or way earlier. You heard that theory? I probably heard this theory on a fucking

91
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:29,669
YouTube short that I scrolled by every time I opened up YouTube shorts. I just got to tell you,

92
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,059
I, I think I'm getting older. I'm getting a lot older. I can definitely feel myself growing up,

93
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:46,870
but I scroll through YouTube shorts and I just go, what is going on? What is happening? I'm like,

94
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:56,889
am I older? I'm too old now. I'm, I'm too old for this. What's happening? That's a cool theory.

95
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:12,970
I'm 22 and I feel that way. Go to the blood trail. I want to get strong first. Hold on. Dude,

96
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:21,190
you're crazy. I don't, I don't know. I don't think so. I will scroll through YouTube shorts

97
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:31,139
and I just kind of, I, after like 10, I just stop and then I go back up three. Cause I go,

98
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,659
there's no fucking way. That's what I just watched like a minute and a half ago. Is it?

99
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:45,320
And I give that person like five more views in a row. You know what I mean? It's just like,

100
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,240
no, there's no way that what I just watched was what I just watched. Oh, it was, was it?

101
00:14:50,039 --> 00:15:04,840
If you don't understand skibbidi toilet, you're fine. I've seen it. I've seen it. I watched it.

102
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:15,700
I don't think I saw the whole thing. These are all good. That's the one where the people with the

103
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,659
cameras for faces are like punching the people with the toilets, right? And it's,

104
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:29,480
they're like in a gigantic, there's like a big fight. Who told him? What do you mean who told

105
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:40,299
him? I saw it. And I was just like, oh, what the fuck is happening in this? Okay. Let me,

106
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:48,490
let me pay attention. He's becoming too advanced. I want the burn chance and no,

107
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,259
I'm not going to be playing this optimally. I know this is a good game for me to hang out

108
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,980
and just talk and chill, which is I like doing that. It's fun. So if I pick the wrong thing,

109
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:07,379
I'm just hanging out. We're just chilling. Don't worry. Zoomer humor. Enjoy your Andy.

110
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:17,159
I've made this statement before and it's very, very real. Oh yeah. Zoomer humor is,

111
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:25,720
is very, it's over very quickly. I brought up this very important point.

112
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,350
When you talk about zoomer humor, I can decide if I liked something in literally eight seconds.

113
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,509
Boomer humor, I might have to sit there for 30 minutes while they explain like a whole thing

114
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:41,830
and then tell it to me, like at the end of that. So it's like the one good thing for me about zoomer

115
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:50,100
humor is it's either good or it's not very quickly. So, but I do love that Boomer humor style where

116
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,500
you kind of have to tell a whole elaborate story, but one thing that might be kind of funny in the

117
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:07,529
middle. I very much enjoy the Boomer humor style, but zoomer humor is quick. It's to the point

118
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:19,829
and it gets going very quickly. I want health defense or let's do region. There's no setup.

119
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,150
Yeah. I like a big setup. I think that's pretty obvious if any of you have been here for long

120
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:32,660
enough. Honestly, the setup to me is a lot of times more fun than actually telling the joke

121
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:47,960
and sometimes way more fun. If you don't like to do Airbus, do you prefer the 747, the 787?

122
00:17:50,869 --> 00:18:04,809
I don't prefer, and I don't, I don't, sure. I don't have like an airplane preference.

123
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,420
Although I guess maybe the newer ones are just, they're outfitted better with

124
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:21,740
more amenities. I guess, I don't know. What do you mean what? I said the newer ones are outfitted

125
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:31,019
with more amenities. Is that, but wait, is it, you literally flew a plane. Definitely this. Wait,

126
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:46,970
probably the dragon's breath carried that entire time I got close. You did? No, I did. Me and Austin

127
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:58,299
show. I was on his flight show. That was really cool. That was a great time. How come you hate

128
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:10,440
the council of sorcery so much? I don't. Do you have a private jet? I feel like if I flew in a

129
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,990
private jet one time, it would be over. I would like probably wipe out my entire bank account,

130
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:35,259
everything. I don't think that's a good idea. That's probably a really bad idea. I don't even

131
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:41,700
know how much even is. Okay. If I were to take a private jet, a private plane, how much does it

132
00:19:41,700 --> 00:20:05,180
even cost? I don't even, I don't even know. It's $10,000 minimum. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I don't

133
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:26,009
think so. I don't think so. Not worth it. No, I don't, for me, I mean, I hate flying. I don't

134
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:33,480
like airplanes. I'm not afraid of flying. It's just the whole travel experience to me. It's like the

135
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,759
having to go through into the terminal and go through the security area and wait for everybody

136
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,880
to get on the plane and get on the plane and then sit there. And then it takes, it takes like three

137
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,579
hours to get on an airplane. Sometimes I hate it. I don't hate being in the air. I just, I just don't

138
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,809
like the whole prospect of the amount of time and how annoying it is to actually get into the plane

139
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:15,369
in the first place. Ooh. But is that worth like 9,000 extra dollars? Because even a first class

140
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:23,539
ticket on some of these airlines, that's already a huge premium on that seat. I don't think I would

141
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,180
want to pay like a thousand percent premium to get on like a private, I don't know. No,

142
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:39,460
no, you could afford it. I think a lot of you guys may be overestimating my finances a little.

143
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:47,019
Dude, bro, you can do it, dude. Just take a private plane everywhere you fucking go. It's only like

144
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:53,500
20 grand a flight. You got the money, you'll be fine. It's like, I think you guys may be

145
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:11,450
overestimating my financial ability to fly on a private plane all the time. What is it? I already

146
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:25,450
own all of these. You rented a baseball field. Yeah, that was for, that was for a stream that a

147
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:32,089
lot of time and a lot of energy went into. Me renting a baseball field out versus getting on

148
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:38,759
a private plane? That's, those are two very different things. Those are not even close.

149
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,769
I guess I'm just going to take it because I can deposit it because I don't have it yet, right?

150
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:59,960
This is physical attacks though. Do a private jet stream. No, no, I don't want to do that. No,

151
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:14,650
thank you. That whole stream is what? Just me flying on an airplane and reading a newspaper

152
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:26,660
and grabbing the sprite out of the flight attendant's hand. Just being like, thank you.

153
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:38,279
Thank you. That's it. That's the whole, that's all the content. Thank you. Thank you. And then

154
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:47,829
maybe like an hour goes by and I'm like, excuse me. Do you guys have headphones? Thank you.

155
00:23:48,470 --> 00:24:14,700
Regen. No, multi hit. Didn't bring your own headphones. Headphones is always, I just,

156
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:22,900
I don't really do. Okay. A lot of you here, headphones might be a very important accessory

157
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,250
you take everywhere. I do not. Headphones to me are something that has to be packed.

158
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:36,019
I never carry them. They're never on me. It's never, I don't really. Oh, I've got my earbuds

159
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:45,190
in or whatever. Not really. So headphones to me are not an object I carry on me frequently.

160
00:24:53,369 --> 00:25:06,170
You need to go down. Yep. Yep. We're just talking. All right. I'm going up. I don't want to deposit

161
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:24,200
this to the well yet because I might get a better item. Do you just sit and stare at a wall during

162
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:36,329
a plane ride? I mean, no, I'll, I'll do stuff on like tablets and stuff. Or sometimes, you know,

163
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:47,980
you get TV in front of you. Sometimes that's, that's fun. I'll load up. You know, it's great

164
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,539
on an airplane. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it. Is it what? Here's the

165
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:58,619
strat. You ready for the, are you ready for the strategy? If your plane ride is more than three

166
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:06,329
hours long or about two to three hours long, go play the curb your enthusiasm roulette. You go pick

167
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:11,180
three random curb or four random curb your enthusiasm episodes. It doesn't matter what

168
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,779
they are. Just pick them out randomly. Cause even if you've seen it already, it's still going to be

169
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:29,880
good. That's the strategy for every airplane from any season. Doesn't matter what it is.

170
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,079
That's a boomer show. I want that person actually timed up that, that, that was what you just said

171
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:52,730
was offensive to me. Time them up for two minutes, at least a minute. I'm going to pick up range Andy

172
00:26:52,730 --> 00:27:08,650
right now while I'm still doing pretty good damage. They got timed out. I'm saying Andy,

173
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:17,000
we don't even say it here. I do. What do you mean? I, I'm saying it right now. I say it all. What

174
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,559
do you mean we don't say it here? I say it every stream, like a hundred times the stream.

175
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:37,799
Maybe you don't, but I do. Did you, I've read that wrong. Oh, did I read that wrong?

176
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:49,299
What'd you say? You're overusing, you're overusing it. We love Andy here. We love saying Andy.

177
00:27:49,940 --> 00:28:02,119
It's just such a quick way to get a point across about anything. It just really is. Like I told

178
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,400
you, zoomer. Well, that's, I don't think Andy is zoomer. That's more millennial, but like millennial

179
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,660
versus boomer, like me sitting here and explaining this, what you're seeing on the screen, this

180
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:23,349
character. Well, this character, I'll tell you at some point throughout the last hundred years or so,

181
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:31,109
fire became a device that was able to be used coming out of a propulsion machine that has oil

182
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:37,589
and a propulsion mechanism with an emulsifier in it. And what that does is that allows the fire to

183
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:43,029
go forward and be able to do what you're doing, wiping out all those monsters that I see. And it's

184
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:52,279
pretty wonderful invention versus flamethrower Andy. I can get my point across very quickly.

185
00:28:52,279 --> 00:29:15,059
Oh, yes. You just lost a hundred viewers. It's all right there. They're going to be back or they're

186
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,970
not. Don't worry. Don't worry about how many people are here or not. They're going to come back or

187
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:42,779
they're not. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm at work. Say hi. Am I on a work TV?

188
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:04,539
Yes, man. I'll tell you that the finance department is doing such an unbelievable job.

189
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:12,809
If you can hear this right now, a lot of the departments that are working for this company

190
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:17,539
are doing fantastic. So a great experience I've had working with them. I've never worked with them,

191
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:20,579
by the way, just for complete transparency sake. I've never worked with anybody here. I don't know

192
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:25,380
what this job is and I don't condone or support anything that anybody's doing in this. It's proven

193
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,579
to what that could be otherwise. So that was a joke and I have no idea what you do and I have no

194
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:59,059
idea what's going on in this business. It's too late. Centrist Andy. I don't know what the fuck

195
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:09,319
I'm talking about. That person could have just made that up just like I did. Verify your information

196
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:24,920
everybody before you make any, make sure you verify info. I love how that turned. I love

197
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:52,470
how that dumb joke just turned into verify info. Okay, you turned it into a PSA. Yeah, I did. Can

198
00:31:52,470 --> 00:32:06,950
you please do your Adam Sandler bee sting on tongue impression? Is that close? I think that's

199
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:22,730
what you meant. Is that what you meant? I feel like that's what you meant. What happened to night time

200
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:30,630
streams? Well, the reason why I'm streams are early is because stir is coming into Vegas.

201
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:44,650
So I want to get prepared for stir. I'll be hanging out with stir. You're going to do an

202
00:32:44,650 --> 00:33:06,779
IRL stream. No, something new. Oh shit. One of these is good. What do you mean prepare? I don't know.

203
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:15,099
When you have a friend coming into town, you want to make sure that like things look a little cleaner.

204
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:20,500
Things look better. It's not like a, I don't know. I want to make sure I got like an itinerary to

205
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:28,019
fun stuff to do. What are you talking about? You don't prepare for an arrival for someone

206
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:42,809
if they're coming in that week. What are you talking about? I think it's these. Are you guys

207
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:55,720
going to watch Barbie? I don't think so. What are the specs of your PC? I don't even know.

208
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,980
It's been a long time. I think I have a command. Isn't there a command to tell you guys what's in

209
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:16,630
my computer that I used to have one of those? Oh, there it is. Okay. Let me tell you. I have

210
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:28,489
eight 64 P. That's not right. Did it pop up? I'm so I'm still pissed off that you called me ball

211
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:33,769
fondler instead of bomb fondler during the day of the diver. Oh, that's your okay. Well, but you're

212
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:37,849
still in the ball fondler category though, because there's three X's before your name and you have

213
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,929
ball after the three X's. Come on. You got to give me a little bit of credit. The chat goes by fast

214
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:52,900
a lot sometimes. Yeah, I've got a 3090 and a I don't even know. Is it AMD or Intel in here?

215
00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:05,349
AMD 5600 X. I got 64 gigabytes of RAM. I know that these ones are probably better, but I'm going to

216
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,099
take these and I'm going to deposit this because I think it's fun. And that's what I'm playing this

217
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:23,369
game for. Now I'm going to deposit that when I come back up, try wear it 10 crit or I don't

218
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:28,059
think you can compete with 10% base crit, but it's crit damage better than having skeletons

219
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:56,329
run around. Probably not. Are you going to shave before stirr is here? Stirr prefer bowing or air

220
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:24,699
bus. I don't know. Please choose range for the love of God. This is just a warm up round. And

221
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:31,239
plus we're just talking. I'm just hanging out. I'm not trying to optimally play the video game. I'm

222
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:44,599
trying to survive long enough to talk over it. That's kind of funny, but look, look at how much

223
00:36:44,599 --> 00:37:01,670
better this is than range. I'm getting a lot of items. Okay. I feel like phantom needles is good

224
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:18,760
here. This is just now. Transfection is amazing. Just does so much damage. What is stirr's

225
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:47,289
astrological sign? Um, I don't know. He's a night elf. I don't know. Hmm. Range. Take the range.

226
00:37:47,289 --> 00:38:06,300
All right. Now I gotta go up here. I gotta start doing some survivability here. I'm going to

227
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:18,630
deposit the skeleton ring. That's a good idea. This 10% fragile chance. What is fragile? Let's

228
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:29,619
see. Breach stack. Affliction increases the damage taken from damage over time. Well,

229
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,789
that's amazing. Modifies the chance to apply effects on enemies for every a hundred percent

230
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:54,650
chance. One stack is guaranteed. Hey, Jerma, let's go. What are we, where, what are we going?

231
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:12,219
What are we going? I want to be, I might, there's an opportunity to beat the actual boss here.

232
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:54,949
All right. I got to stop going down. I gotta go up. Great chance. All the blood stains, bro. Am I

233
00:39:54,949 --> 00:40:00,900
ready for the blood stain yet? Should I get a little bit stronger? Am I ready to do it? Because

234
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,780
I'm imagining that's going to summon like a hard boss or something. I don't think I'm ready for it.

235
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:19,429
Watching you play this makes me want to eat my own hands. Uh, I could probably think of a few other

236
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:43,929
things you could be doing if you really wanted to not do that. This one. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not very

237
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:49,289
locked in right now. I'm, I'm looking over at the chat reading. This is, this is more like a podcast

238
00:40:49,289 --> 00:41:17,989
stream. Ooh, it's a lot of area. Okay. I, what am I getting hit by? Lightning. Let me at least

239
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:37,050
deposit this. I mean, there's just, I can't take anything else. All right. Last pass. I'll get the

240
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:52,789
last pass here. All right. Now I'm going up. I'm going to go get the magnet too. We have a return

241
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:58,519
to the Sims. Yeah, definitely. Sims is a great game just to open up and just play it whenever,

242
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:08,309
even if there's no mods on it, it's just fun to start a new person. So yeah, it's kind of a staple,

243
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:22,739
isn't it? The Sims is always fun no matter what, but I never want to overdo it though.

244
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,929
I feel like the Sims is one of those things where it's really fun for like a week and then you kind

245
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:33,670
of let it go for six months, come back and it's a whole new, fresh, fun experience again. You can

246
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:47,219
kind of do that over and over again. You'd like Project Zomboid. I thought about playing Project

247
00:42:47,219 --> 00:43:08,099
Zomboid. I want to, there's a lot of games to play and there's, I have lots of, I have lots of

248
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:15,610
potential streaming stuff to do. And it works out a lot, especially for somebody, I mean as a, you

249
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:21,130
know, the stream reduction that a lot of you guys have been used to this. Well, not even reduction,

250
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:41,000
but hold on, I don't want to die. You can play Borderlands 2? Probably not. Zomboid is boring

251
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,429
and overrated. I think I just never played it because it reminded me almost of looking at Path

252
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:56,170
of Exile the first time. Where it's just like, this is, look, this seems very, this seems like

253
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:01,099
a lot going on here that I don't know if I want to give the time to learn about it. Is that correct?

254
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:20,599
Kind of? No, actually, yeah. All right. That, that one guy saying pick range, I hope they're happy

255
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:47,820
because I've picked it like eight times in a row. Definitely this. Let's deposit this so I can do

256
00:44:47,820 --> 00:45:00,599
Skeleton Friends eventually. It's a hard learning curve, but it's really fun. It does look very fun,

257
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:11,219
I will say. Max out Dragon Breath as fast as possible because it's the best ability in the

258
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:43,429
game from what I've seen. Ouch. Jeez. What is hitting me? Hurry up. Die. Okay. Firewalker boots

259
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:51,460
or I can't really take these anyways. Do I, am I missing anything? No. This is cool for this

260
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:03,900
character, but these really don't seem like they're that good. I mean, I'm the fire character, but

261
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:12,489
the fire doesn't seem that great. 15% movement speed seems just good no matter what. The boots

262
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:24,570
are amazing for bosses though. You use them, they suck. I use them with the not fire character and

263
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:32,760
I feel like I have a lot of burn and a lot of bonuses to fire right now. You should try Baldur's Gate.

264
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,670
I've heard a lot about Baldur's Gate and I'm kind of afraid to put any time into it because I feel

265
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,710
like it's one of those games where you need to know an entire encyclopedia before you start

266
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:58,150
playing it. Is that true? Not true. I think any, because Baldur's Gate is a D&D kind of, based on

267
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:04,860
D&D, right? All I remember was hearing about, oh this game is like kind of built on top of D&D,

268
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:10,940
it's like a D&D game. Oh cool, it was Neverwinter. And I remember being like, whoa, I mean I can like

269
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:19,739
play this as a ton of like characters and classes. And I remember playing this character just, I was

270
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:25,159
so disappointed in the game because I was playing it wrong. And I remember just like playing it and

271
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:30,820
the character I made, the only move that the character had was they went like, they did like

272
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,380
a whistle or like a sing and that was it. That's the only move I did. And I was like, this is,

273
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:44,920
I don't, I'm not having any fun. I like one move. I was like, why do I, I don't, I don't, I'm playing

274
00:47:44,920 --> 00:48:02,869
this so wrong, aren't I? I think I was playing like a musical character, like a bard or something.

275
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:11,460
That was a pepino? God damn it, it was. I'll take them.

276
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:25,769
Is it weird that sometimes I just go to YouTube and type in a pepino scream and just listen to it

277
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:38,010
like 10 times in a row and then go on with my day? Is that weird? I do this not that often,

278
00:48:39,289 --> 00:49:05,260
maybe once every couple months. What about Mortal Kombat 1? Yeah, I'll play it. I'll play

279
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:12,869
Mortal Kombat 1. You guys can all queue up and just absolutely shit on me. We'll make a fun

280
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:33,579
night out of it. More area, yes. I gotta start looking for health because I'm almost at the

281
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:45,690
30 minutes. I beat the boss last time, right? Yeah, I did. I got to the end with the other

282
00:49:45,690 --> 00:50:00,739
character. Do the blood trail? No, I'm afraid. I'm scared of it. Why did that person just write

283
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:21,420
stimulus? Why did you do that? WM1, Andy? Yeah. You know what else is really funny too about

284
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:27,800
getting a little older? Kind of starting to feel myself grow up a lot. Back when I first played

285
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:34,090
Team Fortress 2, I remember. I remember being like, oh, WM1, come on. You could do better than that.

286
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:44,630
You suck at this game. What's with this? You're on pyro, of course. This pyro sucks. Now I'm just

287
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,829
like, oh man, I like this class a lot. This vlog class, I just can walk forward for a second.

288
00:50:50,550 --> 00:51:05,219
It's funny. Everybody talks shit about pyro until they play pyro and then they're quiet,

289
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:11,530
right? You even notice that? Sit there, you get killed by a pyro and it's like,

290
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,730
you fucking idiot. What do you fucking even know about this game? What do you even know about

291
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:22,500
aiming? And then you pick pyro and you just kind of silently play it and you're like, wow,

292
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:28,730
this is a lot of fun. I'm quiet. I know I'm not having any fun. No, don't say that. I'm

293
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:45,690
not having fun. I've definitely come to appreciate pyro a lot more in like the,

294
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:58,489
in the second kind of half of my kind of online life. It's like, wow, pyro is good. I always like

295
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:13,940
pyro though. All right. I got to pay attention. I actually, I'm going to be quiet for real.

296
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:26,730
It's funny. I'll say that about spy too, right? You get, you get absolutely dominated by spy.

297
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,889
That's just kicking everybody's ass in the server. And you're like, oh, what the fuck? Like, fuck you.

298
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:38,010
Fuck you. And then you play spy and like bump into three walls and don't hit anybody. You face stab

299
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:44,659
a person and die instantly. And you do, you're zero for your team. And it's just like, oh,

300
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:50,739
right. This is like kind of like, it takes like a lot of skill to really kind of do this reliably.

301
00:52:53,530 --> 00:53:11,269
Forgot. Yes. All right. Three minutes. And then I'm going to pay attention.

302
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:21,610
I'm actually kind of excited about opening those boxes. It's been a long time since I've done

303
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:42,519
something like that. Really. It's time for some loot get. That's right. Where's that magnet?

304
00:53:43,079 --> 00:54:01,500
There it is. This is the second one too. Oh, burn chance or yeah. No, I think I'm taking crit

305
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,659
because the boss is about to run in. I'd rather be able to do damage quickly.

306
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:23,880
Yeah. Holy shit. That's so much. It's hard to even see because it's coming in so much.

307
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:52,150
What is going on? Okay. More crit. Level 60. More crit. All right. I'm ready for the boss.

308
00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:02,519
I'm only going to take health regen now if I see it. Health and health regen is the only

309
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:32,619
thing I'm going to pick up. I got to turn on auto attack. There it is. Because I want to

310
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:39,300
auto attack the boss and just focus on moving around. Nice. It's got a health push, I think.

311
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:56,019
What about viewfinder? That's what we will open with next week. That's the

312
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,940
because I do really want to play that game. It looked really just like a nice experience.

313
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:38,019
All right. 40 seconds or so. I'm getting kind of collapsed on here. Good. Oh, I think taking the

314
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:42,440
50 health is better because in the amount of time it would take me to get 50 health from this,

315
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:56,519
it would be too late. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. I want to beat it with a second character.

316
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:57,019
Come on. All right. Here we go. Fucking that pole just screwed everything up.

317
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:02,920
I'm good. Get away from these poles. They're ruining everything.

318
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:33,050
Actually just ruin the whole run. Oh, shit. I didn't have enough movement speed and those

319
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:45,190
poles ruined everything. When he does the three in a row, they're like, if you don't have enough

320
00:58:45,190 --> 00:59:03,349
movement speed, you're going to get hit no matter what. All right. Oh, let's do it again. What did

321
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:18,019
I? Well, shit. I didn't look at the unlocks. Where is it? Milestone story swift is an arrow.

322
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:40,300
There it is. All right. I got 750 gold for this one. I already got that money stream of fire

323
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:52,710
traits. What did I unlock? Are you going to abandon sorcery? No, we'll at the very least,

324
00:59:52,710 --> 01:00:06,329
we will conclude. We will conclude sorcery. I'm telling you. Didn't I deposit the oh shit.

325
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:24,019
I have to buy it. That's right. I want that. You have 4% additional damage for each burning enemy

326
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:53,719
up to 60%. I like the fire character. It's very good. I think I'm good with this attack.

327
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:15,559
Maybe just more damage. Just straight up damage. This is becoming a problem. So more health and

328
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:23,380
regen in the beginning. It's a new game you're looking forward to the most. The Elden Ring DLC.

329
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:38,650
I don't think anything even compares. All right. I'm going again. That hasn't been announced.

330
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:46,940
That was a great spawn. Radiant aura. Cast light that distributes its damage equally among all

331
01:01:46,940 --> 01:02:03,530
foes in its range. Automatically cast in intervals. Let's try it. Ah, I like this a lot. They announced

332
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:06,329
the Elden Ring DLC. They didn't announce when it was coming out. They announced it was being

333
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:18,230
worked on. I actually just shit my pants. I feel bad for you because it sucks when that happens.

334
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:29,429
Genuinely, it's really not fun. Yeah. Sorry about that. You know what's funny about what

335
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:33,590
you just said though? Imagine shitting your pants and sitting there after shitting your pants. You

336
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:42,260
just did it. And typing into a chat, hey, I just shit my pants for real. Why are you just sitting

337
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:49,800
there? Like, okay. You should probably go take care of it first, then talk about it. I think

338
01:02:49,800 --> 01:03:00,179
that that's probably a good order of operations there. Now, it would have been even funnier if

339
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:07,260
you wrote, oh my God, I just shit my pants comma space. What do I do? That would have added a little

340
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:12,780
bit for me because that means you're just still sitting there and you're just like, I don't know

341
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:30,090
what to do about this. Please stop. I'm eating. Sometimes I forget that because I'm this way too.

342
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:38,460
Anytime the TV is on or anytime I'm watching any media, food is part of the picture at least 70 to

343
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:47,210
80 percent of the time. That is a food activity, sitting and watching something for me. So I forget

344
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:57,289
that sometimes that if I was just sitting there, oh my God, I got my delicious spread. I've got my

345
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:04,900
lunch and my dinner. It's right here. And the person I was watching was just like talking about,

346
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:11,670
yeah, I get it. But then again, I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about.

347
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:20,539
And that's it. That's all I'm going to say. I'm not going to change it.

348
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:27,670
I'm stacking health regen first. Open crates. I probably shouldn't have told you guys I was

349
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:34,889
going to do that. We're getting all caps open crates now. I probably shouldn't have even said

350
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:58,980
I was doing that. Open those crates. Hurry. I will. I will just chill crates now. Stop playing this

351
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:10,360
game and gamble already. Hey, by the way, when each crate opens, we all have to like rub our

352
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:27,719
hands together like this. Hey, buddy, the. Hold on. Hey, buddy, the blood trail alters give you

353
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:35,530
buffs. I thought it was OK. Well, thank I appreciate the spoiler. I actually kind of do.

354
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:40,570
I mean, I like to kind of figure these games out sometimes, but sometimes you really just this is

355
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,409
no way to know what the hell is even going on in these games. I thought when I picked up both of

356
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:48,889
those pieces and went to the altar or whatever, that it was going to spawn a hard boss, but it's

357
01:05:48,889 --> 01:06:14,579
going to give me an item to help with the boss. So I guess I'll do it. One of these two. Can you

358
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:22,789
please put family guy clips in the corner? No. Blue ones are special. Wait, which ones?

359
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:37,239
Needles is probably better for this exact build right now. What? I'm playing the new version of

360
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:42,199
the game. I forgot the beta is out, right? So there is new stuff here. Oh, cool. All right.

361
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:49,460
Yeah, this is the beta is out. It's in beta. There's a bunch of new stuff. I can be so mean

362
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:59,659
to us. I'm not. You're interpreting me. My. Sorry, I lost something. I want to. There we go.

363
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:09,659
Is this the beta version? I imagine so, because I didn't have this light radius thing before.

364
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:21,239
You have to subscribe to the beta to access it. Oh, well, shit. You have to put the game.

365
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:26,570
You have to go into the beta change on Steam. I'll be playing this again. So it doesn't matter.

366
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:30,570
This is a fun game just to kind of play for like a few hours. It got caught lying.

367
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:40,199
I didn't get caught lying. I didn't have correct info. I thought that there was a patch to the

368
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:43,719
game that was because it was like, hey, the game's going into beta. So I'm like, oh, maybe it's I

369
01:07:43,719 --> 01:08:05,849
guess it's in beta. Steam auto updates everything. Steam is auto updating, right? That's not how

370
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:12,199
betas work. All right. The game is an early access game. I thought it was just going to

371
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,600
be. Hey, we're in like we're considered to be in beta now. We didn't update.

372
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:27,420
It takes like five seconds to do it. Is it going to mess with my save file? Does it make a different

373
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:53,079
save file or can I just do it after this run? You'll be fine. Yeah, I'll turn it on. What pizza

374
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:58,180
topping should you get? Pepperoni is easy. Doesn't weigh it down. I don't like when pizza gets weighed

375
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:03,960
down. You pick the thing up and the thing flops over like a fucking like it's a t-shirt. Like

376
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:15,479
coming out of the fucking dryer. Like, no, no, thanks. To me, toppings on a pizza should always

377
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:27,000
be always small enough to be able to not cause a flop problem. For instance, meat lovers pizza,

378
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,939
I find to be just I don't find I don't want to order it because it's not a it's a lasagna

379
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:37,340
because you're going to get it out of the bar. You're going to take the piece out. You're going

380
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,699
to put it on a plate and it's going to just be falling apart like a fucking lasagna. It's a

381
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:51,779
lasagna. Just eat it. Just eat a lasagna. He's a meat hater. No, it's just it's about weight.

382
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:57,619
I love sausage on pizza. I love, you know, like hamburger on pizza. I like pepperoni on pizza. I

383
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:04,520
like bacon on pizza. I just don't want all of them on piled on at the same time. It's all about

384
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:13,689
just, you know, the distribution. Meat haters pizza. There's just a bunch of lettuce on it.

385
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:32,359
This build sucks. It's been five minutes. I think I'm doing okay. Veggie pizza does go hard.

386
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:41,380
I like vegetables on pizza, but again, the same rule applies. Peppers and onions. Okay, nice.

387
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:53,829
Peppers and onions. Peppers and onions and olives though. No, that's one too many. No,

388
01:10:53,829 --> 01:11:09,880
peppers and onions. Please don't say go hard. Just trying to fit in. Does he know that this tomato

389
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:25,210
sauce on pizza? No, I had no idea. I thought it was um, that's a boomer Andy take. I don't think so.

390
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:48,699
I don't think that's a boomer take. I'm going for defense this time. What about flavored crust? I

391
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:54,060
think stuffed crust pizza is amazing. Something about the way that it bakes inside the dough. I

392
01:11:54,060 --> 01:12:00,090
don't know why, but it, it doesn't taste like any other cheese I've ever eaten and I can't,

393
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:07,109
you cannot, it's impossible to replicate. It's impossible. However, stuffed crust pizza gets made.

394
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:17,739
I don't know how, but it just tastes so much better than if I don't know. It's a completely,

395
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:31,640
it's like a weird unique flavor. It's really good. What's the worst pizza topping? Um, probably ham.

396
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:46,149
I don't get, I just, ham to me is just, what do you mean? What, what, what wrong, wrong? I know,

397
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:54,439
but it's just not, a lot of times you get ham on pizza. It's like that cubed ham, the cubes.

398
01:12:54,439 --> 01:13:07,420
I don't really want cubed ham on pizza. He does actually hate meat. I don't know if you were here

399
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:13,399
three days ago, but I talked about eating corned beef hash out of the can. Not in the way that you

400
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:25,350
think. I don't, that's not accurate. What should I take? I'm going to take these and deposit them

401
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:38,500
because this is like a tank. So maybe eventually I can make like a tank run. They sell corned beef

402
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:49,659
hash in a can. I, yeah, that's like how you, that's how you get it. Unless you go to a breakfast

403
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:57,210
place and they make it kind of fresh to order. The egg hash corned beef hot sauce concoction sounds

404
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:04,010
fucking awesome. It's, it is, it's wonderful. For those of you that weren't here, I'm going to,

405
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:11,779
I'll tell you again. Serving of the corned beef hash out of the can, put it in, you heat it up

406
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:19,659
on the stove. Get it nice to exactly where you want it. Do one, one like over medium egg or over

407
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:25,979
easy, over hard, however you like it. That goes on top. You're going to doop, doop, doop, doop with

408
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:32,659
Tabasco right on top of the egg. You're going to have one slice of toast and you're going to have

409
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:38,739
three heirloom tomatoes that have been cooked potentially in the oven. You're going to make

410
01:14:38,739 --> 01:14:45,989
more than three probably because you know, you're making this just nice and slow, low.

411
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:50,170
Those tomatoes, you know, you're not trying to cook them. You're just trying to kind of heat

412
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:56,229
them up a little. That's stoner food. No, it is not. That is, that is a great breakfast. If you

413
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:59,989
go to a breakfast place, they definitely have a corned beef hash meal and it is what I just

414
01:14:59,989 --> 01:15:20,090
described to you. It is the exact thing I just told you. Make it for me then. Some of you are

415
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:24,970
going to do it. Even if you don't do the tomato part, I would say you should probably put something

416
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:33,960
on there. That's not just eggs and meat. You know, something to give you a little bit of your

417
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:52,520
vegetable count for the day. I'm going to go down. You'd add rice to that. However you want to

418
01:15:53,159 --> 01:16:12,630
make it yours, right? Go for it. That's just how I do it. Bigfoot or Sasquatch? Do you confirm or

419
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:21,850
deny? What is it? Is it Bigfoot or Sasquatch or is it Bigfoot and Sasquatch? What's your question?

420
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:28,170
Are you asking if it's Bigfoot or Sasquatch or are you asking if I think they both exist?

421
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:47,189
I think it's two different people. Are there any cryptids that you believe in strongly?

422
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:57,720
Um, not necessarily. I mean, I do think there's probably stuff in the deep sea that we haven't

423
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,920
seen that could be to the level of what you're describing. Look at the weird animals that are

424
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:10,600
down there. There are animals that have lights on their heads. There are some really wacky deep sea

425
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:19,960
creatures. We have not really seen it all. So I'm one of those people where if it's kind of possible

426
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:28,310
then it's possible. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the Loch Ness Monster is,

427
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:35,340
you know, 10,000 feet deep in the ocean. I know it. I don't know. Maybe. Possible. I don't know.

428
01:17:35,979 --> 01:17:53,829
Do I think there's a big naked guy walking around in the woods behind your backyard?

429
01:17:53,909 --> 01:18:04,649
No, not necessarily. I don't, I don't know. Like do I think there's like a like a 15 foot

430
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:13,289
hairy naked guy that's walking around just kind of hanging out in the woods? I don't think so.

431
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:37,770
I could, I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. If you ever do see Bigfoot,

432
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:45,739
I feel like, I don't know, would Bigfoot just run? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Another person saw me.

433
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:51,430
Oh, I'm naked and I'm running around. Or would Bigfoot be like, listen, I know this is fucked up

434
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:56,090
looking and I know, you know, you found me. But let me tell you something. I've got a secret bank

435
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:03,449
account in that secret bank account. I've got fucking $6 million. Don't say shit. And I will,

436
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:09,380
I will fucking sell you the money. I'll sell you a fucking $10,000 a day. I don't know.

437
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:31,239
It's piercing work with the fire. He can speak. I don't know. Scammer Bigfoot.

438
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:39,979
You can just listen. Let me tell you something. I've got a bank account with $10 million in it.

439
01:19:39,979 --> 01:19:53,020
All you need to do is you need to send me 50 and then I'll send you 10,000 next week.

440
01:19:53,020 --> 01:20:08,359
Bigfoot's a scammer? That's not, that's not what I meant. But that's funny. You're my favorite

441
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:19,130
popsicle streamer. Can we, can we do the email that has not been put in the chat in like six

442
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:36,420
years? I think that's what they're referring to. Yep. Always take that every time. If you're the

443
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:58,489
fire character, it's a quick tip for you. The movement speed is what absolutely killed me last

444
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:02,439
time. So I got to focus on it for a little bit. I'm never going to play this game. Don't give me

445
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:08,279
any tips. So let me, I have to tell you, don't say that you're never going to do something.

446
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:14,979
Trust me. I have experience here saying you're never going to do something in the one small

447
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:21,350
off chance that you do, that you end up doing that. You're going to think back and go,

448
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:40,119
I should never have said I'm never ever doing this. I'm not though. But what if like in like

449
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:56,340
a year you come back and it's like your favorite game, dude? You never know. I want that archman.

450
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:09,479
I will never trust Bigfoot. You're calling me Bigfoot. Like, oh, Jerma is Bigfoot. He's

451
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,960
Jerma is a cryptid. He's Bigfoot. Don't you guys make fun of how small I am all the time?

452
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,970
What's going on there? Yeah, there's, there's a lack of consistency.

453
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:41,750
Like a consistency, small foot. That's not even, that's not even funny. That's not, that is so

454
01:22:41,750 --> 01:23:10,170
easy. Come on. You're not Bigfoot. You're small foot. That's easy. That's way too easy. So boss,

455
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:28,199
that thing is doing a lot of work. I'll take this again. The boss. All right, back up. Did I pick

456
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:45,819
anything? Yeah, I did. I'm going to deposit the boots. There's no way you can be Bigfoot. You

457
01:23:45,819 --> 01:23:56,649
smell like ranch and there's no ranch in the woods. Why can't I just take a bottle of ranch

458
01:23:56,649 --> 01:24:00,810
into the woods and drink it in the woods? Well, I don't understand the logic behind that. There's

459
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:22,149
no ranch in the woods. Why can't I just have it in my backpack while I'm walking around? I kind

460
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:42,380
of shredded that guy. Um, I'm not going to use this, but I'd rather deposit these because I want

461
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:48,710
to be able to make a tanky character. Why are you not denying that you smell like ranch? I don't

462
01:24:48,710 --> 01:25:05,210
smell like ranch dressing. I don't even like ranch dressing, ranch dressing to me. And you're

463
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:14,359
going to think I'm gross. This is the take that a lot of people determine if they like you as a

464
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:26,039
person or not, which is like relax. I think that ranch is just a, it's just to me, I like blue cheese

465
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:38,380
better anywhere I would be putting ranch blue cheese is used in that scenario. What should I

466
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:48,600
take here? Ranch to me is just not quite there. And I would prefer blue cheese to be the thing

467
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:57,239
instead of ranch. I get that opinion because I'm a huge Buffalo chicken fan. Buffalo chicken is

468
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:03,640
probably my favorite food. One of the top three favorite foods ever. And that combination has

469
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:20,180
just been burned in my brain forever. This dude eats crayons. He's lying. If they're dipped in

470
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:26,550
blue cheese. Um, no, I don't, don't give them any more. Don't give them anything else. Don't

471
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,789
give them anything else. That'll be, that'll be, that'll be, that'll be on like Twitter.

472
01:26:30,789 --> 01:26:36,420
Everybody eats crayons. Everybody eats, everybody eats crayons. Everybody eats crayons. Hey, did you

473
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:41,819
hear? Everybody eats fucking crayons today. No, don't give them anything else. Don't give them

474
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:57,380
anything more. It's X now idiot. Oh, oh, that's right. It is. I, okay. All right. What are you

475
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:04,760
talking? Okay. Well, whatever. I'll see you on, I'll see you on X. Is that what it is? That it is

476
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:19,750
what it is. Yeah. No one said that. Don't call it that. I, I don't pay very much attention to

477
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:26,149
Twitter. I don't even use social media. I don't know what the fuck is going on. Guys. I use

478
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:41,340
Twitter to like DM people and tell you when the stream is taking this DMing, like other content

479
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:46,539
creators and streamers for, Oh, Hey, you want to, I'm doing this like house flipper thing.

480
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:55,720
Like that's what I use Twitter for is, is for like talk, talking to colleagues.

481
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:14,439
How come you didn't DM me because I'm not going to bro. I actually think I had a pretty good one.

482
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:29,140
Let me see. Let me see. Let me look at my notes. Let's see. Did I have a good one? I feel like I'd

483
01:28:29,140 --> 01:29:00,520
had one recently. Maybe not. Really? I thought I did. Damn. I still have the whole, um,

484
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:14,819
Adam Sandler movie notes. No shit. I fell off big time. Yeah. I fell off. Absolutely. I completely

485
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:23,750
fell off. I thought I had a couple of like draft reads for you guys. Yeah. I fell off. That's all

486
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:44,649
right. He's well, he's washed up now. He's all washed up. Hey, I'd rather be all washed up than

487
01:29:44,649 --> 01:30:26,939
dirty. Hmm. Okay. Dad. Minus two, minus two. No, no, no. Stop that. Minus two dad. That's something

488
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:54,119
that I would be. Cry me a river, small foot. Ban that person for life. Do it actually. Execute order

489
01:30:54,119 --> 01:31:32,039
number 666. Too many, too many Dantas. Too many Dantas. Too many. Somebody's on stage doing that.

490
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:37,960
And like the whole crowd's like, too many. These are too many of these. Stop it. Boo. Stop. Too many.

491
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,949
Too many. This dude's just got the microphone going.

492
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:55,140
He will get up and leave. All right. No, he really, he really just fucking washed up now.

493
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:01,300
Yeah. Like that was, that was awful. You hear how many times you do the Star Wars, like interlude

494
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:23,619
thing. Like he fucking fell off. All right. I'm going to the well. I can take a lot more hits.

495
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:38,649
This is great. I'm actually happy about this. All right. Well then magnet. I went to hash house

496
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:56,149
at Gogo recently. It was pretty nice. This is great at the link. All right. I'm depositing the

497
01:32:56,149 --> 01:33:09,260
tank boots. It feels going to be better. All right. And then I'm going to do well. Then let's do blood

498
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:19,319
stain first. Blood stain first because I want to see what that does. I need movement speed

499
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:32,869
and damage going forward. Really, really, really important because I'm way too slow right now.

500
01:33:33,430 --> 01:34:03,859
Whoa. Really? Double flamethrower. Is it a double flamethrower? Oh, that's actually kind of insane.

501
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:18,020
All right. Attack speed or let's just max this out. It's so much worse now. It's a,

502
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,800
that's going to be a boss killer though. I think it should be really good against boss.

503
01:34:28,220 --> 01:35:00,949
All right. Let's get the first one and nine, eight, okay. Burn chance. All right. Now we go

504
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:06,970
to the other side or should I get the, I'm going to go, while there's still 10 minutes,

505
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:09,529
I'm going to get this first and then we're going to go to the well and then get the second piece.

506
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:35,430
All right. So when I have the full pieces, where do I take it back to that? They alter. You don't.

507
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:41,500
You just hold it. Oh, what does it do? All right. I need movement speed now.

508
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:46,779
Stop. I got to stop picking stuff. That's not moving speed. This is becoming a problem.

509
01:35:47,579 --> 01:36:12,739
You married into it. Oh, why would you come back then? We'd be closed.

510
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:29,029
Movement speed. Take it. Yes. Just do it. I know the other one's good, but I'm going to get a bunch

511
01:36:29,029 --> 01:37:04,250
of levels right now. Again, do it again. Back speed again, moving speed, more health, more piercing.

512
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:16,470
All right. I don't even think I don't have to get the magnet anymore because I just got two of them.

513
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:20,550
Putting it up your whole life. You just don't know. You need to call it.

514
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:31,510
I need to know what I stand to win. Stand to win everything. Call it. Well done. That is my favorite

515
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:50,920
scene of any movie ever. I think it is. Look at that melting. This is, and this is an act boss,

516
01:37:52,170 --> 01:38:09,020
right? This is like act two. Gone. Dead. You think Bigfoot would enjoy your screams?

517
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:12,140
No, Bigfoot's probably one of the people in here just like talking shit every day.

518
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:30,329
I wouldn't be surprised. I imagine like, you know, like a lot of like the boxing is like really kind

519
01:38:30,329 --> 01:38:34,569
of coming back. Like a lot of people getting involved in boxing. There's like chest boxing and

520
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:40,060
there's like, you know, creator clash and like there's a lot of like boxing events. What if

521
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:44,859
somebody boxed Bigfoot and Bigfoot just beat the ever living fucking shit out of this person?

522
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:56,060
It's like, oh, like German versus Bigfoot. And we find somebody that's like literally fucking

523
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:01,739
eight feet tall. That's like three or four hundred pounds jacked. Unbelievable in unbelievable

524
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:06,619
condition. And I think I can win. And I just get the absolute fucking shit beat out of me.

525
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:15,670
Like it's ridiculous. It is ridiculous. And it shows me before the fight signing a bunch of

526
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:30,329
documents saying, do not stop this fight. I will win. And he just like picks me up overhead and

527
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:43,380
like throws me into the fucking crowd after like six straight minutes of like, like to my face.

528
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:58,390
And then zoom in on some people in the front row that are holding stacks of money,

529
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:04,579
the cigars and the emails cheering because it's like, oh my God, this was free money.

530
01:40:04,579 --> 01:40:31,420
This was so much fucking. This was so free. Now, why would you lose? Because that's funny.

531
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:39,460
I don't even want to throw one punch. I want to taunt in the ring when the bell rings

532
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:42,739
and then it's just me being hit in the head over and over again.

533
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,869
I go out to the outside of the ring and I'm picking up like objects to hit him with.

534
01:40:54,869 --> 01:40:59,989
Like this is illegal. Like, like it's over. The fight's over. I've been disqualified.

535
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:03,270
I'm picking up like mic stands and trying to hit him in the fucking head with it and stuff.

536
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:26,819
Like I've already lied. I've been disqualified. It's personal at this point. This is a Yakuza

537
01:41:26,819 --> 01:41:45,220
sub story. No, I'll never truly step into the ring. I couldn't. All the medical problems I

538
01:41:45,220 --> 01:42:06,180
still have now. It's a fun little thing to think about, but no, I really want to just stand still

539
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:13,050
right here. Oh, I can't fuck shit. All right. All right. Don't I've got four minutes. Don't lose it

540
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:20,699
now. Where's my movement speed? Pause the tank boots and we got to go. Oh, wait, the other

541
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:40,180
blood stain. I'll do that right now. Am I going the right way? It's not here. There's so much

542
01:42:40,180 --> 01:43:05,539
shit here. I can't get it all. How do I feel? I still feel like I'm so slow. All right. Get in

543
01:43:05,539 --> 01:43:14,310
the ring with Bigfoot and it's like a big deal. We do weigh-ins. Yeah. Let's take, let's take a look.

544
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:20,630
Bigfoot has a about 40 inches of reach on a, on German 985, which is not surprising.

545
01:43:37,829 --> 01:43:47,220
Only 40. I don't know. I don't know much about how that works. All right. There's the other piece

546
01:43:47,779 --> 01:44:02,779
coming to my eye. Come on, get out of my eye. All right. I got the whole thing now.

547
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:08,100
So now what? What does this do for me now? Do I have to do anything special or just fight the boss

548
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:28,329
with it on? I'm looking for health and movement speed. Just fight the boss. Okay. You're never

549
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:32,949
going to open crates. Uh, we're going to do it after this. Whatever happens in this run.

550
01:44:41,460 --> 01:45:02,789
Face damage. Yeah. So short. There's money down here. Okay. I think, uh, like I said,

551
01:45:02,789 --> 01:45:08,939
in one of the tank boots, I think that's an interesting thing to build whole health.

552
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:12,779
Holy shit. All right. All right. All right. There's no excuse now. I see movement speed.

553
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:24,579
I have to get it. It doesn't matter what else is up there. I still feel like I'm a little

554
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:45,640
too slow, but I'll, I'll concentrate. I'll try these. This is the boss killer build right now.

555
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:55,399
It's not the clear waves build. Ooh, head this way quick. Oh, get it all. Attack speed damage.

556
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:25,880
Yes. Movement speed. Uh, crit chance or attack speed. All right. That's going to be it. I hope

557
01:46:25,880 --> 01:47:01,270
this is enough. No, it's hard to see the fire in front of me. Healing potion. Oh my God.

558
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:18,180
Movement speed or health. What the fuck? He's dead. I already, I don't, I see, I killed him.

559
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:57,539
He's already dead. What did so much damage? Something hurt a lot. Whoa. Trying to keep

560
01:47:57,539 --> 01:48:21,350
him close. Not that close though. Oh, the item. That's right. Ooh, you survived and I got the

561
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:29,350
item. It's the item. Holy shit. That thing is incredible. Thanks for telling me that.

562
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:51,960
Unlocks trait type, spin and puncture, money, and then the rat ring. Very nice. Is it available to

563
01:48:51,960 --> 01:49:03,000
buy? Or is it just now in the item pool? Cool. I think I'm getting ready to be able to do the

564
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:13,989
second level. What is this one? Level 100 kill 50,000 enemies with effects. All right. So this

565
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:18,489
character is all the upgrades are available. Everything is available. It's just money now.

566
01:49:22,699 --> 01:49:30,010
Cool. All right. Let's open some crates in TF2. Probably only going to be live for like another

567
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:36,229
30, 40 minutes. I know this is a short one, but yeah, I'm just streaming when I can. And when I

568
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:45,579
think I feel like it, when I think I'm having a good time. Here we are. It's time to gamble.

569
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:54,869
Gamble. Oh, I'm not going to buy these yet because I don't know which one I want. All right. I'm

570
01:49:54,869 --> 01:50:00,119
going to just take a quick pee break. When I come back, we'll open some crates. We can examine them,

571
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:05,560
see if they're any good. I've only got like 20 keys. I know that's, that's a lot, but I don't

572
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:11,189
want to like overdo it. I'm just trying to clear out some of the old cases that I have. We'll see.

573
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:12,949
I'll be right back.
