1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm gonna play actual spy and like try to be spy.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:19,780
Okay. And I'm gonna bake-stab this guy. What?

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,649
Oh, what was that? You wanna get bake-stabbed? Bake-stabbed?

4
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,359
You wanna get bake-stabbed? Is that what you want? What about you, Heavy? I don't want that.

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,000
You wanna get friggin' bake-stabbed? I don't. I don't.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,420
Got him. Got him. 80. 80, 80. Got him. Okay, jump.

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,100
80, 80, 80, 80. Bake-stabbed that guy. I'm a soldier on your team.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,939
Just come out. Yeah, heal me. Let's go. Vaccinate an uber charge, baby. Let's do it.

9
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,560
Oh, what a mistake.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,840
I got him both. What a blunder.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,039
I feel so bad. I hate when stuff like that happens to me.

12
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,909
You're in there. I'm helping the team. I picked medic. Yeah, you just feel like so awful.

13
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:14,890
Let's get on this cot, guys. Come on. Get on. Somebody get on this cot.

14
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,129
Anybody. Anybody come on the cot with me. I'm a soldier. They're not doing so

15
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:25,579
peachy keen. Oh, is it? Hey, you got out. Heavy got out.

16
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,079
I got out. Man, a sniper. Anybody else? Oh, the same medic.

17
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,519
Heal me, dude. Come on. Oh, dude, get the mini sentry. I need your love. Oh, Mike.

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,659
Oh. Oh, that was not fun. Oh, I don't have enough. Come on,

19
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,370
cloak. Hey. You're like, you're not a spy.

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,030
Guys are standing on the inside of their spawn, disguised as somebody on our team.

21
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,629
I am your friend. Yeah, for instance, this guy is a spy.

22
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,900
For instance, you want to get backstabbed? What do you want?

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,390
Oh, that guy didn't want to get backstabbed. Come on, get out of my way, soldier.

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:11,710
I don't want to let you to hear me. And no, no, no.

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,960
Don't kill me. I'm just like somebody on your team spy.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,759
What the hell was that? What was he doing?

27
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,900
I'll just stand really still. What the hell?

28
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,409
All right, well. Oh, God.

29
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,530
That was unfair. If I've ever seen a crit rocket, that was unfair.

30
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,710
That was up there. Come on, we got to, like, snipe them.

31
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm going to let them crouching. I'm sniping. I'll lure them out here.

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,539
I'll just, like, they'll come see me. And there's so many snipers in there.

33
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,830
Yeah, I'm one of them. I'm almost out of ammo.

34
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,789
Come on. Am I trying to? Yeah.

35
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,379
Don't kill me. Get up.

36
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:03,949
Well, that guy knew.

37
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:10,800
Um, now what? Sap Mini Sentry, please.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,919
What is this guy? What are these guys doing?

39
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,919
I don't know. What is going on right now?

40
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,479
What the hell is going on? Should we switch teams?

41
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,789
I don't think we can. Dude.

42
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,870
All right, let's just go. Can we go on the other team?

43
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,110
I wish. I would. I'm just going to stand out here as the spy.

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm not even going to disguise. Oh, turn around.

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,280
There's so many people out here now. Oh, OK.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
I think they got killed, though. Never mind. Never mind.

47
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,379
Is that a spy? No.

48
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:51,379
Oh, my goodness gracious. I spent way too long taunting that guy.

49
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,300
I should have just shot him. He had no help.

50
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Do you think this is a game? Oh, I'm joining blue.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,180
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Can we go?

52
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,939
One minute left. I want to join, too.

53
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,099
Got to turn the tide. You see me? Show me mercy.

54
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,090
Or don't. I want to join the other team. I want to get to the first point.

55
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,670
All right, get to the first point. I dare you.

56
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,350
What on earth? I want to extend this like horrible, horrible match.

57
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,500
Good one. I mean, if there wasn't three snipers in a line in our spawn,

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,730
I think we'd be in a pretty good spot. I want to switch.

59
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,290
I want to play, too. I want to go on the other team and try and win.

60
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,160
You can't. I know. I really can't.

61
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,449
Oh, my God. Where'd that heavy come from? He had to have been invisible.

62
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,569
Invisible. Hey, it's like half invisible and half invulnerable

63
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:02,019
and half free to be an American. Screw you.

64
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,379
I knew that was you. It was like, who else would do this?

65
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,420
Oh, I still can't switch. Oh, I can't do it.

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,180
There's just so many people walking at me and you hopping around on rooftops.

67
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,829
I was playing Fiddler on the roof. I don't know why I had to kill you,

68
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,790
but I had to kill you. I think we might get the point.

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,899
I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen. Here we go.

70
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,649
Not going to happen. No, no, you ruined.

71
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,370
You really did. You were the only person behind.

72
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,009
It's the only person I had to turn around for. It's like right there.

73
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,209
Oh, who's this living room sad asshole? Who the hell is that guy?

74
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,129
I was like, I was on blue. Suck. We lost.
