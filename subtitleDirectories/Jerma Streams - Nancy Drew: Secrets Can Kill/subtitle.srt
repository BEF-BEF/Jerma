1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,110
Here we go. If this doesn't work, then I am gonna quit streaming.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:16,629
So it has to work. You know what I'm saying?

3
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:24,370
Here we go. Please work, please work, please work, please work, please work, please work!

4
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:33,130
Capture the whole thing. Why is- oh my god, I'm gonna fucking pee my pants on camera, I swear to god.

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:49,359
Oh my fucking god, I hate computers. You gotta be shitting me.

6
00:00:49,359 --> 00:01:01,899
I can't play it in that fucking shitty little window, guys.

7
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:07,379
And I can't even fix it, because I have to-

8
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,650
Nice resolution. I'm just installing another one.

9
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,870
I can't believe that people are still here watching this mess.

10
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,840
Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Install it.

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:46,780
Hi. If this doesn't work, I'm just gonna go to DOS.

13
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,629
You look like a ghoul?

14
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:07,659
I was about to just do a fucking ghoul scream into the camera. Like, right into the camera.

15
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,659
Alright, Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill. Sure, yes. Just steam client, strap in, whatever it's called.

16
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:26,259
Alright, is this one gonna get captured?

17
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,659
It's- this is the same thing as the last one.

18
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:46,580
Why is Secrets of the Old Clock captureable now?

19
00:02:47,580 --> 00:03:02,620
The game fucking crashed.

20
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,469
Hi, I'm Nancy Drew. This is my center of operations, my desk.

21
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,469
Go ahead and poke around.

22
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,469
If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the-

23
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:31,250
What? It's there, it's there, it's there, it's there!

24
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
... how to be a detective.

25
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,270
It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery-solving-

26
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Shut up.

27
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,270
Excuse-

28
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,270
What?

29
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,270
Excuse me, giant hu-

30
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,270
Excuse-

31
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,509
Excuse me, giant human person, but you seem to-

32
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:47,509
... business.

33
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,509
And be sure to check out my scrapbook.

34
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,509
I put memorabilia from all my past cases in there.

35
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,509
Killing-

36
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,509
Killing the old clock?

37
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,509
And at times, really scary.

38
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,509
But don't say anything about that to my dad, okay?

39
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:00,509
Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill.

40
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,909
And whatever you do, read what's in the file called Case File.

41
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,909
That'll tell you all about the mystery I'm about to try to solve.

42
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,909
If you think you're ready to dive into that mystery,

43
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,909
just click on the plane ticket and you'll be on your way.

44
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,909
Alright, Case File, let's see.

45
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,910
Curse, I gotta change this to be what the actual thing's actually called.

46
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,910
Secrets Can Kill?

47
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,860
Alright, it's alright if I'm having you sit there for like 15 straight minutes

48
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,930
of like a black screen.

49
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:45,600
Let me just change the stream info to Secrets Can Kill.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
A student named Jake Rogers was killed at a high school last week.

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
What?

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
An undercover detective by the name of Beach asked Aunt Eloise-

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Eloise if I could go undercover to investigate the murder.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm posing as a new student to see what the other kids may know about Jake

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
and his untimely aunt.

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm posing as a new student?

57
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:14,379
Wait, how old am I?

58
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:27,240
Check out How to Be a Detective.

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:41,699
How do I close the book?

60
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,980
What the fuck, man?

61
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,149
Shut up!

62
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,970
Okay, give me the plane ticket.

63
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,970
Put down the book.

64
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,970
Put the book down.

65
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,970
Put the book down, Nancy.

66
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,970
Put the book down.

67
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,410
How do I put down the book?

68
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:15,509
Oh my god.

69
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,509
The police detective wants me to pose as a student

70
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,509
to search for any leads at the school.

71
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,509
So, it's undercover I go.

72
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,509
I'm calling this case, Secrets Can Kill.

73
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,509
Love, Nancy.

74
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:46,069
Alright.

75
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,069
Nancy, I had to close the school library early today

76
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,069
but if you need to do any research for your case

77
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,069
the key to the library is in the safe.

78
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,310
Remember not to enter in a wrong combination.

79
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,370
Why is that underlined?

80
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,370
Is it going to like explode?

81
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,370
Why would you write that?

82
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:13,420
Six zero KS.

83
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,819
Raseo del Mar universe in the...

84
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,819
Is this my diploma?

85
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,569
Why would I have my diploma folded up into a drawer?

86
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,569
Don't you put that shit on the back of your wall.

87
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:38,699
Oh, what was it?

88
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,699
Six O-K-S, right?

89
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:48,120
That's not correct?

90
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,980
Six O-K-S.

91
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:18,819
Ooh, a key.

92
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:36,490
I got it.

93
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,220
What is going on here?

94
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
That's incorrect.

95
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:56,659
It's got to be...

96
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,659
This has got to come down.

97
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:17,480
Is this all the way to the little...

98
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,779
This is the top right corner.

99
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:37,559
Alright, so this is...

100
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,559
I'm getting there.

101
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:53,370
This is her face, right?

102
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:04,679
Hold on. Is it going to come down?

103
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,779
Now, I hate these types of puzzles.

104
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,779
Yeah, they're...

105
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,779
I'm keeping it together.

106
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:39,590
Alright, alright.

107
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,620
Now, I've got to get this.

108
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm going to have an aneurysm by this.

109
00:10:46,700 --> 00:11:25,019
You're fine. That goes up here.

110
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,019
I'm so close, but so far away at the same time.

111
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:33,669
Where is... This goes to the left.

112
00:11:33,669 --> 00:12:02,980
Motherfucker, it's right there.

113
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:16,039
Alright.

114
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,039
Come on.

115
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,039
So close.

116
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:51,059
I can fix this shit later.

117
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,710
You have to be done.

118
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,710
Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

119
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,299
He's not a senior detective.

120
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,690
I'm fine. I have to get this shit over here.

121
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:48,789
What?

122
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:50,789
I'm almost there, guys.

123
00:13:50,789 --> 00:14:29,379
I have it. I'm almost done.

124
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,379
I...

125
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,379
One guy that said, I hate these things.

126
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,379
They are the worst.

127
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,200
They really are the fucking worst.

128
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:48,379
I hate them.

129
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,379
It's so close. It's almost here.

130
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,580
It's ready, but they need to be moved.

131
00:15:42,779 --> 00:16:18,490
I just had it, and I fucked it up.

132
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,899
I know it's easy, but

133
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,899
I'm fucking so done.

134
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,830
I'm trying

135
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:40,200
to solve it.

136
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm about to just hold the power button on my computer.

137
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm about to hold the power button on the computer.

138
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

139
00:16:46,200 --> 00:17:12,619
I'm about to hold the power button.

140
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:39,240
This needs to be up here.

141
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,740
I know.

142
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Look, it's like the streamer

143
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
curse, okay?

144
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
If I was lying in bed doing this, I could probably do this in

145
00:17:47,740 --> 00:18:32,789
five seconds.

146
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:40,019
I was seconds away from holding down

147
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:45,529
the power button, I promise.

148
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:47,529
Okay, login name. Alois Drew, password

149
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,529
Owise Elder, school computer.

150
00:18:49,529 --> 00:19:03,079
Okay, got it.

151
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,319
Pain in the ass that was.

152
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,099
Alright, let's go.

153
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:11,099
This is kind of freaking me out.

154
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
This is kind of freaking me out.

155
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
This is kind of freaking me out.

156
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
So I'm pretending to be

157
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
a high schooler

158
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
and this guy's pretending to be my uncle.

159
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,210
Students, too.

160
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,210
The high school.

161
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,210
Is he pretending to be a student, too?

162
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,210
We're all pretending to be students?

163
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,210
We're all just detectives?

164
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,210
Wait, what?

165
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,789
That's me, right?

166
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,789
And I'm pretending?

167
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,789
I can't. I don't know you have contacts.

168
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:18,819
That's something I didn't have.

169
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,819
That's not part of my job.

170
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,349
What?

171
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,509
I can't play Barnacle Blast? Are you serious?

172
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,509
That's a shame.

173
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:59,700
That makes a cool sound.

174
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Alright, let's find our uncle

175
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,529
who's hanging out somewhere in the diner.

176
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,529
Oh, hey Jimmy!

177
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,529
He's a pulling dynamite character.

178
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,529
Of course. I'm just a bit...

179
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,529
Well, my undercover assignments

180
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,529
are usually not so...

181
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,529
suburban.

182
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,529
I understand.

183
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,529
The victim was a senior named Jake Rogers.

184
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,529
As usual, none of the family, teachers or students

185
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:49,529
know about any enemies he may have had.

186
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,529
Nothing came up from searching

187
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,529
his home, computer, cell phone or locker.

188
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:55,529
His bank records tell a different story.

189
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,529
Bank records?

190
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,529
He had a fairly large savings account and a lot of cash deposits.

191
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,529
We suspect he was involved in

192
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,529
something shady.

193
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,529
Drugs, gambling or blackmail.

194
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,529
That's where you fit in.

195
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,529
Talk to the students and see what you can find out.

196
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,529
We think he might have kept information about

197
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,529
his activities in a notebook or journal.

198
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,529
So keep a lookout for anything like that.

199
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,529
Anything else?

200
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,529
Bye Uncle Steve.

201
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,700
Goodbye Nancy.

202
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Okay. Any food on the table?

203
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Anything I can grab? Any slide puzzles

204
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
for me to almost turn my computer off?

205
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I ripped the plug out of the wall.

206
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,259
I'm looking for another slide puzzle.

207
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,700
What about here?

208
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,019
This is my house.

209
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:53,049
Okay. Homecoming.

210
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,950
I thought this was a golf club.

211
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,950
Surf club is cool. That's cool.

212
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:07,960
Is this the locker?

213
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Alright. I don't know this information yet.

214
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,619
Alright. Is this the gym?

215
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,240
Homecoming.

216
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,940
A note.

217
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Message. KRL.

218
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Sneeze and vid.

219
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Unroy.

220
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,619
Alright. What is that for?

221
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:49,500
Okay. For a second I thought that their mascot

222
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
was a sock.

223
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,859
With boxing gloves.

224
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,859
What a dumb mascot.

225
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:06,869
Extra pop. Grape. Orange.

226
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:08,869
Soda. Cool.

227
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:12,390
Or spot cola.

228
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,390
I would love to have a sip of cool cola.

229
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,299
Soda pop?

230
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,299
This is probably a puzzle.

231
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,299
Spot cola. Cool soda.

232
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,299
Orange soda.

233
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,049
Grape soda.

234
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,049
Grape. Orange. Cool. Soda.

235
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,049
No.

236
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:33,049
I need money.

237
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,589
Out of order?

238
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:40,789
Why do you think it costs money?

239
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,789
Holy shit. You just kind of stand.

240
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:53,990
The Hulk?

241
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,990
And then the pros.

242
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,809
Showtime.

243
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,809
Who are the manatees?

244
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,809
Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee.

245
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,809
Don't tell me you're afraid of a little sea cow.

246
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,809
Of course not. I know what to do if I come across

247
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,809
a manatee. Why would you immediately

248
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,809
talk about how you would fight and punch one

249
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,690
and hurt one?

250
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,690
Of course not. I know what to do if I come across

251
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,690
a manatee.

252
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,690
Yeah. Just sneeze and it'll swim away.

253
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,690
Seriously. The manatees are a great team

254
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,690
at a great school.

255
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,690
This school is cool. Except for a few punks like

256
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,690
Jake Rogers.

257
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,690
Jake Rogers?

258
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,690
I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him.

259
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,690
Is it the guy that died?

260
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,690
Sorry. Can't talk now. I gotta go to practice.

261
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:53,529
Later.

262
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,529
You name dropped the only person

263
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,880
who died.

264
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Yeah. This school is pretty cool. Except Jake

265
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,119
Robert. Jake Robert sucks. I hate him.

266
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,119
Oh. Okay. You know, he's dead.

267
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,049
Oh. Yeah.

268
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,599
Welcome to the school.

269
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,599
How could I get into Jake's locker?

270
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,599
I could tear the door off with my teeth.

271
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,599
But it just might be easier to ask

272
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,599
Hal Tanaka. His locker was right next to

273
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,029
Jake's. Okay.

274
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,029
What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?

275
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,029
He seems like a cool guy.

276
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,029
His family used to sponsor the annual football

277
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,029
awards dinner until last year.

278
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,029
You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.

279
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,809
Wait. What?

280
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,809
Hold on. I'm so

281
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,140
lost right now.

282
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
He knows, he knows that he's

283
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
that this

284
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
this guy's dead.

285
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
He talked about how much he's like

286
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,500
he sucks. And now he's like, oh

287
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
yeah. That's where the body was.

288
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,460
I'll talk to you later.

289
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
That's a psycho. Financing. Yeah. This is a psychopath.

290
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,400
You like checked every

291
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
box of are you a psychopath

292
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,339
or not? Alright. We gotta find, where's this

293
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:16,809
in the trash?

294
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,690
Eye test. E-V-I'll do

295
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:27,819
it. I'll do the eye test. Let's see

296
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:44,710
how good I do. E-V-I

297
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,710
F-O-R

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,079

O-T-E-M

310
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:19,799
I don't know.

311
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,799
B-F-F-A

312
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,799

K-A-A

315
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:36,940
P-I

316
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,250
Go to the doctor. No, I

317
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,869
can't do this. You know, okay,

318
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:46,869
when you go, okay, Jeremy, please

319
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,869
cover one eye and do it. And you cover one eye and you do it

320
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,869
and then it's like, oh, do the other eye. And it's like

321
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,500
I can't. It's all blurry.

322
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,849
You can only do this once. You actually

323
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,849
can only do that test one time. You can't do the other eye.

324
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,849
Because my eye, the other eye is like all

325
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:05,619
fucked up and blurry and shit.

326
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,700
You got about half of that wrong.

327
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,029
Well, maybe down by the bottom. Don't

328
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:17,029
press it. No, it's the

329
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:19,029
it's the light coming back into your eye.

330
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,029
It's like all blurry and smushed.

331
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,029
Go to a doctor. What are you talking

332
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:30,140
about? Go to a doctor.

333
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

334
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,880
Alright. Please go to a doctor

335
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
that shouldn't happen. What are you, what?

336
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,210
When I cover one eye

337
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,210
and then I do, I cover one eye for long

338
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,210
enough and I take my hand off that eye and I cover

339
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,210
it. It's like this eye that was covered

340
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,900
is all fucked up.

341
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Bro, don't you have a hernia? Yeah.

342
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:02,900
It sucks. Okay, I found a coin.

343
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:12,059
Let's go get a drink. The drink is not

344
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,900
in the women's bathroom. How do I get

345
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
the hell out of here? Alright, drink.

346
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Uh, I want a

347
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
what should I get? Cool soda?

348
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,809
Or should I get extra pop? I think, yeah,

349
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,809
cool soda. Definitely.

350
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,470
That is wasted quarter.

351
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:45,019
Alright, we're gonna go talk to this

352
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,019
whoever was the locker?

353
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:53,349
Where would I find this person?

354
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:56,359
Learning is the only thing the mind never

355
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,359
exhausts, never fears, and never regrets.

356
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,359
Da Vinci.

357
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:13,539
Thank you, Da Vinci. Very nice.

358
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,539
Yes. Thank you, Da Vinci.

359
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,339
Danger. Admit to authorize

360
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,339
personnel only. What do you mean danger?

361
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:29,059
This is like a high voltage room back here?

362
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,059
Alright, hold on. This is a puzzle?

363
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, I don't know the code.

364
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,130
Alright, I remember that's here.

365
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,619
Okay. Hi, I'm Connie.

366
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:49,619
You're not from around here, are you?

367
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,619
Usually, Paseo Del Mar High is

368
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,619
really quiet and boring. Connie, where'd you get that?

369
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,619
Lately, it's been totally out of control.

370
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:58,309
I want one of those.

371
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,309
Where do I get this? They don't have that here.

372
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,309
They don't sell that here. You brought that in from home.

373
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,309
No outside food or drink

374
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,309
allowed. I'm reporting you to the hall monitor.

375
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,049
Out of control?

376
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:13,049
One of the students was

377
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:17,019
killed last week. Who

378
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,019
was killed? Oh, just this

379
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,019
wannabe stud named Jake Rogers.

380
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,019
Why are people shit talking?

381
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:25,019
Jake Rogers was a total creep.

382
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,019
Nobody liked him. I gotta go

383
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,049
now. Later. Oh my

384
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:36,099
God. Didn't he just

385
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,099
get thrown down a flight of stairs

386
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,099
and died?

387
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:42,099
Hey Nancy, need something?

388
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,099
What do you know about Hulk

389
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,099
Sanchez? He's a big jock on

390
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,099
campus. Never dated him or anything.

391
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,099
Why do we need that info? Why do you

392
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,789
have to say that? I don't

393
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,789
need that info.

394
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,789
Hey, who is this person? Oh, you know, he's a jock.

395
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,789
I never dated him though.

396
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,160
Alright.

397
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,980
Okay. I just asked

398
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,389
you who he was. How well do you

399
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,389
know Daryl Gray?

400
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,389
They both did it.

401
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,389
He's the only guy I'd ever consider dating.

402
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,389
He's student council president,

403
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,389
holds a cool job at a diner called Max scenes,

404
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,389
and drives a CBAC X8.

405
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,389
You're really hammering down the like, who I'm going to date.

406
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,389
Drives a sports car and works at a diner?

407
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,389
That doesn't compute.

408
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,389
Yeah, I don't get it either. Daryl's family

409
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,389
was rich and used to throw major parties all the time.

410
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:33,659
But not anymore.

411
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,150
What is that? I'll talk to you

412
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,150
later. Bye Nancy.

413
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,519
What is that on her neck? Is it like a medal?

414
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,519
Is it like a gold medal? What is that?

415
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,519
Hey Nancy, need something?

416
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,519
See you later.

417
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,519
Bye Nancy. It's an Olympic medal.

418
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:56,199
Is it? Magazine

419
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:03,110
puzzle? Connie the Olympian.

420
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:08,300
Paseo students of the month.

421
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,690
Why is this like

422
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,059
this? Somebody did

423
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,059
this wrong.

424
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,059
September, October, November, December, January,

425
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,059
February, March. Why wouldn't this be in a row?

426
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,829
It's weird

427
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:28,889
in a row. It's a school year.

428
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:30,889
Look at the chat. Look at the chat. Look at the chat.

429
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,639
Look at the chat. Is this a puzzle?

430
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:40,940
What do you want? Alright, that's

431
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,420
What do you even get that image from?

432
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Alright, so maybe I need to remember

433
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,900
this. Alright, well we know that now.

434
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Let's go in here.

435
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
I'm going in. I'm old enough

436
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,900
to go in here. I'm like 37.

437
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
You're not supposed to go in there.

438
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,420
Sorry, blew my cover.

439
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,619
That was a shiny thing.

440
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:22,039
Oh, a quarter. Am I going to softlock

441
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:31,960
myself? She did it.

442
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I didn't do it. She did.

443
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:43,349
She did it. Oh, a quarter.

444
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:53,980
That's some.

445
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,219
Can I nominate

446
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:02,679
that? Oh,

447
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,159
another quarter. No, I might

448
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:12,219
need this. Alright, I have to find this

449
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:22,070
student. Debate

450
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,570
team, math team.

451
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:31,099
Hi, my name's Nancy

452
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,099
Drew. What's your name?

453
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,099
Hal Tanaka. Actually, my first

454
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,099
name is much longer than that.

455
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,099
But I want to fit in here in America.

456
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,099
So I chose Hal as my nickname.

457
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,099
I'm a Japanese exchange

458
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,099
student. Why do you think it's

459
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:47,269
easier to have an American name?

460
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:49,269
I want to be part of the culture and

461
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:54,329
succeed in this country.

462
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,329
Do you plan on staying in America after

463
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,329
you finish high school? My family

464
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:00,329
is counting on me to succeed here.

465
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:02,329
I must make them proud of me.

466
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:04,329
What's your favorite soda?

467
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,889
So what's been going on at school lately?

468
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,889
A murder was committed here.

469
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,889
Everyone is very stressed out.

470
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,889
Alright, so we have a little

471
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:14,889
bit of

472
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:16,889
actual human being here.

473
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:21,110
I heard about that.

474
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,110
Some kid named Jake?

475
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,110
Oh, yeah. Jake Rogers

476
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,110
was a dark soul.

477
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,110
He created a lot of trouble.

478
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,420
What do you mean a dark soul?

479
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,550
What do you mean by dark soul?

480
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,550
Jake wasn't a happy

481
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,550
person and made others around him

482
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,550
very unhappy, too.

483
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,550
How did Jake make people around him unhappy?

484
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,550
This is weird written dialogue.

485
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,550
In English,

486
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,550
you would say a bully.

487
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,550
He wasn't very popular.

488
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,550
I'm behind in my studies and I must get back to the library.

489
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,550
He was the dark soul of

490
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,550
high school students.

491
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,030
Oh,

492
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,849
can I

493
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,030
What's the combination?

494
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,030
Do you know the combination to Jake Rogers' locker?

495
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,030
I'm sorry, Nancy.

496
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,030
I can't help you with that.

497
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,030
How do you not know the combination?

498
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,030
Hoke said your locker is right next to Jake's.

499
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,030
Are you sure you don't know the combination?

500
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,030
Hmm.

501
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,030
I remember one day Jake was mad because

502
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,030
he couldn't open his locker.

503
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,030
He told me he wished he had a phone handy.

504
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,719
Would that help?

505
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:36,059
Phone handy?

506
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:38,059
He told me he wished he had a phone

507
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,880
to do math?

508
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Have you heard of Hoke Sanchez?

509
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Heard of him?

510
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Hoke holds the conference record for quarterback sex.

511
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
He's been the state's number one player

512
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
since he was a freshman.

513
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
He's also a candidate for a big university

514
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
even with his injury.

515
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Injury?

516
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Hoke got hurt a few weeks ago. Ever since that game

517
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
he hasn't played the same.

518
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
I worry that his chances of playing for

519
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
top school are not as good

520
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
as before his injury.

521
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Hmm, interesting.

522
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Do you know Connie Watson?

523
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Yes, we've been in a few classes together.

524
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,400
I think she was dating Jake Rogers.

525
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,579
Yeah, where is this looking out to?

526
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:24,579
They need to mow the grass.

527
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,340
That shit is getting wild.

528
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?

529
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
He's very popular

530
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
and a good politician too.

531
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Just like his father.

532
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,699
Like his father?

533
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:39,699
I hear he was a great politician

534
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,699
but not a very good businessman.

535
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,070
I think his company went bankrupt

536
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,070
a few years ago.

537
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,309
See ya.

538
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:50,309
See you later, Nancy.

539
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:52,679
Here's my phone.

540
00:40:52,679 --> 00:41:14,380
Holy shit, Nancy.

541
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,380
You don't have very many people

542
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
in your phone.

543
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,380
That's it. Just Ned.

544
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,800
Only Ned.

545
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Is this Martha Windeglassen?

546
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Who is please calling me?

547
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Um, no.

548
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I'm trying to reach Ned Nickerson.

549
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Nancy, it's Ned.

550
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I thought with you being undercover and everything

551
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I had to take on a different persona.

552
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Ned, I'm the one who's undercover, not you.

553
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Okay, okay.

554
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
I guess I'll just go undercover vicariously through you.

555
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Which for some odd reason feels very

556
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
deja vu.

557
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Would it probably be a good idea if you didn't

558
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
mention my assignment to anyone?

559
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
You never know who may be related

560
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
to this case, even up at Emerson.

561
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Your secret's safe with me,

562
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,170
along with your heart.

563
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,170
You're such a sweetie.

564
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,170
Enough lovey-dovey talk. It'll make me miss you even more.

565
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,170
So have you found any homicidal secrets yet?

566
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,170
Have we even seen each other in real life?

567
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,199
I feel like we haven't.

568
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,960
Ciao.

569
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Because I'm playing as a senior detective, I don't need a task list.

570
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
What?

571
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,219
Did that.

572
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:35,860
Are you kidding me?

573
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,260
Another coin? Cool.

574
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,260
Another coin in the trash?

575
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,260
There's a lot of coins now.

576
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Alright, let's go back to the locker and see what the hell's going on here.

577
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,090
Alright, he needed a phone.

578
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,289
Why would he need a phone?

579
00:42:55,289 --> 00:43:02,070
He needed a phone.

580
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:08,070
Why would he need a phone for this?

581
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:24,900
Maybe the code is...

582
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
Yeah, maybe it's like...

583
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,170
Why would you put a picture of your...

584
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,840
Maybe take the phone out here?

585
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Zoom?

586
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,130
I don't know, is there anything over here?

587
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,260
Get Hulk to rip the door off.

588
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,550
Maybe it's his phone number.

589
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,110
The last four digits?

590
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,110
I don't think I have that info though.

591
00:43:53,110 --> 00:44:03,530
Who am I calling?

592
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,199
She hangs up. Who hung up?

593
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:34,500
It's Jake.

594
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,289
Oh shit, it was Jake.

595
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:43,289
A treatise on etiquette.

596
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:46,679
There's a ripped up piece of paper in here.

597
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:53,510
What else have we got?

598
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,510
T120.

599
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,510
There's a tape. The tape is gone though.

600
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,030
Judo today.

601
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,030
New judo trends. Tournament winners.

602
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,030
Holds and throws with style.

603
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,590
Masked Marauder flattens foes.

604
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,380
Masked Marauder flattens foes.

605
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:25,659
I don't know anything about judo.

606
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,659
Who's winning here?

607
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,409
Is this guy doing a huge flip

608
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:32,409
over the other guy and ripping him forward?

609
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:34,409
Or is the other guy throwing him over the shoulder?

610
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:36,409
I don't know who's winning.

611
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:50,099
Breaking at local pharmacy.

612
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,780
Paseo County Police responded to a breaking

613
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,780
at the drug station pharmacy on 80th Street

614
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,780
in the early morning hours yesterday.

615
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,780
Whoever it was knew exactly what they were looking for.

616
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,139
They broke in the building

617
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,139
through the back window, took the drugs

618
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:07,139
and were out for minutes.

619
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,139
According to the report, several vials of

620
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,139
hectanol were taken.

621
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,139
We were just lucky that

622
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:15,139
no of the damage was done to the store.

623
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:19,219
What is hectanol?

624
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:21,219
Why was there a coin in the A?

625
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,719
Alright, so we've got

626
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,150
breaking at the pharmacy.

627
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,150
Let's go talk to the pharmacy.

628
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,570
Alright, let's go talk to the pharmacy.

629
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:44,519
Wait! Let's go.

630
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:25,019
This is pretty sick, actually.

631
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:33,510
You know what they haven't made in a long time?

632
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,139
An updated cool

633
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:38,139
version of this game.

634
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:42,300
They keep making the same iPad version.

635
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,199
No, not Peggle.

636
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:53,050
Breakout.

637
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:58,420
Cool Breakout? Yeah.

638
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,860
I remember the best part about

639
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,860
Breakout is when you beat a level

640
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,860
and the ball stayed up top and you just

641
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,860
let it just auto play.

642
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,860
And have it just take out. It just got stuck

643
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,860
on the top row.

644
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,860
And almost the whole level would get completed.

645
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,860
Let's see if we can do it.

646
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,510
Do it. Oh, come on.

647
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:29,929
How many levels are there?

648
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:32,360
Get stuck up there.

649
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,820
Oh wow, this made it real easy.

650
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,820
This is an amateur detective, not a

651
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:43,690
master detective anymore.

652
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,690
Forty hour minigame. Do I get anything

653
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,590
for doing this? I lost. Yeah, it's okay.

654
00:48:49,590 --> 00:49:01,050
You lost our respect.

655
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,269
Don't worry, I'll get it back.

656
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:08,219
I'll get it back when I bag the

657
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:10,219
killer for who threw Jake

658
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:14,309
down the stairs.

659
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:16,309
Probably not tonight though, because this is probably like

660
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:18,309
a 16 hour game.

661
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:21,000
And we're doing, hopefully, no more heroes

662
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,800
tomorrow.

663
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,699
Oh, nice. Alright, I gotta make this work.

664
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:31,940
Get in there. Come on, get in.

665
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,940
In, in, in. No, in, in.

666
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,940
Ah, it's over. I wrote it.

667
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:51,289
It's alright. Is this 700,000

668
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:54,489
games?

669
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,659
It's probably better than

670
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,659
what's on that disc.

671
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:02,380
Is this available on Steam? Yeah, it is.

672
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:11,659
I think all of them are.

673
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:28,489
At least most of them. This is nice.

674
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:30,489
I actually am really, I'm just kind of

675
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:42,519
relaxing now.

676
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:44,820
Yeah, that was pretty good sync.

677
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,820
I'm gonna say there's probably five levels.

678
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,820
And I'm never doing this again, so I might as well try to beat it.

679
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,820
And get the achievement at the end of the game.

680
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,219
We needed

681
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,219
to unwind after that slide puzzle.

682
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,989
Yeah, we needed a good unwind.

683
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:08,309
Which in itself should be an

684
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,309
unwind, but it wasn't.

685
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,769
I can't believe I almost turned the power button

686
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:16,519
off on my computer.

687
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:18,519
I was gonna do it too, and I'm gonna be like, fuck it, I'll see you

688
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:31,449
tomorrow.

689
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:33,449
Almost makes you forget that someone was

690
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:38,440
murdered. Yeah,

691
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
as a detective I shouldn't be doing this.

692
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Shouldn't I have dusted this thing for fingerprints?

693
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,420
God, how many levels are there?

694
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,670
I wanna get it up there.

695
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,909
Come on, do it.

696
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:03,239
Get up there.

697
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:05,539
Get up there.

698
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:18,340
Do I have ten lives?

699
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,340
This is never gonna end.

700
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:28,090
If I could turn my camera on right now, I would.

701
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:33,719
I don't do this very often,

702
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:42,739
but I'm doing it right now.

703
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,739
I'm leaning forward on my desk with my

704
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:46,739
left hand. My left elbow

705
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,739
is on the desk, and my

706
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,739
left hand is on my chin.

707
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:59,130
In a fist, just kinda hanging up.

708
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,130
Why didn't I look?

709
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,130
I wasn't even looking, I looked away.

710
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,300
Now I know why no one's

711
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,300
made another version of this game, because after five

712
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,300
levels you're like, alright, this is, I'm done.

713
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,179
There's a reason why no one has

714
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:14,179
revolutionized the breakout

715
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:32,809
game. Battle Royale

716
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:37,480
Breakout? Alright, there can't

717
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:44,650
be more than ten levels.

718
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,650
You're killing me. You're killing me.

719
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,650
Come on. Alright.

720
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,949
Level six.

721
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:53,500
What does that say?

722
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,800
Eighty...

723
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:01,110
Eighty what?

724
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,250
I gotta sit up.

725
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,250
Alright, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up. I'm starting to not care.

726
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,340
I have to care.

727
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,650
Does Bond?

728
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,650
I wonder if that's a code or something. Maybe that is a code for something.

729
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:27,000
I want a pizza so bad.

730
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,239
I don't, what is it with

731
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,239
streaming? It's something about

732
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,239
streaming. On a day-to-day basis,

733
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,239
I don't want to eat pizza.

734
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,239
But during a stream,

735
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:39,239
I sit here, and I just

736
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,239
think, you know, I just want a full pizza.

737
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:43,239
It's only when I'm streaming.

738
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:50,860
Me too? Do you guys

739
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,659
get that too? Maybe it's a Twitch

740
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,469
thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:04,809
S...

742
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,809
SCK.

743
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:12,360
Suck?

744
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,500
Sucks.

745
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,760
I want to hit those three

746
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
whirlpools. I want to make it harder.

747
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:36,739
It's definitely ten.

748
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,739
Why would it be more than ten?

749
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,500
I guess it's not that hard to make these games

750
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
because once you have the template for them,

751
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
you can make ten thousand of them.

752
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:53,800
Maybe they just never end.

753
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:02,119
Comes in a break. What if it's just randomly generated?

754
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,119
That would be bad.

755
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:14,920
It's the eyes.

756
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
When you get it going sideways, it's good

757
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
shit. It's going sideways.

758
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Come on, do them all.

759
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:34,469
Yeah.

760
00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:37,289
Wii Sports Party Game?

761
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:39,289
Well, let me do No More Heroes first. I gotta get my

762
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:50,619
Wii mode to function.

763
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,619
Only two more levels and I, regardless,

764
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:59,780
I'm done. This is nice, though.

765
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,150
Yeah.

766
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,900
This is the taking a bath

767
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,900
of video games. Level nine.

768
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,809
Speed it up.

769
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,429
That was fast, holy shit.

770
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:31,369
Another sorting

771
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:33,369
algorithm.

772
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:35,670
I almost hit five hundred thousand points.

773
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,309
What kind of bath is like this?

774
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,309
Well, I mean, just the way that my brain is

775
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,309
acting right now. I'm just relaxing.

776
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:50,309
I feel good.

777
00:57:50,309 --> 00:58:05,079
Get all the beaks. You're coming down

778
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:07,079
from the drugs.

779
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:20,409
God damn it.

780
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:22,409
This better

781
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:24,409
be it. This better be it.

782
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:29,659
Is it Y2K?

783
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:55,429
Yes. Is it raining?

784
00:58:55,429 --> 00:59:04,199
No. Maybe in the game.

785
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:06,699
All right. I gotta get back to detective work.

786
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:09,320
This is putting me to sleep.

787
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
And I am not going to sleep without a full pizza.

788
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,320
So like that's not going to happen.

789
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,820
Get to one million points.

790
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:26,699
Damn it. All right.

791
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:28,699
This looks like a final level. Look at this.

792
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,699
This is like original Donkey Kong.

793
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:57,510
Yes.

794
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,710
That's what I wanted.

795
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,710
That's all I wanted.

796
01:00:23,449 --> 01:00:35,539
What about the...

797
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,539
What about the guy that was murdered?

798
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,420
Yeah.

799
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,420
I'll get to it. I promise.

800
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:50,150
Who?

801
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,150
What do you mean? Oh. Who?

802
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,150
I think his name... I don't even remember his name.

803
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:02,980
Jake?

804
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,980
All right. Fine.

805
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,980
You guys want me to test for it? I will.

806
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:11,980
Never mind. I am just too late.

807
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,980
I was going to blow into my Wii mode again.

808
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,980
Oh no.

809
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,980
I have to like brush my teeth.

810
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,980
Oh boy. Oh my god.

811
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,980
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

812
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,980
This is a used Wii mode and I didn't clean it.

813
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,980
And I put it in my mouth like four times.

814
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,980
Ah!

815
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,159
Oh no. No. No.

816
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,159
And there's like stuff on it.

817
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,530
Oh fuck. What happened?

818
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,789
Oh my god.

819
01:01:46,789 --> 01:02:00,980
Oh my fucking god.

820
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,980
I have to brush my fucking teeth right now.

821
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:16,039
You see this?

822
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:19,750
Darn it!

823
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,750
I'll be right back.

824
01:02:21,750 --> 01:04:22,820
I'll be right back.

825
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:27,300
God damn it.

826
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,440
I hate that.

827
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,440
I hate it.

828
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,920
Oh my god.

829
01:04:36,920 --> 01:05:00,860
Oh.

830
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:07,449
It's like in a room with like

831
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,449
a shitload of cigarettes in it.

832
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:12,329
It's yellow.

833
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:16,170
Like it was probably

834
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,170
somebody probably smoked in their house.

835
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:21,429
Look.

836
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:23,429
Somebody probably was just like a smoker

837
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:25,429
and that's like all the smoke filth.

838
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:34,260
That fucking, that shit

839
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,260
was in my mouth and I didn't even clean it.

840
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,260
Oh my god.

841
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,260
How far did I put it in my mouth?

842
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,230
It's Cheetos.

843
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,230
That's somehow worse.

844
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,230
What you just said is worse. I'm just thinking of some

845
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,230
some like fucking kid

846
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,230
with like Cheeto covered hands

847
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,230
always and never washing his hands.

848
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:58,840
No. That's definitely

849
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,840
a cigarette. Oh! That's a cigarette

850
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
stain. That's somebody's fucking

851
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
cigarette fingers.

852
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,780
Fuck.

853
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:24,599
Damn it.

854
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,599
Old plastic turns yellow.

855
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,599
I know but you don't, I put it in my mouth.

856
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:42,170
I just like

857
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,170
I just put somebody's

858
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,170
cigarette fingers in my mouth.

859
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,489
What level is this?

860
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,489
It wasn't on camera. Oh I'm talking about from like

861
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,489
two hours ago. Like three hours ago.

862
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:19,289
That was a delayed reaction.

863
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:43,449
We did get, we got the cool Drupi

864
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:50,230
picture though.

865
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:59,449
Yeah but is that

866
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,449
is that worth getting like

867
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:04,969
is that worth getting like cigarette

868
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:13,739
hepatitis? Yes.

869
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:22,310
This is garage band music.

870
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,130
Alright if

871
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,130
I can't stop at 13 because like that's unlucky.

872
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:29,130
So if it's

873
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:31,130
there's more than 13 probably. I'm

874
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,130
gonna turn my computer off. Five.

875
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,130
Four. Just kidding.

876
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:47,399
Finish the

877
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:53,539
barnacle game.

878
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,539
I fucking

879
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:59,770
fucking can again.

880
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,770
Alright this one. This is it. This is it. I don't care. This is it.

881
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,770
I'm gonna stop at 14. I don't care. I'm done.

882
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:23,079
Mouth. Isn't there a murder solve?

883
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,079
Yes. Eventually. Maybe I

884
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:27,079
will eventually.

885
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:38,920
Once this girl in my eighth grade class

886
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,920
licked a pig heart we were dissecting.

887
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:50,170
Oh wow.

888
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:58,340
Yeah but don't

889
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,479
don't they

890
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:03,479
like dunk those things in acid to

891
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:05,479
clean them? This wee moat was not

892
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:07,479
dunked in like dissecting fluid.

893
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:11,189
Somebody scratched their ass, smoked

894
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:13,189
five packs of cigarettes and put it into a box.

895
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:34,569
Bite into a raw egg

896
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:38,020
to kill the bacteria.

897
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,460
What would that do?

898
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:47,619
I licked the floor

899
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,619
of a school bus once.

900
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:59,100
Why can I see? You know

901
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,100
like images you can

902
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,100
hear. Why can I hear

903
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,489
that story? Like a bunch of kids

904
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:08,489
saying, you want to lick the bottom of the school bus?

905
01:11:08,489 --> 01:11:10,489
Yeah I will. No you won't.

906
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:12,489
Loser.

907
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:14,489
Yeah.

908
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:17,739
He did it. Whoa.

909
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:21,000
I can hear that image.

910
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
The bus driver's like shut the fuck

911
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,819
up back there.

912
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:30,819
The bus driver's just like hey

913
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,260
you little bastards.

914
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,899
Don't touch anything.

915
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:39,140
How dare you

916
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,140
lick my bus.

917
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:44,069
You little shits.

918
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:46,069
Okay I gotta pay attention.

919
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:16,260
I need to say something.

920
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,140
Okay. Can we

921
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,140
give it up

922
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,140
a little bit here and give

923
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,140
the respect that's deserved

924
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,140
to our school bus drivers?

925
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:31,109
The amount of shit

926
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:33,109
that they have to listen to

927
01:12:33,109 --> 01:12:35,109
and the amount of nonsense

928
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:37,109
that they have to potentially put up with.

929
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:39,109
And they've got to pay attention.

930
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,109
They've got to make sure they get these

931
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,109
kids around safely.

932
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,060
That's a pretty

933
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,060
that requires a little bit of

934
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,659
applause.

935
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,659
Because I am

936
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,659
I cannot imagine me ever

937
01:12:56,659 --> 01:13:00,180
in any scenario

938
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,180
where I would be able to pay attention and drive

939
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:21,449
with this going on.

940
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:38,140
Think about it. What the fuck is this?

941
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,439
What a weird gif.

942
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:50,939
Okay. Alright so

943
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:52,939
imagine driving a car and needing to pay attention

944
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:54,939
to this going on. This is why we need to give our respect

945
01:13:54,939 --> 01:14:04,859
to those people.

946
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:11,829
Okay I have to get

947
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:24,180
off at the next exit.

948
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:28,340
Stop!

949
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:49,380
Shut up back there.

950
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:57,640
This is a long video.

951
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:22,729
This is fucking loud.

952
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:37,000
No it's just like an airplane.

953
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,010
That's like an airplane

954
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:43,850
sound. Why would that come up as

955
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:57,609
a car driving?

956
01:15:57,609 --> 01:15:59,609
Okay I don't know why I saw

957
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:01,609
car sounds sleeping.

958
01:16:01,609 --> 01:16:03,850
Car sounds white noise

959
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,850
for sleep. Why would a sleep

960
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:11,100
what are you talking about?

961
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,100
No I can't add all that fucking

962
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:33,640
bullshit. Alright

963
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:41,510
give me a second.

964
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:46,819
No these are cars driving by on the highway.

965
01:16:46,819 --> 01:17:01,989
That's not going to work.

966
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:41,020
Nope. I ain't going there.

967
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,020
I ain't going there.

968
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:49,579
I ain't going there.

969
01:17:49,579 --> 01:18:00,779
Let's try.

970
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:05,399
No

971
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:07,399
there's a stage where that goes

972
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:09,399
too far and I don't want to take it

973
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:11,399
there.

974
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:23,619
Just go!

975
01:18:23,619 --> 01:18:25,619
Just go! Go! Go! Just go! Do the detective

976
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:28,380
case!

977
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,340
Get me out!

978
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,340
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

979
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,340
Out! Out! Out! Out!

980
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:48,619
Hi Nancy. How can I get

981
01:18:48,619 --> 01:18:50,619
into the teacher's lounge? Why is this so loud?

982
01:18:50,619 --> 01:18:54,460
Look Nancy maybe this assignment

983
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,460
isn't for you. I can't be holding your

984
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,460
hand all the time. Your job is to come

985
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,460
to me with solutions not

986
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,460
problems. When the police looked through Jake's

987
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,460
locker did they take a videotape? When the police

988
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,460
looked through Jake's locker did they take

989
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,460
a videotape? No

990
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:12,420
we didn't.

991
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,420
That was a very unconvincing note.

992
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,430
Okay so I need to find the videotape.

993
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:39,479
I would appreciate the

994
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,039
if we got rid of the Mario Kart

995
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:44,039
intro music.

996
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:54,920
Is there anything else in the house?

997
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,920
What the hell am I supposed to do?

998
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:10,550
Besides drink soda.

999
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,550
What the hell do high school kids do?

1000
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,430
Besides walk around and drink soda.

1001
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:19,720
Hey Nancy. Need something?

1002
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,409
Do you know why Jake had an empty

1003
01:20:22,409 --> 01:20:24,409
videocassette case in his locker?

1004
01:20:24,409 --> 01:20:26,409
No. Why are you so interested

1005
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:28,409
in Jake anyway?

1006
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:31,100
I gotta go now. Later. Nancy

1007
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,529
I'm starting to wonder about you.

1008
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:35,529
Didn't I hear you were dating Jake?

1009
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,529
Hey a girl can make a

1010
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:40,149
mistake can't she?

1011
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:42,149
Do you know how Tanaka?

1012
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:44,149
Not very well. He's an exchange student

1013
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:46,149
from Japan and a total workaholic.

1014
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:48,329
He told me he's trying to get

1015
01:20:48,329 --> 01:20:50,329
more scholarships for college.

1016
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:52,329
Lately he's been looking really burnt out.

1017
01:20:52,329 --> 01:20:54,329
I think the pressure's getting to him.

1018
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:56,329
What pressure?

1019
01:20:56,329 --> 01:20:58,329
I guess it's a big deal for his family

1020
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:00,329
that he'd get into a good school on a free ride.

1021
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:03,460
I'll let you go.

1022
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,460
Bye Nancy.

1023
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:10,699
Okay. What's

1024
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,380
to play here? What do I have a key?

1025
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,380
What's this key for? You got it? Wait. Okay.

1026
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,069
What's the key for?

1027
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:20,069
Have I found a key yet?

1028
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:22,310
Have I found a place for this to go?

1029
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,470
Is it the maintenance closet?

1030
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,899
No. This might be a puzzle.

1031
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:40,229
What would it want me to do?

1032
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:45,460
Go to the library? What the hell is the

1033
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:50,710
library? I mean that's the exit.

1034
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:56,460
Other way?

1035
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,460
Down here? Library.

1036
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,859
Library. Library?

1037
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:08,939
This library sucks.

1038
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,159
Do you know why Jake had an

1039
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:15,159
empty video cassette case in his

1040
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:19,899
Yeah I see it. I see it. I see it

1041
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:21,899
and it's beautiful. It's very nice.

1042
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:23,899
It's very very nice. I didn't know Jake was

1043
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:25,899
interested in video. I avoided him

1044
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,899
whenever I could.

1045
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:35,699
Jesus Christ.

1046
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,699
I avoided him whenever I could.

1047
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:39,699
I hated him. He was an asshole. He was a piece of shit.

1048
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:41,699
Nobody liked him. I don't like him.

1049
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,069
He sucked.

1050
01:22:44,069 --> 01:22:46,069
My God.

1051
01:22:54,069 --> 01:23:00,279
Are you in the library?

1052
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:02,710
You're in the library.

1053
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:10,260
That's where you are.

1054
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:19,670
Oh no. Here's a library.

1055
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:24,149
Who locks a school

1056
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:27,609
library?

1057
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:29,609
Is there forbidden knowledge in here? I don't understand.

1058
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:31,609
Monday through Thursday, 8 to 4. I can't go in there.

1059
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:34,170
Yeah I can. Give me that key.

1060
01:23:34,170 --> 01:24:00,390
Fiction. Secret

1061
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:11,000
books? No.

1062
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,970
What is a relic?

1063
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,399
What's a relic? I don't know.

1064
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:19,399
A perfect alibi.

1065
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:29,300
Doesn't seem to be very interesting.

1066
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:34,810
What even is a relic?

1067
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,810
It's weird. I know exactly what a relic is.

1068
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,810
But it's hard for me to describe to you what a relic is.

1069
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,810
It's an old

1070
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,810
piece of an

1071
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,810
old medallion or an old

1072
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,810
crafted thing

1073
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,750
that is

1074
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,750
old and from an old

1075
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,750
culture, an old

1076
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,439
religion.

1077
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:58,439
It's an object

1078
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:00,439
that holds significant potential

1079
01:25:00,439 --> 01:25:10,300
cultural value.

1080
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,619
Where's my

1081
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:15,619
book?

1082
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:20,810
Didn't I read somebody's password?

1083
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:30,729
Catalog search. What am I looking for?

1084
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:44,359
What was the name?

1085
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:49,220
What was the relic?

1086
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:58,439
Check shelf.

1087
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:00,439
Star Wars. It's not going to be a Star Wars book.

1088
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:05,300
This book is something I'm specifically looking for.

1089
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:10,550
I don't know what it is though.

1090
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:12,550
What were some of the other names of those?

1091
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:15,300
I don't think there was a book.

1092
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,180
There was something written down.

1093
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,180
Somebody has a book somewhere.

1094
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,510
Why did the music just change?

1095
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:45,699
What the fuck is going on?

1096
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:47,699
Do I have to look these up?

1097
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,699
There's got to be something about...

1098
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:51,699
What's this one called? The Meltdown?

1099
01:26:51,699 --> 01:26:53,699
Digital Meltdown.

1100
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:55,699
A novel by Jeremy

1101
01:26:55,699 --> 01:26:58,970
Albertson. What's this one called?

1102
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:02,300
The Crystal

1103
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:14,140
Skulls? Jake was here.

1104
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:16,819
Things to remember.

1105
01:27:16,819 --> 01:27:18,819
The answer to my fate lies

1106
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:20,819
in the box.

1107
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,819
A matchbook behind Maxine's

1108
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:24,819
schedule holds the first step.

1109
01:27:24,819 --> 01:27:26,819
My messages hold the remaining

1110
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:28,819
18 steps.

1111
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:31,510
The elements tell the

1112
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,510
order. The letter and

1113
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,510
digit tell the direction.

1114
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,390
J.R.

1115
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:53,289
God, man. U2.

1116
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:56,680
Where is U2?

1117
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:03,720
What element is U2?

1118
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:12,359
No, we've got to go...

1119
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:14,359
Underneath the schedule.

1120
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:17,560
It's an incomplete table.

1121
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,590
Matchbook behind Maxine's schedule.

1122
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:24,340
Well, let's go

1123
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:32,390
Let's go look at that.

1124
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,390
Take a screenshot of this.

1125
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:47,510
Yeah, good idea.

1126
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:53,850
Good call. I hate when it goes to

1127
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,850
this music. It always goes back to this.

1128
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:05,369
Alright, who's

1129
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:07,369
gonna find Maxine?

1130
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:11,460
I always thought they were

1131
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:14,659
gonna make me do another one of those.

1132
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:22,659
Oh no, they might.

1133
01:29:22,659 --> 01:29:28,550
Thank god.

1134
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:34,569
Behind the schedule.

1135
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:45,829
Who the hell is that?

1136
01:29:45,829 --> 01:29:48,010
See you later. Goodbye, Nancy.

1137
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:54,340
Okay, see you later.

1138
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:58,500
Wait, this is a Kevin McLeod zone?

1139
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:16,039
Really? Let's go talk to Mr. Jim.

1140
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:19,739
How's it going?

1141
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,739
Who's Maxine?

1142
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:23,739
Tell me about the robbery at the drug station

1143
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:25,739
pharmacy.

1144
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:27,739
Why would I know about a robbery?

1145
01:30:27,739 --> 01:30:32,090
All I know about is football.

1146
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:34,090
I'm really sorry you got injured.

1147
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:36,090
Does that affect your chances

1148
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,090
of playing college ball?

1149
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:40,090
I had a little sprain, no big deal.

1150
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,090
Within a week, I was better than before

1151
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:44,090
and impressing the football scouts.

1152
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:46,090
I'm as strong as ever.

1153
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:50,819
Anyone that says I'm as strong as ever

1154
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:52,819
usually is about at 40%.

1155
01:30:52,819 --> 01:30:54,819
What can you tell me about Connie Watson?

1156
01:30:54,819 --> 01:30:56,819
She hangs out at the gym a lot. I heard she's been having

1157
01:30:56,819 --> 01:31:00,539
a real tough time.

1158
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,539
Why do you think she hangs out at the gym so much?

1159
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:04,539
I don't know.

1160
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:06,539
She's a pretty good athlete, but never joined any of

1161
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:08,970
Paseo Del Mar's teams.

1162
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,970
Why not?

1163
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:13,529
Not exactly sure.

1164
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:15,529
You said she was having a tough time?

1165
01:31:15,529 --> 01:31:17,529
I heard she's been having some money problems.

1166
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:19,529
Did you take the videocassette from Jake's locker?

1167
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:21,529
Do you know why Jake had an empty videocassette case

1168
01:31:21,529 --> 01:31:23,529
in his locker?

1169
01:31:23,529 --> 01:31:25,529
I didn't pay much attention to Jake.

1170
01:31:25,529 --> 01:31:27,529
I'm tired of talking about that loser.

1171
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:29,529
I'll kill you with my bare teeth.

1172
01:31:29,529 --> 01:31:31,529
Do you know Hal Tanaka?

1173
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:33,529
That dude is always studying.

1174
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,529
He's a huge fan of mine. Real smart guy.

1175
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:37,529
But I never understood why a

1176
01:31:37,529 --> 01:31:39,529
brain like Tanaka would hang out with slime

1177
01:31:39,529 --> 01:31:41,529
like Jake.

1178
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:43,529
Hal was a friend of Jake's?

1179
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:45,529
Why?

1180
01:31:45,529 --> 01:31:47,529
Let's just say I saw them talking together a lot.

1181
01:31:47,529 --> 01:31:49,529
Jake's locker was right next to Hal's.

1182
01:31:49,529 --> 01:31:51,529
But they weren't really friends.

1183
01:31:51,529 --> 01:31:53,529
Is that what you're saying?

1184
01:31:53,529 --> 01:31:55,529
Jake didn't really have friends.

1185
01:31:55,529 --> 01:31:57,529
And Hal, he may seem pretty chill,

1186
01:31:57,529 --> 01:31:59,529
but I've seen him crack a couple of times.

1187
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:01,529
He's seriously uptight.

1188
01:32:01,529 --> 01:32:03,529
Crack a couple of times?

1189
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:05,529
He's got a temper, a bad one.

1190
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:07,529
He lets the pressure build and build until

1191
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,529
he's wound so tight the slightest thing sets him off.

1192
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:11,529
Like last week, I strike him out

1193
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:13,529
and he goes ballistic and charges the mount.

1194
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:15,529
He's got some serious issues.

1195
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,529
Now that I think of it,

1196
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:19,529
last time I saw them together,

1197
01:32:19,529 --> 01:32:21,529
Hal seemed pretty upset.

1198
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:23,529
Goodbye.

1199
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:25,529
Well, we have new info to

1200
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:27,529
bring to...

1201
01:32:27,529 --> 01:32:29,529
I'm not into pushy girls.

1202
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:31,529
Do me a favor and bother someone else.

1203
01:32:31,529 --> 01:32:33,529
I'll talk to you later.

1204
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:35,529
I'm going to drink a Mountain Dew

1205
01:32:35,529 --> 01:32:37,529
just because of that

1206
01:32:37,529 --> 01:32:44,439
dick.

1207
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:46,439
Oh, just regular soda water.

1208
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:55,020
Gross.

1209
01:32:55,020 --> 01:33:01,609
Who would ever buy that?

1210
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:05,000
Cat puke.

1211
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,750
Let's go talk and say,

1212
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,930
hey, so you attacked people.

1213
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:12,810
See ya.

1214
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:15,369
Goodbye, Nancy.

1215
01:33:15,369 --> 01:33:17,369
I need a schedule.

1216
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:21,270
Nancy, I'm starting to wonder about you.

1217
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,270
Have you seen any of those weird messages

1218
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,270
on the bulletin boards?

1219
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:27,270
White Claw?

1220
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,270
Yes, and if I catch the guy who's doing it,

1221
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,270
I bet it's the same person who keeps on setting off

1222
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:33,270
the soda machine alarm.

1223
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:36,979
There's a soda machine alarm?

1224
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:38,979
I guess that comes with a territory

1225
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:40,979
of being a school monitor.

1226
01:33:40,979 --> 01:33:42,979
Normally it's not this hectic.

1227
01:33:42,979 --> 01:33:44,979
When I figure out who's been pulling all these pranks.

1228
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:47,220
Hulk told me

1229
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,220
money's been tight for you these days.

1230
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,220
What a dork!

1231
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,220
Hulk Sanch has doesn't know the first thing about my life.

1232
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:55,220
He needs to get a life and stop talking

1233
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,220
about mine.

1234
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,220
I need to sit before these people in this room

1235
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,220
and sit in each one of these chairs and go fucking hash it out

1236
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,220
and walk away. Seriously.

1237
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,220
See you later. Adios.

1238
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:22,100
Bushcan?

1239
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,100
The soda can't just be for fun.

1240
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:31,000
Can it?

1241
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,619
Looking for the schedule.

1242
01:34:33,619 --> 01:34:35,619
Somebody had a schedule we needed to look behind.

1243
01:34:35,619 --> 01:34:37,619
Maybe on a bulletin board?

1244
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:41,829
Wait a minute. What's that?

1245
01:34:41,829 --> 01:34:47,399
Meet in the parking lot at 9 in the morning.

1246
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:49,399
Pippen will take place to survey the Dresden Reservoir.

1247
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:52,789
Brass set for later.

1248
01:34:52,789 --> 01:34:54,789
L-A-U-2.

1249
01:34:54,789 --> 01:35:01,770
Uh, okay.

1250
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:07,720
Well, there's the U-2.

1251
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,300
Yeah, why are there only three people in this school?

1252
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:17,130
It's gonna be real easy to narrow down

1253
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:19,130
who killed Jake, considering there's only

1254
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,130
four people in the game.

1255
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:29,510
It's a 25% chance to get it right.

1256
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:38,149
Announcements.

1257
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,289
Student bulletin board.

1258
01:35:41,289 --> 01:35:45,060
Attention. Wait.

1259
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,060
The Roaring Girl.

1260
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,619
A Jacobean comedy.

1261
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,619
Talk to Deception. A poetic drama written by

1262
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:53,619
the senior essay winners of

1263
01:35:53,619 --> 01:35:55,619
The student files under lock and key

1264
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:57,619
will show the lies of the doctor to be

1265
01:35:57,619 --> 01:35:59,619
H-F-L-1.

1266
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:02,500
I feel like this shit is important somehow.

1267
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:22,090
Something about the elements?

1268
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:26,060
I have no idea.

1269
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,060
Why would I need to be, why could I look at this?

1270
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:35,350
Take a picture of it?

1271
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:39,189
Is there anything else I can go in town?

1272
01:36:39,189 --> 01:36:41,189
I feel like I'm just trapped here.

1273
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:45,609
What can I do for you?

1274
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:48,550
Do you know why Jake had an empty

1275
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:50,550
video cassette case in his locker?

1276
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,550
Why were you in Jake's locker?

1277
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:56,250
It was

1278
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:58,250
open and I just looked through it.

1279
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,250
Oh.

1280
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:04,979
I have no idea.

1281
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:06,979
What else can I do for you?

1282
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:11,020
Didn't I hear that you

1283
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:13,020
found Jake's body?

1284
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,020
Yeah, I did.

1285
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,020
The student council president gets keys

1286
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,020
to the school. We had an early morning

1287
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:21,020
council meeting and

1288
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,020
I found him lying there. It was the worst

1289
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:25,020
thing I ever experienced in my life.

1290
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,020
And I really don't want to

1291
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:33,739
think about it right now.

1292
01:37:33,739 --> 01:37:35,739
Do you know Connie Watson?

1293
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:37,739
Not that well. She keeps to herself

1294
01:37:37,739 --> 01:37:39,739
a lot. I've always thought

1295
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:41,739
there's something mysterious about

1296
01:37:41,739 --> 01:37:43,739
her. Kind of the same way

1297
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,739
I feel about you.

1298
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:47,739
$1.30 for a ham sandwich?

1299
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:50,680
That's pretty cool.

1300
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,680
How well do you know Hulk Sanchez?

1301
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,680
Big guy, big muscles,

1302
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,680
big dreams. A lot of

1303
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,680
football scouts have been coming over to watch and play.

1304
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,680
He must be under a lot of pressure

1305
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,680
to perform. What can you tell me about

1306
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,680
Hal Tanaka?

1307
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,680
Hal's an exchange student who's all scholarships

1308
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,680
and study. He's very

1309
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,680
intense about becoming a doctor.

1310
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,680
How much ketchup can you drink in 10 seconds?

1311
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,680
Talk to you later.

1312
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:22,869
Impress me. See ya.

1313
01:38:22,869 --> 01:38:26,460
Can I go in the back? I didn't even

1314
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:32,859
know I could go back here. That's just

1315
01:38:32,859 --> 01:38:35,100
very realistic. That's a pretty

1316
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,189
realistic looking knife.

1317
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:42,260
Cooking minigame, I hope so.

1318
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,260
Payday, payday, payday, payday.

1319
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,260
Hmm, looks like something

1320
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,260
was removed here.

1321
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,260
Didn't I find it in his locker? Wasn't it in the corner?

1322
01:38:50,260 --> 01:39:04,600
First aid? No.

1323
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:12,279
He's on the schedule, yeah.

1324
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:16,619
Hold on, let me see that again.

1325
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:18,619
Behind, right, behind the

1326
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:22,010
schedule, right?

1327
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:24,010
Didn't say the clue was behind Maxine's

1328
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:28,229
schedule? T-E-L-

1329
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:31,369
three, where is it?

1330
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:36,170
T-E-L-three.

1331
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,170
C-ki

1332
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:40,170
ichi.

1333
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:44,520
What is that? What does that mean, though?

1334
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:51,500
He's not looking at those edits? I'll look at

1335
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:57,109
one. Pretty good.

1336
01:39:57,109 --> 01:40:03,130
Pretty good. What am I supposed to do with this?

1337
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:14,439
Boop boop boop.

1338
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:20,460
Boop boop boop. So I have it, now what?

1339
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:30,439
Yeah, that's good. No, fuck off, says

1340
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:32,439
German 985. When did I do

1341
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:42,869
that? What does this mean?

1342
01:40:42,869 --> 01:40:48,119
Is that numbers?

1343
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:50,119
Typed like C-E-E?

1344
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:52,550
Or...

1345
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:59,260
I don't know. I don't get it.

1346
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,260
That's braille, right? But

1347
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,010
what do I need that for?

1348
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:07,590
What about the periodic table?

1349
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:11,369
See ya. Farewell, Nancy.

1350
01:41:11,369 --> 01:41:14,439
It's Eric from High School. Remember me?

1351
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:16,439
Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in English

1352
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:18,439
class. Sorry, you're just an easy target.

1353
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:20,680
I cannot see much to change.

1354
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,680
Remember Jenny, the girl you had a crush on when we were

1355
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,680
married? I now make over $200,000

1356
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,680
a year.

1357
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,680
And I drive a really expensive car. I guess something

1358
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,680
never changed. Holland Loser, that's catching up. LOL

1359
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,680
Pathetic. I made more money than you.

1360
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,840
In the last, like,

1361
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,270
14 days.

1362
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:42,539
So, um...

1363
01:41:42,539 --> 01:41:49,260
Cool, good luck.

1364
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,260
That's not even true.

1365
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,260
I can't perpetuate that one.

1366
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:57,859
That means

1367
01:41:57,859 --> 01:41:59,859
I make like fucking $70,000,000

1368
01:41:59,859 --> 01:42:05,369
a year. I need to go

1369
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:07,369
to the pier- Alright, I'm about to turn it off.

1370
01:42:07,369 --> 01:42:10,819
I need to get- I'm gonna go- I'm- I'm-

1371
01:42:10,819 --> 01:42:12,819
My pizza levels are at a dangerous

1372
01:42:12,819 --> 01:42:24,579
level. What's that?

1373
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:44,470
Wait, how do I flip it? I can't

1374
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:53,109
flip it? Flip your head.

1375
01:42:53,109 --> 01:43:02,119
This isn't-

1376
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:04,119
Nowhere to turn to, nowhere to hide.

1377
01:43:04,119 --> 01:43:06,359
Let the books in the

1378
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:08,359
library be your answer guide.

1379
01:43:08,359 --> 01:43:11,750
Okay.

1380
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,180
It- This is-

1381
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:19,880
This is mirrored.

1382
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:38,060
That- Hold on, it's mirrored.

1383
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:40,359
Okay, got a picture.

1384
01:43:40,359 --> 01:43:42,359
Now, can you flip horizontally in

1385
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:48,949
iPhone? You can't.

1386
01:43:48,949 --> 01:43:52,090
Just mirror OBS.

1387
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:54,090
Oh, right, I use mirror OBS.

1388
01:43:54,090 --> 01:44:10,340
Uh, nowhere to turn to,

1389
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,340
nowhere to hide. No- Wait, what?

1390
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:21,369
Transform.

1391
01:44:21,369 --> 01:44:25,779
Flip horizontal.

1392
01:44:25,779 --> 01:44:33,590
That- What is going on?

1393
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:35,590
That someone-

1394
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:37,590
That someone must-

1395
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:39,770
Why is this wrong?

1396
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:45,590
The letters- It's the placement

1397
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,590
of the letters.

1398
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:56,420
That someone must

1399
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,859
hide

1400
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:00,859
reflects big

1401
01:45:00,859 --> 01:45:04,060
secret.

1402
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:08,090
Worn with

1403
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,329
great pride.

1404
01:45:10,329 --> 01:45:13,399
A symbol of

1405
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:17,289
jank.

1406
01:45:17,289 --> 01:45:26,739
A symbol of

1407
01:45:26,739 --> 01:45:31,210
kanji.

1408
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:33,210
Wait, the thing around her neck?

1409
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:36,539
That medallion, right?

1410
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:39,479
Now, what's this last one?

1411
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:43,430
Took it

1412
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:46,699
to bib.

1413
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:49,319
I have to go eat a pizza.

1414
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:56,420
Took it- Took it to

1415
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,689
bib.

1416
01:45:59,689 --> 01:46:01,689
I had to- It's upside down though.

1417
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:06,300
Flip it upside down.

1418
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:10,199
Yeah, it's time to get a pizza.

1419
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:14,170
Let me look at it here. He did what it took to make

1420
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:16,170
the grade, even if it meant cheating to keep up

1421
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:21,609
his charade.

1422
01:46:21,609 --> 01:46:30,060
Talking about me?

1423
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,060
Alright, so we gotta talk- We gotta talk to, um,

1424
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,060
that-

1425
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,060
the lady in here. I'm gonna sneeze.

1426
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:38,060
I can do about it.

1427
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:43,939
Alright, let's go talk about the necklace.

1428
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:49,579
It's almost time for me to get a pizza.

1429
01:46:49,579 --> 01:46:58,470
Close.

1430
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:06,470
Where was she sitting again? I don't even remember.

1431
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:09,859
Okay, hey, what's with the medallion?

1432
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:31,300
What is this?

1433
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:39,880
What does it say?

1434
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,880
Okay, it looks like

1435
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,880
I need to get- I wanna see.

1436
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,500
No, I'm trying to get a picture of the medallion!

1437
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,500
Oh my god.

1438
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:58,890
What does this mean, too?

1439
01:48:05,989 --> 01:48:07,989
Probably get rid of you so I can go in here.

1440
01:48:07,989 --> 01:48:11,319
You're eating pizza right now?

1441
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:16,250
I've never been more jealous in my whole life.

1442
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:20,020
What kind of pizza is it, though?

1443
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:22,520
Talk to me.

1444
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:28,010
Best pizza on Earth

1445
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:30,010
is very, very thin,

1446
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:32,250
crispy, thin crust.

1447
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,250
And I'm talking paper thin.

1448
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:36,250
Pepperoni pizza.

1449
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:38,250
That's it. Don't put any of the junk on it.

1450
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,489
Just a super thin,

1451
01:48:40,489 --> 01:48:42,489
crispy pepperoni pizza.

1452
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:48,380
I don't want anything else on it.

1453
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,869
Don't load it up with hamburger meat

1454
01:48:50,869 --> 01:48:53,050
and onions and garlic and bacon

1455
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:55,050
and salami.

1456
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:57,670
Because then it's not a pizza anymore.

1457
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,670
You're eating

1458
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:01,670
spaghetti and meatballs

1459
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:05,640
at that point.

1460
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:13,579
You might as well just put it all in a bowl and eat it out of a bowl.

1461
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:15,750
Because the thing just falls apart.

1462
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,750
If you get a meatlovers pizza, don't eat

1463
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,750
meatlovers pizza, seriously.

1464
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:23,640
They're just making a joke.

1465
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,640
Because you pick it up and you lift it up

1466
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,640
and it goes- here, I'll give you an example.

1467
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:30,260
So you pick up a piece of pizza that's

1468
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:32,260
meatlovers, right? I just picked it up.

1469
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,260
This is the top. This is the crust.

1470
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,260
So I pick it up and it goes like this.

1471
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:38,260
And everything just falls off into the plate.

1472
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,260
And then you go, oh shit, oh well.

1473
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,260
Looks like I'm eating a piece of wet paper

1474
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:45,850
with spaghetti sauce on it.

1475
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,850
What's that down there?

1476
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,850
The shit that I paid for? I'll eat it with a fork later.

1477
01:49:49,850 --> 01:50:04,869
You have to fold it.

1478
01:50:04,869 --> 01:50:06,869
Oh, sure. Let me go ahead and

1479
01:50:06,869 --> 01:50:08,869
let me fold the pizza now.

1480
01:50:08,869 --> 01:50:10,869
Let's fold it in half. And then when I bite into it,

1481
01:50:10,869 --> 01:50:12,869
like this,

1482
01:50:12,869 --> 01:50:14,869
all the toppings mush out

1483
01:50:14,869 --> 01:50:16,869
into my face and go all over me

1484
01:50:16,869 --> 01:50:18,869
and burn the fuck out of me.

1485
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:20,869
Like, ow! And it falls down

1486
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:22,869
on the plate and there it goes again.

1487
01:50:22,869 --> 01:50:25,500
If you- no, don't say we.

1488
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,500
That's why I didn't do it, because I had touched it.

1489
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,760
If you fold a pizza that has a ton of toppings on it,

1490
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,760
all the toppings just mush out out of the top.

1491
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:43,960
He's never eaten- do I have to

1492
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,960
order a meatlovers pizza and eat it?

1493
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,390
To show you that-

1494
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:50,699
where are you getting your meatlovers pizzas?

1495
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:59,270
They're loaded with toppings!

1496
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:03,939
You're a crackhead. You don't eat tacos.

1497
01:51:03,939 --> 01:51:05,939
Tacos are messy too, but they're good.

1498
01:51:05,939 --> 01:51:07,939
No, I'm not doing it on stream right now.

1499
01:51:07,939 --> 01:51:09,939
Alright, fine. How about this? I promise.

1500
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:11,939
Listen, time stamp this.

1501
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:14,180
I will eat

1502
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:16,739
a big meatlovers pizza.

1503
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:18,739
Not the whole thing, but just enough for me to prove

1504
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:20,739
that they're a fucking mess.

1505
01:51:20,739 --> 01:51:24,520
Not tomorrow. We're doing Normal Heroes tomorrow.

1506
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,020
It'll be its own stream.

1507
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:29,020
The stream will just be titled

1508
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:31,020
Dickhead Eats a Pizza

1509
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:45,859
to prove a non-existent point.

1510
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:47,859
Alright, see you tomorrow. I'm out.

1511
01:51:47,859 --> 01:51:49,859
I'm going to get a pizza.

1512
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:51,859
I'm going to get a pizza. Now we talked about it. Now I want one.

1513
01:51:51,859 --> 01:52:03,260
Boo, boo, boo.

1514
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,260
Five hour stream because

1515
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,199
Hungry Boomer. No.

1516
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:10,199
Five hour stream because I couldn't get

1517
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:12,199
no more heroes to work.

1518
01:52:12,199 --> 01:52:14,199
I still have- I thought this was a good one.

1519
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:16,199
I had a lot of fun playing Nancy Drew.

1520
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:18,199
Maybe not this one, but the last one. Eh, this one too.

1521
01:52:18,199 --> 01:52:20,199
At least first- I liked it.

1522
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:22,699
But we keep talking.

1523
01:52:22,699 --> 01:52:24,699
You guys messed it up. You talked about pizza too many times.

1524
01:52:24,699 --> 01:52:26,699
The second you bring up pizza, I'm going to leave. You know that, right?

1525
01:52:31,069 --> 01:52:33,069
If you guys want

1526
01:52:33,069 --> 01:52:35,069
more than, you know, six, seven hour streams,

1527
01:52:35,069 --> 01:52:37,069
don't say the word pizza in the chat.

1528
01:52:37,069 --> 01:52:39,949
How many times have I looked over here

1529
01:52:39,949 --> 01:52:41,949
when someone's like, oh man, I really want a pizza tonight.

1530
01:52:41,949 --> 01:52:43,949
And I go, oh cool, me too.

1531
01:52:43,949 --> 01:52:48,689
And the stream ends in like 40 minutes.

1532
01:52:48,689 --> 01:52:50,689
That's happened at least three or four times in the last six months.

1533
01:52:55,229 --> 01:52:57,229
It's our fault.

1534
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:59,600
What topping should I get? I told you.

1535
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,899
Pepperoni.

1536
01:53:01,899 --> 01:53:04,779
Cheese with the nice

1537
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:06,779
tangy sauce. Crispy.

1538
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:08,779
It's gotta be crispy.

1539
01:53:08,779 --> 01:53:10,779
It's gotta be crispy.

1540
01:53:10,779 --> 01:53:12,779
None of this folded.

1541
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:14,779
No, no, no. I want it when I bite into it to sound like

1542
01:53:14,779 --> 01:53:16,779
a fucking goddamn potato chip

1543
01:53:16,779 --> 01:53:18,779
cartoon commercial.

1544
01:53:18,779 --> 01:53:28,060
I want to bite into that crust

1545
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:30,500
and have it be like

1546
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:36,899
this. I don't like doughy

1547
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:41,569
ass pizza. I want it to be like

1548
01:53:41,569 --> 01:53:55,329
this. Maybe, okay, maybe not-

1549
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,329
that's not like someone chewing on sand. Maybe not

1550
01:53:57,329 --> 01:54:06,670
that crunchy. Dude, people-

1551
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:09,420
Here's another thing that's weird.

1552
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,420
It is 50-50 split

1553
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,109
whether or not people

1554
01:54:14,109 --> 01:54:16,109
want to instantly throw up when they-

1555
01:54:16,109 --> 01:54:18,109
like somebody crunching

1556
01:54:18,109 --> 01:54:20,109
on something is instant-

1557
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:22,109
instantaneous.

1558
01:54:22,109 --> 01:54:24,109
Just vile

1559
01:54:24,109 --> 01:54:26,420
reaction. And then there are other people that go,

1560
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:31,920
oh, do that again.

1561
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,920
I remember I was eating chocolate one time

1562
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,920
on stream. This is like three- I don't know why I remember this.

1563
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,920
This is like three years ago. And I was eating

1564
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,920
Reese's chocolate or something.

1565
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,930
And there was like

1566
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:44,930
at least a bunch of people- there was a bunch of people that were saying

1567
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:46,930
dude, you're fucking disgusting.

1568
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:48,930
Like stop- I don't want to hear that.

1569
01:54:48,930 --> 01:55:00,699
And I had to mute a bunch of times.

1570
01:55:00,699 --> 01:55:06,210
Was that a dream? No, it wasn't.

1571
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:12,420
Chew with- I was.

1572
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,420
I swear to god.

1573
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:26,239
Mute your mic while you eat.

1574
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:28,239
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1575
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:30,239
I'm gonna put the can on this one tonight. We're gonna start

1576
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:35,619
No More Heroes tomorrow.

1577
01:55:35,619 --> 01:55:37,619
The viewers are dying. Well, I did-

1578
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:41,140
I did just say the stream was over.

1579
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:43,140
No More Heroes starts tomorrow. We're going- we're going four days in a row, by the way.

1580
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:45,140
I didn't- did I mention that?

1581
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:49,300
I don't think I did.

1582
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,300
The reason why I didn't stream the last three, four days in a row

1583
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,300
is because I was getting the New Year's Eve stuff ready.

1584
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,300
And that stuff is almost all ready.

1585
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,600
So we can just go four days in a row.

1586
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,600
You'll have No More Heroes tomorrow,

1587
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,600
maybe No More Heroes again, depending on if I

1588
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,600
do that on Monday. And then New Year's Eve

1589
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,600
stream on 31st.

1590
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:13,279
More Nancy. I don't think

1591
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:15,279
there'll be time for it tomorrow or the next day.

1592
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:18,539
Maybe I'll get a pizza on New Year's.

1593
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:20,539
That's not a bad idea. What a good idea.

1594
01:56:20,539 --> 01:56:22,779
Alright, fine. I'll get- I'll get a pizza

1595
01:56:22,779 --> 01:56:25,220
and I'm gonna eat it on stream.

1596
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,220
I'm gonna get burnt. I already know it. Alright, I gotta be careful

1597
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:29,220
on that one. Alright guys, I'll see you

1598
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,220
tomorrow. Thanks for sticking around.

1599
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,390
Now we're gonna go over the

1600
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:35,390
subs and bits and everything, so don't worry.

1601
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:42,819
And stick around if you want.

1602
01:56:42,819 --> 01:56:44,819
Sort of an impromptu Nancy Drew stream because

1603
01:56:44,819 --> 01:56:46,819
last second I couldn't get my Wiimote

1604
01:56:46,819 --> 01:56:48,819
to work, but it's kinda

1605
01:56:48,819 --> 01:56:50,989
what I plan on doing tomorrow.

1606
01:56:50,989 --> 01:56:52,989
Is making sure I can get it to function.

1607
01:56:52,989 --> 01:56:55,739
If I can't, then we're just gonna have

1608
01:56:55,739 --> 01:56:57,739
to boot up the old Wii.

1609
01:56:57,739 --> 01:57:04,260
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great

1610
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:08,289
night. Those of you sticking around,

1611
01:57:08,289 --> 01:57:17,300
let's talk about bits.

1612
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,300
Shall we? Uh,

1613
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,300
Melatonin Dream Boy, thanks for the 500 bits.

1614
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:25,569
Uh, no message, just

1615
01:57:25,569 --> 01:57:28,699
500 bits, thank you. Uh, thank you

1616
01:57:28,699 --> 01:57:30,699
Heavymen for the 300 bits. No More Heroes is

1617
01:57:30,699 --> 01:57:32,699
one of my favorite franchises.

1618
01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:34,699
And I'd be sure happy to see you play it.

1619
01:57:34,699 --> 01:57:36,699
I'd recommend playing the Wii versions

1620
01:57:36,699 --> 01:57:38,699
on the original hardware since they can be both

1621
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:40,699
up for like 10 bucks.

1622
01:57:40,699 --> 01:57:42,699
Uh, never experienced emulating it though.

1623
01:57:42,699 --> 01:57:44,699
Also, difficulty is really not that bad on normal mode

1624
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:46,699
and the controls are easier to control on the Wii mode than you think.

1625
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:48,699
You can also use the Wii Classic controller

1626
01:57:48,699 --> 01:57:50,699
if you don't want to deal with the motion controls.

1627
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:52,699
Uh, I've, I played No More Heroes 1

1628
01:57:52,699 --> 01:57:54,699
and 2 a long time ago.

1629
01:57:54,699 --> 01:57:56,699
Uh, I love these games.

1630
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,699
They're a little janky and a little wonky.

1631
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:00,699
But, um,

1632
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:02,699
I wanted to

1633
01:58:02,699 --> 01:58:07,300
do them both,

1634
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,300
but I didn't want to split it

1635
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:11,300
up to do PS3 because it's a better version

1636
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:13,300
and runs better and then go to Wii

1637
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:15,300
and it runs like crap. And I'd rather

1638
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,300
them just both be

1639
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:19,729
um, streamed

1640
01:58:19,729 --> 01:58:26,060
through the PC. Because I can make the resolution

1641
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:28,060
better, I can make it look a lot better

1642
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,060
because the Wii version, I know we were

1643
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,060
we were memeing

1644
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,060
on, um,

1645
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,689
the original version. But it

1646
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:38,689
really does run like crap

1647
01:58:38,689 --> 01:58:40,689
in a lot of places from what I remember.

1648
01:58:40,689 --> 01:58:42,689
If you hit somebody with your, uh,

1649
01:58:42,689 --> 01:58:44,689
blade and their blood blows up

1650
01:58:44,689 --> 01:58:46,689
out of their head, I remember it specifically

1651
01:58:46,689 --> 01:58:48,689
chugging down to like 10 frames a second

1652
01:58:48,689 --> 01:58:50,689
half the time. So

1653
01:58:50,689 --> 01:58:53,180
I'd like to run it in his best

1654
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,180
way to present it to people.

1655
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,180
The PS3 runs

1656
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:59,180
worse like crap, really. Well then they

1657
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:01,180
both do. So then even better reason

1658
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:03,180
to not stream it on original hardware.

1659
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:07,340
Because I did walk around

1660
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,340
in it very, very briefly.

1661
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,340
And it seems to run pretty well

1662
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,340
on the settings I have now on PC.

1663
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:16,159
Through emulation.

1664
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:19,359
Riding the bike through town will be rough. Yeah,

1665
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:23,970
it always is though. Uh, but

1666
01:59:23,970 --> 01:59:25,970
yeah, it's, um,

1667
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:27,970
it should be a great experience. It's a really fun game. It's a really

1668
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:32,060
interesting game. I'm looking

1669
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:34,060
forward to it. To return to it again.

1670
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:36,939
Uh, Heavymin.

1671
01:59:36,939 --> 01:59:40,590
That was you. Thank you

1672
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:42,590
again for 300 bits. I don't know why it does

1673
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:44,590
this sometimes. Like I lose, there it is.

1674
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:48,239
Thank you. Hate

1675
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:50,239
sucks. Hate

1676
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:52,239
sucks. No, it was me. It was

1677
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:54,239
not you. Uh, thanks for the thousand

1678
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,239
bits, hate. They say DruCru. That's

1679
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,239
right. It was the last minute DruCru.

1680
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:02,340
Thank you so much for the

1681
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:04,340
ten dollars thousand bits from hate.

1682
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:08,369
Dark Souls, thanks for the 250

1683
02:00:08,369 --> 02:00:10,369
bits. Do you think one day we'll get a lifting

1684
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:12,369
stream where you do a workout set?

1685
02:00:12,369 --> 02:00:14,369
Uh, like getting slimed for

1686
02:00:14,369 --> 02:00:16,369
doing something chat predicts. Assuming the doctors

1687
02:00:16,369 --> 02:00:18,369
can put your Humpty Dumpty streamer back together

1688
02:00:18,369 --> 02:00:21,630
well enough.

1689
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,630
Uh, probably not for a while. I, I have

1690
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:25,630
to get 20, okay,

1691
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:27,630
2020 is the year for me.

1692
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:30,189
Is what I'm gonna be doing

1693
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:32,189
physical therapy. I have to

1694
02:00:32,189 --> 02:00:34,189
figure out what's going on with my body.

1695
02:00:34,189 --> 02:00:36,819
2020 is the

1696
02:00:36,819 --> 02:00:39,569
get healthy year. It's not like

1697
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:41,569
I've been living an unhealthy lifestyle or anything.

1698
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,569
It's just for some reason a lot of things have compounded

1699
02:00:43,569 --> 02:00:45,569
on top of each other.

1700
02:00:45,569 --> 02:00:47,569
The last year. So I

1701
02:00:47,569 --> 02:00:49,569
am gonna do everything necessary to get

1702
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:51,569
100% healthy again.

1703
02:00:51,569 --> 02:00:54,060
And whatever that means, whatever procedures

1704
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:56,060
or treatments or therapy that I

1705
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:58,060
have to do for

1706
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:00,060
my rib cage or whatever

1707
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:02,060
the fuck is wrong with me and my hernia.

1708
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:04,060
I might just have surgery. I might just

1709
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:06,880
go do it.

1710
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,880
A hiatal hernia doesn't go away.

1711
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,880
It gets

1712
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,250
worse until you get surgery.

1713
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:15,619
So I might just go do

1714
02:01:15,619 --> 02:01:18,880
it, just get it over with. The surgery

1715
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,880
is a simple procedure. It's

1716
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,880
fine in like four days

1717
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,819
or something. Cause I feel like there's a bunch

1718
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:27,819
of issues that are kind of stacking on top

1719
02:01:27,819 --> 02:01:30,449
of each other. But we'll find out.

1720
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:33,899
I have a couple of appointments coming up.

1721
02:01:33,899 --> 02:01:35,899
And then we'll talk about maybe doing

1722
02:01:35,899 --> 02:01:40,380
some more of that stuff. We'll see.

1723
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:44,210
But appreciate the 250.

1724
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:46,210
Fitty. Thanks for the 500 bits, Fitty.

1725
02:01:46,210 --> 02:01:48,579
Hey, Jerma, this site shows your

1726
02:01:48,579 --> 02:01:50,579
net worth. Can you give me some investment

1727
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:53,649
advice? You seem

1728
02:01:53,649 --> 02:01:55,649
to be quite successful. Worth of the

1729
02:01:55,649 --> 02:02:01,659
web. What the fuck is this?

1730
02:02:01,659 --> 02:02:03,659
How much is

1731
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:05,659
youtube.com slash user slash

1732
02:02:05,659 --> 02:02:08,029
Jerma985 worth? You can

1733
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:10,029
find the estimated website value for

1734
02:02:10,029 --> 02:02:12,029
Jerma985 in US dollars.

1735
02:02:12,029 --> 02:02:15,869
What is it? Oh.

1736
02:02:15,869 --> 02:02:17,869
102 billion dollars.

1737
02:02:17,869 --> 02:02:21,840
102 billion

1738
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,840
650 million dollars.

1739
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:38,029
Wow. That's pretty good.

1740
02:02:38,029 --> 02:02:41,039
How much is amazon.com

1741
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:43,539
worth? Amazon

1742
02:02:43,539 --> 02:02:47,890
dot com. Okay.

1743
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:51,539
Amazon.com is worth

1744
02:02:51,539 --> 02:02:55,439
4.8 billion dollars.

1745
02:02:55,439 --> 02:03:00,430
That's cool with me.

1746
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:02,430
I'm okay being worth

1747
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:04,430
like 50 Amazons.

1748
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:15,060
Buy Amazon now.

1749
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:20,560
Dude, that guy from English class.

1750
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
Yeah, that guy from English class. Ain't got nothing

1751
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,560
on me. Did you see that website?

1752
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:33,520
Yeah, man. I got 200k.

1753
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,520
I got this awesome

1754
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,520
life. What about you?

1755
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,520
Hey, I'm worth 102 billion dollars.

1756
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,229
Mr. English class.

1757
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:50,590
That's wild though. I don't even know

1758
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:52,590
how is it even calculating that?

1759
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:55,470
Little Wolfie. Thanks for the 850. Cheating

1760
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:57,470
bits. 850 bits from Little Wolfie.

1761
02:03:57,470 --> 02:04:00,029
Is that bits because

1762
02:04:00,029 --> 02:04:02,029
I cheated or bits for me to not cheat?

1763
02:04:02,029 --> 02:04:12,079
I wonder. Jerma.org is only

1764
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:14,079
worth 150 dollars.

1765
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:19,069
It was a bit bounty.

1766
02:04:19,069 --> 02:04:28,979
Thank you.

1767
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:30,979
Thank you Lula. Lula

1768
02:04:30,979 --> 02:04:32,979
Moore for the thousand bits. Ten bucks.

1769
02:04:32,979 --> 02:04:34,979
Hey, Jerma. I've been a long time sub and

1770
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:36,979
fan. I was watching YouTube with my son

1771
02:04:36,979 --> 02:04:38,979
the other day and without being prompted

1772
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:40,979
he asked to watch some of your videos.

1773
02:04:40,979 --> 02:04:42,979
He said, Jerma is amazing.

1774
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:44,979
He's so hilarious. I wish I could be that funny

1775
02:04:44,979 --> 02:04:46,979
someday. I just thought it was cute

1776
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:48,979
and a testament to your content that me, a 34

1777
02:04:48,979 --> 02:04:50,979
year old mom boomer

1778
02:04:50,979 --> 02:04:52,979
and my kid both

1779
02:04:52,979 --> 02:04:54,979
think you're hilarious. P.S.

1780
02:04:54,979 --> 02:04:56,979
He peed his pants from laughing.

1781
02:04:56,979 --> 02:04:58,979
It was gross. Love the stream

1782
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:02,109
and content. Happy New Year.

1783
02:05:02,109 --> 02:05:08,960
Happy New Year to you as well. He's

1784
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,930
so hilarious. I gotta

1785
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:15,229
stop swearing. I gotta stop swearing.

1786
02:05:15,229 --> 02:05:17,229
Think of the children. You know what I mean?

1787
02:05:17,229 --> 02:05:19,229
And I gotta stop pretending to

1788
02:05:19,229 --> 02:05:21,229
stand up over my desk and pee into a cup.

1789
02:05:21,229 --> 02:05:23,229
You know, I just have to figure that

1790
02:05:23,229 --> 02:05:28,350
out too. I gotta clean my act up

1791
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:35,329
a little bit. That will literally never

1792
02:05:35,329 --> 02:05:37,329
happen. If you think I'm smart enough to be able to put a

1793
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:39,329
filter on some of the things that I say,

1794
02:05:39,329 --> 02:05:41,329
you're sadly mistaken.

1795
02:05:41,329 --> 02:05:43,630
I tried it. I tried it

1796
02:05:43,630 --> 02:05:46,380
for like a year or two. Didn't work.

1797
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:50,859
Dude, he's got no filter.

1798
02:05:50,859 --> 02:05:52,859
I say what I want.

1799
02:05:52,859 --> 02:05:56,060
No filter. That's when

1800
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:58,060
like every single person in the audience, their eyes

1801
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:00,060
just rolled in the back of their head all the way to the

1802
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:07,170
back. But no, thank you, Lula.

1803
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:09,600
I appreciate it. I'm also

1804
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,600
a 34-year-old boomer, so

1805
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:18,689
he's unhinged.

1806
02:06:18,689 --> 02:06:20,930
Thank you. DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.

1807
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:22,930
Checking in from Gap Gaming again.

1808
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:24,930
Really great job with our testing.

1809
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:26,930
With testing our anti-ad gimmick

1810
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:28,930
last time. You really got your chat going.

1811
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:30,930
Any Gappers?

1812
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:32,930
That said, it is concerning to

1813
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,930
us that you can't seem to beat a game made

1814
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:36,930
for three-year-olds. We'll have to dock some points

1815
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:38,930
for that in your upcoming review.

1816
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,930
Hope you get better, you dumb

1817
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:42,930
idiot streamer.

1818
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:44,930
Thank you, Gapp.

1819
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:50,050
Appreciate it. No, that's

1820
02:06:50,050 --> 02:06:52,050
DarkSoul. That's DarkSoul9669.

1821
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,050
Your name's not Gapp.

1822
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:58,399
Max, a disaster

1823
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:00,399
thanks for the 500 bits.

1824
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:03,920
Alright, Jermit, just want to thank you for streaming today. My mother was

1825
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,920
just diagnosed with multiple

1826
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,920
myeloma.

1827
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,920
Myeloma? It's a blood

1828
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:11,920
plasma cancer that affects bones.

1829
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:13,920
So I'm glad I have your

1830
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,920
LUL moments to take my mind off things.

1831
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,920
Here's five bucks to show my appreciation

1832
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,920
for your Twitch funny man endeavors.

1833
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:22,609
Thanks.

1834
02:07:22,609 --> 02:07:24,609
I'm really, really sorry to hear that.

1835
02:07:24,609 --> 02:07:29,979
I don't know, I'm not sure what

1836
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:31,979
stage or what

1837
02:07:31,979 --> 02:07:35,380
how far along that is.

1838
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:37,380
But hopefully

1839
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:43,649
it's very treatable. You do what you

1840
02:07:43,649 --> 02:07:46,140
can, right? Thank you so much.

1841
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:48,140
I wish the absolute best

1842
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:58,380
for your mother. Glad to have

1843
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:04,909
you. Cancer sucks.

1844
02:08:04,909 --> 02:08:08,880
If I could seriously just go like this

1845
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,880
and get rid of it. Oh, I would do it a hundred times.

1846
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,880
Everybody would.

1847
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,880
Just one of those stupid fucking illnesses that

1848
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:17,180
we still can't

1849
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:21,470
seem to figure out, you know?

1850
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:30,560
But a lot of it is treatable. All the best

1851
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,560
to you and your mother.

1852
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:37,619
Thank you for the five dollars.

1853
02:08:37,619 --> 02:08:44,659
Shitty viewbot thanks for the 500 bits.

1854
02:08:44,659 --> 02:08:46,659
Not like this, not like this, not like this.

1855
02:08:46,659 --> 02:08:48,659
Drugs are bad. Was that when I was pretending

1856
02:08:48,659 --> 02:08:55,500
that I was on drugs?

1857
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,500
Oh, I mean, we can talk about this very

1858
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,500
briefly now if you want.

1859
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,500
I think I haven't talked about it

1860
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,500
really that much at all.

1861
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:06,260
But one of the reasons why

1862
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:08,260
the rumble has not been done

1863
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,819
yet is because

1864
02:09:10,819 --> 02:09:13,180
the next

1865
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:15,180
rumble is going to be

1866
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:17,420
a charity event.

1867
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:19,420
And all the money that that stream takes

1868
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:21,420
in, whether it's bits or

1869
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,420
subs, whatever money that that stream takes in

1870
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:25,420
that day,

1871
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:27,420
is going to go and sponsor

1872
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:29,420
a good friend of mine's

1873
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:31,420
Boston Marathon run.

1874
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:33,600
And all that money is going to

1875
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:35,600
go to a, I believe, a pediatric

1876
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,600
cancer ward in Boston.

1877
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:43,220
So we're trying to figure

1878
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:45,220
out maybe some fun things to do.

1879
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:51,170
But that's part of the plan.

1880
02:09:51,170 --> 02:10:00,319
Have him run in

1881
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:02,319
blue man attire. We've been

1882
02:10:02,319 --> 02:10:04,319
talking about ideas of

1883
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:06,500
essentially we're going to have

1884
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,500
him be a character in the rumble.

1885
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:10,500
And whatever he has in clothes,

1886
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,500
we're going to have him run in those clothes

1887
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:14,500
and I'm going to have him take some video.

1888
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,670
This should be fun.

1889
02:10:16,670 --> 02:10:21,729
He's going to be a new original

1890
02:10:21,729 --> 02:10:27,489
character. He's just like, yeah,

1891
02:10:27,489 --> 02:10:29,489
I'll do, that'll be fun. I just want to make

1892
02:10:29,489 --> 02:10:31,489
sure I can actually run in whatever it

1893
02:10:31,489 --> 02:10:33,489
is. And it's like, don't worry, I'll take care of you.

1894
02:10:33,489 --> 02:10:43,090
And the way that it's set up, it's actually

1895
02:10:43,090 --> 02:10:45,090
should be pretty easy because

1896
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:47,899
there's specific, there's

1897
02:10:47,899 --> 02:10:49,899
going to be a specific website that is linked

1898
02:10:49,899 --> 02:10:52,079
directly to the charity.

1899
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:54,079
So the money,

1900
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:56,079
I can, from everything that comes in in that stream,

1901
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:58,079
I can just put it directly in

1902
02:10:58,079 --> 02:11:00,079
to that website.

1903
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:04,500
So it's not like, oh, I'm going to

1904
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,500
just make all this money on Twitch and then

1905
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,500
then I'll figure it out later.

1906
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,500
No, it'll be, there'll be plenty of avenues

1907
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,500
to get that figured out.

1908
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:15,250
It'll be live action, it will not.

1909
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:21,250
But that's the plan.

1910
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:23,250
Because the marathon is in April.

1911
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:25,250
So I want to do it a little bit

1912
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:27,250
before that, obviously, to make sure

1913
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,250
because it's to essentially sponsor

1914
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:31,619
is run. Or at least to contribute

1915
02:11:31,619 --> 02:11:33,619
what I, in this

1916
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:35,619
community, can, right?

1917
02:11:35,619 --> 02:11:42,899
We'll see.

1918
02:11:42,899 --> 02:11:44,899
But thank you to Jim, Jim

1919
02:11:44,899 --> 02:11:46,899
Poe for the 300 bits.

1920
02:11:46,899 --> 02:11:49,520
Somewhere in January.

1921
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,520
When it's

1922
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,270
ready. It will be

1923
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:56,270
absolutely before March.

1924
02:11:56,270 --> 02:12:07,020
Let's just put it that way.

1925
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:09,840
Before March.

1926
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:11,840
But thank you Jim, thanks for the 300 bits.

1927
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,840
No message. Tar Alephren

1928
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,840
thanks for the 253.

1929
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,840
Jim's use of a guide in the stream invalidates

1930
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:19,840
all prior alleged accomplishments

1931
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,840
on stream. How can we be sure

1932
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,840
this guy didn't use a guide in all three

1933
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,840
Dark Souls and Sekiro?

1934
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,020
Um, here's

1935
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:31,020
your rebuttal here. I played

1936
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:33,020
Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro

1937
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:35,520
when they launched.

1938
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,520
I played Sekiro the day it came out.

1939
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,520
There's no guide. What guide existed on

1940
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,520
day zero? I played it when it

1941
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:46,189
came out.

1942
02:12:46,189 --> 02:12:48,189
One day had gone by and nobody even had

1943
02:12:48,189 --> 02:12:56,579
beaten the game. You don't have

1944
02:12:56,579 --> 02:13:00,539
any witnesses. Guides

1945
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:02,539
came out pre-release. You think I was flipping

1946
02:13:02,539 --> 02:13:04,539
through

1947
02:13:04,539 --> 02:13:06,539
the shit that they sell at GameStop?

1948
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:08,539
That's as big as an encyclopedia with the pictures?

1949
02:13:08,539 --> 02:13:20,130
All prior

1950
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:22,369
accomplishments.

1951
02:13:22,369 --> 02:13:24,369
Sorry I wanted to, uh,

1952
02:13:24,369 --> 02:13:26,369
keep

1953
02:13:26,369 --> 02:13:28,369
the Nancy Drew stream

1954
02:13:28,369 --> 02:13:30,369
on track.

1955
02:13:30,369 --> 02:13:32,609
All prior

1956
02:13:32,609 --> 02:13:34,609
accomplishments are null.

1957
02:13:34,609 --> 02:13:38,130
Oh, he's stuttering. He's stuttering.

1958
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:41,970
He's stuttering. Hey, little kitty,

1959
02:13:41,970 --> 02:13:43,970
thanks for the 500 bits. They say good job.

1960
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:46,529
Thank you. Hey, you did a good job

1961
02:13:46,529 --> 02:13:48,529
too, in whatever you did today.

1962
02:13:48,529 --> 02:13:55,680
Thank you. Influx meme,

1963
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,680
thanks for the 300 bits.

1964
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:00,300
Uh, this is a two-part message.

1965
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:03,380
This is the second part of my message.

1966
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:07,539
Oh, I see what you're saying here. Okay.

1967
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:09,539
Uh, just want to say your huge

1968
02:14:09,539 --> 02:14:11,539
influence you've had in my life as I

1969
02:14:11,539 --> 02:14:13,539
approach my twenties. Your videos and

1970
02:14:13,539 --> 02:14:15,539
streams have always brought me comfort whenever times

1971
02:14:15,539 --> 02:14:17,539
have been tough, and your unique brand of comedy has influenced

1972
02:14:17,539 --> 02:14:19,539
the stuff I like so much you have no idea.

1973
02:14:19,539 --> 02:14:21,779
I know you've probably heard this stuff

1974
02:14:21,779 --> 02:14:23,779
before, but you really have a huge impact on your viewers.

1975
02:14:23,779 --> 02:14:25,779
And I get to germ a heart

1976
02:14:25,779 --> 02:14:27,779
with this absolute chad of a man.

1977
02:14:27,779 --> 02:14:36,850
Uh,

1978
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:38,850
I really appreciate that. That's

1979
02:14:38,850 --> 02:14:41,340
there's a lot of nice things to say

1980
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:44,539
about somebody. And then you say

1981
02:14:44,539 --> 02:14:46,539
one of your early TF2 Q&A

1982
02:14:46,539 --> 02:14:48,539
videos you were initially going to delete your

1983
02:14:48,539 --> 02:14:50,539
channel, but a friend stopped you

1984
02:14:50,539 --> 02:14:52,539
and told you to just see where

1985
02:14:52,539 --> 02:14:54,539
it took you. Do you sometimes think about

1986
02:14:54,539 --> 02:14:56,539
that? What would have been had you not taken

1987
02:14:56,539 --> 02:14:58,539
that chance? You still

1988
02:14:58,539 --> 02:15:00,539
talk to that person who was at Burger Boy.

1989
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:02,539
I'm not sure of my path in life, so

1990
02:15:02,539 --> 02:15:04,539
you don't have any advice. I'm not sure of my path in life.

1991
02:15:04,539 --> 02:15:06,539
Do you have any advice for me? Thank you.

1992
02:15:06,539 --> 02:15:08,850
Mod that friend.

1993
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:11,659
Well, here's the thing.

1994
02:15:11,659 --> 02:15:16,460
Anytime you start something new,

1995
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:19,899
right, it doesn't matter what it is,

1996
02:15:19,899 --> 02:15:23,300
after you do it for the first

1997
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:25,600
time, and you

1998
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:27,600
go through with it, you have

1999
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,600
that first initial bump

2000
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:31,779
of, this is dumb,

2001
02:15:31,779 --> 02:15:33,779
this is, I probably shouldn't

2002
02:15:33,779 --> 02:15:35,779
have done this. This is like kind of dumb, right?

2003
02:15:35,779 --> 02:15:37,779
Like, I can

2004
02:15:37,779 --> 02:15:39,779
probably use my time somewhere else.

2005
02:15:39,779 --> 02:15:41,779
Uh, nah, yeah, I'll do something else.

2006
02:15:41,779 --> 02:15:44,210
That happened to me all the time.

2007
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:53,039
I'm in Vegas right now, I'm over

2008
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:56,880
21 this time. And if memory serves

2009
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,880
me correctly, it was a

2010
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:02,020
long time ago. I don't

2011
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:04,020
remember if it was Burger Boy or not.

2012
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:06,020
Maybe, I think it was somebody

2013
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:09,920
that I went to college with.

2014
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,920
Maybe it was, no, who was it?

2015
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,949
This is gonna fucking eat me up now.

2016
02:16:15,949 --> 02:16:17,949
Who said to like just, I

2017
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:19,949
said that I made a YouTube channel.

2018
02:16:19,949 --> 02:16:29,149
Like you went to college.

2019
02:16:29,149 --> 02:16:31,149
I did. I showed

2020
02:16:31,149 --> 02:16:33,149
my diploma on stream. Did you see it?

2021
02:16:33,149 --> 02:16:39,549
From Blockbuster. I don't remember

2022
02:16:39,549 --> 02:16:42,819
who it was. That'll probably

2023
02:16:42,819 --> 02:16:45,250
come to me, like later tonight or

2024
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:49,020
something. I don't think it was Burger Boy.

2025
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:51,020
But they watched, they watched the two or three

2026
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:53,020
videos that were there. Which by the way, I deleted

2027
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:55,020
and re-uploaded, I think, twice.

2028
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:57,200
For some reason.

2029
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,620
Cause once like three or four

2030
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:03,620
five views came in, I was like,

2031
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:05,620
what, uh, these videos suck, I have to redo

2032
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:07,620
them. Somebody watched them, I have to make it better.

2033
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:14,590
I'm pretty sure I deleted and re-uploaded

2034
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:17,600
the same three videos like twice.

2035
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:21,059
But, I was told,

2036
02:17:21,059 --> 02:17:23,059
who cares? Just

2037
02:17:23,059 --> 02:17:28,180
let them ride, it doesn't matter.

2038
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:30,180
I'm gonna have to fucking go searching for like

2039
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:34,399
who fucking said that? Who was that?

2040
02:17:34,399 --> 02:17:36,399
Maybe it was Burger Boy. Cause we were going to the gym

2041
02:17:36,399 --> 02:17:40,180
all the time. We, me and

2042
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:42,180
Burger Boy, believe it or not,

2043
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:44,180
were in the gym three, four

2044
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:46,180
plus days a week. Back then.

2045
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:48,540
And I think I just offhandedly maybe told

2046
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:51,870
them, yeah, I don't know. Just two

2047
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:56,860
chads going to the gym.

2048
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:58,860
But what would I have done if that was,

2049
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,860
I mean, I don't know. I don't know, I can't

2050
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:02,860
rewind the clock and

2051
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:06,059
do another life.

2052
02:18:06,059 --> 02:18:08,059
What probably would have happened is I would have gone into something,

2053
02:18:08,059 --> 02:18:10,059
I would have just continued doing the stuff that I

2054
02:18:10,059 --> 02:18:12,059
liked already.

2055
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:15,379
I was really into

2056
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:17,379
stuff with animals.

2057
02:18:17,379 --> 02:18:19,379
You know, like volunteering. I was

2058
02:18:19,379 --> 02:18:21,379
probably going to maybe go to like vet tech school.

2059
02:18:21,379 --> 02:18:23,379
I still ended up volunteering

2060
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:30,930
for a while. But yeah,

2061
02:18:30,930 --> 02:18:32,930
that's sometimes I think about what would I,

2062
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:34,930
what would happen if I had not made

2063
02:18:34,930 --> 02:18:38,379
half of those videos that I made in the

2064
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:40,379
first two months that I started

2065
02:18:40,379 --> 02:18:45,180
this channel. But what would

2066
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:47,180
have happened if my first

2067
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:49,180
TF2, the Uber

2068
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:51,360
update video, didn't get on

2069
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:53,360
the TF2 Reddit?

2070
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,360
Like what would have happened?

2071
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,360
Would I even be sitting

2072
02:18:57,360 --> 02:19:00,239
here right now doing this?

2073
02:19:00,239 --> 02:19:04,530
Probably not. Probably not.

2074
02:19:04,530 --> 02:19:09,780
You would go be an English teacher in Japan.

2075
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:12,139
I can barely speak English.

2076
02:19:12,139 --> 02:19:21,489
You think I can teach somebody how?

2077
02:19:21,489 --> 02:19:26,350
But any advice, don't

2078
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:33,069
get in your own way. Because what

2079
02:19:33,069 --> 02:19:35,069
you are describing is me

2080
02:19:35,069 --> 02:19:37,440
almost getting in my way

2081
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:39,440
to a point where I didn't do any of this stuff.

2082
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:41,620
Don't get in your own way.

2083
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:52,159
Got it. Now I'm worth over

2084
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:54,159
a billion dollars.

2085
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:58,700
I wish you luck though, Influx.

2086
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:02,459
Thanks for sticking around. Really

2087
02:20:02,459 --> 02:20:04,459
interesting thought, though. I haven't thought about

2088
02:20:04,459 --> 02:20:07,219
that in a long time. Tar Alecran

2089
02:20:07,219 --> 02:20:09,219
thanks for the 250. Jerm, have you played Heaven's Vault

2090
02:20:09,219 --> 02:20:14,340
on stream? It's made

2091
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:16,340
by the same crew that made Sorcerate. It's

2092
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:18,340
an amazing adventure game in its own right. God

2093
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:24,739
dammit, I'm going to like burp. Hold on.

2094
02:20:24,739 --> 02:20:27,739
Alright, we're good. I have not played Heaven's Vault?

2095
02:20:27,739 --> 02:20:29,739
I'll have to look into that

2096
02:20:29,739 --> 02:20:33,069
but ankle? I'll check it out.

2097
02:20:33,069 --> 02:20:35,700
For any weapon, thanks for the 250

2098
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:37,700
forodian. Hey Jerma, just wanted to toss

2099
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:39,700
some coin to my streamer,

2100
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:41,700
Jerma Bald.

2101
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,700
Hope you had a Merry Christmas. Hopefully I'll be able to catch you

2102
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,700
live on New Year's Eve.

2103
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:47,700
That stream will be starting probably around 6

2104
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:50,190
o'clock Pacific.

2105
02:20:50,190 --> 02:20:53,069
9 p.m. Eastern.

2106
02:20:53,069 --> 02:20:55,069
We'll catch the Eastern ball drop.

2107
02:20:55,069 --> 02:20:57,250
And if there's

2108
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:59,250
enough time, maybe we'll catch the Pacific one as well.

2109
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:04,479
Maybe.

2110
02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:06,479
I was not with

2111
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,719
Kim last

2112
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:11,659
year on New Year's.

2113
02:21:11,659 --> 02:21:13,659
So I think I might want to

2114
02:21:13,659 --> 02:21:15,659
kind of end it after the Eastern

2115
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:20,270
ball drop. Because

2116
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:22,270
last year I didn't spend New Year's with Kim.

2117
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:25,149
And

2118
02:21:25,149 --> 02:21:27,149
there's an opportunity too this year.

2119
02:21:27,149 --> 02:21:35,600
It'll be a solid

2120
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,030
probably. We'll at least

2121
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:46,540
get one or two of them.

2122
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,540
Jerma loves his Eastern time zone viewers.

2123
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:51,229
I mean I spent

2124
02:21:51,229 --> 02:21:53,229
my entire life on the Eastern time zone.

2125
02:21:53,229 --> 02:21:55,229
And everybody bases

2126
02:21:55,229 --> 02:21:57,229
pretty much everything on the Eastern time zone.

2127
02:21:57,229 --> 02:22:04,719
EST is

2128
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:06,719
so much

2129
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:09,340
media is

2130
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:11,340
dictated by what time it is Eastern.

2131
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:20,180
That being said, I do love

2132
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:22,180
PST though, because I gain 3 hours.

2133
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:24,610
I get 3 hours on

2134
02:22:24,610 --> 02:22:26,610
all of you. Right now it's 10 o'clock.

2135
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:29,870
It used to be 1 a.m.

2136
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:31,870
when I would turn the stream off back in

2137
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:33,870
Massachusetts. It's 10 o'clock.

2138
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:39,819
I can still get a pizza. But thank you

2139
02:22:39,819 --> 02:22:42,059
Frodeon.

2140
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:30,200
We'll see.

2141
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,200
Don't forget to vote for stuff yet.

2142
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:36,940
Subscribe for more, plus like if you did.

2143
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,940
Thank you, level 6.

2144
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:43,290
Hey Reaper, thanks for the 250.

2145
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:45,290
Hey Jerma, I was doing the survey for voting and went down

2146
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:47,290
memory road for this year.

2147
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:49,290
It's been a great year. When I got to the end

2148
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:51,290
I wished that I could choose more than one

2149
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:53,290
for best joke of the decade.

2150
02:23:53,290 --> 02:23:55,290
Keep up the good work and let's make

2151
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:57,290
this decade as great as the last one.

2152
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:59,290
Cheers to you and Happy New Year.

2153
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:05,540
Happy New Year to you as well.

2154
02:24:05,540 --> 02:24:07,540
Yeah, just stay tuned for that show

2155
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:10,680
on New Year's Eve.

2156
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,049
It was the hardest choice on the list.

2157
02:24:13,049 --> 02:24:15,049
There were a lot of nominations.

2158
02:24:15,049 --> 02:24:17,049
It was actually hard to remove

2159
02:24:17,049 --> 02:24:19,049
some because there was just so many

2160
02:24:19,049 --> 02:24:21,049
in every category.

2161
02:24:21,049 --> 02:24:24,569
At least 10 of those categories were

2162
02:24:24,569 --> 02:24:26,569
full with 25

2163
02:24:26,569 --> 02:24:28,569
plus nominations. It was just

2164
02:24:28,569 --> 02:24:31,959
so many.

2165
02:24:31,959 --> 02:24:34,139
I'm glad there wasn't enough time

2166
02:24:34,139 --> 02:24:36,139
this year for people to at least have

2167
02:24:36,139 --> 02:24:38,139
that week to kind of think about something

2168
02:24:38,139 --> 02:24:40,309
that was fun rather than two days.

2169
02:24:40,309 --> 02:24:42,620
Yeah, it's been a great year.

2170
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:44,620
A lot of stuff has changed for me

2171
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:46,620
this year. You know, moved across the

2172
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:49,299
country. Started to do the stuff

2173
02:24:49,299 --> 02:24:51,299
that I wanted to do many, many years

2174
02:24:51,299 --> 02:24:53,299
ago. Get into some more

2175
02:24:53,299 --> 02:24:55,299
high production, high

2176
02:24:55,299 --> 02:25:00,170
octave streams.

2177
02:25:00,170 --> 02:25:02,170
And I plan on just kind of keeping that

2178
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:04,170
going for as long as I can, right?

2179
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:10,250
Cheers to you. Thank you Reaper.

2180
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:13,450
Dr. Cad,

2181
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:15,620
thank you for the 500 bits.

2182
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,620
I need you to watch a video just a little

2183
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:19,620
bit. It's a music video, but I think you'll enjoy it.

2184
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:21,620
Music video. What do you mean?

2185
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:27,129
This video is 28 minutes long.

2186
02:25:27,129 --> 02:25:38,940
What the hell is this?

2187
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:40,940
What?

2188
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:44,940
What is going on?

2189
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:53,239
No, this is like scary.

2190
02:25:53,239 --> 02:26:05,190
30

2191
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:07,750
minutes long. I'm gonna get

2192
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:12,229
gnomed. I might. I feel like

2193
02:26:12,229 --> 02:26:15,690
I'm gonna skip.

2194
02:26:32,899 --> 02:26:35,340
It's a pretty good video.

2195
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:43,319
It's 30

2196
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:45,319
minutes of that. I don't want to watch that.

2197
02:26:45,319 --> 02:26:48,010
That's a long time to sit there and

2198
02:26:48,010 --> 02:26:55,239
watch that. Yeah, there's the link.

2199
02:26:55,239 --> 02:26:59,659
It's right there. It's just a little

2200
02:26:59,659 --> 02:27:01,659
bit. It's a music video.

2201
02:27:01,659 --> 02:27:07,930
Hey Flustered Flamingo, thanks

2202
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:09,930
for the 300 bits. Hey German, thanks for the laughs this decade.

2203
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:11,930
Quick question. If you owned the internet

2204
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:13,930
for one day, what would you change?

2205
02:27:13,930 --> 02:27:19,750
I would delete Twitter, Facebook,

2206
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:21,750
Instagram, Snapchat,

2207
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:25,379
TikTok.

2208
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:29,860
I would delete all social media.

2209
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,860
But not Twitch though, because that's cool. It's fun.

2210
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:34,040
I would delete all social media.

2211
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:39,159
No, even Twitch. Even Twitch.

2212
02:27:39,159 --> 02:27:41,159
And YouTube. Delete it all. Get rid of it.

2213
02:27:41,159 --> 02:27:48,139
There would be instant replacements.

2214
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:51,209
No, and I would have broadcasted on every

2215
02:27:51,209 --> 02:27:53,209
airway. Do I have control of the

2216
02:27:53,209 --> 02:27:59,100
airways? No, I don't. But even

2217
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:01,979
just,

2218
02:28:01,979 --> 02:28:03,979
they'd instantly get replaced.

2219
02:28:03,979 --> 02:28:06,149
But even just for one

2220
02:28:06,149 --> 02:28:09,799
day, if

2221
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:11,799
everybody didn't have to use

2222
02:28:11,799 --> 02:28:15,379
it, even for one day,

2223
02:28:15,379 --> 02:28:18,260
even for three days,

2224
02:28:18,260 --> 02:28:22,489
announce it on Twitter.

2225
02:28:22,489 --> 02:28:26,709
Hot boomer take.

2226
02:28:26,709 --> 02:28:30,360
That's a villain thing

2227
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:32,360
to do. Is that a villain thing

2228
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,360
to do though, really? Think about that.

2229
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:46,579
We will rebuild it.

2230
02:28:46,579 --> 02:28:54,709
Facebook and TikTok? No. The

2231
02:28:54,709 --> 02:28:57,020
rest, yes. You're a Sunday morning

2232
02:28:57,020 --> 02:29:00,340
cartoon villain.

2233
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:02,340
And then when Scooby-Doo

2234
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:04,899
and crew stop

2235
02:29:04,899 --> 02:29:07,270
texting each other, and

2236
02:29:07,270 --> 02:29:09,270
they go play tetherball, and

2237
02:29:09,270 --> 02:29:12,409
then they go, whoa!

2238
02:29:12,409 --> 02:29:14,409
Maniacal Martin sure was actually

2239
02:29:14,409 --> 02:29:17,219
right, wasn't he?

2240
02:29:17,219 --> 02:29:21,059
We enjoyed some time outside.

2241
02:29:21,059 --> 02:29:23,059
Should we go get him out of jail?

2242
02:29:23,059 --> 02:29:25,059
Nah, nah, let him rot.

2243
02:29:25,059 --> 02:29:37,780
Oh, okay.

2244
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:39,780
Boomer, hot boomer take.

2245
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:41,780
No, if I had control of the internet,

2246
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:45,430
no, okay, I wouldn't delete all social

2247
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:48,500
media. I would take it all over.

2248
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:50,500
And I would make one tweet and one

2249
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:52,500
post on Facebook, on Twitter,

2250
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:54,500
on Instagram, on TikTok. It would

2251
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:57,000
just be, I'm only

2252
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
writing this so people still don't think I'm

2253
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,069
at TwitchCon-Germa.

2254
02:30:02,069 --> 02:30:09,049
Right, going live

2255
02:30:09,049 --> 02:30:11,049
tonight. Here's the

2256
02:30:11,049 --> 02:30:13,479
link. And try to

2257
02:30:13,479 --> 02:30:15,479
break Ninja's record

2258
02:30:15,479 --> 02:30:17,479
for like concurrent people on

2259
02:30:17,479 --> 02:30:19,979
a stream.

2260
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:22,219
Everybody

2261
02:30:22,219 --> 02:30:24,219
come to this link and just be there.

2262
02:30:24,219 --> 02:30:26,219
So I can get like 700,000

2263
02:30:26,219 --> 02:30:28,219
concurrent viewers for 10 seconds.

2264
02:30:28,219 --> 02:30:35,639
By the way, do any musicians want to play

2265
02:30:35,639 --> 02:30:48,819
a video game? He'd still be

2266
02:30:48,819 --> 02:30:53,299
late. No, if I control the internet,

2267
02:30:53,299 --> 02:30:55,299
I don't know what the fuck I would do.

2268
02:30:55,299 --> 02:31:05,590
I'd get scared. No, but way

2269
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:07,590
better. Yeah, I would take over all

2270
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:09,590
social media. And what I would

2271
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:11,590
simply do, this is the perfect

2272
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:13,590
take on this whole scenario.

2273
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:16,469
All I would do, I wouldn't

2274
02:31:16,469 --> 02:31:18,469
delete them. I wouldn't get rid of them.

2275
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:20,469
I wouldn't take over and tweet something myself.

2276
02:31:20,469 --> 02:31:22,469
All social media platforms,

2277
02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:24,469
all text

2278
02:31:24,469 --> 02:31:26,469
would just be what happens when an

2279
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:28,469
orc tries to talk to a human in Warcraft.

2280
02:31:28,469 --> 02:31:37,930
Done. Good luck.

2281
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:45,670
You could be the only source of porn

2282
02:31:45,670 --> 02:31:51,299
on the planet. What are you

2283
02:31:51,299 --> 02:32:02,950
talking about?

2284
02:32:02,950 --> 02:32:04,950
Why would that be the thing I go to?

2285
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:13,639
Anyways.

2286
02:32:13,639 --> 02:32:15,639
Thank you Flustered Flamingo for the 300

2287
02:32:15,639 --> 02:32:18,139
bits. Appreciate it. Gnarly

2288
02:32:18,139 --> 02:32:20,139
thanks for 250. I know I said that I couldn't donate

2289
02:32:20,139 --> 02:32:22,139
for a while, but I will gladly go into debt

2290
02:32:22,139 --> 02:32:24,139
to tell you, don't go into debt.

2291
02:32:24,139 --> 02:32:26,139
Don't go into debt to give me money. Don't do

2292
02:32:26,139 --> 02:32:28,139
that. Number one. Number two.

2293
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:30,139
Let's see what you said.

2294
02:32:30,139 --> 02:32:32,139
Do not listen to the garbage that the Drew crew

2295
02:32:32,139 --> 02:32:34,139
spews.

2296
02:32:34,139 --> 02:32:36,139
She's not even a real detective. Nancy Drew, more like

2297
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:40,299
Nancy fuck you.

2298
02:32:40,299 --> 02:32:46,360
Damn. That's harsh.

2299
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:50,780
That's really harsh.

2300
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:54,040
That's a pretty hot take, yeah?

2301
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:56,040
Don't go into debt for giving me money.

2302
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:59,180
Ever. For any reason. Keep that.

2303
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:04,299
Bank it. But thank you for the

2304
02:33:04,299 --> 02:33:09,030
250 though. Drew Hater

2305
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:12,549
is out. Hey Shmoo,

2306
02:33:12,549 --> 02:33:14,549
thanks for the 500 bits. Thank you Shmoo.

2307
02:33:14,549 --> 02:33:16,549
I've been a viewer since your first Surgeon

2308
02:33:16,549 --> 02:33:18,549
Simulator 2013 video. They're coming out

2309
02:33:18,549 --> 02:33:20,549
with a new one too. You helped me recently

2310
02:33:20,549 --> 02:33:22,549
get through an isolating period in my life.

2311
02:33:22,549 --> 02:33:24,549
I have to think about your advice on

2312
02:33:24,549 --> 02:33:26,549
persistence when things don't happen immediately.

2313
02:33:26,549 --> 02:33:28,549
Also the fact that you've never shit in a public

2314
02:33:28,549 --> 02:33:30,549
bathroom. You've got a lot of dedication

2315
02:33:30,549 --> 02:33:33,940
and that's inspiring as hell.

2316
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:35,940
Yes, that is true.

2317
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:37,940
That is still true. I

2318
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:39,940
have never taken

2319
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:41,940
a shit in a public bathroom.

2320
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,940
It has never happened in my entire

2321
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:45,940
life. Not once.

2322
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:52,090
Never. That's not false.

2323
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:54,090
I wish I could prove that somehow.

2324
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:56,090
I've never taken a shit in a public bathroom.

2325
02:33:56,090 --> 02:34:01,530
That's fine. You don't have to believe me. I just

2326
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:06,780
know it's true. I know it's true.

2327
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,780
Someday you won't have a choice.

2328
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:12,940
That day has not happened yet.

2329
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:15,750
Now, I

2330
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:17,750
don't count

2331
02:34:17,750 --> 02:34:21,829
private

2332
02:34:21,829 --> 02:34:25,420
bathrooms. So

2333
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:27,420
yes, I have taken a shit in a private

2334
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:29,420
bathroom. One where it's one person

2335
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:31,420
you go and you can lock the door.

2336
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:35,559
Right? Like what

2337
02:34:35,559 --> 02:34:37,559
do you classify as like a public bathroom?

2338
02:34:37,559 --> 02:34:41,770
Changing the definition. That

2339
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:44,329
counts as a public bathroom. A

2340
02:34:44,329 --> 02:34:46,329
public space. Public private bathroom.

2341
02:34:46,329 --> 02:34:48,329
A private bathroom is

2342
02:34:48,329 --> 02:34:51,270
one not in your house.

2343
02:34:51,270 --> 02:34:55,879
More than one stall is a public bathroom.

2344
02:34:55,879 --> 02:34:58,120
Well, I guess a single

2345
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:00,120
toilet with a locked door is technically

2346
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:02,120
a bathroom for the public.

2347
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:04,870
But it is a private

2348
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:08,260
bathroom. It's a private bathroom

2349
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:17,100
in public. Yeah.

2350
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:19,100
No, it's not. It's a private bathroom

2351
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:22,680
in... No, that's perfect.

2352
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,680
If it's not in someone's house, it's a public bathroom.

2353
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:26,680
Yeah. Okay. So I've taken a shit in a public

2354
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:31,219
bathroom in a private setting.

2355
02:35:31,219 --> 02:35:33,979
Maybe once or twice. But I've

2356
02:35:33,979 --> 02:35:35,979
never taken a shit in a

2357
02:35:35,979 --> 02:35:40,139
multi-stall bathroom.

2358
02:35:40,139 --> 02:35:42,139
If literally anybody can walk in, it's public.

2359
02:35:42,139 --> 02:35:45,909
But I can lock the door. If I

2360
02:35:45,909 --> 02:35:47,909
go into a bathroom that's one

2361
02:35:47,909 --> 02:35:49,909
toilet, I can lock the door and

2362
02:35:49,909 --> 02:35:54,389
just exist and be alright.

2363
02:35:54,389 --> 02:35:56,760
So is that a public bathroom?

2364
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:59,770
If you can't walk in

2365
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:02,329
there, it's now my

2366
02:36:02,329 --> 02:36:17,750
temporary private bathroom.

2367
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:19,750
A real public bathroom has a toilet with

2368
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:21,750
encircling theater seats.

2369
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:24,700
Holy shit. Why did I read that?

2370
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:27,129
I never thought this much about the walls

2371
02:36:27,129 --> 02:36:29,129
I shit surrounded by.

2372
02:36:29,129 --> 02:36:36,420
Do you remember a public bathroom? It's public.

2373
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,690
If you lock yourself in a

2374
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:41,690
school gym, it's not a private space.

2375
02:36:41,690 --> 02:36:43,690
Yeah, but I'm not taking a shit.

2376
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:46,569
The school gym is not

2377
02:36:46,569 --> 02:36:48,569
supposed to be a private setting.

2378
02:36:48,569 --> 02:36:52,149
Pulling my pants down and going to the bathroom

2379
02:36:52,149 --> 02:36:54,149
is a private setting.

2380
02:36:54,149 --> 02:36:56,459
It's a private place.

2381
02:36:56,459 --> 02:36:58,629
I'm not going to go to the bathroom in the gym.

2382
02:36:58,629 --> 02:37:03,049
It's open to the public, so it is

2383
02:37:03,049 --> 02:37:05,049
public. Yes. It's a public bathroom, but

2384
02:37:05,049 --> 02:37:07,049
it's a private section of the public

2385
02:37:07,049 --> 02:37:11,780
All right. Listen.

2386
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:13,780
I've taken a shit in a public bathroom,

2387
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:15,780
but never a multi-stall public bathroom.

2388
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:21,030
There you go. Done. What's going on?

2389
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:24,229
All bathrooms are private.

2390
02:37:24,229 --> 02:37:26,229
We can't sit here and argue

2391
02:37:26,229 --> 02:37:28,229
semantics. I've been trying

2392
02:37:28,229 --> 02:37:30,229
to for the last, like, five minutes.

2393
02:37:30,229 --> 02:37:40,729
Then you shit in a public bathroom.

2394
02:37:40,729 --> 02:37:42,729
Your semantics are bad.

2395
02:37:42,729 --> 02:37:44,729
What about that person that said all bathrooms

2396
02:37:44,729 --> 02:37:47,219
are private? A bathroom

2397
02:37:47,219 --> 02:37:49,219
is a private place.

2398
02:37:49,219 --> 02:38:00,149
This is the best

2399
02:38:00,149 --> 02:38:02,780
comment of the night. Who the fuck

2400
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:06,680
cares? Yeah.

2401
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:08,680
That's true.

2402
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,680
That's right. Like, who the fuck cares?

2403
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:13,559
Who cares if I've never taken a shit in a

2404
02:38:13,559 --> 02:38:20,920
multi-stall public bathroom?

2405
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,920
You do. I do.

2406
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,920
Hey, ButtSquire, thanks for the 250.

2407
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,920
Seeing you react that way to germs on a

2408
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:28,920
Wiimote reminded me of something.

2409
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:35,190
What does it remind you of?

2410
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:37,190
This is a full video. I'm going to watch this

2411
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:43,020
full video. Have you peed your

2412
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:49,459
pants? Yes.

2413
02:38:49,459 --> 02:38:54,389
Probably at least a dozen times.

2414
02:38:54,389 --> 02:38:56,389
I've peed my pants.

2415
02:38:56,389 --> 02:39:03,420
Yes.

2416
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:05,420
I have peed my pants. Not in my

2417
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:07,420
adult life. Maybe when I was like

2418
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,780
nine, ten years old or something.

2419
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:18,600
Hey,

2420
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:20,600
very nice. Thanks for the 750.

2421
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:22,600
Germa, listen to this. Three months ago I visited a museum

2422
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:24,600
dedicated to Native American artifacts and memorabilia.

2423
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:27,670
I eventually came upon a dark and

2424
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:29,670
foreboding mask with crimson

2425
02:39:29,670 --> 02:39:31,670
feathers adorning it.

2426
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:33,670
When I stared into its hollow eyes, it had something like

2427
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:35,670
a spirit trip or a vision.

2428
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:37,670
I saw everyone I knew and loved become great

2429
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:39,670
bears, soaring eagles, and

2430
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:42,299
trampling buffalo.

2431
02:39:42,299 --> 02:39:44,299
Then I woke up on a bench in the museum

2432
02:39:44,299 --> 02:39:46,299
and said, Bobby, have you ever had anything like that happen to you?

2433
02:39:46,299 --> 02:39:48,299
Don't do drugs before you go to a museum.

2434
02:39:48,299 --> 02:39:55,079
That's probably the moral of that

2435
02:39:55,079 --> 02:40:02,180
story. Say no, don't do drugs.

2436
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:07,239
That was very well-written.

2437
02:40:07,239 --> 02:40:11,590
It was. You're right.

2438
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:14,469
Can we get back to the game?

2439
02:40:14,469 --> 02:40:17,030
Oh.

2440
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:19,030
New Basaurus,

2441
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:21,340
the stream is over.

2442
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:23,340
If you might be new,

2443
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:25,340
then that's fine. I don't think you are though.

2444
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:27,340
I think I've seen your name before.

2445
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:29,340
At the end of the stream we do all

2446
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:31,340
the donations that came in that

2447
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:33,340
have reached a certain threshold.

2448
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:35,340
We talk about stuff, we just chill out for

2449
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:37,340
like 30, 40 minutes.

2450
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:39,340
Sometimes less, sometimes more.

2451
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:44,260
Just play the game. The stream is over.

2452
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:46,819
This is the post stream wrap-up

2453
02:40:46,819 --> 02:40:48,819
hangout session.

2454
02:40:48,819 --> 02:40:57,659
It's been on this screen for six hours.

2455
02:40:57,659 --> 02:41:01,049
That would be bad.

2456
02:41:01,049 --> 02:41:03,049
Hey, Matty Eyes,

2457
02:41:03,049 --> 02:41:05,049
thanks for the 510

2458
02:41:05,049 --> 02:41:08,120
bits. Watching through the

2459
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:10,120
old clips while I was voting for New Year's Eve stream was so

2460
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:12,120
fun. Looking forward to plenty more fun times.

2461
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:14,120
Wishing everyone a fun and safe New Year's.

2462
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:16,120
Much love and may the New Year bring

2463
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:18,620
great things. Let's hope so.

2464
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:21,620
I hope so.

2465
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:24,870
Thank you.

2466
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:27,559
Snipers, thanks for the thousand bits.

2467
02:41:27,559 --> 02:41:29,559
Here are some bits for that pizza.

2468
02:41:29,559 --> 02:41:31,989
We'll be getting a nice thin crust

2469
02:41:31,989 --> 02:41:34,360
pepperoni pizza. Gonna just

2470
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:36,360
slowly enjoy it

2471
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:40,260
while I watch

2472
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:42,260
surprise eggs videos.

2473
02:41:42,260 --> 02:41:49,219
Oh, can't wait.

2474
02:41:49,219 --> 02:41:52,170
Thank you for the thousand bits.

2475
02:41:52,170 --> 02:41:54,170
Very nice again. Thanks for the

2476
02:41:54,170 --> 02:41:56,170
250 bits you made. Me buy 250

2477
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:58,170
more bits because you made so much sense

2478
02:41:58,170 --> 02:42:00,170
when you talked about the necessity of simplicity

2479
02:42:00,170 --> 02:42:02,170
in pizza. I was right there with

2480
02:42:02,170 --> 02:42:04,170
you. I felt you. I've been telling people that for about

2481
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:06,170
five years now, but no one listens to me.

2482
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:08,170
Maybe they'll listen to the greatest internet entertainer

2483
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:10,170
alive. German985.

2484
02:42:10,170 --> 02:42:16,309
Hey, if you like

2485
02:42:16,309 --> 02:42:18,309
whatever pizza you like, you like it.

2486
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:21,510
That's you donating to yourself.

2487
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:25,799
The rock.

2488
02:42:25,799 --> 02:42:42,100
Wrong pizza opinion.

2489
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:44,100
Pepperoni is greasy as fuck.

2490
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:50,309
I like pepperoni on pizza.

2491
02:42:50,309 --> 02:42:52,309
It adds like a nice delicious smoky

2492
02:42:52,309 --> 02:42:55,000
flavor. Especially when

2493
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,180
the pepperonis are

2494
02:42:57,180 --> 02:42:59,180
really crispy. When you bite into

2495
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:01,180
pepperoni, you get that pepperoni crunch

2496
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:03,180
that's almost like candy pepperoni.

2497
02:43:08,809 --> 02:43:10,979
It's the best.

2498
02:43:10,979 --> 02:43:15,590
It's the best. And then when you get

2499
02:43:15,590 --> 02:43:17,590
sometimes when pepperoni,

2500
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:19,590
not all pizza places do this, but

2501
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:21,590
some of them do. When you have

2502
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:23,590
pizza in the oven, right?

2503
02:43:23,590 --> 02:43:25,959
And there's pepperoni on it.

2504
02:43:25,959 --> 02:43:27,959
After a little while, the

2505
02:43:27,959 --> 02:43:29,959
little pepperoni discs

2506
02:43:29,959 --> 02:43:31,959
turn into these almost these little

2507
02:43:31,959 --> 02:43:35,670
bowls, right?

2508
02:43:35,670 --> 02:43:37,670
And inside the little cooked

2509
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:39,670
pepperoni bowls

2510
02:43:39,670 --> 02:43:41,670
is a few droplets

2511
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:43,670
of this delicious

2512
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:45,670
magical

2513
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:48,620
liquid.

2514
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:50,620
And then when you bite into it and you get

2515
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:52,620
the crunch of the little pepperoni bowl and

2516
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:54,620
the sauce and the little oil,

2517
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:58,899
it's called liquid fat.

2518
02:43:58,899 --> 02:44:00,899
Yeah. And that's good.

2519
02:44:00,899 --> 02:44:02,899
Just don't eat it every day.

2520
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:07,899
That's fucking heinous.

2521
02:44:07,899 --> 02:44:10,389
No, it's not. What?

2522
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:12,389
Do I like bacon crispy or soggy?

2523
02:44:12,389 --> 02:44:14,389
Crispy, crunchy, crispity,

2524
02:44:14,389 --> 02:44:16,389
crunchity. Don't give me any soggy

2525
02:44:16,389 --> 02:44:19,399
bacon. Gross.

2526
02:44:19,399 --> 02:44:32,520
Who likes soggy bacon?

2527
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:35,659
Yeah, I don't. I don't see

2528
02:44:35,659 --> 02:44:37,659
why would soggy bacon

2529
02:44:37,659 --> 02:44:39,659
I wouldn't want to eat soggy bacon.

2530
02:44:39,659 --> 02:44:46,250
Crunchy pepperoni bowls are the best food in the world

2531
02:44:46,250 --> 02:44:48,250
don't change my mind. I'm not trying to. I'm agreeing

2532
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:52,149
with you. Turkey bacon is also

2533
02:44:52,149 --> 02:44:54,780
awesome. That's true.

2534
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:56,780
Hey, gray blob thanks for the thousand bits. The only pizza

2535
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:58,780
topping is worth a damn are bacon and green pepper.

2536
02:44:58,780 --> 02:45:00,950
Bacon's alright in

2537
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:02,950
small doses. I don't like it all over

2538
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:04,950
the pizza, but if it's kind of

2539
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:06,950
put out there, crushed up

2540
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:12,389
gently. I don't like

2541
02:45:12,389 --> 02:45:15,139
green pepper on pizza. I like a simple

2542
02:45:15,139 --> 02:45:17,139
pizza. I like just cheese, pepperoni

2543
02:45:17,139 --> 02:45:20,149
like margarita style

2544
02:45:20,149 --> 02:45:22,520
pizzas. I like

2545
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:24,520
just simple. Simple, simple, simple.

2546
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:36,489
Gray blob thanks for the thousand bits.

2547
02:45:36,489 --> 02:45:38,659
Sucko,

2548
02:45:38,659 --> 02:45:40,659
sucko, me must

2549
02:45:40,659 --> 02:45:42,659
thanks for the 250. Hey, German, here's the protection

2550
02:45:42,659 --> 02:45:44,659
money. I know it's not the agreed amount, but please don't

2551
02:45:44,659 --> 02:45:47,219
kill me.

2552
02:45:47,219 --> 02:45:49,219
That's 250

2553
02:45:49,219 --> 02:45:51,219
bits. That's not

2554
02:45:51,219 --> 02:45:53,219
protection money. That's not protection

2555
02:45:53,219 --> 02:45:55,219
money. What are you talking about? I'm not

2556
02:45:55,219 --> 02:45:57,219
doing anything.

2557
02:45:57,219 --> 02:45:59,219
That's not enough.

2558
02:45:59,219 --> 02:46:01,219
I'm just saying

2559
02:46:01,219 --> 02:46:03,219
I'm just saying

2560
02:46:03,219 --> 02:46:05,219
250 is not like

2561
02:46:05,219 --> 02:46:07,219
that's not protection money.

2562
02:46:07,219 --> 02:46:09,530
That's alright.

2563
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:16,180
It's not.

2564
02:46:16,180 --> 02:46:18,180
If you walked up to me and said, hey, here's

2565
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:20,180
$2.50, man, it's my protection

2566
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:22,180
money. I'd be like, just fucking

2567
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:24,180
go buy yourself like a pack of gum.

2568
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:28,860
He's saying that. No, I'm

2569
02:46:28,860 --> 02:46:35,700
not saying that. Here's 250.

2570
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:37,700
Don't kill me. No,

2571
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:39,700
I'm not going to kill you over 250, dude.

2572
02:46:39,700 --> 02:46:42,579
That's not

2573
02:46:42,579 --> 02:46:44,579
what I'm saying. I'm not going to

2574
02:46:44,579 --> 02:46:46,579
$2.50, man.

2575
02:46:46,579 --> 02:46:48,579
I'm not going to die over

2576
02:46:48,579 --> 02:47:00,809
250.

2577
02:47:00,809 --> 02:47:09,129
Guys, there's no

2578
02:47:09,129 --> 02:47:11,129
crime movies that are ever made.

2579
02:47:11,129 --> 02:47:13,129
There's no mafia

2580
02:47:13,129 --> 02:47:15,129
movies that are ever made where the guy opens up a briefcase

2581
02:47:15,129 --> 02:47:17,129
and there's $2.50

2582
02:47:17,129 --> 02:47:19,129
in it for the big switch.

2583
02:47:19,129 --> 02:47:25,909
That would be a really shitty movie.

2584
02:47:43,239 --> 02:47:45,239
Do you take Bitcoin? I used to until nobody

2585
02:47:45,239 --> 02:47:48,379
did it. I used to have an Ethereum

2586
02:47:48,379 --> 02:47:50,379
address down in the description.

2587
02:47:50,379 --> 02:47:52,379
And over the course of seven

2588
02:47:52,379 --> 02:47:54,620
months, I think like

2589
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:56,620
$4 of Ethereum came in.

2590
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:59,750
I closed it. I'd never

2591
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:01,750
told me, but I was like, I'm out

2592
02:48:01,750 --> 02:48:03,750
of here. No one's using this.

2593
02:48:03,750 --> 02:48:10,729
How much is that $4

2594
02:48:10,729 --> 02:48:12,729
worth now?

2595
02:48:12,729 --> 02:48:17,530
Probably less.

2596
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:19,770
Probably a lot less.

2597
02:48:19,770 --> 02:48:21,770
Why are people spamming this video?

2598
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:23,770
No, I'm not. I'm getting enough

2599
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:37,780
pizza for God's sake.

2600
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:39,780
Post your ETH address and I'll give you $100.

2601
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:42,659
I don't even know what it is.

2602
02:48:42,659 --> 02:48:47,780
I don't even remember. Just

2603
02:48:47,780 --> 02:48:50,600
fuck my shit up.

2604
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,350
That video is old news?

2605
02:48:53,350 --> 02:48:55,350
Yeah, that video is circulated like

2606
02:48:55,350 --> 02:49:00,090
a year and a half ago.

2607
02:49:00,090 --> 02:49:02,090
For the life of me, I can't find the no emotion stream.

2608
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:08,170
I don't even know what it was. You know the

2609
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:10,540
address? Well, don't send $100

2610
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:12,540
to that address because I'm not even sure I can get into

2611
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:17,340
that account. It was HotLavaNGU.

2612
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,829
That's right.

2613
02:49:19,829 --> 02:49:22,969
That's true. Do you have an OnlyFans?

2614
02:49:22,969 --> 02:49:25,850
I don't know what that is.

2615
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:33,979
Anyways, we're almost at the

2616
02:49:33,979 --> 02:49:37,430
end.

2617
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:41,850
Gnarly thanks to the 250.

2618
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:43,850
Oh yeah, I had a dream on Christmas Eve where I woke up at 6am

2619
02:49:43,850 --> 02:49:45,850
on Christmas morning to you streaming.

2620
02:49:45,850 --> 02:49:47,850
You were being recorded by a camera behind you.

2621
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:49,850
You were playing League of Legends on a

2622
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:51,850
tiny laptop. Hope your Christmas

2623
02:49:51,850 --> 02:49:53,850
went better than dream

2624
02:49:53,850 --> 02:50:02,870
Jerma's.

2625
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:04,870
Alright, here comes the credits.

2626
02:50:04,870 --> 02:50:06,870
Here comes all the subs.

2627
02:50:06,870 --> 02:50:09,739
Thanks a lot guys.

2628
02:50:09,739 --> 02:50:11,739
See you tomorrow for No More Heroes. I'm going to get it to work somehow.

2629
02:50:11,739 --> 02:50:13,739
I will. I will figure it out.

2630
02:50:13,739 --> 02:50:15,739
Even if we have to play it on original hardware, I will.

2631
02:50:15,739 --> 02:50:28,389
We'll figure it out.

2632
02:50:28,389 --> 02:50:30,389
You didn't say it was better? Jerma had a bad...

2633
02:50:30,389 --> 02:50:32,389
No, my Christmas was fine. My Christmas is good.

2634
02:50:32,389 --> 02:50:34,700
I had a relaxing Christmas.

2635
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:39,610
It was nice.

2636
02:50:39,610 --> 02:50:42,229
But, that's a weird dream.

2637
02:50:42,229 --> 02:50:44,229
Why would it be on a tiny laptop? You can't play games on a tiny laptop

2638
02:50:44,229 --> 02:50:46,229
unless it's

2639
02:50:46,229 --> 02:50:48,729
Candy Crush.

2640
02:50:48,729 --> 02:50:50,729
Why would you play Candy Crush in the first place?

2641
02:50:50,729 --> 02:50:55,590
There are only two places where you

2642
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:57,959
play Candy Crush.

2643
02:50:57,959 --> 02:50:59,959
And one is

2644
02:50:59,959 --> 02:51:01,959
in the airplane

2645
02:51:01,959 --> 02:51:03,959
because it's on one of those

2646
02:51:03,959 --> 02:51:05,959
weird devices that has weird games on it.

2647
02:51:05,959 --> 02:51:07,959
Or sitting at the one...

2648
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:14,170
Like sitting at Chili's.

2649
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:16,170
Because it's on that little kiosk thing that's on the tables.

2650
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:19,559
Otherwise there's no reason to play that game.

2651
02:51:19,559 --> 02:51:28,840
Should I do it? No.

2652
02:51:28,840 --> 02:51:30,840
Yeah, I'll do a Candy Crush stream.

2653
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,840
No, I won't. Lie. Yes, I will.

2654
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:38,920
What are my thoughts on acne videos?

2655
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:40,920
I don't... What do you mean acne videos?

2656
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,920
Videos about people's acne or videos about people

2657
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:45,860
popping pimples?

2658
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:47,860
Which, both of those, I'm going to say

2659
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:49,860
I don't think I want to watch them.

2660
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:55,110
Hey, Lula!

2661
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:57,110
Lula, thanks for another 500 bits here.

2662
02:51:57,110 --> 02:51:59,110
My son is 10, but he's aware of

2663
02:51:59,110 --> 02:52:01,110
entertainment versus reality, so swears

2664
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:03,110
aren't a big deal in our house.

2665
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:05,110
He knows I'd kick his ass if he talked like you.

2666
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:07,110
Oh my god!

2667
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:09,110
But he's allowed to enjoy the show.

2668
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:11,110
Believe it or not, your content is pretty wholesome, really.

2669
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:25,700
If you think so.

2670
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:30,889
As much as we fuck around,

2671
02:52:30,889 --> 02:52:33,190
I do try to just have...

2672
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:35,190
I try to stay... I try to have fun.

2673
02:52:35,190 --> 02:52:37,370
I don't ever want it to be

2674
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:39,370
like a downer stream.

2675
02:52:39,370 --> 02:52:41,370
I know sometimes I can

2676
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:43,370
fly off the handle, and then I can have

2677
02:52:43,370 --> 02:52:45,610
little episodes.

2678
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:48,229
But for the most part, I like to just

2679
02:52:48,229 --> 02:52:50,409
have fun. And I don't want to

2680
02:52:50,409 --> 02:52:52,409
have fun in

2681
02:52:52,409 --> 02:52:54,409
mean, bad

2682
02:52:54,409 --> 02:52:57,350
ways, I guess.

2683
02:52:57,350 --> 02:52:59,350
Unless it's, you know, we're joking around with

2684
02:52:59,350 --> 02:53:05,110
channel stuff.

2685
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:07,110
Let's put it this way, I never want anyone to feel

2686
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:09,110
bad when they watch this stream.

2687
02:53:09,110 --> 02:53:12,250
Like, truly be like,

2688
02:53:12,250 --> 02:53:14,250
oh, I feel like shit watching this stream.

2689
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:16,250
I don't like this. I don't...

2690
02:53:16,250 --> 02:53:18,250
I feel awful.

2691
02:53:18,250 --> 02:53:20,250
I don't want you to feel bad.

2692
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:23,059
That's completely against why I

2693
02:53:23,059 --> 02:53:30,040
wanted to have fun.

2694
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:33,500
You killed God, though.

2695
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:35,500
Yeah, and like, that was a lot of fun.

2696
02:53:42,659 --> 02:53:47,139
You're a psycho.

2697
02:53:47,139 --> 02:53:52,780
I'm not... Look. Fine.

2698
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:54,780
You can have your...

2699
02:53:54,780 --> 02:53:57,659
You can have your little... You can have your fun.

2700
02:53:57,659 --> 02:53:59,659
I'm not gonna clip that. That's fucked up.

2701
02:53:59,659 --> 02:54:03,500
What, are you guys trying to protect me now?

2702
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:07,209
Should I be paying you protection money?

2703
02:54:07,209 --> 02:54:14,500
Alright, we're almost done. We're at the end.

2704
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:17,579
We have...

2705
02:54:17,579 --> 02:54:19,579
But seriously, thanks for the subs, everybody.

2706
02:54:19,579 --> 02:54:23,930
There's a ton of you now.

2707
02:54:23,930 --> 02:54:26,299
Thanks for letting me continue to do this.

2708
02:54:26,299 --> 02:54:30,139
All of you. But thank you, Lula,

2709
02:54:30,139 --> 02:54:32,139
for the 500 bits. Thank you, Space Marine,

2710
02:54:32,139 --> 02:54:34,139
for the 1500 bits.

2711
02:54:34,139 --> 02:54:36,139
I just got out of my most difficult semester

2712
02:54:36,139 --> 02:54:38,139
that I've ever had in schooling.

2713
02:54:38,139 --> 02:54:40,139
I'm a chemical engineer junior

2714
02:54:40,139 --> 02:54:42,139
at a private university, so we've got a fucking

2715
02:54:42,139 --> 02:54:46,299
real smart one here.

2716
02:54:46,299 --> 02:54:48,299
We bring this up, but seriously,

2717
02:54:48,299 --> 02:54:50,299
chemical engineers in chat,

2718
02:54:50,299 --> 02:54:52,299
doctors,

2719
02:54:52,299 --> 02:54:54,299
lawyers, dentists.

2720
02:54:54,299 --> 02:55:00,950
This past semester has crushed me

2721
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:03,260
academically, socially,

2722
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:05,260
mentally.

2723
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:07,260
You're one of the few people that can always make me smile and laugh

2724
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:09,260
even when I have been beaten down.

2725
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:11,260
I wanted to give back even a small amount

2726
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:13,260
for the great things you've done for my happiness.

2727
02:55:13,260 --> 02:55:15,260
Thank you for being you. Turbo Heart.

2728
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:24,139
Thanks a lot.

2729
02:55:24,139 --> 02:55:26,569
Hopefully your...

2730
02:55:26,569 --> 02:55:28,569
The hardest part of your schooling

2731
02:55:28,569 --> 02:55:30,870
is over.

2732
02:55:30,870 --> 02:55:32,870
And you can relax a little bit and it won't be as

2733
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:34,870
bad the next time or when you graduate,

2734
02:55:34,870 --> 02:55:36,870
obviously, when you're getting close.

2735
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:40,840
Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.

2736
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:45,639
I wish you luck on your journey

2737
02:55:45,639 --> 02:55:47,639
of becoming a chemical engineer.

2738
02:55:47,639 --> 02:55:51,930
Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around.

2739
02:55:51,930 --> 02:55:56,600
Don't push yourself too hard.

2740
02:55:56,600 --> 02:56:03,510
Try...

2741
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:05,510
Trump...Chump...

2742
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:07,510
T...Trump...

2743
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:09,750
Chump TTV.

2744
02:56:09,750 --> 02:56:12,950
Here we go.

2745
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:15,260
Thanks for the 400 bits.

2746
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:17,260
I work as a movie theater usher and have to clean up the movie theaters.

2747
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:19,260
Every time you end the stream,

2748
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:21,260
it reminds me of my job. So dirty.

2749
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:23,260
Love the streams, big guy.

2750
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:27,030
Thank you, Chump.

2751
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:29,030
And maybe if some of you guys would pick up after yourselves

2752
02:56:29,030 --> 02:56:31,030
at throwing shit, dumping drinks on the ground.

2753
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:36,280
Come on.

2754
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:41,780
The Jerem Plexus Theater has been open

2755
02:56:41,780 --> 02:56:43,780
since 1981.

2756
02:56:43,780 --> 02:56:46,020
Okay?

2757
02:56:46,020 --> 02:56:48,020
I know that when you're walking it makes

2758
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:50,200
that horrible sound.

2759
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:56,440
But

2760
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:58,440
that's because people are just throwing shit on the ground

2761
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:00,440
and they're being disgusting.

2762
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:10,040
When I go to the movies, I buy two drinks

2763
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:12,040
and just dump one on the floor.

2764
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:14,040
That's kind of what it feels like sometimes

2765
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:17,239
in some of these theaters.

2766
02:57:17,239 --> 02:57:19,239
That people are just buying extra popcorn

2767
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:24,040
so they can just dump it on the ground.

2768
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:26,040
It's like somebody goes into the movie theater

2769
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:28,040
and they buy a bunch of those...

2770
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:30,040
They buy like

2771
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:32,040
two boxes of dots

2772
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:35,100
and a lighter

2773
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:37,100
and they just slowly melt down

2774
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:39,399
all the dots in the

2775
02:57:39,399 --> 02:57:41,399
container.

2776
02:57:41,399 --> 02:57:43,399
They just slide out and smear the dot

2777
02:57:43,399 --> 02:57:45,399
candy sludge shit all over

2778
02:57:45,399 --> 02:57:47,399
the ground.

2779
02:57:47,399 --> 02:57:56,489
And all over the seats.

2780
02:57:56,489 --> 02:58:06,149
How does a floor even get like that?

2781
02:58:06,149 --> 02:58:08,149
What am I talking about? I'm talking about every movie theater.

2782
02:58:08,149 --> 02:58:10,149
That's not even true.

2783
02:58:10,149 --> 02:58:12,149
Movie theaters nowadays, a lot of them are

2784
02:58:12,149 --> 02:58:14,329
really nice.

2785
02:58:14,329 --> 02:58:17,530
Reclining chairs.

2786
02:58:17,530 --> 02:58:19,530
Room service.

2787
02:58:19,530 --> 02:58:21,700
Have you heard about this?

2788
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:23,700
You can get room service to your chair

2789
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:25,700
in some theaters now. You press a button

2790
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:27,700
and a flight attendant comes down and is like,

2791
02:58:27,700 --> 02:58:29,700
Oh, what do you want? I'll take the

2792
02:58:29,700 --> 02:58:34,379
ham and cheese and...

2793
02:58:34,379 --> 02:58:41,799
That's crazy.

2794
02:58:41,799 --> 02:58:45,129
That's $15 a ticket.

2795
02:58:45,129 --> 02:58:47,129
Here's the thing. I don't think I'd want to do that.

2796
02:58:47,129 --> 02:58:49,500
Imagine ordering a

2797
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:51,500
full dinner at a movie. You're like

2798
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:53,500
watching the movie. Your ticket bites out of like

2799
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:55,500
an avocado BLT

2800
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:57,500
melt turkey sandwich and like it's

2801
02:58:57,500 --> 02:58:59,500
getting all over you and you like wipe it with fucking napkins

2802
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:01,500
and what happened on the screen?

2803
02:59:01,500 --> 02:59:03,739
Like you're eating like a full spaghetti

2804
02:59:03,739 --> 02:59:05,739
and you're like, Oh, hold on. I'm like eating

2805
02:59:05,739 --> 02:59:07,739
a full dinner and it's dark.

2806
02:59:07,739 --> 02:59:13,750
It's pitch black in there.

2807
02:59:13,750 --> 02:59:15,750
They have little tables. Yeah, but I don't want to eat in the dark.

2808
02:59:15,750 --> 02:59:20,809
There are some things you can eat in the dark.

2809
02:59:20,809 --> 02:59:22,809
Popcorn, pretzel bites,

2810
02:59:22,809 --> 02:59:25,750
corn chips,

2811
02:59:25,750 --> 02:59:28,700
and those little hot dog bites.

2812
02:59:28,700 --> 02:59:33,049
Get a whole lobster.

2813
02:59:33,049 --> 02:59:38,360
Alright, let's get out of here.

2814
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:41,750
Al Store, H2O, thanks for the 250.

2815
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:43,750
Speaking of you in college, you've been approached by your college

2816
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:45,750
to come speak to students.

2817
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:47,750
No.

2818
02:59:47,750 --> 02:59:51,209
No, not even close.

2819
02:59:53,959 --> 02:59:55,959
Hey guys, welcome to the graduating

2820
02:59:55,959 --> 02:59:57,959
class of

2821
02:59:57,959 --> 02:59:59,959
2024.

2822
02:59:59,959 --> 03:00:02,780
And the man given the speech today to

2823
03:00:02,780 --> 03:00:04,780
congratulate you all is one of our

2824
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:07,209
alma mater. You might have

2825
03:00:07,209 --> 03:00:09,209
absolutely no fucking idea who this guy is.

2826
03:00:09,209 --> 03:00:11,209
He got popular by playing

2827
03:00:11,209 --> 03:00:13,209
Team Fortress 2 and saying the word

2828
03:00:13,209 --> 03:00:15,209
Shpee over and over again.

2829
03:00:15,209 --> 03:00:17,209
And by getting his ass kicked

2830
03:00:17,209 --> 03:00:19,209
by one of his close friends

2831
03:00:19,209 --> 03:00:21,209
who would get him to a point where he'd get

2832
03:00:21,209 --> 03:00:23,209
so angry that he would start screaming the F word

2833
03:00:23,209 --> 03:00:27,750
and he was recorded

2834
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:29,750
without his knowledge and uploaded to

2835
03:00:29,750 --> 03:00:31,750
YouTube. Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, that's where he got his

2836
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:33,750
star, German985. And like three

2837
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:35,750
people in the audience would be like

2838
03:00:35,750 --> 03:00:43,819
and I'd have a wicked red face.

2839
03:00:43,819 --> 03:00:45,819
Hey, everybody.

2840
03:00:47,819 --> 03:00:49,819
Oh, I don't feel so good.

2841
03:00:49,819 --> 03:00:51,819
I'm nervous. Hey, everybody.

2842
03:00:51,819 --> 03:00:53,819
Keep asking.

2843
03:00:53,819 --> 03:00:55,819
It's cool. Keep at it, everybody.

2844
03:00:55,819 --> 03:00:57,819
We're going to get out of here.

2845
03:00:57,819 --> 03:01:15,860
Congratulations, everybody.

2846
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:21,370
Fuchs? No. No, to answer your

2847
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:23,370
question, nobody knows who the fuck I am.

2848
03:01:23,370 --> 03:01:25,540
Outside of, you know,

2849
03:01:25,540 --> 03:01:28,680
this space. I don't think there's

2850
03:01:28,680 --> 03:01:30,680
very many people there. You also mentioned

2851
03:01:33,299 --> 03:01:35,299
granted my own college hasn't asked Logan

2852
03:01:35,299 --> 03:01:37,299
Paul to come speak, but I can see colleges

2853
03:01:37,299 --> 03:01:39,299
thinking it's something students would be interested in.

2854
03:01:39,299 --> 03:01:46,340
Would they?

2855
03:01:46,340 --> 03:01:48,649
No, you want somebody at your college

2856
03:01:48,649 --> 03:01:50,649
speech to be somebody that can

2857
03:01:50,649 --> 03:01:52,950
tell you, you need like a

2858
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:54,950
president or something.

2859
03:01:54,950 --> 03:01:56,950
Like a senator.

2860
03:01:56,950 --> 03:01:59,579
I can't make that speech.

2861
03:01:59,579 --> 03:02:04,500
I came back to the stream to hear that.

2862
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:11,399
I'm sorry. How bad

2863
03:02:11,399 --> 03:02:14,540
was that? Was that bad?

2864
03:02:14,540 --> 03:02:24,010
It wasn't that bad, was it?

2865
03:02:24,010 --> 03:02:26,010
Sorry. What do you mean sorry?

2866
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:28,440
It was pretty bad?

2867
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:32,409
Thank you to

2868
03:02:32,409 --> 03:02:34,409
Cheezance for the

2869
03:02:34,409 --> 03:02:36,409
400 bits. 2019 was a bad year

2870
03:02:36,409 --> 03:02:38,409
for me, but your laugh brings me life. Thanks.

2871
03:02:38,409 --> 03:02:40,409
Gotta go. My goddamn

2872
03:02:40,409 --> 03:02:43,100
cat just puked. I'm sorry

2873
03:02:43,100 --> 03:02:45,100
to hear that. Hopefully your cat's alright.

2874
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:50,790
What size shoe are you? 14.

2875
03:02:50,790 --> 03:02:57,819
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a fantastic

2876
03:02:57,819 --> 03:02:59,819
rest of your night. Thanks for sticking around

2877
03:02:59,819 --> 03:03:01,819
for the end of the Nancy Drew

2878
03:03:01,819 --> 03:03:03,819
the Sea of Mystery.

2879
03:03:03,819 --> 03:03:05,819
Make sure you vote.

2880
03:03:05,819 --> 03:03:07,819
You only have three days to do so.

2881
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:09,819
You have until

2882
03:03:09,819 --> 03:03:12,120
you have until 12pm

2883
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:14,120
Pacific time

2884
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:17,510
on the 31st.

2885
03:03:17,510 --> 03:03:19,510
That's when the poll is no longer going to be accepting

2886
03:03:19,510 --> 03:03:25,590
any votes.

2887
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:27,590
I'll be talking about this for the next three days straight.

2888
03:03:27,590 --> 03:03:30,540
I will make a...what are you voting

2889
03:03:30,540 --> 03:03:32,540
for? The worst stuff this

2890
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:34,540
channel's done in the whole year and some of the best

2891
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:37,479
stuff the channel's done over the year.

2892
03:03:37,479 --> 03:03:39,479
There are a lot of categories.

2893
03:03:39,479 --> 03:03:41,979
I actually...we got best

2894
03:03:41,979 --> 03:03:43,979
auto appearances on there too.

2895
03:03:43,979 --> 03:03:45,979
And yes, if you were curious, I

2896
03:03:45,979 --> 03:03:47,979
think it was just every time auto

2897
03:03:47,979 --> 03:03:49,979
appeared on the stream in

2898
03:03:49,979 --> 03:03:57,530
2019.

2899
03:03:57,530 --> 03:03:59,530
Have a wonderful rest of your night. See you guys tomorrow.

2900
03:03:59,530 --> 03:04:48,739
Take care guys.
