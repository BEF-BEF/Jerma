1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,029
I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. I'm here. I made it. I just had to pee. I was here.

2
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:23,219
I just peed. You didn't. I did. I don't know, those have been making me real irritated lately.

3
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:28,660
Like just today. Only today. Usually I like, I like don't give a shit at all about that. And it's

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,149
like, okay, it's funny. It's the rumor that that person has driven by here like 12 times in the

5
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:40,759
last like six minutes. And after 10 is when you start to be like, all right, like, can

6
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:47,820
can you just get to where you're going? It's what is your destination at this point?

7
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,460
It's at this point, I'm convinced that you're on an AI path. And like, what do I need to go out there

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:10,280
and like activate the cutscene or something? So am I missing my cue? Anyway, yes, yes, yes.

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:20,790
Anyways, today we are going to do something that I've been talking about for a while.

10
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:34,790
We're going to do the community activities. Dot to dots. Spot the differences. Where's Waldo?

11
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:46,500
Except it's me. Funny stories that the community has written. And then so, right. Now I have a lot

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:57,829
of these. There are, I believe, 45 dot to dot activities. I think there are 10. Where's Waldo's?

13
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:04,099
I think there are 10 spot the difference activities. And there are about two to three

14
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:10,060
hundred stories and jokes. So I don't think we're going to be able to get through all of those

15
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:22,550
today because I have to, I have to get on an airplane. This is the last stream you're going

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:31,699
to see from me until the carnival. This is going to be just a chill, relaxing, hey everybody, let's

17
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:40,629
let's just chill like yesterday. This is the last time you're going to see me until it turns on

18
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,909
and you're at the carnival. So without further ado, let me make sure I look okay.

19
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:05,699
Is he saying goodbye? I'm saying goodbye for like four days. It's not really not even that big of a

20
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:12,629
deal considering, like guys, I've taken, I've taken like four or five days off in a row

21
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:18,069
just like randomly before. So I'm acting like, oh it's the last time you're going to see me in four

22
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:31,960
days. I took like a full week off like two months ago. What am I talking about? It's all good.

23
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,830
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce to you

24
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,460
first segment of our stream this afternoon. Let me, let me actually get on camera for the first

25
00:03:43,460 --> 00:04:04,360
time in a long time and I actually like took a shower today. So, hey, he looks fresh. Oh,

26
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:15,530
wait, wait, wait. I should get a haircut pretty recently. So let's get a greasy forehead. I have

27
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,589
oily combination skin. So good. Yeah. You and my doctor have something in common. You both know

28
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:34,629
that. Great. Cool. Oh, it's, it's Otto. Everybody. Okay. Let me tell you something. Everybody that

29
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:43,610
has a dog. If you do not over the course of your life, get a mug with your dog on it. I mean,

30
00:04:43,610 --> 00:05:03,019
are you, are you really like a true dog owner? I'm not sure. Look at this shit. This is the first

31
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:10,730
one we're going to do. There are a lot of these. So if you don't know how a dot to dot works,

32
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:19,189
what could this be? Yeah, I know. A dot to dot is you have to start at one with your finger on the,

33
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,750
with the pencil, right? And you got to go, for instance, I'm not going to be zoomed in for these

34
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,019
because that's cheating. So you go one, two to three to four to five. You guys know how to do

35
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:35,879
this. It's very self-explanatory. I've got a, I've got an application here that is a really,

36
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,560
really neat thing. I can draw all over the screen. I can draw whatever I want. See what I mean?

37
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,750
And this is not on my computer. This is, this is a virtual machine. This is a virtual painting

38
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:55,060
machine. I can, I can, I can clear it. I can save it. It's pretty good technology.

39
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,730
I fucked it up. No, I just told you that I have a virtual painting technology thing.

40
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:13,180
I could go like this. He ruined it. You went, what'd you say? Microsoft paint? No,

41
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,350
this isn't Microsoft paint. I don't remember what this application is called, but it's actually,

42
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:26,709
yes, I do. I only know what this thing is called because of it has this name. I believe this

43
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:36,120
application is called Epic Pen. I think that is, that's actually what this is called. All right,

44
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,360
so let's get started. I think many people have trickled in now. People know this is going on.

45
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:50,649
It's a smart board. No, it's an Epic Pen. So let's go with the pencil and we already know

46
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:56,490
what this one is. I mean, come on, give me a break. See, I'm going to fuck these up.

47
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:05,750
That's be aware of that. I will screw at least half of these up. A little down here. One, two,

48
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:17,740
three, four, five, six, seven. Ooh, it's getting tricky down here. Here comes a jump scare.

49
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:36,740
Okay. Seven, eight, nine, 10. I got colors here. I can change colors. What color is,

50
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,800
wait, I have to change. What color is fireman's face? Fire. Oh, it's yellow. I fucked it all up

51
00:07:41,800 --> 00:08:00,300
already. Clear it. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Whoa, it's getting weird.

52
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:10,550
It's going in a circle. 22, 23. Don't go that way. Don't go that way. 24, 25, 20. Whoa, whoa,

53
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:27,449
is it a trick? No, it's not a trick. This is the fire. This is the fire. Right. Okay. This is the

54
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:37,240
fire. That was, that was cool. All right. Cool. Nice work. Six, seven, 28, 29, 30.

55
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:51,259
And we go up where it gives the flame. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. All the way up here. Here. This is

56
00:08:51,259 --> 00:09:12,980
pretty good. Two, and wrap it across to 53. First one is done. Look at how happy he looks.

57
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:23,590
Very, very good. That one was easy. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. Oh, let me tell you.

58
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,870
Jerma starts at half of his sentences, but let me tell you. Let me tell you something. Let me tell

59
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,549
you. Somebody, some of you guys decided to, I guess, be funny. And there were a bunch of

60
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,940
these in here that were just like triangles, just like one, two, three, and like a square.

61
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,929
Like that, that ain't, that ain't going to show up on stream. That's it. There's the first one.

62
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:56,419
That's fireman. While I do this, I'm going to put on some stories. Just, I want to, we've got to

63
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:01,620
get the first one done. I got to show you how it works. So I'm going to put on some stories now.

64
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:12,659
These are the stories that people have written. And yes, when I say I'm putting on the stories,

65
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,059
I'm literally, I'm literally going to have text to speech save them too,

66
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:32,820
because I've got to concentrate on this shit. Here we go. I was walking down the street the other day

67
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,139
and noticed something weird on the sidewalk. Something weird on the side. It looked like

68
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,740
nothing I had ever seen before. As I got closer, I could feel something emitting from it.

69
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:49,379
I grabbed the handle and pulled as hard as I could and a burnt crisp of a man fell out.

70
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:56,139
Thank you. Good lady. He said, I have been locked inside that walk in oven for days.

71
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,620
He then face planted so hard that he turned to dust and disappeared.

72
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,129
Okay. I got to pay attention. I haven't seen him since. Elizabeth L from Stockholm, Sweden,

73
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:12,330
closing square bracket. I saw German at a grocery store in Boston yesterday.

74
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,330
I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him

75
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,090
and ask him for photos or anything. Oh, he said, oh, like you're doing now. Right.

76
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,019
Closing square bracket. Back when army of two first came out, me and my college roommates,

77
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:37,139
sweetmates were all way too into halo three to really care. I didn't even think army of two was

78
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:45,049
on my radar in 2008. My college sweetmates would sneak into my room while I wasn't there and play

79
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:51,450
halo three without my permission on my Xbox. But more importantly, they would look at my DVD

80
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,919
collection. I had like 215 DVDs in alphabetical order and they would pay thanks for the five

81
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,519
dollars where they would move to random titles in different places and see how long it would take

82
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:11,340
me to notice. Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me than it does about them, but I could tell

83
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,639
every time that was the joke. I would just scan briefly over my DVDs every day and see if they

84
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,840
had taken one was usually the issue wasn't I wasn't checking to see if they put them out of order.

85
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,580
I was checking because they would turn up missing. This is your only opportunity you're ever going

86
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:34,059
to hear and find someone across the hallway who borrowed one without asking. And what do you know?

87
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:42,470
The DVD is missing from inside of its jewel case. Where did it go? No one knows. Oh, I found it.

88
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:48,259
It's in two pieces now. No, I'm not still angry about that. Is this part is this still closing

89
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,740
square bracket? No closing square bracket. There was once a man at an airport without a passport.

90
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:00,200
He was making a sound like a snort unable to retort. Good. As a last resort, he tried to act

91
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,179
like an athlete for a sport. He landed in a court which to him was like a resort. Taking public

92
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:15,720
transport, he went to a port. For his to port his height was listed which by all accounts was short.

93
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,740
Closing square bracket. One time at a friend's house I was hungry and looted his pan. How do

94
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,100
you talk? How do you speak with a TTS stream? I can't talk. This person's streaming for me.

95
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:39,220
Bear in mind two factors. This the robot is streaming for me. I can't even talk to you guys.

96
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:51,980
Hey, what's up? One time at a friend's house I was hungry and looted his pantry for something to eat.

97
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,379
I found a jar of what I had assumed to be homeless and attempted to open it. Oh,

98
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,899
you never do. Bear in mind two factors. I had a brand new shirt on and the lid on the jar still

99
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:08,490
had the sealing plastic on it. I used my shirt as a way to get extra grip against the protest

100
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,090
of my friends. One of which says you're going to spill the oil on the top all over your new shirt

101
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:20,649
to which I replied no the plastic is still on it. It's okay. Immediately after this the lid slid off

102
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:27,590
and I spilled oil all over my shirt. My next genius plan was to eat an entire spoonful of

103
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,590
the hummus which I did. That's not that bad. Only after realizing that the hummus in my mouth was

104
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,629
possibly the worst thing I have ever tasted I finally realized that the substance in the jar

105
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:45,029
was in fact raw garb and soybean paste. What? I ran to the sink and attempted to spit out the

106
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:51,029
glob now forming into a paste in my mouth only to realize to my horror that the paste had stuck to

107
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:56,389
every inch of my mouth between my teeth, under my tongue, and on the ridges on the roof of my mouth.

108
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,129
In desperation I attempted to turn the sink on to wash my mouth out and pulled up on what I

109
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,850
believed to be the sink's handle only for the handle to come off. What? Where are you? Is this

110
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:16,889
a home alone house? It was a soap dispenser. Hold on, I gotta turn these off. Are you sure?

111
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,929
Was like Macaulay Calkin fucking walking around? Did you like in your peripheral was like a little

112
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:29,289
kid running up the stairs going like oh and like having paint cans behind him? Okay, hold on,

113
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,210
I need to say I need a break from I gotta take a break here because I only did one of these.

114
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:48,330
I can't pay attention. It's been like two minutes. Has it? It has been like 15. It's been 16 minutes.

115
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:56,440
All right, well there's fireman. There's another fireman. Looks good. Very cool. That one's that

116
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,799
one's that was not that was less interpretation. That's more of like a true emo right there.

117
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:21,220
Looks good. Oh, I don't want to do that. Spy red. All right, I'm dubbed. Here comes another one.

118
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:35,500
I have to do these like individually guys. This is called Cheerio land. Wait, what happened to my

119
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:45,720
audio? There is a land called Cheerio land populated entirely by Cheerios. All of the

120
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,519
different Cheerios live in a caste system with the Honey Nut Cheerios in the leader class,

121
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,720
the Chocolate Cheerios acting as the Lords and Nobles, the Frosted Cheerios being the somewhat

122
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,330
well-off peasants and the normal Cheerios as the poor and destitute. One day, a normal Cheerio

123
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,210
fell in love with a Honey Nut Cheerio, but the only way he could see her was if he eventually

124
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,900
became a Honey Nut Cheerio himself. Okay. He goes to the Cheerio wizard who is the only person

125
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,220
capable of upgrading Cheerios to the next level. All right. After working hard for years under the

126
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,539
supervision of the Cheerio wizard, he is eventually upgraded to a Frosted Cheerio, a Chocolate Cheerio

127
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:32,619
and finally becomes a Honey Nut Cheerio. He meets the love of his life at last and together

128
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:39,720
they celebrate by going to a nearby fair. After a few hours, they get thirsty and they go to get

129
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,740
some fruit punch. However, they had to wait in a long line for lemonade because there was no punch

130
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:57,259
line. What? I fucked that whole thing up, didn't I? Hold on. There's no punch line. You don't write

131
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:02,759
a whole story like that, man. I don't have a punch line. Oh, because I went the other way, right?

132
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:09,529
Sorry. I was listening to the Cheerio, like the hierarchy system. I was having trouble paying

133
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:21,559
attention. Here we go. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. It's down here. What's going on here?

134
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:31,160
So we go 50. Oh, these are the sneakers. I see. Okay. You got me on this one. Hey, you got me.

135
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:49,339
Nice work. 59, 7, there it is. Another fireman. He wears sneakers? Oh, well, no, well, these things.

136
00:18:49,339 --> 00:19:01,799
His legs. Story time. Now. Hold on. We got plenty of time, so don't worry. Story. Now. Story. Now.

137
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:14,859
Story. Now. All right. Here, I'll give you two stories in a row. Okay. How's that sound?

138
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:37,369
Hopefully these hopefully these were vetted. Okay. Two stories back to back. Next image.

139
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,970
There used to be a boy who always jumped over the fence. His father told him not to jump over

140
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,930
the fence because every time he jumped over the fence, he broke a little bit of it. Not to say

141
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:55,910
that he was worried about his son, but the boy didn't listen and still jumped over and over.

142
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,509
Displeased and worried, the father broke the fence down and build a gate on the place where

143
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:07,819
once the fence was standing. Yet the boy still jumped over the gate even though he could easily

144
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:14,279
open it. So, the father left the gate open all the time and all kind of strangers traveled

145
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,680
trough the open gate and thanked the father for the easy passage and the father wondered,

146
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,210
did the boy did that on purpose? In the evening, he asked his son why he jumped over the fence

147
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,809
and gate and the son replied with a very simple response. I jumped over the fence to prove myself

148
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:38,059
that I'm not 5'3 and actually big enough to jump over. Suddenly the father jumped up and started

149
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,819
to make painful noises and he was not able to control his flatulence anymore while shouting at

150
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:51,769
his son, son I pay for your twitch prime so you better support that streamer! Exclamation mark!

151
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:57,880
And then something, tell me a sad story. Where is the joy in the life that you have lived?

152
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,170
And then he began to play a recording. He started with me, then it was Paul, and then it was myself.

153
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:13,910
It was great. And then it was all of us. It made me think, why is that so tragic? And I thought,

154
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:21,900
well, if they want you to find joy in death, we can do that. But we could not find joy in what we did.

155
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:28,839
And we didn't. Why didn't we find happiness in the moment? Then I remember going to the doctor

156
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:35,640
and talking to a psychiatrist. This doctor comes in and says, this is the most beautiful thing I've

157
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:44,490
ever seen. I said, it's just sad. She said, there is nothing beautiful about what you're saying.

158
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,170
And then she said, it's just something that must be given. It has to be given willingly.

159
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:57,609
What the fuck is this story? It was so difficult to find that. She talked to me for three hours and

160
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:03,480
told me that if you don't choose the path of joy, death won't have any meaning for you.

161
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,319
And then she said, you'll be happy. You have always loved life the way it's meant to be lived

162
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:18,490
and to come to terms with death and what it is. That's that one. All right. Nice. All right. It's

163
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:25,589
my turn to stream now. Thank you. We go back and forth here. So this is, it looks like German Venus.

164
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:36,250
I mean, no, that's too bad. We're sharing time here. This is definitely German Venus. I don't

165
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,130
know what I did wrong with the eye though. I think I fucked up the eye. The yellow wasn't

166
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:52,859
coming out that well. This is the mouth. It was 60. 60's over here. I might have to do smaller,

167
00:22:52,859 --> 00:23:04,700
a little smaller on the inside here. Use white? How do I use white on a white background?

168
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:13,240
That's just what my eye looks like. My eye doesn't look like that. 61. We might have to go,

169
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,990
I might have to go a tier lower for this. Yeah, we'll go, we'll go on a tier lower.

170
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:38,819
A finer line here. 62. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We're 69 in here. 69, 70. This looks fucked up.

171
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:57,799
73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80. It's coming together all the way up.

172
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,700
77, 88. All right. That actually doesn't look that bad. That looks pretty good.

173
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:13,210
89. It was 90. Straight up. And then this is the nose. This is going to be complicated up here.

174
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:19,529
100 and plus. 100 plus. Get a story. We'll get two new stories when I do a new, a new game board,

175
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:35,140
okay? 90, wait a minute. 90, 91, 92, 93. How's that, that doesn't work, does it? Do I have to

176
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:42,089
go like around? Like this, this? Cross the lines. Do I have to cross it? I thought you don't cross

177
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:55,130
the streams in a dot to dot. I get, oh wait, it's making the nostril. What does it make,

178
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:17,829
what's it making? I don't think that worked. I have to keep, I have to finish it. Hold on.

179
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:35,190
One, two, three. All the way around. Down here and then pull it back up here. 18, 19, 120,

180
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:59,670
121, 5, 26, 27. That's 20. All the way around. It's another circle. 30, 31, 32. All the way around

181
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:18,460
here. Where's 35? 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Hold on. Let's clean it up a little bit. Maybe get the,

182
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,220
let me get a little bit bigger. Let me see if I can get in here and just like clean it up.

183
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,660
This doesn't look right to me. It's, that's supposed to be the nose and I, did I go backwards?

184
00:26:39,619 --> 00:27:11,980
There it is. Let me see if I go like this. Yeah, no, no, it works. Very good. Hey, what do you say

185
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:20,859
we get a couple more stories? You guys like those? That was German Venus. Don't curve lines. Well,

186
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:29,079
I didn't look, see? Like I, I wasn't like curving. I was following it up here. I mean, you have to

187
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:39,819
curve. Otherwise, what are you gonna, I wouldn't curve them. All right, let's get another story on

188
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:59,130
here. Let's see. I'll do three this time. I just like saw the, you guys, I literally, okay,

189
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:17,690
these ones are long. This is a long ass story. The next two are like long ass stories. I don't,

190
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:23,210
I don't know. All I saw was the last word here. This might be a spoiler for Infinity War. Okay,

191
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,250
so just, if you haven't seen Infinity War, you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to leave

192
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:37,430
now. This might be an Infinity War Marvel spoiler. I just saw a word. Or just hurry up and go watch

193
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,900
the movie now. Just go watch one of those YouTube videos where they explain the whole story in like

194
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:50,220
four minutes. That's how long it's going to take to get there. All right, we'll do that one too.

195
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,519
Okay, here we go. Next. Next, please. No, I want to introduce the next one. I'm not just,

196
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,000
we're not gonna have to get blown out by the other streamer who's like more popular than I am. That's

197
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,279
the problem. The TTS guy is more popular than me right now and it's, I'm not okay with that.

198
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:45,109
I'm having trouble with that. Okay, so this one. All right, yeah, well, I'll put on the popular guy.

199
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,359
Hey guys, I had the circus come to my town last week and I had a lot of fun. Cool. The main

200
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:05,180
attraction was called the Short Streamer and my goodness, I never laughed so hard. The crowd kept

201
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:12,730
chanting ClayTF2 at him and he was very angry. I felt so bad for him, I bought him a drive.

202
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,849
Pepper after the show and he said that it was the nicest thing anyone ever did for him and I felt

203
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:24,359
so good about myself. About the month later, the Short Streamer wrote to me saying he got into a

204
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,559
fight with someone named Grill Mastic's BBQ and needed bits for the hospital bill. I wrote back

205
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,769
and said I couldn't help him but I wished him luck. The next week, someone who looked like he was

206
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:44,329
made of glue and wearing a cape stood outside of my door. I had to flee the state because I

207
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:51,349
feared for my life and hitched a balloon ride to Las Vegas. Turns out the Short Streamer was also

208
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:56,470
on this balloon with me and we had an epic fight which ended with me throwing him off over the

209
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,970
desert. I don't know where the Short Streamer or the glue man are but if you see anyone who looks

210
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:10,019
like that please report him to the authorities. Closing square bracket. Lights began to shine

211
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:15,980
through the vent grate. A faint light that could remind anyone of a comfy Boston basement.

212
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,940
Tim began to lightly step across the ventilation tunnel. His tired legs skittery on the steel as

213
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:30,380
he almost escaped. Freedom at last, Tim thought. Years of living in the vent of Jerma's cave,

214
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,220
he was finally in the home stretch. As he approached the vent, he could hear the faint

215
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,490
streamer in the chasms below. He couldn't entirely make him out but he could hear something about

216
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:49,660
dieting. It didn't matter to him. All that mattered was freedom from the dwarven dungeon.

217
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,240
His eyes peered through the vent and across the room he found his destination. The door on the

218
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,859
other side of the room. That must be it, he thought. Once he would be able to make it across, he would

219
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:08,059
most likely find the hallways of the gamer king he was always told about. It would lead him to

220
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:14,980
the world of outside. He couldn't dream of success yet. He still needed to fly across the chaotic pit.

221
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,970
The human dwarf hybrid resided. Tim could even see his followers on one of the monitors,

222
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:28,460
spamming a subtraction by two for some reason. Tim wasted no time. He flew through the vent

223
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,730
and onto the nearest surface he could find. He began to shake as this was the final moment

224
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:40,789
where it all mattered. Freedom from years of torment of living in Jerma's gamer cave.

225
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:48,859
No more. Snap. Closing square bracket. So, one day a church was looking for a replacement.

226
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:56,740
What's everybody mind? What did I do? Oh, the story. It's the story. Okay, I was like,

227
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:09,750
what happened? I'm just like drawing. What did I do? Oh, that was the word. I know it was in the

228
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,849
story. I don't know. I'm just a fucking idiot. Here it goes. Here comes the next story.

229
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:21,450
So, one day a church was looking for a replacement for the guy they had to climb the tower every

230
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:28,549
hour and ring the huge church bell. None of applicants were strong enough to do it. Well,

231
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:34,660
finally one day a man with no arms came up to apply for the job. The priest said,

232
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,980
but how can you ring it with no arms? And the man took a few steps back and ran head first

233
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:49,140
into the bell, getting it to ring. He got the job. He did his job well and was on time every hour.

234
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,339
Until one day after so many blows to the head, when he reared back and ran, he missed and went

235
00:33:54,339 --> 00:34:00,890
straight off the tower. As people started to gather around him on the ground, frantic, a woman asked

236
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:08,119
the man beside her, does anyone know who this is? The man replied, I don't know, but his face rings

237
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:20,099
a bell. What? What did I do? I fucked up something over here. What did I do over here? What happened

238
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:31,260
over here? No, I did this right. Oh, oh, oh, I know this is correct. This is actually correct.

239
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:43,110
This is, this is an earbud. Wow. That's detailed. All right. Where's 51? 51. I don't see 51.

240
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:56,280
50, 51. Where's 51? Did everybody see 51? I see 52, 51. There it is. Well, those are two excellent

241
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:16,309
stories. Excellent stories, I guess. 5, 56. Am I wearing a monocle? 58. That was three stories.

242
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:50,900
59, 60. Okay. 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70. Oh, fuck. I screwed it up. No, I didn't. 71, 72,

243
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:27,559
3. Up here, 74, 75, 76, 79. Is this my nose? 80, 81. Oh my god. 82, 83. I know what this is.

244
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:40,230
I know what this is. This is the, that thing. I already know it. I was wondering why this looks

245
00:36:40,230 --> 00:37:07,579
so fucked up. 87, 88, 89, 90, 82. Look at how tight these are. 93. Where's 94? There's 84,

246
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:41,030
93. Oh, it's right here. 4, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103. Oh, it's coming together. I can see it.

247
00:37:44,760 --> 00:38:15,130
104, 107. It's right in the middle here. 8, 10. This is fucking scary. It was 12. Right below.

248
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:50,550
12. Back up to 13. Where is the dot in 18? 18. Down. 120, 121. I look a fucking hundred years old.

249
00:38:50,630 --> 00:39:32,579
125, 126, 127, 128. That's wrong? What do you mean that's wrong? No, it's not. I missed 120. No,

250
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:47,900
I didn't, did I? Oh, fuck. I can't do that. Wait, let me just see where they are. Okay. No, I'm using

251
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,309
epic pen. Okay. That's not, what do you mean cheating? Everyone just told me to zoom in.

252
00:39:54,309 --> 00:40:03,110
All right. 117, 118, 119, 120. I got 120 last time.

253
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:26,539
22, 123, 4. Oh, that's fucking 5. 125. Is that it right there? Is that 125? I think so, right?

254
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:37,880
Right, okay. Right there. 126, 127, 128.

255
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:59,019
Those of you that are wondering if this just looks fucking horrible,

256
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:11,670
you always have to remember, this is, this image looks worse than this. The actual source image

257
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:20,710
looks worse than this. So, give me a break here. This is not about bad line work. You want us looking

258
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:28,570
at your ear the whole time? Fine, I'll sit back like this. Yeah, that'll be, I complained about

259
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,369
this already. That's the second image when you type in germa, 985 into Google. Thanks, guys.

260
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:50,199
Really looking forward to like getting that fucking TV show. 33, 34. Okay, then this goes

261
00:41:50,199 --> 00:42:25,829
up and around. Big eyebrow. 40, 41, 42, 43. Is my like skin melting? 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,

262
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:43,539
50, 51, 54, 67, 58, 59, 160, 161. It's done. There you are. Oh, also, what I, I forgot to do is,

263
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:52,090
I need a, I just need a white screen. Hold on. Because after I'm done, I want to just put them

264
00:42:52,090 --> 00:43:11,349
on a white screen. I think I should be able to do that with just, I just need a white, hold on.

265
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:16,309
Let me turn this off for a second. I need to find it. Where is it? No, not this, this.

266
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:35,369
Give me one second. I need to make like a new window. Yeah, that's better. Okay. Here we go.

267
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:42,809
Just a pure white screen. No, I don't want a 24-hour video of a white screen. Why the

268
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:50,730
fuck does that exist? I just want a white background. 24 hours of white screen. 10 hours

269
00:43:50,730 --> 00:44:09,539
of incredible white screen. I just want a fucking wallpaper. Okay, that's, that's good. Why? All

270
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:20,260
right. So, uh, that's good. I'm just going to go like this and I can hide it. So here we go.

271
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:41,820
You ready? Are you ready to see? Here is what we're looking at now. I think it actually looks

272
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:52,489
pretty good. Good Lord, the tabs. Welcome to the rest of your life on this string. You look like

273
00:44:52,489 --> 00:45:06,860
Ron Swanson. No, there we go. I can see that. All right, let's keep going. Let's get a couple

274
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:24,730
of stories. Okay. We'll do three stories this time. This is just a warm up guys.

275
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:31,510
Just wait till we get to the where's wall though. Using ad block plus instead of uBlock origin.

276
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:50,469
I don't fucking know. Guys, I only use ad block for the websites that take over your whole computer.

277
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:58,389
You know what I'm saying? I only use ad block for the websites that have a whole like, they go like

278
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:02,070
this. You open up the webpage and then you see a banner ad and you're like, okay, whatever. I don't

279
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:07,269
care. And then that banner ad scrolls down with you and takes over the whole page. It's another page

280
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:13,239
on top of the page. I don't know why people think that's a good idea. It is the fucking dumbest

281
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:18,119
thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It's like, it's like, if you went to like CVS, right? You

282
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,000
were walking into CVS and somebody was just standing in front of you screaming in your face

283
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,440
and they're going like this and they're getting in your fucking way and blocking you and screaming

284
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,469
in your face. It's like, look, I just want to go into the CVS. Okay. I don't care. You stand over

285
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:37,510
there and you scream. Okay. Stand to the side of the door and fucking yell in my face, like from

286
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:45,050
like eight feet away. Hey, hey. All right. That guy's, I gotta get past that guy. Don't put it

287
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:51,019
right here. Don't make me move and you're just on my fucking body. Stand like over there and scream

288
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:57,219
at me while I'm going into the CVS. If I see a website that does that, it immediately goes on

289
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:09,449
my shit list. Why do I use a CVS as a store example every time? Because it's CVS every 15 feet.

290
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:22,489
There's a CVS literally every fucking like 10 feet in America. Show us your search history.

291
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,460
No, I'm not going to show you my fucking search history. Do you know why that is?

292
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:40,519
It has nothing to do with- Oh, wait a minute. We might see his pornography. No, like I don't

293
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:46,699
want- I got like bank information in here. Oh, let me hit P. No, there's all my- that's all my bank

294
00:47:46,699 --> 00:48:03,500
accounts. Oh, that's funny. You better got him. He's scared. I don't- I don't want you to know

295
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:10,699
what I- like I may have typed in like a restaurant that's down the street. Like, oh, whoops.

296
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:22,150
No, you ain't getting shit. Uh-uh. That ain't fucking happening. This is all you get. All you

297
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:27,210
get, you can just imagine what all those tabs are. Show us every tab. Yeah, you can just imagine

298
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:33,610
what's on there, huh? In fact, I'll show you the next one. All right, let's go. All right,

299
00:48:33,610 --> 00:49:05,929
I got stories to tell. Bear guards? What the fuck is this one? This is so long. Oh my god. Okay,

300
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:09,530
we're just doing two because this one is like three- this one's like three minutes long at least.

301
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:23,320
Hey, you guys relaxed yet? Here we go. Don't you wish you could see those fucking tabs? Man,

302
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:32,570
I wish we could see those fucking tabs. I'll zoom in for this one because I can- I can- it can fit.

303
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:54,760
See? The man stands in a room of glass. In front of him is a table with a bowl. Inside the bowl

304
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:01,960
is a berry. Surrounding the room people scream and shout. Some yell, eat the berry. While others

305
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,039
yell, don't eat the berry. It's poisoned. The man looks around the room and sees the berry.

306
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,840
He places a fork under the berry and chews on it. The man places another fork under the berry and

307
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:21,269
chews again. At this point, the man realizes he has eaten poison, thus giving a death sentence

308
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:26,699
to anyone trying to make it through the maze. What? He runs through the maze until he is

309
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:33,579
outside the cave surrounded by many poisonous berries. Suddenly, the man collapses on his back,

310
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:40,500
screaming. At this point, all eyes are on the man. His eyes are full of poison and he wants to escape.

311
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:47,190
However, he is surrounded by hundreds of berry hunters. Some of them fight, some just sit there,

312
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,789
waiting the turn to fight. I can't do this. Eventually, the man breaks free and takes off.

313
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:57,909
The man takes off with all of the other bears and they run after him, as all the berry hunters turn

314
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:04,539
towards the man and laugh at how pathetic he is. The man tries to flee, but before he can do so,

315
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:10,599
the bear guards arrive and shackle him. They take him back to the room he was in originally and

316
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:17,559
place another berry down on the table. They then leave, and the cycle starts again. Written by

317
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:24,900

00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:36,469
that there was a four person swimming pool battle royale where you eliminate people by either

325
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:42,119
beating them unconscious in the pool or knocking them out of the pool after numerous failures

326
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,840
against children i knew that i needed to step up my game i put on a snorkel and immediately became

327
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:56,679
a god at the game soon enough i made it to the big leagues my competition was big geo with

330
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:19,000
goggles after the round and i made a full rebound geo and the lime watched in horror from the ceiling

331
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,650
as i pummeled geocchio i snatched the lime from the ceiling and drowned him eliminating him geo

332
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:33,050
was a different story approaching him was too risky to do head-on while i was catching my breath

333
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:40,659
he managed to pin my arm to the poolside i began to panic but opportunity struck the lime's dead

334
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:47,110
body floated near me and as geo delivered another web shot i threw the lime at geo the collision

364
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:39,449
long as i can remember i've always had a fascination with birds i always like to spot them with big

365
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:46,139
binoculars i borrowed from my parents and write them down in my big blue bird book i would write

366
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:52,860
things like new blue feathered sparrow making a nest in the big oak tree and such i would even

367
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:58,840
put photographs next to it the description sometimes so anyway it's quite natural then

368
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:05,719
that when i saw a small redheaded woodpecker on the sidewalk i was curious woodpeckers aren't city

369
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:13,079
birds in fact i don't think i've ever seen one outside of the woods what was it doing here

370
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:19,579
was it lost maybe it was hurt sir i sneakily walked up to it preparing to pick it up and take

371
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:26,070
it home to care for it and release it back into the forest it was just walking across the sidewalk

372
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:33,260
for some reason not even flying as i came closer though i could make out its details more and more

373
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:40,179
clearly and they just didn't make sense this all culminated when i was standing only one or two

374
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:47,670
feet away from the little creature and it turned around and i t spoke who a who a who a ha ha who a

375
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:55,769
who a who a ha ha who a who a who a ha ha so naturally i took out my flamethrower and torched

376
01:01:55,769 --> 01:02:02,360
that down to the ground i already warned that psychotic little ship never to come within 10

377
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:15,530
feet of me again after he drilled my previous house to the ground good riddance what did that

401
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:12,280
we're gonna move on the idea is if somebody's talking in your ear and trying to interrupt your

402
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:17,079
conversation eventually you're gonna be like i can't hear i cannot talk to this person about

01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:49,579
over your fucking screen that make a bunch of noise and then tell me that i'm incorrect with this

410
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:21,380
all last night why would lying in bed for what seems to be an hour as well as getting a little

411
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:27,859
unnerved i can't help but return to my computer and used my time watching past vod's of this twitch

412
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:34,489
streamer i'm very familiar with he's a popular streamer yet unfamiliar to some being he is the

413
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:38,970
top 1000 streamer but me and him have a sort of history going between this

414
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:46,619
i met this person a long time ago at a twitch party and we were seemingly getting along i thought

415
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:53,319
i'm still really upset on what he said to me my name and to my fans that went to his stream

416
01:08:53,319 --> 01:09:00,039
of course the past is the past but somehow his words still affect me to this day i haven't

417
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:05,960
grilled for a long time mainly through physical issues on my back and hopefully one day i can

418
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,880
return to what i enjoy a lot my therapist is currently helping me through all this and

419
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:18,819
hopefully with enough exercise and healthy foods i will return streaming again never really hated

421
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:31,340
chat repeating the words peepee poo poo but really i hope our conflict in the past won't affect our

relationship now for all you remaining griller fans keep up with my twitter for more steamy

440
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:28,569
the woods one day when i came across a little door carved into the stump of an old oak tree

441
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:33,930
magical stuff okay i knelt down and knocked carefully with one finger hoping not to startle

442
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:40,100
its inhabitant the little door slowly creaked open and out popped the head of a curious little

443
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:49,239
creature it asks in a tiny timid voice just a traveler i respond do you mind if i poke my

444
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:56,899
head inside not at all replies the creature retreating back into its hovel i lay down on

445
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:01,939
my stomach and open the door and as soon as i stick my head through the opening the gremlin

446
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:10,199
rips ass all over my face i recoil in disgust and destroy its entire house god i fucking hate

about this one not the story the the image one time i was at my local walmart minding my business

495
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:20,340
when i felt something brush against my leg glancing down i chuckled as i saw a small child who only

496
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:27,380
came up to around my knees walking past with an armful of cheesy watch where you're going kid i

497
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:33,859
said smiling at him before turning away suddenly i felt a sharp pain in my foot and looked down

498
01:25:33,859 --> 01:25:40,279
to see the small child underneath me glaring up angrily at the comparative giant above him

499
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:46,680
what the heck did you just call me he demanded in a surprisingly deep bostonian accent that

500
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:53,770
sounded familiar i leant down to examine the child more closely before recoiling in shock

501
01:25:53,770 --> 01:26:01,460
this was no child it was germa i'll have you know i'm a top 1000 streamer who beat dark souls 3

502
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:09,180
on stream germa continued his comically small face contorted with rage naturally i quickly

503
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:16,300
apologized and asked for a photo declaring he was my favorite compact streamer eventually after

504
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:22,220
promising 10 000 bits as compensation for the cheesy i had squashed germa let me take a photo

505
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:30,539
with him it was kim who was about my height she hurried over and scooped up the reluctant germa

506
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:37,159
in her arms before depositing him in her shopping trolley where he saturday with his arms crossed

507
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:43,000
she thanked me for taking care of him and talked him into accepting 1000 bits from me instead

508
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:56,619
before bidding her farewells and walking away just once and will there ever be a story where

509
01:26:56,619 --> 01:27:03,720
i'm not like the little mutant that like bites people why would why can't somebody tell a story

548

549
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:10,229
psycho i'll be sitting in public i get a especially at a restaurant i if i have a big sneeze and i'm

550
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:16,550
in a restaurant i i don't want to do that i don't want to be the person that hold on another one

551
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:24,060
i don't want to be the person that everybody looks over to and goes what the fuck because

552
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,460
regardless everybody coughs everybody sneezes everybody it happens you get like the thing your

553
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:33,180
this sensitivity and your nose and you end up doing it right whatever but you feel horrible

554
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:36,220
when you do that if i'm sitting in like a nice restaurant all of a sudden you're like

555
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:43,899

556
01:35:43,899 --> 01:35:50,539
the eyes looking at me so when i'm at a restaurant it's like i dump it into the back of my eyes

557
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:57,180
you contrary to popular belief when you hold in a sneeze it's not like your throat or your chest

558
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:02,539
or your your nose that actually has the pain and the suffering it's your eyes so when i like you

559
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:09,659
you sneeze like back here in the back of your eyes and it's like so that's why you try to do it

560
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:13,819
in a way where you can sneeze but still not sneeze so right there what happened was just pull the

561
01:36:13,819 --> 01:36:20,119
clip back i sneezed but it was like i got all of it out that i needed to i didn't hold it in i'm

01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:20,680
through a field of corn down a lonely dirt road went to my right i passed an ugly old scarecrow

648
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:28,039
his face was dirty and covered in straw his arm sticks with gloves nailed on his straw had let

649
01:54:28,039 --> 01:54:35,060
more light through than it kept out i glanced at him and quickly turned away his gaze was too stern

650
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:41,859
his face too creepy along the path i went not sure where i was going or where i'd been

651
01:54:41,859 --> 01:54:48,649
i see the scarecrow up ahead as if i'd somehow gone back a mile but i hadn't you couldn't get

652
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:56,199
lost on a path straight as this i kept going shying away from his gaze as i kept walking i

653
01:54:56,199 --> 01:55:03,720
saw him again and again i lost my nerve and ran ran as fast as i could until i didn't see him

654
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:11,560
anymore i felt confident and shouted with joy spinning around ecstatic in victory only i was

655
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:18,630
cut short because on the path behind me there he was in the middle of the dirt road i stood stock

656
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:26,489
still too scared to breath once again i panic and sprint running until i lose my breath i glance

657
01:55:26,489 --> 01:55:33,340
behind me and he's only closer i turn to keep running but there he is again closer still i

658
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:40,380
keep turning and turning too scared and confused to know what's happening until there he is in

715
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:22,739
called tale from the tomb raider for some sort of convention in 2014 the tomb raider title is

716

being developed by a group of team members and they're actually talking about a new game cerny

one of these days we're going to announce that game at e3 this year or soon after or maybe even

02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:41,979
early next year but at this point we're actually trying to convince people to actually buy and

719
02:08:41,979 --> 02:08:47,899
play the game instead of just to enjoy the game and see their own photos in its world

720
02:08:47,899 --> 02:08:59,029
but as far as we know this isn't a sequel or reboot right now sir i know it's not called

727
02:10:46,010 --> 02:11:15,430
brackets anymore i love them out of brackets okay here we go next image what the fuck is this one

728
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:31,449
one time in seventh grade one was trying to jump down the stairs to impress all the girls

729
02:11:31,449 --> 02:11:36,970
i was leaning forward from the top step and holding the railing about halfway down the stairs

730
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:43,770
planning on swinging from the top to the bottom well my hand slipped and i ended up tumbling head

731
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:51,079
over heels down the stairs and i landed flat on my back i tried to recover all cool by sitting up

732
02:11:51,079 --> 02:11:57,640
and saying well that just happened and went to my next class which was gym i think we played dodge

733
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:04,739
ball or something whatever it was it was pretty boring then after class my teacher came up to me

734
02:12:04,739 --> 02:12:12,359
and said did you fall down the stairs earlier today i said yeah but it's not big deal she told

735
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:17,720
me to go to the nurse's office which i did and when i told them what happened they called my

736
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:24,979
mom and sent me home so i got to go home early and watch tv because i tried and failed to impress

737
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:32,550
some girls in seventh grade pretty good deal if i'm honest closing square bracket that's a cool

738
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:38,310
story parts of this story in an online chat room i mean but i thought it's worth sharing it in their

739
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:45,100
entirety i had two dreams recently that had an individual that must have made some impact with

740
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:51,689
how dreams work and remembering them is uncommon the recent dream had him crashing at my place to

741
02:12:51,689 --> 02:12:58,779
avoid paying for a hotel originally thinking it was gonna be an awkward experience we ended up just

742
02:12:58,779 --> 02:13:06,069
talking story on the couch and at the beach the first dream though we driving around north shore

743
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:11,989
sunny day ocean peeking over the hill in front empty fields on either side with an occasional

744
02:13:11,989 --> 02:13:18,869
tree grove to break up the monogamy it was just us and the road eventually they pulled off the

745
02:13:18,869 --> 02:13:25,340
road to park i watched them step out and round the front and with no rhyme or reason they started to

746
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:33,300
take the pants off shocked i grabbed for the door handle but i woke up before i could heart pounding

747
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:40,649
with the dream still fresh i mumbled since when did you drive joma if they ever read this somehow

748
02:13:40,649 --> 02:13:47,289
thank you so much for the talk it was fun and we had a lot of laughs i'm also said some things

749
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:53,529
that were uplifting and made me reflect on some things gosh i really wish i could remember what

750
02:13:53,529 --> 02:13:59,859
was said thank you again but what are you talking about i think i should be flattered but you know

751
02:13:59,859 --> 02:14:07,300
first impressions are important right closing square bracket one two oatmeal kirby is wanted

752
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:14,229
on four counts of homicide and seven counts of grand theft larceny kirby was last seen in dream

753
02:14:14,229 --> 02:14:21,340
land sucking off bark from these weird face trees officers tried to detain kirby but he managed to

754
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:28,170
escape by eating them whole there were absolutely no survivors but we managed to recover this

755
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:34,970
information off of the live feed of one of our officers we believe that kirby's current motives

756
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:42,149
are to overtake king ddd and quote wear his ass like a helmet we can only speculate the motives

757
02:14:42,149 --> 02:14:48,949
his partner meta knight was also seen blowing a guy in the alley if you see kirby do not approach

758
02:14:48,949 --> 02:14:56,090
him if he offers you oatmeal he's trying to fuck you do not approach him he will get inside of you

759
02:14:56,090 --> 02:15:03,430
any way he can he is a dangerous and lethal character do not go near him i know this first

760
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:09,029
hand because when i was in the field and he was just a new suspect i thought oh that's just a

761
02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:28,409
little pink blob he's not gonna do anything three stories i am having a lot of trouble trying to

762
02:15:28,409 --> 02:16:00,119

770
02:18:44,819 --> 02:18:52,940
this one okay i'm having like i'm having fun just browsing through the stories and trying to figure

771
02:18:52,940 --> 02:19:00,100
out if this is a real story a fake story or you made this in talk to transformer i think half of

772
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:16,139

02:20:11,290 --> 02:20:18,780
huge bear like the bear was at least five feet tall and must have been heavier than my mom's sedan

777
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:24,219
my the bear my pa told me to stay low so that it wouldn't sense us i found that funny since i

778
02:20:24,219 --> 02:20:30,780
didn't know bears come with a radar we ended up going fishing afterward because my pa told me

779
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:38,760
bears can't swim closing square bracket jeremy elbertson is a clown his father is an alcoholic

780
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:45,319
so when elbertson began acting as a stand-up comedian it seemed a natural fit but elbertson

781
02:20:45,319 --> 02:20:51,159
doesn't just act like he's doing a performance wait he's actually training and he's living a

782
02:20:51,159 --> 02:20:55,959
life that is full of stress and responsibility what happened with this one elbertson is trying

783
02:20:55,959 --> 02:21:01,479
to reach happiness but as he puts it my main goal right now is to go through the stages of

784
02:21:01,479 --> 02:21:07,479
grief and get it over with what with his mother dead and his father battling addiction elbertson

785

reasons for his struggle how he got there and what's next all while helping some students take the

787
02:21:17,559 --> 02:21:24,649
first steps into stand-up comedy you've already done a comedy album but you're a jerk what inspired

788
02:21:24,649 --> 02:21:30,809

833
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:40,659
music on let's go when i was younger my father would take me to my bedroom door frame and measure

834
02:30:40,659 --> 02:30:47,219
my height with a marker once a month that evening i remember waking up on the first of every month

835
02:30:47,219 --> 02:30:53,940
excited that i would be able to see how far i have grown since the previous month now as a child i

836
02:30:53,940 --> 02:31:00,520
always had a head larger than my body the doctor said that this is normal for a child of my age

837
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:07,079
and that my body will eventually catch up to the size of my head after a few years i had finally

838
02:31:07,079 --> 02:31:12,920
reached an impasse my head was somewhat normal sized and my full height on the door frame was

839
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:19,559
a humbling five feet six inches my father told me that since i was at my later teenage years that

840
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:26,299
my body would stop growing as fast this disappointed me perhaps i would grow more in a few years

841
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:32,540
13 years later i was sick and tired of it all i tried getting into really good shape ate super

842
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:38,709
healthy and even went to a chiropractor to make my back the straightest there is i didn't even

843
02:31:38,709 --> 02:31:46,309
get one centimeter then just yesterday i decided to change the formula around i cut my hair short

844
02:31:46,309 --> 02:31:51,510
it stretches all day listens when yeah and went to bed super early without measuring my height

845
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:58,469
the next morning i woke up and immediately measured myself i grew two centimeters guys

846
02:31:58,469 --> 02:32:05,430
there's still hope for us short folks out there keep trying closing square bracket sky went into

847
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:09,989
germa's stream the other day and he was just doing this impression of two viewers talking

848
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:15,750
it was really weird he would act like one of the viewers had recommended the stream to the other

849
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:21,129
but that that viewer had become disillusioned with the stream after seeing something weird

850
02:32:21,129 --> 02:32:27,190
yeah it was just strange man not sure what i expected but please don't link me to that streamer

851
02:32:27,190 --> 02:32:36,229
ever again thank you closing square bracket germa 985 wanted to go to the potluck as a member of the

852
02:32:36,229 --> 02:32:41,670
community after a lot of back and forth he got his own pass with a note to the people that were

853
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:47,670
coming for the event i would really appreciate your attendance what that was how most of my friends

854
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:51,989
made their way here they came by their friends and told them where to start going

855
02:32:52,969 --> 02:32:57,450
it's kind of a shame that the people in charge of keeping the community running don't share that

856
02:32:57,450 --> 02:33:05,670
same mindset when asked if he was expecting a big response from his own friends no i mean it's not

857
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:10,969
even close we have probably only a couple of hundred people that are showing up to see the

858
02:33:10,969 --> 02:33:17,190
first time we put on the event that may have been the result of just a few hundred people showing up

859
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:22,620
and a lot of that might not have been the result of that there wasn't really any indication that

860
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:28,309
something was going to take off like this for us just who this is who were coming would appreciate

861

1006
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:09,319
my hand so no that wouldn't help i would just spend money on a tablet just for no reason

1010
03:17:35,379 --> 03:17:43,059
music this is the relaxing portion of the stream hopefully maybe if you got a fireplace

03:20:26,549 --> 03:20:29,750
f i i got overwhelmed by the amount of numbers but no they're very much

1023
03:20:29,750 --> 03:20:40,739
tightly knit together to go through them oh no no no no don't go that easy don't

05:17:09,509 --> 05:17:13,990
theater purchased two different films by mistake the projectionist can't tell which one is the

1417
05:17:13,990 --> 05:17:20,069
real one can you find 20 differences between the posters 20 differences so that they know which

1418
05:17:20,150 --> 05:17:32,200
film is the genuine one tip one for text each part that's been replaced counts as one change

1419
05:17:32,200 --> 05:17:40,229
okay there are many subtle changes but small differences in position don't count right so

1420
05:17:40,229 --> 05:17:50,119
oh this is a half a quarter of an inch taller than this one no all right look at 20 we got

1421

1422
05:18:00,439 --> 05:18:06,380

1506
05:38:56,680 --> 05:39:10,299
they're bent the i'm i'm leaning forward bending my knees and slumping down right now the i i if

1507
05:39:10,299 --> 05:39:18,069
i were to extend my knees and look at look at i'm out in front i'm not side to side here look at

1509
05:39:28,500 --> 05:39:41,720
down see i'm leaning forward and down if i extend these legs i come up from here to here right here

1510
05:39:41,799 --> 05:39:53,700
is the line where i would be if i were standing up straight i don't know how many times i have to

1511
05:39:53,700 --> 05:40:13,560
go over this i'll go over this a thousand times take a look at this too i want you to see this

1512
05:40:13,560 --> 05:40:30,740

1514
05:40:42,279 --> 05:40:51,099
but do you think that my look i hold on this is the ground you want to talk about like oh

1517
05:41:05,909 --> 05:41:22,619
from the ground that would mean i would have to have like four and a half foot long arms and that's

1518
05:41:22,619 --> 05:41:26,700
just evidence here that's i'll draw a little thing for you just to get this out of the way

1545
05:46:55,110 --> 05:46:58,790
stabbed himself so hard that he somehow managed to create an alternate dimension where there are

1546
05:46:58,790 --> 05:47:04,310
only ten subtle differences pretty boring actually seriously you can't even make an interesting

1547
05:47:04,310 --> 05:47:16,709
dimension damn clone this is awesome this is like fucking fantastic all right let's go i'm

1552
05:48:06,549 --> 05:48:12,310
think that that's like how long my real chin is and then it's like oh wow germa's not only five

1553
05:48:12,310 --> 05:48:20,470
two he also has like a big goblin chin that one's actually true though unfortunately for me yeah

1554
05:48:20,470 --> 05:48:25,590
that is actually true so i mean what can i what am i gonna do about that right you measure my chin

1578
05:55:00,500 --> 05:55:08,470
hours but there was a lot there was a ton of uh contributions so there still is a bunch of jokes

i was really only supposed to stream for three or four but i was having too much fun with all

1583
05:55:54,279 --> 05:56:03,500
this stuff i did most of the stories the stories were ridiculous too jokes and brain teasers i can

1584
05:56:03,500 --> 05:56:11,020
compile and do them and i might just do that i might just pull them out randomly like whenever

1598
05:58:23,319 --> 05:58:33,130
or anything but it's gonna sound uh maybe weird to some of you this was a test of community night

1599
05:58:33,130 --> 05:58:46,819
stuff this is a test i tested you i think you you i think it was great i wanted to do something

1600
05:58:46,819 --> 05:58:54,340
chill and i wanted to have a bunch of community contributed stuff artwork i wanted to see how

1601
05:58:54,340 --> 05:59:03,930
long it would take to do this kind of stuff i have a pretty good idea of submissions and

1602
05:59:04,889 --> 05:59:13,139
all the mods that were involved in it too thank you everybody for making the stream like this

1603
05:59:13,139 --> 05:59:20,970
happened i knew i wanted something the day before i was pretty much going to leave to just be

1604
05:59:20,970 --> 05:59:24,970
relaxing and hang out and just see how a community night went this is a community night this is the

1605
05:59:24,970 --> 05:59:41,080
first one essentially is the one what you just watched thank you for being a part of it let's

1606
05:59:41,159 --> 05:59:51,400
continue on to the bits earlier today we had five dollars from bake me home you should have a

1607
05:59:51,400 --> 05:59:59,060
contest to design a germa odin emote don't give us any prompts just let us come up with what we

1608
05:59:59,060 --> 06:00:12,439
think germa odin should be i probably will do another emote contest eventually i have i have

1609
06:00:12,439 --> 06:00:24,299
like a lot of slots now they need to be filled i just need to get on it but that's not a bad idea

1610
06:00:29,220 --> 06:00:39,049
thank you slalom for the five dollars my colonoscopy went well thanks germ and then

1611
06:00:39,049 --> 06:00:50,180
they say come to brazil uh that's i'm really happy to hear that it went well i told you it's easy it's

1612
06:00:50,180 --> 06:00:59,259
a lot more strange and nerve-wracking than the procedure actually is so i'm glad to hear it went

1613
06:00:59,259 --> 06:01:16,200
well thank you so much for the five dollars germa wild one wild two wild three uh yeah the prep is

1614
06:01:16,200 --> 06:01:22,020
the worst part of this the the thing about a colonoscopy is just not being able to eat

1615
06:01:22,819 --> 06:01:27,740
once you cross that threshold of not being able to eat solid food for two or three straight days

1616
06:01:28,619 --> 06:01:41,500
is when you start to succumb to madness just drinking clear chicken broth and eating jello

1617
06:01:43,500 --> 06:01:55,400
is gah it's horrible and the worst part is even when after you're done you still you're all kind

1618
06:01:55,400 --> 06:01:59,240
of fucked up so you you're not the second you get out of a colonoscopy you're not sitting there

1619
06:01:59,240 --> 06:02:05,240
going oh where can't wait to go to burger king no you're like on like drugs and shit you just

1620
06:02:05,240 --> 06:02:15,369
want to go home and go to bed and just relax and maybe eat something small but i'm glad to

1621
06:02:15,369 --> 06:02:21,029
hear it went well thank you for the five dollars thank you to sam freelance police for the five

1622
06:02:21,029 --> 06:02:27,430
dollars germa i gave you five dollars on the dragon's lair stream but you got coxed so you

1623
06:02:27,430 --> 06:02:34,150
never saw it i'm sorry about that i hate when that happens because it just deletes every sub

1624
06:02:34,150 --> 06:02:40,950
and every bit that was there and then having to go back and sort of reread everything is almost

1625
06:02:40,950 --> 06:02:45,669
like that a day or two has gone by and it's none of it it's relevant none of it's relevant anymore

1626
06:02:45,669 --> 06:02:49,830
for the day in that few hours i just always feel fucking terrible when it happens so

1627
06:02:51,319 --> 06:02:54,520
we sometimes try to go back and i've done it a few times going back and reading them

1628
06:02:56,220 --> 06:03:00,860
but i'm sorry that it happened i wish i could correct it i wish that stuff didn't happen but

1629
06:03:01,259 --> 06:03:12,790
does but they say uh i've been watching your stuff since i was like 13 i'm 19 now

1630
06:03:13,939 --> 06:03:18,819
i just left my home country of portugal to move to germany for game design university

1631
06:03:19,380 --> 06:03:25,060
this is my first night all alone you have any tips on living alone far away from your parents

1632
06:03:25,060 --> 06:03:30,819
thanks for all the laughs and for being with me on the journey uh that sounds like quite a journey

1633
06:03:32,150 --> 06:03:41,580
yeah congratulations going to a game design university it's awesome the i don't know how

1634
06:03:43,180 --> 06:03:47,500
relevant this is to you but it was very relevant for me and i don't know what the

1635
06:03:48,220 --> 06:03:53,500
obviously it might not be possible with you know being at a university or wherever you're living

1636
06:03:53,500 --> 06:04:00,810
at the university or something but i lived alone for a very long time and the number one thing

1637
06:04:00,889 --> 06:04:08,009
that i would say to anybody that lives alone is get a dog get a dog get a cat get an animal get

1638
06:04:08,009 --> 06:04:20,779
some kind of companion because then you're not and if that's not possible you know obviously if

1639
06:04:20,779 --> 06:04:29,689
you can't bring into a living situation a a friend like a pet a companion right then the best thing

1640
06:04:29,689 --> 06:04:39,849
you can do is to try to find stuff to do that you're interested in that you can find other

1641
06:04:39,849 --> 06:04:46,009
people that like the same shit that you do i've said this advice before but everybody's on the

1642
06:04:46,009 --> 06:04:53,590
same fucking page nobody knows anybody and all you have are your interests everything else is

1643
06:04:53,590 --> 06:05:02,779
left completely at the door nobody knows anybody nobody knows how you were in high school nobody

1644
06:05:02,779 --> 06:05:07,580
knows who your friends are nobody knows what your life is like or who you kind of are as a person

1645
06:05:08,700 --> 06:05:20,709
so you're only basing stuff on interests and if you can find a group of people that are interested

1646
06:05:20,709 --> 06:05:27,259
in the same thing you kind of just start at that i like this you like this too i don't know who you

1647
06:05:27,259 --> 06:05:31,819
are and you don't know me either but we're literally sitting next to each other in this fucking class

1648
06:05:32,900 --> 06:05:39,000
and i like that shit too and then you just start talking you just start hanging out you start doing

1649
06:05:39,000 --> 06:05:42,759
group projects a lot of colleges do that they do group projects and they put you together and

1650
06:05:43,479 --> 06:05:58,119
that's really the the way to do it or have like i said get an animal because if you have an animal

1651
06:05:58,119 --> 06:06:04,630
you are you're never alone because that whatever like for instance auto right i was always alone

1652
06:06:05,430 --> 06:06:12,250
in that place that i was living in it's just me and auto and that was it and you know sometimes

1653
06:06:12,250 --> 06:06:15,610
it was a little weird you know i'd get up and i'd make food and it's just like okay like

1654
06:06:15,930 --> 06:06:24,169
i'm like creeping up the stairs and there's no humans but no i but it didn't matter because

1655
06:06:24,169 --> 06:06:28,569
within five seconds of me thinking about that oh there's auto lying on the pillow hey auto and

1656
06:06:28,569 --> 06:06:36,619
he's like hi i'm here i'm happy to see you so you get to essentially have that kind of interaction

1657
06:06:36,619 --> 06:06:45,139
with something take it for a walk play around lie down on the couch with them and stuff like that

1658
06:06:45,139 --> 06:06:54,709
it was it was always very easy to just chill with your little furry friend but hopefully

1659
06:06:54,709 --> 06:07:02,279
that helps good luck take care thank you for the five dollars sam freelance police appreciate it

1660
06:07:04,459 --> 06:07:08,060
50 thanks for the four dollars and eight cents i bet you there is at least one triangle picture

1661
06:07:08,060 --> 06:07:14,299
there was i did not use it uh the other one that i was considered there was a there's one or two

1662
06:07:14,299 --> 06:07:22,119
others that i didn't like maybe three maybe four total well i i've you know 2020 hindsight

1663
06:07:23,240 --> 06:07:28,119
there was like three or four of the of the vine meats and i was gonna use one and then i was like

1664
06:07:28,119 --> 06:07:37,669
oh wow i just glossed over them and instead i put in the just circle of the germa sun it was just

1665
06:07:37,669 --> 06:07:41,990
the one that was a circle i don't know why i was like yeah i guess i'll just not put that i don't

1666
06:07:41,990 --> 06:07:47,180
know why i didn't put that in i think it's because i saw two or three of them in a row and there was

1667
06:07:47,180 --> 06:07:51,979
like three or four fireman's in a row right there too so i was like oh shit i don't want to have

1668
06:07:51,979 --> 06:08:00,970
maybe i should do like maybe just change it up yes there was a triangle it's if you want to do it

1669
06:08:00,970 --> 06:08:03,529
it's pretty hard it's in that discord right now you can go look at it right now

1670
06:08:11,159 --> 06:08:18,200
nova ostra thanks for the three dollars hey germo you're the best streamer on twitch thank you you

1671
06:08:18,200 --> 06:08:25,479
always make me laugh no matter what you do love you that's just an insanely nice thing to have

1672
06:08:25,479 --> 06:08:32,490
anybody ever say thank you i just i'm just doing my thing here that's that's what that's all i'm

1673
06:08:32,490 --> 06:08:40,900
gonna do and that's all i ever will do i'm glad you enjoy the streams thank you hey plank thank

1674
06:08:40,900 --> 06:08:47,130
you plank v2 for the 20 bucks 20 dollars from plank if you went back 10 years and asked yourself

1675
06:08:47,130 --> 06:08:59,720
where you would be would you have pictured this thanks for making my days uh no there was no way

1676
06:08:59,720 --> 06:09:07,419
to predict that this is gonna happen because it didn't exist something like live streaming

1677
06:09:08,299 --> 06:09:17,880
whether it's video games or edited video type content or irl content or this stuff didn't exist

1678
06:09:19,419 --> 06:09:22,540
so there was no way to ever know this would ever be a thing that anybody did

1679
06:09:26,009 --> 06:09:34,020
even back with youtube youtube yeah i mean youtube was a thing but i never knew that i never thought

1680
06:09:34,020 --> 06:09:38,900
at all that youtube was going to turn into a way for me to make like money and be like a job

1681
06:09:38,900 --> 06:09:45,349
essentially in no way yeah there was you couldn't there was no monetization on videos

1682
06:09:46,150 --> 06:09:53,459
when i was making videos that happened a couple years really after i started at least a year or

1683
06:09:53,459 --> 06:09:59,459
two and then once it became knowledgeable that you could get ad revenue from your videos

1684
06:10:00,419 --> 06:10:09,419
the whole thing erupted erupted people started coming in and holy shit we can make money from

1685
06:10:09,419 --> 06:10:24,869
our youtube videos now and the whole space just went crazy i just kind of kept doing what i was

1686
06:10:24,869 --> 06:10:34,279
doing and i'll be honest not very much has changed in regards to how i approach what i do here

1687
06:10:39,049 --> 06:10:46,860
but no i there's no way i would have known what would i but what would i've done if i didn't do

1688
06:10:46,860 --> 06:10:55,590
it i would work with animals or something i've done volunteer work before with animal um

1689
06:10:58,009 --> 06:11:01,209
oh i can't think of the word animal shelters i've done

1690
06:11:02,490 --> 06:11:07,290
volunteer work with animal shelters i really maybe would have tried to been like a vet tech

1691
06:11:07,290 --> 06:11:15,259
or something i liked computers maybe i would have done some computer stuff it stuff i don't know i've

1692
06:11:15,259 --> 06:11:21,099
talked about a few times but i don't know i can't tell you who knows in 10 years i might be doing

1693
06:11:21,099 --> 06:11:27,049
that i can't predict you what's going to happen in five years 10 years no idea you could be a

1694
06:11:27,049 --> 06:11:38,569
mosquito doctor uh we had big bits just coming right now from the man himself phylactery lich

1695
06:11:40,419 --> 06:11:57,110
50 dollars from phylactery 5000 bits thank you again for the ultra money they say hey germa i'm

1696
06:11:57,110 --> 06:12:02,869
not going to be able to watch the carnival live i have to work so i can afford to give you more

1697
06:12:02,950 --> 06:12:14,389
subs can you go ahead and move it to sunday that would be great i tell you i i better be like

1698
06:12:14,389 --> 06:12:30,540
one percent of your income i better be like point two percent of your income he's he's getting

1699
06:12:30,540 --> 06:12:38,650
closer to owning 20 he's got 20 30 percent of the stream he doesn't own 50 of the company yet don't

1700
06:12:38,650 --> 06:12:48,650
do it no i can't change that that date is not something i am able to change remember it's not

1701
06:12:48,650 --> 06:13:00,619
just me i have hired two separate companies to make the stream possible all the robot contracting

1702
06:13:00,619 --> 06:13:07,659
out with andy mark to make the robots and then the company that is producing the actual stream

1703
06:13:07,659 --> 06:13:16,970
portion event location and crew they're hey can i do it on sunday instead it's like what the

1704
06:13:17,049 --> 06:13:21,639
fuck are you talking about no it's set in stone with these two different companies

1705
06:13:32,970 --> 06:13:38,099
and as much as it would you know every you always want more time but i don't think we don't need it

1706
06:13:41,060 --> 06:13:45,220
i mean you guys gotta remember i this has been something that's been being worked on for a few

1707
06:13:45,220 --> 06:14:00,630
months more than that so it's not a thing where it's like oh we can move it i guess i had to

1708
06:14:00,630 --> 06:14:11,900
liquidate bald coin for this one but there are multiple companies involved i mean i'm not

1709
06:14:11,900 --> 06:14:16,700
changing the date but if that if it ever came down to it if it was kind of just me and another

1710
06:14:16,700 --> 06:14:23,020
person and maybe one other thing and we contracted out robots and now there's like 20 people that are

1711
06:14:23,020 --> 06:14:38,229
involved in this split between two potentially even three different companies so no that's that

1712
06:14:38,229 --> 06:14:45,909
is that's completely out of my hands at this point we all agreed on a date that things could happen

1713
06:14:46,630 --> 06:14:51,110
when people were available for things when this company was going to be available

1714
06:14:52,950 --> 06:14:57,509
to produce it and where they were going to produce it those are all things that i cannot change

1715
06:14:58,229 --> 06:15:09,720
do we have to fight over the robots in a way in a matter of speaking yes in a matter of speaking

1716
06:15:09,720 --> 06:15:29,139
yes for control you know what i'm saying i'm prepared i'm prepared but let's go back what

1806
06:30:02,330 --> 06:30:07,500
dollars appreciate that dork cube thanks for the 250 what do you think the lady behind the

1807
06:30:07,500 --> 06:30:14,139
walgreens photo counter would say if you asked to have a board of 985 pictures of yourself blown up

1808
06:30:14,139 --> 06:30:21,139
so you could hang it on your wall well i don't think that's uh necessarily strange what would

1809
06:30:21,139 --> 06:30:29,299
be strange is the subject matter of all of those photos because let's say i was doing a thing

1810
06:30:29,860 --> 06:30:36,099
where hey this is me this is all my baby pictures all the way through when i was two into when i

1811
06:30:36,099 --> 06:30:40,500
was five here's my first day of school here's to me and my friends and you have hundreds of

1812
06:30:40,500 --> 06:30:47,130
pictures like a collage of your whole life people do that the only difference is this is scary

1813
06:30:47,130 --> 06:30:54,970
pictures of me manipulated to make me look as scary as possible all over the last same time

1814
06:30:54,970 --> 06:31:03,930
period i think that they would be more curious and concerned about that than the amount of pictures

1815
06:31:08,939 --> 06:31:17,400
but no probably i don't know maybe they wouldn't say anything but thanks to the 250 dork cube thank

1816
06:31:17,400 --> 06:31:22,759
you gnarly for the 250 fun stream tonight if that blueberry germa face doesn't become an emote i'll
