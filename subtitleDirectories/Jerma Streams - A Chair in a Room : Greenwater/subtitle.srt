1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:07,660
All right, I'm just setting up the other game and wiping the lenses.

2
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,589
Cool. All right, this is called a chair in a room green water. I guess there's a chair in a room and

3
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:33,609
you have to investigate it. We'll see. There's more stuff in the exorcist game? Oh, oh well,

4
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:51,369
uh, maybe it's too late. All right, coming back. Here it is. Do the thing. Oh wait, hold on. I'm

5
00:00:51,369 --> 00:01:01,479
gonna make sure I can see what you guys are saying. We're good. Draw two. All right. No,

6
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,769
relax. Here we go. This is called a chair. Okay, at some point this fell out again. I'm not even

7
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:18,760
gonna use it. I don't even care. That's like the nose guard. The camera looks weird too, doesn't

8
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:31,030
it? Don't you think? What's going on here? Hold on. It looks fucking crazy. The white balance is

9
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:48,099
wrong. There's a contrast. It's like all fucked up. Why does it look so fucking weird? I feel

10
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:54,469
like I'm, I feel like I'm stop motion. Like I'm 12, I'm like 21 frames a second or something. It's

11
00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:09,139
weird. Don't you feel like I'm like, I've been animated? What happened? This is not at 60 fps.

12
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:21,689
Whatever. Don't worry. It's, it's, it's a chair in the room. Let's go. Would you have a 30 hertz

13
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,599
monitor? I don't have a 30 hertz monitor. I have a 120 hertz monitor. I need to upgrade. I have

14
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,840
1080 at 120 hertz. Intel, uh, six core processor. Don't worry. I'm gonna get one of those AMD

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:53,430
Rippers. I'm going back in. See you guys in a little bit. It's massive. Thanks, man.

16
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:12,169
Harris Michael, I hired you as a priest a couple weeks ago. You said this. All right. Here in the

17
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:47,639
room. Oh, Dr. Green? I judge how good a VR game is based on what is breakable in the room. And

18
00:03:47,639 --> 00:04:12,840
there we go. Ladies and gentlemen, this is at least one letter grade. How do you do it? E,

19
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:28,439
E, F, P, T. Oh, I'm covering your eye. Sorry. E, F, P, O, Z, L, F, E, D, F, E, C, F, D, E, D,

20
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:47,019

21
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:55,899
you might have. Oh, shit. Hey, uh, is leather jacket here? Leather jacket, are you here?

22
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,519
Oh, change the game to a green room. Whatever. Chair in a room. Thank you.

23
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:53,129
Oh, sir. Chair in a room. Just a chair in a room. Who's in that chair? Me. It's all you yourself.

24
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:04,550
Who's in that room? Ah, probably me in that chair. I don't know.

25
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:19,660
I was a bad Tommy Wiseau. I can't hear. My ears are blocked. If I could hear myself, I would do a

26
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:31,610
sick Tommy Wiseau impression. It was better than the last one. What do you mean credits? What are

27
00:06:31,610 --> 00:07:21,829
you talking about? Hey, fuck you, bitch. I lost the chair part of the room. Oh, swan.

28
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:41,399
Screwdriver. Box. Boy. Medication. Knife. Was I supposed to be repeating? Me. Head. Baby.

29
00:07:42,120 --> 00:08:03,910
Look at me. Priest. Phone. Sega. Pegasus. Sega. The Sega Pegasus. What? What? Why?

30
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:19,240
Uh, I was, I woke up and I, I ended up here. You guys, I have no idea. I thought I was coming

31
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:32,740
for a checkup and you guys put me in here. Separate maybe a little. Yes, ma'am. Uh, Otto,

32
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,500
what are you doing? Patient six zero seven nine. Please come to the window for your medication.

33
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:52,120
Otto just like walked over here. Don't come over here. Good boy. Okay. Uh, medication. Right. Um,

36
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:41,700
is a ball and three cups. Yeah, is it? I would like you to. It's a power move. What did I have

37
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:49,750
to do? Hide the cup, hide the ball under a cup? Sure. Good luck with this one, you piece of shit.

38
00:09:50,629 --> 00:10:04,230
Well, I got a new ball. Can I get a new ball, please? Can I get a new ball, please? You fucking

39
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,480
bastard scientist. You can't keep me in here. You think you can keep me in here? You're not

40
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,980
going to keep me in here. Let me the fuck out of here. I thought this was a DMV.

41
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:29,049
You want to play your little game. That's what you want. You want to play your little game.

42
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:50,519
You sicko. I seriously have another ball. I air. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here it is.

00:10:51,320 --> 00:11:01,370
Oh, I am going to hide this for you. Sure. Hey, Dr. Dickhead under the right one under the right

44
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:24,120

45
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:32,570
right one. Ah, that's a spider under there. Now. I turn my back, you put a spider under there. It's

46
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:47,960
kind of weird that you did that. I'll show it to you here. Spider. Pretty shitty trick. This is a

47
00:11:47,960 --> 00:12:02,870
This is a prop table. Thanks. Any more? Any more? Any more rain busters for me? What do you want

48
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:41,129
to do with this? It's a spider. It's a spider. It's a spider. It's a spider. Okay, I see I see a

49
00:12:41,129 --> 00:13:06,519
spider. Hello. I'm leaving. It was weird. Spider. Okay, spider here. Ball here. Brown like this.

50
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:24,919
Oh, shit. Give me that. Give it back. Can't get me in here. What the heck is this supposed to mean?

51
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:49,590
Bond fishing, huh? Are you gonna give me food or something? Change the you change the color

52
00:13:49,590 --> 00:14:22,700
of the thing that I have here. Um, I don't what do you want me to do? Bottoms up. How does that look?

53
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:40,600
Not taking it. I can't even see where it is if I wanted to take it in the first place.

54
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:48,629
Oh, my eyes are all blurry. I don't know you like. Do you have like an antihistamine I can take?

55
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,350
I'll take that. But I don't want to take whatever weird drug you just gave me.

56
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:09,740
Uh, I need some other drug. All right. Fine. Where is it? I can hear. Where is it? Okay. All

57
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:23,100
right. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. You can go back to your room now. Do I eat the

58
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:47,559
spider? I hate the spider. The drugs. I didn't want to take those drugs. I can't look at this

59
00:15:47,559 --> 00:16:25,509
room. I can't turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Oh, please recalibrate the shit. What's

60
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:43,210
going on here? Okay. This room looks normal. All of the information. All right. How do I start?

61
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,590
Are you ready for your point to start? I want to start a new game. Make your way upstairs.

62
00:16:50,470 --> 00:17:08,519
Afters? I want to start a new game. I don't know. Maybe it'll just work. Will it just happen?

63
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:25,000
This is fucked up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do that.

64
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:42,940
Walk into a wall. What happened? Why can I not start what I left off? There's got to be a way

65
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:50,579
to do that. It's got to be like a load game or something, right? Load game, load game,

66
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:59,670
but not start a new game. What does that one do? Aim. Please be comfortable. This room contains

67
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,230
all of the information you need to get ready for your point to be dropped to green. Oh, wait.

68
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:45,079
Let's photograph. Ready to start upstairs. Photograph and then grab the handle. Point?

69
00:18:47,619 --> 00:19:11,779
There is only grip. What do you mean, point? Okay. This looks more like what was supposed

70
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:36,390
to happen, I guess. For my toys. What does this say? I need to go to my desk.

71
00:19:37,509 --> 00:20:01,609
The Winter. Oscar Charrington. The Holy Bible. By Oscar Charrington. No, we're going to hotel,

72
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:15,339
we're going to hotel room this thing. There. Don't open that drawer for like 30 years. The bed?

73
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:32,440
Sleep? Ah, dude, another classic by fucking Oscar Charrington. Paradise Lost. A poem written in

74
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:59,269
10 books. Oscar Charrington. What time does that say? That is 1202. I am a murderer. Who did I kill?

75
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:11,380
What? I'm a murderer. Who did I kill? I am a murderer. Who did I kill? I remember a bird on

76
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:20,420
the water. What was that? Place the clue here. I wonder. Bird on the water. That sounds to me

77
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:38,940
like a duck. This is everything I can remember. I have to hide what I know. The doctors say that

78
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,740
memories haunt me so I hide this from them. Things here seem familiar, they must be. Right there.

79
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:55,049
Well. Oh, that's, this is, this is, that's a vulture.

80
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,559
Yeah, that's some good, that's some good shit, apparently.

81
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:23,160
Carry items between rooms. That was chapter one already. Chapter two, let's go. Oh, it's just,

82
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:35,849
I love that. I love it. I'm gonna do it. Oh, we are just too wild and crazy, guys.

83
00:22:35,849 --> 00:23:00,440
What? I can't make that wrap. That's a huge alligator, by the way. Let's be real.

84
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:25,740
Power lamp. What's a power lamp? Operate, hold flashlight in hand and press thumb pad.

85
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:45,779
Oh, can I fish? Power lamp. Oh, press, there we go.

86
00:23:46,660 --> 00:24:15,930
Well, that's not safe. I think so, boy. Okay, um, now what? I think I might have needed that.

87
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:34,140
Nice. Now, all right, what do I do? Check all the draws?

88
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:57,220
Add debt but still want the dream lifestyle you deserve? Unlock your, unlock your potential

89
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:29,049
mortgage refinance. No application. Live the dream. Oh, there's a, there's a, there's a monster

90
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:44,920
in there. There's a fucking monster. Did you see that? That's horrible. I swear to God,

91
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:59,319
there was a monster in there. Something in this. Can I like, screw drive his eye out?

92
00:26:00,519 --> 00:27:00,250
Get that there. Um, E, S, E. How do I get out of here? Driver. Oh, shit, I got it.

93
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:15,779
That's what I saw. Where? Okay, uh, take these planks off.

94
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:40,700
All right, I need the light. This. Indeed. Indeed, say. Party's welcome. Regeneration.

95
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:55,619
The locals feel abandoned. What else is in there? Why? Just didn't feel like having anything in there.

96
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:48,809
Oh, there's something in that bag. What the fuck is in this bag? What happened? Pizza box?

97
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:25,740
This is a huge pizza thing to break that with. Oh, off the walk. I get in here. I leave this room?

98
00:29:26,299 --> 00:30:01,930
I can leave this room. Bounce. I bring this with me into the room? Like this. Can I open that?

99
00:30:01,930 --> 00:31:00,539
Turn on the lamp. 8.7k Andy. That's great. What happened to the lamp? It looks like Otto. Um,

100
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:20,650
it's so stupid. Where's the lamp? Why does it fucking disappear? Where's the lamp?

101
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:36,180
Lamp find lamp. Search for the lamp. Where's the lamp? Where's the lamp? At the lamp?

102
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:52,250
Where is the fucking lamp? Tuck in the wall in the first room. Fuck, come on.

103
00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:07,779
Well, now I'm stuck in the wall. Stuck in the wall in the first room.

104
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:21,769
What's going on? Am I going crazy or what?

105
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:53,289
I'm fucking mad at this game now. Now I'm angry. Now you pissed me off. Now you made me angry. Now

106
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:59,579
you got me irritated. I'm searching around for a fucking lamp and I'm stuck in the wall now.

107
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:23,779
I don't think it's even here anymore. Just turn it off. Just turn it off. What button did I press

108
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:33,930
on the side? Why does this button exist by the way? Why would you put this button here? The button

109
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:48,150
that you like never find again. It's gone. I have to restart the whole thing. Am I losing my fucking

110
00:33:48,150 --> 00:34:08,420
mind or is it just gone? Did I like throw it over here? Do I like, do I even need it? I'm giving

111
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:26,090
this 30 more seconds before I just delete it and uninstall again. Hey, so you're saying it's in this

112
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:48,710
room? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's in here? I'm ready for my medicine. Can I take it please?

113
00:34:49,429 --> 00:35:20,340
Light illuminating the wall. I think you're in the corner. It's really hard to see.

114
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:46,150
Here. You're talking about like in here. What happened? Give me his back. I thought that was

115
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:51,190
an eyeball. All right. All right. All right. Okay. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

116
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:11,380
Wait, can I go? What might be in this corner? Is it because I like the ruin? I like the ruin,

117
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,340
right? I was like, oh, there it goes. And then it got like lodged in the wall.

118
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:59,610
In this wall, technically, right? Shut up and let me in. End of the circle. Detail of the game.

119
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,110
Hey dude, it started up. It was so promising when it started out though.

120
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:28,409
I'm not, I'm never letting go of this. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Go. Go.

121
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:33,659
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. That falls. It'll fall down in two seconds. Ready? Three, two, one. There it goes.

122
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:41,429
It falls down. I take a look over here. You read the postcard. Isn't that interesting?

123
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:50,420
Isn't that interesting? Okay. Isn't that interesting? Okay. Wow. Isn't that interesting?

124
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,250
Look at this. That's interesting. All interesting stuff. What's in here? Isn't that interesting?

125
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:01,449
What's this thing say? Holy shit. What's that say? Isn't that interesting? Okay. Cool. Cool. All right.

126
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:26,469
Drop. Drop that. There it goes. Okay. Drop. I thought that was outside of my window.

127
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:44,650
Oh, it was. I think somebody's just out there. Okay. Oh. There. I can't stop moving. Why am I moving?

128
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:54,860
Okay. Who cares? Open the door. What's in there? There's a scary monster. Open.

129
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:16,389
Open. Okay. Here we go. Hey. Remember that song? That thing moves. Three, two, one. Scary.

130
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:28,940
And this don't open. What do we do about that? Can I use the saw on that? Oh, dude. Oh, shit.

131
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:34,550
Man, what the heck? How do I get out of this? We open up this and see what's in here.

132
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:44,570
Oh, this means something maybe. Oh, authorities say that the plant got shut down. What the fuck,

133
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,489
dude? What the hell's going on in this town? What else is in here? That broke off.

134
00:39:49,530 --> 00:40:05,139
Heck. Oh, something's moving in that bag. There. Who's in that? Oh. Beware. Beware. I didn't even

135
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:21,190
see that. I didn't have the lamp. Let's go. All right. What do I do with this?

136
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:31,539
Pry this off. What should I do with this? Pry the boards off. Okay. Here we go.

137
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:57,539
Pry those boards off. Let's work with the floor. There it is. And I can't grab it. I can't grab it.

138
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:21,079
Get in there. Come on. Get in there. Get out. Okay. It's blown. A couple of bones.

139
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:34,760
Otto, I'm not playing right now. He's like, I'm down here and he's like trying to play with me.

140
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:44,940
Otto. Hold on. All right. Wait. Hold on. I don't want to step on him. Give me one second.

141
00:41:45,500 --> 00:42:11,380
You want to go out? Come here. Okay. I have to give this like five to 10 more minutes.

142
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:27,099
My back is going to explode. Getting kicked out of the room. Like every time I go this way,

143
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:40,340
it's like... Okay, here we go. Back to that like hospital. Nothing in there. I have probably

144
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:51,159
to go fishing. I'm going to say like go fishing. Right? Like that's a fishing pole.

145
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:57,380
Otto, we're going to scoop it out with this. Don't delete the... I left it way up there.

146
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:54,869
I need to get that fishing rod. There it goes. Oh. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What is it?

147
00:43:54,869 --> 00:44:18,119
There's a key in here. Key. Oh my god. Yes. All right. We're good. All right. 10 more minutes.

148
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,989
10 more minutes. I promise, mom. I'll do my homework in 10 minutes.

149
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:33,590
All right. The game just got way better. I was very mean to this game. It just got way better.

150
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,829
We're going to get a residency before it by that crocodile.

151
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:19,239
There she blows. Where is it? I lie down on my back. It can't get me.

152
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:29,750
Wait, do I have to steer this? I thought that was just the motor.

153
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:58,969
Oh, it's a big swan. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

154
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:42,820
Hey. Well, I'm going to sit down and enjoy myself. Am I supposed to be doing something?

155
00:46:44,099 --> 00:47:32,199
What's that? Look, those are birds over there flying around. What's happening? Did I miss something?

156
00:47:44,329 --> 00:48:05,559
Mommy, I saw something in the water. No. No. Don't even think about it. Get out of here.

157
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:40,340
Watch that tail. He's going to smash underneath us. Hey, don't do that. What a trip, Hank.

158
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:51,860
Let's go out. It's a little foggy. Don't worry about it. Okay. I'm cold. It's foggy.

159
00:48:52,500 --> 00:49:02,409
We can't see anything. You want to fish out here? God darn it. Worst trip I've ever taken. Hank,

160
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:36,730
what's that? POV. You're on a murder date. Wait for the drop. It's right there.

161
00:49:51,670 --> 00:50:16,550
Was that Seaman? That was Seaman. What was that? Seaman 2. I'll be honest. That was a very,

162
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:25,300
very, very, very, very, very long boat ride. The allocator did not fucking knock it over.

163
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:32,250
You know what I mean? He did get a Seaman reveal, though, which was pretty awesome.

164
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:54,869
Okay. Let's go to bed now, right? Go to bed. I want to do more in the medical place,

165
00:50:54,869 --> 00:51:02,150
but she's telling me to do things. That was so cool. A teenager in the water. Who else was out

166
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:13,619
there? What was that bird in the highway? Bird on the highway. Highway bird. No, not a highway bird.

167
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:26,489
Highway bird. That kind of looks like a highway bird. No, that's not a highway bird. This is a

168
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:50,070
highway bird. We're in a motel. This might get interesting. That boat ride with that leg. Here

169
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:57,429
it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.

170
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:04,170
Here it comes. This face in the water. All right. This is getting a little creepy.

171
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,650
All right. This is already way scarier than riding on the Disney boat.

172
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:19,050
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Stop. Stop. Stop. I don't want to do that.

173
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:28,059
Look, I get it. You're trying to watch the porn channel. It's not going to come through. I tried

174
00:52:28,059 --> 00:53:05,320
everything already. I'm sorry. I remember what? Meet me tomorrow morning? I think the mic just

175
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:36,940
picked up her just ripping a huge one. I remember George. Meet her tomorrow morning. Oh, this is

176
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:46,500
crazy. Why would you just be taking pills at the bottom of the ocean?

177
00:53:49,610 --> 00:54:24,500
Oh, this is creepy. What kind of bed is this? A weird bed? It's not long enough. What's weird

178
00:54:24,500 --> 00:55:00,170
about this? Why? It's like a big marshmallow bed. Morning yet? Where the hell am I?

179
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:08,650
Like in Motel, no fake. Where am I? Like the dream reality is like shifting around.

180
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:34,579
King size beds. Can I open this? Can I open this? Uh, pills in here. Oh, take the pills.

181
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:56,260
Take them. All right. I took more of them. Oh, that's, I hate that.

182
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:22,730
Okay, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. Oh, it's the duck. It's the duck.

183
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:41,000
It's the scariest fucking monster we've seen all night. Oh, shit. Okay. Go out, out, out, out,

184
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,480
out of the room. Out of the room. Out of the room. We can go, we can leave, right? We can get the

185
00:56:45,480 --> 00:57:09,059
fuck out of here, right? He's going to be in my face. I thought it was really going to be this

186
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:26,150
one, like chasing us. I feel really fucked up. I'm going to be really honest with you.

187
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:36,710
This is what it feels like when you're shit faced. I, this is, this is, who made this game?

188
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:41,849
You've got to give this to like people to like, to like, this is like an education. This is

189
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:56,699
educational. Like this is fucked up. All right, get out. This is, this is some, this is exactly

190
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:06,900
what it's like. You nailed it. You nailed it. God damn it. Another hallway. It's coming. Here

191
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:30,070
comes the swan again. I'm going to turn around. I'm going to see a swan behind me. Oh, I'm out

192
00:58:30,070 --> 00:59:18,090
of bounds. Okay. Oh shit. There's drugs in there. I think. I don't know.

193
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,760
But a police spokesperson has confirmed that the victim suffered multiple injuries and it is still

194
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,159
unclear if the victim drowned in the swamp or if he was killed before entering the water.

195
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:54,940
Okay. Police are investigating an unusual theme park swan boat, which was found close to the

196
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,059
victim's body. I think it might've been the killer. Information about a figure seen using the boat in

197
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:04,940
the early hours. Swan boat was seen fleeing the crime scene on the surveillance video of the

198
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:15,400
amusement park. Bring some booze with those pills.

199
01:00:45,559 --> 01:01:21,300
That's scary. Oh shit. Oh, uh, mommy and daddy are on a vacation right now.

200
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,820
Fuck. Who are you? Was that me in the, was that me or them?

201
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:38,500
We're at the Pelican Motel now. We need to check out at the end of that road.

202
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,780
Now make sure that no one tries to slip away. Officer, I'm in here.

203
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:58,010
Officer. Officer. Officer. I'm in this room. Officer. I'll break this fucking thing if I have to.

204
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:09,860
Oh, he's talking, he's talking to me. Leave the room. This is dangerous.

205
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:51,239
Oh, safe. Road safe. Don't suffer alone. Code for the safe. What are you getting that from?

206
01:02:51,239 --> 01:03:32,940
There might be a code in here. Ah, eight, four, five, six, seven, five. But I remember I've

207
01:03:32,940 --> 01:05:01,750
write down. Oh, dough. I can't read it. Oh, seven, nine. Is that right? I really can't read it.

208
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:20,889
Six, two, seven. Is it six, two, seven, nine? Fucking do it. Six, two, seven, nine.

209
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:37,769
Wrong code. Officer, do you know what the, what the code is for all the safes?

210
01:05:38,489 --> 01:07:04,260
What do you see? Key digits. Digits. Not four. Oh, that's easy. Postcard. Oh, postcard. Why is

211
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:37,900
it doing a creepy sound like? Ace of a safe shell. Oh, right. I heard it there. Greetings from New

212
01:07:37,900 --> 01:08:18,739
Orleans. What's going on here? Bitch. Eight, four, three. Eight, four, three is the only three digit

213
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:33,109
number up here. Wait, why is the bathroom locked from the inside? I don't know. Eight, four, three.

214
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:38,069
Go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. I can't. It's locked from the inside.

215
01:08:38,789 --> 01:09:09,289
Hear him? All right, I'm gonna do eight, four, three. God, give me a fucking break. Fork in, outlet.

216
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:21,779
Don't say that. Fork in, outlet. Where's that fork? All right, maybe can I break,

217
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:38,420
I can break the door open? Okay, it keeps, it's playing a sound. I'm looking for three digit codes,

218
01:09:38,420 --> 01:10:15,420
like an asshole. Hugs. Always take them immediately. What does that do for me?

219
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:33,109
No writing on the bathroom wall or anything. Writing on this? Or pro-mav-zine? Or pro-ma-zine?

220
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:59,000
Three, two, three, two, eight. Three, two, zero. Let's go, buddy. I cannot leave.

221
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,819
Somebody in the bathtub. Somebody in the bathtub. Somebody in the bathtub. I knew there was a

222
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:38,539
little person there. Grade 20. Oh, give it to me. Is. Hey, I need the, what's the flashlight?

223
01:11:51,130 --> 01:12:13,140
Puzzle, okay? I need the, I need the next piece. Bible. I'm gonna open that. Wait for me in the

224
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:40,630
lodge. Wait for me in the lodge. All right, I will. I have to look in the Bible. Wait for me in the

225
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:46,600
lodge. All right, let's go. Get that chair out of the way. The cops aren't there anymore.

226
01:12:54,300 --> 01:13:25,060
Hide the page in the Bible. Actually, pretty brilliant. And wait for you in the lodge.

227
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:37,289
We know you're in there. Me? You better come out, buddy. Whatever doesn't kill you

228
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:48,060
makes you a stranger. Three. I thought I was gonna count to three. Wait, don't you come in on three?

229
01:13:49,180 --> 01:14:27,350
The dead guy give me the Bible. Why the lodge? Why me? It was a bird. One who preys on the

230
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:31,739
weakness of others. Birds. All right, I'm gonna get this five more minutes.

231
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:46,090
Five more minutes. All right, that last chapter was actually really good.

232
01:14:46,890 --> 01:15:03,260
That was very good. That was terrifying. That was very good. There are hints on your hand behind

233
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:23,239
that. Really? The eyes. The hips. Like a hip MRI. That is bird lungs.

234
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:49,779
Oh, that's a huge chair. That chair looks like it's made out of... This is like a human chair.

235
01:15:50,899 --> 01:16:07,619
It looks like it's made out of blood. That's a normal chair. That's kind of... That's a weird

236
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:19,689
chair. That's weird. I don't like those. It's a weird chair, isn't it? It's a scary chair to me.

237
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:31,579
Literally a chair. I feel like if I was... I'd be scared of that chair. It looks like it's gonna

238
01:16:31,579 --> 01:16:37,130
have knives shoot out of those little holes and like a shot through my back. Oh, what the

239
01:16:37,130 --> 01:17:33,180
fuck? Are you kidding me, dude? Are you serious? Nice. Good. Oh. Like it. Don't like it. Oh.

240
01:17:33,180 --> 01:18:06,600
Careful. There's a desk there. Excuse me. What are you doing? That's it. At least. When I just

241
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:14,310
bent... I guess not. I'm having like too much fun, but VR... I can't stream VR for more than five

242
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:35,100
hours, so I can't. All right. One minute. One more minute. VR is so much fun. It's just impossible

243
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:49,699
to do. I'm gonna take a bath. Don't worry. Get down here. Oh, nice degree.

244
01:18:50,500 --> 01:19:10,710
Oh, look. It's so prestigious. Eastern Teaching Hospital. Wow. You're smarter than me because

245
01:19:10,710 --> 01:20:15,699
you're a doctor. Oh, no. It's a face. Eyes. Moustache. Mouth. How did you get in here?

246
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:55,350
Where is he? What am I supposed to do? Are you gonna come down here?

247
01:20:55,989 --> 01:21:07,859
Should I come down here and say something about it? That says something. I need a lamp.

248
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:26,229
That says something back there. It's written up there.

249
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:10,859
This was fun, but I gotta stop before I die. Postcard on the desk will pick up on it on

250
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:17,319
Halloween night. This is a lot of fun, though. All right. I'll give you my verdict. Chapter one

251
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:23,239
was awesome. Chapter two was not good at all. Chapter three was incredible. Chapter four,

252
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:29,800
we don't know yet. We don't know yet. Hey, I'll give you a hold on a minute for this one.

253
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:44,100
The Exorcist was awesome. That was really good. Really good. Dip five marshmallows in water and

254
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:58,069
then do what? What do you want me to do? Otto? Otto's gone. He wanted to go up. All right. Here's

255
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:05,640
the plan. Oh, thank you for joining me tonight. That was very, very fun. Very scary. I lost

256
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,399
probably a little bit of a little bit of time left in the end of my life because of all the screaming.

257
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:18,600
Exorcist was fucking crazy. Anyways, next stream is going to be Watch Dogs Legion. I'm going to

258
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:25,779
play it at lunch. I'm probably only going to play for one day, but I mean, I've been, it could,

259
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:30,979
there's potential that it could be at least fun to play for like four or five hours.

260
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:35,979
Is it sponsored? No. Trust me. Don't worry. I'll like swear about the game a thousand times.

261
01:23:35,979 --> 01:23:39,140
Trust me. I'm probably going to tell you the game's terrible. I'll play the game for like

262
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:48,699
four hours and go, this game's fucking awful. I hate this. I don't know. No, it's not a sponsored

263
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:54,739
stream. It's not. I just want to look, I'll be honest. I want to play as the old lady and

264
01:23:54,739 --> 01:23:59,369
strangle somebody and then this room will be over. I'm just going to have a team of old ladies.

265
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:03,210
Everybody that's on my team is going to be over the age of like 70 and we're just going to strangle

266
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:11,399
people and I'll do like four missions. I got what I wanted out of it. And then after that,

267
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:15,720
we're going to play Little Hope with Italics and Italics is going to do a co-op stream.

268
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:22,279
Last time me and Italics played, we did Man of Medan. So fast forward like a year and we're

269
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:27,960
going to do Little Hope now. And then Halloween night, we're going back in here and I'm going to

270
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:34,140
do more of this shit on Halloween night. It'll be fun. So you won't see me for the next two days

271
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:44,739
and then we'll go bang, bang, bang three days in a row. Are you Brad? Let's see. I am wiped out

272
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:50,550
though. I'm fucking tired. I'll, uh, I'll see you guys in a couple of days. I'm going to actually

273
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:57,289
crouch down here. It's a shit load of people here. I didn't even look at like the view count.

274
01:24:57,289 --> 01:25:07,350
I thought you guys were just saying like 9k, 10k Andy again. Man, there's a, you back there. You

275
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:11,670
back there. I saw what you just did. You think you can hide that from me? I saw what you just did.

276
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:16,359
I think I can't fucking notice that. Well, now you're a 7k. Well, the stream's over. People

277
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:22,710
leaving. Uh, yeah, I'll see you guys a couple of days. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs.

278
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:29,220
We're going to show them right now. Here they come. Let's go over and see if any of the, anything

279
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:42,729
major, uh, sub or donation wise happened because I can't really see them. Take a look. I'm going

280
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:53,479
to wait here staring at the screen for two days. I think that might not be a great idea. That's

281
01:25:53,479 --> 01:25:59,640
what I do. Uh, we had the 10 community subs from Princess Hotcakes and then five from Nidhogg

282
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:08,119
from Nidhogg Man. Thank you both of you. That rounds out the community subs for today.

283
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:24,979
No, I'm not streaming till Halloween. No, no, no. I'm streaming Watch Dogs Legion when it comes out.

284
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:30,020
Even just kneeling down like this. I put my knees on the ground and I'm just leaning forward.

285
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:43,130
I'm like about to break in half. Let me lean back for a sec. Oh, god damn it. What happened to me?

286
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:54,819
What actually happened? I have no idea. I'm still on it. I'm still punching at it. Grab a chair. No,

287
01:26:54,819 --> 01:27:01,899
I'm okay. I'm okay. Otto didn't do anything wrong. No, he didn't. He's a good boy.

288
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:41,319
Raid Ross. Uh, sure. What's he doing? No, not Ross from Friends. What? Ross from Friends.

289
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:55,500
All right, we're gonna go say hi. We'll go, uh, go tell Ross hello. Rubber ninja. We played Fa-

290
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:00,300
you know, maybe we'll play Phasmophobia again soon. I mean, it's Halloween. Maybe we'll try

291
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:08,470
to get like a Halloween Phasmophobia thing again. That'd be cool. All right, go tell Ross I said

292
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:13,430
hello. They're playing Super Mario Maker 2. They're, uh, I believe he's making levels.

293
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:21,420
He's doing level fixing. Let's find out. I will see you guys in a couple of days. Have a great rest

294
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:28,729
of your night. Goodbye. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around as always. Take care. See you soon.
