1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,119
What the hell are you doing? You dropped your burger on the ground there.

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,119
You dropped your burger on the ground.

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,120
Hey, have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Bros. 2?

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,230
It's pretty cool. You see the main character, Super Mario, he goes like this.

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,230
And he gets into the... where's the game?

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,230
That doesn't even hurt. That doesn't even hurt.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,609
Where's the gun?

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,679
Give me that gun.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,240
Give me this gun. Give me that gun. I win.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,240
You really like this joke.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
You got me.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Today is your unlucky day, motherfucker.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,380
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha, motherfucker.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,939
I don't think that's going to stop being funny.

15
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:02,750
What's wrong? Having some trouble? Come on now. What do you got?

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,750
You got a pistol. I got a pistol. I'm going to shoot you with this pistol.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Duck. Jump.

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,810
Get wrecked. I mean, get wrecked.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,840
It's actually kind of hard. It's hard to hit B and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,450
Watch out. I got a shotgun. I got one too. I'm going to blast you.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,750
You going to blast me? I'm going to throw it.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,750
You think you're going to blast me?

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,750
Well, I'm not going to now. I don't have a shotgun anymore.

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,629
Come chase me.

25
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,189
What?

26
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,189
Come chase me?

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,189
I don't know. Come chase me.

28
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,189
You're the one with the gun. Chase me.

29
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,819
We're going to do it just like they used to do in the old times.

30
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,989
Back to back. Ten paces.

31
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,939
Turn around. Okay.

32
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,120
In ten paces. Go.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,540
Die.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,739
Miscalculation.

36
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,980
My die was like eight syllables.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,330
That's the fucking Earthworm. I just found the Earthworm gym gun, dude.

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,330
Dude, look. Look. Look. This is the gun from Earthworm gym.

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,270
Cool, huh? Cool.

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,270
Duck Game. On Steam. Currently part of the Steam sale.

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,270
Pick it up today. You're going to have fun with all your friends.

42
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,960
Like this guy. He's my friend. But is he really though? I don't know. Could he be? I have no idea.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Friends. I love friends.

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,960
This whole thing. This whole thing sucks.

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:39,009
You know, when I sit up here and stare at this red beam, I think about my life and where I've been and where I'll go.

46
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:45,330
And what? Aliens. Are we the aliens to aliens?

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I just want to watch the world burn.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,139
That's a Batman quote.

49
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,340
I wonder how long this recording has been.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,189
Hello there. Welcome to the shoe shop.

51
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,430
Okay, so I have this pair of shoes for only $12.

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,460
I'll take them.

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
Okay, good.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,580
Yes, my old nemesis. The hamburger head. Those of you that know who he is.

55
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,889
He's a dastardly villain. And he must be destroyed.

56
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,770
We have to come down here.

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,259
Yeah, I know. I will eventually. I'm doing my monologue.

58
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:35,830
It's incredibly important to the story arc of my character.

59
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,259
I seriously don't know how many more of these I can even tolerate as a person.

60
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,259
That's the moon gun.

61
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,259
I'm going to catch it in my mouth.

62
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:47,270
No, no, don't die.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,560
There he is. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the guy that had my character.

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
I have to go to kill that guy. It's part of my character storyline.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,939
Bastard.

66
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,500
All right, so your first day on a job here at Edwards Construction.

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You got to be careful.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,839
Told you to be careful.

69
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,839
And that's when she told me to go to school.

70
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,839
She wanted to see me.

71
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,839
Well, you're really fucking this up, aren't you?

72
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,149
Are we the aliens to that planet?

73
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,399
Could be. Makes sense, in my opinion.

74
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,069
Although a more existential way to look at it is probably like this.

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:55,610
Can you believe Carol? Carol in accounting.

76
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,610
Man, she really gave me the ride.

77
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,490
I have to get back to work.

78
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,790
Yeah, you do. I don't know why you've been doing that.

79
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,579
Seems kind of expensive.

80
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,879
All right, I'm ready.

81
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:24,759
Okay, I'm going to catch it in my mouth.

82
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,560
Hey, I just want to say congratulations on being number one.

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
You don't talk to me.

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
You deserve that trophy.

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
You're second place. I win.
