1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,629
What? I'm trying to... I'm trying to do the thing. I'm trying to be a streamer. I'm trying to be a

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:16,629
streamer that has an intro play from one to a minute. We talked about this like a few days ago.

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:27,559
I'm trying to... All right, listen to me. Everybody that you watch on Twitch, I want... you know,

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:35,460
I want to get like an assessment, you know? What's the average starting soon screen time? I'm curious.

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:48,250
This is... no, this is important. What? 15 minutes? 15 minutes? Okay. I'm seeing a lot of 15 minutes.

6
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:57,929
10 minutes? 20 minutes? It's like 10 to 20 minutes? Okay. Zero minutes to an hour.

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:14,359
Pre-stream chat is that for you? Well, my question is, so if I'm late by 10 to 20 minutes,

8
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,030
at half the streams, aren't I just starting when most people would start usually after

9
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:35,349
a starting soon screen? Thinking phase, you know? No, because you don't wait for the notifications.

10
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,040
Oh, shit. Am I right? You're right. No, you're right. No, I had to take it on the phone. All right,

11
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,200
so the last couple days, I've had phone calls that have come in that are just like,

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,920
well, you have to answer this or your life is gonna fuck up. Oh, okay. I'm gonna answer that

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:10,379
phone call. I've had like two answer this or else phone calls in the last two days. No, it's not a

14
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:25,240
scam caller. That'll sound like fake calls to me. Anyways, how you doing, guys? Welcome back. We're

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:37,030
gonna play Black and White again, as you see on the title and from the tweet. Where we left it

16
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:46,680
last night is an actually pretty sad spot. Not a nice spot. Our new cow friend who we made last

17
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,669
night, the cow's name, by the way, is Murius. If you were not part of the pre-stream chat,

18
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:09,879
he's curious, he's a little furious, and he's a cow. He's Murius. Furious Murius. You can also say

19
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:27,780
curious Murius when he's doing something that's not so mean. Mald and Murius. Minus two. Hype train

20
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,979
incoming. What the fuck was that? What was that? You will have a limited time to earn exclusive

21
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:46,500
emotes. What is this? What's going on? Hype train at 82%. What the fuck is this? Sub gift or use bits

22
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:56,889
to get to the next level. What? I don't know what this is. Is this new? 100% we did it, apparently.

23
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:06,680
Hooray. Hype. I don't know what that was. I didn't enable this. This is like a birthday part. Level

24
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:18,009
one complete. Level two hype train. Okay, what is this, Twitch? I don't, what, we have five

25
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:30,949
minutes to do this? This is so, this is so obvious. I don't know what the fuck this is. I swear to

26
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:41,079
God. I was like talking about my cow. Wait, hold on, people are just giving a shit load of subs right

27
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:53,779
now. What the fuck? Hold on. Hype train. Hype. What is going on? What do you mean level two complete?

28
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,279
How many levels are there? No, there's three, there's more than three levels?

29
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,220
Level three hype train. Can I, I can click this button? Completing level three requires

30
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,100
hype conductors. What the, what is a hype conductor? This is like a train conductor,

31
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:28,490
a current hype train tops level three emotes. Wait, you're unlocking emotes like these weird

32
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:38,220
train monsters? We just got to level five? What level are we? Okay, hold on. I can't even keep

33
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,470
up with how many people just subbing right now. All right, you got more emotes. Thanks for the hype

34
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,730
train. I don't know if we've been selected to test a new feature, but apparently we're testing it.

35
00:05:54,069 --> 00:06:06,069
Uh, level four hype train. Okay, at some point we have to get off of the train.

36
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:14,540
Sub gift. All right, let me see what this even is supposed to be for. Oh my God. All right,

37
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:26,250
guys, I, it never stops. No, it has to stop at some, you can't ride a train this fast.

38
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,459
75% level four. Oh man. Level wages. Dead. Level four hype train.

39
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:48,839
All right. All right. So now that's it, right? Now we can, did we do it? Level four complete.

40
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm going to look this, I'm going to look this up. Hold on.

41
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,259
Hype train Twitch. I feel like I'm going to get like a bunch of compilation videos.

42
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,430
Hype train guide. I can't fucking believe this is happening so close to

43
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,100
the new year's Eve stream. Hype train incoming. Hype train is a super size celebration when

44
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,329
community members unite to support a streamer that they love. Well, thank you guys. It challenges

45
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:37,339
the community to reach epic levels of hype and reward. But when did this start? Oh my fucking

46
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:47,819
God. This is like, you, you've Twitch, you've gamified hype meters now. Oh my God.

47
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,779
So many subs and bits are coming in. I can't even fucking comprehend. I can't even, I,

48
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:08,730
we got to go to the beginning here. I haven't even done an intro yet. Hype. You did it.

49
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,339
Level five. It has to stop somewhere. Look, what does it, what does it say?

50
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,290
What does it say for? All right. You did it. We did it. You did it. You did a level five hype train.

51
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:41,659
135%. There ain't going over this. 140. I mean, it doesn't stop. Well, there's three minutes.

52
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:55,539
150%. You guys are fucking crazy, man. Well, that's an interesting feature.

53
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:06,309
It just activates when, holy shit. You guys don't even have to do this. You already unlocked level

54
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:15,240
five. You got, you're at 175%. You don't even have to do this anymore. You've already, we've

55
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:25,769
hyped ourselves into, into outer space. You did it. I just wish it wasn't called hype train.

56
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:32,649
Cause it is like, it does the hype thing at the top. Can I customize that so it doesn't say hype?

57
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:45,639
Can it say, I don't even know. Almost 200%. Two minutes until this clock runs out and,

58
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:56,220
and I get subbed and gifted another two to 300 times. Thank you guys. I did not know this feature

59
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,179
was even coming through, but just remember, I'm going to be very clear about this. The ridiculous,

60
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:08,779
insane, like top 30 on Twitch in sub numbers, top 40 on Twitch in sub numbers. And

61
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:17,779
incoming money. I'm going to fucking use it. I'm going to use it for this stream. I promise you,

62
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:36,090
a million percent, 246% of this experimental feature. He's going to use it on cocaine.

63
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:44,220
I don't do drugs. If I pissed in the wee, I don't do drugs. It's a monumental task

64
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:56,889
for me to even thank any of you. I, it's so, it's, this is like, it has to be one of the most

65
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,570
generous supportive communities on Twitch. It has to be. I can't even begin to tell you how much I

66
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:15,940
can say thanks. Honest to God, it's, it has to be up in the top 20. It has to be. The hype train

67
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:34,039
is at 333%. Get it to 420. 400%. This is the shit you didn't even need to do. Here it comes.

68
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:46,460
The clock is running out at 350. Hype train success. Okay. Now there's the, such strong support.

69
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:56,539
Level five completed. Now what do you all get? 182 subs at 24,000 fucking bits. What in the name

70
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:08,059
of God? We're delivering emotes. You guys have emotes now? Great work. Emotes are being delivered

71
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:22,840
to supporters. Hype unicorn three. What even are these? Can I customize those? All right,

72
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:32,740
if I can customize those, I'm going to make them fucking, I can't, no. Make a hype cow.

73
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:43,690
Once again, everybody, I can't even, my brain has trouble with this shit because I can't even

74
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,799
fathom something like this happening. And I just want, I just want to have fun. I just want,

75
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,039
I just want us to have fun together as a group of people. I just want, that's it. That's all

76
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,720
I care about. You know what I mean? Like it's hard for me to even say thanks because I don't

77
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,679
even know what to fucking do. It's just like ridiculous. I hope you fucking have fun. I really

78
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:11,580
do. Let's, let's have some fun. Somebody gave 20, Furious Bear 20 subs. We're going to, there's

79
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,659
going to be a long outro tonight. I will tell you because there was a, there was $50 too. There's

80
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:32,860
like $50 like five times. Holy shit. Somebody gave 100, 200 where? AB Joe gave 5,000 bits. They

81
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:43,289
said keep going. That's, so how do you, how does that even happen? Is it just random? Well, Twitch,

82
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:52,100
if you just released this and you'd like to get some beta feedback, here it is. Like there you are.

83
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:02,549
You just got a bunch of it. But thank you, AB Joe 5,000. Oh my God. That's the loudest one of the

84
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,230
year. Clip that one. That has to be the lot. That's the loudest room that's ever happened.

85
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:17,980
Seriously, like I won't even need a category. That was next to the window. Fiddy, thanks for

86
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:26,500
the 5,000 bits. I'm pogging so hard right now. You guys are fucking too much. Well,

87
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:36,220
top fucking goddamn 40. Top 30. Let's go. Let's go. Let's, let's, let's, let's take this whole

88
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:44,379
fucking website over. You know what I mean? Let's go. Let's, let's, let's, let's do it.

89
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:51,289
You guys should get fucking hyped for this channel. You should fucking feel excited for it,

90
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:56,009
especially considering we're about to play black and white for like another eight hours.

91
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:12,169
Oh, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? No, but for real, for real, for real, for real.

92
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:21,179
Oh yeah. Here we go. Everybody. Let's go hype trade. Hype me up. German 985. Okay. I mean like

93
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:29,990
that's over here. What's that thing? Oh, that's a tree. I need more of those. Yeah. Put that over

94
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:41,370
Adam, Adam laughing my ass off gave a fucking hundred dollars right now. Thanks for the,

95
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:49,460
thanks for the 10,000 bits, dude. Well, that was an interesting first 15 minutes of the stream.

96
00:15:53,059 --> 00:16:00,039
We've been in the middle of the intro. What were we talking about? I don't know. What were we

97
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:08,340
talking about? It was something important. It was the cow. Oh yeah. The cow's name is Murius.

98
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:15,529
Murius. The cow and everyone, I got a lot of shit for that name. People like, oh, Murius,

99
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,330
come on. Like curious, furious, whatever. Yeah. But you know what the number one suggestion was

100
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:27,529
last night? I looked over here and you know what it was? It's mega milk. So I think my name might

101
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:41,299
have been like a tad better than the number one suggestion. All right. But oh, that's right.

102
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,860
Those of you that weren't here last night, we have, that's a sad tale right now. While I was

103
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:55,029
going off on the sad tale on the intro, Murius was captured and is being tortured right now

104
00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:06,099
over there. And we have to go save him pretty. Yeah. And that is what's happening. I am going

105
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:11,369
to go, I'm going to build up the city. Somebody said last night, I'm going to take this to heart.

106
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:19,210
They said in direct quotes, when you can look at the logs, they said, LOL, he is not ever going

107
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,210
to beat the third level because he didn't pay attention to one of the most important mechanics.

108
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,420
So I'm going to beat the third level because now I'm ready. I'm going to make sure that I have

109
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:35,589
shit ready to go. I'm going to pay attention. And I paid attention yesterday too. But anyways,

110
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:45,529
welcome back everybody. Playing black and white again. All right. So we need wood. Oops. Okay.

111
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:52,460
We need wood. Where's my wood center? Because these people are all, here's my temple, right? Okay.

112
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:01,460
I need some, where's my temple going? Why is this much louder? Oh, it's because I've opened the game.

113
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:10,680
When you open the game and all the volume shit goes crazy. Music is, where's the music? Should

114
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,710
we be getting music? I think I broke the music by like turning it off. All right. That's better.

115
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:25,319
There we go. Cutting the trees. How much wood do they need? Oh, I can just do this. I can help.

116
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,049
Let's get this temple built. How much more does it need?

117
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:45,160
3200. Why does it need so much wood? Bring back mega milk. He's, look, I'll show you. He's currently

118
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,589
being tortured right now. You want to see this? You really want to see this? I can't do anything

119
00:18:49,589 --> 00:19:02,380
about this. There he is. But look at that will. He seems pretty chill. It's because he's frozen

120
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,900
in a weird ice thing. And by the way, this motherfucker is dead. Just wait till I train

121
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,579
with Murius and bring him over here. See, look what he's doing. He's just like burning me. I

122
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:25,099
got to get over there. He's got his hands on his hips. We got a long way to go for the saving of

123
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,819
Murius. There's other towns over here. All right, let's keep going. He does always have that Disney

124
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:44,259
character. Hands on hips, waving at people. All right, we need 1800 wood. Let's go. I need to

125
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:55,980
replant some trees. I miss them already. I really do. All right, we got it. We're good. Nice fax

126
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:08,920
machine. I need to put wood over here. But this shit needs it bad. Did you know? Yeah, yeah. Okay,

127
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,509
this is the store. Somebody, we got to get a builder over here. How many of you guys are builders?

128
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:19,500
What are you? Going to the forest for wood. No, no, no, no, no, not anymore. You're not. Come over here.

129
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,140
We got to get this shit built up.

130
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:34,980
Resident builder. Deciding what to do. I can decide for you. Come here. Builders.

131
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:46,519
All right, we got extra wood. This is extra, right? Yeah. I think that person just fell

132
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:54,710
off the cliff. Supply this shit. All right, come on. Hurry up. I got to like be efficient here.

133
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:13,990
Wait, did I just? What? Oh, fuck. That wasn't done. All right, all right, all right. This does not

134
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:22,920
seem like a good idea. Where are they going? I think, wait, what's this? Oh, I found a wood

135
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:29,769
miracle. Nice. All right, let's put it, uh, I'm gonna put it over here. Miracle of wood.

136
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:48,549
All right, I need 751. We'll just drop it in here. Oh, get on that hype train. All right,

137
00:21:48,549 --> 00:22:03,529
somebody build it. Let's, what was that? Is this mine? I think all this shit is mine.

138
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:14,950
Shut up about the hype train. I'm kidding around. Don't worry. All right, give me that rock.

139
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:22,069
How much more wood does this need? Scaffold value three. No, I mean like build it then.

140
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:28,410
What is it? What's, what's taking, what's the hold up? Is it not buildable?

141
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:40,259
I guess I might have to wait. Rescue mega milk. That's the goal. That's not who that is though.

142
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:49,460
And I don't care if you keep calling him super milk. His name is Murius and I were not calling

143
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:57,829
him the thing that you are calling. Let's get a builder over here. Disciple Forester. No, no,

144
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:07,430
no, no, no, no. Disciple builder. Almost done. Good. Mega milk is easier to spell. It's also

145
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:18,599
porn from what I've been told. So I know that's not what it is. I mean, no, it's not.

146
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:33,220
It's not. It is. It's not. It is. Well, is it or isn't it? The last time I said those two words

147
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,859
together out loud, like a few weeks ago, I saw a scene of dude, shoot, shut the fuck up, dude.

148
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:45,539
You don't know what you're saying. Stop saying this. Shut up, dude. Stop. Like you were nudging

149
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:49,299
me at like the fucking dinner table. We were in front of your parents and you're like, don't

150
00:23:49,299 --> 00:24:06,150
fucking say that in front of my mom and dad, dude. Are you stupid? So I don't know how much wood we

151
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:16,920
get. We're running out of wood. Oh, are we? Not anymore. Look at my miracles. Oh, wait, that was

152
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:26,490
a rock. Fuck. Fix this. Fix it. The village stored is nearly out of food. Fix it. Fix it. He's in

153
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,690
perpetual motion. Oh, no. Fix this. I didn't mean to do that. Oh, god damn it. When am I going to

154
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,819
get? I almost just called him the thing that I'm not supposed to call him. How do I repair

155
00:24:41,819 --> 00:25:03,700
the building? What the fuck, man? All right. It's it's under construction again. All right,

156
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:12,059
we're good. Wear the shirt. I'm not going to wear the shirt. Hypers. Oh, I can't even.

157
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:22,920
I can't keep up. I can't keep up. I know. Well, I mean, where's the it's over here.

158
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:33,240
Is that the only one that has to be more than that around here? Right. I was going to say holy

159
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,440
shit. All right, we've got to we've got to take care of this shit right now. I need a builder.

160
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:53,829
I need more. All right, take it slow. 80. Fucking idiot. What am I? I'm like bird.

161
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:09,059
I need more wood for this. Actually, they're they're making food. Not a lot, but they are.

162
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:16,900
Yeah, they need food right now. I know. I know. I'm working on it. Come over here. Start working

163
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,940
in these fields over here. Disciple farmer. Actually, that's great. I'm actually really

164
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,210
happy. This is perfect. Even if not, if a rival god did this, I don't even care.

165
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:45,769
You're helping me. All right, we need people to work down here. You work over here. Disciple

166
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,430
farmer. Children's Day. Yeah, I got to fix this though. What is this person doing?

167
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:58,740
This is a weird spot, isn't it? Oh shit. He was carrying something. He was trying to fix the

168
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,700
orphanage. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, he was trying to get up there to

169
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:15,819
fix the orphanage. I got you. I got you. They can't get up here. See, it's in a way, it's in

170
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:33,880
like a fucked up spot. Can I move this? I didn't put this here. They can't get in. I don't think

171
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:42,359
they can get in there. It's in a weird angle. Okay, well, I have temple here. All right, let's get

172
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:55,220
the uh, is this thing almost done? Do they eat this person? All right, then we need food now.

173
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,000
Uh-oh. There's uh, oh, we need. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I need to make, I need a miracle.

174
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:14,420
I can look for miracles. You're, okay, you're doing food. Who else is doing food? This still

175
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:20,789
needs to be built. Shitty pathing, too. This is all wrong. I didn't even build this shit. This was

176
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:27,750
given to me. I would have much better spot. All right. Disciple. No, no, do not breed.

177
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:35,940
Disciple builder. How much more wood? Zero? Okay, come here. We need people to make food.

178
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,630
Disciple farmer. The shit is so far away from where they need to be. The village store is

179
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,710
nearly out of food. You're running out of trees. I can make trees. Plus, I can steal them. I can

180
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:59,859
take trees from wherever I want. If the god next door is angry at me. Okay, now I need to do houses.

181
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:08,170
You're a liar and a thief. I don't see any food. All right, what's down here?

182
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,880
Okay, here's the next town over. Is this a neutral town? This town down here is neutral.

183
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,500
What do you got? They got a lot of food in here. All right, I need to send some people down here.

184
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,309
There's food near the orphanage. Yeah, somebody has to get it though.

185
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:36,490
That was, this orphanage is fucked up. All right, should I just like take it?

186
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:44,740
No, no, no, no, no. They have to do this themselves. You come here. Disciple farmer.

187
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,500
We need more farmers. What, what are you guys all up to? Going to farm, going to farm.

188
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,230
Who else? Going to a building site. No, no, no. Farm. Farm instead. Come here.

189
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:06,329
Disciple farmer. Big bits just came in. More big bits. All right. Crookshire gave 5,000 bits.

190
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:15,769
Another 50 fucking dollars. And they say this chat is hype. Get over here.

191
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,619
Disciple farmer. Hype. Getting another important phone call.

192
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:36,869
God damn it. It's going to have to wait. Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing.

193
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:45,740
Where are these people? What is this place? What do you mean dancing? Where are they?

194
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:57,910
Isn't this the production store? Oh my god. I, I gotta, okay.

195
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:11,210
Good. More food. Farm. All, everybody farm. Only farm. What's this person? This person,

196
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:25,349
this is Jeff Keely. What is Jeff Keely doing in this game? Steve Jackson is in this game.

197
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:42,039
That's the, that's sorcery. Wait, are these all game people? Did somebody just who? Steve Jackson?

198
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:54,539
Wait, did, okay. I was going to say that was not like, that wasn't Jeff Keely, right? All right.

199
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Forget about this fucking temple. Going to dead person. No. Come

200
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:12,650
here. No. Stop going to dead person and go get food. Farm. Disciple farmer. Farm. Disciple farmer.

201
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:26,099
They have to mourn. Age 82. All right. My crea- wait a minute. Am I going to get another creature to

202
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:41,480
rescue? Are we going to go on a rescue mission with a new creature? Disciple farmer. All right.

203
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,410
Well, thankfully it rains a lot. Water. Food. All right. I need to do this. I need a food miracle.

204
00:32:48,410 --> 00:33:03,289
I need a site. What's that thing called? I need that thing to tell me. I need more wood in there.

205
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,970
What's it called? The thing that makes some worshipers can go worship.

206
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:30,180
All right. At least there's food in there now. All right. Come on. Build it. I need 4,900 more

207
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:44,200
wood. All right. It's time to start dumping trees. All right. Done. Where? Wood. Tree dump. I know I'm

208
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:57,480
ripping up everything here. I know. But I have to start moving. I'm only going to take the big

209
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:11,539
ones. Not the little ones. I promise. Okay. Is this done? Almost. You're going to have no trees.

210
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:20,059
I can do a spell that gives me trees. Plus, Murius will probably- doesn't Murius know that spell too?

211
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:32,010
Oh no. Murius knows wood, right? All right. What is it for? Does anybody remember what it is for

212
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:44,420
that worship site? Say his name, Jeremy. Who are we talking about? Talking about Murius.

213
00:34:48,630 --> 00:35:21,380
Murius is the- okay. Bear with me here. Say his name, Jeremy. Say his name. Do it. Do it.

214
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:28,360
How much more wood do I need? At least there's a little dollop of fucking gravy in there. All

215
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:41,960
right. Is this almost done? How much more does this have to do? I don't want to breed anybody yet. I

216
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:49,880
don't want any breeding that's going to cause a huge problem. I need to build houses. I need more

217
00:35:49,880 --> 00:36:13,739
wood. My best friend is being tortured. I'm not in a good- I don't like this. But anybody in chat

218
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:24,059
can help me out here. Don't break it! Okay. Jesus Christ. That was scary. What's the recipe for-

219
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:51,219
Get my temples done. All right. My influence grows. Okay. Now your temple looks sinister.

220
00:36:51,219 --> 00:37:00,840
It's- I assure you it's not. Oh, what are they doing here? Is this the worship site? It is,

221
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:11,929
isn't it? All right. Finally. Took long enough. Build that site up. We need to pray- I'm trying.

222
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm trying. I need to make a food spell and- Do not get hit by that rock, please. All right. Is it

223
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:35,460
done? Okay. Here we go. Wow. You did it. Everybody. And I mean everyone. Everyone to the temple. Now,

224
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:43,130
immediately drop everything you're doing and worship me. Tell me kind things. Tell me I'm smart.

225
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:52,360
Tell me I'm fun. We're going to have to sacrifice a couple people too. Yeah. Yeah. Who's-

226
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:10,699
Food! It's already gone. Oh my God. It's already gone. They're so hungry.

227
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:18,889
I can't- It won't even show up on the ground. We have to sacrifice somebody.

228
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:31,030
I seriously can't even get it to show up on the ground. All right. Somebody else has to die.

229
00:38:36,230 --> 00:39:02,389
Yay. They're eating it instantly. All right. Who's dead? No. More. All right. Fill it up.

230
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:23,480
Keep believing. Keep believing. Continue believing in me. I need better fucking- I'm gonna

231
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:40,090
always be in need of food. More. How's everybody doing? We need food. I know. Uh oh. Okay. All

232
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,369
right. All right. All right. All right. One more and then I'm going to drop it down to like 30%.

233
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:56,820
Miracle food. I'm going to sacrifice one more person. Okay. That's good. I just dropped the

234
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,760
food over here. Whoops. I'll get it. Back to work. Sacrificing people means less people that need to

235
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,440
eat. This is true, but it also means I have to make sure that I'm not going to be unbreedable.

236
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:20,340
I don't want to kill everybody. All right. So now we still have these people there.

237
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:30,889
Give me more food. They switch off, right? What do you mean unbreedable? Like if there's- if I kill

238
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:37,369
all the men in the area, if I kill all the women, then there ain't going to be any more babies.

239
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:48,179
That's what I mean. All right. It's time to start growing influence. Everyone. How's everybody doing?

240
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,500
Everyone okay? Going to sleep on the floor. Okay. Now it's time for me to build.

241
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:07,380
Uh, what are they doing over here? What is Jeff Keeley building? What is this? Is this a game

242
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:26,019
awards arena? Maybe. He's building a statue of Kojima. What the fuck? Well, is this a house?

243
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:36,809
Maybe they're doing that on their own. All right. We're okay. I need to make a couple more houses.

244
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:47,179
Another civic building. All right. It's time to start ripping trees out. I need to build more

245
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:55,989
shit over here because I need to spread into here and take this place over. I also need this shit

246
00:41:55,989 --> 00:42:04,230
too. I- I feel like this building is not being used. Like it can't be used. Oh, they are. They're

247
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:13,780
making settlements. What did you guys? Okay. Uh, let's go over here. Let's get some- let's get more

248
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:23,750
food. I'm going to get this to about 10,000. What's in there now? 4,000. Now do it like two,

249
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:35,559
three more times. You already forgot about Mega. I did not. Hey Streamer, just letting me know your

250
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:45,849
face cam is on. Oh, how embarrassing. I need a ton more wood. Where is there a forest I can just

251
00:42:45,849 --> 00:43:01,829
rip out of? Save the cow? To save the cow, I need a strong enough base of followers. I can't just

252
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:08,650
go save the cow. Damn it. I really need a bunch of more wood. All right. Let's zoom this out so

253
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:17,739
I can see and just dump it into there. 7,600 wood. I need way more than that. I'll replace it.

254
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:41,690
How much wood is in there now? 8,300. Okay. I need like 20,000 wood because that's going to help me

255
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:52,519
build more civic buildings, which is what I need, right? 20,000 and I'm done. And then I'll plant a

256
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:58,920
fake forest. I'll plant a magic forest eventually. Don't worry. This is all going to get replaced.

257
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:17,480
Is that a rock? No. All right. What is that? 14,000? Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.

258
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:29,539
No complaints yet. Yet. Don't pick the little ones. Only the baby. Here we go. I keep hearing

259
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:36,659
somebody scream. Who's this monster that keeps fucking screaming? All right. Do food again.

260
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:52,840
Everybody's taken care of now. I'll do one more food and then I'm out of trees and shit. I'm

261
00:44:52,840 --> 00:45:00,420
going to have to do tree miracles, wood miracles. Your son is screaming in pain.

262
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:11,130
My son's not a miracle food. All right. Let's start making shit. I need a civic building,

263
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:26,179
right? I need three. That's two there already. I already have one. So what do I need to do to get

264
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:40,599
worshippers to be able to help me move out and continue? I hope I'm trapped. I just need more

265
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:55,099
people. All right. Well, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do a big house. This isn't a boat. All

266
00:45:55,099 --> 00:46:01,349
right. Let's put this. I wish I could make another one of those. I'm going to put this down here so

267
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:10,659
people can farm easier over here. You know, we're going to make these people over here the farmers.

268
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:21,530
Workshop. Here we go. All right. How do I cycle between what these are? Graveyard.

269
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:31,139
Should I make a graveyard of dead people? Do people like that? I need the graveyard.

270
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:45,610
How do you cycle between this shit? Workshop. No, I don't have enough influence to go that way yet.

271
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:52,309
How about down here? How did the graveyard down here? But it's not the graveyard yet.

272
00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:05,050
Make another abode. I got to put that in a better spot. I wish I could make a farm over here.

273
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:16,780
All right. Making an abode. Abode right there. And then another abode right here.

274
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:27,369
Okay. So now people can actually live here and work here.

275
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:43,400
It's four scaffolds for a field. Oh, fuck. Okay. Let's do that. Do you put a storm? Get down.

276
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:59,639
Miracle food. So four and I'll put another field down. Yeah, that's a good idea.

277
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:11,929
I do need more wood though. Fuck. This game's so fun. All right. I need more wood. Let's do

278
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:16,969
the wood miracle. What is it? This one. Here it is. I don't have a wood miracle. Uh-oh.

279
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:40,360
Oh, that's very bad. That's very bad. Miracle food. I have to. This is very bad. Under the

280
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,909
waterfall. This is that dispenser. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. I did grab this. You're right.

281
00:48:46,869 --> 00:49:02,630
Okay. How much wood do you need? That's not a whole lot though. That's not a whole lot of wood.

282
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:13,820
All right. It's four you said, right? We need another field. Oh, no. Maybe I should start

283
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:24,059
breeding the fuck out of everybody. What do you think? Pick up and replace the trees.

284
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:34,219
Water.

285
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:37,340
A miracle shower.

286
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:55,119
Hold on. Should I just water shit? This is not like Stardew Valley, right? Hey.

287
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:19,840
Oh, okay. It's four. What should I do here? I have five. Bigger house, civic building,

288
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:27,900
make a field, make a new village center. What words to make a field? Should I make a field?

289
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:42,920
Build a streamer house. I'm going to make a field. Here we go. Field. And I'm going to put this

290
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:48,599
shit. That's only one field. All right. I'm going to put this right. I'm going to put this over here

291
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:54,280
because this is too far of a walk. And then I'll put, I get to put like a new store building over

292
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:03,480
there. All right. I'm going to put it right here. That's a, that's a long, that's not, I don't want

293
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:12,619
that to be a long walk. All right. Food is starting to become a surplus. I have to work. What are you

294
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:22,679
doing? Don't sleep off. All right. Trees. Trees. I need, did I, did I just fuck this whole play

295
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:41,039
through because I pulled up all the trees. I can do this. Look, look what I'm doing.

296
00:51:42,119 --> 00:52:01,119
I'm relocating this forest over here. Theft. This is not theft. Maybe not yet. I'm going to water

297
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:26,059
these trees after and we'll see what happens. Okay. Just let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Stop. Let

298
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:36,829
it give me. All right. There's only one more. Look at all this over here too. Okay. Miracle of water.

299
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:58,329
Let's go. All right. Let's see what happens. Do they grow? How are we doing over here? Is my field

300
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:09,260
done? No one's even started building this yet. Where is everybody? Somebody build this. All right.

301
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:17,530
Jeff Keighley. Build this. You're going to do it now. Like Jeff Keighley. You're really good at like

302
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,280
building shit. I've already seen you build like two. All right. You don't want to. Just do it.

303
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:44,349
He doesn't want to. Going to sleep on floor. I need more houses. Holy shit. You live a dangerous

304
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:52,119
life. Going to sleep on the floor at the edge of the cliff where the waterfall is. Sleeping upside

305
00:53:52,119 --> 00:54:16,269
down. Insane. All right. So. Leave it. I'm not worth it. What just happened? I don't know what

306
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:43,769
that was. Was that another god? Actor. Is this the person talking? He's rehearsing his lines.

307
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:55,719
Should I just go get him? All right. I'm going to go get him. Actor. Go on. He's dumb. I got him.

308
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:14,489
Okay. Now. Breed? I'll do your worst but don't throw me though.

309
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:19,289
That the game's telling me to throw this person. But no. We're going to. We're going to breed?

310
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:28,280
Wait. Just what? What? What happened? You big bully. Try it again and you're dead.

311
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:39,630
Please don't throw me. Oh you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me.

312
00:55:39,630 --> 00:56:06,719
You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Uh. Why are we getting a slow mo cut scene?

313
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:17,789
Oh hell. You big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me. What?

314
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:36,190
What is this? Guy getting a special cut scene. Oh hell. Free influence. You didn't kill me.

315
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:47,789
Please don't throw me. Hey guys. Look at this. He's. Okay. You remember that game. Like kick

316
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:54,489

317
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:58,489
poke him and stuff and he gets up and does this. Oh you big. Please don't throw me.

318
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh hell. Am I getting points for this? You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Watch out lady.

319
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:32,329
Keep this guy in a box to him. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. All right. What do I need

320
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:48,320
for. How much belief do I need? He keeps flying. Is that him screaming in slow motion? Do it as

321
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:55,050
far as possible. Oh man. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. This actually is just

322
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:59,530
free influence though. All right. Fine. He's going for a long ride.

323
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:24,510
Oh you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me.

324
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:42,320
What am I supposed to do with this guy? Oh hell. Kill him. I can't. Oh you big bully. Try it again

325
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:53,849
and you're dead. Please don't throw me. Ladies and gentlemen. The flying man. Are you not impressed

326
00:58:53,849 --> 00:59:03,659
by the skills of the gods? My leg. Just know me. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me.

327
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:15,230
I can't. All right. He's coming with me. Come with me. Oh there's a quest. All right. He's

328
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:19,469
coming with me. How do I lock him somewhere? How do I keep him somewhere? Should I just put a series

329
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:27,309
of rocks around him? Why would I do that in my own village? Well he's dead. He doesn't.

330
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:39,309
Feed him. Oh that's right. I'll feed him to the animal. On my arm. All right. Let him. You didn't

331
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:46,559
kill me. Whatever. He's called actor. There's a scroll over here. What was it? I just saw it

332
00:59:46,559 --> 01:00:07,659
right there. What is that? Ah I see a god. Greetings. I am a guru and a yogi. I am off

333
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:14,539
to meditate and increase my powers. I have a secret place for this. Please don't follow me there.

334
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:25,980
That is all. So we follow him there. Right. You know what? Let's follow him. But let's make sure

335
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:33,260
he doesn't see us. Really. Following yogis isn't my idea of godly behavior. Don't follow me.

336
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:53,789
I ain't following you. Don't worry. This is just one of those awkward moments where we both say

337
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:59,710
bye. We both hug. We both say our goodbyes and then we both realize fuck we're both going the same way.

338
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,349
We're both gonna walk down the same street for like another 10 minutes.

339
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:08,250
See you later again. I guess. We already talked about everything. We already said bye. So we don't

340
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:15,769
talk. It's just fucking weird. I hate this. What's he doing? I wish I had. I wish I had my friend.

341
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:40,349
Where's my friend? Where's the. Where's. What's his name? Murius. I wish Murius was here. Don't you?

342
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:58,400
I don't know that name. So what do I. What do I get for this?

343
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,679
Breed already. I'm doing a reverse escort quest. I'm doing an escort quest that he doesn't know

344
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:16,840
I'm on. Jerma's mom? Well like what? Like I dropped off my kid somewhere or like dropped off my kid

345
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:31,920
at the mall. And I'm gonna have fun. Yeah I'll pick you up in an hour. And then what you don't know is

346
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:39,739
your mother actually stays at the mall and like sees where you are. And then she's like oh my god.

347
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:46,059
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

348
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:54,650
And like sees where you went. And just has the newspaper up and like looks over when you're

349
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:05,280
going into fucking like EB games or whatever the hell it is. And then she pulls up in the car where

350
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:22,030
you're supposed to meet. Wait what's that? What is this? Checkpoint. You followed me so I'm going

351
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:27,630
back home now. What? He saw us boss. We gotta try again. What do you mean he saw us? Wait what?

352
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:34,199
What? Wait did you see the- hold on. Did you see the hand? I don't understand. Hold on. He can see

353
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:41,079
me. Am I just like peering in looking at him? It's the hand? He get- if he actually sees the hand.

354
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:55,710
Oh he's just skipping. He's skipping now. He's sliding. Wait what's going on?

355
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:14,809
You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Isn't he down here? Uh oh.

356
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:25,389
We may have got a game crash scenario. Hold on. Let it sit here for a sec.

357
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:30,440
There we are. All right. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Stay away from him then. Jesus.

358
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,440
Gosh he's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's going to be back at his temple later.

359
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,039
What are you talking about? I'm sitting here looking at him. He's right here.

360
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:20,239
What the fuck is going on? Uh okay. Okay I think we'll come back to this. Is he walking again?

361
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:36,639
Um. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Okay. I don't know what-

362
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:45,079
so is it the hand? It's got to be the hand or is it my- all right. So is it my point of view or

363
01:05:45,079 --> 01:06:11,639
is it just the hand? It's the camera. You followed me. What the fuck? I- He saw us boss. We gotta try

364
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:18,039
again. Rats. I'm looking all- I'm like peering over the edge here. What's he doing over there?

365
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:21,639
I'm supposed to hide my face? How am I supposed to do that without losing him?

366
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:31,900
Should I be down here? The camera's always going to be able to see him somewhere.

367
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,550
Like should I- but if I go- all right here he comes again. All right there he is.

368
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:47,440
Okay it's impossible for me to hide because I imagine myself being 500 feet wide as a face.

369
01:06:48,239 --> 01:07:11,199
Is he gonna move? I think it's fucked and it- no it has to start over again

370
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:22,920
because remember he has to go, oh you followed me. I'm gonna try this one more time. Yeah and it's

371
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:30,349
gonna glitch out for 30 seconds. Please don't try it again. That is all. Okay so let me get this

372
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:40,059
straight again. It's just- if I go too far away he- they- I lost him boss! But if I go too close

373
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:59,679
he can see my 500 foot wide face. Stay above him? So just like get- just float above him

374
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:17,340
like this so he can't see me. He's- he can't see me right? He can't see the hand either.

375
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:33,930
You followed me. What the- I'm huge! I'm huge! We gotta try again. Rats! You can't hide when you

376
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:43,550
are this big. If I go over here he's gonna- we're gonna lose him. You followed me earlier.

377
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:48,989
Please don't try it again. Wait copy paste that. Copy paste it. Copy paste it. Somebody just said

378
01:08:48,989 --> 01:09:07,130
what in order to what? Okay stay- keep the camera behind him. So you're saying like just stay with

379
01:09:07,130 --> 01:10:06,479
him and stay behind him. Oh fuck. Which way is he? How is this not more noticeable? Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

380
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh fuck. Get behind the rock. Save the game? You can't save the game. There is no save game.

381
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:43,479
It's autosave or you have to go into the temple. Oh fuck! We got a checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

382
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:46,920
Checkpoint. Checkpoints. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. By the way saving the

383
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,159
game crashes the game on Windows 10. That's what I was told. We're fine. We got a new checkpoint

384
01:10:51,159 --> 01:11:08,670
right here. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Have you tested that

385
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:14,590
once? No I just believed what one person with negative two points on Reddit said. You followed

386
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:18,590
me so I'm going back home now. What the fuck? I didn't even start. I just had a cut scene.

387
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:38,199
We gotta try again. Rats. You followed me earlier. Yes I did. Please don't try it again. All right.

388
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:42,680
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Here we go. I have to wrap- I have to whip

389
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,199
around him to the left side. You followed me so I'm going back home now. What the fuck is going-

390
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:58,250
This is ridiculous. We gotta try again. Rats. I think I can do it. I have to rip around to

391
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:07,020
the other side of the building. Oh my god. Game break. You followed me earlier. Please don't try

392
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:18,800
it again. I have to go. I'm just ripping away. Gosh he's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's

393
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:34,119
bound to be back at his temple. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all.

394
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:45,470
Hold on. If I pull back a little bit behind the rock, I just have to zoom out. Here we go. Don't-

395
01:12:45,470 --> 01:13:01,079
Jesus. Okay here we go. He's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's bound to be back at his temple.

396
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:13,239
I was coming in. What the- Why are we doing this? I don't know. This probably- I don't know. I don't

397
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:17,800
know. Please don't try it again. That is all. Just kill him. No we're so close. This is the

398
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:29,279
second checkpoint. There's probably one more mushroom turn and that's it. Okay but look at the-

399
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:41,369
This is so odd. Is he done? Start walking. Okay I have to rip the camera around.

400
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:58,170
In fact, let's go over here. You followed me so I'm going home now. Liar. Liar. You can't see me.

401
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:04,729
Oh we gotta try again. Liar. Rats. Liar. Liar. I'm under- What? Do you see my hair?

402
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:26,199
You followed me earlier. Please don't try it. That is all. Okay. You followed me so I'm going

403
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:31,720
back home now. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore. I can't do it anymore. I can't

404
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,920
do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. It's so finicky. It's so weird. It's so glitchy and sloppy.

405
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:46,279
I can't do it. I- I- I- I'm so close. You follow- Please don't. That is all. Okay. Zoom the fuck

406
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:56,189
out quick and then come back in. And then the camera has to be behind him. So I have to rip

407
01:14:56,189 --> 01:15:02,890
the camera around his left side. I have to. Jesus, man. Even the tiny little- Is he going?

408
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:25,579
He's going. Please quick. He gave us the slip there. Oh it's- You don't- This is so fucked up.

409
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:33,960
You follow- Please don't. That is all. Why did I zoom in? I didn't. I moved the camera to the left

410
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:41,479
and this terrain. So you go- Up. Up. Up. I'm right on terrain. Please quick. He gave us the slip there.

411
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:53,390
He's bound to be back at his temple later. What about- I did directly above. Directly above doesn't

412
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:57,869
do anything. He sees you. You have to be directly behind him. But to be directly- You- I'm- This is

413
01:15:57,869 --> 01:16:06,720
like an RTS camera that I have to stick up this guy's fucking- I'm controlling an RTS camera.

414
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:34,000
It's not like I can- I'm walking behind of a third person. Please quick. I- This- This- Oh my god.

415
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:46,010
You can't. You can't. There's a wall in the way and the camera hits the wall and points down.

416
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:50,649
Please don't try it again. That is all. Zoom. I'm gonna- If I zoom out, it's gonna lose him.

417
01:16:50,649 --> 01:17:01,359
If I- If I go across- It's gonna lose him. Stay below the ridge? I just did that shit and he saw me.

418
01:17:10,909 --> 01:17:15,550
Go lower than that. Watch this. Alright, fine. Let's go lower than that.

419
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:27,720
Oh gosh. He's- He's quick, isn't he? You followed me so I'm going back home.

420
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:36,539
Alright. All the chat detectives. All the fucking chat detectives. Go ahead. Do I- Do I get- Do I

421
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:47,979
get some- Some slack? You followed me earlier. Please- Keep you back to the cliff. I've done

422
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:52,380
that three times. And every time the camera- Because it's a fucking RTS camera. It hits the

423
01:17:52,380 --> 01:18:19,159
fucking goddamn side of the wall and goes- I'm not doing that. See? I- Do you see what's happening?

424
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:28,840
I can't even move the fucking camera. Alright. What do I do now? What do I do? What do I do? What

425
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:34,729
do I do? Which way? You followed me so I'm going back home now. Come on! What the fuck?

426
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:46,920
He saw us, boss. We gotta try again. What? Dude, no way. No way, man. Like, no way.

427
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:56,300
Rotate quicker? Alright. Let's give me a break. You followed me. Please, that is all.

428
01:18:56,939 --> 01:19:02,560
I gotta save? I'm not gonna go to the temple and load the save, am I?

429
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:22,920
P to pause the game. What? I've got magical fucking Adam Sandler powers?

430
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:39,119
What? Are you shitting me? Oh my fucking god. Give me a fucking break. You gotta be kidding me.

431
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:21,710
Which way is he turning? Which way is he turning? Does he turn to his left? You followed me.

432
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:36,810
He saw us, boss. We gotta try again. He saw through the powers. Oh my god.

433
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:42,560
You followed me. Please, that is all.

434
01:20:43,770 --> 01:21:17,819
Oh, Jesus Christ. This is fucking ridiculous, man. This is ridiculous. Alright, pause it.

435
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:33,449
Why would they put... If you have to go around this way, why would this mountain be here?

436
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:54,800
Do you see what's happening? You followed me so I'm going back home. He saw us, boss.

437
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:09,279
We gotta try again. Rats. My... Give me a... I'm doing this one more time and I'm throwing this

438
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:19,600
guy in the ocean. You followed me. Please, don't. That is all. It's like, honest to god,

439
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:26,079
this is way too complicated for how stupid this is. You followed me so I'm going back home now.

440
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:39,529
Kill him. Kill him. We gotta try again. Kill this guy. Rats. Kill him. You followed me earlier.

441
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:45,609
Please, don't. That is all. Wait, wait, wait. Somebody said 10 in-game years have passed?

442
01:22:48,010 --> 01:23:21,399
Alright, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do it now. Here it comes. This fucking wall has no reason to

443
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:31,979
be here besides to make this part stupid. It's just really... If I go... I can't go any further.

444
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:48,430
He'll see me if I'm right here. He'll see me if I'm up here. He's gonna see me. It has to be down

445
01:23:48,430 --> 01:24:04,680
here. No, it has to be down here. But no, it doesn't. Alright, are we ready? Are we ready?

446
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:19,149
Ready? It doesn't. It doesn't have to be down there. Doesn't have to be down there. Alright.

447
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:29,949
What if I lose him though? What if I lose him? Why do I have carrot hands? I don't know what that

448
01:24:29,949 --> 01:24:36,680
means. Carrot hands? Alright, am I in the... Zoom in for a second. Alright, I'm good. Back here.

449
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:53,079
This is good. Guys, guys, guys. He was looking this way. He was this way. He was fucking looking

450
01:24:53,079 --> 01:25:07,710
over here and I'm standing over here like this. Stay low to the ground. Get up higher. Stay low

451
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:11,789
to the ground. Eat those berries. Shove those berries up your ass. Smell the berries.

452
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:35,770
Get the milk. Eat the milk. Drink the milk. What the fuck? Too many people with too many

453
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:46,859
conflicting opinions. I'm trying. Oh my god. Damn it. This is gonna drive me crazy, man.

454
01:25:47,819 --> 01:26:20,760
Murius is being tortured right now. I know. It's terrible. It's terrible. I know. Don't look at me.

455
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:28,649
Oh, is he looking at me? You have to be. He's got like a 500 degree radius of an angle to see.

456
01:26:29,850 --> 01:27:20,409
Can he see? Is he gonna see me right here? Read chat. Reach. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma,

457
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:24,409
look at the chat. Look at when the when the yogi reaches a patch of tall blue mushrooms.

458
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:31,640
Swiftly circle around to the left. Wait, what? The yogi will look around. Hold on. It's going

459
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:40,640
too fast. I can't see. Okay, this is directing the wiki. Patch of tall blue mushrooms. Swiftly,

460
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,920
swiftly circle around to the left towards the center of the mountain. The yogi will look around

461
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,680
twice before starting to walk again. You need to rotate back to your original position before he

462
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,000
starts walking. Time your move carefully so you start rotating. I did that. No, this is too broken

463
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:00,079
to do that. I'm already here. You followed me, so I'm going back home now. He saw us, boss.

464
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:06,319
We gotta try again. Okay, I'm beginning to believe that this is absolute horseshit. I am

465
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:18,350
directly behind him. I am directly behind him and he turns around 180 fucking degrees.

466
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:41,100
You followed me. So you want me to go like this. Up here and go. Going against everything that

467
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:50,270
everybody in this chat has screamed at me not to do. This is gonna be fucking impossible.

468
01:28:55,159 --> 01:29:10,890
Why does it have to be like this? Just do it with pause spam. Zoom all the way into his back.

469
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:22,510
He's gonna see me. Just leave him alone. People are dying. People are suffering in my village.

470
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:33,239
Pause the game. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna get right behind him and you say around to the left

471
01:29:33,239 --> 01:30:01,359
and then around to the right. Fucking RTS camera, man. I swear to god. Okay, here we go. I can't go

472
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:39,689
down any further than this. I can't. I can't go down any further. Closer. Get so close. Get close,

473
01:30:39,689 --> 01:30:58,439
close, close, close, closer, closer, closer. I shouldn't be this close. His body needs to

474
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:37,119
fill the screen. Crush him. Crush him. Hit him on the head with a carrot. The camera's fucking with

475
01:31:37,119 --> 01:32:12,779
me here. I need to be able to see him. Okay. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Stop. Don't move. This is hurting me.

476
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:28,060
Swifter. The second I see his shoulder turn, I gotta move. Close, close, closer, closer. Don't

477
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:31,579
lose him. Closer. What are you talking about? Leave me alone. This is too stressful for you.

478
01:32:32,220 --> 01:33:09,159
What? Here he goes. Is this correct? Is this correct? No. What do you mean no? Behind him.

479
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:32,239
This is, okay, this is, this is as behind a person you could possibly be behind. Don't fucking do

480
01:33:32,239 --> 01:34:11,470
that. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? So it's a, so the encounter is just broken,

481
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:19,130
is what we're saying. It's a broken ass encounter? You followed me earlier. Please don't, that is all.

482
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:26,649
So he's getting bald. I, this is ridiculous. He's gonna check twice. That wasn't even checking

483
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:46,439
twice. That was him just fucking standing there. I was, I'm about to give up on this shit. Watch

484
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:54,680
a YouTube tutorial. This is the kind of shit that you have save states every half second.

485
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:32,890
Oh my god. This camera is gonna make me die. Like, I'm done. I'm done after this. If I don't do this

486
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:37,449
I ain't doing this. Oh well, I'll drop a rock on this guy's house. I don't care.

487
01:35:38,409 --> 01:36:00,239
This is stupid. So I'm going back home now. This guy's hand is in front of the guy. This

488
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:06,119
guy's hand is in front of him. These are the wrong mushrooms. Wrong mushrooms. Not even the

489
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:14,119
right mushrooms. Okay, hold on. The, hold on. The title of this video is following the yogi

490
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:18,680
and the description is annoying little shit ruined hours of my childhood.

491
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:47,020
What? This is not even the right mushrooms. Is it? Were those the right mushrooms? That's

492
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:52,539
that's wrong. Dude, he's putting his hand in front of this guy. If I did. No, that is the right

493
01:36:52,539 --> 01:36:59,319
mushrooms. Hold on. How did he do this shit? I fucking did this. I swear to god. I did this shit.

494
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:04,560
I did this. We're gonna watch this video on stream because I did this shit and you all know it.

495
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:24,720
Watch this with me. I did this. I got spotted from a fucking mile away when I did this.

496
01:37:31,659 --> 01:37:47,739
I, I did. He saw us, boys. We're gonna try again. So you go up here and like hide up here and like

497
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:54,220
go like this, like this and like this. I don't know, man. It's, I think my game's broken.

498
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:07,579
Because he's putting his hand in front of his face. You fuck. You fuck. You fuck. What?

499
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:20,939
What's going on? What's going on? What? What? What? What? What? What? Oh, all right. I'm gonna try

500
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:27,720
this thing where you looks like you go up above him kind of. Hold on. Pause the game. This camera

501
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:49,899
is fucked up. So I gotta get up above there. These are not the same mushrooms from the video.

502
01:38:53,050 --> 01:39:03,050
What? What are you talking about? Yes, they are. Okay. All right. What does he do? What does the

503
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:13,470
guy in the video do? All right. In the video, the guy is standing right here like this. I'm

504
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,510
gonna go to the, I'm gonna go to the exact, I'm gonna fucking put the video on screen

505
01:39:17,149 --> 01:40:00,319
and I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna do it frame by frame, frame by frame. Hold on. Okay. So let's

506
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:09,210
get to the starting point when he gets, where is it? Right here. Okay. So there he is. He's walking

507
01:40:09,289 --> 01:40:15,880
up. I guess this is an HD. So he gets it. I want to see where he is. Okay. Right. Okay. Right there.

508
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:31,689
Not close. All right. Let's go. I gotta go over here. I need to put this on my, on my stream

509
01:40:31,689 --> 01:40:40,960
deck. Hold on. Cause it'll be easy to switch back and forth. Lower my resolution. No, no,

510
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:59,630
I'm not doing that. I play in HD. Let me just get this on my stream deck. Okay. There it is. So.

511
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:12,399
Oh, pause, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it. Okay. I can't see. I can't see what he's doing.

512
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:50,840
Am I in the right spot? Kind of to the left, right? Not left. I it's, I'm trying to look at

513
01:41:50,840 --> 01:42:14,909
two different screens. Why is it game different? That's pretty close. Okay. What does he do next?

514
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:25,399
Jeremy, this is not content. This is not, I'm trying, this is not supposed to be.

515
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:30,760
This is me trying to beat this, this stupid fucking childhood ruining dumb part of the game.

516
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:43,279
I don't, I'm trying to win. What happens next? Okay. What does he do when he turns?

517
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:51,100
I can't, I can't even fucking see what's going on. All right. So as he stays here,

518
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:59,819
he then lowers the camera down to, okay. I see where that is. Wait, can you guys see this?

519
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:06,119
He lowers the camera down and he start. Okay. So he lowers. Do you see what happened?

520
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:20,970
He low. Wait, why are you not getting this? Oh, I'm an idiot. I'm playing it in the other window,

521
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:24,569
not the one that's the browser source. Okay. So what does he go from here?

522
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:43,960
Plus the singing HD. Okay. So where does he move from here? So he dips down, right? Okay. He dips

523
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:51,390
down. He's about to turn. So he's, he's, he's about to turn right there. Okay. Do you see what that

524
01:43:51,390 --> 01:44:18,439
is? I'm going to get it in the exact fucking spot. Is that good? It's like right there,

525
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:41,149
a little bit more to the left. It's almost indecipherable. Okay. It's tilted up a little

526
01:44:41,149 --> 01:45:04,119
and back. Yeah, it is. It's like this. I gotta be like tilted down and then this way. Okay. Like

527
01:45:04,119 --> 01:45:11,100
that. Okay. You can't tell me that that's almost fucking a hundred percent the same image. That's

528
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:32,170
the same image. Okay. So now what does he do from here? Okay. Right when he turns, he dips down to

529
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:46,279
there. Let's look at it one more time. There's the turn. He has now turned what he's now 100%

530
01:45:46,279 --> 01:45:53,319
turned. And then he dips down to there, covering himself and that top part of that tree right there.

531
01:45:56,939 --> 01:46:09,840
Okay. Here we go. This is important. So let me just, let me, so pause, pause. Oh,

532
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:16,560
the game on pause guys, the game unpaused when I clicked back over on the screen,

533
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:22,720
I wasn't ready for that. When I see escape, when I went to continue, it was paused.

534
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:33,579
When I hit continue, the game unpauses itself. It was paused. Pause. Okay. Continue. Games unpaused.

535
01:46:33,579 --> 01:46:43,800
Fuck. I know what. Oh, you followed me. Please don't try it again. That is all I have.

536
01:46:44,359 --> 01:47:01,050
Yeah, I did. Oh my fucking God. This is stupid. This is the stupidest thing ever.

537
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:14,569
This video only has a thousand views, but I know a thousand of us that have seen this video are like,

538
01:47:14,569 --> 01:47:25,239
yeah, fuck this guy and fuck this part of the game. Fuck this guy. But I'm 1089 of people that

539
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:31,199
clicked on that video and said, yeah, holy shit, this guy sucks. It's a thousand of us strong.

540
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:47,579
What's the context? You have to follow a guy with an RTS camera and he has like a

541
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:55,359
7,000 degree viewing angle. And God damn it. Game unpauses itself after I had escaped.

542
01:47:56,439 --> 01:48:04,760
Is this correct? What? Don't do, I have to, okay, I have to like change windows. Do not hit escape.

543
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:17,340
Just only change window. This is the last time I'm doing this. That's it. That's close. That's

544
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:52,829
pretty close. Okay. Increase your FOV. I can't fucking believe I'm still doing this shit.

545
01:48:53,630 --> 01:49:02,649
Okay. All right. Why does this game have to be so finicky? If you don't finish this,

546
01:49:06,699 --> 01:49:10,939
I'm not doing like a routine here, guys. Look at the fucking description of this video.

547
01:49:12,729 --> 01:49:16,649
Annoying little shit ruins hours of my childhood. I didn't make this video.

548
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:49,560
Okay. This is it. It's going to be a little bit further like this. Okay. That's close enough.

549
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:54,119
Seriously. That is as close as I'm going to get it for like a fifth thousandth fucking time doing

550
01:49:54,119 --> 01:50:12,970
this shit. Okay. He wraps around. I'm done after this. I have to stop it. When he, when he gets,

551
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:28,090
I have to grab here. And when he turns, spin around. It's after he turns. There it is. The

552
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:42,560
camera has to be literally right here. Remember that tree further? Yeah. It's where's the tree

553
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:54,890
in our, we have to hold on. Okay. He comes back up and this way. Fuck man. I feel like that's,

554
01:50:54,890 --> 01:51:01,739
this is not going to work. I don't think this is going to work. He comes out of there and is

555
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:24,489
sitting here and then he just stays behind him. So, so at this point he, when he starts walking,

556
01:51:24,489 --> 01:51:30,989
so he begins his walk. I got to come out. Okay. So I have to come back out and up and then get

557
01:51:30,989 --> 01:51:38,779
a little bit closer and keep tilting. Oh, fuck me, man. Okay. He hasn't started really. Okay.

558
01:51:38,779 --> 01:51:58,810
He started walking now and then where is he? He started walking. All right. So he, he started

559
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:36,430
his walk. All right. Fuck. Hold on. Hold on. I got to zoom out a little here. Get the fuck out.

560
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:42,640
All right. Am I, is it ready to meet? Can I come out? Can I come out? Can I come out?

561
01:52:44,729 --> 01:52:48,329
I think I can, I can come out now, right? This is what happens in the video, doesn't it?

562
01:52:53,949 --> 01:53:03,449
Yes. Is this, am I, am I safe right here? Is this correct? This is correct, right? Yeah.

563
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:35,180
I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

564
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:56,409
Wait, what does he do? What? What do you mean refresh the page? What? Black and white following

565
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:11,609
the yogi and it says annoying little shit. Wait, hold on. Read the description again.

566
01:54:11,609 --> 01:54:29,050
Jerma sucks. What? How did, are you watching the stream? Annoying little shit. Runaway. Jerma

567
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:55,850
sucks by the way. Hold on. I want to get lovely. This is fucking lovely. Oh, lovely. Yeah. Lovely.

568
01:54:55,850 --> 01:55:10,600
I'm so happy about this. Hold on. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

569
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:14,600
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm doing that yet. I'm doing that. Yeah. I just broke the whole game.

570
01:55:15,399 --> 01:55:18,359
I don't care. I don't care. I was going to, I was going to show all the comments.

571
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:33,770
Everyone's being real nice. All right. Pa, unpause. Does he, does he turn around again? Is this the

572
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:44,539
end or does he turn around again? Save the game. I can't, it might crash. Okay. Let me just check

573
01:55:44,539 --> 01:56:12,720
the video. Check the video. Check the video. Delete the video before he can beat it. Delete

574
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:20,239
the video. Shut up. Do not even think about it. Don't delete this video. Don't delete this video.

575
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:32,779
I need it. I need this video. Do not delete this video. It doesn't matter if he deletes it. I still

576
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:42,109
have it in my queue. All right. Then he goes, he doesn't turn around again. You just have to stay

577
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:52,779
behind him. There is more. How much more is there? Why is there more? There can't be more.

578
01:56:53,739 --> 01:57:16,670
No, I don't want to do more. Oh my God. Is there a checkpoint here? Is there a checkpoint?

579
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:45,180
Fuck. But he goes, where does he go? Save the game. If I save the game in a crash,

580
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,680
I'm going to be fucking really mad. All right. That's the end. All right. If I save the game,

581
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:56,890
the game crashes. I'm going to fucking be, I'm going to explode. Control S. If I do this,

582
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:07,310
Control S. Don't. Do not. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do

583
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:34,479
it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Do it. Don't do it. Should I do

584
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:52,729
it? Don't. So many people are saying no. That's too risky. What if I exit the game right now?

585
01:58:54,590 --> 01:59:11,720
Okay. If I exit the game right now, it's going to say no. Just stay behind him. All right. What

586
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:19,319
does he come out from out there? Control S. Fuck. I am so, now get over, it's over here, right?

587
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:22,680
Not yet. I don't know. This is fucking horrible. I don't know what to do.

588
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:39,770
Just carry him laughing my ass off. On top of the rock. What happened in the video? I hope you

589
01:59:39,770 --> 02:00:04,989
didn't delete it. He's not deleted. He didn't delete it. He goes under the rock and then as

590
02:00:04,989 --> 02:00:13,149
he goes underneath when he, he's, he's underneath mine completely. All right. He's under the rock.

591
02:00:13,149 --> 02:00:19,340
You just stay above the rock and let him come out. Wait up here until, again, when he comes out,

592
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:37,560
you start to move towards him. Okay. I'll get there. Let's do that on mine. Where is he?

593
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:58,569
Okay. And then now he's almost the top of that little hill. Okay. He's at the top of that little

594
02:00:58,569 --> 02:01:06,560
hill. Okay. Now what does he do? Now what happens? He's at the top of the hill. Is he at the top of

595
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:14,760
the hill on this one too? Now what? He bent. Okay. He, I see that little pit. See that. What

596
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:31,119
happened? He starts to turn this way and he stays, he stays right here. He stays in this general area

597
02:01:31,119 --> 02:02:08,010
right here. So he stays like here, like this, like that, right? Closer, like right there. Okay.

598
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:40,600
And then just please don't see me. Right. Just stay here. Right. I, I, okay. When he starts,

599
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:43,000
what does that happen? When he starts to move, when he starts moving, where do I go?

600
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:59,119
What's wrong? I thought he deleted it. I'm so fucking glad you're not going to delete it.

601
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:12,140
Must resurg, resist urge to delete video. Okay. He looks, he looks, he looks, you go around the

602
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:23,529
tree. You go around to the right behind the tree. Okay. Got it. So you go around this way

603
02:03:23,529 --> 02:04:07,229
behind the tree. Yes. Oh fuck. Oh, that was horrible. Your stealth surprised me. You know

604
02:04:07,229 --> 02:04:13,229
the secret of my special place of meditation. If you will remain quiet, I will help you on this

605
02:04:13,229 --> 02:04:23,390
land. Oh, that was horrible. Rest assured I'll appear when needed. That is all. So what? What

606
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:35,340
did that do for me? Now kill him. I'll appear as needed. I don't get anything for that.

607
02:04:42,619 --> 02:04:52,600
I did it. Somebody said the description changed again. Read the comments. All right. I'm going

608
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:58,119
to go through the comments of this, uh, video. Sure. Uh, German sucks by the way. Let's see.

609
02:04:58,119 --> 02:05:03,340
Let's read it. Uh, short streamer. Jeremy Albertson needs guides to finish boomer game more at 10.

610
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:07,659
This is like this guy ruined hours of this person's childhood. A thousand of us get it.

611
02:05:07,659 --> 02:05:12,699
Jeremy, you short omega low. That's funny. Five one Willem Dafoe needs tutorial to move camera

612
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:16,220
correctly. That's hysterical. Derma couldn't get it right. Now you're right. Hello, ladies and

613
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:20,300
gentlemen, welcome to the German craft copper pasta. This guy may be mauled on stream. Derma

614
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:24,539
walk. You can do a German. This is a German nine eight five partner channel. Now I was here when

615
02:05:24,539 --> 02:05:28,699
he watched it. Derma Venus. Derma be like, Hmm, today we'll watch a tutorial live on stream and

616
02:05:28,699 --> 02:05:34,140
not save mega milk. This is painful. Annoying streamer ruins hours of his middle age. Thank

617
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:38,140
you for this video. Jeremy would be banging his head against the wall without it. It's true.

618
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:43,979
I can't believe mega milk died for this legendary heard that some streamer called grill master,

619
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:48,619
whatever, sudden change in description left me in tears. Derma, you're handsome. Derma's handsome.

620
02:05:48,619 --> 02:05:59,930
That's the same person. He did it. Let's read some of the comments from five years ago. Thank you.

621
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:06,079
This is from five years ago. I never could beat that mission. So it's great to actually see it

622
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:11,600
happen. It's kind of disappointing actually. Okay. What about another one from like 10 years ago?

623
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:27,279
That's it. That's it. That's the only comment. Liar making up comments. Go read them for yourself.

624
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:39,630
Sort by date. Let's go down to the end. Let's see. This is too many. One. Okay. A year ago,

625
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:45,229
five years ago. That's the only two comments. All right. Hype train initiated. All right.

626
02:06:45,229 --> 02:06:51,630
Thanks for watching that guys. Wait, did another, another hype train, another hype train has been

627
02:06:51,630 --> 02:07:03,020
initiated. Wait, what's going on? It's not doing it again, right? No. Okay. It's showing up on this

628
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:10,029
other screen. It's showing up on my Twitch dashboard now. All right. No, it's not. There's

629
02:07:10,029 --> 02:07:18,250
no hype train. Don't hype anything. Okay. Welcome back to the stream guys. That was fucking stupid.

630
02:07:20,699 --> 02:07:29,359
Let's uh, oh yeah. I had like a village that was starving. Let's go. How am I doing?

631
02:07:36,279 --> 02:07:43,159
Oh, I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore. That sucked. That actually was the worst. What was

632
02:07:43,159 --> 02:07:47,319
I doing though? I've, that was, this was an hour ago. I don't remember what I was doing.

633
02:07:48,279 --> 02:08:01,640
I was doing something important. I don't remember what that was. Breeding. Breeding. Right. Okay.

634
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:06,039
But I want some more. Oh wait. I went with my, my, the forest isn't doing anything.

635
02:08:11,869 --> 02:08:19,789
You were saving Murius. I'll get this out of here. This is going to cause a problem. It's going to

636
02:08:19,789 --> 02:08:25,399
hurt somebody. So to get rid of it. All right. I want to go take over the other village. That's

637
02:08:25,399 --> 02:08:31,529
not going to hit a village, right? You got to be fucking kidding me. That's not going to hit the

638
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:36,479
good. Okay. All right. Let's make these people believe in me. What do you say?

639
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:45,840
Let's give them some food. They look like they need it. What's the food symbol?

640
02:08:48,989 --> 02:08:55,560
I got to move in to my territory and then out to these people here that I want to give it to.

641
02:08:59,159 --> 02:09:06,439
Miracle food. Let's get some influence. Ready? Uh, terrible. Come back over here.

642
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:13,310
All right. Here we go. All right. Oh, I don't have influence. I can't

643
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:33,159
damn it. Well, you need the immortal guy. What? How many believe do I need to take this over?

644
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:43,630
419. Just make a new village. You want to make a new village right down here at the edge.

645
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:58,119
Let me get this situated though. What happened here? What happened here? Wood. All right. What

646
02:09:58,119 --> 02:10:07,930
we got anymore? Yeah. Let's put it. Let's make another settlement down here and it's time to

647
02:10:07,930 --> 02:10:20,939
breed. Let's get some children. Did the trees grow? Um, they did not. They did not. Well,

648
02:10:27,579 --> 02:10:47,079
time just to harvest them. Don't worry. We'll get them back. I can't believe I took that long

649
02:10:47,079 --> 02:11:09,640
to do that. There's a miracle over here. Let's get that one. We can't believe it either. Well,

650
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:16,520
that guy is apparently important. I can't just not do anything with that guy. Physical shield.

651
02:11:26,119 --> 02:11:34,560
I don't need that right now. Physical shield. All right. What if I give it to them?

652
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:47,039
Here. Oh, well, how do I cancel? Can I drop this? I don't want to. I don't want to use this.

653
02:11:48,159 --> 02:12:00,699
I'm gonna sneeze. That couldn't be. I don't want this. Drop. Press you. No, you said bless you.

654
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:12,409
Who am I connected to? I don't want this. I actually don't want to shake it. There we go.

655
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:27,500
All right. It's time to breed. You. Breed. We need breeding. Breed. Disciple breeder. More.

656
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:44,109
We need children. Disciple breeder. More children. Who else? You're hurting them.

657
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:56,800
I'm not hurting anybody. I am not hurting anyone. I'm trying to get them to breed.

658
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:05,979
Disciple breeder. Disciple breeder. Thank you. Okay. Children are starting to come out. We have

659
02:13:05,979 --> 02:13:21,960
enough place to live. Do need a little bit more wood, which there's some in here. And when that's

660
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:30,989
done, I gotta go this way. Which way should I go? This little area down here. Tons of trees over

661
02:13:30,989 --> 02:13:53,640
here. In fact, I'm gonna harvest them. I need to. Play music for the right mood. This is kind of

662
02:13:53,800 --> 02:14:05,159
the right mood. My buddy is gone. All right. Let's go. More food. Miracle food. People still

663
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:20,460
worshiping. Yeah, they are. They're getting tired though. 12,000 food. 11,000 wood. That should be

664
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:26,859
enough for now. Have some kids. Breed. And then I have to make this town. I have to influence this

665
02:14:26,859 --> 02:14:33,659
town. What do you think? Maybe another little center here? Oops. I didn't want to do that.

666
02:14:41,149 --> 02:14:46,699
You need a lot more breeders. I mean, I kind of, but I don't want to do too much.

667
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:52,060
What are they doing? Going home. Steve Jackson's going to sleep.

668
02:14:53,180 --> 02:15:06,329
Disciple breeder. More. We need more kids. We need a worship site. Our population, seriously,

669
02:15:06,329 --> 02:15:20,109
is not doing so well. Going to the forest? Is this still not built? How the fuck is this not

670
02:15:20,109 --> 02:15:36,439
built? Everyone's like 70 plus years old. Better start having kids. Okay. Build two more houses.

671
02:15:36,439 --> 02:15:44,409
We can live in these damn things. You were gone for 10 years. Yeah. Well, I had to figure out

672
02:15:44,409 --> 02:15:57,399
some things. Build it. Are there, what about the, okay, let's go to the temple. This is about

673
02:15:57,399 --> 02:16:18,239
eight women up here. I think so. Are there? Okay. We need some breeding. Breed. 76 years old.

674
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:37,100
I'm going to have my first child at 80. Can I? Disciple breeder. Okay. Good. We have to have

675
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:50,489
kids. Start having kids before the whole village gets wiped out. 68, 85. All right. Well, let's

676
02:16:50,489 --> 02:17:05,950
just, wait, I think that was, I think that was a female. Fuck. How old was she? I just like,

677
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:12,829
oh God. Okay. Come here. Disciple breeder. What am I doing? I'm trying to make kids. Everybody's 80

678
02:17:12,829 --> 02:17:23,319
and everyone's going to die. Did you even read chat? What are you talking about? What are you

679
02:17:23,319 --> 02:17:33,420
talking about? The average age of people in this village is 75 years old. I have to make kids.

680
02:17:35,629 --> 02:17:41,290
Use a pregnancy miracle. I don't have that. You're talking about stuff that's potentially like

681
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:43,129
six levels into the game.

682
02:17:55,309 --> 02:18:07,209
All these kids are going to be messed up. Why are they having kids? All right. Get in the temple.

683
02:18:07,209 --> 02:18:30,479
I need to see what's going on here. I need a better picture. Oh, 73% male. There are

684
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:47,389
222 people. More than an insane majority of men. Breeders. This is bad. Okay. What does my,

685
02:18:48,350 --> 02:19:00,909
what's my creature have to say? I'm greedy. I'm tired. I think my God's on the good side.

686
02:19:00,909 --> 02:19:10,649
I want to think about the creature Chugworth. He is totally evil. Who is Chugworth? The guy

687
02:19:10,649 --> 02:19:24,030
torturing him? This guy torturing me is totally evil. Chugworth is such a cool name.

688
02:19:25,319 --> 02:19:29,579
What's Murius? Murius is a good name too. Let's take a look at this.

689
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:41,930
All right. I got to start influencing because I wish I just had my guy. You know what I mean?

690
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:47,260
If I had my guy, I'd be fine, but I don't. All right. Get me out of here.

691
02:19:51,739 --> 02:20:04,940
This is the room where you. Well, you could influence it or you could follow a Yogi for 60

692
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:12,139
years, but that's, that's probably going to come back to be a good thing. I would assume it has to

693
02:20:12,139 --> 02:20:21,100
be right. All right. Time to build. I need wood. I need to build like a, what should I build?

694
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:31,049
Like a new town center down there. What do you think? What should I put down there to put my,

695
02:20:31,049 --> 02:20:49,000
to put some influence? Almost out of wood. There's no kids either. I have to, all right,

696
02:20:49,000 --> 02:21:05,159
I got to use the actor. Where is he? Come here. Look at what I have. Interesting, huh?

697
02:21:08,489 --> 02:21:37,260
It's cool. I know I'm shaking a guy around in front of you. You didn't kill me. Oops.

698
02:21:40,409 --> 02:21:48,319
Please don't throw me. Oh, cast some miracles in here while he's running around. Good idea.

699
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:54,489
All right. Let's do a food. Let's give him food. Oh, you big boy. Try it again. And you're

700
02:21:55,049 --> 02:22:11,229
dead. Food. Yeah. Food in here. Look. Please don't throw me my leg. You want more food?

701
02:22:12,829 --> 02:22:20,200
There's much more where that came from. Oh, you big bully. Try it again. And you're dead. Look

702
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:31,920
what I got. Look at that. Huh? Cool. Huh? Want some more? I need 300 belief. Please don't throw me

703
02:22:32,639 --> 02:22:48,350
on my arm. I got more miracles. I've got more miracles. Get off me. Oh, my head. Throw some

704
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:56,799
fireballs around. No, no, no. I need influence, not fear. I do not. I want influence. I do not

705
02:22:56,799 --> 02:23:17,290
want fear. Oh, oh, you big bully. Try it again. And you're dead. Wow. 280 belief. Come on. Let me,

706
02:23:17,290 --> 02:23:24,399
let me, like, look, I pick up a tree and like do this. It's crazy, huh? Look at this. Look at

707
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:32,840
that shit. Cool, huh? Leave it. I'm not worth it. Miracle food. I'm trying to grab him. Please

708
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:43,739
don't throw me my leg. He's not worth it. He is because he lets me interact with this town.

709
02:23:48,840 --> 02:24:03,290
You didn't kill me. All right. How much did I get for that? 251. I think I have to kill somebody.

710
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:19,079
Where'd he go? Please don't please don't throw me. I'm gonna hit somebody with this. Eventually.

711
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:27,639
Oh, my eye. That's a new line. Put him on the sacrificial altar. Hold on. Oh, you big bully.

712
02:24:27,639 --> 02:24:32,680
Put one of your guys in the village. Get off me. Oh, you big bully. All right. Well, I have to put.

713
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:47,159
All right. Here we go. Who am I putting in there? Um, you. Somebody from my village. Oh, you big

714
02:24:47,159 --> 02:24:54,590
bully. Try it again and you're dead. What did I just do? Did I just make him? No, no, no, no. Don't.

715
02:24:54,590 --> 02:25:11,920
I want to. What does that mean? Is he like a. Did they just capture him? Did I make him into wood?

716
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:18,159
No, I didn't. Look, he's like talking. I think he just. Did he just breed? Who? Wait, where is he?

717
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:47,399
Is that them? Oh, it is. He's going around. He's. He's breeding. Right? Yeah. I infected them. Where's

718
02:25:47,399 --> 02:26:01,209
he going? All right. I still need. Let me go back to my town. I have a lot of food. OK, let's build.

719
02:26:01,209 --> 02:26:09,120
What do I want? There's a fucking shitload of food. OK, bigger house, civic building.

720
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:18,829
What should I do? Should I do a new village center or should I just do another place to live?

721
02:26:21,159 --> 02:26:28,750
The soccer field is broken and it does not work, apparently. Make a graveyard. Change him to a

722
02:26:28,750 --> 02:27:04,110
missionary. Hold on. Where's my guy that I throw for it to be able to interact? My head. OK, we're

723
02:27:04,110 --> 02:27:12,750
in. We're in. You didn't kill me. Get off. Get off me. So where did my. Where did my guy go?

724
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:20,489
Is he just in here breeding in the village still? All right, I'm going to make a missionary.

725
02:27:21,209 --> 02:27:34,700
I can't. I have no access to the snow. There he is. Wait, what are you doing? Try it again and

726
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:39,129
you're dead. I don't have enough influence over there. You've got to stay over here.

727
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:51,979
So this is weird. I don't think this is the kind of dumb way to do this. Oh, my head is built down

728
02:27:51,979 --> 02:27:57,209
here because I can't put him over there unless I have access to be over here, which I don't have

729
02:27:57,209 --> 02:28:05,000
access to be over here. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and please don't throw me like this guy has

730
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:13,389
to be standing in this village. My leg. OK, I have to grab somebody and put him in here

731
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:26,090
because I cannot do anything in this town unless there's positive. I'm cheating the system right

732
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:34,299
now. Essentially, it was what's happening. All right. You, Jeff Keighley, Jeff Keighley,

733
02:28:34,299 --> 02:28:41,500
you are now going to be a missionary. What does it look like over here on the temple

734
02:28:42,299 --> 02:29:00,649
on their temple? They don't have one, do they? On top of a person. Does it have to be a person

735
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:19,530
because the breeding is next to a house? OK, God damn it. Please don't. This guy has to be

736
02:29:19,530 --> 02:29:40,559
over here. What the fuck? OK. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. OK, Jeff Keighley,

737
02:29:40,559 --> 02:29:55,879
come here. So was that like Zen symbol? Correct. Could I do it here? Disciple missionary. There he

738
02:29:55,879 --> 02:30:14,760
is. He's going to change. What's going on in here? All right. Jeff Keighley is now. He's a

739
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:24,350
missionary. OK, I still need 226 believe flying, flying, flying. What happened? What did you guys

740
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:40,120
do? I died. What did they do? I can't even help them. Jesus. All right. All right. I got a

741
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:45,159
missionary. I got to go back to my town. I'm going to build something down here. I can take

742
02:30:45,159 --> 02:31:00,079
anything. How are we doing on kids? Very important. Fuck. Somebody else died. Do we even have any

743
02:31:00,079 --> 02:31:22,159
children? Aren't these any kids? Is it no kids? I got to get some breeding done now. You need

744
02:31:22,159 --> 02:31:37,389
women have to be 45 or under to breed. Well, this town's gone. Hopefully Jeff Keighley does

745
02:31:37,389 --> 02:31:48,780
something over there. Otherwise, this is actually fucking ruined. Everybody's 80. Oh no, it's over.

746
02:31:51,159 --> 02:32:02,120
Steal people from the other village. Everyone over here is fucking ancient too.

747
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:12,729
Everybody look at how old everybody is. 60, 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 70. Why are we so old? 20. OK,

748
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:24,299
hold on. Give me a break. Come on. This dude's going to die of old age. I got to get him. Oh,

749
02:32:24,299 --> 02:32:36,969
that sucks. I spent 60 years following the stupid guy on the cliff. Oh, help. Oh, God.

750
02:32:47,069 --> 02:33:00,170
No, you didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Where the fuck am I? Speaking of missionaries,

751
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:05,770
time to go find some people to bring back to my town. And I don't know, I guess.

752
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:21,399
You didn't get off. Get off me. 84. Who are you? Oh, you big bully. Try it again.

753
02:33:21,399 --> 02:33:29,100
I don't know who this person is. OK, got you. You are on my team now. You live here now.

754
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:52,829
You live here now. Deciding what to do. You live here now. 20. No. Live here in love.

755
02:33:52,829 --> 02:34:18,379
Good. How do I speed this up? All my eye. I need people under 45. I'll get a few of them.

756
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:26,879
Oh, you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. 83. We need younger than that. Please don't throw

757
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:54,540
me. 75. 21. You can kill me. You live here now. Live here in love. Good. OK. All right. Where's

758
02:34:54,540 --> 02:35:14,909
the other 21 year old? 21. I think everybody's dead. 21. There you are. Come here. Disciple

759
02:35:14,909 --> 02:35:27,739
breeder. Help me. Disciple breeder. We need children. We need children. Don't go to the

760
02:35:27,739 --> 02:35:43,450
worship site. We need kids. I have to turn it off. Breed. Together. All right. We need a couple more.

761
02:35:51,479 --> 02:36:10,120
Um, 44, 45, 21. 21. OK. Where's my actor? All right. How did I speed this up? Somebody

762
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:33,799
tell me I can speed this up. Alt and 2. You big bully. Please don't throw me.

763
02:36:39,389 --> 02:36:47,389
You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,

764
02:36:48,030 --> 02:37:07,760
30. Oh, you big bully. Try it again. You have to live here. You have to live here. We need more

765
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:18,670
people. Good. OK. Disciple breeder. Disciple breeder. You're 76. Not going to work. I didn't

766
02:37:18,670 --> 02:37:21,709
mean to do that. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't

767
02:37:21,709 --> 02:37:37,930
mean to do that. 22. Come here. OK. These are two. These are women. All right. Women, women, women.

768
02:37:38,010 --> 02:37:58,520
Where's the other guy? There he is. Put that down. All right. Did you do it? They're both going into

769
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:27,260
the same hut to give birth. Oh, this is weird. Oh, kids, kids. Come here. More. Where are those

770
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:36,879
kids? Where are they? I don't see any. Oh, this hole. Everybody's going to be related.

771
02:38:41,149 --> 02:38:43,069
Everybody's going to be related.

772
02:38:49,479 --> 02:39:04,090
Oh, no. Oh, boy. Here we go. No. Where are they? We need kids. Oh, they don't have any babies.

773
02:39:04,889 --> 02:39:29,739
I need to steal more people. No. I have to do it before this guy dies. It takes a minute to give

774
02:39:29,739 --> 02:40:01,450
birth. OK. Let's get another. You didn't kill me. 46, 85, 23. This place is vacant. What's wrong with

775
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:26,559
it? It doesn't need to be repaired. What are you talking about? OK. Now you breed. Disciple breeder.

776
02:40:26,559 --> 02:40:52,000
OK. Good. One more. I need another female. Oh, hell. I think I broke it. My arm. Oh, you please

777
02:40:52,000 --> 02:41:06,700
don't throw me. OK. This is it. And this should be fine. God damn it. Oh, you big bully. Try it

778
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:32,280
again and you're dead. OK. We need one more person. 60, 60, 23. Wow. Whoa. Dead. Looks

779
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:56,969
like the spot for you to move in. Live here in love. All right. Breed. Breed. You too. Breed.

780
02:41:56,969 --> 02:42:07,079
Breed. Breeder. You're already a breeder. I need. Giving birth. Yes. Our first child. Yes.

781
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:24,909
Don't kill them. I just don't kill them. Don't die. Don't be dead. Don't be dead. I need you. I

782
02:42:24,909 --> 02:42:38,569
need a fucking. These are the only people in the town. OK. I need one more person. Live here in

783
02:42:38,569 --> 02:42:47,069
love. I need another male. Oh, my God. I fucking can't believe I have to do this. Is there any

784
02:42:47,069 --> 02:42:53,479
people over here? 70, 70, 70, 60, 60, 60, 80, 80. No, they're all gone. What about over here?

785
02:42:54,280 --> 02:43:04,110
24. Convert the village. I mean, I can't unless I can. I can't get over there for long enough.

786
02:43:04,750 --> 02:43:14,040
I think it's going to be fine. Everybody over here is going to be a breeder.

787
02:43:15,959 --> 02:43:25,069
There it is. OK. 24, 24, 1, 1. OK. We're having births. 24. Breeder. All right. You.

788
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:31,549
No more of that. You breed. No more. No, no. You're 74. Actually, you keep. You do that. That's fine.

789
02:43:32,750 --> 02:43:35,870
I don't want you doing that. I want you breeding. And that's it.

790
02:43:36,430 --> 02:44:07,290
Disciple Forester. Good. Good. Breeder. Breeder. Good. 73. Going home. OK. I'm pretty sure

791
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:13,770
everybody is now breeding with each other. Remember, the old can also breed.

792
02:44:13,770 --> 02:44:23,530
I thought you guys don't know they couldn't. Disciple Breeder.

793
02:44:26,809 --> 02:44:40,170
I'm trying to make offspring. One guy killed the colony.

794
02:44:42,969 --> 02:44:49,049
Yeah, because I had to follow around this dude, which, by the way, if I was supposed to follow

795
02:44:49,049 --> 02:45:00,459
that person around, that takes 10, 20, 30 years. Well, going home, going home, giving birth. OK.

796
02:45:00,459 --> 02:45:06,350
We got another baby. I think we're going to be in the clear for a while. You don't go to the forest

797
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:26,170
for wood. Only breed. No one do anything else but breed. Anything. Disciple Breeder. OK. Don't do

798
02:45:26,170 --> 02:45:35,819
anything but have children. There we go. All right. I think they will populate themselves now.

799
02:45:36,379 --> 02:45:52,969
We need wood. There's some down here. They're all going to have the same birthday.

800
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:05,610
That's pretty fucked up. That's pretty fucked up. Yeah. Yeah, it's fucked up.

801
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:17,610
Heal the villagers. They're all under 50% health.

802
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:58,799
OK. One more. Over here. Nobody's worshipping, right? No, they can't. They can't because they

803
02:46:58,799 --> 02:47:17,120
need to breed. Make them have, no. Having children. Breeding. I see a lot more names. That's good.

804
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:29,629
More kids. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's what I like to see. More.

805
02:47:30,350 --> 02:47:33,579
I need to do another heal though. How do I get another heal?

806
02:47:37,149 --> 02:47:42,010
65%. Someone's got to go up here. OK. Is there anybody that's over the age of 60?

807
02:47:56,030 --> 02:48:12,879
All right. Who needs help? You guys down here. 90, 40, 70, 60, 70, 70. 75%. All right. That's good.

808
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:23,739
All right. Everyone's OK. We're good. Maybe I should steal some more people.

809
02:48:23,739 --> 02:48:44,319
The actor. He's dead. All right. What do they got? 49, 10, 10. OK. There's somebody 38. I can't.

810
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:50,379
I need 78 belief. All right. Let's just go trash the place until they love me.

811
02:48:52,590 --> 02:49:09,000
You know what I mean? Let's just trash the place until they like me. No. Don't crash. I'm not doing

812
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:18,120
that again. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. All right. Look what I can do, guys.

813
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:31,530
You didn't kill me. Cool, huh? Get off me. Oh, hell. I wonder if he's going to die of an old age.

814
02:49:32,329 --> 02:49:42,909
There's got to be it. Come on. Like I need like 20 more. Look, the miracle of something. You didn't

815
02:49:42,909 --> 02:49:59,239
kill me. 12. That's a kid. Put the kid down. All right. How much more? 32? Damn it. Where is he?

816
02:49:59,239 --> 02:50:12,489
Stop running away. Please don't throw me. The miracle of throwing the same guy into the ground.

817
02:50:12,489 --> 02:50:19,229
I know. Why am I throwing this person? Because it gains belief points. Oh, my eye. Oh, you big

818
02:50:19,229 --> 02:50:29,899
bully. Try it. Get off. Get off me. Do you believe me now, please? No. Once I have this village,

819
02:50:29,899 --> 02:50:42,079
I'll be good to go. Heal the actor. Okay, here we go. How much more do I need? You didn't kill me.

820
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:57,450
How do you not believe me yet? You having fun anymore? I still am, strangely enough,

821
02:50:57,450 --> 02:51:05,370
after all this nonsense. All right, let's go. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and you're dead.

822
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:11,790
How much more belief? 31 belief. Oops. Catch, catch. I got it. Okay, I'm fine.

823
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:23,879
Please don't throw me. Okay, time to do a miracle. Oh, my head. Miracle time. Heal.

824
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:31,069
Oh, you big bully. Please don't throw me. Oh, you big bully. Please don't throw me.

825
02:51:32,270 --> 02:51:43,319
I just need like 30 fucking. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and you're dead.

826
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:58,200
Believe. Believe. God. Please don't. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me.

827
02:51:59,370 --> 02:52:05,129
You big bully. I don't have any miracles. Please don't throw me. Oh, my head. I can't wait to never

828
02:52:05,129 --> 02:52:14,750
have to throw this guy again. I have to just deposit food over here. Oh, you big bully.

829
02:52:14,750 --> 02:52:24,159
Got it. Try it again and you're dead. Get off. Get off me. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and

830
02:52:24,159 --> 02:52:53,639
you're dead. Oh, my fucking God. Where is he? Please don't throw me. You didn't kill me.

831
02:52:57,079 --> 02:53:05,959
Please don't throw me. I don't want to hear this dude ever again. I need 20 belief. I've given them

832
02:53:05,959 --> 02:53:14,780
food. I've thrown people. I've destroyed things. How do I get this? Just 20 fucking belief.

833
02:53:16,219 --> 02:53:20,379
Save the cow. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Do you understand the cow is across

834
02:53:20,379 --> 02:53:48,569
the entire game? I can't even. I can't get over there. I have to. This is somehow taking more

835
02:53:48,569 --> 02:53:54,840
time than following the yogi around. Doesn't building get you more influence? You didn't kill

836
02:53:54,840 --> 02:54:01,079
me. That's what I thought too. But I look at how much. I'm going to try building one building over

837
02:54:01,079 --> 02:54:20,639
here. Just give me the fucking thing. Right at the edge. Somebody build the damn thing. Build that.

838
02:54:20,719 --> 02:54:31,149
Disciple builder. Because I can't do anything over here until I have sacrificed somebody for a

839
02:54:31,149 --> 02:54:44,540
miracle. I God damn it, man. Look at all these children. The problem was following the yogi.

840
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:48,139
Following the yogi was the dumbest thing to ever do. It just deleted 60 years.

841
02:54:55,610 --> 02:55:01,850
Walking behind. I had save points and shit. That took like 70 fucking years to walk behind that

842
02:55:01,850 --> 02:55:17,069
guy slowly. I got to sacrifice somebody for a miracle. Destroy a house in the village with a

843
02:55:17,069 --> 02:55:27,920
rock. I tried to throw like a tree at their wall. All right. Give me a rock. Fuck it. Let's go.

844
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:40,299
I don't even know where that went. I have no idea where that just went. I need the actor again

845
02:55:40,299 --> 02:55:50,700
to do that. Oh my God. He's going to die of old age. This is so stupid.

846
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:59,799
Oh, you please don't throw me. Oh, you pick it up. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me.

847
02:55:59,799 --> 02:56:06,520
Oh, you please don't throw me. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. You didn't kill me.

848
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:13,399
You have a rock in your village anywhere. I need a boulder. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and

849
02:56:13,399 --> 02:56:26,399
you're dead. That's it. Fuck you. Finally. Jesus God. You didn't kill me.

850
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:42,600
We almost have our cow back. All this pain.

851
02:56:55,200 --> 02:57:06,569
All right. God damn it. My influence has grown. Now let's do this. Everybody. Everybody start

852
02:57:06,569 --> 02:57:14,250
working together. How are we doing? We have another village over here. I have influence right there.

853
02:57:15,129 --> 02:57:23,610
We need breeding now. Breathe together. Live here in peace. What's going on?

854
02:57:24,090 --> 02:57:32,170
I is dead. I have your creature and you still dare to oppose me.

855
02:57:33,610 --> 02:57:46,680
The cow's been frozen for 100 years. I see some of your minions have strayed. What? Behold wrath.

856
02:57:46,680 --> 02:58:04,639
What? No. I can't let this happen. I don't have a water spell. I don't have a water spell.

857
02:58:07,239 --> 02:58:14,760
No. There he is. Save us, please. Please. You took all of them.

858
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:23,239
That's all you're going to give me is two water miracles? Thanks for nothing.

859
02:58:23,639 --> 02:59:06,760
Stop lighting each other on fire. They're reigniting each other. Okay. We good? Vagrant.

860
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:13,040
Okay. So did I just get a shitload of people? Oh my God. They're all 18.

861
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:17,600
Oh my God. They're all 18. They're all 18. They're all 18. All of them are 18.

862
02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:29,239
I just broke something. That just saved everything. Oh my God. They're migrating everywhere. Okay. Here

863
02:59:29,239 --> 02:59:42,920
we go. Saved. Saved. Yes. Yes. All right. We need breeders. Let's go. Chop chop. Start having kids.

864
02:59:48,350 --> 03:00:02,799
Don't kill anybody. Our followers are annoyed with you. Just start working. Disciple farmer.

865
03:00:02,799 --> 03:00:09,600
Farmers. Disciple farmer. Get a couple of builders. Disciple farmer. Why are they 70? Oh,

866
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:22,440
it's Jeff Keely. 54. 2. 53. Okay. We need we need breeders. I need all the young ones to breed

867
03:00:23,319 --> 03:00:37,899
and all the old ones to work. Like that mechanic. Seriously. Give me a break. Breed.

868
03:00:38,780 --> 03:00:58,489
What the hell do you think I'm doing? He's already a breeder? What? All right. Where are all the 18

869
03:00:58,489 --> 03:01:08,959
year olds? Going to building site. No. No. You should be breeding. You should be breeding. Do

871
03:01:36,170 --> 03:01:42,809

872
03:01:42,809 --> 03:01:52,600
to have some wood cutters. My influence has grown this way. Any uh there's a couple is there any

873
03:01:52,600 --> 03:02:03,959
women over here? 78. 19. Going to the store. Okay. This town is in trouble. Oh, hold on.

Disciple forester. Yeah, that's fine. Woodcutter. Disciple forester. All right. Looking good.

875
03:02:16,879 --> 03:02:20,319
There's this other town over here. The influence is at least close enough where I can

876
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:26,000
all right. Here we go. It's time to put some people on that side. Let's let's get some

877
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:33,959
missionaries. You. Well, you're bad at chopping trees. Really bad.

878

Come over here. Spread our good word. Disciple missionary. Missionary. Let's get a few over

879
03:02:45,840 --> 03:03:07,229

880
03:03:08,879 --> 03:03:19,239
Did that just tick down or I don't understand? Come on. I can take anything you throw. Quiet.

881
03:03:19,959 --> 03:03:28,459
All right. Good. We're working in the fields here. How much wood do I got? Plenty of food,

882
03:03:28,459 --> 03:03:36,799
but I need more wood. You know, there's a whole forest down here. I need like a wood cutting shop.

883
03:03:36,799 --> 03:03:49,600
Look at all these kids. Perfect. All right. Building sites. Leaping. I think we can take

884
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:59,709
some people away now. You. We need to start cutting this shit down. Disciple forester.

885

We have to make some people do some work over there. Building site. No. All the 55 plus.

You're over here getting wood. 55 plus. Where are you? Disciple forester. Okay. Anyone 55 plus? 79.

887
03:04:34,170 --> 03:04:45,000
Disciple. What the fuck? This is dystopian. What are they doing down here? Somebody died.

888
03:04:48,299 --> 03:04:59,440
Oh no. Jeff Keely's going to the farm. No. Catch them. It's okay. Breathe. No. Cut wood.

889
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:13,950
They're going a really long way to bring that wood. Okay. We're going to start to need food

890
03:05:13,950 --> 03:05:18,350
and shit. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Too much. Now the breeding's

894
03:05:51,930 --> 03:05:57,690
kids? Breeder. Okay. We don't want you doing that anymore. Stop kissing each other. Stop.

Going to the forest for wood. Going to the farm. Going to the farm. Going to the forest.

Wizard of the Breeder. Going to farm. Going to farm. Going to village. Breeder. Okay.

900
03:06:44,479 --> 03:06:56,840
That's enough. Disciple builder. We need more builders. We need more farms too. Okay. Uh, we.

I need wood. I got people working on the wood. Going to the store. Going to the building.

902
03:07:01,719 --> 03:07:06,760
Digging up a crop. Going to the store. Why are they all going this way? Why are you going so far away?

903
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:25,790
No. Stop working over here. Disciple farmer. How old do they have to be? Breeder. What's that noise?

904
03:07:27,399 --> 03:07:35,659
Getting wood. No. Uh, over here. Disciple farmer. I need a store in, in the capital.

905
03:07:36,299 --> 03:07:45,260
What do you mean? Do they not? That's not. Isn't that a store right here? I. There's a store there

906
03:07:45,260 --> 03:07:59,049
and a store here. That's because you're splitting up families. How are they doing on wood? Wood is

907
03:07:59,049 --> 03:08:11,370
always in trouble. I'm going to take some. Offspring. All right. I'm going to take it.

908
03:08:11,930 --> 03:08:21,959
Okay. Going to crates. Going to crates. So many kids. Oh no. There's too many kids.

There's too many children now. Oh God. This is not good. How do I need three wood for that?

Disciple forester. So everyone's going, going to village store. Why are they going this far away?

912
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:16,120
They need kids over here. Offspring. I know. I'm trying to figure that out. You need kids over here?

03:10:21,120 --> 03:10:27,200
How do you think about that? Huh? What about that for food? Huh? What about this?

03:14:57,079 --> 03:15:05,440

942
03:16:08,510 --> 03:16:31,680
Here to make the sick feel better. 57 belief. How much more do I need? 200. What a kind ruler.

943
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:40,649
Are you guys doing porn? Stop doing porn. I will actually start, I will start throwing out

03:17:28,989 --> 03:17:43,799
Miracle food. It's warm food. Isn't that a good thing? How's that a bad thing? Who can I sacrifice?

948
03:17:46,190 --> 03:18:02,649
838, 3, 18, 25, 7, 49, 75. And what is that over there I can do?

949
03:18:06,350 --> 03:18:10,510
What does that do? That's lightning and then often some defense or something.

950
03:18:11,149 --> 03:18:19,049
I'm going to put some food in. I'm going to put it over here. They really actually need it.

951
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:37,690
Chat needs cow. I'm working on it. I'm trying. I'm trying. How much more do I need?

952
03:18:38,329 --> 03:18:48,270

953
03:18:48,270 --> 03:19:17,639
somebody. How much more? Go faster. Yeah, I can't. 116 belief needed. Kill two more people.

955
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:39,239
that I have to take over the next two towns to save the cow. That's the only way I can do it.

956
03:19:39,239 --> 03:20:02,000
I'm trying. 8 belief. Almost there. 72 needed. All right, what are we doing over here?

957
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:12,590
How many points do you need to save the cow? I need to do the take over every single town here

958
03:20:13,549 --> 03:20:23,040
to get up to here to then release my fucking cow who for some reason they decided to have this

959
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:29,920
level be a thing where you don't get your creature you just got. He's just stuck up there while you

960
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:38,569
have to breed. All right, we need a mercenary. We're not a mercenary. Whatever it's called.

961
03:20:39,530 --> 03:20:49,280
The gorilla wouldn't have let himself get captured. You don't know that.

962
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:56,780
Offspring, offspring, offspring. Where are we going? Right here. How old is everybody?

963
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:03,799
I mean theoretically speaking, it'll get easier when I get this other town here.

964
03:21:09,389 --> 03:21:21,930
Disciple missionary. 57 belief. Come on. Hurry up. Somebody do something. It's got a heart when they

965
03:21:21,930 --> 03:21:30,959
hit the dirt. 12 belief. Just make a miracle. I've done that and it gives you like 10.

966
03:21:31,840 --> 03:21:35,549
I think it's time to throw a fucking fireball at this village. Who cares?

967
03:21:38,809 --> 03:21:46,670
It's time. It's time to throw a fireball at the village. I'm not going to like throw a guy over

968
03:21:46,670 --> 03:21:52,670
there or like pour maple syrup in their fucking coffers. No, it's time. It's time to die.

969
03:21:58,620 --> 03:22:10,540
It's time to die. Maybe you'll fucking listen now. We rained hell down on him.

970
03:22:23,629 --> 03:22:31,959
Are they believing yet? Oh shit. Now I need water. Now I need water.

971
03:22:34,040 --> 03:22:39,739
I need to sacrifice somebody quick. Sacrifice somebody. Sacrifice somebody. Somebody. Somebody.

972
03:22:39,739 --> 03:22:47,260
Somebody. Somebody. Somebody. Somebody. Somebody. Anybody. Come here. What are you

973
03:22:47,260 --> 03:23:07,209
talking about? You're not even here. Miracle shower. Oh my God. The camera is going to drive

974
03:23:07,209 --> 03:23:30,120
me insane. I can't even. I'm living the window. I brought water. See? I'm helping you.

975
03:23:32,360 --> 03:23:36,200
All right. Now all of you go fuck yourself. All of you. I don't care about this village.

976
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:50,760
This village sucks. Give me my cow back. I just want to play the game. The fun game with the cow

977
03:23:50,760 --> 03:24:06,719
and the people. Hard locking me out of my favorite part of the game. All right. Let's go. This is the

978
03:24:06,719 --> 03:24:16,059
village right here. I got to get up there. Is anything still on fire? See? Look. I'm good now.

979
03:24:20,479 --> 03:24:31,280
Okay. We're good. We have a lot of influence here. I lose influence over here.

980
03:24:35,340 --> 03:24:39,020
What about over here? Is this a town or anything or no?

981
03:24:41,979 --> 03:24:46,700
Tree puzzle. The idea is to make the nine trees the same species. Pick up any of the trees to

982
03:24:46,780 --> 03:24:55,450
swap its species. Make it have the same one? What the fuck is this?

983
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:25,159
How many different trees are there? It's a Nancy Drew puzzle. Yeah, it is.

984
03:25:26,680 --> 03:25:33,799
But okay. How many are there? Let's see me count. One, two, three. There's three different trees.

985
03:25:34,360 --> 03:25:41,399
What's after the Christmas tree? This one. Okay. Go on. Chuck me about. I dare you.

986
03:25:59,149 --> 03:26:23,260
Please don't pick me up. Throw me around. You think I care? I don't. I don't. I don't care.

987
03:26:23,260 --> 03:26:34,649
I don't care. I'm not doing that. I'm wasting time. Who cares? No, I don't care. I'm not sitting

988
03:26:34,649 --> 03:26:42,000
there for 20 years following a guy around. No. All right. You guys get wood. Look at all the wood

989
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:55,000
that's over there. That's what I want everyone over here to do. Wood. I'm wasting a fucking

990
03:26:55,000 --> 03:27:13,120
million years. Let's get these ones too. I can actually do this too.

991
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:21,979
Because this is a huge forest. Let's just do this. Look at how many trees are over here.

992
03:27:24,010 --> 03:27:36,760
An insane amount. This can feed everybody. What? Am I taking the whole forest? What the hell?

993
03:27:38,110 --> 03:27:59,610
It's shrinking piece by piece. Oh Jesus. Okay. Almost a 20,000. All right. Let's make a...

994
03:27:59,610 --> 03:28:08,510
What do I want to make? This is the edge of my influence. I kind of need to make... Who's

995
03:28:08,510 --> 03:28:13,309
going home? All right. I got to build a building up here. Maybe a house or something.

996
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:26,829
All right. Where's the production yard? Wood required. Seven wood. Disciple builder.

997
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:31,760
Bro the guy again. I'm not doing that again.

998
03:28:34,959 --> 03:28:42,159
You may have your few believers, but I can still command the beasts of the wilderness.

999
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:51,479
He's sending animals to attack us. Is it a bunch of raccoons? Oh wait.

1000
03:28:52,120 --> 03:28:59,149
It seems you have need of me. The wolves are possessed, but I think I can help you.

1001
03:28:59,709 --> 03:29:05,639
I will try to destroy some of the wolves. Can you destroy them all? Okay. Did you...

1002
03:29:06,680 --> 03:29:12,889
Do we have any defense or anything? I need a rock. I need a rock. I need something.

1003
03:29:13,770 --> 03:29:27,209
Where are they? Oh fuck. I need something. Pause the game. We need worship right now

1004
03:29:28,010 --> 03:29:41,000
because I need like fireballs and shit. I need lightning. Everybody worship. Which

1005
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:47,629
one has the lightning in it? This one does. Okay. It's time. And that's this town here.

1006
03:29:48,430 --> 03:29:53,959
All right everybody. I need some of you to stop what you're doing. I need like a 45%.

1007
03:29:53,959 --> 03:30:00,520
Everybody. Lightning. It's 98%. Kill somebody quick.

1008
03:30:18,750 --> 03:30:23,549
Wolves have reached the village. Stop. Let me fucking do it. Are you kidding me?

1009
03:30:24,809 --> 03:30:43,280
You've got to be fucking kidding me. I can't even believe that this would happen.

1010
03:30:43,920 --> 03:30:48,000
Like that is unbelievable that that would be in the game.

1011
03:30:53,370 --> 03:31:09,049
A wolf came over. They attacked with wolves. A wolf got into the town

1012
03:31:09,049 --> 03:31:27,610
and now I lost the entire city. What was the last save? I'm not doing that. That's bogus.

1013
03:31:27,610 --> 03:31:41,159
That's actually fucking bogus. That's bogus. The true meaning of that word.

1014
03:31:41,879 --> 03:32:02,940
Now I want to spin. Get me out of here. What a pointless room. Where's the save game room?

1015
03:32:03,959 --> 03:32:11,159
I can't. Oh sire. A wolf got into the capital. Every single fucking person has turned.

1016
03:32:12,520 --> 03:32:20,299
What time is it? Five nine. That's wait. That's like a million years ago.

1017
03:32:21,579 --> 03:32:26,909
No no no. Don't delete it. Just get me back. I can't fucking believe it.

1018
03:32:31,950 --> 03:32:54,190
252 can i leave this goddamn place i'm actually angry just retake the village

1019
03:32:54,190 --> 03:33:08,120

1020
03:33:10,809 --> 03:33:19,120
what the fuck are you i am i see am i am i am i am i the corrective lenses here

1021
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:33,370

1022
03:33:33,370 --> 03:33:44,399
Nah, I, you know, no way. I can't, that's unbelievable.

1023
03:33:44,399 --> 03:34:01,819
Is there any cheats here? That took so much time to get it and it's removed in five seconds.

1024
03:34:01,819 --> 03:34:06,280
This is not even cheats, this is like a guide for the game.

1025
03:34:06,280 --> 03:34:17,040
No, do you guys remember when websites used to do this stupid shit?

1026
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:20,040
And it would be, oh, cheat codes!

1027
03:34:20,040 --> 03:34:24,040
And they would just tell you how to get achievements in the game, or how to unlock something.

1028
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:29,879
Aren't you so happy that these websites probably get zero fucking traffic now?

1029
03:34:29,879 --> 03:34:40,079
Like, I just went to one of these and I'm probably the first visitor in, like, four years.

1030
03:34:40,079 --> 03:34:56,299
God damn it. I can't fucking believe I have to, uh, 13, I have to destroy, it's time to destroy.

1031
03:34:56,299 --> 03:35:01,540
I have to destroy the town. I have to just kill everybody.

1032
03:35:01,540 --> 03:35:03,540
I have to kill everyone!

1033
03:35:05,780 --> 03:35:09,239
I didn't want to do this!

1034
03:35:09,239 --> 03:35:19,860
Reload the save, the save reload is from an hour ago.

1035
03:35:19,860 --> 03:35:25,079
I can't do that. Just kill everyone and send it to missionary.

1036
03:35:25,079 --> 03:35:38,459
Where's lightning?

1037
03:35:38,459 --> 03:35:41,340
You guys are worshipping in the wrong one.

1038
03:35:41,340 --> 03:35:48,750
It's okay.

1039
03:35:48,750 --> 03:35:50,750
I just want to get the cow back.

1040
03:35:50,750 --> 03:35:56,239
Why would this mission even be here? This, like, level three?

1041
03:35:56,239 --> 03:35:59,000
What?

1042
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:03,000
I'm so upset. I can't fucking believe I have to do this again.

1043
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:10,819
Should I reload it? Should I reload it? How far away was that actually? What time is it?

1044
03:36:10,819 --> 03:36:12,819
Five, like, let's say 540.

1045
03:36:12,819 --> 03:36:16,819
It was like 30 minutes ago. Let's do it. Let's just reload it. I'm going for it.

1046
03:36:16,819 --> 03:36:30,059
Because nothing is worse than having to get 14 fucking hundred, I believe.

1047
03:36:30,059 --> 03:36:32,620
It was like 250.

1048
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:35,690
Watch out for those dogs!

1049
03:36:35,690 --> 03:36:46,250
519.

1050
03:36:46,250 --> 03:37:03,680
Didn't you say this is as good as Half-Life 1?

1051
03:37:03,680 --> 03:37:07,969
See, it's 400.

1052
03:37:07,969 --> 03:37:12,170
Fuck, I just want my fucking cow!

1053
03:37:12,170 --> 03:37:14,799
Oh my god.

1054
03:37:14,799 --> 03:37:22,670
Give me a fucking break.

1055
03:37:22,670 --> 03:37:31,559
I should just play Skirmish.

1056
03:37:31,559 --> 03:37:33,930
I'm in too deep now.

1057
03:37:33,930 --> 03:37:38,639
Just stock up on Miracle Juice.

1058
03:37:38,639 --> 03:37:44,420
Yeah, I'm just going to go for a fucking total destruction, I think.

1059
03:37:44,420 --> 03:37:49,350
Like, I...

1060
03:37:49,350 --> 03:37:56,579
What do I need?

1061
03:37:56,579 --> 03:38:04,750
Alright, we have to break. Everybody get up here.

1062
03:38:04,750 --> 03:38:11,959
Just get rid of this for a fucking second.

1063
03:38:11,959 --> 03:38:15,159
I need juice.

1064
03:38:15,159 --> 03:38:20,739
I'm going to torch the place and then fucking water it down.

1065
03:38:20,739 --> 03:38:25,030
Let's go.

1066
03:38:25,030 --> 03:38:29,850
Fireball. Thank you very much.

1067
03:38:30,850 --> 03:38:49,959
And then I'm going to keep those people there and then I'm going to get the lightning ready.

1068
03:38:49,959 --> 03:38:51,959
I'm going to wait.

1069
03:38:51,959 --> 03:38:56,139
Because I also need people to be worshipping at the other one too.

1070
03:38:56,139 --> 03:39:02,090
To get lightning.

1071
03:39:02,090 --> 03:39:05,090
Abuse pause spam near Lethis's temple.

1072
03:39:05,090 --> 03:39:08,090
Let me try. Hold on a minute.

1073
03:39:29,110 --> 03:39:34,250
Kill.

1074
03:39:34,250 --> 03:39:37,319
Did that not hit anybody?

1075
03:39:37,319 --> 03:39:47,950
That didn't do anything.

1076
03:39:52,680 --> 03:39:53,680
Good.

1077
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:56,819
Alright, water.

1078
03:39:57,819 --> 03:40:07,079
Hurry up and worship me so I can get some damn water.

1079
03:40:10,280 --> 03:40:17,600
Okay.

1080
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:19,350
How much do I need?

1081
03:40:19,350 --> 03:40:20,350
330.

1082
03:40:20,350 --> 03:40:21,350
Do it again.

1083
03:40:29,129 --> 03:40:34,059
Don't put it all out. Uh oh.

1084
03:40:34,059 --> 03:40:39,159
Fuck my influence. I have no influence over it.

1085
03:40:44,430 --> 03:40:56,399
I'm trying to save you.

1086
03:40:56,399 --> 03:41:04,690
It's going to keep spreading.

1087
03:41:04,690 --> 03:41:07,690
It's going to spread everywhere.

1088
03:41:07,690 --> 03:41:11,690
Oh, what have I done? What have I done? What have I done?

1089
03:41:17,129 --> 03:41:23,379
Am I not getting belief points anymore? Have they caught on to my bullshit?

1090
03:41:23,379 --> 03:41:29,649
Alright, just kill everybody.

1091
03:41:29,649 --> 03:41:33,750
Yeah, they caught on.

1092
03:41:33,750 --> 03:41:38,479
Make them suffer.

1093
03:41:41,659 --> 03:41:47,290
Would you even go over there?

1094
03:41:47,290 --> 03:41:50,290
That doesn't even make any mechanical sense.

1095
03:42:12,000 --> 03:42:15,680
Oh, he's coming over here.

1096
03:42:15,680 --> 03:42:18,040
What's he doing over here?

1097
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:26,920
Now heal them.

1098
03:42:51,649 --> 03:42:52,649
Why?

1099
03:42:52,649 --> 03:42:55,649
It's like what do you think I'm trying to do?

1100
03:43:05,149 --> 03:43:15,030
Do it again.

1101
03:43:15,030 --> 03:43:18,889
Heal.

1102
03:43:18,889 --> 03:43:19,889
200 belief needed.

1103
03:43:19,889 --> 03:43:22,889
I hope I, I gotta get a save after this.

1104
03:43:22,889 --> 03:43:24,889
That guy's stealing trees.

1105
03:43:24,889 --> 03:43:25,889
Why?

1106
03:43:28,389 --> 03:43:29,389
40 belief?

1107
03:43:29,389 --> 03:43:30,389
Nice, okay.

1108
03:43:30,389 --> 03:43:32,389
Now, hurt them again.

1109
03:43:32,389 --> 03:43:39,899
Where?

1110
03:43:41,899 --> 03:43:55,389
Okay, there you go.

1111
03:43:55,389 --> 03:43:57,389
Flamin' hot cheese?

1112
03:43:57,389 --> 03:43:58,389
Trees?

1113
03:43:58,389 --> 03:44:05,239
Just throw the wolves next time.

1114
03:44:05,239 --> 03:44:06,239
Can I?

1115
03:44:09,409 --> 03:44:14,790
What just happened?

1116
03:44:14,790 --> 03:44:16,790
So just throw the wolves.

1117
03:44:20,760 --> 03:44:22,510
Is that not healing anybody?

1118
03:44:22,510 --> 03:44:23,510
Alright, I'm done.

1119
03:44:23,510 --> 03:44:24,510
Time to fuck it.

1120
03:44:24,510 --> 03:44:25,510
I'm just going for it.

1121
03:44:25,510 --> 03:44:31,200
Just torture Twitter again.

1122
03:44:33,200 --> 03:44:46,000
Alright, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

1123
03:44:46,000 --> 03:45:05,549
Hurry up.

1124
03:45:05,549 --> 03:45:09,549
It's like 60% of my entire, I was supposed to say audience.

1125
03:45:15,260 --> 03:45:17,260
Apparently that's not doing anything anymore.

1126
03:45:23,479 --> 03:45:36,750
Now, seriously, don't do this bullshit again.

1127
03:45:36,750 --> 03:45:47,649
I want our cow back.

1128
03:45:47,649 --> 03:45:48,649
I want him back.

1129
03:45:48,649 --> 03:45:49,649
I miss him.

1130
03:45:49,649 --> 03:45:55,579
I haven't even seen him all stream.

1131
03:45:55,579 --> 03:46:01,059
Okay, everybody alright?

1132
03:46:01,059 --> 03:46:11,299
I'm coming.

1133
03:46:11,299 --> 03:46:13,799
Save the game?

1134
03:46:13,799 --> 03:46:15,799
It's gonna crash.

1135
03:46:15,799 --> 03:46:25,799
It will.

1136
03:46:25,799 --> 03:46:26,799
Don't do it.

1137
03:46:26,799 --> 03:46:35,209
I know.

1138
03:46:35,209 --> 03:46:40,290
Wait for an autosave.

1139
03:46:40,290 --> 03:46:42,290
I just have to not fuck it up.

1140
03:46:45,290 --> 03:46:46,290
No, no, no.

1141
03:46:46,290 --> 03:46:47,469
Lightning.

1142
03:46:47,469 --> 03:46:49,469
This is worse than the Wiimote gestures.

1143
03:46:49,469 --> 03:46:52,469
This is 2001 gestures.

1144
03:47:02,360 --> 03:47:17,200
Just cut it down.

1145
03:47:17,200 --> 03:47:29,680
Shit's on fucking fire.

1146
03:47:30,680 --> 03:47:31,680
Save!

1147
03:47:31,680 --> 03:47:32,680
Got one.

1148
03:47:32,680 --> 03:47:35,559
Got one.

1149
03:47:35,559 --> 03:47:36,559
Everybody live in here.

1150
03:47:36,559 --> 03:47:42,219
Three people are alive.

1151
03:47:42,219 --> 03:47:45,000
Let's go.

1152
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:57,180
Everybody's good.

1153
03:47:58,180 --> 03:47:59,180
Okay.

1154
03:47:59,180 --> 03:48:01,190
Three villages.

1155
03:48:01,190 --> 03:48:06,190
And now imagine my annoyance when I did it last time.

1156
03:48:06,190 --> 03:48:07,190
And I didn't get a game.

1157
03:48:07,190 --> 03:48:09,190
I didn't get a save.

1158
03:48:09,190 --> 03:48:12,540
The fuck?

1159
03:48:12,540 --> 03:48:20,309
Alright, I got a lot of energy.

1160
03:48:20,309 --> 03:48:24,120
Let's drop this down.

1161
03:48:24,120 --> 03:48:26,579
Let's go 20%.

1162
03:48:26,579 --> 03:48:28,579
20% and 20%.

1163
03:48:28,579 --> 03:48:34,209
People need to get back to work.

1164
03:48:34,209 --> 03:48:42,340
Am I using the 1.4 patch?

1165
03:48:42,340 --> 03:48:43,340
Yes, I am.

1166
03:48:43,340 --> 03:48:44,340
1.43?

1167
03:48:44,340 --> 03:48:51,760
Alright, I got a forest miracle.

1168
03:48:51,760 --> 03:48:54,959
Got a lightning miracle.

1169
03:48:54,959 --> 03:48:57,520
We're going to bring some people over here.

1170
03:48:57,520 --> 03:48:59,520
And change them to live over here.

1171
03:48:59,520 --> 03:49:03,959
Yeah, we're going to move some people.

1172
03:49:03,959 --> 03:49:06,520
Do you live here now?

1173
03:49:06,520 --> 03:49:11,889
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

1174
03:49:13,770 --> 03:49:16,229
Like...

1175
03:49:18,659 --> 03:49:19,659
Fix everything.

1176
03:49:19,659 --> 03:49:22,950
Alright, here he comes.

1177
03:49:22,950 --> 03:49:23,950
Here he comes.

1178
03:49:23,950 --> 03:49:27,770
He's upset that I did this.

1179
03:49:27,770 --> 03:49:28,770
Chilling out.

1180
03:49:28,770 --> 03:49:32,420
Come live over here.

1181
03:49:33,420 --> 03:49:35,420
Just throw the wolves.

1182
03:49:35,420 --> 03:49:36,420
I'm going for that.

1183
03:49:36,420 --> 03:49:45,280
I'm going to whip them.

1184
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:46,280
Alright, who needs wood?

1185
03:49:46,280 --> 03:49:48,600
You do.

1186
03:49:48,600 --> 03:49:49,600
How much?

1187
03:49:49,600 --> 03:49:52,120
Okay, you can build that.

1188
03:49:52,120 --> 03:49:53,120
Fix that up.

1189
03:49:53,120 --> 03:50:00,809
We need food.

1190
03:50:00,809 --> 03:50:05,799
I'm working on it.

1191
03:50:06,799 --> 03:50:09,559
Miracle food.

1192
03:50:09,559 --> 03:50:17,719
So we just call them a crybaby?

1193
03:50:17,719 --> 03:50:20,180
Whoa.

1194
03:50:20,180 --> 03:50:22,180
Easy.

1195
03:50:22,180 --> 03:50:27,489
Miracle food.

1196
03:50:27,489 --> 03:50:30,049
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1197
03:50:30,049 --> 03:50:31,549
Okay.

1198
03:50:31,549 --> 03:50:32,549
One more.

1199
03:50:32,549 --> 03:50:34,809
Fixing up the town.

1200
03:50:34,809 --> 03:50:35,809
Everything's good to go.

1201
03:50:35,809 --> 03:50:51,559
There's a lot of settlements over here.

1202
03:50:51,559 --> 03:50:52,559
Just pause?

1203
03:50:52,559 --> 03:50:54,559
I could just pause, you're right.

1204
03:50:54,559 --> 03:50:56,370
Uh, hello?

1205
03:50:56,370 --> 03:50:58,370
This is taking a long time.

1206
03:50:58,370 --> 03:51:01,000
Miracle food.

1207
03:51:01,000 --> 03:51:08,000
You may have your few believers, but I can still command the beasts of the wilderness.

1208
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:09,000
Did he just kill everything?

1209
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:12,000
I think he just accidentally killed all of his stuff.

1210
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:15,639
They're all on fire?

1211
03:51:15,639 --> 03:51:20,420
It seems you have meet the wolf.

1212
03:51:20,420 --> 03:51:21,420
Here we go.

1213
03:51:21,420 --> 03:51:23,420
But I think I can help you.

1214
03:51:23,420 --> 03:51:25,420
I will try to destroy some of the wolves.

1215
03:51:25,420 --> 03:51:26,420
They're on fire.

1216
03:51:26,420 --> 03:51:27,420
That is all.

1217
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:28,420
Okay, here we go.

1218
03:51:28,420 --> 03:51:32,110
Get the food miracle off of my bar.

1219
03:51:32,110 --> 03:51:52,719
Uh, get the food miracle.

1220
03:51:52,719 --> 03:51:57,670
I can't pick them up.

1221
03:51:57,670 --> 03:52:22,280
Lightning and I, you can't throw, I can't, I can't, I cannot do anything past here.

1222
03:52:22,280 --> 03:52:26,799
I can't do anything past here.

1223
03:52:26,799 --> 03:52:29,799
I can't grab anything, I can't cast any spells.

1224
03:52:29,799 --> 03:52:34,510
I can't do anything past my influence.

1225
03:52:34,510 --> 03:52:50,510
I need the fucking actor over here.

1226
03:52:50,510 --> 03:52:53,680
What a crock of shit.

1227
03:52:53,680 --> 03:53:28,049
Use the actor and put a shield up.

1228
03:53:28,049 --> 03:53:31,940
What the fuck, man.

1229
03:53:31,940 --> 03:53:43,200
When it comes to meltdown?

1230
03:53:43,200 --> 03:53:45,200
No, but like, why?

1231
03:53:45,200 --> 03:53:48,530
You big bully.

1232
03:53:48,530 --> 03:53:50,530
Please don't throw me.

1233
03:53:50,530 --> 03:53:54,559
You didn't kill me.

1234
03:53:54,559 --> 03:53:58,569
Please don't throw me.

1235
03:53:58,569 --> 03:54:00,569
On my arm.

1236
03:54:00,569 --> 03:54:01,569
Here they come.

1237
03:54:01,569 --> 03:54:02,569
All right.

1238
03:54:02,569 --> 03:54:04,569
Stop doing fucking slow motion.

1239
03:54:04,569 --> 03:54:06,569
What's the point of doing it every time?

1240
03:54:06,569 --> 03:54:08,569
Oh, you big bully.

1241
03:54:08,569 --> 03:54:11,569
Try it again and you're dead.

1242
03:54:11,569 --> 03:54:18,889
I need you over here.

1243
03:54:18,889 --> 03:54:21,899
Please don't throw me.

1244
03:54:21,899 --> 03:54:22,899
Oh my God.

1245
03:54:22,899 --> 03:54:24,899
Stop doing slow motion.

1246
03:54:24,899 --> 03:54:28,610
They're going to get in.

1247
03:54:28,610 --> 03:54:29,610
I should have just done.

1248
03:54:29,610 --> 03:54:31,360
Oh, what a great feature.

1249
03:54:31,360 --> 03:54:34,690
Slow mo everything.

1250
03:54:34,690 --> 03:54:36,690
You didn't kill me.

1251
03:54:36,690 --> 03:54:41,840
I don't even know where they are.

1252
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:56,579
Are they dead?

1253
03:54:56,579 --> 03:55:00,639
Do I know lightning?

1254
03:55:00,639 --> 03:55:10,290
I do know lightning, but it's going to take too long to load it up and I can't cast it over here.

1255
03:55:10,290 --> 03:55:11,290
I don't see anything.

1256
03:55:11,290 --> 03:55:12,290
You see anything?

1257
03:55:12,290 --> 03:55:13,530
I think I did it.

1258
03:55:13,530 --> 03:55:15,860
I don't see any.

1259
03:55:15,860 --> 03:55:19,469
Did I do it?

1260
03:55:19,469 --> 03:55:29,280
Leave it.

1261
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:31,280
I'm not worth it.

1262
03:55:31,280 --> 03:55:36,110
I think that's it.

1263
03:55:36,110 --> 03:55:38,309
What do you mean it's there?

1264
03:55:38,309 --> 03:55:39,309
What do you mean it's there?

1265
03:55:39,309 --> 03:55:40,309
Where?

1266
03:55:40,309 --> 03:55:41,309
Where?

1267
03:55:41,309 --> 03:55:46,770
What are you talking about?

1268
03:55:46,770 --> 03:55:47,770
This is one more.

1269
03:55:47,770 --> 03:55:55,600
What do you see one more?

1270
03:55:55,600 --> 03:55:56,600
What are you talking about?

1271
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:58,479
No, there's no more.

1272
03:55:58,479 --> 03:56:01,389
No, there's no more.

1273
03:56:01,389 --> 03:56:07,879
We're good.

1274
03:56:07,879 --> 03:56:12,319
Oh, hell.

1275
03:56:12,319 --> 03:56:13,319
You didn't kill me.

1276
03:56:13,319 --> 03:56:14,319
No, there's no more.

1277
03:56:14,319 --> 03:56:15,319
All right.

1278
03:56:15,319 --> 03:56:16,319
We're safe.

1279
03:56:16,319 --> 03:56:17,319
Back to work.

1280
03:56:17,319 --> 03:56:19,680
Why won't the game save?

1281
03:56:19,680 --> 03:56:21,629
Fuck if I know.

1282
03:56:21,629 --> 03:56:33,719
Throw me around.

1283
03:56:33,719 --> 03:56:40,229
Now, how am I going to get out there?

1284
03:56:40,229 --> 03:56:46,000
This is going to be a huge pain in the ass to go all the way down here.

1285
03:56:46,000 --> 03:56:48,309
Check under the tree.

1286
03:56:48,309 --> 03:56:52,399
There's nothing there.

1287
03:56:52,399 --> 03:56:54,399
No, you don't scare me.

1288
03:56:54,399 --> 03:56:56,399
I'm going to I'm going to grow this town.

1289
03:56:56,399 --> 03:56:57,399
Yeah.

1290
03:56:57,399 --> 03:57:03,379
Okay.

1291
03:57:03,379 --> 03:57:05,770
I just scared the absolute shit out of me.

1292
03:57:05,770 --> 03:57:06,770
I thought there was one in here.

1293
03:57:06,770 --> 03:57:07,770
All right.

1294
03:57:07,770 --> 03:57:08,770
Let's bring some.

1295
03:57:08,770 --> 03:57:09,770
I got to get some people over here.

1296
03:57:09,770 --> 03:57:14,360
We have to build up this town.

1297
03:57:14,360 --> 03:57:15,360
Chilling out.

1298
03:57:15,360 --> 03:57:16,360
You're now over here.

1299
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:17,360
I'm not worth it.

1300
03:57:17,360 --> 03:57:18,360
Fix that, please.

1301
03:57:18,360 --> 03:57:19,360
Chilling out.

1302
03:57:19,360 --> 03:57:22,520
Chilling out.

1303
03:57:22,520 --> 03:57:23,520
Chilling out.

1304
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:27,000
Disciple builder.

1305
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:28,000
Fix this place up.

1306
03:57:28,000 --> 03:57:29,299
Okay.

1307
03:57:29,299 --> 03:57:30,299
Now fix this one, too.

1308
03:57:30,299 --> 03:57:34,870
Disciple builder.

1309
03:57:34,870 --> 03:57:35,870
We need people to live here.

1310
03:57:35,870 --> 03:57:36,870
If you see this.

1311
03:57:36,870 --> 03:57:37,870
What are you doing?

1312
03:57:37,870 --> 03:57:41,989
Oh, please don't pick me up.

1313
03:57:41,989 --> 03:57:42,989
I hope that I can't wait till that guy's dead.

1314
03:57:42,989 --> 03:57:43,989
I really can't wait till that guy's dead.

1315
03:57:43,989 --> 03:57:45,870
Okay.

1316
03:57:45,870 --> 03:57:46,870
How much wood do we need?

1317
03:57:46,870 --> 03:57:47,870
Disciple builder.

1318
03:57:47,870 --> 03:57:48,870
I have plenty of wood.

1319
03:57:48,870 --> 03:57:50,489
Let me dump some on all these places.

1320
03:57:50,489 --> 03:58:12,170
I want the cow back so bad.

1321
03:58:12,170 --> 03:58:22,670
Who lives here?

1322
03:58:22,670 --> 03:58:32,270
Wood required, 23.

1323
03:58:32,270 --> 03:58:34,270
Just fix this place up.

1324
03:58:34,270 --> 03:58:41,840
Right here.

1325
03:58:41,840 --> 03:58:42,840
All right.

1326
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:44,920
Build it back up.

1327
03:58:44,920 --> 03:58:45,920
I need to...

1328
03:58:45,920 --> 03:58:47,920
I need people to come and actually live here.

1329
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:55,790
I thought the prison was 98.

1330
03:58:55,790 --> 03:58:56,790
Holy shit.

1331
03:58:56,790 --> 03:58:59,180
Okay.

1332
03:58:59,180 --> 03:59:02,180
How do I get you to live here, though?

1333
03:59:02,180 --> 03:59:03,180
There we go.

1334
03:59:03,180 --> 03:59:04,180
Live here and love.

1335
03:59:04,180 --> 03:59:05,180
Live here and love.

1336
03:59:05,180 --> 03:59:06,180
Live here and love.

1337
03:59:06,180 --> 03:59:07,180
Live here and love.

1338
03:59:07,180 --> 03:59:08,180
More of you.

1339
03:59:08,180 --> 03:59:09,180
I think I can drop...

1340
03:59:09,180 --> 03:59:10,180
This town has a ton of people in it.

1341
03:59:10,180 --> 03:59:11,180
Let's drop the worshipping a little bit.

1342
03:59:11,180 --> 03:59:12,180
Yeah, we can do like...

1343
03:59:12,180 --> 03:59:18,670
15% is fine.

1344
03:59:18,670 --> 03:59:19,670
Sleeping at home.

1345
03:59:19,670 --> 03:59:21,549
We need more people to live.

1346
03:59:21,549 --> 03:59:22,549
Your worshippers are working assholes.

1347
03:59:22,549 --> 03:59:26,159
Good.

1348
03:59:26,159 --> 03:59:27,159
It's not good.

1349
03:59:27,159 --> 03:59:29,100
That's...

1350
03:59:29,100 --> 03:59:30,100
What am I talking about?

1351
03:59:30,100 --> 03:59:31,100
Okay, then.

1352
03:59:31,100 --> 03:59:32,100
Over here.

1353
03:59:32,100 --> 03:59:35,639
You live here now?

1354
03:59:35,639 --> 03:59:36,639
Can you not live there?

1355
03:59:36,639 --> 03:59:37,639
Oh, it's a kid.

1356
03:59:37,639 --> 03:59:38,639
It's a little kid.

1357
03:59:38,639 --> 03:59:39,639
God damn it.

1358
03:59:39,639 --> 03:59:40,639
Balding?

1359
03:59:40,639 --> 03:59:41,639
Oh, building.

1360
03:59:41,639 --> 03:59:43,200
27.

1361
03:59:43,200 --> 03:59:44,200
Okay.

1362
03:59:44,200 --> 03:59:45,200
Okay.

1363
03:59:45,200 --> 03:59:46,760
Okay.

1364
03:59:46,760 --> 03:59:47,760
Okay.

1365
03:59:47,760 --> 03:59:48,760
Okay.

1366
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:50,319
Okay.

1367
03:59:50,319 --> 03:59:51,319
Okay.

1368
03:59:51,319 --> 03:59:54,930
Okay.

1369
03:59:54,930 --> 04:00:00,200
Okay.

1370
04:00:00,200 --> 04:00:01,200
Okay.

1371
04:00:02,200 --> 04:00:03,200
It's a little kid.

1372
04:00:03,200 --> 04:00:04,200
God damn it.

1373
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:07,040
Balding?

1374
04:00:07,040 --> 04:00:13,850
Oh, building.

1375
04:00:13,850 --> 04:00:14,850
27.

1376
04:00:14,850 --> 04:00:21,700
Live here and love.

1377
04:00:21,700 --> 04:00:22,700
Yes.

1378
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:23,700
All right.

1379
04:00:23,700 --> 04:00:25,639
More.

1380
04:00:25,639 --> 04:00:29,329
We have to really start to settle in this area.

1381
04:00:29,329 --> 04:00:32,329
Because this is going to be the one of the last towns.

1382
04:00:32,329 --> 04:00:33,700
Live here.

1383
04:00:33,700 --> 04:00:35,700
Live here and love.

1384
04:00:35,700 --> 04:00:37,700
In fact, you need to breed.

1385
04:00:37,700 --> 04:00:40,409
Breed if you can.

1386
04:00:40,409 --> 04:00:43,059
What do we got?

1387
04:00:43,059 --> 04:00:44,059
Any...

1388
04:00:44,059 --> 04:00:45,059
Do we have breeders here?

1389
04:00:45,059 --> 04:00:48,350
Breeder?

1390
04:00:48,350 --> 04:00:49,350
Yeah.

1391
04:00:49,350 --> 04:00:50,350
You guys...

1392
04:00:50,350 --> 04:00:51,350
You gotta breed.

1393
04:00:51,350 --> 04:00:52,350
You guys gotta breed.

1394
04:00:52,350 --> 04:00:53,350
Wait, 80?

1395
04:00:53,350 --> 04:00:54,590
Breed.

1396
04:00:54,590 --> 04:00:55,590
Finally.

1397
04:00:55,590 --> 04:00:57,719
Breed.

1398
04:00:57,719 --> 04:00:59,219
There we are.

1399
04:00:59,219 --> 04:01:00,219
Okay.

1400
04:01:00,219 --> 04:01:01,219
A couple more.

1401
04:01:01,219 --> 04:01:02,219
And then we should be good.

1402
04:01:02,219 --> 04:01:03,219
For now, at least.

1403
04:01:03,219 --> 04:01:13,309
I'm going to bring a ton of that food over here.

1404
04:01:13,309 --> 04:01:14,309
They don't need it.

1405
04:01:14,309 --> 04:01:17,280
No, no, no, no.

1406
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:18,280
No.

1407
04:01:18,280 --> 04:01:19,280
You do live here already.

1408
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:20,280
Live here and love.

1409
04:01:20,280 --> 04:01:21,709
Your people are dying through over-worship.

1410
04:01:21,709 --> 04:01:22,709
Stop this at once.

1411
04:01:22,709 --> 04:01:23,709
There's only like 10...

1412
04:01:23,709 --> 04:01:28,709
There's only like 10% of people doing it right now.

1413
04:01:28,709 --> 04:01:29,709
What?

1414
04:01:29,709 --> 04:01:37,989
All right.

1415
04:01:37,989 --> 04:01:54,079
Give me some of this food.

1416
04:01:54,079 --> 04:01:55,079
Okay.

1417
04:01:55,079 --> 04:01:56,079
Now they have food.

1418
04:01:56,079 --> 04:01:57,250
Now they'll be breeding.

1419
04:01:57,250 --> 04:01:58,250
And then I need a...

1420
04:01:58,250 --> 04:01:59,250
Where's a...

1421
04:01:59,250 --> 04:02:01,520
Where's a production yard?

1422
04:02:01,520 --> 04:02:02,520
Do they have one in here?

1423
04:02:02,520 --> 04:02:12,930
I don't think they do.

1424
04:02:12,930 --> 04:02:13,930
Going home.

1425
04:02:13,930 --> 04:02:14,930
All right.

1426
04:02:14,930 --> 04:02:17,200
You live here.

1427
04:02:17,200 --> 04:02:18,200
Somebody has to fix this shit up.

1428
04:02:18,200 --> 04:02:21,040
Whatever.

1429
04:02:21,040 --> 04:02:22,040
All right.

1430
04:02:22,040 --> 04:02:25,790
With this starting to fill up a little.

1431
04:02:25,790 --> 04:02:26,790
Giving birth.

1432
04:02:26,790 --> 04:02:27,790
There we go.

1433
04:02:27,790 --> 04:02:29,790
Do they have one of those children places here?

1434
04:02:29,790 --> 04:02:30,790
I don't think they do.

1435
04:02:30,790 --> 04:02:32,920
All right.

1436
04:02:32,920 --> 04:02:37,940
Wood.

1437
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:40,940
Do we need a child care center or whatever it's called?

1438
04:02:40,940 --> 04:02:55,620
They already have one.

1439
04:02:55,620 --> 04:02:57,629
Well, I need to build something.

1440
04:02:57,629 --> 04:02:58,629
Does it need wood?

1441
04:02:58,629 --> 04:03:03,840
No, that's right.

1442
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:04,840
It's right there.

1443
04:03:04,840 --> 04:03:08,270
I need another one of those construction yards.

1444
04:03:08,270 --> 04:03:09,270
The workshops.

1445
04:03:09,270 --> 04:03:11,209
All right.

1446
04:03:11,209 --> 04:03:15,649
I need a civic...

1447
04:03:15,649 --> 04:03:16,649
What is it?

1448
04:03:16,649 --> 04:03:17,649
What's it called?

1449
04:03:17,649 --> 04:03:20,649
Three to make a civic building.

1450
04:03:20,649 --> 04:03:24,659
Should I make a new village center?

1451
04:03:24,659 --> 04:03:33,340
Or should I make a civic building?

1452
04:03:33,340 --> 04:03:36,500
Launch an attack?

1453
04:03:36,500 --> 04:03:37,500
You can't.

1454
04:03:37,500 --> 04:03:43,389
It doesn't exist.

1455
04:03:43,389 --> 04:03:45,389
We haven't had the cow in three hours.

1456
04:03:45,389 --> 04:03:46,389
I know the time.

1457
04:03:46,389 --> 04:03:47,389
Yeah, I know.

1458
04:03:47,389 --> 04:03:48,389
Well, is that my fault?

1459
04:03:48,389 --> 04:03:57,159
We have this awesome, really cool, fun, awesome mechanic where you have an animal and they

1460
04:03:57,159 --> 04:04:07,610
just take the fucking thing away from you three hours, four hours into the game.

1461
04:04:07,610 --> 04:04:08,610
Can I bring this?

1462
04:04:08,610 --> 04:04:10,170
What should I do?

1463
04:04:10,170 --> 04:04:16,360
This is to make a workshop over here.

1464
04:04:16,360 --> 04:04:18,920
I need to like right there.

1465
04:04:18,920 --> 04:04:19,920
What is it?

1466
04:04:19,920 --> 04:04:23,719
Workshop?

1467
04:04:23,719 --> 04:04:24,719
How far can I go out?

1468
04:04:24,719 --> 04:04:29,450
Do they have a workshop?

1469
04:04:29,450 --> 04:04:31,780
They don't, do they?

1470
04:04:31,780 --> 04:04:33,020
All right.

1471
04:04:33,020 --> 04:04:34,020
This is it.

1472
04:04:34,020 --> 04:04:41,190
This is a cow waiting room.

1473
04:04:41,190 --> 04:04:42,190
Yeah, I know.

1474
04:04:42,190 --> 04:04:53,920
Me too.

1475
04:04:53,920 --> 04:05:12,500
The reason why I did the workshop here is because I'm going to spam trees into it.

1476
04:05:12,500 --> 04:05:13,500
Name the cow.

1477
04:05:13,500 --> 04:05:17,040
I already did.

1478
04:05:17,040 --> 04:05:18,040
What's the name?

1479
04:05:18,040 --> 04:05:29,729
How much more wood?

1480
04:05:29,729 --> 04:05:33,469
Okay.

1481
04:05:33,469 --> 04:05:34,469
Build it.

1482
04:05:34,469 --> 04:05:35,469
You too.

1483
04:05:35,469 --> 04:05:38,469
Did I just grab you?

1484
04:05:38,469 --> 04:05:50,200
Build it.

1485
04:06:02,389 --> 04:06:07,610
No.

1486
04:06:07,610 --> 04:06:11,319
Sacrifice.

1487
04:06:11,319 --> 04:06:14,319
No, I'm not going to sacrifice.

1488
04:06:14,319 --> 04:06:21,399
We need, uh, I need more builders over here.

1489
04:06:21,399 --> 04:06:22,399
I got to get this.

1490
04:06:22,399 --> 04:06:23,399
Get done.

1491
04:06:23,399 --> 04:06:24,399
Get it done.

1492
04:06:24,399 --> 04:06:25,399
Hurry up.

1493
04:06:25,399 --> 04:06:29,500
I don't know where the fuck you're going.

1494
04:06:29,500 --> 04:06:34,680
Put down the tree.

1495
04:06:34,680 --> 04:06:40,510
Is he going to ever build the graveyard?

1496
04:06:40,510 --> 04:06:45,510
The idea here is when this is built, I'm going to spam trees into it and build a ton of shit

1497
04:06:45,510 --> 04:06:51,370
and just command and conquer red alert my way over here and then take this over.

1498
04:06:51,370 --> 04:07:00,010
But they have to build it first.

1499
04:07:00,010 --> 04:07:03,659
Get a graveyard already.

1500
04:07:03,659 --> 04:07:04,659
It's part of the plan.

1501
04:07:04,659 --> 04:07:05,899
How are we doing on food?

1502
04:07:05,899 --> 04:07:06,899
We're okay.

1503
04:07:06,899 --> 04:07:11,440
We're okay on wood.

1504
04:07:11,440 --> 04:07:12,440
Almost done.

1505
04:07:12,440 --> 04:07:14,440
Do I need one more builder over here?

1506
04:07:14,440 --> 04:07:15,440
Yes.

1507
04:07:15,440 --> 04:07:17,770
Disciple builder.

1508
04:07:17,770 --> 04:07:24,280
Oh, I got to ask you a question.

1509
04:07:24,280 --> 04:07:26,639
What's, uh, what game is better?

1510
04:07:26,639 --> 04:07:30,639
Uh, London 2012 or Beijing 2008?

1511
04:07:30,639 --> 04:07:36,610
I want to play one of those Olympic track and field games.

1512
04:07:36,610 --> 04:07:46,000
Which one is better?

1513
04:07:46,000 --> 04:07:47,000
The London one is better?

1514
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:49,649
I've seen a lot of London.

1515
04:07:49,649 --> 04:07:50,649
Okay.

1516
04:07:50,649 --> 04:07:56,180
Mario and Sonic?

1517
04:07:56,180 --> 04:07:58,180
Yeah, I'm already going to play Mario and Sonic.

1518
04:07:58,180 --> 04:08:00,120
All right.

1519
04:08:00,120 --> 04:08:02,120
Let me see how far the influence goes here.

1520
04:08:02,120 --> 04:08:03,120
All right.

1521
04:08:03,120 --> 04:08:04,120
Can we get a fresh start?

1522
04:08:04,120 --> 04:08:09,120
Can we get like, can we, can we start to progress instead of having me regress mentally?

1523
04:08:09,120 --> 04:08:16,360
I want my cow and I'm not stopping the stream until I get him back.

1524
04:08:16,360 --> 04:08:20,450
Not in a million years.

1525
04:08:20,450 --> 04:08:21,450
Send missionaries.

1526
04:08:21,450 --> 04:08:24,780
I can't go that far.

1527
04:08:24,780 --> 04:08:28,780
If I grab a missionary, I have to like, see, I can't do anything.

1528
04:08:28,780 --> 04:08:44,100
Hurry up and build this damn thing.

1529
04:08:44,100 --> 04:08:45,100
Just throw them and hope they live.

1530
04:08:45,100 --> 04:08:52,350
Then if I throw somebody that far, they're not going to live.

1531
04:08:52,350 --> 04:09:03,719
I don't believe it.

1532
04:09:03,719 --> 04:09:06,489
Good.

1533
04:09:06,489 --> 04:09:07,489
Just so you don't know.

1534
04:09:07,489 --> 04:09:13,870
Is it really taking the three this long to build this?

1535
04:09:13,870 --> 04:09:25,350
Like, what is taking you so long?

1536
04:09:25,350 --> 04:09:26,350
What's this?

1537
04:09:26,350 --> 04:09:28,350
It seems you require help.

1538
04:09:28,350 --> 04:09:31,350
That last village is causing you trouble.

1539
04:09:31,350 --> 04:09:35,350
So I have given your people the ability to build a wonder.

1540
04:09:35,350 --> 04:09:36,350
No.

1541
04:09:36,350 --> 04:09:37,350
Too many resources.

1542
04:09:37,350 --> 04:09:38,350
Too many resources.

1543
04:09:38,350 --> 04:09:39,350
Too many resources.

1544
04:09:39,350 --> 04:09:41,350
I don't have the resources.

1545
04:09:41,350 --> 04:09:44,290
That is all.

1546
04:09:44,290 --> 04:09:45,290
I don't have the resources to do this.

1547
04:09:45,290 --> 04:09:48,290
Twenty one thousand fucking resources.

1548
04:09:48,290 --> 04:09:49,290
Thanks for nothing.

1549
04:09:49,290 --> 04:09:55,639
Thanks for, thanks for pawning off your shitty real estate that won't sell.

1550
04:09:55,639 --> 04:09:58,819
Oh, I have this wonderful four bedroom.

1551
04:09:58,819 --> 04:10:03,120
It's just, it's a fixer offer, but you know, you can work with it.

1552
04:10:03,120 --> 04:10:05,069
Out of here.

1553
04:10:05,069 --> 04:10:15,440
It's literally surrounded by wood.

1554
04:10:15,440 --> 04:10:16,440
Yeah, but I still have to build it.

1555
04:10:16,440 --> 04:10:19,440
I think these guys can't even make a workshop.

1556
04:10:19,440 --> 04:10:23,719
And why do I not have any influence?

1557
04:10:23,719 --> 04:10:26,860
I own this building.

1558
04:10:26,860 --> 04:10:34,409
This is outside of my influence.

1559
04:10:34,409 --> 04:10:41,219
What the fuck?

1560
04:10:41,219 --> 04:10:56,260
No.

1561
04:10:56,260 --> 04:10:58,260
No.

1562
04:10:58,260 --> 04:11:02,159
I need a town center.

1563
04:11:02,159 --> 04:11:03,159
Well, let's go.

1564
04:11:03,159 --> 04:11:23,389
I'm doing all this for my boy, my baby boy.

1565
04:11:23,389 --> 04:11:25,389
I'm coming to get him.

1566
04:11:25,389 --> 04:11:34,239
Was it three there?

1567
04:11:34,239 --> 04:11:35,239
Okay.

1568
04:11:35,239 --> 04:11:38,829
Town center.

1569
04:11:38,829 --> 04:11:43,239
It's five, right?

1570
04:11:43,239 --> 04:11:46,239
Five for a new village center.

1571
04:11:46,239 --> 04:11:52,540
Click the link.

1572
04:11:52,540 --> 04:11:54,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet.

1573
04:11:54,540 --> 04:12:00,639
Four.

1574
04:12:00,639 --> 04:12:01,639
One more.

1575
04:12:01,639 --> 04:12:10,040
If I don't see a cow this spring, I'm, I guarantee you see a cow this spring.

1576
04:12:10,040 --> 04:12:11,040
Okay.

1577
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:23,870
There's five here.

1578
04:12:23,870 --> 04:12:29,629
How do I not have to be a field?

1579
04:12:29,629 --> 04:12:39,100
There's five, right?

1580
04:12:39,100 --> 04:12:41,879
Five scaffold.

1581
04:12:41,879 --> 04:13:02,930
I don't fucking care.

1582
04:13:02,930 --> 04:13:05,930
Just build the damn thing.

1583
04:13:05,930 --> 04:13:07,430
He hates the links.

1584
04:13:07,430 --> 04:13:08,430
What's the link?

1585
04:13:08,430 --> 04:13:09,430
Zoinks.

1586
04:13:09,430 --> 04:13:12,649
You've taken a wrong turn.

1587
04:13:12,649 --> 04:13:13,649
The link doesn't work.

1588
04:13:13,649 --> 04:13:15,790
Punished Mega Milk.

1589
04:13:15,790 --> 04:13:17,790
A cow denied by his owner.

1590
04:13:17,790 --> 04:13:20,790
Get that out of here.

1591
04:13:20,790 --> 04:13:22,790
I'm trying to save him.

1592
04:13:22,790 --> 04:13:25,790
I've been trying to save him this whole stream.

1593
04:13:25,790 --> 04:13:38,040
Build.

1594
04:13:38,040 --> 04:13:39,040
I'll put a hundred people over here.

1595
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:40,040
I don't care.

1596
04:13:40,040 --> 04:13:44,479
Get to work.

1597
04:13:44,479 --> 04:14:06,059
How much more?

1598
04:14:06,059 --> 04:14:07,059
One more.

1599
04:14:07,059 --> 04:14:09,389
Okay.

1600
04:14:09,389 --> 04:14:10,389
Now get some more builders over here.

1601
04:14:10,389 --> 04:14:11,389
And I'm almost done.

1602
04:14:11,389 --> 04:14:21,010
Build.

1603
04:14:21,010 --> 04:14:34,090
More.

1604
04:14:34,090 --> 04:14:46,340
Frank, that's a whole lot of sugar and water.

1605
04:14:46,340 --> 04:14:52,190
More.

1606
04:14:52,190 --> 04:14:57,200
Go.

1607
04:14:57,200 --> 04:15:15,569
Going to sleep on the floor.

1608
04:15:15,569 --> 04:15:19,569
Build me a new town center.

1609
04:15:19,569 --> 04:15:21,520
Hurry.

1610
04:15:21,520 --> 04:15:23,879
So I can go over here.

1611
04:15:23,879 --> 04:15:36,489
Might as well just start dumping wood in this thing.

1612
04:15:36,489 --> 04:15:37,729
Punish them?

1613
04:15:37,729 --> 04:15:38,729
They're okay.

1614
04:15:38,729 --> 04:15:47,959
I'll put like another couple of how, no, we need farms and shit out here.

1615
04:15:47,959 --> 04:15:58,309
Honestly, I wish Jerma would just say he doesn't like the cow.

1616
04:15:58,309 --> 04:16:02,309
We haven't seen him all stream because Jerma's trying to save him, but in reality he doesn't

1617
04:16:02,309 --> 04:16:08,799
want him.

1618
04:16:08,799 --> 04:16:10,290
Fuck.

1619
04:16:10,290 --> 04:16:11,290
God damn it.

1620
04:16:11,290 --> 04:16:12,290
Oh.

1621
04:16:12,290 --> 04:16:14,719
How could you say something like that?

1622
04:16:14,719 --> 04:16:17,479
I love him.

1623
04:16:17,479 --> 04:16:20,360
I love Myrius.

1624
04:16:20,360 --> 04:16:34,049
How could you say something so incorrect?

1625
04:16:34,049 --> 04:16:37,049
Just wait till we get him and it's going to be so much better.

1626
04:16:37,049 --> 04:16:47,750
You just had to remember his name.

1627
04:16:47,750 --> 04:16:48,750
Yeah, that's true.

1628
04:16:48,750 --> 04:16:49,750
You're right.

1629
04:16:49,750 --> 04:16:50,750
Yeah, I did.

1630
04:16:50,750 --> 04:16:53,879
I just, I just forgot his name again.

1631
04:16:53,879 --> 04:17:00,879
Like weirdly enough, I'm forgetting his name because, hold on, let me do the heal.

1632
04:17:00,879 --> 04:17:07,149
Because I keep trying not to say the one that you've been planted in my brain.

1633
04:17:07,149 --> 04:17:13,100
He's not going to be the same.

1634
04:17:13,100 --> 04:17:14,100
Yes, he will.

1635
04:17:14,100 --> 04:17:16,299
Looking at something?

1636
04:17:16,299 --> 04:17:26,399
I've finished building this.

1637
04:17:26,399 --> 04:17:28,399
Finished building that.

1638
04:17:28,399 --> 04:17:30,399
You're driving me crazy.

1639
04:17:30,399 --> 04:17:33,559
What?

1640
04:17:33,559 --> 04:17:34,559
Oh, they're going over there.

1641
04:17:34,559 --> 04:17:35,729
Why?

1642
04:17:35,729 --> 04:17:36,729
All right.

1643
04:17:36,729 --> 04:17:38,729
We're just going to get ourselves another field.

1644
04:17:38,729 --> 04:17:41,760
It's going right.

1645
04:17:41,760 --> 04:17:42,760
Where's it going?

1646
04:17:42,760 --> 04:17:43,760
Right in this town?

1647
04:17:43,760 --> 04:17:50,639
No.

1648
04:17:50,639 --> 04:17:51,639
Up here.

1649
04:17:51,639 --> 04:17:52,639
No.

1650
04:17:52,639 --> 04:17:53,639
Where should that go?

1651
04:17:53,639 --> 04:17:54,639
Do they even have any way to produce food in this town?

1652
04:17:54,639 --> 04:17:56,200
No, this is no food production.

1653
04:17:56,200 --> 04:17:57,200
I'll leave it right there.

1654
04:17:57,200 --> 04:17:58,200
All right.

1655
04:17:58,200 --> 04:17:59,500
What are we going to do over here?

1656
04:17:59,500 --> 04:18:07,200
Like literally, like literally, literally right there.

1657
04:18:07,200 --> 04:18:09,969
Still not done.

1658
04:18:09,969 --> 04:18:16,879
Slowest workers ever.

1659
04:18:16,879 --> 04:18:21,040
Just wait for the redemption arc.

1660
04:18:21,040 --> 04:18:25,040
Right now we're on a yogi arc.

1661
04:18:25,040 --> 04:18:27,049
Just wait.

1662
04:18:27,049 --> 04:18:32,229
Wait until we get the redemption arc from Murius.

1663
04:18:32,229 --> 04:18:41,510
Put wood in the wonder.

1664
04:18:41,510 --> 04:18:45,219
It's too far away for me to reliably do it.

1665
04:18:45,219 --> 04:18:48,059
Yeah.

1666
04:18:48,059 --> 04:18:53,159
It's too far away for me to do it reliably.

1667
04:18:53,159 --> 04:19:01,180
All right.

1668
04:19:01,180 --> 04:19:02,180
It's almost done.

1669
04:19:02,180 --> 04:19:03,180
Hurry up.

1670
04:19:03,180 --> 04:19:04,180
Please.

1671
04:19:04,180 --> 04:19:19,370
I need to get over here.

1672
04:19:19,370 --> 04:19:20,370
This is ridiculous.

1673
04:19:20,370 --> 04:19:28,809
84% complete with a dozen people working on it.

1674
04:19:28,809 --> 04:19:30,809
Peter Molyneux, you're not old enough to work.

1675
04:19:30,809 --> 04:19:36,510
Here comes the filler episode.

1676
04:19:36,510 --> 04:19:41,049
Just wait till we get to the actual arc.

1677
04:19:41,049 --> 04:19:44,379
Why is there a seven-year-old up here?

1678
04:19:44,379 --> 04:19:50,329
Is that the cow making that noise?

1679
04:19:50,329 --> 04:19:52,329
What are you doing here?

1680
04:19:52,329 --> 04:20:02,920
Finish it.

1681
04:20:02,920 --> 04:20:07,100
Finished.

1682
04:20:07,100 --> 04:20:08,979
All right.

1683
04:20:08,979 --> 04:20:09,979
Is it?

1684
04:20:09,979 --> 04:20:15,360
This is the only area I get.

1685
04:20:15,360 --> 04:20:22,180
The population's getting low.

1686
04:20:22,180 --> 04:20:23,180
Oh my God.

1687
04:20:23,180 --> 04:20:42,700
I can't fucking believe it.

1688
04:20:42,700 --> 04:20:48,719
This person's dead.

1689
04:20:48,719 --> 04:20:51,719
This person worked to death, apparently.

1690
04:20:51,719 --> 04:21:02,760
Worked until they died.

1691
04:21:02,760 --> 04:21:07,239
Well, I know where I'm going to put the graveyard.

1692
04:21:07,239 --> 04:21:17,290
I'll put it right over here.

1693
04:21:17,290 --> 04:21:19,290
Just build a line of houses here.

1694
04:21:19,290 --> 04:21:22,290
If I build a house right here, will this expand?

1695
04:21:22,290 --> 04:21:35,500
Somebody...

1696
04:21:35,500 --> 04:21:37,500
They'll just build it.

1697
04:21:37,500 --> 04:21:40,250
Don't work on this right now.

1698
04:21:40,250 --> 04:21:41,250
I can't even pick you up.

1699
04:21:41,250 --> 04:21:53,670
Work on this.

1700
04:21:53,670 --> 04:22:09,959
I just wanted you to work over here.

1701
04:22:09,959 --> 04:22:10,959
Like...

1702
04:22:10,959 --> 04:22:13,959
Ay, ay, ay.

1703
04:22:13,959 --> 04:22:16,969
I'm coming.

1704
04:22:16,969 --> 04:22:20,040
Disciple builder.

1705
04:22:20,040 --> 04:22:26,879
Now we need to breed.

1706
04:22:26,879 --> 04:22:29,120
We're okay with food, right?

1707
04:22:29,120 --> 04:22:31,120
All right, breeding time.

1708
04:22:31,120 --> 04:22:35,020
Anybody who in this town can breed?

1709
04:22:35,020 --> 04:22:42,809
You too, I think.

1710
04:22:42,809 --> 04:22:43,809
Offspray.

1711
04:22:43,809 --> 04:22:44,809
No.

1712
04:22:44,809 --> 04:22:47,180
I gotta start moving people from the other town.

1713
04:22:47,180 --> 04:22:55,540
I'm so sick of that fucking happening.

1714
04:22:55,540 --> 04:22:56,540
Disciple forester.

1715
04:22:56,540 --> 04:22:58,540
What do you think I'm trying to do?

1716
04:22:58,540 --> 04:22:59,540
Disciple forester.

1717
04:22:59,540 --> 04:23:00,540
Like...

1718
04:23:00,540 --> 04:23:03,040
What do you think I'm trying to do?

1719
04:23:03,040 --> 04:23:04,040
Stand next to...

1720
04:23:04,040 --> 04:23:10,049
Disciple breeder.

1721
04:23:10,049 --> 04:23:11,049
He's just pointing and laughing.

1722
04:23:11,049 --> 04:23:12,049
Disciple breeder.

1723
04:23:12,049 --> 04:23:25,260
Offspray.

1724
04:23:25,260 --> 04:23:26,260
Oh my god.

1725
04:23:26,260 --> 04:23:28,260
Disciple breeder.

1726
04:23:28,260 --> 04:23:32,569
Okay.

1727
04:23:32,569 --> 04:23:34,569
We have some breeding going on now.

1728
04:23:34,569 --> 04:23:37,569
We're gonna populate this with that town.

1729
04:23:37,569 --> 04:23:42,840
And hopefully they'll finish this.

1730
04:23:42,840 --> 04:23:43,840
Why are they cutting the tree down?

1731
04:23:43,840 --> 04:23:45,840
Because they needed wood.

1732
04:23:45,840 --> 04:23:56,209
When are you gonna get to the half-life factory?

1733
04:23:56,209 --> 04:23:58,209
I don't even know what that means.

1734
04:23:58,209 --> 04:24:02,280
I don't even know what that means.

1735
04:24:02,280 --> 04:24:05,479
Is that supposed to mean something?

1736
04:24:05,479 --> 04:24:08,479
I don't know if that's supposed to mean something.

1737
04:24:08,479 --> 04:24:14,780
All right, build that.

1738
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:21,329
How much wood do I need?

1739
04:24:21,329 --> 04:24:29,629
All right, there are like four or five breeders over there now.

1740
04:24:29,629 --> 04:24:33,209
Now finish this hut.

1741
04:24:33,209 --> 04:24:40,399
No, stop going.

1742
04:24:40,399 --> 04:24:42,399
I'll take care of this.

1743
04:24:42,399 --> 04:24:43,399
Why does...

1744
04:24:43,399 --> 04:24:48,950
You don't even need any more wood.

1745
04:24:48,950 --> 04:24:49,950
Why are they doing this?

1746
04:24:49,950 --> 04:24:56,959
Wood required zero.

1747
04:24:56,959 --> 04:25:08,659
What are you guys doing?

1748
04:25:08,659 --> 04:25:10,659
Like sledding.

1749
04:25:10,659 --> 04:25:22,860
Guys, you don't have to go to the forest for wood.

1750
04:25:22,860 --> 04:25:25,479
What are you doing?

1751
04:25:25,479 --> 04:25:26,479
No!

1752
04:25:26,479 --> 04:25:45,430
Are you going?

1753
04:25:45,430 --> 04:25:49,610
Somebody finished this.

1754
04:25:49,610 --> 04:25:54,389
They're chasing after the tree.

1755
04:25:54,389 --> 04:25:55,389
They don't know what to do.

1756
04:25:55,389 --> 04:25:56,389
They can't...

1757
04:25:56,389 --> 04:25:59,389
Going to the building site with the wood.

1758
04:25:59,389 --> 04:26:05,469
And what, may I ask, are you doing that for?

1759
04:26:05,469 --> 04:26:14,709
I'm okay.

1760
04:26:14,709 --> 04:26:19,170
I guess you don't...

1761
04:26:19,170 --> 04:26:21,170
You made two different piles.

1762
04:26:21,170 --> 04:26:25,309
I heard somebody say omega-low in real life and ironically today.

1763
04:26:25,309 --> 04:26:27,930
I've heard that once.

1764
04:26:27,930 --> 04:26:37,680
I've heard it.

1765
04:26:37,680 --> 04:26:41,559
Let's finish it so I can please have some more influence.

1766
04:26:41,559 --> 04:26:43,559
Before I actually shit my pants.

1767
04:26:43,559 --> 04:26:45,870
Alright, how's the breeding going?

1768
04:26:45,870 --> 04:26:47,680
Okay?

1769
04:26:47,680 --> 04:26:53,920
Breeder?

1770
04:26:53,920 --> 04:26:54,920
Breeder?

1771
04:26:54,920 --> 04:26:55,920
Okay, I have a new child.

1772
04:26:55,920 --> 04:26:56,920
What about...

1773
04:26:56,920 --> 04:26:57,920
Okay, let's check the other town.

1774
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:58,920
We haven't seen it in a while.

1775
04:26:58,920 --> 04:27:00,920
That's 85.

1776
04:27:00,920 --> 04:27:03,440
Dancing.

1777
04:27:03,440 --> 04:27:04,440
Dancing.

1778
04:27:04,440 --> 04:27:05,440
Dancing.

1779
04:27:05,440 --> 04:27:07,190
Okay.

1780
04:27:07,190 --> 04:27:09,190
Let's do some breeding.

1781
04:27:09,190 --> 04:27:12,940
Live here in peace.

1782
04:27:12,940 --> 04:27:13,940
Disciple Breeder.

1783
04:27:13,940 --> 04:27:16,559
I'm going to bring you over here.

1784
04:27:16,559 --> 04:27:20,559
I'm going to bring some more of the young people this way.

1785
04:27:20,559 --> 04:27:26,479
Let's do some breeding over here.

1786
04:27:26,479 --> 04:27:27,479
You live here now.

1787
04:27:27,479 --> 04:27:32,530
Live here in love.

1788
04:27:32,530 --> 04:27:35,530
Live here and love.

1789
04:27:35,530 --> 04:27:38,530
Live here and love specifically.

1790
04:27:38,530 --> 04:27:41,530
These people are all like 10.

1791
04:27:41,530 --> 04:27:45,479
Disciple Builder.

1792
04:27:45,479 --> 04:27:47,479
Offspring.

1793
04:27:47,479 --> 04:27:48,479
Wait, what?

1794
04:27:48,479 --> 04:27:51,670
This wasn't a...

1795
04:27:51,670 --> 04:27:57,750
Alright, I need a female.

1796
04:27:57,750 --> 04:27:58,750
27.

1797
04:27:58,750 --> 04:28:01,840
Is that a female?

1798
04:28:01,840 --> 04:28:02,840
29.

1799
04:28:02,840 --> 04:28:07,639
Alright, let's go.

1800
04:28:07,639 --> 04:28:14,729
I'm working on it.

1801
04:28:14,729 --> 04:28:16,040
Live here.

1802
04:28:16,040 --> 04:28:17,040
Live here in love.

1803
04:28:17,040 --> 04:28:19,040
Live here in love.

1804
04:28:19,040 --> 04:28:23,090
And breed.

1805
04:28:23,090 --> 04:28:24,090
Disciple Breeder.

1806
04:28:24,090 --> 04:28:25,090
There you go.

1807
04:28:25,090 --> 04:28:26,090
Okay, keep it going.

1808
04:28:26,090 --> 04:28:27,909
How are we doing?

1809
04:28:27,909 --> 04:28:29,340
Is this done?

1810
04:28:29,340 --> 04:28:35,200
I mean, it's really not that much more influence.

1811
04:28:35,200 --> 04:28:38,200
It's like barely any at all.

1812
04:28:38,200 --> 04:28:49,659
Save these edits for later.

1813
04:28:49,659 --> 04:28:53,659
For when I get the cow and then probably like turn the stream off.

1814
04:28:53,659 --> 04:28:57,659
Because it's been like 8 hours doing this dumb shit.

1815
04:28:57,659 --> 04:29:12,290
Alright, I gotta start to pull the...

1816
04:29:12,290 --> 04:29:14,290
We gotta start to build this shit.

1817
04:29:14,290 --> 04:29:22,270
Hopefully this actually does what I think it's going to do.

1818
04:29:22,270 --> 04:29:30,250
How many more do I need?

1819
04:29:30,250 --> 04:29:31,250
10,000?

1820
04:29:31,250 --> 04:29:37,010
Does anybody have 10,000 wood over here?

1821
04:29:37,010 --> 04:29:48,250
I'm not even sure there's 10,000 wood in this entire forest.

1822
04:29:48,250 --> 04:29:49,250
I missed the cow.

1823
04:29:49,250 --> 04:29:55,479
Yeah, because without the cow, this game just turns into like a grindy building sim.

1824
04:29:55,479 --> 04:30:01,889
The cow was fun and funny and shit and they took him from us.

1825
04:30:01,889 --> 04:30:21,920
They took him from you.

1826
04:30:21,920 --> 04:30:25,000
Yeah, but it's us.

1827
04:30:25,000 --> 04:30:27,000
We're in this together.

1828
04:30:27,000 --> 04:30:29,879
Can I not grab from this forest?

1829
04:30:29,879 --> 04:30:40,780
Nothing to do.

1830
04:30:40,780 --> 04:30:43,780
Except for build this house.

1831
04:30:43,780 --> 04:30:47,489
Not under attack.

1832
04:30:47,489 --> 04:30:50,780
Build.

1833
04:30:50,780 --> 04:30:58,909
Looking for something to do?

1834
04:30:58,909 --> 04:31:01,909
What the fuck are you talking about?

1835
04:31:01,909 --> 04:31:17,270
Do I have to drop the actor here?

1836
04:31:17,270 --> 04:31:36,469
Someone will eventually build this thing.

1837
04:31:36,469 --> 04:31:37,469
I hope.

1838
04:31:37,469 --> 04:31:41,969
How much more wood?

1839
04:31:41,969 --> 04:31:42,969
A thousand.

1840
04:31:42,969 --> 04:31:54,110
I'm starting to shimmy around in my chair.

1841
04:31:54,110 --> 04:31:55,110
Alright.

1842
04:31:55,110 --> 04:31:59,110
For the love of God, build this so I can finish this stupid level.

1843
04:31:59,110 --> 04:32:06,600
Is this what that person was talking about when they said,

1844
04:32:06,600 --> 04:32:07,600
Oh, you got to level three.

1845
04:32:07,600 --> 04:32:09,600
Laugh out loud.

1846
04:32:09,600 --> 04:32:11,840
Is this why you were laughing?

1847
04:32:11,840 --> 04:32:13,840
Is this why you thought this was so funny?

1848
04:32:13,840 --> 04:32:28,040
He warned you.

1849
04:32:28,040 --> 04:32:35,209
Just build this.

1850
04:32:35,209 --> 04:32:36,209
Just build it.

1851
04:32:36,209 --> 04:32:40,209
Does everybody fucking get over here and build this shit?

1852
04:32:40,209 --> 04:32:42,209
I want my cow.

1853
04:32:42,209 --> 04:32:53,860
Disciple builder.

1854
04:32:53,860 --> 04:32:57,059
Your ignorance has led to your defeat?

1855
04:32:57,059 --> 04:33:01,350
I don't think so.

1856
04:33:01,350 --> 04:33:05,060
Disciple builder.

1857
04:33:05,060 --> 04:33:06,060
What do you mean defeat?

1858
04:33:06,060 --> 04:33:08,060
I'm not defeated yet.

1859
04:33:08,060 --> 04:33:10,959
Peter Molyneux.

1860
04:33:10,959 --> 04:33:14,759
Go build this.

1861
04:33:14,759 --> 04:33:16,759
Disciple builder.

1862
04:33:16,759 --> 04:33:20,279
You don't have to go get food.

1863
04:33:20,279 --> 04:33:21,279
I'll take care of that.

1864
04:33:21,279 --> 04:33:22,279
Just stay there.

1865
04:33:22,279 --> 04:33:29,959
I'm just going to dump it right next to you guys.

1866
04:33:29,959 --> 04:33:30,959
Here.

1867
04:33:30,959 --> 04:33:33,549
No, I can't.

1868
04:33:33,549 --> 04:33:40,139
Your influence, you can't move.

1869
04:33:40,139 --> 04:33:45,990
Finish it.

1870
04:33:45,990 --> 04:33:46,990
Forty one.

1871
04:33:46,990 --> 04:33:47,990
Get over here.

1872
04:33:47,990 --> 04:33:54,840
Build it.

1873
04:33:54,840 --> 04:33:55,840
Build it.

1874
04:33:55,840 --> 04:34:06,639
They're getting wood.

1875
04:34:06,639 --> 04:34:13,110
Stomp them.

1876
04:34:13,110 --> 04:34:16,279
I just have to get up here.

1877
04:34:16,279 --> 04:34:22,279
And then we release our friend who we want so desperately and so badly.

1878
04:34:22,279 --> 04:34:26,279
And then when I get out of here, I'm going to fucking murder.

1879
04:34:26,279 --> 04:34:30,279
I'm going to murder this motherfucker right here.

1880
04:34:30,279 --> 04:34:39,599
I'm going to kill that guy so badly.

1881
04:34:39,599 --> 04:34:44,470
So close.

1882
04:34:44,470 --> 04:34:46,409
Build this wonder.

1883
04:34:46,409 --> 04:34:47,409
How close?

1884
04:34:47,409 --> 04:34:48,409
What's the percentage?

1885
04:34:48,409 --> 04:34:49,409
Is it done?

1886
04:34:49,409 --> 04:34:52,680
Twenty seven percent complete.

1887
04:34:52,680 --> 04:34:54,680
Oh, that's a huge.

1888
04:34:54,680 --> 04:34:55,680
That's a that.

1889
04:34:55,680 --> 04:34:58,709
That's a.

1890
04:34:58,709 --> 04:34:59,709
All right.

1891
04:34:59,709 --> 04:35:03,509
In the meantime, let's work on.

1892
04:35:03,509 --> 04:35:05,509
In the meantime, we have to work on family building here.

1893
04:35:05,509 --> 04:35:15,939
We need offspring.

1894
04:35:15,939 --> 04:35:17,939
That's a two year old.

1895
04:35:17,939 --> 04:35:23,720
I wish I could group grab people instead of having to drag all the way across and grab

1896
04:35:23,720 --> 04:35:29,000
somebody and bring them all the way back.

1897
04:35:29,000 --> 04:35:31,000
Disciple forester.

1898
04:35:31,000 --> 04:35:38,470
And I also wish it wasn't the same button.

1899
04:35:38,470 --> 04:35:39,840
You know what I'm saying?

1900
04:35:39,840 --> 04:35:40,840
Like, I don't want you.

1901
04:35:40,840 --> 04:35:41,840
I want you to be.

1902
04:35:41,840 --> 04:35:42,840
I don't.

1903
04:35:42,840 --> 04:35:44,840
Why does it have to be the same button?

1904
04:35:44,840 --> 04:35:47,840
I want you to breed and nothing else.

1905
04:35:47,840 --> 04:35:51,840
And I have to wait till the indicator goes correct because it's a tree next to me.

1906
04:35:51,840 --> 04:35:58,939
Well, I just had it.

1907
04:35:58,939 --> 04:36:01,180
Disciple forester.

1908
04:36:01,180 --> 04:36:04,119
Oh, man, I'm starting to get annoyed.

1909
04:36:04,119 --> 04:36:11,270
The cracks in the armor is showing in black and white one.

1910
04:36:11,270 --> 04:36:22,389
It was the cow that was keeping it all together.

1911
04:36:22,389 --> 04:36:30,319
Stay strong for the cow.

1912
04:36:30,319 --> 04:36:32,880
Oh, I'm going to.

1913
04:36:32,880 --> 04:36:34,509
Don't you worry.

1914
04:36:34,509 --> 04:36:51,919
We need offspring.

1915
04:36:51,919 --> 04:36:52,919
God damn it.

1916
04:36:52,919 --> 04:36:57,919
Build this already so I can stop this madness and have fun.

1917
04:36:57,919 --> 04:37:05,599
Live here in peace.

1918
04:37:05,599 --> 04:37:08,279
But you possibly have nothing to do.

1919
04:37:08,279 --> 04:37:09,279
Fun?

1920
04:37:09,279 --> 04:37:22,080
We're not supposed to be doing that right now.

1921
04:37:22,080 --> 04:37:30,200
What percentage is this at?

1922
04:37:30,200 --> 04:37:31,200
Fifty one.

1923
04:37:31,200 --> 04:37:32,200
It's almost there.

1924
04:37:32,200 --> 04:37:33,200
And then hopefully we get a big circle here.

1925
04:37:33,200 --> 04:37:37,200
And then I can finally just take this over and be done with this.

1926
04:37:37,200 --> 04:37:42,959
We need offspring.

1927
04:37:42,959 --> 04:37:45,959
There are no women in this whole fucking village.

1928
04:37:45,959 --> 04:37:49,959
When I started the game, it was 80 percent men.

1929
04:37:49,959 --> 04:37:54,090
There are no females.

1930
04:37:54,090 --> 04:38:08,389
Disciple breeder.

1931
04:38:08,389 --> 04:38:10,139
Offspring.

1932
04:38:10,139 --> 04:38:21,299
Disciple breeder.

1933
04:38:21,299 --> 04:38:25,240
Disciple breeder.

1934
04:38:25,240 --> 04:38:31,159
Offspring.

1935
04:38:31,159 --> 04:38:33,159
Live here in peace.

1936
04:38:33,159 --> 04:38:35,159
Whose baby is it going to be?

1937
04:38:35,159 --> 04:38:37,159
Whose baby is it going to be?

1938
04:38:37,159 --> 04:38:38,159
I don't know.

1939
04:38:38,159 --> 04:38:40,159
We're not going to know.

1940
04:38:40,159 --> 04:38:45,599
Do the tree puzzle.

1941
04:38:45,599 --> 04:38:52,000
When's my wonder going to be done?

1942
04:38:52,000 --> 04:38:55,680
Do like a paternity test.

1943
04:38:55,680 --> 04:38:57,680
Wow.

1944
04:38:57,680 --> 04:38:58,860
Ooh.

1945
04:38:58,860 --> 04:39:00,860
Whoa.

1946
04:39:00,860 --> 04:39:01,860
We need offspring.

1947
04:39:01,860 --> 04:39:03,860
We need women.

1948
04:39:03,860 --> 04:39:05,860
We need women is what we need.

1949
04:39:05,860 --> 04:39:09,569
Is this person carrying a rock?

1950
04:39:09,569 --> 04:39:10,569
What are you carrying?

1951
04:39:10,569 --> 04:39:18,060
Wow, we need offspring.

1952
04:39:18,060 --> 04:39:24,060
We need more than three women in the entire group.

1953
04:39:24,060 --> 04:39:40,130
Is that a wolf?

1954
04:39:40,130 --> 04:39:42,130
I can't grab them because it's stupid.

1955
04:39:42,130 --> 04:39:44,130
This is a stupid border thing.

1956
04:39:44,130 --> 04:39:54,029
Which one of them is the woman?

1957
04:39:54,029 --> 04:39:56,029
The wolves don't care.

1958
04:39:56,029 --> 04:39:58,029
At least people are breeding over here.

1959
04:39:58,029 --> 04:40:10,430
What's presented?

1960
04:40:10,430 --> 04:40:11,430
Nothing to do.

1961
04:40:11,430 --> 04:40:17,040
Any women.

1962
04:40:17,040 --> 04:40:18,349
Yeah.

1963
04:40:18,349 --> 04:40:21,349
Disciple breeder.

1964
04:40:21,349 --> 04:40:23,040
Disciple breeder.

1965
04:40:23,040 --> 04:40:26,299
Now you have something to do.

1966
04:40:26,299 --> 04:40:27,299
Excuse me.

1967
04:40:27,299 --> 04:40:28,299
Come on out.

1968
04:40:28,299 --> 04:40:32,569
Any women?

1969
04:40:32,569 --> 04:40:33,569
No.

1970
04:40:33,569 --> 04:40:39,159
Go back to bed.

1971
04:40:39,159 --> 04:40:42,299
Any women?

1972
04:40:42,299 --> 04:40:43,299
All right.

1973
04:40:43,299 --> 04:40:44,299
Who's in here?

1974
04:40:44,299 --> 04:40:52,680
There are breeders over here now, right?

1975
04:40:52,680 --> 04:40:53,990
All right.

1976
04:40:53,990 --> 04:40:54,990
Let's go back this way.

1977
04:40:54,990 --> 04:40:55,990
Here we go.

1978
04:40:55,990 --> 04:40:56,990
Okay.

1979
04:40:56,990 --> 04:40:59,990
Now we're making some babies.

1980
04:40:59,990 --> 04:41:05,389
Offspring.

1981
04:41:05,389 --> 04:41:07,560
I think this is the only woman in the whole town.

1982
04:41:07,560 --> 04:41:08,560
These are all her children.

1983
04:41:08,560 --> 04:41:26,720
Look at all these kids now.

1984
04:41:26,720 --> 04:41:27,720
All right.

1985
04:41:27,720 --> 04:41:28,720
We have lots of kids.

1986
04:41:28,720 --> 04:41:32,169
I think we can stop with this now.

1987
04:41:32,169 --> 04:41:36,599
Go back to, go back to foresting.

1988
04:41:36,599 --> 04:41:37,599
Excuse me.

1989
04:41:37,599 --> 04:41:38,599
Get out.

1990
04:41:38,599 --> 04:41:41,509
Get out.

1991
04:41:41,509 --> 04:41:42,880
Get out of the house.

1992
04:41:42,880 --> 04:41:49,610
Oh, were you guys, oh, were you busy in there?

1993
04:41:49,610 --> 04:41:51,880
Wait.

1994
04:41:51,880 --> 04:41:53,950
I need you.

1995
04:41:53,950 --> 04:41:58,150
Do what you're doing, but do it over here.

1996
04:41:58,150 --> 04:42:05,529
Offspring.

1997
04:42:05,529 --> 04:42:12,639
Live here in love.

1998
04:42:12,639 --> 04:42:17,590
Okay.

1999
04:42:17,590 --> 04:42:18,590
Offspring.

2000
04:42:18,590 --> 04:42:22,590
Here comes the 78-year-old female.

2001
04:42:22,590 --> 04:42:26,939
Disciple breeder.

2002
04:42:26,939 --> 04:42:35,259
She's already giving birth?

2003
04:42:35,259 --> 04:42:37,259
Disciple breeder.

2004
04:42:37,259 --> 04:42:40,139
Oh, there we go.

2005
04:42:40,139 --> 04:42:41,139
All right.

2006
04:42:41,139 --> 04:42:43,150
Did you build it yet?

2007
04:42:43,150 --> 04:42:48,360
Who's dead?

2008
04:42:48,360 --> 04:42:49,360
Is somebody dead?

2009
04:42:49,360 --> 04:42:50,360
Who's dead?

2010
04:42:50,360 --> 04:42:54,159
89%.

2011
04:42:54,159 --> 04:42:57,159
Will you fucking just fix it already?

2012
04:42:57,159 --> 04:43:04,349
I need food.

2013
04:43:04,349 --> 04:43:10,450
How's a baby formed?

2014
04:43:10,450 --> 04:43:14,970
Two people that love each other.

2015
04:43:14,970 --> 04:43:19,389
What's half of spring?

2016
04:43:19,389 --> 04:43:20,950
I don't know.

2017
04:43:20,950 --> 04:43:29,840
Ask your parents.

2018
04:43:29,840 --> 04:43:34,389
But you're my dad.

2019
04:43:34,389 --> 04:43:36,389
I am not your dad.

2020
04:43:36,389 --> 04:43:39,650
93%.

2021
04:43:39,650 --> 04:43:44,979
Peter Molyneux, hurry up and finish it.

2022
04:43:44,979 --> 04:43:48,220
Peter Molyneux, hurry up and make another game

2023
04:43:48,220 --> 04:43:52,400
where you make this big group social experiment

2024
04:43:52,400 --> 04:43:56,400
with somebody that gets to the center of a giant cube

2025
04:43:56,400 --> 04:44:01,400
that potentially cost hundreds of dollars to spam mine the cube.

2026
04:44:01,400 --> 04:44:03,400
When they get to the center of that cube,

2027
04:44:03,400 --> 04:44:07,400
you make them the creative director for your new game,

2028
04:44:07,400 --> 04:44:14,430
but it's not real, and that game barely even comes out.

2029
04:44:14,430 --> 04:44:17,430
If you were the last person to click inside of the cube

2030
04:44:17,430 --> 04:44:19,430
in that Peter Molyneux cube game,

2031
04:44:19,430 --> 04:44:25,400
you got to be the creative director of Goddess, right?

2032
04:44:25,400 --> 04:44:28,639
And didn't the person that won not even get to do that?

2033
04:44:28,639 --> 04:44:30,639
Didn't they bring him into a room and they were like,

2034
04:44:30,639 --> 04:44:32,639
ah, well, you're really not going to do that,

2035
04:44:32,639 --> 04:44:35,639
but do you think that this would be fun?

2036
04:44:35,639 --> 04:44:38,810
And the dude's like, I guess.

2037
04:44:38,810 --> 04:44:40,810
Okay, thanks for coming.

2038
04:44:40,810 --> 04:44:47,750
You did it.

2039
04:44:47,750 --> 04:44:49,750
You made it to the center of the cube.

2040
04:44:49,750 --> 04:44:50,750
Wait, we're done.

2041
04:44:50,750 --> 04:44:51,750
We got it.

2042
04:44:51,750 --> 04:44:53,500
Is it done?

2043
04:44:53,500 --> 04:45:10,970
It's not done, is it?

2044
04:45:10,970 --> 04:45:17,490
I didn't get anything, so I got lied to by the yogi guy.

2045
04:45:17,490 --> 04:45:22,799
This doesn't do anything.

2046
04:45:22,799 --> 04:45:27,799
At this point, I think I'm going to start throwing fucking rocks

2047
04:45:27,799 --> 04:45:28,799
from over here.

2048
04:45:28,799 --> 04:46:06,529
I'm just building single houses in a straight line this way.

2049
04:46:06,529 --> 04:46:26,080
Houses don't give influence.

2050
04:46:26,080 --> 04:46:29,080
Only town center and scaffoldings do.

2051
04:46:29,080 --> 04:46:34,979
Well, how the fuck am I supposed to get over here?

2052
04:46:34,979 --> 04:46:39,080
Build another town center over here?

2053
04:46:39,080 --> 04:46:48,650
Do I have to use the throw guy?

2054
04:46:48,650 --> 04:46:52,209
I have to increase my population massively.

2055
04:46:52,209 --> 04:46:56,240
I mean, they're going at it.

2056
04:46:56,240 --> 04:46:58,240
They're going for it.

2057
04:46:58,240 --> 04:47:07,119
Offspring.

2058
04:47:07,119 --> 04:47:10,369
Offspring.

2059
04:47:10,369 --> 04:47:12,369
Live here in peace.

2060
04:47:12,369 --> 04:47:16,720
Offspring.

2061
04:47:16,720 --> 04:47:19,860
It's all men.

2062
04:47:19,860 --> 04:47:22,740
It's all fucking men.

2063
04:47:22,740 --> 04:47:23,740
Offspring.

2064
04:47:23,740 --> 04:47:25,740
We only have men.

2065
04:47:25,740 --> 04:47:30,639
There's only males.

2066
04:47:30,639 --> 04:47:36,790
Why?

2067
04:47:36,790 --> 04:47:40,689
Let's go find out once and fucking for all.

2068
04:47:40,689 --> 04:47:42,689
I want to see just how stupid this is.

2069
04:47:42,689 --> 04:47:49,880
All right.

2070
04:47:49,880 --> 04:47:52,060
60% male.

2071
04:47:52,060 --> 04:47:54,060
But that could be in the other villages.

2072
04:47:54,060 --> 04:48:00,200
No, I don't want to go in the creature cave.

2073
04:48:00,200 --> 04:48:01,200
I want...

2074
04:48:01,200 --> 04:48:13,810
He's angry clicking now.

2075
04:48:13,810 --> 04:48:14,810
I just want to...

2076
04:48:14,810 --> 04:48:19,630
I just want my fucking creature back because that was fun.

2077
04:48:19,630 --> 04:48:21,630
There are so many people over here.

2078
04:48:21,630 --> 04:48:23,630
So many kids.

2079
04:48:23,630 --> 04:48:24,630
We have to start bringing...

2080
04:48:24,630 --> 04:48:26,630
I mean, I have so many people, though.

2081
04:48:26,630 --> 04:48:28,630
Like, I have a lot of people.

2082
04:48:28,630 --> 04:48:32,630
I make up a majority of all the population in this whole world.

2083
04:48:32,630 --> 04:48:36,659
Look at all these kids.

2084
04:48:36,659 --> 04:48:50,479
Do I really have to get the throw guy and, like,

2085
04:48:50,479 --> 04:48:53,479
bring a missionary or something over there?

2086
04:48:53,479 --> 04:48:59,270
What's the premise of this game in five words?

2087
04:48:59,270 --> 04:49:01,270
Game sucks without the cow.

2088
04:49:01,270 --> 04:49:02,569
There.

2089
04:49:02,569 --> 04:49:14,029
Where's the guy that I can throw?

2090
04:49:14,029 --> 04:49:18,380
This guy's 94 years old.

2091
04:49:18,380 --> 04:49:19,380
Throw me around.

2092
04:49:19,380 --> 04:49:21,380
You think I care?

2093
04:49:21,380 --> 04:49:25,159
Please don't throw me.

2094
04:49:25,159 --> 04:49:27,159
94 years old.

2095
04:49:27,159 --> 04:49:32,889
I hope you don't die because I need you.

2096
04:49:32,889 --> 04:49:35,860
All right.

2097
04:49:35,860 --> 04:49:36,860
How much influence do I need here?

2098
04:49:36,860 --> 04:49:45,779
What is it at?

2099
04:49:45,779 --> 04:49:49,220
How much do I need?

2100
04:49:49,220 --> 04:49:50,220
500?

2101
04:49:50,220 --> 04:49:51,220
Not too bad.

2102
04:49:51,220 --> 04:49:53,840
Just destroy the whole fucking town.

2103
04:49:53,840 --> 04:49:58,319
And then I finally get my cow.

2104
04:49:58,319 --> 04:49:59,319
Where is he?

2105
04:49:59,319 --> 04:50:01,139
Please don't throw me.

2106
04:50:01,139 --> 04:50:02,139
You didn't kill me.

2107
04:50:02,139 --> 04:50:03,139
I'm gonna try not to throw you.

2108
04:50:03,139 --> 04:50:04,139
Please don't throw me.

2109
04:50:04,139 --> 04:50:05,139
You didn't kill me.

2110
04:50:05,139 --> 04:50:06,139
All right.

2111
04:50:06,139 --> 04:50:08,139
This is actually where I have to raise the banner here.

2112
04:50:08,139 --> 04:50:09,139
Please don't kill me.

2113
04:50:09,139 --> 04:50:10,139
I need lightning.

2114
04:50:10,139 --> 04:50:12,139
I'm just destroying the whole thing.

2115
04:50:12,139 --> 04:50:19,360
Where's the lightning?

2116
04:50:19,360 --> 04:50:20,790
Here it is.

2117
04:50:20,790 --> 04:50:21,790
All right.

2118
04:50:21,790 --> 04:50:22,790
Let's get lightning.

2119
04:50:22,790 --> 04:50:23,790
Let's do, like, 60%.

2120
04:50:23,790 --> 04:50:30,000
I'm gonna put food over there.

2121
04:50:30,000 --> 04:50:35,759
Must build homes.

2122
04:50:35,759 --> 04:50:39,150
Hopefully we can release that cow.

2123
04:50:39,150 --> 04:50:41,150
The village stored is nearly out of food.

2124
04:50:41,150 --> 04:50:42,150
I know.

2125
04:50:42,150 --> 04:50:45,150
But it don't matter because half of them are going over there anyways to worship.

2126
04:50:45,150 --> 04:50:49,270
They're going to this one, right?

2127
04:50:49,270 --> 04:50:50,270
Yes.

2128
04:50:50,270 --> 04:50:51,270
Is it this one?

2129
04:50:51,270 --> 04:50:55,349
I think it's that one.

2130
04:50:55,349 --> 04:50:56,349
Wait, which one is it?

2131
04:50:56,349 --> 04:51:02,560
Is it the one on the right or the one on the left?

2132
04:51:02,560 --> 04:51:07,360
Yeah, it's the one on the left.

2133
04:51:07,360 --> 04:51:08,360
Give me the lightning.

2134
04:51:08,360 --> 04:51:09,360
Eventually.

2135
04:51:09,360 --> 04:51:12,389
All right.

2136
04:51:12,389 --> 04:51:14,400
There's food over there.

2137
04:51:14,400 --> 04:51:15,400
Hey, where's that actor?

2138
04:51:15,400 --> 04:51:17,400
Let's torch the place.

2139

2396
05:55:59,240 --> 05:56:04,279
long ago he showed us his power and his might it was a terrifying display

2397
05:56:05,799 --> 05:56:11,880
yeah actually before i let me check out the skirmishes you see this land used to be beautiful

2398
05:56:12,439 --> 05:56:17,799
we lived in peace here and we didn't want for anything then the gods themselves appeared with

2399
05:56:17,799 --> 05:56:24,119
the concepts of good and evil at first always will but then the one called nemesis arrived

2400
05:56:24,119 --> 05:56:36,700
and punished us for following you that dance-off was seriously ridiculous that was some loony-tuned

2401
05:56:36,700 --> 05:56:44,979
shit we were forced to worship him he brought forth fire from the heavens he gave us pillars

2402
05:56:44,979 --> 05:56:54,150
of lightning our lives have become a living hell even the sky turned the color of blood

2403
05:56:54,950 --> 05:57:05,000
but nemesis got bored with us and left us alone he wanted to continue his quest to be the only god

2404
05:57:05,560 --> 05:57:14,330
so he set three guardian stones to the first lies under a spiritual shield even the wisest of our

2405
05:57:14,330 --> 05:57:21,619
people don't know how to reach it it's like the end of the game the second guardian stone was

2406
05:57:21,619 --> 05:57:32,540
entrusted to a vicious ogre he's too strong for any mere mortal to beat that was the second to

2407
05:57:32,540 --> 05:57:41,580
last level oh shit this level is really really hard lonely old man who worships only nemesis

i mean this one's this one's closer than this one was okay bacon yeah this this is closer this is

2475
06:13:58,700 --> 06:14:08,119
closer imagine eating a healthy pizza imagine imagine putting walnuts on your pizza i'm sorry

2476
06:14:08,119 --> 06:14:14,009
that's just that's odd to me imagine corn all right bacon here we go uh i'm gonna move this

2477
06:14:14,009 --> 06:14:20,840
stuff around is a steak i wouldn't put steak on pizza peppers i don't like peppers on pizza this

2478
06:14:20,840 --> 06:14:27,860
is this is chicken it can be okay depends i don't know eggplant nope broccoli on pizza is actually

2479
06:14:27,860 --> 06:14:39,159
okay um pineapple i don't put it on pizza was this fresh parmesan i don't know i don't know

2480
06:14:39,159 --> 06:14:46,069
what some of this stuff is mushrooms mushrooms are good where's pepperoni pepperoni the right stuff

2481
06:14:47,830 --> 06:14:54,310
onions are good parmesan is good on pizza i don't even know did this is parmesan i can let me

2482
06:14:54,310 --> 06:15:01,110
let me get the list ready spinach on pizza no thank you jalapenos i can't eat it i can't

2483
06:15:02,250 --> 06:15:13,220
why is corn on this list again i'm so just sausages sausages all right let me get this

2484
06:15:13,220 --> 06:15:35,619
correct um what is this tomatoes what is that crab meat no thanks that's bogus um olives and it was

2485
06:15:35,619 --> 06:15:50,819
this garlic or what tofu is it garlic or tofu the croutons what is this you don't put garlic

2486
06:15:50,819 --> 06:16:04,419
bread on pizza you guys put croutons on pizza it's probably garlic all right hold on let me

2487
06:16:04,419 --> 06:16:10,419
get this right pepperoni onion bacon goes up here chickens and chickens up it belongs above

2488
06:16:10,419 --> 06:16:16,900
bacon in my opinion broccoli goes up there uh mushrooms are okay i'd rather have garlic

2489
06:16:18,709 --> 06:16:23,830
then bell peppers is basic and it just tastes like water i don't like them

2490
06:16:23,909 --> 06:16:27,669
parmesan can go up here the tomatoes just if the pizza sauce is made of the tomatoes

2491
06:16:36,200 --> 06:16:43,220
i don't know this is supposed to be steak well i can tell you i'd rather have pineapple on pizza

2492
06:16:43,220 --> 06:16:55,700
than steak on pizza these are down here are either i can't eat them or they just seem odd to me

2493
06:16:55,700 --> 06:17:10,950
they're anchovies odd days no they're not that looks like a cut off steak no i think that i

2494
06:17:10,950 --> 06:17:16,939
think this is pretty close see everyone that's saying that parmesan what's wrong with you

2495
06:17:16,939 --> 06:17:22,680
parmesan's incredible parmesan is a great masking of bad pizza if you dump parmesan

2496
06:17:22,680 --> 06:17:29,619
cheese all over your slice of pizza it's because the pizza is not very good and you're making it

2497
06:17:29,619 --> 06:17:46,779
taste better that you don't have to put a bunch of parmesan cheese on a really good high quality

2498
06:17:46,779 --> 06:18:01,720
slice pizza it's like sriracha laughing my ass off that's incorrect it's a child flavor palette

2499
06:18:07,540 --> 06:18:20,979
because i don't want to put corn on my pizza i can't believe you put eggplant down in f tier

2500
06:18:20,979 --> 06:18:36,869
when was the last time you guys ordered eggplant on your pizza probably never oh yeah what do you

2501
06:18:36,869 --> 06:18:42,310
want for pizza okay if i'm the child then you're you're the person that nobody wants to order a

2502
06:18:42,310 --> 06:18:47,830
pizza with okay oh let's get let's get a pizza yeah what should we put on it how about eggplant

2503
06:18:47,830 --> 06:18:53,110
and spinach it's like get the fuck out of here i don't what i don't want to order a pizza with

2504
06:18:53,110 --> 06:19:00,330
you yeah maybe we should put corn and crab meat on it uh you can get your own pizza actually

2505
06:19:00,330 --> 06:19:10,869
well if we think about this i don't want that why jalapenos down here jalapenos would be up here

2506
06:19:11,610 --> 06:19:21,990
but i can't eat them anymore i physically can't do it anymore you know what i was thinking but

2507
06:19:21,990 --> 06:19:28,869
yeah uh instead of like pepperoni onion or like bacon chicken bacon or sausage or broccoli bacon

2508
06:19:28,869 --> 06:19:35,319
broccoli chicken i want corn and anchovies you i'm gonna just tell you honestly guys you will be

2509
06:19:35,319 --> 06:19:43,849
somebody that has to order your own pizza no one's gonna want to share this pizza with you

2510
06:19:43,849 --> 06:20:00,009
with corn and spinach on it and i don't i don't want olives i like olives i like olive oil but

2511
06:20:00,009 --> 06:20:05,049
i don't like olives like just eating olives they don't they don't belong down here though

2512
06:20:06,459 --> 06:20:18,790
i would probably i'd rather have olives on my pizza then yeah no no i actually wouldn't i

2513
06:20:18,790 --> 06:20:24,090
actually wouldn't mind it if it was on it i would eat it i don't love it i don't really like it but

2514
06:20:24,090 --> 06:20:38,779
i would eat that slice this is stuff that i wouldn't eat if it was on pizza pineapple is higher

2515
06:20:38,779 --> 06:20:48,169
than spinach i mean yeah you've never had spinach on pizza then oh i have i have it's great when you

2516
06:20:48,169 --> 06:20:53,529
bite into a slice of spinach on it and the spinach comes off and peels off like the lid of a yogurt

2517
06:20:54,330 --> 06:21:06,889
and it's like it's stuck on your mouth and somebody i know at least a few you know what

2518
06:21:06,889 --> 06:21:12,970
i'm talking about it's it's like that solid it just pulls off and like slaps you in the mouth

2519
06:21:12,970 --> 06:21:30,900
and it's like the shape of a yogurt lid pineapple on pizza sucks i just i don't i would say number

2520
06:21:30,900 --> 06:21:41,509
one i'd want i would want pepperoni or um peppers probably should be a little higher than this

2521
06:21:43,639 --> 06:21:48,520
because like peppers mushrooms like i don't i don't you know i don't think so i don't think so

2522
06:21:49,080 --> 06:21:58,659
i don't order sausage on my pizza ever i don't i love onion on pizza it's incredible though i love

2523
06:21:58,659 --> 06:22:09,590
onion yeah i think that's more accurate if this is garlic then it's more accurate now it is no

2524
06:22:09,590 --> 06:22:22,069
it's not okay that's safe no explain your olive hate um i don't i just regular olives just just

2525
06:22:22,069 --> 06:22:44,220
tastes like acid to me they they taste sour and acidic olives are just bitter and gross i mean

2526
06:22:44,220 --> 06:22:48,459
i'm not going to say they're gross i like olive oil is amazing i love olive i put olive oil on

2527
06:22:48,459 --> 06:23:12,599
everything you're so based and epic for this you're so based okay you brown noser hey leave him

2528
06:23:12,599 --> 06:23:42,180
alone leave him alone just because they didn't want corn on his pizza leave him alone all right

2529
06:23:42,180 --> 06:23:49,270
you passed the test you passed the test okay you passed the test i thought if i put uh bacon down

2530
06:23:49,270 --> 06:24:03,060
here people are gonna freak out and i was gonna call you hypocrites okay more and more that i

2531
06:24:03,060 --> 06:24:17,479
think about this i wouldn't i don't order sausage on pizza i don't order mushrooms either on pizza

2532
06:24:17,479 --> 06:24:26,020
i do sometimes but not as much as i would get like that's accurate all right i'm done why broccoli

2533
06:24:26,020 --> 06:24:40,709
you've never had broccoli on pizza before it's amazing now it's done dog food why would i do a

2534
06:24:40,709 --> 06:25:05,459
dog food tier list i've never eaten it dog food derma tier list tier list wait hold on i'm not

2535
06:25:05,459 --> 06:25:17,990

2536
06:25:17,990 --> 06:25:25,830
this one really fast okay you ready let's do best hot pockets this one's gonna go real quick

2537
06:25:27,740 --> 06:26:06,250
okay best hot pocket uh where is the meatball marinara where is it i know it's here somewhere

2538
06:26:06,250 --> 06:26:19,029
meatball marinara where is it that's it right there right and where's the steak and cheese one

2539
06:26:19,029 --> 06:26:22,389
it's like this it's the steak with the cheese and the peppers and the onions where's that one

2540
06:26:26,340 --> 06:26:46,069
right here okay all right why do we got to do hot pockets like this uh and it was a ham and cheese

2541
06:26:46,069 --> 06:26:50,150
was it was the ad no the ham and cheese ones right here right yep okay that's correct that's

2542
06:26:50,150 --> 06:27:04,630
actually accurate what about the four cheese no the rest of these diversities you should never eat

2543
06:27:04,630 --> 06:27:22,090
them he's eaten all of them no i've eaten most is that chicken pot pie oh gross i have eaten

2544
06:27:22,090 --> 06:27:26,700
the ham and cheese when i've eaten the i've had i've had some of these and i've just don't want

2545
06:27:26,700 --> 06:27:31,909
no these are the only ones that are really that really that good what about the breakfast one

2546
06:27:32,709 --> 06:27:39,880
no no just don't eat jimmy deen's instead jimmy deen makes much better breakfast sandwiches

2547
06:27:40,599 --> 06:27:53,799
i would rather have a jimmy deen frozen sausage egg and cheese than a hot pocket egg and cheese

2548
06:27:53,799 --> 06:28:00,630
burrito thing people eat these i thought there was a meme no i used to eat these all the time

2549
06:28:00,630 --> 06:28:06,520
especially these three all frozen fruit is gross ah i don't know i don't agree with you there

2550
06:28:07,689 --> 06:28:16,860
it can be okay best oreo flavors i can do this one because hopefully okay if it's on the list

2551
06:28:17,419 --> 06:28:20,860
i will put it five times higher than everything else is it on the list

2552
06:28:21,819 --> 06:28:25,740
now this is an incredibly this is a terrible list for oreos is there a better one with all

2553
06:28:25,740 --> 06:28:36,500
the oreo flavors there's got to be a better one than that is this one on it nope not on it

2554
06:28:43,959 --> 06:28:52,020
oreo here's another one what about these ones no no the moon the moon marshmallow ones are not

2555
06:28:52,020 --> 06:28:59,560
on here it's the best one you can possibly eat the marshmallow moon it was limited time

2556
06:28:59,560 --> 06:29:17,180
they were the best all right i'm gonna get out of here fat asses hey oh is it on here

2557
06:29:19,610 --> 06:29:31,180
no no it's not on here cool mint oreos okay they yeah cool mint oh those are good but there's no

moon oreos i don't even need to open this uh cool mint oreos um birthday cake oreos i don't like

2559
06:29:43,689 --> 06:29:46,889
double stuff double stuff would be an f-tier because it's just too much it's just too much

2700
06:53:01,529 --> 06:53:04,090
400 bits germa wanted to say that seeing all the production effort you put into

2701
06:53:04,090 --> 06:53:08,009
your stuff has really inspired me to apply myself over the years I'm currently

2702
06:53:08,009 --> 06:53:12,009
interning on a feature film while producing my own short I don't think I

2703
06:53:12,009 --> 06:53:13,689
would do it I think I would be here without you

2704
06:53:13,689 --> 06:53:21,819
seriously man you do so much more than you ever know thank you I'm that's

2705
06:53:21,819 --> 06:53:25,860
awesome that you're on a set on a feature film set right now and you doing

2706
06:53:25,860 --> 06:53:34,790
your own shit the best thing you can do is just keep punching at it see if it

2707
06:53:34,790 --> 06:53:49,759
takes you anywhere you can't win unless you try there is what you ought to say

2708
06:53:49,759 --> 06:53:58,900
do or dude don't do or do not do or do not do there is no try something like

2709
06:53:58,900 --> 06:54:04,939
that right was though you know because a Yoda could do or do not there's my

2710
06:54:04,939 --> 06:54:13,069
yearbook quote by the way I swear to fucking God do or do not do do or do

2711
06:54:13,069 --> 06:54:19,740
not there is no try that was my yearbook quote from Yoda but that's not

2712
06:54:19,740 --> 06:54:26,470
even accurate what I'm trying to say what I'm trying to say is try what if

2713
06:54:26,470 --> 06:54:33,490
that's a terrible quote no it's not that's Bruce Lee do or do not there is

2714
06:54:33,490 --> 06:55:04,720
no try that's Yoda what do you mean Bruce Lee listen to Yoda listen to Yoda

2715
06:55:04,720 --> 06:55:20,299
Bruce Lee Vod instantly got deleted no no I'm not gonna even try it was me

2716
06:55:20,299 --> 06:55:45,729
doing that voice I could probably do it I'm gonna mute I just tried it like six

2717
06:55:45,729 --> 06:55:55,950
times it's not gonna work listen to Yoda though seriously Yoda's got some good

2718
06:55:55,950 --> 06:56:09,250
advice try do it don't or do it don't try try it do Yoda's voice I have a note

2719
06:56:09,250 --> 06:56:14,810
that if you think that I inspire you to do anything I'm happy that that's the

2720
06:56:14,810 --> 06:56:27,139
case I hope it's a force for good hey very nice thanks for the 500 bits

2721
06:56:27,139 --> 06:56:30,700
Jeremy sorry for missing the New Year's stream don't apologize for ever missing

2722
06:56:30,700 --> 06:56:37,619
anything that this stream ever does you under no obligation to ever be here so

2723
06:56:37,659 --> 06:56:40,869
don't worry I'm feeling a bit bummed out at the moment because I didn't manage to

2724
06:56:40,869 --> 06:56:44,790
get into an overseas study program that I was looking forward to now a bit

2725
06:56:44,790 --> 06:56:55,669
directionless I'm sure one where I want to go next any words of wisdom try again

2726
06:56:55,669 --> 06:57:14,540
try again but there is no try who said who told you that all right I'll give it

2727
06:57:14,540 --> 06:57:25,840
a try no try not do or do not there is no try all right yeah I have to go

2728
06:57:25,880 --> 06:57:32,490
against Yoda on this one for a second any words of wisdom for real though

2729
06:57:32,490 --> 06:57:40,259
without any like jokes or anything I would probably say to honestly to try

2730
06:57:40,259 --> 06:57:49,430
it again I don't know how old you are but if you have something that you want

2731
06:57:49,430 --> 06:57:53,700
to do overseas study programs correct me if I'm wrong they're actually kind of

2732
06:57:53,700 --> 06:57:57,659
difficult to get into because they only take a certain amount of students right

2733
06:57:57,659 --> 06:58:04,439
so it's actually not something I don't think I would be too too upset about it

2734
06:58:04,439 --> 06:58:09,639
because it's such an exclusive hard to do they only take like what 30 40 50

2735
06:58:09,639 --> 06:58:13,560
students a lot of times it's incredibly difficult and it's incredibly expensive

2736
06:58:13,560 --> 06:58:21,930
now also remember that if you do an overseas program you may have just

2737
06:58:21,930 --> 06:58:26,049
increased the amount of money it takes for you to go to school by you know

2738
06:58:26,049 --> 06:58:37,529
times three so they do a lot of good where am I going with this one what do

2739
06:58:37,529 --> 06:58:44,150
I mean I'm just saying that it's it's it's expensive and it's hard to do hard

2740
06:58:44,150 --> 06:58:50,970
to get into overseas tuition is cheaper if you live in America wait what the

2741
06:58:50,970 --> 06:58:55,889
overseas study program not going to college in another country you go to

2742
06:58:55,889 --> 06:59:01,979
college in one country and you do a study program in another country you

2743
06:59:01,979 --> 06:59:09,029
don't like go to college in the other country it's a study program for a

2744
06:59:09,029 --> 06:59:13,229
school that's in the country of origin I'm confused what did you mean by this

2745
06:59:13,229 --> 06:59:36,330
yo Yoda yeah Yoda what should I do all right thanks Yoda move to a country with

2746
06:59:36,330 --> 07:00:00,020
better college prices he would recommend get him what would recommend drugs no I

2747
07:00:00,020 --> 07:00:12,080
really wish I had something better to tell you but you can try it again as a

2748
07:00:12,080 --> 07:00:21,369
meme no no carefully okay no stop saying ketamine what is ketamine what is it

2749
07:00:21,369 --> 07:00:29,599
what is ketamine it's an anesthesia or something don't take fucking anesthesia

2750
07:00:29,599 --> 07:00:32,680

2751
07:00:32,680 --> 07:00:36,959
body and like touch you like liver and rip out your organs and stuff don't do
