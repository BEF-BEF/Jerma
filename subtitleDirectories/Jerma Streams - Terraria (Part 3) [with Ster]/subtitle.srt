1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:14,570
Hey, what's happening? We are all set up. Sometimes Terraria just takes a while to get it right,

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:26,579
but we're good. Welcome everybody. Currently in the game, but not... Let's see if we can see if

3
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:40,390
he's ready. Is he ready? Nobody heard you do that. Quick, do that funny thing you just did again,

4
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,350
because nobody heard you do it. Um, has anyone ever heard me do this before? Ever? Hello? Hello?

5
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,070
What did you call me? I was kind of glad that I didn't, I didn't have it muted, you know what

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,869
I mean? I had you muted, so I was kind of happy about that. Honestly, um, I think what you should

7
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:08,500
do is like just mute me now. Mute you now, okay? You're muted? What? I don't understand, what's this

8
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,780
joke? It's like... I thought he was gonna do... I thought he was gonna do... I thought you're gonna

9
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,299
do like a funny thing when I muted you. I thought you were gonna like somehow... I thought you were

10
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:22,219
gonna come through the game audio. The joke is that you'll finally get a week off where you don't

11
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,489
have to talk to me. I thought the joke was Terraria has in-game VoIP, and I'm gonna talk to you in

12
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:36,700
there now. That would be pretty funny, but it doesn't. All right, so if you didn't... if you

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,379
weren't here last time we played this, you probably noticed... Or the time before that.

14
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:48,980
Or the time before that. Or any of those times. Um, everybody in here is dead. He did this thing,

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,379
he did this fucked up thing at the end of the stream where he accidentally summoned like a clam

16
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,340
I mean it was a hilarious final episode to last week's season. So if I'm you, I watch that and I

17
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,180
catch you up. We're on episode 74 right now, I think? Mm-hmm. Of the Terraria let's play.

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,979
The thing is people start appearing like this guy appeared on the roof. Sometimes they might appear

19
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:17,020
in the lava and just die again though. Oh really? That's a possibility. Yeah, that happens. Do we

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,500
should we fill that space or something? No, see, because all the bunny rabbits are walking into it.

21
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:26,860
So they really are. It's a bunny rabbit death machine and that's important to have. But there's

22
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,979
nothing we can do about this. No. We can't just put a platform here and they won't walk into it?

23
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:40,819
Don't don't do it. Because when it's night time and there's enemies out here and they're walking

24
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:47,909
the lava you're gonna be happy then. No, don't do it squirrel. Cute squirrels. Don't do it. Don't.

25
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:58,250
Don't do it, please. He's gonna do it. I'm trying to scare him away. See? He's like,

26
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:08,550
I'm smart. I'm a squirrel. You saved a life. Okay, so what was the last thing we did?

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,460
The last? We've killed one mechanical boss which are the first bosses after normal mode.

28
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,900
Okay, yeah I remember the mechanical skeleton guy. We have to get some of the new ore that's in the

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:35,430
world. There's a lot of things to do. Okay. You can gather ore if you want. Like what do you

30
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,860
want to do? What's your fantasy right now? I like to fight the bosses. That's the most fun.

31
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:48,150
Okay. I have to look up how we craft the new mechanical boss. Light of the ebon hammer.

32
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,719
Is this bad? It looks pretty bad. There was a copper axe that I finally I just saw in the

33
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,080
storage. There's a lot of dumpsters laying around. Is there anybody we can even sell to?

34
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:14,060
The girl on the right. Why are they, how come they're not in their houses? Because when they

35
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,259
appear they show up. They like walk here. You know it's all cinematic, but because our houses

36
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,740
are prisons they can't walk into their room. So if we, actually I don't know how multiplayer

37
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,740
does it, but usually if you like leave the area and come back later they'll just be in their house.

38
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:38,389
Huh, okay. All right, well you want to go collect some ore? Collect some ore? Yeah. Sure,

39
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:48,740
because we absolutely need a Mithrai Anvil. Or a Mithrai Anvil? Mithril. Okay, let's go down our

40
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,189
tube. Down the tube. I need to get you a pickaxe that works. I still have that shitty one from

41
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:07,560
earlier. Yeah, you can't mine these ores. So, should I even come down with you? Yeah,

42
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,040
it'll be, you know. If I can't mine anything I might as well just tell like a funny story

43
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,560
to my chat. Oh yeah, tell a funny story to your chat while I play Terraria for you.

44
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,920
All right, wait, wait, wait. Party up. Red team. Red team. Red team, party up.

45
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:39,959
Oh, what's this thing? How do you do that? You right click on it. Oh, cool. How do I get out?

46
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:50,120
Is it R? E? R, okay. You're dying. Be careful of dying. I'll be all right. Things hurt. I like

47
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,129
don't remember what my items do or like I don't have much of memory. Well, it has, it is a weak

48
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:06,870
angel statue. I'm gonna get that. I want the rope just in case I need that. So, what is the

49
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:16,779
ore that we want? What is it called? Well, actually we need to go deeper. Holy shit.

50
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:24,970
It stops right here. You didn't build the rest of the roller coaster. I didn't build this.

51
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:34,939
They just here underground. Oh, that's cool. We need Mithril. You ever heard of Mithril before?

52
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:43,209
I'd say it's Mithril. M-I-T-H-R-I. What does it look like? What color is it?

53
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:56,250
It's much lower than this. Come back to the the helivator. Oh, okay. That was part of the wall.

54
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:04,009
He lied about the story. No, I said if I don't play, then I'll tell the funny story.

55
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,810
Oh, look, let me just tell you something.

56
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,899
This is one of the things we need. Is that Mithril? Oh, shit. I can't even get it. He hates that,

57
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:26,420
by the way. He fucking despises that. The I'm shaking the ice in my coffee around the circle

58
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,579
thing is like I may as well be like grabbing his ears and screaming at him. It's awful. It's so

59
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,699
loud. Are you saying like, oh, ha ha, he hates it. Everyone hates it. You guys hate that?

60
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,519
Anybody in here hate that? Do it again for a test. Anyone who wasn't paying attention.

61
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:49,639
Who hates that? Nobody. No, no, not really. Not really. I like that sound. I like it. No,

62
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,779
no, I'm not seeing any yes. I'm sorry. I think you're just being outvoted here.

63
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,250
Outvoted? I thought you said we had to go down further. Not like where? I was wrong. We need

64
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:09,850
to get palladium first. Palladium. Yeah, I'm just I'm right here. You see this orange looking shit.

65
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:17,939
That orange stuff. That stuff is palladium palladium palladium. Yeah, make a joke quick.

66
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,180
I thought you were quicker than this. Make a joke. I don't even make a joke right now.

67
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,579
What is this? This is this is this is the terrible terraria tatterdates. Okay. Why are they terrible?

68
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,710
Oh, shit. I did just say terrible. Didn't I? You did. Is it because it's with me?

69
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:47,750
No, I like terraria. Is it fun? We're just gonna beat the game. What are you doing?

70
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,110
You keep changing your mind. You keep changing your mind on where you want to go.

71
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,110
No, because you're like, oh, we're gonna go deeper. No, we're gonna go here. No,

72
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,269
we need this. We need that one. Actually, we need palladium. No, we need we need mithril.

73
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:13,059
Go back down. Go back up. I just want to I'm just you know, hey guys, so I was I was at the

74
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,299
Dunkin' Donuts drive-through today. And oh my goodness, could I not believe what I saw.

75
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,330
I pull up. I've got a $1 bill in my hand to pay for my small coffee. And what happened? Is that

76
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,460
what you want? Is that what you want me to do? Yeah, please finish the story now. Why can't I

77
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:43,879
jump off? All right, here we go. I did it. Oh, fuck. That's a big wheeze. So guys, I'm at Dunkin'

78
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:52,840
Donuts. And I'm at the drive-through. You really want to like set up squad streams, huh? My chat

79
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:04,889
always tells me to do it. And it's I give them what they want. All right. Squad streams. Okay.

80
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,690
Stuart wants to squad with you. Except I have accepted. Are you gonna be in a mood the whole

81
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:19,830
time today? This is not my fault. All right. How hard can you wheeze without like getting hurt?

82
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,980
I don't know. Like, for instance, like, say something that's like a funny joke.

83
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:41,059
Um, pee pee poo poo. I just hurt my stomach. Yeah, that's gonna hurt me. I don't want to.

84
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:57,110
God damn it. I'm actually I hurt myself. I really just did. I like hurt myself. God damn it. I

85
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,220
didn't even tweet this stream up. Oh, no. You've been really messed up. Is that the title of your

86
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,159
stream too? Terrible Carrara? No, it's called chunky soup stream. What is it? What does that mean?

87
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:29,269
That's it. It's gonna be a long one. It's gonna be a chunky one. Okay, let me tweet this. I'll get

88
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:34,649
back to you in like 10 minutes. I still don't have a magic mirror. I'm leaning back right now to

89
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:40,009
stretch out like my stomach muscles that I just like ripped in half. Okay. All right. So just keep

90
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:47,210
playing. Just make sure just get that that the P or whatever it was. Okay, I'll do everything.

91
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:57,659
But I don't have a thing. I don't have the returno cone. The mirror? Did I get didn't I

92
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:05,529
give that to you last week? I gave it back to you. So do I have it? Let me see. Well, I'm like away

93
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:14,889
from the I'm away from my keyboard right now. Oh, all right. All right. Do I have it? I do. You want

94
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:23,669
it? Uh, should I give it to you? Is this a sign that you're giving up? No, but I mean, you said

95
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:29,590
you here take it. No, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it into this abyss right now. You better

96
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:39,879
catch it. Don't. Will it break if it hits the ground? It'll explode. No, worldwide. Here. How

97
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:46,629
do I throw this to? I don't know. I've never played this game before. Is it not right? Oh,

98
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:53,340
no, no, no, no, no. Okay, I got it. I got it. So I'm gonna keep looking for that or the harm.

99
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,350
I'm looking for the orange or or the other one, right? I'll see what I can only the orange right

100
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:08,500
now. Okay. Only the orange. Only the orange or what's that? Chad, you gotta help me out here to

101
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,120
get the ice hearts. People are saying get the ice hearts. Rune stones. We need those.

102
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,340
Uh, no, we don't. We don't. Oh, right. Didn't you tell me don't ever listen to anybody in chat

103
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,940
for this game? I mean, you can yell at me for that. It's just that there's a decent probability

104
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,059
they'll be wrong or they're really gonna ruin your single player learning experience by spoiling you.

105
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,559
You know, I'm looking for this. Oh, shit. I'm popping a spelunker so we can find this.

106
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,029
Is it in a certain? Is this the biome that it spawns in? It's just everywhere underground.

107
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:04,440
Assuming you've been down here. Usually not. Oh, not a not that deep. Don't go down to hell,

108
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:20,070
you know? No, I'm not in hell right now. No, I'm not right. I am. What the fuck is going on?

109
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:34,919
You stop doing that. I'm trying to. Uh, I don't think it's sitting down here. So this is to get

110
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:40,759
a better pickaxes, right? What you were saying? Uh, yeah. Well, no, it's to get a better pickaxe

111
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:50,950
to get me me thrill to get a me thrill. Yeah. Anvil, which you need to craft like basically

112
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,870
everything. Thanks for thanks for not streaming on my birthday yesterday. I appreciate it.

113
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,899
Happy birthday. You can't say happy birthday birthday was yesterday. He missed it. Well,

114
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:05,179
you don't know that I could be like in Australia. I could be like a full day ahead of you in time

115
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:21,450
zone. So you missed it by two days. I was going to just do a huge wheeze again, but I really hurt

116
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:36,700
myself last time. So I'm not doing that again. It's the stuff I probably have close to enough

117
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:45,269
already. How much do we need? Not much. Just need enough to make a pickaxe so that we can get the

118
00:15:45,269 --> 00:16:03,580
better words. They say go to hell. What would you do? I didn't do anything. Oh, you dynamite.

119
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,279
I'm so glad this is not like Minecraft where you just drop everything. If everything you die with

120
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:16,519
it just stays on the ground. There is a mode for that. Is there like to play that? Um, I don't

121
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:24,169
think I'd like to play that. I would be very bad at that. And then there's hardcore mode.

122
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:36,899
There's a hardcore terrarium mode. Yeah, that's probably insane. I don't see any over here.

123
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,549
I'm just gonna go up. What is all that shit on the mini map? The top, right? All the gold stuff.

124
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:57,620
Is that just sand? Yeah. So it's not up here. It's not up here. I'm gonna go see how much I've got.

125
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:07,779
We cannot get that. Okay. Well, did you check up this way? I'm gonna go see how much I've got.

126
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:17,450
This is lead. Lead's good. You're doing good. I'm proud of you. After doing that wheeze,

127
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,890
this is gonna sound kind of weird and gross, but I I'm gonna have diarrhea in like seven hours.

128
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:27,210
What? Yeah, like it means doing that wheeze, like just turned all the food in my stomach into

129
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,930
diarrhea and it'll be then like another eight to 12 hours. It'll be diarrhea.

130
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:44,680
I liquefied all the fucking stool in my stomach by wheezing. Okay. Germa, I've got the pickaxe.

131
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:54,170
Oh, so that's what chunky means. Oh, oh, oh, whoops. Nevermind. Forget it. Cut me off right now.

132
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,210
Say anything. Do anything. Cut me off right now. What about Hillary's emails?

133
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:08,630
No, worse possible other scenario. Anything else? What is this stuff? Enchanted shard?

134
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:16,730
Uh, that's irrelevant. What? It's irrelevant. It took, uh, yeah, sorry, man. You're wasting your

135
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:25,210
time. I thought I found something cool. I'm sorry. You said this stuff is easy to find. I don't see

136
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:37,140
this shit anywhere. Where are you? It's hitting me. Oh, like the things that we said. Hey, take

137
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:45,720
this pickaxe. Hey, Germa. I know. I know. Give it to me. I'll take it. Okay. Now, you know, like

138
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,279
the pink stuff over here that you see? Yeah. Large palladium pickaxe. Now we can mine the pink stuff.

139
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,160
Really? Oh, we really need it. Which is going to be lower. Is that like a like,

140
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,200
is it like a pogchamp moment? Do I have, is diamonds cool? No, no, no, it's not. Okay.

141
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:14,809
So now we can get this stuff and that will, I have so much trash. Let me get rid of this, um,

142
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:23,500
serpentine, ruby. I feel like all this stuff is good though. Flaming arrow,

143
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:31,059
Jester's arrows, granite block. No, that stuff's trash, right? Granite block is trash. Okay.

144
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,579
Oh, wait, wait, wait, is it? Huh? Huh? Huh? What, what, what, what, what, what?

145
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:56,700
What? It's gone. Are you, are you lying to me? I think this is a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.

146
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:04,140
So we need to, now we can just find the pine, uh, find the pineapples. Yeah. I can't get over

147
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,609
the fucking thing that just happened. Okay. So what, the thing at the Dunkin' Donuts? No,

148
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,809
let me tell you, I'll tell you. Never before have I seen something so funny. Wait, isn't that what

149
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,369
you always tell for a shitty story? You were in line at Dunkin' Donuts. I've heard this before.

150
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:24,730
Yeah. Cause I, you've never finished it. Cause I spend like two thirds of every day at the

151
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:31,799
Dunkin' Donuts drive thru. What's wrong with you? I'm a regular, you know. Do they know your drink?

152
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:42,200
What's your drink? Lodge. That's just a lodge. That's it. Just send me the cup out the window.

153
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,799
I just want to pretend to drink it. I'm supposed to, my doctor told me to cut back on caffeine.

154
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,150
So I still order the coffee, but I just have you give me the empty plastic cup.

155
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:57,210
That sounds awesome. Give me the regular. Who the fuck are you?

156
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:07,269
That's funny. Angry trifold map? What is that? I have to go back to town and I'm throwing something

157
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:19,859
away. Silver ore. Um, all right. I gotta, I gotta disappear for a sec. No, I gave you the, I gave

158
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:29,980
you the mirror. He did. I'm just gonna have to follow you down until you decide. No, I'm going

159
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:38,140
back up. Just go back to the elevator. Yeah. Screw that. What, what is this? Oh, that's like

160
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,339
titanium or whatever it is in this world. It just never ends in Terraria. You know,

161
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:50,500
you're always just doing something. What have you done so far? I'll take the lodge.

162
00:21:50,740 --> 00:22:13,349
All right. I'm going to go back to the elevator. Diaper check. What would that even entail? Hey,

163
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:18,630
oh, hey, dude. Just catching the stream. Diaper check. Is that implying that I turn the webcam

164
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:26,099
on and prove that I have a diaper on? Yeah. Why would you want to know that? Well, no,

165
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:38,630
not that you have a diaper on that it's still clean. Oh my God. Like, we know you have one.

166
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:46,630
Like, we know you have one. Let's check. All right. Can we have, can we like,

167
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:53,829
all right. Welcome to the stream guys. We just started. No more like, like shit diapers and

168
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:58,730
like poo poo jokes. PP poo poo? I know you're going to do that like three or four more times,

169
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,769
but I want to make sure that I put, for the record, I'm not doing them anymore. Okay. Okay.

170
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:12,440
I miss the old German and PP poo poo jokes. So I have, right. I'm going to take some wormhole

171
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:27,099
potions. How many should I take? Three or two? Two. I miss young German. You can't be young

172
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:33,960
forever guys. Don't you understand? I can't wait until you're like 80 years old and you're

173
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,190
streaming and you're just, I'm not going to do that. You know, that's why it'll be fun to watch.

174
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:49,420
I just said that and now everyone's going to freak out. What? No, I knew it. All right. So

175
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,539
I'm coming back down to you. I'm not going to take a wormhole. Why would I? You're just like

176
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:59,579
straight down. Why is there a dino? This is mine? Dying Mountain Dew? What? No, there's like a,

177
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,500
I have like a dinosaur friend following me. Will he, is he going to die if he hits the ground?

178
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:18,599
Hold on. Nope. He didn't die. No, that's bullshit. What? There's a giant clam somewhere again.

179
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:27,769
If you fight it. I don't think I want to do that. It seems to cause a lot of problems.

180
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,500
All right. So where the heck did you go? You went like down. I went left. You know,

181
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:47,450
I'm just getting an ore. You know, I'm, I'm contributing. Yeah. German. Yeah. I'm teleporting

182
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,920
to you. Three, two, one. Just start digging holes. You know, here, you know what? I'm going to give

183
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,119
you some dynamite. Yeah. Give me some of the bombs, man. Here's a hundred, a hundred dynamite.

184
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:02,279
I just threw it right there. Cool. Just start throwing them around. Yeah. Just go wild. All

185
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:14,339
right. Have fun. That's what I'm talking about. Where are they? Right here. All right. All right.

186
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:28,089
Let's go. How to occupy an idiot. Couldn't be in a mood today. I'm in a mood every day.

187
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:45,079
Glad I don't think that's true. You haven't even complained about it being dark ones yet.

188
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:56,940
No, you've changed. All right. I'm going to start firing them down here. Oh, what's this?

189
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,319
Enchanted shard. No, it's the same thing I got last time instead. It wasn't worth it.

190
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:14,630
Yeah. Oh, shit. That's lava. Oh, oh, watch out. What are you doing? What are you doing?

191
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:26,089
Oh, what's over here? I think I found something. Good. I did. Do you see these little

192
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:40,380
purple pinwheels in the air? Uh-huh. Pick those up. Corrupt mimic. Ow. Is that it? They're going to

193
00:26:40,380 --> 00:27:10,970
die. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't die, dude. Stop. Leave me alone. You can't even see that thing on the

194
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:22,730
screen. He's just dumb. How could you even see that? I zoomed my eyes onto it. You see these

195
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:30,970
purple pinwheels? The purple pinwheels. The spinning, glowing purple. Up there. Yes. The

196
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:36,730
soul of light. The soul of night. I got you. So find those. Any reason why they would drop?

197
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:43,130
Oh, killing enemies in this biome drops. You got it. Every enemy around here that's dying

198
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:50,089
that you're killing off the screen. I see a farming the stone. They're all dropping. You got it.

199
00:27:51,529 --> 00:28:06,500
And they're used in like most recipes. Careful. Careful. This is bomb. You ride this fucking dark

200
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:22,019
down here. Dude, seriously? Who made the earth this way? Oh, shit. Did that actually get me?

201
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:34,180
I'm actually so glad that you're playing as the AFK guy. How did you occupy an idiot?

202
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,220
Just any time that you have anything to say like that, just say that.

203
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:46,099
No, like these things that travel through walls and kill things are the like

204
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:53,750
this stage of the game. There's nothing better than another one of those things. These mimics.

205
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,630
You're an idiot. That's what you want. That's how you want people to treat you. Huh? No,

206
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,869
no. The joke is that like that says that's like, that's so overdone. That's like leaving the

207
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:09,509
fucking steak on the grill for three days and you forgot it was on a joke. It's not a joke.

208
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:13,349
That was not the joke. And I think you need a little bit more self-respect. I think I killed

209
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:22,869
the mimic. No, there's another one. Oh my fucking God. I'm just like going you deal with that thing.

210
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:31,980
I killed the last one. Can we not break this stuff? What's this? He's a better axe.

211
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:38,380
I think that's I forget what it's called on this world titanium. Grab that. Grab that stuff in the

212
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,019
lava. That's down there because there's a lot of random shit in there.

213
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:51,579
And then the stuff again down there. Tell me what to do again and see what happens. Go get

214
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:02,869
the items in the lava. Now. What happened? What happened? Oh, worm hook.

215
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:15,029
I have the kind of stupid gel. I don't know. What is it called? It's the one that it's like the

216
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:29,450
right. I can't tell you. I think this one's a little better. I can give it to you if you'd

217
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,569
like it. Maybe. I mean, I'm just I'm doing what you told me to do. I have a lot of these things.

218
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,500
He's in one of those moods today. What's that supposed to mean?

219
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:54,200
No, actually what you're supposed to say is damn Joe. No, no, no. It's how do I occupy an idiot?

220
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:10,660
Dumb. What would my mother think about when you guys say that? I mean, imagine like being my

221
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,039
mother who watches every one of these streams. Does she? German idiot. German so stupid. He's

222
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,609
pretending he's so is he pretending to be this dumb who raised him? I've seen that one a lot.

223
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:44,089
Who raised him? I found some more that stuff. There's a lot of those down there. Am I gonna

224
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:51,829
get hurt by this? Holy shit. That's a lot of stuff. Wow. Wow. Too many too many things. All

225
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:57,480
right. You have me on this kick of pick up all the purple things and I've got a lot of them.

226
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:05,269
Okay, I'm doing so good. Wait, I'm good for what was that on the stuff over here?

227
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:26,569
Oops. I need to get this shit over here. What's that? Granite energy storm.

228
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:39,960
Oh, to me to me. Wait, maybe not. Can I handle this? Yeah, I can. I can handle this.

229
00:32:48,380 --> 00:33:00,710
No, I'm good. What do you drop? Oh shit. Energy manipulator. All right. Hold on.

230
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,910
I'll update it. Oh, Earth Elemental is not what you're killing an Earth Elemental.

231
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,150
Where the fuck am I killing this thing? I just I don't even know what

232
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:35,210
happened. Did I do it? Got him. All right. I need light. This is the or or or

233
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:43,130
Mickey or or orient in the blind. Believe in yourself. What is this stuff? Or

234
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:57,990
or a clicky claim or or it or a shell or a ship or a shell ship. Hey, orange. You're glad it

235
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:06,680
didn't say banana. That's that's good. I think if you come back, we're ready to fight some bosses.

236
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:25,099
Hold on. I'm drowning. He's in one of those boots today. I'm coming back. No, I'm not coming back

237
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:36,300
yet. There's too many treasures. That thing depth meter. Blink root gel. Get rid of this.

238
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:46,539
Okay, I got it. Whatever it is. All right, I'm coming. I'm I dude, I'm like obsessed right now

239
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:53,099

240
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:57,500
something else because like I've got like I probably have 200 days. I have probably 215 of these

241
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:11,079
come back. Okay, I'm coming back. And I told you that a while ago. Did you listen?

242
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:27,110
No, I don't think you did. It's too dark. Okay, I gotta figure out how to make these blocks.

243
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:33,800
All right, I'm coming back with like a ton of stuff. We need souls of light. Fuck souls of

244
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:53,110
light. Souls of light. Anybody else see what's going on? I don't. I'm not drowning. I'm fine.

245
00:35:53,829 --> 00:36:10,570
Drowning pleb. Hey, nice room you got there. Whatever. Drowning pleb. Drowning pleb. Drowning

246
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:18,380
pleb. Hey, relax. And you come back, we're gonna fight a boss. I'm just gonna use my wormhole to

247
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,489
you. I don't care how expensive this is. They're not that expensive.

248
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:36,840
Okay, I have like 150 of these things. I have 35 of them. Put them in storage.

249
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,260
German was slain by a giant clam. I need to look at some of the stuff though because holy shit.

250
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,050
Oh my god. What? It's not that big of a deal. Are you fine?

251
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:58,420
It sounds like you're putting me inside of a washer. I'm summoning this fucking boss. Don't.

252
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:04,260
I seriously have a full inventory. There's a limited night time. I don't want to miss it.

253
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,940
Okay, fine. Do it. I deposited everything. Where are we fighting at? There's a guy outside.

254
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:35,639
What in the name of god is going on with this guy? Dude, this.

255
00:37:40,630 --> 00:38:02,099
There's people that are doing this. I'm trying to stay alive. Ow. I'm dead. Could you not be dead?

256
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:08,500
I have really bad weapons. Let me just do something here called I'm gonna spawn the boss

257
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,980
when you're not ready and I don't even know what this is. It's a worm. How many times have you

258
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:20,969
fought worms before? It shoots fucking portal to turrets everywhere. Is it gonna come in here?

259
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:38,969
It's dead. Did it die like in the wall? No, it died up here. I'm supposed to let you pick

260
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:43,369
things up and look at them and go ooh. Well, I was about to do that and then you said

261
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:57,639
he's in a mood. They really only drop materials to make things.

262
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,500
I picked up a bunch of shit down there and like oh I really want you to look at it.

263
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,260
Hey, I'm spawning the boss now. What? Go. I don't even know what I said. I wanted you to look at

264
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,780
it. When did I say I wanted you to look at it? You just said that I want you to be able to pick

265
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,860
things up and look at it. That's what you just said. You said right now. I didn't say look at them.

266
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:25,739
You said to go ooh ah look at that. What did he all right am I insane or did he not just say I

267
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,739
want Jermba to pick up the items to look at them and go ooh ah am I insane? No, I was talking

268
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:37,400
about the boss and then you were talking about what happened in the freaking hole. I'm talking

269
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:50,230
about both. All right, so that was fun. We have a lot of money. All right, we need souls of light.

270
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:57,880
I picked up a bunch of shit though. I'm not even kidding. You know, you know, look at it at your

271
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:07,639
own souls of you said you said souls of light right light okay souls of flight light souls of

272
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:17,239
flight or souls of flight light okay so not souls of flight souls of flight are also important

273
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:23,639
though okay do you have those there are seven in the inventory yeah in the chop thing yeah I

274
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,320
thought maybe you had found some but there's no way I actually found a beam sword and everyone

275
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,610
I saw like at least 25 pogchamps when I picked it up okay is that good I didn't get a chance to

276
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:44,260
look at it I mean that's what the fuck is that are you kidding me oh you got to be kidding me

277
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:53,179
am I right uh I mean I think I'm not a big fan of the proc rate on this

278
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:13,699
it only procs like once every second I'll load the key quick diaper check one of these days

279
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:21,190

282
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:37,239

week and then you come back and everyone's like what because everyone everyone talks about you

296
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:12,119
at the materials and I want to see what you can turn the beam sword into yeah do that because my

297
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,599
viewers are fucking smart and they want to see combinations and they want to see the intelligence

298
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:25,719
part of the game not just like I throw shoot stuff down in dungeons what's going on steampunker has

299
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,039
awoken and there's like a there's a they're having a party there's a halloween organ being played

300
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:41,059
here's what you do plug in the soul of night into the the guy and uh let's see what you can make

301
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:54,679
well where is what can this turn into solstice claymore my god changes projectile color based

302
00:43:54,679 --> 00:44:01,300
on the time of the year inflicts day broken during the day and night wither during the night

303
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,429
wait is it a blood moon I just told you that it was a bunch of shit going on

304
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:26,630
pirate guy that flips oh this is the okay this is a good event we gotta kill these things kill

305
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:33,420
these things yeah we're looking for broken hero swords and stuff well I just got something pretty

306
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:47,849
cool broken hero swords um what is that I can talk to something up here it's like an angel

307
00:44:54,019 --> 00:45:17,590
menacing moonstone so what eclipse is different than a blood moon oh yeah in there I don't think

308
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:25,480
I ever had a randomly spawned one what's that tesla defibrillator there are too many items in

309
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:36,039
the game I don't know what to do it's too many and you know it's because we're going too fast

310
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:46,469
you know if you're playing with yourself take your time you get to enjoy the experience

311
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:56,469
but I've ruined it that tends to happen whenever you play a game with start you just

312
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:02,949
do the go to 100 immediately but it's also kind of a good thing is if I played this on my own

313
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,869
stream on my own just hey I'm gonna open up terraria and wait that's what we're going to do

314
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:12,550
today there was not only two bosses there would not be any mods I'd probably be at 800 by 600

315
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:19,989
resolution and um I I would dig out but still be in my first spelunking mission going down

316
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,710
I would have picked up like 10 and thought it was cool

317
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:33,000
oh wow there's 10 wow what do I do with 10 okay now we're getting going

318
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:43,340
how long does this last next week all night yeah I've never seen those vampire essence before

319
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:58,820
what's that nothing why is this lady outside vampire essence yeah I've got it too any bosses

320
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:19,289
um there's one mini boss I think episode 54 and 55 of the tin arc yeah and I would have okay I'm

321
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:27,079
gonna be careful in the title of this I just got fucking air shot by that guy I'm gonna die out

322
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:33,849
here you don't even need to be out there just stand by the door indoors and watch them all

323
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:46,230
going for a lot of while your stuff kills them also take the warm up um anyways I was gonna say

324
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:52,869
what was I gonna say oh yeah the episodes would be titled um something funny and pop culture

325
00:47:52,869 --> 00:48:04,329
referencing like uh terraria episode 55 the adventures of tin tin with me getting 10 for

326
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:12,650
like four episodes oh I see what we're going with this and you don't stop getting 10 till

327
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:26,199
you have like 999 okay I understand the minus twos but mine but I didn't that I'm saying that

328
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:35,780
that would be a terrible thing to do I love how you guys you all right you guys like give me like

329
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:44,309
minus twos and plus twos the stuff that I didn't even do if I think about a bad joke it's minus

330
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:54,699
two I can't even it's like I can think about a potential bad piece of humor if I opened up right

331
00:48:54,699 --> 00:49:00,940
now a recipe book no if I opened up a recipe book and read like how how to make like a like

332
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:07,079
how to make the best corn on the cob just the recipe itself would be it would get like a minus

333
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:17,900
two wouldn't be me no German listen those are bots on twitch that just show up and spam minus two

334
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,340
altogether they're all owned by one person and it's an extreme or self-conscious

335
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,900
your joke was actually really funny

336
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:42,230
yeah okay I remember you know like the minus two thing right I was playing Sam and Max a

337
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:47,030
couple weeks ago and jokes that Sam was making in the game they were minus twoing me

338
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:55,190
that's how far we've gone oh yeah that's what I mean it's like it's not even about you it's just

339
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:03,639
it's not even about me anymore I think they thought you made Sam and Max

340
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:23,780
it's you didn't make this this is cool see now now I see plus twos but I made that joke I'm not

341
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:30,980
getting the plus two they're putting in your channel I know there's a whole lot of you know

342
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,579
there needs to be like a regulatory board that oversees the like the plus two and minus two

343
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:47,960
market because it's highly manipulated okay so what do you want to do you didn't get me like

344
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:56,469
broken hero sword I do I'm making archelous do it I don't you know don't you need the thing that I

345
00:50:56,469 --> 00:51:13,449
threw it uh broken sword right I think I deposited one or two of them somebody said broken hero

346
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:23,639
so it drops from moth rom it's the mechanical bosses that drop the broken swords no star is

347
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:33,349
seriously not and he's really stupid star is fucking dumb stars an idiot I have 500 hours in

348
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:55,980
terraria star just is being like annoying that's weird weird yeah it's just kind of weird dude just

349
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:03,030
imagine did I get anything like that was worth using I feel like I'm okay you've got me in this

350
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:10,059
uh in this position where somebody who's in the house uh vampires teleporting which is weird

351
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:16,969
because normally you have to invite vampires and that is true yeah I don't think this game's

352
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:26,409
accurate I feel like everything I pick up is not as good as I have these aliens that go through

353
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:34,230
walls and kill everything well you're a summoner and that's that's your whole point I know if you

354
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:40,469
want to be a magician you have been doing it wrong I know I'm just I'm just saying stir is smart and

355
00:52:40,469 --> 00:53:01,579
handsome and funny yeah whatever oh yeah I have this thing too forgot about this thing this is

356
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:08,300
this is a very long eclipse moon well I mean it's all night and nicer they're pretty long

357
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:16,760
so we just just stay here until they're all until this is over so I'm getting Nancy I mean you can

358
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:23,719
go do whatever you want I'm crafting the god sword and I'm changing my whole terraria build

359
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,289
if you can even imagine what's going on in my head right now

360
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,340
oh

361
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,940
these things are really good too and this is not even a summon this is a sentry

362
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,900
I'm star boy now oh you actually made it yeah that thing looks pretty insane

363
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:10,789
it's melee damage go get him very colorful yeah just brighten everything up

364
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:17,190
for her just in case anyone wanted to be able to see what was happening on the screen

365
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:24,789
who's the next boss um we have to summon we need the souls of light to get the last mechanical

366
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:33,829
boss okay so after this moon is over we're going to go get the mechanical um dust whatever the

367
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:44,809
hell the thing is uh light dust I want to make you a hallowed uh staff hallowed staff

368
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:59,420
I really want to replace the sans head I forgot how to make it yeah I'm getting I'm just gonna

369
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:04,940
store the sans head I don't like it I'd rather just do this this thing is cool too

370
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:18,710
yeah I like this thing better oh you got a tentacle oh yes oh yeah

371
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:29,929
it really not that great though is the eldritch tomb a summoner weapon

372
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:38,460
um no I don't think so I think it's just I mean technically it's a summoner weapon but

373
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:46,699
it's a material though what can I do with this what can I do with it this is the auger the

374
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:50,619
elements very fast average knockback burst of elements the tentacles to spear your enemies

375
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:56,780
yeah it's just like a better version of it what does it take tomb of fates and what can I do with

376
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:08,150
that how do I get a tomb of fates shadow form hex doll galactica singularity humanite bar all right

377
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:18,980
can you please what can I do with that is there a mod list yeah uh if you do exclamation point

378
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:28,139
mod but maybe not anymore it was there before hey wait a second what can I do with that

379
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:36,300
you leave me alone I'm just playing terraria look at this thing cosmic immaterializer

380
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:49,079

01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:49,539
I got really obsessed with this 10-hour ayaya video we can't invade anymore this is quality

452
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:55,399

466
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:47,000

467
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,760
no I was just doing I was grinding um for those um flight emblems whatever the hell

468
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:01,560
it the bowls of the flight emblems the flight um gift of flight now that's a youtube video

469
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:14,470
that I don't need it um okay soul of flight oh you've been getting souls how many do you have

470
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:24,039
a 40 oh we only need it like 20 well we got plenty they're in the deposit box hey go to the

471
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:30,199
craftman crash show him the soul of flight you got it and check out find a wing that you think you

472
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:36,840
can create I think we have dragon scales we have we have some other feathers dragon blast but yeah

473
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:43,560
we're gonna we're gonna make wings dude angel wings demon wings fairy wings harpy wings

474
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:49,640
butterfly wings bone wing flame wing frozen wings I feel like I've had buffalo wild wings right now

475
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,439
you are this is a this is a list of like how hot they are and have like the different seasonings

476
01:12:54,439 --> 01:13:04,420
that are on them yeah okay bee wings I've got this hitter and read them all well no just find

477
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:11,060
one that you can make based like okay feather soul flight 20 soul of light we have 25 soul light

478
01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:19,590
no soul of light is what I'm looking for right now demon wings I think are probably the easiest

479
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:27,340
demon wings also they need soul of night yeah we have a lot of those so what's the difference

480
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,590
are they all the same exact thing except all right what about um the ones that we can make

481
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:41,189
are basically all the same we have pixie dust because fairy wings are also available uh there's

482
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:50,439
like four or five harpy wings I guess the it's just speed flight time yeah demon wings are the

483
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:56,380
ones we can make because we need soul of night we need one more soul of flight because uh this

484
01:13:56,779 --> 01:14:04,020
39 they take 40 what they take it's 20 soul of flight to make one demon wing so you're gonna

485
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:14,420
need one too right oh there's a frozen feather in the storage is that what do we need a frozen

486
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:26,439
feather can make uh better wings oh shit really better demon wings oh ice okay oh shit yeah so we

487
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:35,369
have an ice feather so who wants the frozen wings which which ones which ones do you want

488
01:14:35,369 --> 01:14:38,890
I was thinking look I'll get like a couple and you get a couple and we'll split them

489
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:44,250
rock paper scissors shoot I was gonna get two bone wings uh two frozen wings and then

490
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,850
if you get the you get the flame wings and the butterfly wings we can you can have some mine

491
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:56,329
okay but which one do you actually want whichever one's faster that's the frozen one so I'm just

492
01:14:56,329 --> 01:15:11,529
gonna make it and give two okay um we don't we don't actually have a frozen feather do we

493
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:18,090
what's going on here we have some ice feather um we actually both can have ice wings because

494
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:26,779
we have two okay yeah I remembered finding a bunch okay cool so um which which one of

497
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:54,619
okay I mean whatever you say what are these what is equipped to is this like an accessory um yeah

498
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:59,420

690
01:51:39,689 --> 01:51:45,829
screen and releases like 30 little ads that shoot lasers in every direction yeah so what

691
01:51:45,829 --> 01:51:51,899
you're like sad that you can't avoid all those lasers he's still using sans laser in hard mode

692
01:51:51,899 --> 01:52:04,409
what a casual is that a casual thing to do I want to get you the hallowed scepter thingy but I don't

01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:24,579
took them yeah okay 55 magic damage slow speed very weak knockback summons a barrage of enchanted

696
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:36,279
swords at the mouse cursor's location 56 versus 55 uh the really good thing about that is you can

697
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:42,199
cast it through walls in the ground which also shows you if you want to find uh nice sources

698
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:46,279
but also that multi hits like crazy like if we fight that here you know what we're gonna do it

699
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:51,720
we're gonna fight that boss again just so you can see how much damage you freaking do

700
01:52:54,569 --> 01:53:08,020
okay wow because it hits every single segment with all those that is pretty insane

701

854
02:23:18,299 --> 02:23:23,979
to be honest because sometimes you can lose your cursor very easily yeah but I don't want to use

an accessory slot for like nothing uh I get I'm ready when you are yeah you actually might be at

856
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:47,590
the point where you need new armor but I don't know if any of the current armors give as many

857
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:55,819
summons as that one does uh so I don't know which armor would be good for you uh I'm summoning boss

981
02:50:56,979 --> 02:51:01,719
there any reason to use the pick over the drill uh the drill is just annoying

982
02:51:22,819 --> 02:51:27,540
oh we can't even use life fruit yet I think we have to use like going down

983
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:32,979
too far or this is like new b biome what's that no just it's like a little guy crap

984
02:51:33,780 --> 02:52:02,659
oh we're gonna queen bee so need my honeycomb I see honeycomb I see it unless that was something

985
02:52:02,659 --> 02:52:12,860
else I think I'm out of no room you didn't get any drops from it I think I'm out of space

986
02:52:14,219 --> 02:52:19,579
I got everything but I did not get honeycomb uh tin ore get out of here

987
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:43,270
I have seeds I need that right should I eat the heart now but should I wait

988
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:50,059
oh you can't eat it yet wait you need to get 400 health and then there's some other step

989
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:59,940
that I'm not I think I know what it is let's throw the bomb it would be really easy to get 400 health

990
02:52:59,940 --> 02:53:06,579
by the way if you want to go do that while I'm looking for the bulb um where's the best place

991
02:53:06,579 --> 02:53:12,979
to get that the fire stuff uh so you go down to hell then go left okay you know how there's

992
02:53:12,979 --> 02:53:19,500
like a ceiling to hell yes they kind of there's five flame hearts that just kind of line the

993
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:27,540
ceiling uh I had been left and right and gotten a lot of them so a lot of them are gone but it's

994
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:39,370
just above hell very slightly okay so just get down to hell yeah go left though I I got more

995
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:56,540
from on the right than I did on the left what's that there's no hearts in here I put the um I put

996
02:53:56,540 --> 02:54:11,659
that life the the life root it's in the storage is that one oh I found a bulb find blazing hearts

997
02:54:11,659 --> 02:54:24,440
all right I'll go do that I'm going to hell I wait what you did I just assumed I was at full health

998
02:54:25,079 --> 02:54:32,979
apparently not I want like some red glows on you know how like you get shot very much appreciate

999
02:54:32,979 --> 02:54:39,379
that so you're saying get down to hell and then go left and just look for them the ceiling above

1000
02:54:39,379 --> 02:54:42,979
hell so like if you're on the platform you're not going to be able to see it you kind of have

1001
02:54:42,979 --> 02:54:51,129
to check the ceiling they're like very they're like right there let me see what you mean by that

1002
02:54:51,129 --> 02:54:57,420
let's see if I can figure it out because this is hell right I think I'm in there I think I'm

1003
02:54:57,420 --> 02:55:03,020
at hell now right is that not quite the place with all the lava yes at the bottom

1004
02:55:03,819 --> 02:55:17,260
yeah I know but but like is hell very large yeah people say no go further down oh yeah yeah all

1005
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:53,299
the way at the bottom okay all right so then you say go left um why can't I jump okay I'm good all

1006
02:55:53,299 --> 02:56:13,479
right looking for blazing hearts I'm on it dude I love Edward Elric I just found the philosopher's

1008
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:35,370
and show me what it means to be a boy you just like said words you won't even think you just

1009
02:56:35,370 --> 02:56:47,079
said words out loud you didn't it doesn't matter what they were exactly call that word soup oh my

1010
02:56:47,079 --> 02:57:14,620
god Edward L for looking for it what happened you couldn't put the fire out fire oh I can't

1011
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:27,479
stand on those right all right okay never mind yeah forgot about that yeah maybe next time put

1012
02:57:27,479 --> 02:57:55,829
the fire out all right let's do it again die again this weapon is not fun underground

1013
02:57:57,909 --> 02:58:01,750
don't I can't stand for some reason I just thought they were the same material here

1014
02:58:02,309 --> 02:58:19,450
almost got me again with that little trap door all right do not stand on these it doesn't work

1015
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:41,780
that way I kind of need to go over here though what is it can I even do anything over here

1016
02:58:41,780 --> 02:59:06,780
I'm gonna go up where's my rope oh yeah oh I should hydrate it by now I haven't drank water

1017
02:59:06,780 --> 02:59:17,340
all day have you really not what's wrong with you yeah I mean I had a little nothing anything

1018
02:59:17,340 --> 02:59:33,260
up in here nothing up in here um it's possible that I got them all I think if we also have

1019
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:38,379
all stone you can you can craft them I mean there's probably some somewhere but like if you went to a

1020
02:59:38,379 --> 02:59:43,420
different world and it got down to hell really quickly you'd find them immediately is all I'm

1021
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:50,469
saying a lot of cool things in here yeah we just like went to our own separate servers and like

1022
02:59:50,469 --> 02:59:57,379
didn't play together well there's definitely nothing else here heart statue does that do

1023
02:59:57,379 --> 03:00:16,180
anything some just do things but no just ignore them now anybody see anything I don't see anything

1024
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:54,739
all right all right nothing but there are some magma blocks up here that I'm gonna get

1025
03:00:56,920 --> 03:01:03,500
like I was just saying if you're desperate just mine health stone like if you really can't find

1026
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:15,290
anything I'm sure I gotta go further over this way I'm gonna accidentally summon plantara isn't

1027
03:01:15,290 --> 03:01:24,090
that on you not on me yeah what what yeah I can't summon plantara down here I said I I swear I'm

1028
03:01:24,090 --> 03:01:28,250
going to accidentally summon planter and then you were like already got defensive

1029
03:01:31,209 --> 03:01:38,100
don't make me laugh not when there's all lava underneath me it wasn't a joke it was like

1030
03:01:38,100 --> 03:02:00,549
the court recording of what happened this uh magma turtle worth anything

1031
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:16,299
to a zoo I have no idea what do they look like you'll you'll know when you see it

1032
03:02:16,299 --> 03:02:20,700
it really is like a heart with a I know I know I know right I I'm just being an idiot

1033
03:02:21,260 --> 03:02:50,100
okay what do they look like you got me can't mine this I don't even know why I'm mining

1034
03:02:50,100 --> 03:03:17,659
chlorophyte because I don't think any of us are gonna use it these are really helpful though

1035
03:03:17,659 --> 03:03:42,780
just like peruse an area let's go up I'm thinking up yeah so one heart is 20 health right yeah

1036
03:03:43,579 --> 03:03:51,260
if you found any I just need one more okay I'm at planter's bulb one more we'll do it

1037
03:03:56,680 --> 03:04:01,530
dude diapers lol I'm not saying it

1038
03:04:06,899 --> 03:04:38,360
ow found it got one okay teleport to me now I gotta get it first blazing heart

1039
03:04:43,940 --> 03:04:50,379
teleport to you I need to go back to the base first that's important

1040
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:55,420
I also found this weird like ribbon candy storium

1041
03:05:00,969 --> 03:05:19,079
all right let's go back where's this diaper thing

1042
03:05:21,959 --> 03:05:28,200
it's a good joke all right so permanently increases life by 10 I thought you said it

1043
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:39,620
gave me 20 oh I just assumed well I need two more apparently well we can do that after

1044
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:49,139
I can do that later and again you can craft it with hellstone and we should have the stuff

1045
03:05:49,139 --> 03:05:56,260
to do that I would look into that before you go on another goose chase hellstone brick or hellstone

1046
03:05:56,260 --> 03:06:19,879
like no no not brick right hellstone bars lava bat banner no I thought that was bacon do you

1047
03:06:19,879 --> 03:06:32,889
need uh hermes boots or anything I just put them in the storage no link root seeds trash trash

1048
03:06:32,889 --> 03:06:52,739
what about the mario hat auto trash and actually is a mario hat 20 restoration posters that's not

1051
03:07:16,739 --> 03:07:32,340
potion wormhole potion and I am coming ready hi hi fly up here

1052
03:07:33,940 --> 03:07:43,510
I'm gonna finish this and we could probably just start it I think are strong enough

1053
03:07:45,559 --> 03:07:57,270
to not have to worry so this thing is scary uh a little bit this is our up and down safety net so

1054
03:07:57,270 --> 03:08:03,819
kite it up and down rather than across the plank and I need some open space there for my bow to

1055
03:08:03,819 --> 03:08:12,620
even work look diaper check ban the word diaper I end this nightmare ban the word diaper add diaper

1056
03:08:12,620 --> 03:08:43,879
to like the not show up in the chat let's just do it you better be ready I'm ready weird that they

1057
03:08:43,879 --> 03:08:56,569
always go for you

1058
03:09:01,610 --> 03:09:15,110
but I got to the om part that was really not that hard yeah no it's falling oh mo

1059
03:09:15,190 --> 03:09:25,620
oh that was it's oh no with an m apparently a temple key what's that uh temples the next

1060
03:09:25,620 --> 03:09:30,500
thing we have to do that's actually we should do while we're here if your inventory isn't

1061
03:09:31,299 --> 03:09:37,159
uh I just got rid of everything okay well then we need to find the entrance to the temple which

1062
03:09:37,159 --> 03:09:45,030
is that like the bottom right of the jungle usually okay uh do you get anything else

1063
03:09:45,909 --> 03:09:55,670
let's see uh energy core honey block bloom weave bud bomb plantera uh boost item grab range

1064
03:09:56,309 --> 03:10:02,309
rocket living shard temple key quick grenade launcher this thing is insane

1065
03:10:03,510 --> 03:10:11,340
I think it uses a grenade ammo other than that not really I don't think

1066
03:10:12,139 --> 03:10:28,979
oh yeah now illuminate so we're just gonna kind of dig down to stay within this area

1067
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:44,940
yeah it's like the dungeon but the bricks are like orange that's it right here oh all right

1068
03:10:44,940 --> 03:10:47,739
but we can't dig through it so we have to find the actual front door

1069
03:10:48,940 --> 03:11:08,790
I'm assuming the front door is uh down oh no it's at the top top oh just keep going to the right

1070
03:11:08,870 --> 03:11:15,850
I'm mining this stuff I'll be with you oh this is it right here the door is in lava

1071
03:11:16,969 --> 03:11:23,780
uh there can we do anything about that uh you can take a little bit of damage

1072
03:11:24,659 --> 03:11:30,920
or if you have a lava immunity charm on you I don't how do we open the door you're gonna

1073
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:42,059
have to dig through the obsidian walk to the lava easy easy oh wait wait wait wait wait wait let's

1074
03:11:42,059 --> 03:12:00,709
do this I threw a grenade down be careful okay grenades don't hurt people don't go down there

1075
03:12:10,860 --> 03:12:12,860
that's like a really bad construction yard

1076
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:21,450
hey watch out don't go over there yeah we're also gonna have lunch underneath it

1077
03:12:24,649 --> 03:12:26,969
okay you just need to man up and go open the door

1078
03:12:27,370 --> 03:12:37,979
ah okay okay wait wait wait wait wait what what what's going on what do you mean wait

1079
03:12:37,979 --> 03:12:44,379
everywhere there's like the walls are shooting at you right now okay just chill just chill

1080
03:12:48,899 --> 03:12:52,899
okay the enemies down here kind of hurt there's a whole bunch of them there's spikes along the walls

1081
03:12:52,899 --> 03:13:01,239
full inventory ammo what are you lizard door I don't want a lizard door I'm so mad that I have

1082
03:13:01,239 --> 03:13:15,860
this I'm just getting rid of all this shit fuck this stuff what oh what's going on here

1083
03:13:17,459 --> 03:13:23,860
okay the one thing you really need to watch out for down here is there's spikes that shoot

1084
03:13:23,860 --> 03:13:27,860
there's dart traps but also there's these like spike things that drop from the ceiling

1085
03:13:28,420 --> 03:13:32,100
and they bounce up and down and they do a lot more damage than it looks like they do

1086
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:39,860
got it and then there's a boss one at the bottom how do we how do the traps activate though

1087
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:44,500
that's the big question for me floor pressure tracks that are very hard to see

1088
03:13:46,100 --> 03:13:56,280
if you like you see those faces on the left wall on the right wall

1089
03:13:57,319 --> 03:14:02,040
these two little blocks these are trapped by the way dude I just I just walked over here in my

1090
03:14:02,040 --> 03:14:08,680
inventory got full again like you know this is insane this is too what do we do with this stuff

1091
03:14:17,399 --> 03:14:27,159
I got 50 100 rockets if you're being used I don't know what I don't know what to do

1092
03:14:27,159 --> 03:14:33,079
you understand go back to the base go back to the base recall put your stuff in the storage then

1093
03:14:33,079 --> 03:14:41,000
wormhole back to me and then we can stop arguing it's insane it's it's too many things to have to

1094
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:49,319
keep track of um some of the one of these things is really really good though it was a lot of

1095
03:14:49,319 --> 03:15:02,309
damage what was it I was in my inventory magic dagger insanely fast attack speed

1096
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:36,790
I'm coming what oh god what did I do I press b wins goss after this is it safe to go in here

1097
03:15:38,299 --> 03:15:46,579
what is safe to go in here yeah just be very careful I'm just not touching the ground

1098
03:15:47,780 --> 03:15:53,639
oh see those are the spikes healing things I'm just standing up here

1099
03:15:54,600 --> 03:16:11,270
could you describe what was going on right now to somebody that didn't that doesn't know what's

1100
03:16:11,270 --> 03:16:18,790
going on um we're inside the lizard temple that has been closed for centuries

1101
03:16:22,329 --> 03:16:26,010
and we're we're here to you know stop the prophecy

1102
03:16:26,649 --> 03:16:37,129
mm-hmm as best we can what is this duck quacking song those are the lizards oops

1103
03:16:41,690 --> 03:16:47,530
we're also they drop a very specific item oh no there's chests down here that we need they

1104
03:16:47,530 --> 03:16:55,620
usually have the thing in it I can't open this because I'm already in it yeah I don't have any

1105
03:16:55,620 --> 03:17:01,459
space open that chest and top left there's a power fragment which is what we need to fight the boss

1108
03:17:48,440 --> 03:17:54,360
all right I'm gonna be real the last probably 25 times I looked at chat there was probably

1109
03:17:54,360 --> 03:18:04,059
eight messages saying like look at something there was like a diaper comment what what can

1110
03:18:04,059 --> 03:18:08,780
you say your chat loves diapers so that's you should do like a sponsored deal with like a

1111
03:18:08,780 --> 03:18:16,040
diaper company so what are we doing with that altar over there we are clearing the room of

1112
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:23,209
traps first so just activate all the traps no you have to like actually pickaxe and destroy them off

1113
03:18:23,209 --> 03:18:56,500
the wall oh don't worry you just wait I'm doing it I'll do it I can do it oh look out a spider

1114
03:18:57,819 --> 03:19:09,270
okay so uh this one thing is up here you want the explanation or you want to be surprised um

1115
03:19:10,229 --> 03:19:17,190
go ahead and uh just what should I be aware of uh it's a big rock man big rock this it jumps up

1116
03:19:17,190 --> 03:19:22,709
into the air and tries to land on you the first phase is fairly self-explanatory don't get jumped

1117
03:19:22,709 --> 03:19:28,870
on and then the golem's head pops off and flies around and shoots at you okay I'm ready okay you

1118
03:19:28,870 --> 03:19:38,409

1120
03:20:08,100 --> 03:20:30,420
that weapon is pretty terrible for this so what you would be targeting here like what

1121

1350
04:08:15,610 --> 04:08:21,690
button that can tell you who to tell someone to live there okay so I just gotta make a square in

1351
04:08:21,690 --> 04:08:27,290
the jungle with a door and then say I want this guy over here yeah let me let me figure out the

1352
04:08:27,290 --> 04:08:42,360
recipe for the um instant house um why do I not have this scary mask increases your minion size

1353

gold there we go I'll take a hundred of it no more than that I'll take a hundred it's fine you only

1357
04:09:26,700 --> 04:09:31,770
need the pigby staff in your inventory they had people saying don't listen to chat they're wrong

1358
04:09:32,649 --> 04:09:40,469
do we have a pigby staff I've never seen one I mean if I found one I would have destroyed it

1359
04:09:43,559 --> 04:09:54,040
one percent fucking melee speed really I have to go reroll this bewitching table we already have

1360
04:09:54,040 --> 04:10:02,629
one of these right uh we can fight plantera again to get it I can get the portable oh shit this isn't

1361
04:10:02,629 --> 04:10:09,379
what I thought it was summons plantera so what we want you want to fight plantera again I mean we

1362
04:10:09,379 --> 04:10:13,540
can do that yeah should I just go find a bulb though it's right here this is 20 gold portable

1363
04:10:14,340 --> 04:10:21,139
oh okay do you want to fight plantera I mean if if all I need is this if if if plantera drops

1364
04:10:21,139 --> 04:10:30,569
the pigby staff that's all I need to go like and buy it whatever he has uh hold on I don't they

1365
04:10:30,569 --> 04:10:33,209
would I don't think this is this is not a jubade I don't think they would do this to me right now

1366
04:10:33,930 --> 04:10:45,139
oh where's the guy that rerolls yeah yeah you need the pigby staff that's so much money to

1367
04:10:45,139 --> 04:10:58,809
reroll this it costs one platinum and 50 gold to buy the armor set is this no so is this this

1368
04:10:58,809 --> 04:11:05,989
this actually I know how sometimes it's like it's an accessory but it's a mask it's it's just and

1369
04:11:05,989 --> 04:11:18,969
it's an it's actually an accessory so I'm gonna have to remove the uh the fear monger all right

1370
04:11:18,969 --> 04:11:26,729
10 million damage minion size let's see how big they are now oh my god this is gonna be obnoxious

1371
04:11:27,450 --> 04:11:30,889
you're not gonna want to know you're not gonna want to need to you're gonna have hate standing

1372
04:11:30,889 --> 04:11:43,639
near me okay yeah so 25 chance to drop from plantera look at how big these are that's it

1373
04:11:43,639 --> 04:11:49,620
there's a there's a summon later that you can get after um after the cultists and you do some other

1374
04:11:49,620 --> 04:11:56,469
stuff that every time you summon it adds to the length of a dragon right so it's just one big

1375
04:11:56,469 --> 04:12:03,670
long dragon depending on how many summons you have it would look pretty funny that big what did I just

1376
04:12:03,670 --> 04:12:10,729
do what'd you just do I don't know I deleted a hunt I deleted 100 fucking coins somehow

1377
04:12:13,930 --> 04:12:16,010
that's pretty good how's that possible what just happened

1378
04:12:17,290 --> 04:12:26,840
you do it again you show me how you do it well I do I think I just oh I made a platinum coin

04:40:41,299 --> 04:41:00,860
but I guess I'll keep the rope uh all right uh what's next um we never found the dungeon chest

1519
04:41:01,500 --> 04:41:09,689
before that's right we did one thing didn't lie about dos no we're still gonna do it I already

1520
04:41:09,689 --> 04:41:15,049
got it ready I was prepared I have at least a couple of games on dos ready after this

1521
04:41:15,930 --> 04:41:31,270
just I'm gonna go to the bathroom get some water after this and we'll go all right soldiers what

1522
04:41:31,270 --> 04:41:50,180
do you say nightbot died oh oh well so was are you are you have any stingers are you like baking

1523
04:41:50,180 --> 04:41:57,220
a cake or you have any stingers yes I have put them in the the box okay we're gonna fight this

1524
04:41:57,220 --> 04:42:15,659
boss fight this boss the plague bringer goliath okay I think we can just summon it here I'm also

1525
04:42:15,659 --> 04:42:29,909
just realizing these guys are 150 larger so they're just like huge um I can't summon them

1526
04:42:30,549 --> 04:42:44,139
it might have to be daytime or something daytime or something whatever that means oh we have to go

1527
04:42:44,139 --> 04:42:49,900
to the jungle I love going to the jungle we always seem to have to do that huh do they fly with me

1528
04:42:50,869 --> 04:43:03,700
ha ha ha they like they find little broomsticks they just annihilated that thing whatever it was

1529
04:43:03,700 --> 04:43:09,369
I don't even know what it is oh shit we're doing this come back to me come back to me

1530
04:43:11,900 --> 04:43:18,790
the martians are invading this gives you some crazy fucking op items but uh spaceships are

1531
04:43:18,790 --> 04:43:25,270
really tricky we're not strong enough for this not okay well why do we do it then because

1532
04:43:26,229 --> 04:43:32,500
when we kill the spaceships the reason why you're digging so far down here I'm stronger than we are

1533
04:43:32,500 --> 04:43:38,220
right now what's the point of this bunker uh because spaceships shoot down laser beams like

1534
04:43:38,220 --> 04:43:47,369
independence day and they can't go this is a just in case or okay zerg potion

1535
04:43:50,409 --> 04:43:58,180
you're thinking about it that's the thing I am you're thinking about it work you just got your

1536
04:43:58,259 --> 04:44:06,279
armor right yes oh he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna zerg potion with the aliens

1537
04:44:07,240 --> 04:44:16,250
and we're gonna die in 15 seconds you only have to spawn apparently the zerg potion is too much

1538
04:44:16,250 --> 04:44:23,959
I would do like battle but zerg was just there is a block of enemies it really is pickling

1539
04:44:28,330 --> 04:44:33,209
um they're coming it takes time invasion doesn't end until you kill them all

1540
04:44:34,869 --> 04:44:45,500
oh I see you oh yeah I do see you over there I mean they're flying around all over

1541
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:49,900
the place how come where why are they not over here all the invasions like warn you before they

1542
04:44:49,900 --> 04:45:01,209
show up you need to go to spawn they attack the houses no I'd be at spawn they everyone's

1543
04:45:01,209 --> 04:45:15,189
saying we have to be at spawn okay I've seen them not at home here they are oh also you can get the

1544
04:45:15,189 --> 04:45:18,069
OP UFO mount that just lets you fly forever

1545
04:45:22,580 --> 04:45:29,020
so we could be outside of them you find them um okay I'm building another bunker

1546
04:45:36,520 --> 04:45:42,650
oh I just got juggled so bad I have the perfect weapon for this actually

1547
04:45:44,310 --> 04:46:18,599
get off there guys watch out don't get killed um I used it why did you do that they're gonna get in

1548
04:46:19,560 --> 04:46:22,540
they're gonna get in don't let them

1549
04:46:36,889 --> 04:46:41,979
they're in they're in they've breached

1550
04:47:08,650 --> 04:47:15,689
stuff's gonna start to de-spawn isn't it I one of us has to go up there

1551
04:47:17,619 --> 04:47:22,340
one of us has to go up there dude and like get something what are you talking about

1552
04:47:23,220 --> 04:47:27,299
isn't she gonna de-spawn there's gonna be 10 000 things yes there is everyone's saying yes there is

1553
04:47:27,299 --> 04:48:04,299
oh well yeah go get it what my inventory's full I got something thank you can we do it

1554
04:48:04,299 --> 04:48:15,659
oh we are the valiant infantry I love how you very reluctantly joined in

1555
04:48:16,459 --> 04:48:21,830
well the what the correct way to do that would be for you to start and then me to start very

1556
04:48:21,830 --> 04:48:26,549
loudly after you and then somebody else to do it too yeah and then like six more show up

1557
04:48:27,349 --> 04:48:31,990
oh we are the oh oh we are the valiant in inventory tree we're the one

1558
04:48:34,549 --> 04:48:42,220
that's always how it works so what the hell did we just get for doing that

1559
04:48:42,220 --> 04:48:55,110
that's I got the bard triangle shield generator lane electro rebounder martian uniform torso

1560
04:48:58,439 --> 04:49:10,459
no I like the rank code green slime shield drone beacon I gotta start yeah you got everything

1561
04:49:10,459 --> 04:49:13,099
I have to start from the top man this is like too much me to even look at

1562
04:49:14,279 --> 04:49:22,840
healing someone's a shield drone rapidly laser drill I got the same thing is the shield drone

1563
04:49:22,840 --> 04:49:28,119
beacon any good someone's a shield drone to rapidly shield allies shields ally life equal

1564
04:49:28,119 --> 04:49:44,549
to your bones healing up to 25 only one shoulder guardian maybe someone at once wingman fires a

1565
04:49:44,549 --> 04:50:02,520
concentrated laser beam oh man yeah holy shit this thing's awesome yeah aliens get a lot of

1566
04:50:02,520 --> 04:50:07,740
really cool items these are a lot of mana but the thing is great is that the one where you charge

1567
04:50:07,740 --> 04:50:15,500
up it's like it just shoots a beam no it just shoots a rapid just straight line oh there's

1568
04:50:15,500 --> 04:50:19,659
one that charges and then shoots a straight line super beam that's really cool it's kind of like

1569
04:50:19,659 --> 04:50:23,819
the sans eye thing the skeleton thing but it happens immediately and can happen way more often

1570
04:50:23,819 --> 04:50:37,220
it does more damage yeah you can upgrade wingman like 60 times really I have the illuminati weapon

1571
04:50:37,220 --> 04:50:41,619
you know triangles are actually a source of power it's in the shape it's like that's why they use

1572
04:50:41,619 --> 04:50:56,250
the pyramid you need two wing men this thing shoots three of the same time yeah all right

1573
04:50:56,889 --> 04:51:04,650
what about some of this other stuff let me see the shield should i just maybe just use this

1574
04:51:05,610 --> 04:51:14,729
does it count as something and i only have let me see um banners

1575
04:51:17,000 --> 04:51:27,110
i'm gonna get me in trouble if i put this in there there's still a pit

1576
04:51:27,349 --> 04:51:28,709
what are you looking for uh what

1577
04:51:35,380 --> 04:51:41,130
deflect enemy projectiles everything i don't understand

1578
04:51:43,450 --> 04:51:55,319
shield drone i already have one of these but whatever uh cactus leaf desert feather talon

1579
04:51:55,319 --> 04:52:03,860
i don't really know what this is for i don't even want to open the presents i don't care

1580
04:52:04,740 --> 04:52:11,540
all right let's go check out let's see what this shield thing does i don't think it's going to do

1581
04:52:11,540 --> 04:52:17,240
anything unless you actually have bonus healing like you have stat points or items going towards

1582
04:52:17,240 --> 04:52:23,319
that i guess but i don't think it's it's not technically a summon but is it no it's not a

1583
04:52:23,319 --> 04:52:29,689
century either i could i could just have it does it matter do i have zero i can just kind of have

1584
04:52:29,689 --> 04:52:41,930
it here i guess it doesn't matter i guess not it's cute i guess it is just kind of cute what's

1585
04:52:41,930 --> 04:52:49,540
what's the harm uh where it come here let me see oh you're all the way out there i was gonna say

1586
04:52:49,540 --> 04:53:02,650
i forgot why i came this way i had a very good reason i need to start to look i know that for

1587
04:53:02,650 --> 04:53:12,409
you we need to kill the um so that's the cryogen and calamity mod gives you a really crazy century

1588
04:53:12,409 --> 04:53:16,090
uh ability it gives you a whole bunch of really good stuff but mostly that

1589
04:53:16,889 --> 04:53:28,650
all right we should be able to do it though so you want to do that or how do you what's what's

1590
04:53:28,650 --> 04:53:32,009
your uh what's your what's your plan here are you you said that you didn't want to go that long

1591
04:53:32,569 --> 04:53:37,909
i changed my mind it's toraria man once you're in it you're in it because it's been you know it's

1592
04:53:37,909 --> 04:53:43,590

1595
04:57:27,860 --> 04:57:33,479
well that's good let's test it on the pig

1596
04:57:39,000 --> 04:57:51,799
this thing is absolutely destructive what is the alien laser beam oh yeah oh yeah

1597
04:57:53,290 --> 04:57:56,970
yeah yeah yeah yeah all right so i have the solo tablet was it what was i don't even remember

1598
04:57:56,970 --> 04:58:04,250

1600
04:58:12,090 --> 04:58:16,569
that's during the daytime we were going to go to the jungle to fight like bring her goliath

1601
04:58:17,689 --> 04:58:22,009
and then i saw the martian thing on the way broken hero staff right okay so let's go back

1602
04:58:22,009 --> 04:58:36,779
to the jungle uh you head there and i'll teleport to you okay touch the table bring out one of my

1603
04:58:37,799 --> 04:59:04,139
guys and away we go i love all these friends they just surf on their spirits great and then

1604
04:59:04,139 --> 04:59:09,740
sometimes they all just collectively look down and go kill it they all just do a dive down and

1605
04:59:09,740 --> 04:59:19,299
kill the things there okay uh jungle i have acquired the jungle it's dark down here

1606
04:59:20,180 --> 04:59:37,159
okay i'm gonna get over here oh hey here's a plague bringer hey why did we did we walk over here

1607
04:59:37,159 --> 04:59:46,169
if five seconds ago i might as well just spawn one i didn't buy any potions this guy might be

1608
04:59:46,169 --> 05:00:07,139
a little tricky platforms or anything uh i do not i do not we should be fine nice water

1609
05:00:07,299 --> 05:00:18,889
fall thanks whoa what did you summon this yeah okay it's a lot stronger than i thought it would be

1610
05:00:20,330 --> 05:00:29,880
this is like end game level shit at least in terms of damage it deals if it hits you

1611
05:00:34,580 --> 05:00:38,500
he's really fast poison too

1612
05:00:38,500 --> 05:00:44,869
too

1613
05:01:10,979 --> 05:01:20,259
38% though that's not terrible yeah i mean pretty good it's just oh shit he didn't go away

1614
05:01:20,259 --> 05:01:55,189
he's still there let's go ah damn it unfortunate any good food in here what would it be under

1615
05:01:55,750 --> 05:02:03,900
we're like the burgers somebody has like a burger right the cook is to the right i want just like

1616
05:02:03,900 --> 05:02:11,689
the meatiest food yeah i think we would beat it if we actually potioned i mean i i like panic

1617
05:02:11,689 --> 05:02:22,459
potions but it wasn't very good um cook i don't see a cook he's outside of our base in a random

1618
05:02:22,459 --> 05:02:32,099
house why is he down here i don't know some people just end up out there all right let's see

1619
05:02:34,419 --> 05:02:54,020
steamed carrots full for 45 seconds increase knockback increase magic damage movement speed

1620
05:02:55,159 --> 05:03:15,619
life regen here we go apple pie so when i want um juice head off dude you want to try that again

1621
05:03:16,580 --> 05:03:23,220
yeah i need to make another something this time i think i'm gonna go with the other um

1622
05:03:23,220 --> 05:03:33,380
summon for this i forgot how i made it that's the problem is that they're on the ground

1623
05:03:34,500 --> 05:03:46,330
and a lot of the best like hardest bosses are flying around yeah the ice claspers definitely

1624
05:03:46,330 --> 05:04:05,990
better for this i have to de-summon you guys okay i have my ice claspers they should be much better

1625
05:04:06,950 --> 05:04:16,659
uh am i blind i should have it what is this altar that's over here i'm gonna use this as well

1626
05:04:16,659 --> 05:04:20,180
it feels like it's better than aiming with this because it flies around so fast

1627
05:04:21,060 --> 05:04:32,900
are we just going back to where we were yeah i'm trying to figure out oh i need lead bars that's

1628
05:04:32,900 --> 05:04:50,439
kind of random oh no i have them i run to a tree stop what would i give terraria out of 10 obsidian

1629
05:04:51,770 --> 05:05:07,430
um i don't know a four i'm getting generous all right that went too far i have no obsidian

1630
05:05:08,069 --> 05:05:22,580
no and we have none um i don't like it eight and a half seven eight point four eight point eight

1631
05:05:22,580 --> 05:05:39,819
eight point four maybe eight point four i'm sticking with that one right now eight point

1632
05:05:39,819 --> 05:06:00,060
four omega lull what that's pretty that's good all right what would you give it you are like

1633
05:06:00,060 --> 05:06:14,069
mr terraria what would you give terraria um 10 that's a lie no it's not you're not going to give

1634
05:06:14,069 --> 05:06:21,610
this game 10 i know that's perfect why wouldn't i give this game a 10 because i i know that you're

1635
05:06:21,689 --> 05:06:24,729
just being like facetious i'm not

1636
05:06:30,659 --> 05:06:38,259
what is a better craft them up game that terraria doesn't deserve the 10 because it's the best one

1637
05:06:38,259 --> 05:06:43,060
yeah but you take you to 10 for a certain category or i'm talking like overall like how you feel

1638
05:06:43,060 --> 05:06:48,259
about the game not just just because this is a better crafting game than day z doesn't mean

1639
05:06:48,259 --> 05:06:53,540
that it's in every single other one i think that's enough to be like you know what something has to

1640
05:06:53,540 --> 05:07:02,150
define what a 10 is and i think terraria sets the bar in my opinion for the type of game that i like

1641
05:07:02,150 --> 05:07:10,790
what's a game that's six out of ten days gone i'm sorry i'm sorry you're disappointed that i like

1642
05:07:10,790 --> 05:07:22,939
things i really let you down days gone might be like a five eight what's a better craft them up

1643
05:07:24,060 --> 05:07:24,380
uh

1644
05:07:42,889 --> 05:07:52,229
are you over there i'm just trying to think something star forge no

1645
05:07:55,590 --> 05:08:01,270
you're fucking kidding me well i mean i didn't go that i didn't like it just go that far but

1646
05:08:01,270 --> 05:08:16,200
i tore this is i played star forge for like an hour um i don't know i guess there's not i guess

1647
05:08:16,200 --> 05:08:25,060
there isn't like a better crafting adventure fighter kind of i mean minecraft do you see what

1648
05:08:25,060 --> 05:08:30,099
this is doing yes what it's doing it's going to do that all the time and it's not giving me any

1649
05:08:30,099 --> 05:08:39,000
shield it's just going to annoy you it's like putting zeros over my head i thought those are

1650
05:08:39,000 --> 05:08:48,900
bubbles okay so uh don't use that thing oh wait i needed obsidian that's why i was down there dude

1651
05:08:48,900 --> 05:08:55,720
i got so distracted by that toria question and i found the mushroom biome i mean i do it yeah

1652
05:08:56,680 --> 05:09:04,569
okay overall i think it's like somewhere in the eights but i guess it is like probably like the

1653
05:09:04,569 --> 05:09:09,770
best or one of the better crafting fighting so here's the question because you're doing right

1654
05:09:09,770 --> 05:09:14,889
now what you're doing is the game of the year is an eight out of ten rather than being a ten what

1655
05:09:14,889 --> 05:09:21,799
what would have to happen for the best game of its genre to become a ten well that's a it's

1656
05:09:21,799 --> 05:09:26,599
a very personal question because like what i think is a ten overall you might not think is a ten

1657
05:09:26,599 --> 05:09:35,189
overall well yeah i'm asking you what you think the game is missing uh i don't think it's missing

1658
05:09:35,189 --> 05:09:41,990
anything i think it needs to have things taken away like what i think it's a little too chaotic

1659
05:09:42,790 --> 05:09:50,889
well also remember this is with mods so if you did want what's chaotic oh right well i can't give

1660
05:09:50,889 --> 05:10:00,569
you a real opinion then my opinion is is completely invalid because i i'm playing not i'm not playing

1661
05:10:00,569 --> 05:10:05,130
the real true version of the game you see guys you could learn a lot from germa this is how you

1662
05:10:05,130 --> 05:10:10,330
successfully with an audience manage to not have an opinion about something and upset nobody it's

1663
05:10:10,330 --> 05:10:18,419
very a delicate walk you have to do but he's very talented at it it's hard to say i'm very

1664
05:10:18,419 --> 05:10:28,139
talented what how is that a delicate what i said the game is like an 8.4 that's a very good score

1665
05:10:29,180 --> 05:10:37,139
that what i think the game is over a seven which is like wow a seven is still a fun game

1666
05:10:37,139 --> 05:10:45,779
game i would play a seven i've played plenty of sevens before so have you yeah i'm not

1667
05:10:45,779 --> 05:10:51,209
disagreeing that that an 8.4 is just wondering what the points were being taken off for

1668
05:10:55,270 --> 05:11:02,869
realistically it is probably just how chaotic it can get but then you came in with that little

1669
05:11:02,869 --> 05:11:09,349
rebuttal saying you're playing on mods sir that's why so it's like okay well it's maybe

1670
05:11:09,349 --> 05:11:24,619
it would i guess it would be higher i don't know okay what's a six out of ten for you what is a

1671
05:11:24,619 --> 05:11:32,540
six a ten a six yeah like days gone is was like a of the highest five maybe six maybe that's like

1672
05:11:32,540 --> 05:11:39,180
a six out of ten game well let me let me look at like installed or games yeah that's hard to

1673
05:11:39,180 --> 05:11:53,110
remember like all the remade list of sixes uh sakiro get mad um why do you think i'm gonna

1674
05:11:53,110 --> 05:12:05,610
get mad someone in your chat and someone in my i mean i didn't like sakiro as much as i liked

1675
05:12:05,610 --> 05:12:10,250
bloodborne i thought sakiro was a way way way worse game than bloodborne

1676
05:12:14,900 --> 05:12:21,540
i don't know if i would give sakiro a six get mad i'm not i'm mad i'm not mad at all i'm

1677
05:12:21,540 --> 05:12:29,849
teleporting to you i'm not i'm very calm about this whole conversation okay i am potioning up

1678
05:12:29,849 --> 05:12:39,770
yes so am i i am putting things down i'm ready ready as we can be i guess

1679
05:12:40,569 --> 05:12:50,330
okay i got baited by my own guys they went and attacked something over there

1680
05:12:53,939 --> 05:12:59,099
try to not stand near each other if we're getting hit with the same charges

1681
05:13:01,099 --> 05:13:08,459
oh did he really just wait to do it over there oh my god he's just hit me every time

1682
05:13:09,259 --> 05:13:13,580
he's obnoxious teleport to town if you need to to heal the nurse and teleport on me with

1683
05:13:13,580 --> 05:13:16,860
the i'm

1684
05:13:20,060 --> 05:13:23,500
i'm just gonna live so you can come back i have to put that on a hot key

1685
05:13:32,500 --> 05:13:45,459
his hitbox is so big okay i'm coming are you good yeah come quick

1686
05:13:52,409 --> 05:13:53,930

1687
05:14:02,299 --> 05:14:10,970
okay i'm gonna die soon or what

1688
05:14:19,979 --> 05:14:31,240
he's dead oh what did he drop good me i didn't get any oh it's all here

1689
05:14:35,659 --> 05:14:45,159
oh yeah yeah yeah maybe if you weren't so zoomed in you could see the boss better

1690
05:14:47,110 --> 05:14:53,430
the hive 106 range damage launches a variety of rockets that explode into beads

1691
05:14:54,389 --> 05:15:00,229
the worst life regen getting rid of that out of here i think that's all i got

1692
05:15:06,939 --> 05:15:21,740
the hive is a legendary weapon i don't know what ammo it takes probably we can do the eclipse now

1693
05:15:33,700 --> 05:15:57,939
i guess rocket did i go too far blood bloodborne is like a nine nine nine eight nine no

1694
05:15:58,500 --> 05:16:09,779
it's a 9.85 yeah i think so what why can't it be a 10 why is everyone so stingy with the 10s

1695
05:16:09,779 --> 05:16:16,310
because it's 30 fps and they didn't decide for any reason to like upgrade or deported or

1696
05:16:16,310 --> 05:16:24,340
you know put it anywhere else that's a good point it's an attractive well thought out point

1697
05:16:24,340 --> 05:16:32,709
it's really the only thing i'm a very smart guy even on the ps4 pro the summoning alter

1698
05:16:35,000 --> 05:16:42,139
what's a 10 out of 10 game ocarina of time super mario 3d world i mean brothers i mean

1723
05:21:45,979 --> 05:22:04,279
crafting okay he's entitled to that opinion can i give you another unpopular opinion what is this

1724
05:22:04,279 --> 05:22:10,119
like unpopular video game opinions i i think elder scrolls games are not good is that like bad

1725
05:22:11,080 --> 05:22:21,900
um i mean you're wrong and i might i don't know i just i they feel like i don't know

1726
05:22:23,340 --> 05:22:27,580
oblivion was all right i liked oblivion for a little while but like i feel like skyrim just

1727
05:22:27,580 --> 05:22:35,349
didn't just didn't do anything for me at all it's because you're a mod list fuck no no you're not a

1728
05:22:35,349 --> 05:22:42,229
modless fuck modless you deny it no no i um i did a bunch of mods okay were they nude mods

1729
05:22:43,029 --> 05:22:51,369
this is a safe space no they were not nudity mods okay

1730
05:23:03,180 --> 05:23:14,650
he hesitated no listen fallout also is not very good i think bethesda did bethesda seriously just

1731
05:23:14,650 --> 05:23:22,619
like somehow hypnotize everybody to think that they make a good games they make this is this is

1732
05:23:22,619 --> 05:23:28,299
unpopular opinion night it is i'm sorry they make a specific type of game that no one else makes

1733
05:23:28,860 --> 05:23:32,860
fallout new vegas was good it was fun it was interesting it was really entertaining

1734
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:38,540
right but like fallout 4 i thought was not very good at all fallout 3 was kind of a buggy broken

1735
05:23:38,540 --> 05:23:42,619
mess and all the games were like that too like fallout new vegas was good i really liked fallout

1736
05:23:42,619 --> 05:23:55,799
new vegas oblivion was fun you're asking you say unpopular video game opinions and then you say new

1737
05:23:55,799 --> 05:24:02,180
is the best fallout i'm gonna hit you with fallout 4 was better no no it was not it was not absolutely

1738
05:24:02,180 --> 05:24:08,020
not yeah it was fallout 4 was not better than fallout new vegas no way fallout new vegas was

1739
05:24:08,020 --> 05:24:14,500
a cheap reskin of fallout 4 that used things modders had already made for fallout 4 to make

1740
05:24:14,500 --> 05:24:20,580
new vegas like survival mode that was introduced in vegas was just a mod for fallout 4 i don't

1741
05:24:20,580 --> 05:24:27,689
believe this at all how do you not believe it that those are facts fallout 4 was a action game

1742
05:24:27,689 --> 05:24:32,650
they had a protagonist that just talked and there was no such thing as interesting stuff

1743
05:24:32,650 --> 05:24:37,849
there's no factions no wait wait it was an action game there was a protagonist who talked

1744
05:24:37,849 --> 05:24:42,009
yeah that was that was the worst part about it it wasn't me anymore it was the guy that sounds

1745
05:24:42,009 --> 05:24:45,450
like chris pratt was that it was chris pratt that was the actor that did it apparently

1746
05:24:48,630 --> 05:24:52,709
no there was no like no no no like fun things to crazy things interesting things to do in fallout

1747
05:24:52,709 --> 05:24:55,590
4 is an action game chris pratt is the main character

1748
05:25:03,750 --> 05:25:07,349
fallout 4 is an action that's i i don't i don't consider fallout 4 to be like a

1749
05:25:08,310 --> 05:25:21,590
true full rpg like fallout new vegas what it's a fun yeah it's a fun action game but it's not

1750
05:25:21,590 --> 05:25:25,830
i it's not what i wanted from like my fallout game and it was based in the city of boston

1751
05:25:25,830 --> 05:25:30,069
and we're talking about that's like my favorite place so that gets like two full letter grades

1752
05:25:30,069 --> 05:25:35,189
from me but then i moved to vegas therefore those two letter grades then transition over to vegas

1753
05:25:35,189 --> 05:25:41,849
i was mixing out i was i meant fallout 3 fallout 3 is better than new vegas and new vegas did we

1754
05:25:41,849 --> 05:25:47,290
really just have a full fucking argument and you were in the wrong game yeah i was saying fall they

1755
05:25:47,290 --> 05:25:52,250
made fallout 3 fallout 3 is a better game than new vegas new vegas just introduced all the new

1756
05:25:52,250 --> 05:25:58,970
mechanics in new vegas were just mods like ripped from fallout 4 and from fallout 3 you are arguing

1757
05:25:58,970 --> 05:26:03,930
for the wrong game but i will still say fallout 4 is better than both of them

1758
05:26:04,889 --> 05:26:11,369
what that makes it what do you wait wait wait what hold on a fallout 3 is better than new vegas

1759
05:26:11,369 --> 05:26:19,689
and fallout 4 is the best all right you better be careful someone right now is making like an

1760
05:26:19,689 --> 05:26:26,650
incantation like spell you're gonna get cursed we did fallout 4 streams and people liked them

1761
05:26:26,650 --> 05:26:30,409
and i said you know i'm gonna do new vegas next and i installed new vegas i installed mods and

1762
05:26:30,409 --> 05:26:35,610
i opened it and i was testing it to make sure it worked and that game is fucking garby wait which

1763
05:26:35,610 --> 05:26:44,419
one new vegas you don't like new vegas at all like at all no no really i think the story is better

1764
05:26:45,380 --> 05:26:48,520
but barely and who cares

1765
05:26:50,759 --> 05:26:59,720
uh i i thought new vegas was like very fun and charming he's doing this on purpose

1766
05:27:00,439 --> 05:27:06,919
i'm not that's the thing though unpopular opinion i actually have these opinions that are so wrong

1767
05:27:06,919 --> 05:27:14,200
and there's nothing you can do about it oh my god well i mean i do think that i don't really

1768
05:27:14,840 --> 05:27:19,240
let's put it this way i would not put any of the last 10 to 15 year bethesda games

1769
05:27:19,799 --> 05:27:23,319
in like a top 10 list of best games i've ever played i just don't think i would

1770
05:27:25,349 --> 05:27:29,590
i did enjoy them some of them but i i thought some of them were also pretty not good either

1771
05:27:30,790 --> 05:27:39,180
well i wouldn't put fallout new vegas in like my top five best games top 10 best games i enjoyed

1772
05:27:39,180 --> 05:27:48,540
a couple of their bethesda games and that's all right that's completely fine name the top 10

1773
05:27:48,540 --> 05:27:57,700
super mario rpg diablo 2 the neverhood no sorry let me get that right bloodborne mario rpg

1774
05:27:59,669 --> 05:28:05,750
card crawl um oh my god i'm just kidding oh no i was saying i was saying oh my god

1775
05:28:05,750 --> 05:28:14,500
because the bow i've been using is awful like the modifier on it is awful i didn't quite catch that

1776
05:28:15,299 --> 05:28:27,130
sorcery yeah there you go so what are we are we good to try something else now or what are you

1777
05:28:27,130 --> 05:28:31,529
doing you never got the thing you needed so we're gonna need to do another fuck that's right during

1778
05:28:31,529 --> 05:28:45,610
dating do you have it you you've been team fortress yep chrono trigger oh wait what's the current

1779
05:28:45,610 --> 05:28:49,849
question i was reading what's like your top 10 like favorite games it's the best top 10

1780
05:28:49,849 --> 05:28:57,430
right yeah bloodborne's on there for me yes right see it is a very good game

1781
05:29:00,659 --> 05:29:08,299
so what was okay what was your big problem with hero um it was just it was way too like over the

1782
05:29:08,299 --> 05:29:14,860
top like heart every change that they made to the dark souls formula to make it new was bad

1783
05:29:15,659 --> 05:29:23,130
it was just flat out bad oh um i thought you're gonna say it was a rhythm game no

1784
05:29:24,360 --> 05:29:37,270
because it was is that your thing no i i'm one of those weirdos that equally hated and equally

1785
05:29:37,270 --> 05:29:42,520
loved sakira at the same time it's so polarizing in my brain remembering how much i loved certain

1786
05:29:42,520 --> 05:29:56,020
areas and how much i hated certain other things i wouldn't put secure at a six though that's just

1787
05:29:56,020 --> 05:30:08,250
like whoa that's a little too far so how many attempts did you do with the last boss before

1788
05:30:08,250 --> 05:30:15,540
you said i don't want to do this ever again i'm curious i gave up before then so for them

1789
05:30:16,500 --> 05:30:24,040
yeah at the boss before the last boss i i think i i did everything up until the final boss and

1790
05:30:24,040 --> 05:30:28,840
had already seen the final boss on like speedrun streams and didn't have the desire to do it

1791
05:30:31,419 --> 05:30:38,220
okay i did play it for a while on one stream but that that one that doesn't count is sakira

1792
05:30:38,220 --> 05:30:45,939
is sakira worse than dark souls 3 uh no dark souls 3 is second place after bloodborne if

1793
05:30:45,939 --> 05:30:52,389
you're counting bloodborne as a souls born game okay so you think so you got you do bloodborne

1794
05:30:52,389 --> 05:31:00,009
dark souls 3 is like your top two and then dark souls 2 dark souls 2 is you think dark souls 2

1795
05:31:00,009 --> 05:31:07,430
is better than dark souls 1 yeah did you play demon souls no it is your problem you have to

1796
05:31:07,430 --> 05:31:16,419
play demon souls bloodborne is number one demon souls number two dark souls one is number three

1797
05:31:16,419 --> 05:31:23,580
three dark souls uh then probably dark souls three sakira dark souls two for me

1798
05:31:24,459 --> 05:31:29,099
sakira way bottom throw it in the trash a bargain bin

1799
05:31:33,900 --> 05:31:36,619
all right come on we the reason why we're sitting around is because we have to wait

1800
05:31:36,619 --> 05:31:41,259
till the next morning yeah we can't do eclipse until morning and i'm just like going through

1801
05:31:41,259 --> 05:31:47,020
recipes and stuff uh there are items that let you skip the morning and stuff like that

1802
05:31:47,979 --> 05:31:52,459
but i don't it's almost i don't or i'm having a nice time talking to my boy

1803
05:31:53,419 --> 05:31:57,819
you would really like demon souls if you liked bloodborne it follows a lot of the same weird

1804
05:31:57,819 --> 05:32:03,180
principles that bloodborne did especially like the hub world stuff i've seen quite a bit of it

1805
05:32:04,459 --> 05:32:10,939
i'm absolutely shocked that they have not done even a like a remake just not even a remake just

1806
05:32:10,939 --> 05:32:16,139
a remaster just ported to oh yeah yeah ps4 with a higher resolution and up to frame rate i don't

1807
05:32:16,220 --> 05:32:23,270
why would they not do that i don't i don't think i'll play it unless they do and even then i've

1808
05:32:23,270 --> 05:32:29,189
seen enough of it and i'm kind of burnt on like too many souls games as is yeah oh dude what about

1809
05:32:29,189 --> 05:32:39,209
elden rain i'll play it look from software has that formula where they do something so interesting

1810
05:32:39,849 --> 05:32:44,490
that they're all worth playing because it's something you know that formula you know it's

1811
05:32:44,490 --> 05:32:48,889
going to at least somewhat follow that really interesting unique formula so it don't matter

1812
05:32:48,889 --> 05:32:57,639
they're all going to be worth trying or at least worth playing ah shit i do need truffle

1813
05:32:58,599 --> 05:33:02,520

05:40:04,540 --> 05:40:08,299
uh no i'm bow guy yeah are you sure you don't want to be melee guy if there was a thing that

1857
05:40:08,299 --> 05:40:14,540
was like 150 space yeah yeah i'm sure my last playthrough i was melee guy i don't want to do

1858
05:40:14,540 --> 05:40:28,650
it again okay yeah you don't want me to get my main in here do you i guess not uh when is uh when

1859
05:40:28,650 --> 05:40:35,500

1860
05:40:35,500 --> 05:40:50,279

1862
05:41:17,619 --> 05:41:22,099
i really hope we get one more monthron if we get one more monthron it might work

1863
05:41:23,060 --> 05:41:32,340
we should because we did it early the warp staff outdated i think it kind of is but it's

1864
05:41:32,340 --> 05:41:35,939
just free to use it's not like it's taking up any extra space or anything

1865
05:41:37,700 --> 05:42:03,180
like it's half two centuries so um you gotta be kidding me there's 27 gold in the ground right at

1874
05:43:45,080 --> 05:43:55,659
how much damage are your ice claspers they're uh 57 58 and how many do you have like seven

1876
05:44:07,430 --> 05:44:14,099

05:44:14,099 --> 05:44:20,259
like a fucking bread cut through the middle of it so they can get in we have just an open this

1980
06:05:56,500 --> 06:06:03,450

1981
06:06:03,450 --> 06:06:15,900
out no i don't want to fight i don't want to be overstimulated i need to we need to like

1982
06:06:22,950 --> 06:06:52,580
um i'm going back to the bunker yeah we have to exploit the human's weakness the boredom for

1983
06:06:52,580 --> 06:07:06,950
killing us the only way this keeps sending thousands of people their wrists will start

1984
06:07:07,430 --> 06:07:09,509
and that's when we strike with the real weapon

1985
06:07:27,610 --> 06:07:31,080
icebreaker

1986
06:07:33,240 --> 06:08:09,180
i like body itches am i like allergic to this welcome to the meat grinder i i hate the dashes

1987
06:08:09,180 --> 06:08:22,470
in this game there's two senses of there needs to be a dash button too much noise these sounds

1988
06:08:24,790 --> 06:08:28,790
this is actually kind of is fucking with me i'm not gonna lie this is fucking with my head

1989
06:08:32,740 --> 06:08:37,220
i'm doing a few hard blinks you know that's when it gets to the point where you hold on a minute

1990
06:08:37,220 --> 06:09:05,049
we got to slow down i'm going in all right uh where's this last uh it's done there's a meter

1991
06:09:05,049 --> 06:09:23,259
at the bottom right deflects enemy projectiles snowstorm staff fire the snowflake that follows

1992
06:09:23,259 --> 06:09:39,049
the mouse cursor 63 to 60 let's check that out glacial crusher icebreaker laser drill

1993
06:09:42,810 --> 06:09:50,200
oh that's the thing you've been using

1994
06:09:57,939 --> 06:10:04,540
so this does not use mana i can just keep doing no yeah it it uses the thing that appears above

1995
06:10:04,540 --> 06:10:12,169
your head which is bard inspiration no i'm talking about this snowflake i guess it just

1996
06:10:12,169 --> 06:10:40,200
breaks when it hits something oh is that a melee weapon no magic all right star think all right

1997
06:10:40,200 --> 06:10:43,799
think i'm gonna try i think it's time to transition to the other stuff that i was gonna do

1998
06:10:44,520 --> 06:10:52,069
okay i've been sick almost six and a half hours okay i forgive you how close are we to

1999
06:10:54,759 --> 06:10:58,680
uh i'll be very very clear and completely and totally open about this

2000
06:10:59,319 --> 06:11:04,040
that last encounter um just like i need a break

2001
06:11:05,880 --> 06:11:10,119
yeah i understand you've said that a couple times i'm understanding what you're where you're coming

2002
06:11:10,119 --> 06:11:19,689
from i feel like i just got off uh a ride at the carnival you know the ones that like turn you

2003
06:11:19,689 --> 06:11:29,209
upside down i've never been upside down before so now i don't i don't there was this riot called um

2004
06:11:29,209 --> 06:11:35,979
this is right called the zipper you ever ride that the zip now it's this weird it's this

2005
06:11:35,979 --> 06:11:44,939
like 12 of these enclosed uh canisters and they they go on a belt up around in a circle and they

2006
06:11:44,939 --> 06:11:50,220
are independently can move completely in a circle as well so what happens is you it's a room for

2007
06:11:50,220 --> 06:11:55,500
two people in there this thing is on its own independent axis and it's going upside down

2008
06:11:55,580 --> 06:12:04,200
yes we could do this together so that ride sucks so much and has always caused a problem for people

2009
06:12:04,200 --> 06:12:09,959
because at least three or four times a night they have to spray down three or four of those

2010
06:12:09,959 --> 06:12:18,389
cans because somebody puked in it so yeah i feel like i just got off the zipper i really do would

2011
06:12:18,389 --> 06:12:25,930
you like to get back on the zipper we can do it again next week next week you're gonna do the

2012
06:12:25,930 --> 06:12:35,560
zipper uh yeah that's what you you you want to play this sooner than that uh no no no that

2013
06:12:35,560 --> 06:12:39,720
sounds good can you stop shutting this door it's i don't want to why i don't know close doors

2014
06:12:41,540 --> 06:12:52,939
i hate this door i hate this door but yeah um uh this is fun how far are we to getting close to

2015
06:12:52,939 --> 06:12:57,979
the end of the game okay so what happens is you know those things you shouldn't have killed the

2016
06:12:57,979 --> 06:13:03,340
cultist you kill the cultist guy it summons four pillars around the map which are kind of like

2017
06:13:05,479 --> 06:13:09,720
you kill waves of enemies then you can destroy the pillar you have to destroy all four and then

2018
06:13:09,720 --> 06:13:16,630
after you destroy all four the moon lord appears and he's the final boss cool plus all of the other

2019
06:13:16,630 --> 06:13:22,939
bosses that are modded but that's the core game okay so we think we'll be able to get to the end

2020
06:13:22,939 --> 06:13:27,419
of the base game in like the next couple streams maybe two three streams uh the next stream will

2021
06:13:27,419 --> 06:13:33,979
definitely be moon lord i would expect unless we just kind of delay it oh well then we could just

2022
06:13:33,979 --> 06:13:40,549
i don't know i i'm still having fun time yeah like the the stuff immediately after moon lord

2023
06:13:40,549 --> 06:13:44,869
is a lot of fun because that's when you your items start to get ridiculous like moon lord

2024
06:13:45,509 --> 06:13:51,240
even gives you a portal gun which is fun to goof around with so now i realize what you meant really

2025
06:13:51,240 --> 06:13:54,919
wild when you were saying that so now i know what you meant by you kind of have to just pick

2026
06:13:54,919 --> 06:14:03,770
something you want oh melee summoning magic ranged rifles yeah there's so many fucking things in

2027
06:14:03,770 --> 06:14:07,450
this game that you just have you do have to just pick something well by this point you've

2028
06:14:07,450 --> 06:14:12,169
you've also specialized every accessory and equipment choice to be like oh i'm the summon

2029
06:14:12,169 --> 06:14:15,849
guy and if you're like oh i want to switch to melee every accessory has to come off and you need

2030
06:14:15,849 --> 06:14:28,869
to like combine into a million yeah all right well that was fun yeah enjoy the rest of your night

2031
06:14:29,830 --> 06:14:34,470
everybody over in star's side and if everybody people are leaving because they wanted to see

2032
06:14:34,470 --> 06:14:42,939
terraria then we'll see you later moving on to dos for a few hours well we'll see i'm just gonna

2033
06:14:42,939 --> 06:14:50,060
play for like 10 15 minutes like finish this stupid mushroom buy room and stuff okay well

2034
06:14:50,060 --> 06:15:03,290
everyone say bye to star say bye star bye go away

2035
06:15:03,290 --> 06:15:47,380
i can't do it i can't i can't bring myself to do it i can't bring myself to do it because he's like

2036
06:15:47,380 --> 06:15:52,419
not even over here right now and if the whole house was gone when he came back and he wouldn't

2037
06:15:52,419 --> 06:15:56,659
even know and it would be fucking terrible plus when i would have to like beat the game no i'm

2038
06:15:56,659 --> 06:16:02,500
not gonna do that i can't do that like i still have to live here over the next couple of weeks

2039
06:16:02,500 --> 06:16:10,470
i know no that's too far from me i'm not doing it all right let's switch to dos let me go i'm

2040
06:16:10,470 --> 06:16:19,939
gonna go grab the water i'll be right back i'm still here i'm just over there can i like scare

2041
06:16:19,939 --> 06:16:42,700
them no i'm gonna get lost trying to do that i'm just leaving i said i was moving on to dos so

2042
06:16:42,700 --> 06:16:53,060
that's what we're gonna do but that was fun i'll be right back i'm gonna grab a drink just some

2043
06:16:53,060 --> 06:16:57,779
water and i'll come back and we'll do some dos i already have a few queued up that i think might

2044
06:16:57,779 --> 06:17:02,979
be interesting i'm gonna leave the squad stream by the way because why would i still be doing a

2045
06:17:02,979 --> 06:17:20,139
squad stream change the title to games and demos he's bragging about how he could beat you in pvp

2046
06:17:21,110 --> 06:17:26,709
yeah i feel like the terraria pvp is the same thing as diablo 2 pvp where you'd have a sorceress

2047
06:17:26,709 --> 06:17:31,509
with thunderstorm and decked out with like plus 40 skills and when you walked out of the rogue

2048
06:17:31,509 --> 06:17:35,509
encampment you instantly died from the lightning bolt so that's fine it's probably not as it's

2049
06:17:35,509 --> 06:17:43,830
probably pretty imbalanced i'll be right back see you in like two minutes
