1
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:26,309
Hey, I was checking on you. How are you? How are you? Good to see you.

2
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:37,899
I'm dry. My hair's a little wet. In the shower. I had to take a shower and I just didn't.

3
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:49,049
Oh, I'm clean now. Clean Andy. Prove it. You got to prove it.

4
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,740
Okay. I'll prove it. In a minute. Did you get stuck in the drain?

5
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,290
Obviously not because I'm here. I did actually. My toe got stuck.

6
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,620
He's lying. I'm not lying. You'll see my wet hair in a second. I'm not doing face cam today.

7
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:27,510
Maybe I will. I got a coffee too. We can go over a few things today. Let me tweet this. I'll be

8
00:01:27,510 --> 00:03:21,770
right back. All right. I didn't tweet yet. I have to send a message. Let me send a message. Okay.

9
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:33,479
A rank today. That's exactly what we're doing. I'm going to try to get to A rank with Cosmic

10
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,699
Calamity. If you don't know who Cosmic Calamity is. I've been living under a rock.

11
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:47,849
Biggest superstar in the monster fighting leagues. Okay. Let me just put my Twitch here.

12
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:08,659
Yeah. I had to take a shower. I was feeling very icky. Okay. All right. I'm ready. No more stalling.

13
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:16,379
How are you? Let's move over here. Maybe I'll stall for a little bit. Just a minute here because

14
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,180
I have to explain a few things. So this week, we got some interesting things to do.

15
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,829
If you missed the stream from a couple days ago, I would suggest you go watch it. It was a fun time.

16
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:35,029
I was on Ms. Kiff's stream doing parasocial. It was a good time. That was Monday. Today we're

17
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:38,870
going to do Monster Rancher 2. And then from Monster Rancher 2, we're going to go to Monster

18
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:49,959
Rancher 2 and hopefully beat this game real soon. Hoping to. Like I told you, I'm not going to stop

19
00:04:49,959 --> 00:05:02,180
streaming this game until we at least get to S rank with somebody. After this stream, we're going

20
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:09,060
to get the You Laugh, You Lose stuff ready and the Baby Sensory stuff because that's where we're

21
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:18,569
going to take an entire stream. So that will be Tuesday the 21st. I have to come up with some

22
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:26,060
incentives. I don't want it to be like, oh, if I laugh, I lost. I think this should be some

23
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,699
interesting incentive. Yeah. What do we get if you laugh? Exactly what I'm saying. Well, you just

24
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:42,379
lose. Well, yeah, you just lose. But I want it to be something to do. You give subs. Yeah, that's

25
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:50,250
I could do that. I think there's other ones too that could be fun. Okay. I saw you said ice that

26
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,300
motherfucker. You're talking about this. Talking about this character. What I thought you were

27
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:13,589
saying is pour ice down your pants. If I laugh, that's a good do that possible. You laugh,

28
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:23,290
you pour ice down your pants. I fucking spilled already in even 10 minutes. God damn it.

29
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,439
This is why I have an AI. This is why I just have to only use Amazon Basics keyboards

30
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:37,000
only. They're never I can never have anything remotely valuable underneath me in this room.

31
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,529
Ever. You know, you see those streamer setups that they look amazing. There's all those cool

32
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:50,649
swirling lights and there's awesome pristine keyboards and they've got so much cool shit.

33
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:55,290
They have so much wire control. No, I will break that stuff. I will ruin it.

34
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:02,790
Coffee is underneath the space bar now and I can't get it. I need a paper towel. Hold on.

35
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:36,310
Give me one second. All right. Hello. You do that thing where you bunch up a piece of toilet paper

36
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:44,470
or paper towel and you slide it under. I'm picking a lock. You have to slide it long ways

37
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,819
underneath the keys and like tilt it around. I'll break it if I pop it off.

38
00:07:51,459 --> 00:08:03,980
Will I break it? Let me see. Have you voted in the awards? I mean, the voting is not open yet.

39
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,019
Hopefully that's not a problem. I just pulled the space bar off. Is that a problem?

40
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,120
Oh no. All right. I can get under here though. Oh, what the what else is under here?

41
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:24,730
I feel like I just lifted up the couch. Oh, oh, that's what it looks like under there.

42
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:36,970
Cover it back up. All right. Let's go. Shit. I didn't put it on right. I put it on upside down.

43
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:43,110
I don't care. I don't care. I'll fix it later. All right. Let's do it. Welcome back, everybody.

44
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,299
We're doing vigorous training. You want to just prove that? Okay, I'll prove it.

45
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:58,759
Okay. There you go. See? Prove that I was just in the shower. There it is.

46
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:08,409
No more face cam. Not today. You're looking, you're looking nice and slick. Hey, nice.

47
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:19,029
Oh, yeah. The you laugh, you lose stuff. I've never done it before. I can't believe I've gone

48
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:29,350
10 plus years across YouTube and Twitch and I've never done it. I have no idea what's going to

49
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,789
happen. Why have I not? I don't know. I just haven't. There's never was, there's never reason

50
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:43,049
for me to do it. It's because it's lazy content. I think it's fun. Look, something can be lazy

51
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:52,100
content and be really fun to do. It's all right. All right. So what does the schedule look like?

52
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,570
First of all, hey, welcome again. Thanks for coming by the stream. Let's go. Put the cam back on.

53
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,799
All right. I'll put the cam back on for, there is something else I want to address that I thought

54
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,600
was hilarious, but I want to wait till a lot of people are here because it's one of the funniest

55
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,330
fucking things I've seen in like at least a month. So we need to wait. I want to wait till everyone

56
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:24,570
gets here. All right. Last thing I did is I beat C rank. So we're going to take this guy, do some

57
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:37,320
training. Wait, what is the actual, let me see the data. 621 intelligence. 8K is not enough.

58
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,710
8K isn't enough. Well, I'm not saying it's not enough. I'm just saying it has to wait. Give me

59
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:52,549
like 30 or 40 minutes so everyone that wants to be here is here. So I want to get to like probably

60
00:10:52,549 --> 00:11:00,870
700 intelligence and like three or 400 skill. The only way this thing is ever going to be worth

61
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,059
using is just by being a glass cannon. That's it. So we're doing the same thing we did before.

62
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:15,529
Get them in there. Start with the, not power. Intelligence and skill. Meditate. Go for it.

63
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:23,639
This is the worst monster in the game, Jeremy. You need to let it go. I think I can get this guy to A

64
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:46,039
rank. I really do. Needs more life. All right. You see him well. How am I still soft? B. All right.

65
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:56,360
When's the actual official B tournament? Right here. All right. I got a little while. I got some time.

66
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,379
Okay. You guys ready? Are you guys ready to hear like one of the funniest things I've fucking seen

67
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:10,059
all week? So somebody in the discord had a little bit of a problem. Just a small problem. And they

68
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:20,059
brought it to the discord's attention. And I, my stomach hurt from laughing at this picture. So

69
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,669
why don't we take a look and see what happened? So this is what they posted.

70
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:34,299
I'm actually going to turn the game capture off for a second. So, uh,

71
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:42,019
jazzy ball has a little story for us and it goes something like this. So I'm home for the holidays

72
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,740
from college and I decided to watch some germ of vids on my parents' big TV because I was bored.

73
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,299
Okay. We've established what's going on. So I microwave some pizza and turn it onto this

74
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:01,240
compilation of edits of Jerma's faces. When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.

75
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,389
So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off. And it's stuck

76
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,649
on this fucked up image of Jerma's face. Okay. I don't know how that happened. A couple hours

77
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:20,570
pass and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decided to unplug the TV. And then I

78
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,070
realized that the face is permanently burned onto the screen. Like it's just stuck there.

79
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:32,950
My parents aren't back until later in the night. So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen

80
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:44,649
so that they don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV. What do I do?

81
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:58,950
I don't even understand. Green burn-in? How long does screen burn-in last? People are saying fake,

82
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:07,820
but I mean, it looks kind of real. The screen burn-ins for OLEDs can be permanent.

83
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:25,460
No, it's not. Okay. That's insane if it is. It's fucked up forever. So what do you do?

84
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:34,549
OLED, it can be permanent. Okay. Well, here's what we need. This is very important. 24 hours from now,

85
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:39,659
I need an update or even now, like even like a like six to 12, you know, hours from now.

86
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:50,070
I want to see the improvement. Imagine coming home and this is what you see on the TV.

87
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,389
But you were asking, how do you, what do you do about this? I don't know. You can't just

88
00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:01,129
throw a blanket on this. I mean, why is there a blanket on the TV? What are you going to have

89
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:10,870
to just come clean and say, I don't know what happened. I left this face on here, pay them back,

90
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:21,289
replace the TV. It's your fault. You need to replace the TV. I didn't do anything. It's my

91
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:33,940
fault. You have to replace it. I didn't sell the TV to this person. You, you psycho. You destroyed

92
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,759
somebody's TV. So that's what, okay. According to what they said, this is what it looks like when

93
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:58,179
the TV is unplugged. Buy the TV from them. All right. I'll tell you if it's permanent. Thanks a

94
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:05,019
lot, dude. Now this is burned into my monitor. Just have a screensaver. How is it emitting

95
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:12,840
blue light if it's unplugged? Oh, it's not unplugged. That's okay. I see. I see. But that's

96
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:28,539
just what it looks like when it's turned on. Okay. We need an update. Replace it. Replace the TV.

97
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:34,730
Can you imagine? Like just, I get him in touch with community Jake. It's just like, let's get,

98
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:49,960
let's get, let's get this person a new TV. It's your fault. I love that though. That's so funny.

99
00:16:49,960 --> 00:17:01,210
We need an update. Buy this TV and put it in your house. They're very active on discord right now.

100
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:22,009
It's too funny. Put it up on the Reddit shelf. Yeah. Maybe if that's actually real, that's too

101
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:27,859
funny. Maybe we'll have to get you in touch with community Jake. Let's see. Uh, see what we can do

102
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:38,019
for you. Cause that's absolutely hysterical that you like are going to get like in trouble. Put it

103
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:44,150
up as a third monitor. There's no way the burning happens like that permanently. I don't know. It's

104
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,490
really funny. Regardless. It looks real to me. Use your head German. It's not real. It's funny

105
00:17:50,490 --> 00:18:01,269
though. You're going to get scammed. I didn't say this was going to happen. I just said we need,

106
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:13,339
we need some extra evidence and some extra proof that it was real. I need to write this down. Note

107
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:22,740
funny equals real. I didn't say funny. I said we need a little more evidence. Okay. We need to do

108
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:37,619
some more training as he didn't do it last time. Don't fail it again, please. All right. Good.

109
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:54,009
Even if it's fake, the idea is really funny. Yeah. All right. The image view naked on stream

110
00:18:54,009 --> 00:19:06,170
is burned into my monitor. What should I do? Now let me be very clear about this. Very clear.

111
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:13,480
This is a, this is funny. There's a funny little thing that happened. I, I ain't replacing all your

112
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,069
TVs. Okay. If you go buy an OLED TV today and deliberately burn an image of my face on it,

113
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:26,539
I ain't fucking replacing it. I just, let's be very clear about this. You're doing it on your

114
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:33,670
own free will. I have nothing to do with that. I'm going to make that very clear in before the

115
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:40,470
wave of OLED TV burning images that like, dude, I fucking left the TV on and it burned an image

116
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:56,309
of you and oh my God, what do I do about it? Help me. I'm sorry. Not happening. Oh, it's,

117
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:08,970
it's calamity's birthday. Yeah. So if you want to do that, that's up to you. I got nothing to do

118
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:36,180
with it. I got a lot of money. How old is Cosmic Andy? Cosmic Andy is two years old at this point

119
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:44,380
now. My dad saw a video of yours. He had a heart attack. You owe, no, no, we're not going down

120
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:53,750
this road. Not going down this road today. Now let's get three mint leaves and let's get three

121
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:21,190
nuts oil. Oh, I can only hold two. Okay. Fine. Okay. Uh, I actually am going to, no, I won't do

122
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:36,779
nuts oil and we're going to do normal skill training. How does it feel to be a permanent

123
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:45,849
screen saver skill? Let's go. I'm doing this in the wrong order. Okay. I got to, I'll fix it next

124
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:59,019
week. Remember there's a lack of, there's a lack of worst hair nominees. I don't think that just

125
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:16,900
means my hair looks better this year. I need to do 50 beam usages. All right. Keep counting. And

126
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:26,890
we have to do the mint leaf. I wonder when we're going to get, when is he going to get too old?

127
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:44,009
Hey Yorn, thanks for the five. Give me it to yourselves. He's on death store now. No, he's not.

128
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:50,940
He's got like at least not a year or two. This monster has one of the longest lifespans. Exactly.

129
00:22:50,940 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't tell me that it, that he's going to die. Won't be able to handle it. It's literally just

130
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:10,119
a wall dude. It's going to live a long time. It might. Tablets training. It's got a normal

131
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:19,319
lifespan of 410 game weeks. Oh nice. Aaron tree. Okay. So if this is Aaron tree,

132
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,920
all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good, good, good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

133
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,900
Stressed out. I know. I know. I know. I know. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

134
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:48,460
I got a bunch of dumb items. What is all this shit? Ooh, just eat this. Is this the new release? It

135
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,940
is. This game is currently on steam right now. It's a bundle of the first and second game. You

136
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,710
get them both. Uh, they are, and there it's also on iOS too right now, I think, which is amazing.

137
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:09,859
And it's on the switch. God, I hope they make another one. Like just make another monster

138
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:15,769
rancher. I know it sucks because they need like, they need like 10 million people to buy this game

139
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:20,859
to make it worth doing another one. I don't know if it's going to happen. Whatever number they need

140
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:34,180
to hit. I hope they hit because I would really love a new generation monster rancher video game.

141
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:41,910
All right. I need to buy much more of this stuff. Actually, hold on. I can sell this crap too. Can

142
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:56,980
I? Stimulate a monster's abilities. Can you get banned for doing these drugs? This will temporarily

143
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:06,019
stimulate a monster's abilities. What does it do? Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to sell some of

144
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:17,319
this stuff. The magic banana. I'm just going to sell it. I don't want to use it unless maybe I

145
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:24,089
should just use it. We have at least two or three monster rancher lore masters. It's going to reduce

146
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:31,539
your lifespan. Don't use it. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right. I'll just sell it.

147
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:43,740
I need to make room for leaves and, you know, sell the mango. I don't want it. Sell the banana.

148
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,339
I don't want it. I don't even know what it does. I think it reduces lifespan. 500 for this. Holy

149
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:56,299
shit. All right. That's pretty good. I'm going to keep the disc chips because you can combine them,

150
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:04,250
right? And when you actually combine monsters. All right. Now we need at least two more mint

151
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:22,950
leaves and four more nuts oils while the sale is here. Okay. Five, four. I'm about to use one of

152
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:33,220
these anyways. So, all right. Okay. I had a dream that you were streaming yourself cutting

153
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:50,180
stirs breaks. Why? Okay. I'm going to rest because I need to kind of reset this. Wow. What kind of

154
00:26:50,180 --> 00:27:05,779
dream is that? Cutting his breaks? All right. Well, let's do nuts oil. Let's do this right.

155
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:32,650
Mint leaf. Regular training. Nuts oil. Heavy training. I'm going to go take a nap. Dermot,

156
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,240
can you wake me up in a couple of hours? In two hours, I'll make sure to scream really,

157
00:27:37,240 --> 00:28:01,769
really loud and just make sure you have your headphones on. Wait. Yes. Right. What a scream

158
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:19,140
timer. I'm not, that doesn't seem to be a screen timer. All right. Give us a big value here. Is

159
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:32,970
it cheating? That's cheating. Whatever. 700 intelligence should be enough to be able to

160
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:41,210
at least beat a rank. How long is the stream going to be? I don't know. So don't have fun.

161
00:28:41,769 --> 00:29:03,930
Do defense. I think it's too late to do defense. It's too late. I think we need to be able to

162
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:16,230
one hit anti people. Defense is worthless. I think they've changed a bunch of stuff in the game

163
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:24,220
or not change, but patched old broken shit that doesn't work anymore. Right. There was a bunch

164
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,779
of bugs in the original game that they just fixed. And I think it made some of the things

165
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:45,740
more valuable. At what point is the magic slab smarter than you? Probably now. I don't,

166
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,710
it's out of a thousand. So I wonder what my monster sheet would look like.

167
00:29:53,269 --> 00:30:02,200
Okay. So if it's out of a thousand, my monster sheet definitely looks like this.

168
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:16,890
Life is probably one 20 power, like one 41, like 50, like here intelligence, probably like 240.

169
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:26,119
So like down here skill, I'm putting up to like seven or 800, like here speed is probably like

170
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:46,809
one 40 and defense is zero. What do you mean? What fame is zero. That's not accurate.

171
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:55,000
Fame would be 30. All right. Who would, okay. At our peaks right now,

172
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,970
German nine, eight, five, or this slab in this game's universe, who is more popular

173
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:10,150
with the 18 to 35 demographic? I gotta make that very, very, very clear. No, I don't think so.

174
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:28,759
I think it's me. I think, I think I would be more popular. All right. Well, I, yeah, all those would

175
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:37,779
be pretty bad. So the last thing we did was, what did I eat? I, I such a stupid attention span.

176
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:46,470
It was, what was the last thing that I just did or the last thing I clicked on? Cause I need to

177
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:54,680
give a, you didn't do anything yet, but what was the last thing I did? I gave tablets. Okay. Okay.

178
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:27,900
Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right. Big success. Do it. Good. 656 intelligence

179
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:43,099
in there. When is the tournament? I think it's coming up soon in like a week or two.

180
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:58,390
I wonder if I can handle it. So I can do skill rest and then we'll, we'll go in for B cup.

181
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:16,789
I could get skill over 300, which would be big. Good. Excellent. I don't have that image anymore.

182
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:30,660
There we go. You want to peep the horror here. It's an old ass clock too. I like that clock.

183
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:40,660
I didn't even see that clock. That clock's awesome. All right. Rest up for the battle.

184
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,940
See if I can handle B rank. If, if, if this, this is a rank, if I beat this, I'll get to a rank.

185
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:06,650
What time is it on that clock? It is six, six, like six, like 17, six 18. I win.

186
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:16,869
You're in pretty good shape. It's very well. All right, let's do it. I hope I can handle this.

187
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:33,750
B rank. This is the big one. This is a huge deal. Official B rank cup. Let's go. I'm actually kind

188
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:56,889
of scared because we've not seen any of these people here. All right. Go. What is with it?

189
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,170
What's this defense? Oh, you're dead though, because that doesn't matter for intelligence.

190
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:21,130
It's over. Let's go. You know what to do. Stay back. Bye. Let's get this B rank, A rank today.

191
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:33,510
Get all the defense in the wrong places. People were not feeling this strategy before,

192
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:40,739
but here's where this all falls apart. If there's another really high intelligence,

193
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:50,329
high speed monster, that's the hard, complete hard opposite. That's like paper versus rock.

194
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:58,539
I absolutely lose that. So we just hope that's not anybody here. Whoa, look at that thing. I

195
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:07,059
think it was like a weird dinosaur wall versus wall. That wall does maybe that wall is power.

196
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,820
All right. I was actually really scared before. Now I think I'm all right.

197
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:27,940
Look like, like, like, like, like the bunny. I'll be high speed. This is still fine.

198
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,199
I just have to hit you once. I don't have to care about anything else. We can throw coins in the

199
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:41,179
air. All right. I do have to worry about that power though. That's a lot. I have no defense.

200
00:36:41,179 --> 00:37:03,369
We just stay back. 46% throw the coin in the air. We went if I miss it's over because I can't take

201
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:17,460
more than one hit. I don't think or two hits total. I don't like Cosmic Andy. Well, Cosmic

202
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:25,340
Andy is probably going to be dead. If I've been within the next, like one stream hour. So the

203
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,659
whole point is to get Cosmic Andy. I just keep forgetting their name up to a rank. So we unlock

204
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:39,769
the other monster types that we can unlock from the CD stuff. It looks like they're going to do

205
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:46,900
what they're supposed to do. As long as we beat B rank, we get access to like, I think five or

206
00:37:46,900 --> 00:38:00,949
six more breeds. That's good. All right. Wall versus wall. What do you got? All right. That's

207
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:11,340
speed. How do you even have speed that low? You built your character like a moron to spread out.

208
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:28,619
It's over. I went way too spread out. See you later. Hey, it's worked every time so far.

209
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:40,699
People, I don't know if I would vote against this right now. That's a bad idea. Remember,

210
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,019
there are some unlockable monsters that you can get by beating a D rank battle at a specific time.

211
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:53,340
Really? I actually might be able to beat a rank with this monster and that just opens up the flood

212
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:08,739
gates. What if you miss? Then I lose. But it looks like statistics are on our side today.

213
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:17,800
The official a rank match is way harder. I'm going to assume that this is not going to be the

214
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,210
character that I beat a rank with. I just wanted to get to a rank with this character because then

215
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:28,889
we can unlock some more stuff, do some combinations, have maybe some higher base stat monsters and go

216
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:43,800
from there. All right. Epsilon. It's like a robot. This looks like a rare monster. Very spread out.

217
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,460
I think I still, I just have to, I don't know if I'll one hit kill. That's a lot of speed.

218
00:39:49,019 --> 00:40:06,070
All right. I'm kind of scared. A lot of speed. Oh, it's over. It's actually over. If you missed

219
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,590
the first shot, it's over. Oh, no, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. I

220
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:30,869
can do it again. Hold on. Hold on. Yes. Different move. Okay. It's almost mathematically impossible

221
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:40,010
for me to lose the Hirate who needs to lose one more time. And I actually know I have to

222
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:57,880
win my next two. Okay. I destroyed Pirate though. That's the competition right now.

223
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,579
That wall has 25 speed. It means you're going to get hit by every single attack.

224
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:19,030
Nothing will miss you. All right. Sanjuras. This is the weird like sun one, right? I kind of want

225
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:35,380
one of these. That's so cool. Oh, oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I still think I'm okay.

226
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,289
The speed and the life I'm concerned about, but all we have to do is flip a coin

227
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:59,610
and percentages here. I knew it. I knew that just dumping every training regimen into

228
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:13,639
intelligence was the right call. I'm getting great coin flips though. I've only lost one coin flip

229
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:34,179
out of probably seven or eight times. Somebody said I'm missing a doctor's appointment for this.

230
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:41,849
No, go to your doctor's appointment. Trust me. You'll be pissed in a few days because whatever's

231
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:45,369
wrong, you're going to look back and be like, I fucking had an opportunity to go.

232
00:42:46,409 --> 00:43:06,699
Trust me. Too late. I already missed it. Oh, I'll watch the stream in the waiting room. All right.

233
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:20,170
Robe Neil. Robe Neil has not been doing very well. I don't know why. Stats are pretty good.

234
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:30,219
Really high health. What's the problem here? Just too spread out. Oh, it ain't my fucking problem.

235
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:48,460
It's taking fucking cemetery. Oh, oh, I can't go backwards. I just had to hit you once. Come

236
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:57,500
here. Back it up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What? Shit. Okay. Holy shit. That's the four

237
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:09,320
in a row that I've missed. All right. It doesn't matter. I just hit one. Back it up. Back it up.

238
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:21,980
Oh, you piece of shit. I'll be able to do one more. I need 24 guts. Come on. 22, 23, 24.

239
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:39,670
I lost. I lost. I actually lost. Well, here comes all the coin flips I'm going to lose in a row.

240
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:56,780
60% lost it seven or six or seven times in a row. I still win. Who has one loss?

241
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:07,050
Okay. Pyriteu is the only one that has two losses. If they lose the next match, I clenched it.

242
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:21,019
Yeah. Pyriteu just has to lose. All right. Who's Pyriteu going against?

243
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:35,369
Uh-huh. All right. I just can't lose this. I either can't lose this or Pyriteu has to lose

244
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:50,170
the next match. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yikes. Okay. I just have to get a hit

245
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:56,820
off first. Oh shit. It's Jerma. Right? Because that's exactly what I said my stats would look

246
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:11,829
like. I don't have wings. Coin flip. Not yet though. I just pissed him off.

247
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:30,539
Clenched it. All right. We got it. I just unlocked like a bunch of breeds. I love this game. This

248
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:48,250
game is so much fun. It really is. Rank alone doesn't unlock breeds. They have very cryptic

249
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:53,210
unlocks. Yeah. I know that there's probably like a more than a dozen breeds that you

250
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,530
have to do specific things for. But once you get to rank four, doesn't that unlock?

251
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:08,389
Four or five different breeds? Getting to that trainer rank four. No? Are you sure? I thought

252
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:23,320
it did. I guess it doesn't unlock shit. It doesn't? I thought it did. It unlocks a tournament that you

253
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:38,099
have to attend. Oh. It's something very specific for everyone. All right. Is there a good unlock

254
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:49,510
guide? I know there's a good website. What's it called? The Legend Cup, right? Isn't that a

255
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:57,429
good place to do it? Monster Rush to unlocking guide for all 38 breeds. Holy shit. There are

256
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:09,269
38 other breeds to unlock. Wow. All right. Let's go through this. I'm at 100 fame.

257
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:20,260
Okay. Some of them are locked behind errand trees. I'm a cryptic as hell.

258
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:28,730
Ooh, look at that increase. That's good. Okay. Achieve breeder rank of four, beat B rank,

259
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:37,659
and you need to purchase the first house upgrade. What the fuck? Okay. Hold on a minute. This is

260
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:46,539
ridiculous. If you have 17,000 gold or more on May 4th, Vinto will arrive and upgrade your

261
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:55,320
stable for 15,000 gold. This will unlock these two. Wait, I have to have a certain amount of

262
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:12,420
money on one day? Oh, okay. Okay. One of these is I have to achieve a rank four breeder and then

263
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:20,309
have to finish the expedition at Correa. So you have to send somebody that's at least B rank to

264
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:29,849
do the heavy errand tree, which is the Mandy desert between the months of March and August.

265
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:35,929
If the monster is uninjured, it will return with a spear. Your monster and the centaur will fight.

266
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:39,849
This will take an entire week. So you'll lose lifespan afterwards. You may use the

267
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:44,409
spear and combining to unlock the centaur. There's no particular penalty. What the fuck is all this?

268
00:49:49,579 --> 00:50:01,909
All right. So, um, cool. Very cool. You did a great job. Oh, this is kind of spoilery.

269
00:50:01,909 --> 00:50:08,869
Maybe I shouldn't be reading this. I want a silk cloth. Yeah, sure. Whatever.

270
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:17,289
Some of these are spoilery and some of these are literally impossible unless I did it step by step.

271
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:35,699
What are some of the easier ones? You must be on the ranch one week, four of May to trigger events.

272
00:50:39,449 --> 00:51:00,780
Okay. The Fimba versus IMA is every four years. Centaur is really easy to get.

273
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:16,710
Hello. It's an express mail from IMA. Oh, here we go. This is us being ranked four. Nice.

274
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:22,659
The expedition ones are pretty straightforward. I'll do those ones first. These other ones seem

275
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:34,250
kind of confusing. All right. We're ranked four. Cool. Why are you playing with a Minecraft block?

276
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:41,909
That Minecraft block is one hit killing every single monster. So I need to get, I need to

277
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:50,099
purchase a house upgrade. Remember for expeditions, you'll need to have your monster to have high

278
00:51:50,099 --> 00:52:05,050
life and high fame. He's at a hundred fame right now. Okay. So I need to, how do I get the first

279
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:14,949
house upgrade? It's January, January, February. When, when do I get to do this? His life stats

280
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:22,059
really low. You need high strength life and intelligence. I'm supposed to do that. I have

281
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:29,659
lots of money and just wait. Okay. So let's keep the training going then. I might be able to do

282
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:36,889
a rank next time. When's the next day? Wednesday. This one's four grand. All right. Here we go.

283
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:45,510
The official A cup is in a couple of months. You should have a separate expedition monster.

284
00:52:49,349 --> 00:53:01,909
All right. I love this. This is so much fun. Okay. Did I just start banking money? I mean,

285
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:05,909
do I just rest and then just do this and just bank money to make sure I can afford the house

286
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:11,269
upgrade? All right. Let's do that. Let's go wipe the floor with everybody in B rank.

287
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:14,309
They're a bunch of, they're a bunch of shitties. They never, what? They're never going to make it.

288
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:32,679
Just go there and fucking wipe the floor with them. Here we go. This is for just four grand.

289
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:41,340
This is quick too. This is a lower grade tourney. What? Your monster's fame will drop. Will it?

290
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:59,739
Maybe I shouldn't do this. Nevermind. Who cares? Make the money. Just do it. All right. Let's do

291
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:20,789
it. I don't care. I need money. Oh, the serious cup smurfing. I got to try to get to at least 10

292
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:28,550
to 20,000. Then that makes the next monster so much easier to train. I don't have to worry

293
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:48,760
about anything. I would kill about these guys in one hit. We're fine. Give me that money.

294
00:54:48,760 --> 00:55:02,570
You're going back to middle school to beat up children. That's not accurate. Going back to

295
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:10,010
middle school to beat up children would be doing E rank or D rank. This is B rank. These are grownups.

296
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:23,480
Not as good as me. This is kind of unfair. You basically just made a gun.

297
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:36,630
What is that move that they have? What's that? What's that like Verizon tower signal?

298
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:53,480
What does that move do? It's a 5G move. And what's the T-Mobile data thing do?

299
00:55:54,119 --> 00:56:18,010
This one was quick. Called Soundwave. It has an S rank hit rate, but it's weak.

300
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:28,090
I actually might want that. Because if you miss, then it sucks. Being able to guarantee

301
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:38,059
a hit at least to have some damage. Oh, confused. It would have been scary if I didn't have

302
00:56:41,909 --> 00:57:11,340
high intelligence. All right. This is easy money. This is easy money for you guys, too. I imagine

303
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,929
some of you guys, I don't know. Yeah. Five and a half million versus 150K.

304
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:22,300
I mean, 150K, I'm looking for the huge payout, but I don't think that's going to happen.

305
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:35,130
4,500 bucks. Don't drop by that much, right? Okay. I'm going to keep doing B ranks. Especially the

306
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:54,500
four monster ones. And I keep getting bonuses and shit. This is awesome. I want polish. Finally

307
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:13,110
got over 10 grand. Yeah, fine. I need 15 grand, you said, right? What? 20 grand? What's the next

308
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:26,710
one? Free for all elimination. Can I hang here? Do you think I could do it? Or is it going to be

309
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:34,440
way too hard? Probably not. Okay. Is this one here? Ooh, five grand and only four entries in its B.

310
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:45,239
Perfect. All right. Let's rest. Heavy train. Oh no. Fuck it. Why? Heavy train. Who needs to sleep

311
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:58,309
when you do this? Remember my wife is divorcing me because I lost all my channel points because

312
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:05,900
of Cosmic Andy. What the fuck? Very, very weird thing to be divorced for. I feel like there's

313
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:15,579
more going on. I don't think it's, I don't think it's just the fact that Cosmic Andy lost your

314
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:48,500
channel point. Okay. Let's go. He was joking. How am I supposed to know that? No, it's all right.

315
00:59:51,610 --> 01:00:02,300
You're well. That's fine. Let's go ahead and do the mint leaf for your stretch. Please throw the next

316
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:14,940
fight so we can get a huge payout on people that are doubters. Eh, I want the money. Sorry. All right,

317
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:23,349
I got this week and the next week. So we'll do another big training and then we'll rest and not

318
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:51,369
no. Yeah. Don't fail it again. Really? Well, now it's a rest week. Tablets. Just do the A tournament.

319
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:59,989
Somebody said that the A tournament might be way too difficult right now. You're ignoring chat.

320
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:12,150
Why do you think I read chat? I don't even look. I have not looked at the chat in probably like

321
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:18,329
two or three years streaming. I don't even look. I just kind of guess what you guys might be talking

322
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:30,219
about. And then I just kind of blend in. All right, we need to rest. We're just going for A.

323
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:39,639
Let's go. I don't even care. Train a shitload and we're going right to A. Rest up. Let's go.

324
01:01:40,360 --> 01:02:12,219
All right, come on. Let's see it. Train. Get over 700 intelligence. Nice. The A tournament will be

325
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:16,780
too late for the house upgrade as I've understood it. You have to have the money by the first week

326
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:29,480
of March. Level down defense shit. Don't I have the money though? Everywhere. First week of March.

327
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,199
I have 10 grand. Isn't it like, isn't this two upgrades? I don't have the first one.

328
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:44,380
It's 15. I don't have the first upgrade. It's May for the first one. Is this this two upgrades?

329
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:53,739
There's a house upgrade and a stable upgrade. It's May 4th. First one is 15k. May not March.

330
01:02:53,739 --> 01:03:21,929
Oh, okay. Well, I think I'm all right. Yeah, I'm good. I need a press release. It's guilt.

331
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:34,550
You need 7k for the first one. Okay, I have that. Press release? No, I said stress relief.

332
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:47,260
Ah, shit. We got to do a press release. I got to do a press release. Cosmic Calamity. I got to be

333
01:03:47,260 --> 01:04:21,780
Cosmic Calamity's PR person. Comes a bit. No, not really. Great. Yes. Come on. Well, that's good

334
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:33,690
enough. I need a face cam. I don't need a face cam. You know exactly what I look like. No, you don't

335
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:45,000
have to count my nose hairs. You know how what my face looks like right now. I want the stress

336
01:04:45,000 --> 01:05:01,909
reduction. Official tournaments at the end of the month. Okay, keep going. I need items. All right.

337
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:10,710
Make sure I have over $7,000 though. I might actually be getting to the end of the training

338
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:19,159
regimen. My understanding here, this is accurate. Eventually they stop getting like really even

339
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:25,610
worth training stat increases. They're like less than two or three of them like per stat increase.

340
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:32,550
It's no longer. Oh, plus 10 plus 20 stats. It's like plus three. So probably getting close. Maybe

341
01:05:32,550 --> 01:06:00,340
this one or two more weeks. Yeah, definitely falling out of prime at this point. Heard about

342
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:13,269
you from Reddit. Everybody hears about me from every place that I don't participate in. Let's

343
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:28,010
do a big one. I close my eyes every time you do a face cam. It's probably a post-it note on your

344
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:37,260
screen where the face cam is. 700 intelligence finally got it. Yes. Now I can beat a rank. I can

345
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:55,050
just laser beam just lightning melt everybody. You don't participate in Reddit. I read it sometimes.

346
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:02,329
I'm not an active participator in Reddit though. 20 weeks we got. We got this one.

347
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:46,539
This is a skill. Skill. Rest. A. Nice. 350 or so. All right. Good. Rest. A rank. That's what this,

348
01:07:46,539 --> 01:08:00,230
I made this title. The title says A rank. So I better beat it. Let me save the game in case

349
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:19,060
I get instantly killed and died. You know what I mean? Whoa. What happened? Oh, oops. This is

350
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:28,340
the big one. I've never done this before. I've, I've, I used to play this game when I was like 16.

351
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:39,430
I never got this far. Played this game again a few years ago. Did not get this far. See if I can do

352
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:47,270
this. You could do an air entry and get the sound wave. It's a hundred percent chance at this point.

353
01:08:47,989 --> 01:09:17,930
Oh, I'm kind of nervous. Kaplan. Kaplan. What is that? Okay. Whoa. 585 speed. Oh god. Only

354
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:32,090
200. Okay. I'm never going to hit this thing. Can I even hit this? Oh, I hit you. Oh, I got an onion.

355
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:45,750
Oh, an onion ring. I blew his head off. I blew his head off. What the fuck? Oh my god. The force

356
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:57,590
buying that one. 30% chance. I had to hit that arrow. It was over. By the way, uh, I'm probably

357
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:04,060
going to lose this tournament because we're not going to get lucky again like that. That was a

358
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:09,720
pog moment, but minus two. I know. I just, it's, I heard the exact same sound. It was that like,

359
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:35,020
I have to fight a dragon. Oh boy. These are all pretty rare monsters. It seems. Dragon. I'm scared.

360
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:49,720
Oh my god. 600 power, 600 intelligence. How do you even do that? How do you have that much

361
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:58,699
training time to get it there? I think this is a loss. Let's have faith though. Have faith,

362
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:02,380
have faith, have faith. Don't let him get up. Do it again. Have faith, have faith. I just beat

363
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:05,659
this motherfucker. I just killed him. That was the guy to beat right there and I just won.

364
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:29,850
Nothing can stop the laser beam. Those were low percentage chances too. Although I don't know.

365
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:34,819
Some of these other things could be high, high intelligence, high power. That was the worst

366
01:11:34,819 --> 01:11:46,380
possible thing. That dragon just had to do one move and I lose. I'm surprised he's not playing

367
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:51,979
the monster rancher DX. This is, this is monster rancher DX. This is the one that just came up.

368
01:11:56,439 --> 01:12:07,319
Team wall. Yeah. All right. Arculon. This is also 2-0. Arculon. You got a cool name too.

369
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:26,729
Wait, this is a robot scorpion hybrid? That thing is awesome. All right. But it's just no match

370
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:35,079
for the flip a coin and you die. Oh, I can do the same thing. You know, you know, I can do the same

371
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:55,800
thing. It's over. It's over. Shit. Oh, okay. It's still winnable. It is as long as Arculon loses

372
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:20,409
once. Okay. More. The dragon won. I'm not the only person that beat the dragon. Just by sheer luck.

373
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:38,739
Okay. Lamb sweet. This is a must win scenario here. That speed. This is a must win. Come on.

374
01:13:38,739 --> 01:14:04,890
Let's go flip the coin. Boy. Oh no. No. We just got lucky on the first two.

375
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:25,210
Most people have lost twice. This is not over yet. All right. Arculon needs to lose. All right.

376
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:34,409
Okay. It's still doable. All right. Sharkin has not won a single match. So I'm not that concerned.

377
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:56,760
How? 60% chance. Let's go. You got that off first. Are you shitting me? You fucking piece of crap.

378
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:03,270
Are you kidding me? You saw I was spamming it. Give me a break. I'm sitting here spamming the

379
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:20,149
button. Yeah, it's over. I'm just going to reload the save. Through that. I'm reloading the save.

380
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:42,579
Okay. If I don't get any prize money, I'm reloading the save. That's not even the move I wanted to do.

381
01:15:52,949 --> 01:16:14,119
Oh shit. Fuck. I'm reloading. I'm done. I just wanted to see if I could do A rank. This doesn't

382
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:24,520
even count. Like I was just checking. It doesn't count. I was checking. We're going back into

383
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:47,770
training. You just need to level speed a little bit. Stream title is clickbait. No, it's not.

384
01:16:47,770 --> 01:17:08,729
I got to A rank. I didn't say I was going to beat A rank. Oh, that's not enough. That's just a waste

385
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:18,859
of time. We could have been training. We could have been training. When was the last time I

386
01:17:18,859 --> 01:17:23,430
saved the game? Oh my God. Wait, I just fed him a potato. When was the last time I've saved?

387
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:49,579
Did I save right before that? Oh no. Never feed a potato. Ever. Yeah. Fuck this. Let's go.

388
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:54,619
Okay. We're not doing that. Instead. Yes, rank. No, thanks. Back to the training.

389
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:16,970
Try just doing air entry. Do B for the money. B for the money. That's eight. That's only three

390
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:24,899
thousand for eight. Eight entries. I need the money. That's going to take a long time. All right.

391
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:37,500
Fine. Let's just go farm this. Speed run. We don't care about what everybody's stats are. All we

392
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:47,979
care about is mashing A and hopefully the beam hits them. These are, these are new monsters.

393
01:18:48,619 --> 01:19:02,840
All right. This is easy. Whoa. Look at this. I think it's cool. All right. Come on. I've spammed it.

394
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:24,500
I've been spamming it. What the fuck? No more swearing. He said, realistically your attack is

395
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:29,380
A plus right now in power, but you need either high dodge or defense to counter that RNG.

396
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:37,340
Yeah. I think it's probably going to have to be speed. We'll just work on speed for a little bit.

397
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:43,850
I'm just going to hammer speed, speed, speed, speed, speed and just make them drink nuts oil.

398
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:58,869
I don't think we need. Okay. I don't need any more intelligence. I should solely be focusing on

399
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:23,100
trying to get speed over two or three hundred, right? That's it. That's cool looking too. Shit.

400
01:20:23,739 --> 01:20:41,380
Oh, that's not good. All right. I need to hold back. Try to stay back. Didn't even do anything.

401
01:20:41,859 --> 01:21:07,529
That was a dinosaur, by the way. That was not even a dog. The T-Rex people are saying,

402
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:26,220
what are you talking about? That was a, that was not a lion. It was a stegosaurus. All right.

403
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:49,020
This is one hit kill guaranteed. You realize that they didn't sample actual dinosaur sounds, right?

404
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:55,479
How do we even know what dinosaurs sounded like? We've given them these crazy big roars,

405
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:09,460
the T-Rex roar and big growls. What are they saying? Like birds. I met T-Rex probably was like,

406
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:30,899
they were probably birds. Aren't they like descendants from birds? Birds or dinosaurs?

407
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:37,430
I'm not, I'm serious. There are a lot of experts that think we have dinosaurs all wrong.

408
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:42,970
They may have had just feathers all over them. They weren't like these lizard skinned animals.

409
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:49,239
They may have had feathers all over them. Oh, let me just kill this guy real quick.

410
01:22:54,739 --> 01:23:00,539
Wow. That was pretty, that was a cool move. Come on. I don't suppose we're feathered. Yeah.

411
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:12,100
Okay. Wait, let me pay attention because I somehow just got hurt bad. Don't let this guy win. Come on.

412
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:34,359
Don't let him win. I just hit him once. 24 guts. Do it. Yeah. T-Rex didn't roar kind of rummed.

413
01:23:36,329 --> 01:24:00,020
What is rum? The rum? Like that? I didn't mean to do that, but I just got to the end of the coffee.

414
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:15,270
Wait, let me take a guess. Is the rumming like this? Like, is that what it might be?

415
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:23,930
Kind of like use your throat and your vocal cords with your mouth closed a little bit.

416
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:42,970
Like the velociraptors do in Jurassic Park. It's like the rumbling alligators make. Oh, okay.

417
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:55,750
I got five health. All right. Let's just insult this person. Oh no. Okay. Good. Did my BM work?

418
01:24:56,390 --> 01:25:06,329
So you're talking about the sound that it sounds like an alligator when they open their mouth and

419
01:25:06,329 --> 01:25:10,729
they make a noise. It sounds like they're releasing steam from their body or that they have a gas

420
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:39,380
leak inside of their throat. No, that's a hiss. It's a low croak. I mean like this. All of you

421
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:46,710
just prepared, just wincing, waiting for that noise. And I even see somebody said minus two

422
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:54,229
because you wanted to be the first one to write it, but I didn't do anything. So you look a little

423
01:25:54,229 --> 01:26:23,300
silly now, don't you? I want one of these big dogs. There's the money. I imagined it and it

424
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:40,899
made me cringe. So minus two. Yeah. These take too long just to get three or 4,000 bucks.

425
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:56,069
This is too long. I'd rather just train them. I like those little snail guys. How do I get

426
01:26:56,069 --> 01:27:11,590
one of those? Did you do the fast forward mode? There is a fast forward mode, but I don't want

427
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:14,789
to do fast forward mode. I feel like I would accidentally screw something up and I would just

428
01:27:14,789 --> 01:27:38,340
die. The snail guy sucks. Looks cool. Fast forward is good when you train. The Papa's B cup in July,

429
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:46,310
it's worth 9,000 bucks and it gives you pure gold. All right. This has to be the money farm

430
01:27:46,310 --> 01:28:01,319
character to get ready for the real character. I'm fine with that. Okay. We got the nine speed.

431
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:14,170
That's exactly what I wanted to have happen and the health. That's good. I want polish. Yeah,

432
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:30,500
you deserve it. This stream is very cozy. That's nice. Sometimes it's fun just to play a game and

433
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:39,579
hang out. All right. I need some help from the lore masters. Is tablets still worth doing at this

434
01:28:39,579 --> 01:28:52,090
point or should I just feed a cup of jelly for the stress? I need some lore master help. Please

435
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:56,970
don't try to level speed. Cosmic speed is literally one of the worst in the entire game.

436
01:28:57,609 --> 01:29:10,899
It's defense is pretty good though. Really tablets is also stress minus. Okay. So wait,

437
01:29:10,899 --> 01:29:21,800
they have the worst speed in the game. Does that also mean they train the worst for speed? Yes.

438
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:29,750
Okay. So then what do I, what do I do? Well, I just have to really rely on just keeping intelligence

439
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:32,789
and skill high enough so I can be the first person to attack and kill somebody in one hit.

440
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:44,600
Defense is worthless. Defense. People saying defense, but I've heard that defense is not good

441
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:51,539
or just farm money. That's why galaxy is bad. So this is why this is the worst character in the

442
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:59,500
game because okay, I'm beginning to understand because you can't really level these up because

443
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:10,279
he sucks and you get really shit increases when you do. I get it. That's why nobody plays with

444
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:16,199
this guy. I need to get a new skill. All right. I'm just going to do air entry. What's there? What

445
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:26,539
is it? Let's go for it. Let's do an air entry. It's good. I mean, it's $2,000 though. This one's

446
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:38,710
through. Okay. I'll do this one. Just make him the moneymaker. That's a good idea. Yeah. But the

447
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:45,979
double beam, as long as I keep using beam raise life is the most important defensive step in the

448
01:30:45,979 --> 01:30:57,079
game. Okay. So I got a few options here. One of the ways to make this character really, really

449
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:06,149
okay is if I keep doing the beam move after I do it 50 times, I can then do an air entry and get

450
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:18,010
double beam, but I already kill things in one hit anyway. So two hits. Do I really need the double

451
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:33,720
beam? Oh, okay. Look at his gain. His life is D. His defense gain is B. The same as your intelligence

452
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:46,840
gain. Life gain is D. Defense is B. You're literally at 49 out of 50 beam usages. Okay. Yes, do it.

453
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:52,250
It's content. Okay. That's all I needed here. So I need to do this at the end of the month to just

454
01:31:52,250 --> 01:32:01,020
to do the 50. He's leaving. He's not leaving. His ranch is huge. He promised a face cam in a minute.

455
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:18,069
All right. I'm going to let's do training. I have any more oil. I do just do heavy life training

456
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:37,960
then. Or should I just just spam life increase, which is just run, just do run over and over again.

457
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:49,340
Do defense, do defense, do defense, defense and life. So just do swim, defense, adult life will

458
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:58,500
make him expedition capable. Maybe I'll just swim. I should get it. I'm going to don't swim.

459
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:12,920
This is late game. Shit. I don't know what to do. I've never gotten this far. You don't. I'm going

460
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:21,180
to do swim. Swim is minus intelligence. Oh shit. You're right. All right. I'm just going to run.

461
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:53,859
Just run. Just go run. Meditate only. Oh, yucky. Ugly. Three. Huh? Three. That's it. He's getting

462
01:33:53,859 --> 01:34:05,340
old. Upgrade intelligence and skill to become an actual one shot sniper. Please train defense.

463
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:24,520
Hold on. I need to sneeze. See if I can, can I catch it? Did I get it? Did I not get it? Yeah,

464
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:45,699
I did. Didn't I? All right. I don't know what to do. Speed and intelligence. Just keep running.

465
01:34:45,699 --> 01:34:53,460
Defense is better than you think. It's against intelligence and power. Int and pow just also

466
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:59,289
scale damage resistance against themselves slightly. All right. I'm going to go for it.

467
01:34:59,289 --> 01:35:18,680
Let me see. I'm going to do endure. Endure. Let's check it. Success, right? Four defense. That's not

468
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:33,529
good, man. Double beam has worse accuracy and you don't need the damage. Sound wave has the best

469
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:43,590
accuracy in the game. Get sound wave instead. All right. Where do I go for sound wave? Just choose

470
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:56,619
one with your eyes closed. Sound wave sucks. You guys have a lot of different opinions.

471
01:35:56,619 --> 01:36:08,569
Should I just send him on an errant tree and who cares? We haven't had a discount in the whole

472
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:15,300
time we've been playing. Go to the beach and get sound wave. I'm going to the beach and I'm getting

473
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:35,750
sound wave. Rest. Don't miss the house upgrade. Yes. Who is it? You have mail. Look at this.

474
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:52,500
Oh, it's errant tree, isn't it? That's not bad though. All right. April. So help me out here.

475
01:36:52,500 --> 01:37:06,739
When does this happen? The first week of May. So I need to just stay here the fourth week of May.

476
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:17,880
So I need to be on the ranch here. So we're going to continue to train or I'll just do this and just

477
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:36,359
get money. The video for this stream is going to be five minutes long. That's not like 30 minutes.

478
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:56,060
All right. This will be easy money. I need 17k to activate it. Will I have it after this match?

479
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:13,850
I was at 12, 13, 14, 15. I'll be at 15. All right. That's not good. How do you 93% chance

480
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:20,039
that they missed? Will you fuck off with this bullshit already? Really? Am I actually going to

481
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:29,699
lose? No, I'm not. I'm going to get to scream in five minutes to wake that person up for you.

482
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:54,260
Oh, it was a single elimination. All right. This one was really easy. What about the toxic monster?

483
01:38:54,260 --> 01:39:05,500
Yeah, I just have to be able to unlock it. That was a 500 damage crit. I feel bad.

484
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:25,640
We need to put a poll in the chat. Very important. Because I can now get the strongest beam move in

485
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:36,729
the game, right? I can go get double beam. Do I get double beam, which is more damage than single

486
01:39:36,729 --> 01:39:47,340
beam, but less accurate? And we actually just go for 30%, 40% kill everybody in one hit. Or do we

487
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:59,619
go get scream, which is almost a guaranteed hit, but doesn't do as much damage. I think we need a

488
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:19,020
poll for this. I don't know either one I would be fine with. You lose single beam. You do not.

489
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:32,279
Whoa, this is getting me more increases than if I were to heavily train the character. Holy shit.

490
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:49,180
Do double beam for extra brain dead build. Uh, have some tablets. All right. I got 15 grand.

491
01:40:49,180 --> 01:41:00,979
What do we got? Looks like pretty unanimously. People do not want double beam. They want scream.

492
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:20,699
Just get double beam and then saves come until it works. I forgot to buy this shit. Wait, what is

493
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:29,770
this? What kind of seed is this? I don't know. A wholesaler often brings in new items. He said he

494
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:36,250
got this at parry parry region. I wonder what seed it is. I've never seen this before. It's not even

495
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:43,590
in the textbook. I will give it to you because Jax and cult are my loyal customers. Thank you,

496
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:58,539
auntie. What does that do? It grows into a monster. Holy smokes. Do I have to grow it?

497
01:41:58,539 --> 01:42:21,300
How do I do that? In like three years. Okay. Nevermind. Cause this is going to take a long

498
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:44,970
time. It's 10 years actually. Oh, all right. We got, I can't do, wait, there's only four entries.

499
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:57,060
Okay. Air entry, air entry. Then we're going for, we're going for air rank again. Air entry. No,

500
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:05,350
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that because the, right. Okay. All right. Speed

501
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:26,920
intelligence. What do you think? Let's do leap. Power down. Who gives a shit? I need speed. I'm

502
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:32,260
not training anymore. There's no reason to. It does so much fatigue and so much stress for

503
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:40,260
barely any gain at all. Just have to do the tournaments now. Wait, let's bury the seed in

504
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:47,899
the corner of the ranch. I wonder what kind of plant it is. Let's wait patiently and see. Let's

505
01:43:47,899 --> 01:43:59,590
wait for 10 years. Yeah. Fuck it. I think I'm going for it. I'm going to save here. I'm going

506
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:14,810
to rest. We're going to see if I can win. It's only four people. Save the game. I can get lucky

507
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:39,800
four times. Hold on. Should I do? Okay. Rest, rest of it. A rank has insanely fast monsters.

508
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,779
That's all going to be about coming flips. I think I'm in, it's only four monsters though. I did,

509
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:56,520
I beat two in a row. I beat two in a row. Dragon was insane. It was horrifying. I beat it in one

510
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:14,569
hit at Ray. I beg of you. It's your best move. One thing at a time. I don't remember beating

511
01:45:14,569 --> 01:45:20,869
any of these people, but we have improved since the last time. All right. It's just, it's flip

512
01:45:20,869 --> 01:45:38,859
a coin. Let's go. I just have to get it right now. Again. Do it. Yes. Oh, what do I do? Stay back.

513
01:45:40,659 --> 01:45:51,770
Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Dodge it. Oh, yeah. Oh, dodge it please.

514
01:45:52,489 --> 01:46:10,420
I have health. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Fuck you. Whatever. You literally only have one chance a

515
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:14,899
year to get Ray. It's June 1st. Please do whatever you can to get it. It's the Korea

516
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:50,899
expedition. June 1st? I don't even have expeditions. How do I get those? How do I do that?

517
01:46:50,899 --> 01:47:02,710
They mean Erentria. Okay. All right. Let's get lucky here. Not happening. We need Ray. Bad.

518
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:33,020
Holy shit. Okay. Well, whatever. I'm just going to be able to save. Fuck it. Remember the game.

519
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:50,300
Okay. So we're not doing that. I still can't do it. I do need to wait till the end of this month.

520
01:47:50,300 --> 01:48:05,859
So let's just rest or training. How about straight up speed or speed? Just do it. Whatever.

521
01:48:05,859 --> 01:48:23,609
Oh, that person needs to wake up. Right. Hold on. We help. Plus one. Why even do any of these

522
01:48:23,609 --> 01:48:46,170
anymore? All right. We got to wake that person up. I got it. All right. Give me one sec. It's

523
01:48:46,170 --> 01:49:09,300
been two hours, right? It's too early. No, it's not too early. Okay. Let's do. It's four o'clock

524
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:35,289
p.m. It's four o'clock p.m. You're up. Turn it off. Turn it off. I hate that alarm. Everybody does.

525
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:45,430
I was sleeping. That was not a scream. I'm not going to actually scream and like hurt your ears.

526
01:49:52,949 --> 01:50:08,420
All right. Just, just go to sleep. Just wake up tomorrow. Here we go. It's about our house.

527
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:12,439
You know, people say the might of the house is the might of the trainer. Our house is getting

528
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:20,619
too small for us. We have money. Total cost 5,000 gold to renovate the house. Go for it.

529
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:28,420
I will ask the carpenter. Jax, this is Binto, the carpenter. He's the number one carpenter around

530
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:35,989
here. Stop it, Colt. Although our motto is fast, cheap, and detailed, you will not be disappointed.

531
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:42,649
I'll be looking forward to seeing your job, Binto. Oh, but we cannot concentrate when someone

532
01:50:42,649 --> 01:50:49,939
comes into our site. I have to ask you to visit somewhere while we are working. When we finish

533
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:58,970
our job, I'll come and get you. Wait, what do you mean leave? Got it. I asked to stay at the

534
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:06,810
Pabbs house, so don't worry. Of course, leave it to me. What does this actually do? How about that?

535
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:13,300
Pretty neat, huh? What, you're done already? I told you our motto was fast, cheap, and detailed.

536
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:21,340
I'll take the money. Ask us anytime. I don't know what to say. It's a good house, I guess.

537
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:29,029
That takes care of all of it, huh? More inventory space. Oh, it is a little house. That's cute.

538
01:51:29,029 --> 01:51:40,329
Are we sure that it didn't just go in there and move the furniture? Okay, somebody said

539
01:51:40,329 --> 01:51:46,069
first of June is the most important thing in the world, so I need to sleep here. Wait,

540
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:58,149
that's sleeping two days in a row. Wait, getting Cosmic's life to 140 or higher will let you go on

541
01:51:58,149 --> 01:52:08,409
the first expedition, which can potentially unlock a new monster. I have 140 health. Dude, I got 187.

542
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:24,569
Let's go back to sleep. Double rest. I don't care. 187. You meet the requirements. You just need to be

543
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:37,779
ready to go next week. All right, I'm ready to go next week. He's nice and rested. I'm going to do

544
01:52:37,779 --> 01:52:59,300
tablets. Check your house for asbestos and radon. Yes, who is it? Is this Jax's residence? Yes,

545
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:09,140
it is. Who are you? Oh, this is my calling card. Oh, here we go. Dr. Talico, Corbel University.

546
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:14,390
And what is the purpose of your visit? This is a serious question, dude. Do you have a

547
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:21,420
carbon monoxide detector and does it work? Yes, I do. Don't worry. What? Yes, I do. I check my

548
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:31,640
smoke detectors, my carbon monoxide detectors. Yes, so don't worry. Okay, once upon a time when

549
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:38,170
the world was one big continent, God sealed the monsters into disk stones and hid all the disk

550
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:45,960
stones in a shrine. This is when we say put us on the do not call list and close the door. I have

551
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:56,020
ascertained that the legendary shrine is located on this continent. Aha. No, aha. It is a great

552
01:53:56,020 --> 01:54:02,680
discovery. Isn't that what aha means? I must go there. Well, what does it have to do with us?

553
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:09,449
It looks like that there are various obstacles on the way to the shrine. I want you guys to go on

554
01:54:09,449 --> 01:54:14,380
this adventure with me. Pay you and give you some of the items we find during the adventure.

555
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:21,819
Huh? In order to get rid of those obstacles and proceed with this adventure, we have to use a

556
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:28,090
monster. Strong monster, that is. I came here because Pabs told me. Oh, you know Pabs. You

557
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:34,199
should have said that in the beginning. Now I understand. Jax, your monster might get injured.

558
01:54:34,199 --> 01:54:45,270
Do you make it go with him? You can now get the big dog. Really? Save the game? I don't think I

559
01:54:45,350 --> 01:55:04,789
can. I can't. You can get a phoenix from this. Um, does it autosave? Okay. Let's go. You don't

560
01:55:04,789 --> 01:55:13,619
know what's going to happen. Something might injure your monster. Are you sure? Yes. Dr. Talco,

561
01:55:13,619 --> 01:55:20,470
we can let it go. It's just what I expected. Jax the Wonderful. And can either Caldor or Jax

562
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:26,060
come with me on the adventure? I can't handle your monster by myself. You even know my name.

563
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:33,449
Okay, I'll go with you. Well done. Let's go. Are we all ready? Yeah. We better take off before you

564
01:55:33,449 --> 01:55:42,340
change your mind. I'm leaving, Jax. Phoenix Volcano Adventure. Prologue to the adventure.

565
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:58,010
We finally arrived at the Phoenix Volcano. First, let's set up a base camp. Let's get started.

566
01:55:58,970 --> 01:56:03,979
But before we start, let me explain a little about the adventure. At the beginning of an adventure,

567
01:56:03,979 --> 01:56:10,890
energy points will be given depending on your monster's life status. What? Energy? Yes, energy.

568
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:16,979
This energy will be the life gauge for this adventure. The energy will be consumed with each

569
01:56:16,979 --> 01:56:22,550
step your monster makes. It'll also be reduced if the monster checks the inside of a building.

570
01:56:22,869 --> 01:56:35,140
Or moves of rock that might be sitting in a way. This girl's confused about everything.

571
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:43,899
So always pay attention to your monster's energy level as you proceed with your adventure. Come

572
01:56:43,899 --> 01:56:48,949
back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points. Wait, let me read this again.

573
01:56:48,949 --> 01:56:56,789
Come back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points hits minus 10. What's that

574
01:56:56,789 --> 01:57:07,319
telling me? What's that telling me? If you don't, the monster's lifespan will be shortened. Just

575
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:18,060
don't let it hit minus 10. Okay, let's take off. Where do we go? Do I have to do this? Which way

576
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:37,289
should I go? This seems very important. Go north? How do I move? Whoa. Whoa. All right.

577
01:57:37,289 --> 01:57:58,789
Keep going? Where the fuck am I? The path is blocked and we can't go any further.

578
01:57:58,789 --> 01:58:07,960
Do you want Cosmic Calamity to move the obstacle? Yes. Nice. Okay, you're great. Change the camera.

579
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:30,939
Where should I go? Up to the volcano? We're down. Up to the volcano. We can't go any further.

580
01:58:30,939 --> 01:58:44,649
Move that. All right. Into the volcano? There's nowhere else I can go. Oh, there is an entrance

581
01:58:44,729 --> 01:58:53,670
here. I smell something in the cave. What do you smell? I don't mean that kind of smell.

582
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:58,260
I feel something related to disk stones. Or how can I say? I have a feeling that

583
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:05,140
monster's legend may be buried in here. Really? They usually say women's intuition,

584
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:19,800
but I guess we should call it doctor's intuition this time. Well, shall we investigate it? Yes.

585
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:31,819
Now what? What's that sound? Does it destroy the volcano? What is that thing and how do I get it?

586
01:59:31,819 --> 01:59:34,939
I want it right now and I want to use it. It's the next monster we're going to use. I want it right

587
01:59:34,939 --> 01:59:51,659
now. Oh, isn't that the legendary monster Phoenix, the guardian deity of the mountain?

588
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:58,359
It's not just a legend. It's real and it's alive. I better let him know about it as soon as possible.

589
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:04,840
Oh, who are you going to tell about it? Huh? Oh, never mind. Anyway, it seems like this is

590
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:11,479
not the place I'm looking for. I wonder where that shrine of gods is. By the way, I wonder if

591
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:21,899
Cosmic Calamity is all right. So shall we investigate inside again? Yeah. What is this?

592
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:32,180
That seems pretty far away to me. I just got something. I picked up something. I got

593
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:38,520
something. A fucking bunch of bananas. No, come go back in. Go back in right now. Go back in.

594
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:53,460
Get it at the top. Nice. Okay, that's definitely it. Get something else too. Fire feather left by

595
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:59,100
the legendary monster. If we investigate, we might be able to unravel the unknown secrets of the

596
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:14,729
Phoenix. Should I keep going? Do I just pull them out? Leave or are you going to hit minus 10? Okay.

597
02:01:14,729 --> 02:01:19,109
All right. I don't need anything else from in here. I'm actually really excited. I've never seen

598
02:01:19,109 --> 02:01:29,210
this before. All right. Let's pull it out. All right. Let's go. I just leave. Pull them out and

599
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:41,270
check the HP. I have 65. Should I do it again? Remember, go mix something random with that and

600
02:01:41,270 --> 02:02:02,140
you'll get the Phoenix. Are you serious? One more? One more. Come on. No, you idiot. All right. Get

601
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:18,409
up. You're supposed to have 700 intelligence. I can do it again. One more. There it is. What do you

602
02:02:18,409 --> 02:02:33,609
got? Oh, what did you get? I got a... No, get out. Now I just leave? If I go straight down,

603
02:02:33,609 --> 02:02:52,630
will that take me back? I have to go back to the entrance. I can't go down. Yeah, I can't go down.

604
02:02:52,630 --> 02:03:13,289
I have to go all the way around. I can't go down. I'm okay. 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10,

605
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:30,170
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh, I made it. I made it. He's fine. All right. What did we get? We got

606
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:42,279
a magic banana, a fire feather, and disc chips. It was quite meaningful. Go back home. Hell yeah.

607
02:03:42,279 --> 02:03:47,289
Did you tell me I'm going to get to be able to make a Phoenix and then combine it with a weird

608
02:03:47,289 --> 02:04:04,409
plant monster and make a plant Phoenix? That was a good adventure. All right. We're going to go with

609
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:19,689
tablets again. What do we do now? Should I just make a Phoenix? After you create a Phoenix by

610
02:04:19,689 --> 02:04:32,170
combining, you get infinite more from music tracks. Can Phoenix be combined with stuff?

611
02:04:32,729 --> 02:04:50,539
Can I make like a cosmic Phoenix? Phoenix can't be combined, but I can pull a Phoenix.

612
02:04:53,670 --> 02:05:02,250
So I can pull a different kind of Phoenix. Phoenix is only Phoenix or Phoenix plus Phoenix.

613
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:18,140
Save the game? I will. There's only three Phoenix types. Okay. Let's go make one.

614
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:55,779
So let's freeze you. But now what do I do here? Can I do this wrong? I can do this wrong?

615
02:05:56,659 --> 02:06:07,109
Oh God. I hope I get it right. Whatever it is. Saved. I did. Get two monsters from the market.

616
02:06:07,109 --> 02:06:10,470
Combine two monsters and just use the feather. This is impossible to fuck it up.

617
02:06:11,029 --> 02:06:24,619
Just combine two. All right. Who are we going to sacrifice here? All right. Who are we sacrificing?

618
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:43,319
Xbox Series X and Noodle? Batman. Does it matter? Well, the stats are still transferred,

619
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:48,500
so a high int monster will give good. Oh, okay. Should I do calamity? Should we just say,

620
02:06:48,500 --> 02:07:00,789
fuck it and let's go? Bug Batman has high stats. All right. I need, I need a lore master to tell

621
02:07:00,789 --> 02:07:07,819
me this. If it, if any combination with the feather gets a Phoenix, does it act? If I combine Bug

622
02:07:07,819 --> 02:07:13,819
Batman and cosmic calamity and the feather, is the Phoenix going to have really like crazy base

623
02:07:13,819 --> 02:07:23,060
stats? I need a lore master to help me here. Dude. Combination is such a fucked up math problem.

624
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:33,020
I can't explain it in chat, dude. Stats will not be transferred for Phoenix. It's a unique summon.

625
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:38,460
Okay. Combining is extraordinarily complicated. All right. All right.

626
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:45,850
So it just doesn't matter. So we're just going to do two people that we don't really care about.

627
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:49,529
I care about Wellington. I don't care about the Xbox Series X. Who cares?

628
02:07:53,590 --> 02:08:01,020
And Noodle, I don't really care either. Wellington and Bonnie, I think it'd be used pretty well.

629
02:08:06,539 --> 02:08:18,020
Secret item. Where is it? There it is. Let's go. Let's do it. This one's all up to you.

630
02:08:18,579 --> 02:08:29,420
Phoenix. Yeah. Phoenix sucks at power, has insane int and the rest is average.

631
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:34,300
You'll need to errantry for the int move again, but it only has one non-int move it can learn.

632
02:08:35,020 --> 02:09:04,460
Ready to face game for this one? All right. Whoa. 170 base health, 190 int. Oh my God.

633
02:09:09,689 --> 02:09:17,300
Phoenix is the one we saw at the volcano. Well, take good care of it. You have to give it a name.

634
02:09:19,659 --> 02:09:31,270
A phoenix familiar. Red wizard has got phoenix familiar. Blue wizard is about to die. Red wizard

635
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:54,939
needs food battery. Oh, it's definitely familiar. It'll be called familiar. Let's go familiar.

636
02:09:55,579 --> 02:10:20,760
That's lame. Familiar. Name it phoenix right. No. Long chicken. That is a boring one. All right.

637
02:10:21,079 --> 02:10:33,939
Yeah, it's boring. Familiar. That's fucking boring. BKLC? BKLC. Burger King Long Chicken.

638
02:10:33,939 --> 02:11:06,739
Now it's name is BKLC. Shit. It should have been spicy. BKLC. All right. Cool. Wow. I have a

639
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:22,869
phoenix. This is cool. All right. So I need to make... Excuse me. Hello. Loremaster of Monster

640
02:11:22,869 --> 02:11:29,500
Rancher 2 in the chat please. Phoenix. All the monsters have different times where they peak.

641
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:35,529
What does the phoenixes look like? Is it early? Is it late? Should I? Because I want to train this

642
02:11:35,529 --> 02:11:46,199
one correct. At the Britney Spears toxic monster. I can look it up. Oh yeah. I can just look it up

643
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:57,739
myself. Right. All right. Game stuff. Game guides. Okay. Monster Rancher 2. Looking for

644
02:11:57,739 --> 02:12:06,260
monster battle specials. Monster data. Here we go. Monster breed. Phoenix. Phoenix.

645
02:12:13,609 --> 02:12:19,210
Base stats. Stat gains. So it looks like it gains crazy intelligence. But everything else

646
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:32,460
is pretty bad. Okay. You can eat like an iceberg? What? All right. There's an iceberg and there's

647
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:49,529
like a dark bird. How do I get these? Spoilers. What do you mean spoilers? The lifespan is only

648
02:12:49,529 --> 02:13:02,460
350 weeks. If you want to train him well, you're going to need like $15,000 a year. Okay.

649
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:11,430
So we're doing heavy intelligence. And what's a heavy intelligence skill? Like build it like the

650
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:21,300
wall? Look up. Look. Okay. Well, let, let, let, yeah. Let's take a look. I'm very curious. Let's

651
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:31,270
freeze you for a second. Can I unlock a different phoenix now? One build Andy. Can we freeze him?

652
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:56,199
It's painful. Okay. Shrine. Fiskstone. All right. What am I looking for? Toxic by Britney Spears.

653
02:13:57,159 --> 02:14:18,470
Can I actually do this yet? No, it's a rare monster. Okay. Look up. Well, white snake.

654
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:52,819
This one was rare. Oh, it's the band. Okay. All right. What am I looking for? Do highway to hell.

655
02:14:53,460 --> 02:15:19,420
I will snake bite. Where's snake bite? Oh, okay. Let's go. I want, I, what if I want another one?

656
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:27,020
Dude, this, okay. All right. All right. All right. Look at this. Look at this thing. So this is a

657
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:43,109
unique monster. Oh, no way. 229. What's the difference? But wait, there's probably a

658
02:15:43,109 --> 02:16:03,989
difference though. So there's a phoenix and then cinderbird. Okay. Let me check. Stat gains are

659
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:15,270
CEACCC. I think it's the same as the phoenix. What's the difference though? Besides the base

660
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:24,840
stats. Yeah. Same exact stat gains. That's right. 14 movement speed. Same exact thing. Base nature

661
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:33,100
90. Base nature 90. Cinderbird is enemy only and it's only available in this version.

662
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:38,260
It has 20 more weeks of lifespan. Is that it? It's just a better phoenix. That's the only

663
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:51,110
difference. It's just a better one. Okay. It gets extra tech. All right. Very cool. All right. We're

664
02:16:51,110 --> 02:17:20,299
definitely using this one. Burnt BKLC. I had to use a space. I don't think I can. I don't think

665
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:33,860
there is a space. If the phoenix is on fire, this one's like cinder. This one's kind of like burnt

666
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:57,770
out. Smolder. Smolder. Smolder? No, I'm not going to name this character burnt fucker. Okay. You

667
02:17:57,770 --> 02:18:26,250
did that in your game. Smoke? No. Charcoal. Brickette. Brickette. All right. Smolderloin?

668
02:18:26,889 --> 02:19:08,899
I like Brickette. How do you spell this? Brickette BK. How about BK Brickette? Somebody just called

669
02:19:08,899 --> 02:19:27,100
me a knob. I'm going to keep Brickette. That's not iconic like Beanbag Sonic. I like BK Brickette.

670
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:38,299
Smolder. No, the name doesn't matter. I make garbage names anyways. Brickette is with an E.

671
02:19:39,020 --> 02:20:14,090
How about Brickette? Brickette. All right. I got to pick one. Briskette. Oh, now I got it. Briskette.

672
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:46,889
Briskette. Like that. Get rid of the E. Get rid of the U. Briskette. There you go. Briskette. Done.

673
02:20:46,889 --> 02:21:13,899
It's with a Q. I'm seriously, I got to fucking move on. There it is. Briskette. Briskette. Got it.

674
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:20,420
All right. Now let's just look for some more. Why not? What if I combine? You can't combine

675
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:33,979
phoenixes, right? Let me look up a few more. Because there's other monsters to get. You can

676
02:21:33,979 --> 02:21:40,299
combine two phoenixes. All right. Let me look up a couple songs that I want to look up. We lit

677
02:21:40,299 --> 02:22:06,100
SpongeBob. I can't get SpongeBob. Give me Neutron. Metal Gear. Oh, Beanbag Sonic. That's right. We

678
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:44,250
could get Beanbag Sonic. Although, come on. Okay. Hip to be square. I like it. Wait, what? Where is

679
02:22:44,250 --> 02:23:05,180
it? What? I won't picture this. How about just Huey Lewis in the news? Huey Lewis in the news.

680
02:23:05,899 --> 02:23:31,299
Four? Wait. What do you mean four? Do a random one? Random. Nova the album. Okay. Well, Nova the

681
02:23:31,299 --> 02:24:02,170
album. Ooh. Suizo. Hey, look at this little guy. That's not bad. But I don't want you. How about

682
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:21,670
like DuckTales? DuckTales theme. Metal version. Maybe it's a duck. I'm not doing another wall.

683
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:40,120
Sorry. And those stats are dog shit. So no, not happening. Meatloaf. Oh shit. All right. How about

684
02:24:40,120 --> 02:25:06,040
Meatloaf? How about Bad Out of Hell 2? Back into Hell. Uh, we already have one of these.

685
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:26,500
I wasn't too big of a fan. Stats are actually kind of good. 157, 157. I might actually hold on to

686
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:56,260
this one. Who's purple in the Batman universe? Joker? Nah. But I'm only going to use this for

687
02:25:56,260 --> 02:26:03,579
a combination, I think. Whatever. Who cares? Lowercase doesn't matter. It's Joker. Goodbye.

688
02:26:04,139 --> 02:26:11,079
I don't want to run out of space either, though. All right. What else do you want?

689
02:26:11,719 --> 02:26:26,329
You know the monsters before you take the, uh, Cinderbird? Okay. What do we got?

690
02:26:26,329 --> 02:26:36,899
You have 20 freezing slots. Okay. Uh, Gangnam Style. I don't think that would be on here.

691
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:55,860
Find out, though. It is on here. Which version? Which version? No, not that one. This one. Rare.

692
02:26:55,860 --> 02:27:31,110
Got the other one? Am I spelling it wrong? Wait, what's happening? Wait, what am I doing? Okay.

693
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:56,170
Here we go. This one works. Ooh, one of the dogs. Cool looking. I like the speed. I don't like

694
02:27:56,170 --> 02:28:29,000
anything else. Sandstorm? Imagine Dragons. Not here. The Rude? No, that, okay. I'm an idiot.

695
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:38,700
The Rude is the artist. Sandstorm the remixes. Or, let's just do regular Sandstorm. Rare.

696
02:28:38,700 --> 02:29:08,440
Try the remix. Um, okay. Definitely this one. Yeah, this one. Really? Come on.

697
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:14,709
Tenacious D. All right, what's the one that's...

698
02:29:19,989 --> 02:29:40,569
It was the... What's that one called? Seinfeld. Seinfeld. Yeah, it's called Tribute. All right,

699
02:29:40,569 --> 02:29:55,079
where is it? Tenacious D. Ozzy Osborn? How about the Funk Hunters? I like that. Tenacious D,

700
02:29:55,079 --> 02:30:09,959
Tenacious D, Tenacious D. Where is it? It's not even here. Whatever, what's going on with

701
02:30:09,959 --> 02:30:45,290
the Funk Hunters? Ooh, a water monster? Strong looking, really. Looks dependable. So it's a

702
02:30:45,290 --> 02:31:00,940
dinosaur jelly? Water Raptor? This is not bad. It's kind of all around not bad. It's a chaos.

703
02:31:05,530 --> 02:31:23,639
Um, that's cool, but I don't know if I want it. No thanks. Uh, BBS is Death of a Bachelor by

704
02:31:23,639 --> 02:31:52,379
Panic at the Disco. Here we go. Time to bring him back from beyond the grave. Beanbag Sonic.

705
02:31:52,379 --> 02:32:01,530
I love Beanbag Sonic. Speed is so... Beanbag Sonic is unironically very, very good.

706
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:31,540
Base health and the base speed are very, very good. We're going to keep... Beanbag Sonic is back.

707
02:32:31,540 --> 02:33:01,420
Freeze. You know what I really want to find? I want to find one of those apes. 64 intelligence.

708
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:07,610
All right, all right. It's time to move on. I want to try to get one or two more decent ones.

709
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:43,110
Do Baby Metal's album? Baby Metal? It's Baby Metal. Baby Metal? Baby Metal. Jelly. The jelly

710
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:54,659
monster? Is it just jelly jelly? I think it is. How would you ever use this? What? One, two, three,

711
02:33:54,659 --> 02:34:22,219
four, five, six. These stats are awful. It's just a meme? Oh, okay. What about hamster dance? Hamster

712
02:34:22,219 --> 02:34:32,139
dance. Did I spell it wrong? Hamster dance? Is it two words? Hamster dance. The hamsters.

713
02:34:32,700 --> 02:35:01,989
Rare. Jim Carrey? What do you mean Jim Carrey? Jim Carrey pecan pie? What is this? I've never

714
02:35:01,989 --> 02:35:10,280
heard of this. Oh, it's an ape. It's an ape. It's actually an ape. All right. Awesome.

715
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:33,739
What kind of ape is this? Oh, that's not bad. Yes, I want it. Okay. Now, what if we combine the ape

716
02:35:34,620 --> 02:36:07,190
and somebody else? Ape Ventura. Ape Ventura. I like Ape Ventura. That's a good one.

717
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:22,600
Combine the ape with the monolith. Okay. Let's freeze. Let's do a little bit of work here.

718
02:36:23,319 --> 02:36:28,229
Wait. I want to see what kind of monster this is. Wait. I got to look at techniques and shit. Hold

719
02:36:28,229 --> 02:36:45,059
on. Ato. Let's see. Okay. Likes jelly. Doesn't like milk. Nature is bad natured. What's the...

720
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:56,649
What kind of monster is this? I see the sub monster. This is an ape and something else. Or

721
02:36:56,649 --> 02:37:11,670
is it just ape? It's just ape. It's ape ape. Oh, okay. So if I combine this, I should look

722
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:19,780
for something to do with it. It's just pure ape. Okay. Let's do some combining. I have disc chips

723
02:37:19,780 --> 02:37:36,680
too. The ape does not have very many subspecies. Okay. Wait, let me save it. I've been doing a lot

724
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:56,700
of stuff. Let's make sure I don't lose it. There we go. Very cool. Okay. What can we get? Ape. Okay.

725
02:37:56,700 --> 02:38:00,139
We've got Burger King, Long Chicken. We can't combine this though. This is Phoenix.

726
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:14,739
Brisket. Wellington. Ooh. What about ape Wellington? That might be kind of good. Or

727
02:38:18,389 --> 02:38:41,559
ape, um, ape Bonnie. No, stop. Stop it. Why not? I think I want to try it. Let's try it. Ape and

728
02:38:41,879 --> 02:38:59,450
Wellington. Yes. And we'll use some seasoning. Uh, hair? Hono mochi. Ape disc. Should I put an ape disc?

729
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:20,969
What would that do? Oh, not with Wellington. Stop it. I don't, why? Crossbacteria is unsure.

730
02:39:20,969 --> 02:39:30,010
Oh, we're just going to get it. Wait, what? We're going to combine these two and it's just going to

731
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:57,610
pop out one of the two? Ape, ape and dog Batman? Bonnie, we'll use, uh, ape disc. This one's up to

732
02:39:57,610 --> 02:40:09,079
you. Okay. No, no, not anything interesting. Not going to get anything weird. Try it again. Ape

733
02:40:09,719 --> 02:40:38,170
and beanbag Sonic. We're going to call this Robotnik by the way. Ape disc. This one's all up to you.

734
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:52,889
What's a Gaboo? Oh, it's already what this is. No shit. Sonic is a Gaboo. Okay.

735
02:40:53,610 --> 02:41:09,770
No, I want a different ape. The ape disc is messing it up. Just don't use the ape disc.

736
02:41:09,770 --> 02:41:19,770
All right. What about ape and, uh, don't use the disc. Ape and beanbag Sonic, no disc.

737
02:41:23,829 --> 02:41:29,719
Let's see what happens with this shit. I'm curious. We'll do a secret seasoning of,

738
02:41:29,719 --> 02:41:48,809
uh, hair's disc. Let's go. This combination sucks. And then we'll do,

739
02:41:49,770 --> 02:42:00,489
this is the only one we haven't really tried. And no seasoning. What the fuck? All right. Fuck it.

740
02:42:00,489 --> 02:42:14,969
Let's go. This is just for stats. Oh, okay. All right. I'm ready. What are we pulling out?

741
02:42:14,969 --> 02:42:24,149
I think I have to pull the wall out. Yeah. We're doing cosmic calamity. We're so close.

742
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:46,969
Brisket. Cosmic. Should we do brisket? I need money though. No, not yet. I need money. I,

743
02:42:46,969 --> 02:42:53,270
I need to make another like 10 to 20,000 dollars. Take out bug Batman and let him die.

744
02:42:54,069 --> 02:43:09,180
Oh, that's right. Okay. Good idea. We're just gonna, we're gonna make money with bug Batman

745
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:28,889
until he dies. It's going to be very sad. Everybody say goodbye. We're going to get some money

746
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:37,209
out of bug Batman. Kind of a cool monster, but a really, really awful name. Not funny. Just sucked.

747
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:47,190
But rest up. The next battle is, uh, we need to do C, right? 3,000 bucks.

748
02:43:47,829 --> 02:44:01,799
Get some rest. Uh, how come I'm so cruel? Because when a monster dies, you unlock another breed.

749
02:44:03,770 --> 02:44:15,459
So somebody has to die. Uh, C I would say just to make sure I can make the money.

750
02:44:15,459 --> 02:44:40,819
There's a lot of fusions with this guy. Somebody has to die though. I got the cinder phoenix.

751
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:58,389
That's going to be the S tier monster. Bug Batman style is doting. Yeah. Cause I spoiled this shit

752
02:44:58,389 --> 02:45:21,860
out of him. It's the first monster we used. I forgot. It's not just one hit Andy. Are we trying

753
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:29,340
to kill bug Batman? We're not trying to kill bug Batman. Bug Batman is about to farm money

754
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:35,479
and hopefully get to somewhere around 30 to $40,000. We will put bug Batman to rest.

755
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:42,760
He will have done his job. Well, Batman seems to not be able to hit anything.

756
02:45:50,010 --> 02:46:09,989
Oh, I'm in trouble here. I have to swing. I'm dead. I forgot how much this guy sucks.

757
02:46:13,459 --> 02:46:35,049
The other high level cup today gives 10 K. It does. It's too late. I could just say,

758
02:46:35,049 --> 02:47:01,110
yeah, I load the same. Yeah. I know. Fuck this. I give up. Yeah. I forget that it's 10 grand.

759
02:47:01,110 --> 02:47:12,149
There's no way I'm not doing it. The game kind of glitches out a little bit sometimes. All right.

760
02:47:12,149 --> 02:47:24,540
Let's go use the monster rancher. One disc. The thing dies in one day. Is the one that's 10 grand.

761
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:32,569
It's a 10 grand. What are you talking about? 10 grand. Where do you see 10 grand?

762
02:47:32,569 --> 02:47:50,649
There's no 10 grand. None of these are 10 grand. Pure gold. Oh, this is pure silver.

763
02:47:57,579 --> 02:48:37,750
Oh, oh, oh. You sell the gold. I got you. Let's feed you some soil. Clean this up.

764
02:48:37,750 --> 02:48:52,420
I need to do that air entry and get this stupid move. All right. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,

765
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:57,540
hurry. Farm, farm, farm, farm, farm. Instant kill. One, two, three. One, two, three. Dead.

766
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:27,989
Very nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Money. Get some money. Let's go. Watch out. He has psychic scream.

767
02:49:27,989 --> 02:49:38,649
Just use the speed function. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. How do I do it?

768
02:49:39,209 --> 02:49:51,780
I think I can enable it from here. It's FF. What does FF stand for?

769
02:49:53,260 --> 02:50:12,420
Fast fighting. Fast forward. Oh, shit. You're right. Okay. Okay. This is like too fast.

770
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:29,770
It's actually just times two speed. I thought this hurts my head. Gold bar.

771
02:50:30,329 --> 02:50:44,540
Can the gold be used for anything else? Nice. Sure. You're going to have polish.

772
02:50:44,540 --> 02:51:04,090
It makes gold suazo 1% less stressed. That's so stupid. It feels like it's in slow motion now.

773
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:15,319
I'm not doing that again. It's fucking my brain up. All right. I got almost seven.

774
02:51:15,319 --> 02:51:28,340
So I need 17,000 by what date? How did you get this much money? I'm struggling to get money in

775
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:33,639
the game. It actually takes a little while because your first couple of monsters are going to be

776
02:51:33,639 --> 02:51:38,700
kind of dumpy and you're going to be spending a lot of money just keeping them alive and trying

777
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:46,149
to win shitty tournaments. But once you get the one person that can reliably do C and B tournaments

778
02:51:47,459 --> 02:51:54,569
and you can just kind of make money with that character. So it takes a little while. The first

779
02:51:55,129 --> 02:52:00,120
six to 10 hours of the game, actual in-game gameplay. I'm not sure if you're like a

780
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:03,799
veteran of the game and you know exactly what to do, but if you're just starting, it could be

781
02:52:03,799 --> 02:52:09,610
a little bit of a curve, especially the training regimens. They're kind of confusing.

782
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:19,750
All right. When's the next battle? One here. I'll do that one too. So let's do, I want to do an

783
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:32,700
errand tree. Uh, lore masters. When do, when do I need $15,000 by, when do I have to have at least

784
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:53,989
15 by July 4th? So literally tomorrow. I need 17,000. It's August 8th. Sell something.

785
02:53:01,370 --> 02:53:08,090
All right. Is it actually, do I really need to have $17,000? It's May 4th next year, not July.

786
02:53:08,090 --> 02:53:22,780
Okay. So I have to wait a year. That's fine. So in the meantime, I'm just, I'm going to do an

787
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:33,319
errand tree. I have to, I can't just wait for the dumb sale. This guy needs shit. So if I do an

788
02:53:33,319 --> 02:53:53,370
errand tree now, I will be able to rest. Okay. Let's go do an errand tree. What do I get the,

789
02:53:53,370 --> 02:54:09,299
uh, the move I want monster is higher than B rank and you can use any location you want.

790
02:54:09,299 --> 02:54:32,379
Oh, okay. You need to do Korea. This is the place I unlocked Mandy. What's the one to get the,

791
02:54:32,379 --> 02:54:47,340
the a Korea seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique here. I want Ray. Okay.

792
02:54:47,340 --> 02:54:51,829
Let's go for it. Yeah. Let's fight a monster too. One of these,

793
02:54:52,549 --> 02:55:09,290
you can definitely do at least a C. Oh, unicorn bean bag, Sonic, Harry, Harry. Who could I? Whoa.

794
02:55:11,159 --> 02:55:50,329
Magma heart. We go for Terry. How about one-eyed? Let's go. Good. Nice. I got it. All right. So I

795
02:55:50,329 --> 02:56:08,899
think I got Ray crash bandicoot music. It kind of is. Or an actor. Please turn an OST on and

796
02:56:08,899 --> 02:56:22,299
turn the in-game music off. We're dying. I, that's not unanimous. I think I'm not failing this. This

797
02:56:22,299 --> 02:56:53,930
is defense training. All right. All right. That's good. So bean bag, Sonic's organs. Holy s**t.

798
02:56:53,930 --> 02:57:23,690
That looks all right. Please no more clown music. I would like 200 health. I ran a sword. I get one

799
02:57:23,690 --> 02:58:03,479
of those s**t. Come on, get up. Oh, I got saved by the, nevermind. Get him, get him and then fight

800
02:58:03,479 --> 02:58:16,329
Terry, whatever his name was. Yeah, that's it. I win. Now we get to fight that weird monster at the

801
02:58:16,329 --> 02:58:33,479
end. How was that? Like 20 defense? That was pretty significant. Goldy. I should win as long as he

802
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:39,879
does an intelligence move and isn't an idiot and just bumps him a thousand times. Let's see. Oh,

803
02:58:39,879 --> 02:58:52,010
that was okay. Got him. I should have went for one of the B monsters or even one of the A ones

804
02:58:52,010 --> 02:59:12,100
probably. Great job. Easy battle to win against those guys. Let's go back. Good job. What do you

805
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:18,760
actually get for beating the monster at the end? Prize money? Oh, it just lets you get it. Okay.

806
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:38,040
Yeah. I remember you get half back. Nice job. Pretty tired. All right. What's that technique?

807
02:59:46,569 --> 02:59:59,209
Ray. Okay. This is force. So it's hit B. These are all hit C. Okay. At least I'll be able to

808
02:59:59,209 --> 03:00:08,899
actually do s**t. Withering is B on this as well, which is guts removal, but that's really good.

809
03:00:12,149 --> 03:00:17,750
Whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a huge amount of guts to use.

810
03:00:19,459 --> 03:00:32,059
35 guts? The monster has 700 intelligence. He probably is smarter than any human that has

811
03:00:32,059 --> 03:00:37,260
ever existed. Yet you force it to fight instead of letting it learn a language and contribute to

812
03:00:37,260 --> 03:01:09,930
humanity. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's fine. We need some anti-stress and rest. It also greatly reduces

813
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:17,299
the enemy's guts. That's true. Maybe I should start with that or maybe that's like an oh s**t

814
03:01:17,299 --> 03:01:21,219
button. If I miss the first one, just get in close and try to take their guts away so I can stall.

815
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:56,340
Need to buy. Oh, overweight. Keep game OST or play something else.

816
03:01:56,340 --> 03:02:10,149
Sorry guys. That's democracy. The next battle is coming up here and it's three grand and then I

817
03:02:10,149 --> 03:02:17,450
could try A again. All right. We're going for this one. This one here. So we'll rest up. No,

818
03:02:17,450 --> 03:02:22,020
we need to do some training, right? Let's do another air entry. F**k it. Let's do another one

819
03:02:22,020 --> 03:02:44,760
after this tournament, right? No, just double rest, triple rest. I want to see the Phoenix.

820
03:02:46,149 --> 03:02:49,829
I know everybody wants to see the Phoenix. I do too, but I need to make enough money

821
03:02:49,829 --> 03:02:57,559
first because the Phoenix is E rank. I got to get to like 20 plus thousand dollars. Once that

822
03:02:57,559 --> 03:03:03,909
happens, I can comfortably bring out the Phoenix and train the absolute hell out of it with buying

823
03:03:03,909 --> 03:03:18,870
all these products, doing the air entries. Air entry. All right. Nice. Okay. All right. All

824
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:26,149
right. All right. I can learn. Where's the other move? Cosmic limit doesn't look very good these

825
03:03:26,149 --> 03:04:02,469
days. What? I'm going for A. I'm going for it. Save the game. I guess I f**k up. He's got one last

826
03:04:02,469 --> 03:04:23,770
fight. He's got more than that. Probably another year. Let's go for it. Four grand. All right.

827
03:04:23,770 --> 03:04:33,219
Something else to keep in mind. Your no rest schedule you're doing does not work in the new

828
03:04:33,219 --> 03:04:38,899
game. It reduces lifespan quite a bit now. The new one is harder and RNG based because of magic

829
03:04:38,899 --> 03:05:04,549
bananas. Really? Really? Oh, okay. Well, magic bananas in this economy. I got confidence we can

830
03:05:04,549 --> 03:05:16,489
land at least one hit here. 60% get it. I f**king am spamming. Spam it. All right. Now get in close

831
03:05:16,489 --> 03:05:22,569
and make the guaranteed hit. Get in close. Get in close. It's big. It's bigger hit. Get in close.

832
03:05:23,450 --> 03:05:42,860
Thank you. 200 and what? Excuse me? Did that much damage? That was insane.

833
03:05:43,879 --> 03:06:01,430
Did I just do that? No rest method still does work. That's definitely the play is you go for

834
03:06:01,430 --> 03:06:05,190
the coin flip. If you miss you just get in close and you'll do some withering. That's a lot of

835
03:06:05,190 --> 03:06:14,540
power. This thing is awesome. What is this whale? It's a bipedal whale. All right. Get in close

836
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:36,700
and go. Hell yeah. Okay. Just actually stay in close and do it again. Should I go back? Stay in

837
03:06:36,700 --> 03:06:49,190
close. Get the guaranteed hit. No. 66%. Give me a break. What the f**k? Heck. 66%. You know,

838
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:57,350
you can't even land that and you die. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Back. Back. Back. Back.

839
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:04,420
Holy s**t. I actually pulled it off. No, I didn't. God damn it. He has got grit too. Just push him.

840
03:07:04,420 --> 03:07:10,469
Just bump into him. Bump into him. How much does he hate? Bump him. Bump him. Bump him. Bump him.

841
03:07:10,469 --> 03:07:26,459
Get in close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Bump him. Who wins? I won? Wait. What? Oh, because I had a

842
03:07:26,459 --> 03:07:34,649
high... Wait. I don't understand. Doesn't he have higher... Because my health is lower. So my max

843
03:07:34,649 --> 03:07:42,579
health... Okay. I'll take it. How come I censored myself? Because I promised my mother I would say

844
03:07:42,579 --> 03:08:01,659
less swear words. That was crazy. Am I going to win my first A Cup? Find out. It's going to be

845
03:08:01,659 --> 03:08:47,799
tricky. I have to get a big crit here. Oh, that's it. I'm still in it. What? Injured? 2,500? Reload the

846
03:08:47,799 --> 03:08:59,979
save? Uh, yes. I think Cosmic Calamity is injured. It's not serious, but I'll put it in the hospital

847
03:08:59,979 --> 03:09:29,260
for fast recovery. It's still in the hospital. Hope it will come back soon. He's fine. All right. Check

848
03:09:29,260 --> 03:10:01,780
his hate. Hate? Loyalty went down. It's okay. It takes a ton of its life away. Um, wait. I should

849
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:23,559
have done the V... I'm reloading the save. Uh, we need a little bit of light training. Why not?

850
03:10:23,559 --> 03:10:40,809
How about a little bit of dodging? Whatever. Cheating? All right. I promise I will not save

851
03:10:40,809 --> 03:11:00,299
scum the bird. Save scumming is pretty much required for this game. Yeah, there's a lot of

852
03:11:00,299 --> 03:11:17,479
heavy RNG. Heavy RNG. Let's make some money. He dislikes tablets, Jeremiah. Yeah. Well,

853
03:11:17,479 --> 03:11:22,860
here's the thing, though. Uh, according to the experts, it doesn't matter if they don't like

854
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:30,389
tablets. It's still the best food to feed anyone, even if they don't like it. What I've been told.

855
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:49,770
Hey, pill boys, thanks for the 10. You know what I mean? Community stuff. What's your opinion on the...

856
03:11:49,770 --> 03:11:55,020
Hold on. What's your opinion on the... What's your opinion on the socio-economic climate

857
03:11:55,020 --> 03:12:09,479
of Sugandhi's nuts? Um, I've already said the joke for you. I get to make it. You don't. Wait,

858
03:12:09,479 --> 03:12:17,340
you backed out? He forfeited. That's how you know I'm not supposed to be here.

859
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:47,670
You couldn't have put less effort into that. After this, we're going to try... We're going to do

860
03:12:47,670 --> 03:12:51,750
another air entry. We'll get double beam because that's like the culmination of this whole thing.

861
03:12:52,940 --> 03:13:01,670
Double beam, try to just RNG ourselves through A rank, and then either let him die or put him on

862
03:13:01,670 --> 03:13:22,979
ice. All right. It's the biggest crit we've done so far. 517. All I'm doing now is I'm trying to go

863
03:13:22,979 --> 03:13:42,729
for, you know, long distance home run records. I want to hit like a 600 foot home run. Slow down

864
03:13:42,729 --> 03:13:48,250
so we can gamble. I don't think gambling right now is a good idea considering I'm almost guaranteed

865
03:13:48,250 --> 03:14:18,329
to win every single B rank match. What's this item? Manselton? What is that? Nice. Wow. Okay.

866
03:14:18,969 --> 03:14:21,559
All right. You're almost ready to actually get us to S.

867
03:14:25,399 --> 03:14:41,670
Get that double beam. Paul is sure you deserve it. Life go up, fame go down. Yeah, that's all good.

868
03:14:46,170 --> 03:14:50,020
All right. We're looking... This is the one right here. This is the official cup.

869
03:14:51,770 --> 03:15:06,040
Can I get through this? Heavy. Okay. If you go to the heavy air entry before August

870
03:15:06,920 --> 03:15:14,469
and you succeed with no injury, you'll be able to unlock Centaur. If you'd rather that than double

871
03:15:14,469 --> 03:15:36,819
beam. Hmm. Well, August is already over. I don't know. Let's go for double beam. Cosmic's going to

872
03:15:36,819 --> 03:15:44,090
die soon anyways. Yeah, but I kind of want to see a huge number through Chad's go straight for S

873
03:15:44,090 --> 03:15:56,309
rank. I'm going to try. Rest up before the... Let's try it again. I have to at least get to S.

874
03:15:56,870 --> 03:16:29,370
Look at your view count. 13,703. What about it? Big number. He didn't get the joke. Oh, I don't

875
03:16:29,370 --> 03:16:39,139
get the joke. I don't understand. Who cares? I don't care. I thought I was supposed to get

876
03:16:39,139 --> 03:16:50,389
something. What am I missing? All right. Come on. We can just luck Andy these people. Save the game.

877
03:16:50,950 --> 03:17:00,860
Official A rank. Get in there. Feed some items and shit so you're happier. Stress banana. Whatever

878
03:17:00,860 --> 03:17:07,000
this is. You wanted to see a big number. Oh, oh, that's not, that was not like a joke. That was

879
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:16,180
like nice. I can't believe there are this many people here. Hope you're having a good time. I

880
03:17:16,180 --> 03:17:23,459
love this game. I think it's fun. I think it's worth buying. Thanks for watching. Hi, everybody.

881
03:17:23,459 --> 03:17:42,020
All right. It's time to save. Sounds good. Battle time. If I got lucky once, I can get lucky twice.

882
03:17:42,020 --> 03:17:46,260
And if I can get lucky twice, I can get lucky five times. If I can get lucky five times,

883
03:17:46,899 --> 03:17:55,770
then I just have to hope I place. I have that new move, so I didn't have that last time I tried to

884
03:17:55,770 --> 03:18:04,329
the official cup. The only one I'm actually afraid of is the one that is that go trick.

885
03:18:04,969 --> 03:18:23,610
Let's go. This is it. I land the first hit. You're dead. You got to hit. Go before me. Not here.

886
03:18:25,340 --> 03:18:43,959
And go. Just have to do that a few more times. Finally get to S rank. Although this did happen

887
03:18:43,959 --> 03:18:51,000
last time. The best part about this, though, is that Dragon is not here anymore. I think the

888
03:18:51,000 --> 03:19:09,700
Dragon got promoted to S rank. They're not here. We're here the last two times. This is a big

889
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:17,510
tournament. All the major tournaments are eight. All right. Lamb sweet. This person beat the shit

890
03:19:17,510 --> 03:19:27,129
out of us last time. All about it's the speed. It's just the fact that I have a plan and I think

891
03:19:27,129 --> 03:19:33,979
it was going to go forward. Was it 30%? I have to go for it. It's going to be a shit percentage,

892
03:19:33,979 --> 03:19:47,670
but I have to do it. I'm fucked. Dodged it. I got grit though. I got grit. I got grit.

893
03:19:48,389 --> 03:19:58,629
I have to just land one. Just crit for 500 right now. Crit. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge it.

894
03:19:59,350 --> 03:20:11,659
I need 24. 24. Kill. Back. Back. Back. Back. Dodge. Whatever. All right. Don't be fucking hurt again.

895
03:20:11,659 --> 03:20:47,530
That was a crit and it's probably going to be hurt again. Oh, come on. Why? What? What? Yeah.

896
03:20:48,250 --> 03:21:49,989
He's elderly, dude. Kind of bring out Phoenix. Wait, this is pure silver. Wait, what happened?

897
03:21:50,709 --> 03:22:16,440
Oh yeah. Okay. Let's get it. 4,000 gold and pure silver. Let him rest. I just gave him nuts oil.

898
03:22:17,079 --> 03:22:25,530
Nuts oil is essentially sleep in a bottle. That's what it does. That's why during that training

899
03:22:25,530 --> 03:22:31,110
regimen, I'm able to give nuts oil and they don't have to sleep. What was that? Like weird glitch.

900
03:22:31,829 --> 03:22:43,899
It's weird. Is this guy going to get his revenge on me? I've one hit killed this guy

901
03:22:44,459 --> 03:23:11,000
a thousand times. Okay. Very nice. Duelist. Oh no. That's a good name. I like that name.

902
03:23:12,180 --> 03:23:33,639
Duelist. See, I've been doing, they're all getting hurt probably. Also, you laugh,

903
03:23:33,639 --> 03:23:42,819
you lose is going to be on Tuesday of this coming week. I think that might be the next stream. I've

904
03:23:42,819 --> 03:23:49,430
got a lot of stuff I have to do this next few, like three or four days. I wonder if I can sneak

905
03:23:49,430 --> 03:23:58,229
a stream in on Friday, but we're going to probably, it's not there right now, but we're

906
03:23:58,229 --> 03:24:06,659
probably going to set up a thing where you guys can recommend you laugh, you lose videos. Are you

907
03:24:06,659 --> 03:24:16,260
guys seeing that? Why is that happening? You guys saw that, right? The screen like is flickering.

908
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:22,629
Is that happening to you guys or is it just on my end? That's weird. It's not happening. Okay.

909
03:24:22,629 --> 03:24:32,659
So in the discord, just keep an eye over the next couple of days. There'll be probably either

910
03:24:33,379 --> 03:24:36,979
channel or something, or we'll set up a thing to make it so you can recommend

911
03:24:37,620 --> 03:24:45,780
some videos to watch. That's also the baby sensory stream. If you have no idea what I'm talking

912
03:24:45,780 --> 03:24:50,700
about, I'm going to open up a notepad. I'm going to watch baby sensory videos and I'm going to,

913
03:24:50,700 --> 03:25:01,530
in real time, describe to you how I feel. I'm going to lose. This guy did the same thing last time.

914
03:25:09,209 --> 03:25:28,340
Come here. God, call it back. Just do it. Go forward. I don't know which way this guy's

915
03:25:28,340 --> 03:25:51,129
trying to go. Oh my God, dude. Really? What? No, he's three and oh, I didn't even win the tournament.

916
03:25:51,129 --> 03:26:08,139
What? This guy's getting old. It's over. He's, he's old. I'll take the two grand. That's fine.

917
03:26:08,139 --> 03:26:24,200
He's old. Okay. That's fine. You did a good job. You made us like 50 grand over the course of the

918
03:26:24,200 --> 03:26:51,819
last year and a half, three year old birthday yet strong and even much stronger. It sounds like a

919
03:26:51,819 --> 03:27:18,549
math problem written out as a sentence. Here's your cake. All right. It's time to put him on ice.

920
03:27:18,549 --> 03:27:24,059
We got to A rank. It doesn't look well these days. I guess we have to consider his retirement.

921
03:27:24,059 --> 03:27:40,739
Who is it? Look at this. Ooh, let's load up. This is perfect. I'm going to load up a shitload because

922
03:27:40,739 --> 03:27:51,239
we're going to do the no, uh, no rest regimen. This is perfect. I'm going to buy like 10 of each.

923
03:27:51,239 --> 03:28:10,440
What can I sell? What is this? Medicine from the Far East life and skill will increase. However,

924
03:28:10,440 --> 03:28:29,940
speed will decrease. I have too many of these chips. I'm getting rid of one. That's stupid.

925
03:28:30,579 --> 03:28:44,940
Hey, let's get rid of this stuff. Just sell them. I need at least 80 K for the no rest regimen.

926
03:28:44,940 --> 03:28:59,459
Well, you can feed these to the monster, sell the chips. That is not that useful.

927
03:28:59,459 --> 03:29:11,639
Should I really just sell them all? Are they not that useful? No rest is $15,000 a year.

928
03:29:12,200 --> 03:29:18,500
It influenced the breeding. That's it. Chips are just money. I sell them. They could be used.

929
03:29:18,739 --> 03:29:23,750
We'll just get rid of them. I'm not going to use them. I'd rather buy the useful stuff to

930
03:29:23,750 --> 03:29:39,399
do the training regimen because they're all on sale. Did I get rid of the banana too?

931
03:29:39,399 --> 03:29:47,049
They just favor the breeding outcome. Disrelating to the species. Okay.

932
03:29:47,049 --> 03:29:57,559
You still has a decent bit of life left. Go get sound wave. It'll carry you to S rank since you're

933
03:29:57,559 --> 03:30:24,569
into so high. I'll keep the banana. I have six of each. That's I'm at my max unless I get rid of

934
03:30:24,569 --> 03:30:31,450
these 15 K per year. And you can sub the monster out during the months with the gold and silver to

935
03:30:31,450 --> 03:30:40,149
get 20,000 ish per year. Okay. You can see a beard on his face. You can. Let me see.

936
03:30:40,870 --> 03:31:13,270
No, you can't. He has a beard. Let me see. Oh, whatever. Put them on ice. It's time. It's time.

937
03:31:13,270 --> 03:31:27,450
You did a great job. You made us a lot of money. Bring it out. Phoenix. Phoenix is insane. Where

938
03:31:27,450 --> 03:31:52,260
are you? Skept. Look at these base stats. They're ridiculous. Let's go. I don't even know what the

939
03:31:52,260 --> 03:32:01,530
moves are, but I'm really excited. So everything is the same except for intelligence. Intelligence is

940
03:32:02,870 --> 03:32:14,920
monster gains on this guy. What's, what stat is the least for the Phoenix? Let's find out.

941
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:29,000
So there's literally no reason to ever do power. Power is worthless. Stat gains are E, which is

942
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:38,420
awful. So intelligence and everything else and don't ever do power. So just everything on

943
03:32:38,420 --> 03:32:52,360
intelligence and I'm assuming probably speed. What should I do? Let me see. Int and speed,

944
03:32:52,360 --> 03:33:02,549
probably. Int, speed and life. Int, speed, life and skill, I think is the order. Int, speed,

945
03:33:02,549 --> 03:33:20,629
life skill. Probably in that order. All right. Let's begin the regimen. Regimen is as follows.

946
03:33:20,629 --> 03:33:37,879
Regimen is, I need to look up what Phoenix's peak performance is. Okay. So they spend. They're a

947
03:33:37,879 --> 03:33:49,079
late bloomer, apparently. They hit their prime very, pretty late at their fifth and sixth stage

948
03:33:49,079 --> 03:33:57,829
of life. So they spend actually a pretty significant amount of time young, but we're not going to see

949
03:33:57,829 --> 03:34:13,379
very many stat gains. Go for it. All right. Training. You know what we're doing here.

950
03:34:13,379 --> 03:34:26,489
Real. Editate. Do errantries during the early stages too. Hooray for errantry farming.

951
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:31,620
We should go fucking do one right now. Literally. Just let's go right now.

952
03:34:32,280 --> 03:34:44,309
Errantry immediately. All right. Where's the, I need to get a good skill. What should I look for

953
03:34:44,309 --> 03:35:03,739
here? Pappas? This dude was just born yesterday. Why are you making him do this? Skill or int?

954
03:35:03,739 --> 03:35:15,290
Save it. That's so cute. Get a cute name. All right. Let's hurry up. Location. Let's go to.

955
03:35:19,459 --> 03:35:36,420
I'm going to say probably paripari or torbal for the skill. Or should I do Pappas for the speed?

956
03:35:36,420 --> 03:35:51,540
I don't know. I'm so indecisive. Cosmic Andy literally lived three years out of eight. Well,

957
03:35:51,540 --> 03:36:02,010
he's not dead. He's still alive. I'm going paripari. I skipped that text. Sorry. Sorry.

958
03:36:02,010 --> 03:36:05,209
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

959
03:36:05,209 --> 03:36:09,110
I'm just getting very distracted. I just want to fuck. You get one chance to do this. I don't

960
03:36:09,110 --> 03:36:43,899
want to fuck it up. He's so cute. Don't ever go to Torbal. It's useless. Got it. Oh, I got it. Nice.

961
03:36:43,899 --> 03:37:12,260
First try. Hell yeah. Didn't wait. Don't do it. These two wings. Fucking idiot. I guess you're a

962
03:37:12,260 --> 03:37:33,430
baby, but you can definitely do it. That's it. Nice. Good job. You know,

963
03:37:35,219 --> 03:37:41,340
errant trees might just be what I need to do because you get really, really small, less than

964
03:37:41,340 --> 03:37:47,659
four, less than three plus when they're babies. I'm going to end up with like plus 20 intelligence

965
03:37:47,659 --> 03:38:04,309
from this. If I got the money, might as well just do it. They take three weeks of life off of you.

966
03:38:04,389 --> 03:38:08,940
Oh, okay. These increases are huge though. I'm already almost at 250 intelligence.

967
03:38:09,659 --> 03:38:29,930
You didn't fight the thing at the end. Nice job. All right. Time for rest. What'd you get?

968
03:38:34,780 --> 03:38:48,969
Like cedar logs. Best nature. Oh, flame shot. Hell yeah. Force D hit percent A. Force D hit

969
03:38:48,969 --> 03:39:19,610
percent C. It costs a lot. All right. We need to do stress relief and sleep. Let's rest. I am fairly

970
03:39:19,610 --> 03:39:31,750
certain that this character will be able just to blow immediately through D rank. 250 intelligence

971
03:39:31,750 --> 03:39:55,379
already. Okay. What do we got? I think I'm just going to put them into the official cup and just

972
03:39:55,379 --> 03:40:07,879
skip a couple of grades at school. I don't want to fuck this up though. So we probably should do

973
03:40:07,879 --> 03:40:17,000
speed. Speed and intelligence probably number one, number two. Or should I just dump into

974
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:27,829
intelligence? If you get over 500 intelligence, go to Korea. You'll get the fire stream. Okay.

975
03:40:27,829 --> 03:41:09,500
Nice job. Tablet time. Take your pills. Take your medicine. All right. It's a new month.

976
03:41:10,059 --> 03:41:37,639
I'm going to do, let's do oil and then do heavy training. Mint leaf. Is there an intelligence

977
03:41:37,639 --> 03:41:45,750
and speed? There is. What's more important right now though? Focusing on intelligence or focusing

978
03:41:45,750 --> 03:42:05,430
on speed? I wonder. Just wait for the loyalty. Hour is going to be irrelevant. So leap is probably

979
03:42:05,430 --> 03:42:13,670
pretty good for this. Just swap between them. We'll do speed. I'll just jump between them.

980
03:42:24,219 --> 03:42:52,860
Nice. Very nice. Okay. Now let's do intelligence. When's the battle? Okay. I can do intelligence

981
03:42:52,860 --> 03:43:19,829
this time and then. All right. Should I even, should I just fuck it and just train the absolute

982
03:43:19,829 --> 03:43:38,100
hell out of this guy? Try to say guy and bird. And I ended up saying like pie. Okay. Not soil.

983
03:43:38,899 --> 03:43:55,129
Heavy speed and intelligence. He'll die in a year. Oh shit. I'm going to go for it. Whatever.

984
03:43:55,129 --> 03:44:05,959
Let's go for it. I'm going to beat the whole game in less than a year.

985
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:50,489
Doesn't he just come back? If he's a phoenix. I don't know. I want health too. All right. What

986
03:44:50,489 --> 03:45:12,409
the fuck did I just do? Okay. We're just doing the intelligence study. But once we get into the prime,

987
03:45:12,729 --> 03:45:36,500
has it been a BRB yet? No, not yet. I'm too addicted. I can't leave. Okay. Now we do. Oh,

988
03:45:37,059 --> 03:45:55,059
wait, I need to do oil, right? Yeah. What? I think so. Is this a BR? No, it is a fighting

989
03:45:55,059 --> 03:46:03,399
one versus one game. Get 300 skill and go to med bay. You can get a strong intelligence mood

990
03:46:03,399 --> 03:46:24,700
called that's not in this game. I just read your message for no reason. Speed again. Excellent.

991
03:46:28,920 --> 03:46:58,100
Come on now. That was only plus three. Okay. I'm going to do intelligence just straight up.

992
03:46:58,100 --> 03:47:25,659
Put on a face cam. All right. You get your face cam after I go to PRB. We'll do this one. I'll

993
03:47:25,659 --> 03:47:53,319
play. Just to make sure I can do it, right? I'm going to go with meditate. Freddy dread coming

994
03:47:53,319 --> 03:48:03,430
in with 50 community subs. Holy shit. Freddy. What's up Freddy? How's it going? Thanks for the

995
03:48:03,430 --> 03:48:14,579
million dollars or whatever that is. Plus one. What is that? Oh, thanks dude. Good to see you.

996
03:48:20,059 --> 03:48:42,219
So much. Okay. All right. We got this week. We're going to train and I'll rest and we'll do the

997
03:48:42,219 --> 03:48:59,610
tournament. That sounds good to me. Uh, life too. Maybe sprinkle it in. Not yet. Maybe later. Speed

998
03:49:09,850 --> 03:49:30,520
brisket has not failed a single training. Not one best nature. I think this is the, I honestly

999
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:35,739
really believe that before the stream turns off, we're going to do an insane training regimen

1000
03:49:35,739 --> 03:49:40,540
and this bird will be able to just wipe the floor with everybody. And I'll be able to skip like

1001
03:49:40,540 --> 03:50:00,739
eight. I'll be able to skip to a rank in like 45 minutes. All right. Let's rest. What's CD made

1002
03:50:00,739 --> 03:50:08,309
this? Uh, I had to unlock it by finding the feather in the volcano. And then I forget what song

1003
03:50:08,309 --> 03:50:32,950
actually was to get the cinder. Let's give it a go. All right. After this tournament, I'll go PA.

1004
03:50:32,950 --> 03:51:00,600
Promise. Thanks for reminding me to drink water. It's been like four hours. We can't lose. How do

1005
03:51:00,600 --> 03:51:09,479
you compare? Cause we did skip a whole rank pretty good. Even though we skipped E I'm very curious.

1006
03:51:09,479 --> 03:51:32,059
What are your moves like? Oh hell yeah. That was sick. Hang back. I got, I have high speed. All

1007
03:51:32,059 --> 03:51:52,260
right. Roger. Exactly what you want to see. Roger. All right. Okay. I'm not going to be super

1008
03:51:52,260 --> 03:52:18,629
powerful yet. I know Millium has low HP. There's also a skipping a rank too. Yeah. I mean, if I do

1009
03:52:18,629 --> 03:52:30,500
well here, that means the official tournament, I'll just do D and just skip right to see. Perfect.

1010
03:52:30,500 --> 03:52:50,629
Ooh. Uh, I think I'm just going to do power moves in there and just use beak. Nice. And then again,

1011
03:52:54,389 --> 03:53:20,260
stop doing that. Stop. I'm not doing any moves. There it is. All right. We are capable of doing

1012
03:53:20,260 --> 03:53:33,110
D rank. That's huge. That means the first tournament I do, I should be able to skip right

1013
03:53:33,110 --> 03:53:51,450
to see. And then we can focus on training. I don't have to win tournaments. Take a few bucks.

1014
03:53:52,010 --> 03:54:12,280
Should get a little more than that. I skipped a whole rank. Ooh. I probably should do tournaments

1015
03:54:12,280 --> 03:54:32,549
then. Maybe not the official ones. We'll do the non-official D tournaments. This one's not official.

1016
03:54:32,549 --> 03:54:38,620
2000. I'm going to do that one again. All right. Let's uh, go P. Right, right. Okay. Okay. Perfect.

1017
03:54:39,180 --> 03:58:07,610
See you guys in like two, three minutes. I have returned. Guess what I'm eating. What am I eating?

1018
03:58:07,610 --> 03:58:30,659
Nope. Cliff bar with what kind? Come on. We need to know. Blueberry crisp. Thank you. This is so good.

1019
03:58:30,659 --> 03:58:46,469
It really is. I used to hate these things. I used to think I was chewing on tar. I hated these things.

1020
03:58:46,469 --> 03:58:51,930
I thought they were terrible. I don't know if this is a new formula or if this is blueberry crisp.

1021
03:58:51,930 --> 03:59:00,729
The crisp versions of these are new, but these are a million times better than I remember.

1022
03:59:00,729 --> 03:59:20,790
This is fantastic. You promise to facecam? I will. Have you had a builder bar? No, I haven't.

1023
03:59:20,790 --> 03:59:44,860
Is this sponsored? No, it's not. Have you had a builder bear? No. I don't like that you put a

1024
03:59:44,860 --> 04:00:00,340
heart in it. It makes it like real and weird for me. Nope. It's, I don't know, it's weird.

1025
04:00:02,889 --> 04:00:07,690
When you build a bear, don't at the very end, you put a heart inside and you like seal it up.

1026
04:00:07,690 --> 04:00:18,549
I don't know. That's weird to me. I don't want to, I don't like it. I want this shit full of

1027
04:00:18,549 --> 04:00:21,110
stuffing. That's it. I don't want to put like a, I don't want to do like a freaking

1028
04:00:22,569 --> 04:00:33,979
seance. You whisper into the heart and you can have it have a secret message.

1029
04:00:33,979 --> 04:00:43,239
It's not German. It's a plushie. I know what it is. They're like every mall in America.

1030
04:00:43,239 --> 04:01:11,350
This is so good. Oh, I mean they look like they're high quality. I just don't want to like

1031
04:01:11,350 --> 04:01:27,370
breathe a wish into a heart and seal it inside of the thing's body. All right, let's go. It's

1032
04:01:27,370 --> 04:01:46,870
not a voodoo doll. Facecam? You guys seriously are, come on. Want to see what it looks like?

1033
04:01:46,870 --> 04:02:09,079
What do you think about that? But we need a worst hair candidate, right? It's not enough.

1034
04:02:09,079 --> 04:02:26,489
It's like, okay, you know what's really funny about hair? I look like a mad scientist right now.

1035
04:02:26,489 --> 04:02:34,360
I just made myself handsome. Do you see how fucking weird that is? Mad scientist, scary person,

1036
04:02:36,760 --> 04:02:52,309
handsome young man. Like why? Because I got something on my mouth. It was on my mouth.

1037
04:02:52,309 --> 04:03:07,579
Everyone was just freaked out. I thought I was going to do it in one bite. No, I would joke.

1038
04:03:07,579 --> 04:03:28,729
I'm still young. You're young until you're 50. That I believe. You look like your name would be

1039
04:03:28,729 --> 04:04:33,690
Maurice. I look tall today. Thanks. All right, I'm sick of holding this. Okay, I forgot to talk.

1040
04:04:33,690 --> 04:05:36,889
All right, let's go. Bye smart. I rest yet. Are you chewing a tire? It's a fucking cliff bar.

1041
04:05:42,899 --> 04:06:08,389
It takes ages to eat these. I didn't just bite into like a piece of deli turkey. I'm not kidding.

1042
04:06:08,469 --> 04:06:56,579
I'm still going. Almost done. Yeah, I have plenty of teeth. I guarantee you can't eat a cliff bar

1043
04:06:56,579 --> 04:07:07,659
in like 30 seconds. You'll fucking choke. Yeah, I have more than six teeth. I promise. I like

1044
04:07:07,659 --> 04:07:43,530
drinking on camera. This is a beer. All right, let's go. Show me your teeth. Give me the controller

1045
04:07:43,530 --> 04:07:57,579
while you're eating. I like wood. Training begins now. It's going to be air entry, isn't it? Come on.

1046
04:07:57,579 --> 04:08:10,739
Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. Air entry. Which one do I want to do? Which air entry do I want to do?

1047
04:08:10,739 --> 04:08:15,610
I'm just going to address this person because I think they've written this like 50 to 60 times

1048
04:08:15,610 --> 04:08:20,100
in the last two hours. This game copied among us. I'm just going to say it because I know that

1049
04:08:20,100 --> 04:08:27,899
it'll probably make you stop saying it. I've said it. There you go. Why is my face came so dark?

1050
04:08:27,899 --> 04:08:33,620
Because I... Okay, I was thinking about buying one of those ring lights. Then you'd see what I'd

1051
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:56,840
really look like. I don't want that. Why did you acknowledge it? What air entry do I want to do?

1052
04:08:56,840 --> 04:09:21,159
Scale one? Okay, it's cheap. Let's go. No, you guys said Torbo was awful. Speed or intelligence?

1053
04:09:21,159 --> 04:09:35,700
Mandy. Go to Mandy. Power in life, though. Pappas. I'll do Pappas. No, let's go.

1054
04:09:35,700 --> 04:09:53,700
Intelligence. You get something called Fire Twister. All right, we can skip this somehow,

1055
04:09:53,700 --> 04:10:14,309
right? I know I'm going to start becoming Skipping Andy. Didn't get it there. Sorry,

1056
04:10:14,309 --> 04:10:30,840
I got another chance. Nice. Give me that skill. Skulled it? Why? All right, didn't get one.

1057
04:10:30,840 --> 04:10:37,770
Your remaining skills are Fire Twister from Pappas and Fire Stream from Korea.

1058
04:10:37,770 --> 04:11:01,239
You need 500 intelligence. Okay. Pappas in Korea. All right, we need to rest. Sleep.

1059
04:11:01,239 --> 04:11:18,700
Just lost an S-ranked tourney by missing a 93% chance. Is this another air entry? Am I going

1060
04:11:18,700 --> 04:11:28,790
to do back-to-back air entries? Oh, all right, this is good. I'm going to use the mint leaf

1061
04:11:28,790 --> 04:11:50,809
right now, though. I'm going to do Heavy Technique. Oh no, I did that wrong. Oops. Oh well. I'll buy

1062
04:11:50,809 --> 04:12:06,579
nut oil instead. Move out of the junk. Disc chips. Burn them. Okay, I'll get another mint leaf. It's

1063
04:12:06,579 --> 04:12:35,479
not what I want. This one right here. Okay, good. We're not peeping any horrors. No. Speed. Speed.

1064
04:12:35,479 --> 04:12:57,370
Ooh, great. Come on. I can't get more than that. I wonder when become... When am I getting to Prime?

1065
04:12:57,370 --> 04:13:21,879
Probably not for a little while, right? I think I'm going to do Meditate. You're an Amazon Prime

1066
04:13:21,879 --> 04:13:55,799
streamer? What are you talking about? Intelligence, just normally. Nuts oil. Do Meditate again. This

1067
04:13:55,799 --> 04:14:13,319
time get it right. Oh, you're going to piss me off. You pissed me off. You pissed me off. Who do you

1068
04:14:13,319 --> 04:14:28,920
want? You have to have 17k for May. Oh shit. We have to unfreeze the wall to make some money?

1069
04:14:28,920 --> 04:14:46,180
What day is it? Okay, we have to bring the wall out to do this C rank because I need to have

1070
04:14:46,180 --> 04:15:07,879
$17,000 to get to this. So I can train here. Can I do this already? I'm supposed to forget what I

1071
04:15:07,879 --> 04:15:40,680
fed them. Please get it right. Good. Good. Good. Looks like the seed we saw has already germinated.

1072
04:15:40,680 --> 04:16:02,469
Ooh, very cool. Well, okay, we're gonna go make some money. Only nine more years. Yeah, that's good.

1073
04:16:02,469 --> 04:16:09,879
Okay, so we have to make this money. Oh, I guess I could. Yeah, I get the 3000. I want some wiggle

1074
04:16:09,879 --> 04:16:39,620
room. I don't want to be broke. Phoenix Prime can take four years. Holy shit. What? Go make some

1075
04:16:39,620 --> 04:17:05,000
money. I actually might just have the wall do this one and this one, right? Like who cares? If he dies,

1076
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:20,520
then I guess he's gonna die. Do you want to poll for this? This is C rank. Why you put a face cam

1077
04:17:20,520 --> 04:18:34,500
on if we can't even see you? There. You see me? Why would you ever vote against this? He's too old.

1078
04:18:34,579 --> 04:19:36,010
He's too old. Really? I actually lost. 20, 21, 22. Saved. Right at the buzzer. He's just too old.

1079
04:19:36,010 --> 04:20:01,500
He's just sloppy. Scammed. This actually, I'll probably do it in one hit. Maybe another hit.

1080
04:20:01,500 --> 04:20:19,579
How close is he to dying? I don't know. Probably pretty close. Well, to be fair, I am just farming

1081
04:20:19,579 --> 04:20:24,459
money with this guy. This is not... If you're voting at your own risk here, you're betting

1082
04:20:24,459 --> 04:20:32,059
at your own risk. I just want to make sure I have enough money where I'm not going to go broke so I

1083
04:20:32,059 --> 04:21:08,180
can still train the bird. It is free money. You have 750k. 750k what? Subscribers? That'd be weird.

1084
04:21:13,379 --> 04:21:25,930
Oh, it's followers? That's cool. Do you think I'll ever get to a million? That's the one thing. So on

1085
04:21:25,930 --> 04:21:33,700
YouTube, I've moved around too much. So I remember I was approaching like 700 or 800,000 subs on

1086
04:21:34,260 --> 04:21:47,000
German985 on YouTube, and I didn't get there. So I moved on to Twitch, started this channel,

1087
04:21:47,000 --> 04:21:53,590
getting to 750,000. The second channel has 700,000. I wonder if any of these platforms

1088
04:21:53,590 --> 04:22:00,420
will ever have a million. I might get close. It depends on how much longer I do this.

1089
04:22:02,090 --> 04:22:13,979
Third account. Yeah, but I get to say, right? I can say, well, you know, I have over 2.4 million

1090
04:22:14,540 --> 04:22:19,479
followers across his platforms. No, more than that. If you include Twitter and shit.

1091
04:22:21,000 --> 04:22:29,159
I've got over 2.5 million followers across all of my platforms. I can say that. Even though it's

1092
04:22:29,159 --> 04:22:52,940
fucking horse shit. What happened to Cosmic Andy? Cosmic Andy is going to be all right. How about,

1093
04:22:52,940 --> 04:23:21,450
how about it Cosmic Andy? One last A win. You can do it. Only four people. All right, let's go.

1094
04:23:21,450 --> 04:23:29,340
Time for Cosmic Andy to pull it out. This is five more grand. One last one Cosmic Andy. It's not

1095
04:23:29,340 --> 04:23:56,870
even his name. Let's go. So before five or 6,000 and I can solidify Cosmic Andy as an A rank,

1096
04:23:56,870 --> 04:24:18,969
technically S ranked monster. All I gotta do is flip a few coins and win. Let's go. 740 intelligence.

1097
04:24:18,969 --> 04:24:24,659
I'm going to pick my battle here. I'm not going to do anything right away.

1098
04:24:25,299 --> 04:24:42,940
Build up the guts. 34%. It's a big problem. And you drained me of my guts too. He's dead.

1099
04:24:43,500 --> 04:25:02,379
This little shit has won so many times. It's so unfair. I always have to fight this stupid

1100
04:25:02,379 --> 04:25:12,920
guy first. I can still make a few thousand dollars though. I just have to win. This character is

1101
04:25:12,920 --> 04:25:37,690
ridiculous. I just have to get a crit. Pray for a crit. Bounce away. Bounce back. Eat shit. I'm

1102
04:25:37,690 --> 04:25:44,700
going to get money. I actually get money. I think I'll get at least a thousand bucks.

1103
04:25:47,860 --> 04:25:59,909
Got to win one more. All right. Lampsweet wins. I have to beat Kitty. Oh no. Arkealan.

1104
04:26:00,469 --> 04:26:58,040
All right. This is a must win scenario right here. Fuck. 2,000. 200 for third place. What?

1105
04:26:58,040 --> 04:27:18,760
Okay. Put them on ice. Get them out of here. Dude, you're fucking up my schedule. I have to pay for

1106
04:27:18,760 --> 04:27:37,159
the stadium. Whatever it is. What happened? Oh, come on. I have to buy the... It skipped the week

1107
04:27:37,159 --> 04:27:53,750
that I need to build the stable. You know what? Go back to town. Just stay here. You tried. You're

1108
04:27:53,750 --> 04:28:21,989
just too old. I got the money that I wanted from the last one. So we're good. Let's go brisket.

1109
04:28:21,989 --> 04:28:31,879
Okay. We can do a little bit of a rest. How are you? Are you okay?

1110
04:28:35,620 --> 04:28:57,610
Intelligence. Is Brickette tired? I thought birds are supposed to be smart. Birds are supposed to

1111
04:28:57,610 --> 04:29:10,469
be intelligent. Here we go. Better provide the stable first than bread. If the stable is clean,

1112
04:29:10,469 --> 04:29:17,610
brisket can live comfortably. Besides, we cannot train a big monster with a small stable.

1113
04:29:17,610 --> 04:29:42,620
$15,000 to rebuild the stable. Brisket will be very happy. All right. Got it. Now I can get

1114
04:29:42,620 --> 04:30:09,100
huge monsters. Very cool. We got 4,300 bucks. All right. So now we do nut oil. Heavy train.

1115
04:30:09,100 --> 04:30:23,780
I can now get the big dog. Nice. All right. Meditate. Let's go.

1116
04:30:23,780 --> 04:30:37,639
Your receive award submissions close in two hours. That's right. Let's actually talk about that.

1117
04:30:37,719 --> 04:30:46,120
If there's something that you want to nominate, now is the time to do it. And then in a couple

1118
04:30:46,120 --> 04:30:52,549
of days, probably like two or three days over this weekend, I'd say by Sunday, I will put the poll

1119
04:30:53,110 --> 04:30:59,750
in the discord. I'll put it here and I'll tweet about it. So if you have something you want to

1120
04:30:59,750 --> 04:31:13,989
nominate, this is the last opportunity to do it. Have I caught a shiny yet? Not the right game.

1121
04:31:13,989 --> 04:31:25,260
Tablets. There are way too many submissions. Well, like all awards ceremonies, the nominations,

1122
04:31:25,500 --> 04:31:31,479
every single nominee is going to get in. It passes through a filter and some stuff is going to be

1123
04:31:31,479 --> 04:31:36,659
removed. It'll be narrowed down. So don't worry. There's going to be, it's not going to be,

1124
04:31:36,659 --> 04:31:51,299
you're not going to have to vote between one in 40 submissions for the same category.

1125
04:31:51,299 --> 04:32:24,180
Stress reduction. I'm going to do speed. 1984. Not getting increases. Come on. Get into the

1126
04:32:24,180 --> 04:32:35,100
prime of your life already. How old are you? Seven months. How long do they live? When can I expect

1127
04:32:35,100 --> 04:33:09,270
to see a prime here? Five years is prime. Three years. I want more speed. Tell people that when

1128
04:33:09,270 --> 04:33:12,389
they check the spreadsheet to control F and make sure they're not submitting the same thing. Yeah,

1129
04:33:12,389 --> 04:33:18,470
make sure you take, get a, give it a good look. Make sure you're not quadruple submitting the

1130
04:33:18,470 --> 04:33:41,779
same thing. Intelligence. I'm not going to do life until I can actually get good points for it.

1131
04:33:41,779 --> 04:34:09,369
I hope the toucan is getting paid. Should I do the official tournament? Yeah, we'll do this one.

1132
04:34:09,450 --> 04:34:48,740
Remember I skipped the rank, so I'm good to go. 330 intelligence already. Not even in my prime yet.

1133
04:34:48,740 --> 04:35:00,250
I might get this guy to 800 intelligence or more. All right. We'll do the tournament this week because

1134
04:35:00,250 --> 04:35:18,549
I need to make a little bit of money and he'll get stats. You're going to do Mario paint tonight.

1135
04:35:18,549 --> 04:35:45,740
Intelligence again. You probably get 802 stats. That'd be insane. Phoenix has the highest stat

1136
04:35:45,740 --> 04:35:57,560
growth in intelligence. So it will grow super fast like that. Nice job. All right. Let's kick

1137
04:35:57,560 --> 04:36:23,930
some ass. I need to buy more shit. I don't want to blow all my money. All right. That'll be a full

1138
04:36:23,930 --> 04:36:43,020
week battle. You missed somebody who was majoring in bird law. I watch always sunny too. I was going

1139
04:36:43,020 --> 04:37:05,509
to wink at you, but nah, thought about it though. How do we square up here? Really, really good.

1140
04:37:05,509 --> 04:37:28,709
I even have pretty good power compared to this guy. All right. Hold off here. I'm going to farm

1141
04:37:28,709 --> 04:37:37,689
some guts because I don't want to, well, actually stay back. You can't do anything. You used to be

1142
04:37:37,689 --> 04:37:52,540
in the phone. No. Oh, all right. You got to land something, dude. Like land and move 20 seconds.

1143
04:37:52,540 --> 04:38:28,500
There it is. Good dodges. All right. We're, we're good. Clean. Is him defense? Well, that's what I'm

1144
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:35,259
doing. Speed, speed and defense. Uh, don't work that well together. You should focus on one.

1145
04:38:35,259 --> 04:38:39,180
You can only realistically get maybe three or four stats even remotely increased.

1146
04:38:40,060 --> 04:38:44,630
I could do defense, but defense, I want some of the Lord masters to help me here. Defense, I think

1147
04:38:44,630 --> 04:38:52,729
is the worst stat in the whole game. They fixed that in the remake because defense is supposed to

1148
04:38:52,810 --> 04:39:05,799
be the worst stat in the game. The way that it's calculated is awful. Apparently you're much better

1149
04:39:05,799 --> 04:39:16,340
off just not getting hit and building a little defense. So I'm going to go speed. It fits

1150
04:39:16,340 --> 04:39:23,619
thematically. I'm a bird. I want to go speedy and dodge and fly and come on. It's thematics.

1151
04:39:23,619 --> 04:39:56,229
It doesn't hurt at all. It's a crit. Just let's go for the kill here. Any point you can take in

1152
04:39:56,229 --> 04:40:02,950
defense is better spent on life. Well, especially because life works on the expeditions. So speed

1153
04:40:02,950 --> 04:40:23,130
in life, it'll help the expeditions. Speed is technically defense. I feel like back,

1154
04:40:23,130 --> 04:40:27,669
back in the game here, I'm not just one button Andy. I actually have to move around and worry

1155
04:40:27,669 --> 04:40:38,069
about placement. It hasn't felt like this in a while. I could probably one hit kill this person.

1156
04:40:38,069 --> 04:40:53,880
Actually might be able to do it. Let's see. Don't get cocky. Oh yeah. All right,

1157
04:40:53,880 --> 04:41:08,540
I'm going to go for a talent face. 2000 bucks. What happened to Cosmic? He ate too much shoe

1158
04:41:08,540 --> 04:41:40,860
polish and died. Back to the training. I forgot that was 2000. Yeah. Oh, should I take those drugs?

1159
04:41:40,860 --> 04:42:08,759
Will that fuck me up too much? Will I like get sick? Not bad. Oh, I think I sold it. No, I didn't.

1160
04:42:08,759 --> 04:42:18,360
Where are they? Yeah, this life and skill will increase. Speed will decrease. What is this worth

1161
04:42:18,360 --> 04:42:35,450
it? Does this lose lifespan or should I just sell it? No, it's bad for lifespan. So we're just going

1162
04:42:35,450 --> 04:42:51,770
to sell these. Okay. It seems like all the items are not really worth using because they just bring

1163
04:42:51,770 --> 04:43:12,659
your total maximum lifespan down. 1500. That's a lot of money. All right. It reduces your lifespan

1164
04:43:12,659 --> 04:43:20,580
by five weeks. Your skill and life go up by 10. It reduces your speed by 10. Okay. All right. Let's

1165
04:43:20,580 --> 04:43:40,729
do it. I need to do a little training first, which will do intelligence. What about skill?

1166
04:43:41,290 --> 04:44:16,819
I'll do it. Hit the prime of your life already. I'm going to do an errand tree too.

1167
04:44:16,819 --> 04:44:42,580
Intelligence and skill. Bitchy nose. Meditate. So what am I looking for in an errand tree?

1168
04:44:42,580 --> 04:45:04,340
It was Papa's and Korea. Well, like the heat. Shit defense. You have a Wikipedia page now.

1169
04:45:04,340 --> 04:45:26,779
Only do an errand tree if you have intelligence at 500. Okay. So let's just get it to, let's just

1170
04:45:26,779 --> 04:45:58,310
burn it up to 500. Fire twister. Fire. That sounds awesome. What do you think about Spy Kids 2?

1171
04:45:58,310 --> 04:46:09,779
Um, is that the, is that the shark, uh, boy and lava girl? It's a different movie. Wait,

1172
04:46:09,779 --> 04:46:31,110
that's a different movie. Are you, are you sure though? Are you sure? The same director.

1173
04:46:31,110 --> 04:46:45,099
Spy Kids 3D was the best one. That was an Omega. Oh hell yeah. 17. We're not even in prime yet.

1174
04:46:45,099 --> 04:46:54,659
All right. We have to stop praising cause he's getting a little fond. He's getting a little

1175
04:46:54,659 --> 04:47:28,580
soft. Spoiled. Uh, speed. Pick it. It's a better game. Monster rancher or a wrestling empire.

1176
04:47:28,580 --> 04:47:51,770
That's not fair. They're both completely different things. Focus on skill now. I think we can. Oh,

1177
04:47:51,770 --> 04:48:00,020
I don't have enough intelligence to do this. Do I? Oh, okay. Well, come on. All right. I'm

1178
04:48:00,020 --> 04:48:13,500
going to do the skill one because it's a thousand bucks for like probably 10 to 20 guaranteed skill.

1179
04:48:13,500 --> 04:48:33,560
Do Mandy for the int move. Okay. It's power and life. Oh, should I do, should I just go

1180
04:48:33,560 --> 04:48:47,159
to Torbulent just for the skill or Papas for the speed? Mandy for the move. How much better is the

1181
04:48:47,159 --> 04:49:12,229
move and what I have now? Save. Mandy gives a move guaranteed. Oh, all right. Is it intelligence?

1182
04:49:12,229 --> 04:49:37,880
Is it actually intelligence? Mandy. And let's fight the plate. Yeah. I don't care about the

1183
04:49:37,880 --> 04:49:40,919
tournament cause I'm just going to skip it anyways. Cause this guy's going to be unbeatable.

1184
04:49:40,919 --> 04:49:49,720
Twisters. Let's just drop that. I'm not going to skip it if we haven't seen it yet.

1185
04:49:49,720 --> 04:50:15,799
I love the beam bag Sonic like Pepe dancing. Got it. Are you a monster rancher streamer now?

1186
04:50:15,799 --> 04:50:22,139
I told you this is going to happen until I at least got to S rank. I don't know if I'm going to

1187
04:50:22,139 --> 04:50:26,060
beat the whole game, but I definitely want to get to at least S. I want to, I want it to level up

1188
04:50:26,060 --> 04:50:33,270
at least two or three monsters to like full completion. I'm having fun. I think it's fun.

1189
04:50:33,830 --> 04:51:24,869
Did you make it? Oh no. Did it work? Kind of. Play Digimon world one. I'm not really into the

1190
04:51:24,950 --> 04:51:34,950
Digimon Pokemon. I only like this because it's big numbers. It's a really large scale between zero

1191
04:51:34,950 --> 04:51:40,729
and a thousand. I like the idea of pulling monsters randomly. That can be kind of combined

1192
04:51:40,729 --> 04:51:55,270
randomly. I like the RNG of this game. I don't like the RNG of Pokemon. These are not big numbers.

1193
04:51:55,270 --> 04:52:07,029
Zero to a thousand is not a big number. Digimon one is pretty much at this game.

1194
04:52:07,590 --> 04:52:15,770
Well, all other games don't exist to me. Other games are just not monster rancher.

1195
04:52:16,330 --> 04:52:25,979
Just remake this. Just remake Monster Rancher. Have it be not a remake, but a reboot.

1196
04:52:27,580 --> 04:52:33,580
I don't want a one-to-one just graphical update of the first game. Just reboot the whole franchise

1197
04:52:35,270 --> 04:52:42,099
and instead of there being like a hundred monsters have to be like 500. And instead of

1198
04:52:42,819 --> 04:52:48,419
two types, you'd have like the main type and the subtype. Have main type and like three subtypes

1199
04:52:48,419 --> 04:52:54,939
of something crazy. Don't make it pay to win bullshit either. Don't make it like paid

1200
04:52:54,939 --> 04:52:59,639
bullshit. I don't want to open up like gotcha containers for monsters. Don't do that. Please

1201
04:52:59,639 --> 04:53:19,540
God. I got the new technique. I can't praise. I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry. It's a hundred

1202
04:53:19,540 --> 04:53:56,020
percent would be gotcha if it was made today. Oh no. A to rest. Remember the TV burn person

1203
04:53:56,020 --> 04:54:15,400
updated in the discord. Please look. Are you serious? Wait, hold on. Really? It can't be.

1204
04:54:16,259 --> 04:54:27,580
It can't be. I need to see. I can't tell. Is it still there?

1205
04:54:35,369 --> 04:54:46,599
Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I have to show this. This is unbelievable. No fucking way. No way. I don't

1206
04:54:46,599 --> 04:54:55,860
believe you. This is one of the funniest images. This image is actually really funny because hold

1207
04:54:55,860 --> 04:55:03,029
on. The fact that there's people, we have to dissect this. We need to dissect this right now.

1208
04:55:06,090 --> 04:55:15,560
Okay. Hold on. You got to be kidding me, man. The fact that you're taking this photo, by the way,

1209
04:55:15,560 --> 04:55:24,860
like you're taking this photo, like hidden somewhere, like look, there's no fucking way, dude.

1210
04:55:24,860 --> 04:55:34,069
No, that would be so horrible.

1211
04:55:40,549 --> 04:55:45,509
The best part is the fact that you're taking this from like hidden in the staircase up. I don't know

1212
04:55:45,509 --> 04:55:50,470
where you are, but like, look at these people watching the TV. This image is unbelievable.

1213
04:55:50,470 --> 04:55:56,630
Like the sleeping dog. Like you guys have to deal with this now. You guys have to put up with this

1214
04:55:56,630 --> 04:56:05,209
now. This is unbelievable. What do you mean this is not real? What?

1215
04:56:18,470 --> 04:56:21,750
I mean, can we see the angle here? It looks like the angle is a little bit,

1216
04:56:24,759 --> 04:56:29,610
we need to cross reference the photos. Oh shit. You're right. That's perfect. Let's do some

1217
04:56:29,610 --> 04:56:45,450
detective work. We actually have to cross reference the photos. What are you doing?

1218
04:56:45,450 --> 04:57:17,270
What are you doing? Where's the clock? Is the clock here? It's real. But you can't see the

1219
04:57:17,270 --> 04:57:23,000
clock from this angle, but wait a minute. Look at that. I see the sound bar, same sound bar.

1220
04:57:23,000 --> 04:57:31,779
The console's in the same spot. Dude, let me just tell you, if this is real, this is one of the

1221
04:57:31,779 --> 04:57:54,459
funniest things I've ever fucking heard of. I can't believe that you've ruined your TV. It's so stupid.

1222
04:57:55,990 --> 04:58:05,430
You know, I think we need, we need a little bit, we need one, we need one more piece of proof.

1223
04:58:06,549 --> 04:58:17,939
I need, I need this, this is proof, like real proof. What about the fake reflection?

1224
04:58:19,290 --> 04:58:23,450
We needed, we need another picture, but we need one or we need a video.

1225
04:58:24,169 --> 04:58:30,419
All right, if you can get me a video, if you can get me a video, I swear to God, I'm not

1226
04:58:30,419 --> 04:58:37,349
fucking around right now. I am not kidding around. If you can get me a video where this is real,

1227
04:58:38,150 --> 04:58:43,110
I swear to God, I am not kidding. I will put you in touch with Community Jake

1228
04:58:43,110 --> 04:58:59,380
and I will get you a new TV. I swear to God, this is too funny, but make sure, make sure in your video,

1229
04:58:59,380 --> 04:59:03,029
well, I will have one of the mods take a look at it because I want to make sure you don't,

1230
04:59:03,029 --> 04:59:16,860
you know, no personal information or anything, right? All I need is that TV. God. Okay,

1231
04:59:16,860 --> 04:59:30,950
let's get back to this. I just imagine everybody else that has to watch the TV in this house is

1232
04:59:30,950 --> 04:59:45,270
probably just, how irritated must you be? Was this a new TV? I don't know. They probably hate me.

1233
04:59:45,990 --> 04:59:57,369
Remember, why are all your fans insane? Look, this was an easy mistake. If you get us a video,

1234
04:59:57,369 --> 04:59:59,930
I might, it might be, I might not be able to stop laughing. I might have to leave,

1235
05:00:00,569 --> 05:00:06,619
but definitely make sure if you're going to make, if you actually, if this is not a joke

1236
05:00:06,619 --> 05:00:11,689
and you're actually going to take a video, please, you know, protect your privacy. I don't want like

1237
05:00:11,689 --> 05:00:14,729
your, I don't want to like blow up your spot or anything. You know what I mean? Just we'll,

1238
05:00:14,810 --> 05:00:19,029
we'll have one of the mods look at it to make sure that's absolutely hysterical. Let's keep playing.

1239
05:00:32,069 --> 05:00:47,639
God, look at this air entry again. If this is real, I'll have to probably leave too,

1240
05:00:47,639 --> 05:00:52,279
cause I'll start sobbing. I don't, that might be the most, I don't think we can even nominate it.

1241
05:00:52,279 --> 05:00:57,560
It's literally in four hours, one guy, the year nominations close. I think that we just have to

1242
05:00:57,560 --> 05:01:21,720
give that a pass that like it's, it could be one of the greatest ever. I can't focus on anything

1243
05:01:21,720 --> 05:01:31,060
right now. Having that in my brain. That's so ridiculous. Okay. What was I, what's going on

1244
05:01:31,060 --> 05:02:18,900
item shop? Oh, they are cheaper. Nice. Okay. What was the last thing I did? What about the camera?

1245
05:02:18,900 --> 05:02:39,979
Right. Sorry about that. I'm breathing. I'm fine. What was the last thing I did before that bird

1246
05:02:39,979 --> 05:02:46,200
rested after being stressed. Okay. So now we can just go back to starting over. I want intelligence

1247
05:02:46,200 --> 05:03:13,080
and skill. Go for it. Oh, check that. I got to move. Right. What? Yes. Gold. Hired. What?

1248
05:03:13,080 --> 05:03:29,270
Kind of hate you to be honest. Why? What? I'm sorry. I hate me. I don't want anyone to hate me.

1249
05:03:29,270 --> 05:03:56,500
All right. Skill. Simulate the burning. Oh, I just got like an electrocuted. You even get like a

1250
05:03:56,500 --> 05:04:16,919
chill that just like electrocutes your whole body. Oh, one year birthday. You know, a week from now

1251
05:04:16,919 --> 05:04:21,159
during the you laugh, you lose challenge, the video's not even going to make me laugh. I'm

1252
05:04:21,159 --> 05:04:25,400
going to like see that family sitting watching the TV. It's going to pop into my head and

1253
05:04:25,400 --> 05:04:51,779
I'm going to start laughing for the good work for scat. Seems well. Let's do the stress relief.

1254
05:04:51,779 --> 05:05:09,189
Intelligence. I wanted really hammer intelligence because I got to get it over 500 so I can get

1255
05:05:09,189 --> 05:05:36,900
flame tornado. Nice. Oh, 12 tablets. Always tablets. Nothing but tablets only. All right.

1256
05:05:36,900 --> 05:05:46,919
Dragon quest. I would probably like dragon quest. It's just never committed to it.

1257
05:05:46,919 --> 05:05:59,209
400 int and speed from Papa's. Oh, okay. I'll keep that in mind. I should probably do a. Yeah,

1258
05:05:59,209 --> 05:06:10,869
I'll do a tournament. We'll do this one. Why you always broke every other streamer I've seen. This

1259
05:06:10,869 --> 05:06:15,939
has a lot of money. Well, I had like 20 grand. I just used it. I upgraded the house. I had like

1260
05:06:15,939 --> 05:06:33,939
23,000 24,000. Oh, I'm strict. I got to change that. I really like dragon quest 11 the most

1261
05:06:33,939 --> 05:06:56,099
because you get to see enemies on the map. That's huge for me. Yeah, I got to be less strict.

1262
05:06:56,099 --> 05:07:04,919
Go for it. Oh, I didn't even look at the I didn't even look at the move. You're right.

1263
05:07:04,919 --> 05:07:15,349
Lot of intelligence. I need to get that speed and life up. Oh, shit. It's heat beam. I got to take

1264
05:07:15,349 --> 05:07:26,759
a look at that. Whoa. This character is awesome. That's a lot of guts, though. It's not very good

1265
05:07:26,759 --> 05:07:55,779
percentage. Probably does a lot of damage on dude. Really angry means you're going to miss.

1266
05:07:55,779 --> 05:08:10,700
That's why we build speed. Precisely why I need speed at least at 300 before I even

1267
05:08:10,700 --> 05:08:16,310
attempt C or B. Can you do Homer Simpson impression? I like that show. And I thought

1268
05:08:16,310 --> 05:08:30,840
it might be funny. Yeah, but you can't use that. The submissions are over. You can't use it.

1269
05:08:30,840 --> 05:08:50,549
First, it wins by default. They're afraid of me. Could have said no. Then I wouldn't have offended

1270
05:08:51,189 --> 05:09:13,000
them to leave. I like gatekeep my own new viewers. It's weird. Oh, guys, I'm going to do this thing

1271
05:09:13,000 --> 05:09:24,099
where like a new viewer is going to come and hate me. I do that all the time. I don't want

1272
05:09:24,099 --> 05:09:27,540
anybody to hate me. I just said I didn't want hate. I don't want people to hate me. I really like

1273
05:09:27,540 --> 05:09:35,099
really don't. Look, if you like actually hate me, that makes me like feel like shitty. I like hope

1274
05:09:35,099 --> 05:09:50,470
you really don't. I don't know. People probably do. I don't know. I like hate that feeling.

1275
05:09:50,869 --> 05:10:09,099
Nice. As long as you like yourself. Yeah, I'm very happy and comfortable with me. I am. I'm

1276
05:10:09,099 --> 05:10:21,020
just pretty comfortable. I don't be too much of a dick though. All right. All right. Good job.

1277
05:10:21,020 --> 05:10:35,720
You learn some stuff. Do I have enough items? All right. Rest. When's the new week? All right.

1278
05:10:35,720 --> 05:11:07,049
We'll do a rest. Sleep. Yes. Drill intelligence. I want an air entry. Let's go. I'm sorry for

1279
05:11:07,049 --> 05:11:29,419
calling you broke earlier. I don't matter. All right. Tablets. I'm starting to see

1280
05:11:29,419 --> 05:11:52,500
increases in the amount of stats I'm getting the first time here. What's up? We are well.

1281
05:11:52,500 --> 05:12:12,150
We're going to take a nut oil and then we're going to do heavy intelligence training or do it. No.

1282
05:12:12,150 --> 05:12:36,419
Yes. Make it great. 400. Hell yeah. Now I'm going to focus on skill and speed for a little while.

1283
05:12:36,419 --> 05:13:02,659
Let's go with skill. I'm going to alternate between skill and speed. You can't just dump

1284
05:13:02,659 --> 05:13:12,650
everything in one stat and you're just going to lose. You'll get killed. These increases are so

1285
05:13:12,650 --> 05:13:45,900
small. What are your thoughts on beans? I love beans. Speed. We'll go with this one. I want to

1286
05:13:45,900 --> 05:14:04,520
int and skill from Papa's. Should be good. Ready to go. No tournament. No official tournament

1287
05:14:04,520 --> 05:14:27,509
because I don't want to lose fame for going up or going back down. When's the next battle?

1288
05:14:27,509 --> 05:14:48,619
Not for a while. Not yet. Do I do life? Yeah. I got to sprinkle some life in here. Come on.

1289
05:14:50,409 --> 05:15:05,540
Otherwise I'm going to be a little like weenie. Here we go. Play Hearthstone Battle Royale.

1290
05:15:06,419 --> 05:15:18,939
I have 150 wins in first place in Hearthstone Battle Royale. Wait I made that up. I don't think

1291
05:15:18,939 --> 05:15:35,610
that's a lie. No I have 150 fourth place or higher ranks and like 50 first place wins. I had like

1292
05:15:35,610 --> 05:15:54,229
five or six thousand rating when I cared. 5200 or something? 5100? Win one right now. I can't.

1293
05:15:54,229 --> 05:16:00,060
The only way you could. No I couldn't. You have to play that shit every day and every time they

1294
05:16:00,060 --> 05:16:07,880
make a new update you have to play it because as of now there's been 10 new characters and like

1295
05:16:07,880 --> 05:16:17,560
40 new cards. I'm just getting my ass kicked for like a week. All right more training.

1296
05:16:17,560 --> 05:16:35,259
What was the last thing I did? Oh fuck it whatever. All right speed and intelligence. No

1297
05:16:35,259 --> 05:16:59,259
intelligence and skill. I will never stream Hearthstone ever again. I'll never stream it

1298
05:16:59,259 --> 05:17:34,900
again. Are you going to play Peggle? Nah. What about Yu-Gi-Oh? Nah. Good job. Oh really good job.

1299
05:17:34,900 --> 05:17:51,590
Hell yeah. 11 points. All right when I get I do a lot of spinning like this. I was just spinning

1300
05:17:51,590 --> 05:18:09,580
around in my chair. It's probably distracting I'm sorry. Speed and intelligence again. Not getting

1301
05:18:09,580 --> 05:18:32,409
hit sometimes is almost more important than getting hit. Than getting hits. Do not eat a magic banana.

1302
05:18:32,409 --> 05:18:51,509
Oh it's a glitch. Do list of the roses. It's chess combined with Yu-Gi-Oh. Sounds pretty good. Speed

1303
05:18:51,509 --> 05:19:05,159
again. What's a game that you could confidently speed run? Uh I actually tried to do Mario 64

1304
05:19:05,159 --> 05:19:12,259
recently just in my own time. Uh I was able to do the bomb glitch through the wall where you go

1305
05:19:12,259 --> 05:19:19,049
like yeah what and you grab the bomb and boom through the gate. I did it a few times but then

1306
05:19:19,049 --> 05:19:24,169
I realized it took me like two or three hundred attempts to do that like while I was just sitting

1307
05:19:24,169 --> 05:19:37,610
on the couch. I said I'm not I don't want to do this ever again. I don't have the patience for it.

1308
05:19:37,610 --> 05:19:51,450
I just don't. That's not a fake story. I could probably do it right now if I really sat there

1309
05:19:51,450 --> 05:20:14,470
for like 10 to 20 minutes. I'm not kidding I could probably do it right now. Do it right now?

1310
05:20:14,470 --> 05:20:34,919
You want me to do it right now? Thinking about it. I'm thinking about going and getting the switch.

1311
05:20:34,919 --> 05:20:39,779
And yes I'm I did it on the switch and I have everyone says don't play it on the switch. Switch

1312
05:20:39,779 --> 05:22:21,419
has input lag. That means I did it on the switch with the input lag. With the Joy-Cons. Okay uh so

1313
05:22:21,419 --> 05:22:34,869
look what I already have a save point right here. I already have a save point right here. Why would

1314
05:22:34,869 --> 05:22:42,840
I have a suspend point there if I wasn't doing this? Huh? What do you think? You want to see

1315
05:22:42,840 --> 05:22:56,869
something fucking happen on this stream? I'll show you the practice that I've had. Move this out of

1316
05:22:56,869 --> 05:23:13,189
the way. Can you see? Can you see it? All right you can't see it. Hold on let me. I let me move this

1317
05:23:13,189 --> 05:23:25,509
shit out of the way. I how am I gonna be able to do this shit? I'm gonna I need the dock. I need the

1318
05:23:25,509 --> 05:23:32,779
dock. I actually think I need the dock for this because I'm gonna be like uncomfortable. Let's

1319
05:23:32,779 --> 05:23:55,049
punch again. Okay uh let me see. Let's punch. I need the I actually need the dock. You ready?

1320
05:23:55,049 --> 05:26:11,500
Here we go. Fuck. I fucked it up. Fuck. I'm getting the dock. I'll be right back. I'm not

1321
05:26:11,500 --> 05:26:50,340
ready yet. Why can't I see it? Plugged in. Put the music on. All right here you go. I'm doing this on

1322
05:26:50,340 --> 05:26:57,369
stream right now. It's gonna be so like scuffed. It's gonna be terrible looking. Okay I need a

1323
05:26:57,369 --> 05:27:14,040
the video capture device. What the hell is it? We're gonna add video capture device. What the fuck?

1324
05:27:14,040 --> 05:27:45,880
Hello? What just happened? Can you see me? Can anybody hear me? What the fuck is go-

1325
05:27:46,040 --> 05:29:40,549
What the fuck is happening? Dude I swear to god. I swear to god. Can you guys hear me? I just I went

1326
05:29:40,549 --> 05:29:50,659
live to try to go to come back and this shit was like somebody's already live on your channel. It

1327
05:29:50,659 --> 05:29:54,740
was like oh yeah there's a connection error trying to stream to this. My screen was like black. That

1328
05:29:54,740 --> 05:30:06,439
was weird. What the hell? The VOD's probably so fucked up now. All right let's go. I'm going for

1329
05:30:06,439 --> 05:30:16,060
this right now. I'm gonna get this. I swear to god. That was that was really really weird. All

1330
05:30:16,060 --> 05:30:24,950
right hold on. Sorry about that. I'm back. Give me give me a second. Ask me what the fuck that was.

1331
05:30:36,700 --> 05:30:42,380
Okay let's do this. It's not going to be perfect but I have to desync myself.

1332
05:30:51,400 --> 05:30:54,169
It's not going to be perfect. Just relax.

1333
05:30:59,689 --> 05:31:10,680
Okay there we go. So now I have to put this on this tv. All the- I'm swear I'm gonna get it. I

1334
05:31:10,680 --> 05:31:16,279
swear to god. What a viewer drop. Well I mean the whole stream fucking exploded.

1335
05:31:16,279 --> 05:31:37,080
He'll be back. Don't worry. He'll be back. Okay let me just plug this in here. Watch this shit.

1336
05:31:37,080 --> 05:31:42,979
You ready for this? You ready?

1337
05:32:01,799 --> 05:32:12,459
Fuck. It's just end point.

1338
05:32:36,759 --> 05:32:51,610
God damn it. I get it. I fucking hate these little things.

1339
05:32:56,020 --> 05:33:25,720
Yes. My knees. I swear to god I've done this like three or four times.

1340
05:33:34,259 --> 05:33:44,250
I'm gonna smash these into a million fucking pieces.

1341
05:33:44,250 --> 05:34:06,090
I'm getting the controller. I'm getting the real controller. I'll be back.

1342
05:34:06,090 --> 05:34:32,889
Oh my fuck. I forgot. I just leaked the dashboard. Now you all know I bought this.

1343
05:34:32,889 --> 05:34:40,459
And I wrote like a tweet saying this thing but I would never buy it.

1344
05:34:48,919 --> 05:35:11,479
Hello? I have to re- oh change grip and order. Stupid fucking thing.

1345
05:35:11,479 --> 05:35:26,599
I'm gonna get this or I won't turn the stream off. Let's go. Can you guys hear it? Is it loud?

1346
05:36:18,860 --> 05:36:22,740
Fuck you game. Oh it says I'm playing Monster Rancher. This is wrong.

1347
05:36:22,740 --> 05:36:45,799
It's gonna- I'll get it in a second. We'll go right back. Oh what?

1348
05:36:45,799 --> 05:37:07,720
What? No!

1349
05:37:29,900 --> 05:38:21,209
Hug the wall? Oh fuck you. That was it. Oh that was gonna be it. Damn it.

1350
05:38:45,580 --> 05:39:16,389
Gamer card deactivated. Not yet. I had it so close. God damn it. I hate this game.

1351
05:39:16,470 --> 05:39:25,220
Did we break a thousand? Wait there's not even a thousand viewers here? What happened? What?

1352
05:39:25,220 --> 05:39:57,669
I don't even have a thousand viewers? God. It's ten thousand? Okay. I've gotten it before. I

1353
05:39:57,669 --> 05:40:47,849
swear to god. Dude this dude's past his prime. 30. Past his prime. I'm 36. Oh my god. Believe in me.

1354
05:40:56,409 --> 05:41:01,540
Mario goes like this to turn around. Oh it's the fucking dumbest thing. I hate this game.

1355
05:41:28,740 --> 05:41:54,599
Oh wait a minute. I think I'm supposed to do that. Fuck you. It's chat. What's going on in chat right

1356
05:41:54,599 --> 05:42:13,220
now? What are you guys doing? You suck. I don't. Stop. I'm gonna say losing viewers. Say gaining

1357
05:42:13,220 --> 05:42:38,580
viewers so I get confidence. What happened? That was it. Oh my god. I could never do this.

1358
05:43:12,220 --> 05:43:20,310
How many viewers are here? Losing viewers.

1359
05:43:45,610 --> 05:43:54,630
I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I can't do it. I give up.

1360
05:43:54,630 --> 05:44:04,229
I actually can't do it. I give up. Just ground pound the pole. No. No. You don't. That's not

1361
05:44:04,229 --> 05:45:04,220
what I'm trying to do. Oh fuck. You explode already. That was the one. You fucking idiot.

1362
05:45:04,220 --> 05:45:34,200
Yeah. All right. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Did you tell that I've been practicing?

1363
05:45:36,729 --> 05:45:54,279
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

1364
05:45:54,279 --> 05:46:03,540
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. That's it. I'm done. Fucking practice makes perfect, baby.

1365
05:46:04,099 --> 05:46:16,389
What else we got? What else have I been practicing? How about this one?

1366
05:46:28,150 --> 05:46:50,409
All right. So we're gonna play Monster Rancher again. Never playing fucking Super Mario ever

1367
05:46:50,409 --> 05:47:14,889
again. What the fuck happened there, by the way? My stream crashed three times. I told you I was

1368
05:47:14,889 --> 05:47:35,099
gonna do it before the stream ended. Fix this. Fix that. You earned it. Well, now I have to do

1369
05:47:35,099 --> 05:47:51,419
that in like 17 and a half minutes. We're back. We're ready. I don't remember anything that just

1370
05:47:51,419 --> 05:48:09,700
happened. Sorry for the crashing. Should not be a delay anymore. What do I wanna do now? Why are

1371
05:48:09,700 --> 05:48:17,990
you angry? I wasn't angry. I mean, I was angry at Mario 64. You just blacked out for the whole

1372
05:48:17,990 --> 05:48:23,209
thing? Okay. What was the last thing that I did? Which has been breaking a lot today. Actually,

1373
05:48:23,209 --> 05:48:48,150
that hurt. Yeah. I heard that too. I think I rested. Let's just go. Oh, here we go. Right.

1374
05:48:48,150 --> 05:48:52,709
All right. Let's do, um, we'll rest and then we'll take, uh, brisket into the fight.

1375
05:48:53,349 --> 05:49:16,680
I'm glad I actually got to prove myself. I want the skill points. This should be pretty easy.

1376
05:49:21,259 --> 05:49:39,849
I need to turn the switch off. I love Jerma, but I just can't enjoy his non-Super Mario 64 streams.

1377
05:49:39,849 --> 05:49:52,979
He should just stick with what he was good at. That's so stupid. You know, I was thinking,

1378
05:49:52,979 --> 05:49:59,400
you, okay, there's a deeper reason as to why I was practicing that. I wanted so badly just to

1379
05:49:59,400 --> 05:50:06,200
go live one day with splits and actually really desperately try to get like sub 25 minutes.

1380
05:50:07,880 --> 05:50:19,419
Just to just not tell you guys at all. But then I saw how much actual work skill and dedication

1381
05:50:19,419 --> 05:50:37,900
it takes to do that. And I threw that idea out the window. All right, let's farm here.

1382
05:50:37,900 --> 05:51:04,060
That takes so much guts and I don't even know if it's worth joining. I'm going to kill. Oh,

1383
05:51:04,060 --> 05:51:12,569
not quite like I got a headache from that Super Mario thing. Did I really think I was going to

1384
05:51:12,569 --> 05:51:19,369
be able to hold it this way and do that? You got to be kidding me. I was just too lazy to get the

1385
05:51:19,369 --> 05:51:40,619
dock. Can I have a turn or am I just going to keep doing this? Any more question? Are you all

1386
05:51:40,619 --> 05:51:57,450
right? Yeah, I'm good. What are you talking about? I feel great. How long have I even been streaming

1387
05:51:57,450 --> 05:52:19,299
for? Six hours. We'll keep going for a little bit. Six hour Andy. Yeah, I am a six hour Andy.

1388
05:52:19,299 --> 05:52:35,740
He's actually really funny because I'm, when I was bringing the switch here, it was open on YouTube

1389
05:52:36,700 --> 05:52:43,020
and I was, I must've been, I don't, I don't even remember. I was really tired. It was, it was like

1390
05:52:43,020 --> 05:52:48,119
an XQC playthrough. Like he was playing something like a horror game. And I was probably like, oh

1391
05:52:48,119 --> 05:52:57,479
yeah, get scared. I was literally, that's what was open. I must've been watching it last time. I had

1392
05:52:57,479 --> 05:53:15,080
the switch open. Juicer. I can't say I'm a juicer. I'm a juicer. What's wrong with that?

1393
05:53:15,720 --> 05:53:25,979
You know, the best part about being like a new juicer is this like 600 years of XQC streams.

1394
05:53:28,569 --> 05:53:43,860
I got a long way to go. It's like, oh wow. Look at all this. Look at all this. It's here. Stop

1395
05:53:43,860 --> 05:54:03,080
calling yourself that you weirdo. I got a lot of fame for that. Very good. Very good. Already have

1396
05:54:03,080 --> 05:54:23,659
more health than the entirety of our training for Calamity. Still on the grind? Not really. I just

1397
05:54:23,659 --> 05:54:38,619
like having fun. Remember, you're not allowed to like other streamers. He's cheating on us.

1398
05:54:39,180 --> 05:54:52,700
Remember, you doing that Mario 64 bit gave me anxiety and a stomach ache.

1399
05:54:53,340 --> 05:55:15,500
All right. Good fight. Good battle. Yeah. You guys kept talking about peep the horror. All of a

1400
05:55:15,500 --> 05:55:20,540
sudden you see a Mario 64 horror and you leave. I lost like, well, that doesn't, that's not fair.

1401
05:55:21,560 --> 05:55:28,790
I lost 2000 people because of the crash. That's what I'm going to tell myself when I'm taking

1402
05:55:28,790 --> 05:55:40,740
a bath later crying. All right. Let's go for it. Training. Grill. I want speed and intelligence.

1403
05:55:40,740 --> 05:55:57,590
I want speed. When are you going to do a snowman stream? I don't know what you're talking about.

1404
05:56:05,830 --> 05:56:09,849
Tablets. Always. Tablets when you're doing the training regimen.

1405
05:56:10,650 --> 05:56:16,389
It doesn't really snow in Vegas. Not really. I need to move this camera though. It's wrong.

1406
05:56:17,939 --> 05:56:22,099
It does not really snow here. Maybe, maybe once a year or once every couple of years

1407
05:56:22,099 --> 05:56:37,240
there'll be enough to see. But not really. I love it here though. It's really, really cold

1408
05:56:37,240 --> 05:56:43,659
and really, really hot. During December, January, February, it gets to be 30, 40 degrees here

1409
05:56:43,659 --> 05:56:52,540
Fahrenheit. I like it. It's kind of like a chilly dry. I like it a lot. We're going to be able to

1410
05:56:52,540 --> 05:57:00,500
get the new move. And then in the summertime it gets like 110, 115, 118 degrees Fahrenheit. I love

1411
05:57:00,500 --> 05:57:18,220
it. I'm just, I'm a weirdo. All right. Okay. Let's do mint leaf and then we're going to do

1412
05:57:18,220 --> 05:57:26,409
the errand tree. And I want to do Papa's errand tree, right? You miss Boston? Um, sometimes. I

1413
05:57:26,409 --> 05:57:30,520
miss the people in Boston. Not necessarily the place. It's kind of how it is though.

1414
05:57:39,529 --> 05:57:55,880
Papa's is where I can get the tornado move. It seems that there is some chance to acquire

1415
05:57:55,880 --> 05:58:08,840
a new technique. I can definitely handle. Yeah, this one. I don't care about the tournament.

1416
05:58:08,840 --> 05:58:13,419
We're going to skip it anyways. You're going to bed now. Good night. Well, have a good night.

1417
05:58:16,139 --> 05:58:19,580
Yeah. I'll probably won't stream for that much longer. Once we hit six plus hours or so,

1418
05:58:20,220 --> 05:58:26,040
which means you're going to have to see monster rancher too again, which I'm fine with.

1419
05:58:27,099 --> 05:58:49,900
Got it. Got the skill chapstick. Is this a burst piece? I'm only 30 minutes in. Oh, that's right.

1420
05:58:49,900 --> 05:59:02,389
The screen crashed. Start raising skill. Yeah. Once I get to speed, cause I'm going to hammer

1421
05:59:02,389 --> 05:59:10,470
skill. Once, uh, I get into prime, but I really do want like 300 speed and like four or 500

1422
05:59:10,470 --> 05:59:15,750
intelligence before I hammer skill. Cause I'm going to just pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump

1423
05:59:15,750 --> 05:59:22,569
into skill. Once I get, um, out of the kind of adolescent stage. What's the flavor? Uh,

1424
05:59:22,569 --> 05:59:31,130
the flavor of this bird's bees is coconut and pear. It's pretty good. All right. Let me take a look

1425
05:59:31,130 --> 05:59:46,520
at the moves that this guy has. I actually do need to do a tournament though. Why you do

1426
05:59:46,520 --> 05:59:53,799
chapstick so much? Well, uh, because my lips get really dry and I have this sort of tendency

1427
05:59:54,779 --> 06:00:15,220
constantly be like all the time air entry again. Oh no, that's good. I'll take it and honest. Oh,

1428
06:00:15,220 --> 06:00:30,220
very tired. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll get some rest. I'm going to ask you about your dry

1429
06:00:30,220 --> 06:00:48,150
lips every stream. Yeah. I'm pretty much a lizard. I do need to buy some items. Don't lose all my

1430
06:00:48,150 --> 06:01:02,229
money. I will be pissed if I do. Can I sell something? Why is the plant one 1500? Is there

1431
06:01:02,229 --> 06:01:16,310
an update on the TV yet? I don't think so. I don't think we have a TV update. Is a good reason why

1432
06:01:16,950 --> 06:01:24,900
I saw Connor choke you the other day. You all right? Yeah. I was, it was uncalled for.

1433
06:01:24,900 --> 06:01:31,049
He's reached over and start choking my neck as hard as he could. I was like, what the heck, man?

1434
06:01:31,689 --> 06:01:58,389
I need the money. I need the money. How many I'll buy a couple more. I can only buy one more.

1435
06:01:58,470 --> 06:02:15,580
All right. That's fine. Have you eaten today? Yeah. I've eaten twice. Okay. You need to rest.

1436
06:02:16,139 --> 06:02:31,029
What did I have to eat? Well, you watched me eat a cliff bar and then earlier I had a coffee

1437
06:02:32,490 --> 06:02:43,819
and some air. So I actually didn't eat at all. I was lying. Battle today. No, I need to train.

1438
06:02:44,540 --> 06:03:02,169
Be life. Should I start? Not yet. What is wrong with streamers? Um, I'll tell you what's wrong

1439
06:03:02,169 --> 06:03:08,119
with streamers. A lot of us don't really want to eat on camera and the prospect of eating

1440
06:03:08,119 --> 06:03:15,799
like a dinner on camera or on stream, uh, it's kind of hard to talk and it's kind of hard to,

1441
06:03:16,520 --> 06:03:22,490
but okay, if I were to eat, it takes me probably like at least 15 to 30 minutes to eat dinner.

1442
06:03:23,049 --> 06:03:30,709
So I would have to like go BRB for 30 minutes, maybe 20 to 30 minutes. And I mean, if you're

1443
06:03:30,709 --> 06:03:38,490
talking about people watching the stream, I think you just saw the stream crashed for about

1444
06:03:38,490 --> 06:03:44,409
two minutes and two or 3000 people left. So if I disappeared for 25 minutes,

1445
06:03:44,409 --> 06:03:56,310
how many people would still be here? I wonder. Have dinner with us. Well, that's another thing

1446
06:03:56,310 --> 06:04:04,330
too. Like I don't stream long enough to hit that problem, right? Like, okay, if I have,

1447
06:04:04,330 --> 06:04:07,930
I usually have something before the stream. I usually be like a salad or like a light

1448
06:04:07,930 --> 06:04:11,049
breakfast or something, or like a lunch or something before the stream, which will,

1449
06:04:11,689 --> 06:04:18,680
my streams are only five to six hours, five to seven hours, which that's a decent enough time

1450
06:04:18,680 --> 06:04:22,040
where I don't really need to eat. I have plenty of water and sometimes I'll snack on something,

1451
06:04:23,500 --> 06:04:30,500
but, um, I guess if you're streaming like eight to 12 hours a day, you can't, you have to eat on

1452
06:04:30,500 --> 06:04:36,580
stream. Um, but if you stream less than six hours or seven hours a day, the prospect of kind of

1453
06:04:36,580 --> 06:04:42,819
taking 20, 15 to 20 minutes to eat, um, is like, you're kind of live and I'd rather scream because

1454
06:04:42,819 --> 06:04:50,060
I only stream for five hours or so and I wouldn't want to waste like 30 minutes of that eating food.

1455
06:04:50,060 --> 06:05:18,409
Get it? Don't yell at me, please. I have 90 loyalty, very, very loyal. This time I'm going

1456
06:05:18,409 --> 06:05:23,880
to do, I'm doing it again. We're going heavy, double heavy. I'm messing up the regimen here,

1457
06:05:23,880 --> 06:05:39,209
but I want to do it. I want that 500 intelligence. Bingo. All right. Now we focus on skill and speed.

1458
06:05:39,849 --> 06:06:11,259
Seem like you're the kind of guy that chews ice. Sometimes kind of fun. Depends on how big it is.

1459
06:06:11,819 --> 06:06:32,389
I like chewing a little bit of ice. I need to do a tournament. I'm not constantly doing it.

1460
06:06:32,389 --> 06:06:37,770
If I have a little drink that's, let's say I drink a soda, there's ice in the cup and I get to the

1461
06:06:37,770 --> 06:06:43,529
bottom of the soda and there's three or four little ice crunchies that are as big as little,

1462
06:06:44,330 --> 06:07:01,029
um, like chiclets. I'll just go, I'm not eating ice cubes, almost a hundred loyalty. This is a big

1463
06:07:01,029 --> 06:07:32,299
deal. I'm going to do skill and we'll go back to skill. So what would you guys say is a good

1464
06:07:32,299 --> 06:07:49,529
speed number to be able to hang at a rank? 300, 400, like 350, 450, 400. Oh, the tree's growing.

1465
06:07:49,529 --> 06:08:26,630
Oh, the lore master's left. Is the entire game pretty much just RNG? Um, kind of. It's pretty

1466
06:08:26,630 --> 06:08:36,500
much RNG, but it's fun. I'm going to run out of money. I need to do, all right, I'll do the

1467
06:08:36,500 --> 06:08:54,759
Gemini Cup. We'll rest. Oh yeah. I need to do the monster rancher one thing. Yeah. I'll do that

1468
06:08:54,759 --> 06:09:00,869
before I turn three months, so I don't forget. Does fame do anything? Fame increases your crit

1469
06:09:00,869 --> 06:09:09,299
strike chance. It's the bizarre back of the, in the data of the game code. I don't know why. It's

1470
06:09:09,299 --> 06:09:25,590
just, if your fame is higher, it's tied to your crit chance. Let's get some money. Is this baste

1471
06:09:25,590 --> 06:09:32,889
or fringe? Rotisserie chicken is the best chicken. I would say that's fringe. Bastetake would be

1472
06:09:32,889 --> 06:09:58,860
a, like fried chicken breast for a chicken sandwich. That's pretty fringe. Uh, it's looking

1473
06:09:58,860 --> 06:10:25,189
pretty good. I really need to work on skill. Skill and life. Yeah. I need skill bad. God,

1474
06:10:25,189 --> 06:10:37,159
keep picking this one. That move was not hit once. 74% chance. Am I actually going to lose

1475
06:10:37,159 --> 06:10:59,720
to Millium? I'm going to lose to Millium. Finally. Jesus. There's an update? Is there,

1476
06:10:59,720 --> 06:11:13,740
is this video proof? No, this is not. Don't fucking tell me. Are you serious? I don't see it. I don't

1477
06:11:13,819 --> 06:11:29,909
see it yet. Hold on. I need to show. This is funny. It's not, no, no, no. It's something else. It's

1478
06:11:29,909 --> 06:11:35,590
something else. Something else. It's funny too. Wait, they said so in the discord. I don't see it.

1479
06:11:35,590 --> 06:11:48,970
I need a mod to like vet that video and make sure like it's good if it's real. There's something

1480
06:11:48,970 --> 06:12:29,180
else I want to show. This is so funny. This is like actually me. It's my face. What's wrong with me?

1481
06:12:31,159 --> 06:12:44,970
Yeah, there he is. I just like want to go watch his stream. All right. Do we actually have a video

1482
06:12:44,970 --> 06:12:51,830
update? If we do, then I'm ending the stream because it has to end after that. I'll keep an

1483
06:12:51,830 --> 06:13:18,970
eye on the, on the mods. It's not, it's in the works. I can't, I can't believe it. It's real.

1484
06:13:18,970 --> 06:13:34,099
It's currently in transit. They have to finish rendering it? What do you mean,

1485
06:13:34,099 --> 06:13:44,630
what do you mean rendering it? Cell phone, film, and then send. What do you mean rendering?

1486
06:13:44,630 --> 06:14:00,139
I don't know about this one. I don't know. I'm not so sure about this one. There we go. Double tap.

1487
06:14:00,139 --> 06:14:15,580
You got to be patient. Okay. I'm patient. I'm going to be very patient. I mean, I'll tell you

1488
06:14:15,580 --> 06:14:22,439
what I'm looking for in that video. I'm looking for like a turn the TV off, turn the TV on and

1489
06:14:22,439 --> 06:14:28,860
like from at least three different angles. You know what I mean? Like, like it can't be doctored.

1490
06:14:39,509 --> 06:15:07,020
Unplug the TV. I'm mentally preparing for whatever this is. I want to hit him with this move.

1491
06:15:08,200 --> 06:15:18,520
I don't even know what it looks like. Oh, they might be uploading it to YouTube. What they said,

1492
06:15:18,520 --> 06:15:29,990
rendering. You got to have somebody walking in front of the TV. Oh shit. Like a body crossing

1493
06:15:29,990 --> 06:15:44,119
the plane of the television, right? Oh, it was a joke. Okay. I'm telling you, if I get undeniable

1494
06:15:44,119 --> 06:15:59,029
proof that that's real. Oh my goodness gracious. It's crazy. Part of me thinks that that's just not

1495
06:15:59,029 --> 06:16:17,799
possible. What TV is he talking about? He's talking about this. I never mind. I'm talking.

1496
06:16:17,799 --> 06:16:28,549
I, I, whatever. I thought it was this. I forgot to replace the image with the XQC image. 47 fame.

1497
06:16:35,720 --> 06:17:06,220
Ooh, nice. Very, very good. Very good. XQC is burned into my Nintendo Switch. Somebody said,

1498
06:17:06,220 --> 06:17:13,270
dude, I don't think it's real. They said, I don't think it took years for the Cartoon Network

1499
06:17:13,270 --> 06:17:31,700
logo to get burned into my TV. What? Yeah. What kind of TV do you have? Do you have like a liquid

1500
06:17:31,700 --> 06:17:50,619
crystal plasma TV from like 2002? I'm getting more and more skeptical by the minute. Oh,

1501
06:17:50,619 --> 06:18:15,770
LEDs have burning. I'm freaking out. I got to calm down. Okay. We're good. I'm going to lose my mind

1502
06:18:15,770 --> 06:18:22,680
if it's real. There's a piece of my brain that's like Jeremy. It's not going to be real. So don't

1503
06:18:22,680 --> 06:19:10,810
worry. It's just a joke. Speed. No, skill. I got a message from, uh, I got a message from, from,

1504
06:19:11,529 --> 06:19:21,029
from VR Josh. VR Josh says, Hey, check your DMs. So, uh, it's not real, dude. Uh, it was a Rick roll.

1505
06:19:21,029 --> 06:19:27,819
I'll leave it up to you how you decide to tell everybody. I was about to buy a motherfucker,

1506
06:19:27,819 --> 06:19:44,340
a new plasma TV. All right. I knew it wasn't real. No way. Your TV from like,

1507
06:19:44,419 --> 06:19:59,939
your TV has to be from like 2003. No way. No fucking way. So what the hell? What, where,

1508
06:19:59,939 --> 06:20:07,159
what, where were you? What is the picture? Is that actually your living room and you just doctored

1509
06:20:07,159 --> 06:20:33,099
it? I'm so confused. That's so funny. I want to look at it again. Oh, I thought you wish it was

1510
06:20:33,099 --> 06:20:40,970
real though. Like that's so perfect. The original image. You guys are such fucking jokers. I swear

1511
06:20:40,970 --> 06:20:53,049
to God. The original image is this for those of you that weren't here a few hours ago,

1512
06:20:53,049 --> 06:21:10,810
there's a message in the discord and it said this. Where is it? I'm home for the holidays

1513
06:21:10,810 --> 06:21:13,930
from college. I decided to watch some German. You just, you can read it. I can't read it. It's

1514
06:21:13,930 --> 06:21:25,000
gonna make me laugh. That was a good fake up. That was great. Yeah. Now thinking about it. This is

1515
06:21:25,000 --> 06:21:43,479
way too detailed rendering. Oh yeah. That was pretty good bait though. You had us all rolling.

1516
06:21:43,479 --> 06:21:54,869
You had, you had, you had the whole group fooled for like four hours. That was great. I nominate,

1517
06:21:54,869 --> 06:22:01,930
I nominate that for best one guy of the year. So I'm going to give it a stamp of it's already

1518
06:22:01,930 --> 06:22:10,709
one of them that wins. So it can't get nominated because it's going to win. I was really hoping

1519
06:22:10,709 --> 06:22:18,500
we were going to get a fucking video though. Even if it was fake as shit. Time frame. It probably

1520
06:22:18,500 --> 06:22:26,630
would take a little while. All right. What the hell am I doing here? Official D. I'm going for

1521
06:22:26,630 --> 06:22:52,139
official D. Let's do a little bit more training. Skill. Now I want a big skill. Is there a big

1522
06:22:52,139 --> 06:22:57,580
skill? Power, speed, defense, and intelligence. No, there's not a big skill. We're just going to

1523
06:22:57,580 --> 06:23:05,400
do it this way. What if somebody actually burns your face into their TV on purpose? Well, I talked

1524
06:23:05,400 --> 06:23:11,560
about that earlier. I ain't replacing any TVs. If you go and buy like an old LED TV and you burn

1525
06:23:11,560 --> 06:23:15,479
my face into it and you go, dude, you owe me a thousand bucks for a new TV. I ain't going to

1526
06:23:15,479 --> 06:23:20,599
give it to you. I already talked about it already. That was legitimate. I was going to, I was about

1527
06:23:20,599 --> 06:23:27,299
to have that person contact community Jake to like get that TV and replace it. If you break

1528
06:23:27,299 --> 06:23:30,580
any of your shit and you play, I didn't do it. And I'm telling you right now, I'm not replacing

1529
06:23:30,580 --> 06:23:44,380
it. If you do, let's just make that dead serious clear. Imagine if, imagine if they faked it so

1530
06:23:44,380 --> 06:23:52,970
well that they got like a fucking $1,500 TV out of that. I would think you would have deserved it.

1531
06:23:52,970 --> 06:24:09,349
Yeah. You would deserve it by that point. Absolutely. If a TV has a prize, that effort

1532
06:24:09,349 --> 06:24:15,110
should warrant a new team would have to be warranted a new TV. You got to respect the grift.

1533
06:24:15,669 --> 06:24:23,380
All right. When's the battle after this battle? I'm going to probably, I'm going to take off.

1534
06:24:23,380 --> 06:24:33,450
I'm going to get some food. No, don't intentionally burn a TV. Don't intentionally burn in a TV.

1535
06:24:33,450 --> 06:24:39,700
Don't do that. No, it's this, the bit was funny. The bit was cool, but I don't, I don't want to

1536
06:24:39,700 --> 06:24:45,220
wake up like on Friday afternoon or something. And there's like 30 images in the discord of like

1537
06:24:45,220 --> 06:24:49,619
people burning their TVs. And don't do it. I'm not even going to click them. I'm not, I mean,

1538
06:24:49,619 --> 06:25:04,520
I'm not going to click them. Nope. The joke's over. Joke is over. I need to do mint leaf.

1539
06:25:05,159 --> 06:25:20,520
That's so goddamn funny. Wait, what the fuck are you talking about? You look like you smell salty,

1540
06:25:20,520 --> 06:25:30,979
not dirty, salty, but just straight up like sulfur. I smell like, like the end of a creamed corn can

1541
06:25:30,979 --> 06:25:36,889
when you dump it out and you just go like this and you smell it, which actually smells kind of good.

1542
06:25:48,659 --> 06:25:53,849
Ooh, excellent job. That's going to be at least 10 to 15.

1543
06:25:55,380 --> 06:26:20,229
Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. Let's do it. Official D over to C. I never do that voice again.

1544
06:26:20,229 --> 06:26:32,889
People beg me to do that voice on a monthly basis. I feel great if it drinks from this, really.

1545
06:26:33,529 --> 06:26:46,169
Grandma, can we get one more before the nominations close? That wasn't even nominated. Oh my God.

1546
06:26:46,169 --> 06:27:03,720
That wasn't even a category. What am I thinking? It was, it was. Okay. It was. I don't think it is.

1547
06:27:08,869 --> 06:27:14,950
All right. Adding another category. We're adding it Ooh, category. Last minute category. You have

1548
06:27:14,950 --> 06:27:26,419
two hours to figure it out. It might not even show up. I bet you can't do Toy Boat for one minute.

1549
06:27:50,310 --> 06:27:57,290
One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat. One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat. Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat,

1550
06:27:57,290 --> 06:28:02,729
Toy Boat. Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat,

1551
06:28:02,729 --> 06:28:29,200
Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat

1552
06:28:29,939 --> 06:28:31,939
Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat

1553
06:28:32,759 --> 06:28:43,459
Lost my mojo. How do you spell? I was gonna do a really love

1554
06:28:47,560 --> 06:28:48,419
I

1555
06:28:48,419 --> 06:28:52,209
Could probably do it. No don't need to be nominated. I'll do it. Perfect. I'm never doing it ever again

1556
06:28:52,729 --> 06:28:58,970
I'm gonna get it. Perfect. Just wait

1557
06:28:59,569 --> 06:29:02,709
