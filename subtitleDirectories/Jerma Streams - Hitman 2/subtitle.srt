1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:18,789
Hey, what's going on everybody? How you doing? I am doing good. I apologize for starting on time

2
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:27,429
today. I was gonna start like 20 minutes ago, but I got a text message that I had to respond to.

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,560
I had to talk to somebody really quickly. And what do you have it? How do you know? Here we are.

4
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:47,420
Well, I was texting for 20 minutes. I had to text and I had to do something

5
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:53,560
because of the text that I received. You understand what I'm saying here. Okay,

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,460
give me a second. I'm gonna play Hitman 2 tonight. I'm excited for this game because

7
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,099
the first one was my game of the year when it came out a couple years ago.

8
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,650
And I am so stoked to play this game. I'm so excited for it.

9
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,840
It's gonna be hard. Oh, sorry. It's gonna be a ton of fun.

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,340
As you can tell, I'm fucking excited for it. So, see you guys in a minute. Get a water.

11
00:01:26,299 --> 00:02:22,810
Uh, another Labo stream. No, no, no. Kim and I built the, uh, Kim and I built the jet

12
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,689
with the plane and then I have the submarine that's gonna sit there for a rainy day.

13
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:40,740
So you might see the submarine built six months from now. You never actually go.

14
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,699
You're just sitting there silently watching chat like a creep. That's correct.

15
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,139
That's that's a 100% correct statement. Anytime I tell you guys, oh, I'll be right back in the

16
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,849
grab yourself some drink. I hit the mute button and I stand here. I just sit here and

17
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:10,460
uh-oh here it comes. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I just sit here and stare. First joke of the

18
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,509
night. It's weird because like you guys don't know what I'm doing. I could be doing

19
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:21,900
anything when I hit that mute button, but typically I'll sit there and make sure my

20
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
tweet went through and then I'll stare at chat for a little bit. Well, you know,

21
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,139
because it takes a while for people to realize that there's a stream going on or if they're

22
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:35,099
watching somebody else, maybe they stay there. Maybe they see the notification and get over

23
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:41,699
there quick. Uh, but you know, maybe like 10 minutes. I like to kind of just, just relax,

24
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,000
you know, you know, you could be, you could be watching anyone on Twitch. I don't listen.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,800
You see that J that J nine eight five fucking pop up window in the top right corner

26
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,000
and you go like this and you can't, you do, you miss it like four times because you're like,

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,520
I can't, I have to go now. No, I'm just kidding. That's what I just did.

28
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:23,220
You think way too highly of yourself. I'm just kidding. That's a joke.

29
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,300
If you're new to the stream, we go back and forth both. Hey, if you're new to the stream,

30
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:41,740
welcome to one of the top 1000 Twitch broadcasters. No self-esteem allowed. No,

31
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:49,300
just a, just enough, just enough, right? Cause all my self-esteem is about to go off the window

32
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,019
when I can't find the guy I need to talk to in the first tutorial in the game. You know what

33
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:00,180
I mean? Oh man, like top 1000 Twitch streamer. Okay. Welcome. Okay guys. How are you? I'm

34
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,339
pretty great. And then I'm going to miss a blip and I'm going to drive by the same blip

35
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:10,949
like three times. So like that's probably that. And then I'll be like,

36
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:21,370
yeah. All the confidence just falls off the cliff. No, all jokes aside. Welcome. Have a great day.

37
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:34,459
That's not the button I wanted to press, but still whatever. I've got, I've got a,

38
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,220
I have a stream deck now and it's actually pretty interesting because I can do so much

39
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:47,910
weird shit with it. There we go. Oh, he's really scruffy. He's wearing a wig. Oh,

40
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,310
and by the way, I was able to pause it right at the opening cut scene. So take a look at

41
00:05:52,310 --> 00:06:05,639
that. Wait, I got to make sure everyone's ready. Are you everybody ready? No, not yet. Okay.

42
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:17,579
Okay. I'll wait till you're ready. The story. Were you ready? You guys ready? Okay. So far

43
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:24,870
agent 47 and his handler, Diana Burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ICA

44
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,470
when all of their recent missions turn out to be contracts at Sean Bean client,

45
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,389
things take an unexpected turn. There's revolver also have been operatives in an

46
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,870
invisible organization known as Providence. Providence has infiltrated the highest echelons

47
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:50,699
of power and secretly owns our world. The shadow of Sean Bean wages a silent war against

48
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,899
them. And so the constant Providence is enigmatic controller. You're going to

49
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:03,180
get sick. Track down and eliminate the shadow client. In return, he offers something

50
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,779
irresistible. The truth of 47 lost origins. We don't know where he's from. The man they hunt

51
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:17,740
is 47 childhood friend. It's gonna be really and unlike 47 normal, right? He remembers

52
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,939
everything. Oh, agent 47's past that we did not know before. Nice. He's from Ontario.

53
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:50,980
Whatever. Quebec, actually, but okay. Oh, this looks good. This looks slick. All right. I didn't

54
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,560
like relax. I've been looking forward to this game for a long time, though. Like the first

55
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:06,709
one was so fun. This is actually like runs beautifully. Hold on a second. I need to change

56
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:18,860
this. I'm also keyboard. You're gonna take it's always so high at fucking DPI. Wait,

57
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,220
wait a minute. Hold on. Can I press the DPI button? Oh, I can.

58
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:31,720
Understood. Reynard's house is just up the beach. Our intel indicates that she and her team

59
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,960
are laying low, most likely planning the militia's next strike. Reynard is one of the

60
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,720
shadow clients top lieutenants, and yet she's not a target. Not yet anyway. She's no doubt

61
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,639
high on our client's list. But for now, it's information we seek. Infiltrate the house.

62
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,039
I can't play in the water. I want to go like splash around in the water.

63
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:02,950
On my way. Search the house for Intel on the shadow client. Bones. Dinosaur bones. 47,

64
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:15,220
those are trekkie otopto bones. A land animal from the Jurassic period. This game looks

65
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,620
amazing. Like I'll say it again. Press C to sneak. The first Hitman was my favorite

66
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,580
game to come out a couple years ago. So you have to imagine that it's just more.

67
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:34,549
All right, so we get to sneak into the penthouse. I'm gonna get Intel. Is this how the UI is?

68
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:42,779
All right, I just sneak around in the grass. And if there's a brick, I'm throwing a brick

69
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:51,159
through the window. Control is the instinct. Okay, we've got a diaper up there, a diaper

70
00:09:51,159 --> 00:10:03,929
over there. Depends on which diaper I want to use. Okay, I mean, that's a security camera.

71
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,840
I definitely don't want to walk in front of the security camera. Why go in here and

72
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,639
rob this guy or kill this guy or whatever? I could just come here every day and just watch

73
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:24,470
whatever movie he's watching. I could bring my whole family out here and we could just call

74
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,919
his house and inception shit into his head. If we wanted to watch Infinity War tonight,

75
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:36,200
bring the whole family out here. Just call them. Be like, oh yeah, sir, this is your

76
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,360
credit card company. We didn't want to make sure that we declined that purchase that you

77
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,240
made of the rental of Infinity War, one of the top movies of one of the top movies of 2018.

78
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,559
I just want to make sure and highly rated too. Do you want to accept those charges? Are you

79
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,879
sitting down tonight? Are you in front of your couch? Oh, fuck, dude, I want to accept those

80
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:10,440
charges. And then we like all sit down and we just watch. Okay, well, here's I guess I

81
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:20,919
can stop crouching. Equip your pistol. I and then enter. Sorry, I had to. All right,

82
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:40,039
destroy camera. I want to. There we go. It's broken. Oh, that feels clean.

83
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:50,500
That didn't destroy it. Got it. Good day. Now, according to the local home security provider,

84
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,700
the house is equipped with multiple cameras around the perimeter. I suggest you get rid of

85
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:26,330
them. But I can't. I don't want to do that. Oh, I guess. Come on. I got it. I think that

86
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:40,940
should be it. That's the that's the last camera, I think. Right. Got that one. Okay.

87
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:51,139
There's a couple of options. There's one over here. And I already saw them. I'm so excited

88
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:58,149
to play this game. Can you tell? Hey, can you tell guys? There's one over there too.

89
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,529
Can I get that long range? Check this to I'm so good at everything.

90
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:24,840
At everything. Okay, we got we got a screwdriver. In this case, we need it.

91
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:42,460
That's me. That's me. Okay. Yeah, guys. I'm so good at everything, even though I can't

92
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,299
even determine what my own reflection is. Alright, search the house into holstering,

93
00:13:49,299 --> 00:14:08,200
holster an item. All right, you look at the Intel. Oh, you gotta love that noise.

94
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:23,940
They thought of everything. All right, open door G. I can't I'm actually able to go key

95
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:34,250
use the key missing. Okay, I need a key. We tend to keep looking around here for Intel.

96
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:50,039
Smash the door. Wait a minute Intel short circuit with the run over your garage.

97
00:14:50,279 --> 00:15:02,230
You take your garage door opener. There we go. What's all this? What is aiming down here?

98
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,009
Is it a disco ball? Or is this something I need to pay attention to?

99
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:46,980
All right, G. Oh, 30s. Executed. I see them. Bastards. Looks like Reynard's grizzly

100
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,259
handiwork. All right. He was never shy about collateral damage. The owners don't think so.

101
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,460
The house is registered to a non-existing environmental NGO. This feels more like identity

102
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:03,460
theft. Like you, Reynard is known to use disguises. Toy, I'm dealing with another 47.

103
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:12,440
Nothing we can do for these people now. Okay, I got Intel f1. Murder victims. A deceased couple

104
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,519
of people have been discovered in the garage and the cause of death appears to be execution.

105
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,559
There it didn't. We just she just told us all these. She just told us everything.

106
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,259
All right, search the house for Intel. We've got some stuff to look at here. I don't like,

107
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:36,659
I don't like G. Masks, rope, chloroform. Looks like another kidnapping. I wouldn't put it past

108
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,620
them. I think I'll test it to see if it works. If not industrious. Why is he doing this?

109
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,100
Clearly he has an axe to grind with Providence. Big enough to surround himself

110
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,740
with murderers and terrorists. Big enough not to care who gets hurt in the process.

111
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,259
He believes he's doing the right thing, I suppose. Just like everyone else. Diana,

112
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:11,299
if I stop talking, I drank too much chloroform. Tell my son his trush fund password is 1-1-1-1.

113
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:30,569
Why am I doing all this? Um, oh, these all work. I'm just a maintenance guy testing QA.

114
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:39,049
I can't unlock. Why am I holding a car battery? I don't know. I need a lockpick.

115
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:48,170
We got, uh, expired can of spaghetti sauce. And you can spaghetti sauce people. This might be

116
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:54,579
the best game ever. You know what I'm saying? Like, all I want is to be able to spaghetti sauce

117
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,619
people in the head. Like, that's all I want. It's the only thing I've ever wanted in a

118
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:15,509
video game. And apparently it's here. Do I need this? Ooh, what's on TV today?

119
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:27,460
Oh, we got, looks like the window blinds. Oh, yeah, turn them off. Make sure nobody can see in here.

120
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:45,319
Piano. Close them all. Oh, this is the other side of the window. What do we got? Intel.

121
00:18:49,049 --> 00:19:17,240
Phone ringing. Bathroom ventilation system. What a weird sink. Oh god, it actually works!

122
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:27,269
What? Holy shit, your sink sucks. Uh, can you come and fix the sink instead? Because I just

123
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:33,460
turned my water on and within five seconds my whole bathroom flooded. The design of that

124
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,470
sink is not good. What about the shower? Is it actually going to fill the whole place?

125
00:19:41,269 --> 00:20:08,900
Let's do it! What the fuck? Hold on, so you can, you can like throw a toaster and you...

126
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:17,509
Okay, that's fucking ridiculous. 47, I'm trying to find Intel. Diana,

127
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,740
Intel on the criminal. I don't know that throwing a car battery while standing in water

128
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,279
is a bad idea. Eat shit!

129
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:53,349
Wait, did somebody just say frame rate? Are we losing frames? It's fine? It's all right?

130
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:01,509
Okay, it should be somewhere close to 60. All right, let's go. Well, that's,

131
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:07,430
that's an indication of what's to come. This already is my favorite game of the year.

132
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,910
That's all it took. Seriously.

133
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:29,420
No, I can't, I can't just do this. No, I can't! I have to get out of here. Can I get in

134
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:54,410
the bathtub and turn the water on? I don't think I can. No, I can't get it now. Got it. I just have

135
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:03,539
to sneak and get it. All right, is there anything else? He says the bathroom ventilation system,

136
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:11,180
he said, was fucked up, right? I don't even, I need this key. I gotta go in like his bedroom.

137
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:24,359
It's a nice house. Curt, I can just, can I hide in here or is this... Okay. I'm sorry

138
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:31,099
I'm taking so long doing this. I'm just, I just love this game. Okay, found the bedroom.

139
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:40,250
I don't know, I think maybe I shouldn't close up blinds. There's a lot of places to,

140
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:49,700
holy shit. All right, settle down. What have we got? A drink, glass of whiskey.

141
00:22:50,339 --> 00:23:11,220
I don't even know whose this is. Oh my god, really? Like, this, there's so many things. It's

142
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,640
like a dead rising, the amount of random things you can just pick up here. Okay, did I miss

143
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:34,890
anything? Let's go this way. All right, there's a computer over there. Wait, camera. No,

144
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:43,859
I already got it. I can't get through this door. All right, I need to get to that computer.

145
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:57,240
All right, this way. Uh, I didn't look over this way though. Let's check the other side.

146
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,420
Uh, there is a bench over here. I don't know what this has anything to do with Intel,

147
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:19,099
but I have it. Oh, what's this? Coin. Why is it all the way out here? Blend in.

148
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,380
All right, I'm sorry guys, but like, if somebody happens to be swimming in the

149
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,809
ocean right now, I'm sorry. You know what I'm saying? But it's going to happen. I'm sorry.

150
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:48,359
I just electrocuted everybody that was in the ocean. I'm playing Hitman though. I had to

151
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:54,599
test it. What's this? Fire poker. Oh, more tools to fucking go crazy with upstairs. Wait.

152
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,190
Yeah. Think of all the fish. That's like, that's like 600 million fish that I just

153
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,789
fried right there. So you can see even the bird, like all the fish coming out.

154
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:10,569
They're like getting fried and flying up in the air. See, those are those are fish

155
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,450
that are fucking flying out of the ocean. Cause the electricity is just everywhere.

156
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:37,579
This looks like something I can do here. Maybe not. What about with this? Can I like

157
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:53,509
break this thing? Poison. The panic room ventilation. Uh, I'm just fucking up this

158
00:25:53,509 --> 00:26:01,210
guy's whole house. I'm poisoning every inch of this guy's house. Poisoning. Hey,

159
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,609
your panic room, your whiskey. Where is this person? All right. That's okay. Panic room

160
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:20,259
ventilation. That's, this is the bathroom up here. This is solar panels. Okay. So the real

161
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:28,140
question is how do I get to the room with the computer? Cause this brings me back here. I need

162
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:41,430
to get in there. I think it wasn't already in there. Unlock the door. Come on. Can't pick the

163
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:57,339
lock. Crowbar. Can't break it open. Where's my quick like weapon wheel? Go into the panic

164
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:11,990
room and breathe heavily. God damn it. Do I not? I don't know. I thought I had a crowbar.

165
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:25,109
I did before. Where is it? No, it's a lead pipe wrench screwdriver. I can't unlock the

166
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:38,680
screwdriver. Did I lock myself out of the house? How did I lock myself out of the house?

167
00:27:42,329 --> 00:28:01,160
Did I press a button and lock the doors? All right. Well, this is, I was already here.

168
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:10,900
I like went through this whole house already. Go to the garage. What the hell is their garage?

169
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:31,220
How did I, how did I do this? What do you mean the garage? What, what's in the garage?

170
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:43,190
The most, yeah, I, I know the moment the dead people, but did I like fuck up the whole

171
00:28:43,190 --> 00:29:32,660
house? I can't unlock this either. Stop. Stop it. All right. Computer. This thing's got

172
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:46,619
to drive me crazy. I'm going to go upstairs. This is going to drive me crazy. 47, that computer.

173
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:55,779
Got the computer. Can't access it. Encrypted. Assuming there's a key,

174
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:02,099
Reina wouldn't just leave it lying around. Wait, according to the floor plan,

175
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,660
the room you're in should be a lot bigger. Okay. Might be a concealed space behind the wall.

176
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:24,950
Check the hidden panels. 47. She's still talking out there. Alexa. Alexa. Alexa, stop. Alexa.

177
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:46,059
Play season one of house. MD. Got it. This should be interesting. Panic room. Oh, oh,

178
00:30:46,059 --> 00:31:05,619
wait, hold on. This is the panic room. Should I not be in there? All right. I'm ready.

179
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:21,829
Nicely done. 47. Password dongle. To move more freely. Here we go.

180
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:31,930
For the office computer, no doubt. What about this one? Okay. See, I unlocked the shortcut.

181
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,170
Kidnapping plan. It appears Reynald's cell is launching another strike. There's a sewer

182
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,809
house of a residential area in Wellington. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.

183
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:52,970
Our priority is the shadow client. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone just relax.

184
00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:13,180
Okay. Back up to the... I'm sorry, Alexa, but you made me do this.

185
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:39,900
Where are you, Alexa? Thank God. Until they work the bugs out. They'll send me another one.

186
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,339
I'm detecting movement up the road. A motorcade. Possibly Reynald's. Uploading the data. Hold on.

187
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:53,900
Receiving it now. Nothing on the shadow client or the other cells. No names. No aliases.

188
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,759
I doubt she even knows whom she's working for. Wait. Here's something.

189
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,200
A message from Robert Knox of Cronstadt Industries. And by the sound of it...

190
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,119
Crunk. Crunk. Crunk. A defector. Well, well, well. Client won't like this one bit.

191
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:17,880
And you can't wait to tell him. They're back. Hostiles. I see them. Damn. Here we go.

192
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Okay. We've got all we're going to get. Go to stage two, 47. Stage two. Eliminate Reynald,

193
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,960
and preferably without raising suspicion. One step ahead of the shadow client.

194
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,359
What about the grenade I threw in his living room? Let's keep it that way.

195
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,210
Oh. This guy walks in. Alexa. Alexa two and Alexa three.

196
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:38,809
What a snob. Where's my trio of Alexas?

197
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,509
You didn't even miss out on the action. I'm sorry you had to endure all that free

198
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:48,470
champagne and cello music, Orson. What can I say? You really took one for the team.

199
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,789
Well, I say stick to what you know.

200
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,139
Drag me out into the street and shoot me.

201
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,949
I'm equalizing, guys. I want to make it like it's like John Wick 3. That's going to happen.

202
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:31,300
There's going to be a huge fight and John Wick is going to run out of bullets. And then the

203
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,940
antagonist is going to run out of bullets. And then there's going to be like a pipe on

204
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,260
the ground and like a butter knife on the like right next to him. He's like a restaurant.

205
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:47,980
And he's going to be like, hey, you out? Yeah, I'm out. Huh. What do you say we do this

206
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,510
the old fashioned way? He's going to throw the butter knife over like this.

207
00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:06,150
How do you throw harder? Go and see what it is.

208
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:26,150
How do you? I want to throw it harder. Oh, come on. Oh, that don't work.

209
00:35:26,230 --> 00:36:07,239
All right. All right. Okay. Still one of their cars. Silent takedown for that. What? Oh,

210
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:30,699
this isn't this is not the simulator. I'm currently concealed. What's with that blur?

211
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:41,210
Game really does not want me to be over here. That was a really good silent explosion.

212
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:58,949
Body found. Oh, no. Come on. I got silent kill. What's this blurry shit? Am I game broken?

213
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:11,000
How do I like? Oh, oh, fuck. Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I didn't even need to do that.

214
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:22,789
This is so far away. Have discovered your boat 47. They're on high alert,

215
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:44,170
combing the beach for intruders. I skipped this whole mission. Well, I did it. Wait,

216
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,769
this guy turns around. Should I squeak? Should I kill this guy with a squeaky toy?

217
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,010
Can I squeak it? I wish I could just press a button and have it go like,

218
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:24,010
oh, man, my game's actually kind of running like shit. Oh, right. Squeaky toy assassin

219
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:30,409
kill here. Squeaky toy kill. I'm going to stuff it down his throat. See it's in his mouth.

220
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:50,760
Still got it in my hands. No way to get past them unnoticed. I suggest you cause a

221
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,119
distraction. 47. I'm gonna have to like turn something off. A distraction. Okay. I can do

222
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:15,349
that. No, I can't. Right. Loud. Squeaky toys a lot. The thing just exploded. Shit. All right.

223
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:33,739
Hold on. Let me like turn off a couple of settings. I don't think I can. Super sampling.

224
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:44,420
Level of detail. Texture quality. 1080. Let's turn that off. Ambient occlusion.

225
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:57,000
How's that do? That feels a lot better. Holy shit. This game with the ambient occlusion

226
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,050
on just, just kills my frames. Well, nevermind. It's back. All right. Here we go.

227
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,889
Uh, I, I'm just going to throw a coin. Does it, will it make a loud noise on the,

228
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:14,280
no, hold on a minute. It's like, dude, I'm not doing something over there. Watch this.

229
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,659
Okay. Here we go. Got one. Well, he looked like he was about to look.

230
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:30,940
What if I just go over here? Will they see me if I do this?

231
00:40:31,420 --> 00:41:39,139
Hey, you'll want to have a look. Guys. All right. Well, there it is. Flawless.

232
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:55,030
Hey, they said make a loud distraction. Excellent work. 47. Ooh. Suit only. Mastermind.

233
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,500
Don't tread on me. Discover a hawks Bay. So that's interesting. You can see, you could do

234
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:06,809
I saw. Okay. There's a lot of things I could do there besides the role of grenade in front

235
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:33,980
of her. All right. Well, that was funny. That was fun. I just got to, I'm, I'm streaming it

236
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,780
at 60 FPS right now and playing at 60 FPS. That might not, that might not be a good idea.

237
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:48,460
I might have to tone it down a little. I got one star on the tutorial. Yeah. Cause

238
00:42:48,460 --> 00:43:08,710
I threw a grenade three times in somebody's living room. So here's the interesting thing

239
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,989
about, uh, numbering your games and redoing them and redoing them and making new sequels

240
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:19,610
and sequels and sequels. The client has given us carte blanche hunt down the militia

241
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,329
30 years from now. How many hitman twos in the building? Providence was a threat.

242
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:30,570
How did you swing the board? The board of practical people. 47, a blank check.

243
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:36,090
What are the four hitman twos? The shadow clients war on Providence is causing a global

244
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:42,409
panic. Someone will need to stop the militia might as well be us. And the man on the

245
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:53,059
train taking a contract for personal gain is against ICA regulations. She's supposed

246
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,019
to be targeting sodas would have been proud. Oh no, I thought I had a broken game. It's just

247
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:06,059
a whatever next crying at the movies. Why are you doing this? I know what it's like to have

248
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:12,489
everything. I know what it's like to lose claims to know about your past, your childhood,

249
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:18,699
your memories, everything. Old Maya stole from you and you trust him about as far as I can

250
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:25,500
throw him. But this is our best lead in 20 years. I say it's time we break a few rules.

251
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:36,730
I mean, I'm not going to give deduct points for that. I mean, honestly, in a game like

252
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:42,170
this, do you really matter if it's like a cinematic kind of like comic book style

253
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:48,300
cinematic? Like that's a lot of development times, a lot of animation, like spend the money on like

254
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:57,539
throwing bricks at people. You know what I mean? Like they did. We can see you haven't

255
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:00,500
completed your training. We recommend that you complete advanced agent training before

256
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:08,139
continuing the story. Okay, fine. I'll do my homework. I also have to walk around a

257
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:19,429
little bit and make sure that I can stream this at 60. But it's just the training from

258
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:27,780
the first game. Oh, is it really? Oh, damn it is. But let me just make sure it wasn't

259
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,539
just that level. Welcome to the agent program. This is running fine. I'll be waiting for you

260
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:53,929
inside. Follow the lines. Okay, how do I leave? What the hell is going on right now?

261
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:59,510
Pro tip it hit man and then hit man too. Is it? Do they have the other game in here?

262
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:12,739
Really? Hold on a second. So you get the first all the episodes from the first game,

263
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:16,260
the second game and then this other little campaign for one for the same price.

264
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,800
Oh, okay. If you own it already. Okay. All right. Like I was gonna say, holy shit.

265
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,239
All right. So we got blank check and then here's the first mission finish line.

266
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:43,000
Good afternoon, 47. Your destination is the annual global innovation motor race in Miami,

267
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,159
Florida. That would've been crazy. After analyzing the data from Reynard's computer,

268
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,119
the case is clear. The providence defectors are Robert and Sierra Knox,

269
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:59,880
head of robotics, developer Cronstadt industries, a visionary inventor and technological innovator.

270
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,079
Robert Knox has spearheaded Cronstadt. That's not a very good food for him.

271
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,880
Where's the whole grain is equally. Not only a financial wizard, but also

272
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,960
a fiercely competitive race car driver with a fiery temper to match

273
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,760
it.

274
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,190
Cronstadt.

275
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,190
BBA.

276
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:37,929
Last year, despotic ruler Jin Po employed prototype Cronstadt drones against peaceful

277
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:43,449
civilian protesters in the now infamous Tungan Valley incident. And although it has yet to be

278
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:49,929
proven, there is little doubt that the Knox's personally broke the deal, making them complicit

279
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:58,619
in a war crime. It is unclear why the Knox's would betray their masters, but likely the fear

280
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:03,260
of being next on the shadow clients hit list has pressured them to cut a deal with the enemy.

281
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:08,940
Undoubtedly with Cronstadt industries on their side, the militia will increase their attacks

282
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:15,099
tenfold. And so our contract obligates us to retire Robert and Sierra Knox and contain

283
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:19,579
the damage they may inflict on Providence. I believe you.

284
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:40,179
So let's take a look. Objectives. Let's just see. Target Sierra Knox. Eliminate using any

285
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:44,980
method and you can wear any disguise. Kill conditions and intel. We don't really have much.

286
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:53,059
She suffers from inferiority conflicts in relation to her father. Highly invested in the Cronstadt

287
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:58,980
racing team and is the company's lead driver. Okay, so this is the driver. And then we got

288
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:08,139
Robert Knox. Any method, any disguise. Let's see, let's pick out one because technical

289
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:12,539
skills and reputation catch the attention of a powerful group of people. The race's CEO

290
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:15,820
killings Knox feels the ground burning beneath his feet and so makes another bold

291
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,500
life decision. He contacts the terrorists through a dark web connection and offers him a deal.

292
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:27,989
And you spare him to get the digital keys to his Warcraft account. All right, planning.

293
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:33,909
Smuggled item. What do we got? Complete additional challenges to unlock. So this

294
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:39,130
is the only place I can put it and I don't, do I have anything? What do I want to put

295
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:50,389
in here? Pistols. I mean, the pale duck. There's an explosive duck in the game. Suit.

296
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:57,539
Florida suit. All right, yeah. And start of the event. We're just gonna do it the

297
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:05,880
way that it's supposed to be done. So difficulty. Professional. Assassination is serious business.

298
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,079
You plan, you execute, you escape, and your handler is right there giving you the guidance

299
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,159
you need to succeed. Unlimited saves. All mission story guides available. Surveillance

300
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:17,159
cameras active. Cameras alert. Guards have illegal activity. Spotted combat is challenging

301
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:26,599
but fair. That's fine. I'm not doing master. The missions in Hitman can be solved in

302
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:29,800
countless ways. One approach is to uncover some of the many missions stories and follow

303
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,239
them through. When you uncover a mission story, you will have an opportunity to get

304
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,920
help and guidance. Since this is your first time in Miami, you may choose to have a

305
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:46,869
guide active from the get-go. I don't think I'm, I don't think I need to do that. No,

306
00:50:46,869 --> 00:51:00,579
it's uncovered. I don't want a guide. This is how the other game worked. You kind of

307
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:04,900
stumble upon objectives and intel and you can choose to act on it or not, right?

308
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:16,650
You kind of just have to walk around and look at stuff. This is a great intro

309
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:21,849
to like a real estate infomercial. The innovation race is on its last day

310
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:27,659
and it is down to the wire. Thousands of eager fans are gathered for the final

311
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:34,219
lapse of this unexpectedly close race. Sierra Knox is expertly piloting her red

312
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:40,780
Kronstadt car. Her father, Robert Knox, roams the nearby Expo building where Kronstadt

313
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:46,619
is showcasing its new prototype car. Cool balloons. The Kronstadt RK Mark III has

314
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:51,260
seen fierce competition from the Chinese Kaowoon Heavy Industries new racer.

315
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,260
Moses Lee, CEO of Kaowoon, has taken a dominant lead. Can I drive?

316
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,619
There's like endless amounts of things I want to do here.

317
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:35,670
Is this just a CEO race? Oh man. Eliminate Sierra Knox, eliminate Robert Knox.

318
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:40,300
What are you doing, Otto? What's the matter?

319
00:52:43,050 --> 00:53:08,179
Okay, so I mean I see the guy in the mascot suit. I'm out of here. Who is that?

320
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,860
Don't ever hand me a pantslet again. All right, hold on. Otto, what's the matter?

321
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:32,440
No, don't load that. Just replay. Here, please go throw away this card.

322
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:38,679
Yeah, I know. I understand. It's like just, you know, have a big sign with all your info

323
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:43,480
on it, right? People hand out pamphlets and, how do I skip this? There you go.

324
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:49,320
Like people hand out pamphlets and, oh here's this. Take this. No, just stand next to a

325
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,360
giant sign and have it say, add a funny Snapchat filter if you take a picture in

326
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:06,650
front of the sign. Pamphlets, people just throw them away. What do we got here? Wire.

327
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:16,230
So the Global Innovation Race is a major sporting event taking place in Miami every year

328
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,230
besides the endurance race itself, which runs over the course of two days. The social aspect

329
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,829
of the race has exploded over the years, going from being mostly an enthusiast event,

330
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,070
it's now a major public event complete with exclusive areas for VIPs.

331
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,030
Okay, the exclusive driver's lounge features nightly parties and often sees the attendance

332
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,500
of various celebrities. So here's the driver's lounge and here's the entrance. So the

333
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,300
driver's lounge is to the right. Okay, interesting intel. Give me a second. I have

334
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,460
bring Otto downstairs because I think he might have to pee. So give me one second, I'll be right

335
00:54:46,460 --> 00:57:53,639
back. All right, I'm gonna need to run back down there in just a minute. Let's grab something.

336
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:05,530
But anyways, okay, so here's the entrance. Welcome. Oh, no, I have no items. Okay,

337
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,469
that's fine. Why do I have to, I don't have to wait in line.

338
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:15,860
Okay, thank you, sir. This will be over in no time. Why do I have to wait in line?

339
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,219
Okay, let's go, sir. Thank you. All right.

340
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:38,619
Oh, man, this is wild. Can I take this car? Free photo shoot. Blending into the crowd. Yeah,

341
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:48,099
I mean, this is so accurate. This is just too accurate. They have those like monster

342
00:58:48,179 --> 00:59:00,570
boots. Goodbye, man. Grab a can. Photo. Intel item. Let's see it. Flamingo mascot Polaroid. A

343
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:11,860
Polaroid picture of one of the race mascots dressed as a flamingo. Okay, just blending in.

344
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:21,239
So where are they? Well, there's the flamingo. Hold on. Let me see the flamingo. I have to

345
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:27,320
do the flamingo thing. You know what I mean? How could I not do the like Mario

346
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:42,469
card character? I need to like follow this guy around. He's all the way over there. She's

347
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:50,699
in the race, right? She's in the car. Hold on. I'm going to save it. Let's start a new slot

348
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:57,340
here because I'm not starting from the very beginning. I just want to look. So here's the

349
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:14,139
track. My god, this is so much. I want to get a good view. French fries, hamburgers.

350
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:24,380
How can I not do the Mario card character? I know. How much more is there? These outhouses.

351
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:31,530
Can I actually go see the track? Her car's out there.

352
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:36,019
Where does it come across? It comes across right here. Holy shit.

353
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:50,039
Wow. Wow. Can I be a crazy fan and like rush to like go run over there?

354
01:00:54,949 --> 01:01:13,130
This race sucks. I can't jump over that. I can see. Hold on. There's a way over here.

355
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:26,090
Oh, there's a. Hold on. Let me just get a look. Police car down here. Exit. There's

356
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:38,699
got to be a way to get on the track, right? Okay. I'm not supposed to be in here.

357
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,820
All right. Parking. No, it's definitely not down here. It might be though.

358
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:56,090
Parking is the exit. No, let's try this way. I'm going to have to sneak through here up

359
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:07,269
and around. Yeah, I'm going to start over and do it again. I just need to see if I

360
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:21,829
can get over there. Oh, Jesus. No, I can't push them. All right. I'm going to put this on.

361
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:35,530
No, there's no cars to push them to do. Oh, they knew you were going to try to do it,

362
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:43,260
didn't they? They knew it. They put these barriers up here. Bastards. They put the

363
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:55,480
barriers. Oh, that's too bad. Dump. No, I want to dump them. If I'm going to dump

364
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:13,449
them, I'm dumping them like into the road. I might be able to do it. That's pretty close.

365
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:24,570
If it gets done correctly, I seem to wait for the one. Psycho. All right. Can I throw

366
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:32,579
them over though? That's the question. Nobody else on the other side here. There's people up

367
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:55,860
there. Dump. Okay. I'm going to wait for the next pass. And how about right now? Shit.

368
01:03:56,659 --> 01:04:11,780
No, maybe I can get down there from here. Holy shit. There he is. Where's the guy?

369
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:24,760
That is Robert Knox. Genius inventor. Black market weapons to knocks down.

370
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,199
Now for the heir to the Kronstadt empire. All right. All right. All right. Which car is she?

371
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:43,369
I don't have any items. No. All right. Let's load it. Let's go back. I don't think I can

372
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:50,780
get over there. Let's try and do like an actual scenario. That's too bad. I wish I could

373
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:56,869
just like stand in the road. You probably can somewhere down there maybe. But let's like

374
01:04:56,869 --> 01:05:01,559
actually try. I want to let's let's try to get some intel on the fucking bird person

375
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:09,460
brought to you by guardian. You got an imitation there, sir? Nope. I've got so much pure energy

376
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:18,469
though. All right. Here he goes. So he can go through the VIP access. We need to watch

377
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:29,110
and see what he does. I need to complain about this. This is bullshit. No, no, no.

378
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:34,730
Go get Chris. Go. You go get Chris and tell him I'm out here. Sir. I don't know who Chris

379
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:40,820
is. Chris is like he's here at the party right now. Go get him. I just I just work security

380
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:45,159
detail man. I don't know what you're talking about. I want you to call Chris. He's the

381
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:55,110
DJ's friend and he's in there. All right. What was I doing? Oh yeah. I want to try.

382
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:59,349
Oh I got I got to run back downstairs. One second. I will be actually one second this

383
01:05:59,349 --> 01:07:29,610
time. Give me one sec. Okay. Sorry about that. I wanted to make another cup of coffee

384
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:36,230
because I'm having a fucking blast. Let's do it. All right. So I need to find the

385
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:43,050
I need to find the unlockable Mario Kart character. Meet the drivers. Hold on.

386
01:07:43,050 --> 01:08:01,960
Complementary beverages. Yeah. Sorry dude. Leg up. In fact, fuck out of the way.

387
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:12,869
My turn next. What did you say? Do you see what I'm drinking dude? It's a noxious

388
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:30,119
energy. Hey dude. Can you sign my noxious fuel can? Such a big fan man. Hey I'm gonna

389
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:37,750
get a tattoo of you on my ass tonight. Can I get a pic bro? Fuck. My walnut desk.

390
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:51,500
Do we get a fake news thing here?

391
01:08:52,220 --> 01:09:10,390
It's literally it's literally my turn. Okay. So hey bro. Can you sign my scissors dude?

392
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:28,710
I got him. I got him. I can't believe I got him. He signed him. Oh I am never

393
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:39,500
going to get anything done. Oh I'm never gonna get anything done. It's not good. I'm

394
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,779
gonna have to say this is gonna be like playing an emulator with save states everywhere.

395
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,579
I already love this game. There's already so all right so I want to like get the uh

396
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:57,619
where do I want to go? I feel like I'm at Disneyland right now. There's a bunch of rides

397
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:05,140
to get on. I just don't know which ride I want to get on. Can I do anything over here?

398
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:19,020
Oh Jesus. Furt Fernandez just gave 10 community subs. Thank you Furt. That's a

399
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:26,970
lot of subs. Here comes Tim Allen for about at least a straight minute. Thank you so much man.

400
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:44,020
Okay. What's over here? Nothing over here. All right I gotta let me I gotta figure it out what

401
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:58,739
I want to do. I think I want to follow the flamingo. So the flamingo meet the driver is

402
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:09,449
that. I think flamingo comes over here. Do I have any like any intel on the bird? No I

403
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:23,939
just have a picture of him. He comes out he dances out here. If I go this way. The true

404
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:31,300
target. The bird. So there's a bathroom. I can go over there. Let me see. Just let me walk

405
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:45,930
around again. It's a parking lot. Let's go down to the parking lot. Parking. Stands. Tunnel.

406
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:58,090
All right. We've got some options here. You've been caught by a camera.

407
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,340
I think I need another one of these. Fountain view.

408
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:22,060
Did I just get some intel?

409
01:12:23,449 --> 01:12:27,800
Yeah.

410
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:47,989
Excuse me but it really freaks me out when people stand too close to me.

411
01:12:47,989 --> 01:13:01,720
All right. Unlock the door. That door's locked. Kill employees only. All right there's a camera

412
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:10,199
up there. Whoa that just drove. Whoa what the fuck was that? That was loud. All right what

413
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:20,020
we got here? Oh we've got event area key. We've also got got a race martial disguise

414
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:35,300
and a crowbar. That's all that's in here I think right? Put this away. Conceal item is another

415
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:43,529
restroom. Oh this is the one I was just in. All right. Um let me go over here because now I

416
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:49,529
have all this stuff that I need. Let me save it. And I'm gonna also uh no I'm gonna save

417
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:56,569
it here because this that's the beginning. I need to do this too unfortunately. Roof down

418
01:13:56,649 --> 01:14:11,340
like times two. What's my memory at right now? Not that bad. Okay let's just head back up.

419
01:14:15,029 --> 01:14:22,920
So ugly now. I mean I got. It's all good. All right so here we go.

420
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:34,460
There he is. There he is. There he is. Nothing matters. Okay.

421
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:39,739
Look at the documents from my van.

422
01:14:47,260 --> 01:15:08,869
Really? All right I gotta put him somewhere. I got the flamingo outfit. Where can I bring you though?

423
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:21,859
That's so great. I had to knock a guy out. What does flamingo call? All right I can't drag him

424
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:39,529
over here. Does anybody actually walk down this path? They might not. Let's put him in the

425
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:51,800
shadow over here. Oh he's gonna wake up too. What's in here? I don't want to be walking

426
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,479
around with this. Slot machines. All right I got my parking ticket so I need my.

427
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:01,000
Let's take a look here. I got. Looks like someone illegally parked a beat up gray van

428
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:13,619
with a rusty green sliding door in the basement garage. In what slot is that in? I didn't tell.

429
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:19,859
So this is citation uh under the Cronstate Bayside Center beat up gray van illegally parked.

430
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:30,260
So does it say what D A B I guess. I'm looking for a beat up gray van. Let's just take a look.

431
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:36,380
That's not a van. That's not a gray van.

432
01:16:47,100 --> 01:17:15,689
Gray van. No there it is. I can't holster it. Oh well. Place what? Oh hello. So break open.

433
01:17:15,689 --> 01:17:20,630
I don't need to break open. I have the keys don't I? Did I not? Do I not have the guy's

434
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:37,529
keys? Hmm about this side. Oh yeah he lost his keys. Um I mean I could try it see what happens

435
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:54,819
here. Or maybe I should just throw something. Save it right here. No no no I want to just.

436
01:17:54,819 --> 01:18:11,220
I mean kidding me. All right go get it. Either we got a poltergeist

437
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:30,949
or someone's throwing things at me. Oh god. Uh yeah hey. Clear here. So I dropped this sorry.

438
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,869
I just fell out of my pocket on the way up back here. Thanks for that.

439
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:06,100
The race is entering its final lap. Final lap? Final lap? Oh no that's fine. That's fine. All

440
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:10,359
right I got it. A pile of Cronstate documents that looks like they might be useful to an

441
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:15,079
investigative journalist or blackmailer. A note attached the document reads Sierra Knox

442
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:21,670
after the race next to the hotel. Bring documents be the flamingo. After the race

443
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:29,109
next to the hotel. All right I gotta find the hotel. Where's the exit? Okay this is fine.

444
01:19:29,109 --> 01:19:46,220
Hotel. Uh I got. Do I have a map? Do I have a map? How do I open the map? M? M didn't do

445
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:52,060

It was a huge fucking map. I just gotta get out to like above ground here.

448
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:21,930
That's the flamingo. The flamingo just woke up. All right here's the center. Let's go through here.

449
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:34,310
Hey all right uh screwdriver. Race is in its final lap right now.

450
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:41,699
So where the hell am I going? Is this gonna take me up? It should take me up and out

451
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:49,479
to where though? Right here. So here's the event entrance. Now where is hotel?

452
01:20:50,680 --> 01:21:06,409
Agency pick up. Robert Knox. She is not there. I mean this might be it. 47 the race is over.

453
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:13,670
Okay. Sierra will be coming off the track anytime now. Mission story updated. All right

454
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:19,289

455
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:26,729
My street circuit. Bayside Center entrance. I guess I could just follow her around.

456
01:21:29,909 --> 01:21:34,550
Wait where? Hey and make sure to eat your front loops kids.

457

01:21:54,100 --> 01:22:03,020
Oh man. She is so far away. I gotta run there. You know how hot this would be in this suit?

460
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:16,899
Look at how many different things there are. Parking. Oh boy. She's far. I don't want to

461
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:27,180
go through there again. I'm overheating right now on this thing. Wait am I allowed to go

462

Hotel. All right where's the hotel? Where am I going now? Is this the hotel? Discover Miami.

465
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,560

01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:28,329
Can I go in here? Show document. Oh hey. Excuse me.

467
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:33,500
Nice outfit. Really brings out your eyes. Ms. Knox informed me you'd be here.

468
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:38,220
She asked to make sure you brought the documents. I got them. So did you bring the documents?

469
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:42,619
I just showed you. I have the papers right here. Excellent. I would be in character the whole time.

470
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:51,020
I have the papers right here. Yes Ms. Knox. There's a guy here wearing a mask.

471
01:23:51,180 --> 01:24:03,100
Hey stand on one leg. Hey flamingo guy. Yep. Proceed somewhere. She'll be here as soon as she can.

472
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:11,020
She'll be here as soon as she can. Okay. So it's a great outfit. Thanks. Thinking it

473
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:16,630
must get pretty warm in there though. It's insulated. Huh imagine that. I guess it would

474
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:21,510
have to be if you're supposed to wear it for hours and hours every day. Do you you know

475
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:26,569
I get to use it at home for parties and things like that. Oh god.

476
01:24:30,489 --> 01:24:34,010
I have a friend who's into that sort of thing. Do you? Cosplay?

477
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:38,250
Assuming imaginary identities. It's you. He says it's very liberating.

478
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:42,649
Takes him out of the stress of everyday life and work you know. Look really.

479
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:45,850
Look do you do you want to smell inside of the head or not? Like is that what you're

01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:11,350
All right. Um let me save it. So she is on the way. There she is. Oh god. Oh god.

Act natural. I have a screwdriver. That's all I have. So Mr. I never did catch your name.

484
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,479
Flavor bird. Flavor bird the pink boy.

485
01:25:51,989 --> 01:25:55,829
So she has to be eliminated but I have a screwdriver. She has two bodyguards.

486
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:13,899
Meaning because my father doesn't need to know about this. It's just another undesired distraction.

487
01:26:13,899 --> 01:26:17,979
I don't care if the information is true or false. I don't care if it mentions moving money from

488
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:23,340
three bodyguards into tongue and valley damage control as you claimed in your correspondence.

489
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:32,899
I do care about protecting my father which let's be clear you and I are having this

490
01:26:32,899 --> 01:26:36,579
meeting because my father doesn't need to know about this. It's just another undesired

491
01:26:36,579 --> 01:26:41,060
distraction. I don't care if the information is true or false. I don't care if it mentions

492
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,539
moving money from the nexus project into tongue and valley damage control as you claim in

493
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:51,720
correspondence. I do care about protecting my father which is why how do you think flavor birds

648
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:40,489
uh completing a mission is just the beginning they are meant to be played more than once

649
02:04:40,489 --> 02:04:43,850
there are multiple plots to uncover characters to get to know and unlocks to earn

650
02:04:44,489 --> 02:04:49,210
to get the overall story of the finish line we recommend that you complete the following

651
02:04:49,210 --> 02:05:02,569
mission stories so i did this one play mission story or skip that's cool that's awesome well

i'll come back to this it's just a brother was just bird two yeah i'll skip it for now

653
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:32,649
i definitely go back and play montreal we're bleeding operatives panic is spreading and now

654
02:05:32,729 --> 02:05:43,289
we are axing our own nox was a traitor caused invulnerable damage and he won't be the last

655
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:47,930
this is exactly what the enemy wants to yell to each other they can't hear you from across that

656
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:58,890
way not the symptom and i have just the tool for the job eric soders warned you about it

659
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:22,420
we need them and once we don't cross that bridge when we get there fact remains we are

660
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:28,500
shadow boxing we need to know who we are up against that's like every was getting to that

661
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:35,060
that's every like young anime villain in every anime you've ever watched is lucas gray the late

662
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:41,619
mr. cobbs head of security cob was ground zero first of our operatives to die

663
02:06:42,659 --> 02:06:49,539
it had to be one of the staff someone with military training and access to the plane i think

664
02:06:49,539 --> 02:06:59,140
it was 47 grasping at straws gray is a mercenary a veteran of every backwater tragedy you've

665
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:07,699
ever ignored on the five o'clock news chechnya sierra leone the list goes on but before 89

666
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:17,539
nothing no records of any kind event three cia kg scenes funniest spies went dark after the

667
02:07:17,539 --> 02:07:24,359
curtain was lifted there uh i cast a very wide net lucas gray what's the in-between between

668
02:07:24,359 --> 02:07:31,380
cinematic and still image what's it called it's called something specific

669
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:36,739
quite done wetting yourselves with excitement i couldn't give two shits where he came from

670
02:07:36,739 --> 02:07:42,739
animatic i only want to know animatic yeah that's that's what how does he know about us

671
02:07:43,539 --> 02:07:54,439
oh this is from the first game this hearts and flowers crap will get us both killed

672
02:07:55,689 --> 02:08:01,289
can't you see your so-called friend is working for them now he's not the man you knew

673
02:08:01,369 --> 02:08:10,949
this is his fight too even if he doesn't realize it like it or not 47 is our last and only lead on

674
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:17,510
the partners so he wasn't even a bad guy was he a good guy all the time he's coming for us

675
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:42,199
and unlike you he won't hesitate just get me inside rico i need a favor all right cool man

676
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:50,520
i have to pee again honest to god i don't know what's with the piss bullshit that i have i'm just

677
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:57,800
pissing i wish i had a urinal right underneath me i would just mute the mic make sure the

678
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:03,659
camera's not on and just piss straight into the ground i bring it back one more i one

679
02:09:03,659 --> 02:11:09,699
more i'm drinking coffee too that's why beer back okay so let's keep going uh io interactive

680
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:12,579
is not completely on their own with wonder brothers that was that was surprising actually

681
02:11:12,659 --> 02:11:17,539
when the i saw the splash screen when i first turned it on wonder brothers i was like okay

682
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:28,840
so it was finally the wonder brothers game division was doing pretty well recently although

683
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:39,289
i mean i can't really say that for some of their movies is it still an episodic game or

684
02:11:39,289 --> 02:11:48,649
did they release it all at once it is released all at once i believe or am i wrong no it's

685
02:11:48,649 --> 02:11:59,689
here wait is it is it is it is it a swedish i thought they didn't do that this time no

686
02:11:59,689 --> 02:12:08,149
because i can't well how would i be able to play this next mission all at once same format

687
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:13,829
of season one contact has shared the identity of the shadow client a former mercenary and

688
02:12:13,829 --> 02:12:19,430
bodyguard that's good i'm glad they did it like this gray his past is a black void but

689
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:24,949
our analysts are digging deep meanwhile we've had a breakthrough of our own comparing the

690
02:12:24,949 --> 02:12:30,149
malicious attack patterns with global shipping and transportation routes we figured out how mr

691
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:34,149
gray and his paramilitaries move around the world how's the frame rates in by the way

692
02:12:34,149 --> 02:12:39,590
they're using the distribution network gotten more stable columbia's big you might be pushing

693
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:45,029
it here clearly gray must have struck a deal with it all good good consequently if we can

694
02:12:45,029 --> 02:12:50,869
cripple the cartel we can severely limit the malicious strike range but to do so we need to

695
02:12:50,869 --> 02:12:58,630
slay a three-headed serpent sociopathic cartel head rico delgado and his two closest lieutenants

696
02:12:58,630 --> 02:13:06,310
pr guru andrea martinez and servant chemist for rey franco with equal parts guts and guile

697
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:12,229
rico delgado runs a thriving billion dollar criminal empire the word is the brutal and

698
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:18,149
volatile cartel head is hell bent on becoming the number one drug lord in the world drugs

699
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:23,829
to achieve this drug lord a childhood friend of delgado's has been buttering up state leaders

700

i'm not as strong as you they have to pay for what they did it needs to stop you need to stop

1090
03:48:15,479 --> 03:48:21,979
if my source checks out we can prove the board knew about the chemical leaks there are six

1091
03:48:21,979 --> 03:48:29,530
new locations grounds for a retrial it won't make a difference they're too powerful they're

1097
03:50:42,100 --> 03:50:51,770
the mission unfortunately good evening 47 the militia has released a hostage tape outing the

1098
03:50:51,770 --> 03:50:57,690
existence of providence to the world this was a fatal mistake and our analysts are tracing its

1099
03:50:57,690 --> 03:51:04,090
origin as we speak in the meantime we have a lead on lucas gray's top lieutenant turns out the

1100
03:51:04,090 --> 03:51:09,049
delgado cartel's counterfeiting unit was creating fake ids for the militia and one

1101
03:51:09,049 --> 03:51:15,209
operative in particular stands out wazir kale an infamous south china sea pirate better known

1102
03:51:16,010 --> 03:51:21,770
there the maelstrom the maelstrom and his cutthroat band of outlaws were the scourge of

1103
03:51:21,770 --> 03:51:26,489
the shipping industry in the post-recession years but his reign of terror came to an end

1104
03:51:26,489 --> 03:51:32,809
with the disastrous 2014 hijacking of the supertanker francis king chinese elite

1105
03:51:32,809 --> 03:51:37,850
forces stormed the ship resulting in the deaths of a dozen sailors and most of the maelstrom's

1106
03:51:38,649 --> 03:51:44,889
that kale slipped away unseen the maelstrom's connection to gray is unknown but we believe it

1107
03:51:44,889 --> 03:51:50,170
was he who carried out the audacious killing of a providence ceo in shanghai along with two

1108
03:51:50,170 --> 03:51:55,610
reactivated members of his old pirate gang barnier shaw a shady figure in mumbai's

1109
03:51:55,610 --> 03:52:01,610
criminal underworld and darwood rangin the gang's old cashier turned dodgy movie producer

1110
03:52:01,610 --> 03:52:07,930
shaw rangin and the maelstrom form lucas gray's eastern eastern we are a crack strike team

1111
03:52:07,930 --> 03:52:13,690
and stopping them as our clients most pressing concern unfortunately the elusive maelstrom

1112
03:52:13,690 --> 03:52:17,930
appears to have vanished into the seedy underbelly of mumbai the cradle of his

1113
03:52:17,930 --> 03:52:22,649
criminal legend and no one knows his whereabouts or what it currently looks like i don't know

1114
03:52:22,649 --> 03:52:29,850
what he looks like a bandit queen a showbiz charlatan and one certifiable ghost i shall

1115
03:52:29,850 --> 03:52:38,739
leave you to prepare i don't even know what he looks like how am i supposed to find him

1116
03:52:41,180 --> 03:52:47,540
all right so we got to find the maelstrom and verify his identity then we've got to

1117
03:52:49,530 --> 03:53:03,379
get rid of vania and darwood darwood any method anyway it's possible let's go to the

1118
03:53:03,459 --> 03:53:08,979
planning stage all right smuggling in an item i don't i can't do anything don't have any

1124
03:54:20,020 --> 03:54:25,799
home to more than 12 million people if you wanted to disappear and hide from the world

1125
03:54:25,799 --> 03:54:32,709
this vast city is perfect the maze-like swarming slums offer secret paths and

1126
03:54:32,709 --> 03:54:38,549
surprises around every path and corners the elusive maelstrom knows the city like the back

1127
03:54:38,549 --> 03:54:45,989
of his own hand locating him will be a considerable challenge a place to start could be the slums

1128
03:54:45,989 --> 03:54:51,829
where his former gang the crows has recently risen from the ashes okay darwood rangin will

1129
03:54:51,829 --> 03:54:56,709
be easy to find in his half-finished tower wrapping up his new film called mumbai hero

1130

1369
04:52:51,000 --> 04:53:02,900

1370
04:53:02,900 --> 04:53:10,900
go up from here somehow there we go got it 47 this is one of the mumbai tools my records

1371
04:53:10,900 --> 04:53:15,700
show a few residential complaints about a new tenant in the building okay something related

1372
04:53:15,700 --> 04:53:28,020
to strange behavior might be worth looking into let's go pay him a visit strange tenant

1373
04:53:29,139 --> 04:53:41,799
i'm currently trespassing so you know how do you trespass in an apartment building

1374
04:53:41,799 --> 04:53:47,959
how could they not well well it appears we have a rival assassin in mumbai and he's training

1375
04:53:47,959 --> 04:53:53,720
his sights on darwood rangin by the looks of it i'd say we're dealing with a local operator

1376
04:53:53,720 --> 04:54:05,750
known as the cashmereian i'll never make the shot a local hitman known as the cashmereian

1377
04:54:05,750 --> 04:54:10,950
is in mumbai on business he set up a sniper nest in a tower above a stairwell in the local

1378
04:54:10,950 --> 04:54:24,540
tool it appears he's targeting okay good thinking 47 now if we could only make rangin

1379
04:54:24,540 --> 04:54:36,250
appear in that window somehow that scope adjusted with this quarter of viewfinder

1380
04:54:37,209 --> 04:55:07,529
why don't i why don't i just get a better view myself right i guess i'll just go over there

1381
04:55:08,330 --> 04:55:13,590
and then aim up into the window oh the scope isn't adjusted that's right

1382
04:55:14,389 --> 04:55:23,290
maybe i should take his clothes he's got a dongle laptop dongle apartment key

1383
04:55:24,409 --> 04:55:39,209
and he lives here not trespassing anymore all right so let me say this again so i need to

1384
04:55:39,290 --> 04:55:46,810
find a way to get his attention to get him to the window how do i get his attention

1385
04:55:57,560 --> 04:56:14,020
a coin a coin doesn't reach that far throw a soda can across the city i think they hit

1386
04:56:14,020 --> 04:56:26,779
somebody right in the head shoot the window to make him check the window why am i shooting

1387
04:56:26,779 --> 04:56:33,860
at him anyways what why don't i just take this who cares about that guy where's the guy i need

1388
04:56:33,860 --> 04:56:44,869
to kill he's like up there where's the other person i need to kill is it just two well there's

1389
04:56:44,869 --> 04:57:15,369
no okay i gotta he's inside the building just get his attention i mean i could shoot i could

1390
04:57:15,369 --> 04:57:23,720
shoot the window but that kind of defeats the purpose of being down here i have to

1391
04:57:23,720 --> 04:57:45,639
go all the way down i'm gonna try and shoot the window just to see what happens i can't

1392
04:57:45,639 --> 04:57:50,200
shoot it won't shoot until he's there so let's shoot with this and put it back

1393
04:57:51,080 --> 04:58:10,250
did you hear it shoot through his open window

1394
04:58:37,509 --> 04:59:34,939
and again he's here he comes shoot him what it didn't fire uh this is obviously not correct

1395
04:59:34,939 --> 04:59:39,099
backflip pogchamp all right well i'm gonna restart it and i'm gonna go into the apartment

1396
04:59:39,099 --> 05:00:03,770
building what is it shaking so violently if only you had a tripod this would go so much

1397
05:00:03,770 --> 05:00:21,799
more smoothly all right you all right so i'm gonna go to the apartment i have an apartment

1398
05:00:21,799 --> 05:00:31,580

1399
05:00:31,580 --> 05:00:36,540
can scream at him what maybe this probably maybe there's a megaphone in this apartment

1400
05:00:36,540 --> 05:00:52,630
somewhere those are some nice trees adjust the scope i did i adjusted the scope and he was like

1421
05:07:01,319 --> 05:07:16,259

1422
05:07:16,259 --> 05:07:30,970
shit out of people watch i want this though okay what if i i don't want this guy's disguise

1423
05:07:30,970 --> 05:08:01,750
anymore i'm gonna put on the bodyguard costume wait what got it right okay

1424
05:08:01,830 --> 05:08:09,290
he's a traveling salesman or something 47 this is one of the mumbai chores my records show a

1425
05:08:09,290 --> 05:08:13,610
few residential complaints i was sitting there trying to figure out the whole time how to like

1426
05:08:13,610 --> 05:08:21,450
distract the guy might be worth looking into it turns out i killed the whole story mission

1427
05:08:21,450 --> 05:08:25,930
because i shot the guy with his own rifle that's how i'm understanding this right that's

1428
05:08:25,930 --> 05:08:55,750
correct did i miss the stairs okay here we go well well it appears we have a rival assassin

1429
05:08:55,750 --> 05:09:01,189
in mumbai and he's training his sights on darwood rangin by the looks of it i'd say

1430
05:09:01,189 --> 05:09:05,430
we're dealing with a local operator known as the cashmere i was wondering why the other

1431
05:09:05,430 --> 05:09:09,750
the hints stopped a local hitman known as the cashmereian

1432
05:09:10,709 --> 05:09:16,099
damn broken viewfinder if i can't adjust this good thinking 47

1433
05:09:17,540 --> 05:09:24,090
now if we could only make rangin appear in that window somehow oh my god this is

1434
05:09:27,900 --> 05:09:34,540
karen dar aka the cashmereian was born in the u.s but fled to his mother's native land india

1435
05:09:34,540 --> 05:09:39,819
20 years ago following an fbi investigation into a string of syrian killings in texas

1436
05:09:40,619 --> 05:09:44,779
he adopted a new identity here talk to the assassin as a gun for hire for local

1437
05:09:44,779 --> 05:09:52,299
mobsters no i'm not going to talk to who would want rangin dead how does a professional assassin

1438
05:09:52,299 --> 05:10:02,459
not know how to focus a scope i have no idea that's like the equivalent of knowing how to

1439
05:10:02,459 --> 05:10:12,060
draw with crayons as a child a toddler all right so now we have to make him go in the window

1440
05:10:14,389 --> 05:10:24,139
and then we have to find the maelstrom so how do i i'm going to distract him

1441
05:10:26,580 --> 05:10:39,959
infiltrate the apartment infiltrate the lounge save it okay so we're going to get up there

1442
05:10:41,369 --> 05:10:44,970
uh i could take a one of the worker outfits but not really necessary

1443
05:10:45,689 --> 05:10:54,340

about you know we've been fucking around a little bit we've been doing some story missions

1702
06:09:07,430 --> 06:09:12,389
we figure six hours six hours six hours seven hours something like that at the halfway point

1703
06:09:12,389 --> 06:09:23,560
here so i will see you guys tomorrow probably around the same time around five to six p.m

1704
06:09:23,560 --> 06:09:30,819
eastern two three p.m maybe pacific the green screen is not tomorrow why not tomorrow

1705
06:09:31,459 --> 06:09:35,380
because i'd rather put it on friday where more people could probably watch

1706
06:09:36,180 --> 06:09:45,740
and with that thanks for sticking around i had a lot of fun this is this game as hilarious

1707
06:09:45,740 --> 06:09:52,709
and amazing as i expected it to be so it's just more of the if you liked hitman from a couple

1708
06:09:52,709 --> 06:09:58,860
years ago this just they just did more it's just more stuff it's just more missions and

1709
06:09:59,580 --> 06:10:10,869
more scenarios which is kind of what everybody wanted in the first place so it's good anyways

1710
06:10:10,869 --> 06:10:16,900
uh i'll see you guys soon see you tomorrow and i'm gonna hit the escape button then i'm

1711
06:10:16,900 --> 06:10:24,470
gonna exit the menu and then i'm gonna put up this thing and we'll do the bits

1712
06:10:26,150 --> 06:10:32,790
plus there's other things to do maybe maybe we'll do two more streams of this game i would

1713
06:10:32,790 --> 06:10:38,419
assume there's still lots to do so it's not like i'm gonna blow through all the story

1714
06:10:38,419 --> 06:10:42,659
missions and never do anything else so we'll do another we'll do probably three streams

1715
06:10:42,659 --> 06:10:45,860
at hitman tomorrow we'll complete the story missions we'll go through the areas

1716
06:10:45,860 --> 06:11:00,020
and after that we'll see but anyways let us go back to way earlier this evening have you taken

1717
06:11:00,020 --> 06:11:07,110
off see you soon and if you're sticking around hey thanks uh elizabeth thanks for the one dollar

1718
06:11:07,110 --> 06:11:13,529

1719
06:11:13,529 --> 06:11:21,299
uh uh zolnog thank you zolnog for the one zero zero zero the ten bucks

1720
06:11:22,979 --> 06:11:30,250
ten dollars here appreciated zol that was the first bit that came in peaceful hailey thanks

1721
06:11:30,250 --> 06:11:34,900
for the one dollar hey germa just want to say thanks uh say how much i love what you do

1722
06:11:35,459 --> 06:11:39,619
also but having trouble lately with job troubles like i don't have one right now

1723
06:11:39,619 --> 06:11:42,819
and i want to make a career out of voice acting and it's harder than i thought but

1724
06:11:42,819 --> 06:11:47,939
it's what i love and i also love what you do i really hope i can be successful i keep having

1725
06:11:47,939 --> 06:11:52,580
doubts about it just because i feel pathetic not having a shitty part-time job right now hope i

1726
06:11:52,580 --> 06:12:01,319
can do what i've always wanted to do thanks my best advice i can give you is always have

1727
06:12:02,490 --> 06:12:07,500
always have two or three things you're interested in that you like that you care

1728
06:12:07,500 --> 06:12:13,180
about so you have things that you're always cool doing you know what i mean have like

1729
06:12:13,259 --> 06:12:17,900
at least two or three passions things that you really love so then if one works out and the

1730
06:12:17,900 --> 06:12:24,919
other two don't then you're still doing something that you really like to do right uh voice acting

1731
06:12:24,919 --> 06:12:31,619
is it's a tough gig it's a hard business to get into it's um i've been kind of out of it

1732
06:12:31,619 --> 06:12:38,759
for a long time but the best resource is available for you you just have to kind of

1733
06:12:38,840 --> 06:12:46,040
work on a demo get out there be try to uh put yourself into online cartoons try to audition for

1734
06:12:46,040 --> 06:12:53,459
online cartoons they still do them that's what i did and make sure you have three things that

1735
06:12:53,459 --> 06:12:58,279
you like to do because you'll never be disappointed like i think a lot of times people just

1736
06:12:59,080 --> 06:13:04,599
have the one thing that they want to do one thing and they go for it go for it go for

1737
06:13:04,599 --> 06:13:08,279
it go for it and if it doesn't work out it's like oh well fuck man it didn't work out but

1738
06:13:08,279 --> 06:13:13,020
if you still have other things that you know that you like you won't feel that way

1739
06:13:15,029 --> 06:13:21,509
i knew i i here's the three things that i've always always wanted to do one uh i love

1740
06:13:21,509 --> 06:13:25,750
computers i've always wanted to be somewhere in the field of computers whether it's with

1741
06:13:25,750 --> 06:13:30,630
customer support with com with uh you know computer software or and this is by the way

1742
06:13:30,630 --> 06:13:35,110
this is before um even like i started college so i would have obviously done more

1743
06:13:35,110 --> 06:13:42,709
into this if i did uh love computers love animals i volunteered at an animal shelter free like

1744
06:13:42,709 --> 06:13:47,189
just over a year just maybe it was like 11 months 12 months or something i really wanted

1745
06:13:47,189 --> 06:13:52,310
to work with animals because i fucking love animals i love dogs uh like a veterinary vet

1746
06:13:52,310 --> 06:13:55,590
tech or something like that is something that i always like i would be completely fine with

1747
06:13:55,590 --> 06:14:01,830
doing you know what i mean uh then there was like voice acting and videos and big comedies

1748
06:14:01,830 --> 06:14:05,909
shit you know what i mean like that was another thing try to spread out your passions

1749
06:14:06,709 --> 06:14:16,919
that way you're never disappointed your computer breaks every other stream you made the right

1750
06:14:16,919 --> 06:14:22,520
choice not going into it well but that's what i mean like but that's something i wanted to do

1751
06:14:23,400 --> 06:14:32,619
if just because like my computer breaks doesn't mean i what is that even components break my

1752
06:14:32,619 --> 06:14:39,459
ram died a stick of ram died that's not because i like peed on it but that's really

1753
06:14:39,459 --> 06:14:45,020
the best advice i can give i wish you the best of luck hopefully you end up doing something

1754
06:14:45,020 --> 06:14:53,720
that you like to do good luck to you uh div usp thanks for the three bucks no message thank you

1762
06:15:36,520 --> 06:15:40,860

1763
06:15:40,860 --> 06:15:44,939
my pc is a piece of shit but i played some of the miami before the frame drops became too

1764
06:15:44,939 --> 06:15:51,880
much hitman 2016 was my game of the year enjoy the sequel this is gonna be rough for the end of

1765
06:15:51,880 --> 06:15:58,569
this year because there's a minute least there's been a lot of at least top five at least top

1766
06:15:58,569 --> 06:16:09,000
six maybe games hitman it was i feel like ah it's hitman again but it very well could be

1767
06:16:13,299 --> 06:16:18,459
it just it's everything that i want in a video game the only thing it does not have

1768
06:16:19,259 --> 06:16:25,740
is cars if you could drive around and hitman actually just commandeer vehicles and drive

1769
06:16:25,740 --> 06:16:31,900
around and it was like an actual like open open world game with vehicles i don't think you would

1770
06:16:31,900 --> 06:16:36,619
ever make another video game that i would ever play ever again that's the only game i would

1771
06:16:36,619 --> 06:16:47,369
play i would only play that game it would go up a letter grade to to an s spider-man is was

1772
06:16:48,009 --> 06:16:57,049

06:27:27,240 --> 06:27:34,090
halfway point probably to the end and see where we are after that because then the day after

1842
06:27:34,090 --> 06:27:40,700
that is green screen unless anything major happens which i don't think it will if there's

1843
06:27:40,700 --> 06:27:45,340
some kind of technical problem where i have to push it to saturday i don't think i will though

1844
06:27:45,340 --> 06:27:55,740
i think it's pretty locked in that it's gonna happen friday have you been following the

1845
06:27:55,740 --> 06:28:06,630
hitman 2 story yes i guess a little a little make it a star wars scroll what do i think of

1846
06:28:06,630 --> 06:28:20,340
hitman 2 so far i think it's great i think it is summarize it uh so last game the bad guy

1847
06:28:21,779 --> 06:28:31,939
was actually your uh like a shared of bunk beds with you and you're both subjects of

1848
06:28:31,939 --> 06:28:40,299
assassin of an assassin program and diana um diana's uh that way i don't know what spoiler

1849
06:28:40,299 --> 06:28:48,520
but diana had an issue something happened to diana when she was younger that's it that's all

1850
06:28:48,520 --> 06:29:00,520
i know well yeah pretty much you got two opposing forces you know you got a red and a blue

1851
06:29:01,240 --> 06:29:04,520
and you know that there's a thing this entity that this it's a big circle

1852
06:29:08,229 --> 06:29:13,270
spoiler now i know something happens with diana's in every single one of these games

1853
06:29:14,229 --> 06:29:30,740
they're in every she's in every game spark notes for hitman 2 but for real thank you all you guys

1854
06:29:30,740 --> 06:29:46,549
here all the resubs all the new subs spoilers we know she's in the game uh except for most of

1855
06:29:46,549 --> 06:29:51,659
absolution we don't talk about absolution absolution really is such a weird game

1856
06:29:52,459 --> 06:30:01,380
because it sits right in the middle of absolute perfection of video games you know what i mean

1857
06:30:02,020 --> 06:30:08,099
you've got like the first few hitmans were just you know genre defining pieces of video game

1858
06:30:08,099 --> 06:30:17,139
media right and then you have absolution which was just what the hell is this it was like

1859
06:30:17,139 --> 06:30:20,900
good but it was like an action game it was it was kind of linear and then you got like

1860
06:30:20,900 --> 06:30:29,700
these two which are fucking fantastic absolution is a vine game but it's just

1861
06:30:29,700 --> 06:30:35,060
like it just doesn't it just sits right in the middle in a weird place in hitman

1862
06:30:35,860 --> 06:30:52,419
lore and hitman gameplay because the thing that predate it and i think that succeeds it

1863
06:30:53,139 --> 06:30:59,340
is just so much better it's just odd but i will see you tomorrow we will talk more about hitman

1864
06:30:59,340 --> 06:31:07,369
because we're gonna play it again tomorrow is absolution a good starting game no i think you

1865
06:31:07,369 --> 06:31:11,130
should only play absolution if you really really love hitman and it's one of your

1866
06:31:11,130 --> 06:31:18,169
favorite franchises if you want to start somewhere it's just i mean it's just hard

1867
06:31:18,169 --> 06:31:31,130
at the just start at the first hitman from 2016 you'll get it or hitman 2 i would just

1868
06:31:31,130 --> 06:31:39,139
start with the one that came out in 2016 blood money is the best one so far or the best one

1869
06:31:39,139 --> 06:31:45,540
in that originals yeah it is but i would just start with just get a good taste of it start

1870
06:31:45,540 --> 06:32:00,810
with the best you can play blood money on browser that's kind of weird but with that

1871
06:32:01,529 --> 06:32:08,970
see you all tomorrow have a great rest of your night take care sleep well goodbye
