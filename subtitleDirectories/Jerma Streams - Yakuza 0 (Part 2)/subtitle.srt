00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:09,349
Okay, hi. So, I just wrote www.tv.tv. Oops. Hold on. Let me fix this.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,179
www.tv.com. Whoever owns that domain, congratulations for the 500 trillion dollars

3
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:25,859
it took for somebody to buy that domain from you. What a shitty domain, too. Who cares?

4
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:39,880
Nobody's going to tv.com for any reason. The value of that domain was probably 50 million dollars.

5
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:50,619
In 2000. Not anymore. They sat on that for way too long if you didn't get rid of it.

6
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,679
Are you high? No. All right, let me just, let me tweet this. Hold on.

7
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,469
All right. Yakuza minigames. Pogchamp. All right, let's go.

8
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:14,569
How you doing? How's everybody doing today? Are we doing good? What are we looking at here?

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:24,040
All right, there's an image already. Get well. Oh, look at this. Really? Oh. Get well. Wish you

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,700
best soon. I'm going to put this on stream. This is cute. Well, thanks, guys. This is cute stuff.

11
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:49,739
I love the cute stuff. You see, this is a little get well card. Look at this. I don't deserve this.

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,769
Oh, this is cool. I thought that was a dick over there in the left. I'm not going to lie. I thought

13
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:14,009
that was just like a sagging dick with like one big ball, but it's a happy face. Don't be sexual.

14
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:25,379
Stop being sexual. I'm sorry, but I mean, you know what I'm saying? It's a little bit more

15
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:34,259
mature recently over the last few months, if you know what I'm saying. What does that say?

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:49,909
What does this say? Pog? Ipo happy. Oh, they're all... It's awesome. Thank you.

17
00:02:52,789 --> 00:03:01,610
We're going to play more Yakuza and sorry if I sound sick. The thing happened where I got better.

18
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,810
I felt really fine last night and into this morning and I took a shower and then it got worse

19
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,930
and then it got better and then it got worse again. So don't mind me if I mute the microphone

20
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:22,009
sometimes and just like... It's probably going to happen. By the way, I just want to make sure

21
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,169
everybody knows this. If you weren't here the other day, I'm negative for COVID. I took a test

22
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,409
because, you know, if you're coughing, stuffy nose, headache, flu-like symptoms, it's like,

23
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:36,490
okay, I probably should get on top of this. No COVID. So that's pretty good, right? I'm happy

24
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:47,669
about that. So we'll just see how it goes. Odd bless. Yeah, I know, right? Yeah, we're going to

25
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,389
pick up right where we left off in Yakuza. I was in the middle of getting a potential bowling

26
00:03:52,389 --> 00:04:04,120
girlfriend. So that's exciting. Very exciting stuff. I don't care about the story. I don't

27
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,039
care about the combat. I care about the bowling girlfriend. That's it. That's why I'm playing this

28
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,870
game a second time. Remember, do you like Yakuza? Yeah, it's pretty good. Why are you playing it

29
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:23,589
again? Well, you know... I require only one thing, okay? From in like a female interest.

30
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,139
And you want to come over and just like play Diablo 2 for like four hours or so and then

31
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,220
just like hang out, you know, whatever. That's all I require. That's the only thing I need.

32
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:43,050
That's it. Yeah, I heard about Vinny. That sucks. He'll be back though. He'll be back stronger than

33
00:04:43,050 --> 00:05:05,850
ever. He'll be fine. He got a suspension. Yeah. He's showing potential nudity on stream. He'll be

34
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:16,550
back. I look forward to the next stream, Vinny. How could you not look forward to a Vinny stream?

35
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:26,389
They're all good. All right, let's go. He's not here. Well, he doesn't have to be here.

36
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:35,269
I like looked at like the viewer list. Is Vinny here? Oh, Vinny's awesome. He'll be back.

37
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:47,800
And I, how can I, why can this not work? No camera, right? No camera? Because I'm

38
00:05:47,800 --> 00:06:00,040
naked. I'm not actually naked. I just don't have a top on because like fuck tops, right?

39
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:11,819
I wear bottoms. I don't wear tops. What the hell am I doing? Uh, what? Hello? Video game?

40
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:25,209
Video game? Um, I'd like to. All right, let's get back into Yakuza. I want to do mini games. I don't

41
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:31,220
really care about playing the game. Oh, if you missed it, we got a couple of dragons last time.

42
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:44,889
A couple of lizards. Uh, where's the health one? Oh, here we go. So I can send these to my item box,

43
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:59,019
right? How do I do that? Opponents? What the hell is all this? This is not bowling. Valuables.

44
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,939
Go to club sunshine. Hold on. I will. What was the next thing I had to do?

45
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:10,889
Wasn't it just have fun a bunch of times? Enjoy erotic videos. All right. Is this actually erotic

46
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:20,839
videos? What am I going to get banned? It's like, Oh, Vinnie got banned earlier for like nudity.

47
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:28,379
Like here. Am I going to, should I get banned too? Do I do it? What is going on with my controller?

48
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:39,879
Stop. What happened? Why does this thing suck? Oh, hold on. Can I ask you a few questions? All

49
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:52,170
right. We got stop, stop by a police officer. Stop and search, huh? This is the music. What's

50
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,970
your name and what do you do for a living? The name's Kiru. I'm in a hurry here and I'm also in

51
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,050
a hurry to read the fact that we've got five community subs from head full of crap. Thank you.

52
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,370
Head full of crap. Appreciate that. Excellent. Well, we've had some trouble around these parts.

53
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,550
Just to be sure. Would you mind if I checked your belongings? My thing's going to do with any trouble

54
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,920
around here. Relax. It's just a precaution. Can you show me what you're carrying?

55
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,100
All right. Is it more embarrassing to have a bunch of like lizard toys or Coke?

56
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,529
From the, you know what I mean? Like, why do you have like four lizard toys?

57
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:49,019
Okay. You win. What should I hand over? I mean, should I give them the lizard toy? All right. Here.

58
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,620
How about this? This is what I have. Hmm. This is about as safe as it gets. It doesn't look like

59
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,159
you're carrying anything dangerous here. Take this back. I got nothing to hide. Did he expect

60
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,820
me to hand him a gun or something? He didn't search me. He just said, hey, could you present

61
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,419
me with something? What? I could have had, what am I going to hand him the drugs in my pocket?

62
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,049
Thank you for your cooperation. Give me a break. Cops like you are always abusing your power.

63
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,009
You never stop to think about how much of an inconvenience this is for regular citizens.

64
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:29,740
Well, that may be so for other police officers. Not for me though. I'm only doing this because

65
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:36,470
it's all good. It's all I'm good for. Huh? What do you mean? Oh, never mind about me.

66
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,049
I'm the one asking the questions here. Huh? It doesn't make sense. I was sure you had something

67
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:49,419
big on you. I've got a nose for these things. Well, I guess your nose failed you this time.

68
00:09:50,519 --> 00:10:10,580
By the way, is your nose broken? No. What the fuck? My sixth sense tells me I'll find something huge

69
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,610
if I dig deep enough. I don't know what to say. Why does that keep happening? I'm a pro at

70
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,850
stopping searches until I'm sure you're not a threat. I'm going to keep questioning you, okay?

71
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,570
Not okay. Oh, come on, Kiryu-san. Be a good sport. It won't take long. I just want to be sure.

72
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,909
I give up. Fine. Have it your way. Just keep it short. I mean, we'll keep it really short.

73
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:41,620
I'm trying to get into the porn theater. Come on. All right. Thank you. My name is Officer

74
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,620
Kikuchi. I'll see you around. Oh, I'm a friendship with Officer Kikuchi.

75
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,029
You got to know Officer Stop and Search Kikuchi. Interacting with him will gradually fill the

76
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,750
friendship gauge. You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu.

77
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:04,419
Build your friendship with Officer Kikuchi and see what happens. No, I don't think I will.

78
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:17,299
All right, porn theater. Do you bowl? If you bowl, then you and I are going to be good friends.

79
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:31,110
No, I'm not. Is this bad? You're going to watch Attack on Titan? Oh, shit. That's right. It comes

80
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:45,399
back. That's right. Isn't it like, yeah, maybe. Is it okay? At Gandhara, you can watch videos of

81
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,639
varied cast of gorgeous girls. As you meet these women out in the city under certain conditions,

82
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,039
new video content will be available. Search every corner of town to find your dream girl.

83
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:05,269
Hey, S. Ducks, thanks for the ten committed subs. That's a lot of money. Thank you. We charge

84
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:19,419
eight hundred dollars for one view. You're gonna actually stop Omega Lo. All right, I'm gone.

85
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:29,700
You're gonna get banned. Okay, I'm not gonna get banned. No, I'm not gonna get banned. I'm not

86
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,580
gonna see anything. All right, let's go. What's next on the list of things to do? It's soft core

87
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:41,320
porn. Okay. Well, you said the word porn. No, no, no, dude, don't worry. It's okay. It's soft core

88
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:52,779
porn. It's you said porn. Oh, shit. It's got histamine. Wait, because I bumped into him.

89
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:23,429
Nice. You can skip it if you have to. Yeah, let me skip it. Violence good, boobies bad. Hey,

90
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:30,629
I don't make the rules. All right, I just have to live by them. Yes, I know. I understand. I can

91
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:36,470
gouge a guy's eyes out with a knife in a horror game and pulls eyes out and eat him and squishes

92
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,990
blood will shoot out of the sides of my mouth and then I can like throw that guy off a cliff

93
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,830
and watch his body fucking roll and smash into rocks and his head smashes on the rock and the

94
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:53,190
back of his head explodes and then I climb down there like Gollum and I eat his brains and then

95
00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,019
shit on him. But if like a nipple shows up on I got in trouble. I know I get it. I understand.

96
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:22,779
Look, I don't make the rules. Oh, wait, it's this guy again. I just walked around the circle.

97
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:35,909
What should I hand over? Oh, how about um, no, I don't want to give him my rare toys.

98
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:47,259
I don't have a gun. Oh, here. Oh, this looks really dangerous. What do you use this for?

99
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,850
It's not dangerous at all. Everyone carries around that sort of thing.

100
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,139
No, they don't. I'm beginning to suspect you might be a threat to public safety.

101
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:03,129
Kira-san, tell me what it's for. It's complicated. It is a very specific use.

102
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:09,669
And what would that be? You know, it's a little embarrassing so I didn't want to have to say it.

103
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:21,460
It's actually for. Yes. What happened? What are they doing? I've never heard about that before.

104
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,480
I guess I've led a sheltered life. What is that implying? I've used a gun?

105
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,470
I still get the feeling you're not being completely honest.

106
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,860
But you can go. Are we not friends? Oh, no, we're not friends.

107
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,059
All right, what am I supposed to be doing? I gotta go to the store.

108
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,840
I gotta buy some stuff. All right, let's go to the drugstore. Oh, shit.

109
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:22,950
I'm gonna go beast mode on this one. What's the graph for beast mode again? Holy shit.

110
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:30,230
That was awesome. You're not under any circumstances play Mahjong.

111
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,470
I'm going to. Unlike a lot of probably streamers that you've seen play this game,

112
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:43,539
I know how to play Mahjong. I used to play it back in like 1996 on my old Windows 95 PC.

113
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,250
I know how to play Mahjong. Oh, why would I not play it?

114
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,070
Oh, this gives me a health boost. I'll take it.

115
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:20,069
The different Mahjong. I mean different. It's not the same Mahjong. What? It's different,

116
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:27,450
like solitaire different to what? Why would they do that? I only know how to play Mahjong classic.

117
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,240
What's that? What am I actually? How am I supposed to? How do I progress the game?

118
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:45,180
Can I pick him up off the ground? I can. What the fuck? I can pick him up by the legs.

119
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:57,910
And I can do like a bam bam. Oh, shit. Hold on. All right. If you see a guy walking at you with

120
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,190
a bike, I think you turn around and run. Because regardless of this person is strong,

121
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,430
it doesn't matter how tough this guy is. They're holding a bike in their hands in the air.

122
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:28,259
Oh, shit. Go back to the videos. You're a coward. Coward? Coward? You're saying I'm a coward?

123
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,829
What's what's what are we doing? What's what's this? What's going on here? Wait.

124
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:41,059
I like beast mode, but brawler is probably my favorite. Okay, I got four, three million.

125
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:49,849
Okay, hold on. A mighty knee strike. Old Y. Okay, that's cool. Max health. I'll take it. Yeah,

126
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:58,569
too bad. Max health. Go back to when I where I learned beast style.

127
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:12,119
Beast is the best. Beast is the best. 5% completion. Oh, my goodness. Wait, where's

128
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:21,160
the bowling alley? I want to go bowl. I go back to where I learned beast mode. I don't know what

129
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:35,779
that was. Best automatically picks up beast, picks up heavy items in the bowling alley.

130
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:45,099
Is it near the bowling alley? This is over here. Okay, I'll go to bowling alley. Yeah,

131
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:58,630
I'm not opening any links for at least the next 30 to 40 minutes. Understand? No links for 40 to

132
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:14,180
30 to 40 minutes. Beast mode is really fun. It's a big cleave. It's too slow, though.

133
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,140
It's back against the big bar. Oh, my goodness. That was horrible.

134
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,660
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry.

135
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:57,369
That's instantly dead. There's so many instant kill moves here. All right, bowling alley. Let's

136
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:10,950
go. And I'm gonna go visit my bowling alley and my bowling alley friend. Okay, so by the bowling

137
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,029
alley. This is where we did the advice for the band. Let me just see how she's doing. You know,

138
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:41,480
let me just check in on her. Wrong way. Let me see how she's doing. Okay, I got to act natural.

139
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,759
I came here specifically because I wanted to see her, right? I only came here to see her. But

140
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,359
what do we have on the street here? We have a drugstore. We have a video store. Okay,

141
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,640
I got to go into the video store. I got to go to the drugstore. I got to make sure I have a

142
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:05,019
bag that has the drugstore's name on it, right? Like, okay, CVS. I have a CVS bag and I'm holding

143
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:12,119
it with the logo out. Just get a fucking coconut water. Who cares? I got to walk in here with the

144
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:21,000
CVS bag facing her. Hey, what the fuck? What is going on here? Oh, yeah, I'm CVS. Yeah,

145
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,150
I was getting coconut water. I was on my break and just popping in. You're a serial killer. What?

146
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:56,200
What are you talking about? No, not. Oh, CVS. What? That's Dennis. What do you mean,

147
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:07,799
Dennis? And then I tap on the ... No, excuse me. Hold on a minute. Me and her are in a very, very ...

148
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,359
We're talking and we're hanging out. She's like, come back and see me. Come back and see me,

149
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:21,880
right? But I got to make it ... Look, I went to CVS, right? Come on. She wanted me. She told me to

150
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,960
come back five times. She's like, come back and see me. Come back and see me. I'm going to come

151
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,019
back and see you, but I went to CVS first, right? I just slam dunk you in fucking bowling.

152
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:43,029
Oh, yeah. I got time for a game. Oh, you're on break from work. You just went to CVS,

153
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:47,029
but you got time for a game? I mean, yeah, I do. Of course I do.

154
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:00,839
Where do you work? Oh, I mean, in here and there. A job. A lot of jobs, you know.

155
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:20,420
I'm on break. I'm on break for four hours. She's going to tell me to come back tomorrow. She's

156
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,299
going to say, hey, come back and see me tomorrow. And we're like, oh, yeah. You know, if I'm in the

157
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,420
area, I'm going to show up with like a bag of ... With a bag of like takeout. With a bunch of

158
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,180
food in my mouth. I was just getting takeout down street. I'm in the area. You wanted a baseball?

159
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:55,019
Ooh, that was bad. She's trying. Yeah. No. Okay. Excuse me. Me and her,

160
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,859
I've made it very clear that we're like trying ... We're like, want to talk to each other.

161
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:22,920
Let her win. Should I? All right. Is it too obvious if I just do this?

162
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:55,779
No, she'll think you're weak. She laughed. Yeah. Stop saying simp. I didn't say simp. You did. Who

163
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:12,859
is doing that? Stop saying that. God, she sucks. You have to rush her. No, I'm not going to just ...

164
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:31,579
I want it to be like fun. I just want to have fun. It's a close game. Oh, yeah. Let's go.

165
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:50,660
I can't wait till she shows up at like my work with like a bag of Doritos with like

166
00:26:50,660 --> 00:27:19,480
the Doritos logo facing out. Sponsored. No. How would you be sponsored in like

167
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:40,519
just a regular day to day? What? A sponsored date? I think at that point, why do I feel like some

168
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,109
influencers do that? I just want to make sure ... Are you okay with that? This is a sponsored

169
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:52,230
date. Are you okay with me having like different logos, all these different toys and stuff around

170
00:27:52,230 --> 00:28:00,440
the dinner table? I got sponsored by Hasbro. I have to like always carry around the toys with me.

171
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,740
Do you have to do that here? Yeah. It's part of the contract. Even when there's no cameras on?

172
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:37,960
Yeah. How will they know if you don't? Manly voice. My manly voice is like this. Okay. Did I

173
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,509
start talking like this more often? I'm not going to look at chat, but what I want someone to do

174
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:54,230
is I want them to count how many times the word stop in all capitals has been spammed.

175
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm not going to keep track. I'm not going to look. I'm going to say two or 3000 times.

176
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,740
Something like that. I don't know. Whatever. I don't care. You think I care about that?

177
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:18,339
No. Why would I even look? I don't care. And time. Okay. How many times it was said?

178
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:28,869
Oh, an event is scheduled to take place at Mock Bowl. Your friendship with Emery will not increase

179
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:35,430
until then. You need to make progress with Kamarucha Real Estate Royale for the next event to start.

180
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:47,960
Unlocked as you... All right. Let's go. Okay. I got to go to the Real Estate Royale.

181
00:29:48,680 --> 00:30:05,380
How do I do this shit? It's not unlocked. It's chapter five. Are you kidding me? It's like

182
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:16,390
chapter two right now. All right. How do I progress the story? Turn around. Do the story,

183
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:27,240
you cuck. Really? You're going to call me... Really? Well, now you're in big trouble. Now

184
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,039
you've lost a little bit of privileges here. I wish I could... You know what? You know what

185
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:40,200
I wish you could do on Twitch? I don't want to ban you. I don't want to ban you. I want to like

186
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:47,220
make it so you can't write the word cuck on this stream for like an hour. So you'll be like,

187
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,339
oh, whatever you say, cuck. Wait, it didn't work. I just blacked it out. Why? No, I want to say that

188
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:57,559
word. I want to just remove words from your vocabulary like that. You know what I mean?

189
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,539
You're not banned. You can stay. You can't say that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ladies.

190
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:21,210
Ladies, I'm sorry. You can just blacklist the word yourself. Oh yeah, I can do that. No,

191
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,660
but I just want to make sure that person can't say it. And everybody else can spam it, but they can't.

192
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:36,359
All right, how do I play the game? How do I progress the story down the alley?

193
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:57,619
Oh shit, this is Yakuza. All right, let's bike somebody in the head. Come on. Come on. Come on.

194
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:17,660
All right. And you missed. Can I throw him up the stairs? No. Imagine getting thrown.

195
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,059
How do you go up the stairs instead of down the stairs? That would be worse than falling down the

196
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:30,869
stairs. Hey there, buddy. Been looking for you. You again. Got a lot of nerves showing up now.

197
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:36,579
What do you want? I think it's pretty clear what I want. Time to pay your protection money, pal.

198
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
If you're doing business in Komurocho, you're doing business with us.

199
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,140
The hell with that. It's not protection money if I don't show up to actually protect me when I need

200
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,059
it. And you have the gall to ask me for more? When you need it? What are you talking about?

201
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:59,750
I'm talking about Tachibana real estate. When they came and chased me out,

202
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:09,140
you people were nowhere in sight. Some protection. Tachibana? What? Oh, Tachibana real estate. Yeah.

203
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:16,500
They're, uh, look, it's complicated. Complicated my ass. You got scared and ran away.

204
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:24,579
What could be simpler? Scared? What? What do you think? Thanks to you, I had to relocate.

205
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,940
Now I'm scrambling to get new customers to make up for all these ones I lost

206
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:33,619
and pay you even if I wanted to. I think you better keep that attitude in check, asshole.

207
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:43,099
Mind if I cut in? Huh? What do you want? Who are you? What family are you with?

208
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm not in anybody's family. Pipe down. It's this guy I'm talking to. So he said it's a four kids

209
00:33:50,660 --> 00:34:04,789
dub. Excuse me? What do you want from me? You say you opened shop here because Tachibana

210
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:11,300
real estate forced you out at your last location. Is that right? Oh, I see what this is. You're

211
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,409
trying to be this guy's new muscle. Oh, hell no. What? Our family's handled this cafe's protection

212
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:25,829
for 30 years. You try to swoop in on our turf, it'll mean war. Look, looks like you might need

213
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:32,949
some convincing to stay quiet while I speak to the owner here. Shut your mouth and try me. I'll kill

214
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:50,059
you. Go, go, go. Hey, Rainbow, thanks for the vibe. Give you a dirty job. Ooh. God, you just got

215
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:56,059
triple quadruple summers off him. Saying words to make the YouTube video more funny.

216
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:59,179
Saying words that are out of context to make the YouTube video funnier.

217
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:12,739
You've just got Slam-a-lam-a-ding-dong on your skull, Camarito. Say hello for the glass, ass.

218
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:24,489
Let's do it again on his little mouth. This time hit him right in the mouth.

219
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:30,550
You're my favorite YouTuber. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that. Thank you. I'm serious.

220
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:51,670
Ned Flanders? What the hell? I'm not losing to some kid. You just did. Now get lost and don't show

221
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,820
your face around this guy's shop again. Damn it. This ain't over. Why do we all, why do we talk the

222
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:06,059
same? God doesn't even realize. We all talk like this. You know what I mean? What the fuck is he

223
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,719
talking about? We can finally talk in peace. So, what in the end are you just talking in this place

224
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:17,349
as this guy squeezed me for protection, huh? Can you just leave me alone? I already said it wasn't

225
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:23,929
like that. I'm not even Yakuza. I'd just really like to talk for a minute. Talk about what? Not you

226
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:28,650
bound in real estate. Doing a little investigation. And I'd like to tell me if you know anything.

227
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,010
Anything's fine. What I know isn't a hell of a lot. Besides, I'd prefer never to deal with

228
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:55,860
those guys again. They're terrifying. Terrifying how? Too much CVT. Stop doing the H1, Z1 voice?

229
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm doing the, I'm a, I'm like a character in a television show that's animated and full of

230
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:17,349
people. Ask me for the play, kid. Hey, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.

231
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,289
You know, I haven't said that in probably seven years. PBS four kids animated voice. Well, let

232
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:29,659
me pay attention. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Where would I go if I

233
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:35,300
want to meet the guy from Tachibana's office who paid you that visit? Probably still there,

234
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,579
finishing what they started. Still where? Fuck, I'm still doing it. I'm sick though. It's my

235
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,420
excuse to talk like this because like I can do it today. I can't do it any other day because I'm not

236
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:57,000
sick. Ooh, okay. They drove most of the tenants out. The place is practically empty. And he's still

237
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,659
there. Probably. They're making him all kinds of sweet deals, but he turned down every last one.

238
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,820
He's still there now. Tachibana's boys will be too. Go have a look if you really want to get

239
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,860
mixed up with them. Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Tachibana's been running tenants out of the Hakua

240
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:22,440
building on Shichifuku Street. It's worth checking out. Thanks for the info. I just turned,

241
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,320
I turned and not paying attention, just turned and just hit my head square into this thing

242
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:49,289
and fall flat on my back and in a coma for the rest of the game. I've literally done that. I've

243
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:55,690
too. How many times have you guys in your own house somehow taken a corner too sharply

244
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:07,980
and just your shoulder just smashes into the corner like of the doorway? Yeah, it happens. It sucks.

245
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,940
But then you get really annoyed with yourself because you're like I live here. How do I not

246
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:26,139
know how to do these corners correctly? Oh my God. Hard door, hard door, hard door.

247
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:58,920
All right, come here. Hard door. Beast car door. All right, let him go. Come here. I got like stuck

248
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:06,840
on the whatever. I grabbed him over here and I couldn't like push him back and then he got away.

249
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:22,139
And then like my controller got like locked. You get this. This is a game where you get like stuck

250
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:43,289
on stuff. Notice that it's very, it's very like clingy. And here we go.

251
00:40:47,690 --> 00:41:06,440
No sticky keys? No. What if I need them? Hmm. Here we go. I can like, I can mute the microphone

252
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:38,860
and cough like 10 minutes straight. I'll be right back. Okay, hi. Okay, who's in here? I get some

253
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:59,139
story. I run the place. Wait, is this the bathroom? Why is he like opening the door like he's sitting

254
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:16,360
on the toilet? Like get out here. I'll drop you out of the building. Okay, I'll take care of that.

255
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:37,880
What is this? Hold on here. I don't even know why I'm laughing. It doesn't make any sense.

256
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,219
Off your phone? I'm not on my phone.

257
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,210
I don't want to rate Twitter. Like I don't want to rate the app. Like fuck off.

258
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:11,460
It's been like seven years since I've owned this. Like if I haven't done it yet, I'm not going to.

259
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:31,750
Streaming, shouting, pissing the halls.

260
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:41,349
Can't put the phone down to stream. Yes, I just did. I just have to check my notifications, man.

261
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:53,989
Oh, I can't wait to drag somebody's head across that bar.

262
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:24,019
He just opened that like there was a bee in his room. He just like just opened a door and run.

263
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:25,219
Eventually, maybe he'll leave.

264
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:49,639
So

265
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,639
Irma hair? Not anymore.

266
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,420
It's like the exact same haircut I had like a year ago.

267
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:31,539
Oh shit.

268
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:49,210
How much is that?

269
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,829
Oh shit, he's giving it back.

270
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,239
Oh shit.

271
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:31,030
Another two million. It's like Oprah. He's just going to be like are we going to get cars too?

272
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:49,929
Oh, it's the money that you lost at baseball.

273
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:12,119
Wait, was it a debate?

274
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,599
Wasn't even real.

275
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:54,059
I have 20 million dollars in brawler. What are you a rush guy looks like.

276
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:56,300
He pushes me really fucking hard.

277
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:15,059
Russia's op was fucked. So I picked the wrong one.

278
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:42,329
Fetish stream.

279
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,619
Sorry, I laughed when he left.

280
00:48:58,699 --> 00:48:59,900
But I'm I like brawler mode.

281
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,119
Oh shit, this is ugly.

282
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,630
Guys, hold on. I play in the bathtub. I was just rinsing my hair.

283
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:31,110
I just said I've had the conditioner in for the last 51 minutes.

284
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:52,059
I'm just shaking up a drink. I have a little drink here. I have like a little. I need to get. I don't know. Whatever. Don't leave me alone. Watch the game. I'm coughing.

285
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,559
Okay, I'm trying to be cool.

286
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,760
How did I do that? I just like shook up a drink and got like embarrassed that you heard it.

287
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:44,260
Let me pay attention. Hold on. Leave me alone. You're gonna be in big trouble.

288
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:24,730
Close chat during Kai Canyon.

289
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:29,929
I read what somebody said.

290
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,750
Okay, real estate company willing to make an enemy of the.

291
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:49,909
Of the Tojo clan, the owner of Cafe Blend may have been right about them being worse than the Yakuza.

292
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:55,269
I want a bit more info. Hopefully I can track down those other homeless guys in this neighborhood.

293
00:51:55,269 --> 00:51:58,309
Usually see them hanging around Park Boulevard and maybe I'll start there.

294
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:06,460
Find the homeless men flat on back.

295
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:18,570
Old material. It was like 20 minutes ago.

296
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,409
It's not old material if it happens in the same stream. It's a closed environment here.

297
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:37,079
Get me this. Nice heat mode.

298
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:50,739
Fuck, that happened so quickly. I don't even know what's going to happen. Use the railing.

299
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:59,110
All right, let's go. Come here. Did it work?

300
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:20,059
Yeah, come here. Yeah. Corner of the railing. Holy shit, that was a cool move.

301
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:38,469
He's crazy strong. I am. Hey, I have to ask you guys a couple of questions.

302
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:56,460
If I did, I'd be doing them myself. Speaking of, I hear Saku-san just got back from that

303
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,420
gig for a touch about real estate. Serious? Lucky bastard. You think he'd cut me in on

304
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,980
some of that if I asked him? Who knows? Can't hurt to ask. I guess he's probably over at

305
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:14,340
Public Park 3 with his buddies. I just had like a funnel in my ear leaning.

306
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:33,369
Hmm. Stop eating spaghetti in the bathtub. Why would I eat spaghetti in the bathtub?

307
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,610
It's me. Yeah, it's me. What do you want?

308
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:50,280
Oh, come on. Who am I? Hey! Oh shit, I thought this guy was attacking me.

309
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:56,230
Like, come on, dude. Please. You're too close to the fight.

310
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:16,519
You eat spaghetti in the bathtub? I don't. I feel like that's like a weird YouTube video

311
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:21,000
you watched where it was like I made a bathtub with spaghetti sauce and like ate spaghetti

312
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:29,530
in the bathtub with this with the tomato sauce or something. Oh, not this guy again.

313
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:39,300
No, just get away from me. Here. Look, I have a- here, look. Isn't this cute? You made that

314
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,539
video. No, I didn't. I made a video where like- I made a video where I sat on a gun in the bath.

315
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:50,599
Different. This is about as safe as it gets. It doesn't look like you're carrying anything

316
00:55:50,599 --> 00:56:00,650
dangerous. In the bathtub when I have like the TF2 video. How many- wait, how many of you guys

317
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,329
have like never seen any of my videos before? What's like the over-under of how many people

318
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:25,559
are here? You made videos? Tons of them. Hundreds of them, dude. Kicked somebody's bike. Sorry.

319
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:49,849
Come here. Come here. He did- he went- he hit his head on something. Why did he hit his head on?

320
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:59,369
I just unplugged that guy from his internet. Somebody's pulled the ethernet cable out when

321
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:27,030
he ran at me. Actually, I gotta save the game. Geez. Do the RC car racing? Ending machine. Yes,

322
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:45,260
sure. You pay 10,000 yen. Inokitake. Cool. I ate it? Inokitake mushrooms are recommended by

323
00:57:45,260 --> 00:58:05,800
mushroom suppliers. Cool. All right, I used it. I have to- where's my item box? Get rid of this

324
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:18,170
stuff. What is this? Tissues? All right, where's this pocket racing game you're talking about?

325
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:39,030
Do pocket racers? Is there a drug store in here? Sorry. I'll take a beef bottle down here.

326
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:55,530
The north top left of the map? Okay. You just ate mushrooms, now you want more drugs. Yeah,

327
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:12,949
whatever. Okay, north- north left. North left of map. Batting center. Disco. I don't have it. I

328
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:25,190
don't think I have it unlocked. No, I don't- I don't have that yet. You think if you made the

329
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,550
exact same sound as the person that just got bumped, if it was like somebody running down the

330
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:32,070
street they bumped into you and the person went, oh yowzers! And then they bumped into you and you

331
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:40,460
went, oh yowzers! You think you'd look at each other? Be like, dude, you- you're- do you want

332
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,119
to hang out? I feel like we kind of get each other somehow.

333
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,380
Was this supposed to be a sweet little year-end bonus this calls for toast?

334
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:14,179
Yeah, we deserve to forget all the bad crap for one day. Let's live it up. Eat your shit together.

335
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:18,340
Stop eating a candlelit dinner in the bathtub. Do not tell me how to live my life. I can do

336
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,539
whatever I want. I can do whatever the fuck I want. I can eat a candlelit dinner in the bathtub if I

337
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:32,019
feel like it. How is that hurting you? How does that hurt you? How does that hurt you? In no way

338
01:00:32,019 --> 01:01:00,119
does it affect you. You can do whatever the fuck I want. What? Hmm. If only I had some booze that

339
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:10,260
thought right out. If you're that eager to chat, buy us around. Sure, let's go. Let's do it.

340
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:14,300
Put the fuck up with dumbass boys references.

341
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:23,900
Hold on a second, folks. Ladies and gentlemen, um, you don't- that's a good show.

342
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:30,860
If you haven't seen the boys yet, fucking watch it. Like, it's a really cool- it's a good show.

343
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:35,989
It's based on a- I mean, no, no, it's not a good show. I don't like that show. I don't like the

344
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:52,679
boys. Well, I do. Comics are good, too. Yeah, I might read them. Great acting. It's like,

345
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:56,039
it's really, really all over the place. It's really, like, dark and gritty and- yeah,

346
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:01,639
oh, you said the Reddit word. It's like, dark and gritty show. Excuse me. Excuse me.

347
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:12,280
No, it's actually- well, jokes aside, it's a really good show. It's just fun to watch.

348
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:19,980
Um, Anthony Starr better get the, uh, like, an Emmy because, like, he's fucking fantastic.

349
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:33,449
Anthony Starr? Yeah, he's fantastic. He's really fun to watch. I'm being dead serious. All right,

350
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:42,940
we gotta bring him some booze. Do I have- can I just buy booze? This is a bit. Don't fall for it.

351
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:53,940
It's not a bit. All right, let's go. Let's go. Beer's easy. They sell it everywhere. Let's go get a

352
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:03,340
bunch of beer. Okay, uh, soba noodles burger shop? Wait, there's a- this- wait,

353
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:09,849
there's cheeseburgers in the game. Hold on, I didn't even see that. Talk to all of them.

354
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:24,659
All right, so you want a beer. You want a beer? What do you want? Uh, sweet potato sochu mood.

355
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:30,150
Somebody write that down. Potato sochu. Sweet potato sochu is the only sochu worth drinking.

356
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:34,789
You're one of those kids who only drinks beer. You gotta expand your horizons. You'll never get

357
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:51,190
a woman. All right, so we're getting a coke for you. Something like sake to warm you up

358
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:56,039
in the winter. Sake is that- what was that blinking over there? What was that? Check that out.

359
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:14,219
All right, yeah, I like sake. Warm sake is good. Okay, hot sake. What do you want? Champagne.

360
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:24,280
Ensy, okay. Christmas. Probably have some at Don Quixoto. Okay. You guys writing these down?

361
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:34,300
Ehehe. Ehehe. Didn't expect a free drink. Life's just great. Well, I'm a whiskey hound.

362
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:49,320
Okay. Make sure it's scotch. What does it mean? My girlfriend are watching and we want to hear

363
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:56,380
the Dutch voice. Like your anniversary or something? Is it- okay, if it's your anniversary, then

364
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:08,869
if it is, okay. Well, listen to me, Arthur. Arthur, you have to get on that train and start up a fight

365
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:27,530
with those bandits before I can get on to that train with you. Happy anniversary, guys. You got

366
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:33,030
the- no, wait, hold on, I screwed up my thing. Yeah, I'm not gonna say Goku at the end of every

367
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:43,460
one of those, man. All right, so we need champagne. Let's get this right. We need potato, drink,

368
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:55,940
champagne, scotch, beer. What was the last one? Potato drink, scotch, champagne, beer,

369
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:11,260
sake. Okay, easy. I can't just go into the- no!

370
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:20,820
I gotta get on that train so I can get on the train, Arthur, so I can get on the train with you.

371
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:25,860
Really, really reaching deep into the- hold on, I gotta call in this guy.

372
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:47,610
Giant traffic cone. Pog. I want to go to the burger place first. Do they actually have cheeseburgers?

373
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:59,260
Oh, will this be for here to go? This is for here. Free smile? What? All right, a smile burger,

374
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:07,019
smile cheeseburger with fries, teriyaki smile burger, a king smile burger. This is like a big

375
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:19,659
mac. Una burger, a smile shake. I want the smile cheeseburger set. I'm so hungry, I'm eating my

376
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:31,989
hands in anticipation. All right, what about the smile? Free smile. I have a free smile. Here it

377
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:45,130
comes. Oh, I thought the smile was like the name of the drink. Excuse me, can I have a free drink?

378
01:07:45,769 --> 01:08:07,829
You don't sell alcohol here, I'm leaving. This is a real thing, you can ask for a smile in Japanese

379
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:24,600
McDonald's. What? That's- you can? Okay, I need to get a beer, open noodles. Oh, drinks, okay.

380
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,390
Let's go up and left. So you just go- excuse me, I'd like a smile- what if you don't order anything?

381
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,829
I think that's kind of fucked up. You should have to- you should have to at least have to order food.

382
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:39,270
Otherwise, there'd be a line out the door like, can I have a smile? Sure, thanks for taking up

383
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:49,510
a fucking space in line, dickhead. Like, imagine like the- you're like in a rush, you're in a hurry,

384
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:55,270
and like the four or five people in front of you are ordering smiles for free. It's like,

385
01:08:55,270 --> 01:09:00,069
okay, that's very cute. Get the fuck out of my way. I would like to order a meal, please.

386
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:15,659
I'm- I'm gonna pay- I'm gonna be ordering food. Oh, this is beer, right? Enjoy the moment with

387
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:24,439
full body flavor. All right, so we need this as draft. This beer tastes incredible. In which

388
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:34,890
takoyaki would you like? What? Do I have to buy food with this? Takoyaki and egg. I'm too full

389
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:41,210
for this. No, I can't eat. What if I don't want this? No, I don't want to drink the guy's beer.

390
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:53,159
Wait, what? Okay, well that was not right. I go up with like five empty containers, shit face.

391
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:15,819
Did you get our orders? I sure did. Okay, you're all shit. Okay, come on. You know, do you sell

392
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:28,979
beer here? Just show up with five cartons of milk. Oolong tea. Wait, whiskey. Is it scotch?

393
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:41,739
Oh, sweet potato. That's expensive. This is $1,800. Oh, friendship. Hold on a minute.

394
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:46,500
Hold on a minute. Excuse me. You seem a little tense. I just started working here, so

395
01:10:47,859 --> 01:10:52,020
this takes a while to get used to it and learn about all the different products. Well, good luck.

396
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:59,850
Thank you, sir. How much kinder than you look. I am? What kind of look do I have then?

397
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:08,180
I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. It's fine. My name is Miho. If you come here often,

398
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,380
we'll be seeing each other a lot. So I thought I should introduce myself.

399
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:21,960
Nice to meet you, Miho. I'm Kiro. Okay, new contact. This could be the beginning of a

400
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:39,140
friendship with Miho. All right. You're cheating on bowling girl. No, here, I'm going to buy stuff

401
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:44,819
from here to talk to this girl. I'm going to bring the bag of this logo with this brand on it

402
01:11:44,819 --> 01:12:05,029
to the bowling alley. Psycho. All right, what else do they have? Delete System 32. That's not even

403
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:08,390
like, why are you even saying that anymore? It's been like 10 years since somebody did that.

404
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:14,149
You got like, okay, somebody got one person to do that like 15 years ago and people still say that.

405
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:31,529
Does this count as scotch? Get the malt. Okay, this is beer. Wait, I just have to buy things

406
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:38,069
from here and we can, all right, sure. Here. I'd like a couple more things too. I'd like some ramen.

407
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:49,670
Cool. I'd like, that's what I want from here. Every time I buy something, you like it. I'll

408
01:12:49,670 --> 01:13:02,710
take a seaweed rice ball. Cool. Okay. I'll also have a, you know, hey, I'll take a couple of,

409
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:06,390
these are expensive so I can show you that I got a little bit of cash. I'll take two of those.

410
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:20,199
Okay. Also, I'll take some health potion. I'm going to buy one at a time because it makes you

411
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:23,000
happy when I buy one item at a time and I need help anyways.

412
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:40,710
Okay, so I have a, this is a separate trip. Oh, no, that won't work. Oh, Kirsten, hello.

413
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:52,229
Oh, sorry. Thank you for shopping with us. Looks like she's got something on her mind.

414
01:13:52,789 --> 01:13:56,229
Something wrong? You look a little out of it. Oh, do I really?

415
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:02,970
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let that show, but you're right. Something's been on my mind all day.

416
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:10,149
What's that? Head office gave me an assignment of sorts. An assignment, huh? We have lots of

417
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:14,310
competition here from the M store chain and others. Our stores are all very similar,

418
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:18,789
don't you think? But think of it, I guess there's not much of a difference between your store.

419
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:23,420
That's why the head office asked employees from various branches to come up with ideas that would

420
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:31,159
set Poppo stores apart from others. That's why you're lost in thought. Okay. I don't want to

421
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:34,279
suggest something random that would only grab the customer's attention for five minutes.

422
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:45,529
Silly me, I should ask customers for their opinions. Do you have a few minutes?

423
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:53,560
No, of course I do. Great. So, Kirsten, is there something, is there anything that you would,

424
01:14:53,560 --> 01:15:05,100
God damn it. Okay. Is there anything that you would like? Oh, man. Is there anything

425
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,579
you would like our store to introduce? Let me think. What would I want at a convenience store?

426
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:20,039
I would want sofas, luxury brand goods, also delivery service. How about delivery?

427
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,550
That would be pretty good, right? Let's do delivery.

428
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:32,710
If stores all across Japan, you could use that to offer a delivery service. Oh my gosh,

429
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:36,470
that's a good idea. Why go to the post office or arrange a curry if you could mail or pick up

430
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,710
parcels at the same store you do your shopping in. Oh, I got it wrong. I thought they were going to

431
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:44,789
be delivering food and like sprites and stuff to people, not like actually do like mail,

432
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:53,770
like handle mail. Okay. It still worked. You could also offer a range of discounts

433
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:58,859
to further entice the customers. Your idea is going to be a winner. You must be a business

434
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:14,710
genius. Okay. All right. Friendship ended with bowling girl. Now store girl is my best friend.

435
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:33,289
Good one. Oh, more friendship, friendship, friendship again.

436
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:58,579
And he bought the whiskey. Almost there. Oh, I shared your suggestions about offering parcel

437
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:04,100
delivery service with that office and they jumped on the idea. I even got a raise thanks to that.

438
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:09,460
Hey, that's great. But it was your idea to begin with. So I owe you a big thank you.

439
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:20,229
I got you this. Hope y'all like it. You got a berserker charm. Oh shit. This is going to be a

440
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:25,960
new hot snack here available soon. Nice. Yeah. Congratulations. We're starting to sell this

441
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,439
today. Can you guess what it is? Let me give you a hint. It's delicious by itself or with soy sauce

442
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:37,050
or mustard. It's a specialty from the Nagoya area. It goes well with soy sauce and mustard.

443
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:51,479
It must be hot miso soup, steamed pork buns. It goes well with soy sauce and mustard. That's

444
01:17:51,479 --> 01:18:00,630
steamed pork buns. It has to be. Wait, is it cutlets? Miso cutlets with pork buns.

445
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:10,520
Probably pork, right? Mustard? Pork and mustard. They go together really well. Did I just get a

446
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:23,000
Dan's game for saying pork and mustard? It's cutlets. Dude, it's no, it's not. It's another

447
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:36,439
no, no. Cutlets. It's literally cutlets. They go together great. Don't listen to chat. Yeah,

448
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:41,699
I know. What's going on here? Cutlets is the right answer. If you're wrong, I'm going to be pissed

449
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:49,579
off the rest of the stream. Bingo. So starting today, we'll be selling yummy miso cutlets.

450
01:18:52,090 --> 01:19:09,699
Yay. Gabby J. Yay. Yay. Come on. Come on. Come on.

451
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:26,569
Where? What happened? Can't wait to try one. I really like them too. And the reward for guessing

452
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:43,500
correctly is our brand new miso cutlet lunch set. And it's only a two star. Gross. Yeah.

453
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:48,229
You give me too much credit. Besides, look at you. You become a model employee

454
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:54,390
and you're excellent at customer service as well. You think so? Well, I guess I'm not as nervous

455
01:19:54,390 --> 01:20:00,710
around customers anymore. Not only that, but the head office likes your ideas too. Who knows,

456
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:07,460
you could be the manager of this store soon. Oh, no way. I have so much more to learn before

457
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:14,020
I can even start thinking about that. But if I am getting better at my job, I have to thank you for

458
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:23,380
that. How so? You were so scary looking. Hold on. You were so scary looking that I was terrified of

459
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:28,260
you at first, but we managed to become friends. Since then, I don't get jittery around other

460
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:44,329
people anymore. Oh, I'm pretty good at doing that shit. Only friends? Yeah, whatever. I'm not that

461
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:51,369
scary, am I? Well, hee hee heart face. And there it is. And there it is. And we got a heart. We

462
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:56,810
just got a heart. Okay. Just got one. I hope I can return the favor by making Poppo your favorite

463
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:24,010
store. Please keep shopping with us. Oh, hey, it's me again. I'm here to buy things to make you

464
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:38,890
happy. I can't carry it. I have a backpack and two duffel bags and grocery bags on both arms. And

465
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:49,449
I'm just stumbling in here. Hey, hey, I'll take like a couple of Slim Jims. Can you just put them

466
01:21:49,449 --> 01:22:09,529
in my mouth? I'll open in my mouth. God damn it. All right, I'll be back. I've got to relieve

467
01:22:09,529 --> 01:22:19,180
myself of stuff so I can go back and buy stuff to make that girl happy. Here, take this. Here,

468
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:28,729
take your beer. Oh, perfect. You're a decent guy for a kid your age. Kid one? How old am I?

469
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:44,520
How old is Kiryu? 20? He's 20 years old. Damn. All right, what did you want? No, not you.

470
01:22:49,640 --> 01:23:00,939
What should I hand over? Here's the sweet potato soju. Enjoy it. How the fuck am I as old as Kiryu?

471
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:10,739
I don't know. You get the wrong attitude, kid. When an elder offers you a drink, you drink it.

472
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,699
Doesn't matter if you're a featherweight. That's the rules you want to get ahead.

473
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:24,460
Back when I was a businessman. Oh, whatever. You wanted the scotch, right? I'm really particular

474
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:29,739
about my whiskey. Oh, I didn't get scotch? That was just regular whiskey? Oh, shit.

475
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:38,439
You want... I'll have something else. Sake, right? All right, I don't have it. All right,

476
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:49,800
where can I get it? This is... Here's the drink place. Beef bowl restaurant. Bowl? Bowling?

477
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:58,500
Bowl? This is the person I'm going to talk to? Oppo? Don? There we go. Don Kyoto. All right,

478
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:18,340
we're going to be going right and then right. Oh, we got Yakuza. Did I say Kyoto? Kyoto?

479
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:40,170
Kyoto? Kiyotio? What do you say it? Kiyoti? Kiyoto? Kihote? Kiyotio? Kiyoto? Kiyoxio?

480
01:24:42,170 --> 01:25:12,420
That's Spanish. What? What do you mean that's Spanish? Don Kyoto? It's not Spanish? Oh, it is.

481
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:22,659
Don Kiyote? Don Kyoto? The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble from

482
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:30,060
La Mancha named Alsano Kizano who reads so many chivalry romances that he loses his mind and

483
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:50,140
becomes a knight. Thanks literature. Okay, let's play the video game. Shut up. N.A. education. I

484
01:25:50,140 --> 01:26:01,770
haven't been in a school desk in 20 fucking years. Give me a break. Give me the truck.

485
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:21,510
Beast mode. Beast mode. Can I pick up the truck in beast mode? Nice. You dropped out at 15.

486
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:40,579
No, I didn't. I'm just saying it's been a while. What's going on here? Oh shit. All these people

487
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:48,859
are waiting for smiles. Look, I'm just going to, I'm going to just walk by all these people

488
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:54,140
starting at the bottom with a huge toothy smile and just walk backwards looking at everybody

489
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:58,859
directly in their eyes and go, thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. All of you. Goodbye. Thank you.

490
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:03,420
And then get right in front of them, get in the right, get to the front of the fucking line.

491
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,869
I snuck off from work for this. If my manager finds out before I get back, I'm so dead.

492
01:27:23,859 --> 01:27:31,609
Hey kid. Oh, yes. What's going on? Why are all these people here? Did you want one too?

493
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:38,659
I'm really sorry, but they said I'll get the last one in stock. What are you talking about?

494
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:46,630
Aren't you lining up for an Aura Q3? Aura Q3? Is that some kind of secret code?

495
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:57,510
No, it's an Aura Q3. The newest game in the Aura Cure series. Aura Q3 short for Aura Cure 3,

496
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:01,430
quest for the quantum quill. I can't wait to read the instruction manual on my way home.

497
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:08,229
Never heard of it. People are actually lining up to buy a video game. What an amazing world we live

498
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:13,500
in. Yeah, it's the most popular game in Japan right now. I went looking for it with Papa.

499
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:20,020
They were sold out everywhere. Then my friend told me this place was getting a new batch today.

500
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,619
So I grabbed my allowance and ran all the way here. They got any 3080s in there?

501
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,810
I made it just in time and got the last reservation ticket. I'm so happy. It's

502
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:35,770
going to be the best game ever made. Times are strange if it's this hard to buy a toy.

503
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:50,970
Sorry to bug you, kid. Thanks for the info. Bye, mister. I snuck off from work. Yeah,

504
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:57,340
we already talked to you. No cutting in line, pal. You have to play by the rules

505
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:07,750
and get in the back like everyone else. I'm so glad I lined up first thing this morning.

506
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:21,340
I'm going to be the first one to get it. I just went in. Wait, does this move not know

507
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:43,460
the store is open? I'll take a Aura Q3, please. Oh, damn it. I can't just buy one. Pires? Comfy

508
01:29:43,460 --> 01:30:05,050
souls. Yeah, give me one of those. Okay. What else you got? Leather belt. Protective amulet.

509
01:30:06,409 --> 01:30:20,170
Baseball shirt. Binding. Table, salt, coin, and gun. Okay. Gentleman's umbrella. Lumber.

510
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:24,329
Pocket tissues. Gold champagne. All right. Wait, did he want the good stuff?

511
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:40,890
Just we can just get the shitty stuff, right? Hold on. Oh, dude. Force drink, force stamp,

512
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:54,020
leather belt. Oh, dude. Force drink, force stamp, leather belt. Oh, dude. Force drink,

513
01:30:54,020 --> 01:31:02,539
force stamp, leather belt. Okay. Just regular champagne, right? It's a really old meme. Yeah.

514
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:08,380
Sorry, I was on the internet like fucking 15 years ago. Got to be gold. That's too much money.

515
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:35,460
Zoomers don't get it. Oh, dude. Zoomers don't get it. Vintage. What else can I do here? Wait,

516
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:48,340
should I get the Mountain Dew? Oh, enjoying her nice Mountain Dew. Didn't we have a whole entire

517
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:54,739
stream where I got like the Mandela effect where like I said Tom Green did that and we couldn't

518
01:31:54,739 --> 01:32:05,899
find it or something? Wait, 7-up? Why are these in the game? The actual brands? That's kind of weird.

519
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:21,829
Why are they just getting Mountain Dew? I'm just getting Mountain Dew. There's a ton of brands in

520
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:31,109
the Yakuza games. How do they do that without getting in trouble? All right. This is where I

521
01:32:31,109 --> 01:32:37,350
go. Hey, do you guys sell cardboard boxes here? Yeah. Can I get like a couple of cardboard boxes,

522
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:42,579
like two or three cardboard boxes, just kind of like large squares? They're like, I guess. I mean,

523
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:48,260
that'll be like $3. Thank you. Thank you. And I buy the cardboard boxes and I just kind of get

524
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:54,140
them up from holding empty cardboard boxes. And I open the door to leave the store here and I go

525
01:32:54,699 --> 01:33:13,260
like this. I start like out of running. Just run by the line. Hmm. Is that? Game over, loser.

526
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:24,300
What? Hey, the kid that was lining up for the game, right? Did you manage to get it? Oh, Mr.

527
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:34,119
What's the matter? It's my brand new video game. That guy stole it. What? You mean that high school

528
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:40,489
kid just stole it? Oh, he just ran up and yelled at me to hand it over. He took my

529
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:46,970
RQ3. I spent all morning waiting in line too. I saved up my allowance for a really, really long

530
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:53,289
time to get it. He stole from a kid. He deserved the strongest punishment. I'll get it. I'm going

531
01:33:53,289 --> 01:33:59,779
to go get it. Here, kid. I'm going to go get that, but I can't promise that I won't smash it over his

532
01:33:59,779 --> 01:34:04,310
head. I'm going to be in beast mode. It's going to be hard for me to control my emotions,

533
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:21,380
but I will get revenge for you. I promise. Hey kid, what's your name? It's it's Akio. Akio got it.

534
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:29,350
Hang tight. I'll get your game back. You will? So there's no need to cry. Mr. Okay. I won't cry

535
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:37,640
anymore. Good. That's showing some spine, little man. I like that. Leave it to me. Yay. Thank you,

536
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:46,699
mister. At high school. Oh, he's in high school. Oh, right. No, I'm not going to smash it over his

537
01:34:46,699 --> 01:35:07,960
forget everything I just said. All right. Where is he? You get that back right now. Isn't that

538
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,779
later freak? Wait, did he just steal it from the high school kid?

539
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:26,149
They're just playing like steal the PlayStation five tag. No fair. That's the kid who took Akio's

540
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:36,020
game. Hey, you have that game. Don't you? What's it to you? My adventure just came to an abrupt end.

541
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:41,319
So leave me alone. Who can do I'll take back that our Akira you took from Akira.

542
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:46,739
RQ three. That's the last thing I want to hear about right now. Forget it. I'm going to grind

543
01:35:46,739 --> 01:36:09,930
your ass just for the experience. What? Okay, I got a trash can in the head. Get the fuck over

544
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:25,050
here, dude. Put his head in the trash can. All this over a video game. What is that? Can this

545
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:40,180
kid in high school? What the hell am I doing? Mr. That run was I just caught the guy who took

546
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:50,420
your RQ. Oh, yay. Okay, give Akira his Akira back. Man, I don't have it. Give it up already.

547
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:54,100
If you don't want another beating handed over and get a job next time you want a video game.

548
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:58,460
I told you I don't have it. I got robbed by a better thief than me.

549
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:06,550
You were robbed who? Yeah, this jerk from a street gang busted out his dagger of stealing

550
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:13,430
and made me give it to him. Oh, a dagger for strength for stamp dagger of healing.

551
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:28,180
Dagger of stealing. I mean, yeah, lame. I could be leveling up but my our Q3 is probably going

552
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:37,529
to be some dude's not even a fan of the Q3. Dagger of healing. No, no, trust me. Trust me.

553
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:41,930
When I stab you with this dagger in the stomach, you're going to feel your diarrhea is going to

554
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:53,819
go away tomorrow morning. I promise. That wasn't yours. You rob a little kid and then turn around

555
01:37:53,819 --> 01:38:00,220
and cry like a baby when you get mugged. How pathetic is that? You haven't learned your

556
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:07,460
lesson yet. You bunk. No, I'm already out of lives. Sorry, man. I'm out of here.

557
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:14,489
Didn't I just kick this guy's head into the wall as hard as I could? Being able to make like joky

558
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:19,770
video game references after all of your teeth are gone and you need like four hours of surgery to

559
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:23,770
fix your skull. Like, I mean, that's just I mean, come on. What's going on here?

560
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:38,890
All right, I'll get it back. The kid stole and stole it by some other stole somebody

561
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:56,170
and that guy went off this way. I swear to god if this guy gets robbed. Oh my god.

562
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:16,199
Oh my god. Okay. Hey, you're the guy that stole the PlayStation from the kid that stole it from

563
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:21,939
Accio. Who the hell is Accio and what if they did? I saw my chance and I took it. Yeah.

564
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:26,789
No, you robbed the kid who robbed Accio of his Arakura.

565
01:39:28,149 --> 01:39:32,470
I don't get it. Forget it. Just give back the Arakura cartridge you stole.

566
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:50,949
Ara Q3, Ara Q3. I don't want to hear another word about Ara Q3. I'm gonna stomp you. Oh, nice.

567
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:53,590
Take him up by his legs and smash his head somewhere.

568
01:39:57,689 --> 01:40:25,819
Fuck, I pressed the wrong button. Get up. Oh, I got a scratch on my arm.

569
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:35,289
There's a lady that walked on stage and she had like the arms that came in. She like did that

570
01:40:35,289 --> 01:40:47,319
walk. It's a meme. The politician. Some EU politician. Theresa May. Yeah. All right.

571
01:40:47,319 --> 01:41:02,359
He's doing like the Theresa May walk. All right. Give the Arakura. Sorry, pal, but your game got

572
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:10,149
pinched. I'm not playing around. Give the kid his game or you can suffer. Me. Suffer me now. I'm

573
01:41:10,149 --> 01:41:15,590
serious. It's really gone. Some a-hole got the jump on me. You carry around a knife. You rob

574
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:21,640
kids and stuff and you stab people, but you won't say asshole, but you'll kill people.

575
01:41:22,279 --> 01:41:31,029
Remember how we talked about earlier? You can gouge somebody's eyes out with a fucking stick.

576
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:36,119
But like saying the word fuck on TV, we're seeing it's coming full circle.

577
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:52,220
Professionals have standards. Remember your nephews are watching. My nephews are not watching

578
01:41:52,220 --> 01:42:05,029
Yakuza. This hard ass held me up at gunpoint. That guy that was just here. What a shitty day.

579
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:11,779
That guy jacked my Ara Q3. That wasn't yours. You steal from a kid then cry like a baby when

580
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:15,220
you get mugged. I'm seeing a pathetic pattern here. If this isn't getting through to you,

581
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:27,689
how about we go another round? No. No. If I'm good, I'm sorry. My Ara Q3. Don't worry. I promise I'll

582
01:42:27,689 --> 01:42:36,539
hunt it down. At this point, at this point, I'm going to be like, son, just give me one second.

583
01:42:36,539 --> 01:42:45,960
Do you ever heard of eBay? Here, I'll get one for you. What's your address? Well, the thug who took

584
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,560
Akio's Ara Q3 from the kid who stole it in the first place ended up having it taken by some

585
01:42:49,560 --> 01:43:10,460
hard ass Yakuza who went up towards the Taihei Boulevard. Let's go. It's 1988. Oh, internet

586
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:16,899
didn't exist. Well, I would just go buy one. I would just, okay, here's what I would do. Yeah,

587
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:22,899
sure. eBay didn't exist. I would stand on the corner, like right here, wherever that game store

588
01:43:22,899 --> 01:43:27,380
was. And I would just go, ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for one moment?

589
01:43:28,949 --> 01:43:37,510
If anyone has recently purchased the Ara Q3 system, I am willing to pay 20% more than what

590
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:45,529
you paid for it. I currently have $500 cash in my pocket, and I'll do it. We will do a transaction

591
01:43:45,609 --> 01:43:52,579
right now. Spread the word. I'll be here every afternoon from 2pm to 4pm Pacific.

592
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:59,859
And I would just go, I never wait till somebody showed up. You get robbed. Oh, yeah. What about

593
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:13,300
that one? Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna come rob me? Oh, excuse me. Where is it going? Sold out. Yeah,

594
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:20,100
that's why I'd be announcing it on the corner. If you're more comfortable with getting a check,

595
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:29,210
I have those too. You're finally mine Ara Q3. My quest is complete. A game you got there.

596
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:41,850
You stole it. Oh, you see this Ara Cura belongs to us. Bwa ha ha. So if you want to live, get off my

597
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:47,750
street. Listen, don't bother looking for a place that's still selling Ara Q3. Just find a fool who

598
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:58,069
bought one and take it. Villains. Every last one. What's this world coming to? Bah. What'd you say,

599
01:44:58,069 --> 01:45:05,270
boy? That Ara Cura, you're, I'm taking it from you. What's that? Take it back. So listen up, boy.

600
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:12,180
Pornography starring your mother. Don't act like it was your game to start with. Huh? Shut up,

601
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:19,100
it's complicated. I see you're an Ara Q3 hunter too then. Playtime is over. I'm not holding back.

602
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:25,829
And he has a gun. He just aims it up, excuse me, right in the forehead. Can he kill me?

603
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:58,939
Don't even let him shoot it. Why is he hitting me? You have a gun. He's using it as a melee weapon.

604
01:45:59,819 --> 01:46:10,310
This cannot be. I'll be taking that Ara Q3 with me. Hold on, please. I need that. Give it back. Come

605
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:16,010
on. Give it back? This was never yours to begin with. Bella, I'm begging you, please. My little

606
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:22,710
boy's been really looking forward to playing it. Your son? Uh, yeah. My old lady left me and took

607
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:29,380
the boy with her. He's been wanting Ara Q3. Wait a minute, is this the, is the kid's dad?

608
01:46:29,539 --> 01:46:37,619
We were looking everywhere, but there ain't none for sale anywhere. I just wanted my boy to be

609
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:44,140
happy. I'm begging you. You gotta let me have it, please. Uh, I can't do that. You probably don't

610
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:47,659
know this, but a little kid saved up his allowance and went through a lot of trouble to buy the last

611
01:46:47,659 --> 01:46:55,029
one. Huh? I didn't stick up a little kid. I just took it off some worthless goon. That's right,

612
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:59,930
you got the game from a punk, but that game belonged to a little kid first. Long story short,

613
01:47:00,729 --> 01:47:06,329
you took Ara Q3 from a wannabe punk who took it from a high school bully who took it from the last

614
01:47:06,329 --> 01:47:11,819
boy in line who bought it in the first place. And head hurts just thinking about it, but all right,

615
01:47:11,819 --> 01:47:16,470
so that's what happened. And I came to get it back for the little kid. It's gonna, going back to the

616
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:25,609
rightful owner. I'm sorry. It's gonna be the kid's dad. Bella, I'm the fool here. Give it back to that

617
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:32,949
kid for me. Damn, I was about to make someone's kid cry for the sake of my own. What kind of monster

618
01:47:32,949 --> 01:47:38,630
have I become? I thought I could make my boy happy with something I stole from someone else.

619
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:47,770
I was wrong. Am I supposed to be a good dad to my boy? Do Akio like this? Yeah. I guess you better

620
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:56,920
think about it. Wait, what? Who? Oh, hi, mister. Perfect timing, Akio. I got your Ara Q3 back.

621
01:47:57,819 --> 01:48:05,449
Oh, really? Yippee. Oh, Akio, it's you. Oh, my boy. Oh, hi, papa.

622
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:13,020
Papa? You guys are related? That's right. Are you friends with papa, mister?

623
01:48:14,199 --> 01:48:23,350
Uh, yeah, you might say that. Simpson's episode. Wait, buddy, that little kid you were telling me

624
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:37,100
about, that was his. Yeah, that seems to be how this is shaking up. Why, Akio? Why didn't you say

625
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:42,279
anything to your papa? All you had to do was ask. I could have given you the money to buy Ara Q3

626
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:49,420
any time you smashed his dad's brain into the pavement in front of him. Hey,

627
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:57,720
Jerma sucks. Thanks for the 10 community subs. I beg to differ because mama always gets mad at

628
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:04,460
you, papa, for spending money on golfing and go-karts and board games. And I didn't want

629
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:08,779
mama to get mad at you even more for spending all your money again, papa. So I tried to buy it myself.

630
01:49:10,569 --> 01:49:16,180
Akio, I just like did a huge burp. I'm sorry. Did you guys hear that? I hope you didn't.

631
01:49:16,819 --> 01:49:22,659
That just hurt. It came out of my nostrils. I just leaned back and went,

632
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:29,939
and it came out of my eyes. It went through my sinuses. That hurt. I'm sorry. Mr. Papa looks

633
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:37,850
kind of scary, but he's a really, really nice man once you get to know him. Ew. Don't share that. I

634
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:46,300
share everything. He took me to a bunch of game stores just the other day. He's not living with

635
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:53,960
mama and me now. I think he's lonely. Please stay friends with him, okay? Actually, Akio,

636
01:49:53,960 --> 01:50:01,989
your papa helped me get your RQ3 back. Yeah, that's right. He did. And his dad smiles,

637
01:50:01,989 --> 01:50:06,229
a big smile, which just bruises all over his face and like four of his teeth fall out and like

638
01:50:06,229 --> 01:50:21,000
bloods all over his mouth. Really? Thank you, papa. I did in a way. I don't want to see you crying

639
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:31,449
again. Nice Looney Tunes joke. Yeah. I think that actually happens like every three episodes.

640
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:40,729
How many times has Davy Duck's teeth fallen out of his mouth after getting like smashed in the head

641
01:50:40,729 --> 01:50:48,310
with a board? I don't want to see you crying. Be careful going home with your game. Yep. Got it.

642
01:50:48,310 --> 01:51:00,649
Thank you, mister. Hey, mister. Thanks. This is to apologize or to thank you for teaching this fool a

643
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:16,100
lesson. Maybe whatever. I want you to have it. Got a sunburst. Holy shit. What was that? Is that a

644
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:22,329
katana? A sword? I now want to be a good dad all the time, not just in front of Akio.

645
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:25,770
You don't want to do anything that'll make kids sad, no matter whose kids they are.

646
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:33,270
Yeah, you got that right. Papa, this is too hard for me all by myself. Let's go to mama's house

647
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:47,619
and play RQ3 to go. Oh, my heart is exploding. Oh, without the expert advice, without my expert

648
01:51:47,619 --> 01:51:54,119
advice, we'll be making a beeline to that nasty demon lord in no time. That's how a game should

649
01:51:54,119 --> 01:52:11,859
be played. There it is. That was very, I loved that. That was wonderful. That was wonderful.

650
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:23,029
I got a sword out of it, too. All right. What was I doing? Oh, yeah. I need to give shampoo.

651
01:52:23,029 --> 01:52:39,460
Do I, where do I get the champagne? I have, uh, what did I get? Did I get a golden champagne?

652
01:52:39,460 --> 01:53:08,069
Where is it? You didn't buy it. What? I didn't buy it? Really? I thought I bought it. Oh, come on.

653
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:10,869
Really? All right. Well, I did that quest. That was cool. So let's be going to go straight and

654
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:16,619
then go right and then right. Sorry. I don't want to be like a coughing Andy.

655
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:43,270
Yeah, I want to make sure I said this again. For those of you that don't, I'm sick. I'm a little

656
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:49,579
sick. Just trying to stream around being sick. I was tested for COVID. I'm negative for COVID.

657
01:53:49,579 --> 01:53:52,699
So I just want to make that clear. For those of you that might be concerned,

658
01:53:53,659 --> 01:54:02,420
I haven't tested. I'm negative. Uh, where is this place? It's right here, right? Wrong side.

659
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:20,220
Wrong side. Wrong side. Wrong side. Wrong side. Okay. Give me something, please.

660
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:41,560
Okay. I have. So do I actually have to buy the gold one?

661
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:52,020
Dear Jerma, sorry for being, what? How's this coffee cost? Hold on. Dear Jerma, sorry for

662
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:55,619
being off topic, but upon reviewing a recent VOD, I noticed a peculiar claim you made.

663
01:54:56,260 --> 01:55:00,739
You claim that you rubbed your body wash on your chest to build up a good lather, which you could

664
01:55:00,739 --> 01:55:05,619
then use on other parts of the body. The ability to build lather is determined by surface area,

665
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:10,340
meaning you must have significant surface area already on your chest. The only explanation for

666
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:21,340
the, this would be a large amount of chest hair. Um, no, that's not accurate. I don't have like a

667
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:33,140
lot of chest hair. No, I don't have a lot of chest hair. I really don't. I have, they kind of sprout

668
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:38,329
up a little bit and I just go and I just pull them with like a pair of tweezers. Cause nobody

669
01:55:38,329 --> 01:55:44,579
wants to have like eight chest hairs, right? Like, no, get rid of them. I have like 12, eight to

670
01:55:44,579 --> 01:55:51,770
12 chest hairs and I just kind of look in the mirror and I go and just pull them. My eyebrows,

671
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:58,680

01:56:23,239 --> 01:56:37,029
You know, I don't want to have like the, I have this wild hair, wild everywhere. Next topic. Oh,

678
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:06,279
eyebrows. I like get my eyebrows done. Cause I, I, I, I get like my hands and feet done too.

679
01:57:07,159 --> 01:57:12,039

TLC. Uh, okay. I'm going to give the champagne to the guy. THC.

683
01:57:56,550 --> 01:58:08,359
Chest hair is gross. I don't have chest hair. Didn't I just sprint? Why is it? Oh, okay. I

684
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:12,810
pluck my nose here. Yeah. I got to take care of those too. But be careful. Be careful. I'm

685
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:16,250
going to give you guys some tips here. If you're going to take care of your nose hairs,

686
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:21,449
just, just trim them down to like the edge of where your, your nostrils are.

687
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:24,729
Cause you can end up with a problem. I've had this happen before. This is not a joke.

688
01:58:25,369 --> 01:58:30,810
If you do, if you go too far in and you trim too much, you can actually get an ingrown hair

689
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:38,810
in your nose. And, and I've had, this has happened to me twice. I have trimmed my nose hairs to a

690
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:44,970
point where I got an ingrown in my nose and this shit came out the other side of my nose.

691
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:53,770
It was so painful. I had an ingrown inside of my nose and it grew. It went out the front of my

692
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:59,609
nose and I had to pull it out. It was horrible. It was horrible. Please, please. If you're going

693
01:58:59,609 --> 01:59:04,890
to trim your nose hairs, do it just to the edge of where your nose hairs are about to touch your

694
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:15,180
nostrils. Please don't go just you'll end up like me. It was awful. It's happened twice. Please.

695
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:23,829
I'm just trying to help you guys, trying to help you out. I don't pluck my nose hairs either. No,

696
01:59:23,829 --> 01:59:29,420
I don't do that either. That same thing can happen. You do, you trim, just trim so they don't like,

697
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:33,579
like all coming out. Then you can't see them. You know, it's fine. I'm giving you tips.

698
01:59:34,539 --> 01:59:53,739
Guess what? My tips, I'm going to give them to you. Nobody asked. Did nobody ask? Did nobody ask

699
01:59:53,739 --> 02:00:02,659
this? Why do we start talking about this? How about this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You ain't

700
02:00:02,659 --> 02:00:13,109
going to get those tips. Nope. I'm not going to say that one. Where do I get the scotch?

701
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:27,460
And you want sake. Where do I get the sake? Just one, please. We need to know.

702
02:00:32,899 --> 02:00:40,630
Please just tell us. Please give us a secret. I'm not going to take tissues from some random

703
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:53,770
person on the street. Just one tip. One, please. No, sorry. I don't give those out. I don't give

704
02:00:53,770 --> 02:01:12,380

Oh my gosh, drink something in front of them.

Just eat this and drink, just drink the Mountain Dew.

721
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:27,310
That was a scuffed impression.

722
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:28,310
That wasn't a real impression.

723
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:30,149
You want me to do my real Trump?

724
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:32,029

You can't LUL in minus two.

You can't do that.

739
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:15,100
That's not fair.

740
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:26,489
That's not fair to me.

741
02:05:26,489 --> 02:05:28,600
That's not fair.

742
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,319
You can't do that.

This is the only store up here.

750
02:05:57,619 --> 02:05:58,899
You didn't buy the sake.

751
02:05:58,899 --> 02:06:00,510

752
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,800

753
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,720
What?

754
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,079
That's not even possible.

Oh, okay.

02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,460
Here's a tip for you.

839
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:02,920
Just relax, relax, relax.

840
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:05,479
You're gonna, what you're gonna do is you're gonna,

841
02:11:05,479 --> 02:11:06,399
you're in the bathroom.

842
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:07,479
Just chill, chill.

843
02:11:07,479 --> 02:11:08,319
It's gonna be fine.

844
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:10,659
Just relax, be comfortable.

845
02:11:10,659 --> 02:11:11,899
You're gonna look in the mirror.

846
02:11:11,899 --> 02:11:13,460
You're gonna get a bunch of water in your hands like this.

847
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:14,300
Water, water.

848
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:15,460
They go to the sink.

849
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:16,779
Tons of water.

850
02:11:16,779 --> 02:11:17,619
Throw it in your face.

851
02:11:17,619 --> 02:11:18,439
Water, water, water.

852
02:11:18,439 --> 02:11:19,579
All in your hair too.

853
02:11:19,579 --> 02:11:20,539
Slick your hair back.

854
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:21,659
Make sure there's water like dripping down

855
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:23,659
from your head and face and stuff.

856
02:11:23,659 --> 02:11:24,979
So you're covered in water and you're like,

857
02:11:24,979 --> 02:11:27,899
okay, it'll be nice, it's cooling you off a little.

858
02:11:27,899 --> 02:11:28,739
Then I want you to do,

859
02:11:28,859 --> 02:11:29,699
is I want you to just get some,

860
02:11:29,699 --> 02:11:30,539
we'll get a moisturizer.

861
02:11:30,539 --> 02:11:31,859
Dry your hands, get a moisturizer.

862
02:11:31,859 --> 02:11:33,300
Get moisturizer like all over your hands

863
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:35,500
and all over your arms and wrists and neck and face

864
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,739
and like just tons of it, like a lot of it.

865
02:11:37,739 --> 02:11:39,180
Like if you have like the big tub of it.

866
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:40,180
Just make sure it's like all over you

867
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:41,460
so you can like get like moisturizer

868
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:44,960
and be comfortable and calm.

869
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:47,560
Then what I want you to do is I want you to,

870
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,880
I want you to just slowly open the door

871
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,319
and I want you to start singing.

872
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:51,399
I want you to go.

873
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:56,039
Hello, my love.

874
02:11:56,039 --> 02:12:01,039
I am here to have some fun with you

875
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:03,199
and me.

876
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:07,199
We'll see our destiny while we're in love.

877
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:20,859
And let me know how it goes.

878
02:12:20,859 --> 02:12:22,300
And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna crouch down.

879
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:27,300
You're gonna start running around the room as a dog

880
02:12:27,819 --> 02:12:29,180
on all fours, just going like.

881
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:36,359
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

882
02:12:36,359 --> 02:12:39,600
And do your best Scooby-Doo impression and go,

883
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:51,460
I'm ready.

884
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,420
Remember this 8,000 people watching.

885
02:13:02,909 --> 02:13:03,829
Oh shit, that's right.

886
02:13:03,829 --> 02:13:06,149
Sometimes I forget that it's not like three people here.

887
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:07,550
Just like in a Skype call.

888
02:13:10,449 --> 02:13:12,289
I seriously forget that sometimes.

889
02:13:12,289 --> 02:13:16,609
I forget it's not just like me, boo, stealth and star.

890
02:13:16,609 --> 02:13:18,609
Just like in italics.

891
02:13:18,609 --> 02:13:19,729
Oops.

892
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:43,670
Oh, whatever.

893
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:45,270
All right, I gotta go in here.

894
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,359
Oh shit.

895
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:12,090
And make sure, no, I'm done, I'm done.

896
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:13,729
This is gonna escalate.

897
02:14:13,729 --> 02:14:15,130
I'm gonna escalate this until like

898
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:17,289
a bunch of people will fucking leave.

899
02:14:17,289 --> 02:14:19,489
Okay, we're gonna just, what am I buying?

900
02:14:19,489 --> 02:14:20,329
Scotch.

901
02:14:23,939 --> 02:14:26,020
Did I not buy it?

902
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:27,060
I bought it, right?

903
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:38,569
I can't, I'm not doing it anymore.

904
02:14:38,569 --> 02:14:39,770
We're playing Yakuza.

905
02:14:42,489 --> 02:14:43,569
You fucking drank it.

906
02:14:43,569 --> 02:14:59,399
I bought another one, I'm fine.

907
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:01,279
They know we're gonna leave.

908
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:06,739
Hey, you had to click the mature,

909
02:15:06,739 --> 02:15:09,939
listen, you clicked the mature audience filter before.

910
02:15:09,939 --> 02:15:11,060
This is a mature screen.

911
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:13,619
We talk about mature topics sometimes.

912
02:15:17,859 --> 02:15:19,260
Oh, nice dodge, dude.

913
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:33,470
He almost just kicked his friend in the face.

914
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:36,350
He just kicked me right in the groin.

915
02:15:36,350 --> 02:15:38,939
I wanna do it to the pole.

916
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:41,699
I wanna smash him on the pole so bad.

917
02:15:47,699 --> 02:15:50,869
Why won't that work?

918
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:52,949
Oh, I got him from behind?

919
02:15:52,949 --> 02:15:54,069
Into the pole.

920
02:15:54,069 --> 02:16:06,489
Smash his face into, no.

921
02:16:06,489 --> 02:16:12,140
Stop it, stop it.

922
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:12,979
Dead.

923
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:17,819
I have to return these items to these people.

924
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:20,310
Where are the tips?

925
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:21,149
I already gave them.

926
02:16:39,739 --> 02:16:41,620
I'm stuck, you get stuck in Yakuza.

927
02:16:54,829 --> 02:16:55,670
Get over here.

928
02:17:05,209 --> 02:17:06,979
Right in the face.

929
02:17:06,979 --> 02:17:08,940
Oh, goodbye.

930
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:09,979
Goodbye.

931
02:17:15,729 --> 02:17:20,020
Go read an analog clock.

932
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:20,860
Why do I feel like that?

933
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:21,739
Okay, I know what you're saying,

934
02:17:21,739 --> 02:17:23,459
but why do I feel like that's like a boomer reference

935
02:17:23,459 --> 02:17:24,299
or something?

936
02:17:25,219 --> 02:17:27,620
Like, okay, boomer, why don't you go read an analog clock

937
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:28,700
and you're studying.

938
02:17:41,809 --> 02:17:43,649
Okay, here's your sake.

939
02:17:43,649 --> 02:17:45,930
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to.

940
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:47,649
I'm gonna say sake.

941
02:17:47,649 --> 02:17:48,489
Sorry.

942
02:17:58,850 --> 02:18:00,500
What?

943
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,319
Oh, no, it's the other guy.

944
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:04,450
Got your scotch whiskey.

945
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:05,770
I got your scotch here.

946
02:18:06,569 --> 02:18:07,850
Scotch whiskey.

947
02:18:23,979 --> 02:18:26,180
Oh, booze really is the water of life.

948
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:32,809
Okay, I'm sorry.

949
02:18:32,809 --> 02:18:34,850
I'm sorry, I'm looking like sniffily.

950
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:35,889
I know people hate that shit

951
02:18:35,889 --> 02:18:38,290
and I know I'm like streaming sick and I'm sorry

952
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:40,850
and I'll talk, I'll take tomorrow off, I promise.

953
02:18:53,719 --> 02:18:57,680
I heard you've worked at the Chibana real estate company.

954
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,520
Ugh.

955
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:01,360
Yeah, I've been sitting in the same place all day.

956
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:02,600
Don't you fucking dare.

957
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:06,000
I'm just a simple part-time job.

958
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,159
I need a doctor's note.

959
02:19:07,159 --> 02:19:10,840
I just got my first check and I got a second one.

960
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:13,600
I'm gonna sit in a different place tomorrow.

961
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:19,129
You've been doing this all this time, right?

962
02:19:19,129 --> 02:19:20,290
I've seen it too, so I know.

963
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:21,250
I'm going to the doctor's office.

964
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,569
Yeah, I need a doctor's note.

965
02:19:22,569 --> 02:19:23,409
You know that?

966
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:25,090
You need a doctor's note for work?

967
02:19:25,090 --> 02:19:27,729
Um, I mean, kinda.

968
02:19:27,729 --> 02:19:28,729
Should I call it that?

969
02:19:30,129 --> 02:19:31,969
What are you talking about?

970
02:19:31,969 --> 02:19:34,170
Oh, I make like jokey pretend sex tips

971
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:36,329
to like a bunch of people on the internet.

972
02:19:36,329 --> 02:19:38,530
And then I play a video game in the background.

973
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:43,850
Sure, I guess that could be work.

974
02:19:47,889 --> 02:19:49,209
Pretend, pretend?

975
02:19:49,209 --> 02:19:51,250
Oh, that was real?

976
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:52,209
I just can tell the doctor that

977
02:19:52,209 --> 02:19:54,010
so he doesn't think I'm weird, right?

978
02:19:58,469 --> 02:19:59,309
And he leans in and goes,

979
02:19:59,309 --> 02:20:01,829
by the way, you're talking about sex tips.

980
02:20:01,829 --> 02:20:02,670
What are they?

981
02:20:04,430 --> 02:20:06,909
I gotta spice things up with me and my life.

982
02:20:06,909 --> 02:20:08,750
What would you suggest?

983
02:20:10,379 --> 02:20:13,260
Oh, that's Champion Street, right?

984
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:16,260
I see you're doing well.

985
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:19,860
That area is now the mecca of self-reliance.

986
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:21,700
It's just a small bar.

987
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:22,540
Bro.

988
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:27,979
And the camera pans back, coming out of the office,

989
02:20:27,979 --> 02:20:31,579
and I'm like, hey, you ever seen Scooby-Doo?

990
02:20:31,579 --> 02:20:32,940
And then they are like the clapping,

991
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:34,780
the studio audience is clapping and laughing,

992
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:36,659
and then we fade out to the credits.

993
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:39,540
That area is not only for the Tachibana people,

994
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:43,159
but also for the people of the Tojo Clan.

995
02:20:43,159 --> 02:20:45,719
If a yakuza like you goes there,

996
02:20:45,719 --> 02:20:49,840
the people there will hate you.

997
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,000
I see.

998
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,879
That's helpful.

999
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:53,920
Thank you.

1000
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,239
Made by Dick Wolf.

1001
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:58,770
The Champion District.

1002
02:20:58,770 --> 02:21:04,620
That may be my ticket to bumping into Tachibana's boys again.

1003
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:05,459
It's the tweet.

1004
02:21:05,459 --> 02:21:06,280
All I need is the tweet.

1005
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:07,120
I don't care about anything else.

1006
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:07,959
I got the tweet.

1007
02:21:07,959 --> 02:21:08,780
I got the lore tweet.

1008
02:21:08,979 --> 02:21:10,889
Ooh, hold on.

1009
02:21:10,889 --> 02:21:11,729
Is that you, boy?

1010
02:21:11,729 --> 02:21:15,040
Isn't it over here?

1011
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,479
Oh, it's Glockus.

1012
02:21:17,479 --> 02:21:18,760
Perfect timing.

1013
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,719
There's something I need to talk to you about.

1014
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:22,159
I'll wait for you back here.

1015
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:33,610
Do I care about what he has to say right now?

1016
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:36,489
Look, I heard you're giving out sex tips.

1017
02:21:36,489 --> 02:21:38,569
We're in an alley, nobody can hear us.

1018
02:21:38,569 --> 02:21:43,920
Give me a good one.

1019
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,200
We're the only way somewhere, boy.

1020
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,829
Sorry to hold you up.

1021
02:21:48,829 --> 02:21:50,670
Yeah, you wanna talk?

1022
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:52,069
That's right, tell me.

1023
02:21:52,069 --> 02:21:54,139
Have you been training?

1024
02:21:54,139 --> 02:21:56,100
Yeah, here and there.

1025
02:21:56,899 --> 02:21:59,899
Good, because I have something I'd like to ask you to do.

1026
02:21:59,899 --> 02:22:02,459
If you're willing, that is.

1027
02:22:02,459 --> 02:22:04,340
What's with the hesitation?

1028
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:06,319
That's not like you.

1029
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:08,920
Truth is, I've got debt collectors on me tail.

1030
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:11,319
Scary ones.

1031
02:22:11,319 --> 02:22:14,200
Yeah, I gather you've been running since we met.

1032
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:17,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1033
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:21,120
Those two-bit jokers are nickel and dime stuff.

1034
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,639
I'm talking tunas.

1035
02:22:22,639 --> 02:22:25,959
Famous, and I mean that in the global sense.

1036
02:22:25,959 --> 02:22:27,680
And now they're here in Japan.

1037
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:30,079
Hot on my tail.

1038
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:32,379
Blond, did you seriously try to escape

1039
02:22:32,379 --> 02:22:35,920
your mountain of debt by fleeing to Japan?

1040
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,639
Yes, and this time, they may be no going back.

1041
02:22:39,639 --> 02:22:42,700
I think there's a price on my head.

1042
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:46,020
I guess it's too late to pay the money back then.

1043
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:49,170
What are you going to do, Bacchus?

1044
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:52,989
Well, I was hoping I could get you to be my bodyguard.

1045
02:22:52,989 --> 02:22:54,590
Figured as much.

1046
02:22:54,590 --> 02:22:59,649
Unfortunately, I've already got enough trouble on my plate.

1047
02:22:59,649 --> 02:23:01,370
Believe me, you'd probably be in a worse danger

1048
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:03,510
with me around anyways.

1049
02:23:03,549 --> 02:23:08,020
Oh, no, that's in no way to have a part, please.

1050
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:10,459
Sure, I can't pay retainer, but if you protect me,

1051
02:23:10,459 --> 02:23:13,180
I'll teach you some of my top shelf moves.

1052
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:14,889
They're good stuff.

1053
02:23:14,889 --> 02:23:16,170
Ooh, wait, what?

1054
02:23:16,170 --> 02:23:17,850
We're going to get tips?

1055
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:19,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on,

1056
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:20,930
wait, wait, wait, wait, you're going to flip this on me?

1057
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:25,120
I got, are these moves better than my moves?

1058
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:26,680
Damn straight, they are.

1059
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:29,649
That'll do you right in a tight fight, me boy.

1060
02:23:29,649 --> 02:23:31,620
Oh, okay.

1061
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:34,079
Are you Bacchus?

1062
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:44,459
I think they found me, boy.

1063
02:23:44,459 --> 02:23:48,030
This is the big scary debt collector, huh?

1064
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:49,569
I'm here for your head.

1065
02:23:49,569 --> 02:23:51,090
Just doing my job.

1066
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:52,729
So don't hold it against me.

1067
02:23:52,729 --> 02:23:53,940
Nanny?

1068
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:55,100
Debt collector, huh?

1069
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:58,030
More like Hitman.

1070
02:23:58,030 --> 02:24:00,129
Oh, you're looking forward to that one too.

1071
02:24:00,129 --> 02:24:04,170
Did you hear that the PSVR is the only version it'll be on?

1072
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:07,940
And it's only going to be on the PS4 version of Hitman 3?

1073
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:10,100
That immediately deduces a full retrograde

1074
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:11,899
from that fucking game.

1075
02:24:11,899 --> 02:24:13,139
I can't believe it either.

1076
02:24:13,139 --> 02:24:16,360
It's a stupid decision.

1077
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:25,040
Please help me.

1078
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:26,719
I guess I don't have much of a choice if I left you here.

1079
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:28,840
I'd be putting a bullet in your head myself.

1080
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:32,280
Stand back, get out of here.

1081
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:33,399
No, settle down.

1082
02:24:33,399 --> 02:24:35,520
All right, actually delete that one.

1083
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,760
Delete that one.

1084
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:38,260
For real, delete it.

1085
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,639
Delete it.

1086
02:24:39,639 --> 02:24:43,000
You're protecting this guy?

1087
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,829
For now, I don't especially feel like watching him die.

1088
02:24:47,829 --> 02:24:49,149
I see, fine.

1089
02:24:49,149 --> 02:24:52,469
There may be not a price on your head,

1090
02:24:52,469 --> 02:24:55,629
but I'll see if I can swing a bonus afterwards.

1091
02:24:55,629 --> 02:24:57,829
Crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle,

1092
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,610
crack knuckle, crack crack.

1093
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:01,899
Here we go.

1094
02:25:01,899 --> 02:25:07,500
Way ahead of you, old man.

1095
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:12,440
Mysterious Hitman.

1096
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:15,889
Come on.

1097
02:25:15,889 --> 02:25:19,629
Oh, that's all it takes.

1098
02:25:20,709 --> 02:25:22,510
You just have to shoot you for real.

1099
02:25:26,850 --> 02:25:28,489
Don't shoot me with that.

1100
02:25:28,489 --> 02:25:29,850
Get off me.

1101
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:30,690
Oh.

1102
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:40,620
Give me this.

1103
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:41,459
Oh shit.

1104
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:57,030
Get off.

1105
02:25:57,030 --> 02:25:57,870
What's that, nails?

1106
02:25:57,870 --> 02:26:08,170
Wait.

1107
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:19,850
Use the sword.

1108
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:21,620
Gah.

1109
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:23,520
I'm letting you live.

1110
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:26,440
You go back and tell whoever ordered the hit

1111
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:29,280
to forget about Bacchus.

1112
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,120
You hear me?

1113
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:44,430
There'll be others on this trail soon enough.

1114
02:26:44,430 --> 02:26:46,579
They'll get what's coming to him.

1115
02:26:46,579 --> 02:26:49,389
This is the worst Yakuza dub.

1116
02:26:49,389 --> 02:26:50,629
You think so?

1117
02:26:50,629 --> 02:26:52,149
All right, that's a one guy moment.

1118
02:26:52,149 --> 02:26:54,549
I'm fucking gonna actually try really hard here.

1119
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:58,940
There'll be others on this trail soon enough.

1120
02:26:58,940 --> 02:27:01,280
You'll get what's coming to him.

1121
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,959
Hold on, you stay right fucking there.

1122
02:27:04,959 --> 02:27:05,799
Don't leave the stream.

1123
02:27:05,799 --> 02:27:09,319
I saw your name.

1124
02:27:09,319 --> 02:27:11,229
Sorry, boy.

1125
02:27:11,229 --> 02:27:13,159
Why the apology?

1126
02:27:13,159 --> 02:27:15,239
I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.

1127
02:27:15,239 --> 02:27:16,360
Hey, you, hold on.

1128
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:17,700
Now you're in my head.

1129
02:27:19,659 --> 02:27:20,899
I told you.

1130
02:27:20,899 --> 02:27:23,340
I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.

1131
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:26,799
And here I am putting you in danger myself.

1132
02:27:26,799 --> 02:27:28,299
Don't worry about that.

1133
02:27:28,299 --> 02:27:31,299
I'd rather hear more about the offer you made earlier.

1134
02:27:31,299 --> 02:27:32,139
This is bad.

1135
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:36,379
You said you'd teach me some new moves.

1136
02:27:36,379 --> 02:27:37,659
Better make it quick though

1137
02:27:37,659 --> 02:27:39,260
before the next Hitman gets here.

1138
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:43,670
You sure about this, boy?

1139
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:47,190
I don't have much of a choice.

1140
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:48,909
Like that person's in my head now.

1141
02:27:48,909 --> 02:27:51,190
I can just see this is the worst dub ever.

1142
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:53,030
It's just flashing in front of my head.

1143
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:56,620
I don't have much choice.

1144
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:59,540
Like I said, I've got my own problems.

1145
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:02,020
So a few extra survival skills would come in handy.

1146
02:28:04,739 --> 02:28:07,219
All right, then let me fill you in on some moves

1147
02:28:07,219 --> 02:28:09,379
that'll send those Hitman reeling.

1148
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:18,739
Hey, boy.

1149
02:28:18,739 --> 02:28:25,239
You ready to learn my moves?

1150
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:29,219
These are the moves I can teach you, boy.

1151
02:28:29,219 --> 02:28:31,860
What's the, yeah, what's the key to brawling?

1152
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:32,780
Yes.

1153
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:34,180
Yes.

1154
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:35,379
Yes.

1155
02:28:35,379 --> 02:28:36,500
Okay.

1156
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:39,100
The most important thing in a fight is tenacity.

1157
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:40,059
That's the secret.

1158
02:28:40,979 --> 02:28:43,020
Sounds pretty simple for a secret.

1159
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:45,940
Though I guess in a fight, simplicity is best.

1160
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:48,500
Brawling comes down to spirit in the end.

1161
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:52,399
So I'm going to teach you a move that harnesses that power.

1162
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:55,819
I call it spirit fire.

1163
02:28:55,819 --> 02:28:58,129
Spirit fire?

1164
02:28:58,129 --> 02:28:59,549
Interesting.

1165
02:28:59,549 --> 02:29:01,270
So you use the force of an enemy's blow

1166
02:29:01,270 --> 02:29:03,629
to strike them back with twice the power?

1167
02:29:03,629 --> 02:29:04,629
Yes.

1168
02:29:04,629 --> 02:29:06,110
Yes.

1169
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:10,780
I'm sure you'll be able to make use of it.

1170
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:15,700
Hey, you're Bacchus, right?

1171
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:17,540
Oh, another guy.

1172
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:21,440
It's one of those Japanese hooligans.

1173
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:23,360
You call yourself an assassin?

1174
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:26,860
You look about as pro as some sorry street punk.

1175
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:29,059
I don't really know what's going on here,

1176
02:29:29,059 --> 02:29:30,819
but I just got paid a fortune up front

1177
02:29:30,819 --> 02:29:33,979
by some guy in chat, a one guy.

1178
02:29:33,979 --> 02:29:37,200
I get the rest once the job's done.

1179
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:41,020
Oh, so he's a street fighter on a freelance job.

1180
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:43,610
He doesn't look so tough.

1181
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:44,690
Shut it.

1182
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:47,370
I may not look like much, but I've never lost a fight.

1183
02:29:47,370 --> 02:29:49,290
Time to earn this cash.

1184
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:51,770
Please don't smash my head over and over again into the wall.

1185
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:53,209
Please don't use a bike on me

1186
02:29:53,209 --> 02:29:55,850
and smash the bike over my head and get a million dollars.

1187
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:57,329
Don't kick me in the head while I'm on the ground

1188
02:29:57,329 --> 02:29:58,829
and crush my head.

1189
02:29:58,829 --> 02:30:03,270
Let's go, you fucking loser.

1190
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:04,590
I think you've got the tenacity to win.

1191
02:30:04,590 --> 02:30:07,809
This is the perfect chance, boy.

1192
02:30:07,809 --> 02:30:08,850
Yeah.

1193
02:30:08,850 --> 02:30:11,739
Time to try out that move I just learned.

1194
02:30:11,739 --> 02:30:12,579
What?

1195
02:30:14,459 --> 02:30:15,899
You want some first, do you?

1196
02:30:15,899 --> 02:30:28,139
All right, open up, sir, I'll serve you your tea.

1197
02:30:28,139 --> 02:30:33,829
Oops, I just skipped it.

1198
02:30:33,829 --> 02:30:37,299
Holy shit, what, I have a gun too?

1199
02:30:37,299 --> 02:30:41,610
Wait, what, I have a weapon?

1200
02:30:41,610 --> 02:30:42,930
You can charge up a counterattack.

1201
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:46,319
The attack's more powerful and likely to knock the opponent.

1202
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:47,399
Start.

1203
02:30:47,479 --> 02:30:48,719
Start.

1204
02:30:48,719 --> 02:30:50,840
Hold down X or Y after being attacked.

1205
02:31:07,059 --> 02:31:08,139
Okay.

1206
02:31:08,139 --> 02:31:10,659
Defeat the Hitman, targeting Bacchus.

1207
02:31:10,659 --> 02:31:17,559
Use your brawler style of moves to take out the assassin.

1208
02:31:17,559 --> 02:31:21,219
What, I'm trying to counterattack.

1209
02:31:21,219 --> 02:31:35,149
I want to do the thing that just toppled.

1210
02:31:35,149 --> 02:31:35,989
You want to do that?

1211
02:31:35,989 --> 02:31:44,659
Throw him into the trash.

1212
02:31:44,659 --> 02:31:51,340
Oh, just, can I just shoot him?

1213
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:00,770
Oh, dog, dog, dog.

1214
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:10,680
Right face.

1215
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:12,040
Yeah, all right, let's go.

1216
02:32:16,469 --> 02:32:19,739
Should have saved up, that was a mistake.

1217
02:32:19,739 --> 02:32:21,180
Holy shit, that dodge though.

1218
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,760
I'm gonna die, wait.

1219
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:32,059
Step on his head.

1220
02:32:32,059 --> 02:32:33,459
Run, run, run, run, kick.

1221
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,600
Tried to grab me, didn't you?

1222
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:44,799
Nope.

1223
02:32:44,799 --> 02:32:45,639
Over here.

1224
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:00,639
I might have no more drink.

1225
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:04,459
Happy holidays, happy holidays to you too.

1226
02:33:04,459 --> 02:33:05,989
Boy wins.

1227
02:33:05,989 --> 02:33:06,950
Hey.

1228
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:07,870
Yeah?

1229
02:33:07,870 --> 02:33:09,590
What?

1230
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:12,750
What did the guy that paid you look like?

1231
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:14,350
It was dark, I didn't get a good look at their face.

1232
02:33:14,350 --> 02:33:15,989
From the way they talked, I guess they were foreign.

1233
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:18,579
Was it me?

1234
02:33:18,579 --> 02:33:19,700
Of course not, yeah, it was him.

1235
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:24,399
It was, oh, did you guys hear that?

1236
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:29,049
There was like a person talking out of my throat.

1237
02:33:29,049 --> 02:33:30,409
It was like, no, it wasn't.

1238
02:33:30,409 --> 02:33:31,649
Nope.

1239
02:33:31,649 --> 02:33:33,459
Did anybody hear that?

1240
02:33:33,459 --> 02:33:36,649
Maybe my noise gate didn't pick it up.

1241
02:33:36,649 --> 02:33:37,809
I went, oh, blah, blah, blah.

1242
02:33:37,809 --> 02:33:39,760
Nope.

1243
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:42,200
Oh, I hope it got picked up, it was weird.

1244
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:50,069
I was about to cough.

1245
02:33:50,069 --> 02:33:58,889
You stop getting CBD injections.

1246
02:33:58,889 --> 02:34:00,290
It was Jerma's tapeworm.

1247
02:34:01,479 --> 02:34:02,319
Oh.

1248
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:04,000
Jerma, is chat your little pogchamp?

1249
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:11,500
Yeah, I don't know, sure.

1250
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:15,190
Looks like you handled this one no problem.

1251
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:20,659
We better hope they're all like this.

1252
02:34:20,659 --> 02:34:25,750
All right, I'm injured, I need to drink.

1253
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:31,770
I need to drink.

1254
02:34:31,770 --> 02:34:35,700
Okay, I feel better.

1255
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:40,350
Four million, was that four million off the debt if I...

1256
02:34:40,350 --> 02:34:42,590
Four million off the debt to improv an apology video

1257
02:34:42,590 --> 02:34:45,870
for showing your genitals on stream.

1258
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:47,149
No, that's not enough.

1259
02:35:07,299 --> 02:35:09,620
Okay, let me do the story mission.

1260
02:35:09,620 --> 02:35:11,020
I've been playing for like three hours

1261
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:12,500
and I don't think I've done anything.

1262
02:35:22,819 --> 02:35:23,659
These people are chasing me.

1263
02:35:23,659 --> 02:35:24,579
I don't wanna fight them, I just wanna...

1264
02:35:24,579 --> 02:35:26,340
Wait, how much money do I have?

1265
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:29,229
Oh, shit, hold on.

1266
02:35:29,229 --> 02:35:34,819
I need to do this.

1267
02:35:34,819 --> 02:35:37,379
Not enough.

1268
02:35:37,379 --> 02:35:38,930
Wait, what about these?

1269
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:40,290
Two million, reduce the damage you take

1270
02:35:40,290 --> 02:35:42,690
when thrown by an enemy.

1271
02:35:42,690 --> 02:35:45,649
It's only two million.

1272
02:35:45,649 --> 02:35:51,250
Reduce the rate that the heat gauge drops down over time.

1273
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:54,680
What about beast?

1274
02:35:54,680 --> 02:35:56,399
Increase the power of your regular attacks

1275
02:35:56,399 --> 02:36:00,809
and heat actions in beast style.

1276
02:36:00,809 --> 02:36:05,090
It's a no-brainer.

1277
02:36:05,129 --> 02:36:06,540
Go to the shrine.

1278
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:08,500
Boost max health, yeah, of course.

1279
02:36:14,909 --> 02:36:16,190
What else we got?

1280
02:36:16,190 --> 02:36:17,950
Charge forward while keeping your guard up.

1281
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:19,190
You won't be staggered by attacks

1282
02:36:19,190 --> 02:36:20,469
below a certain power level.

1283
02:36:20,469 --> 02:36:21,950
Okay, what up here?

1284
02:36:29,510 --> 02:36:30,670
This is kinda good.

1285
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:39,850
What's after that?

1286
02:36:39,850 --> 02:36:40,690
This connects it.

1287
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:43,909
I wanna see what's over here.

1288
02:36:43,909 --> 02:36:47,180
Boost the power of your attacks when in heat mode.

1289
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:51,129
Yeah.

1290
02:36:51,129 --> 02:36:54,420
Did I just unlock this thing over here?

1291
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:56,540
You are less likely to falter during a rush combo

1292
02:36:56,540 --> 02:36:57,739
when in heat mode.

1293
02:36:57,739 --> 02:37:03,530
400 million dollars!

1294
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:04,889
We have a confirmed offer.

1295
02:37:05,850 --> 02:37:08,079
We have an offer here, hold on.

1296
02:37:08,079 --> 02:37:08,920
Confirmed offer, wait, wait, wait.

1297
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:12,299
What is it?

1298
02:37:12,299 --> 02:37:14,739
Do offer, read to us green eggs and ham

1299
02:37:14,739 --> 02:37:15,899
without fucking up once.

1300
02:37:15,899 --> 02:37:24,110
Remove 75 million.

1301
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:26,379
Without fucking up once?

1302
02:37:26,379 --> 02:37:31,739
Is that a deal?

1303
02:37:31,739 --> 02:37:35,020
Okay.

1304
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:36,139
I don't have green eggs and ham.

1305
02:37:36,139 --> 02:37:45,479
I don't own it.

1306
02:37:45,479 --> 02:37:46,319
Okay, I got it.

1307
02:37:46,319 --> 02:37:48,370
No, I got it, okay.

1308
02:37:48,370 --> 02:37:50,020
Green eggs and ham.

1309
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:51,139
I am Sam.

1310
02:37:51,139 --> 02:37:52,299
I am Sam.

1311
02:37:52,299 --> 02:37:53,819
Sam I am.

1312
02:37:53,819 --> 02:37:54,899
That's Sam I am.

1313
02:37:54,899 --> 02:37:56,020
That's Sam I am.

1314
02:37:56,020 --> 02:37:59,239
I do not like that Sam I am.

1315
02:37:59,239 --> 02:38:02,020
Do would you like green eggs and ham?

1316
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:04,420
I do not like them, Sam I am.

1317
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:07,309
I do not like green eggs and ham.

1318
02:38:07,309 --> 02:38:08,750
Would you like them here or there?

1319
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:12,659
Wait, show it?

1320
02:38:12,659 --> 02:38:15,700
Okay, here.

1321
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:16,780
All right, all right, all right, I'll do it.

1322
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:18,219
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1323
02:38:18,219 --> 02:38:31,510
Hold on, I was even in the middle of something.

1324
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:38,420
Okay, where is it?

1325
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:42,680
You can't see it.

1326
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:46,559
I love how there's an anti-aliasing here.

1327
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:55,739
Can you not see it?

1328
02:38:55,739 --> 02:38:58,280
Is it too much text here?

1329
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:01,120
I'll take a screenshot, hold on.

1330
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:08,620
I have it in a text file.

1331
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:09,579
You shouldn't be able to see it.

1332
02:39:09,579 --> 02:39:17,940
How come the, huh, that's weird.

1333
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:20,379
Read it faster.

1334
02:39:20,379 --> 02:39:22,579
Don't get relief, have it.

1335
02:39:22,579 --> 02:39:24,819
Wait, what?

1336
02:39:24,819 --> 02:39:25,819
How come I can't get this to show?

1337
02:39:25,819 --> 02:39:28,569
I'll just have to take a screenshot.

1338
02:39:28,569 --> 02:39:33,750
It's a long book, man.

1339
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:36,430
Okay, can you see if I do this?

1340
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:45,059
I'm just trying to put the text on the screen.

1341
02:39:45,059 --> 02:39:48,159
Okay, hold on.

1342
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:51,860
Is it showing up yet?

1343
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:56,000
Anybody see it?

1344
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,430
Not showing up at all.

1345
02:39:59,430 --> 02:40:04,940
You can't even see it at all.

1346
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:05,780
No, you can't see it.

1347
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:09,059
All right, so I'm using Streamlabs OBS for the last time.

1348
02:40:09,059 --> 02:40:10,340
It's literally the last day I'm gonna use it.

1349
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,219
I'm uninstalling this shit

1350
02:40:11,219 --> 02:40:18,649
as soon as I get off the fucking stream.

1351
02:40:18,649 --> 02:40:24,200
Okay, hold on.

1352
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:25,799
You said that last year.

1353
02:40:25,799 --> 02:40:26,639
I know.

1354
02:40:29,819 --> 02:40:30,659
I'm gonna put, hold on.

1355
02:40:30,659 --> 02:40:32,860
Let me just paste it and just, hold on, here.

1356
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:35,059
Just, we're gonna look at some art for a second.

1357
02:40:35,059 --> 02:40:35,899
I'll be right back.

1358
02:40:35,899 --> 02:40:37,100
And plus I should piss too.

1359
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:39,850
I'll get this ready.

1360
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:40,889
Let's take a look at some artwork.

1361
02:40:40,889 --> 02:40:41,729
I'm gonna go pee.

1362
02:40:41,729 --> 02:40:44,600
I'm gonna get this ready and I'll do it.

1363
02:40:44,600 --> 02:43:55,180
Be right back.

1364
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:59,200
Okay, I am back.

1365
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:01,639
Let's get some, I would say music,

1366
02:44:01,639 --> 02:44:10,549
but can I get royalty-free cartoon music?

1367
02:44:10,549 --> 02:44:13,030
Background cartoon music, royalty-free.

1368
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:20,340
No copyright cartoon music.

1369
02:44:20,379 --> 02:44:21,899
Let's see if this is good.

1370
02:44:21,899 --> 02:44:24,059
No copyright cartoon background music.

1558
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:10,450

Not in a box, not with a fox.

Would you, could you in a car?

1586
02:53:00,889 --> 02:53:02,729
Eat them, eat them, here they are.

1587
02:53:02,729 --> 02:53:04,770
I would not, could not in a car.

1588
02:53:04,770 --> 02:53:06,649
You may like them, you will see.

1589
02:53:06,649 --> 02:53:08,489
You may like them in a tree.

1590
02:53:08,489 --> 02:53:10,450
I would not, could not in a tree.

1591
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,690
Not in a car, you let me be.

A train, a train, a train, a train.

1601
02:53:29,549 --> 02:53:31,309
Could you, would you on a train?

1602
02:53:31,309 --> 02:53:37,430
Not on a train, fucking there's no A.

1603
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:43,200
This is, there's misspelling in this.

1604
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:45,639
There's misspellings from this.

1605
02:53:45,639 --> 02:53:48,760
It's not on a, it is not on a train.

1606
02:53:48,760 --> 02:53:51,079
Not in a car, Sam let me be.

1607
02:53:51,079 --> 02:53:53,000
I would not, could not in a box.

1608
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
I would not, could not with a fox.

1609
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:56,879
I will not eat them in a house.

I do not eat Green Eggs and Ham.

1614
02:54:08,659 --> 02:54:11,440
I do not like them, Sam I am.

1615
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:13,979
Say in the dark, this is unfair.

1616
02:54:13,979 --> 02:54:16,540
Here in the dark, would you, could you in the dark?

1617
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:18,360
I would not, could not in the dark.

1618
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:20,600
Would you, could you in the rain?

1619
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:22,559
I would not, could not in the rain.

1620
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:24,920
Not in the dark, not on a train.

1621
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:26,659
Not in a car, not in a tree.

1622
02:54:26,659 --> 02:54:29,000
I do not like them, Sam you see.

1623
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:30,840
Not in a house, not in a box.

1624
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:32,920
Not with a mouse, not with a fox.

1625
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:34,239
I will not eat them here or there.

1626
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:36,079
I do not like them, Sam, anywhere.

1627
02:54:36,079 --> 02:54:39,120
Oh wow, just a little bit of actor ad libbing.

1628
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:40,719
You do not like Green Eggs and Ham?

1629
02:54:40,719 --> 02:54:42,399
I do not like them, Sam I am.

1630
02:54:42,399 --> 02:54:43,780
Could you, would you with a goat?

1631
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:45,520
I would not, could not with a goat.

1632
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:46,719
Would you, could you on a boat?

1633
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:48,200
I could not, would not on a boat.

1634
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:49,879
I will not, will not with a goat.

1635
02:54:49,879 --> 02:54:51,479
I will not eat them in the rain.

1636
02:54:51,479 --> 02:54:53,739
I will not eat them in the dark, not in a tree.

1637
02:54:53,739 --> 02:54:54,879
Not in a car.

1638
02:54:54,879 --> 02:54:56,159
Would you let me be?

1639
02:54:56,159 --> 02:54:58,159
I do not like them in a box.

1640
02:54:58,159 --> 02:55:00,920
I do not like them with a fox.

1641
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:02,680
I will not eat them in a house.

1642
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:04,559
I do not like them with a mouse.

1643
02:55:04,559 --> 02:55:06,079
I do not like them here or there.

1644
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:08,120
I do not like them anywhere.

1645
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:10,440
I do not like Green Eggs and Ham.

1646
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:12,840
I don't like them, Sam I am.

1647
02:55:12,840 --> 02:55:14,399
You don't like them, so you say?

1648
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:16,559
Try them, try them and you may.

1649
02:55:16,559 --> 02:55:18,799
Try them and you may, I say.

1650
02:55:18,799 --> 02:55:21,360
Sam, if you let me be, I will try them.

1651
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:22,360
You will see.

1652
02:55:28,680 --> 02:55:32,000
I say, the Green Eggs and Ham.

1653
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,360
I do, I like them, Sam I am.

1654
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:37,020
And I would eat them in a boat.

1655
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:38,600
I would eat them with a goat.

1656
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:40,319
I would eat them in the barn.

1657
02:55:40,319 --> 02:55:42,639
I would eat them in the dark and on a train.

1658
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:43,920
And in a car and in a tree.

1659
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,520
They're so good, you see.

1660
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:46,979
They're so good.

1661
02:55:46,979 --> 02:55:48,079
So I will eat them in a box

1662
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:49,000
and I will eat them with a fox

1663
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:49,840
and I will eat them in a house

1664
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:50,680
and I will eat them with a mouse

1665
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:52,079
and I will eat them here and there.

1666
02:55:52,079 --> 02:55:53,100
I say I will eat them anywhere.

1667
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:54,760
So you like Green Eggs and Ham.

1668
02:55:54,760 --> 02:55:56,280
Thank you, thank you, Sam I am.

1669
02:55:56,280 --> 02:56:04,780
I'm gonna go back to play Yakuza now.

1670
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:06,520
There were misspellings in this

1671
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:07,879
and it fucked me up.

1672
02:56:07,879 --> 02:56:11,040
That's not fair.

1673
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:19,139
Is it corporate video background music?

1674
02:56:19,139 --> 02:56:23,479
Okay everybody, get set, get ready.

1675
02:56:23,479 --> 02:56:27,680
Here comes our five annual company meeting.

1676
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:30,159
We all got matching t-shirts.

1677
02:56:30,159 --> 02:56:32,120
The CEO is here.

1678
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:34,000
He's gonna get on stage.

1679
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:37,040
He's gonna have quick and bright white fucking teeth.

1680
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:38,620
He just got him cleaned.

1681
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:42,440
And he just got him polished for this event.

1682
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:44,200
He can't wait to make you feel

1683
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:46,639
like you're one of the company members.

1684
02:56:46,639 --> 02:56:48,520
Oh here he is.

1685
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:50,799
Dan Stevenson.

1686
02:56:50,799 --> 02:56:54,440
A guy that makes 2.7 million dollars a year.

1687
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:56,200
He loves the fact that you're here.

1688
02:56:57,159 --> 02:56:59,040
And by the way, we haven't increased our wages

1689
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:02,360
for this company in probably six years.

1690
02:57:02,459 --> 02:57:04,040
Come on in, put your t-shirts on

1691
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:07,719
and get excited for Dan Stevenson.

1692
02:57:07,719 --> 02:57:08,719
Get him on stage.

1693
02:57:10,209 --> 02:57:12,649
Yeah, ooh, here he comes.

1694
02:57:12,649 --> 02:57:14,370
Yeah, woo hoo, yeah.

1695
02:57:16,370 --> 02:57:22,250
Everybody, welcome to the self, self-fear realty group.

1696
02:57:25,809 --> 02:57:32,110
I love all of you so much.

1697
02:57:32,110 --> 02:57:37,069
Thank you, and thank you, and thank you, and thank you.

1698
02:57:37,229 --> 02:57:40,260
Self-fear realty group.

1699
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:41,500
What is happening, I don't know.

1700
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:47,370
I kinda lost track, I kinda lost control.

1701
02:57:47,370 --> 02:57:50,420
All right, whatever, I lost.

1702
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:54,819
Whoa, whoa, who is this?

1703
02:57:54,819 --> 02:57:57,299
And who is this, look at that open mouth.

1704
02:57:57,299 --> 02:58:01,399
Look like a fucking idiot.

1705
02:58:01,399 --> 02:58:03,920
It was making me laugh because I was doing the John Oliver,

1706
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:06,399
I kept seeing John Oliver in chat.

1707
02:58:06,399 --> 02:58:07,840
I do not like them at the most.

1708
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:09,440
I do not like them here or there.

1709
02:58:09,440 --> 02:58:11,299
I was gonna start laughing.

1710
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:35,440
Ugh, whatever else can play Yakuza, fuck it.

1711
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:38,469
Did you fix your Joker impression yet?

1712
02:58:38,469 --> 02:58:40,709
Joker, what do you mean fix my Joker impression?

1713
02:58:40,709 --> 02:58:41,549
It's perfect.

1714
02:58:46,780 --> 02:58:50,059
I definitely, I feel like he would do that too.

1715
02:58:50,059 --> 02:58:51,379
Don't you feel like that in like an episode

1716
02:58:51,379 --> 02:58:54,340
of the John Oliver show, for Christmas this year,

1717
02:58:54,340 --> 02:59:06,319
he's going to read the entire greetings that I have.

1718
02:59:06,319 --> 02:59:08,440
Read more Dr. Seuss books, no.

1719
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:17,510
All right, can I get five million off the debt for that?

1720
02:59:17,510 --> 02:59:18,350
If you're good at something,

1721
02:59:18,350 --> 02:59:22,079
never do it for free, Samayam.

1722
02:59:22,079 --> 02:59:24,000
By the way, why does Samayam give two shits

1723
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,399
about what I like to eat for food?

1724
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:35,420
You want to think about that?

1725
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:37,139
No, you have to eat this, eat it.

1726
02:59:37,139 --> 02:59:39,780
I don't want it, I don't really like seafood.

1727
02:59:39,780 --> 02:59:42,180
No, no, no, dude, just trust me, trust me.

1728
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:43,420
Just eat it, you'll love it.

1729
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:47,239
I don't want it, I don't want to do that.

1730
02:59:47,239 --> 02:59:50,680
Stop telling me to eat foods you like.

1731
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:53,079
You're missing the point, I know, try new things.

1732
03:00:01,799 --> 03:00:02,639
What are you doing?

1733
03:00:02,639 --> 03:00:06,920
You're gonna look, you're gonna link, link, link, link,

1734
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:10,139
link, link, link, link, link.

1735
03:00:10,139 --> 03:00:12,409
What is the link?

1736
03:00:12,409 --> 03:00:14,370
I do not like that man, Ted Cruz.

1737
03:00:15,329 --> 03:00:17,729
I do not like his far right views.

1738
03:00:17,729 --> 03:00:19,409
I do not like his stupid chin.

1739
03:00:19,409 --> 03:00:21,569
I do not like his smarmy grin.

1740
03:00:21,569 --> 03:00:23,209
I do not like him with a beard.

1741
03:00:23,209 --> 03:00:25,229
I do not like him freshly sheared.

1742
03:00:26,610 --> 03:00:28,370
I do not like Ted Cruz at all.

1743
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:30,690
That man, Ted Cruz, can suck my balls.

1744
03:00:32,559 --> 03:00:33,760
I don't like that man.

1745
03:00:33,799 --> 03:00:40,239
I do not like Ted Cruz, I don't.

1746
03:00:40,239 --> 03:00:41,079
What does he want?

1747
03:00:41,079 --> 03:00:42,959
Oh, here, take a tissue.

1748
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:50,620
I can't believe it, you already did it, whatever.

1749
03:00:56,440 --> 03:00:57,959
Ooh, we're friends.

1750
03:01:13,479 --> 03:01:14,600
All right, can I please,

1751
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:18,120
I just want to do a story mission for once.

1752
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:28,399
Well, here's the champion district.

1753
03:01:28,399 --> 03:01:33,500
Excuse me, do you guys know what the champion is?

1754
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:35,100
He doesn't deserve money off, what's this poll?

1755
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:36,299
We got a poll, hold on.

1756
03:01:36,459 --> 03:01:41,459
Chat thinks you deserve 250 million off the debt for that.

1757
03:01:41,739 --> 03:01:45,059
Wait a minute, does German deserve 250 million off?

1758
03:01:45,059 --> 03:01:53,100
Oh shit, oh man, this is a vote going on right now.

1759
03:01:53,420 --> 03:02:01,579
Holy shit, this is 250 mil, that's coming off.

1760
03:02:01,579 --> 03:02:10,319
It's 71% saying yes.

1761
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:13,159
The original offer was 75 for no mistakes.

1762
03:02:13,159 --> 03:02:16,659
Hey, I'm not keeping the books here,

1763
03:02:16,659 --> 03:02:21,819
I'm just the one that has to pay.

1764
03:02:22,459 --> 03:02:25,239
All right, that's pretty unanimous.

1765
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:36,170
Fraud, fraud, rigged, stop, stop the count.

1766
03:02:40,549 --> 03:02:47,370
I do not like them.

1767
03:02:47,370 --> 03:02:49,889
All right, I'm gonna leave it up to you guys,

1768
03:02:49,889 --> 03:02:59,239
but that's pretty clear that it's 250 million.

1769
03:02:59,239 --> 03:03:11,950
Mash his head down, I want money.

1770
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:21,149
Oh, links, oh, links.

1771
03:03:21,149 --> 03:03:24,489
Uh-oh, this, I mean, all right, no more links after this.

1772
03:03:24,489 --> 03:03:25,590
I'm done clicking links after this,

1773
03:03:26,350 --> 03:03:28,809
I wanna play Yakuza.

1774
03:03:28,809 --> 03:03:31,170
No mistakes, farting and screaming, one billion off.

1775
03:03:31,170 --> 03:03:33,690
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

1776
03:03:33,690 --> 03:03:35,409
No mistakes, farting and screaming

1777
03:03:35,409 --> 03:03:41,280
by reading one fish, two fish.

1778
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:51,209
Oh my god, that's gonna be impossible.

1779
03:03:51,209 --> 03:03:57,059
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that.

1780
03:03:57,059 --> 03:03:58,299
I don't think I can do it.

1781
03:04:06,930 --> 03:04:12,510
Okay, I'm gonna go for it.

1782
03:04:12,510 --> 03:04:15,069
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

1783
03:04:15,069 --> 03:04:18,030
Black fish, blue fish, old fish, new fish.

1784
03:04:18,030 --> 03:04:20,149
This one has a little car.

1785
03:04:20,190 --> 03:04:22,430
This one has a little star.

1786
03:04:22,430 --> 03:04:25,430
Say, what a lot of fish there are.

1787
03:04:25,430 --> 03:04:28,510
Yes, some are red, some are blue.

1788
03:04:28,510 --> 03:04:30,510
Some are old and some are new.

1789
03:04:30,510 --> 03:04:35,780
Some are sad and I can't, oh, I can't, I can't.

1790
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,940
I don't care, I'm done.

1791
03:04:42,510 --> 03:04:48,020
I can't do that.

1792
03:04:48,020 --> 03:04:50,600
Once the lady screamed, it's like, I can't.

1793
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:02,700
You lost, friend.

1794
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:03,540
Why are you here?

1795
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:05,360
There's no place in this name.

1796
03:05:05,479 --> 03:05:07,040
I serve a yakuza like you.

1797
03:05:11,719 --> 03:05:15,079
Two billion with a face cam, I can't do that.

1798
03:05:15,079 --> 03:05:17,479
I know, I gotta do things I know I can do.

1799
03:05:17,479 --> 03:05:19,559
No, I can't do it, I can't.

1800
03:05:23,559 --> 03:05:24,399
I can't.

1801
03:05:25,879 --> 03:05:29,399
That's a long book, that's like a 10 minute read.

1802
03:05:29,399 --> 03:05:31,000
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

1803
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:34,600
No, I plan on doing soon anyways.

1804
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:37,000
I wanna do like a laugh you lose thing on Twitch.

1805
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,639
People do it and it's like just fun.

1806
03:05:39,639 --> 03:05:42,319
I wanna do it, I've done it like weirdly before.

1807
03:05:42,319 --> 03:05:44,920
No emotion, right, don't laugh for like subs and stuff.

1808
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:47,000
I wanna do that like for real for the whole stream.

1809
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:51,399
We'll set that up for like in like a week or two or something.

1810
03:05:51,399 --> 03:05:52,239
That would be fun.

1811
03:06:06,979 --> 03:06:08,780
Sound better today?

1812
03:06:08,780 --> 03:06:11,860
I might sound better, but I'm still coughing.

1813
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:14,860
And you just like brought it up to the house like, hey.

1814
03:06:18,450 --> 03:06:20,329
I have a dry cough today, being annoying.

1815
03:06:20,329 --> 03:06:23,129
I think it's because my nasal turp is being annoying.

1816
03:06:23,129 --> 03:06:24,969
I'm definitely getting over it though.

1817
03:06:24,969 --> 03:06:30,010
Maybe like another day or two.

1818
03:06:30,010 --> 03:06:33,379
Baseball bat, I wanna end it with a, come on.

1819
03:06:33,379 --> 03:06:36,540
Holy shit, oh my God, am I gonna like execute this guy?

1820
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,620
Holy shit.

1821
03:06:48,600 --> 03:06:49,440
Did I get my results?

1822
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:51,159
Yeah, I am negative for COVID-19.

1823
03:06:51,159 --> 03:06:52,000
So that's good.

1824
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:54,959
It's probably just like a cold.

1825
03:07:17,420 --> 03:07:19,260
Is there gonna be stakes for a laugh you lose?

1826
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:21,659
Oh, of course there are always stakes here.

1827
03:07:21,659 --> 03:07:23,219
Always high stakes here.

1828
03:07:23,500 --> 03:07:24,340
Yeah.

1829
03:07:40,520 --> 03:07:41,719
Yeah, we'll do webcam.

1830
03:07:41,719 --> 03:07:43,079
I'll make sure the cam's on.

1831
03:07:45,079 --> 03:07:46,079
It's this guy again.

1832
03:07:54,639 --> 03:07:56,280
You guys have to be able to verify it or not.

1833
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:58,639
I can't just like sit here with the mic muted.

1834
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,719
I don't know.

1835
03:08:37,049 --> 03:08:38,450
Can you please stop this yakuza bit

1836
03:08:38,450 --> 03:08:40,450
and go back to the Dr. Seuss stream?

1837
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:43,120
No, not today.

1838
03:08:56,319 --> 03:08:57,159
What did he say?

1839
03:09:00,079 --> 03:09:01,159
Come to the place.

1840
03:09:21,959 --> 03:09:22,959
I'm just reading chat right now.

1841
03:09:22,959 --> 03:09:24,329
I gotta pay attention to the game.

1842
03:09:48,690 --> 03:09:50,690
Why did it change from the attitude of the other players

1843
03:09:51,690 --> 03:09:54,090
Why did it change from the attitude of the other place?

1844
03:10:16,760 --> 03:10:21,370
Just play the OG Diablo already, man.

1845
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:22,209
I know you want to.

1846
03:10:23,729 --> 03:10:26,440
I'm not trying to be arrogant.

1847
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:29,819
But, you know, you're a Diablo.

1848
03:10:29,819 --> 03:10:31,059
You're the one who rules.

1849
03:10:31,059 --> 03:10:33,260
I play Diablo too with somebody, and just like chill.

1850
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:41,950

I'm a

1856
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:48,780
I'm a

1857
03:10:48,780 --> 03:10:50,719
I'm a

1858
03:10:50,719 --> 03:10:51,719
I'm a

03:10:51,719 --> 03:10:52,719
I'm a

1860
03:10:52,719 --> 03:10:54,600
I'm a

03:10:59,170 --> 03:11:01,170
D2 and chill.

1865
03:11:01,170 --> 03:11:02,170
Stop it.

1866
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:04,170
I'm trying to read the video.

1867
03:11:04,170 --> 03:11:05,170
All right.

1868
03:11:05,170 --> 03:11:06,170
I didn't even to read it.

1869
03:11:06,170 --> 03:11:07,540
What?

1870
03:11:07,540 --> 03:11:09,549
Did we get a TLDR tweet?

1871
03:11:09,549 --> 03:11:10,549
Come on.

1872
03:11:10,549 --> 03:11:11,549
No TLDR lore tweet.

1873
03:11:11,549 --> 03:11:12,719
Hmm.

1874
03:11:12,719 --> 03:11:13,719
Not good.

1875
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:18,239
Are you bored?

1876
03:11:18,239 --> 03:11:19,239
No, of course not.

1877
03:11:19,239 --> 03:11:23,879
Save it though.

1878
03:11:23,879 --> 03:11:30,559
I'm not bored.

1879
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:31,559
Hey, chef.

1880
03:11:31,559 --> 03:11:34,559
Thanks for the five community subs, chef piece.

1881
03:11:34,559 --> 03:11:35,559
Thank you.

1882
03:11:35,559 --> 03:11:39,370
How many times have I saved the game?

1883
03:11:39,370 --> 03:11:50,700
Trying just to fast track the story.

1884
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:58,899
Almost several P would like to have a world with you in the discord.

1885
03:11:58,899 --> 03:12:02,979
But somebody wants to have a word with me in the discord, so I have to just like go

1886
03:12:02,979 --> 03:12:06,920
in there and just listen to them.

1887
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:08,290
What?

1888
03:12:08,290 --> 03:12:11,590
Several people want to have a word with me in the discord.

1889
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:15,979
I wonder how loud the screams are going to be when I go into voice one.

1890
03:12:15,979 --> 03:12:19,739
I wonder how loud it's going to be when I hurt myself.

1891
03:12:19,739 --> 03:12:27,959
My ears going into voice one in the discord.

1892
03:12:27,959 --> 03:12:31,079
That Oda guy said if I wait in the penthouse here, he'll show up.

1893
03:12:31,079 --> 03:12:33,600
Let's go.

1894
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:46,459
You just ruined the discord.

1895
03:12:46,459 --> 03:12:48,280
Well, sorry.

1896
03:12:48,280 --> 03:12:52,139
I ain't going in there.

1897
03:12:52,139 --> 03:12:55,809
The fight.

1898
03:12:55,809 --> 03:12:58,809
If it's a fight you're looking for, it's a fight you'll get.

1899
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:15,680
The next chapter is on Jima.

1900
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:17,680
Is that a different city or something?

1901
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:19,680
With new minigames?

1902
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:21,680
I'm just trying to get through the story to play more minigames.

1903
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:23,680
That's all I care about.

1904
03:13:30,719 --> 03:13:38,600
A young thug would come barging in and I would greet him with gentle bruising.

1905
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:41,989
Oda?

1906
03:13:41,989 --> 03:13:46,850
Oh, it was that jerk with the germa hair.

1907
03:14:04,819 --> 03:14:05,819
Shit, I'm sorry.

1908
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:06,819
I'm like doing this a lot off.

1909
03:14:06,819 --> 03:14:07,819
I'm trying to mute.

1910
03:14:17,379 --> 03:14:21,350
It's like 500 people in voice one.

1911
03:14:21,350 --> 03:14:22,350
What are you just trying to do?

1912
03:14:22,350 --> 03:14:23,350
Break the server?

1913
03:14:23,350 --> 03:14:25,350
Don't do that.

1914
03:14:29,719 --> 03:14:33,719
I'm sure you're all singing your own songs that you have on Spotify.

1915
03:14:33,719 --> 03:14:36,719
Oh, by the way, somebody said, hey, dude, do the Spotify thing where you like say what

1916
03:14:36,719 --> 03:14:38,719
you've been listening to on Spotify.

1917
03:14:38,719 --> 03:14:41,719
I don't even have Spotify installed on any device.

1918
03:14:41,719 --> 03:14:43,719
I've never listened to Spotify for one day.

1919
03:14:50,760 --> 03:14:56,290
Oh, bonus.

1920
03:14:56,290 --> 03:14:57,290
Lightly fast.

1921
03:14:57,290 --> 03:15:00,620
No, no, no, no, no, don't do that.

1922
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:01,620
I want to hit somebody with it.

1923
03:15:01,620 --> 03:15:02,620
Oh, right in the table.

1924
03:15:02,620 --> 03:15:03,620
Into the table.

1925
03:15:03,620 --> 03:15:04,620
Into the table.

1926
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,620
Come on, get over here.

1927
03:15:05,620 --> 03:15:06,620
Table, table, table, table.

1928
03:15:06,620 --> 03:15:07,620
Come on, WWF.

1929
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:10,200
No.

1930
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:12,200
I want to WWF into the table.

1931
03:15:12,200 --> 03:15:15,200
Holy shit, I'm going to sofa somebody in the head.

1932
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:19,200
Nice.

1933
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:21,200
Can I pick up the whole sofa with beast mode?

1934
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:23,200
What the fuck?

1935
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:24,200
What is this?

1936
03:15:24,200 --> 03:15:25,200
What?

1937
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:28,889
Holy shit, I have a sword.

1938
03:15:28,889 --> 03:15:40,389
You absolutely can pick up the sofa.

1939
03:15:40,389 --> 03:15:48,069
I can pick up the sofa, can I?

1940
03:15:48,069 --> 03:15:52,610
I don't think I can.

1941
03:15:52,610 --> 03:16:01,790
Come here.

1942
03:16:01,790 --> 03:16:08,569
It was the table.

1943
03:16:08,569 --> 03:16:10,450
Pepe D.

1944
03:16:10,450 --> 03:16:12,450
What's Pepe D?

1945
03:16:12,450 --> 03:16:15,700
I can't see it.

1946
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:17,700
Discord is omega fucked and it's your fault.

1947
03:16:17,700 --> 03:16:28,790
I apologize to all the Discord mods that are on Discord right now.

1948
03:16:28,790 --> 03:16:29,790
Scrambling.

1949
03:16:29,790 --> 03:16:31,790
I'm sorry.

1950
03:16:31,790 --> 03:16:37,000
I'm just sitting over here Pepe D-ing.

1951
03:16:57,479 --> 03:16:59,479
There you're pretty good in a fight.

1952
03:16:59,479 --> 03:17:02,479
But good enough to merit President Tachibana personally recruiting you?

1953
03:17:02,479 --> 03:17:04,479
I just don't know.

1954
03:17:04,479 --> 03:17:07,479
You'll have to fight me and throw me through this window.

1955
03:17:07,479 --> 03:17:10,479
Guaranteed and I'll fall onto the street and die.

1956
03:17:20,780 --> 03:17:22,780
What weapon is that?

1957
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:32,479
He's holding that backwards.

1958
03:17:34,360 --> 03:17:36,360
Hold it like with the hammer pointing out.

1959
03:17:36,360 --> 03:17:38,360
Use the hammer side.

1960
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:49,430
It's a good match.

1961
03:17:49,430 --> 03:17:51,430
We don't need to fight each other.

1962
03:17:51,430 --> 03:17:55,500
Come at me with that intention!

1963
03:18:41,159 --> 03:18:45,000
Take this.

1964
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
Now use the sword.

1965
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:54,209
Let's go!

1966
03:18:54,209 --> 03:18:55,209
Sunburst.

1967
03:18:55,209 --> 03:19:03,579
This thing is insane.

1968
03:19:03,579 --> 03:19:05,579
Now we're going to go beast mode.

1969
03:19:05,579 --> 03:19:11,020
Table smash.

1970
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:13,020
He's got burst.

1971
03:19:13,020 --> 03:19:18,719
Stay away.

1972
03:19:18,719 --> 03:19:20,719
Let me dodge.

1973
03:19:32,750 --> 03:19:35,690
Let's go through the window.

1974
03:19:36,690 --> 03:19:41,809
I'm going to throw him in the window?

1975
03:19:41,809 --> 03:19:42,809
Heal.

1976
03:19:42,809 --> 03:19:43,809
Fuck.

1977
03:19:43,809 --> 03:19:52,920
Heal.

1978
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:55,000
Fuck.

1979
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:58,600
Wait.

1980
03:19:58,600 --> 03:20:01,569
I got heat.

1981
03:20:01,569 --> 03:20:04,920
I'm ready.

1982
03:20:04,920 --> 03:20:06,920
I want to throw him out the fucking window.

1983
03:20:06,920 --> 03:20:08,920
Go out the fucking window!

1984
03:20:13,709 --> 03:20:16,459
Do a heat move with the sword.

1985
03:20:16,459 --> 03:20:33,569
Got it.

1986
03:20:33,569 --> 03:20:36,579
God damn it.

1987
03:20:36,579 --> 03:20:37,579
I don't give a shit.

1988
03:20:37,579 --> 03:20:39,840
Whatever.

1989
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:53,479
I'm just going to do all the drugs.

1990
03:20:53,479 --> 03:20:54,780
I got heat.

1991
03:20:54,780 --> 03:20:55,780
I don't even care.

1992
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:58,790
I just want to play the casino game.

1993
03:20:58,790 --> 03:20:59,790
I don't care.

1994
03:20:59,790 --> 03:21:00,790
Just kill him.

1995
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:05,870
Slash him once.

1996
03:21:05,870 --> 03:21:06,870
I don't care.

1997
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:08,870
All this is just to get to the casino and go to the slot machine.

1998
03:21:08,870 --> 03:21:10,870
I don't give a shit about anything else that's going on.

1999
03:21:20,750 --> 03:21:23,690
There are no slot machines.

2000
03:21:23,690 --> 03:21:25,690
Why did I spend all this time playing this?

2001
03:21:39,399 --> 03:21:45,600
This dude's kind of cringe.

2002
03:21:51,809 --> 03:21:52,809
Hey, boss.

2003
03:21:52,809 --> 03:21:55,879
What's going on?

2004
03:21:55,879 --> 03:22:00,319
You tried to test me on Oda, didn't you?

2005
03:22:00,319 --> 03:22:02,319
Sword's really good, though.

2006
03:22:02,319 --> 03:22:03,319
It does a lot of damage.

2007
03:22:03,319 --> 03:22:05,129
Yeah.

2008
03:22:05,129 --> 03:22:08,129
Oda-san is an irreplaceable one-armed man to me.

2009
03:22:08,129 --> 03:22:14,680
That's why we needed to take his understanding in order to welcome you into our lives.

2010
03:22:18,450 --> 03:22:20,450
That's right.

2011
03:22:20,450 --> 03:22:23,450
I've been thinking of myself as a fool.

2012
03:22:23,450 --> 03:22:28,950
I thought you guys could have trusted me until now.

2013
03:22:38,319 --> 03:22:39,319
Tachibana.

2014
03:22:39,319 --> 03:22:40,319
It's about time.

2015
03:22:40,319 --> 03:22:43,319
Show me what you've been up to all this time.

2016
03:22:45,319 --> 03:22:48,319
Why did you come all the way here?

2017
03:22:48,319 --> 03:22:50,319
What's the reason for that?

2018
03:22:53,129 --> 03:22:54,129
Isn't that nice?

2019
03:22:55,129 --> 03:22:57,129
But before that,

2020
03:22:58,129 --> 03:23:01,129
What do you think of this town called Kamurocho?

2021
03:23:01,129 --> 03:23:03,879
Kamurocho?

2022
03:23:04,879 --> 03:23:05,879
I don't know.

2023
03:23:05,879 --> 03:23:06,879
I don't even care.

2024
03:23:06,879 --> 03:23:08,879
I don't know what you're talking about.

2025
03:23:10,639 --> 03:23:12,639
I'm Kiryu-san.

2026
03:23:12,639 --> 03:23:18,200
This town is said to be the feeding ground of the Tojo Clan.

2027
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:24,590
People and money gathered in this town, colored by neon, all night long.

2028
03:23:24,590 --> 03:23:31,520
The sweet juice from there can be sucked up by the Tojo Clan.

2029
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:35,040
What are you talking about?

2030
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:39,850
This town is said to be the shining light of the Tojo Clan.

2031
03:23:39,850 --> 03:23:44,719
I am the one who opens the casernas.

2032
03:23:44,719 --> 03:23:46,600
Just like this.

2033
03:23:46,600 --> 03:23:49,860
Play Ellen Degeneres' slots.

2034
03:23:49,860 --> 03:23:53,860
I won like $200 on an Ellen Degeneres slot one time.

2035
03:23:53,860 --> 03:23:57,440
I think it was like $300 actually.

2036
03:23:57,440 --> 03:24:08,069
What the hell is he doing?

2037
03:24:10,329 --> 03:24:11,329
What?

2038
03:24:11,329 --> 03:24:15,680
Why does the guy have magneto powers?

2039
03:24:15,680 --> 03:24:20,360
Money is power.

2040
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:29,829
I want to see how far my power can reach the Tojo Clan.

2041
03:24:29,829 --> 03:24:35,610
But I still have a long way to go.

2042
03:24:36,610 --> 03:24:40,000
Oh, it's scripted.

2043
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:41,000
Let's see.

2044
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:45,000
He told all the people to turn the lights off for five seconds just to give me a point.

2045
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
To give me a point.

2046
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:32,409
I must play pocket racing.

2047
03:25:32,409 --> 03:25:36,409
Once I get to the new city, I'm just going to play the minigames and then turn the stream off.

2048
03:25:36,409 --> 03:25:39,409
I'm going to play the minigames for like two hours.

2049
03:25:55,079 --> 03:25:56,079
What?

2050
03:25:56,079 --> 03:25:57,079
That's my friend.

2051
03:25:57,079 --> 03:25:59,079
That's the guy that I know.

2052
03:25:59,079 --> 03:26:01,709
That's the person that's my friend.

2053
03:26:28,329 --> 03:26:29,329
The secret.

2054
03:26:29,329 --> 03:26:30,329
I'm the secret.

2055
03:26:40,100 --> 03:26:44,100
I feel like I'm jumping in halfway through a movie that I have not seen any of.

2056
03:26:44,100 --> 03:26:46,100
And I've been here the whole time.

2057
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:49,850
Hey, what are you watching, man?

2058
03:26:49,850 --> 03:26:52,850
Oh, this is the cool movie called Yakuza Zero.

2059
03:26:52,850 --> 03:26:54,850
Oh, let's sit down and just watch it.

2060
03:26:54,850 --> 03:26:55,850
Whatever.

2061
03:26:55,850 --> 03:26:56,850
Who's this guy?

2062
03:26:56,850 --> 03:26:57,850
Who's that guy?

2063
03:26:58,850 --> 03:27:00,850
What city are they in?

2064
03:27:00,850 --> 03:27:01,850
I don't know, man.

2065
03:27:01,850 --> 03:27:02,850
You got to just jump in.

2066
03:27:02,850 --> 03:27:07,290
Just chill.

2067
03:27:15,350 --> 03:27:17,350
Are you playing a game you don't care about?

2068
03:27:17,350 --> 03:27:20,350
I care very much about this game and all the fun stuff to do in it.

2069
03:27:20,350 --> 03:27:21,350

仮面ヤ it's the staff members

03:51:33,899 --> 03:51:36,459
上手くいってないみたいで

2284
03:51:44,020 --> 03:51:45,020
私からも話してみたのですが

2285
03:51:45,020 --> 03:51:50,020
別 sonic

2286
03:51:52,020 --> 03:51:54,020
次の役物ゲーム

2287
03:51:54,020 --> 03:52:05,340
May as well go see her now and get this over with. She's probably in the dressing room.

2288
03:52:05,340 --> 03:52:12,139
Alright, cool. And there's like an S here? Save point.

2289
03:52:12,139 --> 03:52:27,049
Oh, nice. How much money do I have in my bank account on this guy?

2290
03:52:27,049 --> 03:52:39,209
30,000 yen? What? I managed like a big hotel casino entertainment venue. I only got 30,000 yen in my pocket?

2291
03:52:39,209 --> 03:52:41,209
Should be four zeros added to that.

2292
03:52:41,209 --> 03:52:50,409
Alright, dressing room. Where's the dressing room?

2293
03:52:50,409 --> 03:52:54,000
Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk to these guys.

2294
03:52:55,000 --> 03:52:57,000
Let's see how they're doing.

2295
03:52:58,430 --> 03:53:02,829
Can I talk?

2296
03:53:03,829 --> 03:53:08,829
What an incredible spot. I had no idea Sotenbori was hiding such a gem.

2297
03:53:09,829 --> 03:53:12,829
I've been making this my regular spot whenever I'm in town.

2298
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:18,260
I mean, I'm just like, look. Oh, he's paying attention now. He like wants to talk to everybody.

2299
03:53:18,260 --> 03:53:22,260
He's in like the casino. He's in like the fucking hotel. Like, let's go. Welcome to Vegas.

2300
03:53:23,260 --> 03:53:25,260
Whatever. Alright. It's interesting to me. I like it.

2301
03:53:32,639 --> 03:53:34,639
Where are the dressing rooms though? Just walk around?

2302
03:53:34,639 --> 03:53:46,530
I'm gonna go down.

2303
03:53:46,530 --> 03:53:53,440
Got a minute.

2304
03:53:54,440 --> 03:53:56,440
Oh, sorry about that. What can I do for you?

2305
03:53:57,440 --> 03:54:00,440
Can you call Kane for me? I need to talk to her.

2306
03:54:00,440 --> 03:54:02,809
Yes, sir. Of course.

2307
03:54:02,809 --> 03:54:09,530
This deal is spacing out on the clock.

2308
03:54:09,530 --> 03:54:18,299
Hi, sir. Nice work out there tonight.

2309
03:54:19,299 --> 03:54:21,299
Thanks, Kane-chan.

2310
03:54:21,299 --> 03:54:23,600
So, you wanted to talk to me?

2311
03:54:23,600 --> 03:54:27,229
She said she was locking horns with Sakurako.

2312
03:54:28,229 --> 03:54:30,709
Hmm. Where do I start?

2313
03:54:30,709 --> 03:54:32,709
Hmm. Alright. Do we lay down the law?

2314
03:54:32,709 --> 03:54:34,709
I think not. I think we'd be like, hey.

2315
03:54:34,709 --> 03:54:40,790
Let's talk for a minute here.

2316
03:54:40,790 --> 03:54:42,790
Yeah, you're really smoking tonight, babe.

2317
03:54:42,790 --> 03:54:45,790
I thought some new idol singer wandered in.

2318
03:54:46,790 --> 03:54:51,030
Oh, you. That kind of flattery won't get anybody but paying customers anywhere, sir.

2319
03:54:51,030 --> 03:54:53,030
What? Is that wrong?

2320
03:54:54,200 --> 03:54:56,200
That right? I take it back then.

2321
03:54:56,200 --> 03:54:58,200
What? So it was just flattery, huh?

2322
03:54:58,200 --> 03:55:00,200
You wound me, boss.

2323
03:55:00,200 --> 03:55:03,200
Aw, come on. You know I can't tell a lie.

2324
03:55:03,200 --> 03:55:05,200
Here, I'll buy you dinner sometime soon. You forgive me?

2325
03:55:06,200 --> 03:55:08,200
Really? Oh, I'd love you, sir.

2326
03:55:09,200 --> 03:55:11,200
This is idiotic. Time to get to the point.

2327
03:55:12,200 --> 03:55:14,200
It's been about a month since you came on here.

2328
03:55:14,200 --> 03:55:18,200
Yeah? How's it going? Think you can make a real go of it at the Grand?

2329
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:25,979
Oh, I think so. The hall is much bigger than the last club I worked at, so it was pretty daunting at first, but I'm totally used to it now.

2330
03:55:25,979 --> 03:55:34,610
And more and more and more customers are coming here specifically to see me.

2331
03:55:34,610 --> 03:55:36,850
Yeah? That's great to hear.

2332
03:55:36,850 --> 03:55:41,850
Not surprising from the number one gal from one of the oldest cabarets in the Kita area.

2333
03:55:41,850 --> 03:55:43,850
I guess I was imagining things then.

2334
03:55:43,850 --> 03:55:46,600
Hmm? What do you mean?

2335
03:55:46,600 --> 03:55:51,600
Oh, see, the one month mark's actually when I see that most girls up and leave.

2336
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:54,780
I was a little worried you might be getting the itch too.

2337
03:55:54,780 --> 03:55:58,719
Oh, have no fear of that. I wouldn't dream of quitting now.

2338
03:55:59,719 --> 03:56:06,159
That hag Sakurako's been trying to play the seniority card on me, but I don't even notice her.

2339
03:56:06,159 --> 03:56:10,590
Damn, girl. Hag? This is pretty serious.

2340
03:56:10,590 --> 03:56:19,639
Aw, don't be like that. Sakurako's a vet here. She looks after the other girls too. Most love that about her.

2341
03:56:19,639 --> 03:56:21,819
Try to get along, yeah?

2342
03:56:21,819 --> 03:56:27,120
Oh, I hate nosy types like that. And she's got a whole entourage.

2343
03:56:27,120 --> 03:56:30,299
Whatever, soon I'll have my own clique and I won't have to deal with them.

2344
03:56:30,299 --> 03:56:33,989
Does she even realize she's getting lectured here?

2345
03:56:33,989 --> 03:56:35,989
Dan says adored this one.

2346
03:56:35,989 --> 03:56:37,989
She's even giving me a little too.

2347
03:56:37,989 --> 03:56:42,760
All right, we're gonna go more direct.

2348
03:56:42,760 --> 03:56:49,120
Direct. Better make it loud and clear for her.

2349
03:56:49,120 --> 03:56:50,809
That ain't right.

2350
03:56:50,809 --> 03:56:51,809
What kind of a champ?

2351
03:56:51,809 --> 03:56:53,809
You gotta learn to read the room.

2352
03:56:53,809 --> 03:56:55,309
Huh?

2353
03:56:55,309 --> 03:56:59,319
Doesn't matter how good you are at your job or how popular you get.

2354
03:56:59,319 --> 03:57:04,319
You've snubbed your seniors like that and you'll wake up one day with nothing but enemies here.

2355
03:57:04,319 --> 03:57:09,200
Fine by me, not like I do the job to make friends with the other girls.

2356
03:57:09,200 --> 03:57:20,799
Really? That the best you can do? I'm disappointed. I doubt you'll be around here long enough to make those enemies, then.

2357
03:57:20,799 --> 03:57:25,360
Wait, what's that supposed to mean? Is there a problem with my work?

2358
03:57:25,360 --> 03:57:32,479
Nailed it. She's the competitive type. With her pride on the hook, she'll take the bait.

2359
03:57:32,479 --> 03:57:39,110
Look, I ain't asking you to be friends with Sakuro-chan. In fact, you two make much better rivals.

2360
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:44,719
Rivals? Yeah. Well, not the kind that shanks the other in the back.

2361
03:57:44,719 --> 03:57:49,889
Compete. Puss each other. Get better. You'll bring up all the other girls with you.

2362
03:57:49,889 --> 03:57:55,879
Stop the accent. What? You don't like it? You guys don't like the accent?

2363
03:57:55,879 --> 03:58:01,059
You guys don't like it? You don't like it? You don't like it?

2364
03:58:01,059 --> 03:58:06,579
Right now. Right now. You're just tripping over each other.

2365
03:58:06,579 --> 03:58:09,879
And that makes it harder for everybody around you to step up.

2366
03:58:09,879 --> 03:58:15,639
Customers may love a gal like that, but I got no use for them here.

2367
03:58:15,639 --> 03:58:21,010
The grand needs girls who are popular with the guys and the girls.

2368
03:58:21,010 --> 03:58:23,440
The guys and the girls?

2369
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:26,680
Thing is, I know you could be that girl.

2370
03:58:26,680 --> 03:58:31,680
Kanae-chan, that's the only reason I'm coming down on you about it. I like this.

2371
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:36,370
You really think I'm... I'm sorry, sir. I was acting like a spoiled brat.

2372
03:58:36,370 --> 03:58:40,370
I work on being that girl. I'm being more considerate. Please, give me the chance.

2373
03:58:40,370 --> 03:58:45,540
There, see? You do get it. I knew you were a keeper.

2374
03:58:45,540 --> 03:58:47,969
I knew you were a keeper, kid.

2375
03:58:47,969 --> 03:58:51,850
And I hope you'll keep helping me improve when I need it.

2376
03:58:51,850 --> 03:58:58,360
Matthew McConaughey.

2377
03:58:58,360 --> 03:59:00,360
Ah, finally. Took long enough.

2378
03:59:00,360 --> 03:59:02,360
Shit.

2379
03:59:02,360 --> 03:59:05,489
And wait. What was that waiter's deal?

2380
03:59:05,489 --> 03:59:08,489
Can't have him zoning out on me like that.

2381
03:59:08,489 --> 03:59:10,670
Better go have a chat.

2382
03:59:10,670 --> 03:59:14,639
This car goes fast, but it's safe, too.

2383
03:59:14,639 --> 03:59:16,950
Know what I'm saying?

2384
03:59:16,950 --> 03:59:23,780
When you drive a Lincoln, sophistication is key.

2385
03:59:23,780 --> 03:59:39,250
Okay, cool. That worked.

2386
03:59:39,250 --> 03:59:41,250
What else can I do? I'm gonna talk to this guy.

2387
03:59:41,250 --> 03:59:46,159
Quit while you're ahead.

2388
03:59:46,159 --> 03:59:49,159
Why the long face? Need to use facilities?

2389
03:59:49,159 --> 03:59:53,969
Sir, no, no. I got a letter from my little sister back home.

2390
03:59:53,969 --> 03:59:55,969
Yeah? What's the word?

2391
03:59:55,969 --> 03:59:58,920
My father's sick, unfortunately.

2392
03:59:58,920 --> 04:00:04,159
The doc says he needs to be hospitalized, but the procedure they want to do runs 500,000.

2393
04:00:04,159 --> 04:00:06,520
But I ain't got that kind of cash.

2394
04:00:06,520 --> 04:00:08,760
Sorry to hear that.

2395
04:00:08,760 --> 04:00:11,760
You try asking the floor manager for advance?

2396
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:15,129
Another emergency a while back already forced me to ask for one.

2397
04:00:15,129 --> 04:00:17,129
I'm afraid if I ask again, I'll get canned.

2398
04:00:17,129 --> 04:00:19,129
Especially for so much.

2399
04:00:19,129 --> 04:00:22,819
You in the habit of breaking mirrors, kid?

2400
04:00:22,819 --> 04:00:25,819
Here, I'll spot you.

2401
04:00:25,819 --> 04:00:28,760
What? But sir, I can't.

2402
04:00:28,760 --> 04:00:32,069
Don't sweat it. You can always replace money.

2403
04:00:32,069 --> 04:00:38,459
Saying can be said about people. Once they're gone, that's it.

2404
04:00:38,459 --> 04:00:44,600
Sir, as I recall, you ain't been back home in a while.

2405
04:00:44,600 --> 04:00:48,840
Yeah? Take a few days off, too. Go visit your pops.

2406
04:00:48,840 --> 04:00:56,950
Gosh. Thank you, sir.

2407
04:00:56,950 --> 04:00:59,950
Only thing that matters right now is keeping this place running smooth.

2408
04:00:59,950 --> 04:01:03,190
I'll throw as much money at it as I need to.

2409
04:01:03,190 --> 04:01:05,489
I'm having fun. I don't care.

2410
04:01:05,489 --> 04:01:07,489
Looks like that's it for my staff troubles.

2411
04:01:07,489 --> 04:01:09,489
It's about time I checked in out of the hole.

2412
04:01:09,489 --> 04:01:11,489
See what's going on outside.

2413
04:01:14,010 --> 04:01:22,270
Ban that person for a day!

2414
04:01:22,270 --> 04:01:26,270
One of the customers is placing insane orders now that he knows he isn't paying for it.

2415
04:01:26,270 --> 04:01:29,510
He went down the line of our top vintage wines to start,

2416
04:01:29,510 --> 04:01:32,510
and he started on our best whiskeys and brandies.

2417
04:01:32,510 --> 04:01:35,840
Well, I mean, when you hear the words,

2418
04:01:35,840 --> 04:01:38,840
this guy's gonna pay for every drink, it's like,

2419
04:01:38,840 --> 04:01:41,840
okay, let's go to the bottom of the wine list.

2420
04:01:41,840 --> 04:01:43,840
Let's turn the page three times.

2421
04:01:43,840 --> 04:01:46,840
We're gonna go to the bottom.

2422
04:01:46,840 --> 04:01:50,780
Start at the priciest and work your way down the list, huh?

2423
04:01:50,780 --> 04:01:57,760
Guys, this is the only way he's going to read and comprehend the story.

2424
04:01:57,760 --> 04:02:00,760
Well, somebody gets it, but, okay.

2425
04:02:00,760 --> 04:02:02,760
Start at the priciest.

2426
04:02:05,829 --> 04:02:07,069
Shit.

2427
04:02:07,069 --> 04:02:09,069
Now, I haven't been paying attention.

2428
04:02:09,069 --> 04:02:12,069
I haven't been paying attention. I haven't read anything.

2429
04:02:12,069 --> 04:02:15,069
I haven't comprehended a word.

2430
04:02:15,069 --> 04:02:23,840
Right this way.

2431
04:02:23,840 --> 04:02:25,840
Fine, just do the accent.

2432
04:02:27,649 --> 04:02:30,020
Oh, goddammit.

2433
04:02:44,920 --> 04:02:49,049
We have to dodge this guy, too.

2434
04:03:11,399 --> 04:03:13,399
He's already such a dick.

2435
04:03:13,399 --> 04:03:17,639
Don't you think he'd be like, oh, my god, I'm doing all this expensive stuff.

2436
04:03:17,639 --> 04:03:21,520
Don't you think he'd be like, oh, my god, I'm doing all this expensive shit.

2437
04:03:21,520 --> 04:03:23,520
Yeah, what can I do for you?

2438
04:03:23,520 --> 04:03:25,520
All right, I'll cool it. I'll cool it.

2439
04:03:25,520 --> 04:03:27,520
I won't order anymore. I'm sorry.

2440
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:30,520
I've got a little ahead of myself.

2441
04:03:30,520 --> 04:03:36,020
I have to be his dick.

2442
04:04:10,440 --> 04:04:14,750
I don't know. I thought I was going to microwave the cigarettes.

2443
04:04:14,750 --> 04:04:16,750
I've got to reheat these cigarettes.

2444
04:04:16,750 --> 04:04:18,750
They're getting cold.

2445
04:04:30,239 --> 04:04:32,239
Oh, that's not even a microwave.

2446
04:04:32,239 --> 04:04:34,239
It's a hot towel bin.

2447
04:04:43,620 --> 04:04:46,819
You get a raid?

2448
04:04:46,819 --> 04:04:48,819
Who raided?

2449
04:04:48,819 --> 04:04:50,819
Raid? I don't see a raid.

2450
04:04:50,819 --> 04:04:53,489
Where? Where? I don't see one.

2451
04:04:53,489 --> 04:04:57,590
I don't see a raid. Who raided?

2452
04:04:57,590 --> 04:04:59,760
Is it your raid? I don't see it anywhere.

2453
04:05:07,059 --> 04:05:11,030
Whoever raided it, he did.

2454
04:05:11,030 --> 04:05:16,399
What's up? Thanks.

2455
04:05:16,399 --> 04:05:18,399
I don't see it anywhere.

2456
04:05:22,399 --> 04:05:24,399
What happened?

2457
04:05:24,399 --> 04:05:31,040
Oh.

2458
04:05:34,600 --> 04:05:36,600
I'm sorry.

2459
04:05:36,600 --> 04:05:38,600
I'm sorry.

2460
04:05:54,959 --> 04:05:56,959
What's up?

2461
04:05:56,959 --> 04:05:58,959
I don't see a raid.

2462
04:05:58,959 --> 04:06:00,959
I don't see a raid.

2463
04:06:00,959 --> 04:06:08,120
I don't see a raid.

2464
04:06:08,120 --> 04:06:09,319
I did not expect that.

2465
04:06:10,770 --> 04:06:12,010
It's a shame.

2466
04:06:12,450 --> 04:06:16,889
You, who on the outside is jealous of others,

2467
04:06:16,909 --> 04:06:19,250
is all alone, in this town in search of something else.

2468
04:06:20,930 --> 04:06:24,750
People who call themselves happy are all doing the same as you.

2469
04:06:25,760 --> 04:06:27,579
Isn't the weather hot today?

2470
04:06:28,909 --> 04:06:32,129
I feel like I saw you in your dimples.

2471
04:06:33,049 --> 04:06:33,909
But, well.

2472
04:06:34,389 --> 04:06:38,389
This is the situation you're into, no?

2473
04:06:38,389 --> 04:07:01,780
Oh, this is punishment back in the Yakuza

2474
04:07:16,219 --> 04:07:20,790
Retainer to the fifth only Alliance chairman there was a lot I couldn't read it all

2475
04:07:21,569 --> 04:07:23,489
Anta New York, I don't need to know

2476
04:07:32,969 --> 04:07:33,969
This month I'm going to sell

2477
04:07:35,090 --> 04:07:38,729
This month's take is that I can keep a case you'll have your 100 million by next month

2478
04:07:40,329 --> 04:07:42,809
Oh, that's amazing

2479
04:07:44,120 --> 04:07:44,760
Don't be stupid

2480
04:07:45,959 --> 04:07:49,959
If you get it, I'll tell Shimano's dad that I can go back to the Gokudo

2481
04:07:51,200 --> 04:07:52,879
I haven't forgotten my promise

2482
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:57,379
Well, did you make that promise?

2483
04:07:58,770 --> 04:08:01,049
I'm not going to be able to make a joke out of this

2484
04:08:02,290 --> 04:08:02,969
No, you can't

2485
04:08:03,729 --> 04:08:06,170
I'll give you another 500 million

2486
04:08:06,170 --> 04:08:07,610
If you do that, I'll listen to you

2487
04:08:08,170 --> 04:08:08,969
That's bullshit

2488
04:08:10,500 --> 04:08:12,620
You weasley rat bastard

2489
04:08:13,500 --> 04:08:16,700
Oh, no, I can't do that

2490
04:08:17,340 --> 04:08:17,739
Shit

2491
04:08:18,620 --> 04:08:21,180
What? You're not going to hit me?

2492
04:08:21,180 --> 04:08:24,299
Well, I can't do it, but

2493
04:08:25,700 --> 04:08:26,659
I thought he was going to do it

2494
04:08:29,090 --> 04:08:30,329
If you do that

2495
04:08:31,219 --> 04:08:34,299
You're going to go back to that dark place

2496
04:08:35,329 --> 04:08:36,530
I don't want that

2497
04:08:36,530 --> 04:08:37,290
Oh shit

2498
04:08:39,579 --> 04:08:43,020
This is the way you want to go back to the world

2499
04:08:44,760 --> 04:08:46,920
Yakuza is like you

2500
04:08:47,559 --> 04:08:48,760
It's easy to let go

2501
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:49,719
Oh, you fuckers

2502
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:50,760
What do you think?

2503
04:08:51,780 --> 04:08:53,780
I think you should take revenge

2504
04:08:54,420 --> 04:09:07,440
I'll make a lot of money

2505
04:09:07,959 --> 04:09:12,219
If I do it to go back to Gokudo, I'll do anything

2506
04:09:12,860 --> 04:09:17,579
Oh, you're in the same debt pit as Mojima

2507
04:09:21,899 --> 04:09:22,780
I like Mojima

2508
04:09:22,780 --> 04:09:23,100
He's

2509
04:09:27,360 --> 04:09:29,399
2 billion, 3 billion, 4 billion

2510
04:09:30,559 --> 04:09:39,739
Add another 500 to the debt

2511
04:09:39,739 --> 04:09:40,180
Yeah

2512
04:09:54,030 --> 04:09:55,629
How much are you getting paid to play this game?

2513
04:09:56,629 --> 04:09:58,709
I don't know how much you guys gave me today

2514
04:10:01,110 --> 04:10:01,870
How about zero?

2515
04:10:16,260 --> 04:10:16,819
What about her?

2516
04:10:16,819 --> 04:10:17,940
Yeah, what's his deal?

2517
04:10:21,260 --> 04:10:22,139
Hey, what?

2518
04:10:26,090 --> 04:10:27,090
Oh, no

2519
04:10:29,209 --> 04:10:30,209
They're separating us

2520
04:10:34,479 --> 04:10:37,180
I'll do my best not to lose the deal

2521
04:10:37,180 --> 04:10:41,180
I have to earn 500,000 yen after all

2522
04:10:42,180 --> 04:10:51,440
That's not good

2523
04:11:02,270 --> 04:11:03,309
Pardon me, sir

2524
04:11:03,309 --> 04:11:06,989
I just got a call from Noriko-chan saying she's jumping ship to a different club

2525
04:11:08,780 --> 04:11:10,940
Yeah, I just found out

2526
04:11:10,940 --> 04:11:13,180
Did you know?

2527
04:11:13,180 --> 04:11:15,180
Why are you so sudden?

2528
04:11:15,180 --> 04:11:18,940
If Noriko-chan is gone, it will have a big impact on the sales

2529
04:11:20,319 --> 04:11:22,059
I know

2530
04:11:22,059 --> 04:11:23,899
But it's the owner's decision

2531
04:11:24,879 --> 04:11:26,989
There's nothing we can do about it

2532
04:11:26,989 --> 04:11:29,549
Is that so?

2533
04:11:29,549 --> 04:11:34,520
But what should we do from now on?

2534
04:11:34,520 --> 04:11:36,370
Damn it

2535
04:11:36,370 --> 04:11:37,569
There's no time to get depressed

2536
04:11:37,569 --> 04:11:38,489
Look at that, what about it?

2537
04:11:38,489 --> 04:11:41,530
Who's the hottest hostess in town that we don't already have?

2538
04:11:41,530 --> 04:11:45,469
Who's the hottest hostess in town that we don't already have?

2539
04:11:45,469 --> 04:11:47,469
A hostess from somewhere else?

2540
04:11:47,469 --> 04:11:51,420
If it's a girl from somewhere else, that's right

2541
04:11:51,420 --> 04:11:54,579
Nozomi-chan from Odyssey is the clear winner

2542
04:11:54,579 --> 04:11:57,020
She's a big part of why they're the strongest rival

2543
04:11:57,020 --> 04:11:59,500
Nozomi-chan from Odyssey is the clear winner

2544
04:11:59,500 --> 04:12:00,540
I see

2545
04:12:00,579 --> 04:12:01,819
Yeah?

2546
04:12:01,819 --> 04:12:02,819
Well then

2547
04:12:02,819 --> 04:12:04,819
Well then, I guess I'll be heading out

2548
04:12:04,819 --> 04:12:05,819
I guess I'll be heading out

2549
04:12:05,819 --> 04:12:06,819
Not too soon though

2550
04:12:06,819 --> 04:12:07,819
Not too soon though

2551
04:12:07,819 --> 04:12:08,819
Hey, Shion!

2552
04:12:08,819 --> 04:12:09,819
Where are you going?

2553
04:12:09,819 --> 04:12:11,059
See you around, kid

2554
04:12:11,059 --> 04:12:12,059
Of course I will

2555
04:12:12,059 --> 04:12:14,430
I'm going to take Nozomi out of our house

2556
04:12:14,430 --> 04:12:16,430
I'm going to be poaching Nozomi to come to our floor

2557
04:12:16,430 --> 04:12:18,430
Taking out the number one rival?

2558
04:12:18,430 --> 04:12:21,430
Isn't that bad?

2559
04:12:21,430 --> 04:12:24,430
How are we supposed to do that?

2560
04:12:24,430 --> 04:12:27,430
The world at night is full of evil

2561
04:12:27,430 --> 04:12:29,430
If we fall here, we'll be crushed

2562
04:12:29,469 --> 04:12:31,469
The strong eat the weak

2563
04:12:31,469 --> 04:12:32,469
We true

2564
04:12:32,469 --> 04:12:35,469
And the grand will come crumbling down in days

2565
04:12:35,469 --> 04:12:37,469
My job is to do what it takes

2566
04:12:37,469 --> 04:12:38,469
To...

2567
04:12:38,469 --> 04:12:41,469
Can you run back the prompter?

2568
04:12:41,469 --> 04:12:44,629
I'll get it again, don't worry

2569
04:12:44,629 --> 04:12:45,629
I promise

2570
04:12:45,629 --> 04:12:50,879
Alright, we gotta go get that other girl to come over here

2571
04:12:50,879 --> 04:12:51,879
And do...

2572
04:12:51,879 --> 04:12:53,879
And be at our hotel

2573
04:12:57,770 --> 04:12:59,770
Netflix dub

2574
04:13:04,379 --> 04:13:07,979
Do karaoke?

2575
04:13:07,979 --> 04:13:09,219
I did karaoke

2576
04:13:09,219 --> 04:13:11,219
I wanna go check out the town

2577
04:13:11,260 --> 04:13:12,260
Do I have access to the town now?

2578
04:13:12,260 --> 04:13:16,680
You know what a cabaret is?

2579
04:13:16,680 --> 04:13:17,860
Yeah

2580
04:13:17,860 --> 04:13:31,260
It's a...

2581
04:13:31,260 --> 04:13:33,579
It's like a performance

2582
04:13:33,579 --> 04:13:37,579
It's a short performance of music and theater and dance

2583
04:13:37,579 --> 04:13:41,079
Like a bunch of dancing and singing and performances

2584
04:13:41,079 --> 04:13:44,110
Go to Odyssey

2585
04:13:44,110 --> 04:13:47,110
Ooh, okay, we have a town here

2586
04:13:47,110 --> 04:13:48,420
Oh, look at this

2587
04:13:48,420 --> 04:13:49,420
Okay, what's this?

2588
04:13:49,420 --> 04:13:50,420
Shot bar

2589
04:13:50,420 --> 04:13:52,420
Bart with darts and pool

2590
04:13:52,420 --> 04:13:55,870
There's the cabaret

2591
04:13:55,870 --> 04:13:57,819
There's...

2592
04:13:57,819 --> 04:13:58,819
Oh, and the arcade

2593
04:13:58,819 --> 04:14:04,020
Alright, we'll go to the bars with darts and pool

2594
04:14:04,059 --> 04:14:06,010
Let's go

2595
04:14:07,500 --> 04:14:08,500
You there

2596
04:14:08,500 --> 04:14:10,899
Huh?

2597
04:14:10,899 --> 04:14:19,639
You are the master of the Hell House, the Grand, yes?

2598
04:14:19,639 --> 04:14:20,639
Yeah

2599
04:14:20,639 --> 04:14:21,639
Yeah, that's me

2600
04:14:21,639 --> 04:14:22,639
I knew it

2601
04:14:22,639 --> 04:14:24,639
Even the way you walk is refined

2602
04:14:24,639 --> 04:14:26,639
Guarded, you have no blind spot

2603
04:14:26,639 --> 04:14:27,639
Despite appearances

2604
04:14:27,639 --> 04:14:31,069
I'm sorry, sir, have we met before?

2605
04:14:31,069 --> 04:14:33,069
My name is Sumotaro Komike

2606
04:14:33,069 --> 04:14:37,069
Heir to a certain form of martial arts in its present master

2607
04:14:37,069 --> 04:14:38,569
Martial arts?

2608
04:14:38,569 --> 04:14:41,940
Yes, but lately I've felt my technique slipping

2609
04:14:41,979 --> 04:14:43,979
My edge has been dulled

2610
04:14:43,979 --> 04:14:46,979
So I left the lights of Tokyo in order to train

2611
04:14:46,979 --> 04:14:50,280
Yet even here I find this age of excess

2612
04:14:50,280 --> 04:14:53,280
Gluttons and fools gorging on carnal pleasures

2613
04:14:53,280 --> 04:14:55,280
Nobody hungers anymore

2614
04:14:55,280 --> 04:14:58,709
Then I heard talk of a lounge called the Grand

2615
04:14:58,709 --> 04:15:02,709
They said it was the home of a most interesting man

2616
04:15:02,709 --> 04:15:04,530
Pardon my answer

2617
04:15:04,530 --> 04:15:07,899
But have you visited our establishment before?

2618
04:15:07,899 --> 04:15:09,520
What kind of question is that?

2619
04:15:09,520 --> 04:15:12,520
Guttling booze with painted ladies hanging all over you

2620
04:15:12,559 --> 04:15:14,559
Bah! Wanted excess

2621
04:15:14,559 --> 04:15:16,559
Of course I haven't been there

2622
04:15:16,559 --> 04:15:22,139
Well, then why the hell am I doing song and dance if you ain't accustomed?

2623
04:15:22,139 --> 04:15:26,450
Besides, that's a washed-up martial art as well with me

2624
04:15:26,450 --> 04:15:28,819
That hungry air about you

2625
04:15:28,819 --> 04:15:31,819
It is far beyond the men I've fought in recent years

2626
04:15:31,819 --> 04:15:33,819
Would you do me the honor?

2627
04:15:33,819 --> 04:15:36,569
What honor would that be?

2628
04:15:36,569 --> 04:15:38,569
Want me to fight you?

2629
04:15:38,569 --> 04:15:39,569
Precisely

2630
04:15:39,569 --> 04:15:41,569
A deeper strength sleeps within you

2631
04:15:41,610 --> 04:15:44,610
I refuse to let it lie dormant and unused any longer

2632
04:15:44,610 --> 04:15:46,610
What?

2633
04:15:46,610 --> 04:15:48,909
You okay upstairs, pal?

2634
04:15:48,909 --> 04:15:51,909
You don't earn me skinny hands profit

2635
04:15:51,909 --> 04:15:54,280
Busy gal

2636
04:15:54,280 --> 04:15:55,280
Busy guy

2637
04:15:55,280 --> 04:15:58,280
Hide behind your merchant's guise all you like

2638
04:15:58,280 --> 04:16:00,280
I know money isn't what feeds that hunger

2639
04:16:00,280 --> 04:16:02,280
Whatever honest life you make

2640
04:16:02,280 --> 04:16:05,280
A show of living I can see the demon gnawing at you inside

2641
04:16:05,280 --> 04:16:06,280
Hmm

2642
04:16:06,280 --> 04:16:10,459
There's only one way to appease the demon, son

2643
04:16:10,500 --> 04:16:12,500
Face the strong in combat

2644
04:16:12,500 --> 04:16:15,500
And set loose those fighting instincts struggling to burst free

2645
04:16:15,500 --> 04:16:19,260
And you're telling me you're that strong guy?

2646
04:16:19,260 --> 04:16:21,260
Oh, as it happens, I am

2647
04:16:21,260 --> 04:16:23,260
Now do you see a reason to face me?

2648
04:16:23,260 --> 04:16:25,260
Not that it will stay any...

2649
04:16:25,260 --> 04:16:27,260
It won't be very easy for you

2650
04:16:27,260 --> 04:16:29,879
There's no talking sense to you, is there?

2651
04:16:29,879 --> 04:16:31,440
Fine

2652
04:16:31,440 --> 04:16:33,440
You win

2653
04:16:33,440 --> 04:16:36,440
I was just thinking it had been a while since I really cut loose

2654
04:16:36,440 --> 04:16:37,440
Not here though

2655
04:16:37,440 --> 04:16:38,440
Somewhere

2656
04:16:38,440 --> 04:16:39,440
Somewhere

2657
04:16:39,440 --> 04:16:40,739
Not here

2658
04:16:40,780 --> 04:16:44,110
Hmm, if you insist

2659
04:16:44,110 --> 04:16:45,110
Who talks like that?

2660
04:16:45,110 --> 04:16:53,840
Me

2661
04:16:53,840 --> 04:16:54,840
This place should work

2662
04:16:54,840 --> 04:16:57,020
Hmm, you are awfully...

2663
04:16:57,020 --> 04:16:58,020
It's a different guy

2664
04:16:58,020 --> 04:16:59,020
You are... It's the same person

2665
04:16:59,020 --> 04:17:01,020
You are awfully unhesitant to agree...

2666
04:17:01,020 --> 04:17:02,020
I wasn't paying attention

2667
04:17:02,020 --> 04:17:06,020
In agreeing to this, I am starting to think you keep the true extent of your strength hidden away

2668
04:17:06,020 --> 04:17:10,659
You must have your reasons, I know I have mine

2669
04:17:10,659 --> 04:17:12,659
For the fist is like the sword

2670
04:17:12,659 --> 04:17:14,659
Leave it in its sheath to rust

2671
04:17:14,659 --> 04:17:16,659
And you will not be able to draw it when it is needed

2672
04:17:16,659 --> 04:17:18,840
What say you?

2673
04:17:18,879 --> 04:17:20,879
Do you feel an urge to shrug off your restraints

2674
04:17:20,879 --> 04:17:22,879
And fight to the full extent of your abilities for a change?

2675
04:17:22,879 --> 04:17:25,950
You're offering?

2676
04:17:25,950 --> 04:17:26,950
I'm game

2677
04:17:26,950 --> 04:17:28,950
Not too big on the idea of opening up a can

2678
04:17:28,950 --> 04:17:30,950
Of a creaky old guy like you

2679
04:17:30,950 --> 04:17:32,190
Though

2680
04:17:32,190 --> 04:17:37,540
Fuck

2681
04:17:37,540 --> 04:17:40,680
No, cast aside such worries

2682
04:17:40,680 --> 04:17:41,680
He even doddled to the edge left

2683
04:17:41,680 --> 04:17:43,680
And these should prove sufficient to handle a pup like you

2684
04:17:43,680 --> 04:17:45,680
Show me everything you've got

2685
04:17:45,680 --> 04:17:48,260
He's throwing

2686
04:17:48,260 --> 04:17:49,260
Alright, I'm done

2687
04:17:49,260 --> 04:17:55,700
A thug style incorporates a number of merciless attacks

2688
04:17:55,700 --> 04:17:57,700
One of these is the eye pope

2689
04:17:57,739 --> 04:18:00,049
You land an eye poke attack

2690
04:18:00,049 --> 04:18:02,049
The enemy will turn their back to you in pain

2691
04:18:02,049 --> 04:18:04,930
Eye poke?

2692
04:18:14,319 --> 04:18:20,139
Holy shit, I just dropped him

2693
04:18:20,139 --> 04:18:22,139
One of the special moves of the thug style

2694
04:18:22,139 --> 04:18:24,139
Is a heat action called the essence of choking

2695
04:18:24,139 --> 04:18:27,139
This heat action triggers when an enemy attacks you

2696
04:18:27,139 --> 04:18:29,139
Or when you just circle behind them

2697
04:18:29,139 --> 04:18:31,959
Okay

2698
04:18:31,959 --> 04:18:33,959
The heat gauge at third press Y when an enemy attacks

2699
04:18:33,959 --> 04:18:35,959
Yeah, we've seen this

2700
04:18:35,959 --> 04:18:41,700
Oh my god, I just broke that fucking old dude's neck

2701
04:18:41,739 --> 04:18:51,739
Defeat him

2702
04:18:51,739 --> 04:18:52,739
And run at me, run at me

2703
04:18:52,739 --> 04:18:54,739
Come on, come get me

2704
04:18:54,739 --> 04:18:57,329
He'll snap his neck

2705
04:18:57,329 --> 04:19:03,149
The essence of murder

2706
04:19:04,149 --> 04:19:11,770
Holy shit

2707
04:19:11,770 --> 04:19:21,780
Dropping frames?

2708
04:19:21,780 --> 04:19:22,780
Am I?

2709
04:19:22,780 --> 04:19:26,129
Oh, I did drop some

2710
04:19:26,129 --> 04:19:32,420
We good?

2711
04:19:32,420 --> 04:19:37,159
Yeah, the internet's been a little weird here

2712
04:19:37,159 --> 04:19:39,159
The last couple of nights

2713
04:19:39,159 --> 04:19:42,680
I've had like small internet hiccups

2714
04:19:42,680 --> 04:19:44,680
Over the last like maybe two nights

2715
04:19:44,680 --> 04:19:54,920
No, it should be good

2716
04:19:54,920 --> 04:20:05,200
I mean, I haven't had internet problems in like a year

2717
04:20:05,200 --> 04:20:07,200
I mean, I'm on fiber

2718
04:20:07,239 --> 04:20:09,239
I have a thousand thousand

2719
04:20:09,239 --> 04:20:11,239
But sometimes I'm sure it can happen

2720
04:20:13,540 --> 04:20:25,260
I don't have my VPN on right now

2721
04:20:25,260 --> 04:20:27,260
But yeah, the last two nights

2722
04:20:27,260 --> 04:20:29,430
After like 8 o'clock at night

2723
04:20:29,430 --> 04:20:31,430
For some reason it's gotten like a little weird

2724
04:20:31,430 --> 04:20:33,430
I'll give him a call

2725
04:20:33,430 --> 04:20:37,780
See if anything's going on

2726
04:20:37,780 --> 04:20:49,430
Is it still dropping frames?

2727
04:20:49,430 --> 04:20:52,950
Oh, it is, yeah

2728
04:20:52,950 --> 04:20:56,729
Oh shit, it is, yeah

2729
04:20:56,729 --> 04:21:00,700
It is happening

2730
04:21:00,700 --> 04:21:02,700
It might be doing like maintenance or something

2731
04:21:02,739 --> 04:21:03,739
A few nights

2732
04:21:03,739 --> 04:21:06,680
Because it's been like the same time every night

2733
04:21:08,920 --> 04:21:11,120
I'll give him a call

2734
04:21:11,120 --> 04:21:19,500
See what's going on

2735
04:21:19,500 --> 04:21:21,500
Yeah, it's been like 8 months since there's been any internet problems

2736
04:21:21,500 --> 04:21:23,500
It's been perfect

2737
04:21:23,500 --> 04:21:26,000
I've had almost zero problems at all

2738
04:21:26,000 --> 04:21:28,000
But yeah, I'm definitely dropping a shitload of frames so I can see it

2739
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:45,729
Hold on, one sec

2740
04:21:45,729 --> 04:21:48,930
Let me just see what happens when I do this

2741
04:21:48,930 --> 04:21:52,260
Let's find out

2742
04:21:52,260 --> 04:21:58,979
Sorry about that

2743
04:21:58,979 --> 04:22:00,979
They're trying to block Majima

2744
04:22:01,020 --> 04:22:09,079
Yeah, this is the second night in a row

2745
04:22:09,079 --> 04:22:11,700
Oh yeah, no, this is bad

2746
04:22:11,700 --> 04:22:15,030
This is terrible

2747
04:22:15,030 --> 04:22:17,030
Terrible, terrible

2748
04:22:17,030 --> 04:22:19,909
I'm getting like 8 megabits down

2749
04:22:19,909 --> 04:22:22,340
And I have a thousand down

2750
04:22:22,340 --> 04:22:25,799
Literally like an hour ago, this was a thousand

2751
04:22:25,799 --> 04:22:27,799
Oh yeah, this is not good, something's wrong

2752
04:22:27,799 --> 04:22:30,229
I think they're doing maintenance or something

2753
04:22:30,229 --> 04:22:43,100
Your VPN? I don't have a VPN turned on right now

2754
04:22:43,100 --> 04:22:48,219
Facecam react

2755
04:22:48,219 --> 04:22:54,299
It's been the exact same time

2756
04:22:54,299 --> 04:22:56,299
Two days in a row

2757
04:22:56,299 --> 04:23:01,670
I think it looks like it's evening out a little bit

2758
04:23:01,709 --> 04:23:03,709
Sorry about that, it's going to be like that probably till I end

2759
04:23:10,340 --> 04:23:13,540
Alright, dude, come at me

2760
04:23:17,040 --> 04:23:21,010
Lime, well fiber is

2761
04:23:21,010 --> 04:23:23,250
It's fiber

2762
04:23:23,250 --> 04:23:25,250
The way that fiber works, you don't share it

2763
04:23:25,250 --> 04:23:35,420
It's not cable

2764
04:23:35,420 --> 04:23:39,840
So that's why when something like this happens

2765
04:23:39,840 --> 04:23:41,840
It's like they're doing something

2766
04:23:41,840 --> 04:23:54,639
I was on cable, if you remember

2767
04:23:54,639 --> 04:23:56,639
A year or two ago, a couple years ago, I was on cable

2768
04:23:56,680 --> 04:24:03,139
I've been on cable forever

2769
04:24:03,139 --> 04:24:05,450
You still share the line though

2770
04:24:05,450 --> 04:24:07,450
From my understanding, you don't share

2771
04:24:07,450 --> 04:24:09,450
A node with a fiber

2772
04:24:09,450 --> 04:24:11,450
With actual fiber line

2773
04:24:11,450 --> 04:24:13,450
Like a true fiber connection

2774
04:24:13,450 --> 04:24:15,450
Fiber to the house is not

2775
04:24:15,450 --> 04:24:17,450
A shared line with your neighborhood

2776
04:24:17,450 --> 04:24:31,260
Is this still happening?

2777
04:24:31,260 --> 04:24:38,170
Oh, a node

2778
04:24:38,170 --> 04:24:40,170
I'll do karaoke

2779
04:24:40,170 --> 04:24:42,469
Is it good now? Is it better?

2780
04:24:42,469 --> 04:24:45,159
Alright, I'm going to do

2781
04:24:45,159 --> 04:24:49,510
I want to do

2782
04:24:49,549 --> 04:24:51,549
Mahjong, mahjong, mahjong, mahjong

2783
04:24:51,549 --> 04:24:53,549
Mahjong, mahjong, mahjong, mahjong

2784
04:24:53,549 --> 04:24:55,549
Go, go, go, go, go, go

2785
04:24:55,549 --> 04:25:09,819
Let's go

2786
04:25:09,819 --> 04:25:11,819
At Mahjong Jambalaya, you can play at tables

2787
04:25:11,819 --> 04:25:13,819
With varying rates or participate in ranked matches

2788
04:25:13,819 --> 04:25:16,260
The tables are beginning, low, right, intermediate

2789
04:25:16,260 --> 04:25:18,260
High, advanced and high

2790
04:25:18,260 --> 04:25:20,260
The price to play and the strength of the opponents

2791
04:25:20,260 --> 04:25:22,260
Vary depending on the table

2792
04:25:22,260 --> 04:25:24,260
Ooh, alright, let's go

2793
04:25:24,260 --> 04:25:26,260
Let's go, let's go, let's go

2794
04:25:26,260 --> 04:25:28,819
Oh, I don't have any money

2795
04:25:28,819 --> 04:25:31,120
I don't have any money

2796
04:25:31,159 --> 04:25:36,219
Sorry, I don't have any money

2797
04:25:36,219 --> 04:25:40,379
Going to the casino

2798
04:25:40,379 --> 04:25:42,379
Alright, I'm ready to play at the casino

2799
04:25:42,379 --> 04:25:44,379
Okay, sir, what's your bet?

2800
04:25:44,379 --> 04:25:46,379
I don't have any money, I just wanted to come in

2801
04:25:46,379 --> 04:25:50,020
And play

2802
04:25:50,020 --> 04:25:52,840
What's over here? This is Mahjong

2803
04:25:52,840 --> 04:26:11,020
Darts, did you just stop me?

2804
04:26:11,020 --> 04:26:13,020
Don't stop me, I want to go play darts

2805
04:26:23,690 --> 04:26:25,989
What can I get you?

2806
04:26:25,989 --> 04:26:28,860
You can get me

2807
04:26:28,860 --> 04:26:31,350
None of this

2808
04:26:31,350 --> 04:26:35,450
I want to play darts

2809
04:26:35,489 --> 04:26:37,489
I want to play darts

2810
04:26:37,489 --> 04:26:39,729
Wasn't this a dart place?

2811
04:26:39,729 --> 04:26:41,969
Dying again? Fuck

2812
04:26:41,969 --> 04:26:45,920
No

2813
04:26:45,920 --> 04:26:48,930
Shit, it is

2814
04:26:48,930 --> 04:26:53,090
I got to call them

2815
04:26:53,090 --> 04:26:55,090
I got to call it here

2816
04:26:55,090 --> 04:27:04,500
Fuck

2817
04:27:04,500 --> 04:27:06,500
Sorry guys

2818
04:27:06,500 --> 04:27:08,500
I'm going to call the internet company

2819
04:27:08,500 --> 04:27:10,500
It's just not supposed to be happening

2820
04:27:10,500 --> 04:27:12,500
And by the way, this is the

2821
04:27:12,500 --> 04:27:14,500
First problem in like a year

2822
04:27:14,500 --> 04:27:16,500
It's been rock solid

2823
04:27:16,540 --> 04:27:18,540
So, something's going on

2824
04:27:18,540 --> 04:27:20,709
Let me just figure out what it is

2825
04:27:20,709 --> 04:27:26,540
So I'll be back

2826
04:27:26,540 --> 04:27:29,100
Tomorrow

2827
04:27:29,100 --> 04:27:31,100
If I

2828
04:27:31,100 --> 04:27:33,100
Kind of cold gets worse

2829
04:27:33,100 --> 04:27:35,100
I might take tomorrow and just not stream

2830
04:27:35,100 --> 04:27:38,340
Save the game, I will

2831
04:27:38,340 --> 04:27:40,340
I think doing like the voices may have

2832
04:27:40,340 --> 04:27:43,930
Caused a little bit more of a problem

2833
04:27:43,930 --> 04:27:45,930
But I got to call

2834
04:27:45,930 --> 04:27:47,930
And see what's going on, because this is definitely not supposed to be happening

2835
04:27:47,930 --> 04:27:51,579
I had a lot of fun though

2836
04:27:51,579 --> 04:27:54,069
I'm going to play it again

2837
04:27:54,110 --> 04:27:56,110
When I come back, if it's not tomorrow

2838
04:27:56,110 --> 04:27:58,110
Then listen to me

2839
04:27:58,110 --> 04:28:00,110
Okay, when I come back tomorrow, we're going to have so much fun

2840
04:28:00,110 --> 04:28:02,350
If I shouldn't have done so many

2841
04:28:02,350 --> 04:28:04,350
Of those throat things

2842
04:28:04,350 --> 04:28:07,229
Where the sound comes out

2843
04:28:07,229 --> 04:28:09,229
If I'm not live tomorrow, I'll see you guys

2844
04:28:09,229 --> 04:28:11,659
The day after that, which would be

2845
04:28:11,659 --> 04:28:13,659
Saturday

2846
04:28:13,659 --> 04:28:15,659
So, plan on Saturday, I might turn it on tomorrow

2847
04:28:15,659 --> 04:28:17,659
But I'm going to call the internet company right now

2848
04:28:17,659 --> 04:28:20,290
And see what the hell is going on

2849
04:28:20,290 --> 04:28:22,290
But that is going to end this stream

2850
04:28:22,290 --> 04:28:25,299
We'll do Yakuza again

2851
04:28:25,340 --> 04:28:28,729
I like it, I wouldn't stream the game

2852
04:28:28,729 --> 04:28:33,719
Three times in a row if I didn't like it

2853
04:28:33,719 --> 04:28:36,860
I'll see you guys either tomorrow or Saturday

2854
04:28:36,860 --> 04:28:38,860
Have a great rest of your night

2855
04:28:38,860 --> 04:28:40,860
Thanks for watching everybody

2856
04:28:40,860 --> 04:28:42,860
Sorry, we're kind of ending like half hour 45 minutes early

2857
04:28:42,860 --> 04:28:45,479
I didn't want to end right now, but you've got to catch it

2858
04:28:45,479 --> 04:28:48,040
And make sure nothing's going on that I have to fix or something

2859
04:28:48,040 --> 04:28:50,729
I'll see you guys soon

2860
04:28:50,729 --> 04:28:55,340
Let's do the ending credits here

2861
04:28:55,340 --> 04:29:00,459
Here come the subs

2862
04:29:00,459 --> 04:29:02,459
Thanks everybody for subbing as always

2863
04:29:02,459 --> 04:29:06,040
Really appreciate it

2864
04:29:06,040 --> 04:29:08,040
Saving the game, you can even hear it, trust me

2865
04:29:08,079 --> 04:29:11,329
You can hear me saving

2866
04:29:11,329 --> 04:29:13,329
See, I just shoved the guy

2867
04:29:13,329 --> 04:29:15,329
I just pushed the guy like into the street

2868
04:29:15,329 --> 04:29:20,299
Here we go

2869
04:29:20,299 --> 04:29:32,700
Okay

2870
04:29:32,700 --> 04:29:36,100
Alrighty, raid, raid, raid

2871
04:29:36,100 --> 04:29:38,100
Who's streaming, let's see

2872
04:29:38,100 --> 04:29:46,340
Who's live right now

2873
04:29:46,340 --> 04:29:48,340
We have

2874
04:29:48,340 --> 04:29:53,840
Uhhhh

2875
04:29:53,840 --> 04:29:57,409
Alright, we're going to raid Neander's

2876
04:29:57,409 --> 04:30:01,889
Raid Vinny

2877
04:30:01,889 --> 04:30:03,889
Vinny's, what do you mean Vinny

2878
04:30:03,889 --> 04:30:06,379
Vinny's not live

2879
04:30:06,420 --> 04:30:09,430
Hey, I

2880
04:30:09,430 --> 04:30:16,020
I'm a Neanderth supporter

2881
04:30:16,020 --> 04:30:18,020
Yeah, let's go raid Neanderth

2882
04:30:18,020 --> 04:30:23,530
I never catch her live

2883
04:30:23,530 --> 04:30:29,350
Neanderth is a Vtuber

2884
04:30:29,350 --> 04:30:31,350
She's very funny

2885
04:30:31,350 --> 04:30:34,420
Am I a Neanderthal?

2886
04:30:34,420 --> 04:30:39,030
Of course I am

2887
04:30:39,030 --> 04:30:41,780
Look at me

2888
04:30:41,780 --> 04:30:45,239
What's she doing, playing away out

2889
04:30:45,239 --> 04:30:48,309
That'll be interesting

2890
04:30:48,309 --> 04:30:50,309
I'll see you guys later

2891
04:30:50,309 --> 04:30:52,870
I'm going to go drink some hot tea

2892
04:30:52,870 --> 04:30:54,870
Go tell Neanderth I said hello

2893
04:30:54,909 --> 04:30:58,559
You're going to be there in a second

2894
04:30:58,559 --> 04:31:00,559
I'll see you guys later

2895
04:31:00,559 --> 04:31:04,270
Take care, goodbye

2896
04:31:04,270 --> 04:31:09,700
If I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see you Saturday

2897
04:31:09,700 --> 04:31:11,700
Go, go, go, go

2898
04:31:11,700 --> 04:31:13,700
Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid

2899
04:31:13,700 --> 04:31:16,829
Everybody raid

2900
04:31:16,829 --> 04:31:18,829
Raid, raid, raid, raid

2901
04:31:18,829 --> 04:31:23,629
Raid, raid, raid

2902
04:31:23,629 --> 04:31:25,629
Raid, raid, raid

2903
04:31:25,629 --> 04:31:27,629
Get that up to 5k

2904
04:31:27,629 --> 04:31:29,809
Get that up to 5k

2905
04:31:29,809 --> 04:31:31,809
Or I'm not pressing it

2906
04:31:31,809 --> 04:31:37,250
Go, go, go, go

2907
04:31:37,290 --> 04:31:39,290
Get that up to 5k

2908
04:31:39,290 --> 04:31:43,260
People are leaving it

2909
04:31:43,260 --> 04:31:45,260
No, get that shit up to 5k

2910
04:31:45,260 --> 04:31:48,780
We're going with a 5k raid

2911
04:31:48,780 --> 04:31:51,659
Get on there

2912
04:31:51,659 --> 04:31:53,659
49, let's go

2913
04:31:53,659 --> 04:31:55,659
49, 49, 49, 49

2914
04:31:55,659 --> 04:31:57,659
Come on, stop leaving

2915
04:31:57,659 --> 04:32:00,020
Join it, don't leave it

2916
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:02,020
No, no, stop it, stop fighting

2917
04:32:02,020 --> 04:32:05,290
Just join it

2918
04:32:05,290 --> 04:32:07,290
You only got like 10 more seconds before you

2919
04:32:07,290 --> 04:32:09,979
You better get that to 5k or I'm going to be real mad

2920
04:32:09,979 --> 04:32:11,979
5k, you only got like 15 more seconds

2921
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:14,020
Go, go, go, go, go

2922
04:32:14,020 --> 04:32:17,790
5k, 5k, 5k, 5k

2923
04:32:17,790 --> 04:32:19,790
You're almost there, you got it

2924
04:32:19,790 --> 04:32:23,440
Come on, do it

2925
04:32:23,440 --> 04:32:25,739
You gotta give me that 5k

2926
04:32:25,739 --> 04:32:27,739
You got like 5 seconds

2927
04:32:27,739 --> 04:32:29,739
Get up there, get up there

2928
04:32:29,739 --> 04:32:31,979
Come on, it's so close

2929
04:32:31,979 --> 04:32:33,979
It's right there

2930
04:32:33,979 --> 04:32:35,979
Oh no

2931
04:32:35,979 --> 04:32:37,979
Yeah, I'll see you later
