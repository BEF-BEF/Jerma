00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,380
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerema here with a Team Fortress 2 Gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:26,550
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Medic. It's been a million years. I know, I'm sorry. My last Medic video was like, at least two months ago.

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:36,549
I mean, I've done live commentaries and, of course, livestream stuff with the Medic, but I haven't done a sit-down, discussion-thought-out Medic commentary since I was like 11 years old.

4
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:43,979
We are gonna change that right now. Gonna talk about the Kritzkrieg. Gonna bring up why it is my favorite out of all the Medic guns.

5
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,979
Well, there's only three, but it is my favorite out of the three. There's a couple of different reasons for that, and I will get into them.

6
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:58,219
But I also want to talk about computer upgrades in this video as well, because I just bought a bunch of them, and I spent all last night putting it all together.

7
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:06,219
And it can be kind of a headache, and it can be really irritating sometimes, but the end result is awesome. I have pretty much a brand new computer.

8
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:14,459
It's like taking the engine out of a Chevy and putting it into something else, you know what I mean? It's still the same case, but it's got different stuff in it.

9
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:23,459
And, of course, I want to tell you what stuff I put into it. But first, we're gonna talk about the Kritzkrieg right now.

10
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,459
What kind of transition was that? What am I, introducing a king?

11
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:38,430
And here he is, your grace, the almighty Kritzkrieg. All hail the Kritzkrieg, your grace. I'm watching too many episodes of Game of Thrones.

12
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:46,799
Anyways, the Kritzkrieg is my favorite pub medigun. Now, specifically because of the word I just used, pub.

13
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,980
This is the easiest medigun to jump into a game and just play with, because you never really have to coordinate Ubers.

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:03,150
This is the only medigun where if you pop an Uber on somebody, Kritzkrieg on someone, it doesn't matter if you timed it right or if there's a sentry around the corner or something like that.

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,150
When you use the Kritzkrieg, you are gonna get some benefit no matter who you do it to or when you do it.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,150
As long as you're weary of people's reload times, that's the number one thing you need to remember.

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:23,520
Because if you pop a Kritzkrieg randomly on a soldier, a demo man, or really anybody that has to reload their weapon, you're kind of putting yourself in a bad situation.

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,699
Because they might not even have anything to shoot. And even if they do, even if they have one or two rockets or one or two grenades or something,

19
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,699
you put them in a freakout mode, because they go, why? How many times does that happen to you?

20
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,699
It happens to me all the time when I get Kritzkrieg'd and I have one rocket or two rockets inside of my rocket launcher.

21
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:46,699
And I go, okay, hold on, do I shoot? No, reload. And you can make the person really, really uncomfortable.

22
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,699
So remember that when you have your Kritzkrieg ready to go.

23
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:56,189
Besides that, and of course knowing where enemies are and if there's gonna be more than one or two people around a corner,

24
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,189
that's the only coordination you need with the Kritzkrieg, at least in a public game standpoint.

25
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:06,189
Now with the Uber Charge or even with the Quick Fix, you need to know where sentries are.

26
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,189
You need to know who to Uber. You need to know when to do it.

27
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,189
But with the Kritzkrieg, a lot of that pressure is taken off your shoulders and you just become a healer.

28
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:19,189
You don't have to worry about really anything else. And if you Kritzkrieg somebody, oh, I Kritzkrieg that soldier.

29
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:23,430
What did he do? Kill two people? Sick. Nice job, dude.

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,430
It's not like with the Uber where you do it to somebody, turn a corner, sentries there.

31
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,430
Sentry doesn't go down and everyone is just like...

32
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,349
That doesn't really happen. But it does need to be noted that this kind of carefree Kritzkrieg...

33
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,349
I just made a tongue twister right there. Kind of carefree Kritzkrieg.

34
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:51,530
This style only really works when there's another medic on the team that's using regular Uber or you're on defense.

35
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,530
Because obviously if you're on offense and there's a bunch of sentries around, you're not going to be able to really push anywhere.

36
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:03,090
So keep that in mind. So with that, let's transition to talking about computer parts.

37
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,090
I want to bring up this because I'm so excited. I just got three new additions to this little home of a computer here.

38
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:17,089
I got a GTX 670 and I used to have a GTX 470. So that's the video card upgrade. I'm loving that. It's awesome.

39
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,089
It's so much cooler than the 470. I will say that. Oh my God.

40
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:33,089
My 470, I used to have to put the fans up to 75% to keep games like Team Fortress or even Diablo 3 to stop from running at like 90 degrees Celsius.

41
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,089
That's how insane that is. So that's a huge upgrade for me.

42
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:42,089
The second big thing is I got six more gigs of RAM. So instead of six gigs now I have 12 gigs.

43
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,089
Which is obviously going to help so much with video editing.

44
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:50,089
And I got another hard drive. So I have a brand new 7200 RPM hard drive in here now, internal.

45
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:55,459
I was using an external hard drive for a lot of my recording stuff through eSATA.

46
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,459
So I'm glad to throw that thing in the garbage. Get rid of it. I hated that thing.

47
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,759
The one thing I could not upgrade, which it's kind of, if you're going to do that, you might as well buy a new computer.

48
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,939
I wanted to upgrade the processor. I have a 950, i7 950 in here. It's overclocked and it's getting kind of old, which scares me a little bit.

49
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,939
But I couldn't really do anything about it. I think the sockets in this thing and this motherboard only allow the old generation i7s.

50
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,300
So I wouldn't even be able to get one of the new ones. I'm not that concerned about it though.

51
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,800
I got these upgrades. I'm good to go for a while. I'll cross the processor bridge when I have to, but for now I'm fine.

52
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,800
So that wraps up this video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,800
And I'll catch you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
