1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,309
Is that uh, is that, is that electricity on your head?

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:07,870
That is, that is electricity on my face.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,869
So, so that's a new unusual. Is that like one of the new ones?

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,240
That's, that's one of the new ones.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,439
Cool. I'll give you a high five, bro.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,440
Yay! Oh!

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Electricity!

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,480
You okay, mate?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:39,820
The Sneeze Gun.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,820
If I had a name tag, I would just rename this to the Sneeze Gun right now.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
I don't have any name tags, but I will.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Eventually this will be the Sneeze Gun and

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,719
you'll understand why very shortly.

14
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,799
Alright.

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,039
Who wants to get destroyed

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,920
by the Sneeze Gun?

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,920
This scout right here? Did you say you wanted to get

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
sneezed on?

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Oh, okay. What about the spy?

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,859
Oh, he's already dead.

21
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,859
Oh, man.

22
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm sorry, I can't control my cold!

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,170
Oh!

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,310
I'm gonna get headshot.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:32,500
Man, I gotta call into work today.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,159
God, I'm sorry, guys.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
Oh.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,959
I really gotta put on one of those masks.

29
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,319
So sorry about all that.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,349
Now you just sound like Ace Ventura.

31
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,799
I forget which part,

32
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,799
but it's the part where he's like

33
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,799
When he's climbing out the

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,799
rhino's ass, there you go.

35
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,799
And he's just like

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,430
When he's climbing out the

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
rhino's ass.

38
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,060
It actually worked!

39
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,419
I wanna get up there.

40
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,560
BAM! Wow, that was pretty brutal.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
I like took his head off.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,870
I took his head clean off with that swing.

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,300
And that guy.

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
And this guy.

45
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,479
No, don't kill me.

46
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,039
I'm just a DMO man.

47
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,240
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,210
Spy! Get out of here, spy!

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Have you been sword fighting again, German?

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
No, dude! Dude, I'm still here!

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Sword fighting!

52
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,139
I killed the answers!

53
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,780
Please let me live!

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,250
Let me live!

55
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Is this guy seriously just gonna stand right here?

56
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,509
He's not gonna let me do this, is he?

57
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,099
Please don't put a sentry here, Engie.

58
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,100
Please don't do it.

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
He's trying.

60
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,730
Don't do it, dude.

61
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,029
Did he?

62
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,089
Hey, DMO, come over here, mate.

63
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,089
There's a prize.

64
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,259
Hold on a second.

65
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,259
I'll help you out, mate. I'll help you out.

66
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,509
Wow.

67
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,509
Well, if anybody

68
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,509
walks down there on the rail,

69
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,509
they're fucking dead.

70
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,779
Oh my god, dude. This is gonna

71
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,779
instantly kill anyone that comes

72
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,779
over here. Even if they take a peep through that window,

73
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,620
they are fucked.

74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
I would move this, but I think we should just keep it here

75
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
for decorations. I think it looks

76
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,620
kind of pretty. We should all get Wranglers

77
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,620
and get just big bubbles.

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Yeah, this is gonna be good.

79
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
Oh, look. This person on the cart.

80
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Sentry's gone. Now's your chance.

81
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,620
Do it! Sentry!

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
They didn't do shit!

83
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
They didn't do anything.

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
It's cause I've bubbled mine. I wanna get

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
a good view.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,620
Oh, look how good we are.

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
We build three sentries.

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,620
He's coming up the stairs.

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Where is he? This asshole. This spy.

90
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,300
He's got my...

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,480
You'll recognize him. There he is. There's two of us.

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,779
What?

93
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,779
I don't know which one is you.

94
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,779
I'm chasing him right now.

95
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,779
Oh, so you're the one. Are you in front of him?

96
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,779
There we go. There's another one.

97
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,329
I seriously did not...

98
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,329
Oh, there he is. He's here again.

99
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,329
He's going up the evil stairs to stab me.

100
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,329
Get him! No! He face stabbed me!

101
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,399
Why is he doing this

102
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,399
to me all the time? He face stabbed me twice.

103
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,399
I hate spies.

104
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,399
Shit.

105
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,069
I'm gonna get some metal first.

106
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,819
Alright, let's go. We gotta hurry up.

107
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,470
We got like a train to catch.

108
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,100
Oh, the sentry train.

109
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
We gotta get on that payload train.

110
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Three, two, one. Moving on.

111
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,189
Let's do it.

112
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,189
If I get backstabbed and this dies, I will be so upset.

113
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,189
On the railroad.

114
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,879
On a live long day.

115
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,879
Keep going. Keep going.

116
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,879
Oh, keep going? Cause I... No!

117
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,629
Keep going, he says.

118
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,629
Keep going.

119
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,629
We must push further up the hill.

120
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:44,120
We're doing the upward

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
parade of engineers. I protect you,

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
you protect me. I don't see a spy.

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Pyro! Pyro! Pyro! Pyro! What?

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
And a scout! Put it down! Put it down!

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Quick! Get him down!

126
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
I don't have any metal!

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Yours is facing the wrong way!

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
There's a spy!

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
There's a spy! Oh, no!

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
No!

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Yours is facing the wrong way!

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
He's trying to stair stab me.

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,300
He's gonna face stab me again, I know it.

134
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
He's dead. Alright, my sentry

135
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
died. He just poked it

136
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
once cause it got sapped to shit.

137
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,860
I ran out of metal.

138
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,350
This is shit.

139
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,529
I need more metal.

140
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,740
Put him down!

141
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,420
We're gonna win. Alright, quick, get him in.

142
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,240
Get him inside before we win.

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Get him in front of the spawn door.

144
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,610
In front of the spawn door, right here!

145
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,620
Come on!

146
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Build you piece of shit! Come on!

147
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,920
Quicker! Quicker!

148
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
We did nothing,

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,779
my goodness me.

150
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,779
That was so dumb.

151
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,779
We didn't even build a teleporter or a dispenser.

152
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,779
We didn't do

153
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,019
fucking anything.

154
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,019
We did nothing.
