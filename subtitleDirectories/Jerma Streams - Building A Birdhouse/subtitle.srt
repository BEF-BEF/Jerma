1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:15,029
Hey, sorry I'm late. I had a couple things I had to do that I wasn't aware of until like 45 minutes

2
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:30,730
ago. Let me just get a tweet out there. Hey, a tweet? What a coincidence. Tweeting out a birdhouse

3
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,119
stream. I mean, there's something funny there, I think. Rvem just gave out five community subs.

4
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:47,539
Thank you so much, Rvem. Right off the bat. Didn't even get started yet. I'm making a gaming bird...

5
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,100
Like, this is going to be the worst stream you've ever watched. Hold on. Let me just...

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:27,430
I'll be right back. Give me one second. Okay, so yes, tonight is more proof that all you need

7
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:35,319
to do is just kind of just be the one guy sometimes. Maybe like five or four or five days

8
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:44,819
ago, somebody in the recommended channel just wrote, build a gamer birdhouse. And I was like,

9
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:55,239
that's really dumb. And then I bought a birdhouse kit. And that's where we are right

10
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:04,620
here. That's what we're doing now. One guy. More proof that eventually, if you stick around

11
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:14,500
long enough, you probably be the one guy. And I was thinking about it as I was unpacking

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,099
this thing and just looking at it and taking a look at the directions. This is going to be

13
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:29,050
really bad. This is going to be bad. I just want to make sure right off the bat,

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,879
your expectations are very low. Okay. We're talking like, think about where you could put

15
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:42,219
your expectations. Like a scale of a 10 point scale. Okay. One is... Oh, let's get like

16
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:51,419
this off the screen here. So expectation one at a 10 point scale is a guy turns on a live stream

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,669
and he's asleep with a black screen, right? It's tiny. What do you mean it's tiny?

18
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,169
SheXOXO, thanks for the five community subs. Oh, and I'm already dropping stuff. That's super

19
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:16,250
glue. Don't want to get, don't want to get that on your lips. Hey, here's like the funny

20
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,250
joke for today. I'm going to pretend that this is chapstick at some point. I'm going to

21
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,729
put super glue on my lips and I'm going to go and then everyone's going to laugh.

22
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:35,430
Ripped shirt? No, it's old. This is like a shirt from 1981. Is it ripped shirt or is he

23
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,030
wearing a choker? No, this is a ripped shirt. I'm not wearing a fucking choker.

24
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:09,620
Anyways, let me just get a sip of my delicious fucking tea. Oh, my tooth. That's

25
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,580
good tea. All right, my train of thought. Thank you to the five community subs. Thanks for coming

26
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,779
out. And so here's what we're talking about here. So if you talk about a point scale for

27
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:26,100
for streams, one is guy turns on stream, black screen, sleeping, you just hear him snoring

28
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,100
and that stream is on for 12 hours. Nothing changes. It's just black screen, guy snoring.

29
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:37,060
A two would be cam on guys sleeping and snoring, not just black screen.

30
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:48,360
A three is this stream. That's what you're about to watch. You're about to watch a

31
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,819
tier above the guy sleeping with the webcam on. Let's see what we even got in here. We

32
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,620
have to work with this like nails in here. So I got to be actually careful that I got this.

33
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,079
I could get hurt. Somebody just broke joke incoming. This is the joke. This is it. Like

34
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,040
somebody told somebody to build this on stream. It's gonna be so loud. This fucking

35
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,439
hammer is going to make like loud noises. The neighbors are going to fucking hear me.

36
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:31,800
So let's take a look at the pieces we've got in our fucking bird house.

37
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,250
No, it's too early for that. So this little, this little guy right here,

38
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,410
that's what the bird sits on when he's outside, outside of his house.

39
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:54,259
Let's go over the pieces. So we've got front door, back door. I don't know what these

40
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:06,920
are. Side panels. Okay. Well, this has like a, why is this like a tombstone?

41
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:15,670
This is like a bird tombstone. Okay. This looks like the floor. Where's the roof?

42
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:24,310
Where's the actual roof to this thing? And I got, and paint. It came with four paints.

43
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,629
So I hope you're ready to paint this because you only get to choose between yellow,

44
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:37,079
white, red, or blue. So is this the roof? This comes with instructions,

45
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,560
but should I try to build it without the instructions? Maybe that would be

46
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,740
more fun. I don't think fun, I don't think fun is the right word. Without the instructions,

47
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,339
but I don't know how I'm going to do this. I need the instructions. I need the glue.

48
00:06:50,899 --> 00:07:02,949
All right. No, no instructions. I can fucking do this. All right. So here we go. So it's

49
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,269
going to look, let's, let's just, let's block it out. So we make sure we know what

50
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:15,029
we're doing here. Like this, right? This is a fucking small bird house. What bird is going

51
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:27,459
to fit in here? No bird's going to fit in this. By the way, I don't think there are any birds

52
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:38,649
in Las Vegas. I don't think there are birds here. All right. Let's go. I don't, I'm

53
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,930
using the fucking instructional manual. All right. Sort the pieces, find the hammer,

54
00:07:43,930 --> 00:08:00,550
ask an adult if you need to find a hammer. Are they labeled? Don't use it. Fine. Here you go.

55
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:31,850
Okay. This is, this is the, this is, this is the top. This is the roof because look,

56
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,210
it has to go like that, right? Cause there's, there's that like chain that comes over.

57
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:44,870
So this has to be the roof because there's a chain in here. So this is the floor.

58
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,580
Is that the floor? I don't think that's the floor. I think this is the floor

59
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:09,850
because then, ah, look at that. You guys didn't think I was going to figure it out.

60
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:18,710
Well, this is the floor right here. Here's the floor. How do I, I have to like hammer

61
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:26,679
the nails in here. But which way do those go? So that's the floor. Here are the side panels

62
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,480
like that. That's not the, what about the sides? Are these the sides?

63
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:57,450
Give me the instruction. I don't care. What did I get? I crumpled them all up.

64
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,970
Let me just get the, let me just get the base first and then we can, who cares?

65
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,590
These are the side walls. How the fuck are these the side walls? I had it right. So how, what?

66
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:24,440
So this is the roof. So that's, that's the floor. I had it right the first time.

67
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,019
How are these, how are these the walls? Those are walls. Look at this from this angle.

68
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:42,220
This is, that's not a fucking wall. That's very clearly not going to help.

69
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:59,429
They go on top of the wood. Okay. Wait, what am I doing? I'm doing the first two steps.

70
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:11,850
The floor. What do you mean the floor? Do you like to have them like that?

71
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:34,889
There we go. I have to glue this shit on top of the floor. Wait,

72
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:47,259
I'm going to stop reading this chat room. Okay. Just let me, let me just read this.

73
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:53,940
Select perch B and house front C, which is this these two. Okay. I'm doing it one at a

74
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,100
time place. I can't do it. If I do it in the wrong order, I'm not going to be able to get

75
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,139
it right. And then the, and then the no birds that are in Las Vegas, they're not going to

76
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:08,169
enjoy this. I need a small amount of glue on end of perch and insert small. All right. So

77
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:15,059
I got to glue this thing on. Just, just relax. See, it's got to go right there.

78
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:21,080
I don't even need glue. No birds are going to enjoy this. They'll be, they'll be fine.

79
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,750
So this is the glue. I can't, I'm not going to fucking be stupid. I'm not going to eat

80
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:32,220
this. Although it all, it is tempting though. Frosting, frosting. It's like frosting. It's

81
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:40,460
not frosting, Jeremy. Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Okay. Whoa. Okay. So this is glue.

82
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,500
What kind of glue is this? Oh, that comes up fucking fast. You guys want a good shot of the

83
00:12:45,500 --> 00:13:10,710
glue going on? Perfect amount of glue. Look at that. See? And then that goes in here

84
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:22,149
like this. I don't want to see the glues go out around the edges though. I already

85
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,980
fucked it up. It's already ruined. Look it. It's already ruined. Already I fucked it up.

86
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:34,759
It's already fucked up. I already ruined it. I already fucking ruined it. See? No, don't.

87
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,009
Whatever. Who fucking cares? Okay. Done. Let's take a look at what the next step is.

88
00:13:44,330 --> 00:14:05,860
Place floor on flat surface. This is the floor. What? Like this. Just wipe it. No,

89
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,620
I'm not going to wipe it. Once, okay, I will stop after this and I'll throw the

90
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,580
directions behind me in a fucking fit of rage and you'll think, you'll think it's cute, right?

91
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,659
Okay. On the inside bottom edge, I got to run glue down here and then glue it

92
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:34,600
to here like this. So we've got glue again. Oh, fuck. I need like four people for this.

93
00:14:47,779 --> 00:15:46,759
Okay. So like this and then I have to hammer this in. What happened? Ask your mother for

94
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:56,860
help. I'm going to have like sticky fucking hands. Look at the instructions again. That is the

95
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:14,250
floor. Place floor on flat surface. That's what I did. Take the front. Place against floor edge,

96
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:25,509
matching up nail holes. Don't you understand? I had it done right. Like I did that right.

97
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:35,370
Like this. That was correct. Why is everybody freaking out? That's what I was supposed to

98
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:45,559
do. Because see, look. See? See the holes there? Like something else has to go in there.

99
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:56,230
Because this is the floor. On top? What do you mean on top? Like this? How am I supposed to

100
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:09,430
hammer this in? How am I supposed to hammer this in? I can hammer it in this way. Why do

101
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:24,089
I even need to put the glue there? Just fucking hammer it in. God damn it. Now I don't know

102
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:38,220
where the holes are. He's pretending. Yeah. Yeah. Got you. All right. So then like this

103
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:49,819
and then the nails. Look at that. All right. All right. I don't want a bird to go in this.

104
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:56,200
They're gonna, they're gonna like die from like the glue poisoning. Okay. We're gonna hold it

105
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:07,589
there for 10 seconds. All right. Now I need to hammer the nails in. How am I gonna do that

106
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:17,619
though? Is it? Oh, what? Disgusting. There's a fucking worm in my fucking drink. Don't step on

107
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:31,990
those. You didn't. Whatever. Don't step on that. Watch it. Hey. Watch it. This is fucking

108
00:18:31,990 --> 00:19:03,750
dangerous now. Watch it. I don't think this is possible. All right. I got an idea. What?

109
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:14,309
Okay. So if I just like make it land on the spikes, I'm gonna put a nail through my hand

110
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:22,710
on this stream. I'm taking my fucking time, man. All right. Here we go. Ready?

111
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:54,390
You gotta put. All right. It's in. Now I gotta get the other one. Oh, look. Like coddled,

112
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:01,579
soft hands man. Scared by, scared by fucking hammer and nail. Oh, well,

113
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:14,980
I don't touch those things. That's it, right? That's going in. Let's get it in one hit.

114
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,700
Oh no, don't do that. This is dangerous and you could be, you could get hurt. Don't fucking try

115
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,710
this at home. Uh, yeah. Don't build a bird house at home. That's, they're fucking dangerous guys.

116
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:45,960
Pretty sick. All right. That's good. It's in there. It ain't going anywhere. Nice. All right.

117
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,039
Now we're on the right track. Now I don't need, I don't, I, I know this is the back.

118
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:58,920
So that's going here. How loud? That's probably really fucking loud. Table dented. Where?

119
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:17,369
Right there. Where's the table dented? Right there. Right here. Stop. This table is.

120
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:26,200
All right. Listen to me. This table has seen a lot of work. I've built every labo on these

121
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,599
tables. Uh, that's a lie, but some of them, this was thrown in as a last second in the

122
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,039
moving truck because it was just a random shitty table that I still had that my mother

123
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,359
gave me like 10 years ago. So look, it's going to be fine. Don't worry. This is not

124
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,000
expensive table. This table was like probably four and a half dollars 12 years ago, 20 years ago.

125
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,339
It's an heirloom. No, it's tested. Look, it's tested with the test of time and it can take

126
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:01,640
anything I want. This is my like fuck you table. You know what I mean? Like build a

127
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:19,339
bird house and paint on it. All right. We guys relax. How are these? Wait a minute.

128
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:38,359
Look at how small that is. A bird can't fit in here. This is a wall. If I were a bird,

129
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:45,269
I would throw up in here. I'd get claustrophobic inside of this place. All right. Where are the

130
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:54,279
holes here? There's a hole here. So these two holes are designed to go in. There's holes on

131
00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:04,200
the edges here. So that's like this. Okay. So they'll have to connect that. Let's glue it

132
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:30,069
first. I don't understand what the glue is for if you have nails. Okay. The wasps are going

133
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:41,299
to appreciate this nest. I'm done. I'm done using the glue. Look, okay. Here's the glue

134
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,500
will be the icing on our, it's going to be like a gingerbread house. I'll just put like

135
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,950
icing swirls on it. Fuck this shit. Get this out of here. Don't do, don't get that on the

136
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:59,900
nice desk. Don't put that over here. Don't fuck up this desk. I don't care about this

137
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,740
one. This one, they might look the same guys, but they are not the same. They are very much

138
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:09,579
not the same desk. I'm so paranoid. I dumped a whole coffee on here the other day. All

139
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:21,880
right. That was enough time to load it in. Is this shit blurry? Is this blurry? No, you're

140
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:31,500
good. Basically the same desk. No, it's not the same desk. Well, I'm just realizing

141
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,579
right now where the web with the face cam is. This looks like I'm like fucking huge.

142
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:41,849
I got like a tiny head and a huge fucking arms. Yeah, this looks easy enough for me.

143
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:49,700
It's like a mech suit, the body type of a fucking Megazoid.

144
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:23,369
All right. Uh, nail right in the front, right? Right there. Huh? I'm not using

145
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:28,809
glue anymore. There's no reason to do it. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't fucking do

146
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:38,650
anything. I have to hold this and hammer the nail in. I should have put these on

147
00:25:38,650 --> 00:26:36,329
first. Why did I not do the walls first? Fucking gamer bird house. How can I think

148
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:43,900
of this with physics, right? Cause you know, cause phonetically speaking, I have to

149
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,029
connect these two together, but the, the centrifugal force of the glue is not

150
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:57,779
holding it. So it falls off. So I gotta go like that. Oh yeah. I got it. I got

151
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:02,170
it right. Fucking here. That lined up right? Yeah. Fucking just squeeze it.

152
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:36,119
Just get it. Here we go. Now it's in. Now it's in. Just get it in there. Got it.

153
00:27:39,500 --> 00:28:11,559
Hmm. No, there's a fucking little gap. There's no gap anymore. Get over there.

154
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:52,039
Mother fuck. Am I hitting this into cement or I don't understand. I'm going

155
00:28:52,039 --> 00:29:09,579
to break it. I'm going to break it. It's in. No, it's in. It's in. Oh,

156
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:32,940
look at how red I am. We'll come back to that later. I got to get the other

157
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,099
one in. No, how am I supposed to do this? How are you supposed to

158
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:50,900
actually do this? I gotta think of what color I want to paint my bird house.

159
00:29:50,900 --> 00:30:00,619
Oh my fucking God. And now it's like bent. The nail is bent. I bent the

160
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:07,779
fucking nail. No. All right. It's an extra perch for the bird. You know

161
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:14,630
what I mean? The bird, one daddy bird can go here, right? And then baby bird

162
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:23,880
can go here. And then baby bird too can go over here. I'm like knocking

163
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,849
out other nails. There's no pulling this out. I'm already committed. I've

164
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:36,599
got to just really get this in. This, I've become too completely

165
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,960
committed. But how? I'm gonna need something to wedge this up against

166
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,200
like a wall or something. I'm gonna like push it against, no, but I can't

167
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,930
like, I'm gonna put a hole in the wall. Use the side of the table.

168
00:30:49,930 --> 00:31:08,920
Yeah, but look at it. It's all wiggly. I think that was a glue on my hand.

169
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:20,940
No, that wasn't. I'm just panicking for no reason. Okay.

170
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,660
All right. What's next on this? It's not even written. All right. So now I

171
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:30,950
gotta put the other wall. No, I gotta put the other nail in.

172
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,589
God, this is, are we having fun yet? You know what I mean? We haven't

173
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:47,019
fun yet on this stream. No. No. No. Hey, fucking one guy

174
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:51,369
wanted to do this. Do you understand? That's what we're doing this for.

175
00:31:51,369 --> 00:32:03,640
One fucking guy said, hold on. All right. That wall's on. This feels a little

176
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,980
not secure at all though. All right. You know when you're sitting at a

177
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,019
dinner table and if you put your elbow on it goes

178
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:16,140
and then you have to spend the entire evening trying to not put

179
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,940
enough pressure on the table so you don't knock everybody's food

180
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,059
around and knock everybody's drinks off and shit.

181
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,259
I hate that, man. That's the absolute worst. You know, don't you like hate

182
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,420
like fucking weird shit like that? Do you just hate stuff like that, guys?

183
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:42,900
Relatable. All right. Now other wall. I don't even know if I'm going to get

184
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,980
this correct. It's gonna be, this is gonna be so

185
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:53,400
fucked up. So then this goes, I need it. I need, I don't, the glue is not

186
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,119
gonna, is not doing it for me. Forget about the glue. That's the

187
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,519
decoration on top. I dropped nails on the ground.

188
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,740
Don't, let me forget those. That'll go through my foot in like three

189
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:12,650
days. Don't forget those. Don't forget them.

190
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:22,250
This birdhouse is like such a simple stupid little shit birdhouse.

191
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,529
Yeah, what's the point of the glue? It's just there to make

192
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:30,650
like little, little Timmy think he's like working on something.

193
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,690
Because you bet your ass that's why that's there.

194
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,569
You think them parents are gonna let little Timmy pick up the hammer and

195
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:43,269
fucking hammer this thing? No. That's what dad's for. That's what

196
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm for. You know what I mean? Oh, it's gonna go on the bottom one

197
00:33:47,940 --> 00:34:02,019
first. Get that in there. Okay, same deal as last time. I

198
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,099
gotta, I gotta be careful because it's

199
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:08,630
it's not flush. If it's not flush here, that means it's not gonna be flush up

200
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:22,099
top either though. Fuck you, come on. Get over here. Like this.

201
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:31,079
Get on the edge of the table. Get on there. This doesn't feel right.

202
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:47,260
I don't know what that was. I'm sorry. All right, we're almost done with the

203
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,659
construction. Actually, no we're not. We have a lot of other shit to do

204
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,739
with it. That was cool. I love those muscular

205
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:01,929
items. Hey, thanks. All right, one. Don't, every time I put my thumb

206
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:06,170
here. Okay, I'm gonna like, I'm gonna line it up real quick.

207
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,690
That's how, that's cartoon goofy from fucking the Disney channel. That's how

208
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:29,139
he like hurts his hand every episode. Oh, didn't go in. Uh-oh.

209
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:35,989
No, we're good. Oh, maybe not. I think I may have actually

210
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:44,070
broke it. No, I didn't. We're fine. All right, come on. Don't, don't goofy

211
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,679
this. Do not goofy this. It's in the perfect spot to get

212
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,079
goofy and I don't want to do that. So we're gonna be very gentle, very

213
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:07,579
careful. Okay, now I can move the thumb.

214
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:26,119
It's going like this. Whatever, I don't have to fucking live here.

215
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:35,079
So then hammer it in there. Almost got, it's almost complete.

216
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,199
I can't, this is, it's almost complete for us to go to the top and

217
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,179
just baseball throw it down into the ground and watch it explode.

218
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:53,260
We're not doing that, I'm kidding. Jesus, he's not very smart, is he?

219
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,420
It's a fucking birdhouse. These things, do you think, do you think, do you

220
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,380
think that, do you think that these things are cut correctly?

221
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,659
No, they mass produce 500 fucking million of these

222
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,659
and they're all at random specs. They're not cut correctly. They're not all cut

223
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:16,579
correctly. They, yes they are. It says who?

224
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:27,110
Do you work at Birdhouse Factory for? It's just, it's just some credentials.

225
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:32,329
Oh, you see, I work at the Birdhouse Factory. They're all cut to spec.

226
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:39,780
They're in any room for error in my Birdhouse Factory.

227
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:46,329
How is this gonna stay down here? No, I gotta go through them. No, I have

228
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,969
to go through this one first. I can't go through the bottom

229
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:57,420
because I have to connect it first. Yeah, all right, what side of the

230
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,219
Birdhouse Factory did you guys wake up on today?

231
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:23,690
Fuck! No, it's all right. I thought it was really wrong.

232
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:30,659
Mmm, that's moving a lot. I don't like how that's moving around so much.

233
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:36,920
These pieces of wood are near flawless for a quarter of a penny.

234
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,730
Really? Didn't that sell? Did that sell?

235
00:38:42,730 --> 00:39:07,579
He's the same piece. Would you look at that.

236
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:15,320
Oh, would you, would you look at this? That's not exact, is it?

237
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,289
Oh, listen, it's a little, what happened here?

238
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:45,099
What happened there? Factory? Hmm? What happened here?

239
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,539
Yeah, get fucking, get the Birdhouse Factory exposed.

240
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:58,099
I don't even know where these, where were these plugged in? I don't know.

241
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:02,820
I gotta move this way though. I'm stuck over here. Not in the

242
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,869
Birdhouse. I'm talking about in, in this life.

243
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:12,019
There we go, all right. Of course, Mickey!

244
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:33,800
Whoa! Almost did it, Mickey! Don't fucking do this at your house.

245
00:40:33,800 --> 00:41:06,380
It didn't do anything. Fuck! It's still, the Pinocchio nose is in the

246
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
front. That's why it makes it impossible to do this.

247
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:24,599
And the leg. Oh, I just broke the table! Table broken up!

248
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:50,099
All right, looking pretty good. I'm gonna do the outside first.

249
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,420
I don't know why anybody else feels like this when you're working with

250
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,920
tools, especially with wood and nails. So, this is getting very tight

251
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,539
right now. To a point where I, it's like, oh, I gotta pull it and then

252
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,019
hammer it in. Don't you feel like that the wood's gonna explode?

253
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,769
But isn't that, can't that happen? Can't there be like enough pressure

254
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:10,730
being pulling and pushing and crack, crack, crack, that the thing just

255
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,980
blows the fuck up? I don't want that to happen, so I'm

256
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:38,170
being very careful. This thing's gonna explode. All right,

257
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:44,500
I'm missing a nail somewhere, right? Thank you for reminding me about the

258
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:53,380
nail on the floor. Okay, they're still gonna put the

259
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:01,059
roof on. Oh, shit! There's already a bird in here!

260
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:20,230
He like, found his way in! How does this even, I'm really fucking

261
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:31,940
reaching here, huh? You can see it better that way, right?

262
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:41,179
Oh yeah, I'm very proud of myself right now. This is an accomplishment.

263
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:51,260
You know what I mean? I'm gonna go to sleep tonight and I'm gonna be going,

264
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,099
just having a couple of nightmares, like fucking nightmares, like Jason

265
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,099
the chainsaw, like chainsawing me! And then I'm gonna scream, wake up, and

266
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,739
like go back to bed. And then I'm gonna have like a pretty decent

267
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:15,420
dream about like birds and, you know, I built that. That was fun.

268
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,070
I don't think that's in. It is actually. All right, the general construction is

269
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:25,210
complete. No, it's not. Not yet.

270
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:31,349
Are you stressed out? No, I'm just kidding.

271
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:51,690
Bird lands and the bottom fall. Yeah, all right, so we make like a bird

272
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,250
trap door. The bird lands and like falls out.

273
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,610
And then I'll build a bigger, better house, right?

274
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,730
Connected. It's an, and this thing has cushions and it's got like

275
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,090
cable tv and it's five times as big and they go into that one. And then

276
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,449
this is just kind of the entrance. So then the people don't know

277
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:13,369
what the bird has. I mean, this is like the fake house. Like I just have like

278
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:16,329
four walls and a fucking front door, but they don't know. Like they come

279
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,730
down, the trap door goes whoop, they fall through,

280
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:23,460
and then there's another exit out the back of the tree. So

281
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:37,510
they can have as many nuts in there as they want. Bird tax evasion.

282
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:47,559
I did it. Now I'm just gonna put these two on. Now how the fuck does

283
00:45:47,559 --> 00:46:04,170
this work? Because this little, little slot here,

284
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,619
so it goes like this. Oh wait, hold on, I see.

285
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:16,539
I get it. Do I? Yeah, because the chain goes through there,

286
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:22,900
because this goes like that, because there's the slots on top.

287
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,659
You should really pull your pants up. I'm wearing pants today.

288
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:31,980
I had to. Fuck, no, it goes like this.

289
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:40,730
Because then the chain goes, how the fuck does this work? It goes

290
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,860
like that. How does the chain go in here? The

291
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:54,650
chain has to go up and through there. Like that, because the divot, I don't

292
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:03,579
know if you guys can see. I'm pretty sure it has to go like

293
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:12,329
this. I have no fucking idea, because the

294
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,940
chain has to go through. The chain, see, the chain has to go through. So

295
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,320
you know, it's like that. Got it. Bingo. But this might have to have to

296
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,690
turn around like this, because the chain goes. No, no, I had it

297
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:33,940
right. Bingo. Okay, so like that. So this

298
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:44,250
one's gonna go on first. Oh shit. What? How the fuck does this go on? There's no

299
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:50,440
holes here. I don't have a guide. I don't have any hole guide.

300
00:47:50,440 --> 00:48:02,730
The holes are on the top. I think that's how,

301
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,050
I think this is how it goes, and I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna deal with

302
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:14,679
it. I think. Don't get angry,

303
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:22,780
because there's no, the only holes are on the top here. Nail it with the

304
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:57,929
chain already attached. My neck is too thick for this. Somebody

305
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:12,380
mentioned choker earlier. You can like see this digging into my

306
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:19,320
skin. Hey, uh, what's up? Do you like my new look?

307
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:26,090
It's just like digging into my body. Yeah, I'm gonna do like accessories now.

308
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:32,840
What do you think? Now here's the worst part about this. I

309
00:49:32,840 --> 00:50:01,349
might not be able to get this off. See, it didn't even leave a mark, but

310
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,579
very clearly it did. It's like, it's like a fucking red

311
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:12,519
line. My like neck just drank kool-aid.

312
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,210
Whatever. How do I do this? I'm about to go get

313
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:31,579
alcohol. I don't, I'm done. I don't care. I was hanging. Look, wouldn't it be better?

314
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:34,789
Okay, listen, hear me out. Hear me out, guys.

315
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:39,510
Just wait. Don't you think it would be better if I put like water in here

316
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:45,019
and it looks like a bird hot tub? You know, like a bird bath.

317
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:47,980
Look at how perfect this is. They come in here, they could put their

318
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,860
towel over there, they go right through, they could be in the water,

319
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,780
bird bath, take a bath, come out and leave.

320
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,489
This is not a house. This is a bird. This is a shower. This is a shower that

321
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:07,420
goes in your house. I don't think the seal is good enough

322
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:15,980
though. There's no birds in Vegas. I slowly came to the realization about

323
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,079
this. All right, give me the instructions.

324
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,440
Who ripped them? That's what I want to know. Who ripped them?

325
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,639
Which one of you guys ripped these? Because I wouldn't, I,

326
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:32,250
one of you guys possessed me. I saw like

327
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:40,150
ripped paper and my eyes fucking turned red.

328
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:50,519
Why am I, what am I sitting like? Okay. Oh, it's just the old treasure map.

329
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:53,909
How do we build the old fucking hot tub, mate? All right, so

330
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:57,190
take a side wall piece E and run a thin line of glue on either edge.

331
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,269
That's not where we are. We already did that.

332
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:03,030
Lay roof panel F flat on working surface.

333
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,949
Place roof panel G at a 45 degree angle on top of panel F,

334
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,150
matching edges and nail holes. There's only one way to put these pieces

335
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,469
together. This will ensure proper alignment once you've lined up the

336
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,510
nail holes. Remove roof panel G and run a thin line on the length

337
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:29,829
Okay. Get out of my head. Stop it. Damn it. No. Okay, I'm back.

338
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:36,579
I'm just gonna, I'm just fucking connecting the damn thing like this.

339
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:40,980
There's only one way the thing can go. This is the way it goes.

340
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:46,730
Like that. Nail holes are here. I'm gonna do it off

341
00:52:46,730 --> 00:53:01,050
camera. It's bitter. It's the shoe. It was the goblin. Okay, so here,

342
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,110
like right here. All right, the instructions weren't clear enough for

343
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:18,780
me. Like that. How the fuck am I gonna do this?

344
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:41,000
Do you see how impossible this is? How would a six-year-old do this?

345
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,630
All right, score check. I want a score check of the string. I told you it was

346
00:53:44,630 --> 00:54:01,929
gonna be a three. Four? You can't, Jeremy, you can't

347
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:24,710
hold it and put it down and then hammer it. Why does that hurt?

348
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:34,820
Almost, this is gonna end bad. It's the only way I can do it.

349
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:43,909
Imagine if I missed. I would just hit myself like right in the chest.

350
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:47,829
My stomach is too malleable. It can't, it's not gonna work.

351
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:52,150
I have too much of like a jiggly stomach. I gotta like rock hard abs this.

352
00:54:52,150 --> 00:55:07,579
Why is this not going, it's so loud. I'm sorry. Ready? I'm gonna try to talk over

353
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:11,900
it so it's not so loud. So sorry, it's loud. I'm, I didn't,

354
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:39,380
that's, that wasn't even funny. This is just

355
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,949
Nintendo Labo but dangerous. This is gonna be loud.

356
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,190
I'm gonna meet the mic because you're not gonna want to listen to

357
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:56,389
this. Trust me, you didn't want to hear

358
00:55:56,389 --> 00:56:03,320
that. That's a little fucked up but that's

359
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:16,840
fine. All right, here comes the moment of truth.

360
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:28,730
Don't do it. Don't do that joke. Don't do it. No one's gonna think it's funny.

361
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:56,889
Castlevania, just pretend I did a Belmont thing.

362
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:02,949
Get in there. Get the fuck in there. Get in there.

363
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:13,900
Get it. Oh, get in. Oh, I'm just gonna put it on the ground, okay?

364
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,309
Why do I need to hang this? I'm just gonna put it onto the,

365
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:30,059
on the dirt. Fuck you. How did this even happen?

366
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:34,059
Birds fly? So they can land on the ground. They go to eat the worms in the ground.

367
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:39,320
They can't go in their house. Oh yeah, a squirrel will just go in

368
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,079
there and like take all their stuff. So add a security system, which is what

369
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:56,570
I'm gonna add. Okay, the chain is in. So how the

370
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:03,099
fuck do I do this? I have to connect these two.

371
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:09,860
How the heck am I gonna do that? What the heck is gonna happen? What

372
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:18,440
the heck? Okay, I need the knife.

373
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:31,989
What the heck, man? No, I need to paint this first. Get out of here.

374
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:37,079
Get it out. Get it out of here. This has to be painted

375
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,920
before the chain goes on. There you go. There's your little bird house, guys.

376
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,739
There's the fun little bird house. Okay,

377
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:49,349
now I need, how do I keep this on? Do I have to glue this?

378
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:51,909
All right, so do we want the bird house to have like a Sonic the Hedgehog

379
00:58:53,139 --> 00:59:10,920
or like a visor? Well, balding. I mean, that's like balding or Sonic

380
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,599
because that's too typical. It's got to be like somebody's

381
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:19,219
blowing a hairdryer in the bird house's face.

382
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:22,360
Oh, that's right. That's a lot of shade for the bird.

383
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,130
That's a nice shade there. That's not bad

384
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:35,000
because then they can hang out. But what bird is, I don't know. This is what I

385
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,179
don't understand. The bird is supposed to sit here.

386
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:52,090
What bird is this big? This is a bird. A bird's not this big.

387
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:57,590
Is this a replica? Is this like not supposed to be held anywhere?

388
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,030
This is a bug house. This is going to be filled with fucking

389
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:07,099
cockroaches and beetles in like six months.

390
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:10,139
I'm going to look in there and it's going to be like

391
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,940
that X-Files fucking sound effect is going to play that like weird fucked

392
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:25,260
up violin. I'm going to cause an infestation.

393
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:29,179
Yeah, I know what a bird house looks like but, I mean, lots of birds have

394
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:35,739
nests that are like this big, right? They're like huge. A fucking

395
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:53,260
condor ain't going in there. A hawk ain't going in there. Uh-oh.

396
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:58,940
This is not good. That's not good. Oh, that's not good at all. This is not

397
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:11,429
even going to fit. Oh shit. How did that happen? Oh,

398
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:14,309
that's not good. But during the winter time they're going to get cold.

399
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:17,590
That's raft. All right, I'm just plugging it in.

400
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:23,059
I'm hammering it in. Where are the nails that I dropped?

401
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:39,590
Because I need both of them. Do you see it?

402
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:47,769
I have no idea where they are. All right, this is one.

403
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:55,159
I'm gonna have to glue this because I only have one. Wait, hold on a second.

404
01:01:55,159 --> 01:02:00,440
Did I only drop one? I think I only dropped one, right?

405
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:19,670
Because how does this stay on? That was a disgusting, gross,

406
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,739
under-the-breath burp. Hold on, what are these?

407
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:30,679
What are these? These little hooks? What are those for?

408
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:35,000
Use the glue? But this is the fucking icing.

409
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:46,630
We're going with the shade because I want the bird to have a nice shade.

410
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,489
Let's get the glue on there. I don't want to use that much of this though

411
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:57,619
because I swear to god this is really icing.

412
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:00,500
And then I'm going to paint it. And you'd better believe that we're not

413
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,579
going to spend very much time on that shit.

414
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:16,519
The bird won't fit. Don't put that over there. I gotta think of a good color

415
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:19,159
scheme with the four colors I can choose from.

416
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:26,599
This is important. Yeah, but the bird. Yeah, maybe the bird. But then,

417
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:32,440
look, no, I'm doing the bald head because if a bird can't stand up, if a

418
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,639
bird's this tall, right, then it'll bump its head on

419
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:48,809
the ceiling. We're doing the bald head.

420
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:54,409
Ruined it. How did I ruin it? And there we go.

421
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:58,309
All right, this needs to be hammered a little bit. How can I do this in a

422
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:11,260
way that it's not going to? See? Look at that. It's perfect. What

423
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:18,420
happened up here? It exploded. I told you it was

424
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:33,750
going to. I split the wood. All right, so now it's

425
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,400
time to paint. This is going to be a joy. What about

426
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,980
this last nail? Not an extra nail. All right, let me show

427
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,900
you. Can I show you the utensil that they gave

428
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:51,780
in the box here? The utensil that they gave.

429
01:04:51,780 --> 01:05:01,340
Are you ready for this? Here's how you're supposed to paint the bird house.

430
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,260
It's a fucking carrot brush. What am I supposed to do with this?

431
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:10,260
I'm supposed to paint with this fucking little carrot.

432
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,250
All right, important. Red roof, yellow roof,

433
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:23,099
white roof, blue roof. I ain't gonna, it's gotta, I'm gonna, it's gotta be one color.

434
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:31,579
I think, I think I like blue roof, but that's just me.

435
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:35,099
Because then we get blue and then blue,

436
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:41,750
white, blue, then sonic, and blue, yellow. No, I'm not making a sonic the

437
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:50,659
hedgehog birdhouse. Smart click. All right, fine. You

438
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:53,059
want to play that game? We can play that game.

439
01:05:53,059 --> 01:06:30,250
Enhance it. Here we go. What have I selected here? Hold on.

440
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,530
Wait, I can rip these off, right? No, I can't. We gotta get even closer.

441
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:52,860
Fucking god damn it. Hold on. Okay, you ready?

442
01:06:52,860 --> 01:07:05,690
Go for it. Ah, it looks like blue is, get, don't click my face.

443
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,059
Blue is winning by a lot. Yeah, yeah, I'll click.

444
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:29,139
Fuck! No! He distracted me! Why was, I'm such a total, I'm

445
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:37,289
looking at the, get away from me! Get out of here! I'm

446
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:41,940
not afraid to use it! Don't, I didn't hit myself in the fucking

447
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:49,860
face. All right, it was blue. All right, stop. Stop it. Everybody stop

448
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:58,550
it. Stop. All right, so the color of the

449
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:04,090
fucking roof. Okay, so the color of the roof is

450
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:08,650
gonna be blue. Please select the color. Please

451
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:13,159
select the color of the front panel here, the front.

452
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:24,659
What color is the front going to be? That was

453
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:37,399
blue. Blue? Is it blue or white? This is tough.

454
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:41,880
If only, if only like a massive amount of you guys weren't clicking

455
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:53,109
this spot right here. All right, it's gonna be white.

456
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:56,470
Why am I, I'm gonna hurt myself. Put that down. All right,

457
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:05,479
so we got blue, white. What would you like the back

458
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:10,359
panel to be? Don't vote yet. Back panel.

459
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:21,609
What do you want the back to be? Go ahead. I mean jeez.

460
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:29,350
Blue? Really? That's gonna fuck, that's gonna fuck it all up.

461
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:35,319
Blue? So it's gonna be, so blue up top,

462
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:41,689
blue on the back, white in the front. So then what about this, what about the

463
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:47,779
side panels? Side panels. What are the side, both, they

464
01:09:47,779 --> 01:10:02,010
have to be the same. Side panels. Really, the whole thing

465
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:08,710
is gonna be fucking blue. The whole thing is gonna be blue

466
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:19,100
except for the white. Okay. What would you like

467
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:27,319
the bottom, the base to be? What is the base?

468
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:33,850
Oh, we're getting a little bit of a different story here.

469
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:41,300
Red. This is just gonna be Spider-Man house.

470
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,020
Oh no, it's red shoes for Sonic the fucking Hedgehog.

471
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,539
All right, bottom is red. What about the, most importantly,

472
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:58,310
the little tip. What's the tip gonna be? Sonic does not have a fucking

473
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:14,729
red nose. Yellow? Okay. I think I get what you guys are

474
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:20,279
saying here. So we got blue all around, blue, blue,

475
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:28,979
blue, blue, white in the front, yellow tip, red base. Okay, thank you for,

476
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:37,109
thank you for playing. Let's try to get this back to where it was

477
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:53,220
and begin painting. Fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

478
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:57,109
Okay, so let's get this a little closer.

479
01:11:57,109 --> 01:12:00,310
All right, that's good. So let's begin.

480
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:12,069
So how do I do this reliably? We have to start from the top.

481
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:14,949
No, we can't start from the top. I have to do the bottom first.

482
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:30,539
But how am I gonna, okay, bottom first. Red bottom?

483
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:33,899
Do I have to, are these concentrated orange juices? Do I need water for

484
01:12:33,899 --> 01:13:53,460
this shit? No, I like this cup. Hold on.

485
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:58,100
Okay, so I got something to do this with.

486
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:04,500
I got like a machinimish mixer shot glass. I don't even know

487
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,460
where I, I don't know who this gave this to me.

488
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:16,699
Well, we're gonna use it to fucking dirty our brushes in.

489
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:19,579
I think I got that like, so I don't know why.

490
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:25,109
It was just in the group of glasses. Maybe you got it from machinima.

491
01:14:25,109 --> 01:14:28,630
Probably, whatever. Let's just dirty our

492
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:36,460
brushes in there. All right, so we go with red, right?

493
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:43,529
Like this first? I have not painted in a very long time. Okay, so

494
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:46,489
I gotta be careful here. I gotta do this correct, because if I

495
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:50,260
don't do this correct, then the whole thing goes to hell.

496
01:14:50,260 --> 01:15:18,649
I already started. You don't need water to paint it?

497
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:24,409
Wrong side, what are you talking about? This is the bottom. This is the bottom.

498
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:30,279
The bottom of the device. How could this be the wrong side? It's the

499
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:34,329
bottom. I don't, it's, this is not the top of

500
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:42,300
the birdhouse. You think I'm fucking dumb? I do need water for this.

501
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:52,920
It'll make it spread easier. Like, could they have given me anything

502
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,439
besides like the bridge cleaning dental device?

503
01:15:56,439 --> 01:16:05,510
You know what I mean? Like, oh, I'm gonna clean into my dentures.

504
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:11,899
This is one of those fancy flosses that nobody uses.

505
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:17,430
Am I doing this right? But I can't be done after, I have to like, I have to

506
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:20,409
decorate it. I have to write like sayings on it.

507
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,970
Like, a couple of, I've got a couple of frags. You know what I mean?

508
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:35,859
Because it's a gamer birdhouse. This is already drying.

509
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:42,220
Give me that house. No, this is for the birds.

510
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:47,220
This is not for you. Not for me either.

511
01:16:47,220 --> 01:17:06,250
It's for next week's recycling. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, yeah, birdhouses.

512
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,210
I don't like the way this looks. I need like a brighter light on here. Give me

513
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:13,960
this fucking sun. There we go. Now you guys can see.

514
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,310
Look at how much better that is. You can give me like some tips

515
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:25,399
and some pointers. Get over here. I thought that-

516
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:30,329
Don't drop a fucking expensive light! Why are you like this light?

517
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:36,250
Stop! Oh my god, will you please just fucking stop?

518
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:41,350
There, that's better. I mean, I'm like blowing up my face huge, but

519
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:47,770
this is for you guys to be able to see the the colors here.

520
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:52,300
Was this- what? Hold on. I gotta like change the settings here because this is

521
01:17:52,300 --> 01:18:00,310
blowing me out. That's better. Hey, look at that.

522
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,710
That's better. Now I don't look- well, I don't-

523
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,829
I don't have paint on my hands, right? I already have enough fucking hair

524
01:18:05,829 --> 01:18:16,659
problems. Okay, here we go. So what did that guy-

525
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:20,340
jerma985? Is it j- is it jeremy985? What's-

526
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:24,039
what's his name on Twitch? Yeah, yeah, no, you had it right, man.

527
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:27,619
You watch that guy? Yeah, I mean, I check his stream out every now and then.

528
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,180
Like sometimes he's playing something cool or he's doing something.

529
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,859
I'm like, oh yeah, I'm like a fan. Oh, really? What's he doing now? Oh, dude,

530
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:37,859
probably something really fucking cool. Like, have you never heard of him before?

531
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:40,899
No, never. I did, but what is he- yeah, I'll check him out.

532
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:45,579
Yeah, right now he's uh, he- oh, I just saw what he was doing.

533
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:48,460
Uh, no, you know, man, like uh, you know, let's um, you want to like get in

534
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,939
the lobby and like play Overwatch or something, man?

535
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:53,420
No, no, I'm gonna check this guy out. You're like a fan of him. Yeah, I

536
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,579
want to see what he's doing. Yeah, no, but no, man, like we should

537
01:18:55,579 --> 01:18:58,779
like go- I gotta go though, like uh, hey, just-

538
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:02,550
do you want a free Steam game? Yeah, dude, free Steam game. What are you talking

539
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:05,670
about? Yeah, uh, just pick a game that you want and just like don't open that

540
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:08,390
page, because like I think Twitch is fucking broken or something. Twitch is

541
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:17,670
fucked up. Yeah, man, I'll have to check him out

542
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,229
some other time. Yeah, some other time, like give me- he's live,

543
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:23,750
he's live like sometimes and he's live, he plays uh,

544
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:30,060
he's like, all right though, it's not today,

545
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:37,100
not today, Dan. Look at that, perfect coat of fucking paint.

546
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,140
You know, it almost makes me want to just grab it and fucking smear my

547
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:44,899
hands on it. All right, so now, uh, how do we- how do we wait till

548
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:55,449
this dries? I didn't think this through. I'm gonna do a second coat.

549
01:19:55,449 --> 01:20:09,420
No, I gotta get the edges. This is kind of relaxing. Sometimes-

550
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:13,979
listen, listen to me, okay? Sometimes, you're like, we do a little

551
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:18,920
relaxing, fun little relaxing streams, you know? Not every stream has to be,

552
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,439
you know, something that you share with your friend. Sometimes we're just

553
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:26,039
gonna relax and then build a bird house on stream,

554
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:29,640
right? This is just one of those relaxing streams

555
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,680
that you'd refuse to tell your friends that exists.

556
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:39,979
Why do I have this shirt? It's alf, it's an old alf shirt.

557
01:20:39,979 --> 01:20:44,409
It was a gift. I can't- I thought if I

558
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:49,880
even get one touch of paint on any other place but this is not

559
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:59,779
supposed to be, one push up. Then I'm talking about

560
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:03,140
over the course. If I do it once, it doesn't matter, it doesn't stack.

561
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:16,550
Whoa, dude, one push up. Yeah, one. No, fine, we'll make it 100.

562
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:32,060
Almost done with the base. No, I'm not. Okay, I gotta be very careful

563
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:36,380
because this- oh no, oh no, no, no. How am I gonna get

564
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:45,239
in there? This little bit here. Don't touch it.

565
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:49,159
All right, have we gotten to a point in the world?

566
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,960
Right now, I'm sitting here thinking, man, I have to like do all this shit by

567
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,760
hand. If this was just like a building

568
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,159
video game, I would put my cursor over this and it would go red

569
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:07,060
and I'd be done. I'm just thinking about, man, if I only had like the

570
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:13,210
paint tool and like house flipper or something, this is

571
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:16,869
gonna look really nice when it's done and then you guys can all say that you

572
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:23,449
helped pick out the colors because I made this. No, I did. No, I

573
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:34,659
did. No, I did this. Okay, I need a little bit of water

574
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:41,720
here. How am I gonna switch color? That's why I gotta get it all done

575
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:48,630
in one go, whatever color I'm using. Don't rush it.

576
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,909
This is not a video game. This is one of- this is one of those

577
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:56,949
experiments, guys, where we have to have patience, okay?

578
01:22:56,949 --> 01:23:01,750
Sometimes you gotta bring yourself back to reality. Not everything can be

579
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:25,909
done by opening up a Google Doc. Google Doc painting. Well, you know what

580
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:28,699
I'm saying. Not everything can be done with a

581
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:34,329
fucking Google Doc. You know, back when I was a kid, if we

582
01:23:34,329 --> 01:23:37,859
wanted- if you wanted to like say hello to somebody,

583
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:44,149
you know what our Discord chat was? The living room!

584
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:47,430
And I had to call up on the phone. Hey, what's up, man? You got- all four of us

585
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,829
want to get in the room and play Ninja Turtles?

586
01:23:49,829 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah, it was the living room. The arcade. Yeah, the arcade was awesome.

587
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,739
The crazy thing about the arcade, we're- we're in this- like, hear me out on

588
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:19,050
this, right? So it used to be back when video

589
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:22,649
games were just becoming very, very a popular thing and arcades still

590
01:24:22,649 --> 01:24:25,689
existed. Think about, like, think about the original

591
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:31,770
microtransactions, guys. You used to have to pay like 50

592
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:35,130
cents to play a game. You'd go in and play Mortal

593
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:39,300
Kombat? No, no, that's 50 cents and if you lose,

594
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,340
go fuck and see you later. Give us another 50 cents or you can't play

595
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:53,899
again. What do you think they got the idea?

596
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:58,539
Not wrong. I mean, just think about it. And I would go into that arcade

597
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:02,710
with my allowance and I would spend- I would put 20 dollars in that

598
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:07,819
machine and out would spit for just 20

599
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:10,810
bucks and quarters. And I would spend it all in a

600
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:14,250
couple hours. All right, hold on, I gotta be careful.

601
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:19,029
Make sure there's no bubbles. It's gonna be hard with this little toothpick,

602
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:23,609
though. Yeah, it was an entertainment vending

603
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:25,050
machine. That's a really good way to put it.

604
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:36,439
Okay, now I've got all the edges done. Now,

605
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:45,000
how- how am I gonna do this? I think I can go underneath like this.

606
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,479
All right, this is where I gotta be actually careful because

607
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:53,829
as you see, I gotta get right in this little edge.

608
01:25:53,829 --> 01:26:00,140
But it's okay, I can paint over it later. Play- play Christmas music? It's

609
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:04,119
not- it's not Christmas yet. It's not- it's not

610
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:15,960
Christmas yet. It's all right, I'm gonna paint over it.

611
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:22,949
Not bad, actually. Not bad at all. Spider on the wall.

612
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:32,180
Ah, let me get in a better position here. Spider on the wall. There's a

613
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,939
fucking spider, dude. What are you doing?

614
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:45,210
Stop what you're doing. But yeah, I mean, I remember arcades.

615
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:52,260
Arcades. I was gonna just say something but I forgot what it was.

616
01:26:52,260 --> 01:27:04,869
Can you guys see that? Okay, looking good.

617
01:27:04,869 --> 01:27:08,710
Looking good, Jeremy. Have you been practicing

618
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:11,189
off-stream with a paintbrush to make sure you didn't make a fool out of

619
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:18,409
yourself? No. No, I didn't buy five bird houses and

620
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:22,890
build them all five times to make sure I knew exactly

621
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:29,689
where the pieces went. You know, I'm not like that, guys.

622
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:37,399
I'm a genuine streamer. I wasn't even paying attention and

623
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:43,000
I didn't fuck it up. You know what I

624
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,770
could use right now? A piece of toast. Do I want toast

625
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:55,579
because this is reminding me of toast? These pieces. This is just bread. I'm

626
01:27:55,579 --> 01:28:02,100
trying not to eat bread though. I'm trying to stay the fuck away from it.

627
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,579
Original Doom OST. I'm not putting on fucking do- oh my god.

628
01:28:06,579 --> 01:28:11,079
Do you want to put on Doom for this shit? You want me to put that on?

629
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:14,329
Is that all you guys- do you guys listen to any other- I thought that

630
01:28:14,329 --> 01:28:18,409
was an animal on my camera. I looked over at the

631
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:23,609
OBS preview and I thought this. I thought this was an animal in my

632
01:28:23,609 --> 01:28:34,220
room. Anyways, do you guys listen to any

633
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,630
other songs? It's just, hey I got an idea. Doom

634
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:42,729
OST. Yeah, that's just what's always on repeat.

635
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:55,060
That's what my alarm is. I cook to it.

636
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,939
Although it's kind of like that with a lot of things.

637
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:01,369
Like I can tell you right now there are some songs on YouTube especially

638
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:04,970
where I am absolutely at least 10% of every single play.

639
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:15,000
Absolutely. The little hairs are coming off of this fucking toothbrush.

640
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:23,739
Is the bottom dry enough for me to put this down? I think it is.

641
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:29,850
We got a good coating on it. Filled in all the cracks. Just this last

642
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:35,420
little bit right here. See it? Don't worry, I'm gonna get it.

643
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:49,100
And then we'll put on the Doom OST. How many times have I caved in and

644
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,539
just put on the Doom soundtrack? I wonder how many times that's

645
01:29:52,539 --> 01:30:03,180
actually happened. Doom OST. All right, looks good, huh?

646
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:26,739
Bang. So can, that shit's dry. No it's not, fuck. This is the edges are

647
01:30:26,739 --> 01:30:37,909
like, I gotta spread the edges out. I'm bleeding. I cut myself accidentally

648
01:30:37,909 --> 01:30:41,189
on the, on the wood. That's just, that's not, that's dry.

649
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:50,140
That's just blood. Should be a little more alarming.

650
01:30:50,140 --> 01:31:24,569
Okay, I gotta, I gotta pass out. Don't do that. Okay.

651
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:30,859
Uh, I think it's good. Look, I don't cut all day, okay?

652
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:36,699
It's good. Wash it off in the machinima. Oh yeah baby!

653
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:42,380
Oh, look at that! Oh, I got this cool, awesome new drink idea.

654
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:48,680
Dude, check this out. It's the machinima slammer. Martini, man. Oh, we got,

655
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:58,500
we got triple sec, uh, rum, some watermelon juice. It's the machinima

656
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:04,439
slam. Yeah, you won't do it. I need another

657
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:16,729
color now, right? No way, I'm fine, right? Is this, is this gonna be dirty?

658
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:19,529
Because that's, we're done with the red. I see one little spot right there.

659
01:32:19,529 --> 01:32:24,380
Let me just get it. Should this be in

660
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:30,539
arts and crafts now? Am I in the wrong category? This is just like,

661
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:36,250
I need to be in like, arts and crafts. How do I do that?

662
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:48,840
Arts and crafts. Art. This is not art, though. This is not art.

663
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:53,000
Uh, this is like, this is like offensive.

664
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:02,939
Oh yeah, I'm an art streamer. Look at me go like I'm painting a bird house.

665
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:09,189
Uh, crea- creative? There's no, creative? Destruction.

666
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:18,600
Go under body painting. I'm not gonna go under body painting.

667
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:29,750
Crafting? I just, uh, I don't, uh, what about like bird houses? Is there a

668
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:37,449
bird house category? God damn it. I just have to go into

669
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:41,829
art. And, okay, how about building a bird

670
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:44,869
house in parentheses. Don't watch this stream. It's not,

671
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:47,829
don't watch it. Don't tell your friends about it. No, that's like a

672
01:33:47,829 --> 01:33:57,340
reverse psychology. Like, oh don't watch this, man.

673
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:02,739
Whatever, building a bird house. I was in just chatting before, but what's

674
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:10,539
like just chatting building a bird house?

675
01:34:10,539 --> 01:34:14,300
All right, here we go. I did not forget about the Doom OST.

676
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:42,489
I can't fucking believe I'm putting this on. Give me a second.

677
01:34:42,489 --> 01:35:44,329
Don't drink that! Welcome to the fucking Satan stream.

678
01:35:44,329 --> 01:35:50,470
Whoa! Why have I made it a plastic? I swear to God I don't look like

679
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:56,569
this. I don't look like this. That's so

680
01:35:56,569 --> 01:35:58,409
strange. I, this is something to do with the

681
01:35:58,409 --> 01:36:02,729
lighting, I can promise you. I'm not like greasy. This is, I didn't

682
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:09,579
just paint my face. I just painted my face. That's what I did.

683
01:36:09,579 --> 01:36:30,340
I painted my face red. I can't even see. I need to do paint.

684
01:36:30,340 --> 01:37:52,279
Hold on, just hold on a minute. I'll be right back. Dude, it fucking stinks in

685
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:56,920
this room. I don't know why. It smells like old,

686
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:04,680
old like rubber mats. I don't understand why that is.

687
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,979
All right, back to, back to our Doom bird house.

688
01:38:08,979 --> 01:38:13,899
So it was all blue, right? Blue everywhere on all the sides,

689
01:38:13,899 --> 01:38:21,850
down the back, right? Or should we just do fucking

690
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:28,020
red? All right, let me close red. We don't need it anymore.

691
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:39,130
Give us the old boom. The old Doom. Doom, you know, I'm not doing all red.

692
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:44,859
We already voted on it. All blue up top. I can't fucking see

693
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:47,340
though. This is hard to see what, I can't

694
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:53,510
read this. This is the, it doesn't, it's messing with my brain. It's the

695
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:59,000
wrong color. See, you guys, we can't, that looks like

696
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,289
black. I'm gonna change the, the screen back to normal in a minute here.

697
01:39:05,289 --> 01:39:26,699
That's right. We'll build a fucking bird house. I need more than that. I gotta

698
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:30,710
get like a lot on there. Not doing more than one coat. Just

699
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:34,819
get it on there. This actually is kind of working like

700
01:39:34,819 --> 01:39:40,659
a black light, so I can see exactly where I haven't painted.

701
01:39:40,659 --> 01:39:51,909
You want to put on the boom Doom? Boomer Doom?

702
01:39:51,909 --> 01:39:56,069
Yes, I'll put on Boomer Doom in a little bit. Let me get one panel with

703
01:39:56,069 --> 01:40:00,899
the original Doom new boom soundtrack.

704
01:40:00,899 --> 01:40:08,539
The new boom, you know what I mean? It's all right if that's,

705
01:40:08,539 --> 01:40:11,899
I got, I splattered it a little bit. What if we did like a cool thing where

706
01:40:11,899 --> 01:40:16,100
it was like, never mind, shut the fuck up Jeremy.

707
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:31,159
Whoa. I say anybody that comes in from like the art

708
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:35,939
category, just, we need to just tell them that I did all this by hand.

709
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:40,300
Like I, I crafted the wood myself. I like cut it, I like did it with my

710
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:50,710
bare hands. When this is done, I know a lot of

711
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:54,069
people might be taking a little bit of jokes and talking shit,

712
01:40:54,069 --> 01:41:00,420
but you are going to wish you had this birdhouse when it's done.

713
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:05,720
Which won't be very long from now. All right, this is, okay,

714
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:10,039
can I stop the boom joke? The Doom joke? All right, hold on.

715
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:12,199
I'm gonna like move out of the way so I can make sure I, because I need

716
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:22,569
to see it from afar so I can make sure the lights are correct.

717
01:41:22,569 --> 01:41:39,500
There we go. Hey. Now we can actually see what we're doing.

718
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:52,279
It's purple, but we're on Twitch who gives a shit. That's my excuse.

719
01:41:52,279 --> 01:42:07,050
So original Doom. Original Doom OST. Okay.

720
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:14,979
This is from, this is the original Doom soundtrack. I'm gonna put it low in the

721
01:42:14,979 --> 01:42:16,979
background because I don't want it to be, I don't want it to take over the

722
01:42:16,979 --> 01:42:27,500
stream. Not like it matters. What, what happened

723
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:35,590
here? Why is it yellow? Sonic the Boom House. Sonic the

724
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:41,270
Birdhouse. Sonic the Boom House. You guys got me

725
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:44,390
saying boom and boomer and shit. I don't know

726
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:58,699
who came up with that. Some television show.

727
01:42:58,699 --> 01:43:30,939
Of course, bring it, we contribute it back to TV shows.

728
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:38,020
Someone just says stop. Stop doing what you're doing, Ralph, please.

729
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:48,250
I got, I don't need any more paint than this. This is a little too much.

730
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:52,250
This is a cute little bird house. Don't you think so?

731
01:43:52,250 --> 01:44:27,800
What's wrong with you guys? Calm down. I feel like I've been doing the

732
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:47,560
same motion for five minutes straight. Fucking just move on already, man.

733
01:44:47,560 --> 01:45:00,140
Squirreling in the holes. Look, it is perfect. It is perfect.

734
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:04,729
Ohhhh. I'm not doing it again, don't worry.

735
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:08,329
I had at least a thousand people just fucking clicked mute wicked fast right

736
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:18,149
there. Somebody was, I had a sandwich and

737
01:45:18,149 --> 01:45:21,510
they like fucking dropped this shit. Fucking, god damn it, dude.

738
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:27,960
Jeremy, what the fuck? Like a food all over the floor. Right now they're

739
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:35,859
cleaning that all up and it's my fault. And it is.

740
01:45:35,859 --> 01:45:38,500
Somebody's on their hands and knees right now because they dropped like a

741
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,140
fucking bowl of macaroni and cheese on the ground

742
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:50,890
because they thought I was gonna be really loud again. Okay, this is turning

743
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:55,050
into more of a Super Mario house than it is a Sonic the Hedgehog house.

744
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:59,739
I'm gonna have to finish it up by drawing his face on the front.

745
01:45:59,739 --> 01:46:06,340
Right? All right, that looks good. We're completely coated on the front.

746
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:15,750
Same thing on this side. Just get a little bit of water on there to

747
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:21,050
loosen it up. You know, you know what I could

748
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:27,960
really go for right now? I should have a slammer. Triple

749
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:41,850
sack, rum, watermelon puree. I'm really craving one right now. I

750
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,090
could probably do this better with my hands

751
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:50,779
but I'm not going to because then what do I do with my hands? What am I supposed

752
01:46:50,779 --> 01:47:01,670
to do with the hands after that? Paint. I'm okay, so if I if I dunk my

753
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:05,850
hand in here and smear it all over there and do it in five seconds.

754
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:09,689
Okay, that's great. Then what am I supposed to do with my hands?

755
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:12,810
I can't leave the room. I would have to sit here until

756
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:20,119
so I would have to scream for help. I'm gonna grab the doorknob with

757
01:47:20,119 --> 01:47:25,460
paint all over my hands. Wipe it all over my nice shirt, you know?

758
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:33,800
Like, all you guys that are talking shit right now about this shirt.

759
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,560
Keep in mind I put this shirt on because it's like a shitty shirt

760
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,439
and if I got paint on it I wouldn't be it wouldn't be the end of the

761
01:47:40,439 --> 01:47:43,159
world. When you paint you wear painting

762
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:44,920
clothes that you know you don't care about.

763
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,880
But I care a lot about this shirt. This is like a this was a gift

764
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,159
from my mother and it means a fucking lot to me.

765
01:47:51,159 --> 01:47:54,279
So I'm not getting paint on it. She gave it to me a long time ago and

766
01:47:54,279 --> 01:48:02,729
it's a really great fucking gift and I don't want to ruin it.

767
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:06,649
So was the table. But do you understand I-

768
01:48:06,649 --> 01:48:21,529
No. Don't go that far. Your shirt is amazing, sweetie. Thanks, Mom.

769
01:48:21,529 --> 01:48:26,710
Thanks a lot, Mom. I appreciate it. We're running

770
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:30,260
running out of blue paint just to let you guys know.

771
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:45,609
We're getting down to the bottom. God, oddly satisfying.

772
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:49,619
Like, yeah. Watching him paint that. Oddly.

773
01:48:49,619 --> 01:49:00,899
You know what I'm saying? There's a dev in the chat? Dude, love your bird houses, man.

774
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:05,859
Can you uh confirm for the for the viewers here? First of all, yeah I mean

775
01:49:05,859 --> 01:49:10,600
I think the release went really well. But can you confirm? Just I just was

776
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:13,560
curious is is there something about the in the factory

777
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,920
the way that they cut the pieces? Because some of the pieces weren't

778
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,119
matched up correctly but I mean but you can't- Come on. It's day one. Bugs.

779
01:49:20,119 --> 01:49:29,449
You can't get over bugs on day one. So I understand but is it

780
01:49:29,449 --> 01:49:31,770
going to be- Yeah. Day one bug. Like there was a

781
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:34,010
bug in here when I put it up on the first day.

782
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:40,500
Because I've had bird houses from the same company before. But there I

783
01:49:40,579 --> 01:49:45,859
mean it's still a problem I think. All right so this is almost done here

784
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:50,920
and then we can do some finesse work. And then I'm gonna add the icing. I don't

785
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,159
give a shit if this is supposed to be a Sonic the Hedgehog house. He's

786
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:56,899
getting icing all over his head. What am I- What else am I supposed to

787
01:49:56,899 --> 01:50:06,819
do with the glue? This is Christmas Sonic the Hedgehog.

788
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:11,189
I gotta really thin this out. The blue is going away.

789
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,829
I don't have very much and I have to do the whole rest of the house.

790
01:50:13,829 --> 01:50:18,380
Any art people in here that know how to do that? How do I like make this

791
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:30,460
go further? Can I put like olive oil in there?

792
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:34,920
Paint thinner. Easier said than done when you- This wood

793
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:39,960
eats it up. It drinks it up man. Yeah something about- Your walls are just

794
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,140
drinking up the paint. That's why it's gonna take us a couple more days.

795
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:48,819
Yeah we put a coat on and your walls just fucking drank the thing up.

796
01:50:48,819 --> 01:50:51,380
You know? We're gonna give us like four more coats.

797
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:55,220
It'll be like $425. It's not a big deal but you know your walls man

798
01:50:55,220 --> 01:51:05,739
they just fucking drink it up. All right it looks good. Pretty decent.

799
01:51:05,739 --> 01:51:10,539
Now that we have- We're missing a little bit down here.

800
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:22,010
Paint- Put less on your brush at a time. That's a good idea!

801
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:28,460
But you see what I'm saying? Look at the edge here. I mean your fucking walls

802
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:39,220
just fucking drink it up though. All right that looks fine. Let's see if

803
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:55,260
we can get away with this. Not getting away with it. This is

804
01:51:55,260 --> 01:52:05,000
the hard part because this is where the little divots are.

805
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:10,329
Shit! I gotta go underneath. Can I- Can underneath be white?

806
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:16,899
Guys, do you care about that if underneath is white?

807
01:52:16,899 --> 01:52:21,300
No. No it can't be. Why? Why can't I have the underneath be white?

808
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:35,699
Because it's Sonic but whatever. Doesn't Sonic have like white

809
01:52:35,699 --> 01:52:42,119
frosted tips or is that his like- No that's his like weird cousin right?

810
01:52:42,119 --> 01:52:51,739
Who's the Sonic the Hedgehog with the frosted tips? There really is one.

811
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:59,609
Silver. Silver the time traveling hedgehog right?

812
01:52:59,609 --> 01:53:03,449
He went over real well. Didn't see him in another fucking game.

813
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:10,060
All right. Why didn't everybody tell me that I was dripping? I can use

814
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:15,750
that later though. I have to wait till this dries to do that part.

815
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:26,489
The front is white. All right. We let- This is going a little bit further than

816
01:53:26,489 --> 01:53:33,340
I thought on the edge here because this is a smooth edge.

817
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:37,800
Looking kind of good. Looking kind of good.

818
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:48,250
Looks good. It worked. Now I'm just going to do that on all sides.

819
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:51,449
Thankfully the blue is gone after this. I have plenty of yellow too. Can I

820
01:53:51,449 --> 01:53:54,409
just make his whole body yellow? You guys are not really going to

821
01:53:54,409 --> 01:54:00,140
care that much. No one is going to care that much if

822
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:14,520
his body is fucking yellow. No no no no. All right my god.

823
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:19,350
And why do I care? Like the bird that's going to live in this house

824
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:22,310
is not going to worry about if his house looks like Sonic the Hedgehog.

825
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:26,119
I didn't know what that is. He's a bird.

826
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:29,479
Birds don't play video games no matter what Falco

827
01:54:29,479 --> 01:54:45,029
tries to tell you. It's Falco's house. No it's not Falco. Well it could be.

828
01:54:45,029 --> 01:54:48,390
Guys are you starting to realize that every fucking video game character is

829
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:50,789
the same color scheme? Are you figuring this out yet?

830
01:54:50,789 --> 01:54:55,500
Think of a video game character right now in your head. Are they

831
01:54:55,500 --> 01:55:10,380
are they red and blue? Yes they are. No no uh Doomguy. Doomguy is red and blue.

832
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:15,020
Look it up. Somebody said Link. Uh the the the game with on the DS with the

833
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:20,300
four of the links and the one was blue and red.

834
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:43,640
Metroid. Samus is blue and red. Pac-Man is yellow. Donkey Kong. His tie

835
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:47,560
is blue and red. Red tie with a blue

836
01:55:47,560 --> 01:56:03,460
decay on it. Oh I'm almost out of fucking paint.

837
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:10,170
Oh this has got I gotta make this go longer.

838
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:15,260
Captain America. Blue and red. Spider-Man.

839
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:20,069
Blue and red. Thor. Blue and red. Iron Man.

840
01:56:20,069 --> 01:56:39,000
Red with a little bit of blue and a small by orange for his eyes.

841
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,359
Heinz tomato ketchup. The weird blue bottle.

842
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:45,479
And it's red. And they did a blue they did a blue version of it too. Remember

843
01:56:45,479 --> 01:57:05,130
the gross blue one that nobody wanted? Blue and red. What the fuck was that

844
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:11,739
noise? German 985. Well you're probably thinking

845
01:57:11,739 --> 01:57:18,409
German your colors are not oh wait they're blue and red.

846
01:57:18,409 --> 01:57:21,449
They're like teal and they're like a version of that.

847
01:57:21,449 --> 01:57:34,729
Okay it looks good. Did I get some on me? No. All right we're

848
01:57:34,729 --> 01:57:38,630
getting to the point where I need to I still have blue. I still need to do

849
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:41,270
blue. Just gotta do the back. Wait hold

850
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:45,850
on wait wait wait wait. Only the front is white right? Front is

851
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:50,180
white the sides are blue the back is blue.

852
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:55,659
Is that correct? Right he's right okay right right right.

853
01:57:55,659 --> 01:58:12,699
I need to spread this out a lot because I did a heavy heavy-handed

854
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:20,460
coats on the top. And this children's toy only gives you

855
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:37,770
two teaspoons of paint. There we go nice and liquidy.

856
01:58:37,770 --> 01:59:00,060
Who is white? Yeah white's in the front while blue's in the back.

857
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:13,210
It's not a big deal like I didn't just get what the fuck is wrong with me.

858
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:20,229
I can fix it later. That was a horrible jump scare in a horror game.

859
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:49,939
No I painted blue on the red. Whatever will I do? Okay I think I might

860
01:59:49,939 --> 02:00:00,170
have just enough just barely. Gonna get underneath here. Good thing

861
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:03,260
the whole thing is blue. You guys really didn't make it that

862
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:06,649
hard for me. If you guys had made the sides yellow

863
02:00:06,649 --> 02:00:09,930
the top blue the corner red you guys really just said

864
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:17,029
blue house. Do whole house blue. Made it pretty easy for me. Thanks guys I

865
02:00:17,029 --> 02:00:25,300
appreciate it. Pay up with those push-ups baby arms.

866
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:31,460
What did I say I was gonna do one? I can't put this down.

867
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:40,060
Don't you realize this? I cannot put this down. You're gonna have to wait

868
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:51,670
a minute. Just remember that. They won't. Now

869
02:00:51,670 --> 02:01:07,270
is the top dry? Not really. Gotta spread that shit out man.

870
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:17,050
This blue paint fucking everywhere. Thanks mom for the fucking desk.

871
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:41,560
I have to put this down. All right now I gotta do. I can't hold it.

872
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:48,100
I didn't think this through at all. Get out of the way machinima.

873
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:58,789
That table is now fucked up. No it's a memory that I'll never

874
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:05,189
I'll never lose. I always remember the day that we all built a birdhouse

875
02:02:05,189 --> 02:02:12,409
together. You know what I mean? Remember the

876
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:14,970
time that he built a birdhouse and we were all there screaming and

877
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:29,989
cheering him on. You got to the finish line. I'm just

878
02:02:29,989 --> 02:02:32,869
okay I gotta just pick it up. Just get just rip off the band-aid. Pick

879
02:02:32,869 --> 02:02:55,430
the fucking thing up. I'm out of fucking paint.

880
02:02:55,430 --> 02:03:02,300
Why wouldn't they give me like triple the amount that's in here? Who made this?

881
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:06,489
I did. I made this. Me. I did. I did this. Me. I did this.

882
02:03:06,489 --> 02:03:31,560
Me. I did this. Change the OST. Hold on. I just gotta fill it in

883
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,699
good enough. It's a whole other side that I have to do and I don't have

884
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:39,289
any more blue. We're gonna have to desperate times call for desperate

885
02:03:39,289 --> 02:03:50,789
measures because this is not going to work anymore like this.

886
02:03:50,789 --> 02:04:26,979
Thing is fucking empty. Blue. Everything has to be blue.

887
02:04:26,979 --> 02:04:41,880
I'm on the desk right? All right okay good. The top is so good

888
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:48,699
and the fucking god damn it. Mix the other colors.

889
02:04:48,699 --> 02:04:58,729
I can't make blue with yellow and red? I can't make blue with white and

890
02:04:58,729 --> 02:05:05,479
yellow. How do you make blue? Go buy more

891
02:05:05,479 --> 02:05:10,010
paint. Use a blue marker. I don't think I even have a blue

892
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:13,210
marker. No. I can I can work with this. Just

893
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:37,699
wait. This soundtrack sounds like shit by the way.

894
02:05:37,779 --> 02:05:43,779
I can't. It's not my headphones aren't in but all I can hear is like

895
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:59,270
and I'm does that that must sound fucking terrible.

896
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:10,119
Almost. And then we just deal with the consequences.

897
02:06:10,119 --> 02:06:16,729
Oh I got it. It's over man. I got it. I'm gonna be good to go. What? That

898
02:06:16,729 --> 02:06:26,039
was so unnecessary. Just put just add water and then swirl

899
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:31,220
it up and that's perfect. We're good. I can touch up

900
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:42,500
Bullshit later. Just want to make sure it's coated. Look at that. Doesn't that make you feel fucking great?

901
02:06:43,060 --> 02:07:08,260
Okay, is a robot singing right now? I can't tell. Is there lyrics to this song? No. Okay, dude

902
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:13,680
Oh, man, you know what I'm craving right now? The new fucking drip from machinima

903
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:19,699
Bacardi 151 top it off with a little bit of rum chata underneath that a

904
02:07:20,279 --> 02:07:24,960
layer of fucking orange juice and then blue food coloring

905
02:07:25,319 --> 02:08:02,170
All right, almost done. See we stretched it out. We stretched it out guys. We made it

906
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:21,579
We stretched it out and we did it prices averted nice and blue just have to take care of the edges, but that's fine

907
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:32,449
The touch-up work can come later because I'm gonna use the white to do little touch-ups and I did not think in a fucking trillion years

908
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:37,960
That the birdhouse stream was gonna be more than two hours

909
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:43,170
not in a fucking

910
02:08:43,449 --> 02:08:49,060
Million years I would have taken the bet last night if you said this was gonna take 15 minutes

911
02:08:49,500 --> 02:09:01,739
Nah, dude, that's gonna take like 15 fucking minutes

912
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:13,060
Alright good gotta get the underside here. What do we really even need to? Oh

913
02:09:13,779 --> 02:09:16,520
Fuck you, Jeremy. You touched it and it's ruined now

914
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:20,619
How am I ever gonna win the fucking birdhouse contest?

915
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:46,250
Just gotta get a little bit here and then the blue is done and I can finally it's empty empty empty

916
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:59,760
Actually empty actually literally physically literally physically fucking actually empty, you know, this is a pretty good Splatoon song

917
02:10:00,199 --> 02:10:15,489
What's wrong the roof? What's wrong with the roof? The roof is a design choice

918
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:18,920
No, well, it's the reverse of the design choice

919
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:33,699
That looks a lot cleaner. So we're supposed to be shade for the bird

920
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:41,000
But we ran into a little problem where looked so cool if it was wind blowing against the house's hair

921
02:10:41,819 --> 02:10:46,300
So we just said cool man. We decided to do that instead

922
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:52,979
Needs to be a thicker amount of paint here. And then we move on to the white

923
02:10:52,979 --> 02:11:00,569
I'm gonna take the nub out that looks like shit

924
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:07,979
I'm not happy with that at all. It's this goddamn art, man. It's got to be the way that I want it

925
02:11:08,199 --> 02:11:27,779
It looks fucking horrible back here

926
02:11:28,039 --> 02:11:36,170
What what like fucking pizza delivery music is this is this actually doom?

927
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:52,520
Okay done

928
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,520
All sides are done

929
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:59,470
Blue blue, it's not perfect over here

930
02:11:59,989 --> 02:12:23,949
See that you see look at the faint done. There it is. Now we just need to I need to wash my fucking hands

931
02:12:23,949 --> 02:12:31,569
I can't see this the problem that I knew was gonna happen. Why didn't you why did you let me do this?

932
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:34,010
Why did you guys let me do this? Because now I can't leave the room

933
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:39,000
I can't touch anything over here because I don't get paint on my fucking mouse

934
02:12:39,600 --> 02:15:17,279
Beck, okay clothes this weight. This is paint all over this. I'm not touching that ever again

935
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:27,800
Just open the white. All right front. This is this still is drying so I can't really touch it

936
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:39,649
Is there an OST still playing? Don't touch your mouse. You're fine. Okay, what other OST something like relaxing?

937
02:15:39,649 --> 02:15:43,550
Something we could just chill to

938
02:15:43,909 --> 02:15:45,590
Sonic OST

939
02:15:45,590 --> 02:16:22,050
Sonic Mania complete soundtrack playing. Okay, Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic Mania OST

940
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:30,380
Sonic Heroes OST guys, it's so hard to decipher because this take 400 Sonic games

941
02:16:30,859 --> 02:16:43,069
Okay, I have to hold it by this thing right there

942
02:16:43,069 --> 02:17:30,799
I gotta use a lot because it's not showing up. This just looks like glue

943
02:17:31,399 --> 02:17:50,870
Paste this looks so fucking bad. What's with this color opacity here? What's with the pigment? This pigment sucks

944
02:17:51,409 --> 02:17:55,750
Dump the whole thing on there. No, cuz then it'll never dry

945
02:17:56,350 --> 02:18:15,489
How am I ever supposed to draw Sonic the Hedgehog's fucking shitty face on here? I'm so mad right now

946
02:18:15,610 --> 02:18:27,680
This was looking kind of good and now the white paint just ruined it doesn't even show up through the wood

947
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:30,239
I'm gonna have to do like five coats

948
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:39,270
Mix it in the glue

949
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:41,790
But I need this for the adult not not yet. That's

950
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:57,479
This is absolute last resort. This needs to dry and then we can figure out a fucking absolute last resort plan

951
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:07,200
If it doesn't work, how come all the other paints were so good, but this one was terrible

952
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:13,860
This is not even trying to be paint. I actually I'm pretty certain. This is not even his paint. This is not even paint

953
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:20,270
Absolutely not paint

954
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:29,069
Fucking bullshit. This looks terrible. Why haven't put this color in here, you know me why do what what instead of white?

955
02:19:29,069 --> 02:19:31,069
why don't give like orange or

956
02:19:31,629 --> 02:19:36,590
Brown or green whiz green you put up not a white that just doesn't work

957
02:19:36,590 --> 02:19:56,879
I need layers, but I don't have enough to do that many layers

958
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:05,799
I really should just put fucking frosting on here. That's what it looks like

959
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:39,049
Are you fucking kidding me? It is frosting. What color is Sonic's eyes? Look at this up close

960
02:20:39,569 --> 02:20:44,500
That's not even that's just powder

961
02:20:45,459 --> 02:21:00,159
Baking soda on the front of this thing. I guess we could do the nose and then paint over it again

962
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:13,319
It's got to dry and then we'll do it again. Alright, so let me do some let me do some little bit

963
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:15,920
Alright, so this now that I have a minute here

964
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:18,370
Let's do the icing

965
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:23,959
Because this is this is done up top here. So what do you think like or horizontal?

966
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:25,819
vertical

967
02:21:25,819 --> 02:21:39,870
What do you guys think? I would say probably horizontal like this just a little bit because it's so it's festive

968
02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:42,469
What do you mean? Those are the spikes. That's spikes

969
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:46,700
How have you not figured this out yet? I gotta go like spikes

970
02:21:47,379 --> 02:21:48,579
spikes

971
02:21:48,579 --> 02:22:06,180
Don't ruin it. Oh, yeah, don't ruin it. Don't ruin this fucking great piece of work here

972
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:12,760
But don't ruin it

973
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:14,959
Hey, why was I saying? Hey

974
02:22:14,959 --> 02:22:20,709
Hey, oops, that was I accidentally just turned off from Sonic the Hedgehog

975
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:26,940
Sonic was it Sonic Heroes you wanted Sonic Heroes

976
02:22:27,719 --> 02:22:57,459
Ost. All right. I gotta dry this quicker. I fucked it up. I was gonna sing it, but I can't hear it

977
02:22:57,459 --> 02:22:59,459
I was gonna lip-sync it

978
02:22:59,579 --> 02:23:10,569
Whatever. All right, let's try another

979
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:19,600
I'm gonna see if I could fit something in there afterwards

980
02:23:26,229 --> 02:23:30,629
Sharpie have a sharpie that'll do that

981
02:23:31,809 --> 02:23:33,530
Let's try another coat

982
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:37,790
No, it just clumps up. You can't even see it

983
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:52,739
Whatever it Sonic's face is a little patchy, right? He's gonna have like a fucking goatee. Anyways, this Sonic has like a big goatee, right?

984
02:23:53,379 --> 02:23:58,629
He is an animal. He is a hedgehog. Why would he not have a fur there? This is fur. That's perfect

985
02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:00,629
Okay, that's fine. I'm okay with this

986
02:24:00,829 --> 02:24:11,600
It's not gonna get any better than this. I mean the stream by the way fucking goddamn it

987
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:30,520
This really doesn't do anything. Okay, I'm gonna have to it's time for glue

988
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I'm gonna see what it looks like. I'll try it in one spot

989
02:24:42,469 --> 02:24:47,659
Doesn't seem to be helping much

990
02:24:47,659 --> 02:24:59,270
But here's the what I'm gonna do with the glue. I'm gonna draw his face with the glue

991
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:07,590
That's right because I'm gonna mix in some blue into this bottle. I'm gonna shake it up and I'm gonna draw his face

992
02:25:08,149 --> 02:25:18,709
This actually is working somehow

993
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:23,829
It's almost forcing the paint to clump together. So it makes a an actual patch

994
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:31,129
Like don't you remember that you guys have seen the videos where the guys make the pancake art

995
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:33,129
It's gonna be like that

996
02:25:33,129 --> 02:25:35,129
except just forget about the pancake part

997
02:25:38,489 --> 02:25:42,409
figure out what was wrong by the way, everybody everybody's gonna freak out but I

998
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:49,899
I should have painted the whole thing red and then I would have painted over the paint white

999
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:07,190
White over because look what's happening with it. Look look down here. See how this is actually coming up

1000
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:09,270
It's coming up white

1001
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:11,590
Rather than this weird fucking puke

1002
02:26:12,469 --> 02:26:16,520
I can't even say it

1003
02:26:27,379 --> 02:26:30,819
Started over and no, I want to get to the design. That's the best part

1004
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:35,530
So I need to put

1005
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:36,729
blue

1006
02:26:36,729 --> 02:26:41,110
Like I need a picture of son. Okay, turn the shitty fucking music off. It's not shitty. It's okay

1007
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:44,709
For like a 2003 game. All right, um sonic

1008
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:46,549
sonic

1009
02:26:46,549 --> 02:26:48,940
What does he look like?

1010
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:52,649
What does sonic look like?

1011
02:26:52,649 --> 02:26:54,260
All right. It's

1012
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:59,000
You guys made me do this all wrong. Why did you make me do it like this?

1013
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:14,600
I it needs to be blue down to here eyes and then it's a yellow here. All right, so I need yellow

1014
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,340
Might as well paint the stick here

1015
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,059
We're so sorry

1016
02:27:23,059 --> 02:27:27,850
Don't be sorry. I'm just kidding. All right, white doesn't matter because it doesn't stick to anything. So

1017
02:27:28,489 --> 02:27:30,489
We just need to paint this thing yellow

1018
02:27:39,379 --> 02:27:56,260
This one sucks too

1019
02:27:56,260 --> 02:28:03,850
Whatever. All right. Look at that. Would you look at that? It's almost completely done

1020
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,180
Just got here. How shit faced is jerma?

1021
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:13,260
I mean not really I had um, i've only i've been drinking these machinima drinks

1022
02:28:14,219 --> 02:28:18,219
Like the latest one

1023
02:28:18,219 --> 02:28:20,219
the fucking moo machine

1024
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:24,059
This is vodka cream

1025
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:33,059
Heavy cream that is and then two droplets a fucking hot sauce

1026
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:51,239
It's called the crazy fucking cow from machinima. All right, i'm done with this and we're gonna put the chain on

1027
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:59,020
And i'm gonna hang it

1028
02:28:59,020 --> 02:29:00,860
You won't be able to see the hanging

1029
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:02,860
Because that's not gonna all right. Well, there we go

1030
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:06,860
I gotta fix the red down there

1031
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:09,340
Do the face the face is gonna be very very much last

1032
02:29:16,229 --> 02:29:20,739
And then I gotta do push-ups. Yeah, don't worry. I'll do them. It's fine

1033
02:29:20,739 --> 02:29:25,700
All right, just need the red to get the bottom because that's all dry and then i'm gonna paint the sonic face

1034
02:29:27,829 --> 02:29:34,309
A bird's is what is it? What is this lead paint? What is this based off of this acrylic?

1035
02:29:34,469 --> 02:29:40,379
Can birds even like touch this stuff? I feel like a bird can't touch this

1036
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:52,010
I feel like the music will hit them so hard when they land in here that'll make them say oh my lord

1037
02:29:52,569 --> 02:29:57,690
And then if they go to bird church, they'll be blessed

1038
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:03,290
I'll take the minus twos for that. That was fucking horrible

1039
02:30:09,989 --> 02:30:17,930
All right. Hold on nice coat of red

1040
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:35,190
Almost done. You guys won't let me put on the icing. I'm just gonna do it off fucking camera. Anyway

1041
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:39,559
Anyway, thanks coming up the stream guys. That was a lot of fun and see you later

1042
02:30:39,559 --> 02:30:41,799
I'm gonna fucking drench it with icing

1043
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:56,819
All right. I'm above bob ross right now

1044
02:31:00,940 --> 02:31:06,680
Jesus christ

1045
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:10,340
All right one more little coat

1046
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:13,620
And I can say that this is ready to dry while I do the face

1047
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:19,290
We're ready

1048
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:23,450
Seems sturdy seems like a good fit for any sonic the hedgehog bird

1049
02:31:26,229 --> 02:31:27,829
Let's do the face

1050
02:31:27,829 --> 02:31:30,549
So let's see if my tactic is gonna be worth doing

1051
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:35,370
We'll just do yellow. So I need to put yellow paint in this glue jar

1052
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:45,420
How am I gonna do that?

1053
02:31:45,979 --> 02:31:48,200
It's got limoncello

1054
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:52,040
And it's apple cider. This was called the shooter

1055
02:32:06,309 --> 02:32:08,309
No, never mind. I wanted that

1056
02:32:19,610 --> 02:32:22,649
He's breaking down. No, i'm fine. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Here we go

1057
02:32:23,049 --> 02:32:24,329
I'm gonna get this

1058
02:32:24,329 --> 02:32:28,340
Into there and then we're gonna stir it. This is gonna be hard because take a look at the little hole there

1059
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:33,559
But man if this works, I will be a fucking genius

1060
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:58,920
It's working. It's working

1061
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:09,049
Everybody thought I was insane. That's not gonna work. Jeremy. Oh really

1062
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:27,510
Take a look at my science almost there and I'm gonna put the gap back on

1063
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:43,979
Don't just i'm why am I showing this to you guys it's not that important. There we go

1064
02:33:45,209 --> 02:33:47,209
It is a nice dyed yellow

1065
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:58,280
Put the cap back on and here we go. Check this shit out. All right sonic's face

1066
02:34:58,180 --> 02:35:00,180
His nose is inside of his mouth

1067
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:36,600
I can fix it. Hold on. Oh, well if it wasn't safe for birds before it's definitely not safe for them now

1068
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:40,819
What'd you use for the paint there? Oh glue

1069
02:35:52,549 --> 02:36:04,659
Plank from ed ed and eddie

1070
02:36:04,659 --> 02:36:05,780
I can't put my hands on this

1071
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:09,379
I need to put the chain on and I still need to figure out these fucking two hooks or four

1072
02:36:10,020 --> 02:37:06,780
All right, one last be right back. Hold on. Fuck. Why did I even shut the door that tight? I almost just dumped this

1073
02:37:07,500 --> 02:39:51,450
I almost got it open. It's close

1074
02:39:56,790 --> 02:40:01,059
I tried to get it open with my foot and I couldn't get it. Okay, so

1075
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:18,020
Uh, we're good, right? It moved it moved, huh? Listen closely. There are screams coming from the bird house

1076
02:40:19,850 --> 02:40:40,809
I don't think I want this in my house. You know what I mean? No shit. It's a bird house

1077
02:40:40,809 --> 02:40:48,790
Yeah, but I don't think I like want this near my house. All right. There you go. There's bird house. Let's get these hooks or four something

1078
02:40:49,270 --> 02:40:53,879
Finishing touches and then we smash it

1079
02:40:54,520 --> 02:41:17,540
It's a treasure map three pieces

1080
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:29,340
Three pieces. That's all I got three pieces. All right, so you've created a okay. This is a very hold on

1081
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:32,780
Wait, this is a very specific bird house for very specific birds

1082
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:37,110
Get out get out of the fucking way dummy

1083
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:42,870
All right, so this bird house is for somebody look this up and see if these are in vegas

1084
02:41:45,479 --> 02:41:48,940
Uh, you've just created a perfect home for chickadees

1085
02:41:50,709 --> 02:42:04,600
Nut hatches and finches are any of those in las vegas. I don't think I don't think there are any

1086
02:42:09,110 --> 02:42:11,670
The only birds that we have here in vegas are scorpions

1087
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:15,180
Okay, so connect

1088
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:20,500
I can't believe I have to use the fucking treasure map to figure this out

1089
02:42:24,649 --> 02:42:26,649
Lay roof panel on flat surface

1090
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:32,260
match up the help

1091
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:34,260
Lay roof panel flat on surface

1092
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:38,219
place roof panel at 45 degree angle

1093
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:41,899
proper once you have lined up the nail holes remove

1094
02:42:42,860 --> 02:42:43,819
roof

1095
02:42:43,819 --> 02:42:47,180
Remove roof panel g and run a thin line of glue along the connecting edge play

1096
02:42:47,819 --> 02:42:50,459
Connect one end of the chain to a hook

1097
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:53,260
Run it through the bottom

1098
02:42:53,739 --> 02:42:57,659
Of the roof across the top and back down again attaching it to the other hook

1099
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:10,379
Where's the chain? I know I my mother took it from me because I was playing with it too much

1100
02:43:11,579 --> 02:43:13,579
All right, so like this

1101
02:43:16,629 --> 02:43:17,590
Okay

1102
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:24,819
Hold on just like the crane game. I can get it

1103
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:29,000
This is just one of those tense scenes in a movie

1104
02:43:29,479 --> 02:43:33,959
Where I have to be very quiet because like the weird pig guard over there like the guy with a pig face

1105
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:37,319
He's snoring and he's fat and he's like he ate a bunch of same shit before I came over

1106
02:43:37,319 --> 02:43:39,319
And i'm trying to get the key from his fucking side of his pocket here

1107
02:43:44,979 --> 02:43:49,780
Oh, he woke up. Oh, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. Okay. He's back asleep. I gotta get that key

1108
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:17,559
Just fucking karate chop him in the back of the neck and then take the key. That's what I would do

1109
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:29,209
I'm stuck. All right, so I need to feed this through here

1110
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:37,180
Like this

1111
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:43,770
Wait, hold on. No, no, no, no, this has to go the other way put the hooks down

1112
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:46,870
For a second

1113
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:48,629
Jesus jason

1114
02:44:48,629 --> 02:44:50,629
Oh real name. Fuck

1115
02:45:41,459 --> 02:45:43,780
Get in the fucking hole

1116
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:48,229
It's really just too it's too thin

1117
02:45:49,139 --> 02:45:52,389
It won't go through good and

1118
02:46:05,180 --> 02:46:06,139
Hey

1119
02:46:06,139 --> 02:46:09,270
I'm getting paid. Oh, that's stupid

1120
02:46:10,069 --> 02:46:14,629
Fuck. No, i'm getting it everywhere. God. Damn it. This stupid face

1121
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:21,020
It's a glue

1122
02:46:22,870 --> 02:46:29,190
That's not gonna dry i'm wiping it off. Oh, it's ruined. I've ruined it. Look at the side of the fucking house

1123
02:46:29,829 --> 02:46:42,389
I want to show you that i'm trying it. Do you see what's happening here?

1124
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:55,510
The shit it don't want to work like it don't work it doesn't want to okay got it now

1125
02:47:07,479 --> 02:47:09,239
What does this want me to do?

1126
02:47:09,239 --> 02:47:13,340
You know what I mean?

1127
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:18,170
How does this want me to actually do this do I have to I have to hang this I have to drill those holes somewhere

1128
02:47:23,530 --> 02:47:28,459
What labo is this?

1129
02:47:28,940 --> 02:47:31,180
This is pretty much a labo stream

1130
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:38,739
So then it wants because then you hang it like that. Okay, so this has to come out here

1131
02:47:39,940 --> 02:48:01,299
The hole is just not big enough for the chain to be in here. It's a problem with this device

1132
02:48:04,569 --> 02:48:05,690
All right

1133
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:07,690
We're almost through completely

1134
02:48:09,959 --> 02:48:11,959
So that's that's through

1135
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:13,719
like this

1136
02:48:13,719 --> 02:48:15,959
So, but am I supposed to have these connected?

1137
02:48:16,860 --> 02:48:18,860
So it's like that

1138
02:48:18,860 --> 02:48:27,049
You feel like it's not that hard

1139
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:47,139
Sure, it's in

1140
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:49,959
Now these get connected

1141
02:48:49,959 --> 02:48:56,309
And then it hangs somewhere now. The question is how the fuck am I going to connect these?

1142
02:49:01,739 --> 02:49:03,559
Who needs it?

1143
02:49:03,559 --> 02:49:13,610
Perfect. I need to test it though

1144
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:26,020
Got it. Look at that

1145
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:29,620
It's ready. All right. Now we need to like put stuff in it to pretend there's a bird in there

1146
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:37,290
Here I got an idea

1147
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:39,290
Get wait get in there

1148
02:49:39,770 --> 02:49:46,250
See, it's like a little bird

1149
02:49:46,250 --> 02:50:00,120
Um, okay. I gotta make a family and see how they like it in there. Okay, there's one

1150
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:08,600
Gotta get the baby bird

1151
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:10,920
See, it's like a little baby bird, right? See

1152
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:17,420
I'm gonna make the papa bird

1153
02:50:35,989 --> 02:50:41,479
Um, whatever this is

1154
02:50:41,559 --> 02:50:43,559
Yeah, so now there's a family in there

1155
02:50:45,959 --> 02:50:58,219
Close this shit up. Let's take a look. How does it how is it pretty good? I think so

1156
02:50:58,700 --> 02:51:02,329
This is sturdy

1157
02:51:02,329 --> 02:51:13,479
If it was just hanging on the side there, see that's what's gonna look like when it's hanging

1158
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:26,180
Smash it with the birds in there. I need to connect this though because this it seems

1159
02:51:27,159 --> 02:51:28,680
I can't really bend it

1160
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:35,350
It looks like I can but it's I need like a wire

1161
02:51:35,829 --> 02:51:38,309
I need a like a wire cutter or pliers or something

1162
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:42,020
Well, whatever. All right

1163
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:46,680
There's your bird house

1164
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:58,139
No, it can't fit in there

1165
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:02,950
I can't put any more birds in here

1166
02:52:03,430 --> 02:52:05,659
Now un-paint it

1167
02:52:05,659 --> 02:52:07,979
What do you mean? I can't un-paint a bird house

1168
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:13,370
Make the hole bigger with the hammer

1169
02:52:13,930 --> 02:52:15,450
No, this is perfect

1170
02:52:15,450 --> 02:52:25,420
Okay, it's good

1171
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:28,149
Now burn it

1172
02:52:28,149 --> 02:52:39,049
Wait, how how how am I gonna get that out of there? Oh that that stuff is just in there

1173
02:52:48,680 --> 02:53:38,229
This is bad. I gotta I gotta get rid of that. The wood is split here. Why is that not doing anything?

1174
02:53:38,309 --> 02:53:53,610
Come on get in there. All right, we're good

1175
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:28,090
What is with the scooby-doo nails like I smash one and the other one opens up whack-a-mole. Oh my god. It's stuck in here

1176
02:54:42,729 --> 02:54:45,930
Jesus. All right. We're good

1177
02:54:50,229 --> 02:54:56,069
Okay, it's all free in there. See I need a little bit more of this to put this back on

1178
02:55:01,219 --> 02:55:03,940
This is like hey you Pikachu

1179
02:55:04,659 --> 02:55:17,319
The hell are you talking about? I used all the glue to do the stupid face. Didn't I? Nope. We're still good

1180
02:55:18,659 --> 02:55:20,659
Just need enough to put it on there and so it stays

1181
02:55:24,459 --> 02:55:29,959
Perfect. All right. Come on just a little bit more. That's like you never saw a fucking thing

1182
02:55:31,290 --> 02:55:33,299
Got it

1183
02:55:33,299 --> 02:55:52,149
Okay

1184
02:55:52,149 --> 02:55:55,510
Back to normal. There it is

1185
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:58,379
Eat the glue. I'm not gonna eat the fucking glue

1186
02:55:59,879 --> 02:56:01,879
Glue your fingers together

1187
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:04,600
That doesn't work guys. This isn't a cartoon

1188
02:56:12,180 --> 02:56:17,909
There we go

1189
02:56:17,909 --> 02:56:28,309
There's the bird house. The chain has been the hardest part. That's what broke it the first time. Just do it very carefully

1190
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:33,000
Glue your tongue to a lamp post. It doesn't work. I've tried it

1191
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:43,420
All right

1192
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:45,420
There it is. There's your bird house done

1193
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:50,809
I can't wait to this fucking chain. It's just whatever

1194
02:56:51,670 --> 02:56:54,870
It was it looks fine. It looks all right. It looks cute

1195
02:56:55,430 --> 02:57:05,799
What do I mean pull? What am I doing a pull for?

1196
02:57:10,569 --> 02:57:15,620
A pull for what for this?

1197
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:18,500
The roof is backwards. No, that's sonic the hedgehog

1198
02:57:18,979 --> 02:57:28,260
That's what we decided on a thousand volts. Where do you think i'm gonna get a thousand volts from?

1199
02:57:32,540 --> 02:57:34,409
Look at the paint

1200
02:57:34,409 --> 02:57:37,959
What I mean this paint is some paint here, but that's okay

1201
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:42,760
As long as I don't get it on my desk or on my mouse or on my face or on my body. I'll be fine

1202
02:57:45,670 --> 02:57:49,270
Have we has has sonic heroes been playing the background this whole time? I hope it hasn't

1203
02:57:50,569 --> 02:57:57,829
Under the roof

1204
02:57:57,829 --> 02:58:13,500
I don't have any I don't have any blue. There's no more blue left. It's gonna have to be red

1205
02:58:14,059 --> 02:58:17,450
To my i'm not gonna smash it. This has been almost three hours

1206
02:58:17,850 --> 02:58:25,450
This has been three hours to make this fucking thing. Perfect. Okay, the roof is so bad

1207
02:58:27,299 --> 02:58:39,819
I'm not gonna smash it. This is a this is a piece of memorabilia. It's a memorabilia piece

1208
02:58:40,299 --> 02:58:47,000
That glue is actually pretty good

1209
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:53,260
Fix it with the hammer. I'm gonna get this away from me. Don't put it over there because it's paint on it

1210
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:54,860
I have to look at it

1211
02:58:54,860 --> 02:58:57,639
All right. What am I doing with the treasure? I gotta like clean up

1212
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:06,979
Sell it how much would you help? Okay, let's start it. Start the start the bidding

1213
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:10,180
Start the bidding start the bidding at 30 cents

1214
02:59:10,739 --> 02:59:25,340
Well, that was fun

1215
02:59:26,790 --> 02:59:33,659
I pulled it off the auction. Okay, i'll give you i'll give you six golden rings for it

1216
02:59:34,379 --> 02:59:39,559
I'll trade it for a better one. I made myself

1217
02:59:46,459 --> 02:59:50,379
The back does look a little fucked up, but it doesn't matter. We tried our best

1218
02:59:51,180 --> 02:59:55,020
The resources that we had four dumb shitty cheap paints

1219
02:59:55,659 --> 02:59:58,700
A little stick of don't eat me glue a treasure map

1220
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:01,260
And badly cut wood

1221
03:00:22,360 --> 03:00:28,540
Never mind. This took him four hours. Don't add time for no reason. It was three

1222
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:31,579
This took him four hours. This would be three hours

1223
03:00:31,659 --> 03:00:34,540
Okay, not four don't add time to make it funnier

1224
03:00:34,780 --> 03:00:41,100
It was three and by the way an hour of that was us just chilling out and talking and playing in our irl stream

1225
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:47,049
So it wasn't a complete and total build that I left. I washed my hands. It probably took like

1226
03:00:47,530 --> 03:00:53,209
Two and a half hours and we were just hanging out. We that's what we were doing today

1227
03:00:54,790 --> 03:01:02,170
I'm gonna smash it. Don't smash it. This didn't take nine hours

1228
03:01:04,139 --> 03:01:06,139
I look like kind of dirty today

1229
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:10,170
It's because of this that's right. I forgot

1230
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:20,200
Face cam you putting it up. Where am I gonna? Oh, I have to do a push-up, right?

1231
03:01:21,239 --> 03:01:22,700
Here

1232
03:01:22,700 --> 03:01:24,700
I can't touch anything. Just let me be right back

1233
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:27,420
Let's just like we're gonna chill and hang out for a little bit longer

1234
03:01:29,719 --> 03:01:35,620
I need to like clean the fuck up, but I can't do that yet. Hey, let me i'm gonna move this

1235
03:01:36,440 --> 03:01:40,149
To somewhere safe

1236
03:01:40,549 --> 03:01:47,850
Just move the whole fucking thing. Hold on

1237
03:01:48,010 --> 03:01:50,010
It looks like a torture instrument

1238
03:01:53,780 --> 03:01:55,860
It's very clearly a bird house

1239
03:01:57,979 --> 03:01:59,819
Oh, hey birdot

1240
03:01:59,819 --> 03:02:04,090
We've got a bird coming in right now with five community subs. Thank you birdot

1241
03:02:06,299 --> 03:02:08,299
See, I told you birds love this thing

1242
03:02:08,860 --> 03:02:14,389
All right. Let me at least like hold on. Let me at least wash my hands and i'll come back and we'll just hang out

1243
03:02:14,389 --> 03:03:32,600
For a second. Hold on. Okay

1244
03:03:33,430 --> 03:03:35,110
So whoa

1245
03:03:35,110 --> 03:03:37,110
Hold on. That's

1246
03:03:37,270 --> 03:03:53,860
hold on there

1247
03:03:53,860 --> 03:04:02,040
Naked see I had to wear clothes today and that sucks move this back to here

1248
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:13,450
Actually, let me just go like this. All right. So, uh, that was that thank you for joining me on that

1249
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:17,059
Let me move

1250
03:04:17,059 --> 03:04:19,909
Do I have?

1251
03:04:19,909 --> 03:04:23,620
Yeah, I should be using the other camera, but it's all good

1252
03:04:25,020 --> 03:04:27,139
It's all good

1253
03:04:27,139 --> 03:04:31,299
So that was kind of the plan today and i'm going to give you a couple of things to look forward to

1254
03:04:32,170 --> 03:04:36,709
Uh, oh, that's disgusting. That was not a bug around my hand. Okay

1255
03:04:37,510 --> 03:04:40,069
So many people are gonna freeze frame this image

1256
03:04:40,629 --> 03:04:42,760
It was like this

1257
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:47,239
And people are gonna be like what the fuck is that on his thumb? There's like yellow green boogers on his hands

1258
03:04:47,239 --> 03:04:54,100
It's paint. Oh freeze it right there dude. What does he have in his thumb? Is that like fucking schnauz?

1259
03:04:56,219 --> 03:04:59,340
No, so, uh, I want to go over a couple of things while there's still a lot of people here

1260
03:04:59,579 --> 03:05:01,579
Thanks for coming out. That was just a stupid

1261
03:05:01,819 --> 03:05:06,860
Uh one guy said to do that and that was that was the stream was the one guy said to build bird house

1262
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:10,680
Proving yet again that you could be the one guy

1263
03:05:11,350 --> 03:05:15,750
Uh, but what i've been doing the last couple of days and today and i'm going to continue to do today

1264
03:05:16,309 --> 03:05:18,309
And probably tomorrow and for the next few days

1265
03:05:18,950 --> 03:05:23,610
The christmas eve stream is is there's two things that are going to happen here

1266
03:05:24,889 --> 03:05:30,219
Uh, I can't really talk about them yet, but is that if I can get

1267
03:05:30,940 --> 03:05:32,379
studio time

1268
03:05:32,379 --> 03:05:37,670
On christmas eve watch out for that fucking stream because it's going to be insane

1269
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:43,500
If I can do what I want to do on christmas eve i'm going to try and that's why I took the last couple days off

1270
03:05:44,389 --> 03:05:47,030
Um, not green screen part two something completely different

1271
03:05:48,250 --> 03:05:49,290
uh

1272
03:05:49,290 --> 03:05:51,510
If I can get in there

1273
03:05:51,510 --> 03:05:54,020
I'm gonna have a lot of fun

1274
03:05:54,020 --> 03:05:56,020
So it's something i've been trying to plan

1275
03:05:56,100 --> 03:06:00,219
And something i've been spending a lot of time recently trying to get it to work

1276
03:06:00,620 --> 03:06:03,979
And if it doesn't work if I can't get into the studio on christmas eve

1277
03:06:04,459 --> 03:06:06,459
We're still going to do something

1278
03:06:06,459 --> 03:06:10,379
That's going to be very very fun. I'll give you more details very soon

1279
03:06:10,379 --> 03:06:14,540
I've only got like another couple days to plan this really before knowing if it's going to be possible

1280
03:06:15,020 --> 03:06:21,030
In studio or out of studio. So it's kind of what i've been doing over the last uh,

1281
03:06:21,510 --> 03:06:25,590
No, not ipad game something different something that you haven't seen before on the channel something different

1282
03:06:26,229 --> 03:06:30,120
Something a little different but let me uh move with this

1283
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:39,430
I need to I need like the better camera because after this this camera like sucks

1284
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:47,159
But it does i'll tell you what it does involve. No, I can't i'm not gonna do that

1285
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:52,260
There's like five different segments that are gonna be on that stream if it happens and it's gonna i'm gonna put a ton

1286
03:06:52,340 --> 03:07:03,219
Of time into it. Well, that's as good as i'm gonna be able to get because I can't put the other camera in

1287
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:07,100
It's an incoming joke. No, no incoming jokes

1288
03:07:07,659 --> 03:07:19,420
Well, actually incoming joke potentially on the 24th because that's christmas eve gonna play alf shirt. Yeah

1289
03:07:20,790 --> 03:07:23,190
No problem. This motherfucker used to eat cats. You know that right?

1290
03:07:27,209 --> 03:07:31,930
I thought he was a cat. He's a cat with

1291
03:07:33,579 --> 03:07:35,579
Look at this like pompadour haircut. He has

1292
03:07:37,909 --> 03:07:43,000
You sure? Yeah, I know we've talked about the hole in the shirt. I need to get off of um

1293
03:07:43,159 --> 03:07:49,940
I need to get off of this because i'm on art right now and i'm just kind of sitting here

1294
03:07:50,020 --> 03:07:52,020
So let's go back to just chatting for a little bit

1295
03:07:52,659 --> 03:07:58,979
So plan over the next couple days like oh what no no title just chatting. No that I build a birdhouse complete

1296
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:01,459
birdhouse

1297
03:08:01,459 --> 03:08:02,739
done

1298
03:08:02,739 --> 03:08:05,299
and then in brackets

1299
03:08:05,299 --> 03:08:10,020
Pretty decent. Okay, and then this is just chatting

1300
03:08:11,639 --> 03:08:13,639
Because that's what we're actually doing now

1301
03:08:15,510 --> 03:08:29,659
Oh, I think I got the push-ups. Fine. Here you go. I can't you can't even see this

1302
03:08:33,850 --> 03:08:35,850
This is what's this tv?

1303
03:08:36,170 --> 03:08:39,610
No, that's my chair. I thought that was like a giant fucking tv. Get out of the way

1304
03:08:43,260 --> 03:08:53,819
You can see here. Okay. Come on. There you go. I don't care green. Where's green from?

1305
03:08:54,379 --> 03:09:09,239
I thought there's a person behind me. What the fuck is wrong with me right now? What's wrong with me?

1306
03:09:11,239 --> 03:09:13,239
I thought this was a person

1307
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:16,020
Like standing behind me

1308
03:09:18,329 --> 03:09:20,329
I'm losing my fucking mind

1309
03:09:20,569 --> 03:09:24,379
I just caught it in the peripheral like who the fuck is that guy?

1310
03:09:27,879 --> 03:09:31,319
Too much paint. Yeah, I'm like breathing these fucking fumes

1311
03:09:33,479 --> 03:09:38,459
But anywho, yeah that so let's go over a couple things one christmas stream

1312
03:09:39,260 --> 03:09:41,020
Uh incoming

1313
03:09:41,020 --> 03:09:45,979
And it's gonna be fun and whether it's in the studio or not in the studio. I got two different plans

1314
03:09:46,940 --> 03:09:49,180
Tomorrow, we're probably gonna play hotline miami 2

1315
03:09:49,739 --> 03:09:53,420
And i'm just gonna play it all day and all night. That's the plan tomorrow

1316
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:55,989
uh

1317
03:09:55,989 --> 03:09:57,940
and then

1318
03:09:57,940 --> 03:10:00,379
so monday

1319
03:10:00,379 --> 03:10:02,870
I'm probably going to take

1320
03:10:02,870 --> 03:10:04,870
monday and tuesday off

1321
03:10:05,270 --> 03:10:08,950
Because I desperately want to try to get this stream to work for christmas eve

1322
03:10:09,430 --> 03:10:16,409
And it's gonna take a lot of off stream work where I can't really be live. I have to be making phone calls and hiring

1323
03:10:17,139 --> 03:10:19,059
people and

1324
03:10:19,059 --> 03:10:24,020
Without giving anything away. I have to really really give it an honest try because I think it's gonna be a lot of fun

1325
03:10:24,739 --> 03:10:30,739
So that's the plan over the next couple of days tonight. We had this tomorrow. We're doing hotline miami

1326
03:10:30,819 --> 03:10:33,540
I don't i might try to beat all of hotline miami tomorrow

1327
03:10:34,739 --> 03:10:37,459
Try to give you guys like a good like eight to ten hours stream tomorrow

1328
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:40,899
Just fucking beat the damn game just play it and fucking engross into it

1329
03:10:43,620 --> 03:10:49,909
Nervous streamer. No, I don't think so when I talk about

1330
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:52,549
I'll give you a little

1331
03:10:52,549 --> 03:10:55,829
Uh in depth into my life here when i'm just like being me

1332
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:03,719
It's like hard to just be me i'm gonna be with a camera on like if i'm doing like a character or like

1333
03:11:03,799 --> 03:11:08,520
Voices look at how easy i'm not nervous at all, but i'm like, hey, i'm just like talking to you guys

1334
03:11:08,520 --> 03:11:12,520
I'm like a camera on it's like wait, hold on. I gotta be me

1335
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:18,020
So guys, uh, hey, it's me and uh

1336
03:11:24,659 --> 03:11:29,940
Is there a guy i'm kidding i'm not nervous. I don't know why I would be why would I be nervous right now?

1337
03:11:32,739 --> 03:11:34,739
I don't have like a reason to be nervous

1338
03:11:34,899 --> 03:11:39,579
Just kind of I just talk too fast

1339
03:11:39,579 --> 03:11:44,459
Stop shaking speaking of shaking. Is there any coffee left in here or tea?

1340
03:11:49,270 --> 03:11:52,549
All right. I had a panic attack in my brain for a second. I thought there was paint in here

1341
03:11:53,579 --> 03:11:57,260
I thought because remember I reached over to this and I was like, oh, yeah dip that in there

1342
03:11:57,899 --> 03:12:01,579
I thought like it was like three hours ago now. I thought I did that

1343
03:12:02,299 --> 03:12:09,540
There's nothing even look at it's like empty you want me to drink that gross dirt at the bottom

1344
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:16,090
He's flying off the handle. No, but that's the plan

1345
03:12:16,569 --> 03:12:19,209
I really hope I can get it to work because it'll be

1346
03:12:21,260 --> 03:12:23,260
If I can do what I want to do on christmas eve

1347
03:12:23,260 --> 03:12:28,229
It will be the most intricate stream that i've ever done by far

1348
03:12:28,870 --> 03:12:36,569
By a fucking million times so it's gonna be we'll try i'll try i'm gonna try as hard as I fucking can

1349
03:12:36,809 --> 03:12:41,260
But if I can't get it

1350
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:47,850
Then we'll have plan b and plan b is not as elaborate and intricate as the studio stream is

1351
03:12:49,459 --> 03:12:54,440
But it'll still be a lot of fun

1352
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:57,319
This is not something that i've talked about before this is just a christmas

1353
03:12:58,379 --> 03:13:00,870
Themed stream that's all you need to know

1354
03:13:04,790 --> 03:13:09,270
But let me let me hammer out some of the details before I really like announce anything because it's very easy to be like

1355
03:13:09,350 --> 03:13:13,110
So this is what's happening on christmas eve and I hope you're there and it's gonna be a lot of fun

1356
03:13:13,190 --> 03:13:19,879
And this is exactly what's happening and then some of it just doesn't happen. So I'd rather why are you guys adding push-ups?

1357
03:13:24,579 --> 03:13:32,090
What what what what what's this command that we're adding from push-ups somebody adding plus one push-up

1358
03:13:33,989 --> 03:13:44,309
Why I didn't do them all. Oh, it's being deleted. It's being deleted. Okay, I get it

1359
03:13:46,569 --> 03:13:48,569
Why would you be counting those in the first place?

1360
03:13:53,989 --> 03:13:56,170
christmas eve present

1361
03:13:56,170 --> 03:13:58,149
maybe

1362
03:13:58,149 --> 03:13:59,930
maybe

1363
03:13:59,930 --> 03:14:02,329
Keep your ear to the ground over the next few days guys

1364
03:14:05,159 --> 03:14:07,159
hopefully I have something interesting to announce but

1365
03:14:07,719 --> 03:14:11,479
Uh speaking of that it's still early enough where I can go work on it

1366
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:16,229

1406
03:17:12,299 --> 03:17:17,020
PS your hair is looking really good today. Did you do something special with it? I use a couple of products

1407
03:17:18,329 --> 03:17:20,729
I don't here here's tip number one. I don't put any

1408
03:17:21,450 --> 03:17:23,059
product in my hair

1409
03:17:23,059 --> 03:17:28,329
Right. I use products in the shower. So i'm in the shower and I use good

1410
03:17:28,969 --> 03:17:32,409
Shampoos and conditioners and then I don't do anything else to it

1411
03:17:32,409 --> 03:17:35,129
And I let it do what it's gonna do and make sure it's nice and fluffy

1412
03:17:36,940 --> 03:17:40,219
I don't put hair gel mousse. I don't do that at all. Never

1413
03:17:46,940 --> 03:17:54,389
Your hair is fluffy in the shower when you get out and you fluff it up

1414
03:17:55,209 --> 03:17:57,209
I get I fluff it up and then I leave it alone

1415
03:17:59,799 --> 03:18:01,799
Moose hair what?

1416
03:18:02,120 --> 03:18:09,829
How often do I comb only after the shower? So I get out of the shower. I brush my teeth

1417
03:18:10,389 --> 03:18:12,790
Sometimes I brush my teeth in the shower to save some time

1418
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:15,850
Sometimes I piss in the shower

1419
03:18:16,090 --> 03:18:17,850
To save some time

1420
03:18:17,850 --> 03:18:19,850
Uh, and then when I get out of the shower

1421
03:18:22,389 --> 03:18:27,270
I just go live with a comb not a fine tooth comb because you know, you don't want to rip out hairs

1422
03:18:31,129 --> 03:18:33,129
You go back with it. You know what I mean?

1423
03:18:33,450 --> 03:18:36,010
You just kind of get it nice. So it's not all crazy and

1424
03:18:36,569 --> 03:18:41,129
Flip it up a little bit make it do fluff it up and then leave it alone and make sure it's it's been combed

1425
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:45,899
And then I leave it alone

1426
03:18:45,899 --> 03:18:49,739
Why we all yeah you all everybody pees in the shower. Don't ever anybody that's weird

1427
03:18:50,379 --> 03:18:51,979
Why do people say that?

1428
03:18:51,979 --> 03:18:55,420
What the fuck you what's wrong with you? You did that today

1429
03:18:56,139 --> 03:19:00,739
I know you did

1430
03:19:00,739 --> 03:19:02,420
I know you did it today

1431
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:14,379
did I ever tell you guys the story of when I was in college and somebody was peeing in the shower and

1432
03:19:15,020 --> 03:19:20,219
Everybody was upset about it. It's like dude. Somebody's like pissing in the shower. Somebody's peeing in the shower, dude

1433
03:19:20,219 --> 03:19:22,700
I don't know. Who is it? It was like 10 of us

1434
03:19:23,420 --> 03:19:28,090
Like almost 12 of us that lived in this place and there was detective work

1435
03:19:28,090 --> 03:19:30,090
Everybody was trying to find out who it was

1436
03:19:31,530 --> 03:19:34,409
And huh, here's the punchline all of us was doing it

1437
03:19:35,780 --> 03:19:39,059
It was like pretend we were pretending that we were upset about it for some reason

1438
03:19:39,379 --> 03:19:42,659
Nobody wanted to get caught

1439
03:19:42,659 --> 03:19:52,649
It was at least like four or five of us that were doing it and I remember sitting on the couch being like who's fucking

1440
03:19:52,649 --> 03:19:54,459
Doing this man

1441
03:19:54,459 --> 03:19:58,459
That's like really messed up like stop doing that like we go in there and I was doing it

1442
03:20:07,850 --> 03:20:10,729
There are people who piss in the shower and then there are liars

1443
03:20:14,819 --> 03:20:25,700
Do you pee in other people's showers guys? I don't piss in the shower every fucking single time

1444
03:20:26,340 --> 03:20:28,340
Okay

1445
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:35,670
Please be clear about this

1446
03:20:35,670 --> 03:20:45,590
If I come over to your house, I'm not gonna pee in your shower. No, I'm not I wouldn't do that

1447
03:20:49,500 --> 03:20:52,309
I'm a liar

1448
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:58,360
Don't invite him over your house man. He's gonna pee in your house

1449
03:21:00,440 --> 03:21:04,840
Why are you showering at my house? Because because you invited me over there and I like stay the night

1450
03:21:05,319 --> 03:21:12,120
What do you mean? Why am I this we're talking about if I was invited to sleep over and I stayed there and I agreed

1451
03:21:12,200 --> 03:21:14,200
And we both were like, yeah, that would be fun

1452
03:21:17,559 --> 03:21:20,120
Do you shit in the shower too? No, it's a polar deal

1453
03:21:20,120 --> 03:21:23,159
You gotta open up the drain and it's like a pain in the ass. I haven't I don't do it anymore

1454
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:37,799
I'm sorry anymore

1455
03:21:37,799 --> 03:21:41,340
No, never I pee in the shower like three times a year

1456
03:21:42,360 --> 03:21:44,600
This is all this is all just smoke and mirrors

1457
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:53,860
Anyway, thank you to sprite 37 for the one dollar. Hope you're enjoying las vegas and it's treating you better than it did

1458
03:21:54,420 --> 03:21:56,420

03:21:57,219 --> 03:21:59,219
Be safe and I hope you have a chance to check out

1460
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:02,899
Excalibur's tournament of kings if you decide to visit the strip

1461
03:22:04,299 --> 03:22:06,299
There's a lot of interesting stuff on the strip

1462
03:22:06,950 --> 03:22:09,850
But yeah, you do have you do have to like just be careful

1463
03:22:11,420 --> 03:22:13,260
You can get really sucked in

1464
03:22:13,260 --> 03:22:15,799
to the vegas culture

1465
03:22:15,799 --> 03:22:17,059
so

1466
03:22:17,059 --> 03:22:20,870
actually, um

1467
03:22:20,870 --> 03:22:24,549
I wanted to go to the esports arena at some point here

1468
03:22:25,190 --> 03:22:30,940
To check it out because that's on the strip. I think we were talking about that

1469
03:22:31,340 --> 03:22:44,360
A few weeks ago in the luxor. Yeah, did you move to las vegas? Yes, I did

1470
03:22:44,840 --> 03:22:46,920
Uh just about a few months ago now

1471
03:22:47,639 --> 03:22:54,940
Back in october

1472
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:56,940
Well, I don't think you're ready to compete

1473
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:01,590
No to watch

1474
03:23:01,590 --> 03:23:03,590
And i'm gonna go to evo this year

1475
03:23:04,309 --> 03:23:06,469
Because that's right in vegas. Oh

1476
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:12,620
I've always wanted to go to evo just because I feel like it's an interesting thing to watch

1477
03:23:18,540 --> 03:23:22,379
I want to go watch like mortal kombat 11 at evo. It'll be held by then

1478
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:29,020
What the hell is evo?

1479
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:31,260
Uh evo is the fighting game tournaments

1480
03:23:31,899 --> 03:23:37,350
But yeah, I I kind of said I wasn't gonna do any more

1481
03:23:38,229 --> 03:23:41,510
any conventions for the next probably six to twelve months just because

1482
03:23:42,709 --> 03:23:45,260
Moving was very expensive

1483
03:23:45,260 --> 03:23:46,219
and

1484
03:23:46,219 --> 03:23:47,500
Spent

1485
03:23:47,500 --> 03:23:52,059
We spent we've spent a lot of money so far just on getting this place livable

1486
03:23:54,700 --> 03:23:56,620
So I kind of like yeah, you know that

1487
03:23:57,340 --> 03:23:59,340
that expensive trip to

1488
03:23:59,979 --> 03:24:07,819
Like twitchcon or the the expensive hotel rooms at packs east going back it's I just I don't think I'd be able to do it

1489
03:24:11,579 --> 03:24:13,420
but 2019

1490
03:24:13,420 --> 03:24:19,700
Somewhere in the halfway point in the summertime. I'll probably be making my way back to conventions and stuff. So

1491
03:24:21,930 --> 03:24:27,479
Anywho, uh, thank you sprite. I've been enjoying vegas so far. Thank you

1492

From joey and then a big 10 dollars here from jinxibo

1498
03:25:05,020 --> 03:25:09,020
Jerma is like that weird uncle who keeps telling the same fucked up story every time you meet him

1499
03:25:09,340 --> 03:25:11,340
And you're still not sure if it's real or not

1500
03:25:11,579 --> 03:25:14,860
So you sit there nervously contemplating whether you should laugh or not

1501
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:18,139
I got you right where I want you

1502
03:25:18,219 --> 03:25:22,549
It's like anything could be real

1503
03:25:22,629 --> 03:25:47,399
Anything could be real. You know what I mean? What does your reality look like? Huh?

1504
03:25:50,709 --> 03:25:59,399
Hmm. Tell me what does your reality look like?

1505
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:09,030
What does your reality look like? But you can't even see it. You're gonna turn off these monitors

1506
03:26:09,829 --> 03:26:15,180
It's a this ball. It's a glow-in-the-dark like squishy ball

1507
03:26:21,579 --> 03:26:23,340
I don't know why this is in here

1508
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:26,180
Hold on. Can you see?

1509
03:26:26,180 --> 03:26:32,469
I gotta

1510
03:26:32,469 --> 03:26:38,069
Let that sit there for a minute. It's I fucked it up. It doesn't matter

1511
03:26:41,620 --> 03:26:44,180
I he could wait down. All right. Whoa

1512
03:26:46,040 --> 03:26:50,280
See, it looks like this. There we go. It's kind of glowing. I gotta get all these monitors turned off

1529
03:29:38,040 --> 03:29:41,049
For those of you boomers in here

1530
03:29:42,260 --> 03:29:46,899
Hey, awesome. Awesome alec. Thanks for the one dollar. If you were a bird, I think you could fit in that house

1531
03:29:48,809 --> 03:29:52,069
back to back

1532
03:29:52,069 --> 03:29:56,500
Back to back. Hey dubski dude. Thanks for the one dollar

1533
03:29:56,500 --> 03:30:00,260
The act of you turning on your webcam is the equivalent of taking a sledgehammer to my already

1534
03:30:00,879 --> 03:30:02,879
fragile heterosexuality

1535
03:30:08,389 --> 03:30:15,930
Well, thank you dubski

1536
03:30:15,930 --> 03:30:17,930
Thank you so much for the one dollar

1537
03:30:18,250 --> 03:30:22,149
Although I don't know I have like weird days

1538
03:30:23,899 --> 03:30:26,059
I have days where I look in the mirror and I go. Ooh nice

1539
03:30:26,139 --> 03:30:28,139
And then I have days where I look in the mirror and I go. Ooh

1540
03:30:30,600 --> 03:30:33,670
I think we all have those days though

1541
03:30:33,750 --> 03:30:36,870
But thank you

1542
03:30:36,870 --> 03:30:38,309
Thank you

1543
03:30:38,309 --> 03:30:43,190
Thank you. She xoxo for the one dollar. Hey germa. Where did you get that pac-man mug?

1544
03:30:43,989 --> 03:30:48,489
Looks really neat. I have secret locations like amazon.com

1545
03:30:50,950 --> 03:30:53,270
Now you can get it. There's a lot of places you can get it get it online

1546
03:30:56,299 --> 03:31:00,059
You can get it. There's a lot of like novelty gift stores. You can get it at if you have

1547
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:02,780
One of those weird novelty stores near you

1548
03:31:07,510 --> 03:31:09,780
Sponsored by amazon

1549
03:31:09,780 --> 03:31:12,020
Now this whole website is sponsored by amazon

1550
03:31:12,020 --> 03:31:18,090
What are you on about the entire this whole entire platform is now sponsored by amazon the whole thing

1551
03:31:23,479 --> 03:31:25,479
I didn't that's not my decision

1552
03:31:31,379 --> 03:31:33,620
But thank you for the one dollar

1553
03:31:33,700 --> 03:31:36,420
Hey logan. Thanks logan for the one dollar. Hey germa. I've been a big fan

1554
03:31:36,739 --> 03:31:39,860
I've been a big fan since tf2 days and this is the worst thing i've ever seen

1555
03:31:40,819 --> 03:31:44,180
Thanks god bless hashtag charity. I told you guys

1556
03:31:44,979 --> 03:31:56,329
I've made sure your expectations were very low today. Thank you logan. Thank you. Novi for the one dollar

1557
03:31:56,329 --> 03:32:00,010
This is more embarrassing than the raptor hashtag charity. Nope. What?

1558
03:32:02,540 --> 03:32:07,500
Me building a bird house on stream is more embarrassing than me putting on

1559
03:32:08,059 --> 03:32:10,540
A dinosaur costume and making dinosaur noises

1560
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:19,659
No fucking way absolute there's no way that I can agree with that they're about equal

1561
03:32:25,420 --> 03:32:27,420
Thank you, thank you hans beats for the two bucks

1562
03:32:27,420 --> 03:32:29,500
He's still going to do the do the music stream

1563
03:32:30,299 --> 03:32:33,420
In fl studio love the streams. Thanks for the laughs. Yes

1564
03:32:36,360 --> 03:32:38,360
That's kind of in the back pocket right now

1565
03:32:40,469 --> 03:32:44,629
In fact, that will probably end up being the next large stream

1566
03:32:45,639 --> 03:32:48,120
after the christmas one

1567
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:50,120
Because I have quite a few ideas

1568
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:54,219
And now that I have access to that studio and I told you pretty much like once a month

1569
03:32:54,219 --> 03:32:56,620
I want to get in that studio and do something

1570
03:32:58,229 --> 03:33:01,270
And we're talking about potentially hiring like a real band

1571
03:33:01,829 --> 03:33:03,670
to like record and

1572
03:33:03,670 --> 03:33:05,670
Make terrible fucking music

1573
03:33:08,520 --> 03:33:10,520
I mean

1574
03:33:10,520 --> 03:33:13,959
There's I have access to stuff now that I never had before

1575
03:33:18,620 --> 03:33:23,020
Hire like a hire like an actual audio engineer to mix together songs

1576
03:33:23,899 --> 03:33:28,059
This this goes way beyond me just fucking around in fl studio at this point

1577
03:33:38,729 --> 03:33:40,729
Make up the band name make a whole album

1578
03:33:42,149 --> 03:33:45,110
God, we'll see though. I'm i'm i'm into it

1579
03:33:45,670 --> 03:33:49,590
So but now that'll happen after the christmas stream because if the christmas tree does happen

1580
03:33:50,229 --> 03:33:53,350
The way that I want that will also be a fairly large stream. So

1581
03:33:54,170 --> 03:33:59,370
Got to spread them out once a month or so once every like 40 30 to 45 days. That's what I want

1582
03:34:02,010 --> 03:34:05,930
Uh, thank you tingy for the one dollar. Remember to pick up the nails you dropped ps. I'm really glad you're not

1583
03:34:06,489 --> 03:34:08,489
a contractor hashtag charity

1584
03:34:11,079 --> 03:34:15,159
Yeah, if I I did I did kind of make a fool out of myself trying to hammer those in didn't I

1585
03:34:17,399 --> 03:34:18,899
That's all right

1586
03:34:18,899 --> 03:34:23,780
Thank you butter dirt for the one dollar. If you really want to do this. Well, you'd use wood glue and clams

1587
03:34:24,500 --> 03:34:25,700
German moon

1588
03:34:25,700 --> 03:34:31,750
It was whatever came in the kit. Oh clamps. Okay

1589
03:34:34,100 --> 03:34:38,659
Ferotian weapon. Thanks for the ten dollars ferotian looks like you don't skip arm day

1590
03:34:40,329 --> 03:34:43,079
I never used to and it just stuck with me

1591
03:34:43,159 --> 03:34:46,680
I I did so many arm workouts guys that my arms still look fucking sick

1592
03:34:47,239 --> 03:34:58,299
It uh, I don't even do it anymore, but thank you for the ten dollars ferotian weapon. Appreciate it. Thank you so much

1593
03:34:59,690 --> 03:35:01,129
Extra cheesy. Thanks for the one dollar

1594
03:35:01,129 --> 03:35:04,170
I was on break at work and showed someone your stream while I was watching it

1595
03:35:04,170 --> 03:35:07,129
They looked at me with a mix of confusion and judgmental contempt

1596
03:35:07,930 --> 03:35:11,450
Also, if you had to pick one, would you rather be stranded somewhere really hot or really cold?

1597
03:35:12,579 --> 03:35:20,969
Uh, really probably really hot. I mean they both have awful consequences really cold you freeze to death really hot you dehydrate to death

1598
03:35:22,809 --> 03:35:29,290
Which one of those things would you rather do probably hot because I feel like I could like

1599
03:35:29,930 --> 03:35:31,049
search

1600
03:35:31,049 --> 03:35:32,170
While it was hot

1601
03:35:32,170 --> 03:35:45,500
You can't really search when it's cold for stuff because it's your body locks up and heat you die slower

1602
03:35:45,579 --> 03:35:47,579
Yeah, but that gives me more time to search

1603
03:35:48,090 --> 03:35:49,129
for like

1604
03:35:49,129 --> 03:35:52,569
I don't know i'm stranded on a desert island. We're like the fucking bananas and coconuts and

1605
03:35:53,409 --> 03:35:57,110
Strawberries and carrots and shit. They might be on that island. I can that gives me more time to find them

1606
03:36:03,399 --> 03:36:09,079
Thank you irate gamer screen cap for the one dollar germa you'd look really hot in a choker

1607
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:15,100
I don't know why I just read that

1608
03:36:15,100 --> 03:36:17,879
Thank you for the one dollar demonic cucumber

1609
03:36:17,879 --> 03:36:21,159
Thanks for the one dollar considering the large amount of predatory birds in the vegas area

1610
03:36:21,479 --> 03:36:28,040
Are you sure that by encouraging smaller birds to stay in one place you aren't just building a bird feeder for a larger audience?

1611
03:36:33,530 --> 03:36:38,559
We're making just like a live feeding den for vultures

1612
03:36:39,360 --> 03:36:46,590
Thanks for the advice

1613
03:36:46,590 --> 03:36:51,559
Thank you to par follow eel for the one dollar. It's a youtube link. I'm not gonna make the mistake by clicking it again

1614
03:36:54,760 --> 03:37:05,899
Uh, it's a guy like putting a bird in his mouth. I want a fun fucking thank you for the one dollar

1615
03:37:08,750 --> 03:37:10,750
extra cheesy

1616
03:37:10,829 --> 03:37:15,149
Thank you. Why is the game cube intro playing? What the fuck? Okay, here we go

1617
03:37:17,370 --> 03:37:18,649
Thank you

1618
03:37:18,649 --> 03:37:24,809
One dollar extra cheesy the judgmental man was some old crotchy guy who wouldn't understand the antics of us

1619
03:37:25,209 --> 03:37:30,809
Fry young streamers such as yourself. So don't worry. You're still cool. Also, i'm the place you're stranded on

1620
03:37:31,290 --> 03:37:34,090
Would you rather eat a razor death adder or a logitech mouse?

1621
03:37:35,049 --> 03:37:38,969
Well, a razor death adder would mean I would have to have it with me and I would not want that with me

1622
03:37:40,430 --> 03:37:42,909
So I probably want to take the logitech mouse

1623
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:52,719
Thank you. Demonic cucumber again for the one dollar. Hey jeremy back again

1624
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:55,360
Wanted to clarify something about my bits from earlier this week

1625
03:37:55,360 --> 03:38:00,239
What I meant was you are a very attractive man regardless of your age not in spite of it

1626
03:38:00,639 --> 03:38:02,879
I'm crushing pretty hard to be honest

1627
03:38:06,799 --> 03:38:08,809
Well, thank you

1628
03:38:08,809 --> 03:38:10,969
No, that's very very kind of you. That's very nice of you

1629
03:38:12,139 --> 03:38:13,799
um

1630
03:38:13,799 --> 03:38:15,639
I don't

1631
03:38:15,639 --> 03:38:17,639
Thanks. I don't

1632
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:22,760
I don't know how to I don't even know how to react and people give me compliments like this

1633
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:27,920
because I don't know

1634
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:29,760
I like sit on the couch

1635
03:38:29,760 --> 03:38:34,879
And like shit my pants and stuff and like don't get up and like then I I I get like fed

1636
03:38:34,959 --> 03:38:39,340
Fed

1637
03:38:39,340 --> 03:38:41,579
None of that's true. None of that's true. I'm just

1638
03:38:49,520 --> 03:38:52,559
I don't know where I get fed comes from i'm serious

1639
03:38:53,360 --> 03:38:57,200
I get fed it's because we're talking about the vultures and that just jumped into my brain

1640
03:39:09,479 --> 03:39:11,479
I don't know what I was going with that

1641
03:39:11,479 --> 03:39:15,479
See, I told you I don't know how to act when somebody says things like this. Thank you demonic cucumber

1642
03:39:16,879 --> 03:39:18,879
again for another dollar here

1643
03:39:19,040 --> 03:39:23,040
Also, my mom wanted to threaten chat for implying that she was old

1644
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:29,040
But I can't post what she said because i'd get banned just be warned chat. She's a scary lady

1645
03:39:34,940 --> 03:39:36,649
Yeah

1646
03:39:36,649 --> 03:39:38,649
Don't talk about somebody's mother like that

1647
03:39:39,709 --> 03:39:46,620
She's not old

1648
03:39:46,620 --> 03:39:48,860
Kim and italics must have their hands full with you

1649
03:39:50,329 --> 03:39:54,319
No, i'm very good

1650
03:39:54,319 --> 03:39:56,319
I'm very good. Don't worry

1651
03:40:00,040 --> 03:40:04,120
Just put a face cloth on while you talk. Why would I put a what a face cloth?

1652
03:40:04,840 --> 03:40:09,239
Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar fun fact. This is the fourth stream in a row

1653
03:40:10,120 --> 03:40:14,840
Where you've made the hey peter joke. No, I did not when did I say hey peter this whole entire stream?

1654
03:40:16,379 --> 03:40:20,600
I did not go. Hey peter. No, I didn't when

1655
03:40:25,840 --> 03:40:27,920
I did an hour ago. No, I didn't

1656
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:35,100
You actually did you literally did?

1657
03:40:36,090 --> 03:40:40,329
I need to have this proved to me because I definitely do not remember doing. Hey peter

1658
03:40:44,040 --> 03:40:50,239
There's no way

1659
03:40:50,239 --> 03:40:52,239
Time to go vod diving

1660
03:40:54,329 --> 03:40:56,889
All right, somebody can get that to me because I like okay we talking

1661
03:40:57,690 --> 03:40:59,770
Because there's two different ways to say peter

1662
03:41:00,329 --> 03:41:06,010
There's hey, uh, hey, i'm joe swanson from family guy and uh peter. Let me tell you something now peter

1663
03:41:06,649 --> 03:41:18,809
Peter right then there's uh, don't tell harry peter. That's not the same thing. You definitely said peter

1664
03:41:21,840 --> 03:41:24,200
I did not find it

1665
03:41:24,280 --> 03:41:26,680
You combined them. I definitely didn't

1666
03:41:27,629 --> 03:41:29,629
Yeah, i'll be proven wrong if I need to be

1667
03:41:30,030 --> 03:41:32,270
But that's a pretty good fun fact dr. Clay. Thank you

1668
03:41:32,909 --> 03:41:35,309
Yeah, it apparently was about three hours ago because

03:41:35,950 --> 03:41:38,989
That's when this bit message that but that's what dr. Clay wrote this

03:42:23,899 --> 03:42:29,520
Okay

Dark star 700 000 games. Thanks for the one dollar. Is your shirt collar trying to become a choker?

1681
03:42:34,559 --> 03:42:36,239
Yes, it is

1710
03:45:16,879 --> 03:45:29,549

fake e3 voice

03:45:56,110 --> 03:46:02,989
Don't get a blue switch. Yeah, I know there's like the cherry red and the the with the o rings. I know i've had them before

1716
03:46:03,709 --> 03:46:07,840
But i've dumped sodas and and like beers in them and like they're too much money

1717
03:46:08,239 --> 03:46:10,639
And i've come to the conclusion that I cannot be trusted with anything

1718
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:12,879
so

1719
03:46:12,879 --> 03:46:15,280

03:46:47,309 --> 03:46:50,590
The ones that just that's all you need. They don't need anything fancy

1725
03:46:50,670 --> 03:46:54,989
It just needs to have the letters on it and you press the letters and then that's all I need

1726
03:46:57,819 --> 03:47:00,459

1763
03:49:52,379 --> 03:49:57,049
And they redid the graphics

1764
03:49:57,129 --> 03:49:58,969

03:49:58,969 --> 03:50:00,090
maybe

1766
03:50:00,090 --> 03:50:02,090
We have gone back to that game a few times

1767
03:50:03,450 --> 03:50:07,850
And I don't know. I feel like trying to squeeze out the last remaining bits from that game

1768
03:50:09,239 --> 03:50:13,719
If there's enough there if there's actual a lot of content for the gardening then maybe i'll go back to it and do it again

uh sand draker for the one dollar

1774
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:43,260
Long time watcher first time caller. Have you thought about getting a p.o box that people can send stuff to

1775
03:50:43,819 --> 03:50:47,100
I imagine there's a lot of traditional fan art that people would love to send and share if not

1776
03:50:47,420 --> 03:50:49,739
It'd probably be motivating a lot of people to make some

1777
03:50:50,219 --> 03:50:54,860
There's a few streamers I watch that open their public p.o boxes every week and it's really entertaining

1778
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:58,139
Uh, love you and give auto a pet from me next time you see them

1779
03:50:59,479 --> 03:51:04,040
I have talked about this a couple times before and unfortunately I have to say no

1780
03:51:05,360 --> 03:51:07,840
P.o boxes because number one they have to be maintained

1781
03:51:09,100 --> 03:51:11,100
I can't i'm so

1782
03:51:11,340 --> 03:51:17,100
Scatterbrained you guys all know that that p.o box would fill up and I would get calls from the post office

1783
03:51:17,659 --> 03:51:20,860
Like can you fucking come down here and pick this shit up?

1784
03:51:22,090 --> 03:51:24,489
Um, whoa shit, right? Okay. Okay. Okay

1785
03:51:27,479 --> 03:51:31,879
and then also there's like the the chances that people send really fucked up stuff and

1786
03:51:33,920 --> 03:51:36,319
Uh, i've thought about it in the past before

1787
03:51:44,110 --> 03:51:47,229
People send terrible shit to yeah, I just

1788
03:51:48,590 --> 03:51:49,790
I mean if

1789
03:51:49,790 --> 03:51:53,950
For for some streamers in some communities like yeah, it's like a fun thing you do and I get it

1790
03:51:53,950 --> 03:51:55,950
I think it's that's like a funny interesting thing to do

1791
03:51:56,670 --> 03:51:58,750
But I am not like ready nor prepared

1792
03:51:59,389 --> 03:52:01,950
To like open up a box and have there be

1793
03:52:02,670 --> 03:52:04,510
Like throw up in it

1794
03:52:04,510 --> 03:52:08,829
Because i'll just be like uh, uh, and i'll like have to i'll have to leave the room and like end the stream

1795
03:52:17,500 --> 03:52:19,659
Yeah, maybe like one day

1796
03:52:21,360 --> 03:52:25,680
But no, I don't even want to like pretend like that would be a reality probably not

1797
03:52:28,219 --> 03:52:30,780
Your viewer base is very wholesome. I can't imagine that happening

1798
03:52:31,500 --> 03:52:33,100
I know but

1799
03:52:33,100 --> 03:52:36,059
Just don't want to have the opportunity for it to be a thing that could happen

1800
03:52:41,420 --> 03:52:44,620
Hold on to it though in the future. Maybe i'll lighten up a little bit about it

1801
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:48,559
But not now not now not me in the immediate future at all

1802
03:52:49,120 --> 03:53:03,629
But thank you for the one dollar sandrager. Appreciate it. It'd be like five people that actually send like blood

1803
03:53:04,909 --> 03:53:06,909
And ruin it for everybody else

1804
03:53:12,569 --> 03:53:15,370
Yeah, I made like a whole video about getting like blood in the mail

1805
03:53:15,450 --> 03:53:19,209
Are you trying to tell me that you don't think that five of those packages the first day would not be?

1806
03:53:20,489 --> 03:53:22,489
Like red liquid in a box

1807
03:53:23,680 --> 03:53:27,559
Come on now

1808
03:53:27,719 --> 03:53:34,479
Okay

Was I actually number one there

1813
03:53:58,489 --> 03:54:03,309
I think there are people that are spending lots of time and energy and effort on their

1814
03:54:04,110 --> 03:54:08,750
Pieces and artworks and stuff and then look at me like look at me. There's a hammer

1815
03:54:12,479 --> 03:54:14,479

1824
03:55:12,139 --> 03:55:15,659
Thank you, sweetie swanky for the one dollar story time when I was seven

1825
03:55:15,659 --> 03:55:19,819
I wanted my dad to make a bird house with me. It was a special time because he was never home

1826
03:55:20,459 --> 03:55:21,819
Being a truck driver

1827
03:55:21,819 --> 03:55:25,100
however, shortly after the bird house was finished, uh, a

1828
03:55:25,639 --> 03:55:31,020
Starling did try to go inside it but the hole was made too small and the bird's head got stuck

1829
03:55:31,579 --> 03:55:34,719
And couldn't get out

1830
03:55:34,719 --> 03:55:38,639
It's only until a week later that my dad had to throw away the bird house

1831
03:55:40,010 --> 03:55:45,290
With the body is still attached and vowed never to make anything with me again. Oh my god

1832
03:55:48,809 --> 03:55:50,809
That's fucking horrible

1833
03:55:53,930 --> 03:56:02,329
Oh no

1834
03:56:02,329 --> 03:56:04,329
No, that's so sad

1835
03:56:05,469 --> 03:56:07,790
Yeah, how do I like unread that story?

Well, i'm sorry to hear that. That's not that's that's terrible

1841
03:56:58,170 --> 03:57:02,799

How would you feel if you walked outside one day to check on the birdhouse and a full

1860
03:58:33,579 --> 03:58:37,420
Seagull was stuffed inside it like a looney toons character with its beak poking out the front

1861
03:58:39,770 --> 03:58:42,409
No, not right after that last story

1862
03:58:43,370 --> 03:58:48,489
No

1863
03:58:48,489 --> 03:58:52,809
You mean what you mean to say you mean the bird is in the house

1864
03:58:53,450 --> 03:59:00,219
Arms like the wings are sticking out the side beak out the front feet out of the bottom and he's pretending like he can't see me

1865
03:59:00,540 --> 03:59:02,909
And he doesn't think I can see him

1866
03:59:02,989 --> 03:59:08,239
That's the trope you're talking about

1867
03:59:08,319 --> 03:59:10,319
That I would first of all laugh

1868
03:59:11,290 --> 03:59:13,530
And then I would be like I would try to help the bird

1869
03:59:14,329 --> 03:59:16,329
By taking the top off

1870
03:59:16,780 --> 03:59:18,780
I would I would take the top off

1871
03:59:19,950 --> 03:59:22,090
And then the bird would

1872
03:59:22,090 --> 03:59:23,370
And get out

1873
03:59:23,370 --> 03:59:40,270
But this is the looney toons universe. So it would be all right, but thank you for the one dollar

04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:27,159
He doesn't pick up a controller and plug it in

2011
04:10:28,030 --> 04:10:32,930
And it was he wasn't even kidding and he only eats red and pink starbursts

2012
04:10:43,040 --> 04:10:45,379
Why does he only eat red starbursts

2013
04:10:48,719 --> 04:11:07,719
This guy's fucked

2014
04:11:07,719 --> 04:11:10,280
But for somebody like there's so much fucked up material

2015
04:11:11,739 --> 04:11:16,379
That would be actually embarrassing for me. It happened like two nights ago

2016
04:11:16,940 --> 04:11:19,819
when we were playing edf they're talking about like i'm naked and shit and

2017
04:11:20,459 --> 04:11:23,979
How like i'm an idiot and like it's embarrassing when i'm like naked

2018
04:11:24,860 --> 04:11:28,059
That like if that was on a roast that would be real and it would be actually embarrassing for me

2019
04:11:42,250 --> 04:11:45,850
You never responded about the art showcase. Oh shit. I'm sorry

2020
04:11:46,989 --> 04:11:48,430
Uh, yes

2021
04:11:48,430 --> 04:11:49,870
Yes, yes. Yes

2022
04:11:49,870 --> 04:11:52,430
I think something like that would be very fun

2023
04:11:52,510 --> 04:11:55,069
I know that there's a

2024
04:11:55,069 --> 04:11:57,069
there's a few uh streamers

2025
04:11:57,629 --> 04:12:02,110
That I know of and particularly that do art showcases and it seems really really cool really fun

2026
04:12:03,159 --> 04:12:06,520
Really great way to show off stuff from the community and i'm all about that

2027
04:12:08,000 --> 04:12:09,770
Just not immediately

2028
04:12:09,770 --> 04:12:11,819
Once we get to the new year

2029
04:12:11,819 --> 04:12:14,059
I'm going to sort out a few things to try

2030
04:12:16,440 --> 04:12:19,180
2019 i'm going to come up with a couple of things to do

2031
04:12:19,899 --> 04:12:24,200
For either the end of streams or once a week or once a month

2032
04:12:25,020 --> 04:12:26,780
That we just kind of hang out and do

2033
04:12:26,780 --> 04:12:35,340
Yeah, vinnie does it. Yeah, I think there's there's a few other people that know that actually that do like art streams

2034
04:12:36,409 --> 04:12:40,360
But yeah, Vinnie's been doing it and it's really really cool

2035
04:12:43,280 --> 04:12:45,280
But that's not something I would do

2036
04:12:46,430 --> 04:12:50,430
On like a day to day or a week to week basis. That would be something I'd want to do once in uh

2037
04:12:51,229 --> 04:12:53,389
You know, I feel like once like I said every month or two

2038
04:12:53,950 --> 04:13:02,360
Is it going to be a death of the memes on new year's eve?

2039
04:13:04,280 --> 04:13:08,159
Not this year they get to live

2040
04:13:08,159 --> 04:13:12,399
You saw what happened when I when I killed the memes. They just came back stronger obi-wan style

2041
04:13:20,170 --> 04:13:21,129
but

2042
04:13:21,129 --> 04:13:23,129
Thank you to why?

2043
04:13:23,690 --> 04:13:28,729
Am I small no, that's the will that's will I am small for the one dollar

2044
04:13:29,530 --> 04:13:31,770
When I visit vegas

2045
04:13:31,770 --> 04:13:34,729
Uh, I can invite you to my hotel room and you can piss in my shower

2046
04:13:35,979 --> 04:13:38,139
I will probably respectfully decline

2047
04:13:45,159 --> 04:13:52,559
Thank you. Uh will I am small for the one dollar and the invitation?

2048
04:13:54,190 --> 04:13:57,149
Hey syruk syruk. Thanks for the one dollar. Hello jerry

2049
04:13:57,229 --> 04:14:00,350
I have one question that will only take a minute to answer but you can spend as long as you need

2050
04:14:00,489 --> 04:14:02,489
Elaborating on the answer if you feel the need to

2051
04:14:02,909 --> 04:14:04,909
How have you avoided capture?

2052
04:14:04,989 --> 04:14:06,590

2053
04:14:06,590 --> 04:14:07,469

2054
04:14:07,469 --> 04:14:09,469
Yut da da da da last year

2055
04:14:12,750 --> 04:14:14,110

04:14:14,110 --> 04:14:16,159
I didn't do anything

2057
04:14:16,159 --> 04:14:19,200
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything

2058
04:14:22,809 --> 04:14:25,129
That's how because I didn't do anything

2059
04:14:39,959 --> 04:14:41,959
Vegas is a cover-up

2060
04:14:42,040 --> 04:14:46,329
Thank you for the one dollar, but I didn't do anything

2061
04:14:46,969 --> 04:14:52,360
Where are the pikachu socks?

2062
04:14:52,360 --> 04:14:54,360

04:14:57,049 --> 04:14:59,049

Thanks for the 50 cents and I read it. Why i'm i'm i'm breaking my own rules

2069
04:15:30,120 --> 04:15:33,079
But they say hashtag charity and you know, it's worth reading because it was for charity

2070
04:15:34,559 --> 04:15:41,200
Thank you serrano. Thank you will I am small again

2071

04:15:50,159 --> 04:15:53,120
Gotta go now, but enjoyed the stream. That was a long time ago

2074
04:15:54,909 --> 04:16:03,420
Holy shit

2075
04:16:03,420 --> 04:16:05,420
The tommy slov tutorial

2076
04:16:07,719 --> 04:16:12,860
Wow, thank you. I'm being corrected here. It's william

2086
04:16:59,600 --> 04:17:02,989
I just saw it pop up on the screen

2087
04:17:03,049 --> 04:17:06,250
Hashtag charities

2088
04:17:06,250 --> 04:17:08,569
If you want to include it in that

2089
04:17:08,569 --> 04:17:16,190
Which that's awesome. That's a lot of money. But anyways, uh, thank you. Dr. Clay

2090
04:17:17,149 --> 04:17:18,670
For the one dollar you're the only streamer

2091
04:17:18,670 --> 04:17:21,629
I know if we can build a birdhouse on stream and make it watchable still

2092
04:17:22,440 --> 04:17:29,319
Take care. Hashtag charity. Well watchable or not. It was something I was going to do

2093
04:17:33,549 --> 04:17:35,549
And I don't know. I kind of had fun

2094
04:17:35,549 --> 04:17:42,719
That was fun for me

2095
04:17:42,719 --> 04:17:45,149
In quotes watchable

2096
04:17:45,870 --> 04:17:47,870
You you bastard

2097
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:51,159
Uh s dog man. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey germa

2098
04:17:51,719 --> 04:17:57,079
If you ever did a holiday if you ever did a holiday to australia, would you consider aligning it with a con of some kind?

2099
04:17:57,559 --> 04:17:59,959
So we could meet our esteemed streamer

2100
04:18:00,760 --> 04:18:02,739
I wanted to donate

2101
04:18:02,739 --> 04:18:07,379
5,000 last time but 5,000 bits costs over a hundred fucking dollars

2102
04:18:08,260 --> 04:18:10,579
You deserve it. You're an idol to me and many more. I love you, man

2103
04:18:12,870 --> 04:18:15,350
Holy shit. Why is it? Why is that so much money?

2104
04:18:17,659 --> 04:18:20,459
Why is 5,000 bits over a hundred dollars?

2105
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:28,549
in australia

2106
04:18:28,549 --> 04:18:33,030
That's an insane

2107
04:18:33,030 --> 04:18:37,350
That's an exchange. That's the exchange rate and like the tax that's fucked up

2108
04:18:45,190 --> 04:18:47,190
but anyways, um

2109
04:18:47,670 --> 04:18:49,670
Yeah, don't worry about that. Don't worry about

2110
04:18:49,909 --> 04:18:52,469
Wanting to give me like a hundred dollars or fifty dollars

2111
04:18:56,250 --> 04:19:01,159
That's not important

2112
04:19:01,159 --> 04:19:03,159
Thank you for even considering it

2113
04:19:04,340 --> 04:19:09,190
But yeah, if I ever decide I mean australia that's a long ways away

2114
04:19:10,979 --> 04:19:12,979
australia is

2115
04:19:13,000 --> 04:19:16,120
That's a trip. That's like a two week long trip

2116
04:19:18,360 --> 04:19:23,319
You can't really just go to australia. Yeah, I live in the u.s. Let's just go to australia for a few days

2117
04:19:23,799 --> 04:19:25,799
I would want to spend at least a couple weeks there

2118
04:19:25,959 --> 04:19:34,680
Maybe one day but if I was going to go there it would have to be for

2119
04:19:35,239 --> 04:19:38,440
I'd want to line it up with at least a couple of particular reasons why I would go

2120
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:45,819
Three months in a balloon

2121
04:19:45,819 --> 04:19:47,260
But thank you

2122
04:19:47,260 --> 04:19:49,770
That's dog man. Appreciate it

2123
04:19:49,770 --> 04:19:55,500
Maybe one day i'll make my way over to australia. Let's put it on the list

2124
04:19:58,120 --> 04:20:01,959
Agent pigeon. Thanks for the one dollar. I love you germa if you could please tell this girl

2125
04:20:03,459 --> 04:20:05,540
No, i'm not doing that. What?

2126
04:20:06,870 --> 04:20:10,870
Also eat my i'm not i'm not naming these two people

2127
04:20:16,739 --> 04:20:20,899
Thank you s dog man again for the one dollar. Oh, also I use fl studio a lot

2128
04:20:21,899 --> 04:20:25,819
If you need help getting the hang of things message me on the discord or something would love to be able to contribute

2129
04:20:27,739 --> 04:20:31,879
Yeah, there's a lot of talented fucking people and I definitely would

2130
04:20:32,440 --> 04:20:34,520
Before that stream i'd probably hop into a channel

2131
04:20:35,959 --> 04:20:37,959
There's also like I want to make a game

2132
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:45,510
Design channel on the discord eventually here because I want to see how many people are interested and how many people uh,

2133
04:20:46,069 --> 04:20:52,940
Because i've seen people making games i've seen at least two instances three instances of people making

2134
04:20:54,069 --> 04:20:57,930
playable video games and it's it's fucking really cool, so

2135
04:21:00,569 --> 04:21:02,569
It would be nice to have a place

2136
04:21:02,569 --> 04:21:10,809
For that and somewhere down the line. I would love to I don't know

2137
04:21:12,010 --> 04:21:13,610
I always have trouble

2138
04:21:13,610 --> 04:21:16,090
Saying stuff like this because it's not necessarily true

2139
04:21:16,409 --> 04:21:21,079
But I have a lot of things that i'd like to do a lot of things that interest me have a lot

2140
04:21:21,079 --> 04:21:23,079
Of ideas that i'd like to try to have happen

2141
04:21:23,829 --> 04:21:29,030
Now how many of these things are realities right you watch you watched me over the course of four years

2142
04:21:29,590 --> 04:21:32,149
Talk about how badly I wanted to write something write a book

2143
04:21:33,350 --> 04:21:37,670
I started it. I tried it and every few months i'd be like, yeah i'm trying

2144
04:21:38,149 --> 04:21:42,389
And then like a year went by and it's like I I don't think I can do this and then like a year ago

2145
04:21:42,389 --> 04:21:46,299
It was like um, that's never gonna happen. So

2146
04:21:47,180 --> 04:21:51,579
I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to be like hey, uh, yeah

2147
04:21:51,659 --> 04:21:56,379
So i'll see you like next year when there's a video game that's released and that I made

2148
04:21:58,659 --> 04:22:09,219
These are ideas that I just want to see if they're possible, but the channel

2149
04:22:10,360 --> 04:22:11,959
on the discord

2150
04:22:11,959 --> 04:22:13,959
Would mainly just be for just general

2151
04:22:14,520 --> 04:22:16,840
game dev talk because a lot of you guys are interested in it, too

2152
04:22:17,879 --> 04:22:19,479
You know, it's not just

2153
04:22:19,479 --> 04:22:22,760
Me that eventually that'd be fun to make a game at some point. Wouldn't it?

2154
04:22:23,239 --> 04:22:26,040
Wouldn't that be like fun to do in like a few years or something, right?

2155
04:22:27,590 --> 04:22:29,590
The bullet hell thing was a game

2156
04:22:29,750 --> 04:22:32,440
There's somebody else working on another game

2157
04:22:33,799 --> 04:22:37,719
Somebody put like made a whole mugen template for me. There's a lot of you guys that are interested

2158
04:22:37,879 --> 04:22:39,399
So it might be fun to do

2159
04:22:39,399 --> 04:22:41,399
To have like a place where you could go talk about it

2160
04:22:47,899 --> 04:22:50,440
But yeah

2161
04:22:50,440 --> 04:22:52,440
Uh getting close to the end here

2162
04:22:57,370 --> 04:23:00,569
Thank you dinky duper for the one dollar. Hey, did you see that jeremy guy on twitch?

2163
04:23:00,569 --> 04:23:03,370
Yeah, man, he went ballistic over a bird house. What a boomer

2164
04:23:03,770 --> 04:23:08,489
He started smashing stuff and then sniffed a whole jar of paint and pooped a blood vessel

2165
04:23:08,889 --> 04:23:12,329
It still doesn't live up to bill crazy though. I mean, how are you gonna beat him?

2166
04:23:13,270 --> 04:23:15,270
Thank you kairatobi for the one dollar

2167
04:23:15,270 --> 04:23:17,750
Uh rats rats with rats

2168
04:23:18,469 --> 04:23:20,469
Celebrating it another milestone bash

2169
04:23:22,219 --> 04:23:24,219
jeremy 200k this week

Although that would kind of be kind of good

2222
04:28:01,750 --> 04:28:06,790
I am not even fucking kidding. I think I would want to use those

2223
04:28:08,709 --> 04:28:12,790

I don't like face cam. I don't like having face cam on

2258
04:30:57,059 --> 04:31:00,600
Because i'm a fucking weirdo

Maybe we'll do it again and we probably will because i've already seen at least a dozen

2335
04:36:45,340 --> 04:36:47,979
That were not on the movie night that were very very good

2336
04:36:50,299 --> 04:36:52,919
Just do it every couple of months

2337
04:36:52,919 --> 04:36:55,880
Yeah, but if we were gonna do it every couple months i'd want to give more material

2338
04:36:56,360 --> 04:36:59,560
because there's only so much you can do with like

2339
04:37:00,439 --> 04:37:06,250
Like a fucking raptor I would need to do more if it's gonna be a regular thing

2340
04:37:16,250 --> 04:37:18,650
Kiwo up to upload of like six already

2341
04:37:26,220 --> 04:37:29,540
That's so funny

2342
04:37:30,740 --> 04:37:33,189
Six

2343
04:37:33,189 --> 04:37:37,369
I actually saw I I actually saw one on twitter. It was fucking funny

2344
04:37:38,009 --> 04:37:44,659
But if I was gonna do more of that, I would want to do more

2345
04:37:46,650 --> 04:37:48,650
So maybe I would do another green screen

2346
04:37:49,509 --> 04:37:51,479
appearance

2347
04:37:51,479 --> 04:37:59,819
Like the green screen bonus pack one thing at a time. I got this christmas stream that I need to get ready

2348
04:38:00,459 --> 04:38:02,459
And one one step at a time

2349
04:38:04,180 --> 04:38:08,919
green screen dlc

2350
04:38:08,919 --> 04:38:14,520
But hopefully that answers your question dark prime. We will probably see it very soon

2351
04:38:15,000 --> 04:38:19,909
Hey superintendent chalmers. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey jeremy. How many bars of soap have you stolen from hotels?

2352
04:38:20,630 --> 04:38:27,020
I know it's a lot hashtag charity. There's no such thing as stealing soap from a hotel. It's free

2353
04:38:28,310 --> 04:38:30,549
They put a bar of soap in there for you to use it and take it

2354
04:38:32,840 --> 04:38:36,549
You're supposed to use that. So

2355
04:38:36,549 --> 04:38:41,270
Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar and here is you doing it last stream. I got proof right here

2356
04:38:45,130 --> 04:38:47,430
Hey, uh beater

2357
04:38:51,830 --> 04:38:54,490
Nobody said it

2358
04:38:54,490 --> 04:38:58,580
Hey, uh, can I go one stream without doing that?

2359
04:38:59,669 --> 04:39:03,430
You said it, but I didn't say it everywhere's closed. I just there's no food

2360
04:39:06,619 --> 04:39:08,619
Okay, i'm not allowed to say that tomorrow

2361
04:39:10,330 --> 04:39:16,569
Whisper it well, i'm doing hotline miami too tomorrow. I'm not allowed to say beater tomorrow call me out on it if I do

2362
04:39:17,049 --> 04:39:20,889
Because i'm not going to

2363
04:39:20,889 --> 04:39:26,250
Hey, thank you marty 20k again for one dollar hashtag charity. Uh forgot. I forgot what to say

2364
04:39:26,810 --> 04:39:29,799
Oh, man

2365
04:39:29,799 --> 04:39:32,439

2366
04:39:32,439 --> 04:39:34,279
uh, thank you

2367
04:39:34,279 --> 04:39:36,279
Isner for the ten dollars

2368
04:39:37,799 --> 04:39:41,720
Thank you so much for the ten dollars here. I'll never be the one guy if I only lurk

2369
04:39:42,439 --> 04:39:44,439
Checkmate jeremy. Oh and hashtag charity

2370
04:39:48,619 --> 04:39:51,659
And never be the one guy if you lurk. Well, you have to be the one guy

2371
04:39:52,459 --> 04:39:56,740
You have to be if to say something

2372
04:39:56,740 --> 04:40:00,340
But thank you for the ten dollars and thank you for that putting the hashtag charity there as well

2373
04:40:01,060 --> 04:40:03,290
Thank you

2374
04:40:03,290 --> 04:40:07,689
Dark prime again for five dollars. Thank you. I appreciate your streams. Would you care to check out the green screen video?

2375
04:40:08,330 --> 04:40:10,490
I think you might maybe it didn't go through the first time

2376
04:40:11,130 --> 04:40:13,430
Maybe that's ten dollars total here

2377
04:40:14,659 --> 04:40:19,299
Uh, I was late to the party, but I think you'd love it. Hashtag charity. Thank you for putting the hashtag charity there

2378
04:40:19,700 --> 04:40:22,099
Hopefully I answered your question. Hopefully you're still here

2379
04:40:23,259 --> 04:40:27,259
Uh, hold on to that because we will probably put it into a small compilation

2380
04:40:30,409 --> 04:40:32,409
On green screen encore night

2381
04:40:33,049 --> 04:40:36,729
At the end of another stream at some point over the next probably the early 2019

2382
04:40:37,529 --> 04:40:39,529
after the christmas stream

2383
04:40:39,529 --> 04:40:42,729
because that gives some more time for people to get some and we'll do another little thing and

2384
04:40:43,369 --> 04:40:51,380
You hang on to that. Thank you. S dog man again for the one dollar on the bits thing. Yeah

2385
04:40:51,919 --> 04:40:53,860
a udt usd

2386
04:40:53,860 --> 04:40:56,659
Plus gst and I guess there's the online tax

2387
04:40:57,680 --> 04:41:02,099
Entertainment tax shit. Yeah, it's an it's an around the world thing traveling here

2388
04:41:02,180 --> 04:41:05,700
I've wanted to go to america, but likewise, it's a big commitment to make and a lot of travel

2389
04:41:08,279 --> 04:41:09,479
Yeah

2390
04:41:09,479 --> 04:41:11,479
Travels hard no matter how far you go

2391
04:41:12,310 --> 04:41:14,200
You go

2392
04:41:14,200 --> 04:41:15,770
an hour

2393
04:41:15,770 --> 04:41:17,770
You know to another state

2394
04:41:17,770 --> 04:41:19,430
You go

2395
04:41:19,430 --> 04:41:24,790
Yeah, i'm going. Uh, i'm gonna go up to i'm gonna go to maine for the weekend, right?

2396
04:41:24,790 --> 04:41:31,959
When I was in massachusetts, that's like a four-hour drive and that like that sucks. It's a long way so

2397
04:41:33,659 --> 04:41:36,459
Any type of travel is stressful, especially going that far

2398
04:41:37,580 --> 04:41:40,619
Five minutes to mcdonald's. Yeah, it's like it's fucking a lot

2399
04:41:42,659 --> 04:41:44,659
I can't mcdonald's just deliver

2400
04:41:50,040 --> 04:41:54,439
but yeah, and it's if you get like on an airplane or you travel by boat or

2401
04:41:55,740 --> 04:41:57,740
More than four or five hours in a car

2402
04:41:58,380 --> 04:42:02,950
It's always a pain in the ass

2403
04:42:02,950 --> 04:42:07,340
Yeah, maybe one day you'll come over

2404
04:42:07,340 --> 04:42:09,340
uber rats what?

2405
04:42:13,049 --> 04:42:17,290
Thank you marty20k again for two dollars. Hey germa985. Where's the ocean?

2406
04:42:17,930 --> 04:42:19,290
the deepest

2407
04:42:19,290 --> 04:42:22,310
At the bottom

2408
04:42:22,310 --> 04:42:24,869
I threw up. I just puked because I read that

2409
04:42:26,650 --> 04:42:31,049
Hey novi, thanks for the one dollar. Congrats on the 200 000 germamites. Hashtag charity. Thank you

2410
04:42:34,360 --> 04:42:42,119
200 000 of you guys timmy tim tan thanks for the one dollar i'm running out of these daily tv videos

2411
04:42:42,360 --> 04:42:44,680
I think are funny very quickly

2412
04:42:45,400 --> 04:42:52,040
I'm running out of these. I love how you can run out of them

2413
04:42:52,520 --> 04:42:54,680
Like you've had a supply rules, too

2414
04:42:56,119 --> 04:43:00,279
Excuse me. May I see your license? I'm afraid i've left it at home

2415
04:43:00,759 --> 04:43:04,439
In that case, you'll have to take it to the police station within five days

2416
04:43:04,919 --> 04:43:08,919
But why you were speeding ma'am, but I was only doing 75

2417
04:43:09,240 --> 04:43:14,119
There's a 70 kilometer hour speed limit on this road ma'am. Is there I didn't see a sign

2418
04:43:14,520 --> 04:43:19,000
Well, ma'am, we've been following you so you were doing 75 too

2419
04:43:19,639 --> 04:43:23,720
No, ma'am, we were doing 90 kilometers an hour and we couldn't catch you

2420
04:43:25,080 --> 04:43:28,439
Wait traffic 90 kilometers an hour. Isn't that like

2421
04:43:29,560 --> 04:43:32,840
That's like 30 miles per hour. Well, isn't it like 40 miles per hour?

2422
04:43:40,490 --> 04:43:44,569
Boomer can't do math. I don't work in kilometers. I don't work in kilometers

2423
04:43:46,619 --> 04:43:48,700
I work in miles per hour

2424
04:43:54,700 --> 04:43:57,740
Thank you timmy tim tan. Thank you chubby funster for the one dollar. Hey germy you make me laugh

2425
04:43:57,740 --> 04:43:59,419
So I guess you're funny or something

2426
04:43:59,419 --> 04:44:05,580
Trug uh, jess for confirmation your fursona would be a rat, right? I'm sure you'll answer this and not laugh nervously and move on

2427
04:44:06,060 --> 04:44:08,060
from it, uh

2428
04:44:08,139 --> 04:44:10,299
No, hashtag charity. No, my fursona would be

2429
04:44:11,500 --> 04:44:17,259
If I were to have one like an alternate look there's a haven't you seen that spider-man movie where they're all different spider-mans from different spider-man universes

2430
04:44:17,580 --> 04:44:19,340
There's a bunch of you already

2431
04:44:19,340 --> 04:44:22,619
The one germa that is a in a fursuit right now somewhere

2432
04:44:23,340 --> 04:44:25,340
That exists in some alternate timeline

2433
04:44:25,979 --> 04:44:27,500
Is probably

2434
04:44:27,500 --> 04:44:39,369
In a big slippy toad costume this one. No, not this one

2435
04:44:44,919 --> 04:44:46,439
or uh

2436
04:44:46,439 --> 04:44:49,340
I was gonna say goblin

2437
04:44:49,340 --> 04:44:54,919
But that's not a that's not an animal. That is a mythical creature

2438
04:44:55,400 --> 04:44:59,290
Can a goblin be a fursona?

2439
04:44:59,369 --> 04:45:04,330
It can right like a goblin is is that that's that's technically like an otherworldly mythical animal

2440
04:45:16,180 --> 04:45:18,700
Goblins don't have fur

2441
04:45:18,700 --> 04:45:19,979
Who cares?

2442
04:45:19,979 --> 04:45:26,549
Well, that's yeah, that's that's two different alternate timelines

2443
04:45:27,189 --> 04:45:29,189
one of them's a frog one of them's a

2444
04:45:29,590 --> 04:45:31,590
A toad and one of them is a rat

2445
04:45:31,750 --> 04:45:33,909
One of them's a goblin

2446
04:45:33,909 --> 04:45:35,909
One of them is a wolf

2447
04:45:37,290 --> 04:45:41,689
And then in this timeline, it's uh, it's a a leopard so

2448
04:45:48,099 --> 04:45:54,810
Whatever. Okay

2449
04:45:59,080 --> 04:46:07,479
I really gotta like put this to bed one of them is one of them's a human it's this one

2450
04:46:12,779 --> 04:46:14,779
Thank you moist n

2451
04:46:14,779 --> 04:46:17,580

2456
04:46:34,729 --> 04:46:38,119
If you like it, then you do thank you

2457

04:46:43,299 --> 04:46:47,580
Socks rocked confirmed. Hey demonic cucumber. Thanks for the one dollar

2460
04:46:47,580 --> 04:46:51,020
If you don't title the gamer gear stream the bionic boomer

2461
04:46:57,939 --> 04:47:04,580
It's the bionic boomer i'm gonna get one of those eye trackers and track the screen and shit

2462
04:47:05,299 --> 04:47:08,099
I'm gonna be so plugged in there's gonna be so many cords all over me

2463
04:47:10,919 --> 04:47:13,740
Boomer

2464
04:47:15,979 --> 04:47:17,979
I'm gonna look so shitty too

2465
04:47:18,619 --> 04:47:21,500
A heartbeat sensor i'm gonna oh my god

2466
04:47:22,139 --> 04:47:25,979
Don't tell me to do all this. I'm gonna do this like soon

2467
04:47:27,479 --> 04:47:30,680
I'm gonna get so much fucked up shit. I'm gonna get like a virtual boy

2468
04:47:35,479 --> 04:47:39,720
I'm gonna take my blood sugar in the middle of the stream. Although I don't think I can do that

2469
04:47:41,540 --> 04:47:44,819
Can I like take my can I like read my blood sugar in the middle of the stream?

2470
04:47:44,900 --> 04:47:47,540
I don't think i'm I don't think i'd be allowed to do that. That like breaks t. O. S

2471
04:47:55,590 --> 04:47:57,590
What if it was really fucking bad

2472
04:48:01,209 --> 04:48:03,209
Oh by the look it's been long enough

2473
04:48:03,450 --> 04:48:07,130
Can I tell you guys the the thing that I that i'm so pissed off that I didn't get a chance to do

2474
04:48:08,229 --> 04:48:10,229
During the lie detector stream

2475
04:48:10,939 --> 04:48:13,180
So I purchased a bunch of medical shit

2476
04:48:14,340 --> 04:48:17,619
I've bought one of those blood spinning machines

2477
04:48:18,580 --> 04:48:20,819
One of those things where you put all the blood tubes in and it

2478
04:48:24,470 --> 04:48:26,630
I purchased one. I actually fucking bought one

2479
04:48:27,900 --> 04:48:34,069
And the thing I was gonna do is I was going this is too bad. I'm so sad that this didn't happen

2480
04:48:34,790 --> 04:48:37,909
But we were gonna do an elaborate thing me and the doctor

2481
04:48:38,549 --> 04:48:40,549
where every question

2482
04:48:40,630 --> 04:48:45,270
Instead of just asking a question and then like reading and saying oh that was a lie. That wasn't a lie

2483
04:48:46,229 --> 04:48:48,630
He was gonna take up he's gonna drop blood from me

2484
04:48:49,669 --> 04:48:51,189
every question

2485
04:48:51,189 --> 04:48:53,590
So he's gonna ask a question and then draw blood

2486
04:48:54,150 --> 04:48:58,869
Put it in the spinning machine and then put it under a microscope and then determine if it was a lie

2487
04:48:59,590 --> 04:49:05,509
And the whole joke was over the course of the stream. I was gonna be losing so much blood that like okay

2488
04:49:05,509 --> 04:49:08,549
Yeah, it takes a while. We're gonna do like 20 30 questions

2489
04:49:10,700 --> 04:49:15,659
And at the I was gonna like go get like water and come back with like like blue skin

2490
04:49:16,619 --> 04:49:20,299
Like I was getting I was draining all my blood and then I realized

2491
04:49:21,259 --> 04:49:24,060
Um, that's like breaks a lot of rules here

2492
04:49:28,599 --> 04:49:32,759
That would be like I bought like a like a fake syringes and shit and I'm like wait

2493
04:49:32,759 --> 04:49:34,759
I don't I can't do that

2494
04:49:35,020 --> 04:49:42,970
I don't think I can do that

2495
04:49:42,970 --> 04:49:45,930
but I was like laughing my ass off about it me and uh

2496
04:49:46,970 --> 04:49:49,369
The guy that helps me do most of the videos and stuff

2497
04:49:50,090 --> 04:49:51,529
We were just like

2498
04:49:51,529 --> 04:49:53,930
Oh, and the doctor was gonna look up every now and again

2499
04:49:54,250 --> 04:49:59,770
He's gonna look through the microscope and be like, ah, this is the most full of shit blood i've ever seen in my life

2500
04:50:01,720 --> 04:50:04,919
Like how why would you need that to determine if it's a lie or not?

2501
04:50:09,139 --> 04:50:11,139
There you go. There's that's uh

2502
04:50:11,299 --> 04:50:15,860
There's some insight on on that stream. I couldn't do the

2503
04:50:16,580 --> 04:50:20,580
draw blood from me until I like am fucking turning into

2504
04:50:21,380 --> 04:50:23,060
like I was gonna be like

2505
04:50:23,139 --> 04:50:27,939
Falling asleep and shit and he's gonna be like waking me up to ask more questions and draw more blood

2506
04:50:29,939 --> 04:50:32,979
And then we were like, no, I think that might I think that's a little too much

2507
04:50:33,619 --> 04:50:44,950
I'm gonna need a piss sample

2508
04:50:45,509 --> 04:50:54,540
Because we were trying to think of like ways that if you took a lie detector

2509
04:50:56,200 --> 04:50:58,200
What would you not ever have to do?

2510
04:51:03,979 --> 04:51:08,619
But yeah, that was that was part of one of the ideas that just never ended up and I still I fucking

2511
04:51:08,619 --> 04:51:10,790
Had the machine up until I moved

2512
04:51:10,869 --> 04:51:14,150
I was trying to think about some another way to use that machine

2513
04:51:14,709 --> 04:51:16,709
And I couldn't it was just not enough time

2514
04:51:25,990 --> 04:51:29,669
No, he wasn't really gonna be drawing any blood from me. It was gonna be all fake

2515
04:51:40,939 --> 04:51:45,419
How much did it cost? It wasn't that expensive because I don't know somebody was like getting rid of it weirdly enough

2516
04:51:52,020 --> 04:51:54,020
Bionic boomer we have the technology

2517
04:51:56,619 --> 04:51:59,819
Yeah, now that I think about it. What the fuck was all that shit?

2518
04:52:05,779 --> 04:52:09,700
How much was it? I I I I I can't say

2519
04:52:10,500 --> 04:52:12,840
I can't say

2520
04:52:12,840 --> 04:52:15,110
What can I say?

2521
04:52:15,110 --> 04:52:19,830
I don't still have it. I'm not gonna look there was only a certain amount of stuff I could put

2522
04:52:20,630 --> 04:52:22,950
In and when I when I moved right?

2523
04:52:23,669 --> 04:52:26,069
So when I was like stuffing up boxes and shit

2524
04:52:26,630 --> 04:52:31,509
The big spinning blood machine is not something that it was a priority to bring to vegas

2525
04:52:38,500 --> 04:52:40,569
How do you come up with this stuff?

2526
04:52:40,569 --> 04:52:45,880
I don't know

2527
04:52:45,880 --> 04:52:49,560
You still took the machinima shot glass. Um, excuse me

2528
04:52:50,279 --> 04:52:53,240
Uh, the machinima shot glass is like an inch tall

2529
04:52:54,250 --> 04:53:02,009
The blood machine was a fucking huge machine. It was giant. It was a big heavy clunky machine that made a loud noise

2530
04:53:08,860 --> 04:53:14,090
All right. Let's finish this up

2531
04:53:14,090 --> 04:53:16,970
But uh look forward. I look forward to the bionic boomer stream

2532
04:53:19,080 --> 04:53:21,369
Put it on the list

2533
04:53:21,369 --> 04:53:27,939
Thank you. Uh, lulamore for the one dollar found you on your old layers of fear youtube stream

2534
04:53:28,500 --> 04:53:30,900
Where you were dying laughing when the baby was hitting the wall

2535
04:53:31,540 --> 04:53:34,819
Been hooked on hooked on you since love you stuff. You always make my day

2536
04:53:34,819 --> 04:53:38,340
I hope you're well and merry whatever is you celebrate. Thank you

2537
04:53:45,990 --> 04:53:50,470
That was the hardest that was one of the hardest composers i've ever had to because that had a face cam on

2538
04:53:51,270 --> 04:53:54,310
I was desperately trying to keep my cool and not look like a weirdo

2539
04:53:55,110 --> 04:53:57,669
But how do you keep your cool when something like that's happening? I don't know

2540
04:54:02,950 --> 04:54:04,950
Back when I had short hair. Yeah

2541
04:54:10,700 --> 04:54:13,509
But thank you lulamore, uh

2542
04:54:14,459 --> 04:54:16,229
Right back at you as well

2543
04:54:16,229 --> 04:54:17,349
whatever, uh

2544
04:54:17,349 --> 04:54:19,349
Merry whatever is whatever you celebrate

2545
04:54:20,470 --> 04:54:26,069
Thank you. All right. Only a few more extra cheesy. Thanks for the one dollar. You could wear these with the pants

2546
04:54:27,939 --> 04:54:29,939
uh mouse belt buckle

2547
04:54:33,290 --> 04:54:35,290
Hello, why is there?

2548
04:54:35,770 --> 04:54:40,729
A craziest gadgets dot com. What the fuck is that dumb website?

2549
04:54:43,930 --> 04:54:47,770
Well, is this is that website just the in the back of the seat on an airplane?

2550
04:54:50,200 --> 04:54:54,119
Like that mall whatever it is like the weird shit that that used to be in the mall

2551
04:54:56,740 --> 04:54:59,220
Not the mall in the in the back of an airplane

2552
04:55:00,819 --> 04:55:08,740
The sky mall

2553
04:55:08,740 --> 04:55:11,060
It's going to be all it is going to be a joke

2554
04:55:11,779 --> 04:55:14,180
If you think that the birdhouse stream was just like oh he

2555
04:55:14,900 --> 04:55:18,740
So like somebody said look at these pants and hey build a birdhouse

2556
04:55:19,220 --> 04:55:21,400
This is gonna i'm taking this to 100 now

2557
04:55:22,619 --> 04:55:26,139
The bionic boomer is going to it's gonna happen and i'm going to be decked out

2558
04:55:26,779 --> 04:55:27,819
head

2559
04:55:27,819 --> 04:55:29,020
To toe

2560
04:55:29,020 --> 04:55:33,900
There's not going to be a fucking inch of my body that does not have a peripheral attached to it

2561
04:55:34,220 --> 04:55:36,220
It's gonna take hours to go through them all

2562
04:55:43,159 --> 04:55:45,159
bionic boomer

2563
04:55:47,259 --> 04:55:53,419
I'm gonna attach you know those little claws those like robotic hands like those things that you can reach up like grandma users to grab

2564
04:55:53,500 --> 04:55:54,700
stuff

2565
04:55:54,700 --> 04:55:56,700
We're gonna like pour a drink

2566
04:55:57,209 --> 04:56:00,090
I'm gonna have a robot on me like moving an arm and shit

2567
04:56:15,060 --> 04:56:17,299
Oh spill drink joke incoming

2568
04:56:20,419 --> 04:56:22,419
You're gonna spill a drink

2569
04:56:25,049 --> 04:56:29,590
Not on this desk

2570
04:56:31,580 --> 04:56:33,340
I love this so much

2571
04:56:33,340 --> 04:56:36,040
But thank you extra cheesy for the belt buckle

2572
04:56:36,040 --> 04:56:40,360
Thank you marty20k for the five bucks hearing you read my messages is making me regret

2573
04:56:40,919 --> 04:56:42,919
Giving bits while drunk

2574
04:56:42,919 --> 04:56:44,919
Sorry, and thank you. All right. That's it up

2575
04:56:45,540 --> 04:56:48,060
No more bits

2576
04:56:48,060 --> 04:56:50,139
Uh, no more bits anyways because the stream is pretty much over

2577
04:56:50,860 --> 04:56:53,259
But thank you marty20k for the five dollars

2578
04:56:54,299 --> 04:57:01,959
And no more drunk bits. Okay, if you spill a drink on the bionic boomer, he dies

2579
04:57:05,720 --> 04:57:07,799
I actually want it to be hard to move

2580
04:57:09,049 --> 04:57:11,049
Is it gonna take like i'm gonna need help here

2581
04:57:11,770 --> 04:57:16,569
I'm going to make an elaborate suit that is going to be physically difficult for me to actually move

2582
04:57:19,130 --> 04:57:21,130
It's gonna it's gonna be very hard

2583
04:57:27,130 --> 04:57:31,369
Thank you, uh wind thank you wind windar for the one dollar

2584
04:57:32,009 --> 04:57:35,770
If we do a movie night encore will there be limitations on what we watch?

2585
04:57:36,409 --> 04:57:42,409
Like is it possible to avoid 15 to 20 vids of jojo stuff? They're fun to watch but they took up a lot of

2586
04:57:42,970 --> 04:57:45,659
uh the first movie night

2587
04:57:45,900 --> 04:57:48,069
I would probably say

2588
04:57:48,069 --> 04:57:49,750
It would be

2589
04:57:49,750 --> 04:57:51,990
um

2590
04:57:51,990 --> 04:57:53,509
I don't know. I don't know

2591
04:57:53,509 --> 04:57:55,909
I can't really I can't say

2592
04:57:57,110 --> 04:57:58,599
because

2593
04:57:58,599 --> 04:58:01,400
I haven't thought too much about it until right now

2594
04:58:02,139 --> 04:58:07,340
So I don't want to give rules and guidelines on something that I haven't even personally thought about yet. So

2595
04:58:10,229 --> 04:58:14,630
Uh, we'll talk about that at a later date when I can get a more clear idea of what I would like to do

2596
04:58:17,540 --> 04:58:19,610
But we'll see

2597
04:58:19,610 --> 04:58:21,130
and then finally, uh

2598
04:58:21,209 --> 04:58:25,930
Solomon the squid thanks for the two dollars. Hey, germa love the stream was wondering if you ever had made progress on that book

2599
04:58:26,009 --> 04:58:27,990
You said you were writing it you're back

2600
04:58:27,990 --> 04:58:31,930
It's no big deal to me if you decided to cut it all together or put it on hold

2601
04:58:33,209 --> 04:58:39,909
Uh, I just wanted to know if there was any cool details you'd like to share on it. Well

2602
04:58:40,869 --> 04:58:42,439
uh

2603
04:58:42,439 --> 04:58:45,459
I actually uh, i've talked about the book

2604
04:58:46,979 --> 04:58:51,220
Not only tonight, but I put the can on it probably like a year or two ago

2605
04:58:52,549 --> 04:58:58,299
Remember we were streaming. I don't know what we were playing but I like actually put the nail in the coffin

2606
04:58:59,000 --> 04:59:08,779
Like a couple years ago, didn't I it was gonna be a choose your own adventure book of rote with this engine that I was

2607
04:59:09,180 --> 04:59:17,610
Learning tell this the end of the book now that it's dead. How far did it get?

2608
04:59:18,630 --> 04:59:24,580
I didn't I copy and pasted like a bunch of shit in here. Remember that was how long how many you guys were here

2609
04:59:24,659 --> 04:59:27,159
For that I copy and pasted

2610
04:59:27,639 --> 04:59:35,990
Probably like 1500 words in here. Was it twine? It was not twine. It was the it was the ink

2611
04:59:36,709 --> 04:59:37,750
the

2612
04:59:37,750 --> 04:59:55,610
Inkling writer, no, they were not inkling the ink ankle ankle writer. What is this? What are you guys doing?

2613
05:00:00,840 --> 05:00:05,560
Weren't there like a dozen pages that got pasted? Yeah, I just like copy and pasted all the shit that was there

2614
05:00:07,560 --> 05:00:12,810
Oh, okay

2615
05:00:12,810 --> 05:00:18,090
But that's it talked about it. I i'm surprised that people were asking about it

2616
05:00:18,650 --> 05:00:20,889
Was anybody asking about it? Did I just go off?

2617
05:00:21,860 --> 05:00:25,299
Because I thought I did kind of put the nail in it like a year or two ago

2618
05:00:27,909 --> 05:00:38,779
When I copy and pasted everything because we like your stuff. Oh, okay

2619
05:00:39,340 --> 05:00:48,119
It was a lot of fun to try to make but here's the next part of this that needs to be addressed

2620
05:00:49,979 --> 05:00:52,700
To do something like that you that's what you have to do

2621
05:00:53,419 --> 05:00:54,950
You know what I mean?

2622
05:00:54,950 --> 05:00:58,229
I can't like unless I like wrote that book on stream

2623
05:00:59,450 --> 05:01:03,369
It would never get done because that's what what am I doing? That's what i'm doing right now, you know

2624
05:01:03,770 --> 05:01:05,770
There's only so much time in a day

2625
05:01:06,090 --> 05:01:08,090
Where if you focus on something

2626
05:01:08,490 --> 05:01:15,080
That's kind of what you're focusing on

2627
05:01:15,159 --> 05:01:17,159
stream making an adventure book

2628
05:01:17,400 --> 05:01:23,560
Yeah, but I don't that's as much as everybody says that that's something fun to do I I don't work well that way

2629
05:01:25,110 --> 05:01:30,150
I have to be like silent just staring at a screen when I come up with something that I want to try or write or

2630
05:01:31,639 --> 05:01:33,720
Talk, you know like uh when I came up with like, you know

2631
05:01:33,720 --> 05:01:37,240
They're getting blood taken from me and putting the uh in the spinning machine for the lie detector

2632
05:01:37,240 --> 05:01:45,299
I mean I was silent just staring at the screen

2633
05:01:45,459 --> 05:01:47,860
Smart click so you guys write it for me

2634
05:01:50,490 --> 05:01:52,330
No

2635
05:01:52,330 --> 05:01:53,770
Anyways, that is going to be it

2636
05:01:53,770 --> 05:01:58,169
We got a few more here moo means moo one dollar lego's bionicle boomer the mask of light

Thanks for the one dollar. By the way, the name is pronounced coal not cool

2640
05:02:04,979 --> 05:02:10,740
And for some strange reason I watched like five ads and didn't get any bits for them which caused this message to get delayed

2641
05:02:11,540 --> 05:02:15,139
Anyway, now that i'm here. I'm not really sure what to say other than you're a great streamer

2642
05:02:15,540 --> 05:02:18,979
And i'm looking forward to future streams and future biomic bionic booming

2643
05:02:19,459 --> 05:02:21,459
Hashtag charity. Thank you col

2644
05:02:22,729 --> 05:02:26,569
