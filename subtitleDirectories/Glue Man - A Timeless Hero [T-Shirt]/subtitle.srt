1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:08,199
Timeless. Legendary. Strong.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,099
Those are some of the words you could use to describe Glooman.

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,000
One of our world's greatest superheroes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,699
And for the first time ever, you can adorn yourself with this upper body garment.

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,679
The Glooman t-shirt is now available.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,679
Yes, that's right. Glooman, protector of the innocent, defender of justice,

7
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,979
and warden of all that is good and kind, has finally caved into marketing pressure

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,049
to deliver this shirt to you.

9
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:39,450
Buying this shirt will take you back to moments like these.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,090
Glooman's German wrestling debut.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,689
As a 22-year-old newbie under the stage name G. Grossi,

12
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,789
he made a real splash in his first match when he was nearly killed by Dogman,

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,289
the magical dog magician, who at the time was considered at least partially blind.

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,429
Each shirt does not come with a certificate of authenticity,

15
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,530
but this might be what one may have looked like if they did.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,030
Signed and stamped by the father of all contemporary German wrestling,

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,870
George R. Glooman Sr. himself.

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,170
It is a true sight of craftsmanship and quality.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,469
And again, no, you don't get one of these.

20
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,670
How much does a t-shirt like this cost, you ask?

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,569
Not $12,000, not $8,000, not even $5,000.

22
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:33,370
To get your very own Glooman t-shirt, you need only one low payment of $20.

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,079
Plus shipping and handling.

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,280
Take pride in owning a piece of German Channel history.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,079
Brag to all of your friends that you own a shirt

26
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,180
whose depicted character has been deemed out loud as the worst character ever

27
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,379
and useless by the individual who created him.

28
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,379
These shirts are only available for a limited time and may never be available again.
