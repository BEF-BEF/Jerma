1
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:39,460
Hey, what's happening? How you doing? Honest to goodness, let's game. Yeah, more, I mean, you,

2
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:48,420
you know what we're doing. I don't gotta tell you. You know, I don't gotta tell you what we're doing.

3
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:58,820
You already know. Dark and Darker again tonight. Gonna be playing with a few different groups.

4
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,480
Gonna be jumping around. First group, we got...

5
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:23,859
Italics. Italics is here tonight. Permission to swag out. Yeah, sure, I guess. And then,

6
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:34,709
the other participant in the group for group one. Gonna be poke. Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.

7
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:42,359
Can we, can everybody yell, please? And then a little bit later, we're gonna maybe get

8
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,799
criken in here. And then later, I'm gonna play with Will Neff. I'm gonna be jumping around all

9
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:59,319
over the place tonight. So, but we'll start here. Trying to play with as many people as I can,

10
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:07,379
because it's obviously over in a few days. Promise not to germa this up this time.

11
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:16,360
I was not responsible for even half of those deaths. I was not responsible for half of our wipes.

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,500
You're talking about people, people were like paying money to kill me in the game. Like,

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,780
that's not, I don't think anybody was trying very particularly hard a couple days ago. I don't think

14
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:39,689
that's the case. But yeah, that's the plan tonight. After today, I'm not going to be streaming this

15
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,340
game again. I, this is the last night you'll see it. I'm gonna probably stream for a little

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:56,180
bit tonight. I don't know how long, but you know, we'll see. Because this weekend, on Sunday,

17
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,819
Ster and I are gonna do Elden Ring mods again. So, I gotta, I gotta move on to something else

18
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:14,819
at some point, right? And then after that, at some point next week, maybe that's when I'll tap back

19
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,750
into like sorcery. Breath of the Wild, maybe. I gotta finish some of this stuff, right? So,

20
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,180
we'll probably do that too. Maybe Frog Detective as well. Just gonna wait. Hylics. Yeah,

21
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:34,569
that's probably where you'll see that. The new randomizer seed. I think we're doing different

22
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,849
mods. I think we're doing randomizer with other stuff on it to make it even more ridiculous.

23
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,530
And I cannot promise that that we're going to beat the game again. But we're gonna at least play it

24
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:53,050
again and do one final just kind of mayhem run and just see what happens. So, I don't know,

25
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:00,840
we'll see. I am not promising we're going to play another like 30 hours of Elden Ring. But I don't

26
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,000
know what Ster has in store for us. Because Ster is the one that is putting it together. So, he's

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,840
putting all these mods together. So, he's, I'm just, he's just like, hey, I'll give, I'll give

28
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,479
you the folders when I need to. Or I'll tell you what to download when, when, when we're ready.

29
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:32,170
So, I don't know what it could be anything. Yeah, more dark and darker. I think I talked to Poke,

30
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,529
talked to Italics. Italics is currently in the call. But he is, I think, starting to stream

31
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:53,740
doing his intro. So, we're just gonna hang out. Seven Hour Visual Novel Mod Pack. Visual Novel

32
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:04,980
Elden Ring. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing pretty good. Hope you're doing good.

33
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,089
Do you like circus peanuts? No, so you say this dude loves circus peanuts. I don't know where

34
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:21,829
you're getting that from. I like biting into a circus peanut. I like, the texture of a circus

35
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:28,339
peanut is very interesting to me. After that, it gets a little weird, I think. You can, I can

36
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:35,430
really only eat one circus peanut. And then I don't want another one for a year. But I, I don't,

37
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:46,920
I enjoy that one circus peanut. It's pretty cool. Texture, bro. This ain't Minecraft. Why is

38
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:55,420
something, why is texture Minecraft to you? It's not, everything's not Minecraft. Texture is a

39
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:06,980
word to describe tech. Oh my god, whatever. What the fuck? They've got a point. Texture,

40
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:24,939
everything has to be Minecraft. All right, let's see if we've got, let's see. Yeah, I'm gonna add

41
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:37,339
Poke, I think, right now. And let's get Poke in here. Poke and I have a very interesting

42
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,019
relationship. Poke and I were part of a team. Oh, I'll wait till Poke gets in here. Talk about

43
00:06:43,019 --> 00:07:01,259
our Smite World Championship prospects. Hold on. There we go. Oh, whoops. Uh, I'll just call

44
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:16,649
Italics back. I made a different group. That's my fault. I forgot. I'm right now, I'm gonna call

45
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:29,529
with Italics and he's getting a call from me again. How does that work? Hey, what's up? How

46
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:36,339
you doing? Are you ready to get some dubs? Hey, are you ready to get a potential Smite World

47
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:42,819
Championship? Oh, there you are. What's up? Hey, what's up? Yeah, sorry. I had to, I called again.

48
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:51,990
I'm an idiot and I made two groups. That's all good. You sound the same. Oh, hey, what's up,

49
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,819
everybody? Hey, how are you? You sound the same, just nicer. Hey, what's up? Oh, hey, everybody.

50
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:07,129
How are you? Yo, I'm Poke. What's up, German Poke? No, it's been a while, Poke. It's been a while.

51
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,529
Played Smite, right? Yeah, and we were best friends. I retweeted that. That was really fun.

52
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:19,610
That was fun. We broke up, but we got over it and we're here. All right, so Italics does not

53
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,889
really know how to play the game, so I hope you're not ready to try really hard. I've got two. I'm

54
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,339
really good at teaching people how to play. Good, good, good, good, good. I do have some credentials.

55
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:36,220
Okay, I played a bunch of Tarkov. I played a bunch of Mountain Blade and I played a bunch

56
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,019
of Chivalry and this is just those games. He's fucking good too. He was one of the best fucking

57
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:46,149
Tarkov players I've ever seen in my life. Okay, you're good then. He's only seen one.

58
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:56,679
All right, let's do it. We'll poke. What's your name in the game? My name is Movie. It's okay.

59
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:05,159
I love that name. Just Movie. Yeah, I got lucky. That's actually pretty lucky. I was there when

60
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,929
the game just came up and I just put random names. I got Movie, I got Music, I got... That's like

61
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,850
putting David in. I also got Carl, just Carl. I was gonna say, yeah, I had to put a one on mine.

62
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:24,440
Carl has got fucked over, but I got all the Carl's. Carl one, Carl two, Carl three, Carl four.

63
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,580
This is the next one. I don't see your invite. URL Gold Rush. You can sell those on eBay now.

64
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:39,240
I allow your invite. You can invite me now. There we go. I got it. Yo. So you play fighter? Yeah,

65
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,539
I play fighter. Do you want me to roll something else? I'll swap, I'll swap. I have like... Oh,

66
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:52,250
fighter meta? I'm gonna try this. All right, what do I have? I'm bringing up Carl. Should I bring my

67
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:59,100
Zwayander for this one? No, not first match. That would be stupid. What the hell am I talking

68
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:08,139
about? Did you just ask if you want to bring like your most valuable weapon into my basically first

69
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:15,500
game? I'm likely to just friendly fire you at the first portal and just take it off your body and

70
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:23,720
then escape. Yeah, all right. I'm bringing you a weapon. Oh. Aetalics. Aetalics. My friends call me

71
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:33,299
E. No, you should say E-tal. E-tal. E. I got you, bro. Did you just call him Elm? Were you gonna call him Elm Tree?

72
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,330
Elm Tree? I thought you said Elm, like you were gonna call him Elm Tree. No, no, I'm gonna call

73
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,500
him E. But I got you a weapon. That's perfect. I got you a Z... No, no, no. Zwayander. My friends call me E. My

74
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,139
loved ones call me Biggie, so your choice. Oh, shit. All right. All right, you guys ready? Yeah.

75
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,740
All right, ready up. E. The game asked me if I wanted to check my loadout and I was like, no, I'm going

76
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:08,700
in naked. You don't have anything, do you? I know. All right, I gotta put headphones in. Polk, have you

77
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,940
done any of the red dungeons? Yeah, I've done a lot for this game. Are they hard? Yeah, it's hard.

78
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,779
I mean, it's kind of hard, yeah. Have you done High Roller? It's really hard. Have you done High Roller?

79
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,860
No, I'm terrified. I'm too much of a wuss. Let's get 100 bucks and go just for fun. Polk, I have a

80
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:36,730
lot of money. Like, my whole stash is gold coins and I'm just like scared to use them. Do the stashes

81
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,769
continue through demos or like wipe per demo? Yeah, it's gonna be all gone soon. You have to spend it.

82
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:53,100
No. You have to. Here, take the sword. I need to rebind Effany. Wait, where's it? Which one? I gave

83
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,090
it to him. I gave it to him, not you, sorry. What the fuck? Oh, I thought you have money. No,

84
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:06,149
I got one, yeah. All right, so, Taleks, here's how you click to swing. Oh, really? Let's fucking go.

85
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:14,100
Wow, great teacher. You ever played Mordhau? Yeah. Chivalry counts, hopefully? Yeah, yeah,

86
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,590
it's like that. Are we moving through this door or are you scouting? I'm sorry. I was moving,

87
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:26,460
I had to move something. Hey, by the way, Taleks, bugs kill, so be aware. Okay, do I have like,

88
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,980
is there an overhand, like an overhead swing or am I just cleaving everybody? Oh, no, yeah.

89
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,320
Third attack or a second attack, like a combo, like swing and then swing. That's right click.

90
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,259
Okay. But you can swing twice. Swing and then boom. Yeah, it's a three combo for everybody,

91
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:53,909
right? Yeah, just every weapon has a different animation, so. This game is so fun. All right.

92
00:12:53,909 --> 00:13:00,629
Yeah. Oh my god. I'm sure I'm safe corner. There's shit everywhere, there's loot everywhere,

93
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:10,789
you have to get it. Oh, enemies, enemies. Where? I'm gonna fireball him. I got him,

94
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:17,769
direct hit. Nice shot. I'm gonna get him again. Did you just kill that person? No,

95
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:25,610
he got away though. All right, I'm so bad at this. It's a jumping puzzle at the beginning of the map.

96
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,419
This is a big tip E. E? Press X on holster and then to make this jump. I made a jump crouch.

97
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,409
Yeah, make sure you don't have anything in your hands, it's very hard. It actually,

98
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:41,269
nobody laugh at it if it doesn't make it. Oh my gosh. No, that was actually pretty impressive.

99
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:50,870
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, you got it done. I won't say anything else. I'm going back to dome.

100
00:13:50,870 --> 00:14:06,360
Oh, what was that? Where are they? Oh, okay. Are you alone? Oh, hey, I'm talking, communicating.

101
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:14,470
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's right. You did shoot two. Why am I acting like a meteor? You fucking attacked

102
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,460
them. I'm sorry. I thought you were a monster. I won't shoot you. He thought you were a monster

103
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:32,840
and he, that's why that happened. Don't worry. You're trapped. There's a trap here. You lied.

104
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:48,419
I'm fucking dead. We got an archer back there too. It's the last thing you hear. I'm dead.

105
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,070
You have to kill him. I'm hasting you. I'm going to go this door. I'm going to bounce off the walls.

106
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,299
They're trying to go. I hasted. I'm giving you invisibility. You're invisible.

107
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, that's actually a good strat lying on the internet. Yeah. What the fuck is going on here?

108
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:26,379
All right, Carl. I'm going in. Oh, got one in the head. Oh, I'm going in. One hit. Impressive.

109
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:35,220
Oh my God. It's how it's fucking gigachad. Nice, man. All right. Okay. I'm going to take

110
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:43,080
Jerma's soul. Okay. Yeah. So should I be looting right now? You loot. I'll go heal.

111
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,600
So there were two, just two. It looks like it was three. Yeah. But then we killed a third,

112
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,940
is what I'm asking. Yeah, they're all dead. Okay. They put a trap down on the door.

113
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:09,700
My last words were you lied. What a shitty way to go. I was trying to disarm it. Oh,

114
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,100
you right click to loot fast. Okay. So I just leave white gear. Yeah. Unless it can replace,

115
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,940
if you have nothing in it, if you have no boots or no, having something is better than nothing,

116
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,320
obviously. Yeah. It's going to take some white gear at home now. If you have nothing. Yeah. I

117
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,100
just beat those guys with no armor. Yeah. Well, you are barbarian. Barbarian is kind of.

118
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,379
Don't take this from me. Okay. It's all I have. Okay. Well, what you did was very good. Can you

119
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:47,179
help me out, please? I need to help my friend. Oh, not me. Can you please help me out? Should

120
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:51,659
I be going over there? I just need to get to my friend, heal and arrest my friend. Are you good?

121
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:58,500
Everybody's so full of shit in this game. It's so funny. Yeah. Please don't hurt me. I'm very,

122
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,269
I have nothing. I have nothing. I have nothing. Yes. One of them is naked. Here,

123
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:16,440
you guys can have this. What did you give him? It's getting. What did you do? There's a heel

124
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:27,019
right here. Listen, E. Yeah. You got to hide. I got to hide. Okay. Yeah. You kind of. Or something.

125
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:31,019
Yeah. Figure it out. You got you guys kind of opposite directions right now. Yeah. We're on

126
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:39,079
like other side of that room. I'm looping around. I'm looping around. You got to. Oh, should I use

127
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:45,269
a bandage or something? Yeah. If you have any heels, definitely use them. That's the craziest

128
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:57,990
spider ever. It's still behind you. Not bad. Not bad. That did nothing. Okay. Yeah. The bandages

129
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,000
are pretty awful, but they're better than nothing. Healing potions are instant and they're kind of a

130
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,759
hot. It's like Diablo 2. Everything in this game is Diablo 2. Just imagine. Did one of these guys

131
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:11,960
have a heal potion? What is this? Yep. Pick that up. That's a heal potion. Oh, that's mine. Yeah.

132
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,579
Take that. Whoops. There's a resin here, but it's so. Oh no, it's going to be way too hard.

133
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:32,220
I can try. Is that a red bat too? Okay. Um, what should I do now? You, you should probably try to

134
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:41,589
find him. I think the walls closing in from the West. Oh yeah. You want to, uh, Alex, you want to

135
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:50,789
try to get to the sort of middle of bottom right of the circle. Are you okay over there? I'm being

136
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:59,509
shot at by your friends. I think. Oh yeah. I ran past them. Yeah. They're evil. Oh no, this is an

137
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:05,640
evil mob. Yeah. Oh, I'm screwed. Red. If the, if the skeleton is red or the monster is red,

138
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,869
it means they're an elite version and they're, they're horrible. Okay. Yeah. I'm dead guys.

139
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:22,220
Oh, you guys want to backseat game me? You're the one with the kills. Yeah, but I have no concept

140
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,539
of space or location other than there's apparently a wall here. Yeah. It's essentially what you're

141
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:33,900
looking for right now, Alex, is you're just trying to get out. So you're looking for a blue podium,

142
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,900
a blue podium. It's going to go and it's, it's kind of textured. Oh, Minecraft. It's textured.

143
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:47,859
So you'll know what it looks. It's blue, bright blue. Red goes to a different dungeon. So you

144
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:52,099
don't want to go to the red one. Blue. You're looking for that's a trap, right? That's a trap.

145
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:57,980
Yeah. Don't go there. Okay. But if the only other way to go, there's like three guys, I think you'll

146
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,740
live. No, no, you'll be fine. Yeah. If you just play it slow here. Well, yeah, play it slow and

147
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,839
just, you're just looking for a portal. There's at least three here somewhere in the circle. So

148
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,920
there's like three minutes left in the match. Yeah. Bottom right. Okay. You are just trying

149
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,640
to hear that. Yeah. Where's that coming from? That's that's that direction. That is a portal

150
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,319
coming up through the ground. It could be a red one though. I think it's a red one because you

151
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,950
can see the kill feed pop up, right? It's a three down portal portal. It's a red one. I think so.

152
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,339
This game sucks. Oh, yeah. Crouch here. Crouch. Yeah. Oh, right. Forgot. Yeah. This stuff that

153
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:37,339
shoots out of the walls. And it's almost impossible to tell. So when you're going through a little

154
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:43,900
hallway like this crouch, there's damage coming from nowhere. Okay. Is it it's okay to be like

155
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,859
walking around with a torch, right? Like, yeah. I mean, you're just trying to find a way out right

156
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:57,079
now and try to leave with whatever you picked up. Listen, I hear footsteps to my left. I think it's

157
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:03,420
behind you. There's another one. Did you hear that? Like, are you quieter when you're crouching? Like

158
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,680
in Tarkov? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are these invisible walls? Like, what is this? Yeah. You hit him five

159
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:25,349
times. Don't tell him. Can I sacrifice you to the great old ones? There it is. You need that. Yep.

160
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:34,019
Hitty. And just get out of here. It's the second it comes up. Well, the answer to that question

161
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:43,930
is no. How is he better than us? Hey, we're out. Easy game. I understand what the problem is.

162
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,049
Here's the thing. I was a distraction, right? So if I didn't stand in that trap, then they may

163
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,130
have been like, oh shit, like we got somebody and then they killed me and they were just really not

164
00:21:53,130 --> 00:22:00,970
prepared for the next part. I claim about 20% of that victory. Well, I retired Carl and now I'm on,

165
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:10,440
I couldn't get the other names. I'm on Tom Guy Peter. It's my Ranger. Your names are like,

166
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:24,710
they're awesome. Can I show you my wizard? Yeah. There. Ice and frost. And fire. And, you know,

167
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,829
everything else. Et cetera, et cetera. All right. So, you understand the game now. You get it. Now

168
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,299
we're going to try as hard as we can now. Yeah, we were just acting for that one. But important,

169
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:45,019
folk, we have to make sure that he understands this. You just, did you have, do you have anything,

170
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:49,829
you have like stuff in your inventory right now? Yeah. Oh yeah. I need to put in stash, huh? Or

171
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,950
sell it. Because if you picked up anything that's a chalice or a- Oh yeah. You go to merchants and

172
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:06,869
like the chalice stuff is the collector. Yeah. So- What did you say was fast transfer hotkey?

173
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:12,789
Is it like a- Oh, shift click is to go from wherever you want to the

174
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,250
sell window and shift right click puts it in your stash. Ah, shift right click. I was trying to

175
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,309
shift left click. So if you have any of those little trinkets, you want to sell them because

176
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,670
that's the way you make gold. That's how you, you sell anything to make money. It's one of the only

177
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,589
ways, unless you find it or- Okay. I don't want you guys to have to like wait longer. So I'll just

178
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:35,349
do the selling stuff. Oh, I'm fine. No, we're good. We're good. Jeremy, you got money, right?

179
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:41,609
I've got, yeah, I got money. Go to the goblin merchant. Um, but hold on. I, I'm going to give

180
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,230
you some guilt armor. If, uh, I stole this from somebody and I have to get rid of it. So I'm going

181
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,779
to put the sin on you now. What is it? What kind of armor is it? It's purple, uh, ranger armor.

182
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I stole it from somebody and I'm just going to, I'm just moving the guilt

183
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:04,099
to you. Okay. Are you okay with that? Yes. All right, cool. Yeah, that's cool. Thank you. Okay.

184
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:08,819
I'm going to actually, I'm going to, I'm going to have a good sword this time. I dare you to gamble

185
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:14,740
one time. Okay. At the goblin merchant. Does he have anything for sale for you? Yeah, he's got like

186
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:24,359
gloves. Uh, I'll try gloves. Do it. I'm not doing that ever again. Oh, okay. Well, I'm ready. Sorry.

187
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:35,609
I got like a fucking, like default gloves. Poke, you said that it was going to be awesome. There's

188
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:46,069
a chance. Okay. Hold on. So Jim's ceremonial, anything blue? Blue is, is very good. I mean,

189
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:51,420
no, no, no, no, sorry. Blue background. That's like, that's like vendor trash. That's stuff you

190
00:24:51,420 --> 00:25:01,289
can wear. Red background. Like, uh, Jim rings, bangles, goblets, uh, candle holders. Yeah,

191
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:11,049
that's the collector. Yeah. The collector, the vendors are spread out in a way where like the,

192
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:16,809
you have to sell the gear that would sell to that person. So you can't sell a sword to the guy that

193
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:22,069
takes, um, trinkets. It's, uh, okay. Yeah. You have to do it into the right vendor. It'll be like,

194
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:39,779
Oh, that vendor doesn't want that item. All right. How do you get rid of like actual trash?

195
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,539
Just throw it down at the ground. Um, at the end of the, at the beginning of the match.

196
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:48,259
Okay. Like if it's, if it's like a gray that is not even worth anything, then you just throw it

197
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:54,630
away. You can even sell it to, and it'll just be sell for zero. All right, let's do it. Okay.

198
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:03,690
Got something cool for you. Yay. Hey, if you lose it, I'm going to be pissed off by the way.

199
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:15,450
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm already sorry. I'm always sorry. All right, let's go. I brought a decent

200
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:28,200
weapon this time, so I don't want to, I don't want to blow it. Please get gold bags from the treasure.

201
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,900
No, I want to, I want it out. I like looking at the coins. Uh, once again,

202
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I brought no bandages, no potions. I think I'll just take them from your dead body again.

203
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:47,799
We worked last time, so that's a good tried and true strap. All right, poke.

204
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:56,890
Yo, I got this for you. Look at that. Oh, wait, that's really good. Wow. Don't, don't pick that

205
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:13,059
up. Don't pick that up either. It's my old self. All right. Begin the looting. So just break ship

206
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:18,730
break, whatever you can break, touch, whatever you can touch, open up, whatever you can open

207
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:29,160
the game is, is just pick up everything. Okay. So I'm going to have to, oh, Barians and doors is

208
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,400
like an awful combo. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just the weapon you, once you get a felling axe.

209
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,579
Okay. That's like the best weapon. It's like two zombies, three zombies. Yeah. Some of these,

210
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:48,069
some rooms are actually awful. So sometimes they're best to be avoided. We should go straight here.

211
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:59,160
We should go straight here. Yeah. I've started down there plenty of times and you just die.

212
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:08,390
It just sucks being down there. Oh, this is the worst place. Who can break doors?

213
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:24,500
Barbarians. You can eventually, I think you can eventually. But yeah, even like the basic enemies

214
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:32,039
are terrifying to me right now. As they should be. Go through here. We go here. That's where we came

215
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:40,059
from. Yeah. But we go down. Is it, is it good to like shut doors behind you or? Yeah. Usually.

216
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:51,029
Yeah. Oh, careful poke. This guy farts. Oh yeah. He sure does. Is it poison or does it hurt?

217
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,690
It just hurts when you're in it. That's good. At least I almost just took that in the face.

218
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:01,769
Oh, I hear somebody. I'm, I'm being overly cautious right now. Above, above, above.

219
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:24,740
Is there somebody in here? I heard somebody. Who's in there? Thank you. Good job. Well done team.

220
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:34,380
Ooh. All right. Good call. Good call. Okay. So right click is pretty good in these like narrow

221
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,869
hallways, I guess. Oh, I hear him. I hear him. Yeah. Wizard. What do you guys, what do you guys

222
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,940
want to do? I don't know. I'm kind of just like charging unless you guys have stuff to lose that

223
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:53,880
run away. Are they up or down? They're up. They're up. Okay. Up mid I think. We can, we can go across

224
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,039
this. Go for it. Straight ahead behind this big pillar. Uh, west, west, west. Yep. Okay. Are you

225
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:04,380
guys friendly? He's doing a fireball. Uh oh. I think the answer is no. You guys want to trade?

226
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:15,509
There's people up top though as well. You guys want to trade? Ooh, that hurt. Yeah, that stung.

227
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:32,420
Yeah. Watch out. Fireballs hurt. Nice. Got one. One more down here. One guy. Nice. Got two. Got one guy.

228
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:39,190
There's missiles coming in from the east. I'm just trying to run around them. I'm going up top.

229
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:47,990
I stepped on them. Oh nice. Is there fall damage? Nope. No. All right. That was pretty good. Pretty

230
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,950
good. One guy, one guy was hiding in this room. He died. Oh, he died? He just died and I killed him.

231
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,779
No, that's so sad. Oh shit. They had a lot of stuff. All right. We're gonna, all right. I'm not

232
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,619
gonna. A lot of dead bodies over here. I'm gonna switch those. Hold on. There's like that, there's

233
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:14,980
blue axes and shit. Yeah. Can I take the potions? Yeah. So like the best stat on a weapon or anything

234
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,390
is like all attributes. That's like the god stat. That's like the plus one to all skills for Diablo

235
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:37,910
2, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so like just leave white weapons or just something's better than

236
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:42,150
nothing, I guess? Something is always better than nothing, but if you have, if your inventory is

237
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:50,569
full, then you start dropping, you know, grays and all that shit. Trinkets are always worth holding,

238
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:56,890
but if you, if you, if you could fit more chalices in your backpack, get rid of like a white weapon,

239
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:08,420
right? Yeah. I don't pick up the gray stuff. Usually. All right. I am kind of hurt, but we

240
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,539
should probably start to. I'm gonna drop some heals right here. Actually I'll use a campfire.

241
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:18,779
That's a good idea. Right here. Oh, this is a great time to explain a new mechanic.

242
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:26,579
They, they, they buffed campfires, didn't they? Yeah. All right. Come here fast and you press F on

243
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:38,920
it and it heals you. Oh, sweet. What a beautiful little camping spot. This is just wait till

244
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,089
somebody just buries an ax in the back of your head while you're doing this. Okay. What's the

245
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,930
worst thing that could happen to us right then? Like, is there, is there like a AOE that would

246
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,730
one shot? I mean, a barbarian with a felling ax, just turning the corner and hitting you once in

247
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:59,720
the head. Yeah. Or like a geared mage fireballs. All right. Watch out for this, uh, like, uh,

248
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:08,309
E you can use these right here or use a, use a health pot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you guys hear that?

249
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:24,230
Yep. Skeleton up here. I feel like somebody's skeleton here. Nice. Ooh. Who could even use

250
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,690
this right now? Blue quarterstaff plus one to all attributes. Maybe it's Alex. Maybe. Oh,

251
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:36,359
I don't know what any one, any one of you on this, uh, skeleton. Let's take a look at this. Let me

252
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,259
see. It's a quarterstaff. So it's kind of, they're really, really strong, but they're kind of weird

253
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:49,910
to use. Right. Yeah. I haven't really tried it. I heard something over back by me. Sounded

254
00:33:49,910 --> 00:34:01,430
mechanical. Yeah. It might be a skeleton archer, but let's see. Um, like one 35 just like Diablo

255
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:12,070
bat chest. Hey, it's Alex. Do you remember, do you remember Diablo two? Oh, Diablo two. You're

256
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:19,260
going to freaking love this game. I remember the greatest ARPG that's ever been made and never been

257
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:29,320
duplicated except by the remaster Diablo two. I loved it too. It's probably one of the best games

258
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:41,750
of all time. The blue portal. Ooh. All right. Who wants to get out of here? Oh, you got the, that

259
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:48,760
purple and, but Alex, what do you got? Um, my best is a, the blue quarterstaff and a green Marauder

260
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:56,360
outfit. And that's it. I just hover near it. Wait for three. Yeah. You should definitely take it

261
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,960
though, because you, you, you probably have the least amount of stuff and money. Are you saying

262
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,880
I'm poor? I, yeah, I would definitely take it. You should just get out of here. Why, why the lights

263
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,719
off here? Hey, wait, wait, wait. Actually, before you go there, like just honestly, like just take

264
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:17,179
all this. Oh dude, money. Just take everything and then get out, get the hell out of here. You

265
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:21,909
know what? Fucking take this too. You know what? Just take everything. I don't have that much

266
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:29,030
space. Just fucking take everything I want. Go, go, get out of here. Hurry. Oh, someone's here. Hey,

267
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,599
are you friendly? You gotta, you gotta get out of here. I'm going. Hey, we can talk. I'm not gonna

268
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,000
hurt you. People are getting naked in here. I could have killed you right there. I'm friendly, man. Hey,

269
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,340
what's up? What's going on? Hey, watch out. Watch out for the trap, man. Watch out. There's a trap

270
00:35:44,340 --> 00:36:01,130
here. I want the goblet. Someone's coming. This game is crazy, man. Did you not put any of your

271
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:12,260
armor back on? No. Okay. Who's taking it? I, it should be you. I have literally nothing.

272
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:22,360
I gave everything to italics and he left. No. No? We find two. We find two? No, you know,

273
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:31,849
you get out of here. Right here, right here. Are you good? Did you make it? No, I'm gonna find one.

274
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:37,449
No, no, you have way better stuff than I do. I threw all my stuff to italics. I'm already,

275
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:43,349
I'm already there. All right, I'm going in. Oh, there's a, I didn't realize there was actually

276
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:54,889
like a kill feed. Oh, there's one down the hall. Oak, you have to survive with the guilt armor.

277
00:36:54,889 --> 00:37:13,699
That's true. He's eating beef jerky. Oh, damn. Oh, that was close. Well, that was fun, though.

278
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,179
I have a lot of weapons. I want to get rid of it. Hey, that was guilt armor anyways. Hey, I'm,

279
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:25,659
I'm two for two, but that's only because you let me go this time. So now honestly, being able to

280
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:31,019
leave and make a little bit of money is just, you can buy potions and ban it. You, you're going to

281
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:44,920
need it. Stash is coming together here. Yep. Can you, uh, sell the merchants directly from the stash?

282
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,630
I don't know. Oh yeah. You can sell, you don't have to put it in your stash. You can just sell

283
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,110
it from your bag too. Yeah. But like, if you have stuff in your stash, can you sell from that?

284
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:01,400
Yeah, you can. Well, you, you can just sell right from your stash. I didn't know that. That's cool.

285
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:08,409
You mean just like from the stash window or no? You have to like actually be in the merchant window.

286
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:14,780
I meant like, uh, be in the merchant window, but stash open. Yeah. On the right side, you can see

287
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:31,539
little stash button. Oh yeah. You can play stuff in stash. Blue throwing axes. Is that even worth,

288
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,940
like you can't, can you recover thrown weapons? Nope. They are, they are just a consumable,

289
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:47,929
but they're very, very good if you get good ones. All right. I'm good to just to rock back in when

290
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:55,500
you guys are ready. I'm in. Okay. One second. Should I, should I like buy, um, like heal potion

291
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:03,079
or anything? It's good practice to have and don't get scammed because there is, there's two versions

292
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:07,860
that come in batches of three. One is insanely expensive for not very much more healing. That's

293
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:14,340
only due to that if you're very wealthy, but like the, the cheaper one that's three is usually good

294
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:22,309
to have. Oh, what perk do you have E? Um, I just got level two. So can I pick a perk? Yeah. Go to,

295
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:38,599
go to class and Perk and Skill. So 18 gold for the three stack is good, uh, potions? Uh, yeah. It's

296
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:46,730
not bad. It's always a good practice to have three of the default potion and three bandages if you

297
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,940
can afford it. Okay. So, um, I'm on the perk page. Yeah. You go to perk and skill and then you,

298
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:03,400
you see that available perk you have, or the one perk you have on? Oh yeah. Two-handed weapon

299
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,900
expert. Yeah. Maybe you should just get the, um, the one that lets you break through walls and shit.

300
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:16,099
I like that one. That's like the best perk in my opinion. Uh, smash unreinforced doors and containers

301
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,500
and defeat blocks and parries. Yeah. You should get that one. Just get that one. And I'm going to

302
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,739
bring you, I'm going to bring you a, just a, just a normal axe. You'll have a lot more fun with it.

303
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:36,539
Yeah. Barbarian with the axe is, uh, barbarian with an axe is disgusting. It's fun just bopping

304
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:43,929
people in the head with, um, two shots. Especially if you get like a purple

305
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:48,250
felling axe or something. It's just, you can kill somebody in one hit. I got him a white one for now.

306
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:55,210
Yep. So you can have what, like four perks at a time at level 15? Yeah. Okay. Oh, and you should,

307
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:01,130
I'm just the question asker on the, I am like the audience POV. Like people, people are like tuning

308
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,719
into the streams and be like, I don't know what this game is. And I'm them. I'm just asking questions

309
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:10,980
for them. Hey, you have to learn somewhere. You should replace your second ability with the

310
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:19,449
battle shout one or the one that like, uh, fears everything. That one is really good.

311
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,489
You keep the one that gives you strength and the one that gives you the fear. Uh,

312
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:27,159
7.5 meter radius physical damage. Yeah. That one, that one's bussing. It's super good.

313
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:30,650
Yeah. That one, it's like a stun almost essentially. Yeah. You just walk in a room

314
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,860
and anything that hits you, like the mobs, you just stop them. It's really good. Okay. I'm ready.

315
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:44,329
Is war cry any good? Uh, the max HP buff? Uh, I think the ability, I think the attack bar one's

316
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:55,260
better. Yeah. The one that gives you strength is good. Okay. All right. Let's go. And by the way,

317
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:24,250
to all the stream snipers, three, two, one, let's go for it. That's very kind of you. Yeah. So you

318
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:31,510
said there's like three maps right now in the demo. There's a solo map. There's a team map. And then

319
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:37,340
is the high roller map a different map or is that the same as the regular map, but just harder?

320
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,590
Yeah. The same as, uh, the same one, but harder. I'm willing to pay for it if we want to do it.

321
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:51,400
We should do it. It's fun. It's hard. Okay. Yeah. We should do it. All right. Here's your acts.

322
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,070
Yo, did this acts like, Oh, wait, you, you got out. Oh no. Wait, what? I forgot. You didn't die.

323
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,389
Yeah. I didn't die. Yeah. But just try that one. You'll love it. But what about the greens?

324
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,469
See what you like. Honestly, like swings down, not side to side. So it's easier. It's so much

325
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:16,199
better that, Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh no. You're not using the acts for the felling one. The felling

326
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:22,550
one is like the felling one. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I give you, I give you a felling acts.

327
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:28,489
That one is like, this is what I just picked up off the ground. Oh, I just got hit by that.

328
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:35,750
Shit. I didn't give you a, wait, what is it? This is the acts that I was dropped.

329
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,710
This apparently I gave you the wrong battle. Like you're, you just tried to like scam me,

330
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:46,710
like gaslighting you beautiful acts. I'll give it to you for the little price of a hundred gold.

331
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:53,750
It's a felling acts. Did I really buy a white ass? Wait, you bought, you bought that? No, no, no.

332
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,559
It was like 20 bucks. Oh, it's that bad. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's okay. Oh, we got people. Oh,

333
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:13,380
people up there. Um, let me squeeze in here and fart people on top of us. And there's a,

334
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,820
there's an archer. There's a, there's multiple skeleton archers and they're awful. They don't

335
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:22,170
miss. And the regular archer shooting. And the trick is you crouch before they hit you.

336
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:28,099
I just hold the shield up like archers coming down and archers trying to shoot me.

337
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:37,260
Oh, this, oh, the skeleton archer. Yeah. There's an archer up top on the, on the balcony though.

338
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:46,739
Yeah. He ran away. He closed the door. Nice. Good. So there, there are like cleaves in this game,

339
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:52,260
right? Yeah. You can, yeah, you can, you can swing and hit everything. Okay. I'm, I'm asking more

340
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:59,369
for friendly fire than for anything else. Yeah. You can, you can hit people with a huge, it's like

341
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:09,769
180 degrees in front of you essentially if you hold it down. Oops. These little bats, these bats

342
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:17,940
are my favorite to kill because they drop, uh, amulets and stuff. I hear arrows. Oh, this is

343
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:26,630
yours. Uh, there is a green, uh, armor here. Resourcefulness. Who should, who strength and

344
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:33,099
resourcefulness? Uh, Alex, you should take these. These are green. They got strength and resourcefulness

345
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:41,500
on them. I'm going to drop them for you over here. Probably best in your hands. Okay. On the ground

346
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:59,639
in front of me. Got them. Yeah. The hardest part right now is just learning like weapon range

347
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,809
and, uh, where the tip of the, you know, a lot of random shit. I found one for you.

348
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:12,900
What do you got? Look at that. Head down, ass up. Everybody loot. Same time. Let's go. Oh,

349
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:21,460
shit. Yeah. Hey, E. Hey, what up? Hey, E. Hey, what up? Oh, and here, uh, German for your head,

350
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:30,300
your haircut. Oh, wow. A warm all. Does that mean my haircut's bad? Talk later. Is this

351
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:41,820
your haircut? So there's like a three attack progression for every weapon. Yeah. Everything

352
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,860
has a three chain. Uh, I think so. When do you queue up the second swing? I know it's just stupid.

353
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:54,599
Uh, hold it. Baby questions. You just hold it. If it's not in a row, it will not chain together.

354
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,000
Okay. So you could do click and then click, or you could just hold. Holding is probably a little

355
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,059
easier because then you can let it go when you don't want to swing it third time. This campfire

356
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:17,190
for us. I'm a campfire for us. Why not? So what did they change with the campfire? This heals more

357
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:24,900
or something. I think it's just longer. Oh, come over here. Yeah, I'm coming. Movement.

358
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:38,309
Oh, movement. Oh, shit. Behind me. Behind me. Ah. Up the stairs as well. Stairs. Behind you.

359
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:53,659
Folk behind you. Okay. I'm running back a little bit. They flanked us. Yeah, they did. They come

360
00:47:53,659 --> 00:48:07,590
through. They come through. Oh, that hurt. Oh, I almost just hit you guys. He's gotta be low.

361
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:14,170
Oh, the archer got me. The archer got me. That, that, the, the, the two hitters probably low.

362
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:21,289
Fighters probably low. He's coming in with a peeling potion. I'm almost dead. Yeah. I can't

363
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:29,269
hit shit with this mall. I'm so afraid of that archer. This is so Scott. The archer will kill,

364
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:39,719
the archer will kill. Yo. Oh, I thought I killed him. Fuck. I can't hit. The range on this mall is

365
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,679
dog shit. Yeah. Oh my God. I had healing potions in my fucking inventory. I didn't even, I forgot

366
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:50,019
I bought them. I thought, oh shit. I'm an idiot. Don't even blame yourself. The mall is just like

367
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:59,639
the axe. I'll buy you one right now. I got you a felling axe. Okay. I had every swing. I had six

368
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:10,230
potions and I didn't even drink one. I did drink a potion, but they heal like 10%. Hey, we're just

369
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:18,980
warming up. We're warming up. Come on. That was my first death in this game. You know what? You know

370
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,300
what it is? A lot of times I don't buy anything because I go, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to

371
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,539
fucking lose it. I'm not buying shit. I'm just going for it. And then when you actually do buy shit,

372
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:38,860
it's, you just forget that you did that. Okay. I'm going to remember, I'm buying it. I'm buying it

373
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:45,349
right now. This is like fighting in a dream. You're like stuck in quicksand. You can't move.

374
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:54,119
Everything's heavy. Shit. I take the L on that one. I could have fucking healed. No, no, no, no,

375
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:07,909
I tricked us with the food. I was working for them. Bye. You know what? I don't even care if I lose

376
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:14,010
it. I'm bringing out the big, I'm bringing out the big gun. How's the, um, the quarterstaff?

377
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:22,619
Quarterstaff is fun to use. It's just, it has like a swing down, then you swing the bottom part up.

378
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:28,780
So it has like a swing down animation, then like a swing up animation. All right. Put,

379
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:38,539
put a value on like just the average green or blue or like higher quality in terms of like gold.

380
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:44,860
Blues are worth a lot more than, than greens, I would say. Like you talk about like, like how

381
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:49,820
much it, like to sell it. Yeah. Like, uh, like whether or not you want to, ooh, should I go

382
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,179
win with this and risk losing it? Like what's, what's the gold value of? I mean, the blues are

383
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:59,980
gonna, they, they can carry you through a run. If you have like a good blue weapon or like a good

384
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,420
three or four blues on for equipment, you're going to take a lot less damage. Yeah. But if you like

385
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:13,750
die with one, how much money did you lose? Oh, like maybe 40 gold, 30 gold for like a couple of

386
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:19,909
items. Maybe they sell for like what? 10 to 20, a lot of times 15. Okay. I got you a weapon. Okay.

387
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:25,610
I got you weapon E. It's good. Sick. All right. I'm coming in with my purple sword. I got a purple

388
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:34,019
and I am not around this time. I am so angry. Oh, get, get pissed off. Get angry. Cause this is how

389
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,179
we're going to, I'm so mad. I'm ready. You don't sound that mad to me. I don't know if we can do

390
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:50,340
it. I'm buying some potions. Get angry. I'm tense. How do you swap between, um, number four? Uh,

391
00:51:50,340 --> 00:52:03,739
you just hit four. All right. I'm ready. I'm going to, if I lose my purple, I lose my purple boat.

392
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:06,619
I'm not going to, cause we're going to destroy. I'm going to find you purples. We're going to

393
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:11,829
find purples. I'm just glad I haven't killed either of you yet. Outside of not killing the

394
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:21,050
guys who killed you first. Hey, what'd you say? Did you hear the voice in the loading screen?

395
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:31,480
I was at you. Yeah. Oh, I like how you can still talk in the loading screen like a little bit.

396
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,780
All right. I'm trying as hard as I can now. You say you brought a purple in.

397
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,380
I have a purple weapon. I can kill Mo. If I hit somebody in the head, I can kill them in one or

398
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,500
two hits. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah. Boom. Boom. Now that attack

399
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:54,780
animation is good as hell. Heck hell. Try it out. Yep. Uh, poke. I, I, you might, you probably

400
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,349
didn't know. I, I don't really, like if you're going to say like a swear or something, can you

401
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:04,789
say like, like a crap or, Oh, I know. I was pretending I couldn't. Oh, that stinks. Like you

402
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:08,539
should have, I don't know. I just, maybe next time just be better about it if you can. Oh,

403
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:13,219
okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. It's all right. Just, you know, so there's, you know, is the

404
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:22,550
felling acts like a single attack? Yeah. Okay. Just hit their heads. Yep. Click on heads. Oh,

405
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:35,110
fountain of speed. Yeah. I don't want to hit you with this. So this just makes you run faster,

406
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:45,420
right? What does fountain of speed? Yeah, it does. You should probably take this shit then.

407
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:54,860
Yeah. Um, Alex, you take grief. Oh, me trying protection. I'll take this. Oh, that,

408
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,960
what am I supposed to take this little fountain? Oh, that's my, yeah, the speed, the speed fountain

409
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:11,909
because it makes you run faster. You should take that. I am slow as shit. What do you think we

410
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:22,329
should go this way? I guess so. Should I just be using abilities more often? Like you want to run

411
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:26,489
in the middle there right there and use your E, go in the middle there, use your E or your other Q

412
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:44,219
or your, your other one. Oh, people there, people across. Yep. Mage behind me. Mage. Yep. He needs

413
00:54:44,219 --> 00:55:01,880
like one hit. Got one. Got one. This guy's really low running away. Oh, there's a guy, 195. Oh,

414
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,349
that's, you do play those games. Oh my God. Thank you for saying that. Yeah. He's like, he's not,

415
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:13,369
he's really hurt. I got him. I got him. He's dead. Okay. Let's go. Good shit guys. All right. I

416
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:21,059
didn't kill shit, but I got one call out. So I'll take the assist. Anybody need health? Uh,

417
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,500
I can. Hey, we won that fight. Yeah, it was good. All right. Good fight. Good fight. Nice job.

418
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:36,139
Listen, I'm at a disadvantage. I have to do a new weapon every game. So I'm learning every single,

419
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:41,030
uh, I think you're doing great. Do you want some, uh, some advantages or healing potions to Alex?

420
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,949
Uh, I got two left and there's three on this guy. Yeah. You should take, you should take one.

421
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:48,469
Yeah. You always want to be topped off. Yeah. You want to be close to like 90%

422
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:53,429
can be because it's so easy to die from like one hit in the head that if you could survive too,

423
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:58,900
then you might kill the other person bandages versus potions. Just bandages are small potions.

424
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:04,340
Basically. Yeah. Just use a potion and then use a bandage on after that. I got a campfire as well.

425
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:11,739
We need it also potion of protection. Like these right here, I'm dropping one. You always want to

426
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:16,949
pop that before a fight. It's like, it's really, really helpful. Uh, there's a tracker box just

427
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:33,099
30. Oh, fine. Oh yeah. It's two, two people. We both just did the same thing. Trying to throw

428
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:42,630
axes. Okay. There he goes. His buddy's over here somewhere at a 15 down the hall. West is the other

429
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:56,630
one. Yep. He's got a potion. I killed this guy. Yep. This guy's just way throwing his old stuff.

430
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:02,389
Careful. Uh, don't engage too much, which we're all here cause he could just hit you once in the head.

431
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:19,739
He's got that potion. Nice. Oh, that's barely. Mine came down a half second before his.

432
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:27,659
I'm gonna use a campfire right here. Okay. Yeah. For you guys. Now it's good to take them both.

433
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:35,960
Use your heals guys. These are solo. I just drank one. Drank one bandaging. Drop that health pot for

434
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:46,409
you too. That's two different groups. We're doing all right. We are rolling right now. We are rolling

435
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:56,019
them. I killed the archer too. Grab that potion. Yep. Yeah. You got the archer too. That's huge.

436
00:57:56,019 --> 00:58:01,940
Getting skunked off these potions right now. I dropped another health pot for you guys.

437
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:10,099
Oh my God. This morning star. No cleric though. Make sure you guys fully heal and then move

438
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:14,519
forward. I'm just trying to take a shoot on this. There's a pendant on them too. There's a good

439
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:23,110
pendant on them. Oh, physical healing. Cool. I'll take it. All right. I got the killing blow. I

440
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:26,789
don't have any, I'm taking the loot. Yeah. Take as much of that as you want. Go crazy. I'm just

441
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:30,550
kidding. I don't, I don't really care. We gotta go crazy. Go crazy man. We gotta move too. We gotta

442
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:41,179
move. Okay. Those are good. Those are good. Helmet. Good. Circles coming. Also as a barbarian,

443
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:48,409
you have these like throwing axes. Yeah. They're really good. It slows them too. It's really good.

444
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:55,849
Did you get the morning star off that person? Uh. I'm gonna. Oh, you got it? Yeah. No,

445
00:58:55,849 --> 00:59:05,780
just sell it. You can just sell it. All right. Let's move. All right. Oil lanterns explode.

446
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,489
Oil lanterns sell for a shit load of money by the way. Yeah, I sell them. It's good money.

447
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:24,659
They sell for like 25 gold each. Can't move. I am. I think I've bugged my character.

448
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,059
What's wrong? Never mind. Never mind. Never mind. There's an F to cancel so you don't throw.

449
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:34,699
Oh yeah. You have to like. You can't like switch weapons or do anything else. The game is a little

450
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:38,380
buggy. Sometimes you'll swing and you won't swing and sometimes you'll just keep swinging for no

451
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:45,750
reason. Yeah. Happens to me a lot. We should probably start to look for a way out. Like we

452
00:59:45,750 --> 01:00:06,469
should probably generally try to get out of here. Yeah. It should be popping up now. Kind of good.

453
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:11,909
Oh, shoes for you if you want those shoes. Oh shit. Those are good.

454
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:26,679
Should go this way. Okay. It's sneak to the right here. Don't do aggro.

455
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:36,179
Yeah. This room is hell. Yep. Yeah. This room seriously is where it's like so many people die.

456
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:44,820
That Wraith that that's like a boss. Yeah. I see green eye entities. Yep. That's a more confidence

457
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,699
room. I don't know if we have that at the moment. I got to get used to the range on these.

458
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:59,460
This Y hander really was like training weights in terms of reach. Yeah. Watch out through the

459
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:08,219
hole here on the right. Oh my God. I'm sad. I don't want to swing because it's a horizontal

460
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,460
swing and I will hit one of you in the head with this insanely powerful weapon. Yeah.

461
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,119
I would feel so awful about it. So I'm just not going to do it. It'd be funny though.

462
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:26,280
It would. I would be very, very funny. All right. Shit's on his weight around here.

463
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:42,840
Spun up soon. Oh, be careful here. Whoa. What was that? What happened? What happened?

464
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,360
You got hit in the back by the pendulum. Oh, I thought there were only two.

465
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:53,159
Oh, shit. What the fuck is happening? I thought it was only three heels. I got heels. I think

466
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,920
I thought it was three. I didn't even know the other one was moving.

467
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:03,480
I've never seen four. I've only seen three. Oh, God. Escape at the end of it.

468
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:10,730
There's one there. Hey, hey, boys. I'm just saying I'm fucking out of here. Yeah, go for it.

469
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:22,150
Here, take the shit. I'll open it for you. Appreciate it. All right. Yeah. Here's something else.

470
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:27,079
Good luck. Have fun. We should be able to find one right here.

471
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:40,170
Just in case there's a fight. I just want to make sure. All right. Good luck. Be careful here.

472
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,769
All right. Take it before I do. Yeah. I've dropped those on the ground.

473
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:49,349
I dropped healing on the ground for you. Oh, there's three next to me. Oh, nice. Yeah.

474
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:56,170
Get out, get out, get out. Oh, nice. One of them's slightly more dangerous. I'll take the

475
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:04,300
I'll take the dangerous one already. Hell yeah. That was a good one. That's a clean one. Nice.

476
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:12,389
Good job, guys. Oh, yeah. And we killed like two groups also when we got looted.

477
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:23,690
Yeah, that worked out pretty well. I feel good about that one. Okay. Since we're cocky as hell,

478
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:32,659
we should do a high roller for fun. All right. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. It's very scary.

479
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:37,940
Yeah. So whatever, the ship wipes in two days anyway. Yeah. For just let's go to labs.

480
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:43,349
Do we all have to pay for it? It's a hundred. So collect a hundred, get a lot of heals,

481
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:49,429
just get a lot of the cheap heals, get the healing potions and the alchemist, the bandages. Okay.

482
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:54,570
We got this. Okay. All right. Let's get scary. It's going to be scary. Yeah. Let's take a second.

483
01:03:54,570 --> 01:04:01,639
Make sure you got all your shit or you got what you want. We'll go for it. Okay. Let me do this.

484
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:05,480
I just wanted to say that thanks to you, I have a seventy five percent survival

485
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,800
rate in this game, which I think is you're really going to mess up our matchmaking.

486
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:24,630
I don't think there even is matchmaking. Cool. All right. So, okay. So collector is all the

487
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:38,409
goblets and stuff. I don't even know who all the merchants are and buy a shitload of potions.

488
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:53,019
Oh, how much would you how much should we get? How many stacks of potions like three? I think

489
01:04:53,019 --> 01:05:08,809
I'm going to fill an entire slot with potions. Oh, I can't buy that. Any of you guys need gloves?

490
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:17,179
I don't have a hundred gold yet, but hold on. If you sell everything, I'm working on it.

491
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:23,219
Yeah. I'm buying this whole stock of potions. Is that stupid? The thing was I'm so poor that

492
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:31,699
I spent thirty six gold just on like heals in the last two counters. We can do one more normal

493
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:37,269
if you want. I think I'm ready for it. Let's let's go. Let's do a high roll. Let's do it.

494
01:05:37,269 --> 01:05:44,070
By the way, oil lanterns really do sell for twenty. I don't know why they sell for so much.

495
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:57,030
That's crazy. How do you stack? Is it like a is it like a wallet? Yes. You buy the gold coin

496
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:07,239
purses and then go. Oh, of course. So should I just be selling like all the extra armor and weapons

497
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:14,900
and stuff vendor or like should I save those for player market or what? Anything that you. Yeah.

498
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,340
Anything that you get that's like blue or better, especially if it's purple,

499
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:24,309
if it's for the wrong class. I mean, trading it is how you I mean, selling it was probably

500
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:31,099
not a great idea because you can just trade it to another player. But I mean, at this stage in the

501
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:36,460
demo, I would just just sell everything and keep some stuff. If you have another character you

502
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:40,380
want to play with, then you can do sort of the oh, I'm going to go in a game and drop this on

503
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:46,570
the ground. Please give it to my ranger when I make it right. But I haven't done any trading or

504
01:06:46,570 --> 01:07:04,730
anything. I'm just kind of playing. I am going to do this, though. I gambled again. You said oil

505
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:11,079
lanterns are pretty good to sell. Yep. They were twenty three. Who's the who's the weapon guy?

506
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:28,900
The weapon guy. OK. Yeah. OK. I am. OK. I am ready to try this hard mode.

507
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:40,440
Got a ton of heels. I got a full set of gear. It's pretty good stuff. I think I'm ready. All

508
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:47,699
right. I'm ready. How do you get the high roller ticket or what do you have to do to get in? I

509
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:53,559
think I just have to pay for it. Oh, OK. So it's like, are we ready to fight robots? We all take

510
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:59,380
a hundred. Everybody has to pay. Do you have a hundred gold? I just got. Yeah, I just traded up

511
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:07,940
to it. How about this? We die. If we die, we go into the normal with nothing and go zero to hero.

512
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:13,829
Yeah, that's good. I think I have like one hundred and thirty eight gold and some silver. Perfect.

513
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:18,550
All right, let's do it. You ready? Everybody get your money. Get you get your wallet out.

514
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:27,850
We're splitting this check three ways. OK, if you bring a second weapon, does that like weigh you

515
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:36,250
down like you're slower? I think it's only if you've equipped. OK, so like a primary secondary is

516
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:45,000
fine to have. Yeah, if you have primaries, but I just make sure it's not equipped. If you don't

517
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,239
remind me to ignore you earlier, I had to go pee, but I didn't want to say I want to have to go pee.

518
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:58,380
You know what I'm saying? When you ignored me, when did you ignore me? Yeah, I didn't. I'm so sorry.

519
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,060
You didn't do it. You didn't do anything in this stream. What do you call it? I'm ready.

520
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,619
You don't have to apologize for anything. You didn't do anything wrong. All right. You ready?

521
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:13,109
I won't do it again. I just read your message. Yeah, whatever you're doing. Yeah. What?

522
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:28,279
All right. I'm president. Oh, here we go. So like with the felling axe, I feel like I have

523
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:33,800
to get danger close to anything to hit. Kind of. But it hits the head really hard, though. OK.

524
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:39,109
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, just got to click on the head faster. But how do we close the gap

525
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:47,510
when they're faster than me? So there's like, I rebind my holster to like mouse button.

526
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,909
That's a good idea. I just, I holster all the time when I'm running to people. And if you jump

527
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:57,109
and holster in the air, you like, there's like some tech to it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah,

528
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:04,439
yeah. Like CS, CS go jumping. Oh, we got, we got gambler. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So we got,

529
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:10,180
we got some, we got gambler. If only, if one of us survives, people are betting on it. All right.

530
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:18,069
Let's see. Only one of us has to survive this. Good luck, believers and non-believers, except

531
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:39,289
non-believers, you fucked up. I'm just saying you fucked up. I'm a high roller. I didn't get it in

532
01:10:39,289 --> 01:10:50,979
time. Oh, they heard that. Oh, they did. Yeah, they heard nothing but, oh fuck. I don't even have a

533
01:10:50,979 --> 01:11:03,319
torso piece. I'm, I'm, I'm taking this to the next level here. So is this a different map poke or is

534
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:06,600
this the same one, but just everything's harder? There's a chance to get a Colosseum map, but

535
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,319
usually it's the same map. Okay. Um, the rebind didn't work. Okay. No, listen, listen, listen. Oh

536
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:21,260
God, every monster moves faster and they're scary. What? Oh my God. It does move so fast. I missed.

537
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:32,149
Okay. We did that. That was so fast. Ooh. Oh my God. I had a ring. The loot is a lot better. Wow.

538
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:40,329
All right. This is cool. All right. I'm just going to follow you. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

539
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:47,739
Okay. Okay. Okay. I learned this today. Yeah. Listen, there's a way to kill this boss without

540
01:11:47,739 --> 01:11:54,300
taking damage. So I'm going to try it. Okay. Oh, I'm going this way. I'm going this way. Wish me luck.

541
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:03,529
High roller. Let's go without taking any damage. Oh, people across. They're coming. Get the, get

542
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:09,340
out of here, buddy. Are you friendly? Oh, okay. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh,

543
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,500
nevermind. Run, run, run. This guy aggroed the whole world. Oh, you do. You aggroed everything.

544
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:21,340
What are you doing? We're high rollers. In this door. Oh my God. He just brought everything over

545
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:28,310
here. Close them out. Close, close, close, close, close. State your name. We're good. We're good.

546
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:36,520
State your name. What's your, what's your name? Name is Ethan. I'm Ethan. Okay. Ethan, you look

547
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:42,489
like you got a lot of good shit. No, I'm, I came in here with grace. I came in here with grace.

548
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:52,470
Okay. All right. You can live. Hey, it's better to have four than three. Which one do you use?

549
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:59,340
Huh? Shout out the substream. Shout out the substream. It's for you. This is for you.

550
01:13:03,989 --> 01:13:13,930
Oh, okay. Now I see his name. If Poke just couldn't take the shout out, he couldn't take like the

551
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:17,289
fucking shout out. No, no, no. I thought he was going to say something bad or something.

552
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:23,130
He's like, I got my moment. Oh, you thought, you thought he was going to just start screaming

553
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:28,890
wicked awful shit. Oh, that's true. All right. Yeah. You met. Yep. Yep. Which one's Jerma?

554
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:39,289
I was like, wait, what? That's true. That's true. I got scared. It's like, I don't know. I don't

555
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:45,430
know. Oh my God. Uh, you know what? Like, like good on you though. Like appreciate it looking

556
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:50,329
out. I'm sorry. You're looking out for us. That's, that's good. Sorry, Ethan. Yeah. He thought, he

557
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:53,609
thought you're going to scream a bunch of terrible things into the mic. The developer just messaged

558
01:13:53,609 --> 01:14:01,130
me and said, we can't group up with four or so. All right. Hard jump. Uh huh. I missed it.

559
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:08,539
God damn it. I'm actually so fucking mad because I'm dead down here. Do not be like me. Make that

560
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:14,470
jump. I'll make it over. There's a boss following me. Yeah. Oh wait, you can jump up here. Other

561
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:19,960
players, other players coming across. No, they're not friendly. What do I go from here? I forget

562
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:28,420
this whole map. Uh, you gotta come back. We're friendly. We're friendly. Come. Who the fuck is

563
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:34,819
this guy? That's like, he's in the party with the guy you just said is friendly. All right. We're

564
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:46,420
good. Wait, is this your, are you all teammates? Who is this? Who are you? Yes. You a high roller?

565
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:52,970
I am your communion. Drink from me. Are you a high roller or are you, what are you? I'm like stuck.

566
01:14:54,010 --> 01:15:02,149
Here comes the wall. What did he say? He said, I am your communion. Drink from me.

567
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:11,609
All right. Hey, you need to relax. Um, the wall. Yeah, we got to get out of here. We have to leave.

568
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:16,600
Jump past these guys. Ready? You're gonna. Oh Jesus. Oh God. We're not going that way.

569
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:30,409
Oh, you're not that way. I think I'm with you. No. Yep. We, we wrapped back around. Yeah. Okay.

570
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:37,399
We're good. We're good. Who's this guy? You're friendly. Okay. Like seven or eight friendlies

571
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:46,520
here. Yeah. It's the whole dungeon is friendly apparently. I feel bad for Ethan. That's, that

572
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:59,960
was so funny. All guys just looted up. I know just met six. Hey, why not? Oh, look at all these

573
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:06,619
heels. A lot of stuff here. All been looted. We should probably make our way towards the circle

574
01:16:06,619 --> 01:16:16,100
though. Yeah. Watch out for this. Okay. All right. Watch out for the thing you said to watch out for

575
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:22,100
you. Yeah. I jumped it. I fucking, I'm an idiot. So if we find food and we don't know what it is,

576
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:33,880
are you guys going to test it to make sure it's not poisonous? I think there'll be people here.

577
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:39,210
There's a lot of people. We have like an entire Warcraft raid. I think we're going to be all right.

578
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:47,100
We have a whole five man Warcraft dungeon group. People's people coughing in here.

579
01:16:49,420 --> 01:17:01,029
I can't breathe. That shit's making me choke. How long does it take to die in there? Like one. Oh

580
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:14,649
my God. It's chasing me. Okay. This is the way the developers intended the game to be played.

581
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:34,760
Actually kind of true. I hear fighting going on. We're good. Kill this archer. I'm starting to

582
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,760
forget who is friendly. We have to, there's too many people claiming to be friendly that I'm going

583
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,699
to turn around and kill somebody. If I had a Zwei hander, that's basically what I would do.

584
01:17:43,699 --> 01:18:08,779
I would just do a big wide swing. Ow. So many fucking spiders. Uh oh. That guy is getting

585
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:19,750
chased by four different entities. Okay. We're good. We're good. Oh my God. I almost just hit you

586
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:31,859
twice. I don't know how. Thank you. Uh huh. I did something. Yeah. Just like loot up for sure.

587
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:36,020
Just pick up everything. Yeah. You guys did as much as you can. Even the boxes are like

588
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:45,319
barrels. I said, Hey, can you please do a world record bong hit? Um, no, I'm good. Not right now.

589
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:53,560
Actually, uh, talk to you. Take this shrine. We're okay. I'm here reporting. This is a power shrine.

590
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,479
You'll hit for way more. You did one earlier. Yeah. I mean, I already, I broke the world record

591
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:09,289
earlier. I have to do it again. Like shut up. Is it true that you swing faster if you duck in the

592
01:19:09,289 --> 01:19:23,260
middle of a felling acts? Well, I don't know that speed. Oh, did you get the smash perk?

593
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:29,079
You can break walls and stuff. Yeah. Oh, you can break doors. I didn't tell you break a door

594
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:36,279
and you can break chests. Yeah. With the felling acts, even chests. Oh, bad guys. Uh, there's a

595
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:43,159
party in here, like a different party, like two parties. Actually, I'm shooting at them.

596
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:56,869
There's one to our left. Let's go. I think there's an invisible guy at like one 95 rogue. All right.

597
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,710
They're getting to be too many people around. I don't know who's friendly,

598
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:06,199
so just be aware of that. I don't know. You might die from, I might accidentally hit you.

599
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:12,520
Oh, is this the guy that has to play among us in every game? That's too hard of a decision.

600
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:21,029
Send your minions to fight these guys. Hey, go fight those people.

601
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:34,840
Hey, send your minions. I'm playing a necromancer. It's all fun and games until

602
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,840
there's only one portal for all nine of us. Yeah. When there's one portal left, I'm sorry,

603
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:49,000
but I'm just swinging this down there guys. It's right here. The bad guy. That's a bad guy.

604
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:56,659
Are you friendly? All right. Well, then it looks like you looks like you and I are going to have a

605
01:20:56,659 --> 01:21:16,810
one V one of one of my minions. Oh no. Let me do this. Yeah. This guy had gear. Get him,

606
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:23,479
get him, kill him. I demand it right here. Right here. Guys, on this body right here.

607
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:42,149
Uh, come get this weapon. This guy right here. Oh my fucking God. Get this shit off my character.

608
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:54,500
This is my portal. Wait, is yours? Okay. Where's mine? The one there's a guy up there finding one

609
01:21:54,500 --> 01:22:01,670
for you. Oh, okay. You go up there. I really don't have much shit. So if I die, it's all good.

610
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:05,590
You know, you need to make shit. No, you need to make some shit though. Yeah. But I haven't been

611
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:11,130
looting anything because there's nine people in our party. Uh, so it's like locusts. Just kill them

612
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:26,069
all. There's only red portals up here. It's only red portals. Uh, did they take the, oh no, we can't

613
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:34,659
go. No, there's one portal here. I got one here. Oh no, I got one here. Alex, be, be good. Uh,

614
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:41,430
I'm being chased by a mimic. I'm just leaving. I have to go in the red. I have to go in the red.

615
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:47,020
Oh, you went wait. I'm the last man standing. You have to get up here. Oh, you have to get

616
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,460
up here. Go on the red, go on the red, go on the red. It's all good. Yeah, but no, but it's,

617
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,380
you go to the next dungeon. Like you guys going to go to the next one. You're good. It's not,

618
01:22:54,380 --> 01:23:01,180
you can make it. You might not. I'm one with the darkness. Oh shit. Oh, I'm sorry. You guys

619
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:06,949
gotta explain this shit before the critical moment. I thought there'd be more portals, but

620
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:10,789
that was unlucky. Well, to be fair on that round, there were like nine people.

621
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:23,350
It was kind of an interesting one. Is it time to watch poke clear this whole dungeon? No, I'm just

622
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:29,479
going to die. Oh, are you dead too? No, he's in the next dungeon. Oh, he took red and you took

623
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:37,270
blue. Yeah. I just left. I thought we were just leaving. Sorry. Poke is going to literally kill

624
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:47,960
the boss right now. No, I'm extracting or something. No, no, no. I honestly want to watch. Yeah. Oh,

625
01:23:47,960 --> 01:24:03,369
I can't see anything guys. Smart. Smart. Somebody said, I swear poking through a blue portal. Yeah,

626
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:12,300
I thought you did leave poke. Oh my God. What the fuck is that? Is that a person that just ran

627
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:22,149
there? Someone ran there and died. Look at these strats. I took your portal. I did. Oh, I thought

628
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:37,340
you were just kind of, you just were gone. Oops. This is big brain. Yeah, it is. What do you have

629
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:45,960
for a bow? Let me see. That's pretty good. Oh, you can look at the inventory. Oh yeah. Hit tab. You

630
01:24:45,960 --> 01:25:03,750
got some, you got some good shit in here poke. Yeah. I want to get out. Oh no. Has a reflective

631
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:13,579
shield. It hurts you. Did this standing on the light post is this is, this is working out really

632
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:36,310
well. So like, you're going to get out of here. No, it's infinite arrows, but you do have to reload.

633
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:43,579
Okay. I think if you play it safe, I think you actually will get out of here. I don't think,

634
01:25:43,579 --> 01:25:46,939
I don't think anybody else is even in here or did anybody else take it? How can you take, can you

635
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:56,359
tell? Someone ran here and just died over there. Oh yeah, they did. So they might've dropped all

636
01:25:56,359 --> 01:26:08,409
their shit from the last. Okay. You did the movie thing where you only hit the bars, you know,

637
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:11,850
like when the villain is shooting like an automatic weapon and the hero's running on

638
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:17,689
like a catwalk and every bullet just inexplicably sparks off of the side rail. That's what you just

639
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:27,619
did. Like and they're always putting their hands up kind of like that's somehow protecting them

640
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:32,180
from the bolts. Yeah. If you cover your face and you don't look at the sparks, you're safer. Yeah.

641
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:39,909
And then they're never, they're never firing back. They're always like running. You gotta outrun the

642
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:44,229
bullets. Yep. You just, you just run out, run no matter, even the bullets are hitting where you

643
01:26:44,229 --> 01:27:00,659
are. Some good loot. What do you have? I'm gonna look at your inventory. So purples probably are

644
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:05,220
down here like crazy then in here in high roller, I would imagine. I like these pants. I just found

645
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:12,729
these frock or just see that. That's real. Plus two physical power plus two healing. Good for a

646
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:32,119
cleric. Oh no. What is that? It's a centaur. There are centaurs. Yeah. Good luck with that.

647
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:39,640
This is a, this is a boss room. I figured what boss this is. That looks like a boss. Yeah. I,

648
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:45,670
I don't know. I think you just get out of here. They try to run there. Open the door.

649
01:27:45,670 --> 01:28:10,890
Is this the only avenue? Oh, nice. Do the skeletons fight the boss? I don't think so. No,

650
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:27,399
something killed the skeletons in there. Maybe they were summons. Hey, this is my buddy, Eric.

651
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:46,170
Oh, when you get far enough away, he unsummons the skeletons. He's like a necromancer. I enjoy

652
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:50,250
the lore of the necromancer who waits thousands of years for you to come through. But like when

653
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:59,130
you leave his section of the park, he, um, he gets sad. His animatronic turns off. Oh,

654
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:14,460
he has to go through his like Freddy Fazbear routine. Oh, okay. You can open the door in the

655
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:27,239
right. Right. It's like watching a, it's like watching a little movie. I love this. Yeah. Oh

656
01:29:27,239 --> 01:30:13,020
God folk. They move so fast. You weren't kidding. Good shit in here. No, sorry for holding you guys

657
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:18,220
up, man. No, it's no, I like watching this. Yeah. I, I, this is good to see what's going on in here.

658
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:35,449
Oh my God. Oh man. Oh, no way. Is this going to work? My friend. Oh, that was a noble sacrifice.

659
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:46,310
That was a noble sacrifice. I got out. Nice. Nice. That's huge. Hey, I'll get you one of you guys

660
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:55,079
pants. That is really good. I like pants. I got a, I got a lot of blue. I got both of you pants.

661
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:01,140
You guys bring your pants at home. I got y'all pants. Yeah. Just leave your pants. Yeah. Already

662
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:08,760
done. I got a few. Can't believe I got out. High roller red place is really hard. No. Yeah. That's

663
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,529
awesome. You can, you got like a purple too. Yeah. You got the, you didn't get the best experience

664
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:19,619
though for high roller. You had to fight like 10 Ethan's 10 Ethan encounters. Let's call them

665
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:27,220
Ethan though. Yeah. An Ethan encounter did show up a few times here. Guys, no more Ethan's. Okay.

666
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:36,789
Yeah. When you show up, you show up with blood lust. Yeah. Fight us. No more Ethan's. Oh man.

667
01:31:36,789 --> 01:31:41,029
All right. Let's go. Like if you're going to snipe, like try to scare us and make it like funny, like

668
01:31:41,989 --> 01:31:47,220
try to kill us. Actually, Ethan was really funny because you thought Ethan was going to like scream

669
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:53,220
a bunch of bad words. So that was actually my moment. That was a pretty great moment. That was

670
01:31:53,220 --> 01:32:01,539
a great moment. Okay. I assume we're not recueing for that because I am broke. Yeah. We'll go normal.

671
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:10,569
Yeah. We'll do a normal one. Uh, I'll bring you a gray felling X just for now. Okay. I'll take it.

672
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:16,710
It's so funny just how much that wiped out my bank account though. It's like, it was almost two rows,

673
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:25,260
like two, almost a whole, like a whole row. We'll get stuff down. I'm ready. All right. I just want

674
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:34,039
to make sure I don't, I just want to bring, you know, I don't want to bring anything good. All

675
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:39,000
right. I'm happy with this. I'm happy with that. I got my long sword. Shit looks pretty good. All

676
01:32:39,000 --> 01:33:10,020
right. I'm good to go. Everybody ready? Yep. Should be good. Go. Oh shit. I forgot I was wearing this.

677
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:20,789
What do you have? I got nothing, dude. Oh shit. What do you mean? What do you have? That was,

678
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:29,399
you took me into the high roller in my fifth game. I lost it all. Hey, but now you have experience

679
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:37,109
there. We did a, we did a $100 max bat single spin. Yeah. And then accidentally ran into like

680
01:33:37,109 --> 01:33:43,750
eight other people in the same slot. Yeah. There were like 10 people at the same slot machine,

681
01:33:43,750 --> 01:34:02,420
all like reaching for the max bet. Ooh, trying to get a grasp of like armor ratings. Oh, I was

682
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:16,550
muted. Talking to myself. Sorry about that. Okay. I'm ready. Fuck. Wait. Unarmed the builds. Here,

683
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:22,180
someone take this pants. Shit. I didn't bring any torches. I'm an idiot. I got one. I got an extra

684
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:32,260
torch here. Oh, awesome. Uh, I'll take these pants. Why not? And I'll take that torch. All right.

685
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:48,060
Nice. Collect. All right. You can stand here in the middle and cleave them all. Wait, who or

686
01:34:48,699 --> 01:34:59,260
anything? You gave me a felling axe. He can cleave. Maybe I can't. I don't know if you can. I can't

687
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:15,159
on my third swing. All right. Okay. There's been such a massive debate on this. How do you open a,

688
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:22,100
how do you do the lockpicking? It seems impossible. How would you, how do you do it? This one's not,

689
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,140
but it usually is. You press space when it hits it. It's okay. I thought it was like, like it's space.

690
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:39,109
Yeah, it's space. Is there a lockpicking minigame? Yeah. And does it have to be in the yellow or the

691
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:47,159
red? Yellow. I don't know what the red does. I'll be honest. Yeah. It says space on the screen. Yeah,

692
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:54,810
but it's on the, that shit's on the screen for like a 10th of a second. Is smashing the chest

693
01:35:54,810 --> 01:36:01,750
better than picking them? Do you like lose any loot? Uh, no, it's better to kill. I think someone's

694
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:11,000
here. Oh, people here. Are you friendly? I thought we were. Oh, bad guys. I think he's scary. Okay.

695
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,539
Do we want to get out of this hallway? Is it a mage? It was a skeleton. Oh,

696
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:47,609
you'll see what I mean. Go look at them. Let's see. Okay. Nobody here. Something. You're right.

697
01:36:47,609 --> 01:36:51,449
Nobody's here. Somebody here. Oh, people come through the door right now. Spider.

698
01:36:52,329 --> 01:37:03,460
Oh, no. Yep. I'm watching her. Six. Oh, they're doing the same thing. Be careful. They're shooting

699
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:11,859
through the hole too. I hit him. I killed him. I killed him. What? Holy shit. Did you really?

700
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:19,909
Yeah. Who's this guy? I killed that guy. I killed that guy. Oh, there's another guy. What the fuck

701
01:37:19,909 --> 01:37:25,750
is this? It's a rogue. Yes. One more guy. One more guy in here. He's low. He's low. He's low. He's low.

702
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:32,739
He ran to the right. Get it. Go get him. I don't know. Down. Maybe he closes his door. I'm pretty

703
01:37:32,739 --> 01:37:44,300
sure we should loot. Hey, go loot. Go loot. So rogues can just be invisible. Yeah. It's like a

704
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:55,000
cool down. It's like for like 30 seconds. Yeah. You can't do it for that long. Okay. I didn't kill

705
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,079
the cleric. He got away. Dude, that skeleton skin is seriously complete. It's so that's OP.

706
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:16,060
You I just think that you're an enemy in the game. Yeah. That's crazy. Okay. Okay. Let's keep running.

707
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:24,840
Are we good? Yeah. If you got some potions. Good potions. Gloves right here. I just have a potion

708
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:35,779
of protection. That's it. Here. Take these two and use them. We use one at least. I also picked

709
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:43,500
up a campfire off one of them. I wonder where they are. I have no idea. You guys see anybody?

710
01:38:43,579 --> 01:38:48,310
No. Yeah. That that person got away and it's really interesting that they did because if we

711
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:55,210
ever if we ever saw them that would be bad for them. It would be awful for them. Let's just keep

712
01:38:55,210 --> 01:39:14,329
going then. Top it up. Must have been the wind. Just remember we'll let you live today. I put a

713
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:26,659
trap. We're just like waiting for the comedy moment to happen right now. You're just sitting there.

714
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:48,250
Just ready. He doesn't even have the voice on. He just like okay whatever. All I'm saying if

715
01:39:48,329 --> 01:39:54,840
he gets in a portal at the end I'm gonna be pissed. He's gonna take our portal. That's what I mean.

716
01:39:58,149 --> 01:40:03,510
We gotta get out this way. Where the hell are you guys going? I've been back and forth across

717
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:07,689
this guy's hallway. There's guys up there. I think we were just waiting to see what this guy was

718
01:40:07,689 --> 01:40:16,470
gonna do. What are you doing over there? You're not gonna kill me. What are you doing? Oh you

719
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:37,979
killed me. That hurt a lot. I'm dead. I just killed you. Oh I'm dead but I got three hits on

720
01:40:37,979 --> 01:40:47,590
him. Uh oh. Wait the friend. Where's the friend? The cleric friend. Where's the cleric friend?

721
01:40:47,590 --> 01:41:07,380
Where's the cleric friend? I didn't know that does that. What was that? Oh Jerm I'm so sorry

722
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:13,060
you walked into my bullet. That was so. No dude don't worry about it. I'm an idiot. I got hit.

723
01:41:13,939 --> 01:41:20,760
No it was me. Damn it. As long as it was funny. And hey why don't we spectate our um cleric friend?

724
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:38,390
Well. This is them right here right? Why indeed. Where are they? Sorry. No dude this game is

725
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:44,279
fucking a mess. Yeah it's all good. I was gonna die anyways. I was gonna take one more hit and

726
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:48,920
I was gonna die anyways. I'm just glad you killed him before I killed him. I love how you went to

727
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:56,699
punch him in the face though. That was funny. Your last dying wish was to just punch in the face.

728
01:41:56,939 --> 01:42:02,060
That cleric we saved should have helped us. I don't know where they went. He just maybe he

729
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:07,270
took an opportunity. He's probably not even. That's narrative set up and payoff. That person's

730
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:10,550
probably not even on voice chat like you said and they just probably like oh my god three people.

731
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:15,260
They're letting me live. And then just kind of went on with their day. You save a guy in act one

732
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:25,590
he doesn't show up for act three. What do you mean saved him? I mean I don't know. Well we killed.

733
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:30,310
Okay is it technically did we technically save him or do we yeah that's that's a weird way to say

734
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:37,100
that but if we didn't we killed we killed him we killed him from ourselves yes we spared him that's

735
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:47,000
better yeah we killed his two friends and spared him i see all right oh my rogue now poke is going

736
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:54,390
poke is going uh oh oh and you got one of those be a skeleton skin yeah you go to shop top right

737
01:42:54,390 --> 01:43:07,159
and you collect points every time you extract very cool very cool so you're gonna be scary

738
01:43:07,159 --> 01:43:12,119
you're gonna scare the okay good i like that you're gonna scare people yeah all right i'm

739
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:18,539
bringing uh i'm gonna bring this blue halberd and let's go i have a sweet hander anyone want one

740
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:21,979
actually i i will take that i'll take this render i'll bring two of them then i have two of them is

741
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:31,609
the birdish good uh is yours white yeah it's just white i'll bring you i'll bring you weapon

742
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:57,350
okay rogue i like your name thank you okay you said you said you are you are bringing a weapon

743
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:03,300
yeah i'm bringing you guys two sweet handers i don't like them though they're not that good

744
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:08,649
they're kind of annoying to use because you can only use them you can't use them in a hallway

745
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:13,449
yeah you have to use like the right click which is okay but um i don't think the upswing like

746
01:44:13,449 --> 01:44:21,720
hits anything vital like the head yeah it's not worth it what's your favorite what's your favorite

747
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:30,579
class what's like you think is the best one um i really like i like playing rogue i think they're

748
01:44:30,579 --> 01:44:35,930
fun to fuck around with i would have guessed that from the jumping onto the chalice strat you can do

749
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:40,569
fun stuff was as rogue you can get like a thing where you fast right yeah you're fast and you

750
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:46,010
could stealth and move like 10 seconds uh 10 steps in stealth then you could like outplay them

751
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:56,060
trick them you know yeah it's this game's fun i like it a lot i'm ready all right let's go for it

752
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:01,689
i love this game it's a really good game yeah it makes a strong first impression i'm just looking

753
01:45:01,689 --> 01:45:08,250
forward to more just like pve stuff more like maps i think it it has a lot of potential for sure

754
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:17,180
just hope that they get it at the right get it the right way how would elmo play this game

755
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:23,140
elmo's not old enough to play this like what what a what a dumb question are you trying to

756
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:32,439
get a voice yeah is it elmo like 50 yeah almost like in his like mid 40s wait that's right no

757
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:47,159
isn't elmo like four how old is elmo he's three yeah no he elmo is supposed to be three years old

758
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:55,029
oh yeah just oh nice nice nice yeah you take the blue i'll take the green oh this is an annoying

759
01:45:55,029 --> 01:46:08,949
room nice i'm really strong okay we have to take turns not killing you yeah i i don't i'm

760
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:17,739
i don't want to swing because i'm gonna kill somebody nice oh what do you have let me i can't

761
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:22,539
expect you but you probably have some cool shit on this character oh yeah i'm really really really

762
01:46:22,539 --> 01:46:30,630
yeah real strong what the you just went like a golf club who i was trying to figure out what the

763
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:44,949
hell it was hitting a wizard sword oh great two archers yeah now let's go yeah i don't like that

764
01:46:44,949 --> 01:47:00,579
route that route stinks you could break the door yeah but the fucking weapon it just try it again

765
01:47:00,579 --> 01:47:07,689
no get you got to get it i have to do it from this angle i thought you were going to get me

766
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:18,859
with the backstroke for a second there oh lockpick yeah so how do you is do you have any lockpicks on

767
01:47:18,859 --> 01:47:28,899
you no do you do you have the perk to do i have it you got it oh my god uh yeah battle axe oh yeah

768
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:43,500
kind of kind of junk that barefoot sound yeah the penguin slap you just scared the shit out of me

769
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:49,060
by the way i saw a person walk up in my peripheral and i freaked out trying to dodge all the spike

770
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:56,550
traps there's a double axe in here is that good for barbarian probably right it's just a gray

771
01:47:56,550 --> 01:48:04,470
yeah it's how to get take this uh this battle axe in here 50 damage you probably would like it maybe

772
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:14,100
more than that if you if you don't like this way under i like the range of the this sword

773
01:48:15,369 --> 01:48:21,909
yeah it's just i can't figure out why the upswing is like hitting something it's weird it doesn't

774
01:48:21,909 --> 01:48:29,180
have a weird swing all right we're gonna make our way out of here you know this spot right here

775
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:45,640
oh secret this takes you all the way across okay that's that's good to know i think i've done this

776
01:48:45,640 --> 01:49:00,600
accident like once or twice but it's good to know that it's here this game is kind of like

830
01:57:45,979 --> 01:57:51,779
to cycle in his bunch of people today all right i'll do one more let's do it right dude if you if

831
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:58,069
you keep playing this are you playing and playing this like long term yeah i play a lot because hey

832
01:57:58,069 --> 01:58:12,979
should fucking play again gotta get back into like organizing stash mentality for this game

833
01:58:12,979 --> 01:58:21,850
i know hold on what's done we gotta get uh me you and stir i used to play a lot with stir

834
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:30,250
yeah stir uh i don't know if i don't know if that's gonna uh stir is hey he enjoyed his time in the

835
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:34,970
game he enjoyed his time in the case this game i didn't say that i said he enjoyed his time in

836
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:47,020
the game he had a lot of fun in he hates it i don't think stir hates the game he had his he had fun

837
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:58,090
in the game when we played it two days ago i'll try to convince them yeah maybe you can all right

838
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:04,500
sorry i'm just buying potions this is a lot to take in you're doing great you're owning

839
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:11,220
now honest to god you're doing fantastically literally installing the game my secret is letting

840
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:19,779
you go through the door first he said on his stream that he hates it okay well i didn't say

841
01:59:19,779 --> 01:59:35,880
that so he leaked it himself we are ready to go i think those stir hatings the game like this

842
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:44,520
is actually directly proportional to how much he actually enjoys it um i think he he liked it but

843
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:53,000
he didn't really love it but that means he loves it possibly although me him and i had a huge

844
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,220
vampire survivor's argument so i don't know i tried to convince him for like an hour straight

845
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:06,539
on stream one time and it just didn't work why isn't like that game too no he could probably tell

846
02:00:06,539 --> 02:00:15,670
you every reason why he's he's very opinionated he's very opinionated aren't we all yeah we are

847
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:28,310
that's all right oh shit i don't know what's what who i don't know who's doing that but that's cool

848
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:34,020
what there's a chest in there oh there's a there's a secret

849
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:45,020
there was a trinket oh okay yeah that's like a boss peace if you if you're under him he can't

850
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:55,779
hit you wow this is actually working holy shit that thing is usually a horrendous thing to deal

851
02:00:55,779 --> 02:01:09,000
with oh horseman's axe okay do you want to try a one-hander me yeah uh i don't know i like the

852
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,960
range of this but i can i can just hear it out take a look it's not a bad one too

853
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:22,890
trader can barbarians put on a shield or no no one hitter probably pretty bad then

854
02:01:22,890 --> 02:01:38,460

857
02:01:51,420 --> 02:02:04,220
amulets and stuff they're really good oh bunny hopping is actually in the game okay you should

861
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,020
yeah it's it's the leveling is i know it's like oh shit like level five level 10 level 20 the

862
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:47,539
difference is almost nothing it's just being able to pick another perk it's it's really everybody's

870
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,220

871
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:24,170
thanks for dropping that they were all up in my face there's some other shit on here i don't want

872
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:32,539
to take it all use your right click yeah but even it's like uh uh yeah but still i feel like

873
02:04:32,539 --> 02:04:36,890
okay when i do the wind up does that hit don't blame me i don't know what the fuck you could

874
02:04:36,890 --> 02:04:42,810
have done honestly if i if i participated in that fight we would have lost yeah everyone

875
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:51,159
here i'll use the campfire for you oh okay yeah that'd be good wait do you have a surgical kit

876
02:04:51,159 --> 02:04:55,479
i got i got heels too if you want them i have a campfire kit extra i got three potions on the

877
02:04:55,479 --> 02:05:03,060
ground right here for you right here by me just just chug them well don't chug them but after

878
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:09,420
each other do you have to wait some guys some loot for money like before you drink another

879
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:16,460
potion do you have to wait till the bar stops flashing yes oh yeah there's uh some more

880
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:36,739
trinkets on here so i've seen a golden chest before but i couldn't open it is there have you

881
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:52,359
ever opened a golden chest book yeah it's nothing crazy oh oh those guys back there yeah i think

882
02:05:52,359 --> 02:05:59,909
that's probably who i saw they were in this room we just went through and then they ran that way

883
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:07,060
and then got killed oh you jumped down all right we uh oh watch out a lot of shit i don't think you

884
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:20,810
did never mind never mind oh we got the whole room coming oh yeah i see across across person

885
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:33,659
is concerning me mage we should just leave this yeah it's this it's never it's always bad yeah

886
02:06:34,579 --> 02:06:40,869
is there is there a tier of item rarity over purple oh legendary so that and that's in the

887
02:06:40,869 --> 02:06:45,989
play test right now is that orange yeah oh man i don't even know how you'd find one of those

888
02:06:45,989 --> 02:06:54,979
i bet someone would give you one right now you have but to ask i definitely don't want that

889
02:06:54,979 --> 02:07:01,460
yeah i feel you ruins the magic honestly if somebody came into a lobby and just dropped

890
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:09,109
like a legendary on the ground i just wouldn't even pick it up i'd throw it away so i'll take

891
02:07:09,109 --> 02:07:45,289
it and hide it oh that was a lot of money on this one don't shoot me god damn it circles coming in

892
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:57,210
this thing is hard to use i forgot so how often does the circle close uh often is there like a

893
02:07:57,210 --> 02:08:00,970
timer before it moves or it just randomly starts all people here in the middle it's probably every

894
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:11,430
couple minutes are we two or three minutes are we fighting somebody dead here i think they're

895
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:19,850
they're in trouble i think there's no one died here on the left just one looks like maybe two

896
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:39,670
a lot of enemies behind them though i killed them got one and there's a zombie's with me

897
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:45,430
i'm just i was trying to get rid of the zombie there's too much gas on there

898
02:08:52,300 --> 02:09:00,859
unfortunately the guy died in an awkward spot for loot oh my god oh i know he did

899
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:15,430
okay okay uh-oh more people no just i think i'm i went to go loot this guy and i separated myself

1024
02:27:08,549 --> 02:27:17,850
purple swayander uh if you trust me with it i don't want to i want to mess up it's all right

1025
02:27:17,930 --> 02:27:24,950
sure yeah i don't matter beta ends in three days i'm gonna i'm gonna go in with nothing

1026
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:33,450
in that case i'm thinking about saving that all right i'm sorry jerk no i get it you don't trust

1027
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:40,659
your yet you know i need to get your out there yeah wait jerk has to prove to me sure is is good

1028
02:27:40,659 --> 02:27:52,520
should i say jerk all right let me get it sure jerk jerk jerk jerk apologize to jerk right now

1029
02:27:52,520 --> 02:28:00,100
i i'm sorry i didn't mean that all right so um talks what was you said yeah trying learning

1030
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:07,379
about spell memory yes it if you have it's a it's amount of spells you can attune and

1031
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:11,590
you can only do a certain amount before you're kind of like over encumbered or something right

1032
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:16,149
is that how it works jerk if you could please you have any idea think of it it's like the number of

1033
02:28:16,149 --> 02:28:29,020
words you can know yeah i think that that makes sense do you have any favorite words uh yeah what's

1034
02:28:29,020 --> 02:28:37,370
your favorite word jerf um well i it's kind of like a joke what do you call a piece of dried

1035
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:52,010
jerf jerfy jerf jerfy yeah yeah like like beef jerky yeah yeah jerfy pretty cool beef jerfy my

1036
02:28:52,010 --> 02:29:01,690
favorite word is mayonnaise that's an interesting one why why because it's kind of it's a lot of

1037
02:29:01,690 --> 02:29:09,930
syllables and it's i like it a lot yeah because it's either it's mayonnaise it'd be like four or

1038
02:29:09,930 --> 02:29:14,170
mayonnaise weird how it can be multiple syllables depending on how you say it very interesting

1039
02:29:14,170 --> 02:29:25,340
word like you could say jerk like jerk or like sure to try to drag it out yeah you can drag it

1040
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:30,139
out this turned into a thing but i was just trying to ask uh which spells do you think i should

1041
02:29:30,139 --> 02:29:36,059
equip definitely the heel like you know there there is a a heel that only heals you it's not

1042
02:29:36,059 --> 02:29:41,530
a group hill well there's one that heals a target unless there's no target and then it heals you

1043
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:47,610
okay yeah so that that's the one yeah yeah i got that one i got uh protection shield yep that's a

1044
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:53,190
good one like the little bubble it's like it's like power shield i've got increased damage by 10

1045
02:29:53,190 --> 02:30:00,569
hell yeah oh and hell yeah and any other special requests i think that sounds pretty good to me

1046
02:30:00,569 --> 02:30:09,030
i think there's is there one that does uh holy damage uh there is a i'm trying to see if my

1047
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:19,739
glasses it's just holy damage on that italics there's a there's holy light yeah 30 hp heal or

1048
02:30:19,739 --> 02:30:32,629
100 undead damage be liberal with the spells okay you guys ready let's go for it let's do it

1049

1050
02:30:46,299 --> 02:30:51,819
it's the jerky in my my back pocket that's what that is i was gonna say i didn't want to but it

1051
02:30:51,819 --> 02:31:00,819
sounded rude to bring it up but it's helpful in case we come across hounds like this one auto

1052
02:31:00,819 --> 02:31:09,260
right here all right let's hope we're in the same game this time and not across the whole

1053
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:16,250
world from each other that's weird you said brother we're just simply too powerful when united

1054
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:28,250
they split us up at the start somebody said jerf you look constipated uh how you doing down there

1055
02:31:28,250 --> 02:31:37,399
we are we are split up again what the f**k damn something's wrong what's all right we need to

1056
02:31:37,399 --> 02:31:42,010
breathe all right just i'm just gonna i'm just gonna just yell at people and then have them kill

1057
02:31:43,059 --> 02:31:50,489

1060
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:12,899
i'm a free kill i actually am that i know you might think that i'm saying that i have a group

1061
02:32:12,899 --> 02:32:17,459
of two other people but we can't get in the same game together for some reason so free gear on me

1062
02:32:17,459 --> 02:32:28,600
i'm dying by enemies free gear over here free gear right here you just killed two innocents

1063
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:38,969
they were so so young just kidding the rangers okay i'm dead that was fast well i just i just

1064
02:32:38,969 --> 02:32:44,809
died and i figured we'd just reload i think that's a great idea but i'm gonna cast a practice spell

1065
02:32:44,809 --> 02:32:53,049
first where are you i wonder why this is weird why is this happening yeah i don't know maybe if we

1066
02:32:53,049 --> 02:33:06,250
just all exit kind of reload let's remake the party yeah yeah you got it oh oh heck oh no wait

1067
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:18,409
i think i heard you die there was a spike sound yeah that that'd be me oh no jurf is dead good one

1068
02:33:18,409 --> 02:33:32,780
jurf classic classic jurf classic jurf peripheral vision with this helmet all right so yeah actually

1069
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:37,420
take this opportunity to practice because i can't i can't cast a spell how do you cast a spell

1070
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:43,590
right let's uh you hold right click i think right and that charges it and you cannot move when you

1071
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:53,559
cast it that's correct you healed the zombie oh no is it not a zombie is not undead well that's a

1072
02:33:53,559 --> 02:34:01,190
mummy well that's a that's a mummy are mummies not undead i believe um isn't that by definition

1073
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:13,159
i think that's correct yeah they should be dead classic classic ripple apparently i'm fine this

1074
02:34:13,159 --> 02:34:20,629
is literally bugleberry yeah it kind of is this is the haircut heels do not damage enemies

1075
02:34:20,629 --> 02:34:27,670
apparently so i was completely wrong when i said that to you but it that was the mimic that killed

1076
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:35,530
me i was running from that thing when i ran to the spike oh yeah there's a spike down there watch

1077
02:34:39,219 --> 02:34:50,120
it found you oh that's the one oh there it is all right so what that's the one that one

1078
02:34:50,600 --> 02:35:05,219
undead that one hurts undead yes okay you gotta whisper too there's a big aoe around you i think

1079
02:35:05,219 --> 02:35:12,629
make sure you loot it oh it's not dead i think it is the stick the best thing you got

1080
02:35:14,819 --> 02:35:25,989
he's not dead jerma can you please get this haircut maybe that would be kind of funny

1081
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:38,920
this haircut is seriously just okay so casting can you can anybody pull this haircut off i feel

1082
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:49,100
like it's really hard to but anyways he's casting it go ahead holy purification there you go good

1083
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:54,139
job i figured it out okay and it's like the zone's coming does a ton of damage by the way it hurts

1084
02:35:54,139 --> 02:36:02,489
a lot oh no that move is incredible zone if you if you um if you run around and grab like two or

1085
02:36:02,489 --> 02:36:06,489
three people and they're chasing you you can almost kill everything and just one huge aoe like that

1086
02:36:06,489 --> 02:36:15,260
it hurts a lot it's like 70 plus damage i think watch out the bugs are eating you my god dude

1087
02:36:15,819 --> 02:36:23,500
so bad what was that it was awful you didn't even like attack so bad oh make a lot

1095
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:30,840
for a weapon felling axe if you can get one everybody loves felling axes what do you think

1096
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:39,639
they call him that um probably the guy that invented it like tripped over it oh he wouldn't

1097
02:37:39,639 --> 02:37:50,219
they call trip axes then but it ain't that he fell all right invites going up i get it what's

1105
02:38:44,139 --> 02:38:51,319
the aoe does undead monster damage and then holy light does just undead target damage

1112
02:40:31,479 --> 02:40:42,540
i'm sorry there's a more than more than like two two bad guys maybe use a spell yeah on individual

1113
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:47,719
just single enemies not really but if we have like more than one or two then yeah like should i

1126
02:42:41,829 --> 02:42:49,030
screaming get ready to jerk your maker what does that mean i forgot how to cast a spell

1127
02:42:49,030 --> 02:43:01,530
they're running you think we should chase uh nah we gotta get through the circle anyways oh they

1128
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:11,030
left one behind they did it was a little wizard oh no oh no he turned oh it's a cleric that's even

1129
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:21,879
worse that was so where'd they go i don't know if they caught was this person alone oops oh this

1130
02:43:21,879 --> 02:43:26,729
person may have been alone but they feel a little bad if they were they were swinging at you though

1131
02:43:26,729 --> 02:43:38,700
yeah they did swing once with a stick yeah that was aggression yeah that's provocation i thought

1132
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:44,979
i was casting protection on you uh that was a self-cast you can also very protected you can

1133
02:43:44,979 --> 02:43:51,100
give it to enemies too by the way like you can heal enemies oh good so if you cast a healing spell

1134
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:58,090
and you do it to another player they will get healed there's some comedy there oh yeah that's

1135
02:43:58,090 --> 02:44:08,100
funny i did also like the part where he said it's jurfing time yeah that's your i'm about to jurf

1138
02:44:39,700 --> 02:44:46,409
good movie quote like there is death in here there's there's death in here we should all go

1139
02:44:46,409 --> 02:44:53,989
to read that line together we should all split up hey you know if we make it out here alive

1140
02:44:53,989 --> 02:45:04,620
let's go to the let's go get some hey i'll share a pint of ale with you for real yeah can i get my

1143
02:45:21,239 --> 02:45:32,219
getting into the area where we're gonna have to fight oh there's a heal already oh a falchion

1144
02:45:32,219 --> 02:45:41,290

1146
02:45:47,860 --> 02:46:00,149
you get kind of stuck in though like i'm looking at my spells and no it happens okay those are

1147
02:46:00,149 --> 02:46:09,000
invulnerable i'm concerned with being ready to give you guys like a shield jurf there is a jurf

1148
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:14,780
and a pair of giraffes in here and if you want to jurf here i would jurf this oh can we just all

1155
02:47:21,930 --> 02:47:34,920
think you have to have it instead of snaf is it better than staff it might be seems like it it has

1156
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:39,719
like plus magic damage or something it should i don't know how it works really i don't play

1157
02:47:39,719 --> 02:47:55,020
the casters uh we gotta move oh maybe this way a little closer to the zone a little peak

1158
02:47:55,579 --> 02:48:00,299
all this back the way we came jurf you sound like a really swell canadian guy

1159
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:12,020

1227
03:03:11,430 --> 03:03:22,069
jeref what's your favorite item what do you like to use um stick big old jerv stick

1228
03:03:22,709 --> 03:03:35,909
the old jerv quarterstaff stick a big old jerv stick uh what do you what do you call uh

1229
03:03:37,399 --> 03:03:46,059
uh well have you had an impossible burger yet no let's try it's impossible it's just you should

1230
03:03:46,059 --> 03:03:51,690
give it a try i feel like it'd be interesting you think jerv specifically would enjoy an

1231
03:03:51,690 --> 03:03:56,889
impossible burger actually jerv would probably take a bite of the impossible burger and then

1232
03:03:56,889 --> 03:04:04,219
kill me with his axe because i suggested it in the first place so it's not good i mean i'm

1233
03:04:04,219 --> 03:04:11,750
getting mixed signals here okay that's like a jerv bites this his eyes turn red he grabs the axe

1234
03:04:11,750 --> 03:04:18,790
and he just kills me jerv they're pretty good though you probably like it am i killing you or

1235
03:04:18,790 --> 03:04:25,899
am i liking it it depends on um i don't know it depends on how you how you are i'm bringing this

1236
03:04:25,899 --> 03:04:32,219
oh i am i don't know like i don't know what what jerv's preferences are in regards to food

1237
03:04:32,219 --> 03:04:40,540
i feel like there's a pretty large middle ground between killing you and liking it

1238
03:04:40,540 --> 03:04:55,639
it might be okay all right we good yeah um yeah i'm gonna go jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv

1256
03:07:57,780 --> 03:08:04,489
body and like just putting it in their pocket and leaving that seems okay how do we um we should

1257
03:08:04,489 --> 03:08:11,979
probably just hang out over here this one archer it's two now just be careful stay behind me get

1259
03:08:17,260 --> 03:08:21,579
will never know i think you put down your shield the second he attacked is that what happened

1260
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:27,219
i didn't want to say anything but i did anyway i'm sorry do you want me to heal you or do you have

1264
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:09,659
it is actually was it better than what i was that scary sound you guys hear that

need to find a shrine nothing here all right there's gonna be a lot of people in this area

1267
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:37,559
so just be careful should i focus on support or offense if we run into other people if we run into

1268
03:09:37,559 --> 03:09:41,770
one or two people focus on healing me because that's what they're going to be doing if it's

1421
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:43,040
killed you it's Alex I don't know if I did or not but it may have been me wait

1422
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:49,760
did because I was blocking the daggers I think they might have poked around the

1423
03:31:49,760 --> 03:31:55,200
daggers I don't know I I had like a few greens I did it's check the kill feed it

1424
03:31:55,200 --> 03:32:06,750
was me was it a good job over there it was in the kill feed sorry dude there's

1425
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:10,750
a lot going on and it's a huge arc and I think I may have hit you directly in the

1426
03:32:10,750 --> 03:32:16,610
back of like the spine you can't kill my healer only I can kill my healer but I

1427
03:32:16,610 --> 03:32:24,950
will bring you something nice because I did get some nice stuff yeah me too yeah

1428
03:32:24,950 --> 03:32:28,350
we're going back in there with the purples or you think we're gonna take

1429
03:32:28,350 --> 03:32:32,909
it easy of her own if I win with a purple I put it back in the box oh yeah

1430
03:32:32,909 --> 03:32:42,879
yeah you know I mean yeah back to graze for me well that's not necessarily true

1431
03:32:42,879 --> 03:32:50,090
oh you hear that oh I I have at least a cool shield for you I want to look at my

1432
03:32:50,090 --> 03:32:55,639
perks I have at least I have a cool shield and I've got cool boots for you

1433
03:32:55,639 --> 03:33:04,829
too you're gonna be just fine should I change from the AOE the PvE AOE to

1434
03:33:04,829 --> 03:33:14,579
different like player skill um the AOE is real the AOE heal is very good but I

1435
03:33:14,579 --> 03:33:19,579
don't know I don't really know cleric that well I can't really help you I don't

1436
03:33:19,579 --> 03:33:26,590
think the judge there's a judgment skill but it seems very specific like it looks

1437
03:33:26,590 --> 03:33:32,840
like reading the Terms of Service on the website because it says after focusing

1438
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:37,840
for point five seconds immediately deal 35 magic damage and reduce targets

1439
03:33:37,840 --> 03:33:42,440
movement speed for two seconds but can only be cast when the crosshair targets

1440
03:33:42,440 --> 03:33:48,719
an enemy within four point five meters hmm yeah that sounds like a lot there's a

1441
03:33:48,719 --> 03:34:01,709
lot hmm I got boots for you I don't know if I want to take them I'm gonna okay

1442
03:34:01,709 --> 03:34:07,049
I'm keeping at least okay this is the new plan I want to keep some good shit

1443
03:34:07,049 --> 03:34:15,040
here I'll bring you these boots because this is gonna be good for you I'll bring

1444
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:20,899
you this I have a blue pair of boots for you

1445
03:34:21,100 --> 03:34:25,020
and I have a nice shield with plus one attributes it's gonna be nice okay trying

1446
03:34:25,020 --> 03:34:32,379
to decide whether to do the PvE or PvP skill PvP is probably the way to go if

1447
03:34:32,379 --> 03:34:41,870
you're in a group of three oh you can also like not memorize spells and just

1448
03:34:41,870 --> 03:34:48,909
take two skills I guess yeah you can I think there's a weird way because it's

1449
03:34:48,909 --> 03:34:58,590
like the memory slots right mm-hmm yeah PvP is probably better not fine pants

1450
03:34:58,590 --> 03:35:04,049
not concerned about it someone said our PvP is terrible right after two of you

1451
03:35:04,049 --> 03:35:08,569
guys just made it out with purple items after killing multiple team groups I

1452
03:35:08,569 --> 03:35:13,930
mean that we we were the victor on at least three separate team fights there

1453
03:35:13,930 --> 03:35:16,329
were we not yeah I think we're doing just fine

1454
03:35:16,329 --> 03:35:30,639
everyone's voting for a derma throw oh actually you should take this ring to

1455
03:35:30,639 --> 03:35:35,479
this plus one spell capacity I'm actually gonna get because this is buff

1456
03:35:35,479 --> 03:35:41,559
durations too I don't know maybe you should take them both wait I got a I got

1457
03:35:41,559 --> 03:35:47,760
a necklace a piece for you to agility the jelly will help him a lot right I

1458
03:35:48,319 --> 03:35:55,149
know that's just moving speed now I'll keep that on for me the ring though it's

1459
03:35:55,149 --> 03:36:01,770
gonna help you with spell capacity and a little bit more strength I have an AOE

1460
03:36:01,770 --> 03:36:06,690
spell I'm feeling pretty good after that after the last one that was good yeah no

1461
03:36:06,690 --> 03:36:10,409
that was good we had that we actually did very well I'm happy with it oh there

1462
03:36:10,409 --> 03:36:18,899
is an AOE spell would you guys rather have I feel like I can't do both bless

1463
03:36:18,899 --> 03:36:23,020
and protection would you rather have 20 physical damage blocked or plus three to

1464
03:36:23,020 --> 03:36:31,149
strength agility and will for 30 seconds the idea I like the agility that

1465
03:36:31,149 --> 03:36:39,819
movement speed agility is movement speed and attack speed it's huge still I'm

1466
03:36:39,819 --> 03:36:51,170
going to give you these boots probably better for you magic pen versus item

1467
03:36:51,170 --> 03:36:54,729
equipped speed or magic pen this magic pen work for a clerk what would that do

1468
03:36:54,729 --> 03:37:10,120
um is that yes doesn't make your heels more potent casting agility on your

1469
03:37:10,120 --> 03:37:13,899
melee teammate makes them ten times better yeah I'm just gonna keep my load

03:51:57,260 --> 03:52:01,780
stash yeah that's in that's in the snatch honestly that's that's one of the best

1574
03:52:01,780 --> 03:52:05,100
items I think I've seen so far for playing it's just it's all about stats

1575
03:52:05,100 --> 03:52:09,819
especially the just having plus three to all stats it's just it does is a cracked

1576
03:52:09,819 --> 03:52:16,079
item save that for the next two days and then in the last day equip it and

1577
03:52:16,079 --> 03:52:27,239
just run into a fucking door let me just I'm gonna bring this for you get rid of

1578
03:52:27,239 --> 03:52:36,200
this other stuff molotovs are actually kind of fun I'll keep it you just sell

1579
03:52:36,200 --> 03:52:47,459
all gemstones yeah that's it's just for money what about what about you said

1580
03:52:47,459 --> 03:52:51,719
candy is important can't so go to merchants and go all the way the right

1581
03:52:51,719 --> 03:53:04,079
top right Valentine it's all purples oh oh it's a currency it's a currency and I

1582
03:53:04,120 --> 03:53:10,090
just found the weapon that I'm going to use and not use to put it in the

1583
03:53:10,090 --> 03:53:19,920
inventory holy shit it's a purple longsword I just used my candy I've been

1584
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:24,959
saving it but yeah this is really good shit there it's just like a good way to

1585
03:53:24,959 --> 03:53:29,709
get a purple over time though those little candies the little hard candies

1586
03:53:29,709 --> 03:53:35,149
they're kind of hard to find they're not like common yeah it just seems like an

1587
03:53:35,149 --> 03:53:47,030
exchange for epic okay kind of filling out here so you're gonna bring the the

1588
03:53:47,030 --> 03:53:53,489
staff yes I'll bring the core stuff for you okay I'm gonna look at my spells

1589
03:53:53,489 --> 03:54:21,409
again I do want to buy okay pants pants pants I yeah I will the eight so the AOE

1590
03:54:21,409 --> 03:54:25,489
healed that won't heal enemy players right or will it oh yeah I will it will

1591
03:54:25,489 --> 03:54:33,299
be real friendly beings but they may they're not friendly you know use the

1592
03:54:33,299 --> 03:54:37,579
purple sword no no and when I lose this I might if for it to heal them I think

1593
03:54:37,579 --> 03:54:42,809
that they should have to say I'm friendly yeah in proximity yeah that was

1594
03:54:42,809 --> 03:54:50,680
a good round though we actually that we did we played very well it's a six cost

1595
03:54:50,680 --> 03:55:06,309
is the problem ooh maybe maybe get rid of weapon damage it's hard to cast all

1596
03:55:06,309 --> 03:55:09,909
the buffs at the same time like it's priority is this thing's fucking awesome

1597
03:55:09,909 --> 03:55:21,389
too we got protection bless and divine strike did you like the bar ditch the

1598
03:55:21,430 --> 03:55:26,870
the big axe yeah did you like using the bar ditch I don't remember using it

1599
03:55:26,870 --> 03:55:29,309
really I'm not on your barbarian I'm thinking

1600
03:55:29,309 --> 03:55:33,750
jerk do you like the bar do you like barges you can't hear you right now

1601
03:55:33,750 --> 03:55:45,520
bless is the weakest I'll buy this one I want to get confirmation because I will

1602
03:55:45,520 --> 03:55:57,319
buy it and he just pay me back like he'll just drop 160 gold from me you

1603
03:55:57,319 --> 03:56:01,159
have to give up so much to get sanctuary and the other I guess you can get rid of

1604
03:56:01,159 --> 03:56:11,479
the thick heel but then that's the best one for PvP like it's too expensive it

1605
03:56:11,479 --> 03:56:20,620
is very expensive sanctuary is a six cost another raid there's another raid

1606
03:56:20,620 --> 03:56:29,120
from beta 64 also dag nail earlier to thanks welcome welcome Raiders here

03:56:41,629 --> 03:56:47,059
of it I was sitting there just watching the whole time I'm gonna go with this I

1610
03:56:47,059 --> 03:56:55,540
had like a cinematic view of that whole scenario yeah there's also a

1611
03:56:55,540 --> 03:57:04,190
resurrection spell it's true there is it is a cost Wow so that would be two

1612
03:57:04,190 --> 03:57:18,270
thirds of my spell memory with no extra gear helping no way it was a real

1613
03:57:18,270 --> 03:57:23,500
terrific moment so in another couple levels Alex you're gonna be able to get

1614
03:57:23,500 --> 03:57:28,180
a another perk yeah the second one will be nice because right now it's just

1615
03:57:28,379 --> 03:57:37,459
there's some good ones yeah I can get as drunk as I want with no detrimental

1616
03:57:37,459 --> 03:57:46,420
side effects I wonder what happens when you drink booze in this game like pain

1617
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:52,420
oh okay so that's right people do like brewmaster clerk because if I drink then

1618
03:57:52,420 --> 03:57:57,020
my screen gets all fucked up and it's hard to swing you are not affected by

1619
03:57:57,020 --> 03:58:01,100
drunkenness in the game so you could effectively just buy like a shitload of

1620
03:58:01,100 --> 03:58:05,620
booze and just be pounding it and just get only the stat bonus when you want it

1621
03:58:05,659 --> 03:58:11,510
and not the negative people do brewmaster clerk bonus is good yeah it's

1622
03:58:11,510 --> 03:58:14,750
like plus 10 strength or something or plus 15 agility it's something like

1623
03:58:14,750 --> 03:58:29,379
that it's huge people do it I think you're committing to melee cleric at

1624
03:58:29,379 --> 03:58:36,280
that point right and beer is very cheap yeah so if you wanted to put like a mace

1625
03:58:36,280 --> 03:58:41,879
on and really not really cast many spells and just drink potions get plus

1626
03:58:41,879 --> 03:58:49,940
10 strength and just go absolutely crazy you could your increases strength HP

1627
03:58:49,979 --> 03:58:57,889
damage etc our strength increases HP damage yeah yeah it's HP and image

1628
03:58:57,889 --> 03:59:19,920

2123
05:08:07,909 --> 05:08:15,110
everyone we could have killed that boss we could have killed it we killed the

2124
05:08:15,110 --> 05:08:18,470
way of escaping alive so the rate didn't have anything did it even have like a

2125
05:08:18,470 --> 05:08:24,569
green it had a green cleric chest which I'm gonna bring for you I'm just

2126
05:08:24,569 --> 05:08:42,799
whispering now I got three of these you know it's really funny I was just being

2127
05:08:42,799 --> 05:08:48,840
stuck and lost in that space is what made us able to live and leave because we

2128
05:08:48,840 --> 05:08:54,360
were like everyone else was dead I think everybody else is dead literally

2129
05:08:54,360 --> 05:08:59,450
everybody because you meant you commented on how the kill feed yeah was

2130
05:08:59,450 --> 05:09:13,259
very busy that's exactly what happened almost 400 gold on Jerv mmm nice anyone

2131
05:09:13,259 --> 05:09:22,759
want a present I do like I got you a rope I might let's go long so actually

2132
05:09:22,759 --> 05:09:31,279
you need a rope because my best one I lost when the one before this about you

2133
05:09:31,279 --> 05:09:35,720
need you want a present I'm going kind of try hard mode this time I'm putting

2134
05:09:35,720 --> 05:09:42,549
on a good sword really good pants bunch of heels I got a right I got a pretty

2135
05:09:42,549 --> 05:09:50,810
decent setup keeping the boys alive I am a loot goblin or whoever wants to kill

2136
05:09:50,810 --> 05:09:57,009
me but I think it's time to go for a try hard one let me see if there's

2137
05:09:57,009 --> 05:10:13,680
anything better I can buy no much let's see I've almost got 300 gold that's good

2138
05:10:13,680 --> 05:10:22,400
that's a good start that's pretty good almost as much as Jerv I have 750 I had

2139
05:10:22,400 --> 05:10:34,689
almost a thousand playing some support okay so there's like gear that lets you

2140
05:10:34,689 --> 05:10:44,509
memorize more spells there is because that would be pretty sweet you guys want

2141
05:10:44,549 --> 05:10:57,279
to go down to the under area the under area yeah yeah we should if we spawn

2142
05:10:57,279 --> 05:11:07,279
near it hmm see like sanctuary would have been awesome for that last

2143
05:11:07,279 --> 05:11:16,240
encounter I mean we did pretty good we managed agro on two different bosses yeah

2144
05:11:16,240 --> 05:11:19,840
it was pretty good yeah it was pretty good by the way I yes I'm doing the

2145
05:11:19,840 --> 05:11:42,520
swords by height so relax I'm bringing a drink for you just because I it's been

2146
05:11:42,520 --> 05:11:56,450
in my inventory for like a week all right how is everybody doing sure it's

2147
05:11:56,450 --> 05:12:04,860
good yeah why not buy money bags um I could but I don't I mean there's no

2148
05:12:04,860 --> 05:12:09,639
reason to have them right now until I get more gear I'd rather just keep the

2149
05:12:09,639 --> 05:12:13,560
money it's five bucks per bag right why would I spend five bucks when I don't

2150
05:12:13,560 --> 05:12:22,299
even look at I got all this empty space it looks nicer I like the gold coins I

2151
05:12:22,299 --> 05:12:32,270
think looks cool all right we good to go uh everybody ready it oh ripple you have

2152
05:12:32,270 --> 05:12:38,270
another perk to put on oh yeah level 5 you get another perk uh I actually put

2153
05:12:38,270 --> 05:12:42,669
one on yeah oh yeah damage reduction in a small after that encounter where I

2154
05:12:42,669 --> 05:12:48,180
died I put the like five percent bonus damage I don't know if that's enough but

2155
05:12:48,180 --> 05:13:04,400
you're pretty good to win the next fight okay let me just let's go for it how

2156
05:13:04,400 --> 05:13:12,330
many charges of sanctuary do you get I I don't know is it more than one in my

2157
05:13:12,330 --> 05:13:16,799
because it's a really really amazing heal to just a gigantic AOE heal you get

2158
05:13:16,799 --> 05:13:25,509
to probably get rid of the light heal hmm but I've been enjoying running what

2159
05:13:25,509 --> 05:13:30,729
I've got so far it's been working we're staying alive we are staying alive and

2160
05:13:30,729 --> 05:13:35,569
I've got really good gear on so I'm going to try this round I'm not gonna do

2161
05:13:35,569 --> 05:13:48,299
anything dumb like a like a tuna can a tuna can yeah like a tuna tin can mm-hmm

2245
05:26:33,569 --> 05:26:38,849
to figure out like my screen was especially dark I know it's called dark

2246
05:26:38,849 --> 05:26:42,650
and darker but it was more so than usual yeah I mean it is called dark and

2247
05:26:42,650 --> 05:26:47,209
darker but I went into the options and it did a turn screen brightness up and

2248
05:26:47,209 --> 05:26:51,529
brighter I see I put I literally put it up all the way and no one's seen that

2249
05:26:51,529 --> 05:26:54,889
yet but you know what I don't even care if you see it bright and brighter kind

2250
05:26:54,889 --> 05:27:04,130
of yeah ah that's good to know yeah it's in the game it's not met it's not

2251
05:27:04,130 --> 05:27:08,180
fucking with anything it's in the game the developers have put it in there so I

2252
05:27:08,180 --> 05:27:15,060
put it up all the way I see yep so unless they take that out in the game

2253
05:27:15,060 --> 05:27:31,340
people saying omega low high settings high settings yeah because I mean on

2254

2257
05:28:01,810 --> 05:28:08,860
just armor is good like you can never go wrong with I mean I take a weapon I

2258
05:28:08,860 --> 05:28:15,009
guess armor say any anything's good because I am actually out of everything

2259
05:28:15,009 --> 05:28:27,020
except one blue plate of boots I do have money though I have like 300 gold this

2260
05:28:27,020 --> 05:28:32,939

05:31:40,220 --> 05:31:43,900
you want to go that's the way they'll go it's just like following behind you guys

2283
05:31:43,900 --> 05:31:49,970
picking up the scraps that you don't want in an equipping them hey far I've

2284

spot the last time you guys jumped down there things went really bad it did we

2311
05:35:44,159 --> 05:35:50,360
should probably not do that although this oh yeah this is that horrible room

2312
05:35:50,360 --> 05:35:53,880
we're here pretty early though so we might actually be okay

05:35:54,159 --> 05:36:04,259
expert be birdie oh my god and I forgot that it was even there yeah I guess

2314

2561
06:06:48,759 --> 06:06:53,380
joining Will Neff and I think somebody else I'm not sure who it is should be

2562
06:06:53,380 --> 06:07:03,770
fun I'm just chilling until then I have to do some inventory management mmm I

2563
06:07:03,770 --> 06:07:10,500

2567
06:08:26,060 --> 06:08:33,430
has one yeah yeah no no that's all good there are a lot of people playing this

2568
06:08:33,430 --> 06:08:35,310
right now a lot of people kind of jumping around a lot of people getting

2569
06:08:35,310 --> 06:08:39,759
groups part of the reason too that I had the three groups kind of blocked out

2570
06:08:39,759 --> 06:08:46,189
is to try to jump around so I'm not looking I've got a group so I'm not

2571
06:08:46,189 --> 06:09:00,869
like really looking for one I think this is clean offline okay I was like who is

2572
06:09:00,869 --> 06:09:08,659
this in the lobby right now sure I'm gonna exit I'm kind of scared that if I

2573
06:09:08,659 --> 06:09:19,740
don't then the same problem is gonna happen it's gonna restart the game

2574
06:09:19,740 --> 06:09:33,770
does anyone know how this runs on DX 11 because there's an option to start it

2575
06:09:33,770 --> 06:09:44,419
with dips DX 11 I imagine it's probably not very good you know it's so weird

2576
06:09:44,459 --> 06:09:50,369
about all the new graphics all the new DirectX versions it feels like

2577
06:09:50,369 --> 06:10:00,360
everything after DX 10 just kind of sucks is that weird to say like

2578
06:10:00,360 --> 06:10:05,950
everything I feel like it's all kind of broken after like 10 or 11 like it's

2579
06:10:05,950 --> 06:10:09,990
like oh yeah you could you could run it on like DX 12 but or DX 11 but don't do

2580
06:10:09,990 --> 06:10:22,659
that oh here we go I'm getting in fly like an eagle that was beautiful to come

2613
06:13:59,220 --> 06:14:04,709

2614
06:14:04,709 --> 06:14:10,119
lose charges I did not really yep if you're if you're a mage you will lose

2615
06:14:10,119 --> 06:14:16,349
charges if you cast spells randomly up in the clubbing kind of sucks all right I

2616
06:14:16,349 --> 06:14:23,139

2668
06:20:30,159 --> 06:20:35,889
action that's okay there is a person in the lobby named fart smeller who's

2669
06:20:35,889 --> 06:20:41,090
killing everybody yeah we have to be very aware of fart smeller he's a rogue

2670
06:20:41,130 --> 06:20:47,709
you'll classic fart smeller watch out for fart smeller fart smell like fart

2671
06:20:47,709 --> 06:20:50,869
smell it just so load fart smell it just so load a whole group I think you're

2672
06:20:50,869 --> 06:20:57,330
right do you like my bacon potato combo how'd you get that oh somebody can leave

2673
06:20:57,330 --> 06:21:05,240
it's true what does the campfire do it heals and resets charges of spells I

2674
06:21:05,240 --> 06:21:08,639
should probably leave to make sure I get out because I want to and we're getting

2675
06:21:08,639 --> 06:21:15,799
shot at so go ahead and get out of here I have his entire loadout so yes thank

2676
06:21:15,799 --> 06:21:22,720
God cuz I wasn't ready for those traps oh my god is that fart smeller yeah

2677
06:21:22,720 --> 06:21:32,970
that's that's someone that's a three stack yep I feel about this I believe in

2678
06:21:32,970 --> 06:21:38,150
well but I don't know if I believe in a 1v3 that's a tight that's it that's a

2679
06:21:38,150 --> 06:21:53,310
tough tight scenario yeah I do believe in you will leave but I wonder they

2680
06:21:53,349 --> 06:22:01,819
might be fighting that might be two different teams it doesn't tell me how

2681
06:22:01,819 --> 06:22:09,659
you how many are left right I think where the timer is counting down I think

2682
06:22:09,659 --> 06:22:14,340
that's the amount of people that are still here the gray right the gray

2683
06:22:14,340 --> 06:22:19,779
notches oh I don't know no the gray notches are how much time is left oh I've

2684
06:22:19,779 --> 06:22:25,779
been reading that completely wrong for a whole fucking week it's like the entire

2685
06:22:25,779 --> 06:22:30,340
lobby is alive this circle is so small I can't believe I got that right actually

2686
06:22:30,340 --> 06:22:34,650
a whole week thought it was notches for people I have a feeling they're gonna

2687
06:22:34,650 --> 06:22:50,909
come out right here I'm gonna go Batman books I'm gonna give them the old where's

2688
06:22:50,909 --> 06:23:04,080
Rachel I think they moved in you think they dipped they might be dead I mean I

2689
06:23:04,080 --> 06:23:12,299
don't hear anybody I think they were just kind of murdering their way through

2690
06:23:12,299 --> 06:23:23,610
well I need healing stuff anyway yeah where did they go oh man has a potion

2691
06:23:23,610 --> 06:23:36,400

2692
06:23:36,400 --> 06:23:41,599
lights over here fuck this I'm gonna go around you have a torch dude I don't I

2693
06:23:41,599 --> 06:23:47,159
don't want that smoke well I have an idea that's a fart smeller super setup

2694
06:23:47,159 --> 06:23:50,159
right there I feel like you and I could probably execute this pretty well well

2695
06:23:50,159 --> 06:23:55,279
what's that I want to fill my inventory with gold yeah and I want to run around

2696
06:23:55,279 --> 06:23:59,200
and just be dropping it when people hit me and just be a loot goblin for people

2697

the bosses for those are they just are they just ridiculous I'm not gonna lie

2725
06:27:14,029 --> 06:27:20,069
the bosses are absurdly difficult and you they're like different raid phases

2726
06:27:20,069 --> 06:27:28,479
yeah thank you yeah I saw you do the ghost one they kind of bugged out he

2728
06:27:32,759 --> 06:27:36,919
shot where he like flies up and if you if you don't jump at the right time you

2729
06:27:36,919 --> 06:27:47,909
just die that sounds like hell right the other boss also has a one shot that's

2730
06:27:47,950 --> 06:27:54,549
like really weird it's like this very slow traveling orb there's one that

2731
06:27:54,549 --> 06:28:03,790

2735
06:28:47,240 --> 06:28:52,659
school D&D stuff they're adding more classes to I think right yeah they're

2741
06:29:36,220 --> 06:29:39,299
through the choke they hit each other they're terrible

2742
06:29:39,299 --> 06:29:47,869
drop one drop two let's go all right what do they got what do they got what

2745
06:30:02,119 --> 06:30:07,759

2746
06:30:07,759 --> 06:30:15,790
to hit you I got I mean it's yeah it's better we got about 10 seconds till the

2747
06:30:15,790 --> 06:30:23,639
fires up yeah did you have anything else pop off and come on all right let's go

2748
06:30:23,639 --> 06:30:34,180
camaraderie oh my I'm I didn't even know you had this nice double-heel yeah I

2749
06:30:34,220 --> 06:30:38,500
mean like when you're past half health it's it's good just a fireplace because

2750
06:30:38,500 --> 06:30:42,459
you otherwise you burn so many consumables trying to get back to full

2751
06:30:42,459 --> 06:30:52,700
health efficiency indeed indeed this game is cool this game is so fun it's way

2752
06:30:52,700 --> 06:31:01,610
funner with people I played solo the first night I played it and I think I

2753
06:31:01,610 --> 06:31:06,689
lost 95 I played probably 20 to 30 games and I lost every single one I won like

2754
06:31:06,689 --> 06:31:11,799
maybe two out of like the 30 I bled all right this has been looted but they

2755
06:31:11,799 --> 06:31:16,479
didn't kill this area for some reason so be really careful because if they get up

2756
06:31:16,479 --> 06:31:22,639
top it's really hard to win a fight in here all right we got the mage oh red

2757
06:31:22,639 --> 06:31:30,889
skeleton you play rogue or something it's a little easier I don't like this

2758

3060
07:06:31,119 --> 07:06:34,500
catalyst to that going so wrong completely wrong yeah when clobber it

3061
07:06:34,500 --> 07:06:43,209
died that was just a bad omen I think I believe he found us across the yeah map

3062
07:06:43,250 --> 07:06:49,509
is huge isn't it yeah I saw clobber peek the door there and then he got clobbered

3063
07:06:49,509 --> 07:06:55,740
by the fucking skeleton and it was like a one-shot it was he didn't even get a

3064
07:06:55,740 --> 07:07:02,090
chance that was definitely worst gamer moment of two twenty twenty three world

3065
07:07:02,090 --> 07:07:07,479
record for cringe sorry I'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records

3066
07:07:07,479 --> 07:07:21,069
cringiest thing ever hey you know what we go again it's fine take this bow this

3067
07:07:21,069 --> 07:07:26,119

3068
07:07:26,119 --> 07:07:41,680
right he's angry very good remote nice oh that's a super bandage oh one of you

3069
07:07:41,680 --> 07:07:44,740

blue bandage 25 health okay I also have healing mice I have a ability heals me

3071
07:07:49,919 --> 07:07:59,580
too though oh yeah you should be the one staying alive though for sure I'll make

3072
07:07:59,779 --> 07:08:13,139
any barrels in this room because it just spawns more skeletons yeah honestly

3073
07:08:13,139 --> 07:08:15,819
will if you had been in that area I would have killed you both at the same

3074
07:08:15,819 --> 07:08:21,380
time well that would have been just oh I don't even know what I would have done

3075
07:08:21,380 --> 07:08:26,299
you know what I would rather die to you German than anyone else no well thank

3076
07:08:26,299 --> 07:08:36,189
you anybody cast or no so I see these shrine of protections you never get them

3077
07:08:36,189 --> 07:08:40,439
is it just not worth it or what they don't last long it kind of takes a long

3078
07:08:40,479 --> 07:08:43,799
time to activate yeah and they only last like 30 seconds or something oh really

3079
07:08:43,799 --> 07:08:56,310
that's trash listen we're going with not much loot but I think we're gonna get

3080
07:08:56,310 --> 07:09:07,040
big loot I mean anything we pick up is good another shrine to their spawning

3081

all over the place Zombo yeah just only give me a long sword because there's

3082
07:09:18,270 --> 07:09:23,580
only one point where I can hit somebody not a hundred and eighty degrees in front
