74
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,649
and I just really can't have a kiss

75
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,610
it's back to patrol us I've had a kiss

76
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,930

78
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,449

82
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,399
trial number three looks straightforward

83
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,399
my guess is you need to make things a

84
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,759
bit more balanced big big man making the

85
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
scorpion smaller won't help making him

86
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,439
larger might though that's make the

87
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,889
scorpion big I don't want a big big-ass

88
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,649
scorpion done it wait it's still

89
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,569
growing looks like this trial was a

90
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:15,560
trap hey hey hey I'm in a kiss ready for

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,879

94
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,259
