1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,429
I am back.

2
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,879
So this is a fast-paced moving shooter.

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,750
This is not a controller game, right?

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,020
What about viewfinder?

5
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,329
Yeah, that's true.

6
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:42,810
Yeah, that's true.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,219
I already got it open though.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a Guggerda game.

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,530
I, I like Guggerda games.

10
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,479
All right, let me make sure this is good to go.

11
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:04,849
Should be.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Capture this.

13
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,719
I need to capture a game.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
I would like to capture a game.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,799
That'd be great.

16
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,120
How high should my sensitivity be?

17
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,790
Dude.

18
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:42,409
All right.

19
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:42,909
It looks good.

20
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,510
Let's go.

21
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:47,790
Is there a cutscene?

22
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,090
Probably.

23
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,359
Did I just skip the cutscene?

24
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,480
I didn't mean to.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Should have known it was going to end this way.

26
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,459
Did I skip the cutscene?

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,260
God's sick sense of humor or something.

28
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,379
People like me don't get second chances.

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,530
If I did, I swear.

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,330
I can't believe there are 10 Winnie the Pooh movies.

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,530
I'm so mad about that because I've never won the million in that game.

32
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,199
I'm just never going to be allowed to.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm just never going to be allowed to get it.

34
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,280
I shook my head the whole time I was peeing.

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,379
There's no way.

36
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,469
I swear I was just in the middle of something.

37
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,789
Remember a thing though.

38
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,389
Where the heck am I?

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,789
Do I know these people?

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,550
That's what's going to happen in about five seconds.

41
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:57,530
Neons rejoice for you've arrived in glorious heaven.

42
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:57,930
What?

43
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,030
We are the believers agents of God.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,199
Okay, can one of the mods change the title?

45
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,090
Because that does not make sense for neon white.

46
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:16,590
And you dead mortals are what we refer to as neons sinners.

47
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,289
The goddess judged most unfavorably.

48
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:19,789
Okay.

49
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,289
Wait, am I meant to be in hell?

50
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,949
But fret not for we have granted you an opportunity for salvation in

51
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,449
our annual competition.

52
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:39,469
The 10 days keep it during these 10 days you neons will use your

53
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,370
villainous talents to annihilate the demons invading our Holy Land.

54
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,719
Okay, I think I can handle that.

55
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,319
This is for real.

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,780
Hey, guess what?

57
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,780
You died and God thinks you suck.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,280
Go kill some crap.

59
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:56,930
That's me.

60
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,330
That's me.

61
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,659
You will each receive a soul card containing a weapon.

62
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,460
I'm that character.

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,259
I'm that character.

64
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,360
Tana soul card.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,899
Soul card with a melee slash attack.

66
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,300
It cannot be discarded.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,699
Attach note reads according to our records fights.

68
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,699
Ideal weapon is a totally sick Samurai sword.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,100
The most competent Demon Slayer will receive the ultimate reward.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,899
That's me.

71
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,300
That's me.

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,699
I'm very own place in what the fuck?

73
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,699
No, I want to be that character.

74
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:37,699
That's not like you at all.

75
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,800
You don't you don't act like that guy did.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,100
That's me.

77
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,100
You can be the other one.

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,899
You can be like this like boss character or something.

79
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:49,290
But first some housekeeping.

80
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:03,850
That's me.

81
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:19,050
Aeon white do not forget you are here in heaven as guests.

82
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,550
These masks don't mean an explosive that we won't hesitate to

83
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,550
detonate if you step out of line.

84
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,560
And I guess I'm going to please refrain from removing them.

85
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,060
Unless of course you'd prefer to go out in flames.

86
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeesh.

87
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,879
I guess lowly sinner shouldn't expect red carpet treatment.

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,389
But heaven kind of seems like a racket and yet forgiveness

89
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,389
strangely compelling to me like every inch of my body is calling

90
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,089
out for it.

91
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,089
It's almost painful voice act along.

92
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,389
That's that's what we're doing.

93
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,990
Who exactly did I used to be?

94
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,660
Now then go forth catch your boat at the glassport and kill

95
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,060
every demon you find will be counting.

96
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,329
All right, demons soul cards.

97
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,930
No sweat memories might be hazy, but I don't need a tutorial

98
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,930
on how to kick ass.

99
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,430
They are going to do a tutorial, right?

100
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,430
Love tutorials.

101
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,779
Okay, movement.

102
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:37,879
Sure.

103
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:50,930
W S A D it's W A S D use me way way way too hard.

104
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,430
Way too much.

105
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,319
I'm going to go with 30 and then how's the FOV should I be

106
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,720
a hundred or too much is 95.

107
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,050
All right, find out a little too low.

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,269
Looks really cool.

109
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
They like point 40.

110
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,959
Okay, what am I looking at here?

111
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:22,829
Is there a double jump?

112
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:23,930
There's a glide.

113
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,529
Oh, this is very pretty.

114
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,350
I have ammo for this.

115
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,670
Oh, now what?

116
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:50,490
Oh, you can walk in this jumping to your bunny hopping.

117
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,290
Is it be hopping?

118
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:03,300
Not really music's too loud.

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,220
I got you.

120
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:06,589
I got you.

121
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,560
That's all right.

122
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,420
I think that's a little bit better.

123
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,600
You did it.

124
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,480
You got a bronze medal bronze medal unlock insight level

125
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,679
one unlock for this level gifts findable.

126
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,929
Okay, press restart.

127
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,529
Wait, you can just quick restart.

128
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay, that's a quick restart.

129
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,940
There are seven demons.

130
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Terrify card fires like a machine gun.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,220
Swap cards with Q.

132
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,419
I think I want to change that to a different button, but start

133
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,019
like this.

134
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,080
There's sprint or anything or am I just always sprinting?

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,529
Oh, what's next?

136
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,750
I level to nice TF to aim.

137
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,419
I was at an insult.

138
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,740
Okay, I get it.

139
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,309
That's pretty fast.

140
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:05,980
I'll take it.

141
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Your voice is annoying.

142
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,220
You should mute your mic must have been a real hardcore.

143
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,039
It's me yellow.

144
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,039
You're annoying.

145
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,740
How's that sound?

146
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,440
It has been a minute.

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,720
Neon yellow.

148
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,289
This guy even with a mask on I recognize him from earlier.

149
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,289
Tell I know him just vaguely.

150
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,889
That's me.

151
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,889
Holy crap.

152
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,690
You got the freaking anime sword.

153
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,990
I thought for sure you'd get one of those little guns like

154
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,889
the oh should have to turn the page.

155
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:53,389
Sorry.

156
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,990
Everyone's waiting.

157
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,490
What's it called like gnomes use?

158
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,360
Gnomes.

159
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,809
I know you're a badass.

160
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,820
Hell doesn't idiot like this seem to remember me perfectly.

161
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,519
I'm not gonna skip all the dialogue.

162
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,820
But no, we need I'm gonna know what's going on.

163
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,620
Okay, man.

164
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,419
No, for real.

165
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,519
We rolled together for years, bro.

166
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,519
Got off to some crazy stuff.

167
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,320
You're my sass game, man.

168
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,720
The darkness to my light.

169
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,220
You know, I saved your life once took a bullet for you, dude.

170
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,419
Really?

171
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,320
Nah, I'm just messing.

172
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,940
I'm not skipping.

173
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,139
I'm not skipping anything.

174
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,039
Yeah.

175
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,139
All right.

176
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,029
Seriously, dude, we should team up just like old times.

177
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,129
Then I can save you for real from those like demon freaks

178
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:55,730
or something.

179
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,730
Yeah.

180
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,129
Appreciate the offer.

181
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,230
But no, thanks.

182
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:01,429
I work alone.

183
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,830
Don't shush shush.

184
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,029
Don't shush me.

185
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,830
Don't tweet at me.

186
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,629
Don't shush me.

187
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,629
Like my favorite line from a from a TV show.

188
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,730
It could be one of my favorite lines.

189
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,710
Don't shush me.

190
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,509
Don't tweet me.

191
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,970
Just there's so much going on in that sentence.

192
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,570
I love it.

193
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,490
Sure.

194
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,629
Good meeting you.

195
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,139
Let's go.

196
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,779
This is a pistol.

197
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,220
This card ability triggers a second jump right midair.

198
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,980
How do I discard a card?

199
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,620
Oh, can I have another one of those?

200
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,759
Do I only have to have one bullet for it to work?

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,399
Oh, I see.

202
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,399
Okay, you have to collect them.

203
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,100
Whoa, that's okay.

204
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,000
I get it now.

205
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,409
Cool.

206
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,240
Cleared it.

207
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,639
Oh shit.

208
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,940
He's playing a real game.

209
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:32,820
It's a good.

210
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,320
It's it.

211
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,620
Yeah.

212
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:41,289
Yes.

213
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,580
Is this as fast as I can go?

214
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,679
I'm assuming.

215
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,080
Yes.

216
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,870
Didn't even break a sweat.

217
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,190
No, I can go even faster than that.

218
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,590
Technically.

219
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
No, not even close.

220
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,580
Rank up.

221
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,009
I ironically like this game.

222
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,110
I mean the game seems fun.

223
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,379
Jump on a balloon demon to kill it and bounce into the air.

224
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,659
And with a double jump, that would be pretty cool.

225
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,159
Oh, I blew it.

226
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:55,629
Here we go.

227
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:07,960
I got to save this.

228
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,809
Oh, there's still a demon left.

229
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,710
Oh shit.

230
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,009
Okay.

231
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:28,409
Hold on.

232
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,120
I need to I don't like you being the button to press.

233
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:53,100
I want to be like mouse for like a little too.

234
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,299
All right.

235
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:53,799
All right.

236
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:54,500
This game is fun.

237
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,399
Oh, just one more try.

238
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,399
Just one more try.

239
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,600
It really hits you with that one more try.

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,700
There we go.

241
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,409
Yeah, gold medal.

242
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,210
Gold medal.

243
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:31,710
Yeah.

244
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:32,210
Yeah.

245
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:32,610
Yeah.

246
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Gift collectible.

247
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,090
This is just the tutorial.

248
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,240
Okay, is that the alt girl I saw from earlier?

249
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,100
Hey, mind letting go of my shirt.

250
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,940
There was this huge demon chasing after me.

251
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:02,409
Where?

252
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,710
Where is it?

253
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,710
Looks like I lost it.

254
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,710
It was wrong music.

255
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,609
You'd protect me if it came back though, right?

256
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,240
No, sorry.

257
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
I got a boat to catch.

258
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,039
You're on your own kid.

259
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,589
You know how I feel about being called kid white.

260
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,490
I actually don't remember amnesia side effect of dying.

261
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,289
It seems to voice Andy.

262
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,490
Seriously, really good.

263
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,089
Aren't they?

264
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,289
I got this one.

265
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,990
I've got this one on lockdown.

266
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,589
You know what I mean?

267
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,950
I'll find me somebody that could do this better than me.

268
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,339
You won't be able to find it.

269
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,039
You're not.

270
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,940
I don't think so.

271
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,940
I've lost some memories too.

272
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,259
Like I can't even remember how to use a gun which makes this

273
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,960
whole situation extra scary.

274
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:01,940
You will bury.

275
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,039
No, no, no.

276
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,740
Bugleberry is more like this.

277
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,970
You'd like to know where the bugleberry voice comes from.

278
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,569
It's very easy to tell you although maybe it should be sort

279
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:16,369
of a mystery and tell you everything.

280
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,880
Yes.

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,680
Yes, the inspiration for bugleberry's voice is none other

282
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,480
than our favorite cartoon character Captain Crunch.

283
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,759
My cabin crunch cereal.

284
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,569
A little bit of inspiration there.

285
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:55,160
I think there's a lower bomb right there.

286
00:18:59,470 --> 00:18:59,970
It's a few.

287
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,369
It's a few different people.

288
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:07,170
It's a few different people but bugleberry is like 33%

289
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,869
Captain Crunch.

290
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,279
I don't know.

291
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,079
I should probably get going.

292
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,000
You wouldn't really abandon a cute girl like me, would you?

293
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,640
I know you don't remember but you were once a great teacher.

294
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,400
Mr.

295
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,099
White I I was well, okay.

296
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,000
Fine.

297
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,599
I can spare a second.

298
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:46,220
I guess you want to bend your knees a bit arms extended not

299
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,720
locked.

300
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,920
Is this good?

301
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,180
Yeah, but keep it steady.

302
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,480
You should use both hands and fill any open spaces on the

303
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
grip with your fingers.

304
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,349
There's something kind of exhilarating about this, huh?

305
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:08,750
Mr.

306
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,250
White.

307
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,049
I'm just looking through the chat and just seeing just the

308
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,049
people the people that are not they're not even participating

309
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:16,549
in the chat.

310
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,650
Cold hard metal in my hands that hint of danger.

311
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,150
Like you made you probably the game is probably muted.

312
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,650
You probably have no video on you just talking about what

313
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,650
you had for dinner today.

314
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,539
Anyway, like this.

315
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,049
Holy crap.

316
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,140
Are you sure you forgot?

317
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,049
I was so much fun.

318
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,049
Thanks white.

319
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,710
I owe you big.

320
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:57,710
Well, you know, it's like you said I'm a great teacher.

321
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,809
Just did the thing with space.

322
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,309
It's violet.

323
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,109
Don't go forgetting this time.

324
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,210
Neon violet.

325
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,269
Violet, huh?

326
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,640
Here girl shoot.

327
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,069
All right, it's time.

328
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,680
Let's uh-huh.

329
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,279
Purify bombs destroy red breakable walls.

330
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,450
So did I do that right?

331
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,150
This work.

332
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,630
Oh great groups of enemies.

333
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,180
It takes about a second.

334
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:50,619
Not bad.

335
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Am I grandma keeps that?

336
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,059
No, I think we I think we've answered enough my grandmother

337
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,359
asked this question questions for it to last us a few years.

338
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:18,500
I think stand near the so you can like rocket jump to give

339
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,099
you forward momentum to I'm imagining.

340
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:20,500
Yes.

341
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:44,890
Yeah, Captain Crunch sounds nothing like bugleberry.

342
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,789
Well, that's why I said it was inspiration.

343
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:50,789
It wasn't necessarily a one-to-one impression.

344
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:16,920
Is there a boss at the end of this again?

345
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,880
I didn't mean it didn't want to do that.

346
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,950
I must have missed it.

347
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,690
Yeah.

348
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:04,019
Yeah, I'm just getting started.

349
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,920
The bronze medal.

350
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,029
Nineteen demons.

351
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:24,359
Okay.

352
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,059
Well, I'm fine.

353
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:32,769
What the hell?

354
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:33,970
Oh, it's health.

355
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:24,130
That's how we use the environment bronze bronze is the best no

356
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,029
expectations.

357
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,759
You're not in you're not in second place because in second place

358
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,660
you would feel like damn.

359
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,160
I wish it was first place easy.

360
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:36,130
You just get awarded for being cool, but there's no pressure

361
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,829
of second place.

362
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:38,630
You wish you were first is no pressure first place.

363
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,970
Give me bronze all day behind you.

364
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:51,720
I do that again.

365
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,119
Somebody and the channel.

366
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,690
I don't know if mods can do that or not, but demons zero red

367
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:05,509
a hundred and the channel if it happens again long time no

368
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:15,460
see white neon red nice heard from before this girl is you

369
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,200
staring quick say something cool white that is massive

370
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,140
rifle want to taste that's okay.

371
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,440
Seriously, please don't point that thing at me.

372
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,940
Would you realize that this is the least effective way for

373
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,740
you to get me here because barrels very long and the target

374
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,839
here is now very small.

375
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,940
So now if I go I dodge my shoulder grab the barrel push

376
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,680
it over then we're this is this is a problem for you now relax.

377
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,380
I just like to see you sweat.

378
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:55,789
Okay, John.

379
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,589
In that case you should watch me wipe the floor with demons

380
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,289
sometime.

381
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,970
Yeah, I've seen a lifetime of that kind of thing.

382
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,559
You know, this is actually the first time I've seen you here

383
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:11,960
in the competition.

384
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,559
I mean makes me wonder do you think this will end for us the

385
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,559
way it did in life?

386
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,859
See, I'd love to answer that but I woke up with no memories

387
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:22,460
of life.

388
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,759
Not that I don't recognize you.

389
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,240
It's just the details are fuzzy so far though.

390
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,539
I feel the strongest connection to you.

391
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
Damn it white.

392
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,720
Why would you say something so lame to a girl how bizarre?

393
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,319
I've never heard of a neon with such an affliction.

394
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,680
Messing with me.

395
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,289
Are you I have no reason to lie to you.

396
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,609
Is that so?

397
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,930
Can't believe God himself decided to bless me with the

398
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,230
thing.

399
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,329
I love most a completely clueless boy.

400
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,630
This isn't fun for me, you know.

401
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,630
Well, it is for me.

402
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,529
We could have been lovers in life and you'd be none the

403
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,059
wiser lovers.

404
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,099
I could know every last one of your measurements.

405
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:24,599
Be serious here.

406
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,599
You've got a long boat right ahead.

407
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,599
Maybe you could fill me in on the details of my character

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,069
or even your relationship to me.

409
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:38,230
I don't know why honestly, it's probably easier this way

410
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:39,829
for both of us.

411
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
What are you going?

412
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,339
All aboard the ship.

413
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,740
I thought that was us for a second.

414
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,039
Strugglers will be returned to oblivion.

415
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,059
Yes, don't think I made it this far last time.

416
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,259
This really is my first roadie.

417
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,059
What happens if I press half bad?

418
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,000
Looks like that's what happens.

419
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,349
Bad for a dead guy, huh?

420
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,650
I feel like we missed something really important.

421
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,660
I thought it was going to be fast-forward and it was going to be

422
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,859
like, I thought it was going to be funny, but exactly what I

423
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:29,660
expected.

424
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:37,000
Why am I so disappointed?

425
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,259
Want to walk to the Believer's Sermon together?

426
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,259
I want to fight, I want to fight demons.

427
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,259
Yo, bro, you made it.

428
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,799
Kick a lot of demon ass.

429
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,799
Yes.

430
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,700
Like it was nothing.

431
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,099
I'm telling you bro, with our like combined powers, those

432
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,400
demons are donezo.

433
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,099
Wait, do we play together?

434
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,299
Do we switch characters?

435
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh snap, Violet, is that you?

436
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,700
This is crazy.

437
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,779
It's like the gang's all here.

438
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,779
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,279
Do I know you?

440
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,480
Are we all mutuals here?

441
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,480
Yeah, man.

442
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,779
Violet was our crew's littlest badass.

443
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,480
Like this one time I read her diary and she had written this

444
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,579
crazy fanfic about her and the bot.

445
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:27,670
What happened to this guy?

446
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,490
Oh, that was the I'm done.

447
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,890
Okay.

448
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,390
Let me tell you something here.

449
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,890
So that was the I'm done talking.

450
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,490
My dialogue cuts off here.

451
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,690
There is a hyphen.

452
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,789
Somebody needs to interrupt me.

453
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,990
What happens a lot of the time is the person will say the

454
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,490
line with the hyphen there and they'll stop.

455
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,089
So to be like, oh you and me.

456
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,890
Oh yeah, and you get cut off now.

457
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,890
So how you do that and you make that work a little better

458
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,589
is you just hold the hold it at the end.

459
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,390
Are you hold that last line?

460
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:06,990
Like we were supposed to be going to the grocery.

461
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,390
Oh, then I'll give me that opportunity to cut me off.

462
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,519
No one cares.

463
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,019
This is an acting class out of where the where the hell did

464
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:16,720
you think you were?

465
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,700
This is like a live streamer.

466
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,400
I play video games.

467
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,599
No, I'm teaching you acting skills.

468
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,119
I don't know what you think this is.

469
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,680
They may be freaks, but

470
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,380
all right, cool.

471
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,490

477
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,690
year.

478
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,430
It's onerous work, but the possibility of redemption is

479
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,930
well worth the effort.

480
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,829
Is it not and on that note we'd like to introduce last

481
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:19,329
year's winner of the 10 defending his crown is the vicious

482
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:19,930
Hulk.

Why do I feel so angry greens demons slaying prowess has

490

549
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
So I have to do I have to go way faster.

550
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:14,530
This is a speedrunning game.

551
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,639
You're going so slow.

552
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:23,309
Am I I was 27.

553
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:24,510
That's a gold medal.

554
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,210
He's got it.

555
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,409
93, right?

556
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,239
Doing fine.

557
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,699
I was just going around.

558
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,699
I what did I get on this one?

559
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:37,599
Okay bronze.

560
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,699
I need to do this in 13 seconds.

561
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,070
Great startup.

562
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,519
See if I can make that gap.

563
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:04,510
That's a that's a platinum.

564
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,710
See anyone beat that?

565
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,519
All right.

566
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:11,920
I get it.

567
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,329
Pretty sure I just got to 93.

568
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,780
This was silver, but I can do it in 19, right?

569
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,280
Let's do it.

570
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:38,809
I forgot.

571
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:39,909
I have to actually kill the stuff.

572
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,849
That was fucking messy.

573
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:18,659
I hold on there.

574
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:19,559
Another one down.

575
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,679
It's pretty cool.

576
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:23,980
It is.

577
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,579
Yeah, this is fun.

578
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:27,860
I'm enjoying it.

579
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:29,269
Okay.

580
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:43,130
Next mission time and days until judgment.

581
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,829
Let's go get new assignment.

582
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,300
Well, look at that.

583
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,599
Your neon rank is sufficient to move on to a new assignment.

584
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,099
Sounds are very really good.

585
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,099
Yeah, they're heavenly delight ticket.

586
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:02,760
How fun ticket granted to top-performing neon is good for one heavenly delight.

587
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,460
Is it the heavenly delight kiosk in the cathedral to redeem an experience beyond

588
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,260
your wildest dream?

589
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,059
One moment while I check on mr.

590
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,260
Mikey schedule.

591
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,429
Have a seat in about four hours for hours.

592
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:22,929
Why no, there's got to be somebody I can speak with soon.

593
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,230
I'll look into that for you.

594
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,630
And when will that be about four out?

595
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,329
All right.

596
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:28,730
This is ridiculous.

597
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,230
I'm going.

598
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,000
It is a cat.

599
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,840
Mikey.

600
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,340
Look, I expect this much from the barfield, but I'm not waiting four

601
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,539
hours for my stupid mission in heaven for hours.

602
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,440
I'll get to your ugly mug.

603
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,039
Once I finish up with the lady.

604
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,440
It's fine.

605
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,889
I don't mind if he stays red.

606
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,090
What are you doing in here?

607
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,789
Suit yourself, sweetheart.

608
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,590
Go ahead.

609
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,289
Wise guy.

610
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,389
Take a frequency.

611
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:13,090
Now listen up because I'm only going to say this once you got 10 days here.

612
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:17,289
The HCA will be rating your performance alongside the other competing

613
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,989
eons and whoever has the top score.

614
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:22,789
And if they can win, I'm going to be this for Halloween this year.

615
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,789
Don't steal my costume.

616
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,190
I'm showing up to the party like this.

617
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:26,989
You better not.

618
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,789
We both have the same neon white costume.

619
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,389
It's going to be it's going to be not cool.

620
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
I chose it first.

621
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,000
No, no, I set it out loud first.

622
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
I set it out loud first.

623
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,960
You jokers will be cleaning out lower heaven.

624
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,860
Sounds easy enough.

625
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:00,739
The Dracula.

626
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,760
Because the demons got him white.

627
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,659
I forgot about the Dracula costume.

628
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:11,159
That's right.

629
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,260
Yeah, I kind of got that.

630
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,159
Anyway, that just about covers it.

631
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,059
Any question?

632
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:20,460
Yeah.

633
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,460
Why are you a cat?

634
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,559
Okay, you're just saying whatever to me now.

635
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,659
I was actually wondering the same thing.

636
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,659
Why are you a hilarious cartoon cat?

637
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,659
Exactly.

638
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,559
You neons are all the same.

639
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,059
Oh, we're going to break that promise.

640
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,159
Moronic imagery.

641
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,059
Your pee brains embedded in an effort to comprehend as angels.

642
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,559
Oh, you're a cat.

643
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,460
You're a horse.

644
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,559
You're a sexy statue of Liberty.

645
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,460
How about a hey, Mikey?

646
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,659
How's your day, Mikey?

647
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,860
Excuse me.

648
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,159
I'm here for my appointment.

649
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,659
Hey, white, isn't it freaking crazy?

650
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,059
That John Cena is here in heaven giving us missions.

651
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,460
John Cena in this game?

652
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,360
Everybody out.

653
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,960
Don't come back till you finished your missions.

654
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,159
And Gabby, can you please keep these neons under control?

655
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:18,469
Hey, Red, before you go, I wanted to ask you if you knew what

656
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,170
the deal is with Green.

657
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:22,070
Stay away from him.

658
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,670
Uh-huh.

659
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:23,269
He's...

660
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,070
I could use some convincing.

661
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,670
I suppose I could open up more.

662
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,369
In exchange for a favor.

663
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:29,670
Wait, really?

664
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,869
Keep your pants on.

665
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:32,469
What's the favor?

666
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:33,070
What will that be?

667
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,369
Like, after this mission?

668
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,710
What's all this commotion about?

669
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,210
It's piña colada day at the pool.

670
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,909
So?

671
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:47,210
Heaven's piña coladas are to die for.

672
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,309
That's kind of good.

673
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,909
We'll see about that.

674
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,010
Oh, no, you won't.

675
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,909
I, really?

676
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,909
A sinner partaking in heaven's delight?

677
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,909
That's bull.

678
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:00,010
Stay back, neon, or I'll have you blown to bits.

679
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:00,909
Argh.

680
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,750
Are you...

681
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,150
Another cat.

682
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,849
You said you wanted a drink, right?

683
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,150
I know a place.

684
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,750
Follow me.

685
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:13,449
Why not?

686
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,219
Tada!

687
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,619
Welcome to the neon bar.

688
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:21,219
You like it?

689
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,619
Oh, it's not like the rest of heaven.

690
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:24,320
That's for sure.

691
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,019
I'm into it.

692
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,920
Thanks.

693
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,820
Can I actually order drinks?

694
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Does it give me booze?

695
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:33,420
So, uh, who exactly are you?

696
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,420
You can call me Raz.

697
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm the bartender here.

698
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,829
Raz.

699
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,250
I'm imagining you probably buy cards, booze.

700
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:43,849
White.

701
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,150
Well, white?

702
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,250
Good to meet you.

703
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:48,150
Believers don't come around these parts anymore.

704
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,750
So, it's the perfect place for neon to take a load off.

705
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:53,650
I like the sound of that.

706
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,449
What do you have?

707
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:55,949
How about one of those piña coladas?

708
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:56,449
On it.

709
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:00,519
Here you go.

710
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:01,119
What the?

711
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,119
This is literally just water.

712
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:04,619
Sorry.

713
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:07,619
The believers are hogging all the real stuff.

714
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:08,019
What?

715
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,019
How can you call this a bar if you don't serve any booze?

716
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,619
See, you're thinking too narrow.

717
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,320
A bar, give you one guy, you can fight it in another guy.

718
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:19,019
What?

719
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:20,119
Where's my piña colada?

720
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm just saying.

721
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,119
A friend and folks in heaven has its benefits.

722
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,119
You'd be surprised by what you can gain from chatting people up.

723
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:29,519
And maybe giving them some gifts.

724
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:33,019
The believers wouldn't accept my piña colada patronage.

725
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:35,619
I doubt they'd let me into their crappy gift shop.

726
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,820
Well, no.

727
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,619
Once you've taken care of your missions, you can do a second

728
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,119
sweep to hunt for presents.

729
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,920
It's like a pain.

730
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,420
White.

731
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,920
And hey, if you give me a gift.

732
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,130
All right, let's go.

733
00:44:59,239 --> 00:44:59,940
Lemon water.

734
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,440
Pause.

735
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:01,739
There you are.

736
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:03,139
Team up with me.

737
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,239
Jinx Vi, you owe me a coat.

738
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,780
Yellow, quit getting in my way.

739
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,980
So I have to choose a companion.

740
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:17,579
Join me.

741
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:20,900
And clearly the cutest choice here.

742
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,199
I don't know.

743
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,699
I'm pretty freaking cute.

744
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:27,400
Guys, guys, I'm flattered, but this is a competition.

745
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm not here to make friends.

746
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,400
Yo, I totally get you.

747
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,599
That's why we should all team up.

748
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,099
No way.

749
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,800
Three's a crowd.

750
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'd rather eat my own pancreas.

751
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,199
Come on, Vi.

752
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,000
You sure?

753
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,699
And lone wolf here.

754
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,300
I'm not teaming up with.

755
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,400
You know, I met this other neon earlier who was a total simp.

756
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:51,199
Maybe I'll just go play with him instead.

757
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,800
Oh, what?

758
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:54,699
Who?

759
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Looks like it's just you and me, bro.

760
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:05,730
All right.

761
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,230
So do I have a do I have a power or something with them?

762
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

763
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

764
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,130
I'm not ready.

765
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:22,739
Am I going too slow?

766
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:38,869
Fuck.

767
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:08,170
That was pretty.

768
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:09,170
That was pretty good.

769
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,369
That was gold.

770
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:13,480
I'll take gold.

771
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,510
I knew you would be bad at Splatoon story mode.

772
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:22,969
True.

773
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:30,510
Godspeed soul card.

774
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,139
The soul card fires like a semi-automatic rifle and you get a dash

775
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,539
dash horizontally in the direction you're aiming.

776
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,940
Stores demons and breakable objects.

777
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:41,539
How far is it?

778
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:41,840
Okay.

779
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,449
Oh, that was sad, but I can do it.

780
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:54,949
Okay.

781
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:55,650
No, no, no, no, no.

782
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:57,150
We're doing that again.

783
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,550
Doing that again.

784
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,900
Oh, I can't just cheat.

785
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,949
Can I just cheat?

786
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,179
So it doesn't okay.

787
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,280
You can't get any vertical.

788
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,679
You can.

789
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:21,880
It's only horizontal only.

790
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:28,960
Wait a minute.

791
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,789
Can I break this without dashing?

792
00:48:53,039 --> 00:49:17,219
Oh, well 13 another one down cold only use the first Godspeed

793
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:17,820
to get on the podium.

794
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,619
You just jump interesting.

795
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,019
Oh, that was a bonehead move.

796
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,559
I can take it.

797
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:43,260
I can do that better.

798
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,460
How much faster do I have to do 1817?

799
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:49,489
Now I can do 19.

800
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,559
How do I get that?

801
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:05,739
Wait, that's me.

802
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,800
There it is.

803
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:31,849
Yippee.

804
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,010
This is a perfect game for a fake manga fan like you.

805
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:48,440
I see it.

806
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,440
Oops.

807
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:57,320
Only one shot just that instantly.

808
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,690
Where do I go?

809
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:29,949
Shit.

810
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,650
Hey, let's keep it going.

811
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,630
22 seconds.

812
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,230
I can do it.

813
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:55,550
So if you dash through you get another one platinum.

814
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:57,219
That's how it's done.

815
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,659
Hey, I missed some of the stream.

816
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,760
Did he go to hell and was Ben Franklin there?

817
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,079
I'm not sure yet.

818
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,360
Hell, yeah, dude.

819
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:18,409
Oh, wait.

820
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:18,710
Okay.

821
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,710
This is a double here.

822
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,500
This is a grab this shoot and then this is a boom.

823
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:24,800
Boom.

824
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,719
I think somebody was alive up there.

825
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:35,170
I can't really tell but whatever.

826
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:37,420
Oh my God.

827
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,119
I blew it.

828
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:39,420
I thought that somebody was still alive.

829
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,219
Oh, it's just it's one of the other neons.

830
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:42,519
Okay.

831
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:43,320
I thought it was an enemy.

832
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:48,730
What?

833
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,659
No.

834
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh, only silver.

835
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,699
What am I missing here?

836
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:26,860
12 seconds.

837
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,760
What am I missing here?

838
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,289
Ah, all right.

839
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:43,889
Settle down.

840
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,000
The dash somebody said the dash does go vertical.

841
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,099
I can't get it to go vertical.

842
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,059
Does the dash work?

843
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:22,260
Okay.

844
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,559
When you hit an enemy with the dash, does it actually just refill it?

845
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:27,539
Doesn't only on those big ones.

846
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,860
I mean, how do I get up there that fast?

847
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,750
Damn it.

848
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,849
I lost time on that.

849
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,039
Skip dropping down.

850
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:06,639
Just dash.

851
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:22,829
Shit.

852
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:49,820
Wait, now I have to break that.

853
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,320
I have to kill the enemy down there.

854
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:52,619
Skip the second door.

855
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,119
I still have to kill the thing down there though, right?

856
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,900
Shoot it and then dash to the exit.

857
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:13,199
God damn it.

858
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,010
My brain can't do it.

859
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:30,269
I mean it can but it's just too many things in a row.

860
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:35,739
All right.

861
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:42,250
So, but how how do I skip?

862
00:56:42,449 --> 00:56:47,050
How do I kill that but skip the door without getting the jump?

863
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,030
I get it.

864
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,659
Just go from here to there.

865
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:57,840
Let me take, let me go slow.

866
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:06,599
Okay.

867
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,980
I just go like this.

868
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:11,489
All right.

869
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:11,989
That's how you do it.

870
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:12,389
I got it.

871
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,519
Yes.

872
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,820
Let's see anyone beat that.

873
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:36,130
I wonder if you can even do it normally.

874
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:37,570
This is a fun game.

875
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:37,969
I like this.

876
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,960
Come on already.

877
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,260
Quit it with the jokes.

878
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:48,510
I can't help it.

879
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:49,010
Yeah.

880
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:49,710
Yeah.

881
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:51,309
You and your sunshine.

882
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:53,639
Did you do something quirky?

883
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:56,940
Hey.

884
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:58,239
No.

885
00:57:58,539 --> 00:57:59,039
Sorry.

886
00:57:59,139 --> 00:57:59,639
I don't.

887
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,639
Sounds like it was chill though.

888
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:02,139
Oh great.

889
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:03,039
He said he liked the game.

890
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:05,139
Prepare to never see it after this stream.

891
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:16,019
Man, I'd give my left nut to go back and do it all over again.

892
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,219
Even all the weird stuff at the end.

893
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,659
I don't blame you for any of it, you know.

894
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,739
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

895
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:28,739
Dude, chill.

896
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,639
The vibes are immaculate.

897
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,340
What?

898
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,840
I just want to kick ass with my bro.

899
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,840
Did you just say that?

900
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:36,039
You just said the vibes are immaculate?

901
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:39,719
Really?

902
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,960
Wow.

903
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,059
Okay.

904
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,929
I like this guy way more now.

905
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

906
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,679
My god, dude.

907
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,579
Remember when you messed up the toilet after you ate that chili?

908
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,980
That was insane.

909
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,179
Yo, hold up.

910
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,280
Wait, what?

911
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,179
That's not, why would you, that's a weird thing to bring up to somebody.

912
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:05,780
That's weird.

913
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,079
That's fucking strange.

914
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:14,699
I don't know what that's distracting me.

915
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:15,400
I don't know what that's for.

916
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,469
That was very distracting, but I think I still got the gold medal.

917
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:24,670
Didn't even break a sweat.

918
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:34,460
Every cutscene loses like 400 viewers.

919
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,360
That's pretty funny.

920
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,960
That's actually funny.

921
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,360
Shit, I fell.

922
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,079
Shit, I fell again.

923
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:59,210
Every cutscene loses 500 viewers.

924
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:13,360
A long way.

925
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,610
How did I lose time?

926
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,659
Oh, it's...

927
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,820
Yeah, that sounds good.

928
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,329
Stop jumping.

929
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:54,630
I, doesn't do anything.

930
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,929
Damn it.

931
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:09,329
Yeah.

932
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,159
I feel like I was pretty close to the platinum one.

933
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:14,860
Let me see.

934
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:22,590
Probably one or two seconds.

935
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:24,730
I can definitely get it.

936
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:25,329
Let's get it.

937
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:42,099
Oh, sad.

938
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:25,210
Bounce to platinum.

939
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,329
It's because I'm the best.

940
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:30,489
I think your Vtuber avatar isn't rigged right.

941
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:31,489
The space isn't moving.

942
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,559
I feel like I just lost time there.

943
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,679
Let's do that again.

944
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,110
That's definitely the best way to go.

945
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:04,760
Get a land right on the lip.

946
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,860
I did it too, shit.

947
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,119
That's definitely it.

948
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,980
That might have been more accurate.

949
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,730
Didn't even break a sweat.

950
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,329
Unfortunate.

951
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,019
You just have to hop over the side.

952
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,590
26?

953
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,190
Oh, yeah, I can have that.

954
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,989
That extra second was just the beginning.

955
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,409
I know I'm supposed to get the presence, but whatever.

956
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,380
There it is.

957
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,050
That's how it's done.

958
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,329
To do a Ben and Jerry's tier list.

959
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:49,130
Half-baked S.

960
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:51,130
Everything else A.

961
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,130
Everything else A.

962
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:56,659
I don't even need to show it on screen.

963
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:19,269
Oh, a little too, a little too far there.

964
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,800
I'm gonna hold this.

965
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,090
Damn it.

966
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,500
I'm holding it for way too long.

967
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,340
I can definitely do it.

968
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,650
A hundred percent.

969
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:09,050
Ready?

970
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,800
Oh, fuck you.

971
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,699
I can definitely do it.

972
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,599
That's gonna shave like three seconds off too.

973
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:28,929
Oh, come on.

974
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,059
I know I can do it.

975
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,099
It's dope.

976
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:46,300
Yeah, it's right there.

977
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:46,800
But whatever.

978
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,199
Let's try it the regular way.

979
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,659
Guess I could shoot and skip this whole thing.

980
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:12,969
I'm gonna skip that whole section.

981
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:26,130
I freaked out.

982
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,130
I need to, where do I go?

983
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:29,019
Hold on.

984
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:31,699
Where is it?

985
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,300
Hold on.

986
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,900
I'm freaking out.

987
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:39,980
I need to see it again.

988
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:43,420
Because it's bounce off.

989
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:44,420
Okay, it's over here.

990
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,659
Can I just skip this whole section?

991
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,739
I shoot those two in the beginning.

992
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,739
Need to end up up there.

993
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:56,579
Okay.

994
01:07:59,019 --> 01:07:59,519
See it up.

995
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,690
I don't, maybe I can't.

996
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:46,850
That's still gold somehow.

997
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,250
What is it?

998
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:47,850
What is platinum?

999
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:54,649
All right.

1000
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:57,420
That's pretty fair amount that I still need to do.

1001
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,020
Let me try that again.

1002
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,510
Oh, it's gone.

1003
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:04,909
Oops.

1004
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:23,539
Oh, there it is.

1005
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,479
No.

1006
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:29,579
I know where to go.

1007
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,699
You stupid idiot.

1008
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:24,930
Platinum.

1009
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:26,229
It's because I'm the best.

1010
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,199
All right.

1011
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,199
This is the last level here.

1012
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,300
In this particular zone.

1013
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:54,529
I mean, we're kind of just going here.

1014
01:10:54,829 --> 01:11:08,199
Oh, it was kind of ugly.

1015
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:08,800
But sorry.

1016
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
I wonder where the skips are here.

1017
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,270
I think I could just do just go faster and I should get it.

1018
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,020
I blew it.

1019
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:57,859
All right.

1020
01:11:57,859 --> 01:11:59,460
Even break a sweat 22.

1021
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,460
I'm making a lot of noises.

1022
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:00,760
Sorry.

1023
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,159
I can go faster.

1024
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:06,159
I just got to get the whole thing down.

1025
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:06,560
I'll get it.

1026
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,699
Just skip that whole top part.

1027
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:11,020
Let me look at it.

1028
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,619
Look at that.

1029
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,689
I'm so I'm getting so I'm getting ahead of myself.

1030
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:48,970
Oh, fuck you.

1031
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:45,529
Oh, 23.9 shit in my pants.

1032
01:13:45,529 --> 01:13:46,630
23.3.

1033
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,399
Fuck you.

1034
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:31,699
Shit.

1035
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:40,859
How?

1036
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:57,510
Oh, you idiot.

1037
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:58,310
I hate you.

1038
01:15:01,149 --> 01:15:01,850
It's falling apart.

1039
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,649
It's falling apart.

1040
01:15:02,649 --> 01:15:02,949
It's false.

1041
01:15:02,949 --> 01:15:03,550
I gotta get back.

1042
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:03,949
Come on.

1043
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,260
What are you talking about game?

1044
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,060
What are you happening?

1045
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:22,060
What?

1046
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:22,960
I didn't go through.

1047
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,359
Why?

1048
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,020
How is that?

1049
01:15:57,949 --> 01:15:58,649
It's falling apart.

1050
01:16:04,449 --> 01:16:05,550
Is that even faster?

1051
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:08,350
It might that might be adding time by the way.

1052
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,319
That's adding time.

1053
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,760
Oh, you piece of shit.

1054
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:00,890
20.

1055
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,289
Oh my God.

1056
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:14,720
I don't like this guy in front of me.

1057
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,520
I don't like it.

1058
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,420
He's he's doing way better than me every time.

1059
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,020
It's annoying.

1060
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,100
Wait a minute.

1061
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:27,600
Hold on.

1062
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,500
Hold on a second.

1063
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:30,699
I may have just solved it.

1064
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:44,590
Oh, yeah.

1065
01:17:47,569 --> 01:17:48,470
I don't think I can get high enough.

1066
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:05,970
Somebody said shoot the glass.

1067
01:18:06,069 --> 01:18:06,770
I don't think that works.

1068
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,199
I don't think I can get that high.

1069
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,649
Just look at the hand icon.

1070
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,020
Where is it?

1071
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:37,619
Oh, I see it over there.

1072
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:43,729
What does it want me to do though?

1073
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:44,130
Hold on.

1074
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,729
I'm going to jump this way.

1075
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:50,720
I get it.

1076
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:09,380
I mean, this is slop.

1077
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,579
This is fucking sloppy.

1078
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:13,159
So how many more demons are there?

1079
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:15,869
Or where are they?

1080
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:17,210
One, two, three.

1081
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:17,909
Okay, I get it.

1082
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:29,189
Oh, come on.

1083
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:34,329
Didn't mean to click twice.

1084
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,130
When you do the same level like a hundred times, sometimes your

1085
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,229
brain just is like, you know what?

1086
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:39,630
Just do it terribly this time.

1087
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,100
And do it terribly ten times in a row.

1088
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,460
Still might be all right.

1089
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:04,920
Yeah, I got it.

1090
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,399
I got the platinum.

1091
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:10,100
I got the platinum.

1092
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:10,699
I got the platinum.

1093
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:16,149
That's a platinum on every level, isn't it?

1094
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:22,380
I like it.

1095
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:33,199
I gotta admit that was pretty hard.

1096
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,100
Do we lose four to 500 viewers?

1097
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,600
Let's see.

1098
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,979
It's kind of the end of the show and

1099
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,380
every people are just standing up and walking.

1100
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:54,079
The show is not done, but people are just getting up out of their

1101
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:55,680
seats and walking out.

1102
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:01,140
What we're in the bottom of the ninth inning and my team is up

1103
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,039
by a hundred and fifty runs.

1104
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:08,840
So that's about a dozen for me and the kids tonight.

1105
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,239
We're going to go home.

1106
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:14,670
Wait, I'm not starting to like this guy.

1107
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,069
Am I?

1108
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,520
This is part of his plan.

1109
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:21,119
Waiting for me to let my hey, it's all good.

1110
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:22,720
It doesn't matter for 10,000 people.

1111
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:26,220
You know, here's your it could be a thousand of you hanging

1112
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,220
out here and I still do it.

1113
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:37,949
What about 10?

1114
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:42,369
Nah, actually at least 12.

1115
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:46,819
Yo, I didn't think I'd actually get to save your life this

1116
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:47,420
fast.

1117
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:52,689
You really got to be more careful, bro.

1118
01:21:52,989 --> 01:21:54,890
Here, take my hand.

1119
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:03,970
I was like the concept of a second channel, but I had

1120
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:08,569
Nah, if I'm going to be just kind of chilling out here and

1121
01:22:08,569 --> 01:22:11,470
whatever if you're either here or you're not you didn't save

1122
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,670
Jack dumbass a second channel is an act.

1123
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,470
I don't know what I feel like I would just do the same thing

1124
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:20,260
I'm doing right now in act.

1125
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:25,949
Yeah to see how easily I could have sliced you a master of

1126
01:22:25,949 --> 01:22:26,449
comedy.

1127
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:32,350
You freaking crack me up, dude.

1128
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,970
Yeah, I'm just gonna do whatever.

1129
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:38,899
We're just gonna do whatever what if there's one thing that

1130
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:43,000
means 5,000 people leave hard, but you really got whatever

1131
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,140
who cares wouldn't be best bros.

1132
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:51,979
If I did who gives a crap my back and like vice-visa next

1133
01:22:51,979 --> 01:22:54,079
time I'll save you for real.

1134
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,180
Tell even worse jokes on a second channel.

1135
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:10,760
Dead guy, huh?

1136
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:12,260
Oh shit viewers increasing.

1137
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:14,659
No, no, that's we don't want that.

1138
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:17,970
We want to we want to drop below 10k.

1139
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,470
We don't want to have there be more people.

1140
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:24,989
Welcome back Neons you survived your first mission but

1141
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:28,090
surviving is not the same as winning.

1142
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,060
Please direct your attention to greens mechanical halo a

1143
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:39,760
mechanism that grants Neons the ability to stay in heaven.

1144
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,189
Get them out of here.

1145
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:43,989
We're looking for negative growth.

1146
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,159
I say I want to hit negative growth.

1147
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,460
I want people to I want less people to be here.

1148
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,699
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

1149
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:55,199
I want I want that the least amount of people to be here

1150
01:23:55,699 --> 01:24:00,609
that could be what negative growth not a single neon has

1151
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:03,010
come close to overtaking green score.

1152
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:07,210
He's defended his position at the top for many years now

1153
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:11,010
and I I don't imagine he intends to give it up now.

1154
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,239
Not when he's made such a comfortable home for himself here

1155
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:21,819
in paradise, isn't that the stomach are you saying that even

1156
01:24:21,819 --> 01:24:24,920
if we win we don't get to stay in heaven forever.

1157
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,319
Oh goodness.

1158
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:34,880
No God's mercy has its limits and an expiration date seriously.

1159
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,380
That's such a rebel.

1160
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:42,989
If you'd prefer the flames of hell for eternity to a year

1161
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:53,680
of heavenly delights and be my guest dark and darker do better.

1162
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,000
I have seen a lot of people playing it on stream.

1163
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,250
I know they added a couple of classes right staring at me

1164
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:04,750
again.

1165
01:25:13,729 --> 01:25:15,630
I'm not trying to skip dialogue.

1166
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:18,829
I'm just trying to get us to a position where I can do the

1167
01:25:18,829 --> 01:25:23,720
next chapter in the time that I would like to continue to

1168
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:28,819
stream so it's not about skipping the dialogue but getting

1169
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:32,300
to the action so I can do the chapter so I can continue to

1170
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:40,800
play it in the time that I would like to be streaming you

1171
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,000
are bad tone acts.

1172
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,500
Let's see.

1173
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,000
Well, look at that.

1174
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,800
You've earned yourself a heavenly delight.

1175
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,460
One moment while I check in go ahead and take a it's all the

1176
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,659
people I get the cool.

1177
01:25:53,859 --> 01:26:00,470
I'm not I'm not skipping this but I'm just okay.

1178
01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:10,300
Okay, I want to do the section and that's probably going to

1179
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,300
be the end of the stream.

1180
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,600
But I do want to do this.

1181
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,699
What I'm so glad I ran into you.

1182
01:26:15,699 --> 01:26:16,899
Mikey must have thought I was.

1183
01:26:16,899 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah, what the heck.

1184
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,000
You mean?

1185
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Yeah, what is it with you?

1186
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,600
Sorry.

1187
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:25,899
You really don't remember anything.

1188
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,100
This is important dialogue back when we were alive yellow

1189
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,800
did some messed up stuff.

1190
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,199
He got tangled up with some shady character.

1191
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:36,199
It was you who's are we talking about the same?

1192
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:37,800
Yeah, that's silly.

1193
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:43,819
Let's go.

1194
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:51,510
Okay, I got it.

1195
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:54,479
Come on.

1196
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:57,479
Wait, come on.

1197
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:20,279
Wait, I cannot kill that is just line of sight.

1198
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:35,489
Wait a minute.

1199
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,489
That's pretty stupid.

1200
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:46,100
Uh-huh.

1201
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,500
Okay.

1202
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,020
Fuck.

1203
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,619
I don't get it.

1204
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,529
I mean I do but I don't because you have to kill everything.

1205
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:10,039
So how would does that count as a demon do I actually have

1206
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:30,909
to kill this thing is it hold on it does count not make that

1207
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:35,619
I guess I that was very slow.

1208
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:37,789
I'm even going right way.

1209
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:42,510
Wait, what the hell is down here?

1210
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:47,880
Okay, hold on.

1211
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:23,050
I feel like this is done very poorly but whatever.

1212
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,829
No.

1213
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:31,430
Yeah, not bad.

1214
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:34,729
Could be but could be better but okay.

1215
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,180
It's a lot of time to shave off.

1216
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:43,689
I might come back to it.

1217
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,590
Yeah, gold's gold's good.

1218
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:50,590
Don't get platinum on every single one.

1219
01:29:52,069 --> 01:29:54,670
The machine gun stomp on the ground to create a large blast

1220
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:57,069
that destroys most demons and breakable objects.

1221
01:29:58,199 --> 01:29:59,199
Very clear.

1222
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,119
I think that's everybody.

1223
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,149
Yuck.

1224
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:34,840
Yeah, that that was yuck.

1225
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:48,800
I wonder if I can think I'm going to skip that whole part.

1226
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:04,600
Wait, let's get that part too.

1227
01:31:29,539 --> 01:31:30,840
Oh, I missed.

1228
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:38,819
I'll get it.

1229
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:57,210
Bottom, right?

1230
01:31:57,409 --> 01:31:59,479
Yeah, did you see that?

1231
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,850
Hey viewer, did you pet your pet today?

1232
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:06,949
Go show them some love.

1233
01:32:06,949 --> 01:32:07,449
I agree.

1234
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:43,029
I don't know where to go.

1235
01:32:47,489 --> 01:32:47,890
Yuck.

1236
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,539
I can get a couple seconds shaved off of that.

1237
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:08,310
I think that's actually the play.

1238
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,210
No, it's not.

1239
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:09,609
Not at all.

1240
01:33:38,899 --> 01:33:39,500
Funny.

1241
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:48,170
Yeah, I still can't believe the Winnie the Pooh question

1242
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:49,770
that I'm going to think about that for like a week.

1243
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:08,699
Maybe maybe no, I can't.

1244
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:15,539
That's I got to make that a lot cleaner.

1245
01:34:26,819 --> 01:34:27,520
Okay, cool.

1246
01:34:59,619 --> 01:35:00,819
Oh, what a mistake.

1247
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:45,140
What broke it the old and break a sweat.

1248
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:45,939
I could probably get platinum.

1249
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:55,859
What does it probably 19 18?

1250
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,260
I could do 20 that I should be able to get 20.

1251
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:17,270
Excuse me.

1252
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,069
What was there was a hint right there.

1253
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:20,270
Hold on.

1254
01:36:27,819 --> 01:36:28,720
What's the goal here?

1255
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,989
Oh, does that help?

1256
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:56,619
Well, okay.

1257
01:36:56,619 --> 01:36:58,420
Anyone beat that floppy, but I got it.

1258
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:12,239
Gonna dash through the door for more time.

1259
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,239
That's true.

1260
01:37:19,489 --> 01:37:20,390
I got caught right there.

1261
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:31,399
Oh, saving time.

1262
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:34,789
Yeah.

1263
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,859
How old do you think we are German?

1264
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:46,560
I think it I don't know.

1265
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:49,930
This is a pretty big range.

1266
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:04,880
I got stuck.

1267
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:05,279
Oops.

1268
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:06,180
Oh, it's over.

1269
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:07,840
Maybe not.

1270
01:38:11,539 --> 01:38:12,140
Hey, sorry.

1271
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,489
What's your target demographic?

1272
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:16,689
This is a mature audience stream.

1273
01:38:17,649 --> 01:38:21,380
Yeah, I'm really working up a sweat is the stream is for adults.

1274
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:23,899
Nevermind.

1275
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,199
You're not an adult.

1276
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:26,399
Get out of here.

1277
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,399
Neon orange.

1278
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,399
That's a fuck out of here.

1279
01:38:29,399 --> 01:38:31,100
If you're not an adult, the secret.

1280
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,100
Damn, that sucks.

1281
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:36,000
Tell me more about these secrets though.

1282
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:39,829
Are you gonna skip the story?

1283
01:38:40,729 --> 01:38:41,829
Yeah.

1284
01:38:43,729 --> 01:38:44,829
Damn, dude.

1285
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:48,529
I love it in all caps in the middle of this.

1286
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:50,430
Everybody leave it.

1287
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,630
It's a cutscene.

1288
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:55,329
And look what happened.

1289
01:38:57,619 --> 01:38:58,619
Actually, I think I'm all right with that.

1290
01:38:58,619 --> 01:39:00,020
I think I got the whole gist of what just happened.

1291
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,720
I'm okay with that.

1292
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,220
I think I understand everything.

1293
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:04,619
I've comprehended everything that happened.

1294
01:39:32,979 --> 01:39:33,479
Silver.

1295
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,220
That was a gold if I ever seen it.

1296
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:41,119
Yeah.

1297
01:39:58,350 --> 01:39:59,350
Why am I getting this?

1298
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:01,869
That's completely unnecessary.

1299
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:06,800
Another one down.

1300
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,699
Just skip that whole section.

1301
01:40:07,699 --> 01:40:11,369
I don't know why I'm getting the falling down so gently.

1302
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:28,470
There's a way to go down there, but I'm going to keep my tactic.

1303
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:36,119
My tactic didn't even wait one.

1304
01:40:38,180 --> 01:41:01,529
Oh, that's sad 1647.

1305
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:02,930
Yeah, I didn't even need to use the thing.

1306
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,829
See that don't even need the hand.

1307
01:41:04,829 --> 01:41:07,199
I got the ace medal without it.

1308
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:14,699
What I got in 13 seconds 14 seconds, but it's all good.

1309
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:26,380
Okay.

1310
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,060
All right.

1311
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:48,479
Oh, okay.

1312
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:49,279
Well, we'll try that again.

1313
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,750
That's a mess up right there.

1314
01:42:19,069 --> 01:42:21,170
I'm doing something really fucking wrong here.

1315
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:50,449
Better, but I keep losing momentum over there.

1316
01:43:03,609 --> 01:43:04,909
I bet I can skip that part.

1317
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:14,180
Whoa, I went way too high.

1318
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:24,960
Oh, it was long.

1319
01:43:41,699 --> 01:43:44,300
What part of your body did you wash last my hands?

1320
01:43:46,199 --> 01:43:46,699
Pretty good.

1321
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,100
Gotcha question though.

1322
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,140
Give her to shoot this guy too.

1323
01:44:05,649 --> 01:44:06,250
Oh fuck.

1324
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:13,319
No, I win.

1325
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:21,779
Yeah, I didn't know this where it was.

1326
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:33,970
Oh, I think that's doable without any shortcuts.

1327
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:36,569
That was terrible.

1328
01:44:36,569 --> 01:44:37,270
Let me try that again.

1329
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:56,560
Oh, come on.

1330
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:57,460
Let me try this too.

1331
01:44:59,670 --> 01:44:59,970
Ready?

1332
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:06,529
Okay.

1333
01:45:07,329 --> 01:45:07,930
That's all right.

1334
01:45:21,859 --> 01:45:23,659
Why did I fall?

1335
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,380
I shaved off a full second right there.

1336
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:54,170
Oh, oh fuck off.

1337
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:55,470
I don't I hate what this place.

1338
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:56,869
Bad placement.

1339
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:06,840
What is going on here?

1340
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,239
How come I keep just jumping over that?

1341
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,739
I have an idea.

1342
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,369
That idea was really dumb.

1343
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:24,970
Don't be impatient.

1344
01:46:25,369 --> 01:46:26,470
That's my entire life.

1345
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:31,069
My whole life has been being impatient.

1346
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:34,470
My entire existence is built off of being impatient.

1347
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,699
Everything you've ever seen, you've ever heard is because of my impatience.

1348
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:47,350
Oh, I fucked it up.

1349
01:46:57,319 --> 01:46:59,220
No, I used it.

1350
01:46:59,220 --> 01:46:59,920
It was stupid.

1351
01:47:03,899 --> 01:47:04,199
Where is it?

1352
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:04,600
Where is it?

1353
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,000
I know what to do.

1354
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,399
I got it.

1355
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:07,800
I got it.

1356
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,100
I got it.

1357
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:08,199
I got it.

1358
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:08,699
Just wait, wait, wait.

1359
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:22,039
Just shoot everything over there.

1360
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,720
I have to keep one of these.

1361
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,590
You idiot.

1362
01:47:38,189 --> 01:47:39,590
I even knew what I had to do too.

1363
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:41,430
I still did it wrong.

1364
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,630
My brain was like, do it like this.

1365
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:44,029
Do it like this.

1366
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:44,529
Do it like this.

1367
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:45,930
Oh, don't do it like that.

1368
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:47,619
Excuse me.

1369
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,800
Oh, why?

1370
01:47:55,899 --> 01:47:56,600
Why?

1371
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,699
Oh my God.

1372
01:47:57,699 --> 01:47:59,699
I just I started overthinking everything.

1373
01:48:03,789 --> 01:48:04,890
I didn't even want that thing equipped.

1374
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,789
I wanted the rifle.

1375
01:48:12,609 --> 01:48:13,909
I wanted the rifle equipped.

1376
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:15,010
This thing.

1377
01:48:18,729 --> 01:48:19,029
Okay.

1378
01:48:19,029 --> 01:48:19,630
Do it right.

1379
01:48:27,699 --> 01:48:28,600
I don't even know if it helps.

1380
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,159
Oh my God.

1381
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:38,760
Damn it.

1382
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:43,359
I just I keep getting there and forgetting the entire video game.

1383
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,750
I'm just like, yeah, jump, jump, jump.

1384
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:47,050
How do I?

1385
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:47,750
I don't know the buttons.

1386
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:48,350
How do I play?

1387
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,500
No, I need to jump.

1388
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,100
Oh my God.

1389
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,100
I'm about to skip the level.

1390
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:31,510
I know there's a hand over there, but I want to do I wanted to get it

1391
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,210
without the hand.

1392
01:49:51,609 --> 01:49:52,710
Does that even save time?

1393
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:53,810
Hard to tell.

1394
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:57,789
That was stupid.

1395
01:49:57,789 --> 01:49:58,689
That was really stupid.

1396
01:49:58,689 --> 01:49:59,789
That was so stupid.

1397
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:06,579
I'm just not just go just go to go.

1398
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:07,880
I'm going to get stuck here for like four hours.

1399
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,979
Just go just end it.

1400
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:45,510
Excuse me.

1401
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:47,350
That's got to be platinum.

1402
01:50:47,949 --> 01:50:49,250
They didn't even break a sweat.

1403
01:50:51,659 --> 01:50:52,960
Excuse me.

1404
01:50:53,729 --> 01:50:55,930
It's been exclaiming random loud sounds today.

1405
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,720
I'll give it one or two more attempts because this one was fun.

1406
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:11,600
That was that was yucky.

1407
01:51:15,329 --> 01:51:15,829
What was that?

1408
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:38,390
Okay, I'm done.

1409
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,689
I'm done.

1410
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:38,989
I'm done.

1411
01:51:38,989 --> 01:51:39,189
I'm done.

1412
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,800
Oh, shut up.

1413
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,800
That's so stupid.

1414
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,300
That lip should not be as loud.

1415
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:02,800
You know what I mean?

1416
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,560
That was dumb.

1417
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:25,539
Oh, I thought I had one more.

1418
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:27,539
Oh, this game just hurts my brain.

1419
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:30,939
I thought I had one more dash.

1420
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:33,420
Oh, now it's all falling apart.

1421
01:52:33,619 --> 01:52:34,420
I'm gonna just keep going.

1422
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:57,819
What the fuck?

1423
01:52:57,819 --> 01:52:59,119
I didn't land.

1424
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:22,409
Stupid game actually stupid games that like how come on.

1425
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,979
I should have went through annoying.

1426
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,600
Oh, shut up.

1427
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:58,300
That's why I didn't have to because sometimes things stupid.

1428
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,859
What the fuck happened there?

1429
01:54:01,539 --> 01:54:02,439
What happened there?

1430
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:03,539
What happened?

1431
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,840
Why did I not launch?

1432
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,159
I should why did I not hit the barrel?

1433
01:54:16,819 --> 01:54:17,619
Gamer fatigue.

1434
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,220
This is gamer fatigue for sure.

1435
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,520
A hundred percent.

1436
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:39,689
Here we go.

1437
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:49,550
I had the other dash.

1438
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:51,250
I had the other dash.

1439
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,149
I just didn't use it.

1440
01:54:52,149 --> 01:54:52,550
All right.

1441
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,949
Come on.

1442
01:54:52,949 --> 01:54:53,550
This is the one.

1443
01:55:17,329 --> 01:55:21,529
Why did he not hit the barrel rewind it and play it a thousand times in a row?

1444
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:33,210
The barrel is a gigantic pit box.

1445
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:34,109
How am I not hitting it?

1446
01:55:54,689 --> 01:55:55,489
That's got to be it.

1447
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:57,359
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

1448
01:56:01,529 --> 01:56:04,630
Oh, I can do it.

1449
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:07,859
It's just like walk up the edge.

1450
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:19,159
Oh, shut up.

1451
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:43,640
Fuck you.

1452
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,340
Oh my God.

1453
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:51,350
I move on.

1454
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,140
All right.

1455
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,239
I think I missed a few people.

1456
01:57:31,329 --> 01:57:39,670
Oh, I'll take it.

1457
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:40,369
I'll take it.

1458
01:57:40,369 --> 01:57:40,670
I'll take it.

1459
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:40,970
I'll take it.

1460
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:41,369
I'll take it.

1461
01:57:44,579 --> 01:57:45,380
How do you like the break?

1462
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:47,079
I'll always do this soundtrack is great.

1463
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:57,439
Oh, I was so close.

1464
01:58:20,649 --> 01:58:22,050
I'm trying to go so fast.

1465
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,600
Yes, that's how it's done.

1466
01:58:58,300 --> 01:58:58,600
All right.

1467
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:59,600
That's a good one to go out on.

1468
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:07,930
Your addiction is showing.

1469
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:13,039
I understand why a lot of you like this game.

1470
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,659
I'm kind of freaking out, but it's okay.

1471
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:28,159
It working.

1472
01:59:50,659 --> 01:59:51,260
That's not good.

1473
02:00:00,579 --> 02:00:02,380
See, I keep I fell off that one last time too.

1474
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:34,270
Oh fuck better.

1475
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:40,869
Yeah, you haven't beaten Tomar in a single level.

1476
02:00:42,189 --> 02:00:42,590
Yeah.

1477
02:00:44,199 --> 02:00:44,899
Have I not?

1478
02:00:49,529 --> 02:00:50,630
Well, whatever.

1479
02:00:50,829 --> 02:00:51,430
That's all right.

1480
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,199
21.3.

1481
02:00:57,590 --> 02:01:04,689
Bro, you're a snail.

1482
02:01:08,199 --> 02:01:11,399
Do you think heaven has any hot springs we could soak in?

1483
02:01:18,819 --> 02:01:20,119
That's for a dead guy, huh?

1484
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:24,890
Not skipping because I want to.

1485
02:01:24,890 --> 02:01:29,880
I'm skipping because I'm skipping the toilet or whatever.

1486
02:01:32,609 --> 02:01:35,609
Looks like the believers are late to their own damn sermon.

1487
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:44,300
I'd feel weird.

1488
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,300
Come here often.

1489
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,600
Wait, we're not skipping this part.

1490
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,000
Just one of my little jokes.

1491
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,399
Sinners have a great sense of humor.

1492
02:01:53,399 --> 02:01:56,000
You must have had quite an idyllic childhood.

1493
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,600
Anyway, you know your way around heaven, right?

1494
02:02:01,779 --> 02:02:04,880
If you fight green, you will absolutely lose.

1495
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:18,390
I think I figured out what was going on and that's the end of the stream.

1496
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:19,090
Thanks for watching.

1497
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,859
I know that a lot of you saying that he's never going to play this game again,

1498
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:28,880
but I think I might disagree with you.

1499
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:36,859
I feel like I'm having fun with this one.

1500
02:02:39,899 --> 02:02:43,500
But let's go over the remainder of the week coming up here.

1501
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:51,399
So next time I stream will probably be on Tuesday or Wednesday.

1502
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,529
I'm going to do Sorcery Part 4.

1503
02:02:54,779 --> 02:02:59,359
And then at some point during the weekend, I'd imagine probably Tuesday.

1504
02:03:02,659 --> 02:03:05,520
Tuesday around this time, five or six.

1505
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:12,590
And then this weekend coming up, really going to try to get the Man vs.

1506
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:13,390
Machine stuff going.

1507
02:03:14,699 --> 02:03:18,340
So that weekend of the 18th, 19th, 20th, there are other streamers.

1508
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:21,439
I need to make sure everyone can do the same day because I know that some

1509
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:28,489
scheduling conflicts exist somewhere in that Saturday, Sunday.

1510
02:03:28,689 --> 02:03:32,189
Really want to if a bunch of the people can't do it that I really want to play

1511
02:03:32,189 --> 02:03:34,189
it with and we'll figure it out.

1512
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:35,720
We'll move it around.

1513
02:03:37,239 --> 02:03:42,119
But Sorcery Part 4 on Tuesday starting around five or six o'clock at night.

1514
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:48,449
And we'll do MVM that end of the weekend there.

1515
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:55,850
And maybe I'll play this again.

1516
02:03:56,439 --> 02:03:57,840
Just kind of hanging out one night.

1517
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:05,010
Yeah, I'm very excited for Man vs.

1518
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:05,409
Machine.

1519
02:04:06,909 --> 02:04:08,010
I've not played Man vs.

1520
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:10,109
Machine in a really, really long time.

1521
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:18,510
Getting a bunch of streamer buddies in there should be a lot of fun.

1522
02:04:18,609 --> 02:04:21,310
Especially the harder ones because that TF2 Man vs.

1523
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:24,939
Machine, some of those tours are really, really hard.

1524
02:04:25,239 --> 02:04:26,039
They don't mess around.

1525
02:04:38,489 --> 02:04:39,890
Wave 666.

1526
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:40,989
I don't know about that.

1527
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:52,939
Take care of yourselves.

1528
02:04:52,939 --> 02:04:53,739
Thanks for watching.

1529
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:59,789
I'll see you guys on Tuesday for Sorcery Part 4.

1530
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,539
Sorcery Enjoyers have been waiting a long time.

1531
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:10,029
So let's feed them to feed the Sorcery 4 Andes.

1532
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:17,039
I told you I wasn't going to wait that long.

1533
02:05:18,689 --> 02:05:20,989
We're not going to finish it on Tuesday, but we'll start it.

1534
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,159
We take us three or four sessions to do it.

1535
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,840
Yeah, take care.

1536
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,500
Play viewfinder.

1537
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:43,720
Yeah, I'll find time to throw in just like a chill stream again.

1538
02:05:45,989 --> 02:05:47,390
I think most of them are chill streams now.

1539
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:50,289
I like it though.

1540
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:52,819
Having a lot of fun doing this.

1541
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:56,579
I'm back to the basics.

1542
02:06:03,789 --> 02:06:05,090
Baldur's Gate 3.

1543
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:05,689
I don't know.

1544
02:06:05,689 --> 02:06:06,489
Maybe.

1545
02:06:07,479 --> 02:06:09,279
All your streams are evil.

1546
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:11,949
Evil.

1547
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:15,420
Agree.

1548
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:21,329
Evil was capital by the way.

1549
02:06:21,729 --> 02:06:22,130
Evil.

1550
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,460
Yeah, take care of yourselves.

1551
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,199
Have a great weekend.

1552
02:06:33,529 --> 02:06:34,130
See you on Tuesday.

1553
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,800
Voices of the Void.

1554
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,399
What is Voices of the Void?

1555
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:43,859
Is it a new game?

1556
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,399
Great game.

1557
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:02,520
Look into it.

1558
02:07:02,819 --> 02:07:04,119
And I don't mean that in quotes.

1559
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:05,819
I'm actually going to look into it.

1560
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:10,260
All right guys.

1561
02:07:10,359 --> 02:07:10,859
See you later.

1562
02:07:12,359 --> 02:07:12,859
Call your mother.

1563
02:07:14,609 --> 02:07:15,310
Call your father too.

1564
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:18,899
You know what?

1565
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,899
Get everybody in the room and play Monopoly.

1566
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,100
When was the last time you played Monopoly?

1567
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:29,590
Play Monopoly.

1568
02:07:29,689 --> 02:07:30,189
It's 1 a.m.

1569
02:07:30,189 --> 02:07:31,090
They're all asleep.

1570
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:32,489
Call them tomorrow.

1571
02:07:35,079 --> 02:07:35,380
All right.

1572
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:36,079
See you guys later.

1573
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:44,699
Goodbye.
