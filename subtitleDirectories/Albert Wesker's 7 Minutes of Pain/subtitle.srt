1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,240
Seven minutes. Seven minutes is all I can spare to play with you.

2
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,780
We're up here!

3
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,379
I can't move! I can't do anything!

4
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,819
Can we please just shoot?

5
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,159
Seven minutes.

6
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Dodge! Dodge! X!

7
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
I'm gonna grab those, make sure I get them.

8
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,539
Hold on, I have the poison. Let me just shoot them and...

9
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
I've been kicked.

10
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
I couldn't give him the poison.

11
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Hold X to like...

12
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Hold on. I forget what we have to do here.

13
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,139
Oh, it's a red herb.

14
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,139
What is this? It's broken. Something's broken.

15
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,139
Smash this.

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Alright, this is a giant rifle here.

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
This is legitimately like...

18
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,780
We're not hiding. What do you mean there's no point in hiding?

19
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Alright, I'm about to drop like a fucking nuke right next to you.

20
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,069
I need to get to like a good spot.

21
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,069
He's dancing. He's literally dancing.

22
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,069
I think we can like... Oh no, we can... I remember we can like turn off the lights.

23
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,889
And he's like, ah, where are you? I'm an idiot.

24
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,259
Okay, so we'll come over here.

25
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,259
Are these the lights?

26
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,259
Yeah, it's dark over here. Watch, he's gonna go...

27
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,259
Oh, what the... Oh, I can't... Never mind.

28
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,430
I think I'm dying.

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I think I'm dead. You killed me.

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,000
Saturation.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,759
I'm dead.

32
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,050
You're dead.

33
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,439
I thought that was for you.

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
There is no way we would be able to stand on this lava rock inside the volcano.

35
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
No, what are you talking about? It's probably like a cool, clean, chill 68 degrees right here.

36
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,050
We've got like a high of like 70.

37
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,050
Yeah, it's probably like 60, 70 degrees right now.

38
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,050
It definitely would not be like over 180, like three, five, six hundred thousand degrees.

39
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,909
Why am I on this?

40
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:14,909
I have to make my way around.

41
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:16,910
What the fuck?

42
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Wait, me? What? Hold on.

43
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Climb up. Climb up.

44
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,490
I'm having trouble doing this.

45
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,490
My hands getting tired.

46
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,490
I'm coming.

47
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,490
I have to tap this shit.

48
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
I'm punching this rock.

49
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,180
Oh my god.

50
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
I actually pulled myself.

51
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,180
Oh, you saved yourself?

52
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:52,569
You would never be able to do that in real life.

53
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:53,569
Just one arm, pull yourself up.

54
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,569
Dude, that rock is like 12,000 pounds.

55
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,569
There's no way you'd punch that rock.

56
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,569
I just spit everywhere.

57
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,569
You're like punching a fucking rock, like Rocky Balboa.

58
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,040
What the fuck just happened?

59
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,839
Get over there and start punching the fucking rock.

60
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,269
Here we go. This rock is a hundred times bigger than me.

61
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,959
He's like making his way over to you.

62
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,959
There's no way you're going to do it in time.

63
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,139
He's like right behind you, dude.

64
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,139
You're so dead.

65
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Something tells me we would do it. Something's wrong.

66
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,579
But I'm pretty sure if we walk near him, he's just going to...

67
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,579
This is not good. He's just in the way.

68
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,579
Is there anything we can do? Wait, can you?

69
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,519
I'm going for it. I'm going for it.

70
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,519
He just fell in the lava.

71
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Will you stop swinging at nothing?

72
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

73
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,089
What is this dumbass doing?

74
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,899
Looks like he's painting a mural on the wall.

75
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,899
Oh, God. Oh, here he comes now.

76
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,899
Oh, this is over. This is it.

77
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,899
This is it. This is it. We got to go now.

78
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:37,899
We got to go now. We got to go now.

79
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:46,220
Ready, partner?

80
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Locked and loaded. Suck on this.

81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,910
Yeah, you didn't fire, did you?
