1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,099
Okay, I work out today.

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:14,779
Working out today. How's everybody doing? Good afternoon. I'm running around.

3
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,339
Maybe, maybe ran a little too much.

4
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:28,489
Up and down the stairs. I noticed what time it was. Oh, oh my god. I'm pressing buttons.

5
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,010
I noticed what time it was about

6
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:36,409
Maybe six or seven minutes ago, and I was kind of not ready. So I just had to freak out and I ran around the house.

7
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:41,049
I gotta get coffee. I've got to have something to eat. I've got a pee.

8
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,609
Sometimes you gotta do the other one. Sometimes, not every day, maybe like a few times a week.

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,009
Maybe like once or twice a week. Give me some break. Give me a slack here.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,210
He's very, very constipated.

11
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,450
He cares about his life more than he cares about us. He hates us.

12
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,650
He hates us.

13
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:20,620
This guy had to go to the bathroom. He hates us. Once a week exclusivity.

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,150
You know, that's a good point. Do you guys have

15
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,280
I care. I care. True. He does. No, I don't.

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,859
No, no, I can't. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Like I hold on. Wait a second.

17
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,500
I'm saying he hates this thing, I don't.

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,620
I was referring to he hates us. No, I don't. I just read that, and then I read the accidental next one, which is

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,459
He cares, and then I said no, I don't. Don't worry. Don't worry.

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,810
It was a fucked up slip, whatever they call them.

21
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,299
He cares. No, I don't.

22
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,620
What will this person say?

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,799
Last time I was this early to a Jerma stream,

24
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
I wasn't under audit for evading federal taxes.

25
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,699
Keep it up, Jerma.

26
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,099
Hey, well, hey, your taxes.

27
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,520
What are you doing?

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,479
We're gonna, today we're gonna just chill.

29
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,819
Been kind of in a chill mood recently.

30
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,500
We're gonna, I got a lot of back when we played flash games.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,080
Tons of people said, dude, you gotta get on Nitro.

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,879
I was like, you know what, yeah, I'll check it out.

33
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,120
So we're gonna chill for a little while.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,219
This is not gonna be a long stream.

35
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,360
I have some work to do later

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,560
and I have some things to do later.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,169
I've got a very busy, very busy day, very busy weekend,

38
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,530
very busy everything from here going forward.

39
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,949
Lots of stuff has to be ready for the 31st

40
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,610
and among other things.

41
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,580
So what are you gonna play?

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:00,330
I don't know, I guess what's a good one on Nitro?

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,530
Work in a hundred quotes.

44
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,979
Well, I'll just tell you what the work is.

45
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,229
I'm gonna start making Rumble characters.

46
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,469
That's the plan over the next few days

47
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,389
and next week or so.

48
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:22,639
So, I mean, you could put that into like super quotes,

49
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,060
but there's gonna be a lot of holiday things

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,199
that I'll be doing.

51
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,949
So I have to, I gotta get a lot of stuff done.

52
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,389
I've been putting it off and I'm like, I gotta go, let's go.

53
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,909
By the way, if you haven't done it already,

54
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,580
in the Discord right now,

55
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,780
somebody just called me a fart streamer for three dollars.

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm not supposed to read those,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but it just popped up on the side of my face.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
What was I saying?

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,439
I don't even remember what I was saying.

60
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,879
What was I just saying?

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,960
Discord, right, okay.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,599
So the nominations for the end of the year awards

63
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,060
and the discussions for those things

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,840
are currently happening right now.

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
You've got about another probably two or three days,

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,849
maybe three days or so before that's done

67
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,889
and we start to compile the nominations

68
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,050
and I give you guys something to vote on

69
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,589
for a week and a half.

70
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,550
So if you got nominations for any of those categories,

71
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,589
make sure you go talk about it,

72
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,269
make sure you go nominate them

73
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:31,589
because after this weekend, gonna be closed.

74
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,089
Ah-ee-oo, what's the mystery game?

75
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,639
We've got a lot of mystery games as you can see.

76
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,319
I'm on the website right now.

77
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,079
I don't even have that recorded still, it's gone.

78
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,819
This is available on Switch, PS4, Steam and mobile.

79
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,410
What?

80
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,389
HTML5 games are now here.

81
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,569
Oh, that's good.

82
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,089
So I don't know anything about this website.

83
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:06,550
What's a good one?

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,430
People were like, get on Nitrobe, get on Nitrobe.

85
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,990
You gotta play this, you gotta play that.

86
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,360
Just top games, top games.

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,720
Be Ice Cream, Be Ice Cream 3.

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,339
Okay, Ice Cream apparently is very, very popular.

89
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,930
Why are these so popular?

90
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,250
This is the most popular game ever.

91
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,180
Should I play this one?

92
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,569
I'm gonna play the original Be Ice Cream

93
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:43,019
because this is the top game on the whole website, right?

94
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,920
I got it.

95
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
This is the worst game.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:01,980
How is the worst game the top game?

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,879
Because it is.

98
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,459
Wait, Flash should be on.

99
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,839
I turned it on before the stream.

100
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,680
What the fuck?

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,779
What about Be Ice Cream 2?

102
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,660
Please wait, this stays for more than 10 seconds.

103
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,819
You don't have Flash installed.

104
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,889
Where's the little puzzle piece?

105
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:25,769
Just click it.

106
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,310
I am, click this.

107
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,850
This is gonna take me to get adobeflashplayer.com.

108
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,930
I'm not doing that.

109
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,639
Play a different one, okay.

110
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,970
Not, it says not secure up here.

111
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,470
Just click it.

112
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,319
What, I don't know what's gonna happen.

113
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,279
Oh, okay.

114
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,810
That's, wait, Be Ice Cream 1.

115
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,470
Here we go.

116
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,189
Credit card info.

117
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,629
I don't know, man, I gotta be careful.

118
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,990
I don't wanna click random shit anymore.

119
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,769
That's how you get in trouble.

120
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:10,439
Okay, this is Be Ice Cream.

121
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,600
Can I zoom in?

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,990
Is that, is this good?

123
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,519
You can give me your credit card info.

124
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,540
What do I do?

125
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,500
Is this Be Ice Cream?

126
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,639
Is there any sounds?

127
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,589
Everyone doesn't know that Nitroam's co-developing

128
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,509
a Shovel Knight game.

129
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,899
That's pretty awesome.

130
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,439
What is this stupid shit?

131
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,920
It's a, I don't know, it's a screen saver.

132
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,759
It has to load it.

133
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,319
It's loading the game.

134
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,339
It has to load it, hold on.

135
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,199
What is this shit?

136
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,600
It's a, just relax.

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,350
Refresh the page.

138
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,629
All right, I'm gonna refresh the page.

139
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,620
Here it comes.

140
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,420
Hello, buddy, um, hello?

141
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,560
What?

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,879
Stupid flash shit again, Omega Lo.

143
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,620
Stream the game boards again?

144
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,480
Let's just redo it.

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
All right, come on, let's go.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,870
Be Ice Cream one.

147
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,029
What's going on here?

148
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,120
This is why they're killing Flash.

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,440
It's your Java.

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,399
Be Ice Cream two waiting room.

151
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,759
It's working for me.

152
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, what's going on with me?

153
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,100
Wait, what does it say?

154
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,259
Flash was blocked on this page.

155
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,789
Hold on.

156
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,250
Run.

157
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,730
Run it.

158
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,570
How is it blocked?

159
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,559
It's fucking blocked.

160
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,679
Stop blocking the, stop.

161
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,250
All right, hold on.

162
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,230
Wait, allow it.

163
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,379
Yes, allow.

164
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,559
Fucking bad Ice Cream one.

165
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,059
What the fuck?

166
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,690
How would it be blocked if it's currently showing this?

167
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,690
These tech illiterate.

168
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,419
How much is on a website, man?

169
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,600
I can't even play a game.

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
All right, I'm gonna play,

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,690
I'm gonna click on Twin Shot two, okay?

172
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,399
This is gonna work?

173
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,279
Plug in blocked.

174
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
I have it set to allow.

175
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,710
Why?

176
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,730
But do you know how long it's gonna take

177
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,230
for this Flash shit to,

178
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,710
this is like 100 years of Flash.

179
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,250
It's gonna take,

180
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,690
we're gonna have to get extinct

181
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,690
by the time this is ready to,

182
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,029
okay, here we go.

183
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,049
Humans are gonna get extinct

184
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,340
and then Flash will be finally weeded out.

185
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,100
All right, trick shot two.

186
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,759
Good versus evil.

187
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,220
Why does it look so bad?

188
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,759
Why does it look like this?

189
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,519
Zoom in.

190
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,600
I did.

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,330
Hold on.

192
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,110
This is really loud.

193
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,909
Okay, play.

194
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,490
Select players.

195
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,330
This one.

196
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,220
Press space.

197
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,259
Okay, all right.

198
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,100
I wanna play.

199
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,480
Well, you can't.

200
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,759
All right, can I pick my character?

201
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,399
How about this one, Garfield?

202
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,629
All right, it's arrow keys to space.

203
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,740
Ready.

204
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,360
Good or evil.

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
What should I be?

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,299
Good or evil?

207
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,340
There's a screamer in this.

208
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,600
Well, whatever, I'm gonna get scared.

209
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,230
Evil.

210
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,730
Okay.

211
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,009
Evil level one.

212
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,250
This looks, down below they plot and plan

213
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,610
the next time they will invade us.

214
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,809
This time things are going to be different.

215
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,720
This time we're gonna come in and invade them.

216
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,519
He hates good, I do.

217
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,600
Pretty evil guy.

218
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,399
And break the cycle that has,

219
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,120
just let me play.

220
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,289
This is as loud as hell.

221
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,980
Okay, what do I do?

222
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,840
Oh shit, it's like Bubble Bobble.

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,730
Why am I flying?

224
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,409
I should play Bubble Bobble right now.

225
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,870
How do I play Bubble Bobble?

226
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,950
Where do I get Bubble Bobble?

227
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,200
I wanna play that right now.

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,120
You have wicked bad A.G.A.

229
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,940
Get an N.A.S.

230
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,210
Shit.

231
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,299
What do I play?

232
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,340
Drop the spiky monsters onto the hot rocks.

233
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,179
Okay.

234
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:34,759
Ow.

235
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,960
Fuck this game, fuck this game.

236
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
Stop, it's fine.

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,970
Where do I get Bubble Bobble?

238
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,710
The music too, reminds me of it.

239
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,399
Drop the spiky, how do I do that?

240
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,110
I drop, how do I do this?

241
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,600
Oh.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh sick, that was cool.

243
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,149
How do I get the coins?

244
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,429
This game is a frog dump.

245
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:10,190
No it's not, it's fun.

246
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:18,789
I wanted to play bad ice cream, but it wouldn't load it.

247
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,110
Bubble Bobble, Bubble Bobble, cool math games.

248
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,950
Bubble Bobble.

249
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,429
It's not on cool math games.

250
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

251
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,230
What do you got?

252
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,710
Are you kidding me?

253
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,309
You don't have that right there, do you?

254
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,600
Is that real?

255
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:40,240
Come on, everyone hold on a second.

256
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,669
Oh, calm down.

257
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,629
Holy, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.

258
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,909
I got it, I'm gonna go.

259
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,850
Ow, my ears.

260
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,559
How do I play?

261
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,759
How do I play?

262
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,080
Enter, G, period.

263
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,899
Is it just a, did you just link me to the title screen?

264
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,980
It's just the intro, you just linked me to the intro.

265
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,649
I can't play it?

266
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,929
Why would this exist?

267
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:45,220
Z, why does this exist?

268
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:57,759
Hold on, what did I do wrong?

269
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,799
Press one, okay.

270
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,320
Left and right, control and alt, okay.

271
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,639
It's one.

272
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh my god, here we go.

273
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Dun, dun, dun, A, E, O, O.

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,360
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

275
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
dun, dun, dun, dun, yeah, yeah.

276
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:33,240
That's, I'm doing Peter Griffin, stop.

277
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:41,830
Oh, freaking sweet.

278
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,669
Oh, this is sick.

279
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:43,950
All right, what's the next flash game?

280
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,279
All right, I'm dead.

281
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,730
Move your mouse.

282
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,289
Wait, you can do this, remember you can do this?

283
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,649
Whoever's playing this game, you can do this stuff.

284
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,289
You can like bounce on the bubbles.

285
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:05,529
Yep, I still got it.

286
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,889
Buy the new Bubble Bobble game.

287
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:08,759
I'll buy them all.

288
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,100
There's like 10 of them.

289
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,370
I own them all.

290
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:21,039
Ow, I own Bubble Bobble for the NES.

291
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,159
I own Bubble Bobble, Bust a Move, right?

292
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,039
Bust a Groove, whatever it's called.

293
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,389
The one where it goes, ready, go.

294
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:35,480
I own all those games.

295
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:47,159
E, you should play Toho.

296
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,000
Can I do that?

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,940
Wait, is it, can I, can I do that too?

298
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,299
What should I do?

299
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:57,679
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

300
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,519
This is supposed to be a mystery game stream

301
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,799
and we're just kind of driving down

302
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,950
like the video game highway.

303
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm just pointing at fast food restaurants that go by.

304
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
Oh, but stop at McDonald's.

305
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,309
Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait, we'll see what else is there.

306
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,190
There's Wendy's up there, I can see it.

307
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,359
Uh, yeah, pull in.

308
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,000
No, no, get back on the highway going south.

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,599
I wanna go back to McDonald's.

310
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,960
Wait, is that, is that a, is that a Carl's Jr.?

311
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,799
Oh my God, dude, Carl's Jr.'s on this highway.

312
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:45,339
They got everything.

313
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,809
Dig Dug.

314
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:55,170
No, I don't like Dig Dug, too stressful.

315
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:08,359
No, it's too stressful, it's too stressful.

316
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,200
You suck.

317
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh, I was just standing, all right,

318
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,039
I'm done with this one.

319
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,630
Now, what's the next one?

320
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,789
That was cool to go down memory lane for a little bit.

321
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,819
All right, we're back on Nitrome.

322
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:26,819
Can I try, I wanna play Big Ice Cream.

323
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,630
I'm trying, I'm trying to do Big Ice Cream again.

324
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:37,730
I'm gonna try, or Bad Ice Cream, whatever it is.

325
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,609
Click maps, click maps.

326
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:39,970
All right, well, oh, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,109
I wanna see if it loads.

328
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:52,740
You need to rename this ADHD gaming, Icebreaker or Riot.

329
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,799
Where's Icebreaker?

330
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,640
All right, let's go, hold on.

331
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,289
Let's go back to the main page.

332
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,210
Drop this, you don't see where we are.

333
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:09,319
I don't even know where we are.

334
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,400
Double Night Dig, what's that?

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,599
Okay, should I just browse all games, turn on click maps?

336
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:27,069
Rust Bucket Vault, okay, more games.

337
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:32,339
All games, okay.

338
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:37,220
All right, let's just start right here.

339
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,480
Let's get click maps going.

340
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,170
Let me make sure I have that right, okay.

341
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,230
Okay, you ready?

342
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:58,599
Where are we going, where are we going now?

343
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:04,720
Stretchy Poop.

344
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm not following them on Twitter.

345
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,920
Territory War, Territory War.

346
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,839
We're just gonna scroll down.

347
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,200
All right, so we have Silly Sausage and Meatland.

348
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,490
This looks like what everybody wants, by a lot.

349
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,079
Okay, that's it.

350
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,190
Silly Sausage and Meatland, is this good?

351
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,180
How is this one?

352
00:20:40,180 --> 00:21:00,180
It's very good, okay.

353
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,670
Opera, Opera.

354
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,490
You want me to go get Opera?

355
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,589
I used Opera.

356
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:10,589
Give me another one.

357
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,349
I don't think Opera is even installed

358
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,660
on like two or 3,000 computers.

359
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
Scroll down, all right, well,

360
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,990
what the fuck, can I even play games on here?

361
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,829
Well, I guess we'll go here.

362
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,720
Can I even play games?

363
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:46,640
All right, go ahead.

364
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Use Firefox.

365
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,569
Firefox has problems capturing through OBS for some reason.

366
00:21:51,569 --> 00:22:00,880
I can't, it never works.

367
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,559
Okay, we're gonna try Colorblind.

368
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,640
Can I play a game?

369
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,759
All right, I'm gonna try Colorblind.

370
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,720
Looks like a fun one.

371
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
And I guess it's fun just hanging out.

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,839
We're just chilling.

373
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,839
I like hanging out with you guys.

374
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:20,299
Come on, you don't like hanging out with me?

375
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,410
Use Brave.

376
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:33,190
All right, let's go.

377
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,039
Okay, here it comes.

378
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,440
Initializing, 64%, 73% of that fiber connection.

379
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,720
That's why you get fiber.

380
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,569
That's why you have fiber.

381
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:57,759
Oh, okay.

382
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,079
Right eye versus the dusty pirate clouds

383
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,319
from industrial landscapes.

384
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:07,910
So, I gotta change this a little.

385
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,569
So, is this a good one?

386
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,950
You can see it.

387
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:23,539
Get all this crap off the screen.

388
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,309
All right, let's go.

389
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,250
So, let's play.

390
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:36,799
What's the premise on this one?

391
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,670
Unstretched.

392
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:46,890
I didn't even stretch it that much.

393
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,319
Okay, so I'm in this eyeball

394
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,329
and I'm in a world with no color.

395
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:57,960
Didn't they make a Mickey Mouse game about this?

396
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,160
Okay, so how do I move?

397
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,200
Left, right, and jump.

398
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:12,279
Okay, space.

399
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,599
I feel like I'm playing on a Game Boy.

400
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,279
But that was, all right.

401
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,319
Is this a puzzle game?

402
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,779
How did I fucking lose?

403
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm so mad right now.

404
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,420
How?

405
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,500
I got really angry.

406
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,819
That's the maddest you've heard me

407
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:25,660
in probably like a week.

408
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,960
I got like very mad.

409
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,279
I like, that was mad.

410
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,400
I gotta calm down.

411
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,759
I was so angry.

412
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,839
Okay, you can't jump on them.

413
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,210
Good, here's a note.

414
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,289
I was like just so angry for no reason.

415
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,460
I have red paint.

416
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,740
Okay, so when I have red eye,

417
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,460
I can walk on red material.

418
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,309
Oh, this blue here.

419
00:24:51,309 --> 00:25:01,089
If I have blue paint, I can go on the blue structure.

420
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:02,529
Oh, this is cool.

421
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,650
Oh, I have red and blue eye.

422
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,599
Wait a minute.

423
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,119
How do I get those spikes to turn off?

424
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,380
It'll be nice to see them.

425
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,680
Wait a second, how do I turn the spikes off?

426
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,119
Oh my God, there were blue spikes.

427
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:29,960
I understand, wow.

428
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,599
That was fun.

429
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,799
Age of War, we'll play it.

430
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,319
We got plenty of time.

431
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,519
This game doesn't have any guns.

432
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,849
No, it doesn't.

433
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,890
No, game doesn't have any firearms.

434
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:52,599
I don't wanna even be here.

435
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,680
This is kinda fun.

436
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,630
I actually like this.

437
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,200
This is a good pick.

438
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
He admitted it.

439
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,700
It's cute, it's really cute.

440
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,339
Not every game has to have a machine gun, okay?

441
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,559
And how unrealistic, by the way.

442
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,950
Can we be honest?

443
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,190
Unrealistic, oh yeah.

444
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,029
I'm gonna unload an entire magazine

445
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,150
and just reload it in one second

446
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,829
and then fire another magazine at somebody

447
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:28,750
and reload it and just fire another magazine at somebody.

448
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,960
It doesn't work like that.

449
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,619
Oh shit, what even killed me?

450
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,940
It kinda does.

451
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,759
No, it doesn't.

452
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,210
You fired an entire magazine at somebody.

453
00:26:50,210 --> 00:27:01,039
Like, okay, I'm dying by the tree.

454
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,970
Cloud, it's you dying by the cloud.

455
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:11,759
Oh, okay.

456
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,480
I gotta wake him, I'm good.

457
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,119
This game kinda reminds me of Jump King.

458
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:19,720
Doesn't it remind you guys of Jump King?

459
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,920
You guys love that game.

460
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:31,119
Everybody loves that game.

461
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,799
Icebreaker, moron.

462
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,920
God, what is icebreaker?

463
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,160
Is it good?

464
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,279
All right, let me get to level five.

465
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,599
Play Dolphin Olympics 2, you dipshit.

466
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,440
I don't think you guys,

467
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
I hope you guys don't like order food like this

468
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,599
at like a restaurant or something.

469
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,730
Like, will you guys relax?

470
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,170
Oh yeah, I'll take the Reuben with french fries

471
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,410
and can I get a Coke with that, dipshit?

472
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,700
Sure, sir.

473
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:25,819
What the fuck is your problem?

474
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:27,019
This jack sent me.

475
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,509
You did this joke already, shh.

476
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:34,990
There's a lot of new people here.

477
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:45,609
We gotta use the old material that was like funny.

478
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:46,730
Age of War waiting room.

479
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,740
I promise I'll play Age of War, I promise, I promise.

480
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,299
Oh my goodness, I made it, okay, good.

481
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,160
Oops.

482
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,700
Play Solitaire, I don't know how to play Solitaire.

483
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,299
I can't do that, I don't know how to play Solitaire.

484
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:10,059
No, what do you think about that?

485
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm dead, wait, how do I?

486
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,099
I don't know how to play Solitaire.

487
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:31,220
How do I, I'm gonna need to learn how to play Solitaire.

488
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,180
This is the first level, this is Mario one, two, yep.

489
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,740
Thank you.

490
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,579
All right, good, what does that say?

491
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:51,440
I wanna get to level five, this is fun.

492
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,140
End this bit, it's not landing.

493
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
What bit?

494
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,859
Playing color, the color stream game thing?

495
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:06,180
Playing the color eye color game thing?

496
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,349
There we go, blue.

497
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,910
No guys, I'm not gonna play Solitaire.

498
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,470
I'm not gonna do it.

499
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,390
I'm not going to play Solitaire, I don't know how.

500
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,470
And I'm not gonna sit there

501
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,950
and have you guys teach me how to play Solitaire.

502
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,069
That's not gonna, I'm not, I know I'm doing the thing.

503
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:25,269
I'm saying the words, I know we're doing this.

504
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,309
Like I'm not gonna do that, that's not fun, that's stupid.

505
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:40,019
I'm not gonna do it though, I'm not going to, I promise.

506
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:49,319
Not gonna play Solitaire.

507
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,059
Okay, what's the next one?

508
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,150
Ice cube, the ice cube game?

509
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,750
Oh shit, okay, I'm good.

510
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,150
Age of War, right, I promised everybody

511
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,150
I was gonna play Age of War.

512
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:15,349
I will play Age of War coming up next.

513
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:17,390
This is the last one, I'm gonna beat this.

514
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,180
This game's fun though, I actually like this.

515
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,940
Reminds me of a few different games.

516
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:36,529
Where do I go from here?

517
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:47,619
Oh, oh shit, okay, I get it.

518
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:51,759
It reminds me of a boring game.

519
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,509
No it doesn't, it reminds me of a fun game.

520
00:31:54,509 --> 00:32:01,140
This reminds me of a fun game.

521
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,920
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna reveal

522
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,180
a Jerma Rumble character for you

523
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,539
because I know people just keep asking,

524
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:09,339
they keep talking about it and I'm gonna address it, okay.

525
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:11,700
So one of the new characters in Jerma Rumble

526
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,339
next coming up is, I'm dead.

527
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,299
One of the, okay, I gotta stop for a second.

528
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,500
I can't do two things at once.

529
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,099
My brain can only focus on one thing at a time.

530
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,509
Okay, Jerma's ass is gonna be a,

531
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:36,109
oh my fucking God, I'm not gonna move.

532
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:44,920
Jerma's ass is going to be a character, there you go.

533
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:52,440
Now let's see if I can beat this.

534
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,819
Ass by itself, yes.

535
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:05,579
So let's see how, I hope you guys root for it.

536
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:08,259
Oh shit, I got it.

537
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,779
Will there be 2019 characters in it too?

538
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,869
Yes.

539
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:13,950
There's like two years worth of people to pull from

540
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,990
so this is gonna, that's why I,

541
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,309
what's the next one, Age of War?

542
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:27,690
How do I get there, is it on here?

543
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,690
Age of War, where do I get it?

544
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,789
Oh, here we go, okay, I got it.

545
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:40,660
Addicting Games, this is the one, right?

546
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,180
This is Age of War.

547
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:58,390
I'll do Dolphin Olympics after this, I promise.

548
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,029
Max Games, oh shit, yeah.

549
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:06,880
That is old, that's really old.

550
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,059
MaxGames.com.

551
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,059
I heard, I don't think that was allowed for you

552
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,199
but whatever, okay.

553
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,539
Instructions.

554
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:23,739
Goal of the game is to survive and destroy the enemy base.

555
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,920
The game is divided in five ages.

556
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,690
With the next age, you need XP points.

557
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,050
To gain these points, you have to kill enemy units, okay?

558
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,230
You can also gain XP points

559
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,010
when one of your units is killed.

560
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,969
You can also build defenses.

561
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:43,460
Finding the balance between defense and offense is the key.

562
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,599
Wait, is it intentional, what?

563
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,489
What did I do?

564
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,780
You'll also be able to use a special attack.

565
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,639
This attack will, what did I do?

566
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,000
This attack will need time to be available again

567
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
after you use it.

568
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,300
Each age has its own special attack, sure.

569
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,179
You cannot repair your base but it will gain health points

570
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,420
every time you evolve to the next age.

571
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,929
Protect your base at all costs.

572
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:18,260
Okay, like, 1998 flash games are the same thing

573
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,510
as 1998 video games.

574
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,110
They're insanely hard.

575
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,909
And if I do impossible, it's actually impossible

576
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,800
and you can't win.

577
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,280
Your volume is down?

578
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:39,480
No, it's not, it's not.

579
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,510
I'm doing normal.

580
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:47,329
All right, here we go.

581
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,780
What do I do?

582
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,119
Train units menu.

583
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,719
15 for a club man.

584
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:59,159
Oh, shit, get out there, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

585
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,659
Slingshot man.

586
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,579
Oh, yes, this is gonna be so much fun.

587
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,400
And then I can also do dino rider.

588
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,920
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

589
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,219
Get more people out there.

590
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:20,170
Build turrets.

591
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,460
Okay, rock slingshot.

592
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,980
Let's go, yeah, build it.

593
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:37,019
It's one of these games, I love these.

594
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,980
Get up there, get up there, get up there, get up there.

595
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,820
I need a dino rider.

596
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,659
I need a dino rider.

597
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,059
We're losing, we're losing, we're losing.

598
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,940
Dino rider, go up.

599
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,849
Slingshot.

600
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,190
Only slingshot behind the dino rider.

601
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:03,030
DMCA, is it?

602
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,050
Here we go.

603
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,289
Yes, yes, yes, keep going.

604
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,449
I want another dino rider.

605
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:09,289
Want to help the CF?

606
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,110
He's dead, all right.

607
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,969
Another one, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

608
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:20,849
Okay, I can queue him up.

609
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,369
Oh, fuck.

610
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:23,769
Oh my god, what?

611
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,920
No, dude, that's so many.

612
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,659
Use your special, what does it do?

613
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,500
Does it hurt me?

614
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,059
Oh, wow, that's powerful.

615
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,679
Wow, that's powerful.

616
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,260
That's incredibly powerful.

617
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,059
Okay, go back.

618
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,860
Just make five dino riders.

619
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,420
Get in there.

620
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,869
Get in there, get in there, get in there, go, go, go, go, go.

621
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh, fuck.

622
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,670
What?

623
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,750
What, how did he get that?

624
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,900
How do I do that?

625
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,860
Add a turret spot.

626
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,539
How do I do that?

627
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,659
I only have dinosaurs.

628
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,139
It's the star, where?

629
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,139
Evolve, 4,000.

630
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:25,219
Fuck, I'm behind.

631
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,059
All right, we're okay.

632
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:26,880
We're all right.

633
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,110
I kept up.

634
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,389
I need an archer.

635
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,690
This is actually gonna work out fine, we're good.

636
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,530
Another archer.

637
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,530
Can I make a knight?

638
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,369
500 bucks.

639
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,250
Okay, we're good.

640
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,670
How much experience do I need?

641
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,510
1,400, all right, I'll get that before him.

642
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,869
Don't use your special.

643
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:52,710
What about a turret?

644
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,349
Okay, sell a turret.

645
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:58,300
Buy a turret, add a turret spot.

646
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,739
Catapult, it's 500, should I get it?

647
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:09,139
Fire catapult, sell this one.

648
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,920
Sell, okay.

649
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,139
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

650
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:17,269
I gotta get in there.

651
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,710
All right, turret.

652
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,710
I'm gonna go with a catapult, let's go.

653
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,630
Done.

654
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,909
Eat box remix, okay.

655
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:34,889
All right, I couldn't do it.

656
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:41,789
My throat is fucked up still, I can't do it.

657
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:44,360
Give me a horse.

658
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,440
All right, go in there with the guns.

659
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,539
Use the shotgun.

660
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,409
Shotgun in the head.

661
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,969
Violence, finally, people are waking up

662
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:59,719
and paying attention, violence.

663
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,719
I need one of those.

664
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,050
Experience, I need 14,000.

665
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,010
All right, let's go, go, go, go, go.

666
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,949
Horse, horse, horse, horse, horse.

667
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,360
Two horses back to back.

668
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,179
Use special.

669
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,380
Double horse coming in.

670
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,260
He upgraded, he upgraded, he upgraded.

671
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,860
Sorry, he can't take me, he can't take me.

672
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,500
He upgraded an age.

673
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,289
I need 14, all right, go, go, go, go, upgrade.

674
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,409
Dueler, a duelist.

675
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:40,760
Oh shit, he's like just running me through.

676
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,519
Cannoneer, you're fucked.

677
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,280
No, I'm not, I'm not dead yet.

678
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,920
Wait till I, I'm gonna get a cannoneer.

679
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,409
Oh god, I'm in trouble.

680
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,210
Is this a heal?

681
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,079
Oh no, no, no, no, no, I thought it was gonna be a bomb.

682
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,760
It's not over, it's not over.

683
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,849
I've got a cannoneer.

684
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,219
What, shocking in the head.

685
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:10,909
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

686
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:15,340
Another one, he's dead, fuck.

687
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,219
I need another turret, I need a turret spot.

688
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:25,780
Shit, they've got cannons, I'll need a large cannon.

689
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,539
Use this again, I need a cannon.

690
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,900
Quick, get a cannon, get a cannon, get a cannon, 1500.

691
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,980
Sell all this, give me the cannon, large cannon.

692
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,429
All right, you're fucked now.

693
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,110
How much experience do I need?

694
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,949
45,000.

695
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:52,539
Losing in a kid's game.

696
00:41:52,539 --> 00:42:00,699
Holy shit, how does he have all that stuff?

697
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:05,559
We're gonna get in there.

698
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,929
Get in, evolve, evolve.

699
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:11,409
I don't have enough.

700
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,690
Add a turret spot, that's what we're doing.

701
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,530
Smash up.

702
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:17,489
This game's sick.

703
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,360
Okay, I have another turret spot, a little turret.

704
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,079
How about a, let's get a small, no, no, no, small cannon,

705
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,519
yeah, I need to upgrade.

706
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:33,360
Maybe just two mediums?

707
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,800
Fuck, I have no money.

708
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,199
I have to evolve to 42, 45.

709
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,550
Gonna do it quick, he's already ahead of me.

710
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,889
Shit, I'm in trouble, go.

711
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:54,500
Special, how much is a tank?

712
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,159
Seven, get a fucking tank out right now.

713
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,480
Tank, tank, tank, tank, get a tank.

714
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:04,710
Okay, sell this.

715
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,079
Little turret.

716
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,719
Oh, you're in trouble.

717
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,679
Rocket turret, how about a, okay.

718
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,559
Yeah, I got a tank.

719
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,559
Shit, they killed him, tank.

720
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,099
My computer crashed.

721
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:32,829
Hello?

722
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:35,699
What?

723
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:41,550
I was having so much fun.

724
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,389
Oh, come on.

725
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:51,750
My graphics card can't handle an explosion in a flash game

726
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,670
from 25 fucking years ago?

727
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:07,199
Hold on, can I, let me just force this to quit.

728
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,199
All right, hold on, coming back.

729
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,820
What the fuck, that's so annoying.

730
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,659
Hold on.

731
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,809
Turn the music off, extras.

732
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:29,489
Here's a sweet drawing I made.

733
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,690
I mean, it is pretty sweet.

734
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:43,690
That's pretty sweet, it is.

735
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:50,010
Oh, I know what to do now.

736
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,170
All right, it's about kill.

737
00:44:53,170 --> 00:45:02,139
Get us in there quick, I'm gonna win the first stage.

738
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:04,139
It's a, yeah, I'm rushing to start.

739
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,519

740
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,599

741
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:12,860
All right, what do I need?

742
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,460
I need 4,000 sprints.

743
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,619
He wasted money on a slingshot, what an idiot.

744
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:20,460
Big mistake.

745
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:34,840
Again, do it again, it's a Dino.

746
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:41,710
AI gets unlimited money, do they really?

747
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,090
Oh, I've gotta push back really far.

748
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,929
Little turret, idiot.

749
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:47,530
I don't need a turret until the next stage.

750
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:58,739
He's not gonna even get past here, what?

751
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:04,739
4,000, he's still in a line.

752
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,769
All right, now I'm gonna save a little bit of money.

753
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,170
I'm gonna build a second turret swap.

754
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,699
That's way too much, hold on.

755
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:18,420
Do the special, there's nobody gonna do it to him.

756
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,010
Okay, Dino, Dino.

757
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,739
Oh, all right, all right, okay.

758
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,980
I don't wanna waste any money.

759
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,860
Evolve, I can't evolve yet, it's 4,000.

760
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,340
And special, go.

761
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,340
All-sling shot.

762
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:07,179
What are you spamming?

763
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:09,500
I've been in touch with Healy and he said,

764
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,699

765
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,940
if you screen more solitaire flash cams.

766
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,579
He said your content is funny and random

767
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,820
and a family guy sort of way and he sort of

768
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,059
needed a good representative for the solitaire community

769
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,059
going forward, something to think about.

770
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:28,230
Oh, fuck yeah, how did he already evolve?

00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,619
How much is the horse?

772
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:44,900
All right, I need a turret.

773
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,199

774
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,199
I'm gonna hold off.

775
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:52,800
Hopefully I can make the money.

776
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:11,659
Kill, shit, do it, kill him.

00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,219

Okay, I'm gonna put another super cannon in here how are we ever gonna do this neither one of us can fight each other

863
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:58,900
Just farm them. I guess

864
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:26,849
Don't use special unit till later. I hold on I need to get

865
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,590

866
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:43,010
So how much money do I need to win?

867
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:54,780

868
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,179

869
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,309
Okay, I can make almost two

870
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:43,300

871
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,019

872
00:59:46,460 --> 01:00:00,699
Hello place the red turret. I don't think I even need to okay. I'm going for it two big tanks

873
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,179
Two super soldiers

874
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:05,489
It should be enough

875
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:22,909
There we go. I don't have another super soldier cute up it in there

876
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,909

01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,940
This is I feel like I'm playing a game of Starcraft

879
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,369
We both is 1v1 and we both own

880
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:55,230
50% of the entire fucking map each we have thousands of units at some point. Do you just call a truce?

881
01:00:55,909 --> 01:01:06,550
Like after like four or five hours when it's like the game balance makes it impossible for anyone to win

882
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,909
The only way you win in a game like that in Starcraft or Warcraft

883
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:16,300
Is if something like up somebody's parents called them because they're like concerned because it's been like four hours

884
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,500
You know what I mean? Like like like Dave David

885
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:26,380
Mom, what do you that's all takes that time? That's the amount of times it's over. You lost when that happens

886
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:35,840
That's how you decide so I'm just gonna spam God's blades

887
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,519
Just make a million basic units, okay, whatever I'll try it

888
01:01:55,469 --> 01:02:01,380
This is feeding the feeding

889
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:08,610
It's not a good plan

890
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,469
So just what it feels like to be lane minions

891
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:23,130
There's two giant fucking structures too huge. But wait, why are they damaged?

892
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:28,659
How did I do that damage?

893
01:02:28,659 --> 01:02:31,039
All right. I'm going in with super soldiers only

894
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:53,590
Your towers are killing him. How how the fuck is that happening? It's overshooting people sometimes

895
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,250
tanks only tanks

896
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:19,070
There must sell the ions and use the cash for soldiers. No, that's not gonna keep me alive. We're just waiting

897
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:22,730
Just waiting to kill each other

01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:33,570

What the fuck just let him die. I'm just gonna farm to like five million gold

901
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:50,960
Now by the super soldiers, I can only get one

902
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,739
Idiot can't even win a kid's game. This is our kids game

903
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,980
You may have played it when you were a kid, but it wasn't made for you

904
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:22,809
Quick evolve to solitaire. No, that's not yet. I have to win. Tell me he's almost dead

905
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:26,969
Holy crap sell the red one

906
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,329

907
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:42,269
You go happy. I don't know. I did that. It was available

908
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:49,920
Just open up another game in a different window and come back in like a half an hour

909
01:04:50,440 --> 01:05:04,980
All right. What's next? I'll just mute this. What's the next one? Are we going after this?

910
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:12,559

912
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:36,369
Give me a sec. Okay. I need age of war 2. I think I broke it

913
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:54,559
Wait a minute. That's not gonna work. It freezes. How's it? Yeah. No, I can't it freezes like raft wars

914
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:03,940
If it's not the active window, it won't do it

915
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,559
Oh

916
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:21,159

Enemy enemy. I feel like I write like that. So what am I? I can't make fun of it

930
01:07:50,889 --> 01:07:59,940
I've spelled enemy like that with last week. All right, what's next? We're going to raft wars

931
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:09,869
Is that on addicting games or I said we're playing nitrome and I didn't even play one game on nitrome

932
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
Raft wars. Sure. Let's get it

Good news soon found its way into the papers

940
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:28,029
The treasure is mine

941
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:31,920
Time to team up with your brother and defend what's rightfully yours

942
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:40,239
Go level one par six shots. I'm gonna make this a little bigger for you guys

01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:49,199
Okay mouse click to begin. What do you do?

01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:58,090
Instructions but you have to get power and then fire

945
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:07,689
Those pyres are toast. Well, that was in this

946
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:10,409
That's one of these games. Okay

947
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:17,470
It's angry birds. It's angry birds that you can't see. All right, hold on. What if I just go?

948
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:24,800

Yeah, ain't got nothing. Yeah headshot. Oh

01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:42,659

Too close too close too close. You're dead

952
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:49,199
That's a fucking off-the-wall

953
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:53,779
Tell you later

954
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:57,619

Upgrade the raft. Okay. Yeah, I'm good. I'm pretty good with tennis ball shot

960
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:23,359
Par six is just a guy up on the hill. Okay. I think I got this

961
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,260
Watch this guy in the hills done. Oh

01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:36,409
That's gonna hit right in the head. Sorry. He's not as good

963
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,180
Right in the tummy

964
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:50,279
The axe is probably good. Oh, what's that right in the head?

965
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,520
What are these babies saying? Oh

966
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:02,130
We're okay. We're okay a

967
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:11,050
Headshot only does 81

968
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,239
Headshot again get out of here

969
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:32,029
Only one more. What's the par? I think I only one more shot. He's done

970
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:43,010
Is it par six credits earned? I did it right shots fired. Yeah, I got it

971
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:52,010
Okay, buy missile or buy grenade. I'm gonna buy a grenade two grenades and one rocket

972
01:12:52,930 --> 01:13:05,520
Level three guy on a jet ski. Okay, can't do the thing. I was doing before we're gonna go like this and

973
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:08,039
That's gonna miss. It's okay

974
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:29,909
You got to go over the hippo fuck. There it is right there. Oh

975
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:38,729
No, I can't otherwise they're shooting a real gun the dog no the dog

976
01:13:44,640 --> 01:14:01,670
Fuck damn it. I said every spot, but you're both

977
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:25,289
There we go. Yeah, it looks like they look like like South Park character. What the fuck was that dude? What the hell was that?

978
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:31,050
Go full power. I can't I'll shoot the bug. I'll hit the hippo in the face. Oh, that was bad

979
01:14:31,529 --> 01:14:33,930
This might be a loss. This is a loss

980
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:40,039
Way too fucking much. Come on right the guy's jet ski

981
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
God don't ever buy those

982
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:54,399
Stop using moving your mouse between shots

983
01:14:57,689 --> 01:15:02,090
Baby

984
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,090
No, the baby could hit the head by like a metal slug

985
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:20,319
Get him off that. Oh, that's it game over. I already lost the par

986
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:44,770
What the fuck was that? I didn't move my mouse. Oh you bad. This is hard. It's intelligent

987
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:45,970
Easy

988
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:47,689
It's not easy

989
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:54,729
There it is. I

990
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:59,510
Beat this when I was eight. I'm sure you did

991
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:06,829
No, what happened is which you miss remembering things in the computer lab when you were like fucking 13

992
01:16:06,869 --> 01:16:18,220
You played this for like five minutes and then the teacher came over and said

993
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:24,180
you kind of what you're trying to gauge how long was gonna take for the teacher to go around the computer room and

994
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,100
Come over and put the hand over on the desk and lean over and look at what you were doing to see how good your

995
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,180
Work was doing

996
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,789
You timed it, you know

997
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:36,069
It was about four or five minutes from when they were in the corner of the room

998
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:43,899
They went and checked on every single person you timed it a few times. It was about four and a half minutes right there

999
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:57,800
That's gonna hit me around the head. Thank God. There it is bounce

1000
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,489
Okay, but I actually beat it when I was eight

1001
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,819
Oh

1002
01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:10,630
Stupid all right, let's do it again. Oh

1003
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:18,079
All right, it's a par five. Come on. I can do this. It's not even that bad

1004
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,319
It's got to go slightly over the hippos head. Let's try this ready

1005
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:30,050
There it is. Okay, right after that got one guy dead. That's a good link. Hold on

1006
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,800
single

1007
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,829
He was actually pretending. No, I was afraid of hitting the hippo

1008
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:53,770
Oh

1009
01:17:53,770 --> 01:18:09,979
Click the link. All right. Hold on. That's a six out of ten link. All right. Well, we'll find out

1010
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,760
Yeah, this is a six out of ten, but it's still all right

1011
01:18:17,479 --> 01:18:23,920
It's all right. It's not bad. I would call this a quality six. I

1012
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:50,310
Still can't believe you guys hit me right in the face. I got really didn't even move. That was just stupid. I was just yeah

1013
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,189
That's so ridiculous. Whatever. All right, let's go

1014
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,229
level four seven shots

1015
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:04,000
There's a guy in the dock in the raft got a jet ski. Oh, this would be easy. Okay, here we go

1016
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:12,710
See ya I stepped into it. I know I didn't step into it

1017
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:31,649
Fuck it's gonna hit him. I want up three. Oh, it was a baseball

1018
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,310
Fuck I'm doing

1019
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:41,909
There I'm eating a sandwich. Do you want half of the dams? What?

1020
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,359
Are you talking about?

1021
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:52,079
Yep, that was the strategy

1022
01:19:52,640 --> 01:20:05,520
All right, I like going hard and just shooting

1023
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:19,050
There was dead. I really want oh, I just gotta hit it a

1024
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:26,850
Little bit higher right there. That's it. No

1025
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:29,170
Come on

He missed again, sorry

1030
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:58,060
That was more than seven shots though, yeah, damn it

1031
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,350
All right coming up

1032
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,520
Is that more than seven shots?

1033
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:15,380
This is five shots. It's not moving the mouse. No, that doesn't help. That's like they can't come back and kill us, right?

1034
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:24,920
Oh, that was a triple

1035
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,300

1036
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,989
All right, what's up after this? What's the next one?

No idea

1050
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:24,390

1132
01:36:48,880 --> 01:37:08,779
They keep moving me around they bounce me around and my shots are wrong. Okay, that's that's too. This guy's dead. All right

1133
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:24,770
We're fine. Just as long as he doesn't kill us right now. Okay. Well, it was probably inevitable

1134
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:31,079
I have to take care of this guy first. I got it exactly in the right spot that I want it

01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:03,000
Got a bowl knock him in the water. Oh, come on. That would have been sick. There are nine people playing evolved right now

1139
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:10,640

1140
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,170

01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:21,069

Good good. Now they're gonna be in a bad spot here. Same deal bone

1150
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:20,859
It's gonna be up a little bit higher. They're gonna miss he's gonna overshoot the whole thing under

1151
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:32,189
It's okay. Why is that instantly? It kills you instantly. This is gonna be

1152
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,560

1155
01:39:58,989 --> 01:40:01,329
Alright, I this is doable. They don't hit me

01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:51,340
They have huge splash damage grenades and I have three characters. They have four even if I kill three people in three hits

1168
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,539
I'm dead

It's not fair

1180
01:43:56,029 --> 01:44:08,119
Not in a bad fit. Okay, this is where we potentially went. I've got to knock this fucking guy off

1181
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:10,680
Don't kill us both

1182
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:14,479

Thank you very much. He's dead. Now. It's gonna deal with the guy up top

1185
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:26,119
We have never seen the guy up top fire a weapon. He might miss

1186
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:31,529
He's gonna miss he missed as it does it seven damn. We're fine

1187

1189
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:46,920
Way over way over that's not gonna be seven damage. I'm gonna be fine

1192
01:45:12,819 --> 01:45:18,489

Like I can't believe I lost

1196
01:45:49,699 --> 01:45:52,500
I'm not moving at all. I'm staying completely still

1197
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,310
Just kill me. It's a wash. I'm doing it again

1198
01:45:55,949 --> 01:46:11,810
Just remember the background. I should have won that last one, but it was just there's too far. I

1199
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:16,020
Gotta kill the guy up top first. He's the biggest pain in the ass

1200
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:24,760

02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:56,470
Not even like a hey just want to let you know, you know

1359
02:05:56,470 --> 02:06:00,710
What was the last time somebody wrote in quotes like hey just want to let you know

1360
02:06:00,829 --> 02:06:09,289
Like the glider is really good not in all capitals get this thing stupid person

1361
02:06:09,850 --> 02:06:14,390
and by the way, I

1362
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:27,149
But it's my game. What if I want to do what I want to do. I'll get the kite. I go any any further

1363
02:06:27,829 --> 02:06:29,550
What fuel?

1364
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:32,300
And I'll get it. I can afford it

1365
02:06:32,539 --> 02:06:44,979
Am I flying? Oh, all right. It's working pretty well fly

1366
02:06:45,699 --> 02:06:48,510
Did I get more distance?

1367
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:53,720
24, okay

1368
02:06:53,720 --> 02:07:09,029
Same saving it. I'm gonna save money. I got to kill the snowman. All right, stay like this. I was awful

1369
02:07:09,029 --> 02:07:10,350
Why was it so bad?

1370
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:26,899
Use the boost. Hold on. Look at that. Look at that top speed. Oh

1371
02:07:27,979 --> 02:07:29,539
Wait, I can fly

1372
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:36,359
Does it work like Mario and Mario 3 or Super Mario World where you go like?

1373
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:40,699
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Is that how it worked?

1374
02:07:41,140 --> 02:08:06,260
All right. Okay. Let me see kind of a new record for altitude. All right boost

1375
02:08:06,819 --> 02:08:09,189
Pellar okay, I have a propeller

1376
02:08:09,829 --> 02:08:12,829
And then a payload is power sand

1377
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:21,060
All right, let's go. What's the button for um, you have a boost use it with spacebar

1378
02:08:21,579 --> 02:08:23,760
Each glider has a red zone

1379
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:29,699
Flying faster than a glider max speed will increase wind resistance meaning you won't go as far if you go too fast

1380
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:59,329
Okay. Oh cool. This is so fun. I got duration. I'm gonna go again. Let's go. You have to destroy obstacles, okay?

1381
02:09:02,619 --> 02:09:22,119
Forty-seven forty-six forty-five forty-four. All right, that's that's first I've ever gone. It's not okay close. Oh shit. I got a medal

1382
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:25,869
all right, how about um booster fuel and

1383
02:09:26,789 --> 02:09:28,430
That's all I can do

1384
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:40,970
That looks pretty good. That looks like good speed good speed

1385
02:09:41,489 --> 02:10:06,039
Good play sonic inflation adventure. I don't know if that is good speed right off the bat. All right, stay right there

1386
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:13,420
I'm just gonna float a little bit. Where is he? He's close. All right, that's good. We're getting progress

1387
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:22,239
114 all right, I need more um about I need a ramp height and

1388
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:27,060
Maybe none of these 125 plank to

1389
02:10:27,779 --> 02:10:30,020
Nice, I got it. This is extra speed

1390
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:48,029
Yeah, that was good. There he is. All right, I gotta hey, I gotta kill him. I got a hit

1391
02:10:48,609 --> 02:10:59,060
Alright, I'm gonna save the money. Maybe what about another thruster?

1392
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:18,789
Okay, I need $250 for that we're gonna do power our iron pellets. Come on get them

1393
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:31,789
Command you to rise from the snow and fly what what the fuck just happened

1394
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:42,369
What where is he? Where's the snowman? Is he dead? Wait, what?

1395
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:56,500
The arrow was pointing down here. Didn't have to kill the snowman. You wasted it, but I thought I had to destroy the snowman

1396
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:15,819
Pulse jet you wasted it. I what I thought I thought I had to kill snowman

1397
02:12:16,399 --> 02:12:32,329
There it is done

1398
02:12:32,329 --> 02:12:37,909
Destruction 75 bucks. This is so much fun. I love this

1399
02:12:38,789 --> 02:12:42,539
Bonus shop. Oh what you're looking for

1400

Earn more bonus points by earning medals playing arcade mode or completing story or classic

1402
02:12:51,479 --> 02:12:55,920
You like to have more days in a month. This calendar starts on day zero

1403
02:12:59,979 --> 02:13:01,539
Nobody gets rich by earning their money

1404
02:13:01,539 --> 02:13:06,960
The real way to make the big bucks is knowing how to make more from what you got 5% more cash every run

1405
02:13:07,699 --> 02:13:11,390
I'll remove the

1406
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:15,069
Genuine Phoenix feather this will reduce the speed loss when flying by 10%

1407
02:13:15,949 --> 02:13:31,600
Okay, whose deficiency booster 5% more power. I guess I'm just gonna look at the money one. I can do it again

1408
02:13:32,359 --> 02:13:40,380
Holy shit. Okay. Um, I guess I'll do the speed loss to the money money and speed loss temperature money

1409
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:44,199
Okay, and let's go

1410
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:48,539
All right. I have to destroy the snow mound wherever that is

1411
02:13:51,220 --> 02:14:25,109

1412
02:14:25,909 --> 02:14:31,340
That was good distance

1413
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:54,390
154 old glider. Okay, I'll do this one. Whoa. Oh my god. I'm just going I'm just going man

1414
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:57,189

1456
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:31,729
What does it say?

1457
02:21:31,729 --> 02:21:33,090
VPN

1458
02:21:33,090 --> 02:21:35,090
Saves the day again

1459
02:21:35,889 --> 02:21:50,020
VPN saves the day again. Oh, oh my god and have it twice. Oh, it's wonderful

Oh my god

1462
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:19,049
Thank God for the VPN. Yes, we're good

1482
02:25:41,149 --> 02:26:06,920
Okay, I need to destroy the wall. I'm gonna glide for a little bit. I want distance

1483
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:11,139
All right, we're gonna go over that. I cleared that

1484
02:26:11,579 --> 02:26:14,139
Out of fuel, but it's okay

1485
02:26:14,219 --> 02:26:31,219
What's in front the wall? Stop stalling. What I'm trying to stay in the trying to get the distance award

1486
02:26:31,219 --> 02:26:33,219
Yeah, look at distance duration three

1487
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:50,930
How much have you been lost? I would need it a plank about good old sled

1488
02:26:52,270 --> 02:26:55,079
Or how about wait L bouncy?

1489
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:09,909

02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:54,280
10% reduction of the drag effect with red zones. Yeah

1502
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:59,680
That's gravity

1503
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:05,920
fuel capacity see how far you've traveled. Oh, it's a little

Cool, thanks boss. Remember it runs out of fuel quickly Barry because it's heavy. It'll smash through every glass everywhere

1827
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:26,860
This is the wrecking ball with the mouse pointer click to begin. You have a limited amount of time to use the wrecking ball

1828
03:34:26,860 --> 03:34:49,190
So get swinging

1829
03:34:55,989 --> 03:34:57,430
There

1830
03:34:57,430 --> 03:35:00,500
You killing me

1831
03:35:00,739 --> 03:35:18,299
It moves around way too fast. I got it. All right. I got it. All right next little

1832
03:35:19,340 --> 03:35:25,739
What Barry look what is it boss? Oh, ah, sorry guys

1833
03:35:25,739 --> 03:35:29,940
I can't get down. We have no time for this. Get your silly brother to the floor without injuring them

1834
03:35:31,020 --> 03:36:23,500
Should I actually kill them? All right, so hold on. Oh, wait, wait, he's okay

1835
03:36:27,329 --> 03:36:51,809
He's not he's almost on the floor. Hold on. I don't I don't like these kind of games

1836
03:36:52,370 --> 03:37:25,219
Because I've found a missile launcher and then finds a lot of things. Yeah, I'm gonna lose my brain

1837
03:37:25,219 --> 03:37:28,180
I just want to sprint as fast as I can into a wall and smash my head into it. I

1838
03:37:29,059 --> 03:37:30,100
mean I

1839
03:37:30,100 --> 03:37:35,260
Do puzzles and like figure out what to like what like pillow did no no no head down run as fast

1840
03:37:35,260 --> 03:37:37,260
I can and head into wall break through the wall

1841
03:37:37,579 --> 03:37:43,940
Okay, position the launcher with mouse pointer

1842
03:37:44,540 --> 03:37:48,819
To place the vehicle then click again to launch missile steer the missile with the mouse

1843
03:37:49,700 --> 03:38:11,670
Okay, that's fun. I like that part. Oh shit. It already went like metal here solid

1844
03:38:11,670 --> 03:38:21,219
I like that one. That was fun because I was just putting my head down and running into a wall as far as I can and

1845
03:38:21,219 --> 03:38:22,739
exploding it

1846
03:38:22,739 --> 03:38:25,950
And the shitty music off that's not that what?

1847
03:38:28,229 --> 03:38:41,829
I'll let any debris hit the that's what they meant. Okay, you guys don't like that

1848
03:38:44,389 --> 03:38:57,879
Don't don't

1849
03:38:59,920 --> 03:39:06,829
It's complete right? Yeah, okay

1850
03:39:06,989 --> 03:39:14,909
Cousin Ivan found a plane. It can destroy a lot of stuff quickly. You don't blow me up, bruv

1851
03:39:16,030 --> 03:39:18,030
Hmm, I'll help push stuff around with a helicopter

1852
03:39:18,670 --> 03:39:21,469
Okay, but Gary you can only bomb stuff in the yellow barriers

1853
03:39:22,110 --> 03:39:24,110
Yes, and I guess you should get

1854
03:39:24,670 --> 03:39:26,549
Gary down from there

1855
03:39:26,549 --> 03:39:39,809
He's British

1856
03:39:39,809 --> 03:39:47,680
Watch out watch out watch out watch out

1857
03:39:47,680 --> 03:40:10,450
Watch out Larry Larry Larry Larry. You're fine. All right, he's gonna come he's gonna come down nice and softly

1858
03:40:11,129 --> 03:40:16,780
Okay. Now. I just need a wrecking ball

1859
03:40:19,030 --> 03:40:21,030
only

1860
03:40:22,809 --> 03:40:26,729
Damn it. I knew I was gonna do that. Damn it. I don't like this

1861
03:40:27,489 --> 03:40:30,750
Give me another one. Give me another one. Give me another one

1862
03:40:31,629 --> 03:40:57,850
Save him. I thought he was gonna say fuck had ice cream three. I tried to play that earlier

1863
03:40:57,850 --> 03:41:12,360
I couldn't get it to work. Just trying to kill him one more time. Yeah, I'm done with this one. I

1864
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:17,500
Don't usually don't like to play these kinds of games. They're like they're cute and they're fun, but now enough for me

1865
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:18,659
What's next?

1866
03:41:18,659 --> 03:41:20,659
mother load mother load

1867
03:41:22,139 --> 03:41:29,370
Other load

1868
03:41:29,489 --> 03:41:39,989
Flash game it also a nitro. Okay enable flash

1869
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:48,370
Alright, this is a tiny fucking window. I like full screen this

1870
03:41:49,209 --> 03:41:53,049
This is so small

1871
03:41:53,129 --> 03:42:09,989
Mother load with a little gold edition back when monitors had 640 by 480 resolution

1872
03:42:10,030 --> 03:42:27,750
Okay, you need to move this that looks good. Alright, what is this game the full screen button?

1873
03:42:29,190 --> 03:42:39,459
Mini clip says switch to focus mode to concentrate. This will restart your game. Okay full screen mode. They work

1874
03:42:39,459 --> 03:42:44,930
I mean it sort of worked

1875
03:42:50,229 --> 03:42:59,719
Little better exactly the same though. How's this one? Is this game good?

1876
03:43:00,280 --> 03:43:14,729
Meet and fuck I'm not gonna play meet and fuck adventure. I'm gonna get you. I will be removed from this platform

1877
03:43:14,930 --> 03:43:23,180
I'm not gonna play that control your pod using the arrow keys, or if it's more comfortable the WASD

1878
03:43:23,180 --> 03:43:27,430
Okay, your drill deploys automatically if you move into diggable material

1879
03:43:27,510 --> 03:43:36,159
You cannot drill straight up you can trade minerals in your storage bay for cold hard cash. Oh, I think I'm gonna like this

1880
03:43:36,319 --> 03:43:38,559
Let's go

1881
03:43:45,790 --> 03:43:47,149
Transmission

1882
03:43:47,149 --> 03:43:51,629
We forgot to refuel you on the way over drive over to the fuel station and fill her up

1883
03:43:52,149 --> 03:43:58,440
But almost impossible to hire decent miners on Mars since all the strange activities started happening around here

1884
03:43:58,639 --> 03:44:01,399
That's why we're willing to pay you at a premium for your services

1885
03:44:01,600 --> 03:44:04,940
I've given you a basic mining machine to get you started with

1886
03:44:05,459 --> 03:44:11,620
Unfortunately, you'll be on your own from this point onward as the settlers who were lucky enough to escape with their lives have fled

1887
03:44:11,780 --> 03:44:15,500
Safety, however, all the shops here have been computerized

1888
03:44:15,780 --> 03:44:21,159
So you'll still be able to sell your minerals you'll up upgrade your pod and buy special items

1889
03:44:22,139 --> 03:44:29,079
Remember your job is to collect minerals and bring them back to the surface for processing the deeper you dig more valuable in minerals

1890
03:44:29,079 --> 03:44:39,569
You will encounter don't forget to refuel. Good luck. His mission terminated refuel $20

1891
03:44:41,739 --> 03:44:56,120
All right, five four dollars purchased. It's time to dig. All right, what's over there? Is that lava or is that minerals?

1892
03:44:56,600 --> 03:45:11,659
Okay, it's minerals. I'm doing all right. Ow, it's like dig-dug. It's like dig-dug. We can sell stuff

1893
03:45:14,399 --> 03:45:18,389
ironium

1894
03:45:18,389 --> 03:45:20,819
silvarium

1895
03:45:20,819 --> 03:45:22,819
bronzium

1896
03:45:22,860 --> 03:45:44,920
Whatever it's it's okay. It's all right. We'll be fine. I went down gold over here

1897
03:45:45,500 --> 03:46:04,520
Much money. All right, just be careful

1898
03:46:05,520 --> 03:46:13,649
Argo Bay full. All right. How do I get out of here? Oh shit, I can fly. Oh

1899
03:46:16,350 --> 03:46:21,079
Oh careful mineral processing huh sell all

Okay, so how do I upgrade? What's over here junk shop? Welcome to the upgrade shop?

1902
03:46:45,860 --> 03:46:46,979
Okay

750 I don't have enough. Okay. Well, I know this is here

1908
03:47:05,370 --> 03:47:20,659

I'll be okay. Hold on. I'm just gonna get a few more

All right, I'm coming back up. I have how much money?

1914
03:47:44,770 --> 03:47:46,770
Where do you put your pair?

1915
03:47:49,559 --> 03:47:51,559
Save your game. Yeah, sure

1916
03:47:54,270 --> 03:47:59,870
You explode if you run out of fuel it's all it's right, okay

1917
03:48:00,389 --> 03:48:02,000
There it is

1918
03:48:02,620 --> 03:48:10,479
This reserve fuel tank you can't afford any this art repair I could have just done that. All right

03:48:10,479 --> 03:48:17,639
I'm gonna buy that the drill

1988
04:02:25,409 --> 04:02:39,370
