1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:16,859
What's up? How you doing? You doing good? Where you been? Oh, you doing that? Oh, man. Me too.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:29,699
He's in the bathroom. I'm not in the bathroom. Sitting at my desk. I missed a huge raid?

3
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:40,359
Uh, I did not. I'm looking over here. I don't see anything. I was already raided. You can't raid an

4
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:56,219
offline channel, can you? No, you cannot. You can? You can. I did not know you could do that. You can

5
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:08,969
raid an offline channel. That's just dropping a bunch of people off at like an empty movie theater

6
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:16,739
with the screen blank. They're like, enjoy the movie, stupid. And just taking off. Like,

7
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,849
I bust you guys into a movie theater in this new movie playing. It wasn't any scheduled movie for

8
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:33,989
that day or that time. And then what do you do? Where do you go? You guys all like shake hands

9
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:39,189
and like, oh, see you later. I guess there's no movie here. And you go out of the movie theaters

10
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:47,689
you're in. And you start just opening up other doors to other movies. Hey, dude, dude, Force

11
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,609
Awakens is playing over here. Oh, this is not cool, man. Like 10 of you go that way. You just go in.

12
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,409
Like 40 of you go see, I don't know, what was it? Popular movie that came out like last year or two

13
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:08,919
years ago? Nightways? I don't know. What was that? 2010? I don't know. I don't see movies. I don't

14
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:21,180
know what movies have come out. Anyways, today we're gonna play Speaking of Star Wars. We're gonna

15
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,560
play Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy. This is one of the most requested games that I've gotten

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:37,060
on this channel in a long time. People are like, dude, get in that game right now. I don't care

17
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,129
what you're doing. Stop doing everything and play Jedi Academy. I played Jedi Academy multiplayer

18
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:50,780
with Star like six or seven years ago. I never played the actual video game. So we're gonna play

19
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,020
the out that was loud and I good thing I muted the desktop audio because a bunch of you would

20
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:06,699
have just flew out of your chair like I almost just did. You can thank me later. Slaughter, slaughter.

21
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:20,229
I love this game. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I just did. Fuck you. Fuck you. What's going on

22
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:26,419
here? You're gonna murder younglings. I am a youngling. So no, I'm one of the younglings.

23
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,400
Hey, easy case. Thanks for the 10 community subs and cry Thor TV. Thanks for 515 subs right here.

24
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:48,740
Thanks guys. He thinks he's young. I am young to heart. That's all that matters. A 35 year old man

25
00:03:49,860 --> 00:04:01,189
and at least like 26 year old man's body. And then when I'm like 45, I'm gonna be a 45 year old man

26
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:11,379
in like a 32 year old body. And then when I turn 50, you're just 50. You're just 50. That's where

27
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:24,149
you start to become you just become old at like 50 plus other way around. No, that means I'm I look

28
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:30,569
young. I'm a 45 year old man and like a 32 year old man's body. Like I'm I still I look like a 32

29
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:38,949
year old at like 45. 40 is the new 30. Anyways, I don't give a shit what anybody says. All right,

30
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:46,759
let's go. Let me unmute this. The new game here make sure you have new game selected.

31
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:54,839
45 year old cams not on better not be killed. We got Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy.

32
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:03,720
I think I make a actual Star War, right? Why don't I use that as a noun? Like it was a person.

33
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:13,860
I okay. I'm not gonna do anything hard. Extremely difficult game, difficult game,

34
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:22,300
normal game or easy game. I'm just doing normal fuck all that bullshit. We go. All right. Are you

35
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:33,879
you buckle your seatbelt? Good. Here we go. All right. Species. Hold on. Turn on. Turn this way.

36
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:48,550
This is there's a character creator. Keldor male. Maybe. Rodian male. Zabrak human. Should I just be

37
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:58,709
a human? I feel like if you can't play a human because that's just like making a human in

38
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,870
World of Warcraft. Like I'm on my like eighth character. I guess it's going to be another

39
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:18,579
human. No, you don't want to make a human. Maybe I kind of do. I think I want to make a human.

40
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:31,610
That's so boring. But whatever. Don't fucking do it. Oh my God. But I don't know. All right. I

41
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:40,410
changed my mind. I think I want to be this guy. No, wait. This one. No, no, no, no, no. This one

42
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:52,779
is Big Rideau. I don't want to be Rideau. OK, I think this one. All right. So that's the head

43
00:06:52,779 --> 00:07:05,899
torso. I don't want to make any more World of Warcraft references, but this is all

44
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,370
like starter gear. This is like level one tabard. I'd be level one tabard non-human

45
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:23,740
Rodian male. I made my own guild. I haven't even gotten the 10 signatures yet. And I tried to make

46
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:33,300
my own tabard. Tabard. Whatever. I'm going to make wild jokes today, I guess. Relax. Relax. Relax.

47
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:41,060
Oh, wow. He made a World of Warcraft joke again. It's just in the top of the mind. I don't know why.

48
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:54,410
What color do I want? I like the gray. Yeah. All right. Looks good. Hmm. That looks good too.

49
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:06,139
What do you think? This? I like those boots. This is a good setup. All right. Yeah, this is fine.

50
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:22,250
Oh, shit. OK, hold on. This is incredibly important. What? There's only one lightsaber?

51
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:36,730
Oh, man. Hold on. Which one of these do I want? All right. I kind of want the kazoo. Yeah, this

52
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:50,809
thing you go and you can put it in your mouth and be like, um, it's a blunt. No, just don't hold it

53
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:57,769
the wrong way. You press the wrong button. You don't press like the kazoo button. It just goes

54
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,769
right to the back of your head. Um, what do I? I don't want to be like the Luke Skywalker. Look,

55
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm not going to do this. Maybe I am. Orange is kind of cool. Although I would probably have like,

56
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:18,070
it would probably be yellow or white. No, no, no, no, no. Of course it wouldn't.

57
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:28,840
I would have the darksaber. It's only one and it's mine. I would use it. I would be my blade.

58
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:50,419
I think I want to do purple school while you're out partying. I studied.

59
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,299
What? All right. No. OK. Well, how about we do the one that's on the shelf at every like target?

60
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:11,399
This one. I like it. I think I might want yellow too. All right. Medium combat style. Medium.

61
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,379
I can't. I can't change that. All right. I cannot change the combat style. I just have a medium

62
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:29,720
saber. Green if you're cool. No, I want the I like I want the like yellow or white or dark saber.

63
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:48,789
I'm ready. Let's go. Oh, here we go. Star Wars. You can't DM see a this stream because it's in a

64
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:59,750
video game, not a real fucking movie. You can't. I've read all kinds of threads about how this works

65
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:11,610
and this is allowed. Is it 10 years after the Battle of Endor, the Imperial remnant continues

66
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,809
to be driven back by the New Republic, forcing the Imperials to adopt increasingly desperate tactics

67
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:27,110
in the ongoing struggle. Meanwhile, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker moves to restore the Jedi to their

68
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,029
formal place as peacekeepers of the galaxy at his Jedi Academy on Yavin IV.

69
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:42,620
What's with the space? Jaden Kor, a promising student from Crusant, is en route to the

70
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,720
Academy after achieving the impossible, creating a lightsaber without any formal Jedi training.

71
00:11:49,720 --> 00:12:05,019
So he's a fraud and he's being brought to the Capitol for justice and prosecution.

72
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:15,340
Crusant. I don't know. I couldn't read it at me. We'll be arriving at the Academy in

73
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:23,340
just a few minutes that Mark Hamill Mark Hamill has to be. That would be so great.

74
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,769
Wait, why is this like Harry Potter? Does this happen? Aren't you excited? We're going to be

75
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:35,370
Jedi learning the ways of the force building a lightsaber. Of course you already have one.

76
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,690
I'm going to get one of those stupid training sabers. I wouldn't worry about that. Wait,

77
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,169
what? I talk? I can't help it. I want to make a good impression. I'm not silent protagonist.

78
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:50,009
You seem really nervous. Aren't you? I mean, why would you be? You already have a lightsaber,

79
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:57,049
so you're probably way ahead of me. I'm Rosh, by the way. I'm not supposed to have this? Why

80
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:03,850
do I have this? What's your name? Jaden. So where'd you get that lightsaber? Well, it's kind of a

81
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:15,610
long story. I found myself on. What? That's the noise you make when you have a wedgie,

82
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:34,779
not the fucking plane is going down. What? We made an emergency landing several clicks west of the

83
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,360
academy. Oh, there it is. Is everyone all right? I think so. We'll send a shuttle to pick you up.

84
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Can you lead the students to the nearby Masasi temple? Is that him? Affirmative Academy. We'll

85
00:13:47,080 --> 00:14:04,629
meet you there. All right, let's go. But who is this? I'm lost on the characters. Holy shit,

86
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:14,200
you go fast. Jaden, we can't get to you. Make your way to the temple. All right. Jaden. Hey,

87
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,519
I'm stuck. Can you help? Hold on, Rosh. I'm on my way. Jaden, see if you can make your way around

88
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:33,879
there. All right, let's go. I bet you wish you had one of these, but I don't know how to use this

89
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:47,220
though. Okay, let's go. Should I put the thing down? Maybe you can use your lightsaber to cut

90
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,580
those trees down and make a bridge. Oh, maybe I can. Yeah, that'd be cool. Come on over here.

91
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,460
Thanks, Jaden. Let's get to the temple. All right, to the temple. Oh, watch out. We've got.

92
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:10,789
I don't know what I think. What? Jaden, see if you can make your way around there.

93
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:17,529
I'm training. I just killed the motherfucker. Maybe you can use your lightsaber to cut those

94
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:25,240
trees down and make a bridge. I didn't know I could kill him. Let's get to the temple.

95
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,960
Do I have a blast? Maybe I shouldn't do anything. Put this thing away.

96
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:46,539
Just flailing around like a kid on Christmas morning that just opened it up. Okay, cool, cool,

97
00:15:46,539 --> 00:16:01,720
cool, cool, cool. This way. Follow me to the temple. Kill him again. I'm not gonna kill him again.

98
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:12,570
I can't. What's in there? Oh, checkpoint. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

99
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah, I would stay the fuck away from this guy. Like, stay at least like five car lengths away

100
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:38,090
from me, man. I'm not going near this guy. What? Why can't I hit him? Pretty cool trick, huh?

101
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,330
I learned that at the. Didn't go to the academy yet. We haven't even stepped in there.

102
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:47,940
Haven't done one class. I watched a few YouTube videos. What do you think?

103
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,299
Self-taught Jedi from YouTube tutorials. Hey, maybe you can use your saber to make another

104
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:24,180
bridge. Hey, dick. Why can you die from that? Such a shitty cadet.

105
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:42,420
All right, just let him do the work. Well, this is what happens, man. With two cadets,

106
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:50,309
we have no idea what we're doing. I just evade this lightsaber. I don't know how the hell I'm

107
00:17:50,309 --> 00:18:02,569
doing with it. Kill. Shoot it. You didn't have a chance. Like, I'm not cool. I'm not with it. I'm

108
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:09,529
just a guy that bought this somehow. This was fucking like $45,000 on eBay. And I thought it

109
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:12,890
was fake, but I was like, you know what? I'm going to go for it. What if it's real? Well,

110
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:30,519
at least it turned out it was real. It's just a murderer on the loose. Hey, maybe you can use

111
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:38,250
your saber to make another bridge. Hey, did he not make it? He didn't make the jump.

112
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:53,319
I am so disappointed that he didn't make the jump. How did you not make the jump? What? He

113
00:18:53,319 --> 00:19:03,799
jumped into the wall. How did you die? I don't understand. Jeremy, use quick save. What button

114
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:20,500
is it? All right, don't kill him. Shoot him. Nice teamwork, man. All right, make the jump.

115
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,039
Hey, maybe you can use your saber to make another bridge. Um, did he die from fall damage?

116
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,799
Oh, my God, I'm so mad that I missed that. He must have died from fall damage.

117
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:39,589
Let's go. Let's go. I feel like I need to keep an eye on you in case you do something stupid.

118
00:19:42,549 --> 00:20:01,259
All right, move. All right, go in. Wait till he's done. Dude, holy shit, we suck.

119
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,920
Mark Hamill right now is like forced TV watching us. He's sitting on his couch,

120
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,480
which is this forced camera pointed at us. Oh, man, I've got a lot of work to do on these two.

121
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,109
I finally sheathed the lightsaber.

122
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,269
All right, I'll check it out. Um, is this supposed to be getting this hot on my hands?

123
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,519
I mean, I don't know. I forgot gloves. It's really hot. It's really hot to hold.

124
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:20,900
Obtain a blaster rifle. Oh, I did. Is that a Sith? Oh, my God, what happened? Quick save.

125
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:28,539
Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What's the quick save button? What's the quick save?

126
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:41,940
Somebody tell me while I'm looking. F5. It's not F5. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

127
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,779
come on, come on. Stop holding your head. I know it's crazy, but go. Hey, maybe you can use your

128
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:58,359
saber to make another bridge. Yes, they can't get over. We're fine. Let's go.

129
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:13,349
What is it? F12 and F9. Okay. That's fucking screenshot. Of course it is.

130
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:27,049
There's gonna be a lot of screenshots today. A lot of them. What's the point of this move?

131
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:35,640
I can't even hit them. Rebind it. Oh, yeah, I couldn't do that. I could do that.

132
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:46,579
Quick save is gonna be, um, hmm, like, I don't know, dash. And then quick, quick load is gonna be

133
00:22:47,460 --> 00:23:01,589
equals. All right, we're good. All right, good. There are stormtroopers over there.

134
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:09,579
You're the one with the lightsaber. I can't skip it. Yes, again. All right, I'm going for it. Wait,

135
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:24,740
we're gonna use my force to save. Okay, then this, who, who is this guy? I'm not the lightsaber.

136
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:53,480
I'm Sith. Wait, is this a, this must be a cadet too. This is a Sith cadet. All right, kill him.

137
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:12,940
You lost to a kid. I didn't actually turn dismemberment on. I think it is. Turn on

138
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:24,890
dismemberment. It's on. It's not. Turn it on. Turn it on. It's not on. What? It can be more?

139
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,359
Yeah, what is actually, what you mean? What? The console command? Okay, I'll do it.

140
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:44,740
Who are you? Katarn, at your service. Welcome to a day in the life of a gym. What happened?

141
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:53,140
What did happen? Traitor. I saw a huge flash of light and ran over to find you. Just lying

142
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:03,180
unconscious. Do you recall anything? I saw three people. One was holding some sort of scepter and

143
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,450
it was glowing. That's all I can remember. A scepter? That sounds bad. Are you able to stand? Yeah.

144
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:19,049
Yeah, I'm okay. Peter. Stop. You always sense a disturbance in the force.

145
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:24,569
But yeah. No, he should look back and say, okay, Spider-Man. Residual dark side aura from this

146
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:33,079
temple. Absent. You'll stay here and investigate. I'd love to. Why don't you take the kids back home

147
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:43,140
now? Be careful, Kyle. You thought that was Yoshi singing? That was Luke Skywalker. It was. Singing.

148
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:55,500
Did you recover Skywalker's records? I have no idea what just happened. Yes.

149
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,779
With all the Jedi in the jungle, it was almost too easy. Excellent. Let's actually go over what

150
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:06,539
they're actually doing with their mouths here. I'd like to welcome all our new students to the Jedi.

151
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:14,779
It's like, you will learn to defend yourself with a lightsaber. You will also study diplomacy,

152
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:21,740
history, and more. Oh, it has been the practice of the Jedi diplomacy, history, math. However,

153
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,619
since there are still so few of us, we will be assigning multiple students to one master.

154
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:34,819
Ralph, you will be assigned to master home. I can't wait to begin my training.

155
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:39,140
Stop talking, dude. You're gonna get in trouble. What the? You will be assigned to master Katarn.

156
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,259
Jaden Kor, you'll also work with master Katarn. Now, let's begin with your first lessons. And may

157
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:51,609
the force be with you. And there was nothing, but the area around the temple felt strange.

158
00:26:51,609 --> 00:27:00,059
There it is. Dark side aura was gone. Troubling. But let's look into this later. Your students are

159
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:08,170
ready to get started. Master Katarn, it's an honor to be serving under you. First of all,

160
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,329
just call me Kyle. The titles make my skin crawl. Okay, Mr. Kyle. You're not serving under me.

161
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:22,359
I'm gonna teach you, and you're gonna learn. That's it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.

162
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,720
Don't worry, Rosh. You didn't. I'm offended by professionals.

163
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,980
This is the bad guy. Super relatable in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie.

164
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,980
Somebody that you start to trust. Bad guy alert. Bad guy alert. Call me Kyle. Bad guy.

165
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,289
This is one of the many training grounds of the academy.

166
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:50,329
What's the super dismemberment? When you're ready, Jaden, go through that door.

167
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,769
Wait. Oh, God. The chat's gonna be going so fast.

168
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:06,099
Here. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, main character for the past three games. He was the hero of the last

169
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:17,589
game. Oh. Oh, well. Fucking completely wrong. I don't play these games. Oh, I have to download

170
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:24,789
a dismemberment mod. I'm not doing that right now. I'll do that. I'll do that on a break.

171
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:31,769
No, you don't. No, you don't. It's a console command. Somebody just gave me like a download

172
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:43,799
link. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. We'll get G saber dismemberment one. Is that it? G saber

173
00:28:43,799 --> 00:29:03,829
dismemberment one. Is that gonna work? That's the one. Three. Set it to three. I don't- I don't-

174
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:15,099
Set it to three? What the fuck? God damn it. Three? But I don't wanna do- All right. I just

175
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:25,400
typed it in. I just did it. All right. It's in. What just happened? Why did I lose the game?

176
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:36,759
It's a simple- I just did it. Okay. All right. Let's go. What are we doing?

177
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,839
Well, at least I'm just burning him.

178
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,410
Teacher, teacher. Teacher, we have a problem. Teacher, teacher, teacher. Teacher, I don't know

179
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:07,500
what happened to him. How do I get in? He turned around. He like caught me an idiot and then like

180
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:15,619
he went forward and it went through his neck. I turn around for two seconds and this is what

181
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:26,950
you two fools do. What am I supposed to do? All right. This is my training, right? Hey,

182
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:33,259
why'd you close it behind me? This course will familiarize you with your core force abilities.

183
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:38,859
These are powers that every force user has. As you progress in your training, you will learn new

184
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:46,299
abilities. Both the light and dark sides will be open to you. Remember, abilities are not inherently

185
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:53,339
good or evil. It's how you use them. Every Jedi is naturally stronger in different areas of the force

186
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,539
and it will be up to you to decide what to focus on. Yep, dark side. I'm gonna go fold.

187
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,539
I want to shoot electricity at my hands. How do we do that? Kyle, how do I shoot electricity at my

188
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:12,019
hands? These will help you lightsaber. Ready? Was that him saying that three times? Like three, two, one?

189
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,940
Okay, so I just did the block. He's doing it automatically.

190
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:48,140
Oh, okay. I thought I was supposed to ricochet back like Luke does in movie four. What a spoiler.

191
00:31:48,140 --> 00:32:02,980
Nice work, Rush. I just run through? You did well too, Jaden. Oh, he's talking about both of us.

192
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,380
Even when inactive, it can diffuse a potentially volatile situation.

193
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:14,759
Trust me on that. As you train over additional fighting styles, changing styles during combat

194
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,279
can surprise your opponent, allowing you to gain the upper hand. Okay. From here on out, we'll talk

195
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:33,000
via comm link in each area. Let's move on. Moving up. New objective. Okay, Jaden. Use the force.

196
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:56,309
I have to do a force jump? How do I do a force jump? I don't know. He didn't tell me how to do it.

197
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:04,359
What kind of training is this? What kind of training is that? Hey, Jaden, do a force jump.

198
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:21,000
How? I don't know. Just use the force. Yeah, you just have to believe, right? Isn't that the whole

199
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,480
force? You have to believe that you can do it, therefore you can do it. Okay, so how do I do this?

200
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:43,660
You have to look in the game manual. All right, key binds. Movement. Hold use plus step to lean.

201
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:53,289
Okay. Run, walk, step. Force powers. Push, pull, speed, sense, absorb. Force power. Force next.

202
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:14,280
Okay. Force speed. Hold the jump button. What? This is regular jump. Force power.

203
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:24,539
All right. Push is F1. Ooh. Hey, Jaden, this should keep you busy till I finish the course.

204
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:39,050
No, he's cheating. No, he's the bad guy. Okay, got it. Oh, that's General Grievous. Force,

205
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:54,869
push. It's just Tony Hawk. Oh, dismemberment. I see it. It just is Tony Hawk underground.

206
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,030
God damn it. That's exactly what this is. It's just they don't have skateboards. They have

207
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:44,969
lightsabers. Okay. What do I do? Oh, what is this thing though? Force push. Nope. Force slide.

208
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:02,650
Okay. Force sense is F3. Oh, I've never pressed that button. It just makes the FOV turn off.

209
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:15,880
Turn it off right now. Oh my god, that hurt. I hated every second of that. What are these things?

210
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:32,650
Use your force sense. It's health. Oh, okay. Is force sense just a little blue circle thing?

211
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:47,559
Or do I actually have to press F3 because I hate that? F4. Oh, I hate that too. I also hate that.

212
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:26,409
What am I looking for? A way to get out. A wall? I mean, I just have to get up there, but what?

213
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:39,000
Use your force brain. Use your force brain. Okay. So what do I do about these?

214
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:54,969
Press them. Force push them. Pull them out. Get up there. Use your force brain.

215
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:25,019
I just love deal of fates. All right. Wait. This is going to be dangerous. Force jump. Force sense.

216
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:36,329
In this next area, you can use the force to speed up both physically and mentally.

217
00:38:38,630 --> 00:39:00,519
Okay. Force rugs. That's what that is. Okay. F3 is force speed. What the fuck? I'm being too slow.

218
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:09,739
No, I don't have any force power left. Hold on. Where's the force energy bar?

219
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:29,179
Oh, just barely made it. It wasn't a competition. I'm sorry. I am gizing too. It's no big deal.

220
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,500
Hurry the fuck up. Oh, here we are. This wasn't a competition. That's a I'm a punch puncher in

221
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:49,420
the face pose. Expel him. You're expelled. Doing a great Sims impression.

222
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,829
He just said something to Jayden that he did not like.

223
00:39:55,909 --> 00:40:03,260
Apology accepted, Rod. That's settled. It's Kyle. Yes, Matt. Uh, Kyle. Matt?

224
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,099
Okay. Do you almost call him Matt? He forgot his first name. Sorry about that, Matt. Oh,

225
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:21,780
yeah. Your name's not Matt. Kyle. Right. Another first name. Did some research on that strange

226
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,380
mark from the clothing we found at the temple. It is the symbol of Marco Ragnos, a Sith Lord

227
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,659
that died almost 5,000 years ago. 5,000 years. Are you serious? Do you know Jesus? Of course,

228
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:40,260
you're serious. Holy shit. Be on the lookout for information regarding a group affiliated

229
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,929
with Ragnos. Sure thing, Luke. Jesus was like the original Jedi. You receive countless requests

230
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:53,929
for assistance from all over the galaxy. Since we believe in at the academy, students of all

231
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:59,099
levels help with these requests. Since you're an initiate, however, Kyle will travel with you

232
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,369
on most of your missions in order to instruct you and ensure your safety. Okay. So wait, did

233
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:18,500
my report card? I killed six people on my first day. What? Okay, hold on. Wait, this is missions?

234
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:32,119
Cult investigation, merchant rescue, emergency assistance, droid recovery, or mercenary activity.

235
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:45,179
Cult investigation on Corellia. Okay. The city of Coronet on Corellia has had numerous reports

236
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:51,420
of activity by the disciples of Ragnos. However, it's not clear if it's really the Sith cult

237
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,820
or if the locals are just being paranoid about after hearing about it on the holonet.

238
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:03,960
Go to Coronet and determine the truth. I still have a few contacts in Coronet. We'll hit a few

239
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,679
of the local cantinas and see what crops up. We'll also follow up with some of the people

240
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:15,860
who reported this so-called cult activity. It looks like Earth. The screen allows you to

241
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:22,789
increase any one force power by a single rank. The maximum is third rank. Look on any light or dark

242
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:27,909
force power icon to upgrade. Core powers cannot be upgraded. Once a power has been upgraded,

243
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:33,190
the weapon screen will be made available. Return the upgraded power to its original rank. Click on

244
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:44,340
it again. Oh, here we go. Dark side. Force drain. Allows Jedi to transfer the life essence of a

245
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:54,219
person to themself. Okay. Force grip is the Darth Vader choke. Darth Vader choke. There it is. I

246
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:59,480
don't care. That's what I want. Lightning. Allows Jedi to hurl devastating electrical attacks out

247
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:07,130
of their hands. Jedi launches a single bolt that fires forward to do instant damage. Wait, hold on.

248
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:29,980
Yeah. You're a traitor. No. I can control it. Said every single person before him. Unlimited power.

249
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,699
Weapons. This screen allows you to choose two weapons and a throwable device for the upcoming

250
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:39,400
mission. A lightsaber and a blaster pistol are given to you. Choose a weapon, click on the icon

251
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,599
to deselect a weapon. Okay. All right. Where's just, where's black robe and bare hands?

252
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:59,769
Destructive electro magnetic pulse gun. What's this? Thermal detonator? Oh, I want a grenade.

253
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:08,969
Okay. Mines or packs? I want the grenade. Pulse rifle used against droids. Ripping apart living

254
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:24,219
material. All right, cool. And the Wookie crossbow. All right. Begin. Let's go.

255
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:35,750
Jan punches the weak way right in the holy shit. Eyes on the road. Are we crashing or is this

256
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,110
normal coming from that cargo trap? Wait, this is like we're going down. Oh, we're on train.

257
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:53,590
No, we're not. How you fly this plane. You can't even see. We're just sitting in front of a

258
00:44:53,590 --> 00:45:04,469
computer. You take the tram. I'll take care of these ships. Okay. How do I do the, uh,

259
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:16,489
uh, okay. Weapons, force powers, lightning has, I don't know. Okay. Mouse four is going to be

260
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:21,690
lightning. Oh my God. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Good, good, good. All right. Let's go.

261
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:51,099
Open the door right now. Open the door. R2, get them to open the door. R2. All right. The other

262
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:55,579
side of this door definitely should have a video camera and just play that for the ad for the

263
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:05,820
company that made the doors. That's all you need. Is there a lever? Where's the lever?

264
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:16,550
Wait, I can't go in there. I'm trying to force pull. I can't force pull through glass.

265
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:44,820
All right. Let's, holy shit. Shock him. That's it. Get out of here. You're dealing with a Jedi

266
00:46:44,820 --> 00:47:10,920
master. What? Oh, it's C3Ville. That cut his head off. Just member men. It's on. I turned it on.

267
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:37,909
It's level three. All right. Force pull. Force pull. Use your force hands. Dude, I'm trying to

268
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:53,719
interact with this. It's not speed. What's going on? Press enter. What the fuck? Enter. All right.

269
00:47:53,719 --> 00:48:10,630
Nope. Sit down. Wait, I need to go back that way. Force hands. Press enter. All right. So now what?

270
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:37,960
We detached the train. Do the console command again. Hold on. Not yet. Save it. I just did.

271
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:49,769
Save. All right. We're good with this backup. Looking good. All right. Force jump. Wait. Use

272
00:48:49,769 --> 00:49:05,369
this force speed. Good. Is that good? Good blaster or bad blaster? Okay. Green does not mean good

273
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:16,730
blaster health. No, I'm not a Jedi. Jedi in training. But thank you. I appreciate it. That

274
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:27,460
means I must be doing pretty well. Uh oh. Sith training. He doesn't know that I have Sith powers

275
00:49:27,460 --> 00:50:05,719
too though. He's fucked. You're next. Tell me to stop. Stop. Stop. Force gun. Can I take the

276
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:42,039
lightsaber? Oops. Power up. Got it. Cut that arm off. That's a warning. That's a warning. I'm going

277
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:55,860
to give one shot to get out of here. I gave him a warning. I'm good. I'm a Jedi. I gave you a

278
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:07,500
warning. I said go home. Get out of here. It's not worth it. And he decided to charge me. I have to

279
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:18,500
do the commands in order. Hold on. What do you want me to do? Help us Obi-Wan, then G saber more

280
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,059
realistic, then G dismemberment three. What are you telling me to do here? What is all this bullshit?

281
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:59,260
This is gonna make the game like a joke. Not yet. I'm having fun playing Jedi Master. Oh my god.

282
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,590
I actually killed him. I killed him. Did I kill him? This is gonna give me at least like a

283
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:26,039
$50 an hour raise. No, no, no, no. What's quick load? Take it off. You have to do three commands

284
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:30,920
in order. All right. Well, I'm not doing them right now. Okay. I'm doing them in like 10 minutes.

285
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:52,179
Fuck. Fuck. In the head, in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head,

286
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:56,659
in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head and shoot him in the head. I'm a fucking Jedi.

287
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:19,900
They don't even use guns. How do I get up there? Jesus. You can tell I have low HP. He just knows.

288
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:53,369
That's why he ran over here. What happened to him? What? Why did he go forward? Why did he go forward?

289
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:18,730
Holy shit. Okay. How do I get up there? I'm gonna go up. Is there a force jump? Force sense.

290
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:35,110
No force sense. Force walk. Force walk to where? Force stairs. Is there a... Wait,

291
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:43,190
are there four stairs over here? Almost fucking fell. Wait. All right. I see a force. Oh boy.

292
00:54:43,190 --> 00:55:14,940
Hold on. Okay. I'm gonna... What if I do speed? Oh, did you hear that? Oh my god. I landed like

293
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:46,340
roof. How do I get up here? Just fucking kill him. Obtain heavy repeater. Is there a door

294
00:55:47,960 --> 00:56:07,590
inside that door? What door? Inside that door. Other door. I don't see a door. Use the force.

295
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:21,940
Yeah. Is this one open? This one doesn't open. This is a children's game. That's not... Not

296
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:34,570
everything is a children's game. I have to get up here. Go a full car back. Yeah, that's what I'm

297
00:56:34,570 --> 00:57:01,480
doing. I'm gonna go up. Okay. Then we gotta go up. Up here. All right. Up. Fuck. No. In the door.

298
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:26,650
Okay. I did it. The other ones didn't. Whoa. Easy. Is there health? I need a health pack

299
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:48,699
somewhere. Force health. God damn it. I thought it was a crate that had items in it or something.

300
00:57:48,699 --> 00:58:15,289
I don't know, man. What do you want to say? What? Okay. I have one health. Give me a fucking break.

301
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:28,219
Whatever. There's no health. I just have to be good. Quick save. Quick save now. God damn it,

302
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:34,539
Jeremy. Get up there. Use force heal. I don't have it. I got lightning ability first.

303
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:50,889
Okay. You guys are both in deep shit when I get in there. Believe you me. The second that this

304
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:56,710
drops, this is going right through your spine. You understand? I'll give you a little preview.

305
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,179
Yeah. What was that move? You have no idea. Bang. Electricity out of my hands. What, you have a gun?

306
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:11,610
A little blaster? Cute. Really nice. Cool. Sure. Can you do this? No, you can't. So give me the

307
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:21,480
fucking code to get to the main base and I'll think about letting you out because you're not locked in

308
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:29,320
here with me. I'm locked in here with you. No, no. Other way. You're fucked is what I'm saying.

309
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:42,219
That's one down. That's one down. I'm telling you. You're going to be in big trouble. Oh.

310
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:55,670
Fucked a big game on that one. Oh, that's right. I had one HP. Shit. Right. Right, right, right,

311
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:05,909
right, right, right, right, right, right. Sorry. I forgot. I forgot. I have to hide. I'm going to

312
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:20,039
hide like a gun. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I'm going to throw a grenade in there. What the fuck?

313
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,719
It's an explosive barrel. Of course it is. Get up. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick save it up here so

314
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:40,699
it doesn't happen to you. Quick save. Okay. Get rid of this shit. I don't want to accidentally

315
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:52,789
explode. Okay. I've cleared the room. I'm ready. Now I'm going to get rid of this shit and I'm

316
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:59,099
going to throw a grenade in there. That's that one. Quick save it right here. Okay. Where's the

317
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:27,820
grenades? How do you fucking throw these? Okay. Those things suck. Oh, is this beer? Holy shit.

318
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,079
This is what they were defending. Yeah. There's like the hops and the vats and stuff. This is

319
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:44,539
like a beer factory. Belt of thermal detonators. Wait. Oh, thank God. Okay. Heal. Yeah. These are

320
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:51,510
kegs and bottles and this is the shipment, man. This is the shipment right here. Quick save. I

321
01:01:51,510 --> 01:02:15,980
got it. Oh my fucking glass. Of course. That was frustrating. It was glass. Now what do I go?

322
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:31,099
This way. Okay. Here we go. I'm going in here. What happened? You all right? What happened? I want

323
01:02:31,099 --> 01:03:02,869
to go in here. Quick save. Here we go. Watch it. Head pack. Now that's... That's not fair. Why is

324
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:12,500
that not happening to him? All right. You know what? Just get over there. Just watch out. Dodge,

325
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:45,210
dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge. Too far. Oh my God. Ow. Oh. Oh. Shit. I'm getting too... All right.

326
01:03:45,210 --> 01:04:08,730
It's the shaking camera. Fuck. Okay. I'm good. He actually hit me. You got to be shitting me.

327
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:50,809
What does this even do? Whoa. Did I dodge it? Okay. I dodged it. Got him. Okay. Save. Pile.

328
01:04:50,969 --> 01:05:34,260
Oh, great. Whoa. Get out of here. Get out of here. Come here, you fucking dick. Push him off. Push

329
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:54,980
him off. Push him off. How much force juice do I have? I can't force push him. Wait. This is not

330
01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:14,650
enough for him. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Use a quick force grenade.

331
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:26,139
Hold on. I'm busy. Holy shit. Okay. I'm ready. Here's what we're gonna do. Detonation packs.

332
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:38,440
We're gonna play this so fucking cowardly. I don't even care. Okay. How do I blow them up?

333
01:06:44,150 --> 01:07:05,639
They are. Come out here and find out. Right click. Jesus. That wasn't even the right guy.

334
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:16,440
That wasn't even the Jedi. Oh, shit. No. That was the wrong guy. Oh, come on. All right. Whatever.

335
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:39,130
Get out here. My lightsaber grenades will take you down. He's dead. I think he's dead.

336
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:50,889
All right. This time I'm not gonna screw this up. Oh, my fucking god. Get me in here.

337
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:55,849
This time I'm not gonna just have the one dude come out with a blaster and have me blow him to

338
01:07:55,849 --> 01:08:06,550
hell. All right. Here we go. Ready? Come on. Whatever. Give me a regular blaster.

339
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:41,210
Okay. I'm ready. Oh, shit. What? It didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do

340
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:58,359
anything. What happened? That's right click, isn't it? It's right click, isn't it? You guys

341
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:06,619
said right click. Is it proximity? Are you throwing on purpose? No. I thought it was

342
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:12,949
detonations. The lightning zapped the bomb. I didn't do anything. I didn't press anything.

343
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:22,140
The lightning hit it. Wait. Oh, lightning. You mean like environmental lightning. Are you kidding

344
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:43,659
me? I didn't press any button. Oh, would you die already? Okay. Save this shit right here.

345
01:09:44,380 --> 01:10:07,579
Here we go. All right. Come get me. Yeah. Nice taunt. Good luck. Come on over here.

346
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:26,380
Why? I'm just killing this motherfucker right now. He blocked it. He blocked it.

347
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:54,569
Big mistake. Oh my god. He slit my throat. Get the fuck over here. Come on. Come here.

348
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,300
Just walk down this.

349
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:50,489
Knock him off. Knock him off. Just knock him off. Knock him off. Knock him off.

350
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:30,659
Got him. All right. Got him. What happened? What happened? It was the bomb. Yeah. I didn't touch it.

351
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:36,380
Wait. Should I press all the buttons? These buttons? That's a bomb. I have to. Okay. Hold on.

352
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:52,220
Hold on a second. Let me. What is this doing? Disarm the bomb. Did I get it? Disarm the bomb?

353
01:12:52,699 --> 01:13:01,529
That wasn't so bad. Okay. Mission accomplished. Is it? Let's just pull the top up.

354
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:06,739
The tram is speeding up. I think they're going to ram it into the station.

355
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:24,970
You have to get to the control room and stop that train. What? Bye. Nice. They're going to ram it

356
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:38,810
into the station. I got to get down there right now. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Force speed. Force

357
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:55,510
speed. Go. What the fuck is this person? I thought he was going to go right.

358
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:18,149
Force push. That's an execute. Okay. Why does he always throw? What do you mean always throw?

359
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:22,069
A guy literally just jumped cartwheeled into frame with a lightsaber on and I had a little

360
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:39,899
bit of a panic. I got hit by a building. Oh my God. You motherfucker. I can't believe you just

361
01:14:39,899 --> 01:15:12,409
headshot me. What the fuck? It's running. Turn and face me, coward. All right. That guy can

362
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:29,500
instantly kill me. Oh my God. Somebody told me this mission was hard. Well, I'm doing pretty

363
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:47,960
good. I think it's on easy. No, it's not. It's on medium. I always get shit for playing on like

364
01:15:49,399 --> 01:16:20,329
whatever. Oh my fucking Jesus. How many times do I get? I don't have any health.

365
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:50,890
Die already. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's hit him in the head. Okay.

366
01:17:50,890 --> 01:18:32,069
All right. Here we go. Is he jumping over this? Go ahead. Do a dodge again. Dodge it again.

367
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:40,569
Careful. It's on your right side. Be careful. Careful. Ooh, that was a good one too. Careful

368
01:18:40,569 --> 01:19:26,359
though. Yeah. What's going on with my eyes? What? What do you mean deserves? No. Oh, come on. No way.

369
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,949
No way. I have to something. I have to get like lightning to strike or something.

370
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:44,069
Come on. Lightning strike. Get me back into this. Come on. A lightning strike will probably fix it.

371
01:19:44,069 --> 01:20:13,880
I need to restart the game. Okay. All right. I'm going to restart. Restart the game. Try restarting.

372
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:32,979
And all right. I'll turn on the alternative dismemberment shit after this mission. After

373
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:47,909
this mission. I will. I promise you guys see. Okay. Let's try it again. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

374
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:58,010
Whoa. Whoa. Okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. All right.

375
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:18,920
All right. All right. I'm going to fuck this guy up. Come on down. Charge the sniper. How do I charge

376
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:41,579
sniper? I can just air shot him. I can't dodge everything, man. Okay. Now let's go up and hold

377
01:21:41,579 --> 01:22:13,739
fire. Does that work? Just get over here. Get over here. Watch out. This guy's got blasters right

378
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:27,420
there. I got it. Did I win? Oh, okay. It's slow mode. That was weird. Come the fuck on, dude.

379
01:22:28,140 --> 01:23:18,329
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. How do you fucking miss? My god. Worst Jedi ever.

380
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:38,729
Get the fuck out of here. All right. My goodness. Can I get to the end? I made it. Thank god. I did it.

381
01:23:56,859 --> 01:23:57,340
Rage.

382
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:14,760
Force you. I'm fucking begging you. All right. I will. I will. Darth Vader. It's definitely Darth

383
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:31,619
Vader. How about mercenary activity? A number of reports that the disciples of Ragnos have been

384
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:36,260
trying to hire mercenaries and smugglers to haul some cargo. If we can contact one of these

385
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:41,770
mercenary groups, we can find out the cult's base of operations. One of the smuggling rings that we

386
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:46,409
know about is based in Morse Isley. Go there and see what you can find out. This one sounds like

387
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:51,529
it could be nasty, so I'll be going with you. You'll find some of the galaxy's worst low lives

388
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:58,579
on Tatooine. My parents are from Tatooine, and I spent like 15 to 20 years there. Grown up.

389
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:15,020
Thanks, though. All right. Force heal. Jedi have the ability to heal themselves after injury.

390
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:24,100
Thank god. Okay. Jedi heal. What about weapons? I want to pick a different lightsaber.

391
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:31,350
I'll try the electromagnetic blaster, and I'll just take the regular blaster.

392
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:39,899
Level three lightning is amazing, though. Most force powers are totally useless until level three.

393
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:49,260
Oh. All right. Dismember. All right, I'm gonna do the- after this cutscene. Hold on,

394
01:25:49,260 --> 01:26:11,579
we're gonna get ambushed. Relax. Do we know them? Kyle does.

395
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:21,109
Stay here and guard the entrance to the docking bay. If anyone tries to enter or

396
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:25,750
leave, detain them. I'll head over to the crate canteen and ask around. Don't let anybody leave.

397
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:34,899
Don't let anybody get in. You can- I won't let you down. Nobody leaves. Nobody gets in.

398
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:57,029
Oh, hi. A Jedi? Me? No, not yet. I'm one of Kyle Katarn's students. He's talking to some locals.

399
01:26:57,909 --> 01:27:05,510
What'd he- I need to kill you. Don't let anybody out. Don't let anybody in. I have to kill him.

400
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:15,739
He has to die. I'm abandoning my post. I'm not supposed to be doing this.

401
01:27:34,380 --> 01:28:17,770
I don't think he can kill Chewbacca. Wait! What? I'm so sad about it, too. I can't believe what

402
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:26,489
just happened. All right, Chewie. All right, Chewie! Chewie! What are you thinking, man?

403
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:36,149
Get in there. Smoke. Dismemberment. All right, fine. I'll do it. What is it? A console command?

404
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:42,500
Quick save. And give me the- give me the- give me it. This better be worth it. And you better

405
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:48,680
not ruin my game or else I'm gonna be very upset with you. All right, do I have to put in the-

406
01:28:49,399 --> 01:29:03,130
do I have to put in the quotation marks? Oh, no. Okay, no quotation marks. Hold on. I have to-

407
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:17,460
every time I alt-tab, I have to fucking- give me a sec. Hold on. Okay. Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi 1.

408
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:33,020
I can remove this shit later, right? I better be able to. I'm gonna be very upset if I can't.

409
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:50,010
Okay. Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi 1, then Saber Realistic in this order- in the correct way.

410
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:55,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Help us Jerma 1, then more ass dump truck 3. Stop.

411
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:14,010
G Saber More Realistic 3. Okay. It's one space at- like, G Saber More Realistic space 3, right?

412
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:23,350
G Saber More Realistic is right protected. I- I can't do it. I have to, like, do it in the actual,

413
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:39,270
like, INI file. So, I'm sorry. Didn't do the first one right. Yes, I did. Help us Obi- Help us Obi-Wan.

414
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:52,819
I did that already. Help us Obi-space 1. And then Saber More Realistic. I have to run this

415
01:30:52,819 --> 01:31:03,020
as an admin. Just do dismemberment 5. Let him- yeah, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. You need the

416
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:17,140
quotation marks. I'm done. I'm just playing the game. I'm done. Wait, how come- you guys haven't

417
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:30,920
seen any of this? Oh, uh, I probably should have, like- oh yeah, oops. Sorry. I'm done.

418
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:52,649
Worst gamer moment. I can't use the console. Yes, I can. I'm done. G dismember- G underscore

419
01:31:52,649 --> 01:32:07,270
dismemberment 5. It needs to be quotes? I need quotes. He didn't put the quotes in. What the

420
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:23,460
fuck, dude? Help us Obi-Wan. That doesn't matter. That is stupid. You need mods for it. All right.

421
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,479
Yeah, well, you guys don't have any idea what's going on. You guys don't have any idea what's

422
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:48,039
going on. Oh, Chattis, no idea what's going on. You have to go to the config files. Yeah, well,

423
01:32:48,039 --> 01:32:53,640
I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna play the game. I'm not gonna turn the game off, do the config,

424
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,840
test it. Did it work? It didn't work. I have to go back into the console. It didn't work.

425
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:08,420
Whoopsie daisy. You gotta go fucking do this and then fucking do that. You have to defrag the

426
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:30,359
hard drive. So much false shit. How do I get out of here? Chewie, where do we go? Turn on the sex

427
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:45,159
scenes. Where are we supposed to even go? I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy trying to, like,

428
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:50,439
turn on, like, big head mode and, like, they're in go-karts and their heads fly off when you hit

429
01:33:50,439 --> 01:34:14,279
them once. Watch out, Chewie. I'll do my best Han Solo, Chewie, for you guys. I'll do it as much

430
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:38,199
as I can. I'm gonna try really hard. There needs to be a scenario where I say it, though. I don't

431
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:51,020
know why I thought for one second I thought that was him talking. Chewie! That was bad.

432
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:56,460
It was supposed to be... I didn't expect him to shoot yet.

433
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:05,319
Oh! Chewie, Chewie, Chewie, Chewie, don't go out there. Chewie, that's a bad idea.

434
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:13,399
But I'm gonna snipe this person from, like, a hundred miles away. Whoops. Whoops. I don't

435
01:35:13,399 --> 01:35:31,850
have it anymore. Where's it? Oh, come on. Nice. Took his leg off. Look at that dismemberment.

436
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:53,859
Chewie! Doctor him! Get him, Chewie! What happened? Oh my god, conserve your health,

437
01:36:53,859 --> 01:37:01,720
please. Oh, shit. Chewie, that was a weird way to... What? Why did Chewie just go like...

438
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:19,020
I don't know how Chewie talks. What's force heal? Okay, controls. Drink rage. Okay, force heal.

439
01:37:19,739 --> 01:37:32,069
Oh my god, that's so useful. I'm just gonna do it again. Like, I don't care.

440
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:40,760
Razor death adder, mouse five. Yeah, don't buy this thing.

441
01:37:44,039 --> 01:38:10,229
Chewie! Did you... What the hell happened? Watch out, Chewie! Whatever the grade! Okay, I'm sorry.

442
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:36,680
To voice Andy. Chewie! Chewie! Chewie! Nice backflip. What do we do? Chewie, what are we

443
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:48,569
supposed to do? New offer. What do you got? Let me see it. Limited time offer. Four dollars off the

444
01:38:48,569 --> 01:38:54,409
debt if you go and do all this shit in the autoexe folder. No. Honestly, I don't even care if that

445
01:38:54,409 --> 01:39:07,739
was like fucking a billion. I wouldn't do it. I don't even care. Four million off the debt. No,

446
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:22,199
that's not enough. He hates us. All right, force press the buttons. Was there nothing actually in

447
01:39:22,199 --> 01:40:01,899
here? In the middle of that, I just saw somebody write, good. That's an evil droid. It was walking

448
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:07,340
around and it had a gun all the way deep into his head and it was gonna come out and just go

449
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:14,199
go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go. How do I know? Because I had the intel. I know

450
01:40:14,199 --> 01:40:25,880
the exact model number and the exact fucking serial code. What? Why am I looking at the cameras?

451
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:55,750
Where the hell are we supposed to go? We have to go like up there? Put on the droid zoom.

452
01:40:55,750 --> 01:41:04,300
Just jump up here? I don't think Chewie can do this. Chewie's not a Jedi. It's kind of annoying

453
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:08,140
that they didn't... They should have eventually. I don't know why they didn't give Chewie a lightsaber

454
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:14,119
eventually. Or like a lightsaber gun. Like he shoots out like beams. Like lightsaber beams with

455
01:41:14,119 --> 01:41:34,180
like the crystals. He deserved it. These computers? I don't... What am I supposed to do? They invented

456
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:50,250
a real lightsaber by the way. Um all right well I'm sure it works. Definitely doesn't. All right,

457
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:57,619
where the hell am I going here? Wrong way. Fuck. Chewie, why can't I just like say go? You go.

458
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:06,520
It does. Yeah it's one of... I'm sure it does. I'm sure it works behind a bunch of like military glass

459
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:20,520
and a high-powered robot holds it and slashes through something. Dude, you suck at games.

460
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:37,239
I didn't tell you. I'm... Look, I'm trying to find the way. Portable. There it is. Found it. Did I?

461
01:42:37,239 --> 01:43:10,779
Yeah, lucky. Do it. Look out Chewie! There's a guy behind that corner! There's quite a few of them

462
01:43:10,779 --> 01:43:25,340
actually. Why we just let them do this? Can you hold them Chewie? I don't know if that's a yes

463
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:34,979
or a no. That sounded like a no. That sounded like a no. That was like a... I don't know. Okay,

464
01:43:34,979 --> 01:44:09,159
you're gone. Chewie in the next rumble. Guaranteed. Use the gun for a little bit. Guns are fun in this

465
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:25,350
game. Pretty cool. I don't hate them. You get to hear that cool Star Wars crunch. All right, what

466
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:51,109
we got? I have to shoot them. Doesn't work? Of course it does. What's that? I heard something.

467
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:02,789
All right, keep going.

468
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:13,939
All right, it's a guy that throws grenades. Cool. How do you not do that to yourself?

469
01:45:14,659 --> 01:45:19,529
So this is just a guy... Okay, he's fucking crazy. Get out. Get out of the room.

470
01:45:21,239 --> 01:46:03,109
Get out of the room. He's crazy. He's not that stupid, is he? What? Heal. Thank you for the

471
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:33,770
reminder. Enemy. Oh, watch out. C-3PO. Get out of the way. R2. Get out of the way, R2. Oh, sorry,

472
01:46:33,770 --> 01:47:09,189
R2. Is it 33? I'm gonna leave him alone. But I'm gonna shock him once just to...

473
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:15,180
I'm gonna just give him supercharged powers. Now he's ultimately charged.

474
01:47:15,899 --> 01:47:18,539
That worked. That's the different on droids. It gives him battery power, guys.

475
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:41,300
You just ruined Star Wars. Are you sure? Are you sure I did? And it wasn't that mouse

476
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:47,380
that just wears pants? Like just wears red shorts and that's it? Are you sure?

477
01:47:48,100 --> 01:48:17,239
Elevator? Yes, we sure are. I heard Ravenclaw. I have one headphone in. Somebody tell me what

478
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:50,279
happened. Oh, shit. Squish him in the elevator. Squish him in the elevator. Get in the elevator

479
01:48:50,279 --> 01:49:27,180
with him. Got it. Got it. Got it. That's a side slash. All right. Now what? In here. Two more,

480
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:56,970
right? Kubaka, get over here. Is he coming to me? Give me another fight right here.

481
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:46,470
No? Oh, no. Down. Okay. Get out of here. Yeah, I knew you. I had to find him. We just go out.

482
01:50:46,470 --> 01:51:07,670
All right. Where's Han Solo? Han. Get this thing started. We gotta move, Han. Put this thing into

483
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:36,140
hyperdrive. We gotta get out of here, Han. Fight speed ahead. There he is. No, that's not. That's

484
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:46,420
Kyle. What the fuck? It was so much room to not have to do that. You could just walk around him.

485
01:51:55,779 --> 01:52:03,560
He's snapping my neck. What's going on? I thought he was just gonna spin and snap my neck.

486
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:46,840
Thanks, Chewie. I got praise from Chewie. Leg attacks. I only jumped 14 times this entire level.

487
01:52:46,840 --> 01:53:06,279
I used lightning more than I jumped. R2? Isn't it R number two? R2? R2.

488
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:15,260
How's your training going? I've been sent on a few errands. Nothing exciting. Same here. I guess

489
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:21,289
that's just how the training works. I thought it was just me. Ever wonder if your master is holding

490
01:53:21,289 --> 01:53:26,569
you back? You know, making sure you don't become too powerful. Oh, evil? Why would you say that?

491
01:53:26,569 --> 01:53:31,689
Evil? Kyle doesn't seem to really foster my talents. I've gone on a couple of missions with

492
01:53:31,689 --> 01:53:36,729
him, but he doesn't let me do any of the really important stuff. Maybe he's observing you, you

493
01:53:36,729 --> 01:53:41,529
know, seeing how you accomplish your missions. I wouldn't worry about it. I'm not so sure.

494
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:47,689
What do you think, Jaden? Well, I- Ready to get back out there? I learned electricity faster than

495
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:53,909
you did. So if you want to be the evil one, you gotta get in line. No, not at all. I'm ready.

496
01:53:53,909 --> 01:54:06,359
Let's go. All right, we got droid recovery, emergency assistance, merchant rescue, merchant

497
01:54:06,359 --> 01:54:13,050
rescue. What's this one? Academy has received a distress call from a merchant ship that crashed

498
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:18,250
on the planet Blengeel. It was pulled out of hyperspace when they crossed paths with an

499
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:25,239
inter- an interdictor cruiser. The Imperials, apparently not wanting their presence known,

500
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:30,779
fired on the merchant ship. The merchants managed to make it to the planet surface and call for

501
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:37,720
help. As far as we know, the planet is uninhabited. This should be an easy assignment. I think you

502
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:42,579
can handle it while Kyle is away with Rosh. Take a shuttle, land at the coordinates of the distress

503
01:54:42,579 --> 01:54:48,970
beacon, and pick up any survivors. Sure thing. All right, we got lightsaber. Oh, hold on. I gotta

504
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:55,850
look at these. Jedi can absorb dark force power, force push, and force pull directed at them. Okay.

505
01:54:55,850 --> 01:55:09,699
Better heal. Mind try- allows Jedi to confuse or misdirect attention. This is just like a defense.

506
01:55:09,699 --> 01:55:17,029
Force jump. Allows Jedi to make a tremendous vertical leap. Okay. Jedi can jump three times

507
01:55:17,029 --> 01:55:21,960
their normal height. Pull certain levels and objects and targeting. Can also pull an enemy.

508
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:31,100
So this just makes it stronger. Use it to get out of a force grip or drain. Jedi can sense people

509
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:42,539
in invisible markers at short range. Okay. 33% faster than normal speed. Lightsaber defense can

510
01:55:42,539 --> 01:55:48,220
deflect projectiles and melee attacks in a small arc directly in front of them. Who cares? It has

511
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:52,380
to break saber locks and parries against other Jedis. Who cares? I'll just go right for the throat.

512
01:55:52,380 --> 01:56:07,399
And a lightsaber flies straight from the player. Okay. Force drain, extra lightning. I think Jedi

513
01:56:07,399 --> 01:56:21,060
can maintain the force lightning for a sustained forward attack. I want the sniper rifle. And this

514
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:31,770
thing is pretty cool. And I'll take the detonators. Here we go. Remember, this is the best mission in

515
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:49,510
the whole game. Okay. Well, I'll take your word for it. Again, we get shot down again. Any of these

516
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:58,739
easy just to like ride a bike to these places. Just land on the planet away from everything and

517
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:07,770
ride a bike. Why fly over everything? Just get one of those- Why do I have to fly over the base?

518
01:57:08,409 --> 01:57:18,010
Hey, you there. Found the force. You've come. This place is-

519
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:30,439
Oh, watch out. We've got worms. Oh, that guy's gone. What was that? They introduced that guy

520
01:57:30,439 --> 01:57:36,199
last seen just to get him killed by a worm. Okay. They even had- Did that guy have a name?

521
01:57:37,319 --> 01:58:03,979
Maybe a merchant ship. I'm not going down there. I can wait this out. That hurt me. He's right behind

522
01:58:03,979 --> 01:58:13,939
me, isn't he? Yeah, he was. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, look at you. Power up. Can I just upgrade that?

523
01:58:13,939 --> 01:58:32,069
What the fuck? Oh, God. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

524
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:47,819
Get up. Should be safe here. All right. Jedi. Jedi, take a look. All right. There's something

525
01:58:47,819 --> 01:58:57,770
in there. I used my Jedi. Take a look to see what was over there. I need a thermal detonator. Hold

526
01:58:57,770 --> 01:59:07,180
on. All right. But how do I get up there? Over here? All right. Jedi, take a look. I got it.

527
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:23,079
What do I do with this? Force pull. Force push. Destroy it. Shock it. Oh, what? Okay. Power

528
01:59:23,079 --> 01:59:53,109
converter. Now, what do I take this? I'm going to go over there? Oh, geez. All right. I got one.

529
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:00,699
New objective. Okay. Point. Now, I got to go get the other one. Where's the other one?

530
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:13,640
I got to go all the way down there. Okay. I'm going. Ow. Use the force. I'm not going to...

531
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:16,520
All right. You know what? I'm just going to say that word so people just think that I messed up

532
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:28,260
and said it accidentally. No, I'm not. Why would I? What? Get up. Where's this next part? Right

533
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:42,520
there. Right here. Ready? Hey. Hey. Oh. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch

534
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:53,560
out. Watch out. Watch out. Just give it to me. I'm not safe here. Just get the other one. I'm

535
02:00:53,560 --> 02:01:05,670
right here. Oh, shit. What? I can't hold more than one. Oh, fuck. I got to move now.

536
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:45,079
Why is it so scary? That's not even... What? Oh, you shitting me. Okay. All right. Go.

537
02:01:45,720 --> 02:02:01,109
Where is it? Over here? I can see you motherfucker. I can see you. I'm safe right here.

538
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:04,699
All right. Get it? We're going to go right back.

539
02:02:04,699 --> 02:02:30,619
Scary. It's very scary. Very scary. All right. I'm almost... Wait. Where are they? Oh, fuck. Go.

540
02:02:30,619 --> 02:02:57,500
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Okay. Two. Put it in. What? I don't have it? Oh, man. There's more than...

541
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:06,489
Okay. This is going to suck. Absolute ass. Where's the next one? All the way down there.

542
02:03:07,289 --> 02:03:21,300
All right. Just go. Go for it. Okay. This is it right here. Where are they?

543
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:49,319
Okay. I can go... We're going to go back. Backwards. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. He's

544
02:03:49,319 --> 02:04:00,789
right behind me. He's right behind me. Oh, my God. I hate that sound. I'm safe right here.

545
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:19,380
Just say it for 500 million off the debt. No. It's not worth it. Yes, it is. Okay. One more.

546
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:33,130
Last one is all the way... I don't know. Where is it? Where's the last one? Oh, shit. It's so far

547
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:48,979
away. What the... Jedi Speed. That's the key is to use the Jedi Speed. I haven't been using it.

548
02:04:49,779 --> 02:05:11,979
I can just run with Jedi Speed on. Don't get cocky. What's that? Shit. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

549
02:05:11,979 --> 02:05:16,810
Stop. Stop. All right. I need to recharge my fucking force.

550
02:05:50,229 --> 02:06:08,810
Okay. I'm fine. It was Morty Muriel. Oh, Rick. All right. I got all four of these.

551
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:23,380
Yeah. This part sucks. Oh, fuck. Don't be stupid here. Wait. Go. Go. Hurry.

552
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:38,630
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh, shit. Oh. Did I save it? No. Idiot. You idiot. Why would

553
02:06:38,630 --> 02:07:09,420
you not... What an idiot. I have... Why... Save it. Quick save. It's one button press. All right. Hold

554
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:19,140
on. Use force kin. There you go. Are you happy? Is everybody here happy now?

555
02:07:33,289 --> 02:07:37,350
I don't want to be in the ground. I don't want to be in the ground. I don't want to be in the

556
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:44,340
ground. There we go. Okay. I'm all right. No deal. I don't even care about the deal. I just

557
02:07:44,340 --> 02:08:23,460
want people to stop writing it. Oh, no. Don't... Holy shit. How did I not get eaten? I got it. Done.

558
02:08:23,939 --> 02:08:34,359
Whatcha doing? Off this crazy rock. I get off this crazy rock. That was it? Sounds like those sand

559
02:08:34,359 --> 02:08:42,659
birds. Holy shit. Nasty critters. Back safe and sound. We'll let Coruscant know to mark it as

560
02:08:42,659 --> 02:08:49,829
hazardous. This is getting more serious. We have been receiving numerous reports of a Sith cult

561
02:08:49,829 --> 02:09:01,819
called the Disciples of Ragnos appearing all over the galaxy. Okay. Emergency assistance or droid

562
02:09:01,819 --> 02:09:10,789
recovery.

563
02:09:41,529 --> 02:09:42,810
All right. Lightning three.

564
02:09:48,020 --> 02:10:02,630
Anything in front of them. Sounds good to me. I want it. This is a droid level so we're gonna

565
02:10:02,630 --> 02:10:11,369
have to go with droid specific items. Okay. Blue milk?

566
02:10:26,949 --> 02:10:28,630
Moisture farmers?

567
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:33,350
Cult. All right. Don't worry. Jawas are pretty friendly.

568
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:38,619
Are they? Every time I've seen a Jawa on in the Star Wars, aren't they like just taking apart

569
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:54,949
robots and like attacking people? You're a fake fan. Am I? Oh, we gotta fight. We gotta fight.

570
02:10:55,750 --> 02:11:26,010
We gotta fight. Jawas versus... Dude, shoot him. Okay. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't... Oh,

571
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:50,979
he just saw that. Don't tell anybody about that. Do it. Oh, now I understand what they mean when

572
02:11:50,979 --> 02:12:02,699
you just have so much power. You just can't help it. You have unlimited power. The dark side is

573
02:12:02,699 --> 02:12:17,289
just too strong. I got electricity in my hands. People can fly in. Holy shit. This feels very,

574
02:12:17,289 --> 02:12:38,579
very good. That... I'm... Oh my god, dude. Sniper! Hey, okay. Oh my fucking...

575
02:12:39,539 --> 02:12:47,239
It doesn't work that way. I just look angry. What the fuck is happening? Oh, this people.

576
02:12:48,199 --> 02:13:03,140
I was like, why am I getting hit when I fire the gun? All right. Jedi mind heal.

577
02:13:25,859 --> 02:13:28,340
Oh, that's a perfect room to just go in there and just go...

578
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:39,100
Ah, that move is unbelievable. This move is incredible.

579
02:13:40,539 --> 02:13:51,579
I'm unstoppable. No one has any chance to beat me. No one. Even the emperor. He can't do this shit.

580
02:13:51,579 --> 02:13:55,739
They should be concerned about me now because I have actually unlimited power with my lightning.

581
02:13:56,460 --> 02:14:04,439
I went all into the lightning. I didn't even train a lightsaber move. I went right for that

582
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:08,920
book in Harry Potter right in the back of that room. I just opened it up. I didn't care about

583
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:15,979
a wand. I don't even have a wand yet. I don't give a shit. Oh, the wand chooses the witch. I

584
02:14:15,979 --> 02:14:21,460
don't care. I don't fucking even want a wand. Don't even give me one. Just give me that book

585
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:41,420
in the back that has like the magic fucked up shit in it. He's mad with power.

586
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:50,810
No, they'd have to make a new house for me. I'd be so strong. You know what I mean? Oh,

587
02:14:50,810 --> 02:15:12,260
you're Gryffindor. Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Jeremy. I sit alone at lunch. I can't even do anything.

588
02:15:12,739 --> 02:15:36,739
Oh my god. You're slaughtering them. I am just... Look. Look. I'm unbeatable. And I'm going to try

589
02:15:36,739 --> 02:15:44,220
to... I'm going to save the galaxy. I just... You find me somebody. You find me the bad guy

590
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:58,149
and just point me at him. You are the bad guy. It's me. You find me the bad guy. Go ahead. Point

591
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:03,270
to him and you say, ah, Jeremy, you should die. That's the bad guy. Well, I have to examine that

592
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:09,819
first and go over what you mean. What did they do? They are trying to rule the galaxy. They're

593
02:16:09,819 --> 02:16:14,869
trying to take over the world and use a Death Star. Okay. All right. Okay. How big is the Death

594
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:31,479
Star? It's as big as an entire planet. All right. I can handle that. Well, I'm not looking for him,

595
02:16:31,479 --> 02:16:45,659
so... Well, now someone's going to be looking for that droid. The guy who owns this house is

596
02:16:45,659 --> 02:17:11,780
going to come out and be like, what the fuck happened to G3PO? Where? Yeah. Okay. In the face,

597
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:28,729
immediately dead. In an instant. Instant one headshot. All you have to do... I would just have

598
02:17:28,729 --> 02:17:34,280
to come in here and hold my hands up. Like out. Forward. I wouldn't have to do any electricity.

599
02:17:35,079 --> 02:17:41,670
I wouldn't have to even hurt anybody. And people would just be like, okay, get out of his way.

600
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:44,790
Get the fuck out of this guy's way. We know what he does. We know who he is.

601
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:59,059
That's fine. That's Jeremy from House Jeremy. Everybody... Just everybody leave. Just leave.

602
02:17:59,059 --> 02:18:17,350
Everyone leave. What does he want? That's great. See? I chose the side of good. I chose the side

603
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:25,100
of good. I keep hearing... Somewhere in my ear. Deeply into my brain. Somewhere. I just keep

604
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:28,700
hearing, do it. I don't know who it is. I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know

605
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:42,700
what they want me to do. But they're in my head. Maybe just a little. Is that what you wanted me to

606
02:18:42,700 --> 02:19:03,299
do? Do that? Do this? Gentlemen? Good to see you, gentlemen. Do it. No, not that one. He's turning

607
02:19:03,299 --> 02:19:13,139
to the dark side. No, I'm not. I can control it. I really wish I had more control to launch them

608
02:19:13,219 --> 02:19:23,209
up over the... Okay, now you... That's all. Just get behind him. Just distract him.

609
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:27,659
Just distract him long enough for somebody to come and just butt him in the head with a rifle.

610
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:37,540
Most powerful being in the universe still has like a soft head. So, you know, I guess that's true.

611
02:19:38,100 --> 02:20:18,040
How do I get up there? No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Come back.

612
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:22,819
Oh, man. When I get up there, I'm going to electrocute whoever's up there. I don't even care.

613
02:20:25,799 --> 02:21:05,579
Oh, let's go. What happened? Oh, no, he's here. I feel like, I feel like they're all running

614
02:21:05,579 --> 02:21:22,299
around going, oh, no, it's, it's Lu Bu. Lu Bu is here. Oh, shit. Everybody get the fuck out of the

615
02:21:22,299 --> 02:21:50,200
way. You didn't see that? He doesn't know. Okay, apparently not. Oh, man. Okay, the party's over.

616
02:21:50,200 --> 02:22:00,780
Party's over. Party's over. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to use a lightsaber.

617
02:22:08,889 --> 02:22:28,520
What am I doing? All right, let me heal. I'm gonna get the full health. I probably should do heal

618
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:38,500
too, right? That just will make it much quicker. All right, that's good. Good enough. Good enough.

619
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:51,610
That's good. Good, good, good, good. Okay. Can I put the lightsaber just away? Is there a sheath?

620
02:22:51,610 --> 02:23:11,319
I don't even want to use it. Let's press one. Okay, lightsaber just kind of gets in the way.

621
02:23:11,959 --> 02:23:32,969
I'll get out of here. All right, what's this open? Think fast. Think fast.

622
02:23:47,719 --> 02:24:06,149
I almost made it. How do I get down there? How do I do that? Oh, my goodness. What should I do?

623
02:24:06,149 --> 02:24:30,180
What do I do? I don't know. Speed. Speed. Oh, you guys all right? I need to save them.

624
02:24:30,819 --> 02:25:02,760
All right, let's go. I did it. I saved you. You are free to go. Look, you can move.

625
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:09,260
I want you to move. I ain't saying it again. The hands come up. Both hands come out forward.

626
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:41,059
I ain't saying it again. Let's go. I'm trying to rescue mission here. Instantly dead. Okay, that's

627
02:25:41,059 --> 02:25:55,559
whatever. No lightsaber. What are you doing? Wasting energy. Is it on timer? I think I've...

628
02:25:55,559 --> 02:26:04,020
Oh, my God. He shot me right in the head. Just... Hey, German. Here's a can of whoop-ass.

629
02:26:06,969 --> 02:26:25,979
Really? Can of whoop-ass. He's stone cold. Actually, German, lightsabers recycle power.

630
02:26:25,979 --> 02:26:35,930
I'm good. And that hurt a lot, but I'm good. All right. What's this link spam? What are you

631
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:42,020
guys doing? What's going on here? German95 debt relief album cover art. German has made

632
02:26:42,659 --> 02:26:46,979
song after song throughout his YouTube and streaming career, whether it be the rat birthday

633
02:26:46,979 --> 02:26:51,459
mixtape, the giant enemy spider, or the banana bro's anthem. He's made musical masterpieces,

634
02:26:51,459 --> 02:26:59,209
but none of these musical masterpieces have been collected in an album. Hopefully after this deal,

635
02:26:59,209 --> 02:27:03,370
that can change. Here below, you can see the price negotiations. We hope you accept Mr.

636
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:10,229
Albertson. Okay. 100 million for covers of a song, 200 million for extended versions of the songs,

637
02:27:10,229 --> 02:27:15,209
300 million for completely new songs, and 1 billion for an official raid song. Okay.

638
02:27:15,209 --> 02:27:23,909
Beat boxes are acceptable. Let me think about this and take the first break of the evening.

639
02:27:23,989 --> 02:30:37,370
I'll be right back. And we're back. Maybe we'll vote on this, maybe, eventually. I'm interested

640
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:50,709
in the deal, but I'm not saying yes to it yet. Hold on. I'm currently being brunt. Come back.

641
02:30:54,040 --> 02:31:05,879
Catboy. Yep. Put on the ears. Look at all this catboy. Catboy, catboy, catboy, this catboy,

642
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:21,860
catboy, this catboy. What did that do? Oh, I turned it off. You can go. Go, go, go. You're good.

643
02:31:21,860 --> 02:31:33,100
Go through. Go through. Hands up. I'm not going to. All right. I just hit him with like the

644
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:49,379
peripheral. Whatever. Don't go that way. That's where fire is. What did I just do? Oh, okay.

645
02:31:49,940 --> 02:32:04,649
Elevator. Where's slug germa? Where's slug germa? Oh shit. Somebody was still alive.

646
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:25,450
Is there a lightning four? Can you do lightning four? I just killed like 10 people. I don't know

647
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:50,420
who's over there. Just guessed. All right. Got him. Lightning 10 is a nuke. Is it? You're okay.

648
02:32:51,139 --> 02:32:55,219
You must be the droid we were sent for, but it doesn't look like there's any jawas left to

649
02:32:55,219 --> 02:33:02,100
negotiate with. Well, I guess you better just follow me. Follow me. All right. Let's go.

650
02:33:02,819 --> 02:33:17,430
Don't go out there. Wait, wait, wait. It's not safe. It's not safe. It's not safe out there.

651
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:31,219
It's not. Now it is. All right. Let's go. Do I even need to be at the academy anymore? I was

652
02:33:31,219 --> 02:33:36,180
starting to get worried. Any problems? Not unless you count the sand people I ran into.

653
02:33:36,899 --> 02:33:53,780
Well, you're still in one piece. This guy with training is not. This is terrifying. Wait, what?

654
02:33:53,780 --> 02:34:30,069
82 people killed? Wait, what do you mean next mission? Next mission? I couldn't. What do you

655
02:34:30,069 --> 02:34:38,809
mean go back to the academy? I only got one more. Officers from the planet Bakura have requested

656
02:34:38,809 --> 02:34:43,209
our assistance. An unknown party is taking control of a power station up in the mountains.

657
02:34:43,209 --> 02:34:48,059
They sent a team to investigate, but they haven't reported in. Their concerns are twofold. They want

658
02:34:48,059 --> 02:34:52,059
to stop whoever has taken over the station, and more importantly, ensure that the station

659
02:34:52,059 --> 02:34:57,930
itself remains undamaged. The station is built over a dormant volcano. And if the facilities

660
02:34:57,930 --> 02:35:02,899
destroy the volcano, it could destroy a heavily populated city. The Bakurans need someone to

661
02:35:02,899 --> 02:35:10,709
infiltrate the facility and thwart the group's plan. Oh, you can skip one mission per set of five.

662
02:35:12,469 --> 02:35:29,590
Should I even do this then? Yes. Okay. All right. So I have lightning. Now I can do force choke.

663
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:39,860
Force grip, drain, lightning. I can't do any more points in the lightning. Force grip.

664
02:35:44,090 --> 02:36:08,979
I think the weapons don't really matter. Okay. Mission five. Oh, how long is this game?

665
02:36:12,409 --> 02:36:29,420
I'm just bored? It's pretty long. It's 50 hours. What the hell are you talking about? Okay. Force

666
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:57,100
powers. We got heal, lightning, grip. That was three. Like 10 hours? Oh, okay. So Kyle's in

667
02:36:57,100 --> 02:37:15,190
trouble then. Kyle, where is this guy? Man. This is where I get into a little bit of trouble because

668
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:19,239
I get bored, right? I go into the side room and there's like a bunch of potions in there,

669
02:37:19,239 --> 02:37:26,250
and I pick one up and I drop it. Stuck in here.

670
02:37:55,579 --> 02:38:14,819
Should I go stop him? Oh, all right. We got to stop the count. What? I'm under arrest? Oh, hi guys.

671
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:49,639
I was testing my new move out and it sucks. I don't have to do anything, man. I'm unbeatable.

672
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:58,040
No one can stop me, even if there's a boss. Who the fuck were you guys? Did you guys spawn

673
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:18,120
in? Press all the buttons. Just press every button on the machine. Who cares? Uh-oh. Hold on.

674
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:23,559
I got to take care of this. The one thing that can stop me is environmental death.

675
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:59,110
Good. Nice. Got it. Watch out for the gas. Easy way to deal with this.

676
02:39:59,829 --> 02:40:15,020
Oops. How did I jump over that? What? I got the security key. Nice. Okay. I'm too powerful.

677
02:40:15,579 --> 02:40:29,690
I became too powerful. Way too powerful. Way too quickly. Oh, it's the bomb. Okay. Wait. Easy.

678
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:34,819
Easy. Bomb. What's the difficulty? I don't think that's going to do anything.

679
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:54,420
Four more to go. Now you need an apprentice. I don't think that works. I can't have an apprentice.

680
02:40:55,139 --> 02:41:07,559
I can't teach somebody how to do this. I'm the only one that can. Should I go back up?

681
02:41:11,909 --> 02:41:20,090
Um, okay. Well, I'm just going back up. What did I come down here for?

682
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:24,459
Jump in the pit for a funny laugh. Okay. That would be really funny, actually.

683
02:41:25,579 --> 02:41:55,479
God damn it, man. Bring it. Let's go. Bring it down. Why do you just want me to cry?

684
02:41:58,389 --> 02:42:20,649
Cry? Oh, cuff me. Cuff me. What was that move? Shit your pants. Shit your pants. All right. So,

685
02:42:20,649 --> 02:42:40,520
I got to go this way. Okay. We'll go over here now. Wait, what? What did I miss?

686
02:42:44,899 --> 02:42:58,889
This is not the Jedi way. I have the security key. Right. Well, I... Oh, why is it all the way down

687
02:42:58,889 --> 02:43:17,299
here? That's a horrible place for that. No lightsaber. What's the lightsaber for, man?

688
02:43:18,020 --> 02:43:25,530
I don't even need it. Who cares? I don't need a lightsaber. Uh-oh. Somebody else with exploding

689
02:43:25,530 --> 02:43:32,700
hands up there, I think. I'm not scared. I'm not concerned about that. Like, you have good power.

690
02:43:32,700 --> 02:44:02,840
You have a power, too. It's for your cosplay. That's right. Too powerful. Too powerful. Fine.

691
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:12,899
I guess I'll use it for a minute or two. What's another cool move to get? All right. Be careful.

692
02:44:12,899 --> 02:44:16,020
Don't be an idiot. I don't want to, like, accidentally blow this up. So, we're going to

693
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:24,180
go from here and go that way. See? I'm careful. Look at how careful I was being. Three more. Three

694
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:39,590
more. This level sucks, to be honest with you. Is this why you guys told me to do this? Everybody's

695
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:54,020
like, do this one. Do this one. Next. Next. Because, you know, this one was bad. Where's this taking

696
02:44:54,020 --> 02:45:09,579
me? You're going to get lost? Oh, I found a secret. What does that mean? Oh, I have the Jedi mind

697
02:45:09,579 --> 02:45:22,819
look. I'll find it eventually. I'm going to stop flirting. Whoa! I almost just got crushed. Sorry.

698
02:45:22,819 --> 02:45:30,780
Stop flirting with chat and play the game. What do you think? I am. All right. This one back here.

699
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:43,049
This is the one I already got. What was the next one? We're going to go, I guess, over here.

700
02:45:43,850 --> 02:45:56,549
I don't even know who... I didn't even know you were there. You weren't even on my radar.

701
02:45:57,110 --> 02:46:15,379
I don't think I can do this one. I can't go from here. Shit. Okay. Well, whatever. Coward. Coward.

702
02:46:15,379 --> 02:46:23,510
Coward. Coward. Force the wall run. Can I get in here with it? I need a key card or something?

703
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:37,340
Well, this is dumb. Can you fart for us? No. Thanks. Is that one up there done, or does that

704
02:46:37,340 --> 02:47:07,180
one need to be done? I need to do that one. I think I can make this elevator and then go up and

705
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:16,709
disarm it. Fart now. Fart now. I'm not... Why do you want me to do that? You guys are gross. Please do

706
02:47:16,709 --> 02:47:30,299
it. Two more. Where are they? Is that one done? I can't tell. Let's get the sniper rifle out.

707
02:47:31,579 --> 02:47:38,680
That one's done. This one's done. That one's done. All right. All three over here are done.

708
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:45,079
Now we go this way. Back over here. All right. Where are the other ones? I only see...

709
02:47:45,799 --> 02:47:57,700
Holy fuck. I thought I fell off. Do a force fart. I don't think I want to do that. A force fart is

710
02:47:57,700 --> 02:48:13,780
just shit your pants. I'm not... No. You don't force. That's what happens. That's a force fart,

711
02:48:13,780 --> 02:49:00,870
and I'm not doing that. Worst noise. No, it wasn't. It was fine. Force puke. No. Force puke in

712
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:13,659
mother's bed. Oh my god. All right. So how can I get in here? This level sucks. This level sucks.

713
02:49:14,219 --> 02:49:35,350
Level sucks. This level sucks. This level sucks. I didn't do this one. No. I did. Where are the

714
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:55,049
other ones? What the fuck? I went in a circle. Yeah. Well, where am I supposed to go? What's the

715
02:49:55,049 --> 02:50:00,170
command to just complete a level? This one's... I don't like this one. I don't want to do this one.

716
02:50:02,629 --> 02:50:16,579
Force just fall off. Soft lock. You're almost done? Yeah, but I can't... How am I supposed to

717
02:50:16,579 --> 02:50:34,420
get out? I don't know where to go. Can I get in there? Look up the guide. Go back through the door.

718
02:50:35,379 --> 02:50:43,139
All right. I'm through the door. And then I can go down this way or I can go back through here.

719
02:50:44,100 --> 02:51:07,270
Back through. Force pretending. No, this brings me down. Force pretending. Forcing a joke. Force

720
02:51:07,270 --> 02:51:36,889
joke. Save it here. Now I can go this way or down. I'm going to try it this way. Down. Okay. Force

721
02:51:36,889 --> 02:51:55,979
look. One up there I got. This one over here which I didn't get. I remember this part. Can't get in

722
02:51:55,979 --> 02:52:12,860
this door. I got that one. I haven't been down there though. Hold on. Kirby air ride waiting room.

723
02:52:18,569 --> 02:52:53,159
I'm not playing that game. Here? In here? In here? What is this thing? Key on corpse.

724
02:52:53,879 --> 02:53:10,120
Key? Where is it? Where is it? This guy? Give me a fucking break. Don't blow it up. I was trying to

725
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:20,729
shoot him. Okay. That opens. Where's that door? It's over here somewhere. I saw it. I ran by it.

726
02:53:20,729 --> 02:53:45,139
Where is it? Where's that door? It's a red door. I can't. I couldn't. There it is. Goodbye. You just

727
02:53:45,139 --> 02:53:58,250
got electrocuted. Oh no. I'm too good at the game now. And even with a high difficulty it wouldn't

728
02:53:58,250 --> 02:54:09,659
even change anything. I can't wait to fight a boss. And just kill the boss instantly. Off a cliff.

729
02:54:23,860 --> 02:54:46,979
Got him. Bomb right there. Now that was fucking cool. Alright. That was really cool. One more.

730
02:54:47,059 --> 02:55:01,000
Only one more. Where is the last one? One final one remains and then I can get the

731
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:34,010
heck out of here. Please. Alright. No? I'm gonna cross this way. Don't go down. Go across.

732
02:55:39,659 --> 02:55:49,180
There it is. There it is. I win. I win. I win. That does it. Better get back to my ship.

733
02:55:49,739 --> 02:56:05,049
Where's the ship? This guy doesn't even do anything.

734
02:56:05,049 --> 02:56:22,020
Where's the ship? Okay. I think it's this way. I feel like I'm hacking.

735
02:56:22,659 --> 02:56:36,309
I put in cheat codes to make the game impossible to lose. You bad? Nope. You're good.

736
02:56:57,079 --> 02:57:10,659
I didn't kill the droid. It just went. It was one little blaster. He's gonna be fine.

737
02:57:11,459 --> 02:57:24,709
Where the hell did I just go? Oh. Come on. No. Get. Level sucks. Level sucks. Level sucks. Level

738
02:57:24,709 --> 02:58:28,540
sucks. Now where the hell do I go? Back this way, right? Move. Move. Move. Bye bye. There's my ship.

739
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:47,719
Force change your difficulty. Stronger than the emperor. By far. He couldn't do this.

740
02:59:01,430 --> 02:59:19,299
Mm-hmm. Uh-oh. Alright. Let's go. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. He's getting concerned?

741
02:59:23,639 --> 02:59:32,899
Jayden, I was looking at how many people you've killed. It's over 50 per mission. Maybe put a

742
02:59:32,899 --> 02:59:37,129
couple points into jump. Maybe into heal.

743
02:59:37,690 --> 02:59:46,709
Relay some disturbing news. Someone sliced into my personal records and accessed some highly

744
02:59:46,709 --> 02:59:51,909
sensitive data about places where I felt a strong connection to the force. Places like Cloud City,

745
02:59:51,909 --> 02:59:58,149
Hoth, and Biss. What could they get from that besides a tour? Something nasty. I believe that

746
02:59:58,149 --> 03:00:03,670
the sceptre Jayden saw was somehow used to drain the residual force power from the Masasi Temple.

747
03:00:03,670 --> 03:00:10,389
Drain the force? How can anyone do that? I'm not sure. But I learned from the Jedi Holocron

748
03:00:10,389 --> 03:00:15,989
that devices were created in the past that could absorb and store force energy. Those people Jayden

749
03:00:15,989 --> 03:00:21,110
saw may have discovered some way to harvest force power with that sceptre. Which could be dangerous

750
03:00:21,110 --> 03:00:28,709
indeed. So what are we going to do? We'll have to investigate any locations from my records.

751
03:00:28,709 --> 03:00:33,989
That includes all of you students. This guy. You're going to wail. Mad eyes. Pissed off eyes.

752
03:00:34,069 --> 03:00:41,799
The valley of the Jedi. It's real action. Who would they be stealing force power?

753
03:00:41,799 --> 03:00:46,819
Sorry too much Jayden. I bet that these cult guys can't take on a Jedi.

754
03:00:46,819 --> 03:00:52,940
Well we're not Jedi yet. We're just students. You may be just students.

755
03:00:52,940 --> 03:00:59,979
We're junior heroes. So don't rush it. Jayden I'm sending you to Hoth where I had a vision of Obi-Wan

756
03:00:59,979 --> 03:01:05,209
Kenobi. Imagine there was a pretty strong aura there. Rosh I'm sending you to the remains of

757
03:01:05,209 --> 03:01:10,969
the planet Byss. It's very remote so I doubt the cult has been there. Don't stay too long.

758
03:01:10,969 --> 03:01:16,340
The imperial remnant may still be operating in the area. No problem. That's everyone then.

759
03:01:16,340 --> 03:01:32,409
May the force be with all of you. And also with you. Call me if you need any help. Let's go.

760
03:01:34,969 --> 03:01:43,670
Investigate the site of Luke's vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Rosh I never heard that is. It's me. That's

761
03:01:43,670 --> 03:02:06,139
not how he talks but whatever. All right I got my electrical amplification device.

762
03:02:08,889 --> 03:02:14,790
Or a giant calculator. I'm not sure which one it is. Or the farting part of a cash register.

763
03:02:21,219 --> 03:02:35,989
Am I giving this the finger? Whatever it is. What is that?

764
03:02:45,510 --> 03:02:49,670
Come here. Come here. I want to get on one of you. Come here.

765
03:02:50,629 --> 03:03:06,100
Get over here. Get over here. I'm just gonna follow the beacons.

766
03:03:21,899 --> 03:03:46,549
Wait what about my friend? I can't just leave him hanging. I can. You want to go?

767
03:03:47,510 --> 03:04:14,040
I don't think you know who you're fucking with here. Do it. You dead? Now you're a little scared.

768
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:26,309
I am the most impossible to destroy being in the universe. You want to taunt? Goodbye. He survived.

769
03:04:26,309 --> 03:04:39,180
He's the chosen one. That's me. I just have to use it for a little bit because it's kind of like a

770
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:44,329
car. Like you got to use your car's battery for it to work otherwise if you don't use it it just

771
03:04:44,329 --> 03:05:10,649
fucking not turn on. So it's gonna use it for a little bit. We're going the right way. I think

772
03:05:10,649 --> 03:05:15,610
it's a whole I think that guy's whole body came off. Come here. I need to I want to get on you.

773
03:05:22,420 --> 03:05:31,819
Somebody there. Someone there. Oh shit an AT-ST. This is the ultimate test of the ultimate power.

774
03:05:42,969 --> 03:06:12,649
Oh shit that's a bad place to save. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Hey you're not

775
03:06:12,649 --> 03:06:49,100
supposed to be over here. Horse hide. Whatever. Saver. Lightsaber. It's my friend. I'm coming.

776
03:06:51,739 --> 03:07:18,280
I can't open it from this side. Stuck in here? Let's go. No one is safe.

777
03:07:19,159 --> 03:07:44,469
No one. Not when I show up. No one is safe. What did that do? Secret. Oh a secret area. Cool.

778
03:07:45,110 --> 03:08:06,229
Grenades. Food. Health. What did that button press do? I don't know. I'm not sure.

779
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:21,450
He just summoned Boba Fett. He did? Oh no. How do I fight him? How am I ever going to beat him?

780
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:53,559
What door today is open? Down? How will I ever beat Boba Fett? He's going to show up and he's

781
03:08:53,559 --> 03:09:36,340
going to have a rocket launcher. It's going to be impossible. Massacre. The little toaster bot.

782
03:09:36,420 --> 03:09:45,270
Wait. I have to kill the toaster. All right. You get to live. You get to live. You get to live.

783
03:09:46,149 --> 03:10:03,500
Not yet. What the fuck do you think you're going to do? The boss is not going to have

784
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:11,780
any time to even do his monologue. Right now the boss has seized the cameras here and he's just like

785
03:10:11,780 --> 03:10:17,219
oh shit. Shuffling papers. My fucking speech. Hold on. I wasn't ready for this.

786
03:10:18,819 --> 03:10:24,260
How dare you enter my domain without asking and without express permission in my restaurant.

787
03:10:25,139 --> 03:10:46,149
I'm scared. I didn't have time to memorize my lines. Oh cool. Oh nice. I don't even need to use it.

788
03:10:48,569 --> 03:11:09,430
Who needs the super cannon? I cannot be stopped. Follow the beacons.

789
03:11:13,700 --> 03:11:32,860
This guy's just running through. This is fucking terrifying. Beacon. Follow the beacons. I'm just

790
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:50,809
playing battlefront 2 and I get to randomly get to be one of the heroes. I'm having lots of fun.

791
03:11:51,530 --> 03:12:03,690
Oh did they get in? I don't know man. Maybe there's a secret entrance somewhere. I'll use my force

792
03:12:03,690 --> 03:12:46,569
look. I don't see anything. You guys see something? I don't see anything. Maybe around the back? What

793
03:12:46,569 --> 03:12:55,299
do you guys think? In the comments of this video you tell me what you think I should look. I'm

794
03:12:55,299 --> 03:13:25,000
thinking maybe up top. What do you think? I don't know what to do. We get 5k likes. They literally

795
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:34,840
told you to get in the AT-AT. They did? I'm sorry I was too busy killing everything and having no

796
03:13:34,840 --> 03:14:08,569
contest. Where's the AT-AT? Get in there. What do you think? I'm trying to find one. There it is.

797
03:14:09,209 --> 03:14:48,809
Get in this? I can't get in it. It's shooting at you? Hey! Getting sniped. Yeah whatever.

798
03:14:48,809 --> 03:15:09,690
All right I'm safe right here. Relax. Recharge. Heal. Recharge. Heal. 500 million off the dead

799
03:15:09,690 --> 03:15:30,969
if you stop using the lightning. You may as well stop playing the game. Something exploded behind

800
03:15:30,969 --> 03:15:37,860
us. I have no idea what it was. All right I gotta get in here. Do I get in? Oh shit. All right. All

801
03:15:37,860 --> 03:15:50,489
right. All right. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Get in. When I get in there you're

802
03:15:50,489 --> 03:16:44,620
gonna get electrocuted dude. Why can I not just get in here? Shoot. I tried. I tried. I tried to do

803
03:16:44,620 --> 03:17:19,260
it like five times. I had to do it in first person apparently. All right now what? What's the difficulty

804
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:25,940
if I like watching winners not losers? It's on normal difficulty just because I picked the really

805
03:17:25,940 --> 03:17:35,100
strong dark side move. I can't play the dark side character. It's the most powerful in the universe

806
03:17:35,100 --> 03:18:11,639
but you are a bad guy. This is a lesson to all of you. All right what's the new objective? That's

807
03:18:11,639 --> 03:18:31,899
kind of fun. Right in the head. They were just heating up by the space heater. I kind of feel bad

808
03:18:31,899 --> 03:18:39,989
about that one but I mean this is the this is the empire. This is the evil empire. What? So the evil

809
03:18:39,989 --> 03:18:49,479
empire can't be destroyed by another evil empire? What are you trying to say? Look I I might be evil

810
03:18:49,479 --> 03:18:53,719
but they're evil too. It's evil versus evil right now. You don't have there there's no somebody

811
03:18:53,719 --> 03:19:05,909
nobody would rather win. It's just bad guy versus bad guy. There is no good guy right now. You press

812
03:19:05,909 --> 03:19:39,260
M. Discover what the imperials are doing in echo base. I'm not gonna do it. Don't worry. I don't

813
03:19:39,260 --> 03:20:00,790
even need a health pack. I have free health. Hi guys. Oh you lived. Look at you. You lived. Not for

814
03:20:00,790 --> 03:20:14,860
long. What's next? How you doing? Research? Cool. I'm not you get to live because you remind me of

815
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:21,860
an old pepsi bottle. You're an old like crystal pepsi. You get to live. Or do you because crystal

816
03:20:21,860 --> 03:20:57,059
pepsi was fucking gross. Can I just go up here? Pure evil. Unlimited power. Unlimited power but

817
03:20:57,059 --> 03:21:02,420
still can't figure out how to fucking leave a base. Sense of direction. Awful. Don't matter.

818
03:21:03,379 --> 03:21:16,139
IQ. Horrible. Doesn't matter. None of that matters. All that matters is power. Power.

819
03:21:16,139 --> 03:21:24,840
But he's he's he's an idiot. You think that matters? Look what's happening. What matters right now?

820
03:21:26,010 --> 03:21:43,420
Power. Total power. And then we hide. We hide because I don't have any power left.

821
03:21:43,899 --> 03:22:00,379
Oh it's starting to affect me a little. I think too much electricity is starting to affect me. My

822
03:22:00,379 --> 03:22:06,700
hair is standing on end. This guy would be running through the halls with this huge static electricity

823
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:18,409
here. Burnt like ears. His clothes he'd have like burnt singed ends of all of his t-shirts and shit.

824
03:22:19,370 --> 03:22:32,069
Yeah like Marv and Home Alone. Just imagine Marv and Home Alone running around with a cloak on.

825
03:22:32,629 --> 03:22:41,239
Oh too many computers in here. I can't do this.

826
03:23:31,049 --> 03:23:36,760
What? I didn't even save the game. I didn't think I was ever going to need to.

827
03:23:37,479 --> 03:24:01,670
He just cut me in half. I was on low battery. Crazed electrocutor. Oh shit. Made the same mistake.

828
03:24:01,670 --> 03:24:14,120
I went the wrong way. How? No I didn't. Get back down here. Choke him. Get over here. I can't be.

829
03:24:14,120 --> 03:25:15,540
Like that was embarrassing. Crystal Pepsi. Stop. Hey. Stop. Stop. Stop. You can't fight me.

830
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:37,479
You can't stop me. You can't stop the Jedi's. I'm not even a Jedi. Here we go. Wait. Bad entrance.

831
03:25:52,780 --> 03:26:25,270
You know I wish there was just a punch. Okay here we go. Oh my god. He's trying to like block them

832
03:26:25,270 --> 03:26:46,860
and just leave. What happened? How did he do that? Don't even matter. I'm killing this guy in one

833
03:26:46,860 --> 03:27:04,069
head. One earbud Andy. Don't matter. Unlimited power. Go ahead. One, two, three. I gotta get out

834
03:27:04,069 --> 03:27:07,860
of the way. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Man you gotta

835
03:27:07,860 --> 03:27:10,819
get out of the way. He's way more powerful than me and if he's way more powerful than me then we

836
03:27:10,819 --> 03:27:59,899
both gotta fucking run man. We are. Fuck. Are you this? This isn't good. I better find this Elora.

837
03:28:00,940 --> 03:28:31,190
Get dunked on. I win. Get out of the way fucking abominable snowman. Yes master. Dagobah.

838
03:28:31,750 --> 03:28:36,469
Skywalker didn't mention it in his journals. He must have been trying to protect something.

839
03:28:37,350 --> 03:28:49,219
Uh oh. It's the apprentice. Not lightning wielding. I don't even use that thing.

840
03:28:54,420 --> 03:29:06,200
I'm also 30. All right you want to go motherfucker? Oh nice job. You're dealing

841
03:29:06,200 --> 03:29:29,719
with a lightning user. Ow. Eat that power. Oh shit you're doing evil laugh or yeah I'm kind of evil

842
03:29:29,719 --> 03:29:39,260
too. I could I'll pull it. I'm the fucking evil one. You're not evil. I don't want I don't want

843
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:43,340
that. What if you have any hand? I don't want it. No stop giving it to me. I don't want it. I don't

844
03:29:43,340 --> 03:29:54,149
want what you have. What do you I I don't what do you want? Hey let's talk. You and I should probably

845
03:29:55,620 --> 03:30:00,899
I'm evil too. All right I'm the fucking evil one of the story. I'm looking on the lightsaber

846
03:30:00,899 --> 03:30:17,860
shit all over me. No no you're weak. You piece of shit. Look what do you want anyways? What do you

847
03:30:17,860 --> 03:30:27,450
want with all you with the empire? Like how about this? You're strong. I'm strong. I know I'm way

848
03:30:27,450 --> 03:30:31,930
stronger than you but make could be one of let's just you play dice and see who can win this.

849
03:30:31,930 --> 03:30:48,729
Maybe we should team up or something. Yeah and I I've won every fight I've ever fought. How about

850
03:30:48,729 --> 03:31:00,489
you? How many fights have you won? That's how you win every fight. I'm gonna get in the dumpster.

851
03:31:02,360 --> 03:31:10,360
Will you come in the dumpster with me? Get in here. This is where we're gonna have our

852
03:31:10,360 --> 03:31:20,120
this is we're gonna have our our meeting. Get in the meeting. I want to get in here. Get in the

853
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:28,280
dumpster. We're having a dumpster evil dumpster meeting. Please humor me. Thank you. Okay so

854
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:34,979
first thing. Well now biggest fucking debate in the book. Now you're stuck in there.

855
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:51,379
Now you gotta listen to me. Yeah. Oh extra bounce on that one.

856
03:32:07,829 --> 03:32:20,309
Oh shit it's a wall. What happened? Oh no.

857
03:32:28,020 --> 03:32:34,549
Everybody just relax. I'm pretending to be dead. This wasn't going anywhere. Just everybody relax.

858
03:32:35,190 --> 03:32:37,989
When she leaves I'm gonna get up and we can just go to the fridge and get a snack and shit.

859
03:32:39,270 --> 03:32:56,309
Should I hold my breath? I think she'll be able to see my chest moving. I have to cough so

860
03:32:56,309 --> 03:33:02,979
bad. I'm gonna sneeze. Fuck I'm gonna sneeze and she's gonna execute me. She's gonna fucking

861
03:33:02,979 --> 03:33:26,860
execute me. Where is this? This is a bad save. Wait where the fuck is this? Where is this? Way to go.

862
03:33:30,860 --> 03:33:38,059
Way to go Darth Ron. Holy shit this is a horrible save. Why do I have it so far back here?

863
03:33:51,879 --> 03:34:09,030
Low checkpoint. He's swinging at me. That was stupid. That was really dumb.

864
03:34:09,030 --> 03:34:26,659
I sneeze. I'm not allowed to sneeze. Remember this part. Look out. Oh I didn't mean to um

865
03:34:27,909 --> 03:34:41,700
am I up? What the hell just happened? Can you? Can I get you to follow me down here? What if I bring

866
03:34:41,700 --> 03:34:58,780
a giant like abominable snowman friend? Oh my oh my god you made it in. Oh my god you made it in.

867
03:34:59,940 --> 03:35:13,209
Oh my god you made it in. Come on come on come on. You don't fit. Okay what if I put a grenade

868
03:35:13,209 --> 03:35:38,629
behind him? Whatever. Here we go. Yep yep yep yep yep yep yep. I know. I don't know how to use one

869
03:35:38,629 --> 03:36:09,290
of these things. Nice block. I have an idea. This is just crazy enough to work. I'm gonna get her

870
03:36:09,290 --> 03:36:15,510
shit stuck in a wall and I'm gonna unload a machine gun into her face. So throw that at me,

871
03:36:15,510 --> 03:36:58,520
get it stuck in a wall. Do I actually kill her? It's gotta be the dumpster. We'll meet again.

872
03:37:02,409 --> 03:37:06,860
Two eight-year-olds. I can't wait.

873
03:37:24,010 --> 03:37:26,409
Sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint. Push him in the back as hard as I can out the window.

874
03:37:26,409 --> 03:37:28,889
You must have already taken the force energy from there.

875
03:37:28,889 --> 03:37:32,840
Just as others have reported. Coruscant? Everywhere.

876
03:37:32,840 --> 03:37:38,010
Biss.

877
03:37:38,010 --> 03:37:42,090
Rosh hasn't returned. He's long overdue and we haven't heard from him.

878
03:37:43,079 --> 03:37:49,079
Link link link. I sense he's still alive. I'm going to Biss to look for him.

879
03:37:50,120 --> 03:38:00,729
Hold on I can't. I'll see what I can find out. Very well. What about me? Rosh is my friend.

880
03:38:00,729 --> 03:38:05,450
You can help by staying here and completing your training. Kyle's right. There are still

881
03:38:05,450 --> 03:38:09,450
missions for you to undertake and we can't neglect the training of one of our most promising

882
03:38:09,450 --> 03:38:16,200
students. Promising? Yes. Due to your heroics on Hoth, we are promoting you to apprentice.

883
03:38:18,620 --> 03:38:25,959
Thank you master Skywalker. Master-

884
03:38:25,959 --> 03:38:32,139
New style, fast style. It's a short and quick style.

885
03:38:32,860 --> 03:38:36,420
Master Skywalker and Master Katarn have left the academy.

886
03:38:36,420 --> 03:38:39,399
They've been instructed to provide you with a set of possible missions.

887
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:46,219
Rescue, meet contact, covert operation, capture the crime lord, or investigate.

888
03:38:46,219 --> 03:38:48,950
Now let me take a look at this link.

889
03:38:53,190 --> 03:38:58,870
No more reload Randy. Time for Sith Andy. A truly powerful Sith lord never dies. To prove your power,

890
03:38:58,870 --> 03:39:02,329
10 million will be added to the debt each time you reload a quicksave.

891
03:39:02,329 --> 03:39:15,110
But what do I get? I get nothing.

892
03:39:20,540 --> 03:39:22,780
No more reload Randy. Time for Sith Andy.

893
03:39:24,260 --> 03:39:25,780
My Sith lord never dies.

894
03:39:28,760 --> 03:39:32,790
No deal. This is just bad for me.

895
03:39:33,350 --> 03:39:43,159
That fucking Harry Potter outfit with the lightsaber. Like what the fuck.

896
03:39:46,860 --> 03:39:52,170
School recess. All mushed into one guy in front of the green screen.

897
03:39:52,809 --> 03:40:05,510
No deal. Which one of these is fun? Which one- from those of you that have played this,

898
03:40:05,510 --> 03:40:08,469
which is a good one? Capture the crime lord.

899
03:40:10,180 --> 03:40:15,700
Covert operation. I will do crime lord first.

900
03:40:16,420 --> 03:40:20,489
We've received anonymous information that a large number of assassin droids have flooded

901
03:40:20,489 --> 03:40:24,260
the black market recently. These droids have been banned for a number of years,

902
03:40:24,260 --> 03:40:26,500
and no public companies produce them.

903
03:40:27,860 --> 03:40:33,639
Lenek Rakdo, a small-time crime lord on Crusant, is suspected to be manufacturing these droids.

904
03:40:33,639 --> 03:40:37,319
Capture Rakdo so that maybe we can get- we can interrogate him.

905
03:40:37,319 --> 03:40:43,420
We should be able to handle this no problem. Thugs like Rakdo are intimidated by the sight

906
03:40:43,420 --> 03:40:50,299
of a lightsaber.

907
03:40:50,299 --> 03:41:04,170
Okay. Force choke. Need to get Hewl.

908
03:41:07,510 --> 03:41:16,299
Did you think you could just barge in here and take me into custody, Jedi?

909
03:41:16,940 --> 03:41:22,840
That's gonna cost him a lot of money to fix.

910
03:41:23,639 --> 03:41:30,100
I feel like this is- by the way, you could have just like hid behind a dresser or something.

911
03:41:30,739 --> 03:41:51,500
He just hears that while closing the door. He's just like, what just happened out there?

912
03:41:51,500 --> 03:41:56,620
Alright, so just get in the X-Wing, fly, park on the roof of this building.

913
03:41:56,620 --> 03:42:00,250
I have an X-Wing. This should not be a problem for me.

914
03:42:00,889 --> 03:42:24,040
Just fly and land somewhere else. I don't want to even- don't add- don't- I didn't agree to that.

915
03:42:24,040 --> 03:42:27,829
I didn't agree to that. You did not- I did not agree to that.

916
03:42:28,309 --> 03:42:35,639
Where am I supposed to go? Too bad. No, that's not fair.

917
03:42:38,569 --> 03:42:41,610
Gain access to the office building. Alright, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?

918
03:42:54,440 --> 03:43:00,860
This sucks.

919
03:43:19,319 --> 03:43:22,200
Alright, make the jump in. Three, two, one, jump.

920
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:32,680
Jump. I have a question for all you Star Wars fanatics.

921
03:43:34,340 --> 03:43:40,760
Is lightning- is the- is lightning just absolute dark side?

922
03:43:41,319 --> 03:43:45,479
If you learn how to shoot lightning out of your hands, you're bad.

923
03:43:49,530 --> 03:43:54,579
No, so when who cares? Good guys can do it too. So why don't good guys do it all the time?

924
03:44:04,090 --> 03:44:09,379
Because it's evil. Kit Fisto used a lot of force lightning.

925
03:44:09,379 --> 03:44:19,530
Yeah, so what's the problem then? It's emotion.

926
03:44:24,229 --> 03:44:27,579
For me? For me, that's right.

927
03:44:28,139 --> 03:44:33,290
They were just announcing that they were the target practice.

928
03:44:33,290 --> 03:44:51,370
Oh, can I get a new lightsaber style? Yeah, this is it. I'm using it right now.

929
03:44:51,370 --> 03:45:05,100
What are some of the dark side moves? What actually quantifies the dark side?

930
03:45:05,819 --> 03:45:07,979
You've got the lightning, you've got the choke you.

931
03:45:10,549 --> 03:45:16,229
Choking and lightning. Force gas lighting.

932
03:45:18,100 --> 03:45:24,260
Holy shit, good aim. Force drain.

933
03:45:24,819 --> 03:45:54,870
Oh my- where the fuck did you come from? Force push.

934
03:45:54,870 --> 03:45:58,709
No, that's a good- that's a good guy move. I see Anakin does that all the time.

935
03:45:59,590 --> 03:46:18,180
Obi-Wan does that all the time. Real drain.

936
03:46:18,739 --> 03:46:34,329
Oh, you're still alive? You know, just kill that fucking guy, seriously.

937
03:46:35,049 --> 03:46:54,170
All right, from here, there's this guy right here. Drop that shield.

938
03:46:54,170 --> 03:47:09,370
All right, dead. And from here we go- I have no idea.

939
03:47:09,370 --> 03:47:16,340
Over there? Watch out for the wrist rockets.

940
03:47:16,340 --> 03:47:32,219
All right, sometimes you gotta pull like a gun and not just be a coward of lightning.

941
03:47:32,219 --> 03:47:34,229
And then sometimes you put the lightning back in.

942
03:47:35,590 --> 03:47:39,590
Watch out for wrist rockets. Watch out for wrist ro- I don't know why.

943
03:47:48,790 --> 03:47:50,389
Super battle droid, knock him down.

944
03:47:50,389 --> 03:48:13,020
That guy went further than anybody ever went. Watch those wrist- wait, is that like a Mandalorian

945
03:48:13,020 --> 03:48:17,340
thing? Because he has like the- he's the wrist shooter that goes pew pew pew.

946
03:48:42,969 --> 03:48:46,489
What the fuck, dude? Did I just die by my own lightsaber?

947
03:48:46,489 --> 03:48:51,530
No, no, no. What happened? Have I not- did I not- why did- how is it possible I didn't save it?

948
03:48:52,659 --> 03:48:57,059
It's impossible that I didn't save it. That's actually not even fucking possible.

949
03:48:57,620 --> 03:49:14,700
Did I get a checkpoint? I don't think I did.

950
03:49:17,209 --> 03:49:21,940
Cry, cry, cry. That's so annoying. What the hell?

951
03:49:22,819 --> 03:49:25,139
How is it possible- I don't even- don't even fight anybody.

952
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:28,940
Just give it back to where I was. All right, I'll kill these guys.

953
03:49:40,420 --> 03:49:45,530
Ooh, that hurt. You gonna cry?

954
03:49:46,649 --> 03:49:50,010
No, sit up. No, I'm not.

955
03:49:51,209 --> 03:50:11,530
I'm gonna do laundry tonight. Fuck.

956
03:50:12,649 --> 03:50:28,010
I'm gonna do laundry tonight? Fuck.

957
03:50:28,010 --> 03:50:31,049
You guys know what that's like, doing laundry, laundry day.

958
03:50:32,010 --> 03:50:47,770
It's like six hours. All right, we're almost at the office building.

959
03:50:49,290 --> 03:50:53,139
Jump. Can I fly this? This looks flyable, doesn't it?

960
03:50:53,700 --> 03:50:56,520
Oh, that's unfortunate. It looks flyable.

961
03:50:57,239 --> 03:51:15,620
I remember just laundry every six months.

962
03:51:15,620 --> 03:51:21,959
No? I'm just saying, when you have a lot of load to do, it takes a while.

963
03:51:24,969 --> 03:51:26,729
It's not something that just happens in like two minutes.

964
03:51:27,450 --> 03:51:40,340
It didn't hit these two? Jedi Master.

965
03:51:40,340 --> 03:52:03,129
Jedi. How big is- no, it's that stupid shield. It's so strong.

966
03:52:12,170 --> 03:52:24,360
All right, keep going. Now from here, go this way.

967
03:52:24,360 --> 03:52:30,420
Save, save, save. He's upset that his move doesn't instantly beat the game for him.

968
03:52:37,959 --> 03:52:41,399
Not instantly, but speedily. I made it.

969
03:52:41,399 --> 03:52:50,420
Okay, let's go. Where is he? I don't know who said that, but is it you?

970
03:52:51,139 --> 03:52:56,459
Is that a Jedi? Hey, look out.

971
03:52:58,299 --> 03:53:06,649
You say that's my third Jedi I've killed this week?

972
03:53:09,100 --> 03:53:19,079
That's my third Jedi this week.

973
03:53:21,930 --> 03:53:33,180
Cocky, all right. How do you like it?

974
03:53:33,180 --> 03:53:36,219
Yeah, don't like it. Okay, don't like it, do you?

975
03:53:36,940 --> 03:53:43,459
So it's a line of sight thing, right? You can't choke what you can't see.

976
03:53:44,340 --> 03:54:01,799
I'll just kill your friend. Oh my fucking God, did I seriously get over it?

977
03:54:02,200 --> 03:54:04,200
Did you kill me in one swing? Are you kidding me?

978
03:54:36,700 --> 03:54:46,500
You see? I need full health going in here.

979
03:54:50,229 --> 03:54:57,860
Or at least close to it. Full health and full Jedi meter.

980
03:54:57,860 --> 03:55:12,059
Seriously shooting at me? I did not drop the difficulty.

981
03:55:12,700 --> 03:55:17,670
I'm waiting for the Jedi meter to charge. Here we go.

982
03:55:17,670 --> 03:55:31,379
No more messing around. Yeah, yeah. All it took was one.

983
03:55:33,180 --> 03:55:41,659
What? He did- I did not change the difficulty. It's the same one it was.

984
03:55:48,360 --> 03:55:49,959
Show the difficulty. I will.

985
03:55:53,180 --> 03:56:01,579
Look. Setup. Video. Options. I don't even know where to show that.

986
03:56:01,579 --> 03:56:04,899
I can't even show that. It's not on easy.

987
03:56:09,579 --> 03:56:13,340
It's not on easy. It's not on easy. I swear to God.

988
03:56:13,340 --> 03:56:24,629
I promise. I didn't- It's not on easy, I promise.

989
03:56:25,350 --> 03:56:29,930
Next person to accuse me of this is gonna get tamed out for like fuck 10 seconds.

990
03:56:53,209 --> 03:57:00,260
In his cube. And then somebody's shooting at me from outside.

991
03:57:00,819 --> 03:57:08,629
Wait, wait, wait, wait, get away from me.

992
03:57:09,590 --> 03:57:14,940
It's one. Three diamonds? I'll take them.

993
03:57:31,180 --> 03:57:39,559
Two down. Did someone just call me Jerma Andy?

994
03:57:40,280 --> 03:57:43,979
Did I read that wrong?

995
03:58:07,420 --> 03:58:08,780
What would I do in this scenario?

996
03:58:14,340 --> 03:58:15,379
I would throw him out the window.

997
03:58:17,459 --> 03:58:22,180
Nice.

998
03:58:26,819 --> 03:58:29,340
Uh oh. All right. Covert operation time.

999
03:58:31,399 --> 03:58:33,079
Sneak around. There's something going on on this planet.

1000
03:58:44,739 --> 03:58:51,100
Or script three. Sounds pretty good to me.

1001
03:58:51,100 --> 03:59:01,899
So I can hold him and smash him into stuff?

1002
03:59:11,799 --> 03:59:14,680
Show the difficulty. I will after this mission.

1003
03:59:15,639 --> 03:59:17,639
Don't think they expected us to find it.

1004
03:59:17,639 --> 03:59:20,469
Targeting computer will lock on kids.

1005
03:59:20,469 --> 03:59:23,350
Place them on key structural points then get out of there fast.

1006
03:59:23,350 --> 03:59:23,989
Oh, this sucks.

1007
03:59:23,989 --> 03:59:25,909
I'll be flying in lasers blazing.

1008
03:59:25,909 --> 03:59:27,350
If everything goes as planned,

1009
03:59:27,350 --> 03:59:29,670
we'll have the defenses down before they know what hit them.

1010
03:59:30,309 --> 03:59:33,909
This mission sucks. I already know.

1011
03:59:33,909 --> 03:59:35,909
Okay, Jaden. Start with the shield generator.

1012
03:59:35,909 --> 03:59:37,909
Otherwise, this will be a short mission.

1013
03:59:37,909 --> 03:59:50,219
I don't want to play this one. How do I get in?

1014
04:00:07,459 --> 04:00:14,549
Wait, what? Is he shooting at me?

1015
04:00:14,549 --> 04:00:22,520
Wait, I don't understand. Get over here.

1016
04:00:22,520 --> 04:00:27,270
Oh my god. I can slam their heads into stuff.

1017
04:00:27,270 --> 04:00:34,569
Hold on. One sec.

1018
04:00:39,180 --> 04:00:40,540
I promise it's not on easy.

1019
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:47,979
I think he did. He shot his friend.

1020
04:00:49,799 --> 04:01:21,530
I didn't. What's he doing? Did I get him?

1021
04:01:33,159 --> 04:01:33,719
Monster.

1022
04:01:54,180 --> 04:01:55,540
They stole this from Gmod.

1023
04:01:56,420 --> 04:02:07,420
I know. Oh, I know. I can do this.

1024
04:02:07,420 --> 04:02:12,540
Oh, cool. I think it broke his neck.

1025
04:02:12,540 --> 04:02:25,899
Back up or does it go down?

1026
04:02:36,579 --> 04:02:53,370
I can throw these guys. Come here.

1027
04:02:53,370 --> 04:02:53,930
Get in here.

1028
04:02:56,790 --> 04:02:59,030
Okay, is he gonna? No, no, no, no.

1029
04:02:59,909 --> 04:03:12,920
He's still alive. Holy shit.

1030
04:03:47,270 --> 04:03:47,590
Clear.

1031
04:04:05,350 --> 04:04:07,209
I don't think I got off.

1032
04:04:10,250 --> 04:04:10,889
Okay, you got it.

1033
04:04:12,329 --> 04:04:13,209
You can go into the hangar.

1034
04:04:13,770 --> 04:04:17,430
Go difficulty now. I can't show the difficulty.

1035
04:04:18,149 --> 04:04:20,309
I have to start a new game to show the difficulty.

1036
04:04:21,190 --> 04:04:22,389
You can't change the difficulty.

1037
04:04:31,450 --> 04:04:33,290
That should weaken their resistance.

1038
04:04:33,290 --> 04:04:37,500
Up here into the garrison.

1039
04:04:40,440 --> 04:04:42,040
Open. Oh, come on. Really?

1040
04:04:42,680 --> 04:04:46,469
How do I get up there?

1041
04:04:47,030 --> 04:05:01,899
Jump on the frame?

1042
04:05:02,780 --> 04:05:05,319
The difficulty shows in the save menu. Does it?

1043
04:05:05,879 --> 04:05:06,950
What did I just do?

1044
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:08,790
I pressed what button did I press?

1045
04:05:11,350 --> 04:05:13,590
Oh my fucking god, dude. I pressed F9.

1046
04:05:13,590 --> 04:05:15,829
I don't know why I pressed F9. I don't know what happened.

1047
04:05:17,590 --> 04:05:18,389
Did I save it at all?

1048
04:05:19,110 --> 04:05:21,909
What was quick quick load was what?

1049
04:05:30,940 --> 04:05:31,739
I pressed F9.

1050
04:05:32,940 --> 04:05:33,579
Oh, no.

1051
04:05:34,379 --> 04:05:49,850
This facility is lightly defended.

1052
04:05:49,850 --> 04:05:52,010
I don't think they expected us to find it.

1053
04:05:52,010 --> 04:05:53,930
My targeting computer will lock on to your.

1054
04:06:04,200 --> 04:06:05,770
I hit F9.

1055
04:06:06,569 --> 04:06:10,520
I don't know why I pressed F9.

1056
04:06:10,520 --> 04:06:13,719
I just wanted to show the stupid difficulty.

1057
04:06:17,590 --> 04:06:19,030
Can I go back to the base?

1058
04:06:20,760 --> 04:06:21,719
Can I go back to the base?

1059
04:06:21,719 --> 04:06:25,219
I don't want to do this one yet.

1060
04:06:25,219 --> 04:06:26,579
I don't want to do this one.

1061
04:06:26,579 --> 04:06:39,559
I just hit M moves.

1062
04:06:43,559 --> 04:06:44,059
No.

1063
04:06:49,079 --> 04:06:49,639
Speed.

1064
04:06:49,639 --> 04:06:50,280
Go fast.

1065
04:06:51,000 --> 04:07:02,120
Go back to the previous save.

1066
04:07:02,120 --> 04:07:03,719
Finish that mission and skip this one.

1067
04:07:03,719 --> 04:07:05,079
What a good fucking idea that is.

1068
04:07:09,459 --> 04:07:10,950
Wait.

1069
04:07:10,950 --> 04:07:12,309
No, that goes way too far back.

1070
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:52,170
I was one plus space.

1071
04:07:59,500 --> 04:08:00,000
Nice.

1072
04:08:12,680 --> 04:08:13,799
He's alive still.

1073
04:08:33,500 --> 04:08:34,299
Get out of here.

1074
04:08:34,299 --> 04:08:35,020
You're nothing to me.

1075
04:08:45,030 --> 04:08:45,510
Where do I go?

1076
04:09:01,739 --> 04:09:02,860
Save, save, save, save.

1077
04:09:02,860 --> 04:09:03,360
I did it.

1078
04:09:18,149 --> 04:09:20,649
Press the lightsab in the press one while it's flying.

1079
04:09:35,510 --> 04:09:38,389
Do the doi version?

1080
04:09:49,500 --> 04:09:50,760
Is that what you wanted?

1081
04:09:51,479 --> 04:10:11,180
Do doi version of duel of fates.

1082
04:10:15,899 --> 04:10:23,180
Do doi version of duel of fates.

1083
04:10:23,180 --> 04:10:26,090
Okay.

1084
04:10:27,030 --> 04:10:27,430
Now what?

1085
04:10:46,459 --> 04:10:47,180
What is that from?

1086
04:10:48,700 --> 04:10:51,020
Oh my god, what's that from?

1087
04:10:51,020 --> 04:10:51,579
That scream.

1088
04:10:52,379 --> 04:10:53,750
What the hell is it from?

1089
04:10:58,420 --> 04:11:00,500
No, no, no, not Tom and Jerry.

1090
04:11:00,500 --> 04:11:01,139
Not Wilhelm.

1091
04:11:08,920 --> 04:11:09,719
What is it from?

1092
04:11:12,250 --> 04:11:13,129
No, not Howie.

1093
04:11:13,770 --> 04:11:14,809
It's very specific.

1094
04:11:18,840 --> 04:11:19,340
Shit.

1095
04:11:23,479 --> 04:11:24,040
Bop it.

1096
04:11:24,040 --> 04:11:24,360
Bop it.

1097
04:11:24,360 --> 04:11:25,000
You got it.

1098
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:25,719
Yes, somebody got it.

1099
04:11:25,719 --> 04:11:26,600
It's the bop it sound.

1100
04:11:26,600 --> 04:11:27,639
It's the bop it scream.

1101
04:11:27,639 --> 04:11:28,200
I want to hear it.

1102
04:11:29,399 --> 04:11:29,959
Don't clip it.

1103
04:11:29,959 --> 04:11:30,920
I want to see it.

1104
04:11:30,920 --> 04:11:33,100
That's you failed bop it.

1105
04:11:33,100 --> 04:11:37,860
That's like that.

1106
04:11:39,139 --> 04:11:41,299
I want to hear it.

1107
04:11:41,299 --> 04:11:44,440
I need to hear it.

1108
04:11:44,440 --> 04:11:47,500
Don't clip it.

1109
04:11:47,500 --> 04:11:48,459
What do you clip it?

1110
04:11:48,459 --> 04:11:49,819
What do you come on?

1111
04:11:53,299 --> 04:11:54,180
Don't you want to know?

1112
04:11:55,239 --> 04:11:55,639
What is this?

1113
04:11:55,639 --> 04:11:56,360
You're linking.

1114
04:11:56,360 --> 04:11:56,840
I don't know.

1115
04:11:56,840 --> 04:11:58,040
This is not why.

1116
04:11:58,040 --> 04:12:01,909
No, don't link me the actual bop it scream.

1117
04:12:02,549 --> 04:12:06,430
Okay.

1118
04:12:08,090 --> 04:12:10,489
Now link me the clip that just happened.

1119
04:12:10,489 --> 04:12:15,700
We'll compare them.

1120
04:12:15,700 --> 04:12:18,020
Okay, here's this one.

1121
04:12:21,450 --> 04:12:31,879
Same exact thing.

1122
04:12:53,829 --> 04:12:54,469
Reverse it.

1123
04:12:55,030 --> 04:13:02,069
Where are we going?

1124
04:13:04,709 --> 04:13:05,190
Look out.

1125
04:13:25,270 --> 04:13:28,149
Activate order number 66.

1126
04:13:30,059 --> 04:13:30,700
Yes, sir.

1127
04:13:30,700 --> 04:13:31,260
Right away.

1128
04:13:36,620 --> 04:13:41,659
Activate number order 66.

1129
04:13:57,940 --> 04:13:58,979
John Oliver.

1130
04:13:58,979 --> 04:13:59,479
What?

1131
04:14:00,020 --> 04:14:02,739
Oh my God.

1132
04:14:02,739 --> 04:14:03,219
Did you see what happened?

1133
04:14:03,219 --> 04:14:04,020
A guy dropped somebody.

1134
04:14:04,659 --> 04:14:19,860
Activate order number 666.

1135
04:14:20,659 --> 04:14:39,739
This thing is ripping him.

1136
04:14:47,059 --> 04:14:48,260
Oh, he doesn't have a gun.

1137
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:51,670
You're going to get out of him.

1138
04:14:51,670 --> 04:14:52,790
It's a crazy cycle.

1139
04:14:54,709 --> 04:14:55,350
Run, run.

1140
04:14:55,350 --> 04:14:56,629
He's crazy.

1141
04:14:56,629 --> 04:14:57,190
He's crazy.

1142
04:14:57,190 --> 04:14:58,469
There's a crazy guy on the loose.

1143
04:15:28,200 --> 04:15:33,079
Activate order number 666.

1144
04:15:54,819 --> 04:15:56,340
Activate order number 6.

1145
04:15:56,340 --> 04:15:56,979
I just did it too.

1146
04:15:56,979 --> 04:15:57,479
I did it.

1147
04:16:06,899 --> 04:16:19,139
Enhance my order with extra things in it.

1148
04:16:19,940 --> 04:16:27,430
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

1149
04:16:36,280 --> 04:16:37,959
Activate order 66.

1150
04:16:39,530 --> 04:16:40,489
Extra mayonnaise.

1151
04:16:45,049 --> 04:16:45,850
Side of pickles.

1152
04:16:50,219 --> 04:16:53,100
It's a family guy tear joke.

1153
04:16:53,100 --> 04:16:54,459
Nobody even said it, but I said it.

1154
04:16:55,260 --> 04:17:05,180
No, no, no.

1155
04:17:05,180 --> 04:17:05,819
I'll do one more.

1156
04:17:05,819 --> 04:17:07,340
That's a robot chicken joke.

1157
04:17:07,979 --> 04:17:09,260
That's a robot chicken joke.

1158
04:17:12,020 --> 04:17:14,739
Activate order number 66.

1159
04:17:14,819 --> 04:17:18,819
With extra pickles and a few toys.

1160
04:17:18,819 --> 04:17:20,020
I want a McDonald's toy.

1161
04:17:24,620 --> 04:17:27,100
I don't think they make McDonald's toys anymore, sir.

1162
04:17:27,100 --> 04:17:28,940
I don't think they make McDonald's toys anymore.

1163
04:17:28,940 --> 04:17:29,659
Get on it.

1164
04:17:44,889 --> 04:17:46,010
Where's it going?

1165
04:17:46,010 --> 04:17:57,739
Save the game.

1166
04:17:57,739 --> 04:17:58,219
Thank you.

1167
04:17:59,020 --> 04:18:00,219
We got to save Andy's.

1168
04:18:08,549 --> 04:18:09,510
Go back up.

1169
04:18:09,510 --> 04:18:10,950
I don't even care.

1170
04:18:12,149 --> 04:18:14,549
They don't send the guy with the electric hands to do this.

1171
04:18:15,510 --> 04:18:18,229
This is a mission for a covert stealth operator.

1172
04:18:18,870 --> 04:18:20,360
Not the guy that can do this.

1173
04:18:21,159 --> 04:18:33,770
I don't even know where they want me to go.

1174
04:18:33,770 --> 04:18:34,250
Where do I go?

1175
04:18:43,909 --> 04:18:44,469
Back up here?

1176
04:18:45,030 --> 04:18:58,299
Execute order number 66666.

1177
04:18:58,299 --> 04:19:00,500
Press M.

1178
04:19:01,139 --> 04:19:03,319
Yeah, I got to go on the top of the building.

1179
04:19:04,040 --> 04:19:08,709
There's no order in the quote.

1180
04:19:08,709 --> 04:19:09,110
There's not?

1181
04:19:13,159 --> 04:19:14,040
What's the actual quote?

1182
04:19:14,040 --> 04:19:16,780
It's activate order 66.

1183
04:19:17,500 --> 04:19:19,420
Execute order number 66.

1184
04:19:19,420 --> 04:19:20,219
What's the actual quote?

1185
04:19:21,270 --> 04:19:22,149
Activate order.

1186
04:19:22,149 --> 04:19:22,709
Yes, there is.

1187
04:19:23,350 --> 04:19:23,829
Execute.

1188
04:19:24,709 --> 04:19:31,239
The line is activate number 66.

1189
04:19:31,959 --> 04:19:36,979
No, it's like execute order number six.

1190
04:19:36,979 --> 04:19:37,860
What is it actually, though?

1191
04:19:38,659 --> 04:19:40,360
No, it's not.

1192
04:19:40,360 --> 04:19:41,479
So what is the actual one?

1193
04:19:42,360 --> 04:19:44,120
Execute order 66.

1194
04:19:45,579 --> 04:19:48,780
Execute order 666.

1195
04:19:49,819 --> 04:19:50,840
I get it.

1196
04:19:50,840 --> 04:19:51,879
No, it's just two sixes.

1197
04:19:52,440 --> 04:20:01,379
Now that doesn't sound right anymore.

1198
04:20:01,379 --> 04:20:03,299
Execute order 666.

1199
04:20:05,610 --> 04:20:06,569
No, doesn't sound right.

1200
04:20:07,290 --> 04:20:10,360
It's like activate order number 666.

1201
04:20:16,250 --> 04:20:18,489
Activate order number 66.

1202
04:20:19,049 --> 04:20:33,850
Execute order 66.

1203
04:20:33,850 --> 04:20:35,049
That sounds fake.

1204
04:20:35,049 --> 04:20:36,569
That sounds made up, doesn't it?

1205
04:20:36,569 --> 04:20:37,930
That sounds like a fake one.

1206
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:41,979
Execute order 66.

1207
04:20:41,979 --> 04:20:43,260
I feel like mine was better.

1208
04:20:43,979 --> 04:20:44,700
What's happening?

1209
04:20:47,379 --> 04:20:50,940
What do we need to do to get out of the kelp forest?

1210
04:20:53,579 --> 04:21:01,430
Time has come.

1211
04:21:01,430 --> 04:21:03,829
Execute order 66.

1212
04:21:03,829 --> 04:21:07,430
No, it's activate order number 666.

1213
04:21:08,229 --> 04:21:08,870
Mine's better.

1214
04:21:09,959 --> 04:21:10,360
Don't worry.

1215
04:21:10,360 --> 04:21:12,520
George Lucas will redo these movies like five more times.

1216
04:21:12,520 --> 04:21:13,399
He'll use mine later.

1217
04:21:14,040 --> 04:21:18,180
Disney will remaster this like a remastered remaster.

1218
04:21:18,739 --> 04:21:21,940
They'll come up with a black and white version for fucking no reason in like 30 years.

1219
04:21:21,940 --> 04:21:22,340
Don't worry.

1220
04:21:36,250 --> 04:21:36,809
Oh, shit.

1221
04:21:36,809 --> 04:21:37,850
I just blocked that twice.

1222
04:21:46,120 --> 04:21:46,920
I need to go up.

1223
04:21:47,639 --> 04:21:53,719
Oh, I need to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1224
04:21:53,719 --> 04:21:57,670
I can't go up this one.

1225
04:21:57,670 --> 04:21:58,709
Can I go up this one?

1226
04:21:59,270 --> 04:22:01,879
Why would he say 666 though?

1227
04:22:01,879 --> 04:22:02,760
Because it's like Satan.

1228
04:22:13,850 --> 04:22:15,049
Why can I not activate this?

1229
04:22:22,299 --> 04:22:23,180
Playing with fire there.

1230
04:22:23,180 --> 04:22:23,819
I got to stop.

1231
04:22:27,750 --> 04:22:28,389
It's broken.

1232
04:22:29,110 --> 04:22:33,379
Oh, well, I see people over here.

1233
04:22:50,739 --> 04:22:51,860
I just caught him by the neck.

1234
04:22:52,420 --> 04:22:53,299
Oh, my God.

1235
04:22:53,299 --> 04:22:53,940
That's horrible.

1236
04:22:53,940 --> 04:23:00,229
I caught him by his neck and the force snapped it when it came down.

1237
04:23:02,100 --> 04:23:03,219
That was horrible.

1238
04:23:03,219 --> 04:23:05,059
Don't I don't I don't I never want to do that again.

1239
04:23:08,889 --> 04:23:10,090
Big rectangle building.

1240
04:23:10,649 --> 04:23:13,260
I went up there.

1241
04:23:14,059 --> 04:23:15,180
I need to get up though.

1242
04:23:15,819 --> 04:23:18,579
None of these have like a way to go in or up.

1243
04:23:28,170 --> 04:23:30,809
Rectangle, rectangle.

1244
04:23:30,809 --> 04:23:31,290
Yeah, I know.

1245
04:23:31,290 --> 04:23:33,690
But I'm trying I'm trying to find a way up.

1246
04:23:33,690 --> 04:23:39,959
I need to go up.

1247
04:23:41,260 --> 04:23:41,899
Up, not down.

1248
04:23:41,899 --> 04:23:42,459
I want to go up.

1249
04:23:43,100 --> 04:23:46,500
This game is so painfully easy, Omega Lo.

1250
04:23:47,139 --> 04:23:50,329
You're fired.

1251
04:23:50,329 --> 04:23:58,219
I'm throwing one of the green shit.

1252
04:23:58,780 --> 04:24:03,899
You're fired.

1253
04:24:20,090 --> 04:24:21,770
Finally, I just had to press one button.

1254
04:24:27,000 --> 04:24:36,059
All right.

1255
04:24:36,059 --> 04:24:38,700
So I got to go that way.

1256
04:24:38,700 --> 04:24:39,739
Don't die from fall damage.

1257
04:24:42,840 --> 04:24:43,239
Hey, you.

1258
04:24:57,420 --> 04:24:59,180
What the fuck was I doing that for?

1259
04:25:00,059 --> 04:25:04,440
I want to do like a cool exit.

1260
04:25:07,270 --> 04:25:09,030
My God, please, Jared, stop.

1261
04:25:09,989 --> 04:25:11,590
You're gonna fucking freak me out.

1262
04:25:11,590 --> 04:25:12,309
Just stop.

1263
04:25:12,309 --> 04:25:14,149
I'm just trying to rush so much.

1264
04:25:30,659 --> 04:25:31,540
He's too high.

1265
04:25:32,180 --> 04:25:33,059
I'm not high.

1266
04:25:34,860 --> 04:25:37,180
I don't you know, I'm a high every day, guys.

1267
04:25:37,180 --> 04:25:37,659
Relax.

1268
04:25:38,540 --> 04:25:44,139
I'm gonna vaporize this guy.

1269
04:25:44,139 --> 04:25:44,639
Hold on.

1270
04:26:06,459 --> 04:26:14,780
How do I pick these up?

1271
04:26:15,579 --> 04:26:20,790
Is this Halloween?

1272
04:26:20,790 --> 04:26:21,190
No, no, no.

1273
04:26:21,190 --> 04:26:22,149
That was Duel of Fates.

1274
04:26:23,530 --> 04:26:24,809
This is Halloween.

1275
04:26:24,809 --> 04:26:26,250
This is Halloween.

1276
04:26:26,250 --> 04:26:27,610
This is Halloween.

1277
04:26:29,209 --> 04:26:29,850
Now they're different.

1278
04:26:30,569 --> 04:26:32,620
They're different enough.

1279
04:26:34,940 --> 04:26:35,739
Let's go up.

1280
04:26:35,739 --> 04:26:36,620
This goes down.

1281
04:26:36,620 --> 04:26:37,659
Oh, my fucking God.

1282
04:26:37,659 --> 04:26:38,540
I'm gonna lose my mind.

1283
04:26:59,219 --> 04:27:08,899
Come on.

1284
04:27:12,940 --> 04:27:14,219
What the fuck do I do?

1285
04:27:15,180 --> 04:27:23,659
I don't like this mission either.

1286
04:27:23,659 --> 04:27:24,540
This one's stupid.

1287
04:27:27,799 --> 04:27:28,760
I'm gonna stand right here

1288
04:27:28,760 --> 04:27:30,760
and you guys tell me what direction to walk in.

1289
04:27:30,760 --> 04:27:35,670
Should I go left that way or right this way?

1290
04:27:35,670 --> 04:27:44,649
Oh, immediate left.

1291
04:27:53,510 --> 04:27:55,399
Oh, a TIE fighter crashed in here.

1292
04:27:56,120 --> 04:27:59,610
The boss.

1293
04:28:01,079 --> 04:28:03,479
Yes, my liege.

1294
04:28:07,420 --> 04:28:28,440
All right.

1295
04:28:28,440 --> 04:28:29,159
Now where?

1296
04:28:29,159 --> 04:28:30,620
Wait, where do I go now?

1297
04:28:52,629 --> 04:28:56,059
Can you learn the toxic choreography for us?

1298
04:29:07,370 --> 04:29:07,930
I went up.

1299
04:29:08,809 --> 04:29:09,530
I went up.

1300
04:29:10,469 --> 04:29:12,069
Now what am I supposed to do?

1301
04:29:12,069 --> 04:29:13,190
I hate this.

1302
04:29:13,190 --> 04:29:14,569
I can't go in there.

1303
04:29:15,129 --> 04:29:28,409
Oh, my God.

1304
04:29:28,409 --> 04:29:29,610
I fucking hate this.

1305
04:29:29,610 --> 04:29:30,489
Are you serious?

1306
04:29:30,489 --> 04:29:31,690
This is too easy.

1307
04:29:34,969 --> 04:29:36,170
Fire yourself out of a cannon.

1308
04:29:42,700 --> 04:29:44,379
Next, take out the communications array.

1309
04:29:44,459 --> 04:29:46,520
So they can't signal for help.

1310
04:29:46,520 --> 04:29:47,639
Okay, I will.

1311
04:29:48,680 --> 04:29:50,360
Here goes the communications array.

1312
04:29:51,079 --> 04:29:55,079
I gotta go all the way across the whole damn planet.

1313
04:30:02,920 --> 04:30:10,659
SpongeBob.

1314
04:30:10,659 --> 04:30:11,459
SpongeBob.

1315
04:30:12,180 --> 04:30:12,979
SpongeBob.

1316
04:30:13,540 --> 04:30:15,879
Yeah, SpongeBob.

1317
04:30:17,159 --> 04:30:18,920
Where's the communications thing?

1318
04:30:18,920 --> 04:30:19,399
It was over here.

1319
04:30:19,959 --> 04:30:20,579
Where?

1320
04:30:21,059 --> 04:30:25,750
Where is it?

1321
04:30:26,469 --> 04:30:27,530
Over here?

1322
04:30:27,530 --> 04:30:51,270
Going up here?

1323
04:30:51,270 --> 04:30:52,309
Why is this not fixed?

1324
04:30:53,590 --> 04:30:57,030
Stop fucking around.

1325
04:30:57,030 --> 04:30:58,629
It's up there, isn't it?

1326
04:30:58,629 --> 04:31:01,909
I need to get up there.

1327
04:31:01,909 --> 04:31:03,909
So I need to go in here and go...

1328
04:31:03,909 --> 04:31:04,950
How do I get up to here?

1329
04:31:07,770 --> 04:31:11,290
Activate elevator number 666.

1330
04:31:11,290 --> 04:31:24,760
I didn't...

1331
04:31:24,760 --> 04:31:25,719
Somebody in chat said that.

1332
04:31:25,719 --> 04:31:26,760
I just read it out loud.

1333
04:31:40,620 --> 04:31:40,940
Okay.

1334
04:31:41,979 --> 04:31:43,500
Open the door.

1335
04:31:43,500 --> 04:31:45,500
And I go to the communications depot.

1336
04:31:46,459 --> 04:31:49,620
Did you miss any funny German moments?

1337
04:31:49,620 --> 04:31:51,219
You missed a big one.

1338
04:32:02,950 --> 04:32:03,350
All right.

1339
04:32:03,350 --> 04:32:03,670
Boom.

1340
04:32:06,040 --> 04:32:13,319
Say the funny 66 line.

1341
04:32:13,319 --> 04:32:13,879
All right, sure.

1342
04:32:20,090 --> 04:32:21,129
How does it get from Boston?

1343
04:32:25,780 --> 04:32:26,500
It's down there, right?

1344
04:32:27,139 --> 04:32:45,940
All right.

1345
04:32:45,940 --> 04:32:47,459
I'm supposed to do the 66 thing.

1346
04:32:48,500 --> 04:32:53,379
Activate order number 66.

1347
04:32:54,180 --> 04:32:58,790
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

1348
04:32:58,790 --> 04:33:09,110
Wait, I can...

1349
04:33:23,560 --> 04:33:24,759
Star Wars fans are leaving?

1350
04:33:24,759 --> 04:33:25,400
Why would they?

1351
04:33:25,400 --> 04:33:28,119
I'm one of the only people playing a Star Wars game on Twitch right now.

1352
04:33:29,240 --> 04:33:30,380
You're all here.

1353
04:33:31,180 --> 04:33:36,500
Where is it?

1354
04:33:39,189 --> 04:33:40,069
In the command center.

1355
04:33:40,869 --> 04:33:41,669
Straight up from here.

1356
04:33:42,389 --> 04:33:46,520
Everyone here right now is a Star Wars fan.

1357
04:33:51,819 --> 04:33:54,139
Drop two and a half thousand viewers when the streams peak.

1358
04:33:56,470 --> 04:33:58,630
You know how many people had to go to dinner like two hours ago?

1359
04:33:59,270 --> 04:34:05,080
All right, I'm gonna get up there.

1360
04:34:05,639 --> 04:34:10,650
Now how many people went to dinner two hours ago?

1361
04:34:10,650 --> 04:34:11,049
I did.

1362
04:34:12,009 --> 04:34:26,360
I went BRB and I ate a bowl of spaghetti as fast as I could.

1363
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:35,669
All right, so this is all the way up or where are we?

1364
04:34:36,310 --> 04:34:39,880
This is the last one.

1365
04:34:39,880 --> 04:34:41,240
It's like right up here, isn't it?

1366
04:34:41,240 --> 04:34:42,040
Go up even higher?

1367
04:34:55,110 --> 04:34:56,709
Who's saying that?

1368
04:34:59,720 --> 04:35:00,360
Oh, it's you.

1369
04:35:44,060 --> 04:35:44,779
No honor.

1370
04:35:47,110 --> 04:35:48,790
Just like throwing knives at him.

1371
04:35:51,799 --> 04:35:53,159
And the final one is...

1372
04:35:54,299 --> 04:35:55,259
All the way up.

1373
04:35:55,259 --> 04:36:05,180
Got the rocket ammo.

1374
04:36:05,740 --> 04:36:08,580
Dude, I got rocket ammo.

1375
04:36:08,580 --> 04:36:10,099
I don't know what that means, but I got it.

1376
04:36:13,639 --> 04:36:14,439
It's a different building.

1377
04:36:15,080 --> 04:36:21,419
Which building is it?

1378
04:36:21,419 --> 04:36:31,189
That one right here?

1379
04:36:31,189 --> 04:36:31,990
Yeah, it's this one right here.

1380
04:36:32,709 --> 04:36:33,939
Right in the middle, right?

1381
04:36:34,580 --> 04:36:38,500
Don't die!

1382
04:36:38,500 --> 04:36:40,099
Holy shit, I'm okay.

1383
04:36:40,979 --> 04:36:46,250
Secret area.

1384
04:36:46,250 --> 04:36:50,540
All right, it's right...

1385
04:36:50,540 --> 04:36:51,580
Where is it? In here?

1386
04:36:51,580 --> 04:37:03,700
How do I get in this?

1387
04:37:03,700 --> 04:37:32,180
How do I get up there?

1388
04:37:34,810 --> 04:37:41,130
Oh, he looked at chat once in the last 10 minutes.

1389
04:37:43,319 --> 04:37:44,119
Um, hold on.

1390
04:37:44,119 --> 04:37:44,759
I'm currently...

1391
04:37:44,759 --> 04:37:45,799
I'm a little busy right now.

1392
04:37:46,360 --> 04:37:56,810
I don't even know what's shooting at me.

1393
04:38:00,279 --> 04:38:01,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1394
04:38:21,580 --> 04:38:24,939
Oh, fuck off with this bullshit.

1395
04:38:24,939 --> 04:38:26,950
Are you serious?

1396
04:38:26,950 --> 04:38:27,830
You gotta be kidding me.

1397
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:35,799
No way.

1398
04:38:35,799 --> 04:38:36,759
This is so dumb.

1399
04:38:37,639 --> 04:38:45,540
Well, let's go back this way first, I guess.

1400
04:38:48,439 --> 04:38:49,159
I went over here too.

1401
04:38:50,389 --> 04:38:51,669
Yeah, this is all in a line.

1402
04:38:51,669 --> 04:38:52,069
Let's go.

1403
04:38:52,630 --> 04:38:55,340
I don't know, just...

1404
04:38:55,340 --> 04:38:58,860
I fucking fat fingered and pressed dash.

1405
04:39:00,650 --> 04:39:02,490
I pressed plus instead of dash.

1406
04:39:02,490 --> 04:39:03,130
I pressed...

1407
04:39:03,930 --> 04:39:08,330
They're both right next to each other.

1408
04:39:08,330 --> 04:39:10,250
And I just pressed them both the same goddamn time.

1409
04:39:10,970 --> 04:39:12,220
Whatever.

1410
04:39:12,220 --> 04:39:12,939
It doesn't even matter.

1411
04:39:12,939 --> 04:39:14,139
I'm gonna get up there and just wait.

1412
04:39:14,139 --> 04:39:14,619
Just watch.

1413
04:39:14,619 --> 04:39:15,020
I got it.

1414
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:15,500
Everything's fine.

1415
04:39:17,099 --> 04:39:20,299
Yeah, I mean, give me...

1416
04:39:20,299 --> 04:39:21,419
Where's the fucking elevator?

1417
04:39:22,299 --> 04:39:31,299
Oh, go in that door!

1418
04:39:49,610 --> 04:39:51,849
Jayden, look out.

1419
04:39:51,849 --> 04:39:52,889
They've got tanks.

1420
04:39:52,889 --> 04:39:53,849
They've got tanks.

1421
04:39:53,849 --> 04:39:54,250
They've got...

1422
04:39:54,250 --> 04:39:55,130
How do I end up down here?

1423
04:39:56,700 --> 04:39:58,860
Tank, tank!

1424
04:39:58,860 --> 04:40:07,540
Where is it?

1425
04:40:08,340 --> 04:40:09,939
Oh, you're so scary.

1426
04:40:09,939 --> 04:40:10,819
You're so scary.

1427
04:40:16,119 --> 04:40:17,000
Just whatever.

1428
04:40:17,000 --> 04:40:17,240
Go.

1429
04:40:17,959 --> 04:40:30,229
It's the first one.

1430
04:40:30,229 --> 04:40:31,270
One, two, three in a row.

1431
04:40:33,849 --> 04:40:34,650
He's throwing.

1432
04:40:34,650 --> 04:40:35,529
I'm not throwing.

1433
04:40:35,529 --> 04:40:36,169
I'm fine.

1434
04:40:45,610 --> 04:40:46,330
All right, here we go.

1435
04:40:46,330 --> 04:40:49,049
One, two, three.

1436
04:40:50,330 --> 04:40:54,470
Have you been drinking?

1437
04:40:54,470 --> 04:40:55,270
No, I'm not drinking.

1438
04:40:55,270 --> 04:40:56,229
I'm just having a...

1439
04:40:56,229 --> 04:40:57,189
I'm just messing around.

1440
04:40:57,189 --> 04:40:58,389
Everybody needs to relax

1441
04:40:58,389 --> 04:40:59,590
before I get angry with you.

1442
04:41:00,229 --> 04:41:05,459
You know what?

1443
04:41:05,459 --> 04:41:06,259
Do you know how I can see him?

1444
04:41:18,090 --> 04:41:19,849
One, two, three.

1445
04:41:19,849 --> 04:41:20,330
Okay.

1446
04:41:20,330 --> 04:41:20,729
Over here.

1447
04:41:27,900 --> 04:41:29,419
Dude's in a drunken rage.

1448
04:41:30,220 --> 04:41:33,459
How much did I sleep last night?

1449
04:41:34,020 --> 04:41:35,459
Um, like an hour?

1450
04:41:36,099 --> 04:41:36,740
What even?

1451
04:41:36,740 --> 04:41:37,220
30 minutes?

1452
04:41:38,259 --> 04:41:53,639
All right, deactivate.

1453
04:42:00,069 --> 04:42:00,709
Go to bed?

1454
04:42:02,279 --> 04:42:02,680
I will.

1455
04:42:03,560 --> 04:42:03,880
Later.

1456
04:42:04,439 --> 04:42:06,060
No, I slept like seven hours.

1457
04:42:11,180 --> 04:42:12,299
Uh, two more over here.

1458
04:42:26,069 --> 04:42:26,389
No, it's...

1459
04:42:27,189 --> 04:42:29,459
Turn this shit off.

1460
04:42:30,099 --> 04:42:37,080
You're doing great, Jayden.

1461
04:42:37,979 --> 04:42:38,860
Only one more.

1462
04:42:54,869 --> 04:42:55,189
Got it.

1463
04:42:55,189 --> 04:42:56,229
That did it.

1464
04:42:56,229 --> 04:42:57,750
Get back in your ship, Jayden.

1465
04:42:57,750 --> 04:42:58,549
We're out of here.

1466
04:42:59,430 --> 04:42:59,750
All right.

1467
04:42:59,750 --> 04:43:01,509
Where's my ship?

1468
04:43:03,700 --> 04:43:04,500
Do you know where it is?

1469
04:43:04,500 --> 04:43:04,979
I don't know.

1470
04:43:06,490 --> 04:43:07,450
I have no idea.

1471
04:43:14,439 --> 04:43:15,080
Big hanger?

1472
04:43:15,639 --> 04:43:26,340
Where is that?

1473
04:43:26,979 --> 04:43:36,790
Joe, what's your big hanger?

1474
04:43:38,090 --> 04:43:40,380
Um, it's down?

1475
04:43:40,939 --> 04:43:44,020
Oh, it just fell off.

1476
04:43:50,069 --> 04:43:50,950
Down there?

1477
04:43:50,950 --> 04:43:55,130
Where is it?

1478
04:44:03,740 --> 04:44:04,139
Over there.

1479
04:44:06,700 --> 04:44:07,259
Pretending?

1480
04:44:07,819 --> 04:44:09,099
No, I haven't paid a...

1481
04:44:09,099 --> 04:44:12,380
Guys, I have not paid a single attention to anything that has happened in this entire

1482
04:44:12,380 --> 04:44:13,180
level because I hate it.

1483
04:44:15,290 --> 04:44:16,169
I hate this level.

1484
04:44:16,169 --> 04:44:20,090
So I've just been going through the motions to just kill things and walk around in circles

1485
04:44:20,090 --> 04:44:21,049
till somebody says stop.

1486
04:44:21,610 --> 04:44:23,049
Like one of you guys says just...

1487
04:44:23,049 --> 04:44:23,689
Oh, they're left.

1488
04:44:23,689 --> 04:44:24,090
Like, okay.

1489
04:44:24,650 --> 04:44:41,299
I made it.

1490
04:44:54,709 --> 04:44:55,580
Good for us.

1491
04:45:08,200 --> 04:45:08,439
Hmm.

1492
04:45:09,240 --> 04:45:13,450
What's a good one?

1493
04:45:16,299 --> 04:45:17,340
Uh, probably gonna do one more.

1494
04:45:18,139 --> 04:45:18,459
What's...

1495
04:45:18,459 --> 04:45:19,659
What's the best one on this list?

1496
04:45:20,860 --> 04:45:30,200
Cult Investigation or Meet Contact.

1497
04:45:31,860 --> 04:45:33,700
Cult, cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.

1498
04:45:34,340 --> 04:45:36,680
People saying this one's good.

1499
04:45:36,680 --> 04:45:40,970
This is a driving level?

1500
04:45:40,970 --> 04:45:41,209
Done.

1501
04:45:45,340 --> 04:46:01,400
It is...

1502
04:46:01,400 --> 04:46:02,360
Holy shit, it is.

1503
04:46:02,360 --> 04:46:03,159
It's a full letter grid.

1504
04:46:03,880 --> 04:46:15,580
Oh, why did I just do that weird skip?

1505
04:46:16,139 --> 04:46:18,069
That was really bizarre.

1506
04:46:18,790 --> 04:46:30,200
Um, wait, why?

1507
04:46:31,639 --> 04:46:32,200
What's happening?

1508
04:46:37,639 --> 04:46:40,389
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

1509
04:46:40,389 --> 04:46:41,590
There were no instructions.

1510
04:46:42,389 --> 04:46:43,909
There was not a single instruction.

1511
04:46:46,180 --> 04:46:47,139
I shook this guy's hand.

1512
04:46:47,139 --> 04:46:49,779
I did like a little frolic onto the motorcycle and...

1513
04:46:50,659 --> 04:47:04,340
Okay, I'm just...

1514
04:47:04,340 --> 04:47:07,060
This is really hard to control with a mouse and keyboard.

1515
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:13,319
Okay, I think we're good.

1516
04:47:21,580 --> 04:47:23,340
Meet the contact that has outpost.

1517
04:47:24,060 --> 04:47:26,090
Where's this guy's...

1518
04:47:26,090 --> 04:47:27,209
Where's his outpost?

1519
04:47:41,319 --> 04:47:42,119
Wrong way.

1520
04:47:44,220 --> 04:47:45,500
Use your lightsaber?

1521
04:47:51,349 --> 04:47:52,150
What?

1522
04:47:52,150 --> 04:47:53,270
Why am I still alive?

1523
04:47:53,990 --> 04:47:54,950
I'm still alive.

1524
04:48:19,770 --> 04:48:21,529
With a long drive all over again.

1525
04:48:28,090 --> 04:48:28,409
What?

1526
04:48:37,590 --> 04:48:37,990
Just die.

1527
04:48:37,990 --> 04:48:38,389
How do I...

1528
04:48:38,389 --> 04:48:38,790
Just die.

1529
04:48:38,790 --> 04:48:39,189
Die.

1530
04:48:39,189 --> 04:48:39,430
Die.

1531
04:48:56,389 --> 04:48:57,669
Okay, so where do I go?

1532
04:49:02,779 --> 04:49:03,259
This way?

1533
04:49:03,979 --> 04:49:20,470
You guys did still.

1534
04:49:28,759 --> 04:49:30,759
It's literally a racetrack.

1535
04:49:30,759 --> 04:49:38,069
Okay, but didn't it say I was going the wrong way when I went this way?

1536
04:49:38,069 --> 04:49:38,310
Yeah.

1537
04:49:38,310 --> 04:49:39,909
So what the fuck do I do here?

1538
04:49:46,779 --> 04:49:47,979
Do I have to jump through?

1539
04:49:49,740 --> 04:49:50,060
What?

1540
04:49:58,700 --> 04:50:02,939
God, what happened?

1541
04:50:02,939 --> 04:50:03,819
Jump through it?

1542
04:50:04,459 --> 04:50:06,419
I don't know what you mean.

1543
04:50:07,720 --> 04:50:09,000
How do I jump with this?

1544
04:50:13,430 --> 04:50:16,229
Oh, you mean like actually jump just me.

1545
04:50:16,790 --> 04:50:28,099
What the hell?

1546
04:50:28,099 --> 04:50:28,819
That's not fun.

1547
04:50:29,459 --> 04:50:38,779
Isn't that Luke?

1548
04:50:45,500 --> 04:50:46,619
Yeah, I ran into some trouble.

1549
04:50:48,619 --> 04:50:50,139
I really fucked up a few times.

1550
04:51:07,540 --> 04:51:09,619
Okay, so so far so good.

1551
04:51:10,340 --> 04:51:12,340
I want the purple one.

1552
04:51:17,049 --> 04:51:17,849
Give me any of them.

1553
04:51:18,490 --> 04:51:26,889
I can't get on it.

1554
04:51:26,889 --> 04:51:28,169
Get on the bike, dude.

1555
04:51:28,169 --> 04:51:28,889
Get on the bike.

1556
04:51:29,689 --> 04:51:29,930
Get...

1557
04:51:44,470 --> 04:51:45,430
I hit the gas.

1558
04:51:45,430 --> 04:51:47,430
I pressed the gas way too hard.

1559
04:51:48,229 --> 04:51:49,349
If you go in a go-kart

1560
04:51:51,180 --> 04:51:53,419
and you press down on the gas pedal way too hard,

1561
04:51:53,419 --> 04:51:54,779
you go fucking flying.

1562
04:52:06,419 --> 04:52:08,020
Major whiff flash.

1563
04:52:13,799 --> 04:52:14,520
I just did something.

1564
04:52:14,520 --> 04:52:15,080
What did I just do?

1565
04:52:46,470 --> 04:52:48,709
Just get me the fuck out of here.

1566
04:52:48,709 --> 04:52:49,669
Get me out of here.

1567
04:52:51,430 --> 04:52:52,709
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1568
04:52:52,709 --> 04:52:53,430
Give me the bike back.

1569
04:52:55,110 --> 04:53:04,950
Give me that bike.

1570
04:53:32,020 --> 04:53:32,580
Jump off.

1571
04:53:33,299 --> 04:53:42,889
Oh, shit.

1572
04:53:42,889 --> 04:53:44,169
Go, go, go, go, go.

1573
04:53:44,169 --> 04:53:54,259
Looks like I'm not going back that...

1574
04:53:54,259 --> 04:53:54,500
All right.

1575
04:53:58,889 --> 04:54:02,099
I didn't even...

1576
04:54:02,819 --> 04:54:04,900
Hey, he's coming kind of right for me.

1577
04:54:04,900 --> 04:54:05,380
He's kind of...

1578
04:54:06,259 --> 04:54:20,090
What's happening?

1579
04:54:36,169 --> 04:54:38,009
This dude, what's going on?

1580
04:54:38,009 --> 04:54:38,490
Why is he...

1581
04:54:46,979 --> 04:54:48,259
He's like, all right, man.

1582
04:54:48,259 --> 04:54:49,139
All right, you win.

1583
04:54:51,990 --> 04:54:53,270
Did he put a grenade down?

1584
04:54:53,270 --> 04:54:53,990
I don't even know.

1585
04:54:59,669 --> 04:54:59,909
No.

1586
04:55:06,970 --> 04:55:07,770
I'm going to pass out.

1587
04:55:07,770 --> 04:55:08,409
I have to hold on.

1588
04:55:10,759 --> 04:55:11,080
Hold on.

1589
04:55:11,080 --> 04:55:12,759
I'm going to pass out if I don't fucking stop.

1590
04:55:19,319 --> 04:55:20,279
The guy behind me.

1591
04:55:21,400 --> 04:55:23,240
He went very far, by the way.

1592
04:55:25,159 --> 04:55:32,860
This is so hard to control with the mouse.

1593
04:55:38,810 --> 04:55:39,450
Okay.

1594
04:55:39,450 --> 04:55:40,569
So should I go over there?

1595
04:55:45,610 --> 04:55:47,130
Spam D on your keyboard.

1596
04:55:47,849 --> 04:55:48,950
I'm not going to do that.

1597
04:55:51,159 --> 04:55:56,819
Where are the enemies?

1598
04:55:57,619 --> 04:55:58,950
Oh, here they come.

1599
04:56:00,060 --> 04:56:00,459
Stop.

1600
04:56:01,099 --> 04:56:01,590
Okay.

1601
04:56:02,310 --> 04:56:04,970
It's a tiny hole to go in.

1602
04:56:07,939 --> 04:56:08,340
Goodness.

1603
04:56:09,060 --> 04:56:15,189
Cool.

1604
04:56:15,189 --> 04:56:15,590
All right.

1605
04:56:15,590 --> 04:56:16,069
Keep going.

1606
04:56:16,869 --> 04:56:22,220
I don't know what is doing, but it was just dragging me around like crazy.

1607
04:56:24,340 --> 04:56:26,580
I do not feel very much in control right now at all.

1608
04:56:40,700 --> 04:56:41,900
What is going on?

1609
04:56:45,180 --> 04:56:46,139
What is going on?

1610
04:56:46,860 --> 04:56:53,340
Wait, didn't I just do this?

1611
04:56:57,860 --> 04:57:09,319
I had no control of what was just going on at all.

1612
04:57:10,360 --> 04:57:18,520
Get away from me.

1613
04:57:18,520 --> 04:57:21,979
What am I...

1614
04:57:21,979 --> 04:57:22,700
Why am I watching?

1615
04:57:23,419 --> 04:57:24,220
What?

1616
04:57:24,220 --> 04:57:26,439
Why did I need to see that?

1617
04:57:28,540 --> 04:57:35,529
Wait, I'm in the...

1618
04:57:35,529 --> 04:57:36,090
I can't move.

1619
04:57:39,290 --> 04:57:40,729
Get the fuck off the wall.

1620
04:57:45,479 --> 04:57:47,080
Why are they all doing this?

1621
04:57:48,409 --> 04:57:52,900
Turn this way?

1622
04:57:56,860 --> 04:57:58,779
Oh my fucking God.

1623
04:57:58,779 --> 04:57:59,020
Where...

1624
04:58:00,569 --> 04:58:01,130
Get off.

1625
04:58:01,130 --> 04:58:02,650
Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.

1626
04:58:13,430 --> 04:58:14,709
I can't control the motorcycle.

1627
04:58:14,709 --> 04:58:16,630
It just flies the fuck out of the way.

1628
04:58:16,630 --> 04:58:17,430
I can't do anything.

1629
04:58:18,229 --> 04:58:19,770
Do I even get on it?

1630
04:58:25,740 --> 04:58:26,220
I'm...

1631
04:58:26,220 --> 04:58:26,939
Stop boosting.

1632
04:58:26,939 --> 04:58:27,819
I didn't even boost.

1633
04:58:28,619 --> 04:58:29,819
It just threw me up there.

1634
04:58:31,099 --> 04:58:36,659
All right, I boosted there because I had to.

1635
04:58:37,299 --> 04:58:38,810
Wait, why...

1636
04:58:39,689 --> 04:58:41,459
You turn with the mouse?

1637
04:58:41,459 --> 04:58:43,619
Yeah, it's like dog shit.

1638
04:58:59,000 --> 04:59:00,360
It's so hard.

1639
04:59:00,919 --> 04:59:01,959
It's so hard.

1640
04:59:01,959 --> 04:59:03,319
It's so annoying to control.

1641
04:59:07,290 --> 04:59:07,930
I can't.

1642
04:59:07,930 --> 04:59:08,169
I...

1643
04:59:08,970 --> 04:59:10,540
My fucking God.

1644
04:59:10,540 --> 04:59:11,979
I just fell out of the sky.

1645
04:59:11,979 --> 04:59:13,500
Like I fell out of the goddamn sky.

1646
04:59:14,139 --> 04:59:15,979
I don't have to nose bleed?

1647
04:59:16,779 --> 04:59:17,020
No.

1648
04:59:18,169 --> 04:59:18,889
What?

1649
04:59:18,889 --> 04:59:26,889
Did I just go in this building?

1650
04:59:27,529 --> 04:59:29,290
I don't even know what way is the right way anymore.

1651
04:59:29,930 --> 04:59:30,810
What's the correct way?

1652
04:59:31,450 --> 04:59:32,700
Just in the building.

1653
04:59:33,419 --> 04:59:38,779
Okay, five people just died.

1654
04:59:51,770 --> 05:00:05,029
Uh, did I do it?

1655
05:00:05,590 --> 05:00:20,819
Don't strafe.

1656
05:00:24,889 --> 05:00:26,330
I'm not doing that.

1657
05:00:26,330 --> 05:00:28,569
I'm telling you right now, I'm not doing that.

1658
05:00:34,229 --> 05:00:35,110
Okay, I made it.

1659
05:00:35,750 --> 05:00:36,659
By going...

1660
05:00:37,939 --> 05:00:43,450
Escape from the mercenaries and make your way to the far city gate.

1661
05:00:55,669 --> 05:00:56,069
Save it.

1662
05:00:56,630 --> 05:01:05,720
I think I'm getting close, I think.

1663
05:01:06,279 --> 05:01:12,380
I have no idea what just happened.

1664
05:01:12,380 --> 05:01:12,860
Is this it?

1665
05:01:13,500 --> 05:01:19,819
Why do I feel like I'm...

1666
05:01:19,819 --> 05:01:21,340
Use turbo to jump the chasm.

1667
05:01:21,979 --> 05:01:28,439
It didn't make it.

1668
05:01:41,299 --> 05:01:42,259
Uh, now...

1669
05:01:42,900 --> 05:01:44,500
This way.

1670
05:01:57,909 --> 05:01:58,549
Got him.

1671
05:01:58,549 --> 05:02:03,130
Give me your fucking bike right now.

1672
05:02:03,130 --> 05:02:07,540
My fucking God.

1673
05:02:07,540 --> 05:02:12,729
Oh my God.

1674
05:02:13,610 --> 05:02:40,119
I'm not doing...

1675
05:02:40,119 --> 05:02:49,819
Oh my fucking God.

1676
05:02:49,819 --> 05:02:50,619
Dude, why?

1677
05:02:51,340 --> 05:02:54,220
Give me one of your bikes right now before I freak out.

1678
05:02:54,860 --> 05:02:55,740
They just squished me with...

1679
05:02:55,740 --> 05:02:57,580
They squished my heads together like...

1680
05:02:57,580 --> 05:02:57,819
Too...

1681
05:03:10,069 --> 05:03:10,310
Get...

1682
05:03:13,500 --> 05:03:14,220
Leave me alone.

1683
05:03:20,009 --> 05:03:20,650
Give me that bike.

1684
05:03:21,130 --> 05:03:22,569
His bike is in better condition than mine.

1685
05:03:23,290 --> 05:03:24,569
It just fucking exploded.

1686
05:03:31,240 --> 05:03:32,040
There's the gate!

1687
05:03:32,680 --> 05:03:33,639
I made it to the gate!

1688
05:03:44,939 --> 05:03:45,500
Thank God.

1689
05:03:49,659 --> 05:03:50,459
Oh, thank goodness.

1690
05:03:59,180 --> 05:04:00,540
I don't care about that.

1691
05:04:00,540 --> 05:04:01,500
Just tell me what to do.

1692
05:04:02,220 --> 05:04:06,150
What time is it?

1693
05:04:06,150 --> 05:04:07,509
All right, I'll do...

1694
05:04:08,069 --> 05:04:08,950
I'll do one more.

1695
05:04:08,950 --> 05:04:09,590
We'll do...

1696
05:04:09,590 --> 05:04:10,470
I'll be the boss.

1697
05:04:10,470 --> 05:04:11,590
We'll do the next two missions.

1698
05:04:12,310 --> 05:04:16,630
Don't engage members of the cult.

1699
05:04:18,150 --> 05:04:18,869
What are you talking about?

1700
05:04:18,869 --> 05:04:19,509
Don't engage.

1701
05:04:20,389 --> 05:04:38,040
Don't engage them.

1702
05:04:54,650 --> 05:04:54,970
Okay.

1703
05:04:56,009 --> 05:05:01,740
Well, they can't take my lightning powers away from me.

1704
05:05:11,240 --> 05:05:13,080
Ah, feisty.

1705
05:05:13,080 --> 05:05:15,479
Well, I got caught so I could get inside without a problem.

1706
05:05:15,479 --> 05:05:15,959
Okay, I get it.

1707
05:05:15,959 --> 05:05:17,959
I have a proposition for you.

1708
05:05:17,959 --> 05:05:24,840
You see, it can get dreadfully dull around here, so I'm up for a bit of sport.

1709
05:05:24,840 --> 05:05:26,439
I'm going to let you out.

1710
05:05:27,080 --> 05:05:30,599
If you can make it back to your ship, you're free to leave.

1711
05:05:31,560 --> 05:05:35,799
But if I catch you, I'll have to shoot you.

1712
05:05:36,700 --> 05:05:39,500
After all, you are an escaped prisoner.

1713
05:05:40,380 --> 05:05:45,979
Hopefully, you'll prove more of a challenge than a bounty hunter I had to kill a few days ago.

1714
05:05:46,779 --> 05:05:51,180
Of course, I've never hunted a Jedi before.

1715
05:05:51,180 --> 05:05:53,500
And if I refuse to play along?

1716
05:05:53,500 --> 05:05:56,220
Well, then you can rot in your cell.

1717
05:05:56,220 --> 05:05:58,779
I'm sure someone might come looking for you.

1718
05:05:59,500 --> 05:06:00,459
Eventually.

1719
05:06:01,500 --> 05:06:03,479
Okay, Jedi.

1720
05:06:03,479 --> 05:06:05,080
The games begin.

1721
05:06:06,439 --> 05:06:11,590
Okay, let me out.

1722
05:06:11,590 --> 05:06:12,389
He's going to let me out.

1723
05:06:15,580 --> 05:06:16,540
Are there other people in the cells?

1724
05:06:16,540 --> 05:06:17,340
Can I let them out, too?

1725
05:06:23,860 --> 05:06:24,900
He gave me a weapon, too.

1726
05:06:25,619 --> 05:06:26,740
I don't even need it.

1727
05:06:26,740 --> 05:06:30,409
I got out.

1728
05:06:30,409 --> 05:06:37,979
Oh, I don't have a lightsaber.

1729
05:06:40,950 --> 05:06:45,849
The guy didn't even have a chance to load his gun.

1730
05:07:03,880 --> 05:07:07,959
Okay.

1731
05:07:07,959 --> 05:07:08,840
Oh, third person.

1732
05:07:10,619 --> 05:07:11,020
Helpful.

1733
05:07:16,360 --> 05:07:17,479
Holy shit, that was awesome.

1734
05:07:18,200 --> 05:07:19,639
That guy just got hit by his...

1735
05:07:19,639 --> 05:07:20,279
That was awesome.

1736
05:07:20,279 --> 05:07:20,759
I loved it.

1737
05:07:21,479 --> 05:07:22,599
Absolutely loved it.

1738
05:07:23,240 --> 05:07:32,360
This thing shoots fast.

1739
05:07:32,360 --> 05:07:40,069
Which door?

1740
05:07:40,869 --> 05:07:41,590
Well, this one.

1741
05:07:42,229 --> 05:07:43,619
That's the one.

1742
05:07:55,689 --> 05:07:55,930
P.

1743
05:08:01,209 --> 05:08:02,889
Open the doors for all the cells.

1744
05:08:02,889 --> 05:08:03,930
Let all the prisoners out.

1745
05:08:03,930 --> 05:08:05,209
Let them come out.

1746
05:08:05,209 --> 05:08:08,250
I need to pause.

1747
05:08:08,250 --> 05:08:08,729
I need to pee.

1748
05:08:10,409 --> 05:08:11,049
I can't pause.

1749
05:08:16,180 --> 05:08:17,299
Trying to do the next mission or two.

1750
05:08:32,330 --> 05:08:32,970
Firehose.

1751
05:08:42,889 --> 05:08:43,610
All right, let's go.

1752
05:08:44,250 --> 05:08:50,169
I'll let you take care of the lockdown.

1753
05:08:50,169 --> 05:08:51,290
Now, where's the hangar?

1754
05:08:52,439 --> 05:08:53,080
I'm crying.

1755
05:08:53,080 --> 05:08:54,040
Please give us a pause.

1756
05:08:55,479 --> 05:08:56,279
We'll pause after this.

1757
05:08:57,159 --> 05:08:58,700
Oh shit, hold on.

1758
05:08:59,419 --> 05:09:01,180
Pause.

1759
05:09:01,180 --> 05:09:02,220
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1760
05:09:02,220 --> 05:09:02,939
You want to take a break?

1761
05:09:04,330 --> 05:09:04,650
All right.

1762
05:09:04,889 --> 05:09:05,290
Break time.

1763
05:09:06,090 --> 05:09:06,729
Last break.

1764
05:09:06,729 --> 05:09:07,930
We'll do this mission and the one after,

1765
05:09:07,930 --> 05:09:08,889
and then I'm going to call it a night.

1766
05:09:09,700 --> 05:09:10,180
Be right back.

1767
05:11:33,189 --> 05:11:33,909
All right, I'm back.

1768
05:11:35,720 --> 05:11:36,439
Get back to it.

1769
05:11:44,709 --> 05:11:47,110
And it was just going in this door.

1770
05:11:47,110 --> 05:11:50,869
Okay, thank God I fat fingered right

1771
05:11:50,869 --> 05:11:52,310
in the exact same spot I just was.

1772
05:11:53,110 --> 05:12:02,869
Where should I go?

1773
05:12:25,290 --> 05:12:32,099
Where did this guy come from?

1774
05:12:32,099 --> 05:12:32,340
What?

1775
05:12:33,990 --> 05:12:35,110
Jerry voice?

1776
05:12:35,110 --> 05:12:35,990
Jerry.

1777
05:12:35,990 --> 05:12:37,259
I'm Jerry.

1778
05:12:38,060 --> 05:12:39,020
It actually kind of is.

1779
05:12:39,900 --> 05:12:41,580
That's stupid.

1780
05:12:47,959 --> 05:12:48,360
Jerry.

1781
05:12:55,750 --> 05:12:56,549
Oh, Jerry.

1782
05:12:57,270 --> 05:13:11,590
Where am I going?

1783
05:13:11,590 --> 05:13:27,560
Every door is the same door.

1784
05:13:27,560 --> 05:13:30,229
Gain access to the docking bay.

1785
05:13:31,669 --> 05:13:32,310
What?

1786
05:13:32,310 --> 05:13:45,590
Too many fucking doors opening.

1787
05:13:46,229 --> 05:13:49,029
Use the force.

1788
05:13:49,029 --> 05:13:52,439
Yes, I will.

1789
05:13:52,439 --> 05:13:54,020
I promise I'll use the force.

1790
05:13:55,299 --> 05:13:58,889
Like a shotgun.

1791
05:13:59,450 --> 05:14:04,330
This way.

1792
05:14:06,259 --> 05:14:09,979
Um, man, I wish I had a map.

1793
05:14:09,979 --> 05:14:14,360
Is this it?

1794
05:14:26,549 --> 05:14:34,069
Is this it?

1795
05:14:34,069 --> 05:14:36,819
Is this it?

1796
05:14:38,520 --> 05:14:39,959
No, this is the very beginning.

1797
05:14:42,419 --> 05:14:43,779
Oh, God damn it.

1798
05:14:43,779 --> 05:14:45,380
This is the beginning of the game.

1799
05:14:58,860 --> 05:14:59,659
All these hallways.

1800
05:14:59,659 --> 05:15:09,700
There's like 50 doors in here.

1801
05:15:09,700 --> 05:15:10,180
Too many.

1802
05:15:10,180 --> 05:15:14,069
There's too many doors.

1803
05:15:14,069 --> 05:15:14,709
Too many doors.

1804
05:15:14,709 --> 05:15:21,700
Too many elevators.

1805
05:15:21,700 --> 05:15:22,659
They got too many elevators.

1806
05:15:22,659 --> 05:15:23,540
Too many doors and too many rooms

1807
05:15:23,540 --> 05:15:24,180
that lead to nowhere.

1808
05:15:25,560 --> 05:15:27,080
A door and then to go to another door.

1809
05:15:28,200 --> 05:15:29,319
I don't even know what this is.

1810
05:15:30,200 --> 05:15:45,290
What does that do?

1811
05:15:45,770 --> 05:15:50,860
I bet he wasn't expecting that.

1812
05:15:54,919 --> 05:15:55,720
I had to do that?

1813
05:15:56,619 --> 05:15:57,099
Oh, boy.

1814
05:16:13,959 --> 05:16:19,900
I just took down an AT-ST by myself.

1815
05:16:19,900 --> 05:16:20,860
And a guy's gonna come out of the

1816
05:16:20,860 --> 05:16:21,979
the guy's gonna come out of the roof.

1817
05:16:22,540 --> 05:16:23,659
And I'm gonna headshot him.

1818
05:16:23,659 --> 05:16:34,970
Oh, well.

1819
05:16:34,970 --> 05:16:41,930
What do I do now?

1820
05:16:41,930 --> 05:16:50,709
What was that?

1821
05:16:50,709 --> 05:16:52,700
I could hit one.

1822
05:16:52,700 --> 05:16:56,060
The Jedi.

1823
05:16:56,060 --> 05:17:13,319
I'll be...

1824
05:17:18,939 --> 05:17:20,299
I singed my eyebrows.

1825
05:17:20,299 --> 05:17:20,779
Wait.

1826
05:17:20,779 --> 05:17:22,220
This door is opened elsewhere.

1827
05:17:22,220 --> 05:17:22,860
Shit.

1828
05:17:22,860 --> 05:17:23,180
Hold on.

1829
05:17:23,180 --> 05:17:24,459
Did I just kill the guy through the wall

1830
05:17:24,459 --> 05:17:26,459
and now he has to open the door?

1831
05:17:26,459 --> 05:17:29,860
Uh-oh.

1832
05:17:29,860 --> 05:17:30,259
Wait.

1833
05:17:30,259 --> 05:17:37,299
Open up that one.

1834
05:17:37,860 --> 05:17:40,759
No, I'm not Zoft locked.

1835
05:17:51,939 --> 05:17:53,220
Door to get to a door.

1836
05:17:53,220 --> 05:17:53,720
Yep.

1837
05:17:58,950 --> 05:18:08,380
Oh, there he is.

1838
05:18:11,189 --> 05:18:12,630
This Doom guy.

1839
05:18:12,630 --> 05:18:13,830
15, 20 years later.

1840
05:18:29,959 --> 05:18:30,680
What the fuck?

1841
05:18:31,880 --> 05:18:43,779
I'm gonna get in the fucking AT-ST.

1842
05:18:43,779 --> 05:18:44,580
I can't...

1843
05:18:44,580 --> 05:18:45,860
You can't get in an AT-ST.

1844
05:18:52,869 --> 05:18:53,509
Yes, you can.

1845
05:18:53,509 --> 05:18:54,069
Yes, you can.

1846
05:18:54,069 --> 05:18:54,709
Yes, you can.

1847
05:18:54,709 --> 05:18:55,349
Yes, you can.

1848
05:18:55,349 --> 05:18:55,990
Yes, you can.

1849
05:18:55,990 --> 05:18:56,790
Yes, you can.

1850
05:18:56,790 --> 05:18:57,509
That's too late.

1851
05:18:58,150 --> 05:19:00,020
I don't need an AT-ST.

1852
05:19:00,020 --> 05:19:00,500
I have me.

1853
05:19:01,540 --> 05:19:03,139
And I have powerful, powerful...

1854
05:19:03,139 --> 05:19:03,779
I'm gonna sneeze.

1855
05:19:10,860 --> 05:19:12,060
I couldn't mute.

1856
05:19:12,060 --> 05:19:12,939
I tried so hard.

1857
05:19:13,580 --> 05:19:16,409
I fucking...

1858
05:19:17,450 --> 05:19:18,090
I couldn't do it.

1859
05:19:20,790 --> 05:19:21,590
I'm so sorry.

1860
05:19:23,270 --> 05:19:24,310
I can't do it.

1861
05:19:24,310 --> 05:19:24,790
I lied.

1862
05:19:24,790 --> 05:19:25,669
I tried to capture it.

1863
05:19:26,229 --> 05:19:26,709
I lied.

1864
05:19:26,709 --> 05:19:27,590
I'm a liar.

1865
05:19:27,590 --> 05:19:28,229
I'm lying.

1866
05:19:28,229 --> 05:19:28,709
I lied.

1867
05:19:28,709 --> 05:19:29,909
I tried to capture it and I got it.

1868
05:19:40,470 --> 05:19:42,069
It sounds like a dog sneeze.

1869
05:19:43,270 --> 05:19:45,349
It's a dog sneeze.

1870
05:19:45,349 --> 05:19:54,200
It's not like a dog sneeze.

1871
05:19:54,200 --> 05:19:55,240
Where is this saved?

1872
05:19:56,459 --> 05:19:56,939
I don't know.

1873
05:20:05,450 --> 05:20:05,689
No.

1874
05:20:06,490 --> 05:20:08,090
Ah, nice, Ron.

1875
05:20:08,090 --> 05:20:08,810
I'm freaking out.

1876
05:20:08,810 --> 05:20:09,529
I'm losing my mind.

1877
05:20:13,909 --> 05:20:14,310
Okay.

1878
05:20:14,310 --> 05:20:15,270
Hold on, please.

1879
05:20:15,509 --> 05:20:16,229
Just give me a minute, guys.

1880
05:20:16,229 --> 05:20:17,509
I promise I won't do this ever again.

1881
05:20:18,389 --> 05:20:20,389
I promise I won't do this ever again.

1882
05:20:20,389 --> 05:20:20,950
Okay?

1883
05:20:20,950 --> 05:20:22,790
Just let me do one thing and I'll never do it again.

1884
05:20:25,720 --> 05:20:26,680
Nice, Ron.

1885
05:20:29,619 --> 05:20:30,500
Why sneeze?

1886
05:20:30,500 --> 05:20:31,700
I'm not allowed to sneeze.

1887
05:20:32,889 --> 05:20:33,209
Okay.

1888
05:20:33,209 --> 05:20:34,569
I'm so sorry, everybody.

1889
05:20:34,569 --> 05:20:35,770
I don't know if you're probably gonna be like,

1890
05:20:35,770 --> 05:20:36,810
I'm fucking out of here or whatever.

1891
05:20:39,259 --> 05:20:40,540
Nice, Ron.

1892
05:20:40,540 --> 05:20:41,419
Why sneeze?

1893
05:20:41,419 --> 05:20:42,619
I'm not allowed to sneeze.

1894
05:20:43,340 --> 05:20:44,380
Nice, Ron.

1895
05:20:44,380 --> 05:20:45,259
Why sneeze?

1896
05:20:45,259 --> 05:20:46,619
I'm not allowed to sneeze.

1897
05:20:46,619 --> 05:20:47,979
Nice, Ron.

1898
05:20:47,979 --> 05:20:48,779
Nice, Ron.

1899
05:20:48,779 --> 05:20:49,580
Why sneeze?

1900
05:20:49,580 --> 05:20:50,939
I'm not allowed to sneeze.

1901
05:20:50,939 --> 05:20:51,340
Done.

1902
05:20:51,340 --> 05:20:51,979
I'll never do it again.

1903
05:20:51,979 --> 05:20:52,619
I promise.

1904
05:20:52,619 --> 05:20:54,779
I promise you'll never hear me do that ever again.

1905
05:20:54,779 --> 05:20:57,290
I will never do that again.

1906
05:20:57,290 --> 05:20:57,610
Ever.

1907
05:21:02,810 --> 05:21:03,450
Ever.

1908
05:21:03,450 --> 05:21:04,729
You'll never hear me do that again.

1909
05:21:05,450 --> 05:21:13,159
You better not.

1910
05:21:13,159 --> 05:21:14,810
I promise I won't.

1911
05:21:14,810 --> 05:21:15,529
You can trust me.

1912
05:21:15,529 --> 05:21:16,569
I will never do that again.

1913
05:21:38,360 --> 05:21:40,630
What are you doing?

1914
05:21:44,840 --> 05:21:45,400
Where is he?

1915
05:21:46,040 --> 05:21:47,849
Where's the guy that owns this place?

1916
05:21:48,970 --> 05:22:08,060
This looks like a boss fight.

1917
05:22:08,700 --> 05:22:16,790
It is.

1918
05:22:50,490 --> 05:22:54,409
Just let me get up there and I can just shock him.

1919
05:22:57,479 --> 05:22:59,000
Just a shocker.

1920
05:22:59,000 --> 05:23:02,889
A shocker.

1921
05:23:05,900 --> 05:23:06,540
Where is he?

1922
05:23:06,540 --> 05:23:15,130
He's got to get up there and just get him once or twice.

1923
05:23:15,689 --> 05:23:21,340
Is he on?

1924
05:23:21,340 --> 05:23:22,569
Where is he?

1925
05:23:22,569 --> 05:23:24,619
Where is he?

1926
05:23:24,619 --> 05:23:25,340
I don't know where he is.

1927
05:23:25,900 --> 05:23:27,459
Oh, he's up there.

1928
05:23:27,459 --> 05:23:28,259
Okay.

1929
05:23:28,259 --> 05:23:35,779
Where'd you get that weapon?

1930
05:23:36,259 --> 05:23:47,540
God damn it, man.

1931
05:23:48,900 --> 05:23:58,180
I got him.

1932
05:23:58,180 --> 05:23:58,740
I hit him once.

1933
05:24:12,540 --> 05:24:13,500
Whoa.

1934
05:24:13,500 --> 05:24:26,490
He's gonna fall off.

1935
05:24:26,490 --> 05:24:27,529
What the fuck?

1936
05:24:27,529 --> 05:24:31,540
The whole screen shakes.

1937
05:24:31,540 --> 05:24:57,479
Oh my.

1938
05:24:57,479 --> 05:24:57,880
Whoa.

1939
05:24:57,880 --> 05:24:58,439
Easy, easy.

1940
05:24:58,439 --> 05:24:59,000
Don't kill me.

1941
05:25:10,200 --> 05:25:12,229
I just stepped on his head.

1942
05:25:14,419 --> 05:25:17,139
Why did that work more effectively than forest lightning?

1943
05:25:18,419 --> 05:25:23,509
Oh my fucking god.

1944
05:25:25,849 --> 05:25:26,330
Shoot him.

1945
05:25:27,130 --> 05:25:27,369
I...

1946
05:25:49,099 --> 05:25:50,299
Nice, Ron.

1947
05:25:50,299 --> 05:25:54,659
I did it again.

1948
05:25:55,220 --> 05:25:56,259
I did it again.

1949
05:25:57,849 --> 05:25:59,130
No, no, no, no, no.

1950
05:25:59,130 --> 05:25:59,689
It doesn't count.

1951
05:25:59,689 --> 05:26:00,490
That doesn't count.

1952
05:26:00,490 --> 05:26:00,970
That doesn't count.

1953
05:26:01,770 --> 05:26:02,409
It doesn't count.

1954
05:26:02,409 --> 05:26:02,810
That's...

1955
05:26:02,810 --> 05:26:03,450
It doesn't count.

1956
05:26:03,450 --> 05:26:04,250
I had to do the...

1957
05:26:04,250 --> 05:26:04,750
What?

1958
05:26:07,959 --> 05:26:10,520
That doesn't include the sneeze and the...

1959
05:26:17,209 --> 05:26:17,709
Got him.

1960
05:26:35,580 --> 05:26:36,619
No, let's go to the...

1961
05:26:36,619 --> 05:26:37,119
Fuck this.

1962
05:26:42,860 --> 05:26:44,970
You sense anger in me?

1963
05:26:47,619 --> 05:26:48,500
Better be careful.

1964
05:27:32,500 --> 05:27:34,259
Isn't that just a big dead rock?

1965
05:27:34,259 --> 05:27:37,779
It also happens to be the location of one of my father's strongholds.

1966
05:27:37,779 --> 05:27:42,869
You don't add a billion to the debt because I said nice brick.

1967
05:28:02,709 --> 05:28:03,270
Alright.

1968
05:28:03,270 --> 05:28:05,099
Time to be careful.

1969
05:28:10,860 --> 05:28:11,659
F.E. Forces.

1970
05:28:14,729 --> 05:28:26,549
Darth Vader in this game?

1971
05:28:26,549 --> 05:28:27,189
Great.

1972
05:28:27,189 --> 05:28:28,470
Looks like somebody's home.

1973
05:28:29,029 --> 05:28:30,630
Luke sure knows how to pick him.

1974
05:28:30,630 --> 05:28:31,669
Darth Vader in this game?

1975
05:28:31,669 --> 05:28:32,709
Darth Vader in this game?

1976
05:28:35,849 --> 05:28:36,970
Testing my compressor.

1977
05:28:37,610 --> 05:28:42,409
It's acid rain?

1978
05:28:52,250 --> 05:28:53,130
Am I saying ooh?

1979
05:29:05,270 --> 05:29:06,470
Nice, dude.

1980
05:29:06,470 --> 05:29:07,029
Nice.

1981
05:29:07,029 --> 05:29:15,139
What's his name, Kyle?

1982
05:29:15,139 --> 05:29:16,099
Nice, Kyle.

1983
05:29:23,619 --> 05:29:24,119
God.

1984
05:29:24,659 --> 05:29:25,459
Oh, God.

1985
05:29:43,990 --> 05:29:44,790
Is he doing that?

1986
05:29:48,259 --> 05:29:48,759
Ooh.

1987
05:29:50,389 --> 05:29:50,889
Ooh.

1988
05:29:51,189 --> 05:29:51,689
Ooh.

1989
05:29:52,549 --> 05:29:53,049
Ah.

1990
05:29:55,479 --> 05:29:56,119
Ah.

1991
05:29:56,119 --> 05:29:56,619
E.

1992
05:29:56,619 --> 05:29:57,119
Ooh.

1993
05:29:57,119 --> 05:29:58,279
What the fuck?

1994
05:29:58,279 --> 05:29:59,639
Oh my God, it's ruined.

1995
05:30:02,659 --> 05:30:17,549
Coming back.

1996
05:30:33,560 --> 05:30:34,060
Let's go.

1997
05:30:45,619 --> 05:30:54,340
Okay, you can't just run in.

1998
05:30:54,340 --> 05:30:59,900
You cannot just run in.

1999
05:31:21,400 --> 05:31:22,279
This level sucks.

2000
05:31:44,139 --> 05:31:44,700
Do something.

2001
05:31:45,259 --> 05:31:58,340
There it is.

2002
05:31:58,340 --> 05:31:58,900
Save it.

2003
05:31:58,900 --> 05:31:59,400
Go.

2004
05:31:59,700 --> 05:32:17,029
None of them are yours.

2005
05:32:17,029 --> 05:32:20,709
They're all mine.

2006
05:32:22,869 --> 05:32:23,830
None of us are free.

2007
05:32:25,110 --> 05:32:26,150
Yeah, men of the night swap.

2008
05:32:33,560 --> 05:32:34,360
I need help down here.

2009
05:32:34,360 --> 05:32:35,000
It's a Jedi.

2010
05:32:50,569 --> 05:32:51,049
Nice job.

2011
05:32:51,049 --> 05:32:51,450
You did it.

2012
05:32:54,599 --> 05:32:55,639
Excellent work.

2013
05:32:55,639 --> 05:33:00,220
If you can get away, nope.

2014
05:33:00,220 --> 05:33:01,180
Nobody left alive.

2015
05:33:04,779 --> 05:33:05,580
I don't know who you guys are.

2016
05:33:06,380 --> 05:33:07,259
No one left alive.

2017
05:33:09,509 --> 05:33:11,270
True way of the Sith.

2018
05:33:19,209 --> 05:33:40,520
Obtained golden arm.

2019
05:33:40,520 --> 05:33:41,880
You're joking, right?

2020
05:33:42,680 --> 05:33:43,180
Okay.

2021
05:33:45,990 --> 05:33:48,950
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

2022
05:33:49,909 --> 05:33:51,419
Kill, kill.

2023
05:33:55,110 --> 05:33:55,610
Nice.

2024
05:33:56,869 --> 05:34:01,849
Checkpoint.

2025
05:34:01,849 --> 05:34:05,619
Oh, I thought I could hit by the door.

2026
05:34:06,340 --> 05:34:17,779
I can't wait until Darth Vader shows up.

2027
05:34:18,340 --> 05:34:20,740
Shield recharge machine.

2028
05:34:20,740 --> 05:34:22,340
Oh my God.

2029
05:34:22,340 --> 05:34:22,900
I got it.

2030
05:34:22,900 --> 05:34:23,459
I'm right here.

2031
05:34:24,259 --> 05:34:36,900
Where are they at?

2032
05:34:39,880 --> 05:34:41,159
Two Jedi's walking in.

2033
05:34:41,799 --> 05:34:44,409
This lightsaber is weird.

2034
05:34:45,130 --> 05:34:47,380
It's like thin and blue.

2035
05:34:47,380 --> 05:34:48,819
It's not like a regular lightsaber.

2036
05:34:49,459 --> 05:34:53,240
There's a point in the end.

2037
05:34:53,799 --> 05:35:03,900
Oh shit.

2038
05:35:03,900 --> 05:35:04,299
Look out.

2039
05:35:04,939 --> 05:35:11,349
You're going this way?

2040
05:35:19,290 --> 05:35:20,169
Uh, nope.

2041
05:35:20,169 --> 05:35:28,459
Not being in front of the width of his saber.

2042
05:35:29,819 --> 05:35:30,779
All right.

2043
05:35:30,779 --> 05:35:41,669
Shield booster.

2044
05:35:43,099 --> 05:35:43,659
Oh boy.

2045
05:35:43,659 --> 05:35:44,139
Watch out.

2046
05:35:44,139 --> 05:35:44,939
This is a job for you.

2047
05:35:45,580 --> 05:35:48,229
Can he die?

2048
05:35:56,220 --> 05:35:56,720
Nice.

2049
05:35:58,380 --> 05:35:59,419
God, this reminds me.

2050
05:36:03,799 --> 05:36:04,360
Nice one.

2051
05:36:05,799 --> 05:36:06,759
Nice one, James.

2052
05:36:07,479 --> 05:36:08,869
Whatever they do.

2053
05:36:09,590 --> 05:36:10,069
Oh boy.

2054
05:36:10,069 --> 05:36:10,470
I'm going to die.

2055
05:36:10,470 --> 05:36:10,869
I'm going to die.

2056
05:36:10,869 --> 05:36:11,270
I'm going to die.

2057
05:36:11,270 --> 05:36:11,590
I'm going to die.

2058
05:36:11,590 --> 05:36:12,069
I'm going to die.

2059
05:36:22,619 --> 05:36:39,509
Where'd he go?

2060
05:36:39,509 --> 05:37:06,779
I can't just get in the fucking window.

2061
05:37:06,779 --> 05:37:21,189
Come on.

2062
05:37:21,189 --> 05:37:22,069
Music is...

2063
05:37:22,069 --> 05:37:23,610
Where'd he go?

2064
05:37:23,610 --> 05:37:24,250
Why is he not here?

2065
05:37:33,000 --> 05:37:33,560
He's dead?

2066
05:37:33,560 --> 05:37:34,119
No, he's not.

2067
05:37:44,090 --> 05:37:45,540
Take cover.

2068
05:37:45,540 --> 05:37:46,340
Did I fall?

2069
05:37:47,060 --> 05:37:48,419
Yes, they're expecting us now.

2070
05:37:49,380 --> 05:37:53,770
I have to get to that turbo laser and take out the bomber first.

2071
05:38:00,650 --> 05:38:01,049
Okay.

2072
05:38:02,009 --> 05:38:02,650
All right.

2073
05:38:03,529 --> 05:38:03,930
Oh, what?

2074
05:38:03,930 --> 05:38:05,049
He's not even with me.

2075
05:38:06,009 --> 05:38:13,319
I guess it's time to get the turbo laser.

2076
05:38:14,279 --> 05:38:17,700
Is that a big secret?

2077
05:38:17,700 --> 05:38:18,340
He must be...

2078
05:38:19,299 --> 05:38:21,139
My goodness gracious.

2079
05:38:21,139 --> 05:38:21,779
I almost died.

2080
05:38:22,659 --> 05:38:27,450
Is that the guy had like a launch code or something?

2081
05:38:27,450 --> 05:38:28,169
Here are the codes.

2082
05:38:44,040 --> 05:38:45,000
I'd stay here for a sec.

2083
05:38:52,500 --> 05:38:54,500
Die, die, die, die, die.

2084
05:38:55,299 --> 05:38:57,450
What?

2085
05:38:57,450 --> 05:39:00,229
Where the fuck did you come from?

2086
05:39:00,790 --> 05:39:08,819
Well, I could use your help.

2087
05:39:08,819 --> 05:39:09,220
Let's go.

2088
05:39:09,860 --> 05:39:19,189
I could use your help.

2089
05:39:21,540 --> 05:39:34,619
I got this.

2090
05:39:34,619 --> 05:39:35,180
Don't worry.

2091
05:39:35,819 --> 05:39:47,029
You're dealing with a real Sith Lord, but I'm a good guy.

2092
05:39:47,029 --> 05:39:47,830
Oh, fuck.

2093
05:39:47,830 --> 05:39:48,869
Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan, help me.

2094
05:39:48,869 --> 05:39:49,369
Obi-Wan.

2095
05:39:50,150 --> 05:39:52,740
Obi-Wan, get down here.

2096
05:39:52,740 --> 05:39:53,380
Obi.

2097
05:39:53,380 --> 05:39:53,880
Come on.

2098
05:39:59,750 --> 05:40:00,470
Get him.

2099
05:40:00,470 --> 05:40:11,319
Let's cut his arm off.

2100
05:40:11,319 --> 05:40:12,200
Nice job, man.

2101
05:40:14,299 --> 05:40:16,060
Let's do a high five with our lightsabers.

2102
05:40:24,979 --> 05:40:31,540
You're joking.

2103
05:40:31,540 --> 05:40:32,259
Sliced him.

2104
05:40:35,779 --> 05:40:36,740
Nice one, James.

2105
05:40:47,049 --> 05:40:47,770
I missed two times.

2106
05:40:47,770 --> 05:40:48,889
That means you get to live.

2107
05:40:48,889 --> 05:40:59,819
That's who's behind it all.

2108
05:40:59,819 --> 05:41:03,080
That's the wizard behind the fucking Wizard of Oz.

2109
05:41:03,080 --> 05:41:08,500
He just scared me.

2110
05:41:08,500 --> 05:41:26,200
Don't ever come up behind a Jedi when he's in the middle of a fight.

2111
05:41:26,200 --> 05:41:26,759
Wait here.

2112
05:41:26,759 --> 05:41:27,959
Let me know if I get it open.

2113
05:41:36,630 --> 05:41:37,830
A Jedi.

2114
05:41:37,830 --> 05:41:41,349
Did you change clothes?

2115
05:41:46,500 --> 05:41:51,259
All right.

2116
05:41:51,259 --> 05:41:52,139
Okay.

2117
05:41:52,139 --> 05:41:52,540
All right.

2118
05:41:53,099 --> 05:41:54,299
Guess who can do that too?

2119
05:41:55,020 --> 05:41:55,979
I can do that too.

2120
05:41:59,990 --> 05:42:01,110
You know, choking match.

2121
05:42:01,909 --> 05:42:03,430
Yeah, I'm a Sith too, motherfucker.

2122
05:42:03,430 --> 05:42:04,389
You want to see who's stronger?

2123
05:42:04,389 --> 05:42:06,150
Who can choke each other's fucking neck harder?

2124
05:42:07,130 --> 05:42:08,330
Put the lightsabers down.

2125
05:42:08,889 --> 05:42:09,930
Let's do it our way.

2126
05:42:10,810 --> 05:42:22,650
God, give me your best.

2127
05:42:23,209 --> 05:42:26,950
What the hell was that?

2128
05:42:27,669 --> 05:42:31,220
Oh my fucking god.

2129
05:42:31,220 --> 05:42:31,860
I'm his last save.

2130
05:42:38,200 --> 05:42:38,680
See, okay.

2131
05:42:38,680 --> 05:42:42,599
I just went back in time and just surprised the hell out of him.

2132
05:42:43,240 --> 05:42:44,549
He's just like, what?

2133
05:42:44,549 --> 05:42:45,349
How does he know?

2134
05:42:46,310 --> 05:42:48,549
I time traveled and found him.

2135
05:42:48,549 --> 05:42:49,799
Goodbye.

2136
05:42:54,259 --> 05:42:58,950
All right.

2137
05:42:58,950 --> 05:42:59,909
Where's the turbo blaster?

2138
05:43:01,700 --> 05:43:02,500
Blaster time.

2139
05:43:04,099 --> 05:43:04,659
Get on there.

2140
05:43:22,299 --> 05:43:23,180
I died?

2141
05:43:23,180 --> 05:43:34,599
Let's get to the castle.

2142
05:43:35,479 --> 05:43:36,119
Where's the castle?

2143
05:43:36,680 --> 05:43:55,799
All right.

2144
05:43:55,799 --> 05:43:56,360
Made it.

2145
05:43:56,360 --> 05:44:05,049
Turbo.

2146
05:44:05,049 --> 05:44:06,009
Everything's gonna be turbo.

2147
05:44:06,569 --> 05:44:07,909
There's a turbo blaster.

2148
05:44:07,909 --> 05:44:08,869
There's a turbo lifter.

2149
05:44:08,869 --> 05:44:09,590
There's a turbo.

2150
05:44:10,729 --> 05:44:11,529
Turbo graphics.

2151
05:44:21,689 --> 05:44:22,169
We got...

2152
05:44:24,169 --> 05:44:26,099
What do we got, Obi-Wan?

2153
05:44:26,900 --> 05:44:29,349
Turbo.

2154
05:44:40,729 --> 05:44:41,529
Let's go.

2155
05:44:41,529 --> 05:44:43,770
No one ever said being a Jedi was glamorous.

2156
05:44:43,770 --> 05:44:44,650
Actually, a lot of people did.

2157
05:44:45,669 --> 05:44:47,669
Like a dream of every child.

2158
05:44:47,669 --> 05:44:50,069
Like it's like it's the thing that everybody wants to do.

2159
05:44:51,459 --> 05:44:52,580
It's like being a superhero.

2160
05:44:53,779 --> 05:44:54,580
Everyone loves it.

2161
05:45:01,509 --> 05:45:05,110
In fact, it's one of the most glamorous jobs I think in the galaxy.

2162
05:45:05,110 --> 05:45:05,909
Everybody knows you.

2163
05:45:05,909 --> 05:45:06,630
Everybody respects you.

2164
05:45:06,630 --> 05:45:07,669
Everybody like loves you.

2165
05:45:07,669 --> 05:45:08,869
Who talking about?

2166
05:45:08,869 --> 05:45:18,459
How'd you do that?

2167
05:45:19,020 --> 05:45:34,790
What are you just doing out in the trash?

2168
05:45:35,909 --> 05:45:47,909
Did I do it?

2169
05:45:47,909 --> 05:45:48,630
Is it activating?

2170
05:45:49,110 --> 05:45:54,090
Why is there a huge trash base?

2171
05:45:54,650 --> 05:46:15,590
Holy shit, they all freaked out.

2172
05:46:16,310 --> 05:46:19,240
They freaked out when I put the grenades.

2173
05:46:27,930 --> 05:46:29,290
It puts them into a panic.

2174
05:46:30,540 --> 05:46:31,099
How do you...

2175
05:46:31,099 --> 05:46:31,979
He's in the vent.

2176
05:46:35,900 --> 05:46:36,540
He's looking up.

2177
05:46:36,540 --> 05:46:37,740
He doesn't care about this guy.

2178
05:46:37,740 --> 05:46:38,939
He just gets with the guy in the vent.

2179
05:46:45,799 --> 05:46:46,520
Get up there.

2180
05:46:48,119 --> 05:46:49,000
I can get up there.

2181
05:46:49,000 --> 05:46:49,400
Maybe.

2182
05:46:49,959 --> 05:46:50,279
Maybe.

2183
05:46:50,279 --> 05:46:51,080
I think I can do it.

2184
05:46:52,889 --> 05:46:53,290
Can you?

2185
05:46:54,779 --> 05:46:55,419
Maybe he can.

2186
05:46:56,979 --> 05:46:57,779
Come on, do it.

2187
05:47:02,380 --> 05:47:03,740
He has changed his target.

2188
05:47:13,659 --> 05:47:14,619
Oh, I shot him.

2189
05:47:17,369 --> 05:47:18,810
What is this guy doing up there?

2190
05:47:19,610 --> 05:47:20,490
We got to kill this guy.

2191
05:47:21,369 --> 05:47:23,049
Grenade?

2192
05:47:23,049 --> 05:47:23,930
All right, I'm going to throw up.

2193
05:47:23,930 --> 05:47:24,330
All right.

2194
05:47:24,330 --> 05:47:25,610
He's going to freak the fuck out in here.

2195
05:47:26,409 --> 05:47:27,450
I don't have any more grenades.

2196
05:47:28,169 --> 05:47:29,319
Hold on.

2197
05:47:35,419 --> 05:47:36,459
I wish I had grenades.

2198
05:47:37,099 --> 05:47:41,450
He's literally just spawn camping in here.

2199
05:47:42,490 --> 05:47:43,849
Like you're just camping.

2200
05:47:43,849 --> 05:47:50,340
Can we just leave him up here?

2201
05:47:51,060 --> 05:48:00,729
Got him.

2202
05:48:07,080 --> 05:48:07,560
Nice job.

2203
05:48:08,279 --> 05:48:11,560
Uh, Obi-Wan, Kyle, Kyle, Obi.

2204
05:48:16,889 --> 05:48:17,450
You get up this?

2205
05:48:34,409 --> 05:48:40,330
Um, is that wrong?

2206
05:48:40,330 --> 05:48:41,049
Oh, shit.

2207
05:48:41,049 --> 05:48:41,529
Where do you go?

2208
05:48:42,090 --> 05:48:50,520
I went in a circle.

2209
05:48:50,520 --> 05:49:00,180
Yeah, but what's the correct way to go though?

2210
05:49:04,889 --> 05:49:05,529
All right, where do we go?

2211
05:49:17,939 --> 05:49:18,340
Switch?

2212
05:49:18,900 --> 05:49:20,900
I think this door would open.

2213
05:49:27,529 --> 05:49:27,770
Up.

2214
05:49:29,689 --> 05:49:30,650
I did go up, right?

2215
05:49:41,860 --> 05:49:42,900
I just did this, didn't I?

2216
05:49:45,259 --> 05:49:46,139
I just did this.

2217
05:49:53,430 --> 05:49:54,950
I just did this.

2218
05:49:54,950 --> 05:49:55,430
So what?

2219
05:49:55,430 --> 05:49:55,669
No.

2220
05:49:58,580 --> 05:49:59,540
Then do it again.

2221
05:50:11,430 --> 05:50:11,669
Okay.

2222
05:50:13,049 --> 05:50:19,830
I guess that made no sense.

2223
05:50:19,830 --> 05:50:22,229
John Cena is killed thanks to the 20 community subs, John.

2224
05:50:33,319 --> 05:50:33,880
You break it?

2225
05:50:35,450 --> 05:50:36,009
He broke it.

2226
05:50:36,650 --> 05:50:37,209
We're all dead.

2227
05:50:52,900 --> 05:50:53,220
All right.

2228
05:50:53,220 --> 05:50:55,689
I'll turn the water off.

2229
05:50:55,689 --> 05:50:57,349
I'll be right back.

2230
05:50:57,349 --> 05:51:01,110
Just break everything.

2231
05:51:01,110 --> 05:51:03,500
Just drink it.

2232
05:51:07,319 --> 05:51:07,880
Turn the power.

2233
05:51:07,880 --> 05:51:09,080
Find a way to turn off the power.

2234
05:51:09,639 --> 05:51:10,439
You're going to leave him there?

2235
05:51:11,080 --> 05:51:15,860
That'll do it.

2236
05:51:46,979 --> 05:51:48,419
No cat puke.

2237
05:51:48,419 --> 05:51:49,139
Wow.

2238
05:51:49,139 --> 05:51:52,099
I really blew it.

2239
05:51:52,099 --> 05:51:53,540
It was a cat puke opportunity.

2240
05:51:53,540 --> 05:51:53,779
No.

2241
05:51:53,779 --> 05:51:55,299
Sometimes I just don't feel like doing it, man.

2242
05:51:56,020 --> 05:51:57,540
I don't have to do a cat puke every time.

2243
05:51:58,340 --> 05:52:06,200
I'm not just going to cat puke.

2244
05:52:07,080 --> 05:52:09,880
Do you just shoot lighting?

2245
05:52:09,880 --> 05:52:11,529
Are you learning from me?

2246
05:52:25,720 --> 05:52:25,959
Nice.

2247
05:52:27,080 --> 05:52:27,560
Ow.

2248
05:52:27,560 --> 05:52:27,880
Ow.

2249
05:52:27,880 --> 05:52:28,200
Easy.

2250
05:52:31,860 --> 05:52:33,220
I can't take my lightsaber out.

2251
05:52:34,340 --> 05:52:37,159
What's wrong with the lightsaber?

2252
05:52:37,880 --> 05:52:39,220
Did I break it?

2253
05:52:39,220 --> 05:52:40,900
Why can I not take my lightsaber out?

2254
05:52:41,459 --> 05:52:45,819
The battery is dead.

2255
05:52:46,700 --> 05:52:47,740
Oh my god.

2256
05:52:53,080 --> 05:53:00,860
I can't take it any more, man.

2257
05:53:00,860 --> 05:53:01,180
All right.

2258
05:53:01,180 --> 05:53:02,139
I am done after this.

2259
05:53:03,990 --> 05:53:05,189
I'm absolutely done.

2260
05:53:15,060 --> 05:53:15,459
I don't know.

2261
05:53:15,459 --> 05:53:17,139
But apparently you didn't get killed by it.

2262
05:53:23,580 --> 05:53:25,099
Take the fucking lightsaber out.

2263
05:53:37,290 --> 05:53:38,090
Easy.

2264
05:53:38,090 --> 05:53:59,849
Can't just shoot it?

2265
05:54:22,099 --> 05:54:22,819
Okay.

2266
05:54:22,819 --> 05:54:25,400
I thought I had to like disable it or something.

2267
05:54:25,959 --> 05:54:36,389
Got one.

2268
05:54:48,520 --> 05:54:49,240
Got two.

2269
05:54:49,240 --> 05:54:56,790
Oh, he just sucked him in.

2270
05:54:57,430 --> 05:54:58,150
That was crazy.

2271
05:55:04,810 --> 05:55:06,150
You just die.

2272
05:55:06,150 --> 05:55:06,549
Whatever.

2273
05:55:07,110 --> 05:55:10,659
I have that ability too.

2274
05:55:10,659 --> 05:55:10,979
Cool.

2275
05:55:11,619 --> 05:55:16,150
Maybe we'll see it someday.

2276
05:55:17,990 --> 05:55:32,360
This is a long level, huh?

2277
05:55:32,919 --> 05:55:36,169
This definitely ends in a 2v1.

2278
05:55:39,380 --> 05:55:39,939
Absolutely.

2279
05:55:41,540 --> 05:55:42,740
I can't wait for the 2v1.

2280
05:55:43,380 --> 05:55:46,069
Versus like Darth Sidious.

2281
05:55:49,700 --> 05:55:50,180
2v1?

2282
05:55:50,900 --> 05:55:56,889
I'm only a master of evil, Darth.

2283
05:55:59,080 --> 05:56:00,840
I'm only a master of evil, Darth.

2284
05:56:03,099 --> 05:56:03,340
Okay.

2285
05:56:03,340 --> 05:56:03,740
What are we?

2286
05:56:11,740 --> 05:56:26,970
Run.

2287
05:56:26,970 --> 05:56:29,799
Darth the Grinner.

2288
05:56:29,799 --> 05:56:30,599
Oh no.

2289
05:56:30,599 --> 05:56:31,880
Darth Grinner is on the loose.

2290
05:56:42,709 --> 05:56:43,509
Yo.

2291
05:56:43,509 --> 05:56:44,900
Help me kill.

2292
05:56:45,619 --> 05:56:47,619
Where'd he go?

2293
05:56:48,180 --> 05:56:52,250
He's just laughing.

2294
05:56:52,250 --> 05:56:52,970
Yeah, you're joking.

2295
05:56:52,970 --> 05:56:53,450
You're joking.

2296
05:56:53,450 --> 05:56:53,770
You're joking.

2297
05:56:53,770 --> 05:56:54,250
No, dude.

2298
05:56:54,250 --> 05:56:54,810
I'm not joking.

2299
05:56:54,810 --> 05:56:55,290
Get in here.

2300
05:56:59,319 --> 05:56:59,959
You idiot.

2301
05:57:03,060 --> 05:57:03,459
Whatever.

2302
05:57:04,099 --> 05:57:14,779
How do I destroy this?

2303
05:57:27,580 --> 05:57:27,819
Oh.

2304
05:57:36,279 --> 05:57:36,919
Thanks for the tip.

2305
05:57:37,479 --> 05:57:38,409
Appreciate it.

2306
05:57:41,860 --> 05:57:43,380
Not everything is lightning.

2307
05:57:44,020 --> 05:57:44,259
No.

2308
05:57:45,139 --> 05:57:46,419
Everything is lightning.

2309
05:57:47,369 --> 05:57:47,770
Everything.

2310
05:57:49,500 --> 05:57:50,459
Lightning is everything.

2311
05:58:12,759 --> 05:58:13,639
Wait, hold on.

2312
05:58:14,599 --> 05:58:16,360
Did you hear the splat?

2313
05:58:16,360 --> 05:58:18,680
That was a cartoon splat.

2314
05:58:19,639 --> 05:58:22,599
This is a fake person talking to me with a voice changer or something.

2315
05:58:22,599 --> 05:58:22,919
He...

2316
05:58:22,919 --> 05:58:24,119
That was a splat.

2317
05:58:46,470 --> 05:58:47,270
Imperials.

2318
05:58:51,400 --> 05:58:52,439
Oh no.

2319
05:58:52,439 --> 05:58:53,400
A fight chamber.

2320
05:58:54,200 --> 05:59:02,490
The mouse is coming for you.

2321
05:59:03,860 --> 05:59:05,060
I'm playing a video game.

2322
05:59:05,060 --> 05:59:06,500
I'm not screaming the movie.

2323
05:59:07,299 --> 05:59:08,169
It's okay.

2324
05:59:08,169 --> 05:59:08,650
It's allowed.

2325
05:59:09,450 --> 05:59:18,490
Now what?

2326
05:59:18,490 --> 05:59:25,509
Why do people like this dumb Star Wars shit?

2327
05:59:25,509 --> 05:59:34,009
2v1.

2328
05:59:34,090 --> 05:59:34,970
Wait, I'm the boss.

2329
05:59:48,779 --> 05:59:49,340
You idiot.

2330
05:59:50,139 --> 05:59:53,130
Weedlely and Tweedledum.

2331
05:59:53,130 --> 05:59:54,330
Oh, he almost just killed him.

2332
05:59:59,419 --> 06:00:02,779
No, this is one person controlling two people at the same time

2333
06:00:02,779 --> 06:00:04,220
with a controller and the keyboard.

2334
06:00:05,020 --> 06:00:06,459
Doing pretty well considering.

2335
06:00:07,180 --> 06:00:22,419
Lots of Sith Lords.

2336
06:00:33,020 --> 06:00:34,299
Oh, that's another thing I have to ask.

2337
06:00:34,860 --> 06:00:36,220
Do we have a Jedi Academy?

2338
06:00:36,220 --> 06:00:36,540
Is this...

2339
06:00:37,419 --> 06:00:39,419
I'm seeing a lot of red lightsabers.

2340
06:00:40,299 --> 06:00:42,860
Do they have like a Sith Lord Academy?

2341
06:00:43,500 --> 06:00:49,459
Because there's a lot of these little Sith henchmen.

2342
06:00:50,020 --> 06:00:50,500
Do they?

2343
06:00:51,380 --> 06:01:00,569
Oh shit.

2344
06:01:00,569 --> 06:01:01,529
Okay, that was pretty nice.

2345
06:01:19,099 --> 06:01:22,819
You're not supposed to ask that question.

2346
06:01:22,819 --> 06:01:23,540
Well, I just did.

2347
06:01:25,740 --> 06:01:26,939
Yellow means you're a sentinel?

2348
06:01:28,200 --> 06:01:28,520
Cool.

2349
06:01:29,159 --> 06:01:39,110
Let go.

2350
06:01:39,110 --> 06:01:46,220
He's powering up.

2351
06:01:46,860 --> 06:01:48,680
Are you serious?

2352
06:01:48,680 --> 06:01:49,880
You dishonorable.

2353
06:01:50,599 --> 06:01:52,919
Completely out of the fucking goddamn question

2354
06:01:52,919 --> 06:01:54,520
that you would do something like that.

2355
06:01:54,520 --> 06:01:55,720
Unbelievable.

2356
06:01:55,720 --> 06:01:56,680
Demote this guy.

2357
06:01:56,680 --> 06:01:57,400
Get rid of him.

2358
06:01:57,400 --> 06:01:58,520
You're going to shoot a guy in the back

2359
06:01:58,520 --> 06:02:03,130
in the middle of a 1v1 lightsaber Sith versus Jedi battle.

2360
06:02:03,130 --> 06:02:04,330
Are you proud of yourself?

2361
06:02:06,759 --> 06:02:07,720
No honor at all.

2362
06:02:08,840 --> 06:02:09,959
Oh, yeah, you are.

2363
06:02:09,959 --> 06:02:10,919
Yes, nodding.

2364
06:02:10,919 --> 06:02:11,639
Very good.

2365
06:02:11,639 --> 06:02:12,279
Very good.

2366
06:02:12,279 --> 06:02:14,599
I'm going to torture this motherfucker when I get over there.

2367
06:02:29,979 --> 06:02:30,479
Karen.

2368
06:02:31,580 --> 06:02:32,779
Oh, yes, you are nodding.

2369
06:02:32,779 --> 06:02:33,819
Yeah, go ahead and kill me.

2370
06:02:35,459 --> 06:02:36,659
Well, I'm killing you too.

2371
06:02:39,639 --> 06:02:40,919
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

2372
06:02:40,919 --> 06:02:41,959
Oh my god, let go of me.

2373
06:02:45,590 --> 06:02:46,709
Stop that.

2374
06:02:46,709 --> 06:02:52,310
I'm using the powers of light.

2375
06:02:52,869 --> 06:03:06,759
I will use the powers of light to destroy you.

2376
06:03:07,639 --> 06:03:31,220
100 creeper blocks.

2377
06:03:31,220 --> 06:03:31,619
Be careful.

2378
06:04:12,470 --> 06:04:13,029
Let me go.

2379
06:04:32,380 --> 06:04:32,860
Shock him.

2380
06:04:32,860 --> 06:04:33,340
Shock him.

2381
06:04:33,340 --> 06:04:33,740
Shock him.

2382
06:04:33,740 --> 06:04:34,139
Shock him.

2383
06:04:34,139 --> 06:04:35,099
Shock him.

2384
06:04:35,099 --> 06:04:37,240
Give me that back.

2385
06:04:45,459 --> 06:04:46,020
Through the wall.

2386
06:04:46,020 --> 06:04:46,900
You can do that through the wall.

2387
06:04:46,900 --> 06:04:47,619
No, you can't.

2388
06:04:47,619 --> 06:04:48,119
Lie.

2389
06:04:53,349 --> 06:04:53,909
There it is.

2390
06:04:53,909 --> 06:04:54,310
Got it.

2391
06:04:54,310 --> 06:04:55,029
1v1 duel.

2392
06:04:55,029 --> 06:04:55,529
You're dead.

2393
06:04:59,590 --> 06:05:00,630
Give him the jock jock.

2394
06:05:00,630 --> 06:05:01,349
Shock jock him.

2395
06:05:08,680 --> 06:05:09,799
Oh shit, there's another.

2396
06:05:10,520 --> 06:05:20,669
Bye.

2397
06:05:20,970 --> 06:05:22,700
Where's that Sith Jedi?

2398
06:05:23,419 --> 06:05:25,750
Where'd he go?

2399
06:05:25,750 --> 06:05:30,400
There he is.

2400
06:05:49,180 --> 06:05:51,580
Big mistake letting go of your blade like that.

2401
06:05:51,580 --> 06:05:52,459
What an idiot.

2402
06:05:52,459 --> 06:05:55,139
Completely opening yourself up to an attack.

2403
06:05:55,700 --> 06:06:04,869
Why is chat rioting?

2404
06:06:04,869 --> 06:06:05,369
What do you mean?

2405
06:06:24,040 --> 06:06:24,919
I have to fight two-

2406
06:06:24,919 --> 06:06:25,639
No, I'm leaving.

2407
06:06:26,439 --> 06:06:31,419
Yeah, you come get me.

2408
06:06:34,299 --> 06:06:35,419
Oh shit, this is a bad idea.

2409
06:06:42,650 --> 06:06:44,250
Where is my friend?

2410
06:06:44,250 --> 06:06:46,650
I have to fight three of these guys at the same time?

2411
06:06:46,650 --> 06:06:47,610
This is unfair.

2412
06:06:49,060 --> 06:06:49,779
Really unfair.

2413
06:06:50,659 --> 06:06:56,470
Oh, I can hide over here.

2414
06:07:08,950 --> 06:07:11,500
They have trouble in tight spaces.

2415
06:07:16,659 --> 06:07:18,500
Oh my god, I don't even know what's happening.

2416
06:07:21,909 --> 06:07:22,409
They-

2417
06:07:22,950 --> 06:07:23,990
They're not powerful.

2418
06:07:23,990 --> 06:07:26,709
You don't think I'm fighting four of you guys at the same time?

2419
06:07:28,439 --> 06:07:32,119
And a choker guy and a flying mech suit.

2420
06:07:32,919 --> 06:07:35,479
I think I'm pretty powerful.

2421
06:07:35,479 --> 06:07:37,159
I think I'm very powerful, actually.

2422
06:07:37,959 --> 06:07:51,529
Oh my god, die.

2423
06:08:01,720 --> 06:08:03,479
Holy shit, he's got lightning too.

2424
06:08:03,479 --> 06:08:03,979
Nice.

2425
06:08:04,520 --> 06:08:05,159
Mine's blue.

2426
06:08:05,159 --> 06:08:06,119
That means mine's good.

2427
06:08:10,700 --> 06:08:11,659
Hold on, hold on.

2428
06:08:11,659 --> 06:08:12,700
Wait, get out of here.

2429
06:08:12,700 --> 06:08:27,400
I'm busy right now.

2430
06:08:41,669 --> 06:08:42,630
Jesus, all right.

2431
06:08:42,630 --> 06:08:43,430
So what do you say?

2432
06:08:43,430 --> 06:08:44,470
You're going to catch up to me soon?

2433
06:08:44,470 --> 06:08:45,029
Doing what?

2434
06:08:45,029 --> 06:09:02,650
Where is he?

2435
06:09:02,650 --> 06:09:08,020
He's going to just come in on a giant fucking ship, isn't he?

2436
06:09:23,939 --> 06:09:26,099
This level is way too long, by the way.

2437
06:09:26,099 --> 06:09:29,209
It's like extended level.

2438
06:09:29,209 --> 06:09:37,419
What does he want me to do?

2439
06:09:40,150 --> 06:09:45,220
Back up there?

2440
06:09:45,220 --> 06:09:46,099
Go up?

2441
06:09:46,099 --> 06:10:03,990
Oh, that blends in, but that blends in.

2442
06:10:03,990 --> 06:10:04,709
That blends in.

2443
06:10:05,270 --> 06:10:10,360
I don't even care about that guy.

2444
06:10:11,000 --> 06:10:12,759
I don't even want to fight him.

2445
06:10:12,759 --> 06:10:13,639
Like, I don't care.

2446
06:10:20,389 --> 06:10:22,470
All right, this is the big climax right here.

2447
06:10:22,869 --> 06:10:28,279
This is it.

2448
06:10:46,169 --> 06:10:48,630
What's wrong with my game?

2449
06:10:49,270 --> 06:10:49,990
What's wrong with the game?

2450
06:10:51,830 --> 06:10:52,630
What's wrong with my game?

2451
06:10:59,139 --> 06:11:00,419
It's kind of stretched.

2452
06:11:05,479 --> 06:11:07,000
I got drugged by the droid.

2453
06:11:07,000 --> 06:11:07,479
Oh, okay.

2454
06:11:17,180 --> 06:11:27,159
Get.

2455
06:11:27,159 --> 06:11:28,599
Oh, I hate that.

2456
06:11:28,599 --> 06:11:31,319
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

2457
06:11:31,319 --> 06:11:38,180
I'm hungry.

2458
06:11:38,180 --> 06:11:41,369
That run.

2459
06:11:42,009 --> 06:11:43,290
Oh, damn it.

2460
06:11:43,290 --> 06:11:45,369
That fucking run freaked me out, man.

2461
06:11:46,009 --> 06:11:54,229
Get that chip.

2462
06:11:54,229 --> 06:11:58,700
I'm for a whopper?

2463
06:11:58,700 --> 06:11:59,259
No, thank you.

2464
06:12:01,479 --> 06:12:02,919
Rather, never mind.

2465
06:12:03,000 --> 06:12:04,360
It's like, those things.

2466
06:12:04,360 --> 06:12:05,880
I hate this stupid fucking shield.

2467
06:12:30,759 --> 06:12:31,639
Eat lead.

2468
06:12:32,439 --> 06:12:38,020
Oh, wait, what?

2469
06:12:38,020 --> 06:12:39,619
They have lightsabers now?

2470
06:12:40,419 --> 06:12:43,939
Since when do they have lightsabers?

2471
06:12:43,939 --> 06:12:44,900
Oh, they did once.

2472
06:12:59,110 --> 06:13:00,150
They fly now?

2473
06:13:00,709 --> 06:13:02,250
What's that from?

2474
06:13:02,250 --> 06:13:13,029
You know, they keep playing the Darth Vader song, but he's not in the game.

2475
06:13:25,580 --> 06:13:30,840
Bye.

2476
06:13:30,840 --> 06:13:35,139
No, no, I don't want to do that right now.

2477
06:13:39,580 --> 06:13:45,990
Oh, it's a double wielding lightsaber foe.

2478
06:13:59,979 --> 06:14:01,659
Oh, I thought I was going to get right in the middle.

2479
06:14:01,659 --> 06:14:07,060
What the fuck is this?

2480
06:14:07,779 --> 06:14:12,020
Is this going to be screaming?

2481
06:14:14,950 --> 06:14:15,430
Okay, run.

2482
06:14:15,990 --> 06:14:17,380
There's a lot of trash.

2483
06:14:17,380 --> 06:14:18,819
Holy shit, you have tons of trash.

2484
06:14:19,540 --> 06:14:39,130
Yeah, try to block all those.

2485
06:14:48,860 --> 06:14:53,380
Oh, what a one-line.

2486
06:14:53,380 --> 06:14:55,779
Here comes Darth Vader.

2487
06:14:56,740 --> 06:15:02,069
Treat it like doom.

2488
06:15:19,619 --> 06:15:21,139
May the force be with you.

2489
06:15:24,180 --> 06:15:24,680
What?

2490
06:15:29,500 --> 06:15:29,979
Oh, what?

2491
06:15:31,099 --> 06:15:34,900
Did they like phone a friend or something?

2492
06:15:34,900 --> 06:15:38,840
How did you come down here?

2493
06:15:39,639 --> 06:15:40,759
Was he supposed to be the whole time?

2494
06:15:41,560 --> 06:15:45,770
Was he supposed to be here the entire time?

2495
06:15:52,229 --> 06:15:54,229
Someone didn't like Vader much.

2496
06:15:56,040 --> 06:16:01,240
Wait, is that Kyle?

2497
06:16:02,040 --> 06:16:02,919
That's not Kyle.

2498
06:16:03,479 --> 06:16:09,619
Somebody just fell off.

2499
06:16:12,709 --> 06:16:13,509
What did he do?

2500
06:16:15,990 --> 06:16:17,029
How did he fall?

2501
06:16:26,790 --> 06:16:27,189
I can't.

2502
06:16:33,619 --> 06:16:34,979
He slipped on something.

2503
06:16:34,979 --> 06:16:36,979
I mean, how?

2504
06:16:43,990 --> 06:16:44,549
I win.

2505
06:16:46,900 --> 06:16:47,779
Guys, did you just hear it?

2506
06:17:09,450 --> 06:17:38,439
All right, I'm going to shoot a fake one.

2507
06:17:38,439 --> 06:17:39,080
Here's the real one.

2508
06:17:39,959 --> 06:17:59,509
Oh, god damn it.

2509
06:17:59,509 --> 06:18:00,549
I'm trying to stick it on the wall.

2510
06:18:01,430 --> 06:18:02,790
This is a fucking mistake.

2511
06:18:03,509 --> 06:18:12,599
All right, now why don't you come over here and get me, you fucking punk.

2512
06:18:13,159 --> 06:18:16,810
Oh, look at this.

2513
06:18:16,810 --> 06:18:17,529
Come and get me.

2514
06:18:18,330 --> 06:18:33,610
Stronger, no.

2515
06:18:34,650 --> 06:18:35,450
Smarter, maybe.

2516
06:18:40,700 --> 06:18:41,180
Pretty good.

2517
06:18:45,049 --> 06:18:47,290
Never take your blade down.

2518
06:18:47,290 --> 06:18:49,529
People always do that and it's the stupidest idea.

2519
06:18:50,569 --> 06:18:51,529
You just look silly.

2520
06:19:05,400 --> 06:19:06,759
How many times are they going to do that?

2521
06:19:20,650 --> 06:19:22,009
The MCA sounds.

2522
06:19:27,669 --> 06:19:30,790
Oh, this one has the Darth Maul.

2523
06:19:47,430 --> 06:19:49,659
Darth Maul-ding.

2524
06:19:50,619 --> 06:19:54,259
What? Did I win?

2525
06:19:55,930 --> 06:19:56,409
Okay, I got him.

2526
06:20:14,869 --> 06:20:15,430
Oh, shit.

2527
06:20:15,430 --> 06:20:17,450
This is like the chancellor, the emperor.

2528
06:20:28,490 --> 06:20:29,610
Yeah, of course he was bad.

2529
06:20:31,689 --> 06:20:33,209
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Underground.

2530
06:20:39,459 --> 06:20:40,259
Darth Rosh.

2531
06:20:51,209 --> 06:20:53,349
Rosh, what are you saying?

2532
06:20:53,909 --> 06:20:54,869
You're a Jedi.

2533
06:20:57,159 --> 06:20:59,860
No, I am.

2534
06:20:59,860 --> 06:21:00,900
Enough talk.

2535
06:21:01,540 --> 06:21:06,740
Rosh, destroy this puny Jedi so we can complete our task.

2536
06:21:06,740 --> 06:21:08,020
Yeah, I think I know what it's like.

2537
06:21:08,020 --> 06:21:08,500
Yes.

2538
06:21:08,500 --> 06:21:09,700
I'm also Darkseid.

2539
06:21:09,700 --> 06:21:15,610
If you're too weak to join us, Jaden, we can't let you stand in our way.

2540
06:21:16,409 --> 06:21:16,810
Red.

2541
06:21:18,009 --> 06:21:19,610
Oh, no, it's red.

2542
06:21:22,360 --> 06:21:23,639
Oh, no, it's red.

2543
06:21:37,400 --> 06:21:44,950
This guy, they're back facing me.

2544
06:21:50,549 --> 06:21:51,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2545
06:22:35,080 --> 06:22:36,119
He's just up there.

2546
06:22:36,840 --> 06:22:38,619
He's gonna fall.

2547
06:22:38,619 --> 06:22:39,340
He's gonna fall.

2548
06:22:39,340 --> 06:22:40,619
He's gonna fall, guys.

2549
06:22:40,619 --> 06:22:42,860
He's gonna fall and we're gonna all laugh at it.

2550
06:22:42,860 --> 06:22:43,580
He's gonna fall.

2551
06:22:46,389 --> 06:22:47,349
Get down from there.

2552
06:22:47,349 --> 06:22:47,750
Come on.

2553
06:22:50,819 --> 06:22:51,779
Come on, fall.

2554
06:22:52,900 --> 06:22:53,700
Fall already.

2555
06:22:59,590 --> 06:23:00,549
He ain't gonna fall.

2556
06:23:00,549 --> 06:23:01,189
Fall already.

2557
06:23:02,709 --> 06:23:07,159
He just fall down already.

2558
06:23:13,029 --> 06:23:13,830
I knew he was coming.

2559
06:23:13,830 --> 06:23:14,869
I knew it was still funny.

2560
06:23:19,459 --> 06:23:21,430
He hit his head on.

2561
06:23:24,500 --> 06:23:26,419
He even laid out for that.

2562
06:23:26,419 --> 06:23:28,020
He didn't even lay out that far.

2563
06:23:29,139 --> 06:23:31,939
At least try to land on your knees and roll, man.

2564
06:23:31,939 --> 06:23:35,860
You just went completely belly flop on your stomach.

2565
06:23:36,580 --> 06:23:39,580
At least give yourself the opportunity.

2566
06:23:40,299 --> 06:23:42,500
You're not like cave in your chest.

2567
06:23:43,139 --> 06:23:47,020
Why is he blue?

2568
06:23:48,360 --> 06:23:48,840
I can't.

2569
06:23:59,799 --> 06:24:00,680
It's a hologram.

2570
06:24:07,319 --> 06:24:07,799
Take this.

2571
06:24:08,360 --> 06:24:14,060
Oh, he's green now.

2572
06:24:14,060 --> 06:24:16,459
That means I have force power.

2573
06:24:34,090 --> 06:24:34,409
Shit.

2574
06:24:35,720 --> 06:24:37,720
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.

2575
06:24:38,680 --> 06:24:39,159
Get away.

2576
06:24:39,159 --> 06:24:40,119
Get the fuck away from me.

2577
06:24:40,119 --> 06:24:41,159
Get away, mom.

2578
06:24:45,430 --> 06:24:50,860
Oh, my fucking God.

2579
06:24:50,860 --> 06:24:52,220
Don't let him kill you.

2580
06:24:52,220 --> 06:24:52,939
He's shitty.

2581
06:24:52,939 --> 06:24:53,500
He's horrible.

2582
06:24:53,500 --> 06:24:55,900
He's like the little pretend antagonist.

2583
06:25:01,770 --> 06:25:02,090
All right.

2584
06:25:17,799 --> 06:25:18,599
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

2585
06:25:38,860 --> 06:25:39,099
Fuck.

2586
06:25:39,099 --> 06:25:40,299
I was trying to be dishonorable.

2587
06:25:48,340 --> 06:26:14,630
This guy's fucking running.

2588
06:26:15,830 --> 06:26:22,419
These guys don't even have any.

2589
06:26:23,060 --> 06:26:31,029
Where's rash?

2590
06:26:31,029 --> 06:26:48,040
I'm going to wait until it's 100 and then do it.

2591
06:26:53,060 --> 06:26:53,779
Die for rash.

2592
06:26:57,689 --> 06:27:01,880
All right.

2593
06:27:01,880 --> 06:27:02,759
Back up, back up, back up.

2594
06:27:02,759 --> 06:27:03,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2595
06:27:12,939 --> 06:27:16,540
And big head tennis.

2596
06:27:17,099 --> 06:27:18,680
That's what you're looking for.

2597
06:27:18,680 --> 06:27:20,200
You're looking for big head tennis.

2598
06:27:20,200 --> 06:27:33,979
I don't know where it was.

2599
06:27:36,279 --> 06:27:36,759
There it is.

2600
06:27:37,319 --> 06:27:39,799
Do it.

2601
06:27:39,799 --> 06:27:49,529
I would give up my apprentice so easily.

2602
06:27:49,529 --> 06:27:50,729
He's standing there the whole time.

2603
06:27:50,729 --> 06:27:53,290
You should have killed me when you had the chance, Katarn.

2604
06:27:53,849 --> 06:27:56,490
Your pathetic Jedi mercy is a weakness

2605
06:27:56,490 --> 06:27:58,330
that shall cost you your life

2606
06:27:59,130 --> 06:28:01,849
and the life of your academy's students.

2607
06:28:03,740 --> 06:28:06,139
But not you, my dear rash.

2608
06:28:07,020 --> 06:28:08,419
Come.

2609
06:28:08,419 --> 06:28:09,939
Yes, Tavian.

2610
06:28:09,939 --> 06:28:10,580
Rash, no.

2611
06:28:12,020 --> 06:28:19,290
Friendship cannot compare with the power of the dark side.

2612
06:28:19,290 --> 06:28:20,250
I know.

2613
06:28:20,250 --> 06:28:22,490
I'm incredibly strong in the dark side.

2614
06:28:22,490 --> 06:28:26,330
Stealing scraps of the force like some sort of intergalactic parasite.

2615
06:28:26,330 --> 06:28:29,369
Spare me your self-righteous pity, Katarn.

2616
06:28:29,369 --> 06:28:31,930
You may have shamed me when you spared my life.

2617
06:28:31,930 --> 06:28:34,569
I got much better lightning hands than anybody in this room.

2618
06:28:34,569 --> 06:28:35,450
Please.

2619
06:28:35,450 --> 06:28:38,250
Now, master.

2620
06:28:38,250 --> 06:28:44,009
One who has promised me that destroyed the Jedi.

2621
06:28:44,009 --> 06:28:47,209
Ragnos, what can a dead Sith Lord give you?

2622
06:28:47,849 --> 06:28:50,409
Everything I have ever wanted.

2623
06:28:51,529 --> 06:28:53,659
Not that I'm to see.

2624
06:28:55,639 --> 06:28:56,139
What?

2625
06:28:56,680 --> 06:29:00,259
It's quite the drop.

2626
06:29:00,259 --> 06:29:01,299
It's quite the fumble.

2627
06:29:01,779 --> 06:29:09,180
I can't keep this up for long.

2628
06:29:09,180 --> 06:29:09,680
Hold on.

2629
06:29:10,459 --> 06:29:17,240
I don't even know what just happened.

2630
06:29:18,840 --> 06:29:22,259
We looked everywhere after getting free.

2631
06:29:22,259 --> 06:29:24,979
But Tavian had already taken Rosh and fled.

2632
06:29:24,979 --> 06:29:25,479
Sitting.

2633
06:29:25,479 --> 06:29:27,380
So now we know who was leading this cult.

2634
06:29:27,380 --> 06:29:30,580
But that doesn't explain why there are so many dark force users.

2635
06:29:30,580 --> 06:29:32,180
Some of Desan's left over re-

2636
06:29:32,180 --> 06:29:33,779
A lot wrong with what just happened there, I think.

2637
06:29:33,779 --> 06:29:36,340
As for the cultists, Jaden has a theory.

2638
06:29:36,340 --> 06:29:40,020
If the scepter can store the force, maybe it can release it too.

2639
06:29:40,819 --> 06:29:44,020
Tavian could be using it to empower her followers.

2640
06:29:44,020 --> 06:29:46,819
Corrupting disciples with the dark side of the force?

2641
06:29:47,380 --> 06:29:48,580
That would explain a lot.

2642
06:29:49,220 --> 06:29:50,900
Did you get a good look at the scepter?

2643
06:29:50,900 --> 06:29:51,619
Yeah.

2644
06:29:51,619 --> 06:29:53,700
I bet it belonged to Ragnos.

2645
06:29:53,700 --> 06:29:56,580
We need to figure out what Tavian plans on doing with it.

2646
06:29:56,580 --> 06:29:57,939
If we're going to stop her.

2647
06:29:57,939 --> 06:29:58,439
Agreed.

2648
06:29:59,479 --> 06:30:02,439
You are going to need to build a new lightsaber to replace the one you lost.

2649
06:30:02,439 --> 06:30:02,939
Oh!

2650
06:30:03,560 --> 06:30:05,799
Try to figure out what Tavian's next move is.

2651
06:30:08,950 --> 06:30:09,750
Sir?

2652
06:30:09,750 --> 06:30:10,470
Jaden.

2653
06:30:10,470 --> 06:30:13,189
You handled yourself exceptionally well on Vajun.

2654
06:30:13,189 --> 06:30:17,110
To confront three dark Jedi and defeat them took bravery and skill.

2655
06:30:17,750 --> 06:30:18,619
Efforts?

2656
06:30:19,080 --> 06:30:22,040
I feel you are ready to join our ranks as a Jedi Knight.

2657
06:30:22,040 --> 06:30:22,540
Oh me?

2658
06:30:22,540 --> 06:30:23,319
Congratulations.

2659
06:30:23,319 --> 06:30:24,680
Yes, Master Skywalker.

2660
06:30:25,400 --> 06:30:26,200
Thank you both.

2661
06:30:29,750 --> 06:30:30,250
Jaden.

2662
06:30:30,250 --> 06:30:31,590
When do I get fired?

2663
06:30:31,590 --> 06:30:34,069
I felt the anger seething inside you.

2664
06:30:34,069 --> 06:30:39,259
You may be a Jedi Knight now, but you still must beware of the dark side.

2665
06:30:39,259 --> 06:30:40,299
Yes, Kyle.

2666
06:30:40,299 --> 06:30:41,580
I'll try not to fail you.

2667
06:30:42,060 --> 06:30:46,790
I'll try.

2668
06:30:47,509 --> 06:30:48,630
Oh, yep.

2669
06:30:49,750 --> 06:30:50,709
Dual sabers.

2670
06:30:51,669 --> 06:30:52,950
Two-handed saber.

2671
06:30:55,900 --> 06:30:56,939
Oh, what would I have?

2672
06:30:57,979 --> 06:31:05,500
I would have one big orange dual saber.

2673
06:31:14,779 --> 06:31:15,279
Or...

2674
06:31:17,700 --> 06:31:19,060
German 985 build.

2675
06:31:19,779 --> 06:31:28,409
Why can't I have three?

2676
06:31:28,409 --> 06:31:43,319
The Joker?

2677
06:31:44,119 --> 06:31:45,159
What do you mean the Joker?

2678
06:31:46,740 --> 06:31:47,540
Oh, that's...

2679
06:31:47,540 --> 06:31:48,979
Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?

2680
06:31:49,540 --> 06:31:54,380
It is the Joker.

2681
06:31:55,340 --> 06:32:09,180
I'm going big orange that one.

2682
06:32:25,529 --> 06:32:29,209
Okay, I'm done.

2683
06:32:29,209 --> 06:32:30,650
But I just want to see what it looks like.

2684
06:32:34,330 --> 06:32:41,319
These are all level three already.

2685
06:32:43,500 --> 06:32:44,139
Force drain.

2686
06:32:44,939 --> 06:32:53,619
Drain life essence.

2687
06:32:54,180 --> 06:33:01,860
All right, I just want to see what it is.

2688
06:33:01,860 --> 06:33:02,659
I'm not playing this mission.

2689
06:33:02,659 --> 06:33:03,159
I just want to see.

2690
06:33:07,319 --> 06:33:08,840
Please don't ever stream again.

2691
06:33:08,840 --> 06:33:09,799
Well, I am.

2692
06:33:09,799 --> 06:33:10,299
I'm sorry.

2693
06:33:11,389 --> 06:33:12,029
Disappoint you.

2694
06:33:13,630 --> 06:33:14,270
Yeah, I'm done.

2695
06:33:16,240 --> 06:33:17,279
I will be back.

2696
06:33:17,279 --> 06:33:18,479
I'll see you guys on...

2697
06:33:21,150 --> 06:33:23,069
I'll see you guys on Saturday afternoon.

2698
06:33:23,709 --> 06:33:31,849
Oh, there it is.

2699
06:33:31,849 --> 06:33:38,830
It's one of those big demons, right?

2700
06:33:50,479 --> 06:33:55,389
I just want to swing it around for a second

2701
06:33:55,389 --> 06:33:56,110
and then end the stream.

2702
06:33:56,750 --> 06:33:58,639
Yeah, thanks for watching, everybody.

2703
06:34:00,080 --> 06:34:01,360
You can eat him or not?

2704
06:34:01,360 --> 06:34:02,159
Okay, really?

2705
06:34:02,159 --> 06:34:03,919
That was a lot of build-up, I was going to say.

2706
06:34:04,799 --> 06:34:05,360
Get on with it.

2707
06:34:16,319 --> 06:34:17,759
You care about me?

2708
06:34:23,709 --> 06:34:24,590
Who's the intruder?

2709
06:34:24,909 --> 06:34:26,110
There's a rancor over here.

2710
06:34:26,110 --> 06:34:26,830
What are you doing?

2711
06:34:32,560 --> 06:34:33,599
Look, I know we're enemies,

2712
06:34:33,599 --> 06:34:34,639
but there's something...

2713
06:34:34,639 --> 06:34:35,200
Look.

2714
06:34:35,200 --> 06:34:35,840
Look what's over here.

2715
06:34:53,080 --> 06:34:55,720
He goes up and just starts punching.

2716
06:34:55,720 --> 06:34:56,439
Did you see that?

2717
06:34:56,439 --> 06:34:58,040
He was like, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

2718
06:35:02,479 --> 06:35:02,880
Hold on.

2719
06:35:02,880 --> 06:35:03,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2720
06:35:03,360 --> 06:35:04,959
Wait, I got this guy right here.

2721
06:35:04,959 --> 06:35:05,840
This could be...

2722
06:35:05,840 --> 06:35:06,400
I want to see.

2723
06:35:07,360 --> 06:35:09,119
There's an opportunity for him to break through here

2724
06:35:09,119 --> 06:35:10,560
and fight this guy, maybe?

2725
06:35:11,520 --> 06:35:23,799
Okay, let's see what happens.

2726
06:35:23,799 --> 06:35:27,020
Dad, why is he coming after me?

2727
06:35:28,060 --> 06:35:28,560
Really?

2728
06:35:29,099 --> 06:35:33,799
I was dead a long time ago, dude.

2729
06:35:34,520 --> 06:35:35,770
Please, eat me.

2730
06:35:35,770 --> 06:35:36,650
Just eat me.

2731
06:35:36,650 --> 06:35:37,369
He's thinking about you.

2732
06:35:37,369 --> 06:35:38,650
Mmm, this is...

2733
06:35:38,650 --> 06:35:40,009
This medicine is delicious.

2734
06:35:40,009 --> 06:35:40,729
Let me try it.

2735
06:35:41,290 --> 06:35:41,790
Mmm.

2736
06:35:43,360 --> 06:35:43,860
No!

2737
06:35:44,479 --> 06:35:45,279
It's too sour.

2738
06:35:45,919 --> 06:35:51,840
All right, I'm done.

2739
06:35:56,509 --> 06:35:58,509
I will see you guys on Saturday.

2740
06:35:59,069 --> 06:36:00,799
I'm not sure what we're going to do on Saturday,

2741
06:36:01,439 --> 06:36:02,520
but we'll see.

2742
06:36:03,319 --> 06:36:08,110
I mean, we could...

2743
06:36:08,110 --> 06:36:08,909
I could finish this,

2744
06:36:10,380 --> 06:36:12,380
but how much more time do I really have in this game?

2745
06:36:13,180 --> 06:36:17,069
What's the...

2746
06:36:17,069 --> 06:36:18,750
Anybody know how much time is left?

2747
06:36:18,750 --> 06:36:21,900
Like two or three hours?

2748
06:36:21,900 --> 06:36:22,779
Is it just this,

2749
06:36:22,779 --> 06:36:24,060
or is there another section after this?

2750
06:36:24,700 --> 06:36:34,159
This is the last section?

2751
06:36:34,159 --> 06:36:34,720
Okay.

2752
06:36:34,720 --> 06:36:35,599
Yeah, here's what we'll do.

2753
06:36:36,720 --> 06:36:37,919
On Saturday, we're going to finish this,

2754
06:36:38,560 --> 06:36:41,419
because I'm not going to be a never-finished-games Andy,

2755
06:36:42,139 --> 06:36:42,860
right?

2756
06:36:42,860 --> 06:36:45,529
Because this is fun and funny.

2757
06:36:45,529 --> 06:36:47,369
So we're going to finish this game,

2758
06:36:48,490 --> 06:36:50,090
and then we'll pivot to something else

2759
06:36:50,090 --> 06:36:50,889
for a couple hours, too,

2760
06:36:51,610 --> 06:36:52,490
depending on how long it takes.

2761
06:36:54,439 --> 06:36:55,799
I will see you guys on Saturday.

2762
06:36:55,799 --> 06:36:56,759
Thanks for watching, everybody.

2763
06:36:57,400 --> 06:36:58,479
We'll see you soon.

2764
06:36:59,200 --> 06:37:02,479
This has been Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy,

2765
06:37:03,279 --> 06:37:05,759
and we'll see you Saturday.

2766
06:37:06,159 --> 06:37:12,880
Here come the subs that came in today.

2767
06:37:12,880 --> 06:37:14,189
Thanks, everybody.

2768
06:37:14,189 --> 06:37:14,750
Kind of long.

2769
06:37:15,950 --> 06:37:19,229
Longer than recently, usual, you know,

2770
06:37:19,229 --> 06:37:21,000
but I was having fun.

2771
06:37:21,000 --> 06:37:26,779
Hope you have a good start to your weekend.

2772
06:37:26,779 --> 06:37:33,419
We'll see you soon.

2773
06:37:36,299 --> 06:37:36,939
Let's do a raid.

2774
06:37:36,939 --> 06:37:37,740
Yeah, let's raid somebody.

2775
06:37:39,020 --> 06:37:40,939
Who do we got streaming right now?

2776
06:37:40,939 --> 06:37:41,439
Let's see.

2777
06:37:45,930 --> 06:37:47,930
Quite a few people are streaming right now.

2778
06:37:50,299 --> 06:37:51,580
Quite a few people.

2779
06:38:02,700 --> 06:38:03,979
I'm going to dump you on Italics.

2780
06:38:03,979 --> 06:38:05,580
Italics is playing Cooking Simulator,

2781
06:38:06,139 --> 06:38:07,659
and I mean, that game is just fun.

2782
06:38:07,659 --> 06:38:08,939
I'm not sure he's ever played it before.

2783
06:38:08,939 --> 06:38:13,360
Maybe go say hello to Italics.

2784
06:38:13,360 --> 06:38:14,400
Cooking Simulator.

2785
06:38:18,909 --> 06:38:20,270
I will see you guys on Saturday.

2786
06:38:20,270 --> 06:38:20,990
Good night.

2787
06:38:22,169 --> 06:38:22,330
Bye.

2788
06:38:22,330 --> 06:38:23,290
Thank you again.

2789
06:38:23,290 --> 06:38:29,279
Feels bad ignoring Link.

2790
06:38:29,279 --> 06:38:30,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2791
06:38:30,159 --> 06:38:30,560
Which one?

2792
06:38:31,930 --> 06:38:32,889
Ah-ee-oo.

2793
06:38:33,689 --> 06:38:34,490
Ah-ee-oo.

2794
06:38:35,130 --> 06:38:37,419
Is this a huge ass?

2795
06:38:38,459 --> 06:38:39,740
Okay, this is funny.

2796
06:38:41,930 --> 06:38:43,290
All right, I'll allow this.

2797
06:38:43,290 --> 06:38:44,330
This is funny.

2798
06:38:44,330 --> 06:38:53,040
This one can slip through because I like it.

2799
06:38:53,040 --> 06:38:53,599
It's funny.

2800
06:38:54,159 --> 06:38:59,900
That's wrong.

2801
06:39:02,669 --> 06:39:04,840
Wrong Link is another one.

2802
06:39:06,680 --> 06:39:08,759
Press A for ah, E for e.

2803
06:39:12,189 --> 06:39:13,470
S for sneeze.

2804
06:39:18,270 --> 06:39:18,990
Audio jungle.

2805
06:39:21,950 --> 06:39:23,310
How did you make this website?

2806
06:39:32,750 --> 06:39:33,549
Nice rhyme.

2807
06:39:36,029 --> 06:39:37,950
I just did it, but I was just showing you that I have that too.

2808
06:39:38,669 --> 06:39:41,630
Hold them down?

2809
06:39:42,270 --> 06:39:43,659
Wait, wait, wait.

2810
06:39:43,659 --> 06:39:50,799
What do you mean hold them down?

2811
06:39:57,000 --> 06:39:57,560
No, that doesn't...

2812
06:39:57,560 --> 06:39:59,159
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2813
06:39:59,159 --> 06:40:00,040
Come on, come on, come on.

2814
06:40:00,040 --> 06:40:00,919
That's not fair.

2815
06:40:01,560 --> 06:40:02,200
That's not fair.

2816
06:40:05,310 --> 06:40:06,189
Okay, I'm not doing that again.

2817
06:40:06,189 --> 06:40:07,389
Audio jungle.

2818
06:40:07,389 --> 06:40:08,189
Yeah, done.

2819
06:40:08,189 --> 06:40:08,669
That was fun.

2820
06:40:09,400 --> 06:40:10,279
All right, good night.

2821
06:40:10,279 --> 06:40:12,200
I just blocked the rest of the credits with this shit.

2822
06:40:12,200 --> 06:40:12,759
Oh my god.

2823
06:40:12,759 --> 06:40:13,400
All right.

2824
06:40:13,400 --> 06:40:14,200
I'll see you guys Saturday.

2825
06:40:14,200 --> 06:40:15,240
Have a great night.

2826
06:40:15,240 --> 06:40:16,759
Go say hello to Italics.

2827
06:40:16,759 --> 06:40:19,470
Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

2828
06:40:19,470 --> 06:40:20,669
I will see you guys on Saturday.

2829
06:40:20,669 --> 06:40:21,229
Good night.

2830
06:40:21,229 --> 06:40:22,270
Good bye.

2831
06:40:22,270 --> 06:40:23,689
Take care of yourselves.

2832
06:40:26,159 --> 06:41:15,709
See you later.
