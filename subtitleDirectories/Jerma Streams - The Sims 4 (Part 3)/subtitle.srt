1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:08,900
Let me tell you something about Origin, okay? Here comes a five minute Origin Rage.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,500
Right? That guy right now just wrote that and was just like, I fucking knew it.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,519
And it was a joke. I'm good to go. How you guys doing?

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,550
And if it's your first time on the stream, my name is Jeremy. Your name is Dan.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,039
One of your name is Dan. Hope you're doing good.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,859
No, no Rage tonight. Not tonight. I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.

7
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:55,659
Not today. On the next VR stream, I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.

8
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,340
Am I drinking? I am not drinking. No. Not tonight.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,930
Not gonna drink tonight. No. Because I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.

10
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:21,370
So I'm not gonna drink a bunch of booze and then go to a doctor's appointment the next day.

11
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:35,620
So that means there's no stream tomorrow because that appointment is

12
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,739
right in the middle of the kind of evening afternoon.

13
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:55,590
Boomer health. Have I heard that Sims 4 has first person mode?

14
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,790
Yes, it is kind of the reason why I'm doing this stream.

15
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,530
I have a shitload of mods. If you remember, if you were here,

16
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:14,580
if you're part of the channel about a year ago, we did Sims 4 with a bunch of dog shit going on.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,629
What's with the- I don't know what the word dog shit is with me lately.

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,270
It's like the fourth or fifth time I've said it.

19
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,729
Oh, dog shit. You know, I got lots of dog shit.

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,819
I need to extend the vocabulary today.

21
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,409
Uh, that was in November, December, January, February, March, April.

22
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,930
All right, so it's been like four or five months.

23
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,099
No, it's been longer than that.

24
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,110
No, no, that's been- it's been longer than that.

25
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,030
I wasn't in Vegas during that stream.

26
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,229
Yeah, that was like j- that was like June of last year.

27
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,409
I was not in Vegas during the Sims 4 stream.

28
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,349
Oh yeah, no, that was a long time ago.

29
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,150
So it's been just about seven months.

30
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,389
Has it really been that long?

31
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,729
I can't believe- I like- thinking about it out loud is like,

32
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,250
oh yeah, it's been like just under a year.

33
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,770
It's been like seven months.

34
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,389
It's like, man, I feel like that was like two months ago.

35
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,909
And then again, I think about it, I've lived in Vegas now for almost five months.

36
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,189
It's like, didn't I just get here?

37
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,870
I just got here.

38
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:44,490
Strange.

39
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,409
But anyways, uh, a lot of you probably weren't here.

40
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,770
During those streams and what this stream is going to be is a continuation of that.

41
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:54,900
Mods.

42
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,460
Lots of them.

43
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,520
Sims killing each other.

44
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,199
Sims doing drugs.

45
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,159
Animals doing drugs.

46
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,460
I got a bunch more too.

47
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,659
There's at least two or three other mods you have not seen yet.

48
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,979
And first person, figured we would give it a try.

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
No sex mods.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm not doing that.

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,079
I cannot do that.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,870
Did you get more?

53
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,589
I did get more.

54
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,949
No, sex mods would get me actually in trouble with the platform.

55
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:38,149
Am I ever going to do a normal Sims game?

56
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,910
No, I can't after this.

57
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,100
After like watching Sims get chewed up by chainsaws, I can't go back and play the Sims.

58
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,720
We tried to do that.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,199
Do you remember?

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,839
And I'm going to put a rule on this stream too.

61
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,379
Because once you climb over that hill, you just start to fall down.

62
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,300
You hit the peak and you just start tumbling.

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
The first person that gets a knife in their back is the catalyst to the snowball.

64
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,709
So we got to be prepared for it.

65
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:20,120
Anyways, are you ready to make the new family?

66
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,069
Because we're not doing old family gone.

67
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,110
New family coming in.

68
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,060
The Elbertsons 2.

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,660
We need a better name than that.

70
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,740
Let's go ahead and turn this off here.

71
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,209
Yeah, I don't know how important any of this shit is.

72
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,750
There's a weird thing about The Sims 4, right?

73
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,810
Does this have the most DLC out of any video game ever made?

74
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,449
It really might.

75
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,720
I don't even have this.

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Get famous.

77
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,550
I don't have the get famous collection.

78
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,810
Look at all this though.

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,610
Game packs.

80
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:17,529
Stuff packs.

81
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,730
I don't even want any of it.

82
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,310
It doesn't have all the DLC.

83
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,790
It's just like 600 bucks for all this shit.

84
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,100
Each one of these is like $19.99.

85
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,779
You want me to spend 12 grand on The Sims 4?

86
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,850
Train Simulator has more DLC.

87
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,129
Yeah, it does.

88
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,129
EA Omega Lul.

89
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,629
I got BTTV.

90
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:57,750
Buy the vampire pack?

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,110
The vampire pack is not...

92
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,910
Okay, listen.

93
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,389
The Sims.

94
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,189
Strangerville.

95
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,310
Start your investigation and solve the mystery of a desert town that holds a dark, deep,

96
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,750
dark secret.

97
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,709
Guys, chainsaws can go through people's heads in our mod we have right now.

98
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,379
Do you really give a shit about this?

99
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,879
The Sims.

100
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,000
Jungle adventure.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,720
Take your Sims on a mysterious adventure into the wild.

102
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Discover new things, new cultures.

103
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,990
A guy can do acid and like pee on his floor.

104
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,899
This is all small potatoes to what we're doing here.

105
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,259
New family time.

106
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:50,540
Are you ready?

107
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,139
I'm not gonna buy the DLC.

108
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,310
All right, so you're probably looking at...

109
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,550
You've got...

110
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,970
Look, you see resume playing Bill.

111
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,370
That's because I had to make sure the mods worked.

112
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,129
So I had to just make a person.

113
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't worry, we're gonna revict them.

114
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,250
You didn't see that, okay?

115
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,370
You didn't see that.

116
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:21,019
I just needed to make sure that they worked.

117
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,420
All right.

118
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,639
I don't want to live here, by the way.

119
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:25,879
We...

120
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,000
What did we do last time?

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,700
I want to try a different place because we got Willow Creek, Oasis Springs.

122
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,820
Anyone remember where we lived?

123
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:40,419
I think we lived like in Newcrest or something.

124
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,559
Going to the city?

125
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,419
Newcrest?

126
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,240
I think we did...

127
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh yeah, we did the desert last time.

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,279
Let's do Newcrest.

129
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,659
Newcrest.

130
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,860
Or the Night City, this one.

131
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,259
Boring.

132
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:04,820
Boring.

133
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,429
This one.

134
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,429
Yeah, but is it always nighttime here?

135
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,889
I don't like that.

136
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,730
You want it to be always nighttime?

137
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,789
Look, it's fucking always nighttime.

138
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,340
Oh cool, there's like a gym here?

139
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,620
Planet Honey Pop.

140
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,059
Karaoke bar.

141
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,340
Okay.

142
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,019
Uh, what the...

143
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:45,580
That's...

144
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,460
Why the...

145
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,659
Okay, I'm freaking out right now.

146
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,220
All right, anyways.

147
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,059
Where the hell am I supposed to live?

148
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,879
You want me to live in like one of these fucking apartments?

149
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:57,750
I have...

150
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,110
I'm gonna have a huge family.

151
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,830
There's gonna be a bunch of like dogs, cats, aliens.

152
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,220
You want me to live in one of these like New York City high rises?

153
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,870
Superior Cream just came in 50 bucks from Superior Cream.

154
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,139
Thank you so much, Superior Cream.

155
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,659
Five zero.

156
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,139
Fifty.

157
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:22,039
And...

158
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,289
They say, I'm Michael, it's my birthday today.

159
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,570
Cake and ice cream is on its way.

160
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,990
Thought I'd share some birthday cheer for all the best content.

161
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,710
Thank you so much.

162
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,049
Happy birthday.

163
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,129
You shouldn't be giving me money on your birthday.

164
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:40,059
But thanks a lot.

165
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,500
Means a fucking shitload.

166
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,220
Hope you have a fantastic birthday.

167
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,820
Thanks for joining us for your birthday.

168
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,460
Where are we going?

169
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,500
Uh, map.

170
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,980
Can I live in the art studio?

171
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,100
Studio apartments?

172
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,500
House apartments?

173
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,059
What about this one?

174
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:10,629
No, I don't want to live in the city.

175
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,429
Art family.

176
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,019
Not fine.

177
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,500
All right.

178
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,379
This is going to be the ship family.

179
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,340
Let us click.

180
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,139
Okay, all right, fine.

181
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,409
Fine, you guys get to pick where I live.

182
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,580
I have to be able to afford it though.

183
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,940
No, I don't have any money.

184
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,299
Are these places expensive?

185
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,740
They are.

186
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,120
I think these places are actually really expensive.

187
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Just cheat and add money.

188
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,490
I could do that.

189
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,009
It's Control Shift C, right?

190
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,929
I need to use it for one of the mods I have anyways.

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,679
All right, here you go.

192
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,490
Where am I living?

193
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,059
Wow, very divided.

194
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,879
Exceptionally divided it seems.

195
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,659
I can't live in the park.

196
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,559
I can't live here.

197
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,679
I don't know why you're clicking it.

198
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,019
Can I live in here?

199
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,139
This is the one it seems.

200
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,340
Okay, all two apartments.

201
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,000
No way to do it.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
All right, all right, hold on, hold on.

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,279
Wait, let's do this actually democratically.

204
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,600
Hold on.

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,600
You ready?

206
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,590
Go for it.

207
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,429
I want the true democratic experience.

208
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,080
That doesn't matter.

209
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:24,470
Everybody wants me to live in the night town.

210
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,539
I'm not buying this.

211
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm not going to buy these.

212
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,659
No, no, I refuse 100%.

213
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,419
I'm going here.

214
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:34,899
Ready?

215
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:35,860
Now pick the place.

216
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,730
Three, two, one, go for it.

217
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,730
This is the only choice that you guys are going to get the whole stream.

218
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,929
So make it count.

219
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,809
I got to cheat and give myself money.

220
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,169
I don't know if the cheat is to do that though.

221
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,230
Why does everybody want me to live here?

222
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:08,470
Mother load, okay.

223
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:19,179
Did I do it?

224
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,179
Did that work?

225
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:30,419
I have to have a family first, okay.

226
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,620
All right, so this is where we're going.

227
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,779
We're going to go to this auto apartments.

228
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,820
Thank you for voting.

229
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,080
Let's go make the family.

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,629
Welcome to the next, probably at least hour of the spring.

231
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,710
And everyone that has, there you go.

232
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,509
You're about to see why.

233
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,269
Kind of don't want to change anything.

234
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,539
For like three hours.

235
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:12,149
Okay, I got to get the cheat thing off.

236
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,580
Forehead.

237
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:28,309
It made it perfect.

238
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:33,830
I don't know what I even want to do here.

239
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,230
All right, first of all, let's get out of this.

240
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,519
Let's do some detail work on the head.

241
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,419
Always start on the head.

242
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,740
It looks like daisy duck.

243
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,659
Well, let's go ahead and make daisy duck.

244
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,860
Daisy duck?

245
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,419
Like Donald Duck's girlfriend?

246
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,740
Donald Duck's like fiance?

247
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,379
That's, is that who daisy duck is?

248
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:10,870
How does this look like daisy duck?

249
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:18,419
All right, let's keep this, let's go.

250
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,940
So let's get, I want to do some detail here.

251
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,470
Bring the lips down.

252
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:35,509
Okay, let's go with a bit more fat on the outside.

253
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,980
Forehead being down looks fine.

254
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,429
Now bring this in.

255
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,330
Should we see the eyes?

256
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,289
I don't think so.

257
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:01,659
All right, now all the way down.

258
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:12,009
A little, maybe a little bit skinnier.

259
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,769
I liked it the way it was.

260
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:35,880
No, no, no, we can't make like another chuck schnozwell.

261
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,519
That's good.

262
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:41,130
Like that.

263
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,920
Put the nose right at the top of the mouth.

264
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,700
Now that actually looks like a duck.

265
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,599
Why don't just make the duck, right?

266
00:17:52,599 --> 00:18:03,589
That works, right?

267
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,190
All right, let's back it up a little bit.

268
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,869
That actually scared the shit out of me.

269
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,589
I jumped a little bit backwards.

270
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:14,619
I want to grab the cheat.

271
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,740
I got to get rid of the hair.

272
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,579
Oops.

273
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:24,460
No, no, the head's way too big.

274
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,099
There we go.

275
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,619
Harry, Harry, you got to go.

276
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:38,470
Let's get something different here.

277
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,190
I like this one.

278
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:54,789
Not bad.

279
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,430
I don't hate it.

280
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,789
No, I don't want the nose.

281
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,710
The nose doesn't do it for me right now.

282
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:17,130
No, pull it back.

283
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,930
Uh-oh.

284
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,109
I think I've ruined it forever.

285
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:23,589
There we go.

286
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:28,839
Okay.

287
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,799
Yeah, I prefer...

288
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,000
The nose makes it just too weird.

289
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:45,529
That looks better.

290
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,759
Okay.

291
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,650
The hair, though, needs to be changed.

292
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,490
I don't hate this.

293
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,369
That looks fine.

294
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:02,299
Hold on, wait.

295
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,859
What about just like the Marge Simpson?

296
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,670
It's not the Marge Simpson, but...

297
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,380
The forehead needs to be bigger.

298
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,619
I'm not sure I can even make the forehead bigger.

299
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,190
Oh, shit.

300
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:28,730
Fixed.

301
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:38,410
Don't worry, fixed.

302
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,890
No, that's...

303
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,329
I can't make the forehead any bigger.

304
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,119
That's what you got.

305
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,519
Ooh, he's a head shape.

306
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,319
No, no, no.

307
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,910
We'll keep that hair.

308
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,789
No accessories.

309
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:54,329
Oh, it's makeup.

310
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:54,890
Okay.

311
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,450
No hats.

312
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,269
Makeup.

313
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:03,910
Should we just have big eyes up here?

314
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,470
Can I do that?

315
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,430
Can I paint that myself?

316
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:13,220
Holy shit.

317
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,019
That's terrifying.

318
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:24,059
Is there a way I can do this myself?

319
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,799
Eyes, cheeks, face paint.

320
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,200
There's no way.

321
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,079
Can I not just do it?

322
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,200
I made Dory from Finding Nemo.

323
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Okay, let's mess around here.

324
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,170
The wrench at the bottom.

325
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,890
At the bottom, like here.

326
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,720
What the fuck is that?

327
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,400
I don't know what that is.

328
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
I don't know what that is.

329
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,819
That just burst out.

330
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:14,150
Holy shit.

331
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,349
Why is that under face paint?

332
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:25,000
All right, whatever.

333
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,960
That's fine.

334
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,480
Now, let's go back to here.

335
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,450
Change some stuff around here.

336
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,339
Should we just give her a little like goat feet?

337
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:48,920
That looks fine.

338
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,460
Let's bring those shoulders in.

339
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,210
Extend the arms out a little bit.

340
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:09,130
Need to have like...

341
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,589
All right, what about...

342
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,470
Oh Christ.

343
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:21,160
Okay, hold on.

344
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,359
Big like thick neck.

345
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:26,539
The pear.

346
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,059
All right, we made the pear.

347
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:40,869
Okay, and then let's have...

348
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:49,880
That's all right.

349
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,400
No, it needs to be the color.

350
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,440
I got to get the right color here.

351
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,069
Is it just a onesie that you can put on?

352
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:03,140
No, no, that's not going to work.

353
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,180
Can I just put her in a big pear colored onesie?

354
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,059
I don't know if that is it.

355
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:10,779
I'm afraid to plug it.

356
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,799
I don't know what this is.

357
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,380
I'm terrified.

358
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,839
Oh, it just makes them invisible.

359
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,180
But what would that be for?

360
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,099
Just a floating person?

361
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,859
A ghost lady?

362
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,490
I don't know.

363
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,130
What is this?

364
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,720
Oh, just a dress.

365
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:40,630
That's not bad.

366
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,910
That's kind of a pretty good pear.

367
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,720
I like this one.

368
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:53,930
There we go.

369
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:58,490
Yeah, like Pauline Pear.

370
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:02,250
We need a last name here.

371
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:10,869
The pear family?

372
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,619
No, this is not going to be the pear family.

373
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:19,819
That means every single person has to have their last name be pear.

374
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:24,089
Do you want me to make a series of fruits?

375
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,210
The fruit family?

376
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,450
You just want them to be all like bananas, apples, and oranges and shit?

377
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,000
Is this worth three hours?

378
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:57,059
Can I make...

379
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:04,200
Okay, is there...

380
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,559
All right, so this we got...

381
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,079
Is this a green apple?

382
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,589
Is this blueberry?

383
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,220
Oh, can I do a custom color?

384
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:26,039
I hate this.

385
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,970
I don't want to continue doing this.

386
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,410
Because we're going to have like an apple.

387
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,450
We're going to have a blueberry.

388
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,210
We're going to have a banana.

389
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,289
Is there like...

390
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,960
All right, fine.

391
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,220
This lipstick's got to go though.

392
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,299
Okay, we have to have more than one family.

393
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,579
You guys understand that, right?

394
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:53,180
Because this is going to be a drug dealer.

395
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,700
This is going to be animals.

396
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,619
We're going all out tonight.

397
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,980
Make a vegetable family?

398
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,269
No.

399
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,109
Make the whole city food.

400
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,069
How am I going to do that?

401
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,940
It's just fruits, vegetables, meats, and cheeses?

402
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,180
Take the food land?

403
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,019
No, that's going to take me like all day.

404
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,720
I actually kind of like the idea of the food group family.

405
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,599
Where it's like a...

406
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,640
Well, we already had bread.

407
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:44,710
Fats, oils, meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits.

408
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,230
Let's see how far I can take this.

409
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,579
And then I'm going to move on.

410
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,940
Welcome to the rest of the streams.

411
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm serious.

412
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,690
All right, we need like a different color.

413
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,339
Here we go.

414
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:03,720
It looks better.

415
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,819
All right, there's Pauline pear fruit.

416
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:09,779
Make a hamburger.

417
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,829
All right, personality traits.

418
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,309
Let's see.

419
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,859
Food, master chef.

420
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:21,980
They all have to be chefs.

421
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,089
Hot-headed, self-assured, goofball, creative, active.

422
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,059
Because it's a pear.

423
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:33,980
Let's see here.

424
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:42,490
We got art lover, foodie, ambitious, clumsy.

425
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,690
This is all about what a pear would be.

426
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:50,740
Childish maybe?

427
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:50,980
No.

428
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,059
Probably pretty neat.

429
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,740
Vegetarian, snob.

430
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,140
Hold on.

431
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,099
Let's look at the other categories.

432
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:04,950
Broke, lover, mean, noncommittal, loner.

433
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:10,630
Vegetarian.

434
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:16,490
That's pretty terrible considering.

435
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:21,190
Just...

436
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:22,680
Okay.

437
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,099
That's actually kind of scary.

438
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:25,819
All right, we're good.

439
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:26,460
Pauline pear.

440
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,910
It's the fruit family coming up next.

441
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,349
We have...

442
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,140
All right, is it going to be berry, blueberry?

443
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,460
Berry banana?

444
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,950
All right, that looks good.

445
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,710
Default walk style.

446
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:54,869
Berry banana.

447
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm not going to make the annoying orange.

448
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,240
Banana would be pretty confident.

449
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,400
Roommates with Pauline pear.

450
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,250
Sweet.

451
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:19,769
Okay, that's good.

452
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,769
Benedict banana.

453
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,150
Benedict.

454
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,430
Banana.

455
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:26,869
I can't fit it.

456
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,809
How about Ben banana?

457
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:36,519
Ben banana fruit.

458
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,630
Last name.

459
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:40,390
Oh, that's right.

460
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,509
Ben banana.

461
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,450
But don't...

462
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,809
Oh no, they can be roommates.

463
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:47,849
It's not The Sims 2.

464
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,369
Benedict.

465
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:51,900
Benedict banana.

466
00:30:52,539 --> 00:31:00,309
I didn't spell that right.

467
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:01,349
Ben-edict.

468
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,559
Make Benedict cucumber?

469
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,559
And make it a cucumber.

470
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:09,799
What?

471
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,789
No, just have it be Dr. Strange.

472
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,130
Benedict cucumber patch.

473
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,450
Just make him green.

474
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,130
No, no, no, no, no.

475
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,009
All right, we got to focus.

476
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:34,970
Focus on the banana.

477
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,769
Benedict banana.

478
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,869
Fuck this already.

479
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,329
How am I going to do this?

480
00:31:49,130 --> 00:32:03,349
How am I going to make Benedict banana?

481
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,160
Is it looking costumes?

482
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,920
Is there actually like a banana costume?

483
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,109
Let's see.

484
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:15,799
Suit jackets, business swimsuit, vests, full body.

485
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,859
Costumes.

486
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:21,049
Banana.

487
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,589
First person to die, by the way.

488
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:58,740
No, this should be the drug dealer.

489
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,220
No, all right.

490
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,059
Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.

491
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,640
Take this costume off.

492
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,779
No banana though, unfortunately.

493
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:20,579
But there is a hot dog.

494
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:21,700
But what if I make the hot dog?

495
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,220
Can I color the hot dog?

496
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:31,220
Can we just pretend this is a banana?

497
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,140
I can't make this a different color.

498
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,259
It's a banana.

499
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:38,579
Yes.

500
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,619
Okay, guys, this is a peeled banana in a bun.

501
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:54,069
With mustard on it.

502
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,990
No, that's just, that's banana puree.

503
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:02,500
Okay, can I do anything else with that?

504
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:13,050
Okay, let's see if I can make this work for all of us.

505
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:21,739
Let's go in closer here.

506
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:37,179
Bring it out.

507
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,460
Bring the face in.

508
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:53,829
Okay, really, it's hard to do this with the...

509
00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:14,010
I need to get in there.

510
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,699
It's hard to get in there though,

511
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,500
because its head is so in such a strange place.

512
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:27,159
I wish I could move the camera more with a detailed edit,

513
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,360
because see how it's too big?

514
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:43,110
Pull that in.

515
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,579
Angel fish.

516
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,460
There we go.

517
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,500
It's a good start.

518
00:35:50,500 --> 00:36:07,179
Pull these ears back.

519
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:10,170
I really need to get a hold of here.

520
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,139
I can't.

521
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:24,900
I can make his head temporarily smaller.

522
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,460
Damn it.

523
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,230
You really don't want to let me grab that, do you?

524
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:45,769
Okay, I need to bring these out further.

525
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,420
Oh, shit.

526
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,380
There we go.

527
00:36:48,380 --> 00:37:07,260
I need the back of his head.

528
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,699
Come on, give me the back of the head.

529
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:14,230
We got to kill all the eyebrows and shit.

530
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,429
No facial hair.

531
00:37:15,429 --> 00:37:17,590
Get rid of the eyebrows too.

532
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:27,929
It's Lex Luthor.

533
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:39,960
Not quite.

534
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,480
I need this to come up.

535
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,260
I need to get under here and like pull that up.

536
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,940
It's too long.

537
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,219
See, I can't even grab it.

538
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,909
Jesus Christ, this is horrifying.

539
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:19,530
Okay, I need to get these eyebrows out of here.

540
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:35,380
Okay, hair.

541
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,500
Facial hair.

542
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,860
Accessories, eyebrows.

543
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,139
Delete eyebrows.

544
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:52,550
Okay, there we go.

545
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,670
I can't get rid of them.

546
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,079
Yeah, yeah, I can.

547
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:05,369
Oh, this sucks.

548
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,329
This sucks.

549
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:09,449
Absolute ass.

550
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,250
Put them back?

551
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,090
No, I'm not going to put them back.

552
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,849
I need this skull to come up.

553
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:23,130
All right, let's widen it a little more.

554
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,500
He's ripping through the costume with his banana face.

555
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:34,840
Let's see if I can pull this middle back one more time.

556
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,639
Okay, I can.

557
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:44,389
There we go.

558
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:53,219
That's good.

559
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,929
I'm looking.

560
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,610
I need that on this side.

561
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,070
How do I get that little tilt there?

562
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:11,739
Come on, give me that tilt right here.

563
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:17,139
Let me see his mouth.

564
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:25,960
No, that's too fucked up.

565
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,519
We can't go totally fucked up.

566
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,820
He has to at least kind of look like a person.

567
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,559
That's pretty banana-like.

568
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,360
It is.

569
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,920
All right, all right.

570
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,519
Now we need a hat.

571
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:46,380
The nose is a little too extreme.

572
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:47,820
I agree.

573
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:56,519
Now we just need a pointy hat.

574
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,539
Let's see.

575
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:03,340
Let's see if we can get it.

576
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,300
Any like goofy funny hats?

577
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,659
Kind of, but I can't.

578
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:16,440
No, that doesn't work.

579
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,480
That doesn't work.

580
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,449
This is not even going to fit on his face.

581
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,090
Yes, it does.

582
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,860
Yeah, why can't you have Darth Vader?

583
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,960
Please be yellow.

584
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, come on.

585
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,940
That is as good as it's going to get.

586
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,780
That is a banana in a bun with some hot dogs.

587
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,840
That was perfect.

588
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,940
Even more like a hot dog.

589
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:03,800
It's not a hot dog.

590
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,519
It's a banana.

591
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,500
It's a peeled banana.

592
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,179
You got to go with what you can work with here.

593
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,920
I can't make a banana.

594
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,460
It's not a tofu dog.

595
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,059
It's a banana.

596
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:19,860
Hold on.

597
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:29,019
Can I give him a jacket or something so I can cover this up?

598
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,219
No, no, no.

599
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:30,940
It has to be this.

600
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:32,250
Tops.

601
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,449
Can I throw something else on top?

602
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,119
No.

603
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,269
God damn it.

604
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:39,769
Shit.

605
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,739
Yellow tux.

606
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:49,780
No, but it doesn't work.

607
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:54,809
I can't do a yellow tux.

608
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,820
Okay, it kind of does work.

609
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,460
Wait, wait, wait.

610
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,340
It looks like a mustard dispenser.

611
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,000
Hold on.

612
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,650
He's just like a regular guy in a suit but just happens to also be a banana.

613
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:28,940
That's not bad.

614
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:40,980
Just do a filter for yellow.

615
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:45,659
Let's get, oh, let me get, let me get out a full body.

616
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:58,010
I actually kind of liked, oh, look at this one.

617
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:09,929
I like the idea of he's just a regular guy but really, really, really took on that banana persona

618
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:16,360
and is just killing it.

619
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,440
Plus, make sure we pick stuff that they're wearing that it's easy enough for me to replicate

620
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,079
when these assholes inevitably end up in the next rumble.

621
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,869
Hold on.

622
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:34,679
I said that's too yellow.

623
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,400
That is mustard.

624
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,440
This is banana.

625
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:44,360
Let's see, what do we get for bottoms?

626
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,539
Oh no, you're right.

627
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,750
You're right.

628
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:58,869
We got to make some very, very minor changes here because this is just like dickhead man.

629
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,329
This is just penis guy.

630
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,369
This is not even a banana.

631
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:08,489
Okay, I got to fix this.

632
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,280
A banana just is a dick.

633
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:17,380
If you think about it, how do I fix this?

634
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,110
I'm talking like I'm going to create a character.

635
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:33,500
I'm making a peeled banana and it's this, a peeled banana is this kind of like fleshy color.

636
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,099
Just make it yellow.

637
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:49,659
I can't.

638
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:59,239
All right, he's just, he's just going in a regular, he's going in regular clothes.

639
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,440
Take off the hot dog head.

640
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,969
That makes it so much better because that is, he is a banana.

641
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,420
He's just a guy with a big chin here.

642
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:19,079
No, that has to stay.

643
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:19,800
All right, let's go.

644
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:22,579
Time to complete this guy.

645
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,300
I'm going to put him in, what was that suit I had before?

646
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:38,780
No, no.

647
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,940
He's unfriendly and scary.

648
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,659
How do you know that?

649
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:52,329
Just make him a real person.

650
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:56,139
What is that?

651
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,340
What?

652
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:07,719
Oh, there it is.

653
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,590
Why did his chin get smaller?

654
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,210
Excuse me.

655
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,980
What happened to his, what happened to him?

656
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:34,389
He lost all of his charm, his eyes.

657
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:42,760
That's okay.

658
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,000
That's actually pretty good because it's not as extreme.

659
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,719
I don't hate this.

660
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,829
The outfit fucked it up.

661
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:04,099
All right, looks good.

662
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:05,300
This is Benedict Banana.

663
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:18,199
Gonna change the bottom here.

664
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:19,239
No, he's not gonna be jacked.

665
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,860
He's gonna be skinny.

666
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,699
Hot dog hat and the yellow raincoat.

667
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,539
Should I just take the hot dog hat off?

668
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,659
Is it technically still on?

669
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:32,949
Yeah, it's technically still on.

670
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,820
Nah, it doesn't change anything.

671
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,940
It's perfect.

672
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,219
It's perfect.

673
00:48:52,219 --> 00:49:12,699
All right, we need to 100% perfect.

674
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,659
That's the banana.

675
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,139
Peel.

676
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:15,099
He's peeled back.

677
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:23,369
All right, let's see what I'm gonna do for pants here.

678
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:24,889
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

679
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,449
What?

680
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:34,119
Oh, because this is full body.

681
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,639
We can't change the pants.

682
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:38,360
Oh, what the fuck?

683
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,239
What happened to that?

684
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:43,539
That's kind of dumb.

685
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:52,599
Well, that's the way it's gonna be.

686
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,219
There's Benedict Banana for you.

687
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,059
And this is every day.

688
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:01,820
Yellow rain.

689
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,980
Dude, the shoes, the yellow rain boots.

690
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,510
I don't even know if they have that shit.

691
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,230
Boots here.

692
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:24,889
So what's going on here then?

693
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:30,780
All right, that looks good.

694
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,460
Benedict Banana.

695
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,380
Banana's a potassium, right?

696
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:47,480
Chef.

697
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:47,960
Genius.

698
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,719
It's a brain power food.

699
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,260
No, it helped.

700
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,219
It's got plenty of vitamins in it.

701
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:55,699
Cheerful.

702
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,590
I would say childish as well.

703
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,949
Lots of kids eat bananas.

704
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,860
It's in every lunchbox in America.

705
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,260
Clumsy.

706
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,460
Why would a banana be clumsy?

707
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,500
Clumsy.

708
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:22,519
How would a banana be clumsy?

709
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:25,670
All right, got Benedict Banana.

710
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,789
I gotta change.

711
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:27,590
Okay, so you're done.

712
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:32,619
I gotta change your name to Pauline Pear

713
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:36,139
and not have it be the Pauline Pear.

714
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:40,420
Oh, it's because it was a banana.

715
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:40,900
I get it.

716
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:44,380
Pauline Pear.

717
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,099
All right, we're gonna make...

718
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,420
Let's make Apple Andy.

719
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:54,699
How's that sound?

720
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,289
Apple Andy.

721
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:08,760
All right, let's see.

722
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,800
How am I gonna do Apple?

723
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,219
Adam Apple.

724
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:17,820
And just have him have a huge neck,

725
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,460
like a big fucking bump on the front of his neck.

726
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,710
Let me see if I can do that first

727
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,989
and then we'll go from there.

728
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:27,849
I don't think I can do that.

729
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:34,889
All right, we need to get the first things first.

730
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:46,869
You should add a baby

731
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,630
so you can have like a baby carrot.

732
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,739
No, no, I'm not going to add a baby

733
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,539
considering the in-fucking-sane mods

734
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:55,260
that are in this game.

735
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:58,840
That's not gonna happen.

736
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,280
That would be the worst mistake

737
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,159
I probably could ever make.

738
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,400
I'm telling you right now,

739
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,880
trust me when I say no baby.

740
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:16,420
No, no, no, no.

741
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,920
Boo.

742
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,630
All right, we gotta have a huge head.

743
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:25,030
There's an apple.

744
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,949
That might be too big.

745
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:30,119
All right, get rid of the hair.

746
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:36,619
Let's go with no eyebrows.

747
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:37,659
None of them should have eyebrows.

748
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:38,460
Fuck the eyebrows.

749
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:39,820
They're fruits.

750
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,280
All right, what does an apple look like?

751
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,179
It's square, right?

752
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:52,119
I mean, it's...

753
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,940
First of all, no, I'm fucking kidding.

754
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,420
Do you even have a face?

755
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,340
No, how big should the nose be?

756
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,480
Nothing extreme because that's just like dumb.

757
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:20,699
I can go absurd with this shit.

758
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:33,510
What is like the...

759
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,389
Hold on, where did I get the...

760
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:40,889
I know I can tilt.

761
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,619
Where's the thing to pull it down?

762
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,699
I just want to show you this

763
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,940
because it's fucking crazy.

764
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,349
If I can get it to catch on it,

765
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:07,460
you'll see just how stupid this is.

766
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,539
That's nothing.

767
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:19,619
If I can get the camera in the right place,

768
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,110
you can actually do some stupid shit.

769
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,210
Somebody has to be a dinosaur.

770
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,280
Damn it, come on.

771
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,300
It's just so hard to grab.

772
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:48,760
Is there a way that I can make it do like tilt or stretch?

773
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,159
Or do I have to have it be in the exact spot?

774
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,960
Is there a certain combination of buttons I can do?

775
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:05,159
Hold shift, detail edit,

776
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:07,639
because yes, I'm trying to get the little tilt thing

777
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:16,570
because I can pull this all the way down to the ground if I want.

778
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,059
I'm certain of it.

779
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,619
I got to get like the combination to do it.

780
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:32,739
So it's crazy.

781
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,480
Make the nose small first.

782
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,610
All right, there, not that one.

783
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:45,050
All right, right here.

784
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:46,760
That's what I'm looking for.

785
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,559
I want that on the nose.

786
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:57,860
Come on, let me see it.

787
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:02,280
I'm just, I'm just making Michael Cera.

788
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,800
Come on, do it.

789
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:15,449
Just do it.

790
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,150
No.

791
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,889
Oh, whatever.

792
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:46,679
Make it normal.

793
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:53,610
This is supposed to be an apple, right?

794
00:57:54,170 --> 00:58:02,409
Yeah, pull the bridge out.

795
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:03,449
It's too deep.

796
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:19,400
It needs to be way fatter than this.

797
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,800
That's not a bad head shape.

798
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,320
When I said square, what I'm talking about is,

799
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,289
you know how an apple has sort of the beefy buff chest

800
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:36,570
and then comes down a little bit?

801
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:54,070
Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.

802
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,900
It's fine.

803
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,820
Any bigger than that.

804
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,019
That looks good.

805
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:10,489
Okay, look, maybe the head a little bit bigger.

806
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:12,699
Look at that.

807
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,440
Perfect apple.

808
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,000
It just is.

809
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:18,179
I want to make the head wider, but I don't think I can.

810
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:18,659
That's all right.

811
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,139
It looks good.

812
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,980
Oh, Jojo, right?

813
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,860
The Jojo song.

814
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,300
I don't know why I just did that.

815
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:35,190
That's all I could just hear right there.

816
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,760
That like, I don't even know what it is.

817
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,420
What does it say?

818
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:55,559
It goes like, the torture dance, right?

819
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,610
That don't ask me why the fuck I just did that,

820
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,570
but hey, there it is.

821
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:06,329
Vocal percussion on a whole nother level.

822
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:06,730
There it is.

823
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:08,730
For those of you that are watching,

824
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,690
I've never seen that show.

825
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,309
I don't know what it is.

826
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:22,820
And we want like a big happy family for the apple.

827
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,679
Love?

828
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:31,880
Nature?

829
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:37,289
No.

830
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:38,489
Apples want like a big huge...

831
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:39,530
Look, that's an apple tree.

832
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:41,420
Very, very clear.

833
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,849
Self-assured.

834
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:48,809
They're kind of assholes.

835
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,170
They think they're the best fruit in the bunch.

836
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,800
No, he's not done.

837
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,079
I just want to get this out of the way first.

838
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:08,920
Love the halfway half of this.

839
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,130
Oh, we didn't get to see it.

840
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,429
That's sicko.

841
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:17,429
You're fucked up.

842
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:20,170
Okay.

843
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:22,739
How does this sound?

844
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,280
That's perfect for me.

845
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,079
All right, we're gonna add hair.

846
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:49,219
I mean, just stem.

847
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,320
That's not gonna work.

848
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,039
That's way too frayed out to be a stem.

849
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:00,099
Is there a single ponytail I can put up?

850
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,530
What about the bun?

851
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:07,500
That's pretty close.

852
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,059
So is that.

853
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:12,920
Oh, God.

854
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,510
But that could be a tomato.

855
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,429
That's not even a fucking apple.

856
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:23,349
It doesn't need to be brown.

857
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:27,670
What about this one?

858
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,110
This one's a little smaller.

859
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:35,380
I think that's as close as it's gonna be.

860
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:43,260
All right, what about clothes?

861
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,340
Tomato is a fruit.

862
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:51,619
Should he just have no clothes on at all?

863
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:53,139
I feel like an apple wouldn't have any clothes on.

864
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:57,849
Apple's very basic.

865
01:02:58,409 --> 01:02:59,369
Doesn't need anything.

866
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:09,579
You don't add stuff to apples.

867
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:10,780
You just eat it.

868
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,099
At least make the underwear red.

869
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:14,059
Yeah, I'll try.

870
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:18,489
What do you got right now?

871
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:19,530
Can I make it red?

872
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,409
I can.

873
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:23,699
All right, there's Apple Andy.

874
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,550
Actually, it should be Andy Apple.

875
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:29,260
Last name is gonna be the fruit.

876
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,690
Change this into a formal outfit.

877
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,449
This is everyday.

878
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:41,949
Formal.

879
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,219
No, I'm keeping that.

880
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:47,539
I'm not taking this off.

881
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:55,909
Why would I take that off?

882
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,059
Who's next in this shit show?

883
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,039
We're gonna go with five.

884
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,570
What's left?

885
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:13,190
Apple, pear, banana, apple, blueberry.

886
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:24,019
Do we already have a berry?

887
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:25,059
Is it berry banana?

888
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:27,159
No, it's Benedict banana.

889
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:32,489
Okay, okay.

890
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,030
The candy one that sounds better.

891
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:45,320
Wait, wouldn't blueberry...

892
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,679
No, blueberry would have a tiny head.

893
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:47,960
Not a big one.

894
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:52,070
Wouldn't a blueberry be little...

895
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:58,519
Did you just say blueberry Andy?

896
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:02,570
Why would I make this guy's name blueberry Andy?

897
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,230
I do that.

898
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:16,730
Okay, let's detail this up.

899
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,420
I think the chin, everything has to come up.

900
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:21,820
Everything.

901
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,349
Small, condensed.

902
01:05:25,909 --> 01:05:40,570
I'm losing his neck here.

903
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:47,619
Let's make you...

904
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:49,260
What?

905
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,699
No, no, no, no, no.

906
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:55,590
Yeah, yeah.

907
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,869
Smaller head or right.

908
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,550
I can't make it that much smaller.

909
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,139
That's as small as I can make it.

910
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:09,750
Without distorting.

911
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,309
I mean, why is it that long?

912
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,400
Okay, that looks not bad at all actually.

913
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,949
Let me just go in here.

914
01:06:24,949 --> 01:07:10,659
Do the eyebrows.

915
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:16,230
Should the blueberry just have eyebrows?

916
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:25,989
Why would that happen?

917
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:42,969
I don't know why the blueberry has big ears.

918
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:43,690
Nice.

919
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:44,489
Looking good.

920
01:07:44,489 --> 01:08:05,099
Hold on.

921
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:06,139
I gotta fix that.

922
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:25,420
Eyes gotta be a little smaller.

923
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:34,500
They're taking up too much space.

924
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,699
Holy fuck.

925
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,520
He looks like he's in pain.

926
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:50,819
I gotta bring this in.

927
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:52,140
In.

928
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,020
Come in.

929
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:59,449
You look like a guy wearing a slipknot mask.

930
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:35,109
Okay, I want to bring this up and pull this back.

931
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:40,090
Oh no, I think I broke it.

932
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,649
No, I didn't.

933
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:41,050
We're good.

934
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:59,340
This is Gonzo from The Muppets is who this is turning into.

935
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,460
All right, back to normal.

936
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:06,250
I think my hands are up right now.

937
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:19,300
How big?

938
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,640
I need to make you a little bit smaller.

939
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:27,319
Okay, let's go.

940
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,140
No, this is fine.

941
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,420
Berry blueberry is done.

942
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:37,979
This is just a house of the gushers fruit people.

943
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,390
Yeah, it kind of is.

944
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:45,020
All right, Berry.

945
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,220
No, he needs clothes.

946
01:10:46,220 --> 01:11:04,939
Everyone just can't be naked.

947
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:05,739
Make him short?

948
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:08,439
I can't.

949
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:12,069
I can't without making him a child.

950
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:14,710
I can't do it and I can't have a child in this game.

951
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:28,550
This is guys, this is gonna be like a fucking long ass stream.

952
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,189
Okay.

953
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:38,359
All right, here we go.

954
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,239
Smaller, small.

955
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:39,880
I can't.

956
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,199
I can't do it.

957
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,239
It's gonna fuck it all up.

958
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:44,279
If I go down to...

959
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:48,020
No, his whole head is...

960
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,060
Everything's gonna be fucked up.

961
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,739
All of his head is gonna be misshaped.

962
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,420
I'm gonna have to do it all over again.

963
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:56,279
No, do you see how long this took?

964
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,159
I'm not making Berry blueberry again.

965
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:09,109
The undo button with control Z.

966
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:10,869
If this fucks it up, I'm gonna scream.

967
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:25,850
Okay, it works.

968
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,899
Do you understand?

969
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:29,260
Teen didn't do anything.

970
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,779
See?

971
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,979
Young adult didn't do anything.

972
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,890
You have to make them a child.

973
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:39,050
No, no, no.

974
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:39,609
How far?

975
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:40,569
Thank God.

976
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:44,760
Do you understand why this cannot be in the game?

977
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,789
Nope, I'm sorry.

978
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:57,270
I gotta stand on my moral soapbox here.

979
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,279
Old man.

980
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:15,260
No, I'm gonna keep the way it was.

981
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,300
You have to make a prune.

982
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,899
All right, let's get through.

983
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:18,939
We got Berry blueberry.

984
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:20,939
Let's get the aspirations.

985
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:23,659
It's a brain food.

986
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:25,829
Nerd brain.

987
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:29,909
Blueberries are a little on the...

988
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:31,109
They're blue, right?

989
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:42,329
Childish.

990
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:43,789
Hmm.

991
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,779
Berry blueberry.

992
01:13:52,779 --> 01:13:53,180
There you go.

993
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:53,680
Okay.

994
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,359
Now we need another one.

995
01:13:57,579 --> 01:13:58,140
All right.

996
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,460
I'm kind of sick of the fruit theme at this point.

997
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,779
This is one house.

998
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:03,739
One apartment.

999
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:08,250
So we've got pear, apple...

1000
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:22,909
Pear, banana, apple, blueberry, grape, baby carrot, or riot.

1001
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:23,409
No.

1002
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:27,609
I ain't gonna have...

1003
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:28,729
I ain't gonna be the guy that...

1004
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:30,689
No.

1005
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:31,189
Uh-uh.

1006
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:35,439
Grandpa lemon?

1007
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,500
Let me see.

1008
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,619
Let me see what I can do here.

1009
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,359
We could do...

1010
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:45,760
What else is green?

1011
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,779
Like a lettuce?

1012
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,920
Larry lettuce?

1013
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,569
Is that gonna work?

1014
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,319
Lenny lettuce.

1015
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,710
Grandpa lime.

1016
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:08,119
Lemon, lemon, lemon.

1017
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:11,479
We don't have like a pure yellow, yellow, yellow.

1018
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,539
A kiwi?

1019
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:18,350
Yeah, but that kind of like grandpa lettuce.

1020
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:20,109
Can I make a piece of lettuce?

1021
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:20,909
Let's see.

1022
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:21,390
What would...

1023
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,270
What would lettuce be?

1024
01:15:22,909 --> 01:15:27,520
But that's not a fruit though.

1025
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:32,039
We'll do a lime.

1026
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:33,079
Or a raisin.

1027
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:34,359
Let's see what we get.

1028
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:39,949
Let's go in here.

1029
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,310
Hmm.

1030
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:50,520
I actually like it already.

1031
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,569
Just a big head for a raisin.

1032
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:01,800
I'm done.

1033
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,789
I'm not gonna do any more...

1034
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:12,189
This is it.

1035
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:26,840
Fix the shoes?

1036
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,170
What's wrong with the Donald Duck shoes?

1037
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:43,920
It's a prune.

1038
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:51,020
Grandpa prune.

1039
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:59,390
All right.

1040
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:00,829
I gotta change the nose a little bit though.

1041
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:01,149
If he's...

1042
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,510
If it's grandpa, grandpa has to have like a really bulbous, fucked up nose.

1043
01:17:05,149 --> 01:17:29,119
If it is a grandpa, how's that?

1044
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,159
Not too crazy.

1045
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:30,640
Just enough.

1046
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:52,329
I have to keep it.

1047
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:53,050
Jesus Christ.

1048
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:54,649
I can't even select anything.

1049
01:17:54,649 --> 01:18:06,159
A little on the buggy side.

1050
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,739
It's old.

1051
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,020
Not that much though.

1052
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:19,159
All right.

1053
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:21,479
Can I get rid of the Wolverine sideburns?

1054
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:30,199
Oh God.

1055
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:30,920
It's like broken.

1056
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:38,159
A little bit more.

1057
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,520
That's gotta be bulbed.

1058
01:18:39,520 --> 01:19:11,180
I need that now.

1059
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,859
What the front?

1060
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:19,680
There we go.

1061
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,239
That's better.

1062
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,119
Okay, good.

1063
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,960
I need the eyes to be spread out a little more than that.

1064
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,520
Bring him up.

1065
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,960
No, that's too too clipped.

1066
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,600
Too much clipping.

1067
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,680
Okay, I'm good with that.

1068
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,350
There they are.

1069
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,369
You just made the old guy from up?

1070
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:02,489
Yeah, I did.

1071
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:03,770
Now I'm gonna leave it like that.

1072
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,470
Except for the sideburns.

1073
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:06,430
They look just stupid.

1074
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,100
Now I miss them.

1075
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:10,539
Shit.

1076
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:22,399
I miss those sideburns now.

1077
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:23,520
Bustache maybe?

1078
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:44,199
Somebody's gotta have a beard, right?

1079
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:44,680
No, I don't...

1080
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,880
The Wolverine looks just...

1081
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:53,239
It doesn't look good.

1082
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:54,199
That one's fine.

1083
01:20:54,199 --> 01:21:04,220
Now I don't like this one because it takes away from his face.

1084
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,199
Bring the shoulders in.

1085
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:30,520
Get the ass a little bit bigger.

1086
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:41,880
Prunes aren't blue.

1087
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,239
Yeah, well, I can't...

1088
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:46,479
I can't make anybody like purple.

1089
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:49,100
All I can do is give them...

1090
01:21:49,100 --> 01:22:00,520
Look, I gave them the correct hair color.

1091
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:10,199
Make them more wrinkly.

1092
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:16,409
Okay, let's get the name here.

1093
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:25,210
Do I just make them green and just call them like a kiwi or something?

1094
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:30,189
I can't...

1095
01:22:30,189 --> 01:22:30,829
I want the...

1096
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:32,029
I'm gonna keep the eyebrows, I think.

1097
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:34,359
Maybe not because he has facial hair.

1098
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:35,479
So why wouldn't I keep the eyebrows?

1099
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:53,880
He does look like a Warcraft gnome.

1100
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,600
It just is.

1101
01:22:57,159 --> 01:22:57,960
Should they be living...

1102
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,880
No, this has to be FRUITS ONLY.

1103
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:11,609
Just pretend he's a Warcraft gnome.

1104
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:12,250
Peter Plumb.

1105
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,560
All right, all right, all right.

1106
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,760
We got one, two, three, four, five in the fruit household.

1107
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:30,060
Let's do some detail work here on the face.

1108
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,380
What the fuck is this?

1109
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,880
It's the creepypasta Plumb with YouTuber hair.

1110
01:23:54,939 --> 01:23:55,579
Put him back.

1111
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,800
What is going on?

1112
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,840
What are these?

1113
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,800
Look at this shit.

1114
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,960
What's with the weird smiling shit?

1115
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,539
I don't know what that means.

1116
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:08,220
That's just a terrible selfie.

1117
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,739
These are all just bad selfies.

1118
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:13,880
You go through and you delete these in your phone.

1119
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:25,289
Okay, more wrinkles.

1120
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,640
These are fate.

1121
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,079
No, this is screwed all up.

1122
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:32,880
Skin detail.

1123
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:44,460
Laugh lines.

1124
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,140
I guess you can kind of see them.

1125
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,340
All right, Peter Plumb is ready.

1126
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,859
Different clothes, though.

1127
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:51,579
These clothes suck.

1128
01:24:52,140 --> 01:25:14,279
Not even purple.

1129
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:18,810
You don't have purple here?

1130
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:28,159
That's fine.

1131
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:29,520
It is a vet shirt, isn't it?

1132
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,000
Why would it...

1133
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,699
Yeah, I'm just realizing this now.

1134
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:35,260
Better.

1135
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:43,359
All right, here's the fruit household.

1136
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:50,119
We've got Pauline Pear, Benedict Banana, Andy Apple, Barry Blueberry, and Peter Plumb.

1137
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,800
It's still a vet.

1138
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,199
That's fine.

1139
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:53,600
He's a vet.

1140
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,000
Change that shirt.

1141
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,159
No.

1142
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,619
All right, let's move them in and we can make another family.

1143
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:13,659
I have to make a drug dealer.

1144
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:15,500
We're going to make the gnome a drug dealer.

1145
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:23,520
I'm going to make him the only one that's worth the shit in this house.

1146
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,640
Okay, more than five is too much.

1147
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,159
This family is ready to go.

1148
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:44,520
Let's make sure to double check.

1149
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,260
Pauline Pear, Benedict Banana, there's the apple.

1150
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:53,229
No, you need to be in your everyday wear.

1151
01:26:55,369 --> 01:26:59,659
This berry, Blueberry, and you got Peter Plumb.

1152
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:08,880
Okay, name him Ben Anna.

1153
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,560
Blueberry.

1154
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,140
Leopard gnome.

1155
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:19,340
I can't get over that.

1156
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,380
I'm trying to get over it.

1157
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:20,859
I can't.

1158
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:28,350
Peter Plumb is the wrong color.

1159
01:27:28,989 --> 01:27:29,789
It doesn't matter.

1160
01:27:29,789 --> 01:27:30,430
Who cares?

1161
01:27:30,989 --> 01:27:34,250
Is that better?

1162
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:53,359
Make him just rotten.

1163
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:02,489
Gray food.

1164
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:13,369
What color is it?

1165
01:28:13,369 --> 01:28:13,689
Plumb.

1166
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:17,399
Second row.

1167
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:21,050
What color is it?

1168
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,460
Plumb.

1169
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,260
Let me see.

1170
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:23,819
Plumb.

1171
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:30,430
Purple.

1172
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:40,140
I think that's, that's actually, that's, I think this is close.

1173
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:40,779
I'm gonna get it.

1174
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:47,609
Is that, that's too, can you see?

1175
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:55,550
Is it purple makeup?

1176
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:56,270
But there might be.

1177
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,800
Probably not full face though.

1178
01:29:03,869 --> 01:29:04,510
Peter Plumb.

1179
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:08,920
Look at the color of prune.

1180
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,520
Prune.

1181
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:16,569
The prunes are like, prunes are raisins.

1182
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:22,430
Now that's close enough.

1183
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:31,020
Just go download more colors.

1184
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:43,739
Is there actually like a, can I actually get a mod that it's,

1185
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:45,100
yeah, but I'd have to leave the game.

1186
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:50,779
Prunes are raisins.

1187
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,359
Get the color wheel mod.

1188
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,039
Yeah, you know, it's probably, it's probably simple.

1189
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:02,840
Can any of the mods give me just a quick link while I finish this up?

1190
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,840
Because I'll get like actual like purple.

1191
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:07,340
It'll be worth it.

1192
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,380
Yeah, it will.

1193
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:09,979
We're taking this long to set this up anyways.

1194
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:16,909
Yeah, most of the mods for The Sims 4 you just drag into the mod folder anyways.

1195
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,000
Let me just close this out.

1196
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,680
I can edit, I can edit the family at any time.

1197
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,880
So this is good to go.

1198
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,680
We'll get that later.

1199
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:38,909
You have to save the family though to use the mod.

1200
01:30:38,909 --> 01:30:39,550
That's all good.

1201
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:39,869
Okay.

1202
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:40,829
So I got this family.

1203
01:30:40,829 --> 01:30:41,470
We're going to move them in.

1204
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,039
Let's see.

1205
01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:48,090
Click the check to save the pear household.

1206
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:51,789
No, this is the, no, this is the fruits.

1207
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:55,630
The fruits household.

1208
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,210
Okay.

1209
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,569
I need to make sure the game is saved.

1210
01:31:10,569 --> 01:31:11,449
That's better.

1211
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:17,600
Now, okay.

1212
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,079
The fruits.

1213
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,039
So they've got 28 grand.

1214
01:31:24,039 --> 01:31:25,239
Let me just cheat real quick.

1215
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:40,699
No way.

1216
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:40,939
Okay.

1217
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:41,819
Hold on.

1218
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:45,390
So this is for, this is one bedroom, two bath.

1219
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,229
This is four bedroom, three bath.

1220
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,750
Weekly rent is $3,500 a week.

1221
01:31:55,069 --> 01:31:55,869
Who's my neighbor?

1222
01:31:57,289 --> 01:31:57,770
Lobo?

1223
01:31:58,329 --> 01:32:08,359
All right.

1224
01:32:08,359 --> 01:32:18,079
This is the one that has to be with only this five people.

1225
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:21,119
Furnishing is a hundred thousand dollars.

1226
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:26,079
A huge family home with luxury chef's kitchen.

1227
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:28,560
This apartment is the epitome of uptown chic living.

1228
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:33,420
Let's go.

1229
01:32:33,979 --> 01:32:41,449
Remaining funds, negative 87,000.

1230
01:32:41,449 --> 01:32:45,100
I don't want the damn thing furnished.

1231
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:51,119
I can't even do this.

1232
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:52,560
I have to move into like a shitty place

1233
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,760
then get a bunch of money and move.

1234
01:32:57,069 --> 01:32:58,750
Type free real estate.

1235
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:10,329
Command fail.

1236
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:17,550
Free, you need to enable cheats.

1237
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,829
Testing cheats on.

1238
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:23,920
Oh, is it on?

1239
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:37,279
Command fail.

1240
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,800
I need to move a family in first.

1241
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:47,449
Yes, I have to like go to one of these shitty places then.

1242
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:49,130
I'm just gonna Google it before I just get debated

1243
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:50,250
for the next 30 minutes.

1244
01:33:51,229 --> 01:33:52,109
Sims cheats.

1245
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,479
Open the cheat console.

1246
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:58,670
Bring up the cheat dialog box.

1247
01:33:58,670 --> 01:33:59,149
Enter cheats.

1248
01:33:59,149 --> 01:34:00,109
Don't forget to press the yeah.

1249
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:00,829
Okay.

1250
01:34:00,829 --> 01:34:01,149
Thanks.

1251
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:06,840
Thanks for telling me how to open the cheat box.

1252
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:09,609
Hey, here's how you open the cheat box.

1253
01:34:10,329 --> 01:34:11,289
That's it.

1254
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:11,850
Okay, thanks.

1255
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:18,619
All right, here we go.

1256
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:21,260
I'm gonna get like five auto playing videos.

1257
01:34:21,899 --> 01:34:25,020
Okay.

1258
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:28,729
Testing cheats space true.

1259
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:37,289
Okay.

1260
01:34:37,289 --> 01:34:47,020
Now, let's see if that does anything.

1261
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:04,399
All right, so I'm just gonna move.

1262
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:05,760
I have to move into a random place.

1263
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,880
Why can't I just do it from the menu?

1264
01:35:14,779 --> 01:35:16,619
All right, I need to find like a little shitty apartment.

1265
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:21,710
All of us have to move in here.

1266
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:22,350
All right, good luck.

1267
01:35:24,189 --> 01:35:27,229
Would you like to move in with or evict the Pizzai victim?

1268
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:28,510
Get the fuck out of my way.

1269
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:40,479
Yeah, I got rid of the pizza family.

1270
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:41,520
All right, here we go.

1271
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,850
This is really important.

1272
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:46,890
I have to like pause the game

1273
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,890
because there are a ton of fucked up mods.

1274
01:35:49,449 --> 01:35:55,210
And I need to be totally sure that nothing happens here when I'm gone.

1275
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,170
Because if I get...

1276
01:35:56,170 --> 01:35:56,649
Hold on.

1277
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,930
What are you doing?

1278
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:01,449
No, no, no, no.

1279
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:02,010
Go back, go back, go back.

1280
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:03,850
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1281
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:04,810
What the hell just happened?

1282
01:36:05,869 --> 01:36:07,550
Get in here before everybody kills each other.

1283
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:07,869
Come on.

1284
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:14,680
How do I...

1285
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,479
What just happened?

1286
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,670
Oh my God.

1287
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:25,630
Okay, thank God.

1288
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:26,430
There we go.

1289
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:46,189
All right, let's get out of here.

1290
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:47,069
That's good.

1291
01:36:47,069 --> 01:36:57,770
All right, let's live right here.

1292
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:58,090
Move.

1293
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:01,850
Invite up to seven other Sims.

1294
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,250
Select sit...

1295
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:02,890
No, no, no, no.

1296
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:03,130
Buy.

1297
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,760
We're traveling.

1298
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:07,210
Okay, do I...

1299
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:08,729
How do I like get them out of here?

1300
01:37:08,729 --> 01:37:14,760
You have to use your phone to move.

1301
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,670
Oh, okay.

1302
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,220
Check social media.

1303
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,500
Plan an event.

1304
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,300
Work.

1305
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,770
Household.

1306
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,369
Here's the dealing drugs.

1307
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:26,670
Household.

1308
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,439
Buy a retail, buy a vet.

1309
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:30,159
Purchase gifts.

1310
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:30,960
Hire a service.

1311
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:44,460
God damn it.

1312
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,180
Oh, fuck that.

1313
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,779
You evicted people to move somewhere else.

1314
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,310
Travel.

1315
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:50,989
Move household.

1316
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:51,949
That's not traveling.

1317
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,369
Okay, okay.

1318
01:37:59,369 --> 01:38:00,090
Move household.

1319
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,479
Oh, don't...

1320
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:04,119
Be careful.

1321
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:05,000
Don't do anything stupid.

1322
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:10,060
Don't do anything stupid.

1323
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:10,619
Wait.

1324
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:11,500
Everybody just wait.

1325
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:11,899
Get in.

1326
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:14,170
Make the call.

1327
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:14,970
Hurry up.

1328
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:29,899
Bingo.

1329
01:38:29,899 --> 01:38:30,380
Let's move.

1330
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,500
The fruits household is moving.

1331
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,039
Keep furniture.

1332
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:38,520
Wait.

1333
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,560
No, no, no, no.

1334
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,520
Sell furniture.

1335
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,039
I'm not going to bring all the furniture with me.

1336
01:38:42,039 --> 01:38:42,439
Furnished.

1337
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:43,319
Let's go.

1338
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:59,100
So, welcome to the stream, everybody.

1339
01:39:00,939 --> 01:39:03,100
Here is why I wanted to do this in the first place.

1340
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:05,470
This is first person.

1341
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:07,069
On the Sims 4.

1342
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:13,789
I'm going to go ahead and save it real quick.

1343
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:17,210
Save as...

1344
01:39:20,619 --> 01:39:22,300
Call this the fruit household.

1345
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:22,699
Fruits.

1346
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,720
Okay.

1347
01:39:26,439 --> 01:39:28,970
My current game.

1348
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:29,930
That's fine.

1349
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:30,250
Save.

1350
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:32,859
All right.

1351
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:35,920
Here we are.

1352
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,680
Let's just test a few things to make sure they work.

1353
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,680
This place is fucking huge and it's beautiful.

1354
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:47,689
Get to know.

1355
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:49,770
More choices.

1356
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,170
There's...

1357
01:39:51,289 --> 01:39:52,329
Sim Torments.

1358
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,409
This is a new one.

1359
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:58,029
I don't want to do this right off the bat.

1360
01:40:01,369 --> 01:40:03,689
But sometimes you just have to try.

1361
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,539
No, no, no, no.

1362
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:23,659
Plead, plead, plead.

1363
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:23,979
All right.

1364
01:40:23,979 --> 01:40:25,340
This is perfect already.

1365
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,460
We can't jump right into...

1366
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,899
I was supposed to wait.

1367
01:40:27,899 --> 01:40:28,380
No, no, no.

1368
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:28,939
Load game.

1369
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:31,020
Load game.

1370
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:31,979
I'm going to load the game.

1371
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:41,579
And we can't go that hard yet.

1372
01:40:41,579 --> 01:40:42,300
Okay.

1373
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,960
Everything's going to be just fine.

1374
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:52,250
Load game.

1375
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,439
That's it.

1376
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,560
See you later.

1377
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,920
That's pretty much what the stream is.

1378
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,720
See you tomorrow.

1379
01:41:03,689 --> 01:41:04,890
So we have the fruits here.

1380
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:09,869
I need to make a couple of people before we do anything.

1381
01:41:09,869 --> 01:41:11,069
In the same complex, maybe?

1382
01:41:11,069 --> 01:41:12,430
Can I get rid of Lobo?

1383
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,060
We need them to have neighbors.

1384
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,420
There are already people that are here.

1385
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:25,819
Let me see some of the neighbors, though.

1386
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:29,710
Who lives here?

1387
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:30,989
Nobody.

1388
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:34,060
Who lives here?

1389
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,479
The Feng family.

1390
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:43,710
So we will come across random people who have been randomly generated.

1391
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:47,159
The karaoke legends.

1392
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:51,529
I'm not going to kill Lobo.

1393
01:41:51,529 --> 01:41:53,289
No, not yet.

1394
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:59,000
We need to get started first.

1395
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,100
I'm not killing Lobo.

1396
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,199
But I will make...

1397
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,640
We have to make one more family.

1398
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:11,579
Somebody has to be the drug dealer.

1399
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:14,649
We need to kill Lobo for the fireplace.

1400
01:42:14,649 --> 01:42:15,130
Not yet.

1401
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,560
Let's go back here.

1402
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:25,180
And not destinations.

1403
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:29,069
Where's the new family?

1404
01:42:29,069 --> 01:42:29,789
Create a new household.

1405
01:42:29,789 --> 01:42:30,029
Okay.

1406
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,399
I need to make the gnome.

1407
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:38,170
Gnome.

1408
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:40,600
It doesn't matter.

1409
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:43,899
Gnome is just anything.

1410
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:48,079
Uh, what is this?

1411
01:42:58,750 --> 01:42:59,630
Male pregnancy.

1412
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:01,949
Okay.

1413
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:10,119
Let's go ahead and do formal wear.

1414
01:43:10,119 --> 01:43:11,319
It's going to be the costume as well.

1415
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:13,850
That car, man.

1416
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:16,039
I'm going to abuse that.

1417
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,770
No, I'm not a gnoblin.

1418
01:43:34,329 --> 01:43:39,529
I don't know why I'm doing this.

1419
01:43:39,529 --> 01:43:40,329
This is...

1420
01:43:40,329 --> 01:43:43,739
I'm just embracing the ultimate...

1421
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:55,069
I'm embracing the ultimate annoying meme right now.

1422
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:55,869
Oh, formal.

1423
01:43:55,869 --> 01:43:57,069
I can't change formal wear.

1424
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:03,449
Is it just a randomized button?

1425
01:44:03,449 --> 01:44:03,770
There is.

1426
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:19,600
Wow.

1427
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,640
That was a gnome right there.

1428
01:44:24,329 --> 01:44:24,810
That's fine.

1429
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:26,090
You can look just like this.

1430
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,100
Just remove formal wear.

1431
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:34,140
Uh, okay.

1432
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:34,380
Cool.

1433
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:38,010
Full body.

1434
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:39,369
Let's get that gnome outfit on.

1435
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:45,020
All right.

1436
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:45,420
Watch out.

1437
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,640
Sportswear.

1438
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,029
Doesn't matter where we are.

1439
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:53,949
You're always going to be in that.

1440
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:00,920
Sleepwear.

1441
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,159
Yep.

1442
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:03,720
Doesn't matter.

1443
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:10,380
I guess I could just type in gnome, couldn't I?

1444
01:45:18,569 --> 01:45:18,890
No.

1445
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:20,840
Where the fuck is it?

1446
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:29,180
Where is it?

1447
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:35,199
Am I going to not use it here?

1448
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,039
You can't go to sleep in the giant costume?

1449
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:44,619
Do I actually keep this in it?

1450
01:45:44,619 --> 01:45:53,289
No, I do not.

1451
01:45:53,289 --> 01:45:53,770
I do.

1452
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:54,970
What a fucking idiot.

1453
01:45:54,970 --> 01:46:09,840
Can you actually go swimming in this?

1454
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,359
Oh, there's going to be so much to do.

1455
01:46:13,069 --> 01:46:14,590
There's so much to do.

1456
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:25,880
Is this person going to die inside of this costume?

1457
01:46:29,319 --> 01:46:32,199
They really might.

1458
01:46:32,199 --> 01:46:32,600
All right.

1459
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,079
Looking good.

1460
01:46:36,729 --> 01:46:38,170
Pretty close too, actually.

1461
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:38,649
For voice.

1462
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:51,819
That looks good.

1463
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,239
Okay.

1464
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,420
Uh, deviancy.

1465
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:00,880
Mischief.

1466
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:03,720
Uh, I need to put on...

1467
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,210
I think I need to put on, like, the drug.

1468
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:11,720
Where is...

1469
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,279
I actually think there's a drug dealer trait that I have to put on.

1470
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:19,640
Incredibly popular, by the way.

1471
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,680
Joke Star or...

1472
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,500
I mean, I have to do Joke Star.

1473
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:25,770
Let's see here.

1474
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:26,329
Where is...

1475
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:33,039
These sims refrain from using alcohol.

1476
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,399
No, no, no.

1477
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:34,880
Where is it?

1478
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,579
They actually have to have this trait.

1479
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,960
Neat slob.

1480
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,760
Lazy.

1481
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,479
Where is it?

1482
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:47,279
Am I missing it here?

1483
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:49,439
Evil.

1484
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,420
Committal.

1485
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:53,819
Mean.

1486
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:54,380
Insider.

1487
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:59,310
Kleptomania.

1488
01:47:59,310 --> 01:47:59,630
Am I...

1489
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,829
What is wrong with me?

1490
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,420
I'm looking for, like, drug dealer.

1491
01:48:11,899 --> 01:48:12,300
Oh.

1492
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:12,699
It's got...

1493
01:48:12,699 --> 01:48:12,939
I can't...

1494
01:48:12,939 --> 01:48:13,899
That's because it's, like...

1495
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:14,619
That looks weird.

1496
01:48:14,619 --> 01:48:15,659
It's, like, rolled up.

1497
01:48:16,539 --> 01:48:17,579
That looks like a cork.

1498
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,539
I was expecting to look for, like, drugs.

1499
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:24,000
I'm not a wine cork.

1500
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,229
All right.

1501
01:48:27,229 --> 01:48:27,789
Here we go.

1502
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:28,590
Materialistic.

1503
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:35,369
And, uh, evil.

1504
01:48:35,369 --> 01:48:41,739
Sounds good.

1505
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,960
Let's put you somewhere.

1506
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:48,909
Anything else I need to do?

1507
01:48:48,909 --> 01:48:49,470
I don't think so.

1508
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:53,659
Animals?

1509
01:48:53,659 --> 01:48:55,739
No, we did the drug dealer animal house already.

1510
01:48:59,899 --> 01:49:01,420
An evil meal chum.

1511
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:05,720
Who else would live in this house?

1512
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,279
What are some of the fucking stupid memes that I could put in here?

1513
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:09,560
In, like, the drug meme house?

1514
01:49:10,359 --> 01:49:12,640
Let me see.

1515
01:49:21,739 --> 01:49:22,300
Garfield?

1516
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:24,279
Put the vroomer...

1517
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:25,800
No, the vroomer's gonna have his own house.

1518
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,579
No.

1519
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:28,859
This...

1520
01:49:28,859 --> 01:49:30,300
The drug dealer's gonna have their own house.

1521
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:32,350
Just one little apartment.

1522
01:49:32,989 --> 01:49:37,659
We'll have the meme house in a minute here.

1523
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:46,880
That's enough for, um, not a gonoblin.

1524
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,560
Is there one where he jumps in front of the camera?

1525
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,119
That looks good.

1526
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:56,729
Not directly next door.

1527
01:49:56,729 --> 01:49:57,930
Some little, just...

1528
01:49:57,930 --> 01:49:59,369
Let's put you in, like, a little dump.

1529
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:07,500
Who lives around here?

1530
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:07,899
Nobody.

1531
01:50:11,659 --> 01:50:13,100
I should live with Garfield.

1532
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,479
This one's fine.

1533
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:20,430
No, no, no.

1534
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:21,470
One bedroom.

1535
01:50:21,470 --> 01:50:25,800
There's often a party going on.

1536
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,279
That's fine.

1537
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,279
All right, he's in the world.

1538
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:41,680
Who the hell is this?

1539
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:45,199
Who is this person?

1540
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:49,850
Did someone else live...

1541
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:50,890
I thought this place was empty.

1542
01:50:58,109 --> 01:51:00,430
Oh, I've been going right for the video games.

1543
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:01,229
Wee bowling.

1544
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:04,409
Not gonna run her over.

1545
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:05,449
We can't do that yet.

1546
01:51:05,449 --> 01:51:06,649
Everyone has to just relax.

1547
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:18,649
Okay, settings.

1548
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:20,250
Assign NPCs.

1549
01:51:21,789 --> 01:51:22,590
A shaman?

1550
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,159
Wait.

1551
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,439
Hold on.

1552
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,600
I think he needs to have, like, a certain...

1553
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,640
He's the drug dealer right now.

1554
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:31,960
Let's see.

1555
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:32,760
Let's open up the phone.

1556
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:34,760
Dealing.

1557
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:36,699
Doctor's appointment.

1558
01:51:36,699 --> 01:51:37,739
Invite the shaman over.

1559
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:38,539
I remember the shaman.

1560
01:51:38,539 --> 01:51:38,859
All right.

1561
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,619
Doctor's appointment is 100 bucks.

1562
01:51:40,619 --> 01:51:41,260
What does that do?

1563
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:49,659
Am I going to the doctor to get drugs?

1564
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,800
Feeling a bit under the weather?

1565
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,159
God, not a.

1566
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:55,239
Come by and we'll get you a checkup.

1567
01:51:55,239 --> 01:52:01,550
How do I, like, zoom in on him?

1568
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,239
Can I show him?

1569
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:04,199
Does he see him in the game world?

1570
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,409
There's nothing wrong with you.

1571
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:08,010
Don't hesitate to call us

1572
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:10,329
if you actually feel depressed though.

1573
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:13,840
I think I just got drugs.

1574
01:52:19,079 --> 01:52:19,720
Uh, okay.

1575
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:20,119
Hold on.

1576
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:32,220
Is he just going to do drugs?

1577
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:35,600
What was inventory?

1578
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,789
Where is their inventory?

1579
01:52:41,789 --> 01:52:42,989
It's, like, down here somewhere, right?

1580
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:45,260
It's career inventory.

1581
01:52:45,899 --> 01:52:47,359
You don't got anything, man.

1582
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:57,050
I'm supposed to run him over.

1583
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,640
He's currently making gnome videos.

1584
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:09,340
He just joined chat.

1585
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:10,619
He's just putting it in the chat right now.

1586
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,439
Okay, let me save it again here.

1587
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:19,689
Oh, let me try this one.

1588
01:53:19,689 --> 01:53:20,189
Oh.

1589
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:28,159
Call over partners in crime.

1590
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:37,689
Take a selfie with a gun.

1591
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:41,229
I'll use this one in my next video.

1592
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,880
I can't even see.

1593
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:50,489
He's too small.

1594
01:53:52,569 --> 01:53:53,609
Where's the gun?

1595
01:53:53,609 --> 01:54:09,279
No, it's because I was in a weird spot.

1596
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:10,479
He's still holding the gun.

1597
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,479
And we still have some population to take care of.

1598
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:24,810
You can upgrade that.

1599
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:36,159
Try to calm down in...

1600
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,359
No, he's not going to kill anybody.

1601
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:39,920
Automatic killing is off at the moment.

1602
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:43,739
All right, that's fine.

1603
01:54:43,739 --> 01:54:45,100
He's doing just fine.

1604
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:45,819
Let's head back.

1605
01:54:45,819 --> 01:54:47,100
Make our last household.

1606
01:54:47,739 --> 01:54:56,010
Wait a minute.

1607
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:56,970
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1608
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:00,970
Holy fuck.

1609
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:02,720
The ghost!

1610
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,199
Say hello!

1611
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:20,399
It's Alita Battle Angel.

1612
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:24,350
What does that guy have on the plate?

1613
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:26,090
Is it like a meat cake?

1614
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:40,890
Oh, what's this?

1615
01:55:42,279 --> 01:55:42,920
Fucking dick.

1616
01:55:51,899 --> 01:55:52,300
Funny...

1617
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,949
I knocked...

1618
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,069
I delay knocked him out.

1619
01:55:57,069 --> 01:55:59,560
He was at like 6,000 ping.

1620
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:00,060
All right.

1621
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,960
Let's tell an unbelievable story.

1622
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,920
That was such a delayed knockout.

1623
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,000
Fell asleep in five seconds.

1624
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:14,939
No, I can't do it.

1625
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:16,539
I can't do it.

1626
01:56:17,579 --> 01:56:18,380
Please.

1627
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,579
We can't go this far.

1628
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:34,890
It's too late to go.

1629
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,289
I can't.

1630
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:36,250
I have to do.

1631
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:37,210
We have to go fake.

1632
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,300
I can't let this get out of control

1633
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,659
this quickly into the stream.

1634
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:52,460
Somebody just...

1635
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:53,579
And the chat just broke.

1636
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:56,460
Can someone please explain what the fuck just happened?

1637
01:57:18,439 --> 01:57:19,239
No one's safe.

1638
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,840
Even inside.

1639
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,119
You're not even safe.

1640
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:24,760
What else is there?

1641
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,960
I just need to see what they do.

1642
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:27,960
What?

1643
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,039
What is snatch self?

1644
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:56,699
Okay, okay.

1645
01:58:05,949 --> 01:58:10,359
It's gonna be a long night.

1646
01:58:10,359 --> 01:58:10,840
I needed to...

1647
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:11,239
I just need...

1648
01:58:11,239 --> 01:58:12,680
This is the test period.

1649
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,970
I just need to test.

1650
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:16,010
All I'm doing is testing.

1651
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:17,449
I haven't seen these yet.

1652
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:24,109
What?

1653
01:58:24,109 --> 01:58:24,829
P self?

1654
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:31,689
He's gone.

1655
01:58:31,689 --> 01:58:42,189
I don't know what this means.

1656
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:49,710
What?

1657
01:58:55,239 --> 01:58:56,920
I don't understand what just happened.

1658
01:58:57,399 --> 01:58:58,920
Why does this person have a face?

1659
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,439
Why does death have a face?

1660
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:07,439
Death should not have a face?

1661
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:07,680
This is...

1662
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,119
No, I can't believe it.

1663
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,399
This is ridiculous.

1664
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:17,199
You took my...

1665
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:22,760
Gang...

1666
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:23,640
There's so much here.

1667
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:23,960
All right.

1668
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,760
It's time to go back.

1669
01:59:25,319 --> 01:59:46,729
That's P.

1670
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:48,960
All right.

1671
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,680
So we've seen what some of these do.

1672
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,409
Who's crying?

1673
01:59:57,359 --> 01:59:58,560
I'm crying.

1674
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:06,220
Okay.

1675
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:06,779
It's time to go.

1676
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:08,539
We gotta make our final person.

1677
02:00:12,189 --> 02:00:13,630
Send to hell.

1678
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:16,170
Crack neck?

1679
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,239
Body slam?

1680
02:00:19,239 --> 02:00:21,000
Who does the body slamming?

1681
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:36,810
That kills you?

1682
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:37,289
He's dead.

1683
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,800
The game saved...

1684
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,399
Currently in a state where saving isn't possible.

1685
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:45,680
Don't save.

1686
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:56,569
I'm gonna load game.

1687
02:00:56,569 --> 02:00:58,010
This is the one right here.

1688
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:04,489
I just want to see what they did.

1689
02:01:07,979 --> 02:01:09,420
There is the gnome.

1690
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,140
Final family.

1691
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:11,500
This is the last bit before we just...

1692
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:12,539
We're gonna play.

1693
02:01:12,539 --> 02:01:14,039
We will get to playing.

1694
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:14,760
I promise you this.

1695
02:01:17,239 --> 02:01:18,920
This is the final household.

1696
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:22,920
There's gonna be about three or four people in this household.

1697
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,520
This is the fucking meme family.

1698
02:01:37,149 --> 02:01:37,649
Uh...

1699
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:39,939
Vroomer.

1700
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:44,439
I'm just gonna do randomize until I find the right one.

1701
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:54,760
The memes?

1702
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,399
The memers?

1703
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:00,060
How about Vroomer?

1704
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:05,069
Who gives a shit?

1705
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,609
Vroomer McBoomer?

1706
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:14,800
Vroomer the Reinhardt family.

1707
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,199
Okay.

1708
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:15,520
Fine.

1709
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:15,760
Sure.

1710
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,010
All right.

1711
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:20,890
Final household.

1712
02:02:21,449 --> 02:02:23,449
This is an absolute dickhead.

1713
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:27,130
Make enemies and be a famous criminal.

1714
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:27,609
Yeah.

1715
02:02:27,609 --> 02:02:28,489
You're a pain in the ass.

1716
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:31,800
Incredibly active.

1717
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:35,279
Uh...

1718
02:02:35,279 --> 02:02:36,560
Is there a car lover?

1719
02:02:38,939 --> 02:02:39,500
Erratic?

1720
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,560
Mm-hmm.

1721
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,119
Loves the outdoors.

1722
02:02:46,119 --> 02:02:46,760
Can't get enough.

1723
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:50,510
Mean.

1724
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:52,569
No.

1725
02:02:52,569 --> 02:02:53,289
Mean and evil.

1726
02:02:53,850 --> 02:03:01,789
By the way, if you're curious,

1727
02:03:01,789 --> 02:03:05,310
this is the person that just drives by three or four times a day,

1728
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:06,989
and they just step on the gas as hard as they can.

1729
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:11,949
If you don't know who this is.

1730
02:03:11,949 --> 02:03:12,750
Let's randomize.

1731
02:03:15,609 --> 02:03:16,970
Oh, that's close.

1732
02:03:18,159 --> 02:03:22,479
I'm gonna randomize until I see the person that I think is driving by.

1733
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:24,659
Close.

1734
02:03:26,079 --> 02:03:26,579
No.

1735
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:37,819
I think I found them.

1736
02:03:46,800 --> 02:04:21,899
Okay.

1737
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:27,359
Oops.

1738
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:29,840
Oh, shit.

1739
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:31,439
No, come back up.

1740
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:32,079
Back up. Back up.

1741
02:04:38,619 --> 02:04:39,739
You're just making a Chad.

1742
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:41,760
This is not a Chad.

1743
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:44,819
Um...

1744
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:46,399
I didn't do that, but fine.

1745
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:55,130
Somehow better.

1746
02:04:55,130 --> 02:05:07,640
Why do they always have such fucked up chins?

1747
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:08,989
There we go.

1748
02:05:08,989 --> 02:05:09,470
I can...

1749
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:10,270
That's who's...

1750
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:11,229
That's who you are.

1751
02:05:11,229 --> 02:05:17,949
I know it.

1752
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:19,630
Put an ad out for this guy.

1753
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:22,890
To be arrested for speeding.

1754
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:30,670
This is the police sketch of what they look like.

1755
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:59,359
Cat ears.

1756
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:00,399
It just keeps getting better.

1757
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:03,640
That was not bad.

1758
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,140
This is...

1759
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:10,359
No, I'm kind of making just Nico from GTA IV.

1760
02:06:10,359 --> 02:06:26,920
I want to go back to the clown here.

1761
02:06:27,979 --> 02:06:28,539
Whoever this is.

1762
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:29,899
This person is a fucking clown.

1763
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:31,960
Oh, no.

1764
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,079
No, no.

1765
02:06:35,079 --> 02:06:36,680
That's not the person that's driving around.

1766
02:06:37,239 --> 02:06:38,359
This is clown.

1767
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:51,609
Okay.

1768
02:06:51,609 --> 02:06:54,300
Oh, that's like Amish.

1769
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:01,310
That's my haircut.

1770
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,310
This is not even close to my haircut.

1771
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:14,119
All right, what about for clothes?

1772
02:07:23,449 --> 02:07:26,090
Give him like a Twitch hoodie?

1773
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:26,970
Clown suit?

1774
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:28,880
No, no, no, no.

1775
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,159
Like, this is cool.

1776
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:42,000
Change something here one more time.

1777
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:55,770
That's better.

1778
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:56,890
Oh, God. 50 bucks.

1779
02:07:58,779 --> 02:07:59,420
Mostly lost.

1780
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:00,779
Just gave 50 dollars.

1781
02:08:00,779 --> 02:08:01,420
Thank you.

1782
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,020
I'm not going to let you continue without making this guy's personality bro.

1783
02:08:10,039 --> 02:08:10,920
Is there a bro?

1784
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,239
Outgoing?

1785
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,079
Yeah, but they're mean and evil.

1786
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,399
And they're incredibly erratic.

1787
02:08:23,399 --> 02:08:27,420
They just drive by the house every day.

1788
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:28,140
No, you're right.

1789
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:37,979
That's good enough.

1790
02:08:40,039 --> 02:08:40,439
Formal?

1791
02:08:44,729 --> 02:08:47,100
You dress like a dickhead.

1792
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,140
That's your formal wear?

1793
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:48,699
No jacket?

1794
02:08:51,079 --> 02:08:52,600
You show up to work with no suit jacket on?

1795
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:58,680
All right.

1796
02:08:58,680 --> 02:08:59,479
Next, we've got...

1797
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:01,560
Who else can I put here?

1798
02:09:04,189 --> 02:09:05,069
Oh, let's see here.

1799
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:22,439
Nice.

1800
02:09:22,439 --> 02:09:22,920
That's fine.

1801
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,869
I'll show you what I have for hair.

1802
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:29,229
It's more like that.

1803
02:09:29,789 --> 02:09:38,300
No, I don't look like Cyclops.

1804
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:41,449
Last time I made myself a joke.

1805
02:09:41,449 --> 02:09:43,850
This time I'm going to make what I actually look like.

1806
02:09:43,850 --> 02:10:26,300
Get in there.

1807
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:53,640
I don't mean hair is not correct.

1808
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:54,520
Yes, it is.

1809
02:10:54,520 --> 02:11:29,159
I know what I look like.

1810
02:11:29,159 --> 02:11:30,680
And this is what I see in the mirror.

1811
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:48,350
Put on the webcam to compare.

1812
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:48,750
Hold on.

1813
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:49,069
I will.

1814
02:11:49,069 --> 02:11:50,189
I just got to put clothes on.

1815
02:11:50,189 --> 02:11:51,390
I got to put like something on.

1816
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:55,000
Be right back.

1817
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:15,680
Okay, here.

1818
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:16,399
Incoming joke.

1819
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,239
There's no joke.

1820
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:24,460
I just don't have big clothes on.

1821
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,180
Let's see.

1822
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:26,699
Let's see how accurate this is.

1823
02:12:26,699 --> 02:13:36,829
You're going to turn this a little...

1824
02:14:02,329 --> 02:14:03,770
This is what I see.

1825
02:14:03,770 --> 02:14:04,409
Okay?

1826
02:14:04,409 --> 02:14:55,050
I think that's good.

1827
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:55,529
Right?

1828
02:14:55,529 --> 02:15:03,020
There it is.

1829
02:15:03,020 --> 02:15:09,159
I think that looks pretty close.

1830
02:15:09,159 --> 02:15:27,579
I need a bigger chin.

1831
02:15:27,579 --> 02:15:33,340
Are you sure?

1832
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:36,960
No fucking way I don't look like that.

1833
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,840
Bullshit.

1834
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,779
I can't look.

1835
02:15:40,779 --> 02:16:10,359
That's better.

1836
02:16:10,359 --> 02:16:15,770
Are these out far enough?

1837
02:16:15,770 --> 02:16:20,010
See?

1838
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:37,120
I think that's fine.

1839
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,079
The lips are too big.

1840
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:50,879
Hold on.

1841
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:56,920
Let me get in there.

1842
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,159
Okay.

1843
02:16:57,159 --> 02:16:57,959
That looks fine.

1844
02:16:57,959 --> 02:17:08,440
I'm going to grab the corners though.

1845
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:08,920
How far?

1846
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:09,159
That's...

1847
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:10,040
This is kind of up.

1848
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:18,809
Yeah.

1849
02:17:18,809 --> 02:17:23,340
Higher.

1850
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:24,299
This ratio is wrong.

1851
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:25,579
These eyebrows are going to come down.

1852
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:29,719
Well, the eyes have to go up.

1853
02:17:29,719 --> 02:17:33,520
Yeah.

1854
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:34,479
This has to come down.

1855
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:35,360
There we go.

1856
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:55,819
Am I getting there?

1857
02:17:55,819 --> 02:17:57,549
The nose is too big.

1858
02:17:57,549 --> 02:18:26,569
Eyebrows have to change.

1859
02:18:26,569 --> 02:18:27,129
No.

1860
02:18:27,129 --> 02:18:30,600
There we go.

1861
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:32,760
Bring them down.

1862
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:35,879
Bring these out.

1863
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:15,399
I mean, it looks pretty similar.

1864
02:19:15,399 --> 02:19:16,200
Skin tone.

1865
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:16,600
Yeah.

1866
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:16,920
Hold on.

1867
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,239
You're right.

1868
02:19:17,239 --> 02:19:18,360
I got to get the skin tone right.

1869
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:39,850
There they go.

1870
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:42,459
I think that's it.

1871
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:47,739
Let's do it.

1872
02:19:48,139 --> 02:19:49,340
Let's get the whole thing, right?

1873
02:19:49,340 --> 02:20:13,709
The hair is not right?

1874
02:20:13,709 --> 02:20:18,760
No.

1875
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,479
No.

1876
02:20:19,479 --> 02:20:36,090
I think it's perfect.

1877
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:43,260
Like that.

1878
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:47,850
This is actually what I see in the mirror.

1879
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:48,409
Eyebrows.

1880
02:20:48,409 --> 02:20:49,129
Look at my eyebrow.

1881
02:20:49,129 --> 02:20:49,610
But look at...

1882
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:51,709
Look at...

1883
02:20:51,709 --> 02:21:02,840
See?

1884
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:03,719
He's a bigger.

1885
02:21:03,719 --> 02:21:24,879
All right.

1886
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:26,239
Now they're just doing it on purpose.

1887
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:36,319
That looks good.

1888
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:37,440
Forehead's bigger.

1889
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:54,040
Add lipstick.

1890
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:55,559
Why would I add lipstick?

1891
02:21:55,559 --> 02:22:00,459
All right.

1892
02:22:00,459 --> 02:22:00,780
What about...

1893
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,139
What about if a clothes on right now?

1894
02:22:02,139 --> 02:22:02,459
None.

1895
02:22:02,459 --> 02:22:03,420
I actually don't have any.

1896
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,639
No, I wouldn't wear this.

1897
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:14,040
I wouldn't wear that.

1898
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,559
My chin's bigger than this.

1899
02:22:15,559 --> 02:22:17,239
It is definitely not bigger than...

1900
02:22:17,239 --> 02:22:20,159
You want to make me look like a cartoon character?

1901
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:23,840
Pretty stylish.

1902
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:24,239
No.

1903
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:24,719
I don't want...

1904
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:25,840
No.

1905
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,200
Not the black shirt.

1906
02:22:29,309 --> 02:22:29,950
Let's go with...

1907
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:36,829
I don't want to do like fucking Civil War Soldier.

1908
02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:42,010
Do they have any Star Wars shirts?

1909
02:22:42,829 --> 02:22:43,309
Wait.

1910
02:22:43,309 --> 02:22:44,030
They probably do.

1911
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:46,729
They have a Darth Vader mask.

1912
02:22:46,729 --> 02:22:48,809
You tell me they don't have a Star Wars t-shirt?

1913
02:22:48,809 --> 02:22:54,989
Where the hell is it?

1914
02:22:54,989 --> 02:22:55,469
Come on.

1915
02:22:55,469 --> 02:22:56,190
Star Wars.

1916
02:22:59,239 --> 02:23:05,870
Damn it.

1917
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:07,549
I don't want the headphones on.

1918
02:23:07,549 --> 02:23:10,360
Let's go full body for a second.

1919
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:17,159
I have a big fan of Star Wars but that's not...

1920
02:23:17,159 --> 02:23:17,879
I'm not...

1921
02:23:17,879 --> 02:23:18,680
I wouldn't wear this.

1922
02:23:19,319 --> 02:23:22,969
Just be in the Vader costume.

1923
02:23:28,909 --> 02:23:30,430
This would be my formal outfit.

1924
02:23:30,430 --> 02:23:30,750
Okay?

1925
02:23:38,649 --> 02:23:39,450
Every day though.

1926
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:42,010
Let's go with like a tank top.

1927
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:42,409
Okay.

1928
02:23:42,409 --> 02:23:42,969
T-shirts.

1929
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:44,809
Star Wars.

1930
02:23:44,809 --> 02:23:45,610
Star Wars.

1931
02:23:47,319 --> 02:23:47,879
Tank top.

1932
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:51,319
Pretty close.

1933
02:23:51,319 --> 02:23:52,120
Sweatshirts.

1934
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:52,280
No.

1935
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:55,200
That's fine.

1936
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:57,159
Bottoms.

1937
02:23:58,559 --> 02:23:59,440
Let's go with...

1938
02:24:02,989 --> 02:24:03,309
I mean...

1939
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:05,799
Just a pair of jeans.

1940
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,920
Yeah, that's fine.

1941
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:12,299
That's pretty close to what I would wear.

1942
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:17,049
Especially in Las Vegas.

1943
02:24:21,579 --> 02:24:23,260
Put those things away.

1944
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:24,059
What do you mean put the...

1945
02:24:24,059 --> 02:24:24,780
What the things?

1946
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:28,510
All right.

1947
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:29,229
I'm happy with this.

1948
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:31,559
My personality.

1949
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:33,079
I'm an animal.

1950
02:24:33,079 --> 02:24:35,159
No.

1951
02:24:35,159 --> 02:24:38,520
I would say let's do like creativity.

1952
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:40,200
I mean like genius.

1953
02:24:41,079 --> 02:24:42,440
Best-selling author.

1954
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:44,649
Knowledge.

1955
02:24:44,649 --> 02:24:46,010
Really smart.

1956
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:47,530
Computer whiz.

1957
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:50,190
Wicked.

1958
02:24:50,190 --> 02:24:50,989
Popular.

1959
02:24:50,989 --> 02:24:51,790
Joke star.

1960
02:24:55,659 --> 02:24:56,620
Leader of the pack.

1961
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,180
I'm a leader.

1962
02:24:57,819 --> 02:24:59,370
Little hot-headed.

1963
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:02,040
Very, very creative, aren't I?

1964
02:25:04,430 --> 02:25:06,030
And I also am very clumsy.

1965
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,159
I'm good.

1966
02:25:16,409 --> 02:25:16,649
No.

1967
02:25:17,610 --> 02:25:17,930
Fine.

1968
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:21,399
So who lives here?

1969
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:22,120
Oh yeah, I forgot.

1970
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:23,079
I've made this person.

1971
02:25:26,329 --> 02:25:28,969
That is not at all what the person probably looks like.

1972
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:33,309
Can I go back and delete...

1973
02:25:33,309 --> 02:25:35,870
How do I delete somebody else's character?

1974
02:25:35,870 --> 02:25:36,670
You know what I mean?

1975
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,149
Seriously.

1976
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,520
All right.

1977
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,639
Let's add dog.

1978
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:47,239
What kind of breed?

1979
02:25:50,299 --> 02:25:55,930
Uh, no, we're not making an auto.

1980
02:25:55,930 --> 02:26:14,090
Let's make a little, a little fucked up on the face.

1981
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:14,569
That's fine.

1982
02:26:20,569 --> 02:26:21,850
Extra large nose.

1983
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:25,209
This is the Budweiser dog.

1984
02:26:25,209 --> 02:26:36,159
Yeah, that looks good.

1985
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:43,389
It's a giant rat.

1986
02:26:43,389 --> 02:26:44,030
Mm-hmm.

1987
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:48,120
It's a giant rat.

1988
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:48,760
Perfect.

1989
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:51,520
What about the tail here?

1990
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,799
You can change the tail.

1991
02:26:52,799 --> 02:26:55,040
No, rat tails are thin.

1992
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:03,440
Little legs if I can make them smaller.

1993
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:10,090
Let's go in detail mode here.

1994
02:27:10,649 --> 02:27:15,579
Can I make these any bigger?

1995
02:27:15,579 --> 02:27:36,200
No, it just looks like a bird.

1996
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,000
A duck.

1997
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:43,760
Eyes all the way back.

1998
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:44,639
It's a rat.

1999
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:55,420
It does look sad.

2000
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:56,299
Yeah, I gotta make it...

2001
02:27:56,299 --> 02:27:57,659
I gotta make the dog not sad.

2002
02:27:57,659 --> 02:27:58,620
The rat, whatever.

2003
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:09,920
It just always looks sad.

2004
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:10,239
Why?

2005
02:28:13,850 --> 02:28:15,049
Why do you look sad?

2006
02:28:15,049 --> 02:28:30,920
Let me go make the body bigger.

2007
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:43,739
That's so creepy looking.

2008
02:28:43,739 --> 02:28:44,299
Okay.

2009
02:28:44,299 --> 02:28:46,090
I think that's good.

2010
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:51,360
I think it's a mouth that's doing it.

2011
02:28:51,360 --> 02:29:05,309
How big are rat's ears?

2012
02:29:05,309 --> 02:29:06,920
Are they huge?

2013
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:08,600
They're big, right?

2014
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,399
No, they're tiny.

2015
02:29:09,399 --> 02:29:10,200
How big are they?

2016
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:22,989
They're like that.

2017
02:29:22,989 --> 02:29:23,709
They're massive.

2018
02:29:23,709 --> 02:29:24,989
Let me say rat.

2019
02:29:24,989 --> 02:29:28,750
Yeah, they're a little tiny.

2020
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:29,790
They look like this.

2021
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:36,120
Okay, here we go.

2022
02:29:37,719 --> 02:29:41,840
Now we need to have a coat here.

2023
02:29:42,399 --> 02:29:49,520
I think I can just do fur, right?

2024
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,559
Here we go.

2025
02:29:53,559 --> 02:29:59,639
Here we go.

2026
02:29:59,639 --> 02:30:00,920
That's kind of rat-like.

2027
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:06,639
That's pretty close.

2028
02:30:06,639 --> 02:30:13,129
That's better.

2029
02:30:13,129 --> 02:30:13,770
That's better, yeah.

2030
02:30:13,770 --> 02:30:14,889
Paint the tail pink.

2031
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,840
Paint the tail and paws pink.

2032
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:20,190
That's a good idea.

2033
02:30:20,190 --> 02:30:35,739
All right, let's paint.

2034
02:30:35,739 --> 02:30:36,540
And the ears.

2035
02:30:39,389 --> 02:30:54,110
Damn it.

2036
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:55,229
That not so pink.

2037
02:30:55,229 --> 02:30:58,909
What do you mean not so pink?

2038
02:30:58,909 --> 02:31:00,590
Not Barbie pink?

2039
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:02,540
It's too dark.

2040
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:30,379
What?

2041
02:31:30,379 --> 02:31:31,579
Pale pink.

2042
02:31:31,579 --> 02:31:34,750
Well, who cares?

2043
02:31:35,309 --> 02:31:38,719
What?

2044
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:39,120
Salmon?

2045
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:39,920
That's like salmon.

2046
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,040
That's fresh salmon.

2047
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:48,809
Oh, it's never going to get fixed.

2048
02:31:48,809 --> 02:31:50,090
I have to do the whole thing again here.

2049
02:31:50,090 --> 02:32:03,790
Okay, that's better.

2050
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:06,399
Oh, who cares?

2051
02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:13,309
So let's go pink.

2052
02:32:13,309 --> 02:32:16,969
Is that better?

2053
02:32:16,969 --> 02:32:18,280
That's salmon.

2054
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:21,069
That's a salmon color.

2055
02:32:21,069 --> 02:32:32,489
He's done it.

2056
02:32:32,489 --> 02:32:33,610
He's finally done it.

2057
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:41,770
Now let's get the tail.

2058
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:50,270
What color are rat's feet?

2059
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:51,389
Also pink too, right?

2060
02:32:51,389 --> 02:33:03,229
Yeah, it's like the same color.

2061
02:33:03,229 --> 02:33:06,520
All right, roll over.

2062
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:11,000
I want to get the underside of your tail here.

2063
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:16,670
All right, you're good.

2064
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:30,889
Now let's get your paws disturbing.

2065
02:33:39,309 --> 02:33:51,639
That's how far it goes up, right?

2066
02:33:51,719 --> 02:33:52,760
It goes up a little further.

2067
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:56,120
I painted on it.

2068
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:56,840
It's like knees.

2069
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,799
I didn't mean to, but that's okay.

2070
02:33:59,799 --> 02:34:07,129
I'm gonna give you the eraser.

2071
02:34:07,129 --> 02:34:07,450
I'll get it.

2072
02:34:07,450 --> 02:34:11,920
I'll clean it up.

2073
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:15,600
Gloves there.

2074
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,559
Perfect.

2075
02:34:16,559 --> 02:34:17,440
All right, stand up.

2076
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:32,319
Let's get a good look at you.

2077
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:34,479
That's just a quick little reference

2078
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:35,840
to people that saw the last one.

2079
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:44,399
Okay, let's draw whiskers.

2080
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:51,639
Kind of already done for us here.

2081
02:34:51,639 --> 02:34:56,079
Now I can do them myself.

2082
02:34:56,079 --> 02:34:57,120
Thank you very much.

2083
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:00,620
Which way do they go?

2084
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:01,100
Out?

2085
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:15,479
How do they look?

2086
02:35:15,479 --> 02:35:20,110
Wrapped face.

2087
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:20,670
No, they're only...

2088
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:23,440
The nose is pink too.

2089
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:30,379
Here, stand up straight.

2090
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:33,469
Let me see that nose.

2091
02:35:33,709 --> 02:35:36,079
I can't do the nose.

2092
02:35:36,079 --> 02:35:38,079
Nose is unpaintable.

2093
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:47,950
Guys, sorry.

2094
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:50,729
Maybe I could do it on the nose option.

2095
02:35:50,729 --> 02:35:52,489
All right, let's give them whiskers first.

2096
02:35:52,489 --> 02:36:01,290
They gotta be smaller than that.

2097
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:06,829
And they gotta be clear, gray.

2098
02:36:06,829 --> 02:36:23,420
All right, let's go to the nose.

2099
02:36:27,049 --> 02:36:30,409
Tails, body, fur, pet clothing.

2100
02:36:30,409 --> 02:36:34,799
And I do nose.

2101
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:38,989
Body, breeds, tails.

2102
02:36:38,989 --> 02:36:40,280
How do I get to it?

2103
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:51,639
Just click on his nose.

2104
02:36:51,639 --> 02:36:52,920
The eyes though, the eyes have to be...

2105
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:57,760
Yeah, there we go.

2106
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:08,120
Holy shit, that's pretty close.

2107
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:09,159
Get rid of the whiskers.

2108
02:37:09,159 --> 02:37:10,760
The whiskers just fuck it all up.

2109
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:22,889
Oh no, I kind of missed them now.

2110
02:37:22,889 --> 02:37:23,930
Hold on, let me try again.

2111
02:37:23,930 --> 02:37:30,250
Let's go with like three.

2112
02:37:30,250 --> 02:37:46,889
What an even worse proximity.

2113
02:37:46,889 --> 02:37:56,729
That's like a cat though.

2114
02:37:56,729 --> 02:38:12,639
Get a little darker.

2115
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:13,360
Got it!

2116
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:22,829
All right.

2117
02:38:22,829 --> 02:38:26,159
Hello, my name is Giant Rat.

2118
02:38:26,159 --> 02:38:30,379
There you are.

2119
02:38:30,379 --> 02:38:35,850
Wait, there's a little bullshit mark right here.

2120
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:37,530
These paws need to be cleaned up a little bit.

2121
02:38:37,530 --> 02:38:39,049
I'm not gonna just have to suck.

2122
02:38:39,049 --> 02:38:51,309
Bigger brush.

2123
02:38:51,309 --> 02:38:56,719
I'm not just gonna have to suck, guys.

2124
02:38:56,719 --> 02:39:11,000
This is Giant Rat.

2125
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,120
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

2126
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:13,000
All right, there it is.

2127
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,360
Look at that avatar.

2128
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:15,319
It's perfect.

2129
02:39:15,319 --> 02:39:18,120
So this household is Vroomer...

2130
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:22,920
Jeremy Reinhardt.

2131
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:25,520
Vroomer Reinhardt.

2132
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,149
Giant Rat.

2133
02:39:29,149 --> 02:39:30,430
And let's go with another...

2134
02:39:30,430 --> 02:39:30,989
I'm just gonna...

2135
02:39:30,989 --> 02:39:32,590
I'm gonna see what I can do here.

2136
02:39:32,590 --> 02:39:33,520
I'm gonna make...

2137
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:35,360
We'll find out.

2138
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:43,159
Here we go.

2139
02:39:43,159 --> 02:39:44,120
Clear everything.

2140
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:47,760
Clear hair.

2141
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:49,760
All hair.

2142
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,399
All right, all right.

2143
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:51,360
Let's start.

2144
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:54,719
Start with the nose first.

2145
02:39:54,719 --> 02:40:02,750
Let me out there.

2146
02:40:03,309 --> 02:40:04,110
What do I grab?

2147
02:40:04,110 --> 02:40:05,149
I want to grab this.

2148
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:16,969
Okay, I have to make an elephant.

2149
02:40:24,329 --> 02:40:25,370
Come on now.

2150
02:40:25,370 --> 02:40:31,579
Let me just grab in there.

2151
02:40:40,989 --> 02:40:42,750
You know you want to let me do this.

2152
02:40:42,750 --> 02:41:05,360
Come on.

2153
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:06,159
Nice.

2154
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:17,579
Elephant.

2155
02:41:17,579 --> 02:41:24,639
Bring it in.

2156
02:41:24,639 --> 02:41:31,020
Looking good so far.

2157
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:32,780
I like the kind of Dumbo eyes.

2158
02:41:37,659 --> 02:41:38,459
Fuck.

2159
02:41:38,459 --> 02:41:54,959
Okay.

2160
02:41:54,959 --> 02:42:03,979
How much further down can that go?

2161
02:42:03,979 --> 02:42:07,309
I think that's as far as it can go.

2162
02:42:07,309 --> 02:42:13,559
Unless I can...

2163
02:42:13,559 --> 02:42:15,000
No, that's perfect right there.

2164
02:42:15,639 --> 02:42:21,159
Wait a minute.

2165
02:42:21,159 --> 02:42:21,719
No, fuck it.

2166
02:42:21,719 --> 02:42:22,840
I'm making a goddamn bird.

2167
02:42:23,559 --> 02:42:24,520
This is a bird.

2168
02:42:24,520 --> 02:42:25,000
This is big.

2169
02:42:25,559 --> 02:42:32,809
It's like a pelican.

2170
02:42:32,809 --> 02:42:48,799
I need to make this mouth much smaller.

2171
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:54,760
This is just...

2172
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:56,040
I'm making the seagull.

2173
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:57,340
Here.

2174
02:42:57,340 --> 02:42:58,059
Saved forever.

2175
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:37,520
Well, never mind.

2176
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:38,639
It's a faucet.

2177
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:50,889
Delete this.

2178
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:54,110
No, it's staying.

2179
02:43:54,110 --> 02:44:16,920
This is terrifying.

2180
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:18,120
Make the eyes red.

2181
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:35,850
This needs to come up.

2182
02:44:35,850 --> 02:44:50,030
It's better.

2183
02:44:50,030 --> 02:45:01,309
I need to get that mouth much smaller.

2184
02:45:01,309 --> 02:45:08,239
Maybe actually...

2185
02:45:08,239 --> 02:45:09,120
Hold on.

2186
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,100
Bring this back up a little.

2187
02:45:11,100 --> 02:45:15,920
Wait.

2188
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,719
That's good.

2189
02:45:16,719 --> 02:45:50,299
Okay.

2190
02:45:50,860 --> 02:45:55,399
That's a pretty good elephant.

2191
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:06,000
Just got to do the ears.

2192
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:18,479
Oh, easy.

2193
02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:26,989
No, I got to go bigger than that.

2194
02:46:26,989 --> 02:46:28,270
They can't go bigger than that.

2195
02:46:28,350 --> 02:46:41,709
I don't know why there's an elephant living in this house.

2196
02:46:41,709 --> 02:46:43,709
Please kill this one right away.

2197
02:46:43,709 --> 02:46:46,510
Oh, I must just throw up.

2198
02:46:46,510 --> 02:46:50,409
This stream hadn't even gotten started yet, guys.

2199
02:46:50,409 --> 02:46:54,360
Do you guys understand?

2200
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:55,719
We haven't even begun.

2201
02:46:55,719 --> 02:47:04,799
I wonder, is the...

2202
02:47:06,379 --> 02:47:09,100
I mean, elephants' heads are fucking huge.

2203
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:10,379
They are huge.

2204
02:47:10,379 --> 02:47:11,450
But that's just...

2205
02:47:12,489 --> 02:47:13,290
It doesn't look right.

2206
02:47:13,290 --> 02:47:14,010
It looks strange.

2207
02:47:14,649 --> 02:47:22,969
There's five and a half thousand people here for the pretty stream.

2208
02:47:22,969 --> 02:47:23,930
I'm welcome.

2209
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:24,809
Hope you're having a good time.

2210
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:27,049
We haven't even started the stream yet.

2211
02:47:27,049 --> 02:47:31,479
This looks like Stuart Little, somebody said.

2212
02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:37,229
That's better.

2213
02:47:37,229 --> 02:47:38,989
It can't be that ridiculously huge.

2214
02:47:39,709 --> 02:47:40,360
I need to get...

2215
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,840
See, when I go into detail mode, can I spin them?

2216
02:47:43,479 --> 02:47:44,200
All right, here we go.

2217
02:47:45,629 --> 02:47:46,270
Oh, come on.

2218
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:48,139
Don't do this to me.

2219
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,989
Better?

2220
02:47:58,989 --> 02:47:59,950
I think they're out more now.

2221
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:05,879
What elephants wear for clothes?

2222
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:09,079
Fixes eyes.

2223
02:48:09,079 --> 02:48:10,280
I don't know if I want to.

2224
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:13,360
I feel like I want it like this.

2225
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:14,079
For some reason.

2226
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:25,239
No, they're better out.

2227
02:48:25,239 --> 02:48:36,059
Oh, shit.

2228
02:48:36,059 --> 02:48:37,100
I fucked it all up.

2229
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:55,420
Here we go.

2230
02:48:55,420 --> 02:48:56,299
I like it like that.

2231
02:48:56,299 --> 02:48:57,020
I like it the way it is.

2232
02:48:57,579 --> 02:49:05,079
Let's go with...

2233
02:49:05,719 --> 02:49:08,920
Well, elephant doesn't wear clothes.

2234
02:49:08,920 --> 02:49:20,780
Can I make them go down on all fours?

2235
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:28,559
There's got to be a jokey feet, right?

2236
02:49:28,559 --> 02:49:34,590
Come on.

2237
02:49:34,590 --> 02:49:35,709
You got to have something strange,

2238
02:49:35,709 --> 02:49:37,549
like a goofball outfit down here.

2239
02:49:37,549 --> 02:49:57,079
It's nothing at all.

2240
02:49:57,079 --> 02:49:58,969
I mean, you got clown shoes,

2241
02:49:58,969 --> 02:49:59,610
but you don't have...

2242
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:05,979
You got Pac-Man feet.

2243
02:50:05,979 --> 02:50:06,459
Wait, aren't...

2244
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:10,239
Don't elephants have pink feet?

2245
02:50:10,239 --> 02:50:14,200
They do, don't they?

2246
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:14,760
Yeah, they do.

2247
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:15,319
Elephants.

2248
02:50:15,319 --> 02:50:17,239
Elephant's feet.

2249
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:28,889
No, they don't.

2250
02:50:28,889 --> 02:50:30,489
They have like big dinosaur toes.

2251
02:50:31,129 --> 02:50:32,969
They have big dinosaur toenails.

2252
02:50:32,969 --> 02:50:49,799
Definitely going to make the ass bigger.

2253
02:50:49,799 --> 02:50:51,209
All right.

2254
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:52,250
No, they don't have that.

2255
02:50:53,049 --> 02:50:53,850
All right, that's fine.

2256
02:50:57,229 --> 02:50:58,750
Max's favorite of the household.

2257
02:51:01,549 --> 02:51:02,110
What?

2258
02:51:02,110 --> 02:51:11,530
Fruit don't wear clothes either.

2259
02:51:11,530 --> 02:51:11,850
Uh-huh.

2260
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:16,399
But yeah, I guess that's better.

2261
02:51:16,399 --> 02:51:18,879
Okay, I'm all right with that.

2262
02:51:18,879 --> 02:51:20,440
And you want to...

2263
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:22,200
Because they have like three toes.

2264
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:23,399
So look, it's like one, two...

2265
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,280
That's like a heel.

2266
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:26,840
You know what I mean?

2267
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:28,040
That's just pretend that's what it is.

2268
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:35,719
Fine, I'll give you a t-shirt.

2269
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:42,920
Yuck.

2270
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:51,680
No, that just looks like a Saturday morning

2271
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,799
kid's cartoon character.

2272
02:51:53,440 --> 02:51:53,840
Perfect.

2273
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:56,399
All right, he's an animal.

2274
02:51:56,959 --> 02:51:58,719
So friend to the animals.

2275
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:03,739
What's the...

2276
02:52:06,399 --> 02:52:16,219
Elephants are like sad, skittish, right?

2277
02:52:16,219 --> 02:52:16,940
They eat a lot.

2278
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:27,209
Are they vegetarians?

2279
02:52:27,209 --> 02:52:28,010
Yeah, they never forget.

2280
02:52:31,069 --> 02:52:40,829
Dance machine, insider, jealous, loner, hates children, outgoing, a bro.

2281
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:46,399
Make the elephant a painter.

2282
02:52:47,129 --> 02:52:48,010
A bookworm.

2283
02:52:48,010 --> 02:52:49,129
Okay, a little bookworm.

2284
02:52:51,309 --> 02:52:52,190
Needs a lot of food.

2285
02:52:53,149 --> 02:52:54,270
Uh, no, not a gloomy.

2286
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:54,590
We'll do...

2287
02:52:55,549 --> 02:53:07,399
Vegetarian, bookworm, and like loves children, right?

2288
02:53:11,450 --> 02:53:11,770
Or...

2289
02:53:12,489 --> 02:53:14,430
What should the last one be?

2290
02:53:15,229 --> 02:53:17,389
No, no, not hates children.

2291
02:53:17,950 --> 02:53:25,770
Where...

2292
02:53:25,770 --> 02:53:31,120
No, just hates children.

2293
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:36,969
Just make them...

2294
02:53:36,969 --> 02:53:37,850
Make it smart, okay.

2295
02:53:39,239 --> 02:53:40,360
Loves to hate children.

2296
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:41,559
All right, is this house ready to go?

2297
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:43,579
I think we're ready to go.

2298
02:53:43,579 --> 02:53:44,940
We've got all our dickheads.

2299
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:47,530
I need one more animal.

2300
02:53:47,530 --> 02:53:48,329
One more animal.

2301
02:53:48,329 --> 02:53:50,540
Final animal.

2302
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:51,340
Cat.

2303
02:53:51,340 --> 02:54:03,319
All right, bolognese.

2304
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:04,600
What's ba...

2305
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:05,799
Uh, how do I pick breed?

2306
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:16,829
No, breed.

2307
02:54:16,829 --> 02:54:17,629
Head shape.

2308
02:54:17,629 --> 02:54:18,030
Where is it?

2309
02:54:18,889 --> 02:54:19,770
All right, I just missed it.

2310
02:54:20,649 --> 02:54:21,290
Get deleted.

2311
02:54:22,010 --> 02:54:28,040
All right, hold on.

2312
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:28,440
Let's have...

2313
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:29,639
Breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.

2314
02:54:29,639 --> 02:54:35,600
I want a cat with a very, very small head.

2315
02:54:48,190 --> 02:54:49,629
Like a big ass neck.

2316
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:54,200
Mm-mm.

2317
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:55,479
Oh, boy.

2318
02:54:55,479 --> 02:54:57,819
All right, I'm gonna...

2319
02:54:57,819 --> 02:54:59,819
Should I make one of the human skin cats?

2320
02:54:59,819 --> 02:55:21,120
Let's get in there.

2321
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:43,100
No, I don't want you to be like eyes crossed.

2322
02:55:43,659 --> 02:56:04,440
I'm turning this cat into a dog.

2323
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:06,170
It's just a dog.

2324
02:56:06,170 --> 02:56:06,489
Not...

2325
02:56:06,489 --> 02:56:07,450
Hold on, not yet.

2326
02:56:07,450 --> 02:56:14,200
I like that, though.

2327
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:25,020
Yeah, big, thick neck.

2328
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:32,680
Now, you guys...

2329
02:56:32,680 --> 02:56:33,559
I don't think you guys got it right.

2330
02:56:33,559 --> 02:56:35,559
This is the statue gargoyle things

2331
02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:47,180
from the first Ghostbusters movie.

2332
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:48,379
How big is this thing?

2333
02:56:48,379 --> 02:56:55,500
Tail...

2334
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:56,459
Tail big.

2335
02:56:56,459 --> 02:57:00,840
All right, looking good.

2336
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:03,559
That's good.

2337
02:57:03,559 --> 02:57:04,680
A little bit bigger.

2338
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,200
Make the neck a little longer.

2339
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:14,190
Oh, I didn't do...

2340
02:57:14,190 --> 02:57:14,989
Uh...

2341
02:57:14,989 --> 02:57:16,010
Fluffy.

2342
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:16,489
No.

2343
02:57:16,489 --> 02:57:17,610
Select traits.

2344
02:57:17,610 --> 02:57:18,959
Custodious.

2345
02:57:21,610 --> 02:57:22,409
Territorial.

2346
02:57:24,030 --> 02:57:24,829
Wow.

2347
02:57:24,829 --> 02:57:25,229
Okay.

2348
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:29,399
And a prowler.

2349
02:57:29,399 --> 02:57:30,200
This is...

2350
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:31,000
This thing's scaring me.

2351
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:31,719
I don't like this.

2352
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:50,680
You're wearing, like, a Dragon Ball Z t-shirt?

2353
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:51,479
What the fuck is this?

2354
02:57:57,209 --> 02:57:57,770
No.

2355
02:57:57,770 --> 02:57:58,489
Get that off.

2356
02:57:58,489 --> 02:58:11,479
Don't let...

2357
02:58:11,479 --> 02:58:12,120
I hate it.

2358
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:26,940
Let's go over here.

2359
02:58:29,549 --> 02:58:30,430
Oh, let's see.

2360
02:58:37,709 --> 02:58:38,510
You like fire?

2361
02:58:38,510 --> 02:58:39,309
Like flames?

2362
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:42,360
Would flames work on the cat?

2363
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:42,920
Like a car?

2364
02:58:42,920 --> 02:58:43,879
Like a fast car?

2365
02:58:43,879 --> 02:58:54,639
It's not the right color.

2366
02:58:54,639 --> 02:59:01,399
I need a good, like, fire.

2367
02:59:01,399 --> 02:59:02,040
Here we go.

2368
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:16,620
This is like feathers.

2369
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:17,579
No, I don't like it.

2370
02:59:17,579 --> 02:59:19,280
This might be better.

2371
02:59:19,280 --> 02:59:22,600
That's a little better.

2372
02:59:22,600 --> 02:59:23,100
No.

2373
02:59:27,719 --> 02:59:33,899
Somebody put paint on a cat.

2374
02:59:33,899 --> 02:59:39,260
Oh, wait.

2375
02:59:39,260 --> 02:59:39,819
Fire.

2376
02:59:39,819 --> 02:59:41,000
Come on.

2377
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:41,879
Ooh.

2378
02:59:41,879 --> 02:59:42,600
Fire?

2379
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:57,440
Quite.

2380
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:57,840
No.

2381
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:09,659
It's a prehistoric cat.

2382
03:00:09,659 --> 03:00:12,829
It's like stone.

2383
03:00:12,829 --> 03:00:17,760
You guys have seen the Fantastic Four?

2384
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:20,440
You know that character, The Thing?

2385
03:00:20,440 --> 03:01:01,530
It's like a rock.

2386
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:03,979
The cat is...

2387
03:01:03,979 --> 03:01:05,899
It's not tire marks.

2388
03:01:05,899 --> 03:01:07,340
It's not tire marks.

2389
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:08,620
I'm gonna make that clear.

2390
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:16,219
Dammit.

2391
03:01:16,219 --> 03:01:17,579
Now I have to get rid of these.

2392
03:01:17,579 --> 03:01:26,510
That's so fucking awful.

2393
03:01:26,510 --> 03:01:38,559
I'm not gonna have...

2394
03:01:38,559 --> 03:01:41,049
It is Rumors Cat.

2395
03:01:41,049 --> 03:01:51,600
Ugh.

2396
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:53,120
No, that's too dark.

2397
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:54,399
This is too dark.

2398
03:01:54,399 --> 03:02:16,350
This is too dark.

2399
03:02:16,350 --> 03:02:21,920
I don't know if I can do this.

2400
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:26,159
Ugh.

2401
03:02:26,159 --> 03:02:26,799
No.

2402
03:02:26,799 --> 03:02:31,260
Poor cat.

2403
03:02:31,260 --> 03:02:32,219
No, I can't.

2404
03:02:32,219 --> 03:02:33,739
That's too terrible.

2405
03:02:33,739 --> 03:02:34,139
I...

2406
03:02:34,139 --> 03:02:40,159
Ugh.

2407
03:02:40,159 --> 03:02:42,280
No, that's awful.

2408
03:02:42,280 --> 03:02:45,559
Ugh.

2409
03:02:45,559 --> 03:02:48,520
This is just the shit in the ass all over again from last time.

2410
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:54,590
All right.

2411
03:02:54,590 --> 03:02:56,600
What if the cat didn't get run over?

2412
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:57,879
But it's just...

2413
03:02:57,879 --> 03:03:03,389
It's Rumors Cat.

2414
03:03:03,389 --> 03:03:10,280
So he has a certain tattoo.

2415
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:11,899
That's worse.

2416
03:03:11,899 --> 03:03:12,940
It's not worse.

2417
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:16,139
He's trying to justify it.

2418
03:03:16,139 --> 03:03:19,340
No, I'm trying to correct my wrong ways.

2419
03:03:19,340 --> 03:03:28,379
It looks too sad.

2420
03:03:28,379 --> 03:03:28,780
I can't.

2421
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:42,479
It's just a rash.

2422
03:03:42,479 --> 03:03:46,600
Vertical tire marks.

2423
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:50,760
He ran over the whole cat's whole body.

2424
03:03:50,760 --> 03:04:03,639
This is terrible.

2425
03:04:03,639 --> 03:04:04,360
That's worse.

2426
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:05,239
It's worse.

2427
03:04:05,239 --> 03:04:08,959
I hate this.

2428
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:11,840
I hate this, but it's a tattoo.

2429
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:16,879
Just delete it all.

2430
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:29,629
We're done.

2431
03:04:29,629 --> 03:04:31,709
Sim5 doesn't even have a name.

2432
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:37,239
Ugh.

2433
03:04:37,239 --> 03:04:38,760
I don't even know what to call it.

2434
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:43,229
This cat.

2435
03:04:43,229 --> 03:04:46,299
About nine...

2436
03:04:46,299 --> 03:04:47,100
Uh.

2437
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:51,260
No, I'm not gonna have it roadkill.

2438
03:04:51,260 --> 03:04:51,739
We...

2439
03:04:51,739 --> 03:04:55,159
I've removed the tire marks.

2440
03:04:55,159 --> 03:04:56,200
Not speed bump.

2441
03:04:56,200 --> 03:05:00,000
You guys are fucking awful.

2442
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,440
You guys are terrible.

2443
03:05:03,579 --> 03:05:05,020
Eight lives.

2444
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:08,079
Holy shit, you guys are awful.

2445
03:05:08,079 --> 03:05:22,270
Here's the new...

2446
03:05:22,270 --> 03:05:23,709
This is the last family.

2447
03:05:23,709 --> 03:05:24,430
Move them in.

2448
03:05:28,399 --> 03:05:30,440
Carfield.

2449
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:31,639
There they are.

2450
03:05:31,639 --> 03:05:33,000
This part doesn't even have a name.

2451
03:05:33,559 --> 03:05:34,639
Fuck this guy.

2452
03:05:34,639 --> 03:05:35,040
Who cares?

2453
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:35,840
What's this guy's name?

2454
03:05:38,360 --> 03:05:39,000
An elephant.

2455
03:05:44,569 --> 03:05:57,739
How's that for a name?

2456
03:05:57,739 --> 03:06:10,360
You ready?

2457
03:06:10,360 --> 03:06:12,040
Oh, the rat needs traits.

2458
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:15,149
A junta.

2459
03:06:15,149 --> 03:06:17,239
And friendly.

2460
03:06:17,239 --> 03:06:19,129
And a little bit stubborn.

2461
03:06:19,129 --> 03:06:19,690
A little...

2462
03:06:19,690 --> 03:06:21,760
Pretty vocal.

2463
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:22,399
Trouble maker.

2464
03:06:22,399 --> 03:06:23,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2465
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:23,520
Trouble...

2466
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:24,079
Okay.

2467
03:06:24,159 --> 03:06:27,799
We need trouble maker.

2468
03:06:27,799 --> 03:06:29,370
We need...

2469
03:06:29,370 --> 03:06:30,329
Not friendly.

2470
03:06:30,329 --> 03:06:35,899
A hunter.

2471
03:06:35,899 --> 03:06:36,620
Praying at night.

2472
03:06:36,620 --> 03:06:37,020
Stalking.

2473
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:38,139
Like hunting at night.

2474
03:06:38,139 --> 03:06:39,840
So we got...

2475
03:06:40,559 --> 03:06:41,440
Making trouble.

2476
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:41,920
Hunting.

2477
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:42,319
And then...

2478
03:06:43,579 --> 03:06:44,860
Uh, stubborn.

2479
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:46,379
We want no vocal because they sing.

2480
03:06:47,260 --> 03:06:55,450
You got traits, right?

2481
03:06:57,100 --> 03:06:57,739
Yes.

2482
03:06:57,739 --> 03:06:58,540
Everybody all set?

2483
03:06:59,260 --> 03:07:01,659
Are we ready to start playing the game?

2484
03:07:02,379 --> 03:07:06,489
I don't remember what we made.

2485
03:07:06,489 --> 03:07:06,729
All right.

2486
03:07:06,729 --> 03:07:07,770
I think we're good to go.

2487
03:07:08,409 --> 03:07:15,479
Here we go.

2488
03:07:15,479 --> 03:07:16,360
Welcome to the stream, guys.

2489
03:07:16,360 --> 03:07:18,040
It only took us about three and a half hours to set it up.

2490
03:07:18,909 --> 03:07:20,350
Change the animal voices, you got me?

2491
03:07:20,909 --> 03:07:24,860
How do I do that?

2492
03:07:41,159 --> 03:07:42,120
How do I change his voice?

2493
03:07:43,579 --> 03:07:44,219
Top left.

2494
03:07:44,219 --> 03:07:44,700
Dumbo.

2495
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:51,280
Tough.

2496
03:07:52,239 --> 03:07:53,020
Too low.

2497
03:07:53,979 --> 03:07:55,399
Deep.

2498
03:07:55,399 --> 03:08:04,479
Let's see if we can get a good one here.

2499
03:08:04,479 --> 03:08:05,120
How's it going?

2500
03:08:06,430 --> 03:08:06,750
Hey.

2501
03:08:07,389 --> 03:08:08,590
Hey, it's me, the giant rat.

2502
03:08:09,149 --> 03:08:11,760
Hey.

2503
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:14,120
It's pretty good.

2504
03:08:18,250 --> 03:08:19,049
I'm ready.

2505
03:08:19,049 --> 03:08:22,059
Oh, the cat needs it too.

2506
03:08:22,620 --> 03:08:34,649
This is a...

2507
03:08:34,649 --> 03:08:35,370
This is a bird?

2508
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:43,719
It's gonna stay like that.

2509
03:08:43,719 --> 03:08:48,909
My voice is fine.

2510
03:08:48,909 --> 03:08:49,389
All right.

2511
03:08:49,389 --> 03:08:50,750
Let's play the Sims.

2512
03:08:51,610 --> 03:08:52,329
Four.

2513
03:08:52,329 --> 03:09:03,479
Time to go.

2514
03:09:03,479 --> 03:09:05,319
We're gonna be saving frequently.

2515
03:09:05,319 --> 03:09:09,690
The tutorial just ended.

2516
03:09:09,690 --> 03:09:10,889
We need a place for them to move.

2517
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:26,200
I like this one.

2518
03:09:32,250 --> 03:09:33,049
That's perfect.

2519
03:09:33,049 --> 03:09:33,530
I like it.

2520
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:40,760
You look just scary in every single photo.

2521
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:43,420
New cool 3D world.

2522
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:49,020
So in here, we have the fruits, then Mr. Lobo.

2523
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:55,790
You've also got the Reinhardt family, and then the gnome.

2524
03:09:59,870 --> 03:10:00,430
So where...

2525
03:10:00,430 --> 03:10:01,709
I need three bedrooms?

2526
03:10:02,270 --> 03:10:05,899
28 grand.

2527
03:10:05,899 --> 03:10:06,620
Could go here.

2528
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:07,579
How many bedrooms are in here?

2529
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:08,719
Two.

2530
03:10:08,719 --> 03:10:10,879
This lives right next to the gnome.

2531
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:13,000
Two beds.

2532
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:13,559
Two beds.

2533
03:10:13,559 --> 03:10:14,920
I can throw another bed in there.

2534
03:10:14,920 --> 03:10:15,479
Who cares?

2535
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:22,040
This one's a little bigger.

2536
03:10:25,709 --> 03:10:27,629
You do not want to be next to the gnome.

2537
03:10:28,729 --> 03:10:29,450
No, I don't.

2538
03:10:29,450 --> 03:10:31,799
But I think it'll be okay.

2539
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:37,850
Take a pee break?

2540
03:10:38,879 --> 03:10:39,440
Yeah, all right.

2541
03:10:39,440 --> 03:10:40,399
You know, it's been three hours.

2542
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:41,200
I'm gonna grab a drink.

2543
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:46,620
We're going probably all night just to let you guys know.

2544
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:57,319
So go take a piss.

2545
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:02,319
I'm gonna grab a drink, and I'll see you guys for a probably

2546
03:11:02,319 --> 03:11:04,319
straight night that's gonna be for at least another four or five hours.

2547
03:11:04,959 --> 03:11:06,280
Be right back.

2548
03:11:06,280 --> 03:15:04,000
All right, let's get this show on the road.

2549
03:15:09,629 --> 03:15:15,840
Thank you for hanging out in the creation of the three or four families here.

2550
03:15:16,479 --> 03:15:18,030
All the mods are go.

2551
03:15:18,590 --> 03:15:24,780
Let's do it.

2552
03:15:24,780 --> 03:15:31,360
So who do we want to play with first?

2553
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,719
I need to save the game, first of all.

2554
03:15:41,479 --> 03:15:41,959
It begins.

2555
03:15:42,520 --> 03:15:52,379
Whoever's gonna die the fastest.

2556
03:15:52,379 --> 03:15:54,700
I think we have to start with the Reinhardts.

2557
03:15:54,700 --> 03:15:56,409
It makes the most sense.

2558
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:02,520
Reality can be whatever I want.

2559
03:16:05,639 --> 03:16:07,719
1,800 second slow vote.

2560
03:16:09,930 --> 03:16:10,889
Holy shit.

2561
03:16:11,530 --> 03:16:13,920
This is where we're going.

2562
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:15,440
I'm gonna put another bed in here.

2563
03:16:15,440 --> 03:16:19,520
It's a little small, but it needs TLC.

2564
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:20,639
Somebody said don't do that.

2565
03:16:20,639 --> 03:16:24,159
Lively neighbors that make sense because the drug-dealing gnome is over here.

2566
03:16:31,950 --> 03:16:32,350
Let's see.

2567
03:16:32,350 --> 03:16:32,989
What's in here?

2568
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:38,360
No, this place is too expensive.

2569
03:16:38,920 --> 03:16:43,079
I can't afford the pool.

2570
03:16:43,639 --> 03:16:45,370
What's in here?

2571
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:48,159
All right.

2572
03:16:48,159 --> 03:16:49,680
I didn't kill these people?

2573
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:50,479
No, I didn't save it.

2574
03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:51,680
Okay, this is a party place.

2575
03:16:52,319 --> 03:16:53,690
We'll go downstairs.

2576
03:16:54,250 --> 03:16:55,370
This is a quake zone.

2577
03:16:55,370 --> 03:16:56,010
What does that mean?

2578
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:56,729
Quake zone.

2579
03:17:00,159 --> 03:17:00,479
Oh, no.

2580
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:01,600
Okay, right, right, right.

2581
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:04,670
I'm gonna do this free real estate cheat thing.

2582
03:17:05,229 --> 03:17:07,079
I have to be in a game for that to happen though, right?

2583
03:17:15,360 --> 03:17:16,479
Not, I don't for this, do I?

2584
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:17,920
Didn't I try this last time?

2585
03:17:29,659 --> 03:17:30,299
All right, here we go.

2586
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:31,819
All right, let's do it.

2587
03:17:33,610 --> 03:17:37,850
Let's move downstairs underneath that, those people, those partiers.

2588
03:17:38,409 --> 03:17:42,440
Where was that over here?

2589
03:17:42,440 --> 03:17:45,020
All right, this two-bedroom, two-bath.

2590
03:17:46,489 --> 03:17:48,809
We live underneath the karaoke legends.

2591
03:17:51,819 --> 03:17:52,299
Move on in.

2592
03:17:54,829 --> 03:17:55,469
Fully furnished.

2593
03:17:55,469 --> 03:17:55,870
I'll take it.

2594
03:18:00,079 --> 03:18:01,120
Okay, we're gonna take it slow.

2595
03:18:02,940 --> 03:18:06,409
I am going to have two bedrooms with three people.

2596
03:18:06,409 --> 03:18:06,969
Yeah, that's fine.

2597
03:18:07,610 --> 03:18:11,260
All right, here we go.

2598
03:18:13,100 --> 03:18:14,299
Game starts now.

2599
03:18:18,620 --> 03:18:19,979
That is such a tiny dog.

2600
03:18:20,940 --> 03:18:21,420
What's wrong?

2601
03:18:21,979 --> 03:18:25,360
Acquired the comedy skill.

2602
03:18:25,360 --> 03:18:26,319
Didn't even have to do anything.

2603
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:28,799
We all go right for the TV.

2604
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:32,239
Get off the table.

2605
03:18:32,239 --> 03:18:32,959
Get off the table.

2606
03:18:35,229 --> 03:18:36,989
We all went immediately to the TV.

2607
03:18:37,709 --> 03:18:43,659
And so let's do my perspective.

2608
03:18:44,680 --> 03:18:48,559
I watch and think America's got talent.

2609
03:18:51,979 --> 03:18:52,940
Quick, run him over.

2610
03:18:53,659 --> 03:18:54,620
I'm not gonna do...

2611
03:18:54,620 --> 03:18:55,420
No.

2612
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:56,459
Why does it say first to die?

2613
03:18:56,459 --> 03:18:57,819
Oh, that's the person's name.

2614
03:18:59,659 --> 03:19:00,459
He's still at it.

2615
03:19:02,459 --> 03:19:03,920
Let's interact.

2616
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:06,959
Play with the laser pointer with the cat.

2617
03:19:10,280 --> 03:19:11,719
No, I'm not killing anybody yet.

2618
03:19:14,700 --> 03:19:15,180
Go get it.

2619
03:19:18,280 --> 03:19:19,719
That rat just doesn't shut up, huh?

2620
03:19:19,719 --> 03:19:24,059
No.

2621
03:19:24,059 --> 03:19:24,940
No car joke.

2622
03:19:24,940 --> 03:19:26,219
I'm not doing that yet.

2623
03:19:26,219 --> 03:19:27,739
We can't just go to a thousand.

2624
03:19:33,549 --> 03:19:34,030
Let's see.

2625
03:19:34,030 --> 03:19:34,670
What's going to do?

2626
03:19:36,430 --> 03:19:37,389
What's going to do with the cat?

2627
03:19:38,940 --> 03:19:39,420
Pick up.

2628
03:19:40,540 --> 03:19:41,420
You can pick up the cat.

2629
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:42,299
I could pick him up?

2630
03:19:49,610 --> 03:19:52,750
How do I get out?

2631
03:19:52,750 --> 03:19:53,549
I guess I can just do this.

2632
03:19:57,469 --> 03:19:59,879
All right, let's see.

2633
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:01,959
You can actually pick the cats up.

2634
03:20:01,959 --> 03:20:02,680
I didn't even know that.

2635
03:20:11,659 --> 03:20:11,979
Guys.

2636
03:20:17,370 --> 03:20:18,809
I can stalk the cat.

2637
03:20:19,690 --> 03:20:24,170
Why would I do that?

2638
03:20:24,170 --> 03:20:24,809
I'm not going to do that.

2639
03:20:25,530 --> 03:20:26,680
Here's the thing, though.

2640
03:20:28,600 --> 03:20:29,799
I can use...

2641
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:34,200
I can move around with the animals.

2642
03:20:35,959 --> 03:20:43,549
Remember this?

2643
03:20:44,350 --> 03:20:46,760
I'm going to be nice to the cat.

2644
03:20:46,760 --> 03:20:48,040
Look, I'm holding the cat and hit no.

2645
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:49,079
Okay, now just get picked up.

2646
03:20:52,090 --> 03:20:52,729
More choices.

2647
03:20:52,729 --> 03:20:53,930
We got drugs.

2648
03:20:56,569 --> 03:21:00,670
Not doing these yet, but I can't control the animals.

2649
03:21:01,309 --> 03:21:05,319
Yeah, get a spot right on the sofa.

2650
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:10,520
Oh, also, we can't go right into this yet,

2651
03:21:10,520 --> 03:21:12,920
but any object of the whole game can be worn as a hat.

2652
03:21:13,959 --> 03:21:17,000
Just throwing that out there in case anybody was wondering.

2653
03:21:24,219 --> 03:21:25,260
Let's see here.

2654
03:21:25,260 --> 03:21:25,819
What was in here?

2655
03:21:27,719 --> 03:21:29,399
All right, can we do something as a group?

2656
03:21:35,659 --> 03:21:37,180
What do I want to do for them?

2657
03:21:37,180 --> 03:21:39,340
What do I want to actually do with the characters?

2658
03:21:39,340 --> 03:21:40,860
I got to make like a decision here.

2659
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:43,579
Pet obsessions.

2660
03:21:46,219 --> 03:21:46,940
Oh, we have...

2661
03:21:46,940 --> 03:21:47,659
Here we go, here we go.

2662
03:21:48,620 --> 03:21:50,639
Do they like cats?

2663
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:58,780
Welcome to the neighborhood.

2664
03:21:58,780 --> 03:21:59,979
The cat is about to greet them.

2665
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:11,520
Is that it?

2666
03:22:27,280 --> 03:22:28,000
No, no.

2667
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:29,280
Who is this lady?

2668
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:32,440
Whoa!

2669
03:22:35,399 --> 03:22:37,000
Oh, sorry, my little shit cat.

2670
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:37,959
My cat's an asshole.

2671
03:22:37,959 --> 03:22:38,840
Hold on.

2672
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:40,750
Come on in.

2673
03:22:40,750 --> 03:22:41,549
Let's have some fun.

2674
03:22:41,549 --> 03:22:42,030
Come on in.

2675
03:22:42,670 --> 03:22:43,229
Both of you.

2676
03:22:43,790 --> 03:22:48,399
They're relatively normal.

2677
03:22:48,959 --> 03:22:50,799
That's sort of.

2678
03:22:53,290 --> 03:22:54,170
What do you have in your hand?

2679
03:22:55,370 --> 03:22:56,809
Oh, I forgot that you like reading.

2680
03:22:57,690 --> 03:23:01,239
Can somebody get the door?

2681
03:23:01,879 --> 03:23:04,360
Somebody get the door.

2682
03:23:04,360 --> 03:23:05,959
You're just watching TV to get a stop.

2683
03:23:12,219 --> 03:23:15,370
She just looks like a fish.

2684
03:23:16,090 --> 03:23:17,530
Oh, you like red cars.

2685
03:23:17,530 --> 03:23:18,090
Do you?

2686
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:18,590
Uh-oh.

2687
03:23:23,370 --> 03:23:23,770
It's funny.

2688
03:23:23,770 --> 03:23:25,129
You say that you like red cars.

2689
03:23:31,290 --> 03:23:31,930
All right, hold on.

2690
03:23:31,930 --> 03:23:32,649
More choices.

2691
03:23:32,649 --> 03:23:33,149
Drugs.

2692
03:23:37,450 --> 03:23:38,329
This is the drug dealer.

2693
03:23:38,329 --> 03:23:39,690
I got to make friends with this guy.

2694
03:23:41,420 --> 03:23:43,100
We're getting some fucking drugs in this house.

2695
03:23:44,059 --> 03:23:44,860
I'll take care of this.

2696
03:23:45,979 --> 03:23:46,780
What, am I frayed?

2697
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:49,260
All right, go here.

2698
03:23:52,479 --> 03:23:53,200
Yeah, there's a gnome.

2699
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:55,920
Jeremy just became friends with the giant rat.

2700
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:56,479
Yes, we did.

2701
03:23:59,260 --> 03:23:59,979
All right, head out here.

2702
03:23:59,979 --> 03:24:01,100
I need to get like a good view of this.

2703
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:07,319
All right, greet new neighbor.

2704
03:24:10,120 --> 03:24:10,620
Benio.

2705
03:24:14,120 --> 03:24:15,319
Just as the prophecy.

2706
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:16,920
There you are.

2707
03:24:17,479 --> 03:24:18,600
Glad we got a chance to chat.

2708
03:24:19,639 --> 03:24:20,590
Yeah, you and I.

2709
03:24:21,709 --> 03:24:23,069
Impishly Pester.

2710
03:24:23,069 --> 03:24:24,270
Bye, weed.

2711
03:24:25,229 --> 03:24:26,590
Discuss current drug.

2712
03:24:26,590 --> 03:24:28,829
Hey, it's really nice to meet you.

2713
03:24:28,829 --> 03:24:29,790
It's really interesting.

2714
03:24:29,790 --> 03:24:31,549
By the way, what's the current drug market?

2715
03:24:31,549 --> 03:24:33,389
Brand new neighbor I haven't even said hello to.

2716
03:24:34,909 --> 03:24:37,549
Buy MDMA pills.

2717
03:24:37,549 --> 03:24:38,989
All right, we're going to buy MDMA.

2718
03:24:40,030 --> 03:24:40,670
Is this illegal?

2719
03:24:45,610 --> 03:24:46,969
Just in front of everybody.

2720
03:24:48,889 --> 03:24:49,530
Who the fuck are you?

2721
03:24:51,370 --> 03:24:52,409
Who is this person?

2722
03:24:53,209 --> 03:24:54,729
Where am I going?

2723
03:24:57,709 --> 03:24:58,750
Oh, you made scrambled eggs?

2724
03:24:59,389 --> 03:25:02,200
What am I doing?

2725
03:25:06,010 --> 03:25:07,770
Am I cooking the MDMA?

2726
03:25:08,729 --> 03:25:12,590
This just looks like VR chat.

2727
03:25:13,309 --> 03:25:18,590
I'm sure I haven't taken them already.

2728
03:25:18,590 --> 03:25:19,549
Did I take the drugs?

2729
03:25:20,799 --> 03:25:22,079
I'm going to go out the window?

2730
03:25:22,079 --> 03:25:29,239
No, no, not yet.

2731
03:25:29,239 --> 03:25:30,120
Not yet.

2732
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:30,760
That's illegal.

2733
03:25:35,979 --> 03:25:37,739
Oh, I'm cycling through people.

2734
03:25:37,739 --> 03:25:38,299
Okay, I get it.

2735
03:25:38,860 --> 03:25:47,079
How do I put this down?

2736
03:25:47,079 --> 03:25:53,799
What are we following?

2737
03:25:54,520 --> 03:25:56,860
All right, hold on a second.

2738
03:25:56,860 --> 03:25:57,819
Let me get back up here.

2739
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:05,840
I think it's because I'm eating.

2740
03:26:09,280 --> 03:26:09,600
Open.

2741
03:26:14,399 --> 03:26:15,040
Oh, shit.

2742
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:16,239
Okay, I have a lot of them here.

2743
03:26:16,879 --> 03:26:24,079
I got high quality pink disco biscuit.

2744
03:26:26,360 --> 03:26:28,040
Kick every party up.

2745
03:26:30,670 --> 03:26:32,750
No pet is truly fearless, even eight.

2746
03:26:32,750 --> 03:26:34,190
Each pet has its own unique fears.

2747
03:26:34,190 --> 03:26:34,670
What do you mean?

2748
03:26:34,670 --> 03:26:35,149
What's going on?

2749
03:26:38,030 --> 03:26:38,989
What are you afraid of?

2750
03:26:39,629 --> 03:26:42,030
He's just mashing controls and scaring my cat.

2751
03:26:43,290 --> 03:26:44,090
Can you cut the shit?

2752
03:26:44,729 --> 03:26:57,209
All right, let's put these back on the table here.

2753
03:26:59,770 --> 03:27:00,809
Uh, let's just take one.

2754
03:27:09,440 --> 03:27:09,920
He's in mine.

2755
03:27:09,920 --> 03:27:10,799
I'm the only one that's gonna take.

2756
03:27:14,040 --> 03:27:14,680
What does this do?

2757
03:27:30,239 --> 03:27:37,100
Well, I mean, you didn't even take drugs when you're in here.

2758
03:27:37,659 --> 03:27:40,940
Rumor is busting some moves.

2759
03:27:40,940 --> 03:27:42,379
He has unlocked some new dance moves

2760
03:27:42,379 --> 03:27:44,299
that can now show off the arm charm.

2761
03:27:44,940 --> 03:27:49,719
Let me teach you about a dance.

2762
03:27:51,440 --> 03:27:52,879
What the fuck is that move?

2763
03:28:09,229 --> 03:28:11,069
Well, then I can work for money.

2764
03:28:12,940 --> 03:28:13,819
Who's going to pay me?

2765
03:28:23,260 --> 03:28:25,600
Who's going to pay me though?

2766
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:26,639
That's what I'm curious about.

2767
03:28:27,440 --> 03:28:28,719
Forget about teaching dancing.

2768
03:28:28,719 --> 03:28:29,840
I want to know who's going to pay.

2769
03:28:42,760 --> 03:28:43,959
That's not very good.

2770
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:48,200
The gnome just gave me 500 bucks.

2771
03:28:53,049 --> 03:28:53,690
What did you start with?

2772
03:28:53,690 --> 03:28:54,889
These like trading cards?

2773
03:28:59,530 --> 03:29:00,649
The life of a streamer.

2774
03:29:02,719 --> 03:29:04,079
Anybody have any donations?

2775
03:29:04,879 --> 03:29:05,440
Anybody?

2776
03:29:14,409 --> 03:29:15,129
Did I just dab?

2777
03:29:15,129 --> 03:29:16,010
Oh god, I dabbed.

2778
03:29:16,010 --> 03:29:17,209
Here, buy weed.

2779
03:29:17,770 --> 03:29:18,969
Buy a Ziploc bat.

2780
03:29:18,969 --> 03:29:20,329
Ask about drug quality.

2781
03:29:30,379 --> 03:29:32,059
No, no, no, that's...

2782
03:29:33,319 --> 03:29:35,079
I don't want to eat the whole bag of Doritos.

2783
03:29:35,639 --> 03:29:37,469
All right, stop this.

2784
03:29:38,110 --> 03:29:40,940
What do you think, chat?

2785
03:29:41,579 --> 03:29:48,729
I'm going to discuss the current drug market.

2786
03:29:49,290 --> 03:29:51,469
All right, stop twerking.

2787
03:29:57,850 --> 03:29:58,969
Nobody wants to eat the whole bag,

2788
03:29:58,969 --> 03:29:59,450
but everybody does.

2789
03:29:59,450 --> 03:30:00,010
That's what I'm saying.

2790
03:30:03,450 --> 03:30:05,290
If I dial this up to a thousand right now,

2791
03:30:05,290 --> 03:30:07,610
the whole stream is going to go just derail

2792
03:30:07,610 --> 03:30:08,409
and you know what happens.

2793
03:30:09,049 --> 03:30:10,159
Thanks for hanging out.

2794
03:30:10,159 --> 03:30:10,719
See you later.

2795
03:30:10,719 --> 03:30:12,399
Well, at least I got your phone number.

2796
03:30:12,399 --> 03:30:14,510
Is anybody else still in here?

2797
03:30:19,850 --> 03:30:20,569
Instagram?

2798
03:30:22,399 --> 03:30:23,040
Send?

2799
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:23,840
What else is here?

2800
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:26,440
Leash pet training.

2801
03:30:27,899 --> 03:30:28,860
Friendly pet care.

2802
03:30:31,209 --> 03:30:31,850
Give a bath.

2803
03:30:32,569 --> 03:30:41,069
I thought he was leaving.

2804
03:30:48,159 --> 03:30:49,440
More drugs than twerk.

2805
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:52,680
I'm supposed to be taking my dog out for a walk.

2806
03:31:01,420 --> 03:31:04,729
Oh, talk about the warm temperature.

2807
03:31:04,729 --> 03:31:05,850
Joke about politics.

2808
03:31:07,930 --> 03:31:08,729
Where am I going?

2809
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:12,569
Oh, it's time for a bath.

2810
03:31:13,209 --> 03:31:14,780
I know you're tired,

2811
03:31:14,780 --> 03:31:18,780
but it's time for you to get some clean bath time.

2812
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:23,600
What?

2813
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:25,420
Were you just trying...

2814
03:31:25,420 --> 03:31:26,059
Was he talking?

2815
03:31:26,620 --> 03:31:35,120
Where do you give the dog a bath?

2816
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:42,799
Do a rat cam?

2817
03:31:42,799 --> 03:31:43,120
Okay.

2818
03:32:00,280 --> 03:32:01,639
Look at how fucked up I look.

2819
03:32:02,360 --> 03:32:04,909
Did I just put my hand up and grab him?

2820
03:32:04,909 --> 03:32:06,110
I just like high-fived him.

2821
03:32:07,709 --> 03:32:08,510
Oh, that's my hand.

2822
03:32:09,629 --> 03:32:10,129
Okay.

2823
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:14,680
All right.

2824
03:32:14,680 --> 03:32:15,479
Thank you.

2825
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:16,120
I appreciate it.

2826
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:19,559
Oh, I'm shaking around.

2827
03:32:19,559 --> 03:32:20,440
The life of a dog.

2828
03:32:22,889 --> 03:32:23,450
What is he doing?

2829
03:32:37,360 --> 03:32:38,719
He's taking more drugs.

2830
03:32:40,319 --> 03:32:40,879
What do you...

2831
03:32:40,879 --> 03:32:41,760
Oh, I'm just gonna leave.

2832
03:32:43,209 --> 03:32:43,530
Bye.

2833
03:32:44,829 --> 03:32:45,790
No, don't just leave.

2834
03:32:45,790 --> 03:32:46,350
Go back.

2835
03:32:46,350 --> 03:32:46,750
Go back.

2836
03:32:46,750 --> 03:32:47,149
Go back.

2837
03:32:47,149 --> 03:32:47,870
Where are you going?

2838
03:32:48,750 --> 03:32:49,870
No, you don't just leave him.

2839
03:32:50,590 --> 03:32:53,420
I'm sick of this shit.

2840
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:57,979
Oh, he used to go outside.

2841
03:32:57,979 --> 03:32:58,700
He used to go outside.

2842
03:32:59,260 --> 03:33:02,239
Take your dog out.

2843
03:33:03,280 --> 03:33:06,170
I thought that was another animal in the house.

2844
03:33:06,969 --> 03:33:08,010
No, it's just one of my roommates.

2845
03:33:09,290 --> 03:33:10,170
No, he's still here.

2846
03:33:25,530 --> 03:33:26,649
I need to feed the dog.

2847
03:33:26,649 --> 03:33:28,010
I need to feed the animals.

2848
03:33:28,010 --> 03:33:28,409
Where are...

2849
03:33:28,409 --> 03:33:29,049
Where's the cat?

2850
03:33:30,840 --> 03:33:32,280
Oh, they're fighting for food now.

2851
03:33:32,280 --> 03:33:32,520
All right.

2852
03:33:32,520 --> 03:33:32,760
Hold on.

2853
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:33,719
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2854
03:33:40,110 --> 03:33:40,750
Pet talk.

2855
03:33:41,549 --> 03:33:45,979
Wait, wait, wait.

2856
03:33:46,540 --> 03:33:48,059
Where are they going?

2857
03:33:52,909 --> 03:33:54,510
Why are they out here by themselves?

2858
03:33:54,510 --> 03:34:00,250
I don't even know where he is.

2859
03:34:00,809 --> 03:34:08,059
He just went out on his own.

2860
03:34:14,520 --> 03:34:14,920
Okay.

2861
03:34:15,479 --> 03:34:18,700
Where's the cat?

2862
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:25,680
Who are...

2863
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:26,479
Oh, it's tomato.

2864
03:34:26,479 --> 03:34:26,799
It's the...

2865
03:34:26,799 --> 03:34:27,680
No, not tomato.

2866
03:34:27,680 --> 03:34:28,639
It's the apple.

2867
03:34:28,639 --> 03:34:32,170
This is the cat's point of view.

2868
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:41,659
Did I throw a knife around?

2869
03:34:47,420 --> 03:34:48,620
I didn't know how I got out here.

2870
03:34:50,010 --> 03:34:50,409
Trash.

2871
03:34:50,969 --> 03:34:52,319
Playing the trash.

2872
03:35:06,379 --> 03:35:07,100
What?

2873
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:08,139
The cat take drugs?

2874
03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:15,920
The cat's tripping up.

2875
03:35:16,559 --> 03:35:17,920
No, that's not good.

2876
03:35:17,920 --> 03:35:19,120
No, it's because I scrolled out.

2877
03:35:19,760 --> 03:35:26,090
Oh, I'm like just out here now.

2878
03:35:26,090 --> 03:35:53,579
Wait, why did they get so dirty?

2879
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:03,979
That's pee?

2880
03:36:03,979 --> 03:36:05,100
That's a shitload of pee.

2881
03:36:06,059 --> 03:36:12,329
No, he took a picture of himself.

2882
03:36:12,329 --> 03:36:18,440
What is tornadoes?

2883
03:36:22,760 --> 03:36:23,719
I've done that before.

2884
03:36:29,579 --> 03:36:30,620
I should really get going now.

2885
03:36:30,620 --> 03:36:31,180
See you later.

2886
03:36:31,180 --> 03:36:31,899
Well, okay.

2887
03:36:31,899 --> 03:36:33,180
How do I get the cat to come back?

2888
03:36:33,819 --> 03:36:36,879
Where's the cat?

2889
03:36:37,920 --> 03:36:41,129
Am I ordering food?

2890
03:36:41,850 --> 03:36:47,069
Wait a minute.

2891
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:56,239
Yibsbadeesh.

2892
03:36:56,239 --> 03:36:59,440
Barovay Senzin Dumbayakalo.

2893
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:04,120
I should be able to...

2894
03:37:04,120 --> 03:37:04,920
If this guy dies...

2895
03:37:06,280 --> 03:37:13,290
Can I just go in now?

2896
03:37:20,840 --> 03:37:21,799
That's how it is, bro.

2897
03:37:22,360 --> 03:37:22,920
Finally.

2898
03:37:34,350 --> 03:37:37,340
Finally.

2899
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:37,979
Finally.

2900
03:37:44,200 --> 03:37:46,600
You've been waiting all day for that.

2901
03:37:49,290 --> 03:37:50,170
Who's gonna run...

2902
03:37:50,170 --> 03:37:51,690
Who's gonna run the popcorn stand?

2903
03:37:54,170 --> 03:37:54,809
Go home.

2904
03:37:56,729 --> 03:37:57,530
I will feed you.

2905
03:38:00,540 --> 03:38:02,219
The music still is just blasting.

2906
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:04,250
All right.

2907
03:38:04,250 --> 03:38:04,649
Get up.

2908
03:38:05,899 --> 03:38:06,299
Claim.

2909
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:08,799
What do you mean claim?

2910
03:38:12,760 --> 03:38:13,799
Where's my window?

2911
03:38:15,530 --> 03:38:16,010
Skills?

2912
03:38:16,809 --> 03:38:18,329
No, where's my attitude?

2913
03:38:18,329 --> 03:38:18,969
Okay, there we go.

2914
03:38:19,899 --> 03:38:20,620
Join a club.

2915
03:38:21,520 --> 03:38:22,399
Own a business.

2916
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:24,920
Buy a vet clinic?

2917
03:38:24,920 --> 03:38:25,079
No.

2918
03:38:25,639 --> 03:38:26,520
All right.

2919
03:38:26,520 --> 03:38:27,559
My hunger, everything's fine.

2920
03:38:27,559 --> 03:38:28,280
My sleep is all right.

2921
03:38:28,280 --> 03:38:29,079
Let's speed it up a little.

2922
03:38:36,559 --> 03:38:36,799
Okay.

2923
03:38:38,319 --> 03:38:40,000
I need to get a pet bowl, first of all.

2924
03:38:41,739 --> 03:38:42,219
Finally.

2925
03:38:44,280 --> 03:38:45,000
That's so funny.

2926
03:38:46,479 --> 03:38:46,879
All right.

2927
03:38:46,879 --> 03:38:47,360
Pet bowl.

2928
03:38:54,700 --> 03:38:56,540
I'm gonna say it's probably...

2929
03:38:57,340 --> 03:39:00,409
It's like a pet option.

2930
03:39:01,290 --> 03:39:01,930
Kid's room.

2931
03:39:02,809 --> 03:39:03,530
Miscellaneous.

2932
03:39:05,469 --> 03:39:06,030
Kitchen.

2933
03:39:06,030 --> 03:39:06,750
I wonder what would it...

2934
03:39:06,750 --> 03:39:07,549
What would it be under?

2935
03:39:07,549 --> 03:39:08,270
I feel like a bowl.

2936
03:39:08,270 --> 03:39:08,989
Like a pet bowl.

2937
03:39:09,709 --> 03:39:15,770
It's like just pet.

2938
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:18,379
Pet food bowl.

2939
03:39:19,479 --> 03:39:20,200
Hey, look at that.

2940
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:20,600
All right.

2941
03:39:20,600 --> 03:39:21,559
Bow wow chow.

2942
03:39:23,100 --> 03:39:24,700
Let's get the automatic one.

2943
03:39:24,700 --> 03:39:32,840
How do I move it?

2944
03:39:32,840 --> 03:39:39,530
Let's hit the spin button.

2945
03:39:39,530 --> 03:39:39,850
Alt.

2946
03:39:40,409 --> 03:39:41,049
Control.

2947
03:39:41,049 --> 03:39:41,450
Shift.

2948
03:39:42,250 --> 03:39:42,569
Hold.

2949
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:47,840
How many of these do I need?

2950
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:48,399
Just two?

2951
03:39:50,760 --> 03:39:51,239
Pet mate.

2952
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:52,760
Just two of them.

2953
03:39:53,659 --> 03:39:54,620
Somebody said R.

2954
03:39:54,620 --> 03:39:55,500
I can't...

2955
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:56,299
R doesn't do anything.

2956
03:39:57,020 --> 03:39:59,790
Oh, there you go.

2957
03:40:05,530 --> 03:40:05,850
Okay.

2958
03:40:06,489 --> 03:40:07,870
So that's good.

2959
03:40:07,870 --> 03:40:08,190
Pet.

2960
03:40:08,190 --> 03:40:08,989
Pet toys.

2961
03:40:11,579 --> 03:40:12,139
Good to go.

2962
03:40:12,860 --> 03:40:14,559
Fill them up.

2963
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:15,600
Fill.

2964
03:40:16,559 --> 03:40:16,879
Fill.

2965
03:40:16,879 --> 03:40:17,680
They'd both be good.

2966
03:40:21,879 --> 03:40:22,920
I had to wake up for this,

2967
03:40:22,920 --> 03:40:23,959
but somebody had to do it.

2968
03:40:29,209 --> 03:40:30,969
Why is your sim more handsome than you?

2969
03:40:30,969 --> 03:40:31,770
It's unrealistic.

2970
03:40:32,409 --> 03:40:34,860
Ban that guy for five seconds, please.

2971
03:40:35,420 --> 03:40:38,590
All right.

2972
03:40:38,590 --> 03:40:39,469
What am I doing on this?

2973
03:40:39,469 --> 03:40:40,190
Is this a computer?

2974
03:40:40,190 --> 03:40:41,469
I thought this was like a toaster oven.

2975
03:40:42,860 --> 03:40:43,659
Write jokes.

2976
03:40:45,340 --> 03:40:46,219
Web order.

2977
03:40:48,120 --> 03:40:49,079
Purchase crackers.

2978
03:40:49,079 --> 03:40:49,799
Purchase medicine.

2979
03:40:49,799 --> 03:40:50,760
Purchase fireworks.

2980
03:40:53,129 --> 03:40:54,649
I can buy drugs on here?

2981
03:40:55,290 --> 03:41:03,069
Okay.

2982
03:41:03,069 --> 03:41:05,069
I'm buying drugs online.

2983
03:41:06,600 --> 03:41:07,799
Uninstall origin.

2984
03:41:09,790 --> 03:41:10,110
All right.

2985
03:41:13,479 --> 03:41:13,639
All right.

2986
03:41:13,639 --> 03:41:14,040
Here we go.

2987
03:41:16,479 --> 03:41:17,280
Vaporizer.

2988
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:18,959
Fill these packs.

2989
03:41:18,959 --> 03:41:19,840
Smoking papers.

2990
03:41:19,840 --> 03:41:20,399
Weed bung.

2991
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:22,239
That's all you got, huh?

2992
03:41:22,879 --> 03:41:24,360
I'll take one of each.

2993
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:31,930
You can stream with the Get Famous DLC.

2994
03:41:31,930 --> 03:41:33,850
Are the dogs and cats still outside?

2995
03:41:36,319 --> 03:41:37,200
You little shit.

2996
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:37,760
What are you doing?

2997
03:41:39,879 --> 03:41:40,440
Bladder.

2998
03:41:40,440 --> 03:41:41,799
Oh, how do you go to the bathroom?

2999
03:41:41,799 --> 03:41:43,000
Is it like a dog bathroom?

3000
03:41:43,639 --> 03:41:46,719
Oh, I got to walk them.

3001
03:41:46,719 --> 03:41:47,360
Get over here.

3002
03:41:52,319 --> 03:41:53,120
Request song.

3003
03:41:55,399 --> 03:41:55,959
No, no, no.

3004
03:41:57,319 --> 03:41:57,959
Go potty.

3005
03:41:59,760 --> 03:42:00,399
Walk the cat.

3006
03:42:00,399 --> 03:42:01,200
Get up.

3007
03:42:01,200 --> 03:42:01,680
Wake up.

3008
03:42:02,239 --> 03:42:04,409
Where's the cat?

3009
03:42:04,409 --> 03:42:05,370
You walk a cat?

3010
03:42:05,370 --> 03:42:05,770
No, you don't.

3011
03:42:05,770 --> 03:42:07,370
They have like a kitty litter.

3012
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:20,159
Like cat box.

3013
03:42:20,719 --> 03:42:21,520
Cat condo.

3014
03:42:21,520 --> 03:42:22,159
Cat wand.

3015
03:42:24,010 --> 03:42:24,809
Like glitter?

3016
03:42:29,149 --> 03:42:30,750
Littermatic scoop free.

3017
03:42:30,750 --> 03:42:31,229
Here we go.

3018
03:42:31,950 --> 03:42:33,020
There it is.

3019
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:34,059
$175.

3020
03:42:34,059 --> 03:42:34,780
Throw it over here.

3021
03:42:36,270 --> 03:42:37,069
Where can I put this?

3022
03:42:37,709 --> 03:42:43,209
There's a good place for this.

3023
03:42:43,770 --> 03:42:48,969
Let me go down a level.

3024
03:42:48,969 --> 03:42:50,750
There we go.

3025
03:42:50,750 --> 03:42:51,069
Okay.

3026
03:42:51,629 --> 03:43:04,969
All right.

3027
03:43:04,969 --> 03:43:05,770
That's good.

3028
03:43:05,770 --> 03:43:06,889
Cat can now go to the bathroom.

3029
03:43:06,889 --> 03:43:07,690
Take the dog out.

3030
03:43:08,809 --> 03:43:10,250
I was going to put it on the kitchen counter.

3031
03:43:10,250 --> 03:43:10,729
Yeah, you're right.

3032
03:43:14,110 --> 03:43:15,069
Take him outside.

3033
03:43:17,530 --> 03:43:18,889
Take the dog outside.

3034
03:43:18,889 --> 03:43:19,129
Now.

3035
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:23,360
Take dog outside.

3036
03:43:24,159 --> 03:43:29,120
What's going on up here?

3037
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:40,489
Wait, you can actually eat this?

3038
03:43:59,629 --> 03:44:00,829
Where am I?

3039
03:44:01,469 --> 03:44:04,190
And why have I not taken the dog out like I was supposed to?

3040
03:44:05,469 --> 03:44:06,909
Was I just eating out of the bowl?

3041
03:44:07,549 --> 03:44:11,370
Oh, you asshole.

3042
03:44:11,370 --> 03:44:11,850
Please.

3043
03:44:17,659 --> 03:44:18,219
Where's the dog?

3044
03:44:21,200 --> 03:44:22,239
What is that?

3045
03:44:22,879 --> 03:44:27,920
Did she knock over the bowl or something?

3046
03:44:29,799 --> 03:44:36,000
What is this?

3047
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:36,479
Is this?

3048
03:44:45,719 --> 03:44:46,120
All right.

3049
03:44:46,120 --> 03:44:47,239
Clean that up.

3050
03:44:47,239 --> 03:44:48,360
I thought it was...

3051
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:48,840
Mop it up.

3052
03:44:48,840 --> 03:44:49,959
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3053
03:44:49,959 --> 03:44:50,280
Stop it.

3054
03:44:50,280 --> 03:44:50,600
Stop it.

3055
03:44:50,600 --> 03:44:50,920
Stop it.

3056
03:44:50,920 --> 03:44:51,239
Stop it.

3057
03:44:51,239 --> 03:44:51,319
Stop it.

3058
03:44:51,319 --> 03:44:53,129
Stop it.

3059
03:44:53,129 --> 03:44:55,290
I thought she knocked the bowl of macaroni and cheese off.

3060
03:44:55,930 --> 03:45:04,440
Stop.

3061
03:45:06,159 --> 03:45:07,200
Now, please.

3062
03:45:07,200 --> 03:45:07,680
If you would.

3063
03:45:08,540 --> 03:45:15,229
Go for a walk.

3064
03:45:15,229 --> 03:45:15,629
Okay.

3065
03:45:15,629 --> 03:45:16,110
Finally.

3066
03:45:18,200 --> 03:45:19,639
Am I still fucked up from drugs?

3067
03:45:21,739 --> 03:45:22,540
Walk time.

3068
03:45:22,540 --> 03:45:23,020
Let's go.

3069
03:45:27,420 --> 03:45:28,059
Finally.

3070
03:45:28,059 --> 03:45:28,940
My god.

3071
03:45:31,579 --> 03:45:33,020
For a second, I thought I could drink up them.

3072
03:45:36,909 --> 03:45:37,790
All right.

3073
03:45:37,790 --> 03:45:39,229
Take dog for a walk.

3074
03:45:40,760 --> 03:45:45,399
Here we go.

3075
03:45:45,399 --> 03:45:45,959
What?

3076
03:45:45,959 --> 03:45:47,979
How did we...

3077
03:45:47,979 --> 03:45:48,940
We got out here really quick.

3078
03:45:49,760 --> 03:45:50,000
All right.

3079
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:50,399
Go pee.

3080
03:45:53,629 --> 03:45:55,209
We need a new cam.

3081
03:45:55,770 --> 03:46:29,000
Where'd it go?

3082
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:29,719
Where am I?

3083
03:46:29,719 --> 03:46:38,969
We didn't even get to see it?

3084
03:46:38,969 --> 03:46:47,819
He just deleted himself.

3085
03:46:47,819 --> 03:46:48,620
Okay.

3086
03:46:48,620 --> 03:47:06,170
I was hoping I could get a POV from the dog.

3087
03:47:06,170 --> 03:47:06,409
All right.

3088
03:47:06,409 --> 03:47:06,889
We were here.

3089
03:47:09,579 --> 03:47:09,819
Okay.

3090
03:47:09,819 --> 03:47:11,180
It's time to check on...

3091
03:47:11,180 --> 03:47:14,719
Let's check on the other families here.

3092
03:47:14,719 --> 03:47:19,149
The fruit apartment here.

3093
03:47:19,149 --> 03:47:21,229
Who gives a shit about any of these people?

3094
03:47:21,790 --> 03:47:24,760
I think it's time to start activating fucked up things.

3095
03:47:24,760 --> 03:47:36,299
What are you guys up to?

3096
03:47:36,860 --> 03:47:37,260
Let's see.

3097
03:47:37,979 --> 03:47:40,809
There's Mr. Banana.

3098
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:43,520
All right.

3099
03:47:43,520 --> 03:47:44,719
Go jogging.

3100
03:47:44,719 --> 03:47:45,200
Let's see.

3101
03:47:47,129 --> 03:47:47,850
Practice singing.

3102
03:47:48,649 --> 03:47:50,040
Mr. Apple.

3103
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:53,559
Specifically made these...

3104
03:47:53,559 --> 03:47:58,090
This family to just have horrible things happen to them.

3105
03:47:58,649 --> 03:48:05,290
So here's the thing about call over part gangs.

3106
03:48:06,920 --> 03:48:09,159
Enable the Thoughties gang outfit.

3107
03:48:10,360 --> 03:48:11,559
Join the Thoughties.

3108
03:48:12,280 --> 03:48:14,280
Join the Hardwood gang.

3109
03:48:14,280 --> 03:48:16,520
Invite the Thoughties gang to town.

3110
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:20,159
Invite the Hardwood gang to town.

3111
03:48:22,670 --> 03:48:24,590
This is probably going to be very bad.

3112
03:48:25,149 --> 03:48:29,469
Who the fuck are you?

3113
03:48:52,159 --> 03:48:53,200
Oh, it's the landlord.

3114
03:48:57,959 --> 03:49:15,040
It's so much worse in first person.

3115
03:49:18,079 --> 03:49:19,440
His apartment's up for rent.

3116
03:49:31,399 --> 03:49:32,120
What are you doing?

3117
03:49:41,959 --> 03:49:44,120
Oh, I forgot how fucking stupid this was.

3118
03:49:46,360 --> 03:49:48,200
I just slotted the landlord.

3119
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:50,040
We're gonna put butter and cheese in here.

3120
03:49:51,159 --> 03:49:51,719
Stir it up.

3121
03:50:03,239 --> 03:50:04,040
The singing.

3122
03:50:13,579 --> 03:50:15,899
Clearly you are a terrible and inconsiderate neighbor.

3123
03:50:15,899 --> 03:50:17,100
You just made a big mistake.

3124
03:50:17,100 --> 03:50:21,979
I will remember this.

3125
03:50:21,979 --> 03:50:23,340
What do you mean you're gonna remember this?

3126
03:50:26,840 --> 03:50:27,799
He's still alive?

3127
03:50:28,360 --> 03:50:40,120
How is it raining inside?

3128
03:50:53,069 --> 03:50:53,549
Gangs.

3129
03:50:54,829 --> 03:50:57,229
Let's add death to the Thoughties gang.

3130
03:50:58,190 --> 03:51:09,319
Okay, death is now a part...

3131
03:51:09,319 --> 03:51:11,319
Oh my god, shut the fuck up.

3132
03:51:43,290 --> 03:51:45,530
I see people like burning on the TV.

3133
03:51:58,829 --> 03:51:59,950
Alright, enough.

3134
03:52:00,829 --> 03:52:01,870
Enough, enough, enough.

3135
03:52:08,399 --> 03:52:09,920
Join the Thoughtie gang.

3136
03:52:12,079 --> 03:52:13,200
Jesus Christ.

3137
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:16,159
Oh god, wait, he's...

3138
03:52:16,159 --> 03:52:17,920
No, no, no, he's opening fire.

3139
03:52:19,440 --> 03:52:19,940
On who?

3140
03:52:23,040 --> 03:52:23,540
What?

3141
03:52:55,739 --> 03:52:56,940
Infinite ammo.

3142
03:53:00,059 --> 03:53:01,659
Did he kill everyone?

3143
03:53:03,799 --> 03:53:04,360
I've never...

3144
03:53:04,360 --> 03:53:05,719
That's a new addition.

3145
03:53:06,600 --> 03:53:12,459
I gotta restart it.

3146
03:53:12,459 --> 03:53:14,860
A police cruiser has just been dispatched to your location.

3147
03:53:16,139 --> 03:53:19,149
Who's alive?

3148
03:53:24,110 --> 03:53:25,469
Just like AOL.

3149
03:53:26,030 --> 03:53:45,610
What is death from above?

3150
03:53:46,409 --> 03:53:51,000
Death from above?

3151
03:53:54,600 --> 03:54:01,500
How did he die?

3152
03:54:03,260 --> 03:54:03,760
What?

3153
03:54:04,459 --> 03:54:06,299
Why are they coming in and shooting themselves?

3154
03:54:07,739 --> 03:54:18,329
Who's left?

3155
03:54:24,200 --> 03:54:24,840
Back to Reddit.

3156
03:54:41,420 --> 03:54:42,649
What do you mean, ow?

3157
03:54:43,370 --> 03:54:59,790
Let's reopen that.

3158
03:55:00,590 --> 03:55:05,469
Death coming in and twerking.

3159
03:55:06,110 --> 03:55:08,030
Because he was part of the Thoughties.

3160
03:55:08,030 --> 03:55:08,750
Alright, we gotta bring...

3161
03:55:08,750 --> 03:55:09,790
We gotta do a gang thing.

3162
03:55:10,350 --> 03:55:13,659
He typed in explode in the command, in the console command.

3163
03:55:15,879 --> 03:55:18,200
Alright, back in here, let's go.

3164
03:55:29,530 --> 03:55:34,030
Alright, new life here.

3165
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:39,879
We should go dancing or something.

3166
03:55:47,360 --> 03:55:48,879
No, drink energy juice.

3167
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:50,159
Go for it, yeah.

3168
03:55:50,719 --> 03:55:57,840
Also, important.

3169
03:55:58,719 --> 03:56:00,170
We may as well see what this does.

3170
03:56:00,889 --> 03:56:04,090
Let me go get it.

3171
03:56:06,250 --> 03:56:08,649
We have not even seen half of the mods that I have.

3172
03:56:08,649 --> 03:56:13,450
We have the genie lamp, which has a genie come out of a lamp and grant wishes.

3173
03:56:14,250 --> 03:56:19,709
We also have a scary horror mirror, so let's go get it.

3174
03:56:21,389 --> 03:56:21,790
Should be...

3175
03:56:21,790 --> 03:56:22,750
I think it's down here.

3176
03:56:23,469 --> 03:56:26,670
It's a lamp, let's try it.

3177
03:56:29,260 --> 03:56:29,739
Where is it?

3178
03:56:29,739 --> 03:56:31,020
Looking for the lamp.

3179
03:56:31,020 --> 03:56:34,250
It's like 10 grand or something, too.

3180
03:56:34,969 --> 03:56:35,770
It's ridiculous.

3181
03:56:37,420 --> 03:56:37,659
Where...

3182
03:56:37,659 --> 03:56:38,219
Here's the...

3183
03:56:38,219 --> 03:56:40,379
Okay, here is the haunted mirror.

3184
03:56:41,260 --> 03:56:45,260
Legend says that a bride was betrayed and murdered on her wedding day,

3185
03:56:45,260 --> 03:56:58,920
and this mirror was the last thing she saw herself before she died.

3186
03:56:58,920 --> 03:57:01,000
Join a club in the bottom right so you get tons of friends.

3187
03:57:02,799 --> 03:57:04,959
Yeah, right now I'm just going through what these things even do.

3188
03:57:10,239 --> 03:57:11,120
There's the haunted mirror.

3189
03:57:11,680 --> 03:57:14,430
Can you filter modded items?

3190
03:57:14,430 --> 03:57:16,030
Um, I'm not sure you can.

3191
03:57:16,030 --> 03:57:16,989
Maybe base work?

3192
03:57:18,190 --> 03:57:18,909
Spa day...

3193
03:57:20,590 --> 03:57:21,549
Nah, you can't.

3194
03:57:21,549 --> 03:57:23,709
Unless I can do it from a different content.

3195
03:57:23,709 --> 03:57:25,149
Let's see, purchase custom content.

3196
03:57:25,149 --> 03:57:25,549
There we go.

3197
03:57:26,110 --> 03:57:28,719
Here is the book of chaos.

3198
03:57:28,719 --> 03:57:31,120
Torture and chaos to those who are unworthy to live.

3199
03:57:31,920 --> 03:57:33,799
Put it down.

3200
03:57:34,440 --> 03:57:35,879
This is a speed package.

3201
03:57:35,879 --> 03:57:36,840
This is the weed bong.

3202
03:57:36,840 --> 03:57:37,959
Oh, who ordered all this?

3203
03:57:37,959 --> 03:57:38,840
Cocaine brick?

3204
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:42,120
Vintage baseball bat?

3205
03:57:45,290 --> 03:57:46,489
Baby laxatives?

3206
03:57:49,420 --> 03:57:50,379
And there's the genie lamp.

3207
03:57:50,379 --> 03:57:51,180
All right, so let's see.

3208
03:57:52,139 --> 03:57:52,540
I have a...

3209
03:57:52,540 --> 03:57:54,139
Let's just get him out here.

3210
03:57:58,409 --> 03:57:59,209
Rug can stay there.

3211
03:58:01,100 --> 03:58:07,239
And let's go back to live play and let's have the leopard gnome inspect the lamp.

3212
03:58:12,489 --> 03:58:13,049
Let's see what happens.

3213
03:58:22,010 --> 03:58:22,510
Okay.

3214
03:58:24,329 --> 03:58:24,889
So what happened?

3215
03:58:26,969 --> 03:58:28,409
I've rubbed the lamp, but what's going on?

3216
03:58:29,530 --> 03:58:30,250
Oh, shit.

3217
03:58:30,250 --> 03:58:30,750
Okay.

3218
03:58:31,930 --> 03:58:32,809
All right, here's the genie.

3219
03:58:35,360 --> 03:58:37,600
The genie just comes and just watches TV.

3220
03:58:37,600 --> 03:58:41,579
Where are my wishes?

3221
03:58:42,540 --> 03:58:43,979
I just added an NPC to the game.

3222
03:58:49,870 --> 03:58:50,829
Everybody rub the lamp.

3223
03:58:52,159 --> 03:58:54,639
Oh, no, only the leper gnome can now.

3224
03:58:57,280 --> 03:58:58,159
Do I get another genie?

3225
03:58:58,159 --> 03:58:59,040
How many genies do you get?

3226
03:59:04,600 --> 03:59:05,399
Just one genie?

3227
03:59:07,959 --> 03:59:09,079
All right, well, what can you do?

3228
03:59:09,879 --> 03:59:13,129
Friendly introduction.

3229
03:59:13,690 --> 03:59:18,670
Let's start a conversation.

3230
03:59:25,120 --> 03:59:25,620
How are you?

3231
03:59:27,940 --> 03:59:30,180
Have her join the thotties.

3232
03:59:30,180 --> 03:59:32,100
Not everybody has to join the thotties, okay?

3233
03:59:35,299 --> 03:59:36,500
Are we just meeting for the first time?

3234
03:59:42,180 --> 03:59:43,620
Reveal brilliant invention.

3235
03:59:44,340 --> 03:59:47,180
All right, let's flash our crazy eyes.

3236
03:59:52,479 --> 03:59:53,040
She liked it.

3237
03:59:56,399 --> 04:00:00,430
How about ask to hang out?

3238
04:00:04,590 --> 04:00:13,299
I wish this was VR.

3239
04:00:15,540 --> 04:00:19,600
Okay, so I'm getting some real interesting,

3240
04:00:19,600 --> 04:00:20,959
give fake news, ask to hang out,

3241
04:00:21,840 --> 04:00:23,149
asking about the day.

3242
04:00:29,889 --> 04:00:31,250
That's fucking mean.

3243
04:00:31,250 --> 04:00:32,450
Are you trying to make a friend

3244
04:00:32,450 --> 04:00:33,649
and potentially a romantic interest?

3245
04:00:33,649 --> 04:00:34,610
Are you trying to be an asshole?

3246
04:00:34,610 --> 04:00:35,409
What the hell was that?

3247
04:00:37,170 --> 04:00:44,260
Where are you going?

3248
04:00:44,260 --> 04:00:48,540
What are you doing?

3249
04:00:48,540 --> 04:00:49,979
Eat cereal.

3250
04:00:49,979 --> 04:00:55,059
Wow, that's next level.

3251
04:00:57,020 --> 04:00:58,219
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3252
04:00:58,219 --> 04:00:59,659
I'm going to eat some cereal.

3253
04:00:59,659 --> 04:01:01,340
I'm going to eat some lucky charms.

3254
04:01:02,139 --> 04:01:09,200
All right, can you keep talking?

3255
04:01:10,860 --> 04:01:12,780
All right, let's go with romance.

3256
04:01:13,760 --> 04:01:14,959
Make a flirtatious joke.

3257
04:01:15,680 --> 04:01:21,809
Talk about priorities.

3258
04:01:26,049 --> 04:01:27,700
This guy sucks.

3259
04:01:28,340 --> 04:01:35,549
All right, we got playful.

3260
04:01:35,549 --> 04:01:36,750
And with the bars on his folder,

3261
04:01:37,469 --> 04:01:38,350
by full I mean no.

3262
04:01:40,510 --> 04:01:41,469
Look at the lamp again.

3263
04:01:44,530 --> 04:01:45,329
Inspect the lamp.

3264
04:01:47,260 --> 04:01:48,459
This is his genie.

3265
04:01:48,459 --> 04:01:49,260
Inspect lamp.

3266
04:01:54,430 --> 04:01:55,469
Grandpa's gaming.

3267
04:01:57,549 --> 04:01:58,350
We're having a good time.

3268
04:01:58,750 --> 04:02:01,420
It's a lot of new love.

3269
04:02:01,420 --> 04:02:02,299
The lamp is so dusty,

3270
04:02:02,299 --> 04:02:03,260
I should probably rub it out.

3271
04:02:03,819 --> 04:02:04,379
Oh, God.

3272
04:02:05,180 --> 04:02:11,760
The plum looks like a genie.

3273
04:02:11,760 --> 04:02:17,200
She's following me around.

3274
04:02:17,760 --> 04:02:19,420
I think I made a friend.

3275
04:02:19,420 --> 04:02:20,700
How long does the genie stick around for?

3276
04:02:21,500 --> 04:02:28,079
The genie is going to make the same

3277
04:02:28,639 --> 04:02:30,159
eggs, cheese, and flour dinner.

3278
04:02:30,799 --> 04:02:33,420
All right, more choices.

3279
04:02:35,090 --> 04:02:35,809
Pick up line.

3280
04:02:35,809 --> 04:02:36,610
Ask if single.

3281
04:02:36,610 --> 04:02:37,649
Ask on a date.

3282
04:02:45,020 --> 04:02:45,659
Make a wish.

3283
04:02:46,219 --> 04:02:48,219
Not yet.

3284
04:02:53,819 --> 04:02:54,459
We're going on a date.

3285
04:02:55,100 --> 04:02:56,139
The banana and the genie.

3286
04:02:56,139 --> 04:02:57,579
I'm going on a date right now.

3287
04:02:58,139 --> 04:03:00,559
Remember, the chaos book is missing.

3288
04:03:00,559 --> 04:03:00,959
It's okay.

3289
04:03:01,520 --> 04:03:03,940
Where are we going to go?

3290
04:03:06,100 --> 04:03:06,979
Fashion district.

3291
04:03:08,559 --> 04:03:09,360
Karaoke bar.

3292
04:03:10,079 --> 04:03:14,450
That sounds like fun.

3293
04:03:15,010 --> 04:03:28,270
Okay, here we go.

3294
04:03:28,270 --> 04:03:29,469
We're going on a date with the genie.

3295
04:03:32,620 --> 04:03:34,219
So socialize with your date.

3296
04:03:34,219 --> 04:03:35,180
Sit and talk with your date.

3297
04:03:36,819 --> 04:03:37,379
Socialize.

3298
04:03:39,219 --> 04:03:39,620
How about...

3299
04:03:40,260 --> 04:03:43,299
What are you doing?

3300
04:03:43,860 --> 04:03:44,670
What are you doing?

3301
04:03:44,670 --> 04:03:44,989
What are you doing?

3302
04:03:44,989 --> 04:03:45,309
What are you doing?

3303
04:03:45,309 --> 04:03:46,030
What are you doing?

3304
04:03:46,030 --> 04:03:46,590
What are you doing?

3305
04:03:46,590 --> 04:03:48,030
Why would you leave the date immediately?

3306
04:03:48,030 --> 04:03:48,670
What's wrong with you?

3307
04:03:49,309 --> 04:03:51,840
You got an other worldly being.

3308
04:03:54,290 --> 04:03:54,770
Romance.

3309
04:03:54,770 --> 04:03:55,090
Romance.

3310
04:03:55,090 --> 04:03:55,569
Romance.

3311
04:03:55,569 --> 04:03:55,969
Flirt.

3312
04:03:59,120 --> 04:03:59,520
What?

3313
04:03:59,520 --> 04:04:00,479
ADHD.

3314
04:04:00,479 --> 04:04:01,600
Why are you naked?

3315
04:04:04,180 --> 04:04:06,180
Why are you naked in a karaoke bar?

3316
04:04:07,229 --> 04:04:07,549
What?

3317
04:04:08,670 --> 04:04:09,950
She's taking a sh...

3318
04:04:15,010 --> 04:04:17,649
Why are you taking a shower?

3319
04:04:32,129 --> 04:04:34,399
No, don't leave.

3320
04:04:34,399 --> 04:04:34,959
Don't leave.

3321
04:04:34,959 --> 04:04:35,520
Don't leave.

3322
04:04:35,520 --> 04:04:36,239
Don't leave.

3323
04:04:37,420 --> 04:04:38,059
No.

3324
04:04:38,059 --> 04:04:39,659
I'm gonna get fucking stood up.

3325
04:04:40,379 --> 04:04:42,940
She's checking out the other mystical being that's here, isn't she?

3326
04:04:44,239 --> 04:04:45,280
She's flirting with death.

3327
04:05:02,850 --> 04:05:15,280
All right, give me a break.

3328
04:05:15,280 --> 04:05:16,319
The lady was naked.

3329
04:05:16,319 --> 04:05:18,879
She came out and was taking a shower in the rain.

3330
04:05:18,879 --> 04:05:20,159
And somebody ran her over.

3331
04:05:21,979 --> 04:05:24,219
Why is everyone crying?

3332
04:05:32,020 --> 04:05:33,459
Everyone doesn't have to be crying.

3333
04:05:43,219 --> 04:05:44,420
No, I gotta reset.

3334
04:05:44,420 --> 04:05:45,620
I have to redo it.

3335
04:05:45,620 --> 04:05:46,100
Reset.

3336
04:05:58,209 --> 04:06:00,370
I got an unbelievable story for you.

3337
04:06:00,370 --> 04:06:03,010
So this girl, she was naked in the bar.

3338
04:06:04,049 --> 04:06:05,010
She came outside.

3339
04:06:05,649 --> 04:06:06,290
Nude.

3340
04:06:06,290 --> 04:06:08,690
Started washing under her armpits and shit.

3341
04:06:08,690 --> 04:06:09,889
And what do you know?

3342
04:06:09,889 --> 04:06:12,209
A car comes flying down the street.

3343
04:06:12,850 --> 04:06:13,649
Nails her.

3344
04:06:13,649 --> 04:06:15,010
I mean, like fucking nails her.

3345
04:06:15,010 --> 04:06:16,049
It was ridiculous.

3346
04:06:18,510 --> 04:06:18,909
I'm in.

3347
04:06:20,590 --> 04:06:21,309
She likes me again.

3348
04:06:23,709 --> 04:06:25,790
Recycled joke from last time.

3349
04:06:28,350 --> 04:06:29,469
If a line works, you know.

3350
04:06:30,270 --> 04:06:34,159
No, I'm not gonna open fire.

3351
04:06:37,329 --> 04:06:39,250
Okay, how about romance?

3352
04:06:39,250 --> 04:06:42,530
Are you single?

3353
04:06:46,799 --> 04:06:47,920
Why would I do that right now?

3354
04:06:47,920 --> 04:06:50,159
I don't want to have to save the game every five seconds.

3355
04:07:00,299 --> 04:07:02,299
Okay, let's see.

3356
04:07:02,299 --> 04:07:02,780
Romance.

3357
04:07:04,059 --> 04:07:05,100
Okay, exchange numbers.

3358
04:07:05,899 --> 04:07:07,020
Does Genie have a number?

3359
04:07:16,350 --> 04:07:17,069
All right, can we stop?

3360
04:07:17,069 --> 04:07:18,270
Can we go somewhere else, please?

3361
04:07:18,270 --> 04:07:23,579
What?

3362
04:07:25,260 --> 04:07:26,059
That doesn't...

3363
04:07:26,059 --> 04:07:27,340
Who's changing into nude?

3364
04:07:28,299 --> 04:07:28,540
Me?

3365
04:07:29,579 --> 04:07:35,170
Put it back on.

3366
04:07:35,170 --> 04:07:35,649
Put it back on.

3367
04:07:35,649 --> 04:07:36,690
Put your clothes back on.

3368
04:07:36,690 --> 04:07:37,729
Before anybody notices.

3369
04:07:37,729 --> 04:07:38,370
Quick.

3370
04:07:38,370 --> 04:07:42,190
She's disgusted.

3371
04:07:42,190 --> 04:07:59,250
I think I'm losing her.

3372
04:08:16,190 --> 04:08:16,979
It's all right.

3373
04:08:16,979 --> 04:08:43,600
Never really calm down.

3374
04:08:44,239 --> 04:09:07,549
Oh, what a day.

3375
04:09:47,979 --> 04:09:56,270
No, it's not.

3376
04:09:56,270 --> 04:09:56,909
You don't like it?

3377
04:10:04,129 --> 04:10:04,930
She's sitting down.

3378
04:10:29,709 --> 04:10:33,469
Okay, I don't know how to put my clothes back on.

3379
04:10:34,670 --> 04:10:37,090
I really, I don't know.

3380
04:11:00,899 --> 04:11:02,180
Okay, okay.

3381
04:11:02,180 --> 04:11:03,299
This has gone too far.

3382
04:11:08,819 --> 04:11:10,500
Time to hit him with a car, I guess.

3383
04:11:18,059 --> 04:11:21,760
Can we go home?

3384
04:11:21,760 --> 04:11:23,520
Like, I need to get out of here so I can clean up.

3385
04:11:27,120 --> 04:11:27,440
Really?

3386
04:11:28,959 --> 04:11:29,360
Shut up.

3387
04:11:32,190 --> 04:11:32,430
Good.

3388
04:11:33,309 --> 04:11:35,100
Wait, is that it?

3389
04:11:35,579 --> 04:11:36,540
You got, you don't have more.

3390
04:11:50,510 --> 04:11:51,389
Age down?

3391
04:11:54,459 --> 04:11:55,020
Oh, shit.

3392
04:11:55,739 --> 04:12:03,729
Where am I?

3393
04:12:08,340 --> 04:12:09,940
Did I just clean myself from the toilet?

3394
04:12:14,299 --> 04:12:15,180
Where can I get clothes?

3395
04:12:15,180 --> 04:12:16,299
Can I change clothes in here?

3396
04:12:20,530 --> 04:12:20,850
Uh-oh.

3397
04:12:22,610 --> 04:12:24,370
I think I'm about to lose my date to the gnome.

3398
04:12:31,790 --> 04:12:32,829
Date unsuccessful.

3399
04:12:33,469 --> 04:13:04,350
Jesus Christ.

3400
04:13:05,149 --> 04:13:06,350
All right, no, no, no, no.

3401
04:13:06,350 --> 04:13:07,709
Back home, back home, back home, back home.

3402
04:13:07,709 --> 04:13:08,510
Where'd she go?

3403
04:13:08,510 --> 04:13:09,149
Where's the genie?

3404
04:13:10,540 --> 04:13:10,940
Go home.

3405
04:13:11,659 --> 04:13:12,459
You fucking blew it.

3406
04:13:12,459 --> 04:13:12,940
Get out of here.

3407
04:13:15,010 --> 04:13:16,930
Up next on American Idol, yeah.

3408
04:13:18,139 --> 04:13:19,819
All right, go home, go home, go home.

3409
04:13:30,290 --> 04:13:30,610
Leave.

3410
04:13:31,569 --> 04:13:32,129
Go home.

3411
04:13:33,459 --> 04:13:34,579
I'm just going home.

3412
04:13:34,579 --> 04:13:34,899
Fuck it.

3413
04:13:36,500 --> 04:13:36,899
Get there.

3414
04:13:38,290 --> 04:13:39,250
Center on that lot.

3415
04:13:40,209 --> 04:13:40,930
Get out of here.

3416
04:13:40,930 --> 04:13:41,170
Leave.

3417
04:13:43,170 --> 04:13:43,489
Leave.

3418
04:13:48,079 --> 04:13:49,440
Just go home.

3419
04:13:49,440 --> 04:13:56,579
Where are you going?

3420
04:13:58,989 --> 04:14:01,709
Pauline Pair reached video game level three.

3421
04:14:13,280 --> 04:14:15,520
That's the funniest thing that's happened to all stream.

3422
04:14:16,159 --> 04:14:19,709
He let go of his hands, sneezed.

3423
04:14:20,510 --> 04:14:23,389
That's the funniest fucking thing I've seen all stream.

3424
04:14:31,309 --> 04:14:32,430
How do we get out of here?

3425
04:14:33,389 --> 04:14:38,989
Oh, fuck.

3426
04:14:38,989 --> 04:14:39,870
Now I'm doing this.

3427
04:14:47,420 --> 04:14:48,860
It's happy hour at the karaoke bar.

3428
04:14:48,860 --> 04:14:50,219
I have half drinks, a half fries.

3429
04:14:50,780 --> 04:14:56,079
I don't give a shit about the banana.

3430
04:14:56,079 --> 04:14:56,799
He's a moron.

3431
04:14:57,360 --> 04:15:01,950
What kind of super villain can sneeze without the urethra closing?

3432
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:02,590
I have no idea.

3433
04:15:03,389 --> 04:15:11,500
So go to the bathroom.

3434
04:15:12,059 --> 04:15:14,100
All right, I didn't even get a chance here.

3435
04:15:14,739 --> 04:15:15,540
How's everybody doing?

3436
04:15:16,180 --> 04:15:17,059
Bladder and energy.

3437
04:15:17,059 --> 04:15:18,100
Go to the bathroom then.

3438
04:15:18,100 --> 04:15:18,739
What's the problem?

3439
04:15:24,700 --> 04:15:24,940
What?

3440
04:15:30,190 --> 04:15:31,309
Didn't I shoot him in the head?

3441
04:15:35,280 --> 04:15:35,840
Okay.

3442
04:15:35,840 --> 04:15:37,040
Do I not have a bathroom?

3443
04:15:38,020 --> 04:15:38,500
No, I do.

3444
04:15:46,319 --> 04:15:50,559
So Pauline Pair is the best gamer in the house, just in case anyone's curious.

3445
04:15:51,280 --> 04:16:02,559
For a second, I thought she was naked and I was going to say,

3446
04:16:02,559 --> 04:16:04,479
wait a minute, I shouldn't have that on the screen.

3447
04:16:06,459 --> 04:16:08,700
Like, I thought it wasn't censored and it was just open.

3448
04:16:09,340 --> 04:16:10,829
All right.

3449
04:16:10,829 --> 04:16:12,030
Come back home.

3450
04:16:12,030 --> 04:16:12,510
Tidy up.

3451
04:16:12,510 --> 04:16:13,069
Care for yourself.

3452
04:16:13,069 --> 04:16:16,340
Bring Benedict Banana here.

3453
04:16:16,340 --> 04:16:17,219
Get over here.

3454
04:16:18,659 --> 04:16:19,540
Still naked.

3455
04:16:21,260 --> 04:16:22,780
Go just take a shower.

3456
04:16:22,780 --> 04:16:26,000
No, that's okay.

3457
04:16:26,799 --> 04:16:28,379
What is in here?

3458
04:16:28,940 --> 04:16:32,020
The Humor and Hijinks Festival is in town.

3459
04:16:32,020 --> 04:16:34,739
Click on any of the dynamic signs around town to find out more.

3460
04:16:36,000 --> 04:16:36,559
Okay.

3461
04:16:36,559 --> 04:16:38,559
Travel to the Humor and Hijinks Festival.

3462
04:16:38,559 --> 04:16:45,090
Who wants to go?

3463
04:16:46,530 --> 04:16:47,010
I don't know.

3464
04:16:51,620 --> 04:16:51,940
Who is it?

3465
04:16:51,940 --> 04:16:52,979
I don't even know who these people are.

3466
04:16:57,040 --> 04:16:58,079
No, you guys have a stay.

3467
04:16:59,100 --> 04:17:01,579
The banana is the piece of just crap.

3468
04:17:01,579 --> 04:17:04,000
This is the genie?

3469
04:17:07,469 --> 04:17:08,030
Is it?

3470
04:17:08,030 --> 04:17:08,670
No, it's not.

3471
04:17:09,309 --> 04:17:18,100
How would I get in contact with the genie?

3472
04:17:30,319 --> 04:17:31,200
Actually, is the genie?

3473
04:17:32,930 --> 04:17:34,209
Oh, I fucking stink.

3474
04:17:34,209 --> 04:17:34,770
God damn it.

3475
04:17:35,489 --> 04:17:37,649
The pranksters and jokesters challenge has begun.

3476
04:17:37,649 --> 04:17:41,489
Drink from either the dark or light tea to join a side.

3477
04:17:41,489 --> 04:17:47,100
Okay, I mean, can I have to drink from the dark tea, right?

3478
04:17:53,280 --> 04:17:54,079
Oh, Jesus.

3479
04:17:55,739 --> 04:17:56,139
All right.

3480
04:17:56,139 --> 04:17:56,620
Give me the...

3481
04:17:58,610 --> 04:17:59,329
Order food.

3482
04:17:59,329 --> 04:17:59,649
Funny.

3483
04:18:00,450 --> 04:18:04,180
How do I order a tea?

3484
04:18:04,979 --> 04:18:14,479
Of course, the gnome is here.

3485
04:18:14,479 --> 04:18:15,040
Hijinks.

3486
04:18:15,760 --> 04:18:18,860
Where am I?

3487
04:18:19,739 --> 04:18:21,340
I wasn't even ready for this.

3488
04:18:25,790 --> 04:18:26,510
View.

3489
04:18:26,510 --> 04:18:27,229
No, get over here.

3490
04:18:27,709 --> 04:18:28,670
Stop viewing things.

3491
04:18:29,149 --> 04:18:29,709
Go to the bar.

3492
04:18:35,280 --> 04:18:36,319
He's very sad.

3493
04:18:37,700 --> 04:18:38,420
Oh, come on.

3494
04:18:40,770 --> 04:18:45,549
Well, join the pranksters.

3495
04:18:45,549 --> 04:18:46,670
Join the pranksters together.

3496
04:18:47,389 --> 04:18:54,909
I was trying to get him to go to the bar, but he's too sad to move.

3497
04:18:55,549 --> 04:18:58,750
Okay, so the genie is going to join the pranksters.

3498
04:19:02,670 --> 04:19:04,110
I told you, I won't move.

3499
04:19:04,989 --> 04:19:08,319
I'm all the way back into the art gallery.

3500
04:19:08,879 --> 04:19:10,350
Can I take a shower in here?

3501
04:19:14,530 --> 04:19:16,190
No.

3502
04:19:16,190 --> 04:19:16,590
Hurry up.

3503
04:19:16,590 --> 04:19:17,149
Get over there.

3504
04:19:20,270 --> 04:19:24,430
The girl you are hanging out with here is currently doing things and having fun.

3505
04:19:24,430 --> 04:19:24,930
Go.

3506
04:19:33,979 --> 04:19:34,780
Take a sip.

3507
04:19:34,780 --> 04:19:49,840
All right, better just join the pranksters.

3508
04:19:49,840 --> 04:19:51,360
Perform pranks?

3509
04:19:52,079 --> 04:19:54,379
All right, so we got to prank people.

3510
04:19:57,040 --> 04:19:58,239
Festival is starting, I think.

3511
04:19:58,239 --> 04:19:59,760
I think we now just have to do some pranks.

3512
04:20:06,159 --> 04:20:06,559
Something...

3513
04:20:06,559 --> 04:20:07,600
Nothing too crazy.

3514
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:08,159
A prank.

3515
04:20:10,899 --> 04:20:12,500
Order a drink for...

3516
04:20:13,940 --> 04:20:20,209
You got to prank the people that are glowing.

3517
04:20:20,209 --> 04:20:21,329
All right, let's prank this guy.

3518
04:20:24,930 --> 04:20:25,809
All right, let's prank you.

3519
04:20:30,399 --> 04:20:31,840
Okay, more choices.

3520
04:20:34,159 --> 04:20:35,120
Uh, mean.

3521
04:20:36,319 --> 04:20:36,819
No.

3522
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:38,180
Funny.

3523
04:20:38,879 --> 04:20:39,680
Funny introduction.

3524
04:20:45,889 --> 04:20:46,690
This is a prank?

3525
04:21:02,049 --> 04:21:03,729
Oh no, the people that are glowing.

3526
04:21:03,729 --> 04:21:05,329
Okay, other way, way, way, way.

3527
04:21:05,329 --> 04:21:06,530
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3528
04:21:07,489 --> 04:21:08,770
All right, let's get a prank here.

3529
04:21:20,559 --> 04:21:26,059
All right, hack info.

3530
04:21:33,180 --> 04:21:33,819
That look.

3531
04:21:34,620 --> 04:21:38,290
The jokesters are in the lead.

3532
04:21:39,889 --> 04:21:45,659
Cut this shit out.

3533
04:21:54,000 --> 04:21:57,360
Um, what else am I supposed to do?

3534
04:21:58,559 --> 04:21:59,200
Chat with Penny.

3535
04:22:02,659 --> 04:22:03,700
I mean, is it mean?

3536
04:22:03,700 --> 04:22:04,819
Is it just like funny?

3537
04:22:18,670 --> 04:22:19,549
Steal money.

3538
04:22:20,510 --> 04:22:23,629
Fuckin' snitch.

3539
04:22:26,659 --> 04:22:27,860
No, I can't kill anybody.

3540
04:22:27,860 --> 04:22:28,180
We have to...

3541
04:22:28,180 --> 04:22:30,020
There's a cooldown period for when we can kill.

3542
04:22:30,899 --> 04:22:35,010
All right, I'm gonna introduce myself.

3543
04:22:35,010 --> 04:22:37,649
Probably should have slept before this, but I kind of just knee-jerked.

3544
04:22:38,370 --> 04:22:40,000
Where am I?

3545
04:22:40,000 --> 04:22:47,219
What am I doing in here?

3546
04:22:55,010 --> 04:22:56,610
I'm going all the way up the stairs?

3547
04:22:57,250 --> 04:22:57,489
No.

3548
04:23:01,680 --> 04:23:02,079
Okay.

3549
04:23:16,270 --> 04:23:18,670
This is what you wanted to do?

3550
04:23:23,059 --> 04:23:23,379
Why?

3551
04:23:24,100 --> 04:23:27,020
He's like playing with dirt.

3552
04:23:27,659 --> 04:23:33,680
You walked all the way up here to do this.

3553
04:23:40,590 --> 04:23:52,510
I'm very disappointed right now.

3554
04:24:14,850 --> 04:24:15,729
What does that do?

3555
04:24:20,590 --> 04:24:22,270
I snatched my own weave.

3556
04:24:31,149 --> 04:24:32,110
All right, go home.

3557
04:24:32,909 --> 04:24:33,629
I'm done with you.

3558
04:24:34,430 --> 04:24:36,860
Go home.

3559
04:24:37,500 --> 04:24:38,579
I'm done with you.

3560
04:24:44,590 --> 04:24:46,030
Let's focus on somebody else.

3561
04:24:51,139 --> 04:24:52,739
He's like putting his hands out and running like...

3562
04:24:53,940 --> 04:24:58,639
I'm an asshole.

3563
04:25:06,370 --> 04:25:08,299
All right, here we go.

3564
04:25:11,569 --> 04:25:13,569
I think it's time to assume control.

3565
04:25:17,620 --> 04:25:19,620
Where is the question?

3566
04:25:20,260 --> 04:25:20,899
Mac and cheese.

3567
04:25:20,899 --> 04:25:21,379
Excellent.

3568
04:25:21,379 --> 04:25:22,579
Okay, fun and social.

3569
04:25:22,579 --> 04:25:23,860
He needs to have some social shit.

3570
04:25:24,579 --> 04:25:26,370
Where's the lamp?

3571
04:25:26,930 --> 04:25:28,100
Rub the lamp.

3572
04:25:28,100 --> 04:25:30,579
This is the guy that technically the genie is...

3573
04:25:32,020 --> 04:25:33,940
It's his, right?

3574
04:25:38,750 --> 04:25:40,270
Okay, I want some wishes.

3575
04:25:43,889 --> 04:25:44,370
Call over.

3576
04:25:47,620 --> 04:25:48,340
No, not you.

3577
04:25:48,340 --> 04:25:48,579
You.

3578
04:25:50,979 --> 04:25:51,700
More choices.

3579
04:25:52,260 --> 04:25:53,309
How do I get...

3580
04:25:53,309 --> 04:25:53,709
Genie.

3581
04:25:53,709 --> 04:25:54,590
There we go.

3582
04:25:54,590 --> 04:25:56,030
Wish for the genie's freedom.

3583
04:25:57,540 --> 04:25:58,260
Wish for wealth.

3584
04:25:58,260 --> 04:25:58,899
Wish for youth.

3585
04:25:58,899 --> 04:26:00,260
Wish for world peace.

3586
04:26:06,739 --> 04:26:08,340
Wish for the genie's freedom.

3587
04:26:10,110 --> 04:26:11,069
Not yet.

3588
04:26:11,069 --> 04:26:12,190
Wish for world peace.

3589
04:26:12,190 --> 04:26:12,829
Let's see what happens.

3590
04:26:20,979 --> 04:26:21,459
Did it work?

3591
04:26:23,219 --> 04:26:27,979
What does that do?

3592
04:26:29,180 --> 04:26:30,459
Peter, your wish has been granted.

3593
04:26:32,930 --> 04:26:39,889
Well, that's funny.

3594
04:26:40,620 --> 04:26:42,540
Because it's impossible for there to be world peace.

3595
04:26:43,180 --> 04:26:47,229
Because I still have the decisions to make here.

3596
04:26:47,790 --> 04:26:48,719
What does that do?

3597
04:26:52,020 --> 04:26:53,299
Wish for romance.

3598
04:26:53,299 --> 04:26:53,620
Okay.

3599
04:26:54,590 --> 04:26:55,069
With who?

3600
04:26:55,709 --> 04:26:59,440
Is the banana still sad?

3601
04:26:59,440 --> 04:27:01,920
The banana still is at the gallery playing with mud.

3602
04:27:04,819 --> 04:27:06,180
Everyone's really happy now.

3603
04:27:06,180 --> 04:27:10,979
Oh, this is gonna make the banana real sad.

3604
04:27:11,860 --> 04:27:16,559
How many wishes do you get?

3605
04:27:17,120 --> 04:27:20,350
Peter, your wish has been granted.

3606
04:27:20,350 --> 04:27:24,940
Okay, so who do I flirt with?

3607
04:27:25,579 --> 04:27:27,620
Am I...

3608
04:27:32,930 --> 04:27:33,649
It's just us?

3609
04:27:34,290 --> 04:27:37,379
Where are we going?

3610
04:27:37,379 --> 04:27:49,760
Nobody can stop me.

3611
04:27:49,760 --> 04:27:50,479
Cupid's arrow.

3612
04:28:02,000 --> 04:28:03,360
She's the ultimate gamer.

3613
04:28:03,360 --> 04:28:09,790
Look at this.

3614
04:28:09,790 --> 04:28:12,270
Evangelize vegetarian benefits.

3615
04:28:21,739 --> 04:28:27,360
Oh, you blew it.

3616
04:28:27,360 --> 04:28:27,920
You blew it.

3617
04:28:27,920 --> 04:28:28,639
You blew it!

3618
04:28:35,010 --> 04:28:35,969
Let's have a conversation here.

3619
04:28:38,370 --> 04:28:38,770
Let's see.

3620
04:28:45,950 --> 04:28:47,069
Cupid's arrow, huh?

3621
04:28:47,069 --> 04:28:47,549
My ass.

3622
04:28:48,350 --> 04:29:00,719
Let's go to romance again.

3623
04:29:00,719 --> 04:29:03,819
Let's...

3624
04:29:06,030 --> 04:29:07,149
Casual discussion.

3625
04:29:07,149 --> 04:29:08,030
Okay, hold on.

3626
04:29:08,030 --> 04:29:08,829
Let's go on a date.

3627
04:29:10,270 --> 04:29:12,399
All right, I'll take you on a date to the gallery.

3628
04:29:17,329 --> 04:29:18,049
Has it got the...

3629
04:29:18,049 --> 04:29:18,930
Did I just say no?

3630
04:29:20,370 --> 04:29:22,059
I didn't get a chance to do it.

3631
04:29:24,219 --> 04:29:25,500
Taking her on a date to the gallery.

3632
04:29:26,139 --> 04:29:28,739
At the Casbah gallery.

3633
04:29:48,479 --> 04:29:48,799
Shit!

3634
04:29:51,620 --> 04:29:52,340
How about just...

3635
04:29:52,340 --> 04:29:54,020
I'll just say a compliment.

3636
04:29:54,020 --> 04:29:54,500
I don't know.

3637
04:29:55,059 --> 04:29:56,290
What book is that?

3638
04:29:57,010 --> 04:29:57,889
What book are you reading?

3639
04:30:00,020 --> 04:30:01,940
Reading real her in.

3640
04:30:09,170 --> 04:30:11,409
Perfect reading material right now, apparently.

3641
04:30:11,409 --> 04:30:11,729
Okay.

3642
04:30:13,500 --> 04:30:15,020
Look at this fucking gamer.

3643
04:30:15,020 --> 04:30:16,059
This is unbelievable.

3644
04:30:32,979 --> 04:30:34,579
He read the book and now he's gonna see if it works.

3645
04:30:39,420 --> 04:30:40,780
The banana is still...

3646
04:30:40,780 --> 04:30:41,979
I don't even know what the banana is.

3647
04:30:42,940 --> 04:30:43,579
Playing with dirt.

3648
04:30:43,579 --> 04:30:51,540
Shower in the rain.

3649
04:30:51,540 --> 04:30:52,020
Why is this...

3650
04:30:52,020 --> 04:30:53,700
I don't understand the shower in the rain shit.

3651
04:30:55,459 --> 04:30:57,540
He's picking up the book to go learn.

3652
04:30:57,540 --> 04:30:58,020
That's right.

3653
04:30:58,020 --> 04:31:01,139
You go fucking figure it out first before you make any dumb moves.

3654
04:31:04,100 --> 04:31:04,579
Ah, fuck.

3655
04:31:05,700 --> 04:31:08,500
I really gotta learn what the fuck I'm doing when I talk to women.

3656
04:31:08,500 --> 04:31:10,180
I'm not really making a fool of myself.

3657
04:31:14,909 --> 04:31:15,629
Uh, let's get some...

3658
04:31:18,049 --> 04:31:19,170
What happened to the book of chaos?

3659
04:31:20,930 --> 04:31:21,809
Oh, banana's back.

3660
04:31:27,950 --> 04:31:28,909
No, not even hello.

3661
04:31:29,549 --> 04:31:29,950
Nothing.

3662
04:31:31,569 --> 04:31:32,770
Just good night.

3663
04:31:32,770 --> 04:31:33,329
I'm going to bed.

3664
04:31:34,049 --> 04:31:37,760
I feel bad.

3665
04:31:38,559 --> 04:31:44,180
I actually feel kind of bad.

3666
04:31:44,180 --> 04:31:44,739
I really do.

3667
04:31:51,680 --> 04:31:52,159
All right.

3668
04:31:52,159 --> 04:31:53,920
Who has the highest...

3669
04:31:55,360 --> 04:31:56,639
I want to see if somebody can...

3670
04:31:56,639 --> 04:31:57,200
I want that...

3671
04:31:57,840 --> 04:31:59,840
I want the genie as a love interest.

3672
04:32:01,860 --> 04:32:02,420
Who has the...

3673
04:32:02,420 --> 04:32:03,219
Okay, awkward.

3674
04:32:03,860 --> 04:32:08,030
Should I wake up the banana?

3675
04:32:13,659 --> 04:32:14,620
Free the genie first?

3676
04:32:15,340 --> 04:32:18,559
Where's the genie gonna live, guys?

3677
04:32:20,559 --> 04:32:23,889
I mean, that's great.

3678
04:32:23,889 --> 04:32:25,090
Like, oh, like, yeah.

3679
04:32:25,170 --> 04:32:27,010
Genie, here you are.

3680
04:32:27,010 --> 04:32:28,610
You don't have to, like, be in the lamp.

3681
04:32:28,610 --> 04:32:29,489
We got two beds here.

3682
04:32:33,680 --> 04:32:41,229
Let's get to know each other.

3683
04:32:42,930 --> 04:32:43,969
Ask about your career.

3684
04:32:49,969 --> 04:32:50,450
All right.

3685
04:32:51,329 --> 04:32:52,370
The reading paid off.

3686
04:32:55,489 --> 04:32:59,889
What are you doing?

3687
04:33:01,489 --> 04:33:03,250
No, this is the problem.

3688
04:33:03,250 --> 04:33:06,529
You guys, you can't just go play on the computer.

3689
04:33:14,689 --> 04:33:15,169
She's gone.

3690
04:33:15,169 --> 04:33:15,569
She left.

3691
04:33:16,130 --> 04:33:20,860
Time to go play Sims forever.

3692
04:33:20,860 --> 04:33:21,099
What?

3693
04:33:21,659 --> 04:33:27,659
What do you mean forever?

3694
04:33:33,549 --> 04:33:33,869
Okay.

3695
04:33:35,169 --> 04:33:40,139
Well, I think it's time to check on the other household.

3696
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:43,139
See how they're doing.

3697
04:33:43,860 --> 04:33:47,919
Let's head out to the map.

3698
04:33:47,919 --> 04:33:53,119
Let's get a save.

3699
04:33:53,840 --> 04:33:56,369
Let's check on the other household.

3700
04:34:00,909 --> 04:34:02,189
No, we gotta go back, right?

3701
04:34:05,709 --> 04:34:06,509
Cancel the travel.

3702
04:34:06,509 --> 04:34:08,830
Oh, how do I go back to manage worlds, right?

3703
04:34:11,119 --> 04:34:12,720
Just go to manage worlds.

3704
04:34:13,439 --> 04:34:22,130
All right.

3705
04:34:23,740 --> 04:34:24,380
This is the fruits.

3706
04:34:24,380 --> 04:34:25,099
We don't need to see them.

3707
04:34:25,099 --> 04:34:25,740
Let's go to...

3708
04:34:26,939 --> 04:34:28,450
That's the gnome.

3709
04:34:28,450 --> 04:34:29,810
I don't want to play with the gnome.

3710
04:34:31,220 --> 04:34:31,459
All right.

3711
04:34:31,459 --> 04:34:33,060
Let's do some stuff with these three.

3712
04:34:33,779 --> 04:34:35,619
Let's go to like a club or something or a bar.

3713
04:34:35,619 --> 04:34:37,540
Some like a video game hangout or something.

3714
04:34:38,340 --> 04:34:40,080
Select the Sim to play.

3715
04:34:41,970 --> 04:34:42,689
Me.

3716
04:34:42,689 --> 04:34:44,340
I just saved.

3717
04:34:44,979 --> 04:34:47,150
Yeah, I'm good.

3718
04:34:47,150 --> 04:34:47,549
I saved.

3719
04:34:48,110 --> 04:34:53,169
I'm already at the bar.

3720
04:34:53,169 --> 04:34:53,490
All right.

3721
04:34:54,130 --> 04:34:56,159
I'm ready.

3722
04:34:56,159 --> 04:34:58,610
I'm here with the dog.

3723
04:34:58,610 --> 04:34:59,490
Why is the dog here?

3724
04:35:00,209 --> 04:35:05,409
Why is the dog here?

3725
04:35:05,409 --> 04:35:08,369
How would I bring the dog?

3726
04:35:08,369 --> 04:35:09,090
There's nobody here.

3727
04:35:09,889 --> 04:35:11,659
What am I doing outside?

3728
04:35:12,380 --> 04:35:20,849
Well, that's...

3729
04:35:20,849 --> 04:35:21,970
There's two people at that bar.

3730
04:35:22,689 --> 04:35:25,540
All right.

3731
04:35:25,540 --> 04:35:26,340
Let's go.

3732
04:35:26,340 --> 04:35:26,979
Let's take a walk.

3733
04:35:28,900 --> 04:35:31,419
Go do your business.

3734
04:35:34,590 --> 04:35:35,549
He's pissing on me.

3735
04:35:39,299 --> 04:35:40,500
No one has died in a bit.

3736
04:35:40,500 --> 04:35:41,139
Just saying.

3737
04:35:43,299 --> 04:35:47,340
That's because I haven't turned on auto kill.

3738
04:35:51,939 --> 04:35:55,069
Well, I can't pick it up.

3739
04:35:55,069 --> 04:35:56,990
How am I doing on stats?

3740
04:35:58,639 --> 04:35:59,279
Where is it here?

3741
04:36:01,490 --> 04:36:02,209
Let's see.

3742
04:36:02,209 --> 04:36:03,009
I'm actually pretty good.

3743
04:36:03,810 --> 04:36:04,380
All right.

3744
04:36:04,380 --> 04:36:06,139
Get unpleasant surround.

3745
04:36:06,139 --> 04:36:07,099
Let's go home.

3746
04:36:07,099 --> 04:36:07,819
Let's go back.

3747
04:36:08,700 --> 04:36:09,340
Back in the house.

3748
04:36:10,220 --> 04:36:15,580
Back in the house.

3749
04:36:18,720 --> 04:36:19,599
You don't need to be here.

3750
04:36:19,599 --> 04:36:22,659
Back in the move-in household.

3751
04:36:22,659 --> 04:36:23,380
Visit apartment.

3752
04:36:23,380 --> 04:36:24,659
Who's visiting?

3753
04:36:27,709 --> 04:36:28,750
I'm visiting somebody's house.

3754
04:36:40,319 --> 04:36:40,799
Or...

3755
04:36:40,799 --> 04:36:41,439
Okay.

3756
04:36:41,439 --> 04:36:42,240
Whose house is this?

3757
04:36:43,119 --> 04:36:49,900
I didn't get kicked out of my own house.

3758
04:36:50,979 --> 04:36:52,500
702 Zenview.

3759
04:36:55,040 --> 04:36:56,159
This is my house.

3760
04:37:00,319 --> 04:37:00,720
All right.

3761
04:37:02,110 --> 04:37:03,310
Let's see what happens.

3762
04:37:03,310 --> 04:37:04,110
Let's save it here.

3763
04:37:08,299 --> 04:37:09,419
I didn't get evicted though.

3764
04:37:11,599 --> 04:37:12,240
Where's the broom?

3765
04:37:12,959 --> 04:37:15,360
Everyone's obsessed with the damn computer.

3766
04:37:17,810 --> 04:37:18,290
All right.

3767
04:37:18,290 --> 04:37:20,290
It's time to make a murder mystery happen.

3768
04:37:20,529 --> 04:37:21,569
Let's have a killer here.

3769
04:37:25,439 --> 04:37:26,159
And maybe not.

3770
04:37:26,159 --> 04:37:26,560
Not yet.

3771
04:37:26,560 --> 04:37:27,119
Not yet.

3772
04:37:27,119 --> 04:37:28,799
Let's have a fucking party here or something.

3773
04:37:28,799 --> 04:37:29,040
Let's...

3774
04:37:29,599 --> 04:37:35,740
The cat is sick?

3775
04:37:36,380 --> 04:37:43,340
How is the cat sick?

3776
04:37:44,560 --> 04:37:45,680
Anxious plus three.

3777
04:37:55,470 --> 04:37:56,909
I'm not putting the cat in the fucking oven.

3778
04:37:58,110 --> 04:37:58,430
All right.

3779
04:38:00,209 --> 04:38:00,849
I need to...

3780
04:38:00,849 --> 04:38:01,970
Cat needs to eat.

3781
04:38:01,970 --> 04:38:03,250
So eat and then let's play.

3782
04:38:05,819 --> 04:38:06,700
Are there food bowls?

3783
04:38:07,869 --> 04:38:08,669
There's food right here.

3784
04:38:09,470 --> 04:38:13,840
You sound like a goddamn ghost from Mario 64.

3785
04:38:16,209 --> 04:38:17,169
Where are the food bowls?

3786
04:38:17,169 --> 04:38:18,369
Didn't I have two of them?

3787
04:38:24,029 --> 04:38:24,590
Apparently not.

3788
04:38:24,590 --> 04:38:25,630
Maybe it was before I saved.

3789
04:38:26,270 --> 04:38:35,470
I'm gonna throw a party.

3790
04:38:47,759 --> 04:38:48,959
No, I gotta fill it with me.

3791
04:38:50,479 --> 04:38:53,549
She's hungry.

3792
04:38:53,549 --> 04:38:56,779
All right.

3793
04:38:56,779 --> 04:38:58,459
Let me see what happens now.

3794
04:38:59,939 --> 04:39:00,819
Hunger is pretty low.

3795
04:39:00,819 --> 04:39:01,380
Let's go eat.

3796
04:39:02,099 --> 04:39:03,650
And then I'm throwing a party.

3797
04:39:03,650 --> 04:39:05,009
I'm inviting all my friends over.

3798
04:39:09,869 --> 04:39:10,110
Why?

3799
04:39:10,110 --> 04:39:11,229
What's wrong with the cat?

3800
04:39:11,229 --> 04:39:11,630
What?

3801
04:39:11,630 --> 04:39:11,950
Play.

3802
04:39:12,830 --> 04:39:13,150
Play.

3803
04:39:13,150 --> 04:39:13,389
Play.

3804
04:39:13,389 --> 04:39:13,869
Let's play.

3805
04:39:14,430 --> 04:39:14,990
Play with...

3806
04:39:14,990 --> 04:39:24,590
Get attention from Vroomer.

3807
04:39:27,389 --> 04:39:28,189
What friends?

3808
04:39:28,189 --> 04:39:29,950
I'm gonna call people over and hang out.

3809
04:39:37,090 --> 04:39:38,610
Let's get a party set up.

3810
04:39:38,610 --> 04:39:41,340
You think this is a shitty grilled cheese?

3811
04:39:41,340 --> 04:39:41,659
Really?

3812
04:39:42,299 --> 04:39:43,840
I'm an asshole.

3813
04:39:43,840 --> 04:39:44,240
All right.

3814
04:39:44,240 --> 04:39:44,880
Inventory.

3815
04:39:46,799 --> 04:39:47,919
Let's get a party going.

3816
04:39:48,479 --> 04:39:51,389
Yeah.

3817
04:39:51,389 --> 04:39:52,750
I'm gonna invite everybody.

3818
04:39:52,750 --> 04:39:54,349
Lock the door and have a murder mystery.

3819
04:39:58,830 --> 04:39:59,470
But first...

3820
04:39:59,470 --> 04:40:01,790
That was a liquid grilled cheese.

3821
04:40:07,459 --> 04:40:07,700
All right.

3822
04:40:07,700 --> 04:40:08,259
Let's go.

3823
04:40:08,259 --> 04:40:08,659
Save it.

3824
04:40:09,299 --> 04:40:16,860
Who ran over the cat?

3825
04:40:16,860 --> 04:40:17,819
Nobody ran over the cat.

3826
04:40:18,380 --> 04:40:19,419
The cat is just fine.

3827
04:40:21,200 --> 04:40:22,000
Open up my phone.

3828
04:40:22,880 --> 04:40:23,840
Doctor's appointment.

3829
04:40:23,840 --> 04:40:25,040
Invite the shaman over.

3830
04:40:25,040 --> 04:40:25,279
No.

3831
04:40:26,220 --> 04:40:27,900
Travel, work, social.

3832
04:40:29,549 --> 04:40:30,909
Check media, send text.

3833
04:40:30,909 --> 04:40:32,029
Plan a social event.

3834
04:40:33,069 --> 04:40:42,139
Okay.

3835
04:40:42,139 --> 04:40:43,819
Incognito costume party.

3836
04:40:43,819 --> 04:40:44,540
Dance party.

3837
04:40:45,180 --> 04:40:45,979
House party.

3838
04:40:47,180 --> 04:40:48,139
Black and white bash.

3839
04:40:48,139 --> 04:40:49,180
Dinner party.

3840
04:40:49,180 --> 04:40:50,060
Birthday party.

3841
04:40:51,259 --> 04:40:51,819
A wedding.

3842
04:40:53,569 --> 04:40:54,689
Let's say birthday party.

3843
04:41:00,180 --> 04:41:00,900
Let's invite.

3844
04:41:00,900 --> 04:41:01,939
Click to invite someone.

3845
04:41:02,659 --> 04:41:17,009
Caterer guest.

3846
04:41:19,759 --> 04:41:20,959
I don't have any friends.

3847
04:41:46,060 --> 04:41:47,180
Ancient ruins.

3848
04:41:47,180 --> 04:41:47,900
Island bluff.

3849
04:41:50,500 --> 04:41:51,139
Invite a...

3850
04:41:51,139 --> 04:41:51,380
Yeah.

3851
04:41:51,939 --> 04:41:52,099
Yeah.

3852
04:41:52,099 --> 04:41:52,900
I don't have any friends.

3853
04:41:53,619 --> 04:41:54,669
I just don't.

3854
04:41:55,470 --> 04:41:57,979
All right.

3855
04:41:57,979 --> 04:41:58,700
Let's join a gang.

3856
04:41:59,340 --> 04:42:00,770
We have to make friends somehow.

3857
04:42:04,020 --> 04:42:04,419
Partners.

3858
04:42:04,419 --> 04:42:05,540
Call out gangs.

3859
04:42:06,349 --> 04:42:07,389
Join the thotties.

3860
04:42:07,389 --> 04:42:08,750
Enable the thotties gang.

3861
04:42:08,750 --> 04:42:11,919
Outfit for this sim.

3862
04:42:11,919 --> 04:42:15,340
Got it.

3863
04:42:15,340 --> 04:42:16,779
Let's join the thotties gang.

3864
04:42:18,189 --> 04:42:19,950
Jeremy has joined the thotties gang.

3865
04:42:19,950 --> 04:42:22,750
Jeremy will now contribute in their acts autonomously.

3866
04:42:22,750 --> 04:42:24,750
You can disable the autonomy from the mod's options.

3867
04:42:25,790 --> 04:42:29,069
Be aware members from other gangs will hunt and kill Jeremy

3868
04:42:29,069 --> 04:42:35,540
if he killed a member of their gang.

3869
04:42:35,540 --> 04:42:36,900
I have a joke.

3870
04:42:36,900 --> 04:42:37,939
Is the cat dead?

3871
04:42:39,220 --> 04:42:39,619
Okay.

3872
04:42:39,619 --> 04:42:40,180
So gang.

3873
04:42:41,439 --> 04:42:42,400
Let's see what we got here.

3874
04:42:42,400 --> 04:42:42,880
Gangs.

3875
04:42:44,689 --> 04:42:46,770
Invite the thotties gang's town.

3876
04:42:56,959 --> 04:42:58,000
Jesus Christ!

3877
04:42:58,000 --> 04:43:00,560
The thotties gang are arriving to this lot soon.

3878
04:43:00,639 --> 04:43:01,040
All right.

3879
04:43:07,650 --> 04:43:08,529
Is that a thottie?

3880
04:43:14,220 --> 04:43:14,459
What?

3881
04:43:14,459 --> 04:43:15,819
They're logging.

3882
04:43:15,819 --> 04:43:22,220
Uh-oh.

3883
04:43:24,720 --> 04:43:27,220
I don't understand.

3884
04:43:29,299 --> 04:43:31,860
Why is Red Dead Redemption 2 music playing?

3885
04:43:34,020 --> 04:43:35,139
They're all coming into town.

3886
04:43:37,200 --> 04:43:37,439
All right.

3887
04:43:37,439 --> 04:43:39,200
So they don't...

3888
04:43:39,200 --> 04:43:39,840
You're gonna stab me?

3889
04:43:39,840 --> 04:43:40,720
They're everywhere now.

3890
04:43:44,430 --> 04:43:45,310
Oh Jesus.

3891
04:43:45,310 --> 04:43:45,549
Okay.

3892
04:43:46,349 --> 04:43:47,979
What about Snuffleuficus?

3893
04:43:47,979 --> 04:43:48,860
Does he get to play too?

3894
04:43:48,860 --> 04:43:49,580
Does he get to join?

3895
04:43:54,349 --> 04:43:55,310
How do I join?

3896
04:43:55,310 --> 04:43:55,790
You join.

3897
04:43:56,509 --> 04:43:56,909
That's good.

3898
04:43:57,869 --> 04:43:58,750
What do they want me to do?

3899
04:44:08,639 --> 04:44:20,849
I just called the cops.

3900
04:44:20,849 --> 04:44:21,169
All right.

3901
04:44:21,169 --> 04:44:22,209
What's the emergency?

3902
04:44:28,220 --> 04:44:29,419
I don't understand what's happening.

3903
04:44:32,799 --> 04:44:34,959
You called the cops and now you're gonna throw money?

3904
04:44:35,680 --> 04:44:36,799
What's your emergency?

3905
04:44:36,799 --> 04:44:37,680
It's the thotties.

3906
04:44:37,680 --> 04:44:38,639
They're here.

3907
04:44:38,639 --> 04:44:39,360
Don't you see them?

3908
04:45:03,659 --> 04:45:06,220
All right.

3909
04:45:06,220 --> 04:45:08,259
Well, it's not exactly.

3910
04:45:08,259 --> 04:45:12,099
It looks like Jeremy isn't used to eating spicy food with time.

3911
04:45:12,099 --> 04:45:14,580
What do you mean I'm not used to eating spicy food?

3912
04:45:15,380 --> 04:45:24,430
All right.

3913
04:45:24,430 --> 04:45:26,750
I need to open up my fucking gang activity menu.

3914
04:45:28,639 --> 04:45:29,439
They just closed.

3915
04:45:30,080 --> 04:45:30,770
All right.

3916
04:45:30,770 --> 04:45:31,569
Where are the thotties?

3917
04:45:32,130 --> 04:45:35,139
Is this something I need to do?

3918
04:45:38,139 --> 04:45:38,860
More choices.

3919
04:45:40,110 --> 04:45:40,669
Gangs.

3920
04:45:42,590 --> 04:45:43,950
Remove from the thotties gang.

3921
04:45:46,139 --> 04:45:46,939
Pay to kill.

3922
04:45:47,580 --> 04:45:48,540
Pay to kill what?

3923
04:45:59,840 --> 04:46:00,880
It's hitman time.

3924
04:46:01,840 --> 04:46:03,360
Well, the thotties are just in town.

3925
04:46:04,000 --> 04:46:05,549
What's this?

3926
04:46:06,110 --> 04:46:09,790
What am I doing?

3927
04:46:10,750 --> 04:46:14,139
I just like strangled him for no reason.

3928
04:46:18,900 --> 04:46:19,139
What?

3929
04:46:21,500 --> 04:46:22,380
What happened to him?

3930
04:46:23,099 --> 04:46:25,979
No, no, no, no.

3931
04:46:25,979 --> 04:46:26,459
Don't leave.

3932
04:46:28,900 --> 04:46:30,259
They took his hair.

3933
04:46:31,220 --> 04:46:33,299
They grabbed his hair and ripped it off.

3934
04:46:36,240 --> 04:46:36,560
All right.

3935
04:46:36,560 --> 04:46:37,360
Fight back, dude.

3936
04:46:37,360 --> 04:46:37,599
All right.

3937
04:46:38,400 --> 04:46:39,279
Fuck this.

3938
04:46:39,279 --> 04:46:40,479
He's going to join the Vroomers.

3939
04:46:41,279 --> 04:46:45,790
Read guidebook?

3940
04:46:45,790 --> 04:46:46,029
No.

3941
04:46:50,369 --> 04:46:50,770
Gangs.

3942
04:46:52,099 --> 04:46:53,380
Join the hardwood gang.

3943
04:46:53,380 --> 04:46:54,419
Call them over.

3944
04:46:54,419 --> 04:46:58,380
Let's see where they are.

3945
04:47:00,380 --> 04:47:01,500
Invite the hardwood gang to town.

3946
04:47:09,979 --> 04:47:11,819
Vroomer has joined the hardwood gang.

3947
04:47:11,819 --> 04:47:13,099
God damn it.

3948
04:47:13,099 --> 04:47:13,419
Why?

3949
04:47:21,650 --> 04:47:22,450
This is going to get ugly.

3950
04:47:24,560 --> 04:47:25,279
What was that?

3951
04:47:25,279 --> 04:47:26,080
Is this one of them?

3952
04:47:31,299 --> 04:47:32,180
What is the noise?

3953
04:47:32,180 --> 04:47:33,139
I'm hearing noises.

3954
04:47:33,779 --> 04:47:40,909
All right.

3955
04:47:40,909 --> 04:47:42,189
This would be a gang panel.

3956
04:47:43,069 --> 04:47:55,250
Oh, somebody's going to be struck by lightning, I think.

3957
04:48:02,880 --> 04:48:04,159
Aren't these two mortal enemies?

3958
04:48:04,959 --> 04:48:08,319
Who's even out here?

3959
04:48:09,340 --> 04:48:09,979
He's sleeping.

3960
04:48:10,619 --> 04:48:11,259
Dog's fine.

3961
04:48:12,290 --> 04:48:13,169
Cat's fine.

3962
04:48:13,169 --> 04:48:13,409
Right?

3963
04:48:13,970 --> 04:48:17,310
Where am I?

3964
04:48:17,310 --> 04:48:17,630
All right.

3965
04:48:17,630 --> 04:48:18,029
I'm fine.

3966
04:48:18,750 --> 04:48:21,139
Yeah.

3967
04:48:21,139 --> 04:48:24,020
I'm just giving like I'm saying hello to all my fellow gang members.

3968
04:48:25,860 --> 04:48:38,939
This is the lamest gang fight I've ever seen.

3969
04:48:44,740 --> 04:48:45,380
Who's this?

3970
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:47,779
There's a guy with an umbrella just keeps walking by.

3971
04:48:47,779 --> 04:48:48,580
I have a bat now.

3972
04:48:49,299 --> 04:48:54,270
Oh, she's gone.

3973
04:49:03,180 --> 04:49:04,720
All right.

3974
04:49:04,720 --> 04:49:05,040
Gang.

3975
04:49:06,400 --> 04:49:14,740
Jesus.

3976
04:49:14,740 --> 04:49:15,779
That thunder.

3977
04:49:15,779 --> 04:49:20,319
Can one of you...

3978
04:49:20,319 --> 04:49:22,080
Can one of my boys stand up for me here?

3979
04:49:39,419 --> 04:49:39,740
Is this...

3980
04:49:39,740 --> 04:49:58,290
It's the genie.

3981
04:49:59,869 --> 04:50:00,909
It's the genie.

3982
04:50:03,569 --> 04:50:04,369
Is it the genie?

3983
04:50:13,169 --> 04:50:14,529
What's the dog out here?

3984
04:50:16,290 --> 04:50:16,610
All right.

3985
04:50:16,610 --> 04:50:17,490
Retaliation.

3986
04:50:41,069 --> 04:50:45,220
Can somebody else fight back?

3987
04:50:45,220 --> 04:50:47,580
Somebody has to fight back.

3988
04:50:47,580 --> 04:50:49,259
I'm hearing people getting hit by bats.

3989
04:51:00,159 --> 04:51:01,360
Where the fuck did you come from?

3990
04:51:01,919 --> 04:51:03,709
Like I got instant muscles.

3991
04:51:10,939 --> 04:51:11,819
Is this the genie?

3992
04:51:13,119 --> 04:51:14,240
Is this the genie?

3993
04:51:14,240 --> 04:51:15,759
I don't know if this is the genie or not.

3994
04:51:22,259 --> 04:51:23,459
Fame and reputation.

3995
04:51:24,560 --> 04:51:26,080
Who the fuck are you?

3996
04:51:28,060 --> 04:51:29,419
Who is this person?

3997
04:51:30,060 --> 04:51:31,979
Why is there a golden cowboy?

3998
04:51:33,259 --> 04:51:34,619
Has anybody figured this out?

3999
04:51:36,799 --> 04:51:38,000
Golden cowboy.

4000
04:51:38,799 --> 04:51:45,500
Funny introduction.

4001
04:51:45,500 --> 04:51:46,380
I need to know this person.

4002
04:51:48,849 --> 04:51:49,729
I need to know this person.

4003
04:51:49,729 --> 04:51:51,009
I need to hang out with this person right now.

4004
04:51:52,290 --> 04:51:53,009
Please be a friend.

4005
04:51:53,729 --> 04:52:02,700
There's a knife in my hand.

4006
04:52:02,700 --> 04:52:02,939
All right.

4007
04:52:02,939 --> 04:52:03,419
Forget it.

4008
04:52:03,419 --> 04:52:03,740
Stop.

4009
04:52:03,740 --> 04:52:03,979
Stop.

4010
04:52:03,979 --> 04:52:04,139
Stop.

4011
04:52:04,139 --> 04:52:04,380
Stop.

4012
04:52:04,380 --> 04:52:06,220
I want to be friends with the golden cowboy.

4013
04:52:07,099 --> 04:52:10,290
Share...

4014
04:52:11,250 --> 04:52:15,459
Why is he asleep?

4015
04:52:17,139 --> 04:52:26,689
Oh my god.

4016
04:52:26,689 --> 04:52:28,450
Can we get rid of them so they stop crying?

4017
04:52:35,099 --> 04:52:36,189
He's back.

4018
04:52:36,189 --> 04:52:37,549
He's got his hair back too.

4019
04:52:37,549 --> 04:52:38,029
He's fine.

4020
04:52:38,909 --> 04:52:41,380
That guy also has a gun.

4021
04:52:42,259 --> 04:52:44,930
Don't ask me why that person has a gun in their hand.

4022
04:52:48,580 --> 04:52:55,569
Are we just going to continuously cry?

4023
04:53:04,259 --> 04:53:05,139
Oh my god.

4024
04:53:06,419 --> 04:53:07,139
All right.

4025
04:53:07,139 --> 04:53:07,540
Enough.

4026
04:53:08,500 --> 04:53:10,860
Enough.

4027
04:53:11,580 --> 04:53:14,619
Make friends with this weird golden cowboy, please.

4028
04:53:15,580 --> 04:53:23,380
What are you doing?

4029
04:53:24,459 --> 04:53:26,220
Witness gang murder.

4030
04:53:26,220 --> 04:53:26,380
No.

4031
04:53:27,419 --> 04:53:28,700
I want this guy's phone number.

4032
04:53:30,060 --> 04:53:30,779
What are you...

4033
04:53:30,779 --> 04:53:31,419
Excuse me.

4034
04:53:33,250 --> 04:53:34,049
What happened?

4035
04:53:41,069 --> 04:53:42,590
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4036
04:53:42,590 --> 04:53:43,869
No, no, no, no.

4037
04:53:43,869 --> 04:53:46,720
No, please.

4038
04:53:47,520 --> 04:53:48,400
Just talk.

4039
04:53:50,080 --> 04:53:52,240
I just need to get his phone number.

4040
04:53:52,240 --> 04:53:53,759
I don't care about anything else.

4041
04:53:53,759 --> 04:53:54,720
Holy shit.

4042
04:53:58,479 --> 04:53:59,439
No, stop.

4043
04:54:03,009 --> 04:54:03,889
Anybody out here that...

4044
04:54:12,029 --> 04:54:13,389
Stop running home.

4045
04:54:14,110 --> 04:54:15,310
Oh, you're the worst.

4046
04:54:20,830 --> 04:54:21,150
Chat.

4047
04:54:22,590 --> 04:54:22,909
Chat.

4048
04:54:25,259 --> 04:54:26,139
I'm both fucking...

4049
04:54:27,819 --> 04:54:32,029
I just want his name.

4050
04:54:32,590 --> 04:54:33,599
Just want his name.

4051
04:54:36,029 --> 04:54:37,229
Okay, here we go.

4052
04:54:37,229 --> 04:54:37,470
Chat.

4053
04:54:39,459 --> 04:54:40,340
Go over there.

4054
04:54:42,500 --> 04:54:43,220
What are you doing?

4055
04:54:47,540 --> 04:54:49,459
Don't give me money and run.

4056
04:54:49,459 --> 04:54:51,860
Oh my god, you fucking little asshole.

4057
04:54:51,860 --> 04:54:52,180
Wait.

4058
04:54:53,139 --> 04:54:53,540
Wait.

4059
04:55:00,349 --> 04:55:01,069
Fuck you then.

4060
04:55:18,459 --> 04:55:19,580
I don't know who these people are.

4061
04:55:20,299 --> 04:55:23,819
He got away.

4062
04:55:23,819 --> 04:55:25,180
Where was I ever going to find him again?

4063
04:55:30,959 --> 04:55:32,639
I let the treasure goblin get away.

4064
04:55:33,860 --> 04:55:35,860
I'm not killing this person anymore.

4065
04:55:38,819 --> 04:55:39,220
All right.

4066
04:55:39,220 --> 04:55:42,099
It's time for you to cut the shit and have a part.

4067
04:55:42,099 --> 04:55:42,900
Did I meet anybody?

4068
04:55:44,400 --> 04:55:46,400
I need to see if I chat with...

4069
04:55:49,409 --> 04:55:49,729
There you go.

4070
04:55:49,729 --> 04:55:50,450
I met one person.

4071
04:55:51,090 --> 04:55:57,340
I need to make friends.

4072
04:55:58,060 --> 04:56:04,830
What are you doing here?

4073
04:56:04,830 --> 04:56:08,689
Why is death here?

4074
04:56:33,459 --> 04:56:35,540
I just made him gain some weight.

4075
04:56:36,500 --> 04:56:37,459
Bark at.

4076
04:57:17,380 --> 04:57:20,900
Okay, so something we need to remember here is somebody...

4077
04:57:22,340 --> 04:57:23,299
That was fucking weird.

4078
04:57:25,099 --> 04:57:26,939
The girl was killed in here.

4079
04:57:26,939 --> 04:57:31,099
Let's keep moving here.

4080
04:57:31,099 --> 04:57:31,580
Can I move?

4081
04:57:32,220 --> 04:57:33,259
No, not with him.

4082
04:57:33,900 --> 04:57:36,020
At least you're having fun.

4083
04:57:36,020 --> 04:57:37,220
Can somebody clean this up?

4084
04:57:37,860 --> 04:57:45,709
Okay, so who...

4085
04:57:46,830 --> 04:57:48,750
You guys, both you two are still alive, so that's good.

4086
04:57:49,389 --> 04:57:50,750
I'm okay with this.

4087
04:57:53,299 --> 04:57:54,340
Death killed somebody.

4088
04:57:54,340 --> 04:57:54,900
No, no, no, no.

4089
04:58:04,020 --> 04:58:06,349
What are you doing with that gun?

4090
04:58:10,319 --> 04:58:10,799
Who is this?

4091
04:58:11,520 --> 04:58:18,080
He was going to shoot me and then he realized how bad I smelled and his AI fucked up.

4092
04:58:18,080 --> 04:58:35,330
I've got to get in front of it.

4093
04:58:35,970 --> 04:58:52,299
Can I go home now?

4094
04:58:57,250 --> 04:58:57,810
You smell something?

4095
04:58:57,810 --> 04:58:59,009
He thought I was already dead, yeah.

4096
04:59:02,540 --> 04:59:03,900
Why am I still dressed like this?

4097
04:59:03,900 --> 04:59:04,939
Why am I still doing this?

4098
04:59:05,659 --> 04:59:10,560
Why are people glowing?

4099
04:59:10,560 --> 04:59:13,439
Because I enabled world peace from the genie,

4100
04:59:14,240 --> 04:59:16,000
which I'm not even sure the genie exists anymore.

4101
04:59:16,000 --> 04:59:17,360
Does somebody free the genie?

4102
04:59:26,659 --> 04:59:28,099
World peace sure didn't work.

4103
04:59:28,819 --> 04:59:38,830
Get out of here.

4104
04:59:38,830 --> 04:59:39,069
Home.

4105
04:59:40,029 --> 04:59:43,650
Stop dancing and go home.

4106
04:59:43,650 --> 04:59:44,849
How do I leave the gang?

4107
04:59:46,130 --> 04:59:50,979
You just can't get over a tenure.

4108
04:59:51,619 --> 04:59:56,270
I did a great job upholding the world peace.

4109
04:59:56,270 --> 04:59:58,430
I'm gonna be honest with you.

4110
04:59:59,150 --> 05:00:03,299
I didn't mean to do anything.

4111
05:00:03,299 --> 05:00:03,619
They just...

4112
05:00:05,540 --> 05:00:06,740
I did like the gang fight.

4113
05:00:10,419 --> 05:00:11,700
You can't actually do this, can you?

4114
05:00:22,209 --> 05:00:24,189
What are you doing out here?

4115
05:00:24,990 --> 05:00:28,080
Why does everybody keep leaving the house?

4116
05:00:31,700 --> 05:00:32,900
I need to know what you're doing out here.

4117
05:00:32,900 --> 05:00:33,540
Let's follow you.

4118
05:00:40,000 --> 05:00:40,240
And?

4119
05:00:40,959 --> 05:00:44,819
What are you doing?

4120
05:00:44,819 --> 05:00:47,250
Is it the person that's walking towards me?

4121
05:00:47,889 --> 05:00:54,580
That was a huge strike of lightning.

4122
05:00:59,139 --> 05:01:00,099
I'm gonna sit here and watch.

4123
05:01:00,979 --> 05:01:03,310
This is kind of concerning.

4124
05:01:06,750 --> 05:01:08,830
You know the umbrella is supposed to stay up.

4125
05:01:09,549 --> 05:01:15,389
That's the banana.

4126
05:01:16,029 --> 05:01:18,419
We're getting a crossover episode here.

4127
05:01:42,479 --> 05:01:44,080
I came all the way over here just to do that.

4128
05:01:48,689 --> 05:01:49,409
I don't like this.

4129
05:01:55,310 --> 05:01:57,150
And now he's very sad.

4130
05:02:06,900 --> 05:02:07,619
Very sad.

4131
05:02:07,619 --> 05:02:08,340
What's your problem?

4132
05:02:10,049 --> 05:02:10,930
Social talk.

4133
05:02:10,930 --> 05:02:11,569
Meet some friends.

4134
05:02:11,569 --> 05:02:12,529
I need to have a party.

4135
05:02:20,750 --> 05:02:22,349
I apparently punched this guy in the face.

4136
05:02:34,130 --> 05:02:38,740
I walked over punched him in the face and then

4137
05:02:39,380 --> 05:02:41,299
fell asleep on the bench apparently.

4138
05:02:42,860 --> 05:02:44,700
But why wouldn't you just go to bed?

4139
05:02:47,380 --> 05:02:47,619
What?

4140
05:02:52,349 --> 05:02:52,669
Why?

4141
05:02:58,909 --> 05:03:00,830
Eight is running away?

4142
05:03:00,830 --> 05:03:01,470
Hold on.

4143
05:03:01,470 --> 05:03:02,430
Who's running away?

4144
05:03:03,150 --> 05:03:04,349
Eight is running away?

4145
05:03:05,310 --> 05:03:08,610
But posting an alert via computer or a phone can help find.

4146
05:03:08,610 --> 05:03:09,650
What do you mean find her?

4147
05:03:10,450 --> 05:03:10,770
Where?

4148
05:03:10,770 --> 05:03:11,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4149
05:03:17,979 --> 05:03:18,779
Don't leave.

4150
05:03:22,860 --> 05:03:24,139
No, no, no, no, no.

4151
05:03:27,299 --> 05:03:27,619
Stop.

4152
05:03:27,619 --> 05:03:28,340
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

4153
05:03:28,340 --> 05:03:28,500
You.

4154
05:03:28,500 --> 05:03:29,459
You're out here.

4155
05:03:29,459 --> 05:03:30,020
Go get her.

4156
05:03:30,900 --> 05:03:31,619
Right now.

4157
05:03:31,619 --> 05:03:32,340
Stop what you're doing.

4158
05:03:33,060 --> 05:03:37,040
Where's the fucking cat?

4159
05:03:37,040 --> 05:03:37,439
Where is she?

4160
05:03:38,159 --> 05:03:38,720
All right there.

4161
05:03:39,360 --> 05:03:40,080
You.

4162
05:03:40,080 --> 05:03:40,560
Go get her.

4163
05:03:41,279 --> 05:03:47,090
Take to the bed.

4164
05:03:49,580 --> 05:03:50,060
Get over there.

4165
05:03:50,060 --> 05:03:50,459
Hurry up.

4166
05:03:51,020 --> 05:03:52,060
Don't let her run away.

4167
05:03:55,650 --> 05:03:56,130
Come on.

4168
05:03:57,520 --> 05:03:57,919
Quickly.

4169
05:03:58,720 --> 05:03:59,680
Don't let her get away.

4170
05:04:00,560 --> 05:04:03,169
How do I run?

4171
05:04:05,740 --> 05:04:07,099
Run, run, run.

4172
05:04:07,979 --> 05:04:10,580
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

4173
05:04:10,580 --> 05:04:11,459
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4174
05:04:11,459 --> 05:04:11,860
Go over here.

4175
05:04:15,119 --> 05:04:15,599
Over here.

4176
05:04:17,180 --> 05:04:18,220
No, sit here.

4177
05:04:18,220 --> 05:04:20,060
Lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down.

4178
05:04:21,419 --> 05:04:22,779
Get the fuck over there.

4179
05:04:26,830 --> 05:04:27,310
Come on.

4180
05:04:28,029 --> 05:04:31,310
Come on.

4181
05:04:33,150 --> 05:04:34,349
Where the fuck are you?

4182
05:04:34,990 --> 05:04:35,470
Where is he?

4183
05:04:36,270 --> 05:04:38,110
Hurry up.

4184
05:04:45,459 --> 05:04:46,419
He's just strolling there.

4185
05:04:48,340 --> 05:04:48,740
Wait.

4186
05:04:48,740 --> 05:04:49,299
Hey, hey.

4187
05:04:51,069 --> 05:04:51,389
Who's?

4188
05:04:53,119 --> 05:04:53,759
Back up.

4189
05:04:53,759 --> 05:04:54,000
No, no, no.

4190
05:04:54,000 --> 05:04:54,560
Wait, wait, wait.

4191
05:04:54,560 --> 05:04:54,720
My.

4192
05:04:55,360 --> 05:05:07,950
I'm just taking drugs.

4193
05:05:07,950 --> 05:05:08,509
Where am I?

4194
05:05:09,150 --> 05:05:19,979
Oh my God.

4195
05:05:19,979 --> 05:05:20,779
You're so dumb.

4196
05:05:21,580 --> 05:05:23,259
Go pick up the cat.

4197
05:05:25,069 --> 05:05:25,310
Go.

4198
05:05:34,909 --> 05:05:35,709
What are you doing?

4199
05:05:36,349 --> 05:05:37,470
Why are you not paying?

4200
05:05:50,459 --> 05:05:52,700
Pick up the cat.

4201
05:05:52,700 --> 05:05:53,419
Pick up the cat.

4202
05:05:57,939 --> 05:05:58,740
Pick up the cat.

4203
05:05:59,790 --> 05:06:01,310
Put the bat away now.

4204
05:06:01,869 --> 05:06:03,229
Put the bat away right fucking now.

4205
05:06:03,229 --> 05:06:04,110
Pick this cat up now.

4206
05:06:04,909 --> 05:06:06,819
Don't you dare.

4207
05:06:15,889 --> 05:06:17,330
Why would you yell at the cat?

4208
05:06:18,740 --> 05:06:19,619
What are you doing?

4209
05:06:20,740 --> 05:06:21,860
It's so bad.

4210
05:06:24,349 --> 05:06:27,549
Hey, don't beep for your shell.

4211
05:06:28,110 --> 05:06:29,470
What the hell is wrong with you?

4212
05:06:32,669 --> 05:06:33,709
Rumor is mean.

4213
05:06:33,709 --> 05:06:36,430
Mean Sims become happy when they say mean things to other Sims.

4214
05:06:39,860 --> 05:06:40,419
What's wrong?

4215
05:06:51,340 --> 05:06:51,580
Okay.

4216
05:06:53,950 --> 05:06:54,430
Comfort.

4217
05:06:57,680 --> 05:06:58,799
Take cat to the vet.

4218
05:07:00,220 --> 05:07:00,700
All right.

4219
05:07:00,700 --> 05:07:01,580
We're good now.

4220
05:07:01,580 --> 05:07:02,220
Everything's fine.

4221
05:07:03,340 --> 05:07:04,139
All right.

4222
05:07:04,139 --> 05:07:04,540
Go home.

4223
05:07:05,740 --> 05:07:08,369
Time to go home.

4224
05:07:10,909 --> 05:07:11,150
No.

4225
05:07:11,150 --> 05:07:11,630
Take it to the vet.

4226
05:07:14,669 --> 05:07:20,180
Time for vet.

4227
05:07:20,180 --> 05:07:21,139
Bring to vet now.

4228
05:07:22,580 --> 05:07:23,299
Okay.

4229
05:07:23,299 --> 05:07:24,020
Thank God.

4230
05:07:25,790 --> 05:07:27,069
Traveling to the vet.

4231
05:07:27,069 --> 05:07:27,630
Where's the vet?

4232
05:07:28,270 --> 05:07:42,110
Is it that different world?

4233
05:07:42,909 --> 05:07:54,080
Can we leave the Brindledon Bay to the vet?

4234
05:07:54,720 --> 05:07:59,299
It's the Wharf Vet Clinic.

4235
05:08:01,099 --> 05:08:01,500
Let's go.

4236
05:08:02,299 --> 05:08:13,790
I've got a cat here.

4237
05:08:14,669 --> 05:08:15,950
I need some.

4238
05:08:15,950 --> 05:08:16,669
I got a cat.

4239
05:08:20,479 --> 05:08:20,720
Okay.

4240
05:08:21,540 --> 05:08:22,099
Let's go in.

4241
05:08:28,290 --> 05:08:29,250
Can you treat my cat?

4242
05:08:29,810 --> 05:08:35,040
Why am I walking like this?

4243
05:08:40,220 --> 05:08:41,500
What is that dog?

4244
05:08:46,099 --> 05:08:46,500
Okay.

4245
05:08:50,060 --> 05:08:51,740
This is liquid.

4246
05:08:51,740 --> 05:08:52,700
Liquid diarrhea.

4247
05:08:53,259 --> 05:09:25,439
Am I taking money from the register?

4248
05:09:25,439 --> 05:09:25,680
No.

4249
05:09:31,020 --> 05:09:31,340
Okay.

4250
05:09:31,340 --> 05:09:32,139
I'm fine.

4251
05:09:32,139 --> 05:09:36,669
So I don't give a shit about the cat that's out there.

4252
05:09:45,779 --> 05:09:46,180
Coffee.

4253
05:09:47,220 --> 05:09:47,860
Okay.

4254
05:09:47,860 --> 05:09:50,819
What about that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer dog?

4255
05:09:56,819 --> 05:09:57,939
I'm not supposed to be in here.

4256
05:10:10,529 --> 05:10:11,409
Why am I in here?

4257
05:10:17,419 --> 05:10:18,139
Is he spraying?

4258
05:10:18,139 --> 05:10:18,779
Spray painting?

4259
05:10:19,419 --> 05:10:20,619
What is on my gun?

4260
05:10:21,659 --> 05:10:22,060
What?

4261
05:10:24,369 --> 05:10:25,970
What was my gun?

4262
05:10:25,970 --> 05:10:27,729
The wallpaper of the bathroom.

4263
05:10:37,819 --> 05:10:38,139
Why?

4264
05:10:38,939 --> 05:10:39,259
What?

4265
05:10:39,900 --> 05:10:41,419
What are you doing?

4266
05:10:41,419 --> 05:10:41,979
Why?

4267
05:10:45,060 --> 05:10:45,380
What?

4268
05:10:48,419 --> 05:10:49,380
What on earth?

4269
05:10:50,020 --> 05:10:51,939
Somebody please help my cat.

4270
05:10:54,720 --> 05:10:56,479
Why would you do this?

4271
05:10:58,159 --> 05:10:59,439
Unfucking believable.

4272
05:11:04,459 --> 05:11:05,500
This is so sad.

4273
05:11:06,299 --> 05:11:07,090
What do I hear?

4274
05:11:07,090 --> 05:11:07,810
Alien sounds.

4275
05:11:08,369 --> 05:11:10,029
Hello?

4276
05:11:10,830 --> 05:11:15,900
Oh, this is the worst.

4277
05:11:17,919 --> 05:11:18,799
I need treatment.

4278
05:11:18,799 --> 05:11:19,200
Please.

4279
05:11:20,000 --> 05:11:21,439
Treat me.

4280
05:11:22,240 --> 05:11:24,639
Treat me.

4281
05:11:25,279 --> 05:11:28,819
That's got another cup of coffee.

4282
05:11:52,450 --> 05:11:54,209
The thing in the front desk?

4283
05:11:54,209 --> 05:11:55,009
Oh shit.

4284
05:11:55,009 --> 05:11:55,330
Okay.

4285
05:11:56,880 --> 05:11:58,400
Sign 8 in for curing.

4286
05:11:58,400 --> 05:12:00,240
Sign 8 in for a spay.

4287
05:12:07,060 --> 05:12:08,419
Death is hitting on somebody over there.

4288
05:12:13,099 --> 05:12:14,299
He's gonna do it again.

4289
05:12:14,299 --> 05:12:16,060
No, I'm gonna prevent that from happening.

4290
05:12:16,700 --> 05:12:19,970
A vet will be with you soon to examine and treat your sick pet.

4291
05:12:19,970 --> 05:12:20,689
Please be patient.

4292
05:12:27,630 --> 05:12:28,029
So where's...

4293
05:12:30,779 --> 05:12:31,740
Get pet examined.

4294
05:12:33,259 --> 05:12:34,299
Who's examining the pet?

4295
05:12:35,259 --> 05:12:38,349
Oh, he's going up there now.

4296
05:12:38,349 --> 05:12:38,590
Okay.

4297
05:12:39,389 --> 05:12:45,040
Of course, the vet.

4298
05:12:46,080 --> 05:12:46,959
Has cat ears.

4299
05:12:48,130 --> 05:12:48,369
Really?

4300
05:12:51,409 --> 05:12:52,049
Are you serious?

4301
05:13:03,869 --> 05:13:04,430
Pet examined.

4302
05:13:04,430 --> 05:13:07,470
Looks like 8 has woozy-kiddiitis.

4303
05:13:07,470 --> 05:13:08,990
Which option would you like to have?

4304
05:13:10,450 --> 05:13:11,250
Expensive treatment.

4305
05:13:11,250 --> 05:13:14,130
Spare no expense and cure your pet with the best medicine available.

4306
05:13:16,159 --> 05:13:19,939
I'm so used to seeing dogs, man.

4307
05:13:21,979 --> 05:13:22,380
All right.

4308
05:13:23,540 --> 05:13:24,659
Back to normal.

4309
05:13:24,659 --> 05:13:26,700
We're good.

4310
05:13:28,049 --> 05:13:28,610
Thank you.

4311
05:13:32,750 --> 05:13:33,470
Back to normal.

4312
05:13:38,450 --> 05:13:39,250
All right.

4313
05:13:39,250 --> 05:13:40,130
We can go home now.

4314
05:13:41,009 --> 05:13:44,299
What's the sad music for?

4315
05:13:45,419 --> 05:13:46,060
What's going on?

4316
05:13:48,930 --> 05:13:49,729
Sad music.

4317
05:13:53,919 --> 05:13:54,959
That was kind of scary.

4318
05:13:57,520 --> 05:13:58,400
You got one too.

4319
05:13:58,400 --> 05:13:58,720
Okay.

4320
05:13:59,439 --> 05:14:00,000
Both armed.

4321
05:14:05,950 --> 05:14:07,709
Wait, death just got arrested?

4322
05:14:19,020 --> 05:14:20,459
I don't even know what that was.

4323
05:14:20,619 --> 05:14:21,680
What about the kitty?

4324
05:14:24,130 --> 05:14:24,930
No, stop.

4325
05:14:25,970 --> 05:14:26,770
Stop, stop it.

4326
05:14:39,169 --> 05:14:40,689
The dog is just like here.

4327
05:14:48,209 --> 05:14:50,419
How do I get him out of jail?

4328
05:14:54,340 --> 05:14:56,259
You're going to jump up and eat the treats?

4329
05:15:03,500 --> 05:15:04,779
I'm going to get him out of jail.

4330
05:15:04,779 --> 05:15:05,740
I'm going to get him out of jail.

4331
05:15:05,740 --> 05:15:06,700
I'm going to get him out of jail.

4332
05:15:06,700 --> 05:15:17,779
I can't.

4333
05:15:18,580 --> 05:15:19,139
I can't.

4334
05:15:20,819 --> 05:15:21,619
No, I can't.

4335
05:15:38,400 --> 05:15:39,439
I have to stop that.

4336
05:15:39,439 --> 05:15:40,400
I have to stop that.

4337
05:15:41,200 --> 05:15:42,400
I have to stop that joke.

4338
05:15:42,400 --> 05:15:43,040
It's not...

4339
05:15:43,040 --> 05:15:44,159
We did it too many times.

4340
05:15:45,200 --> 05:15:46,799
I've done that too many times.

4341
05:15:48,500 --> 05:15:50,259
There are no more vets.

4342
05:15:53,729 --> 05:15:54,290
All right.

4343
05:15:54,290 --> 05:15:54,689
All right.

4344
05:15:54,689 --> 05:15:55,889
No, it's not funny anymore.

4345
05:15:55,889 --> 05:15:56,209
I'm out.

4346
05:15:56,209 --> 05:15:56,930
Get me out of here.

4347
05:15:56,930 --> 05:15:57,650
Go home.

4348
05:15:57,650 --> 05:16:05,250
Why is he taking a picture?

4349
05:16:07,310 --> 05:16:08,509
Does the cat know how to go home?

4350
05:16:09,069 --> 05:16:14,529
It's going to arrest the cat.

4351
05:16:16,130 --> 05:16:17,330
No, you can't arrest the cat.

4352
05:16:39,279 --> 05:16:40,720
I need to get this cat back home.

4353
05:16:42,000 --> 05:16:43,979
But nobody can...

4354
05:16:43,979 --> 05:16:45,099
Somebody's going to pick the cat up.

4355
05:16:46,380 --> 05:16:47,900
I'm in a different world right now.

4356
05:16:48,700 --> 05:16:52,590
What's Jerma doing?

4357
05:16:52,590 --> 05:16:54,110
I don't know, but at home.

4358
05:16:55,569 --> 05:16:57,250
Okay, you need to come get this cat.

4359
05:16:59,950 --> 05:17:01,060
Stop shooting.

4360
05:17:01,860 --> 05:17:03,220
Oh, this is bad.

4361
05:17:03,220 --> 05:17:03,700
Why am I...

4362
05:17:04,580 --> 05:17:06,979
What was that?

4363
05:17:07,700 --> 05:17:09,939
Am I covered in blood?

4364
05:17:13,409 --> 05:17:14,689
Is death going to take my cat?

4365
05:17:20,659 --> 05:17:25,860
I need to get you home.

4366
05:17:29,490 --> 05:17:30,849
That's a bad idea.

4367
05:17:30,849 --> 05:17:31,729
Don't attack death.

4368
05:17:34,880 --> 05:17:35,599
All right, go.

4369
05:17:36,479 --> 05:17:40,610
Let's focus on switch control.

4370
05:17:43,869 --> 05:17:45,150
I got to pull that cat back.

4371
05:17:45,709 --> 05:17:57,889
All right.

4372
05:17:57,889 --> 05:17:59,580
Cat, call over.

4373
05:18:02,689 --> 05:18:05,790
The cat brought two friends, I guess.

4374
05:18:07,729 --> 05:18:08,130
All right.

4375
05:18:08,770 --> 05:18:09,569
Invite over.

4376
05:18:11,650 --> 05:18:12,689
Funny introduction.

4377
05:18:12,689 --> 05:18:13,490
Welcome to the house.

4378
05:18:14,209 --> 05:18:17,619
It's time to have a party.

4379
05:18:18,259 --> 05:18:20,720
How do I get you out of jail?

4380
05:18:20,720 --> 05:18:24,319
How are you still at the hospital?

4381
05:18:37,169 --> 05:18:37,650
Where is he?

4382
05:18:49,500 --> 05:18:51,580
On the computer at the vet's.

4383
05:18:55,419 --> 05:18:56,299
We got two more vets.

4384
05:18:56,299 --> 05:18:56,619
We're good.

4385
05:19:02,180 --> 05:19:02,900
Cat is home.

4386
05:19:02,900 --> 05:19:03,700
Everyone's home.

4387
05:19:03,700 --> 05:19:04,740
Time for you to go home, too.

4388
05:19:12,459 --> 05:19:13,740
He's about to make a coffee again.

4389
05:19:18,159 --> 05:19:19,040
Oh, my God.

4390
05:19:22,540 --> 05:19:24,380
No, just get out of here.

4391
05:19:25,099 --> 05:19:31,819
Just make your exit.

4392
05:19:37,279 --> 05:19:37,599
Home.

4393
05:19:38,400 --> 05:19:38,880
Goodbye.

4394
05:19:40,000 --> 05:19:42,139
All right.

4395
05:19:42,139 --> 05:19:43,340
Thank you for treating my animal.

4396
05:19:44,799 --> 05:19:45,599
Let's get control.

4397
05:19:46,159 --> 05:19:49,229
Let's switch control to Jeremy Reinhardt.

4398
05:20:00,099 --> 05:20:00,740
All right.

4399
05:20:00,740 --> 05:20:05,659
The pets are doing just fine.

4400
05:20:06,619 --> 05:20:07,340
Everyone's okay.

4401
05:20:07,340 --> 05:20:07,740
Let's check.

4402
05:20:07,740 --> 05:20:09,180
Let's actually check on traits here.

4403
05:20:09,180 --> 05:20:10,220
Let's make some food.

4404
05:20:11,459 --> 05:20:12,419
Enough with the bullshit.

4405
05:20:13,380 --> 05:20:15,659
Let's make some food.

4406
05:20:15,659 --> 05:20:19,229
I don't know who this is,

4407
05:20:22,580 --> 05:20:24,259
but they are currently in my house.

4408
05:20:24,819 --> 05:20:33,810
Oh, you're watching the people burn and fires video again, right?

4409
05:20:33,810 --> 05:20:34,290
That's great.

4410
05:20:36,479 --> 05:20:37,759
I guess I'm going to introduce myself.

4411
05:20:44,930 --> 05:20:46,130
How did the Grim Reaper die?

4412
05:20:49,299 --> 05:20:49,799
What?

4413
05:20:53,599 --> 05:20:55,279
Somebody killed the Grim Reaper in here.

4414
05:21:00,750 --> 05:21:01,549
Go home.

4415
05:21:08,270 --> 05:21:08,770
All right.

4416
05:21:09,950 --> 05:21:10,430
Hungry.

4417
05:21:10,430 --> 05:21:11,869
It's time to make food.

4418
05:21:15,009 --> 05:21:15,509
Cook.

4419
05:21:16,340 --> 05:21:16,819
A meal.

4420
05:21:16,819 --> 05:21:17,939
I already have a party here.

4421
05:21:17,939 --> 05:21:18,659
Hire staff.

4422
05:21:19,619 --> 05:21:22,369
Cook a grand meal.

4423
05:21:22,369 --> 05:21:24,930
I'm going to make a turkey dinner.

4424
05:21:35,360 --> 05:21:36,880
Nice things are happening, I guess.

4425
05:21:36,880 --> 05:21:43,970
Tofurky.

4426
05:21:43,970 --> 05:21:45,409
Wait, what the hell is Tofurky?

4427
05:21:46,049 --> 05:21:48,560
I have no clue.

4428
05:21:51,279 --> 05:21:52,080
That's all you need to do.

4429
05:21:53,090 --> 05:21:56,900
First to die, just kill somebody.

4430
05:21:56,900 --> 05:21:57,400
What?

4431
05:22:01,330 --> 05:22:01,830
Why?

4432
05:22:14,770 --> 05:22:17,810
Technically, he was first to die.

4433
05:22:26,900 --> 05:22:35,869
He was out of control.

4434
05:22:35,869 --> 05:22:36,369
He was.

4435
05:22:43,139 --> 05:22:46,110
All right.

4436
05:22:46,110 --> 05:22:48,189
Can I make a grand meal, please?

4437
05:23:00,299 --> 05:23:01,020
Okay, can we...

4438
05:23:02,959 --> 05:23:04,240
Don't forget about the Tofurky.

4439
05:23:04,240 --> 05:23:04,740
Right.

4440
05:23:04,959 --> 05:23:05,840
I was going to say, why?

4441
05:23:13,150 --> 05:23:14,270
Get out of the turkey.

4442
05:23:15,220 --> 05:23:16,099
I can't even click it.

4443
05:23:18,319 --> 05:23:18,819
Resume.

4444
05:23:20,099 --> 05:23:20,659
Turkey dinner.

4445
05:23:26,669 --> 05:23:27,869
Are you eating out of the bowl?

4446
05:23:34,290 --> 05:23:35,169
This is so cute.

4447
05:23:36,770 --> 05:23:37,810
It really is.

4448
05:23:37,810 --> 05:23:39,169
This is absolutely adorable.

4449
05:23:45,889 --> 05:23:47,169
And what was the photo?

4450
05:23:47,169 --> 05:23:48,290
Did I add money?

4451
05:23:49,009 --> 05:23:50,700
I think I put money in here.

4452
05:23:51,419 --> 05:23:55,009
My secret ingredient is money.

4453
05:24:09,700 --> 05:24:10,819
This is not a turkey.

4454
05:24:14,139 --> 05:24:15,020
At all.

4455
05:24:15,020 --> 05:24:16,380
This is a bowl of tomato.

4456
05:24:17,259 --> 05:24:17,900
Paste.

4457
05:24:17,900 --> 05:24:18,400
And that's it.

4458
05:24:23,099 --> 05:24:24,380
It's tofu turkey.

4459
05:24:25,860 --> 05:24:26,360
Really?

4460
05:24:29,500 --> 05:24:30,220
Oh, what?

4461
05:24:30,779 --> 05:24:31,279
Okay.

4462
05:24:31,900 --> 05:24:37,389
You can turn the oven on?

4463
05:24:38,270 --> 05:24:40,080
That's not how you turn an oven on.

4464
05:24:40,799 --> 05:24:42,159
It is a notch on the top right.

4465
05:24:43,119 --> 05:24:45,020
I just threw a lime in there.

4466
05:24:49,979 --> 05:24:50,619
Turn on the oven.

4467
05:24:56,819 --> 05:24:57,459
It's already on.

4468
05:24:58,259 --> 05:24:58,759
Okay.

4469
05:25:05,330 --> 05:25:06,990
So it looks pretty good.

4470
05:25:06,990 --> 05:25:07,490
Yeah, it does.

4471
05:25:09,950 --> 05:25:11,470
Did somebody just throw a glass at me?

4472
05:25:12,830 --> 05:25:13,790
What the fuck was that?

4473
05:25:19,729 --> 05:25:20,229
There it is.

4474
05:25:23,200 --> 05:25:24,000
Who's hungry?

4475
05:25:24,639 --> 05:25:28,639
I've got a Tufurki dinner.

4476
05:25:47,389 --> 05:25:49,229
I killed the vegetarian.

4477
05:25:54,659 --> 05:25:56,180
Did I actually kill the vegetarian?

4478
05:25:56,819 --> 05:26:01,380
I'm just sitting down.

4479
05:26:04,580 --> 05:26:05,619
Where's Doug?

4480
05:26:07,380 --> 05:26:14,509
I think me and death are having a flirty conversation.

4481
05:26:18,860 --> 05:26:22,369
I need to see what the hell you're doing up here.

4482
05:26:22,689 --> 05:26:23,189
Where are you?

4483
05:26:23,810 --> 05:26:29,009
Why do they always do this?

4484
05:26:30,770 --> 05:26:31,569
Just go home.

4485
05:26:31,569 --> 05:26:33,330
Why would you sleep on a park bench?

4486
05:26:37,950 --> 05:26:39,069
Like, go home.

4487
05:26:39,069 --> 05:26:43,500
What are you doing?

4488
05:26:43,500 --> 05:26:43,819
All right.

4489
05:26:43,819 --> 05:26:44,299
We're good.

4490
05:26:44,860 --> 05:26:45,419
How's the cat?

4491
05:26:48,060 --> 05:26:48,860
Pretty good, actually.

4492
05:26:50,340 --> 05:26:50,740
Dog?

4493
05:26:50,740 --> 05:26:51,139
Bladder?

4494
05:26:51,139 --> 05:26:51,619
Where's the dog?

4495
05:26:52,180 --> 05:26:58,180
Have you eaten?

4496
05:26:58,979 --> 05:27:00,580
Dog needs to go to the bathroom.

4497
05:27:00,580 --> 05:27:02,180
This is first to die.

4498
05:27:02,180 --> 05:27:05,060
This is Akira and Miko.

4499
05:27:10,540 --> 05:27:11,580
Mourning a friend.

4500
05:27:14,099 --> 05:27:14,900
Oh, right.

4501
05:27:14,900 --> 05:27:15,540
First to die.

4502
05:27:15,540 --> 05:27:22,659
I think it's time.

4503
05:27:22,659 --> 05:27:23,459
We gotta clean this up.

4504
05:27:27,810 --> 05:27:29,169
Release all these spirits.

4505
05:27:30,130 --> 05:27:31,409
Release, release, release.

4506
05:27:34,909 --> 05:27:36,110
Release this one, too.

4507
05:27:36,110 --> 05:27:36,990
Get them all out of here.

4508
05:27:41,139 --> 05:27:41,860
Yeah, get out.

4509
05:27:42,659 --> 05:27:42,979
Out.

4510
05:27:58,610 --> 05:27:59,409
All right, come eat.

4511
05:28:08,159 --> 05:28:09,680
Cat was eating out of the...

4512
05:28:10,240 --> 05:28:10,799
It's all right.

4513
05:28:11,680 --> 05:28:20,060
You are the most fucked up person out of everybody.

4514
05:28:20,060 --> 05:28:20,560
I swear.

4515
05:28:24,139 --> 05:28:24,540
You just...

4516
05:28:24,540 --> 05:28:25,979
I give you a task and you just don't do it.

4517
05:28:31,939 --> 05:28:32,819
Well, fucking whatever.

4518
05:28:35,470 --> 05:28:35,869
All right.

4519
05:28:35,869 --> 05:28:37,069
Dog, cat, everybody's good.

4520
05:28:40,290 --> 05:28:43,840
Oh, getting you mail?

4521
05:28:44,860 --> 05:28:45,979
Do we have mail?

4522
05:28:45,979 --> 05:28:46,459
Oh, shit.

4523
05:28:46,459 --> 05:28:47,020
We have mail.

4524
05:28:47,740 --> 05:28:55,139
The urns are blocking the way.

4525
05:28:56,110 --> 05:29:09,340
Oh, we'll just get rid of them.

4526
05:29:09,340 --> 05:29:09,659
What?

4527
05:29:09,659 --> 05:29:11,419
I heard bad sounds?

4528
05:29:15,580 --> 05:29:15,819
All right.

4529
05:29:15,819 --> 05:29:16,459
He's sleeping.

4530
05:29:17,099 --> 05:29:20,669
Okay.

4531
05:29:21,470 --> 05:29:21,790
All right.

4532
05:29:22,830 --> 05:29:23,630
Fast forward.

4533
05:29:24,349 --> 05:29:25,069
Playing with the cat.

4534
05:29:26,189 --> 05:29:27,709
When you get up, eat.

4535
05:29:27,709 --> 05:29:28,830
I'll just queue it up for you.

4536
05:29:30,580 --> 05:29:31,459
Pick up a serving.

4537
05:29:32,419 --> 05:29:33,580
Go eat.

4538
05:29:34,459 --> 05:29:35,169
No, no.

4539
05:29:35,169 --> 05:29:35,569
What are you...

4540
05:29:35,569 --> 05:29:35,810
Why?

4541
05:29:35,810 --> 05:29:36,450
What would you do to...

4542
05:29:36,450 --> 05:29:37,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4543
05:29:37,250 --> 05:29:37,970
What are you doing?

4544
05:29:37,970 --> 05:29:38,209
Why?

4545
05:29:39,090 --> 05:29:40,049
We were just playing.

4546
05:29:41,009 --> 05:29:42,049
We were just playing.

4547
05:29:43,119 --> 05:29:44,400
Oh, my God.

4548
05:29:44,400 --> 05:29:45,200
Why?

4549
05:29:45,200 --> 05:29:46,430
Where are you now?

4550
05:29:47,740 --> 05:29:48,700
This is unbelievable.

4551
05:29:51,520 --> 05:29:52,020
What?

4552
05:29:54,979 --> 05:29:56,419
No, no.

4553
05:29:56,419 --> 05:29:57,220
Cat has to...

4554
05:30:33,330 --> 05:30:33,830
No.

4555
05:30:43,020 --> 05:30:45,099
I still have you.

4556
05:30:45,099 --> 05:30:45,740
Hold on.

4557
05:30:45,740 --> 05:30:46,700
I need to redo this.

4558
05:30:48,349 --> 05:30:49,470
Oh, my fucking head.

4559
05:30:50,110 --> 05:30:53,020
The cat made the right choice.

4560
05:30:53,580 --> 05:30:55,020
Yes, the cat did.

4561
05:30:55,020 --> 05:30:57,759
I'm honest to God.

4562
05:30:57,759 --> 05:30:58,799
Well, it's just you and me.

4563
05:30:59,599 --> 05:31:02,560
I need to get out of this house before something else bad happens.

4564
05:31:04,479 --> 05:31:08,209
You don't run away, please.

4565
05:31:09,169 --> 05:31:16,419
Did this bite me?

4566
05:31:19,970 --> 05:31:20,470
Okay.

4567
05:31:23,490 --> 05:31:25,009
Why are you yelling at the dog?

4568
05:31:25,009 --> 05:31:26,369
The dog didn't do anything.

4569
05:31:27,169 --> 05:31:38,180
Am I gonna go piss on this lady?

4570
05:31:50,689 --> 05:31:51,090
Bladder.

4571
05:31:51,090 --> 05:31:51,650
I need to take the...

4572
05:31:55,889 --> 05:31:56,369
All right.

4573
05:31:56,369 --> 05:31:56,849
That's it.

4574
05:32:00,959 --> 05:32:01,439
All right.

4575
05:32:01,439 --> 05:32:02,080
You're done.

4576
05:32:02,080 --> 05:32:02,479
You're out.

4577
05:32:02,479 --> 05:32:02,880
You're out.

4578
05:32:02,880 --> 05:32:03,279
You're out.

4579
05:32:03,919 --> 05:32:04,639
You're out.

4580
05:32:04,639 --> 05:32:06,240
That's enough out of you.

4581
05:32:09,700 --> 05:32:11,299
You're out of fucking control.

4582
05:32:11,299 --> 05:32:12,979
Absolutely out of control.

4583
05:32:12,979 --> 05:32:13,700
Put it away.

4584
05:32:13,700 --> 05:32:14,419
You're done.

4585
05:32:14,419 --> 05:32:14,919
Enough.

4586
05:32:16,560 --> 05:32:17,279
My God.

4587
05:32:17,279 --> 05:32:19,040
You've chainsawed three people now.

4588
05:32:19,040 --> 05:32:20,159
Un-fucking-believable.

4589
05:32:22,479 --> 05:32:23,279
No, the dog.

4590
05:32:23,279 --> 05:32:23,680
Okay.

4591
05:32:23,680 --> 05:32:25,200
How do I get the dog in the fruit house?

4592
05:32:25,919 --> 05:32:28,020
All right.

4593
05:32:28,020 --> 05:32:30,099
Can I have the dog go to the fruit house?

4594
05:32:30,740 --> 05:32:37,549
You're gonna piss on the couch.

4595
05:32:52,580 --> 05:32:53,549
All right.

4596
05:32:53,549 --> 05:32:56,669
It's time to transition to a different group.

4597
05:32:57,470 --> 05:32:59,619
This just got completely out of hand.

4598
05:33:00,340 --> 05:33:11,950
How do I get the dog out of here?

4599
05:33:12,509 --> 05:33:29,060
I've sent him to hell.

4600
05:33:29,869 --> 05:33:30,669
This is where I belong.

4601
05:33:38,340 --> 05:33:39,700
This is where you belong.

4602
05:33:39,700 --> 05:33:40,340
Yeah, goodbye.

4603
05:33:41,139 --> 05:33:41,639
You're out.

4604
05:33:43,150 --> 05:33:43,650
What?

4605
05:33:44,590 --> 05:33:45,630
Oh, shit.

4606
05:33:50,540 --> 05:33:53,020
Uh, the last sim in this household has died.

4607
05:33:57,740 --> 05:34:02,750
Uh, adoption services will take care of giant and eight.

4608
05:34:02,750 --> 05:34:04,430
A good loving family will be found.

4609
05:34:10,029 --> 05:34:10,529
Okay.

4610
05:34:21,810 --> 05:34:23,729
Um, let's pick up what we left off over here.

4611
05:34:26,509 --> 05:34:28,830
Everyone's still alive over here and nobody's murdering each other.

4612
05:34:28,830 --> 05:34:29,470
Select the sim to play.

4613
05:34:29,470 --> 05:34:30,590
We're gonna go with a banana.

4614
05:34:35,139 --> 05:34:38,180
I got the haunted mirror in here and I also have the genie to still play with.

4615
05:34:38,180 --> 05:34:40,259
And, uh, one other thing.

4616
05:34:40,259 --> 05:34:46,909
I also do this to activate it by.

4617
05:34:46,909 --> 05:34:47,950
Let me see how to activate it.

4618
05:34:47,950 --> 05:34:48,830
Let's just see how it works.

05:34:51,360 --> 05:34:52,880
So it's T let's see.

05:35:00,990 --> 05:35:02,349
And then we need an object ID.

4625
05:35:08,299 --> 05:35:12,340
TM like this set hat.

4626
05:35:12,340 --> 05:35:13,060

05:35:45,869 --> 05:35:46,189
So what?

4634
05:35:46,189 --> 05:35:47,150
I can just right click.

4635
05:35:47,869 --> 05:35:51,619
You need cheats to be on.

4636
05:35:53,139 --> 05:35:56,459
Yeah, they should be on already.

4637
05:36:02,560 --> 05:36:04,560

4638
05:36:07,459 --> 05:36:08,979

4639
05:36:08,979 --> 05:36:09,540

Okay, good.

4649
05:36:30,740 --> 05:36:31,779
So that should be it, right?

Okay, set as head.

05:36:38,979 --> 05:36:43,310
Why is it so big?

4653
05:36:43,950 --> 05:36:47,090
That should not be this big.

4654
05:36:59,889 --> 05:37:00,689
Reset that.

4655
05:37:00,689 --> 05:37:01,090

4656
05:37:01,090 --> 05:37:01,409

05:37:01,409 --> 05:37:01,970
Get rid of this.

4658
05:37:01,970 --> 05:37:02,770
How do I get rid of this?

4659
05:37:04,020 --> 05:37:04,900
It's so huge.

4660
05:37:04,900 --> 05:37:05,700

4661
05:37:06,580 --> 05:37:07,139

4663
05:37:14,819 --> 05:37:15,459
All right.

4664
05:37:15,459 --> 05:37:18,270
Can I put a bed on my head and have somebody sleep on it?

4665
05:37:18,830 --> 05:37:21,169
Let's see.

4666
05:37:21,169 --> 05:37:21,889
What about a chair?

4667
05:37:26,979 --> 05:37:28,259
Why is that fucking huge?

4668
05:37:28,979 --> 05:37:39,310
All right, get in this chair.

4669
05:37:40,110 --> 05:37:40,990
Is he going to grow?

4670
05:37:41,869 --> 05:37:48,740
No, it's because the head proportions are really fucked up on all the characters, right?

4671
05:37:48,740 --> 05:37:49,240
Oh, no.

4672
05:37:50,419 --> 05:37:52,939
All right, sit on his head.

4673
05:37:59,380 --> 05:38:00,419
Can you get up there?

4674
05:38:00,419 --> 05:38:01,700
Nap lazily.

4675
05:38:01,700 --> 05:38:03,060
We have to be in the same room, don't you?

4676
05:38:04,750 --> 05:38:05,250
Oh.

4677
05:38:08,340 --> 05:38:08,840
Okay.

4678
05:38:09,380 --> 05:38:18,849
So now from here, can somebody else sit on top of him?

4679
05:38:19,650 --> 05:38:20,150
Rita!

4680
05:38:20,689 --> 05:38:21,189
George!

4681
05:38:32,000 --> 05:38:33,700
Can you not get up there?

4682
05:38:33,700 --> 05:38:34,200
Get up there.

4683
05:38:37,490 --> 05:38:38,130
No, you can't.

4684
05:38:43,409 --> 05:38:44,610
Sit on your own head.

4685
05:38:45,409 --> 05:38:50,369
Is he sleeping?

4686
05:38:50,369 --> 05:38:51,409
He's asleep right now.

4687
05:38:54,580 --> 05:38:55,860
I have to put a chair on the other guy.

4688
05:39:01,569 --> 05:39:02,290
Oh, God.

4689
05:39:02,290 --> 05:39:03,729
This is going to be fucking ridiculous.

4690
05:39:03,729 --> 05:39:05,250
He's going to be out of hand real quick here.

4691
05:39:09,409 --> 05:39:10,529
Oh, is he stuck in the wall?

4692
05:39:13,409 --> 05:39:15,360
Where is she?

4693
05:39:19,659 --> 05:39:20,459
He's stuck in the wall.

4694
05:39:20,459 --> 05:39:21,419
Hold on, get out, get out, get out.

4695
05:39:24,340 --> 05:39:25,220
Turn off the computer.

4696
05:39:25,220 --> 05:39:26,740
Everybody wants to play with the computer.

4697
05:39:30,459 --> 05:39:31,259
All right, come over here.

4698
05:39:34,939 --> 05:39:36,220
Okay, you sit here.

4699
05:39:37,180 --> 05:39:38,380
I don't know, you sit here.

4700
05:39:40,619 --> 05:39:42,060
And then you sit there.

4701
05:39:44,020 --> 05:39:44,520
Go for it.

4702
05:39:47,040 --> 05:39:48,000
No, get over here.

4703
05:39:48,880 --> 05:39:49,380
No!

4704
05:39:50,020 --> 05:39:50,659
What are you doing?

4705
05:39:55,409 --> 05:39:56,849
I ain't ready to go on the computer.

4706
05:39:56,849 --> 05:39:58,369
I think I'm going to go on the computer now.

4707
05:39:59,409 --> 05:40:00,689
Did you just tell me to get up?

4708
05:40:00,689 --> 05:40:01,250
I'm going to get up.

4709
05:40:01,250 --> 05:40:03,250
No, I'm going to go on the computer again.

4710
05:40:03,250 --> 05:40:28,080
Let's get them all.

4711
05:40:28,080 --> 05:40:29,840
Let's get the chairs.

4712
05:40:30,880 --> 05:40:33,799
What's that?

4713
05:40:34,580 --> 05:40:36,259
Why is that tense music playing?

4714
05:40:36,259 --> 05:40:37,299
What's the tense music for?

4715
05:40:38,259 --> 05:40:38,759
Huh?

4716
05:40:39,139 --> 05:40:39,639
Hello?

4717
05:40:40,580 --> 05:40:42,220
One, two, three, four, who's five?

4718
05:40:42,939 --> 05:40:43,900
Where's Tommy Tomato?

4719
05:40:44,540 --> 05:41:02,060
What is going on?

4720
05:41:02,060 --> 05:41:02,779
Do you guys hear this?

4721
05:41:03,340 --> 05:41:11,569
Is somebody banging at the door?

4722
05:41:11,569 --> 05:41:18,560
What the fuck is happening over here?

4723
05:41:25,860 --> 05:41:27,779
Relax, calm it down down over here.

4724
05:41:27,779 --> 05:41:28,900
What's going on here?

4725
05:41:37,009 --> 05:41:37,970
He doesn't live with anybody.

4726
05:41:39,970 --> 05:41:41,520
He lives by himself.

4727
05:41:44,880 --> 05:41:45,380
Good evening.

4728
05:42:09,090 --> 05:42:10,610
We have to despise each other.

4729
05:42:13,520 --> 05:42:14,080
Let's go in there.

4730
05:42:14,080 --> 05:42:14,400
Let's go.

4731
05:42:14,400 --> 05:42:16,080
Just take the fuck and steal everything he has.

4732
05:42:20,900 --> 05:42:21,380
He's gone.

4733
05:42:21,380 --> 05:42:21,939
He left the apartment.

4734
05:42:21,939 --> 05:42:22,439
Let's go.

4735
05:42:41,619 --> 05:42:42,979
All right, we're all here.

4736
05:42:44,500 --> 05:42:45,060
Nice.

4737
05:42:45,060 --> 05:42:46,259
I like this place.

4738
05:42:46,259 --> 05:42:48,340
Ooh, you know what?

4739
05:42:49,220 --> 05:42:50,180
It's beautiful.

4740
05:42:50,180 --> 05:42:51,139
You got cool shit.

4741
05:42:59,860 --> 05:43:13,020
Oh, this is not moving out.

4742
05:43:13,020 --> 05:43:15,520
That's why he's freaking out so much.

4743
05:43:16,080 --> 05:43:30,049
All these boxes and shit come in.

4744
05:43:32,639 --> 05:43:33,200
Let's go.

4745
05:43:33,200 --> 05:43:33,680
Get in here.

4746
05:43:33,680 --> 05:43:34,720
Look at this shit.

4747
05:43:34,720 --> 05:43:37,759
He's got a fireplace.

4748
05:43:37,759 --> 05:43:39,599
He's got one of those super toilets.

4749
05:43:39,599 --> 05:43:40,740
What is that?

4750
05:43:40,740 --> 05:43:44,180
He's got like a telepod.

4751
05:43:44,180 --> 05:43:44,680
What?

4752
05:43:46,779 --> 05:43:48,139
This guy's apartment is amazing.

4753
05:43:52,080 --> 05:43:52,580
Wow.

4754
05:43:53,200 --> 05:44:01,099
Hey, come on down.

05:44:01,979 --> 05:44:08,049
Let's get a mixologist here.

4756
05:44:09,490 --> 05:44:11,810
Let's play the piano.

Let's go.

4760
05:44:14,549 --> 05:44:19,650
Uh, the genie's a bartender.

4761
05:44:25,669 --> 05:44:28,150
If the pianist is the gnome, I'm gonna laugh.

4762
05:44:34,340 --> 05:44:34,840
What?

4763
05:44:37,189 --> 05:44:38,229
This person's dead.

4764
05:44:38,869 --> 05:44:43,540

Computer, I gotta get out the computer.

4769
05:44:58,130 --> 05:45:01,189
God, I'm gonna play the VR.

4770
05:45:01,189 --> 05:45:06,849

Take selfie, take photo, play game, browse web.

4774
05:45:21,029 --> 05:45:21,750
No, no, no.

4775
05:45:21,750 --> 05:45:22,250
Household.

4776

Okay, let's go on in.

4785
05:46:01,720 --> 05:46:02,360
Look at this.

4786
05:46:02,360 --> 05:46:03,319
Everyone's having a good time.

4787
05:46:06,209 --> 05:46:06,930
Meeting new friends.

4788
05:46:06,930 --> 05:46:07,729
Shaman has arrived.

4789
05:46:08,369 --> 05:46:11,139
Got a couple of beers here.

4790
05:46:11,700 --> 05:46:12,869
This is all right.

4791
05:46:14,900 --> 05:46:16,599
Uh, casual disco.

4792
05:46:16,599 --> 05:46:17,720
Let me get, let me grab a drink.

4793
05:46:24,000 --> 05:46:25,680
Why is it playing baby crib music?

4794
05:46:28,200 --> 05:46:30,520
Okay, where's um, grab a drink.

4795
05:46:41,430 --> 05:46:43,029
Yeah, why, what is, where's that coming from?

4796
05:46:45,909 --> 05:46:46,549
Where's the shaman?

4797
05:46:52,240 --> 05:46:53,759
Very focused on what?

4798
05:46:54,560 --> 05:46:57,639
Can somebody meet the shaman?

4799
05:46:57,639 --> 05:46:58,840
I said the shaman was here.

4800
05:47:05,319 --> 05:47:06,720
Where's the shaman?

4801
05:47:07,520 --> 05:47:11,009
I don't see a shaman.

4802
05:47:14,849 --> 05:47:16,209
Is that the shaman?

4803
05:47:16,209 --> 05:47:17,169
That is the shaman.

4804
05:47:19,009 --> 05:47:23,810
Okay, um, so how do we, uh, how do we get this going?

4805
05:47:25,919 --> 05:47:32,130
Share knock knock joke compliment spiritual journey.

4806
05:47:35,090 --> 05:47:42,470
I still don't know where this crib music is coming from.

4807
05:47:50,529 --> 05:47:52,740
Uh, did I do it?

4808
05:48:01,459 --> 05:48:04,340
Uh, that doesn't look, it doesn't look like a spiritual journey to me.

4809
05:48:08,799 --> 05:48:09,759
Ghost is playing.

4810
05:48:13,569 --> 05:48:14,930
All of you go on a spiritual journey.

4811
05:48:20,659 --> 05:48:21,220
Throw a party.

4812
05:48:21,220 --> 05:48:25,220
I am trying to get everyone to invite their friends and go on like spiritual journeys and shit.

4813
05:48:25,220 --> 05:48:27,270
Can you call anybody else?

4814
05:48:27,909 --> 05:48:31,590
This guy, get over here.

4815
05:48:31,590 --> 05:48:33,270
He said it's, it's too late.

4816
05:48:33,270 --> 05:48:38,740
I don't have, everybody had that I make friends with dies guys.

4817
05:48:39,299 --> 05:48:42,000
I've made like four friends.

4818
05:48:43,090 --> 05:48:44,770
And we've killed half the town.

4819
05:48:45,490 --> 05:48:47,479
It's because it's 4 a.m.

4820
05:48:47,479 --> 05:48:48,520
Where is the owner?

4821
05:48:48,520 --> 05:48:49,159
Where did he go?

4822
05:48:49,799 --> 05:49:05,669
Okay, let's see.

4823
05:49:05,669 --> 05:49:06,150
Give it to me.

4824
05:49:10,389 --> 05:49:11,029
All right, here we go.

4825
05:49:13,619 --> 05:49:14,259
Time to drink.

4826
05:49:15,060 --> 05:49:15,459
Take it.

4827
05:49:19,959 --> 05:49:22,200
Do not drink this unless you are ready for what it may bring.

4828
05:49:23,400 --> 05:49:23,880
Drink it.

4829
05:49:27,700 --> 05:49:28,180
I'm ready.

4830
05:49:34,659 --> 05:49:35,860
Spiritual journey incoming.

4831
05:49:38,099 --> 05:49:41,599
This guy just brew coffee and bring it over here and just lie.

4832
05:49:50,950 --> 05:49:55,189
Very self-assured sims of this trade feel good about themselves and often experience extra confidence.

4833
05:49:59,520 --> 05:50:02,000
Some spiritual journey this was.

4834
05:50:02,720 --> 05:50:05,479
I'm just staring at the TV.

4835
05:50:05,479 --> 05:50:11,799
Just thinking about grilled cheese.

4836
05:50:56,259 --> 05:50:57,380
Uh, okay, how about the...

4837
05:51:05,919 --> 05:51:06,560
Look at this guy.

4838
05:51:08,400 --> 05:51:09,119
Party.

4839
05:51:09,119 --> 05:51:10,080
It's time for a party.

4840
05:51:11,040 --> 05:51:14,689
One of you freak shows has to be awake right now, right?

4841
05:51:30,150 --> 05:51:31,349
Get over here.

4842
05:51:31,349 --> 05:51:32,389
It's not too late.

4843
05:51:34,279 --> 05:51:35,479
They're all sleeping.

4844
05:51:35,479 --> 05:51:36,360
Oh, fuck off.

4845
05:51:43,200 --> 05:51:45,590
What time is it?

4846
05:51:46,229 --> 05:51:46,790
Come on.

4847
05:51:46,790 --> 05:51:47,669
6 30 a.m.

4848
05:51:49,240 --> 05:51:49,880
7 a.m.

4849
05:51:51,750 --> 05:51:53,029
Start the party all over again.

4850
05:51:53,029 --> 05:51:53,590
Las Vegas.

4851
05:51:53,590 --> 05:51:54,229
This is where we are.

4852
05:51:54,229 --> 05:51:54,549
Come on.

4853
05:51:57,349 --> 05:51:58,709
Definitely not sleeping at 7 a.m.

4854
05:52:34,630 --> 05:52:39,700
No, don't invite him.

4855
05:52:39,700 --> 05:52:40,259
That's his house.

4856
05:52:41,060 --> 05:52:41,380
All right.

4857
05:52:41,380 --> 05:52:41,939
Let's go.

4858
05:52:41,939 --> 05:52:42,419
Here they come.

4859
05:52:43,220 --> 05:52:45,139
Are we losing a bartender?

4860
05:52:45,700 --> 05:52:46,500
Get another one.

4861
05:52:46,500 --> 05:52:46,979
Another one.

4862
05:52:46,979 --> 05:52:47,939
Hire another mixologist.

4863
05:52:54,930 --> 05:52:55,490
Bring him in.

4864
05:52:56,549 --> 05:52:57,430
Welcome everybody.

4865
05:52:58,150 --> 05:53:02,099
Come on down.

4866
05:53:02,819 --> 05:53:04,439
I'll be right over.

4867
05:53:06,740 --> 05:53:07,459
Uncomfortable.

4868
05:53:08,020 --> 05:53:09,060
Come on in.

4869
05:53:09,060 --> 05:53:09,459
Here we go.

4870
05:53:10,340 --> 05:53:13,860
There's at least five or six to maybe there's at least 10 people coming over right now.

4871
05:53:13,860 --> 05:53:14,819
Greet them.

4872
05:53:14,819 --> 05:53:16,709
Get them off your asses and host this party.

4873
05:53:22,389 --> 05:53:23,750
Are they coming over to my house?

4874
05:53:24,310 --> 05:53:30,209
Here we go.

4875
05:53:30,209 --> 05:53:31,090
Here we go.

4876
05:53:31,090 --> 05:53:31,650
Here we go.

4877
05:53:32,610 --> 05:53:33,090
Load them up.

4878
05:53:33,650 --> 05:53:37,909
Arita Ma music.

4879
05:53:37,909 --> 05:53:39,590
Because he has a stereo system somewhere, right?

4880
05:53:40,150 --> 05:53:43,880
No, that's a toilet.

4881
05:53:48,020 --> 05:53:48,500
Stereo.

4882
05:53:48,500 --> 05:53:49,459
He's got to have a stereo.

4883
05:53:51,430 --> 05:53:52,930
No piano.

4884
05:53:52,930 --> 05:53:53,889
Get the pianist in here again.

4885
05:53:54,529 --> 05:53:56,759
There it is.

4886
05:53:56,759 --> 05:53:57,240
Okay.

4887
05:53:57,240 --> 05:53:57,959
Music is playing.

4888
05:53:59,299 --> 05:54:00,419
Change volume.

4889
05:54:00,419 --> 05:54:00,819
Hi.

4890
05:54:00,819 --> 05:54:01,380
Max it up.

4891
05:54:04,319 --> 05:54:06,080
Why would you be listening to this?

4892
05:54:06,080 --> 05:54:07,200
Fucking pop music.

4893
05:54:08,000 --> 05:54:13,990
Let's start a dance party.

4894
05:54:14,880 --> 05:54:15,680
Dance together.

4895
05:54:16,560 --> 05:54:21,060
Bring it in.

4896
05:54:31,319 --> 05:54:32,599
Get them all in the living room.

4897
05:54:35,240 --> 05:54:37,759
What are they all doing here?

4898
05:54:37,759 --> 05:54:39,360
Why is this person so small?

4899
05:54:40,159 --> 05:54:44,979
Oh, it's a kid.

4900
05:55:06,639 --> 05:55:08,159
I'm trying to make them leave.

4901
05:55:09,119 --> 05:55:14,209
I'm trying to get the kid out of here.

4902
05:55:15,090 --> 05:55:15,729
Get out of here.

4903
05:55:17,520 --> 05:55:18,000
Junk them up.

4904
05:55:18,000 --> 05:55:18,400
Go away.

4905
05:55:21,810 --> 05:55:22,450
Oh, wait, wait.

4906
05:55:22,450 --> 05:55:22,529
Yeah.

4907
05:55:22,529 --> 05:55:22,849
Hold on.

4908
05:55:42,229 --> 05:55:42,389
Okay.

4909
05:55:42,389 --> 05:55:42,790
They're good.

4910
05:55:45,430 --> 05:55:45,750
All right.

4911
05:55:46,389 --> 05:55:48,740
Welcome to the party.

4912
05:55:48,740 --> 05:55:49,939
Let's get some drinks served.

4913
05:55:49,939 --> 05:55:50,259
All right.

4914
05:55:50,900 --> 05:55:54,610
Nice.

4915
05:55:54,610 --> 05:55:55,409
This is looking good.

4916
05:55:59,560 --> 05:56:00,279
Fun games.

4917
05:56:00,279 --> 05:56:00,919
Fun friends.

4918
05:56:01,639 --> 05:56:04,759
Uh-oh.

4919
05:56:04,759 --> 05:56:07,520
Oh, he's on a spiritual journey.

4920
05:56:07,520 --> 05:56:08,159
Right, right, right.

4921
05:57:01,189 --> 05:57:02,389
I can't lock the door.

4922
05:57:04,529 --> 05:57:05,090
Oh, I can't.

4923
05:57:05,090 --> 05:57:05,409
I can't.

4924
05:57:06,290 --> 05:57:10,759
Where is he?

4925
05:57:11,560 --> 05:57:13,680
Why is everybody freaking out about him?

4926
05:57:14,400 --> 05:57:14,720
Wait.

4927
05:57:15,520 --> 05:57:19,830
Where is he?

4928
05:57:19,909 --> 05:57:20,709
Where's the blueberry?

4929
05:57:21,349 --> 05:57:25,669
What happened?

4930
05:57:26,389 --> 05:57:27,110
What happened?

4931
05:57:28,159 --> 05:57:29,439
What happened?

4932
05:57:29,439 --> 05:57:30,479
What's he doing?

4933
05:57:31,439 --> 05:57:38,360
Why is everybody so pissed?

4934
05:57:50,599 --> 05:57:54,520
Barry feels as if he's being pulled out of his body into another realm.

4935
05:57:54,520 --> 05:57:59,639
A presence of a benevolent entity appears who telepathically communicates

4936
05:57:59,639 --> 05:58:07,520
that she wishes to guide Barry around the astral place.

4937
05:58:07,520 --> 05:58:13,509
Follow.

4938
05:58:13,509 --> 05:58:17,029
Barry finds himself outside a hut with sandals outside.

4939
05:58:17,029 --> 05:58:20,310
An overwhelming feeling that someone sacred lives there

4940
05:58:20,310 --> 05:58:20,869
takes hold.

4941
05:58:20,869 --> 05:58:23,270
A much older version of Barry emerges from the hut.

4942
05:58:23,270 --> 05:58:24,549
What should Barry do?

4943
05:58:25,430 --> 05:58:28,389
What is your purpose?

4944
05:58:29,029 --> 05:58:39,479
The old man's expression changes from kind smile to berating gaze.

4945
05:58:39,479 --> 05:58:39,959
He speaks,

4946
05:58:40,520 --> 05:58:42,919
My purpose has nothing to do with why you are here.

4947
05:58:42,919 --> 05:58:44,919
This is a sacred place of self-realization.

4948
05:58:44,919 --> 05:58:45,560
You're not ready.

4949
05:58:46,599 --> 05:58:52,020
That's annoying.

4950
05:59:02,450 --> 05:59:03,009
Let's go.

4951
05:59:03,009 --> 05:59:03,729
Let's go.

4952
05:59:03,729 --> 05:59:03,970
What?

4953
05:59:03,970 --> 05:59:05,090
And cooking level one.

4954
05:59:05,090 --> 05:59:06,130
Who has cooking level one?

4955
05:59:08,930 --> 05:59:12,310
Any idiots have cooking level one?

4956
05:59:15,000 --> 05:59:15,959
Oh, god damn it.

4957
05:59:15,959 --> 05:59:16,520
Really?

4958
05:59:16,520 --> 05:59:23,990
What?

4959
05:59:23,990 --> 05:59:24,229
Why?

4960
05:59:24,869 --> 05:59:29,220
I don't have any weed.

4961
05:59:44,630 --> 05:59:59,029
Very competent.

4962
06:00:02,659 --> 06:00:03,939
Buy weed from the computer.

4963
06:00:03,939 --> 06:00:04,979
Put your clothes back on.

4964
06:00:06,020 --> 06:00:15,509
She was happy, but wait a minute.

4965
06:00:16,549 --> 06:00:25,060
Get up.

4966
06:00:35,400 --> 06:00:36,759
We did it.

4967
06:01:07,400 --> 06:01:09,880
Hey, no, try for baby.

4968
06:01:11,080 --> 06:01:11,720
What happened?

4969
06:01:11,880 --> 06:01:12,840
What are you doing?

4970
06:01:27,159 --> 06:01:29,159
We just started dating.

4971
06:01:29,159 --> 06:01:30,520
Try for a baby.

4972
06:01:31,959 --> 06:01:39,939
Hey, the first time I kiss you, you want to have a baby?

4973
06:01:42,180 --> 06:01:46,360
I can't do first person.

4974
06:01:47,000 --> 06:01:47,560
I can't.

4975
06:01:48,200 --> 06:01:51,250
No, I can't do first person.

4976
06:01:52,049 --> 06:02:07,779
This isn't even our house.

4977
06:02:10,209 --> 06:02:20,919
Man.

4978
06:02:21,720 --> 06:02:23,159
No, look, it's pretend, see?

4979
06:02:23,799 --> 06:02:26,500
Not even our house.

4980
06:02:26,500 --> 06:02:27,299
Not even our house.

4981
06:02:36,049 --> 06:02:38,130
Here's the thing that I can't comprehend.

4982
06:02:38,130 --> 06:02:42,389
Where is the guy who owns this apartment?

4983
06:02:43,540 --> 06:02:46,020
I just had sex in his bed.

4984
06:02:55,860 --> 06:03:12,549
Here's the apartment key to this apartment to this one.

4985
06:03:12,549 --> 06:03:14,790
Here's the key to this apartment.

4986
06:03:14,790 --> 06:03:18,439
Okay, hold on.

4987
06:03:18,439 --> 06:03:19,799
More choices.

4988
06:03:19,799 --> 06:03:20,360
Romance.

4989
06:03:22,080 --> 06:03:22,959
Ask to be girlfriend.

4990
06:03:22,959 --> 06:03:23,599
Come on.

4991
06:03:23,599 --> 06:03:24,880
Let's make a baby.

4992
06:03:24,880 --> 06:03:33,220
Here we go.

4993
06:03:34,020 --> 06:03:40,319
All right, now girlfriend just became girlfriend of Peter.

4994
06:03:41,119 --> 06:03:46,819
Attempt more choices.

4995
06:03:46,819 --> 06:03:47,139
Come on.

4996
06:03:51,919 --> 06:03:52,400
What's wrong?

4997
06:03:53,729 --> 06:03:55,009
Why is everybody staring?

4998
06:03:56,549 --> 06:03:57,509
You want to try for a baby?

4999
06:04:00,770 --> 06:04:04,119
Let's try for a baby this time.

5000
06:04:09,349 --> 06:04:10,229
No, that's awful.

5001
06:04:10,229 --> 06:04:10,630
No, no, no.

5002
06:04:10,630 --> 06:04:12,150
I'm not going to like have him go in there.

5003
06:04:12,869 --> 06:04:18,770
All right, we're not going to see it.

5004
06:04:18,770 --> 06:04:19,810
Look, we're going to go this way.

5005
06:04:28,799 --> 06:04:30,979
Okay, we're good.

5006
06:04:30,979 --> 06:04:32,340
Break out the candles, make it romantic.

5007
06:04:32,340 --> 06:04:33,540
Peter is about to woohoo.

5008
06:04:48,520 --> 06:04:49,319
It didn't work.

5009
06:04:51,380 --> 06:04:52,099
It didn't work.

5010
06:04:52,099 --> 06:04:52,979
I have to get that off.

5011
06:04:53,540 --> 06:05:06,369
All right, did it work?

5012
06:05:06,369 --> 06:05:18,770
Baby and baby.

5013
06:05:19,409 --> 06:05:19,970
No, baby.

5014
06:05:21,409 --> 06:05:28,279
Did it work?

5015
06:05:28,279 --> 06:05:49,330
I have to do a pregnancy test.

5016
06:05:49,330 --> 06:05:49,970
Since when?

5017
06:06:01,990 --> 06:06:03,669
Why does she have money come all up?

5018
06:06:04,470 --> 06:06:06,470
You're getting in.

5019
06:06:08,470 --> 06:06:09,349
Okay, all right, all right.

5020
06:06:09,349 --> 06:06:10,069
Slow down here.

5021
06:06:12,200 --> 06:06:14,580
I have no control.

5022
06:06:14,580 --> 06:06:15,299
I don't have control.

5023
06:06:16,020 --> 06:06:18,689
Where did she go?

5024
06:06:19,330 --> 06:06:24,080
All right, get this thing out of here.

5025
06:06:26,599 --> 06:06:27,479
I can't even sell it.

5026
06:06:28,040 --> 06:06:29,240
I don't have access to this house.

5027
06:06:30,790 --> 06:06:31,509
Oh, shit.

5028
06:06:32,740 --> 06:06:34,020
Clear out, clear out, clear out.

5029
06:06:34,020 --> 06:06:34,580
Everybody out.

5030
06:06:35,220 --> 06:06:39,380
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

5031
06:06:39,380 --> 06:06:39,939
He didn't even know.

5032
06:06:39,939 --> 06:06:40,259
He didn't know.

5033
06:06:40,259 --> 06:06:40,740
He didn't know.

5034
06:06:40,740 --> 06:06:46,099
Out.

5035
06:06:46,099 --> 06:06:48,099
All right, everybody pause again.

5036
06:06:48,099 --> 06:06:49,919
We're going to make this quick.

5037
06:06:51,240 --> 06:06:59,139
You, go here, go here, go here, go here.

5038
06:07:00,099 --> 06:07:01,700
You, we're going to first person.

5039
06:07:04,150 --> 06:07:13,650
Okay, I'm just going to punch him in the face.

5040
06:07:13,650 --> 06:07:14,209
Knock him out.

5041
06:07:18,470 --> 06:07:23,540
Wait, what?

5042
06:07:23,540 --> 06:07:24,180
What are you guys doing?

5043
06:07:25,220 --> 06:07:30,040
Where'd he go?

5044
06:07:36,389 --> 06:07:36,790
Oh, shit.

5045
06:07:36,790 --> 06:07:37,189
She's back.

5046
06:07:40,279 --> 06:07:42,279
I think she really thinks this is my house.

5047
06:07:42,919 --> 06:07:48,689
He doesn't even know.

5048
06:07:48,689 --> 06:07:49,569
I try to get everybody out.

5049
06:07:50,369 --> 06:07:53,590
Does she have his key?

5050
06:08:00,069 --> 06:08:00,549
What?

5051
06:08:00,549 --> 06:08:04,279
Oh, God.

5052
06:08:04,279 --> 06:08:04,680
Oh, God.

5053
06:08:04,680 --> 06:08:05,000
Oh, God.

5054
06:08:05,000 --> 06:08:05,159
Oh, God.

5055
06:08:05,159 --> 06:08:05,720
I don't know what to do.

5056
06:08:06,520 --> 06:08:07,759
I don't know what to do.

5057
06:08:09,189 --> 06:08:09,909
I don't know what to do.

5058
06:08:14,130 --> 06:08:15,330
He's got the drug cup.

5059
06:08:15,889 --> 06:08:21,319
This dude is dressed like the Riddler from Batman Forever.

5060
06:08:21,319 --> 06:08:24,130
Does he think, oh, yeah, I must have done this.

5061
06:08:24,130 --> 06:08:27,700
He's noticing it now.

5062
06:08:43,439 --> 06:08:54,689
It's our house now.

5063
06:08:54,689 --> 06:09:08,790
All right, that's OP as hell.

5064
06:09:08,790 --> 06:09:09,909
This whole thing is just fucked up.

5065
06:09:09,909 --> 06:09:11,669
All right, where's the magic mirror?

5066
06:09:11,669 --> 06:09:13,189
The magic ghost mirror?

5067
06:09:16,180 --> 06:09:17,540
All right, everybody back out.

5068
06:09:17,540 --> 06:09:18,900
Everybody back to the house.

5069
06:09:43,040 --> 06:09:43,840
That was awful.

5070
06:09:43,840 --> 06:09:44,479
It's okay, though.

5071
06:09:44,479 --> 06:09:47,889
All right, bring everybody back here.

5072
06:09:49,380 --> 06:09:50,979
We'll have a party here now.

5073
06:09:50,979 --> 06:09:53,909
Bring people here.

5074
06:09:56,470 --> 06:09:57,349
Bring here.

5075
06:09:58,069 --> 06:10:04,369
Bring them all here.

5076
06:10:04,369 --> 06:10:05,090
Everybody's here.

5077
06:10:05,729 --> 06:10:07,810
Here's the magic scary mirror.

5078
06:10:08,930 --> 06:10:10,529
Chant the bride's name.

5079
06:10:10,529 --> 06:10:11,729
Admire a new possession.

5080
06:10:11,729 --> 06:10:12,529
Protect self.

5081
06:10:12,529 --> 06:10:14,209
Chant multiple brides' names.

5082
06:10:21,680 --> 06:10:23,520
Well, here's what we're going to do.

5083
06:10:26,790 --> 06:10:30,209
We're going to invite everybody over here again.

5084
06:10:30,209 --> 06:10:30,849
What time is it?

5085
06:10:30,849 --> 06:10:31,490
Everybody.

5086
06:10:31,490 --> 06:10:32,049
How's everybody?

5087
06:10:32,770 --> 06:10:33,810
How are you doing?

5088
06:10:34,610 --> 06:10:34,930
Energy.

5089
06:10:35,569 --> 06:10:37,250
Tomorrow, we're going to have some people sleep.

5090
06:10:41,060 --> 06:10:45,939
And tomorrow, throw a party and then have Bloody Mary show up.

5091
06:10:46,500 --> 06:10:57,080
There's also the chaos book, too.

5092
06:10:57,080 --> 06:10:57,560
That's true.

5093
06:10:59,299 --> 06:11:02,319
I didn't have a bed, don't I?

5094
06:11:02,319 --> 06:11:03,360
People need to be energized.

5095
06:11:03,360 --> 06:11:04,639
I don't want people falling asleep.

5096
06:11:06,479 --> 06:11:08,959
You know what I mean?

5097
06:11:08,959 --> 06:11:10,479
Just go to bed on that couch right now.

5098
06:11:13,250 --> 06:11:14,849
I need to figure out how to get clothes on him again.

5099
06:11:22,340 --> 06:11:23,299
Sleep on the cat bed.

5100
06:11:25,650 --> 06:11:26,130
All right.

5101
06:11:26,130 --> 06:11:26,849
Everybody asleep?

5102
06:11:29,200 --> 06:11:29,919
How are we all doing?

5103
06:11:31,939 --> 06:11:33,939
Hey, I heard you became friends with Aya.

5104
06:11:33,939 --> 06:11:34,659
She's pretty cool.

5105
06:11:34,659 --> 06:11:35,459
That's my girlfriend.

5106
06:11:38,360 --> 06:11:38,680
Are you?

5107
06:11:38,680 --> 06:11:39,479
Yeah, you're asleep.

5108
06:11:41,970 --> 06:11:43,009
All right, everyone's almost there.

5109
06:11:43,889 --> 06:11:45,009
You're in the bed, too, right?

5110
06:11:45,009 --> 06:11:45,650
Okay, sleep.

5111
06:11:49,000 --> 06:11:50,360
Can I adopt the rat?

5112
06:11:50,360 --> 06:11:51,000
I don't think so.

5113
06:11:56,209 --> 06:11:57,569
Yeah, I use the genie.

5114
06:12:02,840 --> 06:12:04,119
All right, here we go.

5115
06:12:06,880 --> 06:12:07,919
Are you ready?

5116
06:12:07,919 --> 06:12:10,450
Time to throw a party.

5117
06:12:11,909 --> 06:12:13,430
Here comes a real murder mystery.

5118
06:12:14,150 --> 06:12:17,119
I'm going to get everybody here.

5119
06:12:17,119 --> 06:12:17,919
I'm going to lock the door

5120
06:12:17,919 --> 06:12:20,319
and I'm going to chant in front of the mirror.

5121
06:12:25,560 --> 06:12:26,680
I have no idea what's going to happen.

5122
06:12:32,819 --> 06:12:35,810
You get a club to join?

5123
06:12:41,380 --> 06:12:48,560
It's a Dragon Ball Z character.

5124
06:12:48,560 --> 06:12:56,310
What's wrong with you?

5125
06:12:57,189 --> 06:13:03,380
Where am I?

5126
06:13:03,380 --> 06:13:09,860
All right, set party through the phone.

5127
06:13:13,509 --> 06:13:14,709
Play a game, take a photo,

5128
06:13:20,630 --> 06:13:22,310
chat with, plan a social event.

5129
06:13:28,689 --> 06:13:29,569
A lot of people are already here.

5130
06:13:35,700 --> 06:13:37,139
Incognito costume party.

5131
06:13:39,459 --> 06:13:40,340
House party.

5132
06:13:40,340 --> 06:13:41,619
Yeah, house party.

5133
06:13:42,340 --> 06:13:44,119
I'm the host.

5134
06:13:45,490 --> 06:13:49,200
Me, here are a couple of guests.

5135
06:13:50,080 --> 06:13:52,229
Just these two.

5136
06:13:52,790 --> 06:13:54,869
Entertainer, hire somebody.

5137
06:13:55,430 --> 06:13:56,869
Mixologist, hire somebody.

5138
06:13:57,830 --> 06:13:59,029
Caterer, hire somebody.

5139
06:14:00,639 --> 06:14:02,240
Location is right here.

5140
06:14:03,409 --> 06:14:05,169
Wait, I know that this is my house.

5141
06:14:05,169 --> 06:14:07,619
Okay, let's go.

5142
06:14:10,869 --> 06:14:11,509
Dance party.

5143
06:14:12,069 --> 06:14:15,040
Just wait till everybody shows up.

5144
06:14:15,040 --> 06:14:15,599
I need food.

5145
06:14:34,240 --> 06:14:34,560
Bye.

5146
06:14:36,639 --> 06:14:37,840
All right, lock the door.

5147
06:14:37,840 --> 06:14:39,200
Lock the door, lock the door, lock the door.

5148
06:14:41,319 --> 06:14:42,680
You really just jumped the gun there.

5149
06:14:44,599 --> 06:14:45,880
Oh, come on.

5150
06:14:45,880 --> 06:14:47,479
No, stop fighting.

5151
06:14:47,479 --> 06:14:48,119
Where's the door?

5152
06:14:56,040 --> 06:14:56,680
Get in here.

5153
06:14:57,400 --> 06:15:07,220
Why did you do that?

5154
06:15:07,220 --> 06:15:08,419
What was the point of that?

5155
06:15:08,419 --> 06:15:10,180
We were, nobody even got in there yet.

5156
06:15:30,240 --> 06:15:31,119
This is lagging so much.

5157
06:15:34,069 --> 06:15:34,630
That's why.

5158
06:15:36,680 --> 06:15:37,479
Motherfuckers.

5159
06:15:37,479 --> 06:15:37,799
All right.

5160
06:15:39,919 --> 06:15:40,880
Lock door.

5161
06:15:41,840 --> 06:15:42,959
For everyone.

5162
06:15:52,229 --> 06:15:52,549
Okay.

5163
06:15:54,799 --> 06:15:55,759
Wait, who's this guy?

5164
06:15:56,479 --> 06:15:59,569
Get in here.

5165
06:16:01,409 --> 06:16:05,090
Allow access to Pauline.

5166
06:16:11,189 --> 06:16:11,750
Oh, fuck it.

5167
06:16:11,750 --> 06:16:12,790
That person's just gonna stay out there.

5168
06:16:12,790 --> 06:16:13,509
Everybody lock it.

5169
06:16:14,659 --> 06:16:17,139
All right, it's a dark and stormy night.

5170
06:16:17,139 --> 06:16:19,380
We have a handful of people in here.

5171
06:16:21,159 --> 06:16:23,700
Who wants to chant into the mirror?

5172
06:16:23,700 --> 06:16:25,299
How about blueberry?

5173
06:16:26,180 --> 06:16:27,619
Chant multiple brides' names.

5174
06:16:42,560 --> 06:16:47,750
Let's come over and hit this lady.

5175
06:16:48,389 --> 06:16:48,950
I don't get it.

5176
06:16:51,430 --> 06:16:52,709
Oh no, I get it.

5177
06:16:57,799 --> 06:16:58,599
Oh my God.

5178
06:17:01,970 --> 06:17:06,240
Oh, where's she going?

5179
06:17:13,009 --> 06:17:13,330
What?

5180
06:17:18,000 --> 06:17:18,720
Holy shit.

5181
06:17:30,209 --> 06:17:31,169
Nobody cares.

5182
06:17:31,889 --> 06:17:33,090
Now she's crying.

5183
06:17:47,860 --> 06:17:48,740
Who's out here?

5184
06:17:51,619 --> 06:17:53,299
Who's out there on the cell phone?

5185
06:18:01,009 --> 06:18:03,090
This is a lot more anti-climactic than I thought.

5186
06:18:04,849 --> 06:18:05,330
What?

5187
06:18:05,330 --> 06:18:06,130
Who just punched me?

5188
06:18:08,450 --> 06:18:09,009
Fuck off.

5189
06:18:15,779 --> 06:18:16,099
What?

5190
06:18:16,099 --> 06:18:16,419
Deal.

5191
06:18:20,549 --> 06:18:30,020
This is only when the chainsaw is still in the house.

5192
06:18:30,979 --> 06:18:32,020
Where's Bloody Mary?

5193
06:18:39,990 --> 06:18:40,950
Why am I outside?

5194
06:18:50,819 --> 06:18:51,220
All right.

5195
06:18:51,220 --> 06:18:51,939
You suck.

5196
06:18:56,709 --> 06:18:58,069
You're not even scary.

5197
06:19:15,200 --> 06:19:19,990
You're not even scary.

5198
06:19:29,650 --> 06:19:32,770
Is everybody hungry?

5199
06:19:36,759 --> 06:19:42,340
Get me away from the first person.

5200
06:19:48,200 --> 06:19:50,040
Am I gonna get arrested for killing the lady?

5201
06:19:52,950 --> 06:19:54,709
This is me getting in trouble.

5202
06:19:54,709 --> 06:19:55,669
Arrested for murder.

5203
06:19:56,470 --> 06:20:05,060
The cops can't even get in.

5204
06:20:05,060 --> 06:20:10,950
What?

5205
06:20:10,950 --> 06:20:11,830
What the fuck?

5206
06:20:12,470 --> 06:20:16,319
I don't understand what I'm seeing here.

5207
06:20:20,630 --> 06:20:23,840
Who just died?

5208
06:20:24,240 --> 06:20:26,240
It's a random person, I think.

5209
06:20:26,880 --> 06:20:31,080
So you can't kill her.

5210
06:20:31,080 --> 06:20:31,319
Okay.

5211
06:20:35,779 --> 06:20:37,139
I need to tell some jokes.

5212
06:20:38,020 --> 06:20:39,599
You're going straight to hell.

5213
06:21:14,000 --> 06:21:14,959
Start a fire.

5214
06:21:21,360 --> 06:21:23,119
There's just spawning in the town.

5215
06:21:23,840 --> 06:21:31,669
Hey.

5216
06:21:31,669 --> 06:21:38,979
This guy has a gun.

5217
06:21:45,909 --> 06:21:46,869
This lady.

5218
06:21:47,909 --> 06:21:49,830
Why is the genie here?

5219
06:21:49,830 --> 06:21:52,229
Why is it coming over here?

5220
06:21:59,560 --> 06:22:00,759
Good work.

5221
06:22:00,759 --> 06:22:01,400
You did it.

5222
06:22:05,119 --> 06:22:10,000
Where's the book?

5223
06:22:11,650 --> 06:22:12,610
They can't even get in the door.

5224
06:22:13,409 --> 06:22:16,630
The door is dead.

5225
06:22:17,520 --> 06:22:18,479
The door is locked.

5226
06:22:18,479 --> 06:22:19,360
Nobody can even get in.

5227
06:22:20,000 --> 06:22:23,880
All right.

5228
06:22:23,880 --> 06:22:24,439
Where's the book?

5229
06:22:25,000 --> 06:22:26,310
Wasn't there a book?

5230
06:22:26,310 --> 06:22:27,189
Where's the bookcase?

5231
06:22:30,639 --> 06:22:31,360
Read something.

5232
06:22:33,889 --> 06:22:34,209
Open.

5233
06:22:35,409 --> 06:22:35,810
Here it is.

5234
06:22:36,450 --> 06:22:37,490
The book of chaos.

5235
06:22:39,319 --> 06:22:40,520
Read the book of chaos.

5236
06:22:49,169 --> 06:22:49,889
Do you have it?

5237
06:22:49,889 --> 06:22:50,369
Where are you?

5238
06:23:00,639 --> 06:23:02,159
I can't even open the door.

5239
06:23:02,159 --> 06:23:02,799
Paul, wait.

5240
06:23:02,799 --> 06:23:03,599
Hold on.

5241
06:23:03,599 --> 06:23:05,119
Wasn't Paul the only one that could open the door?

5242
06:23:05,759 --> 06:23:07,220
All right.

5243
06:23:07,220 --> 06:23:07,700
Unlock it.

5244
06:23:09,270 --> 06:23:09,669
Unlock.

5245
06:23:09,669 --> 06:23:10,470
Everybody can come in now.

5246
06:23:10,470 --> 06:23:16,689
Get in.

5247
06:23:16,689 --> 06:23:18,209
Read the book of chaos.

5248
06:23:18,209 --> 06:23:20,119
Okay.

5249
06:23:20,119 --> 06:23:28,770
Now I can lock the door.

5250
06:23:28,770 --> 06:23:29,810
What the hell does this do?

5251
06:23:32,340 --> 06:23:35,430
Did somebody eat a piece of cake?

5252
06:23:39,650 --> 06:23:40,529
Don't worry, everybody.

5253
06:23:40,529 --> 06:23:44,310
I'll just open up the book of chaos and read it.

5254
06:23:45,029 --> 06:23:47,240
Did I not read it?

5255
06:23:47,880 --> 06:23:50,069
Am I taking it into the bathroom?

5256
06:23:56,040 --> 06:23:57,400
I wanted a better place to read.

5257
06:23:58,040 --> 06:24:01,319
Read it.

5258
06:24:01,319 --> 06:24:10,930
What happens when you read the whole thing?

5259
06:24:33,569 --> 06:24:34,369
What's going on?

5260
06:24:34,369 --> 06:24:35,009
Do something.

5261
06:24:42,759 --> 06:24:43,639
What happens here?

5262
06:24:48,340 --> 06:24:49,299
You're just crying.

5263
06:24:50,659 --> 06:24:53,639
I'm sorry.

5264
06:25:03,880 --> 06:25:05,240
I just had to make something happen.

5265
06:25:07,319 --> 06:25:08,520
This book doesn't do anything.

5266
06:25:09,759 --> 06:25:10,799
He can't read.

5267
06:25:11,599 --> 06:25:13,279
He's just pointing at the lines.

5268
06:25:13,279 --> 06:25:14,639
Oh, this one looks bright.

5269
06:25:14,639 --> 06:25:16,000
This one's different colored.

5270
06:25:16,639 --> 06:25:26,119
Look, he actually has to...

5271
06:25:26,119 --> 06:25:34,130
You all right?

5272
06:25:35,729 --> 06:25:36,049
Okay.

5273
06:25:39,840 --> 06:25:42,799
Guys, he actually has to learn how to read.

5274
06:25:42,799 --> 06:25:44,240
He has to learn to read first.

5275
06:25:50,950 --> 06:25:51,750
Galarga!

5276
06:25:54,720 --> 06:25:58,979
Nepha learned how to read.

5277
06:25:58,979 --> 06:26:00,500
Reading like the Necronomicon.

5278
06:26:07,360 --> 06:26:08,959
Just you wait when he's done finishing

5279
06:26:08,959 --> 06:26:10,400
and figuring out how to read this book.

5280
06:26:11,119 --> 06:26:12,319
All right, let's go make a baby.

5281
06:26:13,040 --> 06:26:14,080
Where is she?

5282
06:26:17,490 --> 06:26:20,680
All right, more choices.

5283
06:26:20,680 --> 06:26:21,400
Try for a baby.

5284
06:26:21,959 --> 06:26:29,159
Come on.

5285
06:26:30,180 --> 06:26:31,299
You finished reading the book?

5286
06:26:35,159 --> 06:26:36,759
Violence and Barry is violent.

5287
06:26:38,279 --> 06:26:41,139
Try for a baby.

5288
06:26:41,459 --> 06:26:54,360
Shift-click the ground to start a fire anywhere.

5289
06:26:57,439 --> 06:26:58,159
I don't have that.

5290
06:26:58,720 --> 06:27:01,430
Anybody in this bed?

5291
06:27:07,409 --> 06:27:07,909
Come on!

5292
06:27:08,849 --> 06:27:09,349
Where'd he go?

5293
06:27:23,330 --> 06:27:23,830
Let's go.

5294
06:27:26,470 --> 06:27:29,770
Okay.

5295
06:27:30,630 --> 06:27:31,669
I want a baby out of that.

5296
06:27:34,630 --> 06:27:35,990
You finished reading the book yet?

5297
06:27:37,299 --> 06:27:37,799
Where is it?

5298
06:27:38,419 --> 06:27:40,200
You don't just put a book like that down on the ground.

5299
06:27:41,000 --> 06:27:45,319
Where is it?

5300
06:27:49,880 --> 06:27:50,680
Oh, shit.

5301
06:27:50,680 --> 06:27:51,180
Where is it?

5302
06:27:51,720 --> 06:27:54,790
Somebody take it?

5303
06:27:55,509 --> 06:28:02,959
Where is everybody?

5304
06:28:09,779 --> 06:28:11,299
Carpet by the front door.

5305
06:28:18,639 --> 06:28:19,360
Baby?

5306
06:28:19,360 --> 06:28:24,790
What are you doing?

5307
06:28:27,509 --> 06:28:28,310
Oh, it's right here.

5308
06:28:32,020 --> 06:28:33,459
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5309
06:28:33,459 --> 06:28:34,099
Wait a minute.

5310
06:28:34,099 --> 06:28:35,459
Drown a Sim in pee.

5311
06:28:37,299 --> 06:28:38,259
Don't read that.

5312
06:28:38,900 --> 06:28:39,779
Don't read that.

5313
06:28:39,779 --> 06:28:40,279
Don't.

5314
06:28:40,500 --> 06:28:41,000
Hold on.

5315
06:28:41,540 --> 06:28:51,169
Who am I torturing?

5316
06:28:58,560 --> 06:28:59,360
Get that book back.

5317
06:29:04,319 --> 06:29:09,060
All right, put it down.

5318
06:29:09,939 --> 06:29:12,209
Okay, freeze Sim.

5319
06:29:14,790 --> 06:29:16,150
Uh, who's even up here?

5320
06:29:16,150 --> 06:29:16,950
Who's up here still?

5321
06:29:17,840 --> 06:29:18,639
This lady right here.

5322
06:29:19,279 --> 06:29:20,930
What does that do?

5323
06:29:21,650 --> 06:29:23,250
Do you actually just freeze them?

5324
06:29:23,250 --> 06:29:24,450
Like cold freeze them?

5325
06:29:28,520 --> 06:29:29,020
Holy shit.

5326
06:29:30,360 --> 06:29:30,860
Is she dead?

5327
06:29:47,080 --> 06:29:48,279
No, somebody picked it up again.

5328
06:30:05,700 --> 06:30:06,200
Bingo.

5329
06:30:41,569 --> 06:30:42,610
Is this person still alive?

5330
06:30:45,349 --> 06:30:45,830
Hello?

5331
06:30:45,830 --> 06:30:47,270
Hey, like I haven't been talking.

5332
06:30:48,369 --> 06:30:50,369
Hey, hey, hey, wait up.

5333
06:30:50,369 --> 06:30:51,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5334
06:30:53,110 --> 06:30:54,150
Excuse me.

5335
06:30:54,150 --> 06:30:55,590
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

5336
06:30:55,590 --> 06:30:56,090
Stop it.

5337
06:30:57,110 --> 06:30:57,610
You.

5338
06:30:58,310 --> 06:30:58,630
Get it.

5339
06:30:58,630 --> 06:30:59,189
You're done.

5340
06:30:59,189 --> 06:30:59,509
That's it.

5341
06:30:59,509 --> 06:31:00,310
That's enough out of you.

5342
06:31:02,130 --> 06:31:02,930
That's it from you.

5343
06:31:14,419 --> 06:31:15,299
They're both dead?

5344
06:31:15,860 --> 06:31:16,360
No.

5345
06:31:18,020 --> 06:31:18,740
Both dead.

5346
06:31:19,380 --> 06:31:20,659
Become best friends.

5347
06:31:32,740 --> 06:31:33,700
I've lost control.

5348
06:31:49,360 --> 06:31:50,720
It didn't even work.

5349
06:31:51,279 --> 06:31:54,009
He's like.

5350
06:31:56,709 --> 06:32:00,150
He is burnt to a fucking crisp.

5351
06:32:22,099 --> 06:32:24,500
Pause the game and everybody queue up to get hit by a car.

5352
06:32:27,459 --> 06:32:29,540
Oh, that's so funny.

5353
06:32:31,599 --> 06:32:33,919
Death is trying to put him out with the fire extinguisher.

5354
06:32:34,479 --> 06:32:35,520
No, this guy gets to live.

5355
06:32:38,020 --> 06:32:38,520
Fuck.

5356
06:32:38,919 --> 06:32:41,560
The car is just too good.

5357
06:32:41,560 --> 06:32:42,919
It really is the best thing ever.

5358
06:33:00,700 --> 06:33:01,900
Oh shit, save the game.

5359
06:33:03,180 --> 06:33:04,569
It's all right.

5360
06:33:04,569 --> 06:33:05,689
We still got the gnome.

5361
06:33:05,689 --> 06:33:07,369
We still have drug gnome.

5362
06:33:07,369 --> 06:33:08,500
Save game, save.

5363
06:33:08,500 --> 06:33:10,819
All right, I'll save game, save, save, wait, wait, save, save, save.

5364
06:33:10,819 --> 06:33:24,279
I don't think I even picked that lady to get hit by a car.

5365
06:33:25,669 --> 06:33:31,700
I'm fairly certain that that lady was not one that was selected.

5366
06:33:31,700 --> 06:33:32,659
I can't save the game.

5367
06:33:40,180 --> 06:33:41,540
I can't save the game.

5368
06:33:42,939 --> 06:33:43,439
Why?

5369
06:33:45,909 --> 06:33:47,830
I have, we're stuck here, guys.

5370
06:33:47,830 --> 06:33:49,029
I can't save it.

5371
06:33:54,919 --> 06:33:55,419
What?

5372
06:33:55,720 --> 06:33:57,080
What are you doing?

5373
06:33:57,080 --> 06:33:58,040
Why is it focusing on you?

5374
06:34:00,970 --> 06:34:02,250
Witness death, witness death.

5375
06:34:03,049 --> 06:34:09,959
Half the people are just locked up.

5376
06:34:09,959 --> 06:34:13,369
Why does this guy have a cake?

5377
06:34:14,250 --> 06:34:15,450
What are you bringing this for?

5378
06:34:15,450 --> 06:34:16,889
You're bringing a little mouse loaf.

5379
06:34:18,650 --> 06:34:20,099
The door is locked.

5380
06:34:20,099 --> 06:34:21,060
The cops can't get in.

5381
06:34:22,419 --> 06:34:32,380
All right, it's time for all hell to break, Liz.

5382
06:34:33,020 --> 06:34:42,650
Where is it?

5383
06:34:43,189 --> 06:34:48,060
Good luck.

5384
06:34:48,060 --> 06:34:48,860
Have fun, everybody.

5385
06:34:48,860 --> 06:34:56,040
I can't save it.

5386
06:34:56,040 --> 06:34:57,560
That was a million T-poses.

5387
06:34:58,279 --> 06:35:00,950
Who's even left alive?

5388
06:35:00,950 --> 06:35:01,509
Banana?

5389
06:35:01,509 --> 06:35:03,110
Who's gonna be left alive after all this?

5390
06:35:20,759 --> 06:35:22,729
All right, I can't, I don't even have to.

5391
06:35:34,630 --> 06:35:35,430
Oh, no.

5392
06:35:35,430 --> 06:35:36,709
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5393
06:35:39,180 --> 06:35:43,340
Like, this is, I have to, like, where's the, where,

5394
06:35:45,669 --> 06:35:47,110
I have to move somebody, I have to move.

5395
06:35:48,569 --> 06:35:49,450
Not the banana.

5396
06:35:50,009 --> 06:35:51,049
I gotta stop him.

5397
06:36:09,580 --> 06:36:10,220
God damn it.

5398
06:36:15,029 --> 06:36:15,430
Saved.

5399
06:36:16,630 --> 06:36:19,959
Okay, I can't do that.

5400
06:36:19,959 --> 06:36:20,759
No, now he's dead.

5401
06:36:20,759 --> 06:36:21,720
Now he's dead, now he's dead.

5402
06:36:25,689 --> 06:36:26,889
Undress him in puke.

5403
06:36:30,779 --> 06:36:38,700
Okay, so let's just get the door open again.

5404
06:36:40,680 --> 06:36:41,720
Unlock the door.

5405
06:36:41,720 --> 06:36:43,240
Invite the rest of the guests in.

5406
06:36:44,900 --> 06:36:45,619
Welcome everybody.

5407
06:36:45,619 --> 06:36:50,279
Okay, I still cannot save the game.

5408
06:36:50,279 --> 06:36:52,439
I want this guy, not only as a best friend,

5409
06:36:52,439 --> 06:36:53,479
I want him around forever.

5410
06:36:54,119 --> 06:36:55,259
I want to meet you.

5411
06:36:56,869 --> 06:36:58,069
Spare the banana.

5412
06:36:58,069 --> 06:36:59,509
Oh, shit, plead.

5413
06:36:59,509 --> 06:37:00,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5414
06:37:00,950 --> 06:37:01,669
I can't plead.

5415
06:37:02,470 --> 06:37:05,369
He's dead.

5416
06:37:06,419 --> 06:37:07,540
This guy's way more important.

5417
06:37:14,169 --> 06:37:15,290
Nobody knows what to do.

5418
06:37:15,290 --> 06:37:17,049
The whole game's just, like, soft-locked.

5419
06:37:20,200 --> 06:37:37,400
It's, the whole game is soft-locked.

5420
06:37:37,400 --> 06:37:38,279
No, plead.

5421
06:37:39,880 --> 06:37:41,720
Strengthen connection with the physical world.

5422
06:37:41,720 --> 06:37:42,200
Is this him?

5423
06:37:49,209 --> 06:37:49,930
No, come on.

5424
06:37:50,729 --> 06:37:54,580
Does it work?

5425
06:37:56,439 --> 06:37:58,279
No, it's Walter Sizemore.

5426
06:37:58,279 --> 06:37:58,680
I don't even know.

5427
06:37:58,680 --> 06:38:10,250
I, it has to be done.

5428
06:38:10,250 --> 06:38:10,889
God damn it.

5429
06:38:21,180 --> 06:38:21,500
What?

5430
06:38:34,040 --> 06:38:35,639
No, I wanted to make a baby with.

5431
06:38:47,669 --> 06:38:49,000
I can't even plead.

5432
06:38:56,709 --> 06:39:01,270
How do I, how do I Benedict Banana?

5433
06:39:01,270 --> 06:39:03,610
Mourn, mourn, polo.

5434
06:39:05,529 --> 06:39:08,090
Laugh at Peter.

5435
06:39:08,090 --> 06:39:22,250
That way Peter's, Peter, which one was Peter?

5436
06:39:22,250 --> 06:39:23,610
How do I, I can't plead.

5437
06:39:24,250 --> 06:39:24,490
Why?

5438
06:39:27,299 --> 06:39:27,860
Okay, there we go.

5439
06:39:27,860 --> 06:39:28,419
Plead for Lily.

5440
06:39:28,419 --> 06:39:31,830
Who cares?

5441
06:39:31,830 --> 06:39:32,709
Just getting a coffee.

5442
06:39:32,709 --> 06:39:33,270
Give me a break.

5443
06:39:34,950 --> 06:39:35,270
All right.

5444
06:39:36,310 --> 06:39:38,060
There's too many people that are dead.

5445
06:39:41,900 --> 06:39:42,459
All right, come on.

5446
06:39:43,900 --> 06:39:46,700
Plead for Benedict.

5447
06:39:48,819 --> 06:39:49,779
Plead for Benedict.

5448
06:39:49,779 --> 06:39:50,340
Bring him back.

5449
06:39:51,139 --> 06:39:51,380
No?

5450
06:39:51,939 --> 06:39:53,189
Been brought back to life.

5451
06:39:53,189 --> 06:39:55,110
All right, now Benedict, you plead for the grant.

5452
06:39:55,110 --> 06:39:55,909
I need to make a baby.

5453
06:39:56,470 --> 06:40:02,470
He's back.

5454
06:40:02,470 --> 06:40:11,259
Come on, get up.

5455
06:40:11,259 --> 06:40:15,139
Why are you not getting up?

5456
06:40:15,139 --> 06:40:15,700
Thank God.

5457
06:40:16,259 --> 06:40:18,740
All right, now I gotta plead for Peter Plumb's life.

5458
06:40:27,900 --> 06:40:28,619
Don't fight.

5459
06:40:28,619 --> 06:40:29,900
You just got brought back to life.

5460
06:40:32,340 --> 06:40:32,900
Seriously.

5461
06:40:33,619 --> 06:40:34,900
Do not do this right now.

5462
06:40:34,900 --> 06:40:36,180
You just got brought back to life.

5463
06:40:38,490 --> 06:40:39,529
Peter's super dead.

5464
06:40:39,529 --> 06:40:40,650
No, he can be brought back.

5465
06:40:43,770 --> 06:40:44,169
Hello?

5466
06:40:50,549 --> 06:40:53,189
Can you like move to UFC world or something?

5467
06:40:53,189 --> 06:40:54,630
We don't need you in Sims world.

5468
06:40:56,090 --> 06:40:56,409
Okay.

5469
06:40:57,369 --> 06:40:58,180
Plead.

5470
06:40:58,979 --> 06:41:10,950
Get out of here.

5471
06:41:10,950 --> 06:41:11,590
Go back to hell.

5472
06:41:12,229 --> 06:41:14,009
We gotta clean this plate.

5473
06:41:14,900 --> 06:41:15,299
He's back.

5474
06:41:22,549 --> 06:41:23,430
Get the fuck out of here.

5475
06:41:38,020 --> 06:41:38,819
Guarantee this works.

5476
06:41:47,540 --> 06:42:01,459
What are you doing?

5477
06:42:05,340 --> 06:42:06,220
Get out of here.

5478
06:42:11,909 --> 06:42:13,349
All right, we're aging you down.

5479
06:42:13,349 --> 06:42:14,869
It says you're like a baby.

5480
06:42:14,869 --> 06:42:15,830
And I'm like throwing you.

5481
06:42:16,630 --> 06:42:19,740
I'm throwing you back to hell.

5482
06:42:20,779 --> 06:42:21,580
It's actually working.

5483
06:42:22,889 --> 06:42:23,770
Wait, he's like...

5484
06:42:29,209 --> 06:42:30,970
That scared him, of all things.

5485
06:42:34,360 --> 06:42:35,159
She's pregnant?

5486
06:42:37,419 --> 06:42:42,139
No, she's not.

5487
06:42:47,450 --> 06:42:48,090
Is she pregnant?

5488
06:42:48,650 --> 06:42:49,130
Are you sure?

5489
06:42:49,770 --> 06:42:50,409
How can you tell?

5490
06:42:58,659 --> 06:42:59,779
Oh shit.

5491
06:42:59,779 --> 06:43:01,220
She actually might be pregnant.

5492
06:43:02,180 --> 06:43:02,580
Okay.

5493
06:43:03,139 --> 06:43:04,020
All right, here we go.

5494
06:43:04,020 --> 06:43:04,900
New sitcom.

5495
06:43:13,529 --> 06:43:17,290
Clean up.

5496
06:43:17,290 --> 06:43:19,049
Everybody clean, clean, clean, clean.

5497
06:43:19,049 --> 06:43:19,930
Get rid of the urns.

5498
06:43:20,490 --> 06:43:21,619
No more parties.

5499
06:43:26,099 --> 06:43:26,900
Release spirit.

5500
06:43:28,919 --> 06:43:29,959
How do I just delete them?

5501
06:43:32,970 --> 06:43:33,290
Release.

5502
06:43:36,630 --> 06:43:39,029
You're drinking a lot of coffee while you're pregnant.

5503
06:43:39,029 --> 06:43:39,830
That's not a good idea.

5504
06:43:47,529 --> 06:43:48,250
Booty.

5505
06:43:51,580 --> 06:43:52,459
Invite her to move in.

5506
06:43:56,279 --> 06:43:57,560
She already is, isn't she?

5507
06:43:58,119 --> 06:43:59,240
There's the apartment key.

5508
06:44:01,209 --> 06:44:02,090
Invite to...

5509
06:44:12,979 --> 06:44:13,220
Chat?

5510
06:44:13,220 --> 06:44:14,659
No, and travel?

5511
06:44:14,659 --> 06:44:15,299
No, no, no, no, no.

5512
06:44:16,490 --> 06:44:17,689
Friends, household.

5513
06:44:21,750 --> 06:44:23,349
Is there an actually add to household?

5514
06:44:26,470 --> 06:44:30,040
Invite to add to group.

5515
06:44:34,229 --> 06:44:35,509
More choices, maybe?

5516
06:44:35,509 --> 06:44:36,630
Clubs, more choices.

5517
06:44:38,939 --> 06:44:41,430
I have to marry her.

5518
06:44:43,400 --> 06:44:44,360
Well, I can't...

5519
06:44:44,360 --> 06:44:45,240
Can I do that?

5520
06:44:46,279 --> 06:44:47,159
As the banana?

5521
06:44:47,799 --> 06:44:55,819
All right, friendly.

5522
06:44:58,169 --> 06:45:00,409
Ask about giving when we discuss interests.

5523
06:45:00,409 --> 06:45:01,369
Complain about weather.

5524
06:45:02,250 --> 06:45:03,900
Get to know.

5525
06:45:04,779 --> 06:45:06,060
Propose crazy scheme.

5526
06:45:11,139 --> 06:45:16,619
Turn on sheets and then shift click.

5527
06:45:16,619 --> 06:45:17,500
Add to household.

5528
06:45:23,830 --> 06:45:24,950
Add to family.

5529
06:45:24,950 --> 06:45:25,430
Modify.

5530
06:45:27,400 --> 06:45:28,200
Add to family.

5531
06:45:28,759 --> 06:45:30,909
Bingo.

5532
06:45:33,259 --> 06:45:40,150
Okay, so pregnant, huh?

5533
06:45:40,709 --> 06:45:43,319
I need to get some sleep.

5534
06:45:46,630 --> 06:45:48,229
Now that I have less people to deal with.

5535
06:45:49,369 --> 06:45:50,250
Clean up the blood.

5536
06:45:53,849 --> 06:45:54,889
Mop up this bullshit.

5537
06:45:55,689 --> 06:45:56,729
Get rid of the urns.

5538
06:46:04,060 --> 06:46:05,099
So many people died.

5539
06:46:11,900 --> 06:46:12,700
Adopt the rat.

5540
06:46:12,700 --> 06:46:13,580
I wonder if it's possible.

5541
06:46:13,580 --> 06:46:13,979
Let's see.

5542
06:46:15,029 --> 06:46:15,669
How would I do that?

5543
06:46:15,669 --> 06:46:16,229
Through the phone?

5544
06:46:21,029 --> 06:46:22,069
Go to the vet?

5545
06:46:22,069 --> 06:46:25,900
The computer, okay.

5546
06:46:25,900 --> 06:46:27,099
Well, I deleted all the computers

5547
06:46:27,099 --> 06:46:28,540
because they were too addicted to the computers.

5548
06:46:32,040 --> 06:46:32,759
Remember?

5549
06:46:32,759 --> 06:46:36,409
I had to get rid of all of them.

5550
06:46:36,409 --> 06:46:41,029
There's no computer left in the house.

5551
06:46:46,340 --> 06:46:46,979
All right, computer.

5552
06:46:52,740 --> 06:46:53,619
What a nice one.

5553
06:46:54,180 --> 06:46:56,250
They're all locked.

5554
06:46:56,810 --> 06:46:58,200
All right, how about this one?

5555
06:46:58,200 --> 06:46:59,080
All in one PC.

5556
06:46:59,720 --> 06:47:04,889
Somebody's bedroom or something.

5557
06:47:07,849 --> 06:47:08,970
I can't put it in the bathtub.

5558
06:47:08,970 --> 06:47:09,369
Never mind.

5559
06:47:10,090 --> 06:47:11,750
Where was this?

5560
06:47:13,419 --> 06:47:14,139
Get a job?

5561
06:47:14,779 --> 06:47:16,729
Well, let's just put it right here for now.

5562
06:47:16,729 --> 06:47:17,130
Who cares?

5563
06:47:17,689 --> 06:47:23,180
Okay, let's go see if I can get...

5564
06:47:27,419 --> 06:47:28,380
Okay, write jokes.

5565
06:47:28,380 --> 06:47:29,020
More choices.

5566
06:47:29,900 --> 06:47:30,860
Career.

5567
06:47:30,860 --> 06:47:31,500
Household.

5568
06:47:32,759 --> 06:47:33,240
Adopt.

5569
06:47:33,959 --> 06:47:35,479
Adopt a dog.

5570
06:47:35,479 --> 06:47:36,439
Was it a dog?

5571
06:47:36,439 --> 06:47:37,240
Adopt.

5572
06:47:37,240 --> 06:47:37,959
Adopt a dog?

5573
06:47:44,810 --> 06:47:46,169
I still can't save the game.

5574
06:47:46,729 --> 06:47:49,720
Oh, it's because the adoption's in progress.

5575
06:47:49,720 --> 06:47:50,200
That's fine.

5576
06:48:00,310 --> 06:48:02,409
It's not there.

5577
06:48:02,970 --> 06:48:06,860
Sorry, guys.

5578
06:48:07,419 --> 06:48:10,680
What about a cat?

5579
06:48:20,459 --> 06:48:21,659
I have to adopt the cat.

5580
06:48:23,560 --> 06:48:23,799
No.

5581
06:48:26,250 --> 06:48:26,490
No.

5582
06:48:27,529 --> 06:48:30,869
I'll try the other one to see.

5583
06:48:40,250 --> 06:48:40,970
What the hell?

5584
06:48:46,779 --> 06:48:47,099
Nope.

5585
06:48:51,669 --> 06:48:52,950
You can buy those.

5586
06:48:53,590 --> 06:48:54,549
You can adopt kids.

5587
06:48:56,299 --> 06:48:59,819
All right, get rid of these so we can hurry this up.

5588
06:48:59,819 --> 06:49:00,939
Spirit world, release.

5589
06:49:03,419 --> 06:49:04,220
This one, please.

5590
06:49:04,939 --> 06:49:09,939
Come on, then we can feed...

5591
06:49:09,939 --> 06:49:10,979
I just gotta free us.

5592
06:49:10,979 --> 06:49:11,860
Free the spirit.

5593
06:49:12,419 --> 06:49:15,580
Goodbye.

5594
06:49:27,259 --> 06:49:27,500
No!

5595
06:49:50,340 --> 06:49:52,340
Oh, autonomous killing was on.

5596
06:49:53,610 --> 06:49:53,930
Still...

5597
06:49:54,569 --> 06:49:56,119
It's all right, I'll plead for his life.

5598
06:50:01,340 --> 06:50:01,819
Plead.

5599
06:50:01,819 --> 06:50:02,220
Plead.

5600
06:50:03,500 --> 06:50:04,459
Plead for Andy.

5601
06:50:06,180 --> 06:50:07,139
Plead for Andy.

5602
06:50:07,139 --> 06:50:07,779
Stop crying.

5603
06:50:07,779 --> 06:50:08,259
Get over there.

5604
06:50:29,880 --> 06:50:30,279
Demand.

5605
06:50:32,759 --> 06:50:35,990
Let him live.

5606
06:50:41,060 --> 06:50:41,299
No.

5607
06:50:58,520 --> 06:51:01,500
Well, now it's just these two that live in the house together.

5608
06:51:01,500 --> 06:51:19,000
God damn it.

5609
06:51:19,000 --> 06:51:21,880
Turn off auto kill.

5610
06:51:21,880 --> 06:51:25,720
He wanted to get rid of everybody else.

5611
06:51:25,720 --> 06:51:31,509
Where is it?

5612
06:51:31,509 --> 06:51:33,990
War choices, extreme violence, options.

5613
06:51:34,709 --> 06:51:36,900
Turn it off.

5614
06:51:36,900 --> 06:51:37,619
Disable.

5615
06:51:40,169 --> 06:51:41,450
Disable for everybody.

5616
06:51:42,009 --> 06:51:43,849
For everyone, not just this person.

5617
06:51:43,849 --> 06:51:46,819
That's okay.

5618
06:51:52,259 --> 06:51:54,020
Uh, for the whole household, right?

5619
06:51:54,580 --> 06:51:56,740
Why would I open...

5620
06:51:56,740 --> 06:51:57,299
What?

5621
06:52:07,349 --> 06:52:08,069
Is it disabled?

5622
06:52:24,900 --> 06:52:26,740
I figured it would be down next to the one that says enable.

5623
06:52:28,900 --> 06:52:29,220
All right.

5624
06:52:37,580 --> 06:52:38,939
So when does the baby come out?

5625
06:52:49,430 --> 06:52:50,150
Nine months?

5626
06:52:50,150 --> 06:52:52,069
It's a full nine months?

5627
06:52:52,069 --> 06:52:56,250
Is it gonna take that long?

5628
06:52:56,250 --> 06:53:01,580
It's real time?

5629
06:53:01,580 --> 06:53:08,860
Is it nine in-game months?

5630
06:53:08,860 --> 06:53:14,200
How long does a genie baby work?

5631
06:53:14,840 --> 06:53:17,080
I can't tell if that's smell or if that's genie lines.

5632
06:53:22,740 --> 06:53:23,220
All right.

5633
06:53:23,220 --> 06:53:24,580
Can clean up the house.

5634
06:53:25,529 --> 06:53:26,169
Open the door.

5635
06:53:26,169 --> 06:53:28,200
Unlock the door.

5636
06:53:28,200 --> 06:53:28,520
Right?

5637
06:53:28,520 --> 06:53:29,720
No, it's already open.

5638
06:53:29,720 --> 06:53:30,119
All right.

5639
06:53:30,119 --> 06:53:30,840
This guy's dead.

5640
06:53:35,500 --> 06:53:35,979
All right.

5641
06:53:38,299 --> 06:53:39,500
Clean up the house.

5642
06:53:42,009 --> 06:53:43,450
Clean, clean, clean.

5643
06:53:43,450 --> 06:53:43,770
God.

5644
06:53:47,479 --> 06:53:49,400
Let's check back on the save in nine months.

5645
06:53:50,040 --> 06:53:54,139
By the way, why would I not see the gnome?

5646
06:53:57,830 --> 06:54:00,119
I'm kind of concerned here.

5647
06:54:00,119 --> 06:54:00,599
Hold on.

5648
06:54:13,110 --> 06:54:14,069
Thank God he's okay.

5649
06:54:14,069 --> 06:54:14,709
All right.

5650
06:54:14,709 --> 06:54:28,779
How do I turn this off?

5651
06:54:29,659 --> 06:54:33,099
Why are there like five murder brides walking around town right now?

5652
06:54:41,939 --> 06:54:42,099
All right.

5653
06:54:42,099 --> 06:54:51,020
I'm gonna get a job.

5654
06:54:51,020 --> 06:54:51,740
Goodbye.

5655
06:54:51,740 --> 06:54:52,299
Release.

5656
06:54:52,299 --> 06:54:52,700
Release.

5657
06:54:54,470 --> 06:54:55,430
Release.

5658
06:54:55,430 --> 06:54:56,549
All of them.

5659
06:54:56,549 --> 06:55:02,020
Why can't I get rid of this?

5660
06:55:02,580 --> 06:55:03,639
Just take it.

5661
06:55:03,639 --> 06:55:04,040
Who cares?

5662
06:55:08,790 --> 06:55:09,270
All right.

5663
06:55:09,270 --> 06:55:12,470
Still, I did this many people died in here.

5664
06:55:12,470 --> 06:55:15,959
I don't remember this many people dying.

5665
06:55:15,959 --> 06:55:17,619
It's like 12 people.

5666
06:55:18,259 --> 06:55:35,720
Get them all out of here.

5667
06:55:35,720 --> 06:55:35,959
Good.

5668
06:55:36,520 --> 06:55:38,919
Clean up.

5669
06:55:38,919 --> 06:55:44,779
Clean up.

5670
06:55:44,779 --> 06:55:47,270
Don't release Peter Plum.

5671
06:55:47,270 --> 06:55:48,069
Why?

5672
06:55:48,069 --> 06:55:51,430
He'll be back.

5673
06:55:52,950 --> 06:56:00,439
He's gonna come out of here.

5674
06:56:00,439 --> 06:56:02,279
He deserves better.

5675
06:56:02,279 --> 06:56:05,180
All right.

5676
06:56:05,180 --> 06:56:05,659
How you doing?

5677
06:56:05,659 --> 06:56:08,439
Energy, hygiene, take a bath.

5678
06:56:08,439 --> 06:56:09,479
Take a bubble bath.

5679
06:56:09,479 --> 06:56:10,520
I think you deserve it.

5680
06:56:10,520 --> 06:56:14,040
How are you doing?

5681
06:56:17,139 --> 06:56:19,540
Almost ready to wake up.

5682
06:56:19,540 --> 06:56:20,259
Grab some food.

5683
06:56:22,619 --> 06:56:23,259
See what I'm saying?

5684
06:56:23,259 --> 06:56:25,020
I can't like play the Sims.

5685
06:56:25,020 --> 06:56:26,709
All right.

5686
06:56:26,709 --> 06:56:28,389
Let's get up and get some food.

5687
06:56:28,389 --> 06:56:29,110
Take a bath.

5688
06:56:30,759 --> 06:56:31,159
Okay.

5689
06:56:33,189 --> 06:56:34,950
People just were on fire burning.

5690
06:56:35,509 --> 06:56:37,029
Zombies were eating people.

5691
06:56:37,029 --> 06:56:41,419
What happens if the genie rubs the lamp?

5692
06:56:41,419 --> 06:56:55,610
That's kind of an interesting question.

5693
06:56:55,610 --> 06:56:56,169
All right.

5694
06:56:56,169 --> 06:56:56,569
Wake up.

5695
06:56:57,130 --> 06:57:03,029
That's enough sleep.

5696
06:57:03,029 --> 06:57:03,979
Get some food.

5697
06:57:06,939 --> 06:57:08,299
Grab some food from here.

5698
06:57:09,380 --> 06:57:10,340
Hire a caterer.

5699
06:57:10,900 --> 06:57:12,259
Just fucking have somebody fucking eat.

5700
06:57:13,139 --> 06:57:14,099
I don't want to make any food.

5701
06:57:23,720 --> 06:57:24,520
Sleep.

5702
06:57:25,720 --> 06:57:27,720
That's not the reaction you want somebody to have.

5703
06:57:31,659 --> 06:57:33,340
Get your breakfast catered.

5704
06:57:37,020 --> 06:57:38,540
What a piece of crap.

5705
06:57:53,580 --> 06:57:55,419
Didn't the entire Pizzaz family die?

5706
06:57:56,060 --> 06:58:09,139
All right.

5707
06:58:09,139 --> 06:58:10,259
Clean it all up.

5708
06:58:10,259 --> 06:58:12,119
Oh, I evicted them.

5709
06:58:13,720 --> 06:58:15,909
Well, take a look.

5710
06:58:15,909 --> 06:58:18,069
Now the doll comes full circle.

5711
06:58:18,790 --> 06:58:22,340
How are you doing?

5712
06:58:22,340 --> 06:58:22,659
Hungry?

5713
06:58:24,819 --> 06:58:25,060
Okay.

5714
06:58:25,060 --> 06:58:26,819
I gave you a hundred bucks to come here.

5715
06:58:26,819 --> 06:58:28,099
It wasn't a hundred dollars to join the family.

5716
06:58:28,099 --> 06:58:29,700
That was a hundred dollars to cater of food.

5717
06:58:30,810 --> 06:58:31,930
Cook a gourmet meal.

5718
06:58:32,569 --> 06:58:51,459
Now, wait, what?

5719
06:58:51,459 --> 06:58:52,020
What's going on?

5720
06:58:52,740 --> 06:58:53,540
What happened to my camera?

5721
06:58:54,659 --> 06:58:54,900
Alt?

5722
06:58:56,180 --> 06:58:56,819
Alt tab?

5723
06:58:56,819 --> 06:58:57,299
Alt?

5724
06:58:57,299 --> 06:58:57,939
What did I just do?

5725
06:59:05,060 --> 06:59:05,299
Huh?

5726
06:59:05,860 --> 06:59:11,479
Oh, shit.

5727
06:59:11,479 --> 06:59:11,799
Okay.

5728
06:59:13,080 --> 06:59:19,799
What is she making?

5729
06:59:20,360 --> 06:59:22,889
Didn't I, I ordered, I wanted breakfast.

5730
06:59:23,770 --> 06:59:28,200
What, is it vinegar?

5731
06:59:28,919 --> 06:59:30,279
What are you putting that in there for?

5732
06:59:46,169 --> 06:59:47,450
Is it hydrogen peroxide?

5733
06:59:47,450 --> 06:59:47,770
Really?

5734
06:59:54,630 --> 06:59:54,950
What?

5735
06:59:58,860 --> 07:00:00,139
A cake for breakfast.

5736
07:00:00,860 --> 07:00:12,229
All right.

5737
07:00:12,229 --> 07:00:14,150
Add like a, add a wetting topper.

5738
07:00:17,400 --> 07:00:21,270
No, how do I eat it?

5739
07:00:22,069 --> 07:00:31,450
Take a piece.

5740
07:00:32,090 --> 07:00:36,279
A cake for breakfast.

5741
07:00:37,400 --> 07:00:39,400
This is like a 12-year-old's house.

5742
07:00:40,119 --> 07:00:45,990
Do I not have a trash barrel?

5743
07:00:45,990 --> 07:00:47,029
It's right here.

5744
07:00:47,029 --> 07:00:47,430
Use it.

5745
07:00:48,229 --> 07:00:48,709
Dishes?

5746
07:00:48,709 --> 07:00:49,430
What's going on?

5747
07:00:53,130 --> 07:00:55,770
Is there a way for me to see how pregnant I am?

5748
07:01:08,619 --> 07:01:09,419
Very pregnant.

5749
07:01:12,279 --> 07:01:13,479
How do I know how pregnant?

5750
07:01:32,810 --> 07:01:33,849
Doesn't have a job.

5751
07:01:33,849 --> 07:01:34,810
Well, you're pregnant.

5752
07:01:37,779 --> 07:01:38,500
You just hang out.

5753
07:01:40,970 --> 07:01:44,659
I'm still sleeping.

5754
07:01:44,659 --> 07:01:51,369
Hover mouse over the pacifier for the trimester.

5755
07:01:55,400 --> 07:01:57,880
Second trimester in seven hours.

5756
07:02:01,000 --> 07:02:01,720
Oh, shit.

5757
07:02:03,000 --> 07:02:04,360
Second trimester coming up.

5758
07:02:05,560 --> 07:02:05,959
Let's see.

5759
07:02:06,759 --> 07:02:56,169
Oh, man.

5760
07:03:00,889 --> 07:03:02,009
Oh, what?

5761
07:03:02,569 --> 07:03:11,180
Hover over the thing.

5762
07:03:11,180 --> 07:03:15,110
No, it's okay.

5763
07:03:15,110 --> 07:03:15,430
We're good.

5764
07:03:24,409 --> 07:03:25,290
Guess.

5765
07:03:25,290 --> 07:03:26,919
I guess everything's fine.

5766
07:03:27,909 --> 07:03:33,189
That was a pretty wild debate right there.

5767
07:03:33,189 --> 07:03:39,319
It took it off and she was crying and it went to the bathroom.

5768
07:03:39,319 --> 07:03:41,240
Oh, that was not...

5769
07:03:41,240 --> 07:03:43,080
There's too many emotions going on right now.

5770
07:03:43,080 --> 07:04:10,680
From mourning...

5771
07:04:10,680 --> 07:04:13,000
From losing a good friend.

5772
07:04:15,909 --> 07:04:24,330
We took that way too seriously.

5773
07:04:24,330 --> 07:04:25,450
Oh, man.

5774
07:04:25,450 --> 07:04:26,009
That just...

5775
07:04:28,619 --> 07:04:29,259
Baby?

5776
07:04:29,259 --> 07:04:37,380
No, we're in a good mood.

5777
07:04:37,380 --> 07:04:38,900
Second trimester coming up.

5778
07:04:38,900 --> 07:04:43,380
This is a dirty ass toilet.

5779
07:04:43,380 --> 07:04:46,229
What are you doing?

5780
07:04:46,229 --> 07:04:46,790
Just sleeping?

5781
07:04:53,560 --> 07:04:55,930
Flush the toilet.

5782
07:04:55,930 --> 07:04:56,569
No, it's clean.

5783
07:05:00,459 --> 07:05:04,740
It's kind of concerning how long he's been asleep.

5784
07:05:05,779 --> 07:05:06,979
Uh, yeah.

5785
07:05:06,979 --> 07:05:08,740
It's been like three days.

5786
07:05:14,330 --> 07:05:17,130
He's been asleep for like 31 hours.

5787
07:05:24,549 --> 07:05:26,150
This game is fucked.

5788
07:05:26,150 --> 07:05:36,939
What is that, baby?

5789
07:05:36,939 --> 07:05:37,979
Second trimester.

5790
07:05:37,979 --> 07:05:39,099
How many trimesters are there?

5791
07:05:43,819 --> 07:05:44,139
Four?

5792
07:05:49,830 --> 07:05:58,419
How many periods are in a basketball game?

5793
07:05:58,419 --> 07:05:58,819
Three.

5794
07:05:58,819 --> 07:06:00,900
All right, let's get back to normal here.

5795
07:06:02,549 --> 07:06:03,029
Flirty.

5796
07:06:06,389 --> 07:06:07,669
Say trimester again.

5797
07:06:07,669 --> 07:06:08,389
Trimester.

5798
07:06:11,020 --> 07:06:12,459
Three-mester.

5799
07:06:12,459 --> 07:06:13,819
Oh, so dork.

5800
07:06:15,740 --> 07:06:16,619
Shoo-bee-row.

5801
07:06:19,479 --> 07:06:29,380
Okay.

5802
07:06:29,939 --> 07:06:35,020
So I wonder how long the third trimester is in the game.

5803
07:06:35,020 --> 07:06:35,900
I've never seen it before.

5804
07:06:37,180 --> 07:06:38,900
Floopy.

5805
07:06:40,500 --> 07:06:42,650
All right, get...

5806
07:06:44,810 --> 07:06:47,450
All right, quit lucid dreaming and wake the fuck up.

5807
07:06:48,680 --> 07:06:54,950
Up, up, up, up, get...

5808
07:06:55,590 --> 07:06:59,459
You're a lost cause.

5809
07:07:06,330 --> 07:07:07,610
Unpleasant conversation.

5810
07:07:14,439 --> 07:07:15,400
Tell gross joke.

5811
07:07:15,400 --> 07:07:16,200
Apologize.

5812
07:07:16,200 --> 07:07:16,759
Go away.

5813
07:07:19,180 --> 07:07:19,740
Mischief.

5814
07:07:20,380 --> 07:07:22,020
Give fake news.

5815
07:07:22,020 --> 07:07:23,779
Invite to fake party.

5816
07:07:23,779 --> 07:07:24,900
Lie about career.

5817
07:07:30,119 --> 07:07:30,919
Do an impression.

5818
07:07:41,500 --> 07:07:50,069
Get arrested for doing drugs?

5819
07:07:55,319 --> 07:07:56,119
Uh, hold on.

5820
07:08:14,439 --> 07:08:16,409
How fat can you make them?

5821
07:08:19,770 --> 07:08:26,599
You all right?

5822
07:08:26,599 --> 07:08:35,529
Why is everybody having...

5823
07:08:35,529 --> 07:08:36,569
Why is everybody panicking?

5824
07:08:38,279 --> 07:08:39,479
I'm at my limit.

5825
07:08:41,830 --> 07:08:42,950
Remembering a sim.

5826
07:08:45,669 --> 07:08:46,150
Two hours.

5827
07:08:47,450 --> 07:08:48,090
So close.

5828
07:08:48,970 --> 07:08:56,459
Is it laughing?

5829
07:09:00,180 --> 07:09:01,459
Everybody's just crying.

5830
07:09:02,020 --> 07:09:15,479
I can't even interact.

5831
07:09:17,139 --> 07:09:17,619
Get up.

5832
07:09:22,500 --> 07:09:27,509
All right, let's have a...

5833
07:09:27,509 --> 07:09:28,709
Let's cheer up.

5834
07:09:28,709 --> 07:09:32,939
Try to cheer up.

5835
07:09:32,939 --> 07:09:36,810
What's wrong?

5836
07:09:37,750 --> 07:09:38,790
What just happened?

5837
07:09:39,349 --> 07:09:41,590
Something unusual just happened to Penny out of nowhere

5838
07:09:41,590 --> 07:09:43,830
and so leave her scared for a couple of hours.

5839
07:09:44,470 --> 07:10:01,990
All right, let's go.

5840
07:10:03,189 --> 07:10:04,740
What are some drugs?

5841
07:10:05,380 --> 07:10:06,490
Just marijuana.

5842
07:10:07,130 --> 07:10:07,849
Isn't that a big deal?

5843
07:10:08,409 --> 07:10:20,900
Her game crashed and she cried about it.

5844
07:10:21,619 --> 07:10:25,959
Where are you running to?

5845
07:10:29,590 --> 07:10:29,990
Okay.

5846
07:10:31,029 --> 07:10:34,099
Third trimester in one day.

5847
07:10:34,979 --> 07:10:36,740
Last trimester.

5848
07:10:36,740 --> 07:10:40,419
Let's just...

5849
07:10:40,419 --> 07:10:40,900
Let's go.

5850
07:10:41,619 --> 07:10:42,500
How are they doing?

5851
07:10:42,500 --> 07:10:42,819
Food?

5852
07:10:43,380 --> 07:10:44,340
They're all right.

5853
07:10:44,340 --> 07:10:45,540
How you doing on food?

5854
07:10:45,540 --> 07:10:46,360
You're doing fine.

5855
07:10:51,860 --> 07:10:54,020
This dawn of this last day.

5856
07:10:58,599 --> 07:10:59,560
Pregnancy speedrun.

5857
07:11:01,459 --> 07:11:02,099
It's getting late.

5858
07:11:02,819 --> 07:11:08,299
It's almost 2 a.m. Eastern.

5859
07:11:09,259 --> 07:11:17,669
And as much as it is fun dicking around for 22 hours.

5860
07:11:19,740 --> 07:11:20,459
Remove the urn.

5861
07:11:22,259 --> 07:11:23,860
I can't even move it.

5862
07:11:23,860 --> 07:11:24,500
I can't get rid of it.

5863
07:11:24,500 --> 07:11:25,779
Just put it in your inventory.

5864
07:11:26,419 --> 07:11:39,000
Put the urn on as a hat.

5865
07:11:42,419 --> 07:11:43,380
The chaos book?

5866
07:11:43,380 --> 07:11:44,180
No, not yet.

5867
07:11:44,180 --> 07:11:45,380
I need to see this...

5868
07:11:45,380 --> 07:11:45,939
Wear this...

5869
07:11:45,939 --> 07:11:46,819
I need to see the pregnancy.

5870
07:11:46,819 --> 07:11:47,540
I've never seen it before.

5871
07:11:57,180 --> 07:11:58,700
You're in Nevada?

5872
07:11:58,700 --> 07:11:59,900
Yeah, I'm talking about for everybody else.

5873
07:12:00,459 --> 07:12:02,299
It's almost 11 p.m. for me right now.

5874
07:12:02,299 --> 07:12:05,590
But that means that it's almost 2 a.m.

5875
07:12:05,590 --> 07:12:09,130
For a bunch of people that are in America.

5876
07:12:09,130 --> 07:12:10,810
And forget about EU right now.

5877
07:12:11,529 --> 07:12:17,259
All right, getting there.

5878
07:12:17,259 --> 07:12:17,979
18 hours.

5879
07:12:18,779 --> 07:12:20,630
How do you have a baby delivered?

5880
07:12:25,159 --> 07:12:26,520
Throw this thing in the trash, please.

5881
07:12:31,189 --> 07:12:34,520
Do I have to have like a...

5882
07:12:34,520 --> 07:12:36,360
The hospital people at the doctor have to come out?

5883
07:12:36,360 --> 07:12:37,560
Do I have to go to the hospital?

5884
07:12:38,360 --> 07:12:43,049
What are you calling me?

5885
07:12:43,610 --> 07:12:46,889
Let's go down to the karaoke bar and sing some duets.

5886
07:12:46,889 --> 07:12:48,169
I've been practicing like crazy.

5887
07:12:50,869 --> 07:12:52,229
I was trying to say yes.

5888
07:12:55,740 --> 07:12:56,700
Never mind.

5889
07:13:05,020 --> 07:13:05,900
Baby's all I care about.

5890
07:13:05,900 --> 07:13:06,299
Let's go.

5891
07:13:11,819 --> 07:13:13,580
Put microwave on head and make food.

5892
07:13:22,360 --> 07:13:28,099
Am I gonna vaccinate the kid?

5893
07:13:28,099 --> 07:13:28,900
Oh, please.

5894
07:13:29,860 --> 07:13:30,259
All right.

5895
07:13:36,139 --> 07:13:36,860
Are you gonna...

5896
07:13:37,419 --> 07:13:37,740
What?

5897
07:13:37,740 --> 07:13:41,319
What's wrong?

5898
07:13:41,319 --> 07:13:42,200
Morning sickness.

5899
07:13:44,919 --> 07:13:46,360
And sore back.

5900
07:13:48,900 --> 07:13:50,099
You're almost through it.

5901
07:13:50,099 --> 07:13:51,139
It's almost over.

5902
07:13:58,200 --> 07:14:01,159
Anti-vaxxing is not politics.

5903
07:14:01,159 --> 07:14:03,159
No, I'm gonna vaccinate my goddamn baby.

5904
07:14:03,880 --> 07:14:15,779
12 hours.

5905
07:14:15,779 --> 07:14:16,259
Who's here?

5906
07:14:17,430 --> 07:14:17,990
Oh, it's me.

5907
07:14:18,549 --> 07:14:33,990
This cake has lasted a long time.

5908
07:14:35,430 --> 07:14:45,430
What happened to his banana costume?

5909
07:14:47,139 --> 07:14:47,860
My immersion.

5910
07:14:47,860 --> 07:14:49,060
It's now fall.

5911
07:14:49,060 --> 07:14:49,619
Prank day.

5912
07:14:59,450 --> 07:15:00,729
I'm not gonna go prank day.

5913
07:15:04,250 --> 07:15:05,770
End the holiday early.

5914
07:15:05,770 --> 07:15:06,939
Is it the next day?

5915
07:15:07,500 --> 07:15:15,770
Almost.

5916
07:15:16,409 --> 07:15:22,069
Prank day canceled.

5917
07:15:22,069 --> 07:15:29,049
All that matters is getting this baby out and away from this house.

5918
07:15:36,090 --> 07:15:36,889
Worst dream.

5919
07:15:36,889 --> 07:15:38,650
You ended prank day.

5920
07:15:38,650 --> 07:15:45,430
We already did prank day like eight hours ago.

5921
07:15:45,430 --> 07:15:46,069
What's going on?

5922
07:15:46,709 --> 07:15:48,900
Oh, she's puking.

5923
07:15:49,619 --> 07:15:58,340
Back to the computer.

5924
07:15:58,900 --> 07:16:04,090
What else can we do?

5925
07:16:04,090 --> 07:16:05,209
Practice programming.

5926
07:16:10,020 --> 07:16:10,819
How fresh.

5927
07:16:10,819 --> 07:16:11,619
You know what I've noticed?

5928
07:16:12,340 --> 07:16:16,119
Is anybody left?

5929
07:16:16,119 --> 07:16:18,340
I think we're the final...

5930
07:16:18,900 --> 07:16:21,720
There's nobody left.

5931
07:16:22,279 --> 07:16:27,159
The gnome is left.

5932
07:16:27,159 --> 07:16:27,400
Can I...

5933
07:16:27,400 --> 07:16:27,720
How do I...

5934
07:16:27,720 --> 07:16:28,599
I want to...

5935
07:16:28,599 --> 07:16:30,200
I'm just gonna bring the gnome over here.

5936
07:16:30,759 --> 07:16:34,729
Give me a second.

5937
07:16:34,729 --> 07:16:43,500
I'm gonna age the baby up when the baby gets here.

5938
07:16:43,500 --> 07:16:45,340
And let's see if it's just the dad again.

5939
07:16:45,340 --> 07:16:46,380
Let's see if we get Peter back.

5940
07:16:46,779 --> 07:17:04,299
Reincarnation through pregnancy.

5941
07:17:05,099 --> 07:17:17,380
Nothing like a pregnant woman buying illegal drugs.

5942
07:17:18,099 --> 07:17:21,290
How do I get him over here?

5943
07:17:21,930 --> 07:17:23,130
I need to call him, right?

5944
07:17:27,020 --> 07:17:28,139
How do I get you over here?

5945
07:17:35,139 --> 07:17:36,740
Have I explained why there's a ghost in the house?

5946
07:17:37,540 --> 07:17:38,419
Well, it's a genie.

5947
07:17:39,380 --> 07:17:45,060
Genie came out and started to socialize with everybody.

5948
07:17:45,060 --> 07:17:47,540
Granted a couple of real peace wishes.

5949
07:17:49,700 --> 07:17:52,099
That genie then fell in love with somebody in the house.

5950
07:17:53,610 --> 07:17:55,450
And then that person that she fell in love with

5951
07:17:56,490 --> 07:18:00,009
during a sims murder party died.

5952
07:18:00,009 --> 07:18:03,560
I've never met the gnome, so I can't invite him over.

5953
07:18:09,619 --> 07:18:09,939
Really?

5954
07:18:10,580 --> 07:18:12,790
God damn it.

5955
07:18:17,319 --> 07:18:20,119
Oh, then he like punched her in the face.

5956
07:18:20,119 --> 07:18:21,400
So I ran him over with a car.

5957
07:18:28,220 --> 07:18:28,939
All right, let's go.

5958
07:18:28,939 --> 07:18:29,500
Actually, you know what?

5959
07:18:29,500 --> 07:18:30,619
Let's save it here.

5960
07:18:30,619 --> 07:18:33,580
And I'm gonna go to the gnome's house.

5961
07:18:33,580 --> 07:18:42,680
Let's head to the gnome's house.

5962
07:18:44,169 --> 07:18:45,209
They'll be fine for a little while.

5963
07:18:46,009 --> 07:18:52,220
I need to get back to home worlds.

5964
07:18:52,220 --> 07:18:52,700
No, no, no, no.

5965
07:18:54,009 --> 07:18:54,810
Cancel this travel.

5966
07:18:54,810 --> 07:18:55,529
I have to just exit.

5967
07:18:57,509 --> 07:18:58,150
Manage worlds.

5968
07:18:58,709 --> 07:19:10,299
Let's take a look.

5969
07:19:10,299 --> 07:19:12,779
It's been a long time since we've even looked over here

5970
07:19:12,779 --> 07:19:13,900
and saw what was going on here.

5971
07:19:26,180 --> 07:19:27,639
All right.

5972
07:19:27,639 --> 07:19:29,900
So how are we doing?

5973
07:19:31,029 --> 07:19:31,669
Intro for it.

5974
07:19:31,669 --> 07:19:33,029
I don't think the gnome has left his house.

5975
07:19:37,419 --> 07:19:38,540
Uncomfortable.

5976
07:19:38,540 --> 07:19:45,189
I need you to go visit.

5977
07:19:45,830 --> 07:19:47,619
I want you to go visit somebody.

5978
07:19:50,779 --> 07:19:51,979
Nobody else knows who I am.

5979
07:19:56,630 --> 07:19:57,509
Stuck in the suit.

5980
07:19:57,509 --> 07:19:58,790
Yeah, he doesn't come out.

5981
07:19:58,790 --> 07:20:03,990
Is there a way I can just go visit the carrot?

5982
07:20:03,990 --> 07:20:04,389
Wait a minute.

5983
07:20:05,029 --> 07:20:07,689
What are they picketing out here?

5984
07:20:07,689 --> 07:20:13,209
What's going on here?

5985
07:20:29,580 --> 07:20:30,139
What does it say?

5986
07:20:38,119 --> 07:20:38,680
What does it say?

5987
07:20:39,959 --> 07:20:46,889
What is it?

5988
07:20:49,000 --> 07:20:49,479
I don't know.

5989
07:20:49,479 --> 07:20:51,979
Is it about the police?

5990
07:20:53,740 --> 07:20:55,509
About scales?

5991
07:20:56,630 --> 07:20:57,590
That just heard Russia.

5992
07:21:05,189 --> 07:21:05,750
Me too.

5993
07:21:06,389 --> 07:21:07,029
Me too.

5994
07:21:08,389 --> 07:21:10,069
I also believe this.

5995
07:21:10,069 --> 07:21:10,869
Whatever it is.

5996
07:21:12,119 --> 07:21:13,479
I believe that too.

5997
07:21:24,919 --> 07:21:25,479
I did.

5998
07:21:25,479 --> 07:21:26,439
He did it on his own.

5999
07:21:31,639 --> 07:21:33,319
You acquired the charisma skill.

6000
07:21:33,959 --> 07:21:37,939
Hey, that was fun.

6001
07:21:41,740 --> 07:21:48,860
So what do you guys do after?

6002
07:21:48,860 --> 07:21:49,419
What do you want to do?

6003
07:22:04,060 --> 07:22:12,220
You all right?

6004
07:22:22,459 --> 07:22:27,400
This guy's freaking me out.

6005
07:22:42,299 --> 07:22:44,139
No, no, no, no, no.

6006
07:22:44,139 --> 07:22:45,259
No violence.

6007
07:22:45,259 --> 07:22:49,849
Let's go.

6008
07:22:49,849 --> 07:22:51,770
Why am I just the person that's doing?

6009
07:22:51,770 --> 07:22:53,049
This really is the gnome.

6010
07:22:53,049 --> 07:22:56,680
This just is like Twitch chat, right?

6011
07:22:57,959 --> 07:23:00,650
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get out of this.

6012
07:23:02,259 --> 07:23:03,540
You took the trash out now.

6013
07:23:03,540 --> 07:23:04,900
I took the trash out now too.

6014
07:23:10,709 --> 07:23:21,110
Jeremy, you're gonna miss the birth?

6015
07:23:21,669 --> 07:23:22,150
No, I'm not.

6016
07:23:22,150 --> 07:23:22,950
We got plenty of time.

6017
07:23:23,590 --> 07:23:27,080
This bloody stinks.

6018
07:23:28,779 --> 07:23:29,740
Why would you do that?

6019
07:23:29,740 --> 07:23:31,099
I better not do that too.

6020
07:23:36,900 --> 07:23:41,180
I don't know what to do.

6021
07:23:44,500 --> 07:23:45,139
All right.

6022
07:23:45,139 --> 07:23:46,020
I'm glad he was fucked.

6023
07:23:46,659 --> 07:24:05,619
I hear police.

6024
07:24:09,700 --> 07:24:09,939
Hey.

6025
07:24:11,540 --> 07:24:12,979
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

6026
07:24:12,979 --> 07:24:14,340
I got something to ask you, lady.

6027
07:24:15,860 --> 07:24:19,450
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

6028
07:24:19,450 --> 07:24:21,130
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

6029
07:24:21,130 --> 07:24:21,689
Wait, please.

6030
07:24:23,720 --> 07:24:24,759
Forget about this guy.

6031
07:24:24,759 --> 07:24:26,119
Who cares about this guy?

6032
07:24:26,119 --> 07:24:26,360
Go.

6033
07:24:27,159 --> 07:24:30,470
Don't let her get away before talking and making a new friend.

6034
07:24:31,990 --> 07:24:37,540
Hey, come on.

6035
07:24:37,540 --> 07:24:38,500
No, don't let her go.

6036
07:24:40,439 --> 07:24:53,000
Uh, just go here then.

6037
07:24:53,000 --> 07:24:53,720
What are you doing?

6038
07:24:54,520 --> 07:25:06,380
Here's an opportunity.

6039
07:25:06,380 --> 07:25:07,020
Just get over here.

6040
07:25:47,180 --> 07:25:47,819
Call.

6041
07:25:47,819 --> 07:25:52,700
Call over.

6042
07:25:52,700 --> 07:25:53,659
Call over.

6043
07:25:53,659 --> 07:25:55,540
Why is this taking so long?

6044
07:25:56,790 --> 07:26:02,680
You're running by her.

6045
07:26:02,680 --> 07:26:03,080
All right.

6046
07:26:03,080 --> 07:26:04,759
You guys have to understand.

6047
07:26:04,759 --> 07:26:06,409
Look at the lower left.

6048
07:26:06,409 --> 07:26:23,340
I didn't do shit.

6049
07:26:23,340 --> 07:26:23,819
Finally.

6050
07:26:25,020 --> 07:26:25,819
My God.

6051
07:26:44,580 --> 07:26:46,500
Did she just hold back a pew?

6052
07:26:53,049 --> 07:26:53,930
At least I met her.

6053
07:26:54,729 --> 07:26:55,290
I met her.

6054
07:26:58,020 --> 07:26:59,540
Oh, she's gonna, is she gonna get birth?

6055
07:27:02,759 --> 07:27:03,240
Where are you going?

6056
07:27:03,240 --> 07:27:03,720
Where are you going?

6057
07:27:03,720 --> 07:27:07,209
Where are you going?

6058
07:27:07,209 --> 07:27:08,409
Oh, my TV is too big.

6059
07:27:08,409 --> 07:27:09,849
I gotta go check on it.

6060
07:27:09,849 --> 07:27:11,049
Am I gonna go chat with her?

6061
07:27:11,049 --> 07:27:11,290
All right.

6062
07:27:11,290 --> 07:27:12,409
I gotta get out of here.

6063
07:27:12,409 --> 07:27:12,729
Save.

6064
07:27:16,169 --> 07:27:16,889
Manage worlds.

6065
07:27:23,130 --> 07:27:27,689
She's gonna go watch the birth on his computer.

6066
07:27:27,689 --> 07:27:28,569
I gotta get back there.

6067
07:27:28,569 --> 07:27:29,529
I gotta get back and chat.

6068
07:27:30,090 --> 07:27:48,779
Yeah, he's going to watch the stream.

6069
07:27:48,779 --> 07:27:49,259
Here we go.

6070
07:27:55,220 --> 07:27:56,180
Give birth in.

6071
07:27:58,069 --> 07:27:58,549
Okay.

6072
07:27:59,270 --> 07:28:01,540
There's a moment everybody was waiting for.

6073
07:28:01,540 --> 07:28:04,409
The sim is nearly full term.

6074
07:28:04,409 --> 07:28:06,729
More than ready to have this kid and be done with it already.

6075
07:28:06,729 --> 07:28:08,490
Give birth very, very soon.

6076
07:28:09,049 --> 07:28:09,930
Invite the gnome over.

6077
07:28:09,930 --> 07:28:10,569
That's a good idea.

6078
07:28:26,299 --> 07:28:27,340
The gnome is watching the stream.

6079
07:28:27,340 --> 07:28:27,900
It's okay.

6080
07:28:27,900 --> 07:28:28,860
They can pause it.

6081
07:28:28,860 --> 07:28:31,060
They can see it in real life.

6082
07:28:31,060 --> 07:28:32,340
I'm Gnata Gnoblin.

6083
07:28:32,340 --> 07:28:32,979
I'll be right.

6084
07:28:32,979 --> 07:28:34,659
I forgot that's what the name of the character was.

6085
07:28:40,950 --> 07:28:41,909
Oh, boy.

6086
07:28:41,909 --> 07:28:42,790
Do I need a doctor?

6087
07:28:43,349 --> 07:28:48,040
There he is.

6088
07:28:50,630 --> 07:28:51,590
What's the meal you're gonna have?

6089
07:28:53,880 --> 07:28:54,279
Uh-oh.

6090
07:28:54,840 --> 07:28:59,819
The grilled cheese.

6091
07:29:19,939 --> 07:29:32,819
Car her and end the stream.

6092
07:29:32,819 --> 07:29:33,540
Uh, no.

6093
07:29:34,419 --> 07:29:35,540
Not before we see this baby.

6094
07:29:36,180 --> 07:29:38,740
Let's talk about the current drug market.

6095
07:29:38,740 --> 07:29:39,220
How is it?

6096
07:29:55,689 --> 07:29:56,810
All right.

6097
07:29:56,810 --> 07:29:57,450
Talk about the...

6098
07:29:58,810 --> 07:30:00,250
Discuss the current drug market.

6099
07:30:03,479 --> 07:30:04,200
Yeah, he like...

6100
07:30:04,200 --> 07:30:05,959
I really love trash.

6101
07:30:06,360 --> 07:30:07,319
Looking in trash.

6102
07:30:07,319 --> 07:30:08,040
Grabbing trash.

6103
07:30:08,040 --> 07:30:10,759
Just me and this lady have a big thing this afternoon.

6104
07:30:16,139 --> 07:30:17,419
Why would you buy a fake ID?

6105
07:30:19,049 --> 07:30:20,330
If you were like 30?

6106
07:30:23,459 --> 07:30:24,500
Invite the gnome to move in

6107
07:30:24,500 --> 07:30:26,259
after we buy like a hundred different drugs.

6108
07:30:34,520 --> 07:30:35,720
Let's talk about, uh...

6109
07:30:45,909 --> 07:30:46,630
You can have one of these.

6110
07:30:47,590 --> 07:30:49,430
A fake ID for the baby.

6111
07:31:06,520 --> 07:31:07,560
Are these high-quality drugs?

6112
07:31:12,900 --> 07:31:14,580
The pregnant lady is not gonna have any of these drugs.

6113
07:31:21,369 --> 07:31:23,369
I'm gonadogonoblin is unemployed.

6114
07:31:26,630 --> 07:31:27,669
Let's joke about the...

6115
07:31:29,110 --> 07:31:29,509
Where is she?

6116
07:31:34,470 --> 07:31:35,830
Oh, pardon me, Sam.

6117
07:31:39,049 --> 07:31:40,169
Joke about the cops.

6118
07:31:43,450 --> 07:31:44,250
Okay, what about, uh...

6119
07:31:47,130 --> 07:31:48,409
What else you got?

6120
07:31:48,409 --> 07:31:48,889
Drugs.

6121
07:31:49,849 --> 07:31:51,049
Drug dealing.

6122
07:31:51,049 --> 07:31:58,389
Inquire about selling amphetamine.

6123
07:31:58,389 --> 07:31:58,709
Really?

6124
07:32:07,270 --> 07:32:07,830
Where is she?

6125
07:32:08,470 --> 07:32:09,720
She's fine.

6126
07:32:10,360 --> 07:32:11,909
She's just drinking like an iced tea.

6127
07:32:19,610 --> 07:32:24,950
So, I'm going to sell drugs for the gnome.

6128
07:32:26,500 --> 07:32:27,459
Give me some.

6129
07:32:28,599 --> 07:32:29,639
Is that what's happening here?

6130
07:32:30,360 --> 07:32:35,619
That's not, that's not alcoholic.

6131
07:32:41,340 --> 07:32:41,819
Nightclub.

6132
07:32:43,700 --> 07:32:44,659
Don't do this to me.

6133
07:32:44,659 --> 07:32:46,099
Not right before the baby comes.

6134
07:32:55,909 --> 07:32:56,470
She's dead.

6135
07:33:05,880 --> 07:33:06,599
All right, let's go.

6136
07:33:21,750 --> 07:33:22,470
All right, so where's...

6137
07:33:24,860 --> 07:33:25,580
She's dead.

6138
07:33:43,619 --> 07:33:44,740
Wait, is she going home?

6139
07:33:45,459 --> 07:33:50,009
She's going home.

6140
07:33:50,009 --> 07:33:50,729
Why are you going home?

6141
07:33:50,729 --> 07:33:51,130
No, no, no.

6142
07:33:51,130 --> 07:33:52,389
Get over here.

6143
07:33:52,389 --> 07:33:53,029
Home?

6144
07:33:53,029 --> 07:33:55,270
No, come dance.

6145
07:34:05,619 --> 07:34:06,020
Lantern?

6146
07:34:06,020 --> 07:34:06,819
What are we gonna eat?

6147
07:34:12,580 --> 07:34:13,459
Let's dance.

6148
07:34:13,459 --> 07:34:14,500
Whoa, what was that noise?

6149
07:34:14,500 --> 07:34:15,139
That was loud.

6150
07:34:16,020 --> 07:34:16,659
What was that?

6151
07:34:23,669 --> 07:34:24,069
Ow.

6152
07:34:33,750 --> 07:34:35,110
Pauline Parrot.

6153
07:34:35,110 --> 07:34:36,150
R.I.P.

6154
07:34:36,150 --> 07:34:36,950
She's dead.

6155
07:34:49,099 --> 07:34:49,900
I don't understand.

6156
07:34:54,419 --> 07:34:55,939
Okay, uh, how do I...

6157
07:34:59,450 --> 07:35:02,119
Let's just remind her.

6158
07:35:06,409 --> 07:35:07,049
Dance battle.

6159
07:35:07,849 --> 07:35:10,009
Okay, that's fucking actually hurting my ears.

6160
07:35:15,290 --> 07:35:15,930
Seriously.

6161
07:35:18,040 --> 07:35:20,040
That lady just did the coke off the ground, I think.

6162
07:35:45,959 --> 07:35:47,959
That was not a dance battle.

6163
07:35:59,830 --> 07:36:00,470
Dance battle.

6164
07:36:00,470 --> 07:36:01,110
Dance battle.

6165
07:36:01,110 --> 07:36:02,150
Dance battle.

6166
07:36:02,150 --> 07:36:07,849
Oh, she loves this.

6167
07:36:07,849 --> 07:36:08,349
She...

6168
07:36:09,290 --> 07:36:09,790
What?

6169
07:36:14,119 --> 07:36:15,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

6170
07:36:17,180 --> 07:36:17,900
Wait, wait.

6171
07:36:19,740 --> 07:36:27,419
I didn't do it.

6172
07:36:28,380 --> 07:36:29,659
I didn't do that.

6173
07:36:30,459 --> 07:36:30,959
Uh...

6174
07:36:32,709 --> 07:36:34,229
I didn't do that.

6175
07:36:34,229 --> 07:36:34,729
Uh...

6176
07:36:40,229 --> 07:36:40,709
What?

6177
07:36:40,709 --> 07:36:41,669
What am I supposed...

6178
07:36:41,669 --> 07:36:42,950
I just wanted them to all...

6179
07:36:42,950 --> 07:36:43,349
She's...

6180
07:36:43,349 --> 07:36:43,849
Look at...

6181
07:36:44,790 --> 07:36:45,669
She's evil.

6182
07:36:46,549 --> 07:36:47,349
She's evil.

6183
07:36:48,150 --> 07:36:50,069
She likes being at music.

6184
07:36:50,069 --> 07:36:50,569
It's...

6185
07:36:50,569 --> 07:36:51,189
It's helpful.

6186
07:36:52,470 --> 07:37:06,599
All right, stop.

6187
07:37:09,540 --> 07:37:10,180
What?

6188
07:37:10,180 --> 07:37:16,389
Benedict just wants to stop.

6189
07:37:18,069 --> 07:37:19,990
He feels like throwing up, but though...

6190
07:37:20,630 --> 07:37:22,790
Through one of the pinpricks of altered realities,

6191
07:37:22,790 --> 07:37:25,189
he sees words wrapping around his vision saying,

6192
07:37:25,189 --> 07:37:27,189
if you throw up while on streams, you're gonna die.

6193
07:37:28,150 --> 07:37:28,650
What?

6194
07:37:29,189 --> 07:37:40,650
All right, get out of here.

6195
07:37:40,650 --> 07:37:41,849
You have to get out of here right now.

6196
07:37:42,900 --> 07:37:43,400
Out.

6197
07:37:45,770 --> 07:37:46,970
The Sim cannot go home.

6198
07:37:47,770 --> 07:37:48,270
Why?

6199
07:37:52,759 --> 07:37:54,279
She wasn't trying to leave before, guys.

6200
07:37:54,279 --> 07:37:54,759
She definitely...

6201
07:37:54,759 --> 07:37:55,799
That says she can't leave.

6202
07:38:11,060 --> 07:38:12,310
Get out of there.

6203
07:38:12,310 --> 07:38:12,810
Get over here.

6204
07:38:13,799 --> 07:38:14,680
You just sit over there.

6205
07:38:16,310 --> 07:38:17,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

6206
07:38:17,430 --> 07:38:17,930
Hey!

6207
07:38:21,700 --> 07:38:22,419
Shut it down.

6208
07:38:22,419 --> 07:38:22,919
Shut it down.

6209
07:38:24,150 --> 07:38:24,790
Shut it down.

6210
07:38:27,689 --> 07:38:28,490
Control panel.

6211
07:38:28,490 --> 07:38:28,990
Turn it off.

6212
07:39:08,950 --> 07:39:10,229
It's time for this to stop.

6213
07:39:14,180 --> 07:39:14,900
Everyone go home.

6214
07:39:38,099 --> 07:39:38,599
Out.

6215
07:39:39,220 --> 07:39:39,939
Party's over.

6216
07:39:39,939 --> 07:39:40,439
Out.

6217
07:39:44,380 --> 07:39:54,580
What do you mean you can't go home?

6218
07:40:27,450 --> 07:40:28,169
How do we leave?

6219
07:40:32,409 --> 07:40:33,369
I can't, like, control...

6220
07:40:33,369 --> 07:40:34,009
I can't leave.

6221
07:40:34,729 --> 07:40:35,450
What was that noise?

6222
07:40:37,979 --> 07:40:38,479
Hospital.

6223
07:40:41,450 --> 07:40:42,009
Everything's fine.

6224
07:40:43,659 --> 07:40:45,180
Hospital, hospital, hospital?

6225
07:40:45,900 --> 07:40:54,549
All right, hospital.

6226
07:40:54,549 --> 07:40:55,049
Let's go.

6227
07:40:55,509 --> 07:40:59,830
Where's the hospital?

6228
07:40:59,830 --> 07:41:37,509
Yeah, it's good enough.

6229
07:41:37,509 --> 07:41:49,319
Did we bring the whole party?

6230
07:41:49,560 --> 07:41:50,560
Whoa!

6231
07:41:55,529 --> 07:41:57,130
Baby's coming out any second here.

6232
07:42:02,360 --> 07:42:04,119
Everybody's coming into the vet.

6233
07:42:08,700 --> 07:42:12,810
All right, just go over here.

6234
07:42:13,610 --> 07:42:15,830
Just sit down.

6235
07:42:15,830 --> 07:42:16,389
On the couch.

6236
07:42:17,430 --> 07:42:17,930
Sit.

6237
07:42:18,869 --> 07:42:19,509
Everybody go.

6238
07:42:19,509 --> 07:42:20,150
Everybody together.

6239
07:42:20,150 --> 07:42:20,650
Go.

6240
07:42:25,459 --> 07:42:26,819
Whose dog is this?

6241
07:42:26,819 --> 07:42:30,069
That's a patient.

6242
07:42:30,069 --> 07:42:30,569
Okay.

6243
07:42:36,619 --> 07:42:37,819
Is this the guy we met at the party?

6244
07:42:44,150 --> 07:42:47,880
No, I'm not coming out yet.

6245
07:42:48,919 --> 07:42:50,229
You have any beds in here?

6246
07:42:57,430 --> 07:42:57,830
I need...

6247
07:42:57,830 --> 07:42:58,330
I need this.

6248
07:42:59,509 --> 07:43:00,009
What?!

6249
07:43:04,099 --> 07:43:04,599
Huh?

6250
07:43:04,900 --> 07:43:05,400
Huh?

6251
07:43:19,180 --> 07:43:20,439
They brought it back.

6252
07:43:26,200 --> 07:43:27,080
What was that noise?

6253
07:43:27,080 --> 07:43:28,439
I need to investigate.

6254
07:43:29,319 --> 07:43:30,279
Oh my god.

6255
07:43:30,279 --> 07:43:30,919
All right.

6256
07:43:30,919 --> 07:43:31,720
Can I please?

6257
07:43:32,520 --> 07:43:37,740
Is it baby?

6258
07:43:38,459 --> 07:43:42,439
Sim is at full term.

6259
07:43:46,389 --> 07:43:47,750
Go over there and just nap.

6260
07:43:47,750 --> 07:43:48,630
Forget about this shit.

6261
07:43:50,150 --> 07:43:50,650
Oh!

6262
07:43:59,540 --> 07:44:00,580
Use your phone.

6263
07:44:01,819 --> 07:44:02,319
For what?

6264
07:44:07,049 --> 07:44:08,490
Travel to the hospital?

6265
07:44:10,900 --> 07:44:11,459
There we go.

6266
07:44:11,459 --> 07:44:12,180
The doctor's appointment.

6267
07:44:12,900 --> 07:44:15,950
Here we go.

6268
07:44:56,119 --> 07:44:58,900
Where the hell is she?

6269
07:44:58,900 --> 07:45:01,349
Did she just go home?

6270
07:45:01,909 --> 07:45:12,279
She's just at the doctor.

6271
07:45:12,279 --> 07:45:13,000
I see, I see.

6272
07:45:13,000 --> 07:45:13,500
Okay.

6273
07:45:14,360 --> 07:45:15,000
Baby, come out.

6274
07:45:16,569 --> 07:45:17,130
Tired.

6275
07:45:17,130 --> 07:45:17,529
It's time.

6276
07:45:17,529 --> 07:45:18,409
We'll need to rest soon.

6277
07:45:18,409 --> 07:45:20,009
Becomes exhausted in three hours.

6278
07:45:20,009 --> 07:45:20,569
I gotta...

6279
07:45:20,569 --> 07:45:23,290
I'm trying to get you to go to sleep,

6280
07:45:23,290 --> 07:45:27,770
but everyone is causing problems and making it impossible.

6281
07:45:30,740 --> 07:45:31,380
Everybody come home.

6282
07:45:33,619 --> 07:45:34,500
Come on.

6283
07:45:34,500 --> 07:45:41,770
What's your emergency?

6284
07:45:41,770 --> 07:45:42,270
No.

6285
07:45:43,290 --> 07:45:48,979
Get out of the doctor!

6286
07:45:49,779 --> 07:45:53,720
What was that?

6287
07:45:54,340 --> 07:45:58,380
Who the hell is this?

6288
07:46:00,540 --> 07:46:01,849
Oh, it's another cop.

6289
07:46:01,849 --> 07:46:02,349
Okay.

6290
07:46:02,650 --> 07:46:05,529
She's almost done.

6291
07:46:06,330 --> 07:46:07,380
This baby's coming.

6292
07:46:23,669 --> 07:46:24,169
Baby!

6293
07:46:24,549 --> 07:46:30,790
Why am I saying goodbye?

6294
07:46:49,189 --> 07:46:49,689
What's wrong?

6295
07:46:50,630 --> 07:46:51,430
Okay, travel.

6296
07:46:52,389 --> 07:46:53,029
Take them all.

6297
07:46:55,049 --> 07:46:56,939
Where are we going?

6298
07:46:57,580 --> 07:47:09,560
Click on her.

6299
07:47:09,560 --> 07:47:10,520
That's what I just did.

6300
07:47:10,520 --> 07:47:10,919
All right.

6301
07:47:10,919 --> 07:47:11,560
Click on her.

6302
07:47:19,180 --> 07:47:19,900
Go home.

6303
07:47:24,459 --> 07:47:30,409
She's not in labor yet.

6304
07:47:30,409 --> 07:47:32,009
Yeah, I can't go to the hospital right now.

6305
07:47:36,979 --> 07:47:39,740
Click on the actual genie.

6306
07:47:39,740 --> 07:47:40,299
This is her.

6307
07:47:41,099 --> 07:47:43,580
She's going home.

6308
07:47:49,619 --> 07:47:58,659
Click on the lamp to have the baby.

6309
07:47:58,659 --> 07:48:00,099
No, that's not how it works.

6310
07:48:00,740 --> 07:48:03,299
You need to wait till you get the labor passive.

6311
07:48:04,020 --> 07:48:06,729
Yeah, so what are you guys talking about?

6312
07:48:07,369 --> 07:48:11,689
I have to go into labor first.

6313
07:48:12,330 --> 07:48:13,939
I can't do anything about this.

6314
07:48:14,659 --> 07:48:17,509
Are you just going to jubate me?

6315
07:48:18,389 --> 07:48:21,540
All right, I'll be ready.

6316
07:48:21,540 --> 07:48:22,740
Buy a bassinet from the store.

6317
07:48:28,360 --> 07:48:29,000
Like, baby.

6318
07:48:29,639 --> 07:48:43,909
Is it even here?

6319
07:48:50,860 --> 07:48:51,900
The crib doesn't work either.

6320
07:48:59,060 --> 07:48:59,860
Bedroom?

6321
07:48:59,860 --> 07:49:05,080
I have to buy a crib or the baby will not come.

6322
07:49:05,080 --> 07:49:05,580
Okay.

6323
07:49:09,029 --> 07:49:18,970
Wait, is that good enough?

6324
07:49:19,529 --> 07:49:24,299
That's not a crib.

6325
07:49:24,860 --> 07:49:25,740
There is no crib.

6326
07:49:55,419 --> 07:49:57,419
Where's this crib you're talking about?

6327
07:50:00,439 --> 07:50:01,720
I'm in the kids menu.

6328
07:50:02,279 --> 07:50:04,520
I'm in the kids menu right now.

6329
07:50:04,520 --> 07:50:08,950
Oh, you guys are just fucking with me.

6330
07:50:08,950 --> 07:50:09,590
All right, whatever.

6331
07:50:09,590 --> 07:50:15,619
Let's go.

6332
07:50:15,619 --> 07:50:16,819
There is no crib.

6333
07:50:16,819 --> 07:50:17,939
You don't have to have a crib.

6334
07:50:17,939 --> 07:50:21,299
Here, I'll put the school desk over here.

6335
07:50:21,299 --> 07:50:38,299
Just sleep in this bed.

6336
07:50:38,299 --> 07:50:47,380
Get that baby out.

6337
07:50:47,380 --> 07:50:52,630
Today, the crib comes with the baby.

6338
07:50:52,630 --> 07:50:53,349
I knew it.

6339
07:50:53,349 --> 07:50:56,060
A bunch of liars here.

6340
07:51:13,979 --> 07:51:14,939
I need to eat.

6341
07:51:14,939 --> 07:51:18,970
Penny's office.

6342
07:51:18,970 --> 07:51:20,090
Penny got a job?

6343
07:51:20,090 --> 07:51:46,900
Put a bassinet in your home

6344
07:51:46,900 --> 07:51:48,180
and you'll have the option to give birth

6345
07:51:48,180 --> 07:51:49,779
or give birth at the hospital.

6346
07:51:49,779 --> 07:51:51,819
We just looked.

6347
07:51:51,819 --> 07:51:52,619
It doesn't exist.

6348
07:52:04,169 --> 07:52:06,729
This thing is called the rockabye bassinet.

6349
07:52:10,540 --> 07:52:11,500
Oh my god.

6350
07:52:18,279 --> 07:52:19,319
Rockabye.

6351
07:52:19,319 --> 07:52:20,840
I couldn't do BA.

6352
07:52:22,819 --> 07:52:23,540
All right, let's go.

6353
07:52:23,540 --> 07:52:24,419
Let's get this over with.

6354
07:52:24,419 --> 07:52:25,779
It's been a long stream.

6355
07:52:25,779 --> 07:52:29,270
It's been a long day.

6356
07:52:29,270 --> 07:52:30,630
Let's get this fucking baby out.

6357
07:52:59,209 --> 07:53:01,130
Oh, you could cook.

6358
07:53:01,130 --> 07:53:01,689
Good.

6359
07:53:01,689 --> 07:53:04,169
Still waiting for it.

6360
07:53:15,580 --> 07:53:18,299
Well, I actually just typed it and looked it up.

6361
07:53:21,799 --> 07:53:27,319
Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

6362
07:53:27,319 --> 07:53:28,680
No, god damn it.

6363
07:53:28,680 --> 07:53:36,279
Where is it?

6364
07:53:36,279 --> 07:53:37,319
What's at work?

6365
07:53:39,880 --> 07:53:51,349
Where's the gnome?

6366
07:53:51,349 --> 07:53:54,650
All right, come on.

6367
07:53:54,650 --> 07:53:55,130
Hurry up.

6368
07:54:02,009 --> 07:54:04,150
It's so late.

6369
07:54:04,150 --> 07:54:07,349
It's almost 3 a.m. Eastern right now.

6370
07:54:07,349 --> 07:54:09,430
We can't go to bed until this happens.

6371
07:54:09,430 --> 07:54:18,779
Just give it a minute.

6372
07:54:18,779 --> 07:54:38,310
What a day of work.

6373
07:54:38,310 --> 07:54:39,509
Penny came home and made it.

6374
07:54:39,509 --> 07:54:41,669
I thought that was just sort of $1.12.

6375
07:54:42,310 --> 07:54:44,490
I was like, what the hell did you do for work?

6376
07:54:46,459 --> 07:54:47,099
All right, get up.

6377
07:54:53,619 --> 07:54:58,200
Uh, is he going to leave that like that?

6378
07:54:59,849 --> 07:55:00,169
Really?

6379
07:55:09,450 --> 07:55:10,889
Fix that dickhead.

6380
07:55:11,450 --> 07:55:13,349
Oh, she's out of jail.

6381
07:55:17,830 --> 07:55:19,270
I don't know how she's alive.

6382
07:55:21,720 --> 07:55:25,080
Oh, this lady sucks.

6383
07:55:28,360 --> 07:55:30,119
I took I took her wig.

6384
07:55:41,340 --> 07:55:42,299
What the fuck?

6385
07:55:45,459 --> 07:55:46,900
I'm going to lose my mind.

6386
07:55:47,619 --> 07:55:49,720
I'm going to lose my mind.

6387
07:56:00,939 --> 07:56:04,229
I hate this, but I love it at the same time.

6388
07:56:08,759 --> 07:56:09,479
Okay, did you?

6389
07:56:09,479 --> 07:56:11,159
There's no more hair for you to take out.

6390
07:56:11,720 --> 07:56:14,360
Why do you hate this girl so much?

6391
07:56:17,029 --> 07:56:18,229
What did she do to you?

6392
07:56:26,060 --> 07:56:26,700
Where did she go?

6393
07:56:27,259 --> 07:56:30,180
All right, well, whatever.

6394
07:56:30,180 --> 07:56:34,580
I don't know why they hate each other so much.

6395
07:56:52,680 --> 07:56:53,080
Okay.

6396
07:56:56,549 --> 07:56:57,430
Enjoy your coffee.

6397
07:56:58,729 --> 07:57:01,049
I'm just waiting for this stupid baby to come up.

6398
07:57:01,689 --> 07:57:06,819
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

6399
07:57:06,819 --> 07:57:07,220
Here we go.

6400
07:57:07,220 --> 07:57:07,540
Here we go.

6401
07:57:07,540 --> 07:57:08,259
Here we go.

6402
07:57:08,259 --> 07:57:08,500
All right.

6403
07:57:08,500 --> 07:57:08,900
What do we do?

6404
07:57:08,900 --> 07:57:09,380
What do we do?

6405
07:57:10,630 --> 07:57:11,509
Going into labor.

6406
07:57:11,509 --> 07:57:12,790
We're going to bring everybody to the hospital.

6407
07:57:13,349 --> 07:57:15,270
Wait, invite the gnome over quick.

6408
07:57:15,270 --> 07:57:15,990
Call the gnome.

6409
07:57:15,990 --> 07:57:16,630
Call, call the gnome.

6410
07:57:16,630 --> 07:57:17,830
Call the gnome, gnome, gnome, gnome, gnome.

6411
07:57:17,830 --> 07:57:18,310
Call the gnome.

6412
07:57:23,270 --> 07:57:24,790
No, you don't know the gnome.

6413
07:57:24,790 --> 07:57:31,500
Call the gnome.

6414
07:57:31,500 --> 07:57:31,740
Quick.

6415
07:57:37,909 --> 07:57:39,110
Okay, get up everybody.

6416
07:57:39,110 --> 07:57:39,830
Hospital, let's go.

6417
07:57:40,470 --> 07:57:48,950
All right, the gnome's here.

6418
07:57:48,950 --> 07:57:49,509
Half baby.

6419
07:57:50,069 --> 07:57:54,549
This is the moment of truth.

6420
07:57:54,549 --> 07:57:56,310
We've been waiting for this for like three hours.

6421
07:57:57,779 --> 07:57:58,340
Here we go.

6422
07:57:59,060 --> 07:58:05,639
Did you just get you?

6423
07:58:05,639 --> 07:58:07,080
Wait, you didn't just drop it in here?

6424
07:58:12,299 --> 07:58:18,810
Uh, congratulations.

6425
07:58:18,810 --> 07:58:19,770
It's a boy.

6426
07:58:19,770 --> 07:58:21,450
I just gave birth to a baby boy.

6427
07:58:21,450 --> 07:58:22,409
This baby needs a name.

6428
07:59:37,319 --> 07:59:40,650
That's, that's fucking ridiculous.

6429
07:59:42,220 --> 07:59:43,180
What is that noise?

6430
07:59:44,060 --> 08:00:01,099
All right, it's time for the baby to grow up.

6431
08:00:08,900 --> 08:00:11,060
Doc, you get away from that baby.

6432
08:00:11,779 --> 08:00:13,060
Get away from that baby.

6433
08:00:13,060 --> 08:00:14,020
Get away from the baby.

6434
08:00:15,340 --> 08:00:15,819
Get away.

6435
08:00:17,479 --> 08:00:18,919
Get the fuck away from that baby.

6436
08:00:19,560 --> 08:00:20,200
Get out of here.

6437
08:00:21,319 --> 08:00:22,759
You motherfucker.

6438
08:00:22,759 --> 08:00:24,360
No, don't touch that baby.

6439
08:00:27,060 --> 08:00:28,020
Somebody help.

6440
08:00:29,500 --> 08:00:30,139
No, neither.

6441
08:00:30,139 --> 08:00:30,779
You either.

6442
08:00:30,779 --> 08:00:31,819
You go back over here.

6443
08:00:39,540 --> 08:00:40,819
Get over to the baby.

6444
08:00:40,819 --> 08:00:42,900
Stop doing what just happened.

6445
08:00:48,919 --> 08:00:51,799
Okay, get over, get over here.

6446
08:00:53,659 --> 08:00:55,659
Somebody pick up the baby.

6447
08:00:56,220 --> 08:00:57,500
Somebody pick up the baby.

6448
08:01:01,819 --> 08:01:03,259
Okay, thank you.

6449
08:01:08,220 --> 08:01:21,369
Wasn't gonna let that motherfucker get near this baby.

6450
08:01:21,369 --> 08:01:22,810
Why is the gnome here?

6451
08:01:22,810 --> 08:01:24,569
Oh yeah, I invited the gnome over.

6452
08:01:25,659 --> 08:01:27,259
All right, I got, I'm done.

6453
08:01:27,259 --> 08:01:27,580
I'm done.

6454
08:01:27,580 --> 08:01:28,299
I'm going to bed.

6455
08:01:30,169 --> 08:01:31,770
I can't fucking handle this anymore.

6456
08:01:36,630 --> 08:01:37,830
I'm gonna age the baby.

6457
08:01:38,790 --> 08:01:43,750
All right, age up.

6458
08:01:43,750 --> 08:01:45,580
Here we go.

6459
08:01:45,580 --> 08:01:49,049
Let's see who you grow.

6460
08:01:49,049 --> 08:01:50,569
Wait, did I just do that to her?

6461
08:01:50,569 --> 08:01:51,700
Who did I just do that to?

6462
08:02:01,770 --> 08:02:03,529
I just made her older.

6463
08:02:08,520 --> 08:02:11,479
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

6464
08:02:12,979 --> 08:02:13,700
Get off.

6465
08:02:13,700 --> 08:02:14,180
Get away.

6466
08:02:14,180 --> 08:02:14,500
Get away.

6467
08:02:14,500 --> 08:02:14,819
Get away.

6468
08:02:14,819 --> 08:02:15,139
Get away.

6469
08:02:15,139 --> 08:02:15,540
Get away.

6470
08:02:15,540 --> 08:02:16,020
Get away.

6471
08:02:16,020 --> 08:02:16,900
Don't feed them.

6472
08:02:16,900 --> 08:02:18,180
Don't feed that baby.

6473
08:02:18,180 --> 08:02:18,819
Put it down.

6474
08:02:20,680 --> 08:02:21,959
Do not feed this baby.

6475
08:02:24,340 --> 08:02:25,459
Watch the baby.

6476
08:02:36,599 --> 08:02:37,159
Oh no.

6477
08:02:38,139 --> 08:02:39,340
No, the gnome is fine.

6478
08:02:39,340 --> 08:02:40,700
The gnome is gonna be just fine.

6479
08:02:42,740 --> 08:02:44,810
I trust the gnome.

6480
08:02:44,810 --> 08:02:46,090
That's weird for me to say that.

6481
08:02:46,090 --> 08:02:46,729
Excuse me.

6482
08:02:49,349 --> 08:02:50,069
Huh?

6483
08:02:50,069 --> 08:02:52,229
Oh, I thought she just cast a magic spell.

6484
08:02:56,389 --> 08:02:58,069
Toddler's day spent playing with toys,

6485
08:02:58,069 --> 08:02:58,709
exploring the world,

6486
08:02:58,709 --> 08:03:00,709
and learning to communicate with words instead of tears.

6487
08:03:01,349 --> 08:03:03,909
Oh wait, this is the perfect time to start skill building.

6488
08:03:05,819 --> 08:03:06,220
Okay.

6489
08:03:08,979 --> 08:03:09,700
Inquisitive.

6490
08:03:27,049 --> 08:03:29,209
All right, here we go.

6491
08:03:30,409 --> 08:03:32,090
How I need to I want to age.

6492
08:03:33,450 --> 08:03:34,009
Age up.

6493
08:03:35,299 --> 08:03:36,180
Age up.

6494
08:03:36,180 --> 08:03:41,900
Did age up work?

6495
08:03:45,860 --> 08:03:47,860
Okay, Peter aged up.

6496
08:03:47,860 --> 08:03:48,740
Aspirations.

6497
08:03:48,740 --> 08:03:50,659
All right, creativity.

6498
08:03:50,659 --> 08:03:51,619
That sounds good to me.

6499
08:03:53,130 --> 08:03:55,659
And cheerful.

6500
08:03:55,659 --> 08:03:56,459
That sounds pretty good.

6501
08:03:59,180 --> 08:04:03,770
Okay.

6502
08:04:09,450 --> 08:04:10,169
Creativity.

6503
08:04:14,169 --> 08:04:15,529
A botanist.

6504
08:04:15,529 --> 08:04:15,770
Sure.

6505
08:04:17,939 --> 08:04:19,139
And a romantic.

6506
08:04:19,139 --> 08:04:19,540
Come on.

6507
08:04:23,020 --> 08:04:29,029
Actually, dude, what a fucking insane childhood you have.

6508
08:04:31,290 --> 08:04:32,490
You're just crying.

6509
08:04:33,290 --> 08:04:38,419
You have the mental, you have the brain of a one-day-old.

6510
08:04:38,979 --> 08:04:41,130
How did you, you already got your phone?

6511
08:04:43,479 --> 08:04:43,959
All right.

6512
08:05:06,630 --> 08:05:13,380
Okay, I lost my mind.

6513
08:05:13,380 --> 08:05:14,180
I gotta get out of here.

6514
08:05:17,130 --> 08:05:23,509
Hey, we watched him grow up.

6515
08:05:27,220 --> 08:05:28,259
I'm never doing this again.

6516
08:05:41,849 --> 08:05:43,369
Someone just said you're a mean person.

6517
08:05:44,009 --> 08:05:53,580
That didn't take eight hours.

6518
08:05:54,779 --> 08:05:56,220
I was like, I'll bring him back.

6519
08:05:56,860 --> 08:05:57,659
I'll bring him back.

6520
08:05:58,700 --> 08:05:59,340
Just wait.

6521
08:05:59,340 --> 08:06:00,220
I'll bring him back.

6522
08:06:00,220 --> 08:06:01,900
Everybody settle down.

6523
08:06:04,889 --> 08:06:05,849
Plead for Peter.

6524
08:06:15,849 --> 08:06:17,450
And it has been accepted.

6525
08:06:18,330 --> 08:06:33,529
What's the cheat for it?

6526
08:06:33,529 --> 08:06:33,610
What?

6527
08:06:33,610 --> 08:06:34,090
How do I cheat?

6528
08:06:35,529 --> 08:06:38,380
How do I bring him back?

6529
08:06:38,380 --> 08:06:39,099
What's the cheat for it?

6530
08:06:46,229 --> 08:06:47,189
There is no cheat for it.

6531
08:07:04,740 --> 08:07:09,080
That was so uncalled for.

6532
08:07:09,799 --> 08:07:17,930
Oh, at least he got to get to like 32.

6533
08:07:17,930 --> 08:07:22,299
You know, he went from an infant to like 40.

6534
08:07:34,729 --> 08:07:35,849
32 seconds.

6535
08:07:35,849 --> 08:07:36,729
Finish the fight.

6536
08:07:36,729 --> 08:07:37,689
There is no fight.

6537
08:07:47,750 --> 08:08:00,950
No, this is a gnome stream, no.

6538
08:08:07,290 --> 08:08:15,540
I got a fucking headache.

6539
08:08:19,139 --> 08:08:19,779
What a joke.

6540
08:08:21,799 --> 08:08:28,419
Yeah, I need a cup of coffee after that one.

6541
08:08:29,060 --> 08:08:33,669
He lived until 32 in a bathroom.

6542
08:08:57,580 --> 08:09:07,720
Let me just like seriously like applaud the Sims 4 modding community.

6543
08:09:07,720 --> 08:09:08,840
What a hell of a job.

6544
08:09:08,840 --> 08:09:11,900
Like how much outrageous shit.

6545
08:09:11,900 --> 08:09:13,740
I can't even believe this stuff is even in the game.

6546
08:09:14,619 --> 08:09:19,139
Did it once before, did it again.

6547
08:09:19,139 --> 08:09:22,259
And there's still somehow interesting things to look at.

6548
08:09:27,349 --> 08:09:28,889
My eyes are itchy.

6549
08:09:31,720 --> 08:09:33,319
All right, I think that's going to be it.

6550
08:09:34,279 --> 08:09:35,400
Here's who's left standing.

6551
08:09:38,180 --> 08:09:38,740
The genie.

6552
08:09:40,950 --> 08:09:41,990
I don't even know who this is.

6553
08:09:44,680 --> 08:09:45,560
Detective, whatever.

6554
08:09:47,509 --> 08:09:48,229
I don't know who this is.

6555
08:09:54,340 --> 08:09:55,619
I didn't make this lady, did I?

6556
08:09:56,340 --> 08:09:58,169
Oh, it's a caterer.

6557
08:09:58,169 --> 08:10:02,250
I evicted this lady eight, nine hours ago and then I brought them back as a caterer

6558
08:10:02,250 --> 08:10:03,529
and then made them part of the family.

6559
08:10:05,529 --> 08:10:10,500
No one, here's an interesting piece of information here.

6560
08:10:10,500 --> 08:10:12,259
Nobody here is from any original family.

6561
08:10:12,900 --> 08:10:16,259
The gnome was not supposed to be part of any family.

6562
08:10:18,779 --> 08:10:19,500
Everybody's gone.

6563
08:10:20,060 --> 08:10:22,119
The gnome was just the drug dealer.

6564
08:10:30,599 --> 08:10:33,720
Now, thank you for joining me in the nine hour car joke

6565
08:10:35,319 --> 08:10:37,240
with some other random stuff sprinkled in.

6566
08:10:37,959 --> 08:10:39,959
Who the hell is this?

6567
08:10:40,599 --> 08:11:01,659
What the fuck are you doing?

6568
08:11:02,220 --> 08:11:05,290
Is that Peter?

6569
08:11:06,840 --> 08:11:07,479
No, it's not.

6570
08:11:08,119 --> 08:11:14,759
That's not Peter.

6571
08:11:14,759 --> 08:11:17,560
That's some random person that died here like six days ago.

6572
08:11:28,310 --> 08:11:29,430
There's another person here.

6573
08:11:29,430 --> 08:11:29,990
Who's this?

6574
08:11:30,549 --> 08:11:37,610
Who is this person?

6575
08:11:37,610 --> 08:11:59,060
Is he going to drink out of a dirty cup?

6576
08:11:59,540 --> 08:12:05,560
Where are you going?

6577
08:12:07,209 --> 08:12:08,409
Scared by ghost.

6578
08:12:10,060 --> 08:12:12,380
Oh, I thought he was scared by the ghost.

6579
08:12:13,099 --> 08:12:15,380
Oh, I get it.

6580
08:12:15,380 --> 08:12:16,340
They come and they haunt you.

6581
08:12:17,540 --> 08:12:34,419
I'm so confused right now.

6582
08:12:34,419 --> 08:12:41,299
You've not wake up from that.

6583
08:12:41,299 --> 08:12:42,259
It just turned him green.

6584
08:12:43,060 --> 08:12:50,580
Take the soul.

6585
08:12:57,500 --> 08:12:59,099
Age down the ghost.

6586
08:12:59,099 --> 08:13:00,060
Age down the ghost.

6587
08:13:00,060 --> 08:13:01,020
What do you mean age down?

6588
08:13:01,020 --> 08:13:01,979
Age down until what?

6589
08:13:02,540 --> 08:13:07,860
You're about to use the computer?

6590
08:13:12,869 --> 08:13:14,549
What the fuck are you two doing here?

6591
08:13:16,279 --> 08:13:17,639
I have no clue.

6592
08:13:17,639 --> 08:13:20,119
He's picking up the demon evil book.

6593
08:13:25,590 --> 08:13:33,220
Uh, that's okay.

6594
08:13:33,220 --> 08:13:33,939
That's not good.

6595
08:13:34,500 --> 08:13:36,700
That's all he wanted to see.

6596
08:13:36,700 --> 08:13:38,220
He's getting a good he's getting a spell.

6597
08:13:38,220 --> 08:13:39,419
Yeah, how's this for a spell?

6598
08:13:49,500 --> 08:13:50,459
Did it work?

6599
08:13:50,459 --> 08:13:55,669
I don't think I don't think you can do it.

6600
08:14:05,000 --> 08:14:06,520
At least you're cleaning up after yourself.

6601
08:14:06,520 --> 08:14:07,319
That's nice of you.

6602
08:14:12,259 --> 08:14:13,540
I don't think it can work.

6603
08:14:13,540 --> 08:14:16,299
Nah, you can't do it to uh to ghost.

6604
08:14:16,299 --> 08:14:25,509
I don't think all right somebody needs to get up.

6605
08:14:25,509 --> 08:14:29,669
Get up and uh let me try to one last thing.

6606
08:14:29,669 --> 08:14:30,229
Where's the book?

6607
08:14:30,229 --> 08:14:31,029
Where do you put it away?

6608
08:14:32,409 --> 08:14:33,369
Book of Chaos.

6609
08:14:33,369 --> 08:14:34,569
Put it down in the world over here.

6610
08:14:35,290 --> 08:14:38,599
Let's get these evil spirits out of here.

6611
08:14:39,240 --> 08:14:41,619
All right, where'd you put it?

6612
08:14:41,619 --> 08:14:44,840
I'm not in the trash.

6613
08:14:45,639 --> 08:14:47,000
All right, uh, read.

6614
08:14:47,000 --> 08:14:47,400
Put it.

6615
08:14:47,400 --> 08:14:48,520
Ask to be partners in crime.

6616
08:14:48,520 --> 08:14:49,240
Burn Sim.

6617
08:14:49,959 --> 08:14:51,000
Drown Sim in pee.

6618
08:15:00,599 --> 08:15:01,479
Where are they?

6619
08:15:01,479 --> 08:15:15,659
Can I make the ghost streak?

6620
08:15:18,340 --> 08:15:18,819
Who is this?

6621
08:15:32,200 --> 08:15:36,040
Um, naked ghost is more clothes.

6622
08:15:36,840 --> 08:15:43,560
Okay, bye.

6623
08:15:43,560 --> 08:15:49,369
We also have embarrass a sim to death.

6624
08:15:51,479 --> 08:15:52,279
I wanted to drown.

6625
08:16:08,060 --> 08:16:20,900
He's still alive.

6626
08:16:23,270 --> 08:16:23,830
He's still alive.

6627
08:16:24,229 --> 08:16:24,869
He's not dead yet.

6628
08:16:24,869 --> 08:16:26,229
He's not dead and I got it.

6629
08:16:26,229 --> 08:16:26,549
I'm good.

6630
08:16:27,189 --> 08:16:32,470
He's still alive.

6631
08:16:32,470 --> 08:16:33,750
I caught it right at the end.

6632
08:16:33,750 --> 08:16:38,119
I didn't save the game either.

6633
08:16:38,119 --> 08:16:41,400
I saved it before that like 30, 40 minutes ago.

6634
08:16:42,740 --> 08:16:44,020
Show us proof that he's still alive.

6635
08:16:44,020 --> 08:16:44,259
Sure.

6636
08:16:44,900 --> 08:17:09,189
Oh, that was as chaotic as I thought it was going to be.

6637
08:17:19,799 --> 08:17:21,720
That was a perfect opportunity to gnome chat.

6638
08:17:21,720 --> 08:17:23,319
My brain can't think that far.

6639
08:17:23,319 --> 08:17:25,639
It's been eight plus hours of this.

6640
08:17:26,520 --> 08:17:29,799
Just constant just total absolute bullshit.

6641
08:17:34,180 --> 08:17:35,380
Oh my god.

6642
08:17:40,180 --> 08:17:41,060
Thank you all so much.

6643
08:17:41,700 --> 08:17:44,020
That was the part two of The Sims 4.

6644
08:17:46,150 --> 08:17:46,389
Hell.

6645
08:17:47,189 --> 08:17:51,419
I thought that was hilarious.

6646
08:17:52,950 --> 08:17:55,509
Maybe too many car jokes, but you know what happens.

6647
08:17:55,509 --> 08:18:00,549
Can't wait for part three.

6648
08:18:00,549 --> 08:18:01,909
Uh, we'll have to see about that.

6649
08:18:02,630 --> 08:18:05,939
Sorry we went really late.

6650
08:18:05,939 --> 08:18:12,439
I know a lot of people couldn't stick around because it is very, very, very late.

6651
08:18:13,340 --> 08:18:20,340
So I know a lot of you had to leave, but I will see you guys again.

6652
08:18:20,340 --> 08:18:23,060
Uh, I don't know necessarily.

6653
08:18:23,060 --> 08:18:24,659
I might be streaming.

6654
08:18:25,380 --> 08:18:28,900
I'm not streaming tomorrow or today technically for a lot of you guys.

6655
08:18:30,020 --> 08:18:32,020
Because I have a doctor's appointment on Friday.

6656
08:18:32,020 --> 08:18:37,020
So today, uh, Saturday I'm trying to think what's going on.

6657
08:18:37,020 --> 08:18:38,700
I think I have something I have to do on Saturday.

6658
08:18:40,919 --> 08:18:42,279
I know I'm not streaming tomorrow.

6659
08:18:43,080 --> 08:18:45,049
We'll see.

6660
08:18:45,049 --> 08:18:45,689
I'll let you know.

6661
08:18:45,689 --> 08:18:46,330
I'll let you know.

6662
08:18:46,330 --> 08:18:48,650
I'll make a tweet or, uh, I'll be in the discord.

6663
08:18:50,759 --> 08:18:56,200
The next stream I'm going to maybe try to set up the next stream to be the pogo stick

6664
08:18:56,200 --> 08:18:57,400
gamer challenge with Joel.

6665
08:19:02,220 --> 08:19:04,700
So we'll see if I can get that at some point this weekend.

6666
08:19:05,930 --> 08:19:08,650
Yeah, check his schedule.

6667
08:19:16,360 --> 08:19:18,840
Don't accidentally go to the vet instead of the doctor.

6668
08:19:19,799 --> 08:19:30,900
I will try, but that is a long, long stream of The Sims 4.

6669
08:19:32,090 --> 08:19:33,930
That didn't feel like very long to me at all.

6670
08:19:34,810 --> 08:19:38,169
The first three hours of that though, or two hours or so, was making people.

6671
08:19:39,049 --> 08:19:42,119
But I'll get in touch with Joel.

6672
08:19:43,909 --> 08:19:44,950
And let's go to the bits.

6673
08:19:45,830 --> 08:19:49,830
We've got about, uh, not very many, I don't think.

6674
08:19:52,729 --> 08:19:55,689
I don't think there's a whole lot of bits to go through.

6675
08:19:59,590 --> 08:20:00,950
Wait, as in Vinesauce Joel?

6676
08:20:00,950 --> 08:20:05,029
Yeah, we're going to be doing a little co-op stream over the next few days.

6677
08:20:05,750 --> 08:20:06,889
I'll let you know.

6678
08:20:09,689 --> 08:20:14,569
But going all the way back to making Mr. Cassadan for the 250.

6679
08:20:15,290 --> 08:20:18,500
Can we listen to this next time you do Picross?

6680
08:20:20,169 --> 08:20:21,770
Uh, what is it?

6681
08:20:21,770 --> 08:20:22,650
Let's see.

6682
08:20:22,650 --> 08:20:26,919
This is called becoming a gorilla fast.

6683
08:20:31,080 --> 08:20:34,279
Pre-experience subliminal frequency hypnosis.

6684
08:20:34,279 --> 08:20:35,240
I ain't going to listen to that.

6685
08:20:36,119 --> 08:20:38,580
That's like, that's freaking me out.

6686
08:20:39,400 --> 08:20:39,959
Just the name.

6687
08:20:40,759 --> 08:20:47,110
It's like a brown noise.

6688
08:20:49,020 --> 08:20:49,659
But thank you.

6689
08:20:51,020 --> 08:20:58,060
Uh, thank you to Robot Joan for the $2.40, uh, 54 cents.

6690
08:20:58,619 --> 08:21:01,590
Hey, Jeremy, just want to let you know, I want to know how your day is.

6691
08:21:01,590 --> 08:21:03,830
You don't need to ask me as I am a robot boy.

6692
08:21:03,830 --> 08:21:07,029
Also, Garfield, that challenge is happening since my cartoon is better.

6693
08:21:07,990 --> 08:21:09,590
Also, I have a giant bulb head.

6694
08:21:10,389 --> 08:21:15,659
Getting a cartoon throw down here.

6695
08:21:17,029 --> 08:21:17,509
Somehow.

6696
08:21:18,069 --> 08:21:21,430
Thank you, Robot Joan for the $2.50.

6697
08:21:21,990 --> 08:21:22,970
Appreciate it.

6698
08:21:23,610 --> 08:21:27,400
Uh, thank you, Zach, for the $4.

6699
08:21:28,119 --> 08:21:29,479
Did it say show love?

6700
08:21:29,479 --> 08:21:29,880
Thank you.

6701
08:21:31,509 --> 08:21:32,630
Trust no one.

6702
08:21:33,349 --> 08:21:35,159
Thank you, trust no one for the $2.50.

6703
08:21:35,799 --> 08:21:37,380
Hello, Jeremy.

6704
08:21:37,380 --> 08:21:38,740
You are back from the virtual world.

6705
08:21:38,740 --> 08:21:40,180
Your VR experience was something.

6706
08:21:40,740 --> 08:21:43,299
And how nice to see Star and you playing games together again.

6707
08:21:43,299 --> 08:21:47,779
But to get Star back, you had to make him be in robe, wear a mask,

6708
08:21:47,779 --> 08:21:51,380
speak into a voice morpher, watch stream from phone, crawl into window,

6709
08:21:51,380 --> 08:21:52,900
crawl through it during 30 minutes.

6710
08:21:52,900 --> 08:21:53,139
Wow.

6711
08:21:53,139 --> 08:21:53,619
Anytime.

6712
08:21:54,180 --> 08:21:55,060
It's movie time.

6713
08:21:55,779 --> 08:21:58,500
Last time you, Mark and Will tried your best at dad jokes.

6714
08:21:58,500 --> 08:21:59,220
Those were not good.

6715
08:21:59,220 --> 08:22:00,979
No, it's just playground insults.

6716
08:22:05,159 --> 08:22:06,919
Did you see the money that was in that draw?

6717
08:22:11,139 --> 08:22:16,040
We got a, uh, Jeremy Elberton and Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg insult each other.

6718
08:22:16,599 --> 08:22:18,419
Let's get it on the screen.

6719
08:22:18,419 --> 08:22:19,060
Let's take a look.

6720
08:22:33,099 --> 08:22:33,740
Previously.

6721
08:22:34,380 --> 08:22:35,180
Lazy boy.

6722
08:22:39,990 --> 08:22:42,869
Dad, this is the, uh, I watched the one before this.

6723
08:22:44,470 --> 08:22:45,270
This is another one.

6724
08:22:45,270 --> 08:22:48,869
We're with Germer and Mark Wahlberg about to play the playground insults game.

6725
08:22:50,680 --> 08:22:51,639
It's good to see you again.

6726
08:22:52,279 --> 08:22:54,340
You look like a made in a paper.

6727
08:22:56,259 --> 08:22:59,220
You could call me a fucking dumb dickhead McGee and I wouldn't even care.

6728
08:22:59,779 --> 08:23:00,340
I mean, I would.

6729
08:23:00,340 --> 08:23:02,580
It might, it might hurt my feelings a little bit, but don't do that.

6730
08:23:02,580 --> 08:23:03,060
It would be mean.

6731
08:23:04,180 --> 08:23:05,459
You're not a nice person.

6732
08:23:06,099 --> 08:23:06,979
Easy now.

6733
08:23:06,979 --> 08:23:07,479
Easy.

6734
08:23:08,580 --> 08:23:10,020
This guy sucks.

6735
08:23:10,020 --> 08:23:12,340
Like this guy sucks.

6736
08:23:12,340 --> 08:23:14,099
Like what a fucking loser.

6737
08:23:16,180 --> 08:23:19,380
Your hair looks like a brilipad that I want to scrub my sack with.

6738
08:23:22,979 --> 08:23:24,259
Why the fuck?

6739
08:23:24,819 --> 08:23:26,020
I thought he was going to jump on me.

6740
08:23:27,189 --> 08:23:28,950
Your hair is like baby hair.

6741
08:23:29,990 --> 08:23:32,709
You're a wonderfully looking human being.

6742
08:23:33,270 --> 08:23:34,069
What are you doing?

6743
08:23:34,069 --> 08:23:35,189
He's being sarcastic.

6744
08:23:35,189 --> 08:23:37,270
Oh, fucking swell boy.

6745
08:23:37,830 --> 08:23:39,590
Your feet smell like weed.

6746
08:23:40,549 --> 08:23:41,029
What?

6747
08:23:41,029 --> 08:23:42,310
When did I ever say that?

6748
08:23:44,069 --> 08:23:45,189
That's very kind of you, dude.

6749
08:23:45,909 --> 08:23:47,029
You know, just fuck it.

6750
08:23:47,029 --> 08:23:48,229
You are fucking tiny.

6751
08:23:48,950 --> 08:23:50,389
That doesn't sound very original.

6752
08:23:51,110 --> 08:23:52,630
Were you popular in high school?

6753
08:23:54,279 --> 08:23:54,520
No.

6754
08:23:55,479 --> 08:23:57,560
Remember I told you you could make me say anything you want.

6755
08:23:58,840 --> 08:24:01,619
I will.

6756
08:24:01,619 --> 08:24:02,099
Get ready.

6757
08:24:04,389 --> 08:24:05,750
You smell like baby barf.

6758
08:24:08,259 --> 08:24:08,759
You'll see.

6759
08:24:09,799 --> 08:24:10,299
You'll see.

6760
08:24:11,000 --> 08:24:11,959
You look 90.

6761
08:24:13,779 --> 08:24:17,369
Your mama raised you well.

6762
08:24:19,240 --> 08:24:21,000
You look like a James Bond villain.

6763
08:24:22,150 --> 08:24:27,610
You wish you could scrub your sack with my brillo head if you had a sack.

6764
08:24:28,889 --> 08:24:30,090
You sackless bitch.

6765
08:24:31,130 --> 08:24:32,810
If you think that aliens don't exist.

6766
08:24:33,369 --> 08:24:35,049
Oh boy, I've got some news for you.

6767
08:24:36,090 --> 08:24:40,009
In your movies, I can see you and your coverage

6768
08:24:40,009 --> 08:24:43,130
mouthing the line of the other actor silently to yourself.

6769
08:24:44,659 --> 08:24:45,540
Don't say such a thing.

6770
08:24:45,540 --> 08:24:46,500
It makes me feel bad.

6771
08:24:47,060 --> 08:24:47,860
I'm an actor.

6772
08:24:47,860 --> 08:24:48,340
You know what I mean?

6773
08:24:48,340 --> 08:24:49,299
I'm a fucking actor.

6774
08:24:50,340 --> 08:24:51,939
You're a terrible actor.

6775
08:24:53,299 --> 08:24:54,419
Like, oh great, okay.

6776
08:24:54,979 --> 08:24:56,180
Fuck, you know that, you know that like

6777
08:24:56,180 --> 08:24:58,500
fucked up looking freak show character, the Joker?

6778
08:24:59,540 --> 08:25:01,619
You look like the Joker without makeup on.

6779
08:25:02,580 --> 08:25:10,220
You got a great ass for a guy from Boston.

6780
08:25:15,770 --> 08:25:16,409
Next time.

6781
08:25:16,409 --> 08:25:16,729
Let's see.

6782
08:25:16,729 --> 08:25:17,130
What is it?

6783
08:25:17,130 --> 08:25:17,849
Let's see.

6784
08:25:17,849 --> 08:25:20,650
Hollywood's nobody's shutting down reporters.

6785
08:25:21,450 --> 08:25:22,409
Coming up next.

6786
08:25:23,049 --> 08:25:27,259
Good luck.

6787
08:25:27,259 --> 08:25:29,639
This is never going to end, is it?

6788
08:25:34,500 --> 08:25:35,619
Shutting down reporters.

6789
08:25:38,939 --> 08:25:40,380
Yeah, I told you guys this before though.

6790
08:25:40,380 --> 08:25:44,540
I've said 85% of every word in the human dictionary.

6791
08:25:45,340 --> 08:25:48,919
You talk about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

6792
08:25:48,919 --> 08:25:51,240
and maybe even potentially thousands of hours on stream

6793
08:25:53,159 --> 08:25:56,779
and eight, nine, a hundred videos.

6794
08:25:57,580 --> 08:25:58,939
I've said almost every word.

6795
08:26:02,500 --> 08:26:07,930
Like at least 82% of every word.

6796
08:26:07,930 --> 08:26:08,729
Humble brag.

6797
08:26:12,279 --> 08:26:13,240
Shut up.

6798
08:26:13,240 --> 08:26:16,520
But thank you Trust No One for that video.

6799
08:26:17,380 --> 08:26:18,259
It was great.

6800
08:26:18,259 --> 08:26:18,659
Thank you.

6801
08:26:20,970 --> 08:26:22,569
Hey Divus, thanks for the 250, Divus.

6802
08:26:23,700 --> 08:26:25,700
Beware, I live thanks to the 250.

6803
08:26:25,700 --> 08:26:27,939
Hey Jerry, I was just speeding around in my neighborhood

6804
08:26:27,939 --> 08:26:30,340
outside of Vegas but now I gotta rush home to catch your stream.

6805
08:26:31,220 --> 08:26:31,720
Vroom.

6806
08:26:32,180 --> 08:26:33,290
Oh, I didn't give a link.

6807
08:26:33,290 --> 08:26:34,409
What am I, stupid?

6808
08:26:34,409 --> 08:26:35,130
Here.

6809
08:26:35,130 --> 08:26:36,569
Yeah, I am pretty dumb, aren't I?

6810
08:26:36,569 --> 08:26:38,169
Yeah, VR Josh got it.

6811
08:26:39,419 --> 08:26:40,380
That's the link right there.

6812
08:26:43,509 --> 08:26:44,790
Thank you, VR Josh.

6813
08:26:44,790 --> 08:26:49,720
Yeah, I'll do it again.

6814
08:26:49,720 --> 08:26:50,759
Yeah, watch this.

6815
08:26:51,400 --> 08:26:52,520
Now you got a double link.

6816
08:26:55,900 --> 08:26:57,740
Uh, but thank you, beware, I live.

6817
08:26:58,540 --> 08:26:59,500
Thanks for driving around.

6818
08:27:00,139 --> 08:27:01,909
Mostly lost, thanks for the 250.

6819
08:27:01,909 --> 08:27:04,630
I've said this before but if your stream is nothing but character creation streams,

6820
08:27:04,630 --> 08:27:05,509
I'd still enjoy it.

6821
08:27:06,150 --> 08:27:08,279
I'm already in tears, thank you for this.

6822
08:27:09,080 --> 08:27:10,040
I think that's half the fun.

6823
08:27:10,840 --> 08:27:15,560
For me, half the fun is not even getting in the game and having them do crazy shit.

6824
08:27:16,200 --> 08:27:19,770
It's making them in the first place.

6825
08:27:19,770 --> 08:27:22,330
That's why I spend more than two or three hours just dicking around,

6826
08:27:22,330 --> 08:27:24,409
having fun, making like two or three different families.

6827
08:27:25,610 --> 08:27:35,299
This is just one of those streams where it just happens in front of your face,

6828
08:27:35,299 --> 08:27:35,799
you know what I mean?

6829
08:27:36,919 --> 08:27:42,840
Sometimes, oh look, I wonder what, I wonder maybe I could come up with something funny.

6830
08:27:42,840 --> 08:27:46,040
No, this should, whatever, I'm in the seat here watching it with you guys.

6831
08:27:52,319 --> 08:27:55,119
Just whatever they decide to do and how whatever it happens.

6832
08:27:55,840 --> 08:28:01,689
But thank you, mostly lost, it means a lot.

6833
08:28:02,250 --> 08:28:06,479
And again, mostly lost another 250.

6834
08:28:07,119 --> 08:28:11,290
I love how you made Barry both self-assured and gloomy.

6835
08:28:23,799 --> 08:28:26,360
Sometimes he just picked randomly, you know?

6836
08:28:26,360 --> 08:28:30,119
There were five story arcs where the best story arc was absolutely the genie.

6837
08:28:33,000 --> 08:28:37,720
I don't know, the cat running away was pretty ridiculous.

6838
08:28:38,439 --> 08:28:41,630
I think the entire arc of the genie was the best though.

6839
08:28:41,630 --> 08:28:43,150
From start to finish, that was the longest one.

6840
08:28:43,150 --> 08:28:45,069
That took about like almost four hours of time.

6841
08:28:46,270 --> 08:28:50,680
Going on a date with a banana, the genie being in the game to begin with.

6842
08:28:52,669 --> 08:28:54,509
The two gangs, I forgot about that.

6843
08:28:54,509 --> 08:28:56,990
So much happened, it's just too much to even think about.

6844
08:28:58,029 --> 08:29:02,639
And there had to be a car in every one of them.

6845
08:29:05,400 --> 08:29:09,200
I like mod abused that car joke.

6846
08:29:10,729 --> 08:29:13,369
It was just, it's just so out of control.

6847
08:29:13,369 --> 08:29:16,009
It's the most brutal, it's so fast.

6848
08:29:20,889 --> 08:29:22,970
It hit the crib with the car, it was close.

6849
08:29:23,689 --> 08:29:34,919
It's just the abruptness of the car, yeah.

6850
08:29:35,720 --> 08:29:45,069
But thank you, appreciate it.

6851
08:29:49,819 --> 08:29:53,500
Thank you Commando Nam for the five, six, seven, eight dollars here.

6852
08:29:56,650 --> 08:29:58,330
More than that, 18 dollars actually.

6853
08:30:00,959 --> 08:30:01,680
Thank you so much.

6854
08:30:04,360 --> 08:30:05,959
Failing my classes can cheer me up.

6855
08:30:07,799 --> 08:30:10,680
Failing your classes, well, here's what I'll tell you.

6856
08:30:12,270 --> 08:30:19,150
Uh, try to spend a little more time focusing on schoolwork.

6857
08:30:20,220 --> 08:30:21,659
I know it can be a huge pain.

6858
08:30:25,439 --> 08:30:28,860
Unfortunately, you know, you just got to get it done.

6859
08:30:30,720 --> 08:30:31,599
That's just the way it is.

6860
08:30:31,599 --> 08:30:33,520
I had problems in school when I was in high school.

6861
08:30:34,240 --> 08:30:37,209
But you just got to get it done, you just got to do it.

6862
08:30:38,009 --> 08:30:42,880
Can't focus on school with eight hour Sims 4 streams.

6863
08:30:44,619 --> 08:30:45,580
You just got to do your best.

6864
08:30:45,580 --> 08:30:52,000
Do your best and maybe, maybe disconnect a little bit from the computer.

6865
08:30:52,639 --> 08:30:54,880
You know, you saw me throw away the computer in the trash.

6866
08:30:55,599 --> 08:31:03,310
Put some music on, relax.

6867
08:31:05,599 --> 08:31:09,599
Grab like a tea or something and just focus on doing some work.

6868
08:31:10,240 --> 08:31:15,520
That's what I used to have to do.

6869
08:31:21,400 --> 08:31:22,680
I work at a computer.

6870
08:31:22,680 --> 08:31:25,639
Well, if you, but I mean, that's true, I forgot.

6871
08:31:25,639 --> 08:31:27,159
Like I used to like use like paper.

6872
08:31:27,959 --> 08:31:29,240
Everybody needs a computer now.

6873
08:31:29,880 --> 08:31:31,000
Shit, this advice is bad.

6874
08:31:35,689 --> 08:31:37,689
Hey, throw your computer in the trash.

6875
08:31:39,310 --> 08:31:41,389
You know, the thing that you probably need

6876
08:31:41,389 --> 08:31:48,970
to do your assignment on, you just got to do your best.

6877
08:31:48,970 --> 08:31:53,869
Do your best and just focus whenever you can get the opportunity to.

6878
08:31:53,869 --> 08:31:55,229
It's really the best advice I can give.

6879
08:31:57,549 --> 08:31:58,830
Everybody's a little different though.

6880
08:32:00,720 --> 08:32:01,119
Good luck.

6881
08:32:05,000 --> 08:32:06,439
Mostly lost, thanks to the 250.

6882
08:32:06,439 --> 08:32:09,319
I'm now fully convinced the Vroomer is a stream sniper.

6883
08:32:10,459 --> 08:32:10,860
Me too.

6884
08:32:11,500 --> 08:32:17,479
Freudian weapon, thanks to the 250.

6885
08:32:18,750 --> 08:32:19,389
Happy Thursday.

6886
08:32:19,389 --> 08:32:20,509
Happy Thursday to you as well.

6887
08:32:20,509 --> 08:32:21,310
Well, now it's Friday.

6888
08:32:25,020 --> 08:32:25,659
Now it's Friday.

6889
08:32:30,279 --> 08:32:33,479
Commando Nam, thanks again for the 550 here.

6890
08:32:35,849 --> 08:32:37,770
One of my assignments is biology.

6891
08:32:37,770 --> 08:32:38,970
Can you help in biology?

6892
08:32:41,599 --> 08:32:43,840
I don't, I don't think, I didn't even take biology.

6893
08:32:44,479 --> 08:32:46,200
I have no idea.

6894
08:32:46,840 --> 08:32:49,099
I can't help you.

6895
08:32:49,099 --> 08:32:56,060
Only knows that biology has frogs and fish and organisms.

6896
08:32:56,060 --> 08:32:58,830
And I didn't really learn that much biology.

6897
08:32:59,389 --> 08:33:01,790
I think we didn't spend very much time on it in science class.

6898
08:33:01,790 --> 08:33:05,159
We spent maybe two weeks on it.

6899
08:33:05,720 --> 08:33:07,159
I might be completely wrong.

6900
08:33:07,880 --> 08:33:11,000
I haven't been in high school in like 20 years.

6901
08:33:11,560 --> 08:33:12,599
It's been a long time.

6902
08:33:12,599 --> 08:33:13,240
I don't remember.

6903
08:33:13,240 --> 08:33:13,959
I can't even tell you.

6904
08:33:14,759 --> 08:33:20,409
I have no idea.

6905
08:33:21,130 --> 08:33:27,659
Have a good night, class.

6906
08:33:28,540 --> 08:33:29,500
See you again.

6907
08:33:29,500 --> 08:33:30,299
Yeah, it's a late one.

6908
08:33:31,259 --> 08:33:35,840
Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.

6909
08:33:35,840 --> 08:33:38,159
Hey Jeremy, just want to say that these kinds of streams are my favorite.

6910
08:33:38,720 --> 08:33:41,200
But I'm going to miss most of it because I'm going to go see a movie.

6911
08:33:41,759 --> 08:33:42,720
Anyways, hope you have fun.

6912
08:33:42,720 --> 08:33:45,840
And I can't wait to watch the VOD and 90% of it is just character creation.

6913
08:33:46,400 --> 08:33:47,759
And have a good night, Jerma, and chat.

6914
08:33:49,770 --> 08:33:50,490
Close, close.

6915
08:33:50,490 --> 08:33:51,369
Thank you, Peaceful Haley.

6916
08:33:52,520 --> 08:33:53,159
Not quite though.

6917
08:33:53,799 --> 08:33:57,659
We got eight hours and 35 minutes.

6918
08:33:57,659 --> 08:33:59,419
The first two hours and 30 minutes.

6919
08:33:59,419 --> 08:34:03,020
So it was about 30, 35% or so.

6920
08:34:05,400 --> 08:34:06,279
Just short of 90.

6921
08:34:06,840 --> 08:34:08,509
But I appreciate it.

6922
08:34:09,720 --> 08:34:10,759
I love these streams too.

6923
08:34:11,400 --> 08:34:14,919
I love just watching.

6924
08:34:14,919 --> 08:34:15,159
You know what?

6925
08:34:15,159 --> 08:34:19,959
One of my favorite things in the world is watching AI be AI.

6926
08:34:21,310 --> 08:34:24,889
And watching people who are math problems

6927
08:34:25,770 --> 08:34:29,610
come up with ways to do their internal math problem.

6928
08:34:36,669 --> 08:34:37,389
It's just fun.

6929
08:34:42,000 --> 08:34:43,759
Because you never know what they could possibly do.

6930
08:34:43,759 --> 08:34:45,040
Sure, I'm like the orchestra.

6931
08:34:45,040 --> 08:34:51,439
I've got the, who's the guy that runs the concert?

6932
08:34:51,439 --> 08:34:53,340
What's his name?

6933
08:34:53,340 --> 08:34:54,540
He's the guy with the little stick in his hand.

6934
08:34:54,540 --> 08:34:56,060
He's got the magic wand in his hand.

6935
08:34:56,060 --> 08:34:57,580
The guy, he's like a magician, but he's naughty.

6936
08:34:57,580 --> 08:34:58,459
Like a conductor.

6937
08:35:00,520 --> 08:35:03,880
I might be the conductor, but all the instruments are not run by me.

6938
08:35:03,880 --> 08:35:05,080
It's just fun to watch them play.

6939
08:35:08,520 --> 08:35:09,080
But thank you though.

6940
08:35:09,080 --> 08:35:10,520
Thank you Super Seal for the 250.

6941
08:35:10,520 --> 08:35:14,840
Can you enable the vroom B-T-T-V emote?

6942
08:35:15,479 --> 08:35:24,650
I might have to at this rate.

6943
08:35:24,650 --> 08:35:26,009
It's all you guys here.

6944
08:35:26,729 --> 08:35:30,330
I only have five slots though.

6945
08:35:30,330 --> 08:35:31,290
I'm going to delete something.

6946
08:35:34,270 --> 08:35:35,310
What's going to get the X?

6947
08:35:35,310 --> 08:35:35,709
I wonder.

6948
08:35:36,349 --> 08:35:39,240
Hey Space Cat.

6949
08:35:40,040 --> 08:35:41,400
Thank you Space Cat for the five bucks.

6950
08:35:41,400 --> 08:35:43,000
You make the most attractive sims.

6951
08:35:43,560 --> 08:35:46,939
I think that they're all beautiful.

6952
08:35:47,580 --> 08:35:53,880
Thank you Mostly Lost for the 250.

6953
08:35:53,880 --> 08:35:57,240
Let it be known that Elephant Feet is now permanently in your Google search history.

6954
08:35:59,900 --> 08:36:10,439
Uh, so I googled something way worse.

6955
08:36:11,240 --> 08:36:12,599
Like an hour after that.

6956
08:36:19,159 --> 08:36:23,799
I think I typed in like how to make a pregnancy happen in Sims or something.

6957
08:36:23,799 --> 08:36:24,360
Whatever it was.

6958
08:36:25,080 --> 08:36:30,830
It was like how do I force a baby out in Sims 4?

6959
08:36:30,830 --> 08:36:33,229
I've tried trying to like because somebody said you can like just click it.

6960
08:36:34,119 --> 08:36:35,000
It was something like that.

6961
08:36:35,720 --> 08:36:45,000
Yeah, that's way fucking worse than Elephant Feet.

6962
08:36:56,650 --> 08:36:57,209
But thank you.

6963
08:36:57,849 --> 08:37:02,250
We also had uh, Mostly Lost again 250.

6964
08:37:02,250 --> 08:37:04,810
Eight lives is basically the cat from this video.

6965
08:37:05,369 --> 08:37:07,209
Oh, I hope this ain't a cat.

6966
08:37:07,209 --> 08:37:08,330
Something happening to a cat.

6967
08:37:10,669 --> 08:37:12,590
Oh, I have seen this before.

6968
08:37:13,310 --> 08:37:17,069
This is uh, hey Michael Rappaport.

6969
08:37:17,069 --> 08:37:19,549
Hey, don't fucking look at me like that.

6970
08:37:19,549 --> 08:37:21,549
That's a weird looking fucking cat.

6971
08:37:22,750 --> 08:37:23,709
I've seen this video.

6972
08:37:31,279 --> 08:37:32,799
That is a classic video.

6973
08:37:33,439 --> 08:37:38,880
But thank you Mostly Lost again for your 250 again.

6974
08:37:39,900 --> 08:37:41,500
Robot Jones, thanks for the free bucks again.

6975
08:37:41,500 --> 08:37:41,979
Hey, I'm back.

6976
08:37:41,979 --> 08:37:45,580
I wanted to see what your channel looked like back in 2011.

6977
08:37:45,580 --> 08:37:49,259
So I used the Wayback Machine installed in my brain and I found this amazing.

6978
08:37:49,259 --> 08:37:49,979
Jerma Channel.

6979
08:37:53,020 --> 08:37:57,439
Uh, it started, it started in 2011.

6980
08:37:58,080 --> 08:38:00,560
It was in 10 maybe.

6981
08:38:01,279 --> 08:38:07,450
I was on other channels too.

6982
08:38:08,779 --> 08:38:13,479
They were like, I'm trying to think of like other,

6983
08:38:13,479 --> 08:38:17,240
there was other projects that I did on other people's channels long fucking time ago.

6984
08:38:19,520 --> 08:38:20,639
They don't like exist anymore.

6985
08:38:20,639 --> 08:38:22,240
I'm talking long, long time ago.

6986
08:38:22,880 --> 08:38:32,919
When I think about how long I've been on the internet for,

6987
08:38:38,909 --> 08:38:43,549
just, oh, I like, I'm going to make videos or like go back to Newgrounds.

6988
08:38:44,270 --> 08:38:50,860
Talking like 2004, 2003, 2004.

6989
08:38:51,500 --> 08:38:57,880
That's a long goddamn time ago.

6990
08:38:58,439 --> 08:39:02,090
Now, how do you think I know Bloerdal?

6991
08:39:07,580 --> 08:39:13,040
Me and Bloerdal met on Newgrounds like 14 years ago, something like that 15 years ago.

6992
08:39:19,150 --> 08:39:20,270
Might even be longer than that.

6993
08:39:37,470 --> 08:39:38,909
Newgrounds are old.

6994
08:39:38,909 --> 08:39:40,029
What happened to Newgrounds?

6995
08:39:40,830 --> 08:39:47,049
Is it still there?

6996
08:39:47,369 --> 08:39:48,250
Is it still working?

6997
08:39:55,819 --> 08:39:58,220
Is it still owned by the folks?

6998
08:39:58,220 --> 08:39:59,979
Does Tom Fulps still own that website?

6999
08:40:04,639 --> 08:40:07,599
Yeah, well, talking about someone who's been around for a long time.

7000
08:40:10,729 --> 08:40:12,250
That's a very long time ago.

7001
08:40:14,590 --> 08:40:23,630
But thank you for the trip down memory lane, RobotJones.

7002
08:40:24,939 --> 08:40:25,979
Appreciate it.

7003
08:40:25,979 --> 08:40:34,330
Tumblr banned porn so they migrated there.

7004
08:40:35,130 --> 08:40:42,060
That's a very long time ago.

7005
08:40:42,060 --> 08:40:44,220
Well, not that, but Newgrounds in general.

7006
08:40:52,490 --> 08:40:53,209
Sleep tight.

7007
08:40:55,880 --> 08:40:56,919
Uh, what else we got here?

7008
08:40:56,919 --> 08:40:59,560
We have, uh, Tingy.

7009
08:40:59,560 --> 08:41:00,439
Thanks for the 250.

7010
08:41:01,000 --> 08:41:01,720
Nice twerking.

7011
08:41:01,720 --> 08:41:02,439
Take some money.

7012
08:41:03,240 --> 08:41:11,759
Forgot what happened five hours ago.

7013
08:41:11,759 --> 08:41:12,080
Thank you.

7014
08:41:12,080 --> 08:41:13,200
Mostly lost for the 250.

7015
08:41:13,200 --> 08:41:15,200
What's your price for twerking on stream?

7016
08:41:15,759 --> 08:41:16,080
Zero.

7017
08:41:17,400 --> 08:41:18,680
Zero, zero, zero, zero.

7018
08:41:25,000 --> 08:41:26,040
Free twerking.

7019
08:41:30,729 --> 08:41:33,849
It's like hitting me like a ton of bricks right now that I'm just exhausted.

7020
08:41:39,310 --> 08:41:41,549
I'm coming down right now after that.

7021
08:41:50,729 --> 08:41:53,209
Pass the old man's bedtime.

7022
08:41:53,290 --> 08:41:54,009
Something like that.

7023
08:41:57,080 --> 08:42:01,880
Hey, where are we?

7024
08:42:01,880 --> 08:42:03,159
Future gamer, thanks for the 250.

7025
08:42:03,159 --> 08:42:06,680
There's a new VR RPG called Shadow Legend with voice recognition.

7026
08:42:08,090 --> 08:42:09,369
That came out today.

7027
08:42:09,369 --> 08:42:13,209
On a separate note, I have 18 rooms clipped and timed.

7028
08:42:16,200 --> 08:42:17,319
Shadow Legend.

7029
08:42:17,319 --> 08:42:19,229
I'm gonna have to look this up right now.

7030
08:42:19,229 --> 08:42:20,029
Shadow Legend.

7031
08:42:26,919 --> 08:42:30,360
RPG exclusive VR where you play as the grandmaster of the Knights Templar

7032
08:42:30,360 --> 08:42:31,720
in a story-driven medieval crusade.

7033
08:42:31,720 --> 08:42:33,799
Freely explore densely filled worlds.

7034
08:42:34,520 --> 08:42:37,959
And use your sword, bow, and magic to save the kingdom from destruction of Lord

7035
08:42:38,840 --> 08:42:39,479
Adaroth.

7036
08:42:40,439 --> 08:42:43,080
It's voice controlled?

7037
08:42:47,849 --> 08:42:48,889
I might have to play this.

7038
08:42:49,770 --> 08:42:50,729
This looks pretty good.

7039
08:42:51,900 --> 08:42:53,180
You can feed horses carrots.

7040
08:42:55,130 --> 08:42:56,250
All right, add that to the list.

7041
08:43:02,669 --> 08:43:03,470
Thank you, Future Gamer.

7042
08:43:03,470 --> 08:43:04,750
Thank you something or other for the 250.

7043
08:43:04,750 --> 08:43:06,909
Hey, German, it's me from the Applebee's.

7044
08:43:06,909 --> 08:43:09,790
Just want to say thank you again for taking the time to come over and say hi to us.

7045
08:43:10,750 --> 08:43:11,790
It was really cool to meet you.

7046
08:43:12,430 --> 08:43:14,909
As you might remember, it was my grandfather's 80th birthday.

7047
08:43:14,909 --> 08:43:18,990
And while your grandmother's 80th birthday and while her mind is slipping

7048
08:43:18,990 --> 08:43:20,270
and she doesn't know what twitch is,

7049
08:43:20,990 --> 08:43:24,029
she loves meeting new people and thought you were a charming fellow.

7050
08:43:24,029 --> 08:43:25,549
She had fun and I'm really grateful.

7051
08:43:25,549 --> 08:43:26,990
Just one quick question.

7052
08:43:26,990 --> 08:43:31,869
Why did you spit in my food and slip my grandmother your cell phone number?

7053
08:43:35,290 --> 08:43:37,900
Well, one, you were rude.

7054
08:43:37,900 --> 08:43:39,180
Two, she asked for it.

7055
08:43:39,180 --> 08:43:42,299
She like wanted me to give her my number.

7056
08:43:42,299 --> 08:43:43,659
She like asked me for the number.

7057
08:43:44,380 --> 08:43:47,950
What you don't tell the story that you're not telling is

7058
08:43:47,950 --> 08:43:52,970
you came and spit in my food first, three or four different times.

7059
08:43:54,970 --> 08:43:56,250
I didn't even know who you were.

7060
08:43:57,759 --> 08:44:02,159
You said, German, you screaming in my ear.

7061
08:44:02,159 --> 08:44:03,439
I'm at dinner with my girlfriend.

7062
08:44:06,810 --> 08:44:10,330
And then you did, you mashed up a bunch of Skittles in your mouth.

7063
08:44:10,970 --> 08:44:13,360
I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing with this problem?

7064
08:44:14,159 --> 08:44:18,319
You swallowed and you did like the big daddy Adam Sandler movie spit.

7065
08:44:18,959 --> 08:44:24,319
But you dropped a huge, huge Skittle spit right onto my hamburger.

7066
08:44:24,959 --> 08:44:28,569
They said they were going to call the police,

7067
08:44:29,770 --> 08:44:31,049
which I don't know if they did or not.

7068
08:44:31,049 --> 08:44:31,930
You got out of there quick.

7069
08:44:32,729 --> 08:44:36,729
I walked over to your food and spit in yours.

7070
08:44:36,729 --> 08:44:37,849
I don't have any Skittles though.

7071
08:44:38,569 --> 08:44:44,009
Your grandmother simply said, by the way, what's your phone number?

7072
08:44:44,569 --> 08:44:51,770
So I can get in touch with you to repay you for the meal that my obnoxious grandson

7073
08:44:51,770 --> 08:44:52,330
just ruined.

7074
08:44:54,430 --> 08:44:58,029
So yeah, I gave my phone number to your grandmother.

7075
08:44:58,029 --> 08:45:02,189
The whole story, guys.

7076
08:45:02,189 --> 08:45:04,110
That's what happens when you don't get it.

7077
08:45:04,110 --> 08:45:04,669
Unbelievable.

7078
08:45:11,290 --> 08:45:12,090
I was there.

7079
08:45:13,369 --> 08:45:16,639
I saw it.

7080
08:45:16,639 --> 08:45:24,459
Is that what it takes?

7081
08:45:25,180 --> 08:45:31,259
Now, thank you something rather for the 250 and happy 80th birthday to your grandma.

7082
08:45:31,819 --> 08:45:36,439
I am now fully, mostly moistened thanks to the 250.

7083
08:45:36,439 --> 08:45:38,360
For anyone that may have doubted that German is a good man,

7084
08:45:38,360 --> 08:45:42,919
I'll have you know that when he saw an old man beat up his pregnant genie girlfriend,

7085
08:45:42,919 --> 08:45:45,159
he immediately ran him over with a car

7086
08:45:45,159 --> 08:45:47,880
and made sure that the genie had a place to stay.

7087
08:45:47,880 --> 08:45:49,000
What more proof do you need?

7088
08:45:49,799 --> 08:45:52,240
What the hell is going on there?

7089
08:45:59,200 --> 08:46:02,959
Lone MGR, thanks for the five dollars.

7090
08:46:02,959 --> 08:46:04,319
First time donating to a streamer.

7091
08:46:04,319 --> 08:46:04,959
Love your content.

7092
08:46:04,959 --> 08:46:05,680
Sorry, it ain't much.

7093
08:46:06,240 --> 08:46:07,040
German nose wipe.

7094
08:46:07,040 --> 08:46:07,439
Don't worry.

7095
08:46:07,439 --> 08:46:09,119
Don't apologize for giving me money.

7096
08:46:12,619 --> 08:46:14,540
Thanks for even considering.

7097
08:46:18,439 --> 08:46:18,759
Thank you.

7098
08:46:19,400 --> 08:46:22,830
I really appreciate it.

7099
08:46:28,759 --> 08:46:29,080
Thank you.

7100
08:46:29,080 --> 08:46:29,400
Thank you.

7101
08:46:29,400 --> 08:46:29,720
Thank you.

7102
08:46:32,009 --> 08:46:33,930
Do not say sorry.

7103
08:46:38,220 --> 08:46:39,259
Sorry for the cash.

7104
08:46:42,459 --> 08:46:42,939
Peter.

7105
08:46:42,939 --> 08:46:43,979
Welcome back, Peter.

7106
08:46:43,979 --> 08:46:46,139
P337R, thanks for the 20 bucks, Peter.

7107
08:46:46,860 --> 08:46:49,099
Congrats on the baby.

7108
08:46:49,099 --> 08:46:49,900
Thank you.

7109
08:46:49,900 --> 08:46:53,240
Congrats on the baby.

7110
08:46:54,840 --> 08:46:56,279
Thank you for the $20 bill.

7111
08:46:56,919 --> 08:46:57,799
2,000 bits.

7112
08:46:58,599 --> 08:47:00,459
Thank you, Peter.

7113
08:47:01,020 --> 08:47:06,590
Good to see you.

7114
08:47:06,590 --> 08:47:07,229
The thrill.

7115
08:47:07,229 --> 08:47:08,110
Thanks for the five dollars.

7116
08:47:08,110 --> 08:47:08,430
The thrill.

7117
08:47:08,430 --> 08:47:10,669
German, I'm sorry I called you a dick bag last night.

7118
08:47:10,669 --> 08:47:12,830
It was a big boy word I learned at work recently.

7119
08:47:13,470 --> 08:47:16,189
I was tired and half asleep when I slung that at you.

7120
08:47:16,189 --> 08:47:18,990
In my defense, things were getting heated in regards to the concepts

7121
08:47:18,990 --> 08:47:20,270
and definitions of cheating.

7122
08:47:20,830 --> 08:47:22,110
Thanks for tonight's fun.

7123
08:47:22,110 --> 08:47:25,069
PS, whatever happened to exoskeleton bug millennium boy?

7124
08:47:25,950 --> 08:47:29,340
It's funny you mentioned exoskeleton bug millennium boy

7125
08:47:29,340 --> 08:47:32,639
because I will be seeing him very soon.

7126
08:47:33,360 --> 08:47:37,959
Still a friend?

7127
08:47:37,959 --> 08:47:39,000
Still kicking around?

7128
08:47:41,520 --> 08:47:42,720
On the next stream, no.

7129
08:47:49,639 --> 08:47:52,200
A lot of the people and a lot of the friends that I have

7130
08:47:53,659 --> 08:47:56,619
from, you know, before even I turned on a YouTube video.

7131
08:47:57,500 --> 08:48:00,060
No, there's still none.

7132
08:48:00,060 --> 08:48:00,939
I still talk to them.

7133
08:48:00,939 --> 08:48:02,299
I still hang out with them.

7134
08:48:02,299 --> 08:48:05,400
We still converse.

7135
08:48:06,200 --> 08:48:10,700
When is Minecraft VR on the next VR stream?

7136
08:48:10,700 --> 08:48:11,979
Which will be probably next week.

7137
08:48:12,779 --> 08:48:15,259
I will get that set up.

7138
08:48:15,819 --> 08:48:18,119
We'll do another like three or four games

7139
08:48:18,119 --> 08:48:21,159
and then during that VR session I want to also do mine show.

7140
08:48:21,880 --> 08:48:23,080
So we'll get that started too.

7141
08:48:23,959 --> 08:48:26,830
Just want to take a break from VR.

7142
08:48:27,709 --> 08:48:30,830
Can't just go pedal on the ground.

7143
08:48:32,029 --> 08:48:34,880
You just did it today and it's awesome.

7144
08:48:34,880 --> 08:48:35,919
I'm looking forward to it.

7145
08:48:35,919 --> 08:48:37,040
I played for at least an hour.

7146
08:48:37,919 --> 08:48:40,189
But thank you, the thrill.

7147
08:48:41,150 --> 08:48:42,029
Don't worry.

7148
08:48:42,029 --> 08:48:43,790
I know you guys are just fucking around.

7149
08:48:46,040 --> 08:48:47,560
I say a lot of dumb shit too.

7150
08:48:47,560 --> 08:48:49,000
And it's just me messing around as well.

7151
08:48:49,720 --> 08:48:52,459
Thank you Pigeon for the 250.

7152
08:48:52,459 --> 08:48:53,819
You know, if you go into the settings,

7153
08:48:53,819 --> 08:48:55,979
you can edit the limit of NPC Sims.

7154
08:48:55,979 --> 08:48:57,819
You get to parties with like a hundred people.

7155
08:48:58,459 --> 08:49:00,799
I was just wanting you to know that it was me

7156
08:49:00,799 --> 08:49:03,040
who suggested Sims for the first time.

7157
08:49:03,040 --> 08:49:04,959
And I was the one who caused this stream.

7158
08:49:04,959 --> 08:49:05,459
I did.

7159
08:49:06,560 --> 08:49:14,619
Every suggestion is great.

7160
08:49:19,319 --> 08:49:22,040
I'm grateful for a lot of the suggestions over the years.

7161
08:49:22,919 --> 08:49:24,040
Recommendations.

7162
08:49:24,040 --> 08:49:26,200
They've turned out to be amazing experiences.

7163
08:49:26,840 --> 08:49:32,860
But thank you for the 250.

7164
08:49:32,860 --> 08:49:33,360
Appreciate it.

7165
08:49:35,259 --> 08:49:36,299
Be where I live.

7166
08:49:36,299 --> 08:49:37,180
Thanks for the 250.

7167
08:49:37,180 --> 08:49:38,779
I hate when none of the original cast

7168
08:49:38,779 --> 08:49:40,139
is left when a series ends.

7169
08:49:40,700 --> 08:49:42,540
They always jump the shark with a baby

7170
08:49:42,540 --> 08:49:43,979
and then everyone leaves.

7171
08:49:44,700 --> 08:49:46,220
Can't wait for the spinoff.

7172
08:49:46,220 --> 08:49:48,060
I'm G'naught, a detective G'no.

7173
08:49:58,080 --> 08:49:59,360
There are a lot of subs today too.

7174
08:49:59,919 --> 08:50:03,950
Let's go ahead and start running them

7175
08:50:03,950 --> 08:50:08,220
so you can see all the subs.

7176
08:50:08,220 --> 08:50:08,939
Thank you everybody.

7177
08:50:09,659 --> 08:50:12,250
Much love to you all.

7178
08:50:12,889 --> 08:50:16,560
But thank you Be Where I Live.

7179
08:50:18,299 --> 08:50:19,259
And DubskiDude.

7180
08:50:19,259 --> 08:50:20,220
Thanks for the 250.

7181
08:50:20,220 --> 08:50:21,020
DubskiDude.

7182
08:50:21,020 --> 08:50:22,139
Don't know if this has been asked before,

7183
08:50:22,139 --> 08:50:23,099
but what are your chances?

7184
08:50:23,659 --> 08:50:25,099
What are the chances of an all-star

7185
08:50:25,099 --> 08:50:26,860
Jerma Rumble with all the old favorites?

7186
08:50:27,580 --> 08:50:29,020
Every Rumble adds new wrestlers

7187
08:50:29,020 --> 08:50:30,299
and I feel like we're drifting further

7188
08:50:30,299 --> 08:50:31,979
from what made the original Rumbles great.

7189
08:50:32,619 --> 08:50:33,419
If you considered it.

7190
08:50:33,979 --> 08:50:35,580
And the Jerma Trading Cards too.

7191
08:50:36,380 --> 08:50:38,720
Yeah, we actually talked about the Trading Card thing

7192
08:50:39,599 --> 08:50:40,959
like a week or two ago.

7193
08:50:40,959 --> 08:50:43,919
Just about how it was going to cost a ton of money.

7194
08:50:44,720 --> 08:50:47,279
And it needs to be something that I can reliably do

7195
08:50:47,759 --> 08:50:48,720
and be comfortable doing.

7196
08:50:49,520 --> 08:50:51,369
As to the Jerma Rumble stuff.

7197
08:50:52,090 --> 08:50:54,990
Yeah, it's just a different beast on Twitch

7198
08:50:54,990 --> 08:50:56,909
because how it used to be

7199
08:50:57,950 --> 08:51:00,990
is I would, especially 2k14.

7200
08:51:00,990 --> 08:51:02,509
A lot of things I think people don't realize

7201
08:51:03,720 --> 08:51:08,439
is in 2k14, I could make scenarios happen.

7202
08:51:09,319 --> 08:51:10,520
I could go in and edit.

7203
08:51:11,080 --> 08:51:14,279
And like for instance, when Demon Lord Zaraxos

7204
08:51:14,279 --> 08:51:16,119
in Jerma Rumble 3 goes into the ring,

7205
08:51:16,119 --> 08:51:18,430
that doesn't happen in the game.

7206
08:51:19,639 --> 08:51:22,759
I had to string all that together with editing

7207
08:51:23,709 --> 08:51:26,029
and different camera angles and stuff.

7208
08:51:28,009 --> 08:51:29,849
So it's not like, oh, why don't you just...

7209
08:51:31,849 --> 08:51:32,650
They're very different.

7210
08:51:33,790 --> 08:51:34,349
Really, yeah.

7211
08:51:38,569 --> 08:51:42,720
The new games that have come out since 2k14

7212
08:51:43,520 --> 08:51:45,840
got rid of a lot of the creative stuff.

7213
08:51:46,400 --> 08:51:51,200
You're not able to have somebody backstage

7214
08:51:52,090 --> 08:51:54,250
put in actors and have the characters

7215
08:51:54,250 --> 08:51:55,930
punch each other and throw each other through tables.

7216
08:51:56,889 --> 08:51:57,849
You can't do them anymore.

7217
08:51:59,740 --> 08:52:01,500
Now, one would say, why don't you just go back

7218
08:52:01,500 --> 08:52:02,380
and do 2k14?

7219
08:52:02,380 --> 08:52:03,340
We talked about that.

7220
08:52:03,340 --> 08:52:03,740
Why?

7221
08:52:03,740 --> 08:52:04,860
And here's another reason why.

7222
08:52:05,500 --> 08:52:08,139
I did everything I could do in 2k14.

7223
08:52:08,779 --> 08:52:11,020
Every little cut scene, every little story arc,

7224
08:52:11,020 --> 08:52:14,139
little cut scene edit that I could do, I did it

7225
08:52:14,139 --> 08:52:15,580
because there's only a finite amount of them.

7226
08:52:17,639 --> 08:52:19,000
One of the reasons why I even did

7227
08:52:19,000 --> 08:52:21,240
the Jerma Rumble live action is because

7228
08:52:22,169 --> 08:52:23,290
there was nothing else for me

7229
08:52:23,290 --> 08:52:25,610
to actually physically do in 2k14.

7230
08:52:26,680 --> 08:52:27,639
I couldn't do anything else.

7231
08:52:28,279 --> 08:52:30,759
So I was like, fuck it, I'll do it on my own.

7232
08:52:32,380 --> 08:52:34,459
I'll just hire people and make it.

7233
08:52:39,259 --> 08:52:43,790
But that's why they probably feel a little different now

7234
08:52:43,790 --> 08:52:47,790
because the tools that are in the new WWE games

7235
08:52:47,790 --> 08:52:48,909
are terrible.

7236
08:52:49,470 --> 08:52:53,069
They're just absolutely awful.

7237
08:52:53,069 --> 08:52:53,790
They're awful.

7238
08:52:54,590 --> 08:52:57,389
The only saving grace that these new WWE games have

7239
08:52:58,860 --> 08:53:00,779
are the import image feature.

7240
08:53:00,779 --> 08:53:03,580
And it's just a giant bandaid for not being able

7241
08:53:03,580 --> 08:53:09,709
to create characters that you want to create.

7242
08:53:09,709 --> 08:53:11,869
Now, I could go back to 2k14 just for the sake

7243
08:53:11,869 --> 08:53:13,709
of making better characters.

7244
08:53:13,709 --> 08:53:16,009
But I brought this up too.

7245
08:53:16,970 --> 08:53:21,369
Going back, that was a end of life PS3 game

7246
08:53:22,090 --> 08:53:23,930
that they didn't bring or didn't port anywhere.

7247
08:53:25,520 --> 08:53:29,040
They pushed the PS3 to the absolute limit.

7248
08:53:29,959 --> 08:53:32,279
And if you have more than a few characters,

7249
08:53:33,740 --> 08:53:35,580
making characters is hell.

7250
08:53:36,380 --> 08:53:38,860
There's so much slowdown, it lags.

7251
08:53:38,860 --> 08:53:40,619
The new games at least don't have that.

7252
08:53:41,340 --> 08:53:44,380
Once you get 5, 10, 12 layers on a character,

7253
08:53:45,930 --> 08:53:47,369
it's pain.

7254
08:53:48,299 --> 08:53:52,919
Even turning their bodies and looking at a different angle

7255
08:53:52,919 --> 08:53:55,560
drops the game down to like four frames a second.

7256
08:54:01,159 --> 08:54:03,000
The new ones now just crash in the middle of the match.

7257
08:54:03,000 --> 08:54:06,799
Yes, that's true.

7258
08:54:06,799 --> 08:54:08,319
But they've stripped a lot.

7259
08:54:08,319 --> 08:54:11,020
Is it still possible to remake old characters

7260
08:54:11,020 --> 08:54:12,619
in the new game and do it that way?

7261
08:54:14,619 --> 08:54:15,340
I probably could.

7262
08:54:16,380 --> 08:54:17,740
It wouldn't be that big of a deal,

7263
08:54:17,740 --> 08:54:19,099
especially if it was like an all-star thing.

7264
08:54:24,040 --> 08:54:27,479
I'm hoping that, and I've been saying this for

7265
08:54:28,200 --> 08:54:32,000
five straight years now, after 2k15,

7266
08:54:32,799 --> 08:54:36,639
man, okay, next year maybe they'll lighten up a little bit

7267
08:54:36,639 --> 08:54:39,279
and make the created characters a little less serious.

7268
08:54:40,240 --> 08:54:42,569
Oh, we're gonna get new creation sweet stuff.

7269
08:54:42,569 --> 08:54:43,529
Cool. Oh, what is it?

7270
08:54:43,529 --> 08:54:46,330
No, no, it's not anything interesting.

7271
08:54:46,330 --> 08:54:47,369
What about next year?

7272
08:54:47,369 --> 08:54:49,610
Nope. What about three years ago?

7273
08:54:50,619 --> 08:54:53,040
Going forward four years now?

7274
08:54:53,040 --> 08:54:55,040
Nope.

7275
08:54:55,040 --> 08:54:57,919
They want that game to be taken as a serious wrestling simulation

7276
08:54:57,919 --> 08:55:02,090
and not as a fun experience.

7277
08:55:02,650 --> 08:55:04,619
They want that to be a fighting game.

7278
08:55:07,180 --> 08:55:07,979
Strangely enough.

7279
08:55:08,540 --> 08:55:15,200
So that leaves me in a weird position to making characters and

7280
08:55:16,080 --> 08:55:18,319
God, I wish this was 2k14.

7281
08:55:18,319 --> 08:55:20,430
So instead of complaining about it all the time,

7282
08:55:20,430 --> 08:55:21,950
which I still do.

7283
08:55:21,950 --> 08:55:24,080
How many times do you hear me complain about the new games?

7284
08:55:28,669 --> 08:55:32,590
It's just not worth going back and dealing with old technology.

7285
08:55:36,560 --> 08:55:38,000
Very long-winded response, but

7286
08:55:39,959 --> 08:55:41,720
doing like an all-star thing would be pretty fun.

7287
08:55:45,279 --> 08:55:46,560
What about other wrestling games?

7288
08:55:46,560 --> 08:55:47,360
There really aren't any.

7289
08:55:49,000 --> 08:55:51,159
The 2k wrestling games are the only ones that

7290
08:55:52,380 --> 08:55:53,900
have really any.

7291
08:55:54,700 --> 08:55:58,569
I can't think of any other wrestling games that exist.

7292
08:56:03,020 --> 08:56:06,380
Unless you're talking about some of the 2d ones that are essentially flash games.

7293
08:56:07,930 --> 08:56:09,369
Yeah, that's the McDickey ones.

7294
08:56:09,369 --> 08:56:10,810
That's what I'm talking about.

7295
08:56:11,369 --> 08:56:12,330
Not McDickey.

7296
08:56:13,130 --> 08:56:13,770
And what's his name?

7297
08:56:13,770 --> 08:56:14,250
MDickey.

7298
08:56:15,049 --> 08:56:21,840
This whole caliber is kind of good.

7299
08:56:21,840 --> 08:56:23,279
You'd probably make some characters in that too.

7300
08:56:23,279 --> 08:56:24,000
Yeah, that's true.

7301
08:56:24,639 --> 08:56:28,299
But that's another, I guess, response for that.

7302
08:56:29,020 --> 08:56:31,950
Thank you to all the subs.

7303
08:56:31,950 --> 08:56:33,150
We had Jess, you got it.

7304
08:56:33,150 --> 08:56:34,270
Came in right at the end with 250.

7305
08:56:34,270 --> 08:56:37,069
This is an AI that creates faces.

7306
08:56:37,950 --> 08:56:40,349
Reload it to get a new face every time.

7307
08:56:40,349 --> 08:56:40,990
Have a good night.

7308
08:56:40,990 --> 08:56:41,950
I've actually seen this.

7309
08:56:42,909 --> 08:56:44,029
This person does not exist.

7310
08:56:44,029 --> 08:56:45,069
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

7311
08:56:46,110 --> 08:56:48,799
Is it weird that I don't believe this?

7312
08:56:53,240 --> 08:56:55,639
They could just say that these are AI faces

7313
08:56:55,639 --> 08:56:57,799
and they just upload the whole employee notebook.

7314
