1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,390
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Yo, what's up? How you doing? How you been? How's your day?

2
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:16,309
Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:25,280
And that was a little different than my usual intro, but tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Scout with the default Scouter Gun, the Mad Milk, and the Candy Cane.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,239
And this is gonna be a very casual gameplay commentary, kinda jump about a few things.

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,009
What happened right here? What happened right here? Look at this. How am I still alive?

6
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,130
You got a Demoman, a Soldier, and a Medic.

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,850
And I have the Candy Cane. I don't know how I made it out of that alive, I really can't tell you.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,850
But anyways, I wanna talk about a few things.

9
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,130
Very importantly, the gameplay. We're gonna do a little bit of a play-by-play here, as to watch me missing this Medic over and over again.

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,500
It's Yellow Gibbous Night, apparently, on this server. You're gonna see more than one, two, or even three of those.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,500
See the guy right there? What's with the Medics wearing the Yellow Gibbouses? I don't know. Maybe they're friends, I have no idea.

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,060
But anyways, I wanna say, apologize, very, very quickly, right first off the bat here.

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,629
I'm sorry that my livestream didn't happen last weekend.

14
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:22,209
And there was a couple reasons why. It was mostly due to the fact that I didn't... My internet's been, like, acting really stupid lately.

15
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:28,329
Uploading videos to YouTube and trying to stream, and really anything to do with online, it's been very slow.

16
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:34,730
So I'm hoping that I have the capabilities to stream for more than a couple hours,

17
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,849
because I initially wanted to do almost an entire day of streaming.

18
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,450
And if my internet can't handle it, then that's gonna suck really badly if I don't have the capabilities to be able to do it.

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:54,250
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plan the stream. Hopefully, if it doesn't happen this weekend, then it's just going to happen next weekend.

20
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:02,049
Because I'm not gonna put it off any further. If my internet's still being stupid, then I'm just gonna have to deal with it if it's still like that in a couple weeks.

21
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,609
Maybe I'll drop the settings a little bit. I don't know. I haven't really crossed that bridge yet.

22
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,120
But let's get back into talking about the things happening on the screen, because I never do that.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,159
I know a lot of you guys want to see more of the kind of gameplay-oriented content.

24
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,680
I do a lot of goofy stuff and a lot of weird, crazy, like, live shenanigans.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,560
But I am gonna try to get back at least once a month to talk about the gameplay here.

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,460
So it is on Turbine, as you probably already have guessed. I think I've said that already in the beginning.

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:38,439
But we're on Turbine right now, and Turbine for Scout is, like, impossible to play.

28
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:48,400
And the only reason why that is, is as a Scout, your main goal is to, at least on this particular game type, on Capture the Flag, you're supposed to go pick up the flag.

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,479
There are always at least two or three engineers in that flag room on Turbine, and on two forts.

30
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,979
So it's almost impossible to play Scout on maps like this, but I don't know why I'm doing it.

31
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,259
I think I just felt like doing it, and I said to myself, I don't care if I don't cap the flag or not.

32
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:11,150
I just want to run around and kill people in mid and try to hang around the hallways here and not go for the flag, if that makes any sense at all.

33
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,229
And a lot of you guys watching right now might say, well, Jerma, why didn't you just change to Demoman or a medic or something or a soldier or something?

34
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:23,550
Something that can take out sentry guns or help push the team into the intelligence room.

35
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,580
And the answer is very simple, and a lot of you guys can relate to this.

36
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,419
Sometimes you just want to play a certain class and you're doing well with that class.

37
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,099
You're not like, you know, just going zero points and not doing anything for the team.

38
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,819
You're doing pretty well and you don't really feel like changing.

39
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,259
And that class changes for me all the time.

40
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:48,020
So sometimes I'll jump on Demoman and play absolutely terribly and I'll jump on Spy and be doing well.

41
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,500
You just fit into the mood of the class that you happen to be playing at that given time.

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,699
As you can see right there, there's a sentry is literally right there.

43
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,620
That scout was pretty brave.

44
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,099
I give you two thumbs up for trying their scout, but it was going to be very difficult for you to get out of there.

45
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,979
And me, I'm just backing myself up.

46
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,379
I don't want to get in any trouble here because I know I'm on a streak.

47
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:16,620
And when you get on a streak like this, when you get like eight, nine, ten kills in a row and you can probably reach to one of the records you hold.

48
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,639
I think the record I have for scout kills in one life is 16.

49
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,480
And I just barely don't get it in this gameplay.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,079
And you play a lot differently.

51
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,600
And when you know that you could get that little thing to pop up and say, hey, you know, you passed your record.

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,079
It's like, oh, nice.

53
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,720
But you play very cautiously when that happens because you don't want to die.

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:44,660
Dying is like the worst thing when you know you're on a good streak because the times when you would have risked trying to do something, you will pull back and you'll be a little bit more cautious about it.

55
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,180
That's kind of what I was doing here, kind of playing the field a little bit.

56
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,939
And I guess it brings me to the question of the video, so to speak.

57
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,180
Doesn't have to be as scout, doesn't have to be as any particular class.

58
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,259
But what is the highest amount of kills that you have in one life?

59
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,220
Is it 40 with a demo man?

60
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,620
Is it like 30 or something?

61
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,540
I think my highest, I'm pretty sure my highest is with the heavy and it's like 27 or like 35 or something.

62
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,339
I can't remember, but I know it's just about 30, if not a little more than 30 with the heavy.

63
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm going to assume that most of us have most of those with the heavy or one of the big power classes.

64
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,300
But maybe differently, maybe some of you guys have that with sniper or spy or something.

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,740
Let me know and we're going to end the video there, guys.

66
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,040
So just a quick little casual commentary.

67
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,399
It's been a beautiful couple of days here in Boston.

68
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,439
Hopefully some of you guys are enjoying the summer.

69
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,720
Hopefully some of you guys are getting out of school right now.

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Some of you seniors in college are probably already out.

71
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,839
And congratulations if you happen to have graduated from either high school or college in the last couple of weeks or in the weeks to come.

72
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,399
And I'll see you guys all next time.

73
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,879
And of course, take care, everybody.
