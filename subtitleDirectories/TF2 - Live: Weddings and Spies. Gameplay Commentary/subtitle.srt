1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,869
Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here. We're going to do a live commentary tonight.

2
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,870
I'm going to be real relaxed, real laid back with this one.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,870
I've got a lot of things on my mind, and we'll talk about them very, very briefly.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,870
Nothing too big, don't worry. Nothing crazy, guys.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,870
It's just the fact that I have a wedding that I'm the best man of.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,870
Is that a spy? All the way, whatever.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,869
I'm going to be the best man at my brother's wedding in two days.

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,869
And I have to make a speech and everything, and that's not what I'm concerned about.

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,240
It's just weird, people growing up.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Friends, family. It's really odd.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,240
And it's not really depressing, but it's something that's in the back of my mind now.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,240
It's just odd. I don't know really what to say about it, but it's going to be a great, fun, exciting day.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
And hopefully it turns out...

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,859
Well, is that a cake on the ground?

15
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,859
The TF2 birthday stuff. Okay, I get it.

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,859
How did that not hit? Oh my god, dude, he's standing still.

17
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,859
Oh god. So I have a wedding.

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,859
And it should be a lot of fun. It's just really weird seeing your family grow up.

19
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,170
And seeing your friends grow up around you.

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,170
Some of you guys are too young to realize what I'm talking about.

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,340
But some of you guys are a little older.

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,340
And you'll know what I'm talking about soon enough.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Watching everybody get married, watching everybody around you.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,340
But this is a live com. I wanted to get it out here tonight.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Because I'm not going to be able to do a video, obviously, in the next couple of days.

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,340
Because we're leaving tomorrow.

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,340
So I wanted to... I didn't even mean to do that.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,340
Oh, come on.

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,609
No. Get the assist.

30
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,609
This is on Gold Rush. This is on Leptor's server.

31
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,609
Technically it's mine and Leptor's server, but Leptor's really the executive producer of this server.

32
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:54,609
Are you a spy? Yes, you are.

33
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,609
Oh, get caught in that! Oh!

34
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,040
Yeah, Leptor's in this game. So Leptor, if you're watching, what's up, dude?

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
There you are.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,109
Oh, come on. Come on.

37
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:11,449
Oh, come on.

38
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:13,819
So yeah, that's mainly what I wanted to talk about.

39
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,819
Is the fact that Brother's getting married.

40
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,629
And I'm scared.

41
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,699
Give me some ammo.

42
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,870
Playing as a demo man. Just because I feel like it.

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,870
A lot of people... A lot of spies on our team, huh?

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,870
Well, not really. Only two. Seven on seven.

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,870
A lot of spies in general.

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,139
Let me catch somebody with one of these.

47
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,439
Let me catch somebody with this.

48
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,439
Oh, come here.

49
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,680
Come here now.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
This is a battle of wits.

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,979
A battle of wits right here.

53
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,979
Oh, I got you done.

54
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:59,500
Admirable attempt, though, my friend.

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,810
I thought you were going to get me.

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,810
So birthday cakes. This is Valve's birthday.

57
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,810
I guess this is their...

58
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,810
Well, not today, but it was.

59
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,819
Oh, boy.

60
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,819
Oh, come on. I'm going to die.

61
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,819
Nope.

62
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,490
There we go.

63
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,789
Get some stickies out.

64
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:22,789
See if I can't catch somebody coming around this corner.

65
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:26,379
And also, I'm still working on the livestreaming, guys.

66
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,379
I'm still working on getting that ready.

67
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,379
Getting that out to go.

68
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,379
I've had a lot of tips from a couple of dudes.

69
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,379
Oh, my God. Get away from me.

70
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,379
Oh, that was Leptor.

71
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:43,180
Leptor, you're a real son of a bitch.

72
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,180
I'm live-comming, by the way.

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,500
So...

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,439
If you don't know Leptor, you should.

75
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,090
Get off that cart!

76
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,090
Oh, come on.

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,349
Nice, nice.

78
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,349
Oh, question is, can I finish him off?

79
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,349
Question is, can I finish him off?

80
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,349
Question is, can I...

81
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,349
No, I'm not going to be able to do this, guys.

82
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,659
Somebody left in the comments before,

83
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,659
they said,

84
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,660
we want to see you fail,

85
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
because you never show gameplays where you fail.

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
And usually in my live stuff,

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,660
I don't do too great.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,339
I usually get

89
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,339
beat up pretty hardcore

90
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,339
in my live commentaries.

91
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,339
Because I have like a problem with

92
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,779
doing two things at once.

93
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,779
My brain can't really function that well

94
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,779
when I have to do two things at once.

95
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,779
So if I have to talk, then I have to talk.

96
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,779
If I have to play,

97
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,779
then I have to play.

98
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:46,269
And why am I just letting him get away with this?

99
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,449
So pretty much when I speak,

100
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,449
I can't play.

101
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,449
And when I play, I can't speak.

102
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,449
My mind is one track.

103
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,449
Oh, come on now.

104
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,449
You're a spy. Come on.

105
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,449
Yeah, great. Nice job.

106
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,839
Nice job, spy.

107
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,399
Oh, can I finish him off?

108
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,399
I couldn't do it last time.

109
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,769
Oh, son of a bee. Here we go.

110
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,389
Four more minutes, lads.

111
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,040
Let's get some...

112
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,790
Oh, I think that's lepter right there.

113
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,790
Oh, I missed.

114
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,100
He did too, though.

115
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Oh, god.

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,730
Nice. Nice shot.

117
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,899
But if anybody else in the comments

118
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,899
could just let me know

119
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,899
if you had a family member get married.

120
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,899
My sister got married a couple of years ago.

121
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,899
But what was your experience

122
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,899
with somebody in your family

123
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,899
getting married or somebody you know,

124
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,899
a close friend getting married or something?

125
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,899
I'd really like to know because it's really interesting to me.

126
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,829
No, they're going to win.

127
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,519
Uh-oh.

128
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,519
Better get these on the card.

129
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,220
Three minutes and 57 seconds.

130
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Question is, can we do it?

131
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,420
Doesn't really look like it.

132
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
It looks like they're getting pretty close to winning.

133
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,589
What do we got right now?

134
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:21,759
Actually, we're doing all right.

135
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
Oh, spy.

136
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
Fine. You want to play that game?

137
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,199
Where'd you go?

138
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
Oh, god damn it.

139
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,629
I knew that was going to happen.

140
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,629
I knew that was going to happen.

141
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,629
Like, I guaranteed myself coming around that corner.

142
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,870
Somebody, two scouts on the card.

143
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,870
Somebody do something.

144
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,689
Oh, can I?

145
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,759
Kaboom.

146
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
By the way, see my new hat?

147
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,759
If you didn't see my new hat, I'll show you.

148
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
I finally got the towering pillar of hats.

149
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
It is the stupidest,

150
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
most funny, entertaining thing in the game,

151
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
I think, and I'm so glad

152
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
that I finally have this

153
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,759
really dumb hat.

154
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
The thing is, I hate when people wear this hat.

155
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
It's so obnoxious.

156
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
It's just like, dude, will you take that thing off?

157
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,899
The thing's annoying.

158
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,899
What? Oh.

159
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,199
I was going to say.

160
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,300
Lag, huh?

161
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,600
But yeah, I'm still working on the live stream

162
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
thing, guys, and my first game

163
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
that I'm going to live stream is probably

164
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,779
going to be obviously TF2.

165
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,779
The other game

166
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,779
is probably going to be Deus Ex.

167
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,779
Because I bought Deus Ex.

168
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,779
I was really, really raring to go to play Deus Ex.

169
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,779
And now I have it, and I haven't

170
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,779
played it yet, so I figured that's a good outlet for it.

171
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,269
And if you guys don't want that,

172
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,269
let me know, because I will

173
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,269
take it into consideration, but it's definitely

174
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,269
something I want to do. My live stream, I think

175
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,269
I want it to be, because some of you

176
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,269
might remember, a lot of you newer subscribers don't remember,

177
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,269
but about three or

178
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,269
four weeks ago, I came out with a new

179
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,269
Let's Play series of The Witcher 2.

180
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,269
And it didn't really go over

181
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:04,269
so well with people.

182
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,269
Didn't really get too many views.

183
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,269
I can understand, because I know that people

184
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,269
don't want to sit through a

185
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,269
freaking 500 hour game

186
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,269
and all these cutscenes and stuff.

187
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,269
But I figured, what a good place for a live stream

188
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,269
to do that.

189
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,269
So if you guys don't mind, during my live stream

190
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,269
hopefully I can play some of those games

191
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,269
and you won't be too annoyed.

192
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,269
Oh boy, right out of the gate.

193
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,269
Oh, where'd it go?

194
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,269
Where'd the Uber go? There it is.

195
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,220
Oh, that was...

196
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
I don't think they had a century console.

197
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
I'm not going to call that a fail Uber.

198
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Yeah, they only have a level one.

199
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,460
That's not a fail Uber.

200
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,340
Maybe it was, but you know.

201
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Like I said, talking and playing at the same time.

202
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Live comms are not my strong point.

203
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
But they are a lot of fun.

204
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Because you get to see the real, raw Jerma.

205
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,580
Oh, by the way

206
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,580
speaking of my videos

207
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Jerma, whatever.

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Go watch the video that's up on Pixel Enemy right now, guys.

209
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
It's out there now. Scout, Milkman.

210
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
It's getting a pretty good response so far.

211
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Hopefully you guys enjoy that.

212
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Oh boy, I heard stab. Yes, I knew it. I knew it.

213
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,580
No!

214
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
I'm going... Oh god.

215
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,580
No!

216
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Oh wow, I can't believe I...

217
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Hey, this is a tip for you guys.

218
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Especially for those new guys.

219
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
If you are on a cart

220
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
or you're on a point and you hear

221
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
a stabbing sound, if you hear that like

222
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
it sounds like a...

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Make sure to turn around because most of the time

224
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
that's somebody getting stabbed on your team.

225
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
So listen for that.

226
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,220
Listen for that stabbing noise.

227
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Oh my god, I'm getting owned.

228
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,899
What am I? Eleven and ten.

229
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,899
One for one.

230
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,080
Whatever. I'm having fun.

231
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,580
Yeah, eight on seven.

232
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,389
Playing with my boy Leptor.

233
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,210
Yeah, let's see.

234
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,409
We've got to move this cart.

235
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,409
We've got to move to get this cart moving.

236
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:06,419
There we go. Oh...

237
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,169
No, don't you dare.

238
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,169
Don't you dare.

239
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:13,169
Give me the help. Nice.

240
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:15,169
Oh come on, come on.

241
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,100
What? He just got backstabbed by nothing.

242
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Did you guys see that?

243
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,779
If you're watching right now, go back

244
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,779
like five seconds to when that

245
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,779
soldier just got backstabbed.

246
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,779
He didn't get hit by anybody.

247
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,779
He just magically died from a backstab.

248
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,340
Oh, I better sticky jump.

249
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,460
Oh god, this is nonsense.

250
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
Hear that stab? There he is.

251
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Oh, I didn't save the medic.

252
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Oh my god. Oh my god.

253
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Wow.

254
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,090
Oh my goodness.

255
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,090
I'm the only one left.

256
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,090
And then there was one.

257
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,090
Oh, Christ.

258
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,090
Oh, I'm done.

259
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,090
Might as well just sacrifice myself.

260
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,659
You know, let's...

261
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,659
I need an engineer.

262
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,659
An engineer is my favorite class, as you know.

263
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,830
I'm going to wake up for a loadout right now.

264
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,460
No, I don't want to

265
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
use that. Stick with this.

266
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,399
Actually, you know

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
what? Why not? I'm going to use it.

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,639
It's not what I really

269
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,639
want to do, but not very many

270
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,639
gameplays with this thing, so I figured why not?

271
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,139
I'll try it.

272
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,759
Got the spies. Oh, boy.

273
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:37,179
Oh, boy. That thing. Wow.

274
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,179
That thing's really bad.

275
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,179
That thing is really bad.

276
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,009
Man.

277
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,009
Wow, I shot twice. I didn't...

278
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,500
I hit him. I'm going to have to look

279
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
back at that and see how much ammo I actually got.

280
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,620
That was really bad.

281
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,379
Wow. Oh, somebody got a

282
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,429
collateral. I got to get like a

283
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,429
heat shot on somebody. That's not going to work.

284
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,299
No. I'm just going to get myself killed.

285
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,009
Oh, come on.

286
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,700
You're going to do what we like that? You're going to do what we like that?

287
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh, this is...

288
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
You know what? Forget it. Not working out.

289
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm not even going to pretend like I'm going to try and use this thing.

290
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
I said there's a...

291
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Oh, nobody does this. There's no gameplays with this thing.

292
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Maybe that's because it sucks.

293
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,870
They'll buff it, don't worry.

294
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,049
Watch out, spy. Spy, turn around, turn around, turn around.

295
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,419
I got you. I saved you.

296
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,409
I saved you, Johnny.

297
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,250
Not really, because he was a dead ringer.

298
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,250
Oh, you're done.

299
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,250
You're going to come around that corner and you're going to get yourself killed.

300
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,490
I told you.

301
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,370
Give me that crit.

302
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,399
Spy. Just bumped into a spy.

303
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,399
Can we just please win this game? Oh my god.

304
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,110
That's not a good place for that.

305
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,019
It has to go right here.

306
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,899
Get killed. Nice.

307
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,899
Destroy it. Put it right back.

308
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,899
Oh, come on.

309
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,840
Are you serious?

310
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I saw that. That was not a bad...

311
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,909
Oh, god.

312
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:23,309
Alright.

313
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,259
Might as well put a teleporter down.

314
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,259
That's probably going to get sapped and destroyed anyways.

315
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,759
Not like it matters.

316
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,320
What the...

317
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,629
No assist. Crap.

318
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,769
Oh my god, leave me alone.

319
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,940
You know what? You're dead.

320
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,840
I'm going to punch you in the face.

321
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,720
God damn it.

322
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,690
We got a pyro on the team.

323
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,210
Oh, this is not looking so good.

324
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,379
Livecom.

325
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,610
Me getting my ass kicked.

326
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,610
Now, I could just stop talking and probably play

327
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,610
ten times better.

328
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,610
But, as you know,

329
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,909
that's not the fun of a livecom.

330
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:20,049
Alright, I can't be an engineer.

331
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,049
I got to be a power class.

332
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,059
This is not working out.

333
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,059
This is not working out at all.

334
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:32,500
Power class. Let's do it.

335
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,379
For the love of god.

336
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,190
They have this spawn camping.

337
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,190
Oh, man.

338
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,250
Okay, time to change this.

339
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,009
Alright.

340
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,590
Okay, got the scout.

341
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,690
Where is he? Where is he?

342
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,059
No, no. Alright, they're gone.

343
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,059
Where's that spy? Keep running into him.

344
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,929
Spy at spawn. Be careful, guys.

345
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,100
Oh, crap. I can get it.

346
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,929
Yeah, we got it. It's all good.

347
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:17,100
Get out of here, dude.

348
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Somebody has to kill that guy.

349
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,110
Pyro time.

350
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,110
Yep, you saw it here.

351
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,110
You saw it here first, guys.

352
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,110
Rage pyros. Rage pyro.

353
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,809
Alright, let's do it.

354
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,110
Let's go with the default.

355
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,110
Default flamethrower.

356
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,480
Default shotgun.

357
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm going to do it like this.

358
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,789
I'm doing it like this right now.

359
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:48,850
Yeah, we're doing it like this now.

360
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,850
Oh, the question is, yeah, he's going to kill me.

361
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,850
No, you're a spy again.

362
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,559
Spy's all over the place.

363
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,529
So what was that? Four classes

364
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:02,769
in five minutes?

365
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,769
Jerma, get it together here.

366
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:11,100
Jeez. Medic.

367
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Come with me. We'll make this happen.

368
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,470
What the hell?

369
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,779
Oh, my God.

370
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,779
Dude.

371
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,529
Oh, I would play

372
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,529
not...

373
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,419
Alright, whatever.

374
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,419
We are getting absolutely dominated

375
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,419
right now. This is just ugly.

376
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,419
This is really ugly.

377
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,419
Yeah, get out of here. Get out of town,

378
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:44,139
buddy. Check for spies.

379
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,379
Yeah, get out of here. Get out of town.

380
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,379
Where is he? There he is. Yeah, get out of town.

381
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,100
There's more of you.

382
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I'm going to eat this sandwich. I'm going to die.

383
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
He's definitely a dead ringer.

384
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,340
I just don't know where he is.

385
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,899
I got to get up here. I'm going to do some...

386
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,899
Oh, yeah, of course. Of course

387
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,900
that's what's going on. Give me a break.

388
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,130
Oh, die, you little

389
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,130
squirrely mother... effer.

390
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,519
I get you. I got you.

391
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,140
You ain't getting away. You're dead.

392
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,789
Oh, come on.

393
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,670
Where's that medic?

394
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,670
Get out of here. Alright, alright.

395
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,849
You're good. You're cool. I just totally

396
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,849
stole you. Let's go.

397
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,650
You want to do this? Uh-oh.

398
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,890
Server's lagging out. What does it say?

399
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,890
Pyro. Hey, take the sandwich. Take the sandwich.

400
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,029
I'm going to get backstabbed in three, two, one.

401
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:48,029
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it, guys.

402
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,529
I knew it.

403
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,529
Had to get rid of that soldier though.

404
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,269
Wow. This is bad.

405
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,420
Don't matter. Because I'm going to get out here

406
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
right now and I'm going to win the game. Ready?

407
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,299
Watch this. Ready?

408
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,180
No more screwing around. Are you a...

409
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Okay. Okay. Yep.

410
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,920
So many spies.

411
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,670
Alright. Let's do it. We got it.

412
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,670
Alright. Stick with it, guys. Stick with it. We got this.

413
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,289
I need to heal. There we go.

414
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,779
Oh, I'm not winning this fight.

415
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,779
Get up there, Pyro. Come on. Get some damage.

416
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,339
There it is. There it is.

417
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,579
Oh, spy. Where are you?

418
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,819
Yeah. Yeah.

419
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,769
Get out of town. Oh, spy going to spawn.

420
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,650
Watch it. Gotta get on that cart.

421
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,650
But I have no life because the spy just took it.

422
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,769
Give me that birthday cake.

423
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,670
Oh, brass beast heavy.

424
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,299
No.

425
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,299
Oh.

426
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,599
God.

427
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,609
I want to take it back

428
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,609
and watch this and see how many times

429
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,230
I get killed by that spy.

430
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,230
I bet you it's...

431
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,730
I've died 23 times in this server.

432
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,539
I bet you

433
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,539
it's at least like a couple... I bet you it's at least

434
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,539
a dozen times I've died from that spy. Same spy.

435
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,539
We'll find out if I look.

436
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,539
Alright, I'm going to do some bird of prey

437
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,539
crap here. Here we go.

438
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,539
Oh, my God.

439
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,539
Oh, my

440
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,960
God.

441
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm going to name this livecom

442
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,140
Spies Are Insane.

443
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,380
No, don't give them the satisfaction.

444
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Alright, well, hopefully you guys enjoyed this

445
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
livecom. Check out my video on Pixel Enemy

446
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
and wish me luck at this wedding, guys.

447
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
It should be interesting.

448
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
I gotta do a speech and everything like I said before, so...

449
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Take care, everybody.

450
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
See you all soon and take care, everybody.
