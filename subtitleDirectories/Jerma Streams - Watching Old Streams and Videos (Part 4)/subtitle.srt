00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:14,300
Hello. Good afternoon, good evening. Good to see you again. Welcome to an interesting stream.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:21,589
This is going to be like, I don't like anything we've ever done before. Weird voice? What?

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:33,159
My effects aren't on. They shouldn't be on. Real voice? This, yeah, this is my real voice.

4
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:45,060
So what do you want me to tell you? I thought I had my sound effects on. You fixed it. Oh, I did?

5
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:58,359
Okay. Anyways, today we're going to do something different. This is the culmination of the last

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:09,819
16 hours of time. If you were not here a couple days ago, or not even like a day and a half ago,

7
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:18,180
we were talking about how funny it would be if there was a way for us to watch old videos.

8
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,459
You know, you've seen those streams before, right? Not only watch old videos, but all of them have

9
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:36,200
every single stream and every single video I've ever done be available to skip through. And what

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:48,359
would that even look like? What does my entire almost 10 year career look like? Did we just get

11
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:57,670
subs? Hold on. How many? Was that 10? Oh, shit. I don't even have my fucking thing ready. Yeah,

12
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:07,700
I said it like that. Career. And we can find out today. Because after talking about all that,

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,300
and hey, wouldn't it be funny if we could just like get a random timestamp and go through a

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:23,509
random video? Lazy Luke made it. Actually made this capable and possible. We are going to do

15
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:28,310
something very interesting today. Holy shit. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:40,150
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't even have my

17
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:49,060
dashboard open. Hold on a second. I got like seven windows open. What just happened? Hold on. It's

18
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:58,469
loading. It's loading. It's loading. Oh, you know, Kazzy gave 10 community subs. Thank you, Kazzy,

19
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:07,979
for the 10 fucking community subs. And then thanks to Freddy Dread for the $500 in bits.

20
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:26,500
That's 50,000 bits. An absolute madman. Just a true madman. 500 bucks. Holy shit. And then great

21
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,539
Canadian FK Club, 10 community subs. Austin Atlantis, 10 community subs. It's just, it's the

22
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:39,800
hour of money. It's the money hour. He's going to turn into the fucking Monopoly man. I should

23
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,900
just start wearing a monocle. Do they even make those anymore? Can you buy a monocle? By the way,

24
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,240
isn't a monocle just a magnifying glass that you stick on your eye? Right? That's what it is.

25
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,580
The only people that use monocles are, are people that sell jewelry, like

26
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:05,020
diamonders, whatever they're called. Jeweler. That's it. Another 10 community subs from Labster.

27
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,139
Holy shit. All right. All right. We got, we got all, this is a lot of money. This is, this is too

28
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:17,189
much money. Uh, Freddy, Freddy, that's fucking insane. That's, that's 500 bucks right now.

29
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:23,930
Hey, hey, any, any, any diamonders in chat? Any diamonders? Am I loud today? I feel like I'm

30
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:32,089
loud today. Am I loud today? I feel like I'm wicked fucking loud. Is that better? Am I wicked? Am I

31
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:39,019
not wicked fucking loud anymore? Why am I this loud? I'm looking over at it. Hey, that, that,

32
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:44,329
that, that, that, that, that, that, that's better. That's not as insane as it was before. I'm always

33
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:52,860
quiet. Yeah. I'm always quiet, but now I'm always loud right now. All right. So, uh, thanks for these.

34
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:04,230
Yeah, that's a hundred. Oh my God. That's fucking so much money. That's a thousand dollars.

35
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:14,170
That, that's, wait, that's five. That's a thousand dollars, Freddy. Freddy. Freddy,

36
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,209
that's a lot of money. Freddy, you've given me like 10 grand, Freddy. Freddy, that's a shitload.

37
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:28,009
Holy shit, Freddy. A hundred more subs on top of the $500. I think Freddy Dread has given this

38
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:43,399
channel more than 10 grand. Holy shit. Wow. Freddy. And there's not even a message on this, on

39
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:54,459
the $500 donation. Not even a message. He's just like, boom, take this money. I will. Holy fuck.

40
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:04,310
It's your birthday. Well, it's not, but I can pretend it is. Anyway, I want to show you something

41
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,550
really, really, really fucking cool. So while we can, we can take a minute before we start this,

42
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:25,350
but take a look at this. This is my entire life, about 90% of my entire life. There's

43
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:36,519
3217 hours of videos and streams that is linked into here. This is every live stream I've ever

44
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:45,750
done and every video I've ever made. If you want to know what that looks like, take a look at this.

45
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,870
This page loads a random moment out of all German videos and streams. Although there are a lot of

46
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,509
main channel videos, they are unlikely to be played because they have such a compact duration.

47
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:08,089
And they do. Here's some statistics. Almost 1500 total videos, 778 archive streams and 712

48
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:17,959
main channel videos. So if you take a look at this, the, the amount of hours, most of the hours I've

49
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:25,029
ever spent on the internet have been from a stream. So when I press this button up here,

50
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:29,420
something very magical is going to happen. The first thing that's going to happen is it's going

51
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:40,019
to load a random fucking video and a random timestamp in that video across 3200 plus hours.

52
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:46,180
What also is going to happen is a timer is going to pop up in the top left corner of your screen.

53
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,300
That timer is going to count down from two minutes. It's going to start at two minutes.

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:58,149
When that timer reaches zero, it goes on to another random timestamp. So that's kind of

55
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:03,350
interesting in itself. But you know what else is interesting? If we started, maybe decided to play

56
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:16,920
a little bit of bingo too. This is over 10 years of my life on a bingo card. Now, after two minutes

57
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,939
goes by and we go to zero, we're going to go to a new random part of my entire life. How you come

58
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:31,589
into play on this stream. German, what are you going to do about channel points? Well, I'll tell

59
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:40,889
you. Today, if you would like to add 30 seconds to the timer that is in the top left corner of the

60
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:48,419
screen, you are going to give 10,000 channel points as a highlighted message. We had to do it

61
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,250
as a highlighted message. That's why highlighted messages are not here right now. We had to do it

62
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,820
as highlighted message because that's the only way that the website can pull the data that we need.

63
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:10,700
So 10,000 channel points will add automatically 30 seconds onto the timer. But 10k is too little

64
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,379
for that. I know, I know. It might be way too little, but here's the thing. I'd rather adjust

65
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,139
up than adjust down because if it's, if I started like 30,000 channel points,

66
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,539
and then like in 20 minutes we bring it down, I would have scammed a shitload of people.

67
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:40,860
We're going to find out. So we're going to play bingo and we're going to, it's not active yet

68
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,009
because I know people are just going to be like, oh, give 10,000 channel points right now. So it's

69
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,059
not active until I, I'm going to press this fucking button. We're going to get started and then I'm

70
00:09:51,059 --> 00:10:00,519
going to turn it on. Remember the goal is, the goal is if you want to extend the current video

71
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,460
that is playing, this is not like, oh, we're, I mean, you technically are extending the stream,

72
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:16,679
but it's for the current video. Every video starts at 120 seconds. If you give 10,000 channel points

73
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,460
during that period, it's going to go up 30 seconds. When it reaches zero, we go to a new video.

74
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:29,929
I, let's, let's just go, but get a good screenshot of this because I'm going to need you guys help

75
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:42,570
for this one. Yeah. Get a good screenshot of that because I have to keep track of this too.

76
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:50,070
You ready? Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to start? I'm going to turn it on. Remember,

77
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:56,779
it has to be a highlighted message. Make sure your highlighted messages stay, stay. I'm looking

78
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,340
forward to this. I don't even know what the fuck, you could get anything. We could get fucking

79
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,509
anything from 10 years. Are you ready for me to press the button? It has to be a highlighted

80
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:15,080
message. I'm going to press the fucking button. Are you ready? Let's go. It begins in five, four,

81
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:27,639
three, two, wait, hold on. Okay. Hold on. I had to, I had to get the, the, okay. Ready?

82
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:36,500
In five, I have to be able to see this shit in five, four, three, two, roll the fucking dice.

83
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,139
Here we go. Welcome to the stream everybody. If there's anything, Nancy Drew, just let me know.

84
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:50,299
Thanks. I might just take you up on that offer. So what can I do for you? Tell me about,

85
00:11:51,019 --> 00:12:03,980
tell me about Paseo Del Mar High. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my God. One of the students was

86
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,820
murdered in the school last week. We're all pretending to be students. No, no, stop, stop,

87
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,659
stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm going to make it more expensive. I'm going to make it more

88
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:16,059
expensive. All right. I'm going to turn it off. I'm going to turn it off. I'm going to make it more

89
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,059
expensive.

90
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,470
Ten thousand is too small. Ten thousand is too small.

91
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,590
Ten thousand is too small.

92
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,000
How long is this? This is just two hours. There's not even two hours in this VOD.

93
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,080
I can't play barnacle blast. Are you serious? That's a shame. No, no, no, no, no, no,

94
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:29,379
God damn it. Oh, you got to be shitting me. That makes a cool song. Let's find,

95
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:33,940
let's find our uncle. This is the most boring one. This is the most boring stream

96
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,240
of all the Nancy Drew streams. I can't refund bits. I can't fucking refund anything.

97
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,559
Oh my God. I should have fucking killed it so much further ago.

98
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,840
So what do you got for me? Well, I was hoping you could debrief me on the investigation.

99
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:08,120
Oh, sure, sure, sure. I'm just a bit. Well, my undercover assignments are usually not so

100
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,960
suburban. I can't believe it. I understand. I can't believe it. All right. Wait a minute.

101
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,200
I have a night. Oh, I fucking should have said this. The students know about any enemies.

102
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,960
All right. Listen to me. Listen to me. Nothing came up from searching his home computer,

103
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,799
cell phone or locker. I get a veto. I get three veto sneezes. I get three veto sneezes.

104
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,080
We suspect he was involved in something shady. Drugs, gambling or blackmail. That's where you

105
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,879
fit in. I can't fucking believe this is going to be two hours. See what you can find out.

106
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,919
We think he might have kept information about his activities in a notebook or journal. So

107
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:50,360
keep a lookout for anything like that. Anything else? Oh, 10,000 might be too much. 10,000 might

108
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,440
be too much. And it had to be Nancy Drew. Of course it starts with Nancy Drew. And all of

109
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,799
these fucking Drew motherfuckers over here have been waiting for this shit for weeks,

110
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:10,440
for actual weeks. And they got their opportunity right now. By the way, we got to pay attention

111
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:25,750
because there's a bingo card. What? What? Okay. I got to pay attention. I'm just going golf club.

112
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:39,350
Surf club is cool. That's cool. It's the locker. All right. Uh, I don't know this information yet.

113
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,799
All right. The gym. This is unbelievable. I'm coming.

114
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,320
Add something that's subtract. Oh, we don't, we don't wait. We don't have the capability for

115
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:02,309
that right now. We just started it. Sneeze and vid. Unroy. All right. What is that for?

116
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,559
Translate them into links instead. Like 10,000. I can't. No. Okay. For a second,

117
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,460
I thought that their mascot was a sock with boxing gloves. Is that, is that, wait, is that,

118
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,730
is that anything? Was that something on the bingo card? Check the bingo card.

119
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:37,690
All right. If, by the way, it's going up to 20,000 channel points. Grape, orange, soda, cool,

120
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:48,490
or spot cola. I would love to have a sip of cool cola. That's 20,000 channel points. It's probably

121
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:56,970
a puzzle. Spot cola, cool soda, orange soda. I am so angry right now, but it's like hilarious.

122
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,259
I need, I need more quarters. It's guys. It's already been like, how long has it been?

123
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:14,099
How long is this actually? Holy shit. You just kind of new girl at school. Do you realize what

124
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:20,180
destiny has brought you today? Yours truly Hector Sanchez, but you can just call me the Hulk. It's

125
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,180
an hour and 40 minutes. The Hulk? You are new around here. I play for the manatees,

126
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,460
one of the best teams in the state. I leave the others in the dirt, man. Soon it's college ball

127
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,740
and then the pros show time. That's not, no, surprise face. Who are the manatees?

128
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,099
Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee. That's only in the video that we're watching. It had to be

129
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:46,180
fucking Nancy Scott. I know what to do if I come across a manatee. Why would you immediately talk

130
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,099
about fighting, punch one and hurt one? Here's the worst part. I can't even

131
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,980
I'm not going to pause. I know what to do if I come across a manatee. It's yeah. Just

132
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,339
it's like a zero point zero zero two percent. These are a great team at a great school.

133
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:06,019
Everyone is cool. It's like a zero point zero two percent chance to get Nancy Drew first.

134
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:12,970
I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him. Sorry. Can't talk now. I got to go to practice

135
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:25,690
later. At this point, I could let I could just like go take a shower and come back who died.

136
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,619
I could go take a shower. Yeah, this school is pretty cool. Jake Robert, Jake Robert sucks.

137
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:38,900
I hate him. Oh, OK. You know, he he's dead. Oh, yeah. Well, welcome to the school.

138
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:45,480
Is that is that an impression? No, it's not. How's it going? How could I get into Jake's locker?

139
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,599
I could tear the door off with my teeth, but it just might be easier to ask how to knock it.

140
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,359
His locker was right. This is the worst Nancy Drew stream, by the way. Oh, this is so bad.

141
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,640
Tell me about Daryl Gray. He seems like a cool guy. His family used to sponsor the annual

142
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,960
football awards dinner until last year. You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.

143
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:13,960
Wait, what? Hold on. Vito Vito lost right now. But what if what if it happens again immediately?

144
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,279
He knows that he's OK. I'm so scared. If I veto this, what if we get Nancy Drew again?

145
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,539
He talked about how much he's like he sucks. And now he's like, oh, yeah, that's where the body was.

146
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,250
I'll talk to you later. That's a finance. Yeah, this is a psychopath. Just one veto like checked

147
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,130
every box of are you make it max out at 10 minutes? All right, we're going to find where's this?

148
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:54,250
In the trash. I test. I wasn't prepared for this. I'll do it for this to happen. 10 minute max.

149
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:07,589
I'll do the eye test and see how good I do. Oh, where is it? That's that's a surprise face, Kim.

150
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:25,509
E, V, I, F, O, R, E, Z, E, E, R, H, T, E, G, I can't get over this. P, K, O, O, B, Y,

151
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:50,500
R, T, C, Z, M, N, J, K, O, O, L, K, M, O, T, E, M. I don't know. B, F, F,

152
00:20:50,819 --> 00:21:04,599
A, L, E, E, U, L, K, Y. Boomer eyesight. K, A, P, I. All right, I have an idea. Should we add

153
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:12,490
like a hundred thousand channel points to skip? No, no, we can't do that. No, no, no, no, no,

154
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,049
we can't do that. You know, OK, when you when you go, OK, Jeremy, please cover one eye and do it

155
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,930
and you do it and then it's like, oh, do the other eye. And it's like, that's too many. But I can't.

156
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,690
It's all blurry. You can't. You can only do this once.

157
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,240
You actually can only do that test one time. You can't do the other eye to reduce time.

158
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,319
We did it. We don't have that set up for today. You got about half of that wrong. Ten minute max.

159
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:44,119
All right. What how what has it been so far? We're keeping right away. We're keeping track

160
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,839
of everybody. It's the that it's the light coming back into your eye. It's like all blurry.

161
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,359
We're keeping track of every every single highlighted point. What are you talking about?

162
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,519
So can a mod right now message me how many channel points, how many people highlighted

163
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:06,420
messages? What are you talking about? I'm fine. All right. I get I get three vetoes.

164
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:12,259
I forgot to say that I actually was going to say that I get three vetoes. When I cover one eye

165
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,220
and I cover one eye for long enough and I take my hand off that eye and I cover it, it's like

166
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:24,279
this eye that it was covered is all fucked up. Bro, don't you have a hernia? Yeah, it sucks.

167
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:35,259
You fucking liar. Then veto it. But I don't do I want to drink. All right. Do I want to use it,

168
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:41,349
though? That's the problem. This stream could be more than five to ten hours long. Do I want

169
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:48,869
to veto this right now at the beginning? You know what I'm saying? How do I get the hell out of here?

170
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:57,480
All right. Drink. But what if I want a I wish I could cool soda or should I get extra pop?

171
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,079
I'm going to do I have to use a video. Definitely. I think I have to use a video.

172
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,369
I'm going to use a video. I'm going to I this is this like this this this stream is so boring.

173
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:13,299
Like you don't want to watch this one. That is wasted quarter. All right. We're going to talk

174
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:24,660
to this walker. All right. All right. I'm sorry. I can't sit here for Nancy Trump for two hours.

175
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:41,180
I can't never exhaust. I can't do it. Regret. I'm vetoing Da Vinci. Bree Bree to one veto.

176
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,950
What is this murderous pursuits? Do a 10 minute stream delay.

177
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,990
Oh, this is like a multiplayer game. Field cart doesn't stream. I don't think anybody's stream

178
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,480
sniping. I don't. I remember this game. I haven't really seen that much evidence that it's happening.

179
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,819
Maybe it is, but there's no way I can avoid that. I'm not going to do a stream delay.

180
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,869
You want to turn on like a three minute stream delay.

181
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:17,609
Hey, how many seconds is 10 minutes? I can do that at this point. You only get one veto.

182
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:23,559
No, I get three. Hey, I'm still playing it though. Like I still am enjoying it.

183
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,519
All right. You guys seriously like you. It's called Presto Magesto. I'm not going

184
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:40,970
to use another veto. I have two more. Oh, my stomach is eating me alive.

185
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,779
Keep your eye on the bingo card. That's important. I don't even know if I can do that

186
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:55,140
being live. I think I have to set that before I start streaming. That's all right. Come at me.

187
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:05,769
I really don't think it's going to be that big of a deal. 30 seconds is too much.

188
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:13,769
Tell us about the Boston accent. I have two more vetoes. I have to get this right.

189
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,250
Thanks for the game, Jerma. And sorry about the circling. Your chat made me do it.

190
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:29,450
Wait, so somebody was in that game. Make it 10 seconds. What do you mean chat made me do it?

191
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:44,140
No, I think we're good. Yeah, I have to restart the stream for delay. Do I have anything

192
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,359
necessarily planned for the rest of the night? No, I mean, there are a couple of options, but

193
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,039
I'm having like a lot of problems right now with my stomach. This is the second time I've talked

194
00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:01,619
about like medical issues in two roles. Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem very silly.

195
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:08,279
I should have put that up here. That's all right. I think I'm nice. I'm stuck here, I think.

196
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:22,650
What am I in queue? What am I waiting for here? I'm ready. Yeah, my stomach is like in a knot

197
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:34,380
right now. Make it one. I am just drinking water and we're good. But we got a lot of fun stuff

198
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,150
going on this weekend. So is this the end of a stream? What am I talking like? I'll eat my

199
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:47,099
stomach. What are you five grow a pear? Oh my God. What is happening right now? This is like

200
00:26:47,099 --> 00:27:01,029
the middle of a stream. Jesus. Oh my God. That's inappropriate reading of chat. Tell me how you

201
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:10,630
really feel. Hunter. It's not that guy. It has to be that guy. I just blew the cool down. That is

202
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:19,640
inappropriate. Okay, where is that? Inappropriate chat reading. Where? Oh. As they like to opine on

203
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,359
the back streets of Limehouse. Floor below. They don't like it up, do they? All right, let's take

204
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,440
a look at what it looks like right now. All right, I'm going to try to actually win this one. Let's

205
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,519
go for it. Actually blind. No, that doesn't count for this. Take a look at what we got so far.

206
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:50,539
Now you guys have me paranoid for stream snipers. I got to go all the way around. I'll put the

207
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:56,740
webcam on so you can tell who the real one is. No, but this just looks like I'm on the same stream.

208
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,940
Floor below. I'm going to run right into them, I think, if I turn this corner.

209
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,059
I could just go like this. Hunter nearby. I really thought you would have come upstairs by now.

210
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:19,450
We got to hide. Damn. Is this like the ship? It is like a combination of it's not isn't the ship

211
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:25,289
like you talk like text to speech and shit. This is more the Assassin's Creed multiplayer

212
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:41,079
from. I need to get down the stairs. Keep doing it. Person is at one of the dinner tables.

213
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,400
Let's get a good look. It's the lady writer.

214
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:03,180
Where's my Hunter? Where's my Hunter? Where's my Hunter? Hunter right behind me.

215
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:12,680
Yep. Sayonara. Those who hesitate are lost. We got we need brass knuckles or we need a different

216
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:22,900
weapon. We only got 10 more. Don't say anything. There's a delay. Hunter's near. Shouldn't be. Nope,

217
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,970
right here. God damn it. I wasn't going to do it in time apparently. You heard those clicks.

218
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:35,450
You heard those clicks first place. Serious business. Damn it. That's not angry. I was

219
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,490
going like tickety tickety tickety tickety tickety. You know I was going tickety and it didn't

220
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:45,589
matter. No, that doesn't count. That's not the fucking ping. What's my ping? Well, they did

221
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:54,819
manage to get in first. 102 ping. That guy had zero. This guy's got zero ping. That's not. No,

222
00:29:54,819 --> 00:30:01,210
it's not. There we go. That's not molding. Molding is way different than this. Not even close.

223
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:07,910
Yeah, I'm gonna take a gamble here. I know it. Yeah. Sometimes your intuition pays off.

224
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:15,990
Most inspirational. Why is a TF2 video on the board? Well, that's because there's a 3.4% chance.

225
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:23,619
It's like the line. There's a 3.4% chance to get a German 985 video and a 1.2% chance to get a

226
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:32,119
Team Fortress 2 video. And that disguise on, that's fine. But those of you that are confused,

227
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,359
let me turn it down a little bit. For those of you that are confused, this is pulling a random

228
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:42,200
timestamp from every single video and every stream I have ever done. For those of you that

229
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:51,450
are confused. So when we get to zero, or if I veto, it goes to a random timestamp of a random

230
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,369
thing I've ever done on the internet. And the first two we got have been very, very exciting.

231
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:04,490
It's been Nancy Drew's stream, which I had to veto. And then arguably one of the most probably

232
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,220
boring streams I've done in five years, which is this. Oh shit. Man, thanks for the stun.

233
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:19,609
Appreciate it. That person was a player the whole time. Hunter is near. That wasn't a

234
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:30,940
tuber voice. This guy right here. Definitely. Yep. No, that's to be distinct. Oh my God. Oh my God.

235
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:38,950
That's not a strange noise. No, that's just, is that a strange noise? No, no, it's not.

236
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:49,960
Was it a weird noise? What was this guy doing? That was me going like, ah. He's on a fucking rampage.

237
00:31:52,299 --> 00:32:01,700
I gotta hide. I need a thing. I'm exposed. I'm exposed. Where are they? Lady right here?

238
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:09,140
No, that was a rumor. That was a rumor now. That was a rumor right now. Like in here. That wasn't

239
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,490
in the, oh shit, I gotta mute the microphone so you can't hear me. You're doing all right. I have

240
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:22,440
to get out of here. Fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Where are they? Just be in this. Oh, you were in the

241
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:34,259
circle. You were inside the circle. I ran right into the circle. Of course it was me. All right,

242
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:37,539
don't blow it. I got a commanding lead in the first place. Come back. We don't want to hear

243
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:48,630
this boring vlog. Well, why did you spend so much money to keep it here? There is a 0.04% chance for

244
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:57,539
you to get one of the Shmee videos. Don't you want to let this play out? When you see somebody

245
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:08,920
turn a corner there, I'm just going to activate it. I'm not going to veto this. Give me that weapon.

246
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:26,940
I want full exposure here. This is not, that's not. Tapping of running around. They're coming up

247
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:42,380
the stairs now. This pod is so boring. I'm going to activate my. This whole vod is just me going

248
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:53,940
like, okay. Got that guy. All right. If I attack that guy, walk around, hit this guy. Got him.

249
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,819
Got this guy. I'm not sure if I should have done that. Should I do that? Where's this guy?

250
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,220
I'm not sure. On the same floor. Pick this up. Okay. I think I'm still that person's target.

251
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:12,139
Question. Question. Question. Say question. Hey, question. Question. Did I get that guy?

252
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,340
Did I kill that guy? Should I go this way? What's up there?

253
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,159
Yeah, that was, that was, that was a Jeremy and I've learned to not be Jeremy.

254
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,639
I'm doing a different approach. He's laughing at his own jokes. He thinks it's so fucking funny.

255
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:50,420
Oh, this is the worst stream of 2020. This, this, this stream was like 2015. So sorry.

256
00:34:50,420 --> 00:35:11,929
We can't pull a stream from 2015 and make it worse than 2020. The first person that walks

257
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:21,269
in this door is my killer. The most improved streamer award. I can't be just complacent about

258
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:26,789
this. Five minutes. All right. What is five minutes in, in, in time? Three, what is it? 320?

259
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:33,340
How many seconds is five minutes? They are right down here. 300. Shit. I gotta make something

260
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:46,789
happen right now. One minute left. 320. 350. How many seconds is five minutes? 300. Shit.

261
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,760
Okay. All right. We'll keep it. We'll make it 300 seconds. When it gets to 300 seconds,

262
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,679
then you've maxed it out. All right. Here's the thing though. Some of you guys are going

263
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:09,590
to be pretty upset by this. All right. All right. 300 seconds is the back. I gotta get one person.

264
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:26,119
When you hit 300 seconds, it triggers it. It triggers the fucking kill swing. What the fuck?

265
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:36,389
10 minutes is better. All right. If you want five minutes, press one. If you want 10 minutes,

266
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:49,590
press two. So I can't hit that guy. What the? I got it. I had it. That was mine. That was me.

267
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:54,940
Oh my god. Five minutes it is. At 300 seconds, you're going to trip it.

268
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:04,579
I can do this. I can control this. Don't worry. All right. Well now for future. I didn't know that.

269
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:09,860
Like I thought that even if they're getting arrested. Okay. So here we go. Because then I'm

270
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,300
technically still their quarry, right? Every single one is going to get to 300. Well,

271
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,519
you don't know that. I thought that even if they get arrested, like I can go up and hit them

272
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,340
because that it's like they got stunned. No, the stream is this, this like what we're watching

273
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:38,250
right now. What a bunch of dog shit. Wait, the guard. Yeah. Get the fucking guards out of the

274
00:37:38,250 --> 00:38:01,659
game. Pointless. Mad. Oh, like what, what purpose do the guards serve? I don't see a purpose for

275
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:19,739
the guards. I don't. I'm just silent right now. That's how you can tell when I'm actually upset

276
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:24,940
about something. When I just sit there and I just sit there quiet.

277
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,659
For more than 20 to 30 straight seconds. Okay. So if a guard is like essentially stun somebody,

278
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,199
I'm technically still their quarry. So we haven't changed in five years. I don't know who it is and

279
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:46,380
I have to just hope I click first. You guys have been the same for the last decade. It's been more

280
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,260
than 300 seconds. If the counter is in the game, the guard seems like the most meaningless addition.

281
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,969
No, because people are going to count that as a veto. Wait, where's my one? What? Oh,

282
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,550
okay. That's not my mouse. That's, that's, that's his mouse. People are going to,

283
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:08,840
people are going to come back and count this as a veto. No one's going to count this as a veto.

284
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:28,980
You sure? Here we go. She's ready to go on a date. Let's get this right. The ego maniac stream.

285
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Bridget has a dog named beefcakes, whom she loves more than anything else in the world.

286
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,829
Beefcakes is a presumptuous pet. He is fond of removing pieces of your body that he presumes

287
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:45,019
to be of no use. Well, now you've capped it out. These have included on various occasions, pieces

288
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:52,380
of arm, leg, toe, whatever happens to fall into his cavernous jaws. Bridget is thankful that beefcake

289
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:01,849
likes you so. What do you think about this? I should keep quiet. If it ever came down to a

290
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:07,050
choice between me and beefcakes, I would be the one in the dog house. I'm going to poison that

291
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,110
animal one day. It's just a matter of time. I'm going to ask that beefcakes be kept in another

292
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:22,309
part of the house while I am visiting. Why? These are so extreme. I'm going to poison. I'm

293
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:27,110
saying this to her. These are spoilers. But watch the stream from two years ago. It's a matter of

294
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:33,420
time. Why would I say that? Can you guys still read that? Is that still legible? Like, can you

295
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:39,530
still read this? No, be quiet. Wimp. By the time the two of you get serious, you may be missing

296
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,650
one of your most valuable parts. What the fuck? You wanted me to say that I was going to poison

297
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:56,420
your dog? This is like mad again. No, what? Veto the spoilers. While on a date with Bridget,

298
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,900
you've discovered that you've forgotten your wallet. What will you do? No, be quiet. All right,

299
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,550
I'm out of here. Excuse yourself. Tell the story to the restaurant owner and ask if he will give

300
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:15,429
you an IOU. Excuse yourself. Drive home or to the bank. Get money and come back. Ever think of

301
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:20,389
trying out for the Olympic Decathlon? It's only a few more events than you've had to perform tonight.

302
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,110
Bridget gets a bit suspicious when she notices that the car is parked in a different spot.

303
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:31,269
I'm surprised that in three streams we have no... Your chest heaving while you try to catch your

304
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:38,900
breath is very romantic. We have no look at me, which is kind of odd. Can I get something to go

305
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,920
right here romantically? Is that wrong? Bridget admits that every so often when the two of you

306
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,679
are being romantic, she makes believe that you are a famous movie star. How do you feel about this?

307
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:59,030
No, that doesn't count. I have to do it. That's fine. Does that count? That's okay. That's fine.

308
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,510
Can you date me? Can we go steady? Can you be my wife now? Actually, this is quite a common way

309
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,110
for people, both men and women, to add variety to their relationships. The ultimate in recycling

310
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,230
content. I'm glad you were open enough to accept it. Now what if I told you that the name of the

311
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,150
famous movie star is Flipper? I'm just kidding. No, I'm just kidding. That would be fucked up.

312
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:28,250
All right. Another good date. Here we go. Can this stream be on the random video player?

313
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:34,739
I don't think so. The two of you are very cozy. Bridget begins to get very romantic

314
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,420
and respond in kind. She explains that she would really like to make love with you but doesn't have

315
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:47,300
any birth control. What will you do? Suggest that you satisfy each other without intercourse. By the

316
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,300
way, if we filled out this drug store, is she going to be mad about me driving and is the car

317
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:11,420
going to be parked in a different place? Dude, I'm going to get fucking flagged for this shit.

318
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:21,289
After 35 minutes of searching, you finally find a drug store that is open late. Laughing fit? No,

319
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:25,050
no, no. Laughing fit has to be like- You purchased the condom and rushed back to Bridget's house.

320
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,690
She's falling asleep in the living room and does not answer the door.

321
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:38,300
Fucking god damn it. Don't you work at the drug store? Here we go. We're about to move.

322
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:45,500
We're moving. As often happens in relationships, Bridget begins to gain access to your personal life.

323
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:53,820
Want to know what she finds out? Yeah, what is it? She finds out that you still play with toy boats

324
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:02,139
when you sit in the bathtub. Now that's personal. Does she know about the real boat that's in the

325
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:07,579
bay? Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

326
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:13,320
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Stick that into my gut, aren't you? Close. Go steady. You and Bridget

327
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:24,809
make a handsome couple, okay? We gotta live together. No, go on a date. Bridget has an annoying

328
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:29,690
habit that grates on your nerves. Here we go. I don't even like this person. I just want to

329
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,309
get married. Where are we going? When you go out to a restaurant, she licks her fingers at the table

330
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:39,349
and sometimes makes loud sucking noises. What do you intend to do about this? Fucking gross.

331
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:52,389
Three seconds. Here we go. A little sweep as Orson Welles, maybe a somersault slam,

332
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:58,949
whatever the hell that was. And Flanker now has an opportunity. This is an old one. Instantly

333
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,989
reversed. Dr. Roker is in no shape to be eliminated right now. He's still doing pretty well.

334
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:11,670
Ah, you tripped it. I said that and immediately he gets eliminated. Unbelievable. How old is this

335
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:19,980
one? The sheer strength of will. 2K17. And he's going to turn the tables. He turns the tables

336
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,179
immediately after getting almost a new one. And here comes the Snatacat. Snatacat's in the ring

337
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:27,820
now. Just praying nobody can see him. He's invisible right now. Nobody knows where he is.

338
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:34,070
They can't even tell he's there. And that's how you make a reversal. Oh. Ladies and gentlemen,

339
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:38,550
why isn't Flanker gets eliminated from the German Rumble? Not an entire game. Stamp on the bingo

340
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:45,909
card. As the Snatacat now makes himself visible to Orson Welles, who is in a little bit of trouble

341
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:52,809
here. Orson Welles. Oh, big backwards elbow there. Took him off guard. I thought he was.

342
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:58,869
This is the first live rumble, isn't it? Go ahead. Try to reverse Dr. Roker. You're going

343
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:05,639
to get this. It has to be. This crowd. They are so behind him right now. And the Snatacat.

344
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,929
Oh, shit. Here comes another serpent. It's the air serpent. Yeah. When you see an air serpent,

345
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:17,269
you know it's at least three or four years old. Guys, I think there's like three boys

346
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:22,230
surface left. Orson Welles gets a drop. No, he's still in it. Easiest content ever.

347
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:30,789
Was just making seven of these fucking guys. Snatacat drop kick. Chin buster. He was like,

348
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:36,599
holy shit, I could just have 10 fucking people be the same person. He's still in it. Kissing

349
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:43,300
the elbow. You get to see another elimination here. Could see a easy Pete elimination.

350
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:51,860
It's possible. I think who even wins this? You know, you could take that opportunity to

351
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,760
attack him. Fucking keep doing that. And here comes the tooth goblin.

352
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:05,320
Half these characters are sorcery related. He's like just kind of rid of rage. He's seeing red

353
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,519
right now for the tooth goblin. He hates this fucking spell. He's just destroying right now.

354
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,440
He came in the ring like a bullet. By the way, just started smashing.

355
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,719
Derma rumble charity edition should be within the next few weeks. Backstage.

356
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,480
Sincerely pissing off the air serpent. Look at the top of your screen. Now we have an

357
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,440
opportunity. That's it. See you later. Easy Pete. That's an elimination. Oh, too bad. Easy Pete.

358
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,880
Add should be on the bingo card. It is carrying slam there on to the goblin.

359
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:52,469
As he goes down, Pete is gone. It's so funny to see in the the serpent edition. I know pretty much.

360
00:47:52,469 --> 00:48:01,320
Yeah. At this point. Oh, no. That's going to be gone here. Does that does that count as making

361
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:09,210
the same joke? Does that count as making the same joke within the last week? No, it doesn't, right?

362
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:21,980
That's not a joke. That's me. That's a reference, is it? No. You pick him up. How can you have that

363
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:29,019
I don't think that counts. It's a reference. He's looking into doing push ups, whether on top of

364
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:38,300
somebody next to somebody. Well, they're in his hands. The goblin, the tooth goblin has an

365
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,139
opportunity. No, it was an observation. There you go. Yeah, exactly. Dr. Roker's not taking that shit.

366
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:51,179
In comes the next contestant. Who wins? No, no, no. James Madison, James Madison with his appearance

367
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:55,099
came in around the same time last time. It had to be a president in every one.

368
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:03,110
Snap suplex there right under Orson Welles. I can't believe I almost sat there for two hours.

369
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:09,269
He was like a ninth president or something. For Dancy Drew. I'm so glad I used Evito.

370
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:17,750
Sidewalk slam there onto the two Roker. Air serpent is currently. No, he's all right. He

371
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:22,150
just jumped and landed on top and did a bulldog. I think that was scammed a bunch of people.

372
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:31,059
I had to do it. I had to do it. Who just who just punched the air serpent? I don't know.

373
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:36,099
Air serpents crawling now as if like he's got like no nothing. Nothing on this one guy. Sorry.

374
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:43,500
Here he is. Here's the guy. I have no idea who the fuck he is. Here he is. Here's the mystery guy.

375
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,829
Crash incoming. If it's going to happen, it's going to happen like right now.

376
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:52,710
You know what's ridiculous? Drew crew was going to be a slot on here and it would have been

377
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:04,440
instantly circled. Because there was like no way it was going to happen.

378
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,739
Video too quiet. Yeah, I'm trying to adjust it.

379
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,659
Gone. Mystery man eliminates. He better not fucking win.

380
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,699
Less than 60 seconds to go to the next one. Tooth goblin. Wow. The air serpent now seems to be

381
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:36,059
in a little bit of a problem here. That's not it. No, that's okay. He's getting his chest pushed.

382
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:39,980
He's getting his head. He's getting his stomach smelled by Dr. Roker.

383
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,110
And that's no, it is barely the air. Wait, doesn't it? Doesn't a serpent is he though,

384
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:54,550
win this shit? Can you stay in? Did I let that happen like four years ago? Oh man. What the

385
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:59,349
fuck was I thinking? Doesn't look like he's going to get it this time. Sorry, Dr. Roker, but

386
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:03,590
nice right hand. He's going to get it this time. Possibly again with the chest push.

387
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:10,789
He gets stomped in his tracks. Fortunately. And here comes frogman. Oh frogman. From dark souls

388
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:28,860
three. And a very good. Here we go. Let's go. The sims for murder house.

389
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,409
We could get a few here. Oh no, I've heard about this guy. I gotta get out of here.

390
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:40,260
We could get a few bingo cards here. Get over here. You tripped it. I'm going to find you.

391
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,960
There you are. I'm the local resident fucking murderer. Here we go. We could get like three

392
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,219
or four of these here. We really could. Why'd I stop? This is three hours and 20 minutes into

393
00:51:53,219 --> 00:52:01,289
what the second stream may be. Her head is just a swivel. And I'll tell her a joke.

394
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:09,449
I smell so bad. So many nerds. At this point, was there violence involved in this one?

395
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:20,659
Well, that was a log on disabled, disabled reactions, disabled cops. Wait, this might be

396
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:26,780
the tail end. Mod info, make partners in crime. It's possible this is the tail end. Exclude the

397
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,780
sim from getting killed. Enable drain all blood interaction for the sim. Okay. What the hell does

398
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:44,230
that mean? Look at all these urns. I gotta get out of here. Did I say it? Did I say I gotta get out

399
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:59,880
of here? I gotta go? Did I? No, I didn't. Did I? I did? No, I didn't say it. No, did I? You said,

400
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:06,170
I gotta get out of here. Oh, God damn it. Really? Oh, he doesn't care.

401
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:22,699
Clear reputation on social media. Somebody's going to walk by and throw me a doll, right?

402
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:33,900
Come on. You know, you like this, dude. Don't start laughing. Don't start laughing.

403
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:48,179
He fucking ran away. No, he wanted nothing. That is not a laughing fit. That is a chuckle. That is

404
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:53,130
a slight chuckle. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I think he was just a little nervous at first.

405
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:06,389
No, no, he's gone. Okay. Practice singing. Uh, what about rage? What does rage mean?

406
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:10,710
Dude, but we don't have the yesterday's stream. No, not, we don't have that today.

407
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,630
That's like freaking out and smashing shit.

408
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:25,670
Here he comes. Oh, fuck. He's coming over here. Wait, doesn't like death shoot somebody with a

409
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,949
gun. No, I somebody shoots death with a gun. What's the, what's the drink? All blood.

410
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:38,980
When does that happen? I'm going to drink all this lady's blood and see what happens. Deadly

411
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,340
slice of machete bash head. No, I don't think I've seen any of this yet at this point of the

412
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:53,500
stream. Non-deadly. See, I'm like, oh, non-deadly. What's this do? What's that? Where the hell is it?

413
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:04,809
Holy shit. I didn't enable it. I thought I did. Everyone else is already dead. Wait,

414
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:08,969
hold on. Everybody at this point was, it's already dead. More choices. Uh,

415
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:20,389
rain, all blood. Okay. So we're catching like the cool down. We're catching the cool off period.

416
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,949
You need to be, you need to be a vampire. Oh,

417
00:55:30,389 --> 00:55:35,030
like asking chat. Hey, so how do I fucking be a vampire? Like I've killed everybody.

418
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:56,260
It's time to end this. I'm just gonna try to practice singing. Come on, practice singing.

419
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:03,019
It is the tail end. Yeah, you finally get it. This is where I got sick of doing this for so long.

420
00:56:03,019 --> 00:56:07,820
It was like, oh, I killed everybody. Uh, I like ran people up with cars and I shot like five people.

421
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:21,750
Uh, I guess I'm like bored. I guess I'll just stab the character in the stomach now.

422
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:27,449
What am I doing? Are we going on an adventure? There's somebody left. What the fuck am I talking

423
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:36,469
about by a retail store? I thought I was going to get my head ran over. It's time for gardening.

424
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:45,320
Club gatherers can only be held at residents owned by garden gnomes members. I don't think

425
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,519
I'm sleeping. I'm now, you know how we feel most strange as a cube. This is how you guys feel a lot

426
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,019
of time. Huh? I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is he doing right now? I'm like, what's what?

427
00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:01,219
What the I'm sitting here going like, what is he doing? Why is he, why is he doing this right now?

428
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:07,079
Now I understand. I get it. I am retroactively annoyed with the way that I am playing the game.

429
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:11,780
Fast forward. I'm just like, come on, dude, let's fucking hurry up. It's gonna take a long time.

430
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,820
He's got five people. That's something done for God's sake. No, no, I get it. What's with the

431
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:26,199
Xbox? Oh, that's the alien still bleeding out. No, he's still, see, is it, is it like a I

432
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:33,480
misinterpreted something? I can't believe it though. I'm dead. No, the no Nightwing shirt.

433
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:44,199
No, not a bad analogy. I tried to get a picture. I couldn't get it. Game over. Or is it the last

434
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:48,119
Sim in this household has died, but you can create more Sims choosing the existing household to play.

435
00:57:48,920 --> 00:58:02,730
No, don't save in managed world. Exit the main menu. You got a game over in the Sims.

436
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:10,630
Okay, manage world. Hey, look at this new stuff. So we need a 10 seconds family to move in.

437
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:24,659
You ready? I'm ready. I need a household. Uh, where are we going? Cry of fear co-op highlights

438
00:58:24,659 --> 00:59:15,159
it was. If I replay the video, I might, if I replay the video, I might break the algorithm

439
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:26,250
that's running this whole thing. If I, I might break it, I'm going to break the algorithm.

440
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:42,199
All right, we're good. Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with scare Saturdays.

441
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,639
This time on scare Saturday is going to be going through some of the co-op of cry of fear

442
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:56,300
with star. Now before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full let's play of cry

443
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:01,579
of fear. As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than

444
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:06,940
to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel. But it's about a 15 minute video condensed

445
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,940
kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of

446
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,579
the happenings we came across. And that's probably what you're going to get. Like I said, I don't

447
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:20,139
want to have a huge let's play on this channel. It's like, you know, 50 episodes long. I've gone

448
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:25,019
down that path before, as a lot of you guys know, I've done some let's plays and yeah, we're on

449
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:30,699
episode six. I'm done. But with that said, here is the video guys, not going to take up any more

450
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:35,340
time. I want to get to the content, obviously. So, uh, it's been sunny out, go outside and go

451
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:41,480
get some sunbathing because I'm about to do it right now, baby. Sunbathing. Whoa. Take your

452
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:48,519
clothes off. I cannot pick up that gun. There's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy

453
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:53,000
over there. There's a guy over here. He's like shifting around like a freak show. Don't shoot

454
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,760
him. Don't shoot him. What do you mean? Don't shoot him. This is a fricking neighborhood.

455
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:03,659
What did you do? Do I have no bullets left? That's not bad aim. I got him in two shots.

456
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:08,860
Such recoil on this gun. It's unbelievable. Help me, help me stop shooting this guy. Shoot him please.

457
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:18,699
Please. You do it. I have to change my sensitivity. I can't aim like this.

458
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:26,780
This video is almost seven years old. I'll cover you. If I die, this is all on you.

459
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,619
All right, I will cover you. Are you ready now for real? By the way, remember,

460
01:01:31,579 --> 01:01:35,980
if you were part of the pre-stream chat, hey dude, star, do like a star appearance,

461
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:41,099
like an italics appearance. I have a gun too, but this is insanely rare. But number one,

462
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:49,289
this is a YouTube video. YouTube fucking video, which is 3.4% chance and a star inclusion,

463
01:01:50,489 --> 01:02:01,639
which is like an extra like 0.2% chance. I do see it. Is it dead? I don't have any bolts

464
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:06,889
left by the way. Yeah, that's kind of happening. We should, I think in our inventory, we have a

465
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:13,210
nightstick. I don't know how to equip these into slots. Stars in 30% of your videos. Yeah,

466
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:20,489
but we have to hit a video and it has to be a star video. So it's 3.4% chance to have a video

467
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:26,389
even play. And then 30%. What's 30% of 3.4%. Something's going to jump up. Wait,

468
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:31,369
did I just get bullets? I did. Didn't I? No, I didn't. That was you reloading. I think

469
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:40,619
1.2, 1.1, 1.25. This is fucking rare. Get out of here.

470
01:02:40,619 --> 01:03:02,730
What? Game over. Game over. I was so scared. Good idea. I heard somebody. Did that guy throw a

471
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:11,019
brick at you? I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick. I don't think I can take another

472
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:16,119
two minutes of this. Where is he? Oh, he's right there. Okay. I have two more videos for the rest

473
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:23,659
of the night. Get out of here. Go back to Ikea. Who thought this was scary? Go back to Jordan's

474
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:31,030
furniture, you piece of crap. That was kind of fun. The upside down flying mattress, man.

475
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,909
That was pretty funny. There's more of them. What do you mean there's more? Where are they?

476
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:44,139
Oh my God. They're like a flock of crows. It's actually a murder of crows. I remember that

477
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:48,780
comment in the YouTube comments. Jeremy, it's a murder of crows, you idiot. You guys haven't

478
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:55,980
changed in 10 years. He's still sitting there all mattressy. Something else, something else,

479
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:07,860
something else I heard. By the way, 10 years have almost gone by. That guy might be a pain in the

480
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,579
ass later. Well, we got to go in this way. I think there's a person in this house as well.

481
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:24,179
10 years. 10 fucking years. We could be brothers. Oh my God. Oh my God. Is she dead? That was my

482
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:29,980
girlfriend, Jerma. What the hell is that? What is that thing from like the island of Dr. Moreau?

483
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:36,059
No, that's from XCOM. We made a lot of references back in the day. No, that's the thing from the

484
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,980
island of Dr. Moreau. Moreau, not Munroe. The thing with, who's the fat actor? I'm scared. I

485
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:48,219
can't like think. What do you mean don't know who the fat actor is? You don't know who? What's this

486
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:55,530
box over here? That's not a bad analogy. That's pretty good. We're moving.

487
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:59,340
Nope, that'd be too easy. We got two of our voices been checked off.

488
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:06,840
None of these. This is tearless.

489
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:16,739
Guys, I think that's going to be it. Wait. I'm sorry we had so many problems today.

490
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:25,449
It was really bad today. What was? It wasn't even bad in the sense of,

491
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:32,070
it wasn't even dropping frames. It was just dropping everything. The whole thing would

492
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:40,889
just turn off. That sucks. Sorry about that. I think that's like four or five VODs.

493
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:50,469
Not much I can do. I knew they were doing maintenance. They were doing something. They

494
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:55,590
were upgrading. Oh god, this is going to get close, man. The node or something. This is going to get

495
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:00,789
fucking close. Right on time. Give me a break. Maybe they either fucked something up or maybe

496
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:05,989
it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it because the internet here was

497
01:06:05,989 --> 01:06:11,750
turned off for like eight hours or so. Six hours or so I think. What's wrong with this list? You

498
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:22,599
got a problem with this list? Why is GameCube in B tier? Why is the switch so high? Because

499
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:30,360
for the longest time, and I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years, I've been searching and hoping

500
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,480
for an entertainment device that you can use in the bathroom and take a shit when you go

501
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:44,230
to the bathroom for 40 minutes. He's so right. I used to bring my computer into the bathroom

502
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:48,710
and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom and sit there. He's so right. God,

503
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:56,519
imagine being this correct about something. Why is the switch so high? Give me a break.

504
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:04,619
It was bad. I used to sit, I used to bring my computer into the bathroom, set it up on like

505
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:12,519
a stand-up pop-up table, and then plug everything in and sit on the toilet. Now, shit joke is not

506
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:18,920
on here guys. And even after I was done, I didn't, because what a pain in the ass that was to get it

507
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:28,199
all in there. So my legs, my legs would start to tingle. I would sit there for an extra like

508
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:34,780
25 minutes and I would have to like, I would be getting like tingly legs. This is true. This is

509
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:39,130
real. This is not a joke. I was sitting there for too long and that's what maybe had to get up.

510
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:49,139
This is, that's not, this is not a lie. This is what, this is actually real life for me when I was

511
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:55,349
like 14, 15, 16. I think I remember my mother at the time fighting this and eventually just being like...

512
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:03,219
VaudeGerma is funnier than liveGerma. VaudeGerma is Germa. If you're gonna do it, if you're gonna do that,

513
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:08,980
this is me talking. This is like four months ago. That's me. That's me talking to you. What do you

514
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:11,780
bring, why are you doing all that? Why are you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom? It's

515
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,899
like, uh, because I wanted, I just, I'm like working. I don't know, I was an idiot.

516
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,649
No, no, don't, I'm gonna turn off. I'm gonna turn off. Listen to me before I go, before I turn off.

517
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:26,810
I want to do the bits, but it's gonna be fucked up. Hold on. All right, long story short,

518
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:32,329
I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep, and keep my hands close

519
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:38,010
and not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over. Okay,

520
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:41,609
done. This is for real. My internet's gonna turn off. So let's try to get some of these bits done

521
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:56,470
before we get shut off. Done. Let's get the, no, not BRB. I will see you guys later. The next time

522
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,869
you're gonna see me. Stream's not actually over. This is like we're watching something on a certain,

523
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:07,590
that's gonna be our stream. So you will see me after this weekend. I'll be back on, what's today?

524
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:20,520
What day is it? I will be back on Sunday. Oh my fucking god. So it is, right now it is Thursday.

525
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:28,779
I'll be back on Sunday. It flashed. There's a couple of things I want to try to get started.

526
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:33,819
I want to try to do a few things on. All right, what are you looking for here? Remember, remember,

527
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:37,739
this is. I want to try to set up. This is for 500 community. So I'm gonna work on that. 500. We can

528
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:43,260
get it like that. Not 100. A good announcement I can make next week to set that all up. If you don't

529
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,420
know what I'm talking about. Does it not count? You'll know very soon. It was accidental. I also

530
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:54,619
am obviously gonna work on the other stream too. So I will see you guys on Sunday. I'll see it. No,

531
01:09:54,619 --> 01:09:59,020
this is not, this is fake. But for now, let me see, let me try to get through these bits before the

532
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,180
internet turns off. And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs. Remember, not real.

533
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:08,460
It's kind of out of my control at this point, but I'm gonna try. It doesn't count. It's not rapid fire

534
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:15,180
these. Which usually means I'm gonna do it much slower than normal. All right, press one if it

535
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:25,399
counts too. If it doesn't count right now. I hope not. Let me actually hold on. But thank you for

536
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:30,739
joining me. It was a lot of fun. That doesn't count. Kind of a long one. I did a lot of twos.

537
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:34,899
Playing with Star was a lot of fun. I've seen a lot of twos. Star again? Mentioned. Jesus Christ.

538
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:45,260
That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't count. The majority is spoken. Raid Vinny. Yeah,

539
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,699
I'll raid Vinny after this. Raid Vinny after this, by the way. That sounds about right. We're gonna

540
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:55,369
raid Vinny. All right, so let's go down. 14 seconds. Let's go. Today, I want to see where this

541
01:10:55,369 --> 01:11:00,489
cuts off because the stream turned on and turned off like five times. Let me make sure this is

542
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,689
correct. Do you remember back in October, November of last year? It was every fucking day. It was

543
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:13,460
horrendous. Here we go. Here we go. That's my vote for Cheez-It. Let's see. Best snack. Cheez-It.

544
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:23,000
Another one. Cheez-Nip. Let's see. Well, let the people decide. Wait, I'm doing a vote for

545
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,420
Cheez-It or Cheez-Nip. Put a filter on your voice so we can determine who's talking. I hope they

546
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,859
come up with like a Charlie Cheez-Nip. That would make me fucking laugh my ass off. All right, let's

547
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:36,220
go. Here comes the poll. All right, I'll put a filter on so you know who's talking. Please vote

548
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:42,060
on this poll if you'd like. Okay, okay. The lower one is me. The lower one is me. The one that's

549
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:52,020
currently live is me. And introducing first, he doesn't need an introduction. Captain Chi,

550
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:56,949
he's currently, he's wearing the best cheese flavored snack belt.

551
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:02,300
That is a real belt. He is the champion of all cheese snacks.

552
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:17,979
And don't worry. Don't worry. Ladies and gentlemen, it's not like Jerma gave Captain Cheez-It like 99

553
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:24,220
in all stats and Captain Cheez-Nip like 30. There's no reverb. He deserves it. Where's the echo?

554
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:32,840
Cheez-Nips are fucking gross. And you also be ashamed if you think Cheez-Nips are better than

555
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:41,529
Cheez-It. There's no echo. And introducing next, his opponent. His opponent coming into the ring

556
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:48,409
right now. A disgusting human being. Trying to kill the American people by the way. Turn off the

557
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:56,939
lights. Here they go. Why is there so much reverb? What the fuck is happening? I'm not,

558
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:01,260
I don't understand. What's he holding in his hand there? What is that? I know what that is.

559
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:08,489
I know what that is. That's the third ingredient in Cheez-Nips. It's poison. I knew it. I probably

560
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:13,609
shouldn't have said that. He's poisoning his body. He's getting his ingredients all ready to go.

561
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:16,649
I should never have said this. This is like bad. He's fucking poisoning himself.

562
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:26,489
Just like all the Cheez-Nips. Disgusting. This is a joke. Charlie Chee at Cheez-Nips. That's not an

563
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:33,779
ad. That's me talking about how much this thing sucks. That's not an ad. I don't want to even be

564
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:42,460
in the arena right now. Lawsuit incoming. There it is. Okay, let's get that off the screen.

565
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:51,689
Hey, by the way, this is like this slander campaign brought to you by. Is it still there?

566
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:55,689
Ring that bell. This is an extreme rules. Who has the best cheese flavored snack? Charlie Cheez-Nips.

567
01:13:56,329 --> 01:14:00,250
Right off the bat with the scoop slam on. This is going to be fucking hard to remember these names.

568
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:06,409
This should not be. I'm going to call them Cheez-Nips or Cheez-Nips. This is weird. Hello?

569
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:10,489
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

570
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:14,409
Ooh, a low blow there. Remember, this is an extreme rules match. Hello? Hello?

571
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:18,010
Anything goes and then you can go to the outside like Charlie Cheez-It. There we go.

572
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:23,529
It's not his name. Just say Cheez-It. Cheez-It. Now you know who's the German.

573
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:29,859
Scoops him down. The regular one. My favorite snack is Cheez-It, especially the Tabasco ones.

574
01:14:29,859 --> 01:14:34,100
They're fucking unbelievably delicious. You should buy as much as you can possibly

575
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:39,380
fit in your house. You've got a spare bedroom? Fill it with Cheez-It. How's that? This should

576
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,020
be bad. You've got a bathroom you don't use very much? I'm a little bit lower. There you go.

577
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,539
So now you can tell who the real German is. You buy it in the Cheez-It box,

578
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:49,460
put it in the Cheez-It box. There you go. This is a real hoist turmoil.

579
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,539
No, he almost slipped there for a second. Cheez-It's going to be a little greasy.

580
01:14:53,539 --> 01:14:58,739
They can be a little greasy. Cheez-Nips aren't as greasy. I will agree. Wait a minute. He gets

581
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:03,939
caught by Mr. Cheez-Nose and throws him down to the ground. Now he's going to go on the top rope.

582
01:15:04,659 --> 01:15:07,939
Second rope. We all know if you go on the second rope you're a fucking wuss.

583
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,020
And that's what he's doing. Exactly what he's doing. You go on the second rope, you're a wuss.

584
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:17,609
Wow. Lame. Why does this sound so fucked up? That was fucking lame. It's all right though.

585
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:22,810
Totally Cheez-It is going to be able to get up. Okay. Why does this sound so fucked up?

586
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:29,289
The yellow guy just did a elbow drop onto the orange guy. Is it better? Orange guy,

587
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:32,090
get him. Orange guy got him by the back. Now drops him into the nose.

588
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:35,770
No, this is so weird. His big fucking ugly Cheez-It nose. Cheez-Nips nose.

589
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:40,680
Nice miss by the way, orange guy. What about that?

590
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,039
Oh, he gets reversed there. And these are extreme rules. Go get something. Thank you.

591
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,399
God, I'm talking all this shit and he's going underneath the ring finally for the first time.

592
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:58,520
Is that better? No. He picked up a Kendo stick. No, that's a Cheez-Stick. What am I talking about?

593
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,840
He picked up a giant Cheez-Stick, but he gets reversed. Remember, these are all cheese based

594
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,869
rules. That is a sharp cheddar cheese stick. Just turn it off. Gets reversed. Now he's going to get

595
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:13,430
thrown over it and go for the steps. Well, here we go. We get 25 seconds left before.

596
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:19,539
I'm just, I'm trying to differentiate the voices to make it so you can tell who's talking.

597
01:16:19,539 --> 01:16:23,539
Get him on the table. Get him on the table. What about this? What are you doing? Is this better?

598
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:28,760
Everybody stood up. It was perfect. Holy shit. Captain Cheez-It is now on the top

599
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:42,060
ropes all the way to the outside. Here comes a no. No. Let's go. He just got a double kill.

600
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:51,239
Oblivion. Now this guy's dead. Why are you doing this to me, game? Stop it. Oh, I gotta turn. I,

601
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:58,149
I just can't. Something I never fucking finished. Didn't even try. That's a glitch. I told you. I'm

602
01:16:58,149 --> 01:17:05,270
just julianning fucking french fries. That's a glitch. Okay. Let's put it on there.

603
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:15,699
Oh, what are we getting close to? That's not a terrible analogy. That's a good one.

604
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:24,420
Julianning french fries. That's fucking smart and funny and interesting and hilarious. Finally.

605
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:35,380
All right. Mouth music. No music. No terrible aim. I can't have this happen. Actually hurting

606
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:44,100
people. No fall jokes. Hope not. Stop it. Yeah, this is a glitch. This is all fucked up.

607
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:49,159
That didn't help. Yeah, no, this is, there's a, it belongs on here. You're right. Hey, stop that.

608
01:17:49,960 --> 01:18:02,069
Okay, this is wicked fucked up. No, why do we have to, why is there to be at this part?

609
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:12,520
No, technical difficulties is something wrong with the stream or a, this is not ignoring the

610
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:18,119
game's story. This is me fighting. What? I'm fighting like in a fucking dungeon. At least I

611
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:23,159
dungeon. No, I can't. I'll throw up. I'm seriously going to fucking get sick if I do that.

612
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:29,180
Is that a technique? I mean, I mean, it kind of, no, it's not. That's me doing that intentional.

613
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,859
Chainmail greaves. It's a shitty joke. It's not technical difficulties. I wish I could compare.

614
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:41,140
I think these are better than what I have. Guard helmet. I think is a little bit better.

615
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:54,229
Chainmail greaves. No, they're not iron greaves. Guard helmets. One. I think the other one is one

616
01:18:54,229 --> 01:19:03,930
as well. I forgot. That's what he looked like for 45. I do. I did a face cam fucking yesterday.

617
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:24,460
How close are we? I got to take a look at this. You can't do 720. I think 360 might be the max.

618
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:29,590
Don't make any impressions. Yeah. Don't remember. We can go down here too.

619
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:33,189
No nightwing shirt. No, I don't think we're going to see the star wars shirt.

620
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:43,500
Breaking a game is not on the list. 360 FOV. There it is. Now if you're wondering why

621
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:50,039
you're probably curious as to saying, hey, Jerma, why have you not finished Oblivion?

622
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:55,859
Why wouldn't you go back to play Oblivion? Because I did all this shit and then the game

623
01:19:55,859 --> 01:20:08,409
became not interesting anymore. FOV 10. This is just magnifying glass. You ignored the story.

624
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:18,539
No, I did, but not right now. Oblivion is like a 450 hour long game. This is not a story.

625
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:28,380
This does not mean ignoring the story. This is me like doing one of the quests.

626
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:33,260
Why would I? I turned it down. It's a side quest. Nothing else in here.

627
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:39,260
Plates, sleeping quarters. I'm so glad I haven't mentioned eating or ass or pissing.

628
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,779
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Why? Hey, wait a minute. Nothing up here at all.

629
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:50,920
You realize that all your life you've been coasting along as if you were in a dream,

630
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,920
suddenly facing the trials of last few days, you've come alive. Is that, wait, hold on,

631
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:02,680
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, is that strange noise or is that music? Is that music? No, it's not.

632
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:13,340
I mean, it is. It's fucking music. Athletic strength. That's a, no, that's a strange noise.

633
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:28,600
How much fatigue you have. That's not me going like. That's like. That's a weird noise. Yeah.

634
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,159
Don't get mad at that. Basket case. I said level up.

635
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:41,659
Well, let's get going. I'm like getting it on my phone. I've just grabbed it as I failed the tutorial.

636
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:53,899
He's going. Are they biting people? Why would you run towards the animal? All right. I get it.

637
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:59,699
I understand the gist of the game. Is there a rewind? Is there a rewind button? That's not a

638
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:16,119
laughing fit. Is this how giraffes sleep? That's fucking crazy. What? Don't you get a stiff neck?

639
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,659
Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I understand how this works. That's not a laughing fit.

640
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:32,539
That was not a laughing fit. That was not a laughing fit. How do I pick you up? That was not.

641
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:39,079
How do I pick you up? That is like where I can't stop. Emergency capture. Oh shit. How do you.

642
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:46,460
Too much. Too many bits. This is disabled by the tutorial. No laughing fit is like I can't even like

643
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:53,460
talk or breathe. It's all you hear for like 10 straight seconds. So how do I get them back?

644
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:04,729
Where are they? There's a lot of potential for. Look I didn't mean to delete this. I'm trying

645
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:09,210
to delete plants because it's like. They don't like the shrubs in there. Get rid of them. They

646
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:13,960
hate it. What is it the sims? When you have a painting in the room that the sim doesn't like

647
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:24,939
they're like fun goes to zero. There's an undo at the bottom. We already have a bad bad impression

648
01:23:24,939 --> 01:23:33,909
of who? Impression of who? Of what are you talking about? How do I get the animals back in?

649
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:44,409
Or I. All right I gotta pee. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. No no where are you going?

650
01:23:44,409 --> 01:24:01,779
Where are you going? How do I get these animals back in here? He's just walking around. All right

651
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:16,710
how do I delete this part? Here come here. Just let them walk around. Let them roam. No I need to

652
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:23,350
do the second tutorial. Okay let's do this. Come here. This is this is temporary. I didn't want to

653
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:35,260
fuck this whole thing up but I have to. Get rid of this shit. How do I delete this road?

654
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,550
Call the keeper. I can't. Can I not even. I don't think I can do that.

655
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:49,560
Call vet because look I can't. I can't like emergency capture. Is vet gonna go over here?

656
01:24:49,560 --> 01:25:02,979
What about this? Call the vet. They'll walk back in when I'm hungry. It's going to the bathroom.

657
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:13,750
They're all trying to leave. There's a line. There's a line out the door to leave.

658
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:33,270
He can't even escape. What the hell was that? What you got? Sniper rifle? What the fuck?

659
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:39,689
Just keep keep. Get him. Get him. I didn't want it to go to like to shit.

660
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,600
Oh no.

661
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:59,300
He can just step over this. He can step over this. It's like a baby game. Are you serious?

662
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:07,960
All right what'd I miss? What'd I miss? What'd I miss? What did I miss? Just because I deleted

663
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,659
this that was. Did I miss anything? The vet's on duty. What'd I miss? What habitat's invalid?

664
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:24,699
What's wrong with this? Wait where are you going? Laughing fit? Wait is this the part with the

665
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:34,220
gorilla? If this is the gorilla part. Did I buy something? Hold on a minute. No no. That's lying.

666
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:56,359
Okay okay. All right yeah I see I see. How about a brick wall? All right are we still good?

667
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:04,859
Watch the clip. It's funny. Well I I can't. This is an invalid. Well how did it become invalid?

668
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:09,260
I can't like watch your clip and watch. I gotta pay attention to the video. How did I fuck this

669
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:27,300
up? I don't understand what's wrong with this. You have 158 seconds. Hold on. Where is it? How

670
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:39,750
many are in here? All right what I what is wrong with this gate? Marked as not. No no where are

671
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:52,020
you going? Where are you going? How did I screw it up? That's pretty funny. Is this part here

672
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:59,979
that's a problem? Oh my god Jerma fucking just go do something. The fence was fucked up though.

673
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:05,140
How did I fuck up the tutorial? Well it's very easy because I was selecting I was selecting the

674
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:10,420
bushes over here and it was selecting this fucking building and I deleted the building when I was

675
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:15,539
selecting the bushes here. I did it like 10 times. You sure you don't want to pick up this building

676
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:21,050
and delete it? I mean look I'm moving on to the next tutorial. Moulding should have been a free

677
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:26,180
space. I know what I'm doing. Seriously. I don't know why it's over here. It should have been a

678
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:30,260
free space. I soft-locked myself somebody said. Why were they selecting the bushes? Because they don't

679
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:37,689
look. That's not bad. They don't like bushes. They fucking hate them and it was like there's something

680
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:45,880
wrong with their habitat. They don't like the bushes. No get 60 seconds. Look see well you know

681
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:50,600
they really really don't like those trees. They don't like the bushes either. Oh I think I feel

682
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:56,010
an Alex Jones coming on. Is he gonna do it? So I have to go through and get rid of these

683
01:28:56,010 --> 01:29:05,340
or they're gonna hate their environment. Oh that's close. I know how to play. I'm done. We're gonna

684
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:18,180
play. That shit was real close. All these plants need to be deleted. He has to mention Joe Rogan for

685
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:28,949
it to be an Alex Jones impression. Wait what? That's so true. That is unbelievably accurate.

686
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:37,060
Well they hate everything in here. 10 seconds. Okay well in Richmond we need food in here.

687
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:51,619
Here we go. It's the middle guy. It's the middle one. With the pursuit of justice. Yeah here comes

688
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:59,449
the straw pole. Second from the left. All right here comes the straw pole. Hold on. I have no idea.

689
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:05,100
We're about to identify the fucking murderer. I'm just gonna do one two three four five.

690
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:21,289
One two three four five. Who is it? Let me give me some help here guys. Ah too bad I didn't have

691
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:29,239
does a pole. That would have been really really easy. One two three four five. Does a pole would

692
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:37,100
have been instant. It looks like three is winning. Oh wow. Almost as tall as suspect number one.

693
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:43,829
Actually guys sorry to say this but like I'm like up here. I'm like right there. You motherfuckers.

694
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:51,750
I'm taller than all these guys. So sorry. You're wrong. This is five six. These guys roll wide.

695
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:56,069
Five six to six feet right here. That's not that's not doesn't make any.

696
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:02,680
All right it's it's the middle guy. The middle guy is winning by a huge amount. Thank you for

697
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:08,760
voting. That's it's a closing poll. Middle guy. By the way why do I have to pick for her?

698
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:16,470
She's the one that witnessed the crime. I was just told about it. Why do I have to pick this?

699
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:29,079
That's the guy. I'm sure of it. Okay let me scan these people. Okay we need it. We need to go to

700
01:31:29,079 --> 01:31:34,460
legal level. We got to build the case here. Do identity. Case constructor. I know case for

701
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:53,460
identity. There he is. Case for identity. Line up. Okay see. Yep there he is. Why would he just

702
01:31:53,460 --> 01:32:00,340
scan that by the way? That doesn't seem like something that needs to be scanned. Oh level up.

703
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,060
I think you spang grew for the 10 bucks. These streams make my night no matter what don't ever

704
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:08,579

Also sticks renegade. Sticks welcome welcome to stream against it. With 10 dollars and 26 cents.

706
01:32:16,819 --> 01:32:20,899
This one is still doing it. Jiggas up the news is out. They finally found me. The renegade who

707
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:30,489
had it made retrieved for a bounty. How old is this stream? 342. Oh thanks a lot man. Thanks

708
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:38,789

709
01:32:38,789 --> 01:32:42,869

All right let's go. Good old days. All right thank god we're getting the fuck out of here.

713
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:10,279
Probably not but you know. There has to be something I can do here but there's just

714
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:13,079
absolutely nothing to do. Okay cool. Why does this exist? Of course.

715
01:33:14,539 --> 01:33:24,460
Like there's nothing here. Let's go back to the courthouse.

716
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:28,699
No wait. Well if you really think you're prepared enough go ahead.

717
01:33:29,659 --> 01:33:33,909
It says four day three. No you guys are looking for a tf2 video. Let's go. Wait I have a new

718
01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:38,869
I have a new message. An actual rumor issue. Click maps. From what I understand the hearing

719
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:42,789
will be conducted in Judge Hilton's office at 10 o'clock on Wednesday morning.

720
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:49,270
Yeah yes sir. A court reporter will be present at the time. That was a click. Shoo me away.

721
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:55,989
No no no no no. That's the last chance here. That was literally a map click. No no a click map.

722
01:33:55,989 --> 01:34:00,550
Like the the the circles on the screen. No you can't you know. We're not playing semantics.

723
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:02,149
We're not playing semantics.

724
01:34:19,449 --> 01:34:21,130
The witness tapes. Right the witness tapes.

725
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:32,840
Uh that's that's not me talking. That's not an impression. Thanks for the filler.

726
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:38,470
Thank you for the filler. I appreciate that. Let's go to the map. Where were those? What happens

727
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:44,869
after a bingo? I give 500 community subs. This is what happens. Interrogation records evidence.

728
01:34:45,510 --> 01:35:02,060
Let's get in here for the trial tomorrow. Basketball, weed eaters. Why are you extending

729
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:14,970
this shit? Where's the evidence? Uh we got the car. Scan that. Okay. I gotta stop talking. Just

730
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:19,050
got to scan all this shit aren't I? Oh of course I am. And like I'm gonna have to get the fingerprints

731
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:30,380
and shit. Oh no. No time for that. Court is about to start. Good luck counselor. Oh no oh god.

732
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:41,829
Okay okay. Case for identity. We got this. Okay we got the good old days. Never end.

733
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:49,020
And case for murder. We have like killing of a human being. How do you extend

734
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:55,640
with channel points? If you highlight a message it is premeditated. 20 000 channel points to add

735
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:11,859
30 seconds to a video. Right by the way. And I'm not supposed to be talking. None of this is right.

736
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:15,300
You just you know I'm a good talker. You get the guy on that stand and I'll be able to fucking make

737
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:25,500
it happen. Here we go. All right. I might have to use. No. I'm gonna use my second needle. The

738
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:30,380
honorable Judge Lawrence Adams presided. I'm gonna use my second needle. Uh if you trip it at five

739
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:40,170
minutes. I actually just got baited. I did. That was fucking horrible. That guilty motherfucker

740
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:48,600
right there. Baiters and gentlemen. Court is now in session. People may proceed with their case.

741
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:54,279
It's been five minutes. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Tommy Wu was a pretty worrisome

742
01:36:54,279 --> 01:37:00,359
with thoughts. All right. Where's the game glitch? Game glitch. Here's Sonic the Hedgehog.

743
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:05,640
January 24th. Walking around. You killed it. You killed it. You killed it. By the defendant

744
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:12,250
Michael Fong. You will hear in the testimony of Cinderidge Chen how the defendant came into

745
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:18,250
Hal's bar with a group of Chu Sing gang members and headed straight for Tommy Wu. You will hear

746
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:25,109
how Tommy was choked with a steel cable and dragged to the floor. The defendant is charged.

747
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:30,710
In his suit. The evidence will show he is guilty of this charge. Walking back and forth like moving

748
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:38,329
his hands around. Oh god. Damn it. I tried to use my second veto and then I... I can't wait to put

749
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:54,300
the third disc in. I only get one more after this. Did I miss that? Did I miss the entire

750
01:37:54,300 --> 01:38:02,170
rat tattoo arc of the whole stream? I had to. There was probably like a whole huge story about

751
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:14,619
the rat tattoo. There's an underwater taxi. I thought he was going over the thing.

752
01:38:21,369 --> 01:38:24,779
I wonder if this is going to get tripped. Of course it is.

753
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:38,069
All right. What's possible here? What's actually possible here? Who's in this car? Who the fuck is

754
01:38:38,069 --> 01:38:56,979
in this car? I mean, molding is done. Screaming is still on the table. Yeah. Ambulance. Impressions

755
01:38:56,979 --> 01:39:07,289
are still on the table. That's true. Use horn. That was a... That was a rumor here right now.

756
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:15,079
Not... That was a rumor here. Not in the past. What the hell is the lion pose? It's this thing.

757
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:22,119
I do... I used to do it fucking every stream. This guy's freaking me out. Bad. Big time.

758
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:29,590
Okay. Drive to the hospital. No. None of these counts because it's... No, no, no. It has to be...

759
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:41,180
No, no, no. Doesn't count. All right. Talk to Dr. Hibbert. All right. Final mission incoming.

760
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:48,819
Final? Wait. This is the last mission? Oh yeah. Jerma, you think it's the final mission?

761
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:57,960
There's six more fucking hours in this mod. What are you talking about? You think it's the final

762
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:13,449
mission? Is that... That was way too fast. Is that a bait? Here we are at our final destination.

763
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:23,300
It's just between me and you. Random object. Well, I... Did I say final or did somebody in

764
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:31,380
chat say final? That was a selfie. I know my face cam's not on. Why? There's no... Put down the rocks.

765
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:50,439
Oh, I was like, what the fuck are you guys doing? Chat said last level. Did they say that?

766
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:58,920
We're putting them down by throwing them. Fall joke is very important to not have happen.

767
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,720
TF2 video's fucking guaranteed to not happen.

768
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:13,300
Need a disguise? Purchase. Who's American clothes? Another 425 coins. Click maps is possible. Shit.

769
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:23,560
Got this. Is slowing me down. An impression incoming? 57 coins. I mean, that's... It's

770
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:27,319
possible. It's possible. I don't know, though. All right, we have to scrounge around now.

771
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:36,500
How long am I gonna do this for? We're gonna find boxes. We're gonna find sewing machines

772
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:42,739
and box over here. I don't know, until I'm fucking bored. Do a wager race.

773
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:49,640
We've seen how much of a disaster those were. I should sleep more.

774
01:41:50,520 --> 01:42:00,439
Okay, right before he loses. No, no, no. I'll give you time. Okay. So, we'll do this for...

775
01:42:01,399 --> 01:42:10,569
Uh, not a bad start. At least three or four hours. At least. So, if it's like,

776
01:42:10,569 --> 01:42:16,090
well, you know, guys, I'm gonna feel like I'm a little sick today. Right before you get a bingo?

777
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:25,880
No, no, no. It has to be at least a four-hour spring. At least. Box right here. And a B.

778
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:38,140
It took a lot longer than it should have. It's not an impression. What do you get if you win?

779
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:42,859
Uh, nothing. I've already been given so much by this community. That's the fucking good answer,

780
01:42:42,859 --> 01:42:56,890
right? 400, right? Or was it 425? But if I lose, then I'll give Twitch a percentage of the money

781
01:42:56,890 --> 01:43:04,170
for 500 of you to be subscribed. Nothing, nothing, nothing. That's a nice PR spin. Yeah.

782
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:14,010
Yeah. I'll just pay Twitch a bunch of money to sub 500 people. What about the statues?

783
01:43:15,539 --> 01:43:21,220
The killer sock. Thanks a lot for the sub. KillerSock11518. Thank you for the sub.

784
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:27,539
How about one of my cars? Is that person still subbed? How do we check?

785
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:35,050
Well, this is too bad because we got rolled a really boring shitty part of this stream.

786
01:43:43,289 --> 01:43:46,970
This is, this is crazy. So remember, I beat this whole game in one stream.

787
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:51,850
This might be the one five to 10 minute portion of this stream

788
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:54,329
or I don't sound like I'm going to fucking strangle myself.

789
01:43:56,170 --> 01:44:04,649
This is weird. This is like a weird downtime for this stream. All right. Do I actually? Very calm.

790
01:44:04,649 --> 01:44:22,300
I'm very calm and just relaxed. This is a slippery course.

791
01:44:30,729 --> 01:44:34,539
Did they block off on most of these ways to skip group?

792
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:42,539
This is so bad. I think I'm going to have to restart this. Holy shit. I suck.

793
01:44:54,439 --> 01:45:03,239
Unless I can, I don't think I can do anything. No.

794
01:45:04,039 --> 01:45:14,090
Maybe I could have like, let's go. The offices. Resident Evil 2 remake. Which one? Up here.

795
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:18,939
Oh, by the way, best game that came out last year. Well, what's even hidden up there?

796
01:45:18,939 --> 01:45:24,100
Cause he talking about that. That's quite, that's a journey for me to go on right now. Hold on.

797
01:45:24,739 --> 01:45:34,500
If I go up from here, I'm going to get myself fucking killed. We might get a scream. It's

798
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:40,199
possible. This is the, this is the one point where it could happen. Thrip it. There it is.

799
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:46,630
You might get your scream. So I'm just going to try. I'm going to go up the stairs from here

800
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:59,800
and we'll go to the star's office. You got five minutes for a scream to happen here.

801
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:05,979
Star's office. You will posing webcams. No, there's already a webcam on the stream. You

802
01:46:05,979 --> 01:46:17,449
don't need me. If you get screamed, then you're looking for a look at me, a laughing fit,

803
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:26,090
or ignoring the game's whole story. Hold on a second. No, I can't go to the showers. There

804
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:38,060
are lickers all over the place here. I've got to walk through here and then through the door.

805
01:46:38,060 --> 01:47:00,710
Now you do. I know there's at least one up here. I've shot this thing 10 times.

806
01:47:03,609 --> 01:47:34,520
Straight and it's on the left. All right. So where was that? It was somebody's desk with

807
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:42,659
coffee on it. Let me take a look. There's a stereo player and then a phone with some

808
01:47:42,659 --> 01:48:08,140
pens. Let me put the phone with some pens on it. Okay, right here. Wooden box. A slightly heavy

809
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:19,880
wooden box. All right. That's all I got. A piece of wood. Come on, I can open this. Red dot sight

810
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,399
for the lightning hawk. A custom part for the lightning hawk that allows for lightning fast

811
01:48:23,479 --> 01:48:38,170
aiming. All right. Pretty cool. Oh, so then from that's sick. But the other one is

812
01:48:39,289 --> 01:48:52,409
with the boom box. I got to get back out to the main hall. And then first floor, it was like down

813
01:48:52,409 --> 01:49:07,579
here, right? East office or press room. What did I just got more film? Oh, what kind of wild goose

814
01:49:07,579 --> 01:49:16,600
chase is this putting me on? This is like a treasure hunt. I get the USB to go on the computer.

815
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:27,829
I've got to go check the press room. I got to watch out for the liquor. All right. So I got

816
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:45,930
back through back into the dark room or maybe not. Yeah. So I got to go back to get to the main hall

817
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:52,760
again. It's going to keep searching the desk. What there's like hidden prompts everywhere.

818
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:57,880
Why do we get every single part of the screen is so boring? I'm not doing anything. I'm just like,

819
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:04,279
how long is this board? We get it's eight hours for me to beat this game. And I can't

820
01:50:04,279 --> 01:50:11,640
fucking even shoot a guy. I'm going to do the same thing. It's going to go down from here

821
01:50:12,569 --> 01:50:16,890
and we're going to develop this film. So we just have to slowly make our way away from the liquor

822
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:33,050
through the shower. Wrong way. I'm just going, I'm going just back down to the

823
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:40,340
hurry. Kiss him. USB USB. I already got the lightning. Forgot that. What do you mean?

824
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:48,420
I'm going down. What are you guys talking about? I already did it. Yeah. I know I had, I have it.

825
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:53,140
And then I'm going to put that in the secret room downstairs. No, I know. I know what's going on.

826
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:08,010
10 seconds for a scream. So then let's just go. No. Fuck it. Run out of time here. It's gone.

827
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:22,789
Mafia three. So brutal. Can we get in this car? I pushed his face into the ground from standing.

828
01:51:22,789 --> 01:51:42,310
Oh no. Witness. Holy shit. Running out of time. Made it to the bar. All right. Let's go. Why? It's

829
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:52,859
like GTA. Well, how come it's not working? I thought it was going to like just instantly go

830
01:51:52,859 --> 01:52:02,729
to the mission. If you don't play mafia, by the way, this is probably here.

831
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:13,369
Welcome home, son. Early. Yeah, it's an early stream. I'll be better once I get some of that

832
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:25,670
shine in me. Let's make a toast. I just drove over like four people.

833
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:37,109
He was joining the military. That's not confirmed yet. That's not confirmed yet. It's

834
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:41,750
gone out. Oatwells. Oatwheels. Thanks for two months, dude. Go out and make his mom.

835
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:54,550
And that's precisely what he did. I'm so, so proud of you. Oh, cut scene. Ain't seen one of

836
01:52:54,550 --> 01:53:05,800
those in a while. Oh, that's such an ignoring cut scene. That's so my god. Oh, cut scene.

837
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,880
The cut scene started like three minutes ago. Wow. Holy shit, dude. That was unbelievable. The

838
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:17,239
cut scene started like two minutes ago. I really appreciate that. God damn it. Whatever.

839
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:30,010
It's hard to explain what it's like coming home. That was so bad. I didn't even know the cut scene

840
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:34,970
started. Holy shit. What's the consensus of this game? What's like the reviews on it?

841
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:44,390
Like six. You didn't know that before you started streaming it? Why? You knew it wasn't in the

842
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:50,619
schedule. You knew it was a six before you started streaming it. You were just concerned

843
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:56,859
that other people might not have liked it. It sucks. That doesn't really. That doesn't really.

844
01:53:56,859 --> 01:54:05,609
Yeah, you knew that. Bad, bad, very bad, really. Story is good for the gameplays, man.

845
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:17,350
It feels pretty fun so far. Feels pretty, feels, you hear that? Do you hear that?

846
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:24,710
Feels, feels pretty fun. Why? I gotta work on that. I gotta work on that. I gotta work on that.

847
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:32,569
Feels pretty good. Is this any good? Is this any good? Is this any? I gotta work on that. Bad port.

848
01:54:32,569 --> 01:54:47,369
Liar voice. I gotta work on that. I'm glad we're doing this. Bad aim could happen here.

849
01:54:49,060 --> 01:55:07,140
I need like a meditation video. I need to do a meditation. Guided meditation. Hold on.

850
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:14,550
Tripped it. What do we got here? Guided meditation? I have to do this, guys. I'm sorry.

851
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:27,340
I'm like, I'm all fired up. Damn it, not a Star Wars shirt. I thought it was a Star Wars shirt.

852
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:36,649
It was possible. What the fuck even, what happens here? It's supposed to be instructions. What

853
01:55:36,649 --> 01:55:43,430
happens here? Thank you for being here, dear soul. I'm Kenneth, and from my heart I will...

854
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:48,470
Is this the cheers for you, guy? This is the cheers to you, guy? I think this is the cheers to you.

855
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:51,960
...make yourself as comfortable as you can right this moment.

856
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,920
You think it's sweaty? No, I'm not. We gotta get an armpit shot. We gotta get a shot of the

857
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:03,779
underarm. If there's sweat under the underarm, sure. Observing the words I share with you like

858
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:11,060
a soft breeze on a summer night. Noticing that whatever it is that you notice,

859
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:20,310
your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper within.

860
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:24,550
How would somebody be able to sleep to this? Could you imagine... All right, seriously,

861
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:32,069
wait a second. Wait. Can you imagine if you were trying to go to sleep, okay? You lay down and

862
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:35,189
you're like, man, I really wish I had something to help me go to sleep. And I'm like, I only help

863
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:41,779
you there. And I go right up to your fucking ear. And I'm like, very soon you'll be sleeping.

864
01:56:42,939 --> 01:56:48,939
And just to let you know, it's so relaxing in this room. And very soon you'll be going to bed,

865
01:56:49,899 --> 01:56:54,460
just like the breeze of a sunny summer Monday morning. That's not an impression. That's the way

866
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:58,939
that you'll see the world. You're gonna be like, what are you doing to me? Like, I'm trying to

867
01:56:58,939 --> 01:57:04,699
sleep. I need complete silence and I need nobody talking and I don't want any lights on. That's

868
01:57:04,699 --> 01:57:09,699
not an impression. All right, let's see if we can... Now I'm even more fucking on edge than I was

869
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:14,260
before. It didn't help at all. No, that's not an impression. It's not an impression of that guy.

870
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:24,390
That's me doing, me doing that video. No, it's not an impression. Not an impression. No, it's not.

871
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:33,539
Where is my meditation? I just had it. Where is it? It's on a different window. What the fuck

872
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:36,260
is this window? Why is it down here? It was an impression of that fucking guy. Of course it was.

873
01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:44,520
Help me. Come on. No TF2 video and we're good. And I want no Nightwing shirt, no TF2 videos.

874
01:57:58,579 --> 01:58:02,819
Color in the molding box. Yeah, okay. We might as well just fucking color this in.

875
01:58:04,569 --> 01:58:10,149
This is the free space. You know, just fucking write it on there.

876
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:25,479
Turn this shit off. Stubborn. Just seriously write it down. Let me fucking relax.

877
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:31,180
Because I drank a Coke that's an ad. That guy just made me so fucking angry.

878
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:53,449
I drank a Coke on camera and it's an ad. What? I can't drink a Coke on camera? All right,

879
01:58:53,449 --> 01:58:56,489
I need to actually go over this. Tristan found him like this. He must have been taken here.

880
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,460
Found cut marks around his wrists and ankles. Death by strangulation. TF2 video.

881
01:59:02,819 --> 01:59:08,659
Fall joke is bad. A real rumor moment is bad too. Yeah, seems like a killer may have robbed him

882
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:16,470
on like previous victories. Uh, not victories. Couldn't find the kids. How's this going on?

883
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:24,310
Who knows? Might have been someone else. Oh, I forgot about this. I did this shit, right? I

884
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:32,229
recorded myself for five minutes before stream. I'm on. I'm off. Right. I forgot about that.

885
01:59:32,229 --> 01:59:35,909
I did a full like five to ten minutes of recorded base cam before the stream turned on.

886
01:59:35,909 --> 01:59:39,029
I'm gonna head back to the office. And it was voted one of the worst jokes of the year, right?

887
01:59:39,029 --> 01:59:43,750
Two years ago? This is ruining the game for me. I'm too angry. I'm just too hard. Oh,

888
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:48,869
it's gonna get so much worse. I'll let you know if we find anything else. All right.

889
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:52,390
Yeah, that was like worst joke that took. Yeah, I remember that. That was two years ago.

890
01:59:53,029 --> 01:59:57,590
Why does that guy have that move? Why does that guy die? Why does that guy die in one hit?

891
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:02,550
Jerma mocking him getting mad at a video game should have been on here.

892
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:11,029
The same people who make this game. Like Jeremy getting angry at a game is one thing,

893
02:00:11,029 --> 02:00:14,869
but then he mocks how mad he was and how embarrassed he is that he got that angry in

894
02:00:14,869 --> 02:00:22,359
the first place. That could have been a square. Bad aim incoming. We have 50 seconds to see it.

895
02:00:23,079 --> 02:00:27,510
Hey guys, just got the masks we ordered. Pretty cool, eh?

896
02:00:31,539 --> 02:00:38,180
They're all chickens. Well, how do they feel? You like them? No gameplay at all yet, guys. Zero.

897
02:00:39,619 --> 02:00:40,500
Zero gameplay.

898
02:00:40,500 --> 02:01:35,319
I'll get it. What's next? L.A. Noire part three. I gave up on this game by the way.

899
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:48,760
I got like three or four streams into this and then somebody told me, dude,

900
02:01:48,760 --> 02:02:02,569
you got like another 30 or 40 hours. And I was like, oh, okay. That's fun. Matches.

901
02:02:02,569 --> 02:02:10,569
Matches are never anything. Ever. It's never matches. That's a one guy moment? How?

902
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:15,210
What do you mean that was a one guy moment? What are you talking about? How?

903
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:26,010
I still feel these seeds in my mouth. I'm going to have to go throw up.

904
02:02:26,409 --> 02:02:35,180
No. One guy moment. It happened. You said it did. It didn't happen in the video. No.

905
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:51,270
Not at this part. No. It's there in my teeth. It's bad. I can't wait until we get the 1%

906
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:55,750
chance for Otto's Great Adventure 2 and I've used my third veto over the night to get rid of it.

907
02:02:58,359 --> 02:03:07,420
Somebody did the scene plus the blood stains. No way is this coincidence.

908
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:16,470
Okay. Shoo on head. I better put this on my head or chat will think it's pre-recorded.

909
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:19,430
That was good. That was good. Where's like the good fucking joke square?

910
02:03:20,069 --> 02:03:35,180
Where's the good joke square? Cause that was a good one. We kept the area pristine for you boys.

911
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:41,579
That's too rare to have it be a square. Boston accent was going to be one too. In

912
02:03:41,579 --> 02:03:43,819
pre-stream we were trying to talk about what should be here.

913
02:03:43,819 --> 02:03:54,329
Boston accent was a square and I got rid of it last second. God damn it.

914
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:10,340
15 seconds. Five house keys strung up like bait. There is 3,200 hours of footage.

915
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:21,909
Where will we? Oh, nevermind. I said five seconds. I said five seconds remain. Like what?

916
02:04:21,909 --> 02:04:25,989
I can't say that you get the timer on the screen. I'm reacting to the same timer that you have on

917
02:04:25,989 --> 02:04:40,579
your screen. I'm safer. Two by three. Rise up. That was such a waste for an extension.

918
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:53,220
This is nothing happening. What are you doing? What's 253? What is 253? Why are you guys saying

919
02:04:53,220 --> 02:05:06,649
250? I'm not going to veto this. What a waste. What is on the roof? Oh, is the note. All right.

920
02:05:07,369 --> 02:05:23,619
That was record time. That was record roof time. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't fall

921
02:05:23,619 --> 02:05:32,869
off the edge. Do not walk off this edge. Do not. Don't. It's not worth it, Jeremy. Don't do it.

922
02:05:32,869 --> 02:05:40,789
Three years ago, Jeremy. Don't walk off the edge. I know you probably think it's going to be very,

923
02:05:40,789 --> 02:05:52,380
very funny, but it's not going to be funny. Don't do it. Don't fall off the fucking edge. Don't do

924
02:05:52,380 --> 02:06:19,100
it. It's funny. I'm laughing at that one. I don't care if it's me. It was fucking four years ago.

925
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:24,779
I don't remember saying that. That was funny. That was funny. I liked that one. If it would

926
02:06:24,779 --> 02:06:28,380
any other streamer doing that, I would have laughed at it. That was a funny joke. Guy from four years

927
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:44,149
ago. What? That game's not good. Who has this much blood? You would have died two pipes ago.

928
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:57,960
Okay. Oh, look. Another wedding ring. I'm the wedding ring killer. I kill people and then take

929
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:10,390
off the wedding ring. Here comes the fall joke. Find me if you can. I'm probably going to do it,

930
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:21,960
and that's the worst part about this. Looks as though the killer was decorating with this.

931
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:38,260
He's just a sick fuck. Okay. Here it comes. Here it comes. Red bag. Don't do it. The other half.

932
02:07:39,239 --> 02:07:45,399
I'm not this much of a dickhead. Each once are identified. Mrs. Antonia Maldonado,

933
02:07:46,039 --> 02:07:50,760
712 North Hill Street downtown. No, I'm not this much of a dickhead. I wouldn't just walk off the

934
02:07:50,760 --> 02:08:01,369
edge. Okay, well, we have an address. That's the end of the trail. Oh, we almost did. Yeah,

935
02:08:01,369 --> 02:08:12,470
it kind of has to be. Too bad to all those people that wasted their points. Whoa. I was

936
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:24,380
thinking there was going to be a fall joke. Sorry, guys. God, that was an explosion. It was Mrs.

937
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:29,420
Maldonado, right? That's affirmative. Right, so then there's a husband we should be looking for.

938
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:35,500
Get him. We've closed the case. Rusty's razor, of course. I don't want to question your tried

939
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:38,939
and tested technique. I'm going to T again. I'm going to be pissing out C. But doesn't the D.A.

940
02:08:38,939 --> 02:08:44,859
require sound casework before he'll close the book? No, he's got to confess. And you know,

941
02:08:44,859 --> 02:08:56,359
there's ways of getting. I'm sure. Testings and a stomach and everything that could process all

942
02:08:56,359 --> 02:09:20,779
this shit. Wait, why is this one black? Oh, no. It was actually to your benefit. Oh. Have a stomach.

943
02:09:20,779 --> 02:09:25,340
No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it. You guys don't realize your body

944
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:30,140
is a gigantic coin separation machine. You know when those old machines you put in the dime,

945
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:34,939
the nickel, the quarter, and it would go, put it in the right slot. If your body didn't have one

946
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:40,779
of those down there, we'd be in a lot of trouble. That's true. No, I get it. I know what he's saying.

947
02:09:40,779 --> 02:09:44,220
But the weird thing, though, is even those machines, sometimes you put like a penny in

948
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:48,140
and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot. So why are our bodies so good at?

949
02:09:49,819 --> 02:09:55,350
How come a nickel doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes? If you catch my drift.

950
02:10:04,779 --> 02:10:15,239
Sometimes I read the one comment that makes me laugh. Are you this stupid on purpose?

951
02:10:15,239 --> 02:10:36,789
I'm here. Which one's Kenny? Tables are turned now, haven't they, boys?

952
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:41,270
Hey, look, old man. We're sorry. Well, Kenny's not here.

953
02:10:48,539 --> 02:11:04,300
Kenny's not in this scene. Blatant one guy moment. I know. That wasn't bad aim.

954
02:11:10,489 --> 02:11:15,859
No, that wasn't bad aim. That was fine.

955
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:28,600
That was not bad aim. That was I shot once and the guy was running.

956
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:38,520
Blatant bad aim has to be very, very much confirmed. It's got to be like, holy shit,

957
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:44,010
that was horrendous. I want to subdued the last one. I want to scream either.

958
02:11:44,729 --> 02:11:58,920
Got to reload. He's got to reload. How do I tackle him? No scream is like, oh,

959
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:03,640
it's got to be fucking a scream. It can't be like, oh, or oh, I tried to hit X,

960
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:12,489
accidentally tackle. It's going to be like, oh, we're like, oh, it's time to eat lots of bacon.

961
02:12:12,489 --> 02:12:17,930
This is car 11 K shots fired at South Flower Street, Scott's garage. It's cold for here,

962
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:36,390
but just like it's down, I need an ambulance and corner. So the guy did die. 95. We've already had

963
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:44,899
too much bacon. What do we got? I'm surprised. No shirts, no night wing shirt, no star wars shirt,

964
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:53,770
no clip maps. I did that all the time. You guys eat eggs in one bite for us. One bite.

965
02:12:54,489 --> 02:12:59,300
You go to a breakfast place and you order to sunny set up eggs or two or whatever.

966
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:11,029
Shit, I'm not even looking up and sorry, the whole thing. I wasn't even looking.

967
02:13:12,789 --> 02:13:17,350
Watching this shit from an audience perspective, you don't get all of the other stuff like

968
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:23,670
sometimes I'm just I'm gone. When I'm talking like this, I'm gone.

969
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:27,720
I'm not even, the game is not even here. It's like,

970
02:13:28,439 --> 02:13:36,380
I'm just talking and there's nothing here and I just drive into shit. I don't understand.

971
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:44,739
But yeah, that's disgusting. Where we going? Then you think like 30% of the audience here.

972
02:13:45,539 --> 02:13:56,300
Let me restart it. Turma streams, chat, playing games. We got cul-de-sac smash,

973
02:13:57,350 --> 02:14:02,789
Ed Eddeney's candy machine, lunchroom rumble, or spin stadium. By the way, the title says

974
02:14:02,789 --> 02:14:21,850
Nickelodeon. Click map there though. Okay, we've got cul-de-sac smash. And there is a fucking

975
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:31,899
vroomer there too. Got pretty good radio, 44 million plays. Two in a row. You got to kidding

976
02:14:31,899 --> 02:14:49,689
me. It looks like this is going to be the one. Uh oh. No TF2 video. See how it is? I don't even

977
02:14:49,689 --> 02:15:03,260
remember this stream. Here we go. Cul-de-sac smash. Okay. Instructions. Accelerate. Let's turn

978
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:13,109
the ads already filled in. I can't do this. This music is going to make me fucking scream.

979
02:15:15,899 --> 02:15:21,899
This is nightmare music. I can't even talk. I have to take my headphones off.

980
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:27,100
When each derby to advance to the next location, earn cash by competing in derbies

981
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:29,500
and make repairs and build new go-karts in the shop.

982
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:35,609
In a collision, the faster go-kart does more damage. Keep an eye on your damage meter.

983
02:15:36,569 --> 02:15:47,239
Okay, peace driver. Does that just mean fast music? That's like cartoon fast?

984
02:15:48,359 --> 02:15:52,359
What does that mean? That's fast cartoon music.

985
02:15:54,840 --> 02:16:14,470
Okay, looks like we're going to be Ed. Here comes an impression. I'm going to go.

986
02:16:18,149 --> 02:16:24,229
I'm going to do it. Is it filled in? This is already filled in. Get a dollar for first prize.

987
02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:27,590
I'm going to do it. Okay, I'm ready. Zippy, pick a go-kart.

988
02:16:27,590 --> 02:16:30,710
If I have an excuse to do an Ed voice, like an Eddie voice.

989
02:16:32,069 --> 02:16:36,709
Oh, I'll do it. I'll do it every time. There's probably three impressions in

990
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:44,569
this part of the screen. This is so loud. Click maps. Are you stupid?

991
02:16:46,329 --> 02:17:02,729
Oh shit. This is on screen. Get off the screen. How are you supposed to play this?

992
02:17:05,909 --> 02:17:09,850
I don't understand what's happening. Is it just bumper cars?

993
02:17:09,850 --> 02:17:29,020
Could have done a loud game. Yeah. I guess golf is out. Why is Eddie just Bernie Sanders?

994
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:39,350
Okay, so what we're going to do is we are going to just, unfortunately, the one percent

995
02:17:40,149 --> 02:17:48,280
has all of the money. We've got to take it away. Kind of. Not really, though. That was fun.

996
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:59,659
All right. Okay. That was Ed, Edd, and Eddie. Thanks for playing Ed, Edd, and Eddie. I hated

997
02:17:59,659 --> 02:18:06,920
that. You can tell. You can tell that I was like, holy shit, get me the fuck out of this.

998
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:23,459
Please let me do anything else. I got to pee. Can I piss? I was like rage drinking water.

999
02:18:23,459 --> 02:18:28,739
I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. You got to keep like clicking on the screen. No, no, no, no,

1000
02:18:35,579 --> 02:18:51,940
oh, no. Oh, the only thing that this, if I do this, if I do this on camera, 500 community subs.

1001
02:18:52,579 --> 02:19:10,680
Oh, this is a, this could happen if you thought there was no chance that this was going to happen.

1002
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:20,540
I got news for you. I used to do that once every other day. Where are we going? Oh, no, no, no,

1003
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:32,809
not a face cam. This is possible. Oh, I'm going to do it. Well, I mean, you got to see once or

1004
02:19:32,809 --> 02:19:36,969
twice before you know when the things are happening. Your skill was a business trip. You'd miss a

1005
02:19:36,969 --> 02:20:00,520
meeting down the hall. They left airline. That's pretty good. God damn it. You got to be kidding

1006
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:10,219
me. 30 goddamn five in 2020. This is looking pretty good for three five. Excuse me. I've got

1007
02:20:10,219 --> 02:20:18,059
some donk donks to take care of the shirt. No, that is not a star wars shirt. It's not a star

1008
02:20:18,059 --> 02:20:36,420
wars shirt or a night wind shirt. This is before I got very, very upset. I said an email. What

1009
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:48,440
email did I say? What was the email? What email? Wait, what did I say? You said Pepe laugh. Oh,

1010
02:20:48,520 --> 02:21:11,540
shit. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, we got like three right now. Oh, shit. No, look at me is no

1011
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:31,579
baited. Don't do it. I'm too distracted to do the lion pose. It's not going to happen. That's not

1012
02:21:31,579 --> 02:21:55,540
mouth music. Me going. That's not mouth music. Mouth music is like me humming a beat or me beat

1013
02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:16,090
boxing or me like singing, not going like you get a purpose on remix four right now. You look like

1014
02:22:16,729 --> 02:22:24,340
you can't throw that. I'm trying to do remix six. Oh, don't do it. I can feel myself looking into

1015
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:35,260
the camera mule doing that post Billy. If I win by a large amount on one of these, I'm going to do

1016
02:22:35,260 --> 02:23:02,620
it. No screen either. It's kind of crazy.

1017
02:23:26,149 --> 02:23:51,860
You fucking idiot. You stupid asshole. God damn it. Just hit every shot from now on. Please.

1018
02:23:52,739 --> 02:24:16,790
That wasn't a scream. That was a yawn. That was a loud yawn. That was not a scream.

1019
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:28,299
Now, scream has to be very, very clear. Do not do any bad aim. Nailed it. No TF2 videos.

1020
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:36,219
I don't have any rhythm. Something that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the

1021
02:24:36,219 --> 02:24:41,739
remixes. It's you can't it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs

1022
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:49,139
that intercut into each other. That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's

1023
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:56,840
please. Stop. If I fall, I just need to, you know what I mean? You panic

1024
02:24:59,799 --> 02:25:04,360
because you know you're going to be skidding. Here comes the scream.

1025
02:25:05,479 --> 02:25:12,069
And this is late game too. I was fucking. What happened there? I did a full jump. That's worked

1026
02:25:12,069 --> 02:25:19,500
every single time. I did a full jump. What the fuck happened? I did a full jump. That's happened.

1027
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:27,540
That's worked every time. Come on, man. What? That's not a fall joke. Fall joke is

1028
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:31,299
somewhere where you're not supposed to fall ever aggravating. You walked up here.

1029
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:36,250
I'm waiting for a sorry. I forgot. I'm playing aggravation simulator.

1030
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:52,100
Oh, just rename it. Just do it. What? What? Oh, I call this jumping like just rename this game.

1031
02:25:52,819 --> 02:25:56,739
I'm trying to piss you off. That's it. Just that's what it's that's what it should be.

1032
02:25:56,739 --> 02:26:03,479
That's what it should be called. This is not about jumping. It's about trying to make as many

1033
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:16,040
and many people angry as possible. Terrible aim. I think this shit was in an episode of Dexter's

1034
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:20,440
lab one time. There was like an evil guy that like didn't want to make everybody like sad or

1035
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:27,500
like angry and gave them like a video game to play and it like worked. Oh no, sorry. That's the

1036
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:34,170
that's jump king. Right. What the fuck is he talking about? I think that's the same thing.

1037
02:26:39,079 --> 02:26:42,520
If you miss a jump. No, you missed. That's the whole point of the game is to miss jumps.

1038
02:26:44,389 --> 02:27:00,170
That was the powerpuff girl was from. That's from Phineas and Ferb. Is that show still on there?

1039
02:27:01,049 --> 02:27:09,659
Are they still making new Phineas and Ferb cartoons? No, talking about Vegas either,

1040
02:27:09,659 --> 02:27:16,569
which is weird. I'm going to get up to the top. How far away is the bud? Thank God. About halfway.

1041
02:27:19,059 --> 02:27:23,219
Why? What's wrong? Why? What's wrong? I'm going to get up there and scream. What's wrong with

1042
02:27:23,219 --> 02:27:35,500
Phineas and Ferb? Did it end it? Did it really? Once I get to the end game here. What's wrong with it?

1043
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:39,260
Phineas and Ferb was only good new age. The only good new age cartoon show.

1044
02:27:40,139 --> 02:27:51,350
It was years ago. I didn't say I was somebody in chat said that. I didn't say that. What are

1045
02:27:51,350 --> 02:27:57,030
some of the cartoons that were like worth watching? I don't remember. That's not me

1046
02:27:57,030 --> 02:28:03,379
talking. That's me responding to chat. Come on. That's not me saying that. That's not me saying

1047
02:28:03,379 --> 02:28:25,989
that. Nope. Holy shit. That's a that's an odd one. How do you get that jump? Holy fuck. How do you

1048
02:28:25,989 --> 02:28:38,920
supposed to get that? We're good. Didn't say shit. Wait, that's the first time I've seen this. Oh,

1049
02:28:38,920 --> 02:29:01,290
boy. Don't move. Don't move. I sound pretty calm. I saw them collected. What am I? Am I

1050
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:23,110
defeated at this point or what? Fall all the way. Still haven't nailed that down yet.

1051
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:34,059
Fall all the way down to the candles and I'll probably scream. Here comes. I'm not saved.

1052
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:47,540
Wow. That set the jump to the the jump to the it's just so hard to judge it.

1053
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:51,299
Even when you do a little one it doesn't seem like it's enough. Wow.

1054
02:29:59,719 --> 02:30:06,889
That's remarkable. It's already filled in. Don't even say it. It's been filled in.

1055
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:15,239
Get out there. It's only a minute left before this is done. I'll be back in an hour. Hey,

1056
02:30:15,239 --> 02:30:24,299
I'm gonna go get some boots. What size are you? 16. I've got these big ass goofy feet.

1057
02:30:35,659 --> 02:30:38,620
No, I'm I'm still perfectly fine at this point in the butt.

1058
02:30:42,139 --> 02:30:45,659
It's this this one. You got one more chance up here when I get up here. Didn't make that.

1059
02:30:46,549 --> 02:30:58,790
Why did I not make that? Wait, how did I not make it over that? Is the same person? I don't

1060
02:30:58,790 --> 02:31:09,510
understand. What? I'm shocked. Why am I so calm? Because it's wasted breath to be angry at a game

1061
02:31:10,229 --> 02:31:17,239
who was what was it was designed to make you hate everything about your current life. What

1062
02:31:17,239 --> 02:31:21,159
you're doing right now. I'm not going to let it win. I'm not going to give it the saddest.

1063
02:31:21,959 --> 02:31:29,559
I'm sorry to say. TV Robo. Well, plan on it.

1064
02:31:32,729 --> 02:31:37,530
This is the last week. I don't know. Look, I got all this to do first. I got

1065
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:40,969
we got Mario Sunshine to do first. That's priority number one. Did that. That was fun.

1066
02:31:43,129 --> 02:31:46,090
I was slowly going up the rankings now. It's pretty early in TV Robo.

1067
02:31:54,809 --> 02:32:00,250
Same joke as last week. I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.

1068
02:32:01,209 --> 02:32:15,899
I did Ocarina of Time. I don't think I have a lion mask. Where are we going? Cry of fear

1069
02:32:15,899 --> 02:32:27,479
co-op highlights. It was okay. I'm going to say something. Wait, where are we talking about?

1070
02:32:27,479 --> 02:32:39,670
Where are we going? I'm going to say some lion pose here. No, this is a real, real opinion.

1071
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:45,370
Thumbnail. What do you mean the thumbnail? What? I think I've said this before on stream.

1072
02:32:48,459 --> 02:32:54,100
Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done for the industry,

1073
02:32:54,739 --> 02:33:02,899
I respect it as a series. I understand why people love it. They don't do it for me.

1074
02:33:02,899 --> 02:33:13,399
Zelda games don't do it for me. That's it. That doesn't count. That does not count.

1075
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:20,920
It doesn't count. That's not the video I was watching. That's a separate video.

1076
02:33:21,479 --> 02:33:26,299
Oh, my fucking stomach.

1077
02:33:36,379 --> 02:33:56,069
Oh, my stomach. That was really good. That was really good. Lion pose possible. Lion pose.

1078
02:33:56,069 --> 02:34:03,290
I don't want to get any spoilers. I keep fucking going to this. I don't want any spoilers.

1079
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:16,899
All right. Let's take a quick pee break. Thank God. See you guys in like two minutes.

1080
02:34:16,899 --> 02:34:22,360
Oh, thank God. We're at pretty much the halfway point. Please, please take a piss.

1081
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:25,639
More to see. Step in straight minutes. Oh, I got to get some water.

1082
02:34:25,639 --> 02:34:29,399
Take a step in straight piss. Oh, wow. Thank God for that fucking RNG.

1083
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:41,139
Saved by the RNG God. RNG God. This is empty. I can't fucking believe it's in that thumbnail,

1084
02:34:42,870 --> 02:35:08,149
but it has to be in the video. It's so fucking funny. That is actually fucking funny.

1085
02:35:09,030 --> 02:35:15,930
That I mean, it does, but it doesn't count because it has to be in the stream or in the video that

1086
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:26,229
we're currently the time that we have. It can't be for a different video, but that should give you

1087
02:35:26,229 --> 02:35:33,620
confidence that within the next hour that it's going to show up somewhere, because if that was

1088
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:53,819
in a thumbnail, that means I do that shit all the fucking time. You have an opportunity with

1089
02:35:53,819 --> 02:36:03,979
the lion pose. Terrible aim. The this one's the most likely to happen before this for sure.

1090
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:10,090
I'm so glad we hit this right here because this is green screen movie night. This is

1091
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:17,899
I'm so this is that there's so many of these could happen in here.

1092
02:36:22,969 --> 02:36:35,139
Technical difficulty. Why go to the bathroom? Laughing fit could happen here too. And then

1093
02:36:35,139 --> 02:36:47,299
we just need a Star Wars shirt. Bad aim to the toilet. No, I see. I see what you're doing.

1094
02:36:47,299 --> 02:36:55,450
I get it. This is how long it takes, huh? What do you guys do when I go BRB?

1095
02:36:56,090 --> 02:37:10,760
What do you guys do? Go pee? Do you leave too? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's the whole

1096
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:33,450
five minutes. That'd be great. He's back. Fuck. He's back. Oh, so far these have been fucking

1097
02:37:33,450 --> 02:37:50,059
fantastic. That was a turbo room. He's back. He's back. Yeah. All right. So coming up next,

1098
02:37:50,059 --> 02:37:57,750
this one is called we'll be back. Hyper dimension. Germania Elbertson breaker.

1099
02:37:58,649 --> 02:38:05,979
What? Sounds good to me. All we need is a baseball video. Already got an interesting start.

1100
02:38:05,979 --> 02:38:12,409
All we need is a baseball video. That's true. And you'll get a laugh. Three, two, one. Here we go.

1101
02:38:16,729 --> 02:38:17,850
Life is paint.

1102
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:00,889
That was quick.

1103
02:39:51,579 --> 02:39:52,620
I gotta see this one again.

1104
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:15,319
This is, I love this. This one is called images of German 985 real. Do not watch at night.

1105
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:37,670
Hopefully it's not night, wherever any of you are. Oh, we're getting close. Star Wars shirt ends

1106
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:45,299
this whole thing. Terrible aim ends this whole thing. The lion pose ends this whole thing.

1107
02:40:46,020 --> 02:41:12,299
MS DOS games. Um, replace this line with your specific CD-ROM driver line. You only need to

1108
02:41:12,299 --> 02:41:22,760
use this line with DOS six on a CD-ROM to book. Oh yeah. You had to punch in some shit, right?

1109
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:32,120
Because the manual track instruction didn't work. Course one. Yeah. Course quiz. Before playing the

1110
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:36,280
game, you'll be asked to identify a piece of track from one of the five courses. Ignore the page

1111
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:42,200
reference. Use your mouse pointer with the correct piece. A 10. God damn it. G seven seven.

1112
02:41:47,100 --> 02:42:04,790
That's a bingo. That's a bingo. Hold on. Let me stunt driver. Hold on. Let's,

1113
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:17,350
let's do this together. Course quiz. On course two, page 40. On course two, what is the piece

1114
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:34,120
at location? Question mark. Course two. What is the piece at location? I five. I said three hours,

1115
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:44,969
right? I said within three hours if it happens. I needed 15 more minutes. Course two. I five. I can't

1116
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:53,530
is it one, two, three, four, five. Yeah, this is like, this is me meaning that I can't play the game.

1117
02:42:53,530 --> 02:43:11,610
Little oil can on the right. Straight line with an oil can on the right. I think it's this one. Hold on.

1118
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:39,139
All right, here we go. How do you drive? Hold on. I got my hand on it. Control,

1119
02:43:39,139 --> 02:44:00,260
alt, p, q, r. R is, I fucked it up. It's all right.

1120
02:44:06,229 --> 02:44:17,290
You're going the wrong way. Scream. Turn the car around. Q. How do I gear it into,

1121
02:44:18,090 --> 02:44:37,290
got it. Get it out of neutral. I can't put it in first gear.

1122
02:44:37,290 --> 02:45:07,219
Oh, no. Watch out for the skittles. Let's go. We're in the M&M's candy world. Oh my god.

1123
02:45:07,219 --> 02:45:19,690
Jerma Gaming. Oh my god. I can't believe it. Oh my god. Dude, Jerma. D, S, A. 200 community

1124
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:24,250
fucking subs. D. I really didn't think this was gonna happen. W. I thought I was, I didn't think

1125
02:45:24,250 --> 02:45:34,899
this was gonna happen. There's too many variables. R, Q, tab, shift, space, press one.

1126
02:45:37,459 --> 02:46:00,090
Not the candies. Oh, I just ran over everybody. Fill it up. Let's go. Fill it up. What just

1127
02:46:00,090 --> 02:46:23,129
happened? Oh, it's a new, new stream. What the fuck is happening? I can't turn off the crop.

1128
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:44,040
Hold on. Why is this going, why is there like fart noises? Okay, so.

1129
02:47:07,420 --> 02:47:14,489
I think, I think, I think I just got like shut off. I tried to do it again. I just tried to

1130
02:47:14,489 --> 02:47:28,899
do it again and I think they just like banned me. Hold on. Wait, wait, hold on a second. Hold on.

1131
02:47:28,899 --> 02:47:30,139
Hold on.

1132
02:47:35,049 --> 02:47:43,100
PayPal fraud alert. Are you trying to do this? Oh, Gabe Newell from Half Life

1133
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:54,950
Softworks. I got a PayPal fraud alert. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Whoa. Okay, so what,

1134
02:47:54,950 --> 02:48:00,149
everybody needs to settle down here. Okay. Yes, I'm Gabe Newell, I am. Okay, very much. Thank you.

1135
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:06,020
Yeah, okay, here we are. It was like, hey, by the way, somebody's done like,

1136
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:12,180
like, more than $1,000 on your PayPal account. Wow, interesting. Wow. Is this you, dude?

1137
02:48:13,059 --> 02:48:22,059
Yeah, it's me. Yeah, it's me. Hold on. Oh my god, another somebody else did it.

1138
02:48:24,739 --> 02:48:32,649
We are sorry. Let's go. We are delaying our new game to 2013. Hold on, I got fraud alerted. Yeah,

1139
02:48:32,649 --> 02:48:41,940
I know. Not many of you here today, unfortunately. We're delaying our new game to 2013. There's 100

1140
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:46,260
subs from Austin Plains. A few days ago. Fucking 100. A few days later. Freddie gave 100. When we

1141
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:51,379
reached out to Warner Brothers, we were assured the delay would be brought under control,

1142
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:57,379
at least for now. But no further information was forthcoming. Hold on, I have changed. At some

1143
02:48:57,379 --> 02:49:04,979
point in 2011, we also came across an official FAQ from Warner Brothers that stated. Let's do it

1144
02:49:04,979 --> 02:49:09,139
again. We would like to thank you for your great love and support of the Kingdom Hearts franchise.

1145
02:49:09,139 --> 02:49:14,100
What the fuck is happening on this stream? Somebody else gave 100. I just gave 100. Did it

1146
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:22,420
go through? Holy shit, every single person is going to get subbed on this channel. Every single

1147
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:33,459
fucking person will be subbed in this chat right now. Jesus Christ, who just did that?

1148
02:49:42,309 --> 02:49:47,270
The fact that this series takes on so many different forms, including the addition of a

1149
02:49:47,270 --> 02:49:53,350
new game feature. I'm losing my mind right now. I can't even take me talking. Reads the press release.

1150
02:49:54,389 --> 02:50:01,479
This is precisely what we'd like to introduce. I'm losing my fucking mind. Who just gave the 100

1151
02:50:01,479 --> 02:50:17,659
subs besides me? And that is all. Thank you. It was Abe Kashim. Fuck you. Yeah, I've wanted to say it

1152
02:50:17,659 --> 02:50:28,899
for a very long time. Fuck you all. I got 100 more to do and that's it. 100 more subs. This is

1153
02:50:28,899 --> 02:50:59,930
500 here. How could he say something like that? 35 more seconds. No, god damn it. I got a circle

1154
02:50:59,930 --> 02:51:08,809
in scream, by the way. There's been at least three screams. No, that's like the meme. Like my brain just

1155
02:51:08,809 --> 02:51:25,430
typed the thing that's the meme. What a fucking idiot. What an asshole. Where are we going?

1156
02:51:25,430 --> 02:51:36,180
Where are we going? I get another alert from people. No, no, no. Of all the places to go.

1157
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:46,680
That guy. No, not the Karazhan stream. That is a geared up tank. This is a 0.52%. The worst stream of

1158
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:49,879
all time. Just got queued up here. It's just walking around side by side. No, no, no, no.

1159
02:51:49,879 --> 02:51:56,459
Kill it, Danette. You tripped it. You tripped it. You tripped it. Is he DPS or heals?

1160
02:51:56,459 --> 02:52:04,549
Holy shit. This is the worst. This is the worst stream I've ever done. I can't fucking believe

1161
02:52:04,549 --> 02:52:13,510
Karazhan is here. All right, just need a healer. Just need a healer. The one time I played WoW on

1162
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:20,200
stream. Yeah, sanctuaries are where the Horde and Alliance can both be. And they do not. Dude,

1163
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:26,280
what did I forget? My PayPal password? I can't even get into my PayPal. I'm like locked out of

1164
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:37,420
my PayPal. Shatterer, Shatrath City, whatever it's called. And we're going to Blackrock Hold.

1165
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:43,829
I might get turned off for 24 hours. I think I just got turned off for 24 hours. We'll finish

1166
02:52:45,379 --> 02:52:58,219
in. Hey, come on, PayPal. I got the money. Over the edge. Heal us with your laugh. Oh, God. Stop,

1167
02:52:58,219 --> 02:53:02,700
Jeremy. Did it work? Walking around and fucking in. Yeah, Burning Crusade was the first time.

1168
02:53:02,700 --> 02:53:14,940
New friend. It's cool. You watched me from the toilet. Well, hi. Okay, I think we're good.

1169
02:53:15,579 --> 02:53:23,100
Sanctuary was the last Dalaran in Wrath. Yeah. Dermot, what's your eye level? Who the fuck is

1170
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:35,690
talking? 854. Oh, that's MLC Stealth. What's yours? There you go. 500 community subs. I'm a man of

1171
02:53:35,690 --> 02:53:43,959
my fucking work. 856. Thank you. What the heck? Oh, this stream sucks such ass. Like I'm going to

1172
02:53:43,959 --> 02:53:53,319
use my third video that I'm using. I'm using my Veto. Wow. Yeah, we just need a healer and then

1173
02:53:53,319 --> 02:54:00,329
we can get going. It's going to be this for like another 15 straight minutes. The Bloodhouse

1174
02:54:01,290 --> 02:54:16,229
vendor. Where is he? That's boo. I'll heal if you can't find anyone. I can't believe that. That

1175
02:54:16,229 --> 02:54:23,299
means you're going to have to get in here. Dodged a sub. You sound depressed in this video. Yeah,

1176
02:54:23,299 --> 02:54:29,690
because I'm playing Warcraft on stream. Bit too stuffy to talk. Oh, it's hard to be excited

1177
02:54:29,690 --> 02:54:36,659
about this game. He's new to Felforge. If I'm completely honest with you in that case. Yeah,

1178
02:54:36,659 --> 02:54:46,540
boo is sick. He can't really talk, but he can heal. I'm going to give it like another wipe the

1179
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:52,700
after I check out the vendor. If nobody, not even kidding. This is the worst stream I've ever done

1180
02:54:52,700 --> 02:55:07,000
in 10 years. This person over here. No, this is the worst stream I've ever done. I got one more

1181
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:17,940
Veto. My God. 200 order resources for one. Oh, nobody cares. Look at my inventory. Holy fuck.

1182
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:21,940
It's so bad. Look at how bad that looks. I never do the world quest. They give it. Why do you have

1183
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:25,459
this? Why do you have that in your backpack? Resources? Why is it in your backpack? There's

1184
02:55:25,459 --> 02:55:38,229
15 teeth in here. Delete the teeth. It's 15 teeth. 10. Oh, my. Nobody wants to watch this shit unless

1185
02:55:38,229 --> 02:55:42,069
you know what you're doing. I have like a shit load. I think I have like, I have like at least

1186
02:55:42,069 --> 02:55:48,090
like 40 or 50. I'm like on this character, bottom tier player and I don't even know what I'm doing.

1187
02:55:48,090 --> 02:55:53,610
And I, I, I still, I, I still click the mouse on moves. Got a lot of money. That was a lot of

1188
02:55:53,610 --> 02:56:00,969
money back then. Holy shit. Go kill the world boss. We could do that while we wait eight hours of this

1189
02:56:02,409 --> 02:56:05,829
Now, let's just do that. Let's go. Let's go kill the world boss. Yes, this was.

1190
02:56:07,129 --> 02:56:13,319
25,000 gold was not a lot of money. Four years ago. Five years ago. Yes, it was. You guys,

1191
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:17,719
there's always an auto cam. That was, that was a decent amount of money at the end of the stream.

1192
02:56:17,719 --> 02:56:26,340
That's not going to be for a long time. High mountain, right? Yeah. Guys that are here for the

1193
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:32,729
dungeon. We're going to just go get the world boss real quick. Oh yeah. This is when MLC self was

1194
02:56:32,729 --> 02:56:39,290
like snorting up the fucking boogers all stream. I remember. Yeah. I remember this. That was another

1195
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:46,700
reason why this stream was so mad. Where are you going to fly to Stonehoof for? It was like sick.

1196
02:56:55,159 --> 02:57:03,219
Uh, stop. Where are you? I'm watching wrestling. Okay. I'm watching what you should be watching.

1197
02:57:03,219 --> 02:57:08,579
You need to get like geared up for this Sunday. Hell in a cell where you're not going to know any

1198
02:57:08,579 --> 02:57:13,860
of the story. I love how fucking tuned out you are right now. Yeah. Wait. Yeah. What are you saying?

1199
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:18,579
I'm saying where do you, where are you flying to to do the world? To iron horn enclave, which is

1200
02:57:18,579 --> 02:57:28,760
the high mountain. I'm also about to blow my nose. I'm going to blow my nose. No. I fucking told you.

1201
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:39,079
I told you this is what happened. I told you. What time is it? It's the three PM. It's Alex.

1202
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:59,639
What? Wrestling bosses and wow. My God. This is so boring. It wasn't even that loud. Oh,

1203
02:57:59,639 --> 02:58:06,459
it got louder progressively. This is excruciating. Who did what again? He went like, and then he went

1204
02:58:06,620 --> 02:58:23,079
and action cam might be cool for melee. You can message people across realm, but you have to add

1205
02:58:23,079 --> 02:58:33,459
the realm that they're in as well as the name. Who's here? Who is it? Who goes there? Hello stream.

1206
02:58:33,459 --> 02:58:43,799
Oh, hi. I just woke up. You sound like you got a raspy voice. Well, if you want to do carousel

1207
02:58:45,239 --> 02:58:52,920
voice has actually been getting better. That is you want to do carousel attunement where you have

1208
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:56,520
to do. Why is that covering the whole screen? I did hear that there was a big,

1209
02:58:57,719 --> 02:59:04,200
a big deal. Thanks fucking God. We're out of here. Thank you, Lord. Get us the fuck out of here.

1210
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:12,149
We're up here. 74. Let me, uh, let me just give me one second. I want to check the patch.

1211
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:22,629
Now we're in the Punisher. We got a bad uncut patch. I mean, it's, we are, it's already done.

1212
02:59:22,629 --> 02:59:29,770
We already did this. It's already over the gore level setting. It's high or none. I already

1213
02:59:29,770 --> 02:59:41,139
changed it. What about a full blackout? A full blackout is just, I mean,

1214
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:50,629
that's going to be very difficult to do. Go for double bingo. No, no, I can't give any more subs.

1215
02:59:51,829 --> 02:59:57,829
PayPal is going to seriously like call me. If I give another hundred community subs,

1216
02:59:57,829 --> 03:00:02,229
I'm going to get called by PayPal. They're going to be like, Hey dude, like somebody guaranteed

1217
03:00:02,229 --> 03:00:07,510
hack your account. Guaranteed. I'm going to be like, no, they didn't actually have this one.

1218
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:16,020
PC gaming with a gore patch 3.5, but honest to God, there was a lot of money that came in.

1219
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:21,059
Yeah. There was like three or four other people that gave $50 to a hundred subs.

1220
03:00:21,059 --> 03:00:26,520
It was fucking crazy. What happened? It was almost a thousand subs brought in during that

1221
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:34,860
whole debacle. Uninstall the old one. How do you uninstall the old patch? Isn't it like a hook into

1222
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:42,200
can I just remove the exe here and that'll be fine. Remove the, what am I talking about?

1223
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:46,040
Yeah. If you didn't believe the technical difficulties, we're going to happen.

1224
03:00:46,680 --> 03:00:52,120
It happened right now. I have a backup of everything, but that's doesn't include the,

1225
03:00:52,120 --> 03:00:56,760
yeah, that's absolutely. Yeah, but I got to know this. This is a full on bingo profile

1226
03:00:56,760 --> 03:01:02,440
over here without any fucking around. I'm going to copy this profile and move it over here. I'm

1227
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:15,190
going to try this patch profile paste, replace this file, do more just for fun. Yeah. We don't

1228
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:19,350
need the bingo anymore. Gore patch 3.5. I'm just going to start skipping around.

1229
03:01:24,219 --> 03:01:29,020
Congratulations to those that got the community subs and congratulations to me for just paying

1230
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:38,659
myself money and giving a bunch of it to Twitch. We are going to turn off the, you can eat a lot

1231
03:01:38,659 --> 03:01:42,899
of it and not really feel that guilty, but it's high in fat. Just be careful. Don't go crazy.

1232
03:01:45,110 --> 03:01:48,709
What, what is it? You don't want to like cause like a stomach problem or like a digestive issue

1233
03:01:48,709 --> 03:01:51,350
for yourself. If you're just like, I'm going to eat a jar of peanut butter every day.

1234
03:01:52,309 --> 03:01:56,579
No, that peanut butter is good for you. High quality proteins, especially after you fucking

1235
03:01:56,579 --> 03:02:07,079
work out. This is the Africa. I used to like to do a spoonful of tahini before bed. Yeah. Okay.

1236
03:02:07,079 --> 03:02:13,510
Next. This thing, this is not going to fit in a priority box. This will, this will not fit in

1237
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:30,229
the box. It's massive. Destroy all humans. He's going to get a pub G win. That was your last

1238
03:02:30,229 --> 03:02:39,930
veto. What? No, the game is over. You won. You guys won the game. Can you buy the dream cast

1239
03:02:39,930 --> 03:02:45,540
is coming with me. This is pretty random stuff is coming with it is a junk company just coming to

1240
03:02:47,059 --> 03:02:49,379
take care of all the stuff that I can't take with me.

1241
03:02:51,139 --> 03:03:00,549
I didn't say Vegas. I can't extract these guys. I don't have that yet. I didn't talk about Vegas.

1242
03:03:00,549 --> 03:03:07,530
I said it's not coming with me here with me. Where didn't we calculate this on stream?

1243
03:03:09,129 --> 03:03:12,649
We did like how the dimensions of the thing. And it said I couldn't ship it. I had to go like,

1244
03:03:12,649 --> 03:03:21,270
get like this. I had to get special treatment. That's not a requirement. Ass hat. We already

1245
03:03:21,270 --> 03:03:25,370
looked at this on stream. I remember we were sitting there. We were looking at like pricing

1246
03:03:25,370 --> 03:03:37,959
for stuff. It was like, is this a shitload of money? He's going to say it's 400 pounds,

1247
03:03:39,180 --> 03:03:43,500
200 or 400. Doesn't matter. I'm talking about shipping my computer with the United's postal

1248
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:50,860
saver. The United's postal savers. No, I need to transmog these. Leave them.

1249
03:04:00,790 --> 03:04:12,899
It's not worth anal prom with these guys right now. Next. Why you continue to throw rocks at my

1250
03:04:12,899 --> 03:04:24,309
house? I thought we were over that. I wish I could pause this, but I can't. The last Simpsons hit and

1251
03:04:24,309 --> 03:04:31,270
run thing that we saw was talking about people throwing rocks at my house. This is I feel so

1252
03:04:31,270 --> 03:04:40,489
unfulfilled. I'm so unfulfilled. What's the fastest way to lose? Drive into the ocean?

1253
03:04:47,799 --> 03:04:57,340
It was just this level for two hours. You gotta be kidding me. Just drive to the,

1254
03:04:57,340 --> 03:05:05,670
just like go to the power plant, I guess. Yeah, this is the end game here. This is the final

1255
03:05:05,670 --> 03:05:08,149
mission of the game. Just exit the car at the beginning of the mission.

1256
03:05:13,940 --> 03:05:25,770
It might be faster to just beat the missions. Same joke as last week. I was done. It was so

1257
03:05:25,770 --> 03:05:47,940
close. Oh, just wait the 20 seconds. I sound so done. Our number 10. I remember being at our

1258
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:53,459
number 10 or 11 and we got a big raid that came in and I was not in the game. This is a,

1259
03:05:53,540 --> 03:05:58,899
and I was fucking furious. And I remember we got a huge raid and I had to like prop myself up and

1260
03:05:58,899 --> 03:06:06,739
be like, Hey everybody, welcome to the raid. Hi, thank you. I can't just like, fuck it up.

1261
03:06:06,739 --> 03:06:16,540
Where are we going? L.A. Why is it L.A. Noire again? Where's the crime scene?

1262
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:24,020
This is part four of L.A. Noire. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's right. That's right. That's

1263
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:30,540
right. In the fountain, we shall shine. Nope. That'll get rising revenge. No, this is all over

1264
03:06:30,540 --> 03:06:37,700
the place. What are you guys doing? This changes. What is happening right now? As you click maps.

1265
03:06:40,899 --> 03:06:49,610
How is this even possible? 30, 36, 39, 32, 36, 31, 36, 34. What? This doesn't make me sense.

1266
03:06:53,559 --> 03:06:57,000
Oh, I know what's happening. Nevermind. Everyone. People are clicking on both

1267
03:06:57,000 --> 03:07:02,360
because 12, 15,000 people have clicked the screen. Okay. Well, I need to change that.

1268
03:07:09,909 --> 03:07:14,389
One click per user. That's the exact same thing. Yeah.

1269
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:21,270
Finding more bugs would be nice as well. All right. Well, what's, um, how long have we been

1270
03:07:21,270 --> 03:07:25,370
streaming for? Like two and a half hours, something like that? Yeah, about two hours or so. Nothing.

1271
03:07:27,059 --> 03:07:31,879
When is there anything else you would like to do, my friend, or are you going to want to do?

1272
03:07:31,879 --> 03:07:38,219
It's all up to you. Do you have another game you'd like to play? Um, I mean, we could hop into

1273
03:07:38,219 --> 03:07:41,260
something like GTA if you wanted to, for like an hour or something.

1274
03:07:42,870 --> 03:07:49,430
Oh, it's been two hours. Yeah. 2000, uh, needs a break or something. Just let me know.

1275
03:07:49,430 --> 03:07:56,489
2017, 2016, German. Two hours stream. It's been enough for me. All right. Well, yeah, that's it

1276
03:07:56,489 --> 03:08:00,329
for this, this particular stream. I'm going to take a pee break. I'll be right back. Oh, if you're

1277
03:08:00,329 --> 03:08:03,530
turning off your stream, then I'll turn off. Oh, no, no, no, no. I mean like this like particular

1278
03:08:03,530 --> 03:08:09,930
game. That's what I said. I didn't make it fucking clear enough to me.

1279
03:08:16,069 --> 03:08:20,549
I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. Just enjoy the fucking random bullshit that you see. I'll be

1280
03:08:20,549 --> 03:08:49,000
right back. I'm having so much fun right now. This is perfect. I'm having a blast right now.

1281
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:59,350
I really am. This is fucking fun. Oh, my like head hurts from just like laughing internally

1282
03:08:59,350 --> 03:09:03,510
right there. First question. God, the receptionist part of the wedding. I did better at this game

1283
03:09:03,510 --> 03:09:09,059
and I love high school. All right. No more fucking jokes. No more messing around. We're going to

1284
03:09:09,059 --> 03:09:14,180
play an action that worsens an already bad situation to set the head, add insult to injury.

1285
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:21,030
You seem certain it's a, oh man, that's so fucking fun. And you're right.

1286
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:30,329
Right. Laughing internally. They're going to run out of $100 questions.

1287
03:09:33,639 --> 03:09:37,959
They're going to run out of the $100 questions. Add insult to rights.

1288
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:43,000
Okay, come on. Give me the $32,000. I got my lifelines.

1289
03:09:49,799 --> 03:09:52,360
It's beautiful. We see the love of your life coming down the aisle.

1290
03:09:53,719 --> 03:09:56,280
According to a well-known proverb, what do many hands make?

1291
03:09:57,239 --> 03:10:12,260
Many hands. I ain't doing it. You know, it didn't happen. Smosh did it. I'm not,

1292
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:22,950
I don't care if Smosh did this. Well, I don't like, I've never watched Smosh.

1293
03:10:23,670 --> 03:10:29,670
So they did that Pokemon video like nine years ago. All right. What do I do with these two tabs?

1294
03:10:30,629 --> 03:10:33,829
Sweetheart, I know you're watching right now. I'm working on two tabs.

1295
03:10:34,549 --> 03:10:45,270
Can't get waxed. Not going to happen. Hey, sweetie. Not going to happen. All right. Time

1296
03:10:45,270 --> 03:10:57,370
to connect the arms. Wait, what's happening? Hold on. Connect the arms and the orange strings.

1297
03:10:59,129 --> 03:11:05,590
Thread them properly. Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R-zool on it and

1298
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:12,899
tie it to the arm. Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R-symbol on it.

1299
03:11:15,420 --> 03:11:19,819
For this fucking guy. All right. Hold on. What'd I miss? What? Hold on. What? What? What?

1300
03:11:19,819 --> 03:11:24,409
Hold on. He's so handsome. What happened? What are you talking about?

1301
03:11:31,350 --> 03:11:49,370
Drunk, sweaty. Wait, what? Drunks. Who the fuck is out there?

1302
03:11:54,139 --> 03:12:04,100
Fucking weirdo. Holy shit. That was a fucking pog moment. Holy shit. That was unbelievable.

1303
03:12:04,659 --> 03:12:16,649
Imagine being that quick. That was it. No. The first VR we've seen all night. Thank you,

1304
03:12:16,649 --> 03:12:37,979
Walt Disney. I mean, it's locked. It's too quiet. I'll get it. Hold on. I need to replace this with

1305
03:12:37,979 --> 03:12:51,379
something, obviously. Got to have to come back later. Any other doors? This is so. I'm having

1306
03:12:51,379 --> 03:13:00,950
a blast. This is so fucking fun. Coin. Everybody, thank Lazy Luke for making this possible.

1307
03:13:01,750 --> 03:13:08,729
On a stupid whim of shit that we were talking about. Literally not even a day ago in the

1308
03:13:08,729 --> 03:13:15,180
pre-stream chat. I made a reference to this. Oh, not even a full day ago. And this shit is

1309
03:13:15,180 --> 03:13:24,500
ready to be used now. Not even a full day later. That's unfucking believable. No problems. It

1310
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:28,899
worked like a fucking charm. Like it's been great. It's been absolutely fucking fantastic.

1311
03:13:28,899 --> 03:13:35,100
I have to like make this coin do something on the wall over there. I'm going to assume. By the way,

1312
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:41,879
that is sky. If you feel like it, you can do this too. This is available for anyone just to play

1313
03:13:41,879 --> 03:13:45,639
with. We'll figure that out later. If you mean, obviously, you'd just be watching old streams

1314
03:13:45,639 --> 03:14:00,520
and videos, but it is available. Serma.org slash random. You can play with it yourself. Sky Hunter.

1315
03:14:00,520 --> 03:14:04,840
I'm actually going to take a second just because there's a lot of people that probably didn't see

1316
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:10,540
this in the beginning. Let me just go ahead and do this real quick because there's a lot of people

1317
03:14:10,540 --> 03:14:15,829
that weren't here in the beginning. Oh, dad, can I at least get some tuna fish next time?

1318
03:14:15,829 --> 03:14:28,180
Remember that? Write that down. That's a map. Okay. So if you're curious how this all works.

1319
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:38,149
So this website is it's Serma.org slash random. This is my entire life on the internet. So this

1320
03:14:38,149 --> 03:14:44,620
is probably like 90% of everything I've ever done. If you click this button, you're going to pull from

1321
03:14:45,959 --> 03:14:59,590
778 streams and 712 videos. So just for the people that weren't here before. Now I know

1322
03:14:59,590 --> 03:15:03,510
that some people that have just trickling in and just like, no, why the fuck would I want to

1323
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:10,149
skip through 3200 hours for your fucking shitty stream? You don't have to. I'm just the website

1324
03:15:10,149 --> 03:15:21,850
is available for anybody to use. Let's see another shitty stream. Get out quick. Oh, I'm stuck. No,

1325
03:15:21,850 --> 03:15:42,940
get back in. Get in. Someone gifted me a sub. A lot of gifts. It was probably me. In the back.

1326
03:15:44,139 --> 03:15:54,090
It was probably me. What? You will not have the countdown. No, because this is a special

1327
03:15:54,090 --> 03:16:01,129
thing made for the stream. So you can watch as long as you want. And you can just skip

1328
03:16:01,129 --> 03:16:06,229
whenever the fuck you want. Pick another spot. 700,000 games. That's a pretty good one.

1329
03:16:06,229 --> 03:16:17,799
Fuck it. Super Mario maker. Pretty good job. I just wanted that longer than seven seconds.

1330
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:32,340
This is the McChicken stream. Well, this is, it's a nine hour stream. So

1331
03:16:34,809 --> 03:16:37,850
when are we going to get Jerma's family dinner? Oh, did you just get it?

1332
03:16:41,579 --> 03:16:46,379
Lightning round? No. Okay. We're probably going to pull it back. This is probably going to be the

1333
03:16:46,379 --> 03:16:52,459
end of the stream. Um, just wanted to do something fun today. Just experiment with some stuff.

1334
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:59,750
We're going to do a lightning round. I will see you guys tomorrow for community content night.

1335
03:17:00,950 --> 03:17:08,840
And it's happening tomorrow. So it's time for a lightning round. Every five seconds,

1336
03:17:08,840 --> 03:17:19,129
we're going to press the button. Here we go. Monster hunter three. I need to kill these things

1337
03:17:19,129 --> 03:17:24,010
anyways. So old. Not a big deal. I think Kim is, this is the first time Kim ever showed up on video.

1338
03:17:28,149 --> 03:17:31,110
Yeah. This is, this is a Kim appearance. The first time ever.

1339
03:17:37,239 --> 03:17:43,059
Whatever. Amid evil part two. You guys have to keep linking shit from my birthday.

1340
03:17:43,940 --> 03:17:56,440
Is it my birthday? When the fuck did I play this? Wasn't this like two months ago? Enter at the

1341
03:17:56,440 --> 03:18:06,040
dungeon. Picket fence credits. And I don't have a single memory. I never played this. I don't have

1342
03:18:06,040 --> 03:18:11,129
a memory of playing this. I didn't. I've never played this. When did I play this? Are you crying?

1343
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:18,440
Was that your king? Get fucking sod. I've never played this game. When did I play this?

1344
03:18:19,079 --> 03:18:29,860
Uh, wasn't there a chest that I couldn't open? Is there anything else I could buy?

1345
03:18:29,860 --> 03:18:34,680
This is freaking me out. I don't remember ever opening this. I'll try. I'll give it a go. Why not?

1346
03:18:35,399 --> 03:18:49,690
It was just once. That's it? What a monster. This actually might mess me up because it's going to be

1347
03:18:49,690 --> 03:18:57,290
bouncing all over the place. See how much damage it does. 2006. Oh, hello. Let's go. Oh, here's a

1348
03:18:57,290 --> 03:19:09,030
Might and Magic 3. This is the best unit I can make. Worst stream? What? You're bringing in so

1349
03:19:09,030 --> 03:19:12,870
many people. I've just spent so much money. This was not the worst stream of last year. So many

1350
03:19:12,870 --> 03:19:21,110
people. I'm going to win. The turtle wins the race. Did you see the end of that movie?

1351
03:19:25,209 --> 03:19:36,860
Oh, I love this game. Condemn 2. What font is the bandicam font? Oh, wow. We landed on

1352
03:19:36,940 --> 03:19:42,219
not only unregistered hyper cam. Holy shit. What a thing to land on.

1353
03:19:44,680 --> 03:19:51,000
That's that's better. That's much better. Unregistered hyper cam is five times funnier.

1354
03:19:52,600 --> 03:20:00,309
Don't skip. I won't. It's going to skip in a minute. Stop the timer. I can't stop the timer.

1355
03:20:00,309 --> 03:20:09,559
It's going to be down a little bit. Extended. I can't. All right. Somebody extended. Somebody

1356
03:20:09,559 --> 03:20:19,450
extended. OK, I'm ready. All right. That's good. Should be right here. Should be right here.

1357
03:20:21,370 --> 03:20:42,309
There it is. We're having fun on our game. I honestly don't know what's going on. Put dot net.

1358
03:20:45,780 --> 03:20:46,420
Dot net.

1359
03:20:46,420 --> 03:21:13,909
It's got like a weird text to it and it's black. This should be put in the Library of Congress.

1360
03:21:14,709 --> 03:21:20,219
This is staying on for the remainder of the stream. I hope you guys are aware of this.

1361
03:21:25,129 --> 03:21:31,190
It looks a little like glitchy, right? Just put the picture at the top. That's true. I

1362
03:21:31,190 --> 03:21:38,680
could just do that. This belongs in a museum. This is for cultural significance.

1363
03:21:41,510 --> 03:22:03,590
You guys are fucking crazy. It's got to be perfect. All right, let's play. Turn down the stream

1364
03:22:03,590 --> 03:22:14,579
resolution. I don't. This joke is a bit. That's a funny joke. If it wasn't real,

1365
03:22:15,620 --> 03:22:24,100
because it's actually real. Somebody said imagine low quality. OK, imagine if we had just stopped

1366
03:22:24,100 --> 03:22:30,069
watching the Nancy Drew stream, like not even an hour ago. Oh, this would have been the worst

1367
03:22:30,069 --> 03:22:34,790
stream of 2020. That could cause a problem. If I didn't veto that, this would have been the worst

1368
03:22:34,790 --> 03:22:49,139
stream of 2020 for sure. How does this sound? Does this sound fucked up? Are we losing quality?

1369
03:22:53,860 --> 03:22:58,579
I thought about it. It floated around in my brain for a little while. How does that sound?

1370
03:22:58,579 --> 03:23:17,500
To let it play out for an hour and 40 minutes. OK, like that. Remove my pop filter too. OK,

1371
03:23:17,500 --> 03:23:26,979
hold on. I need a fan on the background too. All right, let's do. How about this? I don't even

1372
03:23:26,979 --> 03:23:35,350
know what this is going to do. Imagine if I played a video game. It's going to do. I don't know.

1373
03:23:35,350 --> 03:23:40,149
Half of these clips we'd stop in or just don't know what any of them mean and not even playing

1374
03:23:40,149 --> 03:23:49,190
a video game. I got to remember where these were. Oh, guys, no, I have a much better idea.

1375
03:23:53,430 --> 03:24:01,739
We're turning on the webcam audio. That's some gross hair. People talk shit about the hair I

1376
03:24:01,739 --> 03:24:08,790
have now. I can't pull it in. Really? 2017 hair was way grosser than this. How does it sound now?

1377
03:24:08,790 --> 03:24:18,329
Pretty terrible. That's some gross hair. Wait, I might be able to. I actually think I can. Let's

1378
03:24:18,329 --> 03:24:32,440
see. It was awful lighting. We still have awful lighting. How's this, guys? Hey, hey everybody.

1379
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:43,639
Yeah, make the quality of the camera terrible too. OK. So I did this video. I'm going to show you

1380
03:24:43,639 --> 03:24:55,750
my new favorite game that I played. Let's make the camera look terrible. What is making the

1381
03:24:55,750 --> 03:25:01,610
quality awful? Didn't I one day? One day wasn't there a scenario where I had my webcam mic plugged

1382
03:25:01,610 --> 03:25:07,100
in and I didn't know for like two hours or something? We can do custom resolution. We're

1383
03:25:07,100 --> 03:25:18,620
going to change that. When was that? That was recently, right? Oh dear. Kiss him. I don't know

1384
03:25:18,620 --> 03:25:26,260
where it went. I'm not going to kiss him. Where did it go? It looked so awful on my screen,

1385
03:25:26,260 --> 03:25:39,850
but it disappeared because it was 160 by 90. Where is it? Pretend to be the mom. Where's the

1386
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:55,049
camera? It's gone. There is no. Mom is upstairs and you can't hear. Hold on. Let me see if I can.

1387
03:25:55,049 --> 03:26:09,850
Here we go. Almost there. Let me see something real quick. So if I do this, if I go like this,

1388
03:26:09,850 --> 03:26:22,379
is that possible to? OK. Honey? Honey? OK, honey, it's time to come downstairs. Come downstairs

1389
03:26:22,379 --> 03:26:31,750
right now. There's a couple more things we can do. We're going to sharpen the fuck out of this.

1390
03:26:31,750 --> 03:26:41,530
Are you still playing? It's time for dinner. Add an echo? Are you? Are you still playing

1391
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:48,649
that game downstairs? This looks like I'm from fucking 1930. Is he in a fucking cave?

1392
03:26:48,649 --> 03:26:52,969
And we're going to put a long con on here. I'm going to make it look like a fucking terrible

1393
03:26:52,969 --> 03:27:10,709
streamer. It's time for dinner. Fucking ghost mob. One more thing. What's there? Put up the

1394
03:27:10,709 --> 03:27:17,590
saturation like fucking crazy. Are you streaming? God, I'm going to tell your father about this.

1395
03:27:17,590 --> 03:27:28,920
That's good. That's too high. Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you streaming? Are you?

1396
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:33,639
How's that? Is that a fight? Is that fine? That's too good. I know. It is pretty good.

1397
03:27:33,639 --> 03:27:53,690
Thanks, Jeremy. Wow. No, that's obvious. That's too obvious. And I got to be in the wrong spot.

1398
03:27:57,129 --> 03:28:02,569
Somebody extend it. Down here? Extend in a few minutes. Extend in a few minutes.

1399
03:28:02,569 --> 03:28:06,729
And I'm going to be like fucking silent. My webcam is going to be in a wicked embarrassing place.

1400
03:28:07,370 --> 03:28:29,559
All right, we're good. Hey, what are you doing? That's good, man. I got to get in my acting mode.

1401
03:28:29,559 --> 03:28:53,819
It's desynced. What are you doing? Holy shit, this looks so fucking bad. Hold on. Let me move this.

1402
03:28:53,819 --> 03:28:58,379
Remember, like everybody needs to fucking be in on this because I need some people are going to

1403
03:28:58,379 --> 03:29:04,649
trickle in randomly and I have to be like a piece of shit. You know what I mean? Okay, that's fine.

1404
03:29:04,649 --> 03:29:15,979
I'm just going to add one more thing. It's so funny because people were. This needs to be.

1405
03:29:15,979 --> 03:29:21,340
People were writing like your stream sucks and shit like that. Like, fuck you, dude.

1406
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:29,610
Maybe I can. Yes, I can. Can I? Oh, fuck, dude. Oh, my God. It's about to get so much worse.

1407
03:29:29,610 --> 03:29:36,340
I'm apologizing in advance. This is going to look fucking terrible.

1408
03:29:36,340 --> 03:29:40,020
I'm going to fuck up the footage, too. A lot of people were in on it. It was awesome.

1409
03:29:40,020 --> 03:29:57,530
Good call. If you came to this stream that was this one, this person is view-botting,

1410
03:29:57,530 --> 03:30:01,610
right? If they were like at this point, this is like two or three years ago, something like that.

1411
03:30:01,610 --> 03:30:05,909
There was probably what? Fifteen hundred, two thousand people watching this stream.

1412
03:30:05,909 --> 03:30:10,709
Like you're a view-botting fuck. We need to pass it through one more time. You are a view-botter

1413
03:30:10,709 --> 03:30:16,620
if you have a stream like this that has like three thousand people on it, right? Like you have,

1414
03:30:16,620 --> 03:30:25,219
like there's no way you don't have an unregistered Hypercam 2 stream. Holy shit. This looks, look at

1415
03:30:25,219 --> 03:30:30,409
this. Look, you can even see it. You can see like the pixels moving. Imagine how angry you'd be if

1416
03:30:30,409 --> 03:30:41,049
you came to this stream and you saw that this guy had like a hundred and forty p quality and he was

1417
03:30:41,049 --> 03:30:53,620
just like blowing his nose and shit. I thought this was real. I'm serious. Was this one of your

1418
03:30:53,620 --> 03:31:11,129
first streams? That makes me so happy. By the way, this is like, this is like irreversible.

1419
03:31:11,129 --> 03:31:15,049
Quick, extend it. All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. Extend it one more time.

1420
03:31:15,049 --> 03:31:21,579
Extend it one more time. Room lights. Yep. Extend it. Some of you guys have a shitload of

1421
03:31:21,579 --> 03:31:31,620
room lights. Turn off the light. Yep. You got to be sitting in a dark room, completely empty.

1422
03:31:31,620 --> 03:31:35,139
I'm going to turn these off, at least low enough where it looks really fucking creepy. And like,

1423
03:31:35,139 --> 03:31:40,059
I don't, I don't know what I'm doing. And then we're going to play and everybody needs to,

1424
03:31:40,059 --> 03:31:45,399
you guys need to be in on this because somebody, somebody eventually is going to come to the stream

1425
03:31:45,399 --> 03:31:54,819
and be like, what the fuck is going on here? Why does this guy have any viewers? I see. I told you.

1426
03:31:54,819 --> 03:32:01,879
No, that has to be it. I get it. I look like a fucking serial killer. Okay. Do everyone pretend

1427
03:32:01,879 --> 03:32:16,180
to be bots? Right. Right. The bot messages. How's that? Oh, wow, man. Cool kill. This is such a fun,

1428
03:32:16,180 --> 03:32:24,940
epic stream. Smiley face. Same joke. No, I'm laughing. That was somebody in chat that said that.

1429
03:32:24,940 --> 03:32:46,500
I'm laughing at a chat joke from like three years ago. I don't know what I did. I have to go over

1430
03:32:46,500 --> 03:33:49,610
here. No, this guy here. Fuck, man. Fucking. How do I go up there? What? What are you doing?

1431
03:33:49,690 --> 03:33:59,290
No, I'll go to bed in like an hour. It's two a.m. Yeah. Okay. I'll be up in like 20 minutes.

1432
03:34:50,569 --> 03:34:55,500
No, it's not what I wanted to do.

1433
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:35,940
Perhaps it's your drinking. My drinking is not an issue.

1434
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:44,389
I'll go get this processed. In the meantime, Farrell wants to see you in his office for a mission.

1435
03:35:45,829 --> 03:35:47,850
Fucking it. Keep your cool.

1436
03:35:51,610 --> 03:35:56,329
People in the chat right now. Yo. Like pretending that this is happening right now.

1437
03:35:56,969 --> 03:36:12,739
Dude, like, oh, pog, dude. Nice shot. Like, what the fuck? Oh, you guys are going to kill me one day.

1438
03:36:13,540 --> 03:36:17,139
You're going to kill me one day. I'm going to die on stream one day from something like that.

1439
03:36:17,139 --> 03:36:21,930
Of course, I take like a sip of fucking water. What is what? What the fuck am I thinking?

1440
03:36:22,969 --> 03:36:36,739
Is it weird that I don't want to stop doing this? Nice shot, man.

1441
03:36:39,299 --> 03:36:43,940
Keep doing it. All right. I'm going to give I'm going to make a timer for like Siri.

1442
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:50,629
I took a sip of water and choked on it. I got one more. I got one more bit I want to do.

1443
03:36:51,510 --> 03:36:57,750
No, no more bits. No more bits. Let's get the fuck out of here. Next. Next. Right now.

1444
03:36:57,750 --> 03:37:07,370
I can't. I can't climb this. I mean, there are no bricks.

1445
03:37:09,209 --> 03:37:12,170
Is this guy home? I don't even know if this guy's home.

1446
03:37:12,889 --> 03:37:20,420
No, veto this one, too. That's what I get for reading fucking chat during something like that.

1447
03:37:21,620 --> 03:37:23,940
Tell me you guys say the funniest fucking shit, I swear to God.

1448
03:37:24,739 --> 03:37:28,299
Glacial crystals. I can't pick up more than one of these.

1449
03:37:33,239 --> 03:37:39,989
Skip terraria. Fine. That's some of my favorite means of travel. I'm glad you're bringing it up.

1450
03:37:40,870 --> 03:37:47,030
Red Dead Online with Vinny. But before we before we do that, I want to also say there's a game

1451
03:37:47,030 --> 03:37:51,670
called Rust that just implemented hot air balloons. Oh, God. Are you serious? Yes.

1452
03:37:52,549 --> 03:37:57,430
So many technical problems with this one. Let me give me one second. I have to say hello to

1453
03:37:57,430 --> 03:38:01,750
somebody. Somebody's knocked on my door. I got to say hello to them. Hold on. What? Hey, it's you

1454
03:38:01,750 --> 03:38:12,360
guys. It's my stream. My stream chat. I'm half expecting this to be. It's not. I just want to

1455
03:38:12,360 --> 03:38:18,040
say hello playing Red Dead Online Pog. That's up. The simple things make me fucking laugh.

1456
03:38:19,559 --> 03:38:23,899
How you doing? Oh, it's me, Elvis. Vinny Vinesauce.

1457
03:38:25,899 --> 03:38:31,100
My hair is fucking really good. That was really I just that was really good. I had to come back

1458
03:38:31,100 --> 03:38:35,659
and say that I'm half expecting this to be a skit. And you threw me all off. I had a fucking

1459
03:38:35,659 --> 03:38:44,100
clown here. Hit that sniper. Dude, that sniper is like going like this. What the hell is your

1460
03:38:44,100 --> 03:38:55,399
medic doing back here? Walk into it. Now, you lucky, rare, very rare, extraordinarily rare.

1461
03:38:55,399 --> 03:38:59,639
So if you're watching this right now, I am currently in North Carolina visiting my sister.

1462
03:39:00,360 --> 03:39:04,840
Some of you old subscribers will know that I do that every now and then. I think I went there

1463
03:39:04,840 --> 03:39:09,959
last time during Thanksgiving. What am I talking about? I'm in this. I'm what? What? I'm in the

1464
03:39:09,959 --> 03:39:16,489
same room that I was. Come here. Oh, this must be the scheduled upload. A scheduled upload.

1465
03:39:16,489 --> 03:39:20,010
It was a really good time. It's a really beautiful house. Really beautiful place down there in North

1466
03:39:20,010 --> 03:39:29,540
Carolina. Before he gets that stupid thing off, I'm supposed to hit him. I don't even tell you the

1467
03:39:29,540 --> 03:39:33,860
load that I'm using either. I'm using my sister doesn't live in North Carolina anymore. Regular,

1468
03:39:33,860 --> 03:39:39,819
just standard flamethrower and the power jack. We need to push this point. We need to get rid

1469
03:39:39,819 --> 03:39:45,479
of that sentry. Can we take it out? Can I get it right now? Come on. Keep messing with that engineer.

1470
03:39:45,479 --> 03:39:53,049
Yes. How did I not hit him with that? I'm not going to say anything, but it's open. No.

1471
03:39:54,950 --> 03:39:59,909
Get on zip point. Hello. There you go. What's going on, medic? Thank you for the heels.

1472
03:40:00,790 --> 03:40:12,649
Much appreciate. Damn it. Shouldn't have done that. Mr. Winslow. Getting out of here after this,

1473
03:40:12,649 --> 03:40:19,340
I think. I think I'm done after this one. That's not the case. You can't be AFK, man.

1474
03:40:19,340 --> 03:40:28,840
God, that like, I drank water went down into my lungs. I just like raised in water. Why?

1475
03:40:28,840 --> 03:40:44,250
What was that lag? Oh, man. Oh, I was just choked. Wow. I can't believe I actually killed that son

1476
03:40:44,250 --> 03:40:50,170
of a bitch. Get rid of that sentry. Come on. Yeah. Tan him again. Do it again. Keep messing

1477
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:56,250
with that engineer. Keep messing with him. Yes. What? I said a bad word. Need some help here.

1478
03:40:56,250 --> 03:41:00,329
This is post. Need some help here. Look, this is not the super meat boy playthrough. Get me out of

1479
03:41:00,329 --> 03:41:09,930
it. Damn it. I swore. Oh, heavies. It's in that cup. We got to get on that point. Big time. How

1480
03:41:09,930 --> 03:41:18,579
many sentries are over there? I'm going to go around the left side this time. No, no, no.

1481
03:41:19,350 --> 03:41:25,620
Where are you going? You're not going to. This guy's probably going to kill me. No, I'm going to miss,

1482
03:41:25,620 --> 03:41:33,479
but that's all right. Cause he's where is he? Where the hell does this guy go? I'll find you.

1483
03:41:33,479 --> 03:41:41,129
And when I find you, you're going to get your, your face ripped off. I'll take it. I'll take it.

1484
03:41:41,129 --> 03:41:47,579
How can I not hit the guy that's standing still? Why am I so red? Why are they both doing that?

1485
03:41:47,579 --> 03:41:56,489
Why are they both doing this? Fucking red. How many is it going to take to kill this son of a.

1486
03:41:56,489 --> 03:42:08,340
All right. Fine. I'll just smash you. You want to get smashed? Oh my God. That was terrifying.

1487
03:42:11,739 --> 03:42:18,549
Didn't even need to hit him. We're going to lose. Come on. I think I look better now.

1488
03:42:18,549 --> 03:42:23,799
Give me those heels. Just being honest. Turn around. Turn around, man. I got to try and kill

1489
03:42:23,799 --> 03:42:31,979
that engineer. That's what I wanted. Get him. Hit him. I'm trying to wait for him just to come

1490
03:42:31,979 --> 03:42:36,870
across the middle. It's a different person. This is not good. We're so dead. This is what happens

1491
03:42:36,870 --> 03:42:42,899
when you age. We're so dead. Like seven or eight years. Wait. Demoman, go. Quickly. Quickly.

1492
03:42:42,899 --> 03:42:44,819
Quickly. Quickly. Quick. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1493
03:42:44,819 --> 03:42:52,790
This is called aging. Can I get there in 15 seconds? I don't think I'm going to be able to

1494
03:42:52,790 --> 03:43:00,889
get there in 15 seconds. This is seven years ago? What was it exactly? 2011? 2012? What? What? What

1495
03:43:00,889 --> 03:43:09,940
on earth? 2013 maybe? Pops? I landed on top of that guy's head. 2012. This is eight years ago.

1496
03:43:11,780 --> 03:43:16,100
Okay. That's the first time that's ever happened to me. Imagine if I had the man

1497
03:43:16,100 --> 03:43:21,260
treads on. That guy would have been tumor stomped. It's a defense. It looks like a little bit of a

1498
03:43:21,260 --> 03:43:29,420
defense. Nice sentry. Very good start. Sniper. Trying to shoot me in my face. Was I like a

1499
03:43:29,420 --> 03:43:34,950
jacked fuck at this point? Yeah, I was. Maybe he is. Look at the shoulder. Look at the chest.

1500
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:39,030
I got to get behind him. If I stood up right now, people would just fucking fuck. Somebody just come

1501
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:50,819
here. Two scouts. I'll wrap around you. Yeah. Give me a heal, man. I need a heal. Need a heal.

1502
03:43:50,819 --> 03:43:55,979
The old German would beat your ass. No, he wouldn't. You are a jumpy little freak. Because the

1503
03:43:55,979 --> 03:44:01,590
new German would run. Close him in here. Close him in big time. No, no, no. Don't think that

1504
03:44:01,590 --> 03:44:09,579
would happen. Everybody get blown out. This guy's got crits. I'm trying to blow people out. Oh,

1505
03:44:09,579 --> 03:44:19,110
run. Get him. Please. Please die. We're going to do 10 in a row. He's still alive. Five seconds

1506
03:44:19,110 --> 03:44:28,739
each. Oh, no. He died that far. That long after I shot him. It's felt like 20 minutes. This is a

1507
03:44:28,739 --> 03:44:35,239
10 minute video. By the way, this is a 10 minute video before doing a 10 minute video. People did

1508
03:44:35,239 --> 03:44:40,280
to game the fucking YouTube ad system. So don't look at that and be like, oh, what a dickhead.

1509
03:44:40,280 --> 03:44:45,079
He's got 10 minutes to get like the four ads. So this is 2012, dude. This is like before ads

1510
03:44:45,079 --> 03:44:56,389
even fucking existed. That medic is just standing back there. Oh, my God. That's the second sick

1511
03:44:56,389 --> 03:45:03,479
shot of the day. Wrap it up and give it to me for Christmas. Get away from the sentry. Get this

1512
03:45:03,479 --> 03:45:07,879
stuff away from the sentry. I got you. Don't worry, buddy. I got you. I was pretty good. I got you.

1513
03:45:07,879 --> 03:45:13,340
I was pretty good. What's next? Well, that's going to be plenty of that. Family feud. This is just

1514
03:45:13,340 --> 03:45:19,479
the shitty family feud. Who's going to play this? I'm going to try to win a game. Get fucking wasted.

1515
03:45:19,479 --> 03:45:30,409
No, no, just to have to get yourself small cup. Put in like 5% vodka and 95% cranberry juice.

1516
03:45:33,379 --> 03:45:39,399
Oh, Merry Christmas. Super spectacular. Which one of these games? Are you guys ready? Here's

1517
03:45:39,399 --> 03:45:49,159
the game of the night. Which one of these games? The only one cost money. One of these 41 games

1518
03:45:49,159 --> 03:45:57,319
was one dollar. Which one is it? Black and white. Part two. Yes. Let's go.

1519
03:46:05,510 --> 03:46:11,879
Where is Murius? I just want to see Murius's face once and I'll skip. All right. Let's see what

1520
03:46:11,879 --> 03:46:19,959
happens. Do they grow? How are we doing over here? I just want to see Murius's face. That's it. That's

1521
03:46:19,959 --> 03:46:24,659
all I care about. No one's even started building this yet. Where is everybody? This is part two.

1522
03:46:24,659 --> 03:46:30,100
We're not going to see him. Somebody build this. Why not? Yes, we will. All right. Jeff Keeley

1523
03:46:30,899 --> 03:46:38,569
build this. You're going to do it now. He was captured. Oh, no, that's right. He was being

1524
03:46:38,569 --> 03:46:48,569
tortured. Let's try to get another one. The Beagle boss here somewhere. Not going to get away.

1525
03:46:48,569 --> 03:46:55,260
Tokyo jungle. This game was really fun. Yep. Oblivion's on the first year of law school.

1526
03:46:59,129 --> 03:47:03,299
I'll hit you up eventually if I ever need you, you know, right? I'm a lawyer in chat.

1527
03:47:03,299 --> 03:47:11,129
You always got to have a good lawyer. Happiness being spread, tearing entire family apart.

1528
03:47:18,250 --> 03:47:26,059
Don't do it. You'll have to apologize if I do it. Oh, I'll do it. I'll do it. Do it.

1529
03:47:30,629 --> 03:47:35,190
This game is a really fun game. This is all just I wish that somebody like a AAA studio would make

1530
03:47:35,190 --> 03:47:39,670
this game. Plus, I keep the level has like 5000 hours to it. That's a good thing. And I keep the

1531
03:47:39,670 --> 03:47:50,979
moves. Monster Ranger. Oh, my goodness. Not good. You would play it again. I already beat it. And

1532
03:47:50,979 --> 03:47:58,700
I beat the whole game. I always got the stupid thing. Yep. Quest. Okay, marketing. It's five.

1533
03:47:59,659 --> 03:48:10,280
Okay. That's that's going to be the the one gas station. This game is so bad.

1534
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:18,360
Yeah, you know, we got our fill in this game after about two hours, three hours. Excellent.

1535
03:48:19,399 --> 03:48:25,379
What do you mean? Wink Winks? They're not even possible to redeem. I want like a different

1536
03:48:25,379 --> 03:48:34,920
rifle. Maybe I shouldn't have spent all my money on fish. Get the buffet at the Golden Corral.

1537
03:48:34,920 --> 03:48:39,079
When I went yesterday with some other beers, I got a pile of fried chicken. But when I went to

1538
03:48:39,079 --> 03:48:48,379
go for the smiley face fries, I couldn't find any. Oh, here comes a complaint. I kind of just

1539
03:48:48,379 --> 03:49:09,500
try it. It's a cool way to switch. No complaint. That's great. On this game. But I need to charge

1540
03:49:09,500 --> 03:49:14,540
Community Isaac mod. I don't have any money. Anti birth. When did I do this? I'm gonna leave

1541
03:49:14,540 --> 03:49:20,969
it there for now. Who knows the hell that is? I've been around for so long that I did not play this

1542
03:49:20,969 --> 03:49:26,020
game. I did not play this. I didn't play this. Yeah, I used it. It didn't do anything. I've

1543
03:49:26,020 --> 03:49:31,379
been doing this shit for fucking almost 10 years. I did not play anti birth on stream. There's no

1544
03:49:31,379 --> 03:49:38,100
fucking way that I did. I want to play this right now. Blank card card. I want to play this right

1545
03:49:38,100 --> 03:49:51,719
now. Who knows this game? Okay, I'm gonna make a statement here that a lot of people may disagree

1546
03:49:51,719 --> 03:49:55,719
with and they might agree with. Here's the statement. Don't be so hard on yourself. You're

1547
03:49:55,719 --> 03:50:03,559
not gonna die right here. The Binding of Isaac might be within the top 10 of my favorite games

1548
03:50:03,559 --> 03:50:09,979
ever made. I think it might even be it could be top five of like the one of the most fun games

1549
03:50:09,979 --> 03:50:18,600
ever played. This is what I'd make that judgment based on how much time I have in a game. I

1550
03:50:20,069 --> 03:50:24,950
have put so many hours into this game. I love this game so much. I have like probably hundreds and

1551
03:50:24,950 --> 03:50:30,540
hundreds and hundreds maybe even a thousand hours in Binding of Isaac. I was gonna buy a heart but

1552
03:50:30,540 --> 03:50:35,260
you only do that with something that you just love and think it's so much fun. That'd be dumb.

1553
03:50:35,260 --> 03:50:40,420
Should I like start this again and play this again? I feel like this would be a lot of fun to do and

1554
03:50:40,420 --> 03:50:50,229
like not do it for like two hours. I actually played this game for like six to eight hours in

1555
03:50:50,229 --> 03:50:55,750
a stream. I just hit him with a tomato. He should have been vulnerable. It's career suicide. Why?

1556
03:50:55,750 --> 03:51:14,950
What? It's Binding of Isaac. Everybody loves Binding of Isaac. Skip. Skip. Stream in the corner.

1557
03:51:18,069 --> 03:51:32,790
How did we get this again? Am I playing this? Okay. Vampyr. Game sucks. Sounds pretty good.

1558
03:51:32,790 --> 03:51:41,989
And lastly, spooky things. All right. Now, uh, Jerma, as this is your show, would you like to

1559
03:51:41,989 --> 03:51:48,329
kick us off here? I'm gonna go first. You do? All right. Well, I think I'll take 17th century

1560
03:51:48,329 --> 03:51:55,930
poetry for 50, please. All right. Let's uh, let's see what we got here. Extend. John Calvin crafted

1561
03:51:55,930 --> 03:52:01,209
this Christian ideology ideology stressing God's power. I'm not gonna watch this whole thing. It's

1562
03:52:01,209 --> 03:52:14,459
like three and a half hour, four hour stream. Uh, what is, um, you got anything? Dr. Strange? Uh,

1563
03:52:14,459 --> 03:52:21,659
I have no idea. I put face cam on for this. It actually is.

1564
03:52:26,100 --> 03:52:27,700
Why don't I have face cam on for Sam and Mac?

1565
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:38,500
Got it. The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance. Whoa. We're not going to do that.

1566
03:52:38,500 --> 03:52:46,500
We're not going to do that. That's like a spoiler. No, I don't think it's going to happen again.

1567
03:52:50,659 --> 03:52:55,059
This is like the, what the last level. There's no way it's going to happen again. All right. Two more.

1568
03:52:56,500 --> 03:52:59,379
I'm going to let, no, three more. And the third one is going to play to zero.

1569
03:53:00,340 --> 03:53:22,569
And that's it. And I'll see you tomorrow. One, two, three. No way, right? That's not actually

1570
03:53:22,569 --> 03:53:39,180
going to happen. Is it? Now what do I do? Okay. That should be enough for now that I can't believe

1571
03:53:39,180 --> 03:53:48,840
this. It was meant to be the Nintendo Labo. Nemo Slack. So this goes underneath in here.

1572
03:53:48,840 --> 03:54:00,469
Eight and a half hours. Bye, bye, bye, bye. And then up the hole. Why am I up there? Slide

1573
03:54:00,469 --> 03:54:10,579
the end of the spring through the eyelet from underneath. What the fuck are you doing? Oh,

1574
03:54:10,579 --> 03:54:14,659
that's right. I remember this. Everyone was talking about like my penis and shit. And I,

1575
03:54:14,659 --> 03:54:18,180
I put like a trash bag on my pants because people were talking about like my dick and stuff, right?

1576
03:54:18,180 --> 03:54:22,500
Like, I remember this. I've no, I remember this. Yeah. People were like fucking being chat was

1577
03:54:22,500 --> 03:54:30,299
like all fucked up tonight. Slots on the ocean. What the fuck? Yeah. I put like a plastic bag diaper

1578
03:54:30,299 --> 03:54:37,540
on because people wouldn't shut up about it. I remember this wrong way. What do you mean wrong

1579
03:54:37,540 --> 03:54:49,270
way? That's not the wrong way. This is the right way. This was so much fun. Thank you for watching

1580
03:54:49,270 --> 03:54:52,389
everybody. This we're going to, we're going to, we'll hang out and do the bits and subs and

1581
03:54:52,389 --> 03:55:00,549
everything. But this is very much a very impromptu. This is crazy. I didn't know I was doing this until

1582
03:55:00,549 --> 03:55:10,700
this is going to be an actually functioning fishing rod. No, thanks for watching. Thanks for joining

1583
03:55:10,700 --> 03:55:15,979
me. See, look at the rubber bands. All right. We're going to let it one more. I'm going to click

1584
03:55:15,979 --> 03:55:25,690
it five times in a row hysterical things that happened in this shit. This is like, if you,

1585
03:55:25,690 --> 03:55:29,530
if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.

1586
03:55:29,530 --> 03:55:34,010
What the heck? All right. It's time for some QWOP.

1587
03:55:39,379 --> 03:55:46,260
So what was my final death count? 25. Oh God. Wait, does it say? No, they've been counting in

1588
03:55:46,260 --> 03:55:53,879
the stream. I'm just looking over and glancing over and seeing. All right. Thanks a lot for playing

1589
03:55:53,879 --> 03:55:58,840
guys. If you played, I'll probably do this again. This was actually pretty damn fun. So thanks for

1590
03:55:58,840 --> 03:56:05,100
coming. If you joined into the game, into the session. So now we're going to play some QWOP.

1591
03:56:05,100 --> 03:56:16,059
And yeah, thanks so much guys. We're going to play. Oh, that was a shot in the face.

1592
03:56:16,059 --> 03:56:22,250
Pull up. How do I get out of here? All right. It's going to be a black screen until I get

1593
03:56:22,250 --> 03:56:35,350
QWOP loaded. Q W O P. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. Hey, yo, I love Liberty City. This is ancient.

1594
03:56:35,989 --> 03:56:43,620
This might be one of the oldest things. QWOP is a flash game. It's a flash game where you

1595
03:56:43,620 --> 03:56:50,180
have to use QW and then O P to run. And it is incredibly difficult. Is this the first stream?

1596
03:56:50,180 --> 03:56:53,940
The screen's probably not going to go black. It's probably going to be just my background.

1597
03:56:53,940 --> 03:57:00,709
This has to be one of them. Just my desktop background. I still have that background. All

1598
03:57:00,709 --> 03:57:12,860
right. Let me pull up some QWOP. Let me make sure the stream thing is there. And people think I'm

1599
03:57:12,860 --> 03:57:23,430
bullshit. Oh man, that was funny. I'm bullshit. That was so damn funny. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP.

1600
03:57:23,430 --> 03:57:31,260
Dermot, that's a lie. Is it? Why do you think about this? Oh, no, nevermind. I can't do this.

1601
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:37,959
I got to think about this. I tried to queue it up. Good thing we didn't get to see QWOP.

1602
03:57:37,959 --> 03:57:55,860
Cuphead. No. Skip. Skip. Skip. Skip. Unrailed. Skip. Demon souls. Part one. Skip. This is

1603
03:57:55,940 --> 03:58:02,069
scary pictures. Activity book. Skip. Earth Defense Force. Skip. Dark Souls. Ring City DLC. Skip.

1604
03:58:02,069 --> 03:58:09,450
Boost game. Skip. Mind Show. All right. So, you know, when words just come out, but they mean

1605
03:58:09,450 --> 03:58:17,559
absolutely nothing. Words were just coming out of my mouth and they meant nothing. It was just

1606
03:58:17,559 --> 03:58:23,000
word swoop. It didn't mean anything. It wasn't going anywhere. It was just, it was a run on sentence.

1607
03:58:38,100 --> 03:58:46,040
That's the penis music thing. That's the penis music gift. Hold on. What are you talking about?

1608
03:58:46,040 --> 03:58:55,690
Isn't it? What? Hold on. Ready? Like, holy shit. It actually is. That's not synced.

1609
03:58:58,440 --> 03:59:02,659
Somebody linked up. What a great thing to end on. Game audio. That shouldn't be a thing.

1610
03:59:05,540 --> 03:59:13,190
Video has desync. All right. But how about how much? All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1611
03:59:17,260 --> 03:59:27,030
Technical difficulties. All right. Thanks for watching, everybody. Seriously.

1612
03:59:28,069 --> 03:59:37,579
It was a wild night. Is Vinnie streaming right now? Because I did say that was going to happen

1613
03:59:37,579 --> 03:59:42,649
because it was part of... Okay. All right. We're going to raid Vinnie because it was part of the...

1614
03:59:43,770 --> 03:59:52,760
I did say it in one of the clips, so that's what we have to do. Anyways, let's go back.

1615
03:59:53,399 --> 04:00:00,139
Too early. Thanks for watching. Join us tomorrow. Ooh. Ow. I was a little too close. I got to back

1616
04:00:00,139 --> 04:00:09,430
up. Oh, fuck my hand. God damn it. I got to get a new mic set up. It's fucking freaking me out.

1617
04:00:15,370 --> 04:00:22,469
Okay. So let's, let's go back to earlier today. If you join us for community content night,

1618
04:00:24,180 --> 04:00:30,069
we've got two... We're just hanging out streams in a row. Community content night is people,

1619
04:00:30,069 --> 04:00:34,709
artwork, and videos that people have made based around stuff on the streams and community and

1620
04:00:34,709 --> 04:00:43,129
everything. So it's a good time. I will see you tomorrow. If you're taking off, if you're sticking

1621
04:00:43,129 --> 04:00:47,049
around for a little bit, we'll go over some of these things. I do the bits and the subs and

1622
04:00:47,049 --> 04:00:54,819
everything at the end of a stream. If you are a new viewer. And right now we're going to talk about

1623
04:00:54,819 --> 04:01:05,420
it. Uh, Freddy Dread, $500. Five fucking hundred dollars. That was within 10 minutes of the stream

1624
04:01:05,420 --> 04:01:15,639
starting, which is insane. Thank you, Freddy, for your five hundred fucking bucks and a hundred

1625
04:01:15,639 --> 04:01:23,879
community subs right after that, which is insane. Mitchell, thanks for the thousand bits. I wish I

1626
04:01:23,879 --> 04:01:27,000
had a hundred dollars to give you tonight, partially because you're a huge inspiration,

1627
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:32,489
an awesome content creator, but also for that amazing Mario Kart rant in the first Sunshine

1628
04:01:32,489 --> 04:01:36,250
VOD. I would pay money to listen to you instead of just sitting in a room ripping bad games,

1629
04:01:36,250 --> 04:01:49,290
a new asshole. No, but here comes a new podcast. No, this is, this is a podcast. It's everything.

1630
04:01:49,290 --> 04:01:53,979
You know what I mean? It could be whatever the fuck we want. Sometimes the stream just stops

1631
04:01:53,979 --> 04:02:00,229
and for 20 straight minutes, we just talk about random shit. So I don't need to do a podcast

1632
04:02:00,229 --> 04:02:08,360
because this stream is such an erratic fucking mess that it just happens sometimes anyway.

1633
04:02:08,360 --> 04:02:17,500
But thank you for the 10 bucks. Goobery Juice, thanks for 250. Jerma Grin, thanks a lot.

1634
04:02:18,870 --> 04:02:23,110
Peaceful Haley, 250. Jeremy, I rated you at the beginning of the stream with 13 viewers and now

1635
04:02:23,110 --> 04:02:30,219
I feel stupid. And I mean, it's literally just your viewers anyway. Never again. That's all right.

1636
04:02:30,219 --> 04:02:38,680
Don't worry. Hey, 13. That's still people. That's still a lot of people. 10 people is a lot of

1637
04:02:38,680 --> 04:02:43,159
people. 100 people is a lot of people. Thousand people is a lot of people. That's fine. Don't

1638
04:02:43,159 --> 04:02:55,559
worry. Don't worry about that. Thanks for doing that. Hey, but more importantly, they were watching

1639
04:02:55,559 --> 04:03:04,549
you, not me. So give yourself a little bit of credit, right? And Anonymous Cheerer, thanks for

1640
04:03:04,549 --> 04:03:11,620
the thousand bits. No message, just a thousand bits. Foxy Grandpa, thanks for the five dollars.

1641
04:03:11,620 --> 04:03:19,459
No message. Back to back, no message, but just lots of money. Edmund Hakari, thanks for the five

1642
04:03:19,459 --> 04:03:24,260
dollars. Watching you melt the lines of old Jerma while pretending it was you was way funnier than

1643
04:03:24,260 --> 04:03:36,260
it should have been. And I thought it would be. 10 out of 10 meta stream. Hey, Icarus Gamers,

1644
04:03:36,260 --> 04:03:40,620
thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, I had a weird dream with you in it last night. More dreams.

1645
04:03:40,620 --> 04:03:45,020
You were in a play that was like Clue, where it was a murder mystery, but there was a different

1646
04:03:45,020 --> 04:03:51,370
murderer every time. But it was also competitive. So the actors were competing to get to be the

1647
04:03:51,370 --> 04:03:56,309
murderer. I was hanging out with you backstage and you're about to go to be the murderer,

1648
04:03:56,309 --> 04:04:02,409
but someone else did it first and you got wicked mad, like absolutely seething anger that you got

1649
04:04:02,409 --> 04:04:17,260
kill stole. It was really funny. Add it to the list of Jerma is a psychopath in your dreams.

1650
04:04:17,260 --> 04:04:21,989
Hey, Yenwen, thanks a lot for the 250. They say, hey, Jerma, do you know it's been over a year since

1651
04:04:21,989 --> 04:04:28,100
I sent you my first piece of artwork? Long time. It's pretty crazy when I think back on it,

1652
04:04:28,100 --> 04:04:32,379
especially since that drawing was never intentional. It was a random sketch that

1653
04:04:32,379 --> 04:04:38,219
turned into a fully fledged painting. During the past year, I resigned from being a bartender and

1654
04:04:38,219 --> 04:04:42,549
had begun training as a teacher. I'm really busy and need to go to bed early, so I haven't been

1655
04:04:42,549 --> 04:04:48,280
able to catch many streams nor draw anything serious. Thanks for joining the stream today,

1656
04:04:48,280 --> 04:04:53,620
as well as everyone from the pre-stream chat. It was a lot of fun. Here is the finished image

1657
04:04:53,620 --> 04:05:03,459
that I was working on. Let's put it on screen. If you don't know, Yenwen is an insanely talented

1658
04:05:03,459 --> 04:05:10,229
artist. Some of the most ridiculous paintings we've ever seen have come from Yenwen. I know

1659
04:05:10,790 --> 04:05:31,770
people probably have links of some of the insane shit. How do I save this? Am I this dumb? I don't

1660
04:05:31,770 --> 04:05:45,829
know how to save a photo. Oh, there we go. That was not it. Oh, yes, it was. Yes, it was. It's just

1661
04:05:45,829 --> 04:06:05,620
very high resolution. I was like, wait, it's gray. There we go. Why does Jax have to be so much bigger

1662
04:06:05,620 --> 04:06:16,180
than me? We're the same size. One of them's just smarter in video game knowledge. Thanks a lot,

1663
04:06:16,180 --> 04:06:29,510
Yenwen. This is good shit, as always. This is a big brother reveal. Thank you. It means a lot.

1664
04:06:33,290 --> 04:06:43,700
More great artwork from Yenwen. Goiki gave $50, 5000 bits. We did it, boys. This has me crying.

1665
04:06:44,260 --> 04:06:49,639
Thank you, Goiki. I'm not sure exactly what you were referring to, but I missed your $50,

1666
04:06:50,440 --> 04:06:59,290
and I want to make sure that I did touch upon it. So thank you. Hey, Razlik. Thanks, Razlik,

1667
04:06:59,290 --> 04:07:04,420
for the $5. Dermot, I've been rather ill for the past two months. Watching your streams and videos

1668
04:07:04,420 --> 04:07:10,229
helps me out so much on them sleepless nights. Thank you and much love to you in this community.

1669
04:07:10,790 --> 04:07:15,590
Such a wonderful place. Also, it's my wonderful Scottish friend's birthday today.

1670
04:07:16,229 --> 04:07:23,979
DK. If you could wish him a happy birthday, it'd be awesome. Hey, DK, have a fucking fantastic

1671
04:07:23,979 --> 04:07:37,770
birthday. Happy birthday, DK. Thanks a lot, Razlik. Pifflavor, thanks for the thousand bits. $10.

1672
04:07:38,409 --> 04:07:43,190
Not going to lie, these streams recently have been very epic, in my opinion. Thanks for that.

1673
04:07:44,149 --> 04:07:47,670
I've laughed this much in a while. Also, even though you have so many games on the list,

1674
04:07:48,389 --> 04:07:56,149
play Dead Space. Probably this Halloween. This October, I'll probably do at least one or two of

1675
04:07:56,149 --> 04:08:00,389
the Dead Spaces in a row. That's a Halloween stream. You know what I mean? That's a Halloween

1676
04:08:00,389 --> 04:08:06,920
time stream. Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50. This stream reminds me of the part in...

1677
04:08:09,780 --> 04:08:14,260
There's a spoiler for a movie. I'm not going to read it because I've got spoilers for a movie,

1678
04:08:14,899 --> 04:08:22,549
and I haven't seen that movie, so I'm not going to read it. Thanks, Gnarly, for the $2.50.

1679
04:08:24,889 --> 04:08:35,340
And then we had 500 community subs from MrGerma985, so thanks, whoever you are.

1680
04:08:35,340 --> 04:08:46,069
Thanks a lot, Germa. What a guy. When the stream is over, I'm going to have to go into my PayPal

1681
04:08:46,069 --> 04:08:51,719
account and turn off and check the fraud department and make sure they know that this is real.

1682
04:08:51,719 --> 04:09:02,459
I can do that right away. But in the middle of that, Goiki gave 20, Austin Atlantis gave 100,

1683
04:09:03,030 --> 04:09:08,840
Abe Cashim gave 100. So there were 200 community fucking subs that were added to that,

1684
04:09:08,840 --> 04:09:15,819
besides my little bet bingo with you guys. So thanks to Austin and to Abe for giving 200

1685
04:09:15,819 --> 04:09:21,020
fucking subs. That's a shitload, and you never expected to give that much money. He's going to

1686
04:09:21,020 --> 04:09:30,420
charge them back. No, I'm not. AveryDropDead gave five. Thank you. RobbieRevolver gave

1687
04:09:30,420 --> 04:09:35,020
a thousand bits. $10. Germa, thank you to you and your team for putting this event together.

1688
04:09:35,020 --> 04:09:38,459
It was fun, and this is why we love you. Looking forward to more creative events in the future.

1689
04:09:42,870 --> 04:09:49,299
This was just lazy Luke just threw this together and not even day. We were jokingly talking about

1690
04:09:49,299 --> 04:09:53,780
this fucking two days ago, and it was just like, oh, hey, by the way, you can just use it now and

1691
04:09:53,780 --> 04:10:03,979
it works flawlessly. By the way, flawlessly. It was not a single problem. Not a single hiccup.

1692
04:10:03,979 --> 04:10:11,579
It's not like, oh, it crashed. We reloaded. Shit worked fucking flawlessly. Everybody thank Lazy

1693
04:10:11,579 --> 04:10:18,680
Luke for throwing together just a goofy idea that we had in this pre-stream chat two days ago

1694
04:10:18,680 --> 04:10:31,299
and made it reality. That's what you should be thanking. But thank you Captain Nemo for the 300

1695
04:10:31,299 --> 04:10:35,819
bits. Germa, you should see if you can leave the random bot running when stream is offline so the

1696
04:10:35,819 --> 04:10:41,450
chat and stream can just be bopping constantly. Even if you aren't around. Well, you guys can

1697
04:10:41,450 --> 04:10:49,959
just use it. It's available at Germa.org slash random. You can just play with it right now.

1698
04:10:49,959 --> 04:10:58,540
That's not an exclusive thing to me. It just pulls data from YouTube and Twitch and everything. So

1699
04:10:58,540 --> 04:11:06,409
you can just play with it if you want. It's a really neat little tool. We are going to put

1700
04:11:06,409 --> 04:11:10,729
the subs on stream and it's going to be very, very, very, very ridiculous. This is going to

1701
04:11:10,729 --> 04:11:18,389
be very fast because I mean, I, I stacked the deck a little bit with 500, but there was still,

1702
04:11:18,389 --> 04:11:26,260
no, we're not doing mind show. That was the wrong, sorry, wrong scene. Sorry about that.

1703
04:11:26,260 --> 04:11:36,739
We're going this way. Although I may have stacked the deck, it still doesn't matter.

1704
04:11:36,739 --> 04:11:44,100
It was fucking hundreds and hundreds of community subs from other, other people like Freddy Dread,

1705
04:11:44,180 --> 04:11:51,479
Abe. There was a thousand fucking subs tonight. So let me get the credits rolling. This is going to

1706
04:11:51,479 --> 04:11:59,979
blow by pretty quickly. Let's see just how fast this goes. I wonder if you're able to even read

1707
04:11:59,979 --> 04:12:16,440
one name in three, two, one, roll them. Oh boy. Nope. Don't think so. Thanks guys. That's a lot

1708
04:12:16,440 --> 04:12:30,020
of people. That's probably more than a thousand today. Jesus. We also had blueberry juice 250.

1709
04:12:30,020 --> 04:12:36,329
Please set it to change every one second. Please. I'm not sure that it could even handle one second

1710
04:12:36,329 --> 04:12:45,219
changes. What's the sub count now? Uh, let's see, let's after tonight, let's see what it is.

1711
04:12:45,219 --> 04:13:02,979
The current sub count right now after today's insanity is 8,500 subs, 85, 81 to be exact after

1712
04:13:02,979 --> 04:13:09,219
today. So take away my 500, which we're just, you know, if you want to talk about stacking the deck,

1713
04:13:09,219 --> 04:13:31,879
so over 8,000, which is fucking crazy and still no new emotes. I know I'm fucking terrible, but

1714
04:13:32,520 --> 04:13:39,909
anyways, uh, it's still about four or five bits left to do. Uh, we have thick neck. Baby gave

1715
04:13:39,909 --> 04:13:47,350
1500 bits, 15 bucks, no message, just a bunch of money that they just slapped onto the stream.

1716
04:13:47,350 --> 04:13:56,409
Thank you. Uh, did we get Mr. Dask? Mr. Dask gave $10,000 bits to no message either. Thank you. Mr.

1717
04:13:56,409 --> 04:14:02,579
Dask Avery drop dead. $5 got home from work early and was able to catch all this amazing stream.

1718
04:14:02,579 --> 04:14:09,719
Thanks to him of being the best guy on Twitch. You're awesome. I'm glad you think that way.

1719
04:14:12,219 --> 04:14:21,610
Thank you. Thanks for saying that. I, that's all I can say. Shout out to the stream archive people.

1720
04:14:21,610 --> 04:14:29,190
That's correct. If the stream archive was not saving and uploading every single VOD ever,

1721
04:14:29,190 --> 04:14:37,000
this also doesn't happen. So huge shout out to the stream archive guys. I'm talking about hundreds

1722
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:49,239
and hundreds, like 700 fucking uploads, 750 uploads. So thank them too. Uh, Violet Wanderer

1723
04:14:49,239 --> 04:14:55,129
$5. I've got like 700 hours in Binding of Isaac Rebirth. It's one of my favorites too. When is,

1724
04:14:56,229 --> 04:15:01,500
um, what's the new one coming out? Like Redemption or something? It hasn't been a new,

1725
04:15:03,270 --> 04:15:07,450
aren't they taking the anti-birth mod and making it a thing? They're officially putting it in the

1726
04:15:07,450 --> 04:15:16,739
game. What's it called? Like Repentance or something? Yeah, they're adding a final expansion. Repentance.

1727
04:15:16,739 --> 04:15:20,899
Well, when that comes, maybe when that comes out, I'll get back into Binding of Isaac on stream.

1728
04:15:20,899 --> 04:15:27,860
That sounds like a good time to start getting back into it. That sounds like a plan.

1729
04:15:31,430 --> 04:15:39,450
Thank you for the $5. Uh, Pink Karoo, thanks for the $5. Presto Extendo. Thank you.

1730
04:15:40,899 --> 04:15:45,700
Roguy, thanks for the $3. Bro, I finally saved up enough channel points to do a wink on Friday,

1731
04:15:45,700 --> 04:15:50,760
but I didn't do it because you already had face cam on. Now you disable wink. Please accept this

1732
04:15:50,760 --> 04:15:55,780
as entry into the Wink Club. Well, it's funny you bring that up because tomorrow,

1733
04:15:55,780 --> 04:16:03,139
on the stream tomorrow, Winks come back at an insanely discounted price. So you'll have a

1734
04:16:03,139 --> 04:16:18,520
chance to do it tomorrow. What's the price? We'll see. We'll see tomorrow. And then finally Rad,

1735
04:16:18,520 --> 04:16:22,920
Radshly, thanks for the $3. Free dolls. I'm going to be starting my new job next week,

1736
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:26,920
so I won't be able to catch streams as often. Thank you for all the laughs these past few months.

1737
04:16:27,719 --> 04:16:35,079
Thanks for watching the past few months. Eh, community doesn't exist. Community doesn't exist,

1738
04:16:35,079 --> 04:16:41,420
but I love the people in the fucking community. So thanks for participating. This whole thing is

1739
04:16:41,420 --> 04:16:47,340
impossible without all of you. So thanks for watching. See you tomorrow for Community

1740
04:16:47,340 --> 04:16:55,209
Content Night. Take care. We are going to raid Vinny because obviously I said it earlier,

1741
04:16:55,209 --> 04:17:05,559
so you know, it's part of the deal. Go tell Vinny what's going to say something. See you guys

1742
04:17:05,559 --> 04:17:14,620
tomorrow. Take care. Good night. Thanks for experimenting in this experimental stream,

1743
04:17:15,260 --> 04:17:24,020
and we'll see you tomorrow. Good night, guys. See you soon.
