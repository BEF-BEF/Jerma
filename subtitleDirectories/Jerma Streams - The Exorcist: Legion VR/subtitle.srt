he came in the room

483
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:41,420
I heard him barking at the door

484
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:43,420
and I opened the door and he was sitting there wagging his tail

485
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:45,420
I'm like yeah what do you want

486
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:47,420

and I close the door and he just lies in the corner

488
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:51,420
all the way right next to the door

489
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:53,779

490
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:55,779

02:04:19,579 --> 02:04:23,350
he just sits in the corner

495
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:26,039
like I'm not ever gonna go over there

496
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:28,039
he knows he's like yeah I'm just gonna sit

497
02:04:28,039 --> 02:04:34,949
right in front of the door

498
02:04:34,949 --> 02:04:38,090

499
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:40,090
he's just like I'm just gonna hang out

500
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:47,000
I just don't want to step on him

501
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
you know what I mean

502
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,689

503
02:04:51,689 --> 02:04:58,729

509
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:28,859
this is the weirdest thing

510
02:05:28,859 --> 02:05:30,859

511
02:05:30,859 --> 02:05:32,859
GPS

512
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,859

524
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:42,010
and it'll clean out the pipes man

I don't, I don't know what that is

532
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:17,819
because it's in this room

533
02:07:17,819 --> 02:07:20,310
and looks like when you get

534
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:39,189
a zombie thing or whatever

535
02:07:39,189 --> 02:07:45,020

538
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:52,020

539
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:56,119

546
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,840
he's like, I can't, what's wrong with this thing man

547
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,840
I can't break it either, it's some fucking bullshit

548
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:44,229

549
02:08:44,229 --> 02:08:46,229

550
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:48,229

553
02:09:01,779 --> 02:09:12,199

02:09:18,659 --> 02:09:25,369

02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:58,780
Gollum

02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:01,530

701
02:27:41,079 --> 02:27:43,639

816
02:37:12,819 --> 02:37:32,090
okay, I didn't

817
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:34,090
below ground, the Haitian army found me a day

818
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:40,100
later among the corpses of Dr. Hopkins

819
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:42,100
I made it to the airport without too many questions

820
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:48,500
these demonic encounters have left me

821
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:50,500
with a strange sensation

822
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:52,500
as if I am being led towards an inevitable

823
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:54,500
confrontation

824
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:58,020
Azuzu's presence

825
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:02,500
auto check

826
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:15,030
hang it up

827
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:18,229
oh, this is a tape

828
02:38:18,229 --> 02:38:21,620
Hampshire

829
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:26,860
ooh

830
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:28,860
one of our inmates attacked and almost killed a police officer

831
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:31,290
Detective Jameson

832
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:33,290
how in critical condition

833
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:35,659
lacerations to the throat and neck

834
02:38:35,659 --> 02:38:37,659
inmate widely known as

835
02:38:37,659 --> 02:38:39,659
the Gemini copycat killer

836
02:38:39,659 --> 02:38:41,659
on life three days after the attack

837
02:38:41,659 --> 02:38:44,149
back on

838
02:38:44,149 --> 02:38:50,549
Detective Jameson

839
02:38:50,549 --> 02:38:55,420
final chapter

840
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:59,190
why don't we take a look and see how well we did so far

841
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:03,799
75% that's a C

842
02:39:03,799 --> 02:39:06,170
I didn't do the artifact

843
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:08,170
I didn't understand that

844
02:39:08,170 --> 02:39:11,030
I was learning the game and I got my ass kicked

845
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:15,319
100%

846
02:39:15,319 --> 02:39:19,399
I did pretty good on this one

847
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:21,399
100% on the baby one

848
02:39:21,399 --> 02:39:23,829
and 25%

849
02:39:23,829 --> 02:39:25,829
why was that so bad

850
02:39:25,829 --> 02:39:28,840
research the disease, don't get hit by flying objects

851
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:38,700
final chapter

852
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:40,700
exorcist deluxe edition

853
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:44,219
cut off its head

854
02:39:44,219 --> 02:39:50,040
and the body will follow

855
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:54,459
that's what they say

856
02:39:54,459 --> 02:39:56,459
I have traveled too far on this path to turn back

857
02:39:56,459 --> 02:40:02,659
at least that's what I told myself

858
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:07,780
Iraq-Syria border

859
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:09,780
upper Mesopotamia

860
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:17,399
oh that's really immersion breaking

861
02:40:17,399 --> 02:40:20,979
chapter five, the tomb

862
02:40:20,979 --> 02:40:31,860
I gotta hold it like every

863
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:33,860
movie actor and every cartoon actor

864
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:35,860
you don't go like this, you go like this

865
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:41,370
wouldn't like your hair catch fire

866
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:44,569
holy shit, this is huge

867
02:40:44,569 --> 02:40:50,579
why not just hold it like here

868
02:40:50,579 --> 02:40:52,889
or like here, why go like this

869
02:40:52,889 --> 02:41:00,950
I gotta go that way

870
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:17,450
stick

871
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:23,450
that's haunted

872
02:41:23,450 --> 02:41:26,459
not bad, not bad, rock

873
02:41:26,459 --> 02:41:53,260
ah, alright, that's good

874
02:41:53,260 --> 02:42:05,030
ah, alright, corridor

875
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:17,049
ooh, bonfire

876
02:42:17,049 --> 02:42:40,309
oh wait a minute

877
02:42:40,309 --> 02:42:45,819
that's annoying

878
02:42:45,819 --> 02:42:53,559
at least I know what that is now

879
02:42:53,559 --> 02:42:55,559
defense center

880
02:42:55,559 --> 02:43:05,209
danger, do not enter

881
02:43:05,209 --> 02:43:08,409
it's gonna be, why did he open that

882
02:43:08,409 --> 02:43:14,360
gonna be a monster in here

883
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:27,459
shit, hell

884
02:43:27,459 --> 02:43:36,620
going back that way

885
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:39,110
wait, do I have my book of spells

886
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:47,559
what the hell

887
02:43:47,559 --> 02:44:10,459
that was fucking horrible

888
02:44:10,459 --> 02:44:17,860
light the candles up in this room

889
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:25,459
no way

890
02:44:25,459 --> 02:44:37,180
no way out

891
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:47,020
I gotta pull this, watch out for that

892
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:58,899
pull this, alright

893
02:44:58,899 --> 02:45:15,100
what are you doing to me

894
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:18,040
why are you doing this

895
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:25,190
bug, bug

896
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:36,379
I can't do anything with that

897
02:45:36,379 --> 02:45:40,090
I thought that was a turtle

898
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:48,090
why am I walking towards the scary voice

899
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:51,100
somebody above me

900
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:56,409
oh shit, happy Halloween everybody

901
02:45:56,409 --> 02:46:12,280
I went in a circle

902
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:14,280
that wraps around the circle, remember that

903
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:16,280
somebody keep that in mind

904
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:18,280
I'm gonna need that in like 10 minutes

905
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:31,979
what do you want me to repent, I'll do it

906
02:46:31,979 --> 02:46:36,500
tell me, what am I repenting

907
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:54,299
oops

908
02:46:54,299 --> 02:46:56,979
why did I do that, what was the point of that

909
02:46:56,979 --> 02:47:04,780
why did I do that

910
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:07,139
I feel like I needed that, did I need that

911
02:47:07,139 --> 02:47:22,870
softlocked

912
02:47:22,870 --> 02:47:28,760
this way right, yeah, follow the voice

913
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:34,569
bottom, I guess I'm gonna go with Diablo 2

914
02:47:34,569 --> 02:47:37,190
I feel like I'm in the maggot lair

915
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:49,459
hey, it's risen

916
02:47:49,459 --> 02:47:57,459
I feel like Christ

917
02:47:57,459 --> 02:48:07,819
I just went in a circle

918
02:48:07,819 --> 02:48:09,819
and this sucks, I just went in a goddamn circle

919
02:48:09,819 --> 02:48:15,450
alright, this way

920
02:48:15,450 --> 02:48:17,879
wrath 2

921
02:48:17,879 --> 02:48:19,879
I went all the way back

922
02:48:19,879 --> 02:48:32,860
oh

923
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:34,860
do I need to grab that rope and pull it along with me

924
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:45,350
we're gonna go right

925
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:49,829
he is risen, wrath

926
02:48:49,829 --> 02:48:59,540
now what

927
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:01,540
wrath is that way

928
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:06,840
go this way

929
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:15,100
this is a new room

930
02:49:15,100 --> 02:49:33,379
what's it doing, what is that

931
02:49:33,379 --> 02:49:36,780
should I spray it or something

932
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:42,219
should I spray the paintings

933
02:49:51,819 --> 02:50:00,569
I don't know, what the fuck

934
02:50:00,569 --> 02:50:03,299
I don't know

935
02:50:03,299 --> 02:50:05,299
I don't know if there's something wrong

936
02:50:05,299 --> 02:50:14,459
something going on, I don't know what's going on

937
02:50:14,459 --> 02:50:16,459
I was just trying to light the candles, I'm not trying to do anything mean

938
02:50:16,459 --> 02:50:29,510
I think it might be a hint time

939
02:50:29,510 --> 02:50:31,510
what do you think

940
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:38,420
it's time for a hint

941
02:50:38,420 --> 02:50:55,750
oh, it's gonna jump

942
02:50:55,750 --> 02:50:59,530
IRL

943
02:50:59,530 --> 02:51:04,579
walk forward, teleport

944
02:51:04,579 --> 02:51:11,750
that doesn't work, look

945
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:13,750
I'm not sure you can teleport in this whole level

946
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:19,559
I can't teleport

947
02:51:19,559 --> 02:51:21,559
how am I gonna be able to jump this, are you guys crazy

948
02:51:21,559 --> 02:51:25,719
in 30 feet

949
02:51:25,719 --> 02:51:27,719
throw the torch down, why would I listen to that guy

950
02:51:27,719 --> 02:51:34,760
thank you developers

951
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:36,760
I really appreciate it

952
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:40,090
that would be really

953
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:42,090
stupid to do that in real life

954
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:51,159
face devs

955
02:51:51,159 --> 02:51:53,159
go back to the rope, go back to the rope

956
02:51:53,159 --> 02:51:55,159
go back to the rope, go back to the rope

957
02:51:55,159 --> 02:51:57,159
go back to the rope, go back to the rope

958
02:51:57,159 --> 02:52:08,469
go back to the rope

959
02:52:08,469 --> 02:52:13,399
back to the rope

960
02:52:13,399 --> 02:52:16,200
sorry, now

961
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:20,600
I have to

962
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:23,100
take this rope

963
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:27,260
walk it through the whole level

964
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:29,750
what do we do

965
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:37,989
burn the rope

966
02:52:37,989 --> 02:52:50,540
I tried that already, they're not working

967
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:53,989
saw two waiting to grab it at the bottom

968
02:52:53,989 --> 02:53:03,979
it's part of the scary movie thing

969
02:53:03,979 --> 02:53:06,340
that's supposed to be happening

970
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:12,360
ah, ah

971
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:16,139
put it back, put it back, put it back

972
02:53:16,139 --> 02:53:18,309
put it back, put it back

973
02:53:18,309 --> 02:53:23,670
put it back, you know where it is

974
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:32,100
burn the rope

975
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:41,559
that doesn't work

976
02:53:41,559 --> 02:53:44,229
that doesn't work

977
02:53:44,229 --> 02:53:50,500
it's okay

978
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:52,500
it's knocking my shit everywhere

979
02:53:52,500 --> 02:54:08,680
I kind of

980
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:11,690
have ideas

981
02:54:11,690 --> 02:54:16,299
Abraham, how'd you get here sir

982
02:54:16,299 --> 02:54:25,370
down here

983
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:37,319
it's for me

984
02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:42,950
get the fuck away from me

985
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:47,299
damn it, that was a good idea

986
02:54:47,299 --> 02:54:55,940
these pictures

987
02:54:55,940 --> 02:55:12,440
go in here

988
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:20,059
invisible further inside

989
02:55:20,059 --> 02:55:27,290
back for you

990
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:30,549
okay, crap

991
02:55:30,549 --> 02:55:32,549
we pulled the rope off

992
02:55:32,549 --> 02:55:36,950
this way

993
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:40,860
right, left, this is the way

994
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:49,860
this

995
02:55:49,860 --> 02:55:54,540
dumb boy

996
02:55:54,540 --> 02:56:13,270
dumb boy

997
02:56:13,270 --> 02:56:27,350
I don't see anything highlighted

998
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:38,299
only highlights it for ten seconds

999
02:56:38,299 --> 02:56:50,950
oh, come on

1000
02:56:50,950 --> 02:56:56,389
it's risen

1001
02:56:56,389 --> 02:57:06,100
fast

1002
02:57:06,100 --> 02:57:09,180
spray the giant chasm

1003
02:57:09,180 --> 02:57:11,180
is softlock

1004
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:26,729
what is this?

1005
02:57:26,729 --> 02:57:31,659

moments where if that was a little kid

1032
02:59:25,899 --> 02:59:27,899

1033
02:59:27,899 --> 02:59:29,899

03:16:24,739 --> 03:16:26,739
why don't you die

1193
03:16:26,739 --> 03:16:30,709
not you, that guy

1194
03:16:30,709 --> 03:16:37,860
why

1195
03:16:37,860 --> 03:16:41,260
that was fucking horrible

1196
03:16:41,260 --> 03:16:48,040
that's the worst

1197
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:50,040
Dr. Seuss book

1198
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:52,469
that was the worst scare

1199
03:16:52,469 --> 03:17:01,299
of the whole game, comedy guy is the worst

1200
03:17:01,299 --> 03:17:08,020
character, here's the best part

1201
03:17:08,020 --> 03:17:10,020
about that, I can't see what you guys

1202
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:12,020
are writing in real time, so I don't know if you

1203
03:17:12,020 --> 03:17:14,020
hate it or not, I'm just

1204
03:17:14,020 --> 03:17:17,989
you know what

1205
03:17:17,989 --> 03:17:29,299
oh why

1206
03:17:29,299 --> 03:17:31,299
we love comedy guy, oh yes

1207
03:17:31,299 --> 03:17:37,319
I'm so happy

1208
03:17:37,319 --> 03:17:39,319
I actually lost like two years

1209
03:17:39,319 --> 03:17:41,319
of my life from that one

1210
03:17:41,319 --> 03:17:43,319
it just sprinted right into my face

1211
03:17:43,319 --> 03:17:45,620
oh my god

1212
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:48,819
I feel terrible

1213
03:17:48,819 --> 03:17:50,819
right now, I feel like somebody just punched me in the face

1214
03:17:50,819 --> 03:17:57,989
like five times

1215
03:17:57,989 --> 03:18:08,620
alright, get me out of here

1216
03:18:08,620 --> 03:18:11,430
I need a torch

1217
03:18:11,430 --> 03:18:17,700
alright, I can't see shit in there

1218
03:18:32,920 --> 03:18:40,979
bones here

1219
03:18:40,979 --> 03:18:43,159
god save me

1220
03:18:43,159 --> 03:18:47,379
I'll do it myself

1221
03:18:47,379 --> 03:19:05,690
oh look, that's what the rope

1222
03:19:05,690 --> 03:19:07,690
is there for, rope reveal

1223
03:19:07,690 --> 03:19:09,690
fog

1224
03:19:09,690 --> 03:19:13,379
fog

1225
03:19:13,379 --> 03:19:17,739
no, no

1226
03:19:17,739 --> 03:19:19,739
that's arguably more important

1227
03:19:19,739 --> 03:19:44,700
I want that cross

1228
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:51,979
let's get on this boat

1229
03:19:51,979 --> 03:20:00,229
on down, I move the boat

1230
03:20:00,229 --> 03:20:06,549
the fake bridge

1231
03:20:06,549 --> 03:20:08,549
I swear to god, Jeremy

1232
03:20:08,549 --> 03:20:10,549
oh

1233
03:20:10,549 --> 03:20:16,760
we're good

1234
03:20:16,760 --> 03:20:23,270
we're good

1235
03:20:23,270 --> 03:20:26,090
so fake bridge here

1236
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:38,680
oh, you just row

1237
03:20:38,680 --> 03:20:45,850
are we going?

1238
03:20:45,850 --> 03:20:51,739
oh, this is the bad part

1239
03:20:51,739 --> 03:20:53,739
this is father Phineas battle

1240
03:20:53,739 --> 03:20:55,739
of sanctism to Paul

1241
03:20:55,739 --> 03:20:59,500
if you listen to this

1242
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:01,500
I expect that Pazuzu has already

1243
03:21:01,500 --> 03:21:03,500
stayed in my mind

1244
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:05,500
I will not let him

1245
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:07,500
do the same to you

1246
03:21:07,500 --> 03:21:09,500
you must finish

1247
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:11,799
my work

1248
03:21:11,799 --> 03:21:13,799
however lucid his savage visions

1249
03:21:13,799 --> 03:21:15,799
however piercing his violent threats

1250
03:21:15,799 --> 03:21:17,799
he must be

1251
03:21:17,799 --> 03:21:19,799
stopped

1252
03:21:19,799 --> 03:21:21,799
his flame must be extinguished

1253
03:21:21,799 --> 03:21:23,799
and his presence expelled from the tomb

1254
03:21:23,799 --> 03:21:26,299
it is the only way

1255
03:21:26,299 --> 03:21:28,299
and he's gonna be like

1256
03:21:28,299 --> 03:21:40,950
right?

1257
03:21:40,950 --> 03:21:42,950
I see something up there

1258
03:21:42,950 --> 03:21:45,319
put the torch down

1259
03:21:45,319 --> 03:22:03,500
there's light, too much light

1260
03:22:03,500 --> 03:22:10,520
what the fuck is that?

1261
03:22:10,520 --> 03:22:12,520
oh shit, that's Pazuzu

1262
03:22:12,520 --> 03:22:14,520
that's the Pazuzu statue from the first chapter

1263
03:22:34,500 --> 03:22:37,639
it's gonna be a tongue

1264
03:22:37,639 --> 03:22:39,639
it's gonna be a giant frog

1265
03:22:39,639 --> 03:22:41,639
this is a tongue

1266
03:22:41,639 --> 03:22:45,100
that's a tongue

1267
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:55,979
thank god it's not a fucking guy's tongue

1268
03:22:55,979 --> 03:23:01,670
we gotta go up to Lord Pazuzu's

1269
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:11,909
temple

1270
03:23:11,909 --> 03:23:15,239
come on, man, let's go

1271
03:23:15,239 --> 03:23:38,709
this way

1272
03:23:38,709 --> 03:23:44,969
oh, I climbed this

1273
03:23:44,969 --> 03:23:47,209
we gotta lose the torch

1274
03:23:47,209 --> 03:23:52,780
alright, bye

1275
03:23:52,780 --> 03:24:04,090
okay, here we go, holy water

1276
03:24:04,090 --> 03:24:08,700
holy water, and then bring the demon out

1277
03:24:08,700 --> 03:25:03,979
here we go

1278
03:25:03,979 --> 03:25:24,329
undo it

1279
03:25:42,950 --> 03:25:44,950
through the

1280
03:25:44,950 --> 03:25:46,950
floorboards

1281
03:25:46,950 --> 03:25:48,950
you think humanity

1282
03:25:48,950 --> 03:25:50,950
deserves to thrive

1283
03:25:50,950 --> 03:25:52,950
in its own

1284
03:25:52,950 --> 03:25:54,950
rotting decay

1285
03:25:54,950 --> 03:25:56,950
that's the wolf from the never ending story

1286
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:59,129
that I should not indulge

1287
03:25:59,129 --> 03:26:01,129
in humanity's madness

1288
03:26:01,129 --> 03:26:06,549
let you

1289
03:26:06,549 --> 03:26:08,549
such an holy slime

1290
03:26:08,549 --> 03:26:10,549
carry on the gods

1291
03:26:10,549 --> 03:26:17,340
back! stay back!

1292
03:26:17,340 --> 03:26:20,090
I will use

1293
03:26:20,090 --> 03:26:22,090
how I knew that you have never seen

1294
03:26:22,090 --> 03:26:24,090
before of the thousands of years

1295
03:26:24,090 --> 03:26:28,760
you don't scare me

1296
03:26:28,760 --> 03:26:30,760
vile demon

1297
03:26:30,760 --> 03:26:33,129
if you think I'm going to be

1298
03:26:33,129 --> 03:26:35,129
terrified by something as vile

1299
03:26:35,129 --> 03:26:37,129
as you, you have been mistaken

1300
03:26:37,129 --> 03:26:39,940
now come down here and face me

1301
03:26:39,940 --> 03:26:41,940
and face the light

1302
03:26:41,940 --> 03:26:58,819
face the light

1303
03:26:58,819 --> 03:27:00,819
once that cracks into twelve o'clock

1304
03:27:00,819 --> 03:27:02,819
noon

1305
03:27:02,819 --> 03:27:04,819
you will be vanquished from this earth

1306
03:27:04,819 --> 03:27:08,860
once and for all

1307
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:10,860
once and for all

1308
03:27:10,860 --> 03:27:12,860
get a little scared

1309
03:27:12,860 --> 03:27:22,010
but it's okay

1310
03:27:22,010 --> 03:27:26,170
stay right there

1311
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:28,979
it's time I accept

1312
03:27:28,979 --> 03:27:30,979
that you are of any

1313
03:27:30,979 --> 03:27:32,979
species

1314
03:27:32,979 --> 03:27:34,979
no, no I will not accept

1315
03:27:34,979 --> 03:27:41,899

1316
03:27:41,899 --> 03:27:45,739
right, no I don't need to spread

1317
03:27:45,739 --> 03:27:47,739

1381
03:32:22,010 --> 03:32:24,010
that didn't really know they were watching this stream

1382
03:32:24,010 --> 03:32:26,010
potentially my neighbors

1383
03:32:26,010 --> 03:32:28,010
think that there is some weird

1384
03:32:28,010 --> 03:32:30,010
really wild shit going on in this stream

1385
03:32:30,010 --> 03:32:32,760
performing exorcisms talking about like

1386
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:34,760
slay the demon, go back to hell where you

1387
03:32:34,760 --> 03:32:36,760
belong, go back to where you came

1388
03:32:36,760 --> 03:32:38,760
eat holy water, like what am I doing in here

1389
03:32:38,760 --> 03:32:45,079
this is concerning

1390
03:32:45,079 --> 03:32:54,040
let's do this

1391
03:32:54,040 --> 03:32:56,040
alright that ending sequence

1392
03:32:56,040 --> 03:32:58,040
was pretty crazy, it was really good

1393
03:32:58,040 --> 03:33:00,219
75% I'll take it

1394
03:33:00,219 --> 03:33:02,219
what time is that by the way, that is

1395
03:33:02,219 --> 03:33:05,159
well would you look at that, it is

1396
03:33:05,159 --> 03:33:07,159
would be 11.10

1397
03:33:07,159 --> 03:33:21,590
11.10

1398
03:33:21,590 --> 03:33:23,590
alright let's uh

1399
03:33:23,590 --> 03:33:25,899
what are we doing, 11.05, 11.10

1400
03:33:25,899 --> 03:33:28,579
sorry I just punched you

1401
03:33:28,579 --> 03:33:44,889
is that

1402
03:33:44,889 --> 03:33:46,889
a zuzu in there

1403
03:33:46,889 --> 03:33:49,450
is this the chief

1404
03:33:49,450 --> 03:33:51,450
disgusting vile human

1405
03:33:51,450 --> 03:33:56,819
same like actor

1406
03:33:56,819 --> 03:34:03,100
oh this is cool, this is all the stuff

1407
03:34:03,100 --> 03:34:05,100
why wouldn't we want to get rid of this or something

1408
03:34:05,100 --> 03:34:09,190
I don't think we want to keep that

1409
03:34:09,190 --> 03:34:14,040
all my stuff, oh cool

1410
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:25,879
this is all my things

1411
03:34:25,879 --> 03:34:28,569
that was fun, actually pretty good

1412
03:34:28,569 --> 03:34:31,000
I'm coming out

1413
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:35,799
coming out, coming out

1414
03:34:35,799 --> 03:34:40,219
that was good, that was actually really fun

1415
03:34:40,219 --> 03:34:47,620
how's your hair, how's my face

1416
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:50,440
don't worry about that

1417
03:34:50,440 --> 03:34:52,440
I'm more worried about like the 5

1418
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:54,440
FPS camera that I have

1419
03:34:54,440 --> 03:35:01,270
next game, yeah we will

1420
03:35:01,270 --> 03:35:03,270
we're going to move on to the

1421
03:35:03,270 --> 03:35:06,659
actually hold on, I have the

1422
03:35:06,659 --> 03:35:08,659
walking dead, walking dead is coming up

1423
03:35:08,659 --> 03:35:13,139
next, either the walking dead or

1424
03:35:13,139 --> 03:35:16,920
what's a short one

1425
03:35:16,920 --> 03:35:18,920
I'm probably not going to go for more than probably another hour

1426
03:35:18,920 --> 03:35:24,540
what's a short one, I don't want

1427
03:35:24,540 --> 03:35:26,540
to do Five Nights at Freddy's, no, I played that game

1428
03:35:26,540 --> 03:35:28,540
I played that game in like 2012, I played them all

1429
03:35:28,540 --> 03:35:34,940
how about a chair

1430
03:35:34,940 --> 03:35:38,260
in a room, excuse me

1431
03:35:38,260 --> 03:35:41,530
you didn't do it in VR

1432
03:35:41,530 --> 03:35:45,049
you really don't

1433
03:35:45,049 --> 03:35:47,610
the VR one is better, the VR one is different

1434
03:35:47,610 --> 03:35:51,829
alright, how about this

1435
03:35:51,829 --> 03:35:53,829
we'll save that for Halloween night

1436
03:35:53,829 --> 03:35:55,829
but I'm going to play a chair in a room

1437
03:35:55,829 --> 03:35:57,829
it's probably not going to be very good, but it might be

1438
03:35:57,829 --> 03:35:59,829
let's have our expectations in the right place, don't you think

1439
03:35:59,829 --> 03:36:03,159
and then we'll do the walking dead as well

1440
03:36:03,159 --> 03:36:05,159
I'm going to play a bunch of scary random shit on Halloween night too

1441
03:36:05,159 --> 03:36:07,530
let me go just get some water

1442
03:36:07,530 --> 03:36:09,530
I'll be right back, see you in a minute

1443
03:36:09,530 --> 03:36:14,010
go back from which you came
