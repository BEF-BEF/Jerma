1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:14,169
Hi guys. How are you? Where's my stuff? What happened to my stuff?

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,089
Hold on, why is this over here? I haven't been here in like

3
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:23,129
like 38 hours, not like six weeks. Why is all my shit moved around?

4
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:52,310
Hold on. Yeah, that's a little better. Why the fuck is everyone moved around?

5
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:59,159
I didn't do that. Somebody like snuck in my room and did it.

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,289
All right, so hello there. Tonight we're gonna play

7
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:12,819
Mount and Blade Warband. I have an incredibly highly requested game

8
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:20,219
that... it took me like a year to get it on the screen.

9
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,379
It was a very, very tough battle between Mount and Blade and

10
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:32,379
I Spy Children's... Haunted Mansion kids children's game

11
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:44,180
thing and Desert Buzz. Let me get a sip of that coffee

12
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,459
and I'll be live at about two... I am live. I'll be here in about 15 seconds.

13
00:01:48,459 --> 00:02:23,780
Hold on. Okay, sorry. I have two pieces of music playing in my ear at the same

14
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,580
time and it's jamming me. I have the Mount and Blade Star Wars

15
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,759
music going on and then also this. This is what I'm

16
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:42,180
playing. Ready? All right, let me get that over here. All

17
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,520
right, let's go. Mount and Blade Warband. I have no idea how

18
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,159
this game plays. I was told it was kind of like Kenshi. You wander the

19
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:04,729
wasteland or something like that and now you

20
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:09,719
should be able to see it. It's kind of like Kenshi but with a

21
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:20,069
thousand people. Oh god. Okay, well this is gonna be interesting.

22
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,860
All right, should I... I gotta play the tutorial, right? I have no idea what's

23
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,960
going on. You approach a field where the locals are

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,139
training with weapons you can practice here to improve your combat skills.

25
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,400
Continue... that's... Okay, we're just here. Walk around the training field and speak

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,039
with the fighters to practice various actors of Mount and Blade combat.

27
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,599
You can use Asdy... Come on, that's Wasdy, not Asdy.

28
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,319
Move around to talk to a character, approach him until his name appears on

29
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,919
your screen, then press the F key. You can also use the F key to pick up

30
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,050
items. Open doors interact with objects. Press

31
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,050
tab to exit the tutorial at any time. Okay, so

32
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,939
walk and then... Is there a sprint? There's a practice on this guy's head.

33
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:09,830
A novice fighter. Hello there, we're polishing off our combat skills with a bit

34
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,550
of sparring practice. You look like you could use a bit of training.

35
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,750
Why don't you join us and we can show you a few tricks.

36
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,790
And if you need an explanation of any combat concepts, just ask and I will do

37
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:26,870
my best to fill you in. Let's attack. Okay, I'm not going to read

38
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,720
any of the stuff up there. No, no, no. I... Why would I do that?

39
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,939
I need to, like, know what to do. Why would I not read it?

40
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:41,180
All right, there are four principal directions for attacking.

41
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,060
These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing,

42
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,939
chew chew chew, hey hey hey. Now I'll tell you which direction to attack from and

43
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,139
you must try to do the correct attack. Move your mouse while you press the left

44
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,620
mouse button to specify attack direction. Okay, so it's mouse movement and click.

45
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,579
Now for example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up

46
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,430
at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will

47
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,930
help you do the correct action. Okay, so he wants me to do what? Swing to

48
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:27,720
left. Okay, how many more? Down? Can you move around and do that?

49
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,980
I guess you can. Very good. You've learned how to attack from

50
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,540
any direction you want. If you like, we can try this again and move to a

51
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,990
different exercise. I would like to practice blocking.

52
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,589
Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks from coming from

53
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:50,629
one direction. For example, if you block up, you'll

54
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,230
deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust

55
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,110
attacks. Bullshit. All right, you must press and

56
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,149
hold down the right mouse button to block.

57
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,620
Okay, I'll now attack you with different types of strokes

58
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,660
and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking. Try to do the

59
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,100
correct block as soon as you can. This practice is easy to do with the

60
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,019
automatic block direction setting, which is the default.

61
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:23,139
All right, well I'm not turning that off. If you go to the options menu and change

62
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,779
defend direction, control the mouse movement or keyboard, you'll need to

63
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,060
manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging, but makes

64
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,220
the game much more interesting. This practice can be useful if you use

65
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,029
manual blocking. I don't care. No, I ain't gonna, I ain't

66
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:47,800
ready for that. So I just gotta parry until you hold?

67
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,500
Hold. Yeah, I'm not doing the direct, I can do the direction shoot with the other

68
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,089
thing. Swinging. Not with blocking.

69
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:12,170
Does this game suck? I'm curious. No, okay. Good, you're able to block my attack

70
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,009
successfully. You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time

71
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,949
until you're confident in your defense skills. Do you want to have another go?

72
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:29,160
No, I think I got it. Detective stream part two.

73
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,579
Well, I guess I'm like, okay, let's take a look at this here. I was just

74
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,829
fucking blue and you know what? I gotta do it.

75
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:46,279
I have to do it. I have to tell you guys something. I have to tell you a stream

76
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,779
that's coming up. I have to because I need help with that stream and there's

77
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,399
only one way I'm going to be able to do that

78
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,680
and that's with throwing a line out to the community.

79
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:10,839
I have to do it. So I need, you know what? I'm gonna do, we'll do this in the

80
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,620
discord. Later on in the discord either today or

81
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:21,110
tomorrow, I'm gonna throw a line out about something to do with robotics.

82
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,750
Okay? If you know about robotics, specifically twitch-controlled robotics,

83
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:36,169
I may need to ask you a few questions. So, uh,

84
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,610
I'm gonna throw the line out to the community because I've been trying to do

85
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,659
research. I've been trying to figure it out for months

86
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:56,740
and that's the way we're gonna go with it. Bionic boomer stream.

87
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,860
What? I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna give you the punch line because that's very

88
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,769
important, but it's not the bionic boomer stream.

89
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,019
That's completely different. This is something else, but like I need,

90
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,279
I need some community help on it, I think. I'll throw the line out in the

91
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:22,980
discord later. All right, let's go. Do I get to create

92
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,179
my character? Uh, what do you want to practice? I want

93
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,149
to practice attacking. Blocking. Let's do some spar. No.

94
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,870
Regular fighter. Okay, I, do I know everything?

95
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:43,860
Do I need to spar? Non-lethal weapons. All right, let's go.

96
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm ready. Okay, killed that guy. We were supposed to do non-lethal attacks.

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,289
Okay, uh, next time be more careful. Well, I, okay, but did I hit him right in

98
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,740
the face? That was good, but next time be more

99
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,750
careful. Okay, I'll be more careful.

100
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:25,669
Why can't I block this? Okay, this guy obviously

101
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:33,529
is not gonna spar with me. Uh, I'd like to do something else. All right,

102
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,629
what's this? You get to block every time they change

103
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:43,019
the direction. Okay, riding trainer. Good day, I've come here for some riding

104
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,220
practice, but my old bones are aching badly, so I

105
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,539
decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your

106
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,379
horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise

107
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,730
would be good for her. Yes, I'd love to practice riding.

108
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,809
Pre-recorded stream talking voice. Uh, good, now I'll give you a few exercises

109
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,220
that will teach you riding and horseback weapon use.

110
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,460
Just take your horse for a ride on the course. Go as slow or as fast as you like.

111
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,419
Come back when you feel confident as a rider, and I'll give you some tougher

112
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,240
exercises. Okay, mount a horse by f. That's practice

113
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,649
horse. Ride, how do you ride? Just w-a-s-d?

114
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:31,259
I'm sorry, a-s-w-e-d? Whatever, whatever they said. It's very loud.

115
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:43,080
Uh, I may need to turn this down a little. That's better. Right, so

116
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,840
don't attack anything, just just ride. Is there a faster way to go?

117
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:59,669
Do what, what kind of weapons do I get in this game? Stick?

118
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:06,149
Long stick? Short stick? This is like 1,645, right?

119
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,669
All they had is brums back then. They didn't have any real weapons.

120
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:25,059
They had molotovs? No, they didn't. You finished the exercise, now go back to the

121
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:32,519
trainer and talk to him. Okay, how do I get off? Oh, thanks.

122
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,789
How do I get off the horse? F, okay. Uh, move on to something more difficult.

123
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,590
Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course hitting each

124
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,649
target at least once. Okay, grab the lance. Grab the long stick.

125
00:12:46,649 --> 00:13:06,860
See? It's just huge brums. Strike the dummy. How? Just got it. Not really that

126
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,149
good of mounted combat apparently. Is there a certain like hitbox or

127
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:23,820
something or is it? Okay, there we go. It's a little weird.

128
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,980
It's kind of, I'm gonna run into people like this accidentally.

129
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,120
All right, that's not bad. This game's fucking sick.

130
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm just kidding. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding guys, don't worry.

131
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,509
I'm in the damn tutorial. It is though. I know, I know, I'm just fucking around.

132
00:13:53,909 --> 00:14:08,679
Delivered 29, so this really is like third person Kenshi, just the way that it

133
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,720
looks. It's by the same people, the same one

134
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,070
guy make this game. Your next challenge would be to using a

135
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,669
bone arrow to shoot at the archery targets by the road.

136
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:23,580
Put in each target to consider yourself successful. Okay.

137
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:30,179
Go near the practice bone, press F to pick it up. How do I get off the horse?

138
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:35,899
You didn't give me that information. How do I get off? How do I get off?

139
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:45,929
Oh, come on, in fucking Red Dead Redemption, you just have to press

140
00:14:45,929 --> 00:15:03,419
triangle. Now do I need to, on horseback, so I gotta ride over there and do it?

141
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,340
So shoot it, how do I shoot it? Just hold it down? Okay.

142
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:21,049
Is there a way to stabilize? What's like the drop on this?

143
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:38,950
Press R, first person. Um, where's the, got it.

144
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:46,139
Uh, I don't want that view. I'd rather be on this view. It's gonna aim way higher

145
00:15:46,139 --> 00:16:00,899
than that. Okay, this is weird. Can I?

146
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:14,460
Press, you hold shift to zoom in. So you gotta aim higher than that.

147
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:25,779
Control plus space? Why do you have dummies

148
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:34,259
in the same place there? I'd rather not go first person.

149
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:45,100
That hit. What? That didn't hit? How did that not hit?

150
00:16:45,100 --> 00:17:13,880
Okay, can I please, the first time. Horse archery is OP, chat is dumb, level

151
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:22,220
it up. Well, let me learn how to do it first.

152
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,140
One guy said that, but guess what? Cash in your one guy tokens!

153
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,059
I also made myself a lot louder. Am I like really fucking loud? I should be

154
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:40,970
really loud. I didn't, I didn't increase the volume in my voice.

155
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,730
All right, able-to-shoot-a-torque-to-the-horseback-I-keep-riding-practice-do-today-and-you-breed-expert-horse-man.

156
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:56,420
All right, now what the hell do I do? That guy's like dropped into take push-ups.

157
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,819
Uh, you're standing in a really awkward, weird place. No.

158
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:16,900
Um, did I do it all? Am I tutorial done? I don't see anything else to do. What about

159
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:27,579
this guy? Archery, okay, hold on. Well, I didn't even know how to do this.

160
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:30,700
I went to the horseback archery before I did the regular archery.

161
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,460
The bow is a difficult weapon to master, but once you are sufficiently good at it,

162
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,980
you can shoot quickly and with great power.

163
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:50,009
Shoot the targets. The size of the targeting recticule

164
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:53,450
indicates your accuracy. Press and hold down the left mouse button until the

165
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,809
recticule shrinks down to its minimum size. Release the left mouse button when

166
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,529
its recticule is at its smallest. If you want it to wait too long,

167
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:10,019
if you wait too long, the recticule will expand again. All right, okay, I get you.

168
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:20,859
Hey, whoa, easy. Put the fucking safety on.

169
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,099
Well, so let's take a look at how the drop is then.

170
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,450
That's not hitting it. Am I fucking missing something here?

171
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:40,859
No, this is going in. So that, okay, I am hitting it.

172
00:19:40,859 --> 00:20:12,839
Do I have to hit this 72 times? Okay, what? Oh!

173
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,670
Well, all right. I'm sorry, but the guy standing here,

174
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:34,250
there are targets over here, people practicing.

175
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:54,779
I hit it. Do I have to hit the tip? Oh, that's not going where I want it to.

176
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,579
Not bad, not bad at all. You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now try to

177
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:01,769
do the same thing with a crossbow. Take the crossbow of the bolts over there

178
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,289
and shoot those three targets. The crossbow is much easier to shoot with

179
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:09,609
compared with the bow, but you need to reload it after each shot.

180
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:22,180
I think I'm gonna be a crossbow guy. Okay, let's zoom it in.

181
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:32,900
Ooh, how do you reload? Just like that. This thing's great. I mean, it does take

182
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,599
too long to reload, but... All right, good. You didn't have too much

183
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,640
difficulty using the crossbow either. Next, you'll learn to use throwing weapons.

184
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,319
Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets.

185
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:54,920
Let's pick up the fucking sausage. Let's get the big cigar.

186
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,200
Let's get the big cartoon bachelor party cigar.

187
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:25,049
Well, that's weird. Yeah, it takes a little adjusting. Yeah, it's all right.

188
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,009
Well, with that you have received the basic skills to use all three types of

189
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,289
ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice.

190
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:35,849
Train each and every day and in time you will be as good as the best

191
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:41,380
marksman in Calradia. Now go talk with the melee

192
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,339
fighters of the hoistmanship trainer. They can teach you important stuff. So I

193
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:50,710
did it all. It's done good, right? It's a direction

194
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:59,990
block, direction, archery. All right, so just hit tab.

195
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:07,259
Start a new game. Oh god, now I gotta do the fucking voice.

196
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:12,059
I gotta put on a fucking voice now. Welcome adventurer to Mountain Blade

197
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,779
Warband. Before beginning the game you must create

198
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:17,900
your character. No, this is not that important. Remember then in the

199
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,140
traditional medieval society depicted in the game,

200
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,059
war and politics are usually dominated by male members of the nobility.

201
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,619
That does not, however, mean that you should not choose to play a female

202
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:29,579
character or one who is not of noble birth.

203
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,339
Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start but women and commoners can

204
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,539
attain all the same goals and in fact may have much more interesting

205
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:45,160
if more challenging early game. Okay, uh sometimes I just, I want the game

206
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,480
just to be, it said it was gonna be like harder to be like,

207
00:23:49,480 --> 00:24:01,180
you were born years ago in a land far away.

208
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,259
Easy, no, I'll just, everybody quiet down.

209
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:09,019
Everybody quiet down or I'm gonna put on the YouTuber voice.

210
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:14,789
Do you want that this whole stream? I'll do it.

211
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:18,549
You were born years ago in a land far away. Your father

212
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:35,940
was a noble because that's the easy one. A thief, a hunter, a veteran, warrior.

213
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,220
This is not me though, this is my father. I don't have to be like my father.

214
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:57,220
A hunter. Um, I don't know. You came into this world a son of a declining nobility

215
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,779
owning only the house in which they lived. However, despite your family's

216
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,619
hardships they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood

217
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,619
for the

218
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,789
life in court. You started to learn about the world almost as soon as you could

219
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,269
walk and talk. You spent your early life as a page at

220
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:35,799
the nobleman's court. A street urchin? I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

221
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,220
politician. I get to play the part. As a boy growing out of childhood you

222
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,420
were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land.

223
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,099
There your first lessons were in humility as you waited upon the lords

224
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,339
and ladies of the household. But from their chess games, their

225
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,299
gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love,

226
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,380
you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition.

227
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,900
You also learned from the rough games of the other children

228
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,059
who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elder's swords.

229
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,420
Then as a young adult life changed, as it always does,

230
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:18,299
you became a game poacher, a

231
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:28,059
university student. I got a real fucking non-like video game life here, don't I?

232
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:36,460
But you're oh a thief, oh a peasant working my way as a warrior.

233
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,859
I read books. No, that's not a video game start.

234
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,940
No, the distinction felt certain to you. Somewhere along the way you'd become a

235
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,420
man and the whole world seemed to change

236
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,339
around you. You found yourself as a student in the

237
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:56,940
university of one of the great cities where you studied theology, philosophy

238
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,500
and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned

239
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,380
in the lecture halls. You may or may not have joined in with

240
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,339
your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women

241
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:09,819
and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw

242
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:12,779
is set. How an angry townsman can be persuaded to

243
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,220
set down his club and accept cash as compensation for the

244
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,619
destruction of his shop. But soon everything changed and you

245
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,180
decided to strike out on your own as an adventurer.

246
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:32,819
What made you take this decision was personal revenge.

247
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,660
Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an

248
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,960
adventurer. Still it was not a difficult choice to

249
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,990
leave with the rage burning brightly in your heart.

250
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,950
You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone and

251
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:59,180
these debts only to be paid in blood. Become an adventurer and ride to your

252
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,650
destiny. All right we got we got the noble houses

253
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:10,279
of Game of Thrones. House Lannister. House Tyrell. House

254

00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:59,099
Woodsmans. Oops. How did I just click? I don't know which one I clicked.

260
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,210
Which one? Who did I pick? The three horsemen?

261
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,329
Okay I picked the three horsemen of the apocalypse. We don't need famine. Who

262
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,930
fucking cares? Uh no quitting without saving. Allow me

263
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:19,880
to quit without saving. Uh realistic. No allow me to fucking

264
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,319
I don't wait aren't these what are these both saying?

265
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,990
No quitting without saving. Allow me to quit

266
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:37,240
without saving. What is it how is what I mean realistic? So like if I exit the

267
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,529
game because I didn't like how that's just like allow me to save scum right?

268
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:48,779
Yeah allow me to save scum. I'm not gonna pick the first one are you

269
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,779
kidding me? What the hell would I do that for?

270
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,819
Now enter your name and distribute your attribute. You can scale and weapon

271
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:58,380
points. You can click on various elements on the

272
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,259
screen to learn how each one will affect your character.

273
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,779
All right I'm not doing I won't do that anymore. All right iron flesh power

274
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:13,400
strike power throw draw health 44 to 44 experience ball 43 next

275
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,289
level at 600. Oh god I don't know what the fuck I want

276
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:30,569
to do. I have no idea what any of this means.

277
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:40,380
Uh cart carton uh cor

278
00:30:40,380 --> 00:31:04,440
cor carton carton like uh carton carton cart

279
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,299
uh strength agility I need to read these.

280
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:15,740
Every point adds plus one to hit points so this is health

281
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,650
and the following skills cannot be developed beyond one third of strength.

282
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,250
Agility each point gives you five gives five weapon points

283
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:33,819
and increased movement speed so this is weapon points and movement speed.

284
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:38,490
This next one is int every point intelligence immediately gives one extra

285
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,750
skill point so this is a skill point so this is for

286
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,380
this and then cha. Cha each point increases your party

287
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,339
limit size by plus one the following skills cannot be developed okay so this

288
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:56,819
is party limit. Those of you that are just

289
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,859
joining us in for the first time or that have never seen me play a game

290
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:03,779
like this I have no idea what to do. This is the first time I've ever opened

291
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,859
a mountain blade game ever. That's a lie. I opened this one like a

292
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,740
year and a half ago and like looked at the menu a little

293
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:18,839
bit. I don't know what to do and this is going to be terrible

294
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,839
because people are going to get so angry with me

295
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,359
because I'm going to put like two points into spotting and everyone's going to be

296
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,279
like why would you put points into spotting that's not

297
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,019

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,699
that's all this does it's stupid it's dumb and you should never put a point

332
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:50,019
into it right guys each point to this skill increases melee damage by eight

333
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:56,780
percent that's pretty great let's character use

334
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:05,719
more powerful bows each point this oh it's one of those days I don't know

335
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:10,869
why I'm in one of these moods so this is like super bow makes it easier

336
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:13,829
to learn weapon proficiencies increase the proficiency limits limits go to 60

337

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:59,099
of loot obtained by 10% I'm sorry but like I'm that's that looks

344
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:05,860
good to me every day each hero with the skill adds

345
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:14,599
some experience to every other member of the party

346
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:22,010
that's kind of cool tracking tracks become more informative

347
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:28,969

353
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:55,210
per level of the skill surgery each point to the skill gives

354
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,329
a four percent chance that a mortally struck party member will be wounded

355
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:03,210
rather than killed uh-huh first aid heroes regain five

356
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,809

other for supremacy a haven for knights and mercenaries

386

cutthroats and adventurers all willing to risk their lives in pursuit of

387
00:43:56,329 --> 00:44:00,090
fortune power or glory in this land which holds great dangers

388
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,369

415
00:46:45,690 --> 00:47:01,349
that's an old meme jerma kingdom of the nords whatever that means I just look

416
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:06,539
over the chat and I see oh my god he's gonna get wrecked he's gonna get wrecked

417
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:11,989
you took passage with a trading longship carrying

418
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:15,750
grifalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for

419
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,030
linen and wool the best part about making an RPG is you can just make up

420
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,190
words you can make it but it doesn't matter

421
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:26,360
what the fucking word is it can mean anything

422
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,440
okay and it sailed early in the season but the master reckoned

423
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,639
at the risk of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by

424
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:37,719
arriving ahead of the sea raiders who by april would be sailing forth from

425
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,480
their island layers to ravage calradia's coasts

426
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,840
it was some relief when your ship came inside of the delta

427
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,119
of the vill and bollock rivers and a short while later road past tidal flats

428
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,159
and coastal marshes to the city of sargoth

429
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:58,869
home to the sea raiders distant kinsmen the nordic lords

430
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:02,389
who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but

431
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:07,610
troubled land okay you were exhausted by the time you

432
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,369
find the inn in sargoth and fall asleep quickly however you

433
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:14,170
awake before dawn and are eager to explore your surroundings

434
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,289
you venture out onto the streets which are still

435
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:22,010
deserted all of a sudden you hear a sound that stands the hairs of your neck

436
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:33,219
on end the rasp of a blade sliding from its scabbard

437
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:49,960

447
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,599
i'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow that's one less

448
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,960
thief to trouble our streets at night although heaven knows he won't be the

449
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,380
last anyway maybe you can help me with

450
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,940
something let's talk more inside out here we

451
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:58,119
don't know who's listening uh the merchant takes you to his house

452
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,679
once inside he stands by the door for a while checking the street and then

453
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:05,079
finally convinced you've not been followed comes near you to speed

454
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:14,789
it's a lie he's coming to kill me so can i reload this

455
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:23,829
oops i can't take my bolts back sorry i was just testing that

456
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:32,659
all right what do we need uh now let me explain my proposition

457
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:38,420
we've always had brigands in the hills driven to banditry by war debt or love

458
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,059
of violence recently however they've been getting

459
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:43,780
bolder leaving their camps in the wild and

460
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:50,969
venturing into town looking for unwary prey the

461
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:53,929
the watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the

462
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,809
frontiers fewer men to keep an eye on the streets

463
00:51:56,809 --> 00:52:00,570
but i'm not sure what to make of that it seems to me that the most logical

464
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:04,409
explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls

465
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:07,849
who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting

466
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:14,039
targets last week you see they took my brother i

467
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:17,480
don't know what my brother was thinking a lad from a prominent house this is

468
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,519
just a bad uh this is a bad audiobook this is like

469
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:26,599
they outsourced the audiobook to like fiber is what i'm doing right

470
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,789
now seriously i don't know what my brother was

471
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:33,429
thinking a lad from a prominent house out alone

472
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:37,909
after dark in times like these well i suppose you were too but you're

473
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:40,869
a stranger here and didn't know how bad things have

474
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:44,469
become he had no such excuse but he's family

475
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:48,389
so what can you do if you don't protect your kin then people will start

476
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:51,110
thinking that you can't protect your investments either

477
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,909
and i can't have that no doubt the gang will soon send word about a ransom

478
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:03,349
but i don't care to pay it do a nord voice i don't know what that means

479
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:09,239
what do you mean a nord voice so here's my proposition now that i can only do

480
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:22,340
irish so here's my proposition you look like

481
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,500
you've had a bit of experience with the blade

482
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,860
and more importantly you must have a bit of fire in your belly

483
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,219
or you wouldn't be coming to calradia to seek your fortune

484
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:35,190
so here's what i'm asking you to do gather a small party

485
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,110
track down these bandits to their lair teach them a lesson they won't forget

486
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,880
and get my brother back safe in return you'll earn my lasting gratitude

487
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:57,480
in a bit of silver what do you say you fucking nailed it you won't be able to

488
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,519
do this by yourself though if you try and take on the whole gang of

489
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:04,599
single-handedly the hunter will become the hunted and i'll warrant

490
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,000
you'll first want to round up a group of volunteers there's always a few lads in

491
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,639
the villages around here looking for a bit of work that's

492
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,320
more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water they'll follow you if you

493
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,909
pay so take this purse of a hundred denars

494
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:23,750
consider it an advance on your reward go around to the villages and use the

495
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,630
money to hire some help i'll reckon that you need at least five

496
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:34,949
men to take on these bandits five men very good sir i'll go collect some

497
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:39,460
men from the other villages good you can find me in the tavern here

498
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,300
in sargoth after you've got your group together then we'll

499
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,179
speak about what we do next you have taken your first quest you may

00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,059
craftsmen do a thriving business and some migrants appear to be coming here

507
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:50,219
from other regions to seek their luck you see the banner of king ragnar

oh six i didn't save it as the party member with the highest

844
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:24,520
tactic skill one you decide you devise a plan that will

845
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,489
allow you and your men to escape with your lives

846
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:32,010
this is but this kind of plan okay this is like we're all

847
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:36,659
idiots and i'm the one guy okay this is like going to recess

848
01:38:36,659 --> 01:38:40,420
and it's like the fourth fifth and sixth graders are outside

849
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:43,460
and everybody listens to the sixth grader that wants to play like the

850
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:46,180
nerf football game and he makes up the rules

851
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:52,920
just because they just happen to be in the sixth grade that's what this is

852
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,079
if you're in the fourth grade sorry you don't get to make the rules you have to

853
01:38:55,079 --> 01:38:57,590
listen to the rules made up by the sixth grader

854
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:02,869
um i'm the sixth grader in this case so one person has to stay back and die

855
01:39:02,869 --> 01:39:06,390
go on you tell one of your troops to hold the enemy while you

856
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:20,949
i can't pick who it is morale we're fine all right we're gonna go

857
01:39:20,949 --> 01:39:27,829
to ambient what's this six plus five plus one

858
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:31,989
one of them pregnant i don't understand five and one's expecting

859
01:39:31,989 --> 01:39:46,760
but how the fuck do i get over here looters i could probably take them

860
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:56,630
hold on a minute wait i didn't level up click on the party tab

861
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:09,029
seven plus one ready to be upgraded upgrade to huntsman or footman uh

862
01:40:09,029 --> 01:40:26,569

863
01:40:26,569 --> 01:40:31,560

864
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,039
all right we got a footman around here i don't want to fucking fight this guy

865
01:40:36,039 --> 01:40:45,689
is there a quick save all right kidnappers hideout

866
01:40:45,689 --> 01:40:55,109
i'm a footman no you're not kidnappers hideout

867
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:59,189
you approach the hideout the looters don't appear to have

868
01:40:59,189 --> 01:41:03,420
spotted you yet and you could still sneak away unnoticed

869
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,939
the difficult approach to the site down a narrow defile

870
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:09,739
means that only a handful of troops in your party will be able to join the

871
01:41:09,739 --> 01:41:12,699
attack and they will be unable to bring their horses

872
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:16,699
if your initial attack fails the looters will easily be able to make their escape

873
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:19,579
and disperse do you wish to attack the hideout or wait

874
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:30,489
for another occasion uh they're not what other occasion is

875

949
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:43,159
that way if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl no one can say it's my

950
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:45,560
fault but that's not your problem here's the

951
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:52,579
rest of your reward it was well earned thanks man oh the money is most welcome

952
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:56,739
and i'm glad to have been of service thanks good now are you interested in

953
01:51:56,739 --> 01:52:01,939
making some more yeah what do you got remember how i told

954
01:52:01,939 --> 01:52:07,289
you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls i think i know who that

955
01:52:07,289 --> 01:52:10,659
is the captain of the watch no less some

956
01:52:10,659 --> 01:52:14,659
months ago the captain seeking the amount of profit we merchants were

957
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:18,659
making from trade across the frontiers decided to borrow some money to sponsor

958
01:52:18,659 --> 01:52:23,300
a caravan unfortunately like many who are new to

959
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,380
commerce he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk

960
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:31,300
so he sank all of his money into the most expensive commodities and of course

961
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:38,859
his caravan was captured and looted and he lost everything

962
01:52:38,859 --> 01:52:42,539
as a consequence it seems our captain turned to villainy

963
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:47,180
to recoup his fortune i supposed i'd do the same if the heavens forbid

964
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:52,380
i ever faced indebtedness and ruination now any watch captain worth his salary

965
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:55,500
will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll

966
01:52:55,500 --> 01:53:00,460
to inform on the rest but our captain decides to employ these bandits

967
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,100
wholesale he brings them into the town lets them

968
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:06,140
do as they will and takes a share of their take

969
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:09,579
you've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers well

970
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:15,500
in the most unfortunate land of calradia sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher

971
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:19,579
luckily there's are there's still a few brave honest souls in the watch who've

972
01:53:19,579 --> 01:53:27,210
told me how he works now here's my plan i could bring this to

973
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:32,170
the attention of king rasner lord of the city but that would mean an

974
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:36,090
inquiry my world against the captains and when

975
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:40,010
this can be brought to evidence destroyed oh maybe the whole thing will

976
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:42,979
be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border

977
01:53:42,979 --> 01:53:47,159
again and all i'll get for my trouble is a knife

978
01:53:47,159 --> 01:53:49,960
in the ribs in time of war you see a king's eye

979
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:55,140
wanders far from his domain and the subjects suffer so i've got

980
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:57,960
another idea i've got a small group of townsfolk

981
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:01,399
together some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these

982
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:04,920
bandits and will storm the captain's home and

983
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,770
bring him in chains before king ragnar hopefully with a few captured bandits to

984
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:14,069
explain how he fucked it up so much all i need now

985
01:54:14,069 --> 01:54:16,949
is someone to lead my little army into battle and i can't think of anyone

986
01:54:16,949 --> 01:54:22,390
better than you so what do you say yeah how do i know that you're telling

987
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:25,670
me the truth oh well i suppose it's possible that i

988
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:28,069
found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing

989
01:54:28,069 --> 01:54:30,470
stranger a false impression of life and old star star god

990
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,029
oh well i guess you can't really know if my word is good but i reckon you've

991
01:54:33,029 --> 01:54:35,750
learned by now that my money is good and there's another hundred dinners

992
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:40,069
or maybe a bit more that's waiting for you if you'll do me this little last

993
01:54:40,069 --> 01:54:58,260
favor so what do you say so this could be false too much

994
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:05,420
no fuck it let's go splendid it's been a long time since i stake so much on a

995
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:08,789
single throw of the dice and frankly i find it exhilarating

996
01:55:08,789 --> 01:55:13,500
my men are ready to move on your word are you ready i don't want to be treated

997
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:18,710
like a fucking goddamn craps table where's the option to

998
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:24,170
fucking spin around i can get him on the neck yes give

999
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:31,109
them the sign good now strike hard strike fast and the

1000
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:33,350
captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them

1001
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:37,640
may the heavens be with you this guy's crazy

1002
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:50,380
me crazy streamer this is this i'm role playing you leave the tavern

1003
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:53,340
and go out to the streets nervous looking young men are waiting in

1004
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:56,460
every street corner you can say they have daggers and clubs

1005
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:01,590
concealed under their clothes and catch a mixture of fear anticipation

1006
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:04,470
and pride in the quick looks that they throw at you

1007
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:08,859
as you pass by praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all to

1008
01:56:08,859 --> 01:56:13,989
obvious bunch of plotters you check your weapons for one last time

1009
01:56:13,989 --> 01:56:25,060
and prepare yourself for the action ahead okay there it

1010
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:30,810
it's time lads up and at them these are my face what the fuck

1011
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:49,140
this guy's got a bat that guy's a fucking baseball bat

1012
01:56:49,140 --> 01:57:04,779
okay it's like a flaming fucking plus two magic sword

1013
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:17,960
now the dogs are barking there's one more guy

1014
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:22,600
looter killed by nord lord lord nord the remaining few men to scatter off to the

1015
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:26,699
town's narrow alleys only to be hunted down one by one by

1016
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:30,539
the angry townsfolk making sure that your victory is complete

1017
01:57:30,539 --> 01:57:33,739
and all the wounded have been taken care of you and the merchant head to his

1018
01:57:33,739 --> 01:57:45,100
house to review the day's events i don't think germa could be any worse

1019
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:49,819
at this game well here's the thing i i've i put all

1020
01:57:49,819 --> 01:57:54,869
my points into throwing rocks at people so if i was using the sword this would

1021
01:57:54,869 --> 01:57:57,029
probably go a lot differently but i'm doing the

1022
01:57:57,029 --> 01:58:12,140
throwing stuff why because more like 201 guys in chat told me to do it

1023
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:15,420
well done i hear you counted for one or two of the bastards and you're still on

1024
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,899
your feet you can't ask for a better outcome of a battle

1025
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:21,260
than that unfortunately about eight of my lads got themselves wounded i should

1026
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:33,670
go look on them i'm not bad at the game i just made

1027
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:37,590
bad decisions yeah it was the first time i've ever played it i'm just like

1028
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:42,550
what you you want me to do like the meta play pick like the best things possible

1029
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:46,199
in the first playthrough first time to play the game

1030
01:58:46,199 --> 01:58:58,890
no i want to throw rocks at people i want to throw rocks at people's heads

1031
01:58:58,890 --> 01:59:01,289
and that's eventually going to turn the throwing axes and that's eventually

1032
01:59:01,289 --> 01:59:06,220
going to turn into javelins and i will be unkillable in about 15

1033
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:18,649
minutes all right i got yeah i killed a couple

1034
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:26,409
of them ah well i'm proud to have done my bit along with the rest

1035
01:59:26,409 --> 01:59:30,090
yes yes now a couple of my boys have the watch captain pinned down in a back room

1036
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:34,220
with a knife at his throat i'll need to go drag him before king

1037
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,859
ragnar explained what this breach of the peace is all about

1038
01:59:36,859 --> 01:59:40,539
you don't need to be part of that though i'll tell you

1067
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:42,409
hold on enter the arena good day friend if you come to watch the tournaments you

1068
02:03:42,409 --> 02:03:45,609
came in vain there won't be a tournament here anytime soon

1069
02:03:45,609 --> 02:03:49,210
tournaments so they hold the tournaments here yes that's what i just told you

1070
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:52,170
uh you should see this place during one of the tournament fights everyone from

1071
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:57,130
this town and nearby villages comes here the crowd becomes mad with excitement

1072
02:03:57,130 --> 02:04:01,289
anyway as i said there won't be an event here soon so there isn't much to see

1073
02:04:01,289 --> 02:04:04,649
except as an official duel every now and then and of course

1074
02:04:04,649 --> 02:04:08,100
we have melee fights every day totally welcome

1075
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:11,560
the fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament so they

1076
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:15,800
have invented the training melee it's a simple idea fighters jump into

1077
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:19,399
the arena with a weapon there are no rules no teams everyone

1078
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:24,039
beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing

1079
02:04:24,039 --> 02:04:28,539
okay there is actually some of the wealthy townsmen

1080
02:04:28,539 --> 02:04:32,220
offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights

1081
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:35,420
if you can beat three opponents before going down you'll earn

1082
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:41,029
five dollars that doesn't seem worth it you'll get ten dollars for striking

1083
02:04:41,029 --> 02:04:45,670
down at least six people 25 if you can defeat 10 and 60 if you

1084
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:49,430
can survive long enough to beat 20 opponents

1085
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:55,640
if you're the last man standing you can get 250 dollars can i join

1086
02:04:55,640 --> 02:05:01,159
uh haha you would have been you would have to be out of your mind not to

1087
02:05:01,159 --> 02:05:03,479

1117
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:51,590
i was told by the tutorial maybe you shouldn't do this right now lad you

1118
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:56,789
pretty sure you maybe you should do this on a later date

1119
02:10:56,789 --> 02:10:59,350
of course i'm new to the game that's what that means that that's that's

1120
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:21,989
supposed to be an insult to me auto block makes it harder

1121
02:11:21,989 --> 02:11:27,609
look i'll turn off auto block in like an hour

1122
02:11:27,609 --> 02:11:33,300
so now what the hell am i supposed to do now need to go find stuff to do

1123
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:42,329
i want to buy a new weapon i was already here i already got a new weapon

1124
02:11:42,329 --> 02:11:51,739
all right um let's go to the tavern because they was like oh what's there to

1125
02:11:51,739 --> 02:11:56,840
do around here right you heard of anyone in the realm who

1126
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:00,979
might have a job for me king ragnar is always looking for

1127
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:06,010
mercenaries to fight in the wars let me think jarl sirdin has been asking

1128
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:09,369
around for someone who might want work i'd watch yourself with him though you

1129
02:12:09,369 --> 02:12:14,170
may want to speak with him let me think other work lords and guild

1130
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:16,890
masters often have other tasks which we don't hear about

1131
02:12:16,890 --> 02:12:21,449
the villages around here frequently need help all right i'll keep my ears open

1132
02:12:21,449 --> 02:12:27,930
all right so we got there's what was that guy's name

1133
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:38,649
just look at all these people's names that there's like a hundred jarls what

1134
02:12:38,649 --> 02:12:59,899
was that guy's name you got like a fucking bunch of them

1135
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:18,899

1136
02:13:18,899 --> 02:13:26,569
yarl all right what was this guy's name again king

1137
02:13:26,569 --> 02:13:31,180

1138
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:39,180

1139
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:46,869
vassal of king ragnar of kingdom of nords he is the lord of bullen boilin

1140
02:13:46,869 --> 02:13:51,000
builin so we're gonna go to builin where's builin view the village of builin

1141
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,880
near chalbeck castle belongs to jarl and he's

1142
02:13:55,880 --> 02:14:04,869
rich okay chalbeck castle belongs to okay so

1143
02:14:04,869 --> 02:14:08,949
we got a village it's good builin we're going to find builin it's

1144
02:14:08,949 --> 02:14:30,979
near chalbeck castle that's far fucking away so i can go here

1145
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:34,420
all right that's that's this one option is to go kind of from the

1146
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:40,460
what like cape cod in massachusetts what are the other

1147
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:50,739
scenarios there this is a virgin again ah carton things didn't go quite so well

1148
02:14:50,739 --> 02:14:53,140
as i'd hope king ragnar couldn't quite find it and

1149
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:56,739
overlooked my little breach of the peace oh he's grateful enough that i got rid

1150
02:14:56,819 --> 02:15:00,739
of his crooked captain a guard who led in bandits will

1151
02:15:00,739 --> 02:15:03,539
let an enemy army if the price is right but he can't

1152
02:15:03,539 --> 02:15:06,819
exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take

1153
02:15:06,819 --> 02:15:11,640
care of things that's not fair uh feral this is calradia my

1154
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:15,079
boy kings do what they will and the rest of us do as they must

1155
02:15:15,079 --> 02:15:18,439
he didn't string me up and instead gave me time to sell my properties

1156
02:15:18,439 --> 02:15:21,560
even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair

1157
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:24,649
price too

1158
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:27,850
she knows that's gracious enough as kings go but he's a weak

1159
02:15:27,850 --> 02:15:34,970
king as they all are here are weak kings and weak kings must always look to their

1160
02:15:34,970 --> 02:15:38,489
authority first and just a second i suppose i'll do the same in his

1161
02:15:38,489 --> 02:15:42,699
shoes anyway i wouldn't go rubbing your part in

1162
02:15:42,699 --> 02:15:47,930
this affair that's a weird way to say that i wouldn't

1163
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:52,569
go rubbing your part in king ragnar's face i didn't plan on it

1164
02:15:52,569 --> 02:15:55,930
but he's taken note of you and decided that you're not worth hanging

1165
02:15:55,930 --> 02:15:59,609
and that's something to which i'll raise a glass any day he might even have

1166
02:15:59,609 --> 02:16:03,210
work for you further down the road or you can sell

1167
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:06,729
your sword to one of his competitors anyway i hope you've learned a bit

1168
02:16:06,729 --> 02:16:09,689
about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land and i suspect that

1169
02:16:09,689 --> 02:16:13,289
the money you've earned won't go to waste good luck

1170
02:16:13,289 --> 02:16:24,500
so we can go talk to the king so let me see here we've got characters

1171

near future are you by any chance looking for some help

1283
02:30:18,649 --> 02:30:23,180
mm-hmm uh well sir as long as i can remember i've had a weakness for pretty

1284
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:25,500
things and it's gotten me into trouble you see

1285
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:29,100
i grew up in mallier castle as a bonded servant working alongside my mother in

1286
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,739
the kitchens i would just amuse myself by hunting mice

1287
02:30:31,739 --> 02:30:35,500
through the pantries and sculleries i was so gutted that i put the castle cats

1288
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:38,540
out of a job and eventually the lord realized that i might also be employed to

1289
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:42,059
track down figure game on certain errands of a type perhaps better

1290
02:30:42,059 --> 02:30:46,459
left unsaid uh needless to say i found a number of opportunities to avail myself

1291
02:30:46,459 --> 02:30:49,340
of trinkets that formerly belonged to my lord's

1292
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:53,180
enemies buy myself out of bondage and find a

1293
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:59,340
hire as a free agent my job was here unfortunately my last employer's wife had

1294
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:02,059
a lovely amulet of a kind i simply could not resist

1295
02:31:02,059 --> 02:31:04,860
she doesn't know it's missing yet but she might sue and so tell me are you

1296
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:08,969
looking for helpers this person is gonna steal shit from me

1297
02:31:11,979 --> 02:31:16,200
what can you do i may not know how to read and write but i know the quickest

1298
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,520
way to a man's heart is between his fourth and fifth

1299
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:24,120

1303
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:55,799
good so how about paying me a little something

1304
02:31:55,799 --> 02:31:59,079
to seal off our agreement a mere 200 would be enough

1305
02:31:59,079 --> 02:32:03,049
please don't take this the wrong way but i've had some bad luck with employers

1306
02:32:03,049 --> 02:32:10,139
you go fuck yourself you're not getting 200 dollars

1307
02:32:10,139 --> 02:32:17,100
me and five of my mates are looking for a master will join you for 15.96

1309
02:32:24,569 --> 02:32:34,090
what about you you do well to know me i travel a lot across colorado

1310
02:32:34,090 --> 02:32:39,909
and keep an open ear i can provide you information that you might find useful

1311
02:32:39,909 --> 02:32:45,049
um what can you tell me about this land divide into rival kingdoms which can

1312
02:32:45,049 --> 02:32:47,930
neither manage to live in peace with their neighbors nor completely eliminate

1313
02:32:47,930 --> 02:32:50,920
them as a result there's seldom a break to

1314
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:54,600
the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood

1315
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:57,559
this must be a good place to be for an adventure such as yourself

1316
02:32:57,559 --> 02:33:01,479
with some luck and skill you can make slow the fuck down

1317
02:33:01,479 --> 02:33:08,840
you're going way too fast why does everyone want to go so fast

1318
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:14,819
those kind of speeds scare me that's a that's scary speed

1319
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:23,100
you go over like 45 and i start to get nervous

1320
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:29,239
um what were we doing opportunities are endless and so are the rewards if you're

1321
02:33:29,239 --> 02:33:33,479
willing to risk your life for them tell me about these opportunities the

1322
02:33:33,479 --> 02:33:36,280
kingdoms will pay good money for missionaries if they are engaged in a

1323
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:39,700
war if you've done a bit of fighting speaking

1324
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:42,819
with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary

1325
02:33:42,819 --> 02:33:45,940
contract the real rewards however come if you can

1326
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:51,829
manage to become a vessel to a king a vessel can own villages castles

1327
02:33:51,829 --> 02:33:56,309
and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates

1328
02:33:56,309 --> 02:34:01,860
okay a king will not hesitate in time of war to accept someone who's

1329
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:04,020
distinguished himself on the battlefield as a vessel

1330
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:09,909
and grant him the right to own land not unheard of for adventures to renounce

1331
02:34:09,909 --> 02:34:15,030
allegiance to a calradian king altogether declare themselves kings and

1332
02:34:15,030 --> 02:34:17,590
claim land in their own name just like the video game

1333
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:21,270
board game risk this is a difficult path however as the great nobles of the land

1334
02:34:21,270 --> 02:34:26,229
with their long long arms are not likely to accept such upstarts

1335
02:34:26,229 --> 02:34:33,219
as their monarch okay uh it might be easier for an

1336
02:34:33,219 --> 02:34:39,930
adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival

1337
02:34:39,930 --> 02:34:43,290
there may there are many such pretenders in calradia

1338
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:47,319
those who are born to the right family who go around and stir up trouble

1339
02:34:47,319 --> 02:34:50,760
those claim holders could find supporters they could easily start civil

1340
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:57,559
wars and perhaps even replace the king give me a name a claim holder's life

1341
02:34:57,559 --> 02:35:00,920
would be in danger in his own country of course therefore they usually start

1342
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:05,180
they had rival courts i usually hear news about some of them

1343
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:07,659
and may be able to tell you their location with some precision but of

1344
02:35:07,659 --> 02:35:13,139
course i would ask for a little something um i want to know the location

1345
02:35:13,139 --> 02:35:36,100

02:42:47,059 --> 02:42:50,819
hundred dollars on his head friends of the murdered man reckon that this

1399
02:42:50,819 --> 02:42:55,620
assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at the age age

1400
02:42:56,340 --> 02:42:59,780
you might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves

03:06:36,809 --> 03:06:50,389
make i didn't do any i didn't change any options

1571
03:06:50,389 --> 03:06:56,389
uh i probably should get rid of this but yeah i'm not gonna do two-handed

1572
03:06:56,389 --> 03:07:07,899
i'm gonna keep the javelins one resistance one

1573
03:07:07,899 --> 03:07:29,590
it's zero 13 no more rocks i'm gonna keep the javelins though

1574
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:34,309
just because i could try them so this is gonna be 642 dollars that's

1575
03:07:34,309 --> 03:07:41,909
good i'll take it okay so what what are you guys talking

1576
03:07:41,909 --> 03:07:46,069
about i just loaded up the game and like started the new game i

1577
03:07:46,069 --> 03:07:50,010
didn't like let me put it on easy this is just whatever the default setting

1578
03:07:50,010 --> 03:08:11,129
is uh okay hold on uh can't pour pour

1579
03:08:11,129 --> 03:08:24,600
average average i don't good i don't know why that didn't change this

1580
03:08:24,600 --> 03:08:31,579
uh amco the terrible just gave 50 dollars

1581
03:08:31,579 --> 03:08:37,129
thank you amco the temple for 50 bucks big money

1582
03:08:37,129 --> 03:08:40,889
and they say ignore chat keep playing the way that you like and have fun with

1583
03:08:40,889 --> 03:08:46,180
the normal mode of warband is super hard and frustrating

1584
03:08:46,420 --> 03:08:55,989
just starting out just have fun i don't want you to abandon this game

1585
03:08:55,989 --> 03:09:02,520
he's what what it's right it's good advice

1586
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:05,559
increase difficulty abandon probably bullshit but

1587
03:09:05,559 --> 03:09:17,930
what uh well i can change this at any time so this is if i don't like this i'm

1588
03:09:17,930 --> 03:09:19,450
going to put it back down to where it was

1589
03:09:19,450 --> 03:09:29,190
on the default i mean turn up the battle size

1590
03:09:29,190 --> 03:09:44,040
okay damage to the player wait damage to friends damage to player

1591
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:49,799
so wait why the hell would they have this all on easy

1592
03:09:49,799 --> 03:09:53,000
as the default setting then is the game just that difficult

1593
03:09:53,000 --> 03:10:02,790
so am i am i gonna now just like lose every fight no

1594
03:10:02,790 --> 03:10:17,590
fuck that i don't know what this is on lance control what was it

1595
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:36,790
it's unforgiving lance was manual okay it's unreasonably difficult yeah i

1596
03:10:36,790 --> 03:10:39,030
think i don't know if a lot of you guys might not know

1597
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:42,870
that like this is does okay i don't know i have no idea

1598
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:46,709
but i'm getting two sides of a coin here half of you guys are saying that

1599
03:10:46,709 --> 03:10:49,750
holy shit do not do what you're doing right now this is a really bad stupid

1600
03:10:49,750 --> 03:10:52,309
idea and the other half are going like get

1601
03:10:52,309 --> 03:10:57,290
good dark souls put it on heart you know what i mean i'm just gonna do

1602

1603
03:10:59,610 --> 03:11:20,329
i'm gonna put these up that's it i'm gonna keep it the way it was

1604
03:11:20,329 --> 03:11:28,540
the fun mode is still on i mean look i understand like we have this

1605
03:11:28,620 --> 03:11:34,489
conversation sometimes if you have like 4 000 hours in warband

1606

to do with politics we're loyal servants of king yarrow glick

1845
03:49:09,659 --> 03:49:13,420
we merely govern our own affairs and pass on the townspeople's concern to our

1846
03:49:13,420 --> 03:49:18,739
lord what did you want to ask uh what do you

1847
03:49:18,739 --> 03:49:28,700
think about politics okay internal bickering in other realms

1848
03:49:28,700 --> 03:49:32,459
the lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor strategy and

1849
03:49:32,459 --> 03:49:35,659
the way a nobleman should behave they compete with each other for the

1850
03:49:35,659 --> 03:49:39,159
ruler's favor constantly weighing up their position how

1851
03:49:39,159 --> 03:49:46,969
they stand how their friends and family stand right

1852
03:49:46,969 --> 03:49:50,569
yeah it's about like oh you can sneak in and pull the rug from under somebody

1853
03:49:50,569 --> 03:49:57,430
and now you're a lord he believes that this is going to

1854
03:49:57,430 --> 03:50:00,629
change sides or rebel he may indict the vessel for treason and seize his

1855
03:50:00,709 --> 03:50:08,360
properties all right i got i'm i got nobody

1856
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:18,540
i'm not i don't i'm good all right you got any work

1857
03:50:18,540 --> 03:50:21,899
uh one of the merchants here is looking for a herdsman to take his cattle

1858
03:50:21,899 --> 03:50:26,979
we already know that's a failure i wish to buy

1859
03:50:26,979 --> 03:50:34,899
land in this town for a productive enterprise

1860
03:50:34,899 --> 03:50:40,260
uh what do i want to do a couple of things to keep in mind skilled laborers

1861
03:50:40,260 --> 03:50:43,860
are always at a premium so i doubt that you will be able to open up more than

1862
03:50:43,860 --> 03:50:48,340
one enterprise here in order to make a profit for yourself

1863
03:50:48,340 --> 03:50:51,940
you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply

1864
03:50:51,940 --> 03:50:57,819
but for which the raw materials are cheap uh they do lots of bread

1865
03:50:57,819 --> 03:51:03,780
they do a lot of bread hold on never mind

1866
03:51:03,780 --> 03:51:10,659
how's the trade we have shortages of wool

1867
03:51:10,659 --> 03:51:13,780

caravan routes to towns yeah yeah yeah okay so we need

1874
03:51:52,360 --> 03:51:58,420
how does the wealth of this region compare the rest of calradia

1875
03:51:58,420 --> 03:52:03,270
we are poorer than three towns and richer than 18

1876
03:52:03,270 --> 03:52:11,110
okay we produce less than seven towns and produce more than 14

1877
03:52:11,110 --> 03:52:15,479
production is of course this is one of those brain teasers

1878
03:52:15,479 --> 03:52:19,559
jane has six jelly beans if mark comes over

1879
03:52:19,559 --> 03:52:23,719

1880
03:52:23,719 --> 03:52:33,770
produces 12 jelly beans a day i don't want to do that

1881
03:52:33,770 --> 03:52:42,090
looting and pillage and shifts in territory can make a major impact

1882
03:52:42,090 --> 03:52:47,690
okay the village is produced less than the hinderlin around eight towns produce

1883
03:52:47,690 --> 03:52:51,379
more than 13 the wealth of a town's hinder than of

1884
03:52:51,379 --> 03:52:54,260
course is heavily dependent on the tides of war

1885
03:52:54,260 --> 03:52:59,450
the town of suno is believed to have received the most visits from caravans

1886
03:52:59,450 --> 03:53:05,799
we have visited we are less visited than four towns and more visited than 17

1887
03:53:05,799 --> 03:53:09,879
in terms of attacks on travelers the town of dirum is believed to be the most

1888
03:53:09,879 --> 03:53:13,559
dangerous here we are less afflicted by bandits

1889
03:53:13,559 --> 03:53:21,590
and raiders than 12 towns and more afflicted than nine

1890
03:53:21,590 --> 03:53:26,329
i thought that was a middle finger all right i'm gonna buy a productive

1891
03:53:26,329 --> 03:53:35,719
enterprise and it's gonna be wool a weavery to make wool

1892
03:53:35,719 --> 03:53:45,700
cloth from wool they get a shortage of it a weavery and

1893
03:53:45,700 --> 03:53:55,110
dye works to make velvet from silk and dye check how much you make each week on

1894
03:53:55,110 --> 03:54:00,229
every option very good so the land of the materials

1895
03:54:00,229 --> 03:54:04,500
on which you may build your mill will cost you 1500

1896
03:54:04,500 --> 03:54:10,180
300 dollars a week 264 and labeled with 30

1897
03:54:10,180 --> 03:54:21,510
would probably be 18 dollars a week now a brewery okay so i guess that would be

1898
03:54:21,510 --> 03:54:25,659
probably 122 dollars a week no that's not good for me at the

1899
03:54:25,659 --> 03:54:36,540
moment tannery 220 dollars a week okay i think

1900
03:54:36,540 --> 03:54:43,700
it's going to be the tannery wine press uh batch will be

1901
03:54:43,700 --> 03:54:48,899
40 i guess that your profit will be negative 148 dollars a week well then

1902
03:54:48,899 --> 03:54:52,420
uh guild master gary that's not profit that's loss

1903
03:54:52,420 --> 03:54:58,680
so um no thanks your profit will be you owe me 150 dollars that there's no

1904
03:54:58,680 --> 03:55:10,040
profit an oil press 208 that's not bad

1905
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:19,020
and iron works 42 dollars a week don't think so weavery and dye works

1906
03:55:19,020 --> 03:55:23,590
holy shit your profit will be 520 dollars a week

1907
03:55:23,590 --> 03:55:36,600
hold on so what about just what just a weavery

1908
03:55:36,600 --> 03:55:45,739
minus 50 dollars a week a weavery to make linen from flax

1909
03:55:45,739 --> 03:55:53,909
70 dollars no so that was crazy how much is that one okay so a weavery

1910
03:55:53,909 --> 03:55:58,600
and a dye works the land of the materials you right so

1911
03:55:58,600 --> 03:56:07,479
ten thousand dollars to start it and five hundred dollars a week after that

1912
03:56:07,479 --> 03:56:15,450
swindle the new king and then take the money somewhere else

1913
03:56:15,450 --> 03:56:18,729
just keep swindling people out of taxes and then

1914
03:56:18,729 --> 03:56:31,319
do tax evasion so much well it's not tax evasion that's just stealing money

1915
03:56:31,319 --> 03:56:46,200
okay oh right what if i just never come back what was i doing who was i looking

1916
03:56:46,200 --> 03:56:52,709

04:16:48,889 --> 04:16:52,649
so hard and i put the difficulty why did i listen to everybody to put the

2020
04:16:52,649 --> 04:16:55,690
difficulty up too why would i do that the game is on default

2021
04:16:55,690 --> 04:17:17,799
just play the game i pressed g instead of x

2022
04:17:17,799 --> 04:17:32,780

2380
05:27:24,900 --> 05:27:26,979
many of which are becoming overgrown with weeds

2381
05:27:26,979 --> 05:27:30,340
the rest are weak and malnourished or have already fled elsewhere

2382
05:27:30,340 --> 05:27:34,180
the draft animals have long since starved or eaten although a few carcasses

2383
05:27:34,180 --> 05:27:39,880

2913
07:15:14,700 --> 07:15:25,659
i had to move this one second uh thank you some guy for the 20 bucks

2914
07:15:25,659 --> 07:15:28,619
no meme video or phantom of the opera tonight couldn't find anything so in

2915
07:15:28,619 --> 07:15:41,580
stages a picture of my dog really that's a that's a cute dog let's

2916
07:15:41,580 --> 07:16:02,650
take a look at that dog thank you so much for the 20 bucks what

2917
07:16:02,650 --> 07:16:31,159
kind of dog is that are you still here it's a pug

2918
07:16:31,159 --> 07:16:44,330
i don't think that's a pug don't let dickheads get you down

2919
07:16:44,330 --> 07:16:49,750
you know there's nothing to do with that but if you want if you want a real talk

2920
07:16:49,750 --> 07:16:55,509
here for a second sometimes like for instance trying to

2921
07:16:55,509 --> 07:17:00,229
play a game that is a huge learning curve that requires

2922
07:17:00,229 --> 07:17:03,349
potentially hundreds of hours to understand everything

2923
07:17:03,349 --> 07:17:07,990
and for every action from the first 10 seconds

2924
07:17:07,990 --> 07:17:13,900
of in the game to be called like stupid and that i'm doing something wrong can

2925
07:17:13,900 --> 07:17:26,169
get fairly aggravating it just it can from i don't know we

2926
07:17:26,169 --> 07:17:34,169
were joking around in the beginning but if i click on the map wrong if i if

2927
07:17:34,169 --> 07:17:45,509
i don't go to the right place in the first 10 seconds

2928
07:17:45,509 --> 07:17:50,020
like the the hyper like overdrive backseating

2929
07:17:50,020 --> 07:17:53,299
and i don't know which way is which i don't know which way is correct

2930
07:17:53,299 --> 07:17:57,139
um i got a blindfold on and people shouting orders

2931
07:17:57,139 --> 07:18:22,459
and sometimes people backseat to get me to go in the wrong direction it's like

2932
07:18:22,459 --> 07:18:25,580
fuck well if i went that way and it was wrong but everyone

2933
07:18:25,580 --> 07:18:40,950
you know what i'm saying backseating for eye spy won't be as bad

2934
07:18:40,950 --> 07:19:17,610
i don't i disagree but anyways just disable chat no absolutely not

2935
07:19:35,659 --> 07:19:38,540
imagine having a chatless stream it'd just be like

2936
07:19:38,540 --> 07:20:02,169
hey it's me just sitting here in my room not saying that that was like a huge

2937
07:20:02,169 --> 07:20:11,400
issue tonight but trying to learn a game like this

2938
07:20:11,400 --> 07:20:25,770
is already frustrating on its own it's been an issue lately though

2939
07:20:25,770 --> 07:20:51,000
especially this year yeah i i don't i mean maybe a little bit

2940
07:20:51,000 --> 07:20:54,680
to secretly learn the whole street game off stream and pretend you're just

2941
07:20:54,680 --> 07:21:29,270
a god gamer or don't put all your points into throwing weapons

2942
07:21:29,270 --> 07:21:33,130
yeah but but i'm talking about jokes aside right

2943
07:21:33,130 --> 07:21:37,110
and that is actually a viable thing am i wrong to say that

2944
07:21:37,110 --> 07:21:39,590
that eventually like if you get lances and stuff and you level that up that

2945
07:21:39,590 --> 07:21:46,500
that's not like that's actually viable later on

2946
07:21:46,500 --> 07:22:20,779
it is viable right it's very viable okay viable but not for you i but i think i

2947
07:22:20,779 --> 07:22:23,099
think sometimes there's like a big disconnect

2948
07:22:23,099 --> 07:22:29,540
between like you guys got to remember i have never played this game before

2949
07:22:29,540 --> 07:22:34,950
ever some of you might have hundreds of thousands of hours in this game i

2950
07:22:34,950 --> 07:22:36,630
literally have don't even know what it is

2951
07:22:36,630 --> 07:22:40,549
i was it was requested that i play it i have no fucking idea what the hell this

2952
07:22:40,549 --> 07:23:02,700
game is i'm glad you guys are enjoying yourselves

2953
07:23:02,700 --> 07:23:07,049
but you gotta remember i i'm so blind that i

2954
07:23:07,049 --> 07:23:32,060
don't know that doing something like that is i have to learn it right he

2955
07:23:32,060 --> 07:23:49,819
doesn't know the game is pretty complicated just play

2956
07:23:49,819 --> 07:24:05,590
every game for a few hundred hours before streaming it

2957
07:24:05,590 --> 07:24:08,869
and then i think like if i'm getting my ass kicked and all of a sudden it's

2958
07:24:08,869 --> 07:24:11,669
like holy shit this guy sucks it's like do i suck

2959
07:24:11,669 --> 07:24:15,750
fuck i suck i'm not good at this game am i what did i do wrong i'm doing

2960
07:24:15,750 --> 07:24:17,590
something wrong you're doing something wrong i am

2961
07:24:17,590 --> 07:24:23,610
fuck am i it's like a it's like a circle of me

2962
07:24:23,610 --> 07:24:59,639
realizing something's wrong maybe start cracking down on it a little bit

2963
07:24:59,639 --> 07:25:07,779
chat can be real toxic sometimes it's pretty sad to watch

2964
07:25:07,779 --> 07:25:11,139
and it's like and then i i get like backed into like a corner and i'm like

2965
07:25:11,139 --> 07:25:17,270
a fucking cat and i'm like i got like two claws i

2966
07:25:17,270 --> 07:25:55,779
only have like two fingers just like toxic when one guy was actually the

2967
07:25:55,779 --> 07:26:09,849
whole guy all along but i'm not gonna harp on this anymore

2968
07:26:09,849 --> 07:26:19,020
it sucks i got i got really frustrated in the last like hour and the first like

2969
07:26:19,020 --> 07:26:21,580
six hours the first like five or six hours was

2970
07:26:21,580 --> 07:26:25,930
like so much fun i was having a great time and then it

2971
07:26:25,930 --> 07:26:31,419
like went self because of like dying to random shit

2972
07:26:31,419 --> 07:26:35,020

3023
07:33:19,180 --> 07:33:21,819
playing warband i had to leave the stream early but i

3024
07:33:21,819 --> 07:33:25,020
hope you liked the game warband has a lot of mods and maybe go

3025
07:33:25,020 --> 07:33:27,180
oh when you come back you're gonna be fucking probably pretty

3026
07:33:27,180 --> 07:33:31,659
disappointed i hope you listened the whole time because i did say the game

3027
07:33:31,659 --> 07:33:35,959
was fun and i liked it but i wasn't gonna play it again

3028
07:33:35,959 --> 07:33:40,040
it is i i made sure even in my like most frustrated i did say

3029
07:33:40,040 --> 07:33:47,209
it's a good game it's good i never said it was bad

3030
07:33:47,209 --> 07:33:50,729
you said i said it sucks as a joke though that was a joke i was just

3031
07:33:50,729 --> 07:34:04,459
making a joke anyways noctil it's a very fun game

3032
07:34:04,459 --> 07:34:07,590
i'm just probably not gonna play it again it's very like hard and

3033
07:34:07,590 --> 07:34:20,860
take complicated and maybe i'll install the star wars mod and like put it in

3034
07:34:20,860 --> 07:34:24,840
would you recommend it yeah i would i would it

3035
07:34:24,840 --> 07:34:30,330
there's okay there's a shitload of content obviously

3036
07:34:30,330 --> 07:34:35,750
there's a lot of content it's very cool it's just

3037
07:34:35,750 --> 07:34:39,259
hard hard to learn let's put it that way hard to understand

3038
07:34:39,259 --> 07:34:52,759
what's going on uh but thank you too mostly lost for the one dollar

3039
07:34:52,759 --> 07:34:56,439
chat gets mad at you for choosing easy mode but then also gets mad at you for

3040
07:34:56,439 --> 07:35:08,729
putting points into useless categories i don't get it

3041
07:35:08,729 --> 07:35:19,270
i don't see the contradiction well the contradiction is the game needs to be

3042
07:35:19,270 --> 07:35:25,430
potentially on easy for those builds to work early i guess

3043
07:35:25,430 --> 07:35:32,919
were people actually mad at easy mode no i just got i just got made fun of for

3044
07:35:32,919 --> 07:35:37,590
like 40 minutes until i changed it i shouldn't even open up the fucking

3045
07:35:37,590 --> 07:35:46,779
menu it was when we got to the c raiders and i

3046
07:35:46,860 --> 07:35:50,139
beat the c raiders with only losing like two people and it was like wait a minute

3047
07:35:50,139 --> 07:35:54,060
hold on a second what difficulty you play it on you

3048
07:35:54,060 --> 07:36:15,540
fucking monster make chat the weakest wrestler in the next germa rumble

3049
07:36:15,540 --> 07:36:19,270
uh i already did that i've done that before

3050
07:36:19,270 --> 07:36:23,509
and it came back to bite me because they did very well they eliminated like seven

3051
07:36:23,509 --> 07:36:46,819
people so i'm not sure i want to do that again

3052
07:36:46,819 --> 07:36:50,869
local streamer is peer pressured into having a bad time

3053
07:36:50,950 --> 07:36:55,340
i didn't have a bad time though i had a bad time

3054
07:36:55,340 --> 07:36:59,270
you know where it really started to unravel when i thought that when the king

3055
07:36:59,270 --> 07:37:03,740
killed me and i then when i turned into an archer

3056
07:37:03,740 --> 07:37:08,599
and shot my own guy in the back because they changed my colors that's

3057
07:37:08,599 --> 07:37:24,869
where it unraveled at about the five and a half hour mark

3058
07:37:24,869 --> 07:37:32,169
uh but thank you mostly lost so much thank you to uh a pepperoni for the

3068
07:38:23,799 --> 07:38:30,759
so hard like streamer plays warband can't handle warband rage quits

3069
07:38:30,759 --> 07:38:35,319

3072
07:38:55,139 --> 07:38:57,779
people are gonna come because no but most people don't stick around for the

3073
07:38:57,779 --> 07:38:59,540

3078
07:39:35,139 --> 07:39:40,630

3079
07:39:40,630 --> 07:39:42,950
anything i don't really get i'm not really into

3080
07:39:42,950 --> 07:39:47,990
those kind of games battle royale there it's cool but

3081
07:39:47,990 --> 07:39:54,889

3160
07:47:37,860 --> 07:47:40,900
here wizard ribbit to be fair you have to have a very high

3161
07:47:40,900 --> 07:47:43,939
scale level to understand mountain blade the game is extremely hard

3162
07:47:43,939 --> 07:47:48,020
and without a solid grasp of siege theory most of the enemies will trample a

3163
07:47:48,020 --> 07:47:51,939
typical player's army there's also king harlow's buttery outlook

3164
07:47:51,939 --> 07:47:54,900
which is definitely woven into his characterization his personal philosophy

3165
07:47:54,900 --> 07:47:58,900
draws heavily from bounty or if you go literature for

3166
07:47:58,900 --> 07:48:02,009
instance now the real gamers understand this

3167
07:48:02,009 --> 07:48:05,930
stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of

3168
07:48:05,930 --> 07:48:08,729
this game what to realize is not just hard it says

3169
07:48:08,729 --> 07:48:12,090
something deep about gaming as a consequence to people who dislike

3170
07:48:12,090 --> 07:48:15,930
mountain blade truly are not gamers of course they wouldn't appreciate for

3171
07:48:15,930 --> 07:48:19,049
instance the humor in the sea raiders existential catchphrase

3172
07:48:19,049 --> 07:48:23,290
i will drink from your skull which itself is a cryptic reference to robert

3175
07:48:33,639 --> 07:48:37,799
gamers scratching their heads in confusion as king ragnar's genius

3176
07:48:37,799 --> 07:48:40,919

3201
07:50:52,180 --> 07:50:55,459

first donation but the game has little to no tutorial

3347
08:09:26,970 --> 08:09:31,159
so early game is really rough for new players

3348
08:09:31,159 --> 08:09:37,880
yeah i kind of figured that out firsthand i got very upset

3349
08:09:37,880 --> 08:09:44,520
i got very mad and it was not nice that's what i've heard

3350
08:09:44,520 --> 08:09:47,240
i've heard it's very rough to new players and it's very difficult and the

3351
08:09:47,240 --> 08:09:58,279
learning curve is huge but people were being very mean to me

3352
08:09:58,279 --> 08:10:04,069
perfect storm of fucking potions that i drank people were being very mean to me

3353
08:10:04,069 --> 08:10:10,520
weren't they okay like that's like such confirmation like just

3354
08:10:10,520 --> 08:10:15,259
bias right guys people being mean to me right everybody

copyright free i would probably put any amount of money

3489
08:25:33,720 --> 08:25:37,180
on that that's probably very copywritten it's

3490
08:25:37,180 --> 08:25:42,330
