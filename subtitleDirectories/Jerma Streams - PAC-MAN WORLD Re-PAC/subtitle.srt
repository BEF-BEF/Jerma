1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,279
Hey, what's up? What's going on? We said that the sponsors were still in the description.

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:29,059
Yeah, well, whatever. That's fine. I fixed it. It's all right. Stop. What? It's a free ad.

3
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:39,049
No, I mean, look. Hey, they supported that show. Okay. I'm fine with that. I don't care.

4
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:53,179
You got a mustache? What do you think? Do you think it's still there? What do you think? Should

5
00:00:53,179 --> 00:01:13,560
we do another vote? Hmm. We could. Yeah, I mean, you can't if you guys want to bet on this. You

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,489
absolutely can. I just want to let you know that I have this is on you. If you bet and you lose and

7
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,370
you lose all your channel points. I'm that's not on me that you decided to do that. You don't have.

8
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,870
I would not bet on this if I this is it could be anything. This is actually just flipping a coin

9
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:41,189
in the air. You have no idea. I just do a regular poll. Don't need to do a bet. Well, there it is.

10
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,780
All right. Is it there? Oh, okay. I have nothing to do with this. I'm just saying if you get mad

11
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,140
at me after this, if I open up the chat over here and I look over and I'm like, dude, what the fuck?

12
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,659
Like you fucking scammed me out of my point. No, I didn't do anything. This is I'm not telling you

13
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:19,340
to do this. I'm gonna say this is easy points. How would you know? You wouldn't really know

14
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:35,509
that it was easy because you don't know if it's there. Are you Kappa in right now? I'm not going

15
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,669
to tell you anything because the voter the poll is still up, so I'm not going to say anything to

16
00:02:39,669 --> 00:03:01,300
you. We get some more gif emotes as sub emotes. I'm the worst streamer on Twitch in regards to

17
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:09,830
this kind of stuff. I just I don't know emotes and new things. There hasn't been a new sub emote.

18
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:19,430
I think I have like 100 slots and like 24 of them are taken up right now. Maybe I just I don't know.

19
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:29,560
But what would they even be? You know, okay, here's the thing about emotes and emote slots.

20
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:37,939
I don't know if I had this opinion years ago. Leather jacket. I fucking clicked on the button

21
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:44,389
to start a prediction and it blue screened my computer. Okay, well, wait, is it over?

22
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,379
All right, hold on. Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Is it still there?

23
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:04,389
All right, is the voting closed? Okay, here we go. Are you guys ready?

24
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:21,959
Oh, is it still there? Oh, God, is it still there? No. Sorry, everybody, if you voted

25
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:31,110
that it is there. It's not there anymore. It was it got it was so gross. I had to get rid of it.

26
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm sorry. It was just it was causing me physical pain. I know people said, dude,

27
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:52,519
you have to trim it. I'm not a facial hair person. I'm not. It looked good. No, it looked good on a

28
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,819
fucking webcam through the internet, which you guys don't understand. I have to make this very

29
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:05,610
clear to anybody watching this stream. The amount of pixels that exist on any type of webcam or

30
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,930
camera or anything, even just this right here. You're not seeing a clear picture of my face.

31
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:17,129
You're seeing a kind of clear picture. It's good enough. It's 480p or 720 or something that's

32
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,100
scaled down or scaled up. But the issue is you don't really this blends together a lot.

33
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,899
For instance, huge zit. You probably didn't even notice. Maybe you did notice that. But let me tell

34
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,350
you something in real life. Like if I go in the mirror and I lean in, it's it's ghastly. It's

35
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,639
ghastly. But you just can't see that. You can kind of tell that there's something there. But if I when

36
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,000
I had that mustache and when it's blurring and blending together from the webcam, it looks fine.

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,350
But when I lean in and I'm looking in the mirror and I got a light on, I look like a scarecrow. I

38
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,860
look like the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz. It's just like it's just these spines that they

39
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:08,310
just point in random directions. It looks bad. I mean, it's ghastly. It is. Dude, you look normal.

40
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:21,899
Yeah. You didn't even do a full shave. It's still there. Yes, I, I, yeah. But dude, okay. It's been,

41
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:36,860
when was the last time I streamed? Three days ago? Two days ago? You look like you got smoothed out

42
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:54,939
by a clothing iron. That's a really specific compliment and insult together. I know exactly

43
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:02,740
what you mean. And that's funny. But anyways, yeah. Okay. So when I shaved two days ago, three days

44
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:11,300
ago, this is what just happens when it grows back. Smoothed out by a clothing iron. Tiny face cam.

45
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,990
It's not tiny. It's a, it's a perfectly normal size. All right. So here's the deal. Here's what's

46
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,689
going on. Let me explain a few things. Ah, you're a grease ball. My hair is wet. I took a shower and

47
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,370
it's going to dry in an hour. And you're going to be like, whoa, what does your hair look like?

48
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,290
Why does your hair look like shit today? It's because it's just wet and then it just dries.

49
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:40,170
I didn't put any product in my hair. I'm going to turn this way and it's going to be like this big

50
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,540
poof. And people are going to get a screenshot. Like zoom in right there. See his hairline is

51
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:52,579
going back. Do you see? Yeah, it is good. I can't wait to be ugly. Can I tell you? I can't wait till

52
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:59,079
I'm a gross old man just sitting there like, like skin sagging down like to here. I can't wait till

53
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:11,769
I'm fucking gross and old. Cause I'll tell you, well, let me, when you cross like 30, like 35,

54
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:19,129
yeah, I, you kind of don't really care that much about, oh my, I say when I turned 30 on my 30th

55
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:26,569
birthday, uh, I noticed that I had some thinning hair and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no,

56
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:32,409
it can't be. No, not yet. I'm 30. No, no, no. Maybe if I can individually give each one of these

57
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,370
vitamins, dude, I would put olive oil in my hair, olive oil and tea tree oil. I would do like this

58
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,389
slurry and I would put it all in my head. I would put olive oil all over my head back when I was

59
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:48,710
30, 31. I was terrified of losing my hair. I was like, no, I can't, I can't, I can't go. Uh, so I

60
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:53,370
just, you know, read all these concoctions and, oh, you know, like tea tree oil stimulates hair

61
00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:01,059
growth. I started drinking a lot of, uh, you know, a lot more water, a lot of green tea. Uh, and

62
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:10,009
I mean, at some point I kind of just gave up on that. I didn't really care anymore. So, uh, after

63
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:17,179
like 35, I'll tell you, if you're concerned about kind of your hair, if you're a guy and you're

64
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:24,779
concerned about hair loss, you go from this mode of, oh, this can't be happening to me. At some

65
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,340
point in, in your, in your twenties or your late twenties, early thirties, whatever it is, whenever

66
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,590
it starts to thin. And then you kind of just go, you know what? People age. Who cares? People age.

67
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,710
That's what happens when you turn 30, 40, 50. You age. Who cares? That's fine. I don't have a problem

68
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:51,590
with it anymore. How come you do the lamest shit when you get back from an event? I mean, like

69
00:09:51,590 --> 00:10:01,929
Pac-Man? What are you talking about? Pac-Man world is, is lame. I, I mean, I guess that's your, you

70
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:14,379
know. This is my first what? You don't like Pac-Man world? Well, I'll tell you, Chatter. This was voted

71
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:28,330
on before the stream started. This was voted on by a bunch of your peers. So, um, you got other people

72
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:46,309
to be upset with. Your classmates, yeah. Dude, the olive oil. What'd you say? Dude, do baseball. It's way

73
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:56,389
cooler. Dude, I should just do another baseball stream. I actually like want to. So bad. I so badly

74
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,960
want to do that again. But it, you know, whatever. You move on. The next one. But anyways, we're going

75
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,970
to play Pac-Man world. What was I just talking about? It was something I was going to bring up

76
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:15,990
and I don't remember what it was. What the hell were we just talking about? No, before hair. Before

77
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:32,309
the hair loss thing. It was after mustache and before hair. Being old. No, that was part of the

78
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:40,330
hair. Eh, sorry. All right, I got a controller here. This is Pac-Man world. Oops. Being old?

79
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:49,129
Showering. I don't remember. Who cares? Does it really matter at this point? Camera. Yeah, we're

80
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:55,019
going to play Cult of the Lamb. That was on the poll. I'm telling you, you had. This is very. Why

81
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:03,419
is this so loud? Yeah. Cult of the Lamb and Sorcery Part 3 are going to be this week as well

82
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:13,639
as something else that I will be participating in. Um, I don't want to like announce it before

83
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:42,409
somebody else does. Maybe let me ask. Let me see if I can just announce it. But maybe I shouldn't.

84
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:49,289
Oh, fuck. I already said it, didn't I? I already did say it. That's right. I said it in the pre-stream

85
00:12:49,289 --> 00:13:01,909
chat. Oh, oh, whatever. If I get confirmation, I'll formally announce it. Leak Andy. No, not

86
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:09,990
Leak Andy. All right, I'm ready. We're going to play Pac-Man world. The lamest thing I've done

87
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:21,750
since baseball. So let's go ahead and go. Start with English. OK, yes. Um, I have to be really

88
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:28,200
honest. I've put up this facade for a very long time and I'm like coming to terms with it right

89
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,419
now. I don't care about Pac-Man at all. Like I don't really like, oh, here we go. Pac-Man world.

90
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:41,269
Everyone, let's go. All the Pac-Man music. I kind of like don't care about any. Like I'm sitting here

91
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:47,029
going, oh, man, let's get hype for Pac-Man. It's a Pac-Man party. I mean, I think Pac-Man is cool,

92
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:54,519
but do I think he's this cool? I don't think so. All right, let's turn it up. Got seen. I mean,

93
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,559
he's cool. I do. Have I been pretending that I have to play every Pac-Man game that comes out?

94
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:24,519
Pac-Man made you. Now that's fair. Who is this? Who is Pac-Man?

95
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,480
Pac-Man's naked. Doesn't have like Spongebob pants on. Why is it weird for me to look at right now?

96
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,000
Isn't that weird? Something's weird about this. What is it? Why is it so different?

97
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,610
I don't know.

98
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:20,120
Pac-Mom. Doesn't he have pants on in Smash Brothers? Hold on. Whoa, this is actually 3D.

99
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, God, this is 3D. All right, hold on. Probably just got cut off. Wait, hold on. What does he look

100
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:40,649
like in Smash Brothers? Pac-Man Smash Brothers. Yeah, he does have. Yeah, that's right. I guess

101
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:47,879
I'm just, I just don't remember. I don't know why this is so weird for me to look at right now.

102
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:56,070
Okay, I'm back. All right, welcome to Pac-Man world. Over there is the ghost area. Watch out

103
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:02,309
for ghosts and eat all the Pac-Dots. The big dots are power pellets. Eat them to power up Pac-Man

104
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:08,169
and get the ghosts. Don't get careless. Power pellet effects wear off after a while. Yeah, I've played

105
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,710
fake fan. All right. Oh, wait a minute. This is actually pretty sick.

106
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:41,820
Wait, you can break stuff? What does B? How long does this last? All right, cool. Very cool. Oh,

107
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:52,259
Pac-Coins. This is a slot metal. Hang on to it and you'll be glad you did later. Wait, you can

108
00:16:52,259 --> 00:17:01,779
throw shit? Wait, you can throw grenades. All right, cool. What does it want to do? Be careful,

109
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:08,259
Pac-Man. There are a lot of enemies up ahead. Try taking them out with the button dots. Okay.

110
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,980
Do you have any Pac-Dots? You can press B to perform a Pac-Dot attack. You have lots of dots

111
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:23,619
hold to charge a bomb attack. Is there a lock on? All right, that's pretty fun. How do you open chests?

112
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:36,630
What was that? Wait, this is like a Yoshi thing. Go back, go back, go back. Oh, did I miss something?

113
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:48,859
I mean, I'm 100%ing the game, so I feel you. What did I miss? No, did I miss something?

114
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:58,730
I already said Dollar General Andy. What does that mean? There's bananas up there. Oh,

115
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:09,019
there are bananas in the trees. You're right. Cool. All right, let's go. Oh, that's how you...

116
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:16,119
Ah, all right. So, that's what I'm missing. Cool. Oh, my God. It's been so... I've been waiting this

117
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:23,079
game for like 10 years. I'm going to really cherish it. I press A to float to the surface.

118
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:42,089
All right. How do I get down there? Oh, you can just float. So, if you're not a big Pac-Man fan,

119
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:49,769
that's fine. This is a remake of an old game for a big PlayStation. Pac-Man World, I believe,

120
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:58,250
was 1998? Scream already. I've screamed twice in 10 minutes of the stream starting. All right,

121
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,170
ban that guy for as long as it takes for them to understand what they did wrong,

122
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:10,470
which is probably two minutes. Okay, press them with a butt bounce. The green switch

123
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:20,089
only works one time. What does it do? Oh, all right. This is cute. What's wrong with this?

124
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:27,619
This is cute. This is a cute game. This is way better than Glover. I'll tell you,

125
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:33,299
factually. What matter of absolute fact? This is way better than Glover. A hundred times better.

126
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,380
And I love Glover. Glover is like one of my favorite N64 games.

127
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,960
Okay, when the switches effect wears off, this one only lasts a certain amount of time.

128
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,779
Just testing. That's a trampoline. Aim at the center with a butt bounce and bounce into the

129
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:08,579
air. But not before I go get the sneakers. Okay. Cool. All right. How do I get? Oh,

130
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:15,900
you can do a Sonic the Hedgehog bounce. Cool. Is this game hard or is this for actual kids?

131
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,920
Jump at the water surface to do a dolphin jump. Use it to get items above the water. Yep. Butt

132
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,240
bouncing. Treasure chest in the water. Needs something to do that though. All right. That's

133
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:38,579
fine. What's in here? Metal dot from the treasure chest. Metal dots allow you to walk underwater

134
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:49,779
while you're metallic. You're invulnerable. What's that? What's a goal? What's the actual goal of

135
00:20:49,779 --> 00:21:01,059
this game? Is it like Banjo Kazooie? Is it kind of like Mario? Do I have to collect stuff? I think

136
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:07,240
I'm going to beat this game like in the next three hours. I think I'm going for it. Okay.

137
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,160
You've reached the checkpoint. Yep. Start over. Have you tried the rev roll? Hold Y and let go.

138
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:27,750
You can climb steep hills by using a rev roll. Really? Don't. I'm gonna. You can take those

139
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:36,140
enemies by hitting them with the rev roll. That's actually kind of fun. Oh, this game is pretty fun.

140
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:53,180
Okay. That's a elevator. Hit on a press Y to open the gate in front. Did I miss anything?

141
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,509
Look out. You can fall from here. Hold X while jumping to hang in midair. Try it if you're about

142
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:17,930
to fall. Okay. Easy enough. What's that? Oh! All right. What's this mean? What does it say? Two?

143
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:34,140
What does that say? Is that a two? Did I miss something? Blue switches are the strangest

144
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,490
switches. Pressing one lets you press two. Okay. Go back and. Okay. That's what it means. I get it.

145
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:49,880
This game looks pretty decent so far. Yeah. It actually kind of does. All right. Fuck all that.

146
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:06,579
What? What just happened? Okay. Cool. All right. What does that thing do? Is that just a button?

147
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,500
This is a fruit door. There are switches, bonus letters, and other things to find on the other

148
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,460
side. Sometimes there are even keys to rescue your friends with. Open all the fruit doors to

149
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:31,160
rescue your friends. How do you open the fruit door? I need an apple? How do I get an apple?

150
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:38,490
Pressing the yellow switch will cause DOS or power pills to appear. Oh, there we go. All right.

151
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:54,980
Do I have? Oh, that's what I got with my inventory. Cool. Let's go. The ghost boss

152
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,180
Hawkman statue is up ahead. See if you can smash it. I don't. Oh, I missed the thing with

153
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:14,680
top. I didn't think it was going to do that. Oh yeah. Here we go. Let's do it. Slot bonus.

154
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:31,640
So how do I bet? Okay. I got three coins. Do I have to stop it? Is this an? Is this a? All right.

155
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,440
We're looking for a banana. Banana. Stop. What are you doing? That wasn't a banana.

156
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:50,599
That was not even close. That was a lemon. Idiot. Banana. Stop. Do it again. Okay. So you need to do

157
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:58,420
two, one or two before. So where's the orange? Orange. Okay. It's banana. Orange. But what's

158
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,430
before banana? Cherry. Okay. Cherry. Stop on cherry. What are you talking about? I have no idea

159
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:15,380
what's going on. Can you read? I mean, can I read? All right. Peach.

160
00:25:15,380 --> 00:26:03,099
I just made a million dollars. What did I just get? No miss. 10,000. One 10,000 one up.

161
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:17,690
All right. Cool. That's a good start. Corsairs Cove episode unlocked. Oh cool. I think should

162
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,210
two headphones go in for this? Oh man. That's actually kind of fun. I'm kind of excited. I'm

163
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:29,019
kind of excited. Pirate ship area. Choose your destination. All right. I guess I'm just going

164
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:52,630
to do this. All right. What's this? What is this thing? View movies in credits. Oh, we didn't watch

165
00:26:52,630 --> 00:27:06,069
this. Oh, we got to watch this. We have to see what happens. Happy birthday. Whose birthday is it?

166
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:18,069
Oh my God. That looks good. If we wouldn't see them up there.

167
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:39,990
Pac-Man, just pick up a rock and throw it up there. Who's the dog? Is this a Pac-Man dog?

168
00:27:44,900 --> 00:28:01,700
What? So wait, Pac-Man has to eat a pellet for a ghost to get hurt. What is that? What are the

169
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,859
rules there though? Like if I eat a power pellet and I throw a rock at a ghost, will it hit? Will

170
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:20,039
it hurt them? Do I have to physically bite them? Well, that doesn't make any sense because they

171
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:25,910
just pick, they just pick that guy up. There's obviously physical stuff going on. They're able

172
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:34,490
to touch and pick up things in the world. So you're telling me if I threw that, if I,

173
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,130
if I smash that glass pitcher over a ghost head, that it's going to go through them. That doesn't

174
00:28:39,130 --> 00:29:03,450
make any sense. You're a fake fan. I'm just kidding around. I'm just messing around. I'm

175
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,569
just kidding around. I'm just messing around. I'm just messing around. I'm kidding. I'm just

176
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:19,180
messing around. Okay. But what if one of the ghosts, okay, what if, hold on, I actually have

177
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,259
a question. So the ghost, when Pac-Man eats a pellet, he turns into the Pac-Man thing. You

178
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:29,700
can eat the ghost turn blue. Could, could a ghost get like struck by lightning and die?

179
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,059
Like, could a ghost get like an anvil dropped on their head and die if it had nothing to do

180
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:54,250
with like a Pac-Man pellet? They already did that. All right, let's go. I'm ready. There's one.

181
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:13,109
Can you drown? I need a, I need a metal Mario. Is there a metal thing here?

182
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:41,819
Shit. Lemon. All right, let me up. All right, let's blow through this. Oh, what? Oh, cause they're

183
00:30:41,819 --> 00:31:01,049
ghosts. Okay. Well, that fucks my whole logic up. Wait. Oh my goodness. All right. I got it.

184
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:19,960
All right, let's go. You're an idiot. I'm not an idiot. I didn't know that you had to, whatever.

185
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:34,410
I didn't know those were ghosts. They were pirates. Fuck off. Wait, give me this. Is there

186
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:45,529
another metal Mario anywhere? There's right here. Hold on. How do I get up there? How did you not

187
00:31:45,529 --> 00:32:02,680
know? I mean, I know, I, I know how it, how it works. I just, it's a 3d platformer. Is it not

188
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:20,890
here anymore? So I need another metal Mario thing. Is there one over here? I don't think you can

189
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:36,740
drown. I don't think so. It doesn't feel like it. Can't go that way. Wall jump. This definitely,

190
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:49,480
I probably unlock it in a minute. What about the door? Oh, you definitely can't drown. I would have

191
00:32:49,480 --> 00:33:12,619
drowned already. I feel like I missed a bunch of shit. Did I? Go back, go back. That made me so

192
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,700
mad. Did you see it? I'm glad I have the camera on because I was actually fucking mad for one

193
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,769
tenth of a second. It was just like, why'd you do that? Here we go. All right, we're good.

194
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:49,420
All right, gotta be quick. Strawberry. Can I get it again? Yeah, I felt my, my face go

195
00:33:50,299 --> 00:34:04,279
like this. Oh, this P for Pac-Man. Idiot. I like the sound when he walks. I think this is a cute

196
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:18,619
game. How much is this game? There it is. Is the A? I don't know, dude. You bought it. I don't,

197
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:31,670
I don't know. I don't remember. I bought it a while ago when it first came out. Still don't have that.

198
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:48,710
30 bucks. I knew it was under like 30 or 40. There it is. Dude, you were waiting at game stuff at

199
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:57,289
midnight for this. Imagine getting that phone call. This is GameStop, where you can buy and

200
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:01,690
sell used games and make sure to check out Sonic the Hedgehog. It's coming out. By the way,

201
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:07,420
can I get an interview and pre-ordering Sonic the Hedgehog? No, thank you. When does, do you

202
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:17,269
guys do a midnight release for Pac-Man World Repack? Yeah, you betcha, man. Okay. Yeah,

203
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:20,550
should I write your name down as literally the only fucking person that's going to be here?

204
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:42,630
Yeah. Okay. Ooh, nice, nice, nice. Give me it. And then at midnight, I just don't go.

205
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:52,789
It's like, no, that's actually, I don't like, that's dumb. Don't they usually do the midnight

206
00:35:52,789 --> 00:36:00,980
releases for different, you know, at the same time? Like it'd be, oh, you, but you can get

207
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:12,650
Pac-Man World Repack or The Witcher 3, right? Don't they usually do that? I need to see. Yeah,

208
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:21,940
where is it? I'm looking, I'm like looking at chat. I'm not looking. Yeah, guys, I might be

209
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,679
going like moving the character, but I'm, I'm reading what you're saying. Stop reading chat.

210
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,059
No, I will never stop reading chat. I will never stop picking up the one person here

211
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:39,099
that says that my hair looks like a mustache or that it looks like my room smells like fucking

212
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:45,050
pee, but I'm not going to, I'm going to always read this. Like, Hey dude, it looks like your

213
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,409
room smells like pee. I'm going to read, I'm going to read that. So like, I'm going to all be,

214
00:36:48,409 --> 00:37:04,469
I'm going to be looking over here all the time. Where is it? Where is it? You guys told me I

215
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:13,699
missed it. Where? Get the C. I don't, I don't, there's no C here. Where is it? What letter is

216
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:36,900
that? Oh, how do I get that? Where's the C? Did you actually see it somewhere? Do I have that item?

217
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:47,510
How do I look? I want whatever that is. Did you guys actually see the C? I promise I'm

218
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:57,260
not being a fucking weirdo. Did anybody actually see it? No, I got to go back.

219
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,670
I'm going to die in this game and it's going to be embarrassing in level one.

220
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:27,059
Hmm. Oh my God. I just got so much. Now what? I can open the door down here. What is this?

221
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:40,619
You got a maze. Oh, okay. I've got to get everything. If I don't get every single one

222
00:38:40,619 --> 00:39:55,639
of these out, delete my Twitch channel. You have to stick around. That was actually really close.

223
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:03,530
That was way too close. I was very uncomfortable. I know it's a joke, right? But I was uncomfortable

224
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:25,590
that whole time. I was, I was, I was not doing okay. Okay. You would have done it. No, I would

225
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:31,829
have found some dumb way to say, oh, well, I'll delete my Twitch channel in, you know, eventually

226
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:41,349
in 10 years. Or I would have said something dumb. Don't worry. I have really all that did.

227
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:52,840
Where? I honestly, guys, where's the C? I'm going to, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it,

228
00:40:52,840 --> 00:41:09,539
right? Oh, wait, careful. Those are metal enemies. Oh, there it is. Perfect. Wait,

229
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:23,179
I don't have that. Sit. There we go. I'm going to be able to do a lot of slot machine stuff later.

230
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:49,449
All right. Sneed the end. I thought I just got hurt. Change the music. Uh, guys, I'm sorry. I

231
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:55,619
cannot, I can't just turn on a different OST. This is what the game soundtrack is. And it's

232
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,940
cute. It's fine. You can't just put on blocked OST for every single game I play.

233
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:13,210
Give me, come on, give me some slack. All right. I got all, I got Pac-Man.

234
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:24,760
I thought I had to go in there from the bell or something at the end.

235
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,170
Oh my goodness. There's a lot of shit back here. Uh, let me get, hold on,

236
00:42:32,170 --> 00:43:03,750
don't get too far ahead. No, not yet. Can't jump this. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What's that?

237
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:15,210
Ooh, a key. Why would you want to change this music?

238
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:26,300
Pac-Man music. Doesn't everybody universally love, whatever. I thought everybody universally loved

239
00:43:26,300 --> 00:44:03,880
Pac-Man music. Ooh, wait, I'm going to do this. Yep. Oh, wait. Bonus stage. That was a fake

240
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:30,469
reaction, but whatever. I'll take it. Bonus stage. Oh, okay. I got it. Oh, I can't get it.

241
00:44:42,869 --> 00:45:04,489
Got them all. What do I do here? I got five spins. This is going to be huge. All right.

242
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:22,090
Can I max bet? Can I bet everything I have in one spin? Yep. I got to try to get the, uh, the

243
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:37,800
spaceship. Where's the spaceship? Okay. It's one, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three,

244
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:51,099
four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six, six, four,

245
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:57,579
one, two, three. How did I do that? How did I mess that up? How is that possible? I don't know

246
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:09,460
what happened. That's fucked up. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five,

247
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:39,110
six. That's okay. What a dork. Give it. Let's do it. I'll get it this time. Ready? One, two,

248
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:48,389
three, four, five, six. One, two, three. This music beat is fucking me up. One, two, three, four,

249
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:54,630
five, six. One, two, three. Why is my voice getting deeper? What's that? Whoa. What the

250
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,949
fuck is going on? No, I was like going, I was getting, I was, I was, what the fuck kind of gas

251
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:24,730
was I just inhaling? Two, one, two, three. Oh my God. Whatever. I got, I won once. I'm fine.

252
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:37,480
I have 14 extra lives guys. Sorry. 18. I have 18 lives. I don't think I'm going to use more

253
00:47:37,480 --> 00:48:03,369
than two of these. So don't worry. Crazy cannonade. I almost have the area one boss. When are you

254
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:12,760
going to finally play Eve Online? Um, isn't that the game where sometimes it takes like five years

255
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,539
for there to be real like geopolitical fights and stuff. And after like a half decade,

256
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:26,570
there's like a battle and you just lose everything. That's that game is intense.

257
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:35,530
You want to talk about a roguelike. One run could take four or five years.

258
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:45,860
That's a really cool concept for a game. I will say, but I just, I'm, I'm way too impatient for it.

259
00:48:47,530 --> 00:49:02,340
You didn't think I was going to get up here, did you? It just excels spreadsheets in an MMO.

260
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:11,670
Wasn't there something that happened? Uh, not that long ago. It was like the biggest Eve Online

261
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:17,110
fight ever in history. It was like thousands of people. It was like the ultimate, it was like

262
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:31,059
the infinity war. When was the Eve Online end game? It was pretty recently, wasn't it? Five

263
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:38,900
years ago. It was the fountain war. Why are people batch testing? Oh, it's because I said, I said

264
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:50,570
Marvel. Oh, I got to get up there. Did I just ruin my chance to get up there? The enemies respawn.

265
00:49:51,849 --> 00:50:09,449
Come on. Did I really ruin it? I don't think I can get up there. There it is. All right, we're good.

266
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:36,019
Is that, that's not the fruit I need. I need an apple. The Eve Online big battle nearly cost

267
00:50:36,019 --> 00:51:01,289
$400,000 in damages. Oh my God. That's crazy. Oh, okay. $400,000. I would be so scared to play that

268
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:13,900
kind of game. And whenever I play an MMO, I always want to hold onto every single thing I've ever

269
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:32,010
collected. So thinking and knowing that I could, you could lose a half of a decade of progress

270
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:38,250
and you just spawn and that guy stole it over there. Part of that group or that team, whatever.

271
00:51:38,889 --> 00:52:09,059
Hold on now. That's the first time that's been possible. It looks like Mario 3D world. It says

272
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:24,250
Pac-Man world repack. Wait, what am I doing? Why can I hit the back wall? The wall, that's the

273
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:32,760
the art in the background. How is that possible? Why can I hit the background art?

274
00:52:40,170 --> 00:53:04,260
Hold on. Let's go. I thought I could move it.

275
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:17,179
I thought I could move it as the big easy mode. Oh my God. What is easy mode?

276
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:28,550
I'm getting, I'm getting Luigi right now. What is that? No, no, you can hang for a long time in the

277
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:49,289
air. Okay. Let Luigi play. You know, I always say that I've never played that game. I just know that

278
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:57,059
that's, you know, maybe I have. No, I didn't. I hated it. That's right. That's right. I played

279
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:05,400
Super Mario 3D world and I hated every second of it. I really did. I thought it was the worst Mario

280
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:12,710
game ever. I thought it was so awful. I hated every waking moment of playing that game. I'm sorry. I

281
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:22,420
had the same conversation a couple of years ago about it. I know it's a weird opinion, but I really

282
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:29,769
did. I just, I didn't like it at all. And I always go into stuff with an open mind. I really do.

283
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:41,340
Especially a Mario game. You know, Mario Galaxy. Oh my God. Right. Mario Galaxy. Mario Sunshine.

284
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:49,480
Mario 64. I love that shit. 3D world or 3D land? What was the side scrolling one?

285
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:56,760
Oh, the side scrolling news. New Super Mario Brothers Wii. That's what I'm thinking of. No,

286
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,719
not 3D world. New Super Mario Brothers Wii with the two tones. That one sucks. That one sucks.

287
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:12,789
Ass. That's the one I'm thinking of. I need the A. No, not Mario Maker. I'm talking to... Oh my God.

288
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:28,969
Where's the A? I don't think, I think I can't get it. I can't go back. I can't go back.

289
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:49,780
The A is gone forever. I can't go back. Oh well. Wait. No, I can't make that. I can't go back.

290
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,840
Yeah. New Super Mario Brothers Wii. The one where you stuck the walls. Oh my God.

291
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:29,769
That was so bad. That's how far you can throw this? Can I aim it anywhere else? That's so bad.

292
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:55,940
Do I have the orange? Wait, that's not right. Wait a minute. This is a long one.

293
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:21,159
I think I just walked out. No. That's the M. Shit. Oh well. You can't get everything.

294
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:30,179
All right. I got to come back here because there's a bonus level. Can I climb that or anything?

295
00:57:31,059 --> 00:58:02,980
Jump on his head. There it is. Okay. Made it. People play the Pac-Man games actually?

296
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:10,840
Um, yeah. I mean, I'm doing it right now. I'm here right now playing it. Wish I could have done

297
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:41,449
that before. Don't come over here. If I don't get all these, if I don't get every single one of these,

298
00:58:41,449 --> 00:59:34,230
I will, I will eat my Twitch channel. You already did that joke. Yeah. Reuse joke, Andy. I guess

299
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:43,659
that I missed the A. All right. Let me ask you guys this question. What do you think is the best

300
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,920
Mario video game that has come out ever? And I'm talking across every platform. By the way,

301
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:59,369
there are some that are grayed out. Mario 64 is grayed out as well as Super Mario World for the

302
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:05,820
SNES. Those are both grayed out. You cannot pick those. They're grayed out. There are,

303
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:18,570
there are SS tier. You can't touch them. Odyssey. Odyssey was very, yeah. Odyssey was very good.

304
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:27,699
Honestly, it was very good. I still think it's probably Galaxy. Although Galaxy made me puke.

305
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:30,099
Well, I didn't actually throw up, but it made me feel like I was going to.

306
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:49,239
What's the wrong button? Good thing I have a lot of lives. What did I say? I was going to go through

307
01:00:50,199 --> 01:01:02,619
the whole game. That was inaccurate. I need to switch that right now. Okay. In every single

308
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:08,860
video game you've ever played, is it hang in midair? Is the jump button again, but I can't

309
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:22,260
make it that right. It's usually like a, right? A, but it's a in an X. That feels weird.

310
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:37,610
God damn it. I want to hover. I don't want to fall straight down. I want to go like this,

311
01:01:37,610 --> 01:02:07,050
but I have to hit the, it's not jump. What is this? Oh, okay. Let's go.

312
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:28,170
Oh my God. Get out the fucking way. No, I missed the other A.

313
01:02:40,840 --> 01:03:07,059
Greedy Gary. That's me. All right. All right. Let's go. Did I miss the end? I might have.

314
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,880
I don't even know why this moves in the game. It's truly bad.

315
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:28,760
Lower the game volume. I'm trying to sleep. Dude, just lower the stream volume. Lower the stream

316
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,960
volume. You have a volume control. Hold up your, just click, click, click, click down a few times.

317
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:42,900
You can do that on your own. I don't have to do that. What, you know, what would have been really

318
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,019
funny is if you said, Hey, Jerma, can you turn down your screams audio? I'm too lazy to do it myself.

319
01:03:48,019 --> 01:04:08,789
That would have been like, all right, that's funny. Why does it feel like I can go down there?

320
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:45,750
I don't know why. I just, I saw the sand, whatever. I spam and spamming lower your voice.

321
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:55,699
I'm watching this at full volume at my mother's funeral. That would, that would, that's very odd.

322
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:13,940
Full volume. You see, the thing is you're just going to look like a fucking lunatic, right?

323
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:23,659
That's, that's, I have nothing to do with this. Oh, it's ticked up. They're not going to think

324
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:27,179
you're watching a stream. They're going to think you're playing Pac-Man really loudly.

325
01:05:30,489 --> 01:05:36,920
That's all. The only thing is that you can really decipher it. You're just going to hear like,

326
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,239
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You're just going to be like this. Oh my God. What are you

327
01:05:43,239 --> 01:06:04,809
doing? Stop swearing in front of your mom's coffin. Imagine. I can't believe this. I hit my mom's

328
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:11,030
funeral. This guy. Can you, can you believe what this guy's saying? Oh my God. I'm so bad. All

329
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:22,010
right. I'm going to try to actually get it. One and a two and a three and a four and a one and a two

330
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:42,550
and a three and a four. It's gotta be faster. This is how I can keep tempo. Six, five,

331
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:55,320
two, three, four, five, six. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

332
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:22,980
One, two, three, four, one, two, three. Start over. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, three,

333
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:48,389
four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, whatever. I'm sweating through this shirt.

334
01:07:48,389 --> 01:08:08,380
What's happening? I wonder what the bosses are like. Hey dude, can you speak up? I'm in a

335
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:27,260
construction site. Okay. This is important. Okay. I got something. Bear with me for one minute.

336
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,859
I'm going to try to be very straight faced about this and see if I can do it.

337
01:08:32,100 --> 01:09:14,380
Oh, like this is, this is just a ton of work going on. They're building a skyscraper next to me.

338
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:27,640
This sounds pretty good. 10 hours of construction sounds. This is challenge. Watch the full video.

339
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:47,420
This is too obvious. It's gotta be way louder than me, right? Like I gotta turn myself down.

340
01:11:53,979 --> 01:13:11,270
Is it fine now? Okay. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. I don't know if I can take that.

341
01:13:13,270 --> 01:14:00,260
I was like, why is it still on? That was this. It's still on. We're good. Oh, it's because I,

342
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:19,239
whoops. Uh-oh. It's evil Pac-Man. Oh, I had to turn that off. This is still on.

343
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:39,699
Windbag. This will be the time for you to be able to throw a grenade, Pac-Man.

344
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:59,449
I don't get it. I mean, does it have to hit something? Did that work? Why is this audio

345
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:42,699
sound like it's a compressed YouTube video? Oh, it's firing back. What? Oh, shit. All right.

346
01:15:46,659 --> 01:16:37,619
I knew it was going to get faster. Um, what? Do peach? All right. One more hit and that's it.

347
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:53,819
Got it. This is your worst stream. 10 out of 10. Sorry about the construction, dude.

348
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:58,439
I'm really sorry about the construction. Yeah, I banned that person. I banned that person for

349
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:01,560
like at least a day. I banned that person for a full day and missed everything because of that.

350
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:09,079
I want that person banned for a day, at least 24 hours. Oh my God. I missed everything.

351
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:12,359
What the fuck? That was everything. That was so much coins and shit.

352
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:31,020
Permanently banned that person. No, no, no, no, no. Permanent ban is like 10 minutes.

353
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,140
Saying I'm going to ban you for a day means you're going to be gone for like a month.

354
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,579
Saying ban that person for 10 minutes means don't actually ban them at all.

355
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:56,520
I'm looking at the mod chat. So do you actually want us to ban that guy or not?

356
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,039
Question marks. Like four people have written question marks in the mod chat.

357
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:29,350
Five, no. Um, no. Three, five, six, go. One, two, three, four, five, six, go. Fuck you.

358
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:46,220
Is it Lemonworth? Yeah, it was so confusing. It happened at a weird timing. Whatever.

359
01:18:47,100 --> 01:19:12,899
I thought this was Pac-Man. It is Pac-Man. There's slot machines in Pac-Man.

360
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:21,720
Please don't ban me. I'm not going to ban you. I'm kidding.

361
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:32,470
All right. So I think we're almost. Wait a minute. Our best friend Dig Dug is here.

362
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:42,199
Oh, this is Pooka. OK. Oh, so we have like a friend. This is pretty sick.

363
01:19:46,069 --> 01:19:48,949
Pac-Man will go to any lengths to beat you, Pac-Man. Be careful.

364
01:19:49,510 --> 01:20:07,050
You kind of look like Pac-Man. I think I did it right. Or is this a.

365
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:09,850
Yep, that's a wooden bag. All right, let's go to the next area.

366
01:20:13,819 --> 01:20:18,460
You have a void expression. Pac-Man is very. Look, this is a void expression.

367
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:27,180
He's smiling. Really? That's a void expression.

368
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,619
He's looking how happy he is. Like, yeah, that's fine.

369
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:45,619
Oh, there's a space area. Oh, and let's go to the first level.

370
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:54,060
Oh, I can switch between them.

371
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,779
Fast travel. I guess that makes sense eventually if you want to go back.

372
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:07,899
All right, let's go. I think we're going to get a cool music change.

373
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:15,060
People are going to be very excited about this.

374
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:20,590
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

375
01:21:23,789 --> 01:21:34,859
That hurt. Wait, something up there?

376
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:56,069
No. All right. That's good.

377
01:21:56,069 --> 01:21:59,369
You do the jackhammer sounds with your mouth.

378
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:06,390
Oh, probably.

379
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:38,869
And tried. Oh, lemon.

380
01:22:38,869 --> 01:22:41,390
I want maximum coins for maximum gambling.

381
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:58,140
I'm not even touching it.

382
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,579
No, I don't get that.

383
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:14,720
I don't get hit. What am I supposed to do?

384
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:22,170
Am I having fun? Yeah, I'm having fun.

385
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,529
I'm having fun.

386
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:26,260
I have an itchy face.

387
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,300
Can somebody explain to me what that is, by the way?

388
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:39,640
Like for some reason, randomly, just pieces of my face will be itchy.

389
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,520
It'll be like scratchy. Oh, like, hmm, hmm, hmm.

390
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:48,529
What does that mean?

391
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:51,170
Why do it? And I'll be normal for a whole day.

392
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,609
And then it was my face will just start itching in random places.

393
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:02,170
Dead skin. You have too much skin there.

394
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,130
Somebody just say, I don't know, dude, take your shirt off.

395
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:18,289
Well, that's not what I asked.

396
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:19,529
I was asking. That's not what I was.

397
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:20,810
What are you talking? Why?

398
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:32,899
And that person for 10 minutes.

399
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:50,130
Did I get a I did. OK, I got to go back.

400
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:59,340
I don't don't only see what I'm talking about.

401
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:02,029
It's like itchy right there.

402
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:11,960
And it wasn't itchy there five minutes ago.

403
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,590
What the fuck? OK, whatever.

404
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:22,619
It's because there are worms in your face.

405
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:26,270
All right. I've done two out of two.

406
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:31,649
Let's see if I can do three three.

407
01:25:31,649 --> 01:25:33,010
And they get hit by those beams, too.

408
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,289
No, sorry. You can't hit a ghost with a glass bottle.

409
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:37,850
So they can't get hurt by that.

410
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:56,909
I understand. I remember the logic from earlier.

411
01:25:56,909 --> 01:25:57,590
Could have gone the other way.

412
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,909
That's a classic rookie pack in the state.

413
01:25:59,909 --> 01:26:03,500
I should have gone the other way.

414
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:32,100
Actually, a rookie mistake.

415
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,220
What the why is that even here?

416
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:39,659
Come on. I was fine. I had it right there.

417
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,140
That was dumb.

418
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,300
It's stage hazards on a Pacman game.

419
01:26:47,170 --> 01:27:02,510
This game has ass cheeks.

420
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:10,689
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

421
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:18,579
I thought it looked really weird doing that.

422
01:27:18,579 --> 01:27:20,340
How weird did that look?

423
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:28,340
That's why I never have the camera on.

424
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:45,300
Very. OK, good. Holy shit.

425
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:59,350
Whoa, I'm too big to fit through here.

426
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:13,750
No. Oh, why does it feel like such a failure?

427
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:32,699
What are you doing?

428
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:34,619
When are you going to play Splatoon 3?

429
01:28:34,619 --> 01:28:40,850
After I play Splatoon 1 and 2, which I have not done yet.

430
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:43,090
I don't like Splatoon. I told you already.

431
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,810
Because it reminds me of that old Tony Hawk multiplayer game mode.

432
01:28:46,810 --> 01:29:04,800
And I would just get infuriated at it.

433
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,250
I think I got one of these, right?

434
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:16,739
In their door back there, I can do.

435
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,199
You're a monster.

436
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:24,420
No, I saw the Tony Hawk Pro Skater had this mode

437
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:32,579
where I think it was called tagging or graffiti mode or something.

438
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:37,939
And I would always get so screwed because a buddy of mine would get a one million point streak

439
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:42,359
because how it worked is everything you touched in a combo,

440
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:47,399
you have whatever you touch during the combo would turn into your team's color.

441
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,359
And I would just be playing and getting areas.

442
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:51,840
And, oh, yeah, I got the railing.

443
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,680
I got this ramp.

444
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,640
And then somebody that was really good at the game would just fly through,

445
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,949
do a million point thing on it across the whole game.

446
01:29:58,949 --> 01:30:00,590
And then I just had to literally sit around and do nothing

447
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:03,770
because I could never get it back.

448
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,970
I played Splatoon for the first time,

449
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:09,569
and it just brought back those awful memories of, oh, let's go.

450
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:12,489
I'm going for it. I'm doing a good job.

451
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:13,449
I painted so much.

452
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:15,569
And then I turn around, the whole thing is gone.

453
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:26,939
And we just get absolutely dominated.

454
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:34,829
So you're bad. Yeah. Yes.

455
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:40,229
Yes, I'm very bad at that game. Yes.

456
01:30:40,229 --> 01:30:49,550
OK. Is it mad because bad?

457
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:52,869
No, no, I'm not. I'm just bad at that game.

458
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:54,630
That's it. There's no more. There's no argument.

459
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,189
There is no argument.

460
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:58,949
I know people like expect. OK, this is a funny thing.

461
01:30:58,949 --> 01:31:01,710
Like, oh, mad because bad. Oh, you suck at it.

462
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:09,800
That's why. Yeah. But no, you mad.

463
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,369
You got to get mad because you're not good at it.

464
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:13,729
Like, no, yeah, I'm terrible at it.

465
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:18,430
I'm dog shit at it. That's why I don't play it.

466
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:21,520
Oh, shit. All right.

467
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,409
Well, thanks for the scream.

468
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:31,859
How do I get out of here? I'm stuck in here now. What?

469
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:39,029
You need to wash your neck. What's wrong with it?

470
01:31:39,029 --> 01:31:40,590
You know where I do get mad, right?

471
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:42,430
Because, for instance, if you say, dude, oh, why?

472
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,229
You just you don't like it because you suck at it.

473
01:31:44,229 --> 01:31:46,590
You're just shitty at Splatoon. Yeah, Splatoon.

474
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,670
Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely.

475
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,630
Please, please continue to ridicule me because I agree with you.

476
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:53,909
But if I'm playing Elden Ring and I see like mad because bad,

477
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:55,310
it's like, shut the fuck up.

478
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:57,199
How fuck you? How dare you?

479
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,199
I know that I'm playing this game pretty well.

480
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,199
And like, I'm having a lot of trouble on this boss.

481
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:05,810
How dare you? Right. There's a difference.

482
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:19,640
Where's the end? Well, whatever.

483
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,050
If this is a game that you know you like

484
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,649
and you're having trouble with it, as somebody says, wow, dude, skill issue.

485
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:27,170
Like, fuck, I like this game.

486
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:29,170
Don't I want to be good at this game?

487
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:38,060
I didn't even mean to do that.

488
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:41,010
I just literally pressed the button three times and I just got it.

489
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:51,380
All right. I get too much rice.

490
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:57,460
Cherries are kind of worth nothing.

491
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,619
Why is the cherry so hard to get?

492
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:03,489
It's not even that big of a deal.

493
01:33:03,489 --> 01:33:16,510
I thought I saw red.

494
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:24,859
I got it once.

495
01:33:24,859 --> 01:33:28,100
You do a ball pit stream.

496
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:32,220
Oh, I might get lost.

497
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,140
That would be one of those streams.

498
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,819
Be like, guys, I'm here.

499
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:39,020
I've rented out a whole play place and let's go and have cameras everywhere.

500
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,420
It's oh, wow.

501
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,550
I can't believe it. It's just so fun.

502
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,949
And then we just we go to a BRB at one point.

503
01:33:45,949 --> 01:33:47,989
I'm in like the tube hanging out.

504
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:49,189
Wow. He went down the slide.

505
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:51,069
All right. We'll be right back.

506
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:53,390
And you come back from the break and I'm just gone.

507
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:56,720
It's like, where is he? Where the fuck is he?

508
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:08,350
I'm just like in the ball pit.

509
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,430
I'm in the ball pit.

510
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:17,020
There's a line in the lap.

511
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,899
And it would be it would be the first BRB.

512
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:21,979
It would literally be BRB one after 15 minutes.

513
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:37,810
The ball pit is gross.

514
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,380
I I'm not I don't.

515
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,380
Yeah, I don't I would.

516
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,380
Yeah.

517
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:03,920
Ball pit of despair.

518
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,659
Anything over here?

519
01:35:09,659 --> 01:35:10,819
Dude, you've eaten boogers.

520
01:35:10,819 --> 01:35:14,930
You can't say that ball pits are gross.

521
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,829
Would you eat somebody else's boogers?

522
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:20,149
Would you eat someone else's boogers?

523
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:21,149
Yes or no.

524
01:35:21,149 --> 01:35:23,470
The answer is absolutely no.

525
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:27,539
So what are you talking about?

526
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:29,859
If you've eaten boogers in your whole life before.

527
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:32,579
And by the way, can we just back up a little bit?

528
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:35,260
Can we just take a quick little break and understand?

529
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,140
I don't I don't do this shit.

530
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,460
I don't eat boogers.

531
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,539
When what are you describing?

532
01:35:40,539 --> 01:35:43,380
When did I eat boogers on stream?

533
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,979
I'm a grown man.

534
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:47,750
What when did I eat boogers?

535
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,069
I'm not following when this happened.

536
01:35:54,890 --> 01:36:07,260
When when you said you were going to drink stirs loogie.

537
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:11,659
That's no, but that's your hold on.

538
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:17,020
But that was for a very specific joke routine

539
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:19,340
that I was going to commit to.

540
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:22,140
I wasn't sitting there like, oh, oh, boogers.

541
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,140
OK, shut up.

542
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:24,380
Everyone stop talking now.

543
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,359
Are you fucking up my game?

544
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:27,720
Why the fuck did I just do that?

545
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,359
I hate. Oh, my God.

546
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:31,109
What an idiot.

547
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,949
What a fucking idiot.

548
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:35,310
I forget that people just will click that and share it with everybody.

549
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:38,979
Look what he said. He said boogers.

550
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,409
I'm too old for this.

551
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:45,739
I'm too old for this. I am.

552
01:36:45,739 --> 01:36:51,000
I'm way too old for this.

553
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,119
Oh, my God. I'm getting flustered.

554
01:36:53,119 --> 01:37:05,130
I actually am.

555
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:11,289
I like this music.

556
01:37:11,289 --> 01:37:24,460
Wait, what?

557
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,800
Oh, my goodness.

558
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,560
All right. Relax.

559
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:38,119
Can't hit it.

560
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:39,000
OK, they got electrified.

561
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,800
I can't hurt him.

562
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:57,250
This is going to be sick.

563
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:00,420
Oh, my God. And look, look what happened.

564
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:00,939
Look what happened.

565
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:02,859
Look what I look what's going on over in this chat.

566
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:15,609
Everyone's talking about it now.

567
01:38:15,609 --> 01:38:27,329
Oh, Grandpa Pac-Man is here.

568
01:38:27,329 --> 01:38:29,720
I rescue Grandpa.

569
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,800
Pac-Man, there should be a key out here.

570
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:43,920
You need to find it.

571
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,739
Oh, come on.

572
01:38:48,739 --> 01:38:53,229
What? What is this?

573
01:38:53,229 --> 01:38:55,470
I ate the booger. I'm a booger reader.

574
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:58,510
OK, I just have a... This is a booger eating stream.

575
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,310
I'm just eating boogers.

576
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,510
When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.

577
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,930
That's what I do.

578
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:08,899
What is this from?

579
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:10,220
Why did I say that?

580
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,420
What was the point of me saying this?

581
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:12,020
I don't get it.

582
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:17,359
I ate the booger. I'm a booger reader.

583
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,399
OK, I just have a... This is a booger eating stream.

584
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:22,199
I'm just eating boogers.

585
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:25,399
When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.

586
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:27,039
That's what I do.

587
01:39:27,039 --> 01:39:34,289
That's a stream from three years ago.

588
01:39:34,289 --> 01:39:38,439
Oh, my goodness.

589
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:39,680
No, never mind.

590
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,739
I thought my microphone was messed up.

591
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:48,739
It actually might be.

592
01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:50,500
Oh, yeah, it is.

593
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:58,779
Have you been hearing double this whole time?

594
01:39:58,779 --> 01:40:00,750
No? OK.

595
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:01,949
That's from three years ago.

596
01:40:01,949 --> 01:40:03,350
But yeah, it was definitely a joke, though.

597
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:23,250
I was probably just making a stupid joke.

598
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,289
Can you imagine admitting

599
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:28,960
to 700,000 people

600
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,880
concurrent viewers that you eat boogers on stream?

601
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:41,819
I mean, what the fuck?

602
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:46,239
Where's this key?

603
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:47,439
Jesus.

604
01:40:52,779 --> 01:40:56,380
700,000. Yeah, my channel's like really dropped a lot.

605
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,460
You guys weren't here three or four years ago.

606
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:02,260
I was averaging three to five hundred thousand concurrent viewers every day.

607
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:04,060
I mean, the stream kind of fell.

608
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,220
And once I started doing like the booger reading stuff and

609
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,899
like jokes that people thought were like shitty.

610
01:41:07,899 --> 01:41:13,470
I lost a lot of people, I think.

611
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:16,579
I was actually really surprised that I thought, you know,

612
01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:18,899
they're doing a routine where I like eat a bunch of boogers on stream

613
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:20,619
was like, oh, maybe it was funny for a minute.

614
01:41:20,619 --> 01:41:23,619
But I lost like three or four hundred thousand people concurrently.

615
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:28,859
So like I try to see like if the joke will land first before I do it.

616
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:38,609
That's kind of frustrating, but whatever.

617
01:41:38,609 --> 01:41:40,449
That was my favorite stream.

618
01:41:40,449 --> 01:41:43,170
Yeah, I mean, like some people thought it was funny.

619
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:57,430
But let's rescue Grandpa.

620
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:08,310
Thanks, Pac-Man. I'll wait for you up ahead.

621
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:14,579
I know the Apple. Oh, now I do.

622
01:42:14,579 --> 01:42:22,020
I got to make sure I don't die.

623
01:42:26,539 --> 01:42:27,819
That scared the shit out of me.

624
01:42:27,819 --> 01:42:42,220
I didn't think it was going to go that far.

625
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:46,430
Oh, Jesus.

626
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:48,670
I'm not reading that one. It was fucked up.

627
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:31,939
Oh, secret.

628
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:34,449
I don't. I got to bounce from here.

629
01:43:34,449 --> 01:43:44,060
This is going to this is kind of hard.

630
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,779
How do I get that?

631
01:43:46,779 --> 01:43:47,739
Not like that.

632
01:43:47,739 --> 01:43:51,810
Oh, my God. I haven't gone all the way back, aren't I?

633
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:53,529
Thank goodness. Thank God.

634
01:43:54,529 --> 01:44:10,399
Where am I? All right, I got it.

635
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:29,199
All right, let's get it.

636
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,479
There's the A.

637
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:40,920
Oh, oh, read it.

638
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:45,550
Read what? I mean, read, read what?

639
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:47,869
What am I? What is a read?

640
01:44:47,869 --> 01:44:56,649
How long is? Oh, that looks like I can get it, doesn't it?

641
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:27,319
And oh, hey, I got it.

642
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:35,420
Pac-Man is going to be a big one.

643
01:45:36,220 --> 01:46:04,350
Whoa. Got them all.

644
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:09,569
I died. Whoa. Big one, dude.

645
01:46:09,569 --> 01:46:11,970
Yeah, I know. I was pretty hogged up that one.

646
01:46:18,609 --> 01:46:38,840
We're good. Oh, whoa.

647
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:50,029
Oh, my God. I'm fine.

648
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:59,579
Oh, my goodness. How do I get back up?

649
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:02,090
Dude, get up.

650
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:04,210
What the fuck is this here for if I can't do it?

651
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,369
Do you look like you know French?

652
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:39,289
I don't. I don't know any other languages.

653
01:47:39,289 --> 01:47:41,369
I can't learn another language.

654
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:43,210
I know everybody says that.

655
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:45,409
Like, oh, no, you know, there's this program you can learn.

656
01:47:45,409 --> 01:48:02,939
It's really easy. No, not for me.

657
01:48:02,979 --> 01:48:13,319
Yeah, I, I definitely could not.

658
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:19,970
I would need a reason.

659
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:25,479
Um, I mean, you can learn a language to, you know, have to have a reason

660
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:29,449
to learn French or Spanish or you can just do it just because

661
01:48:39,739 --> 01:48:41,899
I speak three languages and I'm not even 18.

662
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,500
I mean, that's that's a huge skill to have.

663
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:51,119
It really is. Think about think about this.

664
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:57,949
It's oh, I can only truly communicate

665
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:02,390
with a very limited amount of people.

666
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:05,619
I only know English.

667
01:49:05,619 --> 01:49:10,220
My communication ability is much lower than yours.

668
01:49:13,029 --> 01:49:24,739
It's weird to think about that.

669
01:49:24,739 --> 01:49:27,560
Ever heard of Google Translate?

670
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:31,039
Yeah, there's a huge difference between Google Translate

671
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:36,239
and truly being able to be at a restaurant and talk to the person

672
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,359
or be able to communicate with somebody online and just be able to speak

673
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:41,520
fluently and just completely understand.

674
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,600
I'm not talking about like opening up a little book and being like, OK,

675
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,640
where do some how do I go to the bathroom?

676
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,319
No, I'm talking about you truly fluently understand the language,

677
01:49:50,359 --> 01:50:01,539
like in and out completely.

678
01:50:01,539 --> 01:50:05,300
Because even if you use a translator, you are not truly understanding

679
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,819
what you are saying.

680
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:09,340
You are just phonetically repeating something because you know

681
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:11,939
that's what it's supposed to sound like.

682
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,859
You're not truly comprehending what you're saying.

683
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:18,609
You're looking at a thing that's telling you what to say.

684
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,100
You don't know exactly why or how,

685
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:35,520
unless you actually learn the language fluently.

686
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:44,760
See, that's pretty.

687
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,119
There's no way to even gauge where your heart are you jumping.

688
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:52,699
It sounds like a teacher.

689
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:55,060
Hold on. Sorry, let me correct that.

690
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:56,539
Oh, boogers, right?

691
01:50:56,539 --> 01:50:58,899
Is that is that what you want?

692
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:02,560
OK, is that what you're looking for?

693
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,489
Let me rephrase that.

694
01:51:05,489 --> 01:51:06,689
What I meant to say was,

695
01:51:06,689 --> 01:51:08,970
oh, probably probably move, Franché.

696
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,479
Let me make it so you guys can understand.

697
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:31,340
What's wrong with you? You get it.

698
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:33,779
You understand why I just did that.

699
01:51:33,819 --> 01:51:36,619
If you don't know why I just did that, come on, Gwyn.

700
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:45,960
You know what I mean? Come on.

701
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,319
Wrong. I'm pressing A to hover.

702
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:52,409
No, I don't want to play in easy mode.

703
01:51:52,409 --> 01:51:55,529
I'm holding A to hover because every other video game I've ever played

704
01:51:55,529 --> 01:51:57,649
was hold the jump button to hover.

705
01:51:57,649 --> 01:52:01,369
Every time you've seen me skyrocket to the goddamn ground.

706
01:52:21,859 --> 01:52:25,430
God!

707
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:29,630
X, X, hold X, hold X, hold the X button.

708
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:33,069
Hold X to do this.

709
01:52:33,069 --> 01:52:40,100
X, hold X, no depth perception.

710
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:43,460
No, it's called remembering muscle memory

711
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:48,979
for every single platforming

712
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:54,859
video game with a jump that's ever been recorded in human history

713
01:52:54,859 --> 01:53:02,130
since when the cavemen were making video games from.

714
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:14,390
All right, settle down.

715
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:16,069
This game's not that fucking hard, man.

716
01:53:16,069 --> 01:53:44,369
I got it. Relax. I'm going to be fine.

717
01:53:44,369 --> 01:53:57,550
See, I figured it out.

718
01:53:57,550 --> 01:54:15,500
Where's your face? I'm here.

719
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:29,180
Oh, yep. No, no, no.

720
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:42,109
I want to explore.

721
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:50,539
Yeah, the grenade works on those guys.

722
01:54:50,539 --> 01:54:57,539
Pac-Man, please. Enough of that.

723
01:54:57,539 --> 01:55:00,640
Yes. Game is this.

724
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,680
This is called Pac-Man World repack.

725
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,640
It's on Steam and maybe somewhere else.

726
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:22,170
I got it on Steam.

727
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:24,170
Yeah, it's a remake from an old PlayStation.

728
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:12,109
I got everything right. Yep.

729
01:56:12,109 --> 01:56:23,180
Hogman. Yeah.

730
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,380
All right. I'm not going to screw this up.

731
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,340
I got plenty of time to do this.

732
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:29,920
Let's go. Go do it right.

733
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:32,520
I don't need to jump.

734
01:56:32,520 --> 01:57:03,619
It's good. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

735
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:17,319
I got everything. Yeah, I'm good.

736
01:57:17,319 --> 01:57:20,560
Remember, your hair looks like it would fit really nicely on a groomed dog.

737
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:27,649
If I saw this kind of hair on a dog, I'd be very confused.

738
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,850
That would be very confusing.

739
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:42,829
Like, why does that dog have human hair?

740
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:46,109
It's like a one, one, two, three.

741
01:57:46,149 --> 01:58:00,390
Oh, damn it. I'm going to sit further back.

742
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:10,529
They're all blending together.

743
01:58:10,529 --> 01:58:49,659
Why are they all blending together?

744
01:58:49,659 --> 01:58:57,659
Oh my God, there's so many strawberries on this one.

745
01:58:57,659 --> 01:59:00,779
I thought it was one, two, three in a row, like one then whatever.

746
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:35,920
Oh, you suck. Hey.

747
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:37,720
All right. Where's the boss?

748
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:44,920
Get hype. Why do you look so mad all the time?

749
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:53,539
That's just my face, dude. This is awesome.

750
01:59:53,899 --> 02:00:06,989
Pac-Man is a power pellet.

751
02:00:06,989 --> 02:00:09,430
When you grab one, cannons are powered up for a short time.

752
02:00:15,609 --> 02:00:16,569
That's a bomb dot.

753
02:00:16,569 --> 02:00:19,090
You can take out all nearby enemies and obstacles.

754
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:45,989
I missed it. Sorry.

755
02:00:45,989 --> 02:01:28,550
Excuse me. How did I not get that?

756
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:36,840
Oh, my God.

757
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:40,039
Oh, that's got way harder for no reason.

758
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:44,819
I was talking to this.

759
02:02:44,819 --> 02:02:46,420
Who's my favorite character? Grandpa.

760
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:54,380
Pac-Man, for sure.

761
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:57,460
King Calaxian. That's a G.

762
02:03:07,239 --> 02:03:11,340
What am I supposed to do about this?

763
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:41,329
He dodged that.

764
02:03:41,329 --> 02:03:43,850
Oh, good placement.

765
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:12,699
Oh, I had I had checkers or Raleigh's.

766
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:14,819
I want to give you a review on it.

767
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:15,460
I forgot about that.

768
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:17,460
I want to give you a review about how I feel about Raleigh's.

769
02:04:18,979 --> 02:04:20,949
Remember how I never had it before?

770
02:04:20,949 --> 02:04:23,229
I had it. I had Raleigh's.

771
02:04:23,829 --> 02:04:29,399
Let me tell you something very important.

772
02:04:29,399 --> 02:04:35,539
Is it Raleigh's Raleigh's checkers, Raleigh's, Raleigh's, Raleigh's?

773
02:04:35,579 --> 02:04:41,069
How I don't know how you say it.

774
02:04:41,069 --> 02:04:46,359
I'll tell you after. OK, but yeah, I had it

775
02:04:46,359 --> 02:04:48,760
during my tier list, my fast food tier list stream.

776
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,840
People were like, you've never had checkers before.

777
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,159
You've never had rallies before.

778
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:53,000
How is that possible?

779
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,359
And I was like, I never had it.

780
02:04:54,359 --> 02:04:56,840
And I said, if I ever have it, I'll update you.

781
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:59,319
And I had it. So I thought, well, should I need to update you guys?

782
02:05:01,829 --> 02:05:03,989
And I have a couple of very strong opinions on it.

783
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:06,789
I think I'm going to think I'm going to confuse a lot of you.

784
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:20,180
We don't care.

785
02:05:20,699 --> 02:05:22,420
We don't care.

786
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:28,619
But whatever. I mean, I just want to let you know, dude, we don't care.

787
02:05:29,079 --> 02:05:30,720
No, I don't care. Really?

788
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:32,840
OK, run a poll in the chat right now.

789
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,640
And I don't think don't.

790
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,479
Oh, whatever.

791
02:05:35,479 --> 02:05:38,960
I like the streamers going off on like a story or a tangent.

792
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:39,840
I want to hear it. No, no, no.

793
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,720
They truly tell me the truth.

794
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:43,159
Yes or no.

795
02:05:43,159 --> 02:05:45,079
Do you give a shit about that?

796
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:48,520
I've eaten at rallies and be very honest, like the take away

797
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,920
the fact that like, oh, you're here and hanging out.

798
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:54,399
Do you actually give a shit about what I'm about to say at all?

799
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:56,880
And I mean, truly be like, no, I really don't give a fuck.

800
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:02,079
I want to know if at least 40%

801
02:06:02,079 --> 02:06:04,500
of you do not give a shit about this.

802
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,380
I won't talk about it.

803
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:07,399
And I'm very curious.

804
02:06:07,399 --> 02:06:11,939
It's R-A-L-L-Y.

805
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:14,300
I want to see just how many people don't care.

806
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:28,750
That's so funny to me.

807
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:31,270
God damn it.

808
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:32,680
Yeah. Yeah.

809
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:36,109
R-A-L-L-Y-S.

810
02:06:36,109 --> 02:06:45,390
I have no patience at all.

811
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:46,829
All right. What does it say?

812
02:06:46,829 --> 02:06:50,810
How you guys feel?

813
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,890
Whoa. OK, it's a lot so far.

814
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:55,510
That's a very that's a big initial one.

815
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:11,670
Where 39% say no, I don't care.

816
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:19,390
OK, stop.

817
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:23,229
OK, it's this one right after.

818
02:07:23,229 --> 02:07:23,949
God damn it.

819
02:07:23,949 --> 02:07:36,159
They're the same shape.

820
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:37,560
All right. We're at 37%.

821
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:38,720
That means enough of you care.

822
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:50,399
So I'm going to do it.

823
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:51,479
Thirty six percent. Yeah.

824
02:07:51,479 --> 02:07:57,500
I told you have to get over 40%.

825
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:58,500
So where's the next area?

826
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:04,500
Did I do it all?

827
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,359
Is there a next area?

828
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:10,819
How do I get there?

829
02:08:10,819 --> 02:08:11,779
All right. That's it.

830
02:08:11,779 --> 02:08:16,970
I'm going to talk about it.

831
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:18,729
OK. All right.

832
02:08:18,729 --> 02:08:22,420
You've spoken.

833
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:26,779
The Rally's French fries

834
02:08:26,779 --> 02:08:29,979
are the best fast food French fries I've ever had

835
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:34,420
in my entire life, in my entire life.

836
02:08:34,979 --> 02:08:38,500
They are the most un fucking believable French fries.

837
02:08:38,979 --> 02:08:41,350
They are unbelievably good.

838
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:43,909
It is so mind boggling how they could be that good.

839
02:08:43,909 --> 02:08:46,029
They're that good. They're unbelievable.

840
02:08:46,029 --> 02:08:47,310
Everything else is dog shit.

841
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:58,960
The whole fucking rest of the whole restaurant.

842
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,800
All right. The chicken strips were OK.

843
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,899
They were fine.

844
02:09:02,899 --> 02:09:05,380
But everything else, I was like, this is kind of not good.

845
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:09,619
But I'm telling you right now, I would go to Rally's

846
02:09:09,939 --> 02:09:13,220
and just get French fries and get a bunch of sauces and shit.

847
02:09:18,579 --> 02:09:20,899
It's worth going to Rally's just to get the French fries

848
02:09:20,899 --> 02:09:23,619
and just get about just get a three large French fry orders

849
02:09:23,619 --> 02:09:32,109
and split it with like two people, three people.

850
02:09:32,109 --> 02:09:34,439
How bad were the other food items?

851
02:09:34,439 --> 02:09:36,600
They were they were just OK.

852
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:40,039
It was like, OK, dog shit was probably rude.

853
02:09:40,819 --> 02:09:45,949
But the chicken fingers were just they didn't really taste like it.

854
02:09:45,949 --> 02:09:49,350
It was just they were very like five or six at five out of ten.

855
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:55,960
They were literally dog shit, although they were five out of ten.

856
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,699
You got chicken at a burger joint.

857
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:04,779
I got a burger, too, and it was OK.

858
02:10:04,779 --> 02:10:07,029
It was like fine.

859
02:10:07,029 --> 02:10:09,630
Every other burger I've had from any other fast food place was better.

860
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:12,729
It was fine.

861
02:10:12,729 --> 02:10:15,850
But let me tell you, the French fries are so good

862
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:21,220
that I want them so bad, so badly right now.

863
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:28,260
They are so crunchy and crispy and they're just perfect.

864
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:30,460
They're always perfectly hot.

865
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:33,060
It tastes like they came right out of an oven and they're like,

866
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:36,180
they're so unbelievably good.

867
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:42,739
I could not tell you how good they are.

868
02:10:42,739 --> 02:10:45,140
You can buy them at the store.

869
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,300
That would be amazing.

870
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:49,579
They sell frozen frozen version.

871
02:10:49,579 --> 02:10:53,170
I don't know what they're doing to those fries, but OK,

872
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:55,130
everything else is like a four or five out of ten.

873
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:58,609
But the fries being that good makes that like a C or a B tier place

874
02:10:58,609 --> 02:10:59,810
that I would go to.

875
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:02,970
If I were to put rallies on that tier list, it'd be probably low B

876
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:07,819
only because I would order French fries and maybe like something else.

877
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:10,970
But just get mainly French fries.

878
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:13,409
It's literally a B for sure because of that.

879
02:11:14,689 --> 02:11:16,060
You have to have them.

880
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:18,260
If you're like, dude, what the fuck is this fast food French fries?

881
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:21,739
Just eat them once and you'll be like, well, my life is forever different.

882
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:26,380
I don't know. Where's the next area?

883
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:35,239
Did I not complete enough stuff?

884
02:11:35,239 --> 02:11:43,649
Was this dude?

885
02:11:43,649 --> 02:11:45,890
I regret it. I should have said I don't care.

886
02:11:52,109 --> 02:12:05,109
Oh, here we go. Two, one.

887
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:12,899
Oh, that looks cool.

888
02:12:12,899 --> 02:12:19,420
I love McDonald's fries, but they can just they can be very bad.

889
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:26,399
I have had McDonald's Burger King Wendy's fries before that were just just sad.

890
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:28,920
And you just don't really want them.

891
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:46,869
It's just not something. It's just not good.

892
02:12:46,869 --> 02:12:51,609
Hang it up there. Fries are inconsistent.

893
02:12:51,609 --> 02:12:55,890
Yeah. I was actually going to make a tweet about it.

894
02:12:57,939 --> 02:13:00,899
I was going to do a tweet where I took a bite out of one of the French fries

895
02:13:00,899 --> 02:13:03,220
and was just going to be like, look, like, guys, listen to this crunch.

896
02:13:03,699 --> 02:13:06,560
And that was going to be the whole video.

897
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:09,039
And it was going to be like, oh, like, Raleigh.

898
02:13:09,039 --> 02:13:11,579
This is listen to this.

899
02:13:11,579 --> 02:13:13,100
And I was like, that's a fucking weird video.

900
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:27,060
So I just didn't make it.

901
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:30,270
McDonald's double cheeseburgers.

902
02:13:30,270 --> 02:13:35,100
Yeah, it's just I know a lot of people say, dude, McDonald's so bad.

903
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:39,420
Why do you have the pallet of a five year old?

904
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:40,340
Something about it.

905
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:43,180
Those did somebody just said the double cheeseburger from McDonald's

906
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:46,850
is unmatched from any place I've had.

907
02:13:46,850 --> 02:13:47,890
It just is.

908
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:50,210
And it's not that it's the best.

909
02:13:50,210 --> 02:13:52,729
Oh, it's the best quality hamburger I've ever had.

910
02:13:52,729 --> 02:13:55,090
It's just it just tastes good.

911
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:59,270
It's just good every time I've ever had a child pallet.

912
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:03,939
Well, I didn't tell you about the salmon that I like.

913
02:14:03,939 --> 02:14:07,210
Kids don't like salmon.

914
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:10,329
I can't name you a five year old that's like, oh, yeah, fresh salmon.

915
02:14:10,649 --> 02:14:27,779
Can I have some? Sorry.

916
02:14:27,779 --> 02:14:40,550
Oh, I can't hurt the big ghosts. Whatever.

917
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:43,220
Kids will eat anything.

918
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:47,100
I don't know how many young how many kids have you ever talked to?

919
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:53,090
Kids do not eat anything.

920
02:14:53,090 --> 02:15:00,590
Huh? When I was a kid, I didn't just eat anything.

921
02:15:00,590 --> 02:15:03,909
I had Captain Crunch for dinner half the time because I told you that story,

922
02:15:03,909 --> 02:15:06,590
how I would be like, I want Captain Crunch for dinner.

923
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:10,960
And my mother would be like, oh, OK, yeah, you can have Captain Crunch for dinner.

924
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,079
But you've got it.

925
02:15:13,079 --> 02:15:15,760
You can have it, but you have to eat dinner first.

926
02:15:17,149 --> 02:15:20,630
So I would be like, oh, my God.

927
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:22,869
I can't believe it. I get to eat Captain Crunch whenever I want.

928
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:25,949
So my mother would I would eat all my dinner and be like,

929
02:15:25,949 --> 02:15:28,350
I can't wait to eat Captain Crunch for dinner.

930
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:35,500
And she would give me this little like it had to have been ten pellets.

931
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:42,560
It had to have been ten pellets total what I would get after dinner.

932
02:15:43,479 --> 02:15:46,630
And I thought I was a scammer.

933
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:48,550
I was like, yeah, mm hmm.

934
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:52,149
So I just have to eat my dinner and I can eat Captain Crunch for dinner.

935
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:55,829
Oh, I'm the most intelligent kid in the world.

936
02:15:57,819 --> 02:16:00,500
And she was giving me the equivalent of like two spoonfuls of shit.

937
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:08,930
And I thought I was the smart one.

938
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:24,989
Oh, I need whiz metal.

939
02:16:24,989 --> 02:16:29,180
Oh, that's just dessert.

940
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:34,799
Yeah. But in my five year old of six, whatever, your old brain, whatever it was,

941
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:42,479
it's the same story with the if what the hell?

942
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:48,120
OK, we're good.

943
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:52,299
Missing the A, but whatever.

944
02:16:59,010 --> 02:17:02,409
It's the same story with the if his arm stays up, he's asleep.

945
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:08,700
I've told that many times, but there's probably a lot of new people on the channel.

946
02:17:08,819 --> 02:17:10,700
Maybe should I tell it again?

947
02:17:16,299 --> 02:17:19,579
OK, so when I would be and my siblings were younger again,

948
02:17:19,579 --> 02:17:22,299
we thought we were the smartest people in the room.

949
02:17:22,299 --> 02:17:26,899
Uh, you know, when when when you're when you're a kid and you're supposed to be

950
02:17:26,899 --> 02:17:29,379
asleep in bed, you're supposed to be asleep, it's bedtime.

951
02:17:29,379 --> 02:17:33,379
And no, I'm staying up and I'm going to talk and and do stuff.

952
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:37,219
And then, you know, you hear the here comes

953
02:17:37,819 --> 02:17:39,860
becomes mom or dad to see like what's going on in here.

954
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:43,840
And, you know, you don't want to get in trouble, you know.

955
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,000
No, no, I'm asleep. I'm asleep.

956
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,159
So it's like you put your head down and I'm asleep.

957
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:50,319
I'm definitely sleeping. I was not talking.

958
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:53,360
We were not messing around having fun in here, right?

959
02:17:53,559 --> 02:17:56,680
I was not having any fun in here.

960
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,440
And then they would come over.

961
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:01,319
And my mother and my father would say, oh, really interesting.

962
02:18:01,319 --> 02:18:03,440
OK, they look asleep.

963
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:04,879
Yeah, I think they're asleep.

964
02:18:04,879 --> 02:18:07,719
It's really one foolproof way to know if somebody's truly sleeping.

965
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:12,920
And they would come and take your arm and they would just lift it up and hold it.

966
02:18:13,239 --> 02:18:16,399
And they would say, well, I mean, if his arm stays up, he's asleep.

967
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:22,860
And I would be sitting there going like this and in my brain going, yep.

968
02:18:23,299 --> 02:18:25,180
Gotcha, motherfucker. Mm hmm.

969
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:27,959
That's me asleep.

970
02:18:27,959 --> 02:18:31,010
And then they'd go, oh, oh, OK.

971
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:32,930
Very asleep. Oh, really asleep.

972
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:34,290
Asleep. OK, that's OK.

973
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:37,489
So it wasn't having any fun in here.

974
02:18:37,489 --> 02:18:39,290
And I thought I was so smart.

975
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:41,729
And then eventually, eventually I caught on.

976
02:18:42,209 --> 02:18:45,489
And I did this soccer flop.

977
02:18:46,209 --> 02:18:48,569
Right. So instead of going like this and holding it up,

978
02:18:48,569 --> 02:18:50,370
oh, his arm stays up, he's asleep. OK.

979
02:18:51,569 --> 02:18:54,950
It turned into this.

980
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:57,030
Like, no way, I'm not falling for that one.

981
02:18:57,549 --> 02:19:00,149
So exaggerated that I just flop it.

982
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:05,139
And the same thing would happen.

983
02:19:05,139 --> 02:19:08,520
You were a stupid fucking kid.

984
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:12,219
Aren't we all, though?

985
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:23,440
He did this when he was 22.

986
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:31,649
I was a real smart kid.

987
02:19:31,649 --> 02:19:34,250
I was smart. No, you think you were smart.

988
02:19:37,059 --> 02:19:39,819
You were shoving crayons up your nose like everybody else was.

989
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,500
Come on.

990
02:19:52,649 --> 02:20:13,030
I don't have banana. Oh, shit, it's right there.

991
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:14,229
Get up there.

992
02:20:14,229 --> 02:20:24,739
Did I lose my opportunity to do this?

993
02:20:24,739 --> 02:20:32,500
Oh, shit. Were you a glue eater?

994
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:40,510
No, I actually wasn't.

995
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:50,020
What was the tooth for?

996
02:20:50,020 --> 02:21:01,729
I don't know. No, this is so annoying.

997
02:21:01,729 --> 02:21:07,549
I actually can't get that.

998
02:21:07,549 --> 02:21:26,729
Oh, yes, I can. I'm just stupid.

999
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:36,299
I was just do. Oh.

1000
02:21:36,299 --> 02:21:38,180
All he gives Derma 10 pellets of Captain

1001
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:40,260
Crunch after he finishes all this hamburger helper.

1002
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:44,079
This stuff is so good.

1003
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:46,440
Oh, man, you just made me think of a hamburger helper.

1004
02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:49,459
What a bunch of junk.

1005
02:21:49,459 --> 02:21:51,340
What a bunch of fucking junk.

1006
02:21:51,340 --> 02:22:03,840
But it is the best shit in the world.

1007
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:05,319
It's gross. No, it's not.

1008
02:22:05,319 --> 02:22:08,069
Don't stop.

1009
02:22:08,069 --> 02:22:10,590
Look, something can be weirdly unappetizing,

1010
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:12,389
but still be one of the best things you've ever eaten.

1011
02:22:12,389 --> 02:22:16,309
It's got to stop. Come on.

1012
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:18,750
I I know it's it's gross.

1013
02:22:19,069 --> 02:22:21,709
OK, maybe it is a little gross, but not but it's still delicious.

1014
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,159
It's just so yummy.

1015
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:44,459
Food snobs.

1016
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:46,299
Um, I mean, I get it.

1017
02:22:46,299 --> 02:22:49,579
I get it. It's kind of filthy looking.

1018
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,520
It kind of looks like somebody puked into a pan.

1019
02:22:56,940 --> 02:23:00,500
There is that period where you are making hamburger helper,

1020
02:23:00,899 --> 02:23:04,700
and it's at that gross phase where it's not really combined all the way.

1021
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,819
And it just looks like somebody threw up into your saucepan.

1022
02:23:07,739 --> 02:23:11,340
And you're sitting there thinking, oh, help, this thickens up.

1023
02:23:12,059 --> 02:23:14,059
This is fucking awful.

1024
02:23:14,059 --> 02:23:15,780
It happens every time.

1025
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:18,500
Every single time I've ever made hamburger helper, I've said the same thing.

1026
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:22,059
I do like the Sims shit.

1027
02:23:22,059 --> 02:23:24,700
I'm sitting there cooking and I go.

1028
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:26,700
Oh, yuck.

1029
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:33,229
And then when it's done, I eat it.

1030
02:23:33,229 --> 02:23:34,670
And it's actually very good.

1031
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:54,309
I'm very happy, though.

1032
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:56,950
Get them all, get them all, get them all, get them all.

1033
02:23:56,950 --> 02:24:03,500
Yay. Perfect slop food.

1034
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:07,299
That's the best way to describe it.

1035
02:24:07,299 --> 02:24:10,819
It's so weird because it doesn't hamburger helper have as many flavors

1036
02:24:10,819 --> 02:24:12,540
as Gatorade does.

1037
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:14,540
There's like 15 different boxes, isn't there?

1038
02:24:18,579 --> 02:24:29,319
There's so many different kinds. Variety.

1039
02:24:29,319 --> 02:24:35,260
Yeah. You know what else is really good about hamburger helper?

1040
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:37,579
It it'll feed you for a long time.

1041
02:24:40,489 --> 02:24:41,649
It's filling.

1042
02:24:41,649 --> 02:24:43,370
It'll keep you full for a while.

1043
02:24:43,370 --> 02:24:45,809
And you can put that in the fridge and keep it there and just heat it up.

1044
02:24:58,350 --> 02:25:00,309
Imagine it with chicken and not hamburger.

1045
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:05,989
There is absolutely probably a bunch of TikTok videos

1046
02:25:06,549 --> 02:25:12,149
of hamburger helper hacks that are all all what you are describing.

1047
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:25,530
I don't think you have to look very far.

1048
02:25:25,530 --> 02:25:31,299
Is there chicken helper?

1049
02:25:31,299 --> 02:25:33,379
See, that to me would be kind of strange.

1050
02:25:33,379 --> 02:25:34,540
Chicken's a little different.

1051
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:38,260
How would you what do you chicken helper?

1052
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:41,700
I don't get it because the whole thing with hamburger helper is it's ground beef.

1053
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:45,620
So you just brown it in the pan and then, you know, drain it.

1054
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:49,309
How do you you just dump it in with a bunch of chicken

1055
02:25:49,309 --> 02:25:51,829
patty strips or something about a ground is a ground chicken,

1056
02:25:53,579 --> 02:25:59,229
shredded chicken, this tuna helper.

1057
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:04,270
I could go for a big fucking egg salad right now.

1058
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:09,500
I make a great egg salad.

1059
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,219
I make probably the I'm not.

1060
02:26:11,219 --> 02:26:13,420
I'm trying to be very clear here.

1061
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:15,579
I make the best egg salad you've ever had in your life.

1062
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:22,780
I mean it. If I sold my egg salad, it would I'd be a fucking trillionaire.

1063
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:27,079
I would it would be it would be a story like, oh, yeah, I now own

1064
02:26:27,079 --> 02:26:30,319
and operate like 50 restaurants where we we all we have is that we have a bunch

1065
02:26:30,319 --> 02:26:35,020
of egg salad. That's like what we do.

1066
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:38,340
Imagine the main menu item on your restaurant is an egg salad.

1067
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:42,719
You guys have prime rib?

1068
02:26:42,719 --> 02:26:44,120
No, not at all.

1069
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:48,680
Oh, do you have any like seared chicken or any, you know, tuna or no, nothing.

1070
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:50,799
We have we have egg salad sandwiches. That's it.

1071
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:55,979
But they would do what you're good at.

1072
02:26:55,979 --> 02:26:58,579
I'm telling you, I make my egg salad and you're going to fucking freak out.

1073
02:26:59,379 --> 02:27:00,540
Why am I acting so weird?

1074
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:07,110
I don't know. Literally show me how you make it.

1075
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:09,229
It's this it's a secret.

1076
02:27:09,229 --> 02:27:21,299
It's an actual secret recipe.

1077
02:27:21,299 --> 02:27:32,059
The secret recipe.

1078
02:27:32,059 --> 02:27:35,540
The secret is it's something else you add to it.

1079
02:27:36,139 --> 02:27:37,219
It's a secret recipe.

1080
02:27:37,219 --> 02:27:38,540
I'm not going to give it to you.

1081
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:40,620
I have to be able to pass something down to my kids.

1082
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,899
That's not watch me eat boogers on stream.

1083
02:27:44,129 --> 02:27:46,850
You know what I mean? Like there has to be something else.

1084
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:48,930
Oh, yeah. What did Grandpa pass down?

1085
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:50,649
Oh, he was a fucking weirdo online.

1086
02:27:50,649 --> 02:27:51,770
That's pretty much it.

1087
02:27:51,770 --> 02:27:53,850
No, he left behind his secret.

1088
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:55,290
Grandpa left his.

1089
02:27:55,290 --> 02:27:55,850
I'm going to write it.

1090
02:27:55,850 --> 02:27:59,889
I'm going to write it down on lined paper and leave it out

1091
02:28:00,010 --> 02:28:02,329
and make sure it's old and fucking shitty looking in 50 years.

1092
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:05,260
Make sure it's all stained and stuff so they can get it.

1093
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,340
But what would they wait on this?

1094
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:09,739
Grandpa's secret egg salad recipe so I can leave something.

1095
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:25,940
Why am I back here?

1096
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,940
To one was to two.

1097
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:35,020
Here we go. It's not a secret.

1098
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:36,540
It's paprika.

1099
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:39,139
I don't it's I don't put paprika in my egg salad.

1100
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:52,909
And what an amateur move that would be, by the way.

1101
02:28:52,909 --> 02:28:54,590
He puts hot sauce in it.

1102
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:57,739
Oh, OK.

1103
02:28:57,739 --> 02:28:58,940
Oh, he puts hot sauce in it.

1104
02:28:58,940 --> 02:28:59,860
Yeah, that's what that's what it is.

1105
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:01,659
That's the secret recipe.

1106
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:10,579
Damn, that looks like it hurt.

1107
02:29:10,579 --> 02:29:13,540
No, I'm not going to tell you because I need to leave a note for my grandkids.

1108
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:19,500
This is all I'm going to have. This is it.

1109
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:22,620
If I say it right now, then it's then it's over

1110
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:26,020
and I can't write it down on a piece of line paper and like burn it.

1111
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:29,420
All right. I'm going to take a lighter and light it on fire.

1112
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:31,340
Burn it. Put it out. Put it out. Light it on fire.

1113
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:32,700
First, put it out.

1114
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:35,059
So it's this old document that they have to find.

1115
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,440
Throw it in a fireplace.

1116
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:51,600
Yeah, like put it in a fireplace and then like get it up, blow it up, blow it out

1117
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:57,809
and make sure it makes sure it's all old and fucked up and right on it.

1118
02:29:58,809 --> 02:30:02,409
Grandpa's award winning egg salad secret.

1119
02:30:06,659 --> 02:30:09,700
And hey, bro, roll up a few hundreds.

1120
02:30:10,139 --> 02:30:10,620
You know what I mean?

1121
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:13,819
Roll up like 10 hundreds and like roll it up together.

1122
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,340
So it's like, holy shit, we found this.

1123
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,340
We found this shit.

1124
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,420
Grandpa rolled up 10 hundreds.

1125
02:30:22,909 --> 02:30:24,110
You thought you would just get an egg salad?

1126
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:27,229
No, you're getting like five grand in cash, too, at least.

1127
02:30:40,239 --> 02:30:41,479
What if they watch this VOD?

1128
02:30:41,479 --> 02:30:43,680
Well, I'm not going to say the recipe. That's the point.

1129
02:30:46,379 --> 02:30:49,059
Oh, I think I screwed it up.

1130
02:30:49,059 --> 02:30:57,299
Can I get back up again? All right, hold on.

1131
02:30:57,299 --> 02:30:59,100
What if the paper got destroyed?

1132
02:31:02,659 --> 02:31:04,850
Then I'm so I don't know.

1133
02:31:04,850 --> 02:31:07,090
You know, maybe I should mess up the text a little bit.

1134
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:15,569
So you have to actually decipher it.

1135
02:31:15,569 --> 02:31:16,290
I actually want to do this.

1136
02:31:16,290 --> 02:31:23,180
So I got to get the plan.

1137
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:25,420
Do you really want to you really want to get weird here?

1138
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:28,590
Yeah, there will be.

1139
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:31,200
So you guys right now,

1140
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,000
my great, great, great, great grandchildren

1141
02:31:34,559 --> 02:31:38,319
will be able to watch this stream and potentially see what you're writing.

1142
02:31:42,590 --> 02:31:44,629
Do you understand how fucking strange that is?

1143
02:31:44,629 --> 02:31:48,860
You understand how bizarre that is?

1144
02:31:48,899 --> 02:31:50,979
We always look at photos of old stuff.

1145
02:31:51,739 --> 02:31:55,299
It's just a picture of your great, great grandfather.

1146
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,680
Like that. And that's it.

1147
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:04,559
And he was a he worked at a he was he was a he was a blacksmith or something, right?

1148
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:10,500
Every booger eating comment I've made,

1149
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:13,059
my great, great, great, great grandkids will be able to see it.

1150
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:17,379
So this is where it starts.

1151
02:32:17,739 --> 02:32:20,659
Hi, kids. It's your great, great, great, great, great grandfather.

1152
02:32:21,579 --> 02:32:26,979
What I have done is I have buried secret family treasure somewhere.

1153
02:32:27,739 --> 02:32:31,479
And you are going to start your journey right now in the attic.

1154
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:35,079
There is a piece of paper on that piece of paper

1155
02:32:35,559 --> 02:32:37,680
is a note with some instructions on it.

1156
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:41,120
And I'm going to tell you the one hint you'll get here.

1157
02:32:44,129 --> 02:32:49,920
Doll doll.

1158
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:52,159
And I'm going to put it in a fucking doll or something.

1159
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,899
And that's how they can start doll.

1160
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:01,739
And then they're going to go on an adventure.

1161
02:33:18,170 --> 02:33:21,200
You spoiling it in the Vod.

1162
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:26,200
Well, what? No, no, no. What we'll do is we'll clip that section

1163
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:29,040
and then I'll delete the Vod. Right.

1164
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:33,389
I'm just I'm just losing. I'm not even paying attention.

1165
02:33:38,219 --> 02:33:39,379
How cool would that be, though?

1166
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:41,420
Can you imagine? I'm going to do it.

1167
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:43,420
You guys think I'm screwing around. I'm going to do this.

1168
02:33:44,459 --> 02:33:46,809
I am going to make it.

1169
02:33:46,809 --> 02:33:50,370
I'm going to do a big treasure hunt thing for my great, great, great grandkids.

1170
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:54,979
You know, the equivalent of OK, imagine the old photo.

1171
02:33:55,540 --> 02:33:58,260
You're right now your great, great, great grandmother or something.

1172
02:33:58,739 --> 02:34:01,190
It was like like on the back.

1173
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:04,469
You turn it over and it's the secret is in the doll.

1174
02:34:05,629 --> 02:34:09,000
And then you remember, oh, wait, great, great.

1175
02:34:09,159 --> 02:34:11,760
Yeah, the doll that's up in the attic.

1176
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:12,959
What does that mean?

1177
02:34:12,959 --> 02:34:14,440
And they like take it apart or something.

1178
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:16,760
And oh, there's a there's a there's a map in here.

1179
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:20,940
That's what I'm doing for my grandkids right now.

1180
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:23,819
So just wait, just wait another like 400 or 500 years.

1181
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:26,819
And they'll figure it out.

1182
02:34:26,819 --> 02:34:27,819
And it's going to be so cool.

1183
02:34:27,819 --> 02:34:28,979
And I'm going to go on.

1184
02:34:28,979 --> 02:34:30,020
They're going to be a news article about it.

1185
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:34,639
It's going to be awesome.

1186
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:37,459
It's like, oh, it'll be like on Reddit.

1187
02:34:37,459 --> 02:34:40,260
I found an old buried stream post

1188
02:34:40,579 --> 02:34:42,260
from my great, great, great grandfather.

1189
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:48,620
He put us on a treasure hunt.

1190
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:51,260
Oh, yeah, old school, like subreddit, right?

1191
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:56,899
And then when they get to the treasure,

1192
02:34:56,899 --> 02:34:58,700
like I say, I'm going to do all this, like, oh, wait, wait,

1193
02:34:58,700 --> 02:34:59,780
there's a secret family recipe.

1194
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:03,219
No, it's just me like smoking crack, you know, like a Polaroid.

1195
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:07,420
And that's all it is.

1196
02:35:07,459 --> 02:35:09,219
And then, oh, they're going to be they're going to feel real bad

1197
02:35:09,219 --> 02:35:41,629
about writing those articles.

1198
02:35:41,629 --> 02:35:46,059
What if you don't have grandkids?

1199
02:35:46,059 --> 02:35:47,180
I don't know.

1200
02:35:47,180 --> 02:35:51,780
Then just delete this because then I'll I don't know.

1201
02:35:52,729 --> 02:35:54,209
Why would anybody have left?

1202
02:35:54,209 --> 02:35:56,329
By the way, if you want to give me shit for that,

1203
02:35:56,329 --> 02:36:00,290
why did anyone leave a secret fucking family treasure recipe for anybody?

1204
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:04,350
No, no, I'm not going to leave the treasure hunt.

1205
02:36:04,350 --> 02:36:06,629
What if I don't have grandkids?

1206
02:36:06,629 --> 02:36:12,780
At that point, I would have known, right?

1207
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:14,620
If you're that old and you don't have grant, you're like,

1208
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:16,989
of course, it's not going to happen.

1209
02:36:16,989 --> 02:36:24,209
I can give it to somebody else.

1210
02:36:24,209 --> 02:36:28,780
Remember, you don't have to leave family treasure hunts.

1211
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:35,540
So write the clues in the library books.

1212
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:46,420
Yeah, let grandpa have it.

1213
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:48,700
Yeah. What do you mean? What? Oh, why?

1214
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:50,459
Why? Who cares? Why wouldn't you?

1215
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:54,530
What if you if you wanted to?

1216
02:36:54,530 --> 02:36:58,020
By the way, grandkids be the letter B.

1217
02:36:58,260 --> 02:36:59,760
Look for it.

1218
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:02,000
I may have wrote it on the ceiling in the bathroom.

1219
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,799
And then underneath that fucking ceiling tile,

1220
02:37:03,799 --> 02:37:06,959
there could be the next step in your journey.

1221
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,500
Look for the letter B somewhere, right?

1222
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:46,549
Where do I go? Where do I actually go?

1223
02:37:46,549 --> 02:37:49,370
Why would they watch this VOD?

1224
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:52,209
How would it be a secret treasure hunt if I made it easy?

1225
02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:55,809
There's thousands of pieces of media that I've been in.

1226
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:15,709
Do you want me to make it easy?

1227
02:38:15,709 --> 02:38:17,909
I want to be a secret family treasure hunt.

1228
02:38:26,219 --> 02:38:28,659
Jerma is trying to give his ancestors a lot of leeway

1229
02:38:28,659 --> 02:38:33,299
if he's expecting a random ceiling tile not to be replaced in 400 years.

1230
02:38:39,069 --> 02:38:40,709
That house probably won't even exist.

1231
02:38:40,709 --> 02:38:47,340
Just like bulldozer.

1232
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:49,659
Well, how did anybody leave anything like that? Right.

1233
02:38:49,899 --> 02:38:56,059
But just have to bury it somewhere.

1234
02:38:56,059 --> 02:38:57,500
How would that even work? Yeah.

1235
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:13,989
How did anybody find anything secret?

1236
02:39:13,989 --> 02:39:18,450
This doesn't happen in real life, dude.

1237
02:39:18,450 --> 02:39:28,319
Hasn't it once? It has. Yeah, it has.

1238
02:39:32,850 --> 02:39:34,569
Yes, it does. Yes, it does.

1239
02:39:34,569 --> 02:39:36,610
Yeah. So what the hell? Yeah, I could make it happen.

1240
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:03,469
I know I'm going to probably jump on those, right?

1241
02:40:03,469 --> 02:40:12,219
One of these I'm going to jump on top of. No.

1242
02:40:19,389 --> 02:40:22,270
Your grandkids are going to see a really enlarged picture of your ass.

1243
02:40:25,979 --> 02:40:27,569
Yeah, I know.

1244
02:40:27,569 --> 02:40:30,530
Why do you think I'm trying to figure out and food stuff to leave them?

1245
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:36,709
They're going to take one bite of the egg salad and go, wow,

1246
02:40:36,709 --> 02:40:39,590
this is actually on par with that ass photo.

1247
02:40:40,940 --> 02:41:04,920
I'm so glad he left it for us.

1248
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:06,200
Wait, that's a key.

1249
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:11,799
Are we going to be trapped here?

1250
02:41:11,799 --> 02:41:30,129
I jumped over that. Oh, it's the dog.

1251
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:47,170
That was a triple right there.

1252
02:41:47,170 --> 02:41:49,370
Adjusted for inflation, you're going to give them like three dollars.

1253
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:54,920
I'll do the math and shit. I'll calculate it.

1254
02:41:54,920 --> 02:42:00,739
Let me out.

1255
02:42:00,739 --> 02:42:02,819
So in like a thousand years or something, they find it.

1256
02:42:03,979 --> 02:42:06,299
What I said I was going to do by five grand.

1257
02:42:06,299 --> 02:42:08,979
I'll put like, I don't know, put like five hundred grand in there.

1258
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:11,079
Well, no, I can't do that.

1259
02:42:15,079 --> 02:42:28,340
No, I'm not. Never mind.

1260
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:31,090
No, no. How about this?

1261
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:34,409
The only way you can get the money is there's I don't know.

1262
02:42:34,409 --> 02:42:38,170
There's a code attached to it that you can only know if you

1263
02:42:38,489 --> 02:42:41,770
if you like spread my recipe on whatever tick tock of that time is

1264
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:45,370
I got to figure out a way to make it so like you got to.

1265
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:47,530
I've got to be popular.

1266
02:42:47,530 --> 02:42:49,610
I've got my recipe is going to be popular.

1267
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:51,700
It's going to be a huge deal.

1268
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:54,940
And like only then when this exact account that, by the way,

1269
02:42:55,299 --> 02:42:58,620
I made an account on on tick tock and this account.

1270
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:00,579
Here's the username and password.

1271
02:43:00,579 --> 02:43:05,260
This account must get five to ten, at least 5000

1272
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:10,139
likes on a egg salad video of my recipe or it will not unlock.

1273
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:26,120
That's kind of fun.

1274
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:28,520
And the first thing you're going to be in a video with like a suit on.

1275
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:30,940
I go, you found it.

1276
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,750
Like, you know, I always do that.

1277
02:43:33,870 --> 02:43:36,870
Like the rich asshole is here recording a video.

1278
02:43:36,870 --> 02:43:39,309
And let me tell you, oh, so you found it.

1279
02:43:40,549 --> 02:43:43,069
What you need to do is you need to make sure that you.

1280
02:43:43,069 --> 02:43:58,600
Yeah, I'll go and I'll do a whole spiel.

1281
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:12,459
Did I miss something over here?

1282
02:44:12,459 --> 02:44:14,340
He's a goose laying his own eggs.

1283
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:15,659
What does that mean? What's that? What's that?

1284
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:18,500
What's that mean?

1285
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:20,540
It's going to be a sentient AI of you by then.

1286
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:22,979
Not if I have a no sentient AI clause,

1287
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:28,940
not if I make sure to tell my lawyers that under no circumstances

1288
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:32,500
am I going to be a sentient AI and when we all sign it and it's fucking,

1289
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:33,979
you can't do it.

1290
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:48,729
Not if I put it a clause somewhere, I'll do it illegally.

1291
02:44:48,969 --> 02:44:52,729
But you're going to have to answer to the estate because I put it in a contract.

1292
02:44:55,909 --> 02:44:58,750
I like the fact that you're asking for clout even after you're dead.

1293
02:45:03,950 --> 02:45:05,430
No, I don't want the clout.

1294
02:45:05,430 --> 02:45:15,579
I want my recipe to have the clout.

1295
02:45:15,579 --> 02:45:17,780
Your consciousness is going to be free by then.

1296
02:45:20,959 --> 02:45:37,540
No, it's not.

1297
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:40,059
Yeah, I only want my recipe to have clout, not me.

1298
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:53,899
Your consciousness is going to eventually enter public domain.

1299
02:45:56,819 --> 02:45:58,899
Bro, I have not had enough beer to talk.

1300
02:45:58,899 --> 02:46:01,540
I have not smoked enough fucking weed to have this conversation

1301
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:05,899
because what you just said is crazy and actually somehow makes bizarre sense.

1302
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:47,940
Shit, this is a perfect run.

1303
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:48,940
Stop talking about drugs.

1304
02:46:48,940 --> 02:46:54,659
My daughter watches you.

1305
02:46:54,659 --> 02:46:57,219
Hey, put your audience warning with this room.

1306
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:05,579
Is this game pretty poggers?

1307
02:47:05,579 --> 02:47:08,409
It's it's all right. I think it's fun.

1308
02:47:08,409 --> 02:47:11,770
It's look, this would be a great game to sit down and play

1309
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:15,629
with your grandchildren.

1310
02:47:15,629 --> 02:47:17,270
Hey, grandkids, how are you?

1311
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:19,290
It's me, Jeremy again.

1312
02:47:19,290 --> 02:47:21,870
We're Aunt Pot, Jeremy.

1313
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:25,520
I heard you found the note that I left you.

1314
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:29,180
Let me tell you something.

1315
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:33,479
Hold on. I don't want to lose.

1316
02:47:33,479 --> 02:47:34,719
Why would it be the same bot?

1317
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:36,319
That's not fair. This is OK.

1318
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:38,639
Remind me in like five years to do this again.

1319
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:46,139
Because they need the second half of the code.

1320
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:57,639
What's happening here?

1321
02:47:57,639 --> 02:47:58,399
Does it work?

1322
02:47:58,399 --> 02:48:10,489
What's going on?

1323
02:48:10,489 --> 02:48:18,989
Wait, what was I supposed to lose?

1324
02:48:18,989 --> 02:48:20,309
Oh, I already saw this cut scene.

1325
02:48:20,309 --> 02:48:22,979
Wow. I was not paying any attention.

1326
02:48:26,899 --> 02:48:29,930
OK. OK.

1327
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:30,409
All right. All right.

1328
02:48:30,409 --> 02:48:32,569
So they're all they're all yellow now.

1329
02:48:33,450 --> 02:48:46,440
Now what? Oh, OK.

1330
02:48:48,989 --> 02:48:52,860
I get it. I get it.

1331
02:48:52,860 --> 02:48:55,540
I was supposed to go, go, go, go, go.

1332
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:58,620
When I accidentally went, went, went, went, went, went.

1333
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:06,250
Those are supposed to do it the other way.

1334
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:33,170
No, not as hard as music sounds like fantasy.

1335
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:50,389
Oh, oh, not as hard.

1336
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:52,770
Why are there still people here?

1337
02:49:52,770 --> 02:50:11,409
But stop.

1338
02:50:11,409 --> 02:50:13,090
Oh, my God.

1339
02:50:13,090 --> 02:50:18,860
OK, this is just annoying.

1340
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:36,770
Everyone's a hate watcher.

1341
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:39,530
You. Oh, my God.

1342
02:50:40,569 --> 02:50:43,450
You'd be a great politician because you have no soul.

1343
02:50:47,280 --> 02:50:49,940
Whoa. Whoa, man.

1344
02:50:52,379 --> 02:51:20,329
Do you need to relax?

1345
02:51:20,329 --> 02:51:22,290
Oh, you want something insane?

1346
02:51:22,290 --> 02:51:25,409
OK, so last night, please.

1347
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:32,420
Last night or the night before, I had 10 dreams in a row.

1348
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:36,139
And Holly was was next to me.

1349
02:51:36,139 --> 02:51:38,780
And I kept on being in a dream.

1350
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:41,370
I would go to bed.

1351
02:51:41,370 --> 02:51:46,059
She would hear me go, hmm.

1352
02:51:47,459 --> 02:51:48,700
And she'd go, hey, hey.

1353
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:51,860
And I go, oh, and it happened like 10 fucking times in a row.

1354
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:54,280
I was stun locked in a dream.

1355
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:56,520
It was ridiculous. It was so bad.

1356
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,319
Because, you know, anytime you dream

1357
02:51:58,319 --> 02:51:59,600
and you wake up from a dream and you go back

1358
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:03,200
and you have a second dream right after immediately after, it usually stops.

1359
02:52:04,559 --> 02:52:06,840
After the second, third and fourth time of that happening,

1360
02:52:07,719 --> 02:52:11,520
you sit there in this weird, panicked mode where you go, oh, my God,

1361
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:13,399
I don't want to go back to bed.

1362
02:52:13,399 --> 02:52:14,680
Is it just going to happen again?

1363
02:52:14,680 --> 02:52:17,389
Why am I a dog?

1364
02:52:17,389 --> 02:52:18,950
Yeah, like.

1365
02:52:37,930 --> 02:52:39,290
They always do that.

1366
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:40,450
They always go.

1367
02:52:50,290 --> 02:52:53,450
But no, and so in one of the times, I'll tell you, it was so strange.

1368
02:52:54,409 --> 02:52:56,649
After the fourth or fifth time,

1369
02:52:56,649 --> 02:52:59,409
and they were such small, short dreams that made no sense.

1370
02:53:00,549 --> 02:53:02,309
I remember one of them.

1371
02:53:02,309 --> 02:53:05,030
Remember, I had to try to remember five to 10 of these in a row.

1372
02:53:06,069 --> 02:53:09,510
One of them where it was, I was in the hallway

1373
02:53:09,829 --> 02:53:12,030
where the bedroom is over here, I was in the hallway.

1374
02:53:13,350 --> 02:53:17,989
And I went into the opened up the bedroom door and it was like,

1375
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:21,670
but there was no bed in there.

1376
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:22,989
It was empty.

1377
02:53:22,989 --> 02:53:27,719
But in the room instead was just an empty room with no bed

1378
02:53:28,399 --> 02:53:32,860
and in a line facing the other way, one, two, three, four.

1379
02:53:33,379 --> 02:53:36,379
And then another line, one, two, three, four, looking this way,

1380
02:53:36,780 --> 02:53:40,459
which is these people in and they have white hair

1381
02:53:40,940 --> 02:53:44,379
and these black capes, just black cloaks

1382
02:53:44,700 --> 02:53:47,459
all standing and staring away from the door.

1383
02:53:49,389 --> 02:53:51,510
It was strange.

1384
02:53:52,149 --> 02:53:53,469
One of the other times.

1385
02:53:53,469 --> 02:53:56,389
So eventually, I know who fucking cares if I'm losing in this game.

1386
02:53:56,389 --> 02:53:58,299
Do you really care?

1387
02:53:58,299 --> 02:54:00,819
When I woke up

1388
02:54:00,819 --> 02:54:04,899
one of the last times because Holly had been waking me up over and over again.

1389
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:08,680
And again, I fall asleep, I wake up

1390
02:54:09,280 --> 02:54:11,440
and will wake up in the dream, essentially.

1391
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:16,360
So I fall asleep and there I am in that same area away from the bedroom.

1392
02:54:17,299 --> 02:54:20,500
And I was maybe 10 feet away from the bedroom door again.

1393
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:24,420
But this time I knew that Holly was going to wake me up,

1394
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:26,899
but I was sitting there going, oh, shit.

1395
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:28,979
No, I'm too far away.

1396
02:54:28,979 --> 02:54:30,100
I'm not in the bedroom.

1397
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:33,059
I won't hear her wake me up next to me.

1398
02:54:33,659 --> 02:54:34,780
I'm too far away.

1399
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:37,530
I can't I won't be able to hear her.

1400
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:43,750
It's hard. You want psychedelics? No.

1401
02:54:59,170 --> 02:55:00,290
What is he talking about?

1402
02:55:00,290 --> 02:55:13,459
I'm talking about a dream, dude.

1403
02:55:13,459 --> 02:55:16,100
And apparently, every time I was just I was just doing the

1404
02:55:20,739 --> 02:55:24,659
just breathing, just

1405
02:55:38,979 --> 02:55:40,340
did you eat before bed?

1406
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:43,219
I think I mean, I usually don't get that close to bed.

1407
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:54,659
Dogs are so funny, though.

1408
02:55:54,659 --> 02:55:56,020
I don't get it.

1409
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:57,860
I know that they're just built so dear.

1410
02:55:57,860 --> 02:56:00,020
I can't beat this because I don't.

1411
02:56:00,020 --> 02:56:01,219
I'm all right. Let me listen to me.

1412
02:56:01,219 --> 02:56:06,510
I'm why I just pause the game.

1413
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:10,739
So Otto will put his head down to be OK.

1414
02:56:10,739 --> 02:56:11,899
It's time for bed. Oh, yeah.

1415
02:56:11,899 --> 02:56:15,020
He gets comfortable asleep.

1416
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:18,459
I wish I had that ability.

1417
02:56:18,459 --> 02:56:23,459
Dogs can just go right to sleep in a deep REM sleep immediately.

1418
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:36,200
I envy it so much.

1419
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:39,059
I'm not going to lose this again.

1420
02:56:39,059 --> 02:56:58,780
It's embarrassing if I don't beat this now.

1421
02:56:58,780 --> 02:57:19,739
You're so bad at aiming back, man.

1422
02:57:19,739 --> 02:57:25,149
All right. Here we go.

1423
02:57:25,149 --> 02:57:32,579
Oh, this is itchy.

1424
02:57:32,579 --> 02:57:46,530
What do I go for that?

1425
02:57:46,530 --> 02:58:06,319
I don't know. I don't know.

1426
02:58:06,319 --> 02:58:07,719
I last month.

1427
02:59:01,370 --> 02:59:04,829
Take a booger snack break.

1428
02:59:04,829 --> 02:59:07,870
This is it is going to be so huge in like a few days and I'm pissed about it.

1429
02:59:11,979 --> 02:59:54,420
From the umpire mask.

1430
02:59:54,420 --> 02:59:56,620
Would you rather fight this boss of the nameless king?

1431
02:59:58,430 --> 03:00:00,950
When is the Elden Ring DLC?

1432
03:00:00,950 --> 03:00:11,579
We're going to get me. What do you think?

1433
03:00:11,579 --> 03:00:23,479
That was a huge burp, and I'm so glad that you heard it.

1434
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,959
There 100 percent will be.

1435
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:28,280
I saw this thing where people said the time frame

1436
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:30,799
between when the other from software games came out

1437
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:34,120
and when DLC came out, we're pretty much at that point.

1438
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:39,260
We're after about 10 months or so, right?

1439
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:41,500
It's when we should think about maybe getting an announcement.

1440
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:42,940
Depends on how big it is.

1441
03:00:42,940 --> 03:00:48,659
Maybe it takes more time to do this one.

1442
03:00:48,659 --> 03:00:50,459
Excuse me. Give me a break.

1443
03:00:50,459 --> 03:00:54,979
Pay attention. Please have help on you.

1444
03:00:58,520 --> 03:01:13,149
What the fuck?

1445
03:01:13,190 --> 03:01:14,510
What? Well, I'm alive.

1446
03:01:14,510 --> 03:01:16,110
What? How am I alive? What happened?

1447
03:01:16,110 --> 03:01:18,309
What the fuck just happened? Why am I alive?

1448
03:01:18,309 --> 03:01:41,500
I had no help. I'm dead now.

1449
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:43,700
How are you supposed to avoid getting hit by that?

1450
03:01:45,379 --> 03:01:49,219
You have to hold this.

1451
03:01:49,219 --> 03:01:57,739
I don't know how you avoid that.

1452
03:01:57,739 --> 03:02:00,780
I have to dash. There's no area to dash.

1453
03:02:00,819 --> 03:02:03,459
Why is it so much harder than the whole rest of the entire video game?

1454
03:02:03,819 --> 03:02:21,649
I only have eight lives left.

1455
03:02:21,649 --> 03:02:22,809
I have to run towards it.

1456
03:02:22,809 --> 03:02:33,459
I don't know. How the fuck did you beat millennia?

1457
03:02:34,020 --> 03:02:42,520
Yeah, you think I'm paying that much attention to the Pac-Man game

1458
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,840
because I am a good player in Dark Souls games.

1459
03:02:47,739 --> 03:02:52,299
Doesn't necessarily translate to a Pac-Man remake game

1460
03:02:52,299 --> 03:02:53,540
that like we're just talking about.

1461
03:02:53,540 --> 03:02:56,700
Like we're talking about my descendants

1462
03:02:57,739 --> 03:02:59,100
and me eating boogers and stuff.

1463
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:02,420
I'm not locked in playing against millennia.

1464
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:06,100
You can call that Kopeem if you want, but I did.

1465
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:07,620
I beat millennia.

1466
03:03:07,620 --> 03:03:08,940
So I'm sorry.

1467
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:12,780
You cannot say that I'm a bad gamer because that exists.

1468
03:03:13,299 --> 03:03:14,860
This I'm having a bad day.

1469
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:16,420
OK, I'm having a bad day.

1470
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:17,979
I have my gamer license.

1471
03:03:17,979 --> 03:03:19,780
I don't need to renew it right now.

1472
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:22,420
I don't need to renew it at Pac-Man World Remake.

1473
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:28,180
My license is not up for renewal yet.

1474
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:43,459
I don't have to do that.

1475
03:03:43,459 --> 03:03:48,840
It's not remake, it's repack through.

1476
03:03:51,180 --> 03:04:02,579
All right.

1477
03:04:02,579 --> 03:04:04,620
I just have to beat it before he does that again.

1478
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:06,219
Like a few more times.

1479
03:04:29,030 --> 03:04:52,920
What the fuck? It's broken.

1480
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:54,959
No! What the fuck?

1481
03:04:54,959 --> 03:04:56,840
I keep missing it.

1482
03:05:05,569 --> 03:05:17,100
Good thing you slept mid fight pretending to be a dog.

1483
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:21,159
I didn't do that when I played against millennia.

1484
03:05:21,159 --> 03:05:24,659
There you go. There's your difference.

1485
03:05:24,659 --> 03:05:28,979
I wasn't pretending to sleep like a dog when I was very focused.

1486
03:06:06,420 --> 03:06:09,180
Hey, what if you wore roller skates and got pushed down a hill?

1487
03:06:13,139 --> 03:06:19,420
Like an old Jerry Lewis movie?

1488
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:22,059
You mean, I don't know how to roller skate.

1489
03:06:22,059 --> 03:06:26,030
Whoa!

1490
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:29,750
And it's a bunch of comedy where I'm going really fast.

1491
03:06:29,750 --> 03:06:33,229
And I block my eyes because I'm about to hit a truck.

1492
03:06:33,229 --> 03:06:38,430
And then I go under the truck and I go, oh, oh, baby carriage,

1493
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:40,469
baby carriage and mom.

1494
03:06:40,469 --> 03:06:43,950
Oh, and then I go, I hit the baby carriage and boom,

1495
03:06:43,950 --> 03:06:45,670
I got the baby in my arms.

1496
03:06:45,670 --> 03:06:47,950
Oh, oh, my God.

1497
03:06:47,950 --> 03:06:50,590
And then I make it to a bakery, right?

1498
03:06:50,590 --> 03:06:52,469
And like the baker, I drop the baby.

1499
03:06:52,469 --> 03:06:55,790
The baker catches the baby in a bunch of like dough or something, right?

1500
03:06:56,590 --> 03:06:59,510
Yeah. And then finally, I make it all the way down.

1501
03:07:16,069 --> 03:07:17,270
Excuse me.

1502
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:19,989
I was about to think about stopping playing this game

1503
03:07:20,709 --> 03:07:22,430
until I just saw the next area.

1504
03:07:22,430 --> 03:07:24,950
So I'm sorry, we're staying.

1505
03:07:24,950 --> 03:07:28,709
I was literally I was literally about to say, hey, let's go.

1506
03:07:28,709 --> 03:07:30,069
Let's check out another game.

1507
03:07:30,069 --> 03:07:51,840
No. Cool.

1508
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:54,920
I mean, some of the music really just kind of sound like it's coming out

1509
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:57,280
of an AM radio in a car.

1510
03:07:57,280 --> 03:08:11,139
And am I the only one that's hearing that?

1511
03:08:11,139 --> 03:08:16,920
It sounds weird. Where's the two?

1512
03:08:38,110 --> 03:08:39,750
That was simple.

1513
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:43,819
I could have made that any easier.

1514
03:08:43,819 --> 03:08:46,139
Can you please get the world record for clapping?

1515
03:08:46,139 --> 03:09:01,569
Yeah, sure, I'll do it right now.

1516
03:09:01,569 --> 03:09:03,239
How many is it in one second?

1517
03:09:03,239 --> 03:09:17,059
I could probably do it.

1518
03:09:17,059 --> 03:09:20,219
How many how many claps in one second is the world record?

1519
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:45,879
How many? The one minute record is eleven hundred.

1520
03:10:02,750 --> 03:10:05,149
Eleven hundred in a minute is how many in a second?

1521
03:10:08,879 --> 03:10:11,319
Eighteen claps in one second.

1522
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:19,979
OK, I need to slow this down.

1523
03:10:19,979 --> 03:10:22,729
Brrrr. Brrrr.

1524
03:10:22,729 --> 03:10:24,930
How many was that was?

1525
03:10:24,930 --> 03:10:28,290
But the the the the the the the the the I think that's ten.

1526
03:10:29,090 --> 03:10:31,809
Brrrr. You can't do 18 in one second.

1527
03:10:34,420 --> 03:10:37,629
Think about how fast that is. Brrrr.

1528
03:10:38,389 --> 03:10:40,350
I think that was me doing the like

1529
03:10:40,350 --> 03:10:43,309
that was like the the the the the that was probably 15 times.

1530
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:54,979
How do you physically do that?

1531
03:10:54,979 --> 03:10:57,899
I can do like the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the.

1532
03:10:58,340 --> 03:11:00,620
I probably do like six or like ten.

1533
03:11:00,620 --> 03:11:07,639
That's crazy. Watch the video.

1534
03:11:07,639 --> 03:11:32,579
There's a video. It's time to.

1535
03:11:32,579 --> 03:11:49,139
OK, there's an ad. Just hold on.

1536
03:11:49,139 --> 03:11:52,979
OK, so this is the world record.

1537
03:11:52,979 --> 03:11:56,049
This is the world record you're saying right here.

1538
03:11:56,049 --> 03:12:03,729
World record most claps in one minute.

1539
03:12:03,729 --> 03:12:06,530
Well, they have to show it.

1540
03:12:06,530 --> 03:12:07,729
Wait, what?

1541
03:12:07,729 --> 03:12:08,969
Hello, my name is seven.

1542
03:12:08,969 --> 03:12:11,530
I'm going to try to break the record

1543
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:13,090
of speed clapping.

1544
03:12:13,090 --> 03:12:15,110
We're going to start.

1545
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:17,540
So, you know, the market said.

1546
03:12:17,540 --> 03:12:26,659
Wait, what? Oh, what is happening here?

1547
03:12:34,739 --> 03:12:36,379
This music does not fit.

1548
03:12:36,379 --> 03:12:59,010
Can I just say, wow, I'm so confused.

1549
03:12:59,049 --> 03:13:02,030
So he is essentially sliding.

1550
03:13:04,809 --> 03:13:06,649
This is one hand clapping.

1551
03:13:06,649 --> 03:13:23,389
What? But in slow mo, I don't even have to.

1552
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:38,659
OK, so I see what's going on.

1553
03:13:43,219 --> 03:13:46,700
So he's he's hitting the bottom part of his palm

1554
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:50,219
with the top of his fingers on the opposite hand.

1555
03:13:50,219 --> 03:13:54,020
So he's going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

1556
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:58,750
Let me try.

1557
03:13:58,750 --> 03:14:01,819
So it's it's like here and then here.

1558
03:14:01,819 --> 03:14:02,659
So that he's hitting.

1559
03:14:02,659 --> 03:14:19,290
This is where the contact is, is here and here.

1560
03:14:19,290 --> 03:14:24,709
Ah, how do you do that for a full minute?

1561
03:14:29,350 --> 03:14:42,309
Bad form. How do you do that for a minute?

1562
03:14:42,309 --> 03:14:43,819
Go for it for a minute.

1563
03:14:43,819 --> 03:14:59,579
All right. I'm going to do it for a minute. Time me.

1564
03:14:59,579 --> 03:15:00,819
You guys, should we time me?

1565
03:15:00,819 --> 03:15:02,979
Turn the. OK, let me let me get my noise gate off.

1566
03:15:02,979 --> 03:15:38,100
Hold on. OK. All right. That's fine.

1567
03:15:38,100 --> 03:15:40,829
All right. Let me try it.

1568
03:15:40,829 --> 03:15:44,350
Is that better? Is the noise gate gone?

1569
03:15:44,350 --> 03:15:50,000
OK, here we go.

1570
03:15:50,000 --> 03:16:02,709
Three, two, one timing.

1571
03:16:39,319 --> 03:16:53,069
My arms are fucking burning.

1572
03:16:53,069 --> 03:16:56,700
I'm still down there.

1573
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:58,100
Don't do it down there.

1574
03:16:58,100 --> 03:16:59,760
Don't do it down here.

1575
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:03,100
Don't do that down here.

1576
03:17:03,100 --> 03:17:05,700
You do not want the sound of me playing while I'm doing it down here.

1577
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:11,780
That is so much strength to do that.

1578
03:17:11,780 --> 03:17:16,579
Even just fucking faking it, even just faking it.

1579
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:20,360
That hurt bad. That's unbelievable.

1580
03:17:23,700 --> 03:17:25,620
That takes actual talent and skill to do that.

1581
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:39,360
OK, let's go.

1582
03:17:39,399 --> 03:17:42,500
You had me for a little bit.

1583
03:17:42,500 --> 03:18:08,850
Pac-Man. Oh, yeah.

1584
03:18:08,850 --> 03:18:28,219
That was such a weird. Oh, yeah.

1585
03:18:28,219 --> 03:18:35,979
Don't even turn his whole arm weighs five pounds.

1586
03:18:36,059 --> 03:18:39,360
Yeah. What do you think?

1587
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:41,500
Now you say that again.

1588
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:42,540
Let's say that again.

1589
03:18:42,540 --> 03:18:44,719
That's what you think.

1590
03:18:44,719 --> 03:18:58,500
I got a big fucking arm.

1591
03:18:58,500 --> 03:18:59,459
The same thing happens again.

1592
03:18:59,459 --> 03:19:02,129
I'm going to scream.

1593
03:19:02,129 --> 03:19:03,610
Nice turkey arms.

1594
03:19:03,610 --> 03:19:06,340
Ah, that's fine. Call me a turkey.

1595
03:19:06,340 --> 03:19:07,579
Oh, he's got a turkey neck.

1596
03:19:07,579 --> 03:19:08,899
He's got turkey on turkey.

1597
03:19:08,899 --> 03:19:11,020
Turkeys are one of the most vicious fucking animals on earth.

1598
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:13,739
They're so deadly and they're crazy.

1599
03:19:13,739 --> 03:19:16,340
They will attack you and they're very deadly.

1600
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:20,819
They're incredibly strong.

1601
03:19:20,819 --> 03:19:23,059
You ever seen a turkey?

1602
03:19:23,059 --> 03:19:25,100
You guys actually seen a turkey in real life?

1603
03:19:25,100 --> 03:19:27,579
They are massive, majestic pieces.

1604
03:19:28,780 --> 03:19:31,579
They're huge and they're very dangerous.

1605
03:19:52,510 --> 03:19:53,909
Turkeys are docile.

1606
03:19:53,909 --> 03:20:11,079
Turkeys are very, very strong.

1607
03:20:11,079 --> 03:20:12,760
You know, like the zodiac signs.

1608
03:20:12,760 --> 03:20:40,670
I wish mine was a turkey.

1609
03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:41,909
These games get pretty good graphics.

1610
03:20:41,909 --> 03:20:56,709
This is a cute game.

1611
03:20:56,750 --> 03:20:59,340
Is there a game pivot coming soon?

1612
03:20:59,340 --> 03:21:00,620
Oh, you know what?

1613
03:21:00,620 --> 03:21:03,239
Did Vampire Survivors have an update?

1614
03:21:03,239 --> 03:21:04,079
I feel like it did.

1615
03:21:04,079 --> 03:21:05,459
Did I play it?

1616
03:21:05,459 --> 03:21:07,819
Dude, another game came out that was just,

1617
03:21:07,819 --> 03:21:09,340
it looked just like Vampire Survivors.

1618
03:21:09,340 --> 03:21:11,569
It came out like two days ago.

1619
03:21:11,569 --> 03:21:18,459
Is that one any good?

1620
03:21:18,459 --> 03:21:26,120
It's really good.

1621
03:21:26,120 --> 03:21:28,479
It's got something else, survivors.

1622
03:21:28,479 --> 03:21:30,840
It's just, it's just, it's just,

1623
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:46,420
it's just Vampire Survivors is what it looks like.

1624
03:21:46,420 --> 03:21:51,110
Oh, come on.

1625
03:21:51,110 --> 03:21:52,149
Taco Bell or McDonald's?

1626
03:21:52,149 --> 03:21:53,270
Well, that depends on what you're going to order

1627
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:56,219
from Taco Bell.

1628
03:21:56,219 --> 03:21:59,809
If your order at Taco Bell is the cheesy Gordita crunch,

1629
03:21:59,850 --> 03:22:02,700
then that's what you're going to get.

1630
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:05,819
If you get some other weird bullshit from Taco Bell

1631
03:22:05,819 --> 03:22:07,260
that's not very good, then I'm sorry.

1632
03:22:07,260 --> 03:22:08,100
I'm going to have to tell you that's,

1633
03:22:08,100 --> 03:22:15,690
I'm going to recommend not.

1634
03:22:15,690 --> 03:22:24,180
Oh, I like this level.

1635
03:22:24,180 --> 03:22:25,020
Doritos tacos.

1636
03:22:25,020 --> 03:22:29,540
Doritos tacos are, I always feel so bad eating them

1637
03:22:29,540 --> 03:22:32,059
because I just know there's almost nothing

1638
03:22:32,059 --> 03:22:34,790
that I really want in my body from that.

1639
03:22:34,790 --> 03:22:37,829
But you can't deny that it's one of the greatest tasting

1640
03:22:37,829 --> 03:22:51,239
things in the world.

1641
03:22:51,239 --> 03:22:52,079
How am I doing?

1642
03:22:52,079 --> 03:22:53,690
I'm doing okay.

1643
03:22:53,690 --> 03:22:56,600
I'm doing good.

1644
03:22:56,600 --> 03:23:02,739
I'm doing as good as I can be, right?

1645
03:23:02,739 --> 03:23:04,819
I'm on a fast stop.

1646
03:23:04,819 --> 03:23:08,100
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1647
03:23:08,100 --> 03:23:11,950
Yeah, that's, that's hard.

1648
03:23:11,950 --> 03:23:14,030
When I had my colonoscopy done,

1649
03:23:14,030 --> 03:23:16,030
I remember you have to fast for three days.

1650
03:23:18,069 --> 03:23:19,750
I think it was like three, four days.

1651
03:23:19,750 --> 03:23:22,079
You can't have food.

1652
03:23:22,079 --> 03:23:25,059
You can have clear liquids.

1653
03:23:25,059 --> 03:23:28,620
And I think that there's one or two very,

1654
03:23:28,620 --> 03:23:30,379
very basic small things,

1655
03:23:30,379 --> 03:23:34,909
but you can't eat food for three days.

1656
03:23:34,909 --> 03:23:36,989
One of the things that happens,

1657
03:23:37,030 --> 03:23:38,510
it's not the fact that not eating food

1658
03:23:38,510 --> 03:23:40,870
that is what caused me problems.

1659
03:23:40,870 --> 03:23:41,950
It's like, I can handle that.

1660
03:23:41,950 --> 03:23:44,790
Look, after a day or two where you just,

1661
03:23:44,790 --> 03:23:46,670
God, I just want a fucking steak.

1662
03:23:47,510 --> 03:23:49,270
But what really is the problem for me,

1663
03:23:49,270 --> 03:23:53,870
it's not that, it's the fact that the headache,

1664
03:23:53,870 --> 03:23:57,549
that kind of, like you haven't had no real nutrients

1665
03:23:57,549 --> 03:23:58,430
for two or three days.

1666
03:23:58,430 --> 03:24:01,790
You just have this migraine that is just awful.

1667
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:04,209
At least that's what happened to me.

1668
03:24:04,209 --> 03:24:07,860
Yeah, the actual procedure is simple.

1669
03:24:07,860 --> 03:24:11,110
It's one of the easiest things in the world.

1670
03:24:11,110 --> 03:24:13,909
It's the prep for a colonoscopy that sucks.

1671
03:24:13,909 --> 03:24:16,149
It's not, the procedure is easy.

1672
03:24:16,149 --> 03:24:19,739
It's 100% simple.

1673
03:24:19,739 --> 03:24:41,920
There's a fruit that's fond, oh, you can get it.

1674
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:45,379
All right, open that drawer.

1675
03:24:45,379 --> 03:24:54,389
I mean, how did I miss the first N?

1676
03:24:54,389 --> 03:24:55,829
Anybody pictures from the procedure?

1677
03:24:55,829 --> 03:25:00,540
I'm definitely not going to share my colonoscopy photos.

1678
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:03,899
I think that would get me banned from Twitch.

1679
03:25:03,899 --> 03:25:12,459
I don't think you can, I'm not sure you can do that.

1680
03:25:12,459 --> 03:25:14,459
You have to drink, yeah, they give you this drink

1681
03:25:14,459 --> 03:25:17,270
that you have to drink over the course of a couple of days.

1682
03:25:17,270 --> 03:25:22,260
And let me just tell you without giving you too much detail.

1683
03:25:22,260 --> 03:25:32,180
It makes you do something over and over again.

1684
03:25:32,180 --> 03:25:43,219
Just distort the image.

1685
03:25:43,219 --> 03:25:44,979
What, I wonder what?

1686
03:25:44,979 --> 03:25:48,819
You can use your imagination.

1687
03:25:48,819 --> 03:25:50,100
I want to see what the boss of this area is

1688
03:25:50,100 --> 03:25:51,860
and then we'll play either Vampire Survivors

1689
03:25:51,860 --> 03:25:54,379
or I want to, maybe I'll try that new one.

1690
03:25:54,379 --> 03:25:55,700
You guys are telling me,

1691
03:25:55,700 --> 03:26:00,420
actually figure out what the hell it's called.

1692
03:26:00,420 --> 03:26:05,309
It's called, it came out like today.

1693
03:26:05,309 --> 03:26:09,979
It's called Soul Stone Survivors Prologue.

1694
03:26:09,979 --> 03:26:11,299
It's not the full game, I guess.

1695
03:26:11,299 --> 03:26:14,659
Is that one any good?

1696
03:26:14,659 --> 03:26:22,940
I tried it.

1697
03:26:22,979 --> 03:26:37,649
It's pretty good.

1698
03:26:37,649 --> 03:26:40,010
You know, I kind of wish there was a retro mode

1699
03:26:40,010 --> 03:26:42,530
to see what this looked like 15 plus years ago,

1700
03:26:42,530 --> 03:26:53,500
whatever it was, 20 years ago.

1701
03:26:53,500 --> 03:26:54,940
Are you going to rage with Pac-Man?

1702
03:26:54,940 --> 03:26:57,700
No, I'm not.

1703
03:26:57,700 --> 03:27:05,629
I was just considering a pivot.

1704
03:27:05,629 --> 03:27:06,590
I feel like this game is pretty long.

1705
03:27:06,590 --> 03:27:22,579
It's probably at least six to seven levels long.

1706
03:27:22,579 --> 03:27:25,180
Remember, I'm the never complete a game Andy,

1707
03:27:25,180 --> 03:27:43,780
unless it's a from software game.

1708
03:27:43,780 --> 03:27:49,459
Ooh, what's in here?

1709
03:27:49,459 --> 03:27:52,299
I wouldn't need this.

1710
03:27:52,299 --> 03:27:53,579
Water or somewhere that I missed?

1711
03:27:53,579 --> 03:27:57,770
Oh well.

1712
03:27:57,770 --> 03:27:58,930
Do a BRB then switch game.

1713
03:27:58,930 --> 03:28:02,379
Yeah, that's what I'll probably end up doing.

1714
03:28:02,379 --> 03:28:09,719
I mean, is there, how far am I to the end of the game?

1715
03:28:09,719 --> 03:28:10,639
Is there another area?

1716
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:16,969
There's probably at least one more area after this.

1717
03:28:16,969 --> 03:28:30,319
Two more worlds.

1718
03:28:30,319 --> 03:28:33,579
World four of six.

1719
03:28:33,579 --> 03:28:37,700
Hmm, do I want to complete Pac-Man world

1720
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:40,840
just to say that I did?

1721
03:28:40,840 --> 03:28:47,739
Or do I leave this up to interpretation for you?

1722
03:28:47,739 --> 03:28:48,979
Because you guys, you could find out for yourself

1723
03:28:48,979 --> 03:28:51,870
what happens in the end.

1724
03:28:51,870 --> 03:28:57,059
Does the evil Pac-Man kill everyone

1725
03:28:57,059 --> 03:28:59,190
and take over Pac-World?

1726
03:28:59,190 --> 03:29:00,030
I don't know.

1727
03:29:00,030 --> 03:29:13,020
I guess, but I don't know if we're ever going to know.

1728
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:31,270
Ooh, hot plates.

1729
03:29:31,270 --> 03:29:35,659
Hmm, why?

1730
03:29:35,659 --> 03:29:42,840
I supposed to be the clown boss.

1731
03:29:42,840 --> 03:29:45,090
And then, all right, do a poll right now.

1732
03:29:45,090 --> 03:29:48,610
Should I play the new vampire survivors?

1733
03:29:51,579 --> 03:29:53,920
Vampire survivors like,

1734
03:29:53,920 --> 03:29:56,739
or should I play vampire survivors?

1735
03:29:56,739 --> 03:30:15,139
Let's do a vote.

1736
03:30:15,139 --> 03:30:26,209
Don't even fall.

1737
03:30:26,209 --> 03:30:27,690
What am I looking at here?

1738
03:30:27,690 --> 03:30:29,370
Wait, can I not?

1739
03:30:29,370 --> 03:30:32,000
Oh, right here.

1740
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:33,280
Ultra kill got an update.

1741
03:30:36,329 --> 03:30:38,690
I don't know if I'm in the first person shooter

1742
03:30:38,690 --> 03:30:46,280
crack mode right now.

1743
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:58,229
I don't think I'm in crack mode at the moment.

1744
03:31:04,940 --> 03:31:05,780
Next thing we're going to do,

1745
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:08,299
we're going to go back to sorcery part three.

1746
03:31:08,299 --> 03:31:11,399
That's what we're going to do on Wednesday.

1747
03:31:11,399 --> 03:31:21,379
And then wait, hold on.

1748
03:31:21,379 --> 03:31:24,920
All right, all right.

1749
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:27,629
So I can officially announce.

1750
03:31:27,629 --> 03:31:30,459
All right, it's time for the official announcement.

1751
03:31:30,459 --> 03:31:36,260
I, Jeremy Elbertson, AKA German985 on Thursday.

1752
03:31:37,940 --> 03:31:39,260
Ladies and gentlemen,

1753
03:31:39,260 --> 03:31:41,379
I'm going to be on Name Your Price.

1754
03:31:41,379 --> 03:31:44,670
Austin show.

1755
03:31:44,670 --> 03:31:45,510
Oh my God.

1756
03:31:45,510 --> 03:31:47,629
Why can I not just remember to press?

1757
03:31:47,629 --> 03:31:56,459
It's not the jump button.

1758
03:31:56,459 --> 03:31:58,739
I will be on Name Your Price.

1759
03:31:58,739 --> 03:32:01,780
I think I'm going to do a pretty good job.

1760
03:32:01,780 --> 03:32:04,280
What time is it going to be at?

1761
03:32:04,280 --> 03:32:08,459
I don't, I think somewhere around two Pacific.

1762
03:32:08,459 --> 03:32:14,879
I think we're around somewhere between one and two Pacific.

1763
03:32:14,879 --> 03:32:17,100
It's a game show.

1764
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:17,979
Who am I going to be against?

1765
03:32:17,979 --> 03:32:21,180
I actually don't know.

1766
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:26,840
You'll have to, you have to watch.

1767
03:32:26,840 --> 03:32:28,520
You're going to play Glover?

1768
03:32:28,520 --> 03:32:32,639
Ah, how do we watch it?

1769
03:32:32,639 --> 03:32:38,360
It's going to be on Austin show.

1770
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:43,600
You don't know Austin show.

1771
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:44,719
I would go follow it now.

1772
03:32:44,719 --> 03:32:46,959
Follow the channel.

1773
03:32:46,959 --> 03:32:58,280
Follow Austin.

1774
03:32:58,280 --> 03:33:05,069
He's a streamer.

1775
03:33:05,069 --> 03:33:05,909
Is it going to be on Twitch?

1776
03:33:05,909 --> 03:33:07,690
Yes.

1777
03:33:07,690 --> 03:33:11,770
It will be on twitch.tv.

1778
03:33:11,770 --> 03:33:12,809
I'm very excited.

1779
03:33:12,809 --> 03:33:15,059
The concept of the stream.

1780
03:33:15,059 --> 03:33:17,979
It's a game show, obviously.

1781
03:33:17,979 --> 03:33:23,319
And it's kind of like, they show products

1782
03:33:23,319 --> 03:33:25,799
and you have to guess how whoever gets closest

1783
03:33:25,799 --> 03:33:29,959
to what the actual cost of the product was or is.

1784
03:33:29,959 --> 03:33:32,799
Kind of like, almost like the prices, right?

1785
03:33:32,799 --> 03:33:35,809
Kind of style.

1786
03:33:35,809 --> 03:33:53,500
I think I'll do a pretty good job.

1787
03:33:53,500 --> 03:33:56,659
Sounds good.

1788
03:33:56,659 --> 03:33:58,770
Yeah, no, it should be fun.

1789
03:33:58,770 --> 03:34:00,379
I'm excited.

1790
03:34:00,379 --> 03:34:03,069
It's going to be in person too.

1791
03:34:03,069 --> 03:34:03,909
So it is.

1792
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:16,540
Ooh, that was a tough jump.

1793
03:34:16,540 --> 03:34:21,719
That's this Thursday at 2 p.m. Pacific

1794
03:34:21,719 --> 03:34:25,799
on Austin's channel, Austin show.

1795
03:34:25,799 --> 03:34:26,760
Are you, I'll tweet it out.

1796
03:34:26,760 --> 03:34:27,600
Yep.

1797
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:32,739
I'll make sure to tweet it so you know where it is.

1798
03:34:32,739 --> 03:34:35,500
Are you going to be cringe or funny?

1799
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:36,739
I'm going to win.

1800
03:34:36,739 --> 03:34:47,659
I'm planning to win, guys.

1801
03:34:47,659 --> 03:34:52,290
Do you even buy household products?

1802
03:34:52,290 --> 03:34:57,920
No, I haven't bought cleaning supplies in 10 years.

1803
03:34:57,920 --> 03:34:59,840
I don't even know what aisle it's in.

1804
03:34:59,840 --> 03:35:08,420
What are you talking about?

1805
03:35:08,420 --> 03:35:15,020
All right, this is it.

1806
03:35:15,020 --> 03:35:16,100
Please don't embarrass us.

1807
03:35:16,100 --> 03:35:18,870
I'm going to.

1808
03:35:18,870 --> 03:35:21,030
You're going to be ashamed that you know this channel

1809
03:35:21,030 --> 03:35:29,459
after Thursday.

1810
03:35:29,459 --> 03:35:30,299
I just fall.

1811
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:57,739
I like to clown ghosts, that's funny.

1812
03:35:57,739 --> 03:36:03,340
All right, what's the boss?

1813
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:04,540
Oh, cool, it's the same song.

1814
03:36:04,540 --> 03:36:21,280
Oh, I thought you were actually happy about that.

1815
03:36:21,280 --> 03:36:30,329
How many songs did the original one have?

1816
03:36:30,329 --> 03:36:33,979
Oh my God.

1817
03:36:33,979 --> 03:36:35,260
All right, if I die one more time,

1818
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:36,739
I'm changing to the van first.

1819
03:36:36,739 --> 03:36:38,219
Wait, did we even do a pole?

1820
03:36:38,219 --> 03:36:39,659
I completely forgot.

1821
03:36:39,659 --> 03:36:48,309
Did we run a pole?

1822
03:36:48,309 --> 03:37:17,870
So what happened?

1823
03:37:17,870 --> 03:37:20,280
Wow, I still died.

1824
03:37:29,709 --> 03:37:58,899
I'm so, I feel like my eyes just went frost.

1825
03:37:58,899 --> 03:38:18,139
Flutter to the end of the level.

1826
03:38:18,139 --> 03:38:20,409
Oh shit, I can't.

1827
03:38:20,409 --> 03:38:30,540
I'm not high enough.

1828
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:32,620
It stopped, it actually stopped.

1829
03:38:32,620 --> 03:38:33,780
I didn't stop that.

1830
03:38:33,780 --> 03:38:38,809
That, I hit the limit.

1831
03:38:38,809 --> 03:38:39,969
That's quite the limit.

1832
03:38:39,969 --> 03:38:41,290
Why even have a limit?

1833
03:38:41,329 --> 03:38:43,940
Why is there a limit at that point?

1834
03:38:43,940 --> 03:39:09,670
Is it even necessary to have a limit?

1835
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:12,469
All right, I just want to hear the clowns laugh.

1836
03:39:16,659 --> 03:39:17,540
Boss clown.

1837
03:39:19,879 --> 03:39:21,079
And then we'll move on.

1838
03:39:28,389 --> 03:39:36,799
No, I don't care, nevermind.

1839
03:39:36,799 --> 03:39:37,920
All right, what's this game called?

1840
03:39:37,920 --> 03:39:39,639
That was Pac-Man World, it was actually pretty fun.

1841
03:39:39,639 --> 03:39:41,040
It was actually a fun game.

1842
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:43,129
I just, I don't care.

1843
03:39:43,129 --> 03:39:45,459
It was fun, it was enjoyable.

1844
03:39:45,459 --> 03:39:47,180
I think it was definitely worth playing.
