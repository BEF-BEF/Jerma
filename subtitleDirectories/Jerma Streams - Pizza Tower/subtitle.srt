1
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:21,940
Alright, so this game seems pretty cool. I've seen a couple other streamers play this.

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:41,850
Definitely want to check it out at some point. Alright, so we're... I can't... It doesn't

3
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:54,789
like this controller. No. Press start to continue. Controller disconnected. What? What do you

4
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:10,030
mean? Oh, I think I turned the Xbox on. God damn it. Yeah, it's trying to turn the...

5
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:23,560
It's turning the Xbox on again. Give me one second. Let's try this again. Anyways, how

6
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:34,060
are you all doing? What's today's date anyway? Wednesday. I feel like I haven't known what

7
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:45,420
actual day it's been for the last week. Did you play any of the Wario World games? I actually

8
00:01:45,420 --> 00:02:03,200
didn't. Alright, what's going on with my controller? Stop it. So this game's about speed running,

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,650
right? This is about going really fast and getting a big high score. At least that's

10
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:52,800
what it looks like. Let's try this again. Sorry about that. Pizza tower. Hmm. I don't

11
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:24,120
know why it doesn't like this controller. Well, there's that. Start. Did the Xbox app

12
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,689
open? I don't think so. Shouldn't be. Oh, the title. One of the mods would make a good

13
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:48,139
title. I trust him. Don't worry. Okay. What the fuck? Why do you hate my controller? Hey,

14
00:03:48,139 --> 00:04:04,550
there we go. Alright. How's the audio? Good? Alright. Power status, middle, and then right.

15
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:16,180
What's the difference? What do the three TVs do? Press right trigger. Oh, it's save files.

16
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:38,939
Alright, let's go. I'm ready. The art is just so wild. It really is so cool looking. Okay.

17
00:04:38,939 --> 00:05:07,870
Why can't I move? I got art. So jump. It's a run. Okay, welcome. Alright, so where's the

18
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:30,579
up? Alright, up. Alright, so what do I, what do I do? I can't go through here. This game is cool.

19
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:49,569
Alright. Press to jump, hold down, and a direction to crawl. You can break marble and metal blocks

20
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:57,420
underneath you with a body slam. Press down while in the air. Start the body slam from

21
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:06,990
higher to destroy metal blocks. Jump blocks may be hidden. Keep an eye out for them. Press

22
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:26,050
to destroy them. Thousand bucks. The game's a little loud. Got you. I got you. That's perfect,

23
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:38,160
isn't it? Grab dash. Hold dash and jump. Hold right trigger to start a mock run. If you hold

24
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:47,069
right trigger then jump on a wall, you'll start a wall run. Oh my goodness. Alright. Do that while

25
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,980
wall running to jump off the wall. Keep right trigger held to stick on the other walls. You

26
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:07,149
can also use the grab dash to start a wall run while in the air. Got it. Is it too low? I got

27
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:24,540
a Goldilocks. Hold on. Okay. Jump after pressing in order to do a long jump. Run up a slope.

28
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:42,370
I like that sound. The volume is too medium. Sorry. Okay, hold that to destroy a block. Okay,

29
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:57,410
yep. Cool. I'm going to puke playing this game. I'm just telling you. Alright. In the air, hold

30
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:11,329
during a mock run. I think I'm going to puke. In order to destroy metal blocks,

31
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:22,259
gain speed by doing the mock run. You can hold to go faster. Running down a slope will make you go

32
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:44,990
faster. Turn while retaining mock run. Press the opposite direction. Okay. Try turning before

33
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:53,009
falling down a hole. You'll retain your speed. Ah, I see. Is that what my buddy Eric wants?

34
00:08:53,009 --> 00:09:06,379
Your buddy Eric is very well traveled. While at high speed, hold up then release to perform

35
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:16,000
the super jump. You can also adjust your position with left and right. Ah, okay. So while running.

36
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:58,379
I get it. How do I get out of this? Oh, I know. Oops. Wait to go through gaps faster. Is that

37
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:12,580
working? Press that and then down. Oh, there it is. You can grab things with the grab dash and throw

38
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:40,110
them. Okay. Put these in order to get a better rank. Some can only be acquired during the escape.

39
00:10:40,110 --> 00:11:02,929
Okay. Can't go through these. You need to save most of the dudes in the cages in order to advance

40
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,330
the next floor. They'll give you money to pay Mr. Stick. If you miss too many of them, you'll need

41
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:15,539
to replay some levels. Alright. Destroy John the pillar in order to open the exit gate. This will

42
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:51,200
reverse the solid pillar blocks. Pizza time. Ooh, it's smooth. Get out now. My eyes. John Gutter Hall.

43
00:11:51,919 --> 00:12:15,360
Power lobby. Which one should I go in? Poppins, secrets, treasures, power achievements.

44
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:40,639
All right. I'll just start at the beginning. John gutter. So just go really fast, right? That's all

45
00:12:40,639 --> 00:13:15,230
I know. You're not going fast enough. Cheese. Faster. Go faster. Faster. Am I not going fast

46
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:56,740
enough? All right. You're going to go too slow. Got it. Super taunt. What's that? I have a D.

47
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:13,039
How do I get more points quickly? Go faster. I feel like I'm going wicked fucking fast.

48
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:50,690
Back, back, back. No, no, no. This way. Come on. Do it. Go. I'm going way too slow.

49
00:14:51,490 --> 00:15:32,269
Why can I get in here? Got it. Killing things give you points. Oh my goodness. I got a B.

50
00:15:33,070 --> 00:16:04,350
How much health do you have in this game? Oh, hold on. It's infinite health. Okay. I was like

51
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:34,529
kind of scared. What do I do with this guy? I jumped over it. Whoa. You have found one secret

52
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:47,009
out of three. This isn't, I'm not going too slow, right? Okay. Make sure I'm not going too slow.

53
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:25,579
You're going too fast. Okay. I thought I just blew it. I got it. I got it. I got everything

54
00:17:25,579 --> 00:18:01,470
I needed, right? I got it. So it actually isn't about speed. Now it is. Who's this guy?

55
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:32,579
Okay. I'm so overwhelmed. All right. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. I got plenty of time. I'm

56
00:18:32,579 --> 00:19:22,430
fine. Oh shit. Go, go, go, go, go. Hit every wall. You've hurt Pepino 10 times. Why is it saying

57
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:53,329
that? Go. No, no, no, no, no, no. I got it. Come on. Give me an A. At least an A. I'm not living

58
00:19:53,329 --> 00:20:27,920
till I have an A. Bonus of the door. Just leave. Font at the door. Oh, okay. That was stressful,

59
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:39,630
but very fun. Oh, I see. I get it. So the idea is you play the same level over and over again

60
00:20:39,630 --> 00:21:05,660
to get like S speed only matters in the escape. Take your time. Okay. Cool. That's fun. All right.

61
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,210
Well, now knowing that I can take my time in the first part, what do you know about this tower?

62
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:41,819
Who are you? I don't know anything. Can I stop the rap? All right. Cool. I get it. I'm feeling it.

63
00:21:41,819 --> 00:22:15,809
Now I drop down all the screams. Lame. Why was it lame? I see where to go. All right. That's cool.

64
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:47,920
Woo woo. I don't know how to whistle. Woo woo. Whistling is so weird. No, I can't whistle. I

65
00:22:47,920 --> 00:23:00,029
don't know how. No. Every time I've ever tried to whistle, it's always just never works. I just

66
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:10,079
don't get it. Something to do with the way that my mouth and my teeth are. Just I can't do it.

67
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:21,819
I will move my lips to go to do it correctly. Tongue behind bottom teeth, lips together.

68
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:40,829
Nope. Trust me. I've sat there for hours trying to do it. That's a lie. Who spends hours trying to

69
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:46,029
whistle? Every single person either can do it or you can't. Nobody sits there for hours going,

70
00:23:46,829 --> 00:24:07,839
Oh, get out of the way. I did. You did. I definitely didn't. The guys with the forks are

71
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:26,700
annoying. Cheesy. Double jump, double jump and then down thrust. All right. That's pretty sick.

72
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:49,819
Uh, okay. Once you're going in direction, you can't stop. You're welcome. Oh, it's damn. You

73
00:24:49,819 --> 00:25:08,930
actually do get style points. I got to get down the smash the slam thing. Let's grab then throw.

74
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:35,599
Is it great? Nope. I'm actually eating pizza right now. Pizza is so good. It really is like

75
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:49,299
just like the best thing. I can't, I can't think of anybody that's ever denied pizza.

76
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,990
Just something you just don't like you can't deny. It's just, yeah, of course.

77
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:27,700
Oh, wait, can I get it again? I'll get it. Nice. I go down with it or can I even go down? I don't

78
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:42,819
know. I'm already at a B. All right. Now that people are telling me you got to go hurry up.

79
00:26:42,819 --> 00:27:12,190
You're going too slow. Faster, faster. I already freaked me out. Oh, I need to go get that guy.

80
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:44,940
Where is he? Can I take this with me? No, the game feels really fluid though. It's definitely

81
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,539
got the controls are great. Just one of those games. You have to really get down. I don't have

82
00:27:50,539 --> 00:28:07,089
it down yet, but I probably will. Yeah. They're very, very good. I want to, I wanted to get all

83
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:22,319
those help. Okay. Double jump my lead. No, no, no, I didn't, I missed the points. No,

84
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:44,210
I'm, I'm doing too well. Jumping over them. I go back slow. Andy. Hey, I'm okay with a B

85
00:28:45,170 --> 00:29:24,670
SpongeBob super taunt up and taunt. Okay. Hold up while taunting. What does it do?

86
00:29:25,470 --> 00:30:17,569
Kill everything on screen. Wait, what about that? Do I get this? Is it all right? Holy shit. The

87
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:32,900
music. Yeah, this is really, really good. B rank Barry. Not for long. Call me a rank Arnold.

88
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:59,539
That's a good thing to know. I want that. All right. I got this guy now. Can I now go in that

89
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:20,720
door? Yes. It's okay. Do it on your way back. I want that sausage. So bad. I get it. Oh my,

90
00:31:20,720 --> 00:32:02,000
right. I can do the big jump. I forgot secrets. Did I miss something? It's a game. I like it.

91
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:28,819
Oh shit. No, I didn't want to do that. It's all right. You make a mistake. I just downloaded

92
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:32,990
the game like 20 minutes ago. I swear to God. I just downloaded the game 20 minutes ago. It's

93
00:32:32,990 --> 00:33:13,069
all right. I just got the game 20 minutes ago. Get out of the way. Get out of my way. Get it.

94
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:55,819
What? What? What? No, I go in. Was that a pasta? I'm so happy that they have that person to come

95
00:33:55,819 --> 00:34:50,960
tell you what to do. What's going on? Stop. Wrong way. Oh my God. Go down. Wait, hold on.

96
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,340
I have 10 seconds. Get under there. Get go. What is he doing? What are you doing? What are you

97
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:13,940
doing? Why? I couldn't, I couldn't duck. I was, what the fuck was that? What happened? I know as I

98
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:21,679
crawl, I, I couldn't move. I was trying to do this thing where you like go like this. Oh my God.

99
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:38,380
I'm fucking pissed off. Oh my God. I'm so annoyed right now. That's, this is what I'm okay.

100
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:46,239
Let me get this down. You can, okay. You can not. It's an analog controller problem.

101
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,849
All right. So when I use my controller, it's a, it's a controller problem.

102
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:07,019
When I go down, this is a controller problem. Use D pad. Okay. You just saved the whole rest of the

103
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:15,570
run. Yeah. Yep. It's actually really hard to do that with the analog for some reason. Why are

104
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:30,539
you not using the D pad? I don't know because it hurts my hands. Shit. I'm so pissed. The analog

105
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:38,179
is nice. It's got like a grip on it. The buttons are like, they're like hard. They push on your

106
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:59,739
fingers. I got it. Now I'm not going to get S. Why would you ever assume you're on D pad?

107
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:12,860
Yeah, that's so much better. That is actually way easier. He's got arthritis. I mean,

108
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:51,329
maybe, maybe a little hard to tell sometimes. This dude's 70. Get an Xbox one fight pad.

109
00:37:51,329 --> 00:38:00,670
It has a bigger D pad. I do really like the Xbox controller. I think it's, I like the placement

110
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:07,949
the best, I think. Out of all the controllers, the Xbox, the, since Xbox one, I want to say

111
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:19,059
the placement's been the best for me. I prefer the PlayStation analog sticks and the PlayStation

112
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:38,900
um, trigger buttons, but I like the placement of the Xbox better. He's a real Xbox controller.

113
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:44,530
Um, I feel like the deep is the D pad worse on the original Xbox,

114
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,369
get the old one. I feel like the 360 one wasn't that great either.

115
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:37,710
All right. Once you hear, once three gulps happen, just stop moving. Oh, stop. Oh, stop it.

116
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:59,230
Good. Stop. Okay. That'd be, what's the best way to handle the guys with the forks?

117
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:44,449
Parry them? Wait, there's a parry? No, wait, that's a parry. Spoiler. You literally asked.

118
00:40:45,170 --> 00:41:11,809
I know I'm messing around. Um, did I miss this? I think I missed one of the secrets

119
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:41,090
one I got last time. Yeah, I did. That parry is so much better. The secret to the left of the first

120
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:47,730
Excalibur rat wall. Can I get it on the way back or should I just go for it now?

121
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:07,380
Now you got everything in here. You can't get it during pizza time.

122
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:48,690
Okay. I'll go back. Am I going backwards? Yeah. Okay. Um, where is it? Is it right here?

123
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:50,139
Further back. We're here. Left there. It's a slide. All right. Get over there. Maybe the night

124
00:43:51,099 --> 00:44:15,329
slide from right to left. Oh, yeah. Okay. Let's go. Wait, I didn't get this before. This is new.

125
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:40,269
Ooh, new friend. Three secrets in each level. Motoring flability in this guy. You got the secret

126
00:44:40,269 --> 00:45:07,889
that's in the room. One or two from this one. Oh, okay. So now I can go here. Yeah. I genuinely did

127
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:13,119
not understand this game at all because all of, okay, when you, when you watch a game like this,

128
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:20,059
you have no idea, no context for anything. It's just, I would always catch people screaming this

129
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:27,900
and they're just sprinting and smashing. And I was like, this game, I don't know if I want to play

130
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:40,079
this, but now I understand it. That's pretty secret in that room. All right. Well, I'm not going to

131
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:49,710
get every single secret. You know what I mean? That guy's right there. I'm definitely not going

132
00:45:49,710 --> 00:46:07,139
to get every secret. So I'm sorry if I missed them. I would talk. Yeah. I can't stop. Turn around,

133
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:48,500
please. Okay. I'm good. Okay. Yeah. I remember this. Cool. Oh, I slowed down. Okay. So that's

134
00:46:48,500 --> 00:47:04,989
two out of three. All right. Don't mess this up at the end. I'm almost at S. Um, how do I,

135
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:49,139
where's the game progress door? There we go. Pretty much where I was. One more room, right?

136
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:54,210
Go pizza time. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, I'm so bad at video games. I don't care. Take it off. Take it

137
00:48:54,210 --> 00:49:45,059
off. I got to let go of right trigger when I get near a wall. Shit. I keep forgetting about Perry.

138
00:49:45,059 --> 00:50:17,619
They haven't taught it to me yet. Oh my God. Oh my God. Guys. Hey, somebody had a pretty good tip.

139
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:24,909
Let me read it. When you're, when you're sprinting max speed, don't grab enemies. Just run through

140
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:34,769
them. Even pitchfork guys. Really come to the, what was that? What does it say? So max sprint.

141
00:50:34,769 --> 00:51:01,840
I can run through stuff. All right. Let's check that out. I really like this. This is cool. Okay.

142
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:39,250
Where's this up? Where's the tutorial? How do I get out of here? Hey, come see me. I didn't,

143
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:48,980
I was looking, I was reading chat and I didn't see where it said to go. Come to Mr. Stick to rent

144
00:51:48,980 --> 00:52:12,670
a boss gate. Where's that? You know, you could do a flying uppercut. I did know this next floor.

145
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:22,300
E, A, ah, I think I have to get a certain amount of points, right? Classic cook, the one and only.

146
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:53,440
Different outfits. Oh, just exploring. Okay. So there's two levels left on this zone. 100 bucks.

147
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:27,329
They go in here, you know, versus pepper, man. What the fuck? Okay.

148
00:53:35,150 --> 00:54:32,750
All right. This is a small window. They're grabbing the air. Yep. Oh, what? What the fuck is

149
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:57,250
happening? What do you, what do you go? Got him. Oh shit. No, I didn't. What happened? Jesus.

150
00:54:57,889 --> 00:55:19,230
Got an uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,

151
00:55:19,230 --> 00:56:04,380
I do it quick. No, I can't lose. My hand slipped off. I almost had a first try too. I get it. No,

152
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:50,510
let's go. Well, that's day forever. Damn it. I didn't want to hit him. I panicked too much when

153
00:56:50,510 --> 00:57:40,530
I, uh, all right, let's go. This game is really fucking good. Like really good. Hey, two more,

154
00:57:40,530 --> 00:58:05,219
two more. There it is. You got new clothes. Yikes. There it is. Get over here. Oh my God,

155
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:20,159
please don't do not regrow. All right. That was really fun. That was really, really fun.

156
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:50,829
You get a rating for these. Yeah, I'll take it. Uh, is S no damage? I imagine so. What do I take

157
00:58:50,829 --> 00:59:16,099
this big key? There's another rank after S. Should I open this? I still have two other zones down

158
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:26,130
there. You and Vinny both got a ranking screen for their level at the exact same time. That's funny.

159
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:56,059
Yeah, I'm not, uh, this is, I'm not, I'm going back down. So this is a different place. Let's go

160
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:18,820
here. Yeah. Pink. Cool. Who the hell even made this? Games like this just kind of come out of

161
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:43,250
nowhere. Sometimes it's like, whoa, this is really cool. I get it. Definitely going up there. Ow.

162
01:00:53,360 --> 01:01:06,400
It's a tower guy. It's been in development for ages. Really? Oh, I'm glad it's getting

163
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:20,300
attention because this is really cool. I didn't really know that much about it at all. Hey,

164
01:01:21,019 --> 01:02:04,000
combo. Okay. So how, when does it explode? His full legal name is pizza tower guy.

165
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:14,860
Okay. I just want to see how long it was. You know, there's going to be some weird

166
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:51,820
shit with that, right? Jesus. I wonder what the speed runs of this game are going to look like.

167
01:02:52,619 --> 01:03:39,409
They're probably ridiculous, right? I want to get it. Um, okay. Um, how do I do this?

168
01:03:40,289 --> 01:04:20,260
What about up there? More points. I want it. Oh, nevermind. What's this guy? Oh, that's how you do

169
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:56,340
it. Okay. Shit. Come on. Come on. One secret. Start over. Start over. Reach right. Reach right.

170
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:16,960
Reach right. Did you face game in the TV corner? What? Come on. That didn't, that had to have hit

171
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:43,519
it, right? The, what the hell? What the hell? Damn. You can cancel your sprint in midair by

172
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:52,800
attacking backwards. Ooh. Don't slide to this, to a stop on the ground a lot of time. That's way,

173
01:05:52,800 --> 01:06:20,480
that's incredibly helpful. Thank you. Yep. Boom. Rather than see in five minutes when I forget you

174
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:52,960
told me that and I don't ever do it ever again. My face games in the corner already. Yeah. That's

175
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:03,199
me. No, go down. I don't know why this is giving me so much trouble. It's giving me a lot of trouble

176
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:30,289
for some reason. There we go. Whoa. Okay. Uh, I gotta remember where that is. Goodness. Goodness.

177
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:57,650
Oh my goodness. I love the new hat, man. Oh, thanks. Trying to have a new style. What's the

178
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:26,050
right way? Did I miss something? Oh, my brain. I'm sorry. His brain.

179
01:08:38,609 --> 01:09:13,340
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I gotta, oh man. Hold on. I need to,

180
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:32,270
how do I get up there? How do I, how do I get up there? The charge jump. Yeah. It's like,

181
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:43,310
it's hard to do it from there. I don't have enough. God. Oh my goodness. I was using the

182
01:09:43,310 --> 01:10:13,100
analog. I admit it. I admit it. Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, I'm not even saying anything tonight. Oh,

183
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:43,340
fuck. Come on. What? What are you doing? Here we go. All right. Let go. I'm not going in that.

184
01:10:44,060 --> 01:11:08,720
Should I go in that? Isn't this guy weirdo? That is like the longest way possible. Where do I have

185
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:18,829
to go? Go down. Hurry. What am I, what do I do with this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

186
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:24,449
What do I do? I don't understand. I don't know what to do with that. Where, where, where is it?

187
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:29,250
Other way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Where do I throw the bomb?

188
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:34,699
The left. Why was he pointing at the bomb? Why was he pointing at the bomb?

189
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:49,569
He's not over yet. He's pointing. I always follow when he's point, point, point, point. I'm like,

190
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:55,569
oh, I got to go in the middle. He's pointing, pointing, pointing. I'm like, all right,

191
01:11:55,569 --> 01:12:25,279
he's pointing right here. I have to go right here. How do I make this work? How do I decrease it or

192
01:12:25,279 --> 01:13:08,449
increase it? Less dead zone. Save that up. That feels a little better. I can't watch you anymore.

193
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:32,079
All right. Bye. Thank you. How do I break this? Have a good night or wherever you're going to

194
01:13:32,079 --> 01:14:09,600
sleep or something. Good night. Have a good night. I know it's getting late. You're finding

195
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:20,380
entrances to secrets and ignoring them. This game is like 500 million miles per hour. I'm going to

196
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:57,899
miss a lot of shit. Did I miss everything up here? The locked door. I'm just, I'm looking for secrets.

197
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:25,100
There you go. Okay. So meeting salmon on my cheese pizza right now. Wasn't there something I could,

198
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:43,600
I could go up with this guy, right? You know what my, my issue with this, with what the game is?

199
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:50,699
No, not my issue with the game, but my issue playing it. I always, so you, you kind of,

200
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:56,380
all right, let me, let me try to describe this. When you run, you just run up everything in my

201
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:00,699
brain. I could like jump up, you know, like, Oh, I got to jump because there's a ledge here,

202
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:10,399
but you just walk up it. I got to burn that into my brain. Don't jump up edges. Just run.

203
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:23,359
You'll make it. You only have to jump if you're trying to go up a wall like that.

204
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:48,989
This game is specifically hard to control until you get used to it at the end on the first floor.

205
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:56,000
Go get used to it. Don't worry. Oh no, I, it's, it's fucking unbelievable. I can just see why.

206
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,609
Like you gotta, you're going up like a ledge. If it's a hard ledge like this jump, but if it's

207
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:19,859
a slanted edge, my brain goes, go. All right. Don't go down there yet. Anything else in here?

208
01:17:20,020 --> 01:18:29,569
No extra. Nope. Good night. Have a good night. I get some sleep.

209
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:40,180
I keep looking over and it's like, Hey, I keep reading. Hey, I'm going to bed. All right. See

210
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:45,710
you later. Good night. I'm getting at her. All right. Goodbye. Have I responded to a single other

211
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:56,699
comment in the last like 30 to 40 minutes? All right. Bye. I'm leaving forever. It's like,

212
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:08,000
all right, goodbye. I'm like, I'm concentrating too much on the game to be like, Oh, let me read

213
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:23,180
whatever else to everybody's saying. Is there a good way to get up there? Can you get through

214
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:30,560
there? Like that tight, you can never go up that way unless you do the super jump, right?

215
01:19:31,119 --> 01:20:19,569
Great. Break that. Here we go. All right. Peanut butter. Hell yeah. Oh, I remember this part was

216
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:39,069
wicked fun. Something about those screams. They're just so, they're just so imagine being the actor

217
01:20:39,149 --> 01:21:13,069
that did that. Back up there. Get that. Hold on. Wait a second. Can I? I can. Okay. Don't blow it

218
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:46,560
this time. I was going so fast too. What the heck happened? Okay. This, this part's really tricky

219
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:55,569
because you're going, you have to go so fast and stop. Yes. Yeah. Ah, slow down. So it's all right.

220
01:21:55,569 --> 01:22:08,270
Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. You're not relaxing. You're not relaxing. Relax. No,

221
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:14,239
don't relax. Get into it. Hurry up. Get, stop relaxing. Stop relaxing. All right. Go, go.

222
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:20,720
Stop relaxing. Idiot. Don't relax. Stop relaxing. So I'm relaxed and I gotta, I gotta not relax.

223
01:22:51,390 --> 01:23:45,979
Hey, what happened? Let's go. That was intense. Are you going to play another game? Um,

224
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:55,710
probably not. I'm really into this. This is cool. Just stop talking and make guttural noises.

225
01:23:56,510 --> 01:24:12,500
I'll do that for the next level. I mean, come on. We, I gotta fix this first level, right?

226
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:19,069
There ain't, there's, there's no way I'm going to let walk out of here with a B.

227
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:50,460
Are you kidding me? Lap two. Chef task for this level is to do it in under two minutes. I don't

228
01:24:50,460 --> 01:25:34,510
know if I'm going to do that. I just don't want to be. Ooh, nice. Easy. Oh, it only activates when

229
01:25:34,590 --> 01:26:01,340
pizza time is on. Okay. Already had a B. 24 hit combo. Um, I feel like there's something over here.

230
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:43,180
No, start. No, I keep hitting Y. You know what else is doing? It's me too.

231
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:48,609
I almost hold Y instinctively because of any platform game, especially Mario.

232
01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:53,810
Y is kind of hold it to go faster. My brain's like, yeah, you have to do that.

233
01:26:54,449 --> 01:27:59,600
Probably something back here. It's going so fast. Oh shit. I didn't. Oh, sorry. Where's the door for

234
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:13,899
this guy? First time viewer. Don't you dare read this. I fucked it up. I'm sorry. I fucked it up.

235
01:28:14,619 --> 01:28:17,979
Just, just go, just leave. You know what I mean? Like I'm, I've ruined, I've ruined it all for you.

236
01:28:17,979 --> 01:29:23,470
Just like, sorry. Let's go. Just go. Oh my God. Doing that. How am I still a B?

237
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:48,189
B. Oh, no chance. I do this now. Maybe I got to concentrate. God damn it. It's so hard to fit

238
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:53,970
into those little fucking tiny corridors. See like, yeah, like jump it and you go the other way.

239
01:29:53,970 --> 01:30:28,850
Fuck. God damn it. Oh, no. Oh, I fucking ruined it. Yeah. It's just like fitting and I might,

240
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:41,920
go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I got it. I got it. No, so hard.

241
01:30:47,470 --> 01:31:03,250
Damn it. This game is really fucking hard, but it's so fun. I keep Super Mario myself too,

242
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,369
when it's just like, okay, here we go. And I, I'm going to run up the thing.

243
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:25,220
Sprint cancel. I know, but it's like my, it's, you got to lock it in to memory. It's just so hard to

244
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:52,720
burn it in. Do you want to tell you where secrets are? Um, if I very, very blatantly

245
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:57,659
miss one that I opened or something, then yeah, but it's okay. I don't need to get them all.

246
01:31:57,659 --> 01:32:10,560
This game reminds me of something and I'm trying to figure out what it is.

247
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,880
And I had similar trouble with that other game too. And I don't remember what it is. It's like,

248
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,840
when you stick to the walls and like, when it, so for, when I jumped, those that have not played

249
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:27,500
this, I just go up the wall. Yup. I'm not pressing up or anything. It's like a completely different,

250
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,159
way to see what it did. See my brain said jump, because you have to jump over this

251
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:39,229
super meat point. No, I think you still have to hold the button. I think you played in your

252
01:32:49,390 --> 01:33:00,779
road runner on SNES. Oh my God, dude, you got it right. How did you do that? How did you actually

253
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:27,220
do that? That's truly unbelievable. Cause I think that's correct. Wow. Yeah. Road runner on SNES.

254
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:36,159
I remember, and I remember biting my controller at certain parts of that game because like the,

255
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:42,829
say the control scheme and it was, it was, it was a similar control scheme and this control scheme is

256
01:33:42,829 --> 01:34:04,510
tight. It's very, it's awesome. It's so fluid. Yeah. I had huge teeth marks on my controller,

257
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:19,779
but where's this guy's door? This guy usually has a room, right? I don't want to activate it

258
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:44,779
until I go there. Well, and I didn't, this is okay. See, it's because I'm not just,

259
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:58,220
Oh, see that I'm jumping too early. Come on, Gwen, get, get it together. See, that's what I

260
01:34:58,220 --> 01:36:12,529
should be doing. Come on, Gwen, get it together. How's that not going to pass? Fuck you. Is that

261
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:32,210
it? Okay. I got a, that's all I care about. I'll never get ass. Didn't do lap two. Bye.

262
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:40,960
Why is everybody saying bye today? It's like a meme. I don't know about. All right. Bye. See

263
01:36:40,960 --> 01:37:00,689
you later. So I have to do, I got one more area down here, right? You keep, you keep responding

264
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:36,060
to them. Did that already? That was so fun. Did that one up here, right? Whoa. Oh yes. That's

265
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:44,689
right. You know that your full name is Pepino spaghetti. That's unfortunate. That's like not

266
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:50,640
a full name. I feel like if your name is Pepino spaghetti,

267
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,840
I feel like that people will be like, wow, that's a pretty unique name.

268
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:24,449
Pepino spaghetti. All right. I'm ready. I'm not going to mess it up. Back up some weird shit in

269
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:50,000
here. Right? Why is this like this? I keep forgetting. Don't do that. Forgetting. There's that

270
01:38:50,000 --> 01:39:25,899
and go that way. Right? Does anybody know what that scream is called? Does anybody know what that is?

271
01:39:25,899 --> 01:39:44,689
That's got a very specific name, doesn't it? All right. Well, I got it. Really?

272
01:39:48,449 --> 01:40:13,069
Tom, it's Mel Blanc. It's Mel Blanc. Really? That's Mel Blanc. What is it? What do you call it?

273
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:45,140
Mel Blanc scream or Tom and Jerry? Is that, I don't think that's Wilhelm. Yeah, that's not

274
01:40:45,140 --> 01:41:41,859
Wilhelm. Damn it. This is going to be so hard to do this on the way back. I can get in there.

275
01:41:41,939 --> 01:42:16,689
How do I get in there? You're going to get probably from down. Okay. I go like this.

276
01:42:16,689 --> 01:42:49,539
Huh? What? I'm under. Uh, yeah, you're right. You're right. Thank you. Okay.

277
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:28,500
Did I get everything? I think so. You guys doing a race? What are you guys doing? Why wasn't I

278
01:43:28,500 --> 01:44:39,550
invited? Jesus. I don't have that guy. Harry button. I haven't pressed at all. And I missed it.

279
01:44:40,270 --> 01:47:00,989
All right. Down. Oh, come on. Peppino. Oh, come on. Peppino. Did my microphone go like, oh yeah.

280
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:28,989
No, Pino. That was a lot cleaner on back. All right. Got a hundred bucks. I can do area two now,

281
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:38,000
right? I mean, my brain does this thing where like my brain, like it does this sort of thing.

282
01:47:38,960 --> 01:48:09,060
I was, I was poking fun at myself. Okay. So we got this place. What's going on with these two?

283
01:48:09,939 --> 01:48:26,180
Know that you can walk and parry. Yeah. Ooh, this one looks fun. All right. I'm doing this one.

284
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:30,899
It's like a banyan. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. Thanks for asking. Hope you're doing

285
01:48:30,899 --> 01:49:09,779
good too. I love the way this level looks. Good stream. Bye. He keeps reading them. All right. Bye.

286
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:38,800
Learn to parry at the very beginning. Hollywood edge sound effects library from the cartoon

287
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:43,520
tracks volume two. The track name is called funny man yells in medium high pitched tone.

288
01:49:44,319 --> 01:50:10,750
Okay. Good to know. Can I go through that way? It's not the Pino's though. It's close,

289
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:26,609
but it's not right. Really? Hold on. I want to look this up. I'll do it edge.

290
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:58,670
Dream. I just type it. What's it called? Funny man yells. Is this it? I'm going to turn it down.

291
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:26,350
It gets really loud. Dude, this is orphan of costs. This is orphan of costs. What the fuck?

292
01:51:28,029 --> 01:51:54,050
No, it's not. That's absolutely orphan of costs. There's no way it's not. Especially this first

293
01:51:54,050 --> 01:53:00,180
one. That's unbelievable. Orphan costs yell. It's definitely it. I can't. All right. I'm going

294
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:15,310
back to play this game. The coolest thing about finding, thinking, hearing stuff like that,

295
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:22,819
you wouldn't believe how much, how many video game sounds are just everywhere shared just from

296
01:53:22,819 --> 01:53:30,619
different libraries. Wait, orphan isolated screams. I mean, we're here. We're doing this right now,

297
01:53:30,619 --> 01:53:46,640
just for another minute. Yeah, that's, there's no, it's just filters on it. There's a filter on it

298
01:53:46,640 --> 01:54:00,270
and that's it. I love that. That's so funny. Do that impression. I would blow up my vocal chords.

299
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:23,949
Yeah, there's a little bit of reverb on it. Okay, let's go. Now add farting to it. No, dude. Come

300
01:54:23,949 --> 01:54:41,710
on. It's one of those moments where, okay, you know, the TF2 door opening sound effect and you

301
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:46,670
hear it in another game or in a TV show or something and you just, you brain goes,

302
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:52,579
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Somebody's open the spawn door. It was one of those moments.

303
01:55:01,699 --> 01:55:32,779
You're good. I can't even play the game anymore. Now it's over. I can't even play. I can't do that.

304
01:55:32,779 --> 01:55:55,489
Oh, get out of the way. Double jump. Oh, oh, wait, wait, no, this is, this is a good thing. Okay.

305
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:47,329
Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. All right. I don't want to take it off yet. Look, there's a place over

306
01:56:47,329 --> 01:57:26,239
there. Oh, there's a place over there. Oh, that hurts. I'm going to get destroyed on the run back

307
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:45,470
part. I haven't strung much together in this one. Hey, I'm staying. Hello. You can stay or leave.

308
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:52,880
It's up to you. If you want to go, I'll see you later. Or maybe not. If you want to go and

309
01:57:54,500 --> 01:58:01,069
get dinner or food or snack or sleep, it's up to you. Not tell you what to do with your time.

310
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:16,609
I can rage at what just happened. And hey, time is a precious thing.

311
01:58:17,649 --> 01:58:31,619
So make sure you use it the way you want to. Time is a precious resource.

312
01:58:44,060 --> 01:59:14,850
Who is hitting me? I'm, I've hit, you know, more than 10 times now in like 10 hundred times, dude.

313
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:33,819
Can you, I didn't know if there's something over there I could do. There's so many secrets in this

314
01:59:33,819 --> 02:00:09,569
game. I'm trying to find them. Are you kidding me? All right. Let's bring something together.

315
02:00:09,569 --> 02:00:59,470
This is hard to do. Shaking my head. Hurry up. Oh, no. Get it together. I'll be all right.

316
02:01:39,779 --> 02:02:01,920
All right. Don't don't don't don't. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This stuff I can do here, right?

317
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:13,789
No, no. Okay. We're good. No, I don't have the janitor. Sorry. Right. Oh, second lap.

318
02:02:14,989 --> 02:02:26,289
That was kind of, that was a little crap. It's okay though. I'm just topping too. That's kind of

319
02:02:26,289 --> 02:03:13,010
crap. That's terrifying. Holy shit. Oh, I can buy it. Oh, interesting. Is one of these a bar

320
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:30,029
saloon? Oh, this one's gonna be cool. Make a weird noise. Yeah, sure. Of course I will.

321
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:37,390
I'm the weird noise guy. That's what I do here. Tell your friends.

322
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:53,170
I got to parry this. I missed it. You can do it backwards. All right. Cool.

323
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:21,949
Don't go. What are you doing? What's this thing? Lap two room. Oh, okay. Cool.

324
02:04:22,670 --> 02:05:15,579
Hmm. I thought I went all over the water. Apparently not. Cool. Just got back to the bathroom.

325
02:05:15,579 --> 02:05:23,970
I did. I missed any funny or weird noises or anything. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm under my contract.

326
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:56,140
I can only do two an hour. So I can't go like, dude. What is the, what do I do about this? Oh,

327
02:06:08,109 --> 02:06:11,869
you lost the race. I didn't know there was a race even going on.

328
02:06:12,510 --> 02:07:20,880
My softlock. Get up there. There we go. I don't understand what's going on here. Um,

329
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:32,699
it is a little confusing. It's very fast. It's very high, uh, off pain. Is that correct? High

330
02:07:32,699 --> 02:08:10,369
skill. High fast. Very quick. Very speed runnable. Is this a secret right here? I bet I could beat

331
02:08:10,369 --> 02:08:35,949
you in a hair growing competition. Um, you have long hair because you've already won pizza. Oh,

332
02:08:37,310 --> 02:09:53,600
I won. Yikes. No, stop jumping. No, no. I gotta get all the cards, right? Come on.

333
02:09:53,600 --> 02:10:37,140
Can't just not get them. Oh shit. Oh, I got it. All right. That's pretty clean. Pretty clean.

334
02:10:37,699 --> 02:11:15,500
I don't have any complaints. Okay. I didn't screw this all up. Did I?

335
02:11:35,229 --> 02:11:39,039
Hmm. I want that. There you go.

336
02:11:48,619 --> 02:12:09,810
Is music too low? Um, I can turn it. I probably turn it down a little.

337
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:31,789
That's far better. How's that on the wall? On the wall. Secret in the last room. You mean

338
02:12:31,789 --> 02:13:07,359
we're on the wall, right side or left side? There's like three rooms back. Um, but right here,

339
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:44,609
right there. As I can get it. Hey, yes, I can. Oh man. I got it. All right. Now I don't want to,

340
02:13:44,609 --> 02:13:51,789
I gotta, I don't blow on it this time. You know what I mean? Don't blow it. I got a,

341
02:13:51,789 --> 02:14:05,810
this is going pretty well. Don't blow it. Oh, I don't even need to do this anymore.

342
02:14:06,449 --> 02:15:52,340
Is that an emote? Hmm. What happened to me? I got, I got a chef. No lap two. I'm not confident

343
02:15:52,420 --> 02:16:12,770
enough to do lap two. On a second run through maybe. I missed one. Oh, you have to beat it

344
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:27,300
one time anyways. Okay. That's good to know. Do you use money for anything else or is it just

345
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:53,709
the portals? This is a boss. Let's see it. Vigilante. Is this guy made out of butter?

346
02:16:57,329 --> 02:17:51,969
Gun. I can probably parry those, right? What is going on? Oh, it's hitting. Okay. It's splash

347
02:17:51,969 --> 02:18:34,129
damage. Oh goodness. Fuck. You cannot parry them. Okay. I was under the impression that I could.

348
02:18:40,899 --> 02:19:32,750
You can. Why didn't it work? Really? It looked like I did a parry it. Yeah. Okay. Um, what? Well,

349
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:39,819
I had to know. I didn't know it was going to be like countdown or something. I didn't think it was,

350
02:19:39,819 --> 02:19:50,719
I didn't want to fault. I thought I was, I didn't, I guess it's a draw, but I thought it was whatever.

351
02:19:50,719 --> 02:21:13,379
I'm going to do a better job anyways. Restart it. Stupid. All right. We're good. What is that?

352
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:20,430
Hold on. Why can I reload it? It's weird. Let's just do. Oh, it's like a super shot. All right.

353
02:21:21,149 --> 02:22:24,540
Shit. All right. Don't get too fancy with it. No reason to even do that. I jumped over it.

354
02:22:24,540 --> 02:22:55,549
You dumb mother fucker. I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

355
02:23:03,420 --> 02:24:50,209
That one doesn't count. We're going to do it a different way. I know it's just itchy. Shut up.

356
02:24:50,209 --> 02:25:02,750
I forgot he could even do that stupid ass move. What? Um, it's awful. I'm going to restart. I

357
02:25:02,750 --> 02:26:55,950
don't care. Change this immediately. Immediately. I can't believe he does it like five fucking six

358
02:26:55,950 --> 02:28:04,510
fucking five fucking six fucking times. What's happening? What's going on? I think that was

359
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:38,530
better. You have to jump those ones. God damn it. It's no, it's going to be a last try. I'm addicted.

360
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:50,219
I'm sorry. I just am. How many hits is a so I can know it's going to make me laugh at every time,

361
02:28:50,219 --> 02:29:57,739
dude. Everything spawned at the same time. That was unfortunate. You just went over your contracted

362
02:29:57,739 --> 02:30:29,149
limit of funny noises. Let me read chat and get hurt. Get this shit off. I wouldn't. What a character

363
02:30:29,149 --> 02:30:56,819
am I? Oh my God. It's over, dude. Oh, you, there's no way you didn't die. I shot you a hundred fucking

364
02:30:56,819 --> 02:31:52,399
times again. I need to get hit one less time. So was it two, three? I got screwed there. I got,

365
02:31:52,399 --> 02:33:37,579
I took, I took a hit there that I should never have taken. Oh my God. I was, I didn't have it.

366
02:33:37,579 --> 02:34:16,219
Quiet. I think I lost it again. Dude, when he drops a cow, a cardboard person, that it's just,

367
02:34:16,219 --> 02:34:27,020
it's just, you're going to get hit. I think I got it though. Didn't I? That's definitely a right.

368
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:55,649
Two hits, three hits. That's gotta be a, is S no damage? That's so hard. That's probably so hard

369
02:34:55,649 --> 02:35:00,209
to do. Let me just, for all you gamers out there, people that are watching wherever you are,

370
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:15,950
if you're able to just kind of grab this and do it and beat it in, get S on every level and shit,

371
02:35:17,629 --> 02:35:24,590
man, you are, you're just, you're, you're good. You're just, you're eyesight,

372
02:35:25,819 --> 02:35:36,260
your coordination, your, your eyesight in floor three. Oh, we're not done with floor two.

373
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:53,010
Like your visual, hold on. I'm going to go ahead and talk about something that I've been telling

374
02:35:53,010 --> 02:35:59,219
others who know about this place of worship that you did this. Well, we're down from your pizzeria

375
02:35:59,219 --> 02:36:04,100
and we're down from this tower. There are customers and they want to see one of these things.

376
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:09,540
So I got a friend. He went down one of these floors and this guy came up next to me.

377
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,979
The idea was, why is that when you're in the upper part of the tower?

378
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:18,500
There's the pizza face character and then there's this man from your previous life leading the way.

379
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:24,819
There's a pizza in your tower with all this information. What is this even trying to say?

380
02:36:26,579 --> 02:36:52,700
Talk about these things? What does that even mean? B, eh, it's all right. S rank is one to

381
02:36:52,700 --> 02:37:54,850
two hits. P rank is no hits. It sounds like the clay fighter theme song. Pizza Mark. Why am I so

382
02:37:54,850 --> 02:38:15,629
bad at this game? Bro, I have a rank in almost every level. What are you on about? A means

383
02:38:15,629 --> 02:38:21,440
excellent. No, I'm not going to get P in every level. I'm not going to get S in every single level.

384
02:38:22,159 --> 02:38:58,700
How do you ground pound with it being turned off and down? You don't? Oh, you have to bind it.

385
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:13,950
So it's not like a button combination. I have to have it on. I thought it would be like down and

386
02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:47,569
X or something. Oh, wait, is it? No. OK. Oh, wait. I had to run and dive. Yeah. Sorry.

387
02:39:48,290 --> 02:40:05,469
Didn't realize that was going to happen. Can I reset it now? Oh, you can bind to buttons. OK,

388
02:40:05,469 --> 02:40:15,520
that's better. Yeah, that's way easier for me. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, should it be

389
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:29,889
a circle left trigger? Maybe. All right. So that's left trigger. That's circle.

390
02:40:36,430 --> 02:40:50,420
I'm going to flip those because that's weird to do that jump and left trigger is better.

391
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:15,680
All right. Just getting used to it. I have to relearn everything. I have to put it back.

392
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:28,129
I have to put it back. It's fucking with me. It's been too. You know what? The big mistake

393
02:41:28,129 --> 02:41:38,299
was I spent way too long with it. Not on. That was a change. I should have. I was supposed to

394
02:41:38,299 --> 02:42:22,829
make two and a half hours ago. You only tried it for 10 seconds. Yeah, but I'm in like, I mean,

395
02:42:22,829 --> 02:42:28,590
I'm pretty far into this first part of the game. I feel like this would be a bad place to do it.

396
02:42:28,590 --> 02:43:17,760
I should do it on one of the earlier levels. Do I need to go? I have to be breathing fire,

397
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:52,479
don't I? Wait, hold on. Why does it keep spawning these? Where did I get the fire? Oh, OK. Well,

398
02:43:52,479 --> 02:44:32,610
what the fuck? I did not know I was supposed to do that. Ten hit combo. Why did it stop?

399
02:44:33,170 --> 02:45:53,489
I should get these down here. Thank you. No, damn it. Didn't mean to press that.

400
02:45:53,489 --> 02:46:33,889
I let me try to go back over here and whatever aliens. Oh, my goodness. I feel like I'm

401
02:46:33,889 --> 02:46:50,899
a human pinball in this game. You just kind of like bounce over everything. Here comes an alien

402
02:46:50,899 --> 02:46:58,989
rant. And by the way, when aliens actually finally fucking land, they're going to take a bite of

403
02:46:58,989 --> 02:47:19,469
pizza. Kidding. All right. I'm going to get my ass kicked on this level. Goodness, I don't know.

404
02:47:19,469 --> 02:48:05,700
Which way? God, am I even going the right direction? I have no idea. I didn't want to go in here.

405
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:33,889
Not that way. You know, also with this game, too, I think, oh, you when you memorize the level,

406
02:48:34,450 --> 02:48:40,209
which is good luck, I ain't ever going to do that. That's into the crazy routes. This is going to be

407
02:48:40,209 --> 02:49:01,700
C rank, but whatever. Oh, OK. The speed runs for this game are nuts. I'd love to watch them,

408
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:10,780
but I'd like to beat it first. That's going to make me feel bad if I watch a speed run,

409
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:29,520
because like while I go like this, oh, that person already beat three levels. So what's left?

410
02:49:30,079 --> 02:49:56,639
Did I do all the third second level? Is there one more? Howdy, welcome to floor two.

411
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:19,459
Thirty one out of ninety five, eight out of fifty seven, two out of nineteen waste yard.

412
02:50:19,459 --> 02:50:52,739
All right, let's make this one clean, please. It's going to be this is going to be clean.

413
02:50:52,739 --> 02:51:51,629
What the fuck? My God. Whoa. Move through. OK, that's cool. That's the best way to get in there

414
02:51:51,629 --> 02:52:32,639
like that. All right, let's get this right. What does this do? Just go fast. OK. Oh, it's a timer.

415
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:59,579
I get it. I hope that was all right. What are you doing over there? Where did you come from?

416
02:53:12,079 --> 02:53:52,690
Hurry. Oh, better. Those ghost pepper. Oh, what is the new hottest pepper in the world?

417
02:53:54,319 --> 02:53:58,479
They keep changing it, right? They keep going into science experiments and oh, this is the

418
02:53:58,479 --> 02:54:05,760
Scorpion Ultra HD, like 4K, 1080p pepper. What is it now? They change it every few years.

419
02:54:06,639 --> 02:54:23,420
Carolina Reaper is still the number one. Why? Why?

420
02:54:41,549 --> 02:55:09,500
Here. Get in there. This guy's fucking terrifying. Get away from me. Come on, man.

421
02:55:33,500 --> 02:56:16,829
Oh, fuck. I thought it was a way to go down, but it's not. Holy shit. This game is crap.

422
02:56:16,829 --> 02:56:56,420
Oh, hi. Awesome. Something called Pepper X. Pepper that is most recognized as the

423
02:56:56,420 --> 02:57:06,180
spiciest pepper in the world is known as Pepper X. Pepper X was created by none other than Ed

424
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:13,340
Curry, the creator of the Carolina Reaper. He created Pepper X by cross breeding various

425
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:18,850
chili pepper types to create a heat that is hotter than the Carolina Reaper. But if this is true,

426
02:57:18,850 --> 02:57:24,590
why is the Carolina Reaper more famous than Pepper X? That's because Pepper X is yet to be

427
02:57:24,590 --> 02:57:29,889
confirmed as the world's hottest pepper by the Guinness Book of World Records. Of the time being,

428
02:57:29,889 --> 02:57:51,040
Carolina Reaper, yeah, whatever. Pepper X. Oh, I got to tweet out my sponsor tweet for Wild Hearts.

429
02:57:51,040 --> 02:58:10,479
This floor is done? Yeah. Is there anything? Do I want? Yeah, B is okay for me. I'm not really

430
02:58:10,479 --> 02:58:18,270
a gamer. It's okay. It's been a little bit. No, it was supposed to be within like

431
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:29,629
two days of doing the stream. So it's okay. Vacation Resort. Oh, they're happy now. They're

432
02:58:29,629 --> 02:58:47,040
friends. Holly and I have been playing Wild Hearts and I recorded something that I would like to show

433
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:52,370
at some point tonight. And I don't even know if it's that funny, but I feel like it was.

434
02:58:55,040 --> 02:59:00,510
It was the hardest. I've laughed in like two or three weeks at some point. How about right now?

435
02:59:01,069 --> 02:59:06,719
I'm going to do it right now. Show it now. I have, I like, I prepared it because I was like,

436
02:59:06,719 --> 02:59:16,100
I probably want to show this. I'll do it in a little bit after this mini golf.

437
02:59:22,899 --> 03:00:33,579
I got it. Nothing. What? These count as hits? No. What? Hey, I got it. Nice. Okay. Cool.

438
03:00:33,579 --> 03:01:18,110
This level is awesome. I like this. Fuck you. Can I aim it differently or can I only just aim

439
03:01:18,110 --> 03:01:51,469
it up or straight? Stop. All right. That's, I don't get that, but it's hard, but whatever.

440
03:01:51,469 --> 03:02:39,389
All right. Two more shots. Shit in my pants. Got it. Go get sucked into it. 15. R15. That's

441
03:02:39,389 --> 03:02:59,700
kind of high. Stop. No, this is actually kind of sucks. What's the speed run on this look like?

442
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:21,629
I wonder. Can I not get hit by this? That would be fantastic. It wasn't as bad as I thought.

443
03:03:34,780 --> 03:03:49,360
You just run into the ball at top speed. Interesting. How do I go backwards with this?

444
03:03:50,000 --> 03:04:05,229
I wonder if I can. No. I'm kind of scared to do this. I'm going to run into the ball. I'm

445
03:04:05,229 --> 03:04:53,069
just going to do like three hits on it. Stop. I get plenty of time. Suck them up. Yes. Present.

446
03:04:54,930 --> 03:05:35,540
That was nice. Soda course. You know, he made it. Don't bounce back here, please. Thank you.

447
03:05:36,340 --> 03:06:33,469
Appreciate it. Nice toss. Remember Boogerman? I do remember Boogerman. I've been playing it once

448
03:06:33,469 --> 03:06:36,909
and I think I got lost on the first level I think when I was younger and just quit.

449
03:06:37,549 --> 03:07:32,799
I never played it ever again. Backwards. How do I open that? Let's go. 15. All right. Just walk

450
03:07:32,799 --> 03:07:39,889
over there. You'll be good. I think my microwave keeps going off. Yeah, that is kind of a microwave

451
03:07:39,889 --> 03:08:08,100
sound, isn't it? Wait. Oh, hold on. These things are freaking me out. Let me get the right angle

452
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:57,409
here. What the hell even is this level? I didn't even know that. I didn't know that was a ladder.

453
03:08:57,409 --> 03:09:30,450
All right. Get over there. All right. Stop throwing me. And I know you fucking little shit.

454
03:09:30,450 --> 03:10:17,520
Get over here. 15. Shit. 14. Oh no. He's going all the way back. Thank God. Thank goodness.

455
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:48,620
Final course. It's pizza time already. It's pizza time already. It is. Uh oh. Where's the,

456
03:10:50,180 --> 03:11:21,059
um, what's, where do I go? Down? Present. I want it. I don't actually have to get this. Do I?

457
03:11:23,200 --> 03:12:02,540
No way, dude. I have to actually get this in. Okay. Oh, get us in there.

458
03:12:11,379 --> 03:12:52,930
Okay. No, no, no. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Stop. Nope. I don't have the key.

459
03:12:53,489 --> 03:13:51,120
Let's go. Let's go. That one was very, very strange. It was fun though. I got all the

460
03:13:51,120 --> 03:14:00,770
toppings. Good. All right. I need to, yeah, let's do two things here. Let me just,

461
03:14:00,770 --> 03:14:07,520
I need to tweak my sponsor thing. You want to watch this video? All right. Let me give you the

462
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:13,010
context of this video. Is that, is actually, I don't know. I don't think it's a scripted event.

463
03:14:13,010 --> 03:14:19,420
I think it just kind of happened, but he was just doing it for me for some reason.

464
03:14:20,059 --> 03:14:24,319
I thought it was the funniest thing ever. All right. Let's watch it. It's like a,

465
03:14:24,319 --> 03:14:39,309
it's 10, 15 seconds long. So in the game, just like in obviously like monster hunter and stuff,

466
03:14:39,309 --> 03:14:50,690
the monsters sometimes will be annoyed with each other. And these two monsters like got kind of

467
03:14:50,690 --> 03:14:59,200
in each other's face and they, something very funny happened. I don't know if it happens all

468
03:14:59,200 --> 03:15:06,610
the time, but I'm going to play it. So here you go. So this is me and Holly are playing.

469
03:15:06,610 --> 03:15:12,909
I've been, we've been playing this game off stream. I've been playing it. I think it's fun.

470
03:15:12,909 --> 03:15:15,069
I want to watch it a couple of times, but I want to break it down a little bit

471
03:15:15,069 --> 03:15:21,469
because I think it's funny. So this is a lava gorilla on the right here.

472
03:15:22,430 --> 03:15:29,700
That's the quest was to find the lava back. Okay. Found it. But do you remember that little dolphin

473
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:38,379
that zoomed in? Cause I want you to be able to see it better. So that little dolphin squirrel from

474
03:15:41,010 --> 03:15:48,459
when me and Vinny were playing it, if this is scripted, it's hilarious. I'm playing,

475
03:15:48,459 --> 03:15:51,920
I'm playing on a series S by the way, if you're wondering where it looks bad,

476
03:15:51,920 --> 03:15:59,569
it doesn't look bad. It just zoomed in and it's on a series S and I'm recording.

477
03:15:59,569 --> 03:16:07,010
I like pulled it from the Xbox, which I think records at who fucking knows probably like

478
03:16:07,010 --> 03:16:14,100
not even 720 P, but all you need to see is this. So these two monsters, they get, here we come.

479
03:16:17,420 --> 03:16:23,790
They're annoyed with each other. He's like, I'm going to spray and then they just kind of sit here

480
03:16:23,790 --> 03:16:29,360
and it's like, okay, what's going to happen here? I guess it gets really, maybe they're going to fight

481
03:16:29,360 --> 03:16:49,569
and then watch what happens. He fucking destroys him. He embarrasses him so much to a point where

482
03:16:49,569 --> 03:17:03,180
he just gets up and leaves. He's like, I'm out of here. The funniest part of this whole clip is

483
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:10,780
the fact that, so you, you go up, you're yelling at each other's faces, right? You get up on that

484
03:17:10,780 --> 03:17:20,700
little podium, you're ready for a fight and then he looks behind him. He's like, why is he looking

485
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:36,270
behind him? And then finally he realizes right here. Oh shit. He does this like, oh, it's just

486
03:17:36,270 --> 03:17:50,479
perfect. Why would you turn your back? And then he just grabs him by the tail, he throws him.

487
03:17:51,549 --> 03:18:08,340
It was so sad. Look up this turf war video. I just thought it was really funny. I just wanted to

488
03:18:08,340 --> 03:18:13,840
show it. I don't think it's scripted. I think that the monsters can literally just like Monster Hunter

489
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:22,350
can walk into each other and attack each other. It's at the level of this. Oh, that's so funny then.

490
03:18:28,239 --> 03:18:31,200
Is it scripted? Well, if it's scripted, it's fucking funny because

491
03:18:35,780 --> 03:18:50,379
he just gets decimated. It's technically scripted. Yeah, but it's still funny. I like it. That's my

492
03:18:50,379 --> 03:19:10,530
video. You're easily amused. I think that's a good thing. How long had the fight been going before

493
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:20,590
that? They just, there was nothing. They just walked into each other and then he ran away.

494
03:19:20,590 --> 03:19:26,860
We were looking for that monster and they have these paths and that one just happened to be

495
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:35,090
there. That was the only thing that happened. They found each other and then they ran away.

496
03:19:35,090 --> 03:19:42,190
Okay. I'm going to do one more of it. I said video, one more level and I'm probably going to

497
03:19:42,190 --> 03:20:01,299
call it. I'm kind of hungry. That poor little squirrel. Do the forest level. Is it in here?

498
03:20:01,299 --> 03:20:35,379
I walked into here accidentally. 200. How many floors are there? Five? Cool. All right. Let's

499
03:20:35,379 --> 03:21:29,520
do it. Ooh. Can I make it through that? I wonder, is this going to help me later?

500
03:21:29,520 --> 03:22:28,159
Is there anything else I can do? Oh, I had it. Shit. Read out the pig video. Uh, yep. Hello.

501
03:22:28,159 --> 03:22:53,870
Thank you for the reminder. Gustavo and brick tutorial. I guess we got to do this move faster

502
03:22:53,870 --> 03:23:13,360
and destroy metal blocks. Yeah. Kick the rat. Whoa. The air to do a double jump and cancel out of the

503
03:23:14,479 --> 03:23:51,280
cancel out of it with another move. This is fun. This is cute. Is there anything else that I should

504
03:23:51,280 --> 03:24:15,709
do? Or is that it? I like the kick. I'm trying to read. Leave me alone. Double jump can also

505
03:24:15,709 --> 03:24:25,729
destroy metal blocks underneath while doing the double jump hold while holding in the direction

506
03:24:25,729 --> 03:25:05,309
of a wall. Let's go. That's cool. I like that. So these face blocks, I imagine you probably unlock

507
03:25:05,309 --> 03:25:09,549
it later. And it's like a Metroid, uh, you know, mania thing where you kept to come back and do

508
03:25:09,549 --> 03:25:23,040
it all again, right? No. Oh, wait, it's no, right. They disappear for some reason. I thought maybe

509
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:45,790
eventually you could open it all. That's right. That's right. Yep. Goodness. That was cool.

510
03:25:46,510 --> 03:26:54,940
Checking for secret. This guy's problem. The delivery. Oh, shit. I got it. Give me those

511
03:26:55,899 --> 03:28:28,639
more toppings. Um, that bounce, right? Hurry. No, come here. You can do it. Smoking.

512
03:28:28,639 --> 03:29:13,700
I said, am I too high to watch this? Um, be careful, man. All right. I feel like I'm getting

513
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:52,219
close. Right. Right. That the soundtrack might be my favorite part of the whole game. It's just so,

514
03:29:52,219 --> 03:30:14,639
it's very pleasant. I don't know where the door was for this guy. I'm not sure I even saw it yet.

515
03:30:14,639 --> 03:30:57,819
Oh, come on. My delivery. Got to get it. Hurry. No. No. Oh my goodness. Oh, come on. Just go.

516
03:30:59,979 --> 03:31:50,459
Thank goodness. Let's just go. Final delivery too. And does anybody do like a hundred percent

517
03:31:50,459 --> 03:31:54,620
get a hundred percent of the clocks like that would be unbelievably difficult.

518
03:31:55,579 --> 03:32:40,670
Just that's, that's so much stress. Stop bouncing around. Back to that guy. Oh,

519
03:32:42,829 --> 03:33:17,090
just go. I got an A already. Just go sneak down there. What are you doing, man? Nice. Sorry. I'm

520
03:33:17,090 --> 03:33:24,129
not really talking. My brain needs like 1000% power to play this. It's really fun though. I

521
03:33:24,129 --> 03:33:31,579
really like it. Oh, but I have to see what the boss is. We're not done. I need to tweet out that

522
03:33:31,579 --> 03:33:53,899
thing. All right. Okay. Two attempts at the boss and that's it. Two attempts at the boss and I'm

523
03:33:53,899 --> 03:34:18,819
done. You're streaming a stream. You're going to tweet sponsored content at 10 p.m. Pacific.

524
03:34:18,819 --> 03:34:43,569
Uh-oh. Rival Pizzeria. Okay. I'm just, I'm playing like an idiot here. Oh, it's supposed to be the

525
03:34:44,290 --> 03:35:05,600
pizza hut. All right. What was that thing's name? The Noid. Yeah. Don't do that. Did I pick them up?

526
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:12,270
Okay. You can't pick up the bombs. Just restart. Why not? That doesn't count as an attempt to have

527
03:35:12,270 --> 03:36:41,809
to die. Ow. All right. Base two. Jeez. What's the opportunity? Right there. Jesus. Oh, I thought

528
03:36:41,809 --> 03:37:21,860
that was a little guy. Damn it. Oh, come on, man. All right. One more. One more. That was it. I had

529
03:37:21,860 --> 03:38:53,229
it. He throws the skateboard out. Do your thing. Dick. Dick. Oh, you dick. Okay. Oh, I thought he

530
03:38:53,229 --> 03:40:05,680
was going to go up. Oh, that bait. So annoying. Stop. Fine. I can do that too. I'm going to get an

531
03:40:05,680 --> 03:40:51,620
F. Whatever. I'm going to pass it. It's probably a C. Is the lowest grade a C? He is lower. Okay.

532
03:40:51,620 --> 03:41:05,549
That's a good place to stop, I think. Saves automatically, I imagine, right? Well, I'm

533
03:41:05,549 --> 03:41:11,469
definitely going to finish this game. You will see it again. 100%. This game is really fun.

534
03:41:12,270 --> 03:41:17,739
We're not really talking that much, especially the last like hour or two. I was gaming hard,

535
03:41:17,739 --> 03:41:28,190
but it's really fun. I really like it. All right. So the next time I will be live,

536
03:41:28,190 --> 03:41:42,739
probably one more time this week, maybe on Friday, but after Friday, there's a lot. There's a lot of

537
03:41:42,739 --> 03:41:51,979
work to finish up for grotto piece and then come this next week and have a lot of stuff to share.

538
03:41:53,069 --> 03:42:02,000
All very exciting. I'm really, really excited for it. Hopefully it's, uh, hopefully it's been

539
03:42:02,000 --> 03:42:12,420
worth the wait. I think it has. It looks fucking unbelievable. It looks so fucking cool. I'm really,

540
03:42:12,420 --> 03:42:32,350
really happy with it. And frog detective too. You don't want to miss frog detective. I don't

541
03:42:32,350 --> 03:42:36,989
want to over hype it because obviously that's always not a good thing to do. That's why I don't

542
03:42:36,989 --> 03:42:43,329
talk that much about like events that much sometimes before they happen with maybe one or

543
03:42:43,329 --> 03:42:51,020
two exceptions, but there's a lot of information to share. Keep an eye on the grotto beast Twitter

544
03:42:51,659 --> 03:42:59,729
and then obviously on here too. I'll be talking a lot about it next week. Oh, I need to tweet this

545
03:42:59,729 --> 03:43:09,180
out. All right. I'm tweeting up my sponsor thing. This is the pig video. Thanks for hanging out

546
03:43:09,180 --> 03:43:16,559
those. Thanks for sticking around. Um, that game's awesome. I feel like civilization Sim thing was

547
03:43:16,559 --> 03:43:45,780
fun too, but pizza tower is very, very good. Now, if you don't mind me, I've got a tweet about a pig.

548
03:43:45,780 --> 03:43:51,920
I'll see you guys on Friday. We're going to finish up pizza tower and I imagine probably something

549
03:43:51,920 --> 03:43:57,579
else. Cause I imagine there's probably not more than another two or three hours. We'll see. Uh,

550
03:43:57,579 --> 03:44:00,620
would raid. Is Vinny playing right now? Vinny's probably playing this right now. Let's raid Vinny.

551
03:44:01,340 --> 03:44:20,110
Why not? Thank you again. I was extra sleepy today. I'm gonna wake up. Well, I didn't get very much

552
03:44:20,110 --> 03:44:28,219
sleep last night. I think I slept four hours, which is not very much. I don't recommend it.

553
03:44:28,219 --> 03:44:37,010
Um, but I was ready to game late night last night. I wonder why.

554
03:44:41,170 --> 03:44:51,889
All right guys, take care of yourselves. Take it easy. All right, hold on. I got to tweet this.

555
03:44:58,209 --> 03:45:08,770
10 30 PM. The perfect time for a sponsor tweet. Let's see. Does it look good? All right,

556
03:45:08,770 --> 03:45:33,219
it's going out and there it goes. Let's see if it, let's see if it hits your feed. Did it hit your

557
03:45:33,219 --> 03:46:08,899
feed? Did it hit feeds? Not yet. What's taking it so long? Hey, there it goes. I said, I don't have

558
03:46:08,899 --> 03:46:28,850
Twitter. Yeah. I mean, I only use it every so often. Very cool. Thanks a lot guys. I'll see you Friday.

559
03:46:28,850 --> 03:46:39,020
Have a good night. Get some sleep. You forgot hashtag ad in the tweet. Uh, no, it says sponsored

560
03:46:39,020 --> 03:47:10,670
by EA. That's fine. I think that's okay, right? No, that's good. It says sponsored by EA in it.

561
03:47:10,670 --> 03:47:29,010
Yeah. Good night. See you soon. Oh shit. Yeah. That's raving. Go say hello to Vinny Vinesauce.

562
03:47:29,010 --> 03:47:34,020
Take care of yourselves. Good night.
