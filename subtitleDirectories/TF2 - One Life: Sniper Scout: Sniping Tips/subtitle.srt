00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:17,230
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, continuing the One Life series, because a lot of people like that.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,230
I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on One Life, so I'm going to keep doing it.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,539
There's two One Life gameplays in this particular video. There's going to be a CP Dustbowl sniper, as you can see right here.

4
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,539
Then there's going to be a scout on Badlands, CP Badlands.

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,710
So before I get started with this one, I've got to tell you that this is probably one of the best sniper gameplays I've ever done.

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,710
I get, I think, 12 headshots or 13 headshots in one minute or something like that, or two minutes.

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,710
It's pretty ridiculous, and I've got a couple of sniper tips for you too.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,710
A lot of people ask me, how do I do sniper? How do I do sniper? I've done videos like this before.

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,210
Two quick headshots right off the bat, and I'll tell you right now, we are playing Guitar Hero right now.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,640
What am I talking about? We're playing Guitar Hero.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,640
If you play Guitar Hero, you know one thing. You have to match the button when the particular note comes down the line.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,879
I'm going to try and freeze this right here and explain this to you, because if you can play Guitar Hero, you can play sniper.

13
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,120
So I want to go back to this headshot I just did on that heavy.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:28,299
Think about it like this. Imagine the heavy's head is one of the notes in Guitar Hero, and your cursor is the place where you have to hit the button.

15
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:35,299
Now remember, in Guitar Hero, your main goal is to what? Hit the buttons right when they pass through your line of sight on the bar.

16
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,299
Alright, so here we go. Here comes Insert, your favorite song here.

17
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,730
Oh my god. We just learned how to play sniper. Oh yeah.

18
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:54,900
Now keep in mind, this does not work for every single sniper shot, but if you line up your cursor in their direct line of sight,

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,900
most people are not going to think that, oh, I better duck and dodge and weave and move around. That's not going to happen.

20
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Most people, when they come out of a spawn or they're going towards a certain goal or a point, they're going to go in a straight line.

21
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Or they're going to go in somewhat of a straight line that you can predict their movement.

22
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:19,900
So if you can put your cursor ahead of people and just match when their head passes through your cursor, you're going to headshot nine times out of ten everybody that comes by you.

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Kind of a weird analogy, I know, but it really does work if you think about it.

24
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,139
So anyways, let's bring it all back to the point where I was at before.

25
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:33,139
Three quick headshots right in a row and watch this soldier bang another in the air rocket jumping headshot.

26
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:39,139
I love those. And by the way, did you guys see that horrible lag compensation scout headshot?

27
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,139
I was probably four or five feet away from him when I got him in the head.

28
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,449
I have no idea what that was all about, but at least it registered on my end, right?

29
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,449
So look at all the spam that's just coming into this room right now.

30
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,449
I can only imagine the frustration on the blue team.

31
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,449
I killed seven or eight people in 30 seconds, so I can only imagine.

32
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:01,449
Guitar Hero headshot, Guitar Hero headshot on that heavy, you saw it.

33
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,449
One or two people get on the point here now.

34
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,449
A soldier and a demo man, and I can't reach anybody from right there.

35
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,449
I got to turn this corner trying. Whoa, I got a spy.

36
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,449
Get him with the Shahansha. I'm looking around for him.

37
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:14,449
I ended up getting him with a smash crit right in his face right there.

38
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:17,449
And I actually didn't even tell you the loadout for the match.

39
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,449
Okay, the loadout is the Shahansha, obviously, you just saw.

40
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,449
The Bizarre Bargain and the Darwin's Danger Shield.

41
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,620
My default setup, absolutely, I love this setup so much.

42
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Get a couple more headshots and I would have got the kill on that scout,

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,620
but he got murdered by that heavy.

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,620
And you know you're doing something right as a sniper when you run out of ammo.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,800
I had no ammo left in my sniper rifle. I had to go get some.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,169
Coming out of the house turns out to be a bad idea.

47
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,169
I got a little greedy. I wanted to try and get up front,

48
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,169
get closer to everybody, see if I could pick up some good headshots.

49
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,169
And also there was another sniper that kind of just came up there in the same window as me.

50
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,169
So here's another sniper tip.

51
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:00,169
If there's a sniper already sitting in one spot, don't go stand right next to him.

52
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:03,169
Make sure you pick your own little spot because that's a bad idea.

53
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:07,169
Because if a spy comes in there, he's guaranteed to probably kill both of us.

54
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,409
Not to mention the enemy team will know exactly where both of us are.

55
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,409
So there's no distinguishing between where two snipers could potentially be.

56
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,410
Oh no, they're both just sitting right there.

57
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,839
So spread out a little bit.

58
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,839
So I happen to notice that a sniper on the enemy team is now trying to counter-snipe me.

59
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,839
Which is fine. I'm all for the competition.

60
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,839
And I get shot right in the side, right here, blink, right there.

61
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,839
And I go, oh my god, it's time to go get some health and counter-snipe this guy.

62
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,839
As you can see, I do some crouching and jumping and stuff like that

63
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,839
because I don't want to get shot right in the face because I don't know where he is.

64
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,839
I'm not sure if he's straight ahead, if he's to the right, if he's on the building or something.

65
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,839
But it ends up being not a big deal because I end up backing up right into the knife of a spy.

66
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,370
So that's the one life as the sniper.

67
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,370
And we're going to transition from that right into the Scout on Badlands.

68
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,370
So this is the Scout on Badlands using the default scatter gun, the Mad Milk, and the Fan of War.

69
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,370
Which I didn't have until like three days ago, apparently.

70
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,800
I thought I had it, but I didn't have it.

71
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,800
You may also be wondering why I picked this particular gameplay when we're getting destroyed so badly.

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
If you look down at the bottom of the screen, they have one more cap to go before they beat us.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
They were beating us the entire time, by the way.

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
But we end up coming back and four-capping them in about two and a half minutes.

75
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
So it's a really, really spectacular gameplay we do.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I don't really do anything too incredible, but it's the fact that as a team effort, we really pushed and we really got back to it.

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It was really fun, interesting.

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I figured I could show it to you guys and give you some commentary on it.

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,040
I noticed a Cloak Spy just started to decloak and was shooting at me, probably with the Enforcer because I had such low life.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
He can see that because he's a spy.

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
I don't have any health, and watch this Scout.

82
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,040
This Scout jumps up there, tries to cap the point on us, and then he just kind of jumps off of it.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,339
I was thinking, what are you doing?

84
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,339
You could have just potentially got that point back.

85
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,339
But we have a couple people on mid now, and they cap that.

86
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:02,839
So now we're back to square one, trying to pressure them as much as we can.

87
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,839
We got the middle.

88
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,839
They don't have any forces up yet, so let's just keep going.

89
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,839
Push, push, push.

90
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
Let's go, honey.

91
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,839
The baby's coming.

92
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,839
Push, baby.

93
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,839
Throw my milk right into the back of the Soldier's head.

94
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
Whoops-a-daisy.

95
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,839
It's not a big deal, though, because I come around the corner.

96
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,839
Scout right here.

97
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,839
Get him right in the back.

98
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,839
Bada-boom, bada-bing.

99
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Let's keep going.

100
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,839
Keep the pressure up.

101
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,839
This is something you...

102
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,839
In five control point maps, if you don't keep the pressure up, you will never do anything, and games just last a million years.

103
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:33,839
So if you have the opportunity to pressure the other team and just keep pushing and keep going, it's something you really have to do.

104
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,019
Me and this Soldier double-team this Scout for a little bit.

105
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,019
I get the assist, not the kill.

106
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,019
And now it's time to try and cap this point as fast as I can.

107
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,019
And this is the turning point of the other team.

108
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:49,019
This Soldier, all he would have to have done is just shot me one or two times, but he ends up actually killing himself.

109
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,019
And then watch this.

110
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:55,019
A sniper comes over here trying to shoot me, and I get the luckiest crit in the world.

111
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,509
Right there.

112
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,509
That's just like, oh, man.

113
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,689
I would have been raging about that.

114
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,689
So now we got that point.

115
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,689
Coming right down here, trying to get the last point.

116
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,689
I know that nobody's out here now.

117
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:06,860
Getting right on the point.

118
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
That's the end of the game.

119
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
We win.

120
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,040
Comeback victory for the win, baby.

121
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Thank you all so much for watching.

122
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I hope you guys enjoyed these two One Life gameplays.

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
I'll see you all next time.

124
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
And take care, everybody.
