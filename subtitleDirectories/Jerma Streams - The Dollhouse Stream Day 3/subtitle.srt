1
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,980
Hey, whoa, daba, atibatabo, ho ho.

2
00:09:40,519 --> 00:10:30,059
That's our family, let's see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.

3
00:14:24,600 --> 00:18:11,059
Yep, these, what are we gonna do, what do you say like with the lip I was just doing, I'm just going.

4
00:18:47,750 --> 00:22:34,220
Just a little too big, can't breathe without these, what are we gonna do, say like with the lip I was

5
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,019
just doing, I'm just going.

6
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,759
Just a little too big.

7
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:23,930
Welcome to the stream, everybody. Welcome to the stream, everybody, it's me, Jeremy985 here.

8
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,170
Just getting to my house that was just recently fixed and upgraded, hopefully.

9
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,670
If I put too much pressure on it, it just, ow.

10
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,640
How's everybody doing?

11
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,039
Hopefully everybody's okay, hope everybody's feeling okay, hope everybody's doing okay.

12
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:06,299
I am not doing okay, this is probably the worst I've ever felt since,

13
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't know, I don't have an oberometer for this because this is the worst ever.

14
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:28,809
Oh yeah, let's, what do we got up here, what's this, wait, wait, I got trapped in the wall,

15
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:34,009
I got trapped in the wall, I got stuck in the wall,

16
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:42,900
I can't, there it is, okay, I got stuck back there, I got stuck in the wall.

17
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:55,299
What is this? Ooh, I didn't know about this, this looks like a staircase.

18
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:09,049
Oh this is, I really like what they did here, ooh, second floor, wow, interesting stuff.

19
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:16,069
I didn't finish this one, this one wasn't finished, I was gonna hopefully do some of that

20
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:21,750
today, some work, but I don't feel like doing any work right now.

21
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,579
They told me that I could finish it however I wanted.

22
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:40,970
What else is up here? Oh yes, the stuff I bought, bed, another bedroom,

23
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:56,950
oh, this one gives me less comfort than this one, I look like Clark Kent, but if he was smaller,

24
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:06,299
didn't go to law school and never went to the gym, I look like fucking Otacon.

25
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes, Snake, what you need to do is, but I'm not smart enough to be that guy,

26
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:24,299
I like this bedroom though, yay, ow, so if you guys knew that weren't here yesterday,

27
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,859
uh, the old house got kind of burnt and we got some insurance money which was immediately used

28
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:41,980
to fix the damage and to upgrade the home. So now we have two floors, we've got a DIY room

29
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:50,180
and we've got all the other rooms that you've seen already, thank you, oh my god. Now the

30
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,339
thing about these stairs is they go down pretty far, this is a very high, this is a very far house,

31
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:04,200
so it takes a few minutes to get down the stairs, takes about 10 seconds, a very big house,

32
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:15,319
that was just huge, that's not the bathroom, that's not the bathroom, I went to the wrong door,

33
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:27,130
that's the wrong door, I gotta go to the bathroom real bad, thank you,

34
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,250
get out of here, I don't even want to use it,

35
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:57,859
I don't think I've washed my hands in a week and a half, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, okay, is it healed yet?

36
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:14,359
Let's find out, I feel better, can I get this off too? Oh shit, this is clipped on,

37
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:23,180
this is clipped onto my body, it's gonna stay, they just have bird shit on me, oh thanks seagull,

38
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:33,400
oh, and by the way, I know you like the robe, I know you do, but, but I, it's too hot up here to

39
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,759
wear this 24 seven, I'll put it on at other times, okay, they really have a huge bird shit on me,

40
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,039
can I put this somewhere, it's way too hot to wear this, do you know how hot it is,

41
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,740
I can't put this on, and by the way, these don't fit, I was so concerned that these were gonna

42
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,099
get picked, because they don't fit, it was, it's a disaster, so I'm gonna be walking around like

43
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:13,079
this is a diaper, what do you mean, wear the robe or no food, wear the robe, I can't see that today

44
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:24,309
to take my glasses off, no robe, no food, fine, what did you hear, here's a souvenir,

45
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:32,659
all right, I'll put the robe back on, but if there's like an article written later this afternoon

46
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:37,300
about like streamer dies of heatstroke on stream, remember whose fault it was,

47
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:58,739
I guess I'll have a cookie, fresh baked cookies, fresh baked cookies from eight days ago,

48
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:17,530
pretty good, it's not even good, you're like, this is like dad, you have like a sleepover,

50
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,969

52
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:44,119

53
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:56,730
that was a good cookie, I love how cookie equals entire meal, one thing I had to make really clear

54
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:04,679
is eating on this stream, eating on stream, right, I can't eat like a full dinner every day,

55
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,840
I can't, what you want me to eat like a full plate of steak or something, no, I'm gonna eat

56
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:16,420
a cookie and I'm good, and I'm like, I have to finish the cookie, right, I can't just throw

57
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:44,780
like a quarter of a cookie away, give me a shower, oh wait, wait, let's go for a shower,

58
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:56,389
with my glasses on, hey, hey, I'll ask Reddit, what's something you do in the shower that like

59
00:36:56,389 --> 00:37:00,389

00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:24,519
stream where we don't like do like the fart is funny joke, you know, I thought we could get,

63
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,769

64
00:37:46,059 --> 00:38:03,619
at least I feel clean, oh, I need to go, I want to go to my bed, I want to go in my bed,

65
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:18,039
oh these stairs, I don't even want stairs, I wanted a flat house where I could walk around it,

66
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:32,710
oh, this is going to be fun, but I don't want to do it, what's that, what's that,

67
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:42,840
I said jorba.net 5.com, jorba.net 5.com official merchandise, don't go and don't, don't go,

68
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:52,250

69
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,840
oh look, there goes one, oh wow,

70
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:11,340
wow, this looks like I'm trapped in here, like hey, excuse me, I'm locked in here,

71
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:18,789
can somebody help me, can you catch me a butterfly, I have to go outside,

72
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:28,300
I'm too tired, I can't catch butterflies, I just got my robe got stuck,

73
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:35,559
all right, I'll go catch butterflies, sleep would have been a great option,

74
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:48,070
you know, go to sleep, but fine, I'll go in and catch a few butterflies, like I care, whatever,

75
00:39:48,550 --> 00:40:06,179
I can make it, I can make it, I think I can make it, but no, of course not, I didn't even show you

76
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,139
outside, I didn't even show you, but we can look at something else too, we can look at the pool,

77
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:23,940
I have a pool now, I almost fell over, I had to just ground myself for a second,

78
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:36,010
ground myself for a second, otherwise I would have puked, we got a pool, and oh cool, oh yay,

79
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:51,030
ow, arm, oh butterflies, oh my god, this is a huge net for a butterfly, what are we catching, mothra,

80
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:58,219
for a fucking Godzilla, oh I think I got one, I think I got,

81
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:07,590
I didn't know that was still turned on, oh cool, butterflies, what songs do butterflies like,

82
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:44,039
one bit me in the neck, ow, that's a pool, there's a fucking other one, get a big house,

83
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:54,789
I gotta get to bed right now, I'm so tired, just I need one night's sleep of good rest in a bed,

84
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:13,980
that's all I need, that's all I want, oh the bed is calling me, it's screaming at me,

85
00:42:22,579 --> 00:49:01,699
I feel great, what a good night's sleep, holy smokes, oh man, I feel like I could write a book,

86
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:04,340
I feel like I could write a play, I feel like I could write a novel, I feel like I could go

87
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,139
for a jog, oh I feel fucking incredible, damn what a good night's sleep can do for you,

88
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:21,500
and a good food, all that good stuff, it's coming off, it's clipped into the microphone,

89
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:30,090
at some point we're gonna have to actually do something about this, oh I feel good though,

90
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:41,269
what a day, oh projects, mystery box, what's in here, why is there a mystery box up here,

91
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:51,210
sounds like a pretty good day to check the mail, I got up a little too fast and I almost just burped,

92
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:59,510
I created a bunch of gas when I just came up really quickly, and uh yeah, I almost just

93
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:14,170
burped on camera, let's check the mail, I feel so good, I could probably even come out backwards,

94
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,659
I can, why don't we do it here too, I bet you I can come out backwards,

95
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:45,880
that's new, whatever it is, there's a piece of mail in here, well this,

96
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:55,019
it's probably one of these kids in the neighborhood, what does it say, it says,

97
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:59,739
Jerma, thank you for involving us in such a unique experience, we have had the time of our lives,

98
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:08,300
the crew, they actually wrote that, they actually wrote that, that's actually really nice,

99
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:14,539
without a crew like this, this is not possible, this is by far one of the coolest things I've

100
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:18,780
ever done, and by far some of the best people I've ever worked with in my whole life, and I

101
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,360
really mean that, all of you, there's tons of people back here, tons of people backstage,

102
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,059
you can't even see them, but uh, but clean this shit up,

103
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:52,710
oh a unicorn, wow, oh it's huge, oh dude, stone cold, oh stunner, don't hurt him, don't hurt him,

104
00:51:52,710 --> 00:52:01,860
I'm not, he's fine, cool, I can't wait to potentially go swimming in that pool with

105
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,980
absolute water in it, you know, fun fact for those of you behind the scenes stuff,

106
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,380
there's supposed to be water in there, it's supposed to be a full pool, but last minute we

107
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:18,900
decided, what an absolute dangerous hazard considering there is a transformer right there,

108
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:40,139
all right, I love it though, I do feel good though, this is a good day,

109
00:52:40,139 --> 00:53:00,059
hey, go to work, you got it, I'm in such a good mood, oh hey, can you cue up, can you cue up

110
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:05,300
like if somebody gets like fucking speared sound, can you cue up like if somebody gets like shing,

111
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:12,440
like speared sound, could you get that like right now, okay, I want like a skewed up

112
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:18,969
spear sound, somebody gets hit with a spear and they get like ah, I know, I, hold on, I'll be

113
00:53:18,969 --> 00:57:20,460
right there, hey, hey, hey, thanks a lot to the crew, I'm coming, thank you, eventually I will

114
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:38,389
get a car, I promise, one day, I don't know when, thanks for the ride, oh shit, I hit somebody,

115
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:44,519
oh my god, I actually hit somebody with the fucking javelin, are you all right, I mean I

116
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:50,809
threw it as hard as I could, I didn't know you're gonna be that far away, is he all right, is he

117
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:56,539
okay, somebody, it's, I see a lot of blood coming out of here, it's like, it's profusely,

118
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:03,820
what was the medical on him, are you sure we can, is it all right, is he okay, okay, I mean why would

119
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:10,570
you stand in the way, I mean I knew I had a good arm, but I mean, you know what, but I'm cheating,

120
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:18,980
you know what I mean, that's a classic fucking comedy joke, all right, that was a good day of

121
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:29,030
work, I am kind of gross, I mean look, I've got a pool back here, I don't even need your choice,

122
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:37,619
I want to go in the pool, look, we got it out here, I'm gonna use it, it's been a long day at work,

123
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,820
I'm gonna get in the pool, just turn it off, otherwise I fucking won't stop touching it,

124
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:58,780
okay, I could wear my, I could wear the same clothes, it doesn't matter, a little cold, cold,

125
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:10,980
what's the thing, you just gotta go right in, okay, I'm just going in, that feels good,

126
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:41,179
ah, oh, butyl berry do one of these, I think so, ah, right there, that feels good, oh, you know,

127
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:46,059
something about cold water, that just really gets into your, gets into your head, it opens up your

128
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:50,619
blood vessels, or closes them, I don't know, either one of those two things, it does one of them,

129
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:37,739
all right, what happened, you feel like I was still alive, but something happened there,

130
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:47,449
I feel like, that was a long day at work, that was really weird, I kind of like just,

131
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:53,210
it felt like I stopped, my head, it was like a split second, my head felt like it was,

132
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:02,869
like my head froze, but it was only like for a second, I don't know, but where's the ladder,

133
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:11,639
what, I'm actually having fun though, I'm having a fun time, what happened to the ladder,

134
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:26,230
where's the, where's the ladder, um, where's the ladder, I have to get out of the pool,

135
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:35,579
I don't want to be in here all day, I've got shit to do, help, somebody help me, somebody help me,

136
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:43,909
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come back, come back, help, help, help, help, help, get in the pool,

149
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:07,849
until it's dead, are you blaming someone else when you decided to get in without a life jacket,

150
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:18,900
oh, you're right, calm down, okay, am I dead, am I dead now, oh, you're very, very dead,

151
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:29,769

153
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:47,849
you look wonderful today, can I just tell you that, the scythe, the uniform, something about

154
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:54,570
the way, the mysterious, the dark, mysterious stranger, you know, usually when people flirt

155
01:04:54,570 --> 01:05:00,889
with death, it's something simpler like blowfish sushi, right, this is a bit complicated, are you,

156
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:05,690
do you mean it when you say that, or are you saying that because you saw me,

157
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:11,530
I mean, I mean it, I do, I think that I, would you like to come inside, maybe,

158
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:16,090
do we have to go immediately, or can we have a drink, can we hang out, you know,

159
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:21,210

160
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:29,130
20 minutes, okay, it's unconventional, but this once, I'll allow it, okay, great, come on in,

161
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,369
I feel, is that normal, should I be doing that, that is normal,

162
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:43,989
usually it's a bit more crying, screaming, I've been crying, it feels like for fucking three days,

163
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:51,590
that's all right, time to see your uncle Ted, isn't that fun, after all, I didn't even know

164
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:58,710
that, I thought he was dead, like, I've already got a spot picked out for you, okay, well, I do,

165
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:04,789
I really do think you're a very, very, very handsome death, oh, stop, stop, you don't mean

166
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:19,460
that, I do, I do mean it, come on in here, why is he in here, hey, I just want to let you know,

one of those small card roller coasters, they tried to fit four people into one,

185
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:18,579
you know how it goes, that's unfortunate, two people choked on churros,

186
01:08:19,539 --> 01:08:24,819
wait, in the audience, oh yes, interesting, dead right away, I feel like you've got a lot

01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:36,260
day, how many people die a day, that's classified, okay, it's probably, is it, okay, I'm gonna give

199
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:55,909
underworld, it's more like, generally speaking, oh, so would you like to spend an evening together,

01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:22,859
that, when was the last time you answered the telephone, if mom wasn't the contact that came

270
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:31,720
up, I have not answered my actual cell phone unless mom is on the goddamn fucking thing,

271
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:37,930
okay, it's becoming spam email now, nobody answers their phone, nobody checks their email,

272
01:31:37,930 --> 01:32:04,979
how do we communicate with anybody, I wasn't done, I wasn't done, hold on,

273
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:12,039
I'm gonna need a little more than that, I'm gonna need a little bit more than that,

274
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,199
I'm gonna need a little bit more than that,

275
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,340
okay,

276
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:37,880
yes,

277
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:55,720
show up, my voice is fucked, this is from screaming for three straight days, show up,

278
01:33:11,289 --> 01:33:15,399
get those bars up, otherwise I'm gonna be in trouble,

279
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:23,979
oh hey, glasses, reddit, 10,000, upload,

280
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:45,100
and you know the pose we're doing, fooled you, fooled you, I'm hungry, very hungry,

281
01:33:48,859 --> 01:33:51,579
exceptional, I gotta clean this up, what happened here,

282
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:06,020
look at this, what a mess, this looks awesome, awesome, looks awful, make food,

283
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:11,979
but I have to have the robot to make food, well can't we just say who cares,

284
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:17,500
and I can just do whatever I want, can I break away from their control at some point, okay,

285
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:39,800
sure, put the robot, this is so hot with this on, can I go like this, no, no, it's just a snuggie,

286
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:55,289
oh yes, snuggie, oh my mic, I gotta be, hold on, I'll go like this, I feel like this is like a

287
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:59,289
fashion trend right now, right, is it like a dress that people wear that looks like this,

288
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,270
with like a halter top and it's like this, right, don't you think that'd be huge,

289
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:13,189
and it goes into a dress, I think I found, look, if you're a designer and you make this,

290
01:35:13,989 --> 01:35:23,909
I want 10%, it goes around all the way back, yeah, all right, food, making food is just annoying and

291
01:35:23,909 --> 01:35:47,579
I'm not doing it, it's been three days, so we're just eating a cookie, not until I,

292
01:35:47,579 --> 01:36:09,720
I'm not dealing with this shit until I eat, we're here on behalf of the king, on what king,

293
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,100
King Elton McCartney, the conqueror of the fifth, as you are new to these lands,

294
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:25,300
you must read the scroll, I need to read the scroll, do we expect you to pledge fealty

295
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:30,739
to the king, if not there will be dire consequences, I don't know what drugs are

296
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:36,819
going around this neighborhood, but it's something hard, pledges fealty, or you'll be severed,

297
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:41,699
so you're gonna, you're gonna kill me if I don't pledge fealty, what's fealty, pledge fealty to

298
01:36:41,699 --> 01:36:53,510
the king for 500 shillings, 500 shillings, is that money, the youngest king Agatha,

299
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:59,020
huh, she needs braces, you know enough, let's do that, okay, wait, well just say that one more

300
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,260
time, my daughter needs braces, I've been on this job for a fucking long dude, okay, you know,

301
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:07,100
it's my fourth appointment, I'm gonna cut your break, who sent you here though, like it was like

302
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:10,619
a joke or something, no I'm here on behalf of the king, and the thing is if you don't pay,

303
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:13,579
I gotta sever your head, I don't know if you ever used one of these, it's kind of dull, it takes a

304
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:16,939
little bit of time, that hurt actually, I've done three today, I'm fucking tired bro, just pay me

305
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:21,180
like 500 shillings, that's like, you know, 20, 21, 200 bucks, you look like shit, you're not even that big,

306
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:25,979
I can literally cut your fucking head off right now, and I don't want to, my arm's exhausted,

307
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:29,659
got a torn rotator cuff, I know, but you look like shit, and I fucking, I could probably beat you up,

308
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:33,819
I could probably punch you in the face and kill you, loser, loser, that poked me in the eye,

309
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:38,140
you're most really gonna do this, can you just cut me a fucking, how much money do you need?

310
01:37:38,779 --> 01:37:43,800
I told you it's five bucks shillings, who is this, who is this guy, don't worry about that,

311
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:52,939
it's not your concern, are you gonna pay or not, look, if you want 500 bucks from me,

312
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:56,699
then I'm gonna have to hear a goddamn song from this motherfucker right here,

313
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:08,180
you want 500, you're not in a position to decide if, who play it, the flute if, I want to hear a

314
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:19,979
song, don't it end everybody else, my music sucks, you both suck, you're both idiots,

315
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:24,460
you both, you both, you both like probably, you probably both stupid, you probably fucking have a

316
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:29,979
30 IQ, very well, all right, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I was told to do that,

317
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:34,220
somebody said do that, who, there's no one here, yes there is, they're up in the sky, I see if

318
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:42,090
no one is, play, just tell him to play again, okay, 500, 500, will 500 get you to leave,

319
01:38:43,369 --> 01:38:50,199
okay, get some music, get some music before I look like an idiot, is it decided, yes take 500 and

320
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:57,560
leave, then we're in an alliance, we're in an alliance, you're not gonna hurt me, are you,

321
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:07,560
yeah, let's celebrate, what are you doing, you know, you can't just take beers out of the fridge,

322
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,680
what is it, what, this neighborhood, I swear to god, everybody is on fucking hard drugs,

323
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:28,420
what are you doing, I toasted the king, no, there's nothing, there's nothing left, this time next

324
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:38,579
year, yes, this time, watch the phone, there's nothing left in here, he drank it all, he's just

325
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:44,659
the guy that comes in, he's the guy that comes in and drinks a beer really fast, that's his thing,

326
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:55,340
that's his thing that he does, hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast,

327
01:39:56,060 --> 01:40:06,810
ah, yeah, yeah, I know a guy that can drink beer real fast, this thing is gross, I'm putting this

328
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:12,250
in the sink, and you left my door open, pledge fealty to the king, well I hope your daughter got

329
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:20,680
the braces, unbelievable, they have a cop here, I think the cop is on drugs too, literally nobody

330
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:28,119
here is, nobody here is sober, okay, there's like a bunch of people doing drugs, I'm the only sober

331
01:40:28,119 --> 01:40:32,489
one in this whole neighborhood, well that's not actually accurate because I've had like three of

332
01:40:32,489 --> 01:40:42,380
those, can I get the bread off the ground at least, what is the king doing here, why is there like a

333
01:40:42,380 --> 01:41:00,619
flute player, hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast, what is this, oh, he left it,

334
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:17,880
I'm watching some TV, I'm gonna put the tube on, all right, what do we got on TV, don't show

335
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:23,479
the TV yet, don't show the TV yet, don't show the TV yet, I wouldn't show the television yet,

336
01:41:24,739 --> 01:41:27,460
I think I need to hit the input button to get this to the right channel,

337
01:41:30,699 --> 01:41:34,140
okay, I gotta make sure, look, I just got it installed the other day,

338
01:41:36,069 --> 01:41:42,819
all right, what's on TV, let's get ourselves on, that's a lot of feedback from a microphone,

339
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:59,590
what we got, what's on TV, what's on TV, channel change on here, turn it on, it's a weird channel,

340
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:07,670
you guys can call 1-800-SEXYMAD, that's S-E-X-Y-M-A-D, we ran out of numbers,

341
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:16,170
to get my service, it costs $2,000 per cleaning, or $2,500 if you want me to wear cat ears,

342
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:22,010
or $150 if you're a giant piece of shit named Jerma, change the channel, change the channel,

343
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:24,970
I don't want to say that, change the channel, what's this?

344
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:41,899
Now future recent events will also be roaming the neighbourhoods and helping out those who are in need,

345
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:46,779
when we replace homes, because we've heard there's been a lot of un-things happening,

346
01:42:46,779 --> 01:42:52,380
fires and drowning, well then there's this main incident, everything that could just be-

347
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,859
Change the channel, change the channel, change the channel, change the channel,

348
01:42:54,859 --> 01:43:00,060
giant piece of shit, he's a big poopy, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him,

349
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:05,460
change channel, change channel, nothing on this one, there's nothing on this station,

350
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:11,539
there's nothing on this station, or are they just doing dead air on this station,

351
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:18,779
change channel, I gotta go, this thing's messed up, there it is, oh back to-

352
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:36,060
So please make sure you give us your credit card numbers-

353
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:41,180
All right get that off, I don't want that fucking TV, TV off!

354
01:43:53,460 --> 01:44:08,659
He's screaming, he's screaming, man TV is weird out here,

355
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:15,380
there seems to be only two or three stations, it must be an antenna, I- what happened to this?

356
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:26,819
What is that? There's three channels on that TV, I don't even want to pick it up, and I'm not

357
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:36,699
touching that because there's poopoo on it, oh my god there's like beer everywhere, this is actually

358
01:44:36,699 --> 01:44:48,329
kind of a disaster, this is gonna get actually cleaned, oh interesting, here's the beer stein,

359
01:44:48,329 --> 01:45:05,909
whatever you want to call this, let's rinse it out, yuck, disgusting, I'm going up into the bed,

360
01:45:05,909 --> 01:45:14,390
I want to sit down, there's just a soda, there's a non-descript soda over there,

361
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:23,979
I want to check out the DIY room, because what does that mean? DIY room, do it yourself, DIY,

362
01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:40,460
I don't want to stream right now, I've got a lot going on, how am I gonna stream on Twitch?

363
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:52,180
Um okay, where's the mouse and keyboard, where's the key, okay there's the mouse,

364
01:45:53,430 --> 01:46:04,439
am I still banned on Twitch? I don't think so, all right starting the stream, I gotta apologize to

365
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,350
everybody, let me go live, it's been like three, it's been like four or five days since I was,

366
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:17,180
I got banned like twice, let me, I gotta apologize, make sure I look okay, I have to look like,

367
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:24,100
I gotta look hot in this video right, because that's what matters, not the apology,

368
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:43,060
I gotta make sure I look good, okay let's go live, and live, hey what's up everybody,

369
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:50,649
Jerma985 here, I know for the last couple of weeks I've been live um only a few times,

370
01:46:51,369 --> 01:47:14,149
and it's been for only like two or three minutes, and then I go BRB, I'll be right back, hey everybody

371
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:18,470
it's Jerma985 here, I just want to get some good comfortable clothes for this stream,

372
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:23,590
because you know it's important stuff we're talking about here, I have to apologize real quick

373
01:47:25,369 --> 01:47:31,609
that I've been I've been I've been away, and I've been not good to you, and you may have seen some

374
01:47:31,609 --> 01:47:35,369
things on the stream, me sleeping, you may have seen me shitting on stream a few times and going

375
01:47:35,369 --> 01:47:39,369
to the bathroom on stream, but I want to say I don't condone going to the bathroom on stream,

376
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:44,170
I find it disgusting and repulsive, and that I find that anybody that would do that would be

377
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:49,689
completely out of their mind, I don't condone it, and it's not me, it's me from a while ago,

378
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:53,930
it's a past me, I just want to say that I'm sorry about my past me that would have actually gone to

379
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:58,649
the bathroom on stream, and that would have gone BRB and gone to sleep, that's not me,

380
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:05,750
that's not me, I would I mean that's not me as of a week ago, that's not me, I'm a new person,

381
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:09,510
I mean it was a week ago, it was a week ago, but it's not me, that's not who I am,

382
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:16,789
I also want to say very very much sorry to Al Migraine, to Amelia, what? I want to say sorry

383
01:48:16,789 --> 01:48:22,149
to Amelia, because they didn't deserve that kind of treatment, and I really feel like that they the

384
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:28,949
that I really just want to say sorry to them, they saw me having sex with death in my bed,

385
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:34,550
and I just want to say that that's not me, that's not me, that's not who I am, I don't have sex

386
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:38,310
with like three different people and like lie to everybody as of a week ago, it was three days ago,

387
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:44,949
but that's not me, I'm not that's not who I am, I woohooed him, we can't say that word,

388
01:48:45,909 --> 01:48:57,220
or can we? I woohooed, woohooed, it's not the same, it's not the same thing chat,

389
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:02,819
woohoo is a different term, although I just really screwed up and said something else,

390
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:08,180
woohoo is different, it's different, we woohooed, we both said woohoo, we had a great time,

391
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:12,260
and look I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm apologizing for that, let me apologize for the apology too,

392
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:16,180
I'm very sorry about that apology, how I said something else that wasn't what we did,

393
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,659
we were upstairs, we rolled around, we went oh woohoo, and that's it, that's all that happened,

394
01:49:20,659 --> 01:55:50,729
that's, so I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for apologizing for the apology, this time I mean it,

395
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:57,369
I know you might, some of you might think I'm like a shitty person, but I don't care, you paid me a

396
01:55:57,369 --> 01:56:02,010
lot of money, so I don't care, but like you know, I'm just gonna do this to make sure everybody's

397
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:10,890
happy about it, I'm sure everybody's happy about that, I'm sorry that I said the S word,

398
01:56:11,529 --> 01:56:17,050
the S word, S-E-I, I can't even say it, oh it's not me, sorry I'm not that person,

399
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,329
S-E-I, oh I can't say it, you know what I mean, like that's not me from yesterday,

400
01:56:21,529 --> 01:56:24,890
from when I went to sleep that time, I can't even say that word, oh I can't even say it anymore,

410
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:49,159
few days, it's been kind of crazy, a gladiator came in and was like threatening to kill me,

411
01:57:49,159 --> 01:57:55,590
and I'm gonna start over again, again, one more time, make sure it looks taller and bigger because

413
01:58:06,619 --> 01:58:10,699
just wanted to give you a quick update of what happened over the last few days and appeal the

414
01:58:10,699 --> 01:58:19,720
ban, I was attacked by a bear a couple times, I don't care, whatever, fuck it, I'm banned forever,

415
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:56,090
don't care, whatever idea, Twitch I got hacked and somebody posted on my behalf and it wasn't

416
01:58:56,090 --> 01:59:03,859
even me, so I'm sorry about it, send that email, send, send, I'm gonna take a shower,

417
01:59:15,289 --> 01:59:22,279
what am I gonna do about money, what am I gonna do, why is the water not working, fuck,

418
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:33,939
how am I gonna get paid, oh, what am I supposed to do, I brush my teeth in the shower

419
01:59:33,939 --> 01:59:44,859
every day, that was a quick shower, what was that, you know the move, you know the move,

420
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:22,710
my arm still hurts from the window, from Twitch, it's not even funny, it's not even funny,

421
02:00:23,430 --> 02:01:01,020
I want to watch TV, that sounds like a plan to me,

422
02:01:04,149 --> 02:01:16,170
what's on TV today, journal on, and good afternoon residents of dollhouse, we have an emergency

423
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:20,729
announcement, there has been a gorilla reported on the loose, after speaking with the gorilla,

424
02:01:20,729 --> 02:01:26,810
we did get some information by the motive of his escape, after dispute with his mother about not

425
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:34,649
liking his girlfriend, he has decided to escape his enclosure, here we have Randy, our specialist

426
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:39,689
in the area on gorillas and bears, Randy do you have any advice to offer citizens if they

427
02:01:39,689 --> 02:01:43,770
encounter this gorilla, well the first thing you have to remember is you're dealing with a wild

428
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:49,050
animal, you're dealing with heartache, so first thing you need to do is make sure that if you are

429
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:53,449
going to approach these animals, make sure you take somebody slower than you, because you want

430
02:01:53,449 --> 02:01:58,090
to be able to outrun them in case you get attacked by that animal, the gorilla, second of all,

431
02:01:58,810 --> 02:02:02,729
don't forget to play dead, because then you'll know what it's like when they kill you,

432
02:02:03,529 --> 02:02:10,010
and then I would advise against pepper spray, bears love the taste of pepper on human flesh,

433
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:15,210
I would suggest rubbing your body with steamed broccoli before going out after these animals,

434
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:19,289
wonderful thank you so much Randy, is there anything else you would like to say, did you get

435
02:02:19,289 --> 02:02:24,409
any more information behind the motive from this gorilla, no really, just the whole conversation

436
02:02:24,409 --> 02:02:29,689
was it was just bananas really, and I it's just crazy, I'm not okay okay, what we're gonna do,

437
02:02:29,689 --> 02:02:38,119
that was fantastic, that was a great segue, tv has been turned off, a gorilla on the loose,

438
02:02:38,119 --> 02:03:06,039
okay, I don't have broccoli, I don't have whatever else it was, yeah really,

439
02:03:08,119 --> 02:03:17,159
right after the segment on television, I want to move, I want to move, I don't want to live

440
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:22,119
here anymore, why does it feel like everything is coming to get me, and there are my glasses,

441
02:03:23,079 --> 02:03:28,600
that was loud, there's my glasses, everybody's coming, everybody's trying to kill me in this

442
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:37,460
town, how could you possibly live here for more than a week, what the fuck, I'm not going out

443
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:41,619
there, you saw what happened last time, I'm not going out there again to get attacked,

444
02:03:42,739 --> 02:03:55,000
I'm gonna call a bear, call a bear, what does that even mean, call bear, call bear, I don't have a

445
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:05,539
bear's phone number, do I, I guess I do, my hand is doing it, hello, I'd like to, I'd like to call

446
02:04:05,539 --> 02:04:14,100
the bear, a bear service to come attack, to help me, I guess, this is real service, okay, thank you,

447
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:20,579
how much does it cost, that's too much money, but all right, god damn it, god, send him, send him it,

448
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:36,470
what the fuck, hey, hey, it's a gorilla in my yard, it's a gorilla in my, shit,

449
02:04:38,710 --> 02:05:19,270
did somebody just say red rum, are we all right, oh that's a quite a mess out here, nobody here,

450
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:25,239
okay, a bear, how much does that cost, a bear service, that was the bear that was here before,

451
02:05:25,239 --> 02:05:31,130
but he was, he was friendly this time, what does that cost, I'm, the maid's gonna have to, I know

452
02:05:31,130 --> 02:05:34,729
Amelia, I, Amelia, I'm still paying for your service, so that doesn't mean you don't come

453
02:05:34,729 --> 02:05:54,119
anymore, 250 dollars for a bear, was it 2500 or 250, I was gonna say that's pretty cheap if it was

454
02:05:54,119 --> 02:06:24,300
2500, good thing it was an extra zero, get this back over here, where it belongs please, this sucks,

455
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:39,689
this actually sucks, it sucks living here, I fucking hate living here, I actually don't like

456
02:06:39,689 --> 02:06:49,609
being here, it's a nice house, but what is this neighborhood, bears, gorillas, people that aren't

457
02:06:49,609 --> 02:06:54,539
drugs just attacking you, we're like church groups that come into your house and just don't even

458
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:59,739
knock, the police just sit on your couch and drink sodas and stuff, people drink beer out of my fridge,

459
02:07:00,699 --> 02:07:29,979
mess, not today, not today, tomorrow, tomorrow, but tomorrow, why can't you just do tomorrow,

460
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:40,579
showed up like this, I'm gonna look, people are gonna be happy about it, hello, I'm going to work,

461
02:07:45,029 --> 02:07:51,659
fine, just wait, I'm coming, that looks like a full car today, do I have to sit in the middle,

462
02:07:52,300 --> 02:12:56,090
no, I don't want to sit in the middle, what, fine, just move, that was a long day,

463
02:12:56,170 --> 02:13:01,399
this is because I sit in the middle because I'm the smallest one, I know I always put it up for grabs

464
02:13:01,399 --> 02:13:05,560
and I always say I'll do it, but that doesn't mean I want to, maybe like next time I can get in the

465
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:12,819
front, like just once, just one time I sit in the front seat, sit in the middle, sucks, I know I'm

466
02:13:12,819 --> 02:13:17,060
like the smallest guy, but whatever, whatever, whatever works, thank you, see you on Saturday,

467
02:13:17,859 --> 02:13:19,140

something stuck in the fax machine, something stuck in the fax machine,

534
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:33,430
you all right, you're gonna be okay, screw you dad, hey, would you look at the time,

535
02:23:34,229 --> 02:23:38,870
I think it's bedtime, I think it's time for me to go to bed right now, okay, come on, Gladys,

536
02:23:39,750 --> 02:32:31,860
close that door, Gladys, oh, I heard, I heard something last night, oh, that was a very weird

537
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:55,209
dream, oh, it's, it's Otto, wait, hold on, there was an explosion last night, it sounded like a bomb

538
02:32:55,209 --> 02:33:07,770
went off, I don't know what it was, I mean, something just followed me, followed me through

539
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:31,129
here, it smelled, what was that, is it a gas line, holy shit, that's not me, is it, oh my god,

540
02:33:31,129 --> 02:33:57,340
I think it is, you want one of these, sold out, what is this, oh, cabinets, the stool's in here,

541
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:03,079
and I'm not gonna show this, because I know, I know what you're gonna do,

542
02:34:03,799 --> 02:34:09,139
I'm not gonna show it, because I know the audio guy, I know what they're gonna do,

543
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:14,579
in fact, audio guy, I don't want you to play the sound that you, that you want to play,

544
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:31,180
play something else, oh, there's a poop emoji in there, okay, what else is in here,

545
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:51,989
these are so heavy, oh, the stool, wow, we had a lot of these, and a smiley balloon,

546
02:34:52,229 --> 02:35:07,479
oh, I kind of don't, oh, that's sad, that's really sad, nice cabinets, what a waste of money,

547
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:22,489
you could have bought literally anything else, what am I doing, decorate, decorate this room,

548
02:35:23,209 --> 02:35:33,430
let me first of all do this, member of Jeremiah5.com, if you want some merchandise from this stream,

549
02:35:34,069 --> 02:35:52,950
it's all sold out, but who cares, decorate, it's probably actually a pretty good time to do this

550
02:35:52,950 --> 02:36:03,290
room, I think so, we'll do this, I don't like this being open, I don't like that,

551
02:36:04,649 --> 02:36:18,170
I don't like that one, I like this one, I like that being open, this fell, get this out of the way,

552
02:36:20,629 --> 02:36:27,129
this is the DIY room, and if you don't know what a DIY room is, do it yourself,

553
02:36:28,170 --> 02:36:35,190
so we're gonna be you and I, of course, gonna be painting these rooms, maybe, pick a good color,

554
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:42,780
I hope you do, hey, want to see something crazy, I command this to go into the bathroom,

555
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:58,299
did it go into the bathroom, it did, I have magical powers, all right, let's move this,

556
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:09,620
I get this out of the way, this is so fucking heavy, my god, what a waste of fucking money,

557
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:27,559
okay, that's not gonna work, that's not gonna work, nothing else is gonna,

558
02:37:29,879 --> 02:37:38,889
what do you have back here for me, what do you have, what the fuck, what, why,

559
02:37:38,889 --> 02:37:52,569
I can't even move these, they're like in 10 pieces, okay, I don't, get all this out of the way,

560
02:37:53,909 --> 02:38:20,680
out of the way, out, get this out of the way, open the door, so I can see what I'm doing, good,

561
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:26,180
all right, what do I want to do, number one thing I want to do in the DIY room,

562
02:38:27,909 --> 02:38:33,270
I think we take out one of these walls, yep, this is a sledge hammer,

563
02:38:34,569 --> 02:38:43,430
what do we got here, all right, this is good, this is a saw, I'm thinking right here, I think so,

564
02:38:44,229 --> 02:38:54,180
what do you think, ready to get some wall, I think so, right there, I want an open bedroom

565
02:38:54,180 --> 02:39:21,559
concept for my VR room, can't really, what happened, what, why does it not work, it's plugged in,

566
02:39:21,559 --> 02:39:34,549
what the fuck, the saw is not working anymore, what happened, I think there's an electrical

567
02:39:34,549 --> 02:39:43,559
problem, the saw doesn't work, the saw doesn't work, oh shit, that scared the shit out of me,

568
02:39:45,219 --> 02:39:49,139
I can't get the saw to work, I'll try to figure it out, let me see if I can get this to work,

569
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:57,129
somehow, I probably lead to the fuse box, probably, that's probably what's going on,

570
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:07,000
where does this go, this goes somewhere, it's taped down over here, but

571
02:40:11,530 --> 02:40:17,079
why would it stop working, I plugged it into the base downstairs, I have like a whole unit

572
02:40:17,079 --> 02:40:20,520
that's down there, there's like four or five extension cords that go out, I don't know,

573
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:35,959
I don't get it, what is going on, what is going on, what the heck is this, who are you, I'm your

574
02:40:35,959 --> 02:40:42,170
neighbor, I'm Jim Matthew, I live next door, what are you doing, what are you doing my electricity,

575
02:40:42,969 --> 02:40:47,209
I plugged this in downstairs, my unit downstairs, what are you doing, no way, that thing's coming

576
02:40:47,209 --> 02:40:51,370
straight from my house, you can follow it down the street, listen, when I grew up, that's called

577
02:40:51,370 --> 02:40:55,450
thievery, I don't know what you think that is, well, I saw a place to plug it in, I plugged it in,

578
02:40:55,450 --> 02:41:00,329
I didn't know if it was yours or not, you didn't check first, no, I mean, electricity plugs are

579
02:41:00,329 --> 02:41:05,450
just, I can just use them, what is this place, this is your plug, yes, my plug, that's okay,

580
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:12,569
which are you, 9-8-0, 9-8-2, what are you, yeah, 9-8-0, 9-8-0, I live down past Edna,

581
02:41:13,049 --> 02:41:18,090
oh cool, yeah, you met Ludwig, yeah, it's crazy, this many people live here,

582
02:41:18,090 --> 02:41:26,170
it's weird, dollhouse lane, listen, I'm gonna need that back, I'm working on a project up here,

583
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:29,049
working on a project, yeah, it looks like it, you have no clue what you're doing, do you,

584
02:41:29,690 --> 02:41:34,729
I don't really, I mean, that is not the right tool for the job, I gotta tell you that,

585
02:41:34,729 --> 02:41:39,370
I tell you that much, that's not the right tool for the job, that's for sure, okay, well,

586
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:45,370
this is more confusing than a fart in a fan factory up here, all right, well, excuse me, Jeb,

587
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:53,129
oh lord, hey listen, I tell you what, that's your electricity, yeah, electricity, so I've been,

588
02:41:53,129 --> 02:41:58,170
haven't been taking it from you, have I, I mean, we'll have to see, my bill has been exceptionally

589
02:41:58,170 --> 02:42:01,850
high, but I thought, how high has your bill been, I mean, a couple extra hundred, a couple extra

590
02:42:02,170 --> 02:42:06,489
per month, listen, my son, he's been doing some weird things on the computer, I figured

591
02:42:06,489 --> 02:42:13,850
there's something like that, but you never know, okay, all right, Jeb, oh lord, so, I tell you what,

592
02:42:15,209 --> 02:42:19,370
you keeping those, you keeping these, no, so these, these appeared last night, I don't even

593
02:42:19,370 --> 02:42:23,530
know where they're from, okay, I mean, because I don't mind, maybe just to pay for the electricity,

594
02:42:23,530 --> 02:42:27,610
I can bring them back to my place, well, I don't actually owe you any money, considering that,

595
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:34,170
well, the electricity, I mean, the electricity's mine, that's the thing, do you know how, I tried

596
02:42:34,170 --> 02:42:39,209
to get this to work, the saw doesn't work, okay, the saw doesn't work, okay, basic safety, yeah,

597
02:42:39,209 --> 02:42:43,129
yeah, yeah, that's a good idea, let me show you a couple things, okay, let me show you, my daddy

598
02:42:43,129 --> 02:42:47,770
taught me this, okay, he taught me two things, NASCAR and how to fix stuff, well, you're not,

599
02:42:47,770 --> 02:42:52,090
you know this stuff, exactly, exactly, holy smokes, okay, the two are pretty synonymous, by the way,

600
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:55,049
so what, what, what can you tell, what, what, what, what should we do in this room,

601
02:42:55,049 --> 02:43:00,569
uh, okay, well, are you, are you like a handy guy, oh, for sure, yeah, absolutely, absolutely,

602
02:43:00,569 --> 02:43:04,729
I mean, I would, I would start for sure, you got to get some paint up on the walls, okay,

603
02:43:05,530 --> 02:43:10,170
probably move some stuff around, it's pretty dirty, tripping hazard, interesting, do you,

604
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:13,930
do you know this guy, he looks a little, I've never seen him before in my life,

605
02:43:14,729 --> 02:43:18,489
no idea, that one guy's lovely though, I've seen him, let me see if I can see who this is,

606
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:24,010
the, is that you, Kiteboga, Kiteboga, whatever, I don't know, I don't know if you've ever heard

607
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:29,610
of those people, German985.com, they're all sold out, okay, I mean, yeah, it seems like you have

608
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:33,129
literally no idea what you're doing, what, what do you, would you think we should start with

609
02:43:33,129 --> 02:43:36,729
painting, is that what you think, well, I mean, the first thing we're gonna have to do is paint,

610
02:43:36,729 --> 02:43:41,930
absolutely, okay, have you dusted the walls yet, uh, I've, I've pre-dusted, have you checked for

611
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:46,969
prints, I've checked for all, yes, yeah, because, well, you never know, did you build this house

612
02:43:47,049 --> 02:43:50,569
yourself or you move in, because you never know if it's like a crime scene or something,

613
02:43:50,569 --> 02:43:54,809
I, I, I woke up one day and I had a sling on my arm and I walked over here and this was just here,

614
02:43:54,809 --> 02:43:59,770
so, I just figured it was mine, a sling on your arm, yeah, I got a broken arm and I, I went through

615
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:06,250
a window, uh, a few weeks ago, um, you went through a window, were you here when the fire happened,

616
02:44:06,250 --> 02:44:10,250
were you, you, I heard, I heard some siren, actually, I think I called the fire department,

617
02:44:10,250 --> 02:44:14,569
is that you, I think I did, thank God for you, because I, I shattered my arm going through the

618
02:44:15,129 --> 02:44:18,889
window, but I'm fine, though, I'm all right, you mind if I, uh, let me show you something here,

619
02:44:18,889 --> 02:44:23,530
okay, so you got the stools, how about pink, you got the stools, does pink work for you,

620
02:44:24,489 --> 02:44:28,729
pink, I mean, I don't think it'll look good, but that's what you want, if that's what you want,

621
02:44:28,729 --> 02:44:32,889
what wall do you think I should do for pink, what do you think, what wall, yeah, what do you,

622
02:44:32,889 --> 02:44:35,930
what do you even do, what are you even doing in here, is this like your, well, this is gonna be

623
02:44:35,930 --> 02:44:40,329
my VR room, I wanna build a jump around in virtual reality, VR, what on earth is that,

624
02:44:40,409 --> 02:44:45,209
virtual reality, virtual, you're getting a headset now, it's gonna be my VR room, I swear,

625
02:44:45,209 --> 02:44:49,370
you kids have no clue what's going on, virtual reality, you called it, what is that,

626
02:44:50,569 --> 02:44:55,049
by the way, I know you probably smelled gas coming up here, gas, like gasoline, it's me,

627
02:44:55,049 --> 02:44:59,209
I just wanna make sure you're aware of that, no, my, my smell ain't that great, but,

628
02:45:02,409 --> 02:45:08,170
gasoline, so you wanna paint over all pink, I wanna paint pink, virtual reality,

629
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:13,049
it's not quite sure what wall we're doing pink at the moment, okay, I mean, what about,

630
02:45:13,049 --> 02:45:17,049
you got this wall here, that's nice, this pretty sturdy wall, back wall, all right,

631
02:45:17,049 --> 02:45:23,000
how about we do pink, I need a tool to open this, have you tested these walls for stability,

632
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:30,809
oh good lord, sorry, I just like to do that, okay, let me get this paint open, you have no,

633
02:45:30,809 --> 02:45:34,329
you have no clue what you're doing, do you know how to open paint, I've opened paint, I feel like

634
02:45:34,329 --> 02:45:41,930
it's a tuna can, I've opened paint, I've opened tuna, you did both, I sure have, you live in the

635
02:45:41,930 --> 02:45:48,889
United States, we had tuna sandwiches every day when we were kids, okay, pink paint for virtual

636
02:45:48,889 --> 02:45:55,780
reality, why is that, I just wanna make sure I wear this, I would probably take off my shoes,

637
02:45:55,780 --> 02:46:00,899
if you don't want them to be covered in paint, you want me to take, so let me get this straight,

638
02:46:00,899 --> 02:46:07,379
you steal my electricity, this is not stirred, by the way, how do I stir this, listen, sit back

639
02:46:07,379 --> 02:46:12,180
and relax, this stuff's easy, okay, it's all intuitive, it's all in your head, okay, you know

640
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:18,780
what you're talking about, Steve, I don't even know your name, Jeb, Jeb, all right, let's get that pink

641
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:25,739
up there, are you a painter, of course I am, okay, good, that looks pretty good, you like that, yeah,

642
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:32,379
so how long you lived here for, oh, you can't even get on my floor, I'm sorry about that, okay,

643
02:46:32,379 --> 02:46:35,180
listen, I told you I know how to paint, I didn't tell you, I knew how to be

644
02:46:36,379 --> 02:46:41,340
cleanly, all right, so we just dump it in here, yeah, dump it, are you a handy person or are,

645
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:47,819
I got hands, yeah, we'll make this work, all right, we'll make this work, what wall are you putting it

646
02:46:47,819 --> 02:46:53,340
on, huh, on the back wall, the back wall, okay, east face and north face and south, I don't know,

647
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:57,180
I don't have a compass, you have no idea, it depends on where the moss grows, you know what,

648
02:46:57,180 --> 02:47:02,139
by the way, you're a mess, excuse me, you're a waste, I'm sorry, did you say a waste, you're a

649
02:47:02,139 --> 02:47:07,979
big fat mistake, I don't understand, listen, my mother told me I fell off the ugly tree and at

650
02:47:07,979 --> 02:47:12,780
every branch on the way, but I have never been more offended by someone I've never met in my life,

651
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:16,219
okay, I'm going for the back wall, and now you're painting, you're just gonna paint now, yeah,

652
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:21,059
man, I have half a mind to leave right now, okay, he's painting, you're painting,

653
02:47:21,860 --> 02:47:24,979
okay, you got to put more, do you think it looks good, you got to put more paint on them,

654
02:47:24,979 --> 02:47:33,989
okay, why don't you grab a brush and help me, why pink again, why was that, why pink, why are you

655
02:47:33,989 --> 02:47:38,950
doing pink, uh, because the demons in my head told me to, okay, you're talking about Satan,

656
02:47:39,829 --> 02:47:43,270
well, it could be, I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet, you want to do nice,

657
02:47:44,389 --> 02:47:47,590
you got to do angled lines, like, do you go up and down or do you go side to side,

658
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:53,030
you got to go side to side or angles, better coverage, by the way, and I really do mean this,

659
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:56,870
and this is not a joke, this is not a joke in the stream, this is not a joke for anything,

660
02:47:56,870 --> 02:48:01,829
this is real life, uh, this is the first time I have ever, in my entire adult life,

661
02:48:01,829 --> 02:48:07,510
in my entire childhood life, have ever put paint on a wall, ever, congratulations son,

662
02:48:07,510 --> 02:48:14,680
congratulations, hey, there's a first time for everything, uh, I don't think we're, we need to

663
02:48:15,159 --> 02:48:19,639
ladder, to get the top of this, by the way, is that, is that why you, is that why you picked

664
02:48:19,639 --> 02:48:24,040
pink, because you've never painted before, or does it have something to do with virtual reality,

665
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:29,959
oh, I just thought it was a cool color, I thought it would look nice, okay, that looks pretty good,

670
02:48:51,719 --> 02:48:55,959
like something living, it's coming from something living, I'm really sorry about this, I really am,

671
02:48:55,959 --> 02:49:00,840

the wall black, I got a couple more minutes, a couple more minutes, yeah, I don't know what

684
02:50:19,579 --> 02:50:22,700

of blank paint, I hope you understand, okay, I just want to get curious, I just want to make sure I

793
03:01:49,239 --> 03:01:51,959
and you don't want to get back home, okay, you don't want to get back home, because you

796
03:02:03,639 --> 03:02:10,329
watching you do this, okay, you see that, that was actually really good for not very much effort,

797
03:02:16,090 --> 03:02:19,450
very easy, hey Jeff, let me see that for a second, let me show you something,

798
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:33,110
Jeff, hey Jeff, get along with it, more afraid in my life than right now, I may have just sold my

okay, give it the sweet touch, right here, yeah, you want to do it, no, it's all you, it's all you,

814
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:16,120
it's your house, okay, how about right in the middle, right there, I feel significantly unsafe,

815
03:04:16,120 --> 03:04:20,760
is all I'm gonna say, what's it, what's it, Mario, you played Mario, whatever it is you're doing, I

816
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:39,420
don't think, oh so long, get out, get down, you mother fucker, that's one thing, you got a bunch

817
03:04:39,420 --> 03:04:43,899
of studs there, are there studs in the wall, Jeff, yeah, what do we do about that, you're gonna have

818
03:04:43,899 --> 03:04:52,520
to take those down at some point, let me use my hands, why don't you take a swing Jeff,

819
03:04:53,319 --> 03:05:11,670
why don't you take a swing, oh that's perfect, yeah man, oh wowee, I'm strong, wowee, you did

820
03:05:11,670 --> 03:05:23,350
that all by yourself, hold on, let me, hold on a second, oh sweet lord, yeah, I got you, I got you,

821
03:05:26,389 --> 03:05:35,290
oh lord, I'm gonna be feeling that for a while, all right, okay, that ain't hard either, what is,

822
03:05:35,290 --> 03:05:40,409
what's left, what the heck is that thing, what is this, a painting, yeah, you could probably get

823
03:05:40,409 --> 03:05:46,729
this down if you need to, can I get this down, hold on, watch out Jeff, no please don't, okay,

824
03:05:48,250 --> 03:05:59,270
I'm at your house man, yeah so that's meant, that's meant for structure, I don't think that's,

825
03:05:59,270 --> 03:06:03,110
I would probably use the screwdriver, yeah, you want to do that or, I would, I would do it,

826
03:06:03,829 --> 03:06:10,540
by the way, I asked for a cookie, you're right, he did ask for a cookie,

827
03:06:10,940 --> 03:06:30,540
okay, I'll get him a cookie, okay, he asked for it, fine, why is that down here,

828
03:06:30,540 --> 03:07:03,819
make no sense, just bringing him up, weird, just bringing him up, you want a cookie, you want food,

829
03:07:03,819 --> 03:07:12,180
of course, gotta be neighborly, gotta be a good neighbor, gotta be a good neighbor,

830
03:07:16,790 --> 03:07:23,100
Jeff, how are you, how are you doing, I've got some cookies for you, thank you, you make those yourself,

831
03:07:23,180 --> 03:07:28,139
yes, I did, it kind of looks like my mother made those, would you like one, yeah, I wouldn't mind,

832
03:07:28,139 --> 03:07:31,260
it kind of tastes like sand, I just didn't want to touch it because I've been touching the ground,

833
03:07:31,260 --> 03:07:34,780
I don't know if I should, I'm not sure if I should eat with these hands or not,

834
03:07:35,579 --> 03:07:42,700
could you feed it to me, you want to just smell them, yeah, does it smell good, yes, they smell

835
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:51,559
great, I'm sorry about that, oh lord, let me ask you something, you built this house yourself or

836
03:07:51,559 --> 03:07:56,520
you bought it, what's that, you built this house yourself or you bought it, I bought this house,

837
03:07:56,520 --> 03:08:01,159
it was upgraded a few times, but I, okay, because this, this is strange, okay, there's no reason,

838
03:08:01,159 --> 03:08:08,579
there's no reason to have this in a closet, okay, and listen to this, right, yep, you see,

839
03:08:10,020 --> 03:08:14,489
this is not mine, look at this, look at this, holy shit, that is real weird,

840
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:20,250
there's something behind here, by the way, we might be able to take this down, but I am not sure,

841
03:08:22,889 --> 03:08:28,889
oh okay, I'm just going to step over, get this fucking thing down, we can't get the door frame

842
03:08:28,889 --> 03:08:39,180
down, I'm not sure about that, you know, there's a painting in here, Jab, let's look at that,

843
03:08:39,180 --> 03:08:45,659
really interesting, do we have it, I want to see what's back there, that's why, I don't know what

844
03:08:45,659 --> 03:08:50,299
that is, I mean, the weird part is that whole painting is kind of like stuck to the wall,

845
03:08:50,459 --> 03:08:53,659
why is it, it's like glued, it's like the previous owner put something there,

846
03:08:53,659 --> 03:08:56,459
all right, hold on, let me see, can I cut it, how old is this house,

847
03:08:57,500 --> 03:09:01,750
hold on, can I cut through it, you got to put a little more effort into it,

848
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:10,620
have you ever used that in your life, I've never used one of these before, I mean in real life,

849
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:18,489
either, okay, first time for everything, that's all right, okay, why would there be a painting

850
03:09:18,489 --> 03:09:25,930
back here, I mean, I guess it could be some sort of shrine, you did say there were demons in the

851
03:09:25,930 --> 03:09:32,389
house, okay, you did say there were demons in the house, maybe someone was trying to do some

852
03:09:32,389 --> 03:09:40,680
sort of, you know, Jab, give me the sledgehammer, okay, I'm gonna walk away now, you can give a

853
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:52,309
little force to it, okay, you're not really good at that, this is definitely something back here,

854
03:09:52,309 --> 03:09:59,899
Jab, what do you think's back there, why is this made of steel, are you kidding me,

855
03:10:01,700 --> 03:10:09,819
holy shit, there are screws here, hold on, okay, there's that too, I mean, you really can't cut

856
03:10:09,819 --> 03:10:16,940
that, I'm scared, have you ever been to the dentist, Jab, I have never been, no thank you,

857
03:10:16,940 --> 03:10:24,979
no thank you, all right, what is the, I don't understand, why is it here, it's the wrong way,

858
03:10:24,979 --> 03:10:28,180
how do I get to go, I'll tell you what, I bet you could cut through it if you'd like, would you like

859
03:10:28,180 --> 03:10:31,299
me to cut through it, how do you get this to go in reverse, okay, let me see, you go ahead and try,

860
03:10:32,500 --> 03:10:37,379
I'll take care of everything for you, can it go in reverse, yeah, this is the wrong thing,

861
03:10:37,379 --> 03:10:42,180
that ain't gonna work, okay, I'll tell you what, where's that knife, where's that knife,

862
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:46,500
Jab, be careful, it's hard to cut through, I'll be careful, all right, I'll be careful,

863
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:50,819
be very careful, I promise, it's a very sharp knife, thank you, thank you, my liege, thank you,

864
03:10:50,819 --> 03:10:56,819
be careful, so you moved here, yeah, how long ago, a week ago, two weeks ago, okay, you married all,

865
03:10:56,819 --> 03:11:00,340
no, you're not married, I've never been married, not married, okay, why not,

866
03:11:01,379 --> 03:11:05,620
because it's not, I'm not ready yet, you know, somebody asked me the same question

867
03:11:06,260 --> 03:11:09,700
a week ago, the same exact thing, the sleep demons are telling you something,

868
03:11:09,700 --> 03:11:14,260
no, somebody that may even be part of your family, I don't know, excuse me,

869
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:18,579
I don't know, just focus on that, it's a very sharp blade, sorry, I've done this a couple times,

870
03:11:19,940 --> 03:11:26,020
unfortunately, this is the most sturdy painting, there's been a few times in my life where I'd

871
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:31,719
have to take down a painting, we're almost done, I'm gonna let you do the, you got it,

872
03:11:31,719 --> 03:11:37,719
I'm gonna let you do most of the work, here, okay, looks good, you seen the fitness,

873
03:11:38,760 --> 03:11:42,040
the instructor, yeah, you might want to do that, has he gone in your house,

874
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:47,719
oh yeah, he goes in your house too, all right, why do you let him do that, that's like his

875
03:11:47,719 --> 03:11:53,799
home invasion, you didn't sign the HOA, no, what HOA, okay, all right, let's see if we can

876
03:11:53,799 --> 03:11:58,680
get in there, let me see that knife, okay, you want the knife, yeah, there you are, I just,

877
03:11:58,680 --> 03:12:03,000
I want to get this away from everybody, oh, I understand, okay, can we get in there,

878
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:09,639
yeah, let me see, there's something back here, I think, here, there's something, good lord,

879
03:12:10,840 --> 03:12:25,299
holy shit, what is that, what is this, there's a safe back here, what is that, okay, and you said

880
03:12:25,299 --> 03:12:32,659
you bought this house, I bought this house, okay, oh my god, it's a safe, you know how to get that

881
03:12:32,659 --> 03:12:41,879
open or not, I don't know the code, hold on, let me try it, okay, let me just double check,

882
03:12:41,879 --> 03:12:45,399
have you ever opened a safe before, because I'm finding there are a significant number of things

883
03:12:45,399 --> 03:12:49,319
you've never done, I watch YouTube videos that can explain it, you listen for the little, okay,

884
03:12:50,360 --> 03:12:57,079
do you hear that, right there, do you hear, right there, okay, yeah, I don't hear nothing,

885
03:12:57,079 --> 03:13:04,040
I can't get it, you could sledgehammer it, I mean, maybe, I do know a guy, this is, I swear to god,

886
03:13:04,040 --> 03:13:09,239
this house was built, like, five days ago, that's weird, okay, I may accept you, I know a guy,

887
03:13:09,959 --> 03:13:14,280
if you need help, I know a locksmith, we could call, you know a guy, I know a guy, I got a guy

888
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:19,079
for everything, we could break it too, you want to try, we could, listen, I'm gonna say, I don't

889
03:13:19,079 --> 03:13:22,920
have a significant amount of confidence, so you're gonna be able to break that safe, if you couldn't

890
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:27,799
break that wall down, but that's just me, I mean, is that like a joke or something, I've been proved

891
03:13:27,799 --> 03:13:32,760
wrong before, but that's all right, if you want to give it a shot, give your guy a call, okay,

892
03:13:32,760 --> 03:13:38,200
all right, can I borrow your phone though, because it's downstairs, it's downstairs,

it's down in the kitchen, okay, yeah, well, you know a guy that can come do this, yeah, yeah,

894
03:13:41,559 --> 03:13:52,120
give me two seconds, okay, two seconds, he knows a guy, okay, to open the safe, I don't know what's

895
03:13:52,120 --> 03:13:57,350
in it, because I, this is an upgrade, I didn't, I didn't know this was even in here, was this part

896
03:13:57,350 --> 03:14:01,510
of the foundation, well, the foundation is on the ground, so, German, what are you stupid,

897
03:14:02,469 --> 03:14:15,670
we're like on a second story, he knows a guy, call him, I think people like tools, because of the

898
03:14:15,670 --> 03:14:20,229
sounds they make, you think that too, you guys think that too, you know what I mean, just like,

906
03:15:22,889 --> 03:15:28,170
hey Jeff, hey, how's it going my guy, good to see you, oh you are a blue collar as always,

912
03:15:54,250 --> 03:15:58,489
fucking sense, this whole house don't make sense, that makes zero sense, he's trying to paint his

913
03:15:58,489 --> 03:16:03,770
wall pink and black, what, pink up there, that sounds dumb, you can go up the stairs, it could be gems,

914
03:16:03,770 --> 03:16:12,440
oh stairs, okay, jewels, gold, there might be gold in there, gold still expensive, if it's gold,

915
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:15,639
that's awesome, who would put a safe in a wall, that's ridiculous,

916
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:23,860
why would you put a safe in a wall, unless it was to hide something very, very important, hey, what,

917
03:16:25,940 --> 03:16:30,920
what the fuck is this, a little bit of a war zone up here, we swear we come in a room, okay,

921
03:16:45,159 --> 03:16:49,559
to break it, didn't want to swing at it or anything, all right, but it's here and I just,

922
03:16:49,559 --> 03:16:53,319
can you get into this, for the record, have you tried to get into it while I was going,

923
03:16:53,319 --> 03:16:56,760
I tried, why would I know what combination it was, I don't know, the sense you're saying,

924
03:16:56,760 --> 03:17:03,000
it should be pretty standard, okay, was it behind anything, it was a painting in a wall, he's a

925
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:13,260
neighbor, yeah, religious, does it mean anything, does it mean anything, can you just let me,

926
03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:17,100
okay, all right, you can stick the painting, something, I don't know if it's a code word,

927
03:17:18,299 --> 03:17:23,180
listen, do you, that's a hot locksmith, I just want to make sure that's clear, that's all,

928
03:17:23,180 --> 03:17:27,659
what's up, beautiful, you called over one of the most attractive locksmiths I've ever met in my

929
03:17:27,659 --> 03:17:31,579
whole life, I just want to know, he's a good looking man, but can you not come on to me,

930
03:17:31,579 --> 03:17:34,700
I'm trying to do my job, appreciate that, just keep doing what you're doing, that's like an

931
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:39,579
ocean violation, he's very, very, he's really, really sweet and he's very sweet, how many days

932
03:17:40,059 --> 03:17:44,780
I told you he can get in anything, ride the boat, the rain, how long was the rain, a week,

933
03:17:45,979 --> 03:17:53,500
the rain, 40 days and 49, 40 days and 49, what's the time frame on you getting into that,

934
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:58,139
the safe, are you rushing me, no, I just was curious, I don't know how long it took,

935
03:17:58,139 --> 03:18:03,659
I mean, the bench, okay, well I hope he gets it, I'm gonna ask you, I'll ask you a quick question,

936
03:18:03,659 --> 03:18:07,819
yeah, are you familiar with the idea that nine possession is nine tenths of the law,

937
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:13,340
you're gonna have to say that again and like explain like I'm five, okay, position, they say

938
03:18:13,340 --> 03:18:18,540
position is nine tenths of the law, you understand that, I will explain it, okay, so conceptually it

939
03:18:18,540 --> 03:18:24,700
would mean, okay, you know what nine tenths is, it means nine out of ten, yeah, I think that,

940
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:31,579
hold on, how many percentages is that, I think here's the point, whoever has what's in that safe

941
03:18:32,540 --> 03:18:40,579
owns it, you understand, you're just making no sense to me, okay, I can't get it, what do you

942
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:46,180
mean you can't get it, I'm fucking with you, I'm the best, okay, all right, you want to get in there,

943
03:18:46,180 --> 03:18:52,420
well you got it, what's in it, whoa, what's in it, okay, okay, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

944
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:56,100
wait a second, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, well we have to have a conversation about,

945
03:18:56,100 --> 03:19:00,340
no, no, no, no, no, let me see that, I don't know, position is nine tenths of the law,

946
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:06,579
no, I have no clue, that's good, you got the safe open, well, you know, it's a pleasure to

947
03:19:06,579 --> 03:19:11,139
work with you as well, it's, you got the safe open, okay, take a couple, you got the safe open, yeah,

948
03:19:11,139 --> 03:19:15,299
thank you, let me see what's in there, well, what if we just figure out payment, let me see what's

949
03:19:15,299 --> 03:19:24,100
in the safe, get downstairs now, okay, why are we going downstairs, because I don't, I want everybody

950
03:19:24,100 --> 03:19:28,340
out of this room, because I don't want to be up here, get downstairs, you might want to pocket

951
03:19:28,340 --> 03:19:32,579
some of that, it's my goddamn house, whatever's in the wall is mine, that's absolute bullshit,

952
03:19:32,579 --> 03:19:37,139
ton of money, I don't, I'm not comfortable with you touching all of the stuff that's in a, in a

953
03:19:37,139 --> 03:19:41,780
wall in my house, you, you didn't even know it was there though, it's my house, so you took it from

954
03:19:41,780 --> 03:19:46,420
my house, I mean, but he didn't build this house, private property actually, he didn't build this

955
03:19:46,420 --> 03:19:52,180
house, hallelujah brother, let's just, hold on, let's wait, let's just go ahead, let's get an ad

956
03:19:52,180 --> 03:19:56,899
break, ad break, I want to get this sorted, I'm sorry, what did you say, a what break, just go into

957
03:19:56,899 --> 03:20:02,819
the kitchen, what is this guy talking about, ad break now, hey, we're going to sort this, thank you,

958
03:20:02,819 --> 03:27:01,540
don't hand people money that didn't do it, I want to take a quick second to go over a couple things,

959
03:27:02,260 --> 03:27:09,780
kind of off camera, with just no, no jokes or anything, I want to talk about the show

960
03:27:09,780 --> 03:27:16,340
and how it even was able to happen in the first place, Coinbase came in at the last second

961
03:27:17,059 --> 03:27:24,420
and let us be able to do this show, and when I, when I say that I mean that, all the things you see

962
03:27:24,420 --> 03:27:28,899
back here were really only possible because of this company here, and I really mean that, I

963
03:27:28,899 --> 03:27:34,340
wouldn't say it if it wasn't true, Twitch came in and gave us a bunch of money, Coinbase gave us a

964
03:27:34,340 --> 03:27:41,299
bunch of money, what you see here is only because of those two companies, and I couldn't afford any

965
03:27:41,299 --> 03:27:47,299
of this stuff, there's no way I could have done any of this on my own, and when you talk about

966
03:27:47,299 --> 03:27:52,819
like sponsorships, talk about sponsors, you've seen the show, you've seen, they've let us do

967
03:27:52,819 --> 03:27:58,899
whatever we want, we didn't have to do anything, Twitch and Coinbase we had, they just let us do

968
03:27:58,899 --> 03:28:06,090
what we wanted, I've used Coinbase for the last five years, those of you that know this channel,

969
03:28:06,090 --> 03:28:12,389
I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to, it was real, and I have to thank them

970
03:28:12,389 --> 03:28:19,379
because without their support the show doesn't happen, doesn't happen without them, and also

971
03:28:19,379 --> 03:28:22,340
there's so many people to thank, we're not going to have that much opportunity to thank everybody,

972
03:28:22,340 --> 03:28:26,780
but seriously I'm going to take the opportunity now, but seriously if you're into cryptocurrency,

973
03:28:26,780 --> 03:28:31,639
if you want to learn more about the space, it's a great place to start, and they gave us a

974
03:28:31,639 --> 03:28:37,079
significant amount of capital to make this show happen, so thank you Coinbase, thank you Twitch,

975
03:28:37,079 --> 03:28:43,879
also while I have a second here, because this is the finale, JK Productions, Community Jake,

976
03:28:44,889 --> 03:28:50,729
this is impossible without these people, Andy Mark, Ghost Commander, Criken and his team,

977
03:28:51,989 --> 03:28:58,940
this went off without a hitch, it's seriously like, sure this is the idea that I came up with,

978
03:28:58,940 --> 03:29:07,000
but you can't do this without a ton of dedicated people, the glass breaking, when we did that,

979
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:12,059
Andy Mark, the engineers and Andy Mark came up with all this stuff, there's so many people,

980
03:29:12,059 --> 03:29:18,549
Ludwig, Kit Boga, Milton, there's so many people back here that you don't see, I wanted just to

981
03:29:18,549 --> 03:29:25,909
kind of address it real quick, because I wasn't going to have an opportunity to, but again I want

982
03:29:25,909 --> 03:29:29,430
to like, we'll focus on, there's so many people to thank, there's so many people that made this

983
03:29:29,430 --> 03:29:37,770
happen, but Coinbase, go check them out, please do, they gave us so much money to do this, and it's,

984
03:29:37,770 --> 03:29:42,340
they just wanted to make a good show, they wanted to make a good show, and I think it has been,

985
03:29:42,340 --> 03:29:48,149
I think it's been a lot of fun, so that's because of Twitch and Coinbase, thank you both of you,

986
03:29:48,149 --> 03:29:54,950
we'll go back to the show, I've actually used Coinbase, I really have, for five years, I mean it,

987
03:29:54,950 --> 03:30:10,020
and I'll go back to the show, let's break the fourth one, what's going on in here, I thought

988
03:30:10,020 --> 03:30:22,379
that was a bug, hey, have you guys heard anything in back, I was just kind of back there, just

989
03:30:22,379 --> 03:30:26,819
messing around a little bit, sure, we were just talking, I mean, yeah, you've got quite a bit of

990
03:30:26,819 --> 03:30:32,809
money here, okay, you've got quite a bit of money, so, hypothetically speaking, we were thinking,

991
03:30:32,809 --> 03:30:38,090
we could make this whole thing go away, that's a, that's a, can I hold that, well yeah, I was

992
03:30:38,090 --> 03:30:43,049
talking to Jeb, and I figured we just split it, you know, maybe three-way, yeah, me, Jeb, and he has a

993
03:30:43,850 --> 03:30:48,809
actually a dog named Buck, you're gonna do a three-way split, between the three of us,

994
03:30:49,530 --> 03:30:53,290
it's in my wall, but he wouldn't gotten in, all right, let me count how much money this is,

995
03:30:53,930 --> 03:30:58,010
I mean, hypothetically speaking, if we were to have taken the money and walked away, no one would

996
03:30:58,010 --> 03:31:04,729
believe you, that we were honest, it's 1200 bucks, so, that's pretty bad math, it's 1200 dollars,

997
03:31:04,729 --> 03:31:08,569
when you were gone, I got something in your hat, listen, I didn't get much beyond the sixth grade,

998
03:31:08,569 --> 03:31:15,690
and I can tell you that, hey, that's 1200 bucks, from what you've done, blue-collar-wise, you seem,

999
03:31:16,250 --> 03:31:24,090
it seems slow, what, you know, the painting, you seem a bit slow, I'm very fast, let me show you,

1000
03:31:24,090 --> 03:31:27,049
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

1001
03:31:27,049 --> 03:31:30,649
that's actually impressive, that's very impressive, admittedly nothing to do with blue-collar,

1002
03:31:30,649 --> 03:31:35,049
that'd be crazy, that'd be an extra violation, just to do that, toy boat, toy boat, and I figured

1003
03:31:35,049 --> 03:31:39,850
out that great white-collar, so, you know, I got a lawyer friend, okay, I just call him in, we just

1004
03:31:39,850 --> 03:31:44,250
square it away, he's got a guy, I don't know why we need law in this, this is literally my house,

1005
03:31:44,729 --> 03:31:47,290
I mean, what do you want, you want me to just give you a hundred bucks, and I'll give you a hundred

1006
03:31:47,290 --> 03:31:53,930
bucks, how much is your fee, zero change, my fee, yeah, it's not, it's not flat, it's percentage-based,

1007
03:31:53,930 --> 03:31:58,489
and then there's a finder, there's a finder's fee, a finder's fee, because I find it, let me just call

1008
03:31:58,489 --> 03:32:05,209
him up, let me just call him up, oh, finder's fee, my giant dollars of bills, call your lawyer,

1009
03:32:05,209 --> 03:32:09,770
sure, get a lawyer in here, you realize you never would have found the money if it ain't for us,

1010
03:32:09,770 --> 03:32:14,569
is this stevenson, stevenson, stevenson, already, you just need a lawyer down here,

1011
03:32:15,770 --> 03:32:20,729
weirdo at nine eight five, nine eight, why don't we just take this and put it like, yeah, there's

1012
03:32:20,729 --> 03:32:24,250
beer here, that ain't your money, that ain't your money, you might want to put it down there, but

1013
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:30,010
yeah, if you could just come down, we just got a dispute really, you mind if I have some of this

1014
03:32:30,010 --> 03:32:36,489
bread, go ahead, yeah, he's being kind of a dick, yeah, so, I don't know if we can just figure that

1015
03:32:36,489 --> 03:32:41,209
out, that'd be great, I'll see you in a bit, is that all you got in this house, this bread, this

1016
03:32:41,209 --> 03:32:44,889
mac and cheese up there, but it takes a while to make, just forget it, could go for a homemade

1017
03:32:44,889 --> 03:32:52,870
cookie, yeah, just eat a cookie if you want, so you know a guy, he knows about finder's fees, he

1018
03:32:52,870 --> 03:33:00,069
knows about your percentage, oh, I'm so tired, get the door, by my house, we're doing everything

1019
03:33:00,069 --> 03:33:03,110
for him, he's like, he doesn't do a lot of work around here, he wants to keep the money,

1020
03:33:04,870 --> 03:33:09,209
hey man, you see that over there, hey, how you doing buddy, how's it going, come on in, come on in,

1021
03:33:10,729 --> 03:33:15,930
wow, this is quite the establishment you got here, yeah, well, it's not mine, it's this guy's, but,

1022
03:33:15,930 --> 03:33:20,889
hey, hey, how's it going, hey, oh, I know you, you play on the same softball team,

1023
03:33:20,889 --> 03:33:26,969
that's right, hey, who's this, is this the homeowner, this is the homeowner, he's a bit erratic, a bit,

1024
03:33:27,530 --> 03:33:32,329
I just don't think he's mentally fit enough to be able to handle the situation, well, nice to meet

1025
03:33:32,329 --> 03:33:39,290
you, but, hey, it's Bob, Doug, Stevenson, part of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy, it's

1026
03:33:39,290 --> 03:33:44,090
been a long day, I'm tired, okay, well, hey, I'm here from the property management law firm of

1027
03:33:44,090 --> 03:33:48,809
Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy, yeah, and I was called down, well, first of all, this

1028
03:33:48,809 --> 03:33:52,809
is quite a nice place you got here, just want to let you know a couple of things, zoning rights

1029
03:33:52,809 --> 03:34:00,729
that we have, okay, all right, now listen, what's, what's the pickle we got, I got $50,000 in, it was

1030
03:34:00,729 --> 03:34:06,250
in my wall, and they want money, okay, so here, let me get, let me get it right, okay, he was stealing

1031
03:34:06,250 --> 03:34:10,250
my electricity for a significant amount of time, I'll make that very clear, the only reason I was

1032
03:34:10,250 --> 03:34:13,690
in this establishment is because he stole my electricity, back in my day, we called that

1033
03:34:13,690 --> 03:34:19,690
thievery, oh, thievery, 100%, 100%, that's a sin, that's in the Bible, then I called my guy here,

1034
03:34:19,690 --> 03:34:23,450
I called my guy, so it was a finder's fee for me, I think that's legal, I think that's legal,

1035
03:34:23,450 --> 03:34:28,329
he's for, I get money, that's right, I call my guy, he takes care of everything, right, I mean,

1036
03:34:28,329 --> 03:34:31,209
look at him, he can take care of anything, you know what I'm saying, hey, ain't that the truth,

1037
03:34:31,209 --> 03:34:36,090
if you lock, I'll open it, you know, we don't have a slogan yet, but we were shopping that one,

1038
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:42,649
my wife was saying the same thing, she said they're locksmiths, hey, so what are we doing here,

1039
03:34:42,649 --> 03:34:46,729
this is what we're dealing with, well, we need to disperse the money, okay, so you found this money,

1040
03:34:46,729 --> 03:34:50,489
we found a saint in the side of the room up there, okay, fucking, there was smithy granite,

1041
03:34:50,489 --> 03:34:55,610
well, now, you say we found the money, so you mean, it wasn't just you who found the money,

1042
03:34:56,409 --> 03:35:00,090
was there some, which one of you, which one of you, we found it and he helped, oh, I mean,

1043
03:35:00,090 --> 03:35:06,809
I found it, 100%, okay, at least nine, well, nine tenths of the law, not possession is nine tenths,

1044
03:35:06,809 --> 03:35:10,090
you know, have you ever heard possession is nine tenths of the law, did he just fall asleep,

1045
03:35:10,090 --> 03:35:19,290
hey, is he, is he literally sleeping right now, is that, does that mean he doesn't want the money,

1046
03:35:19,290 --> 03:35:24,729
you think, is that legal for, maybe we'll just, okay, here, I'll tell you what we're gonna do,

1047
03:35:24,729 --> 03:35:31,450
okay, here's a little bit above my pay grade, I'm gonna have to go in, I think maybe what we should

1048
03:35:31,450 --> 03:35:37,049
do is give him some equal representation, I'm gonna call another lawyer in, okay, why don't

1100
03:40:09,940 --> 03:40:13,540

1101
03:40:17,540 --> 03:40:21,620
I'm with this guy, this gentleman and this gentleman in the locksmith hill, sure,

1102
03:40:21,620 --> 03:40:24,899
yeah, I think I deserve, hey, I'm going to like that, I'll need something back,

1103
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:29,860
and then how is he going to get it, if we put it back in the same, and that's like, I can tell,

1104
03:40:30,819 --> 03:40:38,579
all right, under the bed, I can see it right here, are things getting, I'm gonna have to call Randi,

1106
03:40:50,100 --> 03:40:54,180
about it, you type on your cell phone,

1107
03:41:06,020 --> 03:41:08,180
your shoes untied,

1108
03:41:20,100 --> 03:41:32,020
that is eating the middle, is eating the middle of bread, without eating the crust, a fucking

1109
03:41:32,020 --> 03:41:37,700
offendable offense, I think it is, while it is disgusting, it is not illegal, which one of you

1110
03:41:37,700 --> 03:41:42,969
did that, probably, if I could take a quick guess, could I see what you got in your hand there,

1111
03:41:42,969 --> 03:41:48,969
Mr. Locksmith, let's take a quick little look, oh mommy, cut the crust off mommy, he is a great

1112
03:41:48,969 --> 03:41:54,649
locksmith, he never said he knew how to cut the crust off mommy, right, cut the crust off mommy,

1113
03:41:55,690 --> 03:42:02,889
fucking loser, I think you should try and settle down, you should also conserve some energy,

1114
03:42:02,889 --> 03:42:08,809
maybe if you just had a seat, why don't we just have a seat there, hey Jerma, fuck you, how do you

1115
03:42:08,809 --> 03:42:17,450

eating the middle, hello Randy, hello Randy, thank you, what was in the door, hi, who are you, Randy,

03:42:30,809 --> 03:42:37,690
yes, we are a family, can you tell, she's got my eyes, he's got my build and gets the beard from his

1119
03:42:37,690 --> 03:42:45,129
mom, come on, let me explain, let me explain, let him talk, let him explain, I came into this

1120
03:42:45,129 --> 03:42:52,969
household, I had no expectation of anybody, I helped the guy out, helped his whole room, I get my guy to come in,

1121
03:42:52,969 --> 03:43:00,329
he opens the safe, all right, he opens the safe, he has a fee, he has a fee, I charge, that is an

1122
03:43:00,329 --> 03:43:05,370
honorable thing, everybody knows that, he's got a fee, yeah, send him back, he called, we call a

1123
03:43:05,370 --> 03:43:10,569
lawyer, I don't care how much it costs, give me five grand, I don't care, ten grand, that was me,

1124
03:43:10,569 --> 03:43:17,690
that's fine, thank you, I tried, you got the address already, yeah, it just, just, just calls a,

1125
03:43:17,690 --> 03:43:21,209
calls a fucking ruckus, doesn't matter, I mean, pretty much the whole thing can be solved if you

1126
03:43:21,209 --> 03:43:27,020
just give me the money, that's all I'm telling you right now, what's the role in this, well, I open the

1127
03:43:27,020 --> 03:43:35,420
safe, sir, hey, this is my mom on the phone, okay, all right, okay, is this normal for you,

1128
03:43:35,420 --> 03:43:39,819
uh, no, it's all good, what's, what's the verdict here, what's going on, what's your role in all this,

1129
03:43:39,819 --> 03:43:44,780
so, I was the, uh, well, first of all, I'm the homeowner, yeah, let me just, quick, why is he

1130
03:43:44,780 --> 03:43:49,100
opening the door, I just opened the door, because I feel like it, because I want some fresh air in

1131
03:43:49,100 --> 03:43:53,420
my home, I'm the homeowner, the windows are just fine, sir, I don't think you want to open that,

1132
03:43:53,420 --> 03:43:59,739
uh, we, as, as you're, you should not do that, how about you step over here, we get this solved,

1133
03:43:59,739 --> 03:44:03,899
give me this, let's just do this, all right, so this, from what I understand, this large sum of

1134
03:44:03,899 --> 03:44:10,139
money was found in the wall, in this, on this property, and you assisted in tearing down the

1135
03:44:10,139 --> 03:44:15,180
wall, and you assisted in opening the security device in order to obtain the money, that's good,

1136
03:44:15,180 --> 03:44:21,020
okay, thank you, all right, so, here's, here's how, I, pretty much, knowing the law like I know the

1137
03:44:21,020 --> 03:44:25,420
law, because the law is the law, and the law is the law, this is what we are going to do, I know,

1138
03:44:25,500 --> 03:44:33,500
said that three times in a row, did I, did I, does that affect how, did I, three times, all right,

1139
03:44:33,500 --> 03:44:37,020
so, here is how, this is how we're going to distribute the money, this is how it is, now,

1140
03:44:37,020 --> 03:44:43,100
I believe you had some electricity stolen from you, sir, really quick, sir, I got a quick objection,

1141
03:44:43,100 --> 03:44:50,299
he literally, he may have just kissed a bear, that is, that is a violation in this state,

1142
03:44:56,739 --> 03:45:04,100
I'm allergic, I'm allergic, I'm allergic, no, I'm allergic, I've got allergies,

1143
03:45:06,979 --> 03:45:11,219
yes, so, this is, this is pretty much what, this is how I'm going to rule on this, all right,

1144
03:45:11,219 --> 03:45:15,620
so, here, here it is, did you have electricity stolen from you, absolutely, I think if we pay

1145
03:45:15,620 --> 03:45:23,139
you fair kilowatt hour rates, and I think time in, time in, also, you were doing some handiwork up

1146
03:45:23,139 --> 03:45:29,219
there, emotional damages, well, were you very happy about this, yes, okay, emotional damages,

1147
03:45:29,219 --> 03:45:35,620
too, I think you are, you think you're allowed that amount, where, were you, I open the safe,

1148
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:40,260
were you open the safe, did you have to drive all the way over here, yeah, and did you have to use

1149
03:45:40,260 --> 03:45:44,100
tool time and talent, it's a pleasure to meet you, all right, you got all those things, you know what,

1150
03:45:44,100 --> 03:45:47,700
I think you get, you get that amount, have a good day, and you know what, that's some gorgeous hair,

1151
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:51,459
go buy some more hair product, too, why don't you get that taken care of, that would be nice,

1152
03:45:51,459 --> 03:45:56,180
that is awesome, where's the bear, I have not seen you two in a while, send the bear back,

1153
03:45:56,180 --> 03:46:00,819
send the bear in, don't forget to call your mother, okay, make sure you're there tonight for supper,

1154
03:46:00,819 --> 03:46:05,700
absolutely, and then, I'm gonna go ahead and keep this for lawyer watch, thank you, not like

1155
03:46:05,700 --> 03:46:09,620
paper clips, I need the bear to actually open the door this time, I think this is done, let's go,

1156
03:46:10,979 --> 03:46:13,620
I need the bear to open the door to the house, I don't think I've met you,

1157
03:46:18,739 --> 03:46:26,229
what just happened, why they all leave, where's the money,

1158
03:46:27,450 --> 03:46:33,860
where's the money, why did the bear not come in the house, I looked over, okay, I looked over,

1159
03:46:33,860 --> 03:46:40,250
there's a guy with a fucking bear hat, this is human arms, how much money did we lose,

1160
03:46:41,530 --> 03:46:47,579
they took everything, there's a guy, they just like didn't plan that,

1161
03:46:49,059 --> 03:46:55,670
a guy with like a big bear head is right here, uh great,

1162
03:46:56,069 --> 03:47:02,260
I'm trying to get in the house, but if you got in the house you would have like mauled somebody,

1163
03:47:03,540 --> 03:47:16,620
okay, get that out of my way, what, I lost 50 and then 15, why do we have to have five lawyers

1164
03:47:16,620 --> 03:47:22,420
come in, like lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, and then the bear comes and just sits in the window

1165
03:47:22,420 --> 03:47:33,850
and gives me a high five, I went like this and he just ran away, that safe was in my house,

1166
03:47:34,969 --> 03:47:48,920
why would that ever make any sense, okay, fantastic, fucking dumb, the bear is in the window,

1167
03:47:49,479 --> 03:47:53,879
how would he have gotten in the window, how much money do I have left, how much money is left in

1168
03:47:53,879 --> 03:48:11,639
the bank, we're good, we're good, we're good, don't go that way, wait, it's this way, I want to see,

1169
03:48:11,639 --> 03:48:22,659
hold on, let me take the safe out of here, no, never mind, you know what, I don't feel like

1170
03:48:22,659 --> 03:48:29,139
doing that, I feel like watching television, yeah, I feel like watching TV, that sounds like a better

1171
03:48:29,139 --> 03:48:41,620
idea, I love television, I do, especially this fucked up network, which we see all kinds of

to call, they've been expecting my call, I really don't want to let them down, when you call people,

1320
04:21:09,219 --> 04:21:13,780
yeah, and you annoy the fuck out of them, sure, and you annoy them all day, I think, and they

I don't experience the same thing you do, you don't, yeah, I'm pretty sure that is completely

made up, so just sign right there, interesting, so do you ever hear about HIPAA laws, HIPAA, yeah,

1325
04:21:35,059 --> 04:21:37,459
thing, I'm just trying to scare you away from my house, what do you have a party or something,

1332
04:22:16,440 --> 04:22:19,799
there's somebody in a pink shirt, not the black shirt, I want you to tell the bear, this is gonna

1333
04:22:19,799 --> 04:22:27,239
be a sick sale, not a black shirt, because I got hurt last time, okay, a house warranty, yeah,

1334
04:22:27,239 --> 04:22:33,399
somebody in a pink shirt, well, it's kind of like lavender, yeah, yeah, they're here now, red, just

1335
04:22:33,399 --> 04:22:39,959
don't go off to the person in the black shirt, black and gray, great, sounds good, okay, sounds

1336
04:22:39,959 --> 04:22:52,340
good, how are you, how are you, I've been waiting for you to call me back, yeah, so, so, I'll sign,

1337
04:22:52,340 --> 04:22:55,700
I would actually prefer to do this over the phone, if that's all right with you, you want to do it,

1338
04:22:55,700 --> 04:22:59,459
I feel a little bit uncomfortable not having it be over the phone, even if you just held it,

1339
04:22:59,459 --> 04:23:04,500
if you just held it, you don't even have to call me, yeah, yeah, okay, so, if you could just sign

1340
04:23:04,500 --> 04:23:09,700
on the line, okay, that would make me feel great, the bottom one here, yeah, do you like helping

1341
04:23:09,700 --> 04:23:14,100
people out, I don't like when people take money from people that don't deserve to get stuff taken

1342
04:23:14,100 --> 04:23:18,260
from them for no reason, see, this protects you from anything that might happen to your car,

1343
04:23:18,260 --> 04:23:22,260
I'm actually gonna put a house warranty on there for you, you got a house warranty now,

1344
04:23:22,260 --> 04:23:27,459
phone warranty, this covers everything, thanks, I appreciate that, thank you, is this fake,

1345
04:23:27,459 --> 04:23:29,860
no, that's a real signature, I mean, either way, I get the commission, that's a real

1346
04:23:29,860 --> 04:23:33,780
signature, I'm gonna hang the phone up because it's weird, okay, have a good day, is there a party,

1347
04:23:34,500 --> 04:23:38,100
you're not invited to, if there is a party, you would never be invited, okay, nine,

1348
04:23:38,100 --> 04:23:43,940
you're sleazeball, okay, man, appreciate you, you're, no, don't go, because you need to get

1349
04:23:43,940 --> 04:23:49,860
mauled, is there, excuse me, you have a mall, have you seen the mall, where is that, do you see

1350
04:23:49,860 --> 04:23:54,819
the mall, there's a beautiful mall that's down the street, do you need a warranty for that,

1351
04:23:54,819 --> 04:24:00,180
I could use a warranty for you, because eventually you might not make it, I actually, to the mall,

1352
04:24:00,180 --> 04:24:06,579
I might be able to sell you a warranty against me calling, that is actually a really good business,

1353
04:24:06,579 --> 04:24:11,860
can I ask why you call so much, it's my job, it's your job, but why do you call so much,

1354
04:24:11,860 --> 04:24:16,260
like every four hours, well there's a couple, there's actually a sweet old lady who loves

04:24:44,920 --> 04:24:51,639
okay, listen, I tell you what, I thought that I could, I could quit my job,

I could quit my job, if you help me out, hey, I'm going on in there, if you want, it's all up to you,

1416
04:36:04,229 --> 04:36:10,229
hi, how are you, oh you got some punch, I called for Edna and death to bring a friend,

1417
04:36:11,189 --> 04:36:14,389
not for every single person to show up,

1418
04:36:15,750 --> 04:36:19,909
Amelia, looks like shit, yeah, see you didn't really clean up much,

1419
04:36:20,630 --> 04:36:23,750
no, because you didn't, you haven't been here, yes, I haven't,

1420
04:36:26,979 --> 04:36:35,130
enjoy the house, hi, it's good to see you again, good to see you again, look, if I could just talk,

1421
04:36:35,130 --> 04:36:39,209
please get away from us, I'm trying to talk to him, thank you, thank you very much, get away from him,

1422
04:36:39,209 --> 04:36:44,009
yeah, he hates fun and happiness, look, I just want to say sorry, and keeping promises,

1423
04:36:44,729 --> 04:36:48,810
I just want to say I'm sorry about everything that happened, I didn't expect you to come over

1424
04:36:48,810 --> 04:36:52,970
today, because I called two people over, but in this university called two people over,

1425
04:36:52,970 --> 04:36:56,330
there's been 10 people come over, so you didn't want me to come today, I thought you were going

1426
04:36:56,330 --> 04:37:01,849
to apologize, I mean, I did, it was a mistake that I'm here, but the, in the way this game works,

1427
04:37:01,849 --> 04:37:07,049
when you call someone over, 30 people show up, this isn't a game to me, death's got a pizza,

1428
04:37:07,049 --> 04:37:17,180
you want some, you think I want something from him, how about you two, make more pizza together,

1429
04:37:18,139 --> 04:37:24,169
okay, just enjoy the house, enjoy the place, let's have a party, is this stereo system,

1430
04:37:24,169 --> 04:37:30,169
who brought that, can we get some tunes, I'm gonna walk around and see what you've done to the place,

1431
04:37:30,169 --> 04:37:39,450
I just, there's no CD in here, can we get some tunes, let's get some tunes going,

1432
04:37:40,409 --> 04:37:51,610
all right, what a depressing life I have, okay, cool, well it looks like everybody's here,

1433
04:37:52,889 --> 04:37:55,369
which is weird, because I actually invited over one person,

1434
04:37:56,729 --> 04:38:05,610

1437

1462
04:41:10,069 --> 04:41:17,060
I got it, I got it, I actually got it, it came down, hey,

1463
04:41:17,540 --> 04:41:22,659
I thought someone was calling for me, sounded like heavy machinery being used without protective

1464
04:41:22,659 --> 04:41:29,770
equipment, yes, it was, take a look, I got it down, look, see, we were trying to do it for less than

1465
04:41:29,770 --> 04:41:40,250
four hours, great, no, go ahead, go by, that's fine, all right, I'm gonna get help cleaning up,

1466
04:41:40,250 --> 04:41:49,419
right, yes, that's great, they've been here a few times,

1467
04:41:50,139 --> 04:42:01,849
I'm downstairs if you could, that'd be great, yeah, down here is good, down here is good,

1468
04:42:01,849 --> 04:42:08,569
just make your way over here, I got this beers in the fridge, there's, um, I might need that,

1469
04:42:11,459 --> 04:42:16,569
oh, hey, hey, hey guys, um, nothing, I was just talking to my lawyer friend,

1470
04:42:17,290 --> 04:42:21,930
and he had some interesting information, uh, if you wouldn't mind, this is, you're talking

1471
04:42:21,930 --> 04:42:27,369
to the lawyer about what, just, just some interesting things about this house of yours,

1472
04:42:28,090 --> 04:42:33,830
what's, what's wrong with it, I don't feel comfortable, I'm not a lawyer, what's the party,

1473
04:42:33,830 --> 04:42:38,549
we're having a good time, yeah, looking at the county records and looking at the property maps

1474
04:42:38,549 --> 04:42:44,709
and things, apparently this house was built on, uh, somebody else's property, maybe somebody built

1475
04:42:44,709 --> 04:42:50,150
on somebody else's property, somebody else owns this property that this house has been built on,

1476
04:42:50,150 --> 04:42:57,590
somebody owns this, okay, yeah, so technically, it's probably their house, their property,

1477
04:42:58,709 --> 04:43:03,189
how is that even humanly possible, I've built, this was a house that was built,

1478
04:43:03,990 --> 04:43:07,430
these are the county records that I've obtained, well, how long have you lived here,

1479
04:43:08,069 --> 04:43:11,830
a two, three weeks, not very long, not very long, are you a 985,

1480
04:43:11,830 --> 04:43:13,830
yeah, because I heard someone lived at 983,

1481
04:43:16,310 --> 04:43:25,990
okay, Jeremiah, what do you mean 983, oh, what the, I'm Ludwig, what the fuck, yes,

1482
04:43:26,790 --> 04:43:33,270
this entire time, well, you've been, no, no, no, no, no, we're talking, the land you built on

1483
04:43:33,270 --> 04:43:37,669
is 985 and maybe I passed an eye this whole time to your discrepancies,

1484
04:43:38,310 --> 04:43:45,029
what are you talking about, no, but after I walked in on, oh gosh, after I walked in on you

1485
04:43:45,029 --> 04:43:51,830
and that cretin, is he gonna be okay, well, I think he'll be fine, it's not like he can kill

1486
04:43:51,830 --> 04:43:56,229
himself, I don't, wait, wait, wait, come over here, I need to talk to you, show him the deed,

1487
04:43:56,229 --> 04:43:59,509
show me the deed, what are you talking about, I, this house has been built, I didn't, whose name

1488
04:43:59,509 --> 04:44:05,029
does it say there, whose house does it say, it says 983, I've been building, I'm in, I'm in

1489
04:44:05,029 --> 04:44:11,830
Ludwig's backyard of 983, this is, 985 does not exist, this is an official document, it's accurate,

1490
04:44:12,470 --> 04:44:16,790
well, how does it make any sense, you've been, Amelia, you've built on my land without asking

1491
04:44:16,790 --> 04:44:20,709
and I passed a blind eye because I liked you and I thought we'd get along great,

1492
04:44:20,709 --> 04:44:23,029
what are you talking about, how are we supposed to, how are we supposed to deal with this,

1493
04:44:23,029 --> 04:44:26,549
what are you talking about, you can deal with it pretty simply, deal with it pretty simply,

1494
04:44:26,549 --> 04:44:29,430
it's called you get out, get out of the house, it's how about you get out of my house, no,

1495
04:44:29,430 --> 04:44:35,990
you get out of my house, your house, look at this paper, that deed is, actually, that is a legal

1496
04:44:35,990 --> 04:44:41,029
document and Ludwig owns the property and the home, what the fuck are you talking about,

1497
04:44:41,669 --> 04:44:46,389
so you just got invited over as a party, you're my friend, the law is the law and the law is the

1498
04:44:46,389 --> 04:44:49,750
law, no it's not, this doesn't make any sense, how about you get the fuck out of my house,

1499
04:44:50,709 --> 04:44:58,470
you don't own this house, I own this land, 985 Dollhouse Way, I was having a party and I

1500
04:44:58,470 --> 04:45:02,310
invited everybody, actually I invited two people but you all showed up because everybody in this

1501
04:45:02,310 --> 04:45:05,349
neighborhood, well I thought you wanted to hang out with me, maybe apologize, everybody in this

1502
04:45:05,349 --> 04:45:09,270
neighborhood just cracked apparently and everyone's on drugs, first thing you said to me when I walked

1503
04:45:09,270 --> 04:45:12,869
in is you didn't clean the house enough, I didn't even know you were Ludwig and then you took the

1504
04:45:12,869 --> 04:45:17,509
mask off, does that matter, does that mean you need to treat me with respect if I'm Ludwig,

1505
04:45:17,509 --> 04:45:23,110
okay, it's great, sounds great, that's impossible for me to, that makes no sense,

1506
04:45:23,110 --> 04:45:28,709
don't log into my account, don't stream on that account either, come on let's go discuss this,

1507
04:45:28,709 --> 04:45:32,709
no, what do you mean evict me, I'm kicking him out of this house, no one's evicting me, this is my

1508
04:45:32,709 --> 04:45:39,990
property, I live here, is the sheriff here, no one's evicting me, hey I need your help, Ludwig don't

1509
04:45:39,990 --> 04:45:43,909
let him stream on my account please, well I'm not worried about him streaming on your account,

1510
04:45:43,909 --> 04:45:47,110
follow me, I got banned from, hey can you help me, I got banned from Twitch, I need some muscle,

1511
04:45:47,110 --> 04:45:50,389
where's the sheriff, I can represent, can you represent, yes I can represent, Stevenson, Stevenson,

1512
04:45:50,389 --> 04:45:54,630
Stevenson and Randy, I got banned from Twitch last weekend, I'm gonna need you to help me, I can,

1513
04:45:54,630 --> 04:46:04,549
could you follow me, yeah I could follow you, this is my kitchen, yeah your kitchen, oh now you feel

1514
04:46:04,549 --> 04:46:09,750
bad, it's my house, it's not even your house, it's my house, you built up my property and maybe if you

1515
04:46:09,750 --> 04:46:15,750
treated me nicer this wouldn't happen this way, I don't even know your name, oh there's the sheriff,

1516
04:46:15,830 --> 04:46:19,509
what do you mean the sheriff, get off me, where's my bare friend, he's the only person I like here,

1517
04:46:19,509 --> 04:46:24,150
well he's hopefully not here, oh that should be officer right now, thank you, it's my door,

1518
04:46:24,150 --> 04:46:30,150
I'll take it, yeah, oh sheriff, what are you doing, I'm trying to help, I'm, hey, but we gotta follow

1519
04:46:30,150 --> 04:46:35,430
the law, we gotta follow the law, he's trespassing, what's going on here, he's trespassing and I want

1520
04:46:35,430 --> 04:46:40,229
him out of my house, who, this guy right here, you have proof, book him, yeah I've got proof,

1521
04:46:40,229 --> 04:46:45,750
let me see it, right there, that is a legal document I obtained from port, well what do you

1522
04:46:45,750 --> 04:46:50,389
think it says, okay, I mean it says you, I, well okay, because it's my property, it's your property,

1523
04:46:50,389 --> 04:46:55,750
my property, listen, I'm sorry man, you gotta come with me, it's all legal, listen, it's legal,

1524
04:46:55,750 --> 04:47:00,709
put your hands behind your back, it's not legal, what the fuck, all right, oh I'm actually hurting

1525
04:47:00,709 --> 04:47:07,029
real life, there you go, that's right bear, book him too, all right, all right, you're coming with

1526
04:47:07,029 --> 04:47:13,590
me, all right, man, listen, all right, calm down, all right, calm down, boo, fine, I'll go, fine,

1527
04:47:13,590 --> 04:47:17,590
what the fuck is this, I'm so sorry about this nuisance, I'm sorry about that, come on, can you,

1528
04:47:17,590 --> 04:47:21,509
can you rep for me and just say, what's wrong with you, you're stealing some of the pranks,

1529
04:47:22,869 --> 04:47:26,630
you can keep the punch, welcome to Ludwig's dollhouse, housewarming gift,

1530
04:47:31,540 --> 04:47:34,819
that's a great part, it's a good time, hey, welcome to Ludwig's dollhouse,

1531
04:47:34,979 --> 04:47:43,049
you got him off earlier, sorry if that hurt, are you spiking the punch, all right,

1532
04:47:43,770 --> 04:48:00,119
you're just gonna leave after spike, thank god I'm a maid, all right, my house now, what does it

1533
04:48:00,119 --> 04:48:28,889
smell like cigar smoke, what the zuck happened here, oh it's terrible, should I call my own maid or am

1534
04:48:28,889 --> 04:48:41,189
I my own maid, why is there, okay, I imagine that doesn't belong there, all right, I'll ignore that,

1535
04:48:43,189 --> 04:49:07,340
it still smells like cigar smoke, god, I can't clean this, how do you even begin to clean this,

1536
04:49:08,779 --> 04:49:25,770
there's no trash can for giant drywall, that was covering the paint, okay, right,

1537
04:49:26,650 --> 04:49:32,419
clean that back up, I think the posters are sold out but we could maybe sell that one and I'll take

1538
04:49:32,419 --> 04:50:16,069
that cut, oh fresh baked cookies, well that's ugly, oh this is a fashionable robe, okay, it's really

1539
04:50:16,069 --> 04:50:31,400
wet, okay, that's kind of gross, well that's kind of gross, I'll just take the cookies and be gone,

1540
04:50:31,400 --> 04:50:41,619
gone, having less autonomy is just a living hell, oh now I get to make the bed, okay,

1541
04:50:42,180 --> 04:50:46,099
that makes a lot of sense, clean and make bed should be symbiotic,

1542
04:50:47,220 --> 04:50:58,330
do I have to make the piss bed or can I sleep on the children's bed, you know what the worst

1543
04:50:58,330 --> 04:51:03,849
kind of people are, the people who buy sequin pillows and do this, like what do you think you

1544
04:51:03,849 --> 04:51:30,759
are Houdini, it's just a pillow, relax, what does he even do all day, I'm not gonna bother with this

1545
04:51:30,759 --> 04:51:58,250
room, German must still be home, I should kick him out, oh god, smells like shit in here, right,

1546
04:51:58,810 --> 04:52:09,580
that's, that was the laugh track moment, maybe he had some, it's a little late, shower time, okay,

1547
04:52:11,369 --> 04:52:24,599
uh how would I do this, let's just, you know this is not my first time doing this live,

1548
04:52:25,240 --> 04:52:40,200
okay no peeping toms, you know what the worst thing you can do in a shower is, piss or shit in it,

1549
04:52:40,919 --> 04:52:48,500
it's like other people might use it, you know, I'll do it sometimes but still pretty deplorable

1550
04:52:48,500 --> 04:52:55,340
of me, you know, nothing wrong with pissing as long as you don't shit, all right, that's enough

1551
04:52:55,340 --> 04:53:11,450
shower, that should be, I feel clean enough, there it is, is there another maid service in this town

1552
04:53:11,450 --> 04:53:38,599
or am I the only maid, why are there so many stools, okay, uh what was the point of kicking out

1553
04:53:38,599 --> 04:53:45,259
Jerma, I have two houses now, I could have just charged him rent, I mean at the end of the day

1554
04:53:45,259 --> 04:53:52,630
all he asked me to do was just go on one date, it sounded like we were dating,

1555
04:53:58,540 --> 04:54:09,369
he deserved it, oh it's gonna be tiring, you know if someone really wanted to,

1556
04:54:10,409 --> 04:54:17,209
they could have me take a nice bed, I've seen how you make Jerma act, you don't have to act

1557
04:54:17,209 --> 04:54:21,610
the same with me, we can have a good relationship, you know, actually follow through with love

1558
04:54:21,610 --> 04:54:28,869
stories and not just burn them to the ground by having sex with death, just an option I guess,

1559
04:54:38,630 --> 04:54:47,189
what's the point of parties, it's too many people to even have a conversation with,

1560
04:54:47,189 --> 04:54:51,909
every conversation is dull shit, seven people told me they're gonna go to Japan but COVID hit,

1561
04:54:53,159 --> 04:55:10,979
I don't give a shit, maybe I should call him back sometime, I'm tired, go jogging, go jog,

1562
04:55:13,029 --> 04:55:17,770
so it doesn't matter who's in the titular role, people said oh no it's just because it's Jerma

1563
04:55:17,770 --> 04:55:23,659
that we treat him poorly, but perhaps really you just treat everyone poorly who comes into this

1564
04:55:23,659 --> 04:55:33,000
room, even given the pope you'd probably still make him go jogging as he's fatigued, who do you

1565
04:55:33,000 --> 04:55:43,689
treat nicely, oh jogging, oh hello, are you doing jumping jacks and cigar smoke, is someone ready to

1566
04:55:43,689 --> 04:55:48,810
get fit, are you ready to go for a run, let's jog together, okay let's go, come on,

1567
04:55:49,610 --> 04:55:55,130
high knees, get them up, okay, there we go, we're yummy mummies, okay, we're yummy mummies,

1568
04:55:55,130 --> 04:55:58,729
can we turn around, can we turn around, I'm a bit tired here, are you winded already,

1569
04:55:58,729 --> 04:56:02,409
I'm just a bit tired, okay let's do a cool down, come on, just maybe a cool down, you're looking

1570
04:56:02,409 --> 04:56:06,250
great, thank you, knees up, let's go, these are high, yummy mummies, knees are high, well I'm

1571
04:56:06,569 --> 04:56:09,049
getting tight in the tummies, aren't we, oh gee, oh,

1572
05:02:52,650 --> 05:03:05,779
yeah Christmas, this is amazing, is it even Christmas time, it hasn't even been much colder,

1573
05:03:05,779 --> 05:03:23,560
but this is great, wow, that doesn't seem festive, but maybe for birthdays, why are there so many

1574
05:03:23,560 --> 05:03:40,099
cigars, now wait a second, it feels as though it's a bit short, maybe for the previous tenant,

1575
05:03:40,659 --> 05:03:54,180
make sense, go back outside, go back outside, okay good, garden the flowers, I feel like I've

1576
05:03:54,180 --> 05:04:04,709
spent a lot of time in here, the flowers, these flowers, garden, okay, they need rich nutrients

1577
05:04:05,590 --> 05:04:18,740
and maybe some water, oh hey, how are you, I'm looking for, was it Jeremiah or, what was his name,

1578
05:04:18,740 --> 05:04:23,380
Jeremiah, what do you have there, well listen, I felt kind of bad the other day, we had a little

1579
05:04:23,380 --> 05:04:28,340
bit of a run around about something, I wanted to give him 100 bucks, you know, oh, you seem really

1580
05:04:28,340 --> 05:04:36,340
nice, did you, nice to meet you, well you know what, he just left, okay, but he said you'd stop by,

1581
05:04:36,340 --> 05:04:41,380
yeah, I want you to know, I really like what you did with the place out here, it looks real nice,

1582
05:04:41,380 --> 05:04:46,020
thank you, you picked that yourself, yeah, I would have gone taller, but you know, how about you come

1583
05:04:46,020 --> 05:04:50,020
in, okay, how about you come in, I mean, I didn't want to stay long, so you own the house now,

1584
05:04:50,659 --> 05:04:55,380
you know what, yeah, I own it, but he comes in and out, so you know, I'll just hold on to it for you,

1585
05:04:55,380 --> 05:05:01,060
I mean, listen, I was gonna give him 100 bucks, and listen, I'll give you, you know,

1586
05:05:01,060 --> 05:05:10,340
you know, okay, camo, it doesn't really work on you, because you stick out, like a sore thumb with that

1587
05:05:10,979 --> 05:05:15,619
okay, beautiful body of yours, I really appreciate it, I'd suggest other clothing, I am married,

1588
05:05:15,619 --> 05:05:20,099
okay, married to the game, I am married, so, I'm physically married, I'm just going to, yeah, I'm

1589
05:05:20,099 --> 05:05:26,259
gonna give that to you, well hey, you're a looker, but don't tell nobody I said that, you know,

1590
05:05:27,220 --> 05:05:35,459
yeah, if you're ever interested, okay, 985, 985, and 983, I actually own both, okay, yeah,

1591
05:05:35,459 --> 05:05:40,340
I love what you did with the place, thank you, you look great, yeah, legal dispute, hey, anytime

1592
05:05:40,340 --> 05:05:44,500
you need electricity, anytime you need electricity, there's an extension cord already, and I can just

1593
05:05:44,500 --> 05:05:52,500
use it, it's yours, okay, that's convenient, I feel like it'd be a huge headache, okay,

1594
05:05:56,360 --> 05:06:02,520
pee-pee, poo-poo, or eat-eat, we gotta pick one, because right now it's, well, it's a little all

1595
05:06:02,520 --> 05:06:19,529
over the wall, it seems gross, but they kind of look appealing, oh, clean, yeah, I'll just, this

1596
05:06:19,529 --> 05:06:25,689
seems to be somewhat stereotypical, feels like we could have respected maybe the job more, and

1597
05:06:26,650 --> 05:06:30,810
and been like, oh, maybe that's, that's, that's what they do day to day, so perhaps,

1598
05:06:31,689 --> 05:06:35,049
you know, they could take care of the rest of what they got going on,

1599
05:06:36,009 --> 05:06:40,569
but I'll clean, I'll clean, I've cleaned this place before, and do it again,

1600
05:06:43,770 --> 05:06:53,110
admittedly, all the utensils were me, so I can't be too upset, what is this, small pinata,

1601
05:06:55,029 --> 05:07:05,400
does this have actual pizza in it, what, why is it so red, how do you get pizza that red,

1602
05:07:05,400 --> 05:07:13,750
is it made with beets instead of tomatoes, it's so, it's a week old, why would you put,

1603
05:07:15,110 --> 05:07:20,040
I would have eaten that, okay, I get the white bread thing now,

1604
05:07:26,869 --> 05:07:33,189
there's so much alcohol, does he ever drink water, is there a way to drink water in this

1605
05:07:33,189 --> 05:07:42,860
house, or is it only unmarked sodas and unmarked beers, oh, sorry, I'm not allowed to do that yet,

1606
05:07:42,860 --> 05:07:49,500
okay, but if anyone wanted to feed me, that's what I would do, but for now, I'm staying hungry,

1607
05:07:50,459 --> 05:07:55,259
had someone wanted that to happen, that's what could happen, but we'll never know,

1608
05:07:56,540 --> 05:08:22,470
well, this room's not bad then, I'm anxious just being here, I have to work, why am I being cold

1609
05:08:22,470 --> 05:08:32,299
by Elvin men, I'm a maid, is this for the king, you know, it's been a pretty long day, I had a few

1610
05:08:32,299 --> 05:08:36,619
different things to worry about last week, I had a couple of payments that I was a little laid on,

1611
05:08:36,619 --> 05:08:40,220
it's been kind of a difficult time, and I'm wondering, I think looking for a rail, this is

1612
05:08:40,220 --> 05:08:45,659
the only job I had, this is cleaning this house, whose house am I, did I say it, oh gosh,

1613
05:08:47,180 --> 05:08:53,240
uh, just on my way to work, how's it going, peasant, well, good day,

1614
05:08:53,880 --> 05:08:57,400
Ludwig or Amelia works generally, but thank you, good day to you too,

1615
05:09:50,200 --> 05:10:20,459
I own two houses, it doesn't make a lot of sense to go to work,

1616
05:10:21,340 --> 05:10:25,659
I could just rent out a house, doesn't add a lot of value to society, but

1617
05:10:26,459 --> 05:10:37,189
it's a good way to accumulate wealth, but nothing over 2.6 million, that would be too much, frankly,

1618
05:10:40,069 --> 05:10:48,439
all right, why did I leave it open, if you leave both open, it kind of ruins the illusion,

1619
05:10:48,439 --> 05:10:58,790
never mind, but do people just come to my house, let me take off my work uniform,

1620
05:11:03,380 --> 05:11:12,630
okay, can we do one thing that's good for me, all right, shower, piss, eat, sleep, I think all of

1621
05:11:12,630 --> 05:11:21,240
them would be pretty helpful right now, play outside, yeah, that makes a lot of sense,

1622
05:11:21,240 --> 05:11:36,759
no, I have to piss, oh yeah, play outside, hey, whoa, does this get us in trouble,

1623
05:11:49,299 --> 05:12:10,119
oh, it's fun, good performance, can I do something good for me, I don't want to be outside,

1624
05:12:10,759 --> 05:12:21,819
I'll just, I'll hover near things that I would like to do, and maybe, maybe, you know, it's like a

1625
05:12:21,819 --> 05:12:44,069
hint, didn't close the legs then, didn't mean to do that, it's more looting, okay, there's already

1626
05:12:44,069 --> 05:12:57,380
a lot of piss in the bed, oh, I feel like having a bedroom through a room with a reciprocating saw

1627
05:12:57,380 --> 05:13:02,979
and a sledgehammer, and a knife that is far too sharp, and a bunch of broken drywall isn't the

1628
05:13:02,979 --> 05:13:24,779
safest way to live life, wow, look at this, maybe still available, I don't know, all right,

1629
05:21:03,659 --> 05:21:31,939
what are you doing in my house, you're gifting me cookies, no, stop gifting me, okay,
