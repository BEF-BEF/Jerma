1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:12,339
Good evening. Good early evening. How are you? Oh dude, Minecraft? Today? No.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,980
I did the reason why we start in a couple hours later is because I was actually in a call

3
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,149
and we were talking about all kinds of things for the Minecraft

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,449
uh fuck the king server. That is yes still slated for the 15th. Has not been pushed. It's still

5
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:42,359
going. Uh it's it's gonna be I can't wait. I will have complete and full details on how that stream

6
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:52,100
is going to work tomorrow. Tomorrow after the game awards we're gonna sit here and I'm gonna open up

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:05,000
paint and we're going to go over how it's gonna work. If you have no idea what I'm talking about

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,000
then check the stream tomorrow night because that's going to be half game awards and then

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,640
uh half fuck the king explanation. So I'm a little excited because not only are we doing

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:32,709
fuck the king this coming uh 15th. I'm also about to play right now uh one of my favorite games

11
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:43,900
and I got it's working. It works perfectly fine. I'm ready to rock and roll. We're gonna play

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,689
red alert today. What's gonna do the campaign? I you know what I don't think I've ever even

13
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,370
done the campaign. I think I did the first like two missions and I gave up. This is like 15 years

14
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:07,530
ago. The campaign is really good. I know. I know. So that's what we're gonna do today and maybe now

15
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,129
at this time maybe I'll do like a skirmish where I really test my skills against like a good computer.

16
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:21,719
There's multiplayer that you can do but I want to do that with I want to set that up

17
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,159
with like subs or mods or other streamers because that's more fun that way than just

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:38,009
kind of detonating all the community servers that exist. We'll see if I still am into this after

19
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:46,979
today then maybe we'll open up some multiplayer stuff with actual multiplayer people. You should

20
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,060
do it with Joel so he can pretend to like it even though he hates it. I don't think you can

21
00:02:51,060 --> 00:03:02,020
pretend to like red alert. I think you just like red alert. I dedicated my english project video

22
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:15,590
to you. Hey thanks. Did you make me look good? All right. Are you ready? Are you ready to see

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:36,620
my childhood? I am. Take a look. There it is. Red alert and it's all I got everything. There's no

24
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,460
sound. Now there should be. There will be. They're going to remaster it. Well we don't have time for

25
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:55,830
remasters. We play original hardware. Why is there no audio? Is there actually no audio?

26
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:05,370
Is it so low that you can't hear it? That's weird. All right you ready? This is by the way if you

27
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,580
don't know what uh red alert is it's the best rts that's ever been made. What about warcraft

28
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,500
2? No no no. Sit down. What about warcraft 3? Sit down. What about the original command and

29
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,660
sit down? What about red alert 2? You could. All right hold on. You don't have to sit down

30
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,019
but I don't want you to stand and interrupt my broadcast. Uh what about a warhammer 40k?

31
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:35,860
Dawn of war. The original dawn of war. All right you can you can come up and stand here with me

32
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,720
because that's the only other one that deserves to be there. How hard is this game though?

33
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,120
That's a lot of people. This game's very hard isn't it? All right let's go.

34
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:05,589
Oh what do I want to be allies or soviets? I've got to be the allies. Allied headquarters

35
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:16,579
present day. Good thing I turned it down. Commander. So last transmission? All 900 hours.

36
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:21,620
Since then nothing. Perhaps Einstein escaped. Too much to hope for general. He would have contacted

37
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,180
us by now. This is classified. I know. I sent for her. General von Essling. She is a civilian.

38
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:35,800
That's why I don't get killed. Commander this is Tanya Adams a professional volunteer. She has the

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,899
best voice lines. She will work with you on this mission. Somewhere inside this research center

40
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:50,420
the soviets hold Albert Einstein. We need him back immediately. Get Tanya inside so she can get

41
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,500
Einstein out. Once you have located him bring him back to your drop-off point for immediate

42
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,639
evacuation. Be careful. The base is heavily fortified but not invincible. Their weakness

43
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:15,529
is power. Black out the base and nothing will stop you. Good luck. That's just, that's Tanya.

44
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:25,350
That's the best line in the whole game. We gotta go get Einstein. Here we go.

45
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:40,550
Oh I can feel the nostalgia. There it is. All right, all right. Hold it. Let's, let's go this

46
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,269
way. Holy shit. It's like the blood's rushing to my face right now. I'm so happy to be playing this.

47
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,959
Affirmative. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No. Well and back up, back up. I gotta, I gotta do this

48
00:06:51,959 --> 00:07:01,819
correct. Why is the music so low? Hold on. Game controls. No, no, no. I want to keep that note.

49
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,740
Sound controls. There it is. Let's drop this. Let's raise this. There you go. Now we're, now it's normal.

50
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,970
That's better. Okay let's go. Here we go. So Tanya, if you don't know, Tanya instantly destroys

51
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:33,000
buildings that she walks into. Yes sir. Take out their resources. Don't get run over. Don't get

52
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,740
run over. Okay, I lost a lot of people. I gotta take out their power. Oh shit. This is harder than

53
00:07:42,740 --> 00:08:05,720
I thought it was gonna be. How do we get it? Where's Tanya? Okay, Tanya. All right, let's go.

54
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:17,379
Get in. Wait, how do you attack move? How do you attack move? I don't know. Take out the power. Take out

55
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:26,540
the power. Is it A? No, it's not A. Control is to target individual. Okay, take out the power.

56
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:39,820
Easy Tanya. Don't get killed. All right, the power is gone. Take out their tech center. Got it. What?

57
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:57,830
Oh, I just, okay, I killed Einstein. All right, let's go. Take out the buckets. Please turn the

58
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:12,440
music. I'm gonna turn music up and turn volume down. Take out the power. All right, this is very hard.

59
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,840
Okay, hold on. I don't, this is why I didn't ever play the actual video game because it's very hard

60
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:34,629
to do. All right, I gotta, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right, I want two different

61
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:41,580
groups. You're group one. Group one, I want you to go take out this. Group two, I want you to take out

62
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:55,850
the stuff in the base. Group one. Group two. Group two, take out guys on the right. All right, don't

63
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:05,929
destroy the base. All right, back up, back up, back up. Is that enough? Okay, now I can take a

64
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:17,909
sec. Wake up reinforcements. Don't destroy the tech center. All right, here we go. I gotta think

65
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:23,000
this through. They're, I gotta take out their power. We're gonna wrap around. Let's take everybody

66
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:36,169
over here. Is this still powered? Take it out. Take this shit out. Kill their resources. All right,

67
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:46,759
take out their base. Destroy the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, we took the power. This is good.

68
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,340
All right, I just had to avoid. I don't want to, Tonya can't die. And neither can Einstein.

69
00:10:53,299 --> 00:11:03,460
If Tonya touches a building, it instantly explodes.

70
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:23,299
All right, I'm good. I love this game. Get Einstein to the helicopter. That's Einstein.

71
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:37,340
All right, we got it. I did it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.

72
00:11:48,309 --> 00:12:06,360
Why did they destroy the building? I don't even know how to, how do you attack move?

73
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:28,279
All right, let's do it again. It's not A. All right, just get in there. No, it's not A. All right,

74
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:41,899
let's go. I got him, right? You select and you right click. All right, we did it. I got Einstein.

75
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:53,059
All right, that wasn't so hard. What's going on over here? Oh shit.

76
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:57,019
Where were these guys before? Okay, that was very easy.

77
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:22,759
I got full motion loud cutscenes. Great. All right, only, all right, I had, they had more

78
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:31,179
casualties than me. Therefore, I win. I'm going to turn the base volume down and then turn it up.

79
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,759
Soviet aggression has increased tenfold already. We don't have the manpower to fight Stalin's

80
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:52,889
armies on every front. Commander, you did a fine job rescuing Einstein for us. Now,

81
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,240
we are counting on you again. One of the passes we use for a supply route has been blocked by the

82
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,039
Reds. A convoy from the 434th is due through in a matter of hours. The supplies they carry

83
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:12,840
are critical to our war efforts. That's not a belt. What we have in that area to work with.

84
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,809
That's a power lifter support. And time is against us. You will have to make do.

85
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,940
You wear that to a bench press. So the convoy can get to safety. Their lives rest in your hands.

86
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:35,850
Go. Here's the best part. Here's the best part. Here's the best part. Here comes the best part.

87
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:43,610
Wait, clear the way for the convoy. Yes, sir. All right. I like to play a little bit slower. No,

88
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:58,169
I don't. I got a mess of a volume here. That's, that's probably better. Take a look at this.

89
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:03,210
But you didn't, you know what? They all watch this. Ready? Bang. Power plant immediately. Oh,

90
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,289
also some people are probably going to realize. Where's the guy? Where's the guy talking? Where's

91
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:18,120
the guy? Uh, I deleted him from the game. I literally, I literally modded the game to remove

92
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,460
that guy talking. Building unit, ready unit, lost unit, ready building unit, ready unit,

93
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:33,129
lost unit, lost unit, lost unit, lost. I know I modded them out of the game. All right. Oh,

94
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:39,419
we got, I got a oil refinery. Let's go. Let's start clearing. I don't even need two groups.

95
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:52,549
All right. Go down here. Wait, I'm going to leave a Jeep here. You stay up there.

96
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:07,820
Shoot him. If this guy throws a grenade and kills you, I'd be so mad. The one DB music is good.

97
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:20,759
All right. I, what is attack move? That's attack point. Let's get that down.

98
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:32,149
Oh, they're really, oh, I got a time limit here. A click. It's not though. It's not,

99
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:41,179
it's not doing it. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Attack move. No, it's not. This game was made

100
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:54,340
before attack move was invented. No, no, it was not. All right. We have a, I need an

101
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,889
engineer to repair that Jeep. How are we doing? How are we doing over here? Good, good, good,

102
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:04,170
good, good. We need barracks. No, you guys stay, just stay. And this is like a way you can do like

103
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:14,059
a guard, can't you? My base is not dying. It's fine. I don't think we can get through this.

104
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,059
You don't have any engineers. Clear the way for the convoy.

105
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:27,160
There's dogs. All right. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Don't go up there. You idiot.

106
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,309
The base is right up here. All right. What's going to, I just want a ton of rocket soldiers.

107
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:47,720
You guys go this way. Actually don't kill dogs. What do you, I can't help that. Can I do it?

108
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,549
I know this is the dog house, but it's important. It's a strategic location. Oh,

109
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:10,779
shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Don't be an idiot. More, more soldiers.

110
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Psycho streamer can't help itself. What? This is clear. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Move in,

111
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:45,240
move in. Go, go, go, go, go. Take the whole thing up. Over the base. No, just keep rocket

112
00:18:45,240 --> 00:19:01,619
soldiers coming. They're the best. Construction yard going down. My base is fine. There's nothing.

113
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:15,910
Watch out, watch out, watch out. Oh, that guy died. Run him over.

114
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,910
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Who's still alive?

115
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:42,009
Convoy approaching. Oh, I did it. I got it. Oh, that, that's my, okay. Get in the convoy.

116
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,279
They just have to be protected. Nice. All right. I got it. Loud, uh, full motion,

117
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:56,839
loud video coming soon. This is the best track on the whole entire soundtrack, by the way.

118
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:15,500
They're just going to make it all the way up and that's good. We can't hear it. Hold on.

119
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,650
Yeah, but now it's like, now my, now it's hurting my ears.

120
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:37,660
Hold on. I got to turn it down for me. It's too loud for me. Good. No, not good. All right. How's

121
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:50,809
that? I can do, I can deal with that. That's good for me. All right. Mission two complete. I've,

122
00:20:50,809 --> 00:21:10,730
so this is, I love this. It's all coming back to me. Loud. It needs to drown out your voice. Why?

123
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:24,549
Command and Conquer generals was better. I don't think so. Just wait till I do a skirmish again

124
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:32,740
with like two, like three V three. It's going to be nuts. Wait, so let me just say I'm rooting

125
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:49,289
for the Soviets. Well, all right, which one up or down? Let's go down. It's a nice bridge.

126
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,210
Intelligence recon shows heavy Soviet movement in your area. Nearby bridges are key to Soviet

127
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:01,529
advancement. Destroy all bridges as soon as possible. Tanya will assist keep her alive at

128
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:22,230
all costs. Destroy the bridges. Tanya has to stay alive. How are we doing? Okay. This is

129
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:36,059
over here. I instantly killed that guy. Don't go, don't go and just guns blazing. I got to

130
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:46,839
have a strategy here. Shoot the barrel. Oh no, it's going to like press an alert. No, it's not. I'm

131
00:22:46,839 --> 00:23:03,700
fine. Wait, who just came out of there? Is it a medic? Oh, fuck yeah. Why can't Tanya be in

132
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:18,660
Smash Brothers? Just one guy over here. Get used to those sounds because that's all the sounds

133
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,460
you're going to hear for the rest of the time that I play this. And you wanted me to have

134
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,700
the unit lost. Every time a unit dies in red alert, that guy says that somebody died.

135
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,490
Unit lost. Let's rock. Unit lost. Affirmative. Unit lost. Oops. I just fucking murdered the medic.

136
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,849
It's okay. It's still doable. It's still doable. I didn't know he was going to.

137
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,250
All right, watch out. This is flamethrower turrets.

138
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:20,660
I think I get this. This is mine. It's not mine. I can't pick this up. Come on. This is mine,

139
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:44,519
right? Why can't I get it? I'm taking it slow because I don't want to walk into.

140
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:58,180
Why is this following me now? What's going on? There's three tanks over here.

141
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:11,910
I have to shoot the barrel. Nice. All right. Hey, well actually that's good. That works out for me.

142
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:20,859
I'm okay with that. Somebody said no cha-ching in like 10 seconds. Sad. I don't walk over here.

143
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:30,299
I'll burn instantly. Save the game right there. I wonder if I should go down. Wait, take out the

144
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:37,740
bridge first. Uh oh. What is that? Don't let him land. Don't let him land. Don't let him land.

145
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:49,589
What's down here? Any reinforcements? Any medics? Any friends? Here we go.

146
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:59,180
Crate. That's a crate. Crate. Give me the crate. Give me the crate. Crate. There's an item in it

147
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,299
or something in it. You can get like extra items and stuff. All right. Let's kill this guy. Don't

148
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:19,289
aggro everybody. Money. Wait a minute. Oh shit. I got four engineers.

149
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,779
All right. Stay here. Tanya has to take all four of these guys out.

150
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:40,440
Unbelievable. Good work. All right. Let's go. Now where do I go from here? Up this way.

151
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,369
Don't blow up the bridge again. No. Don't worry. I'm not going to kill anybody. We're just going

152
00:26:53,369 --> 00:27:05,900
to go slow. There's a medic up there. All right. I don't want to kill this. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh

153
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:16,039
shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Watch out for the grenade. He's hurt. Come on. Get over here. Heal us. Heal.

154
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:31,450
Nice. Do it again. Now do it to yourself. Do it to yourself. Oh fuck it. Whatever. All right.

155
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:41,049
No, no, no. Not everybody walk in. Tanya just goes. No one will die. No, this goes self-heal

156
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:58,259
unfortunately. All right. Tanya Goker. Wait. What was that? Wait. What happened? What was

157
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:12,950
that? Uh oh. What was there? Any more bridges? There's like a naval base over here.

158
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:26,329
All right. Everyone get out of the way. We're going to take this thing out. How do I? Oh,

159
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:34,440
we have to go across. Okay. So these turn up the in-game voices. I'm not going to turn the in-game

160
00:28:34,440 --> 00:29:05,450
voice up. How am I going to do this? I think I'm screwed. Tanya's dead if she walked in there.

161
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:34,789
Is it my softlocks? Hold on. It's still a kill. That's all right. I have a save point right here.

162
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:50,490
Good. All right. Don't blow that up. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,

163
00:29:50,490 --> 00:30:06,140
kill. Too late. I was too late. I do want to get. Where are the engineers? Oh, fuck.

164
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:16,200
I have to get these engineers. Where's the music? This is weird without the music.

165
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,259
It's strange without music.

166
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:47,559
Okay. Save it here. My nostalgia. I know. Really. It's true.

167
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:57,750
Let's rock. Let's rock. This feels dark without the music. What do you mean dark?

168
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,359
I'm there. I'm there. Let's rock. Let's rock. And I am doing it wrong actually. It's let's rock.

169
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:35,910
Let's rock. Let's rock. Let's rock. Let's rock. All right. Heal yourself.

170
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:48,089
Save it here. Good. We're still safe. Let's rock. Let's rock. Take this shit out. We can move across.

171
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:59,539
He's scumming. Medic reporting. Let's rock. Yes, sir. I'm there.

172
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:09,990
Don't blow it up. Just go across it. I'm there. Don't trigger this. When we get across,

173
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:15,339
blow up the bridge. But then we can't ever come back. All right. We're going to have an

174
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:28,440
engineer go out and scout. We're good? All right. You go forward. Test for the landmines.

175
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:47,700
Okay. Here we are. Good. Yes, sir. I'm not having any fun. Medic reporting. I don't like this.

176
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,740
All right. We're going to take this out. The engineers can repair buildings. I think they

177
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:03,940
can take them over too. Can they? Don't blow up. Do not blow the bridge up.

178
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:15,299
Do not blow the bridge up. Stay here. Snipe. All right. Get across. Yes, sir. Affirmative.

179
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:25,990
Affirmative. Chew on this. Chew on this. Affirmative. What's up? I'm there. Okay.

180
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:34,470
Slowly. Okay. I'm going to blow this up from a safe distance. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir.

181
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:41,140
Oh, shit. Is that destroyed? No, it's not. Okay. Thank God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Run. Run. No,

182
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:57,319
don't run. We're good. Wait. I think I just did it. I did it. That's it, right? Yes. Okay. We're

183
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:33,659
good. Well, that would have sucked. Turn your volume down. Unit lost. The only reason why you

184
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:40,139
have that guy enabled is for A-bomb launch detected. A-bomb launch charging. A-bomb launch

185
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:46,599
detected. That's the reason why you have that guy enabled, but I couldn't. I just modded him out

186
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:58,920
again. All right. Any more? We got another one opened up right here. Oh, commander. We didn't see

187
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:07,000
you there. Oh, there you are. Commander, I wish I could say I had good news, but not all of our

188
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:18,179
battles fared as well as yours. The Greek front is collapsing and Germany is all but taken. However,

189
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,139
not all is lost. Your efforts have hampered Soviet progress in this area. The bridges you destroyed

190
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:32,219
have caused the Soviets to redirect their forces through a certain mountain pass that I believe

191
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:38,739
you are familiar with. They are gambling that you will not be able to stop them a second time.

192
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:45,429
We got enough screens in this room. Prove them wrong, Stavros. Expect a heavy concentration

193
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:50,789
of Soviet armor. The base you established is still standing. Get it up to speed as quickly

194
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:56,309
as possible. We're counting on you to keep the Reds from breaking through. Fake German accent.

195
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:14,789
We are going to stop them from breaking through. Cut. Hey, can I get a water, please? My throat is

196
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:29,429
fucking killing me. Can I have a water? Reporting. Destroy all Soviet units and structures. Let's go.

197
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,389
Very well. Shoot her out of the air. Acknowledged. All right. I need a...

198
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:39,269
What are they doing? I don't like this. Okay. Oh, shit. I got people down here. All right. Wait,

199
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,269
we got people everywhere. There's one guy up here. We got to get this guy back.

200
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,949
This fighting. I don't know where the fighting is happening.

201
00:36:48,789 --> 00:37:03,960
We need to get back. Get back. One guy. Oh, fuck. That's my base. That's my base they're destroying.

202
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:21,500
I thought it was... What? I was just laying mines? Okay. Don't let them just go over here.

203
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:33,670
Reporting. Very well. Get to work. I need a new one. Kill him. All right. You... I just

204
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,030
dropped two mines for no reason. Yes, sir. Acknowledged. They're just going to keep coming.

205
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:47,340
All right. Put a mine down. Acknowledged. Why is it not going off? Wait, what? Yes, sir.

206
00:37:47,900 --> 00:38:07,269
This guy's crop dusting me. All right. This is where it really begins. Okay. Give me a medic

207
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:17,719
and I get oil refinery. Come on. Hurry up. Yes, sir. Where's their base? I don't know.

208
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,380
All right. Back to work. You can do it now. Go on. And I got another. I got two of these now.

209
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:32,630
Pillbox. Go. Two medics. Yes, sir. Moving out. Ready and waiting. I want a medic with each group.

210
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:43,179
What's my APM? Probably four. Two pill boxes up top. No, I don't have enough money for this shit.

211
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:50,579
What's going on? Yes, sir. There we go. All right. I need... The rocket guys can shoot up there.

212
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:05,900
Pillbox down. Pillbox here. All right. You missed silo. All right. That's good. Now we need... How

213
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,139
are we doing on power? We're doing fine. Radar down. This is a radar dome so you can see where

214
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,900
everything that's going on. All right. We got a pillbox. That's good. Pillbox down here. Tuna

215
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,860
cans. Situated. Oil refinery. Doing strong. More rocket soldiers. They have planes.

216
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,099
Silo is needed. Silo is needed. You guys, trust me, you're going to be really happy that you don't

217
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:35,219
have to hear this guy. Yes, sir. Medic reporting. All right. I want to separate out. I want two

218
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:41,539
groups here. Group one. I want at least three. I want a medic. That's fine. You guys stay down

219
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:48,340
here. Yes, sir. Group one. Group one. Take this up here with you. Yes, sir. Acknowledged. Radar

220
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:56,889
dome. Let's go up here with it. Yeah. All right. I also want... All right. All right. Good. Good.

221
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:02,150
Just defend it. What am I going to do? I got a barracks already. We're going to do...

222
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
This is all I can build right now. So we're going to do two barracks. You're probably asking,

223
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,719
what are you pretty stupid? No. The more of anything you have, the sub tier under it will

224
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,159
go double as fast. I've already checked this out. Rocket soldier. Look at how quick this is going.

225
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:23,000
Now check that out. All right. I'm almost out of money. Acknowledged. All right. We're going

226
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,440
to take the scouts this way. This is the team scouts. Acknowledged. Where's the medic?

227
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:38,119
Heal these people. What are you stupid? Yes, sir. Ready and quick. Yes, sir. Agreed. Acknowledged.

228
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,929
All right. Here come the scouts. Get them all together. I'm going to get pill box.

229
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,409
I'm going to say the tanks will be coming from down here.

230
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,650
So that's a turret. It's better for tanks. This is team one. They're going to stay up. Oh,

231
00:40:51,369 --> 00:41:00,489
look at me. I can do that instantly dead. Not even. Don't kill this.

232
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,300
I need engineers. I don't have any. Fuck. Okay. All right. All right. Where's team one?

233
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:20,409
You guys have to protect. Yes, sir. All right. Let's go. Team one. Stay in this area.

234
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,590
Wait, there's a guard button. I know there is. I played this game when I was like fucking 12.

235
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,380
I know there's a guard button. Affirmative. All right. What do we got? 1900. Get another,

236
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:37,659
get another or finally. No, another pill box. No. Yeah. Another pill box. Ready. Acknowledged.

237
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:45,159
Let's go scout. Acknowledged. G is guarding. Acknowledged. Acknowledged. Acknowledged.

238
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,030
G, you hold. Isn't there a patrol too? Acknowledged. All right. Where do I want this?

239
00:41:51,030 --> 00:42:01,079
Probably over here. Okay. Hold on. You hold P. Acknowledged. Does that work? I just held it.

240
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,500
Why is it not working? That was red alert too. All right. Hold on. This is bad. Yes, sir. Wait

241
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:18,300
for the rocketeers. We're going in. Go for the tank first. Go. Kill the tank. Kill the tank.

242
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:28,010
Don't let them. Don't let them just run you over. Disaster. Absolute fucking disaster.

243
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:38,840
Are they going to counter? Okay. They're going to be coming in for a counter. Yes, sir. Run them

244
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:56,170
over. I need a war factory. I got destroyed. I know. Three guys in a tank versus 15 people.

245
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:04,710
Yes, sir. Acknowledged. Acknowledged. Acknowledged. Affirmative. Good. Okay. Keep going. Where's that

246
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:13,340
war factory? I need money. Prepare the buildings. I need an engineer. I think you need a war factory

247
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:29,449
for an engineer. Acknowledged. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. More effective.

248
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:42,199
Okay. All right. Give me my war factory. No. Stop. Stop. Stop spending money. All right. These are

249
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:55,079
all. They never expected. Let's go. Oh, fuck. Look at all these rockets. This is good. I'm

250
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:12,980
going to melt this thing. Watch this. Nice. Good. Go this way. Yes, sir. Agreed. Agreed.

251
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:19,590
Very well. Affirmative. I need my war factory. I need more money. Hurry up and pick this up.

252
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:27,510
Agreed. These guys are so slow. I need the things to carry them. Can tanks take that

253
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,989
many rockets? No. The rocket guys are amazing against tanks. And I'm one of those idiots

254
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,550
that only makes rocket guys and they get destroyed by regular infantry.

255
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:44,059
Give me the war truck. Ready and waiting. At once. Save the game here too, by the way.

256
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,920
All right. Vehicle report. Yes, sir. Acknowledged. Affirmative. Stop. Stop. What are you doing?

257
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,349
Acknowledged. Acknowledged. Where's the base? It's like right here.

258
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:04,070
Affirmative. All right. Affirmative. Here we go. Affirmative. If they counterattack,

259
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:12,969
I lose. Affirmative. Acknowledged. Affirmative. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. Back up. Back up.

260
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:16,570
Back up. Not worth it. Not going to happen. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. Don't go in.

261
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:23,860
Don't go in. Bad idea. All right. He singled himself out. He's an idiot. Get him. Acknowledged.

262
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,969
They have three tanks. I'm going to lose. Acknowledged. Back up to the base. Back to

263
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:33,289
the base. Back to the base. All right. Now it looks like I can see where they are.

264
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:44,380
Keep. These guys have... Okay. I need war truck. Is there any more ore? Oh,

265
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,940
fuck. There's no ore. Affirmative. Okay. I have to go up and get the ore up here.

266
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:57,579
Affirmative. I can't make an engineer? Surface depot. All right. Wait. I need a tank.

267

Awaiting orders. Affirmative. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh,

00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:10,860
ready to come this way. Everybody get over here. Very well. Affirmative. Vehicle.

270
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:21,190
Affirmative. Okay. Now this thing is useless. I don't have any money. I've spent my resources

271
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:28,550
so poorly. What's firing? Oh, my God. I'm going to lose. Oh, this is terrible. Stay back. Stay

272
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:35,099
back. Stay back. Just deposit your money and stay here. Deposit your money and stay.

273
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:41,530
Reporting. Yes, sir. Acknowledged. Three. Affirmative. Very well.

274
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:58,809
Some of you go. All right. I need. I spent my money in bad places. Kill it. Kill it. Kill

275
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:15,929

276
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:31,369
Run them over. Yes, sir. Okay. We're looking good. Okay. Here they come. This is the next phase.

277
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:49,269
Affirmative. Yes, sir. What shitty APM they have. Don't run them over. Make it out. Good.

278
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:57,619
Don't ever underestimate a dickload of rocket guys. Vehicle reporting. All right. I need to

279
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:02,099
start. I gotta start. Oh, my God. They're just going to forever feed people over here, aren't

280
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:21,579
they? That's the never-ending harass. Affirmative. Get it. Strike first. Kill them. Yes, sir. Okay.

281
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:25,179
Now, I got my money's back. Where's my order trucks? They're all doing well.

282
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:47,050
Tanks. I just want tanks. God damn it. These are so slow. I need another war factory. Those are

283
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:57,059
expensive though. The $2,000. I just need to get a couple more tanks. I would feel comfortable with

284
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:09,050
four tanks. So, after this, we're going. Awaiting order. Acknowledge. Agree. This thing is. All

285
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,730
right. This thing's useless. I'm just going to. No, no, no. I'm going to run this thing to its death

286
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:22,280
so I can see what's going on over there. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir. The computer mouse

287
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:35,059
can just go die up here if he cares. Go, go, go, go. Affirmative. You need to see what's up here.

288
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,480
You idiot. Why'd you stop? I think that's it. I think we can go. They have heavy tanks though.

289
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,369
Oh, all right. I'm going to do it. Vehicle reporting. No, they have a base right here.

290
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:55,400
This is where I can make it happen. Another tank. More tanks. Vehicle reporting. And another

291
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:07,800
turret too. Okay, let's go. Yes, sir. It's time to move. People are going to be one. Yes, sir.

292
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:26,099
Tanks are going to be two. Reporting. We're running out of time. Affirmative. Go. Affirmative.

293
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:56,309
Don't go in all the way. You only got like two health. How am I doing on money?

294
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:26,329
Kill it. Now they have a base. I might not be able to take the base out. That might be hard.

295
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:28,579
Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative.

296
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:32,179
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Be strategic about this.

297
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,539
What's up there? All right. They have... We're going to take out the...

298
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,119
Yes, sir. Affirmative. I need the tanks. Wait, let's wait. Let's take out their resources.

299
00:51:45,400 --> 00:52:06,300
Affirmative. Affirmative. Here comes the fight. Medic, get in there. Kill the snowplow.

300
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:34,119
Snowplow. I can't get in there with these guys. Yes. Don't go in too far. Don't go in too far.

301
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:41,610
Don't go too far. Yes, sir. All right. Take it out. Can you do it at range?

302
00:52:43,530 --> 00:53:04,469
Yeah. Oh, no. That's okay. Yes, sir. They're coming in from the stock. Acknowledged.

303
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:19,460
Give me another... Give me another barracks. Reporting. Affirmative. Affirmative. Oh,

304
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:55,900
shit. I'm out of power. This guy needs to up this game. More. Don't let up. Fuck this. That's

305
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:04,099
all they got. Go in. Go in with the tanks. Uh-oh. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back

306
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:13,449
it up. Yes, sir. That's bad. Just take it out. Take it out. Take it out. What else is up here?

307
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,170
Take out their flame shit and then I can have my infantry actually go in.

308
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:31,449
Affirmative. Crush. Crush. Crush. Oh, my God. Run them over. Run them over. Run them over.

309
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:49,579
Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need... Yes, sir. Affirmative.

310
00:54:49,579 --> 00:55:08,650
Waiting orders. Report. Very well. I'm going to run out of resources in a minute.

311
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:29,139
There's no more gold to get. It's only over here. I need money. Dick. Yes, sir. I need to expand.

312
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:34,780
Uh, I can't expand because I don't have... I can't... There's no more... There's no construction

313
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:45,349
yard. I just have to win. Agree. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm slowly taking out this shit.

314
00:55:46,150 --> 00:56:01,639
They don't have much up there. Thank God. Go. Affirmative. I need to make an ore refinery

315
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:10,119
like over here. Affirmative. Shit. What... Okay. What's absolutely... This is not necessary.

316
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:17,110
More tanks. I need more tanks. Reporting. I need to spend the money on the tanks. I can't

317
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:26,519
have a second ore factory. Ready and waiting. Acknowledged. Affirmative. Affirmative.

318
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,019
Okay. They have one tank and like... Yeah, this is over. I win. Just don't go in yet.

319
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:43,659
Yes, sir. Acknowledged. Sit on their ore field and just keep killing the snowplow.

320
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:50,219
All right. What needs to happen is I got to take out this, take out the tank,

321
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:57,449
and then I should win. Here we go. With the tanks. All right. They're just... Why are you going that

322
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:25,480
way? No. Go. Damn it. He killed the damn thing. No. You motherfucker. You dug the snowplow. He

323
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:38,019
knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing. Send him in. Send him in. Send him in. Everybody.

324
00:57:38,659 --> 00:58:01,139
Go. Go. Go. Go. Who's left? Oh, shit. Affirmative. Don't get in range of that. I can do this with one

325
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:34,260
tank. Take out the barracks. Yeah. Oh, spam. What the fuck is he made out of? Oh, my God.

326
00:58:44,019 --> 00:59:04,039
Kill him. You build a flame tank. Don't let him rebuild. Go up here.

327
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,199
Affirmative. No, no, no. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Don't go that way. All right. Here we go.

328
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,739
Unable to comply. Building in progress.

329
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,869
Air field?

330
00:59:44,940 --> 01:00:03,500
Build some barracks. God damn it, man. Just go up. Take out the silos. You're on run-over duty.

331
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:12,489
Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir.

332
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:16,809
Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Very well. Very well. Don't get in range of that.

333
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:26,199
Uh-oh. Here comes snowplow. Don't let him run you over. Don't let him get... All right. Good.

334
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:31,239
Take out the construction yard. Where did you get a tank?

335
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:55,420
Affirmative. Kill him. Yes. Why are you going up there?

336
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:02,179
They can't build buildings anymore. I win. Of course. Affirmative. Agreed. Agreed.

337
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:04,340
Very well. Reporting. Acknowledge. All right. Hold back for a second.

338
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:14,150
Affirmative. Affirmative. Vehicle reporting. Affirmative. Affirmative.

339
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:22,199
He's going to run in front of you. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Acknowledge.

340
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:33,849
Affirmative. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. He's going to kill it, isn't he?

341
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:37,610
Affirmative. Acknowledge. Reporting. Acknowledge. No. Run him over.

342
01:01:53,050 --> 01:02:02,980
You literally cannot win. I win. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Acknowledge.

343
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:09,030
All right. Yeah, it's over. I win. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

344
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:21,510
Literally. Yeah, at this point, this is annoying.

345
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,829
Why are you still in the game, man? Like, you're going to ride this. It's over. You lost.

346
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:31,579
You're going to stay in the game. I have to go around and find the one farm that you built.

347
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:39,420
To BM the game. Yes, sir. Affirmative. How do you still have money to do this?

348
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:58,940
Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

349
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,739
Don't cross the space path. Don't do that.

350
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:21,139
Thank god. Yes, sir. Kill them buildings. Just kill them buildings. It's over.

351
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:44,539
The germ is gaming hard right now. Yeah, I know. I gotta turn this down. This shit is so loud.

352
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:58,659
Okay, that's better. Did he just sell everything? Yes, sir. All right. This motherfucker is

353
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:01,780
seriously BMing me. He sold everything. Affirmative. He sold every building.

354
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:12,539
Very well. And you just left with a snowplow. Affirmative. Yes, sir. At once. Affirmative.

355
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:20,760
Is that actually all that you have left? Affirmative. Here it comes. The final battle.

356
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:37,670
Ready and waiting. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This is the last line of defense in the war.

357
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:50,730
You know you're in the snowplow. Like, what do you do? Snowplow BM. Yeah, I know. What the fuck?

358
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:08,039
I guess I did that.

359
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:32,469
This game. I love this game. 157 to 120. What building did I lose? I lost a building?

360
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:45,860
This one's into, we're going into Russia. Not quite. Let's go. Let's go up here.

361
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:51,139
Government leaders have abandoned the capital and are now hiding in exile. Information out of

362
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:56,340
occupied Athens has been sporadic, but Soviet forces are indeed in control of the capital,

363
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:01,940
as well as much of the outlying territories in Greece. In the city, fighting among allied

364
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:07,619
and Soviet troops continues, but the allied death toll is rising rapidly. Now it remains to be seen

365
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:12,099
if allied forces will be able to weather this onslaught intact. What the fuck? Reacting to

366
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:19,219
this latest assault, allied diplomats led the United Nations in a 281 to 7 vote that in approving

367
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:25,380
a unique military funding initiative aimed at increasing global allied support. This proposal

368
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,579
calls for the formation of a global defense agency to be temporarily established in an

369
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:43,800
unnamed European capital. Sounds bad, does it not? Well, it is, but Stalin has just written his

370
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:51,320
obituary. At last, this will help us galvanize the rest of the world against him. Yes, we have lost

371
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:58,280
Greece, but we are not out just yet. We've lost Greece. Stalin may think so, but if we can continue

372
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,320
to counsel the talents of commanders like yourself, we will come to this war on top.

373
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:17,019
My old friend, one of Tanya's men, she found something. Russian security agents have captured

374
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:26,090
her. They will almost certainly take her back to Moscow. They must get her back. She has vital

375
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:30,010
information on the Ion Breton project. Did you hear when he put it down? That information could

376
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:40,650
help tip the scales in our favor. Let him clear his head. In this state, he is of no use to us.

377
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:51,320
The Soviets currently hold Tanya near Grodno. The prison is well guarded with a supply truck from

378
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:58,329
a nearby Soviet base, runs through the facility several times a day. If your spies can infiltrate

379
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:05,420
the war factory, they may be able to hitch a ride into the prison compound. Once you have found Tanya,

380
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:29,130
get her out of there, any way you can. Such a pretty face. Where is Professor Einstein?

381
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:51,029
That was a real spin. I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, fuck. Oh, it's a syringe. What,

382
01:08:51,029 --> 01:09:01,560
what is it blood? What is that syringe? It has to be a syringe in every game.

383
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:24,659
I'm afraid the effects are quite permanent. Oh, get it away from the eye. Oh, I hate this. Oh,

384
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:41,850
I hate this. Oh, is he stuck in his chest? Wait, wait, what?

385
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:53,979
Let's go get spy into the war factory. War factory over here.

386
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:07,939
The dogs can see through. Oh shit. Oh shit, a dog is chasing me. The dogs can see through

387
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:30,310
your disguise. I remember. All right, get out of the way. Got to get in here. Watch out for that

388
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:35,350
dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for the dog.

389
01:10:36,869 --> 01:11:00,279
What? Didn't I just die? Didn't, what about, didn't that guy just die?

390
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:22,149
All right, I gotta wait. I gotta go like now, but I can't. I gotta wait. This is Hitman.

391
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:28,630
I gotta play it like Hitman. Okay, there they go. They're going to come up here. How far out do

392
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:56,710
these guys go? Maybe I should go down. They're not going to see me, right? I'm going down. Look

393
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:59,430
at that mammoth tank. That's the best, that's the best unit in the whole game, by the way.

394
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:14,939
All right, don't, I'm not, just stay here. Just stay, stay right here. They come up,

395
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:17,340
they come down, then they go this way and I'm going to go over here.

396
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:29,529
Save it right here. All right, I'm ready. Up and then they come back down. Hide up here.

397
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:38,439
Stay right there. They don't, please don't see me. Right? I'm far enough away. Okay.

398
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:44,069
Don't move. They go down. Okay, they go down there.

399
01:12:44,069 --> 01:13:11,930
Get in there. I'm in. Now what? Oh, I'm in the convoy. Oh, shit. Save it here.

400
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:37,909
This base is huge. Christ. Get Tanya to the helicopter.

401
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:58,739
Destroy the SAM sites. Let's go. Tanya? What happened to the spy? Oh no, the spy is dead.

402
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:16,310
Destroy the SAM sites. Get Tanya to the helicopter. And he gave, it gave his life.

403
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:20,619
All right, I gotta be careful. The dogs can kill you in instant one hit. So

404
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:40,119
there's another dog. Not so far so good. Helicopters. I don't even know where it is.

405
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:58,920
Hold up. Shoot. What the fuck? It was obvious. He was a red spy.

406
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:23,699
That's very good use of what he just said. Oh shit. Is that me? I'm getting reinforcements.

407
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:41,050
No, that, just get in the helicopter. Did I do it? Destroy all units and structures.

408
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:54,949
How the hell am I going to do this? I don't even need a construction site?

409
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,729
All right, I have to get an engineer into their construction site here.

410
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:15,079
This is gonna be fucked up. All right, I need to, we gotta do some group dictates and stuff here.

411
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:26,489
I want tanks on group one and I want jeeps and people on group two. Group one. Get you guys on

412
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:33,609
group two. All right, group one goes in first. That's a mammoth tank.

413
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:40,170
Let's try to take it out before I can do anything. Kill that mammoth tank.

414
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:59,050
Oh fuck. Kill it. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Only group one. They got dogs.

415
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:09,619
All right, engineer. Get in there. Take over the base and then I'll have a construction site.

416
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:17,449
If you get an engineer in any building, they take it over. That's not true. That's not true at all.

417
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:28,170
Oh right, right. You have to damage it. You have to damage it all the way.

418
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:36,949
Okay, whatever. We lost him. It has to be all the way on this damage. He's fixing it from the inside.

419
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:57,109
What are you doing? Stop it. Now it's ours. Okay, now I'll fix that. There we go. Now I own this shit.

420
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:09,590
Okay, I whoops. Okay, whoops. That was a whoops. I didn't capture the war factory. That was a mistake.

421
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:24,500
It's okay. I'm gonna make a sub pen. Shit, this is bad. What are you doing? Don't destroy your own

422
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:47,720
fence, you idiot. Don't. Actually, don't. Take out there. Take this up. Dog. Nobody get yourself

423
01:18:47,720 --> 01:19:00,840
killed, please. Sub pens going in here and then I can probably go around. We'll find out. Warfare.

424
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:14,859
Sub pen. Let's do it. I need an engineer. I wonder if I can make engineers. Get out. Get out. Get out.

425
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:30,439
Get out. Affirmative. Affirmative. All right, let's do a submarine. Wait a minute. Hold on.

426
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:45,770
Does the water go down here? Stay up here. Stay up here. Don't go down that way. Did I just waste

427
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:59,479
like a thousand? I think I just wasted a bunch of money. No, it's good. It goes. Yeah, I wasted

428
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:11,060
a bunch of money. Oh well. Oh well. Barracks. Let's get this ready. Let's do this like down here.

429
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:18,779
Engineer. Here we go. This stuff is all mine now. All mine. In fact, get everybody out of the way

430
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:46,470
and blow this up. Sell it. Destroy everything. I will. Did you seriously kill him? No. No.

431
01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:57,529
It didn't hit him? All right, I need to repair you. Come here. How do we repair?

432
01:20:57,529 --> 01:21:03,369
Come here. Did the fucking service depot just exploded? God damn it.

433
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:18,390
Oh shit. They're coming in. I think I'm gonna lose. I think he's gonna lose. I'm gonna lose. Oh my

434
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:32,340
God. No. No. When did I last save it? When did I save it? God damn it. When did I save it? Just

435
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:38,039
load it. I don't care. Okay. Yeah. What a disaster that was. We're not fucking doing that.

436
01:21:38,520 --> 01:22:01,260
Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Let's kill the tank. Get out of there,

437
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:13,350
Engineer. You seriously can't hit the dog. How bad are you guys? All right, we're good. Now.

438
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:22,739
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs.

439
01:22:26,569 --> 01:23:04,390
Don't turn yellow. Don't turn yellow. Don't turn yellow. Good. Why are the engineers on the front

440
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:15,529
line? I don't know. But I have to get them out quick now. Engineer. Hurry up so I can get this

441
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:28,329
done. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's take the service depot first. Oh my God.

442
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:34,979
I didn't think it was gonna destroy the whole thing. It did get killed instantly. I thought

443
01:23:34,979 --> 01:24:01,859
I was gonna at least... There was three barrels. Get in there. Stop shooting it. No,

444
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:12,010
fuck the ore refinery. Give me another barracks. Okay, I need engineers. Give me another barracks.

445
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:28,630
Capture the snowplow. I can't. Grenade? A Grenader. What's he doing? Get the fuck out of here.

446
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:39,060
Affirmative. Yes, sir. Knowledge. Get on the... Just defend. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Vehicle. Affirmative.

447
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,899
Give me another barracks. No, that's overkill. Super overkill. Yes, sir.

448
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:55,289
Stop. Stop. Don't go that far. What are you doing? Okay. Yes, sir. Affirmative.

449
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:16,100
Don't. Just go attack it. That's bad of you. Oh, yeah. You can repair. Right. Right. Right.

450
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:20,579
That's instant repair. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Yes, sir. I don't even want this one.

451
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:28,390
I'm not gonna take it over. I'll just replace it. It's probably cheaper for me to replace this.

452
01:25:42,260 --> 01:26:10,739
Let's get dogs. I'm gonna get like 50 dogs. More. I need money. I need money. I need money. I need

453
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:28,779
I need money. Don't do that. I don't have refinery. Okay. That's so many dog kennels. So,

454
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:35,029
plan A is see if I can wrap around this way to take out... Because these Tesla coils,

455
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:43,899
the flame tower, it's gonna be a shit show. Affirmative. I still have... All right. We got

456
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:52,300
dogs. Okay. Plan B is go... Oh, they have those things. What is it? The V rockets.

457
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:58,180
Just go wrap Main Streets the other way. But that's a horrible idea. I'm gonna go...

458
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,489
You know what? The transport actually doesn't sound like such a terrible idea now.

459
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:06,489
Because I could just put people in them and then bring them down here without...

460
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:11,130
No, what a mistake that was. All right. This guy's almost dead. Go scout over here. See what's over

461
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:24,600
here. Go to these so you don't get killed. All right. Go this way. No, no, no, no, no.

462
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:38,979
I can... I can admit it here. I could just launch a... I'm going for it. He sees me. He sees me. Come

463
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:51,100
on. Get it done. Get it done. Yes. Mission complete. You did a good job. It's all right.

464
01:27:51,100 --> 01:28:05,819
Here comes the retaliation. That's fine with me. Oh, fuck. Here come the rockets. Bad, bad, bad.

465
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:10,520
These things kill everything. Kill these before they do anything. Don't get too close.

466
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:27,909
Back it up. Okay. We're all right. Yes, sir. I gotta take off those fucking Tesla coils.

467
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:50,279
Of course. Agree. Kill it. Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back. I don't have the

468
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:58,600
power to do this. I gotta go around this way. In fact, you know what? Just get over here. Get

469
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:07,619
this way. Don't activate the Tesla coil. Just wrap around it. Because we're going down. These flame

470
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:21,659
towers are not as deadly as the Tesla coils. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Get in.

471
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:33,529
Oh, fuck. All the dogs just died. I didn't even realize they were here.

472
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:54,649
Where are you going? Just get across the bridge. What the fuck are you going? I think I'm gonna

473
01:29:54,649 --> 01:30:23,750
go all the way around a long way. That should be good. We're good. Why did he explode?

474
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:31,800
Yes, sir. Stay in the base. These guys are just gonna be painting the ass.

475
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:49,960
It's all right. These guys are flamethrower troopers. Oh, shit. Yes, sir. All right. Slowly

476
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:56,279
take them out. Take out their resources. Take out their bullshit. Power. Focus on that first.

477
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:20,779
Out of money. All right. I did what I wanted to do. More power. Take it out. I got an ore

478
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:25,340
truck, right? Yes, sir. Get over there. Affirmative. Where's my other? Okay. Good.

479
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,939
You're good. You're good. You're good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Don't leave the base unguarded.

480
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:40,100
Okay. Good. I got to take out this thing, but I don't want to. These are all grenades. Fuck.

481
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:49,109
I have no money. How much is 1400 bucks? Give me another tank. Two tanks.

482
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:02,899
All right. The grenades are actually awesome. They have. Don't run them over.

483
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:08,710
Okay. Do they have enough power to use the Tesla coil? Hello. What the hell was that?

484
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:21,369
What's going on? All right. I need to do a test. Ready and waiting. No, don't do that. That's a bad

485
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:47,560
idea. What happened to the music? The lack of music. Who is being shot at down here? All right.

486
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:54,359
This is freaking me out. Oh, they have a plane. It's planes. They're just doing these. Oh,

487
01:32:54,359 --> 01:33:11,460
that's not good. That's a pain in the ass. I need a. Give me a silo. No music makes it serious.

488
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:27,289
It is serious. No, they have power. Oh shit. That's bad. That's very bad. Kill it. Kill it

489
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:43,779
before it. I get it. We're doing tanks only. I need just only tanks. In fact, where are the

490
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:55,270
other resources down here? This shit. Get away from me. Oh, you fucking motherfucker. I'm so angry

491
01:33:55,270 --> 01:34:04,180
at that. Only tanks. Tanks only. Let's go. Those anti-infantry things. All right. Keep going.

492
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:11,479
Another war factory. So this goes faster. This will be worth it. I'm rolling with tanks.

493
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:24,810
I actually probably can do some. I'm not going to do it, but I probably could take out some more

494
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:33,449
shit down here. Make a radar dome. I will after the second war factory. You're not even doing

495
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:42,279
it. You're just being annoying. You're not even doing anything. Bad strategist. Yeah, I know. I'm

496
01:34:42,279 --> 01:34:48,739
pretty bad. So you can build your own rocket trucks. Can I? I don't think I can do that. Can

497
01:34:48,739 --> 01:35:02,390
I do that? Oh no, that's right. This is a, this is Soviet, right? Yeah. Okay. Now that's better.

498
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:30,550
Let's make a bunch of light tanks. Yes, sir. Acknowledge. Affirmative. Kill it. Okay. Radar

499
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:42,779
dome. It's a thousand bucks. I need another ore truck. They're almost, they almost have all the

500
01:35:42,859 --> 01:35:59,859
ore. And then they're dead because the only other ore is over here. Okay. I think it's worth,

501
01:35:59,859 --> 01:36:05,430
I think I'm done. Affirmative. I have a lot of tanks. They don't have that. I need to have these

502
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:14,890
rocket things, but shit. I'm out of resources. Take out this snowplow.

503
01:36:16,569 --> 01:36:33,590
Yes, sir. Kill this thing. Just kill it. Yes, sir. Get the Tesla coils. Get them. Hurry. I'm dead.

504
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:43,829
I was, I just like aggroed everything. That was to kill one Tesla coil. Um, it's over. I'm dead.

505
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:58,600
I don't have any money. I have zero dollars now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. At least the Tesla coil is

506
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:10,699
gone. So this thing can actually ore. You guys are such a pain in the ass. This is what happens

507
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:20,859
when you fight mighty Russia. Yes, sir. Kill the harvester. I can't. If I do that, I aggro the whole

508
01:37:20,859 --> 01:37:38,149
camp and they have a rocket guy right here. I'm so screwed. Not so mighty. I would just take the

509
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:44,390
bridge up, but I need to use this bridge. I'm going to park my guys here. Yes, sir. Or a truck.

510
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:51,289
Hurry up. I couldn't, I can destroy the bridge, but I don't want to go down here. I'd like to

511
01:37:51,289 --> 01:37:55,770
keep going through here. All right. Make this thing's life a living hell. Cut them off.

512
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:04,939
Okay. You're harassing me. Stop it.

513
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:15,380
Kill the bridge. Not yet. I need this bridge. Wait, destroy the bridge and then put transport,

514
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:30,819
get transports. That's a great idea. Actually. How can you guys suck that much that you can't

515
01:38:30,819 --> 01:38:36,979
shoot that one? Yes, sir. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's go destroy it. Cut off the resources. That's

516
01:38:36,979 --> 01:38:58,979
completely. Can I? Yup. Do it. You ain't got shit now. Do it. Kill it. You're not going to let

517
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:11,420
this little shit kill you, are you? Okay. I have two ore trucks. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

518
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:20,439
no. God damn it. Why didn't it get destroyed? And now here, this thing's going to stay. And now I

519
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:31,939
have no money. Ah, I'm going to eat up every resource. Why did this bridge not get destroyed?

520
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:44,439
Let me do my stupid thing. Do I need, I need to know. No, I don't.

521
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:58,619
Every tank versus every tank. Yes, sir. I got the jump on him. I got the first shot. I win.

522
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:34,899
I think I might have to restart. I have to restart. I'm not going to have enough money to do this.

523
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:41,449
I shouldn't have even made this. You know what happened? It's when I destroyed the service depot

524
01:40:41,449 --> 01:41:13,109
that fucking tanks the whole game. I might still, I might be all right.

525
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:22,979
Actually don't even destroy the bridge. This thing is so fucking annoying. It does not have the toys.

526
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:46,550
What do they have? Just drown them. All right. Fucked up their resources.

527
01:41:50,680 --> 01:42:02,840
Nice miss idiot. They have so much shit over here.

528
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,960
Now pull it back. Pull it back. Pull it back. Pull it back. Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm just

529
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:27,800
trying to just lead them out there resources. Take their refinery. They don't have it. That's

530
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:35,619
all right. They don't have trucks. Here comes a truck and it's dead. Control supply and you

531
01:42:35,619 --> 01:42:47,020
won't have to worry. Control supply. They're not going to have any money left. Yes, sir.

532
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:58,420
You're really going to let that happen. You destroyed. I needed that. Oh my God.

533
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:21,140
Let's kill it. Where do you think it's going? You can't go over here. Oh, it has to go all

534
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:26,489
the way around. Now check this out. I'm going to make turrets. Don't aggro everybody.

535
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:42,460
Man, I'm so angry right now. The stupid ass V2 rocket blew the bridge up and it fucked up

536
01:43:42,460 --> 01:44:06,810
my whole plan. How is this still alive? What? Yes, sir. Kill it. I have to go in the front

537
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:21,989
goddamn door. Shit. I got to take out everything. I need. I need. Okay. That thing. Every time I hear

538
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:33,430
that noise, I get fucking mad. What do I, I need money. They have more than me. They don't have

539
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:38,899
any money though. So just keep, just bleed them out completely. Can I make Sam sites? Not yet.

540
01:44:38,899 --> 01:44:53,130
Let me make a radar. They're not going to attack. These guys sucks. Imagine getting stabbed. What?

541
01:44:53,130 --> 01:45:01,340
The plane attacks cost them nothing. Okay. Good. Well, here comes another truck that thinks it's

542
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:20,329
going to actually do anything over here. It's not. Just wait. Okay. V2 rocket. Make one.

543
01:45:31,579 --> 01:45:34,300
All right. Good luck ever having any money ever again.

544
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:40,579
I think I can actually reach the, yeah, let me, I'm going to get two of these.

545
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,699
I'm going to take out the Tesla coil in one shot.

546
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:55,159
Yes, sir. These things are just smoking. Okay. Yes, sir. I got two V2 rockets. I got a bunch of tanks.

547
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:02,739
Not quite ready. I will be very soon. Let's get some infantry. Yes, sir.

548
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:20,890
Knowledge. Okay. I can't. Okay. Now let's get like 10. I missed the spy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

549
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:24,489
All right. Here comes the truck. Good luck. You ain't going to get over here.

550
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:32,659
Got some infantry. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Okay. All right. I'm, I'm going for it. I'm going to

551
01:46:32,659 --> 01:46:37,699
go for it. We're going to test the coil, kill Tesla coil, save it right here. Say this is something

552
01:46:37,699 --> 01:46:53,239
else. Cause yeah, watch this shit. Yes, sir. Why would you shoot? You're not even shooting

553
01:46:53,239 --> 01:47:00,039
at anything. I need those rockets loaded for when I take out the. Yes, sir. Very well.

554
01:47:08,899 --> 01:47:14,409
These two V2 rockets have to shoot this and kill it. All right. I'm going one more heavy tank. I'm

555
01:47:14,409 --> 01:47:31,050
going to game over. Here it goes. I'm ready for this. V2 rockets. Here we go. Yes, sir.

556
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:41,859
Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you

557
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:53,079

558
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:17,960
All right. All right. All right. All right. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it comes. Here it

560
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:26,060

561
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:47,090
about who cares everything else fine go get it that's it game over I win all

562
01:49:47,090 --> 01:50:00,100

563
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:10,119
let up don't let up power get rid of power make a Sam site I can't even make

564
01:50:10,119 --> 01:50:51,939
it sit no I win I'm so glad I did the bleed him dry tactic an airfield I mean

565
01:50:51,939 --> 01:51:05,399
that got this in the back actually no I don't that's not confirmed silos do it

566
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:20,109
no I don't even need a silo it took 75 minutes it did not take 75 minutes it

567
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:23,710
didn't take 75 minutes I've only been screaming for two hours it didn't take

568
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:30,239
it didn't take no it did not it did not take 75 minutes no it did not I refuse

569
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:46,710
to believe that it didn't take 75 minutes all right this thing's all that

570
01:51:46,710 --> 01:52:02,279
he's in denial he's serious would you get the money to build this he's in

571
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:10,500
denial it did not take that long to build this it didn't take that long

572
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:23,250
get everybody in the right spot okay cool take it off see that's the play

573
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:46,819
as you sell it before it gets destroyed you'll never take me alive

574
01:52:46,819 --> 01:53:02,069
the Soviet base is dumb and thick I don't know why I read that I don't know why do

575
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:13,500
I read anything what trucks oh you mean coming yeah let's go

576
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:53,739
faces huge what a giant-ass face go that's it some of you go this way haha

577
01:53:53,739 --> 01:54:21,659
haha no I have to kill these go over there and deal with that you guys take

578
01:54:21,859 --> 01:54:46,890
now it's the kill kill every unit yuck that was technically a unit Tanya's safe

579
01:54:46,890 --> 01:55:03,529
you can go home did we hit 80 minutes I'm about to go look at the bond I'm

580
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:19,210
going to my bod right now and I'm gonna see that they're not even fighting back

581
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:32,430
I thought we got Tanya out wait would Titania not get out so very pretty but

582
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:59,390
also stubborn wait oh that's me that's the spy they get cut off so quickly I

583
01:55:59,829 --> 01:56:21,500
want to see what happens one hour and 18 minutes no it hasn't but I I read that

584
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:27,029
was a hard mission but remember that was I had to like infiltrate the base and

585
01:56:27,029 --> 01:56:32,300
escape with Tanya that's also included in that time that was two different

586
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:41,939
missions together I'm going down excellent work commander the information

587
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:49,579
recovered has proved invaluable would you not agree this is on normal normal

588
01:56:49,579 --> 01:57:00,149
yes our analysis is almost come no no no sit sit I'm late I apologize

589
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:08,300
Albert Einstein is not working professor Einstein this is an honor

590
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:13,779
general Nikos Davros professor let me introduce the commander who rescued you

591
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:17,420
this is the only clothes that Albert Einstein ever wore apparently this

592
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:24,140
professor Albert Einstein yes very exciting he's always in this like I'm

593
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:31,039
in my brown vest and brown jacket these are reconnaissance photos there are no

594
01:57:31,039 --> 01:57:36,399
photos of him see in pajamas professor perhaps you can help us identify the

595
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:44,329
specifics from what I've had a chance to read this is Stalin's main research

596
01:57:44,409 --> 01:57:54,149
laboratory why would they be they are working on a new kind of defense he

597
01:57:54,149 --> 01:58:00,189
doesn't look like this is it it's just messy bald gray head with mustache is

598
01:58:00,189 --> 01:58:07,270
based on the theory of resonating molecules a sure yes professor but what

599
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:14,390
does the Iron Curtain do do well by the theorem it appears to make things

600
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:21,689
invulnerable any vehicle or structure covered with this effect this guy's

601
01:58:21,689 --> 01:58:29,409
idea now will be impervious to harm yes Albert Einstein is dead yes I know

602
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:36,340
Tesla was experimenting with this kind of professor that is all we need to know

603
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:43,039
Soviet research on this device cannot be allowed to continue destroy it what else

604
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:49,439
do we know about this research he's not talking he just runs away put your

605
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:56,039
personal losses aside from a reveal yes of course besides R&D functions this

606
01:58:56,039 --> 01:59:00,920
base also serves as a waypoint for Soviet submarine actions so it's

607
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,640
heavily populated as far as we can tell the only prototype they have of this

608
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:12,079
Iron Curtain is located here we do not know if it is operational yet commander

609
01:59:12,119 --> 01:59:19,000
your task is simple get into that base infiltrate their laboratories and

610
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:27,880
destroy all information and prototypes of this Iron Curtain

611
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:36,739
this is one of the harder missions I looked up I saw it on the on the

612
01:59:36,739 --> 01:59:44,840
Wikipedia it said this is the mission that's very hard let's make this good

613
01:59:44,880 --> 02:00:04,109
okay go get it going all right before I do anything is there actually an attack

614
02:00:04,109 --> 02:00:10,319
move because I can't seem to get it to work I don't think there is not what is

615
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:17,819
it no you can just move them where you want and then press G to put them on

616
02:00:17,819 --> 02:00:25,500
area guard okay so it's G you just have to move him somewhere press G there is

617
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:29,659
no attack move in red alert yeah like that's all I needed now so just be G go

618
02:00:29,659 --> 02:00:37,880
okay in fact you know just stop moving stop moving up get up there start

619
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:59,840
scouting G how big is this map pretty big take it out don't get in range of

620
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:11,989
them G don't sneak up there stay back how we doing refinery get it up radar

621
02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:22,229
don't worry don't don't don't attack don't die you idiot sorry no no no no

622
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:31,369
it's just guarding G scout this way this is a GTA 5 sized map there are some maps

623
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:35,279
in this game that are huge they can have up to eight players play them that was a

624
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:51,100
spy plane I got a set to build up I don't have very much room all right power

625
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:55,119
plant I don't have any room I'm out of room I don't have any room I don't have any room to build

626
02:01:55,119 --> 02:02:13,920
oh shit this is bad okay I need a barracks stay here and guard stay back

627
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:33,569
you guys up front G oh shit get over moving and shoot what are you doing why

628
02:02:33,569 --> 02:03:04,029
did you do this oh fuck this is very bad I have no room spy oh fuck spy get in

629
02:03:04,029 --> 02:03:15,289
there I need rocket soldiers to prevent that from happening why did I just make

630
02:03:15,289 --> 02:03:31,390
two spies I just panicked it I don't know why I did that these guys over here

631
02:03:31,390 --> 02:03:38,920
all right one of you guys will get this done I have to infiltrate what the iron

632
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:49,020
curtain good nothing can get over good okay stop that get regular inventory

633
02:03:49,020 --> 02:04:24,460
what do I need to do all the Grenada's bad what do I need to infiltrate I just

634
02:04:24,539 --> 02:04:42,939
keep coming in I don't even build anything I mean what was it I'm dead I

635
02:04:42,939 --> 02:04:47,020
I needed to have turrets and pillboxes from the very beginning otherwise you

636
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:54,539
guaranteed to lose enemy tech center that's not up there all right I'm dead

637
02:04:54,539 --> 02:05:05,159
it's over that's all so this fucking redo it again retry fishing all right you

around what are you dumb

641
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:52,529
yes okay don't hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry move your MCV past the base

642
02:05:52,529 --> 02:05:55,689
because I don't know if they have up here they might kill it before it gets

643
02:05:55,689 --> 02:06:10,029
up there wait let me check that if we go up here and kill this shit let me see

644
02:06:10,029 --> 02:06:14,880

650
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:49,750
recently did you just see useless over here why am I not making buildings

673
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:42,989
an engineer or two I'm gonna steal some stuff so I can continue to build in fact

674
02:12:42,989 --> 02:13:06,810
let's go hold on hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up tanks what do they got

675

Oh, it's got zap.

03:45:27,500 --> 03:45:28,780
Take out the power, take out the power, quick,

1071
03:45:28,780 --> 03:45:48,690
take out the power.

1072
03:45:48,690 --> 03:45:51,750
I did it, it's over.

1073
03:45:51,750 --> 03:45:53,110
The Tesla coil is strong, yeah,

1074
03:45:53,110 --> 03:45:56,250
it's like the most destructive thing in the whole game.

1075
03:45:56,250 --> 03:46:23,500
There's so many.

1076
03:46:23,500 --> 03:46:30,399
There really are so many people.

1077
03:46:30,399 --> 03:46:31,739
Get rid of that thing.

1078
03:46:31,739 --> 03:46:35,100
Ooh, that took out a chunk.

1079
03:46:35,100 --> 03:46:36,940
That's a sizable chunk of every person.

1080
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:38,760
We're good.

1081
03:46:38,760 --> 03:46:51,649
Really?

1082
03:46:51,649 --> 03:46:52,649
That desperate?

1083
03:46:52,649 --> 03:47:02,889
You can drive around that thing.

1084
03:47:02,889 --> 03:47:08,350
Oh shit!

1085
03:47:08,350 --> 03:47:18,540
Why do they have power?

1086
03:47:18,540 --> 03:47:22,620
How do they have power for this?

1087
03:47:22,620 --> 03:47:23,620
Kill it!

1088
03:47:23,620 --> 03:47:24,620
Kill it!

1089
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:25,620
Kill it!

1090
03:47:25,620 --> 03:47:26,620
Kill it!

1091
03:47:26,620 --> 03:47:27,620
Kill the power!

1092
03:47:27,620 --> 03:47:33,780
Kill the power!

1093
03:47:33,979 --> 03:47:36,579
If you even two tesla coils can kill everybody here.

1094
03:47:36,579 --> 03:47:49,659
Take out the subpens.

1095
03:47:49,659 --> 03:47:50,659
I think I just did it.

1096
03:47:50,659 --> 03:47:56,379
Do they have more subpens?

1097
03:47:56,379 --> 03:48:05,370
Go with this.

1098
03:48:05,370 --> 03:48:06,370
Okay.

1099
03:48:06,370 --> 03:48:07,370
Done.

1100
03:48:07,370 --> 03:48:09,629
Where's the last subpen?

1101
03:48:09,629 --> 03:48:10,629
No more?

1102
03:48:10,629 --> 03:48:13,020
Up here.

1103
03:48:13,020 --> 03:48:44,920
What are you doing?

1104
03:48:44,920 --> 03:48:46,860
I saw...

1105
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:47,860
I saw my construction yard.

1106
03:48:47,860 --> 03:48:48,860
There's no money left anyway.

1107
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:49,860
I think I just did it.

1108
03:48:49,860 --> 03:48:54,100
I think I just did it.

1109
03:48:54,100 --> 03:48:55,100
I think I just did it.

1110
03:48:55,100 --> 03:49:01,840
I think I just did it.

1111
03:49:01,840 --> 03:49:02,840
I think I just did it.

1112
03:49:02,840 --> 03:49:03,840
I think I just did it.

1113
03:49:03,840 --> 03:49:04,840
I think I just did it.

1114
03:49:04,840 --> 03:49:05,840
I think I just did it.

1115
03:49:05,840 --> 03:49:11,510
I saw my construction yard.

1116
03:49:11,510 --> 03:49:14,110
There's no money left anyway.

1117
03:49:14,110 --> 03:49:21,260
I think I can kill them still.

1118
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:22,579
The artillery has a bunch of range.

1119
03:49:22,579 --> 03:49:24,579
They just can't go underwater or I'm softlocked.

1120
03:49:24,579 --> 03:49:36,120
There's a little bit of money left in their base.

1121
03:49:36,120 --> 03:49:37,120
Okay.

1122
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:38,120
Nobody fire yet.

1123
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:40,159
Seriously, nobody fire.

1124
03:49:40,159 --> 03:49:42,139
Do not fire.

1125
03:49:42,139 --> 03:49:45,500
I need to get all the artillery up here and fire at the exact same time and kill them

1126
03:49:45,500 --> 03:49:46,500
on hit.

1127
03:49:46,500 --> 03:49:47,500
Destroy subpens.

1128
03:49:47,500 --> 03:49:48,500
You idiot.

1129
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:49,500
Don't fire.

1130
03:49:49,500 --> 03:49:50,500
Don't.

1131
03:49:50,500 --> 03:49:51,500
I just told you not to fire.

1132
03:49:51,819 --> 03:49:53,340
Don't fire.

1133
03:49:53,340 --> 03:50:12,629
Don't fire.

1134
03:50:12,629 --> 03:50:14,430
Oh, you're going to ruin this whole thing.

1135
03:50:14,430 --> 03:50:16,700
Fire.

1136
03:50:16,700 --> 03:50:17,700
Come this way.

1137
03:50:17,700 --> 03:50:22,520
I hope this is it.

1138
03:50:22,520 --> 03:50:23,950
Affirmative.

1139
03:50:23,950 --> 03:50:24,950
Affirmative.

1140
03:50:24,950 --> 03:50:28,110
What's it?

1142
03:50:31,270 --> 03:50:33,920
Affirmative.

1143
03:50:33,920 --> 03:50:37,159

Affirmative.

1148
03:50:49,159 --> 03:50:58,700
Is there another sub over here?

1149
03:50:58,700 --> 03:51:01,860
Yes, sir.

1150
03:51:01,860 --> 03:51:05,899
Affirmative.

1151
03:51:05,899 --> 03:51:06,899
Yes, sir.

1152
03:51:06,899 --> 03:51:07,899
Oh, please tell me I can reach this.

1153
03:51:07,899 --> 03:51:17,440
I definitely can with the artillery. There's no way I can't reach that far

1154
03:52:13,620 --> 03:52:27,040
I can see you. It's the transport that has to be it, right? Yes. No, this is it

1155
03:52:39,639 --> 03:52:42,520
How many more are there

1156
03:52:47,200 --> 03:53:17,219
Come on you can get it. You can get it. There's one more. There's a bunch off shore

1157
03:53:25,409 --> 03:53:29,620
Oh

03:53:29,620 --> 03:53:33,649
No, how many are here? Oh

1159
03:53:37,959 --> 03:53:46,159
Are you serious? I can't know I can't build an A because I sold my construction yard

1160
03:53:59,319 --> 03:54:04,340
Come on, he's got a visit. They can't be much more than that. What about off the coast over here?

1161
03:54:04,579 --> 03:54:06,579
I'll try to go this way

1162
03:54:06,739 --> 03:54:12,600
Sell units and make a new yard. I I don't have that. I can't make a new yard

1163
03:54:13,459 --> 03:54:17,329
No, this is over

1164
03:54:17,329 --> 03:54:22,549
It's over. I actually have to either restart or like put a cheat code in

1165
03:54:24,590 --> 03:54:33,719
There's like a pen down here that I can't see

1166
03:54:34,680 --> 03:54:50,399
How do I cheat I didn't lose notice I won I did is there yes, sir

1167
03:54:50,920 --> 03:54:59,809
How do you was it a tilde shoot the trees?

Enter

1169
03:55:10,399 --> 03:55:16,940
Doesn't look like you won they're saying a PC is aquatic

1170
03:55:18,920 --> 03:55:20,920
There would be a PC what

1171
03:55:27,829 --> 03:55:31,729
Eight what what's aquatic?

1172
03:55:32,840 --> 03:55:35,370
I don't have any I don't have an APC

1173
03:55:36,250 --> 03:55:39,399
That's not aquatic

1174
03:55:39,399 --> 03:55:42,600
No, this thing's not aquatic guys

1175
03:55:45,930 --> 03:55:47,930
Sell and build an ore truck. I

1176
03:55:48,409 --> 03:55:50,409
Does not have anything to sell

1177
03:55:50,649 --> 03:55:52,959
You can't sell units

1178
03:55:53,200 --> 03:56:23,250
No, that's it. It's I lose your game. I can't I don't think I can no, I'm actually soft-locked

1179
03:56:23,250 --> 03:56:25,250
I can't beat this. I cannot win. Yeah

1180
03:56:26,409 --> 03:56:42,170
How far where is this? All right, this is it I'm still good

1181
03:56:43,069 --> 03:56:47,850
All right, go in go in right go in just kill everything quick

1182
03:56:48,510 --> 03:57:18,549
Go in the Tesla Tesla Tesla Tesla Tesla coil

1183
03:57:19,069 --> 03:57:41,530
This is your brain your brain is suffering

1184
03:57:43,170 --> 03:57:49,250
Okay, all right, here we go

1185
03:57:49,450 --> 03:57:52,770
I still have the naval yard. I'm still everything's good to go. We're gonna build

1186
03:57:53,610 --> 03:57:55,250
destroyers, no

1187
03:57:55,250 --> 03:57:56,770
gunboats I

1188
03:57:56,770 --> 03:57:59,909
Like ten of them. I feel like at least five of them

1189
03:58:03,159 --> 03:58:04,239
artillery

1190
03:58:04,239 --> 03:58:11,790
artillery and gunboats

1191
03:58:11,790 --> 03:58:25,520
I don't need that much artillery. I do need gunboats though. We're gonna do the same thing we did

1192
03:58:25,520 --> 03:58:27,520
We're gonna go in and we're gonna attack

1193
03:58:27,719 --> 03:58:35,309
We have to do this quickly though. Like for instance, I remember getting angry at this part right here

1194
03:58:35,309 --> 03:58:39,469
I got really fucking mad at this part because now I just remember I said this

1195
03:58:39,469 --> 03:58:43,229
Oh, I just moved him and all of a sudden now I remember I said that you remember that right?

1196
03:59:05,379 --> 03:59:11,700
Here we go

1197
03:59:12,819 --> 03:59:18,340
Get him in close and they'll take care of the rest no more gunboats after this

1198
03:59:24,239 --> 03:59:28,479
Each of you pick a spot for the love of God and now fire

1199
03:59:35,700 --> 03:59:38,639
Okay, stay there

1200
03:59:39,079 --> 03:59:41,079
Check it. I don't have any

1201
03:59:45,360 --> 03:59:50,760
Sell everything except the construction yard now, I don't do that yet

1202
03:59:54,440 --> 03:59:56,870
Let me take care of this first

1203
03:59:57,950 --> 04:00:15,879
I'm gonna do this first

1204
04:00:15,879 --> 04:00:20,799
Okay, there's no more money

1205
04:00:20,799 --> 04:00:24,799
It might be time to do everything except construction yard. I actually agree with you know

1206
04:00:25,879 --> 04:00:28,209
But not yet

1207
04:00:28,209 --> 04:00:32,440
Save it right before that happens. Oh

1208
04:00:40,159 --> 04:00:49,879
This many subs just sitting up here

1209
04:00:55,440 --> 04:01:08,040
Why do you have this many why are they over here? Why do you have this many submarines?

1210
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:41,729
Fuck is that?

1211
04:01:41,729 --> 04:01:44,159
All right, we have to go in now. We have to go in now

1212
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:59,770

1213
04:02:00,049 --> 04:02:13,870
I need power right now. Oh, wait, what what what what what what what what happened? That's all right. It'll build it'll build eventually. It's fine

1214
04:02:38,450 --> 04:02:41,409

1215
04:02:46,120 --> 04:02:51,950
I'm not bringing this

1216
04:02:52,549 --> 04:02:58,450
I'm not bringing the ore truck. I can't I need like one power

1217
04:02:59,329 --> 04:03:03,479
Keep the ore trucks cuz when I clear this

1218
04:03:05,159 --> 04:03:11,760
Kill this use your artillery in range

1219
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:27,920

What's the cheating bullshit that just happened right there? They got to two buildings at the same time

1225
04:04:21,329 --> 04:04:23,329
You can have two buildings building at the same time

1226
04:04:23,489 --> 04:04:26,489
So what wait? How are you building these this path?

1227
04:04:27,290 --> 04:04:29,200
What are you talking about?

1228
04:04:29,200 --> 04:04:52,399
That's on that's that's you literally cheating. It's still okay. It's not over yet

1229
04:04:53,120 --> 04:04:55,680
It actually might be alright

1243
04:08:52,969 --> 04:08:55,290

Bring me an engineer

1290
04:18:15,909 --> 04:18:20,510
Now I'm gonna build like 30 destroyers

1291
04:18:22,030 --> 04:18:32,719
Okay, I need a

1292
04:18:34,100 --> 04:18:42,190
Barracks and then I need to wait a minute. Hold on. I need to barracks and then sell

1293
04:18:43,129 --> 04:18:46,229
Okay barracks sell my refinery. Oh

1294
04:18:50,590 --> 04:18:52,590
Fuck I need power

1295
04:18:52,590 --> 04:19:31,319
How much am I gonna sell and then engineer steal their refinery? Why did I do that?

1296
04:19:31,739 --> 04:19:35,399
I'm gonna steal their refinery so I can get over here

1297
04:19:35,500 --> 04:19:41,340
Why did I do what do you mean? Well, I cuz they have to go a long way and I don't have any money

1298
04:19:41,340 --> 04:19:49,690
I can take them. Okay, just watch you'll see you'll get it. You'll get it cuz they're gonna go into deposit to this one

1299
04:19:50,250 --> 04:20:00,600
Don't worry. It's all part of the plan here because now I can just build a bunch of destroyers

1300
04:20:00,680 --> 04:20:03,799
Let's actually get one queued up. Wait, just make sure I'm not stupid

1301
04:20:06,360 --> 04:20:25,899
Are you actually repairing this you've just been in the lobby the whole time stop stop firing

1302
04:20:28,000 --> 04:20:29,479
Jesus man

1303
04:20:29,479 --> 04:20:35,299
Don't turn you don't turn don't turn

1304
04:20:35,860 --> 04:20:47,239
Yeah, okay. We're good. See then this is a much shorter trip

1305
04:20:48,079 --> 04:20:49,120
destroyers

1306
04:20:49,120 --> 04:20:51,860
Just only destroyers. That's it. Nothing else

1307
04:21:01,870 --> 04:21:06,649
I'm actually gonna go down here. Why is this guy so nutty me?

1308
04:21:08,250 --> 04:21:25,389
Yes, sir

1309
04:21:26,709 --> 04:21:28,709
Yeah, okay

1310
04:21:42,430 --> 04:21:44,430
Get this up and yes, sir

1311
04:21:48,709 --> 04:21:54,379
More destroyed how many do I need?

1312
04:21:54,700 --> 04:21:55,899
like ten

1313
04:21:55,899 --> 04:21:59,739
They probably have like one two, three, four five this one. Okay, I'm gonna guess

1314
04:22:00,399 --> 04:22:03,040
I'm gonna get six just stuffed up here in his closet

1315
04:22:03,680 --> 04:22:06,690
one two, three, four five six

1316
04:22:07,250 --> 04:22:22,260
So that means I have to go in with like ten

1317
04:22:24,120 --> 04:22:26,120
It takes 80 minutes per level

1318
04:22:26,440 --> 04:22:29,200
Yeah

1319
04:22:29,200 --> 04:22:35,920
This is a hard game. It's tricky and yeah, okay. Well, I'll level with you here. I will be fair. I

1320
04:22:37,319 --> 04:22:43,040
Don't RTS is not like the thing that I'm known for I'm made only I'm basically mostly known for

1321
04:22:43,760 --> 04:22:48,079
Beating the last boss in securo on stream in under 60 tries. That's what I'm known for

1322
04:22:48,239 --> 04:22:51,239
This is not what I'm known for. So I obviously not gonna be that great

1323
04:23:07,239 --> 04:23:14,620
If there's no way I lose I can't lose I actually cannot lose as long as I have

1324
04:23:17,200 --> 04:23:19,200
Look at how big this Navy is

1325
04:23:21,909 --> 04:23:23,270
I'll be ready

1326
04:23:23,270 --> 04:23:33,059
Wait, this guy actually beats the carol. Yep. I really did

1327
04:23:33,700 --> 04:23:37,920
All right. Is there anything else I should do?

1328
04:23:44,209 --> 04:23:46,209
How about a second naval you had to make this faster?

1329
04:23:47,520 --> 04:24:10,200
Yeah, this is plenty of money over here. Come on. Really? Is this too far away?

1330
04:24:14,709 --> 04:24:22,440
What what?

1331
04:24:28,530 --> 04:24:32,709
Power

1332
04:24:32,709 --> 04:24:34,709
Just capture the other refinery

1333
04:24:38,950 --> 04:24:41,510
Why did I do that? I why did I do that? I could have put it over

1334
04:24:42,389 --> 04:24:43,989
You know i'm known for

1335
04:24:43,989 --> 04:24:47,510
I used to do these things called tf2 live gameplay commentaries

1336
04:24:49,190 --> 04:24:53,030
And I used to play as certain characters like the spy and I would go for weapons

1337
04:24:59,969 --> 04:25:04,340
This has to be enough you know what I mean, seriously, this is

1338
04:25:04,899 --> 04:25:07,940
There's so many boats

1339
04:25:07,940 --> 04:25:09,940
This if this is not enough

1340
04:25:09,940 --> 04:25:11,940
Then I deserve to lose

1341
04:25:12,340 --> 04:25:22,309
Affirmative. Yes, sir. Acknowledge. Yes, sir. Let's go. Yes, sir. Affirmative

1342
04:25:26,360 --> 04:25:30,000
Acknowledged you have the tactical advantage

1343
04:25:31,569 --> 04:25:32,770
Not really

1344
04:25:32,770 --> 04:25:34,770
He has submarines. I don't know where they are

1345
04:25:35,170 --> 04:25:37,409
I mean they're here, but they could be anywhere

1346
04:25:38,110 --> 04:26:13,479
affirmative

1347
04:26:13,479 --> 04:26:23,569
guy

1348
04:26:23,649 --> 04:26:25,649
Fucking god, how many do you have acknowledged?

1349
04:26:30,260 --> 04:26:36,719
I know I have to destroy the sub pens. What do you think?

1350
04:26:44,639 --> 04:26:48,600
Acknowledge

1351
04:26:49,479 --> 04:26:54,530
All right, let's let's celebrate

1352
04:27:26,840 --> 04:27:32,360
Where where are the planes coming from ever cease fire cease fire cease fire cease fire

1353
04:27:32,920 --> 04:27:45,739
Cease fire. Where are the planes coming from? Yes, sir. Oh my god. You have so many submarines

1354
04:27:46,680 --> 04:27:48,680
Just get in

1355
04:27:49,969 --> 04:27:51,969
Where are the planes?

1356
04:27:56,020 --> 04:27:59,139
Is there a tiny island that he put a airstrip on

1357
04:28:11,170 --> 04:28:14,209
Where is that? You know what? Go look over here. I need to know

1358
04:28:17,329 --> 04:28:27,270
There's a tesla coil over here this guy these things are like 2,800 is like $3,000. Why is it over here?

1359
04:28:37,829 --> 04:28:40,129
Yes, sir, affirmative

1360
04:28:40,690 --> 04:28:43,559
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Acknowledged

1361
04:28:44,760 --> 04:28:47,719
Okay, there is no other area on this map

1362
04:28:49,659 --> 04:28:53,299
Where's the other airfield?

1363
04:28:53,299 --> 04:28:55,540
Affirmative that doesn't make any sense

1364
04:29:11,299 --> 04:29:33,959
Got it two hours

1365
04:29:34,120 --> 04:29:50,440
Whatever the game just crashed. I got the actual spinning death and the window came up that said

1366
04:29:51,159 --> 04:29:53,559
Uh, the program stopped responding but now it came back

1367
04:29:55,719 --> 04:30:00,659
Thank god

1368
04:30:00,659 --> 04:30:28,100
I uh left

1369
04:30:31,780 --> 04:30:33,780
I

1370
04:30:37,750 --> 04:30:42,299
Incredible we made it disappear and reappear

1371
04:30:43,819 --> 04:30:45,819
But with very little control

1372
04:30:46,780 --> 04:30:53,819
We lost some men, but do you have the control problem solved? That is the heart of the chronosphere project

1373
04:30:55,180 --> 04:30:57,659
Charging this is where you come in

1374
04:30:58,459 --> 04:31:00,299
I wanted you to see this

1375
04:31:00,379 --> 04:31:02,860
She understands the importance of your next mission

1376
04:31:07,219 --> 04:31:09,780
He still the clonosphere is being tested here

1377
04:31:10,500 --> 04:31:12,579
At our research center outside like

1378
04:31:13,559 --> 04:31:19,079
The soviets recently learned of its location and have begun bombing it regularly

1379
04:31:19,879 --> 04:31:22,040
You must protect this research site

1380
04:31:23,299 --> 04:31:28,979
And the scientists working inside get to the base immediately and fortify it

1381
04:31:29,620 --> 04:31:31,620
we would evacuate the base but

1382
04:31:32,500 --> 04:31:34,739
Months of preparation would be wasted

1383
04:31:35,540 --> 04:31:41,780
The buildings and their contents must remain operational until the experiment is complete

1384
04:31:42,260 --> 04:31:46,870
So I have to defend against probably waves

1385
04:31:47,350 --> 04:31:54,139
But I say it was like

1386
04:31:55,020 --> 04:31:57,020
Of a a guns

1387
04:32:02,979 --> 04:32:08,549
I don't even have a

1388
04:32:08,549 --> 04:32:10,549
All right. This is the base. What is that?

1389
04:32:10,709 --> 04:32:15,350
This is the chronosphere. Yes, sir. Okay. All right, go go go go. What am I doing? Go go. I didn't go

1390
04:32:15,670 --> 04:32:17,670
What do I need to go go go?

1391
04:32:20,819 --> 04:33:20,470
What's where are they attacking get down there I could I could just build it over here though

1392
04:33:32,500 --> 04:33:34,500
Get in reporting

1393
04:33:34,580 --> 04:33:37,400
That's the definition of a bad idea

1394
04:33:38,200 --> 04:33:41,479
It's all right. I made it that was just to get the escort over here. That's it

1395
04:33:43,880 --> 04:33:47,959
All right, get in here

1396
04:33:47,959 --> 04:33:50,119
Sell the tech center if you need cash, you just need the chronosphere

1397
04:33:52,139 --> 04:33:55,099
Not a bad idea. All right, let's get it right is good

1398
04:34:01,979 --> 04:34:04,220
All right, let's do it

1399
04:34:04,779 --> 04:34:08,549
What do we got over here? I have lots of money tons of money

1400
04:34:14,919 --> 04:34:19,880
Shoot it I want you to power power power power power power power power power power

1401
04:34:26,950 --> 04:34:30,229
All right, anybody else I could maybe take this over

1402
04:34:31,560 --> 04:34:33,639
Vehicles, oh don't you dare?

1403
04:34:34,680 --> 04:34:36,299
fuck

1404
04:34:36,299 --> 04:34:38,790
Okay, any doubts

1405
04:34:38,869 --> 04:34:41,349
I just wrong power plant. I picked the wrong one. Hey agon

1406
04:34:46,169 --> 04:34:48,169
He's gonna do this in more than 40 minutes

1407
04:34:51,770 --> 04:34:53,130
Don't worry

1408
04:34:53,130 --> 04:34:56,200
There's plenty of time

1409
04:35:00,709 --> 04:35:05,529
Good. All right. Everything's online. I'm gonna fortify the fuck out of this place

1410
04:35:21,080 --> 04:35:24,439
All right, now I just need to survive for 40 minutes

1411
04:35:25,400 --> 04:35:27,400
Oh god

1412
04:35:27,979 --> 04:35:35,740
I need

1413
04:35:35,740 --> 04:35:38,040
kill this

1414
04:35:38,040 --> 04:35:40,520
Dude, you got mammoth tanks and shit up here already

1415
04:35:41,479 --> 04:35:43,720
Huh? You've already got mammoth tanks

1416
04:35:44,759 --> 04:35:51,049
Fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck

Put like stack them up

1422
04:36:35,189 --> 04:36:37,189
Cornispheres to stay online

1423
04:36:44,819 --> 04:36:46,819
One more and i'll be and then i'm safe

1424
04:36:50,900 --> 04:36:57,000
Oh fuck this is there's a side that's not there's a side this side there's nothing on it

1425
04:37:01,529 --> 04:37:14,150
So there's nothing on it

1426
04:37:14,150 --> 04:37:19,209
Um, I didn't even know I didn't even know I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I actually really didn't even know

1427
04:37:20,009 --> 04:37:34,409
Okay. Okay. Okay. Um a war factory right now

What's going on? This fucking mammoth tank over here

1433
04:38:29,189 --> 04:38:31,189
I didn't do this fast enough

1434
04:38:32,759 --> 04:38:34,759
I didn't do this fast enough

1435
04:38:41,770 --> 04:38:48,650
I need fucking units. I need units. I didn't do this. Correct. I might have to stop this over. I didn't realize oh

1436
04:38:48,810 --> 04:38:55,369
I did not realize I had to do that. I didn't realize what they were asking me now. I do I know what I realize it now

1437
04:39:03,099 --> 04:39:15,959
Uh

1438
04:39:25,509 --> 04:39:30,439
My what the fuck

1439
04:39:36,540 --> 04:40:08,169
I need another war truck. Oh my god, they're everywhere don't my god

1440
04:40:08,729 --> 04:40:40,040
Okay, 27 more minutes where's that ore truck where's that ore truck I need it now hurry hurry up

1441
04:40:50,490 --> 04:41:00,090
I might just sell the tech center. That was actually pretty good advice sell tech center if you need, uh stuff

1442
04:41:03,540 --> 04:41:08,080
Um, okay here comes another bunch of people

1443
04:41:09,040 --> 04:41:11,790
Yes, sir

1444
04:41:19,400 --> 04:41:28,400
It's all that orange building in the middle what orange building I can't that's not mine

1445
04:41:30,299 --> 04:41:32,299
You mean the chronosphere almost

1446
04:41:32,779 --> 04:41:46,270
close

1447
04:41:46,270 --> 04:42:01,099
I need the money. They're in the tech center. They're in the tech center

1448
04:42:01,180 --> 04:42:04,619
They're in the tech center. Somebody told me to sell the tech center and they were so convincing

1449
04:42:09,020 --> 04:42:13,259
So he said if you run out of money sell the tech center and I go to sell the chronosphere

1450
04:42:14,220 --> 04:42:18,639
And I even said it twice back to myself over the last 15 minutes

1451
04:42:23,770 --> 04:42:30,090
And I have to start over from the very beginning, all right, let me do this differently

1452

Let's get another medium tank

1537
04:59:05,200 --> 04:59:10,080
I would build more turrets, but I guess maybe i'll put another one over here

1538
04:59:12,430 --> 04:59:15,630
Yes, sir. Acknowledge sell your construction yard. Why would I do that?

1539
04:59:17,080 --> 04:59:24,250
That sounds like a bad idea

1540
04:59:24,650 --> 04:59:28,200
I'll do one more up here in this spot

1541
04:59:39,099 --> 04:59:43,580
All right, here it comes here's a block them off block them up. They're gonna come don't even let them get to shore

05:00:57,000 --> 05:01:08,319
Just get up there and fight

1549
05:01:13,549 --> 05:01:17,000
So i'm gonna start doing light tanks

1550
05:01:24,569 --> 05:01:26,569
No only medium tanks

1551
05:01:27,549 --> 05:01:29,549

13 minutes reporting I need to stop making stuff

1568
05:04:25,840 --> 05:04:31,790

05:05:03,979 --> 05:05:08,919

All right now i'm gonna do only turrets

1577
05:05:37,319 --> 05:05:39,319
I'm gonna pull everybody back

1578
05:05:41,099 --> 05:05:43,439
I want at least three turrets on each side. I heard something

1579
05:05:59,439 --> 05:06:07,630
Don't let him destroy that I need that nine minutes remain

1580
05:06:15,950 --> 05:06:21,009
Yeah, you ain't going in this way that's fine coming this way one mammoth tank

1581
05:06:25,069 --> 05:06:39,020
Oh so much to pay attention to

1582
05:06:39,259 --> 05:06:53,689
Who's left what else what else what else what else what else we good?

1583
05:07:07,979 --> 05:07:10,459
Don't let him in the face they're going for the v2 rockets

1584
05:07:11,419 --> 05:07:15,770
Um, um, I don't know over here

1585
05:07:18,139 --> 05:07:20,139
Don't do it sounds

1586
05:07:35,790 --> 05:07:37,790
Five minutes, that's it

1587
05:07:40,990 --> 05:07:42,860
Get over there

1588
05:07:42,860 --> 05:07:46,380
Uh, okay another turret

1589
05:07:48,599 --> 05:07:50,599
Don't go too far out here

1590
05:07:57,709 --> 05:07:59,229
What needs help?

1591
05:07:59,229 --> 05:08:02,159
this side does

1592
05:08:14,959 --> 05:08:43,900
No on the northern front money. All right, don't bring every single person. Yes, sir pull it back. Yes, sir

1593
05:08:45,310 --> 05:08:49,340
That hurt pull it back back back back back back. I need some right side support

1594
05:08:57,119 --> 05:09:01,150
All right three minutes I haven't saved it in a long time

1595
05:09:11,709 --> 05:09:13,630
This should be in the bag

1596
05:09:13,630 --> 05:09:16,169
All right, that

1597
05:09:16,169 --> 05:09:18,169
Yes, sir. This is wild

1598
05:09:21,130 --> 05:09:23,130
40 minutes defense now

1599
05:09:29,080 --> 05:09:31,389
Two minutes remain

1600
05:09:47,819 --> 05:09:49,819
I think they it's gonna take too long for them to get over

1601
05:09:50,860 --> 05:09:54,840
This should be done

1602
05:09:54,840 --> 05:09:58,040
I really just hope I don't have to kill them at the end because that would suck

1603
05:09:58,680 --> 05:10:10,279
Kill his ore truck

1604
05:10:10,279 --> 05:10:15,400
I have to assume the ore is meaningless because they just it's like waves. So I don't know. I don't think I don't think he even has to

1605
05:10:16,439 --> 05:10:18,439
Actually spend money

1606
05:10:18,680 --> 05:10:23,040
Plus we got 30 seconds still

1607
05:10:29,500 --> 05:10:31,500
This is counting down very fast

1608
05:10:31,659 --> 05:10:35,759
Is it kind of not that fast?

1609
05:10:37,080 --> 05:10:39,479
So that wasn't 40 minutes then that was like 10 minutes

1610
05:10:55,139 --> 05:10:57,560
46 minutes now, I guess it was 46 minutes

1611
05:11:06,790 --> 05:11:18,909
Incredible. All right. I feel like i've gone bottom most of the time

1612
05:11:19,869 --> 05:11:35,520
Let's go up commander. Is he controlling that? I believe if he may well be at the turning point of this war

1613
05:11:36,000 --> 05:11:40,529
The stalin's iron curtain offline and the success of the chronosphere

1614
05:11:41,310 --> 05:11:44,299
Victory is finally within our grasp

1615
05:11:45,630 --> 05:11:49,770
However, there is still much to be done

1616
05:11:51,290 --> 05:11:54,169
One of our spies has confirmed our worst fears

1617
05:11:54,889 --> 05:12:01,069
So russians have developed a weapon greater than anything previously known an atomic bomb

1618
05:12:02,330 --> 05:12:06,490
Stalin plans to unleash these bombs on several european cities

1619
05:12:07,290 --> 05:12:10,970
If he succeeds all they have worked for as a race as allies

1620
05:12:11,529 --> 05:12:14,380
To be for naught

1621
05:12:14,380 --> 05:12:15,419
this

1622
05:12:15,419 --> 05:12:17,419
Is major vladimir korsygin?

1623
05:12:17,659 --> 05:12:20,080
One of stalin's key atomic strategists

1624
05:12:21,400 --> 05:12:26,840
Intelligence indicates that he has vital information on stalin's plans for this new weapon

1625
05:12:28,060 --> 05:12:32,159
Kosygin is appalled by stalin's methods and is ready to defect

1626
05:12:33,400 --> 05:12:34,619
apparently

1627
05:12:34,619 --> 05:12:37,340
Stalin plans to use his own troops

1628
05:12:37,979 --> 05:12:43,500
As sacrificial lambs to draw our forces into a trap once v takes the bait

1629
05:12:44,139 --> 05:12:50,959
He drops the bomb you will find Kosygin here in the riha compound

1630
05:12:51,659 --> 05:12:56,439
Direct the spy past that compound's defenses to the command center

1631
05:12:57,790 --> 05:13:02,599
Once you reach Kosygin get your apcs in and Kosygin out

1632
05:13:03,159 --> 05:13:24,090
Okay, build your base get a spy into the command center. Let's do it. Let's see if we can get someone clean and quick

1633
05:13:37,279 --> 05:13:40,729
Clean and quick

1634
05:13:40,970 --> 05:13:44,650
Scouts you go that way

1635
05:13:45,610 --> 05:13:46,970
You go that way

1636
05:13:46,970 --> 05:13:53,310
Good luck

1637
05:13:54,509 --> 05:14:01,040
Okay

1638
05:14:01,360 --> 05:14:03,360
There's very ore on this whole island

1639
05:14:05,819 --> 05:14:08,759
Uh

1640
05:14:12,220 --> 05:14:14,220
Well, why am I building a refinery then?

1641
05:14:24,270 --> 05:14:27,790
No, no, no, no, no, but I should have built right over here though

1642
05:14:29,310 --> 05:14:31,310
All right, i'm restarting

1643
05:14:31,630 --> 05:14:35,229
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I this is gonna be clean and quick. This is not clean and quick

1644
05:14:46,599 --> 05:14:51,560
You have the game speed termed up this is what yeah, this is the default though, I think isn't it?

1645
05:14:53,080 --> 05:14:55,080
I don't think I changed anything

1646
05:14:56,759 --> 05:15:00,159
There we go

1647
05:15:02,479 --> 05:15:06,479
Turn it up more. No, you can't play this game at like times 10 speed. It's ridiculous

1648
05:15:10,299 --> 05:15:12,299
Yeah, there's plenty of uh fluid over here

1649
05:15:14,490 --> 05:15:16,540
Plenty of food

1650
05:15:16,540 --> 05:15:18,540
I think the default's actually even faster

1651
05:15:20,459 --> 05:15:25,819
I think it actually is but it becomes unmanageable when you go so high for instance. Just look

1652
05:15:28,720 --> 05:15:30,720
One two, like just watch this

1653
05:15:35,069 --> 05:15:46,569
Um, I my brain can't handle this turn it down turn it down. It's actually hurting me

1654
05:15:49,880 --> 05:15:51,959
Okay. Good. Uh now i'm gonna do barracks

1655
05:15:53,020 --> 05:16:00,000
Let's get a spy

1656
05:16:02,479 --> 05:16:04,479
Spy is we need a

1657
05:16:08,830 --> 05:16:13,310
Not advanced power first

1658
05:16:15,840 --> 05:16:17,840
You're gonna do red alert two some other day

1659
05:16:18,639 --> 05:16:20,880
Maybe I mean, I love these games

1660
05:16:22,119 --> 05:16:25,159
I didn't play that much red alert two, but I do remember it was fun

1661
05:16:25,240 --> 05:16:32,830
Um

1662
05:16:32,830 --> 05:16:36,110
You can uh, you deploy your troops in red alert two, right?

1663
05:16:36,189 --> 05:16:38,990
You can bunker them down in that big mechanic of the game

1664
05:16:40,110 --> 05:16:41,869
Actually, it's pretty huge

1665
05:16:41,869 --> 05:16:50,520
You have a spy into the command center. I'm gonna try

1666
05:16:55,180 --> 05:16:57,659
You need a naval yard go ahead and build it

1667
05:17:04,720 --> 05:17:08,560
They promote that's right. They do promote that's so fun. Yeah, i'll play that

1668
05:17:12,000 --> 05:17:15,919
Uh, i'm thinking down here so they're the transports aren't any danger

1669
05:17:18,349 --> 05:17:21,290
Let's get them in one see what we can do

1670
05:17:28,720 --> 05:17:37,360
War factory jan rittles is the best one. Yes, sir. They're all good

1671
05:17:40,970 --> 05:17:43,450
There's not very many commanding conquers that aren't fun

1672
05:17:45,259 --> 05:17:47,259
Tiberian sun is fun

1673
05:17:47,740 --> 05:17:51,500
All right, i'm just gonna go on a little espionage mission here

1674
05:18:00,110 --> 05:18:01,770
Just keep going up

1675
05:18:01,770 --> 05:18:06,330
It doesn't seem like i'm very much danger, but i'm gonna tech for a little bit to make sure I don't get killed

1676
05:18:08,490 --> 05:18:11,310
Have an assault team going with the spy

1677
05:18:12,349 --> 05:18:15,790
The reason why I don't want to do that is because they might just all instantly die

1678
05:18:21,639 --> 05:18:25,080
I am going to do three ore trucks together at the same time

1679
05:18:26,599 --> 05:18:28,599

Let's give it a let's give it a shot

1780
05:31:09,900 --> 05:31:15,209
Get rid of the dogs

1781
05:31:15,450 --> 05:31:20,750
Oh, oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. That's a lot

1782
05:31:27,950 --> 05:31:36,380

There's people in there there's people in here get out open open open open out out out out

1785
05:32:50,880 --> 05:32:53,369
Wait, those things attack. I didn't realize

1786
05:33:13,959 --> 05:33:16,680
No dogs just gotta get to the tech center

1787
05:33:19,279 --> 05:33:30,220
King and country indeed king and country. All right, it's tech center right here for king and country

1788
05:33:38,279 --> 05:33:40,279
But that's not that's the command center

1789
05:33:41,520 --> 05:33:47,439
Bring him back to the of course. Oh shit. Wait, he's just gonna walk out. Of course move out

1790
05:33:47,919 --> 05:33:51,520
He's just gonna walk out. Oh, there's dogs now, of course, of course

1791
05:33:52,639 --> 05:33:53,599
Oh

1792
05:33:53,599 --> 05:33:57,240
We need to make a distraction

1793
05:33:58,680 --> 05:34:00,680
Look at the dogs

1794
05:34:07,900 --> 05:34:11,419
Okay, I need this distraction a bat I need a huge distraction

1795
05:34:14,250 --> 05:34:16,250
Oh man, this is bad

1796
05:34:18,639 --> 05:34:21,200
I need to go over there. How the fuck am I supposed to leave?

1797
05:34:22,080 --> 05:34:24,080
Send a decoy spy out to die first

1798
05:34:26,240 --> 05:34:33,919
Yes, of course, yes, yes, of course move out move out

1799
05:34:37,580 --> 05:34:39,580
You brought him over here

1800
05:34:40,220 --> 05:34:42,220
I god damn it. I can't

1801
05:34:43,150 --> 05:34:45,150
What the fuck?

1802
05:34:45,229 --> 05:34:50,319
I don't even know where where did I save the fucking I don't even know where I saved the game

1803
05:34:50,799 --> 05:34:52,799
Wait, did I even save it? I don't even know

1804
05:34:53,119 --> 05:34:56,650
What's it called? I don't even know

1805
05:34:59,630 --> 05:35:00,509
the

1806
05:35:00,509 --> 05:35:02,750
There's like 60 dogs in this base

1807
05:35:07,959 --> 05:35:09,959
Oh my fucking god

1808
05:35:12,040 --> 05:35:22,840
Acknowledge acknowledge they even have them up in the corner stored. What a pain in the ass

1809
05:35:23,560 --> 05:35:28,990
Yes, sir

1810
05:35:28,990 --> 05:35:32,750
All right. Well now that I know that the entire base is dogs that now I know

1811
05:35:46,090 --> 05:35:48,090
How are you supposed to sneak a spy in there?

1812
05:35:48,880 --> 05:35:51,040
That does that doesn't work

1813
05:35:51,040 --> 05:35:53,040
The whole base is dogs. How do you get in there?

1814
05:35:54,360 --> 05:35:57,400
Do I have to just go just kill everything and then sneak a spy in?

1815
05:36:00,400 --> 05:36:02,799
The term sneak doesn't make any sense at that point

1816
05:36:05,470 --> 05:36:10,189
Just running and just cause a massacre and then sneak in a spy when there's three buildings left

1817
05:36:17,279 --> 05:36:20,090
Just zerg the dogs

1818
05:36:20,090 --> 05:36:23,209
Send a hundred spies. I might even just fucking do that

1819
05:36:28,349 --> 05:36:46,880
No, they can't even attack. I can't believe I didn't even save it either. Oh, it's so annoying

1820
05:36:48,000 --> 05:36:56,540
You cannot win against so weak might no you can't win against

1821
05:36:57,979 --> 05:36:59,979
Stealth missions. Yes, sir

1822
05:37:00,380 --> 05:37:08,639
He's fully molded. Well, not yet

1823
05:37:09,279 --> 05:37:17,919
Who's my favorite classical composer, uh, I don't even know. I don't know any classical composers

1824
05:37:18,479 --> 05:37:20,880
Besides like bethoven. I guess bethoven is pretty cool

1825
05:37:22,240 --> 05:37:31,360
I mean bethoven

1826
05:37:31,360 --> 05:37:33,360
Mozart. I mean, yeah, I don't

1827
05:37:33,759 --> 05:37:36,159
I'm not like I don't have bethoven cds in my car

1828
05:37:36,880 --> 05:37:44,459
All right, we're going tanks and we're just going we're just

1829
05:37:45,099 --> 05:37:47,150
We're going hard

1830
05:37:47,150 --> 05:37:49,150
shitload of tanks shitload of light tanks

1831
05:37:50,299 --> 05:37:53,580
Just run them over kim says that he's still on the same level

1832
05:37:53,900 --> 05:37:55,099
No

1833
05:37:55,099 --> 05:37:56,220
Yes, sir

1834
05:37:56,220 --> 05:37:58,220
I am not on the same level

1835
05:37:58,220 --> 05:38:04,779
No, i'm not at that when kim was watching like an hour ago. I was on the previous mission. This is a different mission

1836
05:38:11,819 --> 05:38:15,580
By the way, just in case anyone's curious i'm doing six ore trucks

1837
05:38:17,069 --> 05:38:19,069
And then i'm gonna save the damn game

1838
05:38:19,389 --> 05:38:38,330
Because nobody's attacking nobody attacks

1839
05:38:39,369 --> 05:38:44,250
So I may as well just spam ore trucks and just have 20 million bajillion dollars

1840
05:38:45,209 --> 05:39:04,189
Yes, sir, that's it last one. Yes, sir, they're gonna start running into each other

1841
05:39:13,770 --> 05:39:18,040
Okay, get the radar dome I mean I want to build another construction site

1842
05:39:18,680 --> 05:39:24,509
I almost just built another one. That would have been really stupid

1843
05:39:26,909 --> 05:39:32,700
And guess what i'm doing a third war factory and then we're i'm going to send

1844
05:39:33,819 --> 05:39:35,819
50 tanks up here

1845
05:39:38,110 --> 05:39:40,270
I'm going to be a cycle about this

1846
05:39:40,270 --> 05:39:50,040
Yes

1847
05:39:50,040 --> 05:40:04,220
Dump dump dump dump dump dump. You wouldn't do 50 ore trucks, would you?

1848
05:40:05,310 --> 05:40:06,669
I probably would

1849
05:40:06,669 --> 05:40:08,669
But i'd like to beat this level

1850
05:40:10,720 --> 05:40:12,400
I'd like to complete this

1851
05:40:12,400 --> 05:40:14,189
It'd be good

1852
05:40:14,189 --> 05:40:19,180
Remember this level is unbeatable without the fursuit

1853
05:40:19,900 --> 05:40:21,900
Oh shit, where do I get that?

1854
05:40:28,909 --> 05:40:30,430
All right, that's enough

1855
05:40:30,430 --> 05:40:35,459
Look at these medium tanks. They're just so they're just so spammable

1856
05:40:37,340 --> 05:40:49,880
One more silo

1857
05:40:49,880 --> 05:40:54,759
All right, I don't want to just only I gotta do this again, too. This is uh

1858
05:40:56,490 --> 05:40:58,490
I gotta build a naval yard

1859
05:40:59,389 --> 05:41:01,930
Oh, that sucks

1860
05:41:01,930 --> 05:41:04,409
You promised to eat a ghost pepper. What happened? I already did it. I ate it

1861
05:41:05,130 --> 05:41:07,180
It was gross

1862
05:41:07,180 --> 05:41:09,180
Yes, it was gross

1863
05:41:17,180 --> 05:41:19,180
No one's coming over here

1864
05:41:19,790 --> 05:41:24,189
transports

1865
05:41:24,189 --> 05:41:26,189
Let's get a barracks up here

1866
05:41:29,979 --> 05:41:37,340
I'm almost ready

1867
05:41:37,340 --> 05:41:39,340
Just chewing through money

1868
05:41:39,979 --> 05:41:56,040
Yes, sir affirmative start stacking them stack them up. I can't really spend the money on it here. Yes, sir

1869
05:42:01,020 --> 05:42:10,509
If I get attacked and they kill uh, 10 medium tanks i'm gonna be very very upset

1870
05:42:15,279 --> 05:42:21,290
Does this fall still space cry cry cry cry cry

1957
05:55:07,680 --> 05:55:15,159
How do I leave what is north? No, it's not

1958
05:55:15,840 --> 05:55:18,430
What is that? Oh?

1959
05:55:22,409 --> 05:55:42,709
Oh, I did it 40 minutes not 80 I didn't have to restart though

1960
05:55:48,759 --> 05:55:54,259
That's so funny

1961
05:55:54,259 --> 05:55:56,020
That's so funny

1962
05:55:56,020 --> 05:56:03,639
All right, how we doing? Let's see. What's the next mission look like see if we're gonna do it

1963
05:56:04,319 --> 05:56:06,770
how many

1964
05:56:06,770 --> 05:56:08,169
atomic bombs

1965
05:56:08,169 --> 05:56:10,729
does Stalin possess

1966
05:56:11,049 --> 05:56:16,720
At least four to kill a ton warheads are in production

1967
05:56:17,400 --> 05:56:24,259
But there is much even I do not know much. We are nice for Stalin's speeches coming on

1968
05:56:36,409 --> 05:56:38,409
Stalin's

1969
05:56:38,930 --> 05:56:40,250
Correct

1970
05:56:40,250 --> 05:56:42,880
Think of a better word to describe

1971
05:56:43,799 --> 05:56:54,950
For margin he is mad. How can he do this?

1972
05:56:55,590 --> 05:56:57,590
Explain to see what are you talking about?

1973
05:56:57,750 --> 05:57:02,909
He announced he is telling everyone he's threatening to destroy the world his missiles are ready

1974
05:57:02,909 --> 05:57:09,349
He's preparing to launch. Is this possible the week ago? No, but now who knows this does not sound like a

1975
05:57:11,509 --> 05:57:12,709
Bluff

1976
05:57:12,709 --> 05:57:19,830
Even now a great purge tears through the Kremlin your allied force becomes too powerful in his fury

1977
05:57:20,229 --> 05:57:22,229
Stalin kills his own people

1978
05:57:22,869 --> 05:57:25,470
More death more dishonor

1979
05:57:26,189 --> 05:57:29,709
The Russians are manufacturing missiles at this site

1980
05:57:30,310 --> 05:57:38,259
This factory is main Stalin. We call it Johnny of a sod Nicky the dark horseman

1981
05:57:38,580 --> 05:57:44,959
You thought this is an ad for the tank games destroy it. Oh the IOS game

1982
05:57:45,759 --> 05:57:48,659
scorched earth

1983
05:57:48,659 --> 05:57:54,000
Establish a base first then move in on the command center get the spy inside

1984
05:57:54,000 --> 05:57:59,720
No, I suppose my realized launch capability get spies in the base anymore. This is our neutralized

1985
05:58:00,919 --> 05:58:02,840
destroys the facility

1986
05:58:02,840 --> 05:58:05,119
everything

1987
05:58:05,119 --> 05:58:06,599
scorched earth

1988
05:58:06,599 --> 05:58:09,549
You can't say sneak a guy in and then

1989
05:58:18,720 --> 05:58:23,479
Destroy all Soviet units and structures awaiting orders. I'm gonna give this one attempt

1990
05:58:24,040 --> 05:58:26,040
One attempt and then I'm gonna call it night

1991
05:58:26,080 --> 05:58:29,040
and then we're gonna get the game award stream ready tomorrow and

1993
05:58:37,439 --> 05:58:40,290
Is he addicted yes, but that's besides the point

1994
05:58:49,689 --> 05:59:02,080
If you don't know what I'm talking about tune in tomorrow I will go over a full explanation of how the game is going to work

1995
05:59:02,439 --> 05:59:12,319
Let's just kind of take a look while we build this up. Where's the

1996
05:59:12,840 --> 05:59:14,439

Or we're over here

1999
05:59:26,860 --> 05:59:29,860
Diamonds are over here. Whatever the hell these are. These are worth more money

2000
05:59:34,900 --> 05:59:36,900
I need to make sure I'm not going into danger

2001
05:59:48,159 --> 05:59:51,159

06:00:39,810 --> 06:00:43,590
Okay, destroy all server units and structures

2007

2116
06:16:43,639 --> 06:16:46,389
Wait, where's the tech center?

06:20:46,000 --> 06:20:47,939
There's no other dogs

2149
06:20:47,939 --> 06:20:53,380
Go right into the command center and the tech center two spies. There are no dogs. There's dog right there. Who cares kill it

06:21:10,389 --> 06:21:11,889
Where's the dog?

2155
06:21:17,759 --> 06:21:21,860
No, there isn't a dog

2156
06:21:23,349 --> 06:21:26,150
Just take out the the base thing here just take it out if I can get a spy in

2157
06:21:31,889 --> 06:21:42,180
That's all I need

2158
06:21:42,180 --> 06:21:44,180
Good. This should be it

2159
06:21:45,060 --> 06:21:46,819
If this isn't it then I quit

2160
06:21:46,819 --> 06:21:55,860
I have as many power plants as I have entire base

2161
06:21:58,630 --> 06:22:00,869
Save the game. No, this is this is a shit show. I made like

2162
06:22:01,509 --> 06:22:03,990
I made like 12 helicopters. This is not a real game

2163
06:22:05,110 --> 06:22:08,840
There's a dog right there. I can take that dog. There's a dog right there, too. I take the dogs out

2164
06:22:09,799 --> 06:22:21,700

2165
06:22:28,759 --> 06:22:31,119

2166
06:22:31,520 --> 06:22:34,159
Acknowledged acknowledged target

2167
06:22:36,419 --> 06:22:38,580
Anymore I don't see anymore up here

2168
06:22:41,200 --> 06:22:43,200
Oh no, he's going for our dogs

2169
06:22:43,520 --> 06:23:07,119
Good to go. Why would you land over here? Oh this game?

2170
06:23:07,759 --> 06:23:09,759
Super hard and super into it

2171
06:23:12,740 --> 06:23:17,380
So I have to get a dog in the was it the tech center or the command center

2172
06:23:19,200 --> 06:23:21,200
It's in here, isn't it?

2173
06:23:26,959 --> 06:23:35,479
Is it the command center or the tech center? I don't remember

2174
06:23:47,110 --> 06:23:48,790
Oh my god

2175
06:23:48,790 --> 06:23:54,799
I just saw what was that?

2176
06:23:57,569 --> 06:24:02,130
Commander as you are well aware. Stalin has launched four atomic missiles

2177
06:24:02,930 --> 06:24:06,369
The only way to stop them now is to get into the command center

2178
06:24:07,169 --> 06:24:09,409
Each missile is controlled by a launch terminal

2179
06:24:10,290 --> 06:24:13,669
Deactivate all the launch terminals and stop those missiles

2180
06:24:32,419 --> 06:24:37,220
It's a sad day today, oh that sucks that sucks

2181
06:24:42,200 --> 06:24:43,880
Okay

2182
06:24:43,880 --> 06:24:47,479
Fire at the ground over here because this there's obviously mines

2183
06:24:50,580 --> 06:24:52,259
activate the mines

2184
06:24:59,810 --> 06:25:09,409
Get in there

2185
06:26:14,099 --> 06:26:16,470
You need to capture that with an engineer

2186
06:26:18,130 --> 06:26:19,330
dude

2187
06:26:19,330 --> 06:26:20,770
if you

2188
06:26:20,770 --> 06:26:21,810
Go

2189
06:26:21,810 --> 06:26:28,979
Wait a minute if you go just up this way

2190
06:26:29,860 --> 06:26:33,299
Can I cross this?

2191
06:26:33,299 --> 06:26:43,520
Because you could just take this up

2192
06:26:43,520 --> 06:26:46,000
Can I'm this is i'm testing to see I don't think I can pass

2193
06:26:47,680 --> 06:26:49,680
I don't even have any units anyways

2194
06:26:53,169 --> 06:26:55,169
What through the trees?

2195
06:26:56,790 --> 06:26:58,790
Can you like burn the trees down or something?

2196
06:27:03,029 --> 06:27:05,029
No, this was a shithead run anyways

2197
06:27:08,709 --> 06:27:11,509
No, you can't can you from here maybe it's just a little moat

2198
06:27:13,509 --> 06:27:17,860
Maybe I can cross it

2199
06:27:29,990 --> 06:27:38,000
Damn well, that was fun. That was a fun game

2200
06:27:38,720 --> 06:27:40,630
it's uh

2201
06:27:40,630 --> 06:27:43,060
red alert

2202
06:27:43,060 --> 06:27:45,060
It is as fun as I remember

2203
06:27:46,000 --> 06:27:48,319
Last time I played it. I was probably 16

2204
06:27:49,040 --> 06:27:59,319
It's very very good

2205
06:27:59,319 --> 06:28:00,680
last year

2206
06:28:00,680 --> 06:28:05,860
So am I going to beat it tomorrow?

2207
06:28:06,610 --> 06:28:08,610
Uh, I don't know

2208
06:28:08,869 --> 06:28:10,869
I don't know about that

2209
06:28:10,950 --> 06:28:12,950
There's too much to do tomorrow. I think

2210
06:28:13,430 --> 06:28:24,130
Play red alert 2 before the game awards. I cannot do that

2211
06:28:25,729 --> 06:28:30,549
Before the game awards i'm going to be in the minecraft server

2212
06:28:31,830 --> 06:28:34,770
So because that is really going hard

2213
06:28:37,560 --> 06:28:39,639
And we need to get it set up for the weekend

2214
06:28:43,220 --> 06:28:44,759
All right, that's it

2215
06:28:44,759 --> 06:28:46,759
I'll see you guys tomorrow for the game awards

2216
06:28:46,919 --> 06:28:48,360
You can beat this

2217
06:28:48,360 --> 06:28:55,139
We'll we'll see how much time is left. How long are the game awards? What are they a few hours two three four hours?

2218
06:29:00,369 --> 06:29:05,599
Something like that probably a couple hours two three hours

2219
06:29:07,000 --> 06:29:09,189
Well, it's probably going to take

2220
06:29:09,189 --> 06:29:13,990
It'll take probably at least 30 to 40 minutes to really slowly go over everything that's going to happen with the minecraft server

2221
06:29:14,950 --> 06:29:18,840
So after that maybe i'll just you know, try to beat it

2222
06:29:18,919 --> 06:29:22,439
I don't know. I can't make any guarantees that i'm gonna play it again today tomorrow

2223
06:29:23,319 --> 06:29:26,290
This mission has a special failure cutscene

2224
06:29:27,169 --> 06:29:35,990
Does it?

2225
06:29:36,069 --> 06:29:39,009
Yes, sir. Okay

2226
06:29:39,810 --> 06:30:02,319

06:30:36,900 --> 06:30:38,099
that was

2230
06:30:38,099 --> 06:30:41,299
Red alert two is the best red alert. They're all good. They're all of them are good

2231
06:30:43,409 --> 06:30:57,750

06:36:23,520 --> 06:36:26,560
After we go over minecraft. I don't know it depends on what's going on

Kind of weird to say I know it's not old but I know that i'm getting to that age where I don't think I should be

2271
06:37:32,759 --> 06:37:35,400
Fucking around and doing nothing with myself

2272
06:37:36,200 --> 06:37:38,919
You in this community has made me want to do better things for myself

2273
06:37:39,560 --> 06:37:41,560
Anyways, I hope you had a good stream. Good night

2274
06:37:42,279 --> 06:37:44,639
Well, first of all, happy birthday

2275
06:37:44,639 --> 06:37:48,180
And second of all you got a lot of time. Don't worry

2276
06:37:51,889 --> 06:37:54,049
22 is really not that old. It's not

2277
06:37:56,099 --> 06:37:58,099
If you're in your early 20s

2278
06:37:58,180 --> 06:37:59,299
You got

2279
06:37:59,299 --> 06:38:03,779
You got plenty of time. I I didn't know what the hell I was gonna do till I was like 27

2280
06:38:04,400 --> 06:38:06,959
26

2281
06:38:06,959 --> 06:38:08,959
And even then I still didn't know what the hell I was doing

2282
06:38:10,919 --> 06:38:14,599
And even now i'm still a kid now. I'm i'm not even grown up yet

2283
06:38:18,819 --> 06:38:21,540
I got and also I got news for everybody yet. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing

2284
06:38:23,750 --> 06:38:27,669
It's just a series of people just kind of doing the best they can

2285
06:38:32,259 --> 06:38:34,819
Even when you get to an age you're like, all right, I think I figured it out

2286
06:38:38,389 --> 06:38:40,389
It's a never-ending process

2287
06:38:42,709 --> 06:38:44,150
Don't worry about that

2288
06:38:44,150 --> 06:38:49,939
Happy birthday. Peaceful. Haley. Thanks for the 250 at my starfish. Thanks to the five community subs

2289
06:38:51,919 --> 06:38:56,000
I was very very focused today because I did this was just I play the game stream

2290
06:38:56,319 --> 06:39:03,189
I was remembering and it's being very very nostalgic and I was getting uh, I was being very nostalgic at how angry I would get

2291
06:39:03,189 --> 06:39:04,790
When I was 15

2292
06:39:04,790 --> 06:39:08,790
And I would just make the same unit and send them all to death and then I would smash my keyboard

2293
06:39:09,590 --> 06:39:11,909
Um went through a lot of keyboards when I was like 14

2294
06:39:12,790 --> 06:39:21,200
The thing they were just amazon basics 12 dollar keyboards. That's not canon. I know that that actually isn't canon

2295
06:39:22,759 --> 06:39:27,799
Now today was canon no just because last week was non-canon that that that doesn't bleed into the

2296
06:39:28,759 --> 06:39:36,200
And plus I retroactively made two streams from last week canon. Just wait, we're gonna play nancy drew again next week. Anyways

2297
06:39:38,610 --> 06:39:41,650
I'm gonna do the nancy drew like once a week for the next like

2298
06:39:42,770 --> 06:39:47,509
Year until people are so sick of it

2299
06:39:49,840 --> 06:39:58,200
No, but thank you for the five subs at the starfish and atma gives 500 bits here right after that

2300
06:39:58,200 --> 06:40:00,200
They said do you ever play red alert 2?

2301
06:40:00,439 --> 06:40:02,599
Yep, that's also a fantastic game

2302
06:40:05,040 --> 06:40:10,479
Slight frustrations aside with red alert. It's still that holds up pretty well

2303
06:40:12,819 --> 06:40:15,459
It's that still holds up

2304
06:40:16,419 --> 06:40:18,419
20 fucking years later

2305
06:40:18,419 --> 06:40:28,680
I can't imagine how red alert 2 holds up. But yes, I did play most of the time I played was red alert 1

2306
06:40:29,599 --> 06:40:31,599
Red alert 2 I was kind of

2307
06:40:34,020 --> 06:40:36,580
I didn't get I look I didn't get it. I never got it

2308
06:40:37,970 --> 06:40:39,970
Especially when I was younger. I didn't get it

2309
06:40:40,369 --> 06:40:42,770
You know when you play dark souls for the first time ever

2310
06:40:43,409 --> 06:40:47,650
Uh when dark souls first came out or demon souls first came out and nobody like understood what the fuck was going on

2311
06:40:48,049 --> 06:40:50,040
You just don't get it

2312
06:40:50,040 --> 06:40:55,319
Go watch my first dark souls video. That's a person that just doesn't understand what the game even is supposed to be

2313
06:40:59,540 --> 06:41:01,220
That's kind of how I was with rtss

2314
06:41:01,220 --> 06:41:05,939
I just didn't I just made units and fight I didn't because there's no strategy and I still don't even know what i'm doing

2315
06:41:07,799 --> 06:41:10,599
Point is it's a never-ending process trying to figure out, you know what to do

2316
06:41:16,930 --> 06:41:19,090
But yeah, I do I do love the old rts games

2317
06:41:19,569 --> 06:41:22,689
Warcraft 3 is another one that I was really into most of the custom games though

2318
06:41:23,650 --> 06:41:27,889
I loved the tower defense games people would be really angry people would talk shit to me all the time though

2319
06:41:27,889 --> 06:41:29,810
Because I was so stupid and so bad

2320
06:41:29,810 --> 06:41:34,209
Remember the tower defense games custom games where you had to work together and build towers together and make

2321
06:41:34,930 --> 06:41:38,290
the big tubes together so the monsters will actually have a

2322
06:41:39,090 --> 06:41:40,930
trail to go on

2323
06:41:40,930 --> 06:41:45,490
I would just do wrong stuff and people would be like, what are you doing? You're an idiot

2324
06:41:45,569 --> 06:41:48,930
Why are you building that there stop doing that you fucked up the whole line

2325
06:41:49,490 --> 06:41:52,529
And I'd be like, I don't I don't know. I just I wanted to shoot a guy

2326
06:41:58,790 --> 06:42:00,630
I loved tower defense

2327
06:42:00,630 --> 06:42:02,630
I there's one game mode in particular

2328
06:42:03,029 --> 06:42:05,189
In warcraft 3 that I was obsessed with

2329
06:42:05,909 --> 06:42:07,990
It was hero line war

2330
06:42:08,709 --> 06:42:10,770
And I am shocked

2331
06:42:10,770 --> 06:42:12,130
that people have

2332
06:42:12,130 --> 06:42:14,130
put so much time and energy and effort

2333
06:42:15,029 --> 06:42:16,229
into

2334
06:42:16,229 --> 06:42:17,189
the

2335
06:42:17,189 --> 06:42:19,189
defense of the ancient stuff

2336
06:42:19,270 --> 06:42:21,270
And not the hero line war stuff

2337
06:42:21,750 --> 06:42:26,950
Because you made money and then had to send units to the other team's

2338
06:42:27,590 --> 06:42:28,979
line

2339
06:42:28,979 --> 06:42:34,020
And you made money by killing other heroes that came over to fight you or by killing monsters and you could keep

2340
06:42:34,659 --> 06:42:36,259
uh

2341
06:42:36,259 --> 06:42:40,819
You could send crazy crazy expensive monsters if you wanted to and they had to deal with them. It was two teams

2342
06:42:41,779 --> 06:42:45,830
hero line war was seriously the the best custom game mode and

2343
06:42:47,430 --> 06:42:52,319
Nobody gave a shit

2344
06:42:52,319 --> 06:42:55,360
I would I did I did I went back in warcraft 3 and even starcraft

2345
06:42:56,000 --> 06:42:58,639
dota all-stars dota all-stars dota all-stars

2346
06:42:58,720 --> 06:43:04,849
I would refresh the custom game list over and over again because I just didn't want to play dota and you would get that one

2347
06:43:05,569 --> 06:43:12,130
Custom game lobby that was open that wasn't dota all-stars and you're like, holy shit. Thank god. Somebody's playing something else

2348
06:43:12,689 --> 06:43:26,869
It was so much fun. There were a ton of custom games as well. I hope they bring that shit back

2349
06:43:27,590 --> 06:43:29,590
It was an awesome thing to do

2350
06:43:30,520 --> 06:43:33,080
But you know, I could go off for a million years here

2351
06:43:34,040 --> 06:43:37,240
Trident jacks. Thanks for the 500 bits have been really sick these past few days

2352
06:43:37,720 --> 06:43:40,119
Watching your videos has helped me through some of the rougher nights

2353
06:43:40,680 --> 06:43:43,360
much love and appreciation

2354
06:43:43,360 --> 06:43:54,119
Thank you trident. Sorry to hear you're not feeling well get well soon. Hopefully you get better soon stream, uh reforged

2355
06:43:54,200 --> 06:43:55,400
That's a plan

2356
06:43:55,400 --> 06:44:01,479
I'm sure it'll be really really active. So i'll definitely do it

2357
06:44:04,099 --> 06:44:07,540
Juno upsetto. Thanks for the five community subs. I think I missed it. Thank you

2358
06:44:08,180 --> 06:44:11,840
With five gifted subs

2359
06:44:11,840 --> 06:44:16,369
Should you go back to the fridge to get one more pickle? Uh, that depends how many pickles have you already had?

2360
06:44:17,330 --> 06:44:22,360
I'd like to know tell me i'm good. I i bob

2361
06:44:23,159 --> 06:44:25,400
How many pickles one? Oh go get two

2362
06:44:26,119 --> 06:44:29,360

2363
06:44:29,360 --> 06:44:32,000
Uh, but thank you juno upset over the five community subs. Thank you

2364
06:44:32,560 --> 06:44:39,439
Goop snatch for the uh, that's not even the right amount of i've just didn't mean right say that I finally watched Aladdin though. It was good

2365
06:44:41,970 --> 06:44:43,970
Yeah, it is. It's a really good movie

2366
06:44:44,290 --> 06:44:53,509
Aladdin's awesome the original laden. I'm glad you got to watch it

2367
06:44:55,700 --> 06:45:00,180
Marvosh Magali, thanks for the 250. I love seeing you play these boomer games. I mean old gems

2368
06:45:01,060 --> 06:45:03,060
Any plan to play some old?

2369
06:45:03,939 --> 06:45:07,060
Mame games. What is main meme?

2370
06:45:07,939 --> 06:45:10,080
What is that?

2371
06:45:10,080 --> 06:45:15,270
And they say is it against tos?

2372
06:45:18,959 --> 06:45:20,869
uh

2373
06:45:20,869 --> 06:45:22,880
arcade games

2374
06:45:22,880 --> 06:45:24,849
oh

2375
06:45:24,849 --> 06:45:27,009
There are actually a lot that would be fun to play

2376
06:45:27,729 --> 06:45:31,830
I mean it's for some of most of the ones that you can't even

2377
06:45:32,470 --> 06:45:36,930
Play anymore would be fine

2378
06:45:36,930 --> 06:45:39,810
But yeah, I've thought about arcade cabinet type games before

2379
06:45:40,369 --> 06:45:42,369
The issue is a lot of the arcade

2380
06:45:42,930 --> 06:45:47,090
Cabinets that I would want to play came out on like another console like dream caster or something

2381
06:45:47,810 --> 06:45:53,000
But the ones that didn't it would be fun

2382
06:45:53,000 --> 06:45:57,560
It's been up to set it up correctly

2383
06:45:57,560 --> 06:46:02,200
C4g, thanks for the 250 germa used to never do war crimes pepe hands

2384

Thanks for the 250 shalashka

2395
06:46:49,250 --> 06:46:52,200
Thank you so much

2396
06:46:52,200 --> 06:46:54,200
Winsok, thanks for the thousand bits

2397
06:46:54,520 --> 06:46:58,520
Ten dollars here. Thank you. Consider this an apology for making you say dummy thick

2398
06:46:59,240 --> 06:47:01,619
Well, I said it twice

2399
06:47:01,619 --> 06:47:04,020
The second time, uh, it was ten dollars

2400
06:47:05,729 --> 06:47:07,729
Thank you for the thousand bits

2401
06:47:08,310 --> 06:47:12,549
Appreciate it

2402
06:47:12,549 --> 06:47:17,669
Flare pancake. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey germa. I was gonna send a bit message once I hit my two years subscription milestone

2403
06:47:18,310 --> 06:47:20,310
But it looks like i've put it off for a month

2404
06:47:20,709 --> 06:47:23,849
I guess final projects aren't the only thing I procrastinate

2405
06:47:24,470 --> 06:47:28,470
Kind of be looking forward to the fuck the king minecraft stream hoping to participate in that maybe

2406
06:47:29,919 --> 06:47:31,200
I hope so

2407
06:47:31,200 --> 06:47:33,939
There's going to be some very strict rules on the server

2408
06:47:35,080 --> 06:47:39,159
That have to be in place there's a ton of stuff back end that is being done

2409
06:47:40,040 --> 06:47:45,159
To make this go as smoothly as possible. Although there's I mean, it's this whole thing is a beta. Anyways, it's just an experiment

2410
06:47:46,200 --> 06:47:49,400
Tease us about it

2411
06:47:49,400 --> 06:47:51,880
Just wait for tomorrow tomorrow. I'm gonna go over the whole thing tomorrow

2412
06:47:52,439 --> 06:47:56,319
How many people at once it is a I think it's a

2413
06:47:57,040 --> 06:47:59,040
500 plus server

2414
06:47:59,119 --> 06:48:02,959
So i'm not sure it's the exact number but it's at least 500 people

2415
06:48:03,680 --> 06:48:16,450
That can be in the server at the same time and there's a lot of things that have to go into place to make it

2416
06:48:16,529 --> 06:48:18,369
So it works

2417
06:48:18,369 --> 06:48:20,369
Not enough

2418
06:48:21,090 --> 06:48:24,689
Once you cross like three or four hundred people in the same spot

2419
06:48:25,729 --> 06:48:27,490
You start to run into

2420
06:48:27,490 --> 06:48:29,970
Uh, not possible anymore

2421
06:48:31,330 --> 06:48:32,369
We'll see

2422
06:48:32,369 --> 06:48:39,060
It should be a lot of fun. We're gonna break the server

2423
06:48:40,840 --> 06:48:45,169
I don't think you will

2424
06:48:45,169 --> 06:48:49,090
There's a lot of stuff that's being done to help with that. So don't worry

2425
06:48:51,000 --> 06:48:52,040
I am, uh

2426
06:48:52,040 --> 06:48:54,040
Putting the necessary resources in

2427
06:48:54,759 --> 06:48:56,759
Let's just put it this way. I'm not

2428
06:48:57,909 --> 06:49:02,069
I'm not running this on like a pentium i5 in my basement

2429
06:49:04,000 --> 06:49:06,400
There's uh, there's a lot of legit hardware here

2430
06:49:07,200 --> 06:49:15,639
Because it has to be

2431
06:49:15,639 --> 06:49:18,900
But we'll talk about it tomorrow

2432
06:49:19,619 --> 06:49:22,880

06:49:51,200 --> 06:49:56,159
How fucked up would it be if this was real and shit and my brain was making this whole thing up?

2440
06:49:57,270 --> 06:49:58,869
Can you imagine that?

2441
06:49:58,869 --> 06:50:12,919
He's so close

15 bucks from hypo cube

2446
06:50:37,650 --> 06:50:39,729
Glad you got around to playing this goofy delight of a game

2447
06:50:39,729 --> 06:50:43,330
I'm so happy when you squealed with excitement yesterday about playing this on stream

2448
06:50:43,889 --> 06:50:49,650
This dream brought back so many good memories of being a kid working my way around rts's and I wanted to thank you for it

2449
06:50:50,130 --> 06:50:52,770
You should play too sometime. I hear the fmv gets even better

2450
06:50:53,569 --> 06:50:59,669
Yeah, I love this game

2451
06:50:59,669 --> 06:51:02,069
that really is great, you know what my favorite part about this game is

2452
06:51:04,209 --> 06:51:05,330
the

2453
06:51:05,330 --> 06:51:16,680
Construction site opening that's my favorite part and it still holds up

2454
06:51:17,319 --> 06:51:20,639
But thank you for the 1500 bits

2455
06:51:20,880 --> 06:51:23,380
I will probably end up playing too at some point

2456
06:51:24,450 --> 06:51:29,729
Dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Hi. Wow. Great stream. Where do you stand on the twerking fiasco?

2457
06:51:29,810 --> 06:51:34,130
What I really didn't know so I can read so I can refund these bits if you disagree with me

2458
06:51:35,090 --> 06:51:39,700
I don't know what I don't know what this is and I don't know what it's working for you. I don't know what a twerking fiasco is

2459
06:51:43,720 --> 06:51:46,599
Is uh, I don't know. I don't know who that is

2460
06:51:47,479 --> 06:51:49,479
I don't even know that I don't know what that is

2461
06:51:51,939 --> 06:51:55,860
I've never heard that name before. I don't know what that is. I don't want I don't know

2462
06:51:58,389 --> 06:52:01,590
I don't twerk. I don't know but I don't care about twerking twerking. I don't care

2463
06:52:02,310 --> 06:52:05,759
There you go. There's my stance

2464
06:52:05,759 --> 06:52:10,000
Apple ship. Thanks for the 250. Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night?

2465
06:52:11,159 --> 06:52:13,159

2466
06:52:13,560 --> 06:52:16,290
Probably the first week of january second week of january

2467
06:52:17,250 --> 06:52:20,049
Just because there's a I there's a lot going on

2468
06:52:22,599 --> 06:52:23,959
there is

2469
06:52:23,959 --> 06:52:27,220
I still have to do

2470
06:52:27,220 --> 06:52:32,180
I want to get in front of the green screen and that's I have to wait a little bit

2471
06:52:32,580 --> 06:52:36,259
I kind of planned this all and then it all fucked up because of my illness

2472
06:52:37,220 --> 06:52:39,189
but

2473
06:52:39,189 --> 06:52:40,360

The green screens that has to happen first the minecraft has to happen first

06:52:49,740 --> 06:52:52,040
There's a lot going on in the next like four weeks

2477
06:52:52,919 --> 06:52:55,000
so and I really really wanted to get the

2478
06:52:55,639 --> 06:52:58,119
green screen footage for the next community content night, but

2479
06:52:58,840 --> 06:53:02,040
If it can't happen, I can't happen. It'll be for the next one after january

2480
06:53:06,090 --> 06:53:10,709
And I the rumble. I've still had them. I'm still making the rumble

2481
06:53:11,349 --> 06:53:20,299
That's still gonna happen. Uh, this is gonna have to be spread out a little further than I thought there's a lot planned

2482
06:53:22,150 --> 06:53:30,680
No set date for it though. Uh, let's get the

06:54:36,500 --> 06:54:38,659
After the minecraft stream is happening on the 15th

2497
06:54:40,040 --> 06:54:40,919

2498
06:54:40,919 --> 06:54:43,479
as of like the 16th or 17th

2499
06:54:44,200 --> 06:54:46,520
This is going to be the new channel is going to open up in the discord

2500
06:54:47,860 --> 06:54:49,860
And we're going to start to talk about nominations

2501
06:54:51,049 --> 06:54:54,330
And thankfully there's enough time because remember last year it was like a

2502
06:54:54,970 --> 06:54:56,970
Whole shit. Uh, that's what I want to do

2503
06:54:57,209 --> 06:55:01,369
Uh worst of the year best of the year and we did that shit in like four days

2504
06:55:01,369 --> 06:55:04,950
Do you guys remember that we did that in less than three or four days?

2505
06:55:05,590 --> 06:55:12,790
It was like less had to I remember it was like december 26 or something when I was like, okay nominate

2506
06:55:14,389 --> 06:55:17,450
So this time we're gonna have a good full week of nominations

2507
06:55:20,009 --> 06:55:22,279
And plenty of time to put it together

2508
06:55:22,279 --> 06:55:24,279
It would it might have been less than two or three days

2509
06:55:26,409 --> 06:55:33,099
last year

2510
06:55:33,099 --> 06:55:35,099
But I I loved it

2511
06:55:36,630 --> 06:55:38,470
But we'll have more time

2512
06:55:38,470 --> 06:55:40,549
And that is happening on new year's eve

2513
06:55:42,549 --> 06:55:47,990
Of course, but pin thanks for the 250 pin

2514
06:55:48,790 --> 06:55:52,470
once I showed up to a black tie symphony for

2515
06:55:53,669 --> 06:56:00,229
Tchaikov Tchaikovsky in some crappy shorts in a shirt during the intermission. They were setting up some sort of after party

2516
06:56:01,380 --> 06:56:06,099
I was chatting with the help and he let me snag a few glasses of wine for free

2517
06:56:07,590 --> 06:56:09,909
Uh little did I know it's the wine that gets you destroyed

2518
06:56:10,869 --> 06:56:14,389
So I stumbled back into the symphony and it's suddenly the greatest music i've ever heard

2519
06:56:15,430 --> 06:56:21,590
Afterward, I hung out with some old rich guy who hated his wife and then I got hit on by that guy

2520
06:56:41,939 --> 06:56:48,869
That's an odd story but it's that's a that's something that you can tell that's a story to tell

2521
06:56:49,590 --> 06:57:01,159
Well, this is the best music ever I love this music what does it go like

2522
06:57:03,560 --> 06:57:17,240
What's that one it's not that

2523
06:57:17,560 --> 06:57:21,430
But thank you pin for the 250. Thank you sticks renegade for the 250

2524
06:57:21,509 --> 06:57:26,069
It's almost that time of year again my birthday's on christmas since there's no christmas stream surprised me with a random

2525
06:57:26,069 --> 06:57:30,709
Happy birthday like last year and the year before happy birthday sticks renegade

2526
06:57:31,110 --> 06:57:33,909
And I was I will remember it and there's not gonna be a stream on christmas

2527
06:57:34,389 --> 06:57:39,110
But there will be a stream like probably a few days before christmas or like that week before christmas

2528
06:57:39,349 --> 06:57:45,029
So you'll get i'll be live on christmas not that i'm just i've rewind that not gonna be live on christmas to make that very clear

2529
06:57:45,029 --> 06:57:50,229
No christmas stream this year the minecraft stream and the new year's eve stream gonna be taking the place of anything that would be christmas related

2530
06:57:51,110 --> 06:57:53,270
We'll see a few days before christmas happy birthday

2531
06:57:54,069 --> 06:58:06,709
Let's get to the end. See you guys tomorrow for the game awards. We have a couple more bits we have

2532
06:58:07,349 --> 06:58:09,349
Bot squire, thanks for the 500 bits

2533
06:58:10,650 --> 06:58:12,409
it's uh, just

2534
06:58:12,490 --> 06:58:16,009
Me, I don't know what i'm doing here. It's probably probably playing a thing game of the year

2535
06:58:19,060 --> 06:58:21,939
And those eyes are real even though they might not be though

2536
06:58:24,520 --> 06:58:26,520
Those eyes could be doctored

2537
06:58:28,220 --> 06:58:33,290
I think they actually are

2538
06:58:33,290 --> 06:58:34,490
Yeah

2539
06:58:34,490 --> 06:58:37,209
Somebody fucked up somebody did something with my pupils. That's weird

2540
06:58:44,040 --> 06:58:46,040
Those things streams

2541
06:58:46,279 --> 06:58:48,790
What a hoot

2542
06:58:48,790 --> 06:58:50,790
Let's examine this for a second

2543
06:58:50,869 --> 06:58:54,259
I want to I want you to see

2544
06:58:56,340 --> 06:59:02,490
Let's zoom into the eyes

2545
06:59:02,569 --> 06:59:06,279
We're going late tonight. Damn

2546
06:59:06,279 --> 06:59:14,950
Why do I still even have this on the desktop?

2547
06:59:16,099 --> 06:59:18,099
So that's the one

2548
06:59:18,099 --> 06:59:20,099
I can't believe I thought this was real

2549
06:59:20,979 --> 06:59:23,060
I can't fucking believe I thought that was real

2550
06:59:31,959 --> 06:59:36,729
that's not the image though see people have gotten smart and

2551
06:59:41,450 --> 06:59:43,450
They doctor it in a way

2552
06:59:44,259 --> 06:59:50,860
Those eyes aren't real

2553
06:59:50,860 --> 06:59:52,860
Right. I don't think they are

2554
07:00:03,400 --> 07:00:05,720
I don't I don't it's just pupils

2555
07:00:06,520 --> 07:00:09,459
There's nothing there's no definition to the it's just pupils

2556
07:00:19,459 --> 07:00:21,380
You have a shitty camera

2557
07:00:21,380 --> 07:00:23,400
Hey

2558
07:00:23,400 --> 07:00:25,400
Don't be mean to my camera

2559
07:00:28,470 --> 07:00:29,990
Hey, thank you pin

2560
07:00:29,990 --> 07:00:32,389
For the 250 is this doctored? Hold on

2561
07:00:35,220 --> 07:00:45,909
Nope

2562
07:01:00,389 --> 07:01:05,819
Oh my god, where's my spine?

2563
07:01:21,720 --> 07:01:23,720
Beer belly and nerd neck

2564
07:01:31,979 --> 07:01:37,939
Okay, i'm out of here i'm out of here is this doctored I don't know

2565
07:01:41,610 --> 07:01:43,909
What are you guys getting these

2566
07:01:51,610 --> 07:01:53,610
Let me see if this one's doctored

2567
07:01:55,909 --> 07:02:01,139
What was this called?

2568
07:02:01,139 --> 07:02:15,770
Where is it? I mean that's where the image comes from

2569
07:02:17,880 --> 07:02:21,880
I think that they fucked with it though. They fucked with it. Look at the mouth

2570
07:02:22,680 --> 07:02:24,840
You did this is doctored. Look at the mouth

2571
07:02:27,619 --> 07:02:30,500
This a hundred percent has been met has been doctored

2572
07:02:42,630 --> 07:02:44,630
All right. Good. I'll see you tomorrow for the game awards

2573
07:02:45,110 --> 07:02:49,990
I can't wait

2574
07:02:49,990 --> 07:02:54,869
Oh, yeah, I should have a couple of bits pin. Thanks for the 250 right? I didn't even say it. Thanks for the 250 though

2575
07:02:55,909 --> 07:02:59,430
Uh say ha I used to get yelled at all the time when I was like 10

2576
07:03:00,150 --> 07:03:01,669
Because I would run

2577
07:03:01,669 --> 07:03:03,189
straight skeleton

2578
07:03:03,189 --> 07:03:06,709
Necro on diablo 2 go to cow runs and kill the cow king

2579
07:03:07,509 --> 07:03:09,509
Wow, you're the worst kind of person in the world

2580
07:03:10,470 --> 07:03:16,580
You you you went in there you killed the cow king on purpose

2581
07:03:19,979 --> 07:03:26,490
Wow, yeah, so that's unbearable. I can't believe you would do something like that you dick

2582
07:03:27,529 --> 07:03:35,959
Those of you that don't know the cow king if you killed the cow king in a server

2583
07:03:36,840 --> 07:03:41,540
Nobody else in that game could play the cow like it couldn't make the cow lever ever again

2584
07:03:42,340 --> 07:03:47,380
You essentially turned off everybody in that game from being able to physically open the portal again

2585
07:03:48,180 --> 07:03:50,180
You had to make another character

2586
07:03:51,419 --> 07:03:54,540
That was back when you could have like 20 skeletons it would lag everyone out

2587
07:03:55,180 --> 07:04:00,860
It was called the lag romancer. I never understood why everyone was upset with me because I was having the time of my life

2588
07:04:06,360 --> 07:04:07,799
Yeah, I miss

2589
07:04:07,799 --> 07:04:09,799
playing diablo 2 necromancer

2590
07:04:10,439 --> 07:04:14,919
Having 50 things on screen run around. You just don't have to do eat a sandwich and play the game

2591
07:04:18,889 --> 07:04:24,250
Maybe one day i'll do like a hardcore diablo 2 thing would just beat him with anyone that wants to play

2592
07:04:25,860 --> 07:04:27,299
And I just play

2593
07:04:27,299 --> 07:04:29,299
uh necromancer

2594
07:04:31,770 --> 07:04:34,810
What this would just be fuck the king again, except i'm a necromancer this time

2595
07:04:42,970 --> 07:04:50,310
D2 paladin. Yeah, that sounds like the worst stream ever

2596
07:04:54,229 --> 07:04:57,369
Come on the time to the game awards start

2597
07:04:58,630 --> 07:05:01,770
530 pacific they started right game. Let's see

2598
07:05:06,220 --> 07:05:08,220
the game awards are

2599
07:05:09,849 --> 07:05:10,970
Yeah

2600
07:05:10,970 --> 07:05:18,759
8 30 pm eastern 5 30 pacific i'll see you for that stream

2601
07:05:23,000 --> 07:05:29,110
The 8 30 eastern am I going to stream before that? I will not be streaming before that

2602
07:05:30,220 --> 07:05:33,099
Before that i'm going to be in the minecraft server

2603
07:05:34,810 --> 07:05:40,009
Getting stuff ready because that stream is happening in like four days

2604
07:05:40,810 --> 07:05:42,810
So I need to take some time to get it ready

2605
07:05:44,650 --> 07:05:50,409
But i'll be live. I would assume like at least 10 minutes or so before the stream starts so I can get it ready

2606
07:05:50,490 --> 07:05:52,490
We can be watching it

2607
07:05:52,490 --> 07:05:54,169
so

2608
07:05:54,169 --> 07:05:58,860
Did germa ever tell the oreo story one time I ate a bunch of oreos and threw from my mother's bed

2609
07:06:07,319 --> 07:06:10,759
Finally we have wembley t tv for the 250 germa

2610
07:06:11,000 --> 07:06:13,479
You've been in a coma for nine years after the helicopter crash

2611
07:06:13,799 --> 07:06:17,240
We had to plug you into the internet and you you're stuck in a vr simulation

2612
07:06:18,279 --> 07:06:20,470
Please wake up

2613
07:06:20,470 --> 07:06:28,599
I maybe I will

2614
07:06:29,000 --> 07:06:33,479
I'll stream starting soon

2615
07:06:33,560 --> 07:06:36,380
You'll get moments like this

2616
07:06:36,380 --> 07:06:45,509
All right. Good night guys. See you tomorrow for the game awards and we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow after the game awards
