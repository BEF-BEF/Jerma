1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,630
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some chivalry. Medieval warfare.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,940
Let me shoot this guy in the back. Or just miss.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,239
Just this blind playthrough, I just did the tutorial for one second.

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,420
Oh, get it. I wonder how well I'm gonna do here. Playing as the archer.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,979
Oh boy, a guy coming in. Oh, you wanna go? Oh, come on, come on, come on.

6
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:40,740
Block it, block it, block it. Get in my face. Oh, that hurts. Oh, that hurts big time.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Oh, so two hits, two hits. Okay, I get it.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,810
This game is brutal. Listen to those noises.

9
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,060
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,560
Actually, you know what? See if I can't snipe somebody.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:09,090
Oh, that was a miss. Oh, oh.

12
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,090
What does it look like? It makes a horrible noise.

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,739
There's a lot of dudes up there. A lot of dudes up there.

14
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:27,790
Oh, just like the huntsman in TF2. Bang!

15
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,180
Bang! Well, did that just hurt? I thought I just hit my teammate for a second.

16
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,120
Oh, that guy's throwing like javelins.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,370
Oh, come here, you. Oh, damn it.

18
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,310
Oh, that guy just destroyed me.

19
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,219
Oh, you know, I'm gonna play. I'll do one more life as an archer. One more life as an archer.

20
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:05,510
Oh, this game is fun. Yeah, like I said, I just finished the tutorial like two seconds ago.

21
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,879
Coming in blind, baby.

22
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,439
I know, don't I have like some kind of move or something? I know I have that in this.

23
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,639
Okay, let's wrap around this time. I'm not gonna stay here. We're gonna go over here.

24
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:22,580
Whoa, siege weapons. I see dead bodies. This is not good.

25
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,189
Oh, fight going on right here. Wait, is this guy? Wait, is this guy on our team? No, he's not.

26
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,620
Oh, God. Oh, God. They're on the stairs.

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,500
Oh, you got him. You got him, bro. Don't worry, archer back up. Archer back up.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,330
I don't want to hit you. Oh, I almost hit that guy in the back. Oh, God.

29
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,330
Get out of my face.

30
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:56,180
Let's go. Let's go. Oh, oh. Oh, fighting in the stairway is the worst.

31
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,870
Come on, follow me up here. Oh, God.

32
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,620
Every time we were swinging, we would be hitting the sides of the wall.

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,250
All right, I'm gonna go as... How do you change class?

34
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:17,169
Let's go as the knight. Warhammer? Oh, hell yeah, Warhammer.

35
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:23,990
I want the tower shield. Let's take the little broadsword. Let's do it.

36
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,620
I'm gonna start smashing people now. Oh, here we go, baby.

37
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:37,099
God, I'm a slug. I'm so slow. Nobody like behind me, right? Good.

38
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,680
All right, let's go for something like kills in a row here.

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,879
Get this guy. This guy's just slugging everybody.

40
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,629
Come on. Come on. Break his morale. Yeah. I'll smash you.

41
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,639
Oh, this is the ultimate game for like smashing.

42
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:06,129
Oh, damn it. Oh, that guy just came from behind.

43
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,819
That guy just crushed that guy. Oh, my God.

44
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,819
All right, I think we're winning.

45
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,439
Oh, everybody just gets stuck on the stairs.

46
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,839
What is happening? Oh, my God.

47
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,019
What? What? Oh, some son of a bitch behind me just killed me.

48
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,379
One of my teammates.

49
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:35,379
All right, so number one thing you gotta remember about this game is friendly fire.

50
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,379
You don't just like swing around in a circle when your teammates are all around.

51
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,180
All right, duly noted. Let's get back in here.

52
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,740
That guy just fell off. That guy legitimately just fell to his death.

53
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,430
Poor guy. All right. Form a line ranks, man.

54
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, this guy's toast.

55
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,430
Oh, hey, you want me? Oh, there's a lot of people. Never mind.

56
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,079
Never mind. Go for the jab.

57
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,079
All right, coming in. Coming in hot. Coming in hot. Coming in hot.

58
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,410
I missed. Damn it. Oh, be careful. Don't kill each other.

59
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,899
Oh, yeah. This is ridiculous. This is terrifying.

60
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,350
I don't even want to go down here.

61
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,620
Did I kill him? I got him.

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,139
I'm so scared.

63
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,449
Give him a little jab. Yeah. Uh-oh.

64
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,750
Oh, come on. I want to kick somebody in the face.

65
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,120
This guy right here. This guy. I'm smashing this guy.

66
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh, what? What? That thing's got a ton of reach.

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:57,819
Oh, I get hit by a bow and arrow. That hit me right in my face.

68
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:01,829
Holy crap. This is insane.

69
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,220
Oh, yeah. One more time is the night. I'm going to switch to something else.

70
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,980
I'm going to try Vanguard next. That seems like a lot of fun.

71
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,240
Is it like an objective we're supposed to be doing?

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
I feel like we're just all running in and clubbing each other.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Like, what's the objective here?

74
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,569
All right, one-on-one. You want to go? You want to go?

75
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,569
I'll kick you. Oh, no. I don't have kick.

76
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,319
Oh, you want to fake me out? I remember that from the training.

77
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,040
Overhead smash. What? I didn't block that?

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,459
Come here, you. Oh, yeah. Get it. Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,600
Anybody else? There's an archer up here. Oh, he's going to shoot me in the face.

80
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,120
Oh, God. This guy's broke. Whoa. Whoa.

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,560
No, don't do it. Don't hit me.

82
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,120
God. What? What? What? What?

83
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,089
I had the shield up. All right, let's go.

84
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,389
What do you want to do, Vanguard? Vanguard.

85
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:08,339
We're doing the spear and throwing axe and the war axe.

86
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,180
And when am I spawning? When am I spawning?

87
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,180
Did we lose? What's going on? Do we have no more, like, recruits left?

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,129
Oh, no, we do. All right. What is, like, the mission here?

89
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,500
I don't even know what the hell is going on.

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,230
Throwing knife. Can I just whip this?

91
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,160
Oh, crap. I'm sorry. I just hit that guy in the back.

92
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,589
I'm sorry. I'm whipping this. I'm hitting this guy right in his forehead.

93
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:40,980
You ready? Watch this. Oh, who is getting this in the face?

94
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,060
Yeah. Well, that didn't work.

95
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,870
All right. Don't worry. We got this. We got this.

96
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,779
Me and you, baby. I'll stab you. I'll stab you.

97
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,160
Oh, I'll get you. Oh, no. Oh, this guy's freaking me out.

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,000
No!

99
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,430
I got to get the... See, you can, like, fake people out and stuff.

100
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,430
I got to get the fake... I got to get the fake out down.

101
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,209
It's all about, like, going like this. I'm not going to hit you. I'm going to hit you.

102
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:21,519
Abandon the castle. Wow. Arrow just went by my face.

103
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,980
I don't want to get in the face of an arrow.

104
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
That's, like, number one thing I don't want to have happen.

105
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,750
All right. 1v1 me. Let's go. Let's do that again.

106
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,309
Wow. A lot of dudes. A lot of dudes. A lot of dudes.

107
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,509
Don't want to go up there. I'll wait for them to come.

108
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,460
Come on. Who wants to get overhead smashed?

109
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,460
This guy's going to jump over and just do a massive bomb swing.

110
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
I can tell you right now that's what's going to happen.

111
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,250
Here we are. Oh, what the hell?

112
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,250
What the hell just hit me?

113
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,480
Get him. Oh, damn.

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,830
Damn him.

115
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
There's two. There's too many. It's not fair.

116
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,419
Get me out of here.

117
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,600
Oh, God. Oh, God.

118
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,899
Oh, goodness. Nice.

119
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,460
Nice job. This game.

120
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
This game is just total chaos. I love it.

121
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,340
I love this game. All right.

122
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,340
Get him. Get him. Bomb rush him. What?

123
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Oh, somebody hit me in the back and hit from behind.

124
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,539
How do you win a game?

125
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,059
I have no idea how to win a game.

126
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,240
Uh, let's see.

127
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,799
140 to 141.

128
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,320
Next objective. Defend the treachery bots, apparently.

129
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
All right.

130
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,820
Wow. Went behind the face. My face. My face. My face.

131
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,169
All right. I got to be careful here.

132
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:02,940
I keep running myself into death.

133
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Oh, just like this. Oh, you want to guard?

134
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,309
Is that what you want to do? Why don't you come up these stairs?

135
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,309
Oh, get up the stairs.

136
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,809
I said that didn't kill him. That didn't kill him.

137
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,809
Are you kidding me?

138
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:17,139
Oh, my God.

139
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:19,139
Oh, God. I just got killed by my own teammates.

140
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,000
Dude, team killing.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is like the most realistic team

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,879
killer game. You just go around and

143
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,179
crush people. What am I? Seven

144
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,129
and oh, goodness. Hey, I'm not doing too bad

145
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,990
for my first time playing. Come here.

146
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,059
This guy. You got to be careful.

147
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,059
Don't I have something else?

148
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,059
Yeah, I get the throwing thing. Yeah.

149
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,139
Got you. Got you.

150
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,700
Oh, got you.

151
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Whoa. Did I? Did I? Okay, good.

152
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,059
I didn't kill my teammate. I thought I just killed my teammate.

153
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,870
Run. Run away.

154
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,870
I feel like a Monty Python

155
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,870
movie is about to play in the background here.

156
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,330
Wow. Swarm him. Swarm him.

157
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,330
Swarm him. Swarm him. They can't

158
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,529
kill us all. They can't kill us all.

159
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,789
Swarm his ass.

160
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,889
Oh.

161
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,889
I'm going to kill this guy.

162
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,299
I don't want to kill my

163
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:36,000
own teammate. This guy's got

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to die. Nice job. Nice job.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,559
This guy doesn't even know I'm behind him.

166
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,440
Man, this guy's a blocking maniac.

167
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,870
No, get out of the way, man.

168
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,799
Okay. Oh.

169
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:57,330
Oh, it was a bow and arrow. I don't even know

170
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,139
how you win. Oh, let me look at like

171
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,179
the objectives. There's so much

172
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,889
stuff going on. Oh, one minute,

173
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,600
thirty-three seconds. I see. I see. All right.

174
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I got to get to ten kills. I got to kill ten people.

175
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I got to make something

176
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,860
happen here. If you were

177
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
thinking about getting this game and you didn't know,

178
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
this game is a lot of fun.

179
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
I like love this game.

180
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,549
Here we go. Come on. I know you think I'm going

181
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,549
to fake you out, don't you?

182
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,049
Come on. Come on. Block it. Block it.

183
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,049
Yeah. What you got? What you got?

184
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,419
Oh, get your face smashed. Oh,

185
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,419
come on. You want to get faked out?

186
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,419
You want to get fucking stabbed?

187
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,419
Swear word.

188
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,419
Block it out.

189
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,419
Oh, this game makes Jerma

190
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,419
swear. You know it's crazy.

191
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:55,950
What is this guy doing?

192
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,769
Get him. Oh, kick him.

193
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,519
Kick him in his face. Hey,

194
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,519
I can swing down here. I got a narrow

195
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,519
weapon. I'll just jab.

196
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,340
That guy's dead. Good. Let's end this.

197
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,220
Let's end this.

198
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,480
Let's end this. Oh,

199
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
come on. What do you say? What do you say, man?

200
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
I'm going to fake you out? I'm going to fake you out?

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,980
Oh, god. Behind me. Get out of my

202
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,110
face, dude. Oh, no. 2v1.

203
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,110
This is not good.

204
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,629
This is ridiculous.

205
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,870
This is ridiculous.

206
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,750
Get him.

207
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,759
What? What? There's no way.

208
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,759
There's no way. I blocked that.

209
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,009
I blocked that. Do we win?

210
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,019
I think so. Yeah. We won.

211
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,019
Nice. Well,

212
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,019
if you were thinking of getting this game, guys, this game

213
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,019
is hilarious and a lot of fun.

214
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,019
So I definitely recommend it. This is my first time

215
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,019
playing. I'll probably play this again.

216
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,019
I'll probably live stream it or something like that.

217
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,019
But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.

218
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,019
So thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

219
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,019
And I'll see you guys all soon. And of course,

220
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,019
take care, everybody.
