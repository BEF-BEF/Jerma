00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,640
Hey, you, person that just landed on the channel page. What's going on? My name is Germa985.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,759
Or you can just call me Germa. That's what most people around here call me.

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,359
I'm a gaming channel. You probably could guess that by all the different playlists and all the videos below,

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,079
which you should check out and you should go watch some of them right now and possibly subscribe.

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,440
That's the whole purpose of this video. I'm trying to get you to subscribe to my channel.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,679
So hey, subscribe to the channel! Subscribe!

7
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,000
You see on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Germa,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,520
because I have two different sides. I have the very professional side where I review content.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,640
I review packages. What? I don't review packages. I review like games. Oh, here's like, here's a cup.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,399
This cup is good. There's a whole lot of stuff here though. I have my fun.

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:57,000
I have my professional side and I mold them together into sort of this lunacy that is Germa985.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an explanation of this channel and

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,159
hopefully you subscribe as well. So please subscribe, subscribe, and subscribe and I'll

14
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:15,379
subscribe you all next time. And of course, subscribe, subscribe. Bye. Okay. Yeah.

15
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:19,859
Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody?

16
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,019
Germa here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

17
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:28,980
Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay? I don't know what the statue is. I don't play this game.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,379
Oh wait, I'm going to bang. No! What? Oh, what was that? You were going to bang? What?

19
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,140
What were you going to do? You were going to bang me? Oh, there we go.

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,780
So of course as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because you can jump real high. I

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,340
never understood that by the way that why does Mario have to do everything? He's like the saviour

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,140
of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan. Left or right? Left or right?

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,099
We're going to go left. Oh man.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,379
I knew it. I knew what was going to happen too and it still doesn't matter.

25
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,180
What I'm talking about here is you'll see it. I go like me, me, me, me. Almost like I'm sweeping

26
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,780
the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys. And it's something I don't know why I do

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,500
this. And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse more so than I do,

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,300
which just kind of getting people in front of my crosshair. But I kill every single person almost

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,780
by doing the sway in quotes.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,759
in the world. And I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the fuck out of here, buddy.

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,159
And let me tell you, did I really have this in me the whole time? And the answer is yes,

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,879
everybody does. Everybody has it in them. You have it in you. You can, you can actually do it.

33
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,199
You just have to tell yourself it's possible and you have to act on those possibilities.

34
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:44,710
Hi guys. Today we're going to create a fucking washer, dryer, a generous channel there.

35
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,729
All right, fine. Right here. So he already finished it. That was it.
