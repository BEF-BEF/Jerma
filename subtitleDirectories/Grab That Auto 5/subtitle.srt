00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,919
Let's go ahead and type in Grand Theft Auto into the App Store search bar.

2
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:20,440
Okay. Looks pretty legit, right? Looks pretty- San Andreas, you got Vice City, and you got all this.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:30,170
What is all this? Grab the Auto 5. Please accidentally download me.

4
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:37,920
Okay, let's go ahead and uh... Thumbstick is right on an ad, so we're off to a great start here.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,450
Do I have a mission to do? Or is this just pop in the game?

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,340
This engine, whatever it is, can't even load 15 feet in front of me.

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,039
I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here. Besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.

8
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:08,659
Alright! Let's get out and walk.

9
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:19,079
Does this actually have a radio like GTA as well? I want that bike.

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:26,640
Give me that bike. Yes, thank you. Thank you for getting off of your bike and dying.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,599
Except he didn't.

12
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Oh my god, I have to unlock- everything has to be unlocked. Money and diamonds and shit.

13
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,310
Let's just get back in my burger car, one of the only cars I can fucking drive.

14
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,430
Hold on.

15
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,750
They take a very long time to load.

16
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,120
This one has graphics. This music is so annoying.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,620
Is anyone driving this car?

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,680
No, there's not. Nobody's driving the car.

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,909
How do I shut this music off?

20
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:17,879
Fucking music. I can't get over this music.

21
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,520
Shooting at it? Oh boy.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,689
Am I still in their car?

23
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,699
Watch out for the cop car.

24
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:40,669
God, this camera. What are you doing, camera?

25
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:46,870
Why is it just singing to me?

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,370
Is that a police car or is that a bird, like a chickadee?

27
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,300
Cops found you. Get rid of them.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,650
So they're just surrounding me.

29
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,340
Holy shit.

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,219
What am I supposed to- how do you beat that?

31
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:15,069
See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that don't care at all.

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,139
This is pretty normal to them, apparently.

33
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,860
It's just a normal day in Shitsville.

34
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:36,539
Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of fucking bricks.

35
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,539
What is it with those guns?

36
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:48,099
There's like silly bullets in those guns.

37
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,900
No way.

38
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,900
We know this guy really likes this song. That's good to know.

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
At least he's got a favorite song.

40
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,919
This one's real bare bones.

41
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,060
There was no loading screen. There was no menu. It's just one.

42
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:13,979
Okay, um, I wish I could explain how hard this was to move, but I can't.

43
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh, holy shit. That's a lot of money.

44
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,670
That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.

45
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,240
Go get it. 20 bucks.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,519
Where are you going?

47
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,899
I'm a psycho.

48
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,899
I can follow that guy.

49
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,779
Get out of the- pull him out of the window. Just rip him out of the windshield.

50
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:45,529
What is going on with- that guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.

51
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,800
There's a Mack truck. This guy's-

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,839
Oh. Pull him over.

53
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:16,389
God. Same game. Same engine. Same music.

54
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,389
The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spiderman.

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,110
I guess this one's a slot machine.

56
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,819
No.

57
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:38,310
I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.

58
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,699
Is somebody behind me?

59
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,519
Somebody's just throwing punches at me. Get out of here.

60
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,500
Are you serious? Is he still behind me?

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
He died.

62
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,170
This is another goal-less game.

63
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,860
Where the goal is-

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,170
Get away from me.

65
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,170
You fucking idiots.

66
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:27,819
Where are all these people coming from? Why are they fighting?

67
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,569
Why?

68
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,569
Is this dude just gonna stop fighting them?

69
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,939
Why would you start fighting this guy?

70
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,110
I don't know. I don't understand.

71
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,110
Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?

72
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I can sit here and watch. It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.

73
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
And then flying.

74
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:13,519
Oh, I'm gonna need a minute after this one.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:37,170
It's never gonna stop. This is never gonna stop.

76
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,170
I'm gonna die.

77
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,170
I'm seriously gonna die.

78
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,170
I don't think I'm gonna live through this one.

79
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:58,300
This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.

80
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
There's no reason for this to be happening.

81
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:10,600
I don't ever want this to end.

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I don't want to hit pause. I don't want to hit replay. I don't want to stop it.

83
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
But you know what? I gotta get out of here. I have to stop this madness.

84
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.

85
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
As amazing as this is.

86
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
So, I'll talk-
