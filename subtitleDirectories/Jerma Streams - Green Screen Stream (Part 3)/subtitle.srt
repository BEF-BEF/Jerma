1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:22,199
All right. Okay, everybody settle down. Settle down. Hello. Yeah, and guess what? You can hear me, huh?

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:38,869
You can hear me pretty well. Not like it was before. I'm not gonna drink a- hold on. Hey,

3
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:44,500
how you doing? So not like it was before, right? You can actually hear me talking. I've got a little

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,189
clip here. Previous times I've been in front of the green screen. You couldn't hear a single

5
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:58,840
goddamn thing I was saying. Not this time. Now you can hear me. And by the way, we're in full 60

6
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,180
FPS. Not 30. Not the 30 bullshit. This is 60 FPS. And I got a lav microphone and I hope it works

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,209
because if it doesn't then we're in big fucking trouble. Oh shit, I got a tweet. Does everybody

8
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:26,760
hold on? Hang tight. So you can hear? All right. I need to test this shit because I have no idea

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,930
how this sounds. I literally got these microphones like a day ago, not even 24 hours ago. If these

10
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,620
things work, this company's getting a major shout out. Like huge shout out. And by the way,

11
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:56,810
high quality camera this time too. High quality camera. Does this sound good? All right, hold on.

12
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,909
Let me just tweet that. Yeah, so hopefully it sounds all right. These things are pretty cool.

13
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,099
Let me try a scream test. Can I try? Hold on. Can I scream? Can I scream in your ears? I'm

14
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:16,360
gonna scream in your ears. Seriously, like I'm gonna scream in your ears and let me know how it is.

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,500
Ready? Why would I not do this in front of the green screen? All right, ready? This is an audio

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:32,250
test. What's up? Audio test. Testing the audio. I'm gonna scream, so turn down your volume. I'm

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,030
being dead serious. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was probably horrible.

18
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:48,090
I don't know. I just got these microphones like fucking a day ago. Is it bad? Is it okay? I mean,

19
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,240
we're peaking, but I mean, is it all right? You should smoke cigarettes. I'm not gonna smoke a

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:09,819
cigarette. Is it okay? Dude, my little brother's head just, whatever. Oh yeah, we need to tell

21
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:16,949
Discord we're doing this. I've got my wonderful production assistant Holly here. You understand

22
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,430
how much of a pain in the ass this was to do alone for the last fucking three or four years?

23
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,979
You understand how hard this was to do alone? What a pain in the ass it was. I promise, I'm not,

24
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm gonna, it's gonna peak. It's gonna happen, but let's see, I got the gray shirt. I'm good to go.

25
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,699
So what's the first thing I should do? She's gonna be here to help me. This is gonna be so much

26
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:43,020
easier. All right, so what I have to add, let's get some classics. Let's get some classics out

27
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:57,780
of the way first. Do I still got it? Do I still got it? Medium shot. That's not how I do it. What

28
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,870
am I doing? Hold on, wait, that's not, that's not how I do it. I gotta come into frame with it.

29
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:22,899
I gotta see if I still got it. All right. I still fucking got it. Sorry, mom. All right, so what's

30
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:29,189
the first thing? There are like 300 fucking things I have to do right now. I'm not doing this ever

31
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:40,550
again. This is the last time, so we're gonna blow through these like a million times a second.

32
00:04:40,550 --> 00:05:04,949
Wait, what? How? Why? Who? How? How? Why? How much? Where? Why? Huh? Who? How much? What was the

33
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:16,600
other ones? What are the other ones? Are you ready? Why are you ready? Into the camera or just off?

34
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Are you ready? Are you ready? You don't look ready. Hey, how? Are you ready? They didn't hear that.

35
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,290
They didn't hear that. You didn't hear that. You didn't hear that. I have a lavalier microphone,

36
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,819
but you didn't hear that, okay? What was I asking you? How? How do you do that again? Okay,

37
00:05:49,819 --> 00:06:00,360
are you ready? Because, I mean, very clearly we gotta go. Did they hear it? Answer? There are

38
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:15,370
answers. All right, give me. I have both of my hands in my back pocket. Like, oh, yeah, all right.

39
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:40,870
Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. No. Absolutely not. No. I ain't gonna do it. No. No. Sorry. No. No. Why not?

40
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,610
I feel like I'm at like a weird audition. I feel like I'm at an audition right now.

41
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,089
There's like three people with clipboards over there, and they're just like judging every word

42
00:06:50,089 --> 00:07:04,329
I'm saying. Why not? Huh? No. No. I'm sorry. No. I ain't gonna do it. Oh, fuck you. You see what

43
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:11,509
I got dealing with back here? You think I'm gonna do that shit? No. You do it. You go do it. You deal

44
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,040
with this. No, I'm not dealing with that. I may have caused it, but I'm not gonna deal with it.

45
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:27,959
You are. You're the one with the money. All right. What's next? Yes. All right. What is

46
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:38,180
backroom Jerma? Yeah. What is it? Come around the corner, stop and stare at the camera like a madman

47
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,860
for a few seconds before sprinting at the camera. All right. Why is it? How is this back rooms? What

48
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:54,120
does that even mean? Like this? They can hear all these burps and it's gonna be fucking embarrassing.

49
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,819
They're gonna hear literally every single one of these burps. They're gonna hear every burp and

50
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,699
it's gonna be, they're gonna clip every single burp I've done and it's gonna be embarrassing.

51
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,879
All right. Don't listen to my burps. Just fucking delete them. Don't listen to them. All right. So

52
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:27,269
around the corner, stare and then run at the screen. I just lost a shoe. Hold on. Take two.

53
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:58,419
Take two. Take two. What fell? Okay. We're good. Is that the only thing that fell? I think it bumped

54
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:18,460
up. I didn't, nothing happened to me. All right. Are we still live? We're good. Oh, that's an

55
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:30,950
expensive mic. No, it's not. Wait, that's yours? Oh shit. I'll replace it. I promise. Now the worst

56
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,419
part about that is you didn't get to see that, which actually kind of sucks, but I full sprinted

57
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:39,100
back there and there's a million cords here and I tripped over one of the cords and took an

58
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,980
expensive microphone down. I'm gonna replace it. I'm gonna replace it. There's so many cords back

59
00:09:45,980 --> 00:10:13,460
there that I almost like died. All right. We'll do it again. Here we go. There you go. Okay.

60
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:20,919
I'm not gonna, thank God it wasn't the ethernet. Okay. Ride a roller coaster. What are these?

61
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:38,570
Okay. Roller coaster. Should I be in a seat? Does this work? I hope this works. I wish that

62
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:47,610
was on camera. God damn it. It sucks that that wasn't on camera. So I'm gonna roller coaster.

63
00:10:47,610 --> 00:11:00,870
Should we do this from two different angles? Okay. I've been waiting to ride this one, man.

64
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,009
Yeah. You know, I heard this is the scariest ride at the park. I'm not scared though. Are you scared?

65
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:22,539
Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Whoa. Hey.

66
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:30,059
Hey. Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see? That's crazy. Dude, look, you can see.

67
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:37,909
You can see the water rides. I didn't even know the park had water rides. Okay. Yeah, dude. Hey.

68
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:49,559
Yep. Okay. Yep. Now I ain't gonna scream. You're gonna scream though. Okay. This is really how I

69
00:11:49,559 --> 00:12:22,820
know. Why is every wooden roller coaster do this shit? Yeah. Holy God. I was trying to be spinning.

70
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,009
Why am I spinning around? Dude, I got it. I got it. I'm all right. I'm all right. This thing ain't

71
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,929

72
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:39,450
ship even been raided? It's all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:35,320
I mean? This is a big drop coming up here. I don't like doing that. I feel like I'm gonna fall out.

77
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,419
Okay. Nobody uses for anything else besides what we're doing this for. There's no way anyone's

78
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,340
gonna use this for anything else besides riding a fucking roller coaster. All right. That's enough.

79
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:59,429
Evil villain monologue. I feel like I need to be in an evil villain costume. What do we have for

80
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:13,190
costume? Do I want to drink poison? Oh, I was like, what? There we go.

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:24,730
I'll do it one more time. One more time. I got to like duct tape this around my neck.

86
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:32,009
All right. All right. You cartoon monster.

00:15:47,799 --> 00:16:00,230
Yeah. Yeah. Thumbs up. Okay. Oh, God. Get it off. All right. Oh, God. Get it off me.

88
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:13,350
You guys feel like there's bugs everywhere. My diet coming out here because there's bugs everywhere.

89
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,029
I don't like when the bugs are everywhere. I can tolerate them when they're in small doses,

90
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:23,190
but dude, is this something on me? Is this something on my back? Is this something on my back?

Come on. Just get it off. What the fuck dude? Please get it off me.

Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off.

Come on. Yep. Hit it, please. Oh, my God, dude.

97
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,299
My rib cage! You just hit my fucking ribs!

98
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,470
That was my back rib, you fucking idiot!

99
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,380
Ow!

100
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
You didn't take me to a doctor!

101
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,069
You didn't take me to a hospital!

102
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,250
Please!

103
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,490
You hit way too hard!

104
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,799
What?

105
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,869
They can hear my heartbeat?

106
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Oh, it's because it flipped upside down.

107
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,019
Move it to your shoulder.

108
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:47,009
They can, wow!

109
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,890
Alright, hold on, give me one second.

110
00:17:49,890 --> 00:18:02,430
That's fucking crazy!

111
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,430
Somebody said, dude, we can hear your heart murmur.

112
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:10,430
Can you still hear it?

113
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,279
Are we good? Is that better?

114
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,980
No more heart palpitations?

115
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,250
I can't move.

116
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,680
Alright, so what have we got? What's next?

117
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,650
I'm on TV. Alright, that's probably up here.

118
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:45,819
They're filming.

119
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:52,289
Are you filming? I'm on TV.

120
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:54,289
They're filming, right?

121
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:58,319
Get out of here.

122
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,980
Hi, Mom!

123
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,420
Hey, Mom, I'm on TV! I'm sorry.

124
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Can I have the mic?

125
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
No, you don't have to give it to me.

126
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
I'm on TV, Mom! Look at me, I'm on TV!

127
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
I'm on the television!

128
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Channel 2!

129
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,099
I'll leave, I'll leave.

130
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,099
That's so cool that you guys are here.

131
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,279
That's awesome that you guys are here.

132
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,289
Do you guys come here a lot?

133
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,289
Maybe once every few months?

134
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,289
That's cool. Can I talk on the mic?

135
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,589
No, it's okay. Alright, I don't need to.

136
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,470
Can I talk? Okay, alright.

137
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,349
Bye, Mom. Pasta tonight.

138
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,339
Pasta tonight, Mom.

139
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,029
I hope so. I'll be okay with McDonald's soup.

140
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:56,940
Alright, now what?

141
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Cartoon splat?

142
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,339
Oh, like I'm running into the wall.

143
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,160
I'll do that one.

144
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:21,440
That hurt. I'll do it again.

145
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,869
Let me come from this angle this time.

146
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:48,349
Okay, what's next?

147
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,349
Yell at God.

148
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,279
Real funny.

150
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,740
Real funny stuff.

151
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
You did this.

152
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,650
You did this, and you can fix it too, you know.

153
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,650
What a real piece of work you are.

154
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,650
Oh, you created everybody.

155
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,960
Did you though? Sure it wasn't me.

156
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I could have been up there. I could have been up there and I could have done it.

157
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,170
You're a real piece of work.

158
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,410
You know what?

159
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,410
I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.

160
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,779
I was going to say,

161
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,779
Forget you. That's better.

162
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:40,500
Forget you, G-O-D.

163
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,140
You know, you have the power to fix all this.

164
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,099
Where are you?

165
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,230
We're all down here waiting for you.

166
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,500
You are a real piece of work.

167
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:05,359
Hopefully you can hear me.

168
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,329
So what? I'm standing in the street.

169
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,700
I've got something to say to you.

170
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
And hopefully you listen this time.

171
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Not like the other 30 or 40 times in the shower that I've done this.

172
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,660
You know what? F you. For real.

173
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,180
I said it. Yeah, I did.

174
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
How long do you want me to do this for?

175
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:34,400
AI Andy, okay.

176
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:51,150
Ah.

177
00:22:51,150 --> 00:23:02,130
Hmm. Hmm. Uh-uh.

178
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:17,390
Uh-uh. Hmm. Mmm-mmm.

179
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:46,099
Ah. Yes. Yes.

180
00:23:46,099 --> 00:24:01,039
Ugh. Ugh.

181
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,079
Ugh. Sword?

182
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:14,829
Oh, Oblivion, okay.

183
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:20,450
Stop, criminal scum.

184
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,579
I've never played Oblivion. I don't know how this works.

185
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,079
I've never played one minute of Oblivion.

186
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,450
No, I stream for like a day.

187
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,200
What do they say? What do you do?

188
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,420
It's stop criminal scum, right?

189
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,799
Is it stop criminal scum?

190
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:49,890
Stop, you violated. Okay, you violated the law.

191
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,769
Stop, criminal scum.

192
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:55,200
You violated the law. You will pay in blood.

193
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:08,180
Let's go.

194
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,750
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

195
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:27,819
Stop. Ugh.

196
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:37,660
Stop. Did I do good?

197
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,250
I want just some sword shit too, you know what I mean?

198
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:51,859
Swim? Well, I got the sword. Hold on.

199
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,859
Oh, they walk into chairs. Yeah, they do walk into chairs.

200
00:25:53,859 --> 00:26:02,339
Is my flight on? Yeah, I keep it here.

201
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,339
Make sure MPVs are shit like you and end up

202
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:07,410
doing something fucking dumb. I get you.

203
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,220
Is this Oblivion? Why is this not Oblivion anymore?

204
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,410
Hold on. What was that?

205
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,380
I don't know what that was.

206
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,140
But it was weird. Okay.

207
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,829
Yeah. Hey, how's up?

208
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:26,829
I heard you were talking about me and my kingdom.

209
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,200
Just a little too, a little too harsh.

210
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,859
You know, this was welded with Dragonbone.

211
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,119
I don't know if you can tell by looking at that.

212
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,640
I remember I was there

213
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,650
when this almost fell backwards.

214
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,650
I remember I was there when this was crafted in Dragonblood.

215
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,660
They call it Dragonstone Steel.

216
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,740
You think you can handle that?

217
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,289
You think you can handle that? Let's find out.

218
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,980
You want a duel? You and me.

219
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,470
Dragonbone Steel. With whatever you have there.

220
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,470
Whatever that is. What's that again?

221
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,539
Stainless steel? Yeah.

222
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,539
We all know how, we all know how sturdy that is.

223
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,740
Why don't you come over this way and let's see.

224
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,660
Come on. Why don't you come here.

225
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:25,329
Dragonbone technique.

226
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:47,329
Come on, come on. Easy, easy.

227
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:49,329
Ew. Ew. Ew.

228
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,170
Ew. Oops. I may have just

229
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,339
cut my finger. Oopsie. Oopsie.

230
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,339
Oopsie. Oopsie.

231
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,890
Oopsie. Oopsie.

232
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,150
Oopsie. It's okay. I'm fine. Come on. Come on!

233
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,150
Do it already. Let's go.

234
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,150
We can't just stand here all day, dude.

235
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:19,440
I got shit to do. Come on. Come at me.

236
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Yeah. Okay.

238
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Yeah. Look at me.

239
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,559
Look at me right now. Yeah.

240
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,059
I won. Stainless steel. Would you get it off

241
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,059
the fucking god damn TV?

242
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:38,619
Get it off the TV. Clean him up.

243
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:46,109
I'm peaking.

244
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:53,150
Yeah. It's going to be peaking.

245
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,460
I can't help it. Do some twerking?

246
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,890
Alright.

247
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,900
This is poison. Drink poison.

248
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:09,019
Alright. This is poison.

249
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:17,779
Well, not really, but you know.

250
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:20,400
Oh, wow. A magical potion?

251
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
This is for me?

252
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
No way. Thank you.

253
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,900
How much do I owe you, stranger?

254
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,200
Ten pieces of gold?

255
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,890
That's a steal.

256
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,390
Okay. You can use that one if you want.

257
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,950
What is this? Potion.

258
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,509
Clear. Clean.

259
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,440
Crystal. Don't mind if I do.

260
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,579
That's an option?

261
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,400
Or, I already had it on me.

262
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,140
I'm going to have to take a health potion for that

263
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,200
after that one. Redo.

264
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,630
I'm going to need a health potion after that one.

265
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:17,980
Good thing I stocked a few of them.

266
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,269
That hurts. A little. Does that supposed to feel like that?

267
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:25,779
It feels. My whole face hurts.

268
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,529
My face is burning. That burns.

269
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:31,089
A lot. What the?

270
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:33,089
What is that?

271
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,039
I feel actually alright.

272
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,039
I feel warm. I feel really

273
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,670
warm though. What the?

274
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,039
What was that?

275
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,559
I'm going to lie down.

276
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,799
I don't know who gave this to me.

277
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:05,170
I can hear my heartbeat

278
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,599
through my own head.

279
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,640
Okay. What's next?

280
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,779
What else we got? I love people clapping.

281
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:20,190
Twerk?

282
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,069
I'm going to twerk.

283
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:26,269
Yeah, I'm going to twerk. Yeah, I'll twerk.

284
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,829
I don't care. I'll twerk with the fucking

285
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:31,009
crown on. The king.

286
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,529
I want everyone to understand

287
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,970
that the king made a lot

288
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,970
of good things happen today, don't you think?

289
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,039
You little jester over there.

290
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,789
You're so funny. I made things happen.

291
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,789
I raised taxes on everybody.

292
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,099
Every single person now owes

293
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:52,099
40% more taxes. That means more money for

294
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:55,980
the kingdom. Oh yeah.

295
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,420
How many people did we kill today? 60?

296
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,170
Yeah. That's a lot. Could have been 70

297
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,170
though. Could have been 70.

298
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,769
It was a good day. What's that?

299
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,140
What's that? What did you say? Okay.

300
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,539
Feed him to the lions.

301
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,539
Yeah, feed him. Feed him to the lions.

302
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:26,619
Don't you think? I don't know how to twerk.

303
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:29,569
How do you twerk?

304
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:32,059
You have to go like

305
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,609
that. That looks like I was about to start

306
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:40,000
like jamming. Get the

307
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:54,579
crown off. I don't

308
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:59,180
fucking know how it works.

309
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh god. Okay.

310
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,940
Goblin time?

311
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Alright, hold on. I got to do

312
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,240
a wardrobe change. What was

313
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,950
that? I don't know how

314
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,950
it works. I really don't get it.

315
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm 37 years old. I don't

316
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,380
twerk.

317
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,259
That's alright. Do I have

318
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,259
like a thing to put on? Like a drape?

319
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:30,930
Oblivion guards? Didn't

320
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,660
I just do that?

321
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,779
Skyrim guards? I don't even know.

322
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,619
I don't play Skyrim. Yeah, we'll

323
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:49,869
put that on. I'm going to mute the mic while

324
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:51,869
I get into some different piece of clothes.

325
00:33:51,869 --> 00:34:35,889
I'll be right back in two seconds. Yeah,

326
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,889
I'm changing clothes. It's going to be all awful.

327
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,889
You're going to be able to hear awful noises.

328
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,889
Because I have this lapel

329
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,889
thing on. Give me one sec.

330
00:34:43,889 --> 00:35:18,260
Can you guys still hear me?

331
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Do I sound okay? Can you guys still actually

332
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,539
hear what I'm saying? Do I sound alright?

333
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,510
Okay. I don't think these little boots

334
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,690
are going to fit on.

335
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,630
Let me take my shoes. Yeah, there we go.

336
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,630
I'm going to look like such a dickhead.

337
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,130
What am I supposed to even be

338
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,369
doing in this?

339
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,369
A jester?

340
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:44,369
Entertaining.

341
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:46,369
Just entertaining as a jester.

342
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,780
All they're going to be able to hear is

343
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,260
the sound.

344
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
I need to confirm how much of an asshole I look like in this.

345
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,400
Do I look like a fucking asshole?

346
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,699
I need to see the mirror.

347
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,059
Okay, this is literally

348
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,059
just a shitty Halloween costume that somebody got

349
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,940
last second from a bag.

350
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
This is like, oh yeah, dude, there was a Halloween party.

351
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
You coming? Yeah, yeah, of course

352
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
I am. And I just went and got a bag Halloween

353
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,500
costume. Let me see the flute.

354
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:29,550
Let me see. This is going to be

355
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:40,690
fucking loud. Yes, Sia?

356
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:51,420
Of course.

357
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,980
Am I blowing the wrong way?

358
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:03,380
How do I do it?

359
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:11,949
That was kind of cool. Somebody make me fly away

360
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,949
like Zelda, you know what I mean?

361
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:16,380
Alright, wait, wait, wait.

362
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,199
There's some junk. Oh, no, that's okay.

363
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,199
I'll do that. Let me do this dumbass

364
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:28,880
routine. Hold on.

365
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,699
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Yes.

366
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
You're in trouble. You're in

367
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:53,920
trouble. Get him.

368
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,349
Yes, yes. Kill him.

369
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:02,690
Kill him. Why am I hunching over?

370
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,440
No, they don't hunch over like that, do they?

371
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,190
Well, I'm like, oh yes,

372
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,190
kill him. I'm like a goblin.

373
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,190
I'm supposed to be like funny. Okay.

374
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:24,159
Sia says that you're in big trouble,

375
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,000
Harry. Harry Potter.

376
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,500
I'm not supposed

377
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
to be in this movie.

378
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I don't know why I went to that. I just feel like I belong

379
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
there. Don't you understand? I feel like I belong

380
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
in that universe. Alright, let's try it again.

381
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:49,420
They don't even have kings. Alright.

382
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Oh, yes.

383
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Of course. Of course.

384
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,099
Sia says you're about to be in very

385
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,099
big trouble.

386
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,739
Oh, he's very angry.

387
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,739
Sia. Sia.

388
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,739
He's angry.

389
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:16,559
Was that loud, Sia? I'll be softer.

390
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:35,820
When do I get paid? Hopefully soon.

391
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,309
Would you like to hear a song?

392
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:45,019
I know Metallica.

393
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:48,289
I know the wind song.

394
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,289
The song of storms from

395
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,170
Zelda. That one?

396
00:39:53,170 --> 00:40:14,739
Is that more than one note?

397
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,739
Oh, you mean the juggle?

398
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:37,090
Nobody does it as good

399
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,389
as Jester the Great.

400
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:41,389
And thank you.

401
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,570
And thank you.

402
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:54,699
Thank you, especially you.

403
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,699
And thank you.

404
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:14,750
The family guy death.

405
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,460
This motherfucker's

406
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,820
in jeans, too.

407
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
Yeah, let me

408
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,039
put this up. Kill the Jester.

409
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,280
Twerk as the Jester.

410
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,039
Alright,

411
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:46,179
might as well.

412
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,179
It's twerking time.

413
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:52,320
Sia, get down.

414
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I've been a Jedi agent the whole time. Get down,

415
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,619
Sia. Back it up.

416
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:14,769
How we doing?

417
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:20,210
Okay, yep. This is gonna do. No, it's okay.

418
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,150
So pantomime each note.

419
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:58,860
I'm probably so red.

420
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:17,869
I'm like hot.

421
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,869
I'm like holding my breath to do that.

422
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,559
Because I can't breathe. I can't breathe

423
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,679
into this fucking thing. I can't

424
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,559
breathe. I have to hold

425
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,559
my breath to do this.

426
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:36,559
Oh, just pantomime every note. Hold your fucking

427
00:43:36,559 --> 00:44:03,440
breath.

428
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,739
Do what you want with that.

429
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:13,039
I don't care. Do a bong

430
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:19,309
rip? Oh,

431
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:21,309
okay, right, yeah.

432
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,309
Should I do?

433
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,309
I don't want to get out of this unless I'm gonna do everything in it.

434
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:29,539
Oh, yeah, wizard stuff.

435
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:34,980
This thing's just jingly fucking

436
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:46,500
thing out of here.

437
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Of course,

438
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
I'm gonna do fucking Harry Potter shit

439
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
again, right?

440
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Should I be more like the mouth oils?

441
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
I need a mustache, too.

442
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
That's important.

443
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
I have to do the Harry Potter shit

444
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,380
again. I'm gonna look like such

445
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,059
a moron. Hold on.

446
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,860
What are the mouth oils?

447
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:19,489
Let me do this.

448
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:26,210
Hold that for a sec. Balls

449
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,219
exposed? What are you talking about?

450
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:33,760
My balls are not exposed.

451
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Oh, I see.

452
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
They mean those balls. I get it, yeah.

453
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,900
Wait, what is that?

454
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,260
Do any of the mouth oils have

455
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,460
beards?

456
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,460
Who owns mouth oils family?

457
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,960
Who's like that mouth oil, the head

458
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,030
of mouth oil?

459
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,489
Hold on.

460
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:59,489
I kind of feel like I could do this in the camera.

461
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:06,210
You know what I mean? Who owns mouth oils family?

462
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,210
Is it like Dave mouth oil?

463
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:20,750
Hold on. How's it look?

464
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:29,969
Like a judge.

465
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:31,969
Should I just do judge shit instead?

466
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:39,650
I look like a fucking judge.

467
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:44,579
This is not a wand.

468
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,579
Harry. I don't think I'll talk like

469
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:49,070
Harry. You're not as

470
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,070
smart as all of us. You're not as smart as the rest of us.

471
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,210
They all look like this.

472
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,789
Get him. Seize him. Take him away.

473
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:00,289
My son

474
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:02,289
is way more intelligent

475
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,289
than you'll ever be, Harry.

476
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,289
And you prance around

477
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,289
and act like a little boy

478
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:10,289
while my little boy

479
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,289
also prances around too, apparently.

480
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,550
Wait, this is actually

481
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,550
okay.

482
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,840
I don't think I could put this on.

483
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,480
Should we tape it? I need my wand

484
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:39,300
too. I'm just going to tie it like a

485
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,929
regular knot. I don't care. I don't care.

486
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:49,219
That's fine.

487
00:47:49,219 --> 00:48:01,039
Okay, how's that? If you aim to

488
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,039
duel somebody, go for it for real.

489
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:19,489
Harry Potter.

490
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:23,070
Wonderful to see you

491
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,070
here. Don't you have class, Harry?

492
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,309
Class is in session

493
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:29,309
right now. Potions.

494
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,309
Heard you're quite the student.

495
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,550
You and Ron

496
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,550
and Hermione. Hermione.

497
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,070
I'm keeping an eye on you,

498
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,760
Potter. You mess up

499
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
one more time and you

500
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
talk to my boy

501
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Lucius

502
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,380
Malfoyle again like that.

503
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,840
It'll be the end of you. And if you're going

504
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
to use your wand, I might as well suggest

505
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,719
you use it. No bluffing

506
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:01,019
this time, Harry. No bluffing.

507
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:07,039
You're a little shit and you

508
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,039
always were. But you didn't

509
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:11,039
know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.

510
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:28,110
Oh.

511
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:32,019
Oh, I killed him. I think I killed

512
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:34,829
him. Oh, I

513
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,829
Harry. Harry, are you okay? Harry.

514
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:38,829
I need a doctor. Hold on.

515
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:42,480
Ividicus.

516
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,360
Okay, he's all right. He's fine.

517
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,360
He's fine. Everyone's laughing. If it's fine

518
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,329
it's okay. Harry's fine.

519
00:49:51,329 --> 00:50:03,219
Hello,

520
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,219
students. Welcome to the Defense of the

521
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:09,809
Dark Arts class. My name

522
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:11,809
is Lucius Malfoyle.

523
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,739
I'm the new teacher in town.

524
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:16,739
And yes, I'm aware that your old

525
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:18,739
teacher has perished.

526
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:23,019
Dr. McGillicuddy.

527
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:27,630
Let's go ahead and open this. It's a great

528
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,630
peppermint schnapps, by the way.

529
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:34,750
I'm sorry.

530
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,750
I'm sorry.

531
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,250
If we could all open up your

532
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,250
textbooks and go to page 200,

533
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,619
please. We're going to be

534
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,110
using, yes, yes,

535
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,110
Ron, please.

536
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,739
Page 200, we're going to be making a frog

537
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:52,739
breath potion.

538
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:55,550
You know all about that, don't you, Harry?

539
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,670
The one you used

540
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:03,409
when you killed Lucius?

541
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:07,500
Open up your textbook.

542
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,730
I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.

543
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,730
That's not the time to use that spell.

544
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,030
Didn't they ever tell you

545
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,030
you only use that spell if you mean to

546
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,909
kill another wizard? Never

547
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,909
use that spell, Harry.

548
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:26,880
And now you're going to be floating in the air.

549
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,210
There he is. Come around. Down.

550
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,599
Swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around.

551
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,739
Down. Never use that spell

552
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:41,659
in my classroom again. Turn to page 300.

553
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:47,539
We're not doing that spell anymore.

554
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,420
Fucking gross. It tastes like

555
00:51:50,420 --> 00:52:00,000
fucking Pez. There it is.

556
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,739
You know,

557
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:06,739
when I spend far too long

558
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:09,300
on this, people take

559
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
the shit that's not even funny and then they turn

560
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,300
it into something funny, so I'm very hopeful.

561
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,079
Okay, here we go.

562
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,380
Uh, no, no, period.

563
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,420
Well, class, it's been a pleasure.

564
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,659
Absolute pleasure.

565
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:28,960
But you all don't

566
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
understand the power of the Dark Lord.

567
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
And for that reason, I'm out.

568
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,460
Just like that show shark tank.

569
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:55,469
Yeah!

570
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:59,309
Oh, nice one, Harry.

571
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,309
Almost got me.

572
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,309
Holding onto my fucking balls.

573
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:08,369
This looks fucked.

574
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:17,440
I gotta go the other way. Does that work?

575
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,090
Hey, Harry. See you tomorrow on Potions, class.

576
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:25,820
How fucked is this?

577
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:37,019
Is this fucked up?

578
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:43,170
Do you look like the Witcher?

579
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:50,460
The Witcher? Hold on.

580
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,460
We gotta change into the Witcher.

581
00:53:52,460 --> 00:54:04,480
Does the Witcher have an eye patch?

582
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
This tie is

583
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
so long. Can you see this?

584
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
I look like a

585
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
10-year-old wearing dad's suit

586
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,980
to work. Do you see? This is ridiculous.

587
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
This shouldn't be like this. I feel like I'm

588
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:23,440
two feet tall. What's a character's name

589
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,409
in The Witcher? Anybody that's not The Witcher

590
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:38,460
could be anybody.

591
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,579
Geralt.

592
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:50,210
Geralt of what? Rivia?

593
00:54:50,210 --> 00:55:16,750
Geralt of Rivia?

594
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:21,539
I'll take a drink. You don't know who I am?

595
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:26,699
Geralt of Rivia. You should know.

596
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,329
Two orange juices. I'm gonna drink one now

597
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:42,929
and one later. Thank you.

598
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,940
Any witches? You seen any witches here?

599
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:50,269
No? Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.

600
00:55:50,269 --> 00:56:00,300
Hey, you. Come here.

601
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,829
Heard you were a witch. I got a letter

602
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,829
from the King of Rivia that said that you were a

603
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:10,219
witch. Are you?

604
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:13,170
I've never played this game.

605
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,170
I've never played this game. I have never played

606
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,110
any of The Witchers. Do you want to know what I know

607
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,110
about The Witcher? Okay.

608
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,059
Here's what I know about The Witcher. I know about

609
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:25,059
The Witcher is this. I know that the first game

610
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:27,059
and the second game especially. Hey,

611
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,059
yeah, sit down. You're gonna want to hear this. Sit down,

612
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:31,619
witch. I heard that the second game

613
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,619
had four to five

614
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,619
minute loading screens when you

615
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:37,619
went outside or inside of a building.

616
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,619
So that's why I never played it. I never really

617
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,619
cared for it. I actually tried to load into

618
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:43,619
one building and I couldn't get in. It took about

619
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,619
four minutes. So I installed the game.

620
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,789
The game that I'm in. You're right. The Witcher

621
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:50,099
me. You got something to say about that?

622
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:52,099
We fixed the loading times in the Enhanced Edition.

623
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:54,980
Yup. Yup.

624
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
That's the guy that played it. That's the guy that

625
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,150
played the one before the Enhanced Edition.

626
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,900
Yeah, I remember. It sucked. What you gotta say

627
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:08,099
now? Witch. Wait, hold on.

628
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,099
Let me do my, like, let me do my patented move

629
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:28,139
that I do. That's what I did in all those games.

630
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:33,059
Rick Sanchez?

631
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:42,829
Give me a gun.

632
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:51,199
I can't.

633
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:57,789
Wait, it smells. Goblin

634
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:02,269
Time? Alright, let's do Goblin Time.

635
00:58:02,269 --> 00:58:06,500
Yeah, give me the beard. The whole

636
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,179
thing smells. It all smells.

637
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,179
Why does everything that comes out of a costume bag

638
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:15,199
smell? They smell

639
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:25,889
like chemicals.

640
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:41,360
Like this? Gandalf?

641
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,360
Oh wait, no, Gandalf. Alright, I want

642
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,599
someone to put me in the PlayStation 2

643
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:57,059
Lord of the Rings game. Is it right-handed or left-handed?

644
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:42,860
I just want someone to do that.

645
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:51,980
Oh.

646
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,400
You shall

647
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:04,619
not

648
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,619
pass.

649
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:15,179
You are

650
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,739
not gonna go by me.

651
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:24,829
You are not passing

652
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:33,340
any time soon, Buster. I can do that

653
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,579
better. You shall

654
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:45,170
not pass. What's next?

655
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,170
Goblin Time? Okay.

656
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:57,789
Yeah, I'll do the chef stuff.

657
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:03,230
What the hell is this?

658
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:39,570
Peer into the orb?

659
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:54,320
Do we have an outlet?

660
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,539
How am I gonna do this?

661
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:02,510
Oh, I heard. I see

662
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,010
many things in here.

663
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:13,309
Frodo, I see you.

664
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:15,309
I see Sam. And I see

665
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:18,429
Hawaii. I want to go there

666
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:22,130
soon. After all this, of course.

667
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,559
After all this. You need to go

668
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,800
to Mordor.

669
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,420
Which, if I had to guess,

670
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,690
is a place

671
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,440
which, if I had to guess,

672
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,190
would be in this location

673
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,500
here, covered by all

674
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
the smoke and spout.

675
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Why don't you take it? I'm

676
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
sweating. I'm sweating my

677
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
ass off in this thing, Frodo.

678
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Take this from me. It's very hot.

679
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
As you can see, it's burning. It burns

680
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
my head and my face and it's making me red

681
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
and sweaty. Take it, Frodo.

682
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,130
Take it from me. Please.

683
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,130
Take it now.

684
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,130
Ow! Ow! It hurts, Frodo.

685
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:11,739
Take it!

686
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:21,340
With this?

687
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,969
Oh, no, no, no.

688
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,969
I see something horrible.

689
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:30,239
Come closer.

690
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,239
Tomorrow afternoon,

691
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:34,800
a dire thing will happen to you.

692
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,000
It will spill your

693
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,239
water on the table.

694
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:42,239
And it will drip, drip, drip over the edge

695
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,800
down to the ground.

696
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,230
And it will keep dripping

697
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,230
to a point where you have to wipe

698
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,230
under the table because water

699
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,230
got under the table side

700
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,230
and you need to really wipe under there.

701
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,230
And then under these where the cabinets are,

702
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,230
it drops into the cabinets kind of.

703
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,730
You need to open the

704
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,730
cabinet door and wipe the side of the cabinet

705
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,349
and it sucks.

706
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:08,849
Be careful. Also,

707
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:11,710
next week,

708
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,710
you will buy a lottery ticket.

709
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,710
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

710
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,139
And then that lottery ticket,

711
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:20,139
you'll scratch off the first three numbers

712
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:22,139
and you'll be a winner.

713
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:24,139
And you will scream victory. You'll be so happy about this.

714
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:28,480
Unfortunately,

715
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,039
it's a $2 winner.

716
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,039
That sucks. That's really horrible.

717
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,039
Not even a $5 winner.

718
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,039
And it was a $5 ticket, by the way.

719
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,409
Oh, the gods are getting angry now.

720
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,840
They're getting very angry, Frodo.

721
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,659
One final thing

722
01:04:44,659 --> 01:04:46,960
that I've heard, that I see

723
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,960
in this device

724
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,960
that was given to me

725
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,260
by a goblin, Frodo,

726
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,760
next weekend,

727
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
you're going to get invited to a party on Facebook.

728
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,829
You're going to say maybe.

729
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:03,329
And you're going to be kind of excited to go.

730
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:05,570
But they're going to cancel.

731
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,570
They're going to cancel it

732
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,570
right before you say

733
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,739
yes. Because you would have been

734
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:13,739
the tenth person which made

735
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:15,739
them have the party in the first place.

736
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:17,739
So you were the asshole.

737
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:19,920
If you had just said yes, you would have been

738
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,739
able to go. Oh, yep.

739
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:24,739
That one is bad.

740
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:27,039
Hot, hot, hot.

741
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:34,900
Yeah, let me get out of this.

742
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:45,710
Reddit wizard.

743
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,710
Nice shoes.

744
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:53,219
Rconfessions wizard.

745
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:55,900
What is that?

746
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,219
Rconfessions.

747
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:01,219
Consult the Funko Pop.

748
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:07,360
You need to do

749
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,360
Deckard Kane.

750
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:17,550
Sit in a stool in front of the green

751
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,550
and order an adult. Okay, I'll order some beverages.

752
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,860
Yeah, actually, let me mute

753
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,860
so you can, as I said, this is not horrible.

754
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,099
Do Sephiroth.

755
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:28,099
Every white-haired bearded

756
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:30,530
person, I can't do them all.

757
01:06:30,530 --> 01:08:05,380
Hold on, give me one sec. Okay, coming up next

758
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,380
we're going to do, I'm going to do Solid Snake.

759
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,380
Somebody said get in the box and

760
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:14,559
do snake stuff. So I'm going to do

761
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,560
some snake stuff. I need the little gun too.

762
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:27,659
Dun dun.

763
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:30,100
I picked a great time to do this.

764
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
Like in the middle of the dead of

765
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,909
summer in Vegas. A hundred plus

766
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:38,050
degrees out right now. Actually,

767
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:41,380
yeah, we do have water. I'll take some water. Dun dun.

768
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,380
Dun dun. Yeah, I'm getting Solid Snake stuff ready.

769
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:50,909
So, eye patch.

770
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:54,560
Which eye does he have it on?

771
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,560
Does it matter? I'm so sweaty.

772
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,930
I'm like

773
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,930
sweating through these clothes.

774
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:19,279
Is it the left eye or the right eye?

775
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,279
I just broke the fucking eye patch.

776
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,229
Ow, fuck.

777
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:29,140
Yeah, I'm alright. Shit. Well, how

778
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:35,090
am I supposed to put it on now? I'll just get in front.

779
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:38,739
You just guide me. Um,

780
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:51,199
does he have a headband? Okay. I got it.

781
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:55,170
I got it. Solid Snake doesn't have an

782
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,529
eye patch? What? Doesn't Snake

783
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,279
have an eye patch? Is that like a scarf?

784
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:09,340
It's a shirt. Does he look like

785
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:21,739
this? Does he have a sword?

786
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:24,689
It's Big Boss. Is it messing

787
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:29,939
with the mic? Alright, so the idea

788
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:31,939
is that I get in this and do the Solid Snake

789
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:35,329
stuff. Alright, I'm going to try.

790
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:48,819
I hope I don't knock anything over.

791
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:51,250
Okay, so it's like

792
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:57,840
there's no way I fit in this thing.

793
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:57,899
Okay. Oh! Oh,

794
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:23,819
shit. Gotcha, gotcha,

795
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:26,449
gotcha. You thought I was a box still.

796
01:12:26,449 --> 01:12:33,859
Dumbass. Oh.

797
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:37,539
I still have these on.

798
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:39,539
Oh yeah, remember Solid

799
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:42,159
Snake with his like

800
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:46,000
goblin booties? Alright,

801
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,420
what do we got next? Uh, yeah.

802
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:56,819
Oh god. That's going to be

803
01:12:56,819 --> 01:12:59,310
hard to do. Alright, I'll do it

804
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,939
though. That's going to be so awful. People are

805
01:13:01,939 --> 01:13:10,260
going to freak out at that one. Where are the

806
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:17,100
teeth? I'm just keeping the boots on. I don't care.

807
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,369
Should I like slick my hair back for this one?

808
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:31,100
Teeth? Yeah. Yeah.

809
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,729
Might as well get this one out of the way.

810
01:13:33,729 --> 01:13:38,529
I'm just sweating. There's no way it's going to fit.

811
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:40,529
I'm going to look like such a fucking creep like

812
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:46,670
this. Should I

813
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,939
have? Okay, this one is called

814
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:53,010
The Vampire at the Door.

815
01:13:53,010 --> 01:14:05,729
Oh, hi.

816
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:07,899
I'm new in the neighborhood.

817
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,899
I notice you have a really nice house.

818
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:12,779
I'd love to come in.

819
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:14,779
Could I come in?

820
01:14:14,779 --> 01:14:17,539
Could I come in your house?

821
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:19,539
I'm new in the neighborhood. Me and my family

822
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:22,029
just moved in down the street.

823
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:24,029
And I'm just trying to meet the

824
01:14:24,029 --> 01:14:27,170
neighbors. Just trying to meet the neighbors.

825
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:34,529
That's all. I love what you did

826
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:37,659
with the yard, by the way.

827
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:39,840
That beautiful grass. The grass

828
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
looks beautiful. How do you get it that

829
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
long? I don't know. Maybe you give me some

830
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,960
pointers.

831
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,329
Can I come in?

832
01:14:49,329 --> 01:14:52,449
Let me in. Let me in your

833
01:14:52,449 --> 01:14:54,619
house, please. Can I come in?

834
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:57,819
Oh, yes. Okay.

835
01:14:57,819 --> 01:15:00,260
Right, of course. I had some

836
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:03,010
dental work done and they

837
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,500
added extra length. I

838
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
wanted width. I didn't want

839
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,260
length and that's what I got.

840
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,069
Can I come in your

841
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:16,189
house? Could I come in? Can I come in

842
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:19,460
your house? No? No?

843
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,890
Okay. All right. Call me.

844
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,579
If you want to talk, call me. Call me.

845
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:29,939
Can I come in? No?

846
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:33,819
I'll wait here until I can.

847
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:37,220
That's all good. Don't worry about it.

848
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:41,310
I barely sleep.

849
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:45,149
Good night. You want some DVDs?

850
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:47,460
You want some DVDs?

851
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,720
I've got a lot of DVDs. Sharknado,

852
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,279
for one. Loaded on DVDs.

853
01:15:53,279 --> 01:16:00,689
You like drugs? Do you like drugs?

854
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,439
I've got a lot. Just let me

855
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:06,319
in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.

856
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:09,949
Bleed. Coke. That's all I got.

857
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:12,960
I don't got anything else.

858
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,869
Call me. Let me in your house.

859
01:16:17,869 --> 01:16:20,560
Let me in your house. Let me in your house.

860
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:40,659
This is a fucking TikTok video.

861
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:46,270
This is a TikTok video

862
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,579
at this point. Can we? It's a TikTok

863
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:52,350
video. You know what? I got a perfect

864
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:54,350
here you go. Perfect, perfect video

865
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,659
if you want to submit it. Just add

866
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:58,659
the TikTok UI

867
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:01,520
to that whole thing and it'll be a

868
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,520
fucking 10 out of 10. It'll be a literal 10 out of 10.

869
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,079
And add music to it and

870
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:15,170
put like a little like a chat.

871
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:27,390
Do Morbentime? Okay fine.

872
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:33,859
How would he say it? I don't know. It's Morbentime!

873
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:38,960
Huh! That's kind of like Power Rangers

874
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:55,010
right? Doesn't he like

875
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:59,359
It's Morbentime!

876
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:01,659
It's Morbentime!

877
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:46,880
I'm Morbius.

878
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,060
Go see Morbius 2 in theaters

879
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:52,510
this July. Or

880
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,569
at the $5 bin

881
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:58,380
at your local Blockbuster.

882
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,380
Either one will do. I got paid either way.

883
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:08,050
Alright.

884
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:15,390
This man went to college.

885
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,390
Yeah, long time ago.

886
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:26,220
I'm still in these stupid

887
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,979
shoes. They're getting so dirty.

888
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:33,649
Holy shit.

889
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,649
You should Morb in front of the camera. I just did.

890
01:19:35,649 --> 01:19:40,579
Okay. Oh my god. These are

891
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:45,180
so beat up. Say I'm Dr.

892
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,180
Michael Morbius.

893
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:51,520
Interested in the camera?

894
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,520
Actually, I probably should do some normal ones, right?

895
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,579
Like, hey!

896
01:19:56,579 --> 01:19:58,819
Hey, what's up? How are you? Yeah.

897
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:00,819
I just moved in. Yep.

898
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,060
New to the neighborhood. Me.

899
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,060
I love your house. I love what you're doing here.

900
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,300
You know what I mean? I love this house.

901
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,859
Really, really beautiful lawn

902
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,859
you have, too. Yeah.

903
01:20:11,859 --> 01:20:13,859
I got kids. Yeah, we all got kids, right?

904
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:15,859
Look, if you ever

905
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:18,609
it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out

906
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:20,609
and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever

907
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:22,609
or we'd have to get the families together or whatever, that's fine.

908
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,609
Like, I would just come over. I would come over.

909
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:26,609
I would come in your house. I would come over your house.

910
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:28,979
And you'd let me in, right? Like, I would come

911
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:30,979
we'd do a thing. Would you be interested?

912
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:34,050
Okay. Okay.

913
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,050
Mmm.

914
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,050
Get some mojitos.

915
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:40,050
I make an insane mojito. You don't understand.

916
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,350
It's so good.

917
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,350
You know the trick for a mojito?

918
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:46,350
Extra mint.

919
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,350
People don't like the taste of mint usually.

920
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,350
Can I come in? Can I just come in?

921
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,850
Okay.

922
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:54,850
I could show you how to make a mojito the right way

923
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,850
and not like the way that everybody else makes it

924
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,850
without the extra mint.

925
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,850
I have to come in, though. Can I come in your house?

926
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:11,659
And that's when you do the teeth thing.

927
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,989
Okay. Oh, I know.

928
01:21:14,989 --> 01:21:18,960
I'm sweating through this like crazy.

929
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,960
We're getting sweaty back.

930
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,199
I can't put a

931
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:25,199
clean shirt on. It would ruin everything.

932
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:28,590
Alright, fine. I'll do Goblin Time.

933
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,590
Jesus. Give me those.

934
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:39,869
These are perfect for Goblin Time. You're sweating.

935
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:42,180
Yeah, I know.

936
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:48,899
Alright, what do we have for Goblin Time?

937
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:56,640
You gotta look sexy.

938
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,010
Oh, I got you sweaty.

939
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:01,010
Oh, be careful.

940
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:03,010
Whoa, there's a lot in here.

941
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:05,010
Do I have anything else besides this? I have to put a mustache on for this.

942
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:12,689
Alright, let me get in the mirror and put this on.

943
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:19,979
Put on a twirly one.

944
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:33,420
I think this one will be alright for a little while.

945
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,140
Why is this a goblin? How is this a goblin?

946
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,140
Goblin Time?

947
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:43,619
Should I have something weird besides the two

948
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:47,779
like sacks of money?

949
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:49,779
Hey, fellas!

950
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:52,850
Now I just got in the dungeon!

951
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:57,329
Oh, yeah, that works.

952
01:22:57,329 --> 01:23:03,090
I'm going to look like Barney Rubble.

953
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:06,479
Alright, I'm just going to put it on here.

954
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm going to look like Barney Rubble.

955
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,029
In fact, this is a Barney Rubble costume.

956
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:18,430
We? Who?

957
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:29,170
I don't know who that is.

958
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,600
What is this going to look like?

959
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,380
Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred.

960
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,810
Oh, yeah, Fred.

961
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,930
That sounds fun to me, Fred.

962
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,930
Oh, yeah, working at the rock plant, Fred.

963
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:46,380
Yup. Okay, Fred.

964
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:50,210
That's good to hear. Good to hear, Fred.

965
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:53,409
What was I doing? Goblin Time?

966
01:23:53,409 --> 01:23:55,409
Yes!

967
01:23:55,409 --> 01:23:58,720
Oh!

968
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,720
I can't believe I stole this from those

969
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,149
adventurers!

970
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:05,520
What do we...

971
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,270
Coins! Gems!

972
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:10,270
Don't mind if I do.

973
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,270
Don't mind if I do.

974
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,510
What's this? A crown?

975
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,510
Whose crown could this be?

976
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,510
I think this is King Leonidas's.

977
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,989
No!

978
01:24:22,989 --> 01:24:26,640
Looks like I'll be shutting off.

979
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,779
I hear adventurers.

980
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:40,220
Okay.

981
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,220
These are heavy.

982
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,529
The King's treasures are so heavy.

983
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:46,529
There must be so many things in here.

984
01:24:46,529 --> 01:24:48,529
Let me take a look.

985
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:50,529
Let me see.

986
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:52,770
One is...

987
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,770
Look at...

988
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,770
Oh, my goodness.

989
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,390
So many things for me to play

990
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:01,390
with. So many things to try.

991
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,390
How many?

992
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:12,420
These are golden

993
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,170
doubloons.

994
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:20,159
The world's most valuable treasure.

995
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:25,729
I'll be taking this back to my den

996
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:32,130
immediately.

997
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:38,590
Who's that? Who's that?

998
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:45,170
Try this on for size.

999
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:47,470
Oops.

1000
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,470
Try this on for size. A power gem.

1001
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,699
Oh! Explosive!

1002
01:25:54,699 --> 01:25:56,699
Oh, another one.

1003
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,840
What do we have here?

1004
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,489
An explosive gem.

1005
01:26:03,489 --> 01:26:07,010
Oh!

1006
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:11,039
Righteous!

1007
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:13,279
Absolutely righteous!

1008
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:20,319
I'll be off then.

1009
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:23,390
Oh! Don't...

1010
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:37,600
Walk from off frame?

1011
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,170
Hold on, I gotta get all this shit out of here.

1012
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:48,159
You know what? We can move to caveman after this.

1013
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,159
A caveman wouldn't have a mustache, though.

1014
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:55,220
I know. I mean, I threw them everywhere.

1015
01:26:55,220 --> 01:27:04,369
Isn't that what they wanted?

1016
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:07,439
Isn't that what they wanted?

1017
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:09,680
Okay. So I'm just sneak?

1018
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:56,430
Alright, what's next? Caveman?

1019
01:27:56,430 --> 01:28:07,310
Grandpa? Do American Psycho.

1020
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,329
Alright, hold on.

1021
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:16,449
It's time to drink some water.

1022
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:18,449
Oh, let's do this on 120 degree Vegas day!

1023
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:26,500
Nah, I'm just kidding.

1024
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,489
Hell yeah, water.

1025
01:28:29,489 --> 01:28:31,489
Alright, I'm gonna mute because you're gonna hear my throat muscles.

1026
01:28:31,489 --> 01:30:08,619
That's gross.

1027
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:10,619
I can't. I don't know about this one.

1028
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:12,800
I don't know about this one.

1029
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
I don't know about this one.

1030
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,449
I'm supposed to be discovering fire?

1031
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:22,670
Discover fire as a caveman?

1032
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:13,199
Why would he be fighting people?

1033
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,199
Why would he?

1034
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,569
He's just beating the shit out of everybody else?

1035
01:32:17,569 --> 01:32:19,810
He's just so fucked up that he can't handle it?

1036
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:29,279
They're stealing it.

1037
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:35,300
Beating up a dinosaur.

1038
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:43,279
The caveman wears jeans.

1039
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:53,069
This is what you do in your spare time?

1040
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:55,569
Yeah, kind of.

1041
01:33:55,569 --> 01:34:06,770
That's kind of what we're doing right now.

1042
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:09,460
Alright, give me a sec. Costume change.

1043
01:34:09,460 --> 01:35:40,960
Alright, just drinking some water.

1044
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,289
So what do we got? We got cashier.

1045
01:35:44,289 --> 01:35:46,979
Yeah, we'll do artist.

1046
01:35:46,979 --> 01:36:01,619
So this is artist?

1047
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:09,170
What should I do for a mustache?

1048
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:11,170
I can't wait to do that. That's gonna be so fun.

1049
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:22,239
Should I get these out of the way?

1050
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:29,220
Just cause they're here.

1051
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:42,270
Do the guitarist. Yeah, I'm gonna do the music stuff right now.

1052
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:47,520
I can't believe I twerked as the caveman.

1053
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,760
You find fire so you twerk.

1054
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,090
That feels like a Geico commercial, doesn't it?

1055
01:37:05,149 --> 01:37:07,149
Alright, so I'm just gonna do this from various angles.

1056
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:11,760
This shirt is gonna be a different shade of gray.

1057
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:21,619
It's gonna be so wet.

1058
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:35,039
Alright, coming back.

1059
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:40,670
Okay, this one's gonna be interesting.

1060
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:51,420
So this one's play the piano in a band.

1061
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:56,350
Alright, let's see what I can do.

1062
01:37:56,350 --> 01:38:17,409
I should probably be sitting down for this.

1063
01:38:17,409 --> 01:38:19,409
You probably all just heard that, that's fine.

1064
01:38:19,409 --> 01:38:26,619
Alright, here we go.

1065
01:38:26,619 --> 01:38:29,119
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thanks for coming out.

1066
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,359
Yeah, we got a new song that we're gonna play for you here.

1067
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:35,699
What was that?

1068
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:37,869
I think I just dropped a jam out of my pocket.

1069
01:38:37,869 --> 01:38:39,869
Well, maybe I should trade it in.

1070
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:41,869
Alright, yeah, we're gonna play a new song.

1071
01:38:41,869 --> 01:38:43,869
This one is something we've been working on for a long time.

1072
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:46,050
I hope you all enjoy it.

1073
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:48,930
It doesn't have a name, it's currently untitled.

1074
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,930
So that's what we're gonna do.

1075
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,930
It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.

1076
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:54,930
Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.

1077
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:58,130
It's gonna be peppy, it's gonna be a lot of upbeat.

1078
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,819
So I'll hopefully see somebody out there dancing.

1079
01:39:00,819 --> 01:39:06,340
Okay, and a one, two, a one, two, three, four.

1080
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:45,539
Okay, alright now, speed it up.

1081
01:39:45,539 --> 01:40:00,500
Yeah, thank you.

1082
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,180
Thank you so much.

1083
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:05,180
No, sit down, sit down.

1084
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:08,000
No reason for that.

1085
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,369
Okay, if you're gonna stand.

1086
01:40:10,369 --> 01:40:12,989
Thank you, wow, thank you.

1087
01:40:12,989 --> 01:40:16,449
We've been working on that for like, what, two weeks?

1088
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:19,390
Three weeks now.

1089
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:22,460
Yeah, John came up with the lyrics.

1090
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:24,460
You don't have to stand.

1091
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,460
Sit down, sit down, no, sit down.

1092
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,789
Alright, okay, thank you.

1093
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:34,380
Thank you.

1094
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:36,380
This thing's clearly inflatable.

1095
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,380
Alright, let's do the next one with the fucking guitar.

1096
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:45,550
Sitting or standing, what do you think?

1097
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:51,630
I should probably be up for this.

1098
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:56,609
Probably standing, right?

1099
01:40:56,609 --> 01:41:02,619
Stand, yeah, yeah, this is the guitar.

1100
01:41:02,619 --> 01:41:08,619
Look, I didn't, I'm not gonna go

1101
01:41:08,619 --> 01:41:12,619
and buy like a $500 acoustic guitar.

1102
01:41:12,619 --> 01:41:22,100
It looks fine on camera, it looks alright.

1103
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:28,220
So do you think knee?

1104
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:32,180
Knee like this probably, like that.

1105
01:41:32,180 --> 01:42:22,670
So it's gonna be like bang.

1106
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:31,569
You can use this part if you want.

1107
01:42:31,569 --> 01:42:36,539
Didn't like ACDC do this shit?

1108
01:42:36,539 --> 01:42:41,859
ACDC would be like,

1109
01:42:41,859 --> 01:43:09,500
wait, what, we still have close ups?

1110
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:56,640
Oh yeah, yeah.

1111
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:02,270
Alright, any more instruments?

1112
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:05,470
Should I play the accordion when I have like

1113
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:18,979
the chef outfit on?

1114
01:44:18,979 --> 01:44:27,170
Okay, we'll do struggling to open a jar.

1115
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:29,170
Give me, give me it, I got it, give it to me.

1116
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:33,949
God.

1117
01:44:33,949 --> 01:44:38,500
You may get a little bit work in here, but alright.

1118
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,409
Put your sink on.

1119
01:44:45,409 --> 01:44:50,850
Hot water, works.

1120
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:56,159
What did you fucking do to this thing?

1121
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:05,119
I'm gonna break the jar if I keep doing that.

1122
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,119
Do you have one of those things you can open it with

1123
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:12,500
like a bottle opener thing?

1124
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:21,840
You can't look at me, don't look at me while I do it.

1125
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,840
Don't look at me when I try to do it, cause I get nervous.

1126
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:30,510
I'm just sweating.

1127
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:32,510
It's already open.

1128
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:36,859
Huh.

1129
01:45:36,859 --> 01:45:39,300
Now that's interesting, isn't it?

1130
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:44,659
Ship was already open.

1131
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:46,659
Ah, there it is.

1132
01:45:46,659 --> 01:45:49,020
There it is.

1133
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:51,020
See, I can do it, I can open jars.

1134
01:45:51,020 --> 01:46:02,020
I'm strong.

1135
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:07,899
Nice back.

1136
01:46:07,899 --> 01:46:11,810
Nice back sweat.

1137
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:13,810
Somebody said you let out the wasps.

1138
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:22,189
Oh, that's a good one, alright.

1139
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:26,739
Well, I gotta be in the gray

1140
01:46:26,739 --> 01:46:28,739
in the jeans to match all the other

1141
01:46:28,739 --> 01:46:33,859
things.

1142
01:46:33,859 --> 01:46:35,859
Oh yeah, this is gonna bounce around if I do that.

1143
01:46:35,859 --> 01:46:38,029
Actually, it should go inside.

1144
01:46:38,029 --> 01:46:40,720
Yeah, let me mute for a second

1145
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:44,300
cause I wanna put this back in.

1146
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,300
These little things are great, these things are awesome.

1147
01:46:46,300 --> 01:47:01,149
One sec.

1148
01:47:01,149 --> 01:47:07,810
Somebody said back piss.

1149
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:10,750
Do a western standoff, okay.

1150
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,930
Oh, that's already one, okay.

1151
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:14,930
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that we're gonna be going through.

1152
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:19,090
And I got plenty of time, so I don't wanna like

1153
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:21,090
rush through everything and get like

1154
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:23,090
winded in three hours.

1155
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:25,090
We're here for like five hours, so there's a lot of

1156
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:32,130
shit I'm gonna do.

1157
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:37,439
Should I do the artist stuff right now?

1158
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:40,380
I think that makes sense.

1159
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,380
Oh, the scout ton. How do you do it?

1160
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:46,029
You check your pulse.

1161
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:52,289
So I'm like, I'm not even winded.

1162
01:47:52,289 --> 01:48:01,760
Oh, I need a head.

1163
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:17,100
Oh, headphones, yeah.

1164
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,100
That's gonna look so funny.

1165
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:52,750
I'm not even winded. What's the engineer stuff?

1166
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:57,489
Oh, should I just be like on a construction yard?

1167
01:48:57,489 --> 01:49:04,399
Oh my god, super fucking Mario.

1168
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:09,390
Super Mario?

1169
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:11,390
A guard hat?

1170
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:13,630
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1171
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,630
Alright.

1172
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:17,630
Super, I'm gonna be Super Mario

1173
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:19,630
with a, this is gonna be

1174
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:23,279
fucked up, isn't it?

1175
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:25,279
Alright, let me change. Let's get the Mario shit

1176
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:29,569
out of the way. Costume change.

1177
01:49:29,569 --> 01:49:32,829
Do a backwards long jump.

1178
01:49:32,829 --> 01:49:36,029
Oh, you better believe it.

1179
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:39,100
I'm gonna do all the speed run shit.

1180
01:49:39,100 --> 01:53:19,520
I'll be right back. Hold on a second.

1181
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,520
What is this costume?

1182
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,760
What the fuck

1183
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,760
is this costume?

1184
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,760
This is a Super Mario costume. Why is it

1185
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,189
like this?

1186
01:53:30,189 --> 01:53:32,189
Okay, well,

1187
01:53:32,189 --> 01:53:34,189
I'm

1188
01:53:34,189 --> 01:54:03,119
muting. Oh, this is fucked up.

1189
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,119
This is fucked up.

1190
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,119
Alright, I'm back. Can you guys hear me?

1191
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:09,119
Where's the hat?

1192
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,810
Is it the engineer or do you want the Mario hat?

1193
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:13,810
It's just the Mario shit. This is way too

1194
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:15,810
low. This is weird.

1195
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:20,350
Alright, what was it?

1196
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:22,350
I need a Mario mustache.

1197
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:24,350
And I gotta get the voice down too, like, oh!

1198
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:26,659
Whoa! Whoa!

1199
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:29,340
It's a me!

1200
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,029
Mario! Hello!

1201
01:54:32,029 --> 01:54:35,220
Oh! Oh!

1202
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:37,899
Okie dokie!

1203
01:54:37,899 --> 01:54:42,060
Hello!

1204
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:44,060
This is my big role. This is my big break.

1205
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:46,430
I feel like I'm in the wings

1206
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:48,430
during a theater production.

1207
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:51,310
And they just, like, the kids can't wait

1208
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:56,109
to watch me.

1209
01:54:56,109 --> 01:54:58,109
Should this be this, I feel like, I'm like in a clown

1210
01:54:58,109 --> 01:55:03,489
costume. I'm just gonna wear

1211
01:55:03,489 --> 01:55:06,430
socks. I don't even care.

1212
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,430
How does it go? Like this? Does it go up or down?

1213
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:10,859
Like that? No, no,

1214
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:12,859
the other way. Oh, can you help me? Yeah.

1215
01:55:12,859 --> 01:55:17,020
It goes like that? Yeah. Alright.

1216
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:19,899
Are you needed? No. Oh.

1217
01:55:19,899 --> 01:55:31,920
Oh no. Hello!

1218
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,920
You should be in bare feet.

1219
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,289
No!

1220
01:55:36,289 --> 01:55:38,289
That's wicked funny though.

1221
01:55:38,289 --> 01:55:40,289
That's wicked funny.

1222
01:55:40,289 --> 01:55:42,289
He's in bare feet.

1223
01:55:44,289 --> 01:55:50,670
Oh. Just bare

1224
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:54,510
ass feet. Okay, how's that look?

1225
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:58,909
Do I look alright?

1226
01:55:58,909 --> 01:56:01,090
Yeah, it's a little scorched.

1227
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,090
It looks like I have, I don't, this is like

1228
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:05,710
down too low. This looks

1229
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:08,460
inappropriate.

1230
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,460
This looks inappropriate.

1231
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,899
Doesn't this look inappropriate?

1232
01:56:12,899 --> 01:56:17,439
This is inappropriate. Oh, hello!

1233
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:19,439
It's a me, Mario!

1234
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:21,439
Oh! Okie dokie!

1235
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:23,439
Oh! Ha ha!

1236
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:25,439
Hee hee! Oh! Bingo!

1237
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:27,439
Oh! Ha ha! Hee hee!

1238
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:33,970
Ho ho! Oh!

1239
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:36,590
Where's Luigi? Where's

1240
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:41,840
Luigi? Can we get this out?

1241
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:48,619
So what are some of the, I gotta, okay,

1242
01:56:48,619 --> 01:56:53,810
let me do some Mario stuff. Alright.

1243
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:59,810
Hoo! Hoo!

1244
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:02,430
It's like, meep!

1245
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:04,430
Meahoo! Take that audio.

1246
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:08,829
Meahoo! Meahoo!

1247
01:57:08,829 --> 01:57:12,029
Take that audio. And it's like

1248
01:57:12,029 --> 01:57:23,939
Hoo! Meahoo! Meahoo!

1249
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:26,560
Meahoo!

1250
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,949
I'm probably fucking up this audio so bad.

1251
01:57:29,949 --> 01:57:35,520
Meahoo! Meahoo!

1252
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,520
Meahoo!

1253
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:43,649
Hoo!

1254
01:57:43,649 --> 01:57:54,659
BLJs! Be careful!

1255
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:56,659
I've got a big stomach, I'll be fine!

1256
01:57:56,659 --> 01:58:03,420
Alright, let's get some walking.

1257
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,289
I'm gonna burp. And I can't hide it.

1258
01:58:06,289 --> 01:58:15,500
Hoo! Meahoo! Okie dokie!

1259
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:20,609
Oh no! Bowser!

1260
01:58:20,609 --> 01:58:39,470
Bowser!

1261
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:41,470
Meahoo! Kicka coo! Meahoo!

1262
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:43,710
Kicka coo! Meahoo!

1263
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:46,399
Kicka coo! Meahoo!

1264
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:49,659
Fuck outta here! Sit the fuck down,

1265
01:58:49,659 --> 01:58:51,659
Bowser! Kicka coo! Meahoo,

1266
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:56,779
motherfucker! Okie dokie!

1267
01:58:56,779 --> 01:59:24,479
Alright, let's get in the Mario Kart.

1268
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:27,100
Do we have a steering wheel?

1269
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:36,579
It's a circle.

1270
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:39,649
Oh, nah, I'll just hold it

1271
01:59:39,649 --> 01:59:43,279
like this. How's it, does it look good?

1272
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:50,579
This is kinda comfy, I like this.

1273
01:59:50,579 --> 01:59:53,779
Do we look alright? I'll do a bunch from the other side too.

1274
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:11,630
Alright, I gotta center. I've got

1275
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:14,640
to center, I've got to center.

1276
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,970
Ok, welcome to Mario Kart.

1277
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:19,970
I'll select your player.

1278
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:22,399
It's me, Mario.

1279
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:29,869
Here we go!

1280
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:44,899
This is a big turn!

1281
02:00:55,569 --> 02:01:01,970
Bingo!

1282
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:06,829
It's a red shell!

1283
02:01:20,449 --> 02:01:30,479
This is very

1284
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:33,039
hard on Mario. This is a hard

1285
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:35,409
car to drive. Mario!

1286
02:01:35,409 --> 02:01:42,180
Mario!

1287
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,979
Very close!

1288
02:01:55,979 --> 02:02:08,210
Very close! Here I go!

1289
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:10,210
Here I go! Here I go!

1290
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:12,210
Here I go! Here I go! Here I go!

1291
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:17,710
Oh, mamma mia!

1292
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:25,380
Hey, Toad! You little shit!

1293
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:31,229
Hey, Toad! I'm

1294
02:02:31,229 --> 02:02:33,229
passing you again for the third time this race!

1295
02:02:37,779 --> 02:02:43,329
Oh, no!

1296
02:02:43,329 --> 02:02:47,550
Mario need an alibi!

1297
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:59,500
Oh! Oh, yes!

1298
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:02,130
Oh, I'm selling

1299
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:04,369
Cookie Monster. I'm doing Cookie Monster,

1300
02:03:04,369 --> 02:03:06,369
not even Mario. Alright, reset.

1301
02:03:06,369 --> 02:03:11,489
Three, two, oh, just here I go!

1302
02:03:11,489 --> 02:03:13,489
Oh, I love

1303
02:03:13,489 --> 02:03:15,489
cookies! Oh, cookies!

1304
02:03:15,489 --> 02:03:22,079
Let's see if you can

1305
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:39,739
deal with this! Mario will drive

1306
02:03:39,739 --> 02:03:52,020
on his feet!

1307
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:57,649
Get away!

1308
02:03:57,649 --> 02:04:00,979
Get this away from me!

1309
02:04:00,979 --> 02:04:05,579
Oh!

1310
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:16,850
Super moves!

1311
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:46,340
Toad! What else do you want from me?

1312
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:52,670
Hotel Mario? What the fuck?

1313
02:04:52,670 --> 02:05:01,939
Walk in? Oh, okay.

1314
02:05:01,939 --> 02:05:07,869
No! No!

1315
02:05:07,869 --> 02:05:10,050
No! How do you do it?

1316
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:13,439
It's like, no! She's looking at me

1317
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,020
like I'm fucking crazy. No!

1318
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:26,109
Toaster goes in

1319
02:05:26,109 --> 02:05:28,109
the toaster! Toast

1320
02:05:28,109 --> 02:05:30,109
no! Toast goes in the

1321
02:05:30,109 --> 02:05:32,109
toaster! Is that in the same thing?

1322
02:05:32,109 --> 02:05:39,390
Is that in that? Tuck that in?

1323
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:43,489
There's a tag!

1324
02:05:43,489 --> 02:05:45,729
There's this song?

1325
02:05:45,729 --> 02:05:50,340
When you do the Mario, it's

1326
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,340
swing your arms from side to side.

1327
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:54,340
Come on, it's time to go! Do the

1328
02:05:54,340 --> 02:06:06,939
Mario! Okay.

1329
02:06:06,939 --> 02:06:08,939
Swing your arms from

1330
02:06:08,939 --> 02:06:10,939
side to side. Come on, and everyone

1331
02:06:10,939 --> 02:06:12,939
go do the Mario! Swing your

1332
02:06:12,939 --> 02:06:14,939
arms from side to side.

1333
02:06:14,939 --> 02:06:16,939
Come on, let's go! Let's do the Mario!

1334
02:06:16,939 --> 02:06:21,420
Is that the Mario for you?

1335
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:23,600
Yeah, who that one?

1336
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,600
Hey, yeah, who that one?

1337
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:31,170
Bowser. Does he go like this?

1338
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:43,710
He's like, I don't know the whole song.

1339
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:49,859
Any more Mario shit?

1340
02:06:49,859 --> 02:06:55,359
The accordion is Mario?

1341
02:06:55,359 --> 02:06:59,520
Wait.

1342
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:02,210
Hold on.

1343
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:04,210
I wrote this song

1344
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:33,819
for Luigi.

1345
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:35,819
And every single person watching

1346
02:07:35,819 --> 02:07:37,819
wanted to turn the audio off.

1347
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:44,159
That was for you, Luigi.

1348
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,159
I can't wait to be the annoying waiter.

1349
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,159
He'll be like, oh,

1350
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:52,060
how are you?

1351
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:54,060
And I'll take an extra tip, by the way.

1352
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:56,060
At least 60 percent.

1353
02:07:56,060 --> 02:08:12,239
Enjoy your dinner.

1354
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:18,060
Any more Mario?

1355
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:20,060
The car's just in the corner.

1356
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:23,010
You already just did this, right?

1357
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:26,020
Yeah, go up the stairs.

1358
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:28,020
Do you want Mario drug PSA?

1359
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:35,420
Biyahoo!

1360
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:37,420
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1361
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:41,329
Bwah!

1362
02:08:41,329 --> 02:08:43,890
Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Super Mario.

1363
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:46,960
We've made a lot of jokes here today.

1364
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,960
We've had a lot of fun. And I'm an actor.

1365
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:51,710
But let me just be the first to tell you

1366
02:08:51,710 --> 02:08:53,710
that, you know, it's not fun. What is not

1367
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:57,170
is totally biyahoo. Drugs

1368
02:08:57,170 --> 02:09:00,109
and alcohol. Stay away from them.

1369
02:09:00,109 --> 02:09:02,859
If somebody tries to pressure you

1370
02:09:02,859 --> 02:09:04,859
into drinking or smoking,

1371
02:09:04,859 --> 02:09:07,300
tell them with the hardest

1372
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,300
of hearts, no,

1373
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:12,500
I don't need to do that. We can get back

1374
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:15,760
to the playing and games now.

1375
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,760
But I wanted to make sure that that was a big biyahoo.

1376
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:20,510
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1377
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:22,689
I saw you laughing in the corner.

1378
02:09:22,689 --> 02:09:24,689
What's wrong?

1379
02:09:24,689 --> 02:09:26,689
What's wrong with me?

1380
02:09:26,689 --> 02:09:28,689
What's wrong?

1381
02:09:28,689 --> 02:09:30,689
What's wrong with me?

1382
02:09:30,689 --> 02:09:32,689
I thought I had like residue on my face.

1383
02:09:32,689 --> 02:09:34,689
Okay.

1384
02:09:34,689 --> 02:09:36,689
Let me try again. One more time. One more time.

1385
02:09:36,689 --> 02:09:46,930
Bwah! Bwah!

1386
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:50,579
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1387
02:09:50,579 --> 02:09:56,340
Hi, boys and girls.

1388
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:59,260
I'm Jeremy Albertson, aka

1389
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:01,260
the actor of Super Mario.

1390
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:04,210
But you know what's not biyahoo?

1391
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:06,640
And what's not cool? Drugs and alcohol.

1392
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:09,140
If somebody pressures you

1393
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:11,140
into smoking or drinking,

1394
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,869
tell them no.

1395
02:10:13,869 --> 02:10:16,050
And you can tell them so long.

1396
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:18,670
So long, King Bowser.

1397
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:21,550
Take it from me.

1398
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:23,550
I live a pretty cool life, don't you think?

1399
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:26,050
Fuck!

1400
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:28,050
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1401
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:33,539
One more, one more, one more, one more.

1402
02:10:33,539 --> 02:10:35,710
Oh! Bowser!

1403
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:37,710
It's a Bowser!

1404
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:39,710
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1405
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:45,859
Woah!

1406
02:10:45,859 --> 02:10:48,670
You know what's not funny? Something that's not completely

1407
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:52,300
biyahoo. Drugs and alcohol.

1408
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:54,300
Hi, everybody. I'm the actor that plays

1409
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:56,300
Super Mario, and I just want to make sure that everyone's aware

1410
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,300
if you're ever pressured

1411
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,300
by drugs, alcohol,

1412
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:02,300
or anything naughty at all,

1413
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:04,479
say no.

1414
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:06,479
There's no pressure at all.

1415
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:08,659
Don't let somebody pressure you

1416
02:11:08,659 --> 02:11:11,600
into taking something you don't want to do.

1417
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:14,739
And with that, it's time to so long, King Bowser.

1418
02:11:14,739 --> 02:11:19,340
Woah!

1419
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:23,119
Woah!

1420
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:25,119
You can use one of those.

1421
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:32,609
Whatever you want to use it for.

1422
02:11:32,609 --> 02:11:34,609
Do one in Mario character?

1423
02:11:34,609 --> 02:11:36,850
Okay. Okay, alright.

1424
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:41,579
Okay.

1425
02:11:41,579 --> 02:11:43,579
Oh, god damn it. Alright, I'll try.

1426
02:11:48,000 --> 02:12:01,279
Biyahoo!

1427
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:04,220
Mustache is so fucked up.

1428
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:06,779
Okay, I think it's on.

1429
02:12:06,779 --> 02:12:09,789
I got it.

1430
02:12:09,789 --> 02:12:11,789
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1431
02:12:11,789 --> 02:12:16,850
Bowser!

1432
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:22,159
Oh, boy.

1433
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:24,159
It's impossible. I think it actually

1434
02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:26,590
might be impossible.

1435
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:28,770
I'll give it one more try.

1436
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:30,770
Oh, fuck. Okay.

1437
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:33,460
I gotta like, just shut up and get into it.

1438
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:36,140
God damn it.

1439
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:42,029
Because I just imagine watching this on TV

1440
02:12:42,029 --> 02:12:44,029
and it's just like, it's so stupid.

1441
02:12:44,029 --> 02:12:48,640
Biyahoo!

1442
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,640
Biyahoo!

1443
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:53,439
Oh, Bowser!

1444
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:55,439
Ha ha ha ha!

1445
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:57,920
Oh!

1446
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,920
Boys and girls, it's a me,

1447
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:02,420
Mario. Let me tell you

1448
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:04,779
something. If somebody wants to tell

1449
02:13:04,779 --> 02:13:07,090
you to take drugs,

1450
02:13:07,090 --> 02:13:09,329
you always say no. You say,

1451
02:13:09,329 --> 02:13:11,329
Luigi, try to drink

1452
02:13:11,329 --> 02:13:13,329
and do drugs one time.

1453
02:13:13,329 --> 02:13:15,329
And I said, no! And he said,

1454
02:13:15,329 --> 02:13:17,630
Mario! And I said, no!

1455
02:13:17,630 --> 02:13:19,630
Fucking god damn it.

1456
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:21,630
The mustache came off.

1457
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:27,199
That one was the one,

1458
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,199
too. That was the take.

1459
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:31,199
And I could feel it come off.

1460
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:34,399
Oh, fuck. I could feel it

1461
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:40,739
come off. Alright, I'm gonna give this one

1462
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:43,739
more attempt and we have to move on.

1463
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:48,909
I'm so sweaty. Okay.

1464
02:13:48,909 --> 02:13:52,859
Hello!

1465
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:58,560
Okay, you can do this, Mario.

1466
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,000
You can do this, Mario.

1467
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1468
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,850
Bowser! Hello, boys

1469
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:11,020
and girls. It's a me, Mario.

1470
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:13,779
Let me tell you something

1471
02:14:13,779 --> 02:14:16,779
about drugs and alcohol. My brother

1472
02:14:16,779 --> 02:14:18,779
Luigi would also say this,

1473
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:21,090
too. We both would say this.

1474
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:25,300
Shit!

1475
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,779
Biyahoo!

1476
02:14:27,779 --> 02:14:31,619
I gotta give it more than that.

1477
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:34,430
Biyahoo! Biyahoo!

1478
02:14:34,430 --> 02:14:37,060
Bowser! I'll deal with you later.

1479
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:40,500
Hello! Boys and girls.

1480
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,500
It's a me, Mario.

1481
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,989
Let me tell you something about...

1482
02:14:44,989 --> 02:14:49,020
Just cut them together, okay?

1483
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:53,060
Let me tell you something about

1484
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:55,550
drugs and alcohol.

1485
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:57,550
You should never take any drugs.

1486
02:14:57,550 --> 02:14:59,550
Never. Mario wouldn't. Luigi

1487
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:03,199
wouldn't. Toad? Maybe.

1488
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:05,439
But we don't need to talk

1489
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:07,439
about Toad. Oh!

1490
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:11,859
Oh!

1491
02:15:11,859 --> 02:15:14,029
It's a me, Mario. I want to talk to you

1492
02:15:14,029 --> 02:15:16,340
about drugs. Boys and girls,

1493
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:18,340
don't do drugs.

1494
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:20,340
You don't have to do them. Don't feel

1495
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:22,340
pressured to take drugs or drink.

1496
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:24,340
If anyone ever pressures you,

1497
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:26,340
tell them Mario said,

1498
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:28,340
so long, King Bowser, and they will

1499
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:30,340
leave you alone. No!

1500
02:15:30,340 --> 02:15:32,340
Hello!

1501
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:34,340
It's a me, Mario.

1502
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:36,340
I have to do a drug

1503
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:38,340
PSA. Okay. I'm done.

1504
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:40,340
I can't.

1505
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:42,640
I can't do it. I can't. That was

1506
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:45,260
the end.

1507
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:47,260
He's on drugs.

1508
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,819
He's on drugs.

1509
02:15:49,819 --> 02:15:51,819
He's like

1510
02:15:51,819 --> 02:15:53,819
fucked up. He's fucking crazy.

1511
02:15:53,819 --> 02:15:55,819
He's running around like a psychopath.

1512
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:57,819
He's

1513
02:15:57,819 --> 02:16:00,000
on something. Oh my

1514
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:06,829
God.

1515
02:16:06,829 --> 02:16:09,840
Do the Bowser throw?

1516
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:14,899
Alright, fine.

1517
02:16:14,899 --> 02:16:16,899
Yahoo!

1518
02:16:22,479 --> 02:16:27,220
So long, King Bowser!

1519
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:29,220
And somebody that's King Bowser needs

1520
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:31,520
to understand. Boys and girls,

1521
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,819
don't do drugs. If you do

1522
02:16:33,819 --> 02:16:35,819
drugs, you'll end up like King

1523
02:16:35,819 --> 02:16:38,510
Bowser over there. Dead.

1524
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:45,680
Is he dead? I don't know.

1525
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:58,459
So long.

1526
02:16:58,459 --> 02:17:00,459
Is that what he said?

1527
02:17:00,459 --> 02:17:04,479
Oh my God.

1528
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:06,479
Alright, any more Mario shooters? Is that it?

1529
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:10,450
So long, King Bowser.

1530
02:17:10,450 --> 02:17:15,629
Anything else

1531
02:17:15,629 --> 02:17:19,280
we want to do as Mario? Happy Pride Month.

1532
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,579
Yeah, it's the last day of Pride Month, right?

1533
02:17:21,579 --> 02:17:23,579
Oh my God, I'm going to take the whole thing down,

1534
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:25,579
Luigi.

1535
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:27,579
Luigi, I almost just took down the whole

1536
02:17:27,579 --> 02:17:31,090
camera.

1537
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:34,219
Did it move? I don't think it did, right?

1538
02:17:34,219 --> 02:17:38,450
Let's just make sure you can still see me.

1539
02:17:38,450 --> 02:17:40,450
Did the camera move? Maybe they

1540
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:44,159
can tell you. Did it move or are we good?

1541
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:56,860
How about now? Am I good here?

1542
02:17:56,860 --> 02:18:01,979
Okay, good. So, that's fine.

1543
02:18:07,969 --> 02:18:18,979
Any more Mario stuff before we move on?

1544
02:18:18,979 --> 02:18:22,819
Lose a life? Do a ground pound,

1545
02:18:22,819 --> 02:18:24,819
okay. Yeah, I keep trying to go this

1546
02:18:24,819 --> 02:18:26,819
I'm so stupid. I keep trying to go

1547
02:18:26,819 --> 02:18:29,950
to the left. Okay, ground pound.

1548
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:34,670
So it's like,

1549
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:37,659
like that?

1550
02:18:37,659 --> 02:19:06,260
Like, Luigi. I'm fucking

1551
02:19:06,260 --> 02:19:09,200
done with this job. Never fucking doing Mario

1552
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:17,379
ever again.

1553
02:19:17,379 --> 02:19:19,379
No, I can't. I can't.

1554
02:19:19,379 --> 02:19:21,379
So what is that? What is that

1555
02:19:21,379 --> 02:19:23,809
image of? I hate this. It's a fucking

1556
02:19:23,809 --> 02:19:25,809
pregnant Mario thing.

1557
02:19:25,809 --> 02:19:27,809
Oh my God.

1558
02:19:27,809 --> 02:19:31,780
That's a meme. That's a meme

1559
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:34,719
right there. Whoopsie daisy.

1560
02:19:34,719 --> 02:19:39,840
Whoopsie. Alright, so should I

1561
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,020
do the hard hat Mario? Wait, wasn't

1562
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:48,540
this like Mario Odyssey?

1563
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:52,049
Hey, look, bud. I'm an

1564
02:19:52,049 --> 02:19:54,670
engineer. That means I solve problems.

1565
02:19:54,670 --> 02:19:56,909
I solve practical problems.

1566
02:19:56,909 --> 02:20:02,670
So wait, does the mustache

1567
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:06,579
off as the engineer? I guess that's

1568
02:20:06,579 --> 02:20:14,129
true, right? Build a sentry

1569
02:20:14,129 --> 02:20:20,270
That's Mario? This stomach

1570
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:22,270
is going to get me in a lot of trouble.

1571
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:25,899
Oh, hey, look, bud.

1572
02:20:25,899 --> 02:20:32,670
Sentry going up. Glasses?

1573
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:40,479
Oh, yeah. Uh, these ones are good.

1574
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:46,420
God damn it.

1575
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:49,360
Damn it. Oh, damn it.

1576
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:54,909
Sentry going up.

1577
02:20:54,909 --> 02:20:56,909
Good night, Irene.

1578
02:20:56,909 --> 02:21:04,129
Building a dispenser. I'm going to push

1579
02:21:04,129 --> 02:21:07,969
that car. Teleporter going up.

1580
02:21:07,969 --> 02:21:13,200
Ow. Ow my leg.

1581
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:19,280
Let's get a teleporter

1582
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:26,510
up here.

1583
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:33,379
Ha ha ha.

1584
02:21:33,379 --> 02:21:35,379
Ha ha ha.

1585
02:21:35,379 --> 02:21:47,969
Guitar?

1586
02:21:47,969 --> 02:21:51,299
Oh, sitting down.

1587
02:21:51,299 --> 02:21:53,299
Sentry down. Oh, alright, yeah. Let's do that.

1588
02:21:53,299 --> 02:22:01,659
Sentry down.

1589
02:22:01,659 --> 02:22:04,350
I can do better.

1590
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:08,059
Hey, let me do it like every player does.

1591
02:22:08,059 --> 02:22:12,190
Right.

1592
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:17,819
Sentry down.

1593
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:38,030
What's next? Oh, get backstabbed?

1594
02:22:38,030 --> 02:22:45,139
We need a teleporter

1595
02:22:45,139 --> 02:22:47,139
right here.

1596
02:22:47,139 --> 02:23:06,209
Oh, I'm on fire. What does he say?

1597
02:23:06,209 --> 02:23:08,899
I'm on fire. Fire, fire, fire.

1598
02:23:08,899 --> 02:23:10,899
Fire, fire.

1599
02:23:10,899 --> 02:23:22,340
Oh, fire.

1600
02:23:42,299 --> 02:23:45,360
Medic, medic.

1601
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:48,500
You can edit that in.

1602
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:50,500
You have sound effects editing capabilities.

1603
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:57,540
What's hillbilly?

1604
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:10,700
Should I sit in a chair? Seeing a tornado.

1605
02:24:10,700 --> 02:24:12,700
Hillbilly seeing a tornado.

1606
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:15,889
Maybe no gloves.

1607
02:24:15,889 --> 02:24:22,989
With the Mario gloves on.

1608
02:24:22,989 --> 02:24:24,989
Hillbilly seeing a tornado.

1609
02:24:24,989 --> 02:24:26,989
Is this the beard? No, that's the

1610
02:24:26,989 --> 02:24:43,120
hat. Isn't this what Mario just looks like

1611
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:46,379
without his hat on? If Mario

1612
02:24:46,379 --> 02:24:48,379
doesn't have his hat on, this is what he looks like, alright?

1613
02:24:48,379 --> 02:24:50,940
When Mario's hat comes off in the games,

1614
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:56,829
he looks like this. No gloves?

1615
02:24:56,829 --> 02:25:02,510
Oh, man.

1616
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:06,219
What's that? I think that's a tornado.

1617
02:25:06,219 --> 02:25:08,719
Oh, that's a tornado

1618
02:25:08,719 --> 02:25:11,540
right there. That's a tornado.

1619
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:13,899
We gotta get everybody

1620
02:25:13,899 --> 02:25:16,270
inside. Get everybody.

1621
02:25:16,270 --> 02:25:18,510
Wait a minute.

1622
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:20,690
I gotta save him. I gotta

1623
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:22,690
save him from the tornado.

1624
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:25,309
Come here.

1625
02:25:25,309 --> 02:25:30,620
I got you. There you go.

1626
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:35,149
You landed in the bed.

1627
02:25:35,149 --> 02:25:37,149
It's getting closer. It's getting closer.

1628
02:25:37,149 --> 02:25:40,020
Oh, we're gonna get

1629
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:42,020
the cows in or the chickens.

1630
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:46,430
Get the chickens in. I'm done with

1631
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:57,170
this one. This one's over.

1632
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:59,170
None of that is usable.

1633
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:07,040
So Mario can come off.

1634
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:15,409
Give me the Mario hat for a second.

1635
02:26:15,409 --> 02:26:17,409
Alright, stuff the hair in here.

1636
02:26:17,409 --> 02:26:19,969
This is important.

1637
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:21,969
Yeah, but try to get all the hair in here.

1638
02:26:21,969 --> 02:26:31,180
As much of the hair you can get in there

1639
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:33,180
as possible.

1640
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:40,989
I gotta nail this, otherwise

1641
02:26:40,989 --> 02:26:42,989
this is the only chance I have to do this.

1642
02:26:42,989 --> 02:26:46,000
Can you do your front? I'll do your back.

1643
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:56,989
Where's the mustache?

1644
02:26:56,989 --> 02:27:02,159
Thank you.

1645
02:27:02,159 --> 02:27:05,540
I'm gonna give the...

1646
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:07,540
What? What's wrong?

1647
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:09,540
Yeah, they are. That's fucking gross.

1648
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:15,489
You didn't hear any of that.

1649
02:27:15,489 --> 02:27:18,299
Alright, I got one...

1650
02:27:18,299 --> 02:27:22,340
Oh my god, these are gross.

1651
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:25,219
It's like as if you dunked these in water.

1652
02:27:25,219 --> 02:27:27,219
Alright, I gotta try this once.

1653
02:27:27,219 --> 02:27:29,219
I don't know why I'm so into the drug PSA

1654
02:27:29,219 --> 02:27:33,889
thing.

1655
02:27:33,889 --> 02:27:35,889
Oh!

1656
02:27:35,889 --> 02:27:39,389
Hi kids.

1657
02:27:39,389 --> 02:27:43,340
My name's Sean Stevenson.

1658
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:45,340
I'm the actor that plays Super Mario on TV.

1659
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:48,420
But what's not funny and what's not

1660
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:52,299
bia-hoo is drugs and alcohol.

1661
02:27:52,299 --> 02:27:54,299
If anyone ever tries to press you into

1662
02:27:54,299 --> 02:27:56,610
taking drugs, you just give them a no.

1663
02:27:56,610 --> 02:27:59,409
A no!

1664
02:27:59,409 --> 02:28:01,649
And if you get older

1665
02:28:01,649 --> 02:28:03,889
and you decide to drink when you're 21,

1666
02:28:03,889 --> 02:28:05,889
make sure you do it in moderation.

1667
02:28:05,889 --> 02:28:08,319
Be very careful. Honestly.

1668
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:12,340
This fucking hair!

1669
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:24,100
Whatever.

1670
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:26,719
The actor revealed

1671
02:28:26,719 --> 02:28:32,670
that's not Mario's hair.

1672
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:36,700
You look like you just got out of jail.

1673
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:39,069
But honestly though,

1674
02:28:39,069 --> 02:28:43,739
don't do fucking drugs. Don't be an idiot.

1675
02:28:43,739 --> 02:28:54,610
Alright, what's next?

1676
02:28:54,610 --> 02:28:56,610
You're on drugs.

1677
02:28:56,610 --> 02:28:58,610
Marijuana in moderation if you're old enough

1678
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:00,610
and you can be careful with it.

1679
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:02,610
Alcohol if you're old enough, be careful with it.

1680
02:29:02,610 --> 02:29:06,750
Understand? Be careful.

1681
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:09,440
Real PSA. Be careful.

1682
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:20,750
Don't be dumb. Is it really that bad?

1683
02:29:20,750 --> 02:29:22,750
I should probably have, yeah.

1684
02:29:22,750 --> 02:29:30,540
Let me give you a new shirt.

1685
02:29:30,540 --> 02:33:42,000
Alright, costume change, I'll be right back.

1686
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,459
Almost back. One sec.

1687
02:33:45,459 --> 02:33:48,079
Dude, these little things are insane, by the way.

1688
02:33:48,079 --> 02:33:51,540
These things are awesome. This little guy right here.

1689
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:54,100
So this is a microphone.

1690
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:56,100
This is like a little wireless...

1691
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:58,659
I know, I know.

1692
02:33:58,659 --> 02:34:02,299
This is a microphone.

1693
02:34:02,299 --> 02:34:04,299
You just clip it on and it works.

1694
02:34:04,299 --> 02:34:06,299
I actually really like this.

1695
02:34:06,299 --> 02:34:11,489
Hopefully it's been sounding okay.

1696
02:34:11,489 --> 02:34:13,489
Vincent van Gogh, yeah.

1697
02:34:13,489 --> 02:34:17,649
Probably this one.

1698
02:34:17,649 --> 02:34:19,649
Oh, spoilers, yeah.

1699
02:34:19,649 --> 02:34:59,700
Chat, does that sound fine? Does that sound okay?

1700
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:03,389
Did we sound good?

1701
02:35:03,389 --> 02:35:06,909
Yeah? It's okay?

1702
02:35:06,909 --> 02:35:08,909
Yeah, I'm telling you, if these things worked out,

1703
02:35:08,909 --> 02:35:10,909
I'm going to shout this fucking company out.

1704
02:35:10,909 --> 02:35:14,690
I swear to God.

1705
02:35:14,690 --> 02:35:18,379
Not yet though. Not yet.

1706
02:35:18,379 --> 02:35:21,329
Not yet.

1707
02:35:21,329 --> 02:35:23,329
This is a painter routine.

1708
02:35:23,329 --> 02:35:25,329
Comment on what I'm painting on the big screen or whatever.

1709
02:35:25,329 --> 02:35:28,020
Yeah, what was the description?

1710
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:41,309
Okay.

1711
02:35:41,309 --> 02:35:44,899
Take a little bit of this.

1712
02:35:44,899 --> 02:35:52,450
A little bit of this.

1713
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:55,010
Oh, that looks good, don't you think?

1714
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:57,440
How do you say it? Looks very good.

1715
02:35:57,440 --> 02:36:04,290
Looking pretty good.

1716
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:18,049
It's masterpiece.

1717
02:36:18,049 --> 02:36:20,219
No? No?

1718
02:36:20,219 --> 02:36:24,510
It's masterpiece, no?

1719
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:27,629
No?

1720
02:36:27,629 --> 02:36:29,629
What do you know about art? You know nothing about art.

1721
02:36:29,629 --> 02:36:31,629
You don't know anything.

1722
02:36:31,629 --> 02:36:35,409
You know nothing about art.

1723
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:40,290
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1724
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:44,770
Add a little bit of this.

1725
02:36:44,770 --> 02:36:47,579
A little bit of green.

1726
02:36:47,579 --> 02:36:53,459
Extra green.

1727
02:36:53,459 --> 02:36:59,090
Just a little final touch.

1728
02:36:59,090 --> 02:37:01,090
What do you think?

1729
02:37:01,090 --> 02:37:05,950
Let me get a little closer.

1730
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:11,260
Why would I need to get closer?

1731
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:13,260
That was right here.

1732
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:18,180
Alright, now let's do a big one.

1733
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:20,180
Look at what I have for you.

1734
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:22,860
Look at what I've made for you.

1735
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:24,860
Oh, it's beautiful, no?

1736
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:29,459
The colors.

1737
02:37:29,459 --> 02:37:31,629
It looks fantastic.

1738
02:37:31,629 --> 02:37:36,299
One of the best I've ever painted.

1739
02:37:36,299 --> 02:37:38,299
Finishing touches. Add a little bit more red.

1740
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,760
Looks very good.

1741
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,760
Very good.

1742
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:50,690
I don't like this.

1743
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:53,250
I don't like this part.

1744
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:57,090
Right here. Let me change it.

1745
02:37:57,090 --> 02:38:09,360
That's...

1746
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:11,360
Magnificent. Absolutely

1747
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:17,629
Magnificent.

1748
02:38:17,629 --> 02:38:19,629
Last final touch, I swear I will not touch it again.

1749
02:38:19,629 --> 02:38:22,639
Oh, beautiful.

1750
02:38:22,639 --> 02:38:31,280
Beautiful painting.

1751
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:33,280
You don't like my art work?

1752
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:37,120
But you are stupid. Very stupid.

1753
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:40,190
She threw this at your face and you turned your fucking head.

1754
02:38:40,190 --> 02:38:43,260
That is a masterpiece right here.

1755
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:45,819
Fucking dope idiot.

1756
02:38:45,819 --> 02:38:49,979
I got like really into that one.

1757
02:38:49,979 --> 02:38:52,739
I was like into that. That was like fun.

1758
02:38:52,739 --> 02:38:55,299
I was really into that.

1759
02:38:55,299 --> 02:39:01,440
Alright, what else?

1760
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:03,440
Cashier. Should I?

1761
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:06,129
Tired, fast food, miserable one.

1762
02:39:06,129 --> 02:39:08,129
A fast food one?

1763
02:39:08,129 --> 02:39:10,370
Should I still be with a mustache

1764
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:13,180
and a palette?

1765
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:19,899
This doesn't work for this.

1766
02:39:19,899 --> 02:39:21,899
So I'm working at like a store.

1767
02:39:21,899 --> 02:39:34,750
Same mustache?

1768
02:39:34,750 --> 02:39:39,100
So am I

1769
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:44,219
scanning items or what am I doing?

1770
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:51,700
I'm going to be scanning items.

1771
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:56,049
The fucking Saul Goodman shit is going to be in there.

1772
02:39:56,049 --> 02:40:04,350
How are you?

1773
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:08,959
I'm doing great.

1774
02:40:08,959 --> 02:40:15,620
This is all you have? This is it?

1775
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:17,620
Get the cart back there. You're going to have to bring it in.

1776
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:24,260
Right.

1777
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:26,260
Look, I don't care.

1778
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:28,260
I don't care about that.

1779
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:30,260
Call somebody else.

1780
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:32,260
I'm literally just here trying to work.

1781
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:38,399
Why are you telling me this?

1782
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:40,579
Why are you telling me this?

1783
02:40:40,579 --> 02:40:42,579
I don't want to hear this.

1784
02:40:42,579 --> 02:40:44,579
I'm literally just trying to help you.

1785
02:40:44,579 --> 02:40:46,579
I'm trying to help you. I'm just trying to get you out of here.

1786
02:40:46,579 --> 02:40:51,569
Put up with these fucking people.

1787
02:40:51,569 --> 02:40:53,569
I swear to God. Just screaming at me.

1788
02:40:53,569 --> 02:41:00,479
Okay. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

1789
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:03,600
That's it?

1790
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:05,600
That's $49.

1791
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:07,899
Thank you.

1792
02:41:07,899 --> 02:41:15,569
Put your card in.

1793
02:41:15,569 --> 02:41:17,809
It goes the other way.

1794
02:41:17,809 --> 02:41:19,809
It goes the other way. The card reader, it goes the other way.

1795
02:41:19,809 --> 02:41:21,809
You have a chip on it, right?

1796
02:41:21,809 --> 02:41:23,809
The chip goes, chip facing in.

1797
02:41:23,809 --> 02:41:25,809
How many stores

1798
02:41:25,809 --> 02:41:27,809
have you been to in your whole life

1799
02:41:27,809 --> 02:41:29,809
that you don't know the chip goes the other way?

1800
02:41:29,809 --> 02:41:42,659
Fast food, what?

1801
02:41:42,659 --> 02:41:45,340
A fast food?

1802
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:47,340
A barista?

1803
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:50,670
This is like, oh, do checkout items.

1804
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:52,670
Okay.

1805
02:41:52,670 --> 02:41:54,670
I can't work with that.

1806
02:41:54,670 --> 02:41:58,639
All right. Barista. Here we go.

1807
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:00,879
Man, oh, man. Yep.

1808
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:02,879
Hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's up?

1809
02:42:02,879 --> 02:42:06,399
Yep. I knew you were coming.

1810
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:08,399
This is yours. That's your extra

1811
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:10,399
soy latte. Extra whip.

1812
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:12,399
Extra sugar.

1813
02:42:12,399 --> 02:42:14,399
Yeah, man. Just got a new machine. Hold on.

1814
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:18,370
Hold on. Let's do that again.

1815
02:42:18,370 --> 02:42:20,370
Oh, yo. What's up? Hey.

1816
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:22,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I knew you were coming.

1817
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:24,540
I got you ready. That's your extra whip, extra cream, extra sugar,

1818
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:26,540
extra not coffee.

1819
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:28,540
There you go. Take it, man.

1820
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,540
How you been? It's been a hot minute since I've seen you.

1821
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:32,540
Yeah. You want another coffee?

1822
02:42:32,540 --> 02:42:34,850
Do you want one, too?

1823
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:36,850
Hey, let me guess. Extra whip,

1824
02:42:36,850 --> 02:42:38,850
extra cream, extra sugar, no coffee.

1825
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:40,850
Yep. I got you. Don't worry.

1826
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,280
Let's go ahead and put the coffee

1827
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,280
aside over here because we're not going to use it.

1828
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,280
Let's do cream.

1829
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:51,280
Okay. A bunch of sugar.

1830
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:53,280
Okay. Interesting.

1831
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:55,280
Let me go like this

1832
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:57,280
because it keeps folding in on me.

1833
02:42:57,280 --> 02:42:59,280
Hey, let's try that one more time.

1834
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,280
Oh, yeah. I need those, yeah.

1835
02:43:05,170 --> 02:43:09,459
Hey, here we go.

1836
02:43:09,459 --> 02:43:12,659
All right.

1837
02:43:12,659 --> 02:43:14,659
Looks really nice.

1838
02:43:14,659 --> 02:43:16,659
Hey, hey. What's up, man? How are you?

1839
02:43:16,659 --> 02:43:18,959
Yeah, I got a pot brewing for you right here.

1840
02:43:18,959 --> 02:43:22,909
Was it on?

1841
02:43:22,909 --> 02:43:24,909
Yeah, I think this thing is pushing down.

1842
02:43:24,909 --> 02:43:30,340
Is that better? We good?

1843
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:32,829
It keeps, like, folding in on itself.

1844
02:43:32,829 --> 02:43:35,649
Hopefully it sounds all right. Good? Okay.

1845
02:43:35,649 --> 02:43:40,129
Hot coffee. Hot pot.

1846
02:43:40,129 --> 02:43:42,129
Let's brew that coffee. Nice, freshly

1847
02:43:42,129 --> 02:43:44,129
brewed coffee. There it is. Throw it away.

1848
02:43:44,129 --> 02:43:46,430
We don't need that. There we go. This is the cream.

1849
02:43:46,430 --> 02:43:49,120
There we go. There's the sugar.

1850
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:51,120
And there's the milk.

1851
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:53,120
Hey, what's up, bro? How are you doing?

1852
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:55,120
I got a coffee for you brewed right before you got in.

1853
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:57,120
I know your order. Come on.

1854
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,120
I don't know your order or not. There, take it.

1855
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:01,680
Is it good? Give it a try.

1856
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:03,979
That's freshly brewed, by the way.

1857
02:44:03,979 --> 02:44:06,850
Yep. Do you want one, too? You want a coffee?

1858
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:09,280
Hey, let me guess. Cream.

1859
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:12,290
Sugar. It's syrup.

1860
02:44:12,290 --> 02:44:14,290
And no coffee. You got it. Yep.

1861
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:18,059
I got you. Is the weather out there?

1862
02:44:18,059 --> 02:44:20,750
Was it hot? Yeah, it's always hot out there.

1863
02:44:20,750 --> 02:44:23,950
Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1864
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:27,340
Really? No, dude.

1865
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:30,159
Really? Hey, try this, man.

1866
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:32,159
Try this. I call this

1867
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:34,159
Hey, you know what I call this, man? I call this

1868
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:36,340
the shit that's after

1869
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:38,340
you eat the cereal, the milk you drink.

1870
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:40,340
Here you go. Take it, man. Try it. Give it a try.

1871
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:44,159
What do you think? Give me your honest opinion.

1872
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:47,680
I want another real deal. Yeah.

1873
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:50,110
Mm-hmm. Tasty, isn't it?

1874
02:44:50,110 --> 02:44:53,500
Very good. Yeah, it's very good.

1875
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:57,409
Wait, what do you want?

1876
02:44:57,409 --> 02:45:01,700
Do you wish you wanted a black coffee?

1877
02:45:01,700 --> 02:45:05,340
What's that? You want a black coffee?

1878
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:07,840
Fucking weirdo? What?

1879
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:11,420
What did you say? What did you want?

1880
02:45:11,420 --> 02:45:13,420
I don't know if I even have that. Let me see.

1881
02:45:13,420 --> 02:45:17,819
I've got milk. I've got

1882
02:45:17,819 --> 02:45:19,819
a bunch of cream and I have sugar.

1883
02:45:19,819 --> 02:45:23,139
You want coffee?

1884
02:45:23,139 --> 02:45:25,139
All right, I guess that's fucking weird, but

1885
02:45:25,139 --> 02:45:27,309
I'll make it for you. This is on the ground, by the way.

1886
02:45:27,309 --> 02:45:34,590
All right, there you go. Here's your coffee.

1887
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:36,590
Freshly brewed. There it is. Put your cup out.

1888
02:45:36,590 --> 02:45:43,299
There it is.

1889
02:45:43,299 --> 02:45:45,299
Weird that somebody ordered a fucking coffee. Usually people order milk,

1890
02:45:45,299 --> 02:45:47,299
sugar, and cream, and then they mix it up and they

1891
02:45:47,299 --> 02:45:49,299
stir it up and they add like fucking hazelnut syrup to it.

1892
02:45:49,299 --> 02:45:51,729
What's going on here? What the fuck is going on?

1893
02:45:51,729 --> 02:45:53,729
That person's a fucking weird person.

1894
02:45:53,729 --> 02:45:56,799
And I want to get him out of my store now.

1895
02:45:56,799 --> 02:45:58,799
Hey, yo, uh, you gotta leave.

1896
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:00,799
You gotta leave now.

1897
02:46:00,799 --> 02:46:04,000
I'm not into you here. This is fucking

1898
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
big, big, big

1899
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
dicks coffee. I was going to say this is big

1900
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
dicks coffee. You get the fuck out of here.

1901
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:15,379
Do anyone want some coffee?

1902
02:46:15,379 --> 02:46:17,809
Oh, the

1903
02:46:17,809 --> 02:46:22,420
coffee, really?

1904
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:27,790
Hey, coffee.

1905
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:30,100
Coffee. Anyone want some coffee?

1906
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:32,100
Coffee. I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

1907
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:34,270
Hey, coffee.

1908
02:46:34,270 --> 02:46:36,270
Who wants coffee? Hey, who wants coffee?

1909
02:46:36,270 --> 02:46:38,270
I just, I got a fresh pot of coffee

1910
02:46:38,270 --> 02:46:40,770
here. Hey, who wants coffee?

1911
02:46:40,770 --> 02:46:43,069
You want coffee?

1912
02:46:43,069 --> 02:46:46,020
Hey, you want coffee?

1913
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:49,090
Hey, who wants coffee?

1914
02:46:49,090 --> 02:46:51,090
I got coffee. I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

1915
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:53,459
Fresh pot. You want coffee?

1916
02:46:53,459 --> 02:46:55,459
I just got a fresh pot of coffee. You want coffee?

1917
02:46:55,459 --> 02:46:58,639
Coffee. Who wants coffee?

1918
02:46:58,639 --> 02:47:04,020
I'm doing it right, right?

1919
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:07,090
Fast food worker. Oh, God.

1920
02:47:07,090 --> 02:47:09,969
I'm going to say all the fucking fast food workers out there.

1921
02:47:09,969 --> 02:47:14,770
You should be making way more money.

1922
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:18,860
Dad grilling burgers.

1923
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:22,829
Well, I probably wouldn't be wearing this.

1924
02:47:22,829 --> 02:47:29,860
I'll do dad grilling burgers.

1925
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:34,139
It's a beautiful day. Just on grilling duty.

1926
02:47:34,139 --> 02:47:37,600
Be careful over there. Be careful.

1927
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:42,129
Don't be too rough.

1928
02:47:42,129 --> 02:47:44,129
Let him like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day.

1929
02:47:44,129 --> 02:47:48,590
Yeah. Yep.

1930
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:50,770
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1931
02:47:50,770 --> 02:47:55,309
It's a worst job, by the way.

1932
02:47:55,309 --> 02:47:59,069
I don't know. Nobody can hear me, but still.

1933
02:47:59,069 --> 02:48:01,069
Just sit up here all fucking God damn day.

1934
02:48:01,069 --> 02:48:04,459
Fifteen patties here.

1935
02:48:04,459 --> 02:48:07,840
Four of them are going to get eaten.

1936
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,840
Stupid fucking idiots in this family.

1937
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:12,700
Yep, I can see you.

1938
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:14,700
What are you doing?

1939
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:17,649
That's a funny hat.

1940
02:48:17,649 --> 02:48:22,129
That's a funny hat that you have on.

1941
02:48:22,129 --> 02:48:24,129
Yep, you're my boy.

1942
02:48:24,129 --> 02:48:27,389
Yeah, you are.

1943
02:48:27,389 --> 02:48:31,870
The kid's a fucking idiot.

1944
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:45,180
Does anybody want a burger? Burgers are almost done.

1945
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:47,180
I mean, I shouldn't be flipping these as much, but I am.

1946
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:51,090
What do you do up here besides just flip?

1947
02:48:51,090 --> 02:48:53,090
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

1948
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:55,090
You just wait for somebody to come tap you on the shoulder.

1949
02:48:55,090 --> 02:49:00,000
Nobody's fucking around me.

1950
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Oh, hey, dad. Oh, there's the grill master.

1951
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
There he is, the grill master.

1952
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,260
Yeah, yeah, because nobody else wants to fucking do it.

1953
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:11,260
So I do it, and I sit here all day.

1954
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:13,260
You're going to think I want to be back there.

1955
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:16,059
What's that? No.

1956
02:49:16,059 --> 02:49:19,709
You're doing a great job out there, son.

1957
02:49:19,709 --> 02:49:21,709
Don't climb that.

1958
02:49:21,709 --> 02:49:23,709
Don't get down from there.

1959
02:49:23,709 --> 02:49:25,709
Don't climb that. Do you mind?

1960
02:49:25,709 --> 02:49:28,659
Don't climb that.

1961
02:49:28,659 --> 02:49:30,659
He's a maniac, I know, right?

1962
02:49:30,659 --> 02:49:33,659
He's my son, right?

1963
02:49:33,659 --> 02:49:37,120
You ready for a dog?

1964
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:40,000
You don't want a dog.

1965
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:49,649
Does anybody want dogs?

1966
02:49:49,649 --> 02:49:52,270
No one wants a dog.

1967
02:49:52,270 --> 02:49:57,819
What did I put seven on here?

1968
02:49:57,819 --> 02:50:00,379
It's stupid. It's stupid.

1969
02:50:00,379 --> 02:50:05,360
When I take a tally, when I take a tally,

1970
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:07,540
and I say, what do you want?

1971
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:09,540
Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?

1972
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:11,540
And I hear, dog, dog, dog.

1973
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:13,540
I take a fucking dog.

1974
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:16,350
What's that? Yeah.

1975
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:19,739
Yeah, that's awesome.

1976
02:50:19,739 --> 02:50:22,559
You threw them in the pool?

1977
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:25,569
When I say how many fucking hot dogs I'm going to make,

1978
02:50:25,569 --> 02:50:27,569
it's seven, and nobody eats them.

1979
02:50:27,569 --> 02:50:29,569
Nobody eats the seven dogs.

1980
02:50:29,569 --> 02:50:38,000
You know, I'm going to eat one.

1981
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Those are fucking gross. Those are raw.

1982
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,620
That was pretty much raw.

1983
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:46,459
That was a raw hot dog that I just ate.

1984
02:50:46,459 --> 02:50:48,459
I wish somebody else could be.

1985
02:50:48,459 --> 02:50:50,459
We should hire someone to do this next time,

1986
02:50:50,459 --> 02:50:54,979
so I don't have to sit here and do this in three hours.

1987
02:50:54,979 --> 02:50:57,860
What's that? Yeah, you want a burger?

1988
02:50:57,860 --> 02:51:04,500
You do? And you want a dog, too?

1989
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:06,500
Yeah, come on over here.

1990
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:08,500
I got buns, I got ketchup,

1991
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:10,500
I've got mustard, there's relish right here, too.

1992
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:14,719
Please, go for it.

1993
02:51:14,719 --> 02:51:18,430
Whose kid is this?

1994
02:51:18,430 --> 02:51:20,430
He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you.

1995
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:22,430
Little Michael's going to Harvard.

1996
02:51:22,430 --> 02:51:25,760
He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you.

1997
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,020
He's going to Harvard. Thank you.

1998
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:32,799
You like it? It's delicious.

1999
02:51:32,799 --> 02:51:36,899
This is what it's about.

2000
02:51:36,899 --> 02:51:38,899
It's about grilling out here with the family,

2001
02:51:38,899 --> 02:51:40,899
with the friends, and yeah, alright.

2002
02:51:40,899 --> 02:51:43,459
Okay.

2003
02:51:43,459 --> 02:51:45,459
How much longer do I do this for?

2004
02:51:45,459 --> 02:51:52,559
Who's going to use this?

2005
02:51:52,559 --> 02:51:54,559
Who's going to use this?

2006
02:51:54,559 --> 02:51:57,950
No one is going to use it.

2007
02:51:59,950 --> 02:52:02,639
I can't just sit up here

2008
02:52:02,639 --> 02:52:04,639
and just fucking do a

2009
02:52:04,639 --> 02:52:06,639
one-man monologue show.

2010
02:52:06,639 --> 02:52:10,030
Do you remember when I did

2011
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:12,030
the whole saw routine?

2012
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:14,030
I was in the chair.

2013
02:52:14,030 --> 02:52:16,030
I was five, ten minutes

2014
02:52:16,030 --> 02:52:18,030
straight of doing this whole routine.

2015
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:20,030
Out of

2016
02:52:20,030 --> 02:52:22,030
four or five hundred videos,

2017
02:52:22,030 --> 02:52:24,270
I think one person

2018
02:52:24,270 --> 02:52:26,270
used it, and it was for five

2019
02:52:26,270 --> 02:52:28,270
seconds total.

2020
02:52:28,270 --> 02:52:30,270
I'm just doing an acting

2021
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:32,270
study. Who's going to use it

2022
02:52:32,270 --> 02:52:34,700
for anything?

2023
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:36,700
So this is a driving instructor?

2024
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:38,700
Okay.

2025
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:42,030
I need the mustache back on.

2026
02:52:42,030 --> 02:52:44,030
Let me see what it looks like.

2027
02:52:44,030 --> 02:52:46,030
I'm just

2028
02:52:46,030 --> 02:52:48,030
doing it for like ten minutes.

2029
02:52:48,030 --> 02:52:50,030
Nobody stopped me.

2030
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:55,940
Nobody stopped me.

2031
02:52:55,940 --> 02:52:57,940
I looked at Holly. Holly was just

2032
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:59,940
sitting there staring at me like,

2033
02:52:59,940 --> 02:53:01,940
she kind of gave me the, are you still going?

2034
02:53:01,940 --> 02:53:08,459
And I'm like, I guess.

2035
02:53:08,459 --> 02:53:10,770
I don't think so.

2036
02:53:10,770 --> 02:53:14,030
Okay.

2037
02:53:14,030 --> 02:53:19,149
So this is a driving instructor.

2038
02:53:19,149 --> 02:53:23,379
I look like a fucking weirdo.

2039
02:53:23,379 --> 02:53:26,450
Okay. Driving instructor.

2040
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:28,450
Look at the clothes.

2041
02:53:28,450 --> 02:53:31,200
All right.

2042
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,200
So should I be this way?

2043
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:35,200
If I'm sitting down with a clipboard

2044
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:37,500
and I'm writing? I don't know.

2045
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,500
Should I be facing

2046
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:41,500
a few different angles?

2047
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:43,500
Okay.

2048
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:47,979
Let me know if I'm in frame

2049
02:53:47,979 --> 02:53:50,479
when I get over there.

2050
02:53:50,479 --> 02:53:54,180
Okay.

2051
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:58,850
How's this?

2052
02:53:58,850 --> 02:54:00,850
My fly is not down, right?

2053
02:54:00,850 --> 02:54:07,100
I'm not going to get in trouble.

2054
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:09,100
So like from here up?

2055
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:17,889
I'm going to hold it here.

2056
02:54:17,889 --> 02:54:25,180
So I'm going to say, if I'm a passenger,

2057
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:29,600
the driver is over here.

2058
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:32,219
How are we doing? How are we? Good?

2059
02:54:32,219 --> 02:54:34,219
You can begin at any point.

2060
02:54:34,219 --> 02:54:36,219
I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing, by the way.

2061
02:54:36,219 --> 02:54:41,149
You can come out here and take a right.

2062
02:54:41,149 --> 02:54:47,299
Easy on the gas. Easy. Hold it back.

2063
02:54:47,299 --> 02:54:50,620
A little on the gas there.

2064
02:54:50,620 --> 02:54:53,500
You can get on the highway here.

2065
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:57,090
Stop.

2066
02:54:57,090 --> 02:54:59,090
Slow down.

2067
02:54:59,090 --> 02:55:04,399
I'm going to have to take off a few points for that one.

2068
02:55:04,399 --> 02:55:07,090
But you didn't signal.

2069
02:55:07,090 --> 02:55:09,090
You didn't signal when you went right.

2070
02:55:09,090 --> 02:55:11,090
And that's the first thing that we're going to do here.

2071
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:13,090
By the way, if you get four or five points wrong here,

2072
02:55:13,090 --> 02:55:15,090
your license is not going to come through.

2073
02:55:15,090 --> 02:55:18,100
And I am a stickler.

2074
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:20,100
Very much so for these points.

2075
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:24,690
Just keep that in mind.

2076
02:55:24,690 --> 02:55:26,690
You can merge over here if you want.

2077
02:55:26,690 --> 02:55:31,739
Slowly merge.

2078
02:55:31,739 --> 02:55:34,299
Slowly merge.

2079
02:55:34,299 --> 02:55:37,120
Way too fast.

2080
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,120
Actually too fast.

2081
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:42,639
Okay. I don't know what that was.

2082
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:45,329
Just stay in your lane here, please.

2083
02:55:45,329 --> 02:55:50,639
Thank you.

2084
02:55:50,639 --> 02:55:52,940
Very nice.

2085
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:57,739
That was a good one. That was actually a pretty good merge.

2086
02:55:57,739 --> 02:55:59,739
Good. Watch it.

2087
02:55:59,739 --> 02:56:01,739
Keep your eyes on the road here, please.

2088
02:56:01,739 --> 02:56:09,680
Be careful.

2089
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:11,680
Do you mind?

2090
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:13,680
Just go ahead.

2091
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:15,680
This is my car in the glove box over here with me.

2092
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:17,680
See if I can grab these glasses.

2093
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,819
Just keep driving.

2094
02:56:20,819 --> 02:56:22,819
You're fine. You're fine. Keep driving.

2095
02:56:22,819 --> 02:56:26,129
Keep driving. You're all right.

2096
02:56:26,129 --> 02:56:28,129
It's a very big car.

2097
02:56:28,129 --> 02:56:30,129
Yeah, that's why I have it.

2098
02:56:30,129 --> 02:56:37,620
Just make sure I can see what you're up to.

2099
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:39,620
Could you pull this way and park for me, please?

2100
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:42,690
This is the parallel parking part of the exam.

2101
02:56:42,690 --> 02:56:45,059
Over here,

2102
02:56:45,059 --> 02:56:47,059
parallel parking this spot right here.

2103
02:56:47,059 --> 02:56:49,059
There's two spots available. Not the one in front of the red truck.

2104
02:56:49,059 --> 02:56:51,489
The one behind it.

2105
02:56:51,489 --> 02:56:53,489
Behind the red truck.

2106
02:56:53,489 --> 02:56:56,110
Use your eyes.

2107
02:56:56,110 --> 02:56:58,420
Do you want these?

2108
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:02,379
Do you want to put these on?

2109
02:57:02,379 --> 02:57:04,379
I told you I was a stickler and I'm going to be that.

2110
02:57:04,379 --> 02:57:07,010
Right there,

2111
02:57:07,010 --> 02:57:09,010
parallel park behind the red truck.

2112
02:57:09,010 --> 02:57:11,010
I'm not going to say it another time.

2113
02:57:11,010 --> 02:57:15,420
Get up there in parallel park.

2114
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:17,420
You hit it.

2115
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:20,370
You bumped his bumper.

2116
02:57:20,370 --> 02:57:22,370
Get your tire perpendicular to the window.

2117
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:24,370
Tire perpendicular to the window.

2118
02:57:24,370 --> 02:57:26,370
Back up at a 40-degree angle.

2119
02:57:26,370 --> 02:57:28,370
Turn around.

2120
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:30,370
Back up. Drive straight.

2121
02:57:30,370 --> 02:57:32,370
Turn right at 45 degrees. Pull in.

2122
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:34,370
You learned this already.

2123
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:42,430
I am very much unhappy.

2124
02:57:42,430 --> 02:57:44,430
That's going to get you two grades off, I think.

2125
02:57:44,430 --> 02:57:46,799
You're not getting your license today, by the way.

2126
02:57:46,799 --> 02:57:52,239
I think that very clear.

2127
02:57:52,239 --> 02:57:56,079
Very bumpy.

2128
02:57:56,079 --> 02:57:59,709
All right, that's enough.

2129
02:57:59,709 --> 02:58:01,709
What I have here is I have

2130
02:58:01,709 --> 02:58:03,709
two bumped cars.

2131
02:58:03,709 --> 02:58:05,709
Would you like to see the notes?

2132
02:58:05,709 --> 02:58:07,709
You can see it if you want. Would you like to see what I've written down?

2133
02:58:07,709 --> 02:58:09,709
Go ahead and look.

2134
02:58:09,709 --> 02:58:12,510
You bumped a car.

2135
02:58:12,510 --> 02:58:14,510
You went 40, 50 miles per hour

2136
02:58:14,510 --> 02:58:16,510
getting on the on-ramp to the highway.

2137
02:58:16,510 --> 02:58:18,750
And not only that, you don't know how to parallel park.

2138
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,750
And guess what? I don't either.

2139
02:58:20,750 --> 02:58:23,180
But I'm not the one getting this test taken.

2140
02:58:23,180 --> 02:58:26,700
Is there anything that you can pass?

2141
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:30,540
Give me the wheel.

2142
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:32,540
Let me show you how it's done.

2143
02:58:32,540 --> 02:58:34,540
Here, you hold this. Yeah, you grade me.

2144
02:58:34,540 --> 02:58:36,780
You grade me.

2145
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:38,780
You go ahead and grade me.

2146
02:58:38,780 --> 02:58:42,180
Easily let off the gas.

2147
02:58:42,180 --> 02:58:44,420
Put the brake on. Let go of the brake very, very easily.

2148
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:46,590
Easily, easily.

2149
02:58:46,590 --> 02:58:51,579
Thank you.

2150
02:58:51,579 --> 02:58:54,590
Put the gas on. Oh, shit.

2151
02:58:54,590 --> 02:58:57,469
This is how you do it. This is how you drive a goddamn car.

2152
02:58:57,469 --> 02:59:00,610
You can go to sleep if you want.

2153
02:59:00,610 --> 02:59:06,879
I got this.

2154
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:08,879
Very nice. Pull it in.

2155
02:59:08,879 --> 02:59:10,879
Parallel park it. This is how we parallel park.

2156
02:59:10,879 --> 02:59:15,469
Step on the gas.

2157
02:59:15,469 --> 02:59:17,899
Step on the brake.

2158
02:59:17,899 --> 02:59:20,909
Step on the gas again.

2159
02:59:20,909 --> 02:59:23,340
And we're in the spot.

2160
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:25,340
What did you do, coach?

2161
02:59:25,340 --> 02:59:27,340
What did you put down for me? Did you give me an A?

2162
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:33,680
Get out of the car.

2163
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:35,680
Okay, so now I have to be going

2164
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:37,680
this way?

2165
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:44,450
Okay.

2166
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:47,780
Am I on the right side here?

2167
02:59:47,780 --> 02:59:53,729
That pencil.

2168
02:59:53,729 --> 03:00:01,090
The doctor of God.

2169
03:00:01,090 --> 03:00:05,120
So this is for you guys to do

2170
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:07,120
cuts if you want to do cuts.

2171
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:17,409
I'm sure about that.

2172
03:00:17,409 --> 03:00:23,860
Okay.

2173
03:00:23,860 --> 03:00:25,860
What you need to do is you need to relax.

2174
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:27,860
Put your gist up on that gas.

2175
03:00:31,819 --> 03:00:34,510
You screwed that up.

2176
03:00:34,510 --> 03:00:36,510
What you needed to do there is you had to...

2177
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:38,510
Not happy about it.

2178
03:00:38,510 --> 03:00:43,180
Very much unhappy about that.

2179
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:48,239
You're pretty dumb.

2180
03:00:48,239 --> 03:00:50,239
Can I just tell you? You're dumb.

2181
03:00:50,239 --> 03:00:53,059
No human drives a car like this.

2182
03:00:53,059 --> 03:00:55,059
No human.

2183
03:00:55,059 --> 03:00:57,059
You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably do better than the test than you did.

2184
03:00:57,059 --> 03:00:59,059
In fact, you'd get an armadillo

2185
03:00:59,059 --> 03:01:01,059
to do this test and probably do better than you just did.

2186
03:01:01,059 --> 03:01:03,059
You'd get an ant.

2187
03:01:03,059 --> 03:01:05,059
You'd get me an army of ants

2188
03:01:05,059 --> 03:01:07,059
and get them up to the wheel.

2189
03:01:07,059 --> 03:01:09,059
Four or five thousand ants.

2190
03:01:09,059 --> 03:01:11,059
And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.

2191
03:01:11,059 --> 03:01:14,129
Keep going.

2192
03:01:14,129 --> 03:01:17,840
You don't think I could do that?

2193
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:19,840
You don't think I could train ants to do that?

2194
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:21,840
You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants?

2195
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:27,340
They'd be running circles around you, by the way.

2196
03:01:27,340 --> 03:01:31,170
Oh, what a terrible...

2197
03:01:31,170 --> 03:01:33,170
Stop sign. Stop sign.

2198
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:35,170
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

2199
03:01:35,170 --> 03:01:37,170
Stop sign. Stop sign.

2200
03:01:37,170 --> 03:01:39,170
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

2201
03:01:39,170 --> 03:01:41,170
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

2202
03:01:41,170 --> 03:01:45,649
Do you see what's in front of us?

2203
03:01:45,649 --> 03:01:47,889
You do, right? What's in front of us?

2204
03:01:47,889 --> 03:01:49,889
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

2205
03:01:49,889 --> 03:01:53,280
Stop sign.

2206
03:01:53,280 --> 03:02:00,129
Keep going.

2207
03:02:00,129 --> 03:02:05,739
I think the microphone's fucked up.

2208
03:02:05,739 --> 03:02:08,049
There we go.

2209
03:02:08,049 --> 03:02:11,819
Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull in that McDonald's.

2210
03:02:11,819 --> 03:02:13,819
Very important part of your test.

2211
03:02:13,819 --> 03:02:17,090
Driving through a drive-through is actually very hard.

2212
03:02:17,090 --> 03:02:19,090
It's a very narrow road.

2213
03:02:19,090 --> 03:02:21,090
It's a very narrow part of...

2214
03:02:21,090 --> 03:02:25,629
It's hard to kind of navigate in there.

2215
03:02:25,629 --> 03:02:28,319
Pull in smoothly. Smooth it out.

2216
03:02:28,319 --> 03:02:31,500
Stop.

2217
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:35,409
Roll your window down. Get out of the way.

2218
03:02:35,409 --> 03:02:39,059
Yeah, I'll take

2219
03:02:39,059 --> 03:02:42,319
two double cheeseburgers.

2220
03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:45,260
Three McChickens.

2221
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:50,110
Yep.

2222
03:02:50,110 --> 03:02:52,610
Two double cheeseburgers.

2223
03:02:52,610 --> 03:02:55,229
Three McChickens. Yep.

2224
03:02:55,229 --> 03:02:58,049
Can I have no sauce on the McChickens?

2225
03:02:58,049 --> 03:03:01,700
No sauce, please.

2226
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:03,700
They don't...

2227
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:05,700
You can't do that here?

2228
03:03:05,700 --> 03:03:07,700
I'm working that down on your exam.

2229
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:10,700
Took me to a McDonald's without any fucking sauce.

2230
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:12,700
You can't take it off?

2231
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:14,700
No, that's okay. That's all right.

2232
03:03:14,700 --> 03:03:16,700
Can you...

2233
03:03:16,700 --> 03:03:21,760
Do you want anything?

2234
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:23,760
And a small drink. A small...

2235
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:26,190
One small Coke, please.

2236
03:03:26,190 --> 03:03:29,260
And that's it.

2237
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:31,260
By the way, they rented my sauce.

2238
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:33,260
They rented my szechuan sauce.

2239
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:39,149
That's all going on your record here.

2240
03:03:39,149 --> 03:03:44,590
Yeah, pull around. Thank you.

2241
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:46,959
Hey, howdy. How are you?

2242
03:03:46,959 --> 03:03:49,760
Yep, I'll take it. Can you put it over here?

2243
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:51,760
I'm just doing a fucking acting class.

2244
03:03:55,020 --> 03:04:01,680
Every character

2245
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:03,680
is mean.

2246
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:07,969
Every character is mean.

2247
03:04:07,969 --> 03:04:14,030
Farming minus

2248
03:04:14,030 --> 03:04:16,030
twos.

2249
03:04:16,030 --> 03:04:19,620
What are you talking about?

2250
03:04:19,620 --> 03:04:21,620
I gotta end this one. I gotta end this bit.

2251
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:26,459
So I'm gonna get out of the car.

2252
03:04:26,459 --> 03:04:29,149
All right, that's good.

2253
03:04:29,149 --> 03:04:31,149
Not a bad showing.

2254
03:04:31,149 --> 03:04:36,020
Let me get out of the car and take a look at the car.

2255
03:04:36,020 --> 03:04:38,700
Okay, let me see the car.

2256
03:04:38,700 --> 03:04:42,799
Turn around. Turn the car around.

2257
03:04:42,799 --> 03:04:47,520
Back it up. Good job.

2258
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:49,819
Good job. Pull it back here.

2259
03:04:49,819 --> 03:04:52,059
Right here. Right in front of me.

2260
03:04:52,059 --> 03:04:54,500
Right there. Keep going.

2261
03:04:54,500 --> 03:04:57,059
Stop. Nice stop.

2262
03:04:57,059 --> 03:05:00,690
Nice, commanded stop.

2263
03:05:00,690 --> 03:05:03,700
Okay.

2264
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:06,059
Well, you got an F.

2265
03:05:06,059 --> 03:05:08,620
And you're not gonna be getting your license.

2266
03:05:08,620 --> 03:05:11,250
But if you want to share some McDonald's,

2267
03:05:11,250 --> 03:05:13,420
I'm your guy. So we go ahead and do that.

2268
03:05:13,420 --> 03:05:16,110
End the scene. No one's gonna use that part.

2269
03:05:16,110 --> 03:05:25,010
Okay, what's next?

2270
03:05:25,010 --> 03:05:27,010
I can't

2271
03:05:27,010 --> 03:05:29,010
get hit by the car.

2272
03:05:29,010 --> 03:05:31,010
God damn it, I keep going this way.

2273
03:05:31,010 --> 03:05:33,010
Why do I keep going

2274
03:05:33,010 --> 03:05:35,500
that way? I just

2275
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:37,500
keep going the way I can't go.

2276
03:05:37,500 --> 03:05:46,059
Hold on. Let me move this.

2277
03:05:46,059 --> 03:05:50,860
Okay, that's fine.

2278
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:52,860
Playing musical chairs by yourself.

2279
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:54,860
Playing musical chairs by yourself.

2280
03:05:54,860 --> 03:05:58,049
This one's fine.

2281
03:05:58,049 --> 03:06:01,700
That's a very quick one.

2282
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:03,700
Should I put the mustache back on?

2283
03:06:03,700 --> 03:06:08,879
You know

2284
03:06:08,879 --> 03:06:10,879
what it is? It's when I put a mustache on,

2285
03:06:10,879 --> 03:06:12,879
I'm like a mean guy.

2286
03:06:12,879 --> 03:06:15,180
I think this is the excuse to be

2287
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:17,180
kind of like a dick to everybody.

2288
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:19,420
I don't know why.

2289
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:45,469
Musical chairs with one person.

2290
03:06:45,469 --> 03:06:54,879
I got it. I got it.

2291
03:06:54,879 --> 03:06:56,879
I got it. I got it.

2292
03:06:56,879 --> 03:06:59,250
I got it.

2293
03:06:59,250 --> 03:07:03,010
I got it. Thank you.

2294
03:07:03,010 --> 03:07:09,469
Alright, there was musical chairs

2295
03:07:09,469 --> 03:07:12,420
with no one. Doctor?

2296
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:14,659
Am I in the same office?

2297
03:07:14,659 --> 03:07:16,659
Hey.

2298
03:07:16,659 --> 03:07:18,659
Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something.

2299
03:07:18,659 --> 03:07:20,659
Fuck face. I got a mustache on. I'm pissed.

2300
03:07:20,659 --> 03:07:25,899
This is a weird ASMR

2301
03:07:25,899 --> 03:07:34,610
video. This is an

2302
03:07:34,610 --> 03:07:38,379
ASMR video.

2303
03:07:38,379 --> 03:07:43,309
Okay, this is actually...

2304
03:07:43,309 --> 03:07:49,649
Those latex

2305
03:07:49,649 --> 03:07:52,399
gloves are terrifying.

2306
03:07:52,399 --> 03:07:54,399
I mean, give them to me. Why not? I guess.

2307
03:07:56,579 --> 03:07:58,579
Why would a doctor walk in

2308
03:07:58,579 --> 03:08:00,879
like this?

2309
03:08:00,879 --> 03:08:02,879
Okay, let's go ahead and start your checkup.

2310
03:08:02,879 --> 03:08:04,879
Like every other ASMR

2311
03:08:04,879 --> 03:08:06,879
video. How do you feel? How are you doing?

2312
03:08:06,879 --> 03:08:09,059
Oh my god.

2313
03:08:09,059 --> 03:08:17,889
Hello, patient.

2314
03:08:17,889 --> 03:08:20,579
This is an ASMR. I can't do this.

2315
03:08:20,579 --> 03:08:26,719
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

2316
03:08:26,719 --> 03:08:29,020
How are you?

2317
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:32,850
How are you feeling?

2318
03:08:32,850 --> 03:08:34,850
So it says here you have a little bit of a tummy ache.

2319
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:37,469
Yeah. When did it start?

2320
03:08:37,469 --> 03:08:42,139
Last weekend. Okay.

2321
03:08:42,139 --> 03:08:44,510
Any bloating? Any gas?

2322
03:08:44,510 --> 03:08:46,510
Any flatulence that I

2323
03:08:46,510 --> 03:08:51,549
need to know? Okay.

2324
03:08:51,549 --> 03:08:53,549
How often are you

2325
03:08:53,549 --> 03:08:55,549
using the bathroom?

2326
03:08:55,549 --> 03:09:04,579
Me, me, me, me.

2327
03:09:04,579 --> 03:09:07,069
I fucking can't do this one.

2328
03:09:07,069 --> 03:09:09,069
I can't do this one. This one's too

2329
03:09:09,069 --> 03:09:11,069
weird. I can't do it.

2330
03:09:11,069 --> 03:09:13,069
This one's

2331
03:09:13,069 --> 03:09:15,629
fucked up.

2332
03:09:15,629 --> 03:09:17,809
I'll at least do this.

2333
03:09:17,809 --> 03:09:20,430
Ow! That hurts so

2334
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:23,950
bad. Oh my

2335
03:09:23,950 --> 03:09:25,950
brain. Ow, my brain.

2336
03:09:25,950 --> 03:09:27,950
Okay, take

2337
03:09:27,950 --> 03:09:29,950
this. This is a real stethoscope.

2338
03:09:29,950 --> 03:09:31,950
Ow, my fucking head.

2339
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:36,350
Okay.

2340
03:09:36,350 --> 03:09:41,219
Let me check and see how you're doing.

2341
03:09:41,219 --> 03:09:43,219
Very, very healthy sounding.

2342
03:09:43,219 --> 03:09:46,850
Very healthy.

2343
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:48,850
Can you follow my

2344
03:09:48,850 --> 03:09:52,500
pen, please?

2345
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:54,500
Very good, very good. Excellent, excellent.

2346
03:09:54,500 --> 03:10:01,790
Can you

2347
03:10:01,790 --> 03:10:03,790
stick both my fingers up your nose?

2348
03:10:03,790 --> 03:10:07,950
You said you had a runny nose?

2349
03:10:07,950 --> 03:10:14,610
I think you might have the cold.

2350
03:10:14,610 --> 03:10:18,639
Anything else bothering you today?

2351
03:10:18,639 --> 03:10:24,829
Okay.

2352
03:10:24,829 --> 03:10:30,780
A little fast.

2353
03:10:30,780 --> 03:10:33,149
Well, it's not the common cold.

2354
03:10:33,149 --> 03:10:35,149
I unfortunately have to diagnose you with

2355
03:10:35,149 --> 03:10:37,389
cringe. That's what you're suffering

2356
03:10:37,389 --> 03:10:44,370
from. Get a prescription for

2357
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:47,500
it. The prescription is

2358
03:10:47,500 --> 03:10:49,500
at least four to six hours

2359
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:51,500
of call of duty

2360
03:10:51,500 --> 03:10:53,739
every day. Make sure that

2361
03:10:53,739 --> 03:10:55,739
you're not as cringy as you are.

2362
03:10:55,739 --> 03:10:58,370
Take some of that cringe off.

2363
03:10:58,370 --> 03:11:00,370
And by the way, that is for Xbox 360.

2364
03:11:00,370 --> 03:11:05,360
No other console.

2365
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:08,559
Not on PlayStation.

2366
03:11:08,559 --> 03:11:10,559
You can just take this whole thing.

2367
03:11:10,559 --> 03:11:12,559
Go ahead. Take the whole thing.

2368
03:11:12,559 --> 03:11:18,129
Ow, my fucking ears.

2369
03:11:18,129 --> 03:11:22,020
Somebody said what?

2370
03:11:22,020 --> 03:11:24,020
That I'm a slut?

2371
03:11:24,020 --> 03:11:26,020
Wait, I didn't hear you.

2372
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:29,790
Somebody called you

2373
03:11:29,790 --> 03:11:31,790
a slut.

2374
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:38,700
What?

2375
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:40,700
All right, who's next? What's next?

2376
03:11:40,700 --> 03:11:42,700
Sleazy selling what?

2377
03:11:42,700 --> 03:11:45,709
There's that over there, too,

2378
03:11:45,709 --> 03:11:58,620
if you want to wear it.

2379
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:00,620
It's kind of funny, actually, if somebody

2380
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:03,059
used the doctor's stuff for

2381
03:12:03,059 --> 03:12:05,059
he's listening to his own penis.

2382
03:12:05,059 --> 03:12:07,059
Wait, like, is that

2383
03:12:07,059 --> 03:12:09,059
because

2384
03:12:09,059 --> 03:12:11,229
I feel like

2385
03:12:11,229 --> 03:12:13,229
there's going to be some combinations.

2386
03:12:13,229 --> 03:12:15,229
The best part about doing this stuff is

2387
03:12:15,229 --> 03:12:17,229
people are going, you know, people are saying,

2388
03:12:17,229 --> 03:12:19,229
dude, what the hell are we going to use this for, right?

2389
03:12:19,229 --> 03:12:21,229
But the creativity of the community

2390
03:12:21,229 --> 03:12:23,229
is just, it blows me away.

2391
03:12:23,229 --> 03:12:25,229
Because last time we said the same shit

2392
03:12:25,229 --> 03:12:27,229
and you guys combined

2393
03:12:27,229 --> 03:12:29,229
a bunch of things and made it into

2394
03:12:29,229 --> 03:12:31,229
the same video.

2395
03:12:31,229 --> 03:12:33,229
So I'm very excited to see what the hell you guys

2396
03:12:33,229 --> 03:12:35,229
can come up with, especially with the weird shit

2397
03:12:35,229 --> 03:12:40,540
that's happening today.

2398
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:42,540
Okay.

2399
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:44,540
All right, so walking around with a briefcase.

2400
03:12:44,540 --> 03:12:48,129
I think this is a fine outfit.

2401
03:12:48,129 --> 03:12:54,850
Oh, smash it.

2402
03:12:54,850 --> 03:13:09,760
Yeah.

2403
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:12,260
Hold on, let me get rid of this chair.

2404
03:13:24,209 --> 03:13:26,209
There's a whole Spiderman costume

2405
03:13:26,209 --> 03:13:29,069
here now. All right.

2406
03:13:29,069 --> 03:13:31,500
We're doing sleazy like

2407
03:13:31,500 --> 03:13:42,579
stockbroker. Yeah.

2408
03:13:42,579 --> 03:13:44,579
No, no, no, no, no. I ain't going to be

2409
03:13:44,579 --> 03:13:46,750
doing that. You're going to sell that one.

2410
03:13:46,750 --> 03:13:49,309
Sell it. Yeah.

2411
03:13:49,309 --> 03:13:51,309
Who is going to buy that? Are you serious?

2412
03:13:51,309 --> 03:13:54,700
No, that company's going

2413
03:13:54,700 --> 03:13:56,700
under. There's no way they're going to have, no.

2414
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,700
Their earnings are probably terrible. Sell it.

2415
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:03,309
No, I think, honestly,

2416
03:14:03,309 --> 03:14:05,309
look, I'm going to work. I'm

2417
03:14:05,309 --> 03:14:07,309
on the way to work right now.

2418
03:14:07,309 --> 03:14:10,379
We can talk this later.

2419
03:14:10,379 --> 03:14:13,069
But I want you to buy

2420
03:14:13,069 --> 03:14:15,069
any company that makes,

2421
03:14:15,069 --> 03:14:17,569
makes, what the hell

2422
03:14:17,569 --> 03:14:19,569
are they called? I don't know. The kids, I'll

2423
03:14:19,569 --> 03:14:21,569
watch it. TikTok. Can you buy

2424
03:14:21,569 --> 03:14:24,579
TikTok? How do you buy that?

2425
03:14:24,579 --> 03:14:28,739
My son's into it. Big time. Yeah.

2426
03:14:28,739 --> 03:14:30,739
I mean, I think, I don't know how to buy it.

2427
03:14:30,739 --> 03:14:32,739
Is it possible? Not really?

2428
03:14:32,739 --> 03:14:36,899
All right.

2429
03:14:36,899 --> 03:14:38,899
Find me a company that is just

2430
03:14:38,899 --> 03:14:40,899
like TikTok then and buy that one then.

2431
03:14:40,899 --> 03:14:45,040
Go fuck yourself.

2432
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:48,750
Why would somebody do that?

2433
03:14:48,750 --> 03:14:50,750
Wait, hold on.

2434
03:14:50,750 --> 03:14:52,750
There's a message. Hold on. Wait.

2435
03:14:52,750 --> 03:14:54,750
There's a special message from Mr.

2436
03:14:54,750 --> 03:14:57,059
Giraffe. I've got

2437
03:14:57,059 --> 03:15:02,219
to answer it. Hello?

2438
03:15:02,219 --> 03:15:04,219
Mr. Giraffe. Oh my goodness.

2439
03:15:04,219 --> 03:15:06,719
I'm so glad to hear from you. Did you

2440
03:15:06,719 --> 03:15:09,020
find that company? Yeah. Yeah. No, no.

2441
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:11,020
I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.

2442
03:15:11,020 --> 03:15:13,020
I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.

2443
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:15,389
No, of course not.

2444
03:15:15,389 --> 03:15:17,389
Mr. Giraffe, I don't want

2445
03:15:17,389 --> 03:15:19,389
to buy Google stock.

2446
03:15:19,389 --> 03:15:21,389
I want to buy the TikTok company.

2447
03:15:21,389 --> 03:15:24,850
Okay.

2448
03:15:24,850 --> 03:15:26,850
All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine.

2449
03:15:26,850 --> 03:15:28,850
This is way too big for a briefcase.

2450
03:15:28,850 --> 03:15:30,850
This is a fucking

2451
03:15:30,850 --> 03:15:32,850
huge briefcase.

2452
03:15:32,850 --> 03:15:34,850
Who would have this?

2453
03:15:34,850 --> 03:15:36,850
This is fucking ridiculous.

2454
03:15:38,850 --> 03:15:40,850
Look at how huge this is.

2455
03:15:40,850 --> 03:15:42,850
What is even in this?

2456
03:15:45,340 --> 03:15:47,340
What is in this thing?

2457
03:15:49,340 --> 03:16:00,030
Well, I got mad. There it is.

2458
03:16:00,030 --> 03:16:02,030
All right. Let's do the mime stuff.

2459
03:16:02,030 --> 03:16:04,590
All right. We're going to do another costume change.

2460
03:16:04,590 --> 03:16:07,280
Do Saul Goodman?

2461
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:10,100
I don't even know what to do.

2462
03:16:10,100 --> 03:16:12,100
What do you mean Saul Goodman?

2463
03:16:12,100 --> 03:16:15,469
He's Cinnabon.

2464
03:16:15,469 --> 03:16:22,319
Didn't I already do that?

2465
03:16:22,319 --> 03:16:25,899
Saul Goodman.

2466
03:16:25,899 --> 03:16:29,090
What's the line?

2467
03:16:29,090 --> 03:16:31,090
Guys, I haven't seen past season two

2468
03:16:31,090 --> 03:16:33,329
of Saul Goodman.

2469
03:16:33,329 --> 03:16:43,500
Just say Saul Goodman.

2470
03:16:43,500 --> 03:16:47,729
What is it?

2471
03:16:47,729 --> 03:16:50,219
In the...I'm in a Cinnabon

2472
03:16:50,219 --> 03:16:52,850
outfit.

2473
03:16:52,850 --> 03:16:54,850
I haven't seen past season two of Saul Goodman.

2474
03:16:54,850 --> 03:17:00,079
I don't know.

2475
03:17:00,079 --> 03:17:02,079
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

2476
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:04,079
And do you know that you have rights?

2477
03:17:04,079 --> 03:17:06,450
Call me.

2478
03:17:06,450 --> 03:17:11,040
What is it again?

2479
03:17:11,040 --> 03:17:15,010
Oh, yeah. What is it?

2480
03:17:15,010 --> 03:17:17,010
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Do you know that you have

2481
03:17:17,010 --> 03:17:19,010
rights? The Constitution says you do.

2482
03:17:19,010 --> 03:17:21,010
And so do I. I've lived until proven guilty.

2483
03:17:21,010 --> 03:17:23,010
Every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.

2484
03:17:23,010 --> 03:17:25,010
And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque.

2485
03:17:25,010 --> 03:17:27,010
You better call Saul. Saul Goodman.

2486
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:29,500
This is like a long thing.

2487
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:36,290
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

2488
03:17:36,290 --> 03:17:38,290
And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman.

2489
03:17:38,290 --> 03:17:40,290
Did you know that you have rights?

2490
03:17:40,290 --> 03:17:42,290
And so do I, Albuquerque.

2491
03:17:42,290 --> 03:17:44,290
I'm here to fight for you

2492
03:17:44,290 --> 03:17:46,290
and to fight for your rights and fight for you

2493
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:48,290
in a court of law. Give me a call.

2494
03:17:48,290 --> 03:17:50,290
Better call Saul.

2495
03:17:50,290 --> 03:17:53,100
Better call Saul Goodman.

2496
03:17:53,100 --> 03:17:55,100
Close enough. Print it. I'm not doing another take.

2497
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:57,100
I'm an actor. And I'm a good one.

2498
03:17:57,100 --> 03:17:59,100
A good actor can take a script

2499
03:17:59,100 --> 03:18:01,100
and can change it and make it sound better

2500
03:18:01,100 --> 03:18:03,100
in front of the camera.

2501
03:18:03,100 --> 03:18:05,659
I'm an actor. Are you an actor?

2502
03:18:05,659 --> 03:18:09,299
Can you do this?

2503
03:18:09,299 --> 03:18:11,299
No, you can't. You can't do that.

2504
03:18:11,299 --> 03:18:13,729
Prove it to me if you could.

2505
03:18:13,729 --> 03:18:17,120
I'm an actor. Can you do this?

2506
03:18:17,120 --> 03:18:24,979
I'm an actor.

2507
03:18:24,979 --> 03:18:44,940
I act for a living.

2508
03:18:44,940 --> 03:18:46,940
You're embarrassing yourself.

2509
03:18:46,940 --> 03:18:53,010
Welcome to the last 12 years of my life.

2510
03:18:53,010 --> 03:18:55,500
Alright, what's next? Chef?

2511
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:57,500
I feel like dad grilling burgers and chef

2512
03:18:57,500 --> 03:18:59,500
are going to be pretty similar.

2513
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:18,819
Alright, how's that?

2514
03:19:18,819 --> 03:19:21,059
I need like a thing to

2515
03:19:21,059 --> 03:19:23,059
sit this on, like a table or something, right?

2516
03:19:23,059 --> 03:19:25,360
Or would I just be holding it in the air?

2517
03:19:25,360 --> 03:19:27,360
We could move one of those over.

2518
03:19:27,360 --> 03:19:29,659
What do you think? That could be like a

2519
03:19:29,659 --> 03:19:31,659
burner. I wonder if you could

2520
03:19:31,659 --> 03:19:41,069
clip that out.

2521
03:19:41,069 --> 03:19:58,909
Should I be back a little more?

2522
03:19:58,909 --> 03:20:13,940
I need two chops.

2523
03:20:13,940 --> 03:20:22,770
I need two chops. Two chops.

2524
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:25,139
I need a little more.

2525
03:20:25,139 --> 03:20:27,139
Pass me the salt please.

2526
03:20:27,139 --> 03:20:36,450
Thank you.

2527
03:20:36,450 --> 03:20:40,100
Two chops coming up. Two chops.

2528
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:42,530
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

2529
03:20:42,530 --> 03:20:47,620
Behind. Behind.

2530
03:20:47,620 --> 03:20:55,100
Behind. Behind.

2531
03:20:55,100 --> 03:20:58,610
Yes, chef. Yep.

2532
03:20:58,610 --> 03:21:01,489
I'm looking for the pork chop. Yep.

2533
03:21:01,489 --> 03:21:03,729
Behind. Behind.

2534
03:21:03,729 --> 03:21:09,420
Can I use your burner?

2535
03:21:09,420 --> 03:21:11,920
Can I use your burner?

2536
03:21:11,920 --> 03:21:14,739
I need to use your burner. I need to use your burner.

2537
03:21:14,739 --> 03:21:22,100
Thank you. No, it's not there. It's not there.

2538
03:21:22,100 --> 03:21:30,989
You didn't say behind.

2539
03:21:30,989 --> 03:21:32,989
Say it when you go buy somebody.

2540
03:21:32,989 --> 03:21:35,299
You just bumped me. I don't even know how much I put in.

2541
03:21:41,379 --> 03:21:59,280
All right. How much time? Very good. Very good.

2542
03:21:59,280 --> 03:22:01,280
So far so good. Yes, chef.

2543
03:22:01,280 --> 03:22:03,899
Yeah, I'm currently trying to make

2544
03:22:03,899 --> 03:22:05,899
sure that I have enough of the

2545
03:22:05,899 --> 03:22:07,899
seasoning on here. I'm also trying to make

2546
03:22:07,899 --> 03:22:10,079
sure that I have two. I'm looking for the

2547
03:22:10,079 --> 03:22:15,260
wontons. Where are the wontons?

2548
03:22:15,260 --> 03:22:17,889
Where are the wontons?

2549
03:22:17,889 --> 03:22:21,469
Chef, where are the

2550
03:22:21,469 --> 03:22:23,469
wontons? You closed the fridge

2551
03:22:23,469 --> 03:22:25,469
at the beginning of the tournament. Where are the

2552
03:22:25,469 --> 03:22:27,469
wontons? I need them for my wonton soup

2553
03:22:27,469 --> 03:22:29,469
thing that I'm doing. Where are the

2554
03:22:29,469 --> 03:22:35,489
wontons? Can I have? Okay.

2555
03:22:35,489 --> 03:22:40,479
You got kicked out of chef school.

2556
03:22:40,479 --> 03:22:43,680
I didn't. They got kicked out of chef school.

2557
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:46,370
I didn't. Fuck them.

2558
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:49,180
I know I can't say swears on TV. I know. I'm sorry.

2559
03:22:49,180 --> 03:22:51,180
I can't. I know I'm not supposed to say swears.

2560
03:22:51,180 --> 03:23:08,270
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I got it. I got it.

2561
03:23:08,270 --> 03:23:14,739
I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah.

2562
03:23:14,739 --> 03:23:16,739
My risotto is going to be in the oven in just about

2563
03:23:16,739 --> 03:23:19,680
five minutes, chef.

2564
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:21,680
I've got a creamy cheddar risotto and I

2565
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:23,680
also have a creamy broccoli risotto

2566
03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:25,680
and I also have a creamy mushroom

2567
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:27,979
risotto. And then

2568
03:23:27,979 --> 03:23:35,149
pork chops. Yes. I only

2569
03:23:35,149 --> 03:23:37,149
know how to make risotto besides that. I don't know.

2570
03:23:37,149 --> 03:23:41,680
This is done. All right.

2571
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:45,709
Come on. Come on. Come on. Time.

2572
03:23:45,709 --> 03:24:03,870
Okay. Yep. Hi chefs.

2573
03:24:03,870 --> 03:24:05,870
What I made for you today is I have

2574
03:24:05,870 --> 03:24:07,870
a creamy mushroom risotto

2575
03:24:07,870 --> 03:24:09,870
and a side of creamy broccoli risotto

2576
03:24:09,870 --> 03:24:11,870
with a hint, a small

2577
03:24:11,870 --> 03:24:13,870
portion of a creamy chicken

2578
03:24:13,870 --> 03:24:15,870
risotto. And then on the side

2579
03:24:15,870 --> 03:24:17,870
of that I also have two pork chops

2580
03:24:17,870 --> 03:24:19,870
that I have created and I seared to perfection

2581
03:24:19,870 --> 03:24:21,870
and then finished off in the oven.

2582
03:24:21,870 --> 03:24:31,459
Yes, chef.

2583
03:24:31,459 --> 03:24:37,540
Yeah. Well, I mean,

2584
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:40,159
ever since I was on my own, I

2585
03:24:40,159 --> 03:24:42,909
you know, started to cook

2586
03:24:42,909 --> 03:24:44,909
for myself ever since I was on my own.

2587
03:24:44,909 --> 03:24:50,799
And I learned how to make

2588
03:24:50,799 --> 03:24:52,799
mushroom risotto and yeah.

2589
03:24:52,799 --> 03:24:58,750
And that's what my mom

2590
03:24:58,750 --> 03:25:01,309
taught me, you know.

2591
03:25:01,309 --> 03:25:03,309
I call her every Sunday.

2592
03:25:03,309 --> 03:25:07,780
Yes, chef. Yes,

2593
03:25:07,780 --> 03:25:18,079
chef. Yeah. I understand.

2594
03:25:18,079 --> 03:25:23,069
It's not good.

2595
03:25:23,069 --> 03:25:25,950
What do you mean it's not good?

2596
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:27,950
It's a perfect risotto.

2597
03:25:27,950 --> 03:25:30,899
It's perfect.

2598
03:25:30,899 --> 03:25:36,209
It's a perfect risotto.

2599
03:25:36,209 --> 03:25:38,209
You like to talk like you know food, but you actually

2600
03:25:38,209 --> 03:25:40,209
really don't. You're just a mean

2601
03:25:40,209 --> 03:25:42,209
guy that got a bunch of TV shows.

2602
03:25:42,209 --> 03:25:44,209
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch

2603
03:25:44,209 --> 03:25:46,209
of TV shows and I'm not

2604
03:25:46,209 --> 03:25:48,209
going to stand for it. I'm not leaving.

2605
03:25:48,209 --> 03:25:50,209
No, I think I deserve to win.

2606
03:25:50,209 --> 03:26:04,799
It was a creamy mushroom risotto and you

2607
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:06,799
don't have a fucking palate to save your

2608
03:26:06,799 --> 03:26:08,799
life, you fucking idiot.

2609
03:26:18,690 --> 03:26:20,690
It's so good.

2610
03:26:20,690 --> 03:26:22,690
It's so good. Whatever.

2611
03:26:22,690 --> 03:26:24,690
I don't care.

2612
03:26:24,690 --> 03:26:41,969
What do we do with this?

2613
03:26:41,969 --> 03:26:45,549
Okay.

2614
03:26:45,549 --> 03:26:47,549
One of me winning. Okay.

2615
03:26:47,549 --> 03:26:53,700
Yes, chef.

2616
03:26:53,700 --> 03:26:58,559
What I have for you there is I have two seared pork chops

2617
03:26:58,559 --> 03:27:00,559
with a side of creamy cranberry sauce.

2618
03:27:00,559 --> 03:27:02,559
And I know that you're

2619
03:27:02,559 --> 03:27:04,559
a big fan of chocolate, so

2620
03:27:04,559 --> 03:27:06,559
I added some chocolate flakes on top.

2621
03:27:06,559 --> 03:27:23,100
Yes.

2622
03:27:23,100 --> 03:27:25,100
I had a limited amount of time, so

2623
03:27:25,100 --> 03:27:27,100
I want to make sure that I got the pork chops out

2624
03:27:27,100 --> 03:27:29,100
when the shavings went on to the risotto.

2625
03:27:29,100 --> 03:27:35,040
And the cranberry.

2626
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:37,040
Yes. Yes.

2627
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,040
Yes. Yes.

2628
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:41,600
You've got it. You've got it. You've got it.

2629
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:43,840
Yes. I did it.

2630
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:46,459
I did it. Yes.

2631
03:27:46,459 --> 03:27:48,459
Thank you. Thank you so much, chef.

2632
03:27:48,459 --> 03:27:50,459
Seriously.

2633
03:27:50,459 --> 03:27:52,459
Thank you so much, chef.

2634
03:27:52,459 --> 03:27:54,459
When I get to the next round, you better believe

2635
03:27:54,459 --> 03:27:56,459
I'm going to cook my ass off.

2636
03:27:56,459 --> 03:27:58,459
Yeah. Thank you, chef.

2637
03:27:58,459 --> 03:28:00,459
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

2638
03:28:00,459 --> 03:28:03,340
I'm the fucking man.

2639
03:28:03,340 --> 03:28:06,420
What do you got? Nothing?

2640
03:28:06,420 --> 03:28:10,639
That's me. I won.

2641
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:12,639
I'm going to the next round.

2642
03:28:15,709 --> 03:28:17,709
Something about that I didn't like.

2643
03:28:17,709 --> 03:28:20,209
Hold on a minute. Yes, chef.

2644
03:28:20,209 --> 03:28:23,090
Yes, chef.

2645
03:28:23,090 --> 03:28:25,090
I actually just had it before you did.

2646
03:28:25,090 --> 03:28:27,090
I just had some before you did.

2647
03:28:27,090 --> 03:28:30,399
I may have undercooked it.

2648
03:28:34,579 --> 03:28:38,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2649
03:28:38,420 --> 03:28:40,420
I think yours might be done

2650
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:45,540
more than mine.

2651
03:28:45,540 --> 03:28:47,540
Mine was a little underdone.

2652
03:28:47,540 --> 03:29:02,819
Yours will be okay, though. Yes, chef.

2653
03:29:02,819 --> 03:29:07,620
Cowboy?

2654
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:09,620
You should act as the chef.

2655
03:29:09,620 --> 03:29:11,790
The critiquing chef?

2656
03:29:11,790 --> 03:29:13,790
I don't even know how.

2657
03:29:13,790 --> 03:29:19,229
Fight a chef in the outfit.

2658
03:29:19,229 --> 03:29:22,430
Do the Wellington bit.

2659
03:29:22,430 --> 03:29:24,430
I don't have the outfit.

2660
03:29:24,430 --> 03:29:35,360
Ugh. Dodge an axe.

2661
03:29:35,360 --> 03:29:42,000
Let me see.

2662
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:49,680
Please do the stop it thing.

2663
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:55,059
We got time.

2664
03:29:55,059 --> 03:29:57,059
Don't do the Wellington thing.

2665
03:29:57,059 --> 03:30:04,030
I'm not doing the Wellington thing.

2666
03:30:04,030 --> 03:30:06,030
What do we got for the next costume?

2667
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:19,200
I'm trying to stay in the same

2668
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:21,200
clothing for a lot of them in a row

2669
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:23,200
because obviously it's easier

2670
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:25,200
to cut into.

2671
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:27,200
There were so many requests

2672
03:30:27,200 --> 03:30:29,200
and so many different costumes that

2673
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:33,620
I've seen so often.

2674
03:30:33,620 --> 03:30:54,979
Move this. So you want to draw?

2675
03:30:54,979 --> 03:31:00,139
You tell me when. Draw.

2676
03:31:00,139 --> 03:31:02,139
I must have lost.

2677
03:31:02,139 --> 03:31:22,930
Should have been more careful.

2678
03:31:22,930 --> 03:32:09,629
I've got one from this side.

2679
03:32:09,629 --> 03:32:24,459
I've got my eye on you. Be careful.

2680
03:32:24,459 --> 03:32:30,270
I've got one from up here. Let me tell you.

2681
03:32:30,270 --> 03:32:35,579
You be on your best behavior.

2682
03:32:35,579 --> 03:32:38,530
Why don't you give me a wink when you're ready to go?

2683
03:32:38,530 --> 03:32:49,389
Now!

2684
03:32:49,389 --> 03:32:58,290
I just shot myself.

2685
03:32:58,290 --> 03:33:00,290
Oh, panty for gold?

2686
03:33:00,290 --> 03:33:02,719
In this pan?

2687
03:33:02,719 --> 03:33:05,149
Fuck up this pan.

2688
03:33:05,149 --> 03:33:08,479
Should I wear the chef's hat for that too?

2689
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:10,479
I've got like gold chunks.

2690
03:33:10,479 --> 03:33:23,860
Yes, chef. Oh, behind.

2691
03:33:23,860 --> 03:33:33,440
We'll get a new pan. Yes, chef.

2692
03:33:33,440 --> 03:33:35,440
Yeah, I'm currently cooking a

2693
03:33:35,440 --> 03:33:37,940
gold nugget.

2694
03:33:37,940 --> 03:33:39,940
You're probably wondering where the mustache came from and where the hat came from.

2695
03:33:39,940 --> 03:33:42,559
I change my

2696
03:33:42,559 --> 03:33:55,979
outfits sometimes.

2697
03:33:55,979 --> 03:33:58,989
Hear that sizzle?

2698
03:33:58,989 --> 03:34:11,790
That's a sizzle right there.

2699
03:34:11,790 --> 03:34:17,280
Why does the chef have a gun?

2700
03:34:17,280 --> 03:34:19,280
Okay, nod occasionally and go

2701
03:34:19,280 --> 03:34:21,280
Yeah, yep, yeah, yep.

2702
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:24,930
Okay, well I want to do the

2703
03:34:24,930 --> 03:34:26,930
yeah, yep one.

2704
03:34:26,930 --> 03:34:41,870
Yeah. Yep.

2705
03:34:41,870 --> 03:34:45,260
Yes, sir. Yep.

2706
03:34:45,260 --> 03:34:51,069
Yeah. Yep.

2707
03:34:51,069 --> 03:34:57,260
Yep. Yeah.

2708
03:34:57,260 --> 03:35:03,069
Yep. Yeah.

2709
03:35:03,069 --> 03:35:07,149
Very interesting.

2710
03:35:07,149 --> 03:35:10,100
Very interesting.

2711
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:15,069
Yep. That's right.

2712
03:35:15,069 --> 03:35:21,649
Yes. Drink out of this thing.

2713
03:35:26,510 --> 03:35:37,969
I don't care.

2714
03:35:37,969 --> 03:35:49,659
It's full of flavor.

2715
03:35:49,659 --> 03:36:01,620
Yep.

2716
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:08,340
What's this one?

2717
03:36:08,340 --> 03:36:10,510
Get out. Get away.

2718
03:36:10,510 --> 03:36:21,379
Get. Crash.

2719
03:36:21,379 --> 03:36:28,100
Get out. Get again. Get out.

2720
03:36:28,100 --> 03:36:30,399
Yeehaw.

2721
03:36:30,399 --> 03:36:32,899
Oh, you. You over there.

2722
03:36:32,899 --> 03:36:34,899
Throat.

2723
03:36:34,899 --> 03:36:49,090
Anybody else have something to say?

2724
03:36:49,090 --> 03:37:07,520
Didn't think so.

2725
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:18,260
You missed one. Table.

2726
03:37:18,260 --> 03:37:21,200
Oh, okay. Write silent

2727
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:27,409
in a notebook.

2728
03:37:27,409 --> 03:37:29,409
I'm taking the hat off of this.

2729
03:37:29,409 --> 03:37:42,530
This is the mustache guy.

2730
03:37:42,530 --> 03:37:44,770
I love how the notebook is Bugleberry's cauldron

2731
03:37:44,770 --> 03:37:49,889
book. Okay, so just write silently

2732
03:37:49,889 --> 03:37:56,610
in a notebook.

2733
03:37:56,610 --> 03:39:52,379
Read it. Pretend not to understand

2734
03:39:52,379 --> 03:39:56,540
and throw it. What is wrong with this guy?

2735
03:39:56,540 --> 03:39:59,870
This mustache shirt

2736
03:39:59,870 --> 03:40:01,870
guy has been doing a lot of

2737
03:40:01,870 --> 03:40:15,950
fucking weird shit.

2738
03:40:15,950 --> 03:40:23,059
That can't be right. This can't be

2739
03:40:23,059 --> 03:40:35,010
right. No, no, no, no.

2740
03:40:35,010 --> 03:40:40,129
I don't understand.

2741
03:40:40,129 --> 03:40:56,700
I'll do one more violent.

2742
03:40:56,700 --> 03:40:59,329
No, what is what?

2743
03:40:59,329 --> 03:41:03,940
I don't get it.

2744
03:41:03,940 --> 03:41:18,260
I don't get it.

2745
03:41:18,260 --> 03:41:20,260
Any more for the guy with the mustache?

2746
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:25,700
Is somebody going to do 23?

2747
03:41:25,700 --> 03:41:31,139
He's reading

2748
03:41:31,139 --> 03:41:37,659
the Bible.

2749
03:41:37,659 --> 03:41:43,100
Eat plastic toys

2750
03:41:43,100 --> 03:41:46,620
at a table?

2751
03:41:50,209 --> 03:41:52,209
I kind of did that one already. Hacking into the main

2752
03:41:52,209 --> 03:41:54,209
frame.

2753
03:41:54,209 --> 03:41:56,510
Oh, I did the keyboard already.

2754
03:41:56,510 --> 03:41:59,950
Oh, with the

2755
03:41:59,950 --> 03:42:05,010
keyboard, yeah.

2756
03:42:05,010 --> 03:42:07,010
Slowly stroke the mustache. I can do that.

2757
03:42:07,010 --> 03:42:09,010
Not that way.

2758
03:42:09,010 --> 03:42:53,940
Slams hands.

2759
03:42:53,940 --> 03:42:57,389
Tick-tock

2760
03:42:57,389 --> 03:42:59,389
dances.

2761
03:42:59,389 --> 03:43:02,850
What are these tick-tock dances?

2762
03:43:02,850 --> 03:43:04,850
It's like do tick-tock dances.

2763
03:43:04,850 --> 03:43:13,680
What are they? I don't know

2764
03:43:13,680 --> 03:43:18,860
any tick-tock dances, really.

2765
03:43:18,860 --> 03:43:20,860
I definitely want to get into Spider-Man soon

2766
03:43:20,860 --> 03:43:32,129
because I think that's fucking hilarious.

2767
03:43:32,129 --> 03:43:34,129
No, what is this?

2768
03:43:34,129 --> 03:43:36,690
The power of God

2769
03:43:36,690 --> 03:43:38,690
and anime on my side.

2770
03:43:38,690 --> 03:43:42,659
I mean, should I

2771
03:43:42,659 --> 03:43:45,469
just do it in this?

2772
03:43:45,469 --> 03:43:47,469
Yeah, I took the jeans off because

2773
03:43:47,469 --> 03:43:49,469
it's like 110 degrees.

2774
03:43:49,469 --> 03:43:51,709
I had that gray shirt

2775
03:43:51,709 --> 03:43:53,709
for continuity and the jeans

2776
03:43:53,709 --> 03:43:55,709
and I was like, I always wanted to puke. It was so hot.

2777
03:43:55,709 --> 03:43:58,719
Alright, so I have the power

2778
03:43:58,719 --> 03:44:00,719
of God and anime?

2779
03:44:00,719 --> 03:44:08,379
So you want me to just do that?

2780
03:44:08,379 --> 03:44:11,389
Like this?

2781
03:44:11,389 --> 03:44:15,940
A weapon?

2782
03:44:15,940 --> 03:44:18,239
So I dance around and move around and I go, I have the power

2783
03:44:18,239 --> 03:44:20,239
of God and anime on my side.

2784
03:44:20,239 --> 03:44:23,700
Who is this for?

2785
03:44:23,700 --> 03:44:30,420
I have the power of God

2786
03:44:30,420 --> 03:44:32,420
and anime on my side.

2787
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:42,129
Scream?

2788
03:44:42,129 --> 03:44:44,129
I have the power of God and anime on my side.

2789
03:44:44,129 --> 03:44:54,049
Is that good enough?

2790
03:44:54,049 --> 03:45:46,129
I still have to do the accordion.

2791
03:45:46,129 --> 03:45:56,819
The mime outfit?

2792
03:45:56,819 --> 03:45:59,440
I'm just going to stay.

2793
03:45:59,440 --> 03:46:01,440
I'm just going to stay in this.

2794
03:46:01,440 --> 03:46:03,739
In the boat?

2795
03:46:03,739 --> 03:46:12,319
I feel like I should stay as the same guy

2796
03:46:12,319 --> 03:46:26,270
for a while. I learned this one.

2797
03:46:26,270 --> 03:46:33,549
All of you.

2798
03:46:33,549 --> 03:46:35,549
This water is so

2799
03:46:35,549 --> 03:46:40,989
dirty.

2800
03:46:40,989 --> 03:46:42,989
I learned this one when I was traveling

2801
03:46:42,989 --> 03:46:49,629
abroad, right?

2802
03:47:03,459 --> 03:47:20,139
Please clap.

2803
03:47:28,399 --> 03:47:37,360
Don't splash me.

2804
03:47:37,360 --> 03:47:39,360
Don't splash me. Throw him out. He splashed me

2805
03:47:39,360 --> 03:47:41,360
with water. Don't splash

2806
03:47:41,360 --> 03:47:43,360
me. Splashing. You can't splash here.

2807
03:47:43,360 --> 03:47:45,360
It says it on the sign before we walked in.

2808
03:47:45,360 --> 03:47:47,360
Don't splash people.

2809
03:47:47,360 --> 03:47:49,360
Don't splash.

2810
03:47:49,360 --> 03:47:51,360
Fucking idiot.

2811
03:47:51,360 --> 03:47:54,940
Don't splash you.

2812
03:47:54,940 --> 03:48:02,370
Throw him out. Throw him out.

2813
03:48:02,370 --> 03:48:15,040
Toss me there.

2814
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:18,110
I'm getting away from him.

2815
03:48:18,110 --> 03:48:20,110
Those of you that want to hear another song,

2816
03:48:20,110 --> 03:48:22,110
follow me please.

2817
03:48:22,110 --> 03:48:27,360
This one's called

2818
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:35,920
The Train Tracks.

2819
03:48:35,920 --> 03:48:38,290
No. This one's called

2820
03:48:38,290 --> 03:48:42,059
The Mandalorian Theme Song.

2821
03:48:42,059 --> 03:48:44,819
Give me that

2822
03:48:44,819 --> 03:48:46,819
pigeon.

2823
03:48:46,819 --> 03:49:21,950
This is a goddamn

2824
03:49:21,950 --> 03:49:31,809
children's toy.

2825
03:49:31,809 --> 03:49:48,829
What'd I get?

2826
03:49:48,829 --> 03:49:52,159
Oh.

2827
03:49:52,159 --> 03:49:58,559
That's a big one.

2828
03:49:58,559 --> 03:50:05,260
It's getting tangled.

2829
03:50:05,260 --> 03:50:12,049
I'll get one more out there. There we go.

2830
03:50:12,049 --> 03:50:14,049
There we go. That's a bite.

2831
03:50:14,049 --> 03:50:16,420
There it is. There we go.

2832
03:50:16,420 --> 03:50:27,489
That's

2833
03:50:27,489 --> 03:50:29,489
a big one right here. That's a huge one.

2834
03:50:29,489 --> 03:50:35,059
I'll take a picture of that.

2835
03:50:35,059 --> 03:50:37,420
Whoever's got a camera. You got one?

2836
03:50:37,420 --> 03:50:41,069
Take a picture of this one.

2837
03:50:41,069 --> 03:50:43,069
Cheese. I gave you the finger.

2838
03:50:43,069 --> 03:50:45,069
You can't use that anywhere now.

2839
03:50:45,069 --> 03:50:48,340
Can't put that on fucking Facebook or anything.

2840
03:50:48,340 --> 03:50:50,340
I'm here on vacation.

2841
03:50:50,340 --> 03:50:58,340
Shut up.

2842
03:50:58,340 --> 03:51:02,559
What's next?

2843
03:51:02,559 --> 03:51:04,559
Any more mean guy with the mustache?

2844
03:51:04,559 --> 03:51:16,399
You should walk on water.

2845
03:51:16,399 --> 03:51:24,909
Apology?

2846
03:51:24,909 --> 03:51:26,909
Oh, like an apology video.

2847
03:51:26,909 --> 03:51:29,280
Should I do an apology video

2848
03:51:29,280 --> 03:51:31,280
as the guy with the mustache on?

2849
03:51:31,280 --> 03:51:35,379
For all the things he's been doing?

2850
03:51:35,379 --> 03:51:37,379
Oh, in case I don't see you.

2851
03:51:37,379 --> 03:51:51,250
That's

2852
03:51:51,250 --> 03:51:53,250
some of my shit I've been doing.

2853
03:51:53,250 --> 03:51:58,819
The guy with the mustache

2854
03:51:58,819 --> 03:52:00,819
is just heinous.

2855
03:52:00,819 --> 03:52:02,819
And has to make a YouTube apology video for all

2856
03:52:02,819 --> 03:52:04,819
this stupid shit he's been...

2857
03:52:04,819 --> 03:52:22,979
Good afternoon. My name is...

2858
03:52:22,979 --> 03:52:26,299
My name was not in Borden, actually.

2859
03:52:26,299 --> 03:52:32,049
Good afternoon.

2860
03:52:32,049 --> 03:52:35,250
I just want to make this video really quickly

2861
03:52:35,250 --> 03:52:38,190
to say

2862
03:52:38,190 --> 03:52:40,430
I'm sorry for

2863
03:52:40,430 --> 03:52:42,430
the way that I've been acting while I was on vacation.

2864
03:52:42,430 --> 03:52:45,059
There's been various videos

2865
03:52:45,059 --> 03:52:47,059
around that have been surfacing out about my

2866
03:52:47,059 --> 03:52:49,059
time traveling.

2867
03:52:49,059 --> 03:52:51,229
And I just want to say

2868
03:52:51,229 --> 03:52:53,600
from the bottom of my heart, very sorry

2869
03:52:53,600 --> 03:52:55,600
for the way I've been acting.

2870
03:52:55,600 --> 03:52:57,600
Very sorry for the dumb things that I've been saying.

2871
03:52:57,600 --> 03:52:59,899
And a lot of people

2872
03:52:59,899 --> 03:53:01,899
have coined me the

2873
03:53:01,899 --> 03:53:03,899
mean mustache guy.

2874
03:53:03,899 --> 03:53:05,899
Mean mustache guy.

2875
03:53:05,899 --> 03:53:08,899
I gotta say, that hurts.

2876
03:53:08,899 --> 03:53:11,200
I don't think that's very fair.

2877
03:53:11,200 --> 03:53:13,200
I think everything I said was

2878
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:15,200
I was very angry at certain things

2879
03:53:15,200 --> 03:53:17,200
and certain people has splashed a few people, but whatever.

2880
03:53:17,200 --> 03:53:19,200
I don't want to be that.

2881
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:21,200
I'm not the angry mustache guy.

2882
03:53:21,200 --> 03:53:23,629
My name is

2883
03:53:23,629 --> 03:53:25,629
Sean.

2884
03:53:25,629 --> 03:53:28,319
That's what you can call me now.

2885
03:53:28,319 --> 03:53:30,319
Not angry mustache guy

2886
03:53:30,319 --> 03:53:32,319
that you see on YouTube.

2887
03:53:32,319 --> 03:53:36,530
Sean.

2888
03:53:36,530 --> 03:53:38,530
Anyways, I'm sorry for all

2889
03:53:38,530 --> 03:53:40,530
the things that I've been saying. The things I did.

2890
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:42,899
Hopefully I can

2891
03:53:42,899 --> 03:53:45,840
get back to normal now.

2892
03:53:45,840 --> 03:53:47,840
I really just hope so.

2893
03:53:47,840 --> 03:53:50,139
I've been very, very

2894
03:53:50,139 --> 03:53:52,139
the last five or six days have been

2895
03:53:52,139 --> 03:53:54,450
a little interesting.

2896
03:53:54,450 --> 03:53:56,450
So I'm sorry.

2897
03:53:56,450 --> 03:53:58,450
What else do you want me to say? Do you want any more than that?

2898
03:53:58,450 --> 03:54:00,450
I'm very sorry.

2899
03:54:00,450 --> 03:54:02,450
I'm incredibly sorry. Do you want more than that?

2900
03:54:02,450 --> 03:54:06,610
That's all I'm going to give you.

2901
03:54:06,610 --> 03:54:09,659
But I do apologize.

2902
03:54:09,659 --> 03:54:11,659
So good night. Have a great rest of your evening.

2903
03:54:11,659 --> 03:54:14,030
And keep

2904
03:54:14,030 --> 03:54:16,530
keep going.

2905
03:54:16,530 --> 03:54:18,899
Whatever you're doing.

2906
03:54:18,899 --> 03:54:20,899
I'm going to go back to being a good person.

2907
03:54:20,899 --> 03:54:23,329
You just wait. Good person Sean

2908
03:54:23,329 --> 03:54:25,329
is what you'll call me. Not this.

2909
03:54:25,329 --> 03:54:27,329
I'm shaving this. Good person Sean

2910
03:54:27,329 --> 03:54:34,670
is coming up. It's me.

2911
03:54:34,670 --> 03:54:36,670
And the funny thing is immediately after that you could show

2912
03:54:36,670 --> 03:54:38,670
another TikTok UI video of me

2913
03:54:38,670 --> 03:54:43,600
being terrible.

2914
03:54:43,600 --> 03:54:49,620
Shaved Sean.

2915
03:54:49,620 --> 03:54:51,620
Shaved Sean.

2916
03:54:51,620 --> 03:54:53,620
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2917
03:54:53,620 --> 03:54:55,620
I'm shaved now.

2918
03:54:55,620 --> 03:55:02,979
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2919
03:55:02,979 --> 03:55:05,540
That's what I hear. Shut up.

2920
03:55:05,540 --> 03:55:09,120
Shut up. Yeah.

2921
03:55:09,120 --> 03:55:11,739
Shut the fuck up.

2922
03:55:11,739 --> 03:55:13,739
Stupid. You're all stupid idiots.

2923
03:55:13,739 --> 03:55:17,250
You're dumb.

2924
03:55:17,250 --> 03:55:21,200
You're the dumbest one here.

2925
03:55:21,200 --> 03:55:23,200
Turn that off.

2926
03:55:23,200 --> 03:55:25,200
Turn that off. I'm shaved Sean.

2927
03:55:25,200 --> 03:55:27,200
I'm a different person now. Turn that camera up.

2928
03:55:27,200 --> 03:55:35,950
Hold on a minute.

2929
03:55:35,950 --> 03:55:37,950
Back up. Everybody back up. I'll prove it.

2930
03:55:37,950 --> 03:56:07,069
I'll prove to you that I'm a good person.

2931
03:56:07,069 --> 03:56:11,299
What's your name? I feel great.

2932
03:56:11,299 --> 03:56:14,110
Ever since it was...

2933
03:56:14,110 --> 03:56:16,479
I feel like a completely different person.

2934
03:56:16,479 --> 03:56:18,479
Your name? Dave?

2935
03:56:18,479 --> 03:56:20,479
I'm Sean. Shaved Sean.

2936
03:56:20,479 --> 03:56:23,549
From now on. Do you need help?

2937
03:56:23,549 --> 03:56:25,549
I could help you guys with anything you need.

2938
03:56:25,549 --> 03:56:27,549
I could help you move that furniture.

2939
03:56:27,549 --> 03:56:29,729
Shaved Sean here.

2940
03:56:29,729 --> 03:56:32,100
That's right. Yeah.

2941
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:44,379
Much love to everybody here.

2942
03:56:44,379 --> 03:56:46,379
I was going to do a routine where I shaved my balls.

2943
03:56:46,379 --> 03:56:55,979
Never mind.

2944
03:56:55,979 --> 03:56:57,979
Fuck. Have we been doing this before?

2945
03:56:57,979 --> 03:56:59,979
Have we been doing this for four hours?

2946
03:56:59,979 --> 03:57:05,090
What? What the fuck?

2947
03:57:05,090 --> 03:57:07,709
I think we should end on this maybe.

2948
03:57:07,709 --> 03:57:13,409
Yeah. Let me get into that right now.

2949
03:57:13,409 --> 03:57:15,409
Yeah. We're going to do another costume change.

2950
03:57:15,409 --> 03:57:20,399
This is an important costume change.

2951
03:57:20,399 --> 03:57:22,399
I feel like this is going to be somebody's...

2952
03:57:22,399 --> 03:57:25,860
some of you guys' favorite of the night.

2953
03:57:25,860 --> 03:57:47,040
Another change. I'll be right back.

2954
03:57:47,040 --> 03:57:49,040
I can do this one real quick. Somebody said please do the Truman Show thing.

2955
03:57:49,040 --> 03:57:51,040
Alright.

2956
03:57:51,040 --> 03:58:03,709
I need the briefcase.

2957
03:58:03,709 --> 03:58:08,059
Howdy. Hey.

2958
03:58:08,059 --> 03:58:10,059
In case I don't see you. Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

2959
03:58:10,059 --> 03:58:19,139
There you go.

2960
03:58:19,139 --> 03:58:29,250
You forgot good morning?

2961
03:58:29,250 --> 03:58:31,250
Oh, whatever.

2962
03:58:31,250 --> 03:58:46,020
This one...

2963
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:48,020
Let me just show you what I'm changing.

2964
03:58:48,020 --> 03:58:50,020
Everyone that's like, oh, that must be the end.

2965
03:58:50,020 --> 03:58:54,799
No, it's not.

2966
03:58:54,799 --> 04:01:29,549
We got a lot to do with this guy.

2967
04:01:29,549 --> 04:02:01,219
Can anybody hear me?

2968
04:02:01,219 --> 04:02:14,909
How do I work this fucking thing?

2969
04:02:14,909 --> 04:02:33,139
Put it all again, Steve.

2970
04:02:33,139 --> 04:02:35,440
This is not my fucking video.

2971
04:02:35,440 --> 04:02:37,440
It's not like college dorm room.

2972
04:02:37,440 --> 04:02:44,989
It's just...

2973
04:02:44,989 --> 04:02:46,989
It's just that college dorm room video.

2974
04:02:46,989 --> 04:03:15,520
I want to...

2975
04:03:15,520 --> 04:03:17,520
Okay.

2976
04:03:17,520 --> 04:03:19,700
It's going to be that college video every time.

2977
04:03:19,700 --> 04:03:22,190
Whatever. Why would I have a tricycle this small?

2978
04:03:22,190 --> 04:03:25,069
Why wouldn't I get one for adults?

2979
04:03:25,069 --> 04:03:27,569
Get one for adults.

2980
04:03:27,569 --> 04:03:30,239
Not ones for children.

2981
04:03:30,239 --> 04:03:42,209
Adults can't ride these.

2982
04:03:42,209 --> 04:03:47,549
Hello again, Peter. It's me, Saul.

2983
04:03:47,549 --> 04:03:49,549
You're probably wondering why you're here.

2984
04:03:49,549 --> 04:03:52,110
What you're doing, locked up down here.

2985
04:03:52,110 --> 04:03:56,899
Well, I'll tell you.

2986
04:03:56,899 --> 04:03:58,899
Six weeks ago, you had

2987
04:03:58,899 --> 04:04:00,899
over 40 pornhub tabs open at the same time.

2988
04:04:00,899 --> 04:04:03,459
And you crashed your computer.

2989
04:04:03,459 --> 04:04:06,459
So now you have

2990
04:04:06,459 --> 04:04:08,459
40 computers with

2991
04:04:08,459 --> 04:04:11,409
40 different porn videos on them.

2992
04:04:11,409 --> 04:04:13,409
40 separate pornography videos.

2993
04:04:13,409 --> 04:04:16,030
You need to go and

2994
04:04:16,030 --> 04:04:19,620
close them all before the knock on the door

2995
04:04:19,620 --> 04:04:23,440
of your mother finds you.

2996
04:04:23,440 --> 04:04:26,059
You have one minute. Make your choice.

2997
04:04:26,059 --> 04:04:44,350
Oh, by the way, Peter,

2998
04:04:44,350 --> 04:04:46,350
forgot to mention. I know you only have 45

2999
04:04:46,350 --> 04:04:49,100
seconds left. The room

3000
04:04:49,100 --> 04:04:53,500
is about to fill with gas.

3001
04:04:53,500 --> 04:04:56,510
Nerve gas. Oh, I know

3002
04:04:56,510 --> 04:04:58,510
nerve gas very well. I said

3003
04:04:58,510 --> 04:05:00,510
nerve gas in SAW 1 through

3004
04:05:00,510 --> 04:05:02,510
5 over 200

3005
04:05:02,510 --> 04:05:06,530
times. You don't think I know?

3006
04:05:06,530 --> 04:05:08,530
It's a deadly nerve agent

3007
04:05:08,530 --> 04:05:10,530
and it will poison your

3008
04:05:10,530 --> 04:05:14,500
blood. Make your choice. You have 10

3009
04:05:14,500 --> 04:05:18,530
seconds. As the poison courses

3010
04:05:18,530 --> 04:05:21,659
through your veins, as the gas

3011
04:05:21,659 --> 04:05:24,799
fills your lungs.

3012
04:05:24,799 --> 04:05:26,799
Will you be able to succeed?

3013
04:05:26,799 --> 04:05:33,379
Oh, you did it. You did it.

3014
04:05:33,379 --> 04:05:36,059
Hey, Pete did it.

3015
04:05:36,059 --> 04:05:39,700
You actually did it.

3016
04:05:39,700 --> 04:05:42,510
Steve, what's your name again? I forget.

3017
04:05:42,510 --> 04:05:45,139
Good job. Go through the door.

3018
04:05:45,139 --> 04:05:47,819
Go out the door. You did it. Nice

3019
04:05:47,819 --> 04:05:54,159
job. You actually did it. Outside

3020
04:05:54,159 --> 04:05:56,909
of that door is another 50 computers

3021
04:05:56,909 --> 04:06:00,110
with 50 pornhub tabs open.

3022
04:06:00,110 --> 04:06:05,090
You must.

3023
04:06:05,090 --> 04:06:07,090
The hair is getting into my eyes.

3024
04:06:07,090 --> 04:06:17,950
No, I don't want them to know my identity.

3025
04:06:17,950 --> 04:06:24,350
Inside of this room, 10 bear traps on the ground.

3026
04:06:24,350 --> 04:06:27,680
You have three minutes to find

3027
04:06:27,680 --> 04:06:30,299
the key. Unlock the bear trap

3028
04:06:30,299 --> 04:06:33,629
that's around your head. Traps

3029
04:06:33,629 --> 04:06:35,940
everywhere. So when you step around, you have to be

3030
04:06:35,940 --> 04:06:37,940
very careful that you won't step in a bear trap.

3031
04:06:37,940 --> 04:06:41,069
You step in one of those, your leg will be

3032
04:06:41,069 --> 04:06:43,069
severed at the knee, John.

3033
04:06:43,069 --> 04:06:48,299
Also, the room is going to fill with gas.

3034
04:06:48,299 --> 04:06:51,549
At the same time, tons of

3035
04:06:51,549 --> 04:06:56,420
gas will fill the room. Gas!

3036
04:06:56,420 --> 04:07:08,819
And you'll die. Make your choice.

3037
04:07:08,819 --> 04:07:14,770
I'm not going to twerk his jigsaw, I'm kidding.

3038
04:07:14,770 --> 04:07:18,420
Any requests? Is the bowtie fucked up?

3039
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:24,530
Oh, is it? A drug?

3040
04:07:24,530 --> 04:07:27,280
No!

3041
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:29,280
No, dude!

3042
04:07:29,280 --> 04:07:38,739
Yeah, you want to fix it?

3043
04:07:38,739 --> 04:07:40,739
A drug? The drug?

3044
04:07:40,739 --> 04:07:51,170
A drug PSA? Oh my

3045
04:07:51,170 --> 04:08:09,329
god. Alright. Hello again.

3046
04:08:09,329 --> 04:08:12,659
It is I, Jigsaw, here to tell

3047
04:08:12,659 --> 04:08:15,979
you that you have a choice to me.

3048
04:08:15,979 --> 04:08:24,799
And it's time for you to me. We're talking about drugs.

3049
04:08:24,799 --> 04:08:28,879
How you should not do them. We all have a choice.

3050
04:08:28,879 --> 04:08:30,879
Hi, everybody. I'm the actor that plays Jigsaw.

3051
04:08:30,879 --> 04:08:33,549
Jeremy Albertson. I just want to make

3052
04:08:33,549 --> 04:08:35,549
sure that everyone's aware that if you

3053
04:08:35,549 --> 04:08:38,049
are approached with somebody offering

3054
04:08:38,049 --> 04:08:40,930
a drug or an alcohol, you can

3055
04:08:40,930 --> 04:08:44,559
refuse. There's no reason to do it.

3056
04:08:44,559 --> 04:08:46,739
So, if we could all have

3057
04:08:46,739 --> 04:08:49,549
our own Jigsaw's

3058
04:08:49,549 --> 04:08:52,540
puzzles to complete in our heads

3059
04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:55,739
to Western Pennsylvania

3060
04:08:55,739 --> 04:08:57,739
as the most patriotic.

3061
04:08:57,739 --> 04:08:59,979
I'm just like finding words.

3062
04:08:59,979 --> 04:09:06,819
I'm just

3063
04:09:06,819 --> 04:09:17,569
kind of like stuck. Hello again,

3064
04:09:17,569 --> 04:09:21,090
Internet. No. Hello again,

3065
04:09:21,090 --> 04:09:24,799
John. What you see before you

3066
04:09:24,799 --> 04:09:28,000
is a choice. A very important

3067
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:31,840
choice. One that will live with you forever.

3068
04:09:31,840 --> 04:09:35,600
But you can make it. You might be able

3069
04:09:35,600 --> 04:09:39,120
to save yourself. I'm of course talking about

3070
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:42,450
drugs and alcohol. Hi, everyone. My name

3071
04:09:42,450 --> 04:09:44,879
is Sean Albertson. I play the character

3072
04:09:44,879 --> 04:09:46,879
Jigsaw on the daytime TV

3073
04:09:46,879 --> 04:09:48,879
show. Jigsaw is coming

3074
04:09:48,879 --> 04:09:51,440
for you. I wanted to make sure I did

3075
04:09:51,440 --> 04:09:53,440
this quick little PSA that

3076
04:09:53,440 --> 04:09:55,680
we all have a choice

3077
04:09:55,680 --> 04:09:57,920
to make. And that's drugs and alcohol.

3078
04:09:57,920 --> 04:10:01,360
No reason to do them. Drugs are something

3079
04:10:01,360 --> 04:10:03,659
if you ever approached and pressured, make

3080
04:10:03,659 --> 04:10:06,719
your choice and say no. No to

3081
04:10:06,719 --> 04:10:18,030
drugs. Thank you. Now let's get back

3082
04:10:18,030 --> 04:10:25,309
to the show. There's a key

3083
04:10:25,309 --> 04:10:28,059
inside of your eyeball. You need to

3084
04:10:28,059 --> 04:10:30,059
dig it out with your bare hands and then eat it.

3085
04:10:30,059 --> 04:10:32,500
And then shit it out. When you shit it out,

3086
04:10:32,500 --> 04:10:34,500
then only then can you use the key

3087
04:10:34,500 --> 04:10:36,500
to unlock the bear trap that's around John's neck.

3088
04:10:54,620 --> 04:11:01,190
Wait, wait, wait. How did he get in here?

3089
04:11:01,190 --> 04:11:03,559
How did he get in here? How did he get in here?

3090
04:11:03,559 --> 04:11:05,930
You're not supposed to be able to get in here.

3091
04:11:05,930 --> 04:11:08,920
Ow. Ouch. No.

3092
04:11:08,920 --> 04:11:10,920
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

3093
04:11:10,920 --> 04:11:13,100
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. You didn't make your

3094
04:11:13,100 --> 04:11:15,399
choice. Your choice is if he killed me.

3095
04:11:15,399 --> 04:11:31,299
Hi, everyone. My name is Sean Elberton.

3096
04:11:31,299 --> 04:11:34,360
I'm the actor, writer, director, producer,

3097
04:11:34,360 --> 04:11:36,360
and main talent of the daytime

3098
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:38,600
television show Jigsaw is Here.

3099
04:11:38,600 --> 04:11:41,860
And I just have something very

3100
04:11:41,860 --> 04:11:43,860
important that we all have to do. We have to make choices.

3101
04:11:43,860 --> 04:11:46,420
And one choice is for you to watch this show

3102
04:11:46,420 --> 04:11:49,610
because the ratings have been very poor

3103
04:11:49,610 --> 04:11:52,739
and I believe that we are

3104
04:11:52,739 --> 04:11:54,739
below reruns of infomercials at this point.

3105
04:11:54,739 --> 04:11:57,370
So I figured we could give you a

3106
04:11:57,370 --> 04:11:59,370
quick little, like maybe you could watch the show if you want.

3107
04:11:59,370 --> 04:12:01,610
For the

3108
04:12:01,610 --> 04:12:03,610
six to seven hundred of you that do watch

3109
04:12:03,610 --> 04:12:06,409
the show, thank you so much.

3110
04:12:06,409 --> 04:12:08,409
It means a lot. The cast and crew,

3111
04:12:08,409 --> 04:12:11,030
we obviously put a lot of time into this show.

3112
04:12:11,030 --> 04:12:13,030
So we'll get back to it though. Let's get back to your regularly scheduled

3113
04:12:13,030 --> 04:12:15,399
programming of Jigsaw's Coming for You,

3114
04:12:15,399 --> 04:12:17,399
written and directed, starring, and produced by

3115
04:12:17,399 --> 04:12:20,860
me, Sean Elberton.

3116
04:12:20,860 --> 04:12:30,569
What is it?

3117
04:12:30,569 --> 04:12:32,569
He isn't pretending.

3118
04:12:32,569 --> 04:12:34,809
He's playing a

3119
04:12:34,809 --> 04:12:39,100
kid actor.

3120
04:12:39,100 --> 04:12:41,100
Do a family guy rag doll as

3121
04:12:41,100 --> 04:12:43,100
Jigsaw. Oh my god.

3122
04:12:43,100 --> 04:12:46,420
It's okay.

3123
04:12:46,420 --> 04:12:48,420
I'm going to be dead on the ground anyways.

3124
04:12:48,420 --> 04:12:50,420
Oh, yeah, they're having a hard time hearing you. Oh, it flipped.

3125
04:12:50,420 --> 04:12:52,790
That's why. Oh, it flipped. Can you mute it?

3126
04:12:52,790 --> 04:12:54,790
Oh, it should be. You know what? The batteries are dying.

3127
04:12:54,790 --> 04:12:57,420
Should we go with the other one?

3128
04:12:57,420 --> 04:13:02,340
I think I got another minute. I still want to do

3129
04:13:02,340 --> 04:13:04,840
Spider-Man. This is like too much

3130
04:13:04,840 --> 04:13:08,420
fun. Okay, here's the problem.

3131
04:13:08,420 --> 04:13:10,420
Like, I always come to these things

3132
04:13:10,420 --> 04:13:13,430
with so much shit.

3133
04:13:13,430 --> 04:13:15,989
And I just, like,

3134
04:13:15,989 --> 04:13:18,549
I have so many more things here.

3135
04:13:18,549 --> 04:13:25,829
Don't make it the last one.

3136
04:13:25,829 --> 04:13:29,290
It's

3137
04:13:29,290 --> 04:13:31,780
too fun. All right, we're going to do some speed runs.

3138
04:13:31,780 --> 04:13:36,260
We'll do speed runs. All right, all right, all right.

3139
04:13:36,260 --> 04:13:38,260
Here's the deal. I'm going to do

3140
04:13:38,260 --> 04:13:43,000
I'm going to get out of Jigsaw.

3141
04:13:43,000 --> 04:13:47,350
I can't believe I did that college video.

3142
04:13:47,350 --> 04:13:49,350
Okay, let me get into Spider-Man and we'll do some Spider-Man

3143
04:13:49,350 --> 04:13:56,440
stuff because I need

3144
04:13:56,440 --> 04:13:58,870
to be, we've got to be out of here in

3145
04:13:58,870 --> 04:14:02,260
two or three hours.

3146
04:14:02,260 --> 04:14:04,260
It's going to take about an hour or two to pack up.

3147
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:06,500
So really only have like another 45

3148
04:14:06,500 --> 04:14:08,809
minutes to an hour. So let me

3149
04:14:08,809 --> 04:14:11,110
try to speed run some stuff.

3150
04:14:11,110 --> 04:14:15,780
We'll put on Spider-Man. I'll be right back.

3151
04:14:15,780 --> 04:15:16,329
Let's do this real quick.

3152
04:15:16,329 --> 04:15:26,940
Uh-uh. No strings.

3153
04:15:26,940 --> 04:15:31,219
Ta-da.

3154
04:15:31,219 --> 04:15:39,079
Hey. Where'd he go?

3155
04:15:39,079 --> 04:15:41,079
Where's the bunny?

3156
04:15:41,079 --> 04:15:47,340
Where'd the bunny go? I don't know.

3157
04:15:47,340 --> 04:15:50,469
Where's that rabbit? Uh-oh.

3158
04:15:50,469 --> 04:15:52,469
Jigsaw's

3159
04:15:52,469 --> 04:15:55,540
tricycle. You know what's really funny

3160
04:15:55,540 --> 04:15:57,540
about that though? We built that.

3161
04:15:57,540 --> 04:15:59,540
We put the tricycle together and I actually rode

3162
04:15:59,540 --> 04:16:01,540
it around my living room

3163
04:16:01,540 --> 04:16:03,540
for like 10 seconds and it was fine.

3164
04:16:03,540 --> 04:16:05,540
So of course it like blows up here.

3165
04:16:05,540 --> 04:16:07,540
You were, you rode it too and it was fine.

3166
04:16:07,540 --> 04:16:10,680
I think I put way too much

3167
04:16:10,680 --> 04:16:12,680
weight on it because I couldn't see.

3168
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:28,299
Yeah, put that on a birthday card. I don't care.

3169
04:16:28,299 --> 04:16:30,299
Do, use it whatever you want.

3170
04:16:30,299 --> 04:16:36,379
Oh, let me see that.

3171
04:16:36,379 --> 04:17:08,489
What? How did I tie it in a knot?

3172
04:17:08,489 --> 04:17:11,879
I don't know. I tied it in a knot somehow.

3173
04:17:11,879 --> 04:17:13,879
What is going on?

3174
04:17:13,879 --> 04:17:20,020
How does this work?

3175
04:17:20,020 --> 04:17:28,709
Oh, I get it. Alright. I get it.

3176
04:17:28,709 --> 04:17:32,549
I get it. I get it. Okay.

3177
04:17:32,549 --> 04:17:46,629
I get it. It keeps bunching up.

3178
04:17:46,629 --> 04:17:49,129
It's bunching up. I don't know what to do.

3179
04:17:49,129 --> 04:17:51,940
Is this thing still on?

3180
04:17:51,940 --> 04:17:57,370
Can you hear me? How am I doing this wrong?

3181
04:17:57,370 --> 04:18:00,819
I don't understand how I'm doing this wrong.

3182
04:18:00,819 --> 04:18:08,569
I'm doing it wrong apparently. Is this a regular deck of cards?

3183
04:18:08,569 --> 04:18:21,350
Alright, what do you got?

3184
04:18:21,350 --> 04:18:23,590
There you go. Pick a card.

3185
04:18:23,590 --> 04:18:25,590
Pick a card. Any card. I don't want to see.

3186
04:18:25,590 --> 04:18:29,850
Pick a card. Pick a card.

3187
04:18:29,850 --> 04:18:32,860
This one? That one right there?

3188
04:18:32,860 --> 04:18:34,860
Pick that one. Gonna stick it back in the deck

3189
04:18:34,860 --> 04:18:37,159
right here. Check that out. Cut it.

3190
04:18:37,159 --> 04:18:42,500
Cut it again. Cut it again. Cut it again.

3191
04:18:42,500 --> 04:18:49,020
Cut it again. Cut it again.

3192
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:53,049
What was it again? What was that card?

3193
04:18:53,049 --> 04:18:56,100
That one. Right there, wasn't it?

3194
04:18:56,100 --> 04:18:59,739
Bingo. Wanna pick another one?

3195
04:18:59,739 --> 04:19:02,100
Pick another card. Take another one. Which one do you want?

3196
04:19:02,100 --> 04:19:04,100
Anyone. Anyone. Come on. Come on. Come on.

3197
04:19:04,100 --> 04:19:06,100
Which one? Which one? This one right here? That one?

3198
04:19:06,100 --> 04:19:08,280
That one? This is your card? That's your card right there?

3199
04:19:08,280 --> 04:19:10,649
Let's get that back in the deck.

3200
04:19:10,649 --> 04:19:13,270
Tuck it in there. There it is.

3201
04:19:13,270 --> 04:19:16,659
Cut. Cut the deck. Cut the deck. Hold on now.

3202
04:19:16,659 --> 04:19:18,899
I'm working on it. Cut the deck again.

3203
04:19:18,899 --> 04:19:22,860
Cut the deck again. Spin that around.

3204
04:19:22,860 --> 04:19:25,930
Cut the deck again. Okay.

3205
04:19:25,930 --> 04:19:27,930
And guess what? I'll put it behind my gosh darn head.

3206
04:19:27,930 --> 04:19:31,059
See? I don't know.

3207
04:19:31,059 --> 04:19:34,010
I don't know where it is. I have no idea.

3208
04:19:34,010 --> 04:19:39,180
Not a clue. Not a clue.

3209
04:19:39,180 --> 04:19:44,920
Is that the card right there?

3210
04:19:44,920 --> 04:19:46,920
Oh.

3211
04:19:46,920 --> 04:19:50,379
It's a joker.

3212
04:19:50,379 --> 04:19:55,590
Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you.

3213
04:19:55,590 --> 04:19:57,959
You're right. Absolutely.

3214
04:19:57,959 --> 04:20:09,219
Let's do this now. Ready? Check this out.

3215
04:20:09,219 --> 04:20:18,889
Is that your card? Oh yeah, it makes it.

3216
04:20:18,889 --> 04:20:26,629
That's funny. Let's make the

3217
04:20:26,629 --> 04:20:32,709
chair disappear. Oh, I didn't even do any

3218
04:20:32,709 --> 04:20:34,709
lightsaber stuff. There's so much

3219
04:20:34,709 --> 04:20:36,709
lightsaber stuff from the other couple of times.

3220
04:20:36,709 --> 04:20:50,729
You guys can figure out what to do.

3221
04:20:50,729 --> 04:21:23,540
Watch. Watch. Watch.

3222
04:21:23,540 --> 04:22:09,340
It's gone.

3223
04:22:09,340 --> 04:22:13,290
Thank you. Thank you.

3224
04:22:13,290 --> 04:22:19,430
Thank you. A rose.

3225
04:22:19,430 --> 04:22:29,100
Oh, I missed. What do I do with this?

3226
04:22:29,100 --> 04:22:37,590
I don't get it. What is this? What do you do with this?

3227
04:22:37,590 --> 04:22:47,500
You light it on fire?

3228
04:22:47,500 --> 04:22:49,500
This one's called, this next one's called sit down.

3229
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:52,170
Sit down and stop talking during the show.

3230
04:22:52,170 --> 04:22:55,430
This next trick is called

3231
04:22:55,430 --> 04:23:16,280
fire rose.

3232
04:23:16,280 --> 04:23:23,180
Thank you. Thank you very much.

3233
04:23:23,180 --> 04:23:27,530
Don't be alarmed. Don't be alarmed.

3234
04:23:27,530 --> 04:23:39,219
Don't get out of your seat. Thank you.

3235
04:23:39,219 --> 04:23:44,200
Thank you. Yeah.

3236
04:23:44,200 --> 04:23:46,200
Hey, what about this one? You want to see some real magic?

3237
04:23:46,200 --> 04:23:51,639
Boom. What's that in my hand? Look at that.

3238
04:23:51,639 --> 04:24:01,850
Catch it. There it is. It's really heavy.

3239
04:24:01,850 --> 04:24:04,659
Who in the audience can hold it? Golden

3240
04:24:04,659 --> 04:24:11,299
Sphere. There.

3241
04:24:11,299 --> 04:24:25,899
Who wants to see a dove? You ain't going to find magic like that

3242
04:24:25,899 --> 04:24:35,879
anywhere else. Sparks.

3243
04:24:35,879 --> 04:24:43,299
Who wants this?

3244
04:24:43,299 --> 04:24:46,309
Somebody wants the hello my baby,

3245
04:24:46,309 --> 04:24:48,309
hello my honey, hello my ragtime

3246
04:24:48,309 --> 04:24:54,010
gal? You mean like the

3247
04:24:54,010 --> 04:24:56,010
hello my baby, hello my honey.

3248
04:24:56,010 --> 04:25:04,569
I can't kick that high. I'm going to

3249
04:25:04,569 --> 04:25:16,600
rip my pants. My pants are going to rip

3250
04:25:16,600 --> 04:25:18,969
in half. This is actually a nice suit.

3251
04:25:18,969 --> 04:25:25,180
Hello my baby, hello.

3252
04:25:25,180 --> 04:25:28,180
No, I'm not going to do it. I can't do it.

3253
04:25:28,180 --> 04:25:32,149
One more time. Can I

3254
04:25:32,149 --> 04:25:34,899
dub over it? I'm going to dub.

3255
04:25:34,899 --> 04:25:37,719
Here you go. Here's the dub. Just take this audio

3256
04:25:37,719 --> 04:25:41,370
and you can use it. Hello my baby,

3257
04:25:41,370 --> 04:25:43,370
hello my honey, hello my ragtime

3258
04:25:43,370 --> 04:25:45,370
gal. Send me a kiss

3259
04:25:45,370 --> 04:25:47,370
my wife. Baby, my

3260
04:25:47,370 --> 04:25:49,370
heart's on fire. And if you refuse

3261
04:25:49,370 --> 04:25:51,370
me, baby, you'll lose me. And you'll be left

3262
04:25:51,370 --> 04:25:53,370
alone. And tell me, tell me

3263
04:25:53,370 --> 04:25:55,370
that I'm your man.

3264
04:25:57,370 --> 04:26:34,149
Okay, there you go. Just dub it.

3265
04:26:34,149 --> 04:26:38,889
He's going to tear his groin. Where's Spider-Man?

3266
04:26:38,889 --> 04:26:40,889
I know, I know. Spider-Man's coming.

3267
04:26:40,889 --> 04:26:46,379
Let me get this off. Alright, actual

3268
04:26:46,379 --> 04:26:52,709
clothing change. I'll be right back.

3269
04:26:52,709 --> 04:27:47,299
What do you want? Patrick Bateman?

3270
04:27:47,299 --> 04:27:49,479
Like, dressed like this?

3271
04:27:49,479 --> 04:27:57,799
Every single day I put on a

3272
04:27:57,799 --> 04:28:03,879
mask with apricots,

3273
04:28:03,879 --> 04:28:10,010
negros, shell stocks,

3274
04:28:10,010 --> 04:28:12,569
and bonds.

3275
04:28:12,569 --> 04:28:14,569
And I chase people who change their

3276
04:28:14,569 --> 04:28:16,569
lives.

3277
04:28:16,569 --> 04:28:18,569
Your microphone's over here.

3278
04:28:20,569 --> 04:28:22,940
Oops.

3279
04:28:22,940 --> 04:28:24,940
Sorry.

3280
04:28:24,940 --> 04:28:26,940
Oh well, just use that one. Who cares?

3281
04:28:26,940 --> 04:31:56,709
Alright, changing.

3282
04:31:56,709 --> 04:31:58,709
Alright, guys, we've got a problem.

3283
04:31:58,709 --> 04:32:01,780
We've got

3284
04:32:01,780 --> 04:32:04,340
a problem. Big problem.

3285
04:32:04,340 --> 04:32:06,899
I don't, I think

3286
04:32:06,899 --> 04:32:08,899
this costume,

3287
04:32:08,899 --> 04:32:12,739
I think it's two left hands.

3288
04:32:12,739 --> 04:32:15,500
Like, can you, hold on.

3289
04:32:15,500 --> 04:32:20,659
Am I crazy?

3290
04:32:20,659 --> 04:32:24,309
Right? I'm like, I'm crazy

3291
04:32:24,309 --> 04:32:26,870
or not, right?

3292
04:32:26,870 --> 04:32:32,569
This is too, my thumb, I can't

3293
04:32:32,569 --> 04:32:35,579
put the thumb over there. What the fuck?

3294
04:32:35,579 --> 04:32:41,209
Hold on, can I like,

3295
04:32:41,209 --> 04:32:43,770
hold on, hold on.

3296
04:32:43,770 --> 04:33:45,400
Hey guys, I'm telling you.

3297
04:33:45,400 --> 04:33:47,400
Oh my god, am I

3298
04:33:47,400 --> 04:33:49,580
a good Spider-Man? Let me fucking

3299
04:33:49,580 --> 04:33:52,779
tell you. I don't know, I can't, how am I going to

3300
04:33:52,779 --> 04:33:54,779
hook this thing, how am I, nobody's going to be able to hear, okay.

3301
04:33:54,779 --> 04:33:56,779
This is going to be with no audio.

3302
04:33:56,779 --> 04:33:58,779
I'm going to have to move around as Spider-Man with no audio.

3303
04:33:58,779 --> 04:34:01,020
I can't clip this thing to anything.

3304
04:34:01,020 --> 04:34:03,020
Can it, no way.

3305
04:34:03,020 --> 04:34:05,020
Alright, I'm going to,

3306
04:34:05,020 --> 04:34:07,020
there'll be a little bit of audio, I'm going to put the microphone

3307
04:34:07,020 --> 04:34:10,729
like over here. But excuse me.

3308
04:34:10,729 --> 04:34:13,349
Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.

3309
04:34:13,349 --> 04:34:19,419
Peter Parker's here. Excuse me.

3310
04:34:19,419 --> 04:34:21,909
Peter Parker, thank you.

3311
04:34:21,909 --> 04:34:24,790
Peter Parker's here. Give me that fucking job.

3312
04:34:24,790 --> 04:34:30,790
Give me that role. Alright, let me,

3313
04:34:30,790 --> 04:34:34,569
I can't,

3314
04:34:34,569 --> 04:34:37,450
you guys are going to have to sit over here.

3315
04:34:37,450 --> 04:34:39,450
You're not going to be able to hear anything, but whatever.

3316
04:34:39,450 --> 04:34:41,750
This is just for Spider-Man anyways, so

3317
04:34:41,750 --> 04:35:27,560
whatever.

3318
04:35:27,560 --> 04:36:01,270
See you later, man.

3319
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:07,669
Green Goblin! Gotcha!

3320
04:36:07,669 --> 04:36:15,659
You know, it's not a gotcha.

3321
04:36:15,659 --> 04:36:20,759
Drugs and alcohol.

3322
04:36:20,759 --> 04:36:23,000
Hi everyone, I'm Peter Parker.

3323
04:36:23,000 --> 04:36:25,689
A.K.A. Spider-Man.

3324
04:36:25,689 --> 04:36:36,180
Can you guys even hear?

3325
04:36:36,180 --> 04:36:44,040
No.

3326
04:36:44,040 --> 04:36:46,279
MJ, everyone knows I'm Spider-Man now.

3327
04:36:46,279 --> 04:36:49,099
What am I going to do? Don't you stand

3328
04:36:49,099 --> 04:36:52,869
like they've been thinking about my identity.

3329
04:36:52,869 --> 04:36:54,869
We're going to have to go underground, we're going to have to hide for a little while.

3330
04:36:54,869 --> 04:36:57,560
Listen to me, MJ.

3331
04:36:57,560 --> 04:36:59,740
We've got to hide for a while.

3332
04:36:59,740 --> 04:37:06,840
Everyone's going to know I'm Spider-Man.

3333
04:37:06,840 --> 04:37:08,840
MJ, come on, let's go.

3334
04:37:08,840 --> 04:37:17,659
All these people,

3335
04:37:17,659 --> 04:37:27,580
they know I'm Spider-Man.

3336
04:37:27,580 --> 04:37:29,580
MJ, tell them I'm a good guy.

3337
04:37:29,580 --> 04:37:40,459
What I was thinking is,

3338
04:37:40,459 --> 04:37:43,380
what if I, what if I put a different

3339
04:37:43,380 --> 04:37:45,380
costume on, a different suit,

3340
04:37:45,380 --> 04:37:47,380
and I wasn't Spider-Man?

3341
04:37:47,380 --> 04:37:49,380
What if I was a different character, and then everyone would know

3342
04:37:49,380 --> 04:37:51,380
that I was a different superhero?

3343
04:37:51,380 --> 04:37:53,380
Doesn't that fix everything?

3344
04:37:53,380 --> 04:37:55,380
Can't I just put on a different costume?

3345
04:37:55,380 --> 04:37:57,380
Well, I don't have to be Spider-Man.

3346
04:37:57,380 --> 04:37:59,380
I can be Mothboy.

3347
04:37:59,380 --> 04:38:01,380
No one's going to know I'm Spider-Man. There's so many weird

3348
04:38:01,380 --> 04:38:03,380
fucked up people in these universes that doesn't matter.

3349
04:38:03,380 --> 04:38:06,069
They'll just think,

3350
04:38:06,069 --> 04:38:08,069
we'll just say that Spider-Man got hit by a train

3351
04:38:08,069 --> 04:38:10,069
and it exploded

3352
04:38:10,069 --> 04:38:12,069
into blood and stuff.

3353
04:38:12,069 --> 04:38:14,069
I'm Mothboy.

3354
04:38:14,069 --> 04:38:21,240
Doesn't that fix everything?

3355
04:38:32,389 --> 04:38:37,000
Well, he already did that.

3356
04:38:37,000 --> 04:38:40,779
Mothboy.

3357
04:38:40,779 --> 04:38:42,779
But you're marketable.

3358
04:38:42,779 --> 04:38:44,779
You need to address the, I'm not addressing anything.

3359
04:38:44,779 --> 04:38:48,680
Yeah, hey, address this.

3360
04:38:48,680 --> 04:38:53,659
Nevermind. Did you hear the thing where I go,

3361
04:38:53,659 --> 04:38:55,659
oh, everybody goes like this, everybody goes like this in the movie.

3362
04:38:55,659 --> 04:38:58,279
Oh yeah, whatever, okay, everyone goes like this.

3363
04:38:58,279 --> 04:39:01,159
Edit that in. Alright, let me do some more spider moves.

3364
04:39:01,159 --> 04:39:03,159
I have to confront somebody. Who am I going to confront?

3365
04:39:03,159 --> 04:39:14,790
Jigsaw.

3366
04:39:14,790 --> 04:39:17,290
Hold on.

3367
04:39:17,290 --> 04:39:47,299
I'm just going to put you there.

3368
04:39:47,299 --> 04:40:05,590
Activate. I can see everything.

3369
04:40:05,590 --> 04:40:11,099
Activate laser sight.

3370
04:40:11,099 --> 04:40:13,459
You're not going to get away, Green Goblin.

3371
04:40:13,459 --> 04:40:20,299
Wait a minute. That's not Green Goblin.

3372
04:40:20,299 --> 04:40:33,419
Who's that new man?

3373
04:40:33,419 --> 04:40:45,319
Jigsaw. I just imagined Jigsaw flying around.

3374
04:40:45,319 --> 04:40:49,459
Wait a minute. Who's that?

3375
04:40:49,459 --> 04:40:52,020
That's not the Green Goblin.

3376
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:57,659
That's someone else. Who's that?

3377
04:40:57,659 --> 04:41:09,349
A new villain.

3378
04:41:09,349 --> 04:41:11,349
You know what this is funny? This is implying that

3379
04:41:11,349 --> 04:41:13,349
Spider-Man had 40 Pornhub tabs open.

3380
04:41:13,349 --> 04:41:16,360
That's why Jigsaw

3381
04:41:16,360 --> 04:41:26,340
got him. I'm going to put the mask here.

3382
04:41:26,340 --> 04:41:28,340
I'm going to put the mask here

3383
04:41:28,340 --> 04:41:30,340
because Jigsaw got me

3384
04:41:30,340 --> 04:41:32,340
and he put my mask away

3385
04:41:32,340 --> 04:41:34,340
because everyone knows my identity.

3386
04:41:34,340 --> 04:41:36,340
Jigsaw took my mask off.

3387
04:41:36,340 --> 04:41:38,340
Because that ain't moving.

3388
04:41:38,340 --> 04:41:40,779
Is there a chair

3389
04:41:40,779 --> 04:41:43,209
I can put this on?

3390
04:41:43,209 --> 04:41:51,459
Give me the other mask too.

3391
04:42:00,950 --> 04:42:03,130
I don't know

3392
04:42:03,130 --> 04:42:05,130
where to put this.

3393
04:42:05,130 --> 04:42:10,630
Do I just hold it?

3394
04:42:10,630 --> 04:42:12,630
Maybe I could

3395
04:42:12,630 --> 04:42:15,700
set it here.

3396
04:42:15,700 --> 04:42:17,700
God.

3397
04:42:17,700 --> 04:42:19,700
Hold on.

3398
04:42:19,700 --> 04:42:21,700
I have to go this way.

3399
04:42:21,700 --> 04:42:23,700
Everybody don't look.

3400
04:42:23,700 --> 04:42:28,500
Nobody look.

3401
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:30,500
Sitting down is like no fucking way.

3402
04:42:37,419 --> 04:43:21,939
Where am I? What's going on here?

3403
04:43:21,939 --> 04:43:30,840
Do you have an idea who you're dealing with?

3404
04:43:30,840 --> 04:43:40,740
I'm Spider-Man.

3405
04:43:40,740 --> 04:43:57,560
Well don't...

3406
04:43:57,560 --> 04:44:00,119
Usually I thought I cleared all that.

3407
04:44:00,119 --> 04:44:02,979
So what do I do? One minute?

3408
04:44:02,979 --> 04:44:05,860
One minute? Okay.

3409
04:44:05,860 --> 04:44:08,169
I got one minute on a clock. I can do this.

3410
04:44:08,169 --> 04:44:10,169
All these computers here?

3411
04:44:10,169 --> 04:44:12,169
Okay.

3412
04:44:12,169 --> 04:44:19,080
The clock is going on now.

3413
04:44:19,080 --> 04:44:21,080
Which one? Which one do I start with? First this one over here.

3414
04:44:21,080 --> 04:44:25,500
I'm going to hack into that.

3415
04:44:25,500 --> 04:44:29,139
I hacked it.

3416
04:44:29,139 --> 04:44:34,900
This one too. Got it. Got it. Got it.

3417
04:44:34,900 --> 04:44:36,900
There's only a few more.

3418
04:44:36,900 --> 04:44:43,180
Now that's thinking with webs.

3419
04:44:43,180 --> 04:44:45,930
I did what you wanted. I shut them all off.

3420
04:44:45,930 --> 04:44:54,040
What?

3421
04:44:54,040 --> 04:44:59,099
I did it? I won?

3422
04:44:59,099 --> 04:45:01,099
Okay.

3423
04:45:01,099 --> 04:45:11,270
I can't move the mask when I'm sitting down.

3424
04:45:11,270 --> 04:45:15,299
Don't you get it?

3425
04:45:15,299 --> 04:45:21,900
You look like an old man.

3426
04:45:21,900 --> 04:45:23,900
Hunching.

3427
04:45:23,900 --> 04:45:26,900
Hunching over.

3428
04:45:26,900 --> 04:45:30,229
That's so fucking stupid.

3429
04:45:30,229 --> 04:45:34,650
I love this

3430
04:45:34,650 --> 04:45:36,650
bizarre

3431
04:45:36,650 --> 04:45:39,080
fucked up shit.

3432
04:45:39,080 --> 04:45:41,080
Because everybody says there's no way it's going to get used

3433
04:45:41,080 --> 04:45:43,259
anywhere.

3434
04:45:43,259 --> 04:45:45,259
But it always does.

3435
04:45:45,259 --> 04:45:47,259
And somebody creatively uses this shit

3436
04:45:47,259 --> 04:45:49,259
and makes an insane video.

3437
04:45:49,259 --> 04:45:52,900
I can't fucking wait.

3438
04:45:52,900 --> 04:45:56,810
Twerk as Spider-Man?

3439
04:45:56,810 --> 04:45:58,810
It always works.

3440
04:45:58,810 --> 04:46:03,799
You guys are too creative.

3441
04:46:03,799 --> 04:46:06,169
Let me do some more stuff with Spider-Man.

3442
04:46:06,169 --> 04:46:09,819
Just like moving around and stuff.

3443
04:46:09,819 --> 04:46:12,119
When do I get to wear one of these?

3444
04:46:12,119 --> 04:46:14,119
When I stand up it's fine.

3445
04:46:14,119 --> 04:46:32,790
You don't need audio for this.

3446
04:46:32,790 --> 04:46:56,599
Can I see the lightsaber?

3447
04:46:56,599 --> 04:46:58,599
Those crazy Spider-Man Elsa videos.

3448
04:46:58,599 --> 04:47:00,599
You know what I mean?

3449
04:47:00,599 --> 04:47:02,599
Spider-Man with a lightsaber is like

3450
04:47:02,599 --> 04:47:04,599
coming around while he eats my hamburger buns.

3451
04:47:04,599 --> 04:47:13,689
This new technology

3452
04:47:13,689 --> 04:47:15,689
that Tony Stark made for me

3453
04:47:15,689 --> 04:47:27,340
sure is cool.

3454
04:47:27,340 --> 04:47:29,340
I'm here representing the Avengers.

3455
04:47:29,340 --> 04:48:09,849
Oh, you gotta get me doing that.

3456
04:48:11,849 --> 04:48:28,020
Bang! Bang!

3457
04:48:28,020 --> 04:48:30,020
This new technology that Tony Stark made

3458
04:48:30,020 --> 04:48:33,740
sure is interesting.

3459
04:48:33,740 --> 04:48:35,740
I wonder what I would call this.

3460
04:48:35,740 --> 04:48:37,740
An electric sword.

3461
04:49:39,419 --> 04:49:43,770
Who needs webs?

3462
04:49:43,770 --> 04:49:54,069
Start to cry?

3463
04:49:54,069 --> 04:50:00,919
It looks like you shit your pants.

3464
04:50:00,919 --> 04:50:04,819
Jeremy, you're gonna drop dead.

3465
04:50:04,819 --> 04:50:07,060
I'm alright.

3466
04:50:07,060 --> 04:50:09,060
I'm kind of at the end here.

3467
04:50:09,060 --> 04:50:14,060
Oh, do a superhero landing, yep.

3468
04:50:14,060 --> 04:50:28,250
Am I late?

3469
04:50:28,250 --> 04:50:41,290
Sorry I kept you all waiting.

3470
04:50:41,290 --> 04:50:43,290
You gotta cut out me laughing too.

3471
04:50:43,290 --> 04:50:46,680
It's too stupid.

3472
04:50:46,680 --> 04:50:51,979
Can I wrap this around?

3473
04:50:51,979 --> 04:50:54,540
I have a solution.

3474
04:50:54,540 --> 04:51:14,310
Where's the other hood?

3475
04:51:14,310 --> 04:51:34,840
It's time to fight some crime.

3476
04:51:34,840 --> 04:51:37,849
I need some adjustments to my suit.

3477
04:51:37,849 --> 04:51:42,970
I feel like it's a little more appropriate.

3478
04:51:42,970 --> 04:52:06,250
Let's go!

3479
04:52:06,250 --> 04:52:13,540
I hope this is okay.

3480
04:52:13,540 --> 04:52:15,540
He deserved it.

3481
04:52:15,540 --> 04:52:19,430
Why did it explode?

3482
04:52:19,430 --> 04:52:23,659
Why did it explode?

3483
04:52:23,659 --> 04:52:25,659
It fell four or five inches.

3484
04:52:25,659 --> 04:52:30,259
No, I'm taller than that.

3485
04:52:30,259 --> 04:52:32,259
Alright, I think it's like

3486
04:52:32,259 --> 04:52:34,259
I don't even know where this came from.

3487
04:52:34,259 --> 04:52:39,259
Whatever, it's fine.

3488
04:52:39,259 --> 04:52:41,259
Alright, what else can I do

3489
04:52:41,259 --> 04:52:43,259
in the next ten minutes?

3490
04:52:43,259 --> 04:52:45,259
Baseball Spider-Man?

3491
04:52:48,840 --> 04:52:50,840
Oh, I kind of did with the car thing.

3492
04:52:55,130 --> 04:53:00,119
This is so fun.

3493
04:53:00,119 --> 04:53:03,130
I'm so happy to do this again.

3494
04:53:03,130 --> 04:53:05,130
It really is so fucking fun.

3495
04:53:05,130 --> 04:53:11,659
What do you guys think?

3496
04:53:11,659 --> 04:53:13,659
Out of all the three times that I've done this

3497
04:53:13,659 --> 04:53:17,750
do you think you got enough to do some stuff?

3498
04:53:17,750 --> 04:53:24,150
Another ten minutes of stuff?

3499
04:53:24,150 --> 04:53:26,150
Because remember, you can use all footage

3500
04:53:26,150 --> 04:53:28,150
from every single time.

3501
04:53:28,150 --> 04:53:31,740
It's not just this one.

3502
04:53:31,740 --> 04:53:40,819
What other separate streams you can pull from now?

3503
04:53:40,819 --> 04:53:46,709
Do Patrick Bateman?

3504
04:53:46,709 --> 04:53:53,500
Do some more dancing.

3505
04:53:53,500 --> 04:54:03,029
You need to do more Star Wars.

3506
04:54:03,029 --> 04:54:05,659
Virtual ASMR murder.

3507
04:54:05,659 --> 04:54:15,319
I already did that though.

3508
04:54:15,319 --> 04:54:22,549
Alright, let me get a few more things out of the way.

3509
04:54:22,549 --> 04:54:25,240
What are some more things?

3510
04:54:25,240 --> 04:54:27,419
Honestly, you know what I'm looking forward to more than anything?

3511
04:54:27,419 --> 04:54:29,419
All the Super Mario shit.

3512
04:54:29,419 --> 04:54:31,419
Honest to God, I feel like the Mario stuff

3513
04:54:31,419 --> 04:54:34,099
combined with a few other things

3514
04:54:34,099 --> 04:54:36,099
could be gold.

3515
04:54:36,099 --> 04:54:44,860
I'm just telling you.

3516
04:54:44,860 --> 04:54:46,860
Yeah, there's a lot of other stuff to do.

3517
04:54:46,860 --> 04:54:49,159
I think we've got probably half the list.

3518
04:54:49,159 --> 04:54:58,040
Maybe a little bit less than half.

3519
04:54:58,040 --> 04:55:00,040
There were, what, six or seven

3520
04:55:00,040 --> 04:55:02,040
hundred suggestions.

3521
04:55:02,040 --> 04:55:04,040
This has taken down to like two hundred.

3522
04:55:04,040 --> 04:55:07,689
We did probably like fifty in five hours.

3523
04:55:07,689 --> 04:55:10,889
Do a bong rip?

3524
04:55:10,889 --> 04:55:14,340
I'll do a bong rip. Do the walk?

3525
04:55:14,340 --> 04:55:19,400
I'll do the walk with Spider-Man.

3526
04:55:19,400 --> 04:55:21,400
Oh, the pointing meme, right?

3527
04:55:21,400 --> 04:55:23,400
I'll do the pointing meme.

3528
04:55:23,400 --> 04:55:25,700
I'll do the walk.

3529
04:55:25,700 --> 04:55:27,700
I want to do a couple more things with Spider-Man.

3530
04:55:27,700 --> 04:55:31,159
I'll do some Spider-Man stuff.

3531
04:55:31,159 --> 04:55:33,159
Alright, you're not going to be able to hear me very well,

3532
04:55:33,159 --> 04:57:44,470
but I'm going over here.

3533
04:57:44,470 --> 04:57:46,470
He's going to puke?

3534
04:57:46,470 --> 04:57:55,430
No, I don't want to do it right into that.

3535
04:57:55,430 --> 04:58:21,459
It matches.

3536
04:58:21,459 --> 04:58:30,040
I don't know why I'm Spider-Man while I do that, but it's fine.

3537
04:58:30,040 --> 04:58:32,040
The hair. Do a bong rip?

3538
04:58:32,040 --> 04:58:38,819
Alright, fine. Here's your bong rip.

3539
04:58:38,819 --> 04:58:42,220
Do we have a bong? Yeah, I'll just pretend it's this.

3540
04:58:42,220 --> 04:59:34,409
You know, hold this.

3541
04:59:34,409 --> 04:59:42,020
So bad. You fucking...

3542
04:59:42,020 --> 04:59:44,020
He doesn't have to do the drug PSA.

3543
04:59:44,020 --> 04:59:51,380
Oh, the drug PSA.

3544
04:59:51,380 --> 04:59:56,759
Okay, what's the Miku dance?

3545
04:59:56,759 --> 05:00:03,029
The act out?

3546
05:00:03,029 --> 05:00:05,029
The death from the Thanos snap?

3547
05:00:05,029 --> 05:00:08,409
Oh.

3548
05:00:08,409 --> 05:00:10,779
That's sad though.

3549
05:00:10,779 --> 05:00:13,659
What does he do? Alright, I'll do it for you.

3550
05:00:13,659 --> 05:00:16,599
He's like lying down and he goes...

3551
05:00:16,599 --> 05:00:18,599
He just says, I don't feel so good.

3552
05:00:18,599 --> 05:00:25,000
He goes...

3553
05:00:25,000 --> 05:00:29,220
I don't know.

3554
05:00:29,220 --> 05:00:32,040
Mr. Stark,

3555
05:00:32,040 --> 05:00:34,470
I don't feel so good.

3556
05:00:34,470 --> 05:01:01,080
I'm still here.

3557
05:01:01,080 --> 05:01:05,159
Whoa.

3558
05:01:05,159 --> 05:01:08,040
Well, I'm still here.

3559
05:01:08,040 --> 05:01:15,080
Mr. Stark, I'm still here.

3560
05:01:15,080 --> 05:01:23,000
No, no.

3561
05:01:23,000 --> 05:01:25,000
Mr. Stark, what? Mr. Stark, what is this thing?

3562
05:01:25,000 --> 05:01:27,819
Mr. Stark, what's this little thing, Mr. Stark?

3563
05:01:27,819 --> 05:01:39,900
Why am I holding this, Mr. Stark?

3564
05:01:39,900 --> 05:01:41,900
Let me see what this is. I can't even shout the company out because

3565
05:01:41,900 --> 05:01:43,900
it's not focused.

3566
05:01:43,900 --> 05:01:54,060
Here, can you see?

3567
05:01:54,060 --> 05:01:56,060
This is Road Wireless Goes.

3568
05:01:56,060 --> 05:01:59,259
These things are fucking awesome.

3569
05:01:59,259 --> 05:02:02,840
These things saved the stream, by the way.

3570
05:02:02,840 --> 05:02:06,740
This is not sponsored.

3571
05:02:06,740 --> 05:02:08,740
I literally bought these

3572
05:02:08,740 --> 05:02:12,330
about, like, hours ago. These things are fucking awesome.

3573
05:02:12,330 --> 05:02:15,270
They're so little.

3574
05:02:15,270 --> 05:02:18,139
They can do anything.

3575
05:02:18,139 --> 05:02:22,680
Alright, one more thing and I'm going to clean up.

3576
05:02:22,680 --> 05:02:25,180
Road. It's the Road Wireless Microphones.

3577
05:02:25,180 --> 05:02:28,380
They're fucking awesome.

3578
05:02:28,380 --> 05:02:32,020
You get two.

3579
05:02:32,020 --> 05:02:34,020
It's been five hours, six hours. These things are still going.

3580
05:02:34,020 --> 05:02:37,349
This one's still going.

3581
05:02:37,349 --> 05:02:40,810
R-O-D-E. You can plug other shit into here, too.

3582
05:02:40,810 --> 05:02:45,849
Yeah, it's still...

3583
05:02:45,849 --> 05:02:47,849
Alright, guys.

3584
05:02:47,849 --> 05:02:49,849
We got to clean up. We have a hard exit here.

3585
05:02:49,849 --> 05:02:53,110
There's a hard stop here

3586
05:02:53,110 --> 05:02:55,479
in the next 40 minutes and we got to clean up.

3587
05:02:55,479 --> 05:02:58,919
We got through a lot.

3588
05:02:58,919 --> 05:03:00,919
There was a lot of shit to go through today.

3589
05:03:00,919 --> 05:03:05,000
So, the next time I stream

3590
05:03:05,000 --> 05:03:07,000
I will give you some really clear rules

3591
05:03:07,000 --> 05:03:09,180
because I can't really give them to you now

3592
05:03:09,180 --> 05:03:15,259
because we got to clean up.

3593
05:03:15,259 --> 05:03:17,430
Are you going to do a day two? Probably not.

3594
05:03:17,430 --> 05:03:28,040
Not soon.

3595
05:03:28,040 --> 05:03:32,650
I feel like there's a lot of

3596
05:03:32,650 --> 05:03:35,529
supplemental weird shit.

3597
05:03:35,529 --> 05:03:37,529
Yes, you're going to be able to use all three of the streams

3598
05:03:37,529 --> 05:03:40,340
and on top of that, you're also...

3599
05:03:40,340 --> 05:03:42,340
In the Discord

3600
05:03:42,340 --> 05:03:44,650
it will put some rules out.

3601
05:03:44,650 --> 05:03:46,819
We're going to have to be...

3602
05:03:46,819 --> 05:03:49,319
Let me just say this.

3603
05:03:49,319 --> 05:03:51,819
We're going to have to be insanely selective this time

3604
05:03:51,819 --> 05:03:53,819
because there's no way we're going to be able to get through the videos

3605
05:03:53,819 --> 05:03:55,819
that people are going to submit.

3606
05:03:55,819 --> 05:03:58,380
So, there's going to be... I really hate to say this

3607
05:03:58,380 --> 05:04:00,869
but there's going to be a really heavy, heavy

3608
05:04:00,869 --> 05:04:03,369
content quality filter.

3609
05:04:03,369 --> 05:04:05,669
Otherwise, it would just be dozens

3610
05:04:05,669 --> 05:04:07,669
and dozens and dozens of hours of videos

3611
05:04:07,669 --> 05:04:10,340
that we would never get through, ever.

3612
05:04:10,340 --> 05:04:12,340
So, we're going to have a pretty strict quality bar

3613
05:04:12,340 --> 05:04:14,340
that

3614
05:04:14,340 --> 05:04:17,099
is going to have to get met.

3615
05:04:17,099 --> 05:04:19,099
But that doesn't mean that funny, jokey, short

3616
05:04:19,099 --> 05:04:21,459
meme stuff won't get through.

3617
05:04:21,459 --> 05:04:23,459
It's just that we're going to have to make a lot of hard decisions on

3618
05:04:23,459 --> 05:04:25,459
what can actually show on stream.

3619
05:04:25,459 --> 05:04:27,459
Because even if I do an encore night, if we do a four to hour,

3620
05:04:27,459 --> 05:04:29,459
five hour, six hour stream

3621
05:04:29,459 --> 05:04:31,459
and do another six, seven hour stream

3622
05:04:31,459 --> 05:04:34,340
encore for these videos

3623
05:04:34,340 --> 05:04:36,340
we probably wouldn't even get through a tenth of them.

3624
05:04:36,340 --> 05:04:38,340
So, I've got to try to get

3625
05:04:38,340 --> 05:04:40,340
at least a quality bar

3626
05:04:40,340 --> 05:04:44,700
that's going to have to get passed.

3627
05:04:44,700 --> 05:04:46,700
And it will be in a playlist. The playlist will be available

3628
05:04:46,700 --> 05:04:51,500
a few times we've done it.

3629
05:04:51,500 --> 05:04:54,549
But yeah, I hope you guys had fun. I did.

3630
05:04:54,549 --> 05:04:57,430
I'm very tired though.

3631
05:04:57,430 --> 05:04:59,799
I forget how fun it is just to kind of be a

3632
05:04:59,799 --> 05:05:01,799
wacko and do all this.

3633
05:05:01,799 --> 05:05:03,799
So, hope it was entertaining.

3634
05:05:03,799 --> 05:05:06,549
I hope you can get some footage out of this

3635
05:05:06,549 --> 05:05:10,250
and combine it with the other two streams.

3636
05:05:10,250 --> 05:05:12,250
We'll see. Thank you so much for watching.

3637
05:05:12,250 --> 05:05:14,250
I'll see you guys later. The next stream will be

3638
05:05:14,250 --> 05:05:18,470
what's today? Today is the 30th.

3639
05:05:18,470 --> 05:05:21,740
Okay, so

3640
05:05:21,740 --> 05:05:25,240
maybe I'll be back on Sunday. Sunday the 3rd.

3641
05:05:25,240 --> 05:05:27,930
Oh, we're going to play Cuphead. Cuphead's DLC

3642
05:05:27,930 --> 05:05:29,930
Well, that's what I'm doing next. I'm going to stream Cuphead.

3643
05:05:29,930 --> 05:05:31,930
We're going to beat the DLC. Maybe in one day

3644
05:05:31,930 --> 05:05:34,360
I'll do two or three days, however long it takes.

3645
05:05:34,360 --> 05:05:37,560
Cuphead DLC coming soon.

3646
05:05:37,560 --> 05:05:39,560
I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching.

3647
05:05:39,560 --> 05:05:41,560
Also, thanks to Holly. Holly, doing this by myself

3648
05:05:41,560 --> 05:05:43,560
the last few years was fucking unbelievably

3649
05:05:43,560 --> 05:05:46,819
hard. So, yeah. She did

3650
05:05:46,819 --> 05:05:48,819
a lot of help here. Just helping with props

3651
05:05:48,819 --> 05:05:50,819
and costumes and compiling stuff.

3652
05:05:50,819 --> 05:05:52,819
So, that was a big help. So, it was a lot of fun.

3653
05:05:52,819 --> 05:05:54,819
Thanks everyone.

3654
05:05:54,819 --> 05:05:56,819
I'll see you guys on

3655
05:05:56,819 --> 05:05:58,819
Sunday. Good night.

3656
05:05:58,819 --> 05:06:00,819
Goodbye. Take care, guys.

3657
05:06:00,819 --> 05:06:02,819
Call your mother. You know the deal.

3658
05:06:02,819 --> 05:06:05,000
See you later.
