00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:11,019
Hi. Hi. Hi. I got, I got, we get bunched up underwear.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:22,949
Is it weird that I wanted to go get bicycle shorts for these VR streams? Just wear them?

3
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:31,699
Not, no, no, no, not just, but I'm talking underneath my pants. Is that not weird? Okay, good.

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,509
All right, for a second I thought this pair of underwear had pockets.

5
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,840
And I'm sitting here thinking, wait a minute, holy shit, what a brilliant idea.

6
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,340
Imagine underwear with pockets. It would be sick. You'd never have to wear a pair of pants in your

7
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,799
house ever again. You just put on underwear and have like, you know, there's the right pockets,

8
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:05,500
got your chapstick in it, your left, got your keys in your left pocket. I think there's something

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:17,379
there. Why would you want, why would you want, what? What about your hair? You just take your

10
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:23,219
pants off to access them. No, you don't. You just reach down in there and like go in your underwear

11
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,109
pocket and pull it out. It's like a secret chapstick. How's the hair? You'll see it in just

12
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:49,269
about two seconds. You tell me. Looks okay, right? It looks all right. Doesn't it? You know what I

13
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:56,810
did? I'll tell you. This camera's not in a good place. It's hard for me to show you. Uh, hey,

14
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,870
by the way, if you didn't know, Twitch partner, I have so many of these. There's no other time

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:12,539
to wear them. This t-shirt I think has been in a closet since the last time it was on there,

16
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:20,710
on video. I have, don't tell them what. It's that, no, it's not the same shirt because this

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:31,340
one says Gerber985 on it. It's number 17. You know, I picked 17 because that was the,

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,740
that was the age when I knew I wanted to be a Twitch streamer. Yeah, that's where it all,

19
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:46,629
that's where it all started. Except every person with this jersey has the number 17 on it. Every

20
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:55,860
single one of these made. They did, that was all too, that was way too much work. They're all 17.

21
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,219
Anyways, give me one second. I want to grab a water and we'll get started.

22
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,180
No, no, no. Why am I doing this? Back to the intro, back to the intro. Okay. I'm,

23
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,740
let me grab a water and we'll get started. Just what, it's VR, man. You know how fucking hard it

24
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,139
is to VR? Why did somebody just say cringe? Don't call me a cringe. I'll be right back. I was going

25
00:03:16,139 --> 00:04:02,550
to get a water. You want me to die? See, we, we hadn't even started. Oh, I didn't, I forgot to

26
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,180
even tell you. No, it's not a late stream. We were supposed to start it too. I, this, I had,

27
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:23,589
the suss was wrong. So my hands look like a bony. How do I feel like I have like these big bony

28
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:34,839
hands? Anyways, so here's what I did to my hair for all you wondered. This is quarter cup of olive

29
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:42,339
oil. You know, okay. I, I have to go down here. I have no chair. Standing and leaning down like

30
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:49,459
that is killing me. It's a, it's a quarter cup of olive oil and like eight drops of tea tree oil.

31
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:58,779
And you just go like this with your finger and then you don't do that by the way. And then you

32
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:04,579
put it in your hair. You get it in there. You get it in the problem areas. And it, my hair feels so

33
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:12,420
good right now. I can't wait to do that later. Look at the link. Don't forget the link. Salad

34
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:29,819
dressing hair. This is what your diet does to you. Hold on. I'm going to put this on camera.

35
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:46,100
Uh, this is, this is per, hold on. Let me get it on here first. Uh, this is, this is not a person.

36
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,220
This is an ant. This is an ant sized ant. No, this is a human sized ant that has, they're,

37
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,259
they're hiding. What the fuck? I don't know. You know what I was trying to say.

38
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,810
It does, it kind of looks like that. All right. It's, it is a human sized ant that's hiding in

39
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:16,360
society. This, that's an ant belly shoplifting a beach ball. You know, I was going to get,

40
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,089
I was actually going to get for like today or tomorrow, one of those, uh, like,

41
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,620
like pregnancy bumps. You know how you can get those pregnancy bumps at like, like 12 weeks or

42
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,060
something, just so you could see what your clothes look like. I was going to get one of those and

43
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,500
just wear it and just not say anything about it. And people think I'm just getting, it's getting

44
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,709
worse. This really is porn week. No, I'm talking about like to make it look like my stomach is

45
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:56,180
bigger, not to pretend that I'm pregnant. Like, yeah. There he is. Why? I'm not pretending to be,

46
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,410
I'm pretending to be a fat guy because I'm getting fatter. And it's because I've been

47
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,009
eating a lot of food. I've been feeling all right. I gained like 20 pounds. It's the green screen

48
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:18,259
stream. MPEG. You got Olive Garden hair. That's good. Because when you're here, you're family.

49
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:33,610
You're my family. None of you are my family. Not one of you. Am I really getting upside down colon

50
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:41,750
faces? None of you are my family. I'm not related to anybody in this chat. Maybe my mother.

51
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:55,800
Isn't that what that means? I don't think I'm related to anybody here. That's what I like to

52
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,040
see in the mirror. But anyways, all right, let's go. We're going to play Half Life Alex. We're

53
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,199
going to continue. My hair is going to be bad. It's going to be awful, but it's okay. I've got

54
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:13,160
my tea tree olive oil treatment in the bathtub waiting for me in about five hours. It's right

55
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:26,889
here. Five hour stream. I don't know. You missed the link. No, I didn't. That is, that was the

56
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:37,639
link. All right. You got to get your links out of the way now because there ain't no chance in

57
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:54,620
hell I'm stopping to do this. What the fuck, dude? That's shaving cream. Okay. Weed, Tovleft, Coke,

58
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:10,950
Ecstasy, Shrooms, Alcohol, Meth, PCP, and Xanax. I don't know. All right. The weed one is kind of

59
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:22,580
funny. I don't understand the PCP one. Why am I so red? Why did you make me wicked red? Do you get

60
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,460
wicked red when you get on PCP? I don't know. I've never done it before. I don't do any of these

61
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:42,250
drugs, but hold on a second. Is that actually true? I don't do that though. I don't. All right. We're

62
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:57,690
going to move on. All right. Let's go. You drink so much. The last time I drank alcohol was like

63
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:10,009
six months ago. You drink so much. Oh, by the way, I put the new, uh, yes, Stalin, Stalin. Yes,

64
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:18,090
I am. I am Stalin. I put a new face mask on here. This is new. This is a new face mask. This is not

65
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:25,049
the old one. The other one was the wide peepo happy and this one is the narrow peepo happy.

66
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:40,309
This is for the narrow face. Hopefully this doesn't hurt. No more coal miner. I don't know.

67
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:48,220
This is new and I might get the, uh, I might get the coal ring. Enable peepo happy. You say it. I

68
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,490
just said it. Just because I say it doesn't mean I have to enable it. This is actually really

69
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,690
comfortable. All right. Let me, hold on. Give me a minute. Why wouldn't there be like a hair

70
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,769
place for your hair to go? You know what I mean? Why not just have like a big hole here that this

71
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,220
hair can slide through? I mean, I would look like fucking Abe from Abe's Odyssey, but do I care? My

72
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:23,990
hair won't get all damaged. Can you guys hear this? Now you can hear this. Just shave your head. I'm

73
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:32,759
not shaving my head. I like my hair. My hair's fine. You can't gauge how somebody's hair looks

74
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,960
after a VR helmet. That's not, that's not fair. Although sometimes I think about being bald and

75
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,519
I'm like, damn, like it must be so easy just to not have to worry about it. Do you even wash your

76
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:50,440
head? Okay. Bald guys in the chat. Do you use shampoo on your bald head or do you use body wash?

77
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:11,529
Which one? Do you use both? Oh, okay. Left ear. All right. I'm going in. I'm going in. Mr. Ant

78
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:18,730
stomach. All right. So I got a shotgun. I got a pistol. I got some resin. Oh yeah. I just got

79
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,769
the laser sight, didn't I? All right. Let's go. Half Life Alex part two. Getting really hyped up

80
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:37,539
for this one. All right. I'm in. I'm in and I'm immersed and I'm ready to experience the virtual

81
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,659
world. It's hard to say words when you have ears and blocking ears. It's hard for me to talk when

82
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,100
there's things in my ears because I can't hear myself talk. So therefore I can't really talk that

83
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:54,600
well. You guys get that, right? It's hard for me to talk unless I can hear myself and I can't hear

84
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:08,019
myself really at all. So that's why I'm talking louder. Yeah. It's hard for me to talk when I have

85
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:17,990
ears. All right. Let's go. It's going to be scary. It's going to be fun. Oh, remember the piano. I

86
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,980
forget. How do you move? Oh yeah. That's right. Oh shit. I forgot about this. I forgot this game

87
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:44,820
is good. Oh, I forgot. I forgot we're playing a good game. I see it already. Okay. I have a,

88
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:52,019
I have a, I've got a little homework for you guys. Go find a channel, a stream. Doesn't matter if

89
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,379
it's a YouTuber, a streamer, a Twitter guy. Find somebody that's played through this game and didn't

90
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:08,700
come up here and do this. You find me a channel that ignored the piano. I don't think it's possible.

91
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,940
All right. Let's go. Oh wait. You found somebody that actually ignored the piano.

92
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:24,659
I'm getting resistance back here. What, what's going on? What's going on here? What is this?

93
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:36,409
I'm putting on like another person's skeleton every time I get into VR. All right. Let's go.

94
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:54,649
I still got it. I still got it. I still got it. Let's try the other hand. All right. Let's go.

95
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:15,110
Oh shit. How do I, how do I do the thing? I've been awake. Please only. Yeah. Breaker boxes.

96
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:32,889
Let's go back to the elevator plan. Breaker boxes. Bingo. Oh, they move now. That's annoying.

97
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,220
He's on goal. The CBD is kicking it. I would never be high in this thing. Are you fucking

98
00:15:44,220 --> 00:16:04,090
kidding me? You got to be shitting me, dude. I on VR. No, there's no way. Well, I have, this is,

99
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:11,139
I have a grenade. What do I do with this grenade? I do with it. It didn't reset.

100
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:24,730
It really wants me to take this. What does it want me to do with it? Reset in there.

101
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:39,690
What was that? Game's a little quiet. Hold on. Fix that. Where are you?

102
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:52,279
There's a game a little bit quiet. I'll take care of it. Got you. Where's the mouse? Come on.

103
00:16:52,279 --> 00:17:05,660
Come on. Where's the mouse? Got you. Okay. What happened to my grenade? All right. I need that

104
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:19,940
thing. The power supply. A lot of resonant here. Jesus. Power supply. I got it. Why is this? This

105
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,019
is the most lazy here. They just put like 10 residents in this room. You don't have to look

106
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:44,299
for it. Cool. Thank you. Okay. It's something I wanted to play with this. I knew you could play

107
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,859
with this. This is a better bartender simulator than the bartender game we were playing last night.

108
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:19,579
Never mind. Really? Oh. Take it. Come on here. Do it. Here we go. Elevator main power is not...

109
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:26,259
Ooh. Now I can see. I can see what the hell we're doing. Take this room. Look at the actual bottles

110
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:43,480
of liquid. Come on. Not touch this. You wouldn't want to put your hand in here. Okay. To the

111
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:53,460
elevator. What's going on here? What's going on here? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

112
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:10,299
Going. Okay. Where? Where's that going? Hey. Nothing even in these boxes. What are they doing here?

113
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:32,970
I hear somebody moving behind me. Why? Ah. Ah, damn it. Is that... Hey, nice cable management,

114
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:44,869
dickhead. This is a big one. Dude, this is a fucking huge one. What the hell?

115
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,720
This hotel's engine. The wiring's going to be a real rat sniffed.

116
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:59,369
Oh. Let's check the elevator. Let's check the elevator. I forget how you activate a grenade.

117
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:07,779
I don't remember. I don't remember how to do that.

118
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:21,740
Look at the bottle. Look at the bottle. Top button. Okay. Oh, look at the bottles in a second.

119
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:27,240
All right. We don't need the lamp. Where the fuck is this? I'm not tall enough for this.

120
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,000
This is like trying to reach the top cupboard in your house. If you're under six feet tall,

121
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,799
you know what I'm talking about. Just all of your top cabinets have nothing in them.

122
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,400
They just don't have anything in them because why would you put it there? You need steps to

123
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:50,359
be able to get them. Anyone under six feet gets it. Just leave that thing on the ground.

124
00:20:51,079 --> 00:21:17,619
Where is this going? Get over here. Right there. I can see it. I can't turn it. Why not?

125
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:41,160
Why is this right there? Move this painting. Oh. Okay. Actual like hidden electricity safe. Okay.

126
00:21:45,400 --> 00:22:10,789
I wasn't... Power back on. It looks like we're taking the ladder. Bottles. Bottles. Somebody

127
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:24,470
said look at the... Don't let me forget that. What do the bottles say? Three eighths. NBB.

128
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,660
Why do I have to read these? Is that the wrong language selected?

129
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:59,980
Liquid physics. I feel like I'm going to hit something. All right. So why do you want me

130
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,799
to read that? I don't understand. They're all in like Russian. I can't read these.

131
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,650
I don't get it. Is there a joke I'm missing or something? What am I hitting?

132
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,769
Don't read them. Liquid physics and refractions. Oh. Okay. Okay. What is this? 2008?

133
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,930
Why do I care about liquid moving liquid like water in a water level and like the light

134
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:51,539
bouncing off the door? Enter your... What the fuck happened? Did it... Why is everything crashing?

135
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:04,099
Stream VR desktop game theater? What is this? What? Did that save it?

136
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:18,230
Got VAC banned. I did not get VAC banned. I think my SteamVR just crashed. Fucking motorcycle game.

137
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,680
That motorcycle game has cursed. It's not even the... All right. It's not even the motorcycle

138
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,500
game. I gave that game a lot of shit for no reason. Okay. But you guys can't even see anything.

139
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:44,380
Let's just go back in and see what happens. Is my Steam even... I don't even have Steam anymore.

140
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:54,259
God damn it. All right. Hold on. I might actually have to restart my computer.

141
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:10,230
It's supposed to be a triple A, triple H Steam game. No. Not again. We were just playing, man.

142
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:22,410
Hold on. Let me see if I have to do this or not. Okay. Open it up.

143
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:30,920
Half-life Alex. All right. Please tell me I don't have to redo this.

144
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:41,240
What the fuck is this doing? Why is it opening up a game theater for this toolkit now?

145
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,339
It's just showing like everything on my desktop. This is fucking bizarre.

146
00:25:47,339 --> 00:26:05,259
All this shit is so fucked up. All right. Let me open this. Did that take it over or is that good?

147
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:17,210
Stupid motor... Say you like the liquid physics. I mean, they're cool. What do you want me to say?

148
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:29,109
Dude, I have no picture at all. There we go. Hold on. All right. They're cool. Fine. Is that what

149
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:38,309
you want? All right. I got the game back, but what the fuck happened to my like actual my toolkit,

150
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:46,920
my OVR toolkit? It just exploded and I can't even open it anymore. I need a break. Hold on. Sorry.

151
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:52,619
This is like just a bizarre issue that I've never seen before. We're getting just bizarre problems

152
00:26:52,619 --> 00:27:02,950
that just didn't... For no reason, they happened two days in a row. Okay. So anytime I open up

153
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:09,289
OVR toolkit, it takes over everything, deletes the game I'm playing, and goes into like this

154
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:14,740
desktop game theater. This is something that's... I have no... I'm gonna have to play the game without

155
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:24,519
chat. This is fucking nuts. Like why is SteamVR desktop game theater opening when I put on like

156
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:33,019
the chat window thing? Try killing the task for it. The fucking stream is going to turn off,

157
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:43,960
guarantee it. No, there's nothing there. Hold on. God damn it. Why? It's two days in a row.

158
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,279
Why can't this shit just work? Sit down at your pilot station and get rid of this

159
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:59,450
play VR with chat. I'm gonna restart SteamVR. I got a fresh install of windows.

160
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:15,369
It's been cleaned and wiped. Let's try this. Get a better computer. Yeah, I would,

161
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:22,019
but there's no computer parts exist. I'm gonna get a brand new computer. There are no 3080s,

162
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,740
no 3090s, no 3070s, no new CPUs. Everything's gone. There's no RAM.

163
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:42,069
Yeah, I could get like reliably a fucking case and just put paper in it and pretend there's a

164
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:49,660
computer in there. Get a 2080. No, that's old technology. Okay, let me try this again. If not,

165
00:28:49,660 --> 00:29:02,279
I'm just gonna have to play without chat. That sucks, but whatever. Come on, come on, come on,

166
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:08,279
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh baby, I think we're good to go. Finally,

167
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:15,099
computers. Please tell me this is fine after I just rebooted Steam like three times.

168
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,440
It's so stupid. I didn't do anything. I just, yeah, sorry, guys. I have a 1080.

169
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,420
Roast me. Wait, you have a 1080? You're not allowed to play video games. Go buy another

170
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:45,509
$4,000 computer. Don't you want to play VR, dickhead? I don't even have hands. Okay,

171
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,349
crisis averted. Let's hope it doesn't do that shit again.

172
00:29:49,990 --> 00:30:19,829
Let's go. Imagine 1080. Okay, nobody move. Nobody breathe. Resident on shelf. Oh,

173
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:28,970
right. That's right. All right. God damn it, man. That was a nose scratch. That wasn't inside. You

174
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:35,289
didn't get you. It looked like I went in my nose, but I didn't. There you are. Okay, let's continue.

175
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:49,509
So I'm choking. I'm dying. I'm dying. Breathe. You can breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe,

176
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:59,990
breathe. You guys can breathe. All right. So, all right. Ow. I don't even know what I did to

177
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:07,299
trigger that happening. That's weird. All right. Resin on shelf. You mentioned it. Resin on shelf.

178
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:26,009
5K people watching. It may solve technical problems. Welcome to 90% of all VR. Ignored?

179
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,019
Ignored? What do you mean? Who did I ignore? Oh, right, right, right. Reddit on shelf or

180
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:40,250
something. Whatever it was. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the resin? Where is it? You said

181
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:53,349
it was on the shelf. Where is it? There it is. Thank you. Did I get it? I don't know if I even

182
00:31:53,349 --> 00:32:16,940
got it. 19 resin. I got it. Okay. Let's move. Pat. Yup. I'm to climb. Oh, I climb with one hand.

183
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:52,390
I'm fucking Spider-Man now. Oh, shit. What happened? Okay. What? There you go. Oh, shit.

184
00:32:52,390 --> 00:33:05,420
It's one of those things. Okay. Can I get through there? Wait, should I let him suck me up and then

185
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:21,670
I jump off? Suck me up. Up. Did I say up or did I say off? Which one? It's hard to hear.

186
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:31,900
Which one did I say? I said up, right? Okay. I can't even hear myself talk. This place is

187
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:39,289
overgrown. How dangerous do we think this stuff really is? Well, it is spores from another

188
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:46,490
dimension, so probably, yeah, extremely. But a rare opportunity to examine alien flora up close.

189
00:33:51,609 --> 00:34:03,940
Okay, I got 20 resin. What should I do with it? A lot of resin in here. Is there any other guns

190
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:10,440
in the game? Canyon Cube. Bomb. Derma, derma, derma. Attach the grenades to your pocket.

191
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:33,289
I can't. See? I got full shit. Box. One shotgun shell in there. What a joke.

192
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:52,900
Okay, can I go through this door? Take a little bro. Just chuck it over your shoulder. Bro,

193
00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:04,969
you have two pockets. Oh, what? No, no, no. What? Bro, bro, come on. Bro, bro, bro. I don't know

194
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:28,630
what you want me to do. What do you mean bro? Why is everybody saying bro? Hey, bro. Just chuck it

195
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:42,380
over your shoulder, somebody said. Okay, I'll try that. It didn't work. I'm not afraid to use this.

196
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:50,059
You better take it off the closer you get. Okay, they put creepers in the game.

197
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,710
They put Minecraft creepers in Half-Life. That's great. They're looking forward to that.

198
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:44,090
Gotta get the water from somewhere. Why is this glowing? Hey, hey, remember this? Classic Jim

199
00:36:44,090 --> 00:37:14,630
Carey. What the fuck am I holding this? Oh, it's soap. Oh, secret, secret, a secret, a secret,

200
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,469
a secret, a secret, a secret, a secret. Just keep moving. Secret, it's a secret. Maybe breeze-less.

201
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:53,539
Oh, I didn't get it. Okay, so now, what the hell do I do now? Did I? I go down. Down? Wait,

202
00:37:53,539 --> 00:38:11,449
something in here probably. Huge wardrobe for nothing. Hates us for punching. Fuck you. Bro,

203
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:23,269
look board in a row. Reddit spotted. Reddit spotted. Fuck you. What is happening? It's like,

204
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:27,030
I would imagine, oh yeah, Half-Life out. Let's talk about Half-Life. Alex, what does it feel like?

205
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:38,539
Kind of slimy, a little tingly. I feel like I don't want to do that. We're not even talking

206
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,300
about like, hey man, I'm speaking to you in Half-Life, Alex. No, you're talking about like,

207
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:54,170
dick and punch guy and larks. Should I drop? I'm gonna drop down. Okay, I made it.

208
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:08,840
I don't like that. It's like something's in my ear. This is a reeks. Oh, really? What does a reek

209
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:25,500
like? Be specific. Like a rotting animal mixed with ammonia. Oh, what cool vegetation. Penis dip.

210
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,860
Streamer has a small dick. The streamer has a small dick. Oh, Half-Life Alex, cool. Oh,

211
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,059
I wonder if the Vortigaunt is going to show up next. The streamer's penis is tiny.

212
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,480
Like, what are you guys even talking about? Oh, these things explode.

213
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:03,940
Come on, pop. Pop already. Pop. Oh, that's a big one.

214
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:15,739
Come on, pop. Pop. Oh, dude, that was the best fucking 90s commercial for any fruit snack

215
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:32,440
that you've ever eaten. What was over here? Going down? Oh, shit, let's keep going. All right,

216
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:58,619
hold on. Let me just, one, two, three, four. Oh, dick. You're still on that. You're still on that.

217
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:27,369
You're still on that, guys. You're still on it. Does that mean I have a tiny face? What's this

218
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:34,440
thing doing? What is that, and why is it doing that? Why is it doing that? What is that? I don't

219
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:46,739
know what that is, but I don't know why it's doing this. What is that? Should I take it? Oh,

220
00:41:46,739 --> 00:42:07,909
sorry. I just want the thing that's in your hand. Give it to me. Got it. What? Press to arm

221
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:29,800
send grenade? What the fuck is happening? Give me it. Give it to me.

222
00:42:54,469 --> 00:43:19,510
No, give it to me. Hey. Okay, we're good. Shit. What is that? Oh, man. A blast of berry flavor.

223
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:24,230
Y'all think you can handle it? I'll try doing two at the same time.

224
00:43:38,739 --> 00:44:18,599
Oh, sick. Oh, this is like 700. Bye bye. Who else wants this shit? Oh, man. And introducing Green

225
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:27,769
Apple. Oh, that would hurt. That would hurt my teeth. Mom, I think I have to go to the hospital.

226
00:44:27,769 --> 00:45:52,360
Oh, that's so good. It looks like he's just moving. I'm ready. Wait. Ah, okay. Let's make

227
00:45:52,360 --> 00:46:07,639
sure we're loaded. Guys, load it up and ready to rock and roll. One of those doors that only

228
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:27,369
one side opens. Okay. Hey, no, I'm in the right spot. Kind of. Oh, it's rambling. Don't come

229
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:51,940
near me, man. How should you? Who's the sorry bastard that's going to take this one right

230
00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:26,949
between the eyes? I need this. I don't have electricity. That thing doesn't have electricity

231
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:43,559
to it. What the fuck? Come on. No, I'm doing this wrong. I'll get it. I got to get a power

232
00:47:43,559 --> 00:48:02,469
source. The laundry room. Where did that thing go? What's that thing vulnerable to? Fire.

233
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:14,519
Okay. It's vulnerable to earth. Like a leaf spell. Hey, no pictures,

234
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:20,010
no photos. You got to pay for that. Oh, come on in. Yeah. Okay. 10 bucks.

235
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:34,360
Cool. Say Twitch. TV slash Jeremy. Thanks, man. Hey, teleport around. That's what's going on.

236
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:54,440
Wow. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Hey, no pictures. This guy sucks. Am I going to have to

237
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:57,699
creep up on him? No. Get over here. All right. Go to the chamber. That looks good. I would eat

238
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:02,659
that. That looks like a cool, it looks like ice cream. That's like blueberry cream ice cream.

239
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:07,460
I would just like shawarma style, man. I would just carve some of this off. Just like into a cone.

240
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:41,349
Where is this weird little stingray guy? He's toying with me. You know ceiling? Back here.

241
00:50:42,739 --> 00:51:50,920
Get over here. He's still alive. What? What's going on? What happened to him? Alex, Alex, what

242
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:58,360
happened? There was like a dog looking lightning thing. Oh, sorry. I missed that. Oh, that was the

243
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:07,719
boss. Killed it and it crapped out this thing. Put it on top of an ice cream cup. It's blue cream,

244
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:41,139
Alex. Ah, how's it go? Ah, is it hurting me? Put it in a health thing. Oh, shit. That could be used

245
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:47,989
in place of a, you know. All right. I don't want to look at it. If I don't look at it,

246
00:52:47,989 --> 00:53:09,719
it doesn't hurt as much. Done. Well done, Jeremy. Ow. He's a lollipop. Oh, thank you. Good. Health.

247
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:44,840
Shots. Shots. Oh, fair point. Have I ever rushed Jeremy? I'm jittery because of the game. He's

248
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:57,369
jittery because he went old turkey. Please don't wave. What? Why don't you get the shirt that says

249
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:21,449
Jerma? That was given to me from a gift. Gift. This is spectator capture right now. This is not

250
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:28,250
the, where are you? This is not mirror capture. This is actually like in game capture. And I have

251
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:34,010
the spectator view on smoothing and everything. Am I just like a jittery fucking mess? Is that what

252
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:52,500
the problem is? Wait, we can't hear you. Why not? Is it bad? Should I turn the volume down?

253
00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:56,760
And when I turn away from the microphone, yeah, that's definitely going to happen.

254
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:04,360
Four shots left. I'm out of shells. I was at 10 minutes left in the game. It's like the end,

255
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:31,849
right? Oh shit. It's one of these, okay. Red. Red. Blue. Blue. I got it already. Why is there a shield?

256
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:51,639
Fuck. Oh no. I didn't notice. I don't remember where they were.

257
00:55:52,840 --> 00:56:00,440
Red. Where's red? That's an orange. This is red. This is red. Red. Red.

258
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,170
That was weird. I don't know. That was weird. I don't know why I just did it.

259
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:12,019
All right. And now that's yellow. This is green. No, that's orange. Orange is

260
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:29,639
up here. Fuck. Okay. Okay. This green is right there. Okay. Orange is over here.

261
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:50,789
Purple. Yellow. Shit. It's going to restart. Okay. Now I get it. I get it. I get it. It's color

262
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:55,909
blind. I'm not color blind. I didn't understand the middle portion. All right. Yellow. Yellow.

263
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:58,630
Bang. Bang. We got red. Red. Red. Red. Orange. Orange. Red. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green.

264
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:30,309
Yellow. Yellow. Go. Go. Go. Go. One. Two. Did they make it easier for me? All right. Okay.

265
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:43,860
A shit talker. There it is. That elevator will take me up to the sub station.

266
00:57:52,219 --> 00:58:07,179
Boom. Did I do it? Wait. Did I actually just do it? What the fuck? There's a person over here.

267
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:30,460
There's a guy there. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I think so. Punk. Let's give it to me. Give it to me.

268
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:48,949
Give me another one. All right. There's explosive in there. Give me another one. Just give it to me.

269
00:58:49,670 --> 00:59:10,630
Give me that. You know. I got something in my pocket. Shit. Sorry, dude.

270
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:28,469
Wait, wait, wait. I got to do a video game. I got to do every single video game ever developed.

271
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:39,530
All right. I forgot. Oh, yeah. Fun. Cool. Let's, let's use that mechanic a thousand times.

272
00:59:47,500 --> 01:00:08,500
They've been here, right? What was the point of doing it? What was that? Why did I? What was that door?

273
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:20,119
Something in here? Reddit shelf. Germa resin. Reddit. Reddit shelf. Reddit shelf.

274
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:30,469
And explode. Why? Hey, what's what do you want? What's what do you want to do?

275
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:49,780
Resin on the shelf somewhere. Do you see resin? Oh, there is. Oh, I mean, is that a shelf or

276
01:00:49,780 --> 01:01:14,539
is that a duct? That's not a shelf. That's a duct. Grab. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

277
01:01:14,539 --> 01:02:10,760
Oh, we're supposed to go down here anyways. Who cares? I have no shock enamel.

278
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:25,800
Waste, waste, waste. I got plenty. I don't care. Nice little puppet show going on over there.

279
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:39,750
Let's see. Hey, guys. Hey, fellas. Hey, it's an eagle. All right. Now go to fucking bed.

280
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:59,269
What's going on down here though? Health station, station. There's a station of health station.

281
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:07,909
Station, station. Hey, come on out. Well, this is the part of the movie. This is the part of the

282
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:13,909
movie where the main character is in here right now. And they just know that I'm right underneath

283
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:26,539
and they go any second. I could just shoot where the you are. Couldn't I? Oh, thank God. He missed

284
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:50,309
us. Did I use this? What health down here? Why are there pockets? I don't have a pocket.

285
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:22,469
There's something in there. It's hard. Again. All right. Again. Swipe the David Buster's card

286
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:38,300
again. For God sakes. I'll get it. I'm getting those 500 tickets. And I didn't panic. You panicked.

287
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:57,559
All right. I need a power source. There's a shit load of health down here. Why is there so much

288
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:11,110
health down here? Secret. I'm going to put all the health in one spot. All the health is going

289
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:21,909
over here on this barrel. This is my healing station. It's my like healing shell. Wait,

290
01:05:21,909 --> 01:05:29,099
can I put it in a box and just take it with me? Yeah, I can. Get your ass. That's what I'm

291
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:44,230
fucking doing. We're going trick or treating guys. This is my fucking health bucket. It's coming with

292
01:05:44,230 --> 01:06:05,670
us everywhere. And this is the fourth one somewhere. I saw it. Fourth healing thing over here.

293
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:17,460
I know I saw it. Oh, trick or treating. Oh, nice. What'd you get? Oh, whoa. Dude. The Albertson house

294
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:30,090
is giving full size Snickers. Oh, you get three each? That's right, kids. Those are full size

295
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:41,699
candy bars. I'm an asshole. Remember, remember, rob this house. Here you go. Catch that. Line up.

296
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:47,980
Here's a full size three seats for everybody. I'm the house to rob. Thank you, kids. Have a

297
01:06:47,980 --> 01:07:14,760
great day. What happened to them? Raid song? We got a raid. Who raided? Raid? Who raided? Raid song.

298
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:21,400
Raid song. Raid song. Who, but who is the, I can't sing the song because I know who raided.

299
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:28,250
Astergear. Astergear, thanks for the raid.

300
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:38,010
That was kind of, I don't know, a thank you. Why I did that? I don't know what that doesn't,

301
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:42,679
that doesn't mean anything, apparently. I don't know. I was so nervous that you raided me.

302
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:54,199
I go, well, that's when they all leave. It's, no, they're here. Okay, this is where we're going.

303
01:07:54,199 --> 01:08:05,909
I keep losing my, gimme that. My trick or treat basket. I'm gonna fill this thing with trick

304
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:12,059
or treat items. It's a Halloween string now. Hey, oh, there's only two slots in your inventory.

305
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:27,960
No, there's 60. You just gotta fucking bring it with you. Oh, it's one of the electricity guys.

306
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:43,050
I hate you. Oh, crap. Lightning dog. Don't forget my trick or treat basket.

307
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:40,699
Hey, don't go near my trick or treats. Come here. Oh, he's in the vent somewhere.

308
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:48,500
Hmm. Okay, where's that fucking main character? He's in there going right now. He's like,

309
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:04,579
that went right by his ear and he went to the secondary main character that was right next to

310
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:11,510
him, behind him. If I'm in that movie, I'm just gonna fucking go like this.

311
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:33,369
All right, fuck it, he's gone. Actual villain. My trick or treat. Oh,

312
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:40,489
more fucking throw up jokes. If I do another throw up joke, I will end the stream, I promise.

313
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:53,430
That's like such low, that's so easy. Oh, shit. Awesome. Oh, dude, what do they got here?

314
01:10:55,609 --> 01:11:16,739
Oh, man, I'm in take five? What's the last time you had a take five, dude? Cool. Okay,

315
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:25,340
those of you guys that are playing Diablo 3, this is just the bounty boxes. When this hits full,

316
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:43,220
I'm gonna just sit there and open bounty cubes for like 10 minutes. Okay, let's go. Am I supposed

317
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:52,810
to turn on something? Oh, no, that guy, I gotta kill that thing and get the electricity thing.

318
01:11:54,329 --> 01:12:08,300
I'll just leave you a pillowcase full of Halloween candy down around.

319
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:35,829
Oh, that was close. Oh, dude, that went right by my face.

320
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:04,699
Where is it? Come on up. All right, come on up, you little bastard. Come on.

321
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:29,640
Get back here. Come here. Oh, do not. Do not.

322
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:45,020
Development? It went into a dead guy. No. Yes, I had to shoot both of them. It was

323
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:58,979
nuts, Russell. It sounds nice. Oh, it was. I think they're starting to fall out of the bottom.

324
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:22,060
How did it explode? Why would it explode? Okay, okay, you can't go in there. You can't go in there.

325
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:33,529
Oh, man, it's time. Oh, I'm so happy. It's so exciting. It's Halloween night. What'd you get,

326
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:50,539
dude? Oh, man. Oh, what's this? Oh, nice. Whoppers. Oh, what? Those are so good. I

327
01:14:50,539 --> 01:15:07,939
haven't had those in so long. What's this one? Oh, it's a hundred grand. Thanks, Mr. Stevenson.

328
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:41,560
Oh, really? Looks like the Gregory household is giving out little shitty stuff here.

329
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:57,850
One little bullet, huh? I don't have any room for these. I don't have any room for these. What

330
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:20,729
am I supposed to do with these? Drop the grub. Did I? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

331
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:41,289
Okay, I'm ready. Oh, do not. Oh, man. Do not drink an orange juice right after you brush your teeth,

332
01:16:41,289 --> 01:16:59,579
dude. What are you crazy? I was gonna say don't ever mix Reese's and fucking like a Hershey bars,

333
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,500
but that was going to be like, of course people do that all the time. I had to think of on the fly,

334
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:35,819
improvise. All right, where's the? Oh, right here. Hey, dude, have you tried the green slide flavor?

335
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:47,880
Oh, I can't carry it around anymore, guys.

336
01:17:54,779 --> 01:18:03,619
Vent, you blind fuck. Vent, you're a blind fuck. Vent, vent, vent, vent. Go to the vent. You're

337
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:26,760
blind. There's a vent. What are you doing, dude? Go to the vent. You started right and pulled the

338
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,439
orange one. The one get in the vent or I'll have you bent. Holy shit. He's going to miss the vent.

339
01:18:33,399 --> 01:19:15,739
What are you talking about? It's in the vent. This vent? Oh, no, on the floor. Floor? Vent, vent,

340
01:19:15,739 --> 01:19:22,810
vent. Doesn't matter. ADHD vent. Where is it? And I think I know what you're talking about.

341
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:30,460
The one that I pulled off, but I didn't go in. I don't remember where it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

342
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:53,529
I remember that. Thanks, folks. Pretty good. There's isn't another fucking strange scatter

343
01:19:53,529 --> 01:20:11,720
gun in here. I'm going to be real fucking mad. I can't go in. Let's go. Hey, thanks for the tip,

344
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:30,460
guys. Last two shows. Hey, you know, I appreciate you. Move. Oh, I just need to power the elevator

345
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:54,329
here. I gotta close the bus door. All right. I got, I got help.

346
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:04,470
Just think about it, Alex. Three miles an hour. Plus, he's a fugitive. He's only got one leg.

347
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,989
There's obstacles. No direct path. You know what? I'm not going to lie to you. He should be back by

348
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:17,430
now. Yeah. So I should be working. Normally, yes, but you're the one headed towards the danger. So

349
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:56,229
we should be the ones worried about you. Oh, it's one of these hard ones. Hello. We're going to do

350
01:21:56,229 --> 01:22:38,500
yellow right here. That is right here. I don't, I don't know what these are. Not a good yes. Open.

351
01:22:40,100 --> 01:23:05,270
Oh, upgrade station. What should I do? Right. How much resin do I have?

352
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:22,039
Second. Oh, true. Quick. I'm going for the pistol. You pulled my scottish.

353
01:23:46,359 --> 01:24:01,720
All right. What should I do? 33 resins. Bullet reservoir and additional bullets. That's a big

354
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:09,500
deal, man. That's a huge deal. I'm going with the bullet. I want more ammo. Yeah. Oh yeah.

355
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:29,079
That's what that's already. Wait, any more upgrade? That's it.

356
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:45,369
Oh, wow. Check it out. That looks really cool. You know, Russ, technically I don't think there's a

357
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:56,970
whole lot of your gun left anymore. Thanks for telling me how infinity war ends. Can I get a

358
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:08,340
grenade launcher? I'm going to scoff. Hello. Twitch TV admin. Yes. I'd like for you to ban

359
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:15,220
that fucking guy for at least two days. Thank you. Minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus

360
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,100
two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two. Oh,

361
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:32,680
wow. Actually not bad. All right. I got pistols. This lamp is huge. This lamp is too big, right?

362
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:44,489
Hey, hey, look, it's me. There's the monitor. That's what I'm looking at. That's me after every VR

363
01:25:44,489 --> 01:25:51,609
stream. Hey, guys, I just want to let you know that, yeah, I think it's been about four hours.

364
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:56,569
I can't do it anymore. I never like take a bath and do a hair treatment. Yeah, it's fun though.

365
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:14,619
Relax. Go lie down, Jeremy. That's not a good bed. This bed sucks. Holy shit. Dude,

366
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:22,869
are you living like this? Are you making like a bed out of wood? This is Minecraft?

367
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:53,510
That's the same way. See that? Oh, what's that? What happened? Why did the room just explode?

368
01:26:53,510 --> 01:27:17,020
Oh, it's you. Oh, shit. Read the bottle. Read the bottle. Read the bottle. Read the bottle.

369
01:27:17,739 --> 01:27:29,960
Hot car. Hold on. It's adjustment. I need a pants adjustment. We're on in a sec, guys.

370
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:37,699
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Just do a little pants adjustment. There we go. Hey, just make sure

371
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:44,979
the old pants adjustment happens. Every door opens this way. I hate that. I want doors to open in.

372
01:27:46,779 --> 01:27:56,260
Oh, there he is. Irma? Irma, you all right? Yeah, I just, I was going to take a bath and put oil in

373
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:02,789
my hair. I just really crawled over here. Yeah, I'm going to be okay. There's oil, oil all over my

374
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:08,149
hair and shit. There's olive oil and tea tree. Yeah, I haven't really turned on the water yet,

375
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:16,340
though. All right, man. Just, just relax. Take a bath. Let that oil get a seep in over here,

376
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:40,680
over your hair. Boots and jeans. That's not my look. Need to reload twice. That was a lie?

377
01:28:41,560 --> 01:29:06,859
Little lie? I think that was a lie. Oh, shit. All right, nice. Definitely putting on the new

378
01:29:06,859 --> 01:29:26,119
face mask has helped a lot. Check the mag. What? Need to drop the mag. I'll test it out.

379
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:43,140
Wait, about a toy, about a guy. Okay. Well, mag has been ejected. Empty inserted magazine.

380
01:29:43,140 --> 01:30:01,100
Press to eject magazine. Yes, what do you want me to do? Put a new one in. This is empty. Oh,

381
01:30:02,859 --> 01:30:11,000
oh, shit. I thought it was empty. Oh, all right. So you have to drop two empty magazines out.

382
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:19,510
That's too much. That's stupid. Oh, yeah. Game of the year, right? Don't say anything bad about

383
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:34,579
game of the decade. Oh, boomer. Oh, I hate those things.

384
01:30:43,369 --> 01:31:36,979
Boomer over there. Oh, that's pog room. I thought that was resin. Hey, all right. You want me to

385
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:43,619
want to give me a grenade? I guess I got take it. I guess I mean, I guess I'll take one.

386
01:31:43,699 --> 01:32:13,779
I guess. Thank you. Thank you. I guess. Thank you. Oh, I guess. Oh, dude, it's fog flavored.

387
01:32:14,659 --> 01:32:26,810
Oh, good flavor. What does that even mean? All right. Well, if they were Twitch TV. Hey,

388
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:33,859
if they were Twitch TV, popsicles and stuff, would you get like the germa pog flavor?

389
01:32:35,829 --> 01:32:38,710
That's I, if I had a popsicle, if it was like a germa 985,

390
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:50,460
it would be sour. It would be a sour popsicle. Probably like a raspberry of raspberry sour flavor.

391
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:36,390
No, I'm fine. Give me that. I can't make this jump. What happened? Why? I just died instantly.

392
01:33:37,109 --> 01:34:03,369
Is this the one? 336. I just took a step off. Got eaten by the stairs. It wouldn't give a star

393
01:34:03,369 --> 01:34:10,090
flavor like that to you. I'm not. You don't think I'm a star? I don't want to. How many stars do I

394
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:22,579
have? I'm not a Twitch star enough to get a raspberry. So what flavor would I get? Wait,

395
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:29,060
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, you are not going to designate the banana flavored popsicle

396
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:36,970
to me. No, I'm blue raspberry or green apple or grape. You're not going to designate like gross

397
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:57,020
banana flavored popsicle to me. No, I'm not going to be that. How dare you? Did it even kill?

398
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:06,340
Now I got to shoot him. I did it. Follow me. Follow me in this room. Follow me in this room.

399
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:16,760
Follow me in this room. Look, I'm in this room. Just kill me. Kill me so I can do it again.

400
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,779
Kill me so I can do it again. Just kill me so I can do it again. How do I die?

401
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:31,380
Just kill me. I want to do it again. Don't. I'm trying to just die. I can't die.

402
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:43,529
I want to do it again. Kill me. How do I? Do I have any grenades? Wait, there's a grenade in there.

403
01:35:44,409 --> 01:35:56,600
Give me this thing. Just let me. Are you aware? Was that a monitor? I think that might have

404
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:27,670
been a monitor. I think that was my monitor. Goodbye. Goodbye. Where's that microphone?

405
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:44,520
I'm sorry, guys. I smashed into this. I just crushed it. You were dropping.

406
01:36:45,859 --> 01:36:55,859
Better not me. Oh, shit, dude. That guy had to restock viewers. Fucking plummeting. I'm going

407
01:36:55,859 --> 01:37:06,310
to go watch a real stream. A guy that deserves like a blue raspberry flavor. That's me. Better

408
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:49,220
not get banana. Okay, here we go. Banana streamer. Reload again. Oh, my God. Reload again. Oh,

409
01:37:49,220 --> 01:38:12,180
my God. Reload again. Oh, my God. Reload again. Oh, my God. Am I not doing this right?

410
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:59,590
Hey, what are you two talking about? Hey, dude. V.O. That is instant death. We made it. Viewers,

411
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:22,739
minding.

412
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:50,729
Broken window. Okay, let's see what happened here.

413
01:39:51,930 --> 01:40:02,010
Past tray. Still hot. Smell. Oh, just the bed was a little disheveled. Down in a hurry, it seems.

414
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:14,220
Two beds. Effort beds. It looks like the escape route. What do we have here? What do we have here?

415
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:31,449
Throw some water in there. Thirsty. What a mess.

416
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:38,069
I wonder, uh, maybe, uh, I wonder what happened. No, don't do that.

417
01:40:40,569 --> 01:40:42,970
I'm sorry. I was going to start going into like Rorschach.

418
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:48,649
And the thing is, I wonder what happened in here. It's really possible that, you know,

419
01:40:48,729 --> 01:40:50,090
somebody would have carried in here.

420
01:40:58,869 --> 01:41:05,590
All those people. All those idiots. Those that look like they've been recently used.

421
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:14,180
A smell of shit. Just like the outside world. Just how I feel about the outside world.

422
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:30,250
False shit. That detected. Marge Simpson. It's pretty much Rorschach.

423
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:35,430
Just do, okay, go into your favorite pitch shifting software.

424
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:39,909
Take Marge Simpson and drop the pitch by about 10%. You got Rorschach.

425
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:56,119
Oh, I have to actually go out the window. As I got outside, I felt the urge to do a fall joke.

426
01:41:58,069 --> 01:42:13,800
I didn't do it. Society. I actually fell off.

427
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:36,600
I'm not trapped in here with you. I'm not trapped in here with you.

428
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:42,680
Yeah. I mean, that's true. I am trapped in VR, but it being like, I'm not trapped in here with you.

429
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:51,079
You're trapped in here with me. That's you guys.

430
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:19,579
Next window. I've got a delivery of milk.

431
01:43:20,859 --> 01:43:40,600
Okay. Hey. Special delivery, dickhead. Ah, that was fun.

432
01:43:53,670 --> 01:44:04,649
Why am I opening that? Why was he using the bathroom?

433
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:16,739
German. German. He finally got in. He got in the bathtub.

434
01:44:17,699 --> 01:44:32,220
Can I tell you about my big long bony fingers too? Wait, he was just in here.

435
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:45,109
What is this thing doing in here? Wait, this is the thing that flushed the toilet.

436
01:44:45,750 --> 01:45:02,329
Fuck on there. All right. Whatever. German after VR. Oh, that's so stupid. It's so true though.

437
01:45:03,449 --> 01:45:21,579
I think I did that exact pose and made that exact face last night in the bathtub. All right. Come

438
01:45:21,579 --> 01:45:26,859
on. Come on. We're going to home alone this guy. Come on. You're never going to be able to catch

439
01:45:26,859 --> 01:45:34,939
me. I'm getting your stupid little bread. Hey, come on barf. Be careful.

440
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:53,140
Come on, you big stupid idiots. Oh, he got him. Oh shit. It ripped his head off. Oh man. He's dead.

441
01:45:53,859 --> 01:46:16,010
It just tore his fucking head off. Turn, turn, turn. Turn, turn, turn.

442
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:31,640
Okay, that's dead. That instantly killed me. That probably weighs like 30 pounds. That would have

443
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:40,409
just caved in my fucking face. You've never seen Home Alone. Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 are some

444
01:46:40,409 --> 01:47:16,380
of the best movies ever. This is such a good movie. Open up. Hey, I'll give him a courtesy knock.

445
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:26,899
Okay. Anybody in there? You're about to be dead. Wrong building. Sorry.

446
01:47:30,520 --> 01:48:32,899
P.T. hallway. 424. Devil's number. 5. Devil's number. I was going to crush him with the TV.

447
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,260
I tried. I was trying to crush him with the TV. Didn't work out so well though. Oh well.

448
01:48:38,260 --> 01:49:18,979
I just announced my presence. I just called this alien. TV redemption. Something under there,

449
01:49:18,979 --> 01:49:43,829
isn't there? Is that resin? All right, let's deliver this TV into an alien's skull. Oh shit.

450
01:49:48,420 --> 01:50:12,760
Fuck, I wanted to turn it. Any more TVs? Are there any more TVs? Whoa, it's big.

451
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:56,569
You burst already? Oh, wait. Fuck. A one. Elevator. Hey, I just want to say, those of you that are in

452
01:50:56,569 --> 01:51:03,449
broadcasting school, some of you might be into audio. It's a fun one to say. That's also a good

453
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:10,170
one to say. Elevator. The elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator.

454
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:25,029
That's a good broadcast word to say. Psycho. Oh, he went to broadcasting school. He's a

455
01:51:25,029 --> 01:51:33,909
classically trained broadcaster. I can say, sorry for the audio problems. Sorry for the audio

456
01:51:33,909 --> 01:51:42,890
problems. I don't have a shock about it. I'm a professional. Sorry. I gotta back the fuck away.

457
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:47,399
Back away. Oh, you guys are all dead if I can do something.

458
01:51:53,800 --> 01:52:14,390
Disgusting rancid. I'm jumping me. Fit in there. He'll get grabbed by this guy. Oh shit,

459
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:23,300
it's just a thing at Best Buy to fucking demonstrate the ring doorbell. Hey.

460
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:56,760
Hey. That's a long way to go. Eat him. Eat him. Get grabbed by this thing. Oh shit, nice.

461
01:52:56,760 --> 01:53:18,039
What is that? Oh shit, it's a Roomba. I got it. I shot his eyeball up. That's like an evil Roomba.

462
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:36,760
We might as well just do this again. I feel like they think that's fun.

463
01:53:37,479 --> 01:54:06,300
Let's keep, I'm gonna have to go down there. I know it. Two more. Damn it. Okay, I think we're good.

464
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:31,000
It's a big power source. It's a big power cable. I've had enough already. They keep

465
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:38,229
running. Rough grenade, monster's belly. What the fuck is that? Did I just?

466
01:54:39,109 --> 01:55:56,119
Did that make the grenades more powerful? Thumbs up. Let's go down here. No. Arsehole destroyed.

467
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:03,659
I don't even need the grenades. I'll take another one though. I'll take another one. Sure. Let's go.

468
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:21,239
Upstairs. You go anymore? Go. Hey. Oh shit, there it is. There's the, oh that's a table.

469
01:56:21,399 --> 01:56:48,760
Okay. Um, whatever. Oh shit, all right. Oh, that's what I, I have no room for this and I must scream.

470
01:56:52,140 --> 01:57:06,890
Here. You take it. Hey, that was expensive. That was expensive.

471
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:36,020
Oh, there's a force field. Look at that. There's a combined shield blocking your path.

472
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:43,260
I'll figure out how to shut it down. Uh, where's the things? Power things over there?

473
01:57:43,979 --> 01:58:02,310
Yup, behind the painting. Always behind the painting. What? I have to go down? Follow the

474
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:40,550
giant cable. Oh, and really? Oh, come on. Just kill me? Hey, oh, hey, hey, oh. I can't see anything.

475
01:58:50,890 --> 01:59:06,939
That was a Homer Simpson scream. What the fuck? Oh, thank you. Thank you.

476
01:59:07,659 --> 01:59:28,939
Turn on the flashlight? I can't. Oh, what a lightsaber.

477
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:34,220
How are you sure? What? It's still in the case. They never leave them in the case.

478
01:59:34,779 --> 01:59:40,810
Nice. New weapon. I didn't even need to edit your genetic code. I know. I would've loved that.

479
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:51,739
Oh, that's okay. There'll be a next time. Insert power cell.

480
01:59:53,579 --> 02:00:13,029
What? How do I use? How do I store this? Can I store it? Erty, how do I store it?

481
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:41,880
Oh, it didn't do it that time. All right. Cool. How does it work? Get.

482
02:00:49,659 --> 02:01:00,439
Can't get in here. That's what the grenade was for. That's what the grenade was for.

483
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:05,699
They can't open doors, right? They can't open doors. It's locked. You can't open a door. I

484
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:14,090
know you can't. I've played this series before. Can't open doors. You're stupid.

485
02:01:30,649 --> 02:02:13,260
I have to go in there though. Okay. Load this twice. Fucking done twice. Get it. I know. I

486
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:36,970
figured it out. I get it. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Hello, boys. Oh, shit. A lot of ammo.

487
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:56,760
This is an insane amount of ammo for this gun. 240 rounds in it. Holy shit. Switch on.

488
02:03:04,819 --> 02:03:42,630
Oh, man. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, I hate the fucking dark. Okay. Let's go. They can't get in here.

489
02:03:43,859 --> 02:03:57,020
They can't get in here. I'm good. Get. Okay. Any more grenades? I think grenades. There's so

490
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:14,569
many of them. Oh. What the fuck? This is an infestation. It's infested.

491
02:04:18,279 --> 02:04:21,079
I'm just going to run. I'm just going to run.

492
02:04:21,079 --> 02:05:02,069
Okay. Here we go. I don't want to waste ammo. Move your mouth. Move your mouth.

493

You jump right here. Jump at me. Right here. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. I need you to jump right

495
02:05:15,989 --> 02:05:29,800

496
02:05:31,289 --> 02:05:36,489
He jumped over my head. Okay. One of those opportunities for being a little bit shorter

497
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:16,170
and out. The worst Elvis I've ever heard. It's not supposed to be good. I'm just scared.

498
02:07:21,029 --> 02:07:30,710
Don't fall off the edge. Geez. What are you doing? What are you people doing?

1279
05:33:26,389 --> 05:33:34,900
hair check oh man this is only the second time i've come out of the headset it's not good but

1280
05:33:34,900 --> 05:33:51,299
it's okay grateful for a normal human doing another hair treatment tonight oh my assessment of half

1281
05:33:51,299 --> 05:34:02,250
life alex so far is it's uh it's pretty solid it's pretty solid i'm a big fan oh and wow uh

1282
05:34:02,330 --> 05:34:09,349
actual actual perfect timing because this thing just ran out of battery this is the one that

1283
05:34:09,349 --> 05:34:13,830
broke though so i don't know if that's is that a bad sign is that low battery or is that a bad sign

1284
05:34:17,560 --> 05:34:22,040
all right let's uh do the subs let's chill for a minute and then i'm gonna get some food and

1285
05:34:22,040 --> 05:34:30,779
i'm gonna relax and lie down take a bath do a hair treatment thanks again everybody for watching

1286
05:34:32,229 --> 05:34:41,740
and thanks to all these subs appreciate it they were i'm gonna go through some of them actually

1287
05:34:41,740 --> 05:34:49,509
five community subs from ink cat five for marlin brando marlin brandio and then we got the five

1288
05:34:49,509 --> 05:34:58,470
and five from colonel dingleberry and just be i love it so far typically you can't see yourself

1289
05:34:58,470 --> 05:35:05,400
sitting in a vr game for more than three hours but it flows together very well the jeff sequence

1290
05:35:06,040 --> 05:35:11,139
okay you know when something seems so horrible and so terrifying that oh no i can never do it

1291
05:35:11,779 --> 05:35:21,240
it wasn't that bad considering it's just scary so valve definitely decided they were gonna make

1292
05:35:21,959 --> 05:35:28,060
you think of every vr game you've ever played it's the lookout here comes the scary monster

1293
05:35:28,619 --> 05:35:36,709
right and it's coming to get you in the headset hey how about a shooter where you gotta shoot

1294
05:35:36,709 --> 05:35:41,939
headshot duck duck use cover hey we've got like weird little puzzles where you gotta look through

1295
05:35:41,939 --> 05:35:47,619
the wall with a little device they kind of just took every vr game that was an hour long and

1296
05:35:47,619 --> 05:36:02,659
made it a 12 hour long game so i think it's pretty good i'm very surprised that it's this long

1297
05:36:03,220 --> 05:36:07,479
you know when they first announced this i really thought this is going to be some kind of

1298
05:36:08,580 --> 05:36:14,569
demo because the index was coming out and i thought this is gonna oh look half life alex

1299
05:36:15,669 --> 05:36:20,790
it's like an hour and a half and it's just kind of fun and you play around with alex vance and

1300
05:36:20,790 --> 05:36:25,590
that's it i did not know that it was going to be a full experience like this so it's very very good

1301
05:36:26,310 --> 05:36:33,740
we will finish it tomorrow it's a full triple a game oh yeah it absolutely is

1302
