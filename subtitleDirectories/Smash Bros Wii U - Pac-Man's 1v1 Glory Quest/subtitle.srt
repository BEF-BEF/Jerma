1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,490
This is a one-on-one. I haven't even unlocked like any characters. It doesn't even matter. Does it really matter?

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,059
Do I need to unlock characters when you got fuckin' Pac-Man on this list? Gotta make sure I choose my right control setup.

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:28,780
Who's first? Who's first in the For Glory ranked 1v1 Pac-Man vs. the Entire Universe?

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:38,990
Yeah, we get this guy's Robin. Two-stock. Let's do it. I'll show you guys how it's done.

5
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,950
I'll show you how to... I'm gonna be one of the most professional

6
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,630
athletes you've ever seen in this game.

7
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:52,619
See, all I know is that you gotta have the hydrant down. When the hydrant's down, you can do extra damage.

8
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,619
You can launch it at people

9
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,159
or you can just get hit by everything that he's done so far. That works, too.

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,759
You see that? Do you see that hydrant play? You see that hydrant play?

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,400
See that? You see that double? Oh my god, you're talking about the best fuckin' Pac-Man in the world.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,680
I don't really have a follow-up to that one.

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,400
I gotta like concentrate. I don't want to lose this. This is my first ever ranked match.

14
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:31,769
You know what I mean? You can't like screw this up. I want to come down. Is that right? 104%. I'm doing good.

15
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,829
I'm doing fine. No, I'm not. That was a mistake. And now she's gonna launch it again at me. No, do not dodge!

16
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,780
Fuck!

17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,250
I missed! I missed again!

18
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,700
All right, sit up. Fucking sit up and play the goddamn fucking game.

19
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,819
That fire move. What was that? I don't even know these characters yet. I don't know what I'm doing.

20
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,430
There we go. All right, time to shape up.

21
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,360
That was close. That was a hydrant play. This is a hydrant play.

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,460
This is a hydrant play. Right here, guys.

23
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,139
Hey, we're gonna play Smash Brothers?

24
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:36,289
How about we play Jerma gets publicly embarrassed? That works, too. How did you- what is this?

25
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:38,969
What is this, like, super smoke that you're doing to me?

26
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:48,949
I'm telling you, comeback of the year right here, guys. You think it's a joke? Oh, come on. What is that move?

27
00:02:49,349 --> 00:03:03,699
It fell off. It's all right. I can recover this. Oh, did you see that recover? Come here! Come here!

28
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,120
How am I still here?

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:18,460
No, what the fuck? Drop it. I know what you're gonna try to do.

30
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:27,490
Sure, I could have capitalized on that, but I didn't. All right, now I gotta launch it. Now I gotta launch it.

31
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,939
Bang. It's all right. He's a little- he's a little confused. Now I get him with the fruit.

32
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:45,129
Oh shit! That one was backfired. What? What? Why did that not hit him? That went right through his body.

33
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:53,479
That was a load of dog shit. It's all right. I can- I can recover from this one.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Dammit, I threw the jello in the wrong direction. I lost. Throw the flu- throw the strawberry at him.

35
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,800
You picked up my strawberry?

36
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,280
You used my own strawberry on me? That's when you turned it on.

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,500
Now I'm angry you picked up my strawberry not long ago. Those strawberries took the grow on my farm.

38
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,060
Two months! How long does strawberry take to grow? Like, a week? I don't know.

39
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,819
Ten days? No, that's UPS ground shipping. We're not talking about ground shipping. We're talking about strawberry growth.

40
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,579
There we go. Now that you did that, you really started- you really got me angry with that one. Okay, I'll just come grab you.

41
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,550
Nope, I missed. Oh, I got to win this one. Come on.

42
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:55,810
Don't do it. Oh, don't do it. Don't do it, you motherfucker! I lost again!

43
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,879
19 ranked games and only two victories.

44
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:13,449
I have a 10% win rate. Guys, I'm pretty sure that I have better winning percentage

45
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:20,579
with scratch tickets. I feel like I've played the lottery in one more games than I have in fucking Smash Brothers.

46
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,569
Pac-Man versus Bowser, huh?

47
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:34,199
All right. I heard you liked balloons. Oh dear. Okay, I gotta be careful. He has like

48
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
some dash moves and stuff, I think.

49
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,040
Wait, can he grab you and like drop you off the stage?

50
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,600
Oh, I almost just- I almost just died there. See if I can get him. Got him.

51
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,720
Whoa, can he do that from the trampoline? Shit. I think that's the move I'm thinking of that he has.

52
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:03,579
Don't even think about it. You know, I get too caught up in dropping that hydra. That's like the pro-

53
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,040
What- I'm sitting here talking. Rude. I was telling a story.

54
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,850
I apologize in advance,

55
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,769
but I gotta be quiet for this one. So enjoy- enjoy the gameplay.

56
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,089
Enjoy the gameplay because that's what's gonna be in the background of this gameplay commentary.

57
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,290
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

58
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,930
Uh, this is post, so I'm not playing the game right now. That's because, you know, you probably could guess.

59
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,060
I suck.

60
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,959
I got a- I got a new costume. You know, it's all about the costume, I think, in my opinion.

61
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,160
If you don't have a good costume on, I mean you might as well. Why did none of us hit that?

62
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:05,529
Oh, that would have been sick if I just hit it with him. Come here. Jump into it.

63
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,259
Oh, you got hit by the balloon.

64
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,819
Oh, that was a full smash.

65
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,579
Right, we're good. We're good.

66
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,870
Didn't want to do that, but it's all right. It's- it's still kind of worked out. Drop the hammer on him. Turn around.

67
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,870
Smash it into him.

68
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,910
Perfect. Follow up with the up in the air. Up in the air, trampoline.

69
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,670
Double.

70
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,389
Yep, that's exactly what I wanted to have happen. And then,

71
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,949
you're gonna throw the key at him. Oh shit. No, you're not. You're gonna throw the fucking balloon at him again.

72
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:41,750
It's gonna miss. It's all right. I got a- I got an advantage over this one.

73
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,379
Damn it.

74
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:01,019
He's at 72%. I should- I should get this. I should be all right. Oh, come on. That's what it is right there.

75
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,560
You can't- you can't recover for this one.

76
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,839
Come on.

77
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,910
Oh, damn it. I missed again.

78
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:26,259
Oh my god, I'm just grabbing you with my radar. No, he grabbed me. Did I just bounce off his head? I did.

79
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:40,679
That's fine. I'll just launch you like that. Save it. Save it. Save it. Come on. Let me- let me- he's got 128%.

80
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,330
I should get this. There it is. Come on. I did it. Yes!

81
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,549
This is too stressful.

82
00:08:52,549 --> 00:09:03,320
Is there anything in this game that's like not as stressful as 1v1 for glory mode? Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

83
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,100
Eight player smash.

84
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,340
Nobody knows what's really going on with their character. It's just a mess.

85
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,330
It doesn't matter who wins or loses in eight player smash.

86
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,649
It just goes in front of the screen. No, but it doesn't matter.

87
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:27,139
I don't even know where I am. I'm up here on the right. Jigglypuff, you're dead. Eat this.

88
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,559
If I aimed in the right direction, that would be great. There's no competitiveness here.

89
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,019
It's just Diddy Kong

90
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,659
and Mario. Flame Mario, by the way.

91
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,529
Am I gonna win? I have a chance here, guys, to win

92
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,820
against a bunch of brainless computer players.

93
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:02,149
Okay, it's just down to me. Nope. It's just down to me and Dark Pit. We both have pretty high health. What's going on?

94
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,179
Why am I doing that?

95
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:15,370
I will beat you. Yeah, get spiked. Yeah, get dumb. I won.

96
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,110
I think that qualifies as if anyone could that's watching could qualify.

97
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,389
Pac-Man eight player smash victory against all cpu players that you've made the easiest difficulty.

98
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,539
It's got to count for something. It's got to count for something, right? I mean, it's got to count for something.

99
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,580
It's got to mean it's got to count for something, right? I mean, it's got a thing, right?

100
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,019
I mean, oh, um thing, right?

101
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,669
Okay. Bye guys.
