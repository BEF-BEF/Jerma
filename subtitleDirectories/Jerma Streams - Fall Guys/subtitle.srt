1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:16,649
I'm gonna go to the official Fall Guys Twitter, and we'll see. We'll see. Okay, it is...

2
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,460
Stop, stop it! People are playing it. All right, let me, let me just open it. Let me see what happens.

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,090
There's other people streaming it right now. Oh shit, really? Okay, let's try.

4
00:00:40,090 --> 00:01:00,649
And turn off, turn off like the fucking fantasy music. All right, I'm giving this a shot.

5
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:12,859
Got him again. I don't think you got me again. All right, pull it up. There it is.

6
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:35,049
All right, come on. Let's go. Come on.

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:02:00,700
All right, how do you play? Navigate the obstacles and race to the finish line.

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:17,879
Okay. Oh shit. Okay, navigate the obstacles and get to the finish line. Is there a jump? Which one am I?

9
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:28,330
Okay, there's a jump. There's a dive. These are all other players, right?

10
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:33,689
Oh, you all just got instantly eliminated by the fucking Mario thing from Bowser's Castle.

11
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:40,389
I've been playing games for 10, 100 years. Who's... I'm getting like notifications on my phone.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:59,020
How do I do this? Is it a bouncy? Oh shit. All right, I'm in like, I'm in like 14th place.

13
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:19,900
What happened? This is the risky way. You gotta go the risky way. Good. I'm okay. What was that?

14
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:36,229
What was that? Is it like, is it like drifting behind somebody? Oh shit. Fall count one.

15
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,490
All right, what place did I make it in? I qualified. I came in 10th place.

16
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,259
People just can't get that thing on the ground. All right, I gotta change my,

17
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:08,580
I gotta change my title. I'm finally playing Fall Guys. Finally. Hunting for treasure chests.

18
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:29,209
Whatever. Did I make it? 32 remain. That's me. But Fall Guy 8300. What happens if you qualify?

19
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:40,250
Wait, you could be a soda can? How do you get these new things? Memorize the icons on the tiles.

20
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,449
When an icon is displayed on the screen. I didn't get that all of that. What does it say?

21
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:56,889
Match the icon on the screen to avoid the slime. Match the icons?

22
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,100
And nine. All right, so it's cherries and grapes. And so I've got to stand on whatever's on the

23
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:29,990
screen. Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry. It's cherries. I don't get it. What? Oh, I have to

24
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:44,019
I thought I had to memorize them when it went to zero. Oh, I get it. It's that, okay. I get it now.

25
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:50,839
I get it now. What the hell? Now I can't do, am I done? Did I lose? Am I actually done, done?

26
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:09,959
Oh, shit. What's happening? Wait, did I get some points? I made it to round one. I got $85,

27
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:17,720
$43, and I'm almost level two. All right, I'm, I'm ready to go. I'm going to turn it up a little

28
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:35,610
low. Your one day game is over. See you tomorrow. Stop. I'm so glad I get to actually play. I

29
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:44,420
thought we weren't even going to see this at all today. 46 out of 60. That's it. Do people

30
00:06:44,420 --> 00:07:05,800
not know it's back up? All right, now I understand. So is this randomized or is it the same one every

31
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:15,720
time? It's randomized. Okay, that's cool. Wait, I want to be the french fry guy. How do you unlock

32
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:29,990
costumes? I'm going right and I'm going to go straight and then I'm going to go right again.

33
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:49,829
I'm going left. Why do you go faster than other people?

34
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:11,449
Get up. That's just not even possible to do. I'll take fucking first place. I'll take first place.

35
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:21,639
Oh, I'll take first place. Thank you. I'll take it. First place. What did I say? I was looking for

36
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:38,860
10th. All right, now don't fuck up the rest of this. That's cool. How many rounds are there?

37
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:53,700
Struggle. When you're number one, you just sit back and just watch the rest of them. Just,

38
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:15,960
just try. Don't worry. I'll be down there next round. Who's next? Oh, you're not you. Who's left?

39
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,149
Oh, there's one person that didn't make it. Is it zooming in on me? How do I do a thing?

40
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:34,710
33 remain. Turn off the music. Um, there's a toucan outfit too. It seems like a lot of outfits.

41
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:45,299
Okay, this is important for me to stay in first place. Dodge the flying fruit

42
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,340
and race up the conveyor belt. So dodge the fruit, race up the belt. I'll be first place.

43
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:02,970
Shouldn't I be in the front of the first in the row like Mario Kart? What's this bullshit?

44
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:21,980
Shit. Right at the middle. That was right at me. That was right at me. You aimed it at me.

45
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:32,379
By the way, the bodies are hitting me. The bodies are just crumbling on me.

46
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,009
You know what you got to do? You got to hug one of the sides.

47
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:59,659
Shit. Come on. I got to qualify. I'm not going to qualify. 16, eight. What? How did I come in

48
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:11,940
first place and not even qualify in this one? I told you this one sucks. Oh, this is kind of

49
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:27,899
fun though is movement acceleration. Don't jump. Oh, that's good to know. I have coins to spend.

50
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,899
Well, let me do like four or five of them and then we'll figure it out.

51
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:37,830
Just don't jump. Keep to the sides and don't jump. When did we get in a full room of 60? Only like

52
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:49,539
30 to 50. Break through doors and race to the finish line. Some are real, some are fake. Oh,

53
00:11:50,659 --> 00:12:06,409
wonderful. I like that song. That's the kind of shit that I sing in the bathtub. I like it.

54
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:15,340
Oh, right in the middle. I'm thinking one, two, three, four, five. Just count. Start at one.

55
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,570
Just go one, two, three, four, five. Start one, next one, two, next one, three. Watch.

56
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:50,840
One. Get out of the way. Are they all like this? I can't be in last place. There's a huge bottleneck

57
00:12:50,840 --> 00:13:03,830
coming up. I kind of fell down. Good. All right. Yeah. Fuck that. I'm going. Get out of the way.

58
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:20,519
Just jump. Just do it like jump. Jive into the end zone. Get out of the way. It's because I walked

59
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:29,769
in the wrong one. I went right to the left side and it instantly put me in last place. Am I stuck

60
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:48,379
here? I walked right to the first wall. What the hell? Oh, I'm stuck. You were so bad that the lobby

61
00:13:48,379 --> 00:14:05,320
broke. No, it didn't. No, it didn't. Yeah, we're good. All right. So you're saying I can buy

62
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:23,399
something. 500 kudos. Earn fame. Outfits. How do you buy outfits? Oh, wait. This is 500. Okay.

63
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:36,779
I have 12. All right. I can do ninja. I can do featured items. DLC store. Regular items.

64
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:50,840
There's be the egg. 7,000. I can't do that. You need crowns. I'm just going to get cucumber.

65
00:14:51,559 --> 00:15:18,840
Oh, it's probably. I'm glad I do that. This is just green. This is a big cucumber. Have to

66
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:32,500
win at least once. You're a pickle of 2500 subs over two streams. Won't buy $7,000 worth of fake

67
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:47,980
currency. Hey, first of all, I just opened the game 20 minutes ago. He turned himself into a

68
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,399
pickle. Oh, I see what you're doing. Run and balance across rows of seesaws to reach the finish

69
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:15,480
line. I'm going to lose this one. So you have to balance. Jesus, the whole thing turns. Well,

70
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:27,350
we can't all go on the left side. You're going to dump me. Don't dump me. Balance it out first.

71
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:40,389
Shit. Oh no, they're going to dump us. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. I got lucky too. I'm fine.

72
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,519
These people are just ruining this. I'm not going to wait around. These people,

73
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,919
these people are idiots. I'm going. Oh my God. I have to go this way.

74
00:16:50,360 --> 00:17:07,750
Put it back up. Is there a punch? I'm okay. I'm still fine.

75
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:21,529
There is punching. All right, we've got to even this out so we can all get across.

76
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:38,339
No, somebody go on the right side, please. Oh my God. It almost didn't work. Wait, how do you do

77
00:17:38,339 --> 00:18:01,559
that? Grab people. Well, how do you grab people? R2. That's kind of mean. This is the guy that was

78
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:15,400
doing it. Depending on your preference. Oh, okay. I don't think this guy even, this is just like

79
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:24,119
such a seasoned veteran. He just kind of walking around. The worst game is slime game. So many

80
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:32,900
people get knocked out. We'll see if we find it. You have to grab some ledges. How do you pull

81
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,680
yourself up? If I jump and hold R2, will I automatically do it or just hold up or do I

82
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:51,160
have to keep holding R2? Move between rotating rings to avoid falling into the slime. This is

83
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:04,619
what you were talking about. All right, come on. Let's go. Avoid the slime.

84
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:23,859
That's slime right there, isn't it? Can I touch the donuts? Where's this next slime? Oh,

85
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:28,980
shit. This is going to make me throw up. Okay. I'm good. This one's going wicked fast. Why?

86
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:35,049
Slime incoming. I just jumped into a slime. Slime over there. Go back.

87
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:56,980
Do they just keep going back? Get off me. Oh, I'm just trying to like kill a guy. Oh, shit.

88
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:22,490
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. How many more? Oh, you fucker. I deserved it. I know because I'm trying to push

89
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:32,329
people off the edge. I was trying to push people off the edge. I deserve it. Why didn't I do that?

90
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:55,049
I was right about to qualify for round three. I'm going to have trouble in this game because

91
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,930
I can't pay attention for more than one consecutive round. I will try as hard as

92
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:05,049
I can on two rounds in a row. Then by the third round, I'll start talking to you guys about an

93
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:19,500
animal I saw in the backyard yesterday. It'll be over. Here we go. All right. Let's get a full one.

94
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:35,319
Change your username to improve matchmaking. What do you mean? Obstacles. It's just obstacles. Watch

95
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:48,009
out. This one's kind of short. All right. That's going to be really hard up there. All right.

96
00:21:48,009 --> 00:22:04,809
I'm ready. What animal was it? It was a chickadee. It was eating a bug. That one's spinning.

97
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:26,619
That was mean. No, don't get wedged in. Y'all can't go in at the same time.

98
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:55,819
Wait, all those people just got screwed. Are they done? Birds just pretend to be real.

99
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:12,619
What? Can we be spied on? Birds aren't real. They're just robots. Birds are spy cams. So what are

100
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:25,450
the eggs? You don't leave two Logitech cameras together and then come back in a few months and

101
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:39,940
there's six of them. I don't know how that works. Wait, use RT to grab a tail? I don't even know

102
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,180
what that said. I'm going to instantly eliminate. Make sure that your team has more tails than the

103
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:52,309
rest of the. What do you mean tail? We're on teams. We have to grab tails. Whose tail?

104
00:23:53,029 --> 00:24:19,079
Our tails? Their tails? You got it. Got it. I don't understand. What do I get? Do I get a tail back?

105
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:37,819
Get his tail. Golden tails. Oh, you mean this guy right here. Oh, shit. I get it.

106
00:24:37,819 --> 00:25:07,430
Who has one? Give me that. That's a good strategy. Just go by the mallet.

107
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:23,670
I need it. I didn't get it. We only have three tails in 30 seconds. Go get another one.

108
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:44,119
We got five. All right. I got to protect this guy. That's me. That's my guy. Give me that tail.

109
00:25:45,579 --> 00:26:12,019
Oh, come on. No. No, it's us. It's us. Fuck. This game's so hard. No, that was my fucking teammate.

110
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:15,220
My fucking teammates couldn't do anything. They fucking weren't grabbing tails and everything.

111
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,259
I had a tail for like 10 seconds. None of my fucking teammates had a tail for more than

112
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:37,940
fucking one second, dude. Toxic. You immediately gave it. Yeah, but I didn't even know how the

113
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:58,680
game worked. You need to smash the PC in rage. I don't think this is a rage game. I think this

114
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:06,519
is a sit with your feet up on the couch with a bowl of pretzels on your crotch. Just eating

115
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:18,759
and just like kind of giggling every few minutes. I'm not sure this is a rage game,

116
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,220
though. We'll see. Are you watching a stoner comedy?

117
00:27:35,750 --> 00:28:00,140
Kind of. No, there's too many people in the way. Good. I qualify right here.

118
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,369
In the middle. I have to get off of me. Go back to fucking Rugrats.

119
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:34,140
He's just trying to push people off of the edge. And that is what made your downfall.

120
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:41,059
Now I'm in first place. You put a one. Does that matter at all? By the way,

121
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:52,259
it doesn't matter at all as long as you qualify. Okay. So that's why people are standing at the

122
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:56,420
edge and just pushing every single sorry motherfucker that comes over here and just

123
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,220
pushing them off the edge because they just want to make sure they lose in the first round.

124
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:24,859
Okay, that sounds like fun. I want slurpy guy to make it. Oh, that's unfortunate. How many

125
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:32,779
rounds are there? Three? You get more points the better that you do. There are five. Oh boy.

126
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:40,980
I've got to do this. No, not this one. I hate this one. Wait. No, I like. Okay. This is I

127
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:49,130
fucked this one up last time. I'm not going to mess it up this time. The idea is to just memorize

128
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,779
where two of them are. So I'm only going to memorize where the cherries and the grapes are.

129
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,130
I have to look at it from the same angle. Okay. Two cherry cherry on here.

130
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:06,460
Two cherries in the corner. Bananas right there. Just I know where the cherries are.

131
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:12,920
I know where the cherries are. And I know this too, but I wait, this is the last one you see.

132
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:25,500
What does he want us to do? Jerry. I'm safe right here. I was an asshole and I'm about to pay for

133
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,900
it. I don't do that. I was kidding. Right. Looking for a watermelon. Don't touch me.

134
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:40,279
Okay. Grapes. Don't do it. Okay. I don't know. Okay. Watermelon grape. I know where the grapes

135
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,799
and I know the watermelons are. I don't know what anything else is. Oh no. Okay. I think it's over

136
00:30:43,799 --> 00:31:03,460
here. Okay. It's cherries, apples and bananas. I mean blueberries. I don't know. Okay. I know

137
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,940
where the apples are. I don't know. I know the oranges are. Wait, is this an orange or an apple?

138
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:25,430
Yeah. Finally, I made it to the third round. First time I've ever been to the third round.

139
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:48,630
Eliminate very many people. There's still 30 people. Not this again. Oh wait. Jump and dive

140
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,329
through the hoops to score points for your team. I should be pretty good at this. I have to dive

141
00:31:54,329 --> 00:32:03,460
through the hoops. All right. I'm going to do so well here. Watch this shit. Yellow team is about

142
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:25,430
to have like 10 to 15 points. I didn't know it did that. All right. Let's go. I'm going to go up

143
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:51,960
here. Huh? I didn't get that one. How? What? I'm staying over here. I'm going to get this one. I'm

144
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,140
going to get this one. I'm going to get this one. It's all right. I got it, buddy. Good. That's a

145
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:25,720
double. Don't even go for it. You're not going to. A lot over this way. I had that one. No, we're

146
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:39,849
fine. Hey, right here. I'm going to spawn right here. 37. They're coming back though. This is not

147
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:53,509
good. 38, 31, 20 seconds. Anything can happen in 20 seconds. No. Why is Brett so good?

148
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:06,650
Oh, they're not coming back. 38, 43, 38. There we go. Blue team going.

149
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:23,690
That was total zone control. Was it? Damn. Now we're down to 20. Okay. This is where it gets

150
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:38,300
interesting. Zoned. Work together to push your ball to the finish line before the other team.

151
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:52,969
Oh no. Okay. Okay. I get it. I'm on blue team. So I'm going to go on the right side.

152
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:58,329
Just be gentle. Honestly, this really should be like two people doing this.

153
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm actually not doing that bad. All right. Somebody has to sacrifice themselves to get it

154
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:21,960
up here. Turn it. Turn it. Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Good. Keep going this way. Weave it. Weave

155
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:31,239
it. Weave it. Don't push it backwards. Weave it. It's not going to fit through there. Oh no. Oh no.

156
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,409
We're fighting each other. Just go. Oh no. We're going to lose.

157
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:49,989
We're going to go. Get it down the hill. What are you doing? Wait, it's these guys. They're

158
00:35:49,989 --> 00:36:13,480
infiltrating us. Who's going to get eliminated? No, it's going to be red. Reds was stuck. Is that

159
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:31,699
what they kept on infiltrating? 13 remain. Is this the last event? Okay. I got to play well here.

160
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:40,010
What's the last event? Four pieces fall away when you stand on them. Keep moving and survive

161
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:52,570
longest to win the crown. What? So don't step on any pieces. Oh shit. But what about these ones?

162
00:36:53,130 --> 00:37:13,019
I'm going to stay up all night. I got to, I have a plan. I got a plan. Just do it very slowly.

163
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,219
You can have your own spot. I don't care.

164
00:37:41,800 --> 00:38:20,039
I saw him coming from my peripheral and it fucking freaked me out. He sprinted by. He was just being

165
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:26,119
an asshole. He was just trying to dump all the, I was, could have been up top still. Oh, I had it.

166
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,090
I was in fifth pillar. Oh, damn it. It's just these two. It's this guy. That's the guy that ran

167
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:49,059
across and just was cutting everybody off. He wins. The guy that's made it a brain matter.

168
00:38:50,099 --> 00:39:00,630
Hey, good job fall guy. Three, eight, five, four. I think he's level two.

169
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:21,880
I got bubble gum. Sure. Put it on. You're doing really well. I thought I could stay up top. I

170
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,519
was one of two people up top and then I fell and my dumb idiot brain didn't realize that all the

171
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,030
other layers were going to be just ripped apart. I don't know why I was thinking, Oh, I'll be up

172
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:48,019
here for a little while. I fell through all, I fell through four layers. You got to be Pickle Rick.

173
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:54,809
No, I'm getting, I'm going, this is cotton candy. He's like, aren't these my colors?

174
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:17,289
Where's my chin? I'm more green, a little more green. Bad idea to go to the middle one. I told

175
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:23,929
you it could be a hot dog, all kinds of different food condiments and stuff. This is awesome.

176
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:55,690
That was bullshit. And I did a front flip too. Get in there. Get in there. No, no, no, no, no,

177
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:26,860
no, no, no, no, no. Oh no. Who's the last one? Oh, not you. Not you. 39. So what, what, what is

178
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:53,429
the most eliminated round one or like three? Fuck. I think this is the thing everybody hated

179
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,320
qualified one only. Okay. I was going to say only one fucking person qualifies.

180
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:22,139
I'm going to take this slow. Wait, good idea. Bad idea. Let's do the right way.

181
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,280
Wait, there's a secret over here. That's not

182
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:59,019
good. It's just like too many people that don't jump. Whoa. They bounce backwards.

183
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm good. You had to jump at the exact same time. Didn't you? You had to do that. Why did we both

184
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:49,059
do it at the exact same time? The guy was just like standing there. Oh, I can be Patrick. Yeah,

185
00:43:49,059 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm being Patrick. Your pretzels would be everywhere right now. No, no, no. I would make

186
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:17,460
sure that the integrity of the pretzels was completely and totally sound Patrick impression.

187
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:27,659
Okay. Uh, SpongeBob, what's that supposed to mean? I don't understand. That'll be a hundred

188
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:53,269
dollars. Please don't do that. Is this a PS4 exclusive? No, it is a PC. I'm down with the

189
00:44:53,269 --> 00:45:00,889
losers. Great. Oh shit. There's a naked Patrick. I have to be, I have to be aware that I'm not

190
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:18,980
the naked Patrick. I'm regular Pant Patrick. Okay. I get hit by reverse upside down ball

191
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:46,659
Patrick. Sens Fortress. So yeah, it kind of is like Sens Fortress. Okay. Does the hot dog soup

192
00:45:46,659 --> 00:46:09,820
cost like $7? You can earn it. Okay. That's cool. Is it going to choose wants to choose something?

193
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:20,860
I don't think it's might be locked out. Oh, okay. All right. Now I know what this is. I'm going to

194
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,500
be very, very, very serious. You know what that means? I'm going to go to the corner. I'm going

195
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,860
to put myself in the corner and back my tail into a, into the wall and no one will touch me

196
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:48,489
for the entire game. But I don't have a tail. Get away from him. You're not going to touch him.

197
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,869
We have four. Okay. I'm occupying one of their premium content players.

198
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:29,690
Can you get it? You little shit. Hey, come here. You little bastards.

199
00:47:29,690 --> 00:48:01,050
Oh, who has one? Who has one? Who has one? How does red team has zero? All right. Give me a

200
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:26,489
fucking premium two cam. What? You didn't touch my back. You didn't touch my back.

201
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:39,619
You didn't touch my back. Oh, it doesn't matter. You just have to grab the person. Oh, I thought

202
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:46,059
you had to like grab their tail. I was going to say, I thought now I get why I couldn't cheese it.

203
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:53,500
Okay. I'm trying to grab their tails. I'm trying to grab them from behind.

204
00:48:54,219 --> 00:49:08,789
They got carried. That's all right. Carried to first place. Grab eggs. Store them in your team's

205
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:16,889
nest. Okay. We have to get eggs and put them in our nest. Put the most eggs in your team's basket.

206
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:37,989
Oh, this is cool. I like this. I almost didn't get one. Hey, get out of here. Get the fuck out

207
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:52,170
of here. Get this guy. You're not taking any eggs. Come here. Oh, rabble rabble. Whatever.

208
00:49:52,170 --> 00:50:02,150
Fuck it. I don't care. Wait, somebody do we need? Oh, he's just getting in here.

209
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:27,300
Get. Why can't I get out? Shit. Give me the golden egg. That golden egg's not getting out of here.

210
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,500
I will fight you to the death to keep that golden egg in here.

211
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:44,920
Don't let him get that golden egg. Stop him. Good job. Okay. Orange team has eight.

212
00:50:46,119 --> 00:51:04,280
I'll let him take that golden egg out. What are they doing this? 23. Stop. They're just

213
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:11,980
pillaging us. Don't let them take them out. Get that back in here. All right. I'm going to,

214
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:21,800
I'm going to hold him. Little bastard. I'm not letting you get away with this one.

215
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:48,039
You lost quite a few there. So what was the deal with what they were? There was no more eggs on

216
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:56,860
the board. So they just desperately tried to invade our nest. It's not going to work.

217
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:14,630
All right. I remember this one. That's the point. I'm going for this one behind me.

218
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:36,280
Count is two. Oh, come on. Good. I'm going to stay right around here.

219
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:49,139
The side is kind of neglected. I told you the side was neglected. Shit. How come you're so good?

220
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:57,769
No, this red guy, the red guy. I'm standing up here. We're going to get his camera. Please

221
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:03,099
camera. Get, come on. Spawn up here. This get swollen up here. Spawn. I'm really, you're not

222
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:43,260
going to do the one spot that nobody is. Come on. I'm trying to help my 34, 35. I'm contributing

223
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:58,090
this game very much. So don't tell me I'm not carried. Yo, you mean I'm the one carrying.

224
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:19,929
I'm responsible for at least 10 points on this team, at least seven, but okay. Let's round that

225
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:35,500
up. I got to get down to the final 10. Again, here we are. Come on. This is it. I got to win

226
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:48,710
one of these. What's the final event? Ball mountain. Reach the top of the mountain in first

227
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:54,789
and use R T to grab the crown. Reach the top of the mountain. All right. I'm going straight

228
00:54:54,789 --> 00:55:07,239
up the middle. Grab the crown. All right. Right at the middle or hard left going right side.

229
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,619
Holy shit. Nobody went right. It was a brilliant idea. Can I jump over this?

230
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:32,489
You're going to go, I'm going to get it. I'm going to get that crap.

231
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:39,320
Did that just hit me after the fact? That's okay. I'm still in it.

232
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:49,960
Oh, somebody fucking got it. Why did I get hit by the ball? The ball landed over me.

233
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:09,320
Okay. I got hit by the ball that landed like 10 feet behind me. That was a buck. Oh,

234
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:23,820
kind of like Patrick though. Wait. Oh, that was kind of cool. Watermelon. Now I'm going to be

235
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:45,500
watermelon. Watermelon Patrick. Lightning melon. Yeah. No. Purple is based. I want to do

236
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:52,699
watermelon. Wait. Watermelon's not this. What is a watermelon? That's watermelon, right? Yeah.

237
00:56:53,420 --> 00:57:08,920
Do I have enough to do anything? 1300 featured items. It can be a hamburger. Get kudos. Boxer,

238
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:21,610
fish. Oh, I kind of want to be the baseball guy. Help him. Help him. Help him. Buy gems.

239
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:45,340
Baseball is top tier. You have $20,000. Spend five. I hold on. Let me. If I do this,

240
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:52,739
how much should I get? I get small kudos, large kudos. No, but I don't want to just buy a bunch

241
00:57:52,739 --> 00:58:03,429
of shit. Small fall guys. Cool. Small kudos bundle. It's $10. Should I do it? All right.

242
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:11,130
I'm doing it. I do it. No. Well, everyone wanted me to do. Everyone said to do this.

243
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:17,739
Just earn the kudos. Yeah. I'm not buying anything. No. You know what? You guys almost

244
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:28,730
just got me to buy shit. All right. How do I? Is there a bigger menu? It's like a DLC store,

245
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:34,420
but where's the, I mean, regular items? Where's is this? Is this it? That's, is this how you get?

246
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:44,260
Or do you have to like buy it in the DLC store? Oh, it just rotates. Okay. Well, I need more

247
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:57,099
money. And this is a watermelon. Just refreshes. Oh, okay. What do you mean? No. I mean, the lines

248
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:14,219
are a little too dark, but it was by the DLC. I don't just to have like a hamburger. Did I get

249
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:24,820
helmet on? The outside of a watermelon is not red. Yeah. I, I know. Why am I the weird guy?

250
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:43,449
Because I'm talking about the outside of a watermelon. Watermelon. Okay. Yeah. I'm,

251
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:49,510
that's right. It's just a little too dark. Hold on. I gotta go. Um, it's just a little dark. It

252
00:59:49,510 --> 01:00:02,630
needs to be green, like dark green. Just going to follow it. All right. I made up all the time. I

253
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:08,699
lost. It's not red on the outside. It's red on the inside. If you smashed me in the head with a

254
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:21,659
mallet, maybe I would open up and be red. Just follow it. Don't fight it. Just follow it.

255
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:41,369
See him had his hands out. He was like, I'm going to get you, you asshole. What happened? It was a

256
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:49,610
jump. I had to jump over that. Don't fall through the little butt crack there, please.

257
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,989
I can't get eliminated in the first round. You know what I mean? Like I can't.

258
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:17,059
I was too busy looking up watermelons. Whatever. I'm so, this game is so addicting because you,

259
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:20,739
I just want to win one, but it's probably never going to happen. That's how they keep you here.

260
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:26,710
You desperately want to just win one time, but it's probably not going to happen.

261
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:37,219
You'll come close, but you'll never win. I think that's just the BR marketing scheme.

262
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:43,400
Just make people come really, really close to winning every single time, but they never do.

263
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:55,480
So they keep you there. It's gambling. Yeah. It's just sitting at a slot machine. You,

264
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:03,159
you put in like 10 bucks, you lose five, you win 10, you lose four, you win two, you lose eight,

265
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:18,920
you win. It's just a slot machine. Don't get hit by the debris. All right. Which one? I'm going

266
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:30,539
in the middle. Nope. Nope. Oh shit. I didn't think it was going to be real. All right. Right.

267
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:48,059
That's fine. We just have to call desk qualify. Don't matter. It's 42 of us all in the same spot.

268
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,219
It's just who's lucky enough to walk by first.

269
01:02:55,239 --> 01:03:24,309
It's black Friday. Oh, that's another watermelon. I have to win one of these.

270
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,750
Keep your balls in your area to earn points. Keep. So we have to keep our balls in

271
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:39,000
our area. So the goal, I'm going to be on offense. I just, just like a game of soccer,

272
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,199
I'm going to go on offense and I'm going to go like, I'm going to go drop, kick the goalie.

273
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:47,000
Okay. Here we go. Ready? I'm going to get red ball. It's red. They don't expect like three of

274
01:03:47,000 --> 01:04:00,329
us to come get red. I didn't expect that. I got it. Just keep it over here. I'm going to go get a

275
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:05,539
blue ball or a red one. Blue. Nope. I'm going to, there's nobody over here at this red one writer.

276
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:09,829
I'm going for this one. There's only two people on red, two people on yellow. Let's go for it.

277
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,059
On the side, side, side, side. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. On the side.

278
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:35,349
Good. Keep it going. Excellent. Okay. They don't have any. I just feel like I'm playing rescue.

279
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:39,500
You play with three or four friends and one of them instantly just hates the whole game

280
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,340
and is destroyed. Like, yeah, dude, you picked Australia and I came over from Europe and fucking

281
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:52,199
just blacked you out. And now you have to watch us have to spend the next four hours trying to

282
01:04:52,199 --> 01:05:03,780
fight each other. Although late game, having that Australia zone, that's two, that's two units

283
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,110
every run. That's a strategic location to have in risk. No one's even paying attention to me.

284
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:27,179
We're going to get it fucking eliminated. Hi. It's tight. I mean, over time. How did red get all

285
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:58,969
these? What happened? You were too busy talking. We're just running into each other. Last time I

286
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:04,889
checked guys, you don't play the game of chess by you smushing all of your pieces into all of my

287
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:24,059
pieces. And whoever has more pieces on the board in 30 seconds wins the game. That's how you play

288
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:35,300
chess. The guy that picked Australia won. It's actually like a really annoying place to have.

289
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:43,050
You put your troops on that, that little zone there. It's so impossible. You just put like 500

290
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:49,619
units right in the entrance. You just have Australia the whole time. Let me, I gotta get to like the top

291
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:58,550
10 again. Last game is so nerve wrecking. When are they going to have the DLC where I can just

292
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:04,440
pay to be in the final 10? You know, when are they going to invent the Disney fast pass

293
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:11,659
of this game? Right. It's like, Oh, 13 people have been eliminated and we've got one that just joined

294
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:16,539
the fall guy fast pass. You'd be hated when you, everyone would just gang up on you.

295
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:43,059
What's even possible to do this DNQ did not qualify in the first round.

296
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,159
Unless somebody does something real dumb. Like that guy, the guy that you just watched. Yeah,

297
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:53,400
like dude, you and me get it. We get it. Like we're the only two that aren't going to qualify.

298
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:15,110
We'll just be a fruit salad together. Is this guy disconnected? Oh, he's back. How is this still

299
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:31,750
possible? Why is it still going? Wait, I just have to beat the pineapple guy. You're throwing

300
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:43,689
for views. No, I got trapped in that windmill. I could have made it. I just was sitting there

301
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:47,800
talking to the pineapple guy and he freaked out. You know what probably happened? The guy was

302
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:52,600
probably sleeping in his chair with his pretzels on his crotch and he was just hanging out, just

303
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:05,739
stoned. And when I grabbed him, his controller vibrated and he freaked out. Whoa. Whoa. Oh,

304
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:15,449
shit. It's just drool is all over the side of his mouth. And embarrassingly he looks over and there's

305
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:19,130
a puddle of just wetness right next to his head and he just fucking puts a blanket on it. I don't

306
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:43,430
want anyone to see that. It's embarrassing. I am going to qualify this time. I'm going to just be

307
01:09:43,430 --> 01:10:12,489
quiet. Quiet. No, we put too much weight on it. Why don't we just all keep it? There's a bunch

308
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:16,569
of people waiting for this to come down, but we just keep ruining it. We just keep making it too low.

309
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:49,609
No, I don't want to do it. Oh, not yet. Okay, go now. Are you trying to kill us? Only 10 people

310
01:10:49,609 --> 01:11:13,670
have made it so far. It's penis music. I hate that I get it now. But you know what I'm saying?

311
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:19,529
I hate that I get it. Like how the hell do I get penis music? I'm not supposed to get that.

312
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:46,170
I'm trying to drag this guy over the finish line so he stops doing this. All right, man. You don't

313
01:11:46,170 --> 01:12:01,289
have to build a farm all the way in the corner of the map. I already took your castle. Nobody

314
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:21,579
gets that shit? No, we played Warcraft 3 online back in 2002. I forgot. It's too old. I want the

315
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:31,479
soda can one. I hate this one. I mean, you could just ask the audience and just go to where most

316
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:49,960
people are standing, but sometimes the audience gets it wrong. This is boomer fruit, but eating

317
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:55,050
a banana is a boomer thing. Like eating. All right. I know what that man in the right hand

318
01:12:55,050 --> 01:13:08,279
and the grapes right there. This is right, right? Come on, dude. Come on. Why push him off? Why push

319
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:12,920
him off? That was so, that wasn't even called for. That guy's probably so sad right now. He got it

320
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:21,239
right and he lost. Oranges, watermelons. Okay. Orange, watermelon, banana. I know what they are.

321
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,659
What's the, it's a, I didn't, there was a cherry.

322
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:43,819
I'm on the edge. I don't like being on the edge. Hey, all right. What is it?

323
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:49,050
Cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry,

324
01:13:49,050 --> 01:14:12,149
banana, orange, watermelon, cherry. This is where the grapes. Holy shit. I don't think anybody lost.

325
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:27,779
Oh, that guy did. Oh yeah. That's the guy we would have all made it, but somebody pushed him

326
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:35,609
off the edge. And that motherfucker was on camera. You know, we saw it happen. All right.

327
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:41,539
This is the egg one. I don't like this one. It's too long. I'm going right for a gold egg though.

328
01:14:41,539 --> 01:15:16,460
Golden egg. Get that golden egg, please. Good. Nice. Nice work. I'll take that egg from you.

329
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:30,630
Don't just defend. What? Holy shit. Another golden goose. Just block the game of football.

330
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:51,720
That's all this is. Don't let him get back you. Oh shit. That guy just had, he just gave them like

331
01:15:51,720 --> 01:16:18,329
10 points. Get it in there. Nice work. Blue can take it. Blue has nothing. Okay. I'm all right

332
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:27,189
with this. Just defend. Get that D, get that D, the D, the D. They're going to try to get out

333
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:51,340
and just fucking stop them. Wow. Completely unguarded. This is a mistake. Defensive genius.

334
01:16:52,060 --> 01:17:02,680
Defensive genius. What's up, sir? All right. We got two more, right? I gotta beat one of these.

335
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:16,680
You can throw eggs by diving, letting go. Yeah. Don't choke. Depends on what this is. Fruit shoot.

336
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:25,399
Dodge the flying fruit. Okay. You got to pick a side and just commit to dodging and not try to be

337
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:58,260
first. All right. I was already down. I had damage mitigation. Pretty good dodge right there. See

338
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:41,289
the little shimmy? No. Fucking plum. Yes. Spent right by him. That was the worst noise.

339
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:52,170
That was a car. I don't know. I'm ready to win. This is the last event. I got to win. All right.

340
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:57,989
Super mountain. I hate this shit. Someone's always better than you. The number one rule of BR is

341
01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:03,270
somebody's always better than you. No matter what. There's always three people better than you in

342
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:18,439
every game. Watch out for those balls. There's one coming. They don't even look.

343
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,180
I'm never going to win. You can't win. There's no winning in this game.

344
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:56,500
You don't win. There's no winning. Somebody's always going to be in first place in front of

345
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:08,710
you. This is the carrot on a stick. They make sure the carrot's still there so you buy a bunch of

346
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:29,619
fucking kudos bars. Wait. I got a crown. Oh shit. I want it. What am I going to do with the crown?

347
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:44,680
Stealthy. Ooh. Boxer. I'm going to save my crown. I don't want. Yeah. I'm saving the crown.

348
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:50,420
Let's go put this on though. Okay. What do I get? Upper. Yes.

349
01:20:51,140 --> 01:21:28,470
All right. I need to change to my favorite colors. The Boston Red Sox. All right. That's fine.

350
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:36,840
No pattern. I'm just going to be. Yeah. I'm going to be pink. Finally. I can stand out.

351
01:21:49,770 --> 01:22:05,079
That's like Peter Griffin. I'm stopping doing that. Anytime you go like

352
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:10,840
that. That's Peter Griffin doing a funny song. I can't do that.

353
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,039
There are 10k people. Yeah. There are. Holy shit. There are 10k people here. Hey.

354
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:26,020
You think I'll be able to beat this new fall guys? Or do I have to come back and do this

355
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:35,180
tomorrow and try to win before I do anything else in my entire life? Like I have to win once.

356
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:56,890
They're keeping me in the casino. I have to win. Someone is as unique as me.

357
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:10,010
All right. Stop trying to go up down. I was waiting too. I was waiting and I didn't even

358
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:31,340
get it. I'm now I'm stuck forever. I'm actually not in a bad spot somehow. I just got destroyed.

359
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:55,460
All right. I'm not going up the middle. I have to be safe quickly. Quickly. I was just in the road.

360
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:00,949
Oh my fucking God. I'm so mad right now. We were all waiting at the bus stop. And for some reason,

361
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:08,920
I was waiting on the road and we were in the highway. I still did it. 36.

362
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:16,840
That guy right there. That that that chocolate mint sprinkles guy is probably so mad that he

363
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:33,779
didn't go over. He was making it his job to fuck everybody up. That dude just had both hands

364
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:38,979
over and over again. He's just smashing his fucking desk over and over again. Both hands

365
01:24:38,979 --> 01:25:16,060
projecting. Whatever. Too many. Too many. Only 30 people can qualify. This is not good.

366
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:28,250
No. But we have to go to the how we do this. We just lose. Stop doing it. I'm going the other way.

367
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:31,529
I'm going the other way. You guys are stupid waiting for the bus.

368
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:37,479
The bus is always going to come on this side. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Everybody's like,

369
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:50,699
oh, wait, maybe we should do that too. Hey, what does that do? Why is this? Why am I? Why

370
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:59,880
have a cursor on me? Why am I selected? Somebody about to drop like a nuke on me was I don't

371
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:36,760
understand. What's this for? No. Excuse me. They all just spun on top of me. Oh, come on.

372
01:26:37,960 --> 01:27:00,140
It's too slippery and we can't do it. That just saved me. Is this six of us?

373
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,899
Really liked getting telephragged by eight people that all respond in front of me.

374
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:27,430
Hand desk with both hands and fucking scream.

375
01:27:32,220 --> 01:28:06,859
pretzels are everywhere. Oh, CBD. Nobody listened to that guy. Liar. And he's just trying to fucking

376
01:28:06,859 --> 01:28:22,119
mess with me. And he's trying to defame me. First round is always not the worst.

377
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,159
Always the easiest. Why can't they all be like this?

378
01:28:27,529 --> 01:28:53,479
Why did I fall? I was just running. I want to be dumb. Why are these people all getting thrown

379
01:28:53,479 --> 01:29:08,149
over here? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Yeah. Target the streamer. Yeah. That wicked funny.

380
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:13,739
Yeah. Of course. Right. Yup. Says German on a five up there. Yeah. Grab me. Target the streamer.

381
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:31,800
Nobody can even tell who is who. Right. Doesn't even say your name.

382
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:47,449
This might sound really weird. Don't you want to see these people?

383
01:29:48,569 --> 01:29:54,840
This is the greatest compilation box of jelly bellies ever.

384
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,720
By the way, what happened to jelly? Jelly bellies could have really, really stepped a game up.

385
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:14,010
They decided just not to. It's been the same gross peanut butter flavor. No, no, no. Butter

386
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:22,060
flavored throw up smell induced vomit jelly beans forever. Buttered popcorn. Like if you eat that.

387
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:31,819
I'm sorry. I can't understand how they could have said like 14 words out of order.

388
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:42,600
You know what I mean though? Butter popcorn jelly bellies are just there. I feel like they're

389
01:30:42,600 --> 01:31:06,390
only in there for people to make like jokes about. I don't, I don't like them. Don't all do the same

390
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:25,960
thing at once. All right. I'm safe for now. It's going faster. It's the worst thing to pick. Wait.

391
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:31,000
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.

392
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:47,180
Oh boy. Oh boy. Like jump on this one. Oh no, I shouldn't have done that. Okay. I'm good.

393
01:31:48,779 --> 01:32:06,390
Like I really fucked up, but he's still alive. Why are we so good? We're all like the 11 year

394
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:26,760
olds that fall instantly. Come on. Are we all 30? Yeah, I think so. Probably fall off. Somebody

395
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,920
fall off. Somebody fall. There's only two more people need to fall. Fall.

396
01:32:37,989 --> 01:32:48,340
Oh shit. All right. One more. We're good. Yes. It's kind of sad, but this game is

397
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:59,300
all like 30 year olds and we all think that everybody else is 10. I never thought about it

398
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:17,909
like that. Why can't we just have fun? Yeah. Why does it matter? That doesn't matter. Just

399
01:33:17,909 --> 01:33:26,970
why can't we just have a good time? No, no fun. I don't like this one.

400
01:33:28,699 --> 01:33:46,869
But all right. I got that off. I got that off you. Am I fucking this up? I think I'm

401
01:33:46,869 --> 01:33:51,750
fucking this up. I might be messing this up for us. I'm like throwing them and they're bouncing back.

402
01:33:55,079 --> 01:34:03,130
Get the golden egg. All right. We've got more blue over here. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

403
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:18,859
Get it in there. Good. Good. Okay. Back in the game. How much is a gold egg worth?

404
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:22,380
No. Are we going to be the team that everybody comes and just ruins?

405
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:36,119
No. I'll be defense. Fine. Get eggs in here. I'm defending this place with my fucking life guys.

406
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:59,210
Call me. Oh my God. We're so bad. This is awful. This is so bad. What do I do?

407
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:10,680
What am I supposed to do? We lose. It's over. We couldn't even get one egg to stay here.

408
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:40,229
I'll be the only guy that has one egg. What do you mean toxic? That wasn't toxic.

409
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:57,909
It was zero seconds left. Toxic. You could have won. We had two points. The people in second place

410
01:35:57,909 --> 01:36:11,529
had 21. Am I going to play Minecraft today? No. Probably not going to play Minecraft for another

411
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:16,010
year. That's not true. FTK is happening in like two weeks. Sorry about that. Never mind.

412
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:26,619
Only three weeks or something. Oh, I want to make sure I say this. If you,

413
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:33,640
the reason why the DLC movie night was going to be the end of August is because when I,

414
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,329
I didn't really give anybody a cutoff date. I did that stream and then disappeared for two

415
01:36:38,329 --> 01:36:45,300
and a half months. So now on the 23rd, that's the last time you can submit anything and please go

416
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:57,779
check out the rules. What? I got banned? No, I didn't. Am I in low priority queue? What happened?

417
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:27,739
I didn't get actually banned. Did I? No. Good. All right. I got to focus. I'm just going to put

418
01:37:27,739 --> 01:37:54,550
on focus music. Uh, I, I got it. I'll do it after this. You got to go with the flow with these.

419
01:37:56,149 --> 01:38:15,670
Okay. Sick. All right. Well, I'm going this way. Don't fire. Don't fire. Don't fire. Good.

420
01:38:19,859 --> 01:38:38,090
Epic. Oh my God. This is so epic. Stop diving. I can't help it. I'm sorry.

421
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:59,109
That guy was just wanted to go. He didn't want anything to do with that.

422
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:04,520
You see looking at how, but what flavor would that guy be? That guy would be like this weird

423
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:13,500
raspberry cotton candy and shit. This would be like licorice, uh, mint, watermelon. They don't

424
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:18,140
have, they have all those flavors. What other flavors would you add? They have all these,

425
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,539
every single one of these could be a flavor. They have it in Jelly Belly.

426
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:39,979
I don't switch the subject. You're toxic. Yeah. You want to see toxic? I'll show you toxic.

427
01:40:01,689 --> 01:40:07,109
Everyone just waiting with just clenched. Oh, what's he going to do? He's going to look wicked.

428
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:10,310
Fucked up. No, I don't give a shit. I'm just playing the game.

429
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:53,340
He like shook me off a little and I was, I was holding up on the

430
01:40:53,979 --> 01:41:05,560
controller thinking he would go off. I'm fucking smashing my hand. Okay. I have to, I need focus

431
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,250
music. I don't even know what focus music is right now. I don't know. Like a dial tone.

432
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:30,260
Why can I not hear this? Why can't I hear that? I can't hear it. You can.

433
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:45,369
What's the first thing you think about when you want to focus? Um,

434
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:58,869
first thing that I want to focus on is the first thing. Um, energy, like body energy.

435
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:11,529
Not, uh, not anything too loud or. Oh, no, no, no. I just, just, just body energy, body heat.

436
01:42:11,529 --> 01:42:13,930
That's what I think of when I think of like, well, how do you focus body heat?

437
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:32,470
Is there a song like, or the thing that, okay, body heat. How about Halloween farts three?

438
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:52,600
That's not a real song. And that's, I mean, maybe it is. Why is it Halloween? What's the

439
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:57,159
difference between a Halloween fart and a Christmas fart? I think I did the both the same thing.

440
01:42:58,699 --> 01:43:14,220
Did you put one through an echo filter with like a pitch shift on it? He needs to center his chi.

441
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:17,659
All right. I hate this one. This one's too easy just to blow up and just lose.

442
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:39,779
Where do you think you're going? Back off.

443
01:43:46,329 --> 01:43:50,409
All right. Now defense. Click the link coward. I'm in the middle of a,

444
01:43:50,409 --> 01:43:54,649
of a battle Royale where every second counts. I can't click on the link right now.

445
01:43:54,649 --> 01:44:00,420
Oh, and somebody just stole a golden goose from us. All right. I got,

446
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:05,140
there's two eggs over here. I got to start fighting. Just grab somebody.

447
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:23,770
Good. Don't be in last place. All right. That's good. Just defend. No one's paying attention.

448
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:33,979
Wrong guy. Oh no, they're all coming in. They're all coming in. They're all coming in our zone.

449
01:44:34,380 --> 01:45:03,699
Hey, why is everybody standing around? 19 seconds. We're good. No, that's not. That's one of my

450
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:22,869
friends. Okay. All of blue team is in the red base. We did it. Toxic team kill. All right.

451
01:45:22,869 --> 01:45:29,319
What do you want me to click? Why can I not hear this though? That's annoying.

452
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:49,720
Nobody just uploaded this. Somebody just uploaded this or they just titled something differently.

453
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:52,760
This is Halloween farts three. How is this? What does it mean to do with farting?

454
01:45:53,640 --> 01:46:05,430
I don't understand. Wait, soccer. All right. All right. Let's go. I just fucked it up for

455
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:28,100
everybody. I just ruined everything. What? Pretty good shot. All right. Line it up. Bounce it over

456
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:53,750
here. I know that they did this. I know they did this in soccer. Watch this. Get it in there.

457
01:46:55,210 --> 01:47:24,300
Now they're in trouble. Four to one. It's going to double. Get it in. Nice. I set that up.

458
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:33,510
I set that up big time. Good setup. This is bad. Blue is kind of getting destroyed.

459
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,119
Just whatever. No, no. Don't go chase it. We're up by six points.

460
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:46,069
Don't go chasing it. Where's the goalie? Oh, somebody's screaming right now.

461
01:47:47,909 --> 01:48:00,649
I'm going to bounce back this way. Watch. I'm going to head it in there. Thank you.

462
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:27,699
Yes. Come on. Do it. Yes. No. We got to get to 10 points. Wow. That was an across the 11.

463
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:35,300
This is just sad. How come a bunch of them didn't leave like I did? Are they not children like I am?

464
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:55,239
Damn. There's only nine people. There's like an 11% chance that I just win just because I exist.

465
01:48:55,239 --> 01:49:31,560
This is awesome. Okay. I'm going to let them bump their heads. Not mine.

466
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:53,189
I'm going to hit that toucan up there. Get hit. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. He's going to

467
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:55,270
miss. He's going to miss. Watch this. He's going to miss. He's not going to get it. He's going to

468
01:49:55,270 --> 01:50:38,090
miss. I hate this game. Pigeon? Sure. Put it on. I'm the Toronto Blue Jays. Cool. I like it.

469
01:50:50,859 --> 01:50:57,109
Why would I play the Halloween album again? I'm trying to find out where there are parts.

470
01:50:57,109 --> 01:51:13,739
It's just every haunted house I've ever been to. There's nothing there. Wait. What? Wait.

471
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:20,010
Oh no. I've had wrong audio. I've had fucked up audio the whole stream.

472
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:30,970
Yep. My audio has been completely toast the entire stream. So I have a pair of headphones

473
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:34,729
that I have an extender for. That extender, for some reason, when I plug the headphones

474
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:39,609
into the extender, if it's not just right, it can really just screw up the entire audio.

475
01:51:40,409 --> 01:51:43,609
We have muffled and shitty sounding and I feel like wiggle it around a little.

476
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:50,630
So it actually, I cannot hear what's going on there. I feel like wiggle the thing around.

477
01:51:52,390 --> 01:52:13,460
Wait. Don't fall for that. Is that not true?

478
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:18,420
That really is a problem that I have and it looked like it wasn't plugged in all the way.

479
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:29,819
Oh, this is you guys are just fucking around. Oh, okay. So one of you just made this and

480
01:52:29,899 --> 01:52:54,569
uploaded it. Oh, this video was uploaded in 2015. Let's see who comes in.

481
01:52:55,449 --> 01:52:59,539
I'm going to try to ruin somebody's day. I'm going to try to be 41.

482
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:10,470
Is that toxic? Now I'm going to watch the guy just desperately coming and I'm going to just

483
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:17,539
walk over right when he gets right here. Is it toxic? Isn't that just part of like the

484
01:53:17,539 --> 01:53:39,100
jelly bean game? That's what you, I can do this. It's toxic. I saw that right side over there.

485
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:47,130
There was like 10 people. So I'm like, no, I'm not. All right. This guy right here is doing it.

486
01:53:47,130 --> 01:54:00,380
Let's see if he gets it. 37. No, where is he? Oh, I'll be a coward in that scenario. That's fine.

487
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:13,979
But on calming Fortnite music, I have to like turn the music off on this.

488
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:43,100
What is calming Fortnite music? Fortnite has a soundtrack. It does. It has a soundtrack.

489
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:45,500
But yeah, but is it something that people like actually listen to?

490
01:54:45,500 --> 01:55:06,409
No. Why is this left one not going down ever again?

491
01:55:08,409 --> 01:55:23,909
You saw that. What the hell was that? All right. I, that was stupid.

492
01:55:23,909 --> 01:55:28,149
The thing stayed up with five rotations. All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

493
01:55:28,949 --> 01:55:40,810
I'll put on the Fortnite song. What is it? Where's the, where's the Fortnite song?

494
01:55:40,810 --> 01:55:56,100
No, that's why my BRB. Preston. Fortnite music, the calm before the storm.

495
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:06,359
Is this going to work? Uh, go back. What am I doing? Okay. Let's

496
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:22,649
Relaxing gaming music, Fortnite OST. This is not haunted house music. This sounds like Halloween

497
01:56:22,649 --> 01:56:53,939
music. I'm going to get a DMCA from Fortnite. What? Really? Okay. No music. Just only my breath.

498
01:56:53,939 --> 01:57:08,869
That's all you're going to get. No, people are going to hate that. That's not funny.

499
01:57:08,869 --> 01:57:11,270
That's just people. Like a thousand of you believe if I do that.

500
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:31,340
All right. I got to pay attention. I have to come in first. Why does this guy have the same clothes

501
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:37,939
on? That's always the worst thing in the world. You go to a Halloween party and you hope to God

502
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:46,100
that nobody else has the, I'm the adult, the adult doctor costume thing on the bag and two other

503
01:57:46,100 --> 01:58:01,220
people at the party have the like nurse bag costume. What do you mean? Huh? You go to a

504
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:04,739
Halloween party and somebody's wearing the same costume that they got it out of the bag from the

505
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:18,020
like the party store. Like the costume is in a bag. Nobody understand what I'm saying.

506
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:27,750
When you go to a Halloween party and everyone's dressed up and a bunch of those people there got

507
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:33,659
their Halloween costume 40 minutes before the party and they got it out of a bag. It's just a

508
01:58:33,659 --> 01:58:44,100
bag. It's got a hat, a little thing for a mask, a suit. Uh, it's just a bag costume. I know what

509
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:53,779
he said. Yeah. Wow. Why is this so bizarre? Have you guys ever been into a party store in your entire

510
01:58:53,779 --> 01:59:00,739
life? You know how they have just the wall of just pre-made ready to go, just costumes in the bag.

511
01:59:00,739 --> 01:59:23,579
I'm getting trolled here. What is a party store? This stuff still exists. This doesn't like something

512
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:31,369
from like the forties. This is a, the bag costume and it's Wolverine and the, the legs,

513
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:36,979
the pants are so short that they end up being like Capri's. You get like a shitty Wolverine

514
01:59:36,979 --> 01:59:43,779
mask that covers half of the top part of your face. And for some reason, the arms are so baggy.

515
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:59,859
I've worn them before. It doesn't even come claws. I was in a good position until I got hit.

516
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:06,979
Okay. I'm just, what RNG is this? I'm getting hit by every single fucking one of these.

517
02:00:07,539 --> 02:00:29,180
It's the music. I need music. What can I put on for music? That's not going to get my channel

518
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:36,659
fucking terminated. Am I going to have to make my own music to listen to on stream?

519
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:48,470
But on the Tekken 4 OST. All right. Now you're talking. I don't even know what this is.

520
02:00:52,550 --> 02:01:00,100
Damn it. I want to play this one. Not fair. This one looks so cool. Tekken 4 full soundtrack.

521
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:19,560
This one looks fun. Have I ever seen that one? I had a shot at that honeycomb level and I really

522
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:31,689
blew it. I'm so sad. I'm going to get DMCA'd by Tekken. Not, that's not going to happen.

523
02:01:31,689 --> 02:01:58,600
This is pretty perfect gaming music. Louder. It sounds like I just grabbed, this is right in the

524
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:23,819
middle of a drum solo. Oh, these sounds ruin it. No, you can't even hear it. I'll fix it.

525
02:02:24,619 --> 02:02:48,869
Let's keep the momentum going. Everyone's going to be fine. Play Gex? I don't know what that is.

526
02:02:53,180 --> 02:03:00,060
Shit. Shit. Shit. No, no, no, no. Don't. Please. I was the last motherfucker to cross

527
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:20,729
that finish line. All right. How do I put Gex? Please don't. Don't. That's actually going to get

528
02:03:20,729 --> 02:03:41,140
me in trouble. Okay. This is just what happens when the DJ is setting up his shit. He hasn't

529
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:51,829
started doing anything yet. He doesn't start for another 15 minutes. Never play 100 Gex. It's awful.

530
02:03:51,829 --> 02:04:11,579
