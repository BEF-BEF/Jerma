1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,419
Okay, so the next one I'm gonna move to, and I'm only gonna... I'm like drained already.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,660
The next one I'm moving to is probably gonna have this, but just about 5,000 people here.

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:26,820
Probably about, probably 1,600 of you are gonna leave. I'll show you why. I saw it on

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,379
Steam, I had to buy it, even though it's probably gonna be terrible. I don't know, it might be

5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:52,740
good. No, it's not Picross VR. Take a snapshot, okay? I'm serious. How many people are here

6
00:00:52,740 --> 00:01:09,109
right now versus how many people are here in five minutes? Okay, let's see. Opening it now.

7
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,629
Change the title. Why? It says my own reality, playing games and demos. That's what we're

8
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:47,060
doing. Get out of Minecraft. Okay, and here we go. I apologize everybody, but it had to be done.

9
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:41,879
This is Rick and Morty of Virtual Rick-ality. Can you guys even see this? All right, I'm

10
00:02:41,879 --> 00:03:03,509
ready now for a Rick and Morty. Look at that tension. How do I do anything? What do I do?

11
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:09,860
This is, this is, this is really awful. You couldn't make this quote out of fucking Jello

12
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:37,740
or something. Big disc. Do Rick's laundry. That's unplayable. And no, I don't mean the

13
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:54,460
game. I mean the headset. You wanna see a fucking magic trick? Oh shit! I probably just

14
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:11,050
made everybody throw. I'm so sorry. I have to sit here and let this unwind. Oh my god.

15
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:26,199
It's so tight back here. How does it even get like this? All right, let it spin. Come on,

16
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:45,540
let's go. Get in! There. There we go. Now I can spin. I physically couldn't even turn it.

17
00:04:48,089 --> 00:05:01,420
Bunched up. Finally. My god. Can have, take like a powder break. Someone has to come

18
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:22,569
in here and powder my face, untangle my cord. That's fun. It is though. This is way too

19
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:35,459
fucking loud. All right, here we go. All right, let's come back. I'm sorry if I made

20
00:05:35,459 --> 00:06:09,620
you almost throw up there, because I almost did too. Okay, do Rick's laundry. Hey,

21
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:34,009
look, we're ready to play a video game. Let's go. Rick and Morty. Okay. Can't wait to

22
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:59,779
hear more like made up words. Why am I playing this? Because this is my out.

23
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,620
Because this is my way out. Minecraft VR, I'm out of gas and this is my way out.

24
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,879
You'll be begging me to turn the stream off in about 20 minutes.

25
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,699
It's me, Morty!

26
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,480
You'll see I wrote instructions on what you're supposed to do.

27
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:53,610
This looks like when the Simpsons went into 3D and it looked weird. Okay.

28
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:57,339
How do I move?

29
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:17,860
You can drink. You want some? Right in your fucking eyes. Oh, look at this. It's

30
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,459
our dirty underwear! Oh, what the fuck? How do I move?

31
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:43,379
I don't know how to move. Morty, how do I move?

32
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:06,360
Dude, the physics engine fucking fell back. No, I'll take something. Oh,

33
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
okay, one. I thought I wanted me to put it in the...

34
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:37,220
Morty, listen to me. Listen to me, Morty. Morty, listen to me. I got it. I need that.

35
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,860
Your shot asides your blog from the Simpsons. I figured it out.

36
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,779
Lawsuit!

37
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,110
Do it again.

38
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:33,909
Thank you.

39
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,509
I'm gonna need you to grab the watch and put it on your wrist.

40
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,230
You'll be able to call me using the watch. This is very important.

41
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,950
All right, Morty clone? All right, Morty clone, we gotta go.

42
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,470
Don't touch any of my stuff while we're gone.

43
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,490
What's this one called? Rick, wait. I think I can figure it out.

44
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:12,250
That's the Schmeichel box. That's the Floggin' Flaggin' Blagger, right?

45
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:17,659
This is the Groobin' Grubbin' Globbaglover, right? Something like that.

46
00:11:19,210 --> 00:12:01,879
Oh, and this is just a crown, Morty. Hey. Hey, I'm Mr. Basics.

47
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:37,690
Look at me. No. No, I didn't. No. What? Look at me. Everybody did that. Come on.

48
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,940
That was fucking actually kind of brutal.

49
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,080
Give me another one. Give me another one. Give me another one. Give me another one.

50
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,279
How many can I have? Let's say I have like five.

51
00:12:52,919 --> 00:13:16,309
I can only have four. Okay, so what do you want to do?

52
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:27,289
What the fuck just happened? All right, so what do you want to do? Call me?

53
00:13:49,620 --> 00:14:24,090
Got it. Throw it to me. What just happened? Like this. Like this.

54
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:46,809
Okay, what do you order me another one? I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry.

55
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,639
Why did you die? All right, what does it want me to do?

56
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:34,710
What the fuck? That just makes you small? Okay. All right, give me something, right?

57
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:45,539
Give me an order something. What does it want me to do? Turn up the game audio.

58
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:57,830
It's already pretty high. Please don't. What did I have to do? He wanted me to...

59
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:08,009
I don't remember what he wanted me to do. Nitro dark matter.

60
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,940
No, you actually. All right, hold on.

61
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,830
Okay, what was the actual goal? He said, uh, order me. Order me. What was it?

62
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:51,080
To use the phone.

63
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:30,039
Oh, what? Oh, it broke. Rick, your computer's broken.

64
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:58,789
RAM, CPU, GPU. Got it. Okay, RAM goes in there. What is this? Crystal. It's broken. And then,

65
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:10,819
fuse. Okay, use that to get fuse. Don't forget he has RAM. Okay, so don't forget he has RAM

66
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:30,059
down there and down here. That's carrots. You just spit that back into my mouth.

67
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:54,309
I need to make a carrot hammer. Carrot hammer. I can use that portal machine.

68
00:18:54,309 --> 00:19:19,960
What was the portal machine for? Use to get fuse. Wow. We're looking at Earth.

69
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:39,670
I need to charge the battery. With what? With a Super Nintendo game? How about one of you?

70
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:09,880
All right, charge the battery. Charging station or something in here.

71
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:36,259
Can't pass the IQ gear check. I'm actually just exhausted for some reason.

72
00:20:36,660 --> 00:21:55,579
I don't know why. Charge it. That's pretty close to Jerma's son. I did it. This is stressing

73
00:21:55,579 --> 00:22:26,869
me out. Goodbye. I got a battery for you. Battery. Open. I got him. Two fuses. Done.

74
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:47,509
It's in. All right, now I need a crystal. And I need to make a fucking carrot.

75
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,210
A carrot thing. Or a weird apple. Metal apple. How the hell am I gonna make a metal apple?

76
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:33,269
Is it metal? Well, this is a crystal. Do both these. Thank you. Oh, he's eating both. All right.

77
00:23:37,079 --> 00:24:03,450
That looks pretty good. Nope. Not right. I need something else. Screwdriver. Hammer. Hammer.

78
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:20,069
Look out. All right. IP. Rick and Morty's Rick-ality.

79
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:47,099
Boot it up. Now, what do I, what do you want to do with this? Rick?

80
00:25:36,859 --> 00:26:00,980
Okay. Do I get to choose? Oh. I thought I was gonna get a drop down. Into the toilet.

81
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:46,200
Look. I'm just a baby right now. I'm not even talking. I'm just a baby playing with fucking toys.

82
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:41,700
All right. Got it. Plunge the toilet. What, now what? Oh, come on. What? Lactatives.

83
00:27:52,339 --> 00:28:01,769
I need like a, something to fix the toilet. Here we go. This is the toilet fixer thing.

84
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:35,059
Rick, I don't know. Do I do it? What the fuck is this?

85
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:58,730
This. Okay. It's almond. Oh, they're back.

86
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:20,980
Sure thing, Rick. They didn't get it.

87
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:33,900
Why can't you just tell me right now?

88
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,299
So, we're, we're.

89
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,720
There's nothing in there. Can I wear this?

90
00:30:32,940 --> 00:31:07,160
I don't want it on. Do I have to charge this thing in the? Oh, God. Really? I, this is gonna,

91
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:17,000
I have to, I have to end the stream after this one. I'm running out of fumes. I don't

92
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:57,500
know why. I'm so tired. Look at how long this takes though. The fate of the universe is in my

93
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:21,819
fucking hand. One fuck up and his whole thing, the whole planet goes down. Look. Where, where's it?

94
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:57,690
What? What happened? I didn't draw. Help diamond. Help the, on, come on. I actually have to get

95
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:07,720
out of the headset. After I plug in the fucking car, I think it's time for me to go.

96
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:25,700
This is, if you're a fan of the show, this is probably really cool. And yeah, I know this is

97
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,579
the, this is the other VR game I played today, but don't worry, we're gonna come back.

98
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:52,200
I can't fucking hear anything. It's got, you know, I can always tell when it's time for me to

99
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:01,180
stop. When the, my, I'm sweating so much inside of my ears that this thing won't stay in.

100
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,179
It's oiled inside of here. It's oily. And it just keeps falling off. That's how I know it's

101
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:38,659
not. Okay. I'm holding this. Now what? Let's get the repair kit.

102
00:34:45,320 --> 00:35:03,989
Curl 40. How does this thing work? Let's go check it out over here. No, what?

103
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:18,730
Incorrect combination. Please try a little harder. I need to, I need a match. So I green to green.

104
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:39,480
You're at green. It's only one match. It's a lift. Watch out. No more than five bands total.

105
00:35:40,280 --> 00:36:14,150
No more than one blue and at least two reds. No. Do you call that fuckery? So there's one

106
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:22,440
red and here's two. I can't, at least one link with no duplicate colors. So that's this one.

107
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:33,190
No more than five bands total. One, two, three, four, five. And it's got, okay,

108
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:43,079
there's code zone here too. Hold on. One link ending in a number and one ending in a letter.

109
00:36:43,079 --> 00:37:17,369
Oh my God. I need to like see what the, all right. So one has to end in a number,

110
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:51,349
one has to end in a letter. You got yellow, yellow, six, five, I'm done. Oh, oh my God.

111
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:59,099
I'm so tired. Did you enjoy your stay? I, Minecraft VR was really cool. That was cool too.

112
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:12,630
I'm just completely out of fucking steam. I just got nothing in tech. Oh, it's been,

113
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,989
yeah, this, this usually is when it happens around like four and a half hours,

114
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:39,909
just about like four to five hours. Oh yeah. How bad do I look today? Oh, all right. So

115
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:56,460
cold, but no, no cold right now. I look like fucking somebody diarrhea all over me,

116
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:05,579
but that's going to be it. I will see you guys. I'll see you guys in a few days because I'm

117
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:10,809
going to take the next few days off. I've got some things to take care of. I got some friends

118
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:18,150
that came up, so I'm going to see them for a little while. I'll see you guys real soon.

119
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:30,780
We'll do the bits. And as much as like the, I was taking the piss on the Minecraft thing,

120
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,460
but it was actually really, really cool. And it doesn't cost me anything either. That mod is free.

121
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:50,889
I usually, I typically like to go a little bit longer, but no, I got nothing. I'm not going

122
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:59,320
to pretend I do, you know? Anyways, let's go through the bits. Thank you for joining me,

123
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:12,699
everybody. When I get back, we got, I'll be back on probably Wednesday is when the next

124
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:18,460
stream will be. So Wednesday afternoon, we'll be back. Joel and I are going to do our

125
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,159
gamer competition in Pogo Stuck, Pogo Stick, whatever it's called, Pogo Stuck Rage,

126
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:36,460
Pogo Stick Rage. Joel, as in Varg Skeletor. I don't know if that's going to happen on

127
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,219
Wednesday, but we'll be talking back and forth about it. So we'll see. That's going

128
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:46,019
to happen probably next week if we can get our schedules correct. Five community subs,

129
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:52,619
thank you so much. That just came in right now. Those came in from Bingo Sunshine. Thank you so

130
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,179
much. That's a shitload of community subs. People give a lot of community subs on this channel.

131
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:09,909
Every stream is at least like 50. It's insane. But yeah, then there's more. I want to do

132
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:14,230
mine show, but that's going to be a whole stream. I really did not expect Minecraft VR

133
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:22,619
to take up three and a half hours of this stream, but it did somehow. But there are

134
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:29,510
plenty of things lined up. If you're taking off, I'll see you soon. See you on Wednesday.

135
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:38,500
Much love to you. And let's go back to the Cremator. Cremator a few hours ago gave five

136
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:50,980
dollars. Jerma, I see your place in memecraft. Good job. Oh, and I played. Oh, is this the

137
00:41:50,980 --> 00:42:02,010
fire dude again? All right. Well, good luck. I don't, I've already said five piece. Thank

138
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:13,750
you for the five dollars though. Thank you. Alf the librarian for the five dollars. My

139
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:27,460
library filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. That's not good. Your library data. Sorry to hear that.

140
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:32,179
We're liquidating our library because chat stormed in and bought all the good books.

141
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:43,750
Well, at least chat has some reading material. No. Hey, dork cube. Thanks for the 250.

142
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,989
Can't watch the stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of

143
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:54,780
your word. Even if chat kind of sort of cheated at pick Ross. I told you guys I was going to do

144
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:11,670
it. I'm a man of my word sometimes. I like to be a man of my word all the time. I try. Hey,

145
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,750
snoozing copter. Thanks for the 250 snoozing copter. Every time Jerma plays minecraft,

146
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,750
he gets the rarest spawns. I think I don't keep up with minecraft is the ocean thing

147
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,750
rare. But minecraft actually is kind of fun. I should play it again. Nevermind. What I

148
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,630
wanted to ask, I have trouble gaining weight. I'm 21, Jerma. I know you've struggled with

149
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:38,389
that too in the past. Or maybe you still do. Any advice? You even got the calorie drinks.

150
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:42,230
Careful with the calorie drinks. Those, they've got a lot of like mouth of dextrin in them,

151
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:52,739
which is just heavy sugar bullshit. They're full of almost cake batter. But when I was

152
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,619
working out when I actually cared about lifting and trying to be physically fit and all that

153
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:03,260
years ago, just, you just got to eat, especially if you have like a lightning

154
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:09,190
metabolism like I do. You just kind of have to, you have to eat high calorie foods,

155
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,469
but a good, you don't, you don't want to just dump empty calories in your body. You'll get

156
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:21,750
fat. You'll gain weight that you don't want if you eat, you know, 50, 60, 80 grams of

157
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:31,480
saturated fat. You could eat a whole pizza every day and you'd gain weight, but you'd,

158
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:41,829
it would be bad. It would be all over the place. But yeah, I eat a lot of tuna fish.

159
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:49,739
You have to really like it though. And I don't really, I'm not sure if like the medical

160
00:44:49,739 --> 00:45:00,860
science there would tell you to eat a bunch of tuna anymore, but I wish you luck. It's a

161
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:34,809
journey. What are you doing? Skrillex tweeted you. What? Hold on, is this Skrillex?

162
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:50,920
The giant rat that makes all the rules. This is a real account? Why did you, why is this,

163
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,860
or is it weird that I automatically assume his account got hacked?

164
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:09,289
Like that, is that real? Wow. That's kind of, that's kind of crazy. I did. That's,

165
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:25,829
he's a fan. Well, if you're watching this Skrillex, that's high. That's,

166
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:32,059
I did not think I was going to get up in the morning and see that Skrillex has a tweet of the

167
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:50,019
rats song, but yeah, cool. Very cool. But anyway, respond to the tweet. Yeah, maybe later I'll like

168
00:46:50,900 --> 00:47:03,050
do something, a reply or something. That's wild. Anyway, let's get, let's keep going with the

169
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:14,630
bits. Uh, door cube says, I can't want, thank you to the 250 door cube. Can't watch the

170
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,750
stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of your word. I just read

171
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:26,619
this. That's how slow I am right now. I am on, I, I am like, pull it up to the fucking gas

172
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:42,090
station, but that was snoozing copter and door cube. Uh, thank you code man for the 250.

173
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,710
Thanks code man. Be honest. You're, but you shower in your swim trunks, don't you?

174
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:59,210
No, I don't. I shower naked like every normal human being. Thank you. Zero giblets

175
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,570
for the bits. Thank you for screaming like the judge from Roger Rabbit being dipped when you

176
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:14,679
fell in the lava. Who showers naked? I'm going to take a bath today. That's what I'm doing.

177
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:31,190
Somebody said, look at the comments on that, on that thread. What is that fucking image?

178
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:50,630
What is that like third image down? It's just, which one? The one of my face with

179
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:58,420
teeth stretched out and my face squished in. Show, show. I mean, here's the tweet. Just go,

180
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:11,940
just look down. But thank you. Thank you some guy for the five bucks. And it's a,

181
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:17,750
it's a YouTube link. I'm back for the first time in forever with another meme video.

182
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:22,150
I'm still too lazy to edit together an actual good Phantom meme. So here's another place

183
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:28,630
holder. I actually have to change so I can see this. It's going through the vibe still.

184
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:40,139
And make it so it's coming through the actual desktop and not the headphones on the bind.

185
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:54,019
You guys are fucking, you guys are fucking too much. How's that? Can I hear? I can hear now.

186
00:49:54,019 --> 00:50:07,019
I say can, can you hear though? That's important. Speakers. There they are. Testing.

187
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:13,940
There we go. All right. So this is a meme video. I wonder what kind of meme it is.

188
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:36,260
There's this dog, dog them style T-Rex. Is that, I don't,

189
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:53,670
somebody came in and said, did he play nothing but Minecraft? The unfortunate answer is yes.

190
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,460
And then I played Rick and Morty. I thought Rick, I, oh, how many people left during that?

191
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:22,900
I wanted to have five minutes later, like 200, about 200. I can't believe like this

192
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:33,590
four or five thousand fucking people. That's, you guys are two kinds. Seriously. But thank

193
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:41,880
you for the meme video some guy. Thank you. Oh, we have a Jane Dole Walken,

194
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:50,179
$15 from Jane Dole Walken. They say making evil meals, making evil meals.

195
00:51:50,820 --> 00:52:01,019
I'm not sure that's a reference to, but thank you, Jane Dole Walken. End the stream

196
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:10,650
so I can watch the VOD faster. Not much longer. We're only going to get a few more.

197
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:17,130
And by a few more, I mean like 10 maybe. Here we go. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR,

198
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:28,139
gave $10 and they say, first of all, thank you for the $10. I ain't changing it. You lied

199
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:34,380
somehow. I just don't know how yet. Upon further investigation, you did not reenact

200
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:41,239
JermaCraft The Adventure Begins episode one. You paraphrased it at best. I called the police to

201
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:54,360
ask and they said you lied. I, how am I supposed to memorize the entire first three minutes of that

202
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:08,010
video? I've seen it. I, I know it kind of. Half of chat has it memorized. You lived it.

203
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:23,079
Yeah, I lived it. I didn't see lots of fails. I didn't say lots of fails, lots of triumphs.

204
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:31,320
That's not good. But thank you, Jerma lied about Minecraft for the $10 and for the

205
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:44,860
community subs as well. Thank you. Thank you. Al the chemist, Al the chemist for the $3. Hey

206
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,739
man, I'm pretty fucking drunk right now, but just want to let you know that I think you're

207
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:51,900
an incredibly funny and interesting person and you bring me such joy when you stream.

208
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:55,579
Thank God you stream later now. I can actually watch your stuff.

209
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,579
LOL. I'll send more bits later because I bought the 500 pack, but next time the message will

210
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:07,739
be less coherent because I'm still drinking. We'll fuck. Let's see. We'll see. That's Al

211
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:18,179
the chemist. That was about two hours ago. Thank you so much. I'm honored that you think

212
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:27,000
that I'm interesting. Thank you as always. Thank you so much. He's drunk so he doesn't

213
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,679
mean it. No, he's drunk. So he does mean it. That's the reverse of what you're talking

214
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:39,960
about. Uh, Freudian weapon gave $10. They said this stream made it makes me really

215
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,760
want to pick my Minecraft back up again. Good way to de-stress. Yeah, we caught that

216
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:53,800
one earlier, but it's true. You can't really just hang out and hit some trees. I had it.

217
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,079
That was, I thought this was a great, this is a good stream. I liked just kind of

218
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:02,219
experiencing that again, even though I wish I could have done it a little longer,

219
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:10,579
maybe go and explore some more, but it was scary in VR. It was good. It was a lot of

220
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:17,929
fun. Highly recommend it. And if you have a Vi that's free, the VR portion at least.

221
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:29,900
Al the chemist, an hour later than his first message. Thank you for the, I mean, this is

222
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,860
under the bit minimum here, but I'm curious. I need to know. This is the second cheer from

223
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:40,860
my drunk Memei. Dude, I hope you had fun. Minecraft is def a game that has its merits.

224
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,179
Hope you give a modded Minecraft to try sometime. That'd be cool. Have a good night.

225
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:55,219
That's, no, that's, that's very coherent actually. Now under the bit reading about

226
00:55:56,179 --> 00:56:09,210
unbelievable. No, it's not like one of a, it's not like, I don't like Minecraft. I give it

227
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:15,179
shit, but you know, I'm just kidding around. Oh, it's a kid's game. No, it's an any,

228
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:20,119
anybody can enjoy that experience. I'm just fucking around. I hope you know that guys.

229
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:28,780
And now he's backtracking. That's, I'm the master of backtracking. I say something

230
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:33,099
and then I think, eh, probably shouldn't have said it four hours later. I go, Hey, by the way,

231
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:48,010
but thank you Al the chemist. Thank you smelly boy for the 250. This is actually horrible.

232
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:55,739
Please go back to Minecraft. Was it Rick and Morty? Was it the Rick and Morty game?

233
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:03,739
They probably should have just stayed in Minecraft for another 30 to 40 minutes and

234
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:18,420
do the whole four, four and a half hours in Minecraft. No, I blame part of that on me

235
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:30,230
because I wasn't really talking. It wasn't really saying much. Blasted. When I get tired,

236
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:46,170
when I, you know, start to slow down, I shut off and just, what's that? Oh, okay. Yeah.

237
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:56,889
And that's why I decided it's like, it's probably time to stop. Demonic cucumber. Thank

238
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:05,980
you. They say I witnessed one of the rarest events in the game. Lightning will randomly

239
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:25,050
spawn maybe a skeleton trap horse with a chance of 0.75 to 1.5% chance on easy. It's a, wow,

240
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:34,699
and I got four at once. And there's a 1.5 to 4% chance on normal and a 6.7% chance

241
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:40,699
or 2.8% chance on hard. On top of that, skeleton horses have the rarest spawn rates,

242
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:44,539
making the chances of you seeing that less than 1%. In fact, I'd wager that you are

243
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:50,300
the first person to ever experience that on a VR live stream. You've literally become

244
00:58:50,300 --> 00:59:05,349
a part of Minecraft history. All right. Hey, it was crazy. That's why I didn't want to just,

245
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:12,889
I was going to move on after I got out of the dungeon. And then what did he do?

246
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:24,900
I got on the horse and I rode it for a little bit. I died a few times. And then the first,

247
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:31,400
the last stream, I got a woodland mansion on spawn. Why is your Minecraft, why is your luck so good?

248
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:40,090
Didn't you guys ever hear the character sheet that Star made for me? I've said it before.

249
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:59,590
10 charisma, 10 luck, zero in every single other category. I would say I have,

250
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:09,829
I got to give myself at least a few points in strength. You know, I'm not just going to have

251
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:26,710
zero strength, but I don't know. Sometimes there's, I don't know how. 2012.

252
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:37,420
Seven strength, two intelligence. What is the intelligence point level for at least an eighth

253
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:45,480
grader? I have an, at least an eighth to 10th grade intelligence to give me some credit.

254
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:55,510
Four, I'll take a four or five and it are apps. Definitely. I'll take a four or five

255
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:06,820
in intelligence. Anything below eight is an animal, is animal level. What? But if that is true,

256
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:15,780
if that really was one of the rarest Minecraft events you could ever see, I, that's cool.

257
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:23,269
I'm happy to have been able to show it then. Hey the Jack, thanks for the $5. Everyone in

258
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:39,960
chat only hates the Rick and Morty VR because of their low IQ scores. Rick and Morty. Thank

259
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:58,969
you. Get dunked on. Hey Jerma, I did a rat's mashup. Really hope you like it. Rats mashup.

260
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,260
This sounds elaborate.

261
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:40,489
I'll just show it. Might as well just put it on the screen, right?

262
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:23,269
This is the gentleman of the jury.

263
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:29,349
What is hard for others?

264
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:43,619
I'm sure you'll get it. Speed it up. Speed it up.

265
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:11,320
Special day. Shut up idiot. Come on Michael, you ruin your fucking birthday every year for

266
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,900
everybody else. That we get it. It's my birthday today. Not anybody else's. It's my birthday.

267
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,739
Calm down. Do you hear what they just said? Now hold on just a second. Pause the movie.

268
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:25,800
Hip-hop. Just dance together as a family for once.

269
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,440
Rats. Rats. We are the rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.

270
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,869
Take it actually. We are the rats. Michael, it's your birthday today.

271
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,329
Come on then. It's your birthday today.

272
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,489
Which is iPod conversion.

273
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:52,409
Rats. Rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.

274
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:58,440
Welcome to the dog camp. Trust you're all right.

275
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,800
In that case, walk away.

276
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,400
It's pretty good filler content, yeah.

277
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,320
I'm waiting for you shit to find a dirty toothbrush.

278
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,320
This is just to make sure you understand the story.

279
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:26,619
What is this voice for this character by the way?

280
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,340
I know exactly who we can sell these to.

281
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:49,460
Rats. Rats. We are the rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.

282
01:05:49,460 --> 01:06:12,340
Wait, what's this? Who's this in the car? What TV show is this?

283
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:18,570
It's fucking birthday every year for everybody else.

284
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:43,019
We get it. I went through so much trouble to get you these rats.

285
01:06:43,019 --> 01:07:03,110
Wow. Shocking. That's a real shock right there. That was ridiculous. That was very, very,

286
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:16,139
very good. Thank you so much for that. That was very well put together. That was get dunked on,

287
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:34,170
by the way. It was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much. Get dunked on. Glad we got to see it on

288
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:42,300
stream. And then we had three dollars from al store H2O. Thank you for the three bucks.

289
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:45,480
Hey German, for the first time since the start of making videos for fun,

290
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,480
I'm trying to record an audio track for a video. The thing is I don't think my voice

291
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,800
is pleasant enough and I don't think I can physically convey the emotion needed for the

292
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,420
video. What do you do to get the right voice and emotion for your jokes and videos?

293
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,420
And is it okay to just give up and try to work without one if I can't make it work?

294
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:10,679
Thanks and I hope you have a great night. Well, there's three or four kind of just probably

295
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:16,920
two or three actual questions in here. And the first one I would tell you is,

296
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:28,229
if you're talking about recording voice lines, in almost every single thing you've ever heard

297
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:35,430
me say, all the voices you've ever heard were based on somebody in real life or somebody that

298
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:42,310
I've heard before. Grandpa is actually based on the grandpa voice, this one here. Grandpa,

299
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:49,619
this one, is based on my actual fucking grandmother. That's how my grandmother talked.

300
01:08:49,619 --> 01:09:01,800
And I would just imitate all her friends. That is my grandmother's voice. And I think

301
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:10,390
a lot of it comes from observing and imitating, whether it's somebody that's a celebrity or a

302
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:15,829
friend of yours that talks in a certain way, has certain cadences. Picking up on mannerisms

303
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:20,470
and cadences is actually potentially more important than having a voice sound different,

304
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:36,979
especially if you're trying to do voices. But for the second part of that,

305
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,949
it just comes to practice. And look, I'll be real. I'll be completely real.

306
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:47,989
You see, you mentioned, is it okay to try to work without one or to just give up if I can't

307
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:57,689
make it work? If everybody has something they can do, right? And even if, let's just say,

308
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:01,050
for instance, if you're really into voice work, you really love voice acting,

309
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:06,729
you love cartoons, you love voice over artists, you live and breathe in something

310
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:11,880
you fucking love so much. There are other jobs in that industry that aren't necessarily

311
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:19,180
recording the voice work. You don't have to be the one that's producing the sound out of your

312
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,819
mouth. You can be an engineer, you can be a writer, you can be an audio technician,

313
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:30,039
you can even work in the field. And I think a lot of people maybe get a little caught up in

314
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:40,140
needing to do that one specific thing, right? When that one specific thing has a lot of

315
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:45,899
branches with a ton of leaves on them that are different things to do in that field that

316
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:52,010
will scratch the same itch from doing the thing that you really wanted to do in the first place.

317
01:10:52,010 --> 01:11:07,609
But that's not to say to, oh, just give up. Give up on your dreams. No. Give them a try.

318
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:25,909
Go for it. But there's more than just that one thing. There's a lot more. I hope that

319
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:35,960
answers your question. Look, if people gave up on their dreams, we wouldn't have

320
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,899
half of the shit that we have in society today. Half of the stuff that we like,

321
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:47,140
that we all know, that we care about, probably wouldn't even exist at all.

322
01:11:47,140 --> 01:12:01,670
If everybody was like, nah, you know what, forget it. But thank you so much. I wish you

323
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:10,619
the best of luck. That was Al Storr. Thank you, Al Storr. I also have to remember that

324
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:16,920
half of following your dreams is luck. Yeah, it's a lot of factors. It's a complex,

325
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:24,890
complicated thing. And that is trying to live up to your dream. Because there are so many

326
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:32,090
outside factors that are in play that you might not even be aware of. That luck plays a very,

327
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:37,989
very large role. Being at the right place, in the right moment, talking to the right person,

328
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:42,229
somehow being in the right place at the right time. It means a lot.

329
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:59,079
Yeah, you got it right there. Luck, hard work, talent, more. It's a complex mixture of a

330
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:12,550
bunch of different things. But not necessarily when you're following a dream. You're usually

331
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,789
following it because you have a plan in mind. You have factors that can influence your path

332
01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:27,189
towards that dream. Yeah, but I can tell you right now as a 33 going on 34 year old, plans

333
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:36,810
always change. They just do. You might have the end goal in your eyes at what you want to

334
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:44,359
do, but the plans are always changing. Stuff is always changing in a plan, especially in a life

335
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:50,819
goal. Because the way that I had my plan set out and the thing that I really cared about

336
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:56,500
has warped and changed directions and moved around. It's the goal is still there. It's

337
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,489
still there, but that path changes. And you might not even know you're on a different one.

338
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:07,829
You might be doing something that you don't even understand until years later is a branch

339
01:14:07,829 --> 01:14:17,960
of a path that you were on in the beginning. Be flexible. Yeah, that's a really good point.

340
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:46,359
Will I play Monster Rancher VR when it comes out? Yeah, whenever that is. You could use that

341
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:52,569
anywhere. Whatever your dream is. Whatever you want to do. Whatever the message here was about

342
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:56,970
voice work. But apply that to anything. Apply that to anything that you want to do in your

343
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:14,409
life. But thank you Al Store. Good luck. And get dunked on again. We just touched upon the

344
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:20,710
video that we just watched. You gave another five, six, seven almost dollars here. Thank you

345
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:30,920
for that awesome video. Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250. I say to Jerma Hart. Thank

346
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:38,939
you. SereneFP, thanks for the 250. You know, Jerma started regularly watching your streams

347
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:43,500
exactly a year ago during your speed run of Monster Rancher 2. Wanted to thank you for

348
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:54,869
being one of the few streamers who can genuinely make me laugh. Yeah, I'm fucking grateful

349
01:15:54,869 --> 01:16:01,819
and thankful that you came. I'm glad you think the things I say are worth watching.

350
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:08,010
Really appreciate that. And you bring up Monster Rancher. I actually think I'm going

351
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:13,670
to go back to Monster Rancher 2. I have this weird itch to play it. I don't know why.

352
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:24,789
For some reason. It's just I feel like I want to do it again. Hey, Magellan, thanks

353
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:28,149
for the five dollars. Had a great time tonight, Jerma. Glad you decided to stick out Minecraft

354
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:33,430
VR for a bit longer and make a session out of it. Definitely seems like you enjoyed it.

355
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:36,229
Thank you for all the laughs and wonderful times you bring the community and I. Have

356
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:42,600
fun with your friends in the next few days and rest up from all the VR. Thank you.

357
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:55,000
I will have a few days here where I'm going to take the days, you know. It's been a

358
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,159
little nicer. It was really beautiful out today. Get some sun. Hang out with some friends.

359
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:11,699
And I got a little bit of work I can get done as well in a couple of days. A little

360
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:18,100
bit of not stream or video related type stuff. There's things that I've kind of

361
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:31,420
been on the back burner that I have to get done. But thank you. Let me add a Dorkcube.

362
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:36,939
Thanks to the 250 Dorkcube. You're getting a rare spawn in Minecraft despite your love

363
01:17:36,939 --> 01:17:41,260
hate relationship with the game reminds me of that Futurama episode where the professor

364
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:58,630
accidentally disproos evolution. Yeah. That was a great show. This was such a perfect moment.

365
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:29,220
You called exactly what was going to happen. What do you mean? What did I do? Oh no.

366
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:35,670
Where's my house? Like that was going to do anything. What's one of the four horsemen

367
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:52,659
doing here? What? It really did look like the four horsemen. That wave though. That's like

368
01:18:53,300 --> 01:19:08,569
that had a giant lollipop. Get away from me. Get away. He summoned it. I have expected

369
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:21,479
Metallica to start playing. That's so funny. But thank you. Thank you. That was Demonic

370
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:28,659
Cucumber. Thank you. Anything else show official for the five bucks. You're the man.

371
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:32,659
I've been working on a new Vegas mod for you and wanted to say thank you for the inspiration.

372
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:36,579
All the models and stuff I've been working on are in the creative channel on Discord.

373
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:39,939
I'm not finished with the mod but I wanted to tell you that. My life has been busy

374
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:43,460
and stressful in the mod and streams is the one thing I've been excited about.

375
01:19:45,319 --> 01:20:01,140
I can't wait to see what you come up with. That's somebody making a mod. That's awesome.

376
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:10,619
I sincerely fucking look forward to what it comes up. Thank you. Anything show. Anything

377
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:15,819
else show official for the five bucks. Keep us updated. Keep us posted on it.

378
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:22,520
The Jack. Thanks for five dollars, Jack. Do you actually yourself like the silly memes

379
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,680
from years past that we still use or are so detached to how you are now?

380
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:40,939
No, I mean, all jokes aside, they're locked away inside my heart there in the chest

381
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:44,939
pump thing that puts blood through into your brain and into your body.

382
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:57,189
So no, I don't hate old references and memes because at some point that means that this

383
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:04,630
is like a living breathing community, right? That makes me happy to know that. That people

384
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:10,789
are using references that from years ago or things that they're coming up with. That means

385
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:15,590
that we have a great community. That means we have a very active, lively community.

386
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:41,210
But thank you, the Jack. I do not hate the memes. No. And thank you to Al Store again.

387
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:46,340
Four dollars and 50 cents for Al Store. This is compensation for accidentally putting

388
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:54,279
in so much in one message. I already spent like 25 to 30 hours on a video so the voice work

389
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:59,000
might be supplementary and I think I'll be proud of it regardless. But I still needed to hear

390
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,640
what you said and I can't thank you enough. You're always so comforting and practical with

391
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:13,109
life advice. I really wish that whatever you do, it's something that you like doing.

392
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:19,079
Something that you can enjoy. Something that you can work on

393
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:35,529
and be like, that was good. I liked that. I enjoyed that. Thank you so much Al Store.

394
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,100
And with that, we are going to run the credits. All the new subs and all the old subs

395
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:57,260
coming on the screen right now. I will see you all on Wednesday. So three, so four days from

396
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:17,220
now. Yeah, one, two, three. I'll see you on the 20th. I'm going to go take a bath and get

397
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:26,779
some food. Have a great rest of your beginning of your weekend, right, Saturday. Still fairly

398
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:32,220
early on Saturday Pacific. Hopefully you guys are going to enjoy your St. Patrick's Day,

399
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:42,069
right? That's today, right? St. Patrick's Day is today, right? No, it's tomorrow.

400
01:23:42,069 --> 01:23:52,340
So happy St. Patrick's Day for all of you. Let's celebrate tomorrow. It's Sunday afternoon

401
01:23:52,340 --> 01:24:10,409
here. Well, there you go. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Highly recommend looking to the Deluxe

402
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:14,890
Audio Strap for the Vive. Makes tightening it up a lot easier and the headphones are on

403
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:20,010
ears so no worrying about them slipping out. Yeah, but it's also my problem too. I do one

404
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:34,229
earphone because I lost my mind and I can't find it. No, I, for some reason, 10-15 years

405
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:40,310
ago, I came to this assumption that I cannot do two headphones in. And even with in-ear

406
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:45,989
back, you know, the open back ones, it still just makes me feel claustrophobic. I don't

407
01:24:45,989 --> 01:25:05,260
know why. I'm just a weirdo. And then finally we had a Leos BM came in right now with

408
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:12,899
three bucks, three dollars. I just resubbed. Can't donate on mobile, but I thought I'd

409
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:17,300
ask, I'd like to ask this here. I've always liked to do impressions of people, like

410
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,779
you said, and seeing you as an inspiration. I know I want to do something with that

411
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:25,619
talent and streaming seems great, but I feel like it's too late to get into it at this

412
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:29,300
point. Do you think that being a comedy streamer is something that I could viably

413
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:41,020
pursue? Thanks. It's hard to answer that question because content and what people

414
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:46,260
want to see and what people watch, it's hard to say, hey, that material is going

415
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:56,659
to work. That material won't work. You need to do this for material. It's a hard

416
01:25:56,659 --> 01:26:03,859
question to answer because on one hand you have the true just reality of Twitch,

417
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:08,979
right? And that's thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasters all at the

418
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:13,560
same time, all going, all trying to get people on their streams and hey, come on

419
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,840
to come to my stream. Hang on to my stream. Look what I'm doing. I'm doing

420
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,640
something here. I'm playing this game. You like that game, right? It's a lot.

421
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:26,119
So trying to differentiate yourself and put yourself out there as it's very

422
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:32,979
difficult to do, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to do it. Just

423
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:38,520
make sure you be realistic. Make sure that you are doing it because you want to

424
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:42,039
and it's something that you want to do. It's something that you care about,

425
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:52,420
not something that you're doing because you think you have to. And you can take

426
01:26:52,420 --> 01:27:07,060
that last conversation we had about it and apply it to this too. You need to

427
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,619
enjoy it regardless of how many people watch. Yeah, you have to just...

428
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:16,630
When I made my first five YouTube videos, I just was doing them because I

429
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:23,270
wanted to do them. That seems like fun. That seems interesting. That seems like

430
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,909
something I think is really cool. That's something I want to try to do.

431
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:34,420
The only rule is you can't stream when Jerma is streaming. You dig?

432
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:45,399
Now it's all about the money. Now the thing is though, you'll never know unless you try.

433
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:55,050
You can't fail unless you try. I was thinking about that, but I didn't. I think

434
01:27:55,050 --> 01:28:01,159
I just would fail at it. Just do it. There's no reason not to try it.

435
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:15,689
And networking goes a long way. Hanging out, trying to help out in other people's streams,

436
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:21,449
finding similar interests and collaborating. Only if people want to collaborate. You never want

437
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:26,170
to throw yourself into a situation where you're like, hey, what's going on? How are you? I see

438
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:39,210
that you do this too. Let's do a video tomorrow. Which is natural. The only way to get

439
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:48,010
up is to fall down sometimes. Go watch my first 50 YouTube videos.

440
01:28:49,289 --> 01:28:55,050
And tell me that I didn't figure out more things to try and did some things wrong.

441
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,699
Maybe I shouldn't have uploaded that video because was that video good?

442
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:10,390
My latest videos from the last two years ago, you learn. You grow. And you keep trying.

443
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:28,460
Go watch my latest videos from two and a half years ago. But I wish you the best of luck.

444
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:36,439
Is it Leos or Leo? It's probably Leo SSBM. I think I called you Leos.

445
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:46,819
Yeah, but you can't figure out what you want to do until you try to start doing it in the first

446
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:55,380
place. Everybody has this big painting that they have. And there's a giant canvas on the wall.

447
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,340
It's an empty canvas. And it's just sitting up there. And it's, I can't wait for this

448
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,500
painting. It's going to be, look at this fucking huge painting. Oh, there's the Mona Lisa

449
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:09,619
is going to be there flying. And over there, there's a cheetah that's going to be over there.

450
01:30:09,619 --> 01:30:14,649
There's a jungle. But it's like, you got to start painting. Yeah, yeah, I know. But look

451
01:30:14,649 --> 01:30:21,270
at the cheetah. The cheetah is coming out there from the jungle. And then you go and you start

452
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:24,550
on the cheetah. And everyone's like, all right, man, I can't wait to see the huge

453
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:31,260
15 by 15 foot mural on the wall. And then you start painting the fucking cheetah portion.

454
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:36,470
Maybe you start painting the tree. And it's a little bit of brown paint. And it looks like

455
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:45,319
a little smudge. Eventually that little smudge turns into the bark. And that bark turns into

456
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:50,119
the branches. That branches turns into the tree. And then that tree turns into the cheetah.

457
01:30:51,539 --> 01:31:03,659
And then the cheetah turns into the Mona Lisa. You have to start painting. Somebody said,

458
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:10,310
you lost me. Point is, everybody has a big picture that they want to paint. Well,

459
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:15,159
maybe not everybody. But a lot of people have this big painting. And you have to close

460
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:19,319
down a little. And remember, you have to start, you have to start painting that painting.

461
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,659
And it's not going to look like the painting that you think it is until it's done,

462
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:33,189
potentially months or years later. Start small and put realistic goals in front of yourself.

463
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:51,850
Just use a spray can. But that's my time. I will see you guys on Wednesday. Have a great

464
01:31:51,850 --> 01:32:20,340
rest of your weekend. Take care, all of you. See you on Wednesday. Ta ta. Goodbye.

465
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:23,850
Oh, and uh, what's the way he'll somebody's birthday?

466
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:31,779
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Was it bath? Happy birthday tomorrow on St. Patrick's Day.

467
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,720
Have a good one. See you Wednesday.
