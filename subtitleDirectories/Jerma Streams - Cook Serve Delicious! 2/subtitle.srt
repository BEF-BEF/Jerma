1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:09,589
Alright, now we're gonna move on. We're gonna play, um, we're gonna play Cook, Serve, Delicious 2

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:25,699
for the remainder of our chillout stream. Let's go ahead and close this and open it up.

3
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:39,289
That's a thing? Yeah, it is a thing, apparently. They're making a third.

4
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,960
Are they really making a third? How do you make this game three times?

5
00:00:49,909 --> 00:01:01,979
Do you add? What do you add to it? More recipes? No, Xbox Game Bar.

6
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,659
Xbox Game Bar. I don't want to take a fucking screenshot.

7
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:17,319
You know what I think the weirdest thing in the world is? Why? Why is Xbox trying to tell me

8
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:24,200
I can take a screenshot with their Xbox game thing? It's like, you just hit print screen

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,549
and just paste it. Like, what? Hey, in case you know, you can take a screenshot of this game. I

10
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,069
know. I know. It's a, it's a button on my keyboard that has been a function for 30 fucking years.

11
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:51,140
What? This song is kind of poppin', I'll tell you though. Now let me change the game.

12
00:01:51,859 --> 00:02:09,060
Is the Cook Serve Delicious 2? Is this better than the first one? No, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no,

13
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:19,379
yes, no, no, no. We'll find out. Start game. Here we go. Local saves. Cloud saves. I don't have any

14
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:28,659
saves. Local save. New slave, new slave slot. New save slot. I can't fucking talk. New save slot.

15
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:39,539
It began like any other morning at Sherry's Soda Tower. You rode the elevator up to your

16
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,860
Platinum Star restaurant, Cook Serve Delicious, and reflected warmly upon your culinary brilliance

17
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,689
and magical powers, life was good. Without warning, police surrounded Sherry's Soda Tower.

18
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,530
It seemed company executives were siphoning funds from the corporation,

19
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,009
while at the same time incurring a staggering amount of debt which drained the accounts of

20
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:02,169
the tower and all the businesses inside. Everything was put up for federal auction.

21
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:11,139
Cook Serve Delicious was no more. Angry but determined to rebuild, you purchased a modest

22
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,580
commercial space on the 52nd floor of the Terrigan Tower, the largest skyscraper in the city,

23
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,889
packed with thousands of ravenous tenants. It is here that you will start a brand new Cook

24
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,449
Serve Delicious restaurant, build it back to its former glory, work at other restaurants to rebuild

25
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:34,250
your finances and expand your culinary knowledge and cement your legacy as the best chef in the

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,729
world. Good luck. I already am. That's what happened in Cook Serve Delicious 1. I became the best chef

27
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:48,020
in the world. So I already know what I'm doing. I already know kind of how to do this. But oh,

28
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:55,379
no, no, no, I don't need to click this. I already know how to do this stuff. But let's, you know

29
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:02,379
what, let's just do it. This is a relaxed stream. You're out of practice. That's true. Yeah,

30
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,530
there's the prep stations to your left, where orders appear as customers arrive. Enough talk,

31
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,930
enough talking. Let's cook. Select your order by clicking that order on the left or by pressing

32
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:19,939
one on your keyboard. All right. One hole in one nachos. Those are the ingredients. Yep. QSJV.

33
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,620
QSJV. Use the recipe on the bottom of the screen to place the correct ingredients ordered by the

34
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,459
customer. All right. So we've got queso cream beans. So that is queso cream beans. I did it in

35
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:43,509
a half a second and that's it. Press enter. Let's make it more complex stuff. I'm making a hamburger.

36
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,819
Place the ingredient and begin to cook. M is for meat patty. Two patties. Oh, those look good.

37
00:04:51,540 --> 00:05:00,329
Those look good. That looks good. Okay, let's go. The meat is cooking. The white timer indicates

38
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,290
how long this food has left to cook. Once it turns blue, the food is ready to be prepped again.

39
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,930
Okay, so I just wait for it to turn blue. Blue. Select the order once it turns blue. Don't prep

40
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:19,420
it too early or the order will be raw. Okay, so let's prep it. This food has a greater number

41
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:26,579
of ingredients that spans two pages. Oh, don't make me do two pages. Ingredients have color boxes

42
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:37,000
to the left of them to easily show what page they are on. Oh, okay. So you press space. Press space.

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,579
Click the green space button or scroll the mouse wheel or press space. Good. So this person just

44
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:55,850
wants two meat patties and a regular bun. And a regular bun. All right. Done. All right, guys.

45
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,230
I gotta go. I'm gonna make one of these right now. I'm out of here. The bun looks wet. That's

46
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,660
no, that's good. You want the little drizzle of fucking oil on it. All right, so that's it.

47
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Press space. Press enter. That's good. Done. And depending on how well you did, you'll get either

48
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,819
I'm in chat or I'm scared at something. Munkah S. Or you'll get like react harder, whichever one is

49
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:31,339
better. Yep. Perfect average of bad rating. Always strive for a perfect rating. Yeah. Wait,

50
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:38,569
there's holding stations in this one. Holding stations are the key to making things much easier

51
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,819
for you when a huge amount of customers walk through the door. In fact, if you don't utilize

52
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:49,180
them, the game can become quite difficult and sometimes impossible. Try accepting the order

53
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,500
on the left. You'll notice you cannot select this food. It has a red HS icon, meaning that it must

54
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:04,139
be prepared in a holding station before you can serve it. Let's do that now. Select holding

55
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,300
station one by clicking it or by pressing the button combination. In this case, hold down tab

56
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:17,350
and press one tab one. Oh Jesus. Select the pretzel and follow the recipe. The recipe will be

57
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,949
completely random each time you make food in the holding station. So pay close attention to make

58
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:27,829
sure it's done perfectly. Select a food to prep. Each page has a different category of food,

59
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:33,990
holding station, required foods, holding station, opera, operational, optional foods and side dishes.

60
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:44,379
Okay, so holding station, pretzel. We just want a German pretzel. Follow the recipe. Just German

61
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:53,000
pretzels. Get it in the oven. Just like the hamburger, we must wait until the food is finished

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,639
cooking before we can select it again. Holding stations are fully automated. Once the food is

63
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,639
finished cooking, it will... What did you fucking just say? I have to restart the whole game.

64
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,839
Pretzel is now in the holding station and ready to serve. Try selecting the pretzel in the prep

65
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:23,560
station. I got four in there. So that is ready. Oh, that's much better than the first game.

66
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:32,100
You actually get to put stuff and queue stuff up and have it made already. Now we're talking.

67
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,710
All right, one serving has been deducted from the holding station. You still have three more left to

68
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,710
serve to anyone coming and wanting pretzels. The food is going to decrease in freshness as the day

69
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,830
progresses. Once the clock runs out next to the serving number, food must be thrown away.

70
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,659
Certain things stay fresh or longer. All holding station orders must be cooked perfectly

71
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,299
or they cannot be served. Try serving these next three orders.

72
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,909
Dang. See how fast you can serve customers with holding stations? They're great. You've learned

73
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,429
the very basics of the game. However, there are still items such as side dishes, chores,

74
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:13,429
drinks, and holding station operational foods that you can learn in the extra tutorials. You

75
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:18,710
should absolutely check those out when you can. If you're ready to cook, hop into Max Wieners.

76
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,149
I heard they're looking for a good chef or spend your money over the food catalog and start

77
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:32,889
building your own menu and cook serve delicious too. Good luck from Mr. Risotto. Optional foods,

78
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:40,889
side dishes. You know, I need to do these. It's one minute. Holding station optional foods are

79
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,730
orders that can either be prepared in a prep station or made ahead of time in a holding station.

80
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:51,179
Okay, so let's make chicken nugget basket. I like these too.

81
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:03,059
Place the nuggets, dunk, and cook. Try to dunk. Is that it? Are they cooking?

82
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,899
Yeah, they are. They can be served when finished. Serve the order once it's ready.

83
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,080
Done. All right. Cool. Oh, I just want like a bunch of chicken nuggets and hamburgers and

84
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,409
shit right now. So you can make food beforehand. Select holding station one, then turn the page of

85
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:28,730
the holding station optional foods, and then select chicken nuggets. Okay. Select the food

86
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:36,419
to prep. There are no HS required foods on your menu. Okay, here's nuggets. So let's just make

87
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:53,240
them. So dunk them. How much should I make? Four. Okay. Nuggets are almost done. Now you have six

88
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,110
nuggets. Everybody could smell them. So they ran in. This is great for pre rush hour moments when

89
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,149
you feel you might have an influx of customers try serving all the customers that come in. I'll do

90
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:15,860
it as fast as I fucking can. Here we go. Ready? Nice. Beware optional foods take up space that

91
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,870
might be better used for side dishes or more holding station required foods. It'll be up to

92
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:32,779
you to find that perfect balance. I'm gonna fucking lose in the first level. I've already sprinted

93
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,899
to the side dishes. Customers won't wait for their orders for very long. As you can see,

94
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,779
this order that has arrived is quickly going off the screen. If it disappears completely,

95
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,740
it'll be counted as a bad order. You can see how long a customer will wait by the patience meter

96
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:58,980
measured in seconds. This meter will I'm training. This meter will drain as you make more and more

97
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,200
perfect foods and your buzz increases. Okay, so two seconds. To increase customer patience,

98
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,320
we must make side dishes. Select holding station one, turn the page of the side dishes and prepare.

99
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:17,539
Okay. Side dishes. So we make make a side salad with lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, croutons,

100
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:27,029
and cucumbers. Lettuce. That's it. That salad sucks. It was a terrible salad. It's just like

101
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:39,220
iceberg lettuce and like a bunch of shape. I wouldn't eat this. And then ATRU. Good. I got

102
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,429
five of these. So every unique side dish in your holding station, that's 15 seconds to the patience

103
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:54,100
meter. Don't act like you eat vegetables. I eat vegetables all the damn time. You can think I eat

104
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:04,860
vegetables. I don't act like you eat vegetables. For some reason, I don't think a lot of you guys

105
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:20,779
think I eat Captain Crunch and hamburger meat. No, I eat lots of stuff. I drink pineapple juice

106
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,309
and McChickens. Yeah, I got a steady diet of McChickens, Captain Crunch, whole milk,

107
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:41,860
and chicken nuggets. No, I am a I'm a fucking adult. I'm 33 years old. I have salads. I have

108
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,080
the good sources of protein. Like I don't even why am I explaining this? You guys already know all

109
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,419
this. One person said I eat like Captain Crunch every day and it freaked me out. Order a salad

110
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:03,240
right now. No, I don't want a salad right now. So I had a salad fucking like yesterday. All right,

111
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm trying let me pay attention to the game. Every unique side dish in your holding station

112
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,789
has 15 seconds. Okay, you can have up to three unique sides on your menu, which can give you a

113
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:20,820
possible 45 extra seconds of patience. This is huge when you have a large influx of customers.

114
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,080
They will always order a random available side dish with their meal, which also increases your

115
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,960
income. Okay, so you have to have like a variety. Have at least one side dish in your holding station

116
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,220
as it's easy way to prevent walkouts and bad orders. I'm going to do a taste test on spring.

117
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,860
You can blindfold me. You put a bowl of Captain Crunch with crunch berries and then put a salad

118
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:52,100
on the other side. And I'll tell you, I'll do a taste test with a blindfold on. All right,

119
00:14:52,100 --> 00:15:03,129
drinks and delicious. Drinks like side dish like goes out. Each drink item has a set number of

120
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:09,049
customers can be served to. I think I'm ready. Buzz cool moves. Keyboard users can fully remap

121
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:14,679
their keys for holding stations in key options. We should check out the options menu. Okay.

122
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,409
Practice chores. No, no, no. I don't need to practice chores. I don't have to drink out of

123
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:32,200
the toilet. Fs. Enter. Two is load the dishes. Begin washing the dishes. Wait with the green

124
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:39,929
light. Release. Unload. Sanitize. Go. Oh, I don't like. Wait, what's going on? Why is there a guy

125
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:59,960
with a gun? What? Okay. There's a fire. Hold on. Extinguish. There's a fire in the kitchen.

126
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:17,179
We can't use this. Rat traps. LCS. Toilet clean. Fs. Stop. What was the bug one? Work ticket. Please

127
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:41,740
clean the pest light trap. Oh, trash. Oh, yeah. I remember the TMS. What? I don't have to mash?

128
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:51,080
Okay. Let's do the last one. This is bugs. Please set the roach traps. Set the trap. Sanitize.

129
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,519
And here's another robbery. So it's kick, kick, kick, kick, kick. All right. I get the idea.

130
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:10,390
Let's go. I know how to play. Food catalog, emails, designer, tutorials, tower.

131
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,829
It's an all-new campaign where you can run your cook, serve, delicious restaurant, or work in

132
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:21,349
other restaurants across the tower. Nailed perfect orders. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Getting yum

133
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,109
points. Gain enough yum points. You'll level up. Every fifth rank earns you half a star. Get a full

134
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:37,099
five-star restaurant. Be the best chef in the tower. Good luck. Standard shift. Oh, this all

135
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:46,789
looks good. I want one of these right now. I love this stuff so much. You know, I gotta tell you

136
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:53,779
that pretzels, a hot pretzel is probably the best snack you could ever eat. A big Bavarian pretzel

137
00:17:53,779 --> 00:18:04,599
is just... I'm gonna have to get one. Okay, if I have a meeting later and I have like a big

138
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:19,529
Bavarian pretzel, is that not okay? Or should I just drink water? That's bad. What if I wanted

139
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:25,160
like two big Bavarian pretzels and like mustard and shit and just eat it and talk wicked fucking

140
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:40,839
loud while I'm chewing? All right, let's go. Standard shift. How do I say go? Oh, all right.

141
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:47,420
First time. Complete the day with fewer than eight bad orders. Complete day with fewer than five

142
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,180
average orders. Complete day perfectly. We're not gonna get that. Let's go. Prep any food to start

143
00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:05,960
the day. Let's prep... Let's get the pretzels prepped. Let's prep corn dogs. So I need to do

144
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:16,490
bingo. Close it up. Cook it up. And hold on, hold on, hold on. I need... It's not ready yet.

145
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:25,180
Come on. I need to prep some other stuff too. Oh shit, you want something else? No, no, no, no,

146
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,259
back, back, back, back, back, back. No, no, no, no. Back up. How do I back up? No, just put the

147
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:41,450
fucking hot dogs on. No. What? What do you want on this? Ketchup? He's pissed. I hate these key

148
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:54,490
bindings already. All right, let's go. You want pretzel bun. You want a z and then onion mustard

149
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:05,740
ketchup. M, K, whiz, what? O, N, K, M. What do you got? Okay, I got it, I got it.

150
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:17,319
What do you want? What do you want? You want queso jalapenos beans. So that's Q, J, B. Corn dog.

151
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:26,460
You got it. What do you want? Ketchup. You got it. Toilet. What do you want? Flush it. I gotta prep

152
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:36,940
something else here. Let's prep a few hot dogs. Let's prep. Is that too many? This is too many,

153
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,329
I think. It's all right. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. There's too many hot

154
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:53,140
dogs. This is supposed to be a relaxing stream. Five. Hey, you want ketchup and mustard? Get out.

155
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,589
Get the fuck out of my restaurant. What just happened? What just happened? They just deleted.

156
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:13,930
Why did they delete? Why did they delete? What? What do you want? Open the ice base and fill it.

157
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:25,740
What? All right, hurry up. What do you want? Pretzel bun, mustard, P, no, Z, Z and then M.

158
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:35,819
Get out. Ah, you want pretzel bun, Z, and then ketchup and mustard. Do you want

159
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:47,769
shift? Tab four. Tab three, four. Tab three, four. I don't like this new. I don't like this one.

160
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:57,450
Premium bun, P, onions. Why the fuck is N onions? Why would you not make O onions?

161
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:15,400
No, shift. This is incorrect. Q, S. Am I deleting these? I am. Okay, so if you do it twice,

162
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:30,230
you delete them. C, S. I need something. I'm going out of business. Pretzel. I need. Okay.

163
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:39,109
Why is B pretzel? I've remapped this whole thing. Who's the insane person that decided that B

164
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:45,400
was going to be pretzel and not P? Who's the insane person that said N was going to be onions

165
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:56,619
and not O? Did you use a controller? Well, that's what I did last time. It wasn't a disaster.

166
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:15,779
Hold on. Just plug in. Really? Is it better? Are you feeling relaxed? Do not use a controller. Oh,

167
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:27,450
God. I don't know what to think. Hold on. It's better. It's better. It's better. Hold on. Let

168
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:38,710
me just plug it in. I might have to like restart it. Yeah, I'm quitting. I quit. Why are you not?

169
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:57,029
Let's go. There we go. Okay. Max wieners. Let's try this. You used to learn the keyboard without

170
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:00,490
looking at it. I can't. That's literally impossible. I've been using computers for

171
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,009
25 years and I don't know how to use the keys without looking at it. It's not going to happen.

172
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:09,740
It's impossible. It'll never happen, guys. I'm sorry. This is a thousand times easier, by the

173
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:21,000
way. Let's do pretzels. I like to hold it. Okay. We want German pretzel. Okay. Cook it up. How do

174
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:44,440
I do the second tab? Okay. Wiener. Is it L, B or something? All right. I got pretzels ready.

175
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,390
All right. What do you want? Premium bun. You want a premium bun and you want that's it. Nothing

176
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,549
else. Get out of here. Nobody want a corn dog. You don't want any corn dogs. You want everything

177
00:24:54,549 --> 00:25:01,500
on this. There's a premium bun and then we got everything. We've got everything. Cheese, ketchup,

178
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:13,849
onions. Get out. Nobody wants a pretzel yet. Oh, I have to. Okay. I get it. Anybody else want

179
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:20,660
anything? How do I? Okay. You go. How do I select another station with the controller?

180
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:35,660
You want everything. You want, uh, no. You want queso helping his beans. How do I select them

181
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:46,869
out of a fucking station? Oh God. It's, it's just right on the D pad. Okay. Let's do, uh,

182
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:54,019
corn dogs. Let's put a fucking bunch of them in there. Close it up. Let's go. All right. What

183
00:25:54,019 --> 00:26:08,579
do you want? No, this is bad. You want pretzels. I got a few of them left, right? All right. Here

184
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:16,119
we go. You want mustard on it. Mustard is X. What the fuck do you want? You want mustard is X.

185
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,680
What do you want? You want mustard is X. What do you want? You want, oh fuck. Oh my God. They're

186
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,059
burning. Okay. Regular bun and then everything else. Oh my God. This is so confusing.

187
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:50,539
What did I do wrong? Hold F trigger and what's wrong with this thing? Didn't I just do this?

188
00:26:51,180 --> 00:27:04,940
I think I'm going to rage quit this game by the way. I don't think I want to play this.

189
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,289
This is so much more hectic than the first game by like a thousand times.

190
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:19,700
This isn't cook to serve delicious too. This is cook, serve delicious harder.

191
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:40,150
And then no, no, no, no, no. I went down wrong button. No, you got to prep the shit. It's just,

192
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:48,700
I'm so not used to doing that. I, I don't like the hold and left trigger. Give me the fucking

193
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:56,779
keyboard. No, that's not going to work. Why? Okay. Then left trigger Y, left trigger Y,

194
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:11,579
left trigger X holding and then go and a pretzel. Give it to the rats. He's not relaxing.

195
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:35,079
I've really not. What? What happened? Oh, catch up. What? What happened? I thought I had pretzels

196
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:49,589
here. What the fuck? It's too much for me. Then I already have, do they have, are these ones German?

197
00:28:50,630 --> 00:31:09,670
I don't know. Are they German? Don't press Y again. Passive aggressive.

198
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:23,180
That's not passive aggressive. Yeah. I, I can't, my brain sucks. I can't play this one.

199
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,460
It's cool. I wish I could. I can't. I know I can't. I know I can't. You have to admit when you can't

200
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:36,410
do something. You know what I mean? I'm admitting I can't do it. Do the cash. I don't know. I can't

201
00:31:36,410 --> 00:32:02,180
do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. You can do it. I can't do it. If you wanted to see cook,

202
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,420
serve delicious too, I was like, oh yeah, I can't wait. I just know I'm not going to like it.

203
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,740
I'm certain of it. I liked the first one. I can tell you,

204
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,490
I guarantee I'm not going to like it. Even if I lower the difficulty, I'm just, I'm just telling you.
