1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,210
Zeus, Odin, Agni. Oh, it's gonna be hard. I'm so bad with Agni. I am terrible with Agni.

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,870
All right, boo. How do you play Agni? Tell me in like five steps or less. Oh shit, okay.

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,390
You stun by putting your one down and then putting any of your fire abilities on top of it.

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,060
And then your two is a short-range damage ability. Your three is a dash. Your four is your meter.

5
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,060
Oh dear.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,299
All random, all middle.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,320
Star's gonna be spying on us. What is with this item menu? How do I just find items?

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,710
Alright, I'm just gonna get boots, I think. I don't know. I've never played Agni, ever.

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,229
Anybody but Agni. I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say, get anyone out of y'all guys, but.

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,270
Remember. Yeah, I've seen you play Hevo before.

11
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,020
Consumable.

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,650
Well, I actually spec'd the first one, right? Okay. Alright, so what should I get? My two first, two late. I already did it.

13
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,659
Look at this. Look at this map. This map is insane. Yeah, it's cool.

15
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,340
I wonder how much gold you get a second. So you cannot recall. I have no idea what I'm buying. I'm just gonna buy stuff.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,400
Oh, but you got Ares. It's not too terrible.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,680
Yeah, he's okay. I would have preferred, uh, I would have had Agni any day.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
I know. Can we like change characters? Like I would be more comfortable with him. Oh god, the confusion sets in.

19
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,629
Anybody but Agni. You know what? I'm just going in. You want to go in?

20
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm scared. I can't find this book. I'm following this build guide and I can't find this book. Who's Poseidon?

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,079
No, Gavin's Poseidon. No, I wish I had. God. Gavin, you better carry.

22
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,700
Magical power, maybe. So wait, Gavin. Alright, here we go. There we go. I found. Okay. Do we get lanes? Yeah, we get lanes. Okay.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,319
I have to read up on my build. I've never played Hevo before.

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,199
Basically, yeah. Yeah, really really squishy. That's what I know. Star has Agni too. Level up to 3 and you won.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,919
Yeah, okay. Your 3 is the safest move. Yeah, I expect that first.

26
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:24,099
Alright, let me get a nice. Oh my god. Oh god. Star, are you still on the call? Star's taking a beating.

27
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,780
Oh, did Star drop out of the call to like not hear our strats? Oh, that monkey. I think he's here. He's just like spying on us.

28
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,939
Okay, everybody move in now. Uh oh. No, not moving. What do you mean moving now?

29
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
I was trying to trick Star.

30
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,539
So do you have to die? Like you have to die, right? Yeah.

31
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,819
God, I don't. How the hell do you play Agni?

32
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,180
That monkey, bro. Yeah, that monkey is strong. Save your monkey for when the minions are dead.

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,180
Because then you can get. That's what I've been doing, yeah.

34
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:02,340
Look at these minions. These minions are crazy looking. They're like demons. Look at this guy. Yeah, they're demons. They're god damn demons.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,210
Here comes an Agni, rogue Agni, dashing through. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:14,050
Oh, get punished him. Punish him. Punish him. Yeah, Gavin. Yeah, high res Gavin. Go on, Gavin.

37
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:18,080
Clean it up. Ow.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,979
So we gotta get both towers and then, okay. Oh my god, they go to Zeus.

39
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,379
This is gonna take a while, I feel like. This is gonna be like an hour long game.

40
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,479
Dancing around so much. Here comes Cage.

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,300
No.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,099
Oh god, that was horrible. Get that, son of a bitch.

43
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,000
Get that Ramana.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jesus. Oh, yeah. Oh.

45
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,259
I got a kill.

46
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,860
Yay.

47
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
I got someone. There you go. There you go.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Get him. Get him. Good job, boo. Looking good. Looking good. Looking good.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
Oh god. Oh, that Zeus is just doing so much damage.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,080
It hurts.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,240
All right, so get. We gotta get two towers.

52
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,139
Holy. Oh my god. We gotta get high enough level where they're dead. Yeah. For a long time.

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,480
Holy sheep shit. This is gonna be tough.

54
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,579
We got this. I need more mana. Right. Is it just Zeus? Is it just Zeus?

55
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,790
Boo's running. He's gonna try to suicide, but Zeus is chasing him.

56
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,300
Get that. Get that, son of a. Get him. Boo, turn around.

57
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,420
Boo, turn around. Hit him once. Oh, I got him. I got him. I got him.

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,850
Boo's just like running into the tower.

59
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,490
I was wondering what you were doing.

60
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,649
I mean, if you feed the kill to the tower, then they don't get any XP or gold for it.

61
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,379
Are you sure? But he wasn't hitting me. I'm too tanky.

62
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,009
It's like four towers.

63
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,970
We should all build stone of Gaia so we just have permanent health regen.

64
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,850
Oh, I'll get bracer replenishment. There we go. That'll be good. That's perfect for me.

65
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,470
You should probably buy. Oh, going in on the Agni. Going in on the Agni.

66
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,139
Nice.

67
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,819
No, I'm in the cage.

68
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,259
He'll die fast. What? Can't believe I got him. Can we get him? Nice.

69
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,019
He jumped out. Oh, that was pretty good. Oh, I'm going down. See you later.

70
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh boy, whole team.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,850
This is gonna get really interesting really quickly here. We gotta go magical. Where is this the hootie?

72
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,329
There you are. We got magic.

73
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,779
Yeah, that's that Zeus is doing a lot of damage. I'm following this one guy that may just be crap, but

74
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,779
it's better than nothing.

75
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,779
Uh-oh, they're on the tower.

76
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,339
I'll make it happen, boo. Make it happen. I'm on the move. Make it happen. Back to the action, baby.

77
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,550
Uh-oh, boo. Be careful. Get that kill on him.

78
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,110
Yes.

79
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,110
Good job, boo. All right, we're up. We're up. You're going big.

80
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,110
Oh, we got it. We got it. That Harry's bro. Damn.

81
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:21,860
Get a move on. I don't want to. All right, it's Kelly.

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,519
All right, we oh boy. There it goes.

83
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,430
That was my bad.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,790
Get out of here.

85
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,550
Uh-oh, big baby.

86
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,350
How did I not? Oh, she ages. I'm so bad.

87
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,490
Oh, no. Oh, I'm dead.

88
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
It hurts. Get that Agni. Just hit him.

89
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,189
Oh, come on. Nice job.

90
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,550
Ah, he can't go back. Yeah, we got to attack that tower now. Yeah, they get three down.

91
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,230
I wish one of us had a damn heal.

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,430
Yeah, I'm getting bracelet replenishment. I should have got that earlier. I didn't think regen would be as important as it would be.

93
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,259
Stone a guy it would be. Oh god.

94
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,259
Are we going to get the tower? Ah, it hurts. It hurts. Get that tower, Talix.

95
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,379
I'm tanking it. I can't tank it.

96
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,899
It's almost down. It's almost down. Meditation would be okay in this mode.

97
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,579
Yeah. Let's go with some defense.

98
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,180
I got some medias.

99
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,800
That Kali is going to eat media. That Kali keeps killing me.

100
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,220
Well, we're going to have five down here. I got that.

101
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,490
How did I miss? Oh,

102
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,620
come on.

103
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
I'm trying. It's just me and her.

104
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
It's just me and the Kali.

105
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,439
Yeah, say goodbye to your lane, bro.

106
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,139
Not sure if this is the best call, but I'll try it. That's right. Damn it.

107
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,810
Void stone.

108
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm coming back. I'm pushing her up, pushing her up. Here comes Vamana.

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
What if there was a fire giant?

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,540
Jerm, I'm coming. Help me.

111
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
Kali's almost dead.

112
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,189
Her heal is pretty damn good, though.

113
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,199
I need to wait for these things to charge up.

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,039
All right, coming back.

115
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,639
I'm going to try and hit Kali.

116
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,860
We're going to put some damage on this tower. We're going to punish.

117
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,700
Mayjack's Blessing is expensive.

118
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Ah, it hurts. It hurts.

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,470
Oh, Lord.

120
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,909
It hurts when I pee.

121
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:53,789
Oh, Gavin.

122
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,179
Gavin.

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
You three dudes, I'm coming.

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,610
Okay, listen.

125
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,570
Damn, I got her. Nice.

126
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,409
Get me the hell out of there.

127
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,779
Oh, God. I may.

128
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:12,559
No.

129
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,019
Fancy footwork. Fancy footwork.

130
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,779
Got the stun. I got the stun.

131
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,269
Get the Odin first.

132
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,070
Oh, nice wave.

133
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,559
Let's go with the Rod.

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,330
And Krone spin it.

135
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,850
One more. One more.

136
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,730
Kill this Agni, and then we'll push tower.

137
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,049
Oh, you guys are going to get it? You guys are going to get that tower?

138
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,409
Damn it. I missed.

139
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,049
Get start.

140
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:41,490
Why are we pushing?

141
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,049
Oh, that's a DSI. That's a DSI. Get the tower.

142
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,940
Go, go, go, go, go.

143
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,899
There's blue. I need my heals.

144
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,100
Oh, there's so much time.

145
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,700
There's so much time right now.

146
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,539
Oh, God. But I'm dead, though.

147
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,899
You guys are all so dead.

148
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,899
Look at that wave.

149
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,700
Lovely region.

150
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:57,940
Boo, you have to, right?

151
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,240
Yep.

152
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,340
Just do it. You have to, right? Even if you die.

153
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,059
Even if you guys die, this tower should go down.

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,539
Oh, Callie's up.

155
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,259
I'll retreat.

156
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:11,909
No.

157
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,710
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,210
Don't.

159
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:13,909
Get down.

160
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,210
Good job. Good job.

161
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:16,929
Beautiful.

162
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:17,649
I think we can kill him.

163
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,149
Now run.

164
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,409
I'm up.

165
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,429
Let's jump.

166
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,470
Oh, good job.

167
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:24,190
Good job, guys.

168
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,549
There we go.

169
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,029
Big plays.

170
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:26,669
Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,169
Big plays.

172
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,870
Here comes Zeus.

173
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,190
He's real angry. He wants a double.

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,450
Yeah, it's pretty much it's all about the just going in.

175
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,809
Even if you die from the tower, it's still it's it's worth it because

176
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,409
you have to get the towers down.

177
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,529
All right. We just don't want to all wipe and give them full free reign to do the same thing back to us.

178
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,629
So we got to try to stay alive.

179
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,750
Oh, get tripled.

180
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,480
That's me.

181
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,990
All right, guys.

182
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,990
Oh, my goodness gracious.

183
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,110
I came out and Insta died.

184
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,389
I did get I did help, though.

185
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:18,139
I'm killing.

186
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,419
That's what I'm doing.

187
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,220
I think Boo's killing.

188
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,779
Oh, Boo.

189
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,379
I'm here to fight it.

190
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,460
Well, that was unnecessary.

191
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,299
Oh, come on.

192
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:30,860
One hit.

193
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,659
Got her.

194
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,639
I need to buy an Aegis.

195
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,139
All right.

196
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm going to regenerate it.

197
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:38,850
You're there.

198
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,350
All right.

199
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:41,470
The Odin's pretty low.

200
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,220
Ah, missed.

201
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,899
If I if I chain him, he'll die.

202
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,399
Oh, nice.

203
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,000
He's done.

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,389
I've got to make this happen.

205
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,659
Can't you use the portal in this one?

206
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,419
That's what I was wondering if you could use a portal somehow to get back.

207
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,059
You probably can.

208
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,259
If I can just catch this guy.

209
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,340
They got three down.

210
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,840
Three down.

211
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,059
Agnestead.

212
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,559
Yep.

213
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Oh, we got to get them all here.

214
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,379
Got to get them all here.

215
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,600
Nice.

216
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,059
Now we push.

217
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:11,559
That's it.

218
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,059
We're going to get it.

219
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:12,559
We're going to get it.

220
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,059
We're going to get Phoenix.

221
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Somebody's got to come up a few seconds.

222
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,299
We got Zeus in six seconds.

223
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:17,860
Zeus in six seconds.

224
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,360
Zeus will die.

225
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,700
We'll just we'll just smash Zeus.

226
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,200
All right.

227
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,700
Let's go.

228
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Let's go.

229
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,200
Come on minions.

230
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Let's go.

231
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,379
I'm on the move.

232
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,500
Get to Phoenix.

233
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,220
I got I got a minions.

234
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,860
I got a minions.

235
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,580
Here comes Zeus.

236
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,139
Oh, that hurt.

237
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm on the move.

238
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,580
Now it's just the Minotaur.

239
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:43,850
Oh, shit.

240
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,169
Yeah.

241
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:44,669
Ow.

242
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,169
He's detonating.

243
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:46,730
Waiting first.

244
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,730
Was he got a bunch of cooldown reduction?

245
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,559
No, he's just detonating before his.

246
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,600
Should we dive the Minotaur?

247
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,100
What do you think?

248
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,529
Do we just dive the Minotaur?

249
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:55,929
I don't know.

250
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:56,730
Boo's pretty weak.

251
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,850
Jerma's pretty weak.

252
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,250
I know.

253
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,289
But I mean, I'm going to drop some medias on him.

254
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,970
We're going to have fire minions soon, too.

255
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,570
Guys, I'm coming in hot.

256
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,210
Oh, jeez.

257
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,029
Plus the Minotaur's not too right now.

258
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:08,750
Oh, boo.

259
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,320
I almost killed him.

260
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,460
Did you get anyone?

261
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,059
I almost got the Zeus.

262
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:16,700
They can't regen, though.

263
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,340
They can't regen.

264
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,299
So that's fine.

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,559
Oh, boy.

266
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:27,929
Bang.

267
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm already in one.

268
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,159
Good job.

269
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,799
Oh, I'm caged.

270
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm caged.

271
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,639
I'm caged.

272
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,570
Just run around.

273
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,129
Just run around.

274
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:37,610
Don't run away.

275
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,409
Just fight him.

276
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:38,909
I can't.

277
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,470
All right, go for the Zeus.

278
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,190
He's more dangerous.

279
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,190
I mean, you don't have to.

280
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,830
We're about to die.

281
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:46,830
Actually, just fall back here.

282
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,629
Yeah, I'm falling back.

283
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,269
Run.

284
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:54,809
Damn it.

285
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,580
Damn it.

286
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,649
I got my charge.

287
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,039
All right, you want to go in on the Zeus?

288
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,360
Oh, wait.

289
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,159
No, crap.

290
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,679
I just don't want to get caged.

291
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,240
Oh, the Zeus.

292
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,799
I'm going on the Zeus.

293
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,519
I'm going to kill the Zeus.

294
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,679
There's an Odin coming behind you.

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,429
Well, there's Ulster.

296
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:18,409
One more.

297
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:19,850
Did I get him?

298
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,330
Got him.

299
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,649
There you go.

300
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:20,970
Yep.

301
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,769
Oh, boy.

302
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:22,169
You're dead.

303
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:22,570
You're dead.

304
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:23,929
No, I'm not.

305
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:24,809
Don't say it.

306
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:25,450
I'll just kite around.

307
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:25,769
Kite around.

308
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,090
Kite around.

309
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,809
Go, go, go, go, go.

310
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:27,289
All three.

311
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:27,929
He's going to die.

312
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:28,649
He's going to die.

313
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:29,210
Get that kill.

314
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,929
Get that kill.

315
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:30,970
Oh, my God.

316
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,610
Get that kill.

317
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,129
There you go.

318
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:34,190
There you go.

319
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,750
All right.

320
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,070
All right.

321
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:41,529
I need to, what do I need?

322
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,730
I have shits on a gold.

323
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,370
I know, me too.

324
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,039
You get full gold a second.

325
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,600
All right.

326
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,429
Let's go with Sprint.

327
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,139
So we both have what, one down?

328
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:52,860
They got two down.

329
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,460
Me and Gavin versus all three of these guys

330
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,019
ain't going to fly.

331
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,620
I got no health.

332
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,159
Yeah, that's the idea.

333
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,360
That's kind of the thing.

334
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm just dropping medias around.

335
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,679
I'm dropping medias around the corner.

336
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,039
I just did so much damage.

337
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,799
I just did so much damage to like two or three of them.

338
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,590
Get a stun.

339
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,840
Oh, no.

340
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,730
You just run away from me.

341
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,639
Yeah, I'm going to die.

342
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,559
Oh, we're in trouble.

343
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,600
We're in a lot of trouble here.

344
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,019
I just got back.

345
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:36,159
Let's use.

346
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,200
Ah, he hurts.

347
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,759
No, he doesn't.

348
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,259
Never mind.

349
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,350
Damn it.

350
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:49,419
I'm trying to wait for the opportunity for my ulti.

351
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,139
I don't.

352
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,360
You just got to go right through somebody.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,860
Nice one.

354
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,809
Nice cracking.

355
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,250
Get him.

356
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,289
Star's the only one left.

357
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,309
He could pull off something crazy.

358
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:05,950
Get the kill.

359
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,129
They just flame lift.

360
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:08,529
There we go.

361
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:09,570
He's dead.

362
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,210
All right, let's go.

363
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

364
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,429
This is our moment, guys.

365
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:16,269
We have so far to go.

366
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,830
You know that you walk faster on my water, right?

367
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,230
Yep.

368
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,029
Now we do, yeah.

369
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,980
Don't worry, guys.

370
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,100
I'll be there momentarily.

371
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,070
There we go.

372
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,070
We got two seconds on Kali being up.

373
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,029
This is going to be so difficult.

374
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:32,909
Oh, Phoenix is...

375
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,230
Where's our Phoenix?

376
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,350
We haven't had a Phoenix regen the whole game.

377
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,049
Oh, my God.

378
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:42,690
She's solo.

379
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,450
I almost killed her with that.

380
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,210
I got her with the tick.

381
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,580
Sick.

382
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,840
All right, we got a key.

383
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,000
They're all about two more about to come back up.

384
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
The mana and Odin.

385
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,720
This is it.

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,279
It's going down.

387
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,799
Let's get it.

388
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,360
Do everything.

389
00:16:58,529 --> 00:16:59,490
Oh, baby.

390
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,370
Oh, baby.

391
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,340
Did we kill her?

392
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,840
Yay.

393
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:06,430
Good job, guys.

394
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,930
Seriously.

395
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,650
It's intense.
