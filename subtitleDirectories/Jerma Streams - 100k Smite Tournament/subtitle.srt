1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,790
That shit does not want you to know what the fuck was that you all the new players learn and they get used to it.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,880
It's really bad. All right.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,679
I'm live now.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,880
Can somebody confirm in my house Russell?

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:15,820
Oh shit.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,920
We're missing a player.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,719
Yeah, how do you sprint?

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,620
Is it autosprint?

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,120
You're always moving the full speed as long as you're autoing you slow down.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,719
That's the only way you slow down or someone says we literally don't have our fifth player.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,689
Oh, you're like 12.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,090
Yeah, how do I learn my abilities?

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,990
How do I see my bill?

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,689
Okay, got it.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,289
Can you press K to read them or just add the F keys?

16
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,189
F1, F2, F3.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,119
All right guys.

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,219
Hi, it's me, German985.

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:47,820
Welcome.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,920
I told you about this smite tournament that I'm in.

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,619
I'm going to give you just a very quick rundown of what's going to happen here.

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,619
So everybody in chat can yell at the other people that come into chat in like 10 minutes

23
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,820
yelling at me as to why I have not like crashed car and laughed about it.

24
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,319
Like we did a couple nights ago.

25
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,219
This is a very important tournament.

26
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,019
This is a hundred thousand dollar smite tournament.

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,900
Mizkif is hosting it.

28
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,900
I'm taking this pretty seriously.

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm going to try as best I can.

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,400
No cam.

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,599
We're doing I'm in a call.

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,400
I got my team here.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,299
I'm a team captain.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,700
He's doing his team.

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,500
Yeah, I'm doing my TF2 voice because I have to be able to talk and then tell people where I am.

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,260
And yes, I'm in my underwear and playing completely naked because I wasn't ready.

37
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,159
Couldn't take a shower.

38
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,560
It started to kind of early Pacific time.

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,719
So I've literally have I've got hardly clothes on.

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,530
So just for you to know that.

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,879
Okay.

42
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,870
So I'm going to jump back in here.

43
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,739
We have my best friend poke.

44
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,340
You should probably saw from that tweet.

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,180
He's what is poke playing?

46
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,379
I guess we just go over it in the roles.

47
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,489
It's me sure for poke no-go Russell and our coaches weekend.

48
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,560
You can I'm sure you probably watching poke stream probably by this point.

49
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,060
All right.

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,459
Here we go.

51
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,959
But I yeah, I'm going to be serious.

52
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,560
No cam.

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,959
I'm not going to be like, oh, hey, look at me.

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm a fucking dickhead.

55
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,939
No, this is serious gamer time right now.

56
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,139
This is a hundred thousand dollar tournament.

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,259

58
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:12,860
You guys get it.

59
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,460
You get it.

60
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
This is just my perspective.

61
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,159
If you want to go watch the big stream, that's on ms.

62
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,860
Kiff's channel.

63
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Why don't you stay here?

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay.

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,199
All right.

66
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,000
Look at me.

67
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,490
That's my support character Aries.

68
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,789
All right.

69
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,729

75
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,530
I like the whips.

76
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,229
I like all of it.

77
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:41,830
You know what I'm saying?

78
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,169
Oh, yeah.

79
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:45,550

No, I did.

94
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,259
I did.

95
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:11,560
I did.

96
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm playing right now.

97
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,960
The only thing is, is when I, when I attack people, the fucking

98
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,460
blood splatters bigger than my forehead.

99
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,759
So like, well, how do I get that off?

100
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,259
Like, yeah.

101
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm playing.

102
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,159
You got banned.

103
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:25,860
Yeah.

104
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,360
It says the owner of this website, high red studios has banned

105
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,460
you temporary from accessing accessing this website.

106
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,259
Refreshing a little bit too much.

107
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,389
Who are you playing?

108
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,620
No Cosmo is a Nami.

109
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,719
What does this do?

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,919
It might be the skin.

111
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,419
You have one.

112
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,419
If you do, did you buy a skin?

113
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,219
Did you have a skin on?

114
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,020
Yeah.

115
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,110
This thing see that no, it's crits.

116
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,560
You see it.

117
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,259
I'm going in.

118
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:51,860
I'll check.

119
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,240
Yeah.

120
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,039
I am not going to lie.

121
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,939
I need drops.

122
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,639
Yeah.

123
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,240
I think it works now.

124
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,240
I drops enabled.

125
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
Can I can anybody cry?

126
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,740
Is it a drops actually enabled on my channel at least?

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,259
Yeah, they are.

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,759
Okay.

129
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,159
You guys drops are enabled.

130
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:07,289
That would be embarrassing if they weren't.

131
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,969
Oh, you're talking about the numbers on your screen that are

132
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:11,270
huge.

133
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,969
Yeah.

134
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,569
Yeah.

135
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,569
Can't change that thing.

136
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,569
So now that you mentioned it, I mean double check the numbers.

137
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,069
That shit is fucking huge.

138
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh, try now.

139
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,649
You can't jump.

140
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,250
That's awkward.

141
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,050
Yeah, you can you can you can it should be low.

142
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,449
You just can't auto and jump.

143
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:30,649
Yeah.

144
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,680
No, you can't use abilities and do it at the same time.

145
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,079
Okay.

146
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,180
It's combat scaling.

147
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,279
I think is what you want to turn down.

148
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,480
It's under user interface.

149
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:37,959
All right.

150
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:49,449
Yeah, again, for people just coming in now, this is again,

151
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,550
I'm going to make this really clear.

152
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,149
This is a gamer stream.

153
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,850
I've got a team here.

154
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,750
I'm the team captain.

155
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
We've been practicing.

156
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,550
Well, we did a little bit last night.

157
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,050
This is $100,000 tournament, no cam, no comedy.

158
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,149
This is not going to be that's not going to be a funny stream.

159
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,350
This is going to be like a we're playing the game trying to

160
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,850
win a hundred thousand goddamn dollars.

161
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,149
Okay, there's a hundred thousand dollars.

162
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,100
You understand I'm not going to like I'm not going to jump

163
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,709
into a tower and talk about like Dunkin Donuts today.

164
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,910
Like this is for $100,000 that not today.

165
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,389
I'm being serious today.

166
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:24,810
They're only thousand viewers.

167
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,810
That can't be right.

168
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,610
That actually can't be right.

169
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,980
That can't be right.

170
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,079
Now.

171
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,680
I only have a thousand viewers right now.

172
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,649
Whatever.

173
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,949
Okay, this is a gamer stream.

174
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
But yeah, I'm actually going to try to take it seriously.

175
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,279
We'll have fun.

176
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,879
Don't worry.

177
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,569
Don't worry.

178
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,769
Green screen stream is in like two days.

179
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,269
Relax.

180
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:56,949
True.

181
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,649
Also like what combos well with Ares anything?

182
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,149
Yeah, they both do both of those will be fine.

183
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,649
Artemis like you'll do a lot for the lane as Ares you should

184
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,550
clear and do a lot.

185
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,949
So Artemis will be fine.

186
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,949
And if you want to go for kills, you also do a lot of damage

187
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,350
on Ares.

188
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:18,949
Okay, so let me just for my brain again speed attack mid lane

189
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,649
then go wherever I want.

190
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,250
Make sure those three minute timers bang, bang, bang.

191
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,550
Make sure blue is dropped for solo every time.

192
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,250
That's I've got that right, right?

193
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,050
Yep.

194
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:28,550
All right.

195
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,050
Got it.

196
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Yeah, I think I think I understand this character a lot.

197
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,019
This is like a perfect character for me.

198
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,519
That works go if you can like close out of this and I want

199
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,319
you to go in a regular game just so you know where to start

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,819
like what to do at the very beginning of the game.

201
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
We have time.

202
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,620
Yeah, they said 330 would be when we started so it should

203
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,220
take like one minute.

204
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,879
Okay, so we have good sir three dirty as I'm like three

205
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,680
dirty EST.

206
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,379
Yeah, okay.

207
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,379
So I go to where go to you just go to training and go to

208
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,079
conquest.

209
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,379
I'm not going to buy the burger skin.

210
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:09,180
I don't even play with that character go to play and then

211
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,579
training.

212
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,920
This is in queue training and then conquest and then do easy

213
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,220
bots.

214
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,920
Just the first one and quick play.

215
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,620
Yeah, it'll start the game up.

216
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,920
These kids are fun sick guys.

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
I'm going to tell you I'm just going to be really realistic

218
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,519
here.

219
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,620
People will we win the smite tournament?

220
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,620
I think at least one or two people have just installed

221
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,519
the game an hour ago on the team.

222
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,220
I don't I don't think we're going to get to the end will

223
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,519
do probably be okay.

224
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,620
We'll probably do.

225
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,220
All right.

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,279
I can't buy the cheeseburger skin.

227
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,180
I don't play with the cheeseburger character.

228
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:58,490
I believe I believe would you say retirement?

229
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:03,300
Stream wait, would you say I need to know what you said?

230
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh embarrassment stream it.

231
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,399
I'm telling you my I might surprise some people here

232
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,100
because I the last couple days I really talked I took this

233
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,899
pretty seriously.

234
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
I was like what character do I want to play?

235
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,500
I want to get familiar with it.

236
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,000
But guys I've played smite for like a thousand hours.

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
This is obviously like five six seven years ago now, but

238
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,800
whatever.

239
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:22,629
I think I'll do okay.

240
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,240
And look if I'm if I go 0 and 10 then then I'll buy then

241
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,740
I'll tell a couple of jokes.

242
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,339
Okay, and then we can relax.

243
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,100
I think we've got a good chance.

244
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,940
I really do although not maybe not the first game if we're

245
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,840
playing the top seed first.

246
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
So this will be a great indication if we do.

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,990
Okay, if we actually beat this team, apparently this is

248
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,950
one of the better teams, right?

249
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,450
You know what I'm saying?

250
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,720
But what I'm saying is essentially is this free points.

251
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,960
I don't think we're going to win the tournament, but I

252
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,659
could be wrong.

253
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,149
I'm just excited to participate should be fun.

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,379
It's probably auto.

255
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,179
No, no your two is what you want at the beginning.

256
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh, so you want two and then one then three you'll level

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,179
your three second.

258
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,379
Just so you have a safety ability to like run away, but

259
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:14,580
you're going to match your two your one your alt and then

260
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,980
your three.

261
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,179
So just one just curious.

262
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,279
Should I be should I be auto build as Aries or should I

263
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,480
have a specific build?

264
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,879
Realistically, I'll write you out a build right now.

265
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,679
It's trying to help you because I don't know what the

266
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,679
auto builds are building and everything.

267
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,580
So weird why I mean, I was just going to look up a build

268
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,179
so I do appreciate that you also.

269
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:40,279
Yeah, this game apparently this jungler because I'm a

270
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,879
jungler.

271
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,679
I figured that because we were talking in the in the

272
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,779
before a couple days ago.

273
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,879
It was like, okay, who knows how to play the game?

274
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,679
It's like I do sure for does I think poke said he played

275
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,080
for a little bit Russell said he's played it like years

276
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,879
ago, but I think like me and sure for had the most game

277
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,779
knowledge, right?

278
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,000
So it's like, okay, I so I kind of had to play jungle

279
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,799
even though I'm you know, we're talking we're talking

280
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,600
Little League, right?

281
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,220
If you take the best Little League player in the world,

282
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,860
he's going to get struck out by a Major League Baseball

283
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,259
player.

284
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,370
I'm just that's just a fact.

285
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,269
So right.

286
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:21,169
That's what we're doing.

287
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,230
What do you mean wrong?

288
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,860
And by the way, they're all these are all gamers in the

289
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,600
practice last night sure for was fucking dominating poke

290
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,500
dominating.

291
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm not concerned.

292
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I think we're going to be fine.

293
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,100
It's I'm going to turn out to be the Little League batboy.

294
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,179
I'm not even on the Little League team.

295
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:50,070
You'll see or whenever you can safely just grab that go

296
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,769
back to your lane.

297
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,870
And then whenever that blue buff respawns you want to do

298
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,970
that every single time.

299
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,759
And I should be just I should just upgrade one three and

300
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,259
then two.

301
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,659
Well, obviously for whenever I can but okay, and then

302
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,159
no-go.

303
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,960
I just type the build in the chat.

304
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:13,960
It's the same build folks going so you're just going to

305
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,360
do that.

306
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:14,960
Same thing.

307
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
Both the first second third and it doesn't matter about

308
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,960
last hitting.

309
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,159
It gives you extra gold if you all this whole time.

310
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,960
I was like, whatever.

311
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,659
Oh, no, I got a blast it then you don't in this game.

312
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,659
You don't do it like you definitely want to try but you

313
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,360
don't do it like League.

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,159
It's not you sit there.

315
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,059
You wait if you just want to power clear the lane as fast

316
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:30,559
as possible.

317
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,059
I think we're getting a we should be getting in Lobby

318
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:35,460
soon, right?

319
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,159
Oh, it is a way your autos are a ways.

320
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,159
Yeah, they go through creeps.

321
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,860
And then I'm not my way my my to do.

322
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,259
Yep.

323
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,159
So you'll just auto into it and it should clear very quick.

324
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,460
You're one of the fastest clearing character.

325
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,059
So what are we doing?

326
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,759
Whoa, what happened?

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,899
We have 10 minutes.

328
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,000
So they said we were I think you guys are going to be in

329
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,399
a party or in the custom game pretty soon.

330
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,570
Great.

331
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,759
I have not my mom my notifications turned off.

332
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,659
Why would that even happen?

333
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,120
So we should we should get in a party then right?

334
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,990
Okay, let's do that because somebody just tried to like

335
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,590
add me to their fucking party.

336
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,289
And there's some we got it.

337
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:32,190
We got to go away from that.

338
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,279
I think I have all of your in-game names, but I don't

339
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,580
have Russell.

340
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,080
I don't have you and I don't have no go.

341
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,350
You want to type your in-game names?

342
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,149
I'm watching.

343
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,899
I'm watching Russell Russell, right?

344
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,899
Oops, my mic Russell is literally like down in the game

345
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,299
right now and watching the tutorial.

346
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,299
What'd you say?

347
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,600
You're downloading the game right now and watching a YouTube

348
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,000
tutorial.

349
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,799
How to play smite.

350
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,399
What are you doing?

351
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,399
I've had this game since 2013.

352
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,399
Are you doing man?

353
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,500
Excuse me.

354
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,299
Wait, are you guys waiting for me?

355
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,799
Yeah, just waiting on the video.

356
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,299
Are you watching the in-game embedded YouTube video?

357
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:23,860
Do they still do that?

358
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:26,059

359
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,470
I don't I don't I want to go on his down.

360
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,860

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,559
me super me automatically and then you're gonna want to

362
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:39,960
turn that off.

363
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
If you press look, I think it's Kay.

364
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,159
Are you in game still?

365
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah, press K and see if it says that right there.

366
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,759
And if not, it'll turn off that's auto skill.

367
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,659
You can turn that off.

368
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
And then you can close that.

369
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,860
So who are we missing in the party?

370
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,559
He's in a game.

371
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,659
Yeah, I can leave.

372
00:13:58,659 --> 00:13:59,059
I can leave.

373
00:13:59,059 --> 00:13:59,460
I'm gonna leave.

374
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,799
I think they're gonna give us they're gonna give us the

375
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,600
the ID.

376
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,299
I think soon.

377
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,000
Is anyone nervous?

378
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,899
I'm just curious.

379
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm not saying I am but I was asking if anyone here.

380
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh God, I hear no, I've already accepted.

381
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,700
If we go if we go like oh and 30 because there's a voice

382
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,799
chat in game.

383
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,899
Why don't why are you like unhappy about that?

384
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,700
Sure for because I don't want to hear anyone twice.

385
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,500
Oh, okay.

386
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,399
Well, that's understandable.

387
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,899
I want to hear you guys only once for pure clarity.

388
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Okay.

389
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,799
I just did push the toggle.

390
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,500
So you should hear me twice.

391
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,470
No, I just have the Jabberwockies the Jabberwockies.

392
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,470
Are you talking about stuff?

393
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,970
That's not who I was thinking of.

394
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,970
Tell them to watch your smite video.

395
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,169
I dropped your starter items in there and then your full

396
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,269
build is the one right after.

397
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,169
Each of the volume.

398
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,070
Okay.

399
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:51,470
All right.

400
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,970
Sounds good.

401
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,600
Should I turn off auto build before we get in the game?

402
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,799
Then?

403
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah, I would you can do it in settings.

404
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,019
I think if anybody wants to know how to play that's a pretty

405
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,019
good tutorials back in like 2012.

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,919
If anyone was curious how to play the game.

407
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,019
You have smite Wario's.

408
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,620
Yeah, I bought I bought this back in 2013.

409
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,720
So I probably watched it.

410
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,019
Yeah, it's guides for actually have a guide for Aries if

411
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:19,720
you want to watch it.

412
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,919
It's probably got some good tips in it.

413
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,019
I'm going to go watch that right now immediately.

414
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,820
It's on your second or first channel.

415
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
It's on the first first channel.

416
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,919
It's definitely worth watching.

417
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,169
I'd say it's not something that I wish I deleted but it's

418
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:33,870
funny deleted.

419
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,269
Oh, yeah.

420
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,769
If you guys aren't in the game by the way, you can press

421
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,970
escape and then go to guides and turn everything you want

422
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,070
off all right there.

423
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,269
Gold Fury is like very guide.

424
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,970
Yeah, do it says guides.

425
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:46,970
I have an okay.

426
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,669
Let me just with with you guys here.

427
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,070
I have an Aries video, right?

428
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,570
I did like three or four of them didn't I?

429
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,169
Self promo.

430
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,370
I don't give a fuck about that video.

431
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,669
I would delete it right now if I could.

432
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,740
Don't I have?

433
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah, I did.

434
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,039
Did I delete it?

435
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,539
I might have deleted it is just the Anubis one the only

436
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,240
one that's left.

437
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,139
Is it still there?

438
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh man, is it still?

439
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,539
Oh, it's there.

440
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,840
Okay, that's funny.

441
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,919
All right, let's go.

442
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,480
Are your abilities at the queue?

443
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,980
No, sorry, it's two two first two first two level your

444
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,440
three of ones and then match your one match your two

445
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,740
your one you're all your three.

446
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,139
Wait, what's the title of the video?

447
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,440
It's this what is it?

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
Oh, man.

449
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,440
What does it say?

450
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
This dude's a beast.

451
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,299
Holy shit.

452
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,529
I was trying so hard Aries God of War.

453
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,830
This dude's a beast.

454
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,129
Might be I hope I hope he watches it and hey by the way,

455
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,629
I'm gonna act like yeah, like did you get anything from

456
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:57,929
that?

457
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,279
No, like yeah, did you get something from that?

458
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,080
Like I hope you did.

459
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:02,179
I think I'm kidding.

460
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:03,279
You know, hopefully you learned something.

461
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,480
Q w e r q w e r.

462
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,779
Yeah, that's like way better for me.

463
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,049
Hold on settings abilities.

464
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,630
You just can't change your w or you won't be able to walk

465
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,529
I was gonna say it's gonna I feel like that's gonna fuck

466
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:19,130
with you more.

467
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,869
Are you sure you want to switch this no-co?

468
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,970
No, 100% because I played League for a really long time.

469
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,569
All right, man.

470
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,269
I believe you.

471
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:33,829
You're breaking your no comedy rule.

472
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:37,130
We're not playing the no comedy serious.

473
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,230
Rule is only for when I'm in the actual game.

474
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,819
I'm not probably not gonna look at chat really much at all.

475
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:51,029
The no comedy rules only for game moments.

476
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,369
Are y'all getting the battle pass?

477
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,069
I think I bought it already.

478
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,950
I don't know how much even is this in like money?

479
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,359
Wait, how do you battle past trying to think?

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,660
It's q w e r is League.

481
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:28,720
What's 16,000 gems.

482
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,619
I've never had this many gems in my whole life.

483
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,319
This whole game.

484
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,519
Do you feel freaking rich right now?

485
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,950
I just I am like I look up at there and I'm just like I just

486
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,349
I bought the 400 gem bakasura metal skin.

487
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,440
It's like I kind of feel like I need to have one of the crazy

488
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,839
ones.

489
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,440
Does box or have a crazy one?

490
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
That's some pretty good skins.

491
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,000
They're not nuts.

492
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,900
The craziest one.

493
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,799
You probably can't buy unless they gave it to you.

494
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
This is the one I'm going to be using sick.

495
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,460
Oh, wait, I can play.

496
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,259
Is this the stranger things?

497
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,140
Oh, yeah, special nuts crazy.

498
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,240
You walk around kind of creepy.

499
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I don't but I don't know.

500
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,579
Okay, can I buy this if I've never seen an episode of stranger

501
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:12,980
things?

502
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,019
Yeah, I mean they just look like little monster things.

503
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,630
This one's cool.

504
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,799
This one's too cool for me though.

505
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,700
I kind of like them.

506
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,299
I missed this bakasura like I told you last night.

507
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,799
Who's the burger?

508
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,130
Well, then play the OG bakasura, bro.

509
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:32,829
I know.

510
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,640
Is the burger good?

511
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,940
Yeah, he's pretty good.

512
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,140
He's like kind of easy.

513
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,039
Like when you're solo playing you don't really dial up.

514
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
You're a support though.

515
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,690
I would anyone know that's the character to goddamn burger.

516
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,289
There's skins like that all the time.

517
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:58,769
Reminds me of the old was it the old TF2 thing they used to

518
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,970
say if we want to make sure we keep the silhouettes the same.

519
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,369
We want to make sure you can tell who it is from across the

520
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:04,970
whole map.

521
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,569
I don't want to join a fucking fan club.

522
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:07,970
Get out.

523
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,470
I just finished watching the germ of it.

524
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,470
I think I'm good on Ares.

525
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,170
You think you're good to go?

526
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,210
Yep, I got this.

527
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,910
I think we're going to win this tournament.

528
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,009
How do you block all notifications from coming up?

529
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,880
IDK.

530
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,180
I don't know because I can't do it.

531
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,920
Apparently is that going to pop up in the games?

532
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,720
Hope not.

533
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,690
No, hope not.

534
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:34,880
If it does you'll find out the the the death toll transcendence

535
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,079
when demon that's all for me.

536
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,079
Yep, you and that's first second third like that's in order

537
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,180
and fully build the item before you start another item.

538
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,420
How do you have the crazy skins?

539
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,519
So if you are in game and you type in like you can search at

540
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:56,640
the top transcendence till it'll all be there.

541
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,140
Can I buy death toll?

542
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,539
There we go.

543
00:20:58,539 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm on D&D.

544
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,839
No, you already have a starter.

545
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,539
You only buy one starter item that I'm going to sell and then

546
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,440
sell and do this, right?

547
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,279
So, okay.

548
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:12,970
This is the other God I would be playing.

549
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,670
Why can't I buy it?

550
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,470
I'm back with them are locked.

551
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,369
Are you in the base?

552
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,970
Yeah, are you clicking on like one of the higher ones like

553
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,470
death's embrace or something instead of no, I'm literally

554
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,369
clicking death's goal.

555
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,369
Should I get this one?

556
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,569
You have the gold you have six with the old.

557
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,970
I have five thousand.

558
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,299
You can't change your starter item.

559
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,799
I sold it because you left the base already.

560
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,299
Yeah, that's why it's because you already left the base.

561
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Are you would buy one?

562
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
That's your item for the game.

563
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,900
Would it be weird if in Miz Kiff's smite tournament?

564
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,799
I played as Miz Kiff and just did all the voice spams and

565
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,599
was like annoying.

566
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,279
Does it really matter as long as you don't think it's weird?

567
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,380
You do you man.

568
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,980
Exactly.

569
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,480
It's from let your means be dreams.

570
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,759
Who's Miz Kiff?

571
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,519
I don't know.

572
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,420
I can I got a random DM.

573
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,119
I just didn't know what to say.

574
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,059
I was like, yeah, I've played smite before.

575
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,359
It's not like I begged him in public to make sure I was able

576
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,160
to play today.

577
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,309
Are you trying to make some money?

578
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,240
Yeah, let me know when I got to leave.

579
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,539
What's the first place team win?

580
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,839
I think this is very important.

581
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
Okay, each 12k each person.

582
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,140

Yeah, 70k for first place.

584
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,380
Wow.

585
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
So how do we win?

586
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,880
If you if you buckle up and don't be a problem.

587
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
All right, that sounds good then.

588
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,799
Yeah, we wanted the best side of you, man.

589
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,130
No, I am going to be the best.

590
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,730
That's the thing.

591
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,329
Like I genuinely believe I am the best.

592
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:52,329
Okay, we're fucked.

593
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,730
Oh, this monster has a nice butt.

594
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,730

No, you want to see what I'm talking about?

600
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,730

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,940
this game with like a bunch of gods fighting each other

720
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,240
and like a bakasura and I feel like this is you kind of a guy

721
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,940
can I unlock the Queen of cards?

722
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,700
Um, you it's all I don't know how many gems they give you

723
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,700
but you gave me 8,000 or is 10,000 really that should be

724
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,400
enough if it's available if you go back to buy all yeah,

725
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,500
if you click on the skin, it should say like this much to

726
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,799
buy everything and you have to buy everything.

727
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,700
Oh what no, it's 9,240.

728
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't have enough.

729
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:05,500
Okay.

730
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,299
I sounds like you need to swipe boy.

731
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,900
I literally am going to minimize my chat at when once

732
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,599
the game starts because I know I'm going to look over there

733
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,700
because I'm going to miss something.

734
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,799
I'm going to miss like I'm going to miss click on something

735
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,299
and I'm going to see a bunch of Omega wells and it's going

736
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:17,700
to fuck with me.

737
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,900
So I can not gonna look but you get affected that much by

738
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,299
a little bit of Omega lulz.

739
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,500
Oh, yeah, of course I do.

740
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,799
I look over if I have something goes wrong and I see Omega

741
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,400
low like he sucks so bad.

742
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,299
I get affects me.

743
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:28,900
I can't look at it.

744
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,200
Okay.

745
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,000
What if they all start saying poggers?

746
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
He did it instead.

747
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,599
Then I get way too overconfident.

748
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,599
Then you're yeah, exactly.

749
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,900
You're like, oh fuck.

750
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,599
I did a good play.

751
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,599
I got to do something else.

752
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,599
I don't know what I'm going to do and then chat stops blogging.

753
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,400
You're like fuck now.

754
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,000
Very affected by the emotes coming at you.

755
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah, of course.

756
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
I can see the Omega lulz in the corner of my eye without even

757
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,200
looking at it.

758
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:51,200
Yeah, that's what I mean.

759
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,599
What if you saw them spamming?

760
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh my God.

761
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
It's lacari chasing you through the boreal winter.

762
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,900
Please run and find cover.

763
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,099
He has bad intentions.

764
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,369
I would have no idea what the fuck that meant.

765
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,180
They did me dirty, bro.

766
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,839
I have that emote just shortened.

767
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,640
He chasing.

768
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,940
Yeah, that's too much to type.

769
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,849
Wait, that's an emote.

770
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,650
Yeah, you want to see it.

771
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,549
You can have an emote.

772
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:26,750
That's that long.

773
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,289
Well, it's like a third part.

774
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,390
Oh, that's insane.

775
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,990
I think my smite crashed.

776
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,289
Oh, oh wait.

777
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:42,829
So draft that means we are they mirrors in a draft?

778
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,170
Any any devs are watching?

779
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,670
I would like a thousand more gems, please.

780
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,819
They typed it out.

781
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:51,519
Let me read this real quick.

782
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,420
No, there's no bands.

783
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,720
You're doing draft just because it's an order pick.

784
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,819
Okay, but so but they can still be a mirror in a draft.

785
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,769
Think so.

786
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,920
Yeah, no, there shouldn't be no mirror picks.

787
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,819
That's why the like the orders actually matters.

788
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,220
And when you pick it matters, they can take your shit

789
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,019
or you can take theirs.

790
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,539
Okay, I got it.

791
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,640
I don't think they will.

792
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,839
I think I know what they're going to play.

793
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,190
Yeah, they probably know everything we're doing, dude.

794
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:30,789
What are they doing?

795
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,990
Dude.

796
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,490
Oh my God.

797
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,190
I got an idea.

798
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,890
What if we do what if we do five Winston's and just fucking

799
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,490
run that the by the point we five Winston's we just all jump

800
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,990
and we all go to like mid tower.

801
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,140
That'd be poggers.

802
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,109
I know they actually can't I don't think so.

803
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:50,829
Wait, there's a character called Winston.

804
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,569
No people did not like that one.

805
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,230
I looked it up.

806
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,829
Why would they not like that?

807
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:02,329
I don't know.

808
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,660
Where's Miz Kiff?

809
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,559
I want a personal hello and I want a personal in every team

810
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,660
voice chat him coming in and introducing the event.

811
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:23,460
Where is he?

812
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,160
Then he would be introducing it right now.

813
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Actually, he's casting it.

814
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,259
Oh, I thought he was a player.

815
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,059
I did too.

816
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,059
He was supposed to play and he's supposed to coach or cast

817
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,160
and then he wasn't going to do anything.

818
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,359
And then I don't know what happened.

819
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,180
So there's no bands.

820
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,380
Are you able to just be in the call with us the whole time?

821
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,079
It's the good thing.

822
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,579
You can't be in the call the entire time.

823
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,779
Yes, this is going to be interesting.

824
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,279
Well, there are no picks.

825
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,279
There's no bands.

826
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,380
There's orders like the like what order you should pick shit.

827
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,579
I bought the bundle.

828
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,980
And I can kind of run you through what they're going to be

829
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,180
doing with their pigs.

830
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,880
So if you guys want to weaken your streaming, right?

831
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,680
Yep.

832
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,880
So if you guys want to watch somebody kind of put the hands

833
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,180
in their head and like kind of look down for how long the

834
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,779
tournament is because that you're going to be like screaming

835
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,880
at us to do something like just you're going to be like,

836
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,779
oh my God, please go that way and we can't hear you.

837
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,779
So we can you want to go watch the disappointment.

838
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,180
It'll be on weekends.

839
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,880
I thought you were I thought you were here holding our hand

840
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,279
the entire time and I thought that's what it was going to be

841
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:26,880
a first to you.

842
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,779
Oh my God.

843
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
This is a whole different like ball game.

844
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,079
I feel like I'm playing a different game right now.

845
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,380
So now you're scared.

846
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,480
No, I'm not scared.

847
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,079
Of course not.

848
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,079
I still do I have time to get the tea.

849
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,079
No, you have no time to do anything.

850
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,779
You have to sit here now.

851
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,680
Who's drinking tea here me?

852
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,930
You a tea guy?

853
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,730
Yeah, I do like tea.

854
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,829
But what type of tea are you drinking matcha?

855
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Wait matcha tea is good.

856
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,660
I actually I actually like matcha tea.

857
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:00,859
All right.

858
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:01,359
There you go.

859
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,059
Yeah.

860
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:02,460
All right.

861
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
I like green tea.

862
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,339
I like I don't like Jasmine tea though.

863
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:11,140
It's a little too much.

864
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,440
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Jasmine but green teas.

865
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,140
All right.

866
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,039
When I was younger, I used to like a lot of green tea.

867
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,140
Why are we in queue for seven minutes?

868
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,740
It just says that because they're still like announcing teams and shit.

869
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,440
Okay.

870
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,140
Yeah.

871
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,039
So don't be nervous poke like chill bitch.

872
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,440
Damn it is like perfume.

873
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:33,440
It is like perfume freaking out.

874
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,740
Okay, we're going to get Mendo team.

875
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,039
Leans back with you.

876
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,839
Yep.

877
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,039
Oh no, every time every time I drink green green tea with Jasmine.

878
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,539
I just feel like I'm walking through the perfume section of a Macy's.

879
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,309
I like getting black tea in my boba.

880
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,759
That's good.

881
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,130
Oh, I bought the juicy is a Nami scan.

882
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,930
I'm going fucking deep a 9200 green gems later.

883
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,730
So you swiped?

884
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,930
No, I didn't swipe.

885
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,630
I had some extra epic coins.

886
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,030
So I only had to put nine dollars.

887
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,269
Yeah, dude, they gave me they gave me some some nom noms epic coins

888
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,269
or volt whatever the fuck you want to go in the epic.

889
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,280
Wait, so are we all playing at the same time or is it one team at a time?

890
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:26,579
I mean two teams at a time.

891
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,780
I'm pretty sure it's round robin.

892
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,179
So you all have to be like there's no way you aren't playing at the same time.

893
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,880
Okay, so are they on the main broadcast?

894
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,780
Are they just going to be jumping around or are they just picking a game in each round?

895
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,679
Guess is they're going to pick a game but they're they're like production.

896
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,380
Dude is from higher from smite.

897
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,880
So I don't know.

898
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,679
He might be a little bit into it.

899
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,179
Oh my god.

900
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,489
Oh my glob.

901
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,030
Why can't we just do like a rock-paper-scissors?

902
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,530
They do these queues 10 minute queue high res.

903
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,269
What the fuck is this 10 minute queue?

904
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,070
Hey, the queue times are completely fine.

905
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,170
And this game is pop.

906
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,469
Wait, what single limb?

907
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:14,769
That's what my dad say.

908
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:15,670
So it's not best of three.

909
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,570
It's like wait, we're going to get knocked out right now potentially.

910
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,969
No, you're going to win.

911
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,869
Wait, I thought we were playing everybody once.

912
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,469
No, German.

913
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:25,570
We're going to knock out the other team right now being trolled.

914
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,969
You have to be getting trolled.

915
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:27,869
There's no way.

916
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,769
Yeah, if you like it's group stages.

917
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,070
So it has to be where you have to everybody.

918
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,369
Well, if you don't it's just dumb.

919
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:34,670
Yeah, it would make no sense.

920
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,869
I think what they mean by single limb round Robin is you face everyone

921
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:45,670
on your group once top to go bottom to leave type thing and losers

922
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,269
bracket if this is going to be a long tournament then, huh?

923
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,269
As long as the strap in.

924
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,519
All right.

925
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,019
I got a pee because I you can't play a tournament with a

926
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,820
I have to there's no way I would be actually wait if you don't

927
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
pee though playing under pressure actually makes you play better

928
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,420
sometimes I actually made a video about that belt and then come

929
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,719
back.

930
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:08,820
Yeah.

931
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,320
So what was your your hypothesis?

932
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,619
Well, my here's my hypothesis inclusion.

933
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,019
I'm drinking a bunch of tea.

934
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,219
So right now I have to pee now and I'm drinking a bunch of tea

935
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,119
or now I have a pee right now.

936
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,719
Do you know that if you have to pee all more often and you pee

937
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,119
like really fast like you know, I know but but but listen listen

938
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,519
to me.

939
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,519
I'm the captain you listen to the captain.

940
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,019
Yes, sir.

941
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:32,320
Yes, sir.

942
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,719
Yes, sir.

943
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,019
If you drink, okay, if you drink too much if you have to pee

944
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:39,420
and you keep drinking water and shit, then I'm trying to get

945
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,019
in front of the pee.

946
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,820
That's going to have to happen in an hour when we're in the

947
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,320
game and I can't leave you soon.

948
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,920
But if you keep holding it in your balls are going to explode

949
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,420
because pee is sort of the balls.

950
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:48,420
All right.

951
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,219
I'll be right back.

952
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:49,820
I'll be right back.

953
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,420
You already pissing with you.

954
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,920
I will pin.

955
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:55,139
Okay, I'm pissing there.

956
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,449
I'll be back now.

957
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,449
Just leave the chat open.

958
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:04,809
Whatever vacation beads and agus annual do I have to buy

959
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,309
those or set those they're free.

960
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:09,210
So when you start you get one of them level one and then

961
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,210
level 12 you get the other one.

962
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,809
Which one do I get first the purification beads get them

963
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:14,610
in the exact order not going to lie.

964
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,809
That sounds dirty just beads to get out of my purification

965
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:20,110
beads.

966
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,309
Do they do they really think this through when they made

967
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,210
that I'm not really a beads guy.

968
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,510
I'm more of a plug kind of guy.

969
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,110
Oh, okay.

970
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,809
Yeah, maybe they should rename it to purification plug.

971
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:30,710
Yeah, 100% better.

972
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,460
Oh, hi res.

973
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,780
Hello.

974
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,800
Hello.

975
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,179
They're very quiet real pissing.

976
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,980
Yeah, everyone penis just peeing.

977
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,320
Wait, what the fuck is that slipknot skins available?

978
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:11,539
Yeah, you know my cousins and sublet slipknot be trolling.

979
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,139
Yeah, no, he's actually one of the main singers.

980
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,239
I don't believe that.

981
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,039
I don't believe it either.

982
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,039
His name is James.

983
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:19,670
Oh wait.

984
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,070
No, that actually does make sense.

985
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,139
Wait.

986
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,440
No, that actually is his cousin.

987
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,739
Yeah, he's an asshole though.

988
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:31,139
He doesn't give us never give the family money at all.

989
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:32,670
It's fucked up.

990
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:35,719
All my homies.

991
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,400
Hey James, and we all listen to eat.

992
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,699
Now.

993
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,599
What do you guys listen to?

994
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,969
I can't listen to anything.

995
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,369
I got a double all my phone.

996
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:46,670
You don't be doing it yet.

997
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,639
Yeah, true Russell.

998
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,539
When you got any song man, your last song.

00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,940
Come on, man, dude.

1000
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,139
Listen, I'm not even kidding.

1001
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,340
I want to get back in the booth.

1002
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,739
Okay, I need to prove myself.

1003
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:58,840
You know, I got something to prove.

1004
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,739
I'm like a little baby.

1005
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,000
Let's go.

1006
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,900
Let's go do this week.

00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,500
Do you guys do play three games?

1008
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,539
By the way, what three you have three matches.

1009

You're gonna we're playing back to back to back against them.

00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,940
No, no, no once against this team and then Amiros team and

00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,960
finals or some shit and her has awesome skins.

1014
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,019
Fuck looks like you need to swipe a little bit more.

1015
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:32,389
Yeah, no, but I can't get the skins said.

1016
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,690
Yeah, what the fuck is my oh got it.

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,349
You can't you can't get the fucking funny over there, man.

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,750
Yeah, it's hilarious.

1019
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,880
Anything you want to share with class?

1020
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,679
I don't know why I laughed with my mic open.

1021
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,079
That is actually really rude of me guys.

1022
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,760
Yeah, and now you have to explain I went into Amarus chat

1023
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,539
and I said she sucks and that she's gonna lose and she

1024
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,039
insulted me and I thought it was funny.

1025
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,980
How did she insult you?

1026
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,320
She said what the fuck Russell you did not open up a spine

1027
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
until this morning, which that is not true.

1028
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I don't know why she said that is true actually all week

1029
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,019
literally what she said is true.

1030
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,019
So I have more hours than you sure for I'm literally a higher

1031
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:21,280
level than you in this game somebody's being toxic.

1032
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,780
I have more real life than you children.

1033
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,980
Wait, so who's being toxic swallow it on my own terms.

1034
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,019
Somebody told me to calm down who's being toxic.

1035
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:32,420
I'm the time the team captain.

1036
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,420
I need to know who my team needs to start providing some

1037
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,320
order here.

1038
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,320
What are you doing fighting who you're not even listening

1039
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,719
for and Russell.

1040
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,320
Okay.

1041
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,019
All right guys.

1042
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,619
I didn't tell you I think I'm the best Aries that has ever

1043
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,619
stepped foot in this game.

1044
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,389
Why is that?

1045
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,800
I just like I played today and I'm like, holy hell.

1046
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm so self dude.

1047
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,099
Whoever says let's I'm the captain mates up.

1048
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,039
It's not captain at all.

1049
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:03,739
What's that from?

1050
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:04,239
What's that from?

1051
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:04,840
What's that from?

1052
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,909
It's from the Caribbean.

1053
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:09,510
No, I'll do it again.

1054
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,309
I'll do it one more time.

1055
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:11,210
I got a job.

1056
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:12,610
I got a job.

1057
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,719
Yeah, that's not incorrect.

1058
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,829
I don't know the most famous line.

1059
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:23,829
No, I'll do it again.

1060
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:24,670
Do the line.

1061
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,170
Do the line.

1062
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:25,869
Do the line.

1063
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,769
Whoever says that they are the captain is no captain at all.

1064
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,820
Why does that sound like fucking?

1065
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,420
Oh, that's that's the burning on Connery.

1066
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,920
Why does it sound like burning crusade?

1067
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,719
That's correct.

1068
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:46,300
King Anduin win says it to thrall.

1069
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,000
Guys, we're in.

1070
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,000

1161
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:06,559
Will it just lock it in closing 10 seconds?

1162
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:07,960
It'll close the whole lobby in 10 seconds.

1163
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,260

00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:53,860
I'm on the wrong side.

1250
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,760
Wait, didn't I start?

1251
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,829
It's in here now, huh?

1252
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,630
You guys have to do the blue thing into the purple thing together.

1253
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:03,429
Yes.

1254
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,030
Where are you at?

1255
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,929
Start at the blue thing and then move to the purple thing.

1256
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:06,929
You both going to take that.

1257
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:08,130
Yep.

1258
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:08,530
I'm coming.

1259
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,329
Which one's blue?

1260
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,429
The one you're right beside right now.

1261
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,230
All right, you guys ready?

1262
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,530
Three two one action.

1263
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,730
Camp right here.

1264
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,530
I take this.

1265
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,039
I have colorblind mode or something.

1266
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,139
This is actually green.

1267
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:23,539
I don't know.

1268
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah, I'm going to try as hard as I fucking can.

1269
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,139
I think you were supposed to take that.

1270
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,739
I said that.

1271
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,539
What did you take?

1272
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,639
Russell doesn't deserve it.

1273
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,239
Okay.

1274
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:35,840
Now you try.

1275
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,739
Let's fuck shit up.

1276
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,440
I guess you can take this.

1277
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,639
By the way, I only picked this character because he pukes.

1278
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,570
Oh my bad Russell.

1279
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,469
That was I'm colorblind as well.

1280
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:46,570
So I guess I have to take it.

1281
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:47,670
Bro, it's fine.

1282
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,070
It's brought to the previous leg.

1283
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,670
Wait, they're walking up to us.

1284
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:50,969
Help.

1285
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,269
Help.

1286
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:51,769
We died.

1287
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:52,670
Good luck.

1288
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,170
Oh shoot them, bro.

1289
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,969
Junglers going left side.

1290
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,469
Yeah, Junglers going left.

1291
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,269
Listen, I just farm and we win the game.

1292
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,170
Yep, true.

1293
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,369
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you guys ready?

1294
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:02,769

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:04,860
Let's go.

1297
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,260
Let's go.

1298
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,460
Let's go some early bullshit.

1299
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,159
I'm coming in early gang.

1300
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:08,760
Let's go for it.

1301
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,460
Wait, they have minions.

1302
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,159
They have minions.

1303
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,159
A lot of minutes don't matter.

1304
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:11,860
Don't matter.

1305
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,159
Why doesn't?

1306
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,059
Okay, I'm here.

1307
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:14,860
Oh, no, they know.

1308
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,159
They know.

1309
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:15,360
They know.

1310
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,059
They know pushing you.

1311
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:16,360
They know.

1312
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,760
They know.

1313
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,559
No, they know.

1314
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:17,860
I'm dying.

1315
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,559
Taking so much champion damage.

1316
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,260
Minion damage.

1317
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:20,760
Shit.

1318
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,260
What?

1319
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,460
Champagne damage?

1320
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,360
You got a Bologna.

1321
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,260
She's doing the totem.

1322
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,059
I don't like that.

1323
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,429
Guys, we're doing fantastic right now.

1324
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:30,829

Jebaited.

1327
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:32,730
I got Jebaited.

1328
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,530
Junglers on my side.

1329
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:34,829
They switched lanes.

1330
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:35,630
Hey guys, we're okay.

1331
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,429
We warmed up now.

1332
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,030
Yep.

1333
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,329
Yep.

1334
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:37,630
Yep.

1335
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:39,320
All right.

1336
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,119
How's it has mid look?

1337
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:43,719
I mean, we're just say, you know, a push war.

1338
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,219
All right.

1339
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:44,719
Watch this ready.

1340
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm watching.

1341
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,599
Wait, if I'm in the tower ring, do I get less gold?

1342
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,699
What was I watching?

1343
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,199
No.

1344
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,300
Do you want these mid camps?

1345
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,199
Holden powers, right?

1346
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,000
Maybe.

1347
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,599
They're taking it.

1348
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:57,800
We got it.

1349
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,599
We got to stop them.

1350
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,400
Yes, sir.

1351
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:01,500
Really?

1352
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,699
You let the burger take it.

1353
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,800
You're scared of a burger.

1354
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,300
You damage them.

1355
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,900
You damage.

1356
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,219
Okay, you be the burger.

1357
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:11,320
How's solo doing right now?

1358
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,619
Did they take did they take all my camps?

1359
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:14,719
Probably.

1360
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,119
What the fuck?

1361
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,519
They're pushing us.

1362
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:19,119
Probably did.

1363
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:21,619
Block it for you.

1364
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:22,019
Block it for you.

1365
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:22,619
I'm blocking for you.

1366
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,519
I am dead.

1367
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:25,519
Muscle.

1368
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,320
Man, I tried to save you.

1369
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,920
They went on when they went in on you and I tried to save you.

1370
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:33,619
It's okay.

1371
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:34,820
That's okay that we die though.

1372
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,320
That's okay.

1373
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:35,619
Yeah.

1374
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,300
We can't lose a slick and want to know what's my beads do again.

1375
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,099
It makes it so you can get out of any CC.

1376
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:46,099
Got it.

1377
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
What's my G do?

1378
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:50,099
You don't have one yet.

1379
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:50,599
That's it.

1380
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:51,599
That's your second relic.

1381
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:52,300
You get that later.

1382
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,800
Oh, it looks like something's in my slot.

1383
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,900
Yeah, it's like a little a little gem looking thing.

1384
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,050
That's not real.

1385
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,610
I'm going to get red for you.

1386
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:05,639
It's any help on my side.

1387
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,639
I'm mixing right side missing right side missing right side.

1388
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:16,280
All right, I'll come left and after I get this block across over

1389
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,780
mid house has mid look.

1390
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,980
I'm just pushing him to tower constantly.

1391
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,880
He's doing that.

1392
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
I can't like get through it.

1393
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,179
All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna come.

1394
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:25,980
I'm gonna come left side.

1395
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,480
We don't rent the windows anymore.

1396
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Just saying at all.

1397
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,780
Why because like I mean that we're just both underleveled.

1398
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:35,420
You said the balloon is really aggressive.

1399
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:36,820
Yeah, really guys.

1400
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,420
All right.

1401
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:38,019
I'm coming.

1402
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,460
Yeah, I don't think they know.

1403
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,460
I think they're the team might think that I don't know the other

1404
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,960
map like other side of the map exists.

1405
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,159
I think we'll be all right coming to you guys poke.

1406
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,159
I push him out a little getting going here.

1407
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,059
They might have words.

1408
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,019
Are they getting six gold?

1409
00:51:58,019 --> 00:51:59,019
Is it because I'm too close?

1410
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,019
Yeah, back up back up.

1411
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
There they can't.

1412
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,900
Oh, yeah, they're at camp near to kill him.

1413
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,400
Let's go.

1414
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,099
Yeah, let's do it.

1415
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:06,599
Let's do it.

1416
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:10,170
I'm sorry.

1417
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,269
Hey, hey, you got a money.

1418
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:12,769
You can't go in earlier.

1419
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:13,869
Yeah, sorry.

1420
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:14,070
Sorry.

1421

Next time.

1422
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,070
I was good.

1423
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:16,769
Oh my fucking god.

1424
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:19,170
This balloon is got fucking baloney sandwich.

1425
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,170
I'm dead.

1426
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,909
Oh, he's pushing us.

1427
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:25,610
He's pushing us.

1428
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,210
I wasn't supposed to.

1429
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:26,809
How was it?

1430
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:27,909
What's happening to me?

1431
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,809
What's happening to me?

1432
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:33,920
I just got dunked on around right now.

1433
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,489
We just got ganked.

1434
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:40,409
Why did I just get thrown across them?

1435
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:44,980
I'm going right.

1436
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,260
No, I'm going left.

1437
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,440
I like as all right, just farm.

1438
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,139
Just farm farm farm.

1439
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:52,639
We'll be good.

1440
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:53,239
It's all right.

1441
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,940
We only have four.

1442
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:54,340
We're good.

1443
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,039
I made a carry.

1444
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,559
Do they have 80 carry?

1445
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:01,699
Yeah, they free.

1446
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:03,469
I'm so underleveled.

1447
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:04,469
I got a farm so bad.

1448
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:05,769
Yeah, well, I'm stronger.

1449
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,139
And I'm older.

1450
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,829
No, what the fuck is this thing?

1451
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:15,869
Kill minions.

1452
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,199
I'm dying.

1453
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,199
My balloon is gone.

1454
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,900
Yeah, I'm missing missing left.

1455
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,500
Yo, I'm dying to this.

1456
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,800
My balloon is basing.

1457
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,699
I'm pushing tower.

1458
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,500
Yeah, I would just push tower.

1459
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:29,929
I have no gold.

1460
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:31,030
I think we're on tower all game.

1461
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,829
Maybe let's just clear these minions quick then.

1462
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:39,139
Oh, she TP?

1463
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:40,539
You want to get on mid camps?

1464
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:43,159
Yes.

1465
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,059
They're not there anymore.

1466
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:44,460
Never mind.

1467
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,760
Let's go get the red thing.

1468
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,360
Purple thing.

1469
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:47,059
Yeah.

1470
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,760
I was going to try to help you gank, but it doesn't matter.

1471
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:50,659
It's not up.

1472
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,460
Red buff will be there when you get back.

1473
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,590
We should get the side thing.

1474
00:53:58,690 --> 00:53:59,190
She's going to help.

1475
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,090
She's going to do fire totem.

1476
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:00,690
We want to help.

1477
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:04,809
All right.

1478
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,409
I have ult.

1479
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,079
How you guys doing all right?

1480
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:08,980
We're going to kill mid.

1481
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,079
Yeah, let's try to get it.

1482
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,260
Poseidon will start.

1483
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,639
I mean, let me get, let me get, let me get more kills.

1484
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:18,739
I got, I have to level up.

1485
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:20,039
Yeah, they're outleveling us.

1486
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:21,739
Poseidon is missing.

1487
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,340
Or mid's missing, rather.

1488
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:28,210
They're getting the side camp, just saying.

1489
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,360
I'm just so desperate for XP right now.

1490
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,579
Are those traps?

1491
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:40,670
Oh, yeah.

1492
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,170
I can see if we can gank someone or not.

1493
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:43,670
Yeah.

1494
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,670
Let's, are they, how far up are they in right side?

1495
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,269
Sorry, my bad.

1496
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,119
Are they, are they in lane?

1497
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:49,619
Oh, here we go.

1498
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,019
Wait, our teammates gone.

1499
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:52,019
Our team, our team's gone.

1500
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,320
Focus the Freya, if we can.

1501
00:54:56,619 --> 00:54:56,920
Yeah.

1502
00:54:58,059 --> 00:54:58,960
Wait, I can, I can push.

1503
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,460
I can push.

1504
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,260
I'm here.

1505
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,059
Let's go.

1506
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,659
Pick up, pick up.

1507
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:04,260
Pull, pull, pull.

1508
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:07,900
There it is.

1509
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,199
There it is.

1510
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:08,500
All right.

1511
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:08,900
Bring it back.

1512
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,300
Bring it back.

1513
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,199
Bring, we can, we can bring it back.

1514
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:10,400
We're good.

1515
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,699
We're good.

1516
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:11,500
Good, good, good, good, good.

1517
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,300
Oh, beautiful.

1518
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,070
One tower, one tower here.

1519
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:16,869
Back up, back to farm, back to farm.

1520
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:18,769
Don't hit, don't hit him under tower.

1521
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:20,480
He's dead.

1522
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,880
He's dead.

1523
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,079
We know, but you're dead.

1524
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,340
The what?

1525
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:25,539
Oh, my health.

1526
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:26,039
Oh, my God.

1527
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:26,840
I gotta wait.

1528
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:28,039
Oh, my God.

1529
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:28,340
Yeah.

1530
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:28,639
Be careful.

1531
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:28,940
Careful.

1532
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,079
They're taking my tower.

1533
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:31,380
No, no, no.

1534
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:31,679
We're good.

1535
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:31,980
We're good.

1536
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,960
You should back poke and try to bug.

1537
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,360
Yeah, I'm out.

1538
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:34,860
I'm out.

1539
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:37,280
All right.

1540
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:37,579
Here we go.

1541
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:37,880
Come back, dude.

1542
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,380
Easy clap.

1543
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,079
Who's their mid?

1544
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:43,309
The void camp's back up.

1545
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,409
I got an item.

1546
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,710
No, I don't want that fucking thing.

1547
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:47,579
Oh, it's siren.

1548
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,780
Oh, I thought I finished it.

1549
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,280
Oh, I hear music.

1550
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,280
No, that's not good.

1551
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:53,920
What do I buy?

1552
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,480
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get blue for you.

1553
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,179
Is it is it new me?

1554
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,280
I don't want to drop it.

1555
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:01,579
Don't open mine.

1556
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,780
Why?

1557
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,280
What does your ulti do?

1558
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:05,760
Russell?

1559
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,230
What does your ulti do?

1560
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,130
I don't know.

1561
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,079
I don't know.

1562
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:12,880
I don't know.

1563
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:14,780
That pole was huge, by the way.

1564
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,780
That's how we got that killed.

1565
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,909
He give you a build in the chat.

1566
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,409
You look at all right.

1567
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:23,610
So you you want to?

1568
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,010
They're taking all our shit.

1569
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:28,909
Okay, okay, okay.

1570
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:30,010
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1571
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:31,610
Let's get you this buff.

1572
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,110
You want protections, right?

1573
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,309
You want like who's doing all the damage on their team right now?

1574
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,170
The dodgy physical, right?

1575
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:42,769
Belona hurts.

1576
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,170
Yeah, I've got physical damage.

1577
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,170
Okay, for one poke.

1578
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,869
You're not even under tower, bro.

1579
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:50,969
You died because you were fucking dumb in our buff.

1580
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:52,670
You're a reading fucking items.

1581
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:52,969
Sorry.

1582
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:54,369
Hey, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, we're in this.

1583
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:54,769
We're in this.

We're good.

1585
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:55,269
We're good.

1586
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:55,570
We're good.

1587

We're everything's okay.

1590

I can't push up guys.

1591
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,239
We're doing great.

1592
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,739
I got buffs up.

1593
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,070
Hey, it's only 2v5.

1594
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,070
We're good.

1595
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:10,800
I'm afk.

1596
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,300
Who's afk?

1597
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,400
They're on the right side of them on the right side buff.

1598
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,000
Just saying.

1599

Are they over?

1600
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,949
Yeah, they're here.

1601
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:24,909
I'm getting out jungled.

1602
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,409

Okay, they have jungler is like the best jungler in like the

Well, he did start.

1606
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:36,730
I'm hurting this.

1607
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:37,530
I'm going to come.

1608
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,630
I'm going to come over there.

1609
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,329
I'm coming to gank the balloon.

1610
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,130
Yeah, let's let's collapse on left there.

1611
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,829
She's too strong.

1612
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:45,030
Honestly, just go somewhere else.

1613
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,829
I can't even hurt her.

1614
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,329
What if we we I mean, what if we we could collapse on her?

1615
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:54,130
I say let's let's let's just fucking go nuts.

1616
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:54,730
You know what I mean?

1617
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,800
They're all here.

1618
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,400
They're here here here here.

1619
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:04,230
What's the point of jumping?

1620
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,630
Watch out.

1621
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:05,530
What do you mean?

1622
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:06,329
What's the point of jumping?

1623
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:09,550
We could do the fire thing.

1624
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:10,949
Oh, the dodgy writer.

1625
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,349
We cannot do the fire giant.

1626
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,650
Oh my god is bad.

1627
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:17,949
I do.

1628
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,070
Oh my god.

1629
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,369
I'm dead.

1630
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:20,969
Fuck.

1631
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:21,969
Oh, I don't know.

1632
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:22,869
I was thinking fuck.

1633
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,670
I got I saw red my brain.

1634
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,170
I forgot the dodgy was so how overleveled I forgot fuck.

1635
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,219
All right.

1636
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:35,519
We're okay.

1637
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:35,920
We're okay.

1638
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:38,789
I have question mark to him.

1639
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:45,550
I got to level up.

1640
00:58:46,849 --> 00:58:48,750
We can't we can't why?

1641
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,050
Oh, yeah.

1642
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:49,349
Okay.

1643
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:49,849
I'm now dead.

1644
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:52,800
Are we here?

1645
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,500
No, we're not.

1646
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,400
Yeah, I'm coming over there for the brand.

1647
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,099
Maybe as we need help with the we need help.

1648
00:58:58,099 --> 00:58:58,400
We need help.

1649
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:58,800
We need help.

1650
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:03,909
Okay, then we're okay.

1651
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:04,909
No, you're good.

1652
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:05,210
Go on.

1653
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,010
I'm I'm here.

1654
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:06,210
Okay.

1655
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,510
No, okay.

1656
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,010
No money.

1657
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,010
I have a lot of money.

1658
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,599
That's what it said.

1659
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:20,170
How's it buff over here?

1660
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,159
Look, okay.

1661
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:22,659
Grab this.

1662
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,860
We've got all these items.

1663
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,570
Oh, I'm dead.

1664
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:30,570
Oh shit.

1665
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,769
See if I can help.

1666
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:33,469
Oh, you're in trouble.

1667
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,949
I was on my own Russell.

1668
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:38,050
I love you, but you gotta be more in front of me.

1669
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,699
What I wasn't even near you.

1670
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:42,199
I don't think in Lane next game.

1671
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:42,599
Watch out.

1672
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:43,699
Hey, they're going in here.

1673
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:44,699
Yeah, whip it out.

1674
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:49,940
Careful.

1675
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,039
Careful in this jungle over here.

1676
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,840
They're all collapsed in mid side.

1677
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,719
Can we get a pick off?

1678
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:00,519
They're doing the really right side.

1679
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:01,119
Super right side.

1680
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,119
It's three minutes.

1681
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:03,219
That's three minutes right now.

1682
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:06,559
I gotta go farm.

1683
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,360
Oh, maybe I might be able to help you here.

1684
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:11,559
I should have got my fucking all.

1685
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,539
All right, poke.

1686
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,139
I'm with you.

1687
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:15,239
I have no.

1688
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,739
Oh, that one's guys one.

1689
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:19,480
Really fuck.

1690
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,280
Come on, man.

1691
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,150
You got that person though, right?

1692
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,250
I'm taking power taking power.

1693
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:28,699
No fuck.

1694
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:30,900
How I could they just got away.

1695
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,599
Fuck.

1696
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,699
I have no idea what that one person's.

1697
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,900
How did I not kill that one person?

1698
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:38,300
What?

1699
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,099
Fuck the all four of them were in there.

1700
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,099
Okay, we took it.

1701
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,400
We got we got left our.

1702
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,000
All right, good.

1703
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:50,869
Wait, he's getting XP camp.

1704
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:52,869
Maybe we should get okay.

1705
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:53,969
Let's get XP camp.

1706
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,579
It's dead.

1707
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:56,179
Yeah, they got it.

1708
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,780
Shit.

1709
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,480
We are our lanes missing our lanes missing.

1710
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,219
Waiting for an item.

1711
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,519
I just can't believe I didn't kill.

1712
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:03,420
They hit like two ticks.

1713
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,719
Wait, there's a maximum kill this guy.

1714
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:05,420
You want to kill this guy?

1715
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,519
Yeah, go on.

1716
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,199
I should have cleaned that up.

1717
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,500
I just want I can't hurt them.

1718
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:15,559
I'm just so underleveled.

1719
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:18,659
Fuck if you yeah, if you want to wake up, I'm I'm like,

1720
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,360
I can I can farm pretty hard.

1721
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,559
The fuck just happened.

1722
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,559
Oh, yeah, we can.

1723
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,760
We cannot be dying like that.

1724
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:34,099
I'm getting pretty strong.

1725
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah, we wait.

1726
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,699
This is not over.

1727
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,099
Just saying.

1728
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,519
Yeah, Fred does a lot of damage.

1729
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:40,719
Now.

1730
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:41,219
She's right here.

1731
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:41,719
Be careful.

1732
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:44,480
We actually might be able to get it.

1733
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,230
That means that two or three people are probably right here.

1734
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:49,630
So are they looking at?

1735
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,630
No, they're not looking over there.

1736
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:52,110
My money's low.

1737
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:52,610
Let's get this.

1738
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,260
Right.

1739
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,039
Oh, they're going to try to steal it.

1740
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:56,440
Aren't they?

1741
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,659
Oh my God.

1742
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,260
No way that ain't happening.

1743
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,860
There are thieves.

1744
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,659
Thieves is big.

1745
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:07,159
I got the.

1746
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:08,260
Oh, what the fuck?

1747
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,059
Yeah, we got to back up.

1748
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:09,659
We got to back up.

1749
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,159
I have no idea what this person's alt does.

1750
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:16,250
I thought it would already went past whatever the fuck it does

1751
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,449
and then it would win again.

1752
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:18,150
Poke.

1753
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,050
Don't die, please.

1754
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,449
I'm in lane and fine.

1755
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:22,650
It's faster.

1756
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,150
I just do this.

1757
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,050
Our towers destroyed.

1758
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,409
Which one?

1759
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,610
Right side.

1760
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,519
Oh, they kill it.

1761
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,619
Yeah, we we got to get some of these.

1762
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,820
Objectives, I think.

1763
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:38,820
Okay.

1764
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,920
Although we don't think it's just far behind.

1765
01:02:41,619 --> 01:02:45,119
If we can get to like level 15 to 20 ish.

1766
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,119
I think we'll be okay.

1767
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,219
We just have to get there.

1768
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:48,719
Okay.

1769
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,019
All right.

1770
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,719
Yeah, let's back up.

1771
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,380
Russell.

1772
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,590
I'm here.

1773
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:55,989
I'm here.

1774
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:57,489
Oh my fucking God.

1775
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:01,389
I'm protecting my left hour, but this balona is fucking like.

1776
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:06,179
Dude, what?

1777
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:08,809
Oh, got him.

1778
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,739
They're so overleveled.

1779
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:14,739
I gotta get out of here.

1780
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:15,440
I'm coming.

1781
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:17,739
Yeah, this balona is fucking insane.

1782
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:23,909
All right.

1783
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:24,409
We're good.

1784
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:26,510
We won that we actually won that exchange.

1785
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:26,909
We're good.

1786
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,809
Also, you didn't see him coming.

1787
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:31,059
Did you see him coming?

1788
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,559
Yes, he's between the traps.

1789
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:37,460
I honestly am with this left and might just like you're behind

1790
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,360
me all game.

1791
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,360
I'm pretty strong.

1792
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,659
I could I might be able to like, oh no team.

1793
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:45,360
Arguments supposed to avoid these.

1794
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,860
I think so when you live on your own island until like mid

1795
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,559
end game.

1796
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,960
I don't know how the pacing works differently in Smina.

1797
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,469
Yeah, we're not in bad shape.

1798
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:59,170
We really aren't we can pull this back.

1799
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,230
We're only down like 8k gold gold don't matter.

1800
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,829
It's it's the clutch time is what matters.

1801
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,960
We pick off two or three more people were back.

1802
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:12,159
I'm walking to lane.

1803
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:14,989
Wait, they're pushing.

1804
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:15,690
They're pushing you.

1805
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,789
Oh, I'm getting get to I'm dead.

1806
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,480
I'm dead.

1807
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,980
I'm hooking them in.

1808
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,300
I got to go like new.

1809
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
Collapse collapse collapse.

1810
01:04:38,659 --> 01:04:39,360
Very nice.

1811
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,360
Very nice.

1812
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,559
Just got a god kill.

1813
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:42,260
Just saying.

1814
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:43,960
Good job, man.

1815
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,260
Really pulling it back.

1816
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,159
This is a clutch plays.

1817
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:46,860
Let's go.

1818
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,260
Let's go.

1819
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,659
Wait, look, no, no more arguments.

1820
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:50,659
We're good.

1821
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,389
We're just going to get our hearts and heads in the game.

1822
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:56,590
And we're good to go.

1823
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,789
I need help with this balona.

1824
01:04:57,889 --> 01:04:58,889
I'm coming on my left.

1825
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,300
We might be able to me though.

1826
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,900
Yeah, she's so strong in general.

1827
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,599
She's just tanky.

1828
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,199
She's tanky.

1829
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,300
I can't really touch it.

1830
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,099
She's level 15.

1831
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,500
I was a good hook.

1832
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
You can hook people Russell.

1833
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,000
Yeah, that's this all to me.

1834
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,800
No, no, no, no, no, only my all.

1835
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:13,699
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1836
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,099
So like they're missing up.

1837
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:17,199
Usually I also that they can get sucked under tower and then

1838
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,800
we do all the damage like we zerg them.

1839
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:21,199
Oh shit.

1840
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,179
I mean, I could I could try to fuck around here.

1841
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:27,079
I mean, it's up to you.

1842
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:28,579
Yeah, we should.

1843
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,980
I fucking miss my all.

1844
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,730
I think we're going to wait.

1845
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,230
I'm not with you.

1846
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:34,929
Yeah, I back it up.

1847
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:36,329
Yeah, it's not worth it.

1848
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,630
Buff is almost coming up.

1849
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,630
Yeah, I know.

1850
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:39,130
I see it.

1851
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:41,849
Hi guys doing right here.

1852
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,949
Oh, no, I'm not.

1853
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,650
If you guys gonna yeah, it's missing right now.

1854
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,849
This character careful.

1855
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:50,349
Careful right side.

1856
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:50,949
Careful right side.

1857
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:51,849
I can't move.

1858
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:53,050
I literally can't move.

1859
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:54,849
We should have made.

1860
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:55,750
Yeah, they're all they're all here.

1861
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:56,650
They're all there.

1862
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,349
They're all three three right side.

1863
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:00,030
Okay, we guys.

1864
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,530
Okay.

1865
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:01,630
Now I understand.

1866
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,630
We just got to stop leaving like safe areas.

1867
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,630
Oh, that's fucking huge.

1868
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:07,329
Go in, go in, go in.

1869
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:07,929
That's huge.

1870
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:09,130
Absolutely massive.

1871
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:13,650
Big.

1872
01:06:16,949 --> 01:06:17,250
Get her.

1873
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,050
Collapse, collapse, collapse.

1874
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:18,650
This is huge.

1875
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:20,449
We have surfer ring.

1876
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:20,949
Lose it.

1877
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,849
Therefore, this is actually so hot.

1878
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:24,550
I'm not even kidding.

1879
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,360
I think we forgot.

1880
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:27,360
All right.

1881
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,760
All right.

1882
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,360
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

1883
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:30,760
All this fucking dodgy.

1884
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:32,840
All right.

1885
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,239
That's it.

1886
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:33,440
We're good.

1887
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:33,739
We're good.

1888
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:34,340
We pulled that back.

1889
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:34,940
That was clutch.

1890
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:36,440
We forgot.

1891
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:37,139
Just pull it back.

1892
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:37,739
Pull it back.

1893
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,639
Can you get the dodge?

1894
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:39,239
Yes.

1895
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,329
Hey guys, we're good.

1896
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,099
We're good.

1897
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,780
We've gained back so much ground.

1898
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,639
Yeah, good job.

1899
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:55,230
You too.

1900
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,230
Oh, I forgot to get the magic shell.

1901
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,559
I pushed mid tower as well.

1902
01:07:01,659 --> 01:07:04,059
Our team is going to scale like crazy, by the way.

1903
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,579
What do I do in this scenario?

1904
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,119
I think at this point we have to just kind of be together.

1905
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,219
Okay.

1906
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:14,579
All right.

1907
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:17,380
I'm going to actually wait for my Pridwin or whatever it's called.

1908
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:18,880
We have to move as a unit.

1909
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,380
I got it.

1910
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:20,780
Fire giant.

1911
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,579
Is she scary?

1912
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,179
We could try to do Goal Fury.

1913
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:23,880
Very scary.

1914
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
You want to try to go?

1915
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,579
Fire giant Baron.

1916
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:28,380
I feel like we're under leveled still compared to them though.

1917
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,079
That's kind of scary.

1918
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,039
Yeah, I kind of want to race out of math.

1919
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:33,239
They're going to push race out of math though.

1920
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:34,239
They're pushing race out of math.

1921
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:37,800
How many are in right right now?

1922
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,900
We're so under leveled though.

1923
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,300
How many are 16?

1924
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,099
How many are 13?

1925
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,699
Yeah.

1926
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,500
Well, he has three kills.

1927
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:52,210
We need camps though, but every time we get near camps.

1928
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,409
They just finished Pyro.

1929
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:54,909
Oh shit.

1930
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:55,510
That's scary.

1931
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,610
I'm coming over to you.

1932
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,809
I'm just trying to get away.

1933
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,909
Yeah.

1934
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:00,309
Come to me.

1935
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,610
Come to me.

1936
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,809
They're all here.

1937
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,389
What the fuck is going on on my screen?

1938
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,699
Get me the fuck out.

1939
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,199
Yeah.

1940
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:14,699
Watch out.

1941
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:15,099
She's on.

1942
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:15,900
She's right in there.

1943
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah, I'm just running away.

1944
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,100
Wait, should we just push?

1945
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,600
Yeah, I would just push the right lane.

1946
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:25,979
Oh, they're coming.

1947
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:26,880
Yeah, they're wrapping up.

1948
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,939
Yeah, I think they're coming.

1949
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:31,939
I'm leaving right side.

1950
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:32,739
I'm leaving right side.

1951
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:33,939
A lot of coming going on.

1952
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:35,539
You like that?

1953
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,340
Yeah.

1954
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:39,739
All right.

1955
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:40,140
You're here.

1956
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,039
Wait, I like this guy.

1957
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:41,739
Can you go check it?

1958
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,039
Maybe you could solo farm and then I rotate.

1959
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:46,739
I can't I'm so I'm dying every time.

1960
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,880
We just all we have to do is make sure we have words on fire.

1961
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,380
Giant.

1962
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,180
They never do that.

1963
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:54,880
We're fine.

1964
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,279
What is God fury?

1965
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:57,380
Gold fury.

1966
01:08:58,079 --> 01:08:58,680
It's dragon.

1967
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,779
Basically the right thing.

1968
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:00,279
What is this?

1969
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,279
It's gone.

1970
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:03,579
Let's fucking push this tower.

1971
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:10,829
Okay, but one is in mid blown is the scariest of their whole team

1972
01:09:10,829 --> 01:09:11,829
so far in the dodgy.

1973
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,869
Yeah, she hard.

1974
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:15,569
Yeah, you guys be careful.

1975
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,069
They're going to collapse.

1976
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,069
Yeah, yeah, leave right away.

1977
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:19,670
All right.

1978
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:20,069
Cool.

1979
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:20,970
Oh God, of course.

1980
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,869
I'm the slowest one buffers up.

1981
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,560
I'm so scared.

1982
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:28,960
They in mid right now.

1983
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:30,159
Yeah, let's go.

01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:30,260
Let's go.

1985
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,659
Let's go.

1986
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:31,260
Let's go.

1987
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,859
I have my own coming coming coming.

1988
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,810
She's your ult on the AD carry.

1989
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,609
What's the name Freya?

1990
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:41,069
I'm ready.

1991
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:41,470
I'm ready.

1992
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:43,859
Go for it.

1993
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,039
I got one.

1994
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:50,539
No, I miss my own.

1995
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,710
Don't let that dodge you get away.

1996
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:00,850
Let's go.

1997
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,449
Let's go.

1998
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,460
I got flash.

1999
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:10,550
There it is.

2000
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,949
There it is.

2001
01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:12,649
And that's how you bring the goddamn game back.

2002
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:14,649
Let's get gold fury.

2003
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,050
Go fury.

2004
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,550
Go fury.

2005
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,550
Gold fury is gone.

2006
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:17,149
Oh shit.

2007
01:10:17,149 --> 01:10:18,250
We can get a fire giant.

2008
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,550
Can you think we could do it?

2009
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:20,449
Should we do it?

2010
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,250
We got to do something, right?

2011
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:22,850
Yeah.

2012
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:23,750
Well, yeah, let's let's go.

2013
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,550
Let's go captain.

2014
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,350
This is your kill.

2015
01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:26,350
Let's get the pyro guy.

2016
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,550
It might be too late now.

2017
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,449
Oh, let's push tower.

2018
01:10:29,449 --> 01:10:29,850
I don't know.

2019
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:30,750
I don't play this game.

2020
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,850
You have guides motherfucker.

2021
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,350
Let's just push mid tower.

2022
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:37,850
I should have definitely bought but it's fine.

2023
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:39,550
I don't understand.

2024
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:40,449
Oh my why?

2025
01:10:41,789 --> 01:10:42,989
Guys the towers.

2026
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:46,689
How many how many how many?

2027
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:47,989
Of course, bro.

2028
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:50,090
I pull back pull back pull back pull back pull back.

2029
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:50,890
No, not worth it.

2030
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:51,289
They're up.

2031
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:51,590
They're up.

2032
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,789
They're up.

2033
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,090
They're up.

2034
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,489
They're all up.

2035
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,390
That's her little lift ability.

2036
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:56,289
Yeah.

2037
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,590
If you got money spend it because we brought the game back.

2038
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,590
So if you got money spend it.

2039
01:11:03,109 --> 01:11:03,710
Good stuff.

2040
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,699
Why can't I upgrade my sentinels?

2041
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:07,899
I wanted to be one know why.

2042
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,300
Is it is it maxed out?

2043
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,630
It's like what is it?

2044
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,130
Is that your starter item?

2045
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,130
Yeah, you got to wait till level 20.

2046
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:18,699
That's that.

2047
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:20,399
That's the last thing that you're going to upgrade.

2048
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:24,840
Yeah, that's the last item you're going to upgrade.

2049
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:33,060
We're going to scale really well here if we can keep us up.

2050
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:35,989
Wait poke.

2051
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:38,130
Yo.

2052
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,729
Oh my god.

2053
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:40,529
I was so close.

2054
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:44,250
Are you saying right side?

2055
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:46,350
Are they going for fire giant?

2056
01:11:48,829 --> 01:11:49,130
Let's fight it.

2057
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:49,529
Let's fight it.

2058
01:11:56,789 --> 01:11:57,090
Good.

2059
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:57,390
Good.

2060
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:57,890
Good.

2061
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:01,899
I see the Bologna.

2062
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,399
I'm coming.

2063
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:05,239
We can maybe fire giant.

2064
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:05,840
Stop this guy.

2065
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,439
Let's fire giant.

2066
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:06,840
Let's fire giant.

2067
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,539
Let's fire giant then.

2068
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,539
But there's a lot of me here.

2069
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:09,939
Hold on.

2070
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,699
We need tank.

2071
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:13,699
Oh boy.

2072
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:14,199
We've done it.

2073
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:14,600
I would go.

2074
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,600
We're not over here.

2075
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,100
We're not out here.

2076
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:16,800
All right.

2077
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,199
Let's get it.

2078
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:17,800
Oh my god.

2079
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,399
I'm going to die for the fucking fire giant.

2080
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,310
I got to get out of here.

2081
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,210
I'm going to die from fire giant.

2082
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:23,810
I have to leave.

2083
01:12:24,909 --> 01:12:25,409
Okay.

2084
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:27,310
We can we can we can.

2085
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:30,010
Well, it's not that we're not strong.

2086
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:30,710
It's this fire.

2087
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,310
We need a we need a we need a tank to take that take the hits though.

2088
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,210
I'm dumb.

2089
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,909
Sorry, but our right side is being pushed.

2090
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:42,810
So I can't yeah, I'm fucking one HP.

2091
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,609
It's like hard.

2092
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:46,210
Word beside all of you as long as I'm here.

2093
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:47,909
We took the lead here.

2094
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, I almost died.

2095
01:12:51,609 --> 01:12:53,010
No, I'm pushing right.

2096
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:53,710
I'm going to come right side.

2097
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,180
They're all they might be thinking to do fire.

2098
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:01,590
I'll be there in a second.

2099
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Yeah, they have balona to right side.

2100
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,960
So they are going to take it.

2101
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:06,960
Yeah, they're taking it.

2102
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,359
They're taking it.

2103
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:08,260
Yeah, go go go.

2104
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:08,560
Let's go.

2105
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,260
Me and you know, they're doing the fireman sir guy.

2106
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,159
Oh, they're doing the fireman sir.

2107
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,659
Oh, I shouldn't help you.

2108
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:15,560
Oh, they're doing.

2109
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,460
Yeah, you see it now.

2110
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,159
I'm gonna go by.

2111
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:18,560
We have them.

2112
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,460
What do we do about that?

2113
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:21,859
No, we're not.

2114
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,960
We probably 2020 hindsight.

2115
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,859
Yeah, let's get it over.

2116
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,260
We probably should have killed the fireman sir.

2117
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:29,859
2020 hindsight there.

2118
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,170
Gailing hard right now to push right side.

2119
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,760
Still have no gold.

2120
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,060
How?

2121
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:38,659
They're right here.

2122
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:39,760
Watch mid.

2123
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm with you brother.

2124
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,260
Yeah.

2125
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,909
I think they got two or three here.

2126
01:13:43,909 --> 01:13:44,510
Yeah, watch it.

2127
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,109
Yeah.

2128
01:13:45,109 --> 01:13:45,810
Let's back off.

2129
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,510
Well, I'm full build right now.

2130
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:50,279
They're all in this right side here.

2131
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,279
I wish I had a ward to be honest.

2132
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:53,479
I'm nowhere close to my full build.

2133
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,819
Well, if we there's a power site.

2134
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,199
It'd be now for me.

2135
01:13:58,199 --> 01:13:59,600
It was Primal Fury thing.

2136
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,500
Wait, wait, you're no, no, no.

2137
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,000
There were people literally just seen over here.

2138
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,399
I think they they're gonna do fire.

2139
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:04,300
We could fuck with this.

2140
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,979
I think they're doing it right now.

2141
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:06,880
Let's go.

2142
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,479
Let's let's fuck with it.

2143
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:07,880
I'm coming.

2144
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:10,180
I'm just I'm just gonna go in there and just just I'm just

2145
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,180
gonna just kind of cause it.

2146
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:12,079
I'm behind poke.

2147
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:13,180
Okay, it's already dead.

2148
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:13,680
It's dead.

2149
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,380
Shit.

2150
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,180
Primal Fury then can we kill the Primal Fury?

2151
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:18,680
They're coming in real hard.

2152
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,079
I'm coming coming coming.

2153
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,380
We have to play very defensive.

2154
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,079
We have to play very defensive.

2155
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:26,380
Watch out, we need to form poke, form poke.

2156
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,180
I got to leave you.

2157
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:28,979
I just got fucking.

2158
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,579
Shit.

2159
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:32,079
Oh, I just flashed into it.

2160
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,279
I thought they were on the other side.

2161
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:35,880
Oh no.

2162
01:14:35,979 --> 01:14:37,779
Oh, that was fucking big.

2163
01:14:37,779 --> 01:14:39,180
That was actually huge.

2164
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,600
Oh, damn it.

2165
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,399
No, no, they're all they're all low.

2166
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:49,300
I saw.

2167
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,300
They can't push because I'm alive.

2168
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,159
But okay.

2169
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,529
I think they're doing gold period.

2170
01:14:56,529 --> 01:14:57,229
I just want you.

2171
01:14:57,229 --> 01:15:01,130
I'm trying to feed you sure for like you already full build.

2172
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:01,630
There's no more.

2173
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,329
I'm off.

2174
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:06,359
I feel like I don't do damage.

2175
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:07,460
I should have just pulled back.

2176
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,760
My nerves are too high.

2177
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:10,760
It's okay.

2178
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,260
It's okay.

2179
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,260
Right.

2180
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,960
And then all right, we we got to start winning team fights.

2181
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,960
That's the only way well, we've won every single team fight so

2182
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,560
far.

2183
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,460
Yeah from from the this part going forward.

2184
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:32,750
I'm just going to stay next to you sure for to be honest.

2185
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:33,449
I'm honest.

2186
01:15:33,449 --> 01:15:37,319
I can also like solo push left hard, but I don't TP.

2187
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:39,119
I'm going to let you solo push right side.

2188
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,119
Maybe so you can get this book right here.

2189
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,420
Whoa.

2190
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,020
Why wouldn't do that?

2191
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:43,819
Oh wait that buff.

2192
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:44,119
Okay.

2193
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,420
Well phrase somewhere near just saying so watch out but I am

2194
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,520
like kind of hidden back here.

2195
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,520
When does their fire giant run out?

2196
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,449
It's like four minutes, but they have it.

2197
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,350
It's a long time.

2198
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,220
I mean, they haven't gotten anything from it yet.

2199
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,420
Make sure you're buying wards.

2200
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,319
Give extra gold.

2201
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:02,520
There are two right side.

2202
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,319
They're getting me.

2203
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:03,819
They're getting me.

2204
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:06,020
Yeah, I'm getting ganked brother.

2205
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:13,140
It's a tower to the other else down.

2206
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:16,130
They were in the fucking jungle.

2207
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:17,630
They used to be caught out.

2208
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:19,680
Now shit.

2209
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,079
They're all here.

2210
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:22,579
Yeah, they're all pushing me hard.

2211
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,489
They can't really push if I'm at the tower.

2212
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:33,640
I'm going to try to push mid and just like yeah, we have I'm

2213
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,239
not sure what the what the play here is.

2214
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,149
We just have to wait until they mess up really.

2215
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,340
Damn, you do so much damage.

2216
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:40,739
It's done.

2217
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:41,340
You have a stun.

2218
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,199
It's like it's 20.

2219
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,100
Yeah, I can board bottom left.

2220
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,500
Bottom left.

2221
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,100
If I board, you want to kill?

2222
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:49,600
There we go.

2223
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,600
No, there's three though.

2224
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,199
There's three.

2225
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,159
I'm going left side.

2226
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,260
I can fight the Deja.

2227
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,659
I'm going to wait in the jungle because she's probably going

2228
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:58,159
to dash through.

2229
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:06,930
I'm going to fuck with him guys.

2230
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:10,229
I'm trying to get out my ults up and I flash my ults up and

2231
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,729
I flash.

2232
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:11,630
I didn't know the command.

2233
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:12,729
I can help you guys.

2234
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:15,229
I thought she was going to dash in the jungle to get away.

2235
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:16,130
Turn when I'm there.

2236
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:17,630
I got her there already gone.

2237
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,510
I thought that she was going to jump into the jungle to get

2238
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,170
away from you, but I killed her though.

2239
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:24,210
Okay.

2240
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:24,409
Good.

2241
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:24,609
Good.

2242
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:24,909
Good.

2243
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,529
I was waiting for the escape.

2244
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:32,430
Xp camp up.

2245
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:34,609
Everybody at 20.

2246
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:35,909
Sweetie.

2247
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,189
Poke near me and they're doing the obelisk shit too.

2248
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,890
Damn it.

2249
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,750
They just got objectives right now like hard.

2250
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,750
Yeah, we need we need to do objectives.

2251
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,050
I think we got to kind of group.

2252
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:50,149
We got to group up at this point.

2253
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:53,149
Yeah, I think we are ready for a team fight.

2254
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:59,680
I think we actually have to like you're so fast.

2255
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:01,180
I know speed buff.

2256
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,039
I'm kind of scared to go with you because if I go with you

2257
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:09,039
then I can't leave you like I can get out and I can't they

2258
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:10,939
doing as if it's fire giant back up, but they're not they're

2259
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:11,640
not doing that again.

2260
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,039
Are they?

2261
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,439
No, it's not up yet.

2262
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,239
I mean you can wait for one more item for my powerslake

2263
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,640
and then I get a buff right side.

2264
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,039
Yeah, I got to complete my last item.

2265
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,039
What my buff right side might get killed here.

2266
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:26,739
I'm just going to push left.

2267
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,270
It's dead.

2268
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:29,869
Nevermind.

2269
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:32,800
We can hear the sadness.

2270
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,350
How long does last?

2271
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:37,550
Okay.

2272
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,949
Well, it's their fire buff has been gone.

2273
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:42,250
Yeah, I'm so scared to sit inside jungle.

2274
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,920
So I'm just going to chill come push with me.

2275
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:45,920
Okay.

2276
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:48,119
Well right now they're just waiting to gank.

2277
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,520
Yeah, I was going to say that's why I feel like we shouldn't

2278
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,520
push Freya was left side right there.

2279
01:18:52,819 --> 01:18:56,020
So yeah, they're doing the pyromancer.

2280
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,319
Oh fuck.

2281
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:01,449
I don't know if Giants up or not because we don't have a ward.

2282
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:02,649
They're all on left side.

2283
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:14,920
I think you notice it's I don't know the timing.

2284
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:18,359
So when these objectives are up usually that if you as long

2285
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:21,460
as you have a word your vision on them, you can see I think

2286
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:21,960
I was muted.

2287
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:22,460
Sorry.

2288
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,659
It's fine.

2289
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,460
They're all probably just right here.

2290
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,659
I think we have to go in we have to we have to we have to go

2291
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:31,560
in going to go in here.

2292
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:39,520
This is a big deal if we can get this.

2293
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,020
This is a huge deal.

2294
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:43,920
Oh boy.

2295
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,319
All right.

2296
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:44,720
That's big.

2297
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,319
That's a big deal.

2298
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:45,819
Big deal.

2299
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,510
Did we they won't be able to finish fire.

2300
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:53,310
They can't get fire.

2301
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:53,810
That's right.

2302
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:56,760
So that was a 45.

2303
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,460
So it's fine.

2304
01:19:58,789 --> 01:19:59,689
I'm almost full build.

2305
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:07,500
I sell dust hole and I make invent and venom or something.

2306
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:11,739
Oh no.

2307
01:20:11,739 --> 01:20:12,239
Oh shit.

2308
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,239
I have to yeah, I have to upgrade my last title.

2309
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:15,739
You can upgrade it.

2310
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,100
Defend left side Phoenix.

2311
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,100
They're trying to push Phoenix.

2312
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:19,800
Got it.

2313
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:22,289
Yeah, that that's the last item you upgrade.

2314
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,390
What's happening in the races?

2315
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:24,689
Should I do nothing about it?

2316
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:27,939
I mean, that's a catapult.

2317
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:29,039
We just have to deal with that later.

2318
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:32,500
Okay, it destroys their towers.

2319
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,260
But I'll be full.

2320
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:40,890
They're they're trying to like she use her all.

2321
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,359
She's waiting for the item real quick thing.

2322
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,960
Yeah, I'm waiting 10 seconds or so.

2323
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,859
Was that her all which I push right?

2324
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:50,760
I push right side alone.

2325
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,260
Should I push right?

2326
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,960
I'm on a pillar.

2327
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,560
That's her all.

2328
01:20:52,659 --> 01:20:55,560
Yeah, head right side because we get they're gonna they're all

2329
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,260
in the left side.

2330
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:04,670
Hi, four, three, two, one.

2331
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,069
Come on.

2332
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:07,619
Come on.

2333
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:09,420
Wait, I'll come right side.

2334
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:09,920
I guess.

2335
01:21:10,819 --> 01:21:13,220
Are there any objectives up that we need to worry about?

2336
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,020
We could try gold fire.

2337
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,520
Go furious.

2338
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,020
Go furious.

2339
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,119
Not even worth doing right now.

2340
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:19,020
Everyone's pretty much full.

2341
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,520
Well, every fight is going to be around the left side of the

2342
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,020
map right now.

2343
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:22,319
Okay.

2344
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:26,460
We just need more than we should just push out.

2345
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,760
We should push out right side a little bit and then just maybe

2346
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,760
everybody control left.

2347
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:33,859
I'm gonna go to base real quick and get my my Invenom shit.

2348
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,159
Yeah, I need to eat some stuff.

2349
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:37,579
Who's that?

2350
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,399
They're on the mid.

2351
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:47,689
Freya and someone else actually Freya just went left side

2352
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:49,090
camp or left side jungle.

2353
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:49,590
You need to go left side.

2354
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:49,789
Careful.

2355
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:50,090
Careful.

2356
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:50,689
Whoever's left.

2357
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:52,090
I'm out.

2358
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:52,489
I'm out.

2359
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:59,630
Could they be on the anything on the left side of the map?

2360
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:01,329
No, right?

2361
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:03,529
To giant.

2362
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:08,880
We need to get close to giant so I can put a ward.

2363
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,779
Oh, they're doing it right now.

2364
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,079
Shit.

2365
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:16,479
Shit.

2366
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,680
I thought I could put a trap and run.

2367
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,079
Oh my God.

2368
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:19,880
I'm stupid.

2369
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:21,279
Oh God.

2370
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:21,979
They're coming.

2371
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,380
They're coming.

2372
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,079
Play the towers.

2373
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:24,579
Play the tower.

2374
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:26,079
Yeah, I just stay in tower.

2375
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,079
What one shot me.

2376
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:27,779
Oh my God.

2377
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,680
You got pulled in by her ult.

2378
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:30,579
I'd be pretty strong.

2379
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:31,579
I'm pretty we're pretty strong.

2380
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:33,779
They can't like if they push I'm just going to all because I

2381
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:36,479
can just they have to tower dive against me or else they

2382
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:38,479
can't really push that for a minute.

2383
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:39,680
Yep.

2384
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,180
Oh my God.

2385
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,479
It's a long countdown.

2386
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,970
I got a track and then suck them in.

2387
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,470
I'll be honest.

2388
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,170
You could you could do it.

2389
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,170
You got a good one.

2390
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,970
We don't need to force a fight that fire giant.

2391
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,770
No, but if I suck them under the tower, that's easy.

2392
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:58,720
When like we just know if they want to push they're all going

2393
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,420
to have beads.

2394
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,020
I'm imagining they're probably all going to use it.

2395
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:01,619
Yeah.

2396
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:02,920
Left side of the map seen pushed.

2397
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,180
Yeah, they're going to split push.

2398
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,380
I need to eat some more minions for them.

2399
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:13,500
I need to eat some minions.

2400
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,159
All right.

2401
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,359
Left is pretty empty for mid right now.

2402
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:23,760
Yeah.

2403
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,630
Going back mid.

2404
01:23:31,819 --> 01:23:33,220
We should know how long their buff is.

2405
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,210
I don't see anybody over here.

2406
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,329
Are they still for in mid where they went?

2407
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,699
They're probably just serious.

2408
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:49,300
Yeah, only fury.

2409
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,899
Are they going to get kill fury?

2410
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:52,899
All right.

2411
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:54,560
All right.

2412
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,460
Now we got a we got to think about making a move here.

2413
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:02,079
Well, this is whatever it is to just wait until it's off.

2414
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:03,680
Yep, they're going right side.

2415
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,779
We can we hyper push left.

2416
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:10,090
Yeah, we could try.

2417
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,390
You could try to get tower and left.

2418
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,979
How many are they all in right side?

2419
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,579
Yeah, they're all right.

2420
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,779
Push push push left if you just hold it.

2421
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,779
Yeah, I think they're going for a win here.

2422
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,479
They're going for win.

2423
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:22,880
They're going to try to end the game.

2424
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:26,149
Okay.

2425
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,550
I'm dead.

2426
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:28,750
Yeah, they're trying to end the game right now.

2427
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:35,819
That's that's very old down.

2428
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,739
I was just terrified.

2429
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:43,939
I just fucking press that button.

2430
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:48,539
My god, they're doing a lot of damage.

2431
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,840
They bet they got it back up though.

2432
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:50,439
They're backing.

2433
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,449
I'm pushing this.

2434
01:25:03,149 --> 01:25:03,750
Oh God.

2435
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:04,750
Oh no.

2436
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:09,329
Oh, he can do that.

2437
01:25:09,329 --> 01:25:10,029
Oh God.

2438
01:25:11,229 --> 01:25:12,229
Oh guys.

2439
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:18,340
Wow, they can just tower dive.

2440
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:22,430
They didn't necessarily tower dive.

2441
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:24,289
Yikes.

2442
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:26,090
I'm up in six seconds.

2443
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:27,189
Oh fuck.

2444
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,689
I'm dead.

2445
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,590
I think this is it.

2446
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,189
I think this is it.

2447
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,590
Yeah, that's a guess for our game.

2448
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:34,689
We'll see if I can clutch out or not.

2449
01:25:34,689 --> 01:25:35,989
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

2450
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,489
This was this was the team.

2451
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,689
This was the team to beat by the way.

2452
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:42,189
That's what we've been told.

2453
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:44,569
So this was the team.

2454
01:25:44,869 --> 01:25:47,170
No, he didn't say this was the team to beat.

2455
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:50,569
Oh, he said it was one of the strongest ones.

2456
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:56,060
Oh, I use my beads, but like it didn't work.

2457
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,359
It didn't get me out of the swirly.

2458
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:02,130
I use species you can't get out of.

2459
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:06,760
I'm pretty sure I genuinely think my biggest problem is knowing

2460
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,460
positioning.

2461
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,460
I got caught out so many times early game.

2462
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,060
I think we did our warm-up game.

2463
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:12,960
I think we did good though.

2464
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:13,960
I mean, come on.

2465
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,659
Wait, I think that was a good.

2466
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:16,659
I think that was a good show.

2467
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:18,060
I think it was a good showing.

2468
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,000
We lost the wands up, dude.

2469
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:22,500
Yes, you did.

2470
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,600
You did better than I thought you would have to that start.

2471
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,399
I get kind of shit on but it's all right.

2472
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:30,640
You guys got to I know it's hard the beat none of you are

2473
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,439
beadsing like you use your beads.

2474
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:33,840
So you don't get CC.

2475
01:26:34,039 --> 01:26:35,140
So like what is beads?

2476
01:26:35,539 --> 01:26:36,039
That's right.

2477
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,939
Yeah, you use those do before you get CC.

2478
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:43,239
So like that dude would go up on the bottom thing and change

2479
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:43,340
you.

2480
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,640
That's when you would beat so he wouldn't pull you look at

2481
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,840
your first player damage.

2482
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:48,939
How much damage did I do?

2483
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:49,539
I do a lot.

2484
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:50,640
I did nothing.

2485
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,539
I needed to do more to show up to practice last night.

2486
01:26:53,539 --> 01:26:54,140
We would have won.

2487
01:26:54,439 --> 01:27:00,140
We had a we had a team practice yesterday and we could have

2488
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,140
been on the same thing.

2489
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:01,640
No, I'm just kidding.

2490
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:04,760
Nobody told me dude.

2491
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:08,659
I didn't know you guys were looking at the OTK shows chat.

2492
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:12,460
Okay, I would have expected to DM me on Twitter be like,

2493
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,359
yo, dude, we're practicing right now.

2494
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,560
I'm like, oh shoot.

2495
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:16,260
Let's go crack.

2496
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:19,159
Do you guys have pings disabled on discord?

2497
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,560
Yeah, I have everything disabled on this rely on the most

2498
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,760
lazy guy on the team.

2499
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,159
Yeah, you know me.

2500
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,680
Yeah, I think that that would we did good though.

2501
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,479
That was a good that was a good showing.

2502
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:33,979
You guys are we're not doing that.

2503
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,279
Your next game should be easier.

2504
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:35,779
You need to win.

2505
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:38,779
I agree and your last game is going to be your you guys need

2506
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:39,579
to step up again.

2507
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:39,979
All right.

2508
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:45,060
Well, yeah started early like the start of the game Russell

2509
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:45,960
takes the green book.

2510
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:51,460
Yeah, I know and then I'll be more aggressive in lane.

2511
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,060
Yeah, you need to start your three Russell.

2512
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,159
What's my first item?

2513
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:03,060
I should start my three three pots or you all potions.

2514
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:06,460
Yeah, that's all you need is potion and then transcendence.

2515
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:06,960
You'll finish.

2516
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,060
It's a morning star is the tier one item, but you'll go transcendence.

2517
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:10,859
I'll type it out again.

2518
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:11,960
Like no, no, I see.

2519
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,960
Very cool.

2520
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:14,960
Yeah, then I get transcendence.

2521
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:18,000
Yes, or whatever item that you had.

2522
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,300
Yeah, I can see you guys again.

2523
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:25,380
We tried we tried but I needed that warm up though.

2524
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:26,920
They were good team.

2525
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,060
We got to be more.

2526
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,060
We got to be better about trying to get the objectives to those

2527
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,159
just like a fire giant.

2528
01:28:31,659 --> 01:28:35,590
Fuck that was fun.

2529
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:36,489
This games fun.

2530
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:37,989
I just got to be better at it.

2531
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:45,140
We pulled that back.

2532
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:48,680
I'm very proud of this team then you can start fucking around.

2533
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:49,479
Oh, okay.

2534
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:49,880
Okay.

2535
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:50,579
Got it.

2536
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,510
I'll have a phone call my mom.

2537
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:54,369
Yeah, you got to answer.

2538
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:55,569
Hi mom.

2539
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,670
Am I going to play Anubis?

2540
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:05,369
No.

2541
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:10,319
Yeah, I think I'm going to stick to Aries.

2542
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,180
I think that's that's the play if we don't think I'm going to

2543
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,180
learn anything else.

2544
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:24,819
I retyped out your all's both you and folks will build in that

2545
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:25,220
order.

2546
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:32,930
Got it.

2547
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:39,170
So the next game we're going against is it Emerus team?

2548
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,050
I believe so.

2549
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:44,840
I don't know what their full thing is.

2550
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:46,539
Are there bands in the finals?

2551
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,140
Yes.

2552
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,439
Oh, no.

2553
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,640
So you're telling me if they banned my champion.

2554
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,840
I have to learn a whole new one.

2555
01:29:56,439 --> 01:29:56,840
Yeah.

2556
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,640
Well, we have to get to the finals first.

2557
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,640
That is going to get but we are going to get to the finals.

2558
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,039
I think we're going to get to the finals.

2559
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:05,640
Which mid do you think I should play?

2560
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,739
I mean you had like 50,000 player damage.

2561
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:11,640
Yeah.

2562
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,039
No, you should definitely do whatever you did.

2563
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:13,640
Do that again.

2564
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:14,939
You were your own team.

2565
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,739
I was wondering if there's something that has before pressure.

2566
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,239
No, you was you were doing was like a perfect and I don't think

2567
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,239
hair would be any different.

2568
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,739
You guys should have won the game when you killed everybody

2569
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:24,840
and Russell wasn't right.

2570
01:30:25,539 --> 01:30:26,739
Sorry Russell, but you fucked him.

2571
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:27,640
Oh, yeah.

2572
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,239
When we got fired there.

2573
01:30:29,539 --> 01:30:30,640
Yeah, when the game of it.

2574
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:32,239
Yeah, what happened?

2575
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:34,840
When you were in right and they want to fight you want to do

2576
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,539
fire you need you're like your character is be in front of

2577
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:40,239
everybody start every fight be at every fight never be by

2578
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:40,739
yourself.

2579
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,140
Yeah.

2580
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,140
All right.

2581
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,840
That is good to know that is very good to know you should

2582
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,539
die first.

2583
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:46,439
You should be like the first one.

2584
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:47,539
Here you can play that.

2585
01:30:47,539 --> 01:30:50,039
He has to like stay behind everybody and do not try to do

2586
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:50,739
the fire dragon.

2587
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:54,039
I don't want to play any other character Ares is definitely

2588
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:54,439
the one.

2589
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:56,810
Trust trust.

2590
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,510
There's going to be a character he could play that he does

2591
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,210
nothing on.

2592
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,609
No, no, no, no on Ares.

2593
01:31:00,609 --> 01:31:03,710
If you start your three instead of your one, he'll do what

2594
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:04,909
you want to do in lane.

2595
01:31:06,909 --> 01:31:10,109
I mean we can trade lanes to can I 80 carry in the lane and

2596
01:31:10,109 --> 01:31:12,609
work with no, we're fine.

2597
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:13,409
We just fucked up early.

2598
01:31:13,409 --> 01:31:16,210
We got oh, I mean if I'm being completely honest by Artemis

2599
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,109
fucking sucked.

2600
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:19,210
Okay, look at the damage and it's true.

2601
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:21,210
Yeah, because I had no one to fucking support me.

2602
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:24,810
Oh, maybe we should change.

2603
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:25,409
Maybe we should do.

2604
01:31:25,409 --> 01:31:27,909
I mean, this is support my fucking finger in your ass.

2605
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:30,909
You guys you guys are at each other's throats.

2606
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,149
Really like it.

2607
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,750
This is nothing compared to what some apex players say to

2608
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:38,250
each other.

2609
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,420
Make sure you guys have cool avatars too, because that's

2610
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:44,920
important.

2611
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:45,819
Sure.

2612
01:31:45,819 --> 01:31:46,720
I had the skin buff.

2613
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:49,979
I played this game.

2614
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,869
Didn't you didn't you not like Uler?

2615
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:55,470
I feel like you were saying I don't like I just didn't like

2616
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,270
the third guy.

2617
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:57,270
I played the ninja character.

2618
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:57,869
Okay.

2619
01:31:59,069 --> 01:32:01,899
Yeah, I get a fresh start.

2620
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,020
I think Uler is too hard.

2621
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:04,819
No, he's not.

2622
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,539
He's not hard.

2623
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:09,130
Just was born.

2624
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,229
I mean great on Artemis too.

2625
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:14,130
Like you guys made a lot of plays very good job.

2626
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:17,729
Your early game screwed you like really really hard.

2627
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:19,729
I just think I wasn't impactful enough to be honest.

2628
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:22,029
Well, yeah, you have had your first game.

2629
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:24,529
So and that's also how it all works.

2630
01:32:24,529 --> 01:32:25,930
You're on an island for the most part.

2631
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,729
Did I get an F on my report card weekend?

2632
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:31,229
So pretty much I should just farm like a like a D.

2633
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:35,329
Yeah, I miss some of your plays.

2634
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:36,229
So you did some stuff, right?

2635
01:32:36,229 --> 01:32:38,829
Like when you guys traded you and no code kill the guy in left

2636
01:32:38,829 --> 01:32:39,229
and no good.

2637
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:39,829
That's fine.

2638
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:40,529
Like you have fires.

2639
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:41,029
That was good.

2640
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:41,430
Okay.

2641
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:46,430
So we basically see doing is trying to alpha your laner

2642
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:49,229
and if you've ever out of them you steal all the camps around

2643
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:53,729
you like the other thing poke if you play Artemis your ultimate

2644
01:32:53,729 --> 01:32:54,729
is the same as beats.

2645
01:32:54,729 --> 01:32:56,130
They can't CC you or anything.

2646
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:58,130
So yeah, I realize that too late.

2647
01:32:58,229 --> 01:33:00,329
Yeah, you could just all same for you.

2648
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:02,630
Your alts will make you CC immune.

2649
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:03,130
Really?

2650
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,729
I didn't know that you could just all and then it'll help you

2651
01:33:05,729 --> 01:33:10,529
get away to your to make you move faster and you attack faster.

2652
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:12,529
Doesn't remove slows and shit or not.

2653
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:13,829
My yeah, my room is also.

2654
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:18,630
It shouldn't matter once if you're all thing in that anyway,

2655
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:20,729
it'll just you'll be CC immune everything.

2656
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,789
Lenses slows and becomes immune to slows.

2657
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:29,989
Yeah, when you want to do fire to you for could have done it.

2658
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,890
You just needed whoever was healthiest to pull it.

2659
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,119
It's pulling better the most.

2660
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:37,619
All right.

2661
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:38,520
We got a we got a game.

2662
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,220
Yeah, you're someone else should have pulled anyone but you

2663
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:41,720
pretty much.

2664
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,819
We got a we got a game here.

2665
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,119
I did pull it right.

2666
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,020
I think you guys reset it.

2667
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,119
I was going to be first.

2668
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:49,619
If you guys are like not sure just do whatever is up like

2669
01:33:49,619 --> 01:33:52,420
if that pyromancer is up do that instead or do gold just

2670
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,220
do something.

2671
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,619
It doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're doing

2672
01:33:54,619 --> 01:33:54,920
something.

2673
01:33:57,069 --> 01:33:58,369
I'm pulling some of the game you guys good.

2674
01:33:59,069 --> 01:33:59,770
Yep ready to go.

2675
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,270
Let's go.

2676
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,369
Good and ready, baby.

2677
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,069
I'm ready.

2678
01:34:03,069 --> 01:34:08,800
La de I have listened to what we can have said and I am going

2679
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,300
to apply that knowledge to this game same.

2680
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:15,729
I feel like sure for I'm just going to why I'm going to get

2681
01:34:15,729 --> 01:34:16,329
super strong.

2682
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:17,029
Why is that?

2683
01:34:17,029 --> 01:34:18,130
Why are you on the other team?

2684
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:19,829
No, he can swap.

2685
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:24,029
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2686
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:24,829
How do I swap?

2687
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:26,729
It says I'm in your party.

2688
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,329
Yeah, you're in our party.

2689
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,229
No, the they'll swap.

2690
01:34:31,619 --> 01:34:33,220
Close that close the shit.

2691
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:33,720
You're in right now.

2692
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,619
No, go and click at the top of the number.

2693
01:34:35,619 --> 01:34:38,319
Click the number at the top the countdown or count up.

2694
01:34:40,289 --> 01:34:40,590
Okay.

2695
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:42,789
At the top middle just click on the actual number.

2696
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:45,689
Yes, click on that and then a little like refresh.

2697
01:34:45,689 --> 01:34:47,090
Click through a fresh button.

2698
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:47,590
It'll move you.

2699
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,890
There you go.

2700
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:53,489
Yes, it turned my game volume up you guys shit on this team

2701
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:55,390
like you should actually just dump through this thing.

2702
01:34:55,789 --> 01:34:57,689
You are giving me the confidence that I needed.

2703
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:59,189
That's what we like to hear.

2704
01:34:59,189 --> 01:35:01,789
We want to see some five man air results from you.

2705
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:06,689
Yes, you made some nutty plays and do crazy turns was feeling

2706
01:35:06,689 --> 01:35:07,390
the nutty plays.

2707
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:08,890
Honestly, I was actually feeling them.

2708
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:11,289
I had the nutty plays, but then I would get caught out and

2709
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,590
then I also wouldn't be in front of poke, which is another

2710
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:15,989
problem and I'm going to fix all these problems and it's

2711
01:35:15,989 --> 01:35:16,689
really late.

2712
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:18,090
Like you guys are kind of like, what do we do?

2713
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:18,689
You're running around.

2714
01:35:18,689 --> 01:35:21,090
You need to put some wards down and you need to make sure

2715
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:21,890
they just don't do fire.

2716
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:23,289
Oh, yeah, fight them.

2717
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:25,789
Yeah, I'm going to try to just this time.

2718
01:35:25,789 --> 01:35:28,289
I'm going to try to have a ward at fire giant from like

2719
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,489
five 10 minutes forward.

2720
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,960
If you get a chance, if you're that deep, put them on their

2721
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,260
side of the map on fire.

2722
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,560
Yeah, you need one on the fire and the rest just on their

2723
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:36,859
side.

2724
01:35:36,859 --> 01:35:37,460
So, you know where they are.

2725
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:40,260
Yeah, also with awards, right?

2726
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,560
It says upgrade your word.

2727
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,460
Is that when you get the magic shell or what?

2728
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,560
That's all great.

2729
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,859
Your your relic you can make them better.

2730
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,159
So yeah, like late game.

2731
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,859
Once you have your full build upgrade, whatever you want.

2732
01:35:50,859 --> 01:35:53,659
Okay, so then how do I get more awards?

2733
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:54,960
You just buy them.

2734
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,760
They just they're 50 gold and then there's a bigger one.

2735
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,560
That's 120.

2736
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,460
Oh, okay.

2737
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:00,659
The bigger one is the pink word.

2738
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:03,159
That's invisible in the early game.

2739
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,859
Just if you think about it, grab a single 50 gold word.

2740
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,460
If you don't just in the late game is where like when you

2741
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,159
get when you guys are grouped, like what the fuck do we do?

2742
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:10,859
Where are they on this?

2743
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:12,060
That's when you have to start working.

2744
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:12,460
Yep.

2745
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,060
Okay.

2746
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:17,359
And get him out there or usually just ward gold fury and

2747
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:20,359
fire giant and then after that just put it in random spots.

2748
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:22,760
Yeah, that's actually all it needs to do.

2749
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,659
Okay, let's go away.

2750
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:25,359
If you get hit.

2751
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,659
No, they'll keep taking.

2752
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,199
Yeah, if you start a fight, pop them like I can't.

2753
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:33,800
Yes, you can.

2754
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:34,600
Okay.

2755
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,500
And then what about my aegis?

2756
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,100
Do I press my E plus my aegis?

2757
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,000
Basically your aegis you want to use to not take damage.

2758
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,399
So like if you everyone's jumping on you or fucking you up,

2759
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:44,800
you want to use that but you cannot use that when you're

2760
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,199
cc'd.

2761
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,300
I give you your son.

2762
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,500
You cannot be Angie basically or whatever you can beads

2763
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,100
and then aegis.

2764
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,600
Yeah, if you need to or if you just know the damage is about

2765
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,500
to come, you can just pop.

2766
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:59,710
That's actually super smart.

2767
01:36:59,909 --> 01:37:02,909
And then I can I can but I can't cast abilities not in the

2768
01:37:02,909 --> 01:37:04,210
aegis with the beads.

2769
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:05,409
You can you beads.

2770
01:37:05,409 --> 01:37:07,609
You're like ready to fuck him up like you pop that just turn

2771
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:11,409
and start fucking wailing on beads is like BKB and the

2772
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:12,909
beads will last a couple seconds.

2773
01:37:12,909 --> 01:37:13,810
It's two seconds.

2774
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:14,109
Yep.

2775
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:16,210
Okay, so I said your fly is down.

2776
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:18,210
I don't have any clothes on that's impossible.

2777
01:37:18,609 --> 01:37:19,210
Uh-huh.

2778
01:37:19,909 --> 01:37:20,810
You're naked.

2779
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:23,020
Oh, right.

2780
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,720
I forgot a minute call for everybody.

2781
01:37:24,819 --> 01:37:26,720
You didn't you didn't tell us that you were naked.

2782
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,420
Is that what we're all supposed to be playing like so we

2783
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:29,220
can play better?

2784
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:32,119
You'll turn on the webcam like team synergy or something.

2785
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:32,720
Stand up.

2786
01:37:33,619 --> 01:37:34,520
Look at this team synergy.

2787
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:37,619
They have they all have fucking the sad Pepe face.

2788
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,520
Yeah, because that's going to be them when they lost.

2789
01:37:39,619 --> 01:37:40,119
Yeah.

2790
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:43,920
Sure for that's a fact.

2791
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,319
Shrew for God.

2792
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:49,649
Hold on a sec.

2793
01:37:49,649 --> 01:37:51,449
When do we press press play?

2794
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,949
Hold on a second guys.

2795
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:57,250
I'm opening up chest so I can get the so I can get this

2796
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,149
skin real quick.

2797
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,350
You $100 skin.

2798
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:02,739
It's going to be big.

2799
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:10,090
$100 skin or boss keep going.

2800
01:38:10,989 --> 01:38:12,090
I just got hold on.

2801
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,789
We essential bees.

2802
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:14,989
What's wrong Jerma?

2803
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:16,289
What's wrong team captain?

2804
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:19,989
I did hold on if we if we have time, but it's something

2805
01:38:19,989 --> 01:38:22,989
that I captain the team captain has something to potentially

2806
01:38:22,989 --> 01:38:23,689
show.

2807
01:38:24,289 --> 01:38:26,189
Oh, no team captain can't do it.

2808
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:27,590
You're going to show it, huh?

2809
01:38:27,689 --> 01:38:29,789
My girlfriend took a picture of me when I was sitting here.

2810
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:35,390
I got it.

2811
01:38:35,689 --> 01:38:36,590
I got it.

2812
01:38:37,289 --> 01:38:37,489
All right.

2813
01:38:37,489 --> 01:38:38,390
What do we what's going on here?

2814
01:38:39,029 --> 01:38:42,270
I got the skin was banning banning.

2815
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,060
Wait, what?

2816
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,600
No, it's a little wrong.

2817
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,510
Dude, I'm just going to pass ban.

2818
01:38:49,609 --> 01:38:50,310
That's what we're doing.

2819
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:51,510
I think they're just passing.

2820
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:52,210
Okay.

2821
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:53,210
Oh my God.

2822
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:54,909
Now we're picking.

2823
01:38:54,909 --> 01:38:55,810
No, there's no bands.

2824
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,310
Okay.

2825
01:38:58,770 --> 01:38:59,770
Can I even show this?

2826
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:08,079
Hey, stay tuned for next game when I when I show a picture

2827
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:08,979
of something funny.

2828
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:11,279
Can I frag out Azul?

2829
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,319
I have to sneeze.

2830
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,800
I feel like it's just kind of weak because I yeah, I throw

2831
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,760
the axe and then I kind of need to be confident in Russell.

2832
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,460
I got to focus right now.

2833
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:25,960
I'm okay.

2834
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:26,859
Chats going down.

2835
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:27,859
I'll show it.

2836
01:39:27,859 --> 01:39:28,760
I'll show it next game.

2837
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:29,460
You got it.

2838
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,359
You got to do what for me?

2839
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:31,460
I can't see chat anymore.

2840
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,359
He needs to be confident in you to play.

2841
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,800
I am extremely confident that I will play well here because

2842
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,399
I just opened up a skin and it's over.

2843
01:39:41,399 --> 01:39:42,100
It's GGs.

2844
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:43,970
Same.

2845
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,600
You got the cat ears.

2846
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:48,439
No, I got your mind.

2847
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:49,039
That's pokes.

2848
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:49,340
Nevermind.

2849
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:51,739
I got the higher gun Aries meow.

2850
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:55,239
What it was a one in 120 chance of getting it.

2851
01:39:56,539 --> 01:39:57,609
Meow.

2852
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,710
Meow.

2853
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,210
So their first character they picked is their jungler.

2854
01:40:01,609 --> 01:40:04,109
He has an ability that makes him not take any damage and

2855
01:40:04,109 --> 01:40:06,310
then he has three damaging abilities that are all just

2856
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:06,810
abilities.

2857
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:07,609
Thanatos.

2858
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:12,109
Thanatos where solo probably young actually.

2859
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:14,109
Okay, that might be Robin a solo Thanatos.

2860
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:16,180
Yep.

2861
01:40:16,579 --> 01:40:17,579
Is there a loser bracket?

2862
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:18,779
I don't think so.

2863
01:40:19,909 --> 01:40:21,010
So we can't get first anymore.

2864
01:40:21,409 --> 01:40:22,210
So he's a win.

2865
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:23,909
We can get out of this is a group.

2866
01:40:26,149 --> 01:40:29,850
Basically, we have to come out of this to to minimum.

2867
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:30,649
You need to win the next game.

2868
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:31,149
So be tuned.

2869
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:34,550
Yeah, when it's yeah two and one and then we play semi-finals,

2870
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:34,949
right?

2871
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,649
Oh, no, no, it's fun.

2872
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,819
I think it should be semis and then finals.

2873
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:43,420
I think I don't know.

2874
01:40:43,819 --> 01:40:49,569
Okay, I was in cabs should be in the ADC lane against you

2875
01:40:49,569 --> 01:40:49,970
guys.

2876
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:53,670
Your Ares all will bop them if it's be like he beads are

2877
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,569
his only way of getting out of it.

2878
01:40:56,869 --> 01:41:00,270
My Ares all what sorry will fuck up the amusing cab.

2879
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:01,069
They're second pick.

2880
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,369
He doesn't have any way to get out of your all other than

2881
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:03,869
his beats.

2882
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:05,270
Okay, amusing cab.

2883
01:41:06,069 --> 01:41:07,069
That's the one with the bees.

2884
01:41:07,069 --> 01:41:10,470
You told me about and that's what I'm playing against.

2885
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,869
I don't know.

2886
01:41:11,869 --> 01:41:13,670
I think you're going to be against the Robin of the first

2887
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:13,869
year.

2888
01:41:17,569 --> 01:41:21,069
He's got a route a slow and a leap that slams.

2889
01:41:22,069 --> 01:41:22,869
I'm going to piss on him.

2890
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:24,170
Huh?

2891
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:25,569
What?

2892
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:32,260
All right, guys, let's do a little pep talk here.

2893
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,460
Let's hear everybody.

2894
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:37,380
Try to do your best.

2895
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:41,149
If you don't do your best then fuck you.

2896
01:41:41,649 --> 01:41:43,050
Can you sing the song for me?

2897
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:45,710
Do you want to sing that?

2898
01:41:46,109 --> 01:41:47,109
Yeah, sing the song.

2899
01:41:48,909 --> 01:41:50,310
Try your best.

2900
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:51,609
Do your best.

2901
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:54,949
The song.

2902
01:41:55,149 --> 01:41:55,850
Wait, what happened?

2903
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,720
They didn't make a selection.

2904
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,619
They were power gaming.

2905
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:07,590
We got to pick quicker than that.

2906
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:09,789
I didn't do it.

2907
01:42:10,289 --> 01:42:11,289
Is that lobby still up?

2908
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:12,989
Am I supposed to be seeing a screen right now?

2909
01:42:12,989 --> 01:42:13,989
Because I'm not seeing a screen.

2910
01:42:13,989 --> 01:42:15,789
And Chovies was an empty planet RuneScape.

2911
01:42:15,789 --> 01:42:16,989
We should have an automatic win.

2912
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,960
That's unacceptable.

2913
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:21,960
They're power games.

2914
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,159
They're wasting everybody's time.

2915
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,760
Yeah, give us that dove.

2916
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,560
Miss.

2917
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,260
Call the miss.

2918
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,060
Report him.

2919
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,899
We should get a thousand extra gold on our team.

2920
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:32,899
Each.

2921
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:34,199
True.

2922
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:35,630
Dollars.

2923
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,029
Is that lobby up or no?

2924
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:41,970
I don't want to show it.

2925
01:42:43,069 --> 01:42:44,069
Who's the Ninja Turtle?

2926
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,350
I think it's this.

2927
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,449
This is a bunch.

2928
01:42:47,949 --> 01:42:49,649
Russell, your shit might be fucked.

2929
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:51,649
I think so.

2930
01:42:51,649 --> 01:42:52,449
I think you need a reload.

2931
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,449
Oh no.

2932
01:42:54,449 --> 01:42:56,380
It was actually good that they dodged.

2933
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,180
Okay.

2934
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:58,619
Why?

2935
01:42:59,489 --> 01:42:59,989
Resetting.

2936
01:43:00,489 --> 01:43:03,189
But like he has his numbers stuck and I don't think he was in your lobby.

2937
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:04,590
Like I don't think he could actually see it.

2938
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:04,789
Yeah.

2939
01:43:04,789 --> 01:43:05,789
I couldn't see anything.

2940
01:43:05,789 --> 01:43:06,390
That's why I wasn't.

2941
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:06,689
Oh shit.

2942
01:43:06,689 --> 01:43:07,590
I didn't know you guys were even.

2943
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:10,920
Last thing in disguise.

2944
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:21,359
Oh yeah.

2945
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:23,760
Jeremy last game you went to kill the duo lane.

2946
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:25,760
Hit level two first before you do anything like that.

2947
01:43:25,859 --> 01:43:26,159
Okay.

2948
01:43:27,939 --> 01:43:28,140
Yeah.

2949
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:31,439
Try and clear your jungle a lot first before gank ruining.

2950
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,239
Unless it's like a really obvious game.

2951
01:43:33,939 --> 01:43:35,739
Did you know that guy makes videos on this game?

2952
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,939
What are you talking to your report?

2953
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:37,640
Huh?

2954
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:38,840
Oh my bad.

2955
01:43:39,939 --> 01:43:40,939
I should know my place.

2956
01:43:40,939 --> 01:43:41,439
They needed.

2957
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:42,640
Okay.

2958
01:43:43,739 --> 01:43:46,840
I mean I I can take some light criticism though, right?

2959
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,939
I mean I got it.

2960
01:43:47,939 --> 01:43:48,439
I got it.

2961
01:43:48,739 --> 01:43:49,439
Very light.

2962
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:54,649
Like I know to not suck.

2963
01:43:54,649 --> 01:43:58,550
Just stuff stuff like stuff like oh like this game.

2964
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,659
Yeah, how are you good at this?

2965
01:44:00,659 --> 01:44:01,260
I can lie.

2966
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,560
You're really fucking.

2967
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:05,659
I'm good at every game.

2968
01:44:05,659 --> 01:44:06,159
I play.

2969
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:08,760
That is a point and overwatch.

2970
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,359
She was a pro at every character too.

2971
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:13,890
Yeah, that's actually it.

2972
01:44:13,989 --> 01:44:14,289
Yeah.

2973
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:14,989
Okay.

2974
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:15,590
How do I join?

2975
01:44:15,689 --> 01:44:18,899
Oh, I got you.

2976
01:44:18,899 --> 01:44:20,800
I'm going to join through poke.

2977
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,500
I guess I can you join through poke?

2978
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,300
I don't think you can.

2979
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:23,899
I think you need to go.

2980
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:24,899
No, that's why I did last time.

2981
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:25,300
I'm good.

2982
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:25,800
We're good.

2983
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:26,840
Oh, there we go.

2984
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,439
I'm in baby.

2985
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:30,989
He has like my icon by the way or new lobby.

2986
01:44:30,989 --> 01:44:31,390
All right.

2987
01:44:31,489 --> 01:44:32,289
Are we all in here?

2988
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:33,880
Yes.

2989
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:34,880
All right.

2990
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,079
I'm joining the new lobby.

2991
01:44:37,529 --> 01:44:38,029
Yes.

2992
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,800
Enough talk.

2993
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,239
Now it's time to chug their beer.

2994
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,439
Like are we good to go now?

2995
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:51,779
I think how do we trash talk the other team?

2996
01:44:51,779 --> 01:44:53,979
Can they see what we type you guys?

2997
01:44:53,979 --> 01:44:55,479
No, you know right now they can.

2998
01:44:55,479 --> 01:44:56,829
Yeah.

2999
01:44:57,029 --> 01:44:58,029
Oh no, you're talking to party.

3000
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:01,630
Oh, no, that's we're going to lose man.

3001
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,020
No, you guys are going to lose.

3002
01:45:05,979 --> 01:45:06,880
Oh got it.

3003
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,829
Now I can type lol XD match accepted.

3004
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:19,229
Yeah, they'll have bands on go baby.

3005
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,619
Just skip the bands for now.

3006
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,119
You're my oh, I'll just cheat it.

3007
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,420
I say we just cheat it and ban their their champs.

3008
01:45:28,119 --> 01:45:31,220
The rabbit up open up their streams ban their champs and keep

3009
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:31,720
it moving.

3010
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:38,340
What do we think in here?

3011
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:39,239
All right.

3012
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:41,279
No, don't ban Baka Sora.

3013
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:42,579
I wanted to pick Baka Sora.

3014
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,779
It would have been horrible.

3015
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:51,640
Excuse me.

3016
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,239
That'd be so funny if I did that though.

3017
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,840
I'd have to play Thanatos.

3018
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,539
I know how to play him.

3019
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:06,000
This game needs like a UI upgrade.

3020
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,739
It's just like League though.

3021
01:46:13,579 --> 01:46:14,279
Yeah, it's ugly.

3022
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:24,069
I think it's hard to do shit quick doing a UI upgrade.

3023
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:27,270
I think for a game that has this many things to look at.

3024
01:46:27,569 --> 01:46:28,369
I feel like it's hard.

3025
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:33,000
Yeah, but look at like the bottom when you hover over a

3026
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,300
character.

3027
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,300
It's like it looks so plain.

3028
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:38,960
I raise it.

3029
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,260
If you're listening ready.

3030
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:41,159
Oh, they did it ready.

3031
01:46:48,529 --> 01:46:49,630
You got here again.

3032
01:46:49,729 --> 01:46:50,130
Yeah.

3033
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:53,029
Wait, is it my turn pick?

3034
01:46:53,829 --> 01:46:54,729
Oh, she's banning.

3035
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:00,029
Emery is banning again.

3036
01:47:00,529 --> 01:47:02,029
Yeah, we have to pass it back and forth.

3037
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:06,710
Silly guys.

3038
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:07,810
Very very silly.

3039
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,760
Low magical damage.

3040
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:11,359
Uh-oh.

3041
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,960
I mean the UI definitely has been updated in this game.

3042
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,359
Because I remember playing back in like the day, you know,

3043
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:18,760
back when we were all younger.

3044
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:19,560
Oh, we don't have low magic.

3045
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:20,859
We have low magic in the UI.

3046
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,460
That's true.

3047
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:26,260
By the way, those of you that are watching the drops are

3048
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:26,859
enabled.

3049
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,460
There is a custom.

3050
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:31,359
Not custom a new a is it even new?

3051
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:31,760
I don't know.

3052
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,460
There's a skin as a cupid skin.

3053
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:39,359
It's called cupid dreadnought and it is a this if you support

3054
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:43,859
team this team here, you can potentially get that if you

3055
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:45,159
drops are enabled.

3056
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,859
So give it a look.

3057
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,359
Yeah.

3058
01:47:48,859 --> 01:47:49,760
Yeah, we're the best team.

3059
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,060
We are number one.

3060
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,260
Are you an infomercial salesman?

3061
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:55,359
I'm trying to sell it.

3062
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,159
Give me one five second tip on jungle that I didn't do last

3063
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:05,359
game.

3064
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:06,760
I need my farm more.

3065
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,560
Okay, farm a lot more.

3066
01:48:08,659 --> 01:48:09,060
Okay.

3067
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,960
I farm a lot more copy paste this.

3068
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,760
Thank you very much.

3069
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:23,359
I see you later.

3070
01:48:25,859 --> 01:48:27,560
So they got danisos in the jungle.

3071
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:30,260
I think I don't know whatever.

3072
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:32,560
He's using the misc if skin.

3073
01:48:32,859 --> 01:48:33,260
Yeah.

3074
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,760
Wait, they all have the same profile picture look like that.

3075
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:40,760
Does that mean he actually plays the game?

3076
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:41,560
We should have done that.

3077
01:48:41,659 --> 01:48:42,159
Oh boy.

3078
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,399
All right.

3079
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,699
I feel like this game is gonna go smoother.

3080
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,800
Let's make it happen.

3081
01:48:58,420 --> 01:48:59,420
Do I buy five pots?

3082
01:48:59,420 --> 01:48:59,819
Wait a minute.

3083
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,720
I have extra money.

3084
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:02,020
You buy it.

3085
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,359
You shouldn't have extra money eat speed speeds.

3086
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:07,359
That's why fucking music is too loud.

3087
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:11,239
Shut up.

3088
01:49:11,239 --> 01:49:13,539
Sure for even looking.

3089
01:49:13,539 --> 01:49:14,140
I knew it was you.

3090
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:15,239
I'm like, no, I still have money.

3091
01:49:15,239 --> 01:49:18,340
I bought death toll and she knows me in three pots.

3092
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:19,140
You just do that.

3093
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:19,739
I know.

3094
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:20,739
All right.

3095
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:23,239
How do you know heads in the game?

3096
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,800
Go to where you need to be.

3097
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,409
We got to win this one.

3098
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:30,510
I'm starting three daddy.

3099
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:33,550
I didn't buy my beads poke.

3100
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,079
Poke communicate with me.

3101
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:41,180
Remember don't take my camp or else.

3102
01:49:41,579 --> 01:49:42,180
I swear to God.

3103
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,880
I will run it down mid if you take my camp.

3104
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:44,579
No.

3105
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:46,659
Okay.

3106
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:51,250
All right guys play well play hard.

3107
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,409
We got a three Royale.

3108
01:49:54,409 --> 01:49:57,710
Yeah, for tonight without character board right now.

3109
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:59,409
Just wiped out Tomato Town.

3110
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,399
It's a different game.

3111
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:02,399
Stop singing that.

3112
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:03,199
They're back in now.

3113
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:06,000
I'm so I'm not going to be there in time.

3114
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:10,119
Oh jeez award.

3115
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,199
They hit it first.

3116
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,760
The game the game is so loud.

3117
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:17,859
Now, oops.

3118
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,060
Your game is loud.

3119
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:20,260
No, I turned it up.

3120
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,500
I'll turn it down in the game.

3121
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,199
I'll turn it down.

3122
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:30,029
Perfect.

3123
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:34,100
All right.

3124
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:34,500
Let's do it.

3125
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,500
Oh, I just got stunned.

3126
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,000
Very very confident.

3127
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,899
I don't know why but I'm feeling so wrong.

3128
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,100
They went the wrong way.

3129
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:46,579
Why does it get so loud?

3130
01:50:46,579 --> 01:50:47,979
I turned up like a tiny bit.

3131
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:51,069
All right.

3132
01:50:51,069 --> 01:50:51,470
Good luck.

3133
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,850
They're level two.

3134
01:50:53,149 --> 01:50:53,649
Thank you.

3135
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:54,550
We got a bet.

3136
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,449
Do we have to back up?

3137
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:56,949
Yeah, I feel like we have to back up because they're level two.

3138
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,939
Like the game volume went up like crazy.

3139
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:10,000
Oh, wow.

3140
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:15,760
I'm backing up as you should.

3141
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,689
Hey, help me help me help me help me in the jungle in the jungle in the jungle.

3142
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:24,590
Come come come in the jungle.

3143
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,090
Oh, I'm coming.

3144
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:26,590
I'm coming coming.

3145
01:51:27,489 --> 01:51:28,189
Careful back it up.

3146
01:51:28,189 --> 01:51:28,590
Okay.

3147
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:30,789
We could do this little totem thing.

3148
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,079
Be careful.

3149
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:34,479
They're going in.

3150
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:34,779
They're going in.

3151
01:51:34,779 --> 01:51:35,180
Careful.

3152
01:51:36,449 --> 01:51:36,750
I'm good.

3153
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:37,050
I'm good.

3154
01:51:43,779 --> 01:51:44,479
We might go to kill here.

3155
01:51:45,079 --> 01:51:46,380
Let's punish that we can.

3156
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:49,079
Now back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up.

3157
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:49,579
Not worth it.

3158
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:51,279
Oh my god.

3159
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:53,380
Bro, that ability is nuts.

3160
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,279
Not worth it.

3161
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,659
My base here.

3162
01:52:05,029 --> 01:52:06,630
I know we can start screaming right now.

3163
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,380
He's probably like, you're not supposed to be over there.

3164
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:13,939
They're low.

3165
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:14,439
They're low.

3166
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,140
Yep.

3167
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:17,340
I'm oh, I just got stunned out of my out of my three.

3168
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:20,560
I got stunned out of my three.

3169
01:52:22,579 --> 01:52:23,180
Okay, let's go.

3170
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:23,779
Let's go back.

3171
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,479
We actually back them out of lane.

3172
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:27,579
So that could be good for us.

3173
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,319
Left side is MA.

3174
01:52:36,939 --> 01:52:37,840
I'm going to get mid buff.

3175
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,250
Is there any buff that we can get while they're gone?

3176
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:47,420
Um, I don't think so.

3177
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:58,300
Left side, MA stuff.

3178
01:52:59,180 --> 01:52:59,479
Never mind.

3179
01:52:59,479 --> 01:52:59,979
He's back.

3180
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:00,680
Perfect.

3181
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:04,949
Buff is down here for one of you guys.

3182
01:53:05,449 --> 01:53:05,850
Yeah.

3183
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:09,039
We might actually have an aggressive here.

3184
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,539
Oh wait, they do have items, but oh, how you guys doing you guys?

3185
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,039
Hey guys, they're getting too though.

3186
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:20,039
They're getting their junglers.

3187
01:53:21,439 --> 01:53:23,239
Why have I ward in our jungle as well?

3188
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:25,039
Can we go do our purple thing or their purple thing?

3189
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:27,039
It's on the ground right now for you.

3190
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:29,239
The junglers at their red right now.

3191
01:53:30,439 --> 01:53:31,140
My side's going mid.

3192
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:31,840
My side's going mid.

3193
01:53:33,739 --> 01:53:36,140
I think they're going to go fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it.

3194
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:40,340
Mid's going over to you guys.

3195
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,439
Yeah, mid's going over to you guys too.

3196
01:53:44,539 --> 01:53:45,039
I'm right here.

3197
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:45,340
I'm right here.

3198
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:47,939
There's too many.

3199
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,479
They're low.

3200
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,060
Yeah, we can fight this.

3201
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:57,359
No, I went around.

3202
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,600
Oh, careful, careful, careful, careful.

3203
01:54:00,699 --> 01:54:01,399
Just get out.

3204
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,699
Oh, no.

3205
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,199
Oh, no.

3206
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:05,880
They're still betting.

3207
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:06,779
There was four.

3208
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:10,000
Oh, no, we're fine.

3209
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:13,479
All right.

3210
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:13,880
That's good.

3211
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:14,579
Our that's good.

3212
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:15,180
Oh shit.

3213
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,199
Really?

3214
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:22,060
I'm a hella nervous.

3215
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:22,760
I'm gonna be honest.

3216
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:24,800
Everything's good.

3217
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,100
Just back to square one.

3218
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:36,130
I need to board happens the best of us.

3219
01:54:36,229 --> 01:54:36,430
All right.

01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:37,329
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

3221
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:38,229
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:39,029
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

3447
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:51,739
I bought some earlier and then I just forgot it's all by like two and then

02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:15,329

They're going right

3455
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:33,360
Wait, it didn't work. Never mind. He probably beat I think we could do fire giant maybe

3456
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:36,719
We need like a pick or something first

3457
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,479
Or we have to deward us you gotta you gotta back off

3458
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:44,430

02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:46,590
All right, i'm gonna get running towards me running towards me ravena

3460
02:16:47,149 --> 02:17:07,540
Keep forgetting that that did you a job blue's down here. I feel like we shouldn't push this

3461
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:13,149
They're coming

3462
02:17:13,149 --> 02:17:15,149
How many all of them?

3463
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:20,190
We can go deep in their jungle and try and gank them

3464
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:24,909
Unless we can do enough I almost have enough we should run together then we can do fire giant

3465
02:17:25,149 --> 02:17:29,069
What if we just sit all on fire giant right now and just wait for them and we don't know where any of them are

3466
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:33,469
You don't know any of them are on the map. They're in mid. They're here. I think we win the trade

3467
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:36,590
We have two 20s. They're right here. Oh, they have two 20s now

3468
02:17:37,149 --> 02:17:40,430
I think they know we're going for it. Yeah, they're right beside. Yeah. All right, here we go

3469
02:17:44,909 --> 02:17:46,909
Watch out for the the collapse behind us

3470
02:17:47,149 --> 02:17:51,340
I'm gonna say let's just show that wait. We shouldn't back off too hard. Should we

3471
02:17:52,059 --> 02:17:57,180
No, we're just I mean if you see a fight get the play. Oh right there. They're right at fire giant. Yeah

3472
02:17:58,219 --> 02:18:02,459
I mean, I I don't mind going in an ulting. I don't care. Are they going for it?

3473
02:18:02,459 --> 02:18:06,139
You do you bro if you see it go for it. I mean they look they're thinking about it

3474
02:18:07,549 --> 02:18:08,989
Just like we are

3475
02:18:08,989 --> 02:18:14,059
We should just go around honestly. I can buy I could just buy I i'm I have enough to buy like all right

3476
02:18:14,059 --> 02:18:15,340
They're all in it

3481
02:18:31,809 --> 02:18:33,409
How about wards?

3482

Are they gonna get fire giant since we all back? Are we checking it? Someone check fire dragon? No one no one's

Stick together and push or how are we feeling?

We're gonna win. What do you mean at least?

3677
02:32:57,819 --> 02:33:02,379
I mean at the at the very end of the day. No matter what happens. We won a game

3678
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,540
Okay, germ

3679
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:10,590
Always a lot of damage. We did a lot. I think we could win the whole thing

3680
02:33:11,569 --> 02:33:12,530
Yeah

3681
02:33:12,530 --> 02:33:19,549
Player image wait, I only did 17k

3682
02:33:20,030 --> 02:33:25,659
18k player damage. I feel like that's not a lot. I mean compared to 40 and 30

3683
02:33:25,659 --> 02:33:28,219
No, but I mean you still did more damage than most the other team

3684
02:33:33,309 --> 02:33:42,639
I can see the chat again. Hold on. So i'm not doing my role, correct? Um, I really don't know

3685
02:33:44,559 --> 02:33:50,159
Uh coach is he doing all right? Yeah, where's our coach coach? Is he doing all right? Does he need a whipping?

3686
02:33:52,139 --> 02:33:57,200
I think coach might be afk

3687
02:34:02,110 --> 02:34:02,989
Be right back

3688
02:34:02,989 --> 02:34:06,780
I think we just got to be more assertive when we know we're stronger

3689
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:12,180
True

3690
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:14,420
I did do a lot of structure damage

3691
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:16,500
That's good. That's good. Lots of pushing

3692
02:34:17,139 --> 02:34:19,860
Yeah, my structure damage was 8 000. You guys were

3693
02:34:20,579 --> 02:34:21,620
a thousand

3694
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:25,170
and 200 300

3695
02:34:25,170 --> 02:34:27,170
Okay, so that was my role

3696
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:33,040
I didn't do a lot of structure damage or damage in general, but I did

3697
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:36,079
do some stunning

3698
02:34:36,659 --> 02:34:38,290
So

3699
02:34:38,290 --> 02:34:43,329
Yeah, I think what we also need to do is I also need to combine my alt because my alt is a silence

3700
02:34:43,969 --> 02:34:48,260
So if you pull them in and I silence them, they can't shrink it. Yeah

3701
02:34:50,180 --> 02:34:52,180
That's actually smart. Holy shit. Yeah

3702
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:56,270
So you want to know how to win the next game?

3703
02:34:56,739 --> 02:34:57,620
Yes

3704
02:34:57,620 --> 02:34:58,579
uh

3705
02:34:58,579 --> 02:35:04,579
Russell be like when you guys are grouping around the fire blink and just fucking just pull your dick out and slap them around

3706
02:35:04,899 --> 02:35:09,139
Like just go run at them that heard of anything. Okay. You know what what happened?

3707
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:23,950
Hey that herman miller chair sure is good, isn't it? I'm not I have I have shorts on okay

3708
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:30,750
I've got shorts on I've got shorts on I just i'm i'm a gamer

3709
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:48,739
I'm i'm i'm gaming i'm i'm intensely gaming

3710
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:06,829
I have to pee i'll be back

3711
02:36:06,829 --> 02:36:11,700
When you're low he can see you all the time. So that was fucking you even more. Oh

3712
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:20,479
That's how he alts you no matter what. Yep. I gotta pee. I'll be right back. Where's the picture of germa playing naked

3713
02:36:20,799 --> 02:36:22,799
You missed it. I put it up already

3714
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:30,370
Where if somebody will show you it's it's it's it's not even a big deal. I'll be right back first pick or not germa germa

3715
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:34,110
I'll be right back. No

3716
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:37,420
Pick shouldn't matter to be honest

3717
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:43,760
Okay, you all are just gonna take whatever you want and they're just gonna do the same thing

3718
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:51,620
He's playing naked you guys are second pick last game in the other games, right?

3719
02:36:52,979 --> 02:36:56,979
I feel like we all have to go naked. Yeah, I was gonna say like I feel like we have to take on more clothes

3720
02:36:57,379 --> 02:37:06,879
Oh, yeah, when you're in lane make sure you guys use your potions

3721
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:12,899
Like just if you're doing anything just pop them if you're at all low hp, you don't need to be super low

3722
02:37:18,959 --> 02:37:19,440
Wait, sorry

3723
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:22,079
What did you say? I zoned out for a second when when you're in lane

3724
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:26,239
Even if you're just a little low like say you're at 80% health, just use your potions. Make sure you're okay

3725
02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:30,719
It's okay. I'd rather you waste them than just die. The miss gift skin is so ugly

3726
02:37:32,159 --> 02:37:34,159
It's definitely an odd skin

3727
02:37:34,239 --> 02:37:37,280
I don't want to be me but it's it's scary as hell looking

3728
02:37:41,229 --> 02:37:43,229
Oh, yeah, no, there's no going

3729
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:43,950
Yeah

3730
02:37:43,950 --> 02:37:48,350
Um, you know your you when you buy buy the death toll first

3731
02:37:48,909 --> 02:37:55,950
Your second item it builds into that transcendence item. It's called morningstar. You want to buy like the tier one of that transcendence

3732
02:37:57,569 --> 02:38:02,770
Did I not do that? No, no, no you bought you almost bought nothing which would have fucking screwed you

3733
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:05,090
Really bad

3734
02:38:05,649 --> 02:38:11,329
Yeah, so buy the buy the death toll then buy that item then buy your potion and he's part about it

3735
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:16,129
Okay. Okay. No, go ahead. The purification beads shouldn't cost anything. They're free

3736
02:38:16,690 --> 02:38:19,170
Okay, so death toll how many potions?

3737
02:38:19,649 --> 02:38:22,370
Uh, it should be I think it's four or five

3738
02:38:22,770 --> 02:38:23,809
Yeah, it's five

3739
02:38:23,809 --> 02:38:29,409
Yeah, buy yeah buy the morningstar and then just buy the you max out five potions and that's fine. You can just buy

3740
02:38:29,489 --> 02:38:31,489
No, no, no, no buy death toll

3741
02:38:31,489 --> 02:38:33,010
Yeah, death toll

3742
02:38:33,010 --> 02:38:36,209
I can second item is called morningstar. It builds into the

3743
02:38:36,930 --> 02:38:42,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you the one's a starter and the other one is the tier one of your transcendence item

3744
02:38:43,969 --> 02:38:45,569
Are you eating?

3745
02:38:45,569 --> 02:38:47,569
Yeah, some garlic

3746
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:49,649
Oh my bad

02:38:49,649 --> 02:38:51,649
I did it. I pulled a germa. What'd you say?

3748
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:54,850
I said what am I someone asked what I was eating because I was eating

3749
02:38:55,729 --> 02:39:00,690
I was about to tell them but then I hotmicked. Oh, are you eating? Can you tell me now?

Almonds, yeah garlic rosemary almonds interesting

3751
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:11,969
Late game you're super tanky too. You can just run into phoenixes and shit like don't like yeah

3752
02:39:11,969 --> 02:39:15,889
That's what I was 10 minutes, but you can take them for a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was saying. Um

3753
02:39:16,530 --> 02:39:20,690
Whenever we were like chilling at the phoenix like I could tank it a little bit until the minions come well, russell

3754
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:24,610
When you know, we're stronger you can just fucking go into the enemy team

3755
02:39:25,809 --> 02:39:28,049
Yeah after 30 minutes to that fire giant

3756
02:39:28,049 --> 02:39:31,649
It'll make it so you kill the phoenixes instantly like you just all do it once it'll die

3757
02:39:32,209 --> 02:39:36,690
Oh cool. If you have a purple fire giant on your buff bar, you'll just kill everything

3758
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:56,270
You guys see the earn free rewards thing in game, yeah watch ads bro, that's cool. We have to watch ads

Who's the one making the videos the guys?

3790
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:13,950
Oh, no, you're talking about germa from 10 years ago. He was like way smarter than I am

3791
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:16,899
Wait, what happened?

3792
02:42:16,899 --> 02:42:20,739
No, because i'm over here asking questions and shit, but I was like, ah, we don't have a coach but this guy

3793
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:24,420
I can just ask him

3794
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:26,420
Yeah, we got a coach

3795
02:42:27,889 --> 02:42:30,610
What happened to your intelligence germa? It's me. I'm the coach

3796
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:33,250
I got over 35 years old

3797
02:42:33,649 --> 02:42:37,069
So you're regressing

3798
02:42:37,069 --> 02:42:39,069
I mean 29 when you get older, man

3799
02:42:39,309 --> 02:42:41,309
What's it like at 35?

3800
02:42:42,079 --> 02:42:44,479
Yo, go look at the characters right now gods

Yeah, look at look at vanima and look at his third skin. Oh, yeah

3802
02:42:57,819 --> 02:43:01,180
That skin is as old as time bro. That is really old, isn't it?

3803
02:43:01,739 --> 02:43:12,459
That's the skin everyone used to wear well the thing I kind of had to prove it today because

3804
02:43:13,379 --> 02:43:15,139
I always talk about how I don't

3805
02:43:15,139 --> 02:43:17,459
I I don't really wear that many clothes when i'm sitting around

3806
02:43:17,780 --> 02:43:19,860
Sometimes it'd be a pair of shorts or whatever, right?

3807
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:24,139
And people think i'm full of shit when I say that usually when i'm sitting here streaming

3808
02:43:24,219 --> 02:43:29,659
I just I kind of don't really have any clothes on so you're a forever nude. No, no, where are you partial?

3809
02:43:30,459 --> 02:43:33,020
Las vegas, man. Oh

3810
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:37,260
It's it's 120 degrees out. Isn't that what ac is for?

3811
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:46,190
Yeah, I have ac but leave your car parked outside right because your tires remote. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No

3812
02:43:48,799 --> 02:44:00,299
I'm a forever clothed. Wait, why do people believe in team tecton that went over team germa? I don't know

3813
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:08,819
Wait, they've been playing for that long. Yeah tectons. I think only been playing smite for the past week like that's it

3814
02:44:09,459 --> 02:44:13,540
They've been playing they've been playing a lot though. Haven't they put them in my lane? Yeah, but tecton

3815
02:44:14,270 --> 02:44:18,750
They beat mendo's team the one you guys just lost to they like slaughtered them. Wait, what?

3816
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:28,670
Wait, what you guys are much better now. You're better now that is lose the second game. Are we out? Yes

3817
02:44:28,989 --> 02:44:31,360
Okay. Well, i'll see you guys later then

3818
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:37,840
Huh? No, we win. We win. We win. We win. What's with all these quitters on my team, man? No, I don't understand

3819
02:44:38,239 --> 02:44:41,180
Sure for it, dude

3820
02:44:42,139 --> 02:44:46,299
No, we don't just have sure for we have sure for we have germa we have noko we have russell

3821
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:50,430
We have pokey walls. We have weakened. We're gonna win. I think we got

3822
02:44:51,709 --> 02:44:54,829
That is actually all we have. Yeah. Yeah, that is it exactly

3823
02:44:56,690 --> 02:45:01,489
So if we lose this then we watch the rest of the tournament. Oh, it's for who to watch not who to win

3824
02:45:01,649 --> 02:45:04,770
Oh, never think i'm gonna watch the rest of the tournament. We're gonna win this for who to win

3825
02:45:07,729 --> 02:45:13,659
Did they spectate our game once or no? I think what about the slipknot stuff? Yeah, the slipknot stuff is um,

3826
02:45:14,139 --> 02:45:23,180
I think this game is gonna be interesting. There's channel though on the stream. Poseidon is a lot of it, right?

3827
02:45:24,299 --> 02:45:30,940
If I lose this game, i'm going to apex and soloqueue ranked and getting depression same here. We're not gonna lose

3828
02:45:31,020 --> 02:45:34,139
We're not gonna lose. That's the thing. I'm literally the plat gatekeeper

3829
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:39,469
I fell out of pred i'm dog shit. No

3830
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:46,190
I'm perpetually diamond one. No d4 plat one d4 plat one d4 plat one

3831
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:48,989
Apparently they watched the end of your last game too, so they get to see bop

3832
02:45:49,629 --> 02:45:52,940
Nice

3833
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:59,020
Should I be the stranger things monster for this one? Are we uh, did it did it when are we starting?

3834
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:05,819
I switch my characters take too much working. Whatever you want bro. Don't let your memes be dreams. No, honestly

3835
02:46:06,139 --> 02:46:08,139
No other character better than you should just stay

3836
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:15,540
There's gonna be different animations for the new skins and stuff. Now i'm staying with the metal one. That'll fuck with me

3837
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:27,489
All right, I think we should just win. Yeah. Yeah, we should that sounds like a good idea just win forehead

3838
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:31,250
Okay, so let's do that then I think we have a pretty decent chance

3839
02:46:32,239 --> 02:46:38,399
To just win forehead. Okay. Whoa, wait, we're all playing the same characters. Okay

3840
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:42,799
So russia you go in your ultimate is a pull

3841
02:46:43,360 --> 02:46:44,559
Yeah, it's like well

3842
02:46:44,559 --> 02:46:49,040
It's like you started off and I have to get them in the circle and then like the pool takes like I think

3843
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:52,479
Four seconds or three seconds or something. It's one of the easiest ults in the game to beads

3844
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:54,159
Yeah

3845
02:46:54,159 --> 02:46:56,799
That's the biggest problem like I can say i'm gonna pull them

3846
02:46:56,799 --> 02:47:01,360
But if they beads it I don't pull them you actually got two double kills because they beads it too early

3847
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:04,319
Yeah, did they really

3848
02:47:04,559 --> 02:47:09,739
Yeah, you did. That's kind of sad. Wait, how do how do they beads it too early?

3849
02:47:09,899 --> 02:47:15,020
If you if you beads it before it actually pulls it will like it'll still pull them if you beat it like way

3850
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:16,379
Or like it fell

3851
02:47:16,379 --> 02:47:20,129
Yeah, the whole thing you're falling off the beads are falling off. Okay interesting

3852
02:47:20,610 --> 02:47:21,809
so

3853
02:47:21,809 --> 02:47:27,659
You pull and then sure forwards your ulti dragging in a line that does a bunch of damage

3854
02:47:28,219 --> 02:47:30,850
Okay over issues right now

3855
02:47:31,090 --> 02:47:32,610
I'm just trying to figure out right now

3856
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:35,969
What i'm trying to figure out is a combination kind of like overwatch, right?

3857
02:47:35,969 --> 02:47:41,489
We're like zarya hanzo like so you pull and then I ult because my ult does damage and it silences

3858
02:47:41,809 --> 02:47:47,069
So they can't beads or anything and then you you dragon. Are you talking to me? Because I zoned out

3859
02:47:50,959 --> 02:47:52,959
You need to get your head in the game

3860
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:59,569
What did you say

3861
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:02,530
You don't even remember what you said bro

3862
02:48:05,809 --> 02:48:07,969
This is where we go five winstons in the middle, yeah

3863
02:48:09,409 --> 02:48:16,719
Okay

3864
02:48:16,719 --> 02:48:22,319
What oh boy, what the heck you pull pull I ult he dragons

3865
02:48:23,969 --> 02:48:29,969
Yeah, wait if you silence your ult silences, right? Yes my ult silences so I can silence into the

3866
02:48:30,209 --> 02:48:35,409
Wait, that means they can't beads right? Yeah, no, they can I think you can still beads when you're silenced

3867
02:48:36,909 --> 02:48:38,909
Yeah, that's just stupid. What's the point of silencing?

3868
02:48:39,549 --> 02:48:44,670
So you can't use abilities because they're not you you don't use them all together usually like if they get pulled drop your shit

3869
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:48,030
Where they get pulled but you're kind of using them separately to make them beads

3870
02:48:48,590 --> 02:48:50,590
So one of your all shit is

3871
02:48:50,909 --> 02:48:54,670
Wait, that makes sense. Yeah, you can beads while you're silenced right somebody's saying that

3872
02:48:55,629 --> 02:48:56,510
Yeah

3873
02:48:56,510 --> 02:49:02,590
The order that you sent me, uh, we can is that the order that I build in? Yes, exactly. Okay. All right

3874
02:49:09,700 --> 02:49:11,700
Tyrus servers getting ddos right now

3875
02:49:13,219 --> 02:49:19,620
I don't think they're getting ddos. Maybe there's so many people playing right now that I think they they're fixing them. They just reset

3876
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:23,979
Is this normal in spite? Yes

3877
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:26,540
Every night while i'm streaming it up

3878
02:49:28,139 --> 02:49:33,500
Every night. Yeah ever since like uh, like coven when everyone started playing like smite's player base double

3879
02:49:33,579 --> 02:49:38,940
They I think it's a code problem with their logins and they can't even fix it. Oh spaghetti code. Yep

3880
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:42,610
Because the games don't crash like if i'm in a game i'm fine

3881
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:47,649
I'm not in a booster seat. I'm not in a booster seat in the picture. I have that's a herman miller

3882
02:49:48,290 --> 02:49:51,010
Embodied chair and it's fucking phenomenal. Okay

3883
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,360
Everyone's saying i'm in a booster seat. No, that's that's i'm in that's a herman miller

3884
02:49:57,860 --> 02:50:01,139
Well, we can't tell because there's a giant black box by herman miller

3885
02:50:02,049 --> 02:50:06,930
Uh, no, they gave me the chair, but those chairs suck. I like the embody

3886
02:50:08,290 --> 02:50:09,649
Those chairs suck

3887
02:50:09,649 --> 02:50:13,250
Why are you saying that have you sat in one arm rests their arm rests are doggers

3888
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:20,639
I like the aaron arm rests more than I like the embodies because the aaron has like that cushion that little squishy squishy

3889
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:24,959
I I I think the doesn't I like the the back crank the thing where you go like

3890
02:50:26,159 --> 02:50:29,840
And maybe tighter. Yeah. No, I love it. That was asmr spark

3891
02:50:30,799 --> 02:50:33,680
No, I love it. I think it's great. Yeah, but can anyone purr?

3892
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:37,420
I don't think anyone's gonna want to do that

3893
02:50:37,979 --> 02:50:39,979
I

3894
02:50:40,219 --> 02:50:43,100
I'm not sure anybody's gonna want to do those sounds

3895
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:48,750
We should try joining now apparently are we all right? We can do it. Yeah

3896
02:50:49,489 --> 02:50:55,149
All right. So we're let's go for it. All right play are you guys ready?

3897
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:58,420

What who's uh, I just had an oreo milkshake whose game we trying to be joining. Thanks for the reminder

3899
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:10,079

3900
02:51:15,659 --> 02:51:17,659

02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:36,899
Where's russell?

3906
02:51:36,899 --> 02:51:39,459

Never heard that before. Yeah. Yeah, I don't I wouldn't say yoked up. I'd say more

3909
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:51,069
Like cottage cheesed up

3910
02:51:54,909 --> 02:51:56,670
I didn't see any drooping

3911
02:51:56,670 --> 02:52:06,690
I'm sitting in a chair. Yeah, but you know, like old people have like their skin starts sagging. I got pretty good posture to anything

3912
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:15,069
I'd have to relook

3913
02:52:15,069 --> 02:52:16,670
What's wrong with you?

3914
02:52:16,670 --> 02:52:24,959
But I don't know where to start deep right now two green teas. I'm too

3915
02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:29,680
Are you actually oh my god, see you gotta slow down

3916
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:32,340
I just ate this oreo milkshake. It was delicious

3917
02:52:33,579 --> 02:52:38,219
Yeah, now you're gonna get the sugar rush lord knows I need that

3918
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:41,899
Should I get another green tea? Should we go three green teas for three matches? What do you have?

I can get yoked up bro. Try get fucking should I get fucking cheddar cheesed up? Get juiced up, bro

3920
02:52:47,819 --> 02:52:49,819
German starts calming everything

3921
02:52:53,659 --> 02:52:56,159
How do you fall asleep, uh

3922
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,200
Like do you like sleep with the tv on?

3923
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:03,920
Yeah, usually ipad I have an ipad on my chest and I just kind of watch whatever and then fall asleep

3924
02:53:05,979 --> 02:53:08,450
Really? Yeah

3925
02:53:08,450 --> 02:53:10,850
Let's say when he walks in the room. Just find you like they can wake you up

3926
02:53:10,850 --> 02:53:12,049
He has an ipad right in your chest

3927
02:53:12,049 --> 02:53:15,659
Yeah, I mean that you think that picture was weird this pictures of me

3928
02:53:15,899 --> 02:53:20,239
I'll sleep with just random videos of the shit that we've shown. All right, I think we're good to go

3929
02:53:20,239 --> 02:53:25,739
But where where is the match? Are they trying to get you guys to make oh are we making the game?

3930
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:33,979
We're supposed to be second pick so I don't know why you'd be making the game unless I don't see their name

3931
02:53:36,190 --> 02:53:39,420
I see I see. I remember this game. It's uh stripping is the host

3932
02:53:39,899 --> 02:53:43,090
Okay, so it's stripping is that the same password?

3933
02:53:44,209 --> 02:53:45,809
Wait stripping's playing

3934
02:53:45,809 --> 02:53:51,329
Yeah, I love stripping stripping's on ticktones too. Yeah, I love stripping too. He dropped the password in the chat. Yeah

3935
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:56,430
All right, we're going to kill him though. Can you read that password out loud for me?

3936
02:53:57,459 --> 02:53:59,950
um, yeah, um

3937
02:54:00,430 --> 02:54:04,829
Uh, I'm trying to think of something funny to say but I don't I don't want to even be somewhat similar

3938
02:54:05,389 --> 02:54:10,829
You know, I guess the password like 12 years ago to like a league of legends tournament that was streamed

3939
02:54:11,950 --> 02:54:16,829
yeah, I was like tsm versus clg and I I got in it was like a random like a

3940
02:54:17,549 --> 02:54:21,790
Alienware tournament and I got in and they didn't kick me out and I played I I cannot join

3941
02:54:22,590 --> 02:54:29,540
I cannot join that game. By the way, did you play for I think clg and I went against tsm. Yeah

3942
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:35,219
No one on clg went like hey, that's not our player bruce

3943
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:37,700
When I do password and hit go

3944
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:44,420
They didn't give a fuck but I just you might need a relog or remake your party remake the party

3945
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:50,659
All right restart the game

3946
02:54:50,739 --> 02:55:02,639
There's a black screen here. I'm sorry. I don't forgive you. I do. I hope you did. You're welcome

3947
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:06,700
I just saw the germ of picture

3948
02:55:06,940 --> 02:55:08,940
You sleeping to xcc?

3949
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:10,459

02:55:10,459 --> 02:55:13,340
That's not edited by the way, I actually was watching that

02:55:14,239 --> 02:55:16,239
Did you post in the chat? Okay

3952
02:55:16,559 --> 02:55:18,559
Wait, wait. Oh my god

3953
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:23,180
That's how exactly how I imagined you would look like

3954
02:55:25,170 --> 02:55:31,489
Like what do you mean? Like like sleeping with uh, I guess a computer like a computer like on your on your chest

3955
02:55:31,809 --> 02:55:35,010
Is that the juicer? I thought it would fall over though

3956
02:55:36,319 --> 02:55:40,959
You just because you stay completely still I get I must I just I just like do like I could do like a corpse

3957
02:55:40,959 --> 02:55:42,959
And just don't move. That's kind of weird

3958
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:46,079
I don't know this dude. You love some gambas streams, bro

3959
02:55:46,079 --> 02:55:49,520

3961
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:59,979
Good. That's what we like to hear. No wonder you're always juiced up on green tea

My games with that

3965
02:56:13,360 --> 02:56:15,600
What is that you should play games with the juicer?

3966
02:56:16,819 --> 02:56:18,979
I would but

02:56:18,979 --> 02:56:24,860
Loaded in busy guy. I'll get it happening. I'll get my guy to talk to my guy

Pending party invite no code. Do you have a bidet? I don't have a bidet yet. Oh just shut on them

4020
03:00:29,440 --> 03:00:35,299

4021
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:36,659
What?

4022
03:00:36,659 --> 03:00:38,020
Why?

4023
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:41,860
Why am I not seeing your invite man? It says you have a pending invite from somebody

4024
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:45,040

4025
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,760

All right, I'm joining join offer. That was weird. It's a black screen. Uh, yeah

4028
03:00:57,069 --> 03:01:01,489
It's got to stay that way for a little bit. All right new uh new lobbies up. We're good

4029
03:01:02,610 --> 03:01:08,459
We're not good. No, cuz I hear this tournament relies on us right now. We need to stall forever

4030
03:01:10,860 --> 03:01:19,969
All right. I'm reading power of god right now. Okay. Um, here we go. Does it work password is

4031
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:22,989
bacon and

4032
03:01:23,069 --> 03:01:25,629
Eggs, dude, you're muted. You're not muted

4033
03:01:28,379 --> 03:01:40,590
All right, we're in all right. I'm gonna take this opportunity to get maybe one half green tea

4034
03:01:42,049 --> 03:01:48,850
I'll be right back. Yeah, half with with sugar sugar spice and everything nice, dude

4035
03:01:48,930 --> 03:01:54,659
There's no green tea. He's just taking a massive bong hit. That's the poke method

4036
03:01:59,790 --> 03:02:01,790
Jerma smokes bongs

4037
03:02:02,030 --> 03:02:17,520
Would you believe it? Okay, everyone muted dude. I always I keep zoning out. I don't know why yeah, because i'm not jerma

4038
03:02:19,010 --> 03:02:22,930
Yeah, that's exactly it actually poke. I hate hearing your fucking voice. You're so stupid

4039
03:02:23,329 --> 03:02:26,610
And honestly, i'm gonna punch you in your face next time I see you. Is that what you wanted to hear?

4040
03:02:26,690 --> 03:02:30,290
You can't even reach me bro taller than your ass. Okay, that was kind of weird

4041
03:02:30,850 --> 03:02:35,180
That was actually really rude. Well, he's not here. You're gonna physically hurt me

4042
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:40,739
I'd say you will be hurt. Did I say that? I don't think I said you will be hurt

4043
03:02:40,899 --> 03:02:49,139
You said you're gonna punch me dude. You're acting crazy. I'm twitch reporting you partner on partner. That's fucked up

4044
03:02:49,700 --> 03:03:00,180
I got you chill chill. Okay, let's do this, baby. I just searched. Yeah

4045
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:09,700
That first character they picked has a bit of alt that sucks you into them

4046
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:12,420
Um, and then two damaging abilities and a root

4047
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:20,020
He's all ranged. It's mad. I mean all those guys i'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm here seem like they play smile. I'm good. I'm good

4048
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:27,100
I had to cut my poop short

4049
03:03:27,739 --> 03:03:30,860
No, i'm good. Huh? I fucking I'm

4050
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:33,260
Did you still have some inside of you or something?

4051
03:03:33,819 --> 03:03:39,899
Yes, I I popped the stream open. I was like, I wonder if we're gonna start soon and I fucking I knew how to pick

4052
03:03:41,579 --> 03:03:44,219
Why don't you just that's the type of player we like

4053
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:47,100
Now i'm gonna play insane because I need to poop

4054
03:03:47,819 --> 03:03:49,420
Wait, you didn't poop

4055
03:03:49,420 --> 03:03:55,579
I like half poop. Hey, honestly man. This is uh, this is a hundred thousand dollar tournament just shit in your pants

4056
03:03:55,659 --> 03:03:58,579
You can buy a new fucking pair of pants

4057
03:03:58,579 --> 03:04:01,739
That's a good point

4058
03:04:01,739 --> 03:04:06,780
Like if if we're in the middle of the last team fight and we might win the tournament you could buy a new rug myself

4059
03:04:08,079 --> 03:04:10,159
Who's better here uler or artemis?

4060
03:04:11,299 --> 03:04:17,540
I mean, you're better with artemis as well. You don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you're warmed. You're warmed

4061
03:04:21,409 --> 03:04:22,770
You don't know that

4062
03:04:22,770 --> 03:04:25,500
This guy's turtle heading bro

4063
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:27,500
And there's a turtle on the other team. Ew

4064
03:04:27,819 --> 03:04:29,819
Dude, I see

4065
03:04:30,940 --> 03:04:33,020
You would genuinely play better if you just let it all go

4066
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:36,670
Is that just me

4067
03:04:37,309 --> 03:04:44,430
Like you were saying earlier kali jungle. Yeah, but but that's for peeing for pooping. It's different like you're

4068
03:04:45,069 --> 03:04:47,069
You keister that you're not gonna feel good

4069
03:04:50,219 --> 03:04:52,299
Is this uh, if we lose how many more games we have?

4070
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:55,180
This is the last one

4071
03:04:55,899 --> 03:05:00,139
You win you keep going. I think if you lose you're done, but there's no like website or anything to check

4072
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:04,059
Is uh, I guess anybody out already or two in one win?

4073
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:08,690
I think you go to semis and then the winner that goes to finals

4074
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:18,719
All right, how many teams even are in this tournament? Yeah, is anybody out already or I don't I don't I'm sure somebody is

4075
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:23,680
I think there's four no. Well, if someone's oh and two they have to be out of four. There's two groups of four

4076
03:05:24,239 --> 03:05:30,799
And there's four people per group

4077
03:05:30,799 --> 03:05:37,920
Yep, so if we come in like fourth or fifth place, that means we get we still we're still um able to get maybe like

4078
03:05:38,559 --> 03:05:41,329
three to four dollars each, right?

4079
03:05:41,329 --> 03:06:06,639
Oh

4080
03:06:06,639 --> 03:06:10,079
What are you just beat is oh and two so they're done and snuffy's team is done

4081
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:13,659
What is baron's

4082
03:06:13,659 --> 03:06:15,579
other abilities beside his ult

4083
03:06:15,579 --> 03:06:19,979
Uh, his two is a circle and if it hits on you it will heal his team and does damage to you

4084
03:06:20,459 --> 03:06:25,819
Is one is like a crisscross line ability that does damage and then his three he throws it out if it hits you

4085
03:06:25,819 --> 03:06:27,899
It sticks to you and slows you and then roots you up for a second

4086
03:06:29,020 --> 03:06:31,020
Who am I playing against collie?

4087
03:06:31,100 --> 03:06:33,100
You're gonna be against that bear in the top guy

4088
03:06:33,899 --> 03:06:37,420
Is he what is oh that's which that or you're gonna be against the turtle

4089
03:06:37,899 --> 03:06:43,979
One of the other which one's what does he do to bite it? So if the the top guy's a mate or the bottom guy

4090
03:06:44,219 --> 03:06:49,500
There and he's a mage. Um, like I said, he suck you in results. He has damaging abilities and he has a root

4091
03:06:49,819 --> 03:06:53,180
Um, he doesn't have any movement though. Like he can't like blink away or anything like that

4092
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:57,100
Yeah, the turtle has a dash and if he hits you he can push you

4093
03:06:57,420 --> 03:07:02,139
His ultimate will knock you up a bunch of times and then he has a little turtle he can throw you

4094
03:07:02,860 --> 03:07:07,659
And he has an ability that will make him glow and if he glows he reflects damage like if you auto him

4095
03:07:07,659 --> 03:07:11,899
It'll reflect damage. Oh, so I shouldn't hit him when he glows. Yeah, it also lowers his cooldown. All right

4096
03:07:11,899 --> 03:07:13,899
I gotta go. Good luck boys. Good luck

4097
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:17,260
Oh, let's do it. What do you mean? Good luck. We need the luck not him

4098
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:23,340
Well, he has to watch us. Oh, that's true. I think we're gonna we're in a good position here. I think

4099
03:07:24,299 --> 03:07:29,260
Why is everyone's like border so cool? I'm nervous because they play the character a lot

4100
03:07:30,219 --> 03:07:32,940
That guy has 2016 smite what

4101
03:07:33,979 --> 03:07:37,340
I have beta tester bro. Oh, never mind. We're chilling. Yeah

4102
03:07:38,299 --> 03:07:40,299
I was actually in the alpha of this game

4103
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:44,940
Is that legit or are you just saying that it's like a legitimately different game now?

4104
03:07:46,219 --> 03:07:48,219
This is unfair matchmaking

4105
03:07:49,250 --> 03:07:53,090
Yeah, they couldn't change the teams because why don't we just have germa play anubis?

4106
03:07:54,049 --> 03:07:58,049
I mean, I I have a diamond level 10 anubis. I'm surprised

4107
03:07:59,299 --> 03:08:00,180
So

4108
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:03,780
I've had that that's not I didn't make a joke or anything. What did I say? That was funny. No, I know

4109
03:08:04,739 --> 03:08:06,579
it's just

4110
03:08:06,579 --> 03:08:10,739
It was diamond level 10 anubis. Like the game would have been over if I was on anubis

4111
03:08:10,819 --> 03:08:12,819
I just don't understand why that's a funny joke. That's

4112
03:08:13,379 --> 03:08:15,379
That's not it. I wasn't trying to be funny

4113
03:08:16,979 --> 03:08:21,139
Sometimes that's the best way to be funny isn't it when you're not even trying to it is mildly funny

4114
03:08:21,219 --> 03:08:23,780
Especially since sure for is laughing. It does make me want to laugh

4115
03:08:24,659 --> 03:08:29,620
See see sure for does have a contagious laugh. Thank you. I'll let everyone laugh. I'm smiling

4116
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:34,120
Hey, by the way, I went I I practiced yesterday in the afternoon with anubis

4117
03:08:34,879 --> 03:08:40,159
And just like oh just in case maybe I might play it didn't know what I had no idea what the setup was going to be

4118
03:08:40,719 --> 03:08:43,600
Um, I didn't land one mummify in five games

4119
03:08:44,399 --> 03:08:48,479
Oh, it was awful. So I was like, oh shit. Hopefully I don't have to play this character

4120
03:08:49,489 --> 03:08:51,489
Well, I guess it worked out

4121
03:08:51,489 --> 03:08:55,889
Yeah, wait, he said buy deaths deaths embraces something else that's toll

4122
03:08:57,010 --> 03:09:02,690
And transcend death's toll. He has it. He has it in the discord. It's death's toll and morningstar morningstar. That's what it was

4123
03:09:03,489 --> 03:09:05,489
Oh, yeah, you and folk have the same build

4124
03:09:07,819 --> 03:09:09,760
All right, you guys ready?

4125
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:10,719
my

4126
03:09:10,719 --> 03:09:14,780

4290
03:21:54,719 --> 03:21:56,719
It's gonna do a lot of damage

4291
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:07,440

03:34:17,010 --> 03:34:23,379
His all makes so he can't die. Well, he has turned to mirror all in that all

4445
03:34:24,959 --> 03:34:27,200
So if we don't have a stun or something they can just run

4446
03:34:29,219 --> 03:34:32,020
Yeah, they're all hanging out here. No, it was alt for alt. Yeah

4447
03:34:33,459 --> 03:34:35,620
I think they I think they want to do pyro

4448
03:34:38,190 --> 03:34:40,190
There watch out baron baron baron baron's right here

4449
03:34:41,229 --> 03:34:45,200
Coming they're coming in. Oh fuck

4450
03:34:46,299 --> 03:34:51,170
22 seconds to my ult

4451
03:34:51,170 --> 03:34:53,170
Oh, that sucked. I'm here. I'm here

4452
03:34:53,809 --> 03:34:55,809
I could be that I got fucking destroyed

4453
03:34:56,450 --> 03:34:59,260
God damn it

4454
03:35:00,770 --> 03:35:02,770
Yeah, I tried to flash away

4455
03:35:02,770 --> 03:35:04,770
Oh my god, I died so fast

4456
03:35:05,569 --> 03:35:08,850
I got picked by the turtle. I couldn't move and I got melted

4457
03:35:09,889 --> 03:35:12,510
I don't even know what happened to me

4458
03:35:17,200 --> 03:35:24,850
They were getting noob stomped by a kali right now for two weeks and the team was announced like what a week ago cheaters confirmed

4459
03:35:25,329 --> 03:35:29,620
Before I don't want to buy

4460
03:35:29,620 --> 03:35:31,620
Fuck me

4461
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:39,219
I mean it's it ain't over. I mean we're down we're behind like this before

4462
03:35:39,780 --> 03:35:44,430
We did come back we have we still want to get money, yep

4463
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:55,600
They're all level 20 and we're not even close

4464
03:35:56,159 --> 03:36:01,280
What we need to do is one win one team fight

4465
03:36:01,920 --> 03:36:04,639
Yeah, that's all matter. It's like an hour fun for an hour. We good

4466
03:36:05,440 --> 03:36:08,239
Just farm for an hour under towers. You can just enter towers

4467
03:36:10,299 --> 03:36:13,659
Yeah, the fire giant really was a was a big a big negative

4468
03:36:16,579 --> 03:36:18,579
We lost our momentum after the fire giant

4469
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:25,340
Imagine if we got it farm for an hour

4470
03:36:26,620 --> 03:36:27,979
What is this thing?

4471
03:36:27,979 --> 03:36:39,200
I didn't buy awards

4472
03:36:39,200 --> 03:36:41,340
They're in mid right now

4473
03:36:41,340 --> 03:36:43,340
Three minutes take this gold fury

4474
03:36:44,750 --> 03:36:49,309
Mid yeah, they kill mid three in mid right now. I'm pushing it. I'm pushing it four in mid right now

4475
03:36:49,469 --> 03:36:51,469
They're in the tower right now

4476
03:36:52,350 --> 03:36:54,350
We met just four they're all here

4477
03:36:55,389 --> 03:36:57,389
Every single person's here. They destroyed the tower

4478
03:36:58,750 --> 03:37:00,750
They're coming in. They're coming into the jungle coming to the jungle

4479
03:37:01,620 --> 03:37:06,719
I'm here. I'm here. I'm pulling them from the jungle one on me. Fuck it. I'm taking them

4480
03:37:08,239 --> 03:37:12,510
I'm died

4481
03:37:12,510 --> 03:37:14,989
Holy fuck cali can't die in a roll. So

4482
03:37:18,270 --> 03:37:20,350
Holy shit, what's going on fair match making out there?

4483
03:37:21,469 --> 03:37:22,750
ggs

4484
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:26,350
Oh, it's not over yet. It's not over. It's not over. I don't know. I'm just i'm just uh

4485
03:37:27,229 --> 03:37:37,139
Just saying things

4486
03:37:37,139 --> 03:37:47,219
I gotta heal same i'm so close

4487
03:37:54,379 --> 03:37:58,940
Once we get even in gold and xp, we have a better team fight than them

4488
03:38:00,940 --> 03:38:04,139
Yeah, they're mid gold the gold series is just gold right nice luck. Yeah, we're better

4489
03:38:05,149 --> 03:38:07,149
i'm just gonna wait for my item then because

4490
03:38:07,229 --> 03:38:10,370
What else am I gonna do at this point?

4491
03:38:10,370 --> 03:38:12,370
I got I need eight gold

4492
03:38:13,010 --> 03:38:14,530
Collapse kevin

4493
03:38:14,530 --> 03:38:17,809
So that's what I just said. We just sit under tower and fucking

4494
03:38:22,340 --> 03:38:25,379
We just have to kite them or wait for big air results

4495
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:31,940
Because if you forced too much the colleagues just gonna press r and not that

4496
03:38:36,159 --> 03:38:38,159
Russell you're gonna make the game when you play russell

4497
03:38:39,040 --> 03:38:41,040
I am going to try my best

4498
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:46,510
Tried to eat that guy, but it didn't work trying to catch up in levels and xp

4499
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:55,700
All right. Let's uh, let's group up somewhere

4500
03:38:56,979 --> 03:39:00,020
They're they're they're right here. I'll get the buff here. They're all right here

4501
03:39:01,700 --> 03:39:05,680
Oh fuck

4502
03:39:05,680 --> 03:39:10,159
I'm like holy shit that her fucking hurts. I'm out. I think we should be trying to run

4503
03:39:13,629 --> 03:39:15,629
I

4504
03:39:19,069 --> 03:39:21,069
If we die here it's over

4505
03:39:25,069 --> 03:39:27,069
If we die here it's over

4506
03:39:32,739 --> 03:39:43,120
I mean I can wave clear fuck they're in mid right now three in mid

4507
03:39:46,590 --> 03:39:48,590
I have all

4508
03:39:56,059 --> 03:40:00,780
I have good wave clear so they can't push too much. It's gonna be hard for them to get into the phoenix air

4509
03:40:01,579 --> 03:40:04,059
They're all going left though. They're probably gonna get that left tower

4510
03:40:04,780 --> 03:40:15,200
I'm up in four. I'm with you sure for

4511
03:40:15,920 --> 03:40:20,989
Yeah, they're on left

4512
03:40:20,989 --> 03:40:23,389
What the fuck they got that siege tower, too

4513
03:40:24,270 --> 03:40:29,899
Okay, they all use their fucking

4514
03:40:30,530 --> 03:40:32,850
Thing anybody low are they low these beads?

4515
03:40:33,489 --> 03:40:35,280
No beads

4516
03:40:35,280 --> 03:40:38,399
I could jump on top right now and just say fuck it. Whatever. I'm gonna hit the trebuchet

4517
03:40:43,090 --> 03:40:45,090
My ult's up in 42 seconds

4518
03:40:45,250 --> 03:40:47,250
Two of them use their their beads

4519
03:40:48,639 --> 03:40:50,879
Don't push up too hard because I don't know where they are. I don't need

4520
03:40:53,459 --> 03:40:59,020
All right, I got full stack here. It's a lot of them don't have beads anymore. That'll be good for the next fight

4521
03:41:01,069 --> 03:41:02,590
Oh, I didn't want that

4522
03:41:02,590 --> 03:41:06,190
Are they uh, they're not doing fire turn or anything. They're doing they're doing it go go go go go go go

4523
03:41:06,190 --> 03:41:08,190
This is where we do it. Oh, that's bad

4524
03:41:10,319 --> 03:41:12,319
Don't die now

4525
03:41:18,239 --> 03:41:23,200
We just wait this out then that was the chance I went in like I actually caught some they're also low

4526
03:41:23,840 --> 03:41:25,840
I wasn't there

4527
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:27,840
We were all we were all just barely out

4528
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:34,799
Honestly, I'm pretty tall we may have uh, we may have gotten in

4529
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:38,799
It's possible. We would have gotten in and killed somebody but if they killed devire giant we're all

4530
03:41:41,920 --> 03:41:44,159
Yeah, which is really fine. Yeah. Yeah

4531
03:41:45,440 --> 03:41:47,440
So we just have to play slow again

4532
03:41:48,180 --> 03:41:50,479
They're all up here

4533
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:54,239
At least one of them i'm going to buy i'm gonna go buy real quick might as well

4534
03:41:54,559 --> 03:41:59,680
Yeah, go finish your bills if you have I think everybody just go buy. Yeah, i'm buying words to finish your bills if you have any

4535
03:42:00,319 --> 03:42:07,020
We need a water jungle really bad

4536
03:42:07,579 --> 03:42:09,440
You're dead

4537
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:11,360
Oh my god, I am

4538
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:12,559
Yeah

4539
03:42:12,559 --> 03:42:14,879
We have to play by the tier threes. Sorry

4540
03:42:16,239 --> 03:42:23,729
Yeah, I mean at least my death isn't that bad

4541
03:42:24,129 --> 03:42:26,049
No, it is pretty bad

4542
03:42:26,049 --> 03:42:28,049
They can yeah, because they're on an initiator

4543
03:42:28,450 --> 03:42:32,979
Yeah, okay

4544
03:42:32,979 --> 03:42:35,540
I think they're I think they're gonna go for it here

4545
03:42:36,340 --> 03:42:42,340
Oh, yeah, they are. Yep. I'm dead. They're just fucking aping me. Yeah

4546
03:42:42,979 --> 03:42:44,979
Sorry guys

4547
03:42:48,159 --> 03:42:50,159
No, the sander tower sander tower

4548
03:42:58,139 --> 03:43:01,020
Yeah, kali's invincible with the owner

4549
03:43:01,979 --> 03:43:03,979
Yep, she's a noob stomper

4550
03:43:11,809 --> 03:43:14,110
They're hacking

4551
03:43:14,110 --> 03:43:15,790
That was so hard

4552
03:43:15,790 --> 03:43:16,670
Yeah

4553
03:43:16,670 --> 03:43:19,809
I don't think i'm doing enough

4554
03:43:19,809 --> 03:43:21,329
I definitely was not

4555
03:43:21,329 --> 03:43:26,129
Dude, i'm telling you the odds are stacked against us because otk tournament and they want tectone to win

4556
03:43:26,940 --> 03:43:27,979
gg

4557
03:43:27,979 --> 03:43:30,399
They had four sumi pros and tectone

4558
03:43:31,020 --> 03:43:33,020
Sure, it's an nt. What the heck

4559
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:39,010
I'm kidding. I'm just maybe we get more magic damage. Don't don't we get more magic damage? Oh

4560
03:43:39,409 --> 03:43:44,850
That wouldn't have changed anything. I'm magic. They even hired the fire dragon to get I was just dead half the time

4561
03:43:45,489 --> 03:43:51,389
the fire giant

4562
03:43:51,389 --> 03:43:56,299
Wow, well

4563
03:43:56,299 --> 03:44:01,100
Um gg guys, I guess, you know, it was a good try wasn't it? Wait, wait, we're done

4564
03:44:01,739 --> 03:44:04,510
Yeah, yeah, we're out. Where's our coach?

4565
03:44:05,979 --> 03:44:08,459
He's giving up on us. He doesn't even want to hear from us

4566
03:44:09,899 --> 03:44:11,899
I think

4567
03:44:12,620 --> 03:44:14,620
Oh tiebreaker

4568
03:44:15,500 --> 03:44:19,100
We might have another chance do we have another chance for the for the hundred million dollars

4569
03:44:19,819 --> 03:44:24,659
I think the tiebreaker is like the wind speed though, like whoever won the fastest out of all three of you guys

4570
03:44:24,739 --> 03:44:26,739
So I don't know who that is

4571
03:44:27,620 --> 03:44:31,170
We got noob stomp by kali. I forgot her alt makes her unkillable

4572
03:44:31,629 --> 03:44:37,629
Well, you guys like we're actually fragging until you all died to the fire giant. Yeah, that was the turning point that that was like

4573
03:44:38,590 --> 03:44:41,790
If we uh, I think we probably would have won the game if we didn't die there

4574
03:44:41,790 --> 03:44:45,309
If you had done the fire before like a couple times you guys wouldn't have died to it

4575
03:44:45,389 --> 03:44:47,389
It was just because you guys didn't know

4576
03:44:47,629 --> 03:44:50,270
That would have been a nuts call. Like you would have just won the game that early, too

4577
03:44:52,190 --> 03:44:56,110
Well, what happened was they started without me and then they also ran away. Yeah

4578
03:44:56,750 --> 03:44:58,510
I didn't even know

4579
03:44:58,510 --> 03:45:02,510
I I was in I died first. I I was in there with 40% health and just died

4580
03:45:03,149 --> 03:45:07,709
I tried to jump away with like 10% health and just got instantly killed. That's all right

4581
03:45:09,059 --> 03:45:11,219
If we win the tiebreaker, we're still freaking going strong

4582
03:45:11,940 --> 03:45:17,520
That would be I need to put can I pick something that hits like hits harder maybe more cc like

4583
03:45:18,159 --> 03:45:20,639
Uh, yeah, we can we can give you something else if there's another game

4584
03:45:22,110 --> 03:45:24,110
Oh, yeah, true. If there's another game

4585
03:45:25,629 --> 03:45:32,350
That baron dude was nuts. He was just bragging me out like just sucking me in and pulling everybody in he was kind of tanky, too

4586
03:45:33,309 --> 03:45:36,770
Yeah

4587
03:45:36,770 --> 03:45:38,770
Dude that kali was just

4588
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:41,170
Oh, yeah running through us

4589
03:45:41,809 --> 03:45:50,379
Yeah, you you forget that it's like oh my god, i'm gonna kill the kali. No, she's invincible for like 10 seconds

4590
03:45:51,020 --> 03:45:52,739
Yeah

4591
03:45:52,739 --> 03:46:04,459
And even your brain is still just like why why is why won't she die? I'm hurting her they hacked

4592
03:46:09,739 --> 03:46:11,739
They were aim locking

4593
03:46:11,979 --> 03:46:21,280
and wall hacking

4594
03:46:21,280 --> 03:46:23,940
Yeah, so what's the uh,

4595
03:46:23,940 --> 03:46:26,340
What's the what's the what's the story now? We're waiting for in the game

4596
03:46:26,340 --> 03:46:32,260
The top teams are playing for the championship like the teams are the best records and then I don't know who's playing for second or

4597
03:46:32,420 --> 03:46:33,379
Who's playing for third?

4598
03:46:33,379 --> 03:46:34,340
Hmm

4599
03:46:34,340 --> 03:46:46,979
They're talking about it. I think we just have to wait and see gamers

4600
03:46:54,850 --> 03:46:57,979
Well, it's fun at least

4601
03:46:58,059 --> 03:47:00,159
Yeah fun

4602
03:47:00,159 --> 03:47:02,159
We gotta see you naked

4603
03:47:02,159 --> 03:47:03,870
That's true

4604
03:47:03,870 --> 03:47:08,100
Yeah, that's a good time

4605
03:47:08,100 --> 03:47:14,239
Just blame Russell move on that was definitely my adc's fault

4606
03:47:18,379 --> 03:47:19,819
adc's are just

4607
03:47:19,819 --> 03:47:21,819
I did throw i'm sorry

4608
03:47:21,899 --> 03:47:25,180
Adc's are weak bro. You know how it works. Sorry Russell

4609
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:33,600
No, wait, we we just we just injected steroids and just screamed and we were just going crazy and then just ran

4610
03:47:33,920 --> 03:47:35,920
Straight as fast as we could into a brick wall

4611
03:47:37,040 --> 03:47:40,319
Yeah, there was a fire giant. It was just like I could fucking do anything

4612
03:47:41,840 --> 03:47:44,799
With the hype behind fucking pokes voice too. He was like

4613
03:47:46,719 --> 03:47:51,280
I thought we could have done I think I think we can we could have done it but we did it bad

4614
03:47:51,920 --> 03:47:53,920
Wait, no, we could have we

4615
03:47:54,479 --> 03:47:57,680
Screaming fire giant like we're just doing a fucking ritual and then we just died

4616
03:47:58,860 --> 03:48:04,620
I mean, I feel like we all had so much health for a second and then it just went away fire giant hurt. Yeah

4617
03:48:09,180 --> 03:48:11,659
Hey, I think we did pretty good for a bunch of people. Hey

4618
03:48:12,379 --> 03:48:17,260
How many we haven't played the game in like six or seven years somebody eight years?

4619
03:48:17,659 --> 03:48:19,979
Noco you downloaded the game two hours ago

4620
03:48:20,930 --> 03:48:25,090
Yeah, I think I think we did pretty good. I think we did pretty damn good. No, he didn't

4621
03:48:25,649 --> 03:48:29,969
Yeah, we all did great. Like I think I even outlained like a professional league of legends pro

4622
03:48:31,059 --> 03:48:33,059
I think I think we did really good

4623
03:48:33,139 --> 03:48:35,139
Then I think we could probably get like third place

4624
03:48:37,180 --> 03:48:39,280
I mean russell didn't show up yesterday

4625
03:48:45,500 --> 03:48:50,129
Come on I didn't do bad

4626
03:48:50,129 --> 03:48:56,770
That's copium. Hey, we're allowed to huff copium. We just group b is wait both groups have three o's and then one twos

4627
03:48:57,409 --> 03:48:59,809
Across the board. So wait, are we going to be third place?

4628
03:49:00,579 --> 03:49:02,579
I don't know. Do we get money?

4629
03:49:02,819 --> 03:49:04,899
We might be second

4630
03:49:04,899 --> 03:49:06,899
Bro, we bro we get money

4631
03:49:07,979 --> 03:49:10,940
Wait, no, but that's not the bracket is it are we playing to get in the bracket?

4632
03:49:11,020 --> 03:49:13,180
I don't get it. I honestly don't understand how this is working

4633
03:49:14,139 --> 03:49:18,500
He said whoever loses in the semis, I don't know what the fuck that means. Do we get third?

4634
03:49:19,219 --> 03:49:21,219
So how long from now is that?

4635
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:23,920
I don't even know

4636
03:49:24,399 --> 03:49:26,719
Wait, do only the top teams from the group play now

4637
03:49:30,100 --> 03:49:33,139
They play for the finals like you're playing the final championship game already

4638
03:49:33,139 --> 03:49:35,620
But there's I guess a loser's like third place

4639
03:49:39,940 --> 03:49:42,979
Oh, I see there's okay 70 years

4640
03:49:43,299 --> 03:49:50,260
There's 3030 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12. Wow. Oh, all right. That's gonna be a shit show to figure out

4641
03:49:55,899 --> 03:49:57,899
That's gonna be an absolute shit show

4642
03:49:58,299 --> 03:50:01,969
Oh, yeah

4643
03:50:01,969 --> 03:50:05,489
Wait, dude, i'm hungry

4644
03:50:07,729 --> 03:50:10,610
I need food. I just need to know if we play more or not

4645
03:50:11,010 --> 03:50:13,010
Yeah, same because if not i'm going to apex

4646
03:50:20,399 --> 03:50:26,000
I thought you were trolling by the way 12 12 12 12 12. Is that troll? Nope. No, it is real

4647
03:50:26,559 --> 03:50:33,040
Those are the numbers. There's only one team really dangerous. There's six teams with one two and there's two teams with three. Oh, huh

4648
03:50:33,520 --> 03:50:38,879
Oh two teams with three. Oh, okay. Yeah two teams three. Oh, can we just all share a third place like that would be fine, right?

4649
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:43,120
Yeah, wait, that's actually such a good idea. Why doesn't otk just give us all money?

4650
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:46,639
We're just like hey everybody else lost but you did a good job

4651
03:50:47,200 --> 03:50:49,440
Yeah, I think isn't it? Isn't that basically what twitch rivals is?

4652
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:50,719
Yeah

4653
03:50:50,719 --> 03:50:57,950
Yeah, I think the only thing good thing about this right now is that it's about the rain. It's about the what the rain

4654
03:50:58,350 --> 03:51:01,040
It's about to rain. Oh

4655
03:51:02,659 --> 03:51:09,700
I love the rain. Oh, could I leave?

4656
03:51:18,510 --> 03:51:20,510
We should get paid for being held hostage

4657
03:51:20,590 --> 03:51:23,100
Honestly true

4658
03:51:23,100 --> 03:51:28,530
I have so much to do guys. I'm very hungry. Wouldn't you have to be a you freaking busy man or something?

4659
03:51:28,850 --> 03:51:33,569
Yeah, I mean, I guess we could I guess we could just like host the main stream and

4660
03:51:34,129 --> 03:51:39,090
Just go you're gonna end stream in I was honestly just trolling. I have nothing. Well, actually yeah, I do I do

4661
03:51:39,649 --> 03:51:56,750
but not like

4662
03:51:56,750 --> 03:52:03,870
Pay us pay us now. Oh because they bet I see they bet on our team winning the whole thing

4663
03:52:04,799 --> 03:52:09,940
Oh, did they actually well, well he's talking about his yeah twitch channel points. Yeah

4664
03:52:10,659 --> 03:52:13,979
I was like damn they really believed in us like that

4665
03:52:15,979 --> 03:52:17,979
I was like, no, I feel like I let everybody down

4666
03:52:18,930 --> 03:52:24,059
Uh, there is definitely not a chance to win the tournament. So I think that is official, right? Yeah

4667
03:52:25,420 --> 03:52:26,379
No

4668
03:52:26,379 --> 03:52:40,100
My fight money. I want to say i'm just really happy that I uh, I knew what buff camps were what i'm proud of you

4669
03:52:40,420 --> 03:52:42,420
I think I think that was a good one

4670
03:52:42,420 --> 03:52:50,110
That was intense. That was fun. Did you get you riled up? I did. I think you guys are done. Yeah, we didn't make it

4671
03:52:50,750 --> 03:52:52,350
No

4672
03:52:52,350 --> 03:52:54,940
Wait, what place did we end up?

4673
03:52:54,940 --> 03:52:57,899
Thank god. Oh man, we're not in the last place. Are we?

4674
03:52:58,940 --> 03:53:02,780
Oh, oh, okay

4675
03:53:03,340 --> 03:53:06,940
How did they even decide who got thrown out? I think we're all last place for playing smite

4676
03:53:07,100 --> 03:53:11,629
I think it was fastest win from our bracket fastest win from the other bracket our freeze

4677
03:53:14,829 --> 03:53:16,350
Our fight money

4678
03:53:16,430 --> 03:53:24,020
I had a reverse monster gg guys. I mean all that matters that we tried our best, right? I was naked on camera today

4679
03:53:25,459 --> 03:53:27,459
Well, you weren't on camera

4680
03:53:28,899 --> 03:53:31,299
Someone took a picture of you. I was literally naked

4681
03:53:32,700 --> 03:53:41,200
You keep saying you were wearing shorts. Are you lying now? Yes. Wait, but which one is the line guys ggs? Yeah

4682
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:45,120

4685
03:53:54,879 --> 03:53:59,680
He's like, I I could have made money on some other things like I could have made 12k bro

4686
03:54:00,319 --> 03:54:03,139
You give me that you give me a bunch of fucking chumps. Yeah

4687

That's not like with the losers. All right, did you guys see you later guys? Thanks for playing. All right guys

4688
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:21,260
That was the uh, that was the tournament. I think we played pretty well fire giant shit that we were I think we were just high

4689
03:54:21,659 --> 03:54:25,180
You know on our own supply

4690
03:54:25,180 --> 03:54:29,469
I think for like I said before a couple people that hadn't really played the game before

4691
03:54:30,940 --> 03:54:35,260
And then the rest of the team hadn't really played that much for years. I think we did pretty well

4692
03:54:35,260 --> 03:54:38,860
I think that was that was a good showing we could have played a lot better obviously, right?

4693
03:54:38,860 --> 03:54:52,940
But whatever it was so fun. It was fun. Yeah, hopefully it was fun to watch

4694
03:54:53,100 --> 03:54:57,219
Yeah, sorry. I wasn't really interacting with the chat at all. I'm trying to at least

4695
03:54:58,540 --> 03:55:07,280
Be somewhat involved in the the call-outs and stuff. But yeah, I I think that's it. That's pretty much all I had planned

4696
03:55:08,239 --> 03:55:10,959
I want to um

4697
03:55:10,959 --> 03:55:12,959
I want to just make sure I reiterate

4698
03:55:13,219 --> 03:55:16,659
The next stream is going to be uh, the green screen stream, which would be the 30th

4699
03:55:17,489 --> 03:55:22,579
I have hundreds of actions i'm going to do in front of the green screen. It should be a fun time

4700
03:55:22,659 --> 03:55:27,090
It always is so see ya in front of see at the green screen stream

4701
03:55:29,010 --> 03:55:31,809
I don't really have a start time, but it's going to be somewhere in the afternoon pacific

4702
03:55:32,209 --> 03:55:36,510
But I want to make sure that i'm ready to go so I don't really have like a hard starting time

4703
03:55:36,510 --> 03:55:46,319
Just so i'll let you know at some point in the afternoon june 30th

4704
03:55:48,159 --> 03:55:52,399
Uh, congratulations or good luck to whoever is going to win this tournament because I mean it's 100k

4705
03:55:52,479 --> 03:55:59,920
It's a lot of money. So good luck. And yeah, I i'm not going to do any really altar or anything

4706
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:07,920
I just was kind of streaming. So there's another perspective good night. Goodbye

4707
03:56:08,379 --> 03:56:11,899
