1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:09,349
Ah yes, Super Frog. Hi guys. We're a little early, yeah. I want to start early because

2
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:17,019
this stream, I'm not going to have very much time today. If you don't know, this stream is the last

3
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:27,370
stream you're going to get for a small but significant amount of time. After today's stream,

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:37,259
you will not see me again until Friday of next week. I'm not going to be here for about five or

5
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:44,840
six straight days. Part of the reason why I wanted to do five plus days in a row here.

6
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:52,229
I'm supposed to start in 30 minutes. Yeah, I was starting early because I don't have,

7
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:01,530
um, I have until about four to five hours from right now. So I wanted to really start and get

8
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:14,760
going. What are we supposed to do for that time? I recommend read the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.

9
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,900
It'll take you a week and then you can come back to me and say, hey, I've read it all.

10
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,349
Actually, that'd probably take longer. That actually would probably take a couple months.

11
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,030
So I'm not, I'm not leaving for a couple months. I'm leaving for about a week.

12
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:49,450
Less, a little less than a week. What a waste of time. Oh man, you guys really don't like reading.

13
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:56,730
But, uh, the plan today is to try and continue our hardcore Diablo 2 adventure.

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,530
If you've missed the last two or two or three times we've done this, we are standing outside

15
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:14,580
of Diablo's area. So Diablo is within 20 minutes of where we are right now.

16
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:27,000
And we have the skeleton crew trying to fight Diablo. So, uh, if this stream turns out to be

17
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:35,900
40 minutes long because I die to Diablo because I'm not prepared for it, we'll do something else.

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:44,280
But the plan is to try to stay alive and to get into act five and keep going. We'll see.

19
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,500
Don't flatter yourself. I feel like it'll take, it'll take 40 minutes to even get to him

20
00:02:51,500 --> 00:03:05,819
because of how our character is currently built. The plan is simple. Yeah, if, if I die

21
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:14,340
in Diablo, the Asura's Wrath DLC is the plan. But I don't plan on dying in Diablo. I plan on playing

22
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:28,919
for at least a few hours. Here comes the flush force. For the love of God, please do not die.

23
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,490
We have an interesting chat today, I think, because a bunch of people in chat might want me to die

24
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,689
because they want to see Asura's Wrath really bad. They get the DLC there, but there are also

25
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:47,050
a bunch of people that don't want to see the Asura's Wrath DLC and they're like, no, I don't,

26
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,039
I don't want that. I will. I please stay alive in Diablo. It's going to be an interesting day.

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,979
There's a civil war here. All right, let's, uh, we've waited long enough. It's been about five

28
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,699
minutes. Let's get into it. Hope you're having a good day. If you missed yesterday's stream.

29
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,580
Well, yeah, technically yesterday. Tony Hawk's Underground was a lot of fun.

30
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:24,250
Let's try to kill Diablo. I'm almost level 30. So I got to get a refresher here. Oh, that's right.

31
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:32,069
We did Raal Raal. Probably the worst thing ever. I made stealth. I don't really have very good

32
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:40,389
items, do I? My items are kind of terrible. All right. I'm going to die in the first five minutes.

33
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:48,470
I know. Hey, get, get, get your Asura's, Asura's Wrath DLC hype ready in the chat, boys and girls,

34
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:57,529
because I'm probably dead in 10 minutes. I need a skeleton crew to refresh your memory. Here is

35
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:05,959
where chat has decided to put the points. We have a lot in Iron Golem. I'm going to make sure you

36
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,480
just give a quick little refresher course. It's been about a week and a half since you've seen

37
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:19,420
this. Ray skeleton, skeleton mastery. You've gone down into the, you've gone down into the Golems.

38
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,769
Iron Golem members. Iron Golem gives synergy, 20 attack rating per level to all Golems.

39
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:35,209
You put points into skeleton mage. We are about to unlock in, if I'm to stay alive, that is we're

40
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:50,089
about to unlock fireman or revive. All of these are very good. Fire Golem or revive. Revive just

41
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:58,250
lets you bring any character back to life. That's not a boss. So if one of those big demon guys dies,

42
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:07,819
I can bring them back to life and I can do this. Um, like you can have like 20, I think monsters

43
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,899
out at once. I feel like there's going to be a fight here. Uh, thanks for the two teeth. It was

44
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:22,660
a waste of a point. People thought it was funny. I mean, I laughed. It was pretty funny and then

45
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,339
amplify damage. Obviously if you don't put a one point and amplify damage as a necromancer, I mean,

46
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,720
what the hell are you doing? So that about does it. We have this guy here. We have, uh, Vic is

47
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:44,170
still with us. Vic, uh, by the way, Vic has better gear than I do because the, uh, the real hero here.

48
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:55,180
So let's do river of flame. I'm, I think I'm ready. I didn't even get it. I didn't wait. Did I not

49
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:08,300
step on the waypoint? Did I not step on the waypoint last time? No, I did. Didn't I? Didn't we

50
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,959
get to the river of flame and I like stepped on the waypoint? Did I? That's a big oops. Oh shit.

51
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:25,399
That's actually really bad. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Now I got here.

52
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:31,509
Yep. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. We're good. They were, I didn't get to the waypoint. I did the,

53
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:40,980
uh, the gems. All right. I gotta be careful. This is probably going to be a quick one. So what

54
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,550
happened to Sir's wrath so far? The story, uh, you're one of the eight deities or you were until

55
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:58,329
you were cast away from all, from there's seven of them now. Nah, we'll be fine. Let me get my

56
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:05,220
skeleton crew up and we'll be good to go. My man, I have such shit, man. All right. We're going to

57
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:13,899
have five regular skeletons and we can add three majors. I believe I've got the whole crew. Uh,

58
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:22,660
we need to amplify damage. All right. I'm, I feel a little safer. What is my fire resistance? Not

59
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,189
good. I don't think we should fight Diablo without proper fire resistance, but you know,

60
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:49,320
we'll see if we can get some. I'm going to take it very slow because I really don't want to play

61
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,200
Diablo for 12 minutes. I would, I would like to actually kill Diablo. All right. Let's go this

62
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:13,450
way. Right. Any majors, like for instance, up here, Diablo is a discount sun joke.

63
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,259
You could say that, but today is going to be fairly chill. It's not going to be that long.

64
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:29,799
It'll be probably about four, three, four, five hour long stream. I want to relax a little bit.

65
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:35,879
Last night was a little all over the place. I, uh, I got some good sleep though. I'm feeling

66
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:48,409
refreshed. You are so fucked laughing my ass off. I know. I know. I see the end of the tunnel

67
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,200
and I know what the outcome is. What's really going to end up happening

68
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,500
is this guy is going to have to kill Diablo. Not me. I'm going to have nothing to do with it.

69
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,559
That guy. Yeah, Vic. He's the one that killed Duriel. He's the one that killed Mephisto and

70
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:27,529
he'll be the one to kill Diablo. I'm just a bard that follows him around with my skeleton band.

71
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:38,379
We just sing while he fucking does work. All these skeletons all have different

72
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:45,659
fucking instruments. What a real pain in the ass that would be too. Imagine you had like a full

73
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:54,919
eight person band following you around. Three of them are singing. Two of them have little drums

74
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,240
be like, get the fuck away from me. They're all getting in the way.

75
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,730
That would suck because that's what we're doing to this guy.

76
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:16,100
How are we going? I really do want the way point though.

77
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:29,419
One of them's playing their rib cage like a xylophone. Uh, it's so stupid. I love it.

78
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:40,139
I love it. I really do wonder what you guys are going to do because revive is so good.

79
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:47,269
It's so good. But you know, there is, there is a channel community character.

80
00:11:48,389 --> 00:12:01,960
I feel like that's going to win out over everything else. How's everybody doing? Everyone

81
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,919
good? Everyone feel safe? Everybody's dead. So that's a good sign. When I open the seals,

82
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:21,960
though, that's what it's going to be really painful. That was a lot of damage with one hit.

83
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,529
I think I really would, I think I'm going to get a pole going or maybe one of the mods can do it

84
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:38,460
well because I don't really want to die. Do you think I will beat Diablo? You think I will kill

85
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:49,799
Diablo? I got a wink. Did I? I'll do the pole. Let me see. Did I get a wink? No, I didn't. I didn't.

86
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:56,440
Nice try though. Uh, let me get a, let me get a pole. I'm actually curious as to what people

87
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:06,759
think about this because I have my answer, but I want to know your answer. I'm curious

88
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:50,539
what your answer is. Let's see. Vote on this. I'm going to check it later. Okay. Let's go.

89
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:04,970
Those are three very real scenarios. I do. I don't just die or I give up because I have to

90
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:15,620
run back and forth to the blood war. There's a no option for you both dying. Um, I'm not going to,

91
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:20,169
no, this, this isn't like a boxing game. We're not going to do a double knockout.

92
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:30,789
One of us is dead or I take 10% HP off of his bar every eight minutes and it gets to about

93
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:35,110
40% of the way there and it's been 40 minutes and I'm just done. And I'm like, no, nevermind

94
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:56,330
any of those are possible. I can get it. Once we get to the actual, that like sanctuary place,

95
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,169
not sanctuary, you know what I mean? What's the place before Diablo called? It has a specific

96
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,210
name. It's probably not the rip. What is it? It's like, it's like his castle.

97
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:16,330
Why do I not know this? You like, do you actually like this game, Jeremy? Do you enjoy playing this?

98
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:25,639
I feel like you really want to play goat simulator. There it is. Okay. Good. Here we go.

99
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,159
You know, I'm really just hiding the fact that I want to play goat simulator. Here it comes.

100
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:54,659
Why do these angels help? Proceed hero. You're the Nephilim. That's why you can do this.

101
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:04,389
Did I mention I can shoot lightning out of my hand? No, you do it. I gotta be careful.

102
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:13,179
I understand like the whole, no, no, no, I can't interfere. I can't interfere.

103
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:18,730
Terrial could just do a cleave and kill every enemy on this fucking map.

104
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,129
Like, could you at least just do that for me? Fine. Don't fight Diablo, but can you just drop

105
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:32,789
like a fucking angel nuke on this spot so we can just walk to him? And look, you can ghost ride it.

106
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:41,620
I'll just say I did it in the history books. And it'll just be like, and then the brave

107
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:48,580
skeleton necromancer conjured up a gigantic ball of lightning and dropped it onto the river of

108
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:59,210
flame. Like, why can't you just say that? Does it matter? And I'll just, in all the interviews

109
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,889
that I do afterwards, I'll just be like, yeah, no, it was, I don't know. I just kind of did.

110
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:08,809
I used all my strength. I tried as hard as I could. And I, yeah, I don't, I can never do

111
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:28,700
it again though. I used all my energy. Yeah, the CCTV installed. Wait, would you like, like,

112
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:37,910
they're monitoring what's going on right now? Okay, but you wouldn't like the game.

113
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:46,900
Okay, but we're talking, we're talking strictly lore here. We're not talking about game, video

114
00:17:46,900 --> 00:18:03,660
gameplay. Don't die. I got a full crew, right? Once those super uniques come out of the seals

115
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,759
is where I'm really going to have to shift my pants. I got to have portals ready. Can you

116
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:26,230
imagine a guy named Tommy Lee Bones in the history books? Use teeth. Teeth does three damage. What

117
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:44,089
I'm doing right now does 36 to 104. Teeth does three. All right, gollum's gonna die. Hey, come

118
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:57,210
on. A little bit higher. Oh, I have to kill Diablo with teeth. But you want to last hit Diablo with

119
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:06,900
teeth? That make you guys happy? Would you guys be happy satisfied if I did that? I'm not even

120
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:17,140
sure it's possible. All right, here it is. Oh, boy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:37,000
Just back it up. I need fire resistance. Bad. Still have these stamina potions for some reason.

122
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:47,529
Dude, that was an auto tube. What am I going to do with this shit? Does anything have fire

123
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:57,319
resistance? Oh, this does. I lose 41 health. That's a lot of health, but I gained 25%.

124
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,569
Me taking, let's say I take 100 points of damage from fire and like somebody does a 100 damage

125
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:19,319
spell is having 41 more health better than taking 75% of that. The health is better, right? Or is

126
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:28,069
the percentage better? I don't know. I need to do some math. I'm going to wear it. Any other

127
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:42,039
fire resist shields? You know, I need like a socket shield because with the socketed shield,

128
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,390
I could just dump rupees into it and get fire resist. There was ruining chat's character. What?

129
00:20:52,390 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm just trying to, I'm trying to survive, man. His inventory is a mess. I should just sell this

130
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:18,410
thing. All right. I'm selling this. I'm at 33% fire resist. It's not very good. Resist is way

131
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:24,059
better than 40 health. I'm under 300 though. I'm going to get fucking double tapped and die

132
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,980
instantly. Okay. What do I have? I can't do anything. All right. Somebody's trash can

133
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:43,079
ruins have got to go here eventually. I think how many portals do I have? Let's go. It's still

134
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:49,910
alive, right? All right. Everybody get up here. There's the chaos sanctuary here. Oh fuck.

135
00:21:50,789 --> 00:22:15,859
What do they have for resistance right now? Oh, oh, I'm going down. Vic, you got to stay alive,

136
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:30,420
man. We dropped Ruby puke cloud. Good. Nice work. I'm going to turn. I got to turn that into

137
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:41,059
a friend Gothic shield. Wait, I don't have anything. I need to find like a weapon there.

138
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:55,990
There let's go. Dodge the missiles. We're good. All right. Into the sanctuary. Let's go. I'm

139
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,690
actually nervous right now. I've never played a character on hardcore. I was just run in and

140
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,130
just don't give a shit is if I die, who cares, right? But even on normal, I'm kind of scared.

141
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:16,259
I really don't want to die, but this is a place where I can die because the boss here is scary

142
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:32,420
and he's hard because if you just, I don't know, we'll see. I'm scared. The one thing I am very

143
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:40,299
thankful of is besides the mages, the majors kind of suck. Everyone's staying alive in here,

144
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:53,299
which is encouraging. What do I do if I die? Oh, that's it. I close Diablo. What else can I do?

145
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:59,339
Make a new character. I'm like, I'm not doing it. I'm not going to do that. Be very, be sad for five

146
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:10,779
to 10 minutes and then move on to something else. All right. We've got to do the seals.

147
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:21,509
If you'd like to see where we're going to end up, Diablo spawns in here. Hey,

148
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:57,190
me. Army versus army. I got to get to level 30. We need an equalizer here. Oops. Oops.

149
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:12,950
All right. This is weakened. Careful. Vic, you good? All right. What does Vic have for fire

150
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:28,859
resistance? 58. Just keep Vic alive. Keep Vic alive. What you got to do is you got to get the

151
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:40,259
ball, the tuck. Arnold, I want you to pass over here to Helga. Helga, I want you to drive to the

152
00:25:40,259 --> 00:26:00,019
hoop and then I want you to get the ball, the tuck. You guys don't like Hey Arnold? Nobody likes that

153
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:18,059
show. How old are you guys? Hey Arnold was like 20. If you guys are like 20, you didn't see Hey

154
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:37,450
Arnold? That was the thing in Hey Arnold. Oh shit, we got stuff. I loved Hey Arnold. My character

155
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:46,970
wasn't in the show for very long, but it was like a big episode. All right. I'll keep my references

156
00:26:46,970 --> 00:27:06,390
to Garfield and SpongeBob. Garfield's older than Hey Arnold. He's just still relevant though. He's

157
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:28,410
been around for a long time. Thank you. Thank you. That's better. When was the last time you guys

158
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,970
actually read a Garfield comedy? I'm not talking about online. I'm talking about in a newspaper.

159
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:48,680
Never? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. For the amount of stuff you guys did. For the amount of talk.

160
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,680
For the amount that everyone talks about Garfield. I was assuming you guys were all big fans.

161
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:13,940
I get requests to play Garfield's card. Maybe like once every four days. All right. I have to be

162
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:29,400
careful up here. This beer sucks. This sucks too. I don't even want it. He said it. See you. Let's go.

163
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:54,859
This is Lord de Sace. I remember. Diablo does time seven damage to summons.

164
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:04,920
That's going to end very well for us. I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked. You have no idea guys.

165
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:12,859
I'm so fucked. I have to fight Diablo alone. I'm so, I'm going to die. It's going to be really,

166
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:31,079
really bad. I need to get more fire resist if I stand a chance. We'll probably get to

167
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:37,450
level 30 though. So that'd be good. Don't get in the middle of a firestorm.

168
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:59,750
Come on. Level up. I need it. This is a huge amount of money just came in. Hold on. Actually

169
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,700
huge, huge money. Oh, I was supposed to, let me see the, will he, let me check this first.

170
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,359
Will he kill Diablo? Most of you think yes. Besides the people that think I'm going to

171
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,740
run around in circles for 30 minutes and they give up. I appreciate the enthusiasm though. Thank you.

172
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:23,460
Thanks guys. I just mentioned it and now more votes are coming in. All right. All right. Not

173
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,059
very many people don't think I'm going to do it. That's, that really is encouraging. Okay. Let's

174
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:46,170
get my, let's get my bits up here. Somebody gave a hundred bucks. Rentaburger gave 10,000 bits

175
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:54,650
thanks to the hundred fucking dollars Rentaburger. I can't believe I get to become a sub baby in a

176
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,609
Diablo 2 stream. Come a long way from the first of your videos I ever saw. I watched Germania in

177
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:14,180
2014 for almost an entire minute before I realized it was funny on purpose. I'm confused. What does

178
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,660
that mean? I watched Germania for almost an entire minute before I really, oh, you thought it was,

179
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:30,019
you thought it was somebody making like a real league or something? Funny by accident. That's so

180
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:43,460
funny. Yeah, we got a wink too. Got my backpack. I'm ready for school. Hey, is that a different

181
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:57,029
Germa? He looks different today. I'm not wearing overalls. It's imposter Jeremy. No, it's because

182
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:00,230
my pupils are small because the sun's in my eyes. That's what people don't, that's what it is.

183
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:10,970
I'm not wearing a backpack. No, I've got, I'm wearing my boomer brace for my costochondritis.

184
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:24,710
You have small pupils. I do look like I'm going to school though. Just waiting for the bus mom.

185
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,710
No, it's, I got a costochondritis. I got a fucking back brace on

186
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:42,950
as you wink. Uh, but rent a burger. Thank you so much for the fucking ridiculous amount of money.

187
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:48,710
A hundred dollars. I never expect anyone to give one dollar, let alone a hundred of them.

188
00:32:49,910 --> 00:33:06,099
Seriously. Thanks. Am I wearing beads on my wrist? Shit, shit that you saw it. God damn it. No,

189
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:20,390
I forgot this was on. It's, it's a, it's, it's black tourmaline. It's like a crystal bracelet.

190
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,990
I, I, I'm just wearing it because I, it's a crystal bracelet. It's black tourmaline

191
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,940
and it's supposed to help with your energy. It's not, it's made up. Like it's literally all made up.

192
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,579
I just thought it was cute that I put it on. It's literally the whole, the whole thing's made up.

193
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:46,789
Uh, somebody made it up and sold bracelets to people. I just thought it was cool. It's like

194
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:52,549
cool. That's an interesting idea. Like, oh, it's like crystals and it's like power crystals.

195
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:59,029
It's, I know it's like, could be just bullshit. Whatever. It's fun. It was like 12 bucks. Add a

196
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:07,900
couple zeros. It's cool. There's like different crystals. This is like, look, okay, hold on. Let

197
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:16,250
me, why is my game crashing? I am not going to lose in act. I'm going to, I'll save and exit.

198
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:29,190
Okay. Um, look, see, isn't this cool? It's like a gem. It's like a stone. It's a crystal. It's

199
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:39,500
like kind of interesting. I don't, I don't like think it's going to like heal my ailments because

200
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,179
I think it would look cool. And it's like interesting concept and it's like cool like history.

201
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,329
And I always take this off before streams. I know someone's going to be like, what the fuck is he

202
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:52,889
wearing? And then I have to do a baby food explanation and I wanted to avoid the baby food

203
00:34:52,889 --> 00:35:02,949
explanation, but I had, all right. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. I have

204
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:24,789
to hold on. I leveled up. Why is everybody getting smoked? Somebody said it's just a bracelet, dude.

205
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:32,619
It's all right. I know, but it's a, it's like a black tourmaline crystal stone bracelet.

206
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:52,650
Holy fuck. This guy is eating me alive. I think it's neat. Yeah. I think it's cool. It's all right.

207
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:04,469
We good. Who is it? Just Lord they say. All right. Get in there and holy fuck. I'm in trouble.

208
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:11,820
I'm just going to keep putting people in there. Dude, they're dying before they can even come out

209
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:27,579
of, they die before they can even like get out of the womb or whatever this is. Get in there.

210
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:44,840
Goodbye. We're going to fall back and we have a point to put in. That's priority. Number one

211
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:51,460
right now. We've got a point. Uh, click maps are going to be enabled here. If you'd like to vote

212
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,780
for something, you just have to click the screen. You will see it on the screen in just a moment.

213
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:09,349
Okay. So here's what the points are so far. We have unlocked the bottom row on the summoning side.

214
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,949
And again, this is fire Golem and this is revive. Revive can bring anything back to life for a

215
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:21,989
significant portion of time. Fire Golem is fireman. We also have the other points here.

216
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:31,219
Summon resist Golem mastery. You don't have to be embarrassed about owning crystals for their

217
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:39,380
properties. I know where it gives me power. How do you guys think I can like fucking, how do you

218
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,139
think, where do you think my comedy comes from? It comes from this fucking bracelet. I don't wear

219
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:53,699
this. I've can't, I'm not funny. This is where it comes from. It's a comedy bracelet. When I take this

220
00:37:53,699 --> 00:38:00,420
off, I like, I like decrepify. I've got somewhere I got like boomer brace on like power crystals.

221
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:13,349
All right. Where do you guys want to go? What are you thinking? We may have to zoom in for this one.

222
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:38,019
We might have to zoom in. We'll see if it splits. Do I have a Zen garden? No, it would die.

223
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:42,730
I wouldn't, I would, I can't be, I wouldn't be, I would, it would die. I wouldn't be able to take

224
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:50,710
care of it. I would be like, dude, Zen garden. Oh, I can't wait. And I would, the first day I would

225
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,670
strip, strip, strip, trim, trim, trim, place the rocks, put the trees. Ooh, this is so cool. And

226
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,349
I'd put it out in the sun. Wow. And I'd forget it was there. And then three weeks later, everything

227
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:14,019
would be dead and I would find it. I'm going to zoom in. Oh, wait, that, wait, that, that's,

228
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:18,420
that's one of those trees. That's one of those little trees. Wrong. Zen garden is not, what's

229
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,659
it called? Uh, the, the little tree, the bonsai tree. Yeah. Whoops. Zen garden is just sand with

230
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:35,670
rocks. I'd fucking spill it. Not a bonsai tree, not a bonsai. No, it's a bonsai tree, bonsai,

231
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:46,539
bonsi tree, bonsai tree, bonsi buddy tree. All right. Let me zoom this shit in because you guys,

232
00:39:46,539 --> 00:40:00,920
you guys are, you're split at the bottom. You're not supposed to see that.

233
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,599
Did you guys know that when a graphic is on screen, it's like magic?

234
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:18,340
All right. Choose wisely. Decrepify for fuck's sake. Gray, I can't, I cannot influence anything.

235
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:42,840
They've chosen to be down here. I, uh, I can't click poison over guys. That's, we don't have

236
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:56,260
enough points. All right. Spreading ourselves out. We're going to make our own Diablo.

237
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:08,010
We have, he's exactly like you in every way, except he's one eighth your size.

238
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:32,409
Here we go. Fire golem, mini Diablo. There he is. How strong is he? 400 health, 165 attack, 40,

239
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:40,789
410 defense, absorbs 36% of fire damage, fire damage, 44 to 90. Holy fire. 46. It's actually

240
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:51,900
going to come down to can my mini me Diablo beat actual Diablo? You think that's a joke? It's not.

241
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:59,130
Where are the stats going? Oh, wait, before I do that, just so you can get a clear indicator,

242
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:06,710
here's what the stats look like right now. Revive Vic? Oh, I absolutely will. I, when we open this

243
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:16,219
last seal, I am not going to get any more skeletons because they're all going to instantly explode.

244
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,900
The presence of Diablo is going to kill every single skeleton. So it's Vic and fireman versus

245
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,300
Diablo. We're not going to get them anymore. All right. You see what the stats are. We have 5%

246
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:35,260
We're not going to get them anymore. All right. You see what the stats are. We have 5 points.

247
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:52,570
All 5 points are going into what you pick. Choose wisely. Choose wisely. And a wink showed up. Yeah,

248
00:42:52,570 --> 00:43:08,230
it did. All in on vitality. Yeah, this is not, this is not even a contest.

249
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:29,449
You're all right. You look like you're in pain. I do? I look, oh, I think I look okay. Do I look

250
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:44,099
like I'm in pain? Great hair today. It was styled by a professional. A shower head and then a comb.

251
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:58,630
Vitality. Thanks for voting. Lego hair of the year. New category 2020 awards.

252
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:13,960
Best Lego hair of the year. Back over 300. All right. Here we go. Let's get a Vic back.

253
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:22,679
$6,300. I am going to get a full group though for this. So I'm just going to, I'm only doing

254
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:29,429
this so I can revive some people and then we're going back through the portal. Yeah, I know,

255
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:45,510
I know. I'm just getting a full skeleton crew. Your skin is really clear. Just drink more water.

256
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,949
Make sure you get adequate rest. You want to be, you want to get some good sleep.

257
00:44:50,949 --> 00:45:00,760
Make sure you're sleeping well and also make a blood contract with the devil.

258
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,699
Whatever. It's not, it's not that far. I know where it is. Everything's dead.

259
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,070
Everything's dead. Whatever. Just drink one of these and run. I got a full group.

260
00:45:48,300 --> 00:46:00,019
Mormu. 13 community subs from Mormu. Thank you, Mormu. Congratulations to those that all got them.

261
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:07,820
No, no, no, no, no. Don't even fight. Don't even fight. Just go. How do I do, how do we,

262
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:15,699
how do you do a blood contract with the devil? Look up into the, down to the ground and go,

263
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:29,500
oh, devil of mine, I'd like to open a contract and then a pop-up window will show up

264
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:43,530
and you are, you have to go into a queue. Usually about 16 to 17 years long and then you have your

265
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:59,590
appointment. Okay, what a portal here. Guys, you, you, you gotta remember you, you're going,

266
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,349
you, you're, you're behind people that like sold their soul to the devil for like a pack of gum.

267
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,539
You know, people say this shit all the time. Like, oh, I'd sell my soul for a fucking hamburger

268
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:14,010
right now that you, you now 17 years later, you need to pop up. You will sell this soul for all

269
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:21,159
kinds of fucking crazy shit. How do you think the guy from fucking that pot, how do you think the

270
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:28,309
guy from Popeye died? Burger guy. He sold his soul to the devil for a fucking hamburger. What was

271
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:49,800
his name? Tootie? What was that guy's name? Wimpy. Wimpy. His name was shitty. By the way, I,

272
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,179
I feel like I stole that joke. Anybody else get, feel that? Like, I feel like they've made,

273
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:02,360
somebody's made that joke somewhere. You know what I mean? Like, oh, he's like wimpy, sold his soul

274
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,820
to the devil for a hamburger. That's like an easy joke to do. That's probably something. I'm sure it

275
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:27,750
happened. All right. Uh, once I opened these seals, this is it. Clown anxiety. Oh God. Okay.

276
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:36,389
Let's, I gotta get a portal all the way back here. He's going to say the line. Here we go.

277
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:45,719
Let's open this one first because we're going to get ported on. Okay. You ready?

278
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:59,929
Here we go. Oh, it's this motherfucker. I forgot. Get in there fireman.

279
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:26,119
No way. Vic. All right. This is my Vic fund. At least I have money in the Vic fund.

280
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:43,719
Please keep bringing him back. Oh boy. We're going to, we're going to walk there again

281
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,400
from here because I need another, I need another army. I knew this was going to happen.

282
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:06,619
I can't go back in that portal as the portal will be surrounded. What's my opinion on

283
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:22,329
Warcraft reforged? Um, it would have been nice if it was actually reforged. Warcraft refunded.

284
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:32,900
For some reason, I don't know why Blizzard thinks this, but when you open up the oven

285
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:47,530
to check on your pizza, it's not the same as making a video game. What the fuck does that mean?

286
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:12,139
You know, I was going somewhere. If you reheat. No, I fucked it up. Uh, sorry. Fuck is this not

287
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:17,510
doing on? Uh, I meant to say is, uh, reheating your leftovers is not the same thing as making

288
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:29,579
a new pizza. And why did I take it off? All right. Wait, no, no, don't go over there yet.

289
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:45,460
$1,200 bracelet joke. It's not that much money. It was like, it was probably like $9.

290
00:51:45,460 --> 00:52:02,389
$9. Okay, let's go get in there and start fighting. Go overwhelm them one at a time.

291
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:15,420
They can't, they can't kill us all. Okay. Hold on. Get in overwhelmed. Forget, forget about the big

292
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,110
blue guy. He will instantly kill me if he touches me though. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We're going. We're

293
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:47,079
going. We're going. Get ready. Where's the portal? All right, guys, we've been a, we've been a good

294
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:55,210
crew for a long time. I'm going to need you to step up. Go for it.

295
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:25,269
Get him. He killed everybody. Wait, wait, run away. He, okay. He's got like the 3% of his health is

296
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:36,250
gone. All right. Where's, where's my fire? Wait, iron golem is 397. Fire golem. You and me. I'll

297
00:53:36,250 --> 00:54:01,179
just recast you over and over again. Fight him. Get in there and fight him. Get him. How, why is

298
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:27,590
he, why is he freezing him? I don't have enough mana for this shit. All right. You want another

299
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:36,940
strategy? It's got to be Vic. It's got to be Vic with rejuvenation potions. I just have to spam

300
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:58,599
rejuvenation potions on him. Super, super, super, greater, greater, greater. God, I need a gem.

301
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:14,139
I need chip gems. Oh, let me just try here. You take this helmet. You take this. He's got 75%

302
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:31,929
fire resist. Okay. I'm going to just, let's see how long he lives. This is a test. All right, Vic.

303
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:41,670
He needs lightning. He's got 58% lightning. All right, come on, Vic. Let's go. I'm just going to

304
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:48,539
try to keep you alive. Give Vic the controller. Vic, turn on your blessing, please. You're really

305
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:51,739
going to be the guy in the raid that doesn't have his blessings on and shit. Come on. Do I have to

306
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:56,300
remind everybody? Why do I have, as the raid leader have to constantly tell people how to use their

307
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:35,139
own moves? I have an idea. Iron Golem. Iron Golem returns 225% damage back to the attacker.

308
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:41,610
We're just going to have Diablo kill this guy and hurt himself over and over again.

309
00:56:41,610 --> 00:57:04,820
Let's test the theory. Is it working? Holy shit, it kind of worked. Holy shit, it kind of worked.

310
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:14,380
Leave, run. Oh, that was a ton of damage. Get me out. Get me out. Should I port? He's going to

311
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:21,380
chase me down here. Port here. This is fine. Do you see the damage? That took like, all right.

312
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:28,539
That's the plan. I'm just going to buy like 10 swords. What's the cheapest sword I can possibly

313
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:46,679
buy? All right. Just buy all the cheap shit. Get your helmet back. All right. I'm going to get the

314
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:54,309
helmet back. I need a socket. Give me this. Okay. I got the helmet back and I'm going to get a

315
00:57:54,309 --> 00:58:08,659
socket shield and just put rubies in it. You sell those? Fire defense on any of these? I don't care.

316
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:20,949
I will wear like my big brother's clothes. Look at this. 30%. I don't care about that. Just put it

317
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:39,780
on and give this back. Act one. Good call. But Diablo is going to start. It doesn't matter if

318
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,900
he regens. We're just going to sacrifice like 30 iron golems. We're just going to, okay. We're

319
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:51,699
just going to, we're going to riddle trash all over the arena so I can always revive an iron

320
00:58:51,699 --> 00:59:00,579
golem no matter where I am. I'm going to just back up a dump truck and dump the whole thing

321
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:15,940
into the arena. This is so stupid. What a joke. This is 60. I don't have enough money.

322
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:39,079
Oh no, rub. Just sell this. Use daggers? Well, I, I bought them all.

323
00:59:49,239 --> 01:00:20,980
I already have. Okay. Let's go. Move the potions. So we need a distraction for a minute.

324
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:28,619
That should be enough for a little while. You're triggering me with your inventory management.

325
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:47,260
You know what a seller spider is? If you don't know, look it up. That's how I roll. Holy fuck,

326
01:00:47,260 --> 01:01:04,300
doesn't leave. So we need to do one of these right now. Here's one. All right. I need to do this.

327
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:12,820
Let's start riddling this area. Like I'm going to say this is the trash zone right here.

328
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:54,139
Let's go. He heard himself. Get in there. It's kind of working. I just have to stay alive.

329
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:30,260
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh, he's almost at the O. Oh, that's it. I have nothing left.

330
01:02:30,260 --> 01:03:24,630
What's he at? He's past the O. Get me out of here. It's too big. Too big. Whatever. Impossible. Any

331
01:03:24,630 --> 01:04:30,039
more little ones. That's good. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Your potions suck. Fuck.

332
01:04:30,039 --> 01:05:11,429
Oh my God. I need mana. What's going on? Oh my God. This is where it ends. He put me in a cage.

333
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:55,349
Oh no. Just get up here. Get him. Oh fuck. He's down to the L. Get in there. Get in there. Go get him.

334
01:06:15,019 --> 01:07:11,719
Why? It's starting to get expensive. God damn it, man. These shitty hand axes. Move these potions

335
01:07:11,719 --> 01:08:12,440
out of the way. That's not even metal. Wait, no. Come here. Bait it, bait it, bait it, bait it.

336
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:52,649
He's almost at half health. This is going to work. He can't hit him. Oh, don't run down here. He's

337
01:08:52,649 --> 01:09:14,020
dead. Oh fuck. Wrap around. Where's my pile? Where's my trash? Hit him. Come on. Get in there.

338
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,420
Come on. Get in there. Watch out. I shouldn't be going down that hall anymore. We're going to move

339
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:38,220
our trash. We're going to move our trash over here. This is really the only safe place for it. It's

340
01:09:38,220 --> 01:10:01,460
like up here. Ready? Just don't kill me. Get out of the way, please. He trapped him in a cage.

341
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:30,470
Actually working up for us. He's coming for me. Why? God damn it. Look at his health. All right. I

342
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:35,939
got to back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Look at this. He's almost... This motherfucker is dead.

343
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:43,979
This motherfucker is dead. Ain't no way he wins. Look at his health. Back to act three, act two.

344
01:10:44,619 --> 01:11:40,039
Do you trade? You do. What do you got? Do you have any junk? You do. Let's go. Potions. Trash pile.

345
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:49,619
Going up here. Oh my God. He's right there. Wait. Don't do anything stupid. Right here. Trash pile.

346
01:11:49,619 --> 01:12:24,630
Right here. This is a bad spot. He's already dead. Fuck. I got to get him away. That's a bad spot.

347
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:50,199
Oh my God. Not a good run. Not a good one so far. We got to wrap around the other way. No.

348
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:57,640
He's... We got this tiny fucking hallway. We have to pull him. Don't go in yet. Pull him down here.

349
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:10,810
Pull him down here, please. He done... All right. New strategy. Come with me. We're putting a portal

350
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:27,340
up here. We're going this way. We're doing another trash zone up here. Right here. Up the trash. Good.

351
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:35,189
Okay. Let's go. He'll chase us over here and we have an open space now.

352
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:45,909
Follow me. Chase me. Look. He's a piece behind the D right now. Get over here. Find me. Follow me.

353
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:54,920
Good. I'll bait it.

354
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:11,300
Come on. Come on. We can do it. It's so close. My stamina. Watch that stamina.

355
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:38,439
That was almost a killer. We instantly probably killed him. It's okay. Oh my God. Where's he running?

356
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:56,920
We're out of trash. He's blocked the entrance. Okay. We have to do another trash run. I'm going

357
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:11,529
right in that portal after I cast this. Okay. Go. There's more trash here? Where? I don't see.

358
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:31,659
Oh, I wish that counted. Who sells stuff here? No, no, no. I don't know who sells stuff here.

359
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:39,979
I forget. New act. Act two. Again. Down here. Just... I don't care. Whatever. I have plenty of money.

360
01:15:39,979 --> 01:16:53,899
Okay. No, don't go in. Are you stupid? Come on. Look at how close I am. All right. Trash pile set.

361
01:16:53,899 --> 01:17:01,420
Good run. That was a really good run. Excellent work. Excellent work. Trash. Trash heap number 60.

362
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:28,170
Good job. 61. Not so good. I think he's found. He found the trash. He's spotted. He's spotted. Hold

363
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:55,539
on. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a bad idea. This is a really bad.

364
01:17:55,539 --> 01:18:05,159
That's three damage, guys. Nope. Don't care. I'm living. My heart just exploded. I thought I was

365
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:31,210
dead. He still has too much health. Oh my God. No, no, no. Who cares about jokes? Give me up.

366
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:41,850
Help me. Trash monster number... That was the loudest I think I've... That was the most actual

367
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:48,520
real scream I've done in a long time. That was like I was about to get into a car accident.

368
01:18:53,180 --> 01:19:16,550
I got him. No uniques. Game sucks. I said... Somebody said that was the stupidest fucking way I've

369
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:37,590
ever seen somebody kill Diablo. I worked for it. He's dead. Wow. My title can change now.

370
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:50,489
Oh. Hey, look guys. You see how it saved the run? You guys put six points into iron golem for some

371
01:19:50,489 --> 01:20:12,810
reason. And here he is. He was returning. 225% damage done, returned. That's pretty good.

372
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:26,310
That's pretty good. Dude, trash pile 69 for the rumble. All right. Well, we did it. We can move

373
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:33,319
on to act five and we get to watch my favorite cut scene. Did anything else? Let me... I know

374
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:53,050
canes here, but we did it. First cane. This is a great day indeed. Oh no. Holy shit. I'm gonna

375
01:20:53,050 --> 01:21:04,470
just get 50 subs. 50 community subs from Zyxia. Jesus.

376
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:16,869
Yes. Thanks so much. Seriously. That's a lot of fucking money. That's so much money.

377
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:20,710
I am honored that you would give it to me.

378
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:31,850
Best act, by the way, incoming. Act five D2 is awesome.

379
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:47,130
This place now. Thank you hero. Praise be to the light. Diablo and Mephisto have been

380
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:58,420
and big bits into the black abyss that spawned them and the corrupted soul stones are no more

381
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:05,590
bailing an army of hellish minions. Now this army is searching for the world stone ancient

382
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:11,369
source of all the soul stones and their power while leaving behind a wake destruction.

383
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:16,659
Yes. We're going to the barbarian homeland. Ben Eleanor gave the bits, by the way. I just wanted

384
01:22:16,659 --> 01:22:26,260
to wait till that was done talking. Ben Eleanor gave 5,000 bits. Thanks Ben. Seriously. It's

385
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:34,739
never, never necessary to ever give this channel these amounts of huge dollar signs. Thanks.

386
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:39,060
I hope you can afford it and I'm glad that you think it's worth paying for.

387
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:42,899
Thank you. They say, hey, I hope you're doing well. It's been a while since I caught one of

388
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:52,060
your streams. Thanks for being amazing. Thanks. I appreciate it. Scam Wink. It's already been paid

389
01:22:52,060 --> 01:23:06,619
for like five times. Backpack. Talking about my backpack. Let's identify these because it might

390
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:33,670
be anything. It might be good. No. Yes. Not an assassin. Well, we did it. Oops. All it took was

391
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:44,859
just buying up everybody's trash. Let's repair and let's watch. Let's watch one of my favorite

392
01:23:44,859 --> 01:26:04,310
cutscenes. Here we go. The gates of Cessaron have stood for eons beyond remembrance

393
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:13,829
and you shall not reach them now. Remove your foul demons from our lands. We stand on the side of

394
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:23,420
light and you shall not be allowed to reach Mount Ariat and that which you seek will not be yours.

395
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:47,239
Enough! Enough! Enough! I shall take your position into consideration.

396
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:33,829
Well, it seems your terms are not acceptable.

397
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:14,680
Bail. Best act. Best act. Best boss. Best villain. My voice is low because that was it. The audio

398
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:32,890
is incredibly loud. Best laugh. Best enough. We're in act five. Hooray. Currently under siege.

399
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:49,479
Best salad. Worst build. I have to say that was like a nine out of ten. Enough. It was.

400
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:04,840
I've been helpless to stop them. Bail is still out on the mountain looking for something.

401
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:25,739
Bail is looking for something. The world's stolen. Look, it's Otto. Best music. So first things first.

402
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:37,159
Let's, we're gonna say goodbye to our iron golem who's very, very good, but it's time to replace

403
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:48,170
with our fire golem. Fire golem just does more damage. Rest easy. Trash number 69.

404
01:29:50,579 --> 01:30:05,109
He's ready to be swept up into the great dumpster out behind the chilies. Goodbye. Farewell.

405
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:24,100
Shank the Overseer. This is coming up here. Wait, is this Diablo or Warcraft? What's the

406
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:32,659
difference? What is this? So let me help you out here.

407
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:42,100
Diablo one and two way better than Warcraft. Here it is. Diablo one and two better for me than

408
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:51,430
Warcraft three. Warcraft one and two way worse to me than Diablo one and two. Diablo three way worse

409
01:30:51,430 --> 01:31:01,130
than Warcraft one and two. They kind of switch. They swap. It's wrong. I mean, I have to disagree.

410
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:06,979
Diablo two is better than Warcraft three. I'm just gonna say it head to head, pound for pound. I think

411
01:31:06,979 --> 01:31:19,779
Diablo two is a better game. Although I'm biased because this is like, I love this game. I love

412
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:28,659
this franchise. So I'm pretty biased. Why is there just a shield in here? All right. Stop the siege

413
01:31:28,659 --> 01:31:33,000
by killing Shank the Overseer in the bloody foothills. We're going to have an army. This

414
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:46,260
should be pretty easy. I use that term pretty loosely. I do want to get Vic back. Oh, well,

415
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:49,140
I remember this guy. This guy. Spoiler alert. This guy.

416
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:32,550
We're both necromancers, man. Come on. A lot of lore here. I really do implore you to buy this.

417
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:48,489
No, I don't. It takes more than a siege to stop me. All right, get him.

418
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:54,489
I need Vic. I need Vic. The reason why I say is because the game doesn't really run that well.

419
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:58,649
You got to do a bunch of bullshit to get it to run. Blizzard does this really great thing where

420
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:03,369
they sell a game for $20 on their official website. And like the game can barely run on

421
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:10,359
like Windows 7 computers. It's cool. It's really cool. Like you have to download fucking third

422
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:16,149
party apps to get it to run the way it was supposed to run. $20, by the way,

423
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:34,260
on the official Blizzard shop. You need, uh, where is it? There it gets Qualkeck. There is

424
01:33:34,899 --> 01:33:44,979
Qualkeck. There you are. I am Qualkeck. We, all right, this is where we have to, no, no, no,

425
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:55,750
this is very important. Do we trade Vic's combat aura for a super strong, heavy melee damage

426
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:15,640
barbarian? Yeah, Vic just makes all the skeletons stronger. Barbarians are cool though.

427
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:24,460
Just fun to watch him use two hands and swing and shit. I love it. All right, let's get the army back.

428
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:43,189
They're not going to instantaneously die now. Also, I'm thinking of, uh,

429
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:56,039
thinking of doing a couple of Mephisto runs. Thinking about it. We need better gear.

430
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:01,260
I need it. All right, after shank the overseer, we're going to do, uh, at least one,

431
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:09,340
at least one Mephisto run. We're going to go, we're going to go open up the treasure box that

432
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:29,340
is Mephisto's body. I need all the help I can get. This is true. I got rid of my keys, right?

433
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:55,880
And we'll get in there, guys. Come on. I don't, don't go up too far. I get overwhelmed if I go

434
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:03,960
too far. I want a better spear for him. Everybody needs better stuff. He's got a unique, but it's an

435
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:12,789
old, unique level 17, 11 to 27 life steal. I mean, it's, it's just old. We're like level,

436
01:36:12,789 --> 01:36:17,909
how old is, how, not how old, what level is he? 29. We've got to get her something better than that.

437
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:41,260
Life still is really good for tanking. Yeah, it is. It is very good. What do you, what do you

438
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:45,260
get for doing this? I forget. I think you actually get a rune word. Yeah. It gives like

439
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:58,739
Rao or Tao. You get Kim the gifted prize. We have not gone to McDonald's. I've not given 10

440
01:36:58,739 --> 01:37:03,460
community fries to, uh, Kim yet. We have to go to McDonald's. The next time we go, I will.

441
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:25,239
He hates Kim. Everything they have, everything has to be hated.

442
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:42,119
We're good. Terrible. Skeleton friends are starting to die faster now. I don't like it.

443
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:52,069
We need better stuff. I'm definitely going on at least one. We need at least one more unique,

444
01:37:52,069 --> 01:38:22,539
one more set. Pretty good. What free full set do you get when you hit max level?

445
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:41,500
Well, that's very interesting. You don't. I'm affording Goblin.

446
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:57,500
Ooh, a wand. You know what? That's the problem with Diablo 3 now and Diablo 3 in general

447
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:09,619
is it was never about the journey. It was about the grind. It was just get max level

448
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:16,500
fast as possible. Get set to do max level riffs and just grind riffs until you have

449
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:26,810
your gem is max the fuck out. It was just, and you could, I guess you could argue that during

450
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:34,119
this game's heyday at the cow level was the same thing. But even when I first played through Diablo

451
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:45,159
3 and Reaper, it just felt, it just felt like a get to the grind, not necessarily like kill Diablo,

452
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:52,439
especially considering what they did with the Nephilim riffs. Like it was just log on and just

453
01:39:52,439 --> 01:40:05,640
watch white and yellow numbers explode on your screen. And that's it. Here comes a three hour

454
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:14,550
video essay. Oh no, it's, hey, there's Decrepify. It's a lot of cold resist. I should hold on to

455
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:31,850
this. Ooh, magic find. You're going to have a video essay with a YouTube video essay that's three

456
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:52,680
hours that has 14,000 views. Why is that so specific? That's so specific. That's all video

457
01:40:52,760 --> 01:41:21,270
essays. Don't want to die. Grand charm. Come on. Have it be a good one. Shit dog shit.

458
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:39,619
Just dog shit. Oh my God. How bad one to maximum damage. That's this is little brother levels of

459
01:41:39,619 --> 01:41:45,699
bad. Your little brother would have this on and he'd be like level 60 and he'd still have it on.

460
01:41:46,340 --> 01:42:03,449
That's what I forgot. I had jewelry slots. I picked that up already identified

461
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,739
or it went immediately into the slot. I didn't even put it there.

462
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:21,640
This way, this way, this way. I think I'm almost at the top. Get in there. All right, slow down.

463
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:33,430
All right, I'm going to get in the middle. We leveled up, level 30.

464
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:54,859
It's not in my inventory. Why? Where is it? Where'd it go? I think it also

465
01:42:55,819 --> 01:43:01,449
video essay incoming. The reason why I had so much fun with this game was

466
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:08,970
just miserably failing characters like trying to do a vengeance paladin.

467
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:19,899
It was just you could mess up. You could screw the fuck up in Diablo 2 and maybe you could still

468
01:43:19,899 --> 01:43:28,409
try to make it work. D3. It's just you made a barbarian and then I don't like this switch

469
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:34,470
switch switch. I can just use this one who cares. There were no stakes to your character.

470
01:43:36,069 --> 01:43:47,819
It was just here's everything. Use whatever you want. All right, here we go.

471
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:52,390
Video essay 2. All right, hold on. Shanks up here.

472
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:58,390
Every time I played this game when I was younger, I always had to say that out loud.

473
01:43:58,390 --> 01:44:01,590
Every time I got here, no matter how many times I've been here, I would go,

474
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:08,600
shank the ol' bustier every time I just did it again. God, I remember when I was younger.

475
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:25,909
Fireman's gonna die. This is a traffic jam. I need you up here, Fireman. I think these

476
01:44:25,909 --> 01:44:39,460
people can explode. I don't want to end it here. Speaking of careful, nothing. All right, kill them.

477
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:51,369
Yep, they can explode. This could end real fast. One wrong explosion. All right, let's get in.

478
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:26,840
Kill them. Shank. Burn. Ah, stupid gank. Larzok has the reward.

479
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:42,600
Oh yeah, if we're doing this, he will put a socket. This is one of the best rewards in the game.

480
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:59,399
First playthrough. First playthrough, Larry. First playthrough, Andy, whatever.

481
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,689
Oh cool, add sockets. I could use another one in here.

482
01:46:06,649 --> 01:46:19,079
Can you just waste it completely? I'm not going to use this. Even with the cold resist,

483
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:25,420
it's not very good. Maybe I'll hold on to it. All right, we've got some management to do.

484
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:44,890
We've got some management to do here. A lot of management. Oh boy, I have to sell this.

485
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:53,050
It's just, it's worthless to me. I was keeping this to, why was I keeping this?

486
01:46:53,050 --> 01:47:05,720
I was making a rune word, right? Am something thul? Holy fuck, that's a lot of resist.

487
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:18,739
Rid of the extra tier. If. Eld. F. F. Get rid of it. F. These things drop all the time.

488
01:47:18,739 --> 01:47:32,100
Rowl. Rowl. Rowl. Get rid of it. These flawed diamonds. Get rid of them. I just don't, I'm not,

489
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:39,479
get rid of them. They're taking up too much space. Anything flawed is out at this stage.

490
01:47:40,279 --> 01:47:52,420
We're keeping complete or higher only. All right, let's dump all this shit.

491
01:47:55,430 --> 01:48:16,579
Okay, if I organize this, I can make a flawless. I must have enough to make it perfect.

492
01:48:18,739 --> 01:48:31,430
Flawless amethyst. Always good. Still have the leg. Thul? If I have more than one thul,

493
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:47,720
I do. Get rid of it. Hey. All right, that's a lot of light and resist. That's why I'm keeping it.

494
01:48:47,720 --> 01:49:02,579
I need a rune word. What was the word? What was the rune word for this? Fire alarm? In all my years

495
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:13,750
playing Diablo II. Decades of time. I have never once thought that it was a smoke detector.

496
01:49:18,869 --> 01:49:28,470
Now I do, and now I can never un-hear that. But what was the word? What was it? It was am

497
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:47,340
something thul. Anyone remember? Am-ral-thul. I have it, right? Am-ral-thul. Oh, right,

498
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:50,460
because I was waiting to see if I could find something better than a war sword.

499
01:49:50,460 --> 01:50:06,439
If we just say fuck it and do it, who cares? I mean, war sword's pretty good. Am-ral-thul.

500
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:22,310
I'm doing it. It's am-ral-thul, right? Let me just look. I want to make sure I got this right.

501
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:39,619
I would hate to have this completely wrong. Okay, it's called King's Grace, right?

502
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,819
Am-ral-thul. Yep. All right, you ready? I don't have enough strength to use this,

503
01:50:48,819 --> 01:51:05,829
but I probably will eventually. Am-ral-thul. Boom. King's Grace. 16 to 40. A huge amount of

504
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:14,199
attack rating. Tons of damage to demons. Tons of damage to undead. Adds 5 to 30 fire. Adds 3 to

505
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:30,939
14 cold. Tons of health stolen for a hit. Pretty good. Pretty good. Some of you may have joined

506
01:51:30,939 --> 01:51:36,439
the stream very recently and are probably thinking to yourself, is this guy crazy?

507
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:42,600
He's- why are you- why are you doing this on a necromancer? Well, it's because I, um,

508
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:56,920
I have- I don't have any moves. I have teeth too. I don't have any abilities. Quick, do a flush.

509
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:14,569
That's stupid. All right, back up. I have- all right, let's move. The hard wall. I'm glad I beat

510
01:52:14,569 --> 01:52:24,649
Diablo. The actual wall. The true wall is going to be the Ancients. If you don't know what the

511
01:52:24,649 --> 01:52:33,720
Ancients are, the Ancients are- it's a boss encounter that you cannot leave. If you leave,

512
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:49,720
it resets. You have to do it in one shot. You cannot lose. So, and that's, unfortunately,

513
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:56,710
right at the end of the act. So, we're not going to know for certain. Oh wait, I was going to do

514
01:52:56,710 --> 01:53:21,619
Mephisto. Yeah, let's do that. Let's go kill Mephisto. Not that good. And also jump. All right,

515
01:53:21,619 --> 01:53:31,720
let's go do Mephisto. Let's pull this crew. Durance of Hate level two. Let's go. I already

516
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:49,850
know where it is. Glorious. It's up here. I wonder if this would be any easier now that I'm

517
01:53:50,409 --> 01:53:58,699
10 levels higher. What, 10? 15? Am I 30? 30? Yeah, what was I? I was like level 22 when I was here.

518
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:08,859
24 maybe. It's still probably going to be hard. Somebody's blocking the door.

519
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:22,949
All right. Are you getting out of the fucking doorway? Get out of the doorway. I have Fireman

520
01:54:22,949 --> 01:54:38,470
here to protect me. Yes, I do. I'm going to die to Mephisto. I'm only level 30. It's not like,

521
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:56,890
it's very possible. I have to be careful. You can drop shit. This desk is falling over here.

522
01:54:56,890 --> 01:55:21,000
There we go. These guys are still pretty dangerous. That just fucking hurt a lot.

523
01:55:27,619 --> 01:55:32,949
Don't run and pull. What are you guys thinking? You're just going to go pull Mephisto? You're

524
01:55:32,949 --> 01:55:55,260
going to get us all killed. All right. Come here, Mephisto. Get in there. Yeah, that's just going

525
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:15,399
fine. Burn them. Come on, Fire Golem. Stay alive. Make it clean. And something good.

526
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:37,079
I think I already have those boots. Oh, no, I don't. Seagulls. Sabot. Holders is 40.

527
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:48,090
Not enough strength. Do I have anything else for Seagulls? It's very fast. Plated belt. Don't I

528
01:56:48,090 --> 01:57:01,340
have? Do I have something else for Seagulls? I don't think so. Now you can finally go kill

529
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:23,930
Duriel. Yeah. All right. That was fun. Good again. No, I have, I have Catan's. These normal little

530
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:27,449
early game sets, though, if you get two or three pieces, it actually is really good.

531
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:33,449
They have a lot of good bonuses. Let's start from the beginning.

532
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:38,789
Impossible. Let's try to sell the cube. I'm glad you can't do that.

533
01:57:39,590 --> 01:58:08,649
Barrens of Hate level two. Again. No, don't pick up blood. My army. We're back. Back in business.

534
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:23,979
Let's go. Get hit right in the head. Do I have potions?

535
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:39,130
Get caught up here. I gotta get potions. That hurts. Yeah, I need.

536
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:53,159
Even if they're shitty, I don't care. Yes. No, just get the good ones. Just get the good ones.

537
01:58:59,909 --> 01:59:07,500
The best part of this game is that it is not Warcraft remastered.

538
01:59:19,609 --> 01:59:25,739
Uh, I guess, I guess I follow you. I think I, I pick up what you're putting down here.

539
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:36,600
Reforged. Reforged. It's not, hey, it wasn't, it's not a remaster.

540
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:45,399
That's where you guys got it all wrong. It was reforged. That means that's a made-up term

541
01:59:45,960 --> 02:00:06,409
that it could mean anything. It's not Warcraft remade or remake remastered. No, it's reforged.

542
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:14,170
I thought you guys got that when we announced it. Oh, by the way,

543
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:20,229
you can never play the original ever again. We had to, we reforged the damn thing.

544
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:48,859
We didn't teleport, did we? Fireman died. Poor Fireman. Gave up. Again, here let's go.

545
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:56,149
Hey, Mephisto, remember us? We're here. We're here for the diamonds. We're here for the jewels.

546
02:00:57,109 --> 02:01:41,100
I just get to watch. It's not even worth picking up. We're gonna do it five times.

547
02:01:41,659 --> 02:01:52,439
This'll be number three. And then we'll go, we'll do the next quest in Act 5. We'll do this five

548
02:01:52,439 --> 02:02:04,119
times. Man, the times that I wish I was a sorceress. One of them is right now. It's boom,

549
02:02:04,119 --> 02:02:15,609
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Exit game. Enter game. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

550
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:39,050
Exit game. Enter game. All righty, people. Careful.

551
02:02:40,010 --> 02:03:05,029
Easy. The mages just died so quickly. These mages are getting beat up. You guys dead? Come on,

552
02:03:05,029 --> 02:03:18,539
guys. Clean it up a little bit here. This is embarrassing. The same hardcore run it is.

553
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:29,239
It is still hardcore. I've not died yet on this character. All that could change in an instant.

554
02:03:37,979 --> 02:04:03,000
Okay, let's go. Look, I'm helping this time. Okay, so I just dropped a meteor.

555
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:26,819
Hold on here. Hold on here. It's getting a little hairy. Not clean. Not clean. Heavy boots. Boots

556
02:04:26,819 --> 02:04:44,680
again? Sanders. 40%. These are actually kind of good. Sanders riprap. These are really good

557
02:04:44,680 --> 02:05:00,010
actually. Do I have anything else from Sanders? I'm gonna put these on. 40% faster run. Bunch of

558
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:16,920
strength in decks. Oh my god, I fucking vroom. Don't I already have? Yeah, I have stealth too.

559
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:23,989
Well, I can do this faster now. Yeah. Why am I not opening the chest back here? Why has nobody

560
02:05:23,989 --> 02:05:31,220
corrected me? Where are all the Diablo 2 veterans in here that should be correcting me to get the

561
02:05:31,220 --> 02:06:00,100
chest back here? Because it could be unique. I remember being like a Sunday afternoon and I

562
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:14,619
was on my like 40th Mephisto run. I had a fresh Mountain Dew Code Red. I was just in my element.

563
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:27,579
It was just so much fun. It was in my element. Somebody would come into the room,

564
02:06:28,779 --> 02:06:34,199
spam a Diablo 2 item scam website 10 times, and then instantly leave.

565
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:56,890
Ugh, those are the days. Oh my god, don't die. Reminiscing is gonna kill me. I do, I remember.

566
02:06:56,890 --> 02:07:04,630
I remember having to have a password protected private game or every 10 seconds a new account

567
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:11,449
that was a keyboard smash name would come in and talk about how much percent off their wind forces

568
02:07:11,449 --> 02:07:36,699
were. I remember also, God bless my mother. God bless my mother because I remember being like

569
02:07:36,699 --> 02:07:49,029
15 and wanting to buy a wind force and I was trying to explain to my mother why I had to

570
02:07:49,109 --> 02:08:01,239
have this thing. And she just shook her head and said, that is absurd. You don't need that.

571
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:16,460
And I was like, no, but I do, but my character, come on. And she refused to do it. It didn't

572
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:21,420
matter how much I was like, no, but mom, by the way, I was 15, not like six. So I don't know why

573
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:36,630
I'm doing like a come on mommy voice. I was like fucking a teenager. I was like 15. I was, I was,

574
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:57,210
I had to have been fucking like, oh no, stop, stop, stop, stop. Where's my fire friend?

575
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:32,630
Hold on. I just need to never talk ever again. Um, my mom, I was a teenager at the time.

576
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:43,829
She told me it wasn't worth it and it was a stupid thing to do. To buy this item from the

577
02:09:43,829 --> 02:10:19,979
Diablo 2 scam website. Your mom had a big brain. I think a wind force, wind force was like,

578
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:29,060
don't die. I think a wind force was like 200 bucks. It's crazy. Oh, wait, that's actually a head.

579
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:35,560
They were expensive. They were like more than a hundred bucks or something. They had to have

580
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:53,590
been. I remember freedom life tap. Oh, hooray. One more. You were a pretty stupid 15 year old.

581
02:10:55,130 --> 02:11:00,020
Um, no, just the wind force was one of the hardest things to get in the whole game.

582
02:11:01,539 --> 02:11:10,310
Wind force was just the unobtainable. It was that one bow that was the best bow.

583
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:19,350
All it would have done would be to let me to use strafe and kill cows faster.

584
02:11:19,909 --> 02:11:34,649
That's all I was doing. So in 2020 hindsight, no, it definitely was not worth it. I just wanted

585
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:42,539
to be able to farm because I wanted to find the runes. Yep. It was to be able to farm cows.

586
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:56,060
All right, this is the last one. It's 55 cents now. I would not put my credit card into a website

587
02:11:56,060 --> 02:12:13,739
still selling Diablo 2 items for 50 cents. I don't think that would be a good idea for me.

588
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:28,300
Come on, man. It's a steel. It's a wind force.

589
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:38,920
Oh, fuck. I can't let this be on the tombstone.

590
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:47,529
I'd rather die to the ancients than die farming Mephisto. That's embarrassing on the tombstone.

591
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:21,960
Yo, they're gonna be a pain in the ass still. All right, let's get council number two.

592
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:35,289
Your mom probably bought the wind forces and got you banned. My account wasn't banned until recently.

593
02:13:36,489 --> 02:13:47,050
Played Diablo 2 a year ago. Just installed it to check it out for the first time in a while.

594
02:13:54,710 --> 02:14:06,500
What you think? You think my mother now did this? My mother in 2020? That would be sort of strange.

595
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:16,579
Mom trying to get my account banned. Mom got my account banned. That's like a YouTube video.

596
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:26,039
Guys, my mom sold gold on my Warcraft account banned.

597
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:45,029
Come on, give us a unique. This is five times. I've spun the slot machine five times. I want something.

598
02:14:45,989 --> 02:15:10,420
Give me something. Ouch. One more. That one didn't count. All blues doesn't count.

599
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:31,720
Jesus, that was stupid.

600
02:15:36,649 --> 02:15:58,899
Where are my friends? I'm about to exit the game. It's because there's a champion in here.

601
02:15:59,699 --> 02:16:14,550
Wait, were there two champions? What the fuck? You guys didn't kill it? All right, well look, come on.

602
02:16:16,859 --> 02:16:41,260
Let's go. Big co-op juke. Nice. Nice. That's what I like to see. Follow me.

603
02:16:41,739 --> 02:16:51,940
All right, let's go. I can run faster than them. I can run faster than them. Just run.

604
02:16:53,450 --> 02:17:27,639
I have super speed. Use it. All right, now slow down. Do I have any healing potions?

605
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:31,579
I think I have to go back to town. All right, let's see if I can just do this without getting hit.

606
02:17:34,809 --> 02:17:59,750
Just don't get hit. Just don't get hit. All there is to it. Let me adjust the boomer belt. Adjust it.

607
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:21,700
Just. Also terrible. Let's go. Last one. No matter what happens is it. Who cares. It'll be it. No more.

608
02:18:26,540 --> 02:19:09,579
Everybody in attacking me. Don't do that. Ow. And unique. Ah, no. I can't do it again. No, I can't.

609
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:32,540
I'm just gonna get there very quickly. Hold on.

610
02:19:38,329 --> 02:20:00,500
Maybe I should change it up. Should I do Undariel or something? Player count?

611
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:15,100
Yeah, but that's dangerous though. I'll do players. Players four. You can call me a

612
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:24,489
coward or you won. I mean, there's eight. Let's see if players four. If I can do players four, then I'll

613
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:38,440
keep going. Dude, and this is gonna be. No, no, no, no. Bad idea. That's a really, really bad idea right

614
02:20:38,440 --> 02:21:07,180
now. No, no, that's so bad. Players 200. Let's go. I'm just gonna try it around there. I have a no

615
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:29,590
shit button. Almost there. Good. No, uh, no little guys to screw it all up. Here we are. Now we're

616
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:41,319
gonna take this slow. I can't hurt these guys. I'm gonna be solely reliant on the companions,

617
02:21:41,319 --> 02:21:58,579
which has to be like that anyways. Footstep sounds kill me. I can't even hear footsteps on.

618
02:21:58,579 --> 02:22:17,100
Oh, no, I do. Yeah, I do. It's like, damn, I don't appreciate your passive aggressive tone, Jerma.

619
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:49,940
What the fuck are you talking about? Players four. Where is it? Jerma's weird. I mean, yeah,

620
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:59,659
kind of am. Whatever. I don't think I'm that weird. I don't think I'd do anything that out

621
02:22:59,659 --> 02:23:15,610
of the ordinary that a normal person wouldn't wouldn't do. That's what they all say. Yeah.

622
02:23:16,409 --> 02:23:30,379
So what? That's true. Just in case I die. I can't, I, I, I, I, I'm dead if I die. There is no coming

623
02:23:30,379 --> 02:23:40,629
back. I got to heal the, uh, I got to heal Vic. Come back here. Vic is healed. Stay the fuck out

624
02:23:40,629 --> 02:23:55,180
of the way. He's going to one by one take out every skeleton. He's going to kill. It's gonna

625
02:23:55,180 --> 02:24:21,239
take a while. Why are you killing this guy in one hit? Vic, you good? Just Vic, you just do it.

626
02:24:21,239 --> 02:24:36,950
You'll be fine. I think he's healing himself. Use it now. He's got that pole. He goes down.

627
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:41,350
There it is. Heal him. Oh my God. He's fucking gonna die.

628
02:24:47,940 --> 02:25:08,659
Kill him. I can press shift. Yeah, that's right. Come on, Vic. All right. Unique.

629
02:25:09,379 --> 02:25:27,909
Get some bad luck here. Usually you get like one. Usually you get one unique. I just had to

630
02:25:27,909 --> 02:25:35,559
stretch for that one. That's it. I'm not doing another one. I'm not doing another Mephisto run.

631
02:25:35,559 --> 02:25:40,760
That's it. No more Mephisto runs. Didn't say anything about not doing an Andariel run.

632
02:25:41,319 --> 02:26:01,370
That runs so fast.

633
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:50,280
Okay, minor mana potions. All right, get in here. Uh, Andariel is going to be pretty easy.

634
02:26:53,190 --> 02:27:03,379
Should be. Do I not have any magic find? I, I do not really, but it's hard to get at this stage.

635
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:08,840
I could make a moonward maybe with that magic find on it. I think I have like

636
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:15,319
20-30%. You need like, you need to have more than 100% to really do runs efficiently.

637
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:33,180
But I don't have any. I'm just trying to do it straight up. Shit. Thought it was a different

638
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:46,440
rune. Oh well. All right, let's go get her. Hello. Killer. He's like already almost dead.

639
02:27:47,399 --> 02:27:54,219
All right, Andariel. Drop a unique. You dropped so much shit and none of it's a unique.

640
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:17,620
It's all like level eight. Level four. Player count, player counts at four. I could do eight.

641
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:22,579
I could do player count eight with Andariel. You know what? Let's do that. Let's just do that.

642
02:28:22,579 --> 02:28:46,250
Let's do that right now. Player's eight. Definitely can do eight plays with Andariel.

643
02:28:46,250 --> 02:29:20,500
That shouldn't be a problem. Just to hope it's not. Easy. Okay. Oh, we're fine. Can I get it?

644
02:29:21,299 --> 02:29:48,020
Good. I'm fast. Best part about a unique, it doesn't matter what act or where in the game

645
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:54,500
you find it. Well, not entirely true. But for all the normal uniques, they could drop anywhere.

646
02:29:55,299 --> 02:29:58,950
There are a lot of uniques that only drop in Nightmare in Hell difficulty, but

647
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:03,590
it's not like I'm going to get like a level two unique. That sucks. All uniques are pretty good

648
02:30:04,549 --> 02:30:16,389
for the most part. Open the door. I mean, in normal, like if you're like level 20, level 30,

649
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:21,909
level 40, a lot of normal uniques can carry you. I mean, take a look. I've had this on the whole

650
02:30:21,909 --> 02:30:35,159
time. I've had this on since level 10. I haven't taken it off. I haven't needed to. All right.

651
02:30:35,159 --> 02:30:41,340
Eight players. I'm about scared. I was when I first came in here. What did I have? Three

652
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:54,819
skeletons. That's not even a challenge. Not even a challenge. Unique. If everybody in the chat says

653
02:30:54,819 --> 02:31:05,430
it at the same time, it might happen. Everybody in the chat say unique. Nobody. You guys didn't say

654
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:58,790
it. Not enough people said it. Oh no. We failed you. Hello. Do a Diablo run. Impossible. Let's go.

655
02:31:58,790 --> 02:32:15,989
Mephisto. Done. Coming back to act five. Last one. Truly, truly the final one. Truly with certainty.

656
02:32:15,989 --> 02:32:25,500
And then we'll do the next part of act five.

657
02:32:46,149 --> 02:32:47,590
Make me laugh, E-clown.

658
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:24,569
No, you have to do a joke now. No, I don't want to. I don't want to. No, I'm okay.

659
02:33:24,809 --> 02:33:42,840
Let's play a game. I gotta level up from doing this. That should be good. Gotta power up the

660
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:57,909
funny crystal. My funny crystal. Pull up from this. Whoa. That's bad. That's lower resist all.

661
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:11,659
No, he killed everybody. That's one you don't want to see. That's not a good one. You don't

662
02:34:11,659 --> 02:34:21,590
want to see that pop up. Weaken. Resist lower. It sucks. Still not anything here though. Let's go

663
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:39,000
this way. It's locked. When he said Diablo resident sleeper. Opening up the box is the most

664
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:49,620
interesting thing you've ever seen. And you mean to tell me that killing Mephisto seven times in

665
02:34:49,620 --> 02:35:00,860
a row is not the most exciting thing in the world. Oh, you get to see like yellow text hit the ground.

666
02:35:01,819 --> 02:35:18,440
What are you talking about? All right. Just keep a big alive. Amateur hour. Only seven.

667
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:33,110
This should level up. You finally get to pick something because you picked the least entertaining

668
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:44,180
play style. I didn't pick. Probably should have put that in the title. This is not going to do

669
02:35:44,180 --> 02:36:32,149
with me. No, don't die. Stay alive. Oh, well. Level nine. Get the fuck out of here with this shit.

670
02:36:32,149 --> 02:36:51,000
Level nine? Level three? This is act three. All right. Take a look. That's not correct. That's

671
02:36:51,000 --> 02:37:05,860
the runeword website. Those are the cheats. Okay. That's better. Wait. No, it's not because I remember

672
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:09,219
we had to zoom in. I didn't even click this either. What the hell am I thinking?

673
02:37:09,860 --> 02:37:23,209
Let me fix this. All right, guys. Pick the next point, please. Make it a good one.

674
02:37:24,090 --> 02:38:16,840
What do you want to do? Please choose wisely. Okay. Revive. I didn't. I'm surprised. I thought,

675
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:27,319
okay. Somebody said, I want the one that looks like a big poop. None of the three of these that

676
02:38:27,319 --> 02:38:38,200
have been clicked remotely resemble that. Not even close. Which one of these are you looking at?

677
02:38:39,079 --> 02:38:54,180
Okay. We're doing revive. Pretty good choice. Thanks for voting. Now, what about this?

678
02:38:55,299 --> 02:39:19,819
Bunny Poo Poo streamer. Omega Low. No, it's Bunny Poo Poo chat members. How much do I actually have

679
02:39:19,819 --> 02:39:51,670
strength? Okay. Strength it is. Strength it is. I can now use that sword and I can use the

680
02:39:51,670 --> 02:40:04,149
something else too with 70, right? What else is 70? Something else is 70. Is revive.

681
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:25,350
I need to put that on the bar. Let's do, let's see. F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 can be revived.

682
02:40:25,989 --> 02:40:34,920
So revive does this. You'll see in just a second. See these guys? He's Blood Lord.

683
02:40:35,879 --> 02:40:44,940
When he dies, I have Blood Lord. They have the same moves. They do everything the exact same,

684
02:40:44,940 --> 02:41:10,860
except they're yours. Very, very useful. All right. It's time to continue to play the game

685
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:18,569
after a pee break and go for about three hours. Let's, let's take a break. I'll be back in like

686
02:41:18,569 --> 02:46:27,829
two minutes, three minutes. Let us continue. Oh, the last thing we did was the Virgin of

687
02:46:27,829 --> 02:46:35,350
Island. We have a revive. Where is he? There he is. See? Isn't he cool? He just like floats around

688
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:59,319
and it could be anybody. It could be anyone. Oh, my sword. I'll get it in a second. Oh, he's dead?

689
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:09,340
Oh my God. They're getting stomped. We have strength in numbers, not individual strength.

690
02:47:10,059 --> 02:47:29,510
Come on, guys. Somebody kill somebody. Oh, damn it. I thought it was going to be good.

691
02:47:31,450 --> 02:47:41,770
Doesn't look very good. Oh, for the love of God, it's on players eight.

692
02:47:42,569 --> 02:47:55,180
It's like, why are we getting our asses kicked? This shouldn't be happening.

693
02:47:55,180 --> 02:48:37,909
What? Did it get this much harder? All right. Now we got the whole crew. Let's go. All right.

694
02:48:37,909 --> 02:48:51,860
Two players. I too live in an evil demon hut. We'll get, we'll get the heck out of there.

695
02:48:52,899 --> 02:49:22,120
We got a big guy now. Let that guy out. Why? Oh, find the soldiers in the Virgin of Highland.

696
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:25,639
So there are soldiers locked up that we have to find and help and rescue.

697
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:42,149
Need to rescue them. A battle going on. Oh, man. I can't even tell who's friend or foe right now.

698
02:49:42,149 --> 02:49:55,159
All right. Time to go back. Do you think he realizes how dumb he is? What? By doing what?

699
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:10,620
I normally might agree with you, but what are we talking about? Can I do the cow level?

700
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:18,579
Cause I'm winning because I've beaten Diablo. Wait, I don't think he would. What do you mean?

701
02:50:18,579 --> 02:50:31,139
He doesn't realize. What do you mean? What did I do? What happened? It needs to be Bill.

702
02:50:35,719 --> 02:50:54,870
Do you, is it Diablo or Bill? He just doesn't get it. Oh, I guess not. I need to have potions.

703
02:50:56,709 --> 02:51:08,010
Potions please. Potions please. Thank you. He just doesn't get it. I wish we could make him see.

704
02:51:15,270 --> 02:51:41,559
Oh, 46 to 121 versus 37 to 106. A shitload of everything else. This can now go away. I can

705
02:51:41,639 --> 02:51:58,379
use this, but why would I? He's a much better. We could make him understand.

706
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:20,520
If only we could just make him understand. See? Right there.

707
02:52:26,250 --> 02:52:32,469
I'm just going to pretend like you guys are just making a joke and you're trying to get me to go,

708
02:52:32,469 --> 02:52:34,950
what are you talking about? Which is what already happened. So you already did it.

709
02:52:35,909 --> 02:52:37,510
You've already done it. You did a good job.

710
02:52:40,979 --> 02:52:48,889
Saved one. I need two more. Two more soldier

711
02:52:50,489 --> 02:53:14,579
prisons. Two more. Difficulty. I mean, I have it on players too. I mean, it's extra experience

712
02:53:14,579 --> 02:53:23,049
and we can handle it. We can handle it. You haven't changed the difficulty. I changed it twice.

713
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:46,819
What? Yes, I did. I forgot the slash the first time. Didn't I put it on two

714
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:55,159
after four? I fixed it. At least I thought I did. You never set it to four.

715
02:53:59,239 --> 02:54:13,079
I still like it. Another camp right here. Let's get it. Breathe. Oh shit. Hold on. That's death.

716
02:54:13,959 --> 02:54:37,610
I want the big guy. Hey, Vic leveled up. Good. My mana is so bad. It's just bad. All right. That's

717
02:54:37,610 --> 02:54:58,489
a unique. That's a... One more. All right. Kill this champion, please. I have 100% more damage

718
02:54:58,489 --> 02:55:07,829
to demons. Look at how much I'm melting this guy. Did you see that? I have 100% more damage to demons

719
02:55:07,829 --> 02:55:15,340
and undead. I may as well be unkillable. I may as well have put it on players

720
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:22,260
50 because there's no way I'm going to lose ever again. I mean, like, geez, it's just not fair.

721
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:38,780
I just uninstall the game. I'm looking for another prison. Looking for another prison.

722
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:56,520
Yell if you see one. I don't think it would be that much further down than this.

723
02:55:56,520 --> 02:56:20,309
I thought it could be. How am I this powerful? You struggle with the necro on normal?

724
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:40,069
I'm not sure I am. I mean, I'm pretty weak, to be honest. Abaddon. Just a random dungeon.

725
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:46,729
I'm not looking for Abaddon, though. We're looking for another... We're looking for another

726
02:56:47,850 --> 02:56:50,569
barbarian camp, which for some reason we can't find.

727
02:56:50,569 --> 02:57:08,940
I'm so fast. I can just ski around at, like, 75% extra speed. No, it's definitely down.

728
02:57:10,059 --> 02:57:21,350
It's definitely not this far up. What's my favorite PS2 game?

729
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:40,250
Uh, I don't know. That's a pretty good question. I have no idea. I don't have any idea.

730
02:57:41,209 --> 02:57:56,790
Tony Hawk's Underground? No. I don't know. That's what you get in, like, an hour.

731
02:57:57,510 --> 02:58:13,930
Maybe I'll be able to come up with something then. All right. Barbarian camp. Barbarian camp.

732
02:58:19,819 --> 02:58:27,049
I thought I would have bet all my chips that it was right there. I would have lost all my chips.

733
02:58:28,649 --> 02:58:34,170
And then I would have fucking slowly been like, okay, cool. Thanks for the game. Thanks for the

734
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:41,989
game, guys. And I'd just slowly get up from the chair and go to my car. Yep. Bye-bye. See you later.

735
02:58:41,989 --> 02:58:49,540
Fun night. And the door closed in the car. And I'd be like, haha, let's go home.

736
02:58:52,950 --> 02:59:09,219
Just fucking, just bullsh- scream. What's my favorite chip? Fake Blaze.

737
02:59:10,739 --> 02:59:18,469
You're doing the YouTuber voice at the poker table. You deserve to lose your chips.

738
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:28,069
I didn't go into the poker table or like the blackjack table and be like, okay, sounds good.

739
02:59:29,799 --> 02:59:34,040
So what's that, 11? I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to double down on that one.

740
02:59:35,219 --> 02:59:53,719
It would be like, shut the fuck up. I'm sorry? Oh, so I can't hear you. The YouTuber voice.

741
02:59:53,719 --> 02:59:59,399
Where is this other barbarian camp? Or should I say, where is this other barbarian camp?

742
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:06,329
Let me try, I'll translate it. I'll translate everything into YouTube for you guys.

743
03:00:06,329 --> 03:00:46,760
Just in case anyone didn't know. Where is anybody? Bring back the voice actor frog.

744
03:00:49,340 --> 03:01:02,840
I don't think I could do that. I'm not sure we'll see him again. He didn't, he did not like,

745
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:12,899
he was not happy on that stream. He was very angry with me. I apparently, I quote, put him on the

746
03:01:12,899 --> 03:01:34,139
spot. And he said, it would be as if I called you to come over my house to stream from my house

747
03:01:34,139 --> 03:02:03,290
on my channel as you. And I laughed in his face. Don't call me ever again. Retell the joke,

748
03:02:03,290 --> 03:02:10,899
I missed it. Yeah. But that frog actor is not going to come back. Weirdly enough,

749
03:02:11,860 --> 03:02:31,139
when's Bugleberry coming back? When he makes his album called Scare and Through the 70s.

750
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:41,370
10 hits sung by Bugleberry himself of his own writing based on original characters he wrote

751
03:02:41,930 --> 03:02:57,399
and drew. He drew these characters on his paper like he like artists that draw and drew them.

752
03:03:06,520 --> 03:03:09,719
I need to find these barbarians before I lose my mind.

753
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:21,690
No, I want this guy. I don't want you. Come on. Barbarians. Barbarians. I need one more.

754
03:03:22,329 --> 03:03:56,409
Where are they? Bugleberry. Bugleberry. Give me this way. Bugleberry sucks. No, he doesn't.

755
03:03:57,129 --> 03:04:09,110
I can't believe you guys didn't like him. He was so sad. Hey, hey, hey. He made his $40.

756
03:04:10,069 --> 03:04:32,780
Okay. And when I handed him the money, I gave him two 20s. He was like, two 20s. Whoa, whoa,

757
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:38,389
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He was like really fucking VIP. Excited about it. It was like he'd

758
03:04:38,389 --> 03:04:49,670
never seen that much money before in his life. It was really weird. I mean, I can't do the impression

759
03:04:49,670 --> 03:04:59,620
well, but you know. And he called me from his car and he asked me if I still had one of the 20s.

760
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:08,420
I said no. He said, I'll do my best here. Well, I only have one. Are you sure?

761
03:05:09,219 --> 03:05:13,459
Somewhere along the way, he lost one of the 20s. I don't know how. We put them both in the same

762
03:05:13,459 --> 03:05:21,639
pocket. I don't understand. It was within five minutes of me handing it to him. And I'm like,

763
03:05:21,639 --> 03:05:40,149
dude, I paid you. I can't. I'm not going to give you another 20. And then he called again

764
03:05:40,149 --> 03:05:44,629
that night and he asked, he had, he just real quick wanted me to ask me what kind of dog I had.

765
03:05:44,629 --> 03:05:49,319
What was the breed? I don't think he was under the assumption that he was going to buy a dog with

766
03:05:49,319 --> 03:06:04,979
$40 for 20. He's a weird guy. All right. Got them all. That's good.

767
03:06:25,799 --> 03:06:37,739
He just wanted a puppy. We've been hating on him.

768
03:06:37,739 --> 03:06:52,819
You're so mean. Bugleberry is a good person. I cannot speak to Bugleberry's character.

769
03:06:52,819 --> 03:07:01,399
The guy carries around urns of demons and shit. You know how long it took after the Halloween

770
03:07:01,399 --> 03:07:25,049
stream to get that fucking thing back inside of its dwelling. An hour? No.

771
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:37,510
Probably three weeks. This motherfucker put on like costumes and was running around,

772
03:07:37,510 --> 03:07:44,790
was going to the bank and shit. We had to tail him in his Bugleberry's fucking shitty old car.

773
03:07:53,159 --> 03:08:25,299
Fucking stupid. Maybe you should check in with him sometimes. Oh, don't worry. He checks in with me

774
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:40,340
all the time actually. And I answer the phone every time and we talk because we're fucking

775
03:08:40,340 --> 03:09:08,940
old friends. I love Bugleberry. He's the best. You know, I've got this great, great plan for Bugleberry.

776
03:09:11,620 --> 03:09:22,659
I can't wait. It's going to be awesome. I cannot wait. If only I could tell you.

777
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:39,110
If only I could tell you what the plan is for Bugleberry. A lot of you would actually probably

778
03:09:39,110 --> 03:10:05,000
really have. Because I am. We lack critical information.

779
03:10:09,399 --> 03:10:28,389
I have big bits. Oh, freak out. Freak. How many times did you do this? One, two, three,

780
03:10:28,389 --> 03:10:40,020
four. Did you just give two, what, a hundred dollars? All right. Freak out just gave

781
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:52,760
a hundred dollars worth of bits. There's a lot of information here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

782
03:10:52,920 --> 03:11:04,819
This is, this is confusing me. First of all, thanks for the hundred dollars.

783
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:11,780
Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few years. Have you ever seen a professional RC car race?

784
03:11:12,500 --> 03:11:19,350
I have not. Here you go. Speaking of cars, when was the last time you worked on your car? I don't.

785
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:24,040
I know it might seem like a steep hill to climb, but I've been working for a Honda as a technician

786
03:11:24,040 --> 03:11:30,629
for a few months now. Why do I feel like this is not real? I don't think this is, I don't know,

787
03:11:30,629 --> 03:11:39,450
I don't think this is real. I think this is made up. I can guide you along the way. The

788
03:11:39,450 --> 03:11:44,200
following is a list of things anybody can check without having to buy any, any expensive tools.

789
03:11:44,200 --> 03:11:51,000
Wiper blades, washer fluid, engine filter and cabin AC filter, battery terminals, drive belt,

790
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:58,889
front rear brake pads, tire tread, transmission fluid. I'm not going to do any of this. No,

791
03:11:58,889 --> 03:12:05,780
I just drop it off and I say, please fix my car, sir. And then they charge me $1,500 for like,

792
03:12:06,420 --> 03:12:17,510
that's what I do. Anti-freeze power steering fluid, tire pressure. If you find any of these

793
03:12:17,510 --> 03:12:20,870
are in need of any attention or replacement, you should bring it to a local dealership or

794
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:24,860
certified mechanic. Or if you want, you can try to replace it yourself. Hey, that would be a great

795
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:29,899
idea for a stream. Or if you do decide to do it yourself, you should take any and all precautions,

796
03:12:29,899 --> 03:12:39,450
even after working on cars for almost a year. The smell of these fluids will make me gag.

797
03:12:39,450 --> 03:13:02,520
You motherfucker, you motherfucker. I don't think I'm going to be, I don't think I'm going to be

798
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:12,739
uh, reading any more messages from Mr. Freakout. I think, uh, I think we've, I think we've hit the

799
03:13:12,739 --> 03:13:25,270
wall here talking about the codes. Uh, I'm not, I'm not going to give any more codes.

800
03:13:25,909 --> 03:13:43,340
This is the porn guy, by the way, for those of you that are curious, the porn guy. I will answer

801
03:13:43,340 --> 03:13:49,579
this one question though. I will give this to you. Uh, they want to ask how many towels I use on a

802
03:13:49,579 --> 03:14:03,750
weekly basis. One. Showering. I mean, that's a weird question, but I mean, one. I think, uh,

803
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:14,709
God damn it, man. What the flying fuck. Who uses one towel? One for every, no, one for like,

804
03:14:14,709 --> 03:14:20,540
showering. I don't know. What does that mean? How many towels do you use on a weekly basis? Like,

805
03:14:20,540 --> 03:14:27,110
what, if I go to a pool, I'll use an extra towel. If I, like, yeah, I don't know. I use one towel

806
03:14:27,110 --> 03:14:41,610
a week every like three or four days, replace a towel. That's normal. You use a towel to wash

807
03:14:41,610 --> 03:14:47,159
your dishes and a shower. No, we, we're not, we, we have not, you're playing semantics now.

808
03:14:47,719 --> 03:14:56,059
Like, I'm thinking of how many towels I use in the bath, like tub. I use one towel to like

809
03:14:56,059 --> 03:15:02,790
shower, get out, dry off. Three, four days will go by, use another one. You got to conserve water.

810
03:15:02,950 --> 03:15:10,010
You're going to just, you're going to wash a towel every day? You made the second part up.

811
03:15:10,010 --> 03:15:18,629
What do you mean? What? That's two. He doesn't wash dishes. No, you use a different towel. Okay,

812
03:15:19,350 --> 03:15:24,600
there's a dish towel. There's a bath towel. These are two, they're two separate entities

813
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:30,680
that they're used for different things. Okay, I use a dish towel. One. You know, who, why are we

814
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:41,110
even talking about this? Uh, thank you, freak out for the hunt, for like the $500 in porn messages

815
03:15:42,069 --> 03:15:48,540
and the tips on cars. But I'm sad to say I'm not, I'm not going, I will not be reading

816
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:56,329
one of your messages again. That's, that, that you, you popped out to the pitcher on this last

817
03:15:56,329 --> 03:16:10,250
message. You popped out to the pitcher and he caught it. You swung it right in the air and it

818
03:16:10,250 --> 03:16:16,440
was caught. You're out. You're out. That's it. I really appreciate it though, but you're out.

819
03:16:17,079 --> 03:16:54,260
No, all right. You, you, you can, you link a bunch of porn codes twice, two different times.

820
03:16:54,260 --> 03:17:01,299
And the third time you reference explicitly the porn codes that strike three men.

821
03:17:01,940 --> 03:17:28,280
At some point you got to strike out. That's why he's naked. Um, oh yeah. This is on hardcore. I

822
03:17:28,280 --> 03:17:58,659
can't do that. What kind of weirdo would wear a backpack and a t-shirt?

823
03:18:01,459 --> 03:18:10,329
Some of you new viewers don't get it. No. All right. I have to stand up guys. I'm wearing a

824
03:18:10,329 --> 03:18:38,819
boomer brace. See, I'm wearing a backpack and a fanny cap, a fanny pack. And you know, and you

825
03:18:38,819 --> 03:19:17,459
know it. You know it. It's right there. Oh, oh, oh, oh, the bionic boomer. Another one? Really?

826
03:19:18,260 --> 03:19:24,659
That was just like a bug. I can't even do it. Yeah. I've done it. Okay. I have to wink too

827
03:19:24,659 --> 03:19:34,819
many times. I can't, I don't know how to do it anymore. These are scam winks. Whatever. I want

828
03:19:34,819 --> 03:20:01,000
to do, I want to turn this in. I think the wink experience has been a, has been a failure.

829
03:20:01,959 --> 03:20:13,059
Has it? Oh, I got a ring. Oh no, he gave me Raal-Ort-Tal. Raal-Ort-Tal. If only I had a

830
03:20:13,059 --> 03:20:19,989
shock and a shield. That's what he says. Uh, look for Anya under the crystalline passage by the

831
03:20:19,989 --> 03:20:26,260
frozen river. Anya is one of the townspeople here. She's trapped in ice. 100,000 points to show Otto.

832
03:20:26,260 --> 03:20:33,750
No, I'm not gonna like drag my dog in here. I'm not gonna like channel point my dog into the room

833
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:38,840
and like pick him up. And no, that's like not, I don't want to do that to him. That's not nice.

834
03:20:40,389 --> 03:20:45,829
Hey Otto, somebody gave a 10,000, 100,000 points. Come here. You look at the camera.

835
03:20:47,180 --> 03:21:06,100
You know, he's not, he's not a toy. I don't want to do that to him. All right, crystalline.

836
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:12,139
Where's my, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. He's a dog. He's not going to get mad

837
03:21:12,139 --> 03:21:18,790
if you pick him up. All right. You see how many winks happen a stream? It's at least like six or

838
03:21:18,790 --> 03:21:24,170
seven. I don't want to like pick him up and put him down, pick him up, put him down, pick him up.

839
03:21:24,170 --> 03:21:44,420
Plus I got, guys, I have a back brace on now. I can't do that anymore. I can't even move. Stuck

840
03:21:44,420 --> 03:22:00,920
in the chair forever. Forever. How about a nose cam? All right, we need to go to the crystalline

841
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:05,879
passage by the frozen river. It's, I believe it's just to keep going up. Boys, up to the right.

842
03:22:05,879 --> 03:22:30,309
Once, once you start to see frozen stuff. Hey, you know, we're there. Somebody just asked us,

843
03:22:30,309 --> 03:22:35,829
does Otto know any tricks? Yeah. You know, sit, he knows, lie down, he knows, roll over.

844
03:22:38,170 --> 03:22:51,219
He can do a lot of stuff. Kim actually taught Otto a lot of stuff. I think it's up here. He's very

845
03:22:51,219 --> 03:22:58,340
smart. Well, he's very motivated, to put it that way. If you have a little treat in your hand,

846
03:22:58,340 --> 03:23:02,420
he will do whatever you want. He'll be like, let's go. I know every trick now.

847
03:23:02,819 --> 03:23:17,530
Without a treat, he's just like, nah. You're like, hey, Otto, roll over. He's like, no, why?

848
03:23:18,409 --> 03:23:26,389
Like, roll over, Otto. No, I don't have anything I want. Why would I? He's smart.

849
03:23:28,920 --> 03:23:44,950
He's like, I only do that with shit that I want. It's like his streamer dad.

850
03:23:45,829 --> 03:24:16,680
Quest reward. What's Otto's alignment? Um, dog. I think dog is its own alignment, don't you think?

851
03:24:17,559 --> 03:24:34,180
I need more. I feel like I have people, but not a lot of people. How? I'm being overwhelmed.

852
03:24:34,979 --> 03:24:47,190
German is only funny when you give him money. That's not true.

853
03:24:56,729 --> 03:25:03,799
All right, let's keep moving. Almost level 30. What? 32? Cool. All right. First align passage.

854
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:07,659
We need to go in. It's not this way. A little bit further up, I think.

855
03:25:08,540 --> 03:25:21,639
Tip of Archeron. Nope. There it is. Streamer, be mad for me. Um, I can do that. Yeah. Uh,

856
03:25:22,360 --> 03:25:28,280
just open up twitch.tv slash German nine eight five. Go to the videos tab.

857
03:25:29,319 --> 03:25:36,340
Uh, click. Oh yeah. Click on, uh, click on the Tony Hawk underground stream

858
03:25:37,530 --> 03:25:54,920
and fast forward to about nine hours into the stream and then let go and watch this thing sucks.

859
03:26:00,729 --> 03:26:10,200
The poison's all right, but just go watch the jump king stream. I'm glad I caught that live.

860
03:26:11,159 --> 03:26:16,870
I'm glad he caught it live too. I thought it was fun. I did. All right, here we go.

861
03:26:16,870 --> 03:26:22,840
Crystal line passage. Now we're fucking, this is no longer a joke now.

862
03:26:25,239 --> 03:26:31,209
Once we get through here, this is where we're going to see if I have what it takes to win.

863
03:26:32,170 --> 03:26:51,299
It's only muted for like 20 minutes. That's really good actually. It's only muted for 20 minutes,

864
03:26:51,299 --> 03:26:58,840
about 10 and a half hours. What songs got grabbed? What did anybody know? We've got, uh,

865
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:24,379
they killed all the skill ups. Level up. Can't revive champions, unfortunately. That'd be nice.

866
03:27:36,100 --> 03:27:56,600
Oh shit. I forgot that's the, that spawns a champion. All right. Let's, uh, do the skill

867
03:27:56,600 --> 03:28:08,069
point. Take a look. This is what we have so far. We're at the bottom here. Give me a better

868
03:28:08,069 --> 03:28:18,700
picture here in a second. Here we go. Take us somewhere. Take us somewhere. I'm going to

869
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:28,459
sneeze. So if you hate sneezing, I would, I would just leave the stream open. Walk away from your

870
03:28:28,459 --> 03:28:46,540
computer. No, it's not going to happen. Ah, the worst. Torn. This might be a zoom in.

871
03:28:49,139 --> 03:29:00,309
I think this is a zoom in. What does more revive do? More revives. So you can have two,

872
03:29:00,309 --> 03:29:09,100
three, four, five, six. I think we have to zoom in. Sorry teeth. That's never going to happen.

873
03:29:09,979 --> 03:29:56,120
Sorry teeth. Try again. Okay. Cancel crew. We're going to do a second point and revive. Thanks

874
03:29:56,120 --> 03:30:20,170
for voting. Don't go anywhere yet. Oh, he needs mana. He needs vitality. He needs more strength.

875
03:30:21,370 --> 03:30:50,899
Imagine helping the streamer. It's up to you. Vitality it is. This will get us a second revive.

876
03:30:51,860 --> 03:30:59,979
By the way, in case anyone is curious, revive. It just, every point you put in just lets me have

877
03:30:59,979 --> 03:31:10,409
more revives. That life and damage only comes from skeleton mastery and summon resist. So it pulls

878
03:31:10,409 --> 03:31:19,260
from skeleton mastery. This does not do anything else, but it gives me more revives. I want to

879
03:31:19,260 --> 03:31:26,280
make sure that's clear and whatever is yes, whatever is summoned, but let's get a,

880
03:31:27,239 --> 03:31:42,540
we have a harpy. I'll take both of these guys. They don't explode.

881
03:31:44,920 --> 03:32:00,729
He did. They both exploded. Great. These moonlords are really powerful. I'll take both of them.

882
03:32:05,290 --> 03:32:26,489
Can't explode though. I don't need them to revive anybody. All right. The skeleton mages that are

883
03:32:26,489 --> 03:32:39,100
freezing people. Could you hold off on doing that? My mana is such shit. If I revive one person,

884
03:32:39,979 --> 03:32:51,719
I have to drink a potion after doing one spell. Where are you going moonlord? Get over here.

885
03:32:52,440 --> 03:33:03,739
We're starting to get a very large amount of people. Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

886
03:33:03,739 --> 03:33:21,930
10, 11. There are 12 summons taking up lots of space. You have a whole community. It's just

887
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:30,680
going to get bigger. Especially with the revives. You can have like 20 revives, 12 skeletons,

888
03:33:30,920 --> 03:33:33,799
eight skeletal mages. You can have a stupid amount of people.

889
03:33:35,159 --> 03:33:59,770
These people have their own discord. Can I just say, they're all watching right now,

890
03:34:01,270 --> 03:34:05,030
I didn't think that I was going to be playing Diablo two into act five.

891
03:34:08,149 --> 03:34:12,100
I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this. I think this is really cool.

892
03:34:13,219 --> 03:34:19,180
I thought I was going to make it to like act one. I didn't think I was going to go much

893
03:34:19,180 --> 03:34:35,180
further than that. But here we are. I left a decent resist charm on the ground. It was like

894
03:34:35,180 --> 03:34:48,120
five resist. I apologize. I forgot it. Will I be able to enjoy Diablo non-hardcore after this?

895
03:34:48,120 --> 03:34:55,959
Yeah. Because as interesting as this is to do, I just like kind of running around and

896
03:34:55,959 --> 03:35:02,309
dying doesn't matter. And I prefer a non-hardcore character for sure.

897
03:35:05,209 --> 03:35:22,729
We need the crystalline frozen river for the frozen river. It's one of these places here.

898
03:35:41,739 --> 03:35:45,850
How did the moon lord die already? That'd be possible.

899
03:35:46,889 --> 03:36:09,059
The river is frozen because it's still a river. Yeah. There's the waypoint. Yeah, it is.

900
03:36:09,860 --> 03:36:20,729
Because it's just, it's a river, a river. All right. Let's find this passage down here.

901
03:36:20,729 --> 03:36:30,659
It really can only be this way. So it has to be over here and watch out for the champions.

902
03:36:31,459 --> 03:37:09,940
I wish I could revive these guys. Surprise me with a unique, unique frozen river. Anya

903
03:37:09,940 --> 03:37:12,579
is out here somewhere. There's also, I remember there's a champion here that can be a pain in

904
03:37:12,579 --> 03:37:22,250
the ass. Oh, I'm going to be careful. These vomitables are a little boy. I'm going to stay

905
03:37:22,250 --> 03:37:41,540
back here. I'm going to go over there. Revive. See that ship. My man is so bad. It's just a brawl.

906
03:37:42,180 --> 03:38:06,700
I don't even know who's winning. I hope it's us. Burrito turns into pure carbon. It's still a burrito.

907
03:38:07,659 --> 03:38:18,549
No, I don't think so.

908
03:38:26,090 --> 03:38:32,790
No, it's carbon. Yeah, because if a river freezes, it's still water.

909
03:38:33,829 --> 03:38:50,260
Burrito turns into carbon, then it's carbon. It's not still a burrito. Quantum burrito. The game was,

910
03:38:50,260 --> 03:38:57,459
oh, by the way, I, I know the story now. I know I, I knew it already, but I, I know, I know the whole

911
03:38:57,459 --> 03:39:04,870
story. I was kind of on the right track. The shit I was saying to you guys was a joke. I didn't

912
03:39:04,950 --> 03:39:15,940
really believe that. Um, but yeah, that's pretty cool. That's a pretty cool story.

913
03:39:16,739 --> 03:39:25,659
That's a pretty cool story. Story of the quantum burrito. No, the story of the story of

914
03:39:25,659 --> 03:39:44,219
Outer Wilds. Playing like I'm five, the Outer Wilds. No, I've read a couple of timelines.

915
03:39:45,030 --> 03:39:51,989
There were some good timelines to really piece the whole thing together. Like a whole chronological

916
03:39:51,989 --> 03:39:58,100
events. Easy to see that way. And I don't want to talk about anything about it because

917
03:39:58,100 --> 03:40:02,020
people probably hear them might not have played it, but it's pretty good. It's pretty good.

918
03:40:03,139 --> 03:40:26,040
Reenus synopsis? Yeah, kind of. Isn't that what you do? All right. Anya, where are you?

919
03:40:26,600 --> 03:40:47,219
Usually right in the middle, right? Oh, that wasn't smart. It's still alive. I have way too

920
03:40:47,219 --> 03:41:07,350
many healing potions. It's just like, just throw them away. I love that sound. That paladin

921
03:41:07,350 --> 03:41:29,270
charge sound. It's got a good ring to it. All right, Anya, come on. What the hell? Not down here.

922
03:41:30,870 --> 03:41:42,540
Pain in the ass. Fine. Outer Wilds is supposed to come to Steam this year.

923
03:41:48,170 --> 03:42:07,370
Well, sooner the better. Don't get overwhelmed. A little too late. Yeah, they did kind of release

924
03:42:07,370 --> 03:42:12,170
that game on Epic Games Store right when Epic Games Store was kind of becoming that

925
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:16,969
exclusivity thing, right? How long? When did it come out? Like six months ago? Seven months ago?

926
03:42:18,090 --> 03:42:30,629
Is it on the Windows Store? I don't know. I don't know very many people that use the Windows Store.

927
03:42:31,510 --> 03:42:48,229
It was early last year. Yeah. Games for Windows. Pog. Or what? All right. Hey,

928
03:42:49,110 --> 03:42:57,579
what's the anti-pog? What is anti-pog? Is there one? I feel like the market could be super,

929
03:42:58,459 --> 03:43:05,989
what's anti-pog? Resident, but no, I don't know. Resident Sleeper is like, I'm like,

930
03:43:05,989 --> 03:43:13,719
this is boring. I'm falling asleep. Anti-pog would be like, what you did was not as cool

931
03:43:13,719 --> 03:43:22,489
as you thought it was. Like you did something that was supposed to be exciting, but it wasn't.

932
03:43:22,969 --> 03:43:41,049
Ha ha. Yeah, but I guess.

933
03:43:51,020 --> 03:44:10,780
Balefish? Yeah, never mind. Balefish fills that completely. Not like this. Yeah. Yeah, they're

934
03:44:10,780 --> 03:44:27,450
there. They're there. Have I played Temtem? No, I have not played Temtem. I probably will not

935
03:44:27,450 --> 03:44:33,319
play Temtem. I probably will avoid Temtem. I don't have a plan to play it. Not, well,

936
03:44:33,319 --> 03:44:42,700
avoid was probably the wrong word to use. I'm going to use a better one. I'm not into collecting

937
03:44:42,700 --> 03:45:01,299
and fighting monsters unless they come from a seedy stone. Pretty much it. I think we're close.

938
03:45:11,620 --> 03:45:45,770
Can we get a price check on Chibi Robo, please? 200. It's 200. Still, it's 200. Wait, you can

939
03:45:45,770 --> 03:46:03,430
buy it on the GameStop website? Remember when Jerma used to play TF2? Pepe Hands.

940
03:46:04,920 --> 03:46:35,930
Oh, no. I played it every single day. What are you talking about? TF2 waiting room. Well,

941
03:46:37,129 --> 03:46:40,889
you're going to be waiting. They're there. Your appointment's not for a very long time. You'll

942
03:46:40,889 --> 03:46:48,440
be waiting a very long time. I think you should probably bring some snacks and maybe a few dinners

943
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:59,159
to that waiting room. Not only dinners, like rations. And when by waiting room,

944
03:46:59,159 --> 03:47:17,110
I hope you mean bunker because you're going to be there for a while. So many potions, but no

945
03:47:17,829 --> 03:47:38,659
mana potions. No, I have no plan to play it on stream or anything. It's a great game. One of the

946
03:47:38,659 --> 03:47:55,930
best. Do I enjoy variety too much to play what play that message, but I think it's got the gist

947
03:47:55,930 --> 03:48:01,930
of it. Do I like variety too much to stick with something, pick something that I played or liked

948
03:48:01,930 --> 03:48:10,469
or stay with one game? I'm not even sure it's about variety as much as it's I can't stay with

949
03:48:10,469 --> 03:48:17,590
the same thing. Like I just, for example, I'm not playing Diablo two right now to like make sure my

950
03:48:17,590 --> 03:48:26,139
stream has variety. This is just what I want to do. Everything you see, I mean, sure there's a lot

951
03:48:26,139 --> 03:48:32,780
of recommendations on the channel and you do a lot of them, but it's not, this is not like variety

952
03:48:32,780 --> 03:48:38,379
for the sake of me doing, oh, I'm going to do variety for the channel. My brain needs to be

953
03:48:39,100 --> 03:48:50,010
constantly stimulated and I get bored really easily. So that's why it was a shock that I was

954
03:48:50,010 --> 03:48:55,370
able to really stay with TF2 for that long. That just speaks to how good that game actually is.

955
03:48:56,170 --> 03:49:04,729
Are we boring you? No, I'm talking about video games, not like talking to people.

956
03:49:08,620 --> 03:49:24,309
We're getting kind of creamed here. I need mana. Where are you going? That guy just

957
03:49:24,309 --> 03:49:32,120
fucked off somewhere. Hey, get back here. You're supposed to be helping this frozen Stein.

958
03:49:32,120 --> 03:49:45,110
This is going to get bad. Kill frozen Stein first. Oh, the thing I wasn't standing there.

959
03:49:51,530 --> 03:49:56,250
This mission is really awesome. You get a very, very special,

960
03:49:58,309 --> 03:50:10,790
you get a very special item for doing this. And.

961
03:50:19,719 --> 03:50:22,920
Son. That bastard.

962
03:50:25,799 --> 03:50:38,360
Do I ever get a desire to go back to TF2? Um, not, not in the way that you think.

963
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:46,100
Not in the way that you think. I do miss Team Fortress 2 because a lot of people have tried

964
03:50:46,100 --> 03:50:52,840
to do this too and I think have not done it as well or have failed trying. It's very specific.

965
03:50:53,639 --> 03:51:01,020
It's making your characters in your game, the character classes, the people that you play as,

966
03:51:02,920 --> 03:51:10,090
such interesting personality types and such truly engaging characters

967
03:51:10,809 --> 03:51:15,379
that you want to play as them and you want to hear more of their stories.

968
03:51:16,260 --> 03:51:22,860
People have tried to do, like, remember those shorts? I remember when the only ones that were

969
03:51:22,860 --> 03:51:29,180
out were, there were three of them. And when Meet the Medic was in development for like

970
03:51:29,180 --> 03:51:36,729
four years, Meet the Medic was supposed to come out in like 2009 or something. It was

971
03:51:36,729 --> 03:51:43,399
a huge fucking deal when it came out. I think a lot of game companies have tried to do that

972
03:51:44,899 --> 03:51:54,950
and it's just not as interesting. Like the character, the demo man character

973
03:51:55,989 --> 03:52:03,510
was fucking awesome. The spy was awesome. They all had these insanely different personalities.

974
03:52:03,510 --> 03:52:12,790
I mean, they're all crazy, but in different ways. I don't think there'll ever be another TF2 demo

975
03:52:12,790 --> 03:52:18,520
man. I really don't. I don't think that people will try, but I don't know if it'll ever happen.

976
03:52:18,520 --> 03:52:26,229
The heavy, the heavy weapons guy, just think of that. Oh, by the way, big deal. Big deal.

977
03:52:29,139 --> 03:52:40,250
Oh no, not yet. Toilet. Heavy weapons guys, just characterization wise, voice acting wise,

978
03:52:40,969 --> 03:52:52,309
they all had these crazy personalities. We forgot about the princess. And the thing about

979
03:52:52,309 --> 03:53:00,040
the TF2 voices guys and the actors that play them, they're not big famous names in the industry.

980
03:53:01,239 --> 03:53:06,840
The guy that's the demo man and the heavy weapons guy is not some heavyweight in the voice acting

981
03:53:06,840 --> 03:53:19,479
world. The medic is really the only one that has an actor that was at the times. I mean,

982
03:53:19,479 --> 03:53:24,520
still Robin Atkins Downs at the time in like 2007, that was a long time ago.

983
03:53:27,899 --> 03:53:35,079
Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. This spell to increase your resistances

984
03:53:35,079 --> 03:53:41,139
as a token of my thanks. It isn't much, but I hope you find it helpful.

985
03:53:41,139 --> 03:53:49,579
Nathan was streaming a little while ago. Yeah, he, he streams and he's, he's around. The

986
03:53:49,579 --> 03:53:55,270
characterization that he gave to that scout. I mean, when you first played as the scout,

987
03:53:55,909 --> 03:54:05,909
it was just like, this guy, I love this. This is awesome. We've actually streamed together before.

988
03:54:06,950 --> 03:54:10,549
Some of you guys that might, the last couple of years or the last year or two, you may not have

989
03:54:10,549 --> 03:54:16,309
watched the streams, but he's been on stream like three or four times. We played Dark Souls

990
03:54:16,309 --> 03:54:25,239
together one time. Yeah, we played Dark Souls three. I get permanent resistance for taking this.

991
03:54:25,879 --> 03:54:40,540
Take a look. Pretty awesome. It's always there. Permanent. Let's talk to Anya. Remember when

992
03:54:40,540 --> 03:54:55,899
Jeremy used to play Dark Souls? Well, remember the future where I play Elden Ring and like

993
03:54:55,899 --> 03:55:01,299
collaboration streams. You should collab, you should collab. Yeah, we've talked about

994
03:55:01,299 --> 03:55:05,700
collabs before. We've talked about streaming with other streamers and stuff before. It's,

995
03:55:05,700 --> 03:55:12,569
I don't really do it. Very rarely is there a multiplayer stream here. It's just kind of,

996
03:55:12,569 --> 03:55:17,129
I just kind of do my own thing. Organically, something might come along where it's like,

997
03:55:17,129 --> 03:55:35,430
yeah, that sounds like fun. Let's do that. Bomb streams with Joel were great. Yeah,

998
03:55:35,430 --> 03:55:43,610
they were a lot of fun. Nelufak has escaped to his temple where he's being a real piece of shit.

999
03:55:44,649 --> 03:55:52,629
I mean, I talked, I talked to a lot of people and stuff, but I have that sort of philosophy,

1000
03:55:52,629 --> 03:56:03,370
that sort of philosophy of, hold on, this is actually kind of good. Ray's Skeletal Mage.

1001
03:56:04,889 --> 03:56:10,489
Can I finally just get rid of this fucking thing? This thing is bad. Two to Ray's Skeleton.

1002
03:56:13,159 --> 03:56:17,159
38, 20. Look at how bad this is. It's just because it has the two in Ray's Skeleton.

1003
03:56:17,799 --> 03:56:35,299
A part of the reasons why I do mostly solo stuff is because I talk a lot. I'm like, oh,

1004
03:56:35,299 --> 03:56:38,659
it's like, oh, look at me. I got to say this and I got to say this and I got to say, and I,

1005
03:56:38,659 --> 03:56:44,440
anytime there's like more than two, three, four people in a stream call or something, it's always

1006
03:56:44,440 --> 03:56:49,399
like, especially when you get to be about three, four plus kind of people, it's almost like you

1007
03:56:49,399 --> 03:56:56,489
take turns talking and you don't want to talk over somebody and somebody has something to say,

1008
03:56:56,489 --> 03:56:58,569
but then you don't, you have something to say, but you don't want to talk over them. And

1009
03:56:59,530 --> 03:57:02,569
it almost becomes like, cause, and especially if everybody's streaming at the same time,

1010
03:57:02,569 --> 03:57:06,170
if you have like three streamers who are all streaming at the same time, they all want to

1011
03:57:06,170 --> 03:57:10,729
talk. They all want to talk to their audience and engage with people and talk and try to make it

1012
03:57:10,729 --> 03:57:16,360
fun. And you want to, you almost become like, it's my turn to entertain my audience. No, now

1013
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:19,479
it's my turn to entertain my audience. No, it's my turn to entertain my audience. It's like,

1014
03:57:19,479 --> 03:57:31,819
you're going a weird circle. And then when people start muting each other and muting themselves and

1015
03:57:32,459 --> 03:57:36,739
somebody like is talking to their chat and then it's like, Hey, you still here? Yep. I'm here.

1016
03:57:36,739 --> 03:57:46,379
What? Yep. And the sounds of other people talking, let's say, let's say I am mute,

1017
03:57:46,940 --> 03:57:50,219
I mute the stream, you know, it's just something I don't really like to do.

1018
03:57:51,020 --> 03:57:59,899
I love playing multiple, when it works, it works. Right. And some people love

1019
03:58:00,780 --> 03:58:04,860
doing content in groups and it works very, very well for them. There's like, there are at least

1020
03:58:04,860 --> 03:58:09,819
three or four streaming groups that stream together almost every time on this site.

1021
03:58:10,790 --> 03:58:14,389
And they do a great fucking job and they really connect together and they work together perfectly.

1022
03:58:18,840 --> 03:58:34,200
I, I kind of just like doing me, you know, I'm just me here. And that's not to say this is

1023
03:58:34,200 --> 03:58:39,270
the right or wrong way to do that. But, you know, you, you do the things that you know,

1024
03:58:39,270 --> 03:58:47,940
that you'd like to do. That's pretty much it. I can't remove this because it has two

1025
03:58:47,940 --> 03:59:04,969
to raise skeleton in it. I can't let this be, I can't hold this over my own head. It's only one

1026
03:59:04,969 --> 03:59:09,799
point. If we're losing, how many points, what would we lose? One skeleton. All right. The

1027
03:59:09,799 --> 03:59:20,680
skeletons suck anyways. They're dying. One to confuse, one to raise. We lose one point.

1028
03:59:20,680 --> 03:59:26,969
That's going on. Look at how much other stuff we get. Fire block,

1029
03:59:29,290 --> 03:59:36,790
mana, lightning resist. And I actually get to have poison dagger. Hey Jarvis, this is Diablo. Please

1030
03:59:36,790 --> 03:59:42,790
stop cheating at my game. You think the tricks or glitches are so cool, but you're going to ruin the

1031
03:59:42,790 --> 03:59:47,590
immersion game that I make for you. You think duping is cool. You think cheating is cool.

1032
03:59:47,590 --> 03:59:55,700
If not, it's not. Please stop. I'm crying. That comment just get removed. I think it just got

1033
03:59:55,700 --> 04:00:06,969
purged. I got to get rid of some of this stuff. What time is it? I'm going to check the time.

1034
04:00:07,610 --> 04:00:21,829
Okay. I still got a little bit. Still got a little bit of time. Rip that dev. Okay. Ort.

1035
04:00:22,629 --> 04:00:39,819
This is Tao. Oh, how many spells do I have? Can I make anything? Yes, I can. I can make this.

1036
04:00:40,700 --> 04:00:48,299
Diamonds like not very good. I never was a fan of the diamonds in this game.

1037
04:00:49,100 --> 04:01:07,979
Is all res- no, all resist eight is better. I have to sell the rest of this shit. Okay.

1038
04:01:08,700 --> 04:01:30,760
Still have this lightning resist jewel. I have nowhere to put it. Oh, what's my favorite PS2 game?

1039
04:01:31,850 --> 04:01:53,129
Sure thing. Uh, the bouncer that looks clean. You're good to go now. Okay. No, no, no. I got

1040
04:01:53,129 --> 04:02:09,579
to go back in. I got to go to, uh, Alice. You were about to see the thing that Blizzard had to patch

1041
04:02:09,579 --> 04:02:15,610
because it was so easy to farm. Did you see where I just went in? Right? See this guy right here?

1042
04:02:16,250 --> 04:02:25,700
Endel skin. You could just pour it in here and okay. This is like a thousand people. Hold on.

1043
04:02:37,530 --> 04:02:43,450
They, uh, nerfed his loot table because it was too easy just to come in here and just

1044
04:02:43,450 --> 04:03:04,340
kill him instantly and leave. And he dropped really, really good shit. Stop hitting me.

1045
04:03:04,340 --> 04:03:11,940
Damn. Killed him. I would laugh my ass off if he dropped like a Zod rune right now.

1046
04:03:12,659 --> 04:03:36,299
I would. I would, I would laugh my ass off. Where is he? Endel skin.

1047
04:03:38,500 --> 04:03:45,860
Is he already dead? I think he's already dead. These guys come back to life. Did I- wait, did

1048
04:03:45,860 --> 04:04:08,899
he come out? Yeah, he's dead. Uh, we're going to level up though. Take a look. At this point,

1049
04:04:08,899 --> 04:04:23,139
do I even give you guys choice? All right. Make sure if when you click, yes, yes, yes. Uh-huh.

1050
04:04:23,139 --> 04:04:27,860
I will. All right. Make sure when you click, if you're clicking down here,

1051
04:04:28,500 --> 04:04:36,819
if you want fire golem, make sure you click like over here. If you want revive, make sure you're

1052
04:04:36,819 --> 04:04:42,790
clicking like here so the bubbles can spread out. We don't have to zoom in. If you want teeth,

1053
04:04:43,350 --> 04:04:47,989
well, then you're just out of your mind and you're deliberately trying to ruin my video

1054
04:04:47,989 --> 04:05:31,659
game playthrough and I don't appreciate it. Okay. I'm going to let this play out for a little bit

1055
04:05:31,659 --> 04:05:39,739
because it's okay. So I have to, I have to ask for help here. There are 4,500 people watching

1056
04:05:39,739 --> 04:05:49,399
right now and there are 560 votes. For the love of God, please, some of you, fix this.

1057
04:05:59,459 --> 04:06:12,379
But third point is just throwing it in the trash. He's influencing. Well, I directly asked.

1058
04:06:18,069 --> 04:06:27,479
I don't know where the bubbles are going to separate here. It looks like a majority want

1059
04:06:27,479 --> 04:06:59,879
to go down there. 55, 55. That's 20, 20. Zoom in. I have to zoom in. Do it again.

1060
04:07:08,659 --> 04:07:44,360
I'm going to squish it. I have to like really squish this. Get it so you can see both. Okay.

1061
04:07:49,059 --> 04:08:22,409
Again, germamandering. Nobody clicked on the curse menu. If even one person had clicked,

1062
04:08:22,729 --> 04:08:34,819
on amplified damage, nobody clicked over there. I did. Oh, looks like we're doing another point

1063
04:08:34,819 --> 04:08:48,489
into fire golem. Oh, this game is so lame. Can't we have some fun? Whoa. Calling Diablo 2 lame.

1064
04:08:50,329 --> 04:08:59,590
What the heck? What the fuck? I'm upset about that comment. All right, let's go.

1065
04:09:00,549 --> 04:09:11,530
Fire golem. Another point. And pick these two. The dreamcast sucks. Laughing my ass off.

1066
04:09:12,250 --> 04:09:22,760
The dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. That's one of my favorite moments ever on stream.

1067
04:09:23,319 --> 04:09:28,520
Hey guys, I'm showing you this cool dreamcast. Look at all these games. This one sucks. This

1068
04:09:28,520 --> 04:09:33,719
one's not very good. This one's really, really crusty and really not very like kind of bad game.

1069
04:09:34,520 --> 04:09:42,100
Somebody just random dude in chat. The dreamcast fucking sucks. L-M-A-L. In the middle of like one

1070
04:09:42,100 --> 04:09:52,459
of those kind of bad games that I was trying to show. Like that person may have never even seen

1071
04:09:52,459 --> 04:09:58,809
the dreamcast before. It's just like, dude, this console sucks. Like, no, it doesn't. I promise.

1072
04:09:59,610 --> 04:10:26,200
All right, vitality. Did I get like banned from single player? What the hell was that? Here's

1073
04:10:26,200 --> 04:10:38,600
what's going to happen. Fire golem. That's way more damage. That's a lot of damage. Did I get

1074
04:10:38,600 --> 04:10:42,760
timed out? You can't even, you can't get timed out in single player. You know, it'll probably

1075
04:10:42,760 --> 04:10:47,959
happen. I had game paused. When I clicked back into the window, it probably clicked right here

1076
04:10:48,520 --> 04:10:59,979
and just, it's all right. I wasn't that far. All right, we're going to, our guy is good. 124 mana.

1077
04:11:00,620 --> 04:11:09,510
What a joke. Speaking of which, I'm just going to fill my sack with mana. Just

1078
04:11:09,510 --> 04:11:28,219
to the brim. One spell requires a full potion, so that sucks. I need a better belt too. Look at all

1079
04:11:28,219 --> 04:11:36,100
this bad shit that I have on. Why is the cube in your inventory? Or extra space in my inventory?

1080
04:11:36,100 --> 04:11:42,340
I usually put the cube here, but people were not happy about that. So I'm doing the thing that

1081
04:11:42,340 --> 04:11:51,319
people were saying to try. Okay, let's go. Hey, we get to kill Pindleskin again.

1082
04:11:52,040 --> 04:12:04,139
The scent of death. How's the fire go? I'm doing better than last time.

1083
04:12:05,020 --> 04:12:16,860
It's got like an AOE effect. It's all right. Um, guys, we've got, we're getting close in.

1084
04:12:17,500 --> 04:12:38,059
I got some friends now. We're good. Oh, I heard the ding and I was like, no way. Oh, I only have

1085
04:12:38,059 --> 04:12:45,180
four skeletons, but I took up the fuck. That's right. I'm sitting there going, why can I get a

1086
04:12:45,180 --> 04:12:51,530
fifth skeleton? I was thinking about getting a fireman tattoo. Shale. That's a pretty rare one.

1087
04:12:52,329 --> 04:12:59,670
That's actually not, that's pretty good. This is not, this is rare. It's not super rare. It's like

1088
04:12:59,670 --> 04:13:12,069
second or third tier. That's pretty good. That's like a two, uh, tier two. That's pretty good. Nice.

1089
04:13:12,629 --> 04:13:30,569
I'm happy about that. Okay, let's move. Neelifax temple. What the fuck do I have this? Oh yeah,

1090
04:13:30,569 --> 04:13:47,590
cause I have a million potions. Oh, let's store these junk. So we're trying to go down all the

1091
04:13:47,590 --> 04:13:59,750
way to go fight Neelifax guy that imprisoned Anya in the ice. Get a bigger belt. Oh my God.

1092
04:14:06,979 --> 04:14:18,729
I would, but I mean the cold resistant, the defense is just, it's really good. It's really

1093
04:14:18,729 --> 04:14:25,159
good. I just realized my title doesn't make any sense anymore. I thought I was going to spend way

1094
04:14:25,159 --> 04:14:31,690
longer on Diablo. I beat Diablo in like 45 minutes. I thought it was going to be the whole stream.

1095
04:14:31,690 --> 04:14:37,000
Be trying desperately to get them to die. I'm like having them refill his health for like two

1096
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:50,819
hours. Well, it's still the name of the game. Yeah, that's true. It is the name of the game.

1097
04:14:50,819 --> 04:15:10,069
You're right. All right. Don't go too far. These nightlords demons. I want both of them.

1098
04:15:11,190 --> 04:15:21,500
It's not over here. See if I can quickly find this. Then we have to go to Mount Ariat and that's when

1099
04:15:21,500 --> 04:15:28,569
the stream turns off. I don't think I'll be able to do it, but hey, I will try. I'll give it a solid

1100
04:15:28,569 --> 04:15:58,520
attempt. I'd say I'd be ready. The halls of want, halls of not, whatever it's called. What is it?

1101
04:15:58,520 --> 04:16:10,329
What am I looking for? Halls of something. All right guys. Dead. Leveled up. Let's see. Level

1102
04:16:11,129 --> 04:16:40,010
33. Good. Nice. Good job. Let's get the skeleton through back. Hi. Follow me.

1103
04:16:40,569 --> 04:16:52,969
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I forgot how big this place actually was. It's kind of huge.

1104
04:16:53,610 --> 04:17:12,870
New champions? No. Oh, am I getting cocky? Oh, I think I got cocky. All right. Okay. I'm okay.

1105
04:17:14,969 --> 04:17:37,459
Ooh, I just can run so fast. It's like almost a shame if I don't run. That champion. All right.

1106
04:17:37,459 --> 04:17:58,010
Pause here so we can rebuild the, uh, the team here. Okay. Let's keep going. I'm surprised I

1107
04:17:58,010 --> 04:18:19,209
haven't found it. I can just zoom around. I think it's up here and when it's, if I take a look.

1108
04:18:22,709 --> 04:18:31,770
Okay. This is a stupid idea. Really bad idea. No, I have potions. Nevermind. Pause it. Freeze it here.

1109
04:18:36,780 --> 04:18:45,700
Well, we're in trouble. I may have flown too close to the sun here. It's possible.

1110
04:18:46,500 --> 04:19:09,879
No, we're good. Am I talking about it? Fine. Yeah. Shit. I thought it was for sure it was

1111
04:19:09,879 --> 04:19:28,659
gonna be right here. Come on. Don't make me run all over the place. I just want to find the next

1112
04:19:28,659 --> 04:20:00,170
level. Yeah. I'm right. Show auto. I can't show auto. He's not here. Flying around looking for

1113
04:20:00,729 --> 04:20:10,739
the place to go down. I'm so glad I can run this fast. Um, maybe I should rethink my strategy

1114
04:20:11,379 --> 04:20:25,690
because that was pretty close. Damn. All right. Hold up here.

1115
04:20:25,690 --> 04:21:04,579
I need some revives. Holy shit. Angelic sickle. Three to eight. Oh, yippee. I wonder if it,

1116
04:21:05,219 --> 04:21:12,280
I think I have the angelic blood. Interrupt whatever your dog is doing and bring him here

1117
04:21:12,280 --> 04:21:30,020
for our entertainment, Jeremy. I'm not gonna do that. Jesus. I can't. There it is. All right.

1118
04:21:30,020 --> 04:22:04,629
Halls of Ayn. One more level. Hopefully I find it quick. Wait for me. Keep moving.

1119
04:22:13,940 --> 04:22:33,780
Stop. Lucky. Good. Finally. Took me long enough. Let's go kill Neelathak.

1120
04:22:34,420 --> 04:23:04,090
It's a lot of sapphire. That's pretty good. What if he's going to die? Yes. I love the love

1121
04:23:04,090 --> 04:23:25,430
that was that through. Oh, I forgot about this quest. For doing this, you get to name an item.

1122
04:23:26,309 --> 04:23:32,459
You get to take any item that you own. Okay. Here he is. Where is he?

1123
04:23:33,100 --> 04:23:42,219
It's like right here somewhere. There he is. Okay. They're all his minions. It's necromancer

1124
04:23:42,219 --> 04:24:17,059
versus necromancer. They're his summoned ogres. Just playing auto chess. Get in. He has corpse

1125
04:24:17,059 --> 04:24:30,280
explosion though. That can kill me in probably one hit. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even

1126
04:24:30,280 --> 04:24:40,090
stepping over there. See? Holy fuck. He has a lot of corpses to work with. All right. He's just a

1127
04:24:40,090 --> 04:24:43,690
necromancer like me. Just go up there and punch him in the face. All right. Will you guys get

1128
04:24:43,690 --> 04:25:09,110
out of here? Stop. Fight this thing. Whoa. Kill him. All right. Let's go. Teleports are wrong.

1129
04:25:10,309 --> 04:25:25,770
All right. He ain't getting away now. We got this in the bag. Wait till something dies and then just

1130
04:25:25,770 --> 04:25:45,540
bring it back to life. He's... Come on, Vic. I know you're capable. What's happening to fireman?

1131
04:25:48,600 --> 04:26:21,420
Mike, get on him. Where'd he go? Get him. Get him. He's right here. Get over there, fireman. Come on.

1132
04:26:26,420 --> 04:26:55,290
Hill. Go get him. Just don't step on any landmines. I'll be all right. Um, there's no potions?

1133
04:26:55,290 --> 04:27:22,969
How are there no potions? He's gonna corpse explode dead. All right. Aye. You dick. He was an evil

1134
04:27:22,969 --> 04:28:06,149
man. Yes he was. I got these cool things. So now it's time to see if this stream is going to continue.

1135
04:28:07,110 --> 04:28:17,829
This is where we figure it out. Speaking of figuring it out. Do I have any angelic stuff?

1136
04:28:17,829 --> 04:28:27,620
No. So I... I just was gonna sneeze and it went into my body. That was... That sucked.

1137
04:28:28,940 --> 04:28:36,250
Ugh. I was like... It went backwards down into my... Into my stomach and shit. That was weird.

1138
04:28:36,809 --> 04:28:51,450
I was trying to. I don't have any angelic stuff, no. Sanders. Arctic. Not angelic.

1139
04:28:52,329 --> 04:29:04,649
Bands. Rathras. No. No. Just a little shitty normal one. Just a shitty normal one.

1140
04:29:05,209 --> 04:29:17,340
I do have a shield. That's good. So talk to Anya before you continue through the crystalline

1141
04:29:17,340 --> 04:29:28,260
passage past the glacial trail to proceed up to Mount Ariat. Is this the sword angelic? Wait.

1142
04:29:30,340 --> 04:29:49,979
No, no, no. Oh no. You guys confused me for a second. All right. Let's go.

1143
04:29:50,780 --> 04:30:00,620
Back to the glacial trail. Do I have the waypoint? I'm an idiot and didn't get it.

1144
04:30:03,850 --> 04:30:07,399
I bet he can't play with facecam on. Oh yeah?

1145
04:30:09,719 --> 04:30:18,059
You're right. Travel through the ancients way to find the ancients at the Ariat summit.

1146
04:30:22,389 --> 04:30:34,100
I did not get... No, I did. Thank goodness. We went the glacial trail and then we need to go to

1147
04:30:34,100 --> 04:30:41,100
Mount Ariat. And I'll be in the process of probably saying my goodbyes.

1148
04:30:42,059 --> 04:30:52,700
It was a good run. I'm gonna try. It's a good run. You look like a cop. That's the first I've ever

1149
04:30:52,700 --> 04:31:11,590
heard that. Glacial trail. I think I've walked by it, didn't I? We are going to put this on players

1150
04:31:11,590 --> 04:31:16,739
one because the ancients are going to be the thing that's going to be nearly impossible for

1151
04:31:16,739 --> 04:31:34,120
me to do, I think. It is very necessary. Call me lame all you want. I'm still going... I'm going to

1152
04:31:34,120 --> 04:31:53,000
survive. Glacial trail. Is that not it? Speed walking. Holy fuck. Now, this is the crystal.

1153
04:31:53,000 --> 04:32:07,989
Where is this? Ariat plateau. Nope. We need the glacial trail. You guys good in there?

1154
04:32:08,709 --> 04:32:35,590
You guys all right? All right. Everybody's all right. Look, we're fine. It might get lucky.

1155
04:32:35,590 --> 04:33:00,250
It might just be right here. Oh my fuck. Okay, guys. Help. Friends. Skeletal mages keep just

1156
04:33:00,250 --> 04:33:30,250
dying instantly. Warhammer. Eh, okay. How we doing? We still have a full team, right?

1157
04:33:34,900 --> 04:33:57,099
Glacial trail. Glacial trail. Not over here. Aw, too bad. Where is it? Down lower left?

1158
04:33:58,060 --> 04:34:06,790
Wait, Ariat plateau leads to glacial trail. Does it? I thought it was crystalline to glacial.

1159
04:34:06,790 --> 04:34:21,259
Oh. Is that true? I don't remember. I remember it being crystalline to crystal.

1160
04:34:21,979 --> 04:34:31,110
Because here's the frozen. Frozen river. Maybe, yeah, you're right. Fuck. Ariat plateau. But

1161
04:34:31,110 --> 04:34:40,389
wasn't Ariat plateau behind the glacial trail and the waypoint? I always thought that was. Diablo

1162
04:34:40,389 --> 04:35:00,860
to poser. Not a real wink. I know a real wink when I see one and that's not a real one. Oh my god.

1163
04:35:01,659 --> 04:35:24,389
I can't just run through that. Oh my god. Where's Vic? I think he's just fighting down there by

1164
04:35:24,389 --> 04:35:31,740
himself. Oh my. Look at this. He's just getting. Alright, I have to go. That's not happening. I'm

1165
04:35:31,740 --> 04:35:59,830
gonna get my team to go in there. That's not happening. Okay. There's that. Let's get fire

1166
04:35:59,830 --> 04:36:14,970
back and let's get mages and then go back in. Follow me. 15k away from a wink here?

1167
04:36:15,610 --> 04:36:46,950
Well, use those points wisely. Use them very wisely. Here we go. One, two, three, in. Can

1168
04:36:46,950 --> 04:37:07,369
you wink anything other than your eye? Okay. I don't. How did I read that? I don't know. I

1169
04:37:07,369 --> 04:37:34,630
didn't understand until after reading it. Whoa. They were just sitting here. Sestus. Alright.

1170
04:37:35,560 --> 04:37:42,169
Ancient's Way. Look at the glacial trail. I think I know where it is. I think it's on this side.

1171
04:37:44,470 --> 04:38:01,450
Wait. Is it up here? I feel like it's not up here. I really don't remember. I thought it

1172
04:38:01,450 --> 04:38:23,909
was glacial trail to. Hmm. Glacial trail is up top right. You mean like this way? Or you mean in

1173
04:38:23,909 --> 04:38:38,459
that in the. It's been a while. I don't remember. I think I can run fast. It's inside the frozen

1174
04:38:38,459 --> 04:38:43,849
cave there, right? Go to the ancient. Yeah. I'm trying to remember where to go.

1175
04:38:44,490 --> 04:38:48,790
I kind of forget. I've done this a million times, but I just don't really remember.

1176
04:38:49,590 --> 04:38:58,500
It's crystalline and then into glacial way, right? Crystalline to glacial and glacial to

1177
04:38:59,220 --> 04:39:18,090
the summit. No, it definitely is. Hold on. Yeah. I had it right the first time, didn't I? I

1178
04:39:18,090 --> 04:39:26,459
definitely had it right the first time. At least I thought I did. Yeah, I had it right. Alright.

1179
04:39:26,459 --> 04:39:45,240
Let's go. Slowly making our way to the ancients. I got the shoes. Might as well use them.

1180
04:39:45,959 --> 04:39:52,119
Although I want to level up one more time. So let's not run through this.

1181
04:40:06,630 --> 04:40:22,860
Saber. Don't die. I definitely will not die before the ancients. I do want to be level 30. I want

1182
04:40:22,860 --> 04:40:37,979
to be level 34 though. If you beat the ancients, you get three to five levels. So 30 pog. You get

1183
04:40:38,220 --> 04:40:56,380
three full levels or four full levels by doing the ancients. It's pretty pog. Look, I'm using

1184
04:40:56,380 --> 04:41:06,409
twitch speak. I'm using it correctly too. So at 34, this final point is really going to matter.

1185
04:41:07,529 --> 04:41:11,529
These final points, but we're going to potentially determine the end of this whole thing.

1186
04:41:11,529 --> 04:41:31,770
We can't even pog. What the fuck are we supposed to do? You can pog. It just doesn't show up. I like

1187
04:41:31,770 --> 04:41:49,369
reading it. I prefer to read it than to see it. I like pog. I like it. This pog champ exists,

1188
04:41:49,369 --> 04:41:58,439
but pog is you saying it. When you do pog champ, that's your face. That's your,

1189
04:41:58,439 --> 04:42:19,689
you're not saying anything. You're saying pog. A little different. Come on. Let me get to 34

1190
04:42:19,689 --> 04:42:28,490
before I go to the ancients. Come on. Come on. This is my face. This is not your face.

1191
04:42:31,270 --> 04:42:53,369
I know what your face looks like. Not that Dave. You guys remember when, um, I wanted to do that

1192
04:42:53,369 --> 04:43:04,409
joke where in the title of the stream, I titled the stream like Anthony Roberts, come to this stream

1193
04:43:06,680 --> 04:43:14,540
or like this street. I wanted to do that so bad. Dave Smith, we're waiting for you.

1194
04:43:15,099 --> 04:43:20,200
And imagine scrolling down that and being like, what the fuck is going on?

1195
04:43:37,240 --> 04:43:42,840
Oh, a unique name that it's not necessarily like gone or like Dave Smith or anything.

1196
04:43:43,959 --> 04:44:10,650
Omega Lol Dave. Why is the name Dave funny? Name. Probably should do it. Omega Lol Dave.

1197
04:44:11,450 --> 04:44:43,479
We're going. Uh huh. Drifter Cavern. No, that means it's on the other side. I really wonder

1198
04:44:43,479 --> 04:44:56,650
if I'm going to be able to do this. This is the last real roadblock before bail. That's not true.

1199
04:44:57,610 --> 04:45:00,569
List of the tormentor is the last roadblock.

1200
04:45:18,139 --> 04:45:53,400
There's a chest right there. I'll take it. I need revives. Good chest.

1201
04:45:55,130 --> 04:46:00,919
What? Ooh, I heard a skull. Why don't I hear a skull? Oh, it's down here.

1202
04:46:00,919 --> 04:46:27,979
Okay, don't worry. We will level up before I do the ancients. I just want to because

1203
04:46:27,979 --> 04:46:33,340
if you, when you go into the ancients, you get one shot. If you try to portal out,

1204
04:46:33,340 --> 04:46:45,830
the whole encounter resets. So you pick up, you put a portal. Although you otherwise have to run

1205
04:46:45,830 --> 04:46:55,659
the whole thing. Yeah. This is going to suck. It has to be down here. Remember, we'll literally

1206
04:46:55,659 --> 04:47:00,619
never say penis. He's too pure for this world. I've said that, like I've said that word. It's

1207
04:47:00,619 --> 04:47:29,740
anatomy. What? Who cares? Like guys, it's all right to say vagina. That's anatomy too, right?

1208
04:47:29,740 --> 04:48:02,389
Yeah. That's what doesn't matter. I don't get it. Wink already. You want to see where my gamer

1209
04:48:02,389 --> 04:48:12,040
face is? Like this is where I have to pay attention. Right there. Just pretend I'm on face cam.

1210
04:48:13,000 --> 04:48:27,130
Wait, where the hell is this? Wait, what the fuck? I need the ancients way. Wait, is it frozen

1211
04:48:27,130 --> 04:48:43,240
Tundra? Did I miss one? Is it frozen Tundra? Then to, I don't remember. Frozen Tundra?

1212
04:48:44,360 --> 04:48:54,619
And then ancients way. Yeah. Damn it. Yeah. Ancient's way. All right. Ancient's way. Let's

1213
04:48:54,619 --> 04:49:10,860
find it. I actually cannot just go through this. I might be able to just run to get it.

1214
04:49:10,860 --> 04:49:19,560
It's like right around here. Look at me. Look at how fast I am. No one will catch me. I have

1215
04:49:19,560 --> 04:49:42,150
65% increased speed. Good luck. Ain't nobody catching me. I could run a mile. Iron Man's

1216
04:49:42,150 --> 04:50:04,520
going to protect you. It's going to be all right. Although I have to be careful that I'm running a

1217
04:50:04,520 --> 04:50:24,310
stamina. I will not get hurt until, unless I have no stamina. Here we go. It should be right here.

1218
04:50:30,009 --> 04:50:33,770
Here it is right here. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do this right. Do this right.

1219
04:50:33,770 --> 04:50:51,290
Do this right. Do this smart. This is where I die. This is smart. Like anyone's going to click on

1220
04:50:51,290 --> 04:51:18,250
curses. Where do you want to go? You've had stretching. You've had 34 opportunities to

1221
04:51:18,250 --> 04:51:26,759
click a curse and you haven't done it once. So trying to get me killed. It's all right.

1222
04:51:27,639 --> 04:52:29,770
A little late for teeth, isn't it? Apparently not to, uh, 48% of everybody watching the channel

1223
04:52:29,770 --> 04:53:06,470
right now. It seems like the perfect time. Vitality. Four to six damage. Four teeth.

1224
04:53:15,380 --> 04:53:32,340
These potions. Okay, let's go get an army. Dude, that's like 24 damage.

1225
04:53:34,439 --> 04:53:48,889
That's pretty, it's pretty sick. That should be enough. Actually. Yeah, that should be okay.

1226
04:53:48,889 --> 04:54:12,540
As long as I have like five people, it should be all right. Okay. Where we at?

1227
04:54:14,060 --> 04:54:33,639
Where we at guys? We good? We're good. Kill these champions. They might drop good shit.

1228
04:54:38,709 --> 04:55:06,409
Come on here. I'm overburnt. Ancient's Way. We are the spirits of the Nephalem.

1229
04:55:07,450 --> 04:56:05,180
Cool. I'm gonna have to use it again. Amulet. Should I fill the whole Ancient's Way area with

1230
04:56:05,180 --> 04:56:17,740
trash and do iron golem again? Because you have to activate it. What if I just drop like a hundred

1231
04:56:17,740 --> 04:56:33,580
weapons on the ground? I think that's the only way this is doable. Unless, I mean, Vic might be able

1232
04:56:33,580 --> 04:56:57,369
to handle it. Vic actually probably can do it. As long as I keep him healed. Level up too. Good.

1233
04:57:01,930 --> 04:57:23,959
Ow. Big Vic energy. That's right. Who is killing fire golems so hard? Who is destroying them?

1234
04:57:23,959 --> 04:57:51,380
This is kind of ass kicked. Icy cellar. That's not correct. That means it's over here.

1235
04:57:56,099 --> 04:58:24,150
Harriet Summit. I forgot. That's, okay, let me explain something very quickly.

1236
04:58:27,770 --> 04:58:35,779
You put that there on, if you're not playing hardcore, because portals are not allowed here,

1237
04:58:36,419 --> 04:58:50,169
but you can come back through the portal and walk in again. I can do this, but if this has started,

1238
04:58:50,889 --> 04:59:14,409
I can't use it. You have to do it in one shot. Oh my god. I didn't get any waypoints.

1239
04:59:15,209 --> 04:59:25,580
I didn't get any waypoints. I'd have to run the whole thing. Fuck. How did that, that was just,

1240
04:59:25,580 --> 04:59:31,500
that, like, two unfortunate things in a row. I could leave and just come back. Why did I use,

1241
04:59:31,500 --> 04:59:39,020
I was just showing people, I don't know. I thought I had like a thousand. Okay. Um, I, I know,

1242
04:59:43,669 --> 05:00:19,270
salutations. It ain't gonna end like that. It's a big Vic energy. I mean, at the end of the day,

1243
05:00:19,990 --> 05:00:25,130
at the end of the day, I have to just go for it. And I'm, okay, let me ask a question.

1244
05:00:26,549 --> 05:00:33,419
Am I allowed to port out? Because if I use a portal, everything resets. Am I allowed to do that?

1245
05:00:37,369 --> 05:01:13,189
No. I'm seeing a lot of nos. Open the fucking door. We'll do a proper poll. You see, if I'm

1246
05:01:13,189 --> 05:01:28,020
allowed to portal out of the Ancients, you're supposed to do it in one go. Ancients way. Watch

1247
05:01:28,020 --> 05:02:17,259
that stamina. All right. I just have to get up there. Just get up there. Fucking god. These

1248
05:02:17,259 --> 05:02:24,470
skeletons are getting beat so badly. These skeletons aren't good anymore. They used to be good.

1249
05:02:24,470 --> 05:02:39,880
What happened to them? They used to be so good. They can't take any punches anymore. Oh shit.

1250
05:02:40,599 --> 05:02:52,580
All right. This is blocked off. Chad Barbarian Ancients versus the Virgin Bone Boys.

1251
05:03:06,150 --> 05:03:22,380
Not that way. It's the other side. Is it? Yep. Here it is. The summit. Let's hang out right here.

1252
05:03:22,380 --> 05:03:32,389
Put a portal. Let's go for it. Let's get a full team. I might, I might just be overthinking this.

1253
05:03:32,389 --> 05:03:38,409
We might be able to do this. We might just be able to do this with a full team. It's possible.

1254
05:03:39,049 --> 05:04:13,619
I'll give it a try. I want a full team and I want two moon, uh, moon lords. Okay. How many we got?

1255
05:04:13,619 --> 05:04:23,380
Four. We got everybody. We got two moon lords. We have two something. Let's go. Let's do it.

1256
05:04:23,380 --> 05:04:43,580
I'm ready. You ready? Let's go. First try. Oh no, it's Bugleberry.

1257
05:04:44,139 --> 05:05:37,849
Focus one. Focus one. Get a moon lord. Come on. He said E3 gameplay.

1258
05:05:41,580 --> 05:05:53,560
Kill this one. Somebody's dead. Who's dead? They're both dead. Oh, we did it. We definitely did it.

1259
05:05:53,560 --> 05:06:01,979
It's over. I just did it. How many level? What level am I? 34? 35. Oh, that was a bogus. I did it.

1260
05:06:01,979 --> 05:06:45,580
I was not even, but yeah, I was overthinking that. Kill Bale. Let's do it. No one's going to

1261
05:06:45,580 --> 05:06:57,740
click on curses. You know it. Respec skills before Bale. Please. I, I can't do that. That

1262
05:06:57,740 --> 05:07:05,740
defeats the whole purpose of these streams. Could I just go delete everything or you guys have picked

1263
05:07:06,299 --> 05:07:13,340
and do a real build and kill Bale? But no, this is hardcore. Chat picks every skill and stat.

1264
05:07:13,900 --> 05:07:39,689
Can I beat the game on hardcore? It's important. All right, it's revive. That's three revives.

1265
05:07:40,650 --> 05:07:55,860
Very cool. These might be one of the, this probably only give you probably about five,

1266
05:07:55,860 --> 05:08:07,860
four or five more levels left in the remainder of the whole game. Chat, get bone mastery you zoomers.

1267
05:08:09,380 --> 05:08:21,209
Thankfully vitality is still on the brains. That's good. Okay, let's go.

1268
05:08:22,169 --> 05:08:55,659
Three summons. Next one is four. The world stone keep. Bale. The gates of sesharon have been close

1269
05:08:55,659 --> 05:09:16,779
for Eon. You will not open them now. Come on Vic. I need you down here. Well, that was easy.

1270
05:09:17,580 --> 05:09:31,139
World stone keep level two. We need the, we need, very important, we need the waypoint. It's going

1271
05:09:31,220 --> 05:09:37,930
to be a normal enemy that kills you. No, it's not. I've gotten this far. This is what hours,

1272
05:09:37,930 --> 05:09:45,240
it's been five hours. This is, is this the third or fourth Diablo two hardcore stream? Third,

1273
05:09:45,240 --> 05:09:59,369
right? The fourth is the third. So in like 14 hours, 15, 16 hours of gameplay, you think that

1274
05:09:59,369 --> 05:10:08,500
at this point, a greater hell spawn is going to kill me. I mean, that's field play is awesome.

1275
05:10:09,139 --> 05:10:29,900
More summons. Three. Good. We need the waypoint. These guys do explode, so I can't see your

1276
05:10:29,900 --> 05:10:38,419
concern. You're going to get too full of yourself and you're going to get cornered.

1277
05:10:40,200 --> 05:10:48,009
I don't know if I will. I'd like to level up once or twice though before Bale, which the

1278
05:10:48,009 --> 05:11:03,560
throne room should. The throne room is a EXP heaven and we get to hear the laugh. The best part of all

1279
05:11:03,560 --> 05:11:24,569
of act five. I thought you were one of my friends. Get out of here. I thought that guy was on my team.

1280
05:11:32,220 --> 05:11:40,840
Need to do a potion run here in a minute. Hey, listen, it's a login screen.

1281
05:11:58,659 --> 05:12:02,490
Full team. I need a mage. I don't think there's anything over here.

1282
05:12:10,970 --> 05:12:25,500
Bastard sword. Nope. We angry. We want teeth. Your rage is going to consume you.

1283
05:12:28,119 --> 05:12:36,540
Waypoint or level three? Waypoint. All right. We are now good to go. The final waypoint of the game.

1284
05:12:38,229 --> 05:12:42,069
Very useful if I ever want to do this again and come back and kill Bale for any reason.

1285
05:12:42,790 --> 05:13:07,180
So it's down bottom right. Like this way. I'm scared of list of the tormentor.

1286
05:13:09,740 --> 05:13:28,869
Like kill Bale music. Why? Oh, it's kill Bale music. What do you want me to play?

1287
05:13:29,430 --> 05:13:40,549
Oh, here we go. All right. One more level and we're at the throne room. You want to

1288
05:13:40,549 --> 05:13:45,189
play like the theme song and hold on. You want me to play the kill Bale theme song and have me get

1289
05:13:45,270 --> 05:14:00,360
muted. The apex of this whole stream series. I don't think that's a good idea.

1290
05:14:01,080 --> 05:14:33,060
We're going to have Diablo music. Throne room. We've probably going to level up two or three

1291
05:14:33,060 --> 05:14:38,279
times in the throne room. At least once. It's not this way. So what the hell am I even doing down

1292
05:14:38,279 --> 05:14:49,930
here? Does Mike just vibrate or am I imagining it? It probably didn't. Why fucking not? Hey,

1293
05:14:49,930 --> 05:14:54,090
don't pay attention to run down a hallway. What am I thinking? What are you doing?

1294
05:14:54,889 --> 05:15:32,919
There it is. I can see it. Ball hacks. We just need a good portal and we need to pray.

1295
05:15:48,889 --> 05:15:58,090
Throne of destruction. Kill Bale's minions and then kill Bale.

1296
05:15:58,889 --> 05:16:18,580
This is going to be fun. Win or lose. No matter. Win or lose. We made it.

1297
05:16:20,020 --> 05:16:26,889
10 community subs from FurtBernandes. Thank you Bert or Furt. FurtBernandes. Thanks a lot Bert.

1298
05:16:27,529 --> 05:16:48,150
Appreciate the subs. Thanks for the 10. All right. I need potions for this. Good potions.

1299
05:16:48,150 --> 05:17:13,299
Not these shitty ones. Okay. This part is uh you fight waves of enemies.

1300
05:17:14,180 --> 05:17:23,880
Just clear it out first. It's kind of a pain in the ass. Adventures of flying Jack like Kevin

1301
05:17:23,880 --> 05:17:35,659
McCloud. Let's do it. You're going to see him. He's scary looking. I have to warn you. He's

1302
05:17:35,659 --> 05:18:03,139
scary looking. Open my eyes. All right. I'll tell you when to open your eyes so you won't see the

1303
05:18:03,139 --> 05:18:24,330
scary monster. Open him now. All right. Everybody get in there. He spawns people right here. Hit it.

1304
05:18:26,040 --> 05:18:49,939
This is the exp heaven. Although there's only one person in the game. Me. We're good. I feel much

1305
05:18:49,939 --> 05:19:12,779
stronger. Good. Are you outpacing me? Am I being outleveled by my apprentice? Boys it sucks. That

1306
05:19:12,779 --> 05:20:04,659
was act two. Here comes act three. Counsel. Hey. Why don't we go out the back door and make some new

1307
05:20:04,659 --> 05:20:40,459
friends? Okay. A couple of mages. Let's go. Hey. We have a full team of friends. Remember somebody

1308
05:20:40,459 --> 05:20:54,419
said that fireman was bad. Um, what are they? What are they? Nuts? Back into it. Focus one.

1309
05:20:58,580 --> 05:21:02,419
Revive a council member. No, don't blow them up. They've made it ice. Oh God.

1310
05:21:02,419 --> 05:21:25,590
There's nobody to revive. How? Revive a council member. Finally. Here comes act four. I don't have

1311
05:21:26,150 --> 05:21:59,110
the skeletons are worthless, but they take, they take one hit of damage each. That means that seven

1312
05:22:00,119 --> 05:22:05,319
swings that I don't have to see or the other actually good companions don't have to see.

1313
05:22:06,520 --> 05:22:35,270
Okay. Let's go. I need mana. All right. See if I can get through act. So fucking dead.

1314
05:22:37,319 --> 05:22:48,169
Hey, at least you got to see veil. Have a good night. Everybody still have a council member. So

1315
05:22:53,750 --> 05:23:02,200
one, two, three. All right. Everybody's stuff in the middle. Get the council member in there.

1316
05:23:02,200 --> 05:23:23,750
He's the most, he's the strongest one. Get in there. Oh, kill somebody. I can revive someone.

1317
05:23:36,819 --> 05:24:07,270
Good. There we go. Look at these revives doing work. Okay. This is it. This is the last wave

1318
05:24:07,270 --> 05:24:30,299
and it's the worst one. I have three. Stay in there. Come on. Vic's dead. Vic's dead. I still

1319
05:24:30,299 --> 05:24:43,000
have my three, my three. Come on, kill one so I can bring one back to life. Anyone.

1320
05:24:44,200 --> 05:24:56,099
Nobody even has any health taken away. Get away from me. He tried your best. Um, he tried your

1321
05:24:56,099 --> 05:25:15,180
best. You couldn't hurt him. And now I'm going in there with no beefy minions. I said you

1322
05:25:15,180 --> 05:25:26,919
shouldn't be giving blizzard any, uh, was there any what? Any advertisement? Um, I've kind of

1323
05:25:26,919 --> 05:25:37,099
been talking shit about blizzard from five streams. I think, I think every time we've talked about

1324
05:25:37,099 --> 05:25:42,220
anything to do with blizzard, I've, I've made a comment about how bad of a company they are.

1325
05:25:43,020 --> 05:25:56,569
Blizzard north made this game. That's like a totally different company.

1326
05:26:02,150 --> 05:26:18,700
I'm not, I'm going to get fucking wrecked in here. Yeah. Go to river of flame. That's,

1327
05:26:18,700 --> 05:26:33,979
that's a good idea. I really want to kill this thing. Blizzard north. Yeah. That's a sad tale.

1328
05:26:34,540 --> 05:26:41,689
Blizzard north made Diablo and Diablo two. And then the entire company was liquidated

1329
05:26:43,110 --> 05:26:51,819
for some reason. Let me, do I have anything? Blizzard just got rid of blizzard north.

1330
05:26:52,459 --> 05:26:56,060
They were just like, yeah, we don't want blizzard north anymore. What is it going to get rid of them?

1331
05:26:56,060 --> 05:27:12,009
They used to be called condor before blizzard bought them. Yeah. And we got hell gate London.

1332
05:27:14,759 --> 05:27:20,139
Yeah. But what they were responsible for torchlight, weren't they? Wasn't one of them,

1333
05:27:20,860 --> 05:27:24,700
didn't one of them go on to one of the two or three people that made, uh,

1334
05:27:25,340 --> 05:27:34,950
Diablo go on to do torchlight. They just, the, the D it's like, we talked about this before.

1335
05:27:34,950 --> 05:27:40,810
It's like Chrono trigger. You had this perfect team and they all, from the artists, the designers

1336
05:27:40,810 --> 05:27:45,849
to the programmers, to the people making the engine, like that you had this group and they

1337
05:27:45,849 --> 05:27:50,409
all were really good. And then you split them all up and they all do their own version of the same

1338
05:27:50,409 --> 05:27:55,430
thing. And it's not as good as the, when you were all together doing the same thing together,

1339
05:27:55,430 --> 05:28:04,250
unfortunately. That's why we'll never get another Chrono trigger or a sequel because they're all

1340
05:28:04,250 --> 05:28:11,270
split up and they're all completely different companies in different places. So we will, you'll,

1341
05:28:11,270 --> 05:28:23,459
we will never get a true sequel to any of these games. Unfortunately. God, I hate video games.

1342
05:28:23,459 --> 05:28:30,810
That was funny. All right. I need to go to act four and revive. This is a fucking, this is a joke.

1343
05:28:30,810 --> 05:28:52,380
All right. Wait, I need Vic. I'm nothing without Vic. So let's revive a few people here. I think

1344
05:28:52,380 --> 05:29:03,209
I can actually go try to fight bail without fighting these things. See if I can get a couple

1345
05:29:03,209 --> 05:29:13,130
of this nights. I'm pretty sure I can just run into the gate. This nights are really good.

1346
05:29:13,849 --> 05:29:37,049
Oh, I got a bug. I'm on another wrist night. I'll take these three. Okay. One more this night and

1347
05:29:37,049 --> 05:29:44,599
I'll be good to go. Should be all right. And it didn't ogre. No, I want all ogres blowing them up.

1348
05:29:45,319 --> 05:30:12,150
Three ogres. Don't blow them up. I need him. My God. You fucking idiots. All right. Let's go.

1349
05:30:12,790 --> 05:30:30,860
I'm just going to, I got an ogre, an ogre. I have two bugs, two small bugs.

1350
05:30:42,229 --> 05:30:49,319
God damn it. Fuck it. Let's go. Who cares? Let's go. Whatever. I'm going in.

1351
05:30:50,119 --> 05:31:13,400
I'm going in. Wait, why was the portal in the middle? Why was the portal in the center

1352
05:31:14,340 --> 05:31:38,119
of everybody? Look at all the money I dropped. All right. Am I insane or wasn't the portal down

1353
05:31:38,119 --> 05:32:03,259
here? The portal was down here. When did it come up here? Oh, okay. Three. It was, wasn't it? Three

1354
05:32:03,259 --> 05:32:13,720
Winx redeemed. Check the VOD. You moved it. Did I? But why would I? Okay. I don't know. Would I have

1355
05:32:13,720 --> 05:32:19,720
been this dumb to put them? I wouldn't have put it like right in the middle. At least like,

1356
05:32:20,680 --> 05:32:28,759
that wouldn't have done that. You were rushing. It's because I got two maggots and I just wanted

1357
05:32:28,759 --> 05:32:47,159
to go in and ugh. Your deeds of valor will be remembered. You have died. Call me Lee Bones. Dead.

1358
05:32:47,720 --> 05:33:02,200
You cannot create or join with a dead hardcore character. That was a good run. All right. That

1359
05:33:02,200 --> 05:33:10,709
was, at least you got to see Vale. Take a pee break. We'll be right back. See what I'm going to do.

1360
05:33:11,750 --> 05:33:18,060
I, what time is it? No, actually I have to leave. Wait, it's been five and a half hours. Holy shit.

1361
05:33:18,060 --> 05:33:27,349
Okay. I have to go. Not immediately, but I have to leave like soonish. Uh, let's go pee. I'll be

1362
05:33:27,349 --> 05:33:39,130
right back. We will, we will settle. We can hang up for like another 45 minutes or so. Just about.

1363
05:33:39,770 --> 05:33:42,380
See what we can do in that time. I'll be right back. Let me just go pee.

1364
05:34:17,669 --> 05:35:51,189
Bro, I'm so late. Did he beat the huge red guy yet? I did actually. Uh, that's the last one.

1365
05:35:51,189 --> 05:35:58,860
I'm going in. My theory. Okay. Here's my theory with what happened right there.

1366
05:35:59,740 --> 05:36:03,580
I was going to try to pull them out because you don't have to kill them.

1367
05:36:05,139 --> 05:36:10,020
And I figured if I pull them out, I can get into the chamber where Bale was,

1368
05:36:11,060 --> 05:36:14,979
make a portal in the chamber, and then figure out what the hell I was going to do.

1369
05:36:15,779 --> 05:36:27,720
I guess, I guess I made a portal in the middle of everybody somehow. Did I like panic or something

1370
05:36:27,720 --> 05:36:37,159
halfway through that? I don't know. All right. Let's uh, Tommy Lee bones is level 35. He's gone.

1371
05:36:37,720 --> 05:36:45,319
That was a lot of fun though. I did not think I was going to get that far.

1372
05:36:45,319 --> 05:36:50,889
Not a chance in hell. It sounded like you were getting murdered in real life too.

1373
05:36:55,529 --> 05:37:03,299
Yeah. And I'm going to call it here. I might as well. Just because this stream was only going

1374
05:37:03,299 --> 05:37:12,310
to be about four to six hours because I have to go meet. I have to go meet friends. Some of you

1375
05:37:12,310 --> 05:37:17,270
guys don't know, but this is the stream where I have to say goodbye for a little while.

1376
05:37:20,490 --> 05:37:32,520
I will be back next week. It's probably on Friday afternoon. You will not see me for about six days.

1377
05:37:33,560 --> 05:37:39,299
I have a group of friends that are coming up from Boston. First time any of them have,

1378
05:37:39,299 --> 05:37:44,979
some of them at least have been out here. Um, first time anyone of any of them have come to visit

1379
05:37:44,979 --> 05:37:49,220
me in particular, except for one of them has come out once, but the most part, no.

1380
05:37:49,220 --> 05:37:59,880
So we're going to have some enjoyable friend time. So you will not see me again. They are here.

1381
05:38:01,659 --> 05:38:05,020
They knew I, you know, obviously that I wasn't going to be available till a little bit later,

1382
05:38:05,819 --> 05:38:13,750
but it is now later. So at 8 PM Pacific is when I need to essentially meet them.

1383
05:38:13,750 --> 05:38:27,029
I'm just snort cocaine. No, I do not do drugs. I do not do them. I thought we were your friends.

1384
05:38:27,990 --> 05:38:38,279
Yeah. But, uh, we'll do the bits. We'll hang out for a little bit. If you're taking off,

1385
05:38:39,540 --> 05:38:45,159
thanks for joining me these last five days. These streams have been very fun.

1386
05:38:45,159 --> 05:38:51,860
I've had a blast on all of them. For those of you Assura's Wrath fans that thought maybe today,

1387
05:38:51,860 --> 05:38:56,340
if we had time, we were going to do DLC, I was under the impression that if I didn't kill Diablo

1388
05:38:56,979 --> 05:39:00,580
and I just couldn't do it and I died within like two hours that we would have done it,

1389
05:39:02,180 --> 05:39:07,540
but there's still a lot of Xbox stuff to do. Assura's Wrath DLC will be tacked onto one of

1390
05:39:07,540 --> 05:39:20,659
the Xbox 360 games when we go back to it. When am I going to stream next? I'll be back on Friday.

1391
05:39:22,250 --> 05:39:36,630
So Friday the 7th is when I will return. Don't forget about me. Don't forget about me.

1392
05:39:36,630 --> 05:39:49,290
And that's going to call it tonight. Time to rewatch the Sorcery VODs. Oh, that was

1393
05:39:49,290 --> 05:39:55,220
some of my first streams. It was a lot of fun. As always, thanks for joining me, everybody. Let's

1394
05:39:55,220 --> 05:40:01,909
do the bits. Thanks for joining me. Again, a lot of people watched these Diablo 2 streams.

1395
05:40:06,819 --> 05:40:09,540
I'm happy about that. I'm happy that people are still interested.

1396
05:40:13,110 --> 05:40:18,330
This is like one of my favorite games ever. It's nice to share that with people.

1397
05:40:24,819 --> 05:40:35,610
Play Diablo 3? I'm not going to play Diablo 3 on stream. But thank you. I will see you all next

1398
05:40:35,610 --> 05:40:42,549
week. But Isaac, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey, Jeremy, I wanted to thank you again for the

1399
05:40:42,549 --> 05:40:48,619
laughs from last night's stream. I haven't laughed like that in a long time. Yeah. All right. Last

1400
05:40:48,619 --> 05:40:54,150
night's stream was very funny. When I got to the point where we were 10 hours in, 10 and a half

1401
05:40:54,150 --> 05:41:02,180
hours, and Iron Man did the royal flush and hit his face on the bar, I was gone. I literally was

1402
05:41:02,180 --> 05:41:11,049
in outer space. I was gone. It was just so stupid. I loved every second of it. Yeah. I had a lot of

1403
05:41:11,049 --> 05:41:19,500
fun. It's a great game. It's one of the best skating games. Glad you enjoyed it. Esquilo,

1404
05:41:19,500 --> 05:41:23,259
thanks for the 300 bits. Jeremy, I had a dream last night where you were my brother and I came

1405
05:41:23,259 --> 05:41:28,779
to visit you and Kim. It was an hour before TwitchCon and I was ready, except I had to pee.

1406
05:41:29,500 --> 05:41:33,340
When I got to the bathroom and zipped my pants to pee, you came in naked to take a shower.

1407
05:41:34,060 --> 05:41:39,659
I asked you what the fuck you were doing and why it was all see-through glass. You answered it was

1408
05:41:39,659 --> 05:41:50,090
Kim's idea of having a bathroom like this. And you had a massive, I had very large hands.

1409
05:41:51,540 --> 05:42:01,979
Weird. Thank you. Thank you for thanking people for their dreams. Hey, thanks. Thank you for your

1410
05:42:01,979 --> 05:42:09,610
dream. Thanks for the dream. Thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it. Don't eat macaroni and cheese

1411
05:42:09,610 --> 05:42:20,700
after 11 o'clock. Silent Serenity, thanks for 250. I once sold my soul to a guy on TF2 for a couple

1412
05:42:20,700 --> 05:42:34,810
of reclaimed. He emailed me a contract to sign and everything. Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for 500 bits.

1413
05:42:34,810 --> 05:42:40,169
I heard you looked hot today. Read about it in a Discord chat. I hope it's true, but I can't stay.

1414
05:42:40,169 --> 05:42:54,229
Have a good stream. Well, I don't know. You may never know if that was true or not.

1415
05:42:59,509 --> 05:43:07,400
50 community subs. Let's talk about it one more time. Zyxia dropped 50. Monster sub dropped

1416
05:43:09,020 --> 05:43:29,340
earlier. Thank you so much, Zyxia. Say it right. Say the name right. I always say people's names

1417
05:43:29,340 --> 05:43:46,950
wrong. I'm sorry. Say my name right. I can't. Hikikomoris Sunday. Zyxia, I can't do it. People

1418
05:43:46,950 --> 05:44:14,759
in chat keep calling me Morris. Wait, Hikikomoris Sunday. It's not Morris. Dude, people keep calling

1419
05:44:14,759 --> 05:44:25,529
me fucking Morris, man. Like, get it right. Sorry. But regardless, it was a shitload of subs. A ton.

1420
05:44:26,569 --> 05:44:33,139
No one's ever expected to even sub to this channel, let alone give 50 other subscriptions

1421
05:44:33,220 --> 05:44:47,770
to other people. Thank you. We had the shroom gave 370. Thank you, the shroom.

1422
05:44:57,419 --> 05:45:00,380
Oh, I thought you said now I'm developing. Now I'm getting deployed

1423
05:45:01,180 --> 05:45:04,619
to the Middle East. I'm just getting rid of the last few bits I have.

1424
05:45:05,340 --> 05:45:09,340
You all deserve so much more. I hope you see this message and understand all you've done for me and

1425
05:45:09,340 --> 05:45:16,099
countless others that have been here for so long. Even ones just starting to watch. I wish you the

1426
05:45:16,099 --> 05:45:29,590
best of luck. Take care of yourself. Thank you so much for being part of this community. If anybody

1427
05:45:29,590 --> 05:45:34,409
gets anything from these streams, I say it a lot, but it's true. If you get anything from it, good.

1428
05:45:34,409 --> 05:45:56,580
Very good. Very, very, very good. Take care of yourself. I wish you the best. I missed this.

1429
05:45:58,180 --> 05:46:02,979
I missed this message here. It was $50 earlier. I don't know. I must have been in the middle of

1430
05:46:02,979 --> 05:46:10,020
something weird. 5,000 bits from butt sniffing George. He said, Jeremy, I've been watching you

1431
05:46:10,020 --> 05:46:18,409
since you uploaded the TF2 video to Lepto1's channel in 2011 when I was 12. I want to say

1432
05:46:18,409 --> 05:46:29,500
thank you for all the content. I also wanted to embarrass you. Lepto1. We actually talked about

1433
05:46:29,500 --> 05:46:43,770
Lepto1 recently. Lepto1, I mean, to be completely honest, that was a pretty big reason why anybody

1434
05:46:43,770 --> 05:46:54,279
watched my channel when I had 200, 300 subs. I was getting maybe 500 to 1,000 views of video,

1435
05:46:55,000 --> 05:47:02,700
and he was getting 5,000 to 10,000 views of video. Maybe a little bit more, and it was like,

1436
05:47:02,700 --> 05:47:11,590
holy shit. That did a lot of good early on for the channel, which is the most important thing.

1437
05:47:12,709 --> 05:47:24,169
Going from one sub to 100 subs is way harder than going from 10,000 to 50,000. That initial

1438
05:47:24,889 --> 05:47:34,229
first thousand subs on YouTube is very, very hard to get, so it did a lot. It helped a lot.

1439
05:47:37,299 --> 05:47:55,430
No shit. All right, ban that guy. Hey, we got a wink. I wonder how long it's going to take

1440
05:47:55,430 --> 05:48:02,250
before I get really sick and tired of doing that. You know what I mean? At what point is this going

1441
05:48:02,250 --> 05:48:09,380
to be like, when am I going to not want to do this anymore? Like, oh, let me turn on my webcam

1442
05:48:09,380 --> 05:48:13,799
and wink into the camera. I wonder. I'm going to give it like 30 days and see how I feel.

1443
05:48:20,619 --> 05:48:29,819
But yeah, you linked my Combat Engineer Lakeside video from Lepto1's channel. I mean, it's not

1444
05:48:29,819 --> 05:48:38,700
really, it's not going to embarrass me. It's not because this is just like 10 years ago now.

1445
05:48:38,700 --> 05:48:55,590
This is almost a decade old, 10 years, a 10 year old video. Here's the link for it. I mean,

1446
05:48:55,590 --> 05:49:00,869
I don't really want to watch it because it's, I mean, it's 10 years old and we've watched 10

1447
05:49:00,869 --> 05:49:07,319
year old videos before and I'm just like, ugh, it's all right, it's good. It was okay. Another

1448
05:49:07,319 --> 05:49:18,380
wink? What is going on? I'm sorry, I'm already sick of doing it. How long? Took like two weeks?

1449
05:49:18,939 --> 05:49:35,880
It's staying though. It's not going anywhere. The worst part about this is somebody is always

1450
05:49:35,880 --> 05:49:41,689
going to be saving channel points for the wink. So if I ever get rid of the wink,

1451
05:49:42,250 --> 05:49:47,419
it's going to be really bad because somebody's going to be mad because like there's always

1452
05:49:47,419 --> 05:50:13,029
going to be a cycling saver for saving wink points. Anyways, thank you butt sniffing George.

1453
05:50:13,669 --> 05:50:26,700
Thanks for being around for a decade. Let us get the subs rolling. I'm going to bump you again.

1454
05:50:26,700 --> 05:50:30,819
I'm just, I'm just bumping you all day, huh? I just keep bumping you in the face.

1455
05:50:31,540 --> 05:50:40,340
Please don't stop the wink. I'm almost there. You almost add enough points.

1456
05:50:40,340 --> 05:50:57,189
How did I read that? What the fuck am I doing? Thanks all the subs. We had a lot of community

1457
05:50:57,189 --> 05:51:10,700
subs tonight. Appreciate it. All of you. The community subs from New Year's Eve have turned

1458
05:51:10,700 --> 05:51:19,529
over as you can imagine. But surprisingly enough, a ton of people that were gifted subs on that

1459
05:51:19,529 --> 05:51:38,490
night stayed. Thank you guys. Over 10k, not anymore. We, the channel sits at 80, 8,300 subs,

1460
05:51:38,490 --> 05:51:52,139
which is an absolute huge amount because you got to remember before, before New Year's Eve, it was

1461
05:51:52,139 --> 05:52:03,159
like 6,000. So New Year's Eve had thousands of community subs and for that many people after to

1462
05:52:03,159 --> 05:52:18,340
stay on. It's crazy. That's a huge retention rate for somebody staying subscribed. So I wanted to

1463
05:52:18,340 --> 05:52:21,540
give you an update on that because I know we've talked about a few times. Hey, we're almost at

1464
05:52:21,540 --> 05:52:28,500
like a, we're at like, we like, I've got 10,000 subs. I've got, I'm at 11,000 subs, but you know,

1465
05:52:28,580 --> 05:52:33,500
I want to make sure everyone's, I don't want you guys to think that I'm like, hey, we're almost

1466
05:52:33,500 --> 05:52:43,299
at 12,000. Pretty good, huh? Let's go, go, go. This was kind of an interesting piece of data.

1467
05:52:43,299 --> 05:52:55,689
I thought you guys might want to know. Numbers go up hyper. A thousand of your subs of mine,

1468
05:52:55,689 --> 05:53:04,340
give them back. I kind of can't, but no, seriously. Thanks guys. 5,000 subs was a huge milestone. I

1469
05:53:04,340 --> 05:53:12,090
didn't think that it would be more than that ever. And here we are. Thank you. Scam train.

1470
05:53:12,090 --> 05:53:20,340
Yeah, I don't have scam trains turned on. Hyper train, whatever. Potion dweller, thanks for the

1471
05:53:20,340 --> 05:53:25,979
250. Attention chat, save up your winks. I would like to have an ultimate wink where we all cash in

1472
05:53:25,979 --> 05:53:32,599
our winks one after the other in two months. Start saving your points. Let's organize and make him

1473
05:53:32,599 --> 05:53:42,700
wink endlessly. That would be such a, that would be such a bad stream. But if you spend your points

1474
05:53:42,700 --> 05:53:57,180
the way you want to spend them, if you want to spend your points, if you want to spend

1475
05:53:58,060 --> 05:54:12,299
your currency wherever you want, you absolutely can. Do blinks so it's two winks at once.

1476
05:54:13,340 --> 05:54:21,099
What do you mean, oh God. What are you talking about? I said you can use your currency for

1477
05:54:21,099 --> 05:54:33,959
whatever you want on, you can use your winks however. Why is everybody monkey-essing? Sorry

1478
05:54:33,959 --> 05:54:42,520
about that. Hey RTM, thanks for the 300 bits. Watching you play Thug yesterday, maybe remember

1479
05:54:42,520 --> 05:54:47,560
an old skating group me and my dad watched years ago. I ended up spending the night watching them

1480
05:54:47,560 --> 05:54:53,240
and some of the morning too. The group is called Fancy Lad Skateboards. When I went to look up what

1481
05:54:53,240 --> 05:54:57,560
they were doing now, I saw that they are now based in the Boston area. Small world, huh?

1482
05:54:58,680 --> 05:55:03,580
Anyways, here's a link to a member showing off some of their flatland tricks.

1483
05:55:17,139 --> 05:55:30,069
It says this guy's on bath salts, apparently. Hold on, let me turn this music off. It's not

1484
05:55:30,069 --> 05:55:38,279
like a joke video, just that's the title of the video. Matt Tomasello aka Rodney Mullen on bath

1485
05:55:38,279 --> 05:56:00,229
salts. This is just here. What the fuck? Okay, the cow... Jesus. The cow throwing the rock

1486
05:56:00,790 --> 05:56:07,770
at the crowd of people was saved here. That was when Murius was like throwing shit and breaking

1487
05:56:07,770 --> 05:56:20,500
stuff. All right, let's take a look. Oh, free tax, pay zero dollars to file. Pretty good trick.

1488
05:56:21,639 --> 05:56:41,259
Actually, this is on ice. Does it have no... There's no wheels. That board is broken in half.

1489
05:56:43,180 --> 05:57:05,590
What? Is this board broken or is that separated? Hold on. Is this guy a skateboarder or is he a

1490
05:57:05,590 --> 05:57:16,549
magician? Is this like a magic guy? These are magic tricks. He has two boards in one. He has

1491
05:57:16,549 --> 05:57:31,270
like a fake tear away board that turns into a real board, but all of a sudden he just does a royal

1492
05:57:31,270 --> 05:57:40,700
flush. What? How do you even do that? That's not even possible. Humans can't do that. Gravity

1493
05:57:40,700 --> 05:57:52,259
doesn't even work that way. I'll break it. Did a smaller skateboard come out of his skateboard?

1494
05:57:53,060 --> 05:58:40,939
What the fuck? That's so funny. Live birth. Yeah, awesome. Four heads. Nice. Nice. Oh, I could just

1495
05:58:40,939 --> 05:58:55,130
sit here and just eat potato chips and watch this for like the next four hours. Good commentary.

1496
05:58:55,689 --> 05:59:17,080
Guys, huge crunching sound. Sick. That was pretty good. Yeah, it's blowing my mind. Me and my dad

1497
05:59:17,080 --> 05:59:21,639
would blast through hours of these guys. I mean, this video has a million views, so it's not

1498
05:59:21,639 --> 05:59:32,680
surprising. It's really, really cool shit. It's surprising that people watch this stuff. Crunch joke

1499
05:59:32,680 --> 05:59:43,669
incoming. Link this one? Yeah, here. Wait, the original PogChamp right there is what that is.

1500
05:59:44,470 --> 05:59:53,819
Oh no, this video was uploaded in 2018. Never mind. Never mind. For some reason I thought this

1501
05:59:53,819 --> 06:00:02,540
video was from like 2005. I don't know why. That was awesome. Here, I'll link it here.

1502
06:00:10,330 --> 06:00:20,520
That's really cool shit. That was Matt Tomasello. Matt Tomasello. Thanks for sharing that though.

1503
06:00:20,520 --> 06:00:24,919
I'm probably gonna like watch those. Not tonight because I don't know. I'm not gonna have time

1504
06:00:24,919 --> 06:00:39,799
tonight, but music was really good. That was Artyom. Thank you, Artyom. Catboy Kubey. Thanks

1505
06:00:39,799 --> 06:00:43,639
for the 250. Jerma, I love the stream and I'm looking forward to that shower stream you promised

1506
06:00:43,639 --> 06:00:54,540
us. I don't remember doing that, but hey, Sinz. Thank you Sinz for the 300 bits. Hi, Jerma. Thank

1507
06:00:54,540 --> 06:01:00,860
you so much for all the kind things you said about my art during the last community content night

1508
06:01:00,860 --> 06:01:07,060
stream. I love to have your streams up while I work. Shout out to the lovely Discord community,

1509
06:01:07,299 --> 06:01:15,029
what is your favorite kind of fan art? I don't really have a favorite, but if I had to pick,

1510
06:01:15,029 --> 06:01:23,500
if you were like, pick now, go. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to influence any community

1511
06:01:23,500 --> 06:01:36,459
content. I like it all. I think it's all good stuff. I don't want to influence anybody's work.

1512
06:01:37,419 --> 06:01:48,150
I'd like to see what you come up with. There you go. But no, I love that shit. I'm glad that

1513
06:01:48,150 --> 06:01:54,950
that's something to do because before it was, I don't want to say the word sweeping it under the

1514
06:01:54,950 --> 06:02:02,439
rug, but images would come in and it would be right now the end of the stream. The stream's over.

1515
06:02:03,750 --> 06:02:09,189
Half the audience that was here for the stream has left and I just kind of open it and go,

1516
06:02:09,189 --> 06:02:15,259
oh, that's pretty, that's really good stuff. Good work. And then I close it. So having a place

1517
06:02:15,979 --> 06:02:20,709
where I can actually, that's the whole point. Everybody knows that's what's going to happen

1518
06:02:20,709 --> 06:02:25,939
and that's why they're all here. People are just, that's what we're doing today.

1519
06:02:26,580 --> 06:02:39,369
It's a much better idea. It's crazy how half the viewers leave and miss so much. Yeah, but

1520
06:02:41,340 --> 06:02:48,869
if you have, I mean, I'm not going to say you always stay, you have to stay and stay at the

1521
06:02:48,869 --> 06:02:54,790
post stream kind of chill discussion talk session. Some people want to watch the stream. They want to

1522
06:02:54,790 --> 06:02:59,110
see, oh, you're playing this or you're doing this and then you're done. All right. I'm leaving.

1523
06:02:59,189 --> 06:03:04,790
That's all right. Not for everybody. You know, you don't have to sit here and just watch a screen

1524
06:03:04,790 --> 06:03:09,700
like this and listen to me talk for like 30, 40 minutes while we go over messages and stuff.

1525
06:03:09,700 --> 06:03:14,840
That's fine. More than 3000, more than 3000 people still here. It's a lot of people just

1526
06:03:14,840 --> 06:03:21,099
are hanging out and just talking about nothing. Like I do a lot of times. I will just go off

1527
06:03:21,099 --> 06:03:27,299
and just start talking about anything or nothing during these things. And then of course we have

1528
06:03:27,299 --> 06:03:35,580
the people's donations and sub messages coming too. So it's all good. You don't, you don't have

1529
06:03:35,580 --> 06:03:42,360
to stay. You do, you do. And if you don't, you don't scream about nothing. Seinfeld,

1530
06:03:46,150 --> 06:03:49,909
swiggity swanky. Thanks to the two 50. I know you're a big guy on Twitch and very busy

1531
06:03:49,909 --> 06:03:53,990
because you are popular, but have you ever seen this clip of the, of the scout,

1532
06:03:56,409 --> 06:04:00,490
of, uh, what Nathan doing something? Would you and Jerma stream together again? I would. Absolutely.

1533
06:04:01,450 --> 06:04:05,830
Jerma is way bigger than me. So he's way hard to get away. Harder to get a hold of you guys.

1534
06:04:05,830 --> 06:04:10,310
I'm available. Jerma to get a hold of me and that you want to see a stream. I am happy to do it.

1535
06:04:11,270 --> 06:04:17,029
There you go. I think of a co-op is like,

1536
06:04:18,439 --> 06:04:27,299
got to find like the right co-op thing to do. Hey fellas, he's available. That clip is over a year

1537
06:04:27,299 --> 06:04:36,310
old. Oh, that hurt. That clip is a year old. He didn't wait. He didn't say this like last weekend.

1538
06:04:39,509 --> 06:04:49,029
This clip, wait, this clip didn't happen at like four o'clock today. I am available a year later.

1539
06:04:49,029 --> 06:04:59,509
He's been emailing you for years. Uh, no, I mean, if something comes up to do, uh,

1540
06:04:59,509 --> 06:05:08,970
I just need some co-op thing to do. Look, italics is right here over there and all the time we're

1541
06:05:08,970 --> 06:05:11,610
just like, you want to, we have everything we can, you have any co-op stuff we could do? And it's

1542
06:05:11,610 --> 06:05:29,419
just like, no, not really. SWAT4. They just think about SWAT4. Actually, I talked to Star today

1543
06:05:29,419 --> 06:05:36,200
about this. Star and I have been trying to play SWAT4 for five years. We actually talked about

1544
06:05:36,200 --> 06:05:46,729
it today that you can actually do it now. We have been trying to play this game somehow for five

1545
06:05:46,729 --> 06:06:02,250
years. Is there a stream that's been five years in the making? Uh, it wasn't going to be a stream.

1546
06:06:02,330 --> 06:06:07,959
It was going to be a video. Whether it was, uh, Star was going to be the one making it or I was,

1547
06:06:09,099 --> 06:06:24,740
we were going to make a video on SWAT4. Guys, this is like 2013 or 2014. First upload on the

1548
06:06:24,740 --> 06:06:32,200
main channel in three years now. I can't believe it. Hey, man, German, German Nathan. Oh yeah. Hey,

1549
06:06:32,200 --> 06:06:44,099
here's a clip. I thought this was from like a week ago or something, but co-op games are fun. But

1550
06:06:44,099 --> 06:06:47,700
like I said before, we already went over it, but we'll go over it one more time.

1551
06:06:48,740 --> 06:06:57,580
I just mainly do my own thing. Maybe like once every couple months there is a multiplayer kind

1552
06:06:57,580 --> 06:07:07,099
of co-op stream. Just kind of do my own thing. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to do them,

1553
06:07:07,099 --> 06:07:13,099
right? Me and Joel played, keep talking, nobody explodes, you know, and whatever,

1554
06:07:13,099 --> 06:07:16,939
whatever happens happens. We just keep going. Music is gone. We don't even need it right now.

1555
06:07:16,939 --> 06:07:30,680
I'm talking to you personally right now. Just once I want the rat to get the popcorn.

1556
06:07:31,720 --> 06:07:36,860
Not good for rats, but you're not supposed to eat it. It's supposed to eat berries and celery

1557
06:07:37,419 --> 06:07:50,709
or whatever rats eat. Yeah. I will use the same streamer blanket statement. Like I said before,

1558
06:07:51,349 --> 06:07:58,869
I love playing with people. I love streaming. For the most part, I do streams alone, unless of

1559
06:07:58,869 --> 06:08:01,990
course there's some big event going on where multiple people are going to be involved.

1560
06:08:02,790 --> 06:08:11,099
Eat an onion, eat an onion on stream. I don't think I can even eat a raw onion. It'd probably

1561
06:08:11,099 --> 06:08:20,389
be bad for me. That's very edgy, dude. Just me alone. Let's do my own thing. I'm alone loner.

1562
06:08:25,020 --> 06:08:28,459
Hey, gnarly. Thanks for the 250. I love these streams where you play a game you loved when

1563
06:08:28,459 --> 06:08:32,459
you were younger. They're still, they're very chill. Nice to watch you not suck at something.

1564
06:08:33,099 --> 06:08:37,819
Hope you do more in the future. Have a good week. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that.

1565
06:08:42,169 --> 06:08:46,569
Kiari, thanks for the 500 bits. A shame to see you lose right at the end, Jerma.

1566
06:08:47,130 --> 06:08:51,930
It was a good run. Just want to thank you. You help us all out so much by making us smile.

1567
06:08:51,930 --> 06:08:56,330
My grandfather passed away tonight and it helps having you stream around to ease pains like that.

1568
06:08:57,130 --> 06:09:04,650
Thank you for the great stream as always. I'm sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace.

1569
06:09:05,209 --> 06:09:17,959
Losing a family member is always very hard. I wish you the best. Thanks for hanging out.

1570
06:09:18,520 --> 06:09:30,459
Stick around. Stick around. What's the matter? What? You want to get out of here?

1571
06:09:31,099 --> 06:09:37,689
You want to get out of here? Yeah. I'm gonna get out. He wanted to come in. Now he wants to get out.

1572
06:09:38,650 --> 06:09:42,099
He's like, let me in. And he's like, let me out. He's like, let me in. He's like, let me out.

1573
06:09:42,900 --> 06:09:49,819
He must have. What? You want to leave now? He's like, just. All right. Hold on. One sec.

1574
06:10:18,569 --> 06:10:25,849
He wanted to go see Kim. He heard Kim. He's like, I want to be out there. Like, you're boring.

1575
06:10:26,810 --> 06:10:35,430
Let's go. But let's keep going. Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 500 bits. Enjoy your time off.

1576
06:10:35,430 --> 06:10:48,119
See you Friday. See you Friday. I will be back. We have a lot of stuff to play. I will return.

1577
06:10:48,119 --> 06:10:56,419
You will see me next week. You died to Bale. Well, I didn't die to Bale. I died to Bale's minions.

1578
06:10:57,139 --> 06:11:01,189
We didn't even get to see one move from Bale, but that's okay.

1579
06:11:01,990 --> 06:11:08,299
Further than I thought I was going to get. Merry GR. Thanks for the 250. Jerma, I had a

1580
06:11:08,299 --> 06:11:13,259
dream the other day where you were doing some Little Mermaid parody. Nothing really to the

1581
06:11:13,259 --> 06:11:19,419
dream, but I woke up crying in a weird fit of feeling the love from you and this whole

1582
06:11:19,419 --> 06:11:37,080
community. Thanks for all the joy. Feeling the love from you in this community and this community.

1583
06:11:42,259 --> 06:11:52,970
Why would I be doing a Little Mermaid parody? Do I have just like phantoms that just go around

1584
06:11:53,529 --> 06:11:59,529
at night and just cause mischief? Isn't this some folklore monster or creature or something that

1585
06:11:59,529 --> 06:12:11,180
does that? What is that called? It's called something. This is these little like phantom

1586
06:12:11,180 --> 06:12:23,130
goblins that mess with you and fuck with your dreams and stuff. What are they called? Your

1587
06:12:23,130 --> 06:12:29,209
sleep paralysis demon. Well, no, I don't think. Okay. If your sleep paralysis demon is a parody

1588
06:12:29,209 --> 06:12:36,020
of the Little Mermaid playing out in your room, that would be a very strange sleep paralysis

1589
06:12:36,020 --> 06:12:45,540
demon. It's just lying back on your bed, just not being able to move. It's just like

1590
06:12:54,220 --> 06:13:08,139
get me the fuck out of here. Peaceful Haley. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremy. Hope you have

1591
06:13:08,139 --> 06:13:12,259
fun with your friends this week. Thank you. I just want to say the other day during community

1592
06:13:12,259 --> 06:13:16,979
content night when you asked how I built your name in Minecraft, all he did was build up one

1593
06:13:16,979 --> 06:13:22,819
block at a time, made a bridge up top and just built the letters on that, then went back and

1594
06:13:22,819 --> 06:13:28,180
removed the bridge one block at a time. It took me a while and I wonder if there was an easy way

1595
06:13:28,180 --> 06:13:41,380
to have done that. That's pretty pog. That's 200 IQ, you know. Have a good night to you as well.

1596
06:13:41,380 --> 06:13:50,700
Thank you. That's coming back probably sometime in the middle of March, I would think. We'll see.

1597
06:13:50,700 --> 06:13:55,740
Still being worked on. Got something special for it. That's why. It's not just going to be what you

1598
06:13:55,740 --> 06:14:01,180
think it is. Whole of one zombie thanks to the 250. I've had two dreams that you were in.

1599
06:14:01,979 --> 06:14:07,799
The first, I was your security at some red carpet event. That's pretty cool. The other,

1600
06:14:07,799 --> 06:14:13,080
I met Italics Kim and yourself, had an awkward dinner. Italics was super friendly, but you were

1601
06:14:13,080 --> 06:14:25,240
not. Then you drove me to the airport. Why does everyone dream of you? I don't know. I don't know.

1602
06:14:29,540 --> 06:14:42,279
You're a dick. Why are you a dick in dreams? I don't know. That's not me. Quantum Jerma, yeah.

1603
06:14:42,840 --> 06:14:48,229
Nothing like that. Keith King Crimson thanks to the 250. What if that guy who kept spamming

1604
06:14:48,229 --> 06:14:52,869
Jerma just like backpack a few months ago could see the future? I was trying to talk about the

1605
06:14:52,869 --> 06:15:00,470
straps of your boomer harness. We, I haven't said that out loud in a long time. Was that actually

1606
06:15:00,470 --> 06:15:06,069
just somebody from this community just writing a sentence that made no sense or is that an actual

1607
06:15:06,069 --> 06:15:15,540
meme that somebody, it just was, I'm going to write a nonsense statement. It means nothing.

1608
06:15:15,540 --> 06:15:19,139
It's not a meme from anything. It's not a reference to anything. It's just somebody wrote that.

1609
06:15:20,180 --> 06:15:32,810
That was it. I'm here. It was just one guy. He did it for like three streams. Hey, look at that.

1610
06:15:32,810 --> 06:15:48,380
A wink. Could you believe it? People have been saving up. All right, we only have a few more

1611
06:15:48,380 --> 06:15:59,560
bits to do. He smiled at me. He smiled at me. A poop killer thanks to the 500 bits.

1612
06:16:00,279 --> 06:16:04,599
Freezy burns thanks to the 300 bits. Jerma gonna miss you for the next week. Always a pleasure

1613
06:16:04,599 --> 06:16:09,220
staying up late to watch your streams. Don't forget about me. Don't worry. I won't forget about

1614
06:16:09,220 --> 06:16:13,939
you guys. I hope you don't forget about me. Come back. It's going to be empty. It's going to be an

1615
06:16:13,939 --> 06:16:19,209
empty town here. I've been away for much longer than this. You guys are still here. So

1616
06:16:20,009 --> 06:16:28,630
we'll see you when I get back. X war two. Thanks for the 250. I forgot you. I forgot you had to

1617
06:16:28,630 --> 06:16:36,380
use at least 250 bits and that is a newish rule over the last probably six, seven months or so,

1618
06:16:36,380 --> 06:16:42,540
just about just about maybe a little bit longer than that. But still, it's still a fairly new

1619
06:16:42,540 --> 06:16:47,180
rule in the grand scheme of things. Just want to say that I'm sad I missed all the streams this week

1620
06:16:48,139 --> 06:16:53,740
but this new blood has been getting caught up on VODs. There's just too many old games you had

1621
06:16:53,740 --> 06:16:59,659
gone through almost caught up. Expect to see more of me in the future. This new blood's here to stay.

1622
06:17:00,299 --> 06:17:04,939
I've only been falling for two weeks. Just finished black and white. Hopefully you'll

1623
06:17:04,939 --> 06:17:11,020
play the sequel soon. Well, welcome. Welcome to the stream. Welcome to the channel.

1624
06:17:13,959 --> 06:17:23,909
If you want to really catch up totally, you've got seven and a half years of YouTube videos

1625
06:17:23,909 --> 06:17:30,630
and streams to watch. It'll take you, I mean it might take you maybe two or three straight months

1626
06:17:30,630 --> 06:17:35,830
every day, 24 hours straight to watch them all. Maybe like four months straight. You just got to

1627
06:17:35,830 --> 06:17:42,580
catch up. Skip season three. So I would skip season two. Season three was really good.

1628
06:17:43,619 --> 06:17:52,520
Start with the Shwee videos. This used to be a Maynay stream and that's an old one.

1629
06:17:53,659 --> 06:18:00,459
Now welcome. Thanks for joining. Thanks for following. Especially thanks for giving me money

1630
06:18:00,459 --> 06:18:08,520
because that's not necessary but people do all the fucking time. So thank you.

1631
06:18:09,400 --> 06:18:14,310
Jay Bum Bum. Jay Bum Bum 7723. You got to get it right.

1632
06:18:17,540 --> 06:18:20,900
Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma, you know when you're watching a horror movie and start

1633
06:18:20,900 --> 06:18:24,819
screaming at the screen because the protagonist is doing something dumb and you know exactly

1634
06:18:24,819 --> 06:18:29,700
what's going to happen. That's what watching the outer wild stream was like. Watching you try to

1635
06:18:29,700 --> 06:18:33,380
find the entrance to the vessel was like watching a fly in your house try to get out through the

1636
06:18:33,380 --> 06:18:39,299
window. All jokes aside, I love your streams and the outer wild streams was amazing. Keep up the

1637
06:18:39,299 --> 06:18:50,740
good work. Somebody wrote, that's called backseat gaming. Now that game was really fun. It was very

1638
06:18:50,740 --> 06:18:57,459
interesting too. It wasn't that bad. I, all right. I feel like I figured out a lot of the stuff in

1639
06:18:57,459 --> 06:19:03,880
that game. I, I was putting the, I took my time. I was trying to do stuff. I figured out the last

1640
06:19:03,880 --> 06:19:12,439
puzzle on my own. Right? I did okay. I didn't do fantastic. It did all right. Not the worst Tony

1641
06:19:12,439 --> 06:19:24,310
Hawk player that's ever by the way. I'm still on that. We're going to YouTube the end of the game.

1642
06:19:24,310 --> 06:19:29,110
Yeah, but we don't talk about that. That was, I was just, I was cranky. I didn't have my fucking

1643
06:19:29,110 --> 06:19:44,139
go-go applesauce. Sun joke got old. It's the new, it's the new bear trap thing from Darkwood. I can't

1644
06:19:44,139 --> 06:19:46,939
tell you it was fake because nobody would believe me anyways. It doesn't matter.

1645
06:19:48,220 --> 06:19:52,819
I can't like tell you that it was real because it was like, no, there's no way it was. Yeah,

1646
06:19:52,819 --> 06:20:01,689
whatever. And finally, silent serenity. Thanks for the 250. You should upload another update

1647
06:20:01,689 --> 06:20:06,650
video to the main channel just as a joke. No, that's just like, and that's just like,

1648
06:20:07,450 --> 06:20:21,099
it's like antagonizing somebody. I don't want to do that. Did you buy Super Frog 2? I don't even,

1649
06:20:21,099 --> 06:20:27,689
I didn't, no, I didn't. I'll have to get it. Somebody said, why, why does italics not want

1650
06:20:27,689 --> 06:20:31,770
to do co-op streams? No, no, that's not, that's not what I meant. I just said there's not a whole

1651
06:20:31,770 --> 06:20:38,330
lot of co-op games to play that we really want to do. There's really only like two.

1652
06:20:39,669 --> 06:20:44,380
Swat's one of them. We'll probably all just play it. I think it's like, you can have like up to

1653
06:20:44,380 --> 06:20:48,380
three or four players in one of those games, can't you? Try to get all the boys together.

1654
06:20:55,750 --> 06:21:03,509
Yeah, you can squat four, you can have like four players. The boys. Let's get the boys

1655
06:21:03,509 --> 06:21:14,340
to get, let's get the boys back. Hot Dog Chokeslam just gave 300 bits at the very end.

1656
06:21:16,220 --> 06:21:29,830
Uh, they don't say it, just Jerma Hart. Thank you Hot Dog Chokeslam. And that is it. I will see you

1657
06:21:29,830 --> 06:21:38,889
all in a week. I've got to get going. I have to meet up with friends. Have a wonderful rest

1658
06:21:38,889 --> 06:21:44,119
of your night. Have a wonderful week. See you guys soon. Much love to you. Take care of yourselves.

1659
06:21:46,299 --> 06:21:47,659
Good night.
