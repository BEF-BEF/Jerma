1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:35,299
I want you guys to tell me if you can hear the music that is about to start playing.

2
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:40,009
So let me know, because otherwise there will be no sound. So, ready? Let me know if you

3
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:53,909
can hear the medic music. Oh yeah. You hear that? Good to know, because that means I set

4
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:04,879
the audio cable thing up correctly. So that's good to know. Loud and clear, Berga Boy. Alright.

5
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,760
So tonight, first of all, happy Saturday. Hope you guys are having a fantastic Saturday.

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,840
Second of all, of course, Grandpa is tonight. There's a lot of things going on tonight.

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,780
There's a lot of things going on in the world of Jeremy. Did a video, doing a live stream.

8
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:28,000
Grandpa's is tonight on Machinima. A lot of crazy stuff. So I've been all over the place

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,540
today. Flomi, let him explain himself. Let him explain himself. Alright, Flomi, you have

10
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:57,730
ten words to explain yourself. Ten words. And ten words or less. Two plus two is four.

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:19,610
Alright, so let me just... Where's my phone? Oh, I always am losing my damn phone. It always

12
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:37,139
happens. Hold on. I think it's across the room. There it is. Hello, phone. Alright. Oh, if

13
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,219
you're watching this on YouTube, like eventually when I upload this tomorrow, if you're watching

14
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,379
this on YouTube, go ahead and you can skip like two or three minutes while I set this

15
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,509
up. I know I put an annotation there, but sometimes people go, whoa, when do you start?

16
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:57,550
So go ahead and skip a couple minutes if you're watching this on the YouTubes. Okay. Twitter.

17
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:05,379
Hello, Twitter. So yeah, Team Fortress 2 and Binding of Isaac. And you're probably wondering

18
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,699
why am I playing that crazy, ridiculous, disturbing game. Well, because there's DLC for it coming

19
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:16,280
out in like a couple days. So I want to get back into it because I love that game. So

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:37,919
let's see. Streaming TF2 and Binding of Isaac. Oh, come hang on ya. HTTP colon slash slash

21
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:51,689
www.twitch.tv. Don't ask me why I always do this on my phone. I just like don't feel

22
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,870
like opening up another tab. Like it's probably faster if I did it on my damn computer. It

23
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,099
is that. It's that. Alright. Ready to go here in a second. Just going to put a Steam message

24
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:17,040
out to the Steam community. Have to be, oh my, oh what, new name apparently. Massive

25
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,540
Bus Accident is my name on here. Well, that's one way to have your name be. Whatever. Massive

26
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:43,980
Bus Accident. Oh, weird. Streaming TF2. Oh, why do I think that's so funny? Oh, screaming

27
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:17,740

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:35,470
of Isaac. Streaming. Yeah, open mouth, faceless party. 15 minutes. Alright. Oh, God. Oh, no.

29
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh, no. I just like dumped a drink on my floor. Oh, God. Oh, you know what? It's staying there.

30
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:07,149
It's staying there. I'll deal with it later. God. What a pro. Okay. There's like a cup

31
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:15,870
of milk on my floor right now. That is not cool. Whatever. The show must go on. Let's

32
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:33,860
do it. That's that. And here's the tweet. I can't believe that. Milk doesn't body good.

33
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:48,509
Unless you dump it on your floor. Done. Geez Louise. Does that work? Let's find out. Nice

34
00:06:48,509 --> 00:07:09,110
like Avatar. Alright. We're good to go. We're good to go. Okay, now I'm going to make the

35
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:20,779
chat so I can see it. Good Lord. Well, that was not cool. Let's get a server with zero

36
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:26,129
people in it. And my TF2 server is coming along. I know I said last week it was going

37
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:34,579
to be done this week, but it's not. It's close though. I have to talk to the guys at gameservers.com.

38
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:47,050
We have to have a meeting. Some type of meeting. What's up dudes? If you're just joining us,

39
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,149
I just spilled a cup of milk on my floor and it's going to stay there until I'm done screaming.

40
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,709
Hope I don't like ruin anything. If it like seeps over near my computer, that's going

41
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:05,699
to be really bad. It might have to be like an emergency stop. Alright, let's go to...

42
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:20,889
No, no toot fort. No, Dustbowl. We played Dustbowl too much. How about... I'm a gravel

43
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:29,160
pit. I'm okay with gravel pit. Let's do gravel pit. This is the server. Ladies and gents,

44
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:39,620
head there. Gravel pit. Yeah, Dustbowl is a little overplayed, but I love it though.

45
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,809
I love Dustbowl. That's because I'm an old school TF2 player. I mean I've been playing

46
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:54,090
since 2007 and I remember that. There used to only be Dustbowl, two fort, turbine, gravel

47
00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:05,299
pit. There was only six maps when TF2 launched. Two fort, Dustbowl, gravel pit, turbine. What

48
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,759
were the other two maps? What the hell were the other two maps? Can somebody in the chat

49
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:22,070
throw that out there? Oh, well and granary, right? Those are the only six that came out

50
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:31,299
at release. Let's go blue. Let's go attacking tonight. I feel like being an attacker. No,

51
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:41,990
we're going to start with medic. I'm starting with the medic. Alright, let's get the audio

52
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:53,019
good here. Game audio good. Voice audio is it? Are we getting overpowered? You can never

53
00:09:53,019 --> 00:10:07,830
tell. Oh yeah, high five baby. Alright, let's push this point boys. If anyone wants to duel

54
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,220

55
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:32,299
stream but I will try my best. I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. Follow me doctor. We go.

56
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,059

58
00:10:52,330 --> 00:11:06,710
That wasn't my bad. I screwed that up. James A-hole. We're okay. That guy's going to try

59
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,200

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:46,299
quiet. You're very quiet. What? What? What? I knew I got him. Alright, let's push it.

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,259

67
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:31,799
him in the face. Yeah if you got a duel throw it my way dude. I will duel you. Just a positive

68
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:50,629
elutely. We're going to get A. Let's get A. Oh I have to duel you. I don't even know

69
00:12:51,029 --> 00:13:00,809

least predominantly minecraft? See I have no idea. This is me just I have absolutely

96
00:17:47,819 --> 00:18:00,539
shoot a bunch over there. Oh my god. Never mind. I do know Star as well. I'm not as

97
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:10,390
close with Star as I am with Shibby but I know Star. We talk. Speaking of Star. We may

98
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:21,769
actually be doing videos together sometime soon. Sometime very very soon. He's a cool

99
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:29,930
guy though. Stimmy D? Yes. I know Stimmy D. Stimmy D is a bro. Pretty much if you can

100
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,410
name me like a Team Fortress 2 channel I probably know them. Like I probably like know who they

101
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:43,569
are and I've probably spoken to them at least once or twice. Stay alive derp. Do you know

102
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:56,599
German985? No. Who's that? He sounds like a real loser. Get rid of this guy. Get rid

103
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:28,269
of this guy. That's a spy. What? Alright so my brain just exploded. I walked towards that

104
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,910
engineer the real one and then I turned around and I thought it was him again and I thought

105
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:52,559
it was real so I got fell. That was a good spy. Why are we screaming? But to answer the

106
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,660
question yes I know most of the Team Fortress 2 channels. I don't know all of them. I mean

107
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,960
there are probably a few that I've never really had a conversation with or something but for

108
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:17,809
the most part I've had a conversation with all of them. Alright that's a spy. No it's

109
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:28,269
just a dump machine burger boy. No stay alive dude. I got you. Oh the medic chain. Oh my

110
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:36,210
word. I'm getting a little bit of trouble here. I shouldn't be walking out that far.

111
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh just give me one more. I use it? Yes. Oh everyone died. I gotta use it. Oh crit rockets

114
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:16,029

116
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:36,079
Optimus Prime. I'm cool. Not right this second. Maybe after when it's all said and done. But

117
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:43,019
for now I want to focus on the Zestreem. Just give me a strafe thank you. Yeah we'll do

118
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:56,329

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:40,039

123
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:56,980
If I get a strange Huntsman I know I'm gonna keep it. That's crazy. What's up Millennium

127
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,390
Yeah I love all the scatter guns. Except for the Force of Nature it's not my forte. I'm

128
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:47,869
not a big fan of it. Let's see if we can't crit some people. Oh my god. That was a death

129
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:52,130
wish. I just wanted to see how many hit markers would just pop up. I don't even think I have...

130
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,039
I don't have... I gave away my backpack. That's the only option I have right now. Where's my...

131
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,779
What happened to my Mad Bill? Oh right. I probably gave that away. Yeah I gave that away as well.

132
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:19,890
Let's close this out boys and girls. Potentially. I want to get that good couple kills with this

133
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:32,529

134
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:42,740

135
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:53,859
I didn't even see him. Run away! Oh my god. See getting stuck just like saved my life right there.

136
00:24:53,859 --> 00:25:06,460
I would have got shot right in the back. I would have got shot right in my behind. Crap.

137
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:24,660
I'm bumping into somebody. Bumping into somebody. Yep there he is. Help me! Wow! The dead ringer.

138
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:43,579
Anybody? Anybody? Oh nine damage. Thank god I did nine damage. Oh man this is bad news. Bad news

139
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:54,829
right here. What am I thinking? Oh god. I tied it up at the very end. Oh my god. Right at the very end

140
00:25:54,829 --> 00:26:01,940
I tied it. Holy crap. Alright good game guys. We are going to change servers now. So thanks guys

141
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:15,150
jumping in this one. Don't want anyone. This... I gotta clean this milk up. I gotta clean this mad milk up.

142
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:31,750
Viaduct? No that's... I don't know where that is. Five gorge. Could be cool. What else we got?

143
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:41,700
Granary? I might be feeling granary right now. I think I'm feeling granary guys. Sawmill or granary?

144
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:56,940
Alright. Sawmill or granary? Hmm. Granary it is. We're doing granary. In the reddit server apparently.

145
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:13,259
Copy that. Here you go. There's the new server. Granary is one of those maps that you never feel

146
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:18,380
like playing on it but once you're actually playing on it you have a good time. I don't know why. Every

147
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,019
single time I play granary it's like oh do I want to play granary? I don't think so. But then when I

148
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:37,420
actually get on it it's like oh this is fun. Oh it just changed to well. Well that's cool. I feel the

149
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:50,569
same way about well though to be honest. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Here we

150
00:27:50,569 --> 00:28:01,980
go. I'll go red because I was on blue last time. Maybe not. And maybe so. Nope. Let me join red.

151
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:12,410
This time we're gonna play demo. Default demo man. Okay. No no no no no no no no. Strange lock

152
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:31,279
and load. Almost forgot. I almost forgot. Mission begins in one second. One. Go! No millennium man.

153
00:28:31,279 --> 00:29:02,980
Get a better internet. Let's see. Can I kill somebody? Oh man. Millennium man. Will I be

154
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:10,970
selling admin on my server? No. I plan on just having people be able to play and I'm sure that

155
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,589
if you play there for long enough and you're a good supporter of the server I would just give it to

156
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:26,809
you. You wouldn't have to pay for it. Save your money. That was a bad jump. And now I'm gonna die

157
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:48,059
like instantly. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. He's behind us.

158
00:29:48,059 --> 00:30:06,859
He's dead now. I thought he was gonna walk out the door. It's alright. Let me out of here. Oh no. Oh

159
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:16,019
no. What's going on? No. I'm gonna drown. Oh my god. I really thought I was gonna drown right there

160
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:53,259
guys. I'll die. Watch out behind us. Behind us. Yikes. I got wrecked right when I got over here.

161
00:30:53,259 --> 00:31:04,359
Damn it. Oh my god. I didn't expect this. Oh I didn't. I didn't even look. I should have been

162
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:17,839
looking. I'm an idiot. It's my bad. Top isn't it? Nice job guys. Nice job. Gentlemen and ladies.

163
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:28,519
Good job. Gentle ladies and gentlemen. Oh who's that? Who is that? Who am I doing a repression

164
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:49,180
up? Oh jump. Mission begins in 30 seconds. We're going across the top. Oh my god. Look who it is

165
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:54,700
ladies and gentlemen. Burger boy with like a chocolate melted in his mouth. Oh what am I

166
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,650
doing? I shouldn't have came this way. Why is that up here? Why is that up here? Who got up here?

167
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:19,930
What? How? That must have been from the last round. Oh I'm never gonna hit him. Oh he just like jumped

168
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:40,839
into that. Where's my spray? I want a spray. Come on walk all over this. Come on. Come on. Oh let me get him.

169
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:54,039
Well at least we got it. It's a pallet. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Careful for spies.

170
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:04,890
That might be a spy. I think it was. Yes it was. Cartoons. Cartoons. Cartoons. Be careful. We're

171
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:34,950
entering the enemy base. Oh man. We might be like a team scramble. Oh get out of town. Oh damn it.

172
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,210
Oh I thought I thought if I would just be in tryhard mode right there I could just be quietly

173
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:59,480
killing my battle. Oh the teams I guess aren't that bad. We could probably use a scramble. Maybe

174
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:17,849
not. We'll find out. Going this way. Going this way. There's a dude right here. Oh boy. Heads up.

175
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:35,050
Heavy. Oh I thought I was gonna hit him. It's all about that little area. A little corridor. Oh I

176
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:44,219
thought he didn't get hit by that. What's up with that? How can we? Oh we're defending this point.

177
00:34:44,219 --> 00:35:01,320
Oh my god. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Help me. Somebody help me. Oh suicide. I'm gonna die.

178
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:11,769
The heavy baby. Uh actually I talked to DJ like last night about it and he's working on more stuff.

179
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:15,769
He's a hard worker man. He's got a lot of cool ideas. He's working on a lot of stuff.

180
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:33,510
It's coming. It's coming. Well you just scared me. Thought you were an enemy. Oh no. Why did I do

181
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:42,360
that? I got behind everybody and no one knew I was there. What is wrong with me? Oh what does

182
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:50,579
the matter with me? If I had just like not been a freak show I probably would have had a couple

183
00:35:50,579 --> 00:36:17,820
of kills right there. Whoa. Oh come on. Come on. All right we're going pyro. Pyro with the flare gun

184
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,539
and I don't. I do have an agree switch still. I have an agree switch. You gotta use the

185
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:33,429
console to enter the server. Enter the server IP. I think it's the tilde key. You have to enable it.

186
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:44,469
Hold on a second. I've got to appear offline. Just so those notifications stop popping up

187
00:36:44,469 --> 00:37:04,380
because nobody wants to see the notifications. They want to see Team Fortress 2. Oh damn it.

188
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,969
So much stuff going on. No no don't die. I'm trying to save the heavy. What? Who got hit by the bus?

189
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:21,130
Somebody got hit by the bus I think. Yeah this is the tilde key if you want to know how to enable

190
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:28,869
it. Go to options. Go to advanced and then enable developer console. I want that checked and then

191
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:34,469
once that is checked by default it is the tilde key. The thing under escape and it looks like this.

192
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:46,409
Then you type in connect space then the IP and then enter and that's it. And that's all she wrote.

193
00:37:46,409 --> 00:38:02,900
Massive bus accident. Got hit by a train. Oh my god. Oh no. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

194
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:13,690
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm gonna spell it out. D-A-M-N-I-T-E.

195
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:20,940
I have never played TF2Ware. I've heard it is hysterical though and I am absolutely

196
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,559
willing to try it. They're pushing us back. They have pushed us all the way back.

197
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:38,440
Oh good. I'm hanging out here. TF2Ware is like a WarioWare mod for Team Fortress where you

198
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,500
get like five seconds to do like a little mini game. It's very funny. I've seen videos on it.

199
00:38:43,500 --> 00:39:01,829
It looks really entertaining. Jump with them. Oh damn it. Oh god it's chaos. Shoot at me.

200
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:15,699
Somebody shoot at me with something. No that was just chaos. Gotta move that gear up.

201
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:21,050
Yeah actually I own Garry's Mod. I'm not very good at it though. I know a lot of people in

202
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,920
Garry's Mod can make ridiculous things. I'm not one of those people. Like oh I made this

203
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,000
boat that's actually a car. That's actually a house and it moves and these mouths are animated.

204
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:50,630
I can't do anything like that. I wish I could. Oh my god. Oh my god. Retreat. Wow. No. No. No.

205
00:39:52,489 --> 00:40:00,090
There's nothing I can do. Damn it. New server guys. We'll do one more new server and then

206
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:07,239
we're going to hop over to Binding of Isaac probably. The last empty server. Where are we

207
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:16,679
going to find you? Auxiliary Operation. What the hell is that? One of the 32. No actually

208
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:24,570
this one's one of the 28. Badwater. We can end it on Badwater. There you go. Join that server

209
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:38,340
right now ladies and gentlemen. That's the new IP. I'll post it again and there it is again.

210
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:51,750
Oh man. I'll go defense again. Gonna go big sentry engineer. Oh man this is depressing.

211
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:59,860
Where's all my stuff? This is all I have. Where's all my like hats?

212
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:09,269
At least I have this. I can look like I can put this on. Wait I can wear this?

213
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,590
Oh cool. I didn't know I could wear that. That's awesome. Hell yeah I'll wear that.

214
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:39,769
I'll wear my ring. Big sentry engineer. Get that built. Get it to uh you know what? Just do an

215
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:58,699
entrance. I'm good. I'd rather have like the return to glory. But thank you though Prime.

216
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:11,099
Appreciate that. Where's it going? Let's go right here. This is a pretty safe place. Now you know

217
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:22,940
what? This is going over here. That's going over here. We're going. We're going. Oh yeah we're on

218
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,300
fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Hey knuckle heads I'm talking to you. Bonk. Oh what?

219
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:50,650
Okay that just scared the crap out of me. That just scared me. Like I really got scared by that.

220
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:59,829
Like it was like oh man I'm sorry you guys. If you were in that server and you just got in and

221
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:14,309
you I'm I really am sorry. Okay well let's this one is no no I don't want to 12 people in it already.

222
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:29,530
Damn that was that was dumb. All right dust bowl. No this one's bad. This is this bots here.

223
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:37,739
So if we start to join this it'll get rid of the bots right? That's usually what happens. I'm pretty

224
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:46,900
sure that's what happens. So let's try this one. Bad water basin. Hopefully this one doesn't just

225
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:58,460
turn off. Insta turn off. I hope you're enjoying your time because it's about to insta turn off.

226
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,889
All right I'll stick with this. I'll stick with this. Going over here though. Oh you're already

227
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:14,619
over there. All right you got that coming. I'm cool. I'll stick with right there. Why is burger

228
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:31,659
boy so fat? Hey that's not nice. That's not a nice thing to say about burger boy. This is a bad spot

229
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:37,980
for that. I don't know why I put that there. I need to move that eventually. Somebody right there

230
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:45,429
can just shoot at it. You know what? I might move my... I'm gonna move it. I'm going up here.

231
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:54,280
I'm gonna go over here. Looks like they're not capping. Come on come on come on come on.

232
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh damn it. Damn it. Damn it. He doesn't have the staffer. He doesn't have the staffer. Somebody

233
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:07,619
take care of that. You know what? I'm gonna go gunslinger. I have a feeling that's gonna happen

234
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:22,059
a thousand more times. I'm gonna give my dispenser to this guy. I'm gonna put it over here in case

235
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:27,110
somebody comes and uber charges and kills that. He'll have this backup one in case he needs it.

236
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:43,500
There you go sir. Go get some more. I'll be out. They'll be okay. I'm gonna leave. Whoops.

237
00:45:43,500 --> 00:46:10,250
Didn't mean to click. Ah hell. Run away. Too many sentries in the same spot. That's a double

238
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:23,190
mini sentry a lot. Damn it. I got too many spies. Too many spas. Oh engineer. I'm not gonna play

239
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:31,659
with you. I'll go soldier. Soldier with the strange liberty launcher and the italian's backup. Why not?

240
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:40,599
Might as well. And the strange has to touch. Do I want a vintage huntsman? I'm good. I'll be okay.

241
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:50,019
Thank you though. I'd rather like I said before rather you guys keep your stuff as you could use

242
00:46:50,019 --> 00:47:03,239
it too. Oh my god. It's fantastic. I'm dead instantly. I didn't even see them. Oh they're

243
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:16,949
gonna win. Well no. No no. I want the. If I would. I mean any weapon of my choice if I would have

244
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:21,349
wanted. Strange huntsman everyone was just talking about. My god it's worth like 50 million dollars

245
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:33,849
or something. Worth 500 thousand million trillion dollars. Let's get on a streak here. What do you

246
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:44,340
say Jerma? Let's get on a streak. Reserved shooter would have been like a better option.

247
00:47:45,300 --> 00:48:05,460
Oh pull here. Be careful. Oh boy he's in trouble. Watch out man. He's trying to pull us. Oh this is

248
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:17,030
a losing fight. This is a losing fight. Gotta get away. Oh come on. Look at his health. Look at his

249
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:28,150
health. Should you use your three refine to craft a hat or should you trade it? Um it depends what

250
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:34,900
hat you want because if you go into a trading server you can for a lot of a lot of the time

251
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,960
you can get one hat for one refine. Like one of those craftable hats. It really depends if you want

252
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,989
just a hat. Because you could potentially get like three hats with three refine. Or if you want to

253
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:54,329
like just make a random one and potentially get one of the new ones. Got a new email apparently.

254
00:48:54,329 --> 00:49:30,219
Check that after I die. Well he's going up here. You're not a spy. Oh my god there's a sentry. Oh

255
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:37,269
they're gonna get it. They're gonna get it. Gotta get rid of that sentry. Even if I die damn it damn

256
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:43,480
it damn it. Oh he's standing right there. The difference between dirty and clean items I really

257
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:52,460
don't know. I'm not a real big trader so I'm not really sure all will then go. I think clean is

258
00:49:52,460 --> 00:50:09,000
when it doesn't say who crafted it. Isn't that what it means? Oh uncraftable okay. I think we're

259
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:49,110
good. I think we got it. Oh run. I don't have my equalizer for spy too. I didn't even see what

260
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:52,469
I'm sorry. I'm looking back and forth at the chat in the game. What hat are you talking about?

261
00:50:52,469 --> 00:51:01,530
Let's see do you want the hat Jerma? Just read. I'm like wait what hat? I would I would like it if

262
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:07,079
I you guys don't have to give me anything. I got I got plenty of stuff. I got plenty of options

263
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,400
where I can get things. You guys hold on to your items. They're your hard earned items. You guys

264
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:30,019
deserve them not me. There's a lot of people right there. Oh crit. Oh. Outside 100 I have a setup

265
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:36,489
video. If you go to my YouTube channel and you type in 4,000 subs. I did like a 4,000 subscriber

266
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:42,469
thing a long long time ago and it's a setup video and it's got the same I got the same computer so

267
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:48,010
I'm probably gonna get a new computer at some point in the near future. I would assume probably

268
00:51:48,010 --> 00:52:01,670
in the next couple months I will get a new computer. Well it's over. You failed. You failed.

269
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:12,619
All right so I think I'm going to transition over to Binding of Isaac for like one life or

270
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:35,800
two lives or something like that. We'll see what I do. Binding of Isaac is a really weird really

271
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:43,030
disturbing kind of uh it's it's made in flash I think but it's a steam game you can get it's

272
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:48,300
five bucks it's very very disturbing and very screwed up so I will put that disclaimer out

273
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:57,739
there before uh I stream it but yeah thank you guys if you were just here for the tf2 then

274
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:02,840
thank you so much for coming and watching you guys rock and roll and I'll catch you guys probably

275
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:16,760
next time and oh I'm being hit in the face by a frying pan okay all right let's do some Binding

276
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:31,449
of Isaac no hold on to your hats hold on to your hats hold on to your seats now let me see if I can

277
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:53,639

278
00:53:54,570 --> 00:54:07,980
Binding of Isaac update yeah I gotta change my background actually you know what let's change

00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:34,010
all right so let's do personalize uh desktop backgrounds desktop background all right so do

281
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:41,750
I want like the space needle oh god am I might be like breaking the stream maybe not let's see

282
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:54,820
okay I'm not I think I like the space needle put up a photo of grandpa what about the ice one

283
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:05,139
oh sleek oh what about this one oh man oh this is that's that this is the one this is the one

284
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:14,679
I'm keeping look at this thing that thing is beautiful save changes look at this gorgeous

285
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:28,760
gorgeous screen it's like a painting all right it's okay so let's play Binding of Isaac so uh

286
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:36,119
disclaimer Binding of Isaac is an incredibly messed up disturbing crazy insane game uh so viewer

287
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:43,780
discretion is advised I'm going to say that before playing because obviously this game is uh ridiculous

288
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:49,300
hopefully uh the stream doesn't die I don't think it will

289
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:26,599
audio is gonna have to come down okay change this screen's gonna go black black screen screen

290
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:48,380
region this stretch it out all righty Binding of Isaac so I'm pretty good at this game I've

291
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:56,099
become pretty good at this game I love this game it is so much fun it's just so addicting go with

292
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:10,630
the cane got the eye patch all right let's do it the reason why I'm playing this again is because

293
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:18,179
the DLC is coming out in the next couple of days I think the Binding of Isaac DLC should be out soon

294
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:38,820
in the meantime I'm gonna run around like a psycho so if you like games that are they call these

295
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:48,500
roguelikes don't they have roguelike dungeon crawlers the real blizzard 10121 how do you

296
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:55,500
become a mod on the stream um usually the mods are people are people that I that I'm like friends

297
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,550
with that I talk to all the time and stuff like that but yeah I mean if you if you've been coming

298
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:06,519
for that long and you know I'll probably set up some type of way to get a mod uh a way for you to

299
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:11,239
get mod or wait for people to get mod if they want it but it's hard to give mods to people

300
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,460
because there's just so many people that that would want it so it's very very difficult to say

301
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:21,400
oh yeah you can be a mod sure oh triple shot this is gonna be a good game this is gonna be a good

302
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:28,280
game it's but it's it's hard to give out mod specifically because it's just so many people

303
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,300
want it so if I were to give it to one person and you know somebody else would be like well I want

304
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:40,619
mod too and it's like uh yeah it's a very tough decision to make so but eventually I will probably

305
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:55,260
do I will probably do a some type of way to get it I don't know how though triple shot is incredible

306
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,480
get triple shot extra damage more tears you're talking about absolute chaos let me get that

307
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:14,010
bomb and open up a secret room for crying out loud spread gun oh no it was the troll bomb fly

308
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:20,019
contest mod giveaway you know what I pro you know what we're that's a will do I'll do some type of

309
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:30,699
I don't know I don't know it's hard I'll tell you one thing for those of you that are hanging out

310
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:37,159
here I'm going to do I'm gonna make a video I'm gonna do a video on this in the next couple of

311
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:46,090
days next week's stream it's going to be very very interesting because I'm gonna do a game show

312
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:52,969
I'm gonna I'm gonna uh let me try and explain this I'm gonna buy like another like 30 or 40

313
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:59,590
keys and get a bunch of crates and what we're gonna do is we're gonna do like a trivia night

314
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:07,960
where I have the screen open it's on team fortress 2 so the screens open on team fortress 2 like 40

315
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,860
crates with 40 keys and I'm gonna ask trivia questions like basic like gaming trivia questions

316
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:18,980
it's not gonna be all totally team fortress though so it might be some other general gaming

317
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:23,400
questions and if you get it right if you're the first person to get it in the chat then you get to

318
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,679
pick which crate you want to unlock and I just thought I thought about that the other day I was

319
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:35,139
like you know that would be actually really cool it'd be fun so that's the plan for next and I'm

320
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:39,460
gonna make a video on this if you're watching this on YouTube and you're like oh wait wait wait what

321
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:50,699
I want more details there's gonna be a video made about that very very soon yes you will get what's

322
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:55,780
inside if you open if you get the trivia question correct you can open up whatever's in whatever

323
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,150
crate you want you get whatever's in there it doesn't matter if it's a five million dollar

324
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:09,639
unusual or paint you're gonna get it oh no no no no get out of my way I don't want to tie this

325
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:26,780
early triple shot yeah if you want if you guys have crates I mean I know I did a crate people

326
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:32,840
donated a lot to the last one but if you have crates if you have you know I've series 20 and

327
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:46,809
above anything lower than series 20 I don't think I would want but it's just a way to involve

328
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:51,210
everybody because I think that'd just be fun like a trivia night you know what I mean like all right

329
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:57,860
in what level of like Legend of Zelda do you like just anything like that do you find the

330
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:02,860
Master Sword or something just general basic trivia questions a lot of people would get involved

331
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:11,210
it'd be really fun and hopefully somebody gets something cool sloth what you got nothing on me

332
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:22,469
you got nothing on me my triple shot baby there would be a lot of Team Fortress questions though

333
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:30,940
like oh in what crate can you get a strange Jirani oh I'm gonna die I'm like too busy talking about

334
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,300
what I'm doing though my next stream I'm like not even paying attention to this one

335
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:42,699
I have to use it oh what am I doing I didn't have to use that I could have used it in a

336
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:47,480
whatever whatever that's me being a really really dumb stupid person but you know what

337
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:55,750
at least I can see everything get room see the rooms right there what I need is I need

338
01:02:55,750 --> 01:03:21,780
damage up I know I have a stealth I know I know I know so is the music too loud right now I feel

339
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:37,639
like it is or am I just freaking out oh come on hit him okay because you know I have headphones

340
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:47,219
on so it's kind of tough me to decipher how loud something is or not and open up that secret room

341
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:59,269
baby three dollars or three pennies not dollars that's not a total waste of a secret room how do

342
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:05,670
you get the crates to me I'll probably set up some type of way everybody doesn't have to give them

343
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:21,670
though because obviously I only need like 30 or 40 of them I want to give you stuff should you get

344
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:30,139
this game I'm going to 100% absolutely 100 million percent say yes yes yes a million times this is an

345
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:37,719
incredibly fun incredibly addictive game it's just like a like 17 and up like this is this game is

346
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:44,199
not designed for like younger people to play only because of the incredibly like blasphemous

347
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:49,880
and ridiculous imagery that is associated with it but if you don't care about that then this game

348
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,019
is one of the most fun addictive probably one of the best games I've ever played that's under

349
01:04:55,019 --> 01:05:07,619
ten dollars this game's only five bucks this game is five dollars on steam yikes that's insane

350
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:14,199
this was actually supposed to be ported to the 3ds but Nintendo said uh uh uh that's not happening

351
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:25,139
I don't want the kamikaze thing do I even have enough money for anything I don't think so it's

352
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:30,099
not even worth opening this door not even worth opening the door I don't even have enough money to

353
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:44,119
get anything in there oh come on hit him I got the triple shot why am I missing so much yeah

354
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:54,309
Nintendo said because of religious and blasphemous the game is just really very very dark so it is

355
01:05:54,309 --> 01:06:01,320
only on the only place you can get it I don't think it's on xbox live oh look a sun card might

356
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:16,119
as well like waste it this boss's butt give an eye I'm like tempted to just use the sun card

357
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:21,690
and not have to even fight this guy but you know what I'm not gonna do it we will do this the right

358
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:41,099
way I'm trying to get rid of the baby first I don't think I can though I need more tears

359
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:55,719
not shooting fast enough something from the future I unlocked some now in the basement speed up I

360
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:04,420
would use the sun card but honestly it's just it's a uh it's a oh crap moment like I'm gonna die I'm

361
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:14,579
gonna die use it I'll bank I will take whatever is in there take that key thank you very much

362
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:24,489
how do you play this game it's just with the keyboard and you just go from room to room

363
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:30,070
clearing out all the monsters just like legend of Zelda or star tropics or other games that are

364
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,679
around the same design philosophy once you kill every single thing in the room you see in the

365
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:39,960
top left of the map and see what rooms are open that you can go to fight the boss you kill the

366
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:48,039
boss you go on to the next level and if you die it's over cannot continue there is no lives there's

367
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:54,409
no continuing you just die I have to start all over again this is gonna be a room where I might

368
01:07:54,409 --> 01:08:06,340
have to be just take this nice and slow I'll be okay I might not need to use the sun card there

369
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:22,869
we go yeah you big fat red bastard oh question is I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it the coin and

370
