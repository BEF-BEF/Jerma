1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:14,869
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's me Demon Lord Xaraxos here. You're probably wondering where's

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,989
Jerma? What happened to him? How come he's not doing this video? Well, it's because I have taken

3
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:27,269
over his soul, and I will only release it after playing around a Five Nights at Freddy's. Because

4
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,549
everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's, and who better than me, the Lord of all Hells and

5
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:41,270
demons and hatred? I'm not scared of anything. What could I possibly be afraid of in this little

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,149
shit game? I don't know. We'll find out very shortly. Let's go ahead and play a new game.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:02,469
This guy sounds kind of like an asshole. I'm gonna ignore him. Let's go camera 4B. That's what we're on.

8
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:18,790
Camera 5. Okay, 12 a.m. There's a bird. I don't like birds. Okay, camera 1A. Camera 7.

9
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:34,870
I can close the door. What the fuck was that? Okay, well that was a little weird. That was like a bird

10
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,230
in my face. I wasn't scared. I was not scared of that. I was just startled that it had jumped up

11
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,230
at me and scared me, so obviously that'll scare you. I don't think that I was scared, though,

12
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,709
because you were scared. I wasn't the one that was scared. It was you, actually.

13
00:01:50,709 --> 00:02:00,379
And you look like there's a blinking light over there now. Freddy. Oh, Freddy. Where are you,

14
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:09,259
Freddy? You can't hide from demon lord Xaraxos. I will boil you. I will eat your flesh and tear

15
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:17,180
off the bones and use them as toothpicks in my stew. If you think I'm going to be scared of your...

16
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,340
One of them is missing. Okay, one of them is missing. Now, there was a rhinoceros that was

17
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,180
here before, and he just ain't here. This bear might have moved. I might have seen him somewhere.

18
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,300
I don't know. Pirate Cove is out of order. Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody

19
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,379
potentially trying to kill me, but I will kill them first. That's what you need to remember

20
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:48,439
from this whole thing. I will kill them first before they try to kill me. There is a guy standing

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:55,900
there. There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now, and I don't really know what

22
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:05,129
to do. Should I... He's still there. Okay. I hear music. No, no, the night's almost over. I only have

23
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,250
3% power, so that means the cameras are all going to turn off, and we're going to all go to sleep,

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:20,340
and it's going to be a nice, fun day at Freddy's Pizza Place Pizzeria, right? What the hell's that?

25
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,669
What the hell's going on? What the hell's going on? It's time to open the store. The pizzas are

26
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:41,259
opening. Why would you work here? Who would work at an establishment where you could actually get

27
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:47,400
killed by the people, the participants in the suits? I don't know why you would ever do such a

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,849
thing. You come work for me. At least there's benefits down in hell. You know, you get a good

29
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:00,169
dental plan. No, no, it's pretty good. You know, we're going to continue. I'm going to get... I

30
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:07,030
don't even know what the goal here is. I do not see him anywhere. Where is he? He's in the kitchen.

31
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,580
He's in the kitchen. The son of a bitch is in the kitchen. That means... Is he coming out here?

32
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,209
Yeah, he's in the kitchen. No, he's in this one. Okay, now he's right here. He's going to be right

33
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:28,470
here. No, he's not right here. Where is he? Oh, he's right... Okay, he's right here. He's literally

34
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,579
staring at me. It's 4 a.m. Don't let them come in. Do not let them come in. Is the door locked?

35
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:43,620
Both the doors are closed. You stay where you are. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

36
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:55,610
hey. None of that. We're not gonna have any of that. Oh, boy. This is closed. We're at 4 a.m. now.

37
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,699
Just got to get through the night. No, no, I got through the night. I did it. I was staring... I got

38
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:08,490
through the night. This is... Come on, we won. I won the game. Did I not win the game? Are you telling

39
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:17,220
me I didn't win the game? I was staring at him. What the hell? Oh, boo, here he comes. He's gonna

40
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:33,259
come. Oh, oh, boy. Don't get scared. Oh, you know what? I'm just... I'm just gonna go play Super

41
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:41,480
Mario Brothers because that game... I don't want to play this anymore. Jerma, Jerma, your soul is now

42
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:50,019
free. I'm releasing you. Why? Whoa, where... What happened? Well, just calm down, calm down.

43
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:54,819
Everything's okay. Everything's all right. I have it under control. I stole your soul so I can come

44
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,779
to earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's. What?
