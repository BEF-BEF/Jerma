00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:19,120
Father? Father? When can I go and play with the puppies, daddy? I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm such a bad boy, such a bad bad boy. I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna kill you.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,000
What? What?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Please let that be in the video.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,530
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong with this guy?

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:44,219
This guy was just trying to get me, and yell at me and stuff, and now he's just marveling at the sink.

6
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,890
So we're gonna try this. Hello?

7
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,130
That's it. I'm taking you to the authorities.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,939
Yes, please. Take me to the authorities.

9
00:00:54,939 --> 00:01:00,939
You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times, this guy would look down and be like, I shouldn't walk on the green shit.

10
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,939
No. Of course not.

11
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,420
What the hell?

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:22,609
I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. Hello, nurse. Hey, what's going on, guy? I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna take over your fucking mind. I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna go walk into a...

13
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:32,269
I'm scared.

14
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,819
What am I seeing?

15
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:52,099
Dude, I'm like a supernatural psycho dragging her on a bookshelf. Like, what do you mean, what am I seeing?

16
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,040
What the fuck is...

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Pick up those shaggy butts. Pick up those shaggy butts.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,819
Oh, she actually did.

19
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,819
She just took them. What? You stole those cigarettes?

20
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,340
I clearly threw those on the ground.

21
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,340
So now, I'm gonna fucking can ya.

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,340
You wanna get canned?

23
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
You ever been to Kansas? I'm gonna fucking can ya.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,770
This lady keeps ducking.

25
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,349
What are you eating? Invisible food?

26
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,349
I love invisible food. What about the guy on the left? What's he doing here? Just wearing that nice shirt.

27
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,349
Fucking naked guy. Just walking through.

28
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:43,110
This guy's not gonna have... He's gonna have a lot of trouble.

29
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,090
What the fuck?

30
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,900
You dropped it.

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,900
You didn't even do anything. You dropped it, dude.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,699
This... Without context, this is really strange.

33
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,860
What's this guy's story? I wanna know his full story.

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,430
Yeah, your arm's gonna be fine. Don't worry.

35
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,430
I mean, we're in a hospital right now. You're probably here for surgery or something.

36
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,430
Let me get you to your emergency room, surgery room.

37
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,430
Geez.

38
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,669
So on the right here, as you can see, I'm gonna give you a little quick tour before we go to your room.

39
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,669
That's gonna be the operating room, but I wanna introduce you to one of my favorite doctors.

40
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,669
Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman.

41
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,669
Dean Dingleman, here's the patient you'll be operating on.

42
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,669
His name is Kryden, Kaden, whatever his name is.

43
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,909
I just wanted to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery.

44
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,909
Just take you up a floor or two. That's all we gotta do here. Just don't mind me.

45
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,909
I mean, this thing's always broken.

46
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,909
Gotta throw a can of dog food at it to make sure we can get it open.

47
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,909
But yeah, I mean, can you believe that weather?

48
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,909
I mean, we had like a foot of snow today. I mean, can't you believe...

49
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,199
No.

50
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,719
You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?

51
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,719
Let me push a guy out a fucking elevator.

52
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,280
Fucking high C ectocoola. Let's see how you deal with this one.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
All right, sir, so go ahead and... I knew it.

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
They always slip. It doesn't matter if they're sitting, if they're on a fucking workout bench.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
It doesn't matter. It does not matter.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:29,069
I didn't even... I didn't do that.

57
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,569
Everybody just saw that I came back from...

58
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,569
I loaded into the game, and this happened.

59
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:37,569
I don't know what happened here. I had nothing to do with this.

60
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,569
Absolutely nothing to do with it.

61
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:47,759
Who's gonna get the sandwich first?

62
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,069
Everybody wanted the sandwich.

63
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,069
What?

64
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,269
I didn't poison that sandwich.

65
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,269
I did not poison that sandwich.

66
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,269
That guy just died.

67
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,269
Because he ate a dirty sandwich.

68
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:16,709
Just a second here.

69
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,949
So you two, that's normal.

70
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,949
You should be doing that.

71
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,949
There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot at the same time.

72
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:30,529
I mean, why...

73
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,350
What are you doing?

74
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,350
Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called...

75
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,350
What would happen if this would happen?

76
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,350
So today, in this new episode of...

77
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,350
What would happen if this was gonna happen?

78
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,350
We have a thing of donuts here.

79
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,350
And we've got these pills. We're gonna combine them.

80
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,350
And we're gonna see, you know...

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,350
What would happen if this was gonna happen?

82
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,350
See, the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him.

83
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,350
He's gonna pick up those donuts.

84
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,350
Oh man, I mean, what's gonna happen here?

85
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,350
He's gonna eat these donuts. He loves donuts.

86
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,350
With a giant pill box on them.

87
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,350
So, next episode on...

88
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,980
What would happen if this was gonna happen?
