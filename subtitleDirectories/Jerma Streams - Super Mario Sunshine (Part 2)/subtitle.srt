1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:12,699
Hello there. How you doing? Good morning to you. Oh, good morning. Good, um, good afternoon.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,600
Whatever time it is where you are. How are you? Hope you're doing a fantastic day.

3
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:24,870
It's midnight. Good morning. Yeah, I don't know why I said good morning.

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:38,090
Good morning. Oh yeah, but it's like, it's like time zones exist. It's morning somewhere in the world.

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,329
Always. It doesn't matter. It could be, it could be 10 o'clock at night

6
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:54,490
for you and potentially one o'clock in the morning for me. It's 10 30 a.m. in Australia.

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:06,010
That's who I was talking to. It was good indeed. 16 hours ago. But welcome back. We're doing more

8
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:14,760
Mario Sunshine shoe eating stream. That's yeah. Well, I'm glad you made it. I, how did you know?

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,680
I've got like four different shoes here on plates and shit. This is, that's kind of weird. How would

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:37,819
you know that? I was gonna eat them all. Damn. One day, here's a list of ideas that I say that

11
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,819
I'll never do, but I would like to because I'm just right now, which is I'm just spit balling

12
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:51,500
this to you. What have I had like six or seven shoes custom made out of edible licorice or

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,780
something and they looked very real. I paid like a lot of money to have these shoes look really

14
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:11,080
fucking real. And I ate them on stream and pretended they were Willy Wonka like lose a bet

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,439
at some point in the stream. Now this is, this is exclusive to you guys because if I ever not,

16
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,020
I'm never going to do this. If I ever do this, you guys will know. But an hour goes by in the stream

17
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
and I make a bet with you guys and I'm like, oh, you know, fine, whatever. If I lose this bet,

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,340
I'll eat fucking 10 shoes. And everyone would be like, what the fuck? And I lose it. And then

19
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:43,370
here we go. The camera goes on. You're supposed to eat shoes on March 12th. You can't put that

20
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:55,370
there right now. That's not even real. Why is it to be 10? I don't know. Why not? Welcome back. I

21
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:12,740
have 26 shines in Mario sunshine. I'm having a lot of fun. Game's great. Evidence. Hold on. What?

22
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,610
I said, I wait, I said I was going to do this already. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

23
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:38,520
hold on. Did I actually say this like four months ago? Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

24
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:51,099
This is like back, this is like a year ago. I said I was going to eat a full shoe on stream. If

25
00:03:51,099 --> 00:04:05,000
sans was confirmed and shoot, uh, he was last yesterday. Oh no. Why did I think this is,

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,180
why did I know this was going to happen? I mean, smash.

27
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:21,269
Well, I, what do I say? I said right here, March 12th. And so the shoe eating stream will be

28
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:31,959
on, uh, March 12th, 2020 market on your calendar. You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

29
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:45,779
Yep. All right. Mark it on your calendar. Uh, Freddy dread gave 50 subs. Holy fuck, dude.

30
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:54,860
Thanks for the 50 subs. Freddy dread coming in. Yeah. All right. Well, fuck it. You know what

31
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,870
I'm doing. Never lied about eating the shoe. No, did I? Uh, last time I looked at my calendar,

32
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,269
it was not March 12th. It was March. I don't even know what days don't there's no such thing

33
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,589
as a day anymore in my brain. Only like weeks. All right. So it's March 5th.

34
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:21,050
I got plenty of fucking time to get a full shoe on stream. We had a wink. We actually did.

35
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,129
Welcome back to Mario Sunshine. I'll give you a look. Those of you that have not been around

36
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,930
the last, uh, it's gonna say few days, but it was actually less than 24 hours ago.

37
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:49,509
40 blue coins, 26 shines and zero regular coins. Uh, where do I want to go? I'm just,

38
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm obsessed with collecting, but Freddy dread, that was an absolute shitload of subs.

39
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,209
Thank you for the ridiculous amount of subs. You did it again. You did it a second time,

40
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:18,899
like two, a minute ago. Oh my fucking God, Freddy, a hundred community subs from Freddy dread.

41
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:34,180
Jesus. Thanks, dude. That's a lot. You're supposed to do, you're supposed to do pachinko. Yeah. I

42
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:48,220
said I would, I said I would do it today, but I didn't say when. Did I? Yeah, I did. And then

43
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:56,279
Austin Atlantis gave five community subs as well. Thank you, Austin Atlantis. I'm doing it. I'm

44
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:07,829
going. I wish Nintendo would stop making bankable games and just make pachinko machines. Well, you

45
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:15,529
say that, but over the next 10 to 15 years, uh, all of those, all those Betty white machines

46
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:24,089
and all those, like, look at the cute kitty cat slot machines are going to get replaced by Mario

47
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:36,009
Sonic and like solid snake and shit. Time stamp this, mark my words. Like the Elvis machines,

48
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,620
gone. All of them. The Alfred Hitchcock slot machine, all of them gone, replaced with

49
00:07:42,620 --> 00:08:00,839
Super Mario slot machines. Garin fucking T. How am I feeling? I'm feeling all right.

50
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:14,899
I'm feeling all right today. No, I'm sorry. I'll get it when it comes back. He's lying.

51
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,649
Now, if you missed it yesterday for some, I don't know. I have like fucking mystery pain

52
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:27,050
around my whole body. Right. And we already talked about it, but like, yeah, I got my like tongue

53
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,410
started hurting yesterday. It was just weird. And it like kind of freaked me out for like 10 minutes.

54
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:39,129
But oh my God, I missed it again. I guess this is the equivalent. If I, uh, if I was sitting there

55
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:45,220
waiting for a bus in real life and I'm on the phone, like talking to my mom or something and

56
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:54,460
the bus pulls up twice and I don't get on it. I got to get on the fucking bus. I got to get home.

57
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:05,429
I got to go home. Freddy dread. Holy shit. 200 bucks, 20,000 bits from Freddy dread,

58
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:13,929
a hundred community subs and $200 in bits. This is one of my favorite games. Thank you,

59
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:21,019
German. My man. This game's awesome. I've never played it. This is fucking crazy, man. Thank you.

60
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:33,580
I go. I got to get on the bus. I have to get on the bus running behind the bus.

61
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,419
No, stop, please. Please. No, no, no, no. I'll get on. I'll get on. No,

62
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:46,970
we're going to wait again. I have to memory a fucking four year old. Just get on the boat. Now

63
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:55,620
Nocturne, Nocturne, I have to turn a hundred bucks each shoe. Wait, I got to get on the bus.

64
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:07,029
Just wait a minute. Okay. Uh, Nocturne gave us a hundred dollars. Remember I told you how red it

65
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:14,889
was yesterday. Read it and it's a ton of more money now. Like right now is hundreds and hundreds

66
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:23,129
and hundreds of dollars each shoe, March 12th. I don't, and Hey, don't fucking, I'm going to,

67
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,139
I got to trust you guys not to talk shit about this. Cause if I get a custom made edible shoe

68
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:38,259
for March 12th, you bet your ass that you better not be telling anybody about that.

69
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:46,009
You got to be in on the joke. All right. How many do I need? Eight. But thank you both of you.

70
00:10:46,009 --> 00:11:05,429
Seriously. Leather is edible. If you think for even one, one second that I am going to eat

71
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:19,399
a real shoe on stream and like die. You're crazy. Oh, this sucks. All right. I know how to do it.

72
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:31,850
I know how to do this. The ultimate joke. You got to get in like right here. All right. Now right

73
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:53,580
there. Okay. Nice. What the fuck was that? I got it. Okay. These are the worst ones. I got to make

74
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:00,629
sure the final one is one of the really easy ones up top. I need to see where am I going? All right.

75
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:07,909
There's one. I got to get the ones up. I want to get the ones up top last. The star definitely

76
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:21,850
goes in the middle. I am certain of that. Okay. There's only two more. I thought I just fell off

77
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,860
the edge and I was about to, I was about to be very, okay. There's the one all the way in the

78
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,139
end there. I got to go for that one next. And then there's the last one is the one all the way to the

79
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:49,340
right. I got to get that one. All right. Make it easy. Let's go. This is the camera. Just

80
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,330
fucking camera was just like a straight into the machine. I couldn't even see.

81
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:26,200
So have we determined, is it impossible for me to do this? Get in the corner right there.

82
00:13:26,200 --> 00:14:01,370
Mario's kind of quirky. Yeah, he is very quirky. What are you doing? Get in there, get in there.

83
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:20,299
Come on, push it. Ah, this is going to get Jeremy floored. Wait, what? Why is that happening? All

84
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:25,240
right. No, no, no, no, no. Why, why is that happening? What the hell is that? I, why can I

85
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:35,720
fly with it? Why is it pushing me? He's got the fucking thing. All right. Hold on. See, it's like

86
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:46,940
shoving me to the right. I'm not pressing. It's just like, it's tossing me over there. Dude, what

87
00:14:46,940 --> 00:15:03,450
the fuck? Dude, dude. See, what the fuck was that? I have to jump to this one. I have to jump to

88
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:21,179
that one. I have to. It's got, I have to do it like this because it doesn't, even if you,

89
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:27,830
this is really weird. Even if you jump over it, the game just decides it's just, it's going to

90
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:34,980
throw you like I'm not pressing. I'm in trouble. Holy fuck. That was close. Let go of the nozzle.

91
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, God damn it. Get in there, please. Don't you fucking even think about it,

92
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:03,450
but get in there, man. What the fuck? Somebody gave so many subs. Somebody had so many.

93
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:15,659
That's a hundred subs. I'm almost out of fucking water too. Hold on. Who just gave a hundred subs?

94
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:22,539
Austin Atlantis gave a hundred community subs. I took it. That's like a trillion dollars.

95
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:32,500
Holy shit, dude. Thanks for the hundred subs added to those. You got one. Nice.

96
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm almost out of water. I'm so paranoid. Oh, that's it. All right. New strategy is go for

97
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,679
the one on the left first. Cause that one's the, that one's just the hardest one to get.

98
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:17,849
Start crying right now. Cry now. There's more subs. I got it. I got it. Okay. I got it.

99
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:31,259
Another 25 from Freddie Dredd. Holy shit. You guys are going fucking crazy. I got the whole

100
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:53,220
left side. I got the wrong thing selected. How does that happen? What? Huh? Did I just go through

101
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:06,519
the wall? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? I thought you

102
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,880
couldn't do that. There is no wall. I thought there was a, wait, there's not a back wall.

103
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,240
What the fuck? I'm trying. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a

104
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,359
minute. There's a, there's a glass back wall. Isn't there like an invisible wall? How do you

105
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:37,339
not fly out? I, I can't believe I got the hard one too. What? There is in some places. What the

106
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:52,650
fuck? Don't miss the bus. What the hell is that? I thought, I thought I was going to just slide

107
00:18:52,650 --> 00:19:05,339
down like I always do out the back. You mean you tell me I can fall out that way? I hit also. All

108
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,059
right. Hold on. It's all like, okay, I'm missing the bus. Yes. I, but I'm taking my eyes off the

109
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,019
screen. But you have to remember I'm not, I'm waiting at the bus stop and somebody's driving

110
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:21,160
by the bus stop every few minutes throwing $500 off the window. And I'm like, wow, do I get on the

111
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,839
bus? I got to try. Get on the bus. Hold on. Let me, I gotta get that money. Hold on. Fuck the bus.

112
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,880
Then like 10 more minutes go by. Like another person just like, Hey, hey buddy.

113
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,140
It like throws like $200 off the window. I'm just like, holy shit. That's fine. I gotta get that

114
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:59,799
money. I got people driving behind the bus. Just tossing fucking checks out of it. All right. I'm

115
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,480
getting on. I'm getting on. I'm getting, I can't believe I can fall in the back. Hold on. Wait a

116
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,720
minute. I'm so tilted from what just happened. I'm so fucking mad from being falling out the back

117
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,039
fucking window. I can't believe this is even possible. You can't fall out the front. Why can

118
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:33,539
you fall out the back? Let me on the bus. Oh my goodness. Why did I say I would do this level?

119
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,740
This is like the joke meme level that nobody does. They spend five minutes on this level. They go,

120
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:58,390
nah, I'm just going to play the fucking actual video game. I don't care who did it.

121
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,190
Guess what? LeBron James can dunk. I don't go, you know, I'm going to dunk first try too. Let

122
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:39,619
me get that. Give me that ball LeBron. And I go, I go to dunk on LeBron and he fucking does like

123
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:47,980
the most embarrassing, just like smash the ball out of my hand. And he, it does, it's so hard.

124
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,299
It does so hard that it's like, boom, boom, hits me like right in the nose. And I'm like,

125
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,819
oh, my nose like blows up with blood and shit. And I have to go to like the hospital.

126
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:30,359
I don't care. Wait, you met LeBron. You're getting dunked on. This is fucking so stupid.

127
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,740
Stop grabbing the wall. Let go of the wall. Why? What are you doing?

128
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:18,180
Okay. I figured it out. I don't do, although that was, you can fall off the fucking edge.

129
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:55,400
Don't do that. Okay. That kind of doesn't work. This is so fucking ridiculous.

130
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:32,779
It's going to work if I get it. No matter if the game is horse shit, I still made it work.

131
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:45,210
Just throws you to the right no matter what. All right. I got to get the ones on the right.

132
00:24:45,210 --> 00:25:27,990
Okay. I got it. Don't fuck it up. One more. I'm preparing. Here we go.

133
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:48,250
It's not over yet. It's not over yet. It's not over yet. It's not over yet. I have to get in there.

134
00:25:48,250 --> 00:26:31,609
Do it again. Do it again. Just relax. Do it again. Do it again. I don't want to, I'm holding the

135
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:36,789
ball right now. I got LeBron's in front of me and he's laughing. He's like, oh, you're going to try

136
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:46,089
it again. Yeah. In a minute. All right. Whenever you're ready, man. Whenever you're ready to go.

137
00:26:46,710 --> 00:27:06,869
Wait a second. I'm just trying to figure out which way to go. No. Hey, I mean, I got like a

138
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:13,690
bunch of meetings to go to, but can you try to slam dunk already? Just shut up. I'm going. I'm

139
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:29,609
going to go when I'm ready. You know, you know who I am, right? I know who you are. All right.

140
00:27:30,410 --> 00:28:21,180
Here I go. You can't slam dunk, Don. I did it. Phew. I'm glad I don't have to do that again.

141
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:41,130
He's just a guy that slam dunked LeBron. Yeah, I did. I did. I miss winked. Oh shit. I did.

142
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:56,730
And a ton of money. All right. Let me get hurt. Oh shit. I did it. I just did it again for fun.

143
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:16,089
Another one. Wait, what did it say? All right. Now I can, it's been 30 minutes. Can I actually

144
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:26,630
play the fucking game now? 10 more. Oh my, wow. How much, how much money came in? That's a lot.

145
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,710
Oh, we had, we had the hundred subs. We had 25 from Freddie. We had five from Labster,

146
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,869
10 from Javelin, a hundred dollars from Core Monster. Congrats on not beefing. 10 more from

147
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:56,579
Atlantis. You guys are fucking crazy. Thanks. That's a lot of money guys. Thank you. I want

148
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:12,099
to go over here. Did I get all eight here? No. Oh, I know. I got them all. I did get them all.

149
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,259
I did get them all at Gelato Beach. I remember this one. All right. Well, you can't back out

150
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:31,019
for some reason. Why can't you know back out of this menu? Press Z to see the levels you read.

151
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:40,170
Oh, imagine if your memory card got corrupt. Oh, there's a hundred coins. I don't, I'm not,

152
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:50,339
I don't need to do that. All right. I got five. We don't have the lowest. Eight at Gelato Beach.

153
00:30:51,670 --> 00:31:01,180
Five. I think I have, oh, the park. I only have one at, in a park. All right. We're going to the park.

154
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,460
I got to go in the cannon though, right?

155
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:36,660
I don't know why they didn't add that. That should be the noise he's making.

156
00:31:38,819 --> 00:32:00,869
Here we go. The beach cannons secret. It was a middle school joke. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

157
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:08,549
Shut up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shut up. I'm just kidding. Shut up. I'm just kidding. All right.

158
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:31,099
What are we going? Let's get him. Pepehans. He hates me. No, I don't. How long you've been,

159
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:38,569
how long you've been watching this channel? Don't, I've already told you guys that 98%

160
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:54,539
of everything you hear on this channel is fabricated. Okay. Pick it up. Stop running

161
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:27,960
your fucking head into it, man. Pick up the bomb. That's, this game is really fun. NA aim.

162
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:40,119
Let's go. So what's in here? Wait, is this another one of those levels?

163
00:33:43,579 --> 00:34:15,300
It's one of these. I do appreciate the, uh, wall paper. Okay. There we go.

164
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,869
I just blanked. I just like blacked out for a second. I don't know why that was. I just blacked

165
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:50,619
out. I forgot. I'm blacking out. All right. Here we go. I'm good. All right. I'm fine. This is not

166
00:34:50,619 --> 00:35:30,679
that bad. Oh, kids. Where am I? What happened? Wait. Oh, I'm fine. All right. What's going on

167
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,050
with that fucking control scheme? All right. What the fuck's going on with this fucking control

168
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:57,000
scheme? Am I getting pushed with air? Why does this feel so strange? What's this air pushing me?

169
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,119
I'm being pushed in weird directions. All right. Right. When that thing go now,

170
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:16,739
I got to settle the fuck down. It's fucking air pushing me.

171
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:37,610
There's air. There's air pushing me. All right. What the fuck is going on? Why is this so strange?

172
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:59,130
There's air like moving me like left and right. All right. Break the crates is your emulator.

173
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:06,460
No, this isn't the original. You know, why would you go up there?

174
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:24,469
There's copy protection on the disk. That's weird. All right. Here we go. I'm going to count

175
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:33,099
right when the last one falls. Maybe one, two. Okay. It's two false seconds.

176
00:37:33,659 --> 00:38:20,409
Here we go. And one, two, one, two. Okay. Two. Holy fuck. Holy fuck. Hey, this one's for free.

177
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:43,340
I stopped doing the TikTok thing. I don't know why I'm doing that. Turn up the game volume.

178
00:38:43,900 --> 00:39:09,480
Nah. Yeah, sure. How's that? Better? Apologize. This is my red coins of the pirate ships.

179
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:26,199
Cool. Nobody has a name called tag me when Derma's upset. That's just. See, now you're just

180
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:42,500
gaming the system. Now, you know, you're just getting all these tags. The chat is devolving.

181
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:50,360
It's all right. It's all right. All right. We got to get up there. Do I ride the teacups?

182
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:09,110
That's kind of fun. Red coin. All right. Get on the pirate ship. Oh, okay. So any more red coins on

183
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:25,880
these ships? Okay. Uh, across. Oops. I hit my head. Whatever. Blue coin. I'll get it in a minute.

184
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:41,989
Nintendo is watching. Oh, well, that's good. Uh, Nintendo, when are you going to put this game

185
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:48,469
somewhere else besides a GameCube disc? It's probably one of the top three Mario games you've

186
00:40:48,469 --> 00:41:07,480
made. They all they left out. Oh, well. Oh shit. I didn't. That was like, no, we, you port, no

187
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:22,409
switch port, no e-shop. Where's the GameCube e-shop? Shit. That's another question. Well,

188
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:36,179
that was still got it. And now from here, I'm going to go. Oh my God. I mean this way.

189
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:55,059
And I missed it. And I fucking missed it. How? Oh, it's, it's just exhausting.

190
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:04,170
Hold on. My hands are sweating. Do you know who would make a trillion dollars if you made a

191
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,530
controller? Is there like any anti-sweat controllers? All right. I mean, first,

192
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:16,780
let me stop speaking so I can play a video game. Why do these things have to be made of this hard

193
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,659
sweat plastic? Why can't this be made of a cloth or something? Like I want a cloth that I can change

194
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:26,500
out. Like you do your laundry, you do, I give a fucking pillowcase. Why can I, why's there no

195
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:40,840
control of pillowcase? I'm doing this so wrong. Just go across. What? I don't need, I don't need

196
00:42:40,840 --> 00:43:12,869
the boats anymore. Wait, can I get in here? That's a 5,000 IQ coin. Oh, I'll get another one.

197
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:29,400
You need gamer gloves. No, but that's, that makes it worse. All right. We got a good view.

198
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:46,519
What the fuck are you doing? Get out of my way. Blue shell fucker. I hate you. Oh, fucking Nintendo

199
00:43:46,519 --> 00:44:00,570
Wii, Mario Kart. It's coming for me. All right. I gotta get up there. I think I do have to go on

200
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:16,340
the, that I have to get on these and then just not miss. Can I do it from here? Hmm, maybe. Can I

201
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:38,420
walk? Hold on. I think I just do it from here. As long as I'm not stupid about this. Oh, why is

202
00:44:38,420 --> 00:45:17,800
this game running at 12? Dude, your PC sucks. I'm not on the sheet. This guy move. This guy don't

203
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:30,650
move, does he? Well, shit. I have to like hover over there. Okay. We'll go back up.

204
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:53,159
Can I just shock him and then ground pound him? This camera is going to make me

205
00:45:53,159 --> 00:46:17,849
throw up. Okay. Now I can get those. Or can I? I need water or else I'm not going to be able to

206
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:41,989
get up here. This is going to be bad. Okay. I think I can grab these without needing to fill water.

207
00:46:41,989 --> 00:47:19,860
Let's see. Come on. Grab it. Okay. Do it again. Where are the other five coins though? All the

208
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:26,900
way up. This, this, this level might be the worst place for the camera. It's just in a building

209
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:49,260
every five seconds. God damn it. I can't see anything. Just, I want to get in the, I want to

210
00:47:49,260 --> 00:48:23,559
get in the fairy go round, whatever this thing is called. Holy shit, Nintendo. I'm terribly sorry,

211
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:41,750
but this ride is currently under maintenance. Wow. Nintendo. Wow. Whatever. I don't even need to

212
00:48:41,750 --> 00:49:09,659
say it. I need to get over there. I think I can just get there. Can I put you out? I got to get

213
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:23,989
rid of you. I'm trying to hold the thing down. It didn't hold it down hard enough. So I move.

214
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:58,650
It's frustrations settling in. Mad at children's games. Somebody told me I was going to get really

215
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:03,400
mad here. They were like, I can't wait until you get to level seven. Sucks. And I was like,

216
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:55,190
what is he talking about? This is Super Mario Sunshine. Grab it. I can't even be more like

217
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:14,329
your brother. He's not here right now. He's at school. All right. How do I, there's two more

218
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:24,440
coins. Where the fuck are they? Where's my, I can't spend my blue coins to get a red coin scanner

219
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:37,079
all the way up. Do I have to, I got to go over there. All right. I'm going for it. I'm going to

220
00:51:37,079 --> 00:52:04,329
be smart about this though. Or are we? We'll find out. Can I punch them from below? If I, okay,

221
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:10,679
if I electrocute them and push them, can I, will they, do I get electrocuted by them if they,

222
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:25,670
if they're over me? Well, he's going to shock me, right? I thought they shocked you. All right. Now

223
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:43,699
I got to get on that thing. Pack them from below. I don't want to talk to them. They're electrified.

224
00:52:44,340 --> 00:53:06,199
I didn't like that. What are your thoughts on Mario Kart 9? Um, I don't, which one is that?

225
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:12,809
There's been so many of them. All I know is Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart Wii, and then all of them

226
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:20,630
are the same game in my brain. The ninth one. Yeah, but which one is that? How many have there been?

227
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:35,000
How many Mario Karts are there? Is eight? Nine? Double dash? Yep. I know, but how many are there?

228
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:45,269
Is eight deluxe? Is 14? No, no, no, no, no, no. Mario, Mario Kart. How many Mario Karts are there?

229
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:53,670
Mario Kart 8 deluxe for the Nintendo Switch. Yeah, it is eight. I wasn't even looking at the

230
00:53:53,670 --> 00:54:08,260
fucking screen again. God damn it. I'm like looking up shit on Google. How do I move this?

231
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:25,110
Can I like push this? Pull it? Can I grab this? Stomp it? Open that. Hey, I think you're in need

232
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:29,829
of a pair of my special sun shades. Oh, well then again, maybe you're not ready. You need to spend

233
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:34,820
a bit more time here. How much more time do I need to spend here? I've been here for like,

234
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:45,780
I've been here for like four days. How about you? I brought this baby to view the sunflowers,

235
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:57,300
but this looks unsafe. I didn't think Yoshis were bad creatures, that's for sure.

236
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:22,119
Wait, this is, there are actually Yoshis here? That's not a Yoshi.

237
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:43,190
That's like hermit crab. Whoa. Oh, they're draining the fertilizer from the ground.

238
00:55:43,190 --> 00:56:06,170
They're drinking all the fertilizer in the water. Hey, wake up. All right, bring another one up. Back

239
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:22,380
to life. Plant, plant, plant, plant, plant. Here we go. Point, point, point. What? Fucking

240
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:41,210
speech is fucking. I hate that. Fucking speech is fucking. Nope. Don't think so. Why are you

241
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:47,380
doing this? Is one life worth more than another? I don't make the rules in Super Mario.

242
00:56:48,340 --> 00:57:34,969
Nobody's dying. Don't you guys know? They're going away. They're all on vacation. Over here.

243
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:52,309
What? What happened there? Oh, you didn't spin around. All right, do it. Hey, why are you not

244
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:59,219
over here? Aha. You can't do anything about the sand. Can you? Oh, I got to be quicker than that,

245
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:30,460
huh? It's bringing you back to life. Yes. That was not even that bad. I see people on speed runs

246
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:44,869
do that. I can't do it. They do it like backwards into the thing, you know. Beat Dark Souls 3 on

247
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:49,190
stream, but you can't beat a single Mario game. I'm gonna beat, I'm beating this right now. Look,

248
00:58:49,190 --> 00:59:07,110
don't you see on your screen? All right, let's move. Hurry, Mario. I can't imagine what the

249
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:32,659
poor princess is going through. Mario, please save her. Hey, Moni. Hey, you. Give me that Yoshi egg.

250
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:47,179
What the fuck? He was in my way. He was in my way. Wait, Moni's dead. Go on.

251
00:59:52,340 --> 01:00:20,340
This is what was supposed to happen. Give me that fucking egg. Oh, he missed it. Good. You're just

252
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:33,739
as stupid as me. You really are a Mario clone. He's trying to hit the same jump, but can't hit it.

253
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:50,360
He's like, oh, whatever. He's just about to ride that Yoshi too. He needs bananas. I don't want

254
01:00:50,360 --> 01:01:21,579
to get those. Stay right here, Yoshi. I got this. Here's your food. Ooh. You want some water?

255
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:36,920
You befriended Yoshi. Make him eat with B. Holy shit. I didn't even know Yoshi was in this game.

256
01:01:52,340 --> 01:02:15,429
Yoshi's... Wait, I'm orange? Okay, so you can... What am I going to be? Juice.

257
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:36,940
Look at how long his tongue is in this game. All right, I get another one, right?

258
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,300
There's an egg over here. Okay, there it is.

259
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:51,110
No, that's such an old joke at this point, but it's still funny.

260
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:56,070
All right, let's go get some food. And that's... Ah, this is cool.

261
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:08,340
Whoa. Juice. What does the juice do? It's just like water. All right, let's eat a bunch of food.

262
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:23,349
All right, let's be orange. Now, where do I want to go? Anywhere, huh? Let's go back. Let's go this

263
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:56,730
way. But Yoshi can't come in here? Red coins on the water. Why can Yoshi not go in there?

264
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:10,760
Three minutes and paying attention to cutscenes. He's no dogs allowed. Yoshi's not a dog. He's a

265
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:21,820
lizard. Hey, Kazzy, thanks for the five minute resubs, Kazzy. Appreciate it. All right, so we

266
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:35,019
have to do... We have to go this way. Lizard. He's a lizard. He's a lizard. He's a lizard. Is it better?

267
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:53,340
This level. Pepe left. Do I have to do the race thing again over there? Is that what this is?

268
01:04:54,139 --> 01:05:12,679
Did you do pachinko yet? Yes, I did. What's this? Collect eight coins before the timer runs out.

269
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,119
Well, okay. I'm pretty good at this.

270
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:57,960
Stop the car. Stop the car. Jesus, man. What are you doing? You don't go around a rotary

271
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:40,260
ten fucking times. What's wrong with you? Oh, God. It's baby Mario or baby Bowser. Wait,

272
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:49,929
there's a shine in... Wait, what? I can't believe there's a shine over there. Come here. Give me that.

273
01:06:50,570 --> 01:07:08,019
Right, so I was just about to turbo... Yeah, shoot. Turbo nozzle. All right, how do I do this?

274
01:07:08,019 --> 01:07:13,380
Turbo nozzle. This is a Yoshi up here. All right, there was a thing. There was a shine.

275
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:22,329
Where was it? Through these doors? There was some door I could go through. Which one?

276
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:38,139
Run just ran through doors. Is this thing fun? Holy fuck, this is kind of cool. Holy shit,

277
01:07:38,139 --> 01:08:02,809
this is fucking awesome. I'm so pissed off. Another one. What the hell are we doing over here?

278
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:12,039
Wait, where is he? Where is that? Give me that turbo nozzle.

279
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:40,470
He's up. Where is he? He's like over here. Up there. Which side? This side? No, don't make me do this.

280
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:51,270
I'm sorry. Stop. Nobody say that for the rest of this room. I don't want to hear that ever again.

281
01:08:51,989 --> 01:09:19,479
Is he not up here? He is up here. I need the hover. Maybe I don't.

282
01:09:26,840 --> 01:10:07,750
He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. Found him. Really? Aha. Right in the back.

283
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:21,909
Get him. Hey, you. Get back here. How much more do I have to hit you?

284
01:10:24,810 --> 01:11:04,970
Ah. Ow. Oh. Can this fucking hit him? Why is this not hitting him? Earth is happening.

285
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:40,489
Are you seriously moving all the way over there? Mom, my game's broken. I can't go this far. Shoot,

286
01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:48,579
I was supposed to rocket jump. This game makes me thirsty. This game makes me want to pee.

287
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:54,630
This game makes me have to piss. It actually was the original title of the stream,

288
01:11:54,630 --> 01:12:15,659
but people were upset by it, so I had to get rid of it. Damn it. Oh. All right, I made it.

289
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:31,340
Does it wink? Chain? Chomplets? Unchained. I hate this place. I hate this place. This place. I hate

290
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:38,069
this place. Why? Best level, worst level. This level sucks. Does it suck?

291
01:12:38,069 --> 01:13:01,819
Um. This place looks like a modded Call of Duty Zombies level. Hey, Mister, I think you could spare

292
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:09,180
us a hand. This dear lady's pets have decided to go on a little rampage. No, no, no, no. Not

293
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:27,020
the bees. They seem to be acting normal. So we have to put out the, uh, the chomps. All right,

294
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:39,220
that's not bad. That's not bad. What's wrong with this place? They're lighting on fire again. I'm

295
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:51,750
trying, I'm preventing it from happening. Maybe I should clean the area first. Come here. Do they

296
01:13:51,750 --> 01:14:04,329
have to go back in a cage or anything? Is it, is it, I'm trying to get them back in their pen or

297
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:25,060
something? Try cooling its head off. I just did. Okay. Do I have to get them all in a certain time

298
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:44,550
limit or something? How many are there? Two? Three? There's one other one right here. Okay, now what?

299
01:14:44,869 --> 01:15:15,529
Ow. I, well, okay. You can, I grabbed their tails and throw them into the pens. Do I have to open

300
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:27,130
them or something? Or into the, throw them in, where's their water? Come on, come here. Go in

301
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:51,659
there. Am I killing it? Okay. I think that's what I need to do. Do the other ones. All right. Let's

302
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:55,100
go. Let's do the thing that everyone said. Do it, dude. What are you stupid idiot? Do it.

303
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:06,420
Now there's two more. I don't hate this place. Am I going to hate this place? I don't hate this

304
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:22,069
place. Wait, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. I didn't get it. Now

305
01:16:22,069 --> 01:16:38,279
stop, stop, stay right there. Don't move. Okay. One more. I just saw you. Where are you? Over here?

306
01:16:39,239 --> 01:17:02,779
Right here? Right here? Like that. There you are. Come here. Come here. I used to do that all the

307
01:17:02,779 --> 01:17:08,729
time versus Bowser in Mario 64. You would do that and miss and then you'd fucking fly off a cliff

308
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:13,130
and smash the controller into the ground and it would explode into like 5,000 pieces.

309
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:36,470
What? Am I saying mama? Come here. You have to go this way. All right. Got a clear shot.

310
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:50,010
Eight ball, corner pocket and go. Yeah. That was like a wicked annoying thing to say. I'm aware.

311
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:59,319
Eight ball, corner pocket. Yeah. I know that was, that was annoying, but whatever.

312
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:14,899
You guys just have no idea how exhausting it is to pretend every day. I brought this up yesterday.

313
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:26,380
It's, I'm just exhausted. What's it been an hour? God fucking tired. Remember to pretend

314
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:34,220
in every video game, one hour of pretending is actually like two to three hours of being

315
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:43,380
normal. I'm exerting 300% more mental fortitude. Man, I'm just fucking tired. Let's go back in.

316
01:18:52,149 --> 01:19:09,899
Oh no, it's a race. I feel bad for the people that don't know that's a joke.

317
01:19:10,939 --> 01:19:22,579
And they're just like, what the fuck, man? It's me, Paintissimo. And now listen, see that flag over

318
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:52,869
there. Hmm. That flag up there. Are you ready? Three, two, one, go. Three, two, go. Oh, I fucked

319
01:19:52,869 --> 01:20:34,180
it up. I just, first time I've been on the level, guys. I don't speak cursive. Actually, cursive is

320
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:38,279
out of the, you'll be right, cursive is out like this. If I was speaking cursive, if it was out

321
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:41,399
like this, every single word, every single, everything would fall right into each other.

322
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:59,539
Every single word, there would be no beginning of any senses. That's correct. Oh, the crack's

323
01:20:59,539 --> 01:21:07,579
kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Three, two, one, go.

324
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:43,029
Smelly a little. Kick head. Don't do that. Just run. Oh, that was not so bad. You're quick. Yes.

325
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:48,539
I suppose maybe I underestimated you a small bit. Perhaps you try again after you have practiced

326
01:21:48,539 --> 01:22:24,579
more until then. Bye bye. Go to the hotel. Go to the hotel. I don't know what that is.

327
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:32,630
Don't stop spoiling the game. You're spoiling the game for me. I don't know what that is.

328
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:41,479
You just ruined it. How am I going to enjoy the game ever again now? I want to do this again.

329
01:22:46,250 --> 01:23:05,270
Goopy Inferno. Oh, all the way.

330
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:21,659
No flood. Just my skills as a platform gamer. Can we talk? It's really tough being mayor,

331
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:27,020
don't you think? I've never been a mayor. I have no idea. It might be really easy for all I know.

332
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:58,180
All right. What do I got to get up there? Fine. Um, okay. Okay. Well, there's uh, all right. So

333
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:07,579
maybe I want to hear a coin. What are you going to do? Animal Crossing New Leaf. Um,

334
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:21,319
I'm just gonna play the new one. What's going on? Nintendo. Nintendo. I need you to. Thank you.

335
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:44,710
Can I get up there? Can I climb the tree? I can go over there. I'm just gonna.

336
01:24:51,579 --> 01:25:13,659
I have to jump on these guy's heads. Oh, you're hurting him. So do I have to just bounce?

337
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:25,899
I don't know. That almost worked. Almost. I'm not done with this. I'm, I'm having a fun time at

338
01:25:25,899 --> 01:25:57,670
face when Mario isn't there to save you because you are Mario. Who saves Mario? I mean, like,

339
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:02,550
guys, Mario is not invincible. I mean, just because he has a series of video games doesn't

340
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,829
mean that if he gets hit by a car, he's not going to break all of his bones and shit.

341
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:32,149
I have to bounce on these. So I'm going to try if I could do it. It'd be nice. They go all the

342
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:47,050
way over there. Right on these things. None of them are made out of water or anything.

343
01:26:48,250 --> 01:27:17,140
Wink. All right. Fine. Here's water. What about down here? What's this? Well, I figured it out,

344
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:39,210
but where do I go up from here? How do I climb this up? Oh, wait, I can move this thing.

345
01:27:39,930 --> 01:28:03,189
Why is it doing that? What? I rumble. I don't have any more coffee left. Disaster. Well,

346
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:14,810
I know where to go. Dude, we're going to get some fucking dunks. You know what I mean? We're

347
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:48,649
going to get the fucking dunks. Let's try this again. Watch out. You got to slam dunk on LeBron.

348
01:28:50,939 --> 01:29:12,729
No, I can't. No, stop. Oh, wait, there's a coin. 46 blue coins. Nice. Again. Here we go.

349
01:29:13,369 --> 01:29:21,750
Remember, there was a blue coin billionaire. What do blue coins do? Uh, I don't know. I'm

350
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:27,619
thinking you spend them on stuff. But I don't have a lot. I don't know. I didn't play this game.

351
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:34,970
Can you grab on to the- why are we- I'm trying to grab onto the- why can I not grab on?

352
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,329
I'm trying to just climb up to the top and just grab the top.

353
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:57,020
I have to jump off it? I can't just grab? I have to jump up into it. Shit, I just said the fucking

354
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:04,920
Voldemort name. Wait, why am I all the way back here? Oh, because I had game over.

355
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,310
I don't want to do that. I want to do something else. Where am I going? Where have I not done

356
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:32,779
everything? Park. Harbor. I haven't done Bianco Hills, the whole thing. You have the Yoshi.

357
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:55,060
Where the hell was the Yoshi? Over here, right? Whoa, what's up there? Wait, what's a bell?

358
01:30:55,699 --> 01:31:26,390
I'm gonna clean this bell. No, I won't. All right, bell. This thing is dirty as hell. Nice.

359
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:40,140
How does one get inside? I see. I see. I gotta go in one of those things.

360
01:31:41,100 --> 01:32:00,119
Whoa, right there. Can I get up there from here? Bang a left? I need to get all the way down. I

361
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:11,960
need to get up- how do I get over there? It's gonna be a weird way to get there.

362
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:31,380
All right, a bang of right? No, it's up there. I gotta use my mind's eye. All right, here's- this

363
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:43,640
is it over here. What the fuck? What's going on with this one? This funny streamer is unaware.

364
01:32:43,640 --> 01:33:00,979
You think I'm funny? Thanks. Do you really? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Funny looking. Still

365
01:33:00,979 --> 01:33:32,300
counts. I gotta clean that thing. I'm going over there. All right, let's get up there.

366
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:43,300
So how do I do that? I can probably- can I just rocket jump from here?

367
01:33:43,300 --> 01:34:09,880
Maybe. Is it just that simple? It might be that simple. It's so easy. That's kind of high.

368
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:43,029
You forgot to put it down. You gotta bring it down for me. Okay. All right, do I go back in the pipe?

369
01:34:43,029 --> 01:34:50,659
Yeah, I'm gonna go for it. Get pineapple on roof. Get pineapple on roof. I'm up here though.

370
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:57,020
Roof, pineapple, roof, pineapple. No, I'm already up here. No, I'm not. It just put me back to the

371
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:10,170
beginning. All right, fine. Pineapple on that roof. Roof, pineapple. Sure. Tongue glasses. Roof,

372
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:40,060
pineapple first. Hold on. Important. Roof, pineapple. All right, just throw it up there.

373
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:58,729
Bounce off this guy's head. Throw it up there. All right, I can do this. Hey, you- what?

374
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:40,470
Your taste changed. Yoshi. So what was the point of me getting the Yoshi up here?

375
01:36:41,659 --> 01:36:52,949
I walk somewhere with him over like the- on the tightrope. It went right through it. It went

376
01:36:52,949 --> 01:36:59,850
right through the rope. Can I get up back up here? All right, pineapple. Eat the pineapple.

377
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:22,550
Eat the pineapple on the roof. You guys on drugs? Roof, pineapple. There's a roof pair.

378
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:42,789
Wait, you're talking about the- wait, that? The giant pineapple decoration? Not an actual pineapple

379
01:37:42,789 --> 01:37:52,659
from like the shop. You're talking about the roof decoration. I didn't know you could eat that.

380
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:58,979
That's a decoration. That's a decoration. That's not- oh, eat the fruit on the roof.

381
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:05,510
You should have said eat the decorative pineapple. That's what you needed to say. You said eat the

382
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:10,149
pineapple on the roof. No, no, no. Eat decorative pineapple. I would have got it immediately.

383
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:46,010
Arena Beach. The manta storm. Where's Yoshi? He didn't get to come with me. It's kind of unfair.

384
01:38:47,829 --> 01:39:01,159
What's going on up here? Why are you guys inside a pipe? I heard this is a great hotel. I can't

385
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:15,100
wait to see my room. What a cool looking sunset. Spectacular. Two, three, four, five, six, seven,

386
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:52,119
eight. Eight coins. Good. Look at the sunset. Fine. Let's go. Uh, you probably should do something

387
01:39:52,119 --> 01:40:06,100
about that. Your stairs are killing people. Uh, okay. Well, what's your problem?

388
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:11,590
Oh, please tell me my nightmare is over. You can save me. I don't know why, but just look at the

389
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:16,069
very- just look- you just look very capable. Listen, it all started around noon. This giant

390
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:22,229
manta-shaped thing showed up. It was this paper, thin, floating silhouette. It came and covered

391
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:27,750
the hotel grounds in this electric goop. Then, oh, the horror in my beautiful hotel, my poor

392
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:33,739
building. It sank in the middle of that awful ooze. Why me? I've got the staff cleaning up,

393
01:40:33,739 --> 01:40:39,510
but where's my hotel? What am I supposed to do? I can't just sit back and, uh, it's- it's back.

394
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:54,300
That gossamer ghoul. Do something. Holy shit. This thing's pretty big. This song's kind of banging.

395
01:40:56,149 --> 01:41:12,779
All right, what- can I shoot it? You can clean it. It's cleanable. Here it comes. Okay, what does

396
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:21,670
that mean? Get out of the water, Mario. Mario, don't you know? This is shut- spraying the water

397
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:37,859
causes it to divide. Is it- is this thing even here? I tell you, this game is Spining of Isaac.

398
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:42,500
This whole game is Spining of Isaac. All right, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. Out,

399
01:41:42,500 --> 01:42:15,939
out, out, out, out, out. Get coins. Save from the trees. God. All right, we're getting crunches.

400
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:37,720
Yeah, we're getting crunchies. I don't know why. All right, where is he? There you are. They're all

401
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:56,170
stuck on- they're all stuck on the top of that thing. God. I need water. Oh my god, the crunches.

402
01:42:56,810 --> 01:43:24,819
I gotta turn it down. I can't hear these crunches, man. Give me that shit. Where's the water?

403
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:51,670
They are dividing into smaller units. I know. Die! Wait, are they co- are they going back together

404
01:43:51,670 --> 01:44:11,300
again? They're reconnecting, aren't they? Give me that. I need more coins. Trees. Get out of the

405
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:45,060
water, Mario. I need that tree. All right, let me get a look. No, no, they're everywhere.

406
01:44:47,060 --> 01:45:05,079
This is- holy shit. Get to work. I've- oh no. Okay, I'm gonna start- I'm gonna start over here.

407
01:45:05,079 --> 01:46:02,869
Come on. They're all in the ocean over here. Okay, here we go. Over here. I gotta get in there. Oh,

408
01:46:02,869 --> 01:46:28,119
look at that shit. All right, we're doing good. Not bad. I'm not breaking these boxes. Holy shit.

409
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:37,000
Now they're all after you. What? Oh my- get in the tree, Mario. Mario, get in a tree.

410
01:46:51,880 --> 01:47:16,489
Just spray from afar. It's working. All right, back to the ocean. Ow, you fucker.

411
01:47:33,109 --> 01:48:25,739
Okay, easy, easy. That was crazy. All right, now turn the volume back up. Now that we can actually

412
01:48:25,739 --> 01:49:04,550
hear. It's not crunchy audio. You did it. I did. Yeah. That was kind of fun. I'm just not even

413
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:08,550
gonna look. Should I just throw it behind me? I mean, I'm like half court. Let me just like-

414
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:37,909
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this. You ready? Okay, there.

415
01:49:37,909 --> 01:50:15,850
Okay. Wait, you didn't hear it? But it didn't swish? It's a swish.

416
01:50:16,329 --> 01:50:30,949
It bounced. I missed. I missed each time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Redo, redo, redo. That means I'm-

417
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:45,500
Oh god damn it. Shit, it wasn't even that fucking hard.

418
01:50:45,500 --> 01:51:15,699
I just got in. It doesn't go in and come out. No, I want- Fuck man, why is it so hard to find this?

419
01:51:15,699 --> 01:51:30,180
Basketball swish. Why is this so difficult to get this? Somebody make this video and you'll get

420
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:37,050
like 10,000 views. Just make a swish sound if I put it on YouTube. You'll get like 100,000 views.

421
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:42,810
Okay, that finally found it. Never mind. Thanks for uploading that. God damn it. I'm holding on

422
01:51:42,810 --> 01:52:02,970
to this. I don't fucking care. I'm holding on to that. Right. Oh, here's a swish. It was a

423
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:07,689
basketball fucking bouncing and hitting a rim and shit. Because I can't hear it. I just have-

424
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:12,569
Right now I have the game audio in my ears. I can't have both because the way that it's-

425
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:34,840
the game is captured. Whatever. All right, let's go in the hotel. It's Mario, right? Yeah, Mario.

426
01:52:35,479 --> 01:52:40,039
Listen, I have a feeling you can help me out again. Do the hotel as well. It's full of

427
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:45,670
ghosts. Is this a Mario? Wait, is this Luigi's Mansion tie-in or something?

428
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:50,390
So we- well, could you maybe look- just come inside. I can tell you're a miracle worker.

429
01:52:50,390 --> 01:53:09,609
Don't be so modest. When did the original Luigi's Mansion come on? They turn into platforms. Oh boy.

430
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:29,020
This is going to be interesting. The place looks familiar. This is the Mario 64 place.

431
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:51,020
This looks just like it. Hey, can I go in here? Do I need the thing to run through

432
01:53:52,069 --> 01:54:06,380
the doors? Maybe I should talk to the guy first. Hold on. Fire. Wait, I can actually open the doors.

433
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:18,439
Nope. You're invading somebody's privacy. There's nobody in this hotel. I'm the cleaning person.

434
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:38,890
None of these open. All right, dude. Well, I can't help you. You gotta help me.

435
01:54:40,569 --> 01:54:47,350
Give me the key. At this rate, I'll never get back home. Can you do something, please, Mario?

436
01:54:51,779 --> 01:55:09,859
Well, I'll try. No guarantees. Toilet? Oh, they're dirty toilets. Wait, these are not dirty toilets.

437
01:55:17,829 --> 01:55:30,069
They just look like that. Oh, what's this in here?

438
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:46,649
Shit decal. This place looks like a fucking bowling alley. Why? No, it doesn't.

439
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:56,680
Um, all right. What do I do here? Is it like a fire flower or something?

440
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:25,670
Do we go up higher? Okay, well, we go higher. Oh, there's another. Okay. Well, it was confusing.

441
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:32,760
That should not be in the game. That shouldn't be in the game. That's like unfair and it messes you

442
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:37,079
up and makes you think that there's coins and shit. That's unfair. They should take this out

443
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:59,689
of the game. Are they all closed? Oh, look, it's Pac-Man. Hold on. Anything else over here?

444
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:17,609
Oh, you have that in you though. Doesn't that mean you have that? That's so joked. I got joked.

445
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:36,979
Well, let's go in. See what happens. Three, two, one. Here we go. The secret level. Oh, great. This is

446
01:57:36,979 --> 01:57:48,310
gonna be fun. I love the background. That's the kind of shit that I want in my office. Those lights.

447
01:57:48,310 --> 01:58:04,409
What are they called? Uh, light brights. Light bright. Oh, I can break these. I gotta be careful.

448
01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:22,300
I don't want to break too many of them. What's the watermelon for? I think I may have just made a

449
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:36,789
mistake. No, I'm okay, right? Bounce and just make it take us low. Okay, that's sand. Uh, it's gonna

450
01:58:36,789 --> 01:58:56,100
fall. Let's go. Waiting too long. You're probably asking yourself, why are you leaving that?

451
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:07,720
Because I could have, see, I could have been bad. Uh, which way? Okay, there's the psycho way.

452
01:59:09,079 --> 01:59:14,699
I'm thinking about going the psycho route. Psycho route is get to the second one here and then jump

453
01:59:14,699 --> 01:59:29,239
all the way over to the right side. I'm doing the psycho route. I almost had it. It was close. It

454
01:59:29,239 --> 01:59:46,010
just went a little too far. Oh, I can get it. I can get the psycho route. I can do this an

455
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:59,939
infinite amount of times though. That's the one good thing. Get that camera in a good spot.

456
02:00:34,489 --> 02:00:52,550
All right, so just, but, uh, I can't reach that. That platform, that move? That shit move?

457
02:00:54,520 --> 02:01:17,930
That shit moves, right? I fucking seriously, I went like a tiny bit too far. I was trying to

458
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:44,310
be so slow with it and you pressed a stick a tenth of a centimeter and come on. It was such a pain

459
02:01:44,310 --> 02:02:30,779
in the ass to get over there with the psycho route. Saved it. I almost fucked it up. All right,

460
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:40,659
there we go. All right, I just have to jump. Don't walk over it. If you walk over it,

461
02:02:41,140 --> 02:03:15,109
you go all the way over the edge. Just be careful. Get that. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

462
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:34,010
I'm getting tuber. Sometimes it just comes out. I have, you have to like, it's okay. You know,

463
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:38,739
when they tell you, when, when you fight any fighter, like the karate or a taekwondo or

464
02:03:38,739 --> 02:03:43,939
something, don't they say you need to expel air and force out of you? You know, you have to like,

465
02:03:44,899 --> 02:03:51,779
the same thing is with video games. When you throw a punch in karate, you need to

466
02:03:52,729 --> 02:04:00,649
exhale. Same thing when you're playing a game, you want to make a jump. That's correct. Tennis

467
02:04:00,649 --> 02:04:10,569
is another one. Yeah, this is true. This is true statement. I'm not making that up.

468
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:46,279
Pitchers do it too. Yeah. And so don't streamers. Oh, I hurt my chest. Streaming is karate. No,

469
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:58,810
no, no, excuse me. That's a false. That's, that is what we call a false equivalency.

470
02:04:59,529 --> 02:05:13,340
I never said that. I didn't even read what he said. I lost it when I heard this was a four star

471
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:25,260
resort. I mean, come on water damage in the restrooms. That is so low class. It's not some

472
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:38,579
weight. What's this guy doing? Ooh, pineapple. My apologies, but the casino, excuse me. What would

473
02:05:38,579 --> 02:05:53,579
the word something about that words? Exciting me is not open for business quite yet. I need

474
02:05:53,579 --> 02:06:07,189
a pineapple. Uh, these free pineapple, pineapple, pineapple, pineapple, no pineapples over there.

475
02:06:07,829 --> 02:06:24,329
No, let's go upstairs. This level is unironically so good. It's, it's pretty fun. I don't, I don't

476
02:06:24,329 --> 02:06:31,060
mind. I miss Lammy. Like I'm Jammer Lammy. You miss I'm Jammer Lammy. I beat the game

477
02:06:31,939 --> 02:06:52,439
multiple times at coin. I'm leaving it for later. Where's the pineapple? Oh shit. Nice open free.

478
02:06:53,319 --> 02:07:01,819
This is free. This shit's just for free. Hey, that sparkle, could it be a shine sprite? Um,

479
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:23,609
yeah, move out of the way. Hey you, no one in the pool without proper swimwear. I mean, what was

480
02:07:23,609 --> 02:07:43,180
that? Hello? I get a really creepy vibe from this weird painting, but you want to know what I find

481
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:54,300
even creepier than that? Imagining how you got in here. You need pineapples? Fucking Nintendo.

482
02:07:54,300 --> 02:08:29,899
Uh, oh, okay. Creepy. Creepy. Cool. Uh, hi guys. Eek. What's wrong? The coin's fake. It's not even

483
02:08:29,899 --> 02:08:41,029
moving. That's a bad, terrible. I knew it. See? I'll get it. Stop running around. I want to talk to

484
02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:54,649
you. Stop running around. Suddenly a ghost came out of the closet. I'll handle it. Double tap

485
02:08:54,649 --> 02:09:28,760
right there. All right. Anything else in here? What about over there? Make the picture. All right.

486
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:34,539
What about you? Everybody has like their own personal pool. Do something about these ghosts

487
02:09:34,539 --> 02:09:52,899
and get out of my room, you weirdo. Oh shit. There we go. Where the fuck am I? This is ridiculous.

488
02:09:52,899 --> 02:10:03,000
This is crazy. I like this level. It's fun. I think the bed's made out of ghost. Wait a minute.

489
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:34,409
Where did you come from? I'm calling for help. Oh, but hold on. Uh, hi. Another room, I guess.

490
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:46,699
Streamer wet the bed. I did not. Well, where did I put that thing? Hey, have you seen a pineapple

491
02:10:46,699 --> 02:11:16,090
anywhere around here? Let's look. Pineapples? Anywhere in here? Pineapple? I don't see a

492
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:25,130
pineapple in here. Hey, whatever. It's super coin. Yeah. All right. Hold on. Do you have

493
02:11:39,510 --> 02:12:02,300
pineapple? Hey, found a, uh, another room. Cool. I found a pineapple. Nice. Cool.

494
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:14,619
It's a friend. It's just for fun. Pineapple. How do I move this guy out of the way?

495
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:27,590
Oh, there's more than one pineapple here. There's pineapples everywhere.

496
02:12:27,590 --> 02:12:57,079
Is it going to eventually work? Can I open the door? Is door locked? Wait, what? Wait, what?

497
02:12:57,079 --> 02:13:03,640
What? What? What? Why is the door locked behind me? Why? Why would the door lock behind me?

498
02:13:04,279 --> 02:13:20,619
Are you kidding me? Oh my God. Oh, the door locked behind you. Oh, for the love of fucking God,

499
02:13:20,619 --> 02:13:52,119
I have to do this whole thing again. Mario, you're a moron. Make sure to lock the door behind you

500
02:13:52,119 --> 02:14:03,939
from the inside, Mario. From the inside. Yeah. Good. How do we trust you with all this bullshit?

501
02:14:11,159 --> 02:14:50,199
Get out of my way. Okay. Give me a pineapple. Okay. Got a pineapple. Excuse me. Bye. Here you go.

502
02:14:50,199 --> 02:15:08,569
Oh, Yoshi. Make them pay. All right. I got Yoshi. Now we go up. We eat the ghost in front of the

503
02:15:08,569 --> 02:15:43,750
door. I guarantee it. If that's not what I have to do, I will... Why is this door open? Oh, hi there.

504
02:15:44,810 --> 02:15:55,880
My door's open and there's nothing to be suspicious of. How about a game of Jax? Ha ha ha. I thought

505
02:15:55,880 --> 02:16:25,369
they were ghosts. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, right. What are you doing up here? All these ghosts

506
02:16:25,369 --> 02:16:28,810
are causing us trouble. They're everywhere. Why can't someone come along and suck them up

507
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:47,799
with a vacuum? Why are you looking at me like that? Yoshi is just so good. What a little good boy.

508
02:16:47,799 --> 02:17:05,510
You know what I mean? I'm going to get lost up here. That's a guarantee. He didn't get the coin.

509
02:17:06,229 --> 02:17:22,010
Sorry. What does it take for Yoshi to die? Yoshi doesn't just die, right? You run out of juice.

510
02:17:22,010 --> 02:18:01,239
Is that for real? What? Eat him. Okay. What the hell am I... I think everything's clear.

511
02:18:01,239 --> 02:18:30,729
Can I go in the middle somehow? He's dying. Oh, he is. Of course I get stuck in the door. Okay.

512
02:18:30,729 --> 02:18:44,059
I need another pineapple. Wait. It might not be a pineapple. Check. It is a pineapple. Come on.

513
02:18:44,059 --> 02:19:05,319
I got to unlock the pineapple. This should be a banana at this point. I don't need him anymore?

514
02:19:05,319 --> 02:19:27,940
All right. I guess I did clear it all. What's the goal though? What am I trying to get to?

515
02:19:30,489 --> 02:19:57,899
Oh, look at this. Hey, remember me? Pineapple. What was the point of this? Oh, okay. I need a

516
02:19:57,899 --> 02:20:04,139
Yoshi. Please don't... Is that still there? Don't disappear. It doesn't disappear, right? Fruit

517
02:20:04,139 --> 02:20:18,659
doesn't disappear. It stays. Come here. Let's go. All right. Eat a bunch of fruit. Let's move.

518
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:37,209
How come Yoshi doesn't die in that water? What's up with that? It's too shallow. If you step into an

519
02:20:37,209 --> 02:20:42,629
inch of water with Yoshi on the beach, he dies. Is he a slug? I don't understand. Salt water?

520
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:26,680
Kill you. So, we got a... There's a blue... The blue sofa looks suspicious. Doesn't it? Nintendo.

521
02:21:26,680 --> 02:22:06,680
What's the point of any of this? The door? The crack that I'm missing? I think so. Or the walls.

522
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:25,100
Anything on the walls? That's it. Okay. Well, can I go back up? Can I just leave? Throw the door.

523
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:45,780
Can't open? We need to go back up. Is there another... I think there's another tile thing.

524
02:22:47,909 --> 02:23:09,829
Get in there. I don't know how that's possible to fall. Like, I'm gonna buy a lottery ticket

525
02:23:09,829 --> 02:23:44,969
tonight. Okay. Is... Over there. Is there a crack tile over there? Yep. And I'm seeing quite a few

526
02:23:44,969 --> 02:23:49,530
Pogchamps in the chat, but I need to correct you. I gotta have... I'm gonna cloud this because I

527
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:55,899
should. In the time it took me just to do that, I could have walked around the whole level two or

528
02:23:55,899 --> 02:24:10,260
three times. Take that. Hey, have you lost your mind? You can't just barge into a lady's room.

529
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:29,459
It's just not done. Get out. Shoo, shoo. What's that? Anything in here? Paintings? Yep. Anything

530
02:24:29,459 --> 02:24:39,420
else? You wanted me to leave, lady? Are you sure you didn't want me to exorcist Puke around your

531
02:24:39,420 --> 02:25:04,309
whole hotel room? Oh, sorry. What's this charge of $750? Well, there was exorcist Puke all over

532
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:12,139
your room, ma'am. You don't understand. I didn't do that. A strange little man with a mustache

533
02:25:12,139 --> 02:25:18,280
thrown in on a dinosaur and he puked all over the place. Okay, lady. Just pay the fucking deposit,

534
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:38,520
please. No, I'm not crazy. It happened. Am I missing something? Wait, like up here?

535
02:25:39,159 --> 02:25:53,739
I'm back. What was it? Nothing down there? There has to be something down here. What would be the

536
02:25:53,739 --> 02:26:26,790
point of you coming down here? Just don't. Blue coin? Fuck. All right. Is there another tile that

537
02:26:26,790 --> 02:26:36,469
I didn't do? Ah, over there. Fruit fly brain. Fruit flies are for their size. The electrons

538
02:26:36,469 --> 02:26:43,579
and neutrons in their brains are actually a thousand times their body weight. So if I

539
02:26:43,579 --> 02:26:53,559
am a scaled up fruit fly, then see, that's a mistake on your part. Ended up back down here.

540
02:26:54,200 --> 02:27:38,069
Okay. Did I go there? Is there one over there? There is. Wait, yeah. If I was a scaled up fruit

541
02:27:38,069 --> 02:27:43,350
fly, you guys, I would be able to control shit with my brain and be able to move objects with

542
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:49,510
my thoughts. You think I'm that intelligent? You're flattering me, but thank you. I got it.

543
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:16,569
You're giving flies way too much credit. Why does it still want me to go that way?

544
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:37,219
I'm going in there. It so badly wants me to be over there. Have I done almost everything here?

545
02:28:37,219 --> 02:28:44,059
Six. The shell's secret. I see flies move stuff with their brain all the time.

546
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:57,350
I've got to get in the shell. Oh yes. Oh yes. I don't need to listen to that. I know what to do.

547
02:29:14,139 --> 02:29:39,340
This place is cool. I like this place. This level is pretty pog. Shut up. Shut up.

548
02:29:40,299 --> 02:29:45,100
I, I, you, you can do it. I can't do it though. I can't, I can't say that. You can say that. I

549
02:29:45,100 --> 02:30:25,909
can't. Am I your parents? I've got to go in there. Oh shit. Fucking Nintendo.

550
02:30:33,719 --> 02:31:00,389
All right. I'm at about enough of this. I'm trying to skip this part. Wall jump.

551
02:31:07,829 --> 02:31:15,370
Uh, whatever. Don't talk about that. I think I can just make, I'm just going over here.

552
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:36,180
Right. Can I make this? I got to go over there. Uh, I'm going up a little higher. What's this?

553
02:31:36,979 --> 02:32:01,430
A yellow button. Press it. I don't, I don't care. Uh, okay. I got to get over. Can I land on one of

554
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:16,979
these, uh, ropes? I need to go from here to there. I got to go the other way. I need water too. Can I

555
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:30,729
can I? All right. Go water. All right. Let's go. People just like, oh, he fell again. No,

556
02:32:30,729 --> 02:32:35,620
that was intentional. It was an intentional fall. We're going to go with that way.

557
02:32:51,959 --> 02:33:16,059
Just walk. Just walk. Camera is, why are you doing this? Stop moving around.

558
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:45,020
Kill this thing. Oh my God. What's going on? Get off me. Get off me. Get off of me. Why is it on me?

559
02:33:45,819 --> 02:33:49,700
Please let on something. Please let on something. Please let on something. Please let.

560
02:33:50,260 --> 02:34:42,600
So I'm going to move over here and we'll go from here. I did it.

561
02:34:54,760 --> 02:35:05,829
Doesn't look that bad until you get up. Where am I? Seven lives by the way. Be careful. Oh,

562
02:35:05,829 --> 02:35:19,299
I could have just jumped off. Is there a one up anywhere? All right. This doesn't push you off.

563
02:35:19,299 --> 02:35:22,739
I got another whole another rotation. No, I got to be on this end.

564
02:35:23,299 --> 02:35:36,920
No, I got to be on this end. I got to be on this end now. Okay. And then, right. Okay.

565
02:35:49,819 --> 02:36:01,879
I got scared. We ran into the wall and got scared. I didn't want to press jump again.

566
02:36:01,879 --> 02:36:26,760
Karma, please hit the nails. Does that do anything? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if this

567
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:32,229
makes a bridge over here. So if I, am I going to get a one up from doing this?

568
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:50,200
That would be really, really annoying if I did. It's just two coins. I'm not doing that again.

569
02:36:50,200 --> 02:37:09,930
There. I did it. I don't have to do that ever again. All right. Let's try this again. No

570
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:13,610
hesitation. No hesitation. Just go. Ready? And now I'm going to do it right now. And here we go.

571
02:37:14,250 --> 02:38:17,270
You missed nails. I'm not going for nails. This is not nails percent. What is this I'm going to do?

572
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:27,700
Run up this? Um, I can slide. Run up? Am I sliding off of this thing? Can you slide? Let's test it.

573
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:45,340
You slide off. You slide off. Um, okay. Did the wall, I have to, you have to wall jump off the wall.

574
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:51,690
Or can I run across? Do I have to wall jump and then into the, can I just jump over?

575
02:38:52,569 --> 02:39:05,399
I mean, the camera zoomed right up my ass. So I couldn't tell what the fuck I was going.

576
02:39:21,459 --> 02:39:22,420
No, I don't care about the nails.

577
02:39:26,569 --> 02:39:31,209
Fuck the nails. Fuck the nails. Fuck the, I don't care about the nails. The nails can go to hell.

578
02:39:31,209 --> 02:39:36,649
Okay. I'm not touching a nail for the rest of my life. Even in my own home construction projects.

579
02:39:36,649 --> 02:39:40,969
I'm never going to use one. I'm not going to pick my hammer. I'm not never hammering a nail in.

580
02:39:40,969 --> 02:39:59,180
I got here so quickly too. I was like so focused. Hammer, you missed the nails.

581
02:40:06,020 --> 02:40:26,120
How's about that? I almost jumped off.

582
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:33,879
I almost jumped off. I would have been, I would have taken a, I would have gone BRB.

583
02:40:33,879 --> 02:40:37,479
I would not have sat here for that. I would, I didn't, I wouldn't even want to see the chat.

584
02:40:37,479 --> 02:40:42,520
I would leave for 10 minutes. All right. Stop zooming in. Okay. So if I just run up and jump,

585
02:40:42,520 --> 02:41:02,889
just go fuck it. Go. Holy shit. Okay. How we go up and then shit.

586
02:41:02,889 --> 02:41:08,540
Okay. So I have to wall jump off here.

587
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:19,579
Holy motherfucker. Oh, that was very, very bad, but I did it correct somehow. I don't,

588
02:41:19,579 --> 02:41:26,379
that was incorrect. So wait, left wall into back wall or back wall into,

589
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:38,860
left wall into back wall, I think. Right. Or back wall into left wall or just back wall into,

590
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:50,569
just go. I landed on an invisible ground.

591
02:42:38,819 --> 02:42:42,260
This one's moving too fast. Look at how fast it's going.

592
02:43:01,899 --> 02:43:17,139
What the fuck? Okay. Now we just jump onto the, just don't, just forget about that. The ground

593
02:43:17,139 --> 02:44:41,100
is moving. That doesn't matter. You got to do a, oh, I feel so bad. I feel so bad right now.

594
02:44:41,899 --> 02:44:48,860
You know what I mean? Like I just, I, I feel just, I just feel very bad because that's so,

595
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:55,579
oh, I, I have to do it again. Oh, I feel, I feel very bad. Oh, it's okay. I'll get it.

596
02:44:56,540 --> 02:45:04,950
Okay. You have to do a slide, a side jump onto it because you can't make it. Oh,

597
02:45:06,629 --> 02:45:13,110
you may have hit the nail too. And then I was just, you've not hit the nail. Fuck.

598
02:45:16,469 --> 02:45:25,399
Okay. Here we go. And sometimes the side jump, I can't get that shit to work.

599
02:45:25,399 --> 02:45:50,659
Sorry. I just had to, there was just a, I just had to let some air out of a balloon for a second.

600
02:45:57,879 --> 02:46:07,059
I thought I had it. Oh, you got, it's like, look, if you give up a home run,

601
02:46:07,059 --> 02:46:11,219
you got to pitch the next inning. You know what I mean? If you give up a fucking grand slam,

602
02:46:11,219 --> 02:46:14,180
you can't just like be like, I gave him a grand slam. I'm going to give up every grand slam.

603
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:17,620
Every hit is going to be a grand slam. You got to, you got to get out of your head. Here we go.

604
02:46:18,579 --> 02:46:45,799
What was that face? Now I'm just rushing. It's such a far away to get up there.

605
02:46:48,969 --> 02:47:02,360
Grand slam. Here. Boom. Here. Double.

606
02:47:05,719 --> 02:47:10,360
Oh, I had it. I had it. I did it. Like, I had like, it's like, you're waking up from a nightmare.

607
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:27,139
You don't even mean like you missed the last jump. It's like a nightmare. Wait. Okay. This is not

608
02:47:27,139 --> 02:47:35,190
that bad. Getting up here. It's when they start turning on you. You lose them to a kid's game.

609
02:47:37,659 --> 02:47:39,020
That's fine. I'm okay with that.

610
02:48:02,709 --> 02:48:25,049
I'm landing on you. Panic jump. It was right on the edge. I thought, why would you jump? I just

611
02:48:25,049 --> 02:48:29,049
thought I was, I don't know. I don't know. That's why I need a boat flex connected to my fucking

612
02:48:29,049 --> 02:48:48,409
thumb. Oh man. Oh, it's all over from here. Oh, damn it. I'm so, I keep, you know, okay,

613
02:48:49,129 --> 02:48:53,690
you don't keep seeing it in your head. Like I just, I saw the last thing and now I got to run

614
02:48:53,690 --> 02:49:03,799
up that the last one. Oh, I may never see that again. I got so close. And what happened there,

615
02:49:03,799 --> 02:49:11,319
sir? What was that? I hit my fucking head on the ceiling. Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,

616
02:49:11,799 --> 02:49:52,659
I ain't doing that. I don't care. I'm going to do Bianco Cove. Fuck that, man. Let's get him.

617
02:49:52,659 --> 02:50:08,739
Rage quit? No, I didn't rage quit. I'm still in the game. Get back here. See, that's the part

618
02:50:08,739 --> 02:50:16,739
of the game that I like. You know, the kid shit. Oh no, ouchies. Like, look out, he's jumping.

619
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:23,340
Like Rube Goldberg machine Mario levels. I mean, I'm not into them at the moment.

620
02:50:23,899 --> 02:51:03,530
Where'd he go? Yep. And you're the expert. This is a telltale game. What is this image?

621
02:51:04,899 --> 02:51:57,110
Okay, that is just a screen grab of me going like this. That's what I, it's still the worst joke.

622
02:51:57,110 --> 02:52:09,299
Yeah, I know. I'm completely and totally aware of it. I know it's the worst. Trust me when I say

623
02:52:09,299 --> 02:52:42,899
I'm very, oh, we have a Yoshi. Where's the pineapple? What is going on? What? Oh, sorry.

624
02:52:43,700 --> 02:53:02,149
I have autoplay on. Audio jungle. What's it doing? Audio jungle. Audio jungle. Turn it off. It's off.

625
02:53:02,149 --> 02:53:22,149
I turned it off. I need a pineapple. Anybody got a pineapple around here? We just got a pineapple.

626
02:53:22,149 --> 02:53:35,770
I need one. Very, very, very, very badly. Put it back on. All right. Let's see what we get

627
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:43,190
for autoplay for woosh sound effects. There you go. I can't hear them. So you tell me. I have no idea.

628
02:53:57,959 --> 02:54:11,020
Pineapple anywhere. So what is this? Red coins? Nah, I'm fucked this. I'm out of here.

629
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:43,690
All right. Wait a minute. I want to, let me, I'm going to go back to this town here. This place.

630
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:15,100
I don't know. I can't hear any of these. I can just see that they're titled. The runaway Ferris wheel.

631
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:50,659
Turbo stop. It went to a political podcast. This thing's going too fast. It's going way too fast.

632
02:55:53,639 --> 02:56:19,739
This is too fast. Why are these? This is called bad joke. Bad joke. It knows. It knows. It's self-aware.

633
02:56:23,139 --> 02:56:37,190
I just can see the titles. I don't even know what's playing. We're going to get so many of these.

634
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:44,809
I just water just hit me in the mouth. How I just spit in the air. I spit in the fucking air and it

635
02:56:44,809 --> 02:56:52,280
landed back in my mouth. That's what happened. That's it. That just happened. There's no water

636
02:56:52,280 --> 02:57:20,700
in the air. Las Vegas missed one. All right. We're going to get up to the, uh, the teacups

637
02:57:20,700 --> 02:57:38,440
or whatever the hell it is. There we go. All right. Up to the teacups. Oh, pineapple. All right.

638
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:43,049
That's where the pineapple is. Remember that. Remember where the pineapple is.

639
02:57:43,610 --> 02:58:03,590
Dude, we're getting fucked up here. Where are those? Where are the teacups?

640
02:58:09,399 --> 02:58:13,690
I just dropped my fucking Wemo.

641
02:58:25,030 --> 02:58:29,909
That one was intentional. I got that one. I got, I got that one in the bag. I got that one in the

642
02:58:29,909 --> 02:58:46,090
bag. All right. What do I do? How do I stop this? How do I stop this? Oh, there's a guy down there.

643
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:51,110
Oh, no one can ride the first wheel. This is so lame. When is it going to be fixed?

644
02:58:51,670 --> 02:58:58,940
As you can see, it just spins and spins and spins. Sorry, but this ride is not working well at the

645
02:58:58,940 --> 02:59:03,049
moment. Well,

646
02:59:13,979 --> 02:59:22,469
Did I get hit by this? There's a turtle up here.

647
02:59:29,110 --> 02:59:32,469
And they had to hire a new one.

648
02:59:38,969 --> 02:59:42,889
I have to jump over the, I can't, can I not just, can I seriously not grab this?

649
02:59:44,010 --> 02:59:52,489
I have to be able to touch it, right? 20 minutes later. Six hours later. Several bad puns later.

650
02:59:52,489 --> 02:59:57,540
One hour later. Two hours later. Three hours later.

651
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:33,139
I gotta go the other way.

652
03:00:43,020 --> 03:00:51,319
Okay, turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

653
03:00:51,319 --> 03:01:07,079

It's in here in this pool or something. No, that's a banana

808
03:34:42,180 --> 03:34:50,379
That's in a really weird place

So if it's all water, why can he stand in the pools?

812
03:35:34,250 --> 03:35:39,049
I mean, that's not shallow. It goes up to my fucking knees as Mario and he's like three and a half feet tall

813
03:35:39,729 --> 03:35:47,469
Where's this fruit? It was like on this tree

814
03:35:47,989 --> 03:36:11,239
Okay

815
03:36:11,239 --> 03:36:14,700
You fucking little gremlin

816
03:36:14,940 --> 03:36:18,069
You are taller than me and you can't stand in

817
03:36:18,829 --> 03:36:24,260
That water I don't are you just are you going in head first and holding your head underwater?

818
03:36:24,899 --> 03:36:36,000
Nice pink. This is great. How do I make it? I could eat that

819
03:36:36,520 --> 03:36:40,489
All right, you're now orange

820
03:36:40,850 --> 03:36:44,159
Please don't go over there. Don't go over there. Watch out

821
03:36:45,239 --> 03:37:05,719
It's knee-deep water Yoshi. Don't go over there. He's made out of cotton candy

822
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:26,719
Yeah, okay

823
03:37:26,959 --> 03:37:38,989
Doesn't matter doesn't matter which one I start on does it probably not it's just Frogger. Is it Frogger? It is Frogger, isn't it?

824
03:37:54,959 --> 03:38:03,000
What the hell wait, okay, holy shit, I didn't mean to do that the camera just fucked me up

825
03:38:03,920 --> 03:38:26,590
Okay, oh it moves I know what to do. Oh

826
03:38:31,420 --> 03:38:40,010
My god, I can't believe it. I can't fucking believe it. I can't believe it

827
03:38:40,010 --> 03:38:42,569
Well, I knew what exactly it was. Well, I don't even need to why did I even do that?

828
03:38:42,569 --> 03:38:47,049
I just freaked the fuck out for no reason. There was no free. I'll never do these

829
03:38:47,049 --> 03:39:02,950
I'm never gonna be able to do any of these fucking the depth perception. Just keep the camera here at all times

830
03:39:02,950 --> 03:39:07,659
Don't ever move it. There's no reason to ever move the camera from here like fucking Diablo

831
03:39:08,139 --> 03:39:16,440
I'm in trouble. Oh my no, no, no, I

832
03:39:18,090 --> 03:39:20,250
Had it be to fuck this

833
03:39:20,850 --> 03:39:32,750
Fuck it. Give me a break. Ah

834
03:39:34,069 --> 03:40:13,829
Climb it. Okay. I'm pressing the up button you fucker. That was the wrong thing to jump on

835
03:40:14,270 --> 03:40:18,920
Can I compensate this? Okay. We're good. We're okay, right?

836
03:40:19,600 --> 03:40:31,030
We're okay. We're fine. Just don't move. What do I do? We're good. This is the one

837
03:40:31,389 --> 03:40:49,889
No, it's not. It's this one. We're good. Now this time don't be a fucking idiot

838
03:41:39,639 --> 03:42:07,200
Do it right do it right no snow don't jump over there do it right do it right we're okay

839
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:09,799
We're okay. Everything's okay. We're okay

840
03:42:10,520 --> 03:42:21,319
Everything's fine. We're okay. We're gonna be fine

841
03:42:21,319 --> 03:42:32,889
You

842
03:42:36,500 --> 03:42:55,270
Don't have to rush you don't a you're not you're not a you have to go that fast man. I'm so incapable

843
03:42:56,629 --> 03:42:58,629
You don't have to go that fast

844
03:42:58,629 --> 03:43:04,110
I gotta go as fast as I can but it don't drop right now. Oh, I'm so bad at fucking video games of Mario, especially

845
03:43:05,110 --> 03:43:07,110
If my patience is out of a fucking goddamn

846
03:43:07,829 --> 03:43:11,510
Love weasel, you know what I mean? Like if I'm gonna I'm just gonna come trying to steal your eggs

847
03:43:12,350 --> 03:43:41,290
And even if there's like 40 spiders in there, I'm just going to do eggs. I idiot why why why guys?

848
03:43:41,290 --> 03:43:43,430
Um, I fell I didn't fall

849
03:43:44,719 --> 03:43:51,479
Okay, so I don't understand what the fuck I'm doing. Oh, I know what it was. Sorry. Sometimes I forget

850
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:56,200
people holding their foot down on the gas till it hits the bottom of their car and

851
03:43:57,680 --> 03:44:01,479
Flying by at 90 miles per hour. It's a little distracting

852
03:44:02,280 --> 03:44:03,680
Sometimes I forget

853
03:44:03,680 --> 03:44:11,059
Sorry, like pushing your gas down until you you hit the bottom of the car. Oh

854
03:44:13,739 --> 03:44:35,840
Safe I did this the first time and now I'm so anxious. I can't fucking do it again

855
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:54,680
Every time what am I doing? That's so wrong. It's gotta be a side flip. I didn't do a side flip first time. I did it

856
03:44:55,159 --> 03:45:19,340
Hey, okay

857
03:45:19,659 --> 03:45:24,040
You fucking weirdo. It's time for you to stop being such a weirdo and do this

858
03:45:24,659 --> 03:45:36,600
You fucking weirdo. Oh my god

859
03:45:37,780 --> 03:45:49,809
So misleading long jump that doesn't exist in Mario Sunshine. They deleted it from the game

860
03:45:55,440 --> 03:46:16,500
Shit your diaper. Hurry up. That's the blue button to leap

861
03:46:17,020 --> 03:46:21,520
What that's not true. Is that a lie?

862
03:46:22,180 --> 03:46:25,090
They like wait, is that a lie? That's not a lie Z

863
03:46:25,770 --> 03:46:38,930
That's not Z. Is it? No, it's not. No, you got to just go right at the top. I gotta count. Here we go

864
03:46:38,930 --> 03:46:40,930
I'm gonna count ready

865
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:43,930
One one two

866
03:46:44,450 --> 03:47:22,340
Three it takes like three full seconds to get to the top. Here we go. Fucking weirdo. Don't worry. That wasn't embarrassing Jeremy

867
03:47:22,520 --> 03:47:31,290
It's a don't it's okay. I had a diaper full of slime like three months ago. It's alright

868
03:47:31,290 --> 03:47:33,329
I think I'll be fine

869
03:47:33,329 --> 03:47:54,440
Five months whatever it was shadow Mario in the park. This one's kind of just for free isn't it?

870
03:48:08,610 --> 03:48:20,629
Here he comes. Have you ever grown a beard? I physically can't do it. I don't have enough hair

871
03:48:21,270 --> 03:48:27,799
That makes any sense. I don't have enough hair. It grows out like straw

872
03:48:28,680 --> 03:48:59,069
Darn it. I'll remember this

873
03:48:59,190 --> 03:49:04,540
No, I can kind of grow but it's blonde

874
03:49:05,299 --> 03:49:06,620
so

875
03:49:06,620 --> 03:49:14,149
Like here look, I'll show you but for instance, I'm gonna get I'm getting a little close just let you know. Let's see

876
03:49:15,149 --> 03:49:20,709
It's all the black there's tons of blonde hair in here that you can't really see

877
03:49:22,149 --> 03:49:24,149
so like

878
03:49:24,709 --> 03:49:28,430
It looks weird because there's a ton of blonde hair in there

879
03:49:31,750 --> 03:49:33,750
It's like black and blonde

880
03:49:46,170 --> 03:49:49,049
You

881
03:49:49,049 --> 03:49:54,120
Is weird is weird and even if I do grow this out it looks like

882
03:49:57,579 --> 03:50:02,500
It just it doesn't look it's not you don't want it like I don't want it on my face

883
03:50:02,500 --> 03:50:04,500
I like having a little bit

884
03:50:04,860 --> 03:50:11,100
Maybe after a few days of shaving. I think it looks okay. But once you go four or five six days after shaving I

885
03:50:11,700 --> 03:50:15,340
Look like I look like a fucking mutant or something. I look horrible

886
03:50:15,940 --> 03:50:28,000
Okay, what what's left what's left in this video game only three at the Sienna

887
03:50:29,120 --> 03:50:31,120
Serena Beach

888
03:50:31,399 --> 03:50:36,120
three eight

889
03:50:36,280 --> 03:50:37,600
five

890
03:50:37,600 --> 03:50:42,229
Two at Pianta Village. Oh, yeah, that one sucks

891
03:50:42,909 --> 03:50:51,569
What the airstrip? Holy wait, I've only gotten one from the airstrip only ones really is there only one there?

892
03:50:52,090 --> 03:50:59,569
There's only one okay. I was gonna say holy shit. That's kind of bad

893
03:51:00,090 --> 03:51:10,239
I'm gonna go to the beach. This one is the one with the house, right or I could go to the harbor

894
03:51:10,239 --> 03:51:13,899
Yeah, I'm gonna go to Rico Harbor. It's two or three there that I can get

895
03:51:14,420 --> 03:51:18,840
Well, I haven't been there in a long time. I don't remember where the hell it is

896
03:51:19,360 --> 03:51:32,209
This one right here

897
03:51:36,989 --> 03:51:38,110
No

898
03:51:38,110 --> 03:51:40,409
Which one is this one?

899
03:51:41,090 --> 03:51:57,440
Where's that coin pop up? Oh, okay. I've 54 coins

900
03:51:58,200 --> 03:52:19,659
What do I spend these in the hut? I hear a star

901
03:52:20,059 --> 03:52:26,920
How do I hear a star? Oh shit. Okay here I can get this

902
03:52:27,600 --> 03:52:49,940
All right, you got it, right? I got 55 of these things. All right to go to the hut

903
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:56,340
Like the marketplace is there somebody at the market or something?

904
03:53:02,049 --> 03:53:04,940
boathouse

905
03:53:04,940 --> 03:53:11,790
across from the cannon across from the cannon across from the cannon

906
03:53:12,389 --> 03:53:24,250
Down here and over there over here. It was in wait in front of me

907
03:53:25,290 --> 03:53:29,000
In front like what like in right in front of me?

908
03:53:29,719 --> 03:53:34,079
Literally like literally right in front of me turn around I

909
03:53:35,079 --> 03:53:36,479
dig right here

910
03:53:36,479 --> 03:53:39,090
Like this guy

911
03:53:39,090 --> 03:53:42,629
wrong

912
03:53:42,629 --> 03:53:44,469
spot with the M

913
03:53:44,469 --> 03:53:58,000
Behind you am I getting fucked with right now people about people

914
03:53:58,440 --> 03:54:01,379
There's people trying to tell me where to go and the people telling me the wrong way, right?

915
03:54:02,159 --> 03:54:07,120
Look to the left

916
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:10,319
This is so much information flooding the chat right now

917
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:14,250
Rico Harbor building now. It's on the pier

918
03:54:16,840 --> 03:54:18,159
Right here

919
03:54:18,159 --> 03:54:22,379
Well, you can even you can go in this building

920
03:54:28,840 --> 03:54:29,959
Okay

921
03:54:29,959 --> 03:54:33,760
It's up my ass and around the corner

922
03:54:33,760 --> 03:54:36,959
See when people say suit like that and that's like what I see and then I see left

923
03:54:37,479 --> 03:54:42,459
Remember that there's a stream delay where you're getting what I do

924
03:54:43,000 --> 03:54:45,559
Five to eight seconds after I do it

925
03:54:45,559 --> 03:54:48,799
So when I turn left to look left and you say left

926
03:54:48,799 --> 03:54:51,000
I did that five and a half six six seconds ago

927
03:54:51,000 --> 03:54:53,239
And then by the time you say it's right in front of you

928
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:57,159
I'm actually looking at where the boat was because if five seconds have to go by

929
03:54:59,040 --> 03:55:01,040
Wait ten blue coins

930
03:55:01,280 --> 03:55:04,229
Let's go five shines

931
03:55:05,350 --> 03:55:16,110
I've been hoarding these. Yeah, let's go. No refunds. Wait, should I not do this? It's two seconds ready?

932
03:55:16,110 --> 03:55:19,520
I wonder if I'm going to say one right now

933
03:55:20,120 --> 03:55:32,120
Six seconds. That was six seconds before I saw one in chat ready. Let's do it again on camera. So ready?

934
03:55:32,120 --> 03:55:34,120
I want you to say

935
03:55:34,399 --> 03:55:37,360
I'm gonna say a word and you have to say the second you see my mouth moving

936
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:46,049
point six seconds

937
03:55:46,049 --> 03:56:04,040
That was five point like eight seconds time it on stream. How would I do that?

938
03:56:06,600 --> 03:56:12,299
47 stars

939
03:56:18,790 --> 03:56:20,790
Congratulations, they do nothing

940
03:56:21,989 --> 03:56:25,149
Pull up a clock that how is that gonna do anything?

941
03:56:25,829 --> 03:56:33,479
It's whatever you see I could have a clock that's counting down and you would get the countdown five seconds after I start the countdown

942
03:56:33,920 --> 03:56:50,479
Put chat on screen. I

943
03:56:51,159 --> 03:56:54,159
That's I don't know. I'm busy

944
03:56:54,760 --> 03:57:05,260
Red coins in the water at Rico Harbor. All right, I'd rage quit this one. I'm back

945
03:57:05,260 --> 03:57:35,250
I have to get perfect timing here ready. Nope. I like caravans of red ones. Okay. We're good. Okay

946
03:57:35,250 --> 03:57:36,729
I'm back. We're gonna get it

947
03:57:36,729 --> 03:58:00,280
Holy shit. This thing is hard to control. I got time but damn this is okay. This is hard

948
03:58:00,280 --> 03:58:02,079
This is very hard to control

949
03:58:02,120 --> 03:58:18,829
Use the middle squid

950
03:58:18,829 --> 03:58:21,790
Wait, I thought I was getting I wasn't getting lied to yesterday

951
03:58:22,229 --> 03:58:30,299
So I have people who actually you really were going faster or slower

952
03:58:31,059 --> 03:58:41,159
Holy fuck. I thought everyone was just making that up. I thought people were just making that up

953
03:58:41,879 --> 03:58:46,760
Yeah, I could ever tell I could ever tell who knows who knows what's what's accurate and wasn't accurate

954
03:58:46,760 --> 03:58:50,040
I don't know. I could I could be you guys could just messing with me. Oh

Mario Mario fix the camera Mario Mario

957
03:59:48,399 --> 03:59:54,600
This is a great music video you're making but I would appreciate if I could get a better view of the of the game

958
04:00:18,649 --> 04:00:20,729
Guaranteed you will not finish this level. Oh, yeah

959
04:00:21,250 --> 04:00:28,000
Guthrie one three three seven write that name down. They're getting this up like in a few months if I feel like it

960
04:00:47,989 --> 04:01:35,020
Guaranteed follow the yellow brick road. Where's six? There's one in the air somewhere. Where is it?

04:01:45,670 --> 04:01:50,370
Swear to okay. It's almost like it's almost like this like an evil part of my brain that

963
04:01:50,870 --> 04:01:55,639
Magnetizes me to do stupid things like I it's like hubris. You know what I mean?

964
04:01:56,000 --> 04:02:01,000
It's like I'm magnetized to screw something up because I just told you that I was doing fine

965
04:02:09,700 --> 04:02:14,290
evil shadow

966
04:02:14,290 --> 04:02:16,090
audios desync

967
04:02:16,090 --> 04:02:35,190
Like I just need to stop talking about how things I'm doing are going

968
04:02:35,829 --> 04:02:44,360
Like when I'm cooking this hamburger sure does look like it's medium rare medium. Well, well

969
04:02:45,280 --> 04:02:50,959
Why is there a fire here now? Well, I burnt it. I burnt it. What's that smell stink smells like smoke. Oh

970
04:02:52,709 --> 04:02:53,909
shit

971
04:02:53,909 --> 04:02:58,959
Okay, like I gotta get off at this exit. Yeah this one right here

972
04:02:59,799 --> 04:03:02,360
But why am I not what why am I not going off on the exit?

973
04:03:02,879 --> 04:03:20,139
No, slow down. I just slow down. Oh, is that even possible?

974
04:03:20,139 --> 04:03:31,680
I could probably do open heart surgery on myself if I just didn't say that

975
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:33,760
It's just going pretty well. Oh

976
04:04:10,549 --> 04:04:13,790
My god, it's so hard to determine where that fucking coin is

977
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:45,139
Guarantee, you won't beat this Mario's made it at Dippin Dots. That'd be like kind of cool

978
04:04:45,620 --> 04:05:02,860
Is it like let me guess the eighth coin is like hidden somewhere in a stupid place

979
04:05:03,620 --> 04:06:23,879
Going this way. I'm not missing it. There's the last point. Let him suffer

980
04:06:25,200 --> 04:06:42,139
That's so mean. It's going too fast. This is going too fast

981
04:06:43,139 --> 04:06:47,659
Why did I jump on the pink one? Get over here

982
04:06:48,299 --> 04:07:13,360
All right, we're good. Sound is out of sync. Is it ready? How am I? The audio is ahead

983
04:07:13,879 --> 04:07:18,299
The game audio is ahead. Sorry. What are you telling me when it goes?

984
04:07:19,200 --> 04:07:28,770
The audio is ahead. I don't know how this goes

985
04:07:29,329 --> 04:07:56,309
Good. We good? Are we good? All right, let's do the next one. This game is fucking so good

986
04:07:57,549 --> 04:08:06,409
Videos ahead now

987
04:08:06,409 --> 04:08:14,520
Pachinko? I already beat Pachinko. Not fixed. Oh, Shadow Mario revisited

How about this? Ready? This might be good. How's this? Ready? Check it out. How we doing?

989
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:42,520
I'm too dumb to do that move. Me? Should I get this?

990
04:08:43,040 --> 04:09:24,010
Thanks for waiting. You're a hell of a guy. Oh, what was the person that guaranteed I wasn't gonna beat that level?

991
04:09:24,010 --> 04:09:52,239
You owe me a hundred dollars, right? It's always a hundred dollars. Every time. Not this time. This time you little shit

992
04:09:52,600 --> 04:10:49,879
Frizzy and cut it there. Go ahead. Imagine playing a Mario game where you suck at jumping

993
04:11:01,530 --> 04:11:13,190
I'm doing the like put my tongue on my teeth thing. Let's say, you know, somebody's pissed if they're like, nope

1013
04:14:45,409 --> 04:14:55,479

But what else is there? I won't play again. I can't play again. Can I play it was roulette?

1021
04:16:14,409 --> 04:16:31,680
What do I want? I'm looking for. Holy shit first try

1022

04:17:00,700 --> 04:17:05,440

Really, which one I'm gonna say right in the middle. Yeah, they this one right in the middle. Oh

1026
04:17:23,090 --> 04:17:25,090

04:19:08,219 --> 04:19:10,219
All right

1031
04:19:10,979 --> 04:19:16,229
This move

1032
04:19:16,709 --> 04:19:18,879
Does it does move

1033
04:19:19,799 --> 04:19:25,440
I think it's just watch out. Just watch out. It's all right. Watch this

1034
04:19:26,440 --> 04:19:29,000
That's room

1035
04:19:29,079 --> 04:19:36,629
Well, I can never ever ever believe I get on top of one of these I think so

1036
04:19:36,709 --> 04:19:39,549
No, I'm gonna go right one, two, three

1037
04:20:03,809 --> 04:20:07,649
Oh my god, it's moving

1038
04:20:08,049 --> 04:20:14,979
The black background the black background just the

1039
04:20:15,579 --> 04:20:21,059
Was warping around I thought it was going moving the black background and then done the 3d plane

1040
04:20:21,059 --> 04:20:27,620
I thought it was rotating. I thought it was moving up. Oh

1041
04:20:28,340 --> 04:20:42,180
It's all right. Come on. God damn it. It's cuz my camera was pointed straight down. That's a wrong wrong wrong

1042
04:20:42,899 --> 04:20:49,239
Fuck it. I'm not gonna need to do it again

1043
04:20:55,510 --> 04:21:16,959
Hurry up. I I jumped I tried jump. I just didn't I I I hit the jump

1045
04:21:26,989 --> 04:21:30,229
He's so it's a stress inducing

1046
04:21:39,329 --> 04:21:41,829
I want that

1047
04:22:10,360 --> 04:22:30,370
Jeremy why would you you're okay. I don't get fucked over by the cube. What way is this fucking turn it?

1048
04:22:32,950 --> 04:22:39,489
Holy shit, it was hard to tell. Oh

1049
04:22:48,579 --> 04:22:58,409
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't where am I? Oh my god, come on

1050
04:23:00,059 --> 04:23:08,049
It's just such an awkward thing with that background. I got it. I can't but how I had it to that was the end

1051
04:23:09,049 --> 04:23:26,260
It tilts around and you have to walk back up. You got to go back all the way over

1052
04:23:26,260 --> 04:23:28,260
I should get it this time

1053
04:23:31,899 --> 04:23:36,940
Okay, well it wasn't happening that rotation

1054
04:23:50,100 --> 04:23:53,489
Oh

1055
04:23:56,280 --> 04:24:04,909

04:24:20,489 --> 04:24:26,649
Holy shit, I almost blew it. I want some flashy see some flashy, right?

1057
04:24:28,010 --> 04:24:57,049
Sorry, it wants me to keep going back to this

1058
04:24:57,790 --> 04:25:06,729
All right

1059
04:25:06,729 --> 04:25:08,729

04:25:29,819 --> 04:25:31,659
Go, where is it?

Beach episode. No, but the the one with the casino in it that was the with the casino in it

stars do I have to have before I

1070
04:26:25,200 --> 04:26:26,879
What's the

1071
04:26:26,879 --> 04:26:29,760
What about the game completion for shines?

1072
04:26:35,860 --> 04:26:50,850
70 70 you need seven shines in each level. I think I'm getting there

1073
04:26:56,700 --> 04:27:00,809
Okay, so down below

1074
04:27:01,690 --> 04:27:04,829
Boo, big boo down below

1075
04:27:05,629 --> 04:27:30,379
Anything in particular to go down or do I have to just go up and then down?

1076
04:27:31,219 --> 04:27:39,399
Um

1077
04:27:40,879 --> 04:27:42,159
All right

1078
04:27:42,159 --> 04:27:49,200
I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna say if I don't be saying the word. This is gonna dump gasoline on the spark

1079
04:27:49,840 --> 04:27:51,719
Hey

1080
04:27:51,719 --> 04:28:03,819
We gotta go down

1081
04:28:03,860 --> 04:28:08,430
Yeah, we have to go down the bowling lane. I always wondered what the fuck was back there

1082
04:28:08,430 --> 04:28:10,430
You know, I mean, you know when you break to something newer

1083
04:28:11,229 --> 04:28:12,309
your

1084
04:28:12,309 --> 04:28:14,309
Your bowling lane that doesn't work

1085
04:28:14,790 --> 04:28:19,750
Like it's like, oh, I just think not working that guy goes all the way in the back where the pins are

1086
04:28:20,469 --> 04:28:23,680
It's like holy wait, what's back there? Oh

1087
04:28:24,879 --> 04:28:28,409
Nevermind, but you kind of want to see what's back here

1088
04:28:42,920 --> 04:28:47,559
Kill these guys or I'm an M right there

1089
04:28:49,829 --> 04:29:01,780
Killed them all I don't need to

1090
04:29:07,479 --> 04:29:38,120
Elevator take me back down talk to that guy. I can't seem to attack these motherfuckers. I'm just gonna talk to this guy. Oh

1091
04:29:38,879 --> 04:30:02,290
Okay

1092
04:30:02,770 --> 04:30:17,360
King boo is a slot machine boss. All right. Well, this is cool. This is awesome

1093
04:30:18,559 --> 04:30:29,030
Then it what have we got? You didn't get shit boo. Sorry, just stop it for spinning

1094
04:30:29,670 --> 04:30:47,559
Well, I guess now I get a turn

1095
04:31:06,920 --> 04:31:10,860
This guy's fucked. So I help this guy

1096
04:31:11,479 --> 04:31:34,950
Alright, we're good. I don't need to be lining this up with anything. Do I?

1097
04:31:41,350 --> 04:31:49,920
pineapples pineapples pineapples

1098
04:31:50,159 --> 04:31:57,079
Ineffective. It's just laughing at you. You sure

1099
04:31:57,600 --> 04:32:37,629
It's like sweating. Oh, what about this one? He seems to dislike spicy things. Now's your chance

1100
04:32:38,149 --> 04:32:48,520
My chance to jump on his I just put him out. I think I just put him out

1101
04:32:49,079 --> 04:32:55,600
Just helped him. I sprayed him with water. Yeah

1102
04:32:56,239 --> 04:32:58,239
Yeah, he's I've helped him

1103
04:32:58,719 --> 04:33:00,000
All right

1104
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:25,279
Spin it again. Is that nothing? He's a big waters, too

1105
04:33:25,759 --> 04:33:42,470
Spin it. All right hot pepper. Stop this for spinning and then go what behind him pull on his tail

1106
04:33:57,240 --> 04:33:59,240
Throw another one at him

1107
04:33:59,240 --> 04:34:04,139
Throw more fruit at him, I guess

1108
04:34:05,180 --> 04:34:16,880
Well, how all right, how would it change if I throw a fruit at him and he goes?

1109
04:34:16,880 --> 04:34:20,959
Oh, that isn't effective. But when he eats hot peppers all of a sudden now it hurts him

1110
04:34:21,599 --> 04:34:55,790
What kill these guys? Are you waiting for them to die fruits? All right, here we go

1111
04:34:55,990 --> 04:35:00,430
But what's the point do I need to stop this shit? It's just kind of annoying. What's the point of stopping it?

1112
04:35:01,310 --> 04:35:06,750
All right, we're gonna go up here and then I'm gonna throw this at him

1113
04:35:07,830 --> 04:35:34,810
Yes, sure. Let's go. I thought I just got thrown out

1114
04:35:35,450 --> 04:35:44,220
Yeah, I kicked out of the casino. I'm currently stun locked

1115
04:35:44,939 --> 04:36:26,159
This is how it ends. I need coins

1116
04:36:27,000 --> 04:36:30,299
Hey, look at that

1117
04:36:30,299 --> 04:36:34,200
Thanks for the coins

1118
04:36:34,200 --> 04:36:36,439
swell swell swell

1119
04:36:37,319 --> 04:36:54,990
He's turning down the audio a little loud. All right, he's dead

1120
04:37:03,200 --> 04:37:04,000
uh

1121
04:37:04,000 --> 04:37:18,299
Anus music

1122
04:37:18,299 --> 04:37:52,919
He said it because I only have one frame of reference for this so that leaves us with

1123
04:37:54,439 --> 04:38:05,799
There's more in here. What about that six scrubbing sirena beach

1124
04:38:11,150 --> 04:38:14,299
Not this again

1125
04:38:14,299 --> 04:38:20,490
Didn't I already do this?

1126
04:38:20,490 --> 04:38:24,330
Mario we got trouble that electric group is back where everywhere

1127
04:38:26,540 --> 04:38:29,439
Uh, oh by the way, you have three minutes

1128
04:38:32,729 --> 04:39:10,990
For what

1129
04:39:10,990 --> 04:40:59,680
You have to get everything or just like 80% or something throw barrels. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop

1130
04:40:59,759 --> 04:41:23,159
Whoa, what what what? All right. All right. What the hell? Where's my star many? Thanks friend. Oh shit

1131
04:41:29,389 --> 04:41:42,750
Many thanks. You saved me two free coins. Are there people down here? Wait, can I get two more coins?

1132
04:42:02,619 --> 04:42:04,060
Thanks mario

1133
04:42:04,060 --> 04:42:10,270
Yeah, nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice

1134
04:42:12,400 --> 04:42:14,880
The easiest four blue coins i've ever gotten in this whole game

1135
04:42:15,599 --> 04:42:30,220
All right, where's the guy that owns this place?

1136
04:42:30,220 --> 04:42:57,069
Where's the owner? That was great. Now. Here's a shine just for you

1137
04:43:13,229 --> 04:43:26,479
52 shines and counting and going right back in game fucking sucks last night

1138
04:43:28,439 --> 04:43:31,080
No, that doesn't work here. That doesn't work here. That doesn't work here

1139
04:43:42,840 --> 04:43:45,659
Shadow mario checks in

1140
04:43:45,659 --> 04:43:58,090
So episode seven is shadow mario every time it seems right makes sense. I guess

1141
04:43:58,810 --> 04:44:12,619
Go get him. I'll never believe it. We oh, this is gonna be an annoying chase, isn't it?

1142
04:44:15,529 --> 04:44:18,810
Get in there. Oh, he's gonna be going through weird doors and through ceilings and

1143
04:44:19,930 --> 04:44:21,610
All right. Let's go

1144
04:44:21,610 --> 04:44:34,909
Do that on purpose. Oh wait

1145
04:44:37,630 --> 04:44:39,229
They are they are fake

1146
04:44:39,229 --> 04:44:41,770
Which one's real?

1147
04:44:41,770 --> 04:45:29,560
Why is it not hitting him? Are you a little?

1148
04:45:32,009 --> 04:45:58,090
Yeah, I got you gonna die in the shadow mario level. Nope. He's still alive. Anybody else see the

1149
04:45:58,970 --> 04:46:04,509
other mario

1150
04:46:04,509 --> 04:46:11,279
Thought I did

1151
04:46:11,279 --> 04:46:15,470
All right. I think we have seven in most of these places

1152
04:46:16,720 --> 04:46:17,680
seven

1153
04:46:17,680 --> 04:46:19,319
seven

1154
04:46:19,319 --> 04:46:21,080
seven

1155
04:46:21,080 --> 04:46:23,000
nine

1156
04:46:23,000 --> 04:46:26,380
seven eight

1157
04:46:26,380 --> 04:46:28,430
two

1158
04:46:28,430 --> 04:46:37,259
Two and okay, that's the other pipe. So I gotta go

1159
04:46:40,119 --> 04:46:44,490
It's up there. Okay. I need the rocket. Give me the rocket. Can you throw it up here to me, please?

1160
04:46:44,569 --> 04:46:48,029
Just throw me the rocket toss it to me. I'll catch it. I swear to god. I'll catch it

1161
04:46:49,389 --> 04:46:52,590
No, dude, I don't want to throw your phone that far. I'll catch it. Just fucking throw it

1162
04:46:52,990 --> 04:46:57,229
Oh god, can I just hand it to you? I'm just gonna walk over to you and hand it to you. Just throw it dude god

1163
04:46:57,950 --> 04:47:15,200
Okay here one two three, please don't break. What are these guys doing over here? Are you slacking off?

1164
04:47:15,849 --> 04:47:28,959
You're slacking off. What happened to the phone? Uh, it tumbled down the stairs

1165
04:47:29,520 --> 04:47:43,020
Is there a case on it? No

1166
04:47:43,419 --> 04:47:44,939
Dummy, right?

1167
04:47:44,939 --> 04:48:04,380
All right. Let's go get the here. Here we go. What the hell is

1168
04:48:07,529 --> 04:48:09,529
This weird like picnic basket flag is this

1169
04:48:28,880 --> 04:48:33,500
Oh, right. I forgot about this. I was like, yeah, i'll come back here. Fuck this

1170
04:48:34,380 --> 04:48:37,290
I gotta go under and then up. All right

1171
04:48:59,310 --> 04:49:06,909
Hoopy oh

1172
04:49:16,299 --> 04:49:32,360
I remember I was like, why is it moving? Why why why is it moving man? What's going on? Why is it moving?

1173
04:49:33,610 --> 04:49:37,049
Wait, I was supposed to press jump. I was supposed to jump. Oh fuck. Oh, no. I'll come back later

1174
04:49:37,770 --> 04:49:46,779
Get out of the way. Hey

1175
04:49:46,779 --> 04:49:48,540
Don't look at me

1176
04:49:48,540 --> 04:49:53,959
Leave me alone

1177
04:49:53,959 --> 04:49:55,959
Get out of here. Stop

1178
04:49:56,439 --> 04:50:03,639
Oh, what the heck i'm gonna come back later

1179
04:50:12,880 --> 04:50:25,180
Dear what the fuck am I right now? It's the wrong. No, this is the only thing I can do

1180
04:50:32,779 --> 04:50:35,419
Okay, can I rely I can walk on here

1181
04:50:37,689 --> 04:50:39,689
The goal is up there, right?

1182
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:06,560
Should I just shimmy and

1183
04:51:06,560 --> 04:51:16,509
This feels incorrect

1184
04:51:16,509 --> 04:51:19,310
Oh, okay that you went over the fucking banister mario

1185
04:51:19,950 --> 04:51:32,810
This is definitely the wrong place

1186
04:51:58,490 --> 04:52:32,669
Easy easy easy

1187
04:52:32,750 --> 04:52:47,979
What dammit calm down? I that was a good guy like

1188
04:52:48,919 --> 04:52:51,319
David or cheese just struck out in the bottom of the ninth inning

1189
04:52:52,119 --> 04:52:57,880
Game four of the 2004 fucking alcs. You know what I mean? That was what that was. That was what that sound was

1190
04:53:03,689 --> 04:53:21,720
That was like an old man screaming at the tv mad because there was a strikeout a plus b is a long dive jump

1191
04:53:31,790 --> 04:53:32,909
and

1192
04:53:32,909 --> 04:53:34,439
Why?

1193
04:53:34,439 --> 04:53:36,439
Why did that why was I never told?

1194
04:53:39,020 --> 04:53:44,220
Why is why it's been 16 17 hours in the game, why don't you know this

1195
04:53:50,110 --> 04:53:53,389
Because it was funnier. What do you mean? It was funnier, but

1196
04:53:54,110 --> 04:54:06,270
It looks big as fuck today

1197
04:54:06,509 --> 04:54:22,569
Okay, that was fucking stupid

1198
04:54:23,130 --> 04:54:26,009
It bumped into me. I jumped up. I didn't press any buttons

1199
04:54:26,330 --> 04:54:55,580
The thing when when it swayed back to start to fall bumped me and knocked me up turn the

1200
04:54:56,060 --> 04:55:46,000
It's gallding right now to the police station. I don't know what that is now. I can run through the doors

1201
04:55:46,560 --> 04:56:00,729
We do this first here, but it's all gonna be okay

1202
04:56:04,400 --> 04:56:07,680
I only have one health for one life. Whatever

1203
04:56:08,880 --> 04:56:18,380
Okay, where am I?

1204
04:56:18,380 --> 04:56:19,340
um

1205
04:56:19,340 --> 04:56:25,229
Is safe. Holy shit it is

1206
04:56:40,810 --> 04:56:46,159
I tried using the new jump and it didn't work out for me

1207
04:56:47,180 --> 04:57:06,240
unfortunately

1208
04:57:06,240 --> 04:57:09,069
spin jump and dive

1209
04:57:09,069 --> 04:57:15,790
The problem with me though is reliably spinning the analog to like do that. I could just I you know me

1210
04:57:15,790 --> 04:57:17,790
I might just walk the fuck off the cliff

1211
04:57:19,119 --> 04:57:29,099
Wait

1212
04:57:29,099 --> 04:57:32,409
Okay

1213
04:57:32,409 --> 04:57:33,849
Why am I still alive?

1214
04:57:33,849 --> 04:57:42,000
That doesn't save very much time

1215
04:57:42,000 --> 04:57:46,400
You have to show you you have to spin jump every time there. You can't just regular jump or dive or anything

1216
04:57:46,799 --> 04:57:57,439
You have to actually spin jump on every mushroom. I'm kind of glad that happened because I only have three

1217
04:57:58,000 --> 04:58:00,000
I have one

1218
04:58:00,080 --> 04:58:20,169
One up, you know what I mean?

1219
04:58:21,450 --> 04:58:22,729
Mm-hmm

1220
04:58:22,729 --> 04:58:33,979
What's the downside of the game over? I'm just having to run all the way back here. I'd rather be able just to start over again

1221
04:58:42,200 --> 04:58:44,680
All right. Oh same strategy. I'm doing that again

1222
04:58:49,740 --> 04:58:51,740
It didn't have enough momentum that time

1223
04:58:51,740 --> 04:58:56,680
So we're not gonna do that strategy again. We're gonna just do it the normal way. I didn't have enough momentum

1224
04:59:34,330 --> 04:59:36,330
All right, here we go

1225
04:59:36,330 --> 04:59:40,169
These are cool to have on the level like have those on the level. They serve a purpose

1226
05:00:01,419 --> 05:00:10,520
um

1227
05:00:10,520 --> 05:00:14,279
I did it. I just I spin jumped. Uh

1228
05:00:18,650 --> 05:00:23,610
I'm going the wrong way. How am I supposed to know what the way I i've never played this game before

1229
05:00:25,580 --> 05:00:35,470
Are they like five different holes? I don't I don't know how am I supposed to know that?

1230
05:00:36,349 --> 05:00:53,020
These are the only ones I can reliably get to right now

1231
05:00:58,430 --> 05:01:00,430
There's one over here and one over there

1232
05:01:00,430 --> 05:01:07,099
Where's the third one?

1233
05:01:07,099 --> 05:01:09,580
This is dangerous. But what is it for blue coin?

1234
05:01:13,099 --> 05:01:15,740
I can I go I can't jump in there. It's right there

1235
05:01:16,540 --> 05:01:28,009
Can I go that way see if I can go all the way around

1236
05:01:30,270 --> 05:01:31,389
All the way

1237
05:01:31,389 --> 05:01:42,720
Now there's one back here

1238
05:01:45,919 --> 05:01:48,299
This is a hole

1239
05:01:48,299 --> 05:01:50,139
right like it

1240
05:01:50,139 --> 05:01:51,680
It's not a hole

1241
05:01:51,680 --> 05:01:57,950
This looks like a hole to me

1242
05:01:57,950 --> 05:01:59,709
No. Oh, there it is

1243
05:01:59,709 --> 05:02:14,090
I can also go back here

1244
05:02:14,090 --> 05:02:18,400
Well, i'll try this one

1245
05:02:18,400 --> 05:02:20,000
Where does this bring me?

1246
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:33,049
Please leave me alone

1247
05:02:37,470 --> 05:02:39,470
You two are fucking with me right now. Just

1248
05:02:39,709 --> 05:02:41,150
Look some other way

1249
05:02:41,150 --> 05:02:56,240
Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me and then

1250
05:02:59,319 --> 05:03:01,319
Oh Jesus, what the fuck?

1251
05:03:18,299 --> 05:03:20,299
Which way is he going?

1252
05:03:28,189 --> 05:03:30,029
Holy shit, he's right behind me

1253
05:03:30,029 --> 05:03:37,229
Okay now

1254
05:03:37,229 --> 05:03:45,020
This is what do I do?

1255
05:03:45,020 --> 05:03:46,700
I just had to walk

1256
05:03:46,700 --> 05:03:48,700
The wind shit is gonna be over here, isn't it?

1257
05:03:49,840 --> 05:03:51,840
I didn't know there's gonna be a springboard

1258
05:03:52,080 --> 05:03:54,479
Do you see how fucking much I jumped off that?

1259
05:03:55,119 --> 05:03:57,119
That was like a boing

1260
05:03:58,159 --> 05:04:13,310
I don't care about that

1261
05:04:13,310 --> 05:04:15,310
I can just make this as a jump, right?

1262
05:04:15,470 --> 05:04:16,909
I of course I can

1263
05:04:16,909 --> 05:04:35,599
Is this a spring? Is this a spring?

1264
05:04:58,939 --> 05:05:01,020
Oh god. Oh man. This is

1265
05:05:06,430 --> 05:05:09,310
No, no, is this not is that not this? This is not a tight rope

1266
05:05:09,869 --> 05:05:17,049
Oh, why can I?

1267
05:05:17,049 --> 05:05:25,310
Okay. Thank you

1268
05:05:25,869 --> 05:05:27,869
The camera

1269
05:05:39,479 --> 05:05:44,680
This place sucks

1270
05:05:44,680 --> 05:05:46,680
I'm trying to like point dive

1271
05:06:01,529 --> 05:06:05,450
No, I don't want to do that again. I had to juke like four people

1272
05:06:07,819 --> 05:06:09,900
Do the speedrun skip? I'm going for it

1273
05:06:09,979 --> 05:06:13,900
I'm gonna go for that because that's the only way I ever liably know my brain will try to do this

1274
05:06:14,220 --> 05:06:16,220
I'm going for the speedrun strategy. You ready?

1275
05:06:17,319 --> 05:06:19,080
Check this shit out

1276
05:06:19,080 --> 05:06:27,709
Which way was that?

1277
05:06:27,709 --> 05:06:33,580
Hey, remember which way was that? This way?

1278
05:06:35,290 --> 05:06:39,049
I'm going for it. I'm getting up there. I ain't going the real fucked up way. No way

1279
05:06:39,849 --> 05:07:12,240
I'm going for it. I'm gonna get this shit

1280
05:07:14,319 --> 05:07:15,599
Check this out

1281
05:07:15,599 --> 05:07:19,819
You'll be reading about me in fucking newspapers after this one

1282
05:07:24,200 --> 05:07:26,599
I I he went over the edge. Oh my

1283
05:07:27,319 --> 05:07:28,680
I

1284
05:07:29,450 --> 05:07:34,009
I he he decided to to parkour over the edge instead of just

1285
05:07:34,810 --> 05:07:37,689
getting

1286
05:07:37,689 --> 05:07:39,689
I'm doing i'm gonna be able to do it that way

1287
05:07:40,009 --> 05:07:45,689
But um, he just sometimes decides that he's going to jump over and across instead of just grab

1288
05:07:46,090 --> 05:07:50,569
He just sometimes is like maria's like, you know, I feel like pole vaulting over whatever thing you're is in front of me

1289
05:07:50,810 --> 05:08:19,240
I'm just gonna jump the fuck over it. Yeah, you'll be reading about me

1290
05:08:42,860 --> 05:08:44,479
I will say though

1291
05:08:44,479 --> 05:08:48,729
They were so scared to have this game be just the cleaning game

1292
05:08:50,360 --> 05:08:51,799
They were like, oh my god

1293
05:08:51,799 --> 05:08:55,959
No, we have to get rid of that thing and they have to do shit like this for like at least 20 levels

1294
05:09:40,799 --> 05:09:59,520
Get over them barrio you motherfucker open up your fucking books and get the video game history streamers

1295
05:10:02,110 --> 05:10:05,869
I want I want you to open up the fucking book and I want you to see next to next to germa 985

1296
05:10:05,869 --> 05:10:07,869
I want you to look at accomplishments

1297
05:10:07,869 --> 05:10:10,360
And I'd like you to fucking open up this page

1298
05:10:30,490 --> 05:10:31,930
You want us to laugh?

1299
05:10:31,930 --> 05:10:48,299
There's no achievement center in there. It's like two. All right, get up. What's this guy's problem?

1300
05:10:56,439 --> 05:10:58,680
What was the goal with this level?

1301
05:11:00,810 --> 05:11:02,409
Just to get this

1302
05:11:02,409 --> 05:11:03,529
Is that it?

1303
05:11:03,529 --> 05:11:24,990
Now anytime you watch a streamer play this game and they get to this part and they go holy shit

1304
05:11:25,470 --> 05:11:27,470
Um, this I hate this

1305
05:11:27,799 --> 05:11:33,560
Tell them to use the fucking germa 985 dive technique and they show them a youtube video jump clip of this

1306
05:11:34,360 --> 05:11:36,520
And they'll be like wow. Okay, that's so much easier

1307
05:11:55,529 --> 05:12:25,599
Oh my god, you're gonna link them to slap five times all right, what's next chain chomp's bath give him a bath

05:12:30,700 --> 05:12:39,069
All right. So where's the bath?

1310
05:12:39,069 --> 05:12:47,099
Hey, you've got another problem over here. This thing's bigger than all those pups put together when it's chained up

1311
05:12:47,099 --> 05:12:49,099
There's no problem. But of course

1312
05:12:49,099 --> 05:12:54,139
When that thing's loose, we're in a heap of trouble. Oh, yes that beast's owner always burnt hands. It's pitiful

1313
05:12:54,779 --> 05:13:01,020
So where we have to where let me get that first. Hold on

And it was goiki

1360
05:22:10,599 --> 05:22:16,360
Goiki thanks for the five thousand bits fifty bucks. Is it better to have pogged and lost or to not never have pogged at all?

1361
05:22:18,040 --> 05:22:23,849
um

1362
05:22:23,849 --> 05:22:25,930
That's better to have pogged and lost. Absolutely

1363
05:22:32,380 --> 05:22:34,540
Even as old folks are starting to get excited about this

1364
05:22:35,180 --> 05:22:39,979
Oh before I forget I am not the mayor if you're looking for him. He's probably by that yellow mushroom

1365
05:22:41,020 --> 05:22:43,580
All right, so I need a yellow. Uh, I don't know what if they are like a

1366
05:22:44,619 --> 05:23:02,029
Papaya, what is it?

1367
05:23:02,029 --> 05:23:07,840
Is that you know the mayor looking for a papaya?

1368
05:23:12,490 --> 05:23:14,169
those of you that are uh

1369
05:23:14,169 --> 05:23:20,650
Those of you that have been around the channel for a while, you know that papaya is a b uh c tier

1370
05:23:21,549 --> 05:23:23,069
fruit according to me

1371
05:23:23,069 --> 05:23:26,439
Mom, it feels like it's getting close to fluff festival time

1372
05:23:27,479 --> 05:23:42,119
With papaya, where is it?

1373
05:23:43,720 --> 05:23:45,319
Your c tier

1374
05:23:45,319 --> 05:23:48,729
Yeah

1375
05:23:48,729 --> 05:23:55,099
You think so?

1376
05:23:55,099 --> 05:23:56,639
I'll have you know

1377
05:23:56,639 --> 05:23:58,639
That I have i'm a b plus

1378
05:23:58,959 --> 05:24:01,259
it's according to all the

1379
05:24:01,580 --> 05:24:03,580
data collection places

1380
05:24:04,540 --> 05:24:06,540
stream stats

1381
05:24:07,069 --> 05:24:09,069
I I have a b plus

1382
05:24:09,389 --> 05:24:11,389
in for best streamer of the year

1383
05:24:15,709 --> 05:24:17,709
Did it go down to a b minus? It's still fine

1384
05:24:24,060 --> 05:24:34,169
Why did I do all that for?

1385
05:24:38,330 --> 05:24:42,650
I just love going to find one fruit to bring back to give the yoshi egg

1386
05:24:57,080 --> 05:25:09,119
Give me this fucking thing. You could be a plus if you streamed as bugleberry. I don't think that's true

1387
05:25:10,000 --> 05:25:19,130
Okay, so this is secret now

1388
05:25:19,610 --> 05:25:30,860
What is it? What am I looking for?

1389
05:25:30,860 --> 05:25:32,860
Something I shouldn't wear. What if I go with the yoshi? No

1390
05:25:34,009 --> 05:25:36,090
mushrooms

1391
05:25:36,090 --> 05:25:37,849
All right. Okay. So

1392
05:25:37,849 --> 05:25:43,049
I gotta go down does it matter probably go down the hole that yeah, i'm gonna go down the hole that I went down before

1393
05:25:44,240 --> 05:25:56,720
This one, right?

1394
05:25:56,720 --> 05:26:14,349
Uh, okay

1395
05:26:14,349 --> 05:26:16,750
This music is kind of really loud

1396
05:26:17,470 --> 05:26:28,840
It's just playing the same loop over and over again

1397
05:26:29,560 --> 05:26:57,790
I found it

1398
05:26:57,790 --> 05:27:00,330
Yoshi, are you all right?

1399
05:27:00,330 --> 05:27:20,299
Yoshi

1400
05:27:20,299 --> 05:27:23,919
Oh, uh

1401
05:27:23,919 --> 05:27:35,000
I I didn't know what the fuck that was another one of these goddamn things. I'm gonna

1402
05:27:35,400 --> 05:27:39,000
Oh, that's gonna be look at how look at how much there is

1403
05:27:39,880 --> 05:27:44,409
Why are there people here?

1404
05:27:44,889 --> 05:27:47,450
I'm a chuckster

1405
05:27:47,450 --> 05:27:52,330
You better be careful when speaking to powerful the yontas some will chuck you straight up

1406
05:27:52,330 --> 05:27:57,290
But most chuck you backwards when it comes to tossing folk. I'm well, i'm a chuckster

1407
05:27:58,009 --> 05:28:12,680
I'm a chuckster

1408
05:28:12,680 --> 05:28:14,439
I'm a chuckster

1409
05:28:14,439 --> 05:28:18,490
He almost threw me off

1410
05:28:18,490 --> 05:28:25,979
Rick, are you a chuckster?

1411
05:28:27,979 --> 05:28:29,180

I like this one. This one's great. This one's this one sucks, but it's I like it

1414
05:29:12,619 --> 05:29:23,680
Wait, can I push them? Hey, throw me over this way

1415
05:29:39,259 --> 05:29:44,240
Um, I don't think how how could you get less accurate than what I just did?

1416
05:29:45,759 --> 05:29:53,560
I think I can influence a little bit

1417
05:29:57,080 --> 05:29:58,439
a little

1418
05:29:58,439 --> 05:30:16,279
Throw me no. No, no. No, can I back up back up? I came out of it at a weird angle

1419
05:30:16,840 --> 05:30:32,490
Hear me. It's a school night. I don't go to school

1420
05:30:45,610 --> 05:30:49,950
Come on, throw me more throw me more further further

1421
05:30:50,909 --> 05:30:53,930
Why are you not hitting this?

1422
05:30:53,930 --> 05:30:55,930
truancy, yeah

1423
05:30:56,409 --> 05:30:59,209
Somebody somebody tell the time to get the truancy on me

1424
05:31:00,169 --> 05:31:02,169
I I haven't been to a class

1425
05:31:02,490 --> 05:31:24,830
In 17 years somebody called the truancy on me. No you because look at the there's a wall there

1426
05:31:24,830 --> 05:31:54,139
Here far I bounced off the rip. Oh my god, whatever

1427
05:31:55,099 --> 05:31:57,099
Thankfully, I can stay here forever

1428
05:31:57,500 --> 05:31:59,500
actually forever and by the way

1429
05:32:00,159 --> 05:32:02,189
Can I just?

1430
05:32:02,189 --> 05:32:14,459
Nope

1431
05:32:23,369 --> 05:32:25,369
Throw me throw me real far

1432
05:32:30,169 --> 05:32:33,880
And go

1433
05:32:33,880 --> 05:32:38,240
Good. I need you all the way. Okay, you now have to be

1434
05:32:39,880 --> 05:32:42,279
I need you all the way in front of me here and I gotta get this right

1435
05:32:44,860 --> 05:32:49,659
Right there is all right. No, it's not good enough. That's good. It's okay. I think so

1436
05:32:51,580 --> 05:32:58,400
higher higher

1437
05:32:58,400 --> 05:33:02,639
He almost threw me to the all right you guys any of you guys ever played little league?

1438
05:33:04,119 --> 05:33:08,360
I used to play little league and we had these there was like two or three fields that were right next to each other

1439
05:33:09,150 --> 05:33:15,549
You'd have the one outfield would be there would be another outfield. It'd be two or three of them right next to each other, right?

1440
05:33:16,349 --> 05:33:18,349
And there was always that kid

1441
05:33:18,830 --> 05:33:21,150
That hit a home run every other at bat

1442
05:33:22,220 --> 05:33:26,860
And sometimes he would hit it over the fence and it would go into the other field

1443
05:33:27,419 --> 05:33:29,880
Even while they were playing a game

1444
05:33:29,880 --> 05:33:35,080
They would do it all it would happen all the fucking time. It would fuck up so many plays because like the big strong

1445
05:33:35,639 --> 05:33:37,310
eighth grader

1446
05:33:37,310 --> 05:33:40,349
Could hit the ball almost to the pitcher's mound on the other field

1447
05:33:43,549 --> 05:33:45,549
That's just so so dangerous

1448
05:34:11,529 --> 05:34:15,709
Now i've sealed my fate, I don't care if we're here all night i'm all right with this

1449
05:34:19,869 --> 05:34:30,349
I don't have a problem with this

1450
05:34:30,349 --> 05:34:32,720
Okay. Now this guy throws

1451
05:34:33,040 --> 05:34:36,560
So hard he throws

1452
05:34:37,200 --> 05:34:39,200
As hard as he can so I have to hold back

1453
05:34:39,680 --> 05:34:43,959
Say good night to me. Good night

1454
05:34:51,360 --> 05:34:58,220
Okay, so now i'm

1455
05:34:58,220 --> 05:35:00,909
Wait, i'm not up there

1456
05:35:11,290 --> 05:35:16,090
Okay, so

1457
05:35:16,090 --> 05:35:19,529
Twist am I going through a fucking portal? What's going? I hope throw me

1458
05:35:20,569 --> 05:35:28,509
Okay, there we go. So when I watch what about these guys?

1459
05:35:31,319 --> 05:35:36,400
Why I don't I don't get this. Why are they all here? Why are you all here? I don't get it. Why are they here?

1460
05:35:38,250 --> 05:35:40,650
Wait, is this just a mess? Just just a mess with you. I get it

1461
05:35:41,209 --> 05:35:55,900
throw

1462
05:35:55,900 --> 05:36:00,000
Um somebody over there

1463
05:36:02,810 --> 05:36:03,849
you

1464
05:36:03,849 --> 05:36:05,529
Which way did you throw?

1465
05:36:05,529 --> 05:36:12,540
Which way is this person's throw?

1466
05:36:12,540 --> 05:36:14,860
Do you definitely throw over there? Right? Is that a

1467
05:36:15,580 --> 05:36:39,880
It's gonna be right on the line right here. All right, come here. That's lined up. I think

1468
05:36:57,919 --> 05:37:00,959
It's gonna be on the other side. Yeah on the other side

1469
05:37:02,459 --> 05:37:18,169
What are you doing? I I don't I don't know I was overthinking that just throw me

1470
05:37:24,669 --> 05:37:27,069
I thought he I had to get thrown to the other side and then

1471
05:37:36,880 --> 05:37:39,689
Paws sick

1472
05:37:41,020 --> 05:37:48,180
Paws me that way, please. Well, he's a chuckster. Yeah, he is a chuckster

1473
05:38:10,159 --> 05:38:17,959
What happened

1474
05:38:33,069 --> 05:38:37,369
He threw you to your death. Ah, I need to get I don't miss this

1475
05:38:51,119 --> 05:38:51,759
Don't rush it

1476
05:38:51,759 --> 05:38:53,759
If I rush it i'm gonna throw off the edge

1477
05:38:53,759 --> 05:39:06,009
The problem I have with that one when he throws your way up high is if I hold back too much

1478
05:39:06,169 --> 05:39:09,770
Then I just go right back down. But if I don't hold it at all or I do it too little

1479
05:39:11,099 --> 05:39:13,099
You really fly

1480
05:39:13,500 --> 05:39:39,229
Come on

1481
05:39:42,590 --> 05:39:44,590
You can control yourself in the air

1482
05:39:44,909 --> 05:39:45,869
I know

1483
05:39:45,869 --> 05:39:49,389
But if I hold if I do back too much, it's it's a really

1484
05:39:50,270 --> 05:39:53,470
There it's a lot of finessing in the air when you can't really see where you are

1485
05:40:09,080 --> 05:40:13,400
Hold forward. I will go over the cross. I will go across the whole map if I hold forward

1486
05:40:15,000 --> 05:40:22,250
And what is this doing this for? Well, has he tilted I was facing straight ahead

1487
05:40:42,319 --> 05:40:45,279
Game sucks streamers sucks. I'm going to bed

1488
05:40:46,959 --> 05:40:49,580
Wait, it can't be both. Okay

1489
05:40:50,060 --> 05:41:13,290
You gotta pick one. You gotta pick one and stick with it. Um

1490
05:41:23,580 --> 05:41:26,270
What why

1491
05:41:29,069 --> 05:41:32,349
Okay, I did this like six times in a row doing the same thing

1492
05:41:36,000 --> 05:41:38,880
And now all of a sudden it's not I did i'm god. I got it wrong

1493
05:41:57,439 --> 05:42:01,340
This I can't get like more straight than this

1494
05:42:07,000 --> 05:42:45,500
But i'm not gonna do it again. I didn't holy shit. That was close. All right, just do it quickly quickly go go go go right here

1495
05:42:48,270 --> 05:43:12,110
Okay, here we go. This is it. I can't tell i'm not ready yet. I'm not ready for this not yet

1496
05:43:13,290 --> 05:43:16,650
I'm not ready for this. Is that no, that's not right. I got a little bit more to the left

1497
05:43:21,150 --> 05:43:41,840
right there

1498
05:43:41,840 --> 05:43:50,810
Line's gonna be right between my legs. I love having a big fucking rectangle in the way

1499
05:43:51,369 --> 05:44:24,830
It was as if I was standing like at a full like 40 to 50 degrees to my right

1500
05:44:31,389 --> 05:44:34,990
I saw I I saw good do it now good now. I agree with you

1501
05:44:36,590 --> 05:44:38,590
I wasn't

1502
05:44:38,909 --> 05:44:45,389
What the fuck there's so many there's only so many pixels that mario's body can turn

1503
05:44:46,110 --> 05:44:54,060
You know what I mean? Like it there's only so much he can finite movements he can make

1504
05:44:54,779 --> 05:45:10,439
There's a whatever. There you go

1505
05:45:12,459 --> 05:45:14,459
These things these things are getting fucking deleted

1506
05:45:15,180 --> 05:45:30,139
On sunday, by the way, you're never gonna see one ever again. This has got me so paranoid that it's not correct

1507
05:46:07,799 --> 05:46:14,590
What the fuck wait, what what the fuck oh my god

1508
05:46:25,740 --> 05:46:28,110
The angle's bad

1509
05:46:29,869 --> 05:46:45,360
It's too far back

1510
05:46:46,360 --> 05:46:57,180
Didn't I go over it

1511
05:46:57,180 --> 05:47:00,959
Where did I fall then?

1512
05:47:01,200 --> 05:47:18,090
I undershot it

1513
05:47:18,090 --> 05:48:05,930
Right. He's gonna push me though if I uh, oh

1514
05:48:06,569 --> 05:48:14,729
All right, let's go

1515
05:48:14,729 --> 05:48:16,009
Fuck you

1516
05:48:16,009 --> 05:48:58,009
I can't tell this is too. No, that's that's too far to the left to the right. Just go straight

1517
05:48:58,490 --> 05:49:09,950
What do you think i'm doing? Is that it?

1518
05:49:24,799 --> 05:49:40,240
I mean, I can't get it any better than this. I don't think can I ground pound out of this a line?

1519
05:49:40,479 --> 05:49:56,000
Yeah, that's I tried last time. How's that? I think it's a little too much too much to the right. That's perfect

1520
05:49:56,479 --> 05:50:11,639
I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It's good. Go do it. I'm gonna do it

1521
05:50:11,799 --> 05:50:24,729
If I get thrown 500 feet to the right and this whole thing is stupid wake up mario

1522
05:50:25,049 --> 05:50:38,639
Is the angle between your camera and his camera?

1523
05:50:40,220 --> 05:50:42,220
Who else has a fucking camera?

1524
05:50:54,200 --> 05:50:57,240
Yeah, I I had to actually wake his ass up. You're kidding me

1525
05:50:58,040 --> 05:51:40,520
What do you think we think we're good? I can't tell the chuxters position is more important than yours

1526
05:51:41,159 --> 05:51:47,419
Okay, here we go

1527
05:51:47,419 --> 05:51:55,529
Close enough

1528
05:51:55,529 --> 05:51:58,970
What the fuck man? This shouldn't be this ridiculous

1529
05:51:59,529 --> 05:52:01,529
Just do it. What the fuck?

1530
05:52:23,560 --> 05:52:25,560
He's gonna walk into me, isn't he?

1531
05:52:39,930 --> 05:53:00,029
God damn it. That's not he's not in the right spot. He's not he's got to turn. I think that's it

1532
05:53:01,979 --> 05:53:38,000
Jeremy did you join? I did it. Holy fuck. That was horrible. Is that it?

1533
05:53:38,479 --> 05:53:59,439
Yata's in need remember you are not a chuxter. That's fine. That doesn't bother me

1534
05:54:01,200 --> 05:54:06,409
I just went away for a bit and now look I can't believe it another fine mess and it's all a doozy

1535
05:54:06,490 --> 05:54:10,250
Some of the villagers are trapped in that burning ooze to go save them 10 people three minutes

1536
05:54:11,369 --> 05:54:14,000

1537

Another will there be is there another stream?

06:06:59,520 --> 06:07:02,330
Two to three hours. Okay

1622
06:07:02,970 --> 06:07:04,970
Unless you want to 100 percent

1623
06:07:05,049 --> 06:07:07,979
Depends on how many you do

1624
06:07:07,979 --> 06:07:29,069
Two to four hours. Okay, depends on how much you choke. Well, that's cool. I can

1625
06:07:31,500 --> 06:07:33,479
Well, hi

1626
06:07:33,479 --> 06:07:34,860

You could finish this in an hour if you wanted to

1629
06:07:41,290 --> 06:07:43,290
I'm i'm not sure I want to rush through it

1630
06:07:45,240 --> 06:07:48,360
I don't I don't think I just want to what do I have 58 60?

1631
06:07:49,419 --> 06:07:51,020
I'm not sure. I want to just

06:07:51,020 --> 06:07:53,020
Finish it quickly hurry up and be done

1633
06:07:55,759 --> 06:07:58,240
I'd like to try to at least get another

1634
06:08:00,189 --> 06:08:02,189
like 10 to 15 stars

1635
06:08:03,450 --> 06:08:05,450
At least get to like 70 80

A king gizzard and the wizard lizard. It's a really awesome band that you might enjoy

1697
06:13:39,080 --> 06:13:41,979
If you haven't you should check them out

1698
06:13:41,979 --> 06:13:49,099
It is a great album called in your mind to get introduced to them seeing a lot of pogs

1699

Espada escalada. Thanks for the 250 had the same exact bad facial hair pattern. I feel your pain

1703
06:14:09,560 --> 06:14:14,520
Yeah, but I love to have a decent beard or something. Maybe but i'm not sure it would even work on me

1704
06:14:15,319 --> 06:14:16,840
I've kind of got

1705
06:14:16,840 --> 06:14:28,840
I'm not sure it would a big lot of facial hair would work. I like the way that I can make my face look now

1706
06:14:32,520 --> 06:14:37,069
So good, uh cell juniors. Thanks for the three dollars. I like this stream

1707
06:14:38,040 --> 06:14:42,490
I like that you like this stream. Thanks for the three bucks

1708
06:14:44,139 --> 06:14:47,900
Smelly boy. Thanks for the 250 after this. Are you willing to give paper mario a chance?

1709
06:14:49,479 --> 06:14:51,279
maybe

1710
06:14:51,279 --> 06:14:53,279
after mario sunshine though

1711
06:14:54,080 --> 06:14:57,560
I would like to

1712
06:14:57,560 --> 06:15:00,119
Get away from the game cube in the wii for a little while

1713
06:15:00,919 --> 06:15:02,919
And by a little while I mean a week or two

1714
06:15:03,639 --> 06:15:06,119
Just because we've done a lot of game cube and a lot of wii

1715
06:15:06,919 --> 06:15:13,599
The majority of the streams have been game cube or wii games for almost the last two weeks

1716
06:15:19,549 --> 06:15:22,029
We will come back to it. There's still tons of shit that I have

1717
06:15:24,349 --> 06:15:28,720
We'll see what's wrong with that. No, nothing wrong with that

1718
06:15:29,599 --> 06:15:33,439
I just like to I like to mix it up a little bit

1719
06:15:38,240 --> 06:15:40,240
If mario paper mario is long

1720
06:15:40,639 --> 06:15:43,819
That's fine. I'm i'm

1721
06:15:43,819 --> 06:15:47,819
The streams of yesteryear are not the streams of today year

1722
06:15:50,139 --> 06:15:51,259
obviously

1723
06:15:51,259 --> 06:15:55,659
Uh me streaming mario sunshine three days in a row four days in a row

1724
06:15:57,049 --> 06:16:00,090
Is something I probably never would have done a few years ago

1725
06:16:01,630 --> 06:16:03,630
I never used to play the same game

1726
06:16:04,669 --> 06:16:09,310
More than one or two streams. I would just abandon it because I just didn't think people would stay interested

1727
06:16:10,200 --> 06:16:12,200
And I don't think I would stay interested

1728
06:16:14,409 --> 06:16:16,490
so i'm

1729
06:16:16,490 --> 06:16:18,169
it's not like

1730
06:16:18,169 --> 06:16:22,520
It's not a big deal

1731
06:16:22,520 --> 06:16:26,919
Sorcery sorcery was a different case because sorcery was it's one of my favorite things ever

1732
06:16:27,560 --> 06:16:40,770
Streaming sorcery 10 to 12 times and that's just one of my favorite experiences

1733
06:16:48,189 --> 06:16:53,479
Yeah, but I never write off any game. I never say that i'm not going to do something. So

1734
06:16:54,599 --> 06:16:57,020
There's definitely a chance

1735
06:16:57,020 --> 06:17:03,099
CDT thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars jerma. I've been a fan since 2012 and I watched your pyromaniac video specifically

1736
06:17:03,900 --> 06:17:05,180
a long time

1737
06:17:05,180 --> 06:17:09,259
I'm turning 22 today and I want to thank you for being one of the positive influences in my life

1738
06:17:11,799 --> 06:17:13,880
It's a very long time that I forget that a lot

1739
06:17:15,790 --> 06:17:18,919
That next year

1740
06:17:19,720 --> 06:17:20,680
is

1741
06:17:20,680 --> 06:17:22,520
10 straight years

1742
06:17:22,520 --> 06:17:26,569
Doing this

1743
06:17:26,569 --> 06:17:28,729
2021 will be 10 full years

1744
06:17:30,159 --> 06:17:32,159
Doing either youtube or twitch

1745
06:17:33,200 --> 06:17:35,439
without stopping

1746
06:17:35,439 --> 06:17:40,560
There's been a couple of times when I haven't been around for a couple weeks two or three weeks is the maximum

1747
06:17:40,799 --> 06:17:42,799
I think i've ever not been around

1748
06:17:42,959 --> 06:17:46,400
But i've been around at least every week or two

1749
06:17:47,119 --> 06:17:48,319
10 years

1750
06:17:48,319 --> 06:17:50,319
That's crazy to think about that

1751
06:17:57,610 --> 06:18:14,299
Oh, there absolutely will be an anniversary stream and I knew you from the servers. See somebody's here that knows me from the servers

1752

Toadside picnic. Thanks for the 300 bits jerma fellow mass hole here

1756
06:18:34,799 --> 06:18:41,880
Do you miss the chaotic yet inexpensive atmosphere that is market basket? I do miss something very specific from market basket

1757
06:18:42,599 --> 06:18:45,880
Market basket had uh, probably the best

1758
06:18:46,840 --> 06:18:51,799
Ginger ginger ale they had a golden ginger ale. It was market basket golden ginger ale brand

1759
06:18:52,599 --> 06:18:55,799
It's probably the best ginger ale i've had nothing can really replace it

1760
06:18:56,659 --> 06:19:04,319
unfortunate

1761
06:19:04,319 --> 06:19:06,729
You know, you know

1762
06:19:06,729 --> 06:19:09,209
I could probably order it somehow but it'd be weird

1763
06:19:10,009 --> 06:19:18,319
It'd be weird. But yeah, I I used to I did get stuff from there

1764
06:19:21,740 --> 06:19:27,130
Thanks to the 300 bits

1765
06:19:27,130 --> 06:19:29,049

We can switch this don't you love how I haven't had this highest tip bit leader top sub thing to work

1768
06:19:38,509 --> 06:19:40,509
I've never got it to work once

1769
06:19:40,509 --> 06:19:47,470
People just are waiting for that to happen. This never happened once. There's just no one. No one's getting there's no top sub gifter ever

1770
06:19:50,569 --> 06:19:56,619
Like am I ever gonna get this fixed it kind of worked the first week. Yeah, and then just stopped

1771
06:19:59,630 --> 06:20:04,029
Well, it's those people in the chairs. That's what you don't understand. It's always that guy in the chair

1772
06:20:04,110 --> 06:20:06,110
It's always the slug and it's always the

1773
06:20:06,669 --> 06:20:11,630
Animorph someday we'll know

1774
06:20:12,650 --> 06:20:15,290
Someday we will know

1775
06:20:15,290 --> 06:20:16,669
We will

1776
06:20:16,669 --> 06:20:18,669
That day is not today. Unfortunately

1777
06:20:24,200 --> 06:20:26,200
Anyways, as always thanks again guys

1778
06:20:28,799 --> 06:20:30,799
We'll hopefully see you tomorrow

1779
06:20:30,799 --> 06:20:32,240
for the

1780
06:20:32,240 --> 06:20:35,919
Holy shit. That's a lot of people for the conclusion of mario sunshine

1781
06:20:37,080 --> 06:20:42,639
However long that takes

1782
06:20:42,639 --> 06:20:43,840
That's fast

1783
06:20:43,840 --> 06:20:52,799
There are three or four more bits to do

1784
06:20:53,369 --> 06:20:54,330
as these

1785
06:20:54,330 --> 06:20:57,049
Insane credits roll out from the hundreds of gifted subs

1786
06:20:57,770 --> 06:20:59,770
And hundreds of regular subs

1787
06:20:59,930 --> 06:21:07,919
It's not just the gifted subs

1788
06:21:07,919 --> 06:21:13,159
Thanks guys never the new year's stream. That was ridiculous

1789
06:21:14,139 --> 06:21:18,220
I think that new year's stream. I think there were two to three thousand subs on that stream

1790
06:21:18,779 --> 06:21:27,680
That was out of control

1791
06:21:34,990 --> 06:21:36,990
He fucking loves us

1792
06:21:37,740 --> 06:21:39,340
Of course I do

1793
06:21:39,340 --> 06:21:43,930
What do you think this is?

1794
06:21:43,930 --> 06:21:47,130
Bulbaswag disney. Thanks for the 500 bits. This is one of my favorite childhood games

1795
06:21:47,209 --> 06:21:49,209
I'm, so happy you're finally jumping and diving

1796
06:21:49,529 --> 06:21:54,409
I've been spamming it every once in a while the movement mechanics is one of the best things about the game also spray water on

1797
06:21:54,409 --> 06:21:55,770
the birds

1798
06:21:55,770 --> 06:22:06,159
Again bulbaswag five more dolls here that one spot you found to get yoshi over there on that island is completely awful

1799
06:22:06,720 --> 06:22:08,720
If you want to cheese it here's a video

1800
06:22:08,880 --> 06:22:12,590
You can get yoshi out of bounds super easily into that island

1801
06:22:12,590 --> 06:22:17,310
But like it's not necessary or anything just a trick heads up from me your pal

1802
06:22:18,029 --> 06:22:23,919
Getting yoshi over there is awful

1803
06:22:23,919 --> 06:22:34,770
Maybe i'll give it a look use noclip on the emulator

1804
06:22:42,590 --> 06:22:47,069
Goosely charmed thanks to the 250 hey germa first time donator wanted to share something that happened at work

1805
06:22:48,139 --> 06:22:51,500
I was running late to a meeting and it was my turn to present

1806
06:22:52,299 --> 06:22:57,099
I airplayed my computer screen and some audio of a guy talking started playing

1807
06:22:57,740 --> 06:23:02,299
I was so confused for a few seconds until I realized I had paused a video of yours

1808
06:23:02,779 --> 06:23:07,919
And it had started auto playing all I can say is thank god you were being somewhat normal

1809
06:23:08,319 --> 06:23:10,720
And not crying to farting and screaming

1810
06:23:11,639 --> 06:23:14,200
Anyways, love the stream. Oh, man

1811
06:23:15,159 --> 06:23:21,599
what's the over under okay, if you took every single stream i've ever done and

1812
06:23:22,479 --> 06:23:31,119
Calculate how many hours that stream was all of them together and then rolled dice to see to pick a time spot

1813
06:23:32,700 --> 06:23:34,700
on that gigantic hundred

1814
06:23:35,639 --> 06:23:38,299
Two thousand five thousand plus hour video

1815
06:23:38,939 --> 06:23:43,979
What's the over under that it would be something fucking ridiculous or something fucked up that was happening on the stream?

1816
06:23:49,919 --> 06:23:58,419
Wouldn't be 100 70 if I was a psycho

1817
06:23:59,610 --> 06:24:05,560
Which I i'm not i'm not

1818
06:24:06,599 --> 06:24:08,750
Imagine if we did a coin

1819
06:24:08,750 --> 06:24:12,590
cost rng stream where it's every stream i've ever done

1820
06:24:14,880 --> 06:24:17,200
And every 10 minutes we pull the fucking lever

1821
06:24:18,299 --> 06:24:23,259
And it picks a random spot in like 2 000 hours of 4 000 hours of streaming

1822
06:24:23,979 --> 06:24:35,930
That would be kind of fun

1823
06:24:35,930 --> 06:24:43,340
Do that for the anniversary

1824
06:24:45,369 --> 06:24:47,369
That's a massive video file

1825
06:24:48,490 --> 06:24:50,490
I don't think that would be possible

1826
06:24:50,810 --> 06:24:54,169
Yeah, that would be a video file that was thousands of hours long

1827
06:24:55,130 --> 06:24:56,810
I don't think that's possible

1828
06:24:56,810 --> 06:25:08,240
I have a 50 terabyte but I would have to get an external hard drive. That was a petabyte or something

1829
06:25:08,880 --> 06:25:15,150
I'm gonna hold on to that because that's so dumb that it might be worth doing

1830
06:25:15,869 --> 06:25:22,279
Let up a generator that takes videos from the archive channel and gives you a random time stamp

1831
06:25:25,900 --> 06:25:28,439
Yeah, i'll look into this

1832
06:25:28,439 --> 06:25:30,439
I'm actually gonna for real look into this

1833
06:25:31,080 --> 06:25:44,889
Put all the streams in a playlist and roll the dice to choose a stream to do then roll again to choose the video

1834
06:25:45,849 --> 06:25:47,900
and time

1835
06:25:47,900 --> 06:25:49,900
It's possible. It's very possible

1836
06:25:50,459 --> 06:26:00,759
Yeah, i'm gonna do that. We'll do that

1837
06:26:00,759 --> 06:26:04,970
Put it on the list

1838
06:26:04,970 --> 06:26:06,970
anyways, we had um

1839
06:26:07,560 --> 06:26:10,540
30 30 dollars 3 000 bits from atlantius

1840
06:26:11,479 --> 06:26:14,619
Thanks for the 30 drop dude

1841
06:26:14,619 --> 06:26:20,119
I wanted to ask if you're planning on doing some kind of live in in-person show

1842
06:26:20,759 --> 06:26:23,880
I'll be willing to go to vegas and watch you perform in some way

1843
06:26:26,560 --> 06:26:30,909
It hasn't really come up

1844
06:26:30,909 --> 06:26:32,990
Something about that is very very funny to me

1845
06:26:33,869 --> 06:26:37,150
If I somehow got to rent out one of the theaters

1846
06:26:39,240 --> 06:26:41,000
On the strip or something

1847
06:26:41,000 --> 06:26:43,560
And for two nights only

1848
06:26:44,189 --> 06:26:46,909
I did just a terrible show

1849
06:26:47,549 --> 06:26:49,549
Like it was an hour or two long

1850
06:26:49,790 --> 06:26:56,759
That would be so bad

1851
06:26:57,099 --> 06:27:00,060
And make a fake almost infomercial esque

1852
06:27:01,880 --> 06:27:03,880
Commercial and trailer for it

1853
06:27:06,669 --> 06:27:10,750
And play that for a couple weeks before it happens and start selling tickets and stuff

1854
06:27:11,549 --> 06:27:20,650
Make the tickets two hundred dollars. Well, that would be a real asshole thing to do

1855
06:27:21,369 --> 06:27:24,889
Eclers in the crowd

1856
06:27:25,290 --> 06:27:35,740
Put a bunch of plants in to fake laugh at stuff and only see I only only sell 50 tickets and have

1857
06:27:36,060 --> 06:27:42,060
Hire a thousand people to come and crack the fuck up at everything and get cameras and film a live special

1858
06:27:48,889 --> 06:27:51,849
Have two people in the audience be actual real people

1859
06:27:52,569 --> 06:27:55,150
And the rest are just plants

1860
06:27:55,150 --> 06:27:56,509
Don't tell any of them

1861
06:27:56,509 --> 06:28:05,040
No, i'm gonna at that point. That's just an elaborate prank on two people

1862
06:28:07,630 --> 06:28:13,470
That's stupid

1863
06:28:13,470 --> 06:28:17,479
Now put it on the list

1864
06:28:17,479 --> 06:28:20,439
Thanks for the thirty dollars though, dude. Thank you going for the 500 bits

1865
06:28:20,439 --> 06:28:22,680
My favorite part of the stream is when you do bad at gaming

1866
06:28:23,770 --> 06:28:28,889
Hold on my favorite part of this stream is when you do a bad gaming moment and you just get mad at mario

1867
06:28:28,970 --> 06:28:30,970
Like why did mario just do that?

1868
06:28:35,319 --> 06:28:36,279
Why

1869
06:28:36,279 --> 06:28:40,439
There are some things that he like jumps over the pole and shit without me pressing anything

1870
06:28:40,439 --> 06:28:43,080
He does sometimes he does things without me doing anything

1871
06:28:43,639 --> 06:28:52,479
Mario is trying his best

1872
06:28:54,400 --> 06:28:56,400
And who is controlling him?

1873
06:28:56,799 --> 06:29:02,319
I am directing him but he is in control. I am directing him with an analog stick

1874
06:29:02,799 --> 06:29:08,830
But he has to run

1875
06:29:08,830 --> 06:29:10,830
If you put an earpiece in my ear

1876
06:29:11,319 --> 06:29:13,150
and said up

1877
06:29:13,150 --> 06:29:16,110
Right down up up if you just I would I would run up

1878
06:29:16,830 --> 06:29:18,830
But I still have to run it's my legs

1879
06:29:27,610 --> 06:29:29,610
Is he here right now?

1880
06:29:41,119 --> 06:29:43,119
Like i'm on one of those tv shows

1881
06:29:43,840 --> 06:29:46,080
Or i'm telling you there's a ghost that lives in my house

1882
06:29:47,880 --> 06:29:49,880
And I start going oh

1883
06:29:50,270 --> 06:29:52,159
Jeremy

1884
06:29:52,159 --> 06:29:54,159
Is he in the room right now?

1885
06:29:55,099 --> 06:29:58,110
Yeah. Yep. Explain it to me

1886
06:30:04,569 --> 06:30:07,450
Hey blackout. Thanks for the thousand bits and that's our final

1887
06:30:08,169 --> 06:30:09,369
Hit of the night

1888
06:30:09,369 --> 06:30:11,000
Move over here

1889
06:30:11,000 --> 06:30:20,569
Thanks for watching everybody

1890
06:30:20,569 --> 06:30:27,439
Uh blackout says for ten dollars thousand bits. Thank you blackout. Jeremy listen to your stream at work

1891
06:30:28,159 --> 06:30:33,529
Uh, I work at party city and today you made me laugh while talking to a customer

1892
06:30:34,169 --> 06:30:38,250
I had to yank out my earbuds stop laughing. She must have thought I was insane

1893
06:30:38,889 --> 06:30:39,930
Thanks for the content, man

1894
06:30:39,930 --> 06:30:45,290
I know you say we shouldn't feel obligated to donate but i've used your stream to make my workdays far better too much

1895
06:30:46,009 --> 06:30:54,220
to not donate keep it up for riffing your earbuds out

1896
06:30:57,869 --> 06:30:59,869
Yeah, you just be like i'm watching uh

1897
06:31:00,669 --> 06:31:05,310
I'm watching tv or something. Well, you can't you won't be that doesn't make any sense. You listen to a funny podcast

1898
06:31:11,520 --> 06:31:13,520
I appreciate that though. Thank you. I

1899
06:31:14,459 --> 06:31:17,580
No one's ever obligated to give this channel money. Some people give a lot

1900
06:31:18,650 --> 06:31:22,409
Some people give some some people don't give anything at all and all that is completely fine

1901
06:31:23,049 --> 06:31:25,549
That's all perfectly fine. All of it

1902
06:31:29,680 --> 06:31:35,200
Don't feel obligated to give a cent to this channel if you do i've really fucking appreciate it if you don't thanks for being here

1903
06:31:35,439 --> 06:31:37,520
Thanks for watching

1904
06:31:37,520 --> 06:31:41,790
You contribute as well

1905
06:31:41,790 --> 06:31:46,830
If a thousand of you guys two thousand three thousand of you are not subbed to the channel, but you watch the stream

1906
06:31:47,709 --> 06:31:49,709
That does it benefits the stream?

1907
06:31:50,330 --> 06:31:51,630
immensely

1908
06:31:51,630 --> 06:32:05,040
I will never give you money and you should you that's that's totally fine

1909
06:32:05,680 --> 06:32:07,680
Don't worry about that. You don't have to ever

1910
06:32:17,340 --> 06:32:19,580
When will we know if germy's in financial trouble?

1911
06:32:20,939 --> 06:32:24,139
If I do a raid shadow legends ad on my stream

1912
06:32:25,180 --> 06:32:27,439
That's when you know

1913
06:32:27,439 --> 06:32:29,119
Something's wrong

1914
06:32:39,040 --> 06:32:41,520
Can I watch this stream while i'm nude? Yeah, go for it

1915
06:32:50,750 --> 06:32:52,860
See you guys tomorrow

1916
06:32:52,860 --> 06:32:56,540
Have a fantastic rest of your night. Thanks for watching mario sunshine. We're gonna finish it tomorrow

1917
06:32:57,279 --> 06:32:58,400
Good night

1918
06:32:58,400 --> 06:33:01,069
Bye. Take care. See you soon
