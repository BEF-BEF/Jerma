1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,500
Are you sure you don't want to join Berg?

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,960
Wait, what are we offering? What is my deal?

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,960
For every video that you upload with the clan tag Berg,

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
the Berg CEO of Berg Industries gives you $5,000.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,339
$5,000?

6
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,339
Now, we're talking about the CEO of Berg Associates.

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,340
This is one of the biggest corporations in the world.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
Yeah, I can clearly tell that this is serious stuff.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,340
But...

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,340
But you have to give me time. I have to talk this over with my agent.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,340
Well, in each upload, I forgot to mention this is part of the stipulation,

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,340
in each upload you have to be completely naked.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,340
And there has to be a face cam on you.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,340
Like on your naked butt.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm totally fine with that.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,479
Even if it got flagged and you got removed?

17
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,479
No, but I mean, can I do the uploads on livejasmine.com? Is that okay?

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,540
No, it has to be on YouTube.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,540
And you can make like separate accounts.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Yeah, I guess I'll have to do that.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,780
Dude, you'd get arrested.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,340
Somebody actually has.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,340
No, already.

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,340
Somebody actually has the McDonald's logo.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,340
I don't find that hilarious.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,340
No!

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
It's been too long since I've played this game.

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,340
He is going big. Going ham.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,579
I'm in the middle, guys.

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,579
I keep forgetting that left click is not like melee.

31
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,579
I keep trying to left click and I throw a friggin' blade at the wall.

32
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,650
How does that make you feel?

33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,650
You're getting excited now, but you're going to...

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,650
I am getting very excited.

35
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,650
Oh, I missed him!

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Oh, you didn't even throw it.

37
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,650
On my screen I did.

38
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,650
No, not on my screen.

39
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,650
I was holding it for really long.

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,650
Sweden ping, bro.

41
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,650
Okay, so now the ping game starts.

42
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,650
Yeah, it's like, dude, come on. My ping sucks, dude.

43
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,650
My controller's broken.

44
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,650
Totally, dude.

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,650
My A button on my controller doesn't work.

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,949
Like, I don't know.

47
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,949
My controller's like broken.

48
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,949
That's the oldest excuse in the book.

49
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:21,409
You actually invented that excuse.

50
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,409
Back in the day.

51
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,409
Oh, hey, dude.

52
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,409
Oh, I thought you backed me.

53
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,409
I thought you backed me first.

54
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,409
You're shit.

55
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:36,840
It's so back, too, because I'm doing the climb maneuver.

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
So I can't do anything.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,849
Okay, meet me, listen.

58
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,849
Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?

59
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,849
I don't know where the statue is that will play this game.

60
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,849
Oh, wait, I'm going to bank.

61
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,849
What was that? You were going to bank what?

62
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,849
What were you going to do? You were going to bank me?

63
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,849
Okay, I'm coming for you.

64
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,849
Oh, there we go.

65
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,789
Okay, now meet me at the statue.

66
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,789
Meet me at the statue.

67
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,789
I'm at the statue.

68
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,789
You said meet me at the statue.

69
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,789
You didn't say I'm going to kill you at the statue.

70
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,789
I'm like, just stand here.

71
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,789
Okay, I'm on the statue.

72
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,789
That means we're going to hang out,

73
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,379
not you're going to throw a knife at my head.

74
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,379
All right, where are you?

75
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,379
Look at that kill cam.

76
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,810
What did I just do to you?

77
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,810
I came to the statue.

78
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,810
I'm still trying to be your friend.

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,430
What are you doing?

80
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,430
You're the best opponent ever.

81
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,430
Now you see, when you break the friendship trust,

82
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,430
meet at the statue queue,

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,430
now you're getting bankrupted.

84
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,430
It's going to happen in this game.

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,430
I thought we were going to be weird.

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,430
All right, you know what?

87
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,080
Watch this.

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Is there another guy right here?

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Oh, it's you.

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Oh, you slag.

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Somebody was behind you too.

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
All right, boo, we're going to have to kill him.

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,770
Well, once again, Orb is going to lead here

94
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,770
with quite a solid 125 points.

95
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,770
It looks like another victory here for Orb.

96
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,770
He is going to try and not really play it cool

97
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,770
because he doesn't really...

98
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,770
Oh, only Orb will shell cast his own live gameplay

99
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,769
about how good he is.

100
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,769
Oh, shit, very shortly.

101
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,769
Boo, are you ready for this one?

102
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,769
Oh, that wasn't even him.

103
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,769
Now I'm ready.

104
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,769
I'm going to slap you with my axe.

105
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,769
No, I'm sorry, boo.

106
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,769
What?

107
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,769
I thought it was him.

108
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,769
Okay, come to the statue now.

109
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,769
It's not.

110
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,769
Hey, boo, don't shoot me.

111
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,899
Don't shoot me, I didn't mean to.

112
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,899
Come here, guys.

113
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,139
I'm by the statue, guys. Where are you guys?

114
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,139
Me and boo have a mission right now

115
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,139
to come destroy you.

116
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,139
You're really pre-aiming me?

117
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,139
Really?

118
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,139
Okay, I see how it is.

119
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,139
I see how we're going to play this.

120
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,329
Oh, shit.

121
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,329
No, no, no.

122
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,329
I don't have anything. Where is he?

123
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,189
No, no.

124
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,189
Behind you, what are you doing?

125
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,189
I don't know where he is.

126
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,189
I was behind you for the longest time.

127
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,189
I missed everything.

128
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,189
Hey, well, that shows.

129
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,189
Well, 145 points, guys.

130
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,189
I'm going to put this hatchet up your asshole.

131
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,189
I believe we have another W

132
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,189
in the vicinity of this game.

133
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,189
Jerma, we got 40 seconds.

134
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,189
Please make him count.

135
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,189
I'm not even throwing, I'm trying to find him.

136
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,189
Okay, so we've come to that part of the game again

137
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,189
where I like to talk.

138
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,189
Where is he?

139
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,189
145 points on the scoreboard here

140
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,189
and we're going to play another victory here

141
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,189
for Orb. He's been playing consistently

142
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,189
throughout this tournament

143
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,189
and he is going to

144
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,189
you know, not really try

145
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,189
because it's already 10 seconds.

146
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,189
It's got to be a victory here.

147
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,189
He's going to walk around and try to

148
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,189
let the opponent back him here.

149
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,189
No, my Jesus!

150
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,189
Oh, yes, you got him.

151
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,189
What an evil guy.

152
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,189
Listen, I don't believe

153
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,189
it lagged.

154
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,189
Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:13,189
Dude, I played like shit in this game

156
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,189
and I got second place.

157
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,189
Nice host.

158
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,189
I lag, guys.

159
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,189
I got banged right here.

160
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,189
Are you going to DDoS

161
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,189
me right now, guys?

162
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,189
Are you that amped to win?

163
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,189
Are you going to DDoS me?

164
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,189
See you guys.

165
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,189
I think I went right at the end and then I got

166
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,189
bankrupt with one second left.

167
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,189
Jerma, what happened to Orb?

168
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,189
Don't you remember all the times we met

169
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,189
at the statue?

170
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,189
Yeah, I remember meet me at the statue so I can punch you in the face.

171
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,189
That's like what happened.

172
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,189
Meet me at the flagpole after school.

173
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,189
I'm going to put like an icicle up your ass.
