1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:21,460
I've been training all day. I don't know how to get clothes though.

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,829
You have no Drip? You have no Roblox Drip?

3
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,829
He's got the default character face.

4
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,579
I don't have any V-Bucks.

5
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,579
Get some V-Bucks, or Robux.

6
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
Why would I give Roblox money?

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,579
Because they're-

8
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,579
Just so they can enslave our youth.

9
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,039
True.

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,039
Give me one second. I've got a whole fucking thing behind me. Hold on.

11
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,070
Give me like two minutes.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,700
Hi everybody. Welcome to the stream.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,520
It's a very special stream today.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,010
Because today, today is somebody's birthday.

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,010
I don't know whose birthday it is, but it's probably yours.

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,670
I made a promise a week ago.

17
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,939
And we're gonna do it.

18
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,939
So we got a couple people here.

19
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,109
We got Oak and Ster.

20
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:36,819
Oak is going to guide Ster and I through the world of Roblox.

21
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,060
Because that's exactly what we're playing.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,879
So I'm just gonna show this because this is kind of a pain in the ass setup, but whatever.

23
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
Oh, let me ask this question.

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,879
Hey, before I show everybody the screen, does it matter if they can see my username?

25
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:04,500
I mean, they're gonna see it anyways, right?

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,389
Yeah, it does.

27
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,759
Ain't a lot of nos and yeses.

28
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,759
I was muted. Oops.

29
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,759
You want to go to your profile and go to security or privacy?

30
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,759
And make it so only friends can join you.

31
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,759
Okay, cool. Yeah, I think I already have that setup.

32
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,759
Alright, cool.

33
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:35,080
Cool, cool. Alright, I'm gonna show this because people are waiting for it.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,219
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

35
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,219
Happy Roblox birthday to whoever that was a week ago.

36
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:48,680
I actually don't remember who it is.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Are you kidding me?

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,199
Yeah, Poke, it's somebody's birthday.

39
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
That's the reason why I'm playing Roblox today.

40
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,199
Well, happy birthday, somebody.

41
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,219
Yeah, happy birthday.

42
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,210
Is it a real person?

43
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,090
I think so, yeah.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,650
I actually think it's somebody's birthday. Who is it?

45
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,300
It's my birthday.

46
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Is it really? Happy birthday, dude.

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Yeah, you didn't get me anything, but this will suffice.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,469
Tell me I haven't been hitting you up daily to play Roblox.

49
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,909
Yeah, you can have some of that giant cookie over there if you want.

50
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,909
Save it. I'll be there.

51
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,909
I didn't get a fucking cake.

52
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,909
I've kind of been sick for four days.

53
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,539
Well, then it's not really a party.

54
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,539
Oh, there's a delay on the camera. Oops.

55
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:41,250
Hold on, I'll fix it.

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,250
No, there isn't. You're a liar.

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,560
Oh, they're lying. Okay.

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,310
Alright, are we ready?

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

60
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,550
What? What?

61
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,789
Okay, so this is Roblox, right? It's a kid's game.

62
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,349
Kind of.

63
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,780
Kind of.

64
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,780
On the main menu, how come I've already got Survive Michael Jackson?

65
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,240
It's a kid's game.

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Hold on, there is a delay.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
I fixed the delay.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
I fixed the delay.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I fixed the delay.

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I fixed the delay.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Wait.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,040
What?

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Alright, Poke.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
We got to...

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,420
Poke, you've got to help us.

76
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm trying really hard.

77
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
I tried to make a list.

78
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
I have five things.

79
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
That works.

80
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
We can jump into random stuff.

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,420
I want to do Survive Michael Jackson in the kid's game.

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Why don't we just do that right now?

83
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,660
First thing.

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,660
I don't want to play Survive Michael Jackson.

85
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Why not?

86
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Wait, it's my birthday and I don't even get to pick the game.

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,480
Alright, do we have to make a party or do we just all join that one?

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,379
I think you could join or we could join off you and friends.

89
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,689
Okay, I think I can just join it.

90
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,339
Yeah.

91
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,339
Okay, so let's go.

92
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,709
Wait, no.

93
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,709
Is the server going to fill with people if we say what we're doing?

94
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,529
Probably.

95
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:13,050
Oh, shit.

96
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,540
But there should be a lot of people playing it regardless.

97
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
There are so many of these.

98
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Which one?

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
How many?

100
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Area 51?

101
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,889
Yeah.

102
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,959
Survive Michael Jackson in Area 51 Kill Killers.

103
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,959
Oh, my God.

104
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,959
4.2 million people have played this.

105
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,959
Alright, I'm just going in.

106
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,959
Are we just going in?

107
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,779
Yep.

108
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:41,779
We just click the play button.

109
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,779
We just join off you and friends.

110
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,779
How loud is this game, by the way?

111
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,490
Should I turn it down or something or does that not matter?

112
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,899
It might be loud.

113
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:53,339
Okay, hold on.

114
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,829
Oh, my God, dude.

115
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:58,930
Did you see my character?

116
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,189
I'm joining you right now.

117
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:07,810
I have a rocket launcher?

118
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,810
I just saw you fall in the hole.

119
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,939
Oh, wait.

120
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:11,939
There's in-game voice.

121
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,500
Oh, you have to put your ID for that.

122
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,829
So if you're not verified, you won't hear voice.

123
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,829
Okay, I thought I heard something.

124
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:20,829
I got spooked.

125
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,100
Rocket launcher.

126
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,550
Buy.

127
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,860
No!

128
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,610
Did I just buy it?

129
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,610
Oh, cancel.

130
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,610
How much Roblox?

131
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,610
Do you have any Roblox?

132
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,610
I have like $100 in Roblox or something.

133
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,879
199 Roblox is like $1.

134
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,879
It's like five cents.

135
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,529
Alright, let's go.

136
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,149
Let's play this game.

137
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,149
I'm the guy behind you.

138
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,149
Oh, where are you?

139
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,699
Oh, wow.

140
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,699
What was that?

141
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,699
Who's doing that?

142
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,699
You're doing that in voice?

143
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,699
No, that's Michael Jackson.

144
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,699
What?

145
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,699
Wipe him.

146
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,129
Wait, he's right here.

147
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,129
Oh, my ears.

148
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,129
I can't hear.

149
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
I just ran away from you.

150
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,129
I think I'm dead.

151
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,129
I just saw you die.

152
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,430
What?

153
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,060
Okay, this is very strange.

154
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,230
I'm going to turn the audio down just a little.

155
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,230
I can't hear anything.

156
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
You can't hear that?

157
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,740
I can't hear anything.

158
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:30,439
Let me turn this down.

159
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,439
Hold on.

160
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,319
Wait, Michael Jackson's right there.

161
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,319
Should I turn chat off too?

162
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,319
Or do you keep that on?

163
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,319
I usually hide it.

164
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,319
Or maybe put your camera...

165
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,519
Alright, where's the audio?

166
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,519
There it is.

167
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,519
Oh, my...

168
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,519
Why would they do that?

169
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,519
Why would they have that be the thing that plays when you go down on the volume?

170
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,519
Why would they do that?

171
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,949
I don't even hear anything when I go down.

172
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:56,949
It's using the wrong...

173
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,949
What was it?

174
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,949
It was an extremely loud sound effect when I pressed the down button on the volume.

175
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,949
That's not even fucking cool.

176
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:05,949
What?

177
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:06,949
Jesus.

178
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:12,930
Okay.

179
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,009
Are we all right?

180
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,009
Yeah.

181
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,379
I'm turning this shit all the way fucking down.

182
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,379
Alright, let's go.

183
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,379
I'm so sorry about that.

184
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,370
Alright.

185
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,370
No, I got to turn that off too.

186
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,370
How are you guys enjoying Survive God?

187
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,870
I'm trying to get my sound to even work at all.

188
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,389
You guys want to try a different map?

189
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,389
Yeah, I'm just doing my settings.

190
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,529
Hold on.

191
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,529
We're just getting through this.

192
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,529
Oh, it's a private map, I think.

193
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,529
What's the...

194
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,529
How do I make it so people can't talk in the chat room?

195
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,659
Do I have to do that in my profile?

196
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,659
I don't even know how to turn it off.

197
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,659
I think...

198
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:06,870
Alright, I'll try it one more time.

199
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,159
What just happened?

200
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,159
Why are there two different Michael Jacksons chasing this one person?

201
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,850
Oh, now they're chasing me.

202
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,850
I just aggroed.

203
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:27,289
They cloned them in Area 51.

204
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,740
How do you sprint?

205
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Is there no sprint?

206
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,159
Oh, you can press the chat button.

207
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,679
Hide it.

208
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,580
Top left.

209
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
What is going on?

210
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,950
I wish I was a map that I could see where you guys were.

211
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,580
Okay, I think I got it.

212
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,269
The first sound I heard was...

213
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:57,269
I thought that was one of you guys doing that in the call.

214
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:03,590
I think we're doing pretty good.

215
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,740
How do you win surviving Michael Jackson?

216
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
There might not be a win condition here.

217
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,740
I feel like he just gets everyone eventually.

218
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,419
Alright, that was a good warm-up.

219
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,419
Pog, let's jump to one of the maps.

220
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:27,129
I'm getting us a nice obstacle course map.

221
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:33,590
Why did we let Ster pick the first game?

222
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,980
What were we thinking?

223
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,059
I feel like it's a prerequisite to be able to play anything else.

224
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,059
You need to be able to survive Michael Jackson, then you're free to go around the play lane.

225
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,620
Ster, do I have you?

226
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
I don't know.

227
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I added you.

228
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
I don't know what I'm doing.

229
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,860
Oh, I got you.

230
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Okay, go to your friends list and join off me.

231
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Alright, so what's the easiest way to get out of this without closing the whole application?

232
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,940
You could just close it and then...

233
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Oh, okay.

234
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
You have the website open, right?

235
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah, the app is what is being captured, right?

236
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,179
So is this going to kick me out of the app?

237
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,179
Oh, no.

238
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,179
You exit the experience and it's got me back on the, like, I don't know.

239
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,179
You're on the website?

240
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,549
I got the desktop mode.

241
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,549
Well, I'll use these as a website and then click on the website.

242
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,549
Oh, back home.

243
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,549
I see, back home.

244
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,549
Okay, so I'm going to hide my screen so we can make sure we get in somewhere before everybody else does.

245
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:28,629
So we'll see.

246
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,629
Are you in a game right now, Pog?

247
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,059
Yeah.

248
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:35,539
Can I just join off you somehow?

249
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,539
Yeah, I should be on friends.

250
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,159
See me?

251
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,159
I see you on friends.

252
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,590
I could go to view profile.

253
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,590
Is there join?

254
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,970
On your profile, I can unfriend you.

255
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,720
I don't want to do that.

256
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,370
Okay, hold on.

257
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,299
See all.

258
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,299
Oh, friend activity.

259
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,299
Here it is.

260
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,299
Okay, I see.

261
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,299
Is it this one?

262
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,299
Yeah, that's the one you're in.

263
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,299
All right, going in.

264
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,860
Yeah.

265
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Oh, I see you.

266
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I don't see that you're in one.

267
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,289
Really?

268
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,289
Yeah, I don't see either of you are in a game.

269
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,529
Refresh it.

270
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,529
You just joined one.

271
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,529
Yeah, you got to refresh it.

272
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,860
Well, I saw yours before I saw him.

273
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
You don't know what you're talking about.

274
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,159
What do you mean?

275
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,159
You're an amateur at this.

276
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,159
What are we doing?

277
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
I've never this first time we've you and I have ever opened this whole game.

278
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,129
We're doing this obstacle course stage one out of 50.

279
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:35,700
The popular one right now amongst children.

280
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Okay.

281
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,509
So are we just going for it?

282
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,509
I went for stir.

283
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,509
Is he here?

284
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,509
Oh, they're like move my mouse.

285
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,899
You're going to turn your sensitivity way down.

286
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:48,899
Okay.

287
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,899
You're fire guy, right?

288
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:50,899
You're the phantom fireman.

289
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:51,899
I'm fire guy.

290
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:52,899
Box is way too big.

291
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:53,899
I'm default guy.

292
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,899
Okay.

293
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,460
Yeah, I see you right here.

294
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
And then there's the weird robot with the chain.

295
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,220
All right.

296
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Are we going?

297
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,389
Yeah.

298
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,389
Okay.

299
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,389
Here we go.

300
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,529
All right.

301
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,149
Let's go.

302
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,149
Let's race.

303
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,700
Wee.

304
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Oh, there's a jump.

305
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Oh, okay.

306
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Cool.

307
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Is there any sound on this map?

308
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Yeah, I don't know why it's so quiet.

309
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,509
It's just like footprints.

310
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,509
I don't even hear footprints.

311
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,509
Usually there's like fun music.

312
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,509
Okay.

313
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,509
Be careful when I'm holding right click and that's kind of probably a bad idea.

314
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,509
Right?

315
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:32,720
Because when I turn the camera, I think you press shift once and it goes like into a different

316
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,279
lock.

317
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,279
Oh, all right.

318
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,450
Not bad.

319
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,580
There's no music.

320
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Oh, you can climb too.

321
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,419
Cool.

322
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,419
Oh, shit.

323
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:52,860
All right.

324
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,100
Be careful.

325
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:02,259
I think we're doing pretty good.

326
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,259
Yeah.

327
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,710
Dude, you're a 37 year old man.

328
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,169
Yeah.

329
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,169
Whatever.

330
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,370
Do you have any idea what fucking today is?

331
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,769
Honestly, if the kids are into it, you need to stop being such a boomer and acclimate.

332
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,889
Like if you don't get it, that's on you.

333
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:18,889
It's going to take like two or three hours.

334
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:19,889
Everyone else gets it.

335
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,370
It's going to take me all day to clean up.

336
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,269
I think you guys are like an hour ahead of me.

337
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,580
Did you fall down?

338
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,820
On stage seven.

339
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
You can skip.

340
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,179
You can pay money to skip the stage.

341
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,899
You can pay money.

342
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,899
Yeah.

343
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,649
Wait, why is this?

344
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,600
How come the floor is gone?

345
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Yeah.

346
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm just going to pay the money.

347
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I'll see you guys at the end.

348
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,480
What is happening?

349
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
How much is it to skip?

350
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,659
Wait, there's like weapons.

351
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm going to delete this.

352
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
You have to wait.

353
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,240
You have to buy.

354
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
What?

355
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,970
You stand over it and it's like, hey, use your Robux to get the gravity coil.

356
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,509
How much is this?

357
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,509
800 Robux?

358
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:18,059
That's how they get you.

359
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,620
It's 50% off, dude.

360
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,639
Are you going to pass up that dude?

361
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,299
What the fuck is going on?

362
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,659
Why can I not do this one?

363
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,309
All right.

364
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,940
No, wait, go, go, go, go.

365
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,200
All right.

366
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I made it.

367
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Is there really no music for you?

368
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Like there's no music, right?

369
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
No.

370
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm playing my own.

371
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Okay.

372
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
No.

373
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
There's only like, there's only sound effects.

374
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,610
I don't know why it's so quiet.

375
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,049
How does it even happen?

376
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:54,070
It defaulted audio for me to my VR headset that's not plugged in.

377
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,070
So I think it might have done that again.

378
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,389
I'm so glad I turned it down.

379
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,649
Oh, I need the magic carpet.

380
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,509
Wait, you're going to spend money on the magic carpet, but not on like a cool outfit?

381
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,509
No, I'm not.

382
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,399
I'm a free to play Robloxer.

383
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,600
Whenever you guys are ready for the next map.

384
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,669
I got one.

385
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:16,669
I want to see that.

386
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,769
I want to see how far I can get with this.

387
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,899
Cool.

388
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,899
Yeah.

389
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,899
I saw you playing a game like this earlier today, poke.

390
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,899
So you're all, you're all practice.

391
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,210
Is this person hacking poke?

392
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,210
This person is flying around.

393
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,210
No, you probably paid money.

394
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,450
Okay.

395
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,100
This stage was hard.

396
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,539
So, but all right.

397
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:37,539
I have a question.

398
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:48,909
If you bought the magic carpet to fly around, what's the point of the whole game?

399
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,950
Isn't the whole point like to jump around and jump on the platforms that you just like

400
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,950
fly to the end?

401
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,259
Yeah.

402
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:59,460
But instant gratification, you can just, you can just do it.

403
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,019
They offer the versus took my fucking hair.

404
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,400
What just happened?

405
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,069
Oh, wait.

406
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,069
I got it.

407
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,569
I got it.

408
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,720
I don't know what's happening at like any moment.

409
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,420
I see you over there, poke.

410
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:30,730
I see you going pretty far at a defaulted Roblox to my headset, my VR again.

411
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,220
Don't people make wild, wild shit in this game?

412
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Yeah.

413
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,579
They're a whole like Call of Duty games, right?

414
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,579
And I don't know.

415
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:40,579
Oh, yeah.

416
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,809
I'll show you that one.

417
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,259
Pretty crazy.

418
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,569
I made some progress.

419
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,569
Oh, dude.

420
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,190
Where are you?

421
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,309
I'm on stage 18 out of 50.

422
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,309
You're a little bit ahead of me.

423
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,309
I am.

424
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,309
Yeah.

425
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,130
This person is like, what is this person doing?

426
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,130
It's person out of here.

427
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,130
Get away from me.

428
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,369
What the fuck is this person doing?

429
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,859
Get the fuck away from me.

430
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:02,859
Get out of here.

431
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,799
I have to win so I can hold on.

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,059
Wow.

433
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,460
As someone who didn't get into the fall guys craze, this is probably the best version of

434
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,619
jumping around on colorful blocks that exists.

435
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:18,250
It actually is kind of fun.

436
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,700
It kills you.

437
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
That's pretty sick.

438
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,009
I'm missing music.

439
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,950
He loves the Roblox.

440
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,349
I don't like how quiet it is.

441
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,349
This might be my new main game.

442
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,980
Roblox is great.

443
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I think it's.

444
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
I'm just gonna say it.

445
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,730
What?

446
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,420
I think it's better than Minecraft.

447
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Ooh.

448
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,980
Yeah.

449
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,920
People are gonna hate me for that one.

450
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Oh, you've been doing Minecraft speedruns, haven't you?

451
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Yeah.

452
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,569
It's fun.

453
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,509
Why is there an ad right here for this?

454
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:50,509
Wait, this is an ad?

455
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:58,650
When you see it.

456
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:07,960
When you see it, you'll laugh.

457
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
I'm like enjoying.

458
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm having a good time right now.

459
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,160
I'm actually enjoying this.

460
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
That makes sense to me.

461
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,400
These are like, this is the pace of game you typically enjoy.

462
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,559
Wait, the ad disappeared.

463
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,559
Get out of here.

464
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,559
I didn't see the ad.

465
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,089
Wait, I saw an ad.

466
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,089
You didn't see it.

467
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,089
What the heck?

468
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,329
Sir, did you um.

469
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,329

00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,799
What the, why did I fall?

471
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:49,609
You know that I didn't baby sensory stream. Okay, cool. Yeah, I don't see an ad or anything

472
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:54,769
You got like an actual little yeah an ad on the side for the new Mario movie

Okay, not bad. Here are you zonked right now. What does that mean? People think I like

475
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Smoked weed before I did this no

This is a birthday party that big cookie over there is gonna be shared by all of us. Is that why I'm invited I

481
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:35,140

482
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,039
I heard that you get banned if you do it

483
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,420
Are you supposed to know which color kills you? No, you just pay money probably

484
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Oh, are you at the thing where it's blue and red and yeah

485
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,750
Yeah, so when you touch don't it's very confusing when you touch the red you die. No, but on some of them

486
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:59,609
Opposite yeah, it's called it's a hard game and you get a get good at playing it

487
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:06,519
You're the last person I would expect to complain about a game being like a little difficult

488
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:14,440
Well, I should be higher up on your list because apparently I hate literally every game

489
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,029
What?

490
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,130
You know what now I'll give it to you. This is insane. This is really hard

491
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:36,440
I think anyone who can complete this stage without the magic carpet. Oh, you're almost done. Are you I'm at 44?

492
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,640
Yeah, I'm at 41. Wait, when did I get ahead of you? What I'm on 44. I'm right behind poke

494
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:14,250
Yeah, but what if one of you falls off that could happen. How are you supposed to know which one of those is gonna fall?

495
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:24,849
Hey, it's a hard game man. You gotta buy the glasses on the left side. I got it

Robox looks I can answer that pretty quickly. It was $20 or I believe

498
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:48,720
17 or 1800 roll up dollars, whatever it is. That's what I bought. I made it to 50. Where are my big hands?

499
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,359

503
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:20,440

504
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:42,710
All right. This is it. This is the last part. We're all waiting for you. Wait, you only get three minutes to left to do this

505
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:52,529
Yeah, I think you're the last person. I was the last person to finish it. Yeah, it started the timer

506
00:24:52,529 --> 00:25:06,839
I would do my animation that I bought it was like five dollars. All right, that was fun. Let's keep it rolling

What you act like that? What am I ironic? I can't say that looks cool

509
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:35,990
It was like the germa hashtag ad stream voice shut out really cool. Shut up looks like this looks sick

510
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:51,220

How is this possible to make this in this game? This looks insane

678
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:11,139
What I think I have to go into like the actual source and lower the volume so loud

679
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:16,539
All right, that's a lot better

680
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,579

683
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:48,739
How is this possible? Oh mean stirring a game. I think I'm in a different game. I'm in a different game

00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:02,239
It said friend activity and I joined friend activity

686
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:07,989
Maybe a hard to play together on this one. Oh

687
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:18,920
Maybe because of the teams you're trash at this game. Yeah, whatever

688
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:32,880
Have okay, I'm not impressed with the graphics. I'm impressed that they have

691
00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:01,349
That's that's a lot more complicated than making things look pretty. I'm sure someone dedicated to the blocks

692
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,530
blocks together

693
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:19,289
Turn up your graphics. Yeah, I think they're there's not even a graphics slider or setting in the game. Is there that's what you think

694
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:28,090
Your grenades definitely

695
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:36,619
Shit, I do so bad with hold instead of toggle

696
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:46,670
Anybody any okay you two is aim down sights for you hard to do with him. It's hold or are you a toggle?

697
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,190
It depends on the game really I think I'm a holder

698
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:58,530
I'm always toggle. Yeah, I'm a holder

699
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,730
I like toggle for some games. I'm gonna let me get I'm gonna try to get in your guys game

700
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:17,219
All right friend activity as you're in it. Yeah, I'm older. I'm lines. It's just friends. Can't you okay?

701
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:26,579
I think it's because it's full. You know, oh, it's full. Your your game is full. Did you leave I?

702
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:31,110
Leave I was never in your guys game. Oh

703
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,159
People are saying we should do a scary one called doors and it's like

704
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:44,769
Telling me to do doors. Yeah, it's like the best roblox game. I think in terms of like where are

705
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah, where's the like, how do I spend my roblox in here to fly?

706
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah, we have in this where's like the paper the magic carpet you can like customize your whole gun

707
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,480
It look at my sensitivity guys like I

708
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:06,380
This is so fucked up. All right, it's okay. Everything feels so wrong

709
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:15,780
Yeah, roblox has a lot of fun shooters. They're really fun ones because it's really easy because you're just shooting

710
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:18,300
different iPads

711
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,739
This is ironically incredibly impressive. This is actually

712
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:35,889
Blowing my mind how actually cool. This is first kill ever got it. Finally first kill

713
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:46,619
Mr. German 95 your game is running at automatic graphics. Your computer is probably not good enough. Wait. Oh, wait, it's had zero

714
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:56,400
Oh shit. This looks really good now. Yeah, Jeremy. You can play this on your iPad by the way

715
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:08,619
Yeah, there's plenty of very fun games on the iPad. There's plenty of great experiences to enjoy on a mobile device

716
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:22,739
This is one of them. Yeah, we definitely should do some horror games too because you know, everybody loves those

717
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,019
Am I in a game alone right now? I

718
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:30,320
think I think it's hard to get in the game together because

719
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:38,260
It's just because the game just get full. I want to play with my friends. Okay, I'm only a

720
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,050
Shooting game where you just get like a random gun all the time

721
00:49:48,699 --> 00:50:04,380
Team kill right?

722
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,780
The one we just

723
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,139
Jackson one I

724
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:20,440
Feel like the people that I'm playing against are better than like top 500 overwatch

725
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:22,260
Yeah

726
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:30,079
That was really cool. I enjoyed that. We should play squid game. People are saying should we play squid game?

727
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,380
I know you die if you do that

728
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:35,099
Only one of us would get to live

729
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:38,630
I'm ready to hop in on

730
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,789
You should be able to join me off friends list

731
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,750
People make this joke and I know you were making this joke earlier

732
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:50,710
But just being able to jump from experience to experience really is kind of that's my cup of tea

733
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,989
You just can just play what I just jump in it

734
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:57,710

00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,469
My brain is having hold on

748
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:29,019
Sensitivity, I'll never get it right hearing every time we get in a game. I have to get it off my VR

749
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:34,250
What the fuck was that? Oh this guy's headshot

00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:55,829
I know I'm having trouble finding the right

00:52:56,269 --> 00:53:09,389
Middle ground. I don't even know where you change just go to the sense of type 0.3. This is fun, too

823
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:36,389
Do something in here, but I can't touch it. Never mind. We're gone gold on table. What do you use the money for?

824
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:39,829

829
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:40,130
This would be way scarier if we didn't all look like dickheads

830
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:48,639
You know, I to me this is not scary anymore because stir your character looks like this it's no longer scary

831
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:55,760
I mean your hands you're the scariest dude here. It has so much detail in veins
