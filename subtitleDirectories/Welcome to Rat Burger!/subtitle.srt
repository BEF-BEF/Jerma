1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,669
Hey, where do we make the cheeseburgers?

2
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,219
I love how we each have a different name.

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,219
Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stealth. No, no, no, no, no. Do not just start...

4
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,219
This is... What are you doing?

5
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,219
That's not me.

6
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,219
Oh, shit.

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,219
Why are you Star's girlfriend?

8
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,519
No, no.

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,519
I thought we were doing it at the date.

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,519
Oh, yeah?

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,460
Alright, so...

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,460
I can't control his mouth sensitivity.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,460
You have to turn your, like, DPI down.

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,460
I can't fight my mouth sensitivity.

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,460
This is so high.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,770
Alright, you are seriously, you are seriously messing this whole thing up, you guys.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,770
We were supposed to build burgers.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,770
You guys are just taking all the ingredients and throwing them all over the place.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,770
We got people coming around.

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,770
They're just putting them on the floor.

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,770
We have customers.

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm going to say hi.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Look, you need to look at, like, the note board to see what we have to do.

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,980
I'm just watching Star, like, literally just hold his hands out and just hold left to right as he goes down the road.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
What are you doing?

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Trying to fix this shit.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,120
You have just, like, single-handedly destroyed what we were doing.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,019
Can we actually make a burger or are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?

29
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,329
Look, come out here.

30
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,329
You sprint.

31
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,329
You can sprint.

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,590
I figured I'd just change the field of view.

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,590
There are people out here looking for cheeseburgers.

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,590
This guy wants a bacon burger.

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,590
Alright, we got to set this up.

36
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,590
This guy wants a bacon burger.

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,590
This guy wants...

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,590
There's so many people in here.

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,180
There's, like, sick people in here.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
This guy wants a...

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,670
There is a burger patty.

42
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,670
She's not happy.

43
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:54,909
Alright, who wanted the lettuce?

44
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,090
No, nobody.

45
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,090
Alright, seriously.

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,090
Meeting.

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,090
Team meeting.

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,900
Team meeting.

49
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,079
Uh-oh, the manager is displeased.

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,079
I am not happy.

51
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
You guys...

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
One of you guys is getting fired.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Hey, look at all this stuff on the grill.

54
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah, it's all burnt.

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Go to the front desk.

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Go to the front.

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,330
I got a burger.

58
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,330
Wait, what do you mean?

59
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,330
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,259
No!

61
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,289
He took the patty.

62
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,289
Catch it.

63
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,289
Someone catch it.

64
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,289
I caught it.

65
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,289
I caught it.

66
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,289
And she's still in the restaurant.

67
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,289
Oh, there goes the rat.

68
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,129
Oh, he snagged it.

69
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,129
Oh, no.

70
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,129
Look at this trail of rats.

71
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,129
Look at the live rats.

72
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,300
They're all...

73
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
It's like a rat fight.

74
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,669
They're all going after this one piece of meat.

75
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,669
This one guy.

76
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,909
Don't let them get away.

77
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,280
We are chasing this rat all the way down the street.

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,479
Come here, you son of a bitch.

79
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,479
I got it.

80
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,479
I got the rat.

81
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,479
Look at all these people just watching.

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,300
We caught the wrong one.

83
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Can we actually play this game?

84
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,050
We're not.

85
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,289
Hold on.

86
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,289
Everyone get in the back.

87
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,289
These rats are burned.

88
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,289
They are crisp.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're not even...

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They're dead.

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're black.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, we can finish the rat burger.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I found the patty that they ran away from.

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All right, get the rat and put it on the bun.

95
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,020
I'm crying right now.

96
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
This is so stupid.

97
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,020
Okay, can we please restart this?

98
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,020
I don't have any fucking rats everywhere.

99
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,669
How do I get the rat?

100
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,669
I don't even know how you draw.

101
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,669
How do you even control this?

102
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,669
I think it screws up in multiplayer.

103
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,669
It looks like a two-year-old drawing.

104
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,669
You're holding two?

105
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:04,669
All right.

106
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,909
All right, follow me, though.

107
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,909
There is a prisoner back here.

108
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:09,909
There's a person back here.

109
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,909
Oh, my God.

110
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:11,909
You fucking idiot.

111
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:12,909
What are you doing?

112
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,909
We just remade this game.

113
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:15,909
Why?

114
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,339
You're fired.

115
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,339
There's a person.

116
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,339
What?

117
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,339
There's a guy in here.

118
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,339
I know.

119
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,600
That's what I was saying.

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
What's wrong with this guy?

121
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Can we punch him?

122
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,899
He is the rat mama.

123
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,899
Can I pick him up?

124
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,779
What if you could pick him up and make a person sandwich?

125
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,779
No.

126
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,779
Oh, no.

127
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,779
No.

128
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,779
We all conspired against you.

129
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,779
Yeah, it's just like all at once.

130
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,779
No one said anything.

131
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:47,779
I'm very happy with our teamwork.

132
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,779
I am completely lost.

133
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,779
There's no way I'm getting out of this.

134
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,779
We did that very silently.

135
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:53,779
We all knew.

136
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,779
You dicks.

137
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,959
It's just me and this weird hermit guy back here now.

138
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
He's fighting through the shrubbery.

139
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,589
I'm fighting through.

140
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,589
He's bringing the rats.

141
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,339
We're doing it.

142
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,339
Also, we're wearing bandanas and look like pirates.

143
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,529
Okay, Star, you're not allowed to look.

144
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,529
Not allowed to look?

145
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,529
No, because you're the burger judge.

146
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,529
There's people coming in.

147
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,529
There's customers.

148
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,529
I'll talk the people down.

149
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,529
You got to show them to their seats.

150
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,529
I'll lower their expectations.

151
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,529
Lower their expectations because they're going to probably throw up after eating one of our burgers.

152
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm going to go.

153
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
You look mad.

154
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
Oh, I picked something up.

155
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Yeah, still.

156
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
We have to make burgers.

157
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
We have to make our own delicious cheeseburgers.

158
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,839
By second rule.

159
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,839
By second rule.

160
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,839
Start with a bun.

161
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,839
Everyone get away from each other because we're just going to knock into stuff.

162
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,839
I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.

163
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:51,019
So here's my burger station is going to be right next to the sink.

164
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,019
In the bathroom.

165
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,019
Yeah, I'll be in the bathroom with my...

166
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,800
Oh, well, the cheese is completely...

167
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
My cheese, seriously, is just like a black tile.

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
You don't put the cheese on the grill.

169
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I wanted to like melt it.

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
You don't put the cheese on the grill.

171
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay, well, get out of my station.

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,360
You dick.

173
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
You son of a bitch.

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,360
He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.

175
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,790
Hey, hey, you don't got to...

176
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,790
You got to play to win.

177
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,790
Oh my...

178
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,790
Where are you from?

179
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,790
Never...

180
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,439
Star, just pretend like you didn't hear that.

181
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you doing back here?

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How are you like multiplying these bacons, Star?

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come back here.

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Come back here.

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's going on?

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I know how to break everything.

188
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are you?

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's like duping poop.

190
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm in the back room.

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,579
What the hell?

192
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,910
How did you get all this bacon?

193
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,910
I'm the Baconator.

194
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,910
I'm the Baconator.

195
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,910
Who's under the ground?

196
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,910
Jeremy, you're under the ground.

197
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,910
What the fuck?

198
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,910
Oh no.

199
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,910
What the fuck did you do?

200
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,910
No.

201
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,910
I'm gone.

202
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,149
I was so hard on that.

203
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,149
Oh, Phil.

204
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,149
Oh, Phil.

205
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,779
Where am I?

206
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,779
I don't know.

207
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,779
I'm...

208
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,779
Somebody else fell.

209
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:06,779
Somebody else fell.

210
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:13,649
Who just fell?

211
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,649
You went wizened by my screen.
