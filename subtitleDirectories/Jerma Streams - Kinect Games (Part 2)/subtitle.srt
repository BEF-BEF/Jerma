1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:08,099
Hey, what's happening? So uh, I gotta do something real quick. I promised I was gonna do this.

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,619
Just make sure that I'm ready to go and I'm gonna do a backflip right now.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:22,250
Here comes backflip. That was a pretty good landing. I stuck it completely. I'll do uh,

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:32,359
do two in a row. Do two in a row. Okay, okay, I'll try. Damn. All right. I kind of hurt my

5
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:45,850
back a little bit doing that. I'm all right. Anyways, hi. How are you? Well, the Kinect,

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:55,689
Kinect crap. Welcome to the fucking Kinect crap day two. My name is GermanN85. How are you doing?

7
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:08,780
Today, we're gonna do some extra, and not extras, we're gonna do some extra. We've got

8
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:15,900
Kinect Star Wars. That's gonna be a popular one. I can already tell. We've got Into the Nightmare,

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,049
whatever this horror movie is. We've got Harry Potter, episodes five, six, and seven.

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,079
We've got, what else do we got? Oh, I'm not even gonna say the name of that one or it'll give it

11
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:49,140
away. Gotta get that out. I did three, I did four backflips in a row, so I had to kind of get that

12
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,909
out of my system. We're gonna start with Kinect Star Wars. By the way, I want to make sure you

13
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,750
understand this because I need to say it a few times. I know what's in this game, and this will

14
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:14,310
be the only time ever, and I really mean this, ever, that you're going to see me dance on this

15
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:25,210
string. Ever. We're gonna do one song, I think, and I know it's the one you go like this. And,

16
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:33,990
oh fuck, not ready. Not ready. Hold on. Not ready. Not ready. Not ready. Not ready. I forgot about

17
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:42,069
my wireless Bluetooth setup. Hold on, not ready. Not ready. My wireless, like, Bluetooth setup. I

18
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,819
didn't put it, I didn't set it up. God damn it, I had to charge it. It shouldn't take too long.

19
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,539
How could I forget about my fucking wireless capabilities? All right, this is good. That's

20
00:02:53,539 --> 00:03:01,879
it. Where's the, okay, there's the right. Just gotta sync it, and I'm ready to go. Hold on.

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:17,319
God damn it, my god, this is stupid. All right, syncing now. Here we go. Battery fully charged.

22
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:27,379
I just got confirmation. Sync up. Do it. Sync up, please. Come on. Don't make me look like a fool.

23
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:44,680
Number one. Bluetooth pairing successful. Bluetooth connected. Oh yeah. Yeah, don't

24
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:52,629
even tell me. I don't know. Fuck, I don't know. See that image? All right, I gotta test it. I gotta

25
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:04,419
test it. Hold on. Let's go over here. Just like tie in a tie. On the neck, under, and then over.

26
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,259
Make it a little looser. All right, I got my tie on. Wait, that's not good.

27
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,779
How did I do this last time? How did I do this last time? Did anybody see me do it?

28
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,339
Did anybody actually see me do this last time? No, you didn't. All right, I'm ready. Here we go.

29
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:31,259
Through the loop. Tighten it. There we go. Through the loop again. Into the shirt. That's what it was.

30
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:42,389
All right, I'm good. All right. All right. Synced up. Here we go. It's time to play Star Wars.

31
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:50,009
The Kinect version. Why did they just spit the disc out at me? Why? What's, what are you talking

32
00:04:50,009 --> 00:05:02,550
about? They just like spit it back up. Okay, I think we're good. Welcome everybody to Kinect.

33
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:34,199
Crap, my pants too. I got water this time. I probably should turn it down. It might be a

34
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,819
little too loud. Just a little bit. That's better. So remember, this is Kinect. If you don't know

35
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,740
what the Kinect is, it is a terminal reality. It's a virtual reality simulation system.

36
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:56,870
How do I skip all this? This game auto saves automatically. Please do not turn off your

37
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:08,439
console when you see this symbol. Do be careful. Well, auto. We're most insistent that we not

38
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:16,620
disturb anything. I walked into Star Wars. This is a very important assignment. I honestly couldn't

39
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:24,300
Oh, auto. Oh, hello. I am C3PO, human cyborg relations. Auto. Master Luke said we would

40
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,420
meet you here. We're most excited to have you supervise our mission. Very good. Uh, start game.

41
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:43,459
Start game. Start game. I said the microphone symbol's down there. I'm supposed to assume

42
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,350
it's not going to work. It's like continue to play using this profile or sign in to choose a

43
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:58,360
different one. This game uses drop in drop. Yeah, it's 10 to Dragoon 74. It's me. Yes, we're running.

44
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,879
This is going to start to get low here over the next few Kinect streams, I think.

45
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,000
And yes, I've got the thing in the hair. Make sure it doesn't get in my face today.

46
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,319
Of course, I qualified R2. How else do you think we got this assignment?

47
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,319
R2.

48
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:45,689
Jedi Destiny Dark Side Rising. We've also got Podracing? Podracing? Galactic Dance-off.

49
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,129
Translating all these files into Shrevewook? We'd be here for centuries.

50
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:55,589
Rancor Rampage? When am I going to use my lightsaber? Duel of Fates. I can't use my

51
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:01,990
lightsaber yet. I'm not doing the dance-off first. Absolutely not. Okay, what about Jedi Destiny?

52
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,189
The history of an entire species. Jedi Destiny Dark Side Rising. Let's do this one.

53
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,180
If I'm interpreting this correctly, I want to use the lightsaber.

54
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:21,459
I'm not doing the dance-off first. That's like the pinnacle of all online content.

55
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,540
I think I'm going to do that first. It's the only time I'm ever going to get this dance-off

56
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:37,879
straight. Like the best thing that I will ever do on this channel. Like the most highly rated

57
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:45,659
thing that I will ever fucking do. Here we go. Get away. Excellent. Now call up the file, R2.

58
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:54,659
Let's take a better look at the commander selection. Begin the destiny. Am I the Jedi

59
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:05,740
in Star Wars Connect? No. I have to pick from a random Jedi? The Jedi history really is quite

60
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,139
stirring. Honestly, my compassion algorithms have never seen so much use. I can't be like Darth Me?

61
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:22,899
I don't know why I want to play it. I think I'm going to be the alien over here.

62
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:28,659
By my calculations, there is a 63.44% chance that any of these operations will end in failure.

63
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:42,539
When dealer is showing a six, I know C-3PO. What's good about the singe? Casual or advanced.

64
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,299
That was a fucking funny joke because that actually is the percentage. It's like 63.4%.

65
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,299
I swear to God, that's a funny joke. I don't care if anybody thinks it's funny.

66
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,779
The record begins with Master Zane and her padawans approaching the planet.

67
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:07,139
The training never stops. What are you doing? I want to select my padawan? That's me, right?

68
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:21,159
Okay, Darth Singe. Oh, it's flip two. Whatever. Let's go. What did I do?

69
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,139
Let's see if I can get a good spot with the sun beams right into my fucking eyes.

70
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:43,139
I'll get it. Star Wars. Right. Oh, he's singing. That means he has to go like this.

71
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:55,320
All right. How do I make it go faster? Go faster. It is a time of uncertainty.

72
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,019
It is a time of uncertainty alarmed by the encounter with the Sith Lord Darth Maul

73
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,059
on Naboo. The Jedi Council has begun strengthening the ranks of the Jedi Order.

74
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,340
By opening training outposts to instruct a new generation of padawan learners.

75
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,669
Meanwhile, events throughout the galaxy suggest that the influence of the dark side is spreading.

76
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:29,139
A group of padawans are on their way to Kashyyyk, home world of the Wookiees, to learn about the

77
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:35,000
force in preparation for the difficult times ahead. The narrator doesn't know how to...

78
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,629
All right, let's go. Is that synced up? You should hear the snap of my handcuffs

79
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:52,019
up there like that. Bored. Let's go.

80
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:18,230
It's a new guy. It's a new guy. Welcome, padawans. Each one of you is strong in the force. Brave.

81
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:27,370
Instructed in the teachings of our order. But not all of you will become Jedi. As you know,

82
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:35,980
the ones must proceed through a series of trials. Trials of skill, courage, insight.

83
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,460
I'm roleplaying. Stop.

84
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,299
Stop. You're gonna blow this for me. Stop.

85
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,769
Blow it for me. I'm gonna pick my lightsaber now.

86
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,539
No, that's not me.

87
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,190
I think this is cutting off circulation of my brain.

88
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,049
It is me.

89
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,110
You got it.

90
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:26,490
Feel the force flow between you and the pedestal. Take a moment to feel its weight.

91
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:36,490
Oh, shit. He's insane. Let's start with some simple drills. Swing back and forth until you

92
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,809
feel comfortable. Shouldn't we step back from each other? You're too... I think you're too close.

93
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:43,049
We're gonna clan. Some of the ancient Jedi forms.

94
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:51,129
You've been practicing these since you were younglings. Very good, padawan.

95
00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:04,169
Should I clang him? Just ding. Does this block? Oh, I was doing that.

96
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:15,620
I didn't get to customize my character. All right, that's a really dangerous move

97
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,340
because if you fuck that up, that goes through your back and kills you.

98
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,019
Like, even if you're slightly off, I mean, it looks real cool.

99
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,820
But that literally goes through the back of your skull when you die.

100
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:34,490
Oh, yeah? I mean, that was kind of cool teach. Check this out.

101
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:36,730
Dad, I win.

102
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,620
Can I two-hand? I'm a two-handed sword kind of guy.

103
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:59,460
As Master Yoda can attest, we live in an uncivilized time.

104
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,139
In combat, many of your opponents will use blasters.

105
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,340
If you can't get close enough to strike your enemy, you'll need to deflect their blaster bolts.

106
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,779
So you just gotta go, bing. Now it's your turn.

107
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,450
Audio is decent. I don't care. Some enemies will attack from a distance.

108
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,649
Use your lightsaber for deflection. I'm not doing this shit like yesterday.

109
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:34,809
Very good. One guy's not going to turn the stream off for like 30 minutes to get beat up.

110
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,169
I know it's safe. I checked it. It's not perfect, but it never will be.

111
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,529
Oh, let's do it.

112
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:14,009
Padawan, you must deflect these laser blasts.

113
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:14,970
No Padawan is perfect.

114
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,090
I've done it four times.

115
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,850
No Jedi Knight either, for that matter.

116
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,149
Good work.

117
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,470
I'm sorry, I gotta D.

118
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,320
I gotta D.

119
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,399
There will be times when your opponent won't simply vaporize or be sliced into pieces.

120
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,960
Sometimes you will have a true duel.

121
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,519
You two, come forward.

122
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Let's move on. You'll need some space for this, so spread out.

123
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,799
Of course, these are all training sabers, so no one will lose an arm today.

124
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,840
I want to do the thing that you did.

125
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,879
And it will cost quite a wealth, though. Wouldn't be very instructive.

126
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,639
I can't do it from behind the back?

127
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,919
Engage your opponents. Attempt to block their lightsaber strikes.

128
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,879
Left, right, high, low. Pay close attention to the enemy's attacks.

129
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,250
Move your saber to the correct position, Padawan.

130
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:17,849
I just what? Okay. I thought I just got my head.

131
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,809
You can do better to defend yourself. Also, a quick dodge or jump at the right moment

132
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,490
allows you to avoid. Why am I dodging?

133
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,970
I shouldn't be dodging. Defend yourself against your enemy,

134
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,170
you have the opportunity to change the momentum of the fight.

135
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,609
To put it on your terms. Why am I dodging?

136
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:47,000
I shouldn't be dodging. Why is it blocked to dodge?

137
00:17:47,720 --> 00:18:01,740
Once you now have your opening to train and try to defeat your opponent in a duel.

138
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,390
I'm going to clash.

139
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,079
Do I have to hold it? Do I have to kick him? Okay.

140
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:55,960
There we go. There we go.

141
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,009
Please, whoa, don't do a finishing move. Is that it?

142
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:02,650
Well done.

143
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:05,980
Fatality.

144
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:10,869
A good beginning, Padawan, but there'll be much more to learn on Kashyyyk.

145
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,779
Prepare for arrival.

146
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,160
And now it's time for your next Jedi technique.

147
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
The fucking dancing.

148
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,069
All right, this is gonna be real.

149
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:45,740
All right, let's go.

150
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:56,339
I think you're ready to block. Block, block.

151
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,150
Slash. Should I skip the cinematic?

152
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,430
Does anybody care about Star Wars?

153
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,380
No, nobody cares about the story in Star Wars.

154
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,779
They just care about the light thing that makes cool sounds.

155
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,859
Master Windu was here too.

156
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,019
I can't believe it. It's Obi-Wan kind of Sith boy.

157
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:24,710
Danger? Great hope in you. We have.

158
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,309
Tomorrow, your lessons begin.

159
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,099
Here are your new trainees, Master Yoda.

160
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,019
I'll warn you, they're still very rough, but they do have potential.

161
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,500
Say the same for you. We once did, long ago.

162
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,210
No Padawan could ask for a better master than you.

163
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,769
A pleasure you were.

164
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,660
You've done very well, Ma'am. A council sanction.

165
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,700
We know you understand the importance of this undertaking.

166
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:09,059
My turn yet?

167
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,579
There's something troubling you, Master Yoda.

168
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,430
Something dark I see in these Padawans' future.

169
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,619
We have all sensed it, and yet the council's vision remains clouded.

170
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,900
The events on Naboo, Darth Maul's appearance, these were no aberrations.

171
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,259
There is a darkness rising in the galaxy, and the Sith Master waits in the shadows.

172
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:38,569
I must return now to Coruscant. May the Force be with you.

173
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,980
No, they did it to wipe the source Lucas, right?

174
00:21:48,700 --> 00:22:05,720
Your training does.

175
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
Why is this Wipeout Wookiee edition?

176
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,299
Wait, hold on, do I have to do this?

177
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,539
I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.

178
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:22,170
I'm standing here, I'm standing right here.

179
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,690
Okay, I have to do Wipeout Wookiee challenge.

180
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:39,700
Focus, focus into your center, then explode outward with a kick.

181
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:51,210
And wipe out man.

182
00:22:52,009 --> 00:23:06,180
Source senses, avoid these obstacles quickly. Explode quickly to avoid the logs.

183
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,339
Time has come that this is only a test.

184
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,380
Go! What the fuck are you doing?

185
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,230
I hate this.

186
00:23:45,269 --> 00:24:13,750
What? Am I out of like, Naruto powers?

187
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:21,029
For most of the end we are.

188
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,710
Help you, I could, but then you would not learn.

189
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,670
Why can't I just walk?

190
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:36,359
Use your senses to jump at the right time.

191
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,480
Once more, Padawan.

192
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,119
I don't know.

193
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:49,240
I jumped through it.

194
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,599
I just want to walk.

195
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,970
He's laughing at you?

196
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,980
Use the force to knock over the training dummy.

197
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:34,710
What? Wrong arm.

198
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,029
Concentrate, focus.

199
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:38,230
Do not be afraid.

200
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,740
You have the most serious mind.

201
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,630
Guide you, these will.

202
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm itching my leg.

203
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,880
He's like, putting his hand.

204
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,279
I can't like, itch my leg.

205
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, get in there! It's like, come on!

206
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,140
And heavy objects will live.

207
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,640
Oh.

208
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:20,700
Yeah, test your skill.

209
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,200
This will.

210
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,480
Yes.

211
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:26,779
This is just Jillian Michaels in the jungle workout for James.

212
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,380
Cannot withstand the power of the force.

213
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,819
Now we have to play Angry Birds.

214
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,900
Use the force to select the rocks.

215
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:55,240
And at the tower, fling them.

216
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,740
Not bad.

217
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,640
Very good.

218
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,180
First hit, first try.

219
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,369
With a simple rock, an explosive.

220
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:10,859
You manipulate it by holding your hand out and focus your energy on the rock.

221
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,359
To catch it, catch with you can.

222
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,400
And redirect it.

223
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,900
Yes.

224
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,079
What? Catch it? Oh, catch the rock.

225
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:28,460
Am I trying to hit you on the head?

226
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,619
Imitation.

227
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:39,289
Precision to your display.

228
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:39,789
Okay.

229
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:40,569
No more training.

230
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:41,069
Not bad.

231
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:42,650
I don't even need any more training.

232
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,730
I know you. That what you need.

233
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,759
I gotta stop walking forward.

234
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm just like, wandering around like an idiot.

235
00:27:49,640 --> 00:28:06,359
Uh-oh, here we go.

236
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,839
Here comes the lip.

237
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:12,569
Senate Scythe.

238
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,799
That's it, if you've never seen Star Wars before.

239
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,430
Don't.

240
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,500
It's literally like, it's just too much.

241
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:29,579
That was it.

242
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,400
I took out the whole thing.

243
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:40,789
Yeah, Star Wars, it's a whole thing.

244
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,470
This is like 30, 40 books.

245
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:49,130
I love to say, oh, but the Star Wars movies now, it's based on like 50 novels.

246
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,890
And they're all like a thousand pages long.

247
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,769
It's just, it's a lot.

248
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,849
The books, you know, they're all right.

249
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:58,089
But if you really want to get the whole thing, you gotta read them all.

250
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,190
The movies really condense everything down way too much.

251
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:15,640
I think the first, so episode four, which is Star Wars, it was for a lost city.

252
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,240
It's like, I think this, it's like the middle 30 books.

253
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,640
Like, there's like 20, book 20 to book 35.

254
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,480
You can really start the books out of one or two, which everyone was like, what the fuck is this?

255
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,460
Like, it was episode, book 20 came out in 1970 or something.

256
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:39,430
You see how much that doesn't make any sense when you talk about other pieces of media?

257
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,829
George.

258
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,710
This thing's gonna explode.

259
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,829
Oh, I thought we were gonna do it.

260
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:06,809
I thought we were just gonna blow up.

261
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,009
Is this gonna kill us both?

262
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:22,940
Quick, Yoda, bail.

263
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,859
Bail out Yoda.

264
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,140
Go find us a motorcycle.

265
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:43,099
Actually, the control's pretty good.

266
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:46,940
How do you break?

267
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:59,980
Thank God there's a shield.

268
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,579
Otherwise, a regenerating shield.

269
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,380
Otherwise, Yoda, we would be in some shit right now.

270
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Break out.

271
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,859
Not bad.

272
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,599
No, there's more.

273
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,799
This is boss.

274
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,319
Boss ship.

275
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:33,140
Is it telegraphing on the ground?

276
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,980
It makes this a lot easier, I guess.

277
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:44,680
Don't, thank God.

278
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,069
Oh, I did advanced difficulty too, didn't I?

279
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,890
Now you finally said something.

280
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,359
Look at the trees.

281
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,200
Oh, sorry, Yoda.

282
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,640
I thought that I was gonna drive into them.

283
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,309
Shit.

284
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,450
Am I going the right way?

285
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:26,680
Stop talking in front of me.

286
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,400
I don't care about the...

287
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,880
Break.

288
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,380
All right, so Yoda's gonna jump off and slash him?

289
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,819
Oh, we just got to get that last little scene.

290
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:52,460
That's pretty cool.

291
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,839
Break the disk?

292
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,309
I'm not gonna shred every Kinect disk.

293
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,460
Cross the water to the village.

294
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,769
We'll shoot them.

295
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,009
If I'm gonna break, you need to shoot.

296
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:55,740
All right, I was supposed to go that way.

297
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:03,849
There's a big wave bracer.

298
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:05,880
It reminds me of it.

299
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,539
All right, I'm done with the bracing around shooting.

300
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,300
Can we do anything else, Yoda?

301
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,809
I can't see.

302
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:36,760
This is a blur.

303
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,239
It's blur.

304
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,800
It's a blur.

305
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
I swear to God, it's a blur.

306
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:42,869
That was all the same thing we were saying.

307
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:52,300
What the fuck?

308
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,300
Can I break?

309
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:23,510
No, fuck.

310
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,349
Thank God this saves states.

311
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:26,869
10 seconds to shoot.

312
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:29,079
Let's do it.

313
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:44,820
Just like that?

314
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,780
Good job, Yoda.

315
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:47,940
We make a great team.

316
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,219
They should make a movie about us.

317
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,300
Don't worry, they will.

318
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,539
At last, the village we have reached.

319
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:00,429
They will.

320
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:07,030
That wasn't very fun.

321
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,030
I don't think that was very fun at all.

322
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,829
I like the Jedi stuff.

323
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:23,739
I think I know why the Kinect failed.

324
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,860
Because 75% of every single Kinect game is dodge left or dodge right.

325
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,260
That's if they didn't do anything else.

326
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,599
Go like this or go like that.

327
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,219
That's almost every single one of these.

328
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:47,260
And sometimes you go like this.

329
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:57,320
I'm here, right?

330
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,619
You're training.

331
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,139
And may the force be with you.

332
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,809
All right, this is what I wanted to do.

333
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:24,500
I feel like I played Harry Potter the exact same way.

334
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,500
This is deflecting.

335
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,260
All right, now go in.

336
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:38,760
You missed one on your right.

337
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,079
Get over here.

338
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,139
Come here.

339
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,409
I had a chance.

340
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:51,690
Didn't work.

341
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:05,780
All involved.

342
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,500
All of your friends.

343
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,590
I want to do an actual deflect like that.

344
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,170
Like that.

345
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,809
That was fun.

346
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:15,530
That was pretty fun.

347
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:26,489
It's on rails.

348
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:38,059
I can do that too.

349
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,719
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

350
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,519
I can actually play.

351
00:38:43,559 --> 00:39:00,659
This way?

352
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:01,159
Down?

353
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:15,940
This is kind of a pathetic Jedi.

354
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,739
If you can't take one droid with a stick,

355
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,219
you probably need to go back to school.

356
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:40,789
All right, those guys have armor.

357
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,130
I'll handle this.

358
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:59,769
He's coming in.

359
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,679
That arm looks like it's going to explode.

360
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:11,480
Not bad.

361
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,840
That was like, just let me walk through.

362
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Like, did you really have to have that?

363
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,860
Yeah.

364
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,969
Here comes boss, I think.

365
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:35,769
Oh, Chewbacca.

366
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,369
Chewbacca is dead.

367
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:39,539
Oh, shit.

368
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,300
Chewie.

369
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,800
No.

370
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:59,099
He got shot like right in the head.

371
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,219
Oh, that was terrible.

372
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:06,940
That was awful.

373
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,860
That's not canon.

374
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,659
This is one of these expanded universes.

375
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,400
It's like somebody just, like, knocked him up.

376
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,800
Go on, get in there, Chewie.

377
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,420
They're all, they're, all right.

378
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,460
It's by their own movies.

379
00:41:52,739 --> 00:42:00,409
How did you figure eight?

380
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,199
Figure eight.

381
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:04,179
Figure eight.

382
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,230
I, I, my brain can't do it when I hear this sound.

383
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,900
I didn't do anything.

384
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,539
I just stood behind and just, I just looked like I was doing something.

385
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,380
We were all carrying the sofa, like six of us,

386
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,300
and I was just putting my fingertips on him, attending.

387
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,739
Where's my lightsaber?

388
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,539
Oh, right.

389
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:12,090
He's all right.

390
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,369
He's all right.

391
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:13,929
He's okay.

392
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,989
He's gonna be fine.

393
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,300
I actually have to do this.

394
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,340
That's actually part of what I have to do.

395
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,460
No, I'm gonna get an ice cream, mom.

396
00:43:47,159 --> 00:44:13,349
This is how actors look, right?

397
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:15,190
This is, all right, I just, like, kill skull.

398
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,050
The actors just do this shit in front of a green screen.

399
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,050
They just, in action, and they just go like this.

400
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,059
And then, like, six million dollars worth of CG.

401
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,579
And editing goes into that and makes it look, it makes it look awesome.

402
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,659
Go look at any behind the scenes for the many movies

403
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:38,260
you've ever seen in your whole life that had action in it.

404
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,739
It's like this.

405
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,300
It's, it doesn't even look real.

406
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,099
Like, then all the millions of dollars that make it, like,

407
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,099
fuck, fly everywhere, it's ridiculous.

408
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:51,579
What do I do?

409
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:11,190
Now what?

410
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,210
Oh, John just barely made it.

411
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:17,659
Did I get it?

412
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,119
John, look it.

413
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,440
Look at the actor and look at, look at the action, right?

414
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:24,940
I told you.

415
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:57,750
She just, she just killed, like, five people on our team.

416
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,190
Just saying.

417
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,280
I think I missed my opportunity.

418
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,119
I think I missed the opportunity.

419
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,400
Why am I jogging?

420
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,519
Big rates, big rates.

421
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,719
I gotta, I gotta stop thinking about it.

422
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:42,920
I fuck it up every time I think about it.

423
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,730
Let me get one.

424
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,170
That was on her.

425
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,130
That wasn't even on me.

426
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,769
That was on her.

427
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:16,809
She missed that one.

428
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:29,590
I just saved your life.

429
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:31,519
Turn around.

430
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:33,849
Are you fucking serious?

431
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,980
I need to get inside the ship to destroy the core.

432
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,739
Hold them off as long as you can.

433
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,690
I'm gonna accept the thermal detonator.

434
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,460
I can't wait till the fucking music goes.

435
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:27,780
How the fuck do I go over there?

436
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,840
Yeah.

437
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,230
Hey, that's low.

438
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:29,139
They didn't do anything.

439
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:51,159
Whew.

440
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,039
Why flip?

441
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,239
Why not just leap?

442
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:55,719
Why not, like, step over and land safely?

443
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:56,760
Why flip?

444
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,199
You can't see where the fuck you're landing.

445
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:10,260
Imagine trusting the fact that you're gonna do a full rotation and land on your feet.

446
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,210
You just don't.

447
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,940
You just miscalculate when you're going forward.

448
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,059
You just land on your back.

449
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,989
That's when, like, baseball players, like, do something stupid

450
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,670
and they end up on the, I mean, like, the disabled list

451
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,949
for, like, 15, 30 days.

452
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,869
That's the type of shit that you do when you're a Jedi.

453
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:27,989
You end up on the fucking DL.

454
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:32,329
Yeah.

455
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:40,539
They have to have a list, guys.

456
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,039
Really?

457
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:02,710
I can't wait till we transition to dancing.

458
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:15,880
I was gonna do a Chewie, but it might have been a really, really embarrassing Chewie.

459
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,239
Let's get started then.

460
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,280
Let me test it behind you.

461
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,320
Let me just test it and see.

462
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,840
As long as you don't see my face, I can do it.

463
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,579
As long as you don't look at me.

464
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:31,300
I know what you said.

465
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,980
I just didn't think it would happen this soon.

466
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,159
See, if it was in front of the camera, I would, I wouldn't, I would back out.

467
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,360
Lock it.

468
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:58,579
I can't wait till I fight Doc Vader.

469
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:05,030
How come nobody's ever decided to do the strangle to Doc Vader?

470
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:06,329
You know?

471
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,670
Why wouldn't Obi-Wan just stick to like this without strangling Doc Vader?

472
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:23,079
They both just, like, it's, it has a better grip at that point, I think.

473
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,320
Just do that to the Emperor.

474
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,360
What's he gonna do?

475
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,559
I will electrocute you.

476
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:32,280
Do the Doc Vader.

477
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,239
He'll, you got an old man by the throat.

478
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:37,880
He's not gonna be able to shoot you with electricity.

479
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,949
Fuck that, dude.

480
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:47,829
I would just, I would just, I would just stone cold stun people.

481
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:48,550
Like it was before.

482
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:53,079
You know, get him, like, round the neck like this and then, like, stun him.

483
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,590
And they would go, boom!

484
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,389
And they would launch you up.

485
00:52:58,389 --> 00:52:59,269
It would be fucking awesome.

486
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:09,369
Come on, let's go.

487
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:10,730
Now all of a sudden you don't want to.

488
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:26,510
Got it.

489
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:31,849
You and me.

490
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:33,130
You and me.

491
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,699
I just hit the lady behind me.

492
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,139
I just, like, right at the lady.

493
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:28,360
Just do that.

494
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
Like, you know, as a Jedi, you don't have mana.

495
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:34,039
Think about that.

496
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,119
These motherfuckers waste all their time learning how to sword fight, like, from the 1700s.

497
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,480
Just go like this and throw people off a cliff.

498
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,309
What's the, what, what's the point of that?

499
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,099
Just go like this and push a whole army off a fucking bridge.

500
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:56,179
Why would you even ever get in close for any reason?

501
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,820
This is tiring.

502
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,900
You get tired doing this shit for more than five minutes.

503
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:09,460
Yeah, I just gotta hold my hand out and just concentrate like I'm doing a fucking crossword puzzle

504
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,739
and I can throw somebody off a bridge?

505
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:47,210
The only thing I can think of that would be a problem in doing this is just the trope

506
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,570
in every single piece of media.

507
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:50,489
A slight nosebleed.

508
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,360
Oh no!

509
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,309
I did it too long.

510
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,869
I'll be fine in a second.

511
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,679
Why do they bleed from their eyes?

512
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,820
You really want to give some real gravity to that situation?

513
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,860
A blood out of the eyes.

514
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,300
And it's like blood.

515
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,420
Blink, blink, blink, red.

516
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,539
Blood in the eyes and you can't see.

517
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:26,519
Then it'll be like, whoa, shit, you don't want to do that.

518
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,610
You definitely want to do that shit for more than a minute.

519
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,239
You won't be able to see.

520
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,440
Oh shit, it's been 57 minutes.

521
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,719
We're supposed to be done in 30.

522
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:45,960
We're supposed to only give everyone these 30 minutes.

523
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:53,550
Oops.

524
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:58,250
It's me, I'm here.

525
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,329
Let me just finish this and then I'll do one dance.

526
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,329
Actually, you know, I can't do a dance.

527
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:02,809
Sorry, guys.

528
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:03,849
It's been 57 minutes.

529
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,969
I still don't understand that.

530
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:33,980
It's like, oh, chewy, chewy, chewy.

531
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:38,730
Chewy.

532
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:51,800
I'm way ahead.

533
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:57,800
Explosion.

534
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
An explosion launched me.

535
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,840
I didn't do that.

536
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,599
That was the explosion on my back.

537
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:20,699
Yeah, fuck that, man.

538
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,059
I would just get a suit of armor.

539
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:27,179
I would be in like a steel full suit of armor.

540
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,380
I just hold my hands out and throw it.

541
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,730
So that would be a caster.

542
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:50,469
That was more embarrassing for you than it was cool for me.

543
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:51,670
I will say.

544
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,400
Chewy, don't do it, Chewy.

545
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:29,099
What the fuck?

546
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:35,300
This stupid ass boy, Blaine.

547
00:59:37,539 --> 01:00:06,920
Am I good?

548
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,409
All right, I'm good.

549
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:11,639
Want a Jar Jar?

550
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:12,599
I can't do a Jar Jar.

551
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:19,130
What's that Chewy doing on the left?

552
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,519
This Chewy on the left, I think he has like sand in his eyes.

553
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:36,699
Let's make him think he did that.

554
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:41,619
This shit don't fucking do anything.

555
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,090
Signed me up.

556
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,110
Arties.

557
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:17,920
How's hair?

558
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:19,960
Controlled.

559
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,199
Although, might need to re-tie it up here.

560
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:28,710
Next, next.

561
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:29,210
Hold on.

562
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:33,420
I can't quit mid-game.

563
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:37,099
I'm gonna do this and then I'll dance for you guys.

564
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:43,579
I'll dance.

565
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,960
I need to get the boss.

566
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:49,400
It's Darth Vader.

567
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,880
He's the boss in every one of the video games.

568
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:54,730
It's not gonna be anybody else.

569
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:58,869
It's just gonna show up.

570
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,719
It's gonna be a one-on-one scenario.

571
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:09,530
Am I driving the...

572
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:24,900
How about you do something?

573
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:27,219
How about you do something?

574
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,320
I have to do the work for both of us?

575
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:39,780
I know that you just had your hands lightly on it.

576
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:55,760
Nice work.

577
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:08,280
You need to do a Chewy?

578
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:11,960
Does the lizard people have Chewy sounds?

579
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:41,030
What's that?

580
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:41,670
Darth Vader.

581
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:57,960
It's tricky.

582
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,230
Tricky here.

583
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:06,539
Grab somebody.

584
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:17,440
Alright, we're good.

585
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:23,710
Yeah!

586
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,480
Oh no, they must...

587
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,639
Oh, that went quick.

588
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:35,639
I don't wanna fucking stop.

589
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,139
I really don't.

590
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:45,599
Oh, shit.

591
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:46,099
God.

592
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,320
See you later.

593
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,840
That guy was expendable.

594
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:52,000
Ah, man.

595
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,500
I'm fine.

596
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,599
This is so stupid.

597
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:05,099
Did you tell me to duck?

598
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,619
Did it on instinct.

599
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:07,659
Put the saber down.

600
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:15,849
Easy.

601
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:16,349
Got it.

602
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:34,480
No, I'm fine, Xbox.

603
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:36,239
I need a full...

604
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:37,440
Ball...

605
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,559
Oh, I need three servings.

606
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,679
Oh, failed to pull the spring.

607
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:40,320
I'll be alright.

608
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,429
Oh, my God.

609
01:05:55,230 --> 01:06:14,199
We're good?

610
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:21,659
Was this supposed to happen?

611
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,610
It's like another part of the scene?

612
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,139
Uh, what do we do now?

613
01:06:43,179 --> 01:07:00,039
Get off!

614
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:04,760
Come on, get yours, hurry up!

615
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:17,500
When will it end?

616
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,920
When you hear, off camera...

617
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,260
And he steps in.

618
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:27,820
And he goes...

619
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,360
Here it comes.

620
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:43,840
The walk.

621
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,800
Five of his attacks.

622
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,760
And then, there'll be an explosion,

623
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,960
and then the anger and...

624
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,039
I'll take care of you next time.

625
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,760
Non-canon dickhead, and he'll just walk away.

626
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:20,800
This is a long chapter.

627
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,010
This is the Clone Wars.

628
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,649
That doesn't matter.

629
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:30,909
Think that matters?

630
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:36,350
Darth Vader could be eight right now,

631
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,510
and he's still gonna walk out like eight feet tall.

632
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,699
Oh, I get...

633
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:53,180
Where is the...

634
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:55,850
Oh, it's the twins!

635
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,409
This is...

636
01:08:56,409 --> 01:08:57,289
Now, this is a fight.

637
01:08:57,289 --> 01:08:58,170
This is the two twins.

638
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,069
Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum.

639
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:17,979
Oh, I got a...

640
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:35,289
First base.

641
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:35,789
Down.

642
01:09:36,729 --> 01:10:02,170
What was that?

643
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,039
How did he hit me?

644
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:16,329
How was he hitting me?

645
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:18,329
How was he hitting me?

646
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:49,449
All right, mine's down.

647
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,279
Oh, I have to...

648
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,319
Dance waiting room.

649
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:42,199
What was that?

650
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:44,840
I do hope your day has been an enjoyable one.

651
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:47,960
Your Wookie friend has been very diligent,

652
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,439
and I believe we are almost ready for takeoff.

653
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,619
Are you excited?

654
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:53,180
I don't know who this is.

655
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:53,979
I'm excited.

656
01:11:53,979 --> 01:11:54,699
This robot?

657
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:59,020
I am TC38, and I'm very pleased to meet you.

658
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:01,819
Welcome aboard the Star Runner.

659
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:05,529
Oh, I'm very sorry.

660
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,090
The power couplings seem to have failed.

661
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:11,130
That's enough.

662
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:11,689
Get out of the way.

663
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:24,170
Here comes Darth Maul.

664
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,460
They will not escape us.

665
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:47,079
Were those the twins with the masks?

666
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:47,579
Oh.

667
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,020
I did it.

668
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,579
Oh, God, no.

669
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:57,930
Looks like a welcoming party.

670
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:00,199
It's friends of yours.

671
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:01,399
Is there a chapter selective,

672
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,960
or am I just playing through the whole game without knowing?

673
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,920
I believe your friends...

674
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:09,840
I believe Chewbacca would like you to take up the main guns.

675
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,479
We're not friends.

676
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:13,600
Because he's quite occupied trying to activate the hyperdrive.

677
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,720
I am going through the whole game.

678
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,609
It's been some time since we've been serviced.

679
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:20,890
Stop, stop, stop.

680
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:21,529
What, and what...

681
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:24,649
I'm having a fun time.

682
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:30,829
I think you should man the ship and hurry.

683
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:33,550
Everybody wants to see the fucking meme dances so bad.

684
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:58,909
Abort mission.

685
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:03,689
Abort mission.

686
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:08,510
You want to dance?

687
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,229
Fine.

688
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:10,029
I'll give you a dance.

689
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:21,609
Dance.

690
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,420
The Millennium Falcon's gone, so it doesn't matter.

691
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,359
How do I get this in...

692
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:42,250
Did I do it?

693
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:46,590
I can't get out of here.

694
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,109
I can't leave.

695
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:53,520
I can't leave.

696
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:57,500
Exit game.

697
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:03,159
I'm stuck here.

698
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:03,640
I can't leave.

699
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,119
Lift your right arm.

700
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:07,239
That's to join, isn't it?

701
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

702
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,470
Should I...

703
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:17,039
I don't think I can get out of here.

704
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:26,460
Xbox.

705
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,100
Main menu.

706
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:32,060
Xbox.

707
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:32,460
Exit.

708
01:15:33,260 --> 01:16:10,329
Connect Star Wars Walkthrough Part 45.

709
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:11,449
End of walkthrough.

710
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:13,689
We didn't want to switch.

711
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:14,250
I'm not switching.

712
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,329
I just did the only thing I knew how to get out of there.

713
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,369
We're going to do the thing.

714
01:16:19,369 --> 01:16:20,170
This thing.

715
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:20,890
You're going to go...

716
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:34,170
Don't tell me they never gave you what you want, you know?

717
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:48,840
I got to give people what they want.

718
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,949
I'm going to go like this.

719
01:16:52,670 --> 01:17:03,359
I'm going to be the first idiot to hurt themselves

720
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,439
playing this stupid Kinect game.

721
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:07,600
I'm going to like trip trying to be a funny guy

722
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,159
and I'm going to like...

723
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,840
Like run in the wall.

724
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,770
Up to do be careful.

725
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,609
Master Luke has best insisted that we...

726
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:16,170
Louder!

727
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,000
Did I corrupt my save?

728
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,960
No, please.

729
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,079
This is a very important site.

730
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:23,359
Did did did did did did did did!

731
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:23,680
Yes!

732
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,000
Stop!

733
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,119
Care less if you...

734
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,960
Oh, hello AMC 3PO.

735
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,680
Human-Cyborg relations at your surface.

736
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,359
Master Luke said we would meet you here.

737
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:43,609
You've been recognized.

738
01:17:43,609 --> 01:17:44,810
So I continue to play?

739
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,770
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

740
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:46,729
All right, here we go.

741
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:57,880
I have both lightsabers and shit and everybody wants to spree you.

742
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,439
There it is.

743
01:17:58,439 --> 01:17:59,000
Slot one.

744
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,710
Oh, yes, R2.

745
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,069
We're all eager to get going.

746
01:18:05,069 --> 01:18:06,350
I think I bit my cheek.

747
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,680
Yeah, I bit my cheek, I think.

748
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,640
I think the stream...

749
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,520
I have to leave.

750
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,079
Oh, oh, stream over, I think.

751
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,420
Dear, this archive appears to have been merged

752
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,739
with a Torgian Entertainment's dispatch.

753
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,260
It's completely corrupted.

754
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:23,579
Still...

755
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,699
I have a hangnail right here.

756
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,579
...sometimes prove...

757
01:18:25,579 --> 01:18:26,939
Ooh, ow, ow, ooh.

758
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:27,739
...should we take a little look?

759
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:28,779
I can't stream today.

760
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,619
I'm sorry, guys, I can't.

761
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,079
Here we are, Commander.

762
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:35,640
Ready to go.

763
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,760
Song title.

764
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,880
Who am I going to play as?

765
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,640
I guess I'm going to be...

766
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:51,399
I can't be the stormtrooper?

767
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:53,399
Of course I know what I'm talking about, R2.

768
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:56,199
In fact, there are several afterimports of documentation

769
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,199
based entirely on that routine.

770
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,199
And I would have unlocked it.

771
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,199
How do I get a layup?

772
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,340
I would have gotten one of these characters.

773
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,539
Wrong story.

774
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:13,399
You know, I don't know why you're here, R2.

775
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:15,399
Isn't there something that needs fixing somewhere?

776
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:19,640
Well, then, be quiet while the Commander thinks.

777
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,640
Song title.

778
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,640
I'm afraid we can't do anything.

779
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:35,289
I'm afraid we can't offer any advice.

780
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:37,289
I've never been fitted with a strategy chip.

781
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:39,289
And R2's broke a long time ago.

782
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:43,289
Well, I wouldn't call those good decisions, R2.

783
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:47,289
It's a miracle we even survive some of your decisions.

784
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:51,289
There, there, there, there, there, there, that one, there.

785
01:19:51,289 --> 01:19:53,289
Wait, what do you mean, there? Han Solo?

786
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:57,600
Oh, yeah, this is an app. I know. People love this one.

787
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
It's a continual fascination to me

788
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
that simple, repetitive audio output

789
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,600
and the varying decibels of...

790
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,600
Enjoy a VOD.

791
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,029
People that are watching the VOD,

792
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:10,029
have a great rest of your night.

793
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:27,689
I'll see you next time.

794
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,470
I'm going to go all out for this, though.

795
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,470
If you think for you, I'm just going to be like,

796
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,470
oh, funny. No, I'm fucking going to do this.

797
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,470
Stick it as hard as I can.

798
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:56,350
Right?

799
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,350
That was a pretty good one.

800
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,350
You looked the part, but let's see some of your moves.

801
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,350
I haven't seen this.

802
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:16,859
Never done this before.

803
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,680
But I answered to ain't a picture in the palace

804
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,680
No

805
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,680
And since the carbonite's off me

806
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,680
I'm living life now that I'm free

807
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,680
Yeah

808
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Told me get myself together

809
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,680
Now I got myself together

810
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,680
Now I made it through the weather

811
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,680
Better days are going to get better

812
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,680
I'm so happy

813
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,680
The carbonite is gone

814
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,560
Who dances like this?

815
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:20,479
Solo, solo

816
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:22,479
Picking up my plants to put in all my

817
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,479
Ow, I hit those. I can't hit a song.

818
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:26,479
I'm solo

819
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:28,479
I'm hunting solo

820
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:30,479
I'm hunting solo, solo

821
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,000
Solo, solo

822
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I'm hunting solo, solo

823
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:45,770
I'm hunting solo, solo

824
01:22:45,770 --> 01:23:00,039
I'm hunting solo

825
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:02,039
It feels so good

826
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:04,039
Stop feeling misunderstood

827
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:06,039
Back in the game, who knew I would

828
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:08,039
So flat, time I spread my wings

829
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:10,039
Loving myself makes me want to sing

830
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:12,039
Loving myself makes me want to sing

831
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:15,119
No more

832
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:17,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

833
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:19,119
Told me get myself together

834
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,119
Now I got myself together

835
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:23,119
Now I made it through the weather

836
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:25,119
Better days are going to get better

837
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:27,119
I'm so happy

838
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:29,119
The carbonite is gone

839
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,079
A movie that is over now

840
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:42,300
A movie that is over now

841
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,300
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

842
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,300
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

843
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,300
They look like a star

844
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,300
You can't stop my shine

845
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,300
I'm loving class city, my head is in the sky

846
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,300
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

847
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,300
I'm hunting solo

848
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,300
I'm hunting solo, solo

849
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,119
That's a lot of money, thanks a lot man

850
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:40,710
So I can do it again?

851
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:44,329
Advanced? I can't do advanced yet

852
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:48,079
Alright, I'm getting five stars

853
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:54,779
Of course I know what I'm talking about R2

854
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:57,779
In fact, there are several outer rim forms of communication

855
01:25:57,779 --> 01:25:59,779
Based entirely on dance routines

856
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:47,880
Cloud City is always looking for new talent

857
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,880
You think you have what it takes?

858
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,960
Like a star, you keep my shine

859
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,630
I'm cloud city, my head is in the sky

860
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,630
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

861
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,630
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

862
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,630
Solo

863
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:21,630
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight

864
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,630
Finally feeling free and it feels alright

865
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:26,630
Oh, time to do the things I like

866
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,630
Gonna see your princess, everything's alright

867
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:31,630
Oh, no job or to answer to

868
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,630
Ain't a fixture in the palace zoo

869
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:36,630
No, and since the carbonite's off me

870
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:38,630
I'm living life now that I'm free

871
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:41,630
Trying to get myself together

872
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,630
Now I got myself together

873
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,630
Now I made it through the weather

874
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,630
Better days are gonna get better

875
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,630
I'm so happy the carbonite is gone

876
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:57,560
Happy that it's over now

877
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
The pain is gone

878
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,819
I'm ashamed to cover up my eyes

879
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:04,439
I'm jumping in my ride tonight

880
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:06,439
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

881
01:28:06,439 --> 01:28:08,439
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

882
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:09,439
Solo

883
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:12,439
I'm picking up my plaster, putting it on my sign

884
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:14,880
I'm jumping in my falcon, put my sign

885
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,880
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

886
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,880
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

887
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
Solo

888
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:24,079
Solo

889
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:25,079
Did I get it wrong?

890
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:47,970
What am I talking about?

891
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,970
Why should you join me in life?

892
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:50,970
It feels so good

893
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,970
Oh, stop feeling misunderstood

894
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,970
Back in the game, who knew?

895
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:58,680
I was spraying my wings

896
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,680
Loving myself makes me wanna sing

897
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,920
Oh, yeah

898
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,920

899
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,920
Told me to get my act together

900
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,920
Now I got my act together

901
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:11,920
Yeah

902
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,920
Now I made it through the weather

903
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,920
Better days are gonna get better

904
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,289
I'm so happy the carbonite is gone

905
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:24,880
I'm so happy that it's over now

906
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,880
The pain is gone

907
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,630
I'm ashamed to cover up my eyes

908
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:30,630
I'm jumping in my ride tonight

909
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,630
I'm getting down tonight

910
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:33,630
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

911
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,630
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

912
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:36,630
Solo

913
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,630
I feel like a star, you can't stop my shine

914
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:41,630
I'm loving plasticity, my head's in the sky

915
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,630
I'm solo, I'm hunting solo

916
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:45,630
I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo

917
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,630
Solo

918
01:29:51,340 --> 01:30:11,909
Shit!

919
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:13,909
Ripping stuff off the wall

920
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:37,479
Retro...

921
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,479
Okay, I got advanced difficulty

922
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:40,479
That's not how I'm gonna be able to do that

923
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:55,380
Do I get more points?

924
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,380
I can only do this song like one more time

925
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,380
before people start to hear it in their sleep

926
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,380
Alright, this is it

927
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:04,729
Whatever happens, happens

928
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:05,729
And I'm moving on

929
01:31:05,729 --> 01:31:08,529
I'm so sorry

930
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:10,710
That it's gonna be over now

931
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,970
But we gotta move on

932
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:18,199
I feel like a star

933
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:20,329
Let's go!

934
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:22,329
Always knew the general solo was not to be trusted

935
01:31:22,329 --> 01:31:24,329
This final proves it

936
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:31,119
Was that... did I pick difficulty?

937
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:47,010
I didn't get the very difficulty

938
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,010
It's kinda casual

939
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:50,010
What's that?

940
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,010
I have to... I have to do that to fail, right?

941
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:54,010
I... I don't know how I get out of it

942
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:56,010
There's no way to get out

943
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:00,979
You can unlock Darth Vader singing this

944
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:03,949
Wait, there it is

945
01:32:03,949 --> 01:32:34,039

946
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:36,039
You can unlock alternate voice tracks

947
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:37,039
Keep up the good work, commander

948
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:39,039
We're really getting to the heart of this dictum

949
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:40,039
I'm not doing this one again

950
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:41,039
May I respectfully remind you

951
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,039

952
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:47,039

Alright, so it's that

957
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,500

It's different

965
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:37,359

02:19:09,379 --> 02:19:10,799
He thought that each one is an

1104
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:28,899
individual story. I like that.

1105
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:37,809
Oh god. Now, we got a tan guy.

02:19:37,809 --> 02:20:10,399

1107
02:20:10,459 --> 02:20:24,139
I don't have to carry my ball.

1108
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:30,440
Which one? No, I'm worried.

1109
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:43,940
What if I jumped and just went

1110
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,940
through the ground? Just like

1111
02:20:46,000 --> 02:21:00,059
here we go. Here we go. I want

1112
02:21:00,139 --> 02:21:08,399

02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:35,690
hundred hit combo. Let's go.

1114
02:21:35,750 --> 02:22:18,899
Let's go. What's this?

1115
02:22:18,920 --> 02:23:06,899
Good.

1116
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:12,209
Right here.

1117
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:17,729
This is done. This arm is done.

1118
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:21,319
I can't I can't I can't do it

1119
02:23:21,379 --> 02:23:41,670
anymore with this arm. When you

1120
02:23:41,729 --> 02:24:12,819
get this. This is fun. I need

1121
02:24:12,899 --> 02:24:25,629
like a like a stick.

1122
02:24:25,709 --> 02:24:39,649
Just be like. Next. You know,

1123
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:40,610
I'm like going like this. It's

1124
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:41,610
like just my arm's gonna throw

1125
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:45,610
my arm up. If I go like like

1126
02:24:45,670 --> 02:25:05,299
that.

1127
02:25:05,379 --> 02:25:32,049
Did I break it?

1128
02:25:32,129 --> 02:25:35,049
Now, not so tight this time.

1129
02:25:35,129 --> 02:25:36,069
Make sure you do it a little

1130
02:25:36,129 --> 02:25:41,829
looser. That's better. What

1131
02:25:41,889 --> 02:25:53,950
are you going to say about

1132
02:25:54,010 --> 02:26:08,840
that? I think it's time for me

1133
02:26:08,899 --> 02:26:11,840
to kick. It's time to kick your

1134
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:51,780
ass. It's **** up the sensor.

1135
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:52,780
It thinks my body's like three

1136
02:26:52,840 --> 02:27:13,670
times longer. What? What? Jerry?

1137
02:27:13,729 --> 02:27:15,670
You're gonna do it together.

1138
02:27:16,819 --> 02:27:20,709
Sorry. Sorry. How did you make

1139
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:21,709
it like this? Why couldn't you

1140
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:26,760
just do the command? Victory is

1141
02:27:26,819 --> 02:27:41,719
out. It's like the wrong way.

1142
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:44,110
The way you look at it. Like

1143
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:46,110
remember, I'm mirrored. Flame

1144
02:27:46,129 --> 02:27:58,610
badge. Flame badge. Next. I

1145
02:27:58,690 --> 02:28:00,610
gotta go refill that water and

1146
02:28:00,690 --> 02:28:02,629
right after this one. Go, go,

1147
02:28:02,690 --> 02:28:18,399
German Ranger. I'm trying. Why

1148
02:28:18,459 --> 02:28:30,260
would I want to get that on

1149
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:34,139
camera? Whatever. Your symbol

1150
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:48,709
tomorrow. Green tongue. Act today.

1151
02:28:48,770 --> 02:29:14,340
I have to use my right hand as

1152
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,340
a weapon because it's hard for

1153
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:17,340
me to do this now because I

1154
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:19,319
it's my I'm losing circulation

1155
02:29:19,379 --> 02:29:21,319
here. I'm gonna pick up my

1156
02:29:21,379 --> 02:29:24,319
right hand and use it like this

1157
02:29:24,379 --> 02:29:27,840
because I have no strength.

1158
02:29:27,899 --> 02:29:45,479
That works. He's weak. Weak.

1159
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:46,479
I've been in the middle of an

1160
02:29:46,559 --> 02:29:48,479
exercise for two and a half

1161
02:29:48,559 --> 02:30:14,870
hours. I can't do it. I have to

1162
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:43,059
chase him. Oh no. I dodged it.

1163
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:44,059
Why would you step in? It's

1164
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:51,709
gonna double tap. You idiot. A

1165
02:30:51,770 --> 02:31:22,139
car. Turn off the power. Alright,

1166
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:37,920
here we go. Lights are off. Oh

1167
02:31:37,920 --> 02:32:03,409
**** You saw me, dog. Here we

1168
02:32:03,469 --> 02:32:10,670
go. Stop. Activate. Quit

1169
02:32:10,729 --> 02:32:14,639
looking at him. Run after him.

1170
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:35,629
Boss. Alright, let's go. Three

1171
02:32:35,709 --> 02:32:42,309
three. Fight. I don't have a

1172
02:32:42,389 --> 02:32:44,309
uh I don't have power up yet.

1173
02:32:44,389 --> 02:32:55,020
Let's do this thing. Oh, he's

1174
02:32:55,079 --> 02:33:00,899
snoring.

1175
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:11,440
Don't go in. Now, wait. Don't

1176
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:19,209
get hit. Back up. Back up. Back

1177
02:33:19,270 --> 02:33:20,209
up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

1178
02:33:21,899 --> 02:33:24,629
I can't get hit by this. This

1179
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:30,260
way is he gonna go? Left or

1180
02:33:30,319 --> 02:33:37,170
right? He's doing it again? I

1181
02:33:37,229 --> 02:33:39,170
can't. Get over there. Get over

1182
02:33:39,229 --> 02:33:58,840
there you **** idiot. That's

1183
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:45,639
good. Thank god it's the

1184
02:34:45,719 --> 02:34:47,639
children. I thought that was

1185
02:34:47,719 --> 02:34:48,659
another camera pointing at me.

1186
02:34:48,719 --> 02:34:50,659
I was like, who put a **** camera

1187
02:34:52,170 --> 02:34:57,549
in my room? It was like facing

1188
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,549
me this way. I was like, why is

1189
02:34:59,549 --> 02:35:07,639
that? Inferno badge. No uh

1190
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:14,440
Megazord? Next. Why would there

1191
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:15,440
be no Megazord? Uh after this

1192
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:23,159
one, we're gonna have to do a

1193
02:35:23,219 --> 02:35:43,079
uh I gave up. I don't have any

1194
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:45,569
energy to do that. Let me see

1195
02:35:45,649 --> 02:35:48,409
what I do. Uh that's what I do

1196
02:35:48,469 --> 02:35:50,409
with me. You know, that doesn't

1197
02:35:50,469 --> 02:35:51,409
do anything. That doesn't have

1198
02:35:51,469 --> 02:35:53,409
any powers. It's just what they

1199
02:35:53,469 --> 02:35:55,409
chose to do for that particular

1200
02:35:55,469 --> 02:35:58,370
reason. They chose to go like

1201
02:35:58,450 --> 02:36:00,389
this. It doesn't mean that I'm

1202
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:01,389
not as strong. It's just weak.

1203
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:07,110
That doesn't do anything. That's

1204
02:36:07,170 --> 02:36:14,850
just for show. Let's get that

1205
02:36:14,909 --> 02:36:16,850
clear. Alright, so it's not this

1206
02:36:16,909 --> 02:36:21,409
way. It's this way, right? I'm

1207
02:36:21,469 --> 02:36:31,520
gonna try to get a first try.

1208
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:57,459
Go, go Samurai.

1209
02:36:57,540 --> 02:37:00,229
I don't even know you can dump

1210
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:33,770
with the Megazord. Pink Ranger

1211
02:37:33,829 --> 02:37:40,940
screwed that up. Not very good

1212
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:53,610
this time. Victory is ours. What

1213
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:55,610
an awesome show that this was.

1214
02:37:55,670 --> 02:38:01,739
Well, that was great. I love

1215
02:38:01,799 --> 02:38:05,739
that. I love that. I love this

1216
02:38:05,819 --> 02:38:18,030
one. The show was bad. Why do

1217
02:38:18,090 --> 02:38:22,479
you say that? Uh I messed up.

1218
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:24,479
BitSlave gave ten community

1219
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:26,479
subs earlier. Thank you BitSlave.

1220
02:38:26,540 --> 02:38:29,479
So this. Ooh that was like 30

1221
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:31,479
minutes ago. Whoops. I am a

1222
02:38:31,540 --> 02:38:33,479
idiot but thank you for the ten

1223
02:38:33,479 --> 02:38:38,110
subs. Dropping ten subs tonight.

1224
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:40,280
Today. Whatever time it is. Let's

1225
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:42,280
do one more. Last one. The

1226
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:47,920
original show was great. I grew

1227
02:38:47,979 --> 02:38:49,920
up on that show. They had like

1228
02:38:49,979 --> 02:38:53,950
inside that the like the the

1229
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:54,950
Honker Burger, right? They did

1230
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:55,950
that the restaurant they would

1231
02:38:56,030 --> 02:38:57,950
eat and hang out and the the

1232
02:38:58,030 --> 02:38:58,969
American actors only record us

1233
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:00,969
the inside the restaurant scenes

1234
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:04,969
and like reactions outside. Please

1235
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:17,600
stop hurting me. It's time to

1236
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:20,600
finish this. I dodged it.

1237
02:39:20,659 --> 02:39:27,229
Go go samurai. Write your symbol

1238
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:54,819
tomorrow. Do it. Let it go.

1239
02:39:54,879 --> 02:40:13,420
That's like on a wedding fucking

1240
02:40:13,479 --> 02:40:15,420
photographer. What the fuck are

1241
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:17,420
you doing? You got it when like

1242
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:18,420
drunk Uncle Frank was forward?

1243
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:20,420
Not when he was like juggling

1244
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:38,159
upside down? God damn it. I was

1245
02:40:38,219 --> 02:40:39,159
gonna go straight up in the air

1246
02:40:39,219 --> 02:40:40,159
but like literally you would

1247
02:40:40,219 --> 02:40:42,159
have just like my my fucking

1248
02:40:42,219 --> 02:40:43,159
reverse upper body underwear

1249
02:40:43,159 --> 02:40:51,090
would have come up. The T-Pose.

1250
02:40:51,149 --> 02:40:53,090
The T-Pose. A little blood like

1251
02:40:53,149 --> 02:40:56,000
brush to my head. I don't know

1252
02:40:56,059 --> 02:40:57,000
how people stay upside down for

1253
02:40:57,059 --> 02:41:08,450
that one. Alright, last one and

1254
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:09,450
then I'm gonna get some water

1255
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,450
and we're gonna move on to a

1256
02:41:10,510 --> 02:41:13,450
relaxing one. Today, you will

1257
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:15,450
fall to my sword with my sword.

1258
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:17,469
They come up. Oh, that's such a

1259
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:21,469
strong right input. Jump.

1260
02:41:38,409 --> 02:41:42,350
Excellent. That's kinda cool.

1261
02:41:44,489 --> 02:41:55,299
Watch it. Let's dodge it. Yeah,

1262
02:41:55,360 --> 02:42:20,010
there we go. Can I get in? No.

1263
02:42:20,069 --> 02:42:21,010
There comes a bottom slash,

1264
02:42:21,069 --> 02:43:04,979
right? Okay, we're good.

1265
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:05,979
Searching for the project. What?

1266
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:13,260
I can't hear him. Let's do this

1267
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:16,139
please.

1268
02:43:18,219 --> 02:43:25,479
Connect is broken. The connect

1269
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:43,000
is broken. It doesn't work.

1270
02:43:43,059 --> 02:43:44,000
This guy says yes. I got the

1271
02:43:44,079 --> 02:44:32,079
wrong calibration. Get out of

1272
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:52,319
here. I gotta recalibrate the

1273
02:44:52,379 --> 02:44:55,319
head. Water. Retie this.

1274
02:44:55,379 --> 02:44:58,319
Splash, splash. Moisturize.

1275
02:44:58,379 --> 02:45:01,200
Dump like a cup of water down my

1276
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:08,260
pants. See? That's bullshit. I'm

1277
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:09,260
not even getting the points on

1278
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:29,379
my ID. I got fired. I got

1279
02:45:29,459 --> 02:45:35,399
recast. Re, uh, casting call.

1280
02:45:35,479 --> 02:45:45,760
Interesting. You want some?

1281
02:45:45,819 --> 02:45:48,829
I was trying to use last

1282
02:45:48,889 --> 02:45:52,829
weekend. Go, go Samurai. Okay.

1283
02:45:52,909 --> 02:45:59,719
Write your symbol tomorrow. No,

1284
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:17,659
no, no, no, no. I ain't doing

1285
02:46:17,719 --> 02:46:39,420
another one. Q-R-N-T-U-V. Hey,

1286
02:46:39,479 --> 02:46:44,159
we're back. He said the line.

1287
02:46:44,219 --> 02:46:45,850
He did. Sometimes he does. All

1288
02:46:45,930 --> 02:46:46,850
right, here we go. Let me get

1289
02:46:46,930 --> 02:46:53,590
the piece of water. I'll be back

1290
02:46:53,649 --> 02:46:54,590
in like two minutes, three

1291
02:46:54,649 --> 02:46:56,590
minutes. I'm gonna go pee.

1292
02:46:56,649 --> 02:47:01,750
Please do Q-R-S again. I can't.

1293
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:07,280
That was a night that will, I

1294
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:08,280
could never do that again, I

1295
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:10,299
don't think. It was just, I

1296
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:13,780
can't replicate that ever

1297
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:18,909
again. I can try to emulate the

1298
02:47:18,969 --> 02:47:20,909
thing. Like, oh, it's not, no

1299
02:47:20,969 --> 02:47:24,979
way. I can't emulate that.

1300
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:30,489
Sweat check. It's all right. I

1301
02:47:30,549 --> 02:47:31,489
mean, I'm a little, I'm a

1302
02:47:31,549 --> 02:47:33,489
little, I got some film on me

1303
02:47:33,569 --> 02:47:35,530
but it's fine. I'll be right

1304
02:47:35,610 --> 02:47:37,530
back. We're gonna do, we're

1305
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:40,020
gonna chill out. We're gonna do

1306
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:46,790
a slow paced one. See you in a

1307
02:47:46,850 --> 02:52:08,850
minute. I'm back. Okay. So,

1308
02:52:08,909 --> 02:52:11,350
we've done a little, we've done

1309
02:52:11,409 --> 02:52:13,350
some intensity. I think it's

1310
02:52:13,430 --> 02:52:16,350
time to do something where we

1311
02:52:16,430 --> 02:52:19,799
just hang out and get through

1312
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:22,799
one of these more relaxed ones.

1313
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:31,340
Family Feud? No. Far worse.

1314
02:52:31,399 --> 02:52:43,899
It's not Disney again. I

1315
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:55,629
promise. I redid the hair.

1316
02:52:55,690 --> 02:52:57,629
Splash some water. I dumped a

1317
02:52:57,709 --> 02:53:00,899
whole soda down here. Right.

1318
02:53:00,979 --> 02:53:06,780
Probably should put this in.

1319
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:10,600
This Bluetooth headset actually

1320
02:53:10,659 --> 02:53:12,600
goes pretty far. I can hear

1321
02:53:12,659 --> 02:53:14,840
everything you guys are saying.

1322
02:53:14,899 --> 02:53:17,899
Some of them are more nice than

1323
02:53:17,959 --> 02:53:18,899
other room comments. Speaking

1324
02:53:18,979 --> 02:53:29,870
of not being able to hear

1325
02:53:29,950 --> 02:53:30,870
things, why can I not hear it

1326
02:53:30,950 --> 02:53:35,370
now? Power off. What do you mean

1327
02:53:35,450 --> 02:53:48,260
power off? What do you mean

1328
02:53:48,319 --> 02:53:50,260
power off? Hold up your arm and

1329
02:53:50,319 --> 02:53:52,260
wave at the screen to begin.

1330
02:53:52,299 --> 02:54:04,420
Power on. Battery fully charged.

1331
02:54:04,479 --> 02:54:06,780
It's talking to me. I have my

1332
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:08,780
own like Iron Man suit in here.

1333
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:11,340
Okay, so Bluetooth connected.

1334
02:54:11,399 --> 02:54:15,639
Now, there we are. So, this is

1335
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:17,639
called Fantastic Pets and Where

1336
02:54:17,700 --> 02:54:19,639
to Find Them. Hopefully not in

1337
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:26,600
a movie theater if that series

1338
02:54:26,659 --> 02:54:30,440
is bad. Okay, welcome to the

1339
02:54:30,500 --> 02:54:33,440
game, Tender Dragoon 74. That

1340
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:43,809
was an easy joke. Continue with

1341
02:54:43,889 --> 02:54:46,829
this gamer profile. Hey there.

1342
02:54:46,889 --> 02:54:48,870
Welcome to the game. I told you

1343
02:54:48,930 --> 02:54:51,389
we were going to relax on this

1344
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:52,389
one. This is just for me to

1345
02:54:52,450 --> 02:54:53,389
catch my breath for like 12

1346
02:54:53,450 --> 02:54:55,389
minutes and then we'll play in

1347
02:54:55,450 --> 02:55:00,450
a horror game. This is you make

1348
02:55:00,510 --> 02:55:08,299
your own pet like a the one,

1349
02:55:08,379 --> 02:55:10,479
the thing in your hand. Visitor

1350
02:55:10,559 --> 02:55:13,760
detected. Hi there. I've been

1351
02:55:13,819 --> 02:55:14,760
expecting you. This is a

1352
02:55:14,819 --> 02:55:16,760
computer? Welcome to Dr.

1353
02:55:16,819 --> 02:55:18,760
Menagerie's house. I'm a natural

1354
02:55:18,819 --> 02:55:21,760
interface entity but you can

1355
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:23,760
call me Natalie. This house

1356
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:27,360
belongs to Dr. Menagerie. He's

1357
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:30,360
an expert in fantastic pets.

1358
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:33,540
Also, he's like splicing DNA. I

1359
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:35,540
probably should have mentioned

1360
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:36,540
that first. We got you got me

1361
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,540
like rolls here. He's in here

1362
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:39,540
right now but he left you a

1363
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:43,540
message. Cats, dogs, animals,

1364
02:55:43,620 --> 02:55:44,540
dragons of the same house in

1365
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:52,110
the same room. I imagine it must

1366
02:55:52,170 --> 02:55:54,110
stink in here. Hello. I don't

1367
02:55:54,170 --> 02:55:55,110
suppose you remember me but it

1368
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:57,110
has been a long time. I'm your

1369
02:55:57,129 --> 02:55:59,129
uncle, Dr. Menagerie. I'm a

1370
02:55:59,209 --> 02:56:01,129
doctor of zoology. That's the

1371
02:56:01,209 --> 02:56:02,149
study of how animals and humans

1372
02:56:02,209 --> 02:56:04,149
interact and live with each other.

1373
02:56:04,209 --> 02:56:05,149
It's fascinating work and it

1374
02:56:05,209 --> 02:56:07,149
takes me all over the world in

1375
02:56:07,209 --> 02:56:08,149
search of rare and fantastic

1376
02:56:08,209 --> 02:56:10,149
species which is why I'm

1377
02:56:10,209 --> 02:56:11,149
sending you this message. There

1378
02:56:11,209 --> 02:56:13,149
are loads of rare and exotic

1379
02:56:13,209 --> 02:56:15,149
animals living in my house and

1380
02:56:15,209 --> 02:56:17,149
I'm even. I'm afraid you're a

1381
02:56:17,229 --> 02:56:19,149
little too close. Try moving

1382
02:56:19,229 --> 02:56:22,739
back. So, head over to the

1383
02:56:22,819 --> 02:56:24,719
house and choose your first pet.

1384
02:56:24,780 --> 02:56:26,719
Oh, by the way, you'll meet

1385
02:56:26,780 --> 02:56:27,719
Natalie there. She'll help you

1386
02:56:27,799 --> 02:56:29,780
along. Can't he tell me that?

1387
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:32,780
Good luck. Just watch her on my

1388
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:35,780
shoulder. Why can't, why can't

1389
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:37,760
he just say, hey, back up? He

1390
02:56:37,819 --> 02:56:40,760
stops talking. Hey, hey, hey,

1391
02:56:40,819 --> 02:56:42,760
hey. Easy over there. You can

1392
02:56:42,819 --> 02:56:43,760
spend as long as you like with

1393
02:56:43,819 --> 02:56:45,760
each pet before choosing one to

1394
02:56:45,819 --> 02:56:47,760
take home with you. The door is

1395
02:56:47,819 --> 02:56:57,829
just open. We have all sorts of

1396
02:56:57,909 --> 02:56:59,829
pets here from cats, dogs,

1397
02:56:59,909 --> 02:57:02,809
ponies, and lizards to the rare

1398
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:05,870
and secret fantastic pets. These

1399
02:57:05,930 --> 02:57:06,870
are animals the rest of the

1400
02:57:06,930 --> 02:57:08,870
world doesn't know about like

1401
02:57:08,930 --> 02:57:13,860
dragons or unicorns. By the way,

1402
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:15,860
the reason you can't see me is

1403
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,860
that I'm a computer. I'm the

1404
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:19,860
house you're in, I suppose. It's

1405
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,860
my job to help your uncle look

1406
02:57:21,920 --> 02:57:22,860
after all the pets that decide

1407
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:24,860
to come home with him. This is

1408
02:57:24,940 --> 02:57:26,860
over there. Dragon like takes a

1409
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:28,860
dump in the corner. There's like

1410
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:32,760
puke in the corner, pee. Okay,

1411
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:35,840
let's go. On to the main event,

1412
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:41,739
the pet. Don't don't act like

1413
02:57:41,799 --> 02:57:42,739
that's not what would happen

1414
02:57:42,799 --> 02:57:46,840
here. What what a cruel little

1415
02:57:46,899 --> 02:57:47,840
grass you got. Look at your

1416
02:57:47,899 --> 02:57:48,840
carpets. That's why you got

1417
02:57:48,899 --> 02:57:52,659
hardwoods installed. The icons

1418
02:57:52,719 --> 02:57:53,659
you can see all over the street

1419
02:57:53,719 --> 02:57:55,659
are my movement system. With the

1420
02:57:55,719 --> 02:57:56,659
door open. They let me move

1421
02:57:56,739 --> 02:57:57,659
around the house with you.

1422
02:57:57,739 --> 02:57:59,659
There is probably like a shit

1423
02:57:59,739 --> 02:58:01,680
log hidden behind a lamp

1424
02:58:01,739 --> 02:58:02,680
somewhere in this house. So we

1425
02:58:02,739 --> 02:58:04,680
hold your hand out and a cursor

1426
02:58:04,739 --> 02:58:06,680
will appear on the screen. Now,

1427
02:58:06,739 --> 02:58:07,680
move that cursor over the

1428
02:58:07,739 --> 02:58:08,680
choice you'd like to have. Cat,

1429
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:12,780
dog, unicorn, or lizard? Lizard

1430
02:58:12,840 --> 02:58:18,690
pull. To help you choose, your

1431
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:19,690
uncle has left you a file on

1432
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:21,690
each of the pets that you can

1433
02:58:21,750 --> 02:58:26,170
choose to adopt. Oh, look at

1434
02:58:26,229 --> 02:58:29,170
him. Hello Nomad. Nomad joined

1435
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:30,170
us from the deserts of Africa

1436
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:32,149
where she spent her days sun

1437
02:58:32,209 --> 02:58:34,149
bathing. Apparently Nomad

1438
02:58:34,209 --> 02:58:35,149
decided to leave the desert

1439
02:58:35,209 --> 02:58:37,149
because she was fed up with sand

1440
02:58:37,209 --> 02:58:38,149
getting into everything. Oh,

1441
02:58:38,209 --> 02:58:40,149
that's so cute. Okay, I don't

1442
02:58:40,229 --> 02:58:42,149
know how to choose. Okay, let's

1443
02:58:42,309 --> 02:58:44,309
go. I need to get a prop on the

1444
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:47,350
house. This is Sadie. All right,

1445
02:58:47,409 --> 02:58:52,549
let's go to Sadie's store. Say

1446
02:58:52,610 --> 02:58:53,850
hello to one of our most

1447
02:58:53,909 --> 02:58:56,709
mischievous pets, Sadie. Sadie

1448
02:58:56,790 --> 02:58:58,090
loves to see what's going on

1449
02:58:58,149 --> 02:58:59,889
behind the scenes and to figure

1450
02:58:59,950 --> 02:59:01,629
out how things work. So she's

1451
02:59:01,690 --> 02:59:03,290
always getting into trouble.

1452
02:59:05,350 --> 02:59:07,469
That's on the leg. Okay, always

1453
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:13,430
getting into trouble. Let's get

1454
02:59:13,489 --> 02:59:20,010
out of here and out. Ember.

1455
02:59:20,030 --> 02:59:22,170
This is Ember, one of our

1456
02:59:22,229 --> 02:59:24,430
newest additions. She loves all

1457
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:26,909
types of extreme sports. Have

1458
02:59:26,969 --> 02:59:28,270
you ever seen a snowboarding

1459
02:59:28,329 --> 02:59:31,709
lizard? Just incredible. I like

1460
02:59:31,770 --> 02:59:34,899
the handstand. And the back

1461
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:36,399
flip. I did three of those when

1462
02:59:36,459 --> 02:59:37,399
the stream started. I think

1463
02:59:37,459 --> 02:59:38,299
that might be the one. We've

1464
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:47,750
got to get them all. Timmy.

1465
02:59:47,809 --> 02:59:49,950
Right next to the camera. Funny

1466
02:59:50,010 --> 02:59:53,930
star. It's the funny one.

1467
02:59:53,989 --> 02:59:55,629
Believe it or not, Timmy is one

1468
02:59:55,690 --> 02:59:57,569
of our shyest pets. He's a

1469
02:59:57,649 --> 02:59:59,329
little wary of new people, but

1470
02:59:59,389 --> 03:00:00,729
if you become friends, then

1471
03:00:00,790 --> 03:00:02,530
you'll never see a more loyal,

1472
03:00:02,590 --> 03:00:05,469
dedicated pet than Timmy.

1473
03:00:08,329 --> 03:00:11,340
Check out Drake. I don't think

1474
03:00:11,420 --> 03:00:12,120
it's going to be Timmy. I think

1475
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:17,000
it's going to be Ember. Ah, yes.

1476
03:00:17,079 --> 03:00:18,739
This is Drake, one of our

1477
03:00:18,799 --> 03:00:20,639
miniature dragons. He may be

1478
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:22,579
small, but he's still pretty

1479
03:00:22,639 --> 03:00:24,620
wild. Just watch him fend off a

1480
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:27,020
fearsome squeaky toy. It's

1481
03:00:27,079 --> 03:00:35,260
strong. Ember. I chose him.

1482
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:37,379
Handstand, back flips. It's

1483
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:41,709
going to be Ember. Ember's love

1484
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:43,450
of extreme sports has made her

1485
03:00:43,510 --> 03:00:45,770
completely fearless. Natalie

1486
03:00:45,850 --> 03:00:47,149
says that watching Ember's

1487
03:00:47,209 --> 03:00:49,809
stunning. Looks like you know

1488
03:00:49,889 --> 03:01:15,659
who's going to take home. It's

1489
03:01:15,719 --> 03:01:22,290
too easy. Wait. Yes. No. Hang

1490
03:01:22,350 --> 03:01:25,329
on. Nearly there. Hello. My

1491
03:01:25,389 --> 03:01:26,770
systems have transferred

1492
03:01:26,829 --> 03:01:29,770
perfectly. Ooh, nice place you've

1493
03:01:29,790 --> 03:01:32,549
got here. Very chic. Thank you.

1494
03:01:32,629 --> 03:01:34,329
Very chic. You like what I'm

1495
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:36,329
doing with here? I won't go.

1496
03:01:36,389 --> 03:01:55,950
Yes, I'd love to go. Remember I

1497
03:01:56,010 --> 03:01:57,250
told you. Remember I told you.

1498
03:01:57,309 --> 03:01:58,290
I told you. What did I fucking

1499
03:01:58,350 --> 03:02:00,190
tell you? What did I tell you?

1500
03:02:00,329 --> 03:02:02,030
You're too close. Remember I

1501
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:03,629
said about fucking CGI in movies

1502
03:02:03,690 --> 03:02:04,629
and how like the guy that boom

1503
03:02:04,690 --> 03:02:05,229
boom boom is not like an idiot

1504
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:05,969
and all of a sudden he has these

1505
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:07,069
spells? Check this out. Yes,

1506
03:02:07,129 --> 03:02:11,010
they definitely like it here.

1507
03:02:11,069 --> 03:02:12,510
Oh yes, I nearly forgot

1508
03:02:12,569 --> 03:02:14,610
something, which is ironic

1509
03:02:14,670 --> 03:02:17,110
considering I'm a computer.

1510
03:02:17,170 --> 03:02:19,250
This is Avatar, one of Dr.

1511
03:02:19,309 --> 03:02:22,010
Menagerie's assistants. Avatar

1512
03:02:22,090 --> 03:02:24,909
helps out by acting as my hands

1513
03:02:24,989 --> 03:02:26,290
because computers don't have

1514
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:31,030
the hands of their own, see?

1515
03:02:31,090 --> 03:02:32,489
Try calling your pet over to

1516
03:02:32,569 --> 03:02:35,069
you. You can do it just like you

1517
03:02:35,129 --> 03:02:37,329
would with a real pet. You see

1518
03:02:37,409 --> 03:02:38,770
how Avatar is showing you how

1519
03:02:38,829 --> 03:02:41,030
to call your pet over? Whenever

1520
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:43,309
you see perfect. Now you can

1521
03:02:43,370 --> 03:02:44,409
call your pet whenever you

1522
03:02:44,469 --> 03:02:45,750
like. This is in the room. There

1523
03:02:45,809 --> 03:02:47,149
are lots of other commands you

1524
03:02:47,209 --> 03:02:48,770
can give to your pet too. So

1525
03:02:48,850 --> 03:02:53,899
try plenty of things out. Now

1526
03:02:53,959 --> 03:02:56,059
let's try a toy, shall we?

1527
03:02:56,159 --> 03:02:56,959
Let's get a toy.

1528
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,420
Let's see.

1529
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:00,459
Aha, the bubble bubbler, I

1530
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:03,700
think. The bubble bubbler. Play

1531
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:05,200
with bubbles by popping and

1532
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:09,000
swirling them around. Pop the

1533
03:03:09,059 --> 03:03:16,340
bubbles? Three, two, one. Hey!

1534
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:18,280
Help me pop these. The more

1535
03:03:18,340 --> 03:03:19,719
bubbles the bubble bubbler

1536
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:23,799
creates. I don't want to. The

1537
03:03:23,860 --> 03:03:26,649
faster you move around, the

1538
03:03:26,709 --> 03:03:31,090
bubble bubbler creates. You're

1539
03:03:31,149 --> 03:03:32,090
going to get me in trouble. I'm

1540
03:03:32,110 --> 03:03:36,899
going to fall. Can you get one?

1541
03:03:36,959 --> 03:03:42,559
You get one too. These are mine.

1542
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:50,350
I'm destroying it. Did I get

1543
03:03:50,409 --> 03:03:57,489
food too? It makes the bubbler

1544
03:03:57,549 --> 03:04:02,719
release more bubbles. The bubble

1545
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:05,659
bubbler finished. All of the

1546
03:04:05,739 --> 03:04:06,799
activities will finish by

1547
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:08,540
themselves. So you don't need

1548
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:09,739
to tidy them away yourself.

1549
03:04:09,799 --> 03:04:15,340
I didn't even get one. It's just

1550
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:21,399
a baby. Hey. Hey there. What is

1551
03:04:21,459 --> 03:04:26,440
it? What's up? What's up, girl?

1552
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:32,079
What do you want to do? Hey. No,

1553
03:04:32,139 --> 03:04:33,680
you can't go that way. Back over

1554
03:04:33,739 --> 03:04:37,819
here. Hey, come here. Come over

1555
03:04:37,879 --> 03:04:45,360
here. Come over here. Come over

1556
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:51,819
here! Come over here. Come here.

1557
03:04:51,899 --> 03:05:02,899
Hey! Toys? Ball?

1558
03:05:02,959 --> 03:05:04,600
As you unlock more toys, they'll

1559
03:05:04,659 --> 03:05:06,399
appear here. To let me know what

1560
03:05:06,459 --> 03:05:08,040
you'd like to do, simply hold

1561
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:09,299
your hand out and a cursor will

1562
03:05:09,379 --> 03:05:11,040
appear on the screen. To select

1563
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:13,680
an icon simply hold your cursor

1564
03:05:13,739 --> 03:05:15,440
over it and I'll do the rest.

1565
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:17,420
That's not going to work. Let's

1566
03:05:17,479 --> 03:05:19,079
try a game of ball fetch, shall

1567
03:05:19,079 --> 03:05:25,319
Now we move the glowing cursor over the icon and hold it nice and still.

1568
03:05:25,319 --> 03:05:26,319
Ball fetch.

1569
03:05:26,319 --> 03:05:29,729
Right.

1570
03:05:29,729 --> 03:05:34,709
Time to give your pets some exercise in the game of ball fetch.

1571
03:05:34,709 --> 03:05:35,709
Ball fetch.

1572
03:05:35,709 --> 03:05:37,329
Where am I?

1573
03:05:37,329 --> 03:05:38,329
How do I take it?

1574
03:05:38,329 --> 03:05:44,399
Reach towards the screen to take the ball from your pet.

1575
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:49,120
The markers on the floor display how far your last throw and your longest throw went before

1576
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:50,120
the ball bounced.

1577
03:05:50,120 --> 03:05:51,120
Nice.

1578
03:05:51,120 --> 03:06:01,020
Alright, I'm going to throw it further.

1579
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:03,600
Here we go.

1580
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:04,600
Where did I go?

1581
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:08,079
I'm currently off.

1582
03:06:08,079 --> 03:06:09,079
I was on camera before in game and I'll be back.

1583
03:06:09,079 --> 03:06:10,079
How did I throw it further than that?

1584
03:06:10,079 --> 03:06:11,079
I'm trying to throw it over the fence.

1585
03:06:11,079 --> 03:06:12,079
I'm not going to be able to do that.

1586
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:13,079
I'll try.

1587
03:06:13,079 --> 03:06:14,079
I'm afraid you're a little too close.

1588
03:06:14,079 --> 03:06:15,079
Try moving back.

1589
03:06:15,079 --> 03:06:16,840
Just throw the ball for your pet.

1590
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:24,030
It looks like your pet is enjoying it.

1591
03:06:24,030 --> 03:06:25,030
Do it underhand?

1592
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:26,030
How did you know I was not doing it underhand?

1593
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:28,229
All fantastic pets love to play ball fetch.

1594
03:06:28,229 --> 03:06:29,229
That's cute.

1595
03:06:29,229 --> 03:06:30,229
Ball fetch finished.

1596
03:06:30,229 --> 03:06:36,399
Copy the gestures.

1597
03:06:36,399 --> 03:06:37,399
I'll try another one.

1598
03:06:37,399 --> 03:06:39,340
Ball fetch.

1599
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:40,340
That was cute.

1600
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:41,340
Ball fetch.

1601
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:47,670
I'm going to try to throw it over the fence.

1602
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:53,799
Is it underhand? How did you know I was not doing it underhand?

1603
03:06:53,799 --> 03:07:06,709
All fantastic pets love to play ball fetch.

1604
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:13,770
That is cute.

1605
03:07:13,770 --> 03:07:24,840
Ball fetch finished. Copy the gestures avatars performing to get your pet to do different things.

1606
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:40,969
So now you've got to know your pet a little. I guess it's time I told you about trainer's headquarters.

1607
03:07:42,149 --> 03:07:49,149
Trainer's headquarters is an organization that looks after the fantastic pets of the world through their trainers, like you.

1608
03:07:50,149 --> 03:07:56,149
If you're wondering why you've never heard of trainer's headquarters, it's because they're ultra mega top secret.

1609
03:07:57,149 --> 03:08:03,149
The organization isn't interested in fame and glory, only finding and caring for fantastic pets.

1610
03:08:03,149 --> 03:08:08,149
Fantastic pet trainers have ten different ranks, and at the moment you're rank one.

1611
03:08:09,149 --> 03:08:14,149
That's the lowest rank I'm afraid. But don't worry, I'm sure you won't be there for long.

1612
03:08:14,149 --> 03:08:19,149
You can increase your trainer rank by taking part in talent shows with your pet.

1613
03:08:19,149 --> 03:08:22,149
I'll explain more about talent shows later.

1614
03:08:31,209 --> 03:08:37,250
Clap your arms to make your pet fly.

1615
03:08:37,250 --> 03:08:38,250
Fly Ember, fly.

1616
03:08:42,729 --> 03:08:43,729
You gonna fly?

1617
03:08:45,229 --> 03:08:46,229
Excuse me.

1618
03:09:08,489 --> 03:09:09,489
Chaos emerald.

1619
03:09:12,180 --> 03:09:13,180
You seeing this?

1620
03:09:14,180 --> 03:09:15,180
Look at that.

1621
03:09:17,319 --> 03:09:18,319
That's really interesting.

1622
03:09:19,319 --> 03:09:20,319
What do you think about that?

1623
03:09:26,319 --> 03:09:27,319
Come here.

1624
03:09:28,319 --> 03:09:29,319
Come here.

1625
03:09:29,319 --> 03:09:30,319
I'll throw my legs.

1626
03:09:31,319 --> 03:09:32,319
I'll throw my legs.

1627
03:09:39,649 --> 03:09:44,090
What's on the tee?

1628
03:09:50,229 --> 03:09:55,399
It's a fancy way of selecting all sorts of other options and things to do in the game.

1629
03:09:55,399 --> 03:10:02,399
Your smartphone is in the opposite corner of the display from the toy box, and you open it in exactly the same way.

1630
03:10:02,399 --> 03:10:06,399
Just hold your arms straight out to the top left and wait a second.

1631
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:16,680
Get it.

1632
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:24,799
As you know, your uncle, Dr. Minazu, is away on an expedition.

1633
03:10:25,799 --> 03:10:26,799
How is this a super game?

1634
03:10:26,799 --> 03:10:28,799
But did you know that you get to choose where he visits next?

1635
03:10:29,799 --> 03:10:32,579
Where should he go?

1636
03:10:34,579 --> 03:10:35,579
Las Vegas.

1637
03:10:36,579 --> 03:10:37,579
Right there, Las Vegas.

1638
03:10:43,579 --> 03:10:44,579
I'm just trying to see.

1639
03:10:46,579 --> 03:10:47,579
Russia?

1640
03:10:49,579 --> 03:10:50,579
Australia?

1641
03:10:51,579 --> 03:10:52,579
You guys choose.

1642
03:10:54,579 --> 03:10:55,579
You guys pick.

1643
03:10:56,579 --> 03:10:57,579
Smart click.

1644
03:11:00,579 --> 03:11:03,579
Then Dr. Minazuri across the world to that continent.

1645
03:11:06,420 --> 03:11:08,420
Whoa, you're getting a little too close.

1646
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:10,420
Try taking a step back.

1647
03:11:11,420 --> 03:11:13,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, cancel.

1648
03:11:16,639 --> 03:11:21,530
Hold on.

1649
03:11:21,530 --> 03:11:22,530
Wait, wait, wait.

1650
03:11:22,530 --> 03:11:23,530
I need to get on here.

1651
03:11:23,530 --> 03:11:24,530
I'm afraid you're a little too close.

1652
03:11:25,530 --> 03:11:26,530
Try moving back.

1653
03:11:26,530 --> 03:11:27,530
All right.

1654
03:11:27,530 --> 03:11:28,530
Where are we going?

1655
03:11:28,530 --> 03:11:29,530
Ready?

1656
03:11:29,530 --> 03:11:41,190
Where?

1657
03:11:41,190 --> 03:11:42,190
All right.

1658
03:11:42,190 --> 03:11:43,190
It looks like we're going to.

1659
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:54,000
Oh, you want me to go to the, you want me to go to the frost area.

1660
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Frost?

1661
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
This looks like it's frost to me.

1662
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:59,000
Yeah, that's unanimous.

1663
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:01,000
Thanks for clicking.

1664
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:02,000
Forward.

1665
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:03,000
Whoa.

1666
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:04,000
You're getting a little too close.

1667
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:06,000
Try taking a step back.

1668
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:08,000
All right.

1669
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:36,489
How do we go there?

1670
03:12:36,489 --> 03:12:38,120
What are we going to get?

1671
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:40,120
Lost lizard of Antarctica.

1672
03:12:40,120 --> 03:12:41,120
Unlock with gems.

1673
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:45,440
It's just another lizard though.

1674
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:47,680
This is, I don't want, I don't want this.

1675
03:12:48,680 --> 03:13:05,200
Let it stay lost.

1676
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:17,649
Yes, terrible.

1677
03:13:17,649 --> 03:13:18,649
Australian.

1678
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:22,340
Horse.

1679
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:24,340
Yeah.

1680
03:13:24,340 --> 03:13:31,200
Hello.

1681
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:34,200
You'll be pleased to hear that my expedition is going well.

1682
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:38,200
I've discovered a very strange and wondrous new species of fantastic animals.

1683
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:40,200
None of which have ever been seen before.

1684
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:46,200
Although, between you and me, I'm beginning to suspect that one of them is just a pony in a funny hat.

1685
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:52,000
Thank you Bitslave for the 10 community subs.

1686
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,000
I already said that.

1687
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:54,000
I'm so stupid.

1688
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:55,000
Try moving back.

1689
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:57,000
But thank you though for it.

1690
03:13:58,879 --> 03:13:59,879
All right, so did I get that?

1691
03:13:59,879 --> 03:14:00,879
Okay, let's go.

1692
03:14:00,879 --> 03:14:01,879
The database awaits.

1693
03:14:01,879 --> 03:14:03,879
We're going to Australia.

1694
03:14:05,239 --> 03:14:07,239
Does that mean we're still going to be in my room?

1695
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:23,479
Welcome to the pet database.

1696
03:14:24,479 --> 03:14:27,479
This is where you get to decide how your pet evolves and changes.

1697
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:34,479
You can choose its size and color, whether it has wings or horns, and loads of other things.

1698
03:14:35,479 --> 03:14:39,909
Everything your pet uses up a few gems to start the pet database.

1699
03:14:39,909 --> 03:14:43,909
But once you're inside the database, you can make as many changes as you like.

1700
03:14:43,909 --> 03:14:44,909
Horns.

1701
03:14:44,909 --> 03:14:46,909
There are lots of different parts of your pet that you can change.

1702
03:14:48,909 --> 03:14:49,909
Red eyes.

1703
03:14:50,909 --> 03:14:51,909
Claws.

1704
03:14:51,909 --> 03:14:58,909
If you choose this, then all the changes you've made to your pet will be undone, and they won't look any different.

1705
03:14:58,909 --> 03:15:01,909
Choose this when you're happy with the changes you've made.

1706
03:15:02,909 --> 03:15:04,399
All right.

1707
03:15:04,399 --> 03:15:05,899
Let's do horns.

1708
03:15:06,899 --> 03:15:12,969
If you choose a pet with horns, it will be more confident and proud than one without.

1709
03:15:12,969 --> 03:15:14,969
Okay, I don't like one.

1710
03:15:14,969 --> 03:15:16,969
I don't even know what these look like.

1711
03:15:17,969 --> 03:15:28,680
Uh, no.

1712
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:32,010
Those are just little leaves.

1713
03:15:32,010 --> 03:15:35,920
Those are devil horns.

1714
03:15:35,920 --> 03:15:44,319
No.

1715
03:15:46,270 --> 03:15:50,450
Actually, I don't hate those.

1716
03:15:50,450 --> 03:15:51,450
I don't hate those.

1717
03:15:51,450 --> 03:15:52,450
All right.

1718
03:15:52,450 --> 03:15:53,450
No, I don't hate them.

1719
03:15:53,450 --> 03:15:59,170
Wings.

1720
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:02,819
Does your pet have a pair of wings?

1721
03:16:02,819 --> 03:16:03,819
Yes.

1722
03:16:03,819 --> 03:16:07,819
Wings make pets more carefree, and of course, they will be able to fly.

1723
03:16:08,819 --> 03:16:10,819
Those are like two can wings.

1724
03:16:12,819 --> 03:16:16,170
Those are bats.

1725
03:16:17,170 --> 03:16:19,670
I should have made Spyro the dragon.

1726
03:16:20,670 --> 03:16:22,670
Why did I not make Spyro?

1727
03:16:22,670 --> 03:16:32,719
All right, we're going to go with bat wings.

1728
03:16:32,719 --> 03:16:39,879
Yeah, that's cool.

1729
03:16:39,879 --> 03:16:47,120
Let's do the skin, the coat.

1730
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:51,120
Fantastic pets can be found all over the world.

1731
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:52,120
I can make Spyro.

1732
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:55,120
They have a huge range of skin types, textures, and patterns.

1733
03:16:56,120 --> 03:16:57,120
What does Spyro look like?

1734
03:16:57,120 --> 03:16:58,120
He's purple.

1735
03:17:05,819 --> 03:17:06,819
Purple and orange, right?

1736
03:17:07,819 --> 03:17:08,819
Are his legs orange?

1737
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:22,200
Purple and yellow.

1738
03:17:22,200 --> 03:17:23,200
Purple and yellow.

1739
03:17:23,200 --> 03:17:24,950
Your tooth place.

1740
03:17:25,950 --> 03:17:27,950
Are his feet orange?

1741
03:17:30,020 --> 03:17:31,020
I don't think so.

1742
03:17:35,840 --> 03:17:39,959
All right.

1743
03:17:39,959 --> 03:17:40,959
Very cool.

1744
03:17:40,959 --> 03:17:41,959
Let's do color.

1745
03:17:41,959 --> 03:17:50,049
Is this purple?

1746
03:17:54,299 --> 03:17:55,299
All right, nice.

1747
03:17:55,299 --> 03:17:56,299
That's Spyro the dragon.

1748
03:17:56,299 --> 03:17:59,309
Well, it's got to be a little lighter.

1749
03:18:00,309 --> 03:18:03,530
There it is.

1750
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:12,129
There it is.

1751
03:18:12,129 --> 03:18:32,440
Okay, what else can we do?

1752
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:35,959
This is pattern.

1753
03:18:36,959 --> 03:18:38,909
This is my favorite part.

1754
03:18:39,909 --> 03:18:41,909
You can choose the pet's colors and patterns,

1755
03:18:41,909 --> 03:18:44,909
and they will appear on whichever skin type you just picked.

1756
03:18:45,909 --> 03:18:46,909
It's just smooth, right?

1757
03:18:47,909 --> 03:18:48,909
Does it do anything?

1758
03:18:55,520 --> 03:19:09,370
That looks good.

1759
03:19:09,370 --> 03:19:13,680
Oh, yes.

1760
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:14,680
Very stylish.

1761
03:19:15,680 --> 03:19:16,680
All right, color.

1762
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:17,680
This is where we get it.

1763
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:18,680
It's orange, right?

1764
03:19:18,680 --> 03:19:19,680
No, that's correct.

1765
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:25,149
Eyes.

1766
03:19:25,149 --> 03:19:26,149
What does Spyro have for eyes?

1767
03:19:26,149 --> 03:19:27,149
Okay.

1768
03:19:27,149 --> 03:19:29,149
This is where you specify the pet's eyes.

1769
03:19:29,149 --> 03:19:30,149
Red.

1770
03:19:30,149 --> 03:19:32,149
Do you want them to be adorable or intense?

1771
03:19:33,149 --> 03:19:35,149
Awesome or just plain strange?

1772
03:19:39,180 --> 03:19:40,180
The yellow?

1773
03:19:40,180 --> 03:19:42,000
You're too close.

1774
03:19:45,280 --> 03:19:50,299
All right.

1775
03:19:50,299 --> 03:19:51,299
Oh, yes.

1776
03:19:51,299 --> 03:19:52,299
Very stylish.

1777
03:19:54,559 --> 03:19:55,559
Now what?

1778
03:19:55,559 --> 03:19:56,739
What is that?

1779
03:19:58,239 --> 03:19:59,239
A tail.

1780
03:19:59,239 --> 03:20:00,239
What's the emo?

1781
03:20:00,239 --> 03:20:03,239
Change the color of your pet's tail for a new look.

1782
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:05,409
No, orange is too darn.

1783
03:20:13,370 --> 03:20:16,370
This is where you can change the color of your pet's feet.

1784
03:20:16,370 --> 03:20:17,370
That's fine.

1785
03:20:21,879 --> 03:20:22,879
Very cool.

1786
03:20:22,879 --> 03:20:25,139
Wildness.

1787
03:20:26,139 --> 03:20:29,139
Now you can choose whether your pet is cute and cuddly,

1788
03:20:29,139 --> 03:20:31,139
or wild and fierce.

1789
03:20:31,139 --> 03:20:33,139
Definitely wild.

1790
03:20:33,139 --> 03:20:35,079
No!

1791
03:20:35,079 --> 03:20:36,079
Wait, actually, that looks more like...

1792
03:20:36,079 --> 03:20:37,079
That does look more like...

1793
03:20:37,079 --> 03:20:39,079
No, that looks like...

1794
03:20:40,079 --> 03:20:47,190
That's more of Spyro.

1795
03:20:50,989 --> 03:20:52,989
Yeah, that's Spyro right there.

1796
03:20:52,989 --> 03:20:53,989
The cute one.

1797
03:21:02,840 --> 03:21:04,850
Build.

1798
03:21:04,850 --> 03:21:06,850
This is where you choose your pet's build.

1799
03:21:06,850 --> 03:21:08,850
Is it sleek or stocky?

1800
03:21:14,319 --> 03:21:15,319
How many can I do?

1801
03:21:16,319 --> 03:21:27,000
I think that's as big as I can make Spyro.

1802
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:34,110
Very cool.

1803
03:21:35,110 --> 03:21:36,350
All right.

1804
03:21:36,350 --> 03:21:37,350
And now fantastic pet.

1805
03:21:42,170 --> 03:21:45,079
Earth?

1806
03:21:45,079 --> 03:21:46,079
You think I'm a cyborg?

1807
03:21:53,370 --> 03:21:54,370
Robot.

1808
03:21:54,370 --> 03:21:55,370
All right.

1809
03:21:56,680 --> 03:21:57,680
Okay.

1810
03:21:57,680 --> 03:21:59,430
Looking good.

1811
03:22:00,430 --> 03:22:05,360
I'm afraid you're a little too close.

1812
03:22:06,360 --> 03:22:12,590
I think it looks cute.

1813
03:22:12,590 --> 03:22:15,209
It's a cool little Spyro...

1814
03:22:16,209 --> 03:22:18,709
Ember the Spyro the Dragon.

1815
03:22:22,100 --> 03:22:25,040
Copy what you see Avatar doing,

1816
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:27,040
and your pet will do something cool.

1817
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:34,790
Run away?

1818
03:22:34,790 --> 03:22:35,790
That's cool.

1819
03:22:35,790 --> 03:22:37,159
That's really cool.

1820
03:22:37,159 --> 03:22:40,159
You can listen to the emails you've received again later

1821
03:22:40,159 --> 03:22:42,159
by using the smartphone.

1822
03:22:42,159 --> 03:22:44,399
My systems include a camera,

1823
03:22:44,399 --> 03:22:47,399
so I can take photographs of any special moments

1824
03:22:47,399 --> 03:22:48,399
and save them for later.

1825
03:22:48,399 --> 03:22:49,399
I need to get photos.

1826
03:22:49,399 --> 03:22:51,399
Or until you decide to delete them.

1827
03:22:52,399 --> 03:22:55,399
You can swap between your pets using the smartphone.

1828
03:22:56,399 --> 03:22:59,399
This is a display of every award you've earned during the game.

1829
03:22:59,399 --> 03:23:00,399
Pet it.

1830
03:23:00,399 --> 03:23:01,399
I will.

1831
03:23:01,399 --> 03:23:03,399
Why not check out the encyclopedia?

1832
03:23:03,399 --> 03:23:05,399
You can get to it from your smartphone,

1833
03:23:05,399 --> 03:23:08,399
and it's full of interesting facts about pets.

1834
03:23:13,219 --> 03:23:14,219
She's right here.

1835
03:23:14,219 --> 03:23:15,219
You're getting a little too...

1836
03:23:15,219 --> 03:23:17,219
Ah, now this is interesting.

1837
03:23:17,219 --> 03:23:19,219
All pets have certain things they want.

1838
03:23:20,219 --> 03:23:22,219
You know, things like food to eat,

1839
03:23:22,219 --> 03:23:23,219
toys to play with,

1840
03:23:23,219 --> 03:23:25,219
or needing to sleep.

1841
03:23:25,219 --> 03:23:28,219
This is what you'll see when a pet wants something.

1842
03:23:29,219 --> 03:23:30,219
Just select that one.

1843
03:23:30,219 --> 03:23:31,219
She just frosted her eyes.

1844
03:23:32,219 --> 03:23:36,600
Perfect.

1845
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:40,030
Time to give your pet a wash.

1846
03:23:40,030 --> 03:23:42,030
To ensure your pet is squeaky clean,

1847
03:23:42,030 --> 03:23:45,030
we'll move through several steps in order.

1848
03:23:45,030 --> 03:23:47,030
I'll help with each step.

1849
03:23:47,030 --> 03:23:49,030
Shower spray.

1850
03:23:49,030 --> 03:23:51,030
This is what you'll see when a pet wants something.

1851
03:23:52,030 --> 03:23:54,030
Just select that thought.

1852
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:01,940
Getting nice and clean.

1853
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:14,159
Pet soap.

1854
03:24:14,159 --> 03:24:16,159
Next is a special pet soap.

1855
03:24:16,159 --> 03:24:19,159
Rub it vigorously to get lots of bubbles.

1856
03:24:20,159 --> 03:24:23,770
Not in the eyes, but...

1857
03:24:31,350 --> 03:24:32,350
Sponge time.

1858
03:24:32,350 --> 03:24:35,350
Now rub the sponge nice and fast to get the pet clean.

1859
03:24:36,350 --> 03:24:55,379
Time to rinse.

1860
03:24:55,379 --> 03:24:58,379
Time to use the shower to wash all the soap away.

1861
03:24:59,379 --> 03:25:01,379
Make sure you don't miss any parts of your pet.

1862
03:25:19,739 --> 03:25:20,979
Hair dryer.

1863
03:25:20,979 --> 03:25:23,979
Finally, blow dry your pet with the hair dryer.

1864
03:25:23,979 --> 03:25:27,979
Be sure to move it around so you get all the dirt in the hose.

1865
03:25:41,059 --> 03:25:52,479
Pet clean.

1866
03:25:53,479 --> 03:25:55,479
Copy the gestures Avatar is performing

1867
03:25:55,479 --> 03:25:57,479
to get your pet to do different things.

1868
03:26:03,620 --> 03:26:07,370
Don't forget that a second player can join in the game

1869
03:26:07,370 --> 03:26:08,370
and you can play with your pet together.

1870
03:26:10,370 --> 03:26:13,370
When two of you are playing, you can both have fun with the pet.

1871
03:26:14,370 --> 03:26:16,370
Plus, some of the play activities support two players,

1872
03:26:16,370 --> 03:26:18,370
so try them out.

1873
03:26:19,370 --> 03:26:24,659
Hi, this is Germa985 and you're watching Germa985

1874
03:26:24,659 --> 03:26:25,659
on the Disney Channel.

1875
03:26:25,659 --> 03:26:26,659
Try all sorts of different gestures

1876
03:26:26,659 --> 03:26:28,659
and see which one your pet responds to.

1877
03:26:29,659 --> 03:26:30,659
I lost my powers.

1878
03:26:38,329 --> 03:26:42,469
Okay, time for your first talent show I think.

1879
03:26:43,469 --> 03:26:44,770
What's a talent show?

1880
03:26:45,770 --> 03:26:47,770
Well, Trainers Headquarters doesn't just find

1881
03:26:47,770 --> 03:26:49,770
and look after their fantastic pets.

1882
03:26:50,770 --> 03:26:52,770
They run the talent shows too.

1883
03:26:56,760 --> 03:26:57,760
Oh, come on.

1884
03:27:05,979 --> 03:27:07,979
A chance for the best trainers and their pets

1885
03:27:07,979 --> 03:27:09,979
to show off their skills to the world.

1886
03:27:10,979 --> 03:27:11,979
You're gonna do great.

1887
03:27:11,979 --> 03:27:13,979
Only one thing, you're too close.

1888
03:27:13,979 --> 03:27:14,979
Mom, is that your...

1889
03:27:14,979 --> 03:27:16,979
Mom, is that your two-year-old?

1890
03:27:16,979 --> 03:27:17,979
...more important than others.

1891
03:27:17,979 --> 03:27:20,979
You can score more points at the big shows,

1892
03:27:20,979 --> 03:27:23,979
but I'm afraid the competition will be tougher.

1893
03:27:23,979 --> 03:27:25,979
If you and your pet do well in an event,

1894
03:27:25,979 --> 03:27:27,979
you might win a bronze rosette.

1895
03:27:28,979 --> 03:27:29,979
If you do really well,

1896
03:27:29,979 --> 03:27:31,979
you might get a silver rosette.

1897
03:27:32,979 --> 03:27:34,979
Wait, silver's better than bronze, right?

1898
03:27:35,979 --> 03:27:36,979
Yes, of course.

1899
03:27:36,979 --> 03:27:37,979
I knew that.

1900
03:27:38,979 --> 03:27:40,979
Finally, if you do extremely well in an event,

1901
03:27:40,979 --> 03:27:42,979
you might win a gold rosette.

1902
03:27:43,979 --> 03:27:44,979
They're the best you can get,

1903
03:27:44,979 --> 03:27:46,979
but you have to work hard.

1904
03:27:46,979 --> 03:27:48,979
I'm afraid you're a little too close.

1905
03:27:49,979 --> 03:27:50,979
Try moving back.

1906
03:27:51,979 --> 03:27:53,159
The points that you earn in talent shows

1907
03:27:53,159 --> 03:27:55,159
are added to your trainer rank,

1908
03:27:55,159 --> 03:27:58,159
so they're absolutely still worth entering,

1909
03:27:58,159 --> 03:27:59,159
even if you don't win.

1910
03:28:00,159 --> 03:28:02,159
Don't worry if you don't do so well in an event.

1911
03:28:02,159 --> 03:28:04,159
You can always practice some more,

1912
03:28:04,159 --> 03:28:05,159
so you can do better in an event.

1913
03:28:05,159 --> 03:28:06,159
I'm trying to get them.

1914
03:28:07,159 --> 03:28:10,329
Remember, talent shows are about having fun with your pet.

1915
03:28:10,329 --> 03:28:11,329
There's cameras everywhere!

1916
03:28:12,329 --> 03:28:13,329
There's cameras in my walls!

1917
03:28:14,329 --> 03:28:32,000
What about the bubble bubbler?

1918
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:40,639
The bubble bubbler.

1919
03:28:41,639 --> 03:28:44,639
Play with bubbles by popping and swirling them around.

1920
03:28:44,639 --> 03:28:47,600
Three.

1921
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:48,600
Two.

1922
03:28:48,600 --> 03:28:49,600
One.

1923
03:28:53,079 --> 03:28:54,079
The faster you move around,

1924
03:28:54,079 --> 03:28:57,260
the more bubbles the bubble bubbler creates.

1925
03:28:58,260 --> 03:29:06,219
It's good!

1926
03:29:06,219 --> 03:29:07,219
You're improving!

1927
03:29:10,219 --> 03:29:14,440
The faster you move around,

1928
03:29:14,440 --> 03:29:17,440
the more bubbles the bubble bubbler creates.

1929
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:21,540
What a talent show!

1930
03:29:21,540 --> 03:29:22,540
For me!

1931
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:24,540
Yeah, burst those bubbles!

1932
03:29:24,540 --> 03:29:28,979
Come on, get one!

1933
03:29:28,979 --> 03:29:29,979
Get one!

1934
03:29:29,979 --> 03:29:30,979
Get one!

1935
03:29:30,979 --> 03:29:54,239
Strike a pose.

1936
03:29:55,239 --> 03:29:56,239
Pose struck.

1937
03:29:56,239 --> 03:29:57,239
Of gold?

1938
03:29:58,239 --> 03:29:59,239
I'm impressed.

1939
03:29:59,239 --> 03:30:00,239
Keep going.

1940
03:30:01,239 --> 03:30:03,049
Ball fetch.

1941
03:30:04,049 --> 03:30:19,120
Right.

1942
03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:20,120
I'm impressed.

1943
03:30:20,120 --> 03:30:23,120
Time to give your pet some exercise with a game of ball fetch.

1944
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:25,120
No, but this one sucks.

1945
03:30:29,750 --> 03:30:30,750
Reach.

1946
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:32,750
Try throwing the ball into the screen.

1947
03:30:36,100 --> 03:30:39,100
The markers on the floor display how far your last throw

1948
03:30:39,100 --> 03:30:41,100
and your longest throw went before the ball bounced.

1949
03:30:42,100 --> 03:30:44,100
Whoa, you're getting a little too close.

1950
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:46,100
Try taking a step back.

1951
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:19,520
Just kind of what happens in

1952
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:21,520
just like fetch with a dog for long enough

1953
03:31:21,520 --> 03:31:23,520
and they're still so enthusiastic about it,

1954
03:31:23,520 --> 03:31:26,520
but you aren't having the 50th time.

1955
03:31:27,520 --> 03:31:32,989
Try, Link.

1956
03:31:32,989 --> 03:31:36,120
It looks like your pet is enjoying this.

1957
03:31:36,120 --> 03:31:38,120
You're like, ah, I'm kind of done.

1958
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:40,489
Are you?

1959
03:31:40,489 --> 03:31:41,489
Are you?

1960
03:31:41,489 --> 03:31:43,489
That's enough ball fetch for now.

1961
03:31:54,969 --> 03:31:55,969
I'm afraid.

1962
03:31:55,969 --> 03:31:56,969
Strike a pose.

1963
03:31:56,969 --> 03:31:57,969
Finish.

1964
03:31:58,969 --> 03:31:59,969
You're on the way up.

1965
03:31:59,969 --> 03:32:00,969
Keep going.

1966
03:32:01,969 --> 03:32:02,969
I'm so good at this game.

1967
03:32:02,969 --> 03:32:03,969
It's just ridiculous.

1968
03:32:03,969 --> 03:32:04,969
Pinata.

1969
03:32:10,180 --> 03:32:11,180
What do you risk it?

1970
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:12,180
Sandy scaly ruffles.

1971
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:14,180
You're all done.

1972
03:32:15,799 --> 03:32:16,799
Pinata.

1973
03:32:17,799 --> 03:32:19,799
Time to give your pet those tasty treats

1974
03:32:19,799 --> 03:32:21,799
by pounding the paper pinata.

1975
03:32:21,799 --> 03:32:22,799
Four.

1976
03:32:22,799 --> 03:32:23,799
Three.

1977
03:32:23,799 --> 03:32:24,799
Two.

1978
03:32:24,799 --> 03:32:25,799
One.

1979
03:32:25,799 --> 03:32:26,799
Go.

1980
03:32:26,799 --> 03:32:43,450
Bring on.

1981
03:32:43,450 --> 03:32:45,450
Be careful you don't swing too hard

1982
03:32:45,450 --> 03:32:47,450
and pinata smash.

1983
03:32:55,219 --> 03:33:02,600
You're improving.

1984
03:33:02,600 --> 03:33:03,600
Bring on the neck.

1985
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,420
Yes.

1986
03:33:05,420 --> 03:33:06,420
Good work.

1987
03:33:06,420 --> 03:33:17,520
Yes.

1988
03:33:17,520 --> 03:33:45,059
Take the picture.

1989
03:33:46,059 --> 03:33:51,840
Strike a pose.

1990
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:52,840
Finish.

1991
03:33:53,840 --> 03:33:54,840
What silver.

1992
03:33:54,840 --> 03:33:55,840
It's supposed to be a breast game.

1993
03:33:55,840 --> 03:33:56,840
Nice work.

1994
03:33:56,840 --> 03:33:57,840
Keep going.

1995
03:33:57,840 --> 03:33:59,920
Brush time.

1996
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:00,920
I know.

1997
03:34:00,920 --> 03:34:01,920
Wait.

1998
03:34:01,920 --> 03:34:03,280
Whoa.

1999
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:04,280
You're getting a little too close.

2000
03:34:05,280 --> 03:34:06,280
Try taking a step back.

2001
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:12,000
All pets need to be brushed from time to time.

2002
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:16,000
Move your brush along your pet in nice, smooth movements.

2003
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:18,000
I'm afraid you're a little too close.

2004
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:20,000
Try moving back.

2005
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:30,489
Perfect brushing speed.

2006
03:34:34,139 --> 03:34:38,069
That's it.

2007
03:34:38,069 --> 03:34:40,069
Perfect brushing speed.

2008
03:34:41,069 --> 03:34:54,190
You're brushing too quickly.

2009
03:35:01,319 --> 03:35:02,809
There you go.

2010
03:35:02,809 --> 03:35:04,809
One perfectly brushed pet.

2011
03:35:07,440 --> 03:35:09,760
A gem.

2012
03:35:10,760 --> 03:35:21,350
Strike a pose.

2013
03:35:21,350 --> 03:35:22,350
Finished.

2014
03:35:23,350 --> 03:35:26,350
What I always thought silver was much classier than gold.

2015
03:35:27,350 --> 03:35:29,549
Power pounce.

2016
03:35:29,549 --> 03:35:30,549
Next.

2017
03:35:31,549 --> 03:35:32,549
Not yet.

2018
03:35:32,549 --> 03:35:33,549
Not yet.

2019
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:43,000
Help your pet run as fast as it can.

2020
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:46,000
Then tell it when to jump for maximum score.

2021
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:51,120
Three.

2022
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:52,120
Two.

2023
03:35:52,120 --> 03:35:53,120
How do I do that?

2024
03:35:53,120 --> 03:35:54,120
One.

2025
03:35:54,120 --> 03:35:55,120
Start running.

2026
03:35:55,120 --> 03:36:03,459
Jump.

2027
03:36:03,459 --> 03:36:04,459
Wow.

2028
03:36:04,459 --> 03:36:09,409
You're fast.

2029
03:36:09,409 --> 03:36:10,409
Jump.

2030
03:36:10,409 --> 03:36:11,409
Jump.

2031
03:36:11,409 --> 03:36:12,409
Crouch.

2032
03:36:12,409 --> 03:36:14,870
Jump.

2033
03:36:14,870 --> 03:36:15,870
Holy shit.

2034
03:36:15,870 --> 03:36:19,159
That was the low score you get.

2035
03:36:19,159 --> 03:36:20,159
Second jump.

2036
03:36:20,159 --> 03:36:21,159
Three.

2037
03:36:21,159 --> 03:36:22,159
Two.

2038
03:36:22,159 --> 03:36:23,590
One.

2039
03:36:23,590 --> 03:36:24,590
Start running.

2040
03:36:24,590 --> 03:36:29,920
Keep going.

2041
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:35,899
Keep going.

2042
03:36:35,899 --> 03:36:36,899
Crouch down.

2043
03:36:36,899 --> 03:36:37,899
Jump.

2044
03:36:38,899 --> 03:36:40,909
Yes.

2045
03:36:40,909 --> 03:36:45,799
Three.

2046
03:36:45,799 --> 03:36:46,799
Two.

2047
03:36:46,799 --> 03:36:47,799
One.

2048
03:36:47,799 --> 03:36:49,479
Start running.

2049
03:36:49,479 --> 03:36:55,329
That's it.

2050
03:36:55,329 --> 03:36:56,329
Keep going.

2051
03:37:02,239 --> 03:37:03,239
Crouch down.

2052
03:37:03,239 --> 03:37:04,239
Jump.

2053
03:37:05,239 --> 03:37:08,209
Power pounce.

2054
03:37:08,209 --> 03:37:09,209
Finished.

2055
03:37:10,389 --> 03:37:12,389
Part of my body that I can't talk about.

2056
03:37:12,389 --> 03:37:16,879
I went up and down too hard and it's like, you know what I'm saying?

2057
03:37:22,799 --> 03:37:27,120
It's like, that fucking hurt.

2058
03:37:53,239 --> 03:37:55,239
Are you going to be beyond sore tomorrow?

2059
03:37:55,239 --> 03:37:57,239
I was really sore this morning.

2060
03:37:57,239 --> 03:37:58,549
After yesterday.

2061
03:37:58,549 --> 03:38:00,549
Six hours of this?

2062
03:38:01,549 --> 03:38:03,549
You better believe it.

2063
03:38:04,549 --> 03:38:07,549
Because we toddler walking up the stairs.

2064
03:38:14,360 --> 03:38:15,360
It's good for me though.

2065
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:16,979
It's good for me.

2066
03:38:26,209 --> 03:38:27,209
All right.

2067
03:38:27,209 --> 03:38:29,209
We are at the 30 minute mark for this one.

2068
03:38:30,209 --> 03:38:34,209
I think it's time to stick around for like another 20 minutes.

2069
03:39:02,319 --> 03:39:04,319
Dig in my floor?

2070
03:39:04,319 --> 03:39:06,500
What are you talking about?

2071
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:23,450
Don't dig that up.

2072
03:39:27,450 --> 03:39:29,450
Go dig over here.

2073
03:39:31,450 --> 03:39:33,270
Dig.

2074
03:39:34,270 --> 03:39:37,110
Right there.

2075
03:39:42,670 --> 03:39:43,670
Dig.

2076
03:39:44,670 --> 03:39:45,670
Okay.

2077
03:39:45,670 --> 03:39:47,670
Shutting down tutorial systems.

2078
03:39:47,670 --> 03:39:49,670
Enjoy the game.

2079
03:39:49,670 --> 03:39:57,440
Dig.

2080
03:39:57,440 --> 03:39:58,440
That's it.

2081
03:39:58,440 --> 03:40:04,350
Good.

2082
03:40:04,350 --> 03:40:06,159
Sit.

2083
03:40:06,159 --> 03:40:18,729
Sit.

2084
03:40:18,729 --> 03:40:37,290
Time for some exercise.

2085
03:40:37,290 --> 03:40:38,290
Done.

2086
03:40:38,290 --> 03:40:41,940
Be careful you don't trip over anything.

2087
03:40:52,139 --> 03:40:53,139
That was fun.

2088
03:40:53,139 --> 03:41:00,079
Okay.

2089
03:41:00,079 --> 03:41:01,079
That's it.

2090
03:41:01,079 --> 03:41:02,079
Good.

2091
03:41:03,079 --> 03:41:05,079
Let's have a second player.

2092
03:41:05,079 --> 03:41:07,079
Please wave at the screen to begin.

2093
03:41:10,719 --> 03:41:12,719
Starting two player play.

2094
03:41:12,719 --> 03:41:15,440
Whoa.

2095
03:41:15,440 --> 03:41:17,440
You're getting a little too close.

2096
03:41:17,440 --> 03:41:19,440
What do I do now?

2097
03:41:31,360 --> 03:41:33,360
Be careful you don't trip over anything.

2098
03:41:37,370 --> 03:41:51,840
You're getting a little too close.

2099
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:52,840
Try taking a step back.

2100
03:41:52,840 --> 03:41:53,840
Sit.

2101
03:41:55,329 --> 03:41:56,329
Sit.

2102
03:41:56,329 --> 03:41:58,979
Good.

2103
03:41:58,979 --> 03:42:00,280
All right.

2104
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:06,639
Time for some exercise.

2105
03:42:08,399 --> 03:42:09,399
What?

2106
03:42:09,399 --> 03:42:10,399
Exercise?

2107
03:42:11,399 --> 03:42:32,049
Organization options ready to use.

2108
03:42:37,559 --> 03:42:38,559
Set.

2109
03:42:39,559 --> 03:42:41,950
Jump.

2110
03:42:43,959 --> 03:42:44,959
Chase time.

2111
03:42:44,959 --> 03:42:46,959
Returning to single player control.

2112
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:51,840
Starting co-op play.

2113
03:42:51,840 --> 03:42:53,840
Please wave at the screen to begin.

2114
03:42:55,840 --> 03:43:08,510
That was a fantastic cut.

2115
03:43:08,510 --> 03:43:18,899
Oh, boy.

2116
03:43:18,899 --> 03:43:19,899
You can't even see me.

2117
03:43:19,899 --> 03:43:23,829
Finally.

2118
03:43:23,829 --> 03:43:25,639
All right.

2119
03:43:27,590 --> 03:43:29,590
There's so many good ones that are still here.

2120
03:43:32,530 --> 03:43:37,360
I don't know.

2121
03:43:37,360 --> 03:43:39,360
There's so many that are so good.

2122
03:43:39,360 --> 03:43:41,489
What time is it?

2123
03:43:41,489 --> 03:43:43,489
It's been about four hours.

2124
03:43:43,489 --> 03:43:44,489
All right.

2125
03:43:44,489 --> 03:43:47,489
I feel like I want to give that one all day.

2126
03:43:48,489 --> 03:43:53,799
I've got too many of these.

2127
03:43:54,799 --> 03:44:00,139
All right.

2128
03:44:00,139 --> 03:44:10,850
This is going to be a good one.

2129
03:44:10,850 --> 03:44:20,860
The price is right.

2130
03:44:20,860 --> 03:44:31,420
This is going to be a good one.

2131
03:44:31,420 --> 03:44:36,760
That's not the horror one.

2132
03:44:36,760 --> 03:44:39,760
I know, but I think that's a full game.

2133
03:44:39,760 --> 03:44:44,829
I think that Rise of Nightmares is a full experience.

2134
03:44:44,829 --> 03:44:46,829
I think I want to give that one.

2135
03:44:46,829 --> 03:44:47,829
I don't know.

2136
03:44:47,829 --> 03:45:08,120
That didn't sound good.

2137
03:45:08,120 --> 03:45:12,809
Uh-oh.

2138
03:45:17,979 --> 03:45:19,979
I think it's all right.

2139
03:45:19,979 --> 03:45:21,409
Hey, the shuts us off.

2140
03:45:21,409 --> 03:45:22,409
It shuts us off.

2141
03:45:22,409 --> 03:45:23,409
We're not done.

2142
03:45:23,409 --> 03:45:24,780
Price is right.

2143
03:45:24,780 --> 03:45:25,780
Connect.

2144
03:45:27,079 --> 03:45:40,159
No.

2145
03:45:40,159 --> 03:46:01,180
Where's the connect?

2146
03:46:01,180 --> 03:46:04,120
Connect party.

2147
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:10,440
You'll have to exit the game if you don't have a sensor.

2148
03:46:10,440 --> 03:46:12,930
What do you mean the connect party game?

2149
03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:29,530
Let's go.

2150
03:46:29,530 --> 03:46:33,309
What do you mean party?

2151
03:46:33,309 --> 03:46:38,620
What is that bullshit?

2152
03:46:38,620 --> 03:46:41,620
Is this just tacked on horseshit connect mode?

2153
03:46:41,620 --> 03:46:58,069
The price is right.

2154
03:46:58,069 --> 03:47:06,860
They picked me.

2155
03:47:06,860 --> 03:47:07,860
I can't believe it.

2156
03:47:07,860 --> 03:47:11,020
Hey, Bob.

2157
03:47:11,020 --> 03:47:16,479
Pool table.

2158
03:47:16,479 --> 03:47:20,360
The entire family can have our fabulous pool table.

2159
03:47:20,360 --> 03:47:21,360
That's like two grand.

2160
03:47:21,360 --> 03:47:24,360
It's finished in light English oak and comes with an accessory

2161
03:47:24,360 --> 03:47:25,360
package.

2162
03:47:25,360 --> 03:47:26,360
2200.

2163
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:32,010
Let's start the bidding.

2164
03:47:32,010 --> 03:47:36,989
2200.

2165
03:47:36,989 --> 03:47:37,989
2200.

2166
03:47:37,989 --> 03:47:52,620
I thought that's what they did.

2167
03:47:52,620 --> 03:47:57,250
What?

2168
03:47:57,250 --> 03:47:58,250
That's dumb.

2169
03:47:58,250 --> 03:48:02,350
You only get one choice.

2170
03:48:02,350 --> 03:48:03,350
It's me.

2171
03:48:03,350 --> 03:48:04,590
2195.

2172
03:48:04,590 --> 03:48:05,590
It's 2195.

2173
03:48:05,590 --> 03:48:07,530
That's 2200 bucks.

2174
03:48:07,530 --> 03:48:08,530
Eggs, Bob.

2175
03:48:08,530 --> 03:48:09,530
2695.

2176
03:48:09,530 --> 03:48:10,530
Now let's play my...

2177
03:48:10,530 --> 03:48:18,170
Is that the Xbox?

2178
03:48:18,170 --> 03:48:24,719
I thought that was a construction work or something.

2179
03:48:24,719 --> 03:48:25,719
Okay.

2180
03:48:25,719 --> 03:48:28,370
Basis and glassware.

2181
03:48:28,370 --> 03:48:29,370
Shelves.

2182
03:48:29,370 --> 03:48:31,959
Bed.

2183
03:48:31,959 --> 03:48:32,959

03:48:44,889 --> 03:48:45,889
Bed.

2193

Bed.

2201
03:48:54,950 --> 03:48:55,950
Bed.

2202
03:48:55,950 --> 03:48:56,950

No.

2208
03:49:02,950 --> 03:49:03,950
Bed.

2209
03:49:03,950 --> 03:49:04,950
Bed.

2210
03:49:04,950 --> 03:49:05,950
Bed.

2211
03:49:05,950 --> 03:49:06,950
In between the two prices.

2212
03:49:06,950 --> 03:49:13,090
Alright, I'm going to say in between the two prices.

2213
03:49:13,090 --> 03:49:14,090
In between the two prices.

2214
03:49:14,090 --> 03:49:18,090
to enter a value which you believe is in between the two prices.

2215
03:49:18,090 --> 03:49:35,450
All right, I'm going to say in between the two prices, the shelves are probably like

2216
03:49:35,450 --> 03:49:43,670
three or four hundred. The bed is probably like six hundred, seven hundred. The shelves

2217
03:49:43,670 --> 03:49:53,479
are probably three hundred. I'm going to say five hundred bucks. The shelves are not more

2218
03:49:53,479 --> 03:50:09,709
than five hundred. Six hundred? Yeah, no, I'm going to say five fifty. Four seventy, five oh two.

2219
03:50:30,350 --> 03:50:42,879
What? A fucking queen size pillow top bed is three thousand dollars? Is it a bar of gold?

2220
03:50:44,360 --> 03:50:51,389
I have a king size bed in there right now. We can take up a lot of space. We might not be very big

2221
03:50:51,389 --> 03:50:56,840
people. That shit was not more than a thousand dollars. It was like eleven hundred bucks.

2222
03:50:58,520 --> 03:51:05,690
Two thousand four beds for fucking cars. I forgot. Continue. That shelf is like a fucking

2223
03:51:05,690 --> 03:51:23,819
bed of plastic. That's like two hundred bucks. Plastic shelf with like two glass vases on it.

2224
03:51:23,819 --> 03:51:25,020
I still got to go to the showcase?

2225
03:52:05,930 --> 03:52:22,000
Ninety five eighty five. I'm going to the showcase. I can't believe it. I'm constantly laughing.

2226
03:52:30,670 --> 03:52:34,909
Showcases up for bid. Got to nail this one. It's the closest to the actual retail price.

2227
03:52:34,909 --> 03:52:40,829
Without going over, wins their showcase. If your bid is within two hundred and fifty dollars of

2228
03:52:40,829 --> 03:52:46,190
the actual retail price of your showcase, you win both showcases. Can you make him dab? Let's see

2229
03:52:46,190 --> 03:52:54,719
the first showcase. Our showcase begins with your very own copy of Star Wars. Star Wars. This new

2230
03:52:54,719 --> 03:53:05,000
VCR DVD player will force you to work out once you own a new home gym. A Star Wars DVD player

2231
03:53:06,360 --> 03:53:19,469
and a home gym. Let's see. That's probably five grand. Four grand. Five grand. More than that

2232
03:53:19,469 --> 03:53:27,549
maybe. And a car. 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. That's probably seven. Eighteen thousand dollars.

2233
03:53:27,549 --> 03:53:34,120
Twenty thousand. Eighteen thousand. Eighteen five. Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars.

2234
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:44,649
Twenty. Maybe twenty four thousand. Twenty four thousand. Plus five thousand to the gym. Twenty

2235
03:53:44,649 --> 03:53:51,690
four. Twenty nine. Plus the DVD player. Thirty thousand. I'm going to say thirty one. Thirty

2236
03:53:51,690 --> 03:54:13,420
thousand dollars. Thirty. Twenty nine eight six six. Twenty nine eight four four. This game's

2237
03:54:13,420 --> 03:54:22,120
dumb. It's either thirty or thirty three. I'm going to say thirty. Thirty four three eight.

2238
03:54:26,510 --> 03:54:32,430
Let's go to party mode. Your showcase begins with this fashionable new luggage.

2239
03:54:32,430 --> 03:54:41,920
For stylish luggage pieces which are as durable as they are beautiful. Go back to Power Rangers.

2240
03:54:41,920 --> 03:54:47,709
Wherever you go. Javiv by Boyd travel in luxury. And now it's time to pack those bags.

2241
03:54:47,709 --> 03:54:55,040
Luggage uh twenty two hundred bucks. Two thousand. Three thousand. To exciting Vancouver.

2242
03:54:56,479 --> 03:55:01,760
Vancouver. A Vancouver getaway. How long? A round trip coach from Los Angeles to Vancouver

2243
03:55:01,760 --> 03:55:12,079
British Columbia. How long? Six nights. Hotel. Three hundred bucks a night. And then Tokyo.

2244
03:55:12,079 --> 03:55:18,879
You're talking about three. Twelve. Twenty. Plus Tokyo. This is way cooler. Stop. What the fuck?

2245
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:28,920
Okay you've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth. The actual retail price

2246
03:55:28,920 --> 03:55:45,920
of the first showcase is. A difference of. A difference of. That's right. Your opponent's bid

2247
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:53,659
is closest. This mode is terrible. I won't play the regular mode. I don't care. I've got to use

2248
03:55:53,659 --> 03:56:10,860
a controller. I'm doing it. The Kinect mode sucks. No. Get out. All right. Single player.

2249
03:56:11,579 --> 03:56:16,719
Welcome to the prices right. We need your help. Just pretend that I'm doing Kinect.

2250
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:24,270
We found a box of unmarked tapes dating back to 1972 that we need your help identifying.

2251
03:56:32,459 --> 03:56:35,500
We've sent along the lovely Jessica to help you in your task. Good luck.

2252
03:56:42,940 --> 03:56:52,239
Yeah. Why are we playing old tapes from the 70s? Why wouldn't you just make a prices right game?

2253
03:56:52,959 --> 03:57:26,760
What is with all this nonsense? 1983. You're too close. Oh fuck. Sorry.

2254
03:57:30,120 --> 03:57:34,200
All right. Let's go. You look like that guy. You look like that second guy.

2255
03:57:34,200 --> 03:57:43,260
Okay. It's a trampoline. Trampoline. With a unique ground design for outdoor fun and recreation.

2256
03:57:43,260 --> 03:57:49,100
Ideal for physical fitness with features such as uniform and larger jumping area from round

2257
03:57:49,100 --> 03:57:58,059
trampoline. Let's start the bidding. What's your bid? Yeah. This is much better. All right. I'm

2258
03:57:58,059 --> 03:58:03,959
going to say five. I'm going to say. Please give me your bid. 699. I think it's. I'm going to say

2259
03:58:04,600 --> 03:58:48,590
699. They're like 700. No. 750. 799. 800. 799. First try by the way. The Plinko machine. Yeah.

2260
03:58:49,709 --> 03:58:55,799
This is a good one. This is probably the best one. All right. Let's go. First you need to earn

2261
03:58:55,799 --> 03:59:01,639
your Plinko chips. You start out with one free chip, but you can win up to four more Plinkos.

2262
03:59:01,639 --> 03:59:06,840
Four different items on display. Each item has a two number price, but only one of those numbers

2263
03:59:06,840 --> 03:59:14,360
is correct. Let's take a look at the first item. It's a queen size bed sack. It provides luxury.

2264
03:59:14,360 --> 03:59:19,159
Pillow case. That's inaccurate. Box springs and protection for youth from bed sack.

2265
03:59:19,159 --> 03:59:22,840
No. Wait a minute. Or the left number, the correct number in the price.

2266
03:59:23,319 --> 03:59:31,559
Wait a minute. Okay. So it's the left number. 39. It's probably 30. It's probably like 29.

2267
03:59:32,360 --> 03:59:42,379
It's the nine. You can earn another chip with this item. Be everything you can be with Mary Kay

2268
03:59:42,379 --> 03:59:46,299
Cosmetics. Skin care and glamour cosmetics presented in your home. Makeup is expensive.

2269
03:59:48,520 --> 03:59:54,840
Is the right or the left number. No product has. It's either 79 or it's 84.99. The left one is

2270
03:59:54,840 --> 04:00:13,850
correct. 71 fucking dollars. What is the right or the left number, the correct number in the price.

2271
04:00:17,799 --> 04:00:25,469
The five. A vacuum cleaner is like a hundred bucks. Here's another Plinko chip. This is your

2272
04:00:25,469 --> 04:00:30,989
last chance to earn a Plinko chip. 71? Stainless steel kitchenware. The choice of many fine

2273
04:00:30,989 --> 04:00:37,799
restaurants. Prepare, cook, and serve food in your home. Is the right or the left number,

2274
04:00:37,799 --> 04:00:42,920
the correct number in the price. Those are three. It's definitely the right number because

2275
04:00:42,920 --> 04:00:47,559
that's more expensive for sure. Here's another Plinko chip. I mean, it's cheaper. Those things,

2276
04:00:47,559 --> 04:00:54,280
dog shit they shittily made. The bad quality. Drop your chips. I'm just kidding. If that company

2277
04:00:54,280 --> 04:01:03,600
still exists 30 years later, I was making a joke. All right. I usually go all the way to the left.

2278
04:01:16,360 --> 04:01:52,120
Again, only the left. Only. This is your last chip. No zero. Congratulations. 1500 bucks. No zero.

2279
04:01:53,690 --> 04:01:56,250
You're not going for, if you drop it in the middle, you're going to get a zero.

2280
04:01:57,370 --> 04:02:02,489
Don't you guys know how to play these? If you go in the middle, this shit balls in the zeros

2281
04:02:02,489 --> 04:02:06,170
and you don't have anything. If your spin or your combination of two spins is higher,

2282
04:02:06,170 --> 04:02:12,809
that's enough money to go get yourself a shelf. Be careful though. If you go over one dollar,

2283
04:02:12,809 --> 04:02:18,329
you'll lose. If your total is exactly one dollar, you'll win one thousand dollars

2284
04:02:18,329 --> 04:02:25,850
and you'll spin again. You got 90. I lose. It's your turn to spin.

2285
04:02:37,049 --> 04:02:45,719
One dollar, one dollar, one 30 cents. Come on. All right. I give you 70. You have to spin the

2286
04:02:45,719 --> 04:02:59,239
wheel again. It's your turn to spin. 70, 60, 60.

2287
04:03:11,440 --> 04:03:18,680
Why would I look that happy? I wouldn't be that happy. I'd be very upset about that.

2288
04:03:22,040 --> 04:03:25,559
Well, at least you won. I mean, actually walking out of there with free grand.

2289
04:03:26,700 --> 04:03:29,819
You don't have access to the archives. You can access them from the single player menu.

2290
04:03:29,819 --> 04:03:52,780
New show unlocked. This is fucking stupid. Why would you count? Why can't we just play

2291
04:03:54,219 --> 04:03:57,899
defensive right in the gear that it currently is? Is it really that big of a deal?

2292
04:03:59,739 --> 04:04:03,690
We have to go different gears every game?

2293
04:04:12,569 --> 04:04:21,420
There we go. 2005, the future.

2294
04:04:23,340 --> 04:04:27,180
No, I got to get this. I'm going to nail this. You guys in my audience, you got to help me.

2295
04:04:27,260 --> 04:04:27,899
You have to help me.

2296
04:04:35,899 --> 04:04:40,170
Well, here it comes. A beautiful new area rug. I thought that was a board game.

2297
04:04:41,819 --> 04:04:42,620
Area rug.

2298
04:04:49,440 --> 04:04:55,760
Not expensive at all. Like 50 bucks? 100, 125.

2299
04:04:55,760 --> 04:05:09,709
What? 110? What year is it? $1,000 for an area rug.

2300
04:05:13,180 --> 04:05:28,459
No way. No way. 2005. Nice area rug. 400. I'm going to say 400.

2301
04:05:28,459 --> 04:05:47,799
$4,400. $1,000. You can get a rug like that for 40 bucks.

2302
04:05:56,639 --> 04:06:01,520
Ooh, a stove. $750.

2303
04:06:02,000 --> 04:06:05,280
And self-cleaning convection oven with three heavy duty oven racks.

2304
04:06:07,239 --> 04:06:14,760
A stainless steel stove is not five grand. $5,000. No, it's like, it's like 800.

2305
04:06:19,079 --> 04:06:25,520
They're not this expensive. No, it's cheaper, man. It's like, it's...

2306
04:06:26,159 --> 04:06:55,549
$5,000. I think it was fucking $1,300. $1,000.

2307
04:06:59,850 --> 04:07:04,090
All right, now these back in the 15 years ago or so, these were like $2,000.

2308
04:07:05,610 --> 04:07:15,049
$3,000 at least. It's probably like, it's probably like, it's probably like $7,000. $6,000.

2309
04:07:20,239 --> 04:07:31,319
Okay, please give me your bid. How much do you think it's worth? Your bid, please.

2310
04:07:31,319 --> 04:07:54,350
Was the first thing I said $2,000? I said like $2,000, $3,000 originally. It's $21,000.

2311
04:07:54,350 --> 04:08:01,479
It's going to be like, it's going to be like $21,500. Got it. Oh, right, it went over.

2312
04:08:05,360 --> 04:08:10,729
Let me just let you play until you get to go on stage. I've been here for five days.

2313
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:20,809
Big selection of phone... Vtech. Three multi-phone systems from one phone app.

2314
04:08:20,809 --> 04:08:25,290
Set up digital mailboxes and staff telemarketing calls with a telezapper.

2315
04:08:25,290 --> 04:08:28,090
$60, $65. Vtech technology. You can clearly hear.

2316
04:08:29,770 --> 04:08:33,370
Let's start the bid. $69, like 70 bucks. All right, what's your bid?

2317
04:08:33,370 --> 04:08:44,569
$80. Okay, please give me your bid. How much do you think it's worth?

2318
04:08:44,569 --> 04:08:49,290
For a cordless landline in 2005? Five fucking hundred bucks?

2319
04:08:50,250 --> 04:09:11,280
Can you please not do that? It's got to get lucky.

2320
04:09:21,690 --> 04:09:34,280
$1,000 for a cordless landline. That was not that $1,000 fucking dollars. That can't be accurate.

2321
04:09:40,250 --> 04:09:43,770
More than what? Why would you have like 15 cordless phones in your house?

2322
04:09:44,649 --> 04:09:52,489
Is there one in your shower? 20 cordless phones in every fucking room?

2323
04:10:01,979 --> 04:10:12,319
A whole scuba set? An entire scuba diving set? I have no idea. I'm going to say $1,800.

2324
04:10:12,319 --> 04:10:29,799
I have absolutely no clue. $1,800. $1,700. Sorry, buddy. You were close, but you went over.

2325
04:10:31,079 --> 04:10:40,510
Good game time. That's when Bob Barker comes over and he goes,

2326
04:10:40,510 --> 04:10:46,190
Oh, hey, Jeremy. It seems like you've been here for a few days. Five days to be exact.

2327
04:10:46,190 --> 04:10:50,350
You keep showing up and getting in line. And I'm like, yeah, Bob. I really love the show.

2328
04:10:51,309 --> 04:10:55,469
The next prize's first digit is one of the two from the first item.

2329
04:10:58,590 --> 04:11:06,329
Uh, silver. Silver. 46 pieces.

2330
04:11:11,129 --> 04:11:19,209
I got a shirt that says like, Bob is so cool and sexy, right? Oh, I love Bob.

2331
04:11:50,159 --> 04:11:53,600
Get that guy out of here. I don't want to see him in line ever again.

2332
04:11:54,239 --> 04:12:00,079
You'll spin the wheel. If you're spin or your fucking weirdo is higher than the current leader,

2333
04:12:00,079 --> 04:12:05,360
you'll win the chance to play in the showcase. Be careful though. If you go over $1,

2334
04:12:05,360 --> 04:12:11,040
you'll get a shirt that said, I love Bob. And weirdly enough, he had these huge yellow

2335
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:15,920
pit stains underneath his underarms. I don't think he's ever taken that shirt off.

2336
04:12:16,319 --> 04:12:38,430
Beat his score to win. It's your turn to spin. 65. Result is lower than the leader.

2337
04:12:38,430 --> 04:12:41,629
You have to spin the wheel again. It's your turn to spin.

2338
04:12:42,670 --> 04:12:54,680
I got it. I'm looking for low. Low, low, low, low, low. Come on. There it is. I'm in the showcase.

2339
04:12:55,319 --> 04:13:06,889
20. Oh, god damn. Yeah, Bob. I can't wait.

2340
04:13:17,260 --> 04:13:21,260
The player who bids the closest to the actual retail price without going over

2341
04:13:21,260 --> 04:13:28,459
wins their showcase. If your bid is within $250 of the actual retail price of your showcase,

2342
04:13:28,459 --> 04:13:32,540
you win both showcases. Let's see the first showcase.

2343
04:13:33,100 --> 04:13:42,489
Your showcase begins with a wonderful collection of cookbooks. Cookbooks can be pretty expensive.

2344
04:13:42,489 --> 04:13:47,530
Books to help you cook and entertain like a pro. Classic cuisines from around the world

2345
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:51,930
with guides to find food and find wine. Back in 2005, you're talking about probably

2346
04:13:51,930 --> 04:13:57,450
two, 300 bucks for something like this. And you can serve it in this lovely new dining room.

2347
04:13:57,610 --> 04:13:58,809
Dining room. What kind of wood?

2348
04:13:59,770 --> 04:14:05,950
Furniture Saddle Creek collection. This nine-piece dining room group with ladderback chairs and

2349
04:14:05,950 --> 04:14:15,870

collection from Royal Prestige features nocturnal china coordinating lead crystal and flatware for

2351
04:14:21,950 --> 04:14:28,860
the ultimate dining experience from Royal Prestige. You know, like this thing I understand about

2352
04:14:28,860 --> 04:14:40,440
humans. I have a human complaint, okay? You could go get a 60-piece set of silverware

2353
04:14:41,319 --> 04:14:49,559
for probably $25 at Walmart. Why in a million years, even if you had a million dollars,

2354
04:14:50,360 --> 04:14:56,280
would you buy like a thousand dollar silverware that you're going to use? It's like, it's like

2355
04:14:56,280 --> 04:15:07,260
25 bucks. And nobody cares about that shit. Do you think anybody looks at your silverware

2356
04:15:07,260 --> 04:15:12,219
on your house? No. In fact, well, maybe they do, but they're probably, what they're looking for

2357
04:15:12,219 --> 04:15:16,780
is they're looking for like the dishwasher stains to rub off on their shirt. They don't care about

2358
04:15:16,780 --> 04:15:21,739
if it's gold or not. You know, like those like white spots and they're like, oh, shh. Can they

2359
04:15:21,739 --> 04:15:30,889
see me do this? Like, oh, okay. Nobody gives a shit about your gold silverware. Give me that one,

2360
04:15:30,889 --> 04:15:43,610
I don't want that one. I'd buy a silverware because if they had a stone and I would say

2361
04:15:43,610 --> 04:15:50,889
I wouldn't even care. All right. This exotic styling and intricate embossed detail,

2362
04:15:50,889 --> 04:15:56,250
this Paul Meadow Road 30, $3,500 from Ashley can transform the atmosphere of any room

2363
04:15:56,250 --> 04:16:03,049
from the Ashley companies. Maybe more, like five grand maybe. And it's carpet too.

2364
04:16:03,049 --> 04:16:08,329
Bernier Willam Mills is the ultimate wool carpet manufactured from 100% New Zealand wool fiber.

2365
04:16:08,409 --> 04:16:15,209
Enjoy performance, comfort, and elegance with 60 square yards. Probably seven grand, eight grand.

2366
04:16:15,209 --> 04:16:21,690
You can also win these authentic German beer steins. All right. That's cool. It's a collection of

2367
04:16:21,690 --> 04:16:26,649
limited edition German beer steins. I gotta try to get one of these so I can. With these authentic

2368
04:16:26,649 --> 04:16:34,809
German made steins featuring fancy comical or decorative butylins. And take a look at

2369
04:16:34,809 --> 04:16:43,000
this fantastic trip to Germany. Going to Germany. A round trip coach from Los Angeles to Munich,

2370
04:16:43,000 --> 04:16:49,319
Germany for a six night stay at a luxury hotel. Eat, drink, and be merry in Bavaria's capital city.

2371
04:16:49,319 --> 04:16:53,000
All right. I'm going to say. These can be yours if the price is right.

2372
04:16:53,639 --> 04:17:01,239
That's probably 10, 12 grand, 10 grand. The steins are probably $1,200, $2,000. The steins

2373
04:17:01,239 --> 04:17:22,120
are probably $2,000. The 15, 16. I'm going to say. I'm going to say $16,000. $16,000. $16,492.

2374
04:17:22,120 --> 04:17:33,319
Okay. You've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth. The actual retail price

2375
04:17:33,319 --> 04:17:44,680
of the second showcase is a difference of actual retail price of the first showcase is

2376
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:53,520
is over. The actual retail price. I'm going to Germany. Let's go.

2377
04:18:07,760 --> 04:18:14,649
Very good. We'll do one more. We'll do one more and then we're going to play. We'll probably be

2378
04:18:14,649 --> 04:18:30,670
able to play another one or two. I think I've got a good one. Now don't. Please don't. Please

2379
04:18:30,670 --> 04:18:36,670
don't play this one. I love the price is right. It's a little like ice cream.

2380
04:18:44,479 --> 04:18:54,479
I'm going to do a heck of a lot. Probably like another potentially like 18 to 20 hours.

2381
04:18:56,000 --> 04:19:05,129
So I have to do this again. The contestant with the bid closest to the actual retail price of the

2382
04:19:05,129 --> 04:19:10,649
item without going over wins the item and gets to come up on stage to play up. And I have some

2383
04:19:10,649 --> 04:19:17,690
digitally downloading the item up for bid. A handsome entertainment cabinet. I think I've

2384
04:19:17,690 --> 04:19:24,170
overshot that as well. Furniture designs by Picasso. American made dark oak entertainment center

2385
04:19:24,170 --> 04:19:30,010
features retractable doors, curio sides and tee tops from furniture designed by Picasso.

2386
04:19:30,969 --> 04:19:38,280
There's about 17 games left. 18 games. Each one of those games will probably take about

2387
04:19:38,280 --> 04:19:43,959
30 to you know between 40 minutes and like two hours is what we've done on each one of these.

2388
04:19:50,090 --> 04:19:53,049
I didn't. I don't know what this was. So we're going to do one dollar.

2389
04:20:00,159 --> 04:20:05,819
Sorry Bob. I wasn't listening to anything you said but I still win.

2390
04:20:06,540 --> 04:20:22,670
You just don't want to go over. Cliffhangers. $16,000. What? Are you serious? Get fucking pumped.

2391
04:20:22,670 --> 04:20:27,069
There's a mountain climber will take one step on the mountain. If he goes too far up the mountain,

2392
04:20:27,069 --> 04:20:32,430
he'll fall off and you'll lose. But if he's still on the path after you bid on the items, you'll win.

2393
04:20:33,149 --> 04:20:38,190
Here's the first item you'll be bidding on. The 80s edition of Soap Opera Challenge.

2394
04:20:38,190 --> 04:20:44,139
It's your drama by the day. Questions about your favorite soap. So you think is the price of this

2395
04:20:44,139 --> 04:20:52,000
item. Enter your bid for this item. It's a soap opera board card game. 19.

2396
04:20:52,879 --> 04:21:00,600
Let me say 19 bucks. I have no way that's more than 25 dollars.

2397
04:21:01,159 --> 04:21:20,440
Do you have the item? No. Let's see how many steps he'll take.

2398
04:21:36,799 --> 04:21:41,840
19. We have Spencer's. Everything children's clothing is meant to be durable easy care

2399
04:21:41,840 --> 04:21:47,200
Spencer's. American made will stand the test of time. What do you think is the price of this item?

2400
04:21:48,000 --> 04:21:54,860
I just want to clarify. I don't even know what this is. That looks like a trash bag, diapers,

2401
04:21:55,659 --> 04:21:59,819
and like a moist towelette case. I don't know what this is. This is clothes.

2402
04:22:00,940 --> 04:22:15,559
40? Is it kids clothing? Like is that like a little onesie? Probably 20. 25.

2403
04:22:18,090 --> 04:22:20,170
No. Let's see how many steps he'll take.

2404
04:22:21,129 --> 04:22:32,750
It's close. All right. Come on. A dog brushing kit.

2405
04:22:38,200 --> 04:22:43,000
You think is the price of this item. Enter your bid for this item. 60. 80.

2406
04:22:46,170 --> 04:23:01,979
60. It's either like it's between 40 and 60. Do you have the item? No. Let's see how many steps

2407
04:23:01,979 --> 04:23:08,969

every single product was four hundred and fifty dollars. Every single one was five hundred bucks.

2466
04:33:11,240 --> 04:33:29,310
You're wrong. Things like that. It's probably two eighty. Fifty, four hundred.

2467
04:33:35,360 --> 04:33:51,389
I had that first time. It's just a thing. Xbox controller. It has four directionals,

2468
04:33:51,389 --> 04:33:54,909
but this button is the same button no matter what. It's every button.

2469
04:33:55,950 --> 04:33:59,630
No matter if it's left, up, right, down, when you press one of these, every single one is pressed.

2470
04:34:01,229 --> 04:34:04,110

2475
04:34:28,599 --> 04:34:35,240
questions, he will show your correct answers on his right hand and your incorrect answers

2476
04:34:35,240 --> 04:34:41,880
in his left hand. If you get three incorrect answers, good luck. And these are the last two

2477
04:34:41,880 --> 04:34:48,520
numbers and the value of the prize. Here's your first question. How many ounces are in a half pint?

2478
04:35:09,610 --> 04:35:19,479
Six. Eight ounces for glass. Eight ounces is a cup. I'm American. I only know as the leaders

2479
04:35:20,279 --> 04:35:32,590
jugs and gallons and I only know as gallons and a gallon is I just know what it looks like. It's

2480
04:35:32,590 --> 04:35:50,029
just like a big a gallon is a pint, a half pint. A pint is 20, 24 ounces. So a half pint would be

2481
04:35:50,029 --> 04:35:58,560
16. No, when you get like when you get a pint, when you get a pint at the bar, that's that's

2482
04:35:58,560 --> 04:36:21,740
20. Is it 21 or 20 ounces? 24. A pint is 16. That's what I'm saying. So it's eight. 1.9 GPA

2483
04:36:21,740 --> 04:36:29,500
was actually 2.7. Nice try though. What do you mean? No, it's not. The value. That's your second

2484
04:36:29,500 --> 04:36:34,810
correct answer. One more and you win. Let's update the score. Here's your next question.

2485
04:36:35,529 --> 04:36:38,729
In baseball, how many runs is a Grand Slam home run?

2486
04:36:39,529 --> 04:37:03,919
Showdown. You'll spin the wheel. If your spin or your combination of two spins is higher than

2487
04:37:03,919 --> 04:37:09,360
the current leader, you'll wonder if you're going to have 75 to 90. Probably 90. If you go,

2488
04:37:09,360 --> 04:37:15,040
if your total, if this is the current leader, beat his score to win. Wow. I can't believe I

2489
04:37:15,040 --> 04:37:23,680
have to go higher than 75 every single time. Oh great. One day I'll be able to go over that number.

2490
04:37:35,689 --> 04:37:43,080
80 please. 15. Your result is lower than, you have to spin the wheel. It's your turn to spin.

2491
04:37:54,430 --> 04:38:03,689
Stop on 70. 70. Yes. You win. Showcase. This is this is the big one. This is the big one.

2492
04:38:15,580 --> 04:38:19,500
Hoomer yells at a video game. There are two showcases up for bid. I mean I've yelled a few

2493
04:38:19,500 --> 04:38:23,180
times. The closest to the actual retail price. You are correct. If your bid is with, let's see

2494
04:38:23,180 --> 04:38:28,299
the first showcase. First showcase coming up. Your showcase begins with a game set.

2495
04:38:29,099 --> 04:38:33,419
If you want to play the game, do it in style. This is two chairs. This is a dinner table. The table

2496
04:38:33,419 --> 04:38:38,220
is a part with solids with an inlaid game surface. The chairs in a screen finish,

2497
04:38:38,220 --> 04:38:45,419
velvet upholstery, and brass hardware. And in the next shop we find this. A platform bed. Made by

2498
04:38:45,419 --> 04:38:50,380
hand. It's just the thing for a small bedroom and can be taken apart for you. The bed is made by

2499
04:38:50,380 --> 04:38:54,619
hand. Accommodates a queen-size mattress. Somebody stuffed it. And there's a range.

2500
04:38:55,419 --> 04:39:01,419
And the only other thing that existed in the 70s is the stove. I would really hate to play

2501
04:39:01,419 --> 04:39:08,380
the Sims back in the 70s. Your house would just be stoves, beds, and wooden chairs.

2502
04:39:17,950 --> 04:39:19,150
That's what it is now.

2503
04:39:25,310 --> 04:39:31,069
All right. Do you want to? No, there's other stuff in the Sims.

2504
04:39:33,069 --> 04:39:43,930
I don't want this one. You do it. 1446. Wow. That's going to really be great.

2505
04:39:43,930 --> 04:39:53,470
Your showcase begins with a new dining room. Table made out of wood. Probably $700 bucks.

2506
04:39:53,470 --> 04:40:00,490
A wood buffet server for side chairs and two armchairs made of veneers and solids.

2507
04:40:00,490 --> 04:40:07,680
And for a lovelier table, there's stoneware. Gourmet brown rich stoneware by Falscraft.

2508
04:40:07,680 --> 04:40:12,240
Handcrafted charm. The ideal in formal settings. Dishwasher safe. Chipper system.

2509
04:40:15,520 --> 04:40:20,090
Hey, what was your showcase? Oh, you know, a table just like yours. I don't rug.

2510
04:40:21,369 --> 04:40:26,330
I wait. I wonder if I'll get a stove too. Oh, I hope so.

2511
04:40:26,330 --> 04:40:39,560
No, mine's way better than yours. Mine is so much cooler than yours.

2512
04:40:40,360 --> 04:40:42,520
Have fun with your wooden stove.

2513
04:40:52,009 --> 04:41:01,209
All right. I'm thinking that's probably at least $1,500 to $2,000 plus $3,000 or $4,000.

2514
04:41:01,209 --> 04:41:07,610
How much do you think your showcase is worth? The table is probably $800.

2515
04:41:08,810 --> 04:41:19,130
The RVs with the motorhome thing, the trailer thing is probably $2,000. $1,500.

2516
04:41:20,490 --> 04:41:23,770
I'm thinking $20,000. And then the carpet is probably $500. I'm thinking $2,800.

2517
04:41:23,770 --> 04:41:37,639
$3,000. $3,000. $3,000. $3,300. $3,000. $3,200. $3,300. $3,200. $3,300. $3,200. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,100. $3,-F explaining.

2518
04:41:37,639 --> 04:41:40,520
$3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,500. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. That's it.

2519
04:41:40,520 --> 04:41:44,360
Okay. You've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth.

2520
04:41:44,360 --> 04:41:47,560
The actual retail price of the second showcase is.

2521
04:41:50,110 --> 04:41:51,150
Oh boy!

2522
04:41:51,150 --> 04:42:04,840
For a difference of. The actual retail price of the first showcase is. Wait. For a difference of. Did I lose?

2523
04:42:04,840 --> 04:42:28,540
Your opponent's been his closest. You don't win anything. I'm gonna fall. I don't know why I did this.

2524
04:42:28,540 --> 04:42:34,610
I have nothing to support me right now. I'm gonna fall down. I'm gonna fall.

2525
04:42:34,610 --> 04:42:41,200
I'm wearing socks. You don't do this in socks. And you don't do this in socks?

2526
04:42:41,200 --> 04:42:46,009
Okay, I gotta go for it. I have to fall. I gotta go for it. One, two, three.

2527
04:42:46,009 --> 04:42:52,389
I couldn't stand up. There's no way. It's impossible.

2528
04:42:52,389 --> 04:43:01,349
You did your best. I did do my best. It's time to do something else.

2529
04:43:01,349 --> 04:43:08,520
So. I've probably got. Just about five hours.

2530
04:43:13,080 --> 04:43:21,439
Let's go for. This is a fan favorite. If I'm gonna do like one, maybe two more.

2531
04:43:21,439 --> 04:43:24,439
This is the fan favorite one we gotta do right now.

2532
04:43:24,439 --> 04:43:53,900
It is not Family Feud. Kung Fu High Impact. Remember this?

2533
04:43:53,900 --> 04:44:09,599
Star Wars? Yeah, I did Star Wars for like an hour and a half earlier.

2534
04:44:09,599 --> 04:44:20,799
Here we go. There's so many more over here.

2535
04:44:20,799 --> 04:44:24,799
But I don't want to just blow through because there's a lot of good stuff over here.

2536
04:44:24,799 --> 04:44:29,299
There's a lot of good stuff in here. A lot of good stuff that we've played already.

2537
04:44:29,299 --> 04:44:35,250
It's time to kick some ass.

2538
04:44:35,250 --> 04:44:48,580
They have this shit for Kinect. And it's probably way better than the one that I played.

2539
04:44:48,580 --> 04:45:03,150
Get a bat over here. I got one.

2540
04:45:03,150 --> 04:45:08,630
Save data must be created. Save it.

2541
04:45:08,630 --> 04:45:13,380
The storage device memory unit will be used. That's fine.

2542
04:45:13,380 --> 04:45:18,959
So I'm gonna get off camera here because I'm just in the game.

2543
04:45:18,959 --> 04:45:21,959
So why would I? There's no reason for me to be on camera.

2544
04:45:21,959 --> 04:45:28,020
Here we go. That, okay. That's not what I wanted to do.

2545
04:45:28,020 --> 04:45:31,860
Uh, close.

2546
04:45:31,860 --> 04:45:41,090
Difficulty normal is fine. Here we go.

2547
04:45:41,090 --> 04:46:06,819
Tell me the story.

2548
04:46:25,040 --> 04:46:29,040
Things of that magnitude do not end easily.

2549
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:36,439
The stories unfinished tend to carry on when you least expect it.

2550
04:46:36,439 --> 04:46:43,709
So it begins.

2551
04:46:43,709 --> 04:46:48,279
Ah, what a nice place.

2552
04:46:48,279 --> 04:46:50,279
How did they get here?

2553
04:46:50,279 --> 04:46:52,279
I didn't think I was supposed to be leaning.

2554
04:46:52,279 --> 04:46:54,279
What was there?

2555
04:46:54,279 --> 04:47:07,880
I don't know, Jeremy. Who is there?

2556
04:47:07,880 --> 04:47:14,599
You gonna do anything else?

2557
04:47:14,599 --> 04:47:16,599
Stretch before playing to prevent aching muscles.

2558
04:47:16,599 --> 04:47:19,770
Well, why didn't you tell me that like six hours ago?

2559
04:47:19,770 --> 04:47:29,860
Oh, Mike, that's where my whole body hurts right now.

2560
04:47:29,860 --> 04:47:35,169
Round one. Is that me?

2561
04:47:35,169 --> 04:47:38,729
Welcome to Kung Fu High Impact.

2562
04:47:38,729 --> 04:47:43,119
Are you ready to kick some serious ass?

2563
04:47:43,119 --> 04:47:45,119
Let's go through a few tricks.

2564
04:47:45,119 --> 04:47:47,119
That's the clothes I was wearing yesterday.

2565
04:47:47,119 --> 04:47:50,119
Enemies are to your left and right.

2566
04:47:50,119 --> 04:47:52,619
Fight in your own style. They sure are.

2567
04:47:52,619 --> 04:47:55,619
All moves deal damage as long as they're fast enough.

2568
04:47:55,619 --> 04:48:00,799
Like this guy over here.

2569
04:48:00,799 --> 04:48:04,299
Hey, how are ya?

2570
04:48:04,299 --> 04:48:10,169
Sorry about that.

2571
04:48:10,169 --> 04:48:12,169
Why am I so tiny?

2572
04:48:12,169 --> 04:48:14,169
I really should be taller.

2573
04:48:14,169 --> 04:48:16,169
Is it not correct?

2574
04:48:16,169 --> 04:48:26,880
It's not correct. The Kinect is in a wrong spot.

2575
04:48:26,880 --> 04:48:32,290
Hey, guys. Check this out.

2576
04:48:32,290 --> 04:48:40,740
I gotta umbre calibrating this.

2577
04:48:40,740 --> 04:48:43,740
I need to be like fucking three feet taller.

2578
04:48:43,740 --> 04:48:45,740
See, the Kinect doesn't even have my feet. Look it.

2579
04:48:45,740 --> 04:48:47,740
Look it. See?

2580
04:48:47,740 --> 04:48:49,740
Look. It's cutting me off.

2581
04:48:49,740 --> 04:48:52,740
I don't even have shins.

2582
04:48:52,740 --> 04:48:54,740
Look.

2583
04:48:59,560 --> 04:49:13,860
Got him.

2584
04:49:18,860 --> 04:49:22,250
You got it.

2585
04:49:22,250 --> 04:49:25,250
Dodge, jump, punch, double punch.

2586
04:49:25,250 --> 04:49:51,479
Get out of here.

2587
04:49:51,479 --> 04:49:52,479
Where is he?

2588
04:49:52,479 --> 04:49:53,970
No!

2589
04:49:53,970 --> 04:50:04,279
Round four.

2590
04:50:04,279 --> 04:50:06,279
I'm gonna go this way.

2591
04:50:09,580 --> 04:50:11,580
That's so awesome.

2592
04:50:11,580 --> 04:50:13,580
I have to get to the options.

2593
04:50:18,139 --> 04:50:23,069
So you have to dodge.

2594
04:50:23,069 --> 04:50:33,159
Block. Nice.

2595
04:50:33,159 --> 04:50:43,759
So I have to ju- I can't dodge red.

2596
04:50:43,759 --> 04:50:48,400
Did I get it?

2597
04:50:48,400 --> 04:50:50,400
I'm gonna cartwheel into him, motherfucker.

2598
04:50:50,400 --> 04:50:52,959
I swear to God.

2599
04:50:58,959 --> 04:51:03,159
That's what I do, is this.

2600
04:51:05,159 --> 04:51:14,400
Here we go.

2601
04:51:14,400 --> 04:51:15,400
Come here.

2602
04:51:15,400 --> 04:51:29,639
I saw more. I'm a big fan of the one, two, three.

2603
04:51:29,639 --> 04:51:35,470
Alright. I need to take-

2604
04:51:35,470 --> 04:51:38,840
I gotta get the Kinect to fix itself.

2605
04:51:38,840 --> 04:51:49,270
Gamer picture? Where?

2606
04:51:49,270 --> 04:51:54,000
What? What?

2607
04:51:54,000 --> 04:52:27,549
What?

2608
04:52:36,069 --> 04:52:38,069
Let's look at my headband.

2609
04:53:01,919 --> 04:53:02,919
Looks ordinary.

2610
04:53:02,919 --> 04:53:05,919
But believe me, I've seen the strange powers these comics have.

2611
04:53:05,919 --> 04:53:11,919
Yeah, I guess you could say working for a wizard has its own twists and turns.

2612
04:53:13,229 --> 04:53:33,560
What the fuck is the sound of this?

2613
04:53:33,560 --> 04:53:34,560
Here we go.

2614
04:53:34,560 --> 04:53:39,470
It's time to be a fighter.

2615
04:53:39,470 --> 04:53:41,470
Take control of the battlefield and use power punch.

2616
04:53:41,470 --> 04:53:43,470
The faster you move from side to side, the more distance you cover in the game.

2617
04:53:43,470 --> 04:53:53,680
Kicks and punches also move you forward.

2618
04:53:53,680 --> 04:53:57,680
Use somersaults to reach higher platforms or escape danger.

2619
04:53:57,680 --> 04:53:59,680
You can even surprise your enemies from behind.

2620
04:53:59,680 --> 04:54:00,680
How do I do that?

2621
04:54:00,680 --> 04:54:05,180
All at once. Jump, throw your hands up, and bend.

2622
04:54:07,889 --> 04:54:11,599
I need new legs.

2623
04:54:11,599 --> 04:54:15,639
Why did my parents say that to me?

2624
04:54:15,639 --> 04:54:19,759
What happened?

2625
04:54:19,759 --> 04:54:25,860
See.

2626
04:54:25,860 --> 04:54:35,740
Oh, I gotta go this way.

2627
04:54:35,740 --> 04:54:50,229
Power ups?

2628
04:54:50,229 --> 04:54:59,830
Where's there- is there-

2629
04:55:01,830 --> 04:55:06,400
Why did it not work?

2630
04:55:12,080 --> 04:55:21,319
I just stomped him.

2631
04:55:21,319 --> 04:55:23,319
Alright, my headphones came off.

2632
04:55:23,319 --> 04:55:24,319
Stop boring out.

2633
04:55:24,319 --> 04:55:27,810
Use power punch to slam the doors shut.

2634
04:55:27,810 --> 04:55:44,479
I gotta block.

2635
04:55:44,479 --> 04:55:48,439
I gotta remember to block.

2636
04:55:48,439 --> 04:56:01,819
Power punch, shut the doors.

2637
04:56:01,819 --> 04:56:03,819
I just taunted when I wasn't supposed to.

2638
04:56:03,819 --> 04:56:14,189
You can't taunt.

2639
04:56:14,189 --> 04:56:31,450
I'm almost dead.

2640
04:56:31,450 --> 04:56:32,450
Check this move out.

2641
04:56:32,450 --> 04:56:35,139
These guys just keep boring out.

2642
04:56:35,139 --> 04:56:37,380
Use power punch to slam doors shut.

2643
04:56:37,380 --> 04:56:44,419
I'm trying to close the door.

2644
04:56:45,419 --> 04:56:46,849
Alright, I got it.

2645
04:56:46,849 --> 04:56:47,849
Door closed.

2646
04:56:47,849 --> 04:56:57,130
They've gotten out of that one.

2647
04:56:57,130 --> 04:56:58,130
Which way are they coming?

2648
04:56:58,130 --> 04:57:02,060
Is it the guy in the frame?

2649
04:57:19,169 --> 04:57:25,790
Oh, my stomach.

2650
04:58:11,549 --> 04:58:14,389
Come on over here.

2651
04:58:14,389 --> 04:58:15,389
Why don't you-

2652
04:58:15,389 --> 04:58:42,869
Hey!

2653
04:58:42,869 --> 04:59:01,259
Close the door.

2654
04:59:01,259 --> 04:59:04,799
Do a backflip.

2655
04:59:04,799 --> 04:59:21,599
I did it.

2656
04:59:21,599 --> 04:59:24,880
Do a backflip.

2657
04:59:24,880 --> 04:59:25,880
Jesus.

2658
04:59:25,880 --> 04:59:49,700
Ow.

2659
04:59:49,700 --> 04:59:50,700
Ow.

2660
04:59:50,700 --> 04:59:51,700
Ow.

2661
04:59:51,700 --> 04:59:52,700
Ow.

2662
04:59:52,700 --> 05:00:14,569
Oh, I gotta close that.

2663
05:00:14,569 --> 05:00:15,569
Power punch.

2664
05:00:15,569 --> 05:00:16,569
Power punch.

2665
05:00:16,569 --> 05:00:17,569
Power punch.

2666
05:00:17,569 --> 05:00:21,630
Close.

2667
05:00:21,630 --> 05:00:22,630
This.

2668
05:00:22,630 --> 05:00:23,799
Fucking.

2669
05:00:23,799 --> 05:00:24,799
Door.

2670
05:00:24,799 --> 05:00:25,799
Door.

2671
05:00:29,000 --> 05:00:45,729
See ya.

2672
05:00:45,729 --> 05:01:08,200
The Irish stanchion technique.

2673
05:01:08,200 --> 05:01:09,200
Close it.

2674
05:01:09,200 --> 05:01:12,360
You.

2675
05:01:12,360 --> 05:01:24,919
Close it.

2676
05:01:24,919 --> 05:01:25,919
No.

2677
05:02:03,709 --> 05:02:21,830
Close it.

2678
05:02:21,830 --> 05:02:24,279
Up.

2679
05:02:24,279 --> 05:02:29,430
Other way.

2680
05:02:29,430 --> 05:02:31,049
Backwards.

2681
05:02:31,049 --> 05:02:33,439
Back.

2682
05:02:33,439 --> 05:02:43,200
Forward.

2683
05:02:43,200 --> 05:02:45,009
Get up there.

2684
05:02:45,009 --> 05:02:46,009
Oh, I just caught real-

2685
05:02:46,009 --> 05:03:13,709
God damn it.

2686
05:03:13,709 --> 05:03:14,709
Get.

2687
05:03:16,840 --> 05:03:17,840
Get over there.

2688
05:03:17,840 --> 05:03:19,790
Up.

2689
05:03:19,790 --> 05:03:27,169
Go.

2690
05:03:27,169 --> 05:03:28,409
Go forward.

2691
05:03:31,439 --> 05:03:34,479
Get.

2692
05:03:34,479 --> 05:03:36,479
Oh, my God.

2693
05:03:36,479 --> 05:04:05,240
Don't do it.

2694
05:04:05,240 --> 05:04:27,790
I'm fine.

2695
05:04:27,790 --> 05:04:41,040
Go drink some water.

2696
05:04:41,040 --> 05:04:42,040
What?

2697
05:05:08,279 --> 05:05:12,459
It worked.

2698
05:05:12,459 --> 05:05:13,459
Stay down.

2699
05:05:13,459 --> 05:05:16,810
Whoa.

2700
05:05:16,810 --> 05:05:19,810
It was like a Halloween party gone seriously wrong.

2701
05:05:19,810 --> 05:05:27,680
Thanks, guys, but I have to skip the party and get back to work.

2702
05:05:27,680 --> 05:05:35,810
Same freaks.

2703
05:05:35,810 --> 05:05:37,810
Hey, I worked there.

2704
05:05:37,810 --> 05:05:38,810
Cut it out.

2705
05:05:38,810 --> 05:06:11,349
Bonus items.

2706
05:06:11,349 --> 05:06:15,779
These mystic stones contain health or special powers.

2707
05:06:15,779 --> 05:06:19,150
Smash them to get to the goodies inside.

2708
05:06:22,049 --> 05:06:25,849
Ah.

2709
05:06:25,849 --> 05:06:26,849
Great.

2710
05:06:27,849 --> 05:06:28,849
Excuse you.

2711
05:06:34,509 --> 05:06:35,509
Goodies?

2712
05:06:35,509 --> 05:06:36,509
Where are they?

2713
05:06:36,509 --> 05:06:51,119
In here?

2714
05:06:51,119 --> 05:07:06,189
I'm the best still.

2715
05:07:06,189 --> 05:07:07,189
Double up cut.

2716
05:07:07,189 --> 05:07:09,189
I gotta utilize the up cut more often.

2717
05:07:09,189 --> 05:07:22,049
Double front head.

2718
05:07:22,049 --> 05:07:44,599
Adopted feet.

2719
05:07:45,599 --> 05:07:47,040
Nice.

2720
05:07:47,040 --> 05:07:53,240
Back to sneak into the alley.

2721
05:07:53,240 --> 05:07:56,889
What happens if I make myself, like, just tiny?

2722
05:07:56,889 --> 05:07:58,889
And they, like, not touch me?

2723
05:08:15,880 --> 05:08:50,139
This tank is empty.

2724
05:08:50,139 --> 05:08:54,709
I don't have any most...

2725
05:08:54,709 --> 05:09:00,810
I'm out of gas.

2726
05:09:00,810 --> 05:09:03,240
I don't have to...

2727
05:09:03,240 --> 05:09:21,319
Oh.

2728
05:09:21,319 --> 05:09:33,500
Kick him.

2729
05:09:33,500 --> 05:09:35,569
I can't hear anybody.

2730
05:09:35,569 --> 05:09:40,330
I need a...

2731
05:09:40,330 --> 05:09:41,569
I need health.

2732
05:09:41,569 --> 05:09:47,159
Where's their health?

2733
05:09:47,159 --> 05:09:48,159
Did I get it?

2734
05:09:48,159 --> 05:09:49,159
Who the fuck is that?

2735
05:09:49,159 --> 05:09:59,240
Wait.

2736
05:09:59,240 --> 05:10:00,240
Let's talk about this.

2737
05:10:00,240 --> 05:10:20,849
You don't know.

2738
05:10:20,849 --> 05:10:25,180
On call four.

2739
05:10:25,180 --> 05:10:26,180
What?

2740
05:10:26,180 --> 05:10:34,840
What?

2741
05:10:34,840 --> 05:10:43,959
What are you doing?

2742
05:10:43,959 --> 05:10:44,959
What the fuck?

2743
05:11:03,799 --> 05:11:04,799
Bonus items.

2744
05:11:04,799 --> 05:11:08,799
These mystic stones contain health or special powers.

2745
05:11:08,799 --> 05:11:12,040
Smash them to get to the goodies inside.

2746
05:11:15,000 --> 05:11:17,630
Thanks for coming to the stream.

2747
05:11:17,630 --> 05:11:20,930
I'll see you guys when we're playing Ancestors.

2748
05:11:21,930 --> 05:11:24,130
Nice.

2749
05:11:25,130 --> 05:11:26,819
Get off me.

2750
05:11:26,819 --> 05:11:27,819
I'm trying to talk.

2751
05:11:27,819 --> 05:11:28,819
I'm trying to do my outro.

2752
05:11:42,729 --> 05:11:43,729
Oh no.

2753
05:11:43,729 --> 05:11:45,729
It's a child temper tantrum.

2754
05:11:45,729 --> 05:11:46,729
It's working.

2755
05:11:57,740 --> 05:11:58,740
Energy.

2756
05:12:01,959 --> 05:12:03,970
Rekindle.

2757
05:12:04,970 --> 05:12:11,520
You guys have seen...

2758
05:12:12,520 --> 05:12:15,529
You guys have seen Kingpin.

2759
05:12:15,529 --> 05:12:21,560
When Big Earth McCracken is bowling his ass off.

2760
05:12:21,560 --> 05:12:25,869
His, like, wig is just all over the place.

2761
05:12:26,869 --> 05:12:54,630
I gotta get this boss.

2762
05:12:54,630 --> 05:13:14,279
I'm really fighting.

2763
05:13:14,279 --> 05:13:15,279
Okay.

2764
05:13:15,279 --> 05:13:16,279
Time for a weapon.

2765
05:13:16,279 --> 05:13:36,520
Not helping.

2766
05:13:36,520 --> 05:13:37,520
It's too heavy.

2767
05:13:37,520 --> 05:13:43,090
Get that obelisk.

2768
05:13:43,090 --> 05:14:08,049
They can't hit what they can't see.

2769
05:14:34,250 --> 05:14:56,459
You know that guy you see in the gym sometimes

2770
05:14:56,459 --> 05:14:58,459
that's there for three and a half hours?

2771
05:14:58,459 --> 05:15:01,459
And he's, like, literally waters coming down from his body?

2772
05:15:01,459 --> 05:15:04,889
At two and a half hours under that guy.

2773
05:15:04,889 --> 05:15:08,889
I am stronger than the fucking huge guy in the gym

2774
05:15:08,889 --> 05:15:10,889
that does cardio for three and a half hours.

2775
05:15:10,889 --> 05:15:12,889
I'm stronger than that guy.

2776
05:15:20,279 --> 05:15:21,279
Hold on.

2777
05:15:21,279 --> 05:15:22,279
Where's my mushroom?

2778
05:15:23,959 --> 05:15:24,959
There's one.

2779
05:15:25,959 --> 05:15:26,959
What?

2780
05:15:27,959 --> 05:15:31,189
I tried.

2781
05:15:31,189 --> 05:15:33,189
I tried to make the mushroom sound.

2782
05:15:46,009 --> 05:15:47,009
It just ate Toad.

2783
05:15:55,549 --> 05:15:57,939
Get out of here.

2784
05:16:18,700 --> 05:16:36,200
Hey.

2785
05:16:36,200 --> 05:16:37,200
Why is that somehow worse?

2786
05:16:54,310 --> 05:16:55,740
I heard a crack.

2787
05:16:56,740 --> 05:17:03,880
Aim the camera down or push it back so you can get your legs in.

2788
05:17:04,880 --> 05:17:06,880
The Kinect has, like, a mind of its own.

2789
05:17:07,880 --> 05:17:13,279
I'm doing better.

2790
05:17:24,380 --> 05:17:25,380
Do you have to be strong to play this?

2791
05:17:25,380 --> 05:17:26,380
Yeah.

2792
05:17:26,380 --> 05:17:28,840
Strong enough.

2793
05:17:34,529 --> 05:17:40,380
That's a good technique.

2794
05:17:40,380 --> 05:17:42,380
The fucking, like, octopus hands.

2795
05:17:42,380 --> 05:17:53,240
Or, like, the directing symphony, whichever one you want to call it.

2796
05:17:53,240 --> 05:18:15,400
Put me thrash.

2797
05:18:15,400 --> 05:18:16,400
What?

2798
05:18:16,400 --> 05:18:26,779
Oh.

2799
05:18:26,779 --> 05:18:27,779
Get out of here.

2800
05:18:27,779 --> 05:18:49,180
I just kicked his ass.

2801
05:18:49,180 --> 05:18:50,180
Pee-pee-poo-poo.

2802
05:19:31,799 --> 05:19:32,799
Chapter four.

2803
05:19:32,799 --> 05:19:33,799
Helmet blunder.

2804
05:19:33,799 --> 05:19:39,689
Who are these guys?

2805
05:19:39,689 --> 05:19:43,380
They sure don't look like your ordinary comic book fans.

2806
05:19:44,680 --> 05:19:46,680
Okay, let's figure this out.

2807
05:19:46,680 --> 05:19:50,310
Anyway, warn me about something before she left.

2808
05:19:52,060 --> 05:19:54,060
Here's a list of tasks for you to do.

2809
05:19:54,060 --> 05:19:56,060
I feel like I shouldn't even be in the scene.

2810
05:19:56,060 --> 05:19:58,060
Especially the last one.

2811
05:19:59,060 --> 05:20:01,880
See, I'm pretty sure I did everything.

2812
05:20:03,689 --> 05:20:04,689
Save the world.

2813
05:20:04,689 --> 05:20:05,689
Check.

2814
05:20:05,689 --> 05:20:06,689
Clean up.

2815
05:20:06,689 --> 05:20:07,689
Check.

2816
05:20:07,689 --> 05:20:08,689
Destroy Kuang's helmet.

2817
05:20:09,689 --> 05:20:11,689
Destroy Kuang's helmet!

2818
05:20:11,689 --> 05:20:12,689
Oh, crap.

2819
05:20:12,689 --> 05:20:14,689
It's still in the basement.

2820
05:20:14,689 --> 05:20:17,319
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

2821
05:20:17,319 --> 05:20:19,319
Those guys might have nothing to do with the helmet.

2822
05:20:19,319 --> 05:20:23,669
Doesn't look like much.

2823
05:20:23,669 --> 05:20:27,700
Let's get the job done.

2824
05:20:30,220 --> 05:20:31,220
I'll take that.

2825
05:20:31,220 --> 05:20:32,220
What?

2826
05:20:32,220 --> 05:20:37,810
Who the heck are you?

2827
05:20:37,810 --> 05:20:47,759
Kron?

2828
05:20:47,759 --> 05:20:49,759
I'm assuming this is a boss fight.

2829
05:20:49,759 --> 05:20:57,009
All right, I can take...

2830
05:20:57,009 --> 05:20:58,009
I can get...

2831
05:20:58,009 --> 05:20:59,009
I can beat this boss.

2832
05:20:59,009 --> 05:21:15,380
I have faith.

2833
05:21:15,380 --> 05:21:16,880
Backing off?

2834
05:21:16,880 --> 05:21:17,880
Don't matter.

2835
05:21:17,880 --> 05:21:19,369
Stay down.

2836
05:21:19,369 --> 05:21:28,520
I'm not gonna take a fucking hit.

2837
05:21:28,520 --> 05:21:32,580
Set the back one!

2838
05:21:32,580 --> 05:21:34,580
That's the only one you get!

2839
05:21:34,580 --> 05:22:01,040
Back breaker.

2840
05:22:01,040 --> 05:22:16,799
Sidekick.

2841
05:22:16,799 --> 05:22:17,799
Bingo.

2842
05:22:17,799 --> 05:22:41,889
Full health.

2843
05:22:41,889 --> 05:22:42,889
We're good.

2844
05:22:42,889 --> 05:22:47,779
Fuck out of here.

2845
05:22:47,779 --> 05:22:55,139
Oh, I just got combo'd.

2846
05:22:55,139 --> 05:23:12,119
Not bad.

2847
05:23:12,119 --> 05:23:13,119
I like the bouncing ball technique.

2848
05:23:13,119 --> 05:23:14,119
It's pretty good.

2849
05:23:14,119 --> 05:23:16,450
Checkpoint.

2850
05:23:16,450 --> 05:23:22,900
New pound shaker.

2851
05:23:22,900 --> 05:23:28,659
Pound shaker may not do much damage, but it throws your enemies off.

2852
05:23:28,659 --> 05:23:32,659
It can also damage particularly sturdy enemies.

2853
05:23:32,659 --> 05:23:34,090
All right.

2854
05:23:34,090 --> 05:23:36,090
Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.

2855
05:23:36,090 --> 05:23:46,090
Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.

2856
05:23:46,090 --> 05:23:56,229
Even that move don't work.

2857
05:23:56,229 --> 05:24:00,229
Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.

2858
05:24:00,229 --> 05:24:08,060
Shit.

2859
05:24:08,060 --> 05:24:09,560
It's shredder.

2860
05:24:09,560 --> 05:24:18,799
Ow.

2861
05:24:18,799 --> 05:24:19,799
Ow.

2862
05:24:19,799 --> 05:24:20,799
Ow.

2863
05:24:20,799 --> 05:24:21,799
Idiot.

2864
05:24:21,799 --> 05:24:22,799
Stupid idiot.

2865
05:24:22,799 --> 05:24:28,880
Mom's gonna kill you when she finds out you took my car.

2866
05:24:28,880 --> 05:24:29,880
I destroy him.

2867
05:24:29,880 --> 05:24:32,650
I bet you think Rob Schneider is funny.

2868
05:24:32,650 --> 05:24:33,650
Yeah, I do.

2869
05:24:33,650 --> 05:24:34,650
That's a pretty good bet.

2870
05:24:34,650 --> 05:24:35,650
I can do this one.

2871
05:24:35,650 --> 05:24:36,650
Chapter five.

2872
05:24:36,650 --> 05:24:37,650
Eye of the Dragon.

2873
05:24:37,650 --> 05:24:57,840
Oh, man.

2874
05:24:57,840 --> 05:24:58,840
You scared the crap out of me.

2875
05:24:58,840 --> 05:24:59,840
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2876
05:24:59,840 --> 05:25:42,930
Oh, man.

2877
05:25:42,930 --> 05:25:43,930
You scared the crap out of me.

2878
05:25:43,930 --> 05:25:44,930
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2879
05:25:44,930 --> 05:25:53,150
Oh, man.

2880
05:25:53,150 --> 05:25:54,150
You scared the crap out of me.

2881
05:25:54,150 --> 05:25:55,709
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2882
05:25:55,709 --> 05:26:16,849
Oh, man.

2883
05:26:16,849 --> 05:26:17,849
You scared the crap out of me.

2884
05:26:17,849 --> 05:26:22,869
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2885
05:26:22,869 --> 05:26:23,869
Oh, man.

2886
05:26:23,869 --> 05:26:26,130
You scared the crap out of me.

2887
05:26:26,130 --> 05:26:27,130
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2888
05:26:27,130 --> 05:26:31,250
Oh, man.

2889
05:26:31,250 --> 05:26:44,970
You scared the crap out of me.

2890
05:26:44,970 --> 05:27:24,740
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2891
05:27:24,740 --> 05:27:25,740
Oh, man.

2892
05:27:25,740 --> 05:27:26,740
You scared the crap out of me.

2893
05:27:38,740 --> 05:27:39,740
Oh, man.

2894
05:27:39,740 --> 05:27:41,169
You scared the crap out of me.

2895
05:27:41,169 --> 05:27:42,169
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2896
05:27:42,169 --> 05:27:43,169
Oh, man.

2897
05:27:43,169 --> 05:27:44,169
You scared the crap out of me.

2898
05:27:44,169 --> 05:27:45,169
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2899
05:27:45,169 --> 05:27:46,540
Oh, man.

2900
05:27:46,540 --> 05:27:47,540
You scared the crap out of me.

2901
05:27:47,540 --> 05:27:48,540
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2902
05:27:48,540 --> 05:27:49,540
Oh, man.

2903
05:27:49,540 --> 05:27:50,540
You scared the crap out of me.

2904
05:27:50,540 --> 05:27:51,540
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2905
05:27:51,540 --> 05:27:52,970
Oh, man.

2906
05:27:52,970 --> 05:27:53,970
You scared the crap out of me.

2907
05:27:53,970 --> 05:27:54,970
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2908
05:27:54,970 --> 05:27:55,970
Oh, man.

2909
05:27:55,970 --> 05:27:56,970
You scared the crap out of me.

2910
05:27:56,970 --> 05:27:57,970
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2911
05:27:57,970 --> 05:28:01,450
Oh, man.

2912
05:28:01,450 --> 05:28:02,450
You scared the crap out of me.

2913
05:28:02,450 --> 05:28:03,450
I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.

2914
05:28:04,450 --> 05:28:06,450
I'm going to become the Lich King.

2915
05:28:30,159 --> 05:28:31,159
Not a promotion in that one.

2916
05:28:31,159 --> 05:28:32,159
Better done better than that.

2917
05:28:56,840 --> 05:28:59,840
I feel like I've been in that position like three or four times today.

2918
05:28:59,840 --> 05:29:02,659
My body is emanating heat.

2919
05:29:02,659 --> 05:29:10,659
We're going to have to go with a new strategy.

2920
05:29:10,659 --> 05:29:23,779
Probably lost five pounds today.

2921
05:29:23,779 --> 05:29:24,779
No.

2922
05:29:24,779 --> 05:29:27,659
I need a new strat.

2923
05:29:27,659 --> 05:29:30,689
Oh, right there.

2924
05:29:30,689 --> 05:29:33,689
They're not going to be able to hit me because I'm disappearing.

2925
05:29:33,689 --> 05:30:02,389
Much easier.

2926
05:30:02,389 --> 05:30:16,490
What do you got?

2927
05:30:16,490 --> 05:30:24,080
Well, I should have been doing this from the beginning.

2928
05:30:24,080 --> 05:30:32,529
It's permanent Liu Kang.

2929
05:30:32,529 --> 05:30:34,959
I unlocked the secret.

2930
05:30:34,959 --> 05:30:46,060
Woo.

2931
05:30:46,060 --> 05:31:02,979
I remember this part.

2932
05:31:02,979 --> 05:31:12,319
Did I do the same joke last time?

2933
05:31:12,319 --> 05:31:14,319
I think I may have.

2934
05:31:14,319 --> 05:31:45,659
This is the best defense if you have like an older brother.

2935
05:31:46,659 --> 05:31:49,659
This is the little brother defense against the older brother.

2936
05:31:49,659 --> 05:31:51,840
I used to do it all the time.

2937
05:31:51,840 --> 05:31:55,360
You just go like this.

2938
05:31:55,360 --> 05:31:56,360
And they're going to be able to get you.

2939
05:31:56,360 --> 05:32:25,520
I almost just ripped my pants.

2940
05:32:25,520 --> 05:32:43,720
Did they rip?

2941
05:32:43,720 --> 05:32:49,720
Can you imagine if I went like this and it split right in the middle on camera?

2942
05:32:49,720 --> 05:32:51,720
That would be really bad.

2943
05:32:51,720 --> 05:32:57,290
Like just just like boom.

2944
05:32:57,290 --> 05:32:58,290
Oh my God.

2945
05:32:58,290 --> 05:32:59,290
That would be.

2946
05:32:59,290 --> 05:33:00,290
You know, I would accept it.

2947
05:33:00,290 --> 05:33:02,290
I would accept defeat at that point.

2948
05:33:15,759 --> 05:33:18,020
Not wearing underwear yet.

2949
05:33:18,020 --> 05:33:19,020
Why?

2950
05:33:19,020 --> 05:33:20,020
What are you talking about?

2951
05:33:20,020 --> 05:33:21,389
What?

2952
05:33:21,389 --> 05:33:26,389
My pants are going to rip in the middle and then like my all my shit is going to come out.

2953
05:33:26,389 --> 05:33:56,529
Dude, I'll give it to people that get sick.

2954
05:33:56,529 --> 05:33:59,529
I mean, obviously I've been doing this for like six hours or so.

2955
05:33:59,529 --> 05:34:02,709
But imagine starting this shit.

2956
05:34:02,709 --> 05:34:06,709
This game is just you're constantly moving around.

2957
05:34:06,709 --> 05:34:08,709
Forget about like Zumba class.

2958
05:34:08,709 --> 05:34:09,709
Just go get this.

2959
05:34:09,709 --> 05:34:11,709
Go download it.

2960
05:34:11,709 --> 05:34:12,709
Still on the Xbox Store.

2961
05:34:12,709 --> 05:34:14,709
Go get it.

2962
05:34:14,709 --> 05:34:15,709
You want to work out?

2963
05:34:15,709 --> 05:34:16,709
Go sit, sit chair.

2964
05:34:16,709 --> 05:34:17,709
Put your legs up.

2965
05:34:17,709 --> 05:34:28,459
Rip your pants in half.

2966
05:34:28,459 --> 05:34:33,880
I'm up for this one.

2967
05:34:33,880 --> 05:35:27,810
There's hair in my mouth still from like an hour and a half ago.

2968
05:35:27,810 --> 05:35:28,810
Is the chair fighting?

2969
05:35:28,810 --> 05:35:37,259
Come on, get him chair.

2970
05:35:37,259 --> 05:35:38,819
You can do it.

2971
05:35:38,819 --> 05:35:44,709
It's like Dr. Strain.

2972
05:35:44,709 --> 05:35:57,529
Back it up.

2973
05:35:57,529 --> 05:36:12,119
Ah, you tried.

2974
05:36:12,119 --> 05:36:13,119
You tried.

2975
05:36:13,119 --> 05:36:18,759
Chair is doing better than me.

2976
05:36:18,759 --> 05:36:28,439
Shred the chair.

2977
05:36:28,439 --> 05:36:30,439
No, I'm not going to shred this game.

2978
05:36:30,439 --> 05:36:41,220
I'm going to have to go get some water.

2979
05:36:41,220 --> 05:36:45,869
And then we're going to we're going to have to just kind of chill.

2980
05:36:45,869 --> 05:36:50,770
This is where I tap out at six hours.

2981
05:36:50,770 --> 05:36:53,770
I've punched the air probably six to seven thousand times.

2982
05:36:53,770 --> 05:37:06,040
This is so fun though.

2983
05:37:06,040 --> 05:37:08,860
This is supposed to be a 12 hour stream.

2984
05:37:08,860 --> 05:37:14,040
No way.

2985
05:37:14,040 --> 05:37:25,580
If I don't get like in the shower in the next like 40 minutes, you will see a guy pass out on stream.

2986
05:37:25,580 --> 05:37:26,580
Shred the chair.

2987
05:37:26,580 --> 05:37:27,580
Why would I shred my chair?

2988
05:37:27,580 --> 05:37:28,580
I love my chair.

2989
05:37:28,580 --> 05:37:34,069
It's a great chair.

2990
05:37:34,069 --> 05:37:36,880
So here's the here's the plan.

2991
05:37:36,880 --> 05:37:38,880
These these games are really, really fun.

2992
05:37:38,880 --> 05:37:44,250
And I spent more time in some of them than I thought, which I knew was probably the case.

2993
05:37:44,250 --> 05:37:51,840
There are a couple of really, really great ones still.

2994
05:37:51,840 --> 05:37:53,840
There's like 10 that are still around.

2995
05:37:53,840 --> 05:37:59,479
So we're going to do another.

2996
05:37:59,479 --> 05:38:01,479
We're just going to do more Connect.

2997
05:38:01,479 --> 05:38:03,479
We're just going to not now.

2998
05:38:03,479 --> 05:38:05,479
Not this week.

2999
05:38:05,479 --> 05:38:10,479
We're going to put it in the box till next week because Ancestors comes out on Tuesday.

3000
05:38:10,479 --> 05:38:12,479
And that's what I want to do next.

3001
05:38:12,479 --> 05:38:17,700
That evolution ape game.

3002
05:38:17,700 --> 05:38:20,700
It seems really, really just ridiculous.

3003
05:38:20,700 --> 05:38:22,700
I'm going to play that for probably a day or so.

3004
05:38:22,700 --> 05:38:33,279
We're going to start the next Connect stream with Rise of Nightmares because that is absolutely going to be like a two to three hour experience.

3005
05:38:33,279 --> 05:38:41,000
At least it's a full game.

3006
05:38:41,000 --> 05:38:47,659
So we'll probably actually do that this coming weekend because let me think about this.

3007
05:38:47,659 --> 05:38:49,659
So Tuesday, I'm going to Ancestors.

3008
05:38:49,659 --> 05:38:55,159
And then maybe we could do Thursday or Friday.

3009
05:38:55,159 --> 05:38:57,849
Maybe because Saturday we're doing upset.

3010
05:38:57,849 --> 05:38:59,849
We're finishing Terraria on Saturday.

3011
05:38:59,849 --> 05:39:01,849
Star and I were going to do the base game.

3012
05:39:01,849 --> 05:39:02,849
We're going to complete it.

3013
05:39:02,849 --> 05:39:10,790
So I don't maybe like Sunday.

3014
05:39:10,790 --> 05:39:15,790
We'll do like a horror thing on Sunday because this two horror games for the Connect that I'm going to do.

3015
05:39:15,790 --> 05:39:19,090
Haunt and then Rise of Nightmares.

3016
05:39:19,090 --> 05:39:21,720
They both apparently really interesting.

3017
05:39:21,720 --> 05:39:24,400
So but I got some water.

3018
05:39:24,400 --> 05:39:26,400
I got a clock out here.

3019
05:39:26,400 --> 05:39:27,900
We'll come back.

3020
05:39:27,900 --> 05:39:28,900
I'll hang up for a little bit.

3021
05:39:28,900 --> 05:39:29,900
We'll do the bits.

3022
05:39:29,900 --> 05:39:31,400
We'll talk.

3023
05:39:31,400 --> 05:39:36,360
We'll probably be done in about six, six and a half hours or so.

3024
05:39:36,360 --> 05:39:37,360
So I will see you guys.

3025
05:39:37,360 --> 05:39:38,360
Have you taken off?

3026
05:39:38,360 --> 05:39:44,200
I'll see you guys on Tuesday for Ancestors.

3027
05:39:44,200 --> 05:39:48,360
That's the day it launches on PC.

3028
05:39:48,360 --> 05:39:49,360
I'll be right back.

3029
05:39:49,360 --> 05:39:51,860
I'm going to get some water.

3030
05:39:51,860 --> 05:42:02,959
All right.

3031
05:42:02,959 --> 05:42:08,439
So again, if you're sticking around, I will see you on Tuesday.

3032
05:42:08,439 --> 05:42:10,759
Today's Sunday.

3033
05:42:10,759 --> 05:42:12,759
So I won't be streaming tomorrow.

3034
05:42:12,759 --> 05:42:13,759
I'll see you on Tuesday.

3035
05:42:13,759 --> 05:42:19,520
The stream was shorter than I expected.

3036
05:42:19,520 --> 05:42:20,520
I drank a battery for no reason.

3037
05:42:20,520 --> 05:42:22,520
Why would you ever have a battery for lunch?

3038
05:42:22,520 --> 05:42:26,639
I'll do that.

3039
05:42:26,639 --> 05:42:27,639
That's a bad idea.

3040
05:42:27,639 --> 05:42:33,159
That's that I would advise against ever doing something like that.

3041
05:42:33,159 --> 05:42:40,459
So let's do the bits.

3042
05:42:40,459 --> 05:42:44,040
Last stream before school starts again for a lot of guys.

3043
05:42:44,040 --> 05:42:45,040
Well, good luck.

3044
05:42:45,040 --> 05:42:50,479
You still get your weekends and just work hard and make sure you get your schoolwork done.

3045
05:42:50,479 --> 05:42:58,360
Did the Ancestors team say how far along the game is for the demo?

3046
05:42:58,360 --> 05:43:00,540
Wait, it's not coming out.

3047
05:43:00,540 --> 05:43:05,599
You don't stream on weekends.

3048
05:43:05,599 --> 05:43:07,860
What's today?

3049
05:43:07,860 --> 05:43:10,479
And what was yesterday?

3050
05:43:10,479 --> 05:43:13,840
Was yesterday Thursday?

3051
05:43:13,840 --> 05:43:15,840
What's what's today?

3052
05:43:15,840 --> 05:43:17,009
Saturday and Sunday.

3053
05:43:17,009 --> 05:43:18,009
Huh?

3054
05:43:18,009 --> 05:43:19,439
What's happening here?

3055
05:43:19,439 --> 05:43:25,840
What is this backpack thing?

3056
05:43:25,840 --> 05:43:27,840
I see this backpack every day.

3057
05:43:27,840 --> 05:43:28,840
So wait, hold on.

3058
05:43:28,840 --> 05:43:34,159
Can somebody clarify this with me?

3059
05:43:34,159 --> 05:43:38,159
Is Ancestors not releasing on Tuesday for PC?

3060
05:43:38,159 --> 05:43:39,159
The one with the apes.

3061
05:43:39,159 --> 05:43:52,169
It's at 2020.

3062
05:43:52,169 --> 05:43:59,720
But that's a console, though, because it comes out a few months after the PC release.

3063
05:43:59,720 --> 05:44:01,720
And I think it's on the Epic Games Store.

3064
05:44:01,720 --> 05:44:02,720
I don't think it's a Steam thing.

3065
05:44:02,720 --> 05:44:03,720
Yeah.

3066
05:44:03,720 --> 05:44:07,400
Yeah, release release date August 27th, 2019.

3067
05:44:07,400 --> 05:44:09,400
It's a demo.

3068
05:44:09,400 --> 05:44:11,029
The Steam page says 2020.

3069
05:44:11,029 --> 05:44:13,029
Well, I think it's because Epic Games Store.

3070
05:44:13,029 --> 05:44:20,220
All right.

3071
05:44:20,220 --> 05:44:25,720
So I'm going to look into that because hopefully it's not just a demo on the 27th.

3072
05:44:25,720 --> 05:44:29,450
Feeling sore or tired?

3073
05:44:29,450 --> 05:44:30,450
Take a break.

3074
05:44:30,450 --> 05:44:31,450
Connect.

3075
05:44:31,450 --> 05:44:33,970
I am.

3076
05:44:33,970 --> 05:44:34,970
So it's a full game.

3077
05:44:34,970 --> 05:44:35,970
That's wet strength.

3078
05:44:35,970 --> 05:44:36,970
That's weird.

3079
05:44:36,970 --> 05:44:42,970
So they're releasing exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC only on the 27th.

3080
05:44:42,970 --> 05:44:46,970
And then a couple of months later, it's going to consoles.

3081
05:44:46,970 --> 05:44:49,970
And then a month or two later, after that, it's going to steam.

3082
05:44:49,970 --> 05:44:51,970
That seems like a very odd release schedule.

3083
05:44:51,970 --> 05:44:56,159
I don't know.

3084
05:44:56,159 --> 05:44:57,159
That's weird.

3085
05:44:57,159 --> 05:45:00,290
But I guess whatever.

3086
05:45:00,290 --> 05:45:06,689
But thank you, everybody, for watching.

3087
05:45:06,689 --> 05:45:08,319
I'm going to go.

3088
05:45:08,319 --> 05:45:09,319
You know what I need to do?

3089
05:45:09,319 --> 05:45:10,319
I need to take a bath.

3090
05:45:10,319 --> 05:45:17,080
I have this part in the middle of my spine right now.

3091
05:45:17,080 --> 05:45:18,080
And you know what I think happened?

3092
05:45:18,080 --> 05:45:20,080
It happened when I did the break dancing move.

3093
05:45:20,080 --> 05:45:24,080
When I did like in the Power Rangers game, I did the break dancing move.

3094
05:45:24,080 --> 05:45:27,569
And like I tweaked my spine.

3095
05:45:27,569 --> 05:45:29,319
I'm doing I'm fine though.

3096
05:45:29,319 --> 05:45:31,319
I just need to soak for like 20 minutes.

3097
05:45:31,319 --> 05:45:36,080
Get some epsom salts.

3098
05:45:36,080 --> 05:45:39,080
Yeah, that's a super old person thing, but I'll do it.

3099
05:45:39,080 --> 05:45:43,029
But let's go back to earlier today.

3100
05:45:43,029 --> 05:45:48,970
Oh, by the way, another important thing for the community nights, the monthly community nights.

3101
05:45:48,970 --> 05:45:59,560
We are I just gave a huge list of things to all the mods about the channel and the discord that's going to open up.

3102
05:45:59,560 --> 05:46:08,439
So probably somewhere around next weekend or maybe maybe even by the time I stream next in like a few days, there's going to be a new channel in the discord.

3103
05:46:08,439 --> 05:46:21,380
In that channel will be kind of like the recommended channel where you put in there a piece of artwork, a song, a video that's related to the channel somehow.

3104
05:46:21,380 --> 05:46:27,380
I have a whole huge thing of rules that eventually will get pinned and posted somewhere in that channel.

3105
05:46:27,380 --> 05:46:37,560
So in once a month, instead of doing this thing at the end of streams where I put on artwork or video that somebody made, because let's face it, I said this last night, but I'll say it again.

3106
05:46:37,560 --> 05:46:40,560
Just because probably a lot of people that weren't here yesterday.

3107
05:46:40,560 --> 05:46:47,049
When the stream ends and this screen goes on, most people will just kind of leave the stream.

3108
05:46:47,049 --> 05:46:54,049
I mean, not most, but it's usually around like 50 to 60 percent will just kind of be like, all right, see, let us see you next time.

3109
05:46:54,049 --> 05:46:59,049
Right. So they don't get to see some of these awesome videos that we show here.

3110
05:46:59,049 --> 05:47:05,939
So I mean, I guess that is most. Yeah, I guess it is.

3111
05:47:05,939 --> 05:47:09,139
And there's been so many great videos.

3112
05:47:09,139 --> 05:47:16,889
Think about the videos. Think about the artwork that has been shown here that a lot of people, maybe they might think it was cool.

3113
05:47:16,889 --> 05:47:29,130
I think it was interesting. So I figured we'll do like a little radio show thing where once a month we sit down for a few hours and we just go over all the cool community content that people make in one place at one time.

3114
05:47:29,130 --> 05:47:34,400
And everybody knows that's what the function is rather than for the bits.

3115
05:47:34,400 --> 05:47:39,700
It's hey, it's the bits. And also, here's a really cool piece of artwork, don't you think?

3116
05:47:39,700 --> 05:47:55,000
I think it's better that way. That's what I think. It should be interesting to do.

3117
05:47:55,000 --> 05:48:01,490
But let's move on. I just want to make sure I clarify that that is coming probably in the next three to five days.

3118
05:48:01,490 --> 05:48:05,799
Keep an eye on the Discord. If you're not part of the Discord, join it.

3119
05:48:05,799 --> 05:48:16,630
It's open to the public. Anybody can be a part of it, but it's not just going to be for artwork.

3120
05:48:16,630 --> 05:48:23,389
It will be for everything. Everything that is related.

3121
05:48:23,389 --> 05:48:36,819
Like one of the things I put in a pin or that I put in the post that I made into the mods was, I mean, if you put like Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off 10 times in a compilation, that is not like a community piece of content.

3122
05:48:36,819 --> 05:48:40,000
It's just Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off like 10 times.

3123
05:48:40,000 --> 05:48:47,299
If it's somehow related to a game or a stream or a thing or a joke or something like that.

3124
05:48:47,299 --> 05:49:02,430
That's very specific. But I'm just saying, I don't want you to link in that Discord like your favorite YouTube video.

3125
05:49:02,430 --> 05:49:07,500
That's not the purpose of these nights. Because it's only going to be probably two or three hours.

3126
05:49:07,500 --> 05:49:15,639
And I want to keep that reserved for like community content.

3127
05:49:15,639 --> 05:49:21,639
I mean, if you edit me into a Gordon Ramsay fucking taste test where he tells me to fuck off, there you go.

3128
05:49:21,639 --> 05:49:25,779
What a narcissist I am. I have to be in it.

3129
05:49:25,779 --> 05:49:38,319
But thank you. Thank you to Chris Buck365 for the four dollars. Thank you. Appreciate it.

3130
05:49:38,319 --> 05:49:47,619
Gnarly thanks to the 250. Have you ever considered representing games you played on a main channel video for a stream? Games like Raven's Cry, Total Distortion, or I Am Alive.

3131
05:49:47,619 --> 05:49:54,970
Maybe as a compilation like these Kinect games would be fun. Total Distortion I think would be really cool.

3132
05:49:54,970 --> 05:49:58,970
Total Distortion is hard to get to run and to capture though.

3133
05:49:58,970 --> 05:50:04,529
All those old games are so difficult because they're barely even DirectX.

3134
05:50:04,529 --> 05:50:10,720
You have to capture a whole monitor. The things in like 480 by fucking 160.

3135
05:50:10,720 --> 05:50:19,680
It's hell to get those to capture through a capture device.

3136
05:50:19,680 --> 05:50:26,650
Oh, there's no music. Sorry.

3137
05:50:26,650 --> 05:50:30,020
They're tiny weird resolutions.

3138
05:50:30,020 --> 05:50:35,020
I think Total Distortion is actually Flash or Adobe Director or something.

3139
05:50:35,020 --> 05:50:38,020
It's not even a 3D engine.

3140
05:50:38,020 --> 05:50:46,189
I've used a virtual machine before, but I'd have to really would set that up.

3141
05:50:46,189 --> 05:50:52,430
I think I've actually used a virtual machine for recording and video streaming purposes.

3142
05:50:52,430 --> 05:51:02,220
I believe I did Windows 95, 98. Just point your webcam at it.

3143
05:51:02,220 --> 05:51:04,220
Yeah, that's I could do that too.

3144
05:51:04,220 --> 05:51:07,220
But yes, I absolutely have thought about it before.

3145
05:51:07,220 --> 05:51:17,180
I mean, Super Mario RPG is going to be done next week.

3146
05:51:20,080 --> 05:51:24,080
$50 came in 10 minutes ago. I was not here for it.

3147
05:51:24,080 --> 05:51:28,080
But thank you Killer Crocomire for the 5,000 bits.

3148
05:51:28,080 --> 05:51:33,479
We all know Sam and Max is coming back, right chat?

3149
05:51:33,479 --> 05:51:42,959
Yeah. Yeah, I played the first episode and then a lot of people started to lose interest.

3150
05:51:42,959 --> 05:51:44,959
I kind of started to lose interest too.

3151
05:51:44,959 --> 05:51:50,959
Something about that third season, the first episode didn't pull me like the first two seasons did.

3152
05:51:50,959 --> 05:51:56,400
I'm still going to finish it because I'm not going to start episode one on the final season and not do it.

3153
05:51:56,400 --> 05:52:01,959
But it didn't pull. It didn't grab me like the other two seasons did.

3154
05:52:01,959 --> 05:52:03,959
Something was something about it. I don't know what it was.

3155
05:52:03,959 --> 05:52:12,490
But thank you Killer Crocomire for the 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.

3156
05:52:12,490 --> 05:52:24,939
You'll see it again. Maybe to maybe next week will just be we'll do Sam and Max Super Mario RPG and we'll connect.

3157
05:52:24,939 --> 05:52:41,240
It makes sense, I think. But yeah, thank you to Elizabeth for the 250.

3158
05:52:41,240 --> 05:52:46,680
In honor of playing Star Wars on stream, I'm bringing back this classic. Is this the Han Solo song?

3159
05:52:46,680 --> 05:52:57,240
Han Solo? I five-starred that on Expert. Were you here for that?

3160
05:52:57,240 --> 05:53:06,900
Jeremy is a Jedi Master? What the hell is this? Why can I not hear it?

3161
05:53:06,900 --> 05:53:08,900
Oh, it's good. This is pulled out.

3162
05:53:08,900 --> 05:53:15,470
This classic? What is it? This classic?

3163
05:53:25,139 --> 05:53:27,139
No, let's see if we can't figure out what you are.

3164
05:53:27,139 --> 05:53:29,139
So that was the Han Solo song.

3165
05:53:29,139 --> 05:53:31,139
And where you come from.

3166
05:53:31,139 --> 05:53:35,529
Oh, it's the hologram video.

3167
05:53:35,529 --> 05:53:40,880
Oh, this is from one of the green screen nights.

3168
05:53:40,880 --> 05:53:51,119
That is a classic. You're right.

3169
05:53:51,119 --> 05:54:04,840
That thumbnail. Yeah, what is it? Shrek?

3170
05:54:04,840 --> 05:54:06,840
What is that thumbnail? What does that have to do with the video?

3171
05:54:06,840 --> 05:54:11,380
I saw it for two seconds.

3172
05:54:11,380 --> 05:54:28,080
Is that the Green Goblin?

3173
05:54:28,080 --> 05:54:30,639
Shrek? I don't know. Who is that?

3174
05:54:30,639 --> 05:54:34,849
Purple underwear?

3175
05:54:34,849 --> 05:54:37,479
Why am I looking at that for so long?

3176
05:54:37,479 --> 05:54:41,909
Alright. It's the Hulk. The Hulk. The Hulk. Okay. You're right. You're right. You're right.

3177
05:54:41,909 --> 05:54:46,520
The Green Goblin.

3178
05:54:46,520 --> 05:54:48,520
Runs around in purple underwear.

3179
05:54:48,520 --> 05:54:53,000
I'm tired. I'm sorry.

3180
05:55:03,709 --> 05:55:05,709
I need to put this on screen.

3181
05:55:05,709 --> 05:55:07,709
This is spot the difference.

3182
05:55:07,709 --> 05:55:11,419
This is from C4G.

3183
05:55:11,419 --> 05:55:16,990
I have to put this on.

3184
05:55:16,990 --> 05:55:18,990
Thank you C4G for the 250.

3185
05:55:18,990 --> 05:55:33,880
Thank you.

3186
05:55:33,880 --> 05:55:36,810
I don't see any difference.

3187
05:55:36,810 --> 05:55:38,810
Thank you Marvash Magali for the 250.

3188
05:55:38,810 --> 05:55:40,810
Half of these Kinect games are just fever dreams.

3189
05:55:40,810 --> 05:55:42,810
Thanks for the super early stream from Italy.

3190
05:55:42,810 --> 05:55:44,810
You're welcome. Absolutely.

3191
05:55:44,810 --> 05:55:51,720
Trying to pull the streams back an hour or two.

3192
05:55:51,720 --> 05:55:53,720
Slowly.

3193
05:55:53,720 --> 05:55:56,029
Over time.

3194
05:55:56,029 --> 05:56:02,240
Trying to stick to that.

3195
05:56:02,240 --> 05:56:04,240
So you'll be seeing earlier streams in the future as well.

3196
05:56:04,240 --> 05:56:08,400
Thank you Elizabeth for the 250.

3197
05:56:08,400 --> 05:56:10,400
I will electrocute you is my favorite quote

3198
05:56:10,400 --> 05:56:13,790
from the Emperor by the way.

3199
05:56:13,790 --> 05:56:15,790
Now we're talking about Ravenous Throat, right?

3200
05:56:15,790 --> 05:56:20,459
Oh yeah.

3201
05:56:20,459 --> 05:56:22,459
I had a lot of shit to say about Star Wars today, didn't I?

3202
05:56:22,459 --> 05:56:28,270
ChunkyBologna gave

3203
05:56:28,270 --> 05:56:30,270
$50 and 20 subs

3204
05:56:30,270 --> 05:56:32,270
earlier. Thank you.

3205
05:56:32,270 --> 05:56:34,639
That is a lot. That's a shitload of money.

3206
05:56:34,639 --> 05:56:38,669
Bitslave also gave

3207
05:56:38,669 --> 05:56:40,669
a ton of subs and

3208
05:56:40,669 --> 05:56:42,669
$50 and 45 cents.

3209
05:56:42,669 --> 05:56:47,599
Thank you.

3210
05:56:47,599 --> 05:56:50,090
And they say, hey German, not sure if you remember me,

3211
05:56:50,090 --> 05:56:52,090
but I used to watch your streams all the time

3212
05:56:52,090 --> 05:56:54,090
and donate like 25 cents all the time.

3213
05:56:54,090 --> 05:56:56,090
I have not a lot of free time to watch your streams

3214
05:56:56,090 --> 05:56:58,090
anymore, but I do keep up with the VODs.

3215
05:56:58,090 --> 05:57:00,090
Thanks for all the great content over the years.

3216
05:57:00,090 --> 05:57:02,090
PSD still have that picture of my dad and I

3217
05:57:02,090 --> 05:57:04,090
on your computer.

3218
05:57:04,090 --> 05:57:06,090
I do not. I do not because I have formatted

3219
05:57:06,090 --> 05:57:08,090
my hard drive since then.

3220
05:57:08,090 --> 05:57:12,189
They're talking about

3221
05:57:12,189 --> 05:57:14,189
this plane, right?

3222
05:57:14,189 --> 05:57:16,189
I do remember this. Yep, it's airplane

3223
05:57:16,189 --> 05:57:18,189
you and dad in front of the airplane.

3224
05:57:18,189 --> 05:57:21,200
I do remember that.

3225
05:57:21,200 --> 05:57:23,200
So yes, I remember you.

3226
05:57:23,200 --> 05:57:29,580
But yeah,

3227
05:57:29,580 --> 05:57:31,580
thanks for coming back.

3228
05:57:31,580 --> 05:57:33,580
I hope you're doing well.

3229
05:57:33,580 --> 05:57:37,680
Thanks for the huge amount of subs

3230
05:57:37,680 --> 05:57:39,680
that you dropped in. Thanks for the $50 and 45

3231
05:57:39,680 --> 05:57:43,520
cents. Appreciate it.

3232
05:57:43,520 --> 05:57:46,650
And then they gave five more dollars. They said five

3233
05:57:46,650 --> 05:57:48,650
dollars more for the next BitBadge.

3234
05:57:48,650 --> 05:57:53,439
There you go. Thank you, Bitslake.

3235
05:57:53,439 --> 05:57:57,080
Welcome back.

3236
05:57:57,080 --> 05:58:02,459
Let's get the credits on.

3237
05:58:02,459 --> 05:58:05,529
Here they come. These are all the subs.

3238
05:58:05,529 --> 05:58:08,029
All the new

3239
05:58:08,029 --> 05:58:10,029
old resubs, community subs, everybody.

3240
05:58:10,029 --> 05:58:13,720
I think they

3241
05:58:13,720 --> 05:58:15,720
should be showing up very shortly.

3242
05:58:15,720 --> 05:58:19,049
There they are. Thank you, all of you

3243
05:58:19,049 --> 05:58:24,939
again. All

3244
05:58:24,939 --> 05:58:26,939
16,500

3245
05:58:26,939 --> 05:58:28,939
of you. Just kidding. I don't have that

3246
05:58:28,939 --> 05:58:32,650
many subs. But man, it feels like it

3247
05:58:32,650 --> 05:58:35,209
sometimes. Thank you guys, for

3248
05:58:35,209 --> 05:58:45,709
real. Really appreciate it.

3249
05:58:45,709 --> 05:58:52,810
Thank you, Master Chicken for the five dollars.

3250
05:58:52,810 --> 05:58:54,810
Probably gonna get tired.

3251
05:58:54,810 --> 05:58:56,810
Probably gonna get fired from work because of my prescription

3252
05:58:56,810 --> 05:58:58,810
medication. Coming home being able to

3253
05:58:58,810 --> 05:59:00,810
watch this stream is making my day more bearable.

3254
05:59:00,810 --> 05:59:04,970
I'm not sure what you

3255
05:59:04,970 --> 05:59:06,970
mean by that, but

3256
05:59:06,970 --> 05:59:08,970
I'm really sorry to hear that. That sucks.

3257
05:59:08,970 --> 05:59:17,680
That's not cool. Hopefully

3258
05:59:17,680 --> 05:59:24,459
you get that sorted out. I'd probably

3259
05:59:24,459 --> 05:59:26,459
figure out if that's, you know,

3260
05:59:26,459 --> 05:59:28,459
you got rights as a worker, you know.

3261
05:59:28,459 --> 05:59:36,270
But hopefully you can figure out

3262
05:59:36,270 --> 05:59:38,270
whatever's going on there. I'm really sorry to hear

3263
05:59:38,270 --> 05:59:44,669
that you're having trouble there. But thanks

3264
05:59:44,669 --> 05:59:46,669
for sticking around here. Thanks for watching.

3265
05:59:46,669 --> 05:59:48,669
Thanks for the five dollars. Appreciate it.

3266
05:59:48,669 --> 05:59:57,180
Yeah, good luck. Best of luck to you.

3267
05:59:57,180 --> 06:00:03,770
Thank you, Bitslay for the five dollars.

3268
06:00:03,770 --> 06:00:07,479
They say, look at this burger I got

3269
06:00:07,479 --> 06:00:09,479
from McDonald's. What are you doing?

3270
06:00:09,479 --> 06:00:11,479
That looks disgusting.

3271
06:00:11,479 --> 06:00:14,619
Why did you

3272
06:00:14,619 --> 06:00:16,619
Why did you do

3273
06:00:16,619 --> 06:00:18,619
Are you watching this in like a Facebook

3274
06:00:18,619 --> 06:00:21,119
browser? This is freaking

3275
06:00:21,119 --> 06:00:25,209
me out. This is freaking me

3276
06:00:25,209 --> 06:00:27,209
out. Why did you give me this?

3277
06:00:27,209 --> 06:00:38,779
Is that a burger?

3278
06:00:38,779 --> 06:00:45,119
Hold on. What the hell is this?

3279
06:00:49,400 --> 06:00:51,400
You got that from McDonald's?

3280
06:00:51,400 --> 06:00:53,400
Why are you giving

3281
06:00:53,400 --> 06:00:56,279
this to me?

3282
06:00:56,279 --> 06:00:58,279
That looks like a

3283
06:00:58,279 --> 06:01:00,279
puppet. It looks like a mouth and a

3284
06:01:00,279 --> 06:01:02,279
mustache. That looks like the Pringles

3285
06:01:02,279 --> 06:01:04,279
guy without his eyes.

3286
06:01:04,279 --> 06:01:06,279
What did you do to the Pringles guy?

3287
06:01:23,880 --> 06:01:25,880
I would

3288
06:01:25,880 --> 06:01:27,880
still eat that too. That actually looks kind of good.

3289
06:01:27,880 --> 06:01:29,880
Except for that weird booger

3290
06:01:29,880 --> 06:01:31,880
that's on the left of it. Whatever that is. Like a piece

3291
06:01:31,880 --> 06:01:34,319
of onion. Well, thank you.

3292
06:01:34,319 --> 06:01:39,950
Thanks for that.

3293
06:01:39,950 --> 06:01:41,950
Wasn't that B on your tier list? No, it wasn't.

3294
06:01:41,950 --> 06:01:44,439
No way.

3295
06:01:44,439 --> 06:01:51,360
McDonald's was on B.

3296
06:01:51,360 --> 06:01:54,560
It was like a C-. But thank you for that.

3297
06:01:54,560 --> 06:01:56,560
Bitslay, appreciate it.

3298
06:01:56,560 --> 06:01:59,689
Thanks for the burger. Silent Serenity, thanks

3299
06:01:59,689 --> 06:02:01,689
for the two fifty. Psychopath Stream

3300
06:02:01,689 --> 06:02:03,689
alters the DNA of his dog

3301
06:02:03,689 --> 06:02:06,700
in his garage. Hello,

3302
06:02:06,700 --> 06:02:09,130
Lizard. But I do get the point.

3303
06:02:09,130 --> 06:02:11,130
Thank you for the two fifty.

3304
06:02:11,130 --> 06:02:14,200
Thank you. Errorless for the two fifty. You should

3305
06:02:14,200 --> 06:02:16,200
dastardly make a Jerma plus two emote

3306
06:02:16,200 --> 06:02:18,200
and only a Jerma plus two emote.

3307
06:02:18,200 --> 06:02:20,200
Not a minus two.

3308
06:02:20,200 --> 06:02:23,900
That's not a bad idea.

3309
06:02:23,900 --> 06:02:28,380
You really game the system there.

3310
06:02:28,380 --> 06:02:30,380
I don't even like Taco Bell thanks to the two dollars and fifty

3311
06:02:30,380 --> 06:02:32,380
cents. Jerma, you look like

3312
06:02:32,380 --> 06:02:34,380
the over enthusiastic instructor at a

3313
06:02:34,380 --> 06:02:36,380
rock climbing summer camp.

3314
06:02:36,380 --> 06:02:50,139
Yeah, okay. Yeah. I'll take

3315
06:02:50,139 --> 06:02:52,139
that one. Thank you. S10W update

3316
06:02:52,139 --> 06:02:54,139
for the two fifty. Hey, Jerma, I want to say I'm happy to support

3317
06:02:54,139 --> 06:02:56,139
you. Unfortunately, I live in Canada

3318
06:02:56,139 --> 06:02:58,139
and I have to pay double for bits.

3319
06:02:58,139 --> 06:03:00,139
Five hundred bits is ten dollars.

3320
06:03:00,139 --> 06:03:02,639
That sounds

3321
06:03:02,639 --> 06:03:04,639
ridiculous. So I can't do this often,

3322
06:03:04,639 --> 06:03:06,639
but I want to let you know that I'll support you no matter what the cost.

3323
06:03:06,639 --> 06:03:08,639
Peace and love. Also congrats on

3324
06:03:08,639 --> 06:03:10,639
being the number one Kinect streamer.

3325
06:03:10,639 --> 06:03:12,639
Happy to hear that this is what you'll be

3326
06:03:12,639 --> 06:03:16,409
known for. I was also

3327
06:03:16,409 --> 06:03:18,409
the number one house flipper streamer, number one

3328
06:03:18,409 --> 06:03:21,229
Labo streamer, number one

3329
06:03:21,229 --> 06:03:23,470
birdhouse streamer. I have

3330
06:03:23,470 --> 06:03:25,470
quite a few accolades, so

3331
06:03:25,470 --> 06:03:37,740
I'll take it.

3332
06:03:37,740 --> 06:03:39,740
Thank you, though, and don't worry about ever paying

3333
06:03:39,740 --> 06:03:41,740
money if you get

3334
06:03:41,740 --> 06:03:43,740
destroyed on

3335
06:03:43,740 --> 06:03:45,740
currency change there.

3336
06:03:45,740 --> 06:03:48,619
You hanging out and watching is

3337
06:03:48,619 --> 06:03:50,619
way more important, so thank you, though.

3338
06:03:50,619 --> 06:03:53,310
I appreciate it.

3339
06:03:53,310 --> 06:03:55,310
Very good.

3340
06:03:55,310 --> 06:03:57,310
Thanks for the, I wasn't supposed to read

3341
06:03:57,310 --> 06:03:59,930
this one. This one's

3342
06:03:59,930 --> 06:04:01,930
not, this one's below the threshold.

3343
06:04:01,930 --> 06:04:03,930
What am I doing reading it?

3344
06:04:03,930 --> 06:04:10,400
They actually say whoever reads this is

3345
06:04:10,400 --> 06:04:16,650
cute. I did.

3346
06:04:16,650 --> 06:04:18,650
It's time for slime thanks to the three dollars. Community nights is

3347
06:04:18,650 --> 06:04:22,299
a nice idea. I'm excited for it.

3348
06:04:22,299 --> 06:04:24,299
It'll be a lot like this, without

3349
06:04:24,299 --> 06:04:26,299
the stream over screen. Probably

3350
06:04:26,299 --> 06:04:28,299
on face cam.

3351
06:04:28,299 --> 06:04:30,919
Hanging out. Just chilling.

3352
06:04:30,919 --> 06:04:38,220
Going over stuff. More

3353
06:04:38,220 --> 06:04:42,700
concentrated. What is it

3354
06:04:42,700 --> 06:04:44,700
gonna be? Uh, the

3355
06:04:44,700 --> 06:04:46,700
channel for

3356
06:04:46,700 --> 06:04:48,700
submissions will be up

3357
06:04:48,700 --> 06:04:50,700
in the discord probably this coming weekend.

3358
06:04:50,700 --> 06:04:52,700
So, like, next weekend. Next, like, Saturday

3359
06:04:52,700 --> 06:04:54,939
or Sunday. And then after that

3360
06:04:54,939 --> 06:04:56,939
probably maybe get a week of the

3361
06:04:56,939 --> 06:04:58,939
submissions. I still also have to talk about the

3362
06:04:58,939 --> 06:05:00,939
activity book stream, which I'm gonna do before I play

3363
06:05:00,939 --> 06:05:05,930
Ancestors on Tuesday.

3364
06:05:05,930 --> 06:05:09,580
That's the plan. We also have

3365
06:05:09,580 --> 06:05:11,580
a 250 from Jay Bong.

3366
06:05:11,580 --> 06:05:13,580
Hey Jay, haven't been able to catch a stream

3367
06:05:13,580 --> 06:05:15,580
in over two months because I was visiting

3368
06:05:15,580 --> 06:05:17,580
family in Vietnam.

3369
06:05:17,580 --> 06:05:19,580
Glad to be back. Also, has Kim ever taught

3370
06:05:19,580 --> 06:05:22,080
you any Vietnamese?

3371
06:05:22,080 --> 06:05:25,599
Welcome back. Thanks for the 250.

3372
06:05:25,599 --> 06:05:27,599
And yes, I have

3373
06:05:27,599 --> 06:05:29,840
been...

3374
06:05:29,840 --> 06:05:31,840
She's tried. I'm a very slow learner.

3375
06:05:31,840 --> 06:05:34,909
I know how to say... I think I'm gonna try.

3376
06:05:34,909 --> 06:05:36,909
I'm gonna say this. I don't know what I'm... I think

3377
06:05:36,909 --> 06:05:38,909
Anca Sao Hong.

3378
06:05:38,909 --> 06:05:40,909
I believe that means I...

3379
06:05:40,909 --> 06:05:43,470
Something Sao Hong

3380
06:05:43,470 --> 06:05:45,470
Anca Sao Hong

3381
06:05:45,470 --> 06:05:51,159
doesn't that mean...

3382
06:05:51,159 --> 06:05:53,159
What's that mean? That means, like, I'm your friend

3383
06:05:53,159 --> 06:05:55,159
or I'm your brother, father?

3384
06:05:55,159 --> 06:05:59,770
What did I just say?

3385
06:05:59,770 --> 06:06:04,060
I am your, like, brother or something.

3386
06:06:04,060 --> 06:06:06,490
Are you okay, dear?

3387
06:06:06,490 --> 06:06:08,490
Right?

3388
06:06:08,490 --> 06:06:10,490
No, I just asked, how are you?

3389
06:06:10,490 --> 06:06:12,490
That's what I said. I said, how are you?

3390
06:06:12,490 --> 06:06:16,909
Like, are you okay? How are you doing?

3391
06:06:16,909 --> 06:06:18,909
I am your

3392
06:06:18,909 --> 06:06:20,909
father. How are you?

3393
06:06:20,909 --> 06:06:22,909
Wow, how wildly different

3394
06:06:22,909 --> 06:06:24,909
that was. At least I said it.

3395
06:06:24,909 --> 06:06:31,950
Are you

3396
06:06:31,950 --> 06:06:33,950
alright? I am your father.

3397
06:06:33,950 --> 06:06:35,950
I played too much Star Wars today.

3398
06:06:35,950 --> 06:06:39,259
That's the problem.

3399
06:06:39,259 --> 06:06:41,880
But, yes,

3400
06:06:41,880 --> 06:06:43,880
we have... She's tried to teach me a few things.

3401
06:06:43,880 --> 06:06:51,500
Thank you

3402
06:06:51,500 --> 06:06:53,930
Dsoid

3403
06:06:53,930 --> 06:06:55,930
KajPDFJA

3404
06:06:55,930 --> 06:06:57,930
Thanks for the four dolls. Thanks for the stream, Jerma.

3405
06:06:57,930 --> 06:06:59,930
Thanks for the four dolls. Thanks for watching.

3406
06:06:59,930 --> 06:07:02,919
You rock.

3407
06:07:02,919 --> 06:07:05,360
Thank you for four dolls. At the very end

3408
06:07:05,360 --> 06:07:07,360
we had 250 from Future

3409
06:07:07,360 --> 06:07:09,599
Gamer. Been watching

3410
06:07:09,599 --> 06:07:11,599
since middle school. Now I'm starting college.

3411
06:07:11,599 --> 06:07:15,310
Any tips for college?

3412
06:07:15,310 --> 06:07:17,310
Good luck at college. Thanks for the 250.

3413
06:07:17,310 --> 06:07:21,020
And yeah, I do.

3414
06:07:21,020 --> 06:07:23,020
If you can... I mean, this is just

3415
06:07:23,020 --> 06:07:25,020
from my personal experience.

3416
06:07:25,020 --> 06:07:27,880
You can take

3417
06:07:27,880 --> 06:07:29,880
day classes or night classes.

3418
06:07:29,880 --> 06:07:32,189
I'm not sure if you signed up for classes already.

3419
06:07:32,189 --> 06:07:35,840
But in the future,

3420
06:07:35,840 --> 06:07:37,840
I always did so much better

3421
06:07:37,840 --> 06:07:39,840
on night classes.

3422
06:07:39,840 --> 06:07:41,840
You had your whole day already

3423
06:07:41,840 --> 06:07:43,840
signed up. Alright, well for the next semester,

3424
06:07:43,840 --> 06:07:45,840
it depends if you're a morning person, that's good.

3425
06:07:45,840 --> 06:07:48,139
But for me, night classes

3426
06:07:48,139 --> 06:07:51,340
gave me the whole day.

3427
06:07:51,340 --> 06:07:53,340
I could sleep in, I wasn't rushing in the morning,

3428
06:07:53,340 --> 06:07:55,340
and I could get up, take a shower, get some food,

3429
06:07:55,340 --> 06:07:57,340
and was able to go to class

3430
06:07:57,340 --> 06:07:59,340
later. That was

3431
06:07:59,340 --> 06:08:01,340
really, really helpful for me.

3432
06:08:01,340 --> 06:08:04,090
But in regards

3433
06:08:04,090 --> 06:08:06,520
to just general advice,

3434
06:08:06,520 --> 06:08:08,700
yeah.

3435
06:08:08,700 --> 06:08:13,310
Take it easy. You don't gotta be the best.

3436
06:08:13,310 --> 06:08:19,049
Do your best.

3437
06:08:19,049 --> 06:08:21,049
Fuck. I just said the same thing opposite.

3438
06:08:21,049 --> 06:08:23,290
Listen.

3439
06:08:26,360 --> 06:08:28,360
Okay. You don't have to

3440
06:08:28,360 --> 06:08:30,669
be the best. Just

3441
06:08:30,669 --> 06:08:32,669
do what you can as

3442
06:08:32,669 --> 06:08:34,840
well as you know how.

3443
06:08:34,840 --> 06:08:40,540
Alright.

3444
06:08:40,540 --> 06:08:42,540
Slam fucking beer

3445
06:08:42,540 --> 06:08:44,540
and scream.

3446
06:08:44,540 --> 06:08:56,959
Don't do that either. You'll do the best

3447
06:08:56,959 --> 06:08:58,959
in college. You know what? You know what I'll

3448
06:08:58,959 --> 06:09:00,959
tell you? The real advice for college, the

3449
06:09:00,959 --> 06:09:02,959
real advice, it's not

3450
06:09:02,959 --> 06:09:05,259
get a 4.0.

3451
06:09:05,259 --> 06:09:07,689
It's try to make some friends.

3452
06:09:07,689 --> 06:09:09,689
Because everybody's starting at the same point.

3453
06:09:09,689 --> 06:09:12,189
And as much as you

3454
06:09:12,189 --> 06:09:14,189
don't think so, everybody else

3455
06:09:14,189 --> 06:09:16,189
is thinking the same thing that you are.

3456
06:09:16,189 --> 06:09:20,599
This is new.

3457
06:09:20,599 --> 06:09:23,040
It's a little nerve wracking.

3458
06:09:23,040 --> 06:09:25,040
And making friends is actually a little bit

3459
06:09:25,040 --> 06:09:27,040
easier in college.

3460
06:09:27,040 --> 06:09:29,040
Because everyone is on that same playing

3461
06:09:29,040 --> 06:09:32,619
field. You also

3462
06:09:32,619 --> 06:09:34,619
start over essentially in college.

3463
06:09:34,619 --> 06:09:38,400
And find people that share the same

3464
06:09:38,400 --> 06:09:40,400
interest as you, and try to

3465
06:09:40,400 --> 06:09:42,400
make some friends. Makes things a lot

3466
06:09:42,400 --> 06:09:44,400
easier, a lot more smooth.

3467
06:09:44,400 --> 06:09:56,430
High school is more clicky, but college is

3468
06:09:56,430 --> 06:09:58,430
easier to find people with similar interests.

3469
06:09:58,430 --> 06:10:00,430
Absolutely, because for the most part, if you're

3470
06:10:00,430 --> 06:10:02,430
in a major, let's say you're majoring

3471
06:10:02,430 --> 06:10:04,430
in, let's say you're majoring

3472
06:10:04,430 --> 06:10:06,430
in engineering or something.

3473
06:10:06,430 --> 06:10:08,430
I'm studying, or communications.

3474
06:10:08,430 --> 06:10:10,430
I'm learning how to do film, tv,

3475
06:10:10,430 --> 06:10:12,430
radio. The people in your

3476
06:10:12,430 --> 06:10:14,430
classes also think that stuff is cool.

3477
06:10:14,430 --> 06:10:17,049
That's why they're there.

3478
06:10:17,049 --> 06:10:19,049
I want to be a business student. I want to be a

3479
06:10:19,049 --> 06:10:21,049
teacher.

3480
06:10:21,049 --> 06:10:23,419
If you want to be a teacher,

3481
06:10:23,419 --> 06:10:25,419
all the people in your classes

3482
06:10:25,419 --> 06:10:27,599
all want to be teachers.

3483
06:10:27,599 --> 06:10:36,299
You have something in common already.

3484
06:10:36,299 --> 06:10:38,299
You went to college 10 years ago, or something.

3485
06:10:38,299 --> 06:10:40,299
Yeah. It's been a very

3486
06:10:40,299 --> 06:10:49,580
long time. Did you learn anything

3487
06:10:49,580 --> 06:10:51,580
from communications related to streaming?

3488
06:10:51,580 --> 06:10:53,580
No. It was not a thing.

3489
06:10:53,580 --> 06:10:55,880
Live, broadcasted

3490
06:10:55,880 --> 06:10:57,880
video from a computer was not

3491
06:10:57,880 --> 06:10:59,880
something that we were doing.

3492
06:10:59,880 --> 06:11:01,880
We were still using tapes.

3493
06:11:01,880 --> 06:11:09,369
But I wish you the best of luck. Just take it

3494
06:11:09,369 --> 06:11:18,330
easy, take it slow,

3495
06:11:18,330 --> 06:11:21,919
and good luck. Everybody's there doing

3496
06:11:21,919 --> 06:11:25,950
the same thing. And with that,

3497
06:11:25,950 --> 06:11:28,959
I will

3498
06:11:28,959 --> 06:11:30,959
see you

3499
06:11:30,959 --> 06:11:33,819
Tuesday.

3500
06:11:33,819 --> 06:11:36,830
For Ancestors,

3501
06:11:36,830 --> 06:11:41,630
the Evolution game.

3502
06:11:41,630 --> 06:11:44,759
See you real soon. Have a wonderful

3503
06:11:44,759 --> 06:11:46,939
rest of your night. See you guys

3504
06:11:46,939 --> 06:11:50,009
Tuesday. Probably going to start Tuesday

3505
06:11:50,009 --> 06:11:52,569
at the normal time. So don't

3506
06:11:52,569 --> 06:11:54,569
plan on a 12 to 1

3507
06:11:54,569 --> 06:11:56,569
PM start. Somewhere around

3508
06:11:56,569 --> 06:11:59,450
3 or 4.

3509
06:11:59,450 --> 06:12:02,520
Goodbye. Take care.

3510
06:12:02,520 --> 06:12:05,790
Good rest of your night.

3511
06:12:05,790 --> 06:12:23,369
Bye. And for those of you that thought that was a little

3512
06:12:23,369 --> 06:12:25,369
too creepy, goodbye.

3513
06:12:25,369 --> 06:12:27,369
Have a great day. See? I

3514
06:12:27,369 --> 06:12:29,369
can do both.
