1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,850
Uh, good evening, or good morning, for some of you.

2
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,940
Ahem.

3
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,979
I was gonna stream tomorrow, the Resident Evil 4 Remake.

4
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,369
But, very big but, I thought the game was coming out tomorrow afternoon.

5
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,340
I was ready and prepared for the game to launch tomorrow at like 1pm Pacific.

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,520
But, it's out right now.

7
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,659
Came out like 30-40 minutes ago. 9pm?

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
That's pretty reasonable.

9
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,359
And I'm very excited.

10
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,959
So let's, let's go quietly, cause it's a little late.

11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,859
Let's go.

12
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,329
Probably gonna be playing this well into the night here.

13
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,180
You're supposed to be asleep?

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
I hope you have a good rest.

15
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,450
It came out five hours ago in Canada.

16
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:30,950
Well, I don't live in Canada.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,390
I live in, uh, people lost me.

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,700
Took a little bit to download. There was no preload.

19
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,670
Which, is a little surprising.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,799
Usually, day before, two days before a game usually have a preload, but it's fine.

21
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,989
Had to start downloading it at exactly 9pm.

22
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,689
But, I'm very excited for this.

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,489
And I'm gonna tell you how excited I am, because this is a different scenario.

24
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,199
Resident Evil 2 Remake, one of my favorite games.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,199
For sure.

26
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,639
Resident Evil 3 Remake, not so much.

27
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:14,740
It was alright.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,699
But, I've heard really great things about this one.

29
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,520
Resident Evil 4 on its own.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,919
The original one is probably one of the best games ever made.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,000
It's definitely, I would say, deserves to be in the top 10, top 25.

32
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:34,240
So, let's do it.

33
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,039
I haven't looked at very much info of this.

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,439
I know there was a demo. I didn't play it.

35
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,939
There's been videos and comparison footage. I haven't seen it.

36
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,639
I've seen maybe one minute of footage of this game.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,159
There's an FOV slider.

38
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,939
So, don't worry.

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,439
I'm not gonna stay, I'm not gonna freak out.

40
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,840
There is an FOV slider in the game.

41
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,139
So, we can relax on that.

42
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,120
I have adjusted it accordingly.

43
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,129
And I don't want to waste any time because other streamers are going faster than me.

44
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:11,830
So, I have to hurry up.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,669
I got the, I got the deluxe version.

46
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,069
I don't know. It said there was like extra stuff and I was like, should I get it?

47
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:21,469
I don't know.

48
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:22,569
I got it.

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,340
Now, the weird, this is gonna get really weird.

50
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,740
And I'm kind of concerned.

51
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,340
I don't know what difficulty to pick because I don't think you can change it.

52
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,770
But anyways, yes, I can confirm.

53
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,469
The lights are off.

54
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,090
Lights are off.

55
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,030
Scary.

56
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,129
This is a scary game.

57
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:56,830
Lights are off.

58
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,939
I'm not playing on the like super difficulty, no way.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,780
All right, so let's go.

60
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,419
Main story, I'm playing keyboard.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Although maybe it's not a good idea.

62
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,490
You can now change character costumes and accessories in these.

63
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,689
Should I like go do that?

64
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,709
You can change the, you can now change the original music slash sound effects.

65
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,560
You guys can't even hear it.

66
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,120
Okay.

67
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:27,920
Extras.

68
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,540
Leon's costume.

69
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,339
Okay.

70
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,839
Of which one of these am I gonna, I feel like this is gonna fuck the whole game up.

71
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,980
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,279
I don't know if I want to do that.

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I feel like it's gonna change everything.

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,120
Won't it change everything?

75
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,689
I'm just gonna go normal for now.

76
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,990
All right, we're gonna go normal.

77
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,360
Accessories.

78
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
How about sunglasses?

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,560
That's like a remake thing to put on, right?

80
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:07,649
Okay.

81
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,019
I'm gonna stay with the defaults.

82
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,449
What is that?

83
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,120
What is the hero filter?

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,019
It's just they took the gamma slider and dragged it all the way over.

85
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,100
Original music?

86
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,529
I don't know.

87
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,930
How should I experience this?

88
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,779
Default A and D.

89
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:35,680
I can change this later.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,279
I'll be all right.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
I can change it later.

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,899
Why are you so nervous?

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I've been looking forward to this game for a long time.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,420
I'm like, I love Resident Evil 4.

95
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,220
And 5.

96
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,889
I'm like, let's go.

97
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,790
I'm so excited.

98
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,560
All right, let's just go.

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,860
We're gonna go with the remake.

100
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,060
I want to be able to give you a real review.

101
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,819
So none of this, we're gonna keep all this off.

102
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:04,610
I'm not nervous.

103
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,810
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,410
Are you guys ready?

105
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,949
Resident Evil 4 remake.

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,540
Okay, this is the problem.

107
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,740
I'm not gonna do this one.

108
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,240
Standard.

109
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,040
For players who have not played Resident Evil 4 in 2005.

110
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,779
Okay, this changes to easy if you die at game over or whatever.

111
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,240
For players who have played Resident Evil 4 in 2000.

112
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,839
I have played Resident Evil 4.

113
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,639
Does that mean I have to pick this difficulty?

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,079
Stronger enemies and harder challenges.

115
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,579
Higher prices for certain items.

116
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,060
How, this is the problem with Resident Evil games though.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,759
How much harder is this than standard?

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,459
Because I can't change this.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
And I don't want to get somewhere and be like, what a fucking disaster.

120
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,439
How much harder is it than standard?

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,860
It's about two and a half times harder.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,319
Moderately.

123
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,110
Don't do it.

124
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:10,579
How would we know?

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
It's too hard.

126
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,019
Find out.

127
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,439
All right.

128
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,139
How about this?

129
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,339
If the game is too, I can't like restart it.

130
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,839
I'm just gonna do standard, right?

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,439
Like what, I don't care.

132
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,569
I don't, I think once you cross, I think once you cross 35 years old,

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,660
I can pay, I can pick this.

134
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:29,860
You know what I mean?

135
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,589
I can pick that.

136
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,160
When you go, when you're over 35, you can pick standard.

137
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,660
That's fine.

138
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
And like, oh, come on.

139
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,160
Like, ah, yeah, that's fine.

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,860
You're over 35.

141
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,459
Yeah, we're good.

142
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:41,829
I'm almost 40.

143
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:42,930
I can pick that one.

144
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,459
The expanded treasure map has been applied.

145
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,660
Okay, what does that even mean?

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,339
You can see the locations of hidden treasures?

147
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,720
All right, everybody quiet.

148
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,769
Blood.

149
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,240
September 30th, 1998.

150
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,889
It's a day I'll never forget.

151
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,899
The cop inside me died that day.

152
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
That night, Raccoon City was wiped out.

153
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,399
Thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella.

154
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:57,779
Somehow I made it out, but too many others weren't so lucky.

155
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,879
This is Resident Evil 2, by the way.

156
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,279
I was asked later to join a top secret government program.

157
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,159
Not that I had a choice.

158
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:09,610
The training.

159
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:11,809
Punishing the missions.

160
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,509
Nearly killed me.

161
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,820
But at least I kept my mind off everything.

162
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,200
If I could just forget what happened that night.

163
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,009
Even for a second.

164
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,059
This time.

165
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,059
It can be different.

166
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,070
It has to.

167
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,169
Okay.

168
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,779
Waiting for this game.

169
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,419
For at least two or three days.

170
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,820
So tell me Yankee.

171
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,340
Why did you come to this horrible place close to nowhere that

172
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,179
I've ever seen?

173
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,769
Let's just say that someone must be very important.

174
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,919
The chief gave the orders himself.

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,820
Help him.

176
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,019
Not very sunny right now.

177
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,419
I'm sure your boys didn't come all the way out here to roast

178
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,120
marshmallows.

179
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,669
You have a strange sense of humor.

180
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,429
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

181
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,230
Just between us.

182
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,029
It's quiet.

183
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,529
Seems like it's kind of loud.

184
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,789
And it's been that way for a while now.

185
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,320
Should be just another day in the office, right?

186
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,220
Gonna get loud just to give you a warning.

187
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I mean last week there was a search for some missing hikers.

188
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,919
I'm sure you'll do your best to help me.

189
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,620
It's like Duke Nukem Netflix adaptation is because the glasses

190
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,779
because the glasses that's what you're saying.

191
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,679
Nature calls him.

192
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,450
I'll be right back.

193
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,570
That was pretty good first look.

194
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,970
So that's it.

195
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,870
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

196
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,570
We'll pick it up right where we left off.

197
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:42,970
I think.

198
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,870
Just want to get a good feel for the very beginning and see

199
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,470
how it was.

200
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,860
The opening cutscene to me is very important.

201
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,659
I need to kind of digest it for a day or two.

202
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,860
I'd say maybe three or four days.

203
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,360
I need to kind of relax on the couch for a little while and

204
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
kind of process everything.

205
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,360
So and about yeah, it's going to be probably a few days.

206
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,840
He sure is taking his time.

207
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,399
Did he fall in?

208
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,259
Maybe you better go and take a look.

209
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,419
I want to take the glasses off.

210
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:23,820
It's ruining my remake.

211
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,779
It's ruining my immersion in the remake.

212
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,850
So much for helping me.

213
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,809
Here we go.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,299
It looks pretty good.

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,600
How does it run though?

216
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,220
Hold on.

217
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,179
How does it run?

218
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,539
That seems it seems pretty clean actually.

219
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,250
I'm so glad I could turn the FOV up as well.

220
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,289
It seems pretty clean.

221
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,360
Wait, there's a jump scare right now isn't there?

222
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,860
Yeah, there is just to give a quick warning for everybody.

223
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,259
Birds fly down and scare you in like five seconds.

224
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,159
From what I remember.

225
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,860
How far could you have gone?

226
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,590
In three, two, one, cue the birds.

227
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,850
Cue the, the birds are coming soon.

228
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,419
I need to change that.

229
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:53,230
Sorry.

230
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,929
Give me one second.

231
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,889
E and F always need to be flipped for me.

232
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,980
I don't I don't know what happened in the last five years

233
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,960
of gaming but F replaced E for some reason and I've been

234
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,259
trying to figure out why for a long time.

235
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,700
F replaced E and it was always E and I think it's because

236
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
E started to become lean.

237
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,730
I wanted E.

238
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:17,669
Sorry.

239
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:26,860
Knife and parry.

240
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,259
That's fine.

241
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:27,659
Space.

242
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,559
Pick up item.

243
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,460
Examine F.

244
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,259
No, it's E.

245
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,120
And melee is mouse button.

246
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,059
Reload.

247
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:35,960
That's fine being R.

248
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,980
Isn't already knife.

249
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,379
Okay.

250
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,340
Attach remove mines.

251
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
G is fine.

252
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,340
Move backwards.

253
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,889
Move camera.

254
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,389
Run and shift.

255
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,090
That's fine.

256
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,590
Crouch stand evade is C.

257
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,909
Come on.

258
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,009
What year is it?

259
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,590
How can we change these things?

260
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,590
Even staples for years.

261
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,679
Or control, right?

262
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,279
What is control in the game?

263
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,379
Command Ashley.

264
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:02,879
Oh, okay.

265
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:04,309
C.

266
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,179
All right, we're good.

267
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,059
Unable to apply some changes.

268
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:14,879
Wait, what?

269
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,009
What was wrong?

270
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,379
I don't know.

271
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:21,980
Make this like...

272
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,059
No, stop.

273
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:24,960
I don't know.

274
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,259
Make this like Y.

275
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:28,629
We're good.

276
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:29,970
Cut it out.

277
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:33,919
E.

278
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,620
There it is.

279
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,919
And then melee.

280
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,320
There we go.

281
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,620
We're good.

282
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh, no, that wasn't it.

283
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,240
Wasn't that it?

284
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,899
That was fucking pretty scary.

285
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,480
I remember this house.

286
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,460
I wonder how much of this I truly remember because it's

287
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,460
It's actually been a really long time.

288
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,759
The last time I actually played for Resident Evil 4.

289
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,340
I mean, it has to be

290
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,200
10 years.

291
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,700
Has to be 10 years.

292
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Maybe a little less.

293
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,220
Maybe I don't know.

294
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,019
Maybe a little more.

295
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,049
It looks great though.

296
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm so glad I avoided all the footage.

297
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,419
Anyone home?

298
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,929
Might be a little too loud.

299
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:36,299
But it's okay.

300
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,000
We'll figure that out.

301
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,110
What's that?

302
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,480
Should I pretend like I've never played this before?

303
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,329
That's probably a good idea, right?

304
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,660
Just like pretend like I've never played this.

305
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,019
Isn't that that the YouTube video will be so much better?

306
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,920
And I'll get so many more engagements.

307
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,059
This place looks so much different now.

308
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,079
It's crazy.

309
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,519
This feels like a different game.

310
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:52,819
Even though I know it's not.

311
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,269
Sorry to barge in like this.

312
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,599
Say it.

313
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,940
Do it.

314
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,190
We're all waiting for it.

315
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,319
We're all waiting for it.

316
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:31,809
That's loud.

317
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,210
Sorry, I'll fix it.

318
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.

319
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,099
Important.

320
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:54,799
I know people...

321
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,299
I know I'm breaking your immersion and breaking my immersion,

322
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,099
but we got to get this right.

323
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,000
I am a toggle

324
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,579
aim down sights person.

325
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,160
Now,

326
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,759
I don't...

327
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,359
I know that

328
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
offends a lot of people probably,

329
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,859
but I don't care.

330
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,660
Is it in the game?

331
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,880
Cursor lock.

332
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:13,920
Control...

333
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,319
No.

334
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,589
Auto reload.

335
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,089
I actually don't like that very much.

336
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:18,890
I don't like that either.

337
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,289
I don't like that either.

338
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,859
But I'm going to do it.

339
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,430
Aim assist off.

340
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,740
Where would it be?

341
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,170
Where would it be?

342
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,089
But aim assist is off.

343
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,440
You're literally a psycho.

344
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:36,940
What?

345
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,029
Is there a toggle aim down sights?

346
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,380
It's in the camera settings.

347
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,779
Okay.

348
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,140
Oh, right here.

349
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,740
Hold on a minute.

350
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,500
When aiming,

351
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,069
this is camera inversion.

352
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,049
Field of view.

353
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,700
Where is it?

354
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:06,930
Is it here?

355
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:10,450
Field of view.

356
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:11,849
Camera sensitivity.

357
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,049
Camera inversion.

358
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,349
Camera acceleration.

359
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,049
Camera speed.

360
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,920
Does anyone know where it is?

361
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,250
Then controls.

362
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,750
Accessibility maybe?

363
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,309
Control type.

364
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,589
Quick turn type.

365
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:36,490
Crouch.

366
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,690
Type is toggle.

367
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,799
Repeated input.

368
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,970
Oh, you got a toggle for crouch, but no toggle for...

369
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:45,670
Really?

370
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:46,369
Oh, come on.

371
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,900
Play.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
I, I, this is how I like to play.

373
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,200
Is it actually not in the game?

374
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
Two to the right.

375
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,630
Down three in camera.

376
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,180
Aim.

377
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,779
Wait.

378
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,559
Whatever.

379
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,440
I'll deal with it.

380
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,400
That's all right.

381
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,410
This sensitivity has to come way up, but...

382
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:44,809
And I'm going to fix it.

383
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:45,910
You do your settings.

384
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,609
You do your settings.

385
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,609
I couldn't get in here and do this before because the preload,

386
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,509
there's no preload.

387
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,509
And there, just wait.

388
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:54,700
Sensitivity.

389
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,950
Is it camera speed?

390
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,119
These, these settings are kind of confusing.

391
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:11,849
That's better.

392
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,420
All right.

393
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,880
I might fix it later, but we're going to see.

394
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,700
Man, that stinks.

395
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,500
Those were controller settings.

396
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,700
Turn up the FOV.

397
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,099
FOV is at the highest it can go.

398
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,230
I think it's a good spot.

399
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:38,660
All right.

400
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,460
HUD looks good.

401
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,759
Yeah.

402
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:42,160
Okay.

403
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:42,559
Let's go.

404
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:54,660
Leon's jacket would be way too big for you.

405
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
So order me a small.

406
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,279
Of what?

407
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,779
I, you can't, oh, you can't get me a small police jacket?

408
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,980
What are you talking about?

409
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,480
Why, why would I put on somebody else's jacket?

410
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,119
Creepy.

411
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,119
Not extra small.

412
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,119
I'm a men's small to medium.

413
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,759
Don't change that.

414
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,700
This game is fucked up.

415
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,960
There's no way you're a small.

416
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,279
I'm a, I am a, I'm a men's small.

417
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:45,279
It depends.

418
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:57,359
Hey, here it comes.

419
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,559
I read you.

420
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,960
Let me sip my tea before we get into this.

421
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,759
What's your situation?

422
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,450
Take the glasses off.

423
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,750
I, not yet.

424
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,349
I'll leave them for one more cut scene.

425
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,880
This is way scarier.

426
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,380
This is way scarier.

427
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:45,059
Ah, see before I could kind of, I could hide behind the

428
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,759
fact that it was the graphics weren't, I mean, the graphics

429
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,859
were good at the time.

430
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,660
But if you go back and play the old resume before it's

431
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,359
like, oh, okay.

432
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,789
Like this current gen graphics makes this way scarier.

433
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:18,829
I don't know why it just does quiet.

434
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,319
I'm so glad I didn't play on the fucking hardcore.

435
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,519
I'm so glad I didn't play on hardcore.

436
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:32,990
Wait, how do I do it?

437
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,029
Oh, it's a, it's mouse button.

438
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,670
It's mouse button.

439
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,769
It's a mouse button to do the melee execute, right?

440
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,750
So glad I'm not playing on a fucking hardcore.

441
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,990
When you're 35 and older, you can pick this.

442
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,809
Once you drop out of that, okay, any bracket that says,

443
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:53,809
Hey, how old are you?

444
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,710
What is your, what age are you in?

445
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,210
You know, it's usually 18 to 34, right?

446
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,809
The second that you go over 35 plus, like when you go to

447
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,109
the next bracket, just pick the regular difficulties.

448
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,839
There's no reason to.

449
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,140
Was there anything else in here that I needed?

450
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,539
You've changed.

451
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,789
Yeah, I fucking aged.

452
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,490
You are correct.

453
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:23,990
You are.

454
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,589
You are absolutely correct.

455
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,289
I have changed to very, I have changed a lot in the last

456
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,089
10 to 20 plus years.

457
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,309
I'm a little older now.

458
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,430
Hey, you kids don't even know.

459
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,049
Don't you have to pull bookcases and stuff?

460
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,359
Are you, I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but

461
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,880
I'm trying to remember how this plays out.

462
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:54,920
How many bullets left?

463
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,519
Take the glasses off.

464
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,140
Bruce, this is Gondor one.

465
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,940
Hunnigan here.

466
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,740
What's your sit rep?

467
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,009
President's daughter, baby Eagle.

468
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,210
It's likely she's in this village.

469
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,029
Our Intel was correct then.

470
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:30,829
Well done.

471
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:33,390
Need a location on a nearby lake.

472
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,589
We'll do comedy mode later.

473
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,190
Copy that.

474
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:37,789
I'll see what I can find.

475
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,180
Something's happened to people here.

476
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:43,329
My escorts are.

477
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,119
The audio is so much.

478
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,819
They spent a lot of time on the audio.

479
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,619
I don't have any bullets.

480
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Did I pick hardcore?

481
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,619
I wanted to look directly into the camera and go.

482
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,119
Wouldn't put a stair though.

483
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,309
Boom, big music cue.

484
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:17,910
You know what I mean?

485
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,349
Just how we know what game we're playing.

486
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,839
Glasses off.

487
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
No, the glass is staying on.

488
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,819
For at least 10 to 20 more minutes.

489
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:56,769
That crow.

490
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,440
Raven was as big as a dog.

491
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:04,569
I think.

492
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:05,369
Yeah, it's E.

493
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,480
Yep.

494
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,579
Handgun ammo.

495
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,079
Good.

496
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,279
Gonna need a lot of that.

497
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,380
What do I want to upgrade though?

498
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,980
That's the thing.

499
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,279
I always pick something different.

500
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:27,759
Okay, save it.

501
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,319
And attach it.

502
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,920
Case has been added to the customized case menu.

503
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Charm has been added to the customized case menu.

504
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,599
Deluxe weapon has been added to the menu.

505
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,119
Okay.

506
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:48,819
This is cheating.

507
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:50,420
Is this isn't this?

508
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:52,220
I have two free weapons.

509
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,019
This is cheating.

510
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,119
I got the deluxe edition.

511
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,619
I'm a big fan.

512
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,019
I got the deluxe edition.

513
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:01,400
So what we don't have to use it.

514
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,500
I just I'm a big fan.

515
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
So I got the deluxe edition.

516
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,240
I won't use it.

517
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:21,119
We need to stay true to the original and I'm going to be

518
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,319
I'm going to have a gold case because that's I think that's kind of cool.

519
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:25,970
Increased drop rate.

520
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,269
Wait, this is cheating.

521
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:38,349
Increased drop rate for gunpowder increased drop rate.

522
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,640
Wait, wait, this is the actual case does this too.

523
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,359
Is this new?

524
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:50,769
I don't remember this.

525
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,670
Well those bonuses in the regular game.

526
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:58,059
I would I'd rather the handgun ammo.

527
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,410
Okay, very good.

528
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,640
Continue.

529
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:21,859
Ooh, very nice.

530
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,240
This is the village part, isn't it?

531
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:27,839
All right.

532
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:44,380
This is the first real test that handgun ammo.

533
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,799
Thank you.

534
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,369
Do I even have the knife yet?

535
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:05,339
I don't think I do.

536
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,619
That's money.

537
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,509
Whoo.

538
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,019
All right.

539
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,720
So that's how you do the execute.

540
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,119
Okay.

541
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:37,759
All right.

542
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,759
That's how you do the execute.

543
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,440
So you're going to knock him down then go over and stab them on the ground.

544
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,000
Very cool.

545
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,180
These people were friendly.

546
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:03,400
I forgot these existed.

547
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,200
I forgot.

548
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,799
I think it's been 10 years since I played this.

549
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:15,349
Oh my god.

550
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,119
Somebody there are herbs in this game.

551
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,319
You got to combine them, right?

552
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
Or did they streamline that somehow?

553
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,700
Flash grenade.

554
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,269
Change weapon.

555
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:44,869
Okay.

556
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:45,170
Yep.

557
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,569
Cool.

558
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,839
I'm going to save all those to the end of the game and throw them all

559
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,839
at the t-virus whatever it is.

560
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:57,309
So I'm going to make sure I probably will have like 30 or 40 flashbangs

561
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,619
at the end of the game.

562
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,390
Which is fine.

563
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,480
Looks great.

564
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:27,369
Cool.

565
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm coming.

566
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,730
Why not?

567
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,139
Oh my god.

568
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,139
That's the worst place for that to be on my thumb button.

569
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,130
Oh fuck.

570
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,219
You're doing it hard to suppress this.

571
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:57,750
Shit.

572
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,349
I suck.

573
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,820
What's quick turn?

574
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,420
What's quick turn?

575
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,820
It's Q.

576
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:20,949
Ow.

577
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:29,860
Yep.

578
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,260
Yep.

579
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,630
You're fucked bro.

580
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,429
No, I'm fine.

581
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:42,630
I'm fine.

582
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:42,929
I'm fine.

583
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,460
This is so much scarier than the other one.

584
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,659
It feels like two.

585
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,260
It feels like more real somehow.

586
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,460
I don't know why it just does.

587
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,070
Oh shit.

588
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,360
Oh my god.

589
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:28,159
This is not one of these guys in the original.

590
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,679
Wait, was there?

591
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,860
Oh shit.

592
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:49,940
Whoa.

593
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,900
Get out of my way.

594
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,199
Get out of my way.

595
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,000
Get out of my way.

596
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,099
I should have picked the system.

597
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,400
I should have picked the system.

598
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,000
I should have picked the system.

599
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,300
That was my fault.

600
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,199
That was my fault.

601
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,260
Oh my god.

602
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
That's so much worse.

603
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,110
I need ammo.

604
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,639
Get the fuck out of my way.

605
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,699
Oh shit.

606
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,420
I have to change this key vine.

607
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:51,340
Oh, oh.

608
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,860
How do I do it?

609
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,360
Five.

610
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,059
Press five.

611
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:54,760
Press five.

612
00:38:55,659 --> 00:39:00,769
How do I do it?

613
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,070
How do I do it?

614
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:05,070
Why can't I throw the grenade?

615
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,170
How do I do it?

616
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,429
Oh fuck all of you in there.

617
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:15,469
Give me that.

618
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:15,769
Give me that.

619
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:16,570
I need that money.

620
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,019
Oh shit.

621
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,460
What?

622
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,829
Get away from me.

623
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,179
Ow.

624
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,829
Ow.

625
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,269
I need more healing.

626
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,670
How do I win?

627
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,670
Don't you?

628
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:38,860
There it is.

629
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,260
Okay.

630
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,059
I was saying what the fuck?

631
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,449
I was like you got to just live man.

632
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,659
I was going to say.

633
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,760
I feel like that took longer.

634
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,460
That was so terrifying.

635
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,960
It's so much worse now.

636
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,019
I got to collect all those items.

637
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:51,869
Jeez.

638
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Where's everyone going?

639
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:00,639
Bingo.

640
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,599
That was awesome.

641
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,400
That was actually really cool.

642
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,969
I very very vividly remember this part, but

643
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,369
wow, that was

644
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
that was something else.

645
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,179
All right.

646
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,880
So the issue it's you have to get to here and then press five.

647
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,659
It's not you don't just press five.

648
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,260
Wait, I can just press five.

649
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,760
Why wasn't this?

650
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:35,239
That wasn't working before kind of panicking.

651
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,909
All right.

652
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,210
Let me explore first.

653
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,340
I'm not doing good.

654
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,659
Copy that.

655
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:51,739
I look like shit.

656
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:00,730
Okay, good.

657
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,099
Map.

658
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,090
You could become lost.

659
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,489
You can check your map position and objectives on the map.

660
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:08,789
You have a treasure map.

661
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:11,090
You'll be able to see the locations of hidden valuables.

662
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,280
That's cool.

663
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:18,940
I love these games.

664
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,099
No, don't throw that.

665
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:28,960
Reload the gun.

666
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:37,579
Ah, you take some ibuprofen or something the shotgun.

667
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Oh, nice.

668
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,099
Nice.

669
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,179
Even if I take ibuprofen, it's gonna take like 45 minutes for it to

670
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:49,579
kick in.

671
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,860
Okay, I actually I am going to heal.

672
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,559
Item crafting certain materials such as resources, gunpowder and knives

673
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,659
can be used to craft different items.

674
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:11,400
The types of items that you can craft can be increased by obtaining

675
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,599
new crafting recipes.

676
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,239
This wasn't in the old one, was it?

677
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,309
Maybe it was handgun and was it?

678
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,309
What is that a burrito?

679
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,340
What is that thing?

680
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,730
I know just wait till you can do complete herbs.

681
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,030
I don't know.

682
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:40,530
I doesn't matter.

683
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:40,929
I don't care.

684
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,510
I should probably put I'm just gonna do this.

685
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,010
Whatever.

686
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,150
I should assign this.

687
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:54,550
Oh, you can't.

688
00:43:58,059 --> 00:43:58,360
Cool.

689
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,460
I'm gonna explore a little bit.

690
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,659
I don't want to forget anything.

691
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,760
I don't want to leave anything and I know because everyone this is

692
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,360
a beloved video game and everybody's played probably five times

693
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,260
each all of us.

694
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:11,059
I'm gonna miss a treasure and it's gonna be spam in my chat people

695
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,460
screaming at me because I missed it.

696
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,260
So I'm gonna do my best.

697
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:20,789
Very good.

698
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,639
I know that there's they put the treasure on the map now.

699
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
So there's one in here.

700
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:33,960
I had never played this before.

701
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm not 37.

702
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:37,750
That's true for some of you.

703
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,409
Maybe this is hurt.

704
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,030
No, I'm good.

705
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:44,440
All right.

706
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,800
So the treasures in here covered maybe.

707
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,480
No, how's the audio and visual?

708
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,980
Is it brightness?

709
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:58,409
You're blocking your health and ammo with your face cam.

710
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,050
Oh, that's gonna be fixed.

711
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:04,570
Is that better?

712
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:08,530
That's better, right?

713
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:13,369
It's a little too dark because I thought it was a little too dark

714
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:14,869
when I was doing the initial setup.

715
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:19,969
So I'm probably gonna turn it up a little bit if I do that.

716
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,820
Good luck finding that.

717
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,329
I don't have super resolution on my way.

718
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:37,230
I was there.

719
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:37,829
I missed it.

720
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,530
Okay.

721
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,670
Yeah, I see we'll go like we'll go up to the middle.

722
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:43,969
I think that's looks good.

723
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,559
The better it was a little better.

724
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,760
I don't have a key for this.

725
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:51,119
All right.

726
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,320
There's one more over here, but it's a locked door so I can't

727
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,820
get in up that it shows everything on the map.

728
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,219
Now that's actually incredibly useful.

729
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:03,739
All right.

730
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,940
Where did I throw that grenade?

731
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,239
Because I want to go in that room.

732
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,000
Who's in here?

733
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:20,440
These people are sick.

734
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:25,639
All right.

735
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:27,539
So this is where I threw the grenade in here and there was a

736
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:28,539
bunch of shit on the ground.

737
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:31,460
Okay, nice.

738
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,119
Oh, think of that's everything.

739
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:37,519
Now.

740
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,019
I'm not going to get everything.

741
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,320
I'm not going to get everything people might expect.

742
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,619
Why do you not going to get everything?

743
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:43,719
I'm not going to get everything.

744
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,159
One more spot to look is in here.

745
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,159
I can I go in here yet?

746
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,780
I cannot.

747
00:46:59,179 --> 00:46:59,980
This is a little bit later.

748
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,739
Get everything.

749
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
I'm not going to get everything.

750
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,639
I know.

751
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,659
No, I'm going to go up here and look.

752
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:14,769
Can you please not stream till 3 a.m.

753
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:15,170
Again?

754
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:16,969
Oh, I can't promise you anything.

755
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:18,489
All right.

756
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:21,170
So over here, there's a treasure.

757
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,170
My whole body hurts.

758
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:28,070
Everything hurts.

759
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,170
I just like had a heart attack in one second.

760
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:32,469
That's I don't remember that happening.

761
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:35,940
Ooh.

762
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,239
Yep.

763
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,039
You get gems.

764
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:41,639
You combine them.

765
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:42,539
So the worth way more.

766
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:47,940
All right.

767
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,840
I think we've got everything we needed from here.

768
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,500
It's time to continue the playthrough.

769
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,119
Bloody Vamo like did everything.

770
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,619
Now we have to go back this way.

771
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,019
Right?

772
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:06,130
I don't remember this.

773
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:06,730
I don't remember that.

774
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,329
I don't remember that.

775
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:07,829
I don't remember this.

776
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:08,530
I don't remember that.

777
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,769
Did I get everything in here Ruby?

778
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,070
That wasn't even on the map and I got it.

779
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,280
Please don't spend all the treasure you get on that family

780
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,179
guy mobile game app.

781
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
I can't promise that either.

782
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,260
I drank all my tea already.

783
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
Must be a stressful game.

784
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,219
All the tea is gone.

785
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,570
I'm going to get a refill already.

786
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:51,739
There it is.

787
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:06,849
I got to be way more conservative with shooting our resources.

788
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,150
There we go.

789
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,570
Now I can make some bullets if I want to go.

790
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,550
It says standard, but I might be a bug in the game because

791
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,250
I picked hardcore before starting.

792
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,480
So the game is hardcore.

793
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,480
I think it's on hardcore, but just kind of says it isn't

794
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:27,849
as I think it's a known bug.

795
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,679
So how much better is this than the other shotgun?

796
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,329
Can I look at the damage on it?

797
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:42,469
Who cares?

798
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:43,570
I'm going to use it.

799
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:43,969
Fuck it.

800
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:44,469
Why not?

801
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,159
That's my hand good made for Leon.

802
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:52,719
Sentinel nine.

803
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:57,639
It's cluttered now.

804
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,440
I'll fix it.

805
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:05,579
This is going to turn into the lawnmower bag when you're done

806
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:06,480
at the end of the day.

807
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,219
This is kind of just a cut a bunch of cut grass in here.

808
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,039
I'm a cheater.

809
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:12,440
It's fine.

810
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,380
That's fine.

811
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,400
I'm going to put this on here.

812
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,400
Okay.

813
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,320
Hey, I'm not going to combine any of this.

814
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,409
Yeah, this is fine.

815
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,719
I'm going to put this over on.

816
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:41,880
Yeah, there we go.

817
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,380
Okay.

818
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:47,440
This is a good bit.

819
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:50,969
What's the bit?

820
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:57,039
I mean, this is I got I got this because I paid an extra $10

821
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:57,639
for the game.

822
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:05,039
It's going to be cluttered.

823
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:05,840
Ah shit.

824
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,239
You're right.

825
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:06,940
No, whatever.

826
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,440
I don't care.

827
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,940
Not in the very beginning of the game like this.

828
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,639
It's going to be fine.

829
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,460
Let's just test it and see how it is.

830
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,170
If I don't if I like it.

831
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:15,570
I like it.

832
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,219
Give me that.

833
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,320
There's a jewel right here.

834
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:47,289
Oops.

835
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:00,789
Oh eggs.

836
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:13,500
Thanks for the oh, the deluxe gun is pretty good.

837
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,579
There's a bacon lettuce and tomato on this one.

838
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,550
Blue request notes.

839
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,650
You can take on tasks by collecting the blue request

840
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,570
notes posted around the areas and destroy.

841
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,309
Okay, destroy all the blue medallions.

842
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:46,309
I've only got three more.

843
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,590
So it's a good question.

844
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:02,869
Good.

845
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,320
I mean, this ain't a speedrun.

846
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,519
So hold on.

847
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:11,480
This ain't a speedrun.

848
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,940
Hurry up.

849
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,440
Hurry up.

850
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:22,440
This ain't a speedrun.

851
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,239
I want to check all this out.

852
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:28,940
I'm not trying to go as fast as I can.

853
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:46,780
It even all right.

854
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,280
It shows where they are.

855
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:50,880
That's useful.

856
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,179
I guess you don't have to really look for

857
00:53:52,179 --> 00:54:03,289
them is just because it's a deluxe treasure map.

858
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:04,389
You have the cheater map.

859
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:05,590
It's because you paid for it.

860
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:07,349
Really?

861
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,650
Is that for real?

862
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:13,570
I have the cheater map.

863
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,239
Are you serious?

864
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:18,539
That's actually whatever.

865
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:23,269
I have the cheater map.

866
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:27,619
Oh, I do.

867
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:35,000
Hey, when you get to be 35 and older.

868
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,650
Sorry, you can get the cheater map.

869
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:38,949
Sorry.

870
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,079
So then that where's this one then?

871
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,019
Up here.

872
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:48,639
Right there.

873
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:49,440
So what do I get?

874
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,280
Hey, I got it.

875
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,119
Challenge complete.

876
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:05,809
I want that.

877
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,010
Where is this lady?

878
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,800
Where is this lady?

879
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,360
I don't know.

880
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:25,510
Let's go.

881
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:38,630
I see it.

882
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,030
Okay.

883
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,730
I know it's pretending that I couldn't see it.

884
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,610
Remember the cheater map just turned this from a 30-hour

885
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,809
playthrough to a 130-hour playthrough.

886
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,130
Kind of true because I'm going to be like, oh look, this

887
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,530
one other go that way and go get that.

888
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:18,820
I need to look at the map a lot though.

889
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,420
I'm a map user.

890
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:38,800
Oh, somebody bought the deluxe edition.

891
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:40,170
Sorry.

892
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,409
Let me see the other deluxe edition.

893
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:03,250
Oh, you get a gear.

894
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:05,869
I got to fix everything myself.

895
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:06,469
Mm-hmm.

896
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:26,289
Anything else I missed in here?

897
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:39,730
That is what what does that drop down?

898
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,619
Is that what that's what the chest is, isn't it?

899
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Ask the cheater map.

900
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,139
Maybe it'll know.

901
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:54,690
Oh, interesting.

902
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:55,489
Yeah, down here.

903
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:57,389
Yeah, no, I knew where this was.

904
00:57:57,389 --> 00:57:57,989
I looked at it.

905
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,199
Get the barrels.

906
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:02,469
I will.

907
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,300
Ooh, nice.

908
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:08,489
I didn't look at the cheater map for this.

909
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:09,190
I saw it through the door.

910
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,480
What the fuck was that?

911
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,539
It's a knife.

912
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:40,139
There's the dog.

913
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,489
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

914
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:45,469
Damn.

915
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:53,139
Get out of here.

916
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:07,570
Come on.

917
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,170
Come on up.

918
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:22,269
Get out.

919
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:23,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

920
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

921
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:30,769
Oh shit.

922

973
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:54,930
all of it because when you do all three it increases your max health right yes very important

974
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:01,310
if you do all three i'm like you guys even see me i'm so dark i like yeah the room can you guys

975
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:20,529
even see when you can see me all right that should free up some space you know just is this this is

976
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:27,569
storage right or is this me throwing it on the ground no i know okay i see i see let me get this

977
01:16:27,569 --> 01:17:00,479
right inventory management time this thing is broken so i i know that like people like to say

978
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,920
that however your inventory management is in resident evil games is like you're taking a

979
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,119
meyers briggs personality test so i don't know how well you guys can decipher from this but this is

980
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:49,020
how i do it auto sort why would i i don't know i want to do it i like it much cleaner looking

981
01:17:50,449 --> 01:18:07,069
much cleaner all right we're good now auto sorted and ruin it so what do i get for personality

982
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:27,329
what do you think somebody said this is an average tick talker awful normie normie will bring

983
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:52,510
everything is that true yeah yeah yeah exactly all right don't die this is where i lost before

984
01:18:53,069 --> 01:19:17,260
can i get around there because somebody died up there yes i can good good very good i got a lot

985
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:23,869
of money all right let's take a look at the cheating menu take something cool over there

986
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:52,909
that's not hurting me anything back here no got everything it looks really really good i don't

987
01:19:52,909 --> 01:20:18,560
even have every setting turned on either it looks oh i get those glasses off hero filter i imagine

988
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:29,920
playing with that on the whole game what about the villain filter i just feel like i have low

989
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:41,539
health that's a nice it's all right but i'm i don't think i'm gonna turn that on

990
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:58,460
i gotta use q more often the quick turn just saves your life so many times i love the parry

991
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,060
the path all right now i'm understanding we're hardcore could have been all right

992
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:20,539
the parry is a very interesting just addition anything else i can't open this shoot the water

993
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:45,470
shoot the water shoot the water shoot the water wait shoot the water why lol lol lol why do i have

994
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:58,159
all right hold on a second no i i think don't isn't that no no no no no no no no i know i know

995
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:03,619
and i'm not starting this fucking whole section over again i know what happens i'm not starting

01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:07,649
the whole section over you can pet pet laugh all you want i'm not gonna start the whole section

997
01:22:07,649 --> 01:22:14,689
over is there a safe point i'll just for all the people that safe point is so far away i've never

998
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:48,779
seen it before please just do it wrong spot you're wasting but what do you mean wrong spot it's the

999
01:22:48,779 --> 01:23:30,560
end of the pier it takes 10 shots what are people just making this up this is not even the right

1000
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:43,010
dock is this the wrong dock it might not even be in the remake did i just shoot like 20 bullets

1001
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:55,409
for no reason it's the wrong dock it's the wrong dock wrong lake i didn't need that ammo anyways

1002
01:23:55,409 --> 01:24:09,859
who cares it's the wrong game dude you know it's the wrong game no that's i didn't i didn't even

1003

1008
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:35,600
that parry is so fucking cool what an insane addition they added that's awesome you could

1009
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:42,449
probably play through this whole game and parry you broke the knife again it doesn't matter was

1010
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:59,739
it what it was in the other one i don't know wasn't probably missed a few things but okay

1012
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:22,430

01:42:48,130 --> 01:43:03,920
punisher yellow herb or yellow diamond key items that no longer serve a purpose can be sold to the

1066
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:09,920
merchant you know does it what does it tell you that it doesn't serve a purpose anymore

1067
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:25,760
it probably wouldn't be on this list if that were the case right let's sell this for 7500

1068
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:40,510
okay we're selling only okay so these you just sell these these can be inserted

1069
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:45,619
so i got ruby sapphire maybe they go they can go in the uh flagging

1070
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:55,420
still have some new items you might be interested in 4 000 bucks to repair the knife

1071
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:00,699
knife needs care all right this is what i needed to look at could be the difference between

1072
01:44:00,699 --> 01:44:10,979
life this is 1.0 it's 1.10 so they're both the same exact power this one just costs more to

1073
01:44:10,979 --> 01:44:23,180
upgrade if i if i upgrade this it goes they both go to 130 10 19 reload speed is 1.9 it actually

1074
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:30,609
is better rate of fire one rate of fire this is slower though wait one point no that's faster

1075
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:39,840
this is just a better handgun listen to the chat what what are you talking about

1076
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,699
sell all you wait wait wait wait what's going on softlock not locked stop reading

1077
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:55,420
nerd nerd nerd what happened what's going on and his money mate ah this is how you compare

1078
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:11,500
what what's going on what do you mean let me go back here because this is this fit here

1079
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:33,619
so i did this red and blue that's fine right or shift you can redo it red and red is worth more

1080
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:44,210
then i can't do red yellow and blue in the other one yeah it said i didn't need the key you can

1081
01:45:44,210 --> 01:46:04,060
take them out okay 3000 plus 3000 so remove them so this is plus 4000 two color bonus is worth more

1082
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:17,739
okay let's go that's worth more there you get a bonus or save them now why not the duo bonus

1083
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:36,739
is better is it no but but that's 3000 3000 do a bonus times 1.2 is 12 000 that's 4000

1084
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:43,020
this is worth more it's worth more by a hundred that's worth more than by a hundred

1085
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:55,119
it's a difference of 100 wow well only 100 it's still more that might be the one bullet

1086
01:46:55,119 --> 01:47:02,619
that i shoot the boss and kill it save the sapphire you know i'm like so paranoid i hate

1087
01:47:02,619 --> 01:47:12,189
i don't i hate doing these we're pulling them all out okay because i like i know there's other

1088
01:47:12,189 --> 01:47:26,510
shit that i can do later all right let me prepare this okay your weapons are in good hands mate

1090
01:47:35,409 --> 01:47:49,699
with me all right so what about this hours lower on the sunglasses gun reload speed is

1091
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:59,630
much faster rate of fire is faster but really not that big of a deal the regular one's better i

1092
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:07,489
think i'm gonna use sentinel 9 with the ammo in it we're all gonna get replaced anyways maybe

1093
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:11,010
i just won't upgrade anything and say and just have like a million dollars at the end of the stream

1094
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:25,359

1167
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:38,130
that if something's on the ground i'm gonna step in it every time i will step in every single one

1168
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:46,060
of them it's just i'm i just backtrack and run in circles and look around and try to find stuff i

1169
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:55,279
just i don't it may as well not even be on the ground those who that watched my dark wood

1172
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:18,399
my own traps that i put down let's go the right way that game was so horrible god how awful that

1173
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:46,699
game really was it was so scary and so stressful not this time i thought it came out of there and

1174
02:15:46,699 --> 02:16:10,560
was a trap be so fucked up as you're getting imagine get being in the bathroom and having

1175
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:19,140
somebody kick you in the sternum to a point where your back flies up against the wall next to you

1176
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:26,029
the force is so much that without even wiping your ass you get kicked in the chest and your your back

1177
02:16:26,029 --> 02:16:38,420
is planted against the wall and your head up there but the such an awful way to go is there

1178
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:55,979
anything even in here no it's just scary i remember this part not too shabby smoky someone has shown

1179
02:16:56,059 --> 02:17:16,209
up their neighbors i remember this part old photos good wait any other um treasures in here

1184
02:19:31,569 --> 02:19:49,860
um i don't want to spoil the game for you if you haven't seen it but they are in the game okay

1185
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:56,639
people are for their most prized positions the farmer his finest crop slight swine herd stoutest

1186
02:19:56,639 --> 02:20:11,500
pig regularly grandadman her beloved babe crop big babe now where have i seen those before three

1187
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:49,729
things wait guys oh that's not big crystal marble ooh you have any thoughts on counter

1188
02:20:49,729 --> 02:21:15,090
strike two not really i don't really play counter strike at all it feels like a new enemy type

1189
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:29,200
with the necks like this played csgo in like 2011 yeah it's been a long time though counter

1190
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:33,940
striker is always too hard for me and i'm completely fine admitting that and accepting that

1191
02:21:34,659 --> 02:21:42,610
counter strike just felt like it would just just took so much skill to play it

1192
02:21:42,610 --> 02:23:25,379
if you're good at it good for you it's actually kind of hard to control the mouse got it somebody

1193
02:23:25,379 --> 02:23:36,620
can read that later that's not that's really not even a lot of lore either i thought it was going

1194
02:23:36,620 --> 02:24:21,920
to be a lot he has accepted the gift oh yeah i forgot i completely forgot that a to uh is in

1195
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:57,899
this game what do you mean spoiler what those sunglasses are so bad i mean capcom put it in

1196
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:03,100
it was the remake it was 81 accuracy find me another streamer that can do that

1197
02:25:03,819 --> 02:25:11,340
you know what i mean find me like another live streamer on the internet that can get in yeah get

1198
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:31,260
you an 81 percent first try moist head 90 moon moons on hardcore critical has 90 you're you are

1199
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:50,049
lame you're so lame is that funny because there's so many people streaming this probably right now

1200
02:25:51,309 --> 02:26:09,819
there's a lot of really good players like imagine actually making that statement you just did i'm

1201
02:26:09,819 --> 02:26:26,940
kidding it was a joke don't make me put on the pay to win case whoa wait wait wait what are these

1205
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:44,989
like probably five or six days because i just so badly want to just do this but i'm not going to

1206
02:27:44,989 --> 02:28:01,420
whatever all right i mean are these part of it whatever i'll keep them on how many chapters are

1207
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:17,020
in reasoning before just to be a researcher for should have left him in that bag i'm sending you

1208
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:24,530
the details take a look but baby eagle is your priority copy that making my way to the church

1209
02:28:25,170 --> 02:29:00,159
condor one oh i can't go up there i need a right okay i believe this gets a little wacky here

1210
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:07,010
somebody in chat somebody says can you somebody in chat please help me why do i sneeze when i eat

1211
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:14,399
chocolate are you allergic to chocolate would be the first guess maybe you have a mild allergy

1212
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:30,129
to chocolate i don't know be careful food allergies don't work like that i'm not allergic to anything

1213
02:29:30,930 --> 02:30:01,260
it's a bathroom okay wait don't i i swear something's here maybe not well i have the key

1214
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:27,899
oh you too come here come here come here i got you you all right take care of yourself buddy

1215
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:47,709
good dog good dog i can't go that way i can't open this yet right i can but wait is something

1216
02:30:47,709 --> 02:31:18,319
else back there i'll see now this is the way i went before game progress okay creepy

1217
02:31:26,059 --> 02:31:42,000
resources where there's snakes mr treasure it's okay let's get on the next playthrough

1218
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,790
there's no way i'm not going to play i'm going to play through this absolutely guaranteed at

1219
02:31:45,790 --> 02:31:50,530
least like another two or three times probably not on stream i'll probably just do it in my uh

1220
02:31:50,530 --> 02:32:05,420
my own time or something at some point let's do the real treasure hunting so far this runs

1221
02:32:06,139 --> 02:32:13,569
perfectly i'd say it's perfect i haven't seen anything really bad so far i'll like slow down

1222
02:32:13,569 --> 02:32:19,729
so there's been a little bit of a stutter like just a hint loading up some a new area but it's

1223
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:29,360
it's pretty smooth it's pretty solid at like 144 it feels like i have v sync on but it seems

1224
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:49,020
really seems pretty good it'll stutter sometimes in the rain um i think that's all right from what

1225
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:57,649
i remember this resident evil 2 remake engine whatever it is was phenomenal it was very very

1226
02:32:57,649 --> 02:33:20,829
good it's probably one of the better engines i've played our game on what the hell i thought these

1227
02:33:20,829 --> 02:33:41,170
were friends i thought they were friends open oh god oh no no no no no no no no no no no shit

1228
02:33:41,729 --> 02:34:20,909
well that's unfortunate where is it on the stairs okay wait wait wait wait wait i know i gotta do

1229
02:34:20,909 --> 02:35:23,280
this lock up all these doors shit i'm not taking a i'm not healing yet can i close this door okay

1230
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:54,690
i think it's the other way yeah it's the other way i gotta go through that building i think

1231
02:35:54,690 --> 02:36:02,719
shit well where are you i'm good i think i have to go through that building through the window

1232
02:36:02,719 --> 02:36:51,680
yes i do okay we're good late stream yeah oh shit that's bad uh so the game launched at 9 pm

1233
02:36:51,680 --> 02:37:10,340
and i just could not wait another day i want to play it and that's what we're doing can't open

1234
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:27,010
these right cool cool late stream is scary well it makes the game a little scarier because it's

1235
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:34,350
dark i actually like streaming with the camera with the lights down because you can't see all

1236
02:37:34,350 --> 02:38:12,959
like the weird tendencies of my face i like it it's so it's pog oh i don't have let's go i didn't

1239
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:48,239

1240
02:38:48,239 --> 02:39:08,979

i was just like you know what holly was making uh tortillas i could smell it i was just like you

1286
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:41,649
know it was the the pie on the window sill was floating around this late yeah sometimes it's

1287
02:59:41,649 --> 02:59:59,520
what you want that sounds like pretty good weed no uh that is not what uh that's not what just

1288
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:14,829
happened i told you guys before uh i i don't do that on stream not anymore i didn't really

1289
03:00:14,829 --> 03:00:24,989
do it that often anyways but no i just can't i physically would not be able to stream like

1290
03:00:24,989 --> 03:00:41,540
it's been pretty clear after you couldn't read a clock yeah but it was more than that though it

1291
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:52,879
was just i it just my ability to even talk like oh i'm streaming right now what are we gonna talk

1292
03:00:52,879 --> 03:01:02,420
about it was just like i i can't even what this i don't know the streams were kind of like i don't

1293
03:01:02,420 --> 03:01:13,469
even know how to explain it but you know what i mean i thought they were funny they can be fun

1294
03:01:13,469 --> 03:01:19,819
and funny and everything but i also don't want i also don't want to have it be a thing that i'm

1295
03:01:19,819 --> 03:01:24,139
just like oh look i look at how cool this is i'm it's funny i'm high isn't that cool

1296
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:43,200
yeah it's funny to talk about but obviously i don't want it to be a staple of this channel

1297
03:01:43,200 --> 03:02:04,930
anyways i think i'm ready no you get it i don't have to say anymore let's go uh all right make

1298
03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:13,739
sure it's not too loud because of the music i had before good pretty okay that kind of scared this

1299
03:02:13,739 --> 03:02:23,040
shit out of me all right so we good why am i i'm like blue right now why it wasn't like this

1301
03:02:29,309 --> 03:02:32,909
idea how good it is i have no idea how much damage it does i have no idea if it's worth

1302
03:02:32,909 --> 03:02:46,219
actually using we're gonna use it the game is saved let's go i'm gonna send you a strongly

1303
03:02:46,219 --> 03:02:53,729
worded letter um well just just put it in here i mean you can i think you really can do like

1304
03:02:53,729 --> 03:03:03,299
100 200 characters or something but just put it here make mines i'll have to buy the recipe

1305
03:03:03,299 --> 03:03:15,059
it's okay i'll do it in a minute ooh a church i made it how much longer you're gonna be live for

1306
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:24,020
that's a good question i don't want to go too too i'm like doing fine i'm very much awake very much

1307
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:51,979
awake i don't want to go too too late i was at least through the first boss i think that makes

1308
03:03:51,979 --> 03:03:57,090
sense to me that's a good place to stop for tonight i'm trying to think of the schedule for

1309
03:03:57,090 --> 03:04:03,069
this weekend too because i even want to do like technically whatever would be tomorrow like

1310
03:04:03,069 --> 03:04:11,809
tonight tomorrow and maybe sunday or tonight and then saturday sunday trying to think of how i

1311
03:04:11,809 --> 03:04:23,139
should do it probably saturday sunday you can play diablo 4 nah nah i think i got what i wanted out

1312
03:04:23,139 --> 03:04:29,149
of it um it's definitely kind of not enough for me to understand if i really like it or not

1313
03:04:30,049 --> 03:04:36,899
it was fun but i can i can see i can see some cracks that i don't know if it's gonna be

1314
03:04:36,899 --> 03:04:42,500
through all the whole release through the end game of the content i don't know and i think i'd rather

1315
03:04:42,500 --> 03:05:00,510
just just wait it's i'm just gonna wait right miss damn it condor one to roost the church is

1316
03:05:00,510 --> 03:05:07,170
sealed up and baby eagle negative nothing yet but they sure do have this place locked up tight

1317
03:05:07,809 --> 03:05:15,149
i see i can think of one reason they'd want to do so oh she's here that's for sure i'll find a

1318
03:05:15,149 --> 03:05:23,260
way in condor one out but also i mean i don't i don't even know if i'm gonna play d4 i think

1319
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:28,780
the reason why i wanted to play diablo 4 was just because everything i heard leading up to it was

1320
03:05:28,780 --> 03:05:38,500
hey diablo 2 remember that game we remember that game i think that's why i was thinking

1321
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:45,940
about playing it but yeah we'll see if i play it i play it if i don't i don't i don't have like a

1322
03:05:45,940 --> 03:06:00,590
really a plan to um but yeah we'll see we don't talk about diablo 3 diablo 3 was all right it

1323
03:06:00,590 --> 03:06:08,879
was fine i i mean as much as i just wish it was a different game it was the game that it was and

1324
03:06:08,879 --> 03:06:17,200
i played a lot of it i played i've got i got a lot out of that game i did those traitorous twins

1325
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:21,819
should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult someone anyone destroy

1326
03:06:21,819 --> 03:06:29,120
the emblems engraved upon their tombstones destroy the tombstone emblems oh that's easy i can do that

1327
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:58,420
right now is it back here also i said this earlier i think before playing d4 i think blizzard's in

1328
03:06:58,420 --> 03:07:06,139
kind of a weird spot right now where they really kind of they like they need to have something

1329
03:07:06,139 --> 03:07:09,899
right they have to kind of i feel like i haven't really cared about a blizzard game in a long time

1330
03:07:12,399 --> 03:07:18,299
like the last the last i want to say five years have been they've been pretty

1331
03:07:18,299 --> 03:07:33,569
fucked up so i don't know is this it does that count is it what does it want me to destroy

1332
03:07:34,290 --> 03:07:51,860
i said the the twins or something right is it these ones and i look at that note where is it

1333
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:58,270
those traitors twins should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult i think it's

1334
03:07:59,149 --> 03:08:41,440
okay let me in here lakeside map test bro he outsid his om for the irl locker and the

1341

1342
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:34,739
oh yellow diamond i needed that one that's a good one was there anything else out here

1344
03:10:41,780 --> 03:11:17,709
there is look at that where is it oh it's right there hell yeah how can you play so late at night

1345
03:11:17,709 --> 03:11:27,010
and not be scared um i don't know if you were here an hour ago but uh i was it got me a few

1346
03:11:27,090 --> 03:11:40,379
times at least my camera seems to have auto adjusted though because now it's kind of weirdly

1347
03:11:40,379 --> 03:12:34,340
lit in here um is there already get the emblem no i didn't this webcam is like three pixels what

1348
03:12:34,340 --> 03:12:43,379
happened to the one you had in november i have only increased the payments for webcams over the

1349
03:12:43,379 --> 03:12:51,979
last six months i started with a c920 and i used it for years i then bought a logitech brio

1350
03:12:53,200 --> 03:13:01,120
which was way more expensive than the c920 and then i bought the razor one which was i believe

1351
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:08,719
even more expensive than the brio so i just keep adding i just keep throwing money at this problem

1352
03:13:09,680 --> 03:13:19,979
and it doesn't seem to be fixing it this like corporate andy over here is there a problem

1353
03:13:20,459 --> 03:13:25,260
yeah here just i don't know just take that and make it better take that and make it a little

1354
03:13:25,260 --> 03:13:33,649
better for me it didn't work well whatever i don't know just take more of it wait i'm supposed to be

1355
03:13:33,649 --> 03:13:41,620
looking my immersion i think this one looks fine i think this one looks the best out of the three

1356
03:13:41,620 --> 03:14:19,809
of them there's also really dark in here that's come on we gotta be fair what i didn't know that's

1357
03:14:19,809 --> 03:14:48,540
what that was a beautiful lighting effect go on down here oh that's a lot of you hold on hold on

1358
03:14:49,940 --> 03:15:31,629
wait till they jump down before you walk over here very nice somebody behind me more fun to

1359
03:15:31,629 --> 03:15:42,879
play in the dark i actually really don't like no no no no no no no i actually don't really like

1360
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:52,340
bright ass lights really lit up really bright rooms and i hate it it kind of hurts my head

1361
03:15:55,069 --> 03:16:03,219
this room has light in it it's a little lit up but i um i much prefer it slightly dim

1362
03:16:04,879 --> 03:16:15,870
no it's not dark dark in here but it is dim i prefer it that way i would wear sunglasses all

1363
03:16:15,870 --> 03:16:24,739
the time i would be this i would do that i feel like having a little bit of tint darker is just

1364
03:16:24,739 --> 03:17:09,170
makes me feel better what is going on here what is going on where are these people oh stop throwing

1365
03:17:09,569 --> 03:17:32,940
how did i light on fire we gotta go this guy is so bad jesus

1366
03:17:47,280 --> 03:18:16,639
one down more like 10 that guy got in my head because i missed three shots i gotta hold

1367
03:18:16,639 --> 03:18:46,739
didn't i get a yellow herb bolts bolts for the bolt thrower i wonder if that was stupid why are

1368
03:18:46,739 --> 03:19:15,149
you so red because i got a lot of blood i'm gonna try it you can retrieve the ammo which is good yeah

1369
03:19:15,149 --> 03:19:25,100
what does it even look like let's i'm gonna shoot it okay that's pretty cool can i pick

1370
03:19:25,100 --> 03:19:40,379
them up indefinitely what's the reload on it really long very long let's check it out

1371
03:19:40,379 --> 03:20:07,899
kind of blink uh oh that's a good grab good luck finding someone big enough to use this thing

1372
03:20:12,030 --> 03:20:21,069
why do i have so much blood i'm just very very my circulation is very good i have very good

1373
03:20:21,069 --> 03:20:31,600
circulation except my hands get cold all right this is blue medallions and we can actually cheat

1374
03:20:32,319 --> 03:20:46,659
i bought the deluxe edition uh okay actually i should probably heal but

1375
03:20:46,659 --> 03:20:51,149
and let's just go for it you guys already uh this this is one of the coolest parts of the

1376
03:20:51,149 --> 03:20:57,149
game if you guys don't know so in here see all these crows a huge raven boss flies down here

1377
03:20:57,790 --> 03:21:02,510
and picks you up by the back that's why there's all these birds and shit and you have to fight

1378
03:21:02,510 --> 03:21:08,510
the bird while you're flying around um it's unbelievable it was really really cool

1379
03:21:09,229 --> 03:21:12,909
in the regular game i'm just really curious how they do it in this one

1380
03:21:13,709 --> 03:21:17,549
because like you actually have to fight and shoot the bird well it's like it's like clawing you back

1381
03:21:17,549 --> 03:21:21,149
and stuff and it like swings around you go past the church and past buildings this whole aerial

1382
03:21:21,149 --> 03:21:52,700
fight there you go can i take the bolts out yep this thing's actually kind of good i actually

1383
03:21:52,700 --> 03:22:58,430
this is actually pretty good okay we're good all right here we go where's the bird um in a minute

1384
03:22:58,430 --> 03:23:37,950
i had it wrong i see you took care of a request well done i can't believe they cut the iconic

1385
03:23:37,950 --> 03:23:44,420
bird fight i don't think they did now there are enough weapons here to get a party going

1386
03:23:51,420 --> 03:23:57,149
sell them an extra cash upgrade weapon do you do use uh-huh get all the expenses you put back

1387
03:23:57,149 --> 03:24:21,329
into it okay well you've proven yourself reliable what you're buying what a good ring rubies all

1388
03:24:21,329 --> 03:24:29,420
rubbish it makes no difference the price well that's our choice to make well these you just

1389
03:24:29,420 --> 03:24:39,979
get rid of these for selling only that's good a deal well struck take these two vipers well done

1390
03:24:39,979 --> 03:25:00,430
stranger and one more viper i still use all this stuff you're much good in here sure there's some

1391
03:25:00,430 --> 03:25:09,250
things money can't i think i'm gonna buy with this right this is probably not a bad idea

1392
03:25:12,659 --> 03:25:22,700
i don't think it's a bad idea i'm gonna get it you can't go wrong with that all right bolt

1393
03:25:22,700 --> 03:25:30,879
thrower probably maybe ammo capacity ready to fire are in good hands mate i'll see you right

1394
03:25:30,879 --> 03:25:40,780
i'll just make this thing deadly yeah this thing is filthy now an idea of your tastes

1395
03:25:40,780 --> 03:25:57,340
friend 1.8 this thing is filthy where would it what can i do don't get yourself killed now

1396
03:25:57,340 --> 03:26:12,399
all right one more viper and i get that okay let's make this i have a two don't i here we go

1397
03:26:12,399 --> 03:26:28,450
wait a minute hold on wait wait wait how come i can't put that it wants me to use two of these

1398
03:26:28,450 --> 03:26:37,920
but i already have one don't i already is this gonna take two and make another one don't i

1399
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:51,120
already have one last option yeah that's the right one yeah i was gonna try to put it in this one

1400
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:56,299
but i forgot i had these two i forgot i had these two red and greens so that's good all right so

1401
03:26:56,299 --> 03:27:03,950
this is a i'm probably just gonna take this now it's a full heal now wait until you really need

1402
03:27:03,950 --> 03:27:15,120

1405
03:27:56,079 --> 03:28:09,440
i kind of sprinted down here and there is something else here that right here can't do this

1406
03:28:12,530 --> 03:28:40,989

1416
03:30:48,739 --> 03:30:54,670
be careful shooting a sailor will deduct points some targets cannot be destroyed with one shot

1417

shoot as many shots as it takes until they break if certain conditions are met bonus targets will

did i get them all i think i got them all i got them all didn't i i got them all what did i miss

1472
03:58:45,299 --> 03:58:53,020
spinning one sometimes have a skull on the single side in the back you mean okay so i'm

1473
03:58:54,190 --> 03:59:37,309
all right that was a very bad display go go go go go go go go go go go go go

1474
03:59:37,870 --> 04:00:34,239
are we good are we good are we good i don't know five out of seven again where the fuck are the

1475
04:00:34,239 --> 04:00:43,420
other two where are the other two the first spinning sword pirate has one first spinning

1476
04:00:43,420 --> 04:00:48,139
the first spinning pirate between the two sailors has one in his chest but only on one side it shows

1477
04:00:48,139 --> 04:00:59,659
first spinning one at the beginning it's hidden behind the person with the barrel what okay let

1478
04:00:59,659 --> 04:01:21,219
me just see where they are really that's how many times did you shoot that guy have one okay

1479
04:01:21,860 --> 04:01:49,459
all right now i know where they are we're good so those are the two that i was missing

1480
04:01:50,260 --> 04:01:53,620
just don't fuck it up i said don't fuck it up

1481
04:02:27,760 --> 04:02:58,139
reload that quick that's it i got it i got i got i got them all right i got them all got them all

1482
04:02:58,139 --> 04:03:34,059
yes okay let's go let's go give me more plus 30% attachable mines craft i mean that's

1483
04:03:34,540 --> 04:03:46,930
okay but what i use i wouldn't say that's worth three golden coins are there even any other

1484
04:03:46,930 --> 04:03:59,709
rarities in the game well i can't get many i can't get any more gold coins from this

1485
04:04:00,590 --> 04:04:16,340
there's probably more later i need to go into my inventory that was really fun though that's cool

1486
04:04:21,020 --> 04:04:26,899
mix the coins up next time well three but i mean three gold coins that should give you something

1487
04:04:26,899 --> 04:04:39,920
i am bright i can look over and see in the obs preview i am red what happened well that blood

1488
04:04:39,920 --> 04:04:52,940
came up to my face okay so customized case i should probably put this one on then right this

1489
04:04:52,940 --> 04:05:07,379
is you get more do i want more handgun ammo or more money probably money are we done for today

1490
04:05:07,379 --> 04:05:33,420
not yet i mean i feel like that's pretty good they stack don't i craft shotgun shells all the time

1491
04:05:34,059 --> 04:05:46,319
yeah this is a cool idea i like it this is a cool addition uh speaking of crafting breaks over i

1492
04:05:46,959 --> 04:06:18,209
let's go ahead and do that now i need gunpowder okay let's keep going i don't really have any

1493
04:06:18,209 --> 04:06:38,909
money i did what i wanted to do and let's continue okay um should heal with the herb um i will

1494
04:06:38,909 --> 04:06:52,819
eventually so the i have a question listen the the bird boss right how come the bird boss didn't

1495
04:06:54,459 --> 04:07:04,799
activate you know why did the bird boss not activate right you know what i mean it's it's

1496
04:07:04,799 --> 04:07:28,620
different okay you're good you're good okay on the way back okay this is really really great so far

1497
04:07:28,620 --> 04:07:44,750
it's really good i mean this game is just phenomenal on regardless of what version it is

1498
04:07:45,309 --> 04:07:52,030
but it does feel pretty great to come back to this so we talked about how i wish i could like

1499
04:07:52,030 --> 04:08:00,340
wipe my memory and play all the from software games again this kind of feels like that so this

1500
04:08:00,340 --> 04:08:16,430
is really cool really enjoying it so far is anything i do anything hey is that the right dock

1501
04:08:17,229 --> 04:08:41,040
i don't i don't think so there you are i can't do anything else here i think i just have to leave

1502
04:08:41,040 --> 04:09:13,840
okay goodbye and then we go out to the right so wait no it's wait where am i going here okay

1503
04:09:13,840 --> 04:09:21,950
it's okay why are you up so late because the game released late and i wanted to jump in on it at

1504
04:09:21,950 --> 04:09:28,510
least on the launch day because i was very excited for this and it's really really cool and i'm glad

1505
04:09:28,510 --> 04:09:51,389
i did because it's been really fun i'm going to continue playing this this is pretty much what

1506
04:09:51,389 --> 04:10:34,350
i'm going to be doing all weekend so yeah i'm going to finish it this weekend whoa although

1515
04:12:45,010 --> 04:12:56,479
shit okay hold on can you do it again i missed it i have a really cool trick that you are gonna

1516
04:12:56,479 --> 04:13:04,000
learn right now if you miss something during the stream then i am red like this has to change now

1517
04:13:04,000 --> 04:13:24,909
like this is ridiculous my room is red right now it's not me i swear it's the color correction on

1518
04:13:24,909 --> 04:13:39,709
the camera see what i mean look look what just happened this is what it actually looks like in

1519
04:13:39,709 --> 04:13:51,760
here it looks like i still am red i'm a red i'm a whatever it's too late to get annoyed by this

1520
04:13:52,319 --> 04:14:17,500
that's better that's fine that's fine you need to put the hero filter on to match this

1521
04:14:20,350 --> 04:14:29,299
i don't care there's so much blood swirling around in here i told you guys that people like oh wow

1522
04:14:30,180 --> 04:14:37,940
how can you stay so thin i mean how do you stay like that you must exercise no guys i burn so

1523
04:14:37,940 --> 04:14:46,819
many calories just by existing i swear to you my body is just constantly just revved up machine

1524
04:14:47,540 --> 04:14:53,379
i have these dreams that are real life up here it's like i burned more calories than i in my

1525
04:14:53,379 --> 04:14:59,920
dreams than i do when i'm awake i'm constantly my body is constantly just producing energy

1526
04:15:03,040 --> 04:15:09,280
if you like put two little wires on me i could probably power a fucking clock like a potato

1527
04:15:19,950 --> 04:15:29,840
he's flexing on all us normal people that that did sound a little braggy that sounded a little

1528
04:15:29,840 --> 04:15:36,819
braggy but that's not what i meant by that that was that was a little braggy okay i admit but

1529
04:15:36,819 --> 04:15:55,899
that's not what i mean all right back to it i got everything right jeez germa i wish i had super

1530
04:15:55,899 --> 04:16:52,100

1532
04:17:13,819 --> 04:17:26,879
different places now what is in here it's random wait it's not placed individually it's random

1533
04:17:26,879 --> 04:17:36,639
i didn't know it was random i thought there was actually place there come on fill the tank when

1534
04:17:36,639 --> 04:17:45,680
you're done get me out here most resident evil games were that way i don't remember them being

1535
04:17:45,680 --> 04:18:03,100
random i guess certain key placement is certain items are there not random need two more of those

1536
04:18:03,100 --> 04:18:25,579
nice well i'm about to craft one of these anyways so let's go i'm gonna blow through these i think

1537
04:18:25,579 --> 04:18:35,469
at some point here not enough gunpowder reroll the loot shoot the water that was pretty good

1538
04:18:35,469 --> 04:18:46,100
louie i don't want to reroll it all right back to did i get everything oh wait a minute this is

1539
04:18:46,100 --> 04:19:21,020

1542
04:20:32,510 --> 04:20:46,899

1543
04:20:49,569 --> 04:21:58,979
get off me this gun is fucking stupid do it it's not that bad i did lose one of my bolts though

1544
04:21:58,979 --> 04:22:25,309
i don't know why they're in the water somewhere whatever right right right i didn't do it right

1545
04:22:25,309 --> 04:23:10,270
but i tried it's too late to do that dude stop there's so much more money and shit down here

1546
04:23:10,270 --> 04:23:28,959
yeah keep going where i came from right yeah i don't know you're going to blow up like the

1547
04:23:28,959 --> 04:23:47,969
guy from big trouble in little china what why do i why do i know what that is do i know what that

1548
04:23:47,969 --> 04:24:51,420
is that's a classic movie swing what the hell oh whoa they're behind me oh somebody swung at me

1549
04:24:51,420 --> 04:25:45,809
where'd they go see that did you see the axe when i what it was weird sit down oh i need to

1550
04:25:45,809 --> 04:25:57,709
there we go good that should free up some space it didn't free up any space i need to craft some

1551
04:25:57,709 --> 04:26:12,059
shit uh all right i'm gonna go two two green herbs just free up some space you look like a very tired

1552
04:26:12,059 --> 04:26:43,870
john wick yeah i'm thinking i'm back what you told me i'm gonna say something if you say it like

1553
04:26:43,870 --> 04:26:50,209
you don't you can't minus two that many times you'll crash my computer don't do that you're

1554
04:26:50,209 --> 04:27:13,840
gonna crash my computer if you do that stop i hear beeps oh my god thank goodness i didn't do that

1555
04:27:14,559 --> 04:27:27,860
if you say that was funny and then you write minus two it is automatically not counted

1556
04:27:27,860 --> 04:27:32,780
i just want to make sure you understand that but the algorithm picks up if you said like how

1557
04:27:32,780 --> 04:27:52,559
omega l minus two and that does not count you negate it i understand the appeal of this thing

1558
04:27:52,559 --> 04:27:57,520
and i'm starting to get why it's kind of cool because it's effectively infinite ammo if you're

1559
04:27:57,520 --> 04:28:18,500
good at shooting which i don't know how good i am with that where is this beep sure it's good

1560
04:28:18,500 --> 04:28:32,879
for stealth uh there's one more of those where is it where's this medallion i think it's probably

1561
04:28:32,879 --> 04:28:51,889
on the outside oh chest i can't carry any more of these i'm just gonna eat one of them where's

1562
04:28:51,889 --> 04:29:22,829
that medallion there it is last one need one more just a lot of these i can't take anymore

1563
04:29:22,829 --> 04:30:02,510
an egg boat fuel go back to the boat who just puts an egg in their pocket this is a little

1564
04:30:02,510 --> 04:30:15,379
weird but is it really stays fresh i don't like it as long as you don't break it i'm gonna leave

1565
04:30:15,379 --> 04:30:43,870
that there in case i need to eat it later you look like you want revenge today oh my god be careful

1566
04:30:43,870 --> 04:31:49,979
but i just ripped it oops a lot of money all right back to the boat i wonder how much harder

1567
04:31:49,979 --> 04:32:07,260
hard hardcore is because the parry makes hardcore i think not as bad it's a lot harder oh well i

1568
04:32:07,260 --> 04:32:12,700
think with the parry that would be wouldn't be too awful as long as you did the parry right okay i

1569
04:32:12,700 --> 04:32:32,850
gotta go back up this way it's too hard you're a baby you know about me anyways what do you know

1570
04:32:32,850 --> 04:32:55,389
about me what do you know about me too much somebody said uh i want to save the game because

1571
04:32:55,389 --> 04:33:01,379
i'm a little concerned that i'm gonna get killed here and i don't want to go all the way back i

1572
04:33:01,379 --> 04:33:13,099
don't think there's a checkpoint before this so i'm gonna save don't listen to the haters you did

1573
04:33:13,099 --> 04:33:40,349
nancy drew on senior mode yeah yes i did what am i going idiot i want to go back oh it's this way

1574
04:33:40,909 --> 04:34:00,270
did i get any more trinkets to sell because i kind of want to upgrade the shotgun

1575
04:34:03,069 --> 04:34:13,439
took care of a request did you i knew i could count on you oh what you're buying a well-tuned

1576
04:34:13,439 --> 04:34:31,470
weapon can make up for a lack of skill friend this kind of work is about finesse stranger little

1577
04:34:31,470 --> 04:34:39,709
b goes a long way you see did i already do the viper thing did i do the viper thing already

1578
04:34:41,069 --> 04:34:50,099
pleasure doing business with you that should be it right all right cool a job well done deserves

1579
04:34:50,099 --> 04:34:57,919
payment in kind where would it what can i do you there's some things money can't buy

1580
04:34:58,880 --> 04:35:02,419
i'm not sure i'm not sure it's kind of cool maybe should i see what is better

1581
04:35:03,060 --> 04:35:19,759
or just get the laser sight treasure map i think i already have it it's a bad gun i think i already

1582
04:35:19,759 --> 04:35:28,209
have the treasure map because i have the lux edition are you guys lying or is that real let's

1583
04:35:28,209 --> 04:35:40,110
get the laser yeah laser sights you can't come back anytime okay i need this laser sight didn't

1584
04:35:40,110 --> 04:35:47,569
this used to take up inventory space did they change that i thought it took up inventory space

1585
04:35:48,860 --> 04:35:59,900
it still does it does i thought it was an actual item in the oh it is right there okay yeah yep

1586
04:35:59,900 --> 04:36:45,439
okay do i want to store anything i'm all right oh i got a bonus why is it so dark in your room

1587
04:36:45,439 --> 04:36:49,279
uh because i turned the lights off because it's a scary game well relatively scary

1588
04:36:50,080 --> 04:36:55,310
you can turn it up a little bit now though there that's a little bit

1589
04:36:58,860 --> 04:37:06,290
sell the necklace please uh i don't want to sell the necklace because i want to fill it welcome

1590
04:37:06,930 --> 04:37:11,970
got a selection of good things i want a full necklace because then it's probably worth like

1591
04:37:11,970 --> 04:37:17,970
40 grand she makes no difference the price at the treasure map that's our choice i have a yellow

1592
04:37:17,970 --> 04:37:29,040
but it's not the right size it needs to be a square or rectangle okay let's do this part

1593
04:37:29,759 --> 04:37:45,729
i'm now confident i have a save point i'm good let's go or something maybe i should just store

1594
04:37:45,729 --> 04:38:01,939
this yeah i like it but taking up a lot of space right now you have the stench of i also need to

1595
04:38:03,139 --> 04:38:06,500
i need to i need to throw some flashbang these things are just taking up so much space

1596
04:38:07,139 --> 04:38:15,229
throw some flashbangs throw some grenades why are these not in a stack like these are

1597
04:38:15,229 --> 04:38:31,389
what these are in a stack of four why is that how come these won't stack oh oh that's a hot key

1598
04:38:32,189 --> 04:38:39,540
that's okay i see i can't store the bolts and i don't want to throw the bolts away because

1599
04:38:40,500 --> 04:38:55,549
how am i going to get any more i don't think you can store um ammo put it down yeah i can't

1600
04:38:55,549 --> 04:39:08,479
store it that's okay i have plenty of room uh i got plenty of ammo i wouldn't want to use this

1601
04:39:08,479 --> 04:39:12,159
here anyways because i would lose all the i'd lose all the bolts anyways all right let's go

1602
04:39:12,720 --> 04:39:29,889
i'm ready uh probably gonna call it after this encounter here i did say i wanted to put a kind

1603
04:39:29,889 --> 04:39:37,119

1605
04:39:42,020 --> 04:39:50,400

1606
04:39:50,400 --> 04:39:54,990
probably going to be a long stream i'm going to really grind this out on saturday sunday is going

1607
04:39:54,990 --> 04:40:02,959
to be another stream where i really kind of grind it out on sunday i think that's probably i should

1608
04:40:02,959 --> 04:40:08,299
be able to beat it in another three streams or so but i here's the thing i don't want to rush this

1609
04:40:08,299 --> 04:40:12,159
so i've been obviously this game's awesome it's probably one of the best games it's going to come

1610
04:40:12,159 --> 04:40:20,860
out this whole year i'm going to take my time with it so we'll see i'm imagining i'll probably

1611
04:40:20,860 --> 04:40:30,259
stream it at least probably four or five times yeah it won't be like this uh on saturday because

1612
04:40:30,259 --> 04:40:35,490
i had to start really really late today because it came out really late i was just itching to play

1613
04:40:35,490 --> 04:41:00,080
it so loud are you gonna do a massive bong rip on cam for 420 i don't think so this is so loud

1614
04:41:00,080 --> 04:42:19,500
why did it get so much louder okay yes you didn't say no throw harpoons right in the mouth where you

1615
04:42:19,500 --> 04:42:34,000
going where you going where you going where is he whoa how do i turn up what do i go all right why

1616
04:42:34,000 --> 04:43:16,340
is this not driving oh i ran into there what you can swallow me i'm moving oh shit come on aim better

1617
04:43:16,340 --> 04:45:11,650
god damn it whoa what the hell oh that hurt there it is just as easy as it was in the original

1618
04:45:11,650 --> 04:45:32,639
it's a cool fight though i like it shades you're playing on the baby mode no i'm playing on

1619
04:45:33,279 --> 04:45:59,310
standard okay that was interesting it's late at night i don't care i'm gonna tell you um i

1620
04:46:02,340 --> 04:46:07,700
i just was leaning back and i was i kind of put my hand well on like the kind of bottom lower back

1621
04:46:07,700 --> 04:46:13,060
part of my back just to kind of stretch a little and i ended up i kind of with my other thumb

1622
04:46:13,060 --> 04:46:19,459
lifted kind of my pants and went i kind of pulled them out a little like oh i'm just gonna like the

1623
04:46:19,459 --> 04:46:26,430
elastic here i'm gonna pull back it was like 180 degree air that just came out that was hot

1624
04:46:26,430 --> 04:46:35,470
it was burning hot air that just came from that area that was like hot like burning hot

1625
04:46:36,029 --> 04:46:48,639
i'm telling you i am on fire all day people think i'm a liar i'm i like i'm just like on fire

1626
04:46:48,639 --> 04:47:16,740
take 80 come on you're sweating dude shit yourself oh my god that's so stupid dude have you had a

1627
04:47:16,740 --> 04:47:18,740
fever for the last 10 years

1628
04:48:00,959 --> 04:48:09,229
they're even on in my nightmares i don't know if you would have the sunglasses on in a nightmare

1629
04:48:09,790 --> 04:48:15,259
these things are welded to his head this is part of his body those are just his eyes

1630
04:48:27,200 --> 04:48:43,250
you wouldn't condor wonder roost do you read me condor one you've been radio silent for three

1631
04:48:43,250 --> 04:48:51,419
hours are you all right yeah i'm fine why did you sleep in the boat i'm still looking for whatever

1632
04:48:51,419 --> 04:48:59,090
key i need copy that i mean once that big monster is dead i feel like it's probably relatively

1633
04:48:59,090 --> 04:49:04,860
safe out there in the boat kind of away from all the crazy shit like once you get rid of the big

1634
04:49:04,860 --> 04:49:10,459
monster just be right in the middle of the lake and just go to bed i think you'd be pretty safe

1635
04:49:11,180 --> 04:49:18,380
unless there's a second monster which look i feel like the first monster encounter would have woken

1636
04:49:18,380 --> 04:49:23,740
up the second monster so there's definitely no second monster there's no way you sleep through

1637
04:49:23,740 --> 04:49:30,060
that if you're a second monster you're a second monster you hear that and you go investigate be

1638
04:49:30,060 --> 04:49:43,490
going anywhere in this thing uh i'm gonna wrap it up here i'm gonna just get to another save point

1639
04:49:43,490 --> 04:50:19,169
which i think this one probably right here soon okay i thought that was a demon or something i

1640
04:50:19,169 --> 04:50:23,099
thought this thing attacked me i thought it was a giant moth i was like what do they add to the

1641
04:50:23,099 --> 04:50:50,049
game why is it what is this i do like the little additions here and there though it's very fun

1642
04:50:50,689 --> 04:51:41,970
okay that's where i came from go over here it's just like hurt my eyes what are you doing i would

1643
04:51:41,970 --> 04:51:47,330
somebody said cs go maneuver yeah i was trying to flash him because i think they're up on the hill

1644
04:51:47,889 --> 04:51:54,849
imagine you're like doing like a religious chant and up on the hill like it's some crazy cult or

1645
04:51:54,849 --> 04:52:01,279
something else like a flashbang lands in front of you would you notice or would you be still

1646
04:52:01,279 --> 04:52:12,419
doing this and what would happen do you stop the chant or is it like oh we gotta keep going like

1647
04:52:12,419 --> 04:52:34,959
we can't stop how does that work i was wondering what they were gonna look like in the remake

1648
04:52:35,279 --> 04:54:34,509
what is this place some kind of shrine same mark from the church okay i need need an item here

04:58:01,869 --> 04:58:21,700
not knowing those drop pretty frequently from what i remember all right i want to go if i

1663
04:58:21,700 --> 04:58:46,590

i can oh i can complete that um necklace whatever it is red nine that thing's pretty good from what

1666
04:59:27,680 --> 04:59:37,200
i remember i might just upgrade that thing to full that gun used to be the beast that that is the

1667
04:59:37,200 --> 04:59:40,799
right one right that's the one that you just always use that one they probably fixed it they

1668
04:59:40,799 --> 04:59:51,310
probably changed it so the other stuff is better i remember that thing was unstoppable okay i

1669
04:59:51,310 --> 05:00:12,610
need honestly i need to i need to save where's the nearest safe point i'm gonna go this way

1673
05:01:27,299 --> 05:01:38,349
test just for fun one day and i don't remember i think dasani was not even that low for me yeah

1674
05:01:38,349 --> 05:01:45,979
well we we just do things sometimes we just hang out together i forget what my my favorite one was

1675
05:01:45,979 --> 05:02:08,860
my number one was that dasani was not even really that low it was pretty low but it wasn't like f

1676
05:02:10,080 --> 05:02:16,479
i probably would surprise people with where i put something i'm gonna i'm gonna get punched in the

1677
05:02:16,479 --> 05:02:31,229
face for saying this i think i'm good someone is going to to be very upset with me there they go

1678
05:02:31,229 --> 05:02:46,099
they're already punching there look at they're already punching um core water is like i think

1679
05:02:46,099 --> 05:03:03,060
it was like pretty low i didn't really like core water the one with the blue cap it's blue it's

1680
05:03:03,060 --> 05:03:21,409
kind of slim looks like it's like a got a blue twist off big blue twist off cap yeah um what

1681
05:03:21,409 --> 05:03:33,389
did i give i wait i gave dasani a b no i gave no i didn't i gave dasani a b no no no no no

1682
05:03:33,389 --> 05:03:47,540
that's wrong that's wrong it's wrong it's wrong that's not smart water was an a you're sleep

1683
05:03:47,540 --> 05:03:56,909
deprived show the list we don't really have a list now dasani was what dasani was was a c

1684
05:03:58,610 --> 05:04:09,279
but core was was the lowest for me what would you what about tap water depends on where you

1685
05:04:09,279 --> 05:04:17,150
fucking live i mean this some tap water like tastes very different i don't know i like vegas

1686
05:04:17,150 --> 05:04:23,619
tap water versus like california tap water versus like hawaii tap water versus massachusetts tap

1687
05:04:23,619 --> 05:04:33,380
water it's i don't i don't know very different new york city tap water yeah it's very different

1688
05:04:33,380 --> 05:04:44,990
new york city tap water versus vegas tap water i assure you is very different oh my goodness okay

1689
05:04:44,990 --> 05:04:51,580
i water our water is fine whatever i don't prefer it asani though smart water is usually what i would

1690
05:04:51,580 --> 05:04:59,180
want fiji okay fiji doesn't count for me because fiji would just blow everything away i don't think

1691
05:04:59,180 --> 05:05:06,959
i i i don't think i'm allowed to put it on the list because i don't know isn't fiji fiji's like

1692
05:05:06,959 --> 05:05:18,130
you can't even come close i don't buy fiji though i don't actually buy it you know where i buy fiji

1693
05:05:18,130 --> 05:05:26,830
water it's one of the only places i buy it the airport that's it i don't ever buy it anywhere

1694
05:05:26,830 --> 05:05:34,669
else it's just at the airport and it's funny because fiji's already kind of expensive isn't it

1695
05:05:34,669 --> 05:05:40,049
so it's even more expensive at the airport so i'm buying arguably one of the more expensive

1696
05:05:40,049 --> 05:05:49,419
waters on earth at the most expensive place on earth it's like the water is very very expensive

1697
05:05:49,419 --> 05:06:00,000
in the airport vacation packaging crystal geyser is s actually i would probably agree with you

1698
05:06:02,479 --> 05:06:15,740
all right that's a weird flex no i just i just told you i don't buy it i buy it at the airport

1699
05:06:15,740 --> 05:06:20,639
which is just like oh yeah sure fiji you know what it is because you want to make sure like anytime

1700
05:06:20,639 --> 05:06:28,080
i travel i want to make sure that i am in peak performance mode peak physical hydration peak

1701
05:06:28,080 --> 05:06:34,610
mental fortitude and a fiji water to me is like all right that is that's good shit and i'm going

1702
05:06:34,610 --> 05:06:39,790
to make sure i drink that because i i'm about to go on an airplane i wanted to be the best

1703
05:06:39,790 --> 05:06:49,180
because i'm going on a plane i planes suck already everybody knows that all right we'll see you

1704
05:06:49,180 --> 05:07:09,310
saturday i need to be peak performance to get on a plane doesn't matter remember what would you do

1705
05:07:09,310 --> 05:07:25,470
if you got the t-virus um i close myself off in a room and just i don't know like booby trap the

1706
05:07:25,470 --> 05:07:31,310
room i'm in because like the t-virus is going to get out of me and try to get out like it's

1707
05:07:31,310 --> 05:07:34,990
gonna be like an alien right so i'll just like booby trap the whole room just stay in there

1708
05:07:35,630 --> 05:07:40,110
and then eventually like it'll get out and i'd like run into the fucking home alone shit that

1709
05:07:40,110 --> 05:07:48,130
i made for it it won't know it'll it'll be like like out of my chest and go to the door like

1710
05:07:49,490 --> 05:07:56,220
and then a big paint can just hits right in the face and falls back onto the toy cars i put all

1711
05:07:56,220 --> 05:08:11,520
