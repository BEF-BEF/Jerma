1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:10,679
Okay, hello. How are you? We're going to move on to Cities Skylines. I gotta change this title to

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,399
Picking Up Apples and Carrots for Five Hours. It doesn't make any sense anymore. So we're going to

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:40,859
name it Back to Wink Dink City. Cities Skylines. You didn't play for five hours. I played for four.

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,689
So I think I got my fill of Animal Crossing for the day and we're going to do that every day.

5
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:58,469
Well, what I mean by that is every stream day we will finish with Animal Crossing.

6
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,379
So that's kind of what you can expect. At least for the next couple weeks, I would assume.

7
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:21,909
All right, back to it. Here we go. And you'll be able to see it on your screen. See it? Yes, you do.

8
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:29,189
Okay, so Cities Skylines. We're going to load game. This is before. That was very loud. Make sure I

9
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:38,859
turn this down. Which one? Not the autosave. Where's the one before the explosions? It was

10
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:50,409
yes. Yes, it was this one. Okay, so first of all, we had a ton of money come in. We had 5,000 bits.

11
00:01:50,409 --> 00:02:01,049
50 buck drop right now from Filactory Lich. Let me just take a quick sip of water. They say,

12
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,450
hey, Jerma, you're really bad at making roads. Just so you know, you can download pre-made cities

13
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,819
just to fuck with them. Download a copy of Boston. No, I want to make my own shit. I don't want a

14
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:19,180
pre-made city. No, I want to make my stuff from scratch. I don't want to go open up the freezer

15
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,099
and go take out a fucking kid cuisine and put it in the microwave for 25 seconds. No, I want to go

16
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,530
get the batter. I want to go get the chicken and I'm going to make it from scratch on my stovetop.

17
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:39,560
Even if it's easier that way. And even if this food comes out to be poisonous and not edible and

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:53,180
it'll hurt and people will get hurt if they eat it. But thank you for the 50 bucks. Appreciate it.

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:02,500
Just let's try to figure out where we were before. Change the title. The title's changed. Back to

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:11,430
Winged Ink City. The city is beyond saving. Yeah, it was left in a really bad state. I gotta work on

21
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:27,020
the trash. Forget about the fucking roads. We'll do that later. Forget about the roads. All right,

22
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:40,860
it's been a full day. This is awful. Who fucking made this? I don't even feel like I did this.

23
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:55,590
I think I fell asleep and somebody took over. This is working as intended. Those of you that,

24
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,490
okay, those of you that were not here yesterday, I made it so the highway, any cars that are on the

25
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,979
highway have to have to go through the toll and go through the scenic Statue of Liberty.

26
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,360
And when they have to go this way, this is the only way to go on the highway.

27
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:19,319
You go up there. There's a toll every 15 feet. This keeps going. Every toll is as high as the

28
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:28,680
price can possibly get. And eventually that leads you to, you can go left. Left takes you back all

29
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600
the way around, which will eventually take you down here back to the actual highway.

30
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,959
If you, this is what happens when you take the highway. Or you bang a right and come and join

31
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:50,019
our little town here. We have a nice little community. Okay. Oh man. I kind of don't,

32
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:58,139
I kind of want to just, this is bad. All right. We're fine. What do I need? I'm not enough

33
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,310
educated workers. We need industry. A lot of it, but we don't have enough fucking workers.

34
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,350
Not enough buyers for products. No, we need commercial. Commercial. What do we look like?

35
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:18,579
Terrible, terrible, terrible commercial buildings. Okay. All right. I know what I want to do.

36
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,639
We are going to build out from here. We're going to have some commercial out this way.

37
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,339
That's the plan. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to be a bunch of commercial. Double roads.

38
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:49,220
Uh, right over here. What's this? Double down on the tolls and legalize weed.

39
00:05:50,100 --> 00:06:26,069
I want a curved road to go like this. Why, why is there so many palm trees? And you got a toll

40
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:33,910
to come in here? No. All right. Commercial. High density commercial around the whole thing.

41
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:53,509
We need more goods. Here we go. All right. This just had to build up. I need a ton of industry.

42
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,699
I need more commercial for industry though. Just keep going down this way with commercial. Just

43
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:06,139
make a ton of it. Like this don't matter. Just make a bunch of it and then I'll make some industry

44
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,980
down here. This is all in this. Is this industry? What is this? What the hell is this? What is this?

45
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:27,939
These houses? Oh, they're not labeled. Oh, it's high density. High density. Okay. I got to,

46
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:34,790
fuck. Wait, how are people going to go to these businesses? There's no way people can't go to

47
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:54,540
these. There's a dirt road. Are these all going to be drive-throughs? Uh, fuck. Just make them houses.

48
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,139
No, I can't. This is fucked up. How do I delete this? Just delete them all. This is the, I can't

49
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:09,459
do anything right here. I got to plan this shit out too. All right. How does it look over here?

50
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:16,629
All right. Commercial buildings going up. There's plenty of this web street. Okay. All right. There's

51
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:36,860
enough room. That'll build out. Then, oh, we need water and shit here. Good. Okay. Electricity is

52
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:52,659
already here, right? Yes, it is. Is there electricity? There's electricity here. There's no,

53
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,779
no, there's not, there's not shit in the water pipes. I fixed that. Remember? I have the cleaning

54
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:08,710
unit here. Another 50 fucking dollars. Holy shit. That's like, this is like three 50 dollar

55
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:15,899
bit drops in a row in the last like hour. Oh my God. This is from Trans Scout TF2.

56
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,629
Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars. I say, hey Jerm, I hope you're doing all right. I want to

57
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,990
drop in and thank you for the silly shit you do. It really brightens my day. Things have been kind

58
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,470
of upside down since my mom got diagnosed with ALS. Sorry if that's weird to mention.

59
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,779
Uh, but watching your streams helps things feel more normal. Also, the city makes me want to scream.

60
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,279
Well, me too. It makes me want to scream too. But I'm really sorry to hear about your

61
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:53,500
mother's diagnosis. I'm really sorry to hear that. I don't know that much about ALS, but

62
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:04,059
it's manageable from what I've heard. I'm really sorry to hear about it though,

63
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:23,799
at least enough. Steven Hillenberg died from it. Yeah, that's horrible. Unfortunately,

64
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,159
it's not. Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different one. A different illness, but

65
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:45,450
I'm really sorry to hear about it regardless. But yeah, take care of yourself. I wish you the

66
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:58,940
best. I wish your family the best too. You're probably thinking of MS. Yeah, probably.

67
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:12,549
Probably. But thanks for the 5,000 bits. Completely unnecessary. But thank you.

68
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:45,379
Let's get rid of these houses. Okay, I have a question. If a house is abandoned,

69
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,980
does that mean... is that because there are too many... is that because... what am I doing wrong

70
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,549
here? I mean, don't answer that question because very obviously the thing you're looking at right

71
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:04,250
now is... that could be one of the reasons. It could be one of the reasons why. Don't answer

72
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:13,210
that very immediately. I need industry now. Oh, fuck those commercial buildings. All right,

73
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:22,600
up, up, up, up, up. Industries down here. All right, let's do it. Let's do a double road.

74
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,830
I'll work on toll road once this is done. Steve, what the fuck are you talking about?

75
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:53,850
All right, industry. A lot of it. You're making a maze. I wish it would stop. It's been raining

76
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,169
for a year. Will it stop fucking raining? You don't need more industry. What? High demand for

77
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:15,419
industry. That's what that means. The Statue of Liberty is trashed. Wait, hold on. Garbage. Oh,

78
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:23,299
yeah. You got a garbage truck. I can't get here. Wait, is there a garbage truck on the way? What's

79
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:43,000
going on here? All right, I need a hospital. How many hospitals do... okay, I don't have any up here.

80
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:54,360
There's a hospital. There we go. Right here. Another one over here. I don't have enough money.

81
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,139
How much is a... fuck, a hospital is expensive. We'll do this. Crematorium. Wait, that's a hospital

82
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:13,559
for one street? Yeah, but they're so disconnected. Remember the ambulance that drove around the

83
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:28,789
entire city? Medical clinic. I'm just trying to work things out here. All right, what's going on

84
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:43,909
with this? It doesn't even need to be here. What's this? Not enough fuel. Coal power plant.

85
00:14:51,779 --> 00:15:02,200
No, no, no, no. I didn't even do this one. I didn't even do this one. No. What's this?

86
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:10,759
Not enough raw materials. Wait, we're out of materials. What's a materials map? Should I

87
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:27,740
sell all this shit and move it? A thunderstorm is battering the city. Stay indoors until the storm

88
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:44,950
is passed. Everybody get inside. Stay indoors. Don't come out. No, not the university. Everyone's

89
00:15:44,950 --> 00:16:09,610
fine so far. We're okay. How long does it last? I mean they can't go inside. Why is there no power?

90
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:26,649
No. Consumption 290. What the fuck? How come this is not connected?

91
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:49,830
It's because I deleted the power plant. Well, it said there was no more fuel so I deleted it.

92
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,440
All right, I think it's time. I gotta make a new city. I gotta start over. I'm gonna make a new

93
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:09,769
city. I'm gonna make it better this time. Okay, we're doing it. I'm gonna make a new city. I'm

94
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:26,839
gonna be quick about it. This place is fucked. I'm doing another one. I'm gonna make a new one. I'm

95
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:42,519
gonna make it smaller and more manageable. We're gonna do this in... Wow, the snow. That'd be cool.

96
00:17:42,519 --> 00:18:02,890
Winter Hills. Snowy coast. Do Dust Bowl. Two rivers. The Dust Bowl. This is just green. It's

97
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,289
always Dust Bowl. No, I want to do Frosty Rivers. A nice little snow town. Yeah, Frosty Rivers is

98
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:25,619
the one. That's what I'm doing. Change the name? I will. Wingding City. I don't know. They all

99
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:53,240
started eating each other. We have a new city now. Snowy Crest. Here we go. Hello. Let's start. I

100
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,750
already know how to do this. Okay, so let's start with... This is the highway to come into the city.

101
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:08,339
We're gonna have a nice snowy crest. So this is coming in. Let's do... Where's the music, man? I

102
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:19,500
want some cool music. Rock City. All right. Oh, I can't do any of this shit because I have to level

103
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,140
up my city. All right, here we go. So when you come in, you make your way in here.

104
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:34,230
Then we're gonna have... You know what? Come all the way down here. We're gonna do a straight line

105
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,710
all the way. Can we out on this? Just wait. You'll see. There's gonna be just a big straight line.

106
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:52,410
Pause the game. Is that too long? Why? I was thinking about having it come this way and then...

107
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,730
I said you're gonna make it small. This is small. It's gonna be like this.

108
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:33,339
Here we go. Ready? What? What? What's so bad about that?

109
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:48,470
What? What's wrong with this? These are just little side streets. What's wrong with this?

110
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,849
Make angle. The angle. What's wrong? What's the matter with an angle?

111
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:22,420
Don't you slow the fuck down. Only do rectangles. Look, I'm fucking working on it.

112
00:21:22,420 --> 00:22:08,839
I'm gonna go a little further. Hold on. Go look at a Google's map street view thing and look down.

113
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:41,480
And this is what the shit looks like. Another one. Here we go. Houses. This is all houses.

114
00:22:42,119 --> 00:23:01,190
All of it. This is where the residential is. Over here. So now we have... Do we have any bigger

115
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,150
roads? Okay, so now this is like... We're gonna get out of... Okay, here's like the intersection

116
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,130
where we get the fuck out of here. And here we are. All right. This is how you get out of here.

117
00:23:10,779 --> 00:24:15,349
Wait, is this one way? And this is where like this shopping area will go. Go over here. He's

118
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:44,140
occupied. Okay. Christmas tree. Rib cage. I just want it to be efficient. I don't... I don't... I

119
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,049
don't... I don't... It's efficient because everybody's over here and everyone's over there.

120
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:18,359
And we go up here and all the industry is up here. Okay, good. Up here. Maybe some more commercial

121
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:33,220
buildings. Over here. And then put this up. How much do I got? 27,000. Here we go. Because this

122
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:40,859
is where the water is. This is where the water is. You have to explain it to everybody. Wait,

123
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:53,059
was it frozen? Highway traffic is going down residential. Oh, right. Fuck. I don't... Okay,

124
00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:33,109
so here's how we're gonna fix that. Now they don't have to go down residential. You can do

125
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:56,650
like a rotary. Just make it one way. Six lane, one way. Okay, there we go. There we are. There

126
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:11,349
we go. Okay. Now they've got a choice. You build utilities before you run into money. No money for

127
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:58,920
the infrastructure. I got money. I got money. Curved road. Okay. Because I wanted to be able

128
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:04,680
to sit on here from the water. Up curving roads and build a power plant. What's wrong with curving

129
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:34,230
roads? Well, looks like we're doing wind. Time for some wind farm. Up here. Is there a hill or

130
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,849
anything? Wait, I need, I need, I need wind. They gotta be over here. Like right here on the coast,

131
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:50,539
right? Eight. I need like eight, eight, eight, six, seven, six. This music isn't very good. Well,

132
00:28:51,259 --> 00:29:48,150
change the channel then. Okay, I don't even have money. How fucked am I? I can't even take out a

133
00:29:48,150 --> 00:30:13,430
loan. I spend too much money building this out. I forgot. I'm not soft locked yet. Not yet. All

134
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:28,569
right. For the free houses that are here, we're going to increase taxes. It's 200 bucks. I'll be

135
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:51,029
right. Okay. Now increase taxes. I can't increase taxes. Fuck. I can't believe I fucked this up.

136
00:30:51,029 --> 00:31:02,019
Okay. Can I refund all this shit up here? Why did this cost so much money? All right. All right.

137
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:10,809
Pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause. I don't even have a water pump. I'm okay. I'm, I was

138
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:15,609
building as if I was on the last city with like 50,000, a hundred thousand dollars. This is only

139
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:26,460
the second city I've ever made. Roads are expensive. I had like eight hours in the last city. We just

140
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,970
started a brand new city and I'm building as if I had the money from the last city. This is not the

141
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:45,339
third city. That doesn't count. The tutorial didn't count. All right. At least these people will be

142
00:31:45,339 --> 00:32:04,019
online. You can't live without that sweet, sweet, tall money. This is so expensive. I've got to do

143
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:32,779
it though. How much money do I have? This is so fucking expensive. Don't worry. It's salvageable.

144
00:32:32,779 --> 00:33:04,920
Hold on. Okay. We're going to start generating money, generating taxes. Why do they not have

145
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:24,200
electricity? Okay. Now, wait, they have to be heated because we're in the fucking goddamn

146
00:33:25,019 --> 00:34:07,900
winter wonderland. I fucked it up. Whatever. They use extra electricity. Okay. So now remember,

147
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:22,070
I don't have like $180,000. I need to build one street. A lot of water here. We're going small.

148
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,130
We're going small and manageable. We're going to start with a rotary. I can't even build a

149
00:34:27,130 --> 00:35:06,469
fucking rotary. God damn it. Okay. Very, very small. Connect the freeways together. Why did

150
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:22,099
somebody tell me to connect these together? Why? Yeah, somebody did say that. I was like, sure.

151
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:37,460
All right. I actually kind of like this. People come into the city. If they want to fucking,

152
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:52,500
they can what? Go like over fucking here. Connect it. This is confusing. No, they could like go like,

153
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,190
connect it like this. You know, fucking whatever. You go around in the goddamn.

154
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:10,760
You go around in the goddamn. This is fine because then I could just keep it going this way.

155
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:35,139
Truck stop town. They buy trees. I have to, I have to do this. Stop. Stop. No, no more.

156
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:41,420
Now we're going to make a small little area over here. Why couldn't I have used this from the very

157
00:36:41,420 --> 00:37:01,849
beginning? How come this is locked? I want it to be bigger. Wait. Oh no. I want it to be,

158
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:21,699
I want it to be one way. There we go. Okay. And then they come up and they take a left.

159
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:37,019
This is why you go bankrupt. This is another restart. No, it's not. It's making an off ramp.

160
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:46,019
Like I have, I can't, I have no options. Everything is, everything's okay. Now I can do this.

161
00:37:46,579 --> 00:38:00,409
Why is everything blacked out in the first? I don't understand. This was fine. That is fine.

162
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:09,219
Play with, why would I not have everything unlocked right now? Like, I don't understand.

163
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:13,699
I can't like make an off ramp because I have to do, I have to do a single lane road first before

164
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:42,489
anything else unlocks. How the fuck do I do this? Can I not do this? It's in the main menu. Well,

165
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:50,980
whatever. It's already open. It's cheap money. It needs to be in the mods menu. All right. Well,

166
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,619
whatever. We're going to, look, I'm going to, I'm going to keep going with this. So this is one way.

167
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:10,440
I'm going to make a roundabout up here. That's one way, right? It is now. Okay. Roundabout,

168
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:27,579
right here. Roundabout over here. Why roundabout here? Because I want to have people go around and

169
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:58,730
spin. Roundabout should connect both of the roads. Exactly. That's what I was going to do. Why can

170
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:15,739
I do this? Just do what you want. You know what? I'm going to go over here. I'm doing this. It's

171
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:44,789
going to be roundabout town. How do we get rid of these trees? Four lane road with parking spaces.

172
00:40:44,789 --> 00:41:04,579
That's not what I want. This is what I'm talking about. Like what this is. I don't, I'm not going

173
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:15,769
to get, I don't want to get overzealous here. Okay. There's going to be another roundabout

174
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:20,570
in the middle here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that'd be sick.

175
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:35,829
No, no, that's too many. Too many. Way too many. They can connect here if they want.

176
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:51,800
What do you mean if they want? I can't see shit with these trees.

177
00:41:52,840 --> 00:42:19,880
Okay. You're making crop circles. It'll be interesting. You'll see. All right. That's enough.

178
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:29,300
That's enough. It's two people holding hands and leaning back and putting their other hands out

179
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:42,469
in a dance number. $50 from phylactery lich. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. You know how you took

180
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:46,789
a pottery class for a joke? Maybe go ahead and take some city design classes. How would I ever

181
00:42:46,789 --> 00:43:01,699
do that? Play this video game that I've played for like six hours. I'm just making fucking roads.

182
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:07,699
Like guys, you, you, this is not your city that I'm making that you're going to live in tomorrow.

183
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:12,760
Like you don't, you don't have to live here. You don't have to live here tomorrow.

184
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:21,860
Like what the fuck? Oh, I don't want to live here. You don't have to. This is not real. This

185
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:30,809
is a pretend video game. This is make believe. I'm just kidding. I'm sucking you all up in a

186
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:35,130
fucking digital vacuum and you're going to be, you're going to live here tomorrow. Just trying

187
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:46,739
to make you have a little bit more false sense security for the next few hours. All right. Here

188
00:43:46,739 --> 00:44:03,780
we go. This is rotary side B. All right. Not too much. Hey, how many of you guys want to live on

189
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:18,659
B side? How many of you guys want to live on A side? Let's see. All right. Okay. The plumbing

190
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:59,260
here. Did it correct? Okay. I still have money. I'm good. Put all the garbage on the B side.

191
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:18,019
Okay. What about power? We need to do power now. Wait. Okay. I need to see where any resources are.

192
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:38,380
I'll just do it across the way here. This doesn't matter, right? Just do wind. A bunch of wind over

193
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:55,699
here. Wait, how do I, is it a bridge? Wait, it'll be a bridge. Huh? Hold on. Holy shit. Oh wow.

194
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:03,059
It makes a bridge. That's so cool. That's awesome. Nice. All right. Right in the middle. Right there.

195
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:34,230
Yeah. That's cool. $18,000. Kind of cheap for a bridge. Okay. No more. I need a small road.

196
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:50,760
I need power plant. I need some commercial buildings too. Um, where should they go? In the middle?

197
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:57,369
Yeah, that'd be nice. Look, take this out. It's like a little street, little what the commercial

198
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:02,280
shit is over here. Go like from here to here, right? No, but I don't want the traffic over

199
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:17,349
doing that. Click link, please. What is it? Twitch viewer integrator. This mod integrates

200
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,550
your Twitch viewers to your Cities Skylines game. It retrieves the current viewer list of your

201
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,750
channel when a game is started and loaded and stores them to an internal list of which the names

202
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:43,179
are generated. Uh, apparently, though there's three comments on this and I think it's only been,

203
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:51,610
it's only been downloaded like fucking 12 times. This is pretty sure something went wrong. How do

204
00:47:51,610 --> 00:48:14,650
I know this is working? I want to live there. Uh, Twitch integrator config, configure the mod. It's

205
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:26,090
built in a config key value mod based on functional. All right. Stream key stealer. No,

206
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:35,750
I'm hold on. We don't do this. There's literally not even any houses yet. Why did I build a fucking

207
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:44,780
$20,000 bridge? I need houses and money and power plants. All right, I'm ready. Here we go. We're

208
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:52,820
going to build some wind farm. Need some wind. No, no, that's too close. Eight. We go eight right

209
00:48:52,820 --> 00:49:02,760
here. Yeah. Eight. Is eight the max? I kind of want all the infrastructure to be over here.

210
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:19,699
No, I'd give me a power plant. 19,000 for a power plant. Just put it on the road. I'll fix this later.

211
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:28,150
Just need it on the road. It's going to be just like a light industry up here for now.

212
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:47,659
Light industry. And then of course, our plan. How could I forget? Go power plant plumbing.

213
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:59,420
It's going to go. How was this flow? What's this flow? What's this flow? Is it flow this way?

214
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:15,000
So we want the shit to be pumped over here. So this is the shit pump. All right. And then

215
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:35,139
here's the regular pump right here. Why is this doing this? This is fucked up. Mike, can I get

216
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:50,409
this on here? The shit pumps on the side. Well, that's, I've reached this. I hope so. Yes. There's

217
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:59,960
that. And then the shit pump. Okay. We're good. Now we just need electricity to come that way and

218
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:19,659
we're done. And I can get my town that's ready to fucking roll. Power's going to come down here.

219
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:45,380
We just need to wait for this shit to be actually built so I can do it. That first city. I'm already

220
00:51:45,380 --> 00:52:53,929
out of money. The water pump is out. It's because the fucking bridge. Why is all this shit locked up?

221
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:01,130
Okay. I did the tutorial yesterday and didn't have this problem like two or three times in a

222
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:20,599
row. What the fuck? Delete the fucking bridge. What? What? How did I lose money by refunding

223
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:36,650
the bridge? It doesn't refund? You didn't, what do you mean I didn't refund? That's how you do it.

224
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:49,860
It just says refund on it. What? It only refunds if no time has passed. Oh fuck. I didn't know that.

225
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:59,349
What's the cheat to give me like $20,000 right now? You can't refund a bridge.

226
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,010
What's the cheat just to fucking type it to give me $20,000? No. No. No. Save this.

227
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:13,079
I'm not going to be under the fucking locked bullshit in the first 10 minutes. I've already

228
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:33,449
done all this. I don't want like the single lane roads and you can only build this. Where is it?

229
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:47,739
Editor. Assets. Content warning. Content manager. Okay. Give me fucking like $50,000 right now.

230
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:04,409
This one. Custom assets. Wait. I can save this. Mods. Card mode. Unlimited money. Money never runs

231
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:19,820
out. Done. I'm only going to use it for like five minutes. Unlock all. Thank you. Okay. We're good?

232
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:35,260
That should be it, right? What do you mean no? That doesn't work? All mods are global. Activating

233
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:53,289
mod. Loading a SEGA mod. Yeah, we're fine. Let's go. Cheating is god tier. Well, I just don't want

234
00:55:53,289 --> 00:56:07,500
to sit here and unlock everything again. He's scared of creepers so he turned on creative mode.

235
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:27,210
Okay. Thank you. All right. Unlimited fucking money. Build the bridge again. Thank you. Power

236
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:45,349
on. Good. This is temporary. It's temporary just to get this shit to turn on. You in? It's not in.

237
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:10,599
Okay. All right. There we go. That's good. Commercial buildings. I want to do them right

238
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:17,849
in the middle. What do I want to do? Down with the stream. I'm going to turn it off in a second. I

239
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:25,699
just need to generate at least like a fucking dollar. Center the- I don't care. Here, look.

240
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:31,590
There'll be businesses here. That's cool. All right. Then you're going to have your own little

241
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:37,159
area over here and right in the middle. Check it out. Watch this. There we go. Medium roads.

242
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:46,360
Four lane road with bicycle lanes. I don't know. I don't want that. I just want a four lane road.

243
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:58,940
And what do I want to do with it? Leaders don't deserve respect. Okay. I want businesses here.

244
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:27,159
Kind of a broken neck, but that's fine. All right. More houses. No, there shouldn't be any houses in

245
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:48,010
here. No houses. Houses here. Around the edges. No houses in the middle. And then some more.

246
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:59,219
That's fine for now. Okay. Pause it. Connect this shit. Not connected, is it? It could be.

247
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:10,389
Electricity is going here. Good. All right. Now let me just generate some money.

248
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:23,030
And I'm going to turn off unlimited money. Why am I losing money with unlimited money on?

249
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:31,110
What are you guys doing? Wait, is this bullshit in chat about center the bridge or we're not

250
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:41,750
going to talk? Is that what this is? The center of the bridge or we're not talking? Why are you

251
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:54,789
guys not talking? Because you cheated. Get out of here. Whatever. This doesn't matter. Center the

252
00:59:54,789 --> 01:00:04,550
bridge. That's up in my brain right now, don't you think? Now, how are taxes? Increase a little bit

253
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:20,949
What? What are you? What are you? Oh shit. Nobody can breathe. Nobody can breathe up here.

254
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:42,059
They have electricity up there. All right. What's going on over here? Build these houses.

255
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:51,510
All right. Once I have, okay. Once I get to like a nice plus like thousand, turn it off. I'm going

256
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,150
to turn it off. I just want to get this plus thousand. I'm going to turn it off. I promise.

257
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,579
We need to make like a fucking hospital. Hospital going to be right in the fucking middle.

258
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:10,059
It'll hit every community. Look at that. Smart. And then we're going to have a

259
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:16,940
sauna. Oh, I can spend as much as I want. We're going to have a gym. Dude, I got a blank check.

260
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:23,059
How about a community pool? Oh wow. Right in the middle. Everybody gets a community pool

261
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:30,340
when you have a blank check. It's great. Look at this community pool. A community pool over here

262
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:37,500
too. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Only one community pool and then one

263
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:45,659
helicopter depot. No, I need a police station. All right. One police station. Police station.

264
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:50,199
Hospital. Police station. All right. And now, all right. Okay. All right. Now I'm out of here.

265
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:54,599
I'm done. A fire station too. Just for free. All right. All right. I'm up. Look at that negative

266
01:01:54,599 --> 01:02:05,820
money. I don't like that. I don't like that. Why am I getting negative money? And let me do

267
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:29,000
school too. Elementary school. And then just one high school. I'm ready. Wait, is the pool

268
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:38,920
costing money? Holy shit. Wait, what? Why is the community pool costing so much money?

269
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:44,199
Okay. Get rid of the community pool. Get rid of the community pool. We don't need it.

270
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:56,739
What do you mean stop these fires? What the fuck are you talking about? You're not supposed to

271
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:15,260
have the community pool yet. Yeah. It's okay. We're going. Let's extend this out. Let's put

272
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:19,179
this neighborhood out. Um, hold on. People are going to freak the fuck out when I do this. I

273
01:03:19,179 --> 01:03:38,090
know they are. No curved roads. I'm going to do a curved road. I like them. Oh shit. I can't. Yes,

274
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:54,409
I can. No, that's cheating. That's actually cheating. No, I just need a baseline. That's it.

275
01:03:55,289 --> 01:04:18,119
All right. It kind of looks like a moth. It's all right. Okay. All right. All right. More

276
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:23,139
residential. I'm going to do big houses over here. I'm not supposed to have these yet.

277
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:59,960
Stop. Stop. This is cool. This is cool. All right. Speed up. I need to put. All right. I'm done.

278
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:09,219
Time to put the, uh, I'm going to wait for the community to grow a little bit and I need and

279
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:13,590
then I'm going to actually turn off this all the cheating. I promise there will be no more cheating

280
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:29,480
after this. I promise. I won't cheat anymore. I promise. Oh, we're doing electricity. I need

281
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:35,829
more than this. I'm going to need to put some shit up here. How many M how many M M M's is this?

282
01:05:35,829 --> 01:06:01,099
Whatever it is. Eight. Okay. We can do some here. Okay. That's good. Fine. That's that's enough.

283
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:07,269
That's all I'm done. Oh, we need trash. I'm going to get that done real quick.

284
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:13,480
We're just a second here. We need to dump. Dump will be, um, down here. Check this out.

285
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:22,579
Oh, we got to have a place for the dump. Six lane roads for the dump trucks. They can come this way.

286
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,449
Um, dump truck. Dump truck. Where's the dump trucks go? Where's the dump go? Where's the dump go?

287
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:43,019
Where's the dump go? Dump over here. Um, where's the dump go? It's got to go on the right side.

288
01:06:43,579 --> 01:07:28,679
What happened? What happened? Okay. All right. That's it. Plenty of room for them to go.

289
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:48,889
It's not symmetrical. I can fix it. Don't worry. There we go. Hey, look at that. Our town is looking

290
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:55,139
a good start. It's a good start. Now we just fast forward until I can collect enough taxes to not

291
01:07:55,139 --> 01:08:07,300
be in the red. And then I turn off the cheating. I can't fucking believe that shit. God damn it.

292
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:42,779
All right. I'm in the green. It's time to cheat. Time to stop cheating. Content manager. All right.

293
01:08:43,510 --> 01:09:06,840
Mods. Unlimited money off. Okay. Unlock all off. I can't turn unlock all off. I already have stuff

294
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:16,810
that I'm not supposed to have. I'm not, this stuff that I'm not supposed to, I don't want that.

295
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:30,329
I'm keeping it on. Another 50 fucking dollars came in. You guys, why are you guys giving me so much

296
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:38,090
money? This is insane. This is like $500. Goiki, another 50 bucks. If the bridge isn't centered

297
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:49,220
in an hour, I'll, oh my God. If the bridge isn't centered in an hour, I'll blow up the hospital.

298
01:09:49,220 --> 01:10:12,890
Joker. What's going on? Why do I have this much money? That's too much money. How do I get donated?

299
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,039
Look, I have an idea. You, I have an idea. Don't worry. You want, here's the idea. You ready?

300
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:37,510
I have an idea. Just make a bunch of expensive shit and then delete them. Here. I'll put like five

301
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:48,300
statues. Oh yeah. Our town has a Statue of Liberty. Oh yeah. So does ours. We got one too. Oh,

302
01:10:48,300 --> 01:11:09,770
wait. No, we have, we've got the Sherp X launch site over on our side. Wait, who's cooler? Wait,

303
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:25,260
this is a spaceship? Okay. Now just wait and I'll just delete them. Why am I losing money? I

304
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:32,550
shouldn't be losing weekly money. Wait, these take so long. Okay. When can I delete it? Delete it so

305
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:39,050
I don't have to, I want to, don't want to refund 150. Delete it. Launch something. Launch. I don't

306
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:54,810
have a rocket. Pass launch operations. Launch preparation. Wait, launch a nuke at the other

307
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,659
town. Okay. I have to get rid of this. I'm going to fucking, this whole thing's going to get fucked

308
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:16,060
up. Build the rocket. I don't have any money guys. This is like end game money. Default windows,

309
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:39,689
fucking color selector. I have to, oh, sorry. Okay. I'm going to have to live with the money.

310
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:45,880
All right. I'm going to, here's how I do this. Just, okay. I'm going to, I could delete this too.

311
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:52,090
Here's how I'm going to fix this. Okay. So everyone's going to live tax free for like a year

312
01:12:52,090 --> 01:13:16,539
and then I'll be back to normal. No taxes for a fucking year. There. Now build. Put a couple

313
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:27,699
of the stores here. Uh, I want to put, yeah, I gotta do this again. All right. Good. Okay. Good.

314
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:34,020
Let's make some more industry. I need it. More industry. I'll pick up these roads. We need some

315
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:59,500
bigger roads here. That's too big. Uh, four lane road is fine. Just make a square over here. Okay.

316
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:14,260
Industry. Use your limitless wealth to center the bridge, you. What the fuck are you saying?

317
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:26,380
Report that a devastating meteor strike the city in the near future. Residents should seek shelter

318
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:43,449
immediately. If any is available. If it lands over here, I'm going to laugh my ass off beside

319
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:53,829
forever. Why? Oh my God. It's actually going to land up there. Okay. That's so fucking unfair.

320
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:59,430
A meteor strike has occurred. Avoid the impact site and head to shelter. If any is available.

321
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:24,970
What am I supposed to do now? Did you just turn off the game? Why do I feel like one of you guys

322
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:30,869
did that? Like I downloaded the Twitch integrator and somebody hated this layout so much.

323
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:35,750
Fucking double rotary thing is a stupid bridge in the middle. He wasted so much money. He's a

324
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:45,189
cheater. Nuke it. Wait, this fires. I need a fire door. Where's my fire department? Of course I've

325
01:15:45,189 --> 01:16:10,920
picked the level with all the trees. Fix the bridge. There. I fixed the bridge for you.

326
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:38,170
Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department.

327
01:16:39,159 --> 01:17:04,939
Go. Go. Get out there and do something. Go. It's spreading. Oh shit. Wait, why do we need

328
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:11,930
electricity for the fire engines to run? Sorry, boss. We can't go find those fires. There's no

329
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:29,000
electricity in our gasoline using trucks. What? Excuse me. Um, how did this happen?

330
01:17:55,659 --> 01:18:18,279
I'm going to make two squares. One square on the right, one square on the left and a small power

331
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:42,489
plant right there. So we're going to build this town over here. B side. Turn cheats off.

332
01:18:43,859 --> 01:20:48,460
Left square gang. Cheats are on. I think I can use this. Not one way. Fuck. That way? Okay.

333
01:20:48,460 --> 01:21:00,039
It's going to be a dead end road. I don't fucking care. What happened here? Uh, all right. We can

334
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:23,939
fix this. Just clean this up a little bit. I want this to be one way. Like if you're going to go

335
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:28,329
this way, I don't want, I want it to be one way this way. I don't want this. Like this doesn't

336
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:56,869
make any sense. No. What? I want to go this way. One way. Where's one way? Highway. There's no escape.

337
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:08,420
Six lane, one way road. One way. So I can't make it go the other way. Oh, if you right click. Okay.

338
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:23,609
That's fine. This is good. Why ask if you're not going to, if you're not going to read chat?

339
01:22:23,609 --> 01:22:26,329
I am reading chat. What do you think? How do you think I'm seeing everything you're saying?

340
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:34,520
Okay. Then this goes down. This is all right. I don't hate this. You can fix this part.

341
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:47,369
Feel like a fucking school over here.

342
01:22:53,300 --> 01:23:02,579
You must have not given a fuck. It's going to be a neighborhood.

343
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:45,159
The fridge is not even physically possible. Well, it, it is now. Somebody said this is

344
01:23:45,159 --> 01:24:04,220
a Mario Kart track. Pause it. Okay. I mean, this is not horrible, but this does, this has to go.

345
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:19,239
Maybe this could come over here. This wouldn't be insanely terrible if it did like this.

346
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:25,000
And it's just houses, just homes, maybe a couple more that come off of it.

347
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:37,270
Uh, actually I want this.

348
01:24:39,750 --> 01:25:09,800
I don't want to connect it. I want it to be a dead end. I'm making the J.

349
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:15,800
This is okay. This is just the J if somebody dropped a fucking boulder on his head.

350
01:25:15,800 --> 01:26:03,050
This is too harsh. Too harsh. Less harsh. Make it less harsh.

351
01:26:05,689 --> 01:26:40,779
I'll keep that as whatever. Okay. Small houses here. A couple of large houses here. This is too

352
01:26:40,779 --> 01:27:30,779
harsh. Fix it. Just make a football. You have the laces already. That's shit. One way fix this.

353
01:27:30,779 --> 01:28:09,020
This shit's one way. I want to like have this go out. This is like too fucked up. It's got to go

354
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:18,380
like that. And then this has to go over here. This is just too fucked up. One way. Uh, let's do

355
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:24,020
four lane road, but I want it to be one way. I know. Can I only, can you only do one way roads

356
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:57,050
with six lanes? The roundabout. How far out do I want to do this? Far enough where I can

357
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:53,770
move this out of the way. Clown town. Why is this a two way? Where? Why is this a two way?

358
01:29:53,770 --> 01:30:00,359
Because if you drive down this road, if you live here, you'll have to all, you, you, this is how

359
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:10,520
you get into town. Look, I'm just trying to salvage the fucking mess that I made. Otherwise you're

360
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:24,949
stuck here forever. If you live here, this, you can never turn left. Like you can't turn left here

361
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:30,500
ever. Unless I get rid of, this is one way to get to the highway. This is just for highway only.

362
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:39,449
Uh, this isn't straight. I know. I know. I know. I know. But what do you want me to do?

363
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:51,609
Now this is, uh, okay. God, no way. I can't even play this. I can't even do this.

364
01:30:51,609 --> 01:31:06,579
I have to delete everything from here on out. No, no, I can't. I can't.

365
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:20,500
Why did I have to get a bomb dropped on that town? It was starting to be fine.

366
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:34,890
I was going to start building out. This is fine. I'll keep that. But this shit's gotta go. This

367
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:53,350
has got to be changed because I cheated. Well, whatever. Okay. This is the houses. We're going

368
01:31:53,350 --> 01:32:00,329
to build houses here. I'm going to have big houses here and then we'll have an area where you can go.

369
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:07,939
You can go this way if you want. We'll connect these two. So now you can like get access to the

370
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:27,220
fucking wacky bridges. More houses over here. This will be the commercial center. This will be where

371
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:32,729
we do all the... No, this would be industrial. No, fuck that. There's no way this will work out.

372
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:37,850
This has to be industrial. This has to be residential. Industrial, residential, commercial,

373
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:51,699
residential. Good game. Okay. Cool. Good. This can be a straight line. Why can't I make a straight

374
01:32:51,699 --> 01:33:18,859
line? It's too big? Dude, how do you just make a one-way road that's four lanes? Six lanes.

375
01:33:19,579 --> 01:33:33,350
Six lane, one way. Six lane, one way. Is there four lane, one way? Can you only make a single

376
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:49,750
lane? A two lane, one way? That's not enough traffic. Highway can do it. Highway with sound

377
01:33:49,750 --> 01:34:13,560
barrier. Highway. A three lane, one way road. Okay. Yeah. Now we're going to change this. We'll change

378
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:31,670
this out to four lanes as of here. A little bit further out. Now you can either go over this way

379
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:46,380
or you could go this way. Wow. You have so many options. But you can't... Hold on. You can't get

380
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:57,590
in here from there. When did I switch to this? When I ran out of stuff to do an animal crossing

381
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:07,180
because I have to... A full day has to go by before I can do anything else. This has to connect down

382
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:26,380
here. It's so far away though. Yeah. I'm killing this. This is so fucked up. It would take me like

383
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:36,090
six hours of gameplay to get up here. This is impossible. Putting a rotary right here.

384
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:54,380
Should've done that down here. Drive all the way down here to get to the rotary that's right here.

385
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:40,310
That's so funny. I like that actually a lot. That's so stupid. Okay. These are small houses.

386
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:55,060
Large houses. How much money do I have? I'm good. Is football street gone? Yes. Because if I can't

387
01:36:55,060 --> 01:37:02,579
connect it... This is so huge. Look at how fucking enormous these are. This is like three miles.

388
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:21,979
Then commercial. Low density commercial right here. Maybe a few little pop-up shops right here.

389
01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:31,460
Commercial here. Commercial here. Commercial all over here. All commercial. Commercial. Looks all

390
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:44,069
like a little fun zone. Industry over here. Industry over here. And now we have our original first

391
01:37:44,069 --> 01:37:57,100
layout of our S... I don't know. Shit. I don't know why anyone would go over here, but we're

392
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:10,460
gonna have to figure it out later. In fact, there's absolutely no purpose. This is funny,

393
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:19,579
though. I like that it's a comedy bridge show. We're gonna keep it. All right. Now, power and

394
01:38:19,579 --> 01:38:33,609
plumbing. And then I'm able to at least spend two minutes in my fucking town that I built without

395
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:56,779
a meteor hitting it. Okay. And then we need over here. Pump will be right there. Make sure I have

396
01:38:56,779 --> 01:39:38,199
enough room for it. Whoa. All right. Cool. Electricity. I need water pumps. I actually

397
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:42,520
need to have the pump... Wait. Where's it going? This way? Down this way. So I have to have the

398
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:56,710
shit over here. Over here. And then the actual water pump over here. But wait. Why is this not

399
01:39:56,710 --> 01:40:18,869
taking water? Is it not in? Not... Wait. Hold on. Is it not in there? That's in there, right? Is this

400
01:40:18,869 --> 01:40:45,670
one in there? No, it's just the drain pipe. Okay. Let's go. Connected to anything. Don't matter.

401
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:56,220
Connected to anything. Don't matter. All right. Wake up. Electricity time. I know it's for free,

402
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:03,880
but people are gonna get really mad at me. Oil. There's no oil on this whole map. We're gonna do

403
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:12,380
coal. We're gonna do coal and wind. And the industry section over here. All right. And wind.

404
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:38,069
Water wind. Because that's better. Okay. Why did that happen? So what do you guys want to do

405
01:41:38,069 --> 01:41:53,560
tomorrow? What do you guys want to do tomorrow? What's the plan tomorrow? I should have started

406
01:41:53,560 --> 01:42:09,210
getting built up before I do this. Somebody just say Dark Souls 2. All right. Come on. Let's go.

407
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:29,739
I'm not gonna play Dark Souls 2 tomorrow. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Here we go. Connect this

408
01:42:29,739 --> 01:42:43,510
to here. And then connect this temporarily over here. Temporarily over here. It's just temporary.

409
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:48,149
Until everything gets built. Is your electricity being used? Here we go. Here are the houses.

410
01:42:49,800 --> 01:43:06,699
Nice. Power is coming in. No. It's not connected. Like, is it in? Are you in? Like, what the fuck

411
01:43:06,699 --> 01:43:12,279
are you doing? Consult the list? Yeah, there is a pretty significant list of stuff to do.

412
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:24,630
These are not connected. Temporarily do it. All right. Hey, look at that. Our town makes even

413
01:43:25,189 --> 01:43:52,840
a ten percent sense. Our car is not coming in. Nobody wants to live in Clown Town. Hey, rent is

414
01:43:52,840 --> 01:44:05,800
fucking pretty cheap in Clown Town. All right. Build up. Let's go. Build it up. Wear a helmet.

415
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:21,210
Like, this bridge. Oh, not bridge. Use this thing. Okay. Now we just wait for our city to build up.

416
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:35,659
What about? Oh, no schools. All right. Schools. Schools. Schools. Where should the hospitals be?

417
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:44,039
Elementary school. Okay, right. Somewhere in here. A lot of children to teach.

418
01:44:46,539 --> 01:44:55,590
And we'll do one over here, too. Over on the corner. Well, right here. And then a high school.

419
01:44:56,149 --> 01:45:11,899
High school reaching into here. It's just somebody's house. Whatever. I just don't think

420
01:45:11,899 --> 01:45:19,939
your direct neighbor is a fucking high school. You can like mow in your lawn and there's just

421
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:38,680
kids out there going to class. Okay. That's normal in real life. Well, no, not like high

422
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:43,640
schools usually in their own little areas and their own little campuses. If you live

423
01:45:44,439 --> 01:45:50,840
on Heather Jackson Street and your neighbor is a high school and the neighbor next to that.

424
01:45:51,479 --> 01:46:13,220
I mean, no. No high school was literally like that. There are houses across the street from high

425
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:20,550
schools. There's a high school literally across the street. I can hit it with a slingshot.

426
01:46:21,029 --> 01:46:35,500
Well, don't do that. He went to a ritzy high school. He's so coddled. It's a spoil. He went

427
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:40,869
to a high school with like a cafeteria McDonald's. There was a Wendy's in his high school, too. Did

428
01:46:40,869 --> 01:46:55,800
you know that? Oh, this motherfucker here. He was homeschooled. Yeah, cry to your butler.

429
01:46:58,149 --> 01:47:04,390
No, I did not. All right. I'm going to defend myself here. I did not go to a fucking school

430
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:10,140
like that. I went to a fucking public school and that public school that had fucking those

431
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:15,180
little shitty milks that nobody liked. I know those little cups of juice that were always icy.

432
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,460
The ice was they were fucking frosty and they weren't even juice. It was like slushy.

433
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:31,420
I would I know that shit. There was I didn't have any of that. Those gross cups. Don't talk to me

434
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:35,850
like you think. I like I don't know what I'm talking about. Just because my school happened

435
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:50,470
to be set back in a larger driveway. Sorry. I did I did not go to a private school. What the fuck?

436
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:59,819
What even you do? Who cares? I did not go to a private school. I went to a public fucking school.

437
01:48:04,279 --> 01:48:13,210
Homeschooling is private. Fucking guys. You brought your own lunch to school? No, I got to I've

438
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:19,380
I've got the fucking steak homes. That weird mystery meat with cheese on it that they put

439
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:23,060
in a sub role and gave it to you. I ate that like fucking two days a week, three days a week.

440
01:48:23,619 --> 01:48:33,579
There was like these these gross meatball subs you could get every day or like the like fucking

441
01:48:34,779 --> 01:48:41,449
90 cent steak of sandwich thing. He got steak. No, you don't understand.

442
01:48:49,210 --> 01:49:04,100
Surf and turf school lunch. Oh, it's not true. Now you guys are making me hungry. Catered lunch.

443
01:49:04,819 --> 01:49:09,380
Yeah, that's what a lunch is. It's fucking catered. The lunch ladies cater your

444
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:23,739
school with their expertise. And I don't know, why is nothing being built up here?

445
01:49:23,739 --> 01:49:55,109
Yeah, it's a fucking crazy billionaire child. No, this is working out pretty well. I'm fucking

446
01:49:55,109 --> 01:50:03,029
hungry now. All this talk about expensive lunches has made me want to go eat a lunch at 10 o'clock

447
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:20,760
at night. I got a lot I got some stuff in the fridge. What is this? Don't make him hungry.

448
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:35,029
He'll leave. Why did you make this? Why did you make this? Why can I even show this on stream?

449
01:50:35,029 --> 01:51:07,460
I love the little smile that you gave me at the end there. Look at the smile.

450
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:19,189
See that? I caught that. All right. Imagine exporting that and being like, yeah, that looks

451
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:27,000
good. This streamer getting toilet water shot in his fucking mouth. Yeah, render. You have to watch

452
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:40,779
every frame of that as it renders. That's pretty good. Oh, that's fucking disgusting.

453
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:52,140
Not using a render farm. Omega lull. Oh, we've got activity. We've got activity.

454
01:51:52,140 --> 01:52:06,140
Okay, what do I want to know? Finally, people are coming in. All right, now we need to buy like a

455
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:26,229
park. About here. Playground. Park with trees. This would be cool. Right here. Double park.

456
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:44,020
This is Park Avenue. Here. Parkway. Six lane road is the name. No. Parkway. Froggy street. All right.

457
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:57,930
How about um, we need like a police department here and then we need a uh a prison off the highway.

458
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:27,449
How about another prison? Two prisons back to back. I see power and shit. What the fuck just

459
01:53:27,449 --> 01:53:50,229
happened? Hey, how many people are in prison? Zero. I don't think that's gonna fill up very much. I

460
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:58,420
need a uh, yeah, we need um, fire fighters. Right here. How far do they go? Uh, put them over here.

461
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:08,539
That's better. And then a hospital. Hospital can go here. It'd be, all right, right here. Hospital way.

462
01:54:08,539 --> 01:54:27,100
Okay, good. Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. What's costing so much money?

463
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:37,739
Money? You're right. Wait, taxes at zero? How much is it? Prison's 2400 bucks a week?

464
01:54:37,739 --> 01:55:01,529
Okay, uh, that's way too expensive. By local ordinance, I decree that we will remove every prison

465
01:55:01,529 --> 01:55:11,770
and every hospital in our city. Good luck motherfuckers. Of course they're not gonna like

466
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:26,949
that. What's still costing? 5600 bucks a week. Where's my spreadsheet? Where's the spreadsheet?

467
01:55:26,949 --> 01:55:39,159
The budget? The fuck is taking so much money? Weekly police department expenses. What? What are

468
01:55:39,159 --> 01:55:55,989
you talking about? This game is so fun. Now I imagine a world where you're not a total fucking

469
01:55:55,989 --> 01:56:08,579
idiot and can make interesting cities and towns and stuff. I'm not a right-brained person at all.

470
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:15,029
In fact, if you were to take a probably a brain scan of my brain, the middle part with like the

471
01:56:15,029 --> 01:56:19,670
left and right of your brain, you know, you get the two, the two hemispheres, left brain, right brain.

472
01:56:20,939 --> 01:56:28,619
I would probably, the line in the middle would be as, it would be like one slice of cheese length

473
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:37,500
of the right brain. All of it, the rest of it would be left brain. It would be like one craft

474
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:45,460
singles thickness of how much I have for right brain. Right brain is, wait, is that the other

475
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:52,739
way around? Which is the one that's like your big math and and like log, logistics and logic and

476
01:56:52,739 --> 01:57:08,539
shit. That's, is that right or left? That's left. Cheese brain. That proves, that proves your right

477
01:57:08,539 --> 01:57:18,300
brain. What? Hold on. Right brain or left brain? I actually want to know. What's the difference?

478
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:29,130
Left brain versus right brain. Okay. All right. Left brain is like math and, and hold on. Right

479
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:34,489
brain is expression, emotional intelligence, and imagination. Left brain is language, numbers,

480
01:57:34,489 --> 01:57:43,430
and analytical thinking. I'm right-brained motherfuckers. Here are my, my, my emotion.

481
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:50,890
I'm an incredibly emotional person and I've, I can, I've, I can make up fucking animals in my head.

482
01:57:51,449 --> 01:57:59,939
How about this one? A dwarf. That's a giraffe and a hippopotamus together. Could you do that?

483
01:58:12,649 --> 01:58:27,699
Right Twix. Right Twix streamer. That's fucking hilarious. Okay. How are we doing over here?

484
01:58:27,699 --> 01:58:34,359
Got the parks. It's still minus a thousand dollars a day. I'm a psych major. That's a myth,

485
01:58:34,359 --> 01:58:49,859
Jerma. Will you let me have this? All right. I need a garbage place. We need two garbage places.

486
01:58:50,739 --> 01:59:00,819
But what's going on with the, whoa. What's going on with the water? What's going on with the water?

487
01:59:00,819 --> 01:59:21,220
Why is this happening? What is this? What's going on? Why? What is that? This doesn't make any sense.

488
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:33,479
That's something's landing here. Okay, dude. There's, I don't know what that's supposed to mean,

489
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:45,899
but whatever. He parted the seas. We will make it across the Moses river. Follow me.

490
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:03,590
What else can I do? This town sucks. I like, I like the A side and B side town way better.

491
02:00:04,710 --> 02:00:12,119
Holy shit. Look at this person. This person's got a little droid. First electric transport ride.

492
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:24,310
What the fuck? Look at this thing. That's too bad. A side and B side got hit with a meteor.

493
02:00:28,619 --> 02:00:49,479
I need to spruce this up a little. BB unit. Okay. Let's speed up time. Time for an expansion here.

494
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:55,399
Expansion is going to go out. We've got some commercial buildings. Industry is going over

495
02:00:55,399 --> 02:01:01,159
here. I want to go out this way. Bang. More residential and then more commercial. No,

496
02:01:01,159 --> 02:01:25,050
more residential, more commercial. Check this out. Don't hold your breath. This is a one way.

497
02:01:25,050 --> 02:02:07,050
Okay. More houses. This is going to wrap around into a mall. Commercial everywhere down here.

498
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:37,800
Mall. Does this make sense right here? Super commercial. All right. We need more industry

499
02:02:37,800 --> 02:03:07,420
after this. Good. Cool. We need power and fluids. We are connected already. Now that's going to come

500
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:22,229
out here for something. Industry. More of it. We can go this way with this. All industry out here.

501
02:03:27,270 --> 02:04:00,579
Factories. Build a dam. You can build a dam. Oil industry. Where's water? How do I build a dam?

502
02:04:00,579 --> 02:04:10,649
Unique factories. Warehouses. Oil. Barracks. Boar. Dam. Farm building. Whoa. There's so much

503
02:04:10,649 --> 02:04:29,460
cool shit in this game. Milking parlor. Where's the dam? Pumping service. Eco water treatment plant.

504
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:45,979
Where is it? Under power? Geothermal power plant. Ocean thermal energy conversion.

505
02:04:46,789 --> 02:04:53,420
Hydro power plant. Oh shit. Okay. Where should I put this? Where the water flows?

506
02:04:55,829 --> 02:05:17,750
Like here. How much production? How does this work? It didn't do anything.

507
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:39,029
Is it not long enough? I need to connect roads to it. Is that why this is happening?

508
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:47,750
I need to connect. It's facing the wrong way. Oh, it's backwards. I can refine it, right?

509
02:05:55,029 --> 02:06:19,319
It's backwards. What do you mean it's backwards? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh, it's just barely

510
02:06:19,319 --> 02:06:25,189
touching the bottom. Everything's fine. It's just everything's fine. That's why those legs are there.

511
02:06:25,909 --> 02:06:37,670
It's not going to come all the way down, right? Do not wipe out the bridge. Do not wipe out the

512
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:45,899
bridge. So what am I doing wrong here? We're fine. It's all right. These are businesses. There's

513
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:54,789
nothing here. It's just road. It'll dry. Oh, it's right at the lip. Put up a flood wall.

514
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:15,340
Okay. It's, it's fine. Power is disconnected. What? Oh, no. What? No, I'm trying to connect up.

515
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:48,250
I understand. That's what you have to do. It has to be big. It has to be connected to the wall.

516
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:08,340
I don't turn it around. I can't, you can't turn the fucking thing around. What? What do you mean

517
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:15,130
turn it around? I paint it. I, how do I turn it around here? I paint it. How do you, I can't

518
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:26,920
turn it around. You're talking about a seat. Look what I'm talking about. You guys, what are you

519
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:35,020
talking about? All right. I'm going to try this again. Don't listen to chat. It needs to be

520
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:43,619
downstream. Isn't that what this is? This is downstream. So what's, what's wrong with it?

521
02:08:43,619 --> 02:08:53,739
Why is it, you have to build the land up. I wanted to go the other way. That's okay. Don't

522
02:08:53,739 --> 02:09:28,569
fucking ruin this up. Scoop it back in. Scoop it back in. Not enough soil. Okay. Too steep.

523
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:57,399
Fucking hundred thousand dollars. I don't care. I'm almost out of money. This is connected already.

524
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:16,600
Somebody died at the dump. Who died at the dump? A dead person is praying. Somebody dumped a dead

525
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:34,069
body at the dump. That's so stupid. This is insane. I have to drive to the next city for

526
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:41,260
a painkiller prescription or pay big bucks. Wait, where's the hospital? Where's the doctor's office?

527
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:57,000
Oh, there is none. Introducing the doctor's office. All right. Is there anything going

528
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,720
up here? The commercial and the houses. We need people to be smarter. I need an education building.

529
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:07,770
I need a high school. Is there, there already is a high school here. There's a fucking high

530
02:11:07,770 --> 02:11:16,340
school already. Why are they not educated? Public library. We'll do a public library.

531
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:28,739
I need college. College is too expensive. All right. Public library. It's not hitting enough

532
02:11:28,739 --> 02:11:48,090
people. Public bugleberry. Warning. Experts predict an earthquake could hit the area soon.

533
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:58,279
I've gotten more random natural disasters in the last hour and a half playing this game. Just

534
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:03,319
dicking around just after playing Animal Crossing than I did in almost seven and a half hours straight

535
02:12:03,319 --> 02:12:15,979
in the same map last night. Why not turn off? Oh, it's good. It's good. It's good. It's not

536
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:22,869
gonna hit anything. An earthquake is occurring. Don't panic and wait for help if you are in the

537
02:12:22,869 --> 02:13:43,210
affected area. All right, we're fine. No, it's gonna go. We're okay. There was only one tube got

538
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:48,409
disconnected. Oh no, there's an earthquake. Everyone lost plumbing. No, it's okay. Like,

539
02:13:48,409 --> 02:14:20,539
attach the end here is the only thing that happened. No, power. Okay, that should be fine,

540
02:14:20,539 --> 02:14:36,090
right? We lost the comedy bridge. A little dead person to dump. I know. I know. And it's sad. We

541
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:56,250
lost the comedy bridge. Okay. It's a radio station I haven't listened to. Why is this one? I don't

542
02:14:56,250 --> 02:15:16,539
understand why this one is a copyright claim. Building is flooding. Oh, it's still wet.

543
02:15:21,539 --> 02:15:25,479
All right. Industry is going to go up there eventually. Let's build more residential over

544
02:15:25,479 --> 02:15:38,539
here. I need it from here. We're gonna do a single road out and then down and then out

545
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:46,949
up and then take a look at this. It's simple, simple, simple squares, simple squares,

546
02:15:48,979 --> 02:15:57,659
simple square. That's how is that? That's not a 90 degree angle. I don't care.

547
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:20,840
And these are going to be just small houses. Relaxation station. Okay, plumbing here.

548
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:38,260
Are we hitting everything? Yep. Yes, we are. Yep. How's everything over here? Good. Electric.

549
02:16:38,899 --> 02:16:48,309
How much electricity am I pumping? 107. Bring me those houses. Bring them to me.

550
02:16:50,090 --> 02:17:06,149
Delete these broken things that are attacked by the earthquake. Okay. Act normal. Get a cemetery.

551
02:17:06,149 --> 02:17:23,430
What does the cemetery look like? Monument. Where is it? Medical. There it is. All right,

552
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:47,719
we got a cemetery now. We do have a hospital, right? Did he not like animal crossing? No,

553
02:17:47,719 --> 02:17:53,430
I did. Just like ran out of stuff to do and I didn't want to just fast forward time over and

554
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:58,780
over again. I wanted to play it kind of every day. I decided that was going to be the thing I do at

555
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:04,739
the end of streams now is just do chores and animal crossing and go for bits. It was really

556
02:18:04,739 --> 02:18:16,360
fun though. I like it. Are we playing it more? Build this up. This is, I'm counting on this.

557
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:26,250
Oh, another park. Jumpy house? No, something cool. What's this? Floating cafe.

558
02:18:27,700 --> 02:19:01,459
Floating island? Put it over here. Nice. Does this cost money? How do I get this to...

559
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:34,520
I don't get it. Wait, is it a walking path? How do you make a walking path? It's got

560
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:39,700
multiple problems. No road acts. Make sure cars and pedestrians can reach the entrance.

561
02:19:43,030 --> 02:19:59,770
Um, okay. Square packages. The packaging specialists are proud to present

562
02:20:02,329 --> 02:20:07,530
the untold story of the invention of the box and the family rivalry that nearly destroyed

563
02:20:07,530 --> 02:20:21,579
going from over here about opening your acceptance packaging. Whatever. Oh, that's so ugly.

564
02:20:26,889 --> 02:20:33,659
All right. How do you use this thing? All right, here they come.

565
02:20:36,059 --> 02:20:49,700
Vacation finally. I should do like 10 of these. No matter what stage of life. Oh, I'm out of money.

566
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:53,780
Okay, I have no money. Do a cafe too.

567
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:03,260
Floating cafe. Floating island. I don't have enough money for a floating cafe.

568
02:21:06,059 --> 02:21:11,260
I do know. It literally means fried noodles. I took too much money.

569
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:39,540
Floating cafe. Wait, what? Wait, can I put it on top? Nice. Oh, cool, man.

570
02:21:41,819 --> 02:22:07,750
Cool, man. Nice. I'll give them like a walking path. Why does this hurt my finger bones? Is this

571
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:17,909
hurting anybody else's bones? Just hearing this? Just looking at this? All right, so this is ready

572
02:22:17,909 --> 02:23:10,649
to go. It is, right? These are ready. All right, we need some customers. Oh, I need a path. The

573
02:23:10,649 --> 02:23:44,420
amusement park path. Okay. Amusement park path. That doesn't count as a path? Oh, all right. Now

574
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:58,729
we're going to do what we got. What's this? Park plaza? No, no, no. Cafe. Souvenir shop.

575
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:24,549
Rotating teacups. Perfect. Is that a park area? Isn't that expand the park area? Park area overview.

576
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:43,750
Zone it. It's own zone. Office zone. D zone. Is it the district? Is that district? City planning?

577
02:24:43,750 --> 02:24:53,979
No. Where's the district? Cool. The zone. District scenarios. Okay. I want this to be an amusement

578
02:24:53,979 --> 02:25:16,840
park. Campus. Commercial. What was it? Pleasure. Office. IT. Self-sufficient building. Is it creepy

579
02:25:16,840 --> 02:26:08,889
mask? Tourism? Does it be tourism? Parks. Paint park area? Wrong. Almost. You have to expand out

580
02:26:08,889 --> 02:27:21,530
of the existing area. What the fuck? Okay. The Myrtle experience. Okay, cool. Let's go.

581
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:28,579
Let's make our amusement park path. All right. We're going to go to the entrance is in a really

582
02:27:28,579 --> 02:27:39,459
fucking weird place, but that's fine. Here's it. Ride road. And then here's cafe centers.

583
02:27:41,780 --> 02:28:00,870
Rides over here. Trying to curve off. Okay. And then maybe one more down here and we'll

584
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:10,860
start from here. Can I make a roller coaster? What the fuck? Wait. I'm not doing a zoo. I'm

585
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:36,309
not making a zoo. Pendulum ride. Okay. Ferris wheel. Roller coaster. Nice. House of horrors.

586
02:28:36,950 --> 02:29:16,059
Two more roller coasters. And then like a family fun center. Antelope enclosure. And elephant

587
02:29:16,059 --> 02:29:51,780
enclosure. Okay. Nice. Okay. Now, uh, make a road to here. They're angry about that. Wait,

588
02:29:51,780 --> 02:30:06,489
what did I just make? What the fuck is this? Look at how loud this is. Oh, this is upgrade.

589
02:30:06,489 --> 02:30:47,139
Please. All right. Come on in. Six bucks. Seven bucks. Okay. Hold on. This is really important to

590
02:30:47,139 --> 02:30:57,670
me. It's very important to me. I have to have somebody's backyard be the fucking

591
02:30:57,670 --> 02:31:25,139
elephant enclosure. All right. Anybody coming in? Oh shit. It's dead. What is this little guy?

592
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:57,129
Anybody coming in? He cares. I spent all his money, but he's leaving. Oh,

593
02:31:57,129 --> 02:32:22,020
I'm waiting for some crime rate is high. There's nobody else here. Only people

594
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:32,069
at the park of the mascot. There's no one else here. They're all just cartwheeling. Hey, kids.

595
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:54,520
Nobody on the rides. Wait, are the mascots riding the ride? This is only $160 a week. I would have

596
02:32:54,520 --> 02:33:07,850
think that elephants would be like thousands of fucking dollars a week. Oh, well that makes sense.

597
02:33:09,129 --> 02:33:22,420
That's right. Okay. Isolated. I just want someone to come in. I just want one person to come in

598
02:33:22,420 --> 02:33:56,940
and then I'm going to go eat food. I just want one person to see this. They're multiplying. There.

599
02:33:56,940 --> 02:34:20,040
Now go arrest them. This way. Arrest. Dude, look at that sea cafe. It's actually pretty cool.

600
02:34:20,680 --> 02:35:03,340
Customer. Customer. Come on into foot land. There you go. It's you. It's collectively you.

601
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:07,020
You're going to the pendulum ride. Are you guys ready for this shit?

602
02:35:14,250 --> 02:35:26,700
You're the cleaner at Frank's fish stick factory for over 20 years. Get there. You think your phone

603
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:33,159
is ringing whether you have a new phone, an old phone, or just make sure you always hear your

604
02:35:33,159 --> 02:35:58,360
phone. Why are there this many? They don't need to be this many. This is a sad fuck.

605
02:35:59,079 --> 02:36:11,340
Oh my God. You went all the way to the end.

606
02:36:22,629 --> 02:36:33,399
Come on in. Come on. Have some fun. It's your turn. By the way, fuck this ride. I would never

607
02:36:33,399 --> 02:36:39,209
get on it. I like amusement parks. I like going to Six Flags. I like Disney World or whatever,

608
02:36:40,090 --> 02:36:47,049
but these rides are only designed to make you feel awful. They're not fun. They just

609
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:56,020
only are made to make you feel like shit. They're not fun. This is not... Humans aren't supposed to

610
02:36:56,020 --> 02:37:03,670
be doing this. You don't see like the lions in the animal kingdom fucking swinging around in circles

611
02:37:04,549 --> 02:37:19,159
like this. We're not supposed to be doing this. No, they would not if they could. Your organs

612
02:37:19,159 --> 02:37:25,879
are not designed to be swam around like this. It's not supposed to be like this.

613
02:37:27,399 --> 02:37:45,959
Your kidneys like smush into each other when you're on a ride like this. When is it your turn?

614
02:37:49,979 --> 02:38:47,780
All right. Give me a second. I've got something very important to do. I'm just trying to make

615
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:58,520
as much noise as possible. Where'd you go? You're just still waiting. How long does the... Okay,

616
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:05,319
hold on a minute. How long does the pendulum ride last? This thing has been spinning for like three

617
02:39:05,319 --> 02:39:40,649
weeks. These people are dead. Does it stop? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

618
02:39:41,530 --> 02:40:05,420
I can't even click on you guys anymore. You're waiting to get on the pendulum ride.

619
02:40:06,139 --> 02:40:32,969
There's people on it.

620
02:41:03,479 --> 02:41:17,719
I don't matter. Goodbye. See you guys. See you guys tomorrow. I'm gonna get some food. See you

621
02:41:17,719 --> 02:41:23,319
tomorrow for... fucking mystery game. Who knows what it's gonna be. Actual mystery game tomorrow.

622
02:41:23,879 --> 02:41:30,139
And then Animal Crossing before the stream turns off. See you tomorrow for the mystery game.

623
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:36,649
Spin that wheel. It could be anything. It's gonna be an actual mystery. Because I don't know either.

624
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:50,629
McChicken review? No. This game is so much fun. I just... I'm not capable of doing anything that

625
02:41:50,629 --> 02:41:56,809
makes any sense. It's very fun for the last couple of days though. Maybe if I really sat here and

626
02:41:56,809 --> 02:42:02,569
like studied, I'd be able to do it. But it looks so much fun. This is a great game. I hope you

627
02:42:02,569 --> 02:42:16,549
guys like it. Double the disaster rate. It's so hard for me. I think it's hard for people that

628
02:42:16,549 --> 02:42:23,579
aren't smart. Or is it just hard for people that are stupid? Or no, it's hard for people that don't

629
02:42:23,579 --> 02:42:28,340
put the time in necessary to learn all the mechanics. Thanks dude. No, no, no, no, no.

630
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:38,100
Shit. No, no. I gotta, I gotta fix that. No, no, no, no. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix

631
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:43,219
it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it.

632
02:42:43,219 --> 02:42:53,829
Just hold on. That's not what I meant. I meant to say was start with me, not you. See you guys

633
02:42:59,959 --> 02:43:03,000
tomorrow. What was that? I don't know. I think something was wrong with your computer. You should

634
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,799
do a fucking virus game with MauraBytes. I'm sure you'll get some potentially unwanted programs

635
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:23,399
or PUPs. See you tomorrow. We're gonna do the bits. We'll hang out for a little bit

636
02:43:23,399 --> 02:43:30,040
and there'll be a mystery game tomorrow. That's right. Fucking mystery. See you soon. Thanks for

637
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:37,579
watching. Thanks for sticking around. Fish and Animal Crossing. I will. Don't worry. Tomorrow night

638
02:43:37,579 --> 02:43:41,989
we're gonna hang out for like probably at least an hour or two and just play it to end the stream.

639
02:43:42,549 --> 02:43:53,159
I need to go get food. Anyways, um, we had, I think I missed this earlier, but

640
02:43:53,719 --> 02:44:01,100
Ryobate gave 10 community subs earlier. I think I missed it. I always hate missing those. Thank you.

641
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:05,860
Pixel Mike, thanks for the five hundred bits. You sound insane today. Are you okay?

642
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:13,940
I think like one or two people in the stream asked that. Does that mean that it's that I'm

643
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:20,889
insane every day? I don't know. I think I'm fine. I think I'm normal. I'm a normal person. I ride

644
02:44:20,889 --> 02:44:28,020
my bike. I eat scrambled eggs just like you. Peaceful Haley, thanks for the two fifty.

645
02:44:28,579 --> 02:44:33,620
Jeremy, if it makes you feel any better, I named my island The Island. This is Animal Crossing.

646
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:38,020
Never good at naming my towns. Don't want to sit there for hours trying to think of a name.

647
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:48,739
I'm not very good at it either. I'm not good at it either, but I do, I do like salted crest.

648
02:44:48,739 --> 02:45:00,870
What's the name of the town? I have no idea. I already forgot. What's the name of the town?

649
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:08,389
Salt Crest? Yeah, thanks to the two fifty Haley. I'm also bad at naming things.

650
02:45:09,719 --> 02:45:14,120
Sukhoi Flanker, thanks for the five hundred bits. Hello Jeremy, I want to apologize a bit late

651
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:21,129
though for pressuring you to play stalker. I was drunk like right now. It's all good. It's all good.

652
02:45:21,129 --> 02:45:27,129
Remember, you cannot buy, you cannot buy me anything. You cannot make me play something

653
02:45:27,129 --> 02:45:40,840
but money for the monetary purchase. Flanker, I do appreciate the insane amount of money you gave,

654
02:45:41,479 --> 02:45:49,819
although it's completely unnecessary, but thank you. I hope I use it well. Thanks for the huge

655
02:45:49,819 --> 02:45:55,399
money, as always. Sticks, Renegade, thanks for the two fifty. Oh, so you draw the Joker on your shirt

656
02:45:55,399 --> 02:46:01,719
but you don't draw my fursona. I see how it is. Fuck you, Jeremy. Fuck, fuck you. Fuck you.

657
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:07,180
I'm never gonna draw a fursona. I'm never gonna draw somebody's fursona. It's not gonna happen

658
02:46:07,180 --> 02:46:15,739
unless it's mine, which is not gonna happen either. I'm never gonna do that. I'm never gonna do it.

659
02:46:16,059 --> 02:46:26,120
I can't, I can't, I'm never gonna do it. Ever, ever, ever. Thank you though. He has one to draw,

660
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:33,559
confirmed, whatever. I don't. Shadows1, Disciple, thanks for the two fifty. BaseStreamKing,

661
02:46:33,559 --> 02:46:42,739
heard this new team already has millions of fans. The Cincinnati Clowns. It's true though,

662
02:46:42,739 --> 02:46:48,420
I would watch every single game if they were a bunch of clowns that played football or baseball

663
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:53,219
or something. Wouldn't you, wouldn't you go there and cheer them the fuck on even if they were zero

664
02:46:53,219 --> 02:47:01,860
in a hundred? If they lost every single game, I wouldn't even care. Who cares? I'm seeing a

665
02:47:01,860 --> 02:47:08,090
lot of nos and it's, I can't believe it. I can't believe that you guys would not go support

666
02:47:08,729 --> 02:47:15,219
the Cincinnati Clowns. A full baseball team where they're in full clown makeup and full clown

667
02:47:15,219 --> 02:47:20,889
costumes. They just play regular baseball though. And sometimes like the pitcher will like take out

668
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:26,969
like a magical scarf before he throws a pitch. Like with a magician thing in the hands where

669
02:47:26,969 --> 02:47:31,350
it comes out a million times and he throws the ball. I guess that wouldn't be a regular baseball

670
02:47:31,350 --> 02:47:42,149
game then. Oh that would be so funny. I would, I would, if I ever had like hundreds of millions

671
02:47:42,149 --> 02:47:48,489
of dolls and I could run like a movie studio or a tv studio, I would make a tv show where there was

672
02:47:48,489 --> 02:47:53,049
at least one segment where the Cincinnati Clowns were just in the background playing and it was

673
02:47:53,049 --> 02:47:57,290
just there. It's not even really addressed. It's just they're there like somebody gets a fucking

674
02:47:57,290 --> 02:48:02,170
home run. Somebody falls down and shit and there's like car-tartoon noises and it would just be in

675
02:48:02,170 --> 02:48:08,940
the background and you wouldn't even know it was there. Why can't I just have a fucking hundred

676
02:48:08,940 --> 02:48:30,840
million dollars? You're a sucker. But what? Anyways let's look at their logo. This is a hockey team

677
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:47,540
apparently. That's pretty good. That's very good. Thanks to the 250 though. Hey dragon breath thanks

678
02:48:47,540 --> 02:48:52,420
to the 250. So that bot spam earlier linked to some guy stream playing Fortnite. I went to look

679
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:56,549
and the guy seemed to have no idea what was happening. Everyone just started harassing him

680
02:48:56,549 --> 02:49:00,229
and saying awful shit. His viewers jumped from two to two hundred when the spam happened. So I can

681
02:49:00,229 --> 02:49:04,069
only assume the harassing was coming from this chat. Just want to let you know and make clear

682
02:49:04,069 --> 02:49:08,170
members of chat that they should probably not do that. It was like a targeted bot campaign.

683
02:49:08,809 --> 02:49:16,549
That's fucking horrible. Why would you do something like that? That doesn't make any sense.

684
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:23,159
Were you just like spam stuff like as if it was them doing it or something? I don't know. That's

685
02:49:23,159 --> 02:49:40,020
unfortunate. I feel bad. That's too bad. No no it was not. Big thick ass. I forgot I said that.

686
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:46,040
I didn't do it papa. I swear. You better not have. I would be fucking upset about that. Leave people

687
02:49:46,040 --> 02:49:53,270
alone. Hey lemon thanks for the ten bucks thousand bits. During my beg of you please stop picking up

688
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:59,659
weeds. Yeah yeah less than chump change and you get more from fish or bugs. Yeah I remember I

689
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:11,479
we brought it up. I know. Oh I know. Now I sold like 300 of them. They'll come back. They'll be

690
02:50:11,479 --> 02:50:16,149
plenty of weeds tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll get them. Thanks for the thousand bits though.

691
02:50:16,149 --> 02:50:21,829
Two scoops thanks to the 250. Fireman they say. Fireman's great. Two scoops again 250.

692
02:50:21,829 --> 02:50:24,950
Dermot if there's ever a villager you don't like you can always harass them by hitting them with

693
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:32,840
your bug net until they get mad enough to want to leave. Try it. It's fun. I don't want to do that.

694
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:48,260
What's wrong with you? Rock writing thanks for the 300 bits. And everyone that heareth these

695
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:54,819
sayings of mine and doth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the

696
02:50:54,819 --> 02:51:00,420
sand and then rain descended in the floods and the winds and beat upon that house and it fell.

697
02:51:04,889 --> 02:51:13,059
Great was the fall. What is this? Is this the bible? I don't remember there being a fast car of

698
02:51:13,139 --> 02:51:18,489
speeding through the bible but apparently it's bible prophecy.

699
02:51:21,860 --> 02:51:28,620
Peaceful Haley thanks for the 250. Time traveling in Assassin's Creed. Time traveling in

700
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:36,889
Animal Crossing. Oh you motherfucker. Time traveling in Animal Crossing has always been a thing.

701
02:51:37,530 --> 02:51:41,930
I don't know why people are acting like it's the end of the world. Sorry but when you

702
02:51:41,930 --> 02:51:46,090
got no friends and AC's all you got time traveling is the best. Doesn't screw anything up.

703
02:51:47,290 --> 02:51:52,969
Also German do whatever you want ignore chat. I was thinking about it then I thought

704
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:59,540
Animal Crossing is a game that you can't really just play once and be like oh that was fun bye

705
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:05,479
turn it off. If you want to play it you have to play it over the course of at least a week or two

706
02:52:05,479 --> 02:52:10,819
you have to just give it the time. So it makes a lot more sense instead of just skipping time

707
02:52:10,819 --> 02:52:15,059
and streaming it for like six seven eight hours and being like oh it's cool we'll do it again

708
02:52:15,059 --> 02:52:22,020
some other time. Just play the game the way you sleep your character gets up in real time and

709
02:52:22,020 --> 02:52:26,260
here it is it's eight nine ten o'clock eleven o'clock pm pacific at night and we're just going

710
02:52:26,260 --> 02:52:34,659
to do it for like an hour each night. I'm going to log into it every right now like these parts of

711
02:52:34,659 --> 02:52:40,409
the streams is when you'll see it and I'll just be looking over at the dashboard and reading bits

712
02:52:40,409 --> 02:52:49,610
and stuff while we do weeds and pick up stuff. It should be nice and chill. Thank you. Hey big

713
02:52:49,610 --> 02:52:54,729
thick ass thanks for the 300 bits good stream son this was a wonderful family reunion. It went

758
02:59:55,239 --> 03:00:04,649
know about the first stream ever what was the first stream ever did anybody know what was the

759
03:00:04,649 --> 03:00:17,659
first thing I ever live streamed was it 10 million is team fortress are we are you sure I don't know

760
03:00:17,659 --> 03:00:26,219
no I mean this is like this is like eight years ago I don't know no my first streams were not on

761
03:00:26,219 --> 03:00:37,159
twitch they were on the original youtube live back in like 2012 2013 maybe some founders will

762
03:00:37,159 --> 03:00:53,180
know it was tf2 okay interesting time flies when you get old d warden thanks for the thousand bits

763
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:59,579
10 bucks hey jerma what do you what do you what do you do if you think your friends just act like

764
03:00:59,579 --> 03:01:05,209
they like you what do you do if you think your friends just act like they like you what do you

765
03:01:05,209 --> 03:01:14,299
mean like they don't they're like for they're pretending to like you I say you gotta try to

766
03:01:14,299 --> 03:01:19,819
make some new friends that doesn't sound maybe if there's somebody's pretending to like that that

767
03:01:24,040 --> 03:01:27,319
yeah I would move on to some another group of people or try to find some new friends

768
03:01:28,040 --> 03:01:40,010
how do you make friends well um it's not really that's it's kind of a hard question because

769
03:01:40,889 --> 03:01:48,250
I honestly I'll be completely completely upfront with you I I haven't made a whole lot of new

770
03:01:48,250 --> 03:01:56,809
friends in the last five to ten years I'm also a lot older though I have a lot of long

771
03:01:57,450 --> 03:02:03,370
term long-time friends that I met a long time ago that I've just it's they've stayed around for

772
03:02:03,370 --> 03:02:20,840
decades 35 you should be making children but when I was younger it was really was just based on

773
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:27,879
interests for me it was when I'm when I was in college or I remember just you know yeah I played

774
03:02:27,879 --> 03:02:34,680
a lot of video games and it was other people that played them too and one of your one of my roommates

775
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:39,399
had consoles and it was like oh it's a nice cool console you gotta play s3 yeah cool what do you

776
03:02:39,399 --> 03:02:45,989
play and you just base it around interests make it you make friends because people that you want

777
03:02:45,989 --> 03:02:50,549
to spend time with the people that also think the same things that you think are interesting that's

778
03:02:50,549 --> 03:03:01,020
how you kind of hang out with them in the first place or people that you spend enough time with

779
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:06,149
that you can get to know them to be able to call them a friend somebody that you spend enough time

780
03:03:06,149 --> 03:03:11,670
with and you like them and you actually genuinely don't you know if you don't get along with one of

781
03:03:11,670 --> 03:03:15,350
your co-workers or something then it's like okay well then why would you want to be that person's

782
03:03:15,350 --> 03:03:26,649
friend you got to base it around your interests and stuff that you have in common as that really

783
03:03:26,649 --> 03:03:33,770
is the only advice I can give only because I haven't really spent that much time making new

784
03:03:33,770 --> 03:03:40,709
friends I just have a I have a lot of old friends and it's almost like I made a bunch of friends

785
03:03:40,709 --> 03:03:44,809
when I was younger and they that I don't really need to make anymore if that makes any sense

786
03:03:47,850 --> 03:03:55,379
I got all these buddies back in in Massachusetts I've known for decades like decades fucking 20

787
03:03:55,379 --> 03:04:02,540
30 plus years and I'm incredibly close with those people and then there's also people that I've met

788
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:06,780
on this platform there's people that I've met on like YouTube and Twitch that I I would call

789
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:22,780
pretty close friends all right but not recently not in the last probably five plus years is it

790
03:04:22,780 --> 03:04:31,020
hard making friends being quote famous no no I mean that I wouldn't even I don't think that's

791
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:43,750
accurate because I don't think I'm that I don't think I'm famous I think I'm a person of interest

792
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:52,819
on Twitch I don't think that makes me famous I think famous would entail like 50,000 concurrent

793
03:04:52,819 --> 03:04:58,020
people here or like I make a post on Instagram and it gets like seven million likes I think

794
03:04:58,020 --> 03:05:12,020
at that point you're famous famous entails I think a lot of like public knowledge right but

795
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:17,700
no I'm I doesn't I I've told you this before when this stream turns off I'm just I'm a regular guy

796
03:05:17,700 --> 03:05:30,379
that sits around eats potato chips watches tv goes to the fucking store Lil Nas retweeted rat

797
03:05:30,379 --> 03:05:38,379
movie though yeah so so a famous person retweeted a thing that I had something maybe to do with

798
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:55,530
that doesn't make me famous right you know saying but you created it yeah but the rat's famous

799
03:05:55,530 --> 03:06:04,520
not me right and that I kind of prefer it that way Lil Nas doesn't even know you exist bro I

that germa not only died to pinwheel but also lost on the tutorial of plants versus zombies

838
03:11:59,829 --> 03:12:07,030
but no the the losing to the tutorial on plants versus zombies is because in my ear there was a

839
03:12:07,030 --> 03:12:16,260
producer telling me we the bot is broken you have to burn time and talk our everything is

840
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:19,379

842
03:12:22,659 --> 03:12:27,620
placing fucking plants and shit I'm sitting there listening to a guy in my ear talk about

843
03:12:28,420 --> 03:12:38,729
how the stream might need to turn off because everything was fucked up so sorry I wasn't

844
03:12:38,729 --> 03:12:47,209
paying attention to plants versus zombies one until you prove it to us you lost to the tutorial

845
03:12:47,209 --> 03:12:57,219
I could turn on plants versus zombies right now and beat the tutorial with my eyes closed do it

846
03:12:57,219 --> 03:13:02,139

and tired and shit thanks for the 250 I didn't even die to pinwheel that's a funny fucking joke

848
03:13:08,729 --> 03:13:13,530
that we all like hey Keith King Crimson thanks for the 250 a lot of the times people feel like

849
03:13:13,530 --> 03:13:17,610
their friends are just pretending their friends really do care about them and do like them people

850
03:13:17,610 --> 03:13:21,750
don't usually pretend to be friends with someone these kinds of feelings usually come out of a

851
03:13:21,750 --> 03:13:27,110
place of paranoia and self-esteem issues I've experienced it a lot maybe the other chatter

852
03:13:27,110 --> 03:13:30,709
how to talk to their friends about it if they're real friends they'll care enough to confirm that

853
03:13:30,709 --> 03:13:51,430
they're not faking it that is true too that's true too I saw him died and you did not you did not

854
03:13:55,590 --> 03:13:59,590
you guys have no idea which top but anyways let's get back to let's get to the real shit here

855
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:09,879
yeah the thing is it's everyone we kind of get in our own heads sometimes because you know all of

856
03:14:09,879 --> 03:14:17,379
your insecurities but nobody else does so it's it's very easy for you for all of us to kind of

857
03:14:17,379 --> 03:14:26,299
project our insecurities because we're up here in our own heads and we think that other people see

858
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:36,389
and know some of these things they don't you implant thoughts in people's brains that they

859
03:14:36,389 --> 03:14:47,899
don't even have sometimes that does make sense actually that's pretty good advice thanks Keith

860
03:14:47,899 --> 03:14:56,899

September that'll probably happen maybe somewhere in like July or August something like that

880
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:48,059
somewhere probably around August let's just hope that this um this virus is under control by then
