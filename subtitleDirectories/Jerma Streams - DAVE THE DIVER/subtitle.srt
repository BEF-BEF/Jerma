1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:37,659
What is going on? How are you doing? Too early? It's a little early. You ever like make a sound

2
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,579
and you get caught on your own words? And it makes a sound you've never made before?

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:51,700
That is what just happened. Can I refill my coffee? Of course I can. Give me two seconds.

4
00:00:51,700 --> 00:03:45,099
Okay, I'm back. Hello. Sorry, it took me so long. I had to sprint really, really fast.

5
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:55,610
Yeah, but the coffee that I have in the fridge, it's like, um, oof. It's like maybe like two or

6
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:10,580
three minute run from here. That would suck. Can I just say, when you think about like big houses

7
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:19,980
or like big places. Oh yeah, 17,000 square foot house. I would never want to live in one of those.

8
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:45,060
Ever. I would think that there were ghosts in every room. No way. Then why do you? Dude, if you

9
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,279
have them, if you have room for a bowling alley in your house, I don't want to live there.

10
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,139
I appreciate smaller spaces. I think you can do way more with a smaller space. I don't like big

11
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:15,399
spaces. I lose shit. You know, how many times I pace around the living room, just like under my

12
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:23,399
breath going like, where the fuck are they? How is it fucking possible to lose, to lose my wallet

13
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,589
again? How is it even possible? I'll pace around. I'll go into the bathroom. Was it in here?

14
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:38,329
It's not even possible. And then, you know, end up finding it in the couch,

15
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:48,540
but imagine that times like 10. It would be so awful. I would have to have 10 or 20 wallets.

16
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,990
I'd have to have like 10 phones just in every room. It's a skill issue. Oh, that's wow. Yeah,

17
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:15,990
it is. Absolutely. I love this. Have you, have you been to Greek chicken? They got a new location.

18
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:31,110
Food slaps. I'll check it out if it's up. See, I'm always into new food. Stop bragging about

19
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,110
your phones and wallets. I don't have 10 phones in 10 wallets. I'm saying if I lived in a big,

20
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,339
huge house, I would need to have like five or 10 different wallets. No, I would have,

21
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:50,660
I would have a landline. I'd have a landline that I know where the phone is at all times.

22
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,100
I don't need to think about it. I don't need to. I know I want a landline. So many of us that have

23
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:07,589
so many problems remembering where our phone is. I want to bring the landline back. Anyways,

24
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:16,300
let's talk. We got a few things to go over here. The first one is what we're doing today. Dave,

25
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,910
the diver is in 1.0. It's been on the list for a long time. Sorry about the milk voice.

26
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:33,660
Ah, trying to get rid of it with some coffee. So game is really good. I have heard it's very good.

27
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,379
I've been told this is right up my alley. I've been told, Jeremy, you got to try this out. You

28
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:45,060
got to check it out. And yeah, it's in 1.0 now. So why not? Let's give it a go. Second important

29
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,110
thing is this stream is only going to be for about maybe just about three hours because we're going

30
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:59,050
to raid Connor's stream, Sea Dog. Connor is doing a charity stream today, a charity auction stream,

31
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:11,379
which I have a couple of bundles in. There are two bundles. There is a raffle bundle,

32
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:20,899
and then there is an auction bundle. So you'll have to bear with me here while I explain what

33
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:28,490
they are. The first one, the raffle item, which the Grotto Beast Twitter, obviously I already

34
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,379
talked about this, but if you want, but I can give you more details. The raffle item is four

35
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:43,480
of the OG archaeology stream cards, and I believe they're all holographic.

36
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:54,279
So if you remember the archaeology stream, the fake packs that I opened, four of those cards

37
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:01,779
are going to be in this charity raffle. Also, there's going to be a copy of the map.

38
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:14,730
Remember the map prop? They were fake. Yeah, Holly made a ton of those cards here,

39
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,889
so we picked out the ones that kind of looked the best, felt the best out of all the ones that were

40
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:29,419
made for the original stream, and each one is from each individual artist, the four original team

41
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:37,350
of the original stream. It's a pretty cool item, but you also get the map too. So that prop map,

42
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,789
maybe the one with the grandpa, like, oh, he left me the map, and it was all burnt.

43
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,529
We made a copy of that map just in case something happened to the original one,

44
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,350
and I've had that here for a couple of years, so you get that too. That's part of the bundle.

45
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:57,769
And it's a raffle too, so this is not the auction item. I know a lot of people were saying like,

46
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:04,009
oh shit, okay, some germamite's going to come in and drop tons of money, and I'm not going to

47
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:17,340
have a chance at all. Well, the raffle is for you then. The auction is two Grotto Beasts

48
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:26,279
holographic test sheets. So they're holographic print sheets that the printer sent us to approve

49
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:33,860
the second print, and I signed both of them. And it's really interesting because the two sheets

50
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:43,269
that are in this auction, their holographics don't exist in the real game. It's a different

51
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:50,840
holographic type that is on these because they were tests, so they don't exist in the regular

52
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:59,799
game. There's also a postcard that we sent to friends and family, so holographic postcard as

53
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:13,269
well. They're holographic testies. They're uncut. Yes, they are uncut sheets. Are you going to auction

54
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:29,450
the ass baseball? Uh, no. That's for me. But those are two different bundles. One's a raffle,

55
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,370
one's an auction, and we did it that way because I wanted more people to participate. I wanted

56
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,610
more people to see it and be able to, you know, throw, you know, less than five, ten bucks at

57
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:46,570
an item and potentially get it rather than an auction that could go up into the hundreds,

58
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,929
if not maybe the thousands. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I think a lot of money is

59
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:56,169
going to get raised. There's a lot of really cool items. Tons of streamers and YouTubers have given

60
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:08,149
stuff, so we'll rate it in a few hours. You sound constipated. I know, I've got my like voice and

61
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:14,379
throat and body. Everything's a little jumbled today, the last few days I'd say. I'm kind of

62
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:21,080
jumbled and having stomach intestinal problems too. I'm all jumbled up. I'll be all right,

63
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:33,190
though. Don't worry. Let's get a little bit more coffee in me. I'll be good. Did he say testicles?

64
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:48,259
It's not a testicle problem, okay? Oh my god. All right, you guys ready to play Dave the Diva?

65
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:03,659
Let's play it. I'm interested. Hey, what's on the agenda today? You're gonna play this one game,

66
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:09,830
you're gonna be playing anything else after? Just this for probably two and a half hours or so,

67
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,549
and then I'm gonna dump you all on Connor's stream. I think the, I think one of the items,

68
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:22,279
I think the raffle item, I think is happening pretty early. So, I would, you know, he's stalling?

69
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,860
I mean, yeah, very importantly. I'm gonna give you guys some info. Can you shout out my cat? Hey,

70
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,899
Mr. Fuzzy! Thanks for watching the stream. You didn't say where your cat's name was,

71
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:44,059
so I just assumed what it was. All right, let's go. This is gonna chill out. I'm gonna play Dave

72
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:57,259
the Diva and then we'll continue. It's Mr. Fuzzy, Mr. Fuzzle, what is it? I didn't see it.

73
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:08,250
That's a valid assumption. Yeah, I think it was. What's the charity? The charity,

74
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:18,549
hold on. Yeah, there's, shit, hold on. Let me, hold on. Give me a second. It's the Immune

75
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:28,870
Deficiency Foundation. Hold on, I gotta write something. Immune Deficiency Foundation. No,

76
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:41,909
I knew what it was. I just, I have to talk to somebody. Give me one second. How do you raffle?

77
00:14:41,909 --> 00:15:04,490
Hold on, give me one second. Okay, you don't want a notification, but I can't even talk today. You

78
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,809
know when a notification pops up in your phone and it just kind of ruins your entire train of

79
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:18,470
thought? That's what just happened. That doesn't happen to anybody. He had to take a bong rip.

80
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:35,159
That does not happen to anybody else. Come on. All right, let's go. I get distracted incredibly

81
00:15:35,159 --> 00:16:01,049
easily. We know. Facecam? No, not today. Not right now. I feel terrible. You know what I mean? Like,

82
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,629
this is, this is not facecam days. The last like four or five days, I'd say. These are very much

83
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:28,549
anti-facecam days. Well, terrible is the wrong word. Terrible would imply that I, you know,

84
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:42,860
I'd feel, I just feel like, ugh. That's the best way to describe it. What about the classic no-cam

85
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:59,190
germa era? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Okay, I don't know very much about this game. I just

86
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:08,009
know that I wanted to play it. Is this a roguelike? Is this a trinket collector? Is this a, you fight

87
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:32,359
stuff? It's a granny-like. I doubt this is a granny-like. What's the last granny-like that

88
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:53,700
came out? Hello Neighbor? It's, I don't, Hello Neighbor came out like seven years ago. This has

89
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:07,940
definitely been one since then. Oh, Dave, you got here quickly. Hello? Oh, there we go. Well, I was

90
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,549
told to hurry here. I was on vacation, you know. So where's the sushi at? Don't rush yourself. Have

91
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:21,609
a look around. Look at this giant blue hole. I've never seen anything like this. It's not just the

92
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:26,490
size. Every time you enter the giant blue hole, the terrain and ecology changes, which means

93
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,339
this could be an incredible business opportunity. What kind of business? Well, we can discuss that

94
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:38,069
later. I heard you took a break from diving. How about warming up? I'll guide you from here. Go

95
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:49,109
ahead and go in. I don't have a good feeling about this. Okay. A sushi bar. Try moving with,

96
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,470
oh, which one is, what is that? I have X, Y, A, and B. Is it a bumper? Left bumper?

97
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:13,049
A shitload of you just screamed at the screen. I'm just relaxed. Okay. That was a test. That was a

98
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:30,390
test to see how patient you really are. And a lot of you aren't. Move to the marked area. So this is

99
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:52,329
like a boost. How's the volume? Good? Okay. The dive knife. Use the dive knife. Ooh, smooth and quick.

100
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:56,920
Finally, you haven't forgotten how to use the harpoon, have you? Harpoon? Well, I haven't used

101
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,339
one in a long time. I came first. It looks like you need some practice. Try the harpoon to catch,

102
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:08,619
let's say, three fish. Got a huge announcement, by the way. I have an unbelievably massive

103
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:13,720
announcement, and I waited until this many people were here to tell you it. Massive announcement.

104
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:26,549
Unbelievably massive. Ladies and gentlemen, the first ever House Flipper Invitational,

105
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:37,960
where a bunch of streamers make a house and I have to grade it, is officially on Monday.

106
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:50,150
Monday at 4 o'clock Pacific. Time might change, but Monday the 3rd is the House Flipper Invitational.

107
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,269
Well, that's what I'm calling it. There's no official, nothing official with House Flipper,

108
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:06,069
but I think that's going to be a ton of fun. Whoa. Aim with A and press right trigger to fire. Oh,

109
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:18,710
I get it. That's sick. I will announce who is going to be in it, probably on Twitter and on

110
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,829
Discord and everything, and they'll probably talk about it too, but so far I've been reaching

111
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:29,609
out to people. So far we've got, we've got a good group so far. And just in case anything comes up

112
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:37,029
and the kind of roster changes, I'll wait like another day or two. But yeah, we got some good,

113
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:45,480
good people coming up. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'll have different grading criteria.

114
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:54,180
Everybody gets, and here, this is actually, here, hear me out. Is 60 minutes, if everybody starts at

115
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:00,740
the same time, is his ass has no plan. I got a whole document written. I have 60 minutes.

116
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,809
Everybody starts at the same time and everybody's graded on five different criteria.

117
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:13,180
Do you think 60 minutes is enough time? You're stuttering today. Yeah, I know. I'm a stuttering

118
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,500
guy. I'm usually like that. And when I don't feel that great, it's like amplified. So you're going

119
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,380
to get like triple the stutters today. Is 90 better? I feel like 90 was what it was originally,

120
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,539
but I'm kind of afraid to have it be 90. I feel like 90 might be a little too long.

121
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:40,599
The last time when me and Ludwig did this for the bro versus bro, it was 40 minutes and it felt like

122
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,599
it was okay. It was all right, but I would have liked a little bit more time, but not that much

123
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:58,539
more. 75 split the difference. We'll see. But it's somewhere, somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes

124
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:12,099
is what it will be. Yeah. Everyone's going to start with the same house and everyone starts at

125
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,519
the same time. It's going to be like a chopped on food network scenario where it's like, hands up,

126
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:27,079
everybody stop. Okay. I got to read this. Hold on. 75 is good. I think we start with 60 and then we

127
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:35,400
can add time if we want to. We can do like a, let's veto everything and add 15 minutes, depending.

128
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,160
Who knows? It could get to a point where we get to 55 minutes or like 45 minutes and everybody's

129
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:49,430
just done. Like, oh, okay. Cause I want it to be pressure. They're going to be graded on creativity,

130
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,970
complexity, cleanliness, structural integrity, philosophy. I've got a whole five point system

131
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:10,329
and they have to take me through a tour of the house one by one. Philosophy. Yeah. Oh, by the

132
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:15,619
way, and chats grade on, and there's going to be a weighted scale. I put a lot of thought into this.

133
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:21,220
I tell you, I've got, I got a whole document with all my things in it. Yeah. Chat will get a grade.

134
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:38,789
When are you going to do a twerking competition? All right. Yeah. That's a, that's coming up on

135
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:45,990
Monday. Now it's possible that some things need to be changed. This is, you know, I'm going to,

136
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,119
I'm leaving it up in the air, but July 3rd is the date. Gotta make sure to get everybody at the same

137
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,359
time. A lot of people have different schedules, trying to get a bunch of people to do it at the

138
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:04,940
same time. So I'll give you more info this coming weekend. So just get the ingredients.

139
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,170
You got it. So I can eat as much sushi as I want. Yeah, sure. You have to pay though.

140
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:32,920
Let's check it out. Go sushi. His ass is not reading. Well, I'm reading some of it.

141
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:46,059
Okay, let's go. It's already finished. You, you're the fisherman Cobra was talking about.

142
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,849
Well, I'm more of a diver than a fisherman. All right. Anyway, it's nice to meet you. I'm

143
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:56,650
Bansho. So you like sushi? Sure do. Tuna belly, eel, sirloin, oh boy, just think about it makes

144
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,819
my mind water. Just as mediocre as I expected. Sushi is a food that combines the soul of sea

145
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:08,809
and land. It symbolizes mother nature herself. Most people, however, have only tasted more

146
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,329
accessible fish, just like you. How empty a life is one that ends without ever tasting the beauty

147
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:18,940
mother nature can offer. My calling is to bring the taste of mother nature to every...

148
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:39,269
What's wrong with those choices? What's wrong with tuna? An earthquake. The interior is really quite

149
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:45,190
a mess. Looks like we're gonna have to delay the opening. You know what? Spend all my money

150
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,710
getting this restaurant ready. I'll have to recover the repair costs though doing business.

151
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:55,059
In this state? Well, ha ha ha ha. In the end, the importance of a restaurant is the taste.

152
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,640
First we need ingredients. Did you bring anything? Well, I have something I just caught.

153
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,940
Only three fish. This won't be nearly enough to serve the guests. Please go and catch seven

154
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:19,930
more fish. The restaurant's gonna be open only in the evening. Okay. What? It's the chef's duty

155
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,730
to prepare the best possible food with meticulous precision, just as a warrior sharpens his sword

156
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,789
on a whetstone. You need to get me the best quality ingredients during the day. I can do that.

157
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:43,299
People are so mad. Why? Because of my blah ha ha ha? I think every blah ha ha ha that I do,

158
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:53,049
I lose like 50 followers. I have to be careful. How many followers do I have? How many times can

159
00:27:53,049 --> 00:28:00,490
I do blah ha ha and lose 50 people a day before I lose all these followers? I wonder how long

160
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:09,559
it would take. It's probably gonna take a while. I'll be all right. I've been seeing

161
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:13,720
Banshee so enthusiastic since the incident. Oops, maybe I shouldn't have brought that up.

162
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:21,670
Well, anyways, we need more ingredients. Go catch seven fish. Followers plummeting.

163
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:32,230
No, no, my followers, my followers. Okay. Make a hundred gold and catch fish. Let's do it.

164
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:40,740
You go deeper than your current equipment allows. Your oxygen will flash red and will

165
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:51,799
deplete quickly. Okay. Catch fish. Make money. I got it. Does it matter what fish I get?

166
00:28:51,799 --> 00:29:12,519
This one pyramid butterfly fish. Do I, does the quality go down if I use the harpoon?

167
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:19,420
Kind of like a Red Dead Redemption situation. Like am I messing up the quality? No. Okay.

168
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:42,359
Nah. All right. Good. Oh, look at these ones. What's that? I can't pick it up. Really?

169
00:29:42,359 --> 00:30:07,319
Do I need a better harpoon? Oh, you just have to tap it. Okay. You need to weaken them if

170
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:17,420
their HP is too high. Okay. So do I, do I have to go up or will it kind of be like,

171
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,099
Hey, your oxygen is low. It's time to end the day. Or do I have to physically go all the way up

172
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:34,819
physically with the character? What is that? Ooh. Okay. The O2 just is the timer. You do not have

173
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:56,069
to go up. Okay. So I get to increase time by seeing those on the ground. Got it. I'm gonna

174
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:25,049
just only go for these ones. Two times with the harpoon. What's in the pot? Potion? Soy sauce.

175
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:40,970
New. Do I have to make recipes or something? What about the giant eel? Can I die? Okay. I

176
00:31:40,970 --> 00:32:04,630
think I can die. So that's a bad idea. That thing looks rare. Running out of air. Warning. Give me

177
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,680
this first. All right. Go. Do I have to go up? I thought you guys said I didn't have to go up.

178
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:38,819
You said I didn't have to go up. Did one guy do that? Do you still need oxygen? I definitely

179
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:55,720
made 100. Prepare sushi ingredients. Ooh. Okay. Biggest fish was that one. Two stars. Cooking

180
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,549
ingredients? Fish. Two fish tank. Do I have to wrap up your day and get things ready at the

181
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:09,369
sushi place? Okay. You can only dive once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Get the

182
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:15,880
ingredients ready before the dinner hours start. Isn't it like 10 o'clock at night? What time is

183
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:34,150
it? It's late. How about you let me play this game? We'll just go get it. It's on steam right now.

184
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:51,369
Okay. Bring ingredients back. Okay. You can check your fish, crops, sauces, and all the other

185
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:55,940
materials you have. For now, that's all you need to know. Come back later for more information.

186
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:10,699
I have to make a menu? New recipes need to be added to the menu before they can be sold to

187
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,579
customers. There's a sushi recipe for the fish you acquired earlier, so try registering that

188
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:31,059
to the menu. What do we got? Clown fish sushi. What's the most expensive one? Four? Ten? This

189
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:44,940
one's ten. Add three. E-clown sushi. Setting ingredients to auto-supply will make things a

190
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,320
bit more convenient. Let me repeat. Only food on the menu can be sold. If you run out of ingredients,

191
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:00,730
you'll have to replace items on the menu or refill the ingredients. You can enhance the flavor with

192
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:15,880
the soy sauce. Okay. Just put the most expensive ones on. This one's, this one's nine. I can put

193
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:29,699
12 on here. Okay. Spill the whole menu out. Six and then four. Prawns are high. All right. That's

194
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:40,150
good, right? Give me a cup of green tea. Have you poured green tea before? No, only soft drinks.

195
00:35:40,150 --> 00:36:02,840
You only had soda? Is this like Diner Dash? Do I have to do a Diner Dash game? Pour the right amount.

196
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:22,659
It kept going. It's good it was the tutorial because that kept pouring. I'm not doing it.

197
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:31,690
Wait until the cooking is done. Is there a sprint? Come over to where I am. Take the food.

198
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:54,489
Take up the food. You can dash when serving food. Can I drop it? What the hell? The food can't be

199
00:36:54,489 --> 00:37:00,840
reused with throw it out. It's such a waste. We never reuse food. We do not put food made for

200
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:15,079
guests on the table twice. And I just eat it? Don't forget to press Y after filling the menu

201
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:32,780
for business to begin. All right. Open the business. What can I get you? Green tea? We got it.

202
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:52,539
That's pretty good. All right. What do you want? Who ordered first? I don't remember. I'm already

203
00:37:52,539 --> 00:38:14,250
out of stamina. Does somebody's leave unhappy? I can only go as fast as he can cook. Anybody need

204
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:33,429
tea? Does anybody need any tea? I have to clean. You ordered first, but whatever. This is what

205
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:42,650
I'm talking about. Yep. I have negative $52. Wait, what? Oh, right, right, right. Okay. I was going

206
00:38:42,650 --> 00:39:10,090
to say, what did I do? My service so bad that I have to pay. Not quite there, but in its debt.

207
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:24,409
It's debt. All right. $77. So I got to get some better stuff. This game's cool. I like this game.

208
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:38,940
You're a bit clumsy, but not bad for a first day. Try a little harder next time. Okay. He likes it.

209
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:58,869
What are you doing? All right. This game keeps changing the game that I think it is

210
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:15,050
every 10 minutes. There are gigantic monsters. There's a lot to this game, to be honest. Yeah,

211
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:26,699
this looks cool. Are you the man who's been diving around here? I think so. I was expecting a more

212
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:33,539
professional looking guy. I can hear you. In any case, can you do something for me? Can you tell

213
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:39,059
me who you are first? I'm Ellie. I study biology at the local graduate school. I've come out to

214
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,659
investigate after reports of anomalies in the area. Satisfied? Okay. So what do you want?

215
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:54,409
I'd like to study the ecology of this blue hole. Get me some agar and red starfish. I don't think

216
00:40:54,409 --> 00:41:01,530
it's a good idea to ask for just one of each, so get me two. Your tone makes me want to refuse.

217
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:14,300
Got a reward. If you don't want it, that's fine. Reward? This is a side quest I'm imagining, right?

218
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:39,659
Okay. Phone. Wait, he's on the boat. A waste of phone fees. Talk to me in person. Throw the

219
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:59,059
phone into the ocean. All right. That's, that's cool. Let's go. I get it now. Call them again.

220
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:21,059
You definitely don't get it. I, of course I do. Watch. I want to pick up ingredients. All right.

221
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:27,239
Only good fish. I don't want, like, look at this is, it's not gonna wow anybody at the restaurant.

222
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,119
Underwater scooter? Allows you to move quickly underwater. Can't be used once the battery runs

223
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:50,489
out. 10 second of battery use? Oh, so it's a, it's a boost. He thinks the big fish equal best fish.

224
00:42:50,489 --> 00:43:16,099
Early on, I would say that's probably accurate. Sword? Ooh. Does this thing have durability?

225
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:31,429
Blue tang? Rainbow rice? Rassy? Ras? What was it? You're wasting oxygen. How do you think

226
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:40,469
Peter Griffin would feel about this game? Uh, I'm sorry. Peter Griffin wouldn't play this game.

227
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:47,190
Peter Griffin would do a callback reference to when he was the main character of this game.

228
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:55,130
You've got your family guy wrong. Oh, it hurts. I don't think sea urchin is gonna be picked up

229
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:09,400
with these gloves. Really? He's so mad. I, I'm not picking that up yet. I don't need it yet.

230
00:44:09,400 --> 00:45:00,150
Ooh, look at these ones. I need those. These are gonna be so expensive. He is seething with rage.

231
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:09,610
What's that big one right there? Okay. That, that attacked me. If you exceed your weight limit,

232
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:14,150
you will slow down. If you exceed an even higher amount, you won't be able to carry anymore.

233
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:37,619
Organize? Overburdened? Uh, what's the shittiest thing I have? This thing's pretty awful,

234
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:46,940
but it's the one I just got. Take off. It's the, your oxygen mask. Uh, this thing's like,

235
00:45:46,940 --> 00:46:14,360
eh, this is just seaweed. Okay. These are two stars. I'm almost there. I, should I go up now?

236
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:36,179
9.7, 9.1. Okay. Well, I have to go up. Nice math. I'm learning. I just, I just learned.

237
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:55,260
Skulls indicate poison. Let me go back up. I have a full inventory. You're playing it wrong.

238
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:09,539
It's the second dive. I got a, I got a trigger fish. Those things are worth millions of

239
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:28,460
decimal points. I did notice that the fish in the blue hole have an odd violent streak. Something

240
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,260
puts them on edge. Speaking of which, why don't you also take a gun in addition to the harpoon?

241
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:46,199
A gun. My friend who's knowledgeable about guns. Who's the goofy guy? I'm Dave. I thought divers

242
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:52,440
were athletic and muscular. You seem to defy my prior knowledge. People who live in glass houses.

243
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,639
Oh yeah, that's right. So what's this about? I'd like to get straight to the point. I've begun a

244
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:06,570
very interesting business. This guy laughs a lot. And now I'm in need of some weapons. Duff, I need

245
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:12,010
your help. Hmm. Season two of The Straw Stella just ended anyway. I'll give you a listen. I

246
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:18,090
discovered a fascinating giant blue hole. The terrain and ecology inside, it changes every

247
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,639
time you go inside. Any equipment found inside breaks down when brought out. I'd like you to

248
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:35,659
make us a weapon that can be used inside. Anything that's not made from materials found in the blue

249
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:42,460
hole will continue to break down. So it'd be especially true of guns, precision parts. So

250
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,699
we'll have to get the materials from overseas. I thought that just said from overseas. I was like,

251
00:48:46,699 --> 00:49:00,710
what? Okay. I need one rope and one scrap iron. You heard him right, Dave. Enter the blue hole and

252
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:08,710
bring back rope and scrap iron. If you run out of oxygen midway, you'll only be able to make it

253
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:27,260
back with one item. So that's the penalty. Okay. Um, I have to, I have to get rid of stuff. Can I

254
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,860
store the fish that I have right now? Or should I just bring them over to the menu? Cause I can

255
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:40,650
die again. You already did. Oh, so I can go back now. You already did that. Your inventory is auto.

256
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:56,599
Okay. I'll go back down. I need rope, iron, sunflower update. We're getting some really good

257
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:03,380
pictures. They just started opening as of two or three days ago. The last three or four days,

258
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:12,250
I want to say. We have a Hydra. This thing was really healthy and was really, it was fed very

259
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:20,059
well apparently. This sunflower, the big one has like eight heads. It's going to be crazy looking.

260
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:28,230
All right. Can I pick this up? Starfish. All right. There's that. I need two of those.

261
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:51,000
Ow. What? I need a scrap of iron. This is wood. All right. Don't use too much oxygen. I don't know.

262
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:15,739
Why is this depth blinking? The depth thing is blinking. Why? I'm too deep. Am I? Am I actually

263
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:29,880
too deep? But there's rope down here and wood. All right. I need one more. Where's my, um,

264
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:45,909
quest log? I need one more. All right. Go up, go up, go up. I need oxygen. I gotta get out of here.

265
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:56,500
Hurry up and get out of here. Shit. I thought I was going to die much quicker than that.

266
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:11,579
You have the harpoon. I do have the harpoon. You're right. Basic underwater rifle. Download

267
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:43,139
Duff's weapon shop. Only 42 megabytes. What the hell is going on? There was a missed opportunity

268
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:50,309
there. I feel like this is the character that would say exquisite. This is exquisite, right?

269
00:52:50,309 --> 00:53:07,769
So this replaces the harpoon, I'm going to imagine. I can open a weapon chest.

270
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:26,420
Blueprints. So if I make it with a blueprint, they won't break down underwater.

271
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:31,900
Nice. I hope that when you're 50, you look back at what you said and cringe.

272
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:38,309
Ball fondler. Why are there like three of you now? I just read another, I've read a ball fondler

273
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:43,190
comment 10, 20 minutes ago. It was a different, it was a different account. Why are there like five

274
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:55,420
of you? I'm so confused. It's not the same person. It's a different account. These are fake accounts.

275
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:03,750
We'll just ban them all. Do we just ban any type? If you, if your name has ball fondler in it,

276
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:12,170
like you're just gone. It's just like, just not allowed on this stream. That's funny.

277
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:27,659
Everyone but the OG gets banned. That's funny. Somebody said, stop giving attention to these

278
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:37,800
people. Yeah. You know what? That's also right. That's also a correct statement too. Okay.

279
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:55,670
You can craft weapons now. All right. Wrap up the day and let's go. Yeah. Let's go do it.

280
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:10,300
Ban the false fondlers. I did nothing good, sir. Yeah. Yeah. That's debatable. That's debatable,

281
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:21,619
but no. Okay. All right. Who with a high taste score will increase customer satisfaction. He's

282
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:31,300
innocent. All right. Let me check the menu. What can I do? Level one. I can enhance it. Hold on.

283
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:42,780
What's the most expensive thing I have Mediterranean parrot fish and I can make it better with what do

284
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:51,500
I have? How do I make it better? Do I have to pay? But I have to give fish to make it better. What

285
00:55:51,500 --> 00:56:09,590
am I losing by doing this? I'm losing three fish VIP ball fondler. So you know who the real one is.

286
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:13,989
I don't want to VIP ball fondler. I feel like that would all of a sudden ball fondler would

287
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:22,199
have like a massive ego trip. I think. No, that's not happening. I think we would get ball fondler

288
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:30,500
being like, do you know who I am type of scenarios? We're not having that here. It says Mr. Ego.

289
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:52,659
This is my channel. This is my stream. It says Mr. Ego. That's so funny. Do you have any idea

290
00:56:52,659 --> 00:57:05,219
who he is? Yeah. I know who he is. This one can be enhanced. All right. I only have one of these.

291
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:26,619
So let's do the expensive items first. I only have one. These are, these are all right. Wait,

292
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:43,000
is this going to kill somebody? You guys said this was poisonous. Whatever. You only have four

293
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:51,500
sushi for sale. Well, I'm just trying to get to a hundred bucks. I'll be all right. Green tea. I

294
00:57:51,500 --> 00:58:11,320
got you right here. Almost perfect for. Oh yeah. Okay. Now I know that that's the fake one. That's

295
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:16,840
okay. Now I know that's the fake one. A ball fondler account just said, Hey, give me 20 bucks.

296
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:33,750
All right. That's now I know you're absolutely not the real one. Somebody said, I want 20 bucks too.

297
00:58:37,800 --> 00:59:18,219
Oh man. Yeah. Please be careful. Me too. Me too. I wanted to don't get tricked by any fake ball

298
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:23,719
fondler accounts, please. Or even from the real one. Don't you know what I'm saying? Like just be

299
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:54,440
diligent. 55. He tricked you into a six month of one guy, but it was all right. You can't deny

300
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:03,340
that the original ball fondler arc was not really funny. You can't deny that. It was.

301
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:22,119
Nobody can deny that. Okay. So we did the repair. I'm Dr. Bacon. I'm an archaeologist who studies

302
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:27,480
the sea people civilization, the sea people. I'll explain it to you. Aren't you lucky to have an

303
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:51,909
expert like me tell you about it? Okay. They worshiped fish and had gills allowing them to

304
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:55,750
live underwater. They live in the depths, allowing them to flourish without any concern for invasions

305
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:00,409
by other civilizations. The sudden changes to the sea bottom brought about their abrupt downfall.

306
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:08,940
About all there is. Everyone thinks it's a myth and nothing more, of course. The proof that they

307
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:19,530
were real was found right in the vicinity of this place. An amazing find. A lot of people want me

308
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:25,050
to do a lot of different things here. Okay. My assistant closely analyzed an artifact found

309
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,699
nearby and found that it is from no known civilization. It's dated to around 1500 years

310
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:37,320
ago as well. There were no civilizations in these parts back then. That's interesting. What business

311
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:43,260
do you have with me? Well, you see, my assistant's cryptocurrency investments didn't pan out and he

312
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:49,429
won't be around for a good while. That's why I'd like you to help me. My assistant told me that

313
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:56,099
the artifact was found 70 meters or so below the surface. Please go take a look. We're busy with the

314
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:01,880
sushi bar. I don't think we can. Sorry to interrupt the conversation. I'm Cobra. I work with Dave.

315
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:08,440
Of course we should help you. We'll gladly do so. What? We don't have time for this.

316
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,099
Swim around. Look for artifacts. Think about it. If an underwater civilization is discovered,

317
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:19,940
countless people will flock here. Bancho sushi will be bursting at the seams. What was that?

318
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,380
You have a point. All right, I'll help. Isn't that lucky? Of course. I won't be asking you to work

319
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:31,340
for free. I'll upgrade the diving suit you're wearing for free. With an enhanced diving suit,

320
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:36,949
you'll be able to venture deeper. This is essential for exploration. These days,

321
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:42,230
even such things can be handled by an app. Technological advancements are amazing, eh?

322
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:46,019
Let's first install the iDiver app on the phone before we proceed.

323
01:02:47,139 --> 01:03:03,099
Okay, so you can upgrade. I love upgrades. I have a question for the chat. I love upgrades.

324
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:12,219
If there's a game where the oxygen tank is level one and you can get it to level 20,

325
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:24,380
what is the best one that I have not played? That's not a question. You had needed to wait

326
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:34,809
for two or three sentences to come up. What is like an unbelievable upgrade game? People say in

327
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:42,329
Subnautica. Really? I feel like I played Subnautica. Is that like an upgrade game? I love upgrades,

328
01:03:42,730 --> 01:04:02,360
just to start timing these people up permanently for one minute. Upgrades! Upgrades! You all love

329
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:09,079
upgrades. These games sell like crazy and it's because you like to see the number go a little

330
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:28,440
higher every few minutes. I still need that starfish. Stardew Valley. Yeah, Stardew Valley. I've

331
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:46,699
played it a lot though. What's this one? Uh, idle games? Yeah, I've played a lot of them.

332
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:57,690
Factorio. I feel like I'm not smart enough to play Factorio. Factorio to me just kind of seemed

333
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:09,860
this is a lot of information that I don't know. Graveyard Keeper has a lot. I'm dumb as bricks

334
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:23,769
and it's fun. Maybe I'll check it out. The game you are playing right now, dude. All right,

335
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:33,989
I'm into it. Hey guys, give me like a good game that has a bunch of upgrades and it's like really

336
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:40,090
fun. It's like tons of stuff to do and good things to collect. Yeah, I think I don't think

337
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:45,099
I'll play this game again. What I'm playing right now. Yeah, I'm maybe like I'll try it like later.

338
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:55,960
It's like it's this one. All right, wait, what did I just get? Basic rifle, triple axle. This is worse

339
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:13,980
than what I have on. Metroid. Oh, sorry. I've been sitting here silently. So how does it work? Oh,

340
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:42,170
it's a gun. So wait, do I just, how much are these worth? If I, yeah, yeah, yeah. It is like Red Dead,

341
01:06:42,170 --> 01:07:06,550
isn't it? This is definitely like Red Dead. I can destroy the meat, right? 100%. I need one of those

342
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:21,019
tanks. What's this? Ammo box. Orange juice just went up my nose. Stop making me laugh. Wait, you

343
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:52,150
just, you just distracted me and got me. You know, hold on. I'm gonna die. Swimming fat. I can't get

344
01:07:52,150 --> 01:08:12,099
the pot right now. Try Ilona. You actually brought them back. I guess I expected too little of you.

345
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:20,890
This should do for now. Here's a reward. $70. Five olive oils and five soy sauce.

346
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,619
Animal Crossing is that game. Yeah, I have a really shit take that all of you are going to be mad

347
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:46,340
about, but I just, I have a lot of trouble getting into Animal Crossing because every time I've ever

348
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:53,460
played Animal, I play it at like two o'clock in the morning every single time and it works on real time.

349
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,899
So when I'm lying in bed, it's like, oh yeah, let me check on Animal Crossing. It's like 2 a.m.

350
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:05,699
every day. It's just like, I can't really even do anything. And then it's like, well, just change

351
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:11,220
the clock on your Wii or on your Switch. And it's like, I don't want to, I don't want to do that.

352
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:17,220
I don't want to go into my settings and change the clock a day forward, go back out of the menu,

353
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:25,020
go back into the game, reset the game and no, that is the solution. But then I forget about that and

354
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:41,859
it'll be like December, not time traveling. I would love an Animal Crossing, like Animal Crossing,

355
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:48,279
I would love an Animal Crossing colon game. Do you know what I mean? Like Animal Crossing colon,

356
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:55,109
let's get to it. And it's just, there's no time stuff. It's just, it's not like a main

357
01:09:55,109 --> 01:10:04,359
Animal Crossing game. You know what I'm saying? Animal Crossing colon, up and at them. And that,

358
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:07,880
they call it that. And it has the colon because it's a different game.

359
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:16,300
You guys don't know, you guys make fun of me for grammar. You guys don't, I'm a colon, semi-colon,

360
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:32,539
colon. Okay. You can decorate. That's cool. Animal Crossing colon, New Horizons.

361
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:42,020
They all have colons, don't they? Do they all have colons? Is it Animal Crossing colon?

362
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,479
What are they all? They have to be, right? Animal Crossing colon,

363
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,159
new leaf or something, right? Animal Crossing colon, New Horizons, Animal Crossing colon.

364
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:17,289
It's okay. That shows you how much I've played those games. When was the last time that they,

365
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:32,140
have they ever numbered Animal Crossing? No. Social media app? No, that would be silly.

366
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:46,170
I love the theory of Animal Crossing. It's a wonderful theory, but for me, I'm just so,

367
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:52,970
I play every game on my own time, not on stream after like 12 o'clock every day, midnight.

368
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:04,010
And then I'll look up stuff about, oh yeah, well, as long as you play

369
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:11,369
at 9 AM, this bug exists. And it's like, I, the first thing I do at 9 AM, I'm going to forget,

370
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,300
I'm not going to wake up and play Animal Crossing. I'm going to forget about that.

371
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:31,420
Ever since the Zoom beanies stream, I get mid-roll ads. Uh, you shouldn't be. I mean,

372
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:38,220
I'm not running them. Oh wait, hold on a second. Oh shit. I think you did probably get caught in the,

373
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:48,970
I did run an ad when I was like fucking with everybody. Um, apologize about that. Yeah.

374
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:54,409
It's possible that you joined right. And that right when I was doing that stupid, like,

375
01:12:54,409 --> 01:13:00,619
please play ad joke thing. Cause I think that's when I did that. But if that's not the case,

376
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:09,079
then I don't know. I'm not running them here. Hey, more customers will visit new foods would

377
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:39,079
be unlocked. 65, 65. I'll keep the one I have. All right. Now I got to go into the app and post

378
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:55,579
about the restaurant. I got to give it a like. Oh, I can do this. Rank up followers. I need 10

379
01:13:55,579 --> 01:14:27,619
followers. Should I just go through and like everything? Let's get the menu gone. I don't

380
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:36,869
know how to use social media. I just don't do it. I know how to use it, but I just don't.

381
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:51,579
I got three mid roll ads on the next best stream and one on this. I don't know what they're doing.

382
01:14:54,819 --> 01:15:00,760
Yeah. I'm I'll look in my dashboard and make sure I, cause I'm unless that's like automatically

383
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:24,199
happening. It shouldn't be. All right. Menu 20 bucks, 20 bucks. I got two of these now open.

384
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:32,840
What is this ingredients? Oh, I can sell these just as they are. That's cool.

385
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:51,430
Oh, cause you open at night. Should I sell some of this? Might as well. Just the stuff I'm not

386
01:15:51,430 --> 01:16:07,909
using. I'm not going to sell the condiments or anything though. Stop, stop, stop, stop,

387
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:26,970
stop. Don't sell. Don't sell. Don't sell. That actually a bad idea. Okay. Do you like the beach?

388
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:30,010
I do. I haven't been in a long time though, cause obviously where I live.

389
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:46,789
I'm going to try to go down deep. I'm not picking up any boxes or anything. It's all a beach where

390
01:16:46,789 --> 01:17:30,859
you live. Well, I mean, beach implies water. There is no water. Dolphin. Follow it. I'm not going to

391
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:59,159
shoot the dolphin with the harpoon for relax. A pink dolphin is caught in the net. You guys have

392
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:29,579
money. That's the noise I was waiting for that. I was waiting for that. A gift. Pearl. All right.

393
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:46,810
I got to go down to 70 meters. Wait, this is a, this is better. Yeah. Cause they don't, it doesn't

394
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:53,750
mess up the meter or anything. All right. Let's try that. Let me see. Oh, that's a great job.

395
01:18:53,750 --> 01:19:13,899
All right. Pick it up. How do I pick it up? There we go. Oh, this is a three star. I wonder,

396
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:33,539
is this fish expensive? Underwater scooter. That's actually good to have right now. All right. I'm

397
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:44,710
going to just try to go fast to the bottom. You need to get to 70. Uh, I have to go back up.

398
01:19:44,710 --> 01:20:18,470
Escape pod, escape pod. Let me get these fish here. Really drowning. I have 25. I'm all right

399
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:32,789
for now. This is an escape pod. Wait, this is not an escape pod. Okay. All right. All right. Right.

400
01:20:32,789 --> 01:20:59,239
Right. All right. I could have stayed down there a little longer. Okay. It's already evening. I feel

401
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:08,649
stiff. All right. I have a lot of materials. Play Assassin's Creed Black Flag. I made a video on

402
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:19,909
Assassin's Creed Black Flag like seven years ago. I don't know how good the video is, but I made it.

403
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:35,819
I don't really remember. It got an update. This is a food critic. This place is getting

404
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:42,180
popular on cook stuff. The name gave me pause, but to think it's really your place. New food

405
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:47,750
using ever-before-seen ingredients. Can't taste this anywhere else. Did they mention me too?

406
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:55,300
No, not really. Brings you all the way here. Want to check out the restaurant. Looks like

407
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:01,449
you're still the same. Okay. You refused to listen to me last time in a similar fashion,

408
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:09,060
and that's what got you booted from the hotel. Talking about that again. It's the customer's

409
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:16,310
fault for judging the food without even trying it. Who was the shit character from the Black Flag

410
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:30,619
video that ended up in the rumble? I, wait, you're pulling out a memory here. I don't know. Those of

411
01:22:30,619 --> 01:22:37,109
that don't know, there was a tradition on this channel on YouTube and on Twitch up until pretty

412
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:43,850
recently where I would, over the course of a year, every character that was kind of meaningful

413
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:50,090
in any game or any kind of joke, they would all fight in a rumble at the end of the year.

414
01:22:54,140 --> 01:23:00,680
And sometimes those characters, it'd be like 20, 30, 40 of them sometimes. And it was like,

415
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:07,050
I always wanted a lot. So it's like, wait, who can I even, who could I even have pull from? What

416
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:12,090
game did I play this last year? And sometimes you had to dig pretty deep. And that's how you get

417
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:16,890
like the random captain from Assassin's Creed Black Flag. It's like, oh, I guess that guy,

418
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:21,859
like somebody thought that guy was funny for a minute. So sometimes you have to really dig deep,

419
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:34,949
find characters for the rumble, but they're always fun. Every serpent. Yeah, that was the,

420
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:42,119
that was the filler arc for the rumble, I think was all seven serpents from,

421
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:50,180
when sorcery, when I first did sorcery, half of the entire roster of the rumble was sorcery

422
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:56,760
characters. So many, I think it was a half the rumble and then all the planets. Yeah,

423
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:04,039
I had to dig deep on that one. You're just not going to do them ever again.

424
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:14,170
No, I think what happened was the games got kind of like, like the 2K games,

425
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:20,489
it had like this crazy creation suite back in like the early 2010s into the mid 2010s.

426
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:29,510
And then it just kind of became less like goofy and more kind of simulation based. And it's just

427
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:34,789
like, okay. And then after a while, you kind of you've done it enough times, you kind of the same

428
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:38,949
joke, start repeating over and over again. It's like, all right, that was fun. It needs to be

429
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:53,720
fresh for me to want to do it again, I think. What about the live rumble? Yeah, that's, that's been

430
01:24:53,720 --> 01:25:01,699
floating around for a long time. It has been floating around for years at this point, besides

431
01:25:01,699 --> 01:25:09,289
the one that I did on YouTube. I'll find a way to make it fresh. And the, the wrestling,

432
01:25:09,289 --> 01:25:22,649
wrestling empire was sort of just like fun to play and mess around in. Okay, please get me a

433
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:45,859
white tip reef shark head and olive oil. Shark? Okay, get a shark head and need a gun. I already

434
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:57,460
have one, don't I? Sometimes special customers with a backstory will hear of the sushi bar and

435
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:07,159
visit. Learn dishes that the customers want through research and serve them to the customers, okay.

436
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:25,539
You can now research new recipes. Use the artisan's flame. Artisan's flame research.

437
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:35,029
The head of a white reef shark that's been deep fried whole. I only have eight of these.

438
01:26:45,819 --> 01:27:18,949
53. Geez, okay. What's the menu look like? Looks pretty good. What can I get here today? I don't

439
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:27,109
have a shark head. Didn't you just watch us talk about how I don't have that? I thought you were

440
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:59,819
a vegan furry. I'm leaving. Perfect four, watch this. Perfect four, watch this. Vegan furry.

441
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:05,289
What was that again? I misread what somebody wrote in the chat. I don't remember.

442
01:28:05,289 --> 01:28:29,909
I'd like to come again. Nice. Somebody said very funny. Ah, that's what it was. Very funny. Yeah,

443
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:34,630
I got kind of like all twisted up about it. I was like, what are you talking about? Like,

444
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:38,300
what the fuck are you talking about? Why are you saying that to me? And they were just giving me

445
01:28:38,300 --> 01:29:14,260
a compliment. How do I misread it so much? Chat moves really fast, okay. There's a new post?

446
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:24,359
Should I make a post? I don't know. Do I really? I don't want to be the guy that likes every single

447
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:34,170
post from everyone, right? Or do I? You know why I don't like to be that guy? Why I don't want to

448
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:40,039
be that guy? Because if you don't do it, if I didn't, like let's say Glenn came in and I didn't do

449
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:43,880
it to Glenn. Like I just didn't do it one day, but I did it for everyone else. That kind of makes me

450
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:51,859
look like a shithead, doesn't it? Like, oh, why didn't they like my post? I saw you liked Luna's

451
01:29:51,859 --> 01:30:03,380
post and CCJY's post and Rose Pink post, but you didn't, you didn't like mine. That's overthinking

452
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:13,300
it. I don't think so. Overthinking social media. Social media is a fucked up place. What do you

453
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:28,460
mean overthinking social media? Wait, do these people? All right, let's just call Dr. Bacon.

454
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:52,420
Do you have the mini game app? Where's the mini game app? What? I don't have any games. Wait,

455
01:30:52,420 --> 01:31:05,100
where is my? Oh, there it is. Okay. I definitely want this. Cargo box. I think that's what I want

456
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:26,329
first. Upgrades, upgrades. I'd love upgrades. Dr. Bacon is my goat. What would you do if the

457
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:41,449
internet disappeared? Find something else to fucking do. I need to go down to 70 meters. I

458
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:56,680
keep not doing this. Goofy hammer? Rubber toy hammer. It doesn't do much damage, but

459
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:12,569
sometimes I put him to sleep. Whoa. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

460
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:17,899
Leave me the fuck alone. I need to pick this thing up. What's going on? You piece of shit.

461
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:32,420
I cannot believe what just happened. Leave me alone. What do you mean? No. What? I can't pick

462
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:54,729
it up. Gold or something. What is this? Dinosaur bones? All right. I'm almost at 70. There's

463
01:32:54,729 --> 01:33:40,710
oxygen right here. Holy shit. I got lead. Should I be touching this? Okay. We're good. All right.

464
01:33:40,710 --> 01:34:14,939
I got to go down to 70 and look for artifacts. This might be one right here. Text in my mother

465
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:22,739
and I'm done. All right. I'm ready to go. What was that just now? To go back to the boat. What?

466
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:39,260
Is that? He thinks he's a funny guy. Well, I need to get rid of it. Should I attack this? I have a

467
01:34:39,260 --> 01:35:39,939
gun. There's some weird animals in the ocean. I got to get some ingredients. What's that? What's

468
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:51,399
that? All right. I got to go now. Get the big one. I can't. I need like a submarine or something.

469
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:31,430
You can just kill the big one. What's your Twitch? Twitch.tv slash. So what do I unlock for this?

470
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:39,779
Okay. I'll be in touch. Can you link your Twitch? I don't know how to do that though.

471
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:54,329
I think there's like a way to copy text and paste it. Magic. All right. I think I have enough.

472
01:36:59,829 --> 01:37:11,750
New character. Hopity hop. You do know a lot about this giant blue hole. Okay.

473
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:22,140
Is the best place to collect? Marinka? Marinka. Trading cards. Marinka.

474
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:30,140
Uteristic trading cards that utilize an AI recognition system that automatically

475
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:37,800
corresponds to fish in real life. Never heard of it. You seem quite behind. Let me help you

476
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:44,680
install the app. Do this. Do this. Do this. Done. Done. All right. All right. You don't really need

477
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,840
to do anything special. Just catch a new fish and you'll get a card. Check the cards every now and

478
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:56,140
then on the app and you're done. Okay. You don't want to be saying the name. I understand. I'll

479
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:14,090
try it out. I'm Sato. All right. Cool. Marine cards. Fancy your cards for catching higher grade fish.

480
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:28,939
I got a lot of money. I'm going to upgrade the gun because look at how much more damage that is.

481
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:59,079
It's ridiculous. I used all my money but it was worth it. I love upgrades. I really do. So what's

482
01:38:59,079 --> 01:39:12,310
an expensive fish of these? I guess I could just look. I should just get as many as I can really.

483
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:32,649
What about a seahorse? I don't want to kill the seahorse. Is that weird? Oh I can't even.

484
01:39:32,649 --> 01:40:11,960
There we go. These are expensive. Iron. These red fish they have a lot of utilization. Damn it.

485
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:41,939
Damn it. I'm playing with a controller so that's my excuse. Oxygen capsule. That's helpful.

486
01:40:48,390 --> 01:41:05,100
Lightning harpoon. Harpoon tip charged with high voltage. Chain damage. Does that not work? Whoa

487
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:30,840
what's happening? Whoa. This must be shocking things around. Oh hold on. I'm running out of uh

488
01:41:30,840 --> 01:42:02,779
I gotta go up. Will I keep this oxygen capsule till later if I can make it all the way up? What

489
01:42:02,779 --> 01:42:28,340
do I have to get rid of? I don't want rope. This thing is I mean it's all right. It weighs a lot.

490
01:42:28,420 --> 01:43:09,779
Eh whatever. What if you sneeze underwater like this? Excuse me. Yes it was real. I should make

491
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:40,140
some good money. This dude just sneezed for attention. That's a wild sentence. That is an

492
01:43:40,140 --> 01:44:08,739
insane sentence. Level three. Let's upgrade. Pretty much upgrade everything. Upgrade again.

493
01:44:08,739 --> 01:45:00,939
Upgrade everything. What is omega lull? It means happy birthday. It's usually somebody's birthday.

494
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:14,149
They're saying happy birthday too. A lot of birthdays today. You really had to dig for that

495
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:27,369
one. It's a um it means uh it means uh happy birthday. See there would be a cut there. This

496
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:39,510
is live. We're live. It would be like what's omega lull? Well happy birthday. He just didn't get the

497
01:45:39,510 --> 01:46:27,560
audio cut and that's all right. That tea is chunky. Yeah it is. Lean quick. How's the progress on the

498
01:46:27,560 --> 01:47:00,460
video you're making? Steady. Steady. We got new food. Kitchen staff. Is this video 10 years in

499
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:17,029
the making? Not really. When it comes out you'll know but we'll do a premiere. I made a lot more

500
01:47:17,029 --> 01:47:29,189
money today. Can you do an impression of German985? I could try. I don't know him that well but let me

501
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:38,539
see. Hey I mean what about the aliens? Just aliens? How do we even tell the aliens that we're people?

502
01:47:38,539 --> 01:47:50,069
How can we possibly describe electricity to the aliens? He kind of talks like that doesn't he?

503
01:47:50,069 --> 01:48:01,939
That's not bad. He's not really close. I don't fucking know the guy. You're acting like I know

504
01:48:01,939 --> 01:48:09,210
this guy. One off the cuff message from chat and I'm just trying to... I don't know this person.

505
01:48:10,939 --> 01:48:31,239
Oh I got a radar. Your voice wasn't nasally enough? Nasally? Do I have a nasally voice? No I don't do

506
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:41,270
I? My voice is not nasally. Nasally. You mean nasally like this? Like that? Like this? I don't

507
01:48:41,270 --> 01:49:05,189
have a nasally voice. How do we tell him? Let's test the radar. His voice is way milkier than that.

508
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:34,979
I know. I agree. He doesn't have... he didn't do the velvety buttery voice that he had. Buttery. I don't

509
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:45,399
like when voices are described as buttery. He's like stop. He's got a smooth buttery voice. Butter?

510
01:49:45,399 --> 01:49:51,659
I only want it on fucking toast. Stop. Everywhere else. Unless it's like for you know obviously

511
01:49:51,659 --> 01:50:22,569
just don't make butter a description for talking is what I mean. Oh the dolphin again. Again? Pirates

512
01:50:22,569 --> 01:50:35,770
must have captured it illegally. Somebody just shot me with a gun. Who just shot me? Some people

513
01:50:35,770 --> 01:51:17,659
are shooting at me. They'll shoot back. What's up bro? Oh I can't. Fuck you. Fuck you. What did you

514
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:39,850
say? Morgan Freeman voice. I wish I could have it on repeat. It's always the same thing.

515
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:50,329
I could probably speak dolphin. If you put me with some dolphins and I was just like

516
01:51:52,949 --> 01:52:02,939
I would get viciously fucking murdered and it would rip out my eyes and eat all my organs and shit.

517
01:52:02,939 --> 01:52:32,520
Gold bar. That's pretty huge. I want to find something new. This is kind of new. Have I had

518
01:52:32,520 --> 01:53:00,090
a pinkfish before? A sea goldie. Can you make a real dolphin noise? Blueprint. Nice. That's a big

519
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:12,600
deal. I need to get a shark. How deep do I have to go for a shark? Nice. All right find a shark.

520
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:52,630
That's not a shark is it? No. That's a salmon. These things have a lot of health. Hey salmon

521
01:53:53,189 --> 01:54:22,470
mackerel. Don't bite me. I thought it was gonna bite me. Well now I want that. Give me this. Indeed

522
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:36,500
this is my award-winning restaurant. My accolades. All right I gotta go up. Not before I pick up this

523
01:54:36,500 --> 01:55:00,729
though. Why is he doing the pac-man confused thing from the pac-man game? Look. Look. I can't drop

524
01:55:00,729 --> 01:55:46,100
anything. I just gotta go. Dave is going to die. Dave is gonna be fine. You're in the ocean?

525
01:55:46,100 --> 01:56:00,500
Pirates? Sharks usually are near the surface. I'll check it out after this. What is that pac-man

526
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:06,020
game called? That's right. Pac-man like the new adventures or something right? Super Nintendo is

527
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:18,039
a side scrolling game. It was bizarre. It's a game where you had to tell pac-man to go you had to

528
01:56:18,039 --> 01:56:26,329
control him with voice commands from a narrator and he was just sort of this weird childlike wonder

529
01:56:26,329 --> 01:56:34,600
where he would walk around just look at stuff and he would get really distracted. Be like pac-man go

530
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:40,039
right and he would just be like and he would just go look at a butterfly. It was a really bizarre

531
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:46,090
game. I made a video on it but maybe one day I would stream it because it's so strange. I feel

532
01:56:46,090 --> 01:57:06,310
like everyone needs to see it. Okay looking for a shark. I have a gun. Check the right side is what

533
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:34,329
people were saying. I couldn't swim down to what the radar is pointing me to. Uh that's way better.

534
01:57:34,329 --> 01:57:58,460
It was from your what the fuck series. Pretty good one. It's copper? Okay cool. These are heavy

535
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:30,340
though. I don't want it. All right where's this shark? Olive oil. How long can you hold your breath?

536
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:50,039
Um probably not as short as you think. Two seconds. I mean I don't really care to try.

537
01:58:50,039 --> 01:59:06,420
What's the average? What's the average? Average you know adult male that whatever what's like the

538
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:30,739
average? 30 you know let's say 35 year old. One to two minutes. This thing looks kind of this

539
01:59:30,739 --> 01:59:42,779
thing's glowing isn't it? 30 to 90 seconds. There's a difference to me of holding my breath underwater

540
01:59:42,779 --> 01:59:49,529
versus holding my breath just sitting here. I feel like I can hold it for much longer in

541
01:59:50,090 --> 02:00:00,729
water. Does that make sense? Is there any scientific reason for that? All right I went

542
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:18,220
all the way right. I don't see a shark. That's an actual thing. I'm gonna pick this up and then go

543
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:38,569
down. Although I do want these sell for a lot. The hell just happened? Underwater you're not absorbing

544
02:00:38,569 --> 02:00:55,100
any oxygen through the skin. That's not correct. I don't think that's correct. Why did I think

545
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:29,739
that was real for one second? Shock shock shock. This is mine. All right I gotta get up. I guess I

546
02:01:29,739 --> 02:01:40,939
could get some of these. Hold on. I'm just going right up here anyways. What about the jellyfish?

547
02:01:40,939 --> 02:02:04,220
That's one star. I didn't use a gun. Plenty of factors like pressure movement and exertion

548
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:07,659
and energy. Free diving or other types of swimming. Also depending on the amount of

549
02:02:07,659 --> 02:02:15,960
oxygen percentages you take in. Hey just got here. Can you please tell me to fuck off? Thanks in

550
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:44,659
advance. Get the fuck out of here. I like the sniper rifle. We got a good menu tonight. This

551
02:02:44,659 --> 02:03:31,989
is gonna be good. I bet I could do 60 seconds. Salt grilled. Oh this is a good one. 48 coins.

552
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:53,340
Let's do them all. Those things are so easy to get to. Okay so what can I do now? What do we got?

553
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:59,699
This one. This one is going on the menu because that's what the food critic wants.

554
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:33,060
I'm not gonna upgrade it. Okay salt. Where did I get salt? From the ocean? I calculated based on

555
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:37,460
your height and body weight and other factors. It is impossible for you to hold your breath for

556
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:49,479
60 seconds. You're smart chatter. You are tapping into insecurities of mine. Prove without me doing

557
02:04:49,479 --> 02:04:55,699
it. That I can't do that. So like I calculated based on your height and like your weight and

558
02:04:55,699 --> 02:05:01,930
everything. Oh you must have calculated it. All right bro. I'll prove you wrong. I know it's a

559
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:18,170
very good attempt. A really good attempt because you think oh well fuck you. I'm gonna go on full

560
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:39,239
cam and hold my breath till I turn fucking purple. Like no I'm not gonna do that. Yeah I don't think

561
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:45,130
I would have very much fun holding my breath as long as I could. No I'm just like playing Dave

562
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:50,600
the Diver you know. I'm just kind of hanging out. I don't think I want to hold my breath.

563
02:05:50,600 --> 02:06:19,859
There's a lot of people here. Disgusting as usual. Apparently not disgusting. Yeah don't hold your

564
02:06:19,859 --> 02:06:28,060
breath. Breathe. Don't be an idiot. Don't be stupid. All right I'm gonna hold my breath as long. Don't

565
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:49,590
do that. Don't be stupid. She really likes it. It is lovely. The book of five rings states that one

566
02:06:49,590 --> 02:07:03,319
should look at the essence of something instead of its appearance. Okay you pass. Just pretend

567
02:07:03,319 --> 02:07:14,680
you're holding your breath. How would chat even know? We mean go on cam and take a big

568
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:19,479
and puff my cheeks out but I'm just breathing through my nose the whole time.

569
02:07:20,279 --> 02:07:34,489
I have a counter going in the corner. I'm just being like

570
02:07:37,539 --> 02:07:52,569
like trying to communicate every such dog shit. How long can I hold my breath? Take a phone call

571
02:07:57,979 --> 02:08:03,020
and do the thing where it's like yeah sorry man. I really gotta go. I gotta go. I'm doing

572
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:16,460
a thing on stream. I gotta go. Then puff the cheeks out again. Just do it without a face cam.

573
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:19,659
All right you guys ready? Time me. How long can I hold my breath for? You ready?

574
02:08:30,699 --> 02:08:33,659
Oh that had to be like a minute. How long was that?

575
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:47,270
Jeez. How long was that? 10 seconds. That's gotta be a record.

576
02:08:49,590 --> 02:09:01,989
You just take a screenshot of your face with your cheeks puffed out and closing your nose

577
02:09:01,989 --> 02:09:10,470
with a timer going like hey I'm doing it right now. How long can I hold my breath? I'm still

578
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:19,619
talking over the stream. That doesn't make any sense. I am going for and right going for world

579
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:36,039
record. Play in silence. Oh I really wish I had clothing on. I wish I had a shirt on right now

580
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:45,689
and I am fucking gross. I oh man I have to like I haven't I like feel kind of like shit too.

581
02:09:45,689 --> 02:09:55,689
Like this is not the day. All right save this. I promise I will do this on the next stream. Wait

582
02:09:55,689 --> 02:10:01,500
the next stream is going to be the house flipper invitational joke thing. Maybe I'll just do it on

583
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:08,739
there and just everyone will think I'm a weirdo. We already have a screenshot. Wait why do you

584
02:10:08,739 --> 02:10:23,130
all I hate this picture though. Okay anyone else? It's this one could do it. This image does not

585
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:38,699
convey I'm holding my breath. This is I'm holding in laughter. Oh that thing was so funny but I

586
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:45,619
can't laugh because then I'll lose. No that's not holding my breath. That's you laugh you lose.

587
02:10:46,260 --> 02:11:40,229
I like this one. This one's so stupid. How long can I hold my breath for? I can't. I can't. It's

588
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:51,510
not even close. I am wicked red and this one is fucked. Okay this is definitely the one.

589
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:53,739
This is absolutely the one. Okay so then no hold on. Okay I need it needs to be a timer. Hold on

590
02:12:53,739 --> 02:13:23,670
hold on a second. Let me get a timer. Okay stopwatch. Well no no not it needs to be yeah like

591
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:53,529
this. This is okay I like it though. Okay hold on. Is this one? No not that one. There it is. We got

592
02:13:53,529 --> 02:14:14,069
to prepare this. It's very important. Okay I'm just cropping it so you can see it better.

593
02:14:14,069 --> 02:15:02,010
All right you ready? All right I'm going for it. See how long I can do it for.

594
02:16:57,819 --> 02:17:11,110
What's up? Yeah I'm in the middle of streaming. Yeah I'll call you in like a couple hours. All

595
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:52,280
right dude. All right yeah I'm streaming. Bye bye. Time what's that? 241 come on. And a phone call

596
02:17:52,280 --> 02:18:16,459
in the middle. Yeah that was funny. That's literally nothing. That's a lot if I were to actually

597
02:18:16,459 --> 02:18:20,700
do it. Don't try that at home by the way. You can actually hurt yourself doing that. Don't fuck

598
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:26,180
around. It's a funny bit but don't fuck around. It's actually kind of dangerous to do that to

599
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:42,860
yourself. All right I need it. Whoa it's all right. Okay mom. I just want to make sure people

600
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:58,629
understand that. Okay if that makes me mom then that makes me mom. But I'm gonna say it. Okay

601
02:18:58,629 --> 02:19:10,889
mom. Look at it and all this is all ruined now. No it's the most expensive thing on the menu.

602
02:19:10,889 --> 02:19:16,809
Oh but it's right here. It's right here. No no I just it's like when somebody's like towing

603
02:19:16,809 --> 02:19:28,659
your car and you like walk out you're just like I'm fucking right here. God damn it. Who even

604
02:19:28,659 --> 02:19:44,120
ordered this? Who ordered this? Why did he make this? Oh my god. It's because we did a little

605
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:52,870
routine. I had it up the whole time. There was a little routine we did. All right you can't say

606
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:58,229
that that's oh he's so bad. He's so bad. I literally stopped in the middle of that to do a I'm going

607
02:19:58,229 --> 02:20:19,399
for the breath world record joke. Can I guess where this is from? This is this is from WarioWare

608
02:20:19,399 --> 02:20:36,100
isn't it? This is a I'm mad at WarioWare face. Is that wrong? Rhythm heaven. Yep okay same kind

609
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:59,780
of genre. Yeah same genre. You were holding your breath the whole Wario stream. Nah you really are

610
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:13,620
impossible. Blue shells and brown shells. I can't understand your underlying anatomy in this picture.

611
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:30,659
What is your neck doing? Um well like we can examine it if you want. So that's that's my chin.

612
02:21:30,659 --> 02:21:40,819
It's not my neck. This is where my face kind of ends but there's more face. That is really strange

613
02:21:40,819 --> 02:21:52,889
looking isn't it? This is my chin. That's the bottom of my chin. See I have created a second

614
02:21:52,889 --> 02:22:00,170
face on top of my face. That's gotta be worth something right? That's gotta be worth something.

615
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:25,500
Like a turtle going back into its shell. I might just do air twice. Oh I need 400. I'll save the

616
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:39,190
rest or can be crafted. Should I make this? Jerma you're wilding in the morning. I see why you

617
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:47,059
stream later. I feel like I've been pretty chilled out and kind of low key this stream. What do you

618
02:22:47,059 --> 02:22:55,719
mean? I think I've been like kind of relaxing this whole time. This is a this is a little more

619
02:22:55,719 --> 02:23:03,180
toned uh like dialed down like toned down. Should I make this? I already have one don't I?

620
02:23:03,819 --> 02:23:16,780
You ever gonna go back to Final Fantasy 16? I want to but I think I'm gonna um think I'm just gonna

621
02:23:16,780 --> 02:23:30,469
stream it. I'm gonna play it on my own time. Stream it on my own time? I don't know. Should

622
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:53,079
I have crafted that? I will. I was looking forward to it. I haven't completely ruled it out. Just

623
02:23:53,879 --> 02:23:58,809
not uh there's like just other things that for instance the next time I'm streaming is

624
02:23:58,809 --> 02:24:12,659
Monday and that's the house flipper invitational stream. So it would have to be after that. Oh a

625
02:24:12,659 --> 02:24:16,760
lot of people weren't here. I could talk about it again. Actually let me go over a few really

626
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:21,719
important things because I think a lot of people trickled in over the last hour or two. Um in like

627
02:24:21,719 --> 02:24:31,510
30 minutes or so we are going to raid uh Sea Dog Connor's stream. Connor is doing a charity auction

628
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:43,100
stream today and I have two different bundles in the event. Two Grotto Beast themed items bundles.

629
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:54,069
One of them's a raffle. One of them's an auction. That is where you are going. It's all benefiting

630
02:24:54,069 --> 02:25:04,309
the Immune Deficiency Foundation. It's a lot of items. I'm not the only one. There is I believe

631
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:10,180
dozens and dozens and dozens of items from different streamers and youtubers that are going

632
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:20,180
up for auction and raffle. And I think the raffle my raffle my item I think is going to be pretty

633
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:33,049
early in the show. So make sure you go check that out. It's not the face mold. I told you no one's

634
02:25:33,049 --> 02:25:41,129
getting that. In fact I I might just destroy it. It's really possible that I just destroy it because

635
02:25:41,129 --> 02:25:47,899
it's like nobody can have this. It's just too just far too powerful of an object. I might just crush

636
02:25:47,979 --> 02:26:00,819
it. You know what I mean? Like I know but that can't exist. But that's what's happening today.

637
02:26:02,809 --> 02:26:11,909
Go support that stream regardless if there's items of mine that are in it. If you got some time

638
02:26:11,909 --> 02:26:22,780
please support it. Also on Monday July 3rd we're doing a house flipper invitational

639
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:31,340
joke. It is not like actually officially endorsed by anything. Um just me and I got rewards for this.

640
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:41,049
Uh yeah so I'm gonna I'm trying to get like somewhere between five and ten streamers. I've

641
02:26:41,049 --> 02:26:51,000
already reached out to a bunch of people already. We're gonna do a house flipper flip off where

642
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,479
everybody gets about 60 to 90 minutes. Everyone starts at the same time and everyone starts at

643
02:26:55,479 --> 02:27:04,760
the same house. And then it's pencils down give me a tour now of your house. And I'm going to be

644
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:11,860
grading them on creativity, complexity, philosophy, theming, structural integrity, cleanliness. I have

645
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:31,899
an entire system and there is the object I need right there. Explain philosophy. Your design

646
02:27:31,899 --> 02:27:50,440
philosophy. This is my grading system okay. You make your own grading system. Yeah there's a few

647
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:58,200
more people I'm going to reach out to this weekend. Tonight and tomorrow. I think it's going to be a

648
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:05,719
really fun time. I think it's going to be just jokey fun. Not going to be too serious. Just to

649
02:28:05,719 --> 02:28:22,700
have some fun. What are you going to stream on your end? Dave the Diva. Now I'll probably

650
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:30,489
hang out in house flipper and sort of make my own maybe. Or just kind of be chilling out painting

651
02:28:30,489 --> 02:28:55,719
walls. Yeah I am those of you that know me and those that have been you know invited or will

652
02:28:55,719 --> 02:29:04,620
be invited. Why can I not catch this? There's a specific criteria that you should probably be

653
02:29:04,620 --> 02:29:09,750
following. I'm not going to tell you how to make your house or anything but I cannot catch this

654
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:29,370
long time. I'm still contemplating if I want theming right. I give like a couple of words.

655
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:32,409
Let's just say I'm not going to use these because I don't want to you know this is not a leak.

656
02:29:32,409 --> 02:29:38,940
Well let's just say that it was like okay and you're here at your house and your words are

657
02:29:39,659 --> 02:29:49,610
sunshine dog food and pickles. What does that mean? You tell me. You tell me what that means.

658
02:29:49,610 --> 02:30:09,670
That's a leak. No it's not. I'm not going to use those. I need one more blue shell and we're good

659
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:36,180
but I don't think I can get it. What brand of dog food did you have for breakfast today?

660
02:30:42,649 --> 02:30:55,750
I actually had a coffee and that was it as of right now. I want to go deeper. No more this you

661
02:30:55,750 --> 02:31:03,579
know like 50 meters candy. I want to go down to like 150. That's not breakfast dude eat something.

662
02:31:03,579 --> 02:31:08,200
I usually do. I usually do. I usually do. I'll be all right don't worry. It's been like two hours

663
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:20,309
three hours. I usually will have some kefir. If you're a long time viewer of this channel you know

664
02:31:20,309 --> 02:31:34,940
that kefir is a drink that I very much enjoy. He's always loved kefir. Of course I have. A very

665
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:43,059
great thing to consume. Good for you. Doesn't have any really like bullshit in it for your digestive

666
02:31:43,059 --> 02:32:00,149
track. I need that now. You ever have peach flavored? I like blueberry kefir myself. Too

667
02:32:00,149 --> 02:32:13,909
much kefir will cause kidney stones. Uh you're not you're not gonna be one of those people that's

668
02:32:13,909 --> 02:32:19,700
like hey you know that if you eat too many apples it gives you you know fucking diarrhea. I'm not

669
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:26,489
gonna eat 10 apples. You said you love apples. I do like apples. Well but you you you must eat

670
02:32:26,489 --> 02:32:32,040
three every day. I don't. Well why'd you say that then? You don't love apples then. I do.

671
02:32:32,040 --> 02:33:11,190
Well then you must eat 10 a day. I don't. Do you think I can take them? That hurt a lot. God damn

672
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:36,059
it. Oh he's gonna cut me with it. Oh shit. What? Oh my god I have to get out of here right now.

673
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:49,290
Just eat this. Eat it. Eat it quick. We're good. You're back here. The wuss running away and that's

674
02:33:49,290 --> 02:34:11,739
I got a shark meat but I love kefir. Oh you do? Improve it then. Drink a whole kefir right now.

675
02:34:11,739 --> 02:34:18,020
It's really good. I promise. Does it actually give you kidney stones? Is that person full shit?

676
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:39,129
Bullshit. It has to be. It's yogurt. It's yogurt adjacent. It's a yogurt cousin. It's not.

677
02:34:39,129 --> 02:34:58,389
It's yogurt. Research level gained. Eco watcher. Mission based app made to protect the environment.

678
02:34:59,030 --> 02:35:02,149
You get points for completing missions on the app and get rewards for reaching certain levels.

679
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:18,659
This was for points on the app not for a paper. Oh dear. Dude kefir is a treatment for kidney stones.

680
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:24,979
There's a lot of just misinformation in this chat right now. I need a verified source. It can't just

681
02:35:24,979 --> 02:35:42,280
be like fucking like Greg. Kefir kidney stones. I need to see what's going on here. It's good.

682
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:47,049
It's good for you. Don't listen to anybody. It literally helps with that. It helps with that.

683
02:35:54,659 --> 02:36:09,059
WebMD Wilson. I don't know. Do you trust like bill from the subway or WebMD? I don't know. Which one

684
02:36:09,059 --> 02:36:24,059
of those do you choose? Kefir is good for you and will help alleviate some gut bacteria issues

685
02:36:24,059 --> 02:36:29,899
and is good for you and can help break up potential kidney stones. Hey that shit gives you kidney

686
02:36:29,899 --> 02:36:40,260
stones. Don't listen to that fucking idiot. That's a liar. I would trust a real doctor and not a

687
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:48,059
website but you can't make an appointment to the doctor. Call the doctor. You can't call the doctor

688
02:36:48,059 --> 02:36:51,819
and say hey doctor hi I'd like to have an appointment. Okay what are you coming in for?

689
02:36:51,819 --> 02:36:58,149
Well you see um I just want to ask you a question. What do you okay you you're having any symptoms?

690
02:36:58,149 --> 02:37:04,709
No I don't have any symptoms. What are you doing here? Well you see um do kefir cause kidney stones?

691
02:37:07,059 --> 02:37:13,620
No. Okay you feel okay? I feel great. Okay bye. That's not how you don't you can't make it a

692
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:24,620
you don't go to like urgent care to ask that question. That's what your primary care doctor

693
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:29,500
is for. Yeah when you have like a an appointment like a physical yeah go ahead ask it but to make

694
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:36,899
an appointment specifically to ask the doctor if like eating watermelon will give you gas.

695
02:37:36,899 --> 02:37:51,020
It's like I this this that's I don't think that's like a symptom. Getting a little scared of your

696
02:37:51,020 --> 02:38:05,190
kefir consumption levels hmm. The whom on the end of that is my favorite. Okay we need another

697
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:34,180
staff member. Kitchen or dining area probably dining area. Training to consider. This is a

698
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:38,100
lot deeper than I thought this was a game where you swim around and collect fish. This is much

699
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:58,489
deeper than I thought it was going to be. I like it 150 to train. Yeah let's do it. Not too much

700
02:38:58,489 --> 02:39:09,209
and not too little. Yeah do you guys honestly think the guy who has said Ben Franklin's name

701
02:39:09,209 --> 02:39:16,040
probably more than every twitch streamer on this website combined ever you think is gonna

702
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:38,760
argue for like over consuming something. Oh I got 10 of these. He's in hell that's fine he's in hell

703
02:39:38,760 --> 02:40:05,290
whatever whatever I what do you want to say. This dude takes advice from hell dwellers. A hell

704
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:17,670
dweller that's an interesting term. Hell dweller. All right this thing is look at the money I'm

705
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:42,010
gonna get from this. I gotta stop picking these up they're not worth anything anymore. I like the

706
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:47,780
way your earlobes stick out. Have a great stream. Hey thanks. First time chatter first thing you

707
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:54,309
ever said. Actually thank you. That's a good that's a compliment. Usually the first time chatters

708
02:40:54,309 --> 02:41:00,760
say hey are you that guy that did X. Are you are you that guy that did this. I'm not even playing

709
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:07,079
the fucking game anymore. Like you see what's going on. Are you the sus guy. Are you the guy

710
02:41:07,079 --> 02:41:24,299
that did X. You guys did Y. Right like are you that guy. I hate that guy. Somebody where's the

711
02:41:24,299 --> 02:41:30,250
I should have put the person in the kitchen because I I don't know there's not enough food

712
02:41:30,250 --> 02:41:58,200
to go around. There's not enough food to go around. He can't cook it fast enough. By the way don't I

713
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:08,360
have a staff member. What is going on. Where are they. Thank you. Thank you. Actually nice job.

714
02:42:11,049 --> 02:42:36,540
Staff is asking for a raise. I have to return to that game one one day. It's been long enough I

715
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:44,569
think. I'm afraid to play Casino Inc because I feel like that's it's like the peak of my entire

716
02:42:44,649 --> 02:42:54,329
Twitch career was how much fun I had in that game and I'm scared that I'll go back and taint it.

717
02:42:54,329 --> 02:42:58,489
It almost lives as this perfect memory in my brain that I kind of don't want to mess with it.

718
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:19,450
Management app which works on your smartphone. Sounds handy.

719
02:43:22,819 --> 02:43:48,329
Management app. All these apps. I think we're doing pretty good. Can never be replicated again. The

720
02:43:48,329 --> 02:43:52,250
fire happening after waiting for it was the best build up and payoff that can never be replicated.

721
02:43:52,250 --> 02:44:01,899
Yeah yeah at some point you know when you're doing a sequel you're just kind of grasping for that how

722
02:44:01,899 --> 02:44:08,020
much fun you had and the sequel is just kind of like it was okay. We kind of remembered some of

723
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:18,899
the funny things. It's kind of funny because that's like my worst enemy is not wanting to do things

724
02:44:18,899 --> 02:44:28,899
more than once. A lot of the shows and like events and stuff that you've seen I was just like no I

725
02:44:28,899 --> 02:44:32,790
don't want to do this again like I want to do something else and it's kind of a detriment

726
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:39,319
because it's like well would you ever want to do like six or ten episodes of that and I'm just like

727
02:44:39,319 --> 02:44:54,299
no not really and it's kind of a detriment sometimes. Can I get this now? That was sad.

728
02:44:54,299 --> 02:45:03,430
That was really sad. I just shot this fish in the fucking head. That was like sad. That was kind of

729
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:22,379
sad. Am I poisoned? All right I'm going down deeper. I get bored incredibly easily

730
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:29,260
so and plus I don't know I feel like there's other ideas I like and I want to do. I feel like each

731
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:38,950
thing that I do is fun to have it live sort of in a little bubble on its own. It's typically how I

732
02:45:38,950 --> 02:46:27,340
feel and this thing is aggressive. Do not please don't. Barracuda. I want a squid. I don't think

733
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:42,010
I've even found one of these yet. Yeah is Connor's stream live right now or is it starting soon?

734
02:46:42,010 --> 02:46:53,860
10 minutes? Yeah. Again if you don't know what's going on in 10 minutes I'm going to dump you all

735
02:46:53,860 --> 02:47:01,350
over on SeaDog on Connor's channel. There's a whole big charity auction stream going on today.

736
02:47:01,350 --> 02:47:08,809
I have a couple of items that are included. One bundle is for the auction. One bundle is for a

737
02:47:08,809 --> 02:47:25,159
raffle. So I believe they're doing my raffle bundle pretty early I think on the uh in the show. All

738
02:47:25,159 --> 02:47:44,200
right last one and I'm gonna go. I feel like this game is for Marvel nerds? Marvel nerds? What do

739
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:53,020
you mean why are you truing that? Marvel nerds? I think it's just a fun game about diving in the

740
02:47:53,020 --> 02:48:10,329
ocean and collecting fish and stuff. Where are you getting that from? Activate? These are mines.

741
02:48:10,329 --> 02:48:22,860
All right I actually I gotta go up. I might be in trouble. Is this the ceiling? Hurry hurry hurry.

742
02:48:22,860 --> 02:49:13,780
It's kind of rude. Like what? It just exploded. That's like I'm fine. I mean dude what are you

743
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:32,059
doing? What are you doing? I'm fine. I have a escape pod right there. Before you raid Connor

744
02:49:32,059 --> 02:49:47,739
can you just get a DMCA strike? What is stop? All right I think they're about to start. Is the

745
02:49:47,739 --> 02:49:55,829
countdown still there? Let me check. 10 minutes? 5 minutes? Is there enough to do one um one uh

746
02:49:55,829 --> 02:50:04,620
restaurant evening? Six minutes? Oh let's let's yeah let's get you over there. I don't want to

747
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:14,090
be late. You need to do one stream that deserves a sequel is a kill the meme stream. I talked about

748
02:50:14,090 --> 02:50:26,379
that six months ago. All right guys go say hello to Connor. A couple of grotto beast related items

749
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:40,379
bundles are available for raffle and for auction. Please go support it. We'll see you again. Let me

750
02:50:40,379 --> 02:50:51,860
just get this set up. Yeah everything supports the immune deficiency foundation so go hang out. I'm

751
02:50:51,860 --> 02:51:00,549
very curious how some of these items do especially the auction ones. Yeah I'll see you guys on Monday

752
02:51:00,549 --> 02:51:07,770
house flipper competition with a bunch of streamers. Should be a good time. I'll be in offline chat

753
02:51:08,729 --> 02:51:14,170
probably on Sunday night giving some more details or just show up on Monday 4 o'clock pacific.

754
02:51:14,729 --> 02:51:40,700
Sounds good. All right see you later. Take care. Have a great night. Ta ta for now. We can do this

755
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:53,590

756
02:51:53,590 --> 02:52:11,399

759
02:52:41,639 --> 02:52:53,049
week but it's okay. I'll be goodbye Monday. And don't trust me I'm fine. It's just some minor

760
02:52:53,049 --> 02:53:13,659
annoyances. I'm good. See you later. Goodbye. Yeah it's stomach related if you're curious. I'm good.

761
02:53:13,659 --> 02:53:17,379
Intestinal. I'm good. See you later.
