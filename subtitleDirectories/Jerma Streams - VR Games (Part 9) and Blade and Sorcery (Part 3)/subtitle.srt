1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:09,189
You're my iPad, Mayo, and Wine THG tensed stream featuring Krabby Patty and Fortnite Mobile.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:18,489
That's me. I'm that guy. I'm your guy. Somebody wrote that. I didn't just say that.

3
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:23,940
No one said that. Yeah, like 30 people did. Hey, destroy dude. Thanks for the five. Give me 30 subs.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:31,980
Right off the bat here. Welcome back, everybody. We're going to continue our trek through VR.

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,460
We are not going to play Half-Life Alex today. That is reserved for tomorrow and Tuesday.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,740
I'm hoping to get through Half-Life Alex either tomorrow or Tuesday. I've heard it's about a 10

7
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,899
to 15 hour long experience thinking maybe three streams will do it. Maybe. One of the scary games.

8
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:04,099
I have like at least five scary VR games downloaded. We'll get to them. Wait till...

9
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:11,959
It's not Halloween yet. Wait till at least like the week of Halloween. I don't do like October

10
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,430
every day is a scary day. When is Chubby Bunny? That's going to happen next week.

11
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:26,200
Fucking Chubby Bunny. Patience is a virtue. Yeah. Hey, the Fooly. Thanks for the five.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,760
Give me 30 subs. He's a liar, liar, liar. I'm not a liar. Look, you... I'm not... And by the way,

13
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,599
people think I'm going to die if I do Chubby Bunny. I'm not going to do Chubby Bunny until I die.

14
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:46,409
I don't know why you think that's going to happen. I'm going to do like seven marshmallows and then

15
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:58,420
we're going to call it a day. I'm not going to die. Chubby Bunny is going to put him in a wheelchair.

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:08,180
That's not going to happen, dude. But for now, we have a few games I want to go through.

17
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:21,180
Very importantly, the main thing today is The Room VR. I made a video like seven years ago

18
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,939
about The Room. It's one of my favorite series. And I'm not even kidding. It's an iPad series.

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,039
Hold on. Don't be such a dick yet. It's on Steam. They ported it to Steam like three or four years

20
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:42,500
ago. It's this like box inside of a box inside of a box puzzle game. It's so much fun. They made a

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,919
VR version of it. And it's not just a VR version of the first game. Or, oh yeah, we like slapped

22
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:55,319
some goggles on you and we gave you hands. No, it's a completely from the ground up VR game

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,560
experience. So fuck yeah, that's what we're doing today. But before that,

24
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,860
I think that's at least a couple hours. We're going to do some just VR fucking bacon wrapped cheese,

25
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,759
bacon wrapped scallops. Fucking Resident Sleevers. It's been four minutes, dude.

26
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:24,740
You can't show up to the concert. And they're like just before the concert music is playing.

27
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:34,419
All right, what's the lineup today? Oh, we got Blink-182. We got Kanye. And the main event

28
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:42,069
is Skrillex. And it's like, oh nice. Okay, I can't wait. I'm at the concert now.

29
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,849
Oh, this is boring. Turn off this like before the concert music. Where's Skrillex? That's what I'm

30
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,689
here for. I don't want to sit here for four hours and wait for Skrillex. Get them on now.

31
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,099
That's true. You don't resident sleeper at a concert. If you resident sleeper at a concert,

32
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:11,560
you may have the wrong choice of music. Start the stream. I need my crack.

33
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:23,139
This guy sucks. This music sucks. Song sucks. Honey, how much were these seats?

34
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:34,550
They were $180 a piece. Oh, you like this music? No, you do. I'm just humoring you by coming to a

35
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,569
concert that you wanted to go to. But don't you think this guy sucks? Yeah, actually I do.

36
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:47,290
But you're the one that listens to it in the car every day. Yeah, but I mean, I mean, this concert

37
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:59,449
sucks. All right, let's go. That's wrong. This is a true story. He's projecting. He didn't think

38
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:06,060
you're going to see me show up right now, did you? Oh shit, hold on. And I got the VR guys on camera

39
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,620
shirt and I got one of these. We ain't fucking around today, boys and girls. I ain't fucking

40
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:27,240
around today. I am protecting my hair today. He's got a dirty shirt. You know, okay, you guys know

41
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:36,980
that time has passed since the last stream, right? This is not like 12 hours after the last stream,

42
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:46,259
just because the last stream happened. I've washed this by hand. How do they even take this off?

43
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,629
And dude, you know something weird about headbands? I feel like that blood is being

44
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:57,079
constricted to my brain. I hate these. I feel like it takes longer for me to say sentences right now.

45
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:09,899
Is that weird? It kind of feels weird. All right, let's go. First up is Taphouse VR. This is just a

46
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,550
meme game we're going to play for like a half an hour. Why am I holding this like I'm videotaping

47
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,629
you at like a wedding? Okay, okay, now go in and kiss, go in and kiss each other. Yep, yep, yep,

48
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,470
oh my god. Yeah, that looks great. I'll be back about 40 or 50 more times during the course of

49
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:44,699
the wedding to annoy the fuck out of you. Stop harassing the bridesmaids. I'm going in. Can you

50
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:52,980
guys hear this? No, you can't. Isn't that what you did? I was paid to be there. They paid me to be

51
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:02,899
annoying. And look, all right, I know, I know. Look, I gotta address this. Yes, we are getting into like

52
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:09,209
fat germa arc. I know, I know, I know you can see this because I can see it. You know, I know you

53
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:17,610
can. I've gained like fucking 20 pounds since the last time you saw me on camera. I'm strong and I

54
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,689
can like rest shit on there now. My iPad, like when I'm lying down, my iPad can just sit right there

55
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:32,620
and I just go like this and I like I just sit there and I like I play Hearthstone, right? I play

56
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,500
Hearthstone and then in a little window in the corner is like preparing and playing Hearthstone.

57
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:46,060
It's awesome. I can't even see what the fuck he's doing. I just like having it on. I got the picture

58
00:07:46,060 --> 00:08:08,540
in picture. Stonebod. Here comes the bad boy arc. Why would that be a bad boy arc? Wait, are we

59
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,779
talking like bad boy? Like I took cookies out of the jar and it was like, get away from there.

60
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:30,100
Or like I ride a motorcycle. Which one? Both. All right, let's go. This is Taphouse VR.

61
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:42,299
Why am I already wicked hot? It shouldn't be like this, dude. Dude, they need like an AC unit in here.

62
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:52,620
You know when like a mascot has a fucking costume on? Valve, get on that. Now the headband's in the

63
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,809
fucking way. All right, I'm good. At least it's protecting the hair. I don't want to lose that

64
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:12,090
shit because I will. All right, I'm in a good place. There you are. All right, how do I play?

65
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:24,970
How do you play? Oh, okay. Normal, bold, collected, drink serve, drink accuracy,

66
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,289
dead customers. I thought that was somebody coming in my actual room. Dead customers.

67
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:44,580
Wait, there's a slot machine? I don't even know how to play. Are these like triplets?

68
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:56,419
What does he want? He wants gnarly juice, cranberry flavor. Can I punch him in the face? No,

69
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:02,899
don't do that yet. Cranberry juice. Oh, here we go. Okay, that was a monitor. That was a monitor.

70
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:11,509
All right, cranberry juice. You got it. Here you go. How much do you want?

71
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:26,700
You get to take the whole thing. What's that? What's that? Why is he like doing like,

72
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:37,139
do you want a beer? Everyone else notice that every VR game is based around like pouring

73
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:43,879
drinks into glasses and then throwing the glass at the guy's face. All right, you want 50%

74
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:53,580
Spropa bar. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Do I have this shit? What's Spropa bar? It's just make

75
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,899
a mess. VR. Make a fucking mess. And you don't have to clean it up. That's the big selling point.

76
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:11,059
Okay, Spropa bar energy drink. Okay, we got gnarly juice. Got it. The right one. No, it's the wrong

77
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:33,320
one. Here we go. And then milk. Oh, all right. What do you want? You want one in the curved glass.

78
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:41,399
Okay, I got it. Gnarly juice. 60% gnarly juice. You got it. That's like 60, right? And then you want

79
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:54,139
20% rum, 20% milk. All right, it's my first day. 10% milk, 20% milk, and then 20% rum with some rum.

80
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,779
Okay, that's it. Here you go. Let me move that for you, sir. We're at 100%. Yeah, that's good.

81
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:21,799
How do I take these? I want to play the slot machine. Hey, I can't. I can't get that one.

82
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:32,139
Can you hand that to me, please? You want a lazy schmo? What? Lazy schmo? You want a bucket of

83
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:51,529
lazy schmo? What the fuck is? Okay, here you go. Good, right? Holy shit, that was a lot of money.

84
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:14,700
Fuck, what was that? Give me this fucking money. Excuse me. He just wants rum.

85
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:19,940
Didn't I just give you a drink? All right, you want just you want rum in a martini glass?

86
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:31,779
Where are the martini glass? Oh, shit. Hold on a minute. Let me in here, man. Let me in here.

87
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:37,700
Where are the martini? Where are their glasses? The martini glass? I don't know. We don't have

88
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:47,370
any. We don't have any martini glasses. Fuck off, dude. This is the wrong bar. All right. What do

89
00:13:47,370 --> 00:14:13,320
you want? Want 80%? Beer and vodka? That's fucking kind of gross. Vodka. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

90
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:26,470
I'm sorry. This beer is never ending. They all leave together? Not good.

91
00:14:28,659 --> 00:15:02,740
Customers. Here we go. Clean. There we go. All right. Where's the martini glass?

92
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:24,059
What do you want? Go fast. Tap water. That's it. Oh, what do you want? Did that get his attention?

93
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:48,659
What do you want? I want one of these. One what? Okay. And what? 20%? Oh, so vodka. Here you go.

94
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:03,419
What do you want? Order up. Martini. Fuck. Martini. Milk in a martini glass? What's wrong with you?

95
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,460
Milk in a martini. I don't have any. Where are they? Guys, help me. Up left. Oh my god. I'm

96
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:23,019
fucking oblivious. Milk in a martini glass. Here you go. Wake up. That'll be $12, please.

97
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:38,809
Break it. What the fuck are you doing? Break it. What the fuck am I hitting?

98
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:48,740
Do you want? One second. Why do I have my own slot machine here? This is the stupidest thing ever.

99
00:16:49,539 --> 00:17:04,759
All right. Hey, switch those machines. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Superbar. There we go.

100
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:16,890
You pay the big bucks for that. I want to play. Give me this. I mean, if you own this place,

101
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,799
this employee is just paying you back. You don't even have to pay this guy. This money is just

102
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:30,710
going right back into the restaurant. Oh my god. It's going to go over, isn't it? Okay. Seriously.

103
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:42,250
Is it tipping over? Is it falling? I don't know. I'm a diamond. Bring the shelf down. No.

104
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:57,720
All right. 20%. I got two minutes. I'm good. How does somebody die in here? I don't know. How

105
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:14,329
do you die? Can you imagine leaving a bar? All right. What do you want? I don't know what the

106
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,369
dead customer thing is supposed to mean. All right. What do you want? That's your thing.

107
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:29,880
You know what? Just take it. Just take it. Take the bottle. Take it. Here. How's that for a beer?

108
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:53,210
It's MaxBit. All right. Watch out. Watch out. I don't want to hit anything.

109
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:11,059
Okay. I'm already hitting something, but I'm busy, sir. Oh yeah. Do you want? Here. I got you, dude.

110
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:17,460
All right. You want the Superbar. Is there anything else happen in this game?

111
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:36,180
Oh, I don't understand. Like how somebody's a dead angry customer.

112
00:19:38,170 --> 00:20:10,970
They got power. Yes. All right. So now I got a D plus again. How? Inbox. I'll play Saw 2.

113
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:24,859
No, I got an action packed game coming up next. I'm trying to see what happens if I...

114
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:46,680
Wait a minute. Hold on. I can't do anything. Next game.

115
00:20:48,680 --> 00:21:10,900
Give them the wrong order. Okay. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Take it. Here. Here.

116
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:26,700
Okay. Yeah. Let's get around a fireball. Yeah. Oh, I love doing this shit. I love when 30 of you

117
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,460
come in and ask for fucking around a fireball. Yeah. Make sure I get all of you. You in the back

118
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,619
too. Fireball for you too. Sure thing. Sure thing. Now I gotta go in the back and I gotta

119
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:44,059
get another bottle of this shit so that I can make you fucking idiots happy. Yeah. Sure thing.

120
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,140
Oh, what's that? Oh, half of you didn't even come get it because half of you didn't even

121
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:57,019
fucking want it in the first place. Two of you wanted this. 12 of you didn't. Okay. That's a lot

122
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:02,220
of fun. Being a bartender with a bunch of dickheads. Oh, we all love that, don't we?

123
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:22,740
Real world experience. It's... It's zingy. I feel like I'm in an airplane bathroom. Where am I? Why

124
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:35,750
am I so... Why am I hitting the same wall so many times? They've got Skrillex. Okay. I'm gonna go

125
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,180
to the next one. That was kind of fun. That was pretty fun. That was fun. Wasn't it? I thought

126
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,940
it was pretty cool. Come on for a sec. Oh, this is... Why the fuck did I get over here?

127
00:22:51,190 --> 00:23:04,099
Skrillex waiting room. I already won the slots. All right. Give me one sec. That was fun. Okay. I

128
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:14,329
forget the next game. What was it? Oh, right, right. It was Hell... Hell... Hell Road VR. Right. Now I

129
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:33,029
remember. No. Okay. Hold on. Let me get it up. A long drive. It's called Hell Road. You ride a

130
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:42,579
motorcycle. It looks intense as hell. I missed some subs here. We had a five from Donut. Thank

131
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:49,589
you, Donut. And then $50 from Zurich Da. 5,000 bits to say love you, big man. Thanks a lot, dude.

132
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:57,980
That's a shitload of money. That's an extreme amount of money. I'll take it and I will spend it

133
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:15,349
the worst possible way. Okay. Let's get this up. And here we go. Should be able to see now.

134
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:28,150
There you go. Okay. What does it want me to do? Re-center. Hold on. Re-center your view until the

135
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,269
windows are in the correct position. Press R to reload. Press enter to finish calibration.

136
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:46,490
Holy shit. Dude. I got, you know... I haven't even done it in VR. When you sit on a couch and you

137
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,970
have a pretend like 5,000 foot screen, that's what this is. I'm at like a movie theater right now.

138
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:59,369
This is a seated experience. What? Okay. Press R to reload window positions. I'm gonna press R.

139
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:14,539
Does it really matter? Good. Press enter to finish or toggle edit mode with VR controllers.

140
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,119
Sit. Seat comfortably. Please seat comfortable in the chair and activate both VR controllers.

141
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,990
Oh, this is good. This is fine. So, but how do I get the... I press enter.

142
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:46,329
I'm ready. You ready? I can stand up on the bike. I'll be fine. Both controllers are activated.

143
00:25:46,329 --> 00:26:12,859
How am I going home? Oh, how do we go home? It crashed? Game crashed? How did it crash?

144
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:26,539
How does a game like that crash? Why does it want me to host a Minecraft room?

145
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,660
Because I wasn't sitting down. Well, what the... All right. I am now.

146
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:50,660
Try this again. I'm clearly sitting now. Okay. Okay. That's good. See. Here we go.

147
00:26:52,579 --> 00:27:08,519
All right. I'm sitting. This is a seated experience. I think it crashed again.

148
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:17,849
All right. Well, we're not playing that one, I guess. That was... That one looked fucking really

149
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:23,079
cool too. That's unfortunate. Well, we've got a whole shitload, so it doesn't really matter.

150
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:32,279
Oh. Oh, fuck yeah. You ready for this shit? Are you ready for me to prove to you guys once

151
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:53,829
and for all what I fucking can do? I hope so. Let's go. Oh yeah. Time to show you how to play

152
00:27:53,829 --> 00:28:03,880
the drums. Everybody thought I was a liar. I'm about to prove to everybody that I can fucking

153
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:12,819
play the drums for real. We'll see you. Ah, that crashed too, didn't it? Fuck. How did that crash?

154
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:29,769
VR is just... VR was just never ready for us. All right. Here we go. He's got a virus? No, I've

155
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:51,349
reinstalled my entire fucking operating system. I don't have a virus. Okay. That's better. What the

156
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:56,630
fuck happened to you guys? Why? Okay. Why did fucking a stupid motorcycle game fuck this all up?

157
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:13,400
Fucking uninstall that piece of shit. Whatever. I'm only gonna play this for like 10 minutes

158
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:30,700
anyways and we're moving on to the next one. Okay. Let's go. All right. I lost chat now.

159
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:43,400
Bunch of horse shit. Uh, we're gonna do rocket. Oh, I can't wait for this shit. Don't even tell me

160
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:59,180
you crashed. Okay. Can you guys hear this? Where's the audio? What the fuck did that game do to my

161
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:21,220
computer? I gotta... Hold on. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta reboot SteamVR. Fucking pile of shit.

162
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:33,849
Virus stream. Yeah, it's called... It took over SteamVR, broke my whole computer, and then deleted

163
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:48,980
my audio. How much was that fucking game? Hold on. Give me a second. Let's... Searching. Yeah, yeah,

164
00:30:48,980 --> 00:31:01,210
yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know. Reboot this shit. Write a negative review on Steam. No. I didn't

165
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:11,539
get a chance to play it. Okay. Here we go. Everybody relax. I'm gonna calm down. Not gonna be upset

166
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:16,900
about this. We don't get upset about things that we don't. We have no control over. Right, Jeremy?

167
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:36,680
Okay. Very nice. I can... Why can't you guys hear this? What the fuck? Yeah, it says... It's the

168
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,980
Vive. It should be coming through the Vive right now. There we go. All right. I got it, I got it,

169
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:58,539
I got it. Fucking VR. Drum Beats VR. There it is. Let's fucking go, man. Killing me here.

170
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:29,500
There we are. Fucking killing me. Okay, can you see me? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

171
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:42,170
Fuck. Such like a production to do this shit. You gotta have like eight programs open for VR to be

172
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:52,809
streamable. No, just have like four windows open and download like six fucking mods. It's easy.

173
00:32:52,809 --> 00:33:01,579
It's easy. All right. I better be able to see you guys. I'm not gonna be fucking mad as hell.

174
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,299
Oh, this whole, this whole thing is fucking broken. Now I can't even see the goddamn chat.

175
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:16,200
That's fucking, that's phenomenal. Oh, what is this? Would 0.2% of people own this shit?

176
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:46,839
Whatever. I have to, I'm gonna play. Why are you not showing up? I'll fix this later. I don't even

177
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:57,369
need to see chat right now. All right. There it is. Wait, I don't have a foot. I don't have a foot.

178
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:13,590
How do I do that? Oh, this is weird without a foot. This is weird without a foot. This is weird

179
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:26,329
without, I can't do, I have to do with my fingers. I can't do it. I can't, I thought I'd be seating.

180
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:41,510
You know, do you know how fucking weird it is to have to do the foot pedal with your

181
00:34:41,510 --> 00:35:31,369
finger? In the fucking rim. What the fuck was that? I wish I had a fucking foot pedal.

182
00:35:31,369 --> 00:36:06,409
My VR just crashed. Why was I just on a, why was I just on a fucking iceberg? In high school,

183
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:13,289
that like is so ready to show the family reunion him play the drums. And he's kind of nervous

184
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:18,409
because he's like, I've never played in front of a crowd before. And then the whole family sit there

185
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:25,610
while he does that. And it's like, oh, it's like kind of fucking bad junior, but like it was good

186
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,489
enough for us to like clap and be like, okay, now let's wait. Where's the fucking carved turkey?

187
00:36:37,510 --> 00:37:03,719
I need a foot pedal and I need real. That's doesn't even fucking work when I press the button.

188
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:12,280
Why? Can I like put that on my toe? I can't even see you guys. You got a fucking motorcycle game.

189
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:41,960
Fucked it all up. All right. That's good enough. I don't care. That's good enough. I don't care.

190
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,559
That's good enough. That's good enough. That's good enough. I clapped at my high school fucking

191
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:59,739
party. I don't care. Wait, was it small this whole time? God damn it. Why the fuck is this

192
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:14,340
happening? Why can't I see you two? You two? What do you mean you two? There are more than two of

193
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:24,150
you here. All right. We're going to move on to, oh dear. I don't even know if I can play this one

194
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:37,980
right now. I did want to check out Blade and Sorcery's new content. I heard there was new

195
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:48,699
shit in here. So give me one second while I fix the chat. I'll be right back. Fucking motorcycle

196
00:38:48,699 --> 00:42:07,590
game. I swear to God. Fucking motorcycles. Fuck. Oh my fucking God. Fuck. Fucking motorcycle game

197
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:34,980
sucks. I'm going to fucking piss my pants. Okay. We're good. You guys ready for some more fucking

198
00:42:34,980 --> 00:43:09,349
VR? No. God damn it, man. I heard you playing. Yeah, I mean, I was trying to fix the chat.

199
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,519
Every like, every like 25 seconds probably was said like, fucking stupid fucking thing sucks.

200
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:33,750
I just was trying to get the chat on. He was rehearsing secretly. Okay. Well, that sure was

201
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:53,349
a fucking blast now, wasn't it? I want to play the Blade and Sorcery update. Oh God, what the fuck

202
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:24,579
have I done now? We're good. It only took like fucking 20 years. It only took 20 fucking years.

203
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:38,739
Don't ever fucking buy that motorcycle game. Donate your money to charity instead.

204
00:44:39,300 --> 00:45:14,070
All right, let's go. He grew in size. All right, so what's the update? All right, let's go.

205
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:29,849
There's an update apparently. Magic. What's that? I think I've got to play the game. All right,

206
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:39,369
let's go. There's armor now? Is there really? Who's the destination? All right, so is this

207
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:55,000
new destinations too? We've got arena, canyon. I've seen the canyon. Ruins. Zinado? First they're on

208
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:14,010
screen. Virtual reality. Virtual reality. Settle down. All right, we're okay. Fucking okay. What

209
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:33,179
have we not seen? No. And he's new. He's going mental. I'll just try one. Whatever.

210
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:49,159
Actually losing it. I was fine until I opened up a game and it deleted my whole computer. Why

211
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:58,039
does my arm feel like bigger? You know, I feel like my head is too close to my hands. Does that

212
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:04,710
make sense? I feel like I'm like this. All right, I want to see. I need any new weapons.

213
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:26,659
Yes. What's wrong with my hair? I do this, right? I lift it up and then how do you throw it, right?

214
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:50,039
How do you throw things? Stop. I'm getting sad. What are you talking about, dude? Wow. What?

215
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:04,460
Oh my God. Oh, the wind tunnel was sure was fun.

216
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:23,989
Fucking Mars attacks alien. Hold on a minute. Fuck man. Can I just get a break for a second?

217
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:30,409
What good fucking that fucking motorcycle came. Fuck that motorcycle came. Fucked up everything.

218
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:51,619
Count Dracula. All right, get me in here please. Get me please in here so I can start streaming

219
00:48:51,619 --> 00:49:07,980
the fucking video game. That's a literal Vegeta hair. Fuck. Dude, I can't. I can't right now. I

220
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,139
can't do that right now. We can't talk like this right now. Where are the weapons, dude?

221
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:36,280
What do you mean fight in progress? I need something. I don't have any fucking weapons.

222
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:50,469
I'm just being chased by a lady with a knife. Shit. What do I just activate?

223
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:42,039
Stay away from me. Stay away from me. I'm a psycho. My computer can't handle this.

224
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:57,219
My computer is lagging. I fucking had a computer lag. Wait, I know what to do. I know how to fix

225
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:05,480
that. I know how to fix that. I got it. Trust me. Don't worry. I'll fix it in a second. I know

226
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:31,449
what to do. Why did you hold this like this? I got you. I need to pause the game. I'm going to

227
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:51,300
pause the game. Pause the game for a second. I got to win. Don't do it. Don't do it.

228
00:51:52,679 --> 00:52:31,289
Don't do it. Don't do it. That's a mistake. Must destroy the humans. I'm going to fix the lag now.

229
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:42,940
Check this shit out. Ready? Lag's going to be gone in three, two, one. Check this out.

230
00:52:42,940 --> 00:53:09,929
Look at that. Lag is gone. Told you I was fucking capable of it. Fuck. Why am I so stupid? Okay.

231
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:22,519
How do I do the magic? It was a magic update? I thought I cut my finger off.

232
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:49,880
I was like, oh, that's great. Whatever. Hold down A button. They added a kick.

233
00:53:54,389 --> 00:54:08,840
Look at me. There's a kick. I need to get a person here to fight. I want to just sit down here and

234
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:20,840
just be like, come on and get me. Can I activate this stuff? I got to get this down. It's been a

235
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:44,860
while. Do you flick it, right? Or do you just push? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:54:45,739 --> 00:55:08,280
All right. Let's activate the next one. Die? I mean, that's really fucking far.

237
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:24,710
All right. Respawn. How do I respawn? Oh, why don't I? Didn't there a lightsaber mod?

238
00:55:25,349 --> 00:56:00,840
Can you do pogo like last time? I don't know. Oh, the storage. Wait, what's this? Oh, Jesus.

239
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:54,150
Oh, yeah. Where they at? Where they go? Didn't they run by me? Holy shit. He was waiting for me.

240
00:56:54,150 --> 00:57:29,139
Can I take that? Hello, come get me. Where the hell is everybody? All right. Let's wily

241
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:41,590
coyote this guy. Oh, no. Oh, shit. Wait, did I get wily coyoted? Oh, no. This is when the thing

242
00:57:41,590 --> 00:59:10,039
falls and I go. Give me this. Oh, get him. Wait, can I like strangle people? Get him. Fuck.

243
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:43,059
I hate you motherfucker. Where'd that guy go? Oh, here's somebody. Give me the fucking sword.

244
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:57,739
Holy shit. She's fall down the stairs. They pull the fucking bows and arrows.

245
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:27,050
Why is it lagging? And why can't I keep this in my ear? It's lagging so bad. Shoot. Come here.

246
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:46,760
Come here. Listen. Listen to me. You got to stay in school. You got to study every day. Look at me.

247
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,760
You don't want to end up like this. You don't want to end up in constant fucking war.

248
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:59,579
Look at me. You can't even look at your dear old dad anymore. You got to fight for how many

249
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,619
voice cracks are going to happen here in the next 20 seconds. Don't look. Don't look at him. Don't.

250
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:12,059
Let me tell you one last thing before I go.

251
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:17,320
Reef case with all the money in it. You'll never fucking know.

252
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:47,719
Ow. Oh, shit. It's coming in grease. Where's Kevin McAllister? He greased up the ladder.

253
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:55,400
Honey, what's the kick button? What's the kick button?

254
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:31,739
Get away from me. Get away. I'm going on the slide. No. Mom. Mom. Get out of here. It's my turn.

255
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:43,320
Get away from me. I want to kick him in the face so bad.

256
01:02:43,320 --> 01:03:39,349
Oh, my God. I can't, dude. Go up here. Go up. Go up. Go up. Go up. What is this? I don't know

257
01:03:39,349 --> 01:04:06,150
what this is. Where am I? How did I get behind the ladder? What? They left. Oh, my God. My fucking

258
01:04:06,150 --> 01:05:00,579
stomach hurts. Hear that? Hello? My computer's lagging so bad. Ow. Come here. Put that down.

259
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:30,969
Put that down. Put that down. Put that down. Oops. Give me that. Give me that. Holy shit.

260
01:05:31,610 --> 01:06:47,500
No arrow. Yeah. It didn't work. Ew. Yucky. Why is my game lagging? What's with all the lag, man?

261
01:06:47,500 --> 01:07:10,250
Any bodies? Turn the graphics down? I can't. I turned down some of the lighting. Did that help?

262
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:30,280
Oh, man. That was fucking so funny. F4. What do we got? Okay. Camera stabilization. I don't know.

263
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:49,829
Motion blur off. What was that? Alt F4. That's not going to do anything. Change the map. Okay.

264
01:07:49,829 --> 01:08:09,559
Change it in the game. Oh. I forgot how much fun this game actually was. Game is a joy. All right.

265
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:18,140
From... Oh, shit. That's my powers. This is the update. This is the update, isn't it?

266
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:41,939
Use magic and slow motion. All right. So, I have fire activated. How do I use the fire? Trigger.

267
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:54,100
What? Oh, my God. That's so cool. That's unbelievable. All right. I got to change

268
01:08:54,100 --> 01:09:14,329
the graphics. How do I get it? Let me change the graphics. Get the hell out of here. Handbook.

269
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:41,670
Button on the controller. The menu button. Wait. Oh, shit. Here we go. Custom resolution multiplier.

270
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:54,010
Motion smoothing. What is all this? Under resolution. Motion smoothing. Off. On. Oh,

271
01:09:54,010 --> 01:10:09,510
I lost you guys. That's not it. Wrong in-game book. Another in-game book? It'll write touchpad.

272
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:29,779
The menu button opens this. Menu button. The raid? Oh, shit. Who came in?

273
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:46,569
Incredible Orb is playing Basmophobia. I thought it was Incredible Orb raiding. I was like,

274
01:10:46,569 --> 01:11:05,930
how did that know? I can hold the camera of the right touchpad. I've hit every single button.

275
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:35,619
What the fuck is that? Menu. Oh, fuck. That scared the shit out of me. Who raided? Who raided?

276
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:48,060
Touchpad. Touchpad. Touchpad. Touchpad. I've hit every single button. Menu on left hand middle

277
01:11:48,060 --> 01:12:11,430
trackpad? I can't leave the fucking game. Right touchpad and left menu button. What the fuck is

278
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:41,770
that kind of combo? It's right trackpad and left menu button? Oh, god damn it. All right. Let's go

279
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:57,050
to the... I'm going to use these new powers. Who raided though? Who raided actually? The raid song?

280
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:10,939
Okay. Craig. Thanks, Craig. For the raid. Wherever you guys are, I can't really see you.

281
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:31,029
How about the raid song? Oh, yeah, of course. Everybody get to the battlements. We've got to

282
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:43,210
raid. We've got to... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where are we going? How about the canyon?

283
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:58,060
Sandler? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Thanks for the raid though. Seriously. Welcome, everybody.

284
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,859
We're going to play some VR today. I had a little bit of technical problems because I opened up a

285
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:14,420
fucking motorcycle game and it derailed the whole stream. I want... Yeah. You're going to... Oh,

286
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:34,949
okay. Let's go. You can do that. That's awesome. Unlimited power. Let me show you the true

287
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:46,300
power of the dark side. Oh, that's not supposed to happen. Oh, that's not supposed to happen at all.

288
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:52,699
Oh, I'm just an old fucking man without electricity. What? Why did that not work?

289
01:14:54,729 --> 01:15:02,810
Oh, I'm in trouble now. I can barely cross the fucking road on my own. Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot.

290
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:08,310
This is really not good, is it? Usually I laugh and they get scared.

291
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:24,890
I lost my... Give me that fucking shield. Give me that shield. That shield, you bastard.

292
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:43,800
I'm so scared I'm going to fucking hit something in my room.

293
01:15:43,800 --> 01:16:57,770
Okay. Oh, I'm running out of juice. Oh, I can't do it for much longer. Oh, boy. Anybody have an

294
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:36,010
iPhone charger? Dude, where do I get... Where do I get the fucking lightsabers? Is that just on

295
01:17:36,010 --> 01:18:27,300
Steam Workshop? Is that easy to get? Oh, it's not? Fuck. All right. I don't know. I'm breathing on

296
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:50,329
this. That's embarrassing. All right. Where's these graphics? Where's the graphics book? Okay.

297
01:18:50,329 --> 01:18:59,189
Here we go. Graphics. Render scale. I'm going to turn that down. Shadows. Mom. Character. Fast

298
01:18:59,189 --> 01:19:11,420
Gen. Character quality. Player. Whatever. NPC. I don't know. Impressions. Yeah. What was that?

299
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:40,380
Head drop. 0.75. Okay. Cool. All right, man. Let's go. Go to the market. Use magic on a weapon?

300
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:52,659
You can enchant a weapon? That's so cool. This might be the best VR game. It really might be.

301
01:19:53,300 --> 01:20:22,890
All right. What about like electricity on a weapon? An electricity mug? I'm playing the best one.

302
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,449
Yeah. We're going to get to Alex tomorrow. Actually, I want to see this. Let me look through this.

303
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:51,479
Onyx? Oh, dude. That's... Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I got to be Wolverine from you too. Just give me

304
01:20:51,479 --> 01:21:16,180
a weapon. Come on, bub. Okay. I like it so far. Let's go. Turn the trigger to pull.

305
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:59,399
Uh, fuck. Okay. Why can't I pick hard mode? T-Max alive. Totally. Oh. Oh, what the...

306
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:12,840
Circle of Death? Circle of Death. I don't know. More people playing games than I know, apparently.

307
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:24,020
Not allowed. Circle of Death. Where'd it go? Who's going to come in first?

308
01:22:24,739 --> 01:23:40,229
It's right in the fucking kidney. Is it alive? Right in both of his ears. Hear that? All right.

309
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:54,760
Get the... Get this off. Get this... What the fuck? Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

310
01:23:54,760 --> 01:24:32,329
Come here. Come here. Come here. Um, come here. Why did I just... You're an idiot. He slid his own

311
01:24:32,329 --> 01:25:26,760
throat. Now what? Back away. This exploded brain? Why is it so laggy? Which one would you like to die

312
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:34,060
by? Electricity, fire, or the force-exploded brain move? Which one? Yeah, I would have fixed

313
01:25:34,060 --> 01:26:10,840
fire too. I would have fixed fire too. I'm an avid evil guy in an anime, aren't I? What? Too much

314
01:26:10,840 --> 01:27:05,380
power. Too much power. Wow. Hey. You shut it off, you dick. Hey. Come here. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

315
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:30,729
How dare you? You get out of here. He's so... He's not dead.

316
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:54,149
He's just in a scoop for wine. Listen, Jampa. You'll get it, okay? He's... When he comes in the

317
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:58,310
ring, you don't start swinging, all right? Don't just go right in after the bell. What, are you

318
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:05,300
out of your mind? Come on, kid. You got this. I know you got this. Come on. Remember. Step, slide,

319
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:11,699
punch. Step, slide, punch. Stay with me. Step, slide, punch. That's right. Get out. Get in there.

320
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:42,380
Get in there and get him. How the fuck do you know what's going on? Okay, listen. Oh,

321
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:55,899
shit. What did I do? Is he all right? Back away. You're away. I got the champ here.

322
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:17,270
Grab their body parts with that spell. The garbage cards suck so bad.

323
01:29:17,829 --> 01:29:49,619
Does my computer suck? Combine spells? No, you cannot combine. That's just a shitty magic trick.

324
01:29:50,260 --> 01:30:21,779
I gotta drop the graphics even more. Oh, that looks so bad. Get the 3090 already? I would've

325
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:41,050
got the 3090, but they made like 15 of them. All right, what about this canyon? Find the purple one.

326
01:30:53,140 --> 01:31:35,270
What the fuck was that? It's nothing. Oh, fuck. What happened? I have my own. It's a gigantic.

327
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:48,520
Come here. Come here. Come here. Don't look into it.

328
01:32:49,079 --> 01:33:59,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. He's alive? I'm shooting. You just run on them.

329
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:19,750
You really good shot there.

330
01:34:20,710 --> 01:35:01,529
Next. Well, I got you. Get out. Get out. Ow. Can I get some help? Somebody can help me.

331
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:22,180
Wait, I know what to do. I need leverage. There we are.

332
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:56,149
I hit my fucking head right here. Real tragedy. I don't think you guys can even see that.

333
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:13,189
Am I okay? I think so. Actual blood. No, this is this. We heard it. I want to see it. I want to

334
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:19,449
see it. Get play space boundaries. Ah, well, here, let me, I'm going to come in close for you

335
01:36:19,449 --> 01:36:28,170
here. The reason why I don't have play space boundaries is because, um, well, I have it at

336
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:37,130
standing room only, but I still move around like I'm a fucking dickhead. I have to move around. I

337
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:46,020
can't not move around in VR. Oh, how long? Let me go take a piss and make sure that I didn't like

338
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:59,270
scuff up the front of my head. I'll be right back. It's a dent.

339
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:35,819
All right, let's see. I'm fine. Look, look at this hair. No, that's not a mark from, that's a mark.

340
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:55,819
Goodness. That's a mark from the headband. Where is the, where is the headband? Hey,

341
01:40:55,819 --> 01:47:21,210
where's the headband? I don't know. I'll be right back. I gotta find it. Battle for glory.

342
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:26,250
You're leading the way to victory. Fight among your people and the Empire.

343
01:47:27,449 --> 01:48:02,970
All right. You, you and me. All right. Fine, buddy. Oh shit there. What do we want to win?

344
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:39,239
I missed. Don't move. Don't you move. You listen to me. You and I are going to team up.

345
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:43,140
You're going to team up. We're going to kill those guys over there. You understand?

346
01:48:45,590 --> 01:49:47,109
I'll do it. Hey, fuck. All right. Get out of my way. Wait a minute. I can grab his hand.

347
01:49:48,229 --> 01:50:07,130
Wait a second. Look, I can grab his hand. Let's go. It's time to go home. Get in the car.

348
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:39,539
Come on. Come here. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're ruining my fucking joke. It's so laggy.

349
01:50:39,539 --> 01:51:07,640
I can't even fling. Come on. I can't even see what I'm doing. I'm about to crash this fucking

350
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:34,760
computer, man. Okay. Okay. Okay. I've had, I've had just about enough of you. Give me the axe.

351
01:51:54,739 --> 01:52:07,020
Killed me. He was just behind me the whole time. Oh my God. It's so laggy. Punk. No honor among

352
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:25,159
thieves. No honor among thieves. There ain't no honor among thieves anymore. Okay, let's go.

353
01:52:25,159 --> 01:52:37,319
Update fucked up performance by a lot. Really? This feels like really bad. Even when we come,

354
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:49,899
usually it gets back to like 80, 60, 70, 80 frames a second. You know what I mean? It's like

355
01:52:51,510 --> 01:53:05,909
memory leak or something. I don't know. What does that mean? Post-processing? NES resolution.

356
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:45,989
That feels the same. Next game. What am I doing next? Enable motion smoothing? Projection in

357
01:53:45,989 --> 01:53:59,430
Steam VR. 1v1 game mode using more processing power than the graphics card. We'll play the room.

358
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:07,939
It's time to relax. It's time for the relaxing portion of this room. Saw 2. I'm going to download

359
01:54:07,939 --> 01:54:17,779
the lightsaber thing. This game is fucking hilarious though. It's so much fun. It just

360
01:54:17,779 --> 01:54:25,420
kind of runs like shit lately, like I would know. All right. Let's play the room. It's time to chill

361
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:30,180
out. I'm looking forward to this. I've actually been waiting for this. When I heard this came out,

362
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:42,810
I was ecstatic. This is going to be the ultimate in Pog video games. You guys are going to be so

363
01:54:42,810 --> 01:55:01,369
happy about this. Okay. Where is it? The room. All right. Here we go. I hope this is what I think it

364
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:16,920
is. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be fucking fantastic. I can't wait. No, not the room.

365
01:55:18,439 --> 01:55:54,779
Like Tommy Wiseau. We got free center in the windows. Yeah, this just looks good. That brings

366
01:55:54,779 --> 01:56:04,420
me back. Yeah. And look, we have actual frames. Are you already disappointed? Time that person

367
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:15,930
out for 30 seconds. I have no idea. The room VR dark matter supports multiple profiles. I'm sure

368
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:20,810
it does. This is a game about, okay, let me, let me give you an example. This is a game about,

369
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:40,970
it's a game about and about and you don't understand soon enough. I need hints sometimes.

370
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:49,579
It can be kind of fucking hard. Standing. Please calibrate your standing height for the most

371
01:56:49,579 --> 01:56:52,939
comfortable gameplay experience. Stand still in the center of your play area and press calibrate.

372
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:12,569
Boomsbury police station. Getting dark. I should get back to work. I can't wait to open up like

373
01:57:12,569 --> 01:57:35,380
three boxes. Oh, sick. We're at the projector handle with dozens of disappearances in just

374
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:44,760
a few weeks, but this is one of the strangest. Bird area of the British Institute of Archeology

375
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:54,699
where the professor was last seen. How can someone disappear from this? Dr. Montgomery

376
01:57:54,699 --> 01:57:58,779
specialized in priceless Egyptian relics. He told colleagues he was on the verge of some great

377
01:57:58,779 --> 01:58:13,640
discovery. There you are. This is the piece the professor was studying when he disappeared.

378
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:22,119
Nothing else was missing. No evidence of a struggle or break in. It doesn't make sense.

379
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:32,970
I should check my desk in case the sergeant has left a report. The gentleman was asking

380
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:38,069
after you. He gave me a parcel, said it would help with the disappearances. The damn thing was

381
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:43,909
making the strangest noise. The constable told me he was hearing things. I put it in your wall safe.

382
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:55,670
You want whatever. Pick up the key. Excellent. Let it go to put it in your inventory. Okay,

383
01:58:55,670 --> 01:59:11,590
what's this? Can I open the inventory? I mean, it's just so intuitive. That's an intuitive

384
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:28,649
inventory. To get this open, there's something in evidence storage. I gotta go to evidence storage.

385
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:37,369
I cannot wait to fucking play this game. Evidence storage. I wonder if we confiscated something

386
01:59:37,369 --> 01:59:47,210
that can help me crack a safe that'll be listed on the blackboard. Oh, safe cracking. William

387
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:56,899
Crack. He cracks saves. William Clark. Safe cracking. Box number. I don't know. Please file

388
01:59:56,899 --> 02:00:01,079
evidence with the correct case number for me. The filing system isn't that complicated. Your

389
02:00:01,079 --> 02:00:16,600
detectives work it out. John E. Assault. E3. Aldem Wright. WW2. William Crack. C6.

390
02:00:17,479 --> 02:00:38,600
Wilco Streamer. Loves game. Hates chat. Oh, the hints only show up if you can't figure anything.

391
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:45,699
Look, do you see all these little gears and shit? I can't wait. This is gonna be so

392
02:00:46,260 --> 02:01:13,270
fun. Clipboard. This thing. A wine opener. Back to the safe. Where do I put this?

393
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:29,029
D-crack is safe? Oh, you mean, you mean me turn around? Don't you like put it, how do I put it

394
02:01:29,029 --> 02:01:56,729
somewhere? Mic is fucked. The mic is fucked up? Why is the mic fucked up? Mic is fucked up? What

395
02:01:56,729 --> 02:02:05,609
did I do to it? I don't know. I don't know. Was it when I bumped into it? When I smashed into it?

396
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:18,140
Maybe when I hit it. Sounds the same. I don't know.

397
02:02:18,939 --> 02:02:22,859
Alright, how do I put this? How do I get this on here? No, no, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

398
02:02:22,859 --> 02:02:29,960
This should not, I, there's a hint available to pull the tip. Now that I have the safe cracker,

399
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:53,859
I can get to work on the safe. Yeah, I, what do you, what? Oh, it's so satisfying. Oh, I love it.

400
02:02:53,859 --> 02:03:23,029
Alright, we're gonna turn some dials here. Shit, almost. Yeah. Loves it. I do love it.

401
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:47,020
Forgive my unorthodox approach detective, but I have vital information relating to a case

402
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:51,340
you're investigating. We have questions, so please take these lenses and let me show you

403
02:03:51,340 --> 02:04:20,359
what I can explain. This is the only, the beginning. Craftsman. Take the lenses? I got,

404
02:04:20,359 --> 02:04:36,939
wait, wait, wait, wait. First box. I mean, usually it's like a box with a box and then a box inside

405
02:04:36,939 --> 02:04:41,800
of a box. Open the inventory and pull the highlighted tab to put on the eyepiece.

406
02:05:03,369 --> 02:05:11,189
Alright, this is the real first box. You don't have any idea how happy I am to be playing this.

407
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:22,329
Alright, so what do we got? We got, let's examine the box. Got that. Got this. Moon,

408
02:05:22,329 --> 02:05:27,050
moon with a star on it. I don't know, any of these move? Yup, there you go. Look at that. Okay,

409
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:49,180
here we go. Then pull that tab. Tabs. Hey, looking good. You want tabs? Right here, look at this.

410
02:05:49,739 --> 02:06:28,149
Thank you. Okay, now what? Whoa, project anything? Wait a minute. Yes. Boom, this is the VR made

411
02:06:28,149 --> 02:06:50,250
of room. Welcome detective to the hidden realm of the Gnoll. The disappearances you are investigating

412
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:54,569
are part of something more sinister than you can imagine. Show you what happened to these people

413
02:06:54,569 --> 02:07:00,329
and perhaps together we can avert any further loss. This document is no ordinary letter. The

414
02:07:00,329 --> 02:07:06,090
Gnoll connects it to me. This author used the eyepiece to reveal the connection. Find the others,

415
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:30,649
discover their fates. The Craftsman. Oh, the British Institute of Archaeology. This is the room Dr.

416
02:07:30,649 --> 02:07:37,670
Montgomery was working when he disappeared. How did I get back here? So many toys to play with

417
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:59,960
in here. I can't. This is the arm made. What does it do? I don't know yet. We gotta do, we gotta do

418
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:13,670
it one by one here. I gotta get something over here. I can't do this yet. What about over here?

419
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:36,359
What's this? All right, we need a piece for this. Something goes right there. It's like a lady's

420
02:08:36,359 --> 02:08:46,729
face. Whatever it is. Hey, check chat. Gonna take him five hours? Hey, I am a veteran of the room.

421
02:08:46,729 --> 02:08:55,210
Okay, I'll have you know. I'm not just some scrub that does not play. All right, what is this?

422
02:08:55,210 --> 02:09:06,170
The poster pulled the sarcophagus from the storage room. Take through. Take to a practice of taking

423
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:11,130
about followers with them throughout their life. They believe this rite could rapid contain their

424
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:15,609
souls, but the hieroglyphics don't follow any known lexicon. Does it make any sense?

425
02:09:16,569 --> 02:09:30,119
All right, well, I don't, I wanna, I can figure this. Let's do this. What do we got here?

426
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:47,829
Touch this yet? That, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?

427
02:09:48,390 --> 02:10:17,350
A piece? Yeah, that means something. What does that mean? Grab the mic sensitivity?

428
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:26,659
Why are people talking about the mic? I must have fucked something up when I punched it and

429
02:10:26,659 --> 02:10:39,579
ripped out a cord or something. It's the wrong mic? Oh, when I turn around, you can't hear me.

430
02:10:39,579 --> 02:10:42,859
I get you. All right. Well, we can't, we, we gotta get something that fits in here.

431
02:10:42,859 --> 02:11:01,899
I can't grab this, right? No, can't do this yet. What about this guy? No, can't open that.

432
02:11:01,899 --> 02:11:14,890
Oh shit. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa. All right. I got that open.

433
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:42,710
Now. Yeah, almost. That not it? That, I got it, right? No, it's blocked up there. It's blocked

434
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:55,590
up top. How do I release that shit? Oh, excuse me. Behind you. What the fuck, dude? You're a

435
02:11:55,670 --> 02:12:10,739
warp has a face. This is to open the door, right? Probably over there.

436
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:40,119
Uh, I don't have any face words, dude. What am I missing? I'm missing something here.

437
02:12:51,770 --> 02:13:05,500
Like open that, but I can't. I don't get this all the way. That's open. Not even in the cameras.

438
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:33,220
Fuck. I thought that was a one real wall. Hey, I'm back. How are you? I can't pick that up.

439
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:41,420
What did I miss here? Something something's here that I missed. I guess I could just travel with

440
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:59,640
this thing. We'd go somewhere else. You have to go somewhere else. Oh, what was that? That's a

441
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:17,130
sarcophagus. Nice beer gut. The door is unlocked, but too heavy to open by hand. There's a rope

442
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:25,500
attached to it that leads to a set of pulleys though. Yeah, I know. Beer gut. It's not a beer

443
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:45,350
gut. It's a, it has to be something with this by hand. So I need to do this thing. I open this

444
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:56,979
coming out, but it can't just Nancy. This is way better than Nancy Drew. Hey, yo, got mesh. Shut up

445
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:13,350
and Turkey peanut oil diet for the right side of the door. But can I, I can't really go over here.

446
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:37,020
Like this is connected to that. How do I get this to move? How do I get this to like,

447
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:58,920
how do I get this to turn? Get the fuck out of the goddamn way here. What's a punch? Whatever's in

448
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:34,360
front of me. Can I, can I, can I pull? Oh shit. Look at that. Let's go get this shit out. Oh yeah.

449
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:49,239
That's a big guy right there. Porter was back asking about my progress. A curious fellow. He

450
02:16:49,239 --> 02:16:55,319
seemed almost confused that I couldn't crack the code. He gave me a parcel, said it had been left

451
02:16:55,319 --> 02:17:01,000
for me in the post room. Inside was an odd looking lens along with a note that said the lens would

452
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:18,200
help me in my work. Goodness knows that it was going to help me. What do you got? I hit him in

453
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:33,399
the head with a, with a crowbar. Oh shit. Brass. Wait, wait, wait. Wasn't there a circle somewhere

454
02:17:33,399 --> 02:17:54,979
that needed a circle? Something needed a circle here. Where did this need to go? Cursor for

455
02:17:54,979 --> 02:18:15,500
cursor. Mouse on the screen. You guys call the, did I get it? Did I get it? Over here? Right there,

456
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:40,520
right? Shit. Where'd this fucking go? Head? Want it back. Doesn't know shapes. In the book.

457
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:18,170
Oh, that just spawned something in there. We gotta spawn. Yep. The eyepiece. Oh yeah.

458
02:19:18,889 --> 02:19:45,399
Fuck is that? He'll do, okay. We got a lot of shit going on here. That's new. What did I just do?

459
02:19:46,040 --> 02:20:06,250
Did I win? What? I just pressed, did I press it, did I do it? Everybody understand what just happened?

460
02:20:07,049 --> 02:20:23,100
I had to unlock. Yeah, I did. But how do I open? Should be unlocked then, right?

461
02:20:24,299 --> 02:20:32,629
That easy? Or am I doing something wrong? I feel like you have to like move this.

462
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:42,549
Please smash the reddit shelf. I'm, I don't want that to happen. That'd be something I'm doing wrong

463
02:20:42,549 --> 02:21:00,180
here. Need something to put in there. Oh, that AC feels so fucking good right now. I'm such a

464
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:22,440
degenerate. I thought this was a slot machine. That we need a triangle pointing up. I just won

465
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:40,459
accidentally. And now what? Okay. That's going to go this way. This one, right? What, rabbit?

466
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:59,930
20 to here. And what animal? What's the animal? Uh, where does that go? That's, that'll fit this.

467
02:22:02,819 --> 02:22:12,659
Oh shit. I've got a tool. Okay. All right. It's getting more, we're getting more interesting here.

468
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:31,610
Animal. Generate gambler. Generate gambler. What is it? What's the shape? Like a little claw.

469
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:51,110
Wait, can I do that? It's vibrating like I can. Oh shit. There's even more of this crap.

470
02:22:51,829 --> 02:23:15,700
No mouse on the screen. Wait a minute. Come on. Really? That's not like the tool to like break

471
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:37,340
into his head. I see this now. Nothing new from that. Touch him. Find him at the beginning.

472
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:51,290
Oh, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool. Tool, tool, tool. Check it out. Oh yeah. Sick.

473
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:22,700
Nice. Open up. Oh, the distinctively shaped head. I need to turn that. Brave stone disc. It's a

474
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:32,069
that goes over there. How do I move this? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. We got, um, uh, eagle and

475
02:24:34,069 --> 02:24:49,049
flamingo and stop. Flamingo and, uh, bee. Wasp. Flamingo, wasp. What do we got here? Flamingo,

476
02:24:50,889 --> 02:25:11,750
wasp. Ow. Where's the, where is it? Flamingo, wasp. We're over here. Read chat for a second.

477
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:29,139
I'm here. Actually on screen. Saved. Saved. All right. We're good. I got flamingo selected.

478
02:25:29,139 --> 02:25:42,360
So now I got that tool. Right? Yeah. All right. Let's go back over here. The reason why this game

479
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:47,639
is so much fun. All right. Let me fucking actually talk to you guys. The reason why this game is fun

480
02:25:47,639 --> 02:25:51,799
is because one thing leads to another thing. Another thing leads to this. That opens that,

481
02:25:51,799 --> 02:26:11,079
that opens that box and then that box opens on its own. Wait, I got a match. Okay. Hold on. Give me

482
02:26:11,079 --> 02:26:34,979
a minute. Got to be green or is it going to be green? Red and blue and wait, did they? Oh fuck.

483
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:53,030
Okay. I, uh, they all have to be red. Rubik's cube. I mean, does it have to be red, green and

484
02:26:53,829 --> 02:27:29,510
that's it. That's it. I got it. I did it. Let's go. Open up. What the hell does that do? Stuck his

485
02:27:29,510 --> 02:28:02,920
tongue out at me. I can't even look at it now. You guys have ruined this for me. I can't, I can't.

486
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:21,659
Somebody said one thing and that's all it took. Okay. Well, now what do I do? These were instructions

487
02:28:21,659 --> 02:28:31,540
on how to do the first part. I'm such an idiot. Wait, it came out of all four places. Wait,

488
02:28:31,540 --> 02:29:05,420
not over here, right? What else did I not do? Over here? We got, I don't understand this part.

489
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:12,940
I'm looking for an animal. I guess we could, it's one of the four chance. Of course we could

490
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:35,750
just guess. What is this? Uh, yep. Another one of those. Okay. Flamingo. It's another, it's a one

491
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:53,430
out of four chance. Okay. I'm going to get from that box. I am going to get a flamingo. Oh,

492
02:29:53,430 --> 02:30:06,219
why, why does the cursor keep coming back? I'm not doing that. You're clear. I'm clearly across

493
02:30:06,219 --> 02:30:26,069
the whole room. All right. Think. Think for a second. Think. Can't move this. This is the

494
02:30:26,069 --> 02:30:31,739
tool that I'm going to be able to slide in here and then pull this out. Press her again? No.

495
02:30:31,739 --> 02:30:48,020
Pulley system can lift up the mummy. Can it? Goodness. Look at you. Look at what you just said.

496
02:30:48,659 --> 02:31:13,450
Quite a different pulley now. Is there a dog? Oh shit. Look at this. I'm pretty strong in this.

497
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:19,879
I knew that was going to happen. Pull it back up.

498
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:38,569
Okay. It is a dog. All right. It's Otto. Um, he can't really come in here right now.

499
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:44,819
What am I going to do about that? He can't come in here right now. I'll be like, Oh, Otto,

500
02:31:44,819 --> 02:31:53,909
where is he? I don't want to step on him. Let me see what he wants. Let him in. No, that's dangerous.

501
02:31:53,909 --> 02:32:00,409
I don't want to, I could, I could like hurt him. All right. Let me, hold on. Let me go see what he

502
02:32:00,409 --> 02:32:09,719
wants. Hold on. All right. Let me see what he wants. I think he might, maybe he wants to go.

503
02:32:09,719 --> 02:33:34,420
Give me one sec. I'll be right back. He's here. He's in the room. I just wanted to come in. He's

504
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:40,579
all the way in the corner over there. So he's, he's not in any, uh, play area. There's no reason

505
02:33:40,579 --> 02:33:52,489
why I would ever go all the way over there. Oh him? I don't know what I'm doing. Right over here.

506
02:33:52,489 --> 02:34:09,030
He just wanted to come and lie down on a blanket. He is, he is like all I've, there's no reason why

507
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:11,909
I would go over there. He just wanted to come in and hang out. You said that's all you wanted?

508
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:31,370
We did it boys. Hey, you having fun in the room? I'm looking forward to this game for like a

509
02:34:31,370 --> 02:34:40,010
hundred years and half like, half like, half, uh, like, you know, like half like, uh, half

510
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:45,659
like Alex, like doing that tomorrow. And that's what we're doing the whole stream. So that's why

511
02:34:45,659 --> 02:34:51,930
I want to play a few of the games that I had lined up that are not half life Alex. That's

512
02:34:51,930 --> 02:35:03,799
what we're doing all stream tomorrow. Fucking motorcycle game. It looked fun too. That's the

513
02:35:03,799 --> 02:35:21,450
worst part about it. The game is this. This is called the room VR a dark matter. Come out on

514
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:37,350
screen. No, I don't have, I don't have a feed. I don't know what happened here, but we can get

515
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:46,709
back to normal. That'd be good. All right. So thanks for the one guy. That was a really good

516
02:35:46,709 --> 02:36:05,340
advice to lift up the sarcophagus with the other thing. Pretty sick. Well, I need my team of

517
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:12,729
assistants to play VR. It'll be like three people in the room. One to make sure I don't hit a wall.

518
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:46,149
One to make sure I can hear the audio until I take care of my dog. I got that ball. I could sense

519
02:36:46,149 --> 02:36:58,889
the shelf. I could smell it. Whoa. I got his beard. I can't like take his beard off. What is

520
02:36:58,889 --> 02:37:17,799
this for? I put like a walnut in here. Oh, no, no, no. I got the, what's the globe for

521
02:37:17,799 --> 02:37:41,909
and a little circle. What the fuck are you talking about? I need an animal. We got it. Look at it.

522
02:37:41,909 --> 02:37:49,829
We got, Oh, you're close. All right. You guys see an animal? Oh, this is probably important.

523
02:37:50,389 --> 02:38:05,850
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know what that does. I have that glove though. Let's

524
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:23,530
show. Can I put the globe in here? Mayo stomach. Damn it. Damn it. Ah, ah. What about in here?

525
02:38:31,180 --> 02:38:59,190
Let's put it in his mouth. Add munkah. Hmm. What's munkah? Hmm. How do I do with this thing? Oh,

526
02:38:59,829 --> 02:39:16,409
well, it looks like I got myself a sword, ceremonial dagger. That goes in his mouth,

527
02:39:16,409 --> 02:39:38,819
right? You open the mouth and you slip it in. It goes there. No, this is not what you do.

528
02:39:39,930 --> 02:40:06,420
I got a sword. Can it go over there? What the fuck was that? I just gave it to him. What does

529
02:40:06,420 --> 02:40:49,209
it want me to do there though? Okay. It's a symbol. I don't swear in front of Otto. He's mean

530
02:40:49,209 --> 02:41:24,020
something, but I don't know what they mean. Okay. Found it. It's dog pot. What the fuck does that

531
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:46,010
mean? Dog pot. Oh, that's just the solution to the thing that I guessed. Egger? Egger here? Oh,

532
02:41:51,379 --> 02:42:13,129
yes. Okay. Now what? Faved cylinder. Here? I think this goes over here. It looks like it matches,

533
02:42:13,129 --> 02:42:36,870
doesn't it? Going inside of his body somewhere? He missed four holes, man. I don't know which hole

534
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:53,159
it goes in. Look at that little indentation right there. Up your chair, up your ass. No,

535
02:42:54,139 --> 02:43:25,620
no thanks. I think I'm okay. I think I'm going to be good. I do with you. It's a puzzle. It's a

536
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:27,860
puzzle. It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. You're going to be in the right part of

537
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:47,579
the room. It's a puzzle. I have to be standing in the right part of the room. Oh shit. That's so

538
02:43:47,579 --> 02:44:17,780
cool. That's so cool. Now what? Now what? Oh, let's get. Oh. Hellas. Let's go. It feels so good.

539
02:44:26,899 --> 02:44:46,500
There? Open up. Bingo. Oh shit. Stone tile. And another thing. And I got the, what's the Harry

540
02:44:46,500 --> 02:45:09,879
Potter thing that they all chase? What is that? Oh Lord. I got to rebuild like Stonehenge.

541
02:45:09,879 --> 02:45:40,920
All right. Wait, that's not right. Okay. Oh, hold on. Bingo. There's the piece. The piece that we

542
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:52,440
need. And there's a bowl in there. Dude. Okay. Cool. Looking good. Sound design is really good.

543
02:45:52,440 --> 02:46:01,829
Yeah. No, this would be their fifth game or sixth game in this series. I am begging you to go play

544
02:46:01,829 --> 02:46:07,750
the room. At least the first one and the second one. If you like just like playing with little

545
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:13,430
trinkets and toys and clicking and boxes and shit. It's unbelievable. It's one of the most fun

546
02:46:13,430 --> 02:46:18,629
series on steam right now. I don't know how much it is. It's less than like 15 bucks in it.

547
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:32,629
It's an ADHD game. Yeah. I mean, call it whatever you want. Okay. I have the other piece here.

548
02:46:33,270 --> 02:47:01,909
Here we go. Definitely flamingo. Metal handle. Oh, where does this go? Oh, a decorated amulet.

549
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:35,100
Oh, wait. Oh, now they have a stone tile with a metal token in it. Now I got two tokens.

550
02:47:35,100 --> 02:48:09,799
Uh, I thought that was going to be right. Tokens in his mouth. Not a bad idea. I mean,

551
02:48:09,799 --> 02:48:13,399
it wasn't, it actually kind of was a bad idea. It really, it really was a bad idea.

552
02:48:16,729 --> 02:48:46,600
Three tokens. Did I miss anything over here? This is done, right? This box is done. Yeah. Here we go.

553
02:48:46,600 --> 02:49:53,219
Ooh, that makes a good clicking sound. Oh, fuck. Come on. Let's go. Okay. Let's bust in the box.

554
02:49:54,700 --> 02:50:13,430
Find out. Here we go. Oh, wow. He's go in there. That's right. No, let's go put it inside of him.

555
02:50:13,430 --> 02:50:26,620
So does it matter the order? Oh, this look, this is organs. This is a lungs. Heart. This is

556
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:47,420
intestine. I don't know. Kidneys. Brain. Heart. Uh, that's a heart, right? No, is this, this is a

557
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:57,319
liver? No, that's a stomach. That looks like a brain. This looks like a brain. Okay. Got it.

558
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:13,290
Thank you. Congratulations. You have completed my quest. Now please take the riches inside of my

559
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:52,329
chest. Yes. Whoa. It actually is a heart. Have to take his heart? Dude, guys, this is, I don't know

560
02:51:52,329 --> 02:52:35,219
about it. All right, we got to go back to this. Not the string. I supposed to do that? Is he going

561
02:52:35,219 --> 02:52:57,559
to be alive behind me? He's going to be alive behind me, isn't he? Oh, ice. Holy shit. Okay.

562
02:52:57,559 --> 02:53:03,420
Oh, he's been here. He's always been here since the beginning, waiting, waiting at the beginning

563
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:10,780
at the temple. They all wait at the beginning. I see them. They aren't blind like me. Trump, right?

564
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:41,020
This, where are we going? Oh, the beginning. I feel like I'm at Disney world right now.

565
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:57,780
Let's do a Disney ride. It's a good one though. Oh, but this is the, how do I put this? Oh, hey,

566
02:53:57,780 --> 02:54:18,010
loading that. I have two more of those to do. Oh, the note. Long one. Welcome back detective.

567
02:54:18,010 --> 02:54:23,639
Perhaps now you can understand the danger we face. I mean, I don't really, I don't really know what

568
02:54:23,639 --> 02:54:28,760
the danger is, but I guess it's scary. The artifact you collected now holds the very essence, the soul,

569
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:35,819
if you will, of the professor. Sacrifice will help further my work and bring these arcane forces

570
02:54:35,899 --> 02:54:42,459
safely under my control. Onward to another of those lost unfortunates, a servant of God this time.

571
02:54:42,459 --> 02:54:48,540
He was searching for some long forgotten relic. You must uncover what he found. A crack head.

572
02:54:49,100 --> 02:55:10,489
Oh, we're in a church. Church, perhaps this reverend will have some answers for me.

573
02:55:22,899 --> 02:55:33,719
We don't, let's go. Let's start our search. A box. And there's just a big ass key in here. You got

574
02:55:33,719 --> 02:55:46,409
it. Cool. Okay, we got a door in front. Thing on the left. Go left. Oh, this is the podium. Okay.

575
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:53,780
Here. Six, one, five, eight, seven, three, nine, eight, one, four. Or it's probably going to be

576
02:55:53,780 --> 02:56:00,500
some Sudoku math problem, right? The puzzle was fucking easy. The puzzle was just pretty good.

577
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:41,610
Oh, this door. It just opens. I got the key. I got the key, man. Oh, shit. All right, lots of

578
02:56:41,610 --> 02:57:01,540
levers here. Maybe we should have done that. Where's Obi-Wan Kenobi here? An old man I've

579
02:57:01,540 --> 02:57:06,500
not seen before approached me after Evan saw the legend of this chapel and the relic hidden

580
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:10,899
somewhere within these stone walls. He gave me a small box that it contained something that would

581
02:57:10,899 --> 02:57:23,370
help me, something which would unlock truth. The well. Wait, wait, wait. We saw those, didn't we?

582
02:57:24,170 --> 02:57:52,569
Yep. All right. N plus W thing. Plus E thing. There it is. Zoomers Maulding. Why do we have

583
02:57:52,569 --> 02:58:00,760
Zoomers Maulding? All right, well, something obviously goes in there. I don't know what.

584
02:58:05,270 --> 02:58:11,829
Goes in here, obviously. I don't know what. Oh, there's tons of places you can go through.

585
02:58:11,829 --> 02:58:17,350
Miles the Templar's carried the cargo. An hour before midnight, the attack began.

586
02:58:18,309 --> 02:58:49,620
That's a clock. How do I change the clock? There's a lot of space here. That's a plate

587
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:56,100
for the well, right? Mirror fragments set in stone? All right, whatever. It's a process, right?

588
02:58:56,739 --> 02:59:13,819
Look at these books. Books? Wait, put the night vision on. Make sure there's nothing in there.

589
02:59:13,819 --> 02:59:40,260
All right, I got the well. I'm good to go. That go in here. No, place to go behind me.

590
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:55,110
I mean, absolutely no disrespect. I mean, no disrespect in here, okay? I just say that all

591
02:59:55,110 --> 03:00:06,170
the time. I say that all the time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Check auto. Oh,

592
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:27,909
he's okay. He's right over here. Auto is gone. He's right over here. We're concerned. He's right

593
03:00:27,909 --> 03:00:35,799
there. He's okay. He's just chilling over there. He's lined up. Man out the window.

594
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:56,700
Okay, let's go. Is this for the clock? Well, I can't move that now. It's not. It's going to be.

595
03:00:57,260 --> 03:01:09,270
There's going to be a whole thing here. Turn around. I have this bowl. What do I do with the

596
03:01:09,270 --> 03:01:23,260
bowl? Can I get in here? What do I do with that bowl? I'm not going to steal auto's way over there.

597
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:42,149
Get a real job, German. Nine to five. How do we even respond to the get a job comment?

598
03:01:47,860 --> 03:01:57,739
Hey, get a job. All right, dad. I'll do it. I got to get that to 11 o'clock.

599
03:01:58,459 --> 03:02:18,940
Oh, hold on. Right there. First. Hold on a sec. Am I changing the clock? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

600
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:32,139
Is that doing anything? I don't know. I can't tell if this is doing anything.

601
03:02:33,719 --> 03:02:52,090
Lock. I'm not doing shit. What are you talking about? I'm doing anything.

602
03:02:52,729 --> 03:03:11,350
Well, I can go down there though with this. Oh, nice. Okay. Move it. Grab it.

603
03:03:13,510 --> 03:03:31,479
I felt pretty good. Oh, this is telling somebody screenshot this. This is telling me something.

604
03:03:31,479 --> 03:03:36,729
You'd like blue, black, yellow, white, blue, black, yellow, yellow, blue. Okay. Somebody

605
03:03:36,729 --> 03:03:52,040
screenshot that. We're going to need it in like 10 minutes. Oh, that was completely wrong.

606
03:03:52,040 --> 03:04:28,040
screenshot that now. I don't know why. I really don't know. I don't know why. I swear to God,

607
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:32,040
this is going to sound really weird. I just felt like for one second that my dick was out.

608
03:04:33,399 --> 03:04:42,860
I'm weird. I just, I don't know. I just, I got a weird panic where I'm just like,

609
03:04:42,860 --> 03:04:48,920
holy shit. I think, I think my dick is out. I don't know why that's getting to him.

610
03:04:49,639 --> 03:05:07,700
All right. What else? What? I got that bowl back here with the numbers are over here.

611
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:17,850
There's numbers over here. Those two, wait a minute. Two, six, one, six, one, four, five,

612
03:05:17,850 --> 03:05:22,809
eight. I need the four, four, five, eight, seven. Yeah. I need a four. What do we get the four?

613
03:05:26,329 --> 03:06:02,760
Four over there, right? Let me do this bowl. How do I do that bowl? Oh, fuck. This one already,

614
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:10,200
right? Yeah. I did that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Something appeared over there.

615
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:15,260
But yeah, yeah, yeah. The box, you got it. Yep. Yep.

616
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:22,489
The crystals look unusual. Perhaps I should use the new lens to examine them.

617
03:06:23,209 --> 03:06:39,690
Strange. It feels like I'm being pulled towards them. Oh my God. This is terrifying.

618
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:50,860
He just went up. He just went up. He just went to actual height. You see, with the actual size.

619
03:06:56,180 --> 03:07:16,459
Should I jump around? Whoa. I'm inside of this thing. Oh, I guess I'm turning it. Oh goodness.

620
03:07:16,459 --> 03:07:54,020
Okay. And then, whoa, there it is. What do I get? Glass decanter. Hey, that will fit.

621
03:07:54,899 --> 03:07:57,459
Where's that going to, I know where that goes. That goes somewhere interesting.

622
03:07:59,579 --> 03:08:09,579
Goblet of fire. Break it. Orb. Orb. Eat the orb. Eat the orb. Orb. Goblet of fire. No.

623
03:08:17,030 --> 03:08:31,299
Oh, this decanter fits here, but it doesn't do anything. I must have missed something.

624
03:08:31,299 --> 03:08:37,750
Oh, that makes me wicked thirsty. That just made me so thirsty. That makes me so thirsty.

625
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:45,420
I want to drink this so bad. This is just blue powerade, right? The way that it came into,

626
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:50,540
it was just blue powerade going in. I want a blue powerade right now, if anybody has any.

627
03:08:51,100 --> 03:09:32,760
We get anything? Oh, the star. And you can go inside. Root forced it. I didn't root force

628
03:09:32,760 --> 03:09:46,500
anything. There we go. This is my favorite part so far. I love that. I'm going to get a screenshot,

629
03:09:46,500 --> 03:10:04,010
right? Oh, it's right there already. Thanks. Thank you. I'll upload that. Okay. There it is.

630
03:10:04,010 --> 03:10:28,840
I got it. I had it. I did? I did. I just did it. I just did it. Did I do it? Blue, red, blue, red,

631
03:10:29,559 --> 03:11:07,540
yellow, orange. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I just did it, didn't I? That's correct. That's not just

632
03:11:07,540 --> 03:11:40,549
correct. That was correct already. Wait a second. This isn't colorblind. I'm not colorblind. It's

633
03:11:40,549 --> 03:12:09,479
going to spin it up. I'm going to spin it. Okay. Then we flip that around. It's right there. That's

634
03:12:09,479 --> 03:12:43,829
it. I did it, but give it to me. I win. What am I doing wrong here? Do I have to like lock it in?

635
03:12:45,930 --> 03:13:03,659
Like, yes, lock it in. Does it have to be the opposite? Except the one outside.

636
03:13:18,739 --> 03:13:28,540
Isn't it right? In his own world. Yeah, but it's right, isn't it? Don't read chat. They're

637
03:13:28,540 --> 03:13:33,739
just shaking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't wait until you get timed out for fucking five minutes.

638
03:13:35,510 --> 03:13:45,299
I can't wait until you're gone for at least five minutes. Stop reading chat.

639
03:13:45,459 --> 03:13:58,659
A little shaking. Oh, man. That person is right. That person's right.

640
03:14:03,299 --> 03:14:14,649
Got to match that in here. Right. All right. So we need yellow, green.

641
03:14:35,049 --> 03:15:29,270
I got to get the blue there. The wooden box. There's a large lever and two pulleys. I can

642
03:15:29,270 --> 03:15:39,479
use it to change the pattern of light. A hint will be available when the timer has ended.

643
03:15:40,120 --> 03:16:16,620
I can't cheat fast enough. And it more. That's not, that's wrong. I found on the stone door,

644
03:16:16,620 --> 03:16:21,020
I could use the wooden box to shine a matching symbol at the door. So that's correct.

645
03:16:22,139 --> 03:17:07,219
I already did it. That little guy right there. A chess. Oh, man. I just love that bullshit thing.

646
03:17:11,899 --> 03:17:20,579
Um, Stormwind, who's the Stormwind guy? Like the shield of Stormwind, right?

647
03:17:20,579 --> 03:17:27,209
I'll go check. Over there. Take that. Thank you.

648
03:17:28,010 --> 03:17:39,700
Gonna make that. Somebody screenshot that. Hello, blue, pink, yellow, blue. Got it.

649
03:17:40,340 --> 03:18:08,659
Oh, let's make that thing pink, yellow, blue. Sorry. That was okay. We're good.

650
03:18:08,659 --> 03:18:35,129
Okay. We're not good. I'm getting tangled. Right. Well, shit. What was it? Pink, pink, yellow,

651
03:18:35,129 --> 03:18:52,520
blue. But those were different. And I can't, I wouldn't purple. Uh, what is this? I think one

652
03:18:52,520 --> 03:19:09,190
of these, this was flipped around. This one was up the other way. Like that. Right. I'll let you.

653
03:19:09,190 --> 03:19:16,860
What the fuck are you doing, man? Like that. Right. And it was pink, yellow, blue. Is that it?

654
03:19:17,659 --> 03:19:26,969
Did I get it? I think I got it. Why is the camera facing,

655
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:41,510
how come the camera's not facing the other person? Why is the camera facing you? That's it right

656
03:19:41,510 --> 03:19:45,559
there. That's the one right there. All right. I got to face the camera at the right guy.

657
03:19:57,639 --> 03:20:26,680
Um, I put a mirror over there. I sure do. That's something else on your back. Um, that's a mirror,

658
03:20:27,319 --> 03:20:38,420
a mirror, um, hanging on his utility belt. I need something to go here. Um, this, some Tetris

659
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:52,579
piece has to go right here. Uh, it, it does not, does not suck or burst your bubble there, but

660
03:20:52,579 --> 03:21:20,629
nope, I think you're very incorrect. How does this go? Our piece. Spin it. Up here?

661
03:21:22,500 --> 03:21:51,940
There? Possible. Right here. Oh, I haven't been in here in a while. Was there anything in here I

662
03:21:51,940 --> 03:22:12,280
could do? Uh, ha ha ha ha ha. Remember with the Victory Royale in room four.

663
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:39,510
Got another box, ladies and gentlemen. It's a big one. Not going there yet. Block picking tool,

664
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:43,540
Can I reach in here?

665
03:22:43,540 --> 03:22:50,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

666
03:22:50,120 --> 03:22:52,120
Probably have to go in there first.

667
03:22:52,120 --> 03:23:01,399
Oh, right.

668
03:23:01,399 --> 03:23:04,469
I'm inside the vault.

669
03:23:04,469 --> 03:23:07,930
I know I'm getting closer. I can feel it.

670
03:23:07,930 --> 03:23:09,930
I hear it. Worlds within worlds.

671
03:23:09,930 --> 03:23:11,930
The old man can't have known what this

672
03:23:11,930 --> 03:23:13,930
lens revealed. Why would he give me something

673
03:23:13,930 --> 03:23:19,620
this valuable?

674
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:29,930
Why would he do that?

675
03:23:29,930 --> 03:23:40,729
Alright, let's see.

676
03:23:40,729 --> 03:23:42,729
I need to pick this lock.

677
03:23:42,729 --> 03:23:53,530
Being tiny.

678
03:23:53,530 --> 03:23:56,860
I got that.

679
03:23:56,860 --> 03:23:59,739
I have to go open the other side?

680
03:23:59,739 --> 03:24:09,719
How do I get on the other side? How do I get over there?

681
03:24:09,719 --> 03:24:18,409
How do I get over there?

682
03:24:18,409 --> 03:24:21,610
How do I get over there? What the fuck?

683
03:24:21,610 --> 03:24:23,610
Alright, I'm done. I'll see you guys

684
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:25,909
in like a week.

685
03:24:25,909 --> 03:24:27,909
I'm going to get the fuck out of here. Fucking stupid.

686
03:24:27,909 --> 03:24:50,680
How do I get over there?

687
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:53,299
Unlock this side?

688
03:25:06,729 --> 03:25:09,420
Okay.

689
03:25:09,420 --> 03:25:23,180
I can't go in the other side.

690
03:25:23,180 --> 03:25:27,719
I can't go in this side.

691
03:25:27,719 --> 03:25:30,280
I can only walk in there.

692
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:43,909
Brain, ha ha ha.

693
03:25:43,909 --> 03:26:04,500
Up on the right.

694
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:06,870
Come on, I'll get it.

695
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:08,870
My nose is so itchy. It bugs all of my eyes.

696
03:26:08,870 --> 03:26:35,799
It bugs all of me.

697
03:26:35,799 --> 03:26:37,799
Shit. I had it too.

698
03:26:37,799 --> 03:27:14,459
Alright, it's done.

699
03:27:14,459 --> 03:27:18,809
It's fleas.

700
03:27:18,809 --> 03:27:37,110
Not fucking fleas, folks.

701
03:27:37,110 --> 03:27:39,420
Right in the AC.

702
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:46,459
I've been streaming for three and a half hours?

703
03:27:46,459 --> 03:27:51,430
Really?

704
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:57,620
Any medallion?

705
03:27:57,620 --> 03:28:08,950
What's with this box?

706
03:28:08,950 --> 03:28:34,620
I can't go up or down with this.

707
03:28:34,620 --> 03:29:01,559
I can't drag it down.

708
03:29:01,559 --> 03:29:05,579
Play Left 4 Dead 2 for a minute.

709
03:29:05,579 --> 03:29:13,639
Probe! Oh, this is going to be hell.

710
03:29:13,639 --> 03:29:16,579
I know I'm not going to do very well on this.

711
03:29:16,579 --> 03:30:09,379
I think this is going to be horrible.

712
03:30:09,379 --> 03:30:12,069
Slug Pug.

713
03:30:12,069 --> 03:30:14,819
Should I delete? Where are you?

714
03:30:14,819 --> 03:30:18,409
Should I delete Slug Pug?

715
03:30:18,409 --> 03:30:20,409
I added it for like an hour one day and I just was like,

716
03:30:20,409 --> 03:30:23,100
you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to get rid of it.

717
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:31,930
Should I get rid of Slug Pug or no?

718
03:30:31,930 --> 03:30:36,219
That's medallion number two?

719
03:30:36,219 --> 03:30:42,790
Yeah, fucking kill it.

720
03:30:42,790 --> 03:30:45,540
Please do. It sucks.

721
03:30:45,540 --> 03:30:47,540
I can't even see it. This isn't a VTTV.

722
03:30:47,540 --> 03:31:01,159
Probably one more.

723
03:31:01,159 --> 03:31:18,040
I don't. I don't like this one.

724
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:20,040
This is the Impossible Staircase thing.

725
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:29,530
I'm getting Super Monkey Ball flashbacks right now.

726
03:31:29,530 --> 03:31:32,600
I feel like I'm playing Monkey Ball.

727
03:31:32,600 --> 03:31:37,780
It's freaking me out.

728
03:31:37,780 --> 03:31:39,780
I've got to turn this all over.

729
03:31:39,780 --> 03:31:51,350
How do I even manipulate this?

730
03:31:51,350 --> 03:31:53,350
Probably all screaming right now.

731
03:31:53,350 --> 03:31:55,350
Like, dude, just pull the fucking rope, dude.

732
03:31:55,350 --> 03:32:05,379
Good. Come in.

733
03:32:05,379 --> 03:32:16,950
That's one of them.

734
03:32:16,950 --> 03:32:40,739
I'm going to get the second one.

735
03:32:40,739 --> 03:32:43,049
Yo, Jerma, that's a nice ass you got there.

736
03:32:43,049 --> 03:32:46,889
It's supposed to just like,

737
03:32:46,889 --> 03:32:56,489
fake comment.

738
03:32:56,489 --> 03:33:00,010
Alright, so in here,

739
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:08,139
where's the second one? Up there.

740
03:33:08,139 --> 03:33:11,530
We're going to go up the stairs.

741
03:33:11,530 --> 03:33:14,729
Here we go. We've got to end up here.

742
03:33:14,729 --> 03:33:16,729
That's where we have to end up.

743
03:33:16,729 --> 03:33:18,729
We're going to go that way, around,

744
03:33:18,729 --> 03:33:22,629
that way, that way, across.

745
03:33:22,629 --> 03:33:25,829
Oh, we go over here,

746
03:33:25,829 --> 03:33:27,829
through there. We go up these stairs.

747
03:33:27,829 --> 03:33:29,829
We go around. He's got it.

748
03:33:29,829 --> 03:33:31,829
Bingo. Let's end this place.

749
03:33:31,829 --> 03:33:42,389
Let's go, skip to the top.

750
03:33:42,389 --> 03:33:57,540
Told you I was going to get it.

751
03:33:57,540 --> 03:34:01,700
That would be number three.

752
03:34:01,700 --> 03:34:03,700
Stream is making me feel like I drank too much Nyquil.

753
03:34:03,700 --> 03:34:14,139
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

754
03:34:14,139 --> 03:34:16,139
Is that an off-handed,

755
03:34:16,139 --> 03:34:18,139
boring stream comment?

756
03:34:18,139 --> 03:34:20,139
That was pretty good.

757
03:34:20,139 --> 03:34:22,629
If so, that was pretty clever.

758
03:34:22,629 --> 03:34:28,200
I'm having fun

759
03:34:28,200 --> 03:34:30,200
in my puzzle game, okay?

760
03:34:30,200 --> 03:34:34,040
Under the stars of Taurus,

761
03:34:34,040 --> 03:34:36,040
the boomer fell.

762
03:34:36,040 --> 03:34:38,040
The Templars lay defeated, yet the cargo

763
03:34:38,040 --> 03:34:42,579
was saved. Why does everyone

764
03:34:42,579 --> 03:34:45,079
love me?

765
03:34:45,079 --> 03:34:47,079
You're talking about me.

766
03:34:47,079 --> 03:34:51,049
End of this. This is fun. Yeah, it's fun.

767
03:34:51,049 --> 03:34:53,670
I've been looking forward to this game.

768
03:34:53,670 --> 03:35:01,719
Yo, chubby bunny.

769
03:35:01,719 --> 03:35:06,840
How fast do you think I can move?

770
03:35:06,840 --> 03:35:08,840
Under the stairs of Taurus,

771
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:11,780
the banner fell.

772
03:35:11,780 --> 03:35:13,780
Templars lay defeated, yet the cargo was saved.

773
03:35:13,780 --> 03:35:15,780
Under the stars of Taurus, the banner did

774
03:35:15,780 --> 03:35:18,540
fall.

775
03:35:29,399 --> 03:35:31,399
Under the stars of Taurus,

776
03:35:31,399 --> 03:35:33,770
the banner did fall.

777
03:35:33,770 --> 03:35:35,770
Now, here's the question.

778
03:35:35,770 --> 03:35:37,770
I know that that's

779
03:35:37,770 --> 03:35:40,069
Gemini.

780
03:35:40,069 --> 03:35:45,559
I don't know if that is Taurus.

781
03:35:45,559 --> 03:35:47,559
That's Taurus, right? No, that's the goat.

782
03:35:47,559 --> 03:35:49,559
What's the goat? The ram?

783
03:35:49,559 --> 03:35:51,559
Ares. Ares the ram.

784
03:35:55,829 --> 03:35:57,829
Binding of Isaac. That's the one that

785
03:35:57,829 --> 03:35:59,829
destroys the whole room when you use it.

786
03:35:59,829 --> 03:36:04,549
Bacon. Bacon.

787
03:36:04,549 --> 03:36:08,520
Pisces is the fish.

788
03:36:08,520 --> 03:36:10,520
Question mark. What's the Taurus?

789
03:36:10,520 --> 03:36:13,399
Taurus is the horn. Taurus is the horns.

790
03:36:13,399 --> 03:36:15,399
That's not the goat. That's not the goat.

791
03:36:15,399 --> 03:36:17,399
The sheep, whatever it is. Ares the goat.

792
03:36:17,399 --> 03:36:21,670
One with the horns.

793
03:36:21,670 --> 03:36:26,659
Taurus is under one. What are the two M's?

794
03:36:26,659 --> 03:36:32,739
Taurus is ten.

795
03:36:32,739 --> 03:36:34,739
Okay, so we gotta get ten.

796
03:36:34,739 --> 03:36:39,159
We gotta get this ten o'clock.

797
03:36:39,159 --> 03:36:53,620
What about doing these medallions?

798
03:36:53,620 --> 03:36:57,959
I know.

799
03:36:57,959 --> 03:36:59,959
I know where they go, right over here.

800
03:36:59,959 --> 03:37:14,790
On screen? Yeah, man.

801
03:37:14,790 --> 03:37:18,700
Look, we've been doing all kinds of

802
03:37:18,700 --> 03:37:20,700
crazy shit in VR. I wanna do a puzzle game.

803
03:37:20,700 --> 03:37:33,350
Where do these go?

804
03:37:33,350 --> 03:37:49,079
Look at this. Slug storm.

805
03:37:49,079 --> 03:37:53,049
They're on coke.

806
03:37:53,049 --> 03:37:55,540
I am not on

807
03:37:55,540 --> 03:37:57,540
coke. I am sorry to do.

808
03:37:57,540 --> 03:37:59,540
I guess like, uh, that unfortunately

809
03:37:59,540 --> 03:38:01,540
for you, I don't know what.

810
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:03,909
You want me to be on coke?

811
03:38:03,909 --> 03:38:25,590
Ooh, how about you just relax?

812
03:38:25,590 --> 03:38:30,969
If we're gonna do some working

813
03:38:30,969 --> 03:38:32,969
practice, we can find a way to fix it. Of course it's not working.

814
03:38:32,969 --> 03:38:35,139
Hammer? I have a hammer.

815
03:38:35,139 --> 03:38:44,659
Copper? Wait, we gotta

816
03:38:44,659 --> 03:38:50,040
go upstairs now.

817
03:38:50,040 --> 03:38:52,040
Remember I told you that we needed

818
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:54,340
that shit? Big thing

819
03:38:54,340 --> 03:38:57,540
that was upstairs.

820
03:38:57,540 --> 03:39:13,909
What was that though? What actually?

821
03:39:13,909 --> 03:39:27,989
More fun than Skyrim.

822
03:39:27,989 --> 03:39:29,989
There are clumps of hair

823
03:39:29,989 --> 03:39:32,420
falling out.

824
03:39:32,420 --> 03:39:34,420
Imagine that turn.

825
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:36,420
It looks like a big fucking clump of hair

826
03:39:36,420 --> 03:39:38,420
just falls. I turn over here.

827
03:39:38,420 --> 03:39:40,420
Huge clump of hair.

828
03:39:40,420 --> 03:39:42,659
I'm just bald in fucking five

829
03:39:42,659 --> 03:39:45,100
places.

830
03:39:45,100 --> 03:39:47,399
I will tell you this though.

831
03:39:47,399 --> 03:39:49,399
Do not fuck around in VR for this long

832
03:39:49,399 --> 03:39:51,399
because man, your hair is

833
03:39:51,399 --> 03:39:53,399
changed for a year.

834
03:39:53,399 --> 03:39:55,399
You wanna know why I do all the

835
03:39:55,399 --> 03:39:57,399
VR streams in a row?

836
03:39:57,399 --> 03:39:59,399
And we don't take any breaks?

837
03:39:59,399 --> 03:40:01,399
And it's like five, six, or seven

838
03:40:01,399 --> 03:40:03,399
VR streams in a row? Because this shit goes back

839
03:40:03,399 --> 03:40:05,399
in the closet because my hair

840
03:40:05,399 --> 03:40:07,399
is ruined for like two years.

841
03:40:07,399 --> 03:40:09,399
Until new hair

842
03:40:09,399 --> 03:40:16,440
grows back, it's ruined.

843
03:40:16,440 --> 03:40:21,500
Mallet, I got the mallet.

844
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:23,500
Hey, Templar, I fell in a fierce battle. The horror was

845
03:40:23,500 --> 03:40:25,500
laid bare by the light of a full moon.

846
03:40:25,500 --> 03:40:30,790
Alright, is that like

847
03:40:30,790 --> 03:40:32,790
Uncle Fester machine that you hold

848
03:40:32,790 --> 03:40:34,790
and it just vibrates your hands?

849
03:40:34,790 --> 03:40:37,030
By the way, I can

850
03:40:37,030 --> 03:40:39,030
do that shit on the highest setting and not let

851
03:40:39,030 --> 03:40:43,899
go. I actually did it recently.

852
03:40:43,899 --> 03:40:46,709
The thing that just goes

853
03:40:48,709 --> 03:40:50,709
and the thing laughs at you, I held it the entire

854
03:40:50,709 --> 03:40:55,000
time. You want? Ask

855
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,690
R.T. Gamecrub. He was literally

856
03:40:57,690 --> 03:40:59,690
in the room. Literally in the room

857
03:40:59,690 --> 03:41:01,690
while I'm sitting there just going, yeah,

858
03:41:01,690 --> 03:41:03,690
this don't even fucking hurt. And they all

859
03:41:03,690 --> 03:41:05,690
called me a psycho. Everybody was like, you're a psycho.

860
03:41:05,690 --> 03:41:07,690
You're a fucking weirdo. And I'm

861
03:41:07,690 --> 03:41:13,110
just like, good. Play

862
03:41:13,110 --> 03:41:15,110
Jump King. Alright, actually time that person out

863
03:41:15,110 --> 03:41:21,379
for five minutes. You are a weirdo.

864
03:41:21,379 --> 03:41:23,379
I'm not, why am I such a weirdo?

865
03:41:23,379 --> 03:41:31,879
Alright, let's go. Alright, because I

866
03:41:31,879 --> 03:41:33,879
can do the Uncle Fester machine thing?

867
03:41:33,879 --> 03:41:42,010
Old people use that machine.

868
03:41:42,010 --> 03:41:44,010
Guys, okay.

869
03:41:44,010 --> 03:41:46,950
You try it. You try it on easy when you see it

870
03:41:46,950 --> 03:41:51,620
next time. Next time you see that machine,

871
03:41:51,620 --> 03:41:53,620
I want you to do it on easy and then I want you to go,

872
03:41:53,620 --> 03:41:55,860
oh my god, Jerma's

873
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:57,860
so much stronger than I am. That machine

874
03:41:57,860 --> 03:42:07,209
fucking scared me.

875
03:42:07,209 --> 03:42:14,700
Oh wow. Boom!

876
03:42:14,700 --> 03:42:28,500
What do I do? Am I looking at this shit

877
03:42:28,500 --> 03:42:31,700
here? Am I paying attention to the banners?

878
03:42:31,700 --> 03:42:35,159
Oh, it was under the banner.

879
03:42:35,159 --> 03:42:37,159
It did fall. Under

880
03:42:37,159 --> 03:42:39,459
Taurus it called.

881
03:42:39,459 --> 03:42:41,459
Under Taurus it did

882
03:42:41,459 --> 03:42:43,459
call the banner that would show them all.

883
03:42:43,459 --> 03:42:45,459
Right? Whatever it is, the one banner

884
03:42:45,459 --> 03:42:47,459
to rule them all, Taurus is here

885
03:42:47,459 --> 03:42:49,459
to stall.

886
03:42:49,459 --> 03:42:53,989
This one? That one.

887
03:42:53,989 --> 03:43:01,540
Pumps of hair. You know what?

888
03:43:01,540 --> 03:43:03,540
Ah, quiet.

889
03:43:03,540 --> 03:43:05,540
I want you to, alright, the next like, I'm gonna

890
03:43:05,540 --> 03:43:07,540
I mean tomorrow we're doing VR but I don't know if I can

891
03:43:07,540 --> 03:43:09,540
do it by then. I'm gonna get like a bunch of

892
03:43:09,540 --> 03:43:11,540
fucking hair, like just like a wig and cut a bunch

893
03:43:11,540 --> 03:43:13,540
of hair out of the wig.

894
03:43:13,540 --> 03:43:15,540
Like the Halloween store and like

895
03:43:15,540 --> 03:43:17,540
get it in here and like have it be coming out

896
03:43:17,540 --> 03:43:22,280
and shit on stream. I don't

897
03:43:22,280 --> 03:43:24,280
know what this even means but apparently it's like under

898
03:43:24,280 --> 03:43:29,139
one of these banners. But I don't know

899
03:43:29,139 --> 03:43:39,579
what that mean.

900
03:43:39,579 --> 03:43:41,579
Somebody will get a good screenshot.

901
03:43:41,579 --> 03:43:43,579
Upside down, okay. I know what to do.

902
03:43:43,579 --> 03:43:46,459
Let's go. Banner that it would fall

903
03:43:46,459 --> 03:43:49,850
or whatever. That was important.

904
03:43:49,850 --> 03:44:00,860
Although we don't have a disc or anything over there.

905
03:44:00,860 --> 03:44:03,670
There's no disc.

906
03:44:03,670 --> 03:44:06,229
Bugpug. Full stream.

907
03:44:06,229 --> 03:44:16,729
And this is gonna put me in trouble. Cog

908
03:44:16,729 --> 03:44:23,129
goes where? Nice.

909
03:44:23,129 --> 03:44:26,200
Gonna have a huge indent on my

910
03:44:26,200 --> 03:44:30,420
face. It hurts. Oh, okay.

911
03:44:30,420 --> 03:44:32,659
Taurus at ten o'clock.

912
03:44:32,659 --> 03:44:36,500
It did fall.

913
03:44:36,500 --> 03:44:39,959
And ten o'clock

914
03:44:39,959 --> 03:44:41,959
to save us all.

915
03:44:41,959 --> 03:44:44,840
Or something. Whatever.

916
03:44:44,840 --> 03:44:53,219
No, it was eleven o'clock.

917
03:44:53,219 --> 03:44:55,459
And it was a full moon.

918
03:44:55,459 --> 03:44:58,149
Full moon.

919
03:44:58,149 --> 03:45:00,149
Taurus at ten.

920
03:45:00,149 --> 03:45:24,579
Oh, I gotta... What does that do, man?

921
03:45:24,579 --> 03:45:40,459
Let me get a close up

922
03:45:40,459 --> 03:45:42,459
view of this.

923
03:45:42,459 --> 03:45:45,850
That's... Okay.

924
03:45:45,850 --> 03:45:49,799
Oh, don't know where that

925
03:45:49,799 --> 03:45:52,420
goes. Oh, auto check. Auto.

926
03:45:52,420 --> 03:46:03,750
Right.

927
03:46:03,750 --> 03:46:13,590
Look at the other one. That's not gonna bounce.

928
03:46:13,590 --> 03:46:15,829
Bounce off that

929
03:46:15,829 --> 03:46:20,180
one. I don't have that one.

930
03:46:20,180 --> 03:46:24,219
Oh, the piano.

931
03:46:24,219 --> 03:46:26,780
The organ.

932
03:46:26,780 --> 03:46:40,899
The organ.

933
03:46:40,899 --> 03:46:46,600
Oh, okay. Here we go.

934
03:46:46,600 --> 03:46:50,629
So why is it so dark in here?

935
03:46:50,629 --> 03:46:55,690
Hold on. It's dark as hell in here.

936
03:46:55,690 --> 03:46:57,690
You guys get out. I'm just a silhouette in the

937
03:46:57,690 --> 03:47:20,260
room. Better.

938
03:47:20,260 --> 03:47:22,260
Wait. That's the question.

939
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:24,569
Wait, wait, wait. What is this?

940
03:47:24,569 --> 03:47:26,569
Germa, frankly, I...

941
03:47:26,569 --> 03:47:28,569
Germa, frankly, I find your avoidance of an answer to the

942
03:47:28,569 --> 03:47:30,569
question of slug poggins problematic.

943
03:47:30,569 --> 03:47:32,569
I've been an avid viewer of the channel for fifteen years

944
03:47:32,569 --> 03:47:34,569
and as such I can clearly see the great value of slug

945
03:47:34,569 --> 03:47:36,569
pog is brought to this channel. Please don't

946
03:47:36,569 --> 03:47:38,569
kill the slug pog. It holds us together. It's a sticky

947
03:47:38,569 --> 03:47:40,569
slug slime. It's being removed at the end

948
03:47:40,569 --> 03:47:42,569
of the stream. Like, I'm just gonna get rid of it. It's ugly.

949
03:47:42,569 --> 03:47:45,700
And it annoys everybody.

950
03:47:45,700 --> 03:47:47,700
It's being removed in about

951
03:47:47,700 --> 03:47:51,860
thirty to forty minutes.

952
03:47:51,860 --> 03:47:56,469
Or is it? Stay tuned. Find out. Or is it?

953
03:47:56,469 --> 03:48:09,829
Find out. I'm so scared to take

954
03:48:09,829 --> 03:48:13,930
this headband off. I really am.

955
03:48:13,930 --> 03:48:17,639
I'm scared that I'm gonna take this off

956
03:48:17,639 --> 03:48:19,639
and there's not gonna be anything underneath

957
03:48:19,639 --> 03:48:53,420
her. Oh!

958
03:48:53,420 --> 03:48:55,420
You know in the movie

959
03:48:55,420 --> 03:48:57,420
where the guy puts his hand on the

960
03:48:57,420 --> 03:48:59,420
ball in the class?

961
03:48:59,420 --> 03:49:02,940
In the science class?

962
03:49:02,940 --> 03:49:04,940
It's not even a movie. It's just in class.

963
03:49:04,940 --> 03:49:07,690
That's not

964
03:49:07,690 --> 03:49:09,690
coming back for a while.

965
03:49:09,690 --> 03:49:19,799
I'm in a lot of trouble now.

966
03:49:19,799 --> 03:49:22,299
Oh my

967
03:49:22,299 --> 03:49:24,299
fucking

968
03:49:24,299 --> 03:49:26,299
God!

969
03:49:26,299 --> 03:49:40,629
Oh!

970
03:49:40,629 --> 03:49:52,979
Ray man!

971
03:49:52,979 --> 03:49:54,979
It looks like it hurts. And it does.

972
03:49:54,979 --> 03:49:56,979
Trust me when I say it fucking hurts.

973
03:49:56,979 --> 03:49:58,979
You can't do VR. It's not possible.

974
03:49:58,979 --> 03:50:00,979
This is why it's never gonna take off.

975
03:50:00,979 --> 03:50:02,979
One point eight percent of people on

976
03:50:02,979 --> 03:50:04,979
Steam have VR.

977
03:50:04,979 --> 03:50:07,780
Do you want this to happen to you?

978
03:50:07,780 --> 03:50:09,780
No you don't. You don't want to look like this.

979
03:50:09,780 --> 03:50:13,110
You don't want to like

980
03:50:13,110 --> 03:50:15,110
lose the top fucking part of your

981
03:50:15,110 --> 03:50:25,159
hair? You're using the five

982
03:50:25,159 --> 03:50:27,159
year old outdated

983
03:50:27,159 --> 03:50:29,159
I can't even take myself seriously.

984
03:50:29,159 --> 03:50:35,180
You can see the scalp.

985
03:50:35,180 --> 03:50:37,180
I've ruined my fucking

986
03:50:37,180 --> 03:50:39,180
head. This is gonna take

987
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:41,180
years for this to come back normally.

988
03:50:41,180 --> 03:50:43,180
This is gonna take a decade. And by

989
03:50:43,180 --> 03:50:45,180
a decade by the way I'll be 45

990
03:50:45,180 --> 03:50:47,180
and it'll just be gone anyways.

991
03:50:47,180 --> 03:50:55,690
Brush it? No! I'm not

992
03:50:55,690 --> 03:50:59,780
brushing it. I'm not brushing it.

993
03:50:59,780 --> 03:51:01,780
I'm gonna go in the bath and I'm gonna hold my head underwater

994
03:51:01,780 --> 03:51:09,209
and put a conditioner in my hair. This is a

995
03:51:09,209 --> 03:51:12,790
chaotic stream.

996
03:51:12,790 --> 03:51:14,790
Okay, ready?

997
03:51:14,790 --> 03:51:32,629
Would you swipe right?

998
03:51:32,629 --> 03:51:34,629
That's the

999
03:51:34,629 --> 03:51:36,940
guy that you accidentally super like.

1000
03:51:36,940 --> 03:51:38,940
And you go

1001
03:51:38,940 --> 03:51:42,139
Oh fuck.

1002
03:51:42,139 --> 03:51:45,450
Are you super like

1003
03:51:45,450 --> 03:51:47,450
me? What was it?

1004
03:51:47,450 --> 03:51:49,450
You like me a lot apparently.

1005
03:51:49,450 --> 03:51:51,450
Do you like to go on a date?

1006
03:51:51,450 --> 03:52:02,069
No, Rayman.

1007
03:52:02,069 --> 03:52:04,069
Rayman was the best.

1008
03:52:04,069 --> 03:52:06,069
Rayman is the best description.

1009
03:52:06,069 --> 03:52:08,500
I really like this

1010
03:52:08,500 --> 03:52:10,500
view. I feel

1011
03:52:10,500 --> 03:52:12,500
pretty confident right now.

1012
03:52:12,500 --> 03:52:14,739
Remember me? German985.

1013
03:52:14,739 --> 03:52:16,739
Good to meet you.

1014
03:52:16,739 --> 03:52:18,739
That's me. Welcome to the stream.

1015
03:52:18,739 --> 03:52:21,180
I'm pretty handsome. I'm a pretty handsome guy.

1016
03:52:21,180 --> 03:52:27,620
Don't you think?

1017
03:52:27,620 --> 03:52:29,620
I made it

1018
03:52:29,620 --> 03:52:33,209
worse. It's dead.

1019
03:52:33,209 --> 03:52:35,209
It's actually all dead hair.

1020
03:52:35,209 --> 03:52:39,110
It's a bird's nest. Let the

1021
03:52:39,110 --> 03:52:45,190
light hit it. Somebody fucking electrocuted

1022
03:52:45,190 --> 03:52:49,989
me. Take the shirt off.

1023
03:52:49,989 --> 03:52:55,750
Like that'll help.

1024
03:52:55,750 --> 03:52:57,750
I don't even want to touch it. It's gonna all fall off.

1025
03:52:57,750 --> 03:53:08,760
Imagine if I actually

1026
03:53:08,760 --> 03:53:18,170
pulled a clump.

1027
03:53:18,170 --> 03:53:20,170
Upside down. Hey, show feet.

1028
03:53:20,170 --> 03:53:24,139
Is that really what you're asking

1029
03:53:24,139 --> 03:53:26,139
right now? After this?

1030
03:53:26,139 --> 03:53:40,149
That's what you're asking.

1031
03:53:40,149 --> 03:53:42,149
I gotta cut it all off.

1032
03:53:42,149 --> 03:53:56,090
In VR.

1033
03:53:56,090 --> 03:54:03,639
Alright, let's get in here and do the organ.

1034
03:54:03,639 --> 03:54:07,159
You gonna do the castanza?

1035
03:54:07,159 --> 03:54:09,159
I thought the headband was gonna help. The headband

1036
03:54:09,159 --> 03:54:18,889
might have actually made it worse.

1037
03:54:18,889 --> 03:54:26,569
Get down. Your hair is fine.

1038
03:54:26,569 --> 03:54:44,090
Let's go.

1039
03:54:44,090 --> 03:54:46,260
Where the heck am I?

1040
03:54:46,260 --> 03:54:48,700
Where the heck am I? I can't see anything.

1041
03:54:48,700 --> 03:54:50,700
This is fucking really immersive.

1042
03:54:52,700 --> 03:54:54,700
Today I hit the fucking thing.

1043
03:54:54,700 --> 03:54:56,700
It didn't even work. I was trying to...

1044
03:54:56,700 --> 03:54:59,579
Are those glued to the wall?

1045
03:54:59,579 --> 03:55:14,100
It's been baby-proofed.

1046
03:55:14,100 --> 03:55:17,690
What the hell are we doing before I

1047
03:55:17,690 --> 03:55:19,690
panicked about my appearance?

1048
03:55:19,690 --> 03:55:21,690
Like how my hair is gone?

1049
03:55:21,690 --> 03:55:23,989
I'm gonna leave conditioner in my hair.

1050
03:55:23,989 --> 03:55:25,989
I'm going to play Half-Life Alex tomorrow.

1051
03:55:25,989 --> 03:55:28,940
I'll be lucky if there's anything left.

1052
03:55:28,940 --> 03:55:42,500
Bald. Bald. Wear a wig.

1053
03:55:42,500 --> 03:55:44,809
Why not try a beanie?

1054
03:55:44,809 --> 03:55:46,809
I tried a beanie before and my head was sweating

1055
03:55:46,809 --> 03:55:48,809
so much that I got

1056
03:55:48,809 --> 03:55:50,809
zits all over my forehead.

1057
03:55:50,809 --> 03:55:53,049
All over my face.

1058
03:55:53,049 --> 03:55:55,860
I had zits in my hair.

1059
03:55:55,860 --> 03:55:57,860
I remember being like, ow, fucking

1060
03:55:57,860 --> 03:56:00,870
zits.

1061
03:56:00,870 --> 03:56:02,870
VR sucks.

1062
03:56:02,870 --> 03:56:08,309
Okay?

1063
03:56:08,309 --> 03:56:10,309
It's just do a cool thing

1064
03:56:10,309 --> 03:56:18,059
and torture yourself.

1065
03:56:18,059 --> 03:56:20,059
VR fucking sucks.

1066
03:56:20,059 --> 03:56:23,260
It's so cool.

1067
03:56:23,260 --> 03:56:25,879
It's so much fun.

1068
03:56:25,879 --> 03:56:27,879
But holy shit, you lose like

1069
03:56:27,879 --> 03:56:29,879
three months of your life every time you play it.

1070
03:56:29,879 --> 03:56:32,889
Alright, let's do this.

1071
03:56:32,889 --> 03:56:38,899
Oh, up the stairs, right? Yeah.

1072
03:56:38,899 --> 03:56:43,700
How do we get back up there? Anybody

1073
03:56:43,700 --> 03:56:50,600
remember?

1074
03:56:50,600 --> 03:56:54,059
Okay. Popper?

1075
03:56:54,059 --> 03:56:57,319
Thank you. Popper? Thank you.

1076
03:56:57,319 --> 03:57:19,959
Oh. Oh, nice.

1077
03:57:19,959 --> 03:57:37,219
Oh. Oh, shit.

1078
03:57:37,219 --> 03:57:48,729
I think it is.

1079
03:57:48,729 --> 03:57:50,729
What the heck?

1080
03:57:50,729 --> 03:58:06,579
Bull.

1081
03:58:06,579 --> 03:58:10,360
How do I get over there? Bice is over there. How do I get over there?

1082
03:58:10,360 --> 03:58:20,459
Okay. Um.

1083
03:58:20,459 --> 03:58:33,750
Do I get out? Bro, what the heck?

1084
03:58:33,750 --> 03:58:58,120
I don't know what I just did. Wait a minute.

1085
03:58:58,120 --> 03:59:04,139
The hell did I just do? What is this doing?

1086
03:59:04,139 --> 03:59:10,899
Whoa. What's going on over there?

1087
03:59:10,899 --> 03:59:28,739
Uh.

1088
03:59:28,739 --> 03:59:33,590
Hat. Hat with a hat?

1089
03:59:33,590 --> 03:59:41,829
What are you talking about? Rat Pog. Rat Pog.

1090
03:59:41,829 --> 03:59:43,829
Did all of them just face the same direction like that?

1091
03:59:43,829 --> 03:59:46,139
Yeah, did they just face the same

1092
03:59:46,139 --> 03:59:48,819
direction like that? Rat in the hat.

1093
03:59:48,819 --> 04:00:03,610
Where's the rat in the hat?

1094
04:00:03,610 --> 04:00:08,790
Do you not see the rat in the hat?

1095
04:00:08,790 --> 04:00:16,090
Oh, dude. What are you guys talking about?

1096
04:00:16,090 --> 04:00:18,090
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on.

1097
04:00:18,090 --> 04:00:29,780
That's where I'm standing, right?

1098
04:00:29,780 --> 04:00:35,139
Um. Did I get one that can

1099
04:00:35,139 --> 04:00:54,200
turn? I have no idea.

1100
04:00:54,200 --> 04:00:59,750
I don't know. At behind you.

1101
04:00:59,750 --> 04:01:06,979
I think Xanax feels like

1102
04:01:06,979 --> 04:01:08,979
the game audio is muted?

1103
04:01:08,979 --> 04:01:15,959
No, it's not.

1104
04:01:15,959 --> 04:01:19,739
Wait. Like that?

1105
04:01:19,739 --> 04:01:21,739
That's not right. This is not right.

1106
04:01:21,739 --> 04:01:26,219
I don't know. We're going back in.

1107
04:01:26,219 --> 04:01:40,409
What am I doing? Oh, that's the shell.

1108
04:01:40,409 --> 04:01:57,219
Ooh. Holy shit.

1109
04:01:57,219 --> 04:01:59,219
Okay, cool. I got it. I figured it out.

1110
04:01:59,219 --> 04:02:01,219
No, I didn't. Fuck. It's gotta be a shorter one.

1111
04:02:01,219 --> 04:02:03,219
Okay. It's gotta be a short

1112
04:02:03,219 --> 04:02:05,459
one. This one is correct.

1113
04:02:05,459 --> 04:02:08,469
Kind of. So it's this

1114
04:02:08,469 --> 04:02:10,469
whatever one is right here, that's correct.

1115
04:02:10,469 --> 04:02:12,469
But that one isn't. It's gotta be this one

1116
04:02:12,469 --> 04:02:19,059
there. Let's go.

1117
04:02:19,059 --> 04:02:23,479
Oh, that's correct.

1118
04:02:23,479 --> 04:02:25,979
Another one of those. That one right

1119
04:02:25,979 --> 04:02:30,139
there. Put that one right there.

1120
04:02:30,139 --> 04:02:33,379
How about that one?

1121
04:02:33,379 --> 04:02:43,110
How about that one, folks?

1122
04:02:43,110 --> 04:03:14,090
That was wrong. Poor hair.

1123
04:03:14,090 --> 04:03:18,889
I'm so sad about it.

1124
04:03:18,889 --> 04:03:28,620
Why is this... I can't...

1125
04:03:28,620 --> 04:03:59,700
Why can I not spin it anymore?

1126
04:03:59,700 --> 04:04:11,139
Exit right there.

1127
04:04:11,139 --> 04:04:16,389
Exit right there? I can't...

1128
04:04:16,389 --> 04:04:33,350
I don't know. I'm there.

1129
04:04:33,350 --> 04:04:41,530
I need a lip. Is there an even shorter one?

1130
04:04:41,530 --> 04:05:13,579
Wait, is that not it? Open it!

1131
04:05:13,579 --> 04:05:15,579
Spin them back around. Yeah, I

1132
04:05:15,579 --> 04:05:19,420
can't. I can't touch the wheel.

1133
04:05:19,420 --> 04:05:27,860
Walked in place. It's probably just one of these

1134
04:05:27,860 --> 04:05:30,620
weird ones here. But I got an idea.

1135
04:05:30,620 --> 04:05:46,069
That one. That'd be this one here.

1136
04:05:46,069 --> 04:06:03,399
Hey, any of these?

1137
04:06:03,399 --> 04:06:31,420
It's none of them! It's none of them!

1138
04:06:31,420 --> 04:07:19,860
The wreck pipe is missing? Whose pipe

1139
04:07:19,860 --> 04:07:46,729
over here? Give me it.

1140
04:07:46,729 --> 04:07:53,500
How do I get it? Give me the pipe.

1141
04:07:53,500 --> 04:08:06,809
Give me that pipe. Hey, please.

1142
04:08:06,809 --> 04:08:08,809
Come on, this is starting to run a little thin.

1143
04:08:08,809 --> 04:08:10,809
Also, already...

1144
04:08:10,809 --> 04:08:13,239
Your other left?

1145
04:08:13,239 --> 04:08:32,809
Okay. This is...

1146
04:08:32,809 --> 04:08:34,809
If I'm looking at it like this is the right

1147
04:08:34,809 --> 04:08:36,809
side...

1148
04:08:36,809 --> 04:08:41,989
Dude, this is starting to get a little

1149
04:08:41,989 --> 04:08:46,790
thin.

1150
04:08:46,790 --> 04:08:48,790
Which one? Where is it?

1151
04:08:48,790 --> 04:08:56,219
That one here? Or is it one more?

1152
04:08:56,219 --> 04:09:04,020
Hey, dude, German, this is like

1153
04:09:04,020 --> 04:09:06,020
starting to get a little thin.

1154
04:09:06,020 --> 04:09:12,229
God damn it.

1155
04:09:12,229 --> 04:09:22,389
Give me this.

1156
04:09:22,389 --> 04:09:24,389
You know, this joke is kind of

1157
04:09:24,389 --> 04:09:26,389
running a little thin.

1158
04:09:26,389 --> 04:09:31,450
Okay. Very cool.

1159
04:09:31,450 --> 04:09:33,450
Very fun. Awesome.

1160
04:09:33,450 --> 04:09:35,450
Sick.

1161
04:09:35,450 --> 04:09:40,120
It's done. Stop saying that, please.

1162
04:09:40,120 --> 04:10:19,209
What the fuck did you say?

1163
04:10:19,209 --> 04:10:26,379
Nice. That's so cool.

1164
04:10:26,379 --> 04:10:28,379
Well, that's the bellows, and then this is another bellows.

1165
04:10:28,379 --> 04:10:30,379
The two bellows, and that should turn it back

1166
04:10:30,379 --> 04:10:38,250
on.

1167
04:10:38,250 --> 04:10:52,059
Play the piano.

1168
04:10:52,059 --> 04:10:54,059
He said it. He finally said it.

1169
04:10:54,059 --> 04:10:56,229
He did it.

1170
04:10:56,229 --> 04:10:58,229
He finally said the thing.

1171
04:10:58,229 --> 04:11:00,790
Said Munkah S.

1172
04:11:00,790 --> 04:11:08,520
Is this a dumb thing?

1173
04:11:08,520 --> 04:11:15,940
Play it. Piano time.

1174
04:11:15,940 --> 04:11:54,649
Come to my opera.

1175
04:11:54,649 --> 04:12:33,159
Wait, wait, wait! There's not enough keys!

1176
04:12:33,159 --> 04:12:56,840
I can't play it.

1177
04:12:56,840 --> 04:12:58,840
Hey, hey! Remember this one, guys?

1178
04:12:58,840 --> 04:13:02,149
Summer lovin'.

1179
04:13:02,149 --> 04:13:04,709
Had me a blast.

1180
04:13:04,709 --> 04:13:07,659
Summer lovin'.

1181
04:13:07,659 --> 04:13:09,829
Happened so fast.

1182
04:13:09,829 --> 04:13:11,829
I met a girl. Cutest could be.

1183
04:13:11,829 --> 04:13:15,530
Met a fo-

1184
04:13:15,530 --> 04:13:18,090
Cutest could be.

1185
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:37,590
Summer!

1186
04:13:37,590 --> 04:13:47,959
Fucking hate it. Okay, let's go.

1187
04:13:47,959 --> 04:13:59,100
Look at this shit.

1188
04:13:59,100 --> 04:14:01,100
This is a really, really weird way to teach you how to

1189
04:14:01,100 --> 04:14:08,579
play the piano. Oh, I lost the ball.

1190
04:14:08,579 --> 04:14:20,540
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Okay, now

1191
04:14:20,540 --> 04:14:27,559
it's gotta go down there. Shit!

1192
04:14:27,559 --> 04:14:29,559
This is fucking hard. Okay, I need one

1193
04:14:29,559 --> 04:15:03,420
hand. It's fucking high!

1194
04:15:03,420 --> 04:15:05,420
The black keys?

1195
04:15:05,420 --> 04:15:23,659
What? Oh, shit.

1196
04:15:23,659 --> 04:15:43,879
Get this off. Get it off the screen.

1197
04:15:43,879 --> 04:16:01,209
I have a new ball. Alright, it's gotta

1198
04:16:01,209 --> 04:16:04,659
go down. I need it to line up

1199
04:16:04,659 --> 04:16:15,989
right. No, fuck! I didn't wanna do that.

1200
04:16:15,989 --> 04:16:32,889
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1201
04:16:32,889 --> 04:16:37,620
I wanna see at least one

1202
04:16:37,620 --> 04:16:39,930
pogchamp. I need- I want at least one

1203
04:16:39,930 --> 04:16:47,030
pogchamp for that one. One more. All the way

1204
04:16:47,030 --> 04:17:19,659
over here. Hey, hold on.

1205
04:17:19,659 --> 04:17:25,219
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it!

1206
04:17:25,219 --> 04:17:27,219
What do you guys have to say about that?

1207
04:17:27,219 --> 04:17:32,729
Ooh, we can't do it.

1208
04:17:32,729 --> 04:17:35,350
That shit. I'll take it and

1209
04:17:35,350 --> 04:17:37,350
that's the completion of that fucking room right there,

1210
04:17:37,350 --> 04:17:45,850
folks. Here we go.

1211
04:17:45,850 --> 04:17:47,850
Now we just gotta line that up. That's red,

1212
04:17:47,850 --> 04:17:49,850
blue, and green.

1213
04:17:49,850 --> 04:18:02,520
Funko viewers? What?

1214
04:18:02,520 --> 04:18:05,719
The Funko

1215
04:18:05,719 --> 04:18:08,090
viewers. Okay, red, blue, and

1216
04:18:08,090 --> 04:18:15,510
green. Here we go.

1217
04:18:15,510 --> 04:18:17,879
Red, blue, and green. Oh.

1218
04:18:17,879 --> 04:18:19,879
Red, blue, and green.

1219
04:18:19,879 --> 04:18:25,899
Red, blue, and green.

1220
04:18:25,899 --> 04:18:27,899
Red, blue, and green.

1221
04:18:27,899 --> 04:18:31,799
How about Abadoo

1222
04:18:31,799 --> 04:18:43,829
right there, I think.

1223
04:18:43,829 --> 04:18:54,139
Red, blue, and green.

1224
04:18:54,139 --> 04:18:57,959
Green. Green.

1225
04:18:57,959 --> 04:19:19,510
What's wrong with it?

1226
04:19:19,510 --> 04:19:26,340
What's wrong with it?

1227
04:19:26,340 --> 04:19:28,340
Hey, this looks super cool. This is

1228
04:19:28,340 --> 04:19:37,500
this is

1229
04:19:37,500 --> 04:19:39,989
for my fucking loyal viewers,

1230
04:19:39,989 --> 04:19:41,989
this is the Room

1231
04:19:41,989 --> 04:19:44,360
VR. Now,

1232
04:19:44,360 --> 04:19:46,360
the Room VR is an offshoot

1233
04:19:46,360 --> 04:19:48,360
of the Room the Video

1234
04:19:48,360 --> 04:19:50,360
Game series. The series of

1235
04:19:50,360 --> 04:19:52,360
puzzle boxes. One of

1236
04:19:52,360 --> 04:19:54,360
the most fun iPad games

1237
04:19:54,360 --> 04:19:56,360
that they ported to Steam. I know you

1238
04:19:56,360 --> 04:19:58,360
know that. You're my guy.

1239
04:19:58,360 --> 04:20:02,780
Check it out. This is called the Room.

1240
04:20:02,780 --> 04:20:07,379
It's on Steam. I don't know

1241
04:20:07,379 --> 04:20:09,379
okay, I was just gonna throw this against the wall

1242
04:20:09,379 --> 04:20:11,379
and this thing's like, this thing's worth like

1243
04:20:11,379 --> 04:20:15,350
fucking 60 bucks. Does it have like a

1244
04:20:15,350 --> 04:20:18,170
price tag on it?

1245
04:20:18,170 --> 04:20:36,260
That was tricky. It paid

1246
04:20:36,260 --> 04:20:38,260
$50, but it's worth $40.

1247
04:20:38,260 --> 04:20:41,909
Okay, so how's this wrong?

1248
04:20:41,909 --> 04:20:44,219
That looks real, that looks correct.

1249
04:20:44,219 --> 04:20:47,100
Am I, if she was shining

1250
04:20:47,100 --> 04:20:50,420
at the wrong person? That looks

1251
04:20:50,420 --> 04:20:56,250
right to me.

1252
04:20:56,250 --> 04:21:05,850
What's the deal? I just did that.

1253
04:21:05,850 --> 04:21:09,940
Alright, now we're gonna do one more. This one is

1254
04:21:09,940 --> 04:21:21,639
in there, what? Upside down.

1255
04:21:21,639 --> 04:21:34,739
And red. And then we got

1256
04:21:34,739 --> 04:21:36,739
a little bit of

1257
04:21:36,739 --> 04:21:43,959
and red. Dine it.

1258
04:21:43,959 --> 04:22:00,969
Oh, it's burning the shield.

1259
04:22:00,969 --> 04:22:02,969
Rat in the hat chat. There's no rat in the hat.

1260
04:22:02,969 --> 04:22:26,250
Aha.

1261
04:22:26,250 --> 04:22:31,750
Fuck does this mean? All gonna be facing the same

1262
04:22:31,750 --> 04:22:34,120
direction kind of? Okay.

1263
04:22:34,120 --> 04:22:45,690
It's gotta be, did I fuck it up already?

1264
04:22:45,690 --> 04:23:11,190
Bingo. That's it.

1265
04:23:11,190 --> 04:23:16,309
Okay, now, oh shit.

1266
04:23:16,309 --> 04:23:18,309
Is this listed somewhere?

1267
04:23:18,309 --> 04:23:20,809
Do we have a list of this somewhere?

1268
04:23:20,809 --> 04:23:23,559
Yeah, okay.

1269
04:23:23,559 --> 04:23:25,559
Top right is hourglass.

1270
04:23:25,559 --> 04:23:32,659
Right there is

1271
04:23:32,659 --> 04:23:35,399
uh, pizza.

1272
04:23:35,399 --> 04:23:38,649
Already there. Then we got

1273
04:23:38,649 --> 04:23:43,129
a blade. It's already there.

1274
04:23:43,129 --> 04:23:53,739
And then we got, then we got

1275
04:23:53,739 --> 04:24:01,590
infinity. Finally,

1276
04:24:01,590 --> 04:24:12,389
illuminati. Oh.

1277
04:24:12,389 --> 04:24:15,270
Final one.

1278
04:24:15,270 --> 04:24:17,639
Yellow, yellow, white,

1279
04:24:17,639 --> 04:24:20,329
blue. We have to be in night vision

1280
04:24:20,329 --> 04:24:22,329
for this one. Freak mode, whatever

1281
04:24:22,329 --> 04:24:29,299
it's called. What was it again?

1282
04:24:29,299 --> 04:24:35,299
Yellow, green, blue.

1283
04:24:35,299 --> 04:24:40,409
I don't remember. Yellow, blue

1284
04:24:40,409 --> 04:24:43,479
and green. Yellow, yellow,

1285
04:24:43,479 --> 04:24:52,440
white and blue. White

1286
04:24:52,440 --> 04:25:03,239
and blue. Dine it. Right up

1287
04:25:03,239 --> 04:25:14,950
into the ceiling. Oh, it's a staircase.

1288
04:25:14,950 --> 04:25:17,829
Guys, it's a staircase.

1289
04:25:17,829 --> 04:25:20,389
It's a staircase.

1290
04:25:20,389 --> 04:25:31,079
Okay, a what?

1291
04:25:31,079 --> 04:25:44,819
Oh, cobwebs.

1292
04:25:44,819 --> 04:25:46,819
I hear it in the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It crawls all over this place.

1293
04:25:46,819 --> 04:25:48,819
Through it, under it. They are waiting.

1294
04:25:48,819 --> 04:25:50,819
I hear them. Spider's a boss or something?

1295
04:25:50,819 --> 04:25:52,819
Boss fight?

1296
04:25:52,819 --> 04:26:13,290
I don't wanna go in there.

1297
04:26:13,290 --> 04:26:44,200
That dude's in there. Say it?

1298
04:26:44,200 --> 04:26:46,200
Say it. No, I'm not gonna say it.

1299
04:26:46,200 --> 04:26:51,770
Only one more remains.

1300
04:26:51,770 --> 04:27:05,909
I hope the reverend found his

1301
04:27:05,909 --> 04:27:07,909
piece in the end. One more artifact to recover

1302
04:27:07,909 --> 04:27:09,909
before I have all I need to bring these forces

1303
04:27:09,909 --> 04:27:11,909
to heal. One more and I will release you

1304
04:27:11,909 --> 04:27:14,600
from your task. The last

1305
04:27:14,600 --> 04:27:16,600
soul thinks her twigs and roots will let her

1306
04:27:16,600 --> 04:27:18,600
dabble in worlds beyond her own.

1307
04:27:18,600 --> 04:27:20,600
She has no idea what she is meddling

1308
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:32,549
with. Who is it?

1309
04:27:32,549 --> 04:27:34,549
Lady from Resi- uh...

1310
04:27:34,549 --> 04:27:42,469
Grandma from Resident Evil.

1311
04:27:42,469 --> 04:27:44,469
I said this was the- actually, this is the Resident Evil

1312
04:27:44,469 --> 04:27:48,250
fucking seven house.

1313
04:27:48,250 --> 04:27:50,250
This is actually the Resident Evil seven house.

1314
04:27:50,250 --> 04:27:58,489
Same layout.

1315
04:27:58,489 --> 04:28:00,489
Sure!

1316
04:28:00,489 --> 04:28:02,489
It's all okay. I'm sorry I made a shitty joke

1317
04:28:02,489 --> 04:28:04,489
and I punched you right in the face.

1318
04:28:04,489 --> 04:28:07,299
Oh, we get to make something!

1319
04:28:07,299 --> 04:28:09,540
Turkey! Okay, we gotta make

1320
04:28:09,540 --> 04:28:12,489
food. Ingredients, we get ingredients in

1321
04:28:12,489 --> 04:28:20,219
there. What else is in here?

1322
04:28:20,219 --> 04:28:34,739
Herd? What is this?

1323
04:28:34,739 --> 04:28:43,899
I'm gonna make a potion, eventually

1324
04:28:43,899 --> 04:28:45,899
here. Now, what else?

1325
04:28:45,899 --> 04:28:51,059
Also- oh.

1326
04:28:51,059 --> 04:29:03,399
Ayo.

1327
04:29:03,399 --> 04:29:05,399
The butcher arrives. When blind

1328
04:29:05,399 --> 04:29:07,399
to their master's shadow, even as the rod of

1329
04:29:07,399 --> 04:29:09,399
deceit rises off them, they

1330
04:29:09,399 --> 04:29:11,399
like a thousand burning embers.

1331
04:29:11,399 --> 04:29:13,399
He deceives them with- uh...

1332
04:29:13,399 --> 04:29:46,920
go to me.

1333
04:29:46,920 --> 04:29:59,639
Uh, I- I have to stop.

1334
04:29:59,639 --> 04:30:02,139
I have to stop. I have to.

1335
04:30:02,139 --> 04:30:10,440
I'm sorry. It's too- it's

1336
04:30:10,440 --> 04:30:12,440
my vibe- look at me.

1337
04:30:12,440 --> 04:30:17,030
Look at me.

1338
04:30:17,030 --> 04:30:21,829
I look like I have a sunburn!

1339
04:30:21,829 --> 04:30:23,829
Like, I was- I got too much sun!

1340
04:30:23,829 --> 04:30:30,739
I have a burn on my-

1341
04:30:30,739 --> 04:30:32,739
I have a burn on my face.

1342
04:30:32,739 --> 04:30:39,020
I have to- I gotta replace

1343
04:30:39,020 --> 04:30:41,020
this fucking thing. It's- it's horrible.

1344
04:30:41,020 --> 04:30:44,600
Take off the headband.

1345
04:30:44,600 --> 04:30:49,959
Mmm.

1346
04:30:49,959 --> 04:30:52,389
Radiation.

1347
04:30:52,389 --> 04:30:54,389
Yeah, man, VR is really fucking

1348
04:30:54,389 --> 04:30:56,389
cool. But- ah

1349
04:30:56,389 --> 04:30:58,389
God, I just wish there wasn't so much

1350
04:30:58,389 --> 04:31:07,219
radiation. It really does

1351
04:31:07,219 --> 04:31:09,219
look like a radiation burn.

1352
04:31:09,219 --> 04:31:13,450
Wha- how much radiation

1353
04:31:13,450 --> 04:31:15,450
is in a VR headset?

1354
04:31:15,450 --> 04:31:17,450
Did we know? Does anybody know what-

1355
04:31:17,450 --> 04:31:19,450
how much radiation evitst from here?

1356
04:31:19,450 --> 04:31:24,819
Alright, everybody wants it.

1357
04:31:24,819 --> 04:31:29,620
Sure, I'll- okay.

1358
04:31:29,620 --> 04:31:38,389
Get this in HD.

1359
04:31:38,389 --> 04:32:11,670
Here comes a headband reveal.

1360
04:32:11,670 --> 04:32:13,670
My- my career is over.

1361
04:32:13,670 --> 04:32:15,670
My- my looks are over. It's over.

1362
04:32:15,670 --> 04:32:17,670
It's over.

1363
04:32:17,670 --> 04:32:21,319
It's over.

1364
04:32:21,319 --> 04:32:38,920
It's- my poor hair.

1365
04:32:38,920 --> 04:32:40,920
Oh, my poor hair.

1366
04:32:40,920 --> 04:32:45,590
Mmm.

1367
04:32:45,590 --> 04:32:50,969
It was already so damaged

1368
04:32:50,969 --> 04:32:54,299
from the last few VRs.

1369
04:32:54,299 --> 04:32:56,299
Save it. Save it! I can- I'm gonna try.

1370
04:32:56,299 --> 04:32:58,659
I'm gonna try.

1371
04:32:58,659 --> 04:33:07,180
Ah. It'll bounce.

1372
04:33:07,180 --> 04:33:09,180
I'm not gonna bleach it. Look at how-

1373
04:33:09,180 --> 04:33:11,180
look at how fucking crazy this looks.

1374
04:33:11,180 --> 04:33:13,849
Wear a hat.

1375
04:33:13,849 --> 04:33:16,470
I- this is what I did this for!

1376
04:33:16,470 --> 04:33:18,470
So it would be, like, out of my head.

1377
04:33:18,470 --> 04:33:20,470
I'll wear a hat in VR?

1378
04:33:20,470 --> 04:33:25,590
I'll die in there.

1379
04:33:25,590 --> 04:33:27,590
I'll die in there if I wear a hat.

1380
04:33:27,590 --> 04:33:45,509
I'm not gonna shave my head.

1381
04:33:45,509 --> 04:33:53,639
No, I don't even shave it.

1382
04:33:53,639 --> 04:33:55,819
It's just- it's just all

1383
04:33:55,819 --> 04:34:01,319
dead. Look, my hairline's really

1384
04:34:01,319 --> 04:34:03,319
not that bad. It really isn't. You know, I had

1385
04:34:03,319 --> 04:34:05,319
a person at the salon told me,

1386
04:34:05,319 --> 04:34:07,319
Jeremy, you got another seven to ten years of that

1387
04:34:07,319 --> 04:34:18,500
hair. Alright.

1388
04:34:18,500 --> 04:34:21,450
That's it? I mean, that's it.

1389
04:34:21,450 --> 04:34:24,330
I'm thirty-five. You mean I get

1390
04:34:24,330 --> 04:34:26,330
to keep my hair till I'm, like, forty-five years old?

1391
04:34:26,330 --> 04:34:29,270
That's pretty sick, actually.

1392
04:34:29,270 --> 04:34:34,069
Seven to ten hours.

1393
04:34:34,069 --> 04:34:37,080
Oh, it's so- it's so beat up.

1394
04:34:37,080 --> 04:34:39,080
Oh, man.

1395
04:34:39,080 --> 04:34:41,080
No. No.

1396
04:34:41,080 --> 04:34:43,450
It's okay. I'm gonna go- okay, I'm

1397
04:34:43,450 --> 04:34:45,450
gonna go condition my hair right now.

1398
04:34:45,450 --> 04:34:47,450
I'm gonna go just condition my hair and leave it in for, like,

1399
04:34:47,450 --> 04:34:49,819
an hour. And I'm gonna play Half-Life

1400
04:34:49,819 --> 04:34:52,060
Alex tomorrow with, like-

1401
04:34:52,060 --> 04:34:54,549
Can I do, like, a- can I-

1402
04:34:54,549 --> 04:34:56,549
Can I have, like, a VR, like, surrogate- like,

1403
04:34:56,549 --> 04:34:58,549
can somebody be in the machine for me and I'll just

1404
04:34:58,549 --> 04:35:08,279
do commentary? Alright, I gotta

1405
04:35:08,279 --> 04:35:12,889
get out of here. Uh, I really

1406
04:35:12,889 --> 04:35:14,889
wanted to finish the room, too, but

1407
04:35:14,889 --> 04:35:17,509
no. No, it's time

1408
04:35:17,509 --> 04:35:22,500
to stop.

1409
04:35:22,500 --> 04:35:26,860
Sorry for the technical problems in the first

1410
04:35:26,860 --> 04:35:28,860
hour or so. It wasn't my

1411
04:35:28,860 --> 04:35:30,860
fault. We played, we were good.

1412
04:35:30,860 --> 04:35:33,799
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1413
04:35:33,799 --> 04:35:37,049
Have a good rest of your night.

1414
04:35:37,049 --> 04:35:39,049
I forgot about Otto. He's right here. He's just lying down.

1415
04:35:39,049 --> 04:35:42,700
I fucking- it hurts up

1416
04:35:42,700 --> 04:35:44,700
there. I- what should I do?

1417
04:35:44,700 --> 04:35:47,189
Salt?

1418
04:35:47,189 --> 04:35:49,189
Put, like, sea salt on it or something to make it so

1419
04:35:49,189 --> 04:35:51,189
it, like, calms the hair follicles down up there?

1420
04:35:51,189 --> 04:36:00,540
What should I do? I'm not gonna put bleach

1421
04:36:00,540 --> 04:36:04,500
in my hair. Oil?

1422
04:36:04,500 --> 04:36:06,500
Maybe some olive oil? Alright, I'm gonna- yeah, yeah,

1423
04:36:06,500 --> 04:36:09,830
I'm gonna do olive oil. Yeah.

1424
04:36:09,830 --> 04:36:11,830
I'm gonna do an olive oil treatment tonight.

1425
04:36:11,830 --> 04:36:18,810
Yep. I'm gonna do EVOO

1426
04:36:18,810 --> 04:36:20,979
with a little bit of tea tree oil.

1427
04:36:20,979 --> 04:36:23,610
I'm gonna fight this,

1428
04:36:23,610 --> 04:36:25,610
because I've, uh,

1429
04:36:25,610 --> 04:36:29,130
that looks real bad. Oh, man.

1430
04:36:29,130 --> 04:36:34,060
I'm gonna- I'm gonna replace

1431
04:36:34,060 --> 04:36:39,240
the face mask, too. Get a scalp massage.

1432
04:36:39,240 --> 04:36:43,400
Alright, I'll do that.

1433
04:36:43,400 --> 04:36:45,400
Thanks for watching, everybody. Thanks for the subs, too.

1434
04:36:45,400 --> 04:36:49,500
You know, if you're new to the channel, these are the credits

1435
04:36:49,500 --> 04:36:51,799
here. Everybody that's subbed, I do not read

1436
04:36:51,799 --> 04:36:55,000
subs on stream, because I am an

1437
04:36:55,000 --> 04:36:57,000
ungrateful fucking asshole streamer.

1438
04:36:57,000 --> 04:37:03,020
Nah, but seriously, thanks for the subs, everybody.

1439
04:37:03,020 --> 04:37:05,580
Thanks for the bits. Thanks for everything.

1440
04:37:05,580 --> 04:37:07,580
I actually think that- let me see. Take a look.

1441
04:37:07,580 --> 04:37:10,779
Oh, Jesus, we had- speaking of subs.

1442
04:37:10,779 --> 04:37:15,189
Wait, Mr. Sark gave

1443
04:37:15,189 --> 04:37:17,189
twenty community subs earlier?

1444
04:37:17,189 --> 04:37:20,520
No way. I missed that.

1445
04:37:20,520 --> 04:37:22,520
I was too in- into the headset.

1446
04:37:22,520 --> 04:37:27,819
Thanks, Sark, for those twenty subs.

1447
04:37:27,819 --> 04:37:30,439
Appreciate it. Uh, KaiStraw

1448
04:37:30,439 --> 04:37:33,380
thanks for the five community subs.

1449
04:37:33,380 --> 04:37:35,380
Malcolm thanks for the five subs.

1450
04:37:35,380 --> 04:37:37,750
Radshly thanks for the five subs.

1451
04:37:37,750 --> 04:37:39,750
Balls4brains five subs.

1452
04:37:39,750 --> 04:37:41,930
TexanToaster gave sixty

1453
04:37:41,930 --> 04:37:46,279
community subs. Thank you for the

1454
04:37:46,279 --> 04:37:49,419
insane amount of money. That's insane.

1455
04:37:49,419 --> 04:37:54,200
Sixty community subs.

1456
04:37:54,200 --> 04:37:56,200
That's more money than I could ever ask anyone to ever give a stranger

1457
04:37:56,200 --> 04:37:59,400
on the internet. That's a lot of money.

1458
04:37:59,400 --> 04:38:02,599
Thank you. And then InkCat

1459
04:38:02,599 --> 04:38:05,479
with five community subs as well.

1460
04:38:05,479 --> 04:38:13,860
Rounding us out there at the end. You can smell your

1461
04:38:13,860 --> 04:38:16,040
stinky gamer juices.

1462
04:38:16,040 --> 04:38:18,040
What the fuck even is- what's a gamer juice?

1463
04:38:18,040 --> 04:38:21,819
What does a game- what does that mean?

1464
04:38:21,819 --> 04:38:27,380
I really- I- dude, I'm

1465
04:38:27,380 --> 04:38:29,380
losing my mind. I really thought that

1466
04:38:29,380 --> 04:38:31,380
my, like, penis came out on stream today.

1467
04:38:31,380 --> 04:38:39,000
And I, like, freaked out about it.

1468
04:38:39,000 --> 04:38:42,139
That's completely impossible.

1469
04:38:42,139 --> 04:38:48,340
I have no idea why I thought that.

1470
04:38:48,340 --> 04:38:50,340
But it did.

1471
04:38:50,340 --> 04:38:57,819
Uh.

1472
04:38:57,819 --> 04:39:00,500
Uh, let's raid Joel.

1473
04:39:00,500 --> 04:39:02,500
Let's go say hello to Varg Skeletor.

1474
04:39:02,500 --> 04:39:08,330
And I will see you guys tomorrow with Half-Life

1475
04:39:08,330 --> 04:39:10,330
Alex. Okay, if I wake up

1476
04:39:10,330 --> 04:39:12,330
tomorrow and I look in the mirror, and I'm

1477
04:39:12,330 --> 04:39:14,950
just like, this looks horrible.

1478
04:39:14,950 --> 04:39:17,130
What do I do?

1479
04:39:17,130 --> 04:39:19,130
I'm gonna have to, like, put oil on my- I'm gonna have to oil

1480
04:39:19,130 --> 04:39:22,330
my hair back. I think that's what's

1481
04:39:22,330 --> 04:39:24,700
gonna happen. I'm gonna put, like,

1482
04:39:24,700 --> 04:39:26,700
just oil in my hair

1483
04:39:26,700 --> 04:39:28,700
so it slicks all the way back so that it does not touch

1484
04:39:28,700 --> 04:39:30,700
the coconut oil. Yeah.

1485
04:39:30,700 --> 04:39:36,840
Don't use a headband.

1486
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:39,400
A swimming cap. Use olive oil.

1487
04:39:39,400 --> 04:39:41,639
I'm gonna put oil all over

1488
04:39:41,639 --> 04:39:43,639
my head tomorrow. That's the only way this is gonna

1489
04:39:43,639 --> 04:39:52,220
help. Thanks for watching, guys.

1490
04:39:52,220 --> 04:39:54,220
I'll see you soon. See you tomorrow. Take care.

1491
04:39:54,220 --> 04:39:56,220
Good night. And goodbye.
