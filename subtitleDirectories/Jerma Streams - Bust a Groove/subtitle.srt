38
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:44,810

39
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,009
before the beat is over

40
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,689

172
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,500
i first started watching you most people is because of your tf2 memes but for me i wanted

173
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,539
to know how to be a better spy and five years ago when i first found you i was actually taking your

174
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:14,860
gameplay with utmost seriousness at first i didn't bother with your funny vids and i wasn't into the

175
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,170
tuber formula at the time but then i found a video where you showed art and that you were a

176
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:28,579
person the rest is history thanks for keeping me alive thanks a lot glad you could enjoy those

177
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:38,809
old videos and yes those old videos do have some good advice hey everyone's saying dude those old

178
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:42,889
videos gave wicked bad advice you don't actually want to play that was back before anybody was

179
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:51,960
given advice it's like if you if what if i'm the if you if i'm the only doctor in town you're

180
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:02,170
coming to me there are no other doctors you're coming to me and then eventually like other

181
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,769
doctors put up shop and are way better of a doctor than i am but i mean i gave some decent doctor

182
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:17,989
advice for how to play tf2 and then that doctor uh realizes that other doctors in the area can

183
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:25,559
perform the surgery better than he can so he goes into stand-up comedy and he remembers all the

184
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:37,110
times that he told the jokes to his patients and they laughed and then he took out the wrong organ

185
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:42,309
and then he became a fucking famous stand-up comedian doctor who's not a doctor anybody

186
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:46,309
didn't need to be a doctor he didn't even need to be a doctor anymore you can just be a comedian

187

247
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,099
be very upfront with this i mean this is not me don't take this anyway besides the way i'm

248
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:29,480
saying it exactly if i am not interested i'm not gonna do it as net stark once said

249
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:37,820
if i cannot stay interested and stay engaged and and want to continue to try to do new things and

250
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:43,340
try to make this drive it has to interest me i'm not gonna turn this stream on just because

251
00:58:44,219 --> 00:59:01,340
i need to or have to in quotes right that's not gonna happen he's a diva so i don't want to do

252
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:09,699
that i'd rather it be something that i like to actually do and i mean i'm doing this for 10 years

253
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:15,699
coming up next year is 10 years i don't know it might i might start to want to try something new

00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:26,579
20 10 20 13 years i'm probably i if i'm still interested let's go but when i'm not i'm gonna

255
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:43,639
move on that's just the way it is this is the only way don't give him money so he has to keep

256
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:50,599
streaming no money has nothing to do with if i'm gonna keep streaming if i okay i could get i could

257
