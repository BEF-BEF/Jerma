1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:12,380
Hey there, hi. How's it going? People watching the Vaught have no idea about what. I wasn't late,

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:28,390
I was there exactly at 3.59 p.m. Yeah, I was just talking to Mr. Italics. He expressed interest

3
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,890
in hopping in a little later. He's like, yeah, I kind of want to play. So I was like, yeah,

4
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:47,659
whatever. So we might see him in an hour or two. Maybe sooner, we'll see. Tell him you don't

5
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:57,049
want it. That's like so rude. Why would I do that? Hey man, yeah, like it's a game that has

6
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:04,060
multiplayer and stuff. Like, yeah, I'll play with you. No, I don't want you. That's like, why?

7
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:11,530
It's like a co-op game, isn't it? What are you fucking talking about? Anywho,

8
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,650
hi guys. Yeah, here's the plan. We're gonna do Mordhau. I hope I'm saying that right.

9
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:23,349
Probably not, but you know, one guy said that. You must be new here.

10
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:34,409
5,000 of you could write the same sentence and I wouldn't see it. They would be one person

11
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,569
in between that 5,000 sentences of the same sentence and I would read that one out loud.

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,239
It's like my brain finds patterns and then the ghost for the thing that's not the pattern.

13
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:57,349
I'm always connecting patterns with words and language. So, but yeah, we're gonna do Mordhau

14
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:03,109
tonight. I don't know how long we'll do this for. Who knows? I might get addicted to this game and

15
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:08,729
it might be the only thing I play. You know, I think I'm gonna get so good at this game. I'm

16
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,050
gonna play it so much. I'm gonna make a movie. I'm gonna make a game. I'm gonna make a horror

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,860
game in Mordhau too. I'm gonna spend all night playing Mordhau and like that's all

18
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,860
I'm gonna do. And then tomorrow you'll see some more Mordhau of me of what I've been

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:31,659
able to come up with. But no, it's that Dreams is a lot deeper of a game. I want to spend more time

20
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:37,909
with it. So what we're gonna do with Dreams is we're gonna spend... That's a new lie.

21
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:43,370
No, it's not a new lie. It was never a lie in the first place. Did you look at the tutorials

22
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,020
for Dreams? Yes. I did look at them. I looked at them. There's quite a few of them. I looked

23
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,340
at them. I mean, I didn't do any of them. I looked at them though and I looked at them.

24
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:02,710
Now we got a tutorial. Speaking of tutorials, we've got one to do here. So we might as well

25
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:10,229
hurry this up. So let's go ahead and get that off. I don't have the camera on right now.

26
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:18,789
Hey, look at that. This is Mordhau. It is a first person medieval multiplayer action

27
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:27,020
attack each other game. Looks like fun. A lot of people were requesting this yesterday,

28
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,210
so I figured I'd give it a try. And let me make sure the audio is okay. Make sure

29
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,819
it's not too loud. It is probably way too loud. You're gonna have to tell me. You're

30
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:50,500
gonna have to yell at me. It's probably a little bit better. That's okay. So I have no

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,219
idea how this works. We get 2,500 bucks when we complete it. So let's play it.

32
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:08,659
Go. Takes approximately 15 minutes. Now that's the kind of tutorial I like. Only 15 minutes.

33
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:16,100
Hold on. I gotta fucking stall for a second so I can tweet it. I do this thing where I

34
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,899
make a tweet before and then I accidentally just cancel the tweet and then have to redo it.

35
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:31,459
What I'm saying is, I'm just fucking not intelligent. It's all been a lie. I had two

36
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:38,949
IQ tests. Yes, I did. It was very bad. And I just tell everybody on the internet that I'm

37
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:51,860
smart so people think that I'm smart. Don't you understand? Oh, okay. Mordhau. Landlord?

38
00:04:52,579 --> 00:05:02,459
No, lardlord. I should just change it to landlord. Why is it lardlord?

39
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:15,480
Twitch.tv. Why is this pre-recorded? I don't understand. How can you guys

40
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,740
determine that? What makes something pre-recorded? What is it? What does it take?

41
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,430
Is this the way I'm talking? Like, okay, so let me type this in.

42
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,540
Is it? Press end for a new beginning.

43
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm fucking huge.

44
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,790
Go on. Look around. This is the place where I'll teach you how to fight without stopping

45
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,750
yourself in the process. P is first person. Okay, hold on. This is sensitivity. It's way

46
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,149
too high. All right. That's quite enough sightseeing for now. Eyes on me, you two.

47
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,750
Mouse x-axis? Oh, should I hate when they do this?

48
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,379
I can never get this right. I always accidentally make it like two points higher.

49
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,850
It's gotta be lower than that. All the pros told me.

50
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:14,899
Point fifty point fifty. Right? That's better.

51
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,339
Might need maybe a little bit higher. Okay, go back. Go back to first person.

52
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,060
This is a real battlefield, but don't be alarmed. We're perfectly safe at the moment.

53
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,240
That seems to happen quite frequently.

54
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,199
Where's your sword, recruit?

55
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,839
Where's your sword? Sword!

56
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,040
Get down to it. Hit dummy three times.

57
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,860
Dummy. That's not the dummy. The dummy's behind me.

58
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,540
Left mouse button to perform an attack. Here's the... oh, look at that. That's the direction

59
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:57,939
that you go. So you come from each angle.

60
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,540
Press the left mouse button to perform an attack. While that attack is halfway through,

61
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,779
press the left mouse button again to execute another follow-up attack.

62
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,250
Easy enough.

63
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,939
All right, he's fine.

64
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,939
Holy shit. I fucking slit his throat like five times.

65
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,139
Oh, what a classic Jerva joke!

66
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,269
Again, one more. I played enough Sekiro to know how to do this.

67
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:00,759
Good. If you quickly toime your attacks after a parry, you will perform a repost.

68
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,040
A quick follow-up attack that will catch your opponents by surprise.

69
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,399
Toimen is crucial. Toimen.

70
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,120
You must perform the attack slightly before or exactly at the time of the block.

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Parry my attack. Right before. Okay.

72
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,040
Here we go. Excellent repost.

73
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,120
Jesus. One more thing about parrying it.

74
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,040
It only lasts a short while. The way you turn your hips can make your weapon hit sooner or later.

75
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,480
This can be used to create an effect and throw off your opponent's toimen.

76
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,759
Try to block three of my strikes as I turn in and out of them.

77
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,759
Okay. Good.

78
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,809
One more. You're only coming from one direction.

79
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,529
Make sure you have the stamina to perform a parry.

80
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,610
Otherwise, you might end up losing your weapon.

81
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,490
Oh, stamina.

82
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,330
Parry my next attack.

83
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,940
Ha! Like stealing candy from a baby.

84
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,740
He just took my...

85
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,419
I'm not your butler.

86
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,820
Oh, we're getting a classic fucking Jerva YouTube joke.

87
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,019
So that's E. If you have no...

88
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,139
Pick it up. If you have no inventory space, press G to drop what you're carrying.

89
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,460
Let's see if you can do more than just mindlessly quail around with that weapon.

90
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,340
We will start with a simple horizontal strike.

91
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,419
I see.

92
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,139
Chop that stick up with three horizontal slashes.

93
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
Okay.

94
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,100
Move your mouse slightly to the left or right and press left mouse button to execute a horizontal attack.

95
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,340
Yeah.

96
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,899
Good.

97
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,429
So you kind of just...

98
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,149
Like that.

99
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:30,549
I see.

100
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,500
One more.

101
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,460
Does it matter if I take the thing off?

102
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,929
Is there a way I can make that slower?

103
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,649
I feel like it's really erratic.

104
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,730
It's like holding a compass and spinning around in a circle.

105
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,700
Move your mouse slightly upwards and...

106
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,100
Upwards.

107
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,580
See what I mean?

108
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,980
It's like...

109
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,860
Yeah!

110
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,470
I feel like someone's holding a magnet up to my fucking compass.

111
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,789
All right.

112
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,019
So anyway, where's the pumpkin again?

113
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,019
Good job.

114
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,179
Next we have the stab, which is an attack that allows you for precise hits.

115
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,779
Stab that cabbage over there.

116
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,059
See what I mean?

117
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:08,460
It's kind of...

118
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,269
Stab.

119
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,230
Mouse wheel up.

120
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,220
Interesting.

121
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,379
Nice farming, recruit.

122
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,820
Almost missed the pumpkin.

123
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
Most weapons have an alternate mode of use.

124
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,139
What's that show where they cut shit?

125
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,659
They make the sword and then they have to cut a bunch of stuff and run around and

126
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,299
get winded hitting like meat and chickens and stuff?

127
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,899
No, not Fruit Ninja.

128
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,259
It's an actual show on TV.

129
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,909
Okay, so R to switch weapon mode.

130
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,710
Why the hell would I hold it like this?

131
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:49,110
Hit the dummy on the helmet.

132
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,230
Why?

133
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,470
You're not supposed to hold a sword like this.

134
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,830
Kicks cannot be blocked by a parry.

135
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,429
Kicks can't be blocked, right?

136
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,549
That makes sense.

137
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:05,429
Forged in fire.

138
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:05,909
That's the one.

139
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,309
You can defend yourself against kicks by performing a kick yourself.

140
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,909
So you can block a kick with a kick.

141
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,830
Kicks by kicking right before I hit you.

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,519
Good block.

143
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,000
Another.

144
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,519
I want to rebind that.

145
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,559
All right, all right.

146
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:19,799
Okay.

147
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,159
I don't want that as F.

148
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,559
Sometimes it's a good idea to cancel an attack before it is fully committed.

149
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,879
This can trick your opponents into firing early.

150
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,600
I can't pause it.

151
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,399
Can only cancel an attack before it is fully committed.

152
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,000
So don't wait too long.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,759
Get around my defense three times by tricking me into parrying it.

154
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,720
Left mouse button to start and then just after press Q to faint.

155
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,159
All right, okay.

156
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,440
Press 9 to skip this tutorial stage.

157
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,139
All right, I get a follow up but it's okay.

158
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,220
Well played.

159
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,500
Snakey.

160
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,179
Snakey.

161
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:58,940
Well done.

162
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,620
This kind of reminds me of if For Honor was cool.

163
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,220
Form an attack morph.

164
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,700
Or cooler.

165
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,059
Only morph from strike to stab or vice versa.

166
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:12,779
To perform a morph, start an attack and then start another attack shortly after.

167
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,580
Morph an attack.

168
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,059
This will morph the original attack into the new one and throw off your opponent's sense of toying.

169
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,500
Get around my defense three times by tricking me with a morph.

170
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,580
Okay, you can morph from strike to stab.

171
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,019
So stab just press left mouse button before strike and then quickly mouse wheel up.

172
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,019
Well played.

173
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:29,820
Okay.

174
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,259
So you can do the same thing in reverse.

175
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,029
Snakey.

176
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:33,529
Yeah.

177
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,850
That's enough.

178
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,409
Cool.

179
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,289
You can go back and forth.

180
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:41,769
I'll show you an advanced maneuver called chambering next.

181
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,929
Instead of parrying, you can mirror my attacks with your own attack.

182
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,570
If you do this just before the attack hits you,

183
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,610
it'll act as both as a block and a counter attack.

184
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,610
All right, we'll do it in the same direction.

185
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,289
You must learn to successfully chamber.

186
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:58,009
I will perform a left horizontal slash,

187
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:03,129
which you must counter by performing a right horizontal slash just before I hit you.

188
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:03,769
Get ready.

189
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,450
Okay, right horizontal right.

190
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:07,690
Well, I didn't do it right.

191
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:10,629
Got to be quick.

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,059
Wait, what?

193
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,230
Wait, hold on.

194
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,629
Wait, wait, wait.

195
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:23,990
Perform a right slash right before the weapon reaches you.

196
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,809
Oh, okay.

197
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:33,370
I get it.

198
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,049
I thought I was going to like Darth Vader.

199
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,899
I thought it was going to be going to do the lightsaber connect thing.

200
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,419
It's right when you get hit.

201
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,019
It's literally right before it touches you.

202
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,830
All right, let's see.

203
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,269
Now apply all that you have learned and land five strikes on me.

204
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,110
For this time, I won't hold back.

205
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,059
Come here.

206
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:17,700
Good, again.

207
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:25,460
God damn, this is fucking crazy.

208
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,039
So there's only, you can only parry for a second.

209
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:40,460
Uh-oh, died to the instructor.

210
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,899
Uh-oh, died to the instructor.

211
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,429
One more, not much worth it for the fight.

212
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,429
Hey squirts, thanks for the five community subs.

213
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,139
It's time to play with some new toys.

214
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,179
Hold G to guard.

215
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:08,980
Oh, isn't that funny?

216
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,500
You ain't going to get me on that one.

217
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,340
You know, I could, I might be dense, but I'm not thick.

219
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,549
I have a really heavy brain, not a thick brain.

220
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,299
All right, so pick up a bow.

221
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,139
You kind of have to get out of the way.

222
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,950
You asshole.

223
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,990
Supposed to be the instructor.

224
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,710
Get out of my way.

225
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,659
All right, let's get the bow.

226
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:39,860
And there it is.

227
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,820
There's my bread and butter.

228
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,669
Oh, bread and butter.

229
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,230
He said bread and butter.

230
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,190
He says that all the time.

231
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
What's the drop like?

232
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,990
Outer circle.

233
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,009
It's not bad.

234
00:15:58,789 --> 00:15:59,590
Outer circle.

235
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,990
Let's see, how high?

236
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,950
Outer circle.

237
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,470
No, is there, is there any drop?

238
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,049
Oh well, you're not blind after all.

239
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,809
I want some real shots now.

240
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,129
Hit that medium range target three times.

241
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,570
First of all, left mouse button, start drawing the bow,

242
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,450
and release when ready to fire.

243
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,330
If you run out of ammo, you can restock from the ammo box to your left.

244
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,830
Cool.

245
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,620
Far outer circle.

246
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,659
Far outer circle, okay.

247
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,809
Far outer circle.

248
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,250
No, so it is a little higher than that.

249
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,049
Let's see.

250
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:31,769
Like up here?

251
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,210
Inner circle.

252
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,929
There it is, yeah.

253
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,289
It's not, it's really not that much.

254
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,090
Want to prove me wrong?

255
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,009
Three hits on the far target.

256
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:40,570
Oh, fuck.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,399
Ah, too bad.

258
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:53,769
Far outer circle.

259
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:59,820
Ah, no, it's a little bit lower.

260
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,580
It drops right at the end.

261
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,390
Far outer circle.

262
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,509
No, give me an inner circle.

263
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,019
Far outer circle.

264
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,059
No, fuck you.

265
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,779
Okay, okay, I'll admit, you're a natural.

266
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:19,779
However, what separates a true marksman from a talented amateur is the Hanz test.

267
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,940
What separates a true amateur, as you've been able to tell,

268
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,539
I have a really dense brain.

269
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,930
No arrow, what?

270
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,369
I have to shoot this guy?

271
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,890
Is this the guy screaming running around a field?

272
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,279
This guy's harder than an actual video game.

273
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,960
He's like the ducks.

274
00:17:47,960 --> 00:18:00,200
I'll get him right here.

275
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,279
This is actually really hard to hit somebody.

276
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,579
Splendid shot.

277
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:05,220
Don't worry.

278
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,440
He's at wars.

279
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,160
Follow me.

280
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
I have a surprise for you.

281
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,730
A surprise?

282
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,150
Hopefully, you're not afraid of horses.

283
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,269
Pick up that lance.

284
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,910
How much is there to do in this game?

285
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:27,190
The lance is useless on foot, but it is devastating on horseback.

286
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,470
Now hop onto the horse.

287
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,710
Jesus.

288
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,170
Press F while riding fast to start.

289
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,609
All right, we got to get F out of here.

290
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,630
Yeah, we got to get F the hell out of here.

291
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,950
Hold on.

292
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,779
I got to change that to a mouse button.

293
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:48,779
Key bindings.

294
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:51,940
What's F?

296
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,740
Kick?

297
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,980
I want this to be this button.

298
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,700
Yeah, whatever.

299
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
Upper right strike, lower right strike.

300
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,619
I think, do I need to know?

301
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:01,740
Do we need to have this shit?

302
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:11,339
All right, press thumb mouse button while riding fast to start a crouched attack.

303
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,730
Okay.

304
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,200
Hit the dummies.

305
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
Oh, I have to hit the dummies.

306
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:27,559
So do I have to hold it or just press it?

307
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,049
Probably have to hold it.

308
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,339
Uh, what?

309
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,160
Just get me off the horse.

310
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,119
I'll never be on it.

311
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,160
I'm never going to use the horse.

312
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,819
Uh, so you just have to be...

313
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:58,859
How fast do you have to be going?

314
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,380
I have to hold it.

315
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,019
I'm holding it.

316
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:04,980
Okay, I'm holding it now.

317
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,950
You know, okay, it'll only last for a certain amount of time.

318
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:12,779
Now you actually have to pull the...

319
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,569
Your hand out like this.

320
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,900
You don't just have to aim down.

321
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
You have to like pull...

322
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,900
Or don't fall off the horse.

323
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,779
This isn't red dead.

324
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,380
I got to turn around.

325
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,059
I wish I had a more open field for this.

326
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,299
They're kind of like sticky in the middle of here.

327
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:37,210
It's hard to control this too.

328
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:50,150
What?

329
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,470
Why?

330
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,269
How is that missing?

331
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:53,509
What?

332
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,210
Oh, get me off this thing.

333
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:11,579
Quit horsing around.

334
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,140
That was funny.

335
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,859
Come on.

336
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,500
Give him that one.

337
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,190
Just don't do that in the game.

338
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,960
I'm not gonna because I'm not going to be a horseback person.

339
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,579
I'm going to be a assassin.

340
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,539
That's my character.

341
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,150
And I'm going to roleplay on Mike the whole time.

342
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,470
I mean, what I meant to say is I'm going to be axe guy.

343
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:47,609
Axe guy doesn't go on a horse.

344
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,049
He runs.

345
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,750
That guy doesn't get on the back of the horse.

346
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:08,599
Hey!

347
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
What the fuck is that for?

348
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,339
All right, I'm going to be meat tenderizer guy.

349
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,910
So I have to repair both doors?

350
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:27,180
Well, that seems fairly...

351
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,099
This probably costs money.

352
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:47,769
Longsword.

353
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,930
Oh, a trebuchet.

354
00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:09,210
How are you...

355
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,289
Mouse wheel down, mouse wheel up to increase the disc...

356
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,529
Okay, to increase and decrease the power of the shot.

357
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,779
This is just golf all over again.

358
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm not going to play this either.

359
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,339
I'm not going to touch this because this is golf.

360
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,420
And you see how bad I was at golf.

361
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,470
I got it.

362
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,390
Okay.

363
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,269
Take out the middle one.

364
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:52,549
Increase the middle one.

365
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:53,190
That one there.

366
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,279
That's way too far.

367
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:01,829
Damn it.

368
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,450
Do you want to point blank him in the face with this, can I?

369
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,069
No, you can't.

370
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,170
What if I just...

371
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,450
Okay, what if I just go closer?

372
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:19,509
Hold on.

373
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:24,410
Can I just seriously disintegrate his head?

374
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,500
No, that's not going to work.

375
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,220
Just fuck that.

376
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,099
I'm just going to go down here.

377
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:42,859
Oh, god damn it.

378
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:43,740
I just ruined everything.

379
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm stuck and he's actually in the way.

380
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:52,410
Just back it up.

381
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,369
I can't move this now.

382
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,700
There we go.

383
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,420
Okay, all right, all right.

384
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,380
Easy, easy, easy.

385
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,970
All right, turn.

386
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,049
Right there is fine.

387
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:16,839
How are you supposed to hit this shit?

388
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:27,910
I was going to say, if that wasn't it.

389
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,869
Oh, god damn it.

390
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,680
First try, get it.

391
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah!

392
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,920
Wait, let's throw one more rocket.

393
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,000
All right, so everyone that was asking, well, what the hell happened to Sam and Max

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,279
and what happened to Dreams?

395
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,079
Dreams is not something I can...

396
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,119
Okay, here we go.

397
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,240
Quote, start now.

398
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,920
Dreams is not something that I can make something worth doing

399
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,480
and worth streaming in one day.

400
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,920
I need to go through all the tutorials

401
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,160
and really get the knowledge of the program

402
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,119
and make something more than one thing

403
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,279
over the course of the next four or five days.

404
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,880
Now, what does that mean for you?

405
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,799
I'm going to hold a community event, maybe a week from now,

406
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,240
where we can...

407
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Whoever has Dreams can make something with the hashtag Jerma

408
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,759
or Jerma in the title and we will watch it all

409
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,480
and play through them all in a week.

410
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,690
That's what's going to happen with Dreams

411
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,829
and I will be contributing as well.

412
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:46,789
That's what happened to Dreams.

413
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:48,150
That's why it's not here right now.

414
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:54,259
A week isn't enough time.

415
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
Well, then two weeks, I don't know.

416
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:06,059
We'll figure it out.

417
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,420
Why does this take so long?

418
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,019
So there's a Battle Royale mode, from my understanding.

419
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,000
Isn't enough people willing to learn Dreams.

420
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,799
It's hard.

421
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,630
Wait, didn't I just do this?

422
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:28,200
Where's my money?

423
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,890
Hey, what?

424
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,859
Why do I have zero dollars?

425
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,420
Okay, Battle Royale.

426
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,900
What should I do?

427
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,779
Battle VR?

428
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,880
Europe?

429
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,930
Oh, it's West.

430
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,799
Horde mode, frontline Battle Royale.

431
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:00,680
This is the first time...

432
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,720
Okay, let me tell you something.

433
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,039
This is the first time I have ever played a Battle Royale game.

434
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,240
On this stream, besides PUBG, like once.

435
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:16,059
Okay, let's go for it.

436
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,019
Do you drop?

437
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,980
Do we fly in a giant taxi cab and have it drop us?

438
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:27,240
How do we land?

439
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,400
I don't understand.

440
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,450
Do we have to pick up items?

441
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,369
I'm so confused at how this is going to work.

442
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,700
Yes, a medieval plane drops you off.

443
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,069
Yeah, I mean, this is a long time ago.

444
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:03,990
It's probably one of those little sea planes.

445
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:11,140
That dragon?

446
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,859
Now that would be cool.

447
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,970
30 damage.

448
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,119
Oh, right in the face.

449
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,160
That did extra damage.

450
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,460
Got him.

451
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,660
See you later.

452
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:38,500
I feel like I'm going to like this Battle Royale because it's not...

453
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,190
You can't camp with, like, a sniper rifle on the roof.

454
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:54,039
You have to go beat the shit out of each other.

455
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,960
Oh, that would hurt so bad.

456
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,930
We're just punching a haymaker into stone.

457
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:04,170
What is going on?

458
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,750
They got DC?

459
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,269
Did I DC?

460
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:17,059
What the fuck?

461
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,099
This is going to be fun.

462
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,220
Come on.

463
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,430
Get me in there.

464
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:34,710
It's the server?

465
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,710
Should I join, like, a different server?

466
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,750
Should I join, like, US East or something?

467
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,299
Come on, get me in there.

468
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,799
I feel like I'd be very good at this.

469
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,500
You know what I'm saying?

470
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,859
I'll try this one more time.

471
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,539
I could burger boy technique at least half the people that play this game.

472
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,920
This used to be a variety stream.

473
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,480
Now you play Battle Royale like everybody else.

474
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,720
The matchmaking is all fucked up right now.

475
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,519
Okay, well, hold on.

476
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,349
The boomer technique?

477
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:33,099
Yeah, VR normie boomer streamer.

478
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,680
It's like, look, look.

479
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,130
The boomer technique is real.

480
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,369
You have to press the buttons as many of them as you can at the same time.

481
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,710
So you'll go to, you'll fight somebody in the arcade.

482
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,109
And you'll make them cry because you...

483
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:59,750
Well, I mean, like Mortal Kombat, like arcade cabinet.

484
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,750
What I used to do when I was a kid is they would be these dudes that were older.

485
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,910
They were like 10 years older than me, right?

486
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,140
And this is back when arcade machines had the good console games

487
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,140
because console games weren't good enough back then, right?

488
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,579
So Mortal Kombat 3 was in the arcade.

489
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:16,700
And what I would do is I would go there.

490
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,660
I was probably like 15 or no, I was like 12.

491
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,299
What am I talking about?

492
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,299
I was playing Mortal Kombat when I was like 12 in the arcade.

493
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,740
They didn't like, nobody cared if you did that.

494
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,059
So anyways, playing Mortal Kombat when I was 12 versus like a 19-year-old.

495
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:30,619
You know what I mean?

496
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,099
And you had the face buttons.

497
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,940
You had like six of them and you had the joystick.

498
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,180
And it was a thing back then where people would line up behind

499
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:41,859
whoever was playing and it would be like,

500
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,299
okay, when you lose, yeah, now it's my turn to try and take on the champion.

501
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,180
Because if you won, you didn't have to put my money in.

502
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,819
You got to stay.

503
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,519
So what would happen is I would get up there and go up again.

504
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,000
I would pick smoke every time in Mortal Kombat 3.

505
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,259
Cyborg Smoke was the best character ever.

506
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,940
And then this guy would crack his knuckles like,

507
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,859
yeah, this little kid's got nothing on me.

508
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:04,740
I've been practicing.

509
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,619
I got my own kit.

510
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,140
He'd get up and he would be doing his little button combos and shit.

511
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,339
And I would be going like this.

512
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,259
Just pressing every single button I could, mashing as hard as I could.

513
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,700
And I beat them all.

514
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,339
The guy would get fucking flawless half the time.

515
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:23,140
Am I supposed to be playing?

516
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
Next in line, please.

517
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:48,809
How does this work?

518
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:56,839
So there's 17 people left.

519
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,839
You want to fight the fucking 12-year-old?

520
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,589
That's a real fancy fucking kit you got there.

521
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,750
Too bad you didn't think you were going up against smoke.

522
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,349
He's trying to pick up items.

523
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,150
Oh shit, he's got, what does he got, a leg?

524
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,269
He doesn't even know.

525
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,389
Well, this guy's good.

526
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,199
Uh-oh, it's Kabal.

527
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,679
I'm standing in the fucking fire.

528
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,650
Why can I, why are we all so dumb?

529
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,780
Oh, I got to write the teeth.

530
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,530
Oh, you didn't think I was going to come at you like that, did you?

531
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,329
Oh, give me that.

532
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,050
What's that?

533
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,230
Give me his helmet, too.

534
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:25,449
Oh shit.

535
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,570
I'm going to get the presents.

536
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:30,969
Hold on.

537
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:31,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

538
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,650
There's a lot of stuff on the ground.

539
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,329
How do I go in my inventory?

540
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,460
I don't know how to go in my inventory.

541
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,619
Long sword, rusty shovel.

542
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,219
No, I don't want to use the rusty shovel.

543
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,900
Maybe I do.

544
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,369
What else do I have?

545
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,219
Okay, here's the poleaxe.

546
00:35:52,219 --> 00:36:02,300
This is too nerve wracking.

547
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,900
How big is the area?

548
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,230
There's the guy right there.

549
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,750
I'm going to shovel the fuck out of this guy.

550
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,949
I just broke all my legs.

551
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:14,489
Is there a heal?

552
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:15,530
Am I healing over time?

553
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,170
I don't understand.

554
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,579
Oh my god, I'm going to shovel this guy.

555
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:30,070
What's that?

556
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,030
What's that?

557
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:40,809
Just kidding.

558
00:36:52,039 --> 00:37:00,679
Oh, where's it going?

559
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,940
Someone's going to come from behind me.

560
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,260
I know it.

561
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,059
Eat berries?

562
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,699
Is that what you do?

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Oh shit, I almost had it.

564
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,199
I don't know what to do.

565
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,039
How do I heal?

566
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,179
Give me the poleaxe.

567
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:38,820
What's this?

568
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,099
What the, what the, whoa, whoa, whoa.

569
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,780
What, what, what, what, what?

570
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,420
What is that?

571
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,780
What did I die instantly for?

572
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,099
What?

573
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,420
Was that out of bounds?

574
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,659
What?

575
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,699
That's the circle?

576
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,219
Oh, there's a circle.

577
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,260
I thought it ticked damage on you.

578
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,530
Guys, I don't play Battle Royales.

579
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,690
I've played a Battle Royale like twice.

580
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,840
Oh, I can't believe he's not one of these streamers

581
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,679
that plays Battle Royale every day.

582
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,630
What?

583
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,269
I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle.

584
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:22,710
I mean, this guy streams Battle Royales 5,000 hours.

585
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,989
I can't believe you didn't know.

586
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:25,429
I didn't know.

587
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,059
It was just gray.

588
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,139
I thought it was like going to battlefield me

589
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:38,099
and turn me around.

590
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:40,070
You know what it goes like?

591
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:43,269
Please get back to the playing field in five seconds.

592
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,670
Hey, it's Alex.

593
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,789
I did really well.

594
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,920
I was killing people.

595
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,599
I just fucking walked out of the circle

596
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,719
and died instantly.

597
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,929
I'm calling him.

598
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:04,980
He needs to know.

599
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:15,769
I'm calling him right now.

600
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:22,780
Hey, the Battle Royale circle thing instantly killed me.

601
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,820
I was doing well.

602
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,780
I was in the last six.

603
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,260
Did you get like chased and you got caught in the circle?

604
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,260
I cowered it out and I ran away.

605
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,179
But then like I stepped out of the circle for a second.

606
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,940
It was just like somebody hit me in the head with a rock

607
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,380
and I instantly died.

608
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,190
I don't play Battle Royales.

609
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:42,860
Hold on.

610
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,139
So you like you strolled casually into the fog?

611
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:46,699
Is that what happened?

612
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,940
And instantly died?

613
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,219
I was doing so good too.

614
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:50,619
All right.

615
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,340
How do I add you?

616
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,019
We're going to do that.

617
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,619
Can you queue as two for Battle Royale?

618
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,619
There's a party system.

619
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,420
Let's see.

620
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,789
Oops.

621
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:05,670
Party.

622
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,909
Home.

623
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,309
Am I logged in?

624
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,789
Probably not.

625
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,619
Maybe I can see you.

626
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:12,420
Are you like in the game?

627
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:13,539
Oh, there we go.

628
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:14,739
I think I can just add you.

629
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,039
What's your name?

630
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,809
Stixon.

631
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,250
Stixon.

632
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:23,429
All right.

633
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:24,230
There you go.

634
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,269
Did you get it?

635
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,380
You should have got it, right?

636
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:33,190
Yes.

637
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,170
But I don't see you in the party list here.

638
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,449
Yeah, it just it said I got an invite

639
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,929
but there's not actually like an accept invitation button.

640
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,269
Can you join off me?

641
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:50,650
It doesn't even say that you're playing Mordhau.

642
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:52,599
What?

643
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:52,920
What?

644
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,059
Can I join you?

645
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,760
When's this game coming out to the Epic Game Store?

646
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,719
Just wondering.

647
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,360
What?

648
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,599
What?

649
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,730
Oh, hold on.

650
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,929
Can I leave party now?

651
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:08,489
I don't think I can.

652
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,179
Yeah, I'm online.

653
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,380
I'm appearing online.

654
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,780
Should be.

655
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,889
Invites do not work.

656
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:21,130
Oh.

657
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,250
Well.

658
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,409
Invites don't work.

659
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,690
So like if I invite you, what does it say?

660
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,369
It says you invited me to play a hit play game

661
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,889
and I can't join you.

662
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,650
I just probably pressed it.

663
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,050
So, so we can't play together.

664
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,929
Is that what you guys are saying?

665
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,179
We have to find a server browser and join the same server.

666
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, that's that.

667
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,860
That's minus a full etiquette.

668
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,820
I think we're on the bad.

669
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:52,250
Okay, but that means that people can like come get us.

670
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,889
Isn't it?

671
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:55,449
Because they'll know what server we're in.

672
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,210
Isn't that like, isn't that the streamer thing?

673
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,489
We put on like a three minute delay and put a fake name on.

674
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,429
Hold on.

675
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,150
Server browser.

676
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,699
Rent a server is down here.

677
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:12,340
All right.

678
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,460
Server browser.

679
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,820
Are you getting anything in the server browser?

680
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
I'm not getting anything in the server browser.

681
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,969
The rent a server button works.

682
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:29,369
One availed by a server.

683
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:32,500
Okay.

684
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,909
How do we not full has players and no password?

685
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:41,269
They're official servers yet?

686
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,900
Game mode.

687
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,360
We should probably just do death match, right?

688
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:57,380
Yeah.

689
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,019
I hit refresh.

690
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:58,500
Let's see.

691
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,699
There you guys can see.

692
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,780
See, I'm kind of just sitting here.

693
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,420
Oh, there we go.

694
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:04,380
All right.

695
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,260
Real questions.

696
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,300
Is this game early access?

697
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,340
Uh, I don't, I don't know.

698
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:15,940
Is it, uh, there's his official death match.

699
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,340
Los Angeles with only one slot though.

700
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:26,260
Uh, all right.

701
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
So these, these mean that they're official servers.

702
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,789
All right.

703
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:31,429
I'm going to, okay.

704
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,190
I'm going to, I'm going to mute everything.

705
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,829
And I'm going to tell you the server.

706
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,510
Server browser works now.

707
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,190
Yeah, I can see it now.

708
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,869
Well, it don't, it don't even matter.

709
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,469
It doesn't matter what server people know we're going.

710
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,309
Cause there's only 16 people allowed anyways.

711
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,630
There's only like five that we're going to be able to choose from in the first place.

712
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:51,059
All right.

713
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:53,699
So we're going to whatever.

714
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,320
I don't matter.

715
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
We're going to sort by name.

716
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,519
We're going to.

717
00:43:58,519 --> 00:43:58,840
Yeah.

718
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,019
So if I ping, I can't click any of the sort buttons.

719
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:04,260
No.

720
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:12,630
Uh, well let's just, well, it was fun playing with you.

721
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:14,869
That was really good coffee experience.

722
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,710
Glad you like asked me to play the Charlie.

723
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,269
Let's go.

724
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:21,050
Uh, there's, did you see this one?

725
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:25,130
Do you see the official U S West number eight?

726
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,250
I mean, there's nobody in there though.

727
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:28,869
There will be.

728
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:29,349
There's okay.

729
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:30,070
Official Dallas.

730
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,429
I'm going to find it before I can.

731
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:32,710
Do you see Dallas?

732
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,920
Official death match, Dallas.

733
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,309
There should be spots in there.

734
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:45,429
We don't have the greatest ping, but you know.

735
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:48,309
Well, what's the, what's the ping?

736
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:53,960
It's like a hundred.

737
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,920
Official team death match, Dallas or official death match.

738
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:02,969
Dallas is going to be full.

739
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,690
No, nobody's playing right now.

740
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:14,170
All right.

741
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,250
I'm going to give this like 30 more seconds

742
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,690
and then I'm just going to join a random server.

743
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,070
Yeah, that was, that was open.

744
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,639
Is it official death match?

745
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,199
Dallas.

746
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:29,099
Does Spina for it's like the high row can quick up.

747
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,769
I'm not going to be able to find it.

748
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,070
Uh, so all right.

749
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,030
There's no way to.

750
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,190
All right.

751
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,510
Wait, wait.

752
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,750
Okay.

753
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,829
We're, we're on the same internet.

754
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:38,949
So we have the same thing.

755
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:40,710
Tell me an exact ping for something.

756
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,590
And I joined.

757
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:51,880
Do you see the one with, uh, 65 ping Los Angeles.

758
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,519
Official death math.

759
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,800
Watch inches Phoebe five.

760
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:04,099
Okay.

761
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,340
Uh, 65 Phoebe.

762
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,260
See which, which one Los Angeles Phoebe.

763
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,309
I see Los Angeles, the mirror, Los Angeles, the Lhasa.

764
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:20,809
All right.

765
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,010
Well, I'm just going to, I'm going to play.

766
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:24,489
Yeah, I don't blame you.

767
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,530
It's not, uh, anyone's fault except the game

768
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,969
that the matchmaking doesn't work.

769
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:32,969
How do we not see the same one?

770
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:34,250
How do we not see the same one?

771
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,960
It's what's with this video game, the Lhasa.

772
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,380
Did you see Dallas Lhasa?

773
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,500
Go click it quick.

774
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,250
No, it's full.

775
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,889
It had like a few spots.

776
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,119
All right.

777
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,679
We'll just, um, I'm going to mute everything

778
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,719
and we're just going to talk.

779
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:00,039
Ready?

780
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:04,059
Oh, let me view you here.

781
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:04,539
All right.

782
00:47:04,539 --> 00:48:35,989
Well, we're going to get this figured out.

783
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:36,309
All right.

784
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,630
I know.

785
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,989
Like, uh, I couldn't get like the surfer browser to come back.

786
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:48,340
So we're kind of just, we're just going to queue up the server browser.

787
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,300
Like wouldn't come back.

788
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,670
Let's try it again.

789
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,909
So Talix is no longer with us.

790
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:11,340
We will try again later because like this seems to work.

791
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,139
We can't see the same servers.

792
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:19,719
And when we try to join them, when I last tried to do that, it, I got errors.

793
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:20,440
It was like error.

794
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,320
Could not join.

795
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,679
And I was just trying to refresh the list.

796
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:23,880
I would sit there for like 20 seconds.

797
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,440
It wouldn't do anything.

798
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,530
Should have set this up before the stream.

799
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:30,090
I did.

800
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,369
I mean, I don't know.

801
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,130
The server is going to have problems right now.

802
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,769
Right this second.

803
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:34,650
How am I supposed to know that?

804
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:48,230
What's the date?

805
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,349
What's the default FOV?

806
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:55,510
Let's find out.

807
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,389
I have it at 90.

808
00:49:56,949 --> 00:49:57,510
Should be more.

809
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,679
This is not going to count for points, right?

810
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:03,239
Should do a hundred.

811
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,739
A hundred might make me puke.

812
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,260
No, 95 is fine.

813
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,730
Yeah, this is too, this is, this is already, if I go more than this, I'll have a problem.

814
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:25,980
Yeah, when, when FOV is too high, it actually kind of sucks.

815
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:31,900
Because every time you turn, it's almost like you're looking through a telescope.

816
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,860
Sub 180.

817
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,579
How many players are here?

818
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,739
High ping and packet loss.

819
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:51,239
Uh-oh.

820
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:53,039
Uh-oh.

821
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,300
We may have hit the wall of playing a new game on the internet.

822
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,099
How new is this?

823
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:05,190
Didn't this come out like a week or two ago?

824
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,909
When did it come out?

825
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:09,610
Yesterday?

826
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,059
Oh, I forgot.

827
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:13,190
God damn it.

828
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,670
I forgot.

829
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,750
Any video game that releases for the first three days doesn't work.

830
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,789
I forgot.

831
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:19,510
God damn it.

832
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:45,030
My mistake is you got to wait for the first like week and a half to go by

833
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,550
from the, to patch the game three times.

834
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,809
And then you can play the game.

835
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,019
All right, I think we're starting.

836
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:13,909
You know what a game company should really do?

837
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:15,269
And maybe they do this, but who knows?

838
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,219
Do people do this?

839
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,820
Let me, let me ask you a question.

840
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,429
So if you had a video game that was releasing,

841
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:28,860
why wouldn't you just rent like an absolute shitload of servers?

842
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,980
Like too many, like a joke amount for like five days.

843
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,820
And then just turn them all off.

844
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:40,280
Just rent like an absolute dumb amount of servers for a month

845
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,000
and then just turn them off.

846
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:47,340
And then reduce it down to like the amount that you want.

847
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:55,579
All right, here we go.

848
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,380
That cost money though.

849
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:01,989
Yeah, I know.

850
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:05,590
Let's like, I'm not talking, this is not just like an independent studio thing.

851
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,909
This happens with like, does that, this happened with like Anthem too, didn't it?

852
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:12,920
I might be making that up.

853
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,000
Even AAA studios have the same problem.

854
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,980
All right, I'm gonna, this guy's fucking dead.

855
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,579
No, I'm just saying a triple, all right.

856
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,179
I'm gonna kill this guy with my bare hands.

857
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,619
No, I'm not, I'm gonna run away.

858
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,300
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna break my legs.

859
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,590
Shit, no, I don't have to, I don't have to read the queue now.

860
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,469
God damn it.

861
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,869
No, I was like, ah, I'm so fucking mad.

862
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,789
I just want to play.

863
00:53:51,670 --> 00:54:12,780
All right, I'm gonna pick the other game mode then.

864
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,230
Use the server browser.

865
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,269
I just tried and I got errors trying to use the browser.

866
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:33,829
This is a pretty good menu stream so far.

867
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,309
Breathe Arnold.

868
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:56,199
So I guess just don't queue for BR.

869
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:22,679
My god, you gotta talk to Chad about Sam and Max.

870
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:27,539
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it, don't worry.

871
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,780
I, this is a fun game though.

872
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,500
Fuck.

873
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:49,079
Okay, come on, show me something.

874
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,079
God, okay, I don't even care what it is.

875
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,300
Just let me play, right?

876
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,579
Okay, don't give me an error.

877
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:57,019
They gave me an error last time.

878
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,889
Oh my god, it's not full.

879
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,800
Oh my, I can't believe it.

880
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,199
Let's go.

881
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,179
Huntsman.

882
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:29,460
Now don't die immediately.

883
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:35,909
I got a cleaver too.

884
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:38,070
This is actually, this is exactly what I'd want as a weapon

885
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,429
if I was in a medieval time.

886
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:45,559
All right, is the way they're coming in through here?

887
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:49,739
Is that a magician?

888
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,900
I, I hit that guy right in the head.

889
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,150
No, I can't, give me my cleaver.

890
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:10,889
So are we defending a point or is it just team death match?

891
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:14,179
Is it friendly fire?

892
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:16,340
Ooh, see ya.

893
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:21,940
Oops.

894
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,460
No, there's no friendly fire.

895
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,300
Oh wait, doesn't look like they can have archers on the other team.

896
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,219
I'm going up.

897
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:56,420
Help this guy out.

898
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,219
Oops.

899
00:57:57,219 --> 00:57:59,719
Do they have any archers up?

900
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:02,440
Right there.

901
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,639
Oh, shit.

902
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:10,309
This guy's just wildly swinging.

903
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:15,690
I don't have any more, my bow is gone.

904
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,420
Did he knock the bow out of my hands?

905
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:26,980
Somebody said that guy is the headless ape swinging.

906
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,300
Oh shit.

907
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:47,619
I can do better than that.

908
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:50,420
Crazy man with cleaver charges into battle.

909
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,900
Guy's almost dead.

910
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,579
We're getting overrun.

911
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,099
I hit my teammate right in the head.

912
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm going in.

913
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,619
No, get up here.

914
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:41,300
Oh, almost.

915
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,500
I helped that dude out.

916
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,420
Guy crossed the way here right there, right in the head.

917
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,449
Bang.

918
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:52,329
God damn it, he moved.

919
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:53,369
The archer's so much fun.

920
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:03,429
Okay, I'm going to try something else.

921
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:04,789
How about knight?

922
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:09,750
This is just standard battle.

923
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,619
Stream sniped.

924
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,380
See, I told you.

925
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,179
Why'd you hit me?

926
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:25,300
Are you stream sniping me?

927
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:29,619
That guy just stream sniped me and he's on my own team.

928
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,539
See, look, this guy's stream sniping.

929
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:34,070
I'm going to fucking kill the stream sniper, watch this.

930
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:35,429
Oh, look at you.

931
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:37,030
Oh, you got the stream open?

932
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,260
No, it's not a stream sniper.

933
01:00:46,260 --> 01:01:00,920
Another stream sniper.

934
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,199
Welcome to VR.

935
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,079
Well, this isn't VR as it's just sticking around.

936
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:14,570
Here we go, one on one.

937
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,130
Don't hit me from...

938
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:26,980
Oh look, I'm not a stream sniper, huh?

939
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,420
You can't just run in there swinging and hitting walls, man.

940
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:34,460
Oh my god.

941
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,789
Shit, I got too many people there.

942
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:48,969
Dude, imagine that's how you die.

943
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:51,849
You'd probably still be alive for a second, right?

944
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:55,619
No, I don't think you would.

945
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:58,900
New class?

946
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,940
No, no, no, hold on.

947
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,300
Not yet, not quite.

948
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:07,349
Watch out.

949
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,340
Shit, where'd he go?

950
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Is there a way to heal?

951
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:35,449
Oh fuck, he just ducked under it.

952
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,059
This is fucking fun.

953
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:46,969
You passively regen when you don't use stamina, okay.

954
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,860
This is like a combination of chivalry and for honor.

955
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,500
This is fucking fun.

956
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,940
This is actually a lot of fun.

957
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:00,860
I'm glad I get to play it.

958
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,340
I'm gonna do some more techniques here, man.

959
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,739
Like for instance, this stream sniper over here.

960
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:12,420
Which one of these stream snipers should I go after?

961
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,059
This guy right here.

962
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:25,909
It's not that long.

963
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,420
God damn it.

964
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:40,360
It's actually kind of hard to hit somebody in the back if they're running.

965
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,119
Because you have to take this time to swing.

966
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,320
That guy had a smaller weapon.

967
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,500
But where did I just go?

968
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:50,380
If he was doing it to me?

969
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,659
Yeah, because he had like a little knife.

970
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,579
All right, I'm gonna make up for it right now.

971
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,539
I'm taking this guy's head off.

972
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:09,050
Oh, that wasn't a parry.

973
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:14,920
Somebody's behind me too.

974
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,159
Fuck.

975
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,360
Not good.

976
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,489
All right, let's try a raider.

977
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:26,940
This guy's got a huge axe.

978
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,539
I'm not gonna run in this time.

979
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:31,980
I'm gonna stay back.

980
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:36,409
It's too fun just to try to go and take somebody's head off though.

981
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:41,590
That guy just threw an axe at me.

982
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,539
This guy's throwing weapons.

983
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:55,179
That guy's throwing maces and shit.

984
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:56,699
All right, I'll take care of this.

985
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:09,960
Nice.

986
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,760
Good job.

987
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,039
This guy ain't not paying attention.

988
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:12,920
Not paying attention.

989
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,880
Free head.

990
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,360
Free head.

991
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,719
Damn it.

992
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:18,599
Wasn't enough damage.

993
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:23,349
Fuck.

994
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:23,849
No.

995
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,690
I have throwing axes, do I?

996
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,659
Oh shit, I do.

997
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:33,159
Okay.

998
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,289
What just hit me?

999
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:50,789
What?

1000
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:51,670
I just fall back.

1001
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:56,519
I just fell down.

1002
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,639
I just tripped.

1003
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:58,519
Are you coming down here?

1004
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,460
All right, fine.

1005
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,340
I'll come up there to you.

1006
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:04,650
You're gonna be dishonorable?

1007
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,150
You're gonna let me up?

1008
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,349
Fine, I'll put the axe away.

1009
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:09,050
Let's go.

1010
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:18,630
Is it?

1011
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:19,289
Oh, no, no.

1012
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:20,409
There's another guy.

1013
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:27,400
Get him.

1014
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:27,900
Get him.

1015
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,239
Get him.

1016
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,119
I'm distracting him.

1017
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:30,619
Get him.

1018
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,900
Hey, who did that?

1019
01:06:52,869 --> 01:06:53,909
I just got sniped.

1020
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,469
Like there's an actual sniper rifle up there in the kill feed.

1021
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:15,460
I love this.

1022
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:15,940
This is so...

1023
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:17,460
Oh man.

1024
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:20,420
All right, first time ever getting to really play.

1025
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,699
That was awesome.

1026
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,360
Reminds me of Fistful of Frags.

1027
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:32,840
It does.

1028
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,099
It really does.

1029
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:42,219
It's like Fistful of Frags.

1030
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,340
For honor and chivalry.

1031
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,420
It does have that Fistful of Frags feel.

1032
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:49,900
You're right.

1033
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,480
Uh, let's stay on the same team.

1034
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,360
Why not?

1035
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,489
What about protector?

1036
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,489
So I'm like the shield.

1037
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,730
I have to stay out in front of everybody, right?

1038
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:03,929
Smoke bomb?

1039
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:10,380
This is Dark Souls.

1040
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,739
The Dark Souls guy, yeah.

1041
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:15,349
Let's go.

1042
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,270
I will be your shield.

1043
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,720
And my bow.

1044
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,300
And my axe.

1045
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,239
Why is there not voice chat?

1046
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:29,239
I want to have people scream memes in my face.

1047
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,529
Um, speaking of people screaming memes in my face.

1048
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:40,539
What is that sound?

1049
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,199
Oops, no longer the shield.

1050
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,119
Sorry.

1051
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:59,829
Okay, this guy's just like Saitama.

1052
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:00,710
Why is he winning?

1053
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:04,579
It shouldn't be happening right now.

1054
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:16,220
Damn it.

1055
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:22,810
Got him.

1056
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:23,850
All right, all right, all right.

1057
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:24,729
Oh, all right.

1058
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:25,210
Who is it?

1059
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:29,270
Eat shit.

1060
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,329
Um, did I just kill somebody?

1061
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,090
I think I just killed somebody with the firework.

1062
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,010
That was a bad idea.

1063
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:39,350
Oh, no.

1064
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,630
Was that a bad guy?

1065
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:41,829
I couldn't tell in the smoke.

1066
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:50,010
I just, I just Stephen, I just Stephen King to that guy.

1067
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,449
They made a movie about what I just did.

1068
01:09:54,010 --> 01:10:07,699
Hitting somebody right in the face.

1069
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:08,420
Let's do it again.

1070
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,220
No, I don't have any more.

1071
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,060
No way.

1072
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,819
Somebody killed this fucking guy.

1073
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:24,340
It's a frying pan.

1074
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:29,829
Stop playing the guitar.

1075
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,069
All right, that's the only death I've had the whole time.

1076
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:42,470
Let's go.

1077
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:46,100
Oh, it's you doing that.

1078
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,260
I don't feel bad about that.

1079
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,539
Am I going to get banned for what I'm doing?

1080
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,020
Look, he's clearly being a nuisance.

1081
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:54,520
Okay.

1082
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,180
Clearly being a nuisance.

1083
01:10:57,529 --> 01:10:58,810
I don't get points taken down for that.

1084
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,090
That guy was a nuisance.

1085
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:10,859
Let me go in front.

1086
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:11,659
Let me get in front.

1087
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:17,939
Damn it.

1088
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:35,130
I don't know.

1089
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:35,630
Okay.

1090
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,659
I look like such an idiot right now.

1091
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,380
Come here.

1092
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:55,739
Damn it.

1093
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:00,539
All right, I'm going to change class.

1094
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:04,279
Uh, what is, uh, Brigand?

1095
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,079
Uh, Footman?

1096
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,520
Scoundrel?

1097
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:08,119
Engineer?

1098
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,710
I'm going with veteran.

1099
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:22,149
He's taunting?

1100
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,460
All right.

1101
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,020
Yeah, I was gonna say that's not a good idea for you to taunt right there.

1102
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:33,060
See ya.

1103
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,010
I'm going for an overhead smash right in this guy's head.

1104
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,119
Damn it.

1105
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:52,600
Too many.

1106
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,000
Too many.

1107
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,399
Too many.

1108
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:53,880
Too many.

1109
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,380
Too many.

1110
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,140
Too many.

1111
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:56,619
Too many.

1112
01:12:56,619 --> 01:12:57,340
Too many.

1113
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:03,430
Oh, here we go.

1114
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,909
What does he get?

1115
01:13:03,909 --> 01:13:05,750
So he's got Evening Star.

1116
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,170
This thing is huge.

1117
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,560
Wow, that does a lot.

1118
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:31,930
It's brutal.

1119
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,739
Oops, sorry.

1120
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:54,039
Oh, shit.

1121
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:54,539
Fuck.

1122
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,539
Oh, he fucking just baited me so hard.

1123
01:13:57,539 --> 01:14:02,300
I thought he turned around and ran.

1124
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,619
I thought he was, I looked like he was turning around to run.

1125
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:17,739
Look at the big chunk missing.

1126
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:21,850
Watch out.

1127
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,409
Naked guy.

1128
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:26,310
Naked guy with the pan.

1129
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,510
Oh, this is bad.

1130
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:31,210
This is really bad.

1131
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:38,170
Oh, fuck.

1132
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:38,810
Nope.

1133
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:49,699
Dude, I always have to get like, it's always like a 4v4v.

1134
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:50,500
Aw, team stack.

1135
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,619
Scramble the teams.

1136
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:57,380
Scramble the teams.

1137
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,420
Yo, you idiot.

1138
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:19,930
Get up.

1139
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,569
Oh, God.

1140
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:23,770
I'm team killing.

1141
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,409
So is he.

1142
01:15:25,289 --> 01:15:38,779
He's arguably killing more teammates than I am.

1143
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:39,579
What do you mean no?

1144
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:43,500
He's like standing in the way and, oh, my fucking God.

1145
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:54,409
I'm gonna go to, let's go Huntsman again.

1146
01:15:54,409 --> 01:16:15,899
Damn it.

1147
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:20,810
You're not gonna T-back me in my own stream?

1148
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:30,710
Fuck, he did.

1149
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,260
The loot gives health.

1150
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,380
Oh, I thought he was just like doing a taunt like command.

1151
01:16:45,380 --> 01:17:05,430
A little chip damage, not a big deal.

1152
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,710
Uh-oh, here they all come again.

1153
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:10,010
Watch out.

1154
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,569
Watch out.

1155
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:11,130
Watch out.

1156
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:12,810
Pick up your sword.

1157
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:32,359
Okay, good.

1158
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:33,640
Oh, I didn't get him in the head.

1159
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:59,539
Get out of here.

1160
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:00,260
I get it.

1161
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,460
Right here, right in the head.

1162
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,439
Damn it.

1163
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:02,840
Almost.

1164
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,239
Oh, boy.

1165
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:03,560
Oh, boy.

1166
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,359
Gotta make the shots count.

1167
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:05,479
The shots gotta count.

1168
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:05,960
Didn't count.

1169
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:11,859
Get.

1170
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,710
What is he doing?

1171
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:33,850
Oh, he's just stream sniping.

1172
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,970
That's what he's doing.

1173
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,859
Did he block that?

1174
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,590
He's blocking the arrows.

1175
01:18:56,789 --> 01:18:57,350
Damn it.

1176
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:02,600
Did it not hit him?

1177
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,880
Sounded like it hit him.

1178
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Damn it.

1179
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,000
I thought the guy was still next to me.

1180
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,180
Oh, I wanna go, I don't know.

1181
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,840
I haven't done this yet.

1182
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,420
You definitely wanna do a lot of stabs with this.

1183
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:39,079
Don't get baited out.

1184
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,119
They're trying to bait us.

1185
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:53,529
All right, this guy too.

1186
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:55,529
Oh, that's a lot of reach.

1187
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,560
This thing is nice.

1188
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,680
Shit.

1189
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,479
Watch out for this guy.

1190
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:12,340
Oh, come on.

1191
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:23,369
Spears are the best weapons.

1192
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:24,250
Oh, medic bag.

1193
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:25,609
Do I have to touch people with this

1194
01:20:25,609 --> 01:20:26,890
or do they just get healed if I near them?

1195
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:30,739
How'd you get to the side?

1196
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:38,579
Just drop it over here.

1197
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:42,170
I only get one.

1198
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,529
All right, so it's just behind here.

1199
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,569
Well, I thought they were gonna be fighting here.

1200
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:52,659
This way, doctor.

1201
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:54,329
Kind of.

1202
01:21:01,029 --> 01:21:03,430
You can buy weapons and customize a character.

1203
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,829
Really?

1204
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,489
That's actually really awesome.

1205
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,699
Nice.

1206
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,140
That was a good backswing.

1207
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:26,710
Good job.

1208
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,729
Why is the guy with the pants so good?

1209
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,439
Oh, fuck.

1210
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:45,159
There's somebody here.

1211
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:56,220
So it's currently bugged right now?

1212
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:56,699
That's okay.

1213
01:21:56,699 --> 01:21:57,020
I see.

1214
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:05,210
Parry.

1215
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:09,859
Oh, damn it.

1216
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:10,020
What?

1217
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:10,819
What?

1218
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,029
How did I not?

1219
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,260
I don't like it.

1220
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,789
Who have I not?

1221
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:20,310
What item have I not used?

1222
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:34,489
Try this.

1223
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:35,529
Oh, a zweander.

1224
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:39,659
What?

1225
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:49,500
All right, watch out.

1226
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,520
What do I have for a...

1227
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,880
Oh, I have this too.

1228
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,439
I have a shortser.

1229
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:54,840
That's good.

1230
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,270
That'll come in handy.

1231
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,939
The Nintendo's zweander?

1232
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,550
I'm gonna die in one hit.

1233
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,939
It was one of those medical sandbags.

1234
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:23,819
I need one.

1235
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:28,180
There we go.

1236
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:28,739
Oh, we win.

1237
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,600
64-person server.

1238
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:49,100
Should I try to get the 60?

1239
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,310
That'll be absolute chaos.

1240
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,430
All right, I'll go for it.

1241
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,930
What do I...

1242
01:23:56,489 --> 01:24:08,090
Server browser.

1243
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,689
All right, that's not quit game.

1244
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:10,010
That's a...

1245
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:14,729
That's not quit...

1246
01:24:14,729 --> 01:24:15,850
That's quit game.

1247
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,130
Does that take me to the menu?

1248
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,090
Or does that quit out?

1249
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:19,050
Okay.

1250
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,289
Some of these games just boot you out to the...

1251
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,329
They take you out of the whole game.

1252
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:36,119
I'll try like a huge one.

1253
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:37,720
You're gonna regret that, probably.

1254
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,600
But it's all good.

1255
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:45,609
Customized gear.

1256
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:46,409
I don't think I can, right?

1257
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:47,449
It's a bit messed up.

1258
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,779
Isn't it broken?

1259
01:24:53,029 --> 01:24:54,069
I don't have any money.

1260
01:24:54,069 --> 01:24:55,270
I'm not even getting currency.

1261
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:04,729
New mercenary.

1262
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:09,500
Zweander.

1263
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:11,619
Head.

1264
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,739
I'm gonna...

1265
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:16,779
I'll put peasant hair on.

1266
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:17,420
That sounds good.

1267
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:20,840
Torso.

1268
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:24,119
No, that's too easy.

1269
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:24,680
This one.

1270
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,239
Peasant, sure.

1271
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:26,199
I'm just gonna be a peasant.

1272
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,090
I'm just...

1273
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,130
I'll be really unassuming.

1274
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:36,619
Okay.

1275
01:25:36,619 --> 01:25:37,020
Legs.

1276
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:37,500
Workers.

1277
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,380
Shorts.

1278
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:38,779
Pants.

1279
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,930
That's fine.

1280
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:43,380
All right.

1281
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:43,779
Gear.

1282
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:44,260
Equipment.

1283
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,250
Oh.

1284
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,050
Cost of point.

1285
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,949
Yeah, I don't...

1286
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:51,829
I can't do any of this.

1287
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,670
I'm not getting any currency.

1288
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:01,560
Yeah, customization does not work right now.

1289
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:01,800
Okay.

1290
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,359
Well, that's all right.

1291
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,479
That's all good.

1292
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:09,619
I had 15?

1293
01:26:10,659 --> 01:26:12,180
I thought that I couldn't do it.

1294
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:13,859
Everyone just said it was down.

1295
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:32,220
For instance, okay, like dagger, right?

1296
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:36,859
Yeah, progression doesn't work.

1297
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,140
Oh, god damn it.

1298
01:26:43,619 --> 01:26:47,579
Did I just spend those or can I...

1299
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,659
Okay, wait, okay, okay, okay.

1300
01:26:49,659 --> 01:26:54,520
Peasant.

1301
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay.

1302
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,520
Why would that be a perk?

1303
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,939
What does that do?

1304
01:26:57,939 --> 01:27:01,939
Crouch movement speed.

1305
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:07,640
Cat.

1306
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,199
Friendly.

1307
01:27:09,449 --> 01:27:10,170
I like that one.

1308
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:13,060
Ranger.

1309
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:15,960
Scavenger.

1310
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:19,609
Dodge.

1311
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:21,939
That's actually really good.

1312
01:27:21,939 --> 01:27:22,500
Brawler.

1313
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:22,979
Might as well just...

1314
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:29,289
Wreck structures, repair.

1315
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:34,170
And bows, crossbows, and throwables deal more damage

1316
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,699
against enemies carrying the quiver.

1317
01:27:36,699 --> 01:27:38,220
Stimina on kill increased by...

1318
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,180
That's good.

1319
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,439
And we'll do fists.

1320
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:42,920
Why not?

1321
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:46,220
Peasant does not do anything.

1322
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,899
Well, why would it be eight points?

1323
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,420
Gain full health on a melee kill.

1324
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,939
Yeah, why would I not just select this?

1325
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:59,689
And then, like, fury.

1326
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:05,350
And instantly start sprinting upon killing an enemy.

1327
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,060
Gain three extra stamina on hit.

1328
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:10,539
That's good.

1329
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,560
Friendly fire reduction.

1330
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:17,560
Fine, I'll do rat.

1331
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:19,750
It's because I have to.

1332
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,420
And then, fatal melee and projectile damage

1333
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:25,899
except a headshot does not kill you immediately.

1334
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:27,779
Sure, why not?

1335
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:29,720
And then, that's it.

1336
01:28:30,579 --> 01:28:33,270
Okay, so that's it.

1337
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,189
But he doesn't have any items.

1338
01:28:35,829 --> 01:28:38,229
What does he have?

1339
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,949
He doesn't have anything.

1340
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:41,699
He has no equipment.

1341
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:44,180
I can't unlock this.

1342
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:46,710
None of these can be used.

1343
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,289
He's just gonna be fists.

1344
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:51,500
Well, then I have to...

1345
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,659
Well, then I have to take that off and go like that.

1346
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:58,710
All right, that's fine.

1347
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,649
I'm ready to go.

1348
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:05,210
So we're looking for a high.

1349
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:07,930
I get 64, 48.

1350
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:12,060
Okay, let's do 48 first.

1351
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:13,579
You know what I'm saying?

1352
01:29:13,579 --> 01:29:14,939
You know, I'm not gonna do 64.

1353
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:16,300
Right off the bat.

1354
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:26,899
All right, this one.

1355
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:32,390
There's a lot of people here.

1356
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:36,199
I have to choose my spawn point.

1357
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:38,470
Oh dear.

1358
01:29:39,829 --> 01:29:41,189
Capture the enemy flags.

1359
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:54,739
What?

1360
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:59,460
That probably looked so funny on their screen.

1361
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,380
That's why he's called this way, Ender.

1362
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,060
For this exact purpose.

1363
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:26,380
What does he got?

1364
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,020
No, I'll keep this.

1365
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,659
Whoa, fire bomb.

1366
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,720
Fuck, what was I thinking?

1367
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:37,000
Get this health over there.

1368
01:30:44,859 --> 01:30:45,739
No!

1369
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:46,539
From where?

1370
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:47,100
From behind?

1371
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:03,539
I'm gonna do a couple more times with this useless character.

1372
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,039
And I'm gonna go from there.

1373
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:06,680
Get a horse.

1374
01:31:09,449 --> 01:31:11,050
Enemy is capturing the rafters.

1375
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:12,739
Well, stop them.

1376
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:22,789
This guy's just laying out everybody.

1377
01:31:22,789 --> 01:31:28,539
Give me that thing.

1378
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:33,640
I'm gonna use my rat skills by crouching.

1379
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:36,470
I got 20% more crouch power.

1380
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:38,939
Jesus Christ.

1381
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:43,850
What?

1382
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:45,670
By what?

1383
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:47,699
Did I get my head cut off?

1384
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,229
All right, I wanna do...

1385
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:52,310
Let's go with like an actual character here.

1386
01:31:52,869 --> 01:32:06,619
All right, we took the rafters back.

1387
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:07,819
Good.

1388
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:10,069
Try engineer?

1389
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:10,710
Oh yeah, that's right.

1390
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:11,510
Okay.

1391
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:12,149
I will.

1392
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:16,020
All right, let's stay together.

1393
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:18,920
What's that thing?

1394
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:22,020
Stay together or die alone?

1395
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,239
Some video game had that for a tagline.

1396
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:26,359
It was a great tagline.

1397
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:35,909
Was it Vermintide?

1398
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:36,229
Was it?

1399
01:32:42,939 --> 01:32:44,140
Oh, that guy's on their team.

1400
01:32:59,260 --> 01:32:59,500
What?

1401
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,619
He took my arm off.

1402
01:33:00,619 --> 01:33:02,060
Oh god damn it.

1403
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:02,380
What?

1404
01:33:03,739 --> 01:33:05,579
I'm covered in plate armor.

1405
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:06,779
He took my arm off?

1406
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:09,140
What?

1407
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,180
Holy shit.

1408
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,039
Oh, that's my perk.

1409
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:22,359
Okay.

1410
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:24,380
I get it.

1411
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,260
That's funny.

1412
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:32,619
He's trying to run away.

1413
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:38,680
I love this shit, man.

1414
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,359
People just whacking at the walls.

1415
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,460
What is this guy doing?

1416
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:55,300
All right, only a couple more.

1417
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:01,899
Don't let up.

1418
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:02,539
How do we lose?

1419
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:03,500
We're standing here.

1420
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,659
Surprise me.

1421
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:06,939
Okay.

1422
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:11,829
What if we weren't standing in the capture point?

1423
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:17,899
Oh, reinforcement's okay.

1424
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:23,850
I'm never gonna rank up.

1425
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:25,529
I'll always be level one.

1426
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:28,060
Let's go here.

1427
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:38,220
I wonder if I get better.

1428
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,899
I gotta like practice and get better.

1429
01:34:45,689 --> 01:34:47,850
I want to do the other game modes too.

1430
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:50,010
All right.

1431
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,850
I've played with everybody except the engineer.

1432
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:52,970
So what does the engineer do?

1433
01:34:53,689 --> 01:35:02,569
Toolbox, loot, blacksmith, hammer.

1434
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:07,239
So I can do this now.

1435
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:12,260
Loot.

1436
01:35:12,819 --> 01:35:14,699
The hammer fixes the walls.

1437
01:35:15,739 --> 01:35:16,779
What does this do?

1438
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,579
I put down walls for people to hide behind?

1439
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:25,819
I guess.

1440
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:30,760
Oh, I can put down spikes too.

1441
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:31,720
All right.

1442
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,199
Well, here we go.

1443
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,930
Put the spikes down right here.

1444
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:41,560
Um, I really don't.

1445
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,039
I don't know.

1446
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:58,630
Come on.

1447
01:35:58,630 --> 01:35:59,270
Hurry up.

1448
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:05,699
All right.

1449
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:07,779
See, we got like a strategic location here now.

1450
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,359
Come here.

1451
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:23,319
Come here with that horse.

1452
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:35,880
Oh, I could have had a chance there with the hammer.

1453
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:36,920
Get back here.

1454
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:50,939
This is healing people, right?

1455
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,159
Oh, look at this.

1456
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:58,520
The internet is having problems.

1457
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,149
Oh, I thought I could really take him off.

1458
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:07,529
I'm gonna get him right here.

1459
01:37:07,529 --> 01:37:08,329
He doesn't even know I'm right.

1460
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:10,100
He doesn't know I'm chasing after him.

1461
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,380
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1462
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:11,699
It doesn't matter.

1463
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:14,579
I'll get him right here.

1464
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:16,619
Oh, what does this do?

1465
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:23,939
Repairing?

1466
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,699
I don't even know what I repaired.

1467
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:30,869
What is the loot?

1468
01:37:30,869 --> 01:37:31,590
The mandolin?

1469
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:36,569
It's, uh, I don't know.

1470
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:37,210
I think it heals.

1471
01:37:40,659 --> 01:37:41,779
Build a stables.

1472
01:37:41,779 --> 01:37:42,659
Do I have to do that?

1473
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:52,859
Oh, fuck.

1474
01:37:52,859 --> 01:38:00,810
Hold on.

1475
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,010
This is a bad guy, right?

1476
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:02,649
It is an enemy.

1477
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,779
Kill him with the horse.

1478
01:38:07,779 --> 01:38:08,279
Get him.

1479
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,180
Kill him.

1480
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:10,979
He's can't.

1481
01:38:10,979 --> 01:38:12,100
You can't let him get away.

1482
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,319
God damn it.

1483
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:26,520
I'm not even paying attention.

1484
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,710
I hit him off the horse.

1485
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:33,750
Oh, what the fuck?

1486
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:35,989
I don't want to be this guy anymore.

1487
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:38,630
I feel like I don't know enough about the game to be useful.

1488
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:43,020
We'll go back to Raider with the...

1489
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,079
Look, I'm going to help a little bit here.

1490
01:38:49,689 --> 01:38:50,329
The horn!

1491
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,409
The horn has been blown!

1492
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:59,909
Whatever.

1493
01:38:59,909 --> 01:39:00,390
Just give me...

1494
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:01,430
I want to be the Raider.

1495
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,920
He's helping.

1496
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:09,560
Not really.

1497
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:11,300
Now I'm going to help.

1498
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:11,779
Watch this.

1499
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,260
If I don't get at least three kills here

1500
01:39:14,979 --> 01:39:19,779
and clean not assists me get the kill,

1501
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:22,420
then bye bye Twitch channel.

1502
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:35,420
That was mine.

1503
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:41,420
And wait for it.

1504
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:41,819
Wait for him.

1505
01:39:41,819 --> 01:39:42,699
Wait for him.

1506
01:39:42,699 --> 01:39:43,659
I'll get him on the run and back.

1507
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:44,539
I'll get him on the run around here.

1508
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:45,739
He's going to come around here.

1509
01:39:45,739 --> 01:39:46,460
Watch this shit.

1510
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,789
Here he comes around the corner.

1511
01:39:48,789 --> 01:39:49,750
He's going to wrap around.

1512
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,630
Three, two, one.

1513
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,270
No, never mind.

1514
01:39:53,909 --> 01:40:23,189
Oh, by the way, if the game lags out, it doesn't count.

1515
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:43,930
One, two, three.

1516
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:48,760
Oops, three.

1517
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,170
That's mine.

1518
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,210
He had the last stand thing.

1519
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:53,609
I killed him.

1520
01:40:54,489 --> 01:41:04,340
This is mine.

1521
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,140
Mine.

1522
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:09,050
How is this guy still alive?

1523
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:16,310
I told you to leave me alone.

1524
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:18,619
Okay.

1525
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,939
Does that negate the other one?

1526
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:22,619
I think that negates it.

1527
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:23,579
Oh shit.

1528
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:29,670
Okay, run, run, run, run, run.

1529
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:32,260
That doesn't negate it.

1530
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:32,979
It doesn't negate it.

1531
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:33,380
I win.

1532
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:35,159
I got more than three.

1533
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:35,800
I got four.

1534
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:40,199
Oh my god.

1535
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:42,359
This game is fucking bonkers.

1536
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:46,600
That's four with a team kill.

1537
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,159
So it was minus one, which means it's three.

1538
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,579
He seriously just walked into it though.

1539
01:41:55,539 --> 01:41:57,619
How many people do you think back in medieval times

1540
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,659
like fucking killed each other accidentally?

1541
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:03,659
Think about this.

1542
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:05,340
If there was a giant battle like this shit,

1543
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:11,420
you're going to swing in a circle and you're going to hit five people.

1544
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:17,180
Don't ever charge in with anybody.

1545
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,500
Archer was where it was at.

1546
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:25,210
You couldn't accidentally take off a friend's head with an axe.

1547
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:30,810
Oh, that was pretty clean.

1548
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,689
That one hit right there.

1549
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:39,939
Oh shit.

1550
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:49,720
Come on.

1551
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,760
Oh, what's that?

1552
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:51,399
How did that feel?

1553
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:53,159
How did that one feel?

1554
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:53,880
Dude, there goes your head.

1555
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,119
All right.

1556
01:42:54,119 --> 01:42:55,399
I'm starting to get the hang of this shit.

1557
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:06,060
Oh, that was a little delay.

1558
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:13,189
This is pretty high.

1559
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:13,430
All right.

1560
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:14,789
Let's just let's get let's get back here.

1561
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:19,800
That wouldn't be the guy's shield.

1562
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:22,329
Oops.

1563
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,210
Oh, this thrusting swords.

1564
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:48,069
Is that me screaming?

1565
01:43:48,069 --> 01:43:48,869
What's the emotes?

1566
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:54,899
Oh, the scoundrel loadout.

1567
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:55,140
Okay.

1568
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:56,020
I actually I should do that.

1569
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:56,819
Let's try it.

1570
01:43:56,819 --> 01:43:58,340
Although I'm getting used to axe guy.

1571
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:00,699
A lot of people coming up.

1572
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:15,989
Oh, man.

1573
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:17,350
That guy got killed by something.

1574
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,670
I think that guy got trapped on here.

1575
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:23,140
He's playing like G mod death run.

1576
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,500
The guy like turned on the spikes.

1577
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:28,390
Oops.

1578
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:28,710
Sorry.

1579
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,140
Oh, yeah.

1580
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,739
That was team damage, but I killed somebody.

1581
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,539
It's okay.

1582
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:47,460
Oh, damn it.

1583
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,300
Went in for a big hit there.

1584
01:44:52,949 --> 01:44:53,829
Where do you think you're going?

1585
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:55,350
What was that guy doing?

1586
01:44:56,069 --> 01:44:57,850
There was no plan for that guy.

1587
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,090
Oh, I walked into it.

1588
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:00,329
Shit.

1589
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:05,989
Saying sorry won't grow that guy's arms back.

1590
01:45:05,989 --> 01:45:06,470
That's true.

1591
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:31,510
What the fuck?

1592
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:40,460
What?

1593
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,020
I must have got headshot by something.

1594
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:58,699
Why are these guys?

1595
01:45:58,699 --> 01:46:02,520
What are you guys doing?

1596
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,560
Guys, guys, guys.

1597
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:05,939
All right.

1598
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:07,300
We're going to have to quarantine this guy.

1599
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:11,430
Excuse me.

1600
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:12,710
Can we get a little help here?

1601
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,670
This guy went rogue.

1602
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:21,829
Oh, no.

1603
01:46:21,829 --> 01:46:23,989
He's been taken by the madness.

1604
01:46:23,989 --> 01:46:37,859
I kind of want to get in a horse

1605
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:47,430
and just ride around like an asshole like that.

1606
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:56,779
I thought there was a guy hiding.

1607
01:46:56,779 --> 01:46:57,500
Oh, damn it.

1608
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,220
That guy would have been dead.

1609
01:46:58,939 --> 01:46:59,939
What?

1610
01:46:59,939 --> 01:47:02,020
Just what is killing me from behind?

1611
01:47:02,739 --> 01:47:03,739
All right.

1612
01:47:03,739 --> 01:47:04,539
I want to do.

1613
01:47:04,539 --> 01:47:05,340
Whoops.

1614
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,760
Let's try scoundrel.

1615
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:12,600
It's me.

1616
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,590
Okay.

1617
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,229
So what do you have?

1618
01:47:18,229 --> 01:47:19,909
I got fireball.

1619
01:47:19,909 --> 01:47:21,109
This is the guy that's like the magician.

1620
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:21,350
Okay.

1621
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:29,479
So what's the swings like?

1622
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:31,800
A lot of thrusts, I would say, with this dude.

1623
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:40,789
There it is.

1624
01:47:42,569 --> 01:47:43,130
All right.

1625
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:43,529
Behind.

1626
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,699
Oh, shit.

1627
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:50,470
This guy ain't going to make it out alive.

1628
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,789
No.

1629
01:47:50,789 --> 01:47:51,670
Right into my sword.

1630
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:52,229
Come here.

1631
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:52,789
Right into it.

1632
01:47:56,279 --> 01:47:56,680
Really?

1633
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,119
What?

1634
01:48:08,119 --> 01:48:09,079
He don't go.

1635
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:10,279
God, I don't care.

1636
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:11,399
That was bullshit.

1637
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:14,090
You've got to be kidding me.

1638
01:48:21,609 --> 01:48:22,010
He can't...

1639
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:22,170
I...

1640
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,210
I don't even need to say anything.

1641
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:30,789
You guys already know.

1642
01:48:30,789 --> 01:48:38,090
You already know.

1643
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:38,569
Swing.

1644
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:39,369
What the hell?

1645
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:40,010
What the...

1646
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:40,569
Lag.

1647
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:41,130
Lag.

1648
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:41,689
Lag.

1649
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:42,170
Lag.

1650
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:42,489
Lag.

1651
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,859
I tried to swing again.

1652
01:48:45,859 --> 01:48:46,739
Input.

1653
01:48:46,739 --> 01:48:47,460
Wasn't.

1654
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:47,859
Done.

1655
01:48:47,859 --> 01:48:48,500
No input.

1656
01:48:49,140 --> 01:49:02,579
Oh, fuck.

1657
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:04,020
I have an arrow in my arm.

1658
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:12,579
What?

1659
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:14,409
What?

1660
01:49:17,449 --> 01:49:18,409
I was doing all right.

1661
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:22,439
He's a stab spammer.

1662
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,819
They're having server issues due to way more people playing it than expect...

1663
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:32,140
I thought that guy was aiming from my head.

1664
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:34,060
I need to use the fire bombs too.

1665
01:49:34,779 --> 01:49:37,180
Is that a...

1666
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:37,819
Who's up there?

1667
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:39,500
Is that a guy in red or blue?

1668
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,460
I can't tell.

1669
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,409
I think he's blue.

1670
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:45,699
All right.

1671
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:48,180
I'm going to put this down in a strategic location after I do this.

1672
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,399
Oops.

1673
01:49:53,960 --> 01:50:01,590
Did I just step in my own trap?

1674
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:04,949
I was too busy paying attention to what this guy was doing.

1675
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:09,289
Oh my god.

1676
01:50:09,289 --> 01:50:09,930
Okay.

1677
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,050
No more scoundrel.

1678
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:12,090
I'm going back to Raider.

1679
01:50:12,729 --> 01:50:16,460
That guy distracted me too much.

1680
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:18,300
That guy distracted me into another class.

1681
01:50:18,939 --> 01:50:27,180
What a god.

1682
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:29,739
I'm going.

1683
01:50:29,739 --> 01:50:30,300
You know what?

1684
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:31,260
I'll show you what I'm going to do.

1685
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:33,239
You want to see how we do this?

1686
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:35,319
How I would do this in a real war.

1687
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:39,130
I'll show you real war Elbertson right here.

1688
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:45,609
Oh, fuck.

1689
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:46,649
There's two of them.

1690
01:50:46,649 --> 01:50:47,500
I'm just kidding.

1691
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,220
This is not what I would do.

1692
01:50:48,859 --> 01:50:58,300
Is this the guy laughing at me?

1693
01:50:59,100 --> 01:50:59,819
There's too many.

1694
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:09,079
That guy didn't come over and start distracting me into another class.

1695
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:11,460
All right.

1696
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,579
We're getting kind of destroyed here.

1697
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:16,899
Press V.

1698
01:51:17,539 --> 01:51:20,149
That's pretty good.

1699
01:51:20,949 --> 01:51:21,800
All right.

1700
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,399
I should be able to get this guy from behind here.

1701
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,090
Play it smart.

1702
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,210
This guy's distracted.

1703
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:30,489
Oh, caught him.

1704
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:33,960
What?

1705
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,720
What happened to my sword?

1706
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:36,680
My axe?

1707
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:36,840
My...

1708
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:38,539
Okay.

1709
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,260
I think it's because maybe the packet loss removed it.

1710
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:50,640
Ah!

1711
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,300
Oh no, I'm stuck.

1712
01:51:56,229 --> 01:51:58,310
God.

1713
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:58,789
Get it!

1714
01:52:02,979 --> 01:52:04,180
You little weasel.

1715
01:52:04,819 --> 01:52:05,939
Nobody can catch him.

1716
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,100
He's taking down our defenses.

1717
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:09,899
All right.

1718
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:10,380
Pickle.

1719
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:11,500
Just like in baseball.

1720
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,539
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1721
01:52:12,539 --> 01:52:13,340
You little rabbit.

1722
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:18,659
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1723
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:23,399
We were just chasing that guy in a circle and nobody could catch him.

1724
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:31,739
We were gonna pickle him and it didn't work.

1725
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:33,100
All right.

1726
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:37,979
I'm gonna start playing the game again because I was top five and I'm like in the bottom.

1727
01:52:44,649 --> 01:52:45,369
Okay.

1728
01:52:45,369 --> 01:52:47,000
They're in our fort now.

1729
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:47,560
This is bad.

1730
01:52:48,199 --> 01:53:03,189
I got it.

1731
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:04,710
Relax.

1732
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:05,430
Everybody relax.

1733
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:08,149
They're gonna drop down here.

1734
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,710
Watch this.

1735
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:15,479
He's gonna drop down, isn't he?

1736
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:15,880
Drop down.

1737
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,279
All right.

1738
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:23,000
Well, I made the board shake so he fell.

1739
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:27,319
What is going on?

1740
01:53:28,659 --> 01:53:29,689
What?

1741
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:30,189
Ow.

1742
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:31,289
Ow.

1743
01:53:31,289 --> 01:53:31,930
Oh, there's a lot.

1744
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,409
Never mind.

1745
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:53,380
I somehow ended up back here and he ended up behind me.

1746
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,300
I swung at that guy and then I teleported back and the guy was behind me and killed me.

1747
01:54:00,939 --> 01:54:01,819
What the heck?

1748
01:54:02,619 --> 01:54:03,500
No swear is here.

1749
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:05,340
Only H-E-C-K.

1750
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,739
They're gonna take it right now.

1751
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:17,779
I'm trying to get this dude that's running behind.

1752
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:20,300
Damn it.

1753
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:21,899
Damn it.

1754
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:22,619
Oh my god.

1755
01:54:22,619 --> 01:54:23,180
I helped him.

1756
01:54:28,579 --> 01:54:29,300
Wait.

1757
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:30,579
That guy turned to dust.

1758
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,260
How does that make it?

1759
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:32,739
He said.

1760
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:33,300
Oh, no, no, no.

1761
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:33,859
He threw it.

1762
01:54:33,859 --> 01:54:34,579
Okay.

1763
01:54:34,579 --> 01:54:35,899
All right.

1764
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:36,859
Get up on the battlements.

1765
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:43,399
They're killing each other.

1766
01:54:46,199 --> 01:54:47,000
No, too many.

1767
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,560
You're dead, man.

1768
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,359
You can't be over there.

1769
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:51,319
I gotta help them.

1770
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:53,399
I'm going this way.

1771
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,079
They're coming up here.

1772
01:54:57,079 --> 01:54:57,960
Scoundrel.

1773
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,319
I'm taking his head off now.

1774
01:54:59,319 --> 01:55:00,520
You're not gonna get away with this shit.

1775
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:04,500
Not this time.

1776
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:08,409
Wrap around back.

1777
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:15,689
Oh, this is bad.

1778
01:55:15,689 --> 01:55:16,010
They know.

1779
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:29,979
Oh, kill the archer.

1780
01:55:29,979 --> 01:55:30,619
Kill the archer.

1781
01:55:30,619 --> 01:55:31,260
Kill the archer.

1782
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:34,979
Kill the archer.

1783
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:36,420
Oh, I had too many people behind me.

1784
01:55:45,189 --> 01:55:48,090
15.

1785
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,050
Die to the archer?

1786
01:55:50,229 --> 01:55:52,229
No, I died to archer.

1787
01:55:52,869 --> 01:55:53,989
I finally got money.

1788
01:55:54,859 --> 01:55:58,060
You're talking about died to the eight people that were behind me.

1789
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:03,739
Oh, I think that we cannot.

1790
01:56:03,739 --> 01:56:04,460
Is it gonna be good?

1791
01:56:07,579 --> 01:56:08,380
I like this game mode, though.

1792
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,180
It's fun.

1793
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:14,949
Progression seems to be working.

1794
01:56:16,649 --> 01:56:22,729
That's good.

1795
01:56:22,729 --> 01:56:24,090
Chase that paper.

1796
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:26,890
I want to see what other weapons they have.

1797
01:56:27,449 --> 01:56:29,850
All right.

1798
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:30,489
Who do I like?

1799
01:56:32,739 --> 01:56:35,829
I don't know.

1800
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:37,989
They're all kind of fun to play.

1801
01:56:37,989 --> 01:56:38,949
We try archer again.

1802
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,739
Unarmed or bust?

1803
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:53,420
No, I'm not very good with unarmed.

1804
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,819
Can we both get on?

1805
01:57:01,189 --> 01:57:03,510
There's many more weapons for you to customize.

1806
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,069
That's awesome.

1807
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:07,689
So we got our first.

1808
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:19,720
Oh, that was a guy in VR chat.

1809
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:23,140
I'm gonna go this way.

1810
01:57:23,699 --> 01:57:25,670
I think they're wrapping around over here.

1811
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:32,890
Yeah.

1812
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:36,060
Watch out.

1813
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,180
Get off the horse.

1814
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:38,520
Yeah.

1815
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,239
Oh, fuck.

1816
01:57:43,239 --> 01:57:45,319
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

1817
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,979
Oh, I'm dead.

1818
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:53,100
I just ran in with the horse.

1819
01:57:58,539 --> 01:57:59,979
You've been hunted.

1820
01:57:59,979 --> 01:58:01,529
I'm gonna get a good perch.

1821
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:06,649
Looks like we're right in the middle.

1822
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:09,899
What's with all the swords there?

1823
01:58:09,899 --> 01:58:10,939
This guy's taking out everybody.

1824
01:58:10,939 --> 01:58:11,260
Really?

1825
01:58:11,979 --> 01:58:13,770
Come on.

1826
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:15,909
He just took out three people.

1827
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:25,819
This guy is killing everyone.

1828
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:37,420
Oh my god.

1829
01:58:39,819 --> 01:58:41,979
I've done 50 something damage to him so far.

1830
01:58:42,779 --> 01:58:43,500
Did I kill him?

1831
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:45,850
Jesus.

1832
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:47,529
That guy was unstoppable.

1833
01:58:47,529 --> 01:59:13,449
Got him.

1834
01:59:13,449 --> 01:59:14,329
Damn.

1835
01:59:14,329 --> 01:59:25,430
I'm actually glad that the arrows are hard to use

1836
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,489
because they're not.

1837
01:59:27,449 --> 01:59:27,850
Oh my god.

1838
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:28,489
There's somebody up here.

1839
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:32,420
It's hard to use the bow.

1840
01:59:32,979 --> 01:59:38,250
You got to be really, really precise.

1841
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,689
But it kind of has to be like that

1842
01:59:39,689 --> 01:59:41,689
because otherwise it'd be really, really powerful.

1843
01:59:41,689 --> 01:59:43,449
It was really, really easy to use.

1844
01:59:53,699 --> 01:59:54,739
There's crossbows.

1845
01:59:54,739 --> 01:59:55,140
Are there?

1846
01:59:55,699 --> 01:59:57,180
That's interesting.

1847
01:59:57,739 --> 01:59:58,140
All right.

1848
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,380
I got him.

1849
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,500
I got to kill him right away.

1850
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:10,329
Oh, fuck.

1851
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:11,689
He threw a fly.

1852
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:13,210
I'm just being a dickhead now.

1853
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:13,529
All right.

1854
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,140
Back to Raider.

1855
02:00:15,699 --> 02:00:22,470
I'm trying to do too many things.

1856
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:24,949
Stay with one thing and do it well.

1857
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:27,079
I'm jumping around too much.

1858
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:45,960
Okay.

1859
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:46,359
Let's go.

1860
02:00:52,869 --> 02:00:53,670
Bring out the knives.

1861
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:12,010
Oh, I got him right in the head.

1862
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:12,649
Shit.

1863
02:01:12,649 --> 02:01:13,449
All right.

1864
02:01:13,449 --> 02:01:14,010
This is bad.

1865
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:17,460
I don't want to be on the bridge.

1866
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:20,500
Bridge bad because I can do that.

1867
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:20,819
Yeah.

1868
02:01:20,819 --> 02:01:21,300
Okay.

1869
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:22,420
Well, is that...

1870
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:23,300
Does somebody...

1871
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:27,239
I didn't get team killed, right?

1872
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,600
No, I did.

1873
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,159
No, I didn't.

1874
02:01:39,899 --> 02:01:40,859
Can you cut the bridge?

1875
02:01:40,859 --> 02:01:42,220
You might be able to.

1876
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:42,539
Maybe.

1877
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:52,090
This guy is...

1878
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:53,699
Needs to die.

1879
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:54,819
I'm going to go straight on.

1880
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:07,449
That hurts.

1881
02:02:07,449 --> 02:02:08,409
Is he alive?

1882
02:02:08,409 --> 02:02:09,220
He's alive.

1883
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:11,020
Fuck.

1884
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,579
I thought he was dead.

1885
02:02:13,579 --> 02:02:14,300
He went on the ground.

1886
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:25,210
I was hoping I was going to catch somebody.

1887
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:25,930
One of those.

1888
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:27,050
Just right like in the face.

1889
02:02:27,689 --> 02:02:28,170
All right.

1890
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:28,649
Not good.

1891
02:02:29,369 --> 02:02:29,850
I'm going to go.

1892
02:02:30,569 --> 02:02:36,979
Watch out for the fire.

1893
02:02:36,979 --> 02:02:38,180
When the fire goes, I'm going.

1894
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,649
They're climbing up and in.

1895
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,409
They're going inside.

1896
02:02:42,409 --> 02:02:44,180
They're up here.

1897
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,390
They're already in.

1898
02:02:47,909 --> 02:02:48,550
Oh, shit.

1899
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:49,270
That guy looked blue.

1900
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,229
Look at how blue that guy looks.

1901
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:50,789
I'm so sorry.

1902
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:53,109
He looked blue in the shadow.

1903
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:53,989
He did.

1904
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:55,189
He really did.

1905
02:02:55,189 --> 02:03:10,869
Are they clear out of here?

1906
02:03:10,869 --> 02:03:11,270
Yeah.

1907
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:11,909
We're good.

1908
02:03:11,909 --> 02:03:18,100
Nice.

1909
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,140
He's almost dead.

1910
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:30,779
Cleaved.

1911
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:37,670
Oh, shit.

1912
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:37,989
Bad.

1913
02:03:39,369 --> 02:03:40,890
I had a chance there.

1914
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:52,489
Can you still do the overhead swing?

1915
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:54,739
You can do this.

1916
02:03:55,619 --> 02:03:59,020
And then that's a little stab there.

1917
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:03,529
The poke with the axe seems pretty bad.

1918
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,409
Yeah, I would assume it would be.

1919
02:04:06,409 --> 02:04:08,460
Just try to change it up so they don't think

1920
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,819
you're going to do the same swing every time.

1921
02:04:18,569 --> 02:04:20,329
I hit that guy right in the lip.

1922
02:04:20,329 --> 02:04:21,529
I busted that guy's lip.

1923
02:04:21,529 --> 02:04:22,489
I just gave a fat lip.

1924
02:04:22,489 --> 02:04:23,130
That's all I did.

1925
02:04:24,579 --> 02:04:25,060
Goodbye.

1926
02:04:27,659 --> 02:04:29,180
How that guy blocked so many hits.

1927
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:30,060
What a fucking pro.

1928
02:04:30,779 --> 02:04:32,340
I ain't going to let you do that shit.

1929
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:32,819
Sorry, dude.

1930
02:04:39,239 --> 02:04:41,640
No, somebody had to deal with you.

1931
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,840
It might as well have been me.

1932
02:04:49,319 --> 02:04:49,819
Goodbye.

1933
02:04:52,659 --> 02:04:53,460
Huge cleave.

1934
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:53,859
I love it.

1935
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,680
Oops.

1936
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,000
Hold on.

1937
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:01,640
I'll help you here.

1938
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:05,210
Oh, damn it.

1939
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,850
I was trying to help.

1940
02:05:06,489 --> 02:05:07,989
We're going to kill each other in here.

1941
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,159
All right.

1942
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:12,359
With just too many of us in here.

1943
02:05:12,359 --> 02:05:12,920
This is bad.

1944
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:16,869
That motherfucker is still alive.

1945
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:20,470
Remarkably.

1946
02:05:21,029 --> 02:05:25,609
Okay, I'm going up this way.

1947
02:05:26,170 --> 02:05:30,840
We're going to push out of here.

1948
02:05:31,930 --> 02:05:32,569
Oh, dear.

1949
02:05:32,569 --> 02:05:33,130
They got a horse.

1950
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:39,899
Where's he going?

1951
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:42,810
He's all the way around.

1952
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,409
He's going to wrap inside of here.

1953
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:49,880
Where the hell did he go?

1954
02:05:54,789 --> 02:05:56,310
He keeps fucking team killing.

1955
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:58,069
You fucking idiots.

1956
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,260
That's not my team.

1957
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,779
You can't blame that one on me, guys.

1958
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,380
Not my team.

1959
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:21,930
Oh, shit from behind.

1960
02:06:21,930 --> 02:06:22,329
Damn it.

1961
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:24,170
I was going to look behind me, too.

1962
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:30,149
Who knew this would get so heated in chat?

1963
02:06:30,869 --> 02:06:39,050
This dude's fucking team killing.

1964
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:40,729
You fucking idiots.

1965
02:06:41,449 --> 02:06:48,149
Is there a way to shit from the front?

1966
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:50,810
Oh, I see what you're doing here.

1967
02:06:54,069 --> 02:06:54,550
Damn it.

1968
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:55,350
Fire sucks.

1969
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:03,750
Did I get his leg off?

1970
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:14,390
Holy shit.

1971
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:15,590
I went backwards.

1972
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:25,479
Was he hopping on one leg?

1973
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:26,039
It looked like it.

1974
02:07:26,039 --> 02:07:26,279
Yeah.

1975
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:30,069
All right.

1976
02:07:30,069 --> 02:07:30,869
Another string of legs.

1977
02:07:30,869 --> 02:07:31,829
Three, four in a row here.

1978
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:34,390
I got to climb back up to like top five.

1979
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,189
Come on.

1980
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:38,489
I can't just be this bad.

1981
02:07:38,489 --> 02:07:39,130
I have to be good.

1982
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:47,770
This is the first little area.

1983
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,890
This is where it's contested.

1984
02:07:49,449 --> 02:07:49,930
You know what?

1985
02:07:50,489 --> 02:07:54,180
Is it...

1986
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:55,619
Do I die if I go in the water?

1987
02:07:55,619 --> 02:07:57,220
I don't know if water's an instant kill.

1988
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:05,140
All right.

1989
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:05,939
Here's the conflict.

1990
02:08:06,579 --> 02:08:07,880
Watch from behind.

1991
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:14,739
Who keeps team killing?

1992
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:15,859
You fucking idiot.

1993
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:21,140
Let's check in behind.

1994
02:08:22,979 --> 02:08:24,180
There's a person behind.

1995
02:08:24,739 --> 02:08:29,859
Is he still there?

1996
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:37,130
Oh, you think you can escape me?

1997
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:43,609
Oops.

1998
02:08:46,579 --> 02:08:47,060
Oh shit.

1999
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:47,539
No.

2000
02:08:47,539 --> 02:08:47,859
I didn't...

2001
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:54,409
I was locked in tunnel vision again.

2002
02:08:54,409 --> 02:08:56,170
Trying to hit that guy with an axe on the bridge.

2003
02:08:56,890 --> 02:09:09,369
Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.

2004
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:14,489
Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.

2005
02:09:14,489 --> 02:09:14,810
What?

2006
02:09:21,930 --> 02:09:23,130
Well, I don't want to hit them.

2007
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:32,340
It's going to be the same shit to you, man.

2008
02:09:32,979 --> 02:09:39,180
Too many, too many, too many.

2009
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:39,579
They're all...

2010
02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:42,390
Too many.

2011
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:44,390
Too many.

2012
02:09:45,109 --> 02:09:48,939
I got to get like...

2013
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:52,260
Look at this ping.

2014
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,800
Everyone's ping jumps up to like 400.

2015
02:09:56,439 --> 02:10:11,750
How many tickets do we need?

2016
02:10:12,939 --> 02:10:14,060
What are we playing until?

2017
02:10:15,159 --> 02:10:16,520
I'm sort of confused.

2018
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:17,880
Is it like 1,800?

2019
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:27,500
I really want to just dig in there.

2020
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:33,850
Thank you.

2021
02:10:38,409 --> 02:10:39,529
That's what I wanted to do.

2022
02:10:40,409 --> 02:10:41,529
Just dig the fuck in.

2023
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:48,359
No, fuck.

2024
02:10:48,359 --> 02:10:50,920
Oh, I'm so tunneled in.

2025
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:55,750
I'm so tunneled in.

2026
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:56,470
I just get...

2027
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:58,869
All I think of is hit guy and face with axe.

2028
02:10:59,430 --> 02:11:08,579
I just...

2029
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:10,739
Me swing axe.

2030
02:11:11,699 --> 02:11:13,220
Me do damage to face.

2031
02:11:13,859 --> 02:11:17,060
What about limbs?

2032
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:17,300
No.

2033
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:20,630
What about throw the axe?

2034
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:21,909
No.

2035
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:25,750
Only damage in face.

2036
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:27,319
Only.

2037
02:11:29,319 --> 02:11:29,960
You're an idiot.

2038
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:36,619
Okay.

2039
02:11:36,619 --> 02:11:38,460
Me only damage in face.

2040
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:01,369
Me run.

2041
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:05,430
Me run.

2042
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:12,520
Is that guy red?

2043
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,069
Why is he blue?

2044
02:12:14,069 --> 02:12:16,420
He's got blue tint all over him.

2045
02:12:18,869 --> 02:12:19,590
Me hit.

2046
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:21,189
Me don't care if team or not.

2047
02:12:21,189 --> 02:12:21,909
Me hit face.

2048
02:12:27,159 --> 02:12:27,640
Me miss.

2049
02:12:31,239 --> 02:12:45,270
Me not very good at game.

2050
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:47,350
Me not understand how ping work

2051
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:50,789
seemed like should have landed.

2052
02:12:53,829 --> 02:12:54,390
Me dead.

2053
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:54,789
Ah.

2054
02:13:04,729 --> 02:13:05,210
No, stay...

2055
02:13:05,850 --> 02:13:06,489
What do I play?

2056
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:07,930
Footman?

2057
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:08,810
I don't know.

2058
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:09,289
I just...

2059
02:13:09,289 --> 02:13:10,170
I'm so excited.

2060
02:13:15,319 --> 02:13:16,840
Hey, can you stop hitting teammates?

2061
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:19,539
No.

2062
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:20,789
Why?

2063
02:13:20,789 --> 02:13:21,510
It's not that hard.

2064
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:22,149
We have different...

2065
02:13:22,869 --> 02:13:23,590
Everyone's a different...

2066
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:24,630
We're the same color.

2067
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:27,579
Red.

2068
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:28,380
Yes.

2069
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:29,420
Okay.

2070
02:13:29,979 --> 02:13:31,369
Me hit red.

2071
02:13:31,369 --> 02:13:31,609
No.

2072
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:40,979
I don't want you to hit red.

2073
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,500
Me go for blue.

2074
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,920
I try.

2075
02:13:49,479 --> 02:13:52,340
Well, try harder, stupid.

2076
02:13:53,239 --> 02:13:53,560
Okay.

2077
02:14:15,289 --> 02:14:16,170
Hey, don't do that.

2078
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:20,680
What?

2079
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:20,920
What?

2080
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,359
I'm fucking confused.

2081
02:14:23,079 --> 02:14:41,369
Good thing he...

2082
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:43,289
Don't do the joke play.

2083
02:14:43,930 --> 02:14:52,300
I had an opportunity there.

2084
02:14:52,300 --> 02:15:00,039
I had an opportunity to kill two, three people in a row.

2085
02:15:00,039 --> 02:15:13,579
I got a medic bag.

2086
02:15:13,579 --> 02:15:15,750
All right, let's give some poke.

2087
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:19,770
Poke, poke, poke.

2088
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:20,970
Find the opportunity.

2089
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:23,210
Don't get involved in a situation

2090
02:15:23,210 --> 02:15:24,569
where you're going to get yourself killed.

2091
02:15:25,699 --> 02:15:26,500
Take it easy.

2092
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:26,739
That's...

2093
02:15:33,449 --> 02:15:34,010
Okay.

2094
02:15:34,010 --> 02:15:35,369
I just stepped into the bonfire.

2095
02:15:35,369 --> 02:15:35,770
What was that guy?

2096
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:37,930
That guy was holding his weapon the other way?

2097
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:38,489
Oh, right.

2098
02:15:38,489 --> 02:15:39,770
Okay, that was confusing the fuck out of me.

2099
02:15:40,329 --> 02:15:42,170
Can I do that?

2100
02:15:43,369 --> 02:15:44,090
What does that do?

2101
02:15:44,810 --> 02:15:49,000
Does every weapon have, like, a different way to hold it?

2102
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:52,069
I don't think so.

2103
02:15:52,630 --> 02:15:58,359
Most of them do.

2104
02:15:58,359 --> 02:15:58,600
Okay.

2105
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:00,420
So now it makes it...

2106
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:15,460
Stab.

2107
02:16:17,529 --> 02:16:17,930
Stab.

2108
02:16:22,729 --> 02:16:23,529
Really?

2109
02:16:23,529 --> 02:16:29,850
How did that not land?

2110
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:31,449
I'm trying to kick him off the fucking edge.

2111
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:35,579
Did I?

2112
02:16:35,579 --> 02:16:41,940
What happened?

2113
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:43,379
I think he fell off.

2114
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:44,739
I did.

2115
02:16:44,739 --> 02:16:45,860
I did what I wanted to do.

2116
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:46,899
Yeah, he's dead.

2117
02:16:46,899 --> 02:16:47,299
He's dead.

2118
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:48,899
Get the horse?

2119
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,540
I feel like there's only one horse, and it only spawns...

2120
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:54,329
We have one horse.

2121
02:16:54,969 --> 02:17:05,159
Oh, he had the five second life perk.

2122
02:17:05,159 --> 02:17:08,409
I did kill him, though.

2123
02:17:08,409 --> 02:17:09,690
That guy's coming in so much blood.

2124
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:12,979
All right.

2125
02:17:12,979 --> 02:17:13,299
Let's pick...

2126
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,260
Oh, come on.

2127
02:17:20,899 --> 02:17:21,540
Really?

2128
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:24,260
Why the fuck am I so focused?

2129
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:27,670
These huge, huge player battles...

2130
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:29,590
My brain.

2131
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:31,739
It's just...

2132
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:36,459
I get locked into one thing for more than one second, and I'm dead.

2133
02:17:36,459 --> 02:17:38,309
Let's go knight.

2134
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:46,040
When there's 50 people on the battlefield, I'm just like,

2135
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:48,440
wait, what about this guy up there?

2136
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:49,639
Oh, he's dancing.

2137
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:50,920
Oh, that's fun.

2138
02:17:51,559 --> 02:17:52,700
And then I'm dead.

2139
02:17:53,340 --> 02:18:03,739
Hit ah?

2140
02:18:03,739 --> 02:18:04,459
Do ah?

2141
02:18:04,459 --> 02:18:04,860
All right.

2142
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:05,739
I will.

2143
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:14,180
I'm trying to just do not...

2144
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:16,340
It's so easy to hit somebody in the head you don't want to hit.

2145
02:18:22,739 --> 02:18:23,059
All right.

2146
02:18:23,059 --> 02:18:23,780
I helped.

2147
02:18:32,790 --> 02:18:33,750
Ooh, got them both.

2148
02:18:34,969 --> 02:18:35,290
Ooh.

2149
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:44,950
All right.

2150
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:47,430
Give me that.

2151
02:18:47,430 --> 02:18:47,750
Whoa.

2152
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:56,010
All right.

2153
02:18:56,010 --> 02:19:01,819
We're clearing them out.

2154
02:19:01,819 --> 02:19:04,309
Hey, don't do that.

2155
02:19:04,309 --> 02:19:09,110
Right into my trap that I didn't lay.

2156
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:15,979
Archer.

2157
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:19,000
Oh, that was delayed.

2158
02:19:22,819 --> 02:19:23,299
What?

2159
02:19:23,299 --> 02:19:23,780
I'm...

2160
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:24,100
Okay.

2161
02:19:26,809 --> 02:19:28,329
That was odd.

2162
02:19:28,329 --> 02:19:29,979
Of course I...

2163
02:19:29,979 --> 02:19:31,340
Okay, of course I get hit.

2164
02:19:31,899 --> 02:19:39,530
I'm the one that takes the one hit in the head and dies.

2165
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:52,809
I'm actually pulling it back.

2166
02:19:52,809 --> 02:20:00,579
It always happens to me.

2167
02:20:00,579 --> 02:20:01,620
It never happens to anybody else.

2168
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:02,899
It only happens to me.

2169
02:20:02,899 --> 02:20:04,819
It's not fair.

2170
02:20:04,819 --> 02:20:09,420
Like, this guy doesn't have to deal with high ping.

2171
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:09,739
Only me.

2172
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:12,329
Okay.

2173
02:20:12,329 --> 02:20:13,129
This is a bad idea.

2174
02:20:28,809 --> 02:20:29,850
You're running into me.

2175
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:32,809
Oh, god damn it.

2176
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:37,700
I'm just like in the worst place at the worst time, apparently.

2177
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:50,420
Oh, now I'm trapped in here.

2178
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:55,030
This is not a place I want to be.

2179
02:20:55,590 --> 02:20:56,780
Too many bodies.

2180
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:05,079
Anybody know what killed me?

2181
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:11,909
That wasn't an arrow.

2182
02:21:11,909 --> 02:21:12,950
It was a mace.

2183
02:21:12,950 --> 02:21:30,440
Like a mace.

2184
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,280
That's a team damage.

2185
02:21:38,969 --> 02:21:53,909
What are you doing here?

2186
02:21:53,909 --> 02:21:57,530
No, no, no, no, no.

2187
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:58,649
Oh, god damn it.

2188
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:14,549
It's just such a mess.

2189
02:22:14,549 --> 02:22:15,750
Oh, sorry.

2190
02:22:16,629 --> 02:22:16,950
Sorry.

2191
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:18,389
It was just medieval times.

2192
02:22:18,389 --> 02:22:19,510
It just happens.

2193
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:23,899
I'm getting up there.

2194
02:22:23,899 --> 02:22:25,340
Somebody hit that guy.

2195
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:31,000
I'm gonna fucking throw an axe at this guy.

2196
02:22:37,559 --> 02:22:40,280
Oh, he just moved at the fucking worst time.

2197
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:55,319
He died.

2198
02:22:55,319 --> 02:22:56,420
He fell.

2199
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:57,379
It's okay.

2200
02:22:57,379 --> 02:22:58,420
I've done it before, too.

2201
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:07,799
Fuck, too many.

2202
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:27,180
How are we still ahead?

2203
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:29,260
I think the axe is my favorite weapon.

2204
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:32,700
The bow is my favorite weapon, but I can't use it because I'm not good enough.

2205
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:33,959
And I've accepted that.

2206
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:46,940
Jesus Christ.

2207
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:49,510
Jesus, man.

2208
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:50,870
What, do I have a target on my back?

2209
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:53,350
There's like four people.

2210
02:24:03,209 --> 02:24:23,049
It was like four of us standing there.

2211
02:24:23,049 --> 02:24:24,489
Upset because angry.

2212
02:24:24,489 --> 02:24:25,690
Mad because bad.

2213
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:26,569
Bad because bad.

2214
02:24:37,829 --> 02:24:38,549
He blocked him.

2215
02:24:38,549 --> 02:24:39,350
He's blocking me.

2216
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:41,030
We're just throwing rocks at this guy.

2217
02:24:44,139 --> 02:24:53,059
What?

2218
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:54,100
All right.

2219
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:58,649
This guy's gotta go.

2220
02:24:58,649 --> 02:24:59,209
Where is he?

2221
02:25:15,559 --> 02:25:16,360
Does that person...

2222
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:18,329
That person had...

2223
02:25:18,329 --> 02:25:20,409
Wow, how did you do that?

2224
02:25:20,409 --> 02:25:21,610
How did you do that?

2225
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:26,629
You have to have like eight arms with like three different mice to do what he just did.

2226
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:32,469
He has like four keyboards.

2227
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:42,229
Watch out for the archer.

2228
02:25:42,229 --> 02:25:52,309
Okay, good.

2229
02:25:52,309 --> 02:25:52,790
Charge.

2230
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:55,340
I need health.

2231
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:56,139
Okay.

2232
02:25:56,139 --> 02:25:56,780
Okay.

2233
02:25:56,780 --> 02:25:57,659
All right.

2234
02:25:57,659 --> 02:25:57,979
Okay.

2235
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:09,780
I just got sacked.

2236
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:13,700
I'm the fucking quarterback and the guy just sacked me.

2237
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:14,020
What?

2238
02:26:14,739 --> 02:26:29,959
A meltdown stream.

2239
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,600
No, I just hiked the ball.

2240
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:34,360
It was 10 defensive linemen there.

2241
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:35,479
Offensive linemen.

2242
02:26:35,479 --> 02:26:37,239
And he got through them and he sacked me.

2243
02:26:37,239 --> 02:26:40,200
All right, I want to do a different game mode.

2244
02:26:48,809 --> 02:26:49,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

2245
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:50,569
Yeah, I want to make a class.

2246
02:26:57,459 --> 02:27:00,899
Room temperature IQ rants about game mechanics.

2247
02:27:00,899 --> 02:27:06,180
That was a 500 ping server.

2248
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:09,059
I'm not going to let that hurt me because no fucking way.

2249
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:21,319
I can't believe it.

2250
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:24,280
You have it like people jumping in front of you and killing you.

2251
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,760
You jump up to 650 ping.

2252
02:27:27,559 --> 02:27:30,200
Now, you just got a room temperature IQ.

2253
02:27:32,739 --> 02:27:33,860
Out of here with that.

2254
02:27:35,879 --> 02:27:37,399
I can hear that.

2255
02:27:37,399 --> 02:27:47,510
Whatever.

2256
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:47,989
I don't care.

2257
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:53,340
One point.

2258
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:54,459
Okay, it's 16 points.

2259
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:04,020
IQ test stream.

2260
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:05,139
No, I'm just fucking around.

2261
02:28:05,139 --> 02:28:06,100
I'm not mad.

2262
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:06,979
I'm just fucking around.

2263
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:11,879
I can't unlock this?

2264
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:13,879
Why?

2265
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:24,010
Two points.

2266
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:27,719
Don't I have 16 points?

2267
02:28:27,719 --> 02:28:29,079
I don't have it unlocked.

2268
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:32,899
Oh, okay.

2269
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:36,219
So I don't have anything unlocked.

2270
02:28:36,219 --> 02:28:40,549
So I can't make a custom class unless I do nothing.

2271
02:28:40,549 --> 02:28:40,950
Fists.

2272
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,299
Restart the game.

2273
02:28:48,299 --> 02:28:52,489
Okay, try that.

2274
02:28:56,809 --> 02:28:57,770
Mortal.

2275
02:28:57,770 --> 02:29:02,569
Let's try it again.

2276
02:29:02,569 --> 02:29:06,170
I'm sorry.

2277
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,729
That was a lot.

2278
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:15,879
It was too easy.

2279
02:29:15,879 --> 02:29:17,159
What are you talking about?

2280
02:29:17,159 --> 02:29:19,459
What are you talking about?

2281
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:26,579
I already did that too.

2282
02:29:26,579 --> 02:29:27,780
That's unfortunate.

2283
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:28,819
All right, can I?

2284
02:29:28,819 --> 02:29:29,620
No, can I?

2285
02:29:35,350 --> 02:29:36,709
There we go.

2286
02:29:36,709 --> 02:29:37,110
Okay.

2287
02:29:38,569 --> 02:29:40,090
500 gold to buy.

2288
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:43,059
How much money do I have?

2289
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:44,819
1120.

2290
02:29:45,459 --> 02:29:50,540
300 for a dagger.

2291
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:51,739
Wooden mallet cleaver.

2292
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:54,069
Primary.

2293
02:29:54,069 --> 02:29:55,510
Training sword.

2294
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:55,909
Really?

2295
02:29:55,909 --> 02:29:57,350
You can use a wooden sword?

2296
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,139
Quarter staff.

2297
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:03,989
Arming sword.

2298
02:30:03,989 --> 02:30:05,670
Damage, speed, and reach.

2299
02:30:05,670 --> 02:30:06,629
I think I want this thing.

2300
02:30:07,270 --> 02:30:11,850
A little one-handed little...

2301
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:22,139
I'm getting it.

2302
02:30:22,139 --> 02:30:22,860
Arming sword.

2303
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:25,479
Secondary.

2304
02:30:25,479 --> 02:30:26,040
I want...

2305
02:30:28,329 --> 02:30:30,250
Oh, there's actually a lot of stuff here.

2306
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:37,399
Wow.

2307
02:30:37,399 --> 02:30:38,120
Long sword?

2308
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:38,680
No.

2309
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:39,799
I had something small.

2310
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:44,709
I need like a little secondary.

2311
02:30:46,489 --> 02:30:47,370
One two-handed.

2312
02:30:47,370 --> 02:30:48,489
One-handed shield.

2313
02:30:48,489 --> 02:30:48,729
Shield.

2314
02:30:48,729 --> 02:30:49,770
Maybe I should get a little shield.

2315
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:51,799
A little targe.

2316
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:55,430
I think I'm gonna get this.

2317
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:05,579
And then a tertiary.

2318
02:31:07,379 --> 02:31:07,940
Bandage.

2319
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:08,579
Quarter staff.

2320
02:31:08,579 --> 02:31:09,379
Training sword.

2321
02:31:09,379 --> 02:31:09,940
Fire bomb.

2322
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:10,979
Maybe I should get the fire bombs.

2323
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:13,459
Get the loot.

2324
02:31:13,459 --> 02:31:13,780
Rock.

2325
02:31:16,149 --> 02:31:17,510
I don't need to see anything else.

2326
02:31:17,510 --> 02:31:19,100
Okay.

2327
02:31:20,059 --> 02:31:20,459
Body.

2328
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:21,420
Fat.

2329
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:27,190
Okay.

2330
02:31:28,229 --> 02:31:29,399
Armor.

2331
02:31:29,959 --> 02:31:31,190
I don't have any more money.

2332
02:31:37,819 --> 02:31:39,579
I could make myself look like a total dickhead.

2333
02:31:39,579 --> 02:31:40,620
That's what I'm going for here.

2334
02:31:43,319 --> 02:31:44,920
I can't get anything else.

2335
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:45,319
All right.

2336
02:31:45,319 --> 02:31:46,040
Shoulders?

2337
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:46,280
No.

2338
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:49,260
I have not enough money.

2339
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:49,579
All right.

2340
02:31:49,579 --> 02:31:52,379
So then body, face, and voice.

2341
02:32:00,139 --> 02:32:00,540
Perfect.

2342
02:32:17,819 --> 02:32:19,739
This is just Geralt.

2343
02:32:19,739 --> 02:32:20,139
Whatever.

2344
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:21,829
Facial hair.

2345
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,670
All right.

2346
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:33,159
So this is...

2347
02:32:33,879 --> 02:32:34,299
What?

2348
02:32:34,299 --> 02:32:35,020
You can...

2349
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:36,379
I can actually do this?

2350
02:32:36,379 --> 02:32:36,860
Holy shit.

2351
02:32:36,860 --> 02:32:37,340
Wait a minute.

2352
02:32:53,819 --> 02:32:56,459
Guess it's not that big of a deal.

2353
02:32:56,459 --> 02:32:57,899
It's not that huge.

2354
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:04,969
Five hours in.

2355
02:33:04,969 --> 02:33:06,090
We're at the character creator.

2356
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:16,440
Okay.

2357
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:19,049
That's fine.

2358
02:33:19,049 --> 02:33:20,649
So we have you.

2359
02:33:20,649 --> 02:33:22,489
I need to edit you.

2360
02:33:22,489 --> 02:33:26,469
We need to do skills, right?

2361
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:27,270
Where's the skills?

2362
02:33:27,909 --> 02:33:31,899
And they're like perks there up here.

2363
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:33,260
All right.

2364
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:36,299
So a friendly fire reduction.

2365
02:33:37,159 --> 02:33:38,600
Absolutely.

2366
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:41,530
Extra stamina on hit.

2367
02:33:41,530 --> 02:33:44,649
Full health on melee kills.

2368
02:33:44,649 --> 02:33:47,559
And reduces fire damage by 80%

2369
02:33:47,559 --> 02:33:49,079
because I walk in it all the time.

2370
02:33:49,079 --> 02:33:50,969
I think they're ready.

2371
02:33:50,969 --> 02:33:55,129
There's better armor for free.

2372
02:33:57,479 --> 02:33:58,120
Oh.

2373
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:01,909
There is.

2374
02:34:02,469 --> 02:34:09,139
But it costs one point.

2375
02:34:09,139 --> 02:34:11,639
I think it's all right for now.

2376
02:34:11,639 --> 02:34:13,159
There's more free armor.

2377
02:34:13,159 --> 02:34:13,799
Chainmail.

2378
02:34:13,799 --> 02:34:14,520
Oh.

2379
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,930
What level am I?

2380
02:34:16,569 --> 02:34:16,809
Two.

2381
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:19,530
I can do chainmail, but it's two points.

2382
02:34:19,530 --> 02:34:20,729
So that means I have to remove...

2383
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:22,809
These are very important

2384
02:34:22,809 --> 02:34:23,930
because I'm fucking terrible.

2385
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:29,459
You're wearing a hospital gown.

2386
02:34:30,579 --> 02:34:35,719
All right.

2387
02:34:35,719 --> 02:34:44,149
I'll get it.

2388
02:34:44,149 --> 02:34:44,790
Metal tint?

2389
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:46,840
Oh, that's cool.

2390
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:54,379
Hospital gown.

2391
02:34:58,579 --> 02:34:58,899
Okay.

2392
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:00,469
Let me see.

2393
02:35:00,469 --> 02:35:02,229
That's all I can do.

2394
02:35:02,229 --> 02:35:02,790
Chainmail.

2395
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:03,030
Legs.

2396
02:35:03,030 --> 02:35:03,989
I don't need them.

2397
02:35:03,989 --> 02:35:06,059
I'm ready to fight.

2398
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:08,520
Fight.

2399
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:11,940
Should I do battle royale again?

2400
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:12,899
Try BR again?

2401
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:18,739
Horde mode.

2402
02:35:18,739 --> 02:35:19,059
Let's try.

2403
02:35:19,059 --> 02:35:22,840
I'm gonna try BR again.

2404
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:23,239
I know.

2405
02:35:23,239 --> 02:35:23,479
I know.

2406
02:35:23,479 --> 02:35:23,799
I know.

2407
02:35:23,799 --> 02:35:25,719
I don't want to watch you do battle royale.

2408
02:35:25,719 --> 02:35:26,760
You fucking wanker.

2409
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:29,020
You fucking wanker.

2410
02:35:30,739 --> 02:35:31,139
Relax.

2411
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:42,059
What is horde mode?

2412
02:35:42,059 --> 02:35:42,700
Oh.

2413
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:45,239
It's probably just survival.

2414
02:35:48,299 --> 02:35:49,899
I think you're the one that needs to relax.

2415
02:35:52,709 --> 02:35:53,430
No, I'm fine.

2416
02:35:54,229 --> 02:35:54,870
You relax.

2417
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:57,940
How about we all collectively relax at the same time?

2418
02:35:58,500 --> 02:36:04,139
See?

2419
02:36:04,139 --> 02:36:04,940
Don't you feel better?

2420
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:11,719
You fucking relax.

2421
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:14,969
And no, you relax.

2422
02:36:14,969 --> 02:36:15,850
Yeah, you relax.

2423
02:36:16,569 --> 02:36:18,809
Check my emails while we hang out here.

2424
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,959
I'm just gonna read you the first email that I have in my inbox.

2425
02:36:28,219 --> 02:36:29,500
It's from JetBlue.

2426
02:36:29,500 --> 02:36:37,819
It's talking about how there's sale right now for airfare, I guess.

2427
02:36:37,819 --> 02:36:40,979
Interestingly enough, this is just my first email.

2428
02:36:40,979 --> 02:36:41,620
Okay.

2429
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:44,709
I'm not kidding around.

2430
02:36:44,709 --> 02:36:46,149
First email, almost.

2431
02:36:46,149 --> 02:36:49,239
You still use email, but you don't have an email?

2432
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:51,319
How do you not have an email?

2433
02:36:52,569 --> 02:36:55,690
How do you get a bunch of stuff you don't want to open, a bunch of trash?

2434
02:36:55,690 --> 02:37:01,819
How do you go to a retail store and give them your email so they leave you alone?

2435
02:37:09,979 --> 02:37:11,260
You want to sign up for rewards?

2436
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:11,500
Sure.

2437
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:11,979
Who cares?

2438
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:26,649
Guys, I have like, I'm pretty sure I have like 44,000 unread emails.

2439
02:37:37,639 --> 02:37:44,379
And I would say probably 80 to 90% of them are like coupons from Whole Foods.

2440
02:37:50,229 --> 02:37:51,110
Overhead swing.

2441
02:37:51,670 --> 02:37:56,020
Ooh, a little jab.

2442
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:59,129
I didn't think I was gonna do that.

2443
02:37:59,129 --> 02:38:03,780
Who's next?

2444
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:04,899
That was mine.

2445
02:38:04,899 --> 02:38:16,600
Did you sign up for the stupid rewards programs?

2446
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:21,989
Yeah, but jokes on them.

2447
02:38:21,989 --> 02:38:23,989
I don't even open the email account.

2448
02:38:23,989 --> 02:38:26,860
You know, jokes on them.

2449
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:30,780
They probably go to their email and they see that I haven't opened it.

2450
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:33,940
This guy won't open anything.

2451
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:34,659
What the fuck?

2452
02:38:35,299 --> 02:38:37,780
Because don't open it because then they'll know.

2453
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:40,340
Their little read receipts will be on.

2454
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:49,659
What am I doing?

2455
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:03,290
Um, can I, can I run?

2456
02:39:03,930 --> 02:39:06,260
Is he dead?

2457
02:39:07,989 --> 02:39:09,909
No, stop rubber banding me around.

2458
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,600
That's a loud and scary noise.

2459
02:39:15,719 --> 02:39:27,209
Well, I got on a horse and punched somebody and then I ran in place for five seconds.

2460
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:43,139
That was a rage quit?

2461
02:39:43,139 --> 02:39:43,540
No, it wasn't.

2462
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:44,579
I got kicked out.

2463
02:39:45,139 --> 02:39:47,459
All right, try this one more time.

2464
02:39:59,590 --> 02:40:00,629
VR sucks.

2465
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:04,040
Yeah, but that's, come on.

2466
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:05,159
That's going to get me the views.

2467
02:40:05,879 --> 02:40:18,420
I would turn my webcam on and show you.

2468
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:29,930
I was going to get me the fucking views, but dude, I have no clothes on.

2469
02:40:29,930 --> 02:40:34,329
All right, here we go.

2470
02:40:35,829 --> 02:40:37,510
I'm going to actually give it an attempt this time.

2471
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:41,770
No face cam, no views.

2472
02:40:42,489 --> 02:40:46,709
Do I have arrows?

2473
02:40:46,709 --> 02:40:54,020
Oh shit, he has the same thing.

2474
02:40:54,659 --> 02:40:59,719
Got plenty of arrows.

2475
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:02,500
Someone's going to drop down around behind me or something.

2476
02:41:03,219 --> 02:41:04,020
I hear somebody.

2477
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:05,139
All right, I gotta move.

2478
02:41:05,139 --> 02:41:10,409
Got a crossbow as well.

2479
02:41:10,409 --> 02:41:11,610
I've never even used the crossbow.

2480
02:41:12,329 --> 02:41:12,889
Is it good?

2481
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:20,819
Huh?

2482
02:41:20,819 --> 02:41:23,510
That's such a scary fucking noise.

2483
02:41:23,510 --> 02:41:26,459
They need to turn that down.

2484
02:41:26,459 --> 02:41:28,620
I think that's an arrow hitting right next to my head.

2485
02:41:35,479 --> 02:41:36,680
Okay, I gotta go back to the bow.

2486
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:53,819
No, what the fuck?

2487
02:41:53,819 --> 02:41:54,700
Battle Royale.

2488
02:41:56,069 --> 02:42:06,299
You watch another streamer do it.

2489
02:42:06,299 --> 02:42:07,659
They won't be hard to find.

2490
02:42:07,659 --> 02:42:08,299
Trust me.

2491
02:42:08,299 --> 02:42:18,389
Did I just have somebody coming back?

2492
02:42:18,389 --> 02:42:18,870
Hey, dude.

2493
02:42:19,989 --> 02:42:21,989
I knew you said I could go find another Battle Royale stream.

2494
02:42:21,989 --> 02:42:23,270
I couldn't find one.

2495
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:25,100
I searched.

2496
02:42:25,100 --> 02:42:27,100
I was down on the browse and the category list.

2497
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:28,940
I didn't find anyone playing Battle Royale.

2498
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:32,020
Are you sure?

2499
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,540
Maybe that you were just speaking out of tone there.

2500
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:40,950
That's what I would do if I was like a troll in chat right now.

2501
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:42,709
I'd be like, hey, dude, I couldn't find anybody playing VR.

2502
02:42:42,709 --> 02:42:43,350
Could you play it again?

2503
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:07,510
What's Battle Royale?

2504
02:43:28,299 --> 02:43:30,700
Just the word Royale makes me sad.

2505
02:43:31,819 --> 02:43:36,540
It shouldn't.

2506
02:43:36,540 --> 02:43:56,120
I don't think anyone's playing this mode.

2507
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:58,760
Well, all right, let's try the actual browser.

2508
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:00,120
Oh my god, what happened?

2509
02:44:07,299 --> 02:44:09,059
I think it started.

2510
02:44:18,139 --> 02:44:19,500
Check your emails in the meantime.

2511
02:44:20,219 --> 02:44:29,379
All right.

2512
02:44:29,379 --> 02:44:31,059
Arming sword at 60.

2513
02:44:31,860 --> 02:44:32,739
Oh, I see.

2514
02:44:32,739 --> 02:44:39,139
This is cool.

2515
02:44:39,139 --> 02:44:40,020
Bandage.

2516
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:46,979
Maybe she got a bandage.

2517
02:44:46,979 --> 02:44:48,020
Wave one.

2518
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:50,629
How easy is it to kill things?

2519
02:44:50,629 --> 02:44:53,780
How did you get a knife?

2520
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:02,389
Where do they pour?

2521
02:45:02,389 --> 02:45:11,479
Is it just default enemies that you have to kill?

2522
02:45:11,479 --> 02:45:13,639
No, we're just playing Cod Zombies now.

2523
02:45:13,639 --> 02:45:14,120
Kind of.

2524
02:45:15,750 --> 02:45:18,520
I see them.

2525
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:19,799
Don't go too far.

2526
02:45:19,799 --> 02:45:23,590
Don't go too far.

2527
02:45:24,149 --> 02:45:28,889
Is that an enemy?

2528
02:45:34,010 --> 02:45:34,489
Are we just?

2529
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:27,209
All right.

2530
02:46:27,209 --> 02:46:28,649
Where are the enemies?

2531
02:46:28,649 --> 02:46:37,700
Do we have to go looking for them?

2532
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:48,469
Are they just scattered around?

2533
02:46:48,469 --> 02:46:50,870
They don't like come in the same place, it seems.

2534
02:46:50,870 --> 02:47:01,399
The rock killed stinky rat.

2535
02:47:01,399 --> 02:47:02,600
Oh, they got in.

2536
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:03,799
They got in.

2537
02:47:03,799 --> 02:47:05,559
The farmers got in.

2538
02:47:05,559 --> 02:47:09,930
This is great.

2539
02:47:09,930 --> 02:47:10,569
God.

2540
02:47:10,569 --> 02:47:17,159
Can I get his weapon?

2541
02:47:17,159 --> 02:47:32,739
All right, we did it.

2542
02:47:32,739 --> 02:47:33,379
How much money we got?

2543
02:47:33,379 --> 02:47:33,860
34.

2544
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:34,899
All right, give me a weapon.

2545
02:47:34,899 --> 02:47:41,770
This side is 90.

2546
02:47:41,770 --> 02:47:46,889
Damn it.

2547
02:47:46,889 --> 02:47:50,409
Light legs, bandage, light helmet.

2548
02:47:50,409 --> 02:47:52,090
No, I need a sword.

2549
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:56,360
God damn it.

2550
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:57,479
Where's their weapon?

2551
02:47:57,479 --> 02:47:57,879
Over here.

2552
02:48:00,659 --> 02:48:02,659
Ammo, toolbox, chest.

2553
02:48:02,659 --> 02:48:05,799
This one's 50.

2554
02:48:05,799 --> 02:48:09,110
What about inside here?

2555
02:48:11,459 --> 02:48:12,100
Bear trap?

2556
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:12,340
No.

2557
02:48:18,739 --> 02:48:21,209
I'm not picking up any of that.

2558
02:48:21,209 --> 02:48:21,930
Buy a sword?

2559
02:48:21,930 --> 02:48:25,510
Yeah, I mean, I bought a rock.

2560
02:48:31,590 --> 02:48:32,389
Rusty fork.

2561
02:48:32,389 --> 02:48:33,510
I really don't have enough.

2562
02:48:34,889 --> 02:48:35,770
Rock OP.

2563
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:37,930
Yeah, I'm just going to hit people in the face of the rock.

2564
02:48:37,930 --> 02:48:41,989
Do I have to throw it?

2565
02:48:41,989 --> 02:48:43,110
Does it throw?

2566
02:48:43,110 --> 02:48:43,750
Yeah, it does.

2567
02:48:49,879 --> 02:48:50,520
Got him.

2568
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:53,799
We got two more.

2569
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:58,379
Fuck.

2570
02:48:58,379 --> 02:49:00,379
Oh, that somehow got me.

2571
02:49:00,379 --> 02:49:00,940
I got a rock.

2572
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:01,739
I'm dead.

2573
02:49:01,739 --> 02:49:03,100
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

2574
02:49:10,059 --> 02:49:11,739
What, he got me with the backswing?

2575
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,440
He went all the way back?

2576
02:49:30,389 --> 02:49:31,270
Buy a sword?

2577
02:49:31,270 --> 02:49:31,670
I don't know.

2578
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:32,790
I don't even know where they are.

2579
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:36,389
Where are the weapons?

2580
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:41,719
They're just randomly kind of scattered out.

2581
02:49:41,719 --> 02:49:44,200
There's like a dagger over here in this tent.

2582
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:46,520
There's a bear trap in there.

2583
02:49:47,780 --> 02:49:49,540
Nothing in there as chests over here.

2584
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:51,750
Rock at the fire.

2585
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:59,750
All right, I'm going to go in here and get the dagger.

2586
02:49:59,750 --> 02:50:27,610
It's near the spawn.

2587
02:50:28,489 --> 02:50:31,190
So like back here.

2588
02:50:41,299 --> 02:50:42,659
Ye olde no sword.

2589
02:50:42,659 --> 02:50:43,379
Well, here they are.

2590
02:50:44,739 --> 02:50:45,700
I can't afford them.

2591
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:47,930
There's those two.

2592
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:57,739
Where's that dagger?

2593
02:50:57,739 --> 02:50:59,020
I can get a chest.

2594
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:00,899
Is it worth getting a chest?

2595
02:51:00,899 --> 02:51:02,649
I'm going to try it.

2596
02:51:02,649 --> 02:51:07,780
Oh, nice.

2597
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:10,700
I got something to peel fucking apples with.

2598
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:19,959
Anybody need a potato peel?

2599
02:51:19,959 --> 02:51:21,399
Well, that's what I can do with this.

2600
02:51:21,399 --> 02:51:32,860
Just throw it into the darkness.

2601
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:36,090
This thing is so tiny.

2602
02:51:36,090 --> 02:51:37,610
How am I going to kill anybody with this?

2603
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:01,860
What?

2604
02:52:01,860 --> 02:52:03,620
Oh, get away from me, please.

2605
02:52:14,569 --> 02:52:15,450
Oh my goodness.

2606
02:52:25,020 --> 02:52:26,219
Well, I didn't do the worst.

2607
02:52:34,709 --> 02:52:37,399
Uh, I want to play the actual game.

2608
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:48,870
I want to play the actual video game against other players.

2609
02:52:52,549 --> 02:52:53,430
It's BR.

2610
02:52:53,430 --> 02:52:54,389
No, it's not.

2611
02:52:54,389 --> 02:52:58,540
All right, I'm going for it.

2612
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:06,520
Out of 64.

2613
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:07,079
There we go.

2614
02:53:10,459 --> 02:53:11,020
What is this?

2615
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:11,739
Game mode?

2616
02:53:11,739 --> 02:53:21,319
Is this protector?

2617
02:53:21,319 --> 02:53:31,450
Do I have to wait till another game starts?

2618
02:53:32,010 --> 02:53:36,379
How much is the game?

2619
02:53:36,379 --> 02:53:40,600
It's like 26, 27 right now, right?

2620
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:42,520
Oh, it's only one life per round.

2621
02:53:42,520 --> 02:53:42,840
Damn.

2622
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:44,700
All right.

2623
02:53:44,700 --> 02:53:45,659
How did that guy?

2624
02:53:45,659 --> 02:53:49,100
That guy fell off and grabbed the ledge and didn't fall.

2625
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:51,260
That was incredible.

2626
02:53:51,260 --> 02:53:59,989
It's like red has the upper hand.

2627
02:53:59,989 --> 02:54:03,530
Not really though.

2628
02:54:03,530 --> 02:54:04,569
Turn around.

2629
02:54:04,569 --> 02:54:05,850
Everybody has tunnel vision.

2630
02:54:05,850 --> 02:54:07,690
It's so easy to get tunnel vision in this game.

2631
02:54:07,690 --> 02:54:15,379
It seriously is.

2632
02:54:15,379 --> 02:54:21,799
No, you're dead.

2633
02:54:21,799 --> 02:54:23,479
All right, here we go.

2634
02:54:23,479 --> 02:54:25,159
Let's see how long I can last.

2635
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:55,770
Watch out to your side.

2636
02:54:55,770 --> 02:55:10,729
Protector, get behind me.

2637
02:55:10,729 --> 02:55:21,180
Behind.

2638
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:23,559
Nuh-uh.

2639
02:55:23,559 --> 02:55:29,459
Oh, that's what we call a double kill.

2640
02:55:29,459 --> 02:55:32,120
It's when you kill two people at the same time.

2641
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:33,479
And I don't know if you've ever heard it before.

2642
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:42,979
I have a little bit.

2643
02:55:42,979 --> 02:55:43,459
Oh, fuck.

2644
02:55:43,459 --> 02:55:43,780
Oh, fuck.

2645
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:44,100
Oh, fuck.

2646
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:44,739
Oh, fuck.

2647
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:54,489
Oh, I was the only one left.

2648
02:55:54,489 --> 02:55:56,170
I would say it was 1 v 10.

2649
02:55:58,170 --> 02:55:59,209
That was ridiculous.

2650
02:55:59,209 --> 02:56:02,010
I thought tunnel vision, 2.0.

2651
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:07,129
I didn't even know I was the last person left.

2652
02:56:07,129 --> 02:56:08,569
Oh, I thought I could catch him.

2653
02:56:08,569 --> 02:56:15,209
Let's fuck the whole thing up.

2654
02:56:15,209 --> 02:56:16,170
Watch this.

2655
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:28,299
No.

2656
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:41,559
Yeah, not a fall joke.

2657
02:56:41,559 --> 02:56:42,840
It was actually fall.

2658
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:44,200
Fucking god damn it.

2659
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:44,760
No.

2660
02:56:44,760 --> 02:56:45,639
Why?

2661
02:56:45,639 --> 02:56:59,819
It's called disorienting.

2662
02:57:00,379 --> 02:57:03,420
Okay, blue team is so much better.

2663
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:07,700
I don't think anybody on blue team died.

2664
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:08,659
That's not fair.

2665
02:57:08,659 --> 02:57:11,620
You can't put the NFL team against the Pee Wee team.

2666
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:13,860
What are you proving here?

2667
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:19,590
What if you're gonna get two yards?

2668
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:21,670
That's another football reference if you're counting.

2669
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:22,469
It's been at least two.

2670
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:33,139
Fuck, I'm dead.

2671
02:57:33,700 --> 02:57:35,139
I'm just getting fucking rolled.

2672
02:57:35,780 --> 02:57:50,309
Stay alive.

2673
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:50,870
You can do it.

2674
02:57:51,350 --> 02:58:00,979
How many are left?

2675
02:58:00,979 --> 02:58:01,299
Come on.

2676
02:58:01,299 --> 02:58:02,420
There's only this.

2677
02:58:02,420 --> 02:58:05,739
I know you can do it.

2678
02:58:05,739 --> 02:58:06,940
My pregnant.

2679
02:58:06,940 --> 02:58:08,299
My girlfriend pregnant.

2680
02:58:08,940 --> 02:58:09,659
You can do it.

2681
02:58:09,659 --> 02:58:10,459
Get him.

2682
02:58:10,459 --> 02:58:11,579
Come out of AFT.

2683
02:58:11,579 --> 02:58:12,299
That's too bad.

2684
02:58:13,299 --> 02:58:13,940
That's too bad.

2685
02:58:14,579 --> 02:58:16,729
There was an opportunity there.

2686
02:58:16,729 --> 02:58:23,899
We're getting so badly beat.

2687
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:30,649
All right.

2688
02:58:30,649 --> 02:58:32,180
I gotta step it up here.

2689
02:58:32,180 --> 02:58:33,139
Come on.

2690
02:58:33,139 --> 02:58:34,950
Step it up.

2691
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:36,229
Red team blows.

2692
02:58:36,229 --> 02:58:37,350
Hey, don't say that.

2693
02:58:47,559 --> 02:58:47,959
Good.

2694
02:58:47,959 --> 02:58:48,600
Good.

2695
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:50,700
Push him back.

2696
02:59:03,799 --> 02:59:05,319
Just fucking killed it.

2697
02:59:11,639 --> 02:59:12,680
It's too much.

2698
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:14,600
When we're getting beat this bad.

2699
02:59:16,649 --> 02:59:17,930
There's bound to be some cows.

2700
02:59:17,930 --> 02:59:19,209
I gotta change class.

2701
02:59:19,209 --> 02:59:21,450
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go Raider.

2702
02:59:24,139 --> 02:59:27,500
He pushed him into me and I hit him right in the face with a swing.

2703
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:30,459
But when we're losing this badly, there's only, look.

2704
02:59:30,940 --> 02:59:33,100
Oh, I thought that was the girlfriend guy.

2705
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:41,979
Are we gonna win?

2706
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:43,100
Holy shit.

2707
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:43,659
How did they?

2708
02:59:43,659 --> 02:59:44,940
Were they just sitting in the back?

2709
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:46,299
How did you guys pull this off?

2710
02:59:47,100 --> 02:59:52,120
I can't believe we just won.

2711
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:55,239
Wasn't there just a bunch of blue and not a bunch of red?

2712
02:59:55,959 --> 02:59:59,319
Is the strategy to be AFK?

2713
03:00:00,459 --> 03:00:01,020
Holy shit.

2714
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:01,739
We actually did it.

2715
03:00:05,930 --> 03:00:06,729
Nice job, guys.

2716
03:00:08,329 --> 03:00:09,930
I think somebody's stuck inside of me.

2717
03:00:11,190 --> 03:00:14,700
Yeah, don't please.

2718
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:20,409
Just don't shoot me.

2719
03:00:21,879 --> 03:00:22,760
Don't shoot me, dude.

2720
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:25,129
Just he's trying to shoot me.

2721
03:00:32,629 --> 03:00:34,309
How did this even happen?

2722
03:00:34,309 --> 03:00:42,329
Somebody just killed one of us.

2723
03:00:42,889 --> 03:00:44,329
Just turn around and kill us, please.

2724
03:00:49,899 --> 03:00:50,219
Okay.

2725
03:00:53,930 --> 03:00:54,329
I don't know.

2726
03:00:55,299 --> 03:00:56,579
That guy wasn't even connected to us.

2727
03:01:05,049 --> 03:01:05,530
Got you.

2728
03:01:10,069 --> 03:01:11,670
Oh, that was an uppercut.

2729
03:01:11,670 --> 03:01:21,450
Got you.

2730
03:01:21,450 --> 03:01:24,219
I had a chance.

2731
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:29,750
Fuck.

2732
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:41,270
Changing maps.

2733
03:01:41,270 --> 03:01:42,309
This is kind of fun.

2734
03:01:42,309 --> 03:01:43,819
This is fun.

2735
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:51,670
I think the game is more addicting than chivalry.

2736
03:01:51,670 --> 03:01:59,530
Chivalry was a lot of fun.

2737
03:01:59,530 --> 03:02:02,809
All right, skirmish, team deathmatch.

2738
03:02:02,809 --> 03:02:04,250
Hold on, are we gonna do...

2739
03:02:04,329 --> 03:02:15,959
Does this mean it's 64 people or free-for-all?

2740
03:02:15,959 --> 03:02:16,600
No, okay.

2741
03:02:20,659 --> 03:02:23,530
Next day, Raider.

2742
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:27,079
This game is a mess in comparison.

2743
03:02:28,229 --> 03:02:29,430
It's kind of fun that way, though.

2744
03:02:29,989 --> 03:02:46,649
That would have been a clip

2745
03:02:47,290 --> 03:02:49,129
that somebody would have saved if any of those had landed.

2746
03:02:57,799 --> 03:02:59,159
Hitmarker sound, yeah.

2747
03:02:59,159 --> 03:03:00,280
Oh, watch out.

2748
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:12,020
Hello.

2749
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:13,399
Who is it?

2750
03:03:13,399 --> 03:03:17,049
I think I just got shot in the back by the guy with the...

2751
03:03:17,610 --> 03:03:23,750
I'm in trouble.

2752
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:24,709
There's so many here.

2753
03:03:24,709 --> 03:03:25,670
Oh, fuck.

2754
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:26,389
Oh, my God.

2755
03:03:27,350 --> 03:03:29,100
Was it bear trap?

2756
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:33,239
Oh, I thought I got shot from behind in the back of the head.

2757
03:03:33,879 --> 03:03:39,100
Am I a drumstick or am I a wingman?

2758
03:03:39,100 --> 03:03:39,579
Drumstick.

2759
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:43,909
Oh, my fucking God.

2760
03:03:43,909 --> 03:03:45,909
You're putting this here to death.

2761
03:03:45,909 --> 03:03:47,430
It was there as a prank.

2762
03:03:48,069 --> 03:03:49,750
I got pranked by my own team.

2763
03:03:49,750 --> 03:03:50,549
That's what that was.

2764
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:55,909
I've walked in...

2765
03:03:55,909 --> 03:03:57,270
Why is it in our spawn?

2766
03:03:57,989 --> 03:04:00,540
That's the question you should be asking.

2767
03:04:01,579 --> 03:04:04,059
Not did he walk in it, but why was it there?

2768
03:04:04,860 --> 03:04:06,840
You ever stub your toe on something?

2769
03:04:08,389 --> 03:04:10,549
You don't go, wow, he's literally blind.

2770
03:04:10,549 --> 03:04:13,260
Oh, my God.

2771
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:15,979
So if a friend of yours stubbed their toe on a sofa

2772
03:04:15,979 --> 03:04:18,620
that's been in the same room for five years,

2773
03:04:18,620 --> 03:04:19,579
how many times have you done that?

2774
03:04:20,219 --> 03:04:21,430
What, you didn't know there was a sofa there?

2775
03:04:21,430 --> 03:04:21,989
Were you blind?

2776
03:04:22,709 --> 03:04:25,430
No, sometimes you just stub your toe on shit.

2777
03:04:36,139 --> 03:04:37,260
I do say that.

2778
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:37,979
Well, you're mean.

2779
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,420
Don't be so mean.

2780
03:04:47,319 --> 03:04:48,120
What the fuck?

2781
03:04:53,879 --> 03:04:54,920
Oh, my God.

2782
03:04:57,879 --> 03:04:58,520
What?

2783
03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:00,600
How did none of those hit anyone?

2784
03:05:09,239 --> 03:05:12,340
Statistically speaking, one of those had to have hit.

2785
03:05:14,469 --> 03:05:15,670
It's impossible to miss that.

2786
03:05:17,260 --> 03:05:17,819
No, it's not.

2787
03:05:17,819 --> 03:05:18,700
Never mind.

2788
03:05:18,700 --> 03:05:35,879
I was trying to parry it.

2789
03:05:46,149 --> 03:05:46,870
Easy.

2790
03:05:46,870 --> 03:05:51,479
I had to be right there.

2791
03:06:03,670 --> 03:06:04,870
Let's go up over the mountain.

2792
03:06:05,430 --> 03:06:09,159
Let's do a mountain run, first of all.

2793
03:06:10,120 --> 03:06:34,860
Second of all, it's really like playing the lottery

2794
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:35,579
when you do that.

2795
03:06:35,579 --> 03:06:36,860
If you hit, it's fucking huge.

2796
03:06:36,860 --> 03:06:38,059
It's like a million dollars.

2797
03:06:38,059 --> 03:06:48,329
Okay, don't get stuck on the stairs here.

2798
03:06:48,889 --> 03:07:01,739
Damn it.

2799
03:07:01,739 --> 03:07:02,459
Oh, this is bad.

2800
03:07:10,950 --> 03:07:12,870
How many Mordhau montages are we going to get?

2801
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:14,389
Depends on how good people are.

2802
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:20,760
You got to get play by play.

2803
03:07:20,760 --> 03:07:21,879
I can't get play by play

2804
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:25,079
because then I'll lose over and over again.

2805
03:07:39,530 --> 03:07:41,690
He came all the way back to the spawn.

2806
03:07:45,659 --> 03:07:45,899
Where?

2807
03:07:46,780 --> 03:07:47,579
He's still here.

2808
03:07:48,620 --> 03:07:49,899
I'm getting on the fucking horse.

2809
03:07:51,239 --> 03:07:52,200
Oh, my God.

2810
03:08:02,809 --> 03:08:04,170
That guy was reading the map.

2811
03:08:05,030 --> 03:08:06,069
Oh, my goodness.

2812
03:08:18,090 --> 03:08:19,530
That was a very quick match.

2813
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:30,760
All right, I'm going to be my guy.

2814
03:08:37,659 --> 03:08:39,819
Stop team killing, you idiots.

2815
03:08:39,819 --> 03:08:45,459
I think I'll be all right with this.

2816
03:08:45,459 --> 03:08:46,100
I got rocks.

2817
03:08:51,290 --> 03:08:54,500
Okay, this is going to be the run.

2818
03:08:54,500 --> 03:08:56,819
This will be the round where I'm at least in the top five.

2819
03:08:56,819 --> 03:08:58,340
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

2820
03:08:58,340 --> 03:09:00,739
I'm seriously going to put everything into this.

2821
03:09:01,379 --> 03:09:04,659
Here we go.

2822
03:09:06,979 --> 03:09:10,950
That's a cool hammer.

2823
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:37,719
This is the enemy spawn.

2824
03:09:41,879 --> 03:09:45,770
You can't go down in the enemy spawn.

2825
03:09:45,770 --> 03:09:46,090
Why?

2826
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:49,879
It just kills you.

2827
03:09:51,799 --> 03:10:07,399
I love it.

2828
03:10:07,399 --> 03:10:13,819
He's dead.

2829
03:10:16,819 --> 03:10:18,260
I have an axe in me.

2830
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:20,020
I just took the axe out of my body.

2831
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:39,739
Oh, he killed me.

2832
03:10:41,459 --> 03:10:43,219
I got a little too close to the teammate there.

2833
03:10:43,219 --> 03:10:45,219
He just kind of elbowed me in the mouth.

2834
03:10:45,860 --> 03:10:59,209
It wasn't my fault.

2835
03:11:00,790 --> 03:11:02,790
People are going to say it was, but it was not.

2836
03:11:02,790 --> 03:11:20,549
The head.

2837
03:11:20,549 --> 03:11:28,629
Right in the window.

2838
03:11:28,629 --> 03:11:32,090
Coming up.

2839
03:11:32,090 --> 03:11:33,209
I'm going to kick him right in the face.

2840
03:11:33,209 --> 03:11:34,010
Whoever comes up here.

2841
03:11:34,569 --> 03:11:36,729
Easy.

2842
03:11:36,729 --> 03:11:37,209
Wait, wait, wait.

2843
03:11:37,209 --> 03:11:38,250
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

2844
03:11:38,250 --> 03:11:38,569
Wait, wait, wait.

2845
03:11:38,569 --> 03:11:39,959
Don't go up there.

2846
03:11:39,959 --> 03:11:42,280
Wait for them to come up and we can helms deep them.

2847
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:44,200
Then you see helms deep.

2848
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:45,959
Then you see them when we lord of the rings.

2849
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:47,159
Turn around.

2850
03:11:47,159 --> 03:11:48,040
You're going to get sniped.

2851
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:49,319
Turn around.

2852
03:11:49,319 --> 03:11:50,520
He's coming up there right now.

2853
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:51,000
Look.

2854
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,280
We're going to helms deep this guy.

2855
03:12:08,180 --> 03:12:10,889
I told you.

2856
03:12:10,889 --> 03:12:11,850
Did you see the movie?

2857
03:12:28,360 --> 03:12:29,319
I told you.

2858
03:12:29,319 --> 03:12:30,760
You got to watch out for that shit.

2859
03:12:31,399 --> 03:12:32,280
They ain't fucking around.

2860
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:33,959
They really want to get up this ladder.

2861
03:12:33,959 --> 03:12:37,059
Can I throw this sword back at them?

2862
03:12:37,059 --> 03:12:37,459
Who's that?

2863
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:41,860
Oh, they're coming in the other side.

2864
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:42,819
I told you.

2865
03:12:42,819 --> 03:12:44,309
Apparently I told you.

2866
03:12:44,309 --> 03:12:44,870
I told you.

2867
03:12:44,870 --> 03:12:45,270
I told you.

2868
03:12:45,270 --> 03:12:45,750
I told you.

2869
03:12:46,309 --> 03:12:55,559
Watch the back.

2870
03:12:55,559 --> 03:12:55,799
Watch it.

2871
03:12:55,799 --> 03:12:56,600
They're going to climb up the ladder.

2872
03:12:56,600 --> 03:12:57,159
Helms deep.

2873
03:12:57,159 --> 03:12:57,959
I told you guys.

2874
03:12:58,520 --> 03:13:02,489
You act like you've never seen any of these movies.

2875
03:13:03,049 --> 03:13:19,940
I'm going to start spamming voice chat as close to the mic as I can get.

2876
03:13:20,659 --> 03:13:30,329
Well, that didn't do anything.

2877
03:13:30,329 --> 03:13:32,889
I still don't have the drop down on how hard those rocks get thrown.

2878
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:37,739
Watch out.

2879
03:13:37,739 --> 03:13:38,540
Don't backswing me.

2880
03:13:39,100 --> 03:13:40,299
I just back.

2881
03:13:40,299 --> 03:13:40,620
Okay.

2882
03:13:40,620 --> 03:13:41,739
Well, I did what he...

2883
03:13:43,700 --> 03:13:44,739
It's too chaotic.

2884
03:13:44,739 --> 03:13:46,100
There's too many people on this server.

2885
03:13:49,610 --> 03:13:50,090
He's dead?

2886
03:13:51,799 --> 03:13:52,200
He's not dead.

2887
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:52,520
He's not dead.

2888
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:52,840
He's still alive.

2889
03:13:52,840 --> 03:13:53,319
He's still alive.

2890
03:13:53,959 --> 03:13:54,459
Oh wait.

2891
03:13:54,459 --> 03:13:55,100
We both died.

2892
03:14:01,270 --> 03:14:03,350
Where am I on the chart?

2893
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:04,629
I'm not even on the chart.

2894
03:14:04,629 --> 03:14:05,829
That's how you know it's not going well.

2895
03:14:05,829 --> 03:14:07,430
I got to kill some more people here.

2896
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:31,219
Oh fuck.

2897
03:14:32,940 --> 03:14:33,180
Kick.

2898
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:40,329
What?

2899
03:14:40,329 --> 03:14:40,649
Okay.

2900
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:42,409
Why couldn't I kick?

2901
03:14:44,139 --> 03:14:44,540
Okay.

2902
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:45,659
I can kick now.

2903
03:14:45,659 --> 03:14:47,659
I was literally spamming this button.

2904
03:14:47,659 --> 03:14:49,020
Did I have no stamina?

2905
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:57,690
Lord.

2906
03:14:57,690 --> 03:15:06,700
I spent all the stamina throwing rocks.

2907
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:08,139
Well, I did hit that guy right in the face.

2908
03:15:08,139 --> 03:15:08,860
So it's worth it.

2909
03:15:09,500 --> 03:15:15,219
You can't kick with a ranged weapon out.

2910
03:15:15,219 --> 03:15:15,700
Oh, really?

2911
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:18,440
I didn't even know that.

2912
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:23,340
Good to know.

2913
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:27,379
Every team I'm a part of loses.

2914
03:15:28,309 --> 03:15:34,090
Well, you could say that about all the other people on the team.

2915
03:15:34,090 --> 03:15:34,409
What?

2916
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:44,579
They win sometimes.

2917
03:15:48,899 --> 03:15:52,739
There's almost 64 people in this server.

2918
03:15:52,739 --> 03:15:55,379
You're going to put it all on the one guy that's throwing rocks?

2919
03:15:55,780 --> 03:16:06,069
I need a better weapon than that.

2920
03:16:06,069 --> 03:16:06,950
I think it sucks.

2921
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:30,200
I made him drop his lunch.

2922
03:16:30,200 --> 03:16:31,000
Oh, come on.

2923
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:31,799
We were having a duel.

2924
03:16:31,799 --> 03:16:32,600
We're having a duel.

2925
03:16:32,600 --> 03:16:33,000
You can't.

2926
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:33,239
Come on.

2927
03:16:33,239 --> 03:16:34,280
That's dishonorable.

2928
03:16:37,639 --> 03:16:39,239
Oh, this actually is just free-for-all, isn't it?

2929
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:57,540
You goddamn opportunists.

2930
03:17:20,299 --> 03:17:21,420
You can't even.

2931
03:17:21,420 --> 03:17:44,200
You guys want to swing in a circle.

2932
03:17:44,200 --> 03:17:45,159
Who the fuck is this?

2933
03:17:45,159 --> 03:17:46,360
Is that Colonel Sanders?

2934
03:18:01,930 --> 03:18:03,690
Get Colonel Sanders out of here.

2935
03:18:03,690 --> 03:18:10,870
I thought I just had a shotgun.

2936
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:18,360
That was my kill.

2937
03:18:18,360 --> 03:18:25,979
Oh, ow, ow.

2938
03:18:25,979 --> 03:18:38,500
You're going to club somebody?

2939
03:18:38,500 --> 03:18:39,219
No, I'm not.

2940
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:50,309
Fucking 60 goddamn people here.

2941
03:18:50,309 --> 03:18:50,790
Watch this.

2942
03:18:51,350 --> 03:18:53,190
Want to see a real dickhead move?

2943
03:18:53,190 --> 03:18:58,180
I'm waiting for the spawn.

2944
03:18:58,739 --> 03:19:11,690
Where did you?

2945
03:19:27,219 --> 03:19:31,459
Just look at how far down I am.

2946
03:19:31,459 --> 03:19:47,899
I'm not even up there at all.

2947
03:19:47,899 --> 03:19:49,639
Oh, it didn't kill him?

2948
03:19:49,639 --> 03:19:50,760
How is that possible?

2949
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:03,159
Get away.

2950
03:20:05,540 --> 03:20:15,770
I just turned into it.

2951
03:20:15,770 --> 03:20:19,209
AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK.

2952
03:20:19,209 --> 03:20:35,270
Come here.

2953
03:20:35,270 --> 03:20:37,780
There it goes.

2954
03:20:37,780 --> 03:20:38,340
See you later.

2955
03:20:38,579 --> 03:20:47,590
Oh, there's people just in every direction.

2956
03:20:49,379 --> 03:21:05,340
How did I end up like this?

2957
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:07,399
Holy shit.

2958
03:21:24,889 --> 03:21:39,559
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

2959
03:21:39,559 --> 03:21:42,149
Come on.

2960
03:21:42,149 --> 03:21:43,270
I got to get at least...

2961
03:21:43,270 --> 03:21:45,110
This guy has 29 kills.

2962
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:45,909
My goodness.

2963
03:22:03,540 --> 03:22:07,850
It's really just swing horizontally

2964
03:22:07,850 --> 03:22:11,860
until you take off somebody's head.

2965
03:22:11,860 --> 03:22:13,620
It's just a horizontal swing

2966
03:22:13,620 --> 03:22:15,299
until somebody's fucking head comes off.

2967
03:22:17,219 --> 03:22:18,819
We're just trimming each other's hedges.

2968
03:22:19,379 --> 03:22:27,139
That was fun.

2969
03:22:27,139 --> 03:22:28,659
This game's a lot of fun.

2970
03:22:28,659 --> 03:22:32,899
All right.

2971
03:22:32,899 --> 03:22:34,579
A couple more and then I want to make a new character.

2972
03:22:34,579 --> 03:22:36,020
I want to actually buy something.

2973
03:22:36,020 --> 03:22:47,079
Let's go red.

2974
03:22:47,979 --> 03:22:48,700
And this time...

2975
03:22:50,120 --> 03:22:51,479
Oh, I'm going to go scoundrel.

2976
03:22:52,979 --> 03:22:54,020
I like the little stab.

2977
03:22:54,020 --> 03:22:56,500
I like the little thrusties like this.

2978
03:22:56,500 --> 03:22:59,290
You just dash forward

2979
03:22:59,290 --> 03:23:07,559
and I'll test it on this guy's mouth.

2980
03:23:07,559 --> 03:23:16,020
Here we go.

2981
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:18,500
Four, three, two, one.

2982
03:23:19,930 --> 03:23:20,409
Go!

2983
03:23:32,389 --> 03:23:44,520
Oh, nice block.

2984
03:23:45,899 --> 03:23:47,819
Sorry, guys, but you're all going to burn.

2985
03:23:47,819 --> 03:23:54,840
It's all about the dance.

2986
03:24:04,579 --> 03:24:04,899
Oops.

2987
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:14,780
Oh, you've closed yourself in.

2988
03:24:14,780 --> 03:24:15,579
All right.

2989
03:24:15,579 --> 03:24:30,760
Who's left?

2990
03:24:30,760 --> 03:24:32,360
Guys, okay.

2991
03:24:32,360 --> 03:24:33,319
Well, if you're going to do that...

2992
03:24:36,760 --> 03:24:37,159
See you.

2993
03:24:39,690 --> 03:24:40,329
Just a little.

2994
03:24:40,329 --> 03:24:42,010
All it takes is just a little bit.

2995
03:24:42,010 --> 03:24:51,639
Who's left?

2996
03:24:51,639 --> 03:24:52,440
Up top?

2997
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:57,399
Who's this one person left?

2998
03:25:01,319 --> 03:25:09,819
Oh, we won.

2999
03:25:09,899 --> 03:25:11,020
Nice job.

3000
03:25:11,020 --> 03:25:11,899
If somebody throws...

3001
03:25:12,459 --> 03:25:14,459
Look at those Fortnite gamers in the middle.

3002
03:25:14,459 --> 03:25:15,979
Yeah, you guys are in the wrong game.

3003
03:25:15,979 --> 03:25:28,819
I thought it was right there.

3004
03:25:40,180 --> 03:25:40,659
Easy.

3005
03:25:40,659 --> 03:25:42,100
Too many, too many, too many, too many.

3006
03:25:42,100 --> 03:25:42,659
Back it up.

3007
03:25:42,659 --> 03:25:47,100
I'm not that I could do about that.

3008
03:25:47,100 --> 03:25:52,360
I didn't put the trap down, damn it.

3009
03:25:52,360 --> 03:25:57,129
There they go.

3010
03:26:03,340 --> 03:26:05,319
Yeah, that's too bad.

3011
03:26:11,959 --> 03:26:12,760
It's just good to...

3012
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:14,040
It's a people-watching game.

3013
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:14,600
It really is.

3014
03:26:14,600 --> 03:26:16,040
Because this guy has no idea.

3015
03:26:16,040 --> 03:26:17,319
And now there goes his leg.

3016
03:26:17,319 --> 03:26:18,840
And there's his buddy, Archer2,

3017
03:26:20,040 --> 03:26:21,399
desperately trying to fight off.

3018
03:26:22,659 --> 03:26:23,700
That guy didn't even know that

3019
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:25,219
there were five people around him.

3020
03:26:25,219 --> 03:26:27,700
He found out that this many people were here.

3021
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:30,629
Not even one second ago.

3022
03:26:30,629 --> 03:26:50,579
Oh, getting some points there.

3023
03:26:51,379 --> 03:26:52,260
Easy.

3024
03:26:52,260 --> 03:26:59,399
Caught him right around the corner.

3025
03:26:59,399 --> 03:27:01,239
You did exactly what I thought you were gonna do.

3026
03:27:15,209 --> 03:27:15,930
Poking away.

3027
03:27:15,930 --> 03:27:17,049
Just a little bit at a time.

3028
03:27:17,049 --> 03:27:17,530
He has his...

3029
03:27:17,530 --> 03:27:18,969
That's 138 damage.

3030
03:27:18,969 --> 03:27:20,250
This guy, how much health does he have?

3031
03:27:20,250 --> 03:27:33,860
All right, just the Archer over here.

3032
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:40,170
I'm gonna get accidentally hit by this.

3033
03:27:41,750 --> 03:27:42,389
Nice swing.

3034
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:45,459
Just these guys over here and that should be it.

3035
03:27:56,250 --> 03:27:57,770
I thought it was gonna spin it around.

3036
03:28:00,940 --> 03:28:01,899
Help! Help!

3037
03:28:01,899 --> 03:28:02,299
Guys!

3038
03:28:02,940 --> 03:28:03,340
Guys!

3039
03:28:09,719 --> 03:28:11,000
I don't want unnecessary death.

3040
03:28:11,639 --> 03:28:13,739
I need a weapon.

3041
03:28:13,739 --> 03:28:15,020
Who has a weapon on the ground?

3042
03:28:15,020 --> 03:28:24,200
Did we win?

3043
03:28:30,489 --> 03:28:33,270
What's going on here?

3044
03:28:33,270 --> 03:28:36,500
I'm not a coward.

3045
03:28:36,500 --> 03:28:38,899
I'm just trying to play my battles correctly.

3046
03:28:38,899 --> 03:28:40,340
Where is this person?

3047
03:28:40,340 --> 03:28:53,120
Hey!

3048
03:28:55,030 --> 03:28:56,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3049
03:28:56,790 --> 03:29:00,950
Oh, there he is.

3050
03:29:00,950 --> 03:29:11,340
All right, not doing too bad this time.

3051
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:17,959
Right in the corner here.

3052
03:29:20,229 --> 03:29:21,190
Right there, right when they turn around.

3053
03:29:21,190 --> 03:29:22,309
They're not even gonna see it.

3054
03:29:22,309 --> 03:29:27,989
I want to get a good fire bomb

3055
03:29:27,989 --> 03:29:28,790
right inside of there.

3056
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:29,670
Right up back there.

3057
03:29:30,229 --> 03:29:35,049
I think I got hit by it.

3058
03:29:35,049 --> 03:29:36,409
I think I got hit in the head by an arrow.

3059
03:29:43,750 --> 03:29:46,489
Oh, a throwing axe?

3060
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:49,350
From where?

3061
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:50,969
I was inside the corridor.

3062
03:29:51,530 --> 03:29:58,569
Look at this bullshit.

3063
03:29:59,129 --> 03:30:04,280
This is such dog shit.

3064
03:30:06,889 --> 03:30:08,889
Dude, go run around the other side.

3065
03:30:09,450 --> 03:30:10,170
Run to the right.

3066
03:30:10,170 --> 03:30:11,450
There's another opening.

3067
03:30:11,450 --> 03:30:15,350
He wants to go in through here.

3068
03:30:15,350 --> 03:30:16,549
See, there he goes.

3069
03:30:16,549 --> 03:30:17,670
He's like, yeah, that's a good idea.

3070
03:30:17,670 --> 03:30:18,149
You're right.

3071
03:30:24,950 --> 03:30:25,590
See?

3072
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:26,069
There you go.

3073
03:30:27,209 --> 03:30:29,370
You got an opportunity to maybe

3074
03:30:29,370 --> 03:30:30,489
hit the guy right in the back of the head.

3075
03:30:35,450 --> 03:30:35,770
All right.

3076
03:30:36,409 --> 03:30:36,889
Let's do...

3077
03:30:40,709 --> 03:30:47,590
I don't know.

3078
03:30:47,590 --> 03:30:48,149
Ah, shit.

3079
03:30:48,149 --> 03:30:49,030
Didn't do it fast enough.

3080
03:30:49,590 --> 03:31:01,879
Give me some ticks.

3081
03:31:01,879 --> 03:31:02,120
Come on.

3082
03:31:02,120 --> 03:31:02,840
Give me some ticks.

3083
03:31:03,829 --> 03:31:04,870
No ticks?

3084
03:31:04,870 --> 03:31:09,430
Come on, bait him.

3085
03:31:09,430 --> 03:31:09,829
Come on.

3086
03:31:10,469 --> 03:31:11,829
Oh, you dick.

3087
03:31:11,829 --> 03:31:24,629
That was bad.

3088
03:31:24,629 --> 03:31:27,829
Shit.

3089
03:31:27,829 --> 03:31:29,829
I'm backed all the way up here.

3090
03:31:29,829 --> 03:31:34,260
I think somebody's a loot.

3091
03:31:34,260 --> 03:31:44,729
All right.

3092
03:31:44,729 --> 03:31:46,250
Well, let me see if I can sneak up behind one of these.

3093
03:31:46,250 --> 03:31:46,489
No.

3094
03:31:46,489 --> 03:31:46,889
No way.

3095
03:31:49,180 --> 03:31:51,100
Isn't a real safe way to go, huh?

3096
03:31:51,100 --> 03:31:56,260
I guess whoever decides to make the first mistake.

3097
03:32:00,069 --> 03:32:00,950
Like that.

3098
03:32:00,950 --> 03:32:05,319
Oh, fuck.

3099
03:32:05,319 --> 03:32:06,120
Oh, fuck.

3100
03:32:06,120 --> 03:32:06,920
Get him.

3101
03:32:06,920 --> 03:32:07,239
What's this?

3102
03:32:07,239 --> 03:32:08,120
How does this guy in here?

3103
03:32:09,319 --> 03:32:10,520
What the fuck?

3104
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:11,639
He just climbed in here.

3105
03:32:25,500 --> 03:32:34,260
I can't believe he got up there.

3106
03:32:34,260 --> 03:32:35,059
He climbed all the way up.

3107
03:32:35,700 --> 03:32:43,979
Free guard has won.

3108
03:32:46,809 --> 03:32:49,209
Well, that's just stupid.

3109
03:32:49,209 --> 03:32:50,010
Here we go.

3110
03:32:50,010 --> 03:33:01,319
I'm sorry.

3111
03:33:01,879 --> 03:33:03,020
It's not intentional.

3112
03:33:10,969 --> 03:33:13,879
Did he seriously come all the way back to kill me?

3113
03:33:13,879 --> 03:33:14,520
What the hell?

3114
03:33:15,079 --> 03:33:20,899
He just walked in a straight line and killed me in one hit.

3115
03:33:28,709 --> 03:33:29,829
No, I don't want to be that.

3116
03:33:30,549 --> 03:33:31,989
I'm going back to Raider.

3117
03:33:35,739 --> 03:33:38,540
Hey, I know I was shooting him, but where was all my friends?

3118
03:33:39,100 --> 03:33:43,100
All right, let's get a good cinematic view of this.

3119
03:33:43,100 --> 03:33:51,590
We're following the archer.

3120
03:33:59,059 --> 03:34:00,420
They're not your friends.

3121
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:02,360
We're fighting for the same thing.

3122
03:34:03,000 --> 03:34:04,200
Our leader wants the crown.

3123
03:34:05,579 --> 03:34:07,190
We're all on the same team.

3124
03:34:07,190 --> 03:34:09,350
We all go to the same ale house together.

3125
03:34:09,350 --> 03:34:10,469
We're not friends, though.

3126
03:34:10,469 --> 03:34:10,709
How?

3127
03:34:13,540 --> 03:34:17,959
There's like 1,500 of us in the whole fucking city.

3128
03:34:18,520 --> 03:34:19,799
You don't think you know everybody here?

3129
03:34:29,770 --> 03:34:31,129
They talk about you behind your back.

3130
03:34:31,610 --> 03:34:39,290
There's a difference between a co-worker and a friend.

3131
03:34:40,010 --> 03:34:42,229
We all probably work on the same farm.

3132
03:34:44,700 --> 03:34:46,299
It's probably the same damn family.

3133
03:34:51,930 --> 03:34:54,809
All these guys came from the same like five people.

3134
03:34:54,809 --> 03:35:00,600
You want to know the history of the universe?

3135
03:35:01,239 --> 03:35:07,059
30 people all had sex with each other.

3136
03:35:07,059 --> 03:35:11,670
And then that's how we got to 10 to 11 billion people.

3137
03:35:11,670 --> 03:35:23,620
It just kept going.

3138
03:35:23,620 --> 03:35:30,729
All right, give me my...

3139
03:35:30,729 --> 03:35:31,209
No, I don't...

3140
03:35:31,209 --> 03:35:31,930
What the hell?

3141
03:35:31,930 --> 03:35:32,969
I picked Raider, didn't I?

3142
03:35:33,530 --> 03:35:35,299
I don't want to do archer again.

3143
03:35:35,299 --> 03:35:36,180
I'm not very good at it.

3144
03:35:42,809 --> 03:35:44,170
Jeremy, I don't know what sex is.

3145
03:35:44,979 --> 03:35:46,100
Someone will tell you eventually.

3146
03:35:58,100 --> 03:35:59,379
Huntsman hallway.

3147
03:36:00,180 --> 03:36:05,030
Can I take out my cleaver?

3148
03:36:06,229 --> 03:36:07,829
Honestly, why?

3149
03:36:08,389 --> 03:36:13,510
I'm starting him mashing the number two and it will not take it out.

3150
03:36:13,510 --> 03:36:14,790
I'm just going two, two, two.

3151
03:36:14,790 --> 03:36:15,030
Don't.

3152
03:36:15,030 --> 03:36:15,909
No, I'm not taking it out.

3153
03:36:15,909 --> 03:36:17,510
No, no, no, no, no.

3154
03:36:17,510 --> 03:36:17,989
Nothing.

3155
03:36:17,989 --> 03:36:18,149
No.

3156
03:36:19,030 --> 03:36:32,659
I don't understand how sex caused 30 people to go to 7 billion.

3157
03:36:33,739 --> 03:36:37,459
Well, 30 people created 80 people.

3158
03:36:37,459 --> 03:36:38,899
80 people created 160.

3159
03:36:39,059 --> 03:36:40,979
160 created 380.

3160
03:36:40,979 --> 03:36:42,659
380 created 5,000.

3161
03:36:42,659 --> 03:36:43,379
5,000...

3162
03:36:43,379 --> 03:36:45,139
Those people were having a lot of sex.

3163
03:36:45,139 --> 03:36:46,739
5,000 created 8,000.

3164
03:36:47,459 --> 03:36:49,139
8,000 created 50,000.

3165
03:36:49,139 --> 03:36:51,379
50,000 created 200,000.

3166
03:36:51,379 --> 03:36:52,579
The plague happened.

3167
03:36:52,579 --> 03:36:53,620
Minus 100,000.

3168
03:36:53,620 --> 03:36:55,219
Those 100,000 then had to make up for it.

3169
03:36:55,219 --> 03:36:56,100
So they made a million.

3170
03:36:56,739 --> 03:37:01,379
Those millions spread across the entire earth and they had a bunch of sex and got it to like a billion.

3171
03:37:01,379 --> 03:37:04,520
And that was about like 80 years ago, 100 years ago.

3172
03:37:05,159 --> 03:37:08,229
That's just how it worked.

3173
03:37:08,790 --> 03:37:17,750
There was only a million people up until like 19, but like 18 fucking 60.

3174
03:37:18,469 --> 03:37:21,270
There was less than like 425,000 people in the world.

3175
03:37:21,270 --> 03:37:21,590
I'm not...

3176
03:37:21,590 --> 03:37:27,940
Okay, I'm going to pay attention because what number of person am I?

3177
03:37:32,170 --> 03:37:32,809
Probably like...

3178
03:37:32,809 --> 03:37:33,129
That's...

3179
03:37:33,129 --> 03:37:33,450
You know what?

3180
03:37:33,450 --> 03:37:34,569
That's what an interesting question.

3181
03:37:35,209 --> 03:37:38,139
That is such an interesting question.

3182
03:37:38,139 --> 03:37:38,540
I'm serious.

3183
03:37:39,670 --> 03:37:44,229
What person are you out of the, you know, 7, 8, 9, but 8 billion, right?

3184
03:37:46,459 --> 03:37:49,180
Like 6 billion, 254 million.

3185
03:37:49,180 --> 03:37:50,299
That's an interesting question.

3186
03:37:51,340 --> 03:38:01,219
Oh God.

3187
03:38:01,219 --> 03:38:02,180
Got you.

3188
03:38:02,180 --> 03:38:03,219
Got you right around the corner.

3189
03:38:06,780 --> 03:38:07,739
Gonna help you.

3190
03:38:07,739 --> 03:38:08,219
Coming in.

3191
03:38:08,940 --> 03:38:09,500
Oh my God.

3192
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:09,979
There was two.

3193
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:15,350
No.

3194
03:38:15,350 --> 03:38:16,440
Fuck.

3195
03:38:16,440 --> 03:38:17,239
Oh God.

3196
03:38:17,239 --> 03:38:18,200
I knew they were behind me.

3197
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:21,110
Oh, they're everywhere.

3198
03:38:21,110 --> 03:38:24,139
Nothing.

3199
03:38:24,139 --> 03:38:25,020
Haven't done anything.

3200
03:38:29,290 --> 03:38:33,270
See, German, you know, you're on the losing team every time.

3201
03:38:33,270 --> 03:38:38,569
It's not, it has nothing to do with the guy holding his sword in his hand in the back

3202
03:38:40,440 --> 03:38:44,780
or the guy hitting him with the giant spoon.

3203
03:38:46,950 --> 03:38:48,870
But it's, it's my fault.

3204
03:38:48,950 --> 03:38:50,709
It's my fault.

3205
03:38:50,709 --> 03:38:56,010
That's the enemy team.

3206
03:39:00,120 --> 03:39:01,559
That's the other team.

3207
03:39:01,559 --> 03:39:03,959
Oh, well, I was on that team before.

3208
03:39:11,979 --> 03:39:13,260
I'm just getting the fuck in there.

3209
03:39:14,149 --> 03:39:14,629
No, I'm not.

3210
03:39:15,190 --> 03:39:24,809
It's so fun.

3211
03:39:24,809 --> 03:39:25,610
Just a whip shit.

3212
03:39:38,379 --> 03:39:39,579
We've got less people over here.

3213
03:39:46,809 --> 03:39:47,370
Oh shit.

3214
03:39:47,370 --> 03:39:47,770
Too many.

3215
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:49,899
Oh, there's fire.

3216
03:39:49,899 --> 03:39:50,940
Look at all the fire everywhere.

3217
03:39:52,090 --> 03:39:53,049
Aye, aye, aye.

3218
03:39:53,850 --> 03:39:57,850
That's too many.

3219
03:39:57,850 --> 03:40:01,290
It's that they, how do we, how do they get so many back here so quickly?

3220
03:40:02,010 --> 03:40:06,709
It's like, seriously, there's two of them.

3221
03:40:06,709 --> 03:40:08,309
And then they have sex, and then there's fucking eight,

3222
03:40:08,309 --> 03:40:09,590
and then all of a sudden there's fucking 15,

3223
03:40:09,590 --> 03:40:11,350
and then there's 50 just standing around you.

3224
03:40:20,790 --> 03:40:25,610
See, this is, we need you on the front lines.

3225
03:40:32,309 --> 03:40:33,190
You're not going to make it.

3226
03:40:33,829 --> 03:40:34,870
They're not going to make it.

3227
03:40:34,870 --> 03:40:36,309
I can't believe you're making it.

3228
03:40:37,270 --> 03:40:38,549
This should never work.

3229
03:40:39,770 --> 03:40:43,209
The guy with the pole arm has killed I think six people so far.

3230
03:40:54,469 --> 03:40:55,270
Switch teams.

3231
03:40:58,100 --> 03:40:59,299
This game is really fun.

3232
03:40:59,860 --> 03:41:04,819
All you need to win a war is a stick with a pointy end.

3233
03:41:07,209 --> 03:41:08,170
We need a lot of those.

3234
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:15,459
You need at least two to three hundred thousand of those.

3235
03:41:15,459 --> 03:41:19,100
If we were to talk about a scenario back in the medieval times,

3236
03:41:20,709 --> 03:41:27,030
it was, guys, you remember war back five hundred thousand years ago?

3237
03:41:27,030 --> 03:41:31,459
It was like, it was like maybe 80 people.

3238
03:41:31,459 --> 03:41:34,180
It was like 60 people versus 150 people.

3239
03:41:38,010 --> 03:41:41,209
Maybe there was like, it was like a thousand versus a thousand total.

3240
03:41:41,209 --> 03:41:46,459
There weren't very many people on earth.

3241
03:41:55,450 --> 03:41:58,010
Somebody said, I can't listen to this anymore.

3242
03:41:58,010 --> 03:41:58,250
Bye.

3243
03:41:59,129 --> 03:42:07,639
What's the truth?

3244
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:23,100
Even people in the Roman age were 50k.

3245
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:24,540
I know, I'm just fucking around.

3246
03:42:40,440 --> 03:42:50,629
Oh, you guys really don't think I thought that like 200 people fought a war

3247
03:42:50,629 --> 03:42:51,989
back in like the medieval times, right?

3248
03:42:53,979 --> 03:42:56,940
If you do, then I must be a pretty good actor then.

3249
03:42:57,579 --> 03:42:58,940
And I am, so I already know that.

3250
03:43:01,450 --> 03:43:02,489
Damn good fucking actor.

3251
03:43:22,659 --> 03:43:25,139
If you could redo your life again with cheat codes, what would you put on?

3252
03:43:25,139 --> 03:43:33,059
I could like snap my fingers and get a meatball sub.

3253
03:43:34,969 --> 03:43:35,770
That's pretty handy.

3254
03:43:36,489 --> 03:43:38,620
I don't want to fly or any of that bullshit.

3255
03:43:39,659 --> 03:43:54,940
Oh, let's go.

3256
03:43:54,940 --> 03:43:57,690
Let's go back to the, try this guy again.

3257
03:44:05,799 --> 03:44:07,260
Well, I stumbled.

3258
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:22,680
Oh, who's dead?

3259
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:23,399
Both.

3260
03:44:23,399 --> 03:44:30,870
And you really, you know, I'm just going to leave you alone

3261
03:44:30,870 --> 03:44:34,229
because you're like, you really want to, you really want to get that done.

3262
03:44:58,520 --> 03:44:59,799
I'm protecting them right now.

3263
03:44:59,799 --> 03:45:11,639
No, I'm getting out of here.

3264
03:45:11,639 --> 03:45:12,760
Watch that over swing.

3265
03:45:12,760 --> 03:45:24,010
Watch that over swing.

3266
03:45:24,010 --> 03:45:26,010
Oh, I thought I was going to get killed by the guy behind him.

3267
03:45:26,010 --> 03:45:31,030
I had a streak going there.

3268
03:45:31,030 --> 03:45:37,420
That wasn't bad.

3269
03:45:37,420 --> 03:45:39,139
What?

3270
03:45:39,139 --> 03:45:40,700
What?

3271
03:45:40,700 --> 03:45:41,340
From behind?

3272
03:45:42,979 --> 03:45:43,540
Hmm.

3273
03:45:43,540 --> 03:45:45,139
I think someone came behind me.

3274
03:45:54,950 --> 03:45:58,780
Oh, he came out of nowhere again.

3275
03:45:58,780 --> 03:46:00,299
Is blocking directional automatic?

3276
03:46:00,299 --> 03:46:03,909
It is not.

3277
03:46:03,909 --> 03:46:06,790
It's right click.

3278
03:46:06,790 --> 03:46:07,750
Really, I just blew it.

3279
03:46:19,110 --> 03:46:19,670
Faked him out.

3280
03:46:21,049 --> 03:46:23,370
Ooh, he's got a little streak going, doesn't he?

3281
03:46:23,370 --> 03:46:46,100
Come on, where am I at?

3282
03:46:46,100 --> 03:46:46,979
14?

3283
03:46:46,979 --> 03:46:48,180
The highest is 24.

3284
03:46:48,180 --> 03:47:09,559
That's not going to happen, I don't think.

3285
03:47:09,559 --> 03:47:10,520
From behind again.

3286
03:47:10,520 --> 03:47:13,079
I got to go back against the wall.

3287
03:47:13,079 --> 03:47:18,629
I just got back to German make this in dreams.

3288
03:47:20,069 --> 03:47:20,549
Yeah.

3289
03:47:20,549 --> 03:47:36,500
I've been behind me, right?

3290
03:47:36,500 --> 03:47:37,620
I tried to fake him out.

3291
03:47:37,620 --> 03:47:38,500
Didn't work.

3292
03:47:38,500 --> 03:47:43,909
Watch out.

3293
03:47:43,909 --> 03:47:44,469
Watch out.

3294
03:47:44,469 --> 03:47:46,069
Always took back against wall.

3295
03:47:46,069 --> 03:48:01,299
Fuck, everyone just keeps coming in.

3296
03:48:01,299 --> 03:48:04,219
It's like the WWF.

3297
03:48:04,219 --> 03:48:07,020
I'm in the ring and the keep interference just keeps happening.

3298
03:48:07,020 --> 03:48:09,739
All right, I'll take top five.

3299
03:48:09,739 --> 03:48:11,139
That's the first time it's happened.

3300
03:48:18,280 --> 03:48:19,559
Only 280 gold.

3301
03:48:19,559 --> 03:48:21,559
I feel like I deserve more than that.

3302
03:48:21,559 --> 03:48:27,799
I kind of just want to keep playing.

3303
03:48:27,799 --> 03:48:29,479
This is, I'm just having a good time.

3304
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:44,889
I'm going to get to level three.

3305
03:48:44,889 --> 03:48:47,129
Actually fun game in 2019.

3306
03:48:49,620 --> 03:48:51,620
Yeah, it's just kind of fun to play.

3307
03:48:54,139 --> 03:48:57,020
I didn't think I was going to be this entertained by it, but I am.

3308
03:48:57,579 --> 03:48:59,379
Let me try this guy again.

3309
03:49:01,020 --> 03:49:06,069
So this dude is a big heavy evening star.

3310
03:49:06,709 --> 03:49:09,030
So you really want to just try to club people in the head with this.

3311
03:49:09,670 --> 03:49:12,059
What about does it changing?

3312
03:49:12,059 --> 03:49:12,780
I can't change the...

3313
03:49:13,340 --> 03:49:15,739
Okay, I can change it into a...

3314
03:49:16,299 --> 03:49:17,590
I hold it closer.

3315
03:49:22,200 --> 03:49:24,200
So this is, I guess, short range or...

3316
03:49:24,200 --> 03:49:28,180
Let's see what it does.

3317
03:49:30,840 --> 03:49:32,440
Oh, there's so many coming.

3318
03:49:32,440 --> 03:49:34,059
What else do I got?

3319
03:49:34,059 --> 03:49:34,559
Nothing.

3320
03:49:43,590 --> 03:49:44,549
That's too many.

3321
03:49:45,190 --> 03:49:59,129
All right.

3322
03:49:59,129 --> 03:50:00,090
Shit, I thought he was going to...

3323
03:50:02,469 --> 03:50:03,909
Damn, I'm trying to fake him out.

3324
03:50:05,290 --> 03:50:06,329
I'm starting to do that more often.

3325
03:50:06,329 --> 03:50:07,530
That's actually a really good tactic.

3326
03:50:07,530 --> 03:50:10,489
You do the stab and then people try to block it, but then you come over with an overhead.

3327
03:50:11,290 --> 03:50:15,139
It's very, very effective.

3328
03:50:15,139 --> 03:50:16,020
I got to do that more often.

3329
03:50:17,159 --> 03:50:18,200
I'm getting a little better.

3330
03:50:18,200 --> 03:50:22,790
I'm starting to understand mechanics and opportunity and stuff like that.

3331
03:50:22,790 --> 03:50:23,909
And stuff like that.

3332
03:50:27,799 --> 03:50:28,120
All right.

3333
03:50:28,120 --> 03:50:30,040
Well, not when there's this many.

3334
03:50:30,600 --> 03:50:38,549
Come on, give it back, back, back, back.

3335
03:50:38,549 --> 03:50:47,909
I got an assist somehow.

3336
03:50:49,879 --> 03:50:50,280
All right.

3337
03:50:50,280 --> 03:50:52,200
I want to go down here.

3338
03:50:52,200 --> 03:50:55,319
I'm more useful when I can get in like a one-on-one or a one-on-two scenario.

3339
03:50:56,040 --> 03:50:56,520
Like this.

3340
03:51:03,940 --> 03:51:04,500
That.

3341
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:05,299
Yeah.

3342
03:51:05,299 --> 03:51:05,700
All right.

3343
03:51:05,700 --> 03:51:06,340
Come on, bring it on.

3344
03:51:07,059 --> 03:51:12,229
He blocked all of that somehow.

3345
03:51:12,950 --> 03:51:15,030
This magic shield.

3346
03:51:18,540 --> 03:51:19,500
Look at this guy.

3347
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:19,819
Wow.

3348
03:51:38,340 --> 03:51:38,739
Damn it.

3349
03:51:38,739 --> 03:51:39,540
I was doing so well.

3350
03:51:39,540 --> 03:51:40,260
Come on.

3351
03:51:40,260 --> 03:51:44,540
I'm still doing all right.

3352
03:51:44,540 --> 03:51:45,659
That was me.

3353
03:51:45,659 --> 03:51:46,219
No, it was me.

3354
03:52:01,610 --> 03:52:15,739
All right, good.

3355
03:52:15,739 --> 03:52:17,430
This guy's trapped in here.

3356
03:52:19,139 --> 03:52:19,780
All right, move up.

3357
03:52:21,030 --> 03:52:21,989
Nice team damage.

3358
03:52:21,989 --> 03:52:22,389
I know.

3359
03:52:23,110 --> 03:52:24,149
I'm trying.

3360
03:52:24,149 --> 03:52:26,889
I'll take a medic bag though.

3361
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:41,719
Get out of here.

3362
03:52:41,719 --> 03:52:43,559
He's just laughing with all of his...

3363
03:52:43,559 --> 03:52:44,520
Are they even attacking me?

3364
03:52:45,159 --> 03:52:50,309
How do they all get back here?

3365
03:52:50,790 --> 03:53:16,299
Oh, fuck.

3366
03:53:16,299 --> 03:53:17,020
You got...

3367
03:53:17,020 --> 03:53:18,139
You'd be kidding me.

3368
03:53:18,139 --> 03:53:21,559
That dude seriously went around in a full circle.

3369
03:53:21,559 --> 03:53:42,500
I really...

3370
03:53:42,500 --> 03:53:46,600
No.

3371
03:53:46,600 --> 03:53:47,719
He was behind me.

3372
03:53:47,719 --> 03:54:05,129
That's not our horse, right?

3373
03:54:05,129 --> 03:54:06,409
That is enemy horse.

3374
03:54:07,590 --> 03:54:08,389
Dead ahead.

3375
03:54:08,389 --> 03:54:22,840
How did that not hit him?

3376
03:54:22,840 --> 03:54:31,209
Geez.

3377
03:54:35,930 --> 03:54:36,809
We missed.

3378
03:54:36,809 --> 03:54:43,399
Did you really just duck that?

3379
03:54:49,829 --> 03:55:08,600
We've got ourselves a gamer here.

3380
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:23,829
I didn't do anything.

3381
03:55:23,829 --> 03:55:25,030
I was watching him die.

3382
03:55:25,030 --> 03:55:30,180
Can you please stop blizzing?

3383
03:55:30,180 --> 03:55:31,540
My son is watching.

3384
03:55:31,540 --> 03:55:33,219
Son's not old enough to watch this game.

3385
03:55:33,219 --> 03:55:35,020
I'm sorry.

3386
03:55:35,020 --> 03:55:35,739
He just doesn't...

3387
03:55:35,739 --> 03:55:54,520
Is the game still in development?

3388
03:55:54,520 --> 03:55:55,239
I don't think so.

3389
03:55:55,959 --> 03:55:57,879
I think they're gonna keep adding stuff, right?

3390
03:55:58,440 --> 03:55:59,719
But is it...

3391
03:55:59,719 --> 03:56:00,680
I don't think it's early access.

3392
03:56:01,559 --> 03:56:03,639
Is it?

3393
03:56:03,639 --> 03:56:05,239
My son is 35.

3394
03:56:05,239 --> 03:56:06,680
Well, then that changes everything.

3395
03:56:18,120 --> 03:56:19,079
Onward we go.

3396
03:56:19,719 --> 03:56:24,940
A little chip damage.

3397
03:56:24,940 --> 03:56:25,899
It's all good.

3398
03:56:25,899 --> 03:56:35,770
Don't hurt each other.

3399
03:56:37,370 --> 03:56:38,809
I know it's easier said than done, but...

3400
03:56:45,899 --> 03:56:46,940
Open the door.

3401
03:56:46,940 --> 03:56:47,500
Open the door.

3402
03:56:48,059 --> 03:56:49,340
Open this door right now.

3403
03:56:49,340 --> 03:56:51,020
Can we get an axe guy to break the door open, please?

3404
03:56:55,799 --> 03:56:56,280
Axe.

3405
03:56:56,280 --> 03:56:57,159
Kick door open.

3406
03:56:57,159 --> 03:56:58,360
Somebody open this door.

3407
03:56:59,479 --> 03:57:00,280
Open the door.

3408
03:57:00,920 --> 03:57:09,620
I'll reach in there.

3409
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:10,340
All right.

3410
03:57:10,340 --> 03:57:11,059
Okay.

3411
03:57:11,059 --> 03:57:11,860
Okay.

3412
03:57:11,860 --> 03:57:12,979
God damn it.

3413
03:57:15,030 --> 03:57:15,989
This was planned.

3414
03:57:16,629 --> 03:57:18,069
This was a planned thing.

3415
03:57:20,500 --> 03:57:22,100
I hope you guys are having fun.

3416
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:33,000
The old door-stuck guy wraps around trick.

3417
03:57:33,639 --> 03:57:48,860
Stop opening the door.

3418
03:57:48,860 --> 03:57:49,899
My son is in there.

3419
03:57:52,549 --> 03:57:57,639
So we share this castle.

3420
03:57:57,639 --> 03:57:59,479
And his son's like 40.

3421
03:57:59,479 --> 03:58:06,309
In fact, what's he doing here?

3422
03:58:06,309 --> 03:58:16,860
This is my castle.

3423
03:58:16,860 --> 03:58:17,579
Yeah, that's like...

3424
03:58:17,579 --> 03:58:18,940
That's the stables down there.

3425
03:58:18,940 --> 03:58:20,059
He's hanging out in the stables.

3426
03:58:20,059 --> 03:58:21,100
You're not supposed to be down there.

3427
03:58:21,819 --> 03:58:22,620
After four o'clock.

3428
03:58:22,620 --> 03:58:23,979
You know that already.

3429
03:58:23,979 --> 03:58:28,090
We've got some really great shit in the chat room there.

3430
03:58:28,090 --> 03:58:30,889
Somebody said, I actually eat poo-poo pee-pee.

3431
03:58:31,610 --> 03:58:36,010
I'm talking about like top of the line chat box stuff going on in there.

3432
03:58:37,959 --> 03:58:39,399
So, you know, that's great.

3433
03:58:43,399 --> 03:58:45,079
I'm not getting door baited again.

3434
03:58:45,079 --> 03:58:46,200
That's not gonna happen.

3435
03:58:46,200 --> 03:58:47,079
I'm going down here.

3436
03:58:47,799 --> 03:58:54,010
Are you serious?

3437
03:58:54,010 --> 03:58:55,370
Like, what the fuck are you doing?

3438
03:59:15,260 --> 03:59:16,379
Oh, I bled out.

3439
03:59:23,659 --> 03:59:25,100
Jeremy, I think you're projecting.

3440
03:59:25,739 --> 03:59:32,379
There's one person.

3441
03:59:32,379 --> 03:59:34,620
The guy with the pregnant girlfriend

3442
03:59:34,620 --> 03:59:37,100
is the only person on the team that's doing anything.

3443
03:59:37,819 --> 03:59:38,780
Look at the rest of us.

3444
03:59:39,340 --> 03:59:44,149
I guess we're four people.

3445
03:59:44,149 --> 03:59:50,329
I want to see what's going on in here.

3446
03:59:50,329 --> 03:59:51,850
I'm actually, I'm curious.

3447
03:59:51,850 --> 03:59:52,969
Am I banned from going in here?

3448
03:59:54,250 --> 03:59:55,850
Even as a ghost, I can't go in here.

3449
04:00:12,549 --> 04:00:13,590
Yeah, I almost walked into it.

3450
04:00:14,229 --> 04:00:16,280
All right.

3451
04:00:16,280 --> 04:00:18,040
I need to get at least one or two kills.

3452
04:00:18,040 --> 04:00:18,920
I have to.

3453
04:00:18,920 --> 04:00:19,959
I can't just sit at zero.

3454
04:00:25,450 --> 04:00:26,170
Watch the back.

3455
04:00:26,889 --> 04:00:28,860
They like to come around there.

3456
04:00:29,500 --> 04:00:36,059
I can do that too.

3457
04:00:36,700 --> 04:00:58,920
Thank you.

3458
04:00:58,920 --> 04:01:06,780
Didn't get it off first.

3459
04:01:07,420 --> 04:01:08,459
Thought I did.

3460
04:01:08,459 --> 04:01:14,309
Close the door.

3461
04:01:14,309 --> 04:01:18,700
This is bad.

3462
04:01:18,700 --> 04:01:20,780
There's gonna be a reason why we're not supposed to be going up here.

3463
04:01:20,780 --> 04:01:29,379
And there's the reason right there.

3464
04:01:29,379 --> 04:01:29,780
All right.

3465
04:01:29,780 --> 04:01:30,819
Okay, I got him once.

3466
04:01:32,090 --> 04:01:32,889
Easy, easy.

3467
04:01:32,889 --> 04:01:37,719
Don't get piled up here.

3468
04:01:37,719 --> 04:01:39,079
This is gonna be a disaster.

3469
04:01:44,860 --> 04:01:57,860
Watch out behind, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.

3470
04:01:57,860 --> 04:01:58,420
Oh, God.

3471
04:01:58,420 --> 04:01:58,739
Oh, God.

3472
04:01:58,739 --> 04:01:59,700
We're surrounded.

3473
04:01:59,700 --> 04:02:05,979
You can go.

3474
04:02:05,979 --> 04:02:06,379
Whoa.

3475
04:02:06,379 --> 04:02:07,579
No, no, no, no.

3476
04:02:07,579 --> 04:02:08,219
Oh, that guy.

3477
04:02:09,180 --> 04:02:19,260
Oh, my God.

3478
04:02:22,100 --> 04:02:22,899
Oh, there's too many.

3479
04:02:30,790 --> 04:02:35,139
I couldn't see what was behind me.

3480
04:02:44,940 --> 04:02:45,500
Coward.

3481
04:02:45,500 --> 04:02:45,979
How would you?

3482
04:02:47,540 --> 04:02:49,219
I was trying to be tactical.

3483
04:02:49,219 --> 04:02:58,069
Watch out.

3484
04:02:58,069 --> 04:02:59,430
He's gonna get around us.

3485
04:02:59,430 --> 04:03:02,520
He's dead.

3486
04:03:02,520 --> 04:03:08,420
Didn't hit anybody.

3487
04:03:08,420 --> 04:03:08,659
How?

3488
04:03:09,659 --> 04:03:13,739
Kick him off.

3489
04:03:13,739 --> 04:03:14,219
A bunch of...

3490
04:03:19,260 --> 04:03:20,299
Oh, God, please.

3491
04:03:23,399 --> 04:03:24,360
I just got sniped.

3492
04:03:24,360 --> 04:03:27,000
Not by a stream, but by an arrow.

3493
04:03:34,170 --> 04:03:37,799
Just watching the guy go down.

3494
04:03:37,799 --> 04:03:39,159
I didn't have any health left.

3495
04:03:39,159 --> 04:03:40,440
Of course, I'm gonna die from that.

3496
04:03:44,069 --> 04:03:44,629
Firebat.

3497
04:03:44,629 --> 04:03:45,590
Yeah, it was behind me.

3498
04:03:45,829 --> 04:03:47,430
I had like 15 health left.

3499
04:03:47,989 --> 04:04:00,120
I'm gonna play that.

3500
04:04:00,120 --> 04:04:01,399
Remember when he was getting better?

3501
04:04:01,399 --> 04:04:02,040
Well, look at...

3502
04:04:02,040 --> 04:04:03,559
Okay, look at the team.

3503
04:04:07,819 --> 04:04:10,700
I'm technically in fourth place on the team.

3504
04:04:13,399 --> 04:04:14,280
Technically, that's...

3505
04:04:14,280 --> 04:04:15,559
I'm just giving you facts here.

3506
04:04:16,280 --> 04:04:33,000
Without making it political, pee or poo.

3507
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:33,959
Both at the same time.

3508
04:04:34,600 --> 04:04:36,340
Does that make you happy?

3509
04:04:47,219 --> 04:04:47,940
What?

3510
04:04:47,940 --> 04:04:51,940
Somebody pushed me into the fucking thing.

3511
04:04:56,250 --> 04:04:57,850
I got wedged in.

3512
04:04:59,180 --> 04:04:59,979
Why?

3513
04:05:00,780 --> 04:05:01,260
No.

3514
04:05:03,260 --> 04:05:04,459
Give me a break.

3515
04:05:05,719 --> 04:05:06,920
Why is that even there?

3516
04:05:08,200 --> 04:05:11,559
There's fucking 40 fucking people in the spawn.

3517
04:05:13,209 --> 04:05:13,930
And somebody...

3518
04:05:13,930 --> 04:05:14,489
Oh, yeah.

3519
04:05:14,489 --> 04:05:15,850
It was just like, sorry to eat, kid.

3520
04:05:16,329 --> 04:05:17,049
Excuse me.

3521
04:05:17,049 --> 04:05:17,770
Get out of my way.

3522
04:05:17,770 --> 04:05:23,690
We were out there.

3523
04:05:23,690 --> 04:05:25,530
I was standing right here and it was like...

3524
04:05:27,530 --> 04:05:31,579
What the fuck?

3525
04:05:32,139 --> 04:05:33,540
Clip it.

3526
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:34,340
I wanna see it.

3527
04:05:34,340 --> 04:05:35,059
Somebody watch it.

3528
04:05:35,620 --> 04:05:52,629
I think you need to adjust the difficulty.

3529
04:05:52,629 --> 04:05:54,709
Well, now I'm not in fucking fourth place anymore

3530
04:05:54,709 --> 04:05:55,829
because I don't even get to play this one.

3531
04:05:56,469 --> 04:06:00,739
Did the Sonic movie trailer haunt your day?

3532
04:06:04,629 --> 04:06:07,590
Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they even make that movie.

3533
04:06:10,219 --> 04:06:13,899
Super Mario Brothers even knows to stay the fuck away from film.

3534
04:06:14,459 --> 04:06:29,510
There is a Mario movie.

3535
04:06:29,510 --> 04:06:33,270
Yeah, and it's widely seen as one of the worst movies ever made.

3536
04:06:36,780 --> 04:06:38,620
That shouldn't be a barometer there.

3537
04:06:38,620 --> 04:06:44,780
All right, make sure you don't get pushed.

3538
04:06:49,299 --> 04:06:49,780
Watch this.

3539
04:06:55,739 --> 04:06:56,540
Go ahead, open the door.

3540
04:06:56,540 --> 04:06:57,659
Come on, somebody walk out there.

3541
04:06:58,379 --> 04:07:00,629
Dude, the one time...

3542
04:07:01,909 --> 04:07:10,200
I'm going this way.

3543
04:07:10,200 --> 04:07:17,829
He's dead, right?

3544
04:07:17,829 --> 04:07:18,229
He's dead?

3545
04:07:18,950 --> 04:07:19,909
He better be.

3546
04:07:19,909 --> 04:07:20,549
He's not dead.

3547
04:07:21,190 --> 04:07:31,899
There's so many people right there.

3548
04:07:31,899 --> 04:07:38,219
Are we really doing this again?

3549
04:07:38,219 --> 04:07:48,500
Watch this right side.

3550
04:07:48,500 --> 04:07:56,149
They're retreating.

3551
04:07:56,149 --> 04:08:03,909
That means they don't have much health.

3552
04:08:03,909 --> 04:08:09,110
Again.

3553
04:08:09,110 --> 04:08:09,510
Nice.

3554
04:08:09,510 --> 04:08:17,100
Good work.

3555
04:08:17,100 --> 04:08:17,819
See you.

3556
04:08:17,819 --> 04:08:19,659
Okay, good.

3557
04:08:19,659 --> 04:08:20,459
Who's left?

3558
04:08:20,459 --> 04:08:29,110
That is not a good battle cry.

3559
04:08:29,110 --> 04:08:31,370
See, look, I've climbed all the way back up.

3560
04:08:36,600 --> 04:08:37,959
17 kills.

3561
04:08:40,819 --> 04:08:41,540
Don't fall down.

3562
04:08:42,950 --> 04:08:43,190
See?

3563
04:08:43,190 --> 04:08:43,829
He almost just did.

3564
04:08:43,829 --> 04:08:44,069
See?

3565
04:08:44,069 --> 04:08:45,129
He did.

3566
04:08:45,129 --> 04:08:46,069
Look.

3567
04:08:46,069 --> 04:08:48,170
He did.

3568
04:08:48,170 --> 04:08:52,069
He fell all the way down.

3569
04:08:52,069 --> 04:08:52,629
He did.

3570
04:08:52,629 --> 04:09:12,600
I don't want to do that.

3571
04:09:12,600 --> 04:09:15,590
How am I hitting a teammate there?

3572
04:09:15,590 --> 04:09:21,079
Well, now you got to get down.

3573
04:09:23,239 --> 04:09:23,879
Fuck.

3574
04:09:23,879 --> 04:09:25,530
No!

3575
04:09:26,329 --> 04:09:28,010
What the hell was I doing?

3576
04:09:31,860 --> 04:09:33,459
No!

3577
04:09:33,459 --> 04:09:35,829
Why did I do that?

3578
04:09:35,829 --> 04:09:39,510
I got a kill for it, but I lit like two of my teammates on fire.

3579
04:09:39,510 --> 04:09:40,229
Fuck.

3580
04:09:40,229 --> 04:09:52,020
The person that made the Minions movie is making a Mario movie.

3581
04:09:55,959 --> 04:09:57,559
It's hard to do a Mario movie though,

3582
04:09:59,860 --> 04:10:03,620
because just by its very nature, Mario doesn't talk.

3583
04:10:03,620 --> 04:10:04,860
I know he did.

3584
04:10:04,860 --> 04:10:07,500
I know there was the Mario Super Show and all that shit,

3585
04:10:07,500 --> 04:10:10,059
but if it's a cartoon, like 3D animation,

3586
04:10:10,860 --> 04:10:11,899
Mario doesn't really talk.

3587
04:10:16,170 --> 04:10:19,850
Is it just going to be Mario is no dialogue?

3588
04:10:22,620 --> 04:10:24,620
Yeah, a Mario movie is way harder than a Sonic movie,

3589
04:10:24,620 --> 04:10:25,899
because Sonic never shuts the fuck up.

3590
04:10:29,940 --> 04:10:33,379
Half of Sonic the Hedgehog's appeal is he talks really loudly,

3591
04:10:34,379 --> 04:10:35,500
and all the time.

3592
04:10:36,790 --> 04:10:40,260
So Mario doesn't really do that.

3593
04:10:40,260 --> 04:10:42,100
I mean, maybe Luigi, but Luigi,

3594
04:10:42,100 --> 04:10:43,620
they've made the characters over the years

3595
04:10:45,129 --> 04:10:46,649
very, very simple language,

3596
04:10:47,989 --> 04:10:49,270
really easy to understand.

3597
04:10:49,270 --> 04:10:53,350
You know, like, oh, oh, bingo, right?

3598
04:10:53,350 --> 04:10:54,469
How do you make a whole movie of that?

3599
04:10:57,989 --> 04:11:00,229
Their dialogue is all in Mario Kart.

3600
04:11:00,229 --> 04:11:06,899
I'm dead.

3601
04:11:06,899 --> 04:11:20,819
Now I want to play with here.

3602
04:11:20,819 --> 04:11:23,379
I need to get some more items and armor and shit.

3603
04:11:26,840 --> 04:11:27,719
They did Minions.

3604
04:11:27,719 --> 04:11:30,329
Yeah, but are the Minions?

3605
04:11:32,540 --> 04:11:33,979
I mean, I never seen the movie or anything,

3606
04:11:33,979 --> 04:11:37,399
but do the, I don't think I've even played once with Knight.

3607
04:11:38,040 --> 04:11:40,969
Aren't there other people that are in those movies

3608
04:11:40,969 --> 04:11:43,370
that talk for the Minions essentially?

3609
04:11:43,370 --> 04:11:45,049
They're the ones that are there

3610
04:11:45,049 --> 04:11:47,770
to kind of experience the world with you in a way?

3611
04:11:50,469 --> 04:11:51,430
Or do the Minions just,

3612
04:11:51,989 --> 04:11:53,989
it's just absolutely can't understand anything?

3613
04:11:58,340 --> 04:11:59,059
Peach can talk.

3614
04:11:59,059 --> 04:12:00,500
Yeah, I mean, but you need a character

3615
04:12:00,500 --> 04:12:02,579
that is going to have most of the dialogue,

3616
04:12:04,020 --> 04:12:05,620
unless they're really going to make Mario

3617
04:12:08,229 --> 04:12:11,030
fully voice acted dialogue.

3618
04:12:11,030 --> 04:12:13,270
I mean, Taro's Martinet, right?

3619
04:12:13,270 --> 04:12:14,149
He's still doing it.

3620
04:12:14,149 --> 04:12:15,110
Is he still doing it?

3621
04:12:21,180 --> 04:12:22,299
I wonder if he would just do it.

3622
04:12:22,860 --> 04:12:30,600
You see, he was doing it for a very, very long time.

3623
04:12:37,750 --> 04:12:40,229
Fully voice acted Wario in the last WarioWare game.

3624
04:12:40,950 --> 04:12:42,229
I'm all for it.

3625
04:12:42,229 --> 04:12:43,590
I'm all for the attempt, right?

3626
04:12:49,420 --> 04:12:52,780
But having a protagonist that doesn't really speak.

3627
04:12:52,780 --> 04:12:53,739
That was beautiful.

3628
04:12:53,739 --> 04:12:54,780
Hit him in the face with a hammer.

3629
04:12:55,420 --> 04:12:58,459
He's going to get away with that.

3630
04:13:01,909 --> 04:13:04,389
Just one blacksmith versus an army.

3631
04:13:04,950 --> 04:13:13,319
He has a voice actor.

3632
04:13:13,319 --> 04:13:14,840
Yeah, but he doesn't really,

3633
04:13:16,549 --> 04:13:19,590
Mario doesn't have a fully scripted dialogue.

3634
04:13:19,590 --> 04:13:20,549
He has phrases.

3635
04:13:21,190 --> 04:13:30,700
I'm going to put a bear trap down right here,

3636
04:13:31,260 --> 04:13:32,729
right at the top of the stairs.

3637
04:13:47,979 --> 04:13:48,479
Die!

3638
04:13:48,940 --> 04:13:52,090
Did he not die?

3639
04:13:52,090 --> 04:13:53,129
I'm surprised by that.

3640
04:13:53,770 --> 04:13:58,260
He did die.

3641
04:13:58,260 --> 04:14:00,340
He fell for a very, very, very long time.

3642
04:14:08,729 --> 04:14:09,690
Did he not die?

3643
04:14:09,690 --> 04:14:10,329
No, he did.

3644
04:14:20,059 --> 04:14:20,780
You used the loot?

3645
04:14:23,000 --> 04:14:24,760
I'm so useless with this character.

3646
04:14:24,760 --> 04:14:25,479
In a little bit.

3647
04:14:25,479 --> 04:14:25,979
Not right now.

3648
04:14:26,680 --> 04:14:32,600
Oh, somebody went in the bear trap.

3649
04:14:32,600 --> 04:14:34,200
Okay, that makes more sense, doesn't it?

3650
04:14:43,670 --> 04:14:45,750
Let me show the action, Jeremy.

3651
04:14:45,750 --> 04:14:46,250
Come on.

3652
04:15:00,219 --> 04:15:01,420
You the last one standing?

3653
04:15:02,549 --> 04:15:04,069
I think there are two red archers left.

3654
04:15:11,049 --> 04:15:11,610
Scary.

3655
04:15:17,899 --> 04:15:18,700
Almost.

3656
04:15:18,700 --> 04:15:19,899
Very close.

3657
04:15:19,899 --> 04:15:24,219
Is he dropping them from above?

3658
04:15:26,739 --> 04:15:28,389
Bear trap.

3659
04:15:28,389 --> 04:15:29,510
Not cool.

3660
04:15:29,510 --> 04:15:30,469
Not cool.

3661
04:15:30,469 --> 04:15:42,700
Oh, well.

3662
04:15:42,700 --> 04:15:48,940
We tried.

3663
04:15:48,940 --> 04:15:49,500
All right.

3664
04:15:49,500 --> 04:15:50,139
I'm a knight.

3665
04:15:52,280 --> 04:15:53,479
I've never played as the knight.

3666
04:15:56,709 --> 04:15:58,389
Let me string together two and three.

3667
04:15:58,389 --> 04:15:59,030
I just want two.

3668
04:15:59,670 --> 04:16:00,709
Two per round is good.

3669
04:16:01,270 --> 04:16:03,940
If it's even possible, it is.

3670
04:16:03,940 --> 04:16:05,940
But I don't like this map with this many people.

3671
04:16:06,579 --> 04:16:18,389
I blocked it.

3672
04:16:18,389 --> 04:16:27,510
Right in the head.

3673
04:16:27,510 --> 04:16:28,389
Keep that.

3674
04:16:28,389 --> 04:16:29,590
A guy needs one hit and he's dead.

3675
04:16:31,239 --> 04:16:31,959
We got more than them.

3676
04:16:31,959 --> 04:16:32,440
We got more.

3677
04:16:32,440 --> 04:16:32,840
Go in.

3678
04:16:32,840 --> 04:16:33,879
Go, go, go, go in.

3679
04:16:33,879 --> 04:16:34,280
Let's go.

3680
04:16:49,459 --> 04:16:50,180
No, no, no, no.

3681
04:16:50,180 --> 04:16:50,899
I'm in the fighting area.

3682
04:16:50,899 --> 04:16:51,700
What are you talking about?

3683
04:16:51,700 --> 04:17:02,940
Oh, fuck.

3684
04:17:02,940 --> 04:17:03,420
Oh, fuck.

3685
04:17:03,420 --> 04:17:10,139
No.

3686
04:17:10,139 --> 04:17:10,700
What?

3687
04:17:10,700 --> 04:17:11,799
That was...

3688
04:17:11,799 --> 04:17:13,450
This is bad.

3689
04:17:13,450 --> 04:17:21,500
I'm in trouble.

3690
04:17:22,299 --> 04:17:25,299
Oh, well.

3691
04:17:25,299 --> 04:17:28,979
They're gonna vote kick me?

3692
04:17:28,979 --> 04:17:31,940
Well, then they don't get to play anymore.

3693
04:17:31,940 --> 04:17:33,590
Because I'll go to a different server.

3694
04:17:33,590 --> 04:17:34,629
It's that simple.

3695
04:17:34,629 --> 04:17:48,260
The vote kick is real.

3696
04:17:48,260 --> 04:17:59,909
They can play without you.

3697
04:17:59,909 --> 04:18:04,219
You don't think they're gonna do that, do you?

3698
04:18:04,219 --> 04:18:05,500
Do you really believe that?

3699
04:18:05,500 --> 04:18:23,399
Do you really think

3700
04:18:23,399 --> 04:18:27,510
the guy that taunts every time

3701
04:18:27,510 --> 04:18:29,590
and runs through everybody to come find me

3702
04:18:29,590 --> 04:18:34,200
is gonna play a different server?

3703
04:18:34,200 --> 04:18:35,000
Hey, don't fall.

3704
04:18:51,670 --> 04:18:53,110
Do you really think that?

3705
04:18:53,110 --> 04:19:10,940
Oh, this is a bad place to be.

3706
04:19:10,940 --> 04:19:11,739
I don't want to be here.

3707
04:19:11,739 --> 04:19:27,819
Uh-oh.

3708
04:19:27,819 --> 04:19:28,540
Too many.

3709
04:19:28,540 --> 04:19:32,170
Oh, fuck.

3710
04:19:32,170 --> 04:19:32,649
Too many.

3711
04:19:32,649 --> 04:19:32,889
No.

3712
04:19:33,530 --> 04:19:59,049
Are they playing door pong?

3713
04:19:59,049 --> 04:20:04,629
Let's see how this ends.

3714
04:20:04,629 --> 04:20:11,209
How is this gonna end?

3715
04:20:11,209 --> 04:20:13,690
It ends with the squire killing both of them.

3716
04:20:13,690 --> 04:20:17,510
Watch.

3717
04:20:17,510 --> 04:20:18,149
Oops.

3718
04:20:18,149 --> 04:20:21,979
I don't even know what that was.

3719
04:20:27,100 --> 04:20:30,760
This game is fucking ridiculous.

3720
04:20:37,850 --> 04:20:38,569
That was, uh...

3721
04:20:40,700 --> 04:20:41,579
Oh, Sir Davos.

3722
04:20:42,139 --> 04:20:43,420
I'm not much of a fighter.

3723
04:20:43,420 --> 04:20:45,100
Apologize for what you're about to see.

3724
04:20:45,739 --> 04:20:52,219
You know, the Red Woman.

3725
04:20:52,219 --> 04:20:53,340
Get him, Davos.

3726
04:20:53,340 --> 04:21:07,500
Does Jerma only read your messages out loud if you insult him?

3727
04:21:07,500 --> 04:21:08,139
Yes.

3728
04:21:08,139 --> 04:21:12,700
Look at all that.

3729
04:21:12,700 --> 04:21:15,819
That team had like 40 combined stream sniper kills on me.

3730
04:21:15,819 --> 04:21:17,180
They were only killing me.

3731
04:21:17,180 --> 04:21:18,780
I was the only person to die.

3732
04:21:18,780 --> 04:21:20,620
Notice everybody on my team had zero deaths

3733
04:21:20,620 --> 04:21:21,899
and I had 48 deaths.

3734
04:21:22,459 --> 04:21:23,340
That's unfair.

3735
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:24,139
It shouldn't be like that.

3736
04:21:31,190 --> 04:21:32,149
I need to level up.

3737
04:21:32,149 --> 04:21:33,030
Why am I not getting any...

3738
04:21:33,350 --> 04:21:34,709
Did XP turn off again?

3739
04:21:43,610 --> 04:21:45,129
Jerma, you are a badass.

3740
04:21:45,129 --> 04:21:46,010
Hey, thanks.

3741
04:21:46,010 --> 04:21:46,969
That wasn't a mean comment.

3742
04:21:46,969 --> 04:21:48,090
I read it all up.

3743
04:21:48,090 --> 04:21:52,899
Try getting more kills than deaths.

3744
04:21:53,620 --> 04:21:56,659
I have like 12 kills and 48 deaths.

3745
04:21:57,379 --> 04:22:10,790
This is so much fun, though.

3746
04:22:10,790 --> 04:22:11,350
It really is.

3747
04:22:11,909 --> 04:22:16,549
I'm just gonna pretend that I'm Ned Stark and it's just ice.

3748
04:22:28,809 --> 04:22:29,690
Oops.

3749
04:22:29,690 --> 04:22:31,340
I thought I was still on the...

3750
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:32,139
Okay.

3751
04:22:32,139 --> 04:22:33,100
Well, Ned Stark did...

3752
04:22:33,819 --> 04:22:37,270
I made him...

3753
04:22:37,350 --> 04:22:45,510
I thought my last game was...

3754
04:22:50,299 --> 04:22:51,420
Died immediately.

3755
04:22:52,219 --> 04:23:10,059
Damn it.

3756
04:23:10,059 --> 04:23:11,020
I thought I was gonna faster.

3757
04:23:21,079 --> 04:23:22,760
Yeah, he wouldn't have been in the show for very long.

3758
04:23:41,399 --> 04:23:42,360
Somebody kill him.

3759
04:24:02,200 --> 04:24:03,399
God damn it.

3760
04:24:03,399 --> 04:24:13,700
Is somebody behind?

3761
04:24:13,700 --> 04:24:18,139
Oh, can you guess who that was?

3762
04:24:18,139 --> 04:24:21,559
I wonder how many of my deaths have been to that guy.

3763
04:24:21,559 --> 04:24:23,959
It's got to be at least like 30.

3764
04:24:23,959 --> 04:24:43,420
I'm going over here.

3765
04:24:43,420 --> 04:24:43,739
Kill!

3766
04:24:44,379 --> 04:24:50,360
Give me that.

3767
04:24:50,360 --> 04:25:06,979
An archer.

3768
04:25:06,979 --> 04:25:10,040
Can I pull the arrow out?

3769
04:25:10,040 --> 04:25:10,680
I can.

3770
04:25:10,680 --> 04:25:18,340
Uh-oh.

3771
04:25:18,340 --> 04:25:29,100
Guy on a horse.

3772
04:25:29,100 --> 04:25:29,420
Whoa!

3773
04:25:38,840 --> 04:25:40,280
No, I'm reconnected.

3774
04:25:40,280 --> 04:25:41,700
I think I'm back.

3775
04:25:41,700 --> 04:25:50,059
What's my favorite movie?

3776
04:25:50,059 --> 04:25:50,700
That's a tough one.

3777
04:25:50,700 --> 04:25:52,299
Ghostbusters or Gremlins 2.

3778
04:25:52,299 --> 04:25:56,440
That's a toss-up, though.

3779
04:25:56,440 --> 04:25:56,840
It's hard.

3780
04:26:14,040 --> 04:26:14,520
Nice.

3781
04:26:14,520 --> 04:26:14,840
Good.

3782
04:26:14,840 --> 04:26:26,389
Keep it going.

3783
04:26:26,389 --> 04:26:27,030
Holy shit!

3784
04:26:28,090 --> 04:26:28,649
Whoa!

3785
04:26:28,649 --> 04:26:29,370
Too many people.

3786
04:26:30,010 --> 04:26:30,889
Oh.

3787
04:26:30,889 --> 04:26:36,139
It's Back to the Future.

3788
04:26:36,139 --> 04:26:37,180
That's a good one, too.

3789
04:26:37,180 --> 04:26:40,260
There's a lot of good movies.

3790
04:26:40,260 --> 04:26:59,690
There really are.

3791
04:26:59,690 --> 04:27:00,329
Fuck.

3792
04:27:00,329 --> 04:27:11,420
Everyone's fighting this like pen over here.

3793
04:27:11,899 --> 04:27:22,260
Horizontal strike.

3794
04:27:22,260 --> 04:27:22,819
Right in the...

3795
04:27:22,819 --> 04:27:23,299
Never mind.

3796
04:27:27,370 --> 04:27:28,170
Aw.

3797
04:27:28,170 --> 04:27:35,260
Kill the archers.

3798
04:27:35,260 --> 04:27:35,659
That's a good...

3799
04:27:35,659 --> 04:27:36,700
You know, I'm going to run around.

3800
04:27:36,700 --> 04:27:39,879
I'll try to wrap it up and kill all archers.

3801
04:27:39,879 --> 04:27:44,379
I'll be on archer duty.

3802
04:27:44,379 --> 04:28:00,149
There's an archer!

3803
04:28:00,149 --> 04:28:02,569
We lost?

3804
04:28:02,569 --> 04:28:04,299
That's sad.

3805
04:28:04,299 --> 04:28:14,250
I'll kill the people that can't fight back.

3806
04:28:14,250 --> 04:28:14,809
What do you mean?

3807
04:28:14,809 --> 04:28:21,399
They've been fighting the whole time, shooting arrows at me.

3808
04:28:21,399 --> 04:28:21,879
Experience.

3809
04:28:21,879 --> 04:28:22,440
Come on, more.

3810
04:28:25,030 --> 04:28:25,829
No.

3811
04:28:25,829 --> 04:28:28,680
Why does it have to be shut off?

3812
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:28,920
All right.

3813
04:28:28,920 --> 04:28:30,200
I'm going to take a look at what I got.

3814
04:28:30,200 --> 04:28:31,079
Because I have money.

3815
04:28:31,079 --> 04:28:32,360
Let me go see what I have here.

3816
04:28:32,360 --> 04:28:36,819
I should be like eight or something by now.

3817
04:28:36,819 --> 04:28:45,530
Let's go down here.

3818
04:28:45,530 --> 04:28:46,649
How much money do I have?

3819
04:28:48,340 --> 04:28:49,540
Why am I not making any money?

3820
04:28:53,239 --> 04:28:55,639
I have not gotten any experience points and no money.

3821
04:28:55,639 --> 04:28:57,559
But did they turn it on and then turn it off again?

3822
04:28:58,120 --> 04:29:02,790
Because it was working for about 15 minutes.

3823
04:29:03,590 --> 04:29:04,069
Damn it.

3824
04:29:04,069 --> 04:29:04,469
Oh well.

3825
04:29:05,110 --> 04:29:07,379
All right.

3826
04:29:07,379 --> 04:29:08,579
Let's go somewhere else.

3827
04:29:08,579 --> 04:29:13,819
Play the tutorial for cash.

3828
04:29:14,620 --> 04:29:17,579
I tried that last time, but I'm assuming it's not going to work again.

3829
04:29:18,139 --> 04:29:22,260
Because the servers are not keeping up with what you're doing.

3830
04:29:22,260 --> 04:29:23,139
It probably won't work.

3831
04:29:23,860 --> 04:29:25,559
So no, it's all good.

3832
04:29:26,200 --> 04:29:27,340
We'll just join another one.

3833
04:29:28,059 --> 04:29:29,190
All right.

3834
04:29:29,190 --> 04:29:30,950
Something a little more low scale.

3835
04:29:34,680 --> 04:29:35,079
Like this.

3836
04:29:36,200 --> 04:29:36,520
Never mind.

3837
04:29:36,520 --> 04:29:38,120
This is called very horrible place.

3838
04:29:38,120 --> 04:29:39,000
I don't think I want to do that.

3839
04:29:40,170 --> 04:29:40,809
Team deathmatch.

3840
04:29:40,809 --> 04:29:41,610
Here we go.

3841
04:29:41,610 --> 04:29:53,020
Let's go try the night again.

3842
04:29:57,530 --> 04:30:01,129
Real gamers don't care about cosmetics or currency.

3843
04:30:01,930 --> 04:30:06,729
Well, you have to when it involves buying new weapons

3844
04:30:06,729 --> 04:30:08,090
that you can use in the game.

3845
04:30:08,809 --> 04:30:13,159
What are you going to do?

3846
04:30:13,159 --> 04:30:14,360
What are you going to do?

3847
04:30:14,360 --> 04:30:15,239
Punch me?

3848
04:30:15,239 --> 04:30:16,120
You're going to TK me?

3849
04:30:21,459 --> 04:30:22,260
All right.

3850
04:30:22,260 --> 04:30:22,739
Let's go.

3851
04:30:35,899 --> 04:30:38,059
I don't even know how the fuck I wrapped around you like this.

3852
04:30:40,500 --> 04:30:40,819
Kill.

3853
04:30:41,379 --> 04:30:43,180
Is it bleeding?

3854
04:30:48,500 --> 04:30:49,459
Uh, okay.

3855
04:30:58,899 --> 04:30:59,700
Delete OBS.

3856
04:31:02,469 --> 04:31:03,270
All right.

3857
04:31:03,270 --> 04:31:15,000
I'll show up behind you.

3858
04:31:17,209 --> 04:31:19,530
That was what I would consider a bop.

3859
04:31:27,129 --> 04:31:27,450
What?

3860
04:31:29,260 --> 04:31:29,979
What happened?

3861
04:31:29,979 --> 04:31:32,219
Did I jump directly into them?

3862
04:31:32,860 --> 04:31:34,409
That's the...

3863
04:31:34,409 --> 04:31:34,649
Okay.

3864
04:31:34,649 --> 04:31:36,969
I've been playing this game for almost four and a half hours.

3865
04:31:38,280 --> 04:31:43,510
And I've touched those spikes before and it didn't instantly kill me.

3866
04:31:50,780 --> 04:32:05,450
Uh-oh.

3867
04:32:05,450 --> 04:32:07,690
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3868
04:32:09,129 --> 04:32:14,280
I jumped face-first into them.

3869
04:32:14,280 --> 04:32:16,920
I thought they were just kind of there to be an annoyance.

3870
04:32:16,920 --> 04:32:19,639
I didn't know that you died if you touched them instantly.

3871
04:32:19,639 --> 04:32:22,549
It's the first time I've seen them work.

3872
04:32:30,229 --> 04:32:31,030
You killed them.

3873
04:32:31,030 --> 04:32:32,680
All right.

3874
04:32:32,680 --> 04:32:33,399
I'm going.

3875
04:32:33,399 --> 04:32:34,520
The bridge is just death.

3876
04:32:34,520 --> 04:32:35,719
They're all piled up on the bridge.

3877
04:32:47,610 --> 04:32:50,420
Was there anybody even around?

3878
04:32:50,979 --> 04:32:52,920
What the fuck?

3879
04:32:52,920 --> 04:32:58,629
I guess I've been behind me.

3880
04:32:59,190 --> 04:33:04,680
You're going down.

3881
04:33:05,240 --> 04:33:15,340
Through the hole.

3882
04:33:15,340 --> 04:33:15,740
Come on.

3883
04:33:18,759 --> 04:33:19,319
Right in the head.

3884
04:33:20,040 --> 04:33:20,759
I can't get that.

3885
04:33:21,319 --> 04:33:31,500
Get his loot.

3886
04:33:44,700 --> 04:33:45,580
Stab.

3887
04:33:45,580 --> 04:33:46,380
There it is.

3888
04:33:46,380 --> 04:33:46,860
All right.

3889
04:33:46,860 --> 04:34:03,240
Keep it up.

3890
04:34:03,240 --> 04:34:03,799
Rock.

3891
04:34:03,799 --> 04:34:18,220
Didn't think I was going to turn, did you?

3892
04:34:18,220 --> 04:34:19,020
Nice.

3893
04:34:19,020 --> 04:34:30,709
That guy dead?

3894
04:34:30,709 --> 04:34:31,270
Not yet.

3895
04:34:35,979 --> 04:34:36,619
Oh, great.

3896
04:34:37,560 --> 04:34:40,119
Well, oh well.

3897
04:34:40,119 --> 04:34:42,200
That was good spicy team attacks.

3898
04:34:42,200 --> 04:34:42,840
They were pretty good.

3899
04:34:47,419 --> 04:34:53,939
That guy looks like the ref.

3900
04:34:53,939 --> 04:34:54,659
I wonder if they...

3901
04:34:54,659 --> 04:35:01,619
Imagine if they had refs back then.

3902
04:35:01,619 --> 04:35:01,939
All right.

3903
04:35:01,939 --> 04:35:02,819
Don't touch those.

3904
04:35:02,819 --> 04:35:03,220
They're bad.

3905
04:35:06,259 --> 04:35:08,020
They did have a ref back then.

3906
04:35:08,020 --> 04:35:09,900
No, they didn't.

3907
04:35:09,900 --> 04:35:20,869
All right.

3908
04:35:20,869 --> 04:35:23,049
I got thrown the shit at me.

3909
04:35:23,049 --> 04:35:23,610
It's got to go.

3910
04:35:24,169 --> 04:35:30,040
I'm going to drop down.

3911
04:35:30,040 --> 04:35:30,919
I know it.

3912
04:35:30,919 --> 04:35:37,720
What do I have left?

3913
04:35:37,720 --> 04:35:44,840
One, two, three.

3914
04:35:45,639 --> 04:35:49,430
Well, that was dumb.

3915
04:35:49,990 --> 04:35:51,029
I didn't even click.

3916
04:35:51,029 --> 04:35:51,750
I didn't even click.

3917
04:35:51,750 --> 04:35:51,990
I swear.

3918
04:35:51,990 --> 04:35:52,709
I promise you.

3919
04:35:52,709 --> 04:35:53,669
I didn't click.

3920
04:35:53,669 --> 04:36:10,220
The guy with the fucking frying pan.

3921
04:36:17,939 --> 04:36:21,459
It's only so many times I can block the fucking attacks.

3922
04:36:21,459 --> 04:36:31,020
I got looted.

3923
04:36:31,020 --> 04:36:31,819
I did.

3924
04:36:31,819 --> 04:36:38,680
Oh, that guy got in the way.

3925
04:36:38,680 --> 04:36:48,939
This guy is fucking relentless.

3926
04:36:48,939 --> 04:37:04,889
Somebody behind me, right?

3927
04:37:04,889 --> 04:37:05,450
Goodbye.

3928
04:37:06,169 --> 04:37:08,840
He didn't see me in his peripheral.

3929
04:37:08,840 --> 04:37:29,689
But I did.

3930
04:37:29,689 --> 04:37:30,970
Oh, good.

3931
04:37:31,529 --> 04:37:32,169
Very good.

3932
04:37:33,479 --> 04:37:34,360
MVP.

3933
04:37:34,360 --> 04:37:49,939
Took his legs out.

3934
04:37:49,939 --> 04:37:50,979
Good work.

3935
04:37:50,979 --> 04:37:53,099
This is working like a team.

3936
04:37:53,099 --> 04:37:54,060
This is what it should look like.

3937
04:38:01,750 --> 04:38:01,990
No.

3938
04:38:02,950 --> 04:38:08,900
I'm going to bed now.

3939
04:38:08,900 --> 04:38:10,020
Can I get a good night beer?

3940
04:38:17,900 --> 04:38:27,830
I was going to do it right into the microphone,

3941
04:38:27,830 --> 04:38:28,950
but it's getting later.

3942
04:38:28,950 --> 04:38:29,590
I don't want to do that.

3943
04:38:33,110 --> 04:38:43,340
The referee got too close to the combat.

3944
04:38:43,340 --> 04:38:43,979
Watch it.

3945
04:38:43,979 --> 04:38:44,619
He's going.

3946
04:38:44,619 --> 04:38:46,060
I knew you were going to do that.

3947
04:38:46,060 --> 04:38:48,540
Is this going to be my first battle?

3948
04:39:08,169 --> 04:39:08,729
No.

3949
04:39:08,729 --> 04:39:09,450
Friend.

3950
04:39:09,450 --> 04:39:11,720
An annoying friend.

3951
04:39:12,540 --> 04:39:13,020
I'm dead.

3952
04:39:20,619 --> 04:39:21,580
Friendly friend.

3953
04:39:21,580 --> 04:39:23,500
Did I tap the button?

3954
04:39:23,500 --> 04:39:35,139
I think in my repost, isn't that what I'm doing?

3955
04:39:37,720 --> 04:39:39,240
It's like right after you swing, right?

3956
04:39:39,240 --> 04:39:39,799
After you block.

3957
04:39:41,639 --> 04:39:42,040
Like that.

3958
04:39:42,680 --> 04:39:43,799
I think I've been doing that.

3959
04:39:44,439 --> 04:39:59,830
He even tried turning the...

3960
04:39:59,830 --> 04:40:01,830
Yeah, but it's kind of...

3961
04:40:01,830 --> 04:40:03,430
My brain just wants to kill things.

3962
04:40:04,069 --> 04:40:12,229
No, I thought he wasn't going to pay attention to that.

3963
04:40:12,869 --> 04:40:23,159
Come on in.

3964
04:40:23,159 --> 04:40:24,680
Oh, he's got the bow, doesn't he?

3965
04:40:26,330 --> 04:40:26,810
See ya.

3966
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:30,779
Damn it.

3967
04:40:30,779 --> 04:40:31,770
Get the ref.

3968
04:40:41,450 --> 04:40:41,849
I missed.

3969
04:40:43,110 --> 04:40:44,150
Wow.

3970
04:40:44,150 --> 04:40:45,189
What did I hit him with?

3971
04:40:45,830 --> 04:40:47,880
I didn't hit him in the back of the head?

3972
04:40:48,520 --> 04:40:49,500
That was interesting.

3973
04:40:56,540 --> 04:40:57,659
Eventually we're going to have a fight.

3974
04:41:28,979 --> 04:41:29,299
No!

3975
04:41:29,939 --> 04:41:32,759
Oh, die!

3976
04:41:33,639 --> 04:41:44,659
I can't have 13, that's unlucky.

3977
04:41:44,659 --> 04:41:45,540
Seven minutes left.

3978
04:41:53,540 --> 04:41:54,500
In the fire.

3979
04:41:54,500 --> 04:42:06,889
I didn't get him.

3980
04:42:06,889 --> 04:42:10,540
Watch out behind.

3981
04:42:19,900 --> 04:42:23,110
The combo.

3982
04:42:23,110 --> 04:42:32,040
Nice cross.

3983
04:42:32,040 --> 04:42:33,240
Holy shit.

3984
04:42:33,240 --> 04:42:34,279
Oh, I think I...

3985
04:42:34,279 --> 04:42:35,860
Damn it.

3986
04:42:35,860 --> 04:42:37,060
Come on, I can't have 13 kills.

3987
04:42:37,060 --> 04:42:38,580
14 at least, or 15.

3988
04:42:38,580 --> 04:42:41,830
Is this game out?

3989
04:42:41,830 --> 04:42:43,189
No, oh yeah.

3990
04:42:43,189 --> 04:42:44,229
You can buy it right now.

3991
04:42:44,229 --> 04:42:45,619
Should be on the front page.

3992
04:42:57,130 --> 04:42:58,330
Hey, we did it!

3993
04:42:58,330 --> 04:43:02,090
I'm not on the losing team this time.

3994
04:43:02,090 --> 04:43:05,529
Yeah, as of right now the game is released, but it's kind of broken.

3995
04:43:05,529 --> 04:43:07,849
Progression is turned off.

3996
04:43:07,849 --> 04:43:11,560
The currency is turned off.

3997
04:43:11,560 --> 04:43:12,360
The game works.

3998
04:43:12,360 --> 04:43:13,880
Some of the servers have issues.

3999
04:43:20,819 --> 04:43:21,459
Damn it.

4000
04:43:21,459 --> 04:43:24,700
Re-turn it back on.

4001
04:43:24,700 --> 04:43:25,580
Turn it off, turn it on.

4002
04:43:25,580 --> 04:43:26,380
Will that work?

4003
04:43:26,380 --> 04:43:34,389
The game itself is a blast.

4004
04:43:34,389 --> 04:43:35,430
Oh yeah, no, it's awesome.

4005
04:43:38,279 --> 04:43:40,840
I wouldn't be playing it for this long if I didn't think it was great.

4006
04:43:40,840 --> 04:43:42,040
I've been playing for like five hours.

4007
04:43:42,040 --> 04:43:43,080
I think it's fantastic.

4008
04:43:43,080 --> 04:43:46,040
Who do I want to be?

4009
04:44:04,459 --> 04:44:05,180
I don't know.

4010
04:44:05,180 --> 04:44:13,669
All right, let's go.

4011
04:44:13,669 --> 04:44:17,979
The protector of the realm.

4012
04:44:17,979 --> 04:44:29,049
Is it behind me hitting me?

4013
04:44:29,049 --> 04:44:33,000
Fuck!

4014
04:44:33,000 --> 04:44:33,959
Too many.

4015
04:44:33,959 --> 04:44:34,520
There's a lot.

4016
04:44:35,240 --> 04:44:39,669
No, no way.

4017
04:44:39,669 --> 04:44:40,630
Too many.

4018
04:44:41,270 --> 04:44:46,200
Oh, this is not...

4019
04:44:46,200 --> 04:44:48,680
Okay, this is just spawning and I keep going.

4020
04:44:48,680 --> 04:44:52,700
It's right ahead.

4021
04:44:58,950 --> 04:45:00,790
Damn, they're like all the way back at our spawn.

4022
04:45:00,790 --> 04:45:06,490
Let's try the spear.

4023
04:45:08,009 --> 04:45:09,529
Actually try to use it this time.

4024
04:45:09,529 --> 04:45:17,319
Fuckin' hell.

4025
04:45:27,860 --> 04:45:32,700
Oh, this is bad.

4026
04:45:32,700 --> 04:45:33,900
I got a long weapon, man.

4027
04:45:33,900 --> 04:45:35,180
I could stay up here for a while.

4028
04:45:41,459 --> 04:45:50,779
God damn it.

4029
04:45:50,779 --> 04:45:51,740
Let's not do this.

4030
04:46:17,189 --> 04:46:22,340
Oh, we're getting so badly smoked right now.

4031
04:46:22,340 --> 04:46:36,009
Where'd you come from?

4032
04:46:36,009 --> 04:46:38,259
All right, I gotta be somebody else.

4033
04:46:38,340 --> 04:46:40,020
We just can't even leave our spawn.

4034
04:46:40,020 --> 04:46:52,790
Come here.

4035
04:46:52,790 --> 04:47:04,659
Damn it.

4036
04:47:04,659 --> 04:47:05,779
Leave me alone.

4037
04:47:15,750 --> 04:47:21,779
Nobody on my team has more than three kills.

4038
04:47:21,779 --> 04:47:31,080
Kicking is good,

4039
04:47:31,080 --> 04:47:33,560
but when there's three or four people around you,

4040
04:47:33,560 --> 04:47:35,270
you can't really do it.

4041
04:47:35,270 --> 04:47:56,090
No.

4042
04:47:56,090 --> 04:47:56,569
Damn it.

4043
04:48:23,029 --> 04:48:24,310
I made you two.

4044
04:48:24,310 --> 04:48:50,619
There's no fighting them.

4045
04:48:50,619 --> 04:49:06,779
Finally, one like ant came out too far out of the nest.

4046
04:49:06,779 --> 04:49:07,580
We got him.

4047
04:49:07,580 --> 04:49:32,040
Our like shitty ant colony finally killed one ant.

4048
04:49:32,759 --> 04:49:40,340
Laugh at that.

4049
04:49:40,340 --> 04:49:42,099
You son of a bitch.

4050
04:49:43,430 --> 04:49:44,549
I got him.

4051
04:49:44,549 --> 04:50:00,279
Oops, I'm sorry.

4052
04:50:00,279 --> 04:50:01,159
I didn't mean to do that.

4053
04:50:01,159 --> 04:50:01,880
I was trying to click.

4054
04:50:01,880 --> 04:50:02,279
I'm sorry.

4055
04:50:02,279 --> 04:50:03,479
I didn't mean to.

4056
04:50:03,479 --> 04:50:12,540
I'm trying to do it again.

4057
04:50:13,099 --> 04:50:15,259
I'm trying to kick that fucking guy up again.

4058
04:50:31,770 --> 04:50:41,830
Do you ever press X then two?

4059
04:50:49,459 --> 04:50:50,740
Why is that a thing?

4060
04:50:51,540 --> 04:50:51,860
What?

4061
04:50:52,919 --> 04:50:55,159
I accidentally hit my own buddy in the face.

4062
04:51:22,169 --> 04:51:23,049
Oh my god.

4063
04:51:30,650 --> 04:51:32,090
No, no, no, no, no.

4064
04:51:49,299 --> 04:51:50,099
Kill.

4065
04:51:50,099 --> 04:51:50,419
Kill.

4066
04:51:52,259 --> 04:51:53,220
Oh, hello, sir.

4067
04:52:05,819 --> 04:52:07,299
Zero health.

4068
04:52:07,299 --> 04:52:08,020
Almost.

4069
04:52:08,020 --> 04:52:17,779
I'm just getting fucking destroyed.

4070
04:52:17,779 --> 04:52:19,619
I want to kick more people off the edge.

4071
04:52:19,619 --> 04:52:19,939
No.

4072
04:52:20,659 --> 04:52:28,819
I got it.

4073
04:52:28,819 --> 04:52:29,380
Plus one.

4074
04:52:29,939 --> 04:52:30,979
One damage.

4075
04:52:30,979 --> 04:53:00,020
It took like five people.

4076
04:53:00,020 --> 04:53:00,740
What the fuck?

4077
04:53:00,740 --> 04:53:01,700
Oh my god, my...

4078
04:53:01,700 --> 04:53:02,659
Oh my god.

4079
04:53:02,659 --> 04:53:03,700
Oh my god, what do I do?

4080
04:53:03,700 --> 04:53:16,919
All right.

4081
04:53:16,919 --> 04:53:17,880
I want to try...

4082
04:53:17,880 --> 04:53:22,069
I want to try the actual VR again.

4083
04:53:22,069 --> 04:53:23,590
I want to see if I can actually do it.

4084
04:53:23,590 --> 04:53:24,389
Is it...

4085
04:53:24,389 --> 04:53:25,430
Can we do it?

4086
04:53:25,430 --> 04:53:46,580
This is where it begins.

4087
04:53:49,029 --> 04:53:49,669
I gotta pee too.

4088
04:53:49,669 --> 04:54:00,919
I haven't peed once today, have I?

4089
04:54:00,919 --> 04:54:01,560
No, I haven't.

4090
04:54:13,180 --> 04:54:14,220
That's a first.

4091
04:54:14,220 --> 04:54:16,299
I don't think I've done that in a long time.

4092
04:54:16,299 --> 04:54:25,930
It's been a while since I've not had to pee for like five hours.

4093
04:54:25,930 --> 04:54:28,250
I did pee right before the stream started though.

4094
04:54:28,250 --> 04:54:32,099
Should I go pee right now?

4095
04:54:32,099 --> 04:54:32,900
Okay, I'm gonna go pee...

4096
04:54:32,900 --> 04:54:34,020
I'm gonna go as fast as I can.

4097
04:54:34,659 --> 04:54:36,569
I'm gonna get some water.

4098
04:54:36,569 --> 04:54:37,450
I'll be right back.

4099
04:54:38,340 --> 04:54:44,389
Hopefully by the time I get back in here, we'll see.

4100
04:54:45,110 --> 04:54:47,860
All right, I'll be right back.

4101
04:54:48,500 --> 04:54:48,979
Okay, bye.

4102
04:54:49,540 --> 04:57:42,200
Did I get in?

4103
04:57:42,200 --> 04:57:47,720
No, I'm still looking.

4104
04:57:50,099 --> 04:57:51,299
Oh, really?

4105
04:57:55,500 --> 04:57:56,220
This would be fun.

4106
04:57:56,860 --> 04:58:01,270
Quick drawing does not work.

4107
04:58:02,299 --> 04:58:02,779
Oh.

4108
04:58:02,779 --> 04:58:04,680
Well, that's unfortunate.

4109
04:58:05,240 --> 04:58:12,169
Sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes to find a match.

4110
04:58:15,450 --> 04:58:17,130
Is it just because they're all full?

4111
04:58:17,130 --> 04:58:19,560
And a ton of people are trying to join at the same time?

4112
04:58:23,099 --> 04:58:24,459
This has been okay recently.

4113
04:58:30,540 --> 04:58:33,020
You can't select Battle Royale.

4114
04:58:33,020 --> 04:58:33,419
I see.

4115
04:58:38,250 --> 04:58:39,369
Well, shit.

4116
04:58:39,369 --> 04:58:46,659
All right, let's go...

4117
04:58:49,830 --> 04:58:50,630
Server.

4118
04:58:50,630 --> 04:58:57,959
Five out of six.

4119
04:58:57,959 --> 04:58:59,080
That's a little one.

4120
04:58:59,080 --> 04:59:02,549
Maybe we should do a little one.

4121
04:59:03,430 --> 04:59:09,049
It's Horde.

4122
04:59:09,049 --> 04:59:12,889
Horde would be fun with an actual five or six people you know.

4123
04:59:15,580 --> 04:59:18,779
Here's Battle Royale right here.

4124
04:59:18,779 --> 04:59:19,740
Can I just join this?

4125
04:59:23,990 --> 04:59:25,590
I guess so.

4126
04:59:25,590 --> 04:59:30,740
Interesting.

4127
04:59:31,299 --> 04:59:34,060
I think so.

4128
04:59:43,099 --> 04:59:46,090
Hide the server browser.

4129
04:59:46,090 --> 04:59:49,209
Yeah, but there's really nothing you can do about it.

4130
04:59:49,209 --> 04:59:55,099
Because, I mean, it's not that hard in an attempt of me to hide the server.

4131
04:59:55,979 --> 04:59:59,020
I mean, how many VR games are currently running right now, you know?

4132
04:59:59,020 --> 05:00:00,680
It wouldn't be that difficult to find it.

4133
05:00:01,400 --> 05:00:12,520
Hi-yah!

4134
05:00:12,840 --> 05:00:21,830
This might even be the only Battle Royale server that's on, like, U.S. West.

4135
05:00:22,549 --> 05:00:24,069
That has players accepting it.

4136
05:00:24,069 --> 05:00:25,349
So it's like, hey, I'm in VR!

4137
05:00:26,459 --> 05:00:27,419
No, unless you had...

4138
05:00:27,419 --> 05:00:29,259
Unless matchmaking works, that's not gonna happen.

4139
05:00:33,029 --> 05:00:33,990
Life is bald.

4140
05:00:37,509 --> 05:00:38,950
Old guy versus young guy.

4141
05:00:38,950 --> 05:00:40,779
Who do you think?

4142
05:00:40,779 --> 05:00:42,060
I think young guy's gonna pull through.

4143
05:00:43,099 --> 05:00:45,659
Old guy has the upper hand now, but I think young guy's gonna throw a few punches here

4144
05:00:45,659 --> 05:00:46,459
and knock him out with one hit.

4145
05:00:47,659 --> 05:00:48,619
I'm commentating.

4146
05:00:48,619 --> 05:00:51,580
You don't come attack the guy broadcasting the game.

4147
05:00:52,139 --> 05:00:53,500
I'm broadcasting the fight.

4148
05:00:53,500 --> 05:00:54,700
Why would you punch me in the face?

4149
05:01:00,220 --> 05:01:01,099
You punched the ref.

4150
05:01:01,099 --> 05:01:01,900
No, not even the ref.

4151
05:01:01,900 --> 05:01:04,380
I'm the guy with the microphone in the ring that wants an interview.

4152
05:01:04,939 --> 05:01:13,029
Can you die by that?

4153
05:01:13,029 --> 05:01:13,669
Quick, quick, quick.

4154
05:01:13,669 --> 05:01:15,669
Three, two, one!

4155
05:01:15,669 --> 05:01:17,430
Ah, all right, I need something.

4156
05:01:23,900 --> 05:01:24,619
Come on, anything.

4157
05:01:25,580 --> 05:01:26,380
Can I pick the horse up?

4158
05:01:27,099 --> 05:01:29,340
Can I hear horse, weapon, chest?

4159
05:01:29,979 --> 05:01:35,340
All right, I got a maul and a branch and a mace.

4160
05:01:35,340 --> 05:01:35,900
That's a lot.

4161
05:01:36,700 --> 05:01:37,500
No, don't use the branch.

4162
05:01:37,500 --> 05:01:38,060
Use the maul.

4163
05:01:45,259 --> 05:01:52,060
My game environment is being compromised!

4164
05:02:14,759 --> 05:02:18,119
My game environment is being toyed with!

4165
05:02:22,310 --> 05:02:31,349
All right, this isn't gonna last for more than 15 seconds.

4166
05:02:31,349 --> 05:03:02,869
I hope you know that.

4167
05:03:02,869 --> 05:03:15,080
Someone else's gamer gunk is in my gamer zone!

4168
05:03:15,080 --> 05:03:15,720
All right, here we go.

4169
05:03:26,709 --> 05:03:27,990
Nobody can know who I am now.

4170
05:03:27,990 --> 05:03:43,830
Is this free for all?

4171
05:03:43,830 --> 05:03:46,040
I think so.

4172
05:04:03,799 --> 05:04:04,279
Damn it!

4173
05:04:19,590 --> 05:04:19,909
What?

4174
05:04:31,659 --> 05:04:32,060
What?

4175
05:04:39,259 --> 05:04:51,659
Packet loss, packet loss.

4176
05:04:51,659 --> 05:04:52,860
Oh, that's far.

4177
05:04:52,860 --> 05:05:02,299
That one's gonna come behind me, aren't they?

4178
05:05:02,299 --> 05:05:04,619
Damn it, I was so paranoid about somebody being behind me.

4179
05:05:04,619 --> 05:05:10,900
I don't know if it's Raider anymore.

4180
05:05:10,900 --> 05:05:14,200
I think I was having more...

4181
05:05:15,740 --> 05:05:17,900
Gamer fatigue also is probably settling in here.

4182
05:05:17,900 --> 05:05:28,279
Right in the head.

4183
05:05:28,279 --> 05:05:30,220
There's a naked guy.

4184
05:05:31,860 --> 05:05:32,340
Come on.

4185
05:05:32,900 --> 05:05:35,110
Come on, give me one of these.

4186
05:05:38,180 --> 05:05:39,459
Gamer fucking fatigue, man.

4187
05:05:40,580 --> 05:05:44,439
I just had the one zone I was going.

4188
05:05:44,439 --> 05:05:45,319
Good, I wanted to do that

4189
05:05:45,319 --> 05:05:47,240
because now I can play the class I want to play with.

4190
05:05:47,240 --> 05:06:15,029
Turned all the way around.

4191
05:06:15,029 --> 05:06:16,389
Let's watch the stamina.

4192
05:06:31,639 --> 05:06:32,360
Two!

4193
05:06:32,360 --> 05:06:45,080
Stamina, 100%.

4194
05:06:45,080 --> 05:06:46,360
Don't tell him I'm behind him.

4195
05:06:48,299 --> 05:06:49,020
Speaking of which...

4196
05:06:55,990 --> 05:06:56,630
Damn it.

4197
05:07:01,020 --> 05:07:13,299
That's not gonna kill me, right?

4198
05:07:13,299 --> 05:07:14,099
Jump!

4199
05:07:14,099 --> 05:07:22,700
Somebody behind you, somebody behind you!

4200
05:07:22,700 --> 05:07:25,369
That was not honorable.

4201
05:07:25,369 --> 05:07:38,340
Although I do it all the time.

4202
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:41,849
Wow, that hurt.

4203
05:07:41,849 --> 05:07:42,250
Fuck!

4204
05:07:43,290 --> 05:07:44,169
He outplayed me there.

4205
05:07:44,169 --> 05:07:45,450
I was gonna debate...

4206
05:07:45,450 --> 05:07:49,619
I was gonna debate him.

4207
05:07:49,619 --> 05:07:50,259
You got...

4208
05:07:50,259 --> 05:07:51,299
No, you do your thing, do your thing.

4209
05:07:51,299 --> 05:07:52,819
I won't get involved.

4210
05:07:52,819 --> 05:08:20,200
Are we playing a game or are we having a picnic, fellas?

4211
05:08:20,200 --> 05:08:27,049
He blocked it.

4212
05:08:29,060 --> 05:08:29,939
Oh, he's stuck.

4213
05:08:29,939 --> 05:08:30,259
Okay.

4214
05:08:32,229 --> 05:08:34,419
Well, let's help him.

4215
05:08:34,979 --> 05:08:39,860
Did I die by the...

4216
05:08:39,860 --> 05:08:42,340
Oh, by Dothmal killed me?

4217
05:08:42,340 --> 05:08:52,380
Didn't think I was gonna do that.

4218
05:08:52,380 --> 05:08:53,180
Do you like that move?

4219
05:08:53,180 --> 05:08:56,459
I call that one the 1v1 lock-on technique.

4220
05:08:56,459 --> 05:08:56,959
Ready?

4221
05:09:15,509 --> 05:09:16,310
Thanks for the...

4222
05:09:16,310 --> 05:09:17,349
Thanks for the Band-Aid.

4223
05:09:17,909 --> 05:09:19,349
Oh, that was fucking ridiculous.

4224
05:09:19,909 --> 05:09:31,779
Oh, fuck!

4225
05:09:31,779 --> 05:09:32,979
I forgot you had those.

4226
05:09:32,979 --> 05:09:49,860
I can't...

4227
05:09:49,860 --> 05:09:51,220
I can't block with a Band-Aid?

4228
05:09:51,220 --> 05:09:52,740
What the hell am I thinking?

4229
05:09:52,740 --> 05:09:57,110
I'm trying to block with Band-Aids in my hands.

4230
05:09:57,110 --> 05:09:59,880
It's made out of cloth.

4231
05:09:59,880 --> 05:10:01,720
I'm not sure you're aware of that, Jeremy.

4232
05:10:01,720 --> 05:10:44,470
Oh, he's back.

4233
05:10:44,470 --> 05:10:47,930
Oh, good fake!

4234
05:10:47,930 --> 05:10:48,490
No!

4235
05:10:48,490 --> 05:10:56,229
The new D group keep looks really good.

4236
05:10:56,229 --> 05:10:59,849
The game is really fun.

4237
05:11:10,180 --> 05:11:11,380
Ha ha ha.

4238
05:11:11,380 --> 05:11:12,099
And I just got...

4239
05:11:12,099 --> 05:11:14,099
I aggroed both of them by doing that.

4240
05:11:14,099 --> 05:11:32,680
1v1 server...

4241
05:11:32,680 --> 05:11:33,560
Wait, am I...

4242
05:11:33,560 --> 05:11:34,439
It just says deathmatch.

4243
05:11:34,439 --> 05:11:35,639
Wait, am I ruining everything?

4244
05:11:42,520 --> 05:11:44,759
Other people are doing that to me, though.

4245
05:11:44,759 --> 05:11:45,240
Wait, wait.

4246
05:11:45,240 --> 05:11:50,599
Everybody is doing that to each other.

4247
05:11:50,599 --> 05:11:51,319
Wait, hold on.

4248
05:11:52,869 --> 05:11:55,430
I've been attacked from behind like five times.

4249
05:11:55,430 --> 05:11:56,709
It's because I started it?

4250
05:11:57,669 --> 05:11:58,869
That's not what happened, right?

4251
05:11:59,860 --> 05:12:03,990
I'm not the bad guy here, am I?

4252
05:12:03,990 --> 05:12:04,549
See?

4253
05:12:04,549 --> 05:12:05,049
Look.

4254
05:12:10,869 --> 05:12:11,270
Look at...

4255
05:12:11,270 --> 05:12:13,110
Say that with 1v1 server.

4256
05:12:13,110 --> 05:12:13,750
Yeah, okay.

4257
05:12:15,529 --> 05:12:17,049
I didn't...

4258
05:12:21,369 --> 05:12:22,009
If that's...

4259
05:12:22,009 --> 05:12:22,569
No way.

4260
05:12:23,750 --> 05:12:24,709
They didn't learn it from me.

4261
05:12:24,709 --> 05:12:27,189
They have the servers been running for like four days.

4262
05:12:30,389 --> 05:12:31,830
Look, I'm observing right now.

4263
05:12:31,830 --> 05:12:32,950
They're all just fighting each other.

4264
05:12:34,540 --> 05:12:36,380
They're just wildly swinging at each other.

4265
05:12:37,020 --> 05:12:39,209
That guy's got double frying pan.

4266
05:12:48,540 --> 05:12:50,139
I'm not listening to you guys about that.

4267
05:12:50,779 --> 05:12:53,700
Uh-uh.

4268
05:12:53,700 --> 05:12:55,459
It's just a fight each other server.

4269
05:12:55,459 --> 05:12:57,860
It's not about 1v1ing.

4270
05:13:05,380 --> 05:13:07,560
Oh, that was a big hit.

4271
05:13:07,560 --> 05:13:10,729
This is an RP server.

4272
05:13:10,729 --> 05:13:11,529
I'm doing it wrong.

4273
05:13:26,169 --> 05:13:33,740
Ooh, all right.

4274
05:13:33,740 --> 05:13:34,619
Oh, I bled to death.

4275
05:13:34,619 --> 05:13:35,099
Fuck.

4276
05:13:35,099 --> 05:13:36,090
He beat me.

4277
05:13:37,419 --> 05:13:39,909
Ah.

4278
05:13:39,909 --> 05:13:40,389
Oh.

4279
05:13:40,389 --> 05:13:43,270
That didn't just spawn right there, did it?

4280
05:13:47,450 --> 05:13:48,009
It's okay.

4281
05:13:48,009 --> 05:13:48,889
I made it.

4282
05:13:48,889 --> 05:13:51,209
I made it to the fray.

4283
05:13:51,209 --> 05:14:11,900
Where is he?

4284
05:14:11,900 --> 05:14:12,939
What the hell was that?

4285
05:14:14,709 --> 05:14:16,150
He like tripped over a few things.

4286
05:14:36,090 --> 05:14:38,470
Nice.

4287
05:14:38,470 --> 05:14:39,189
Ooh, here he is.

4288
05:14:41,340 --> 05:14:42,380
He doesn't have a sword.

4289
05:14:42,380 --> 05:14:55,610
What?

4290
05:14:55,610 --> 05:14:56,090
Nice.

4291
05:15:12,700 --> 05:15:13,659
Ooh.

4292
05:15:13,659 --> 05:15:21,159
Wait, no, I'm alive.

4293
05:15:21,159 --> 05:15:22,520
I got a Coke ad?

4294
05:15:22,520 --> 05:15:23,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

4295
05:15:23,400 --> 05:15:25,180
Unless you don't...

4296
05:15:25,180 --> 05:15:26,139
Unless you like Coke.

4297
05:15:26,139 --> 05:15:26,700
I don't know, whatever.

4298
05:15:26,700 --> 05:15:37,610
Can I get a...

4299
05:15:37,610 --> 05:15:38,810
I took it back.

4300
05:15:40,250 --> 05:15:47,560
Oh, that's...

4301
05:15:51,740 --> 05:15:54,540
This game is fucking so funny.

4302
05:15:54,540 --> 05:15:57,779
Oh, he didn't even know.

4303
05:15:57,779 --> 05:16:12,040
I'm just gonna wait for it to happen.

4304
05:16:12,040 --> 05:16:13,479
I don't even care if I didn't get the kill.

4305
05:16:26,810 --> 05:16:27,849
Ooh, watch out.

4306
05:16:28,409 --> 05:16:38,580
Ooh, that was a double bait.

4307
05:16:45,909 --> 05:16:46,470
Holy shit.

4308
05:16:46,470 --> 05:16:47,669
Did you actually hit that?

4309
05:16:47,669 --> 05:16:53,580
Fuck, too early.

4310
05:16:53,580 --> 05:16:54,540
I'm taking him down with me.

4311
05:16:55,099 --> 05:17:01,990
He's got three pans.

4312
05:17:01,990 --> 05:17:09,799
All right, you and me, let's do it.

4313
05:17:11,939 --> 05:17:12,340
Honorable.

4314
05:17:12,340 --> 05:17:13,380
We'll do it honorably.

4315
05:17:13,380 --> 05:17:34,090
Oh, he's like spinning.

4316
05:17:34,090 --> 05:17:35,130
He's doing like a weird thing where he's...

4317
05:17:35,130 --> 05:17:37,099
Oh god, I'm dead.

4318
05:17:37,099 --> 05:17:38,060
No, don't fuck this up.

4319
05:17:38,060 --> 05:17:38,860
Ah.

4320
05:17:38,860 --> 05:17:41,180
He was like turning his back all the way.

4321
05:17:41,819 --> 05:17:43,110
He was going like this.

4322
05:17:43,110 --> 05:17:43,430
It was weird.

4323
05:17:43,430 --> 05:17:44,310
It's like throwing you off.

4324
05:17:44,310 --> 05:17:44,950
He goes like...

4325
05:17:45,590 --> 05:17:46,549
And then wraps around.

4326
05:17:46,549 --> 05:17:48,310
He like spins his back this way and then turns.

4327
05:17:49,029 --> 05:17:50,380
That's a pretty good tactic.

4328
05:17:51,099 --> 05:18:26,330
Rematch.

4329
05:18:26,330 --> 05:18:26,810
What?

4330
05:18:26,810 --> 05:18:36,680
Good job.

4331
05:18:36,680 --> 05:18:39,900
The spin doesn't do anything.

4332
05:18:41,419 --> 05:18:42,220
It's just a little...

4333
05:18:42,220 --> 05:18:43,180
Awfully.

4334
05:18:43,180 --> 05:18:47,669
I wish I could make some money.

4335
05:18:47,669 --> 05:18:49,110
The worst part about this is

4336
05:18:49,110 --> 05:18:53,130
not being able to unlock more weapons.

4337
05:18:53,130 --> 05:18:54,330
But I'll do...

4338
05:18:54,330 --> 05:18:59,580
I'll do like another two or three matches.

4339
05:18:59,580 --> 05:19:00,619
And then tomorrow we'll do...

4340
05:19:01,500 --> 05:19:04,459
Re-launch the game.

4341
05:19:04,459 --> 05:19:06,299
I did that before and it only worked for like...

4342
05:19:06,540 --> 05:19:07,340
Five minutes.

4343
05:19:07,340 --> 05:19:15,209
So we'll probably...

4344
05:19:15,209 --> 05:19:16,169
What we'll do tomorrow...

4345
05:19:16,169 --> 05:19:18,490
We'll finish Sam and Max season one tomorrow.

4346
05:19:18,490 --> 05:19:25,430
That's probably what will happen.

4347
05:19:25,430 --> 05:19:26,650
Because it was...

4348
05:19:26,650 --> 05:19:28,250
That it's about like five or six hours, right?

4349
05:19:36,229 --> 05:19:36,709
Same thing.

4350
05:19:37,270 --> 05:19:38,389
How do I 1v1 with a...

4351
05:19:54,180 --> 05:19:54,740
Head?

4352
05:19:54,740 --> 05:20:07,770
He dropped a bandage for you.

4353
05:20:07,770 --> 05:20:09,130
Is that what happened in my...

4354
05:20:09,130 --> 05:20:19,369
No, stop this.

4355
05:20:19,369 --> 05:20:29,430
Why am I doing this?

4356
05:20:29,430 --> 05:20:31,430
Gun game would actually be pretty cool here.

4357
05:20:31,430 --> 05:20:35,479
If they started you off with like the little potato knife.

4358
05:20:35,479 --> 05:20:40,229
Be the guy with the frying pan.

4359
05:20:40,229 --> 05:20:40,790
I can't.

4360
05:20:40,790 --> 05:20:42,229
I don't have a frying pan.

4361
05:20:42,229 --> 05:20:47,479
Now, are you ready?

4362
05:20:48,700 --> 05:20:49,740
Do we have to do this honorably?

4363
05:20:49,740 --> 05:20:50,700
Are we doing this?

4364
05:20:51,020 --> 05:20:51,819
Who's doing this?

4365
05:20:51,819 --> 05:20:54,139
Wait, wait, wait.

4366
05:20:54,139 --> 05:20:55,500
You both can't just come in at the same time.

4367
05:20:57,189 --> 05:20:58,229
Oh no!

4368
05:21:02,090 --> 05:21:02,889
Hey!

4369
05:21:02,889 --> 05:21:05,369
That's me from an hour ago.

4370
05:21:05,369 --> 05:21:06,810
I honorably would have...

4371
05:21:06,810 --> 05:21:08,630
You want a 1v1?

4372
05:21:08,630 --> 05:21:09,590
Is that what you want?

4373
05:21:09,590 --> 05:21:10,790
Is that what you want so bad?

4374
05:21:11,349 --> 05:21:19,590
I don't want to fight.

4375
05:21:19,590 --> 05:21:21,349
You're like so good at the game.

4376
05:21:24,979 --> 05:21:25,939
What do you want me to do?

4377
05:21:26,759 --> 05:21:28,680
How many hours do you have in this game?

4378
05:21:28,680 --> 05:21:46,659
How many days have you been playing all day?

4379
05:21:46,659 --> 05:21:47,860
Aim for the legs.

4380
05:21:47,860 --> 05:22:00,299
Dragging is the reason I didn't get into chivalry yet.

4381
05:22:00,299 --> 05:22:02,060
This feels slower than chivalry though.

4382
05:22:02,060 --> 05:22:02,619
This feels...

4383
05:22:03,259 --> 05:22:06,330
A chivalry was a little quicker, I think.

4384
05:22:06,330 --> 05:22:07,299
From what I remember.

4385
05:22:13,479 --> 05:22:13,799
I don't know.

4386
05:22:13,799 --> 05:22:14,759
I don't know when to go in.

4387
05:22:14,759 --> 05:22:35,990
I think I'm going in now.

4388
05:22:35,990 --> 05:22:37,290
Got panned.

4389
05:22:37,290 --> 05:22:39,290
Yeah, I gotta take a break too.

4390
05:22:39,290 --> 05:22:40,490
I've been playing for too long.

4391
05:22:40,490 --> 05:22:48,939
It's kind of blending together like it usually does.

4392
05:23:10,759 --> 05:23:12,439
I guess I'll do pan guy version two.

4393
05:23:17,049 --> 05:23:19,209
I didn't expect to kill that guy instantly.

4394
05:23:31,340 --> 05:23:31,979
Top of each other.

4395
05:23:31,979 --> 05:23:33,340
I didn't think that was gonna happen.

4396
05:23:33,340 --> 05:23:35,740
All right, another guy with a pan?

4397
05:23:35,740 --> 05:23:37,259
Are we doing pan three?

4398
05:23:37,259 --> 05:23:38,540
Okay, pan three.

4399
05:23:38,540 --> 05:23:39,580
No, this is not pan three.

4400
05:23:50,680 --> 05:23:59,700
How long is this map?

4401
05:23:59,700 --> 05:24:08,150
Oh, it's short, so we'll try it.

4402
05:24:13,419 --> 05:24:15,020
I thought for some reason that guy was gonna come in behind.

4403
05:24:15,580 --> 05:24:31,029
Who?

4404
05:24:31,029 --> 05:24:31,909
Who's coming in?

4405
05:24:31,909 --> 05:24:32,470
You?

4406
05:24:32,470 --> 05:24:34,540
Let's go.

4407
05:25:07,099 --> 05:25:08,779
You fight with disorder!

4408
05:25:26,889 --> 05:25:27,529
All right.

4409
05:25:27,529 --> 05:25:31,110
I think I gotta take a break from this game.

4410
05:25:31,110 --> 05:25:36,619
I need a mental break from five and a half hours straight of swinging swords at people.

4411
05:25:44,439 --> 05:25:45,479
We'll probably just hang out.

4412
05:25:45,479 --> 05:25:48,569
We'll hang out for like a half an hour.

4413
05:25:48,569 --> 05:25:51,799
Just chill.

4414
05:25:54,069 --> 05:25:55,990
And then tomorrow I'm gonna bring you...

4415
05:25:58,759 --> 05:25:59,799
Sam and Max.

4416
05:26:01,400 --> 05:26:02,439
Episode three.

4417
05:26:02,439 --> 05:26:05,689
We were in the middle of it, so we're gonna finish it.

4418
05:26:05,689 --> 05:26:15,880
Will I stream Mordhau again?

4419
05:26:17,080 --> 05:26:17,799
Once it works.

4420
05:26:18,520 --> 05:26:19,400
Completely.

4421
05:26:19,400 --> 05:26:25,580
I'd probably jump in here with some friends and do the horde mode.

4422
05:26:25,580 --> 05:26:31,110
Because there really is only so much of no progression that...

4423
05:26:34,340 --> 05:26:36,819
And like buggy servers not being able to do matchmaking.

4424
05:26:38,970 --> 05:26:39,849
You know.

4425
05:26:39,849 --> 05:26:46,580
So I am going to say goodbye for now.

4426
05:26:46,580 --> 05:26:51,540
For those of you that wanted to watch this game.

4427
05:26:52,099 --> 05:26:59,450
But for those of you sticking around, I'm just gonna chill.

4428
05:27:01,689 --> 05:27:02,810
We'll just hang out.

4429
05:27:02,810 --> 05:27:03,930
Probably do the bits too.

4430
05:27:03,930 --> 05:27:05,290
Just hanging out talking about stuff.

4431
05:27:09,099 --> 05:27:12,759
And I'll see you tomorrow if you're leaving for Sam and Max episode three.

4432
05:27:12,759 --> 05:27:15,000
And probably episode four and episode five.

4433
05:27:15,000 --> 05:27:17,340
Would you recommend this game?

4434
05:27:17,340 --> 05:27:18,139
Oh yeah, definitely.

4435
05:27:20,220 --> 05:27:23,740
Once all the bugs and everything are ironed out, this is gonna be a great game.

4436
05:27:23,740 --> 05:27:26,299
I mean it already is a great game, so yes.

4437
05:27:27,270 --> 05:27:32,330
Definitely.

4438
05:27:32,330 --> 05:27:34,330
Uh, I'm gonna get one more water though.

4439
05:27:34,330 --> 05:27:36,810
I'm like sweating in here.

4440
05:27:38,380 --> 05:27:41,459
Give me one second while I get a water.

4441
05:27:41,459 --> 05:27:42,580
And we'll come back and just chill.

4442
05:27:43,590 --> 05:27:44,470
See you very soon.

4443
05:31:17,110 --> 05:31:17,610
Okay.

4444
05:31:22,340 --> 05:31:26,520
What can I just put on the screen while we hang out and do bits?

4445
05:31:28,250 --> 05:31:32,979
I don't know.

4446
05:31:32,979 --> 05:31:34,419
Oh no, no GeoGuessr.

4447
05:31:38,310 --> 05:31:39,430
No GeoGuessr tonight.

4448
05:31:45,430 --> 05:31:47,590
Maybe we will just do the bits and call it.

4449
05:31:50,500 --> 05:31:52,180
That'll be just probably at about six hours.

4450
05:31:52,180 --> 05:31:53,060
Which is, that's fine.

4451
05:31:53,860 --> 05:31:54,419
That's good.

4452
05:32:00,939 --> 05:32:01,979
And we'll start tomorrow.

4453
05:32:05,060 --> 05:32:06,900
I really do want to set up that personality test.

4454
05:32:06,900 --> 05:32:08,659
That's probably what, I'm gonna try to get that done.

4455
05:32:09,590 --> 05:32:11,509
There's like two or three things that I really want to get done here.

4456
05:32:12,069 --> 05:32:16,919
But I'll see you tomorrow.

4457
05:32:16,919 --> 05:32:23,939
Don't worry.

4458
05:32:23,939 --> 05:32:25,060
Drink more water.

4459
05:32:25,779 --> 05:32:30,459
I actually, I drink a lot of water now since moving to Vegas.

4460
05:32:34,040 --> 05:32:35,880
Yeah LaboVR is on the table too.

4461
05:32:36,520 --> 05:32:38,470
There's a lot of random stuff to do.

4462
05:32:48,139 --> 05:32:51,479
Yeah, maybe we'll just do the bits and hang out.

4463
05:32:53,110 --> 05:32:54,630
This will take us to about six hours.

4464
05:32:55,189 --> 05:33:01,979
I'm gonna grab some food and we'll go tomorrow.

4465
05:33:05,029 --> 05:33:05,909
Poor Far Cry.

4466
05:33:05,909 --> 05:33:07,029
Oh no, Far Cry.

4467
05:33:07,029 --> 05:33:08,229
I forgot about Far Cry.

4468
05:33:09,700 --> 05:33:11,459
Instead of Jerma lied about certain things,

4469
05:33:11,459 --> 05:33:13,939
you should just do Jerma forgot about certain things.

4470
05:33:16,680 --> 05:33:18,279
That actually is way more accurate.

4471
05:33:19,220 --> 05:33:21,299
Jerma forgot about Far Cry.

4472
05:33:21,860 --> 05:33:25,430
Jerma forgot about Sam and Max.

4473
05:33:25,430 --> 05:33:27,270
Jerma forgot about Minecraft.

4474
05:33:27,990 --> 05:33:31,159
Jerma forgot about Dragon's Dogma.

4475
05:33:31,159 --> 05:33:31,880
There you go, you got it.

4476
05:33:32,439 --> 05:33:37,610
Jerma lied is more clickbaity.

4477
05:33:38,650 --> 05:33:39,770
Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?

4478
05:33:40,700 --> 05:33:41,659
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4479
05:33:42,220 --> 05:33:44,380
We'll go back to about six hours ago.

4480
05:33:45,750 --> 05:33:48,069
To Louis with six bucks.

4481
05:33:48,069 --> 05:33:50,069
Six hours ago, six dollars from Louis.

4482
05:33:50,970 --> 05:33:51,689
They just say hi.

4483
05:33:53,270 --> 05:33:56,360
Thank you, Louis, for the six bucks.

4484
05:33:57,159 --> 05:34:01,000
We had 10, 15 community subs from Squirds that I missed.

4485
05:34:02,099 --> 05:34:04,819
I was very focused in the first couple hours of the stream.

4486
05:34:04,819 --> 05:34:06,419
And I think we'll be in italics of trying to

4487
05:34:07,299 --> 05:34:09,540
get in a lobby and stuff and it just wasn't working.

4488
05:34:09,540 --> 05:34:12,020
But thank you so much for the 15 community subs.

4489
05:34:12,979 --> 05:34:16,860
It's a lot.

4490
05:34:16,860 --> 05:34:17,259
Thank you.

4491
05:34:18,139 --> 05:34:25,720
When's the next big stream event?

4492
05:34:26,360 --> 05:34:32,419
Hopefully soon, because I started working on

4493
05:34:33,380 --> 05:34:35,860
something very in particular that I've talked about recently.

4494
05:34:36,659 --> 05:34:39,400
It should be a blast.

4495
05:34:40,119 --> 05:34:42,389
The pieces all have to come together though.

4496
05:34:42,389 --> 05:34:44,069
I don't think that'll be more than another month.

4497
05:34:44,790 --> 05:34:46,569
It'll be within the next 30 days.

4498
05:34:48,819 --> 05:34:49,939
No, not green screen, too.

4499
05:34:50,580 --> 05:34:52,380
Something a little more weird.

4500
05:34:58,060 --> 05:34:58,860
Hopefully it works.

4501
05:35:03,349 --> 05:35:04,950
But PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 250.

4502
05:35:05,669 --> 05:35:07,029
Hey Jerma, how was your vacation?

4503
05:35:08,169 --> 05:35:08,650
It was good.

4504
05:35:09,290 --> 05:35:10,009
Hope all is well.

4505
05:35:10,009 --> 05:35:12,729
I auditioned for something recently and I felt really confident.

4506
05:35:13,450 --> 05:35:15,669
I had it in my head that I was going to get it,

4507
05:35:15,669 --> 05:35:18,389
but I found out today that I didn't get casted.

4508
05:35:18,389 --> 05:35:19,349
Hurts my feelings a lot,

4509
05:35:19,349 --> 05:35:22,150
but I guess this is just what I have to go through till I get casted.

4510
05:35:22,790 --> 05:35:25,830
I guess it just sucks because I really felt confident.

4511
05:35:25,830 --> 05:35:27,029
I don't usually feel that way.

4512
05:35:27,750 --> 05:35:29,110
Maybe I didn't do as well as I thought.

4513
05:35:30,540 --> 05:35:32,939
Well, I think you're approaching it the wrong way.

4514
05:35:33,740 --> 05:35:34,939
I'll tell you exactly why.

4515
05:35:36,979 --> 05:35:40,919
Because every single role that you audition for

4516
05:35:42,869 --> 05:35:46,229
is not a role that you kind of have to look at it like

4517
05:35:47,349 --> 05:35:48,630
audition for a bunch of stuff.

4518
05:35:49,669 --> 05:35:51,830
And if you get one of them, great.

4519
05:35:52,470 --> 05:35:54,790
But if you get attached to a role

4520
05:35:55,750 --> 05:35:58,709
before you even have a part in it,

4521
05:36:00,229 --> 05:36:00,630
you'll be like,

4522
05:36:00,630 --> 05:36:02,470
oh shit, I really wanted that fucking part.

4523
05:36:02,470 --> 05:36:03,990
I really wanted to do that.

4524
05:36:03,990 --> 05:36:05,189
I wanted to do that.

4525
05:36:05,189 --> 05:36:06,069
It should be me, right?

4526
05:36:06,069 --> 05:36:08,150
You get kind of stuck in there.

4527
05:36:08,869 --> 05:36:12,470
But the way to combat that is to just keep auditioning for things

4528
05:36:12,470 --> 05:36:16,069
and then by the time you audition for another three, four, five things,

4529
05:36:16,069 --> 05:36:17,430
the thing you auditioned for earlier,

4530
05:36:18,229 --> 05:36:19,909
you don't even care about it anymore.

4531
05:36:23,290 --> 05:36:28,360
Also, it can take a while for anything like that to even happen.

4532
05:36:28,919 --> 05:36:37,770
You know, casting and acting and it's a tough business

4533
05:36:38,580 --> 05:36:40,500
because there's a lot of people also doing it too.

4534
05:36:41,060 --> 05:36:45,900
So if you like a regular job process,

4535
05:36:45,900 --> 05:36:47,580
yeah, I mean, that's what it is.

4536
05:36:49,340 --> 05:36:51,259
When you go, when you send an audition tape in

4537
05:36:51,819 --> 05:36:56,860
or if you put in an application to a job,

4538
05:36:57,659 --> 05:36:58,700
they're kind of the same thing.

4539
05:37:00,439 --> 05:37:01,959
Maybe they didn't think that you were right for it.

4540
05:37:01,959 --> 05:37:02,840
That happens all the time.

4541
05:37:03,479 --> 05:37:14,259
You talk like you used to be an actor.

4542
05:37:16,500 --> 05:37:19,380
Well, I mean, I've been in a few things

4543
05:37:22,139 --> 05:37:25,740
and I had like demo tapes and reels and stuff.

4544
05:37:25,740 --> 05:37:27,740
I've done all kinds of stuff like that before.

4545
05:37:28,900 --> 05:37:30,180
Not even professionally either.

4546
05:37:30,180 --> 05:37:31,540
Like this is all stuff from years ago.

4547
05:37:32,259 --> 05:37:36,020
I used to do that instead of doing YouTube videos.

4548
05:37:36,020 --> 05:37:36,580
It was what I did.

4549
05:37:36,580 --> 05:37:37,459
I just did it online.

4550
05:37:43,000 --> 05:37:43,880
Send a tape?

4551
05:37:47,349 --> 05:37:49,509
Yeah, the best advice that I can give with that is

4552
05:37:52,340 --> 05:37:54,500
you do not go into auditions

4553
05:37:55,139 --> 05:37:56,659
thinking you're going to get the part.

4554
05:37:58,409 --> 05:37:59,610
You should go into auditions

4555
05:37:59,610 --> 05:38:03,860
thinking that you have an opportunity to and a chance to

4556
05:38:04,500 --> 05:38:06,740
and you're in that with everybody else.

4557
05:38:08,419 --> 05:38:12,340
So you should try to rise above everybody else

4558
05:38:12,340 --> 05:38:15,139
because you know that it's not certain.

4559
05:38:15,139 --> 05:38:17,380
So try to do a better job than everybody else, right?

4560
05:38:18,259 --> 05:38:22,979
But I wish you luck.

4561
05:38:26,250 --> 05:38:30,060
Punch away at a few more auditions, see what happens.

4562
05:38:30,060 --> 05:38:32,060
You're never going to know what happens unless you try it.

4563
05:38:37,909 --> 05:38:38,709
But thank you.

4564
05:38:38,709 --> 05:38:39,590
With the 250.

4565
05:38:39,590 --> 05:38:40,150
Appreciate it.

4566
05:38:43,909 --> 05:38:45,750
My name is Peef.

4567
05:38:45,750 --> 05:38:46,709
Gave $10.

4568
05:38:47,639 --> 05:38:48,439
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

4569
05:38:48,439 --> 05:38:50,759
They say P-P-P-Pass the Ale.

4570
05:38:52,279 --> 05:38:53,159
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

4571
05:38:59,290 --> 05:38:59,689
Thank you.

4572
05:39:00,619 --> 05:39:01,659
I don't know what that's from but

4573
05:39:05,349 --> 05:39:05,909
maybe I do.

4574
05:39:05,909 --> 05:39:06,790
Maybe I've heard it before.

4575
05:39:07,659 --> 05:39:08,779
But I appreciate the $10.

4576
05:39:08,779 --> 05:39:09,340
Thank you.

4577
05:39:09,340 --> 05:39:10,139
My name is Peef.

4578
05:39:10,860 --> 05:39:20,919
What do you mean?

4579
05:39:20,919 --> 05:39:21,639
What are you talking about?

4580
05:39:22,680 --> 05:39:25,669
Passes off his dreams.

4581
05:39:26,310 --> 05:39:33,130
Jeremy's a lazy boy.

4582
05:39:33,130 --> 05:39:34,009
Oh, dreams.

4583
05:39:34,889 --> 05:39:36,409
Oh, his actual...

4584
05:39:36,409 --> 05:39:37,209
Okay, I see.

4585
05:39:38,009 --> 05:39:38,970
I see where you're going here.

4586
05:39:43,159 --> 05:39:43,880
Chunky baloney.

4587
05:39:43,880 --> 05:39:44,840
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

4588
05:39:44,840 --> 05:39:45,880
Don't listen to them, Jerma.

4589
05:39:45,880 --> 05:39:47,240
I love your boomer techniques.

4590
05:39:50,740 --> 05:39:53,259
I was doing all right.

4591
05:39:53,259 --> 05:39:53,900
Okay.

4592
05:39:53,900 --> 05:39:58,520
I was doing okay.

4593
05:39:59,319 --> 05:40:01,080
And not about how good I'm playing.

4594
05:40:01,080 --> 05:40:02,279
It's about how much fun I'm having.

4595
05:40:02,279 --> 05:40:03,159
Don't you understand?

4596
05:40:04,040 --> 05:40:05,689
I hope you guys understand that.

4597
05:40:12,250 --> 05:40:14,009
Fun, Jerma, disgust.

4598
05:40:14,009 --> 05:40:15,130
No fun allowed.

4599
05:40:15,849 --> 05:40:20,090
Does this streamer have a dog?

4600
05:40:20,090 --> 05:40:21,130
Yes, this streamer does.

4601
05:40:21,770 --> 05:40:22,889
It's a Dachshund mix.

4602
05:40:23,610 --> 05:40:25,139
His name is Otto.

4603
05:40:25,139 --> 05:40:25,939
He's a very good dog.

4604
05:40:26,500 --> 05:40:27,380
Great dog, actually.

4605
05:40:30,950 --> 05:40:32,950
Thank you, Ixian Games, for the 550.

4606
05:40:33,509 --> 05:40:35,750
One of my rats is sick

4607
05:40:35,750 --> 05:40:37,750
and since you're the Jerma Rat Guy,

4608
05:40:37,750 --> 05:40:39,270
I figured I'd throw positive vibes

4609
05:40:39,270 --> 05:40:40,630
into the universe in your direction.

4610
05:40:40,630 --> 05:40:41,430
Thanks for the laughs.

4611
05:40:42,150 --> 05:40:46,119
Hopefully your rat is okay.

4612
05:40:46,919 --> 05:40:48,099
I'm sorry to hear that.

4613
05:40:49,060 --> 05:40:53,659
Thank you for hanging out.

4614
05:40:56,520 --> 05:40:57,159
Otto, all right.

4615
05:40:57,159 --> 05:41:00,119
Otto is in bed right now with Kim.

4616
05:41:00,759 --> 05:41:01,459
That's all.

4617
05:41:03,430 --> 05:41:07,849
But I wish your rat a swift recovery.

4618
05:41:07,849 --> 05:41:08,569
Hopefully they're okay.

4619
05:41:09,369 --> 05:41:15,020
Otto, waiting room.

4620
05:41:15,659 --> 05:41:20,340
Waiting room.

4621
05:41:20,340 --> 05:41:21,139
You've seen him before.

4622
05:41:24,119 --> 05:41:28,360
Hey, thank you to Zorro Carlos.

4623
05:41:29,479 --> 05:41:32,119
And it's an ASCII art.

4624
05:41:32,119 --> 05:41:33,159
I don't know what this is.

4625
05:41:33,159 --> 05:41:35,159
It looks like the first half

4626
05:41:35,159 --> 05:41:36,599
or first third of an ASCII art.

4627
05:41:36,599 --> 05:41:37,240
I don't know what it is.

4628
05:41:38,040 --> 05:41:42,340
The only ASCII arts that I know of,

4629
05:41:43,299 --> 05:41:44,259
I only know of two.

4630
05:41:45,909 --> 05:41:52,279
And one of them is Mario shitting and the gnome.

4631
05:41:52,279 --> 05:41:53,639
I don't know any other ASCIIs.

4632
05:41:53,639 --> 05:41:54,520
I don't think there are any.

4633
05:42:04,779 --> 05:42:06,779
I've never, I just go,

4634
05:42:06,779 --> 05:42:07,500
oh, there it is.

4635
05:42:07,500 --> 05:42:09,099
There's like that fucking, there it is.

4636
05:42:09,099 --> 05:42:09,599
Cool.

4637
05:42:10,240 --> 05:42:13,159
There's like Mario like shitting

4638
05:42:13,159 --> 05:42:14,040
or whatever he's doing.

4639
05:42:14,680 --> 05:42:16,750
I'm like, all right.

4640
05:42:17,759 --> 05:42:19,360
No other ASCII art exists.

4641
05:42:26,909 --> 05:42:27,869
I thought he was pissing.

4642
05:42:27,869 --> 05:42:29,869
I don't, it gets deleted so fast

4643
05:42:29,869 --> 05:42:30,909
I don't even know what it is.

4644
05:42:32,650 --> 05:42:34,090
It's on there for a tenth of a second

4645
05:42:34,090 --> 05:42:34,810
and it's just gone.

4646
05:42:36,090 --> 05:42:37,849
And look, I'm not going to go to Google

4647
05:42:37,849 --> 05:42:39,290
and be like, what's that ASCII art

4648
05:42:39,290 --> 05:42:41,689
where like Mario's naked and pooing?

4649
05:42:42,409 --> 05:42:43,759
Why would I ever do that?

4650
05:42:44,400 --> 05:42:54,119
That's not something that I want to

4651
05:42:54,840 --> 05:42:56,119
go look up for any reason.

4652
05:42:56,680 --> 05:43:02,799
If only you had a Chrome extension

4653
05:43:02,799 --> 05:43:04,240
that could let you see deleted messages.

4654
05:43:04,240 --> 05:43:05,680
I don't want to see deleted messages.

4655
05:43:05,680 --> 05:43:06,880
They're deleted for a reason.

4656
05:43:07,680 --> 05:43:10,540
Curiosity killed the cat, man.

4657
05:43:10,540 --> 05:43:12,939
I don't want to open up like a virus website.

4658
05:43:13,819 --> 05:43:21,819
But thank you Zorro Carlos for the top half

4659
05:43:21,819 --> 05:43:23,500
of I'm not sure what it is, but thank you.

4660
05:43:25,959 --> 05:43:28,040
Snoozing Copter, I have VTTV.

4661
05:43:28,919 --> 05:43:30,200
Snoozing Copter, thanks for the 250.

4662
05:43:30,200 --> 05:43:31,080
Hey, I just want to say thank you

4663
05:43:31,080 --> 05:43:32,759
for showing me that Dreams exists.

4664
05:43:33,479 --> 05:43:35,900
I was a huge little big planet fan.

4665
05:43:35,900 --> 05:43:37,259
I never knew this game was in development

4666
05:43:37,259 --> 05:43:38,779
until you first mentioned it some time ago.

4667
05:43:39,340 --> 05:43:41,500
Can't wait for the insane shit people make.

4668
05:43:42,139 --> 05:43:44,060
You could have played the tutorials on stream, by the way.

4669
05:43:44,060 --> 05:43:45,419
They're much more fun and interactive

4670
05:43:45,419 --> 05:43:47,419
than the first introductory tutorial.

4671
05:43:47,419 --> 05:43:49,020
Would have been nice learning along with you.

4672
05:43:49,659 --> 05:43:51,419
Whatever, looking forward to it regardless.

4673
05:43:52,299 --> 05:43:55,000
No, I thought about it, but

4674
05:43:58,810 --> 05:44:01,020
there's two sides to that coin, right?

4675
05:44:01,979 --> 05:44:08,000
The first side is just play the game

4676
05:44:08,000 --> 05:44:09,279
and do all the tutorials

4677
05:44:09,279 --> 05:44:10,880
and sit there for three, four, five hours

4678
05:44:10,880 --> 05:44:12,240
and just do the tutorials

4679
05:44:12,240 --> 05:44:13,360
and just enjoy the game.

4680
05:44:14,919 --> 05:44:19,240
But for a stream and a broadcast sense,

4681
05:44:19,799 --> 05:44:22,040
a live video sense,

4682
05:44:24,040 --> 05:44:25,720
I don't know if I want that stream

4683
05:44:25,720 --> 05:44:29,340
just because that other side of the coin.

4684
05:44:29,340 --> 05:44:30,619
The first side is great.

4685
05:44:30,619 --> 05:44:31,659
We do it all the time,

4686
05:44:31,659 --> 05:44:32,779
just hanging out and playing the game.

4687
05:44:35,419 --> 05:44:38,040
But still, remember,

4688
05:44:38,040 --> 05:44:40,279
I only stream three or four days a week.

4689
05:44:42,060 --> 05:44:45,180
Sometimes maybe, it depends on the week, right?

4690
05:44:45,180 --> 05:44:48,139
Maybe four times, maybe five maybe

4691
05:44:48,139 --> 05:44:49,020
if something's going on.

4692
05:44:50,569 --> 05:44:52,970
So I want all the streams that happen

4693
05:44:54,009 --> 05:44:54,889
to have something,

4694
05:44:57,000 --> 05:44:58,439
at least something significant to happen.

4695
05:45:00,189 --> 05:45:01,950
Not every stream has to be crazy,

4696
05:45:01,950 --> 05:45:03,869
but if I'm given the opportunity

4697
05:45:03,869 --> 05:45:07,790
to play Dreams and stream the tutorial

4698
05:45:07,790 --> 05:45:09,709
for one of my streams during the week

4699
05:45:09,709 --> 05:45:12,680
or check out more of the content

4700
05:45:12,680 --> 05:45:14,200
that's available to watch,

4701
05:45:14,200 --> 05:45:15,560
I'll do that one first, right?

4702
05:45:19,099 --> 05:45:20,939
That's not to say that I don't

4703
05:45:20,939 --> 05:45:22,459
just hang out and play a game sometimes.

4704
05:45:22,459 --> 05:45:23,340
I did that tonight.

4705
05:45:25,150 --> 05:45:26,590
But playing this game

4706
05:45:26,590 --> 05:45:28,830
and throwing axes at people

4707
05:45:28,830 --> 05:45:30,750
and these giant battles,

4708
05:45:30,750 --> 05:45:32,110
I think is more engaging

4709
05:45:32,990 --> 05:45:34,750
than simply just doing tutorials

4710
05:45:34,750 --> 05:45:35,470
for five hours.

4711
05:45:36,750 --> 05:45:38,590
That's kind of the deal.

4712
05:45:47,209 --> 05:45:48,409
Nothing will compare to German

4713
05:45:48,409 --> 05:45:49,849
crying and farting noises.

4714
05:45:50,650 --> 05:45:52,319
I don't think I'll ever be able to see

4715
05:45:52,319 --> 05:45:53,759
some or do something like that again.

4716
05:45:54,319 --> 05:45:56,560
That was just that stupid and ridiculous.

4717
05:45:57,599 --> 05:45:59,759
You did a seven-hour stream

4718
05:45:59,759 --> 05:46:01,360
on that dumb newspaper game.

4719
05:46:01,360 --> 05:46:02,159
Newspaper game.

4720
05:46:02,959 --> 05:46:06,520
But also, I mean, I don't have

4721
05:46:08,639 --> 05:46:10,639
a certain thing that I do every time.

4722
05:46:11,919 --> 05:46:13,279
Picross? Picross is great.

4723
05:46:20,759 --> 05:46:22,279
I decide what I'm going to stream.

4724
05:46:23,000 --> 05:46:24,759
Usually, if it's not something

4725
05:46:24,759 --> 05:46:25,880
that's a big elaborate plan,

4726
05:46:26,759 --> 05:46:28,279
usually that week I decide,

4727
05:46:28,279 --> 05:46:29,159
hey, what's coming up?

4728
05:46:29,159 --> 05:46:29,720
What's out now?

4729
05:46:29,720 --> 05:46:30,599
What do I want to try?

4730
05:46:30,599 --> 05:46:31,400
That looks like fun.

4731
05:46:31,400 --> 05:46:32,439
No, no, I don't want to do that.

4732
05:46:34,889 --> 05:46:36,330
So if during the week,

4733
05:46:36,330 --> 05:46:38,009
hey, I'm going to play Sam and Max tomorrow.

4734
05:46:38,009 --> 05:46:39,209
That's just what I'm going to do.

4735
05:46:40,169 --> 05:46:41,770
I'm going to play Picross tomorrow, right?

4736
05:46:42,569 --> 05:46:45,900
That is what it is.

4737
05:46:46,459 --> 05:46:47,720
But I do appreciate that.

4738
05:46:47,720 --> 05:46:49,479
Thank you so much, snoozingcopter.

4739
05:46:50,119 --> 05:46:51,180
I can't wait to see

4740
05:46:51,180 --> 05:46:52,220
what people come up with in dreams.

4741
05:46:52,220 --> 05:46:53,979
I'm going to try to make at least a few things

4742
05:46:53,979 --> 05:46:55,099
that are worth showing.

4743
05:46:55,099 --> 05:46:56,060
Maybe we'll find out.

4744
05:46:56,860 --> 05:47:01,150
Freudian weapon, thanks to the 250.

4745
05:47:02,250 --> 05:47:02,729
No message.

4746
05:47:02,729 --> 05:47:04,729
They just say bleed purple bonus.

4747
05:47:05,610 --> 05:47:07,759
Is there like a bit bonus going on or something?

4748
05:47:08,479 --> 05:47:09,040
But thank you.

4749
05:47:11,119 --> 05:47:12,880
Sawdust bunnies, thanks to the 360.

4750
05:47:13,759 --> 05:47:15,599
Bonus 36.

4751
05:47:15,599 --> 05:47:16,000
Thank you.

4752
05:47:16,720 --> 05:47:18,810
So there is a bit bonus going on.

4753
05:47:18,810 --> 05:47:21,130
Cool. Thank you, guys.

4754
05:47:21,770 --> 05:47:24,409
We got Tingy for 250.

4755
05:47:24,409 --> 05:47:25,049
Thank you, Tingy.

4756
05:47:25,770 --> 05:47:28,090
Hey, dude, I went to go look for another battle royale.

4757
05:47:28,090 --> 05:47:29,369
I couldn't find one.

4758
05:47:29,369 --> 05:47:29,849
I searched.

4759
05:47:29,849 --> 05:47:31,849
I was going on the browsing category list.

4760
05:47:31,849 --> 05:47:33,529
I didn't find anyone playing battle royale.

4761
05:47:33,529 --> 05:47:34,090
Are you sure?

4762
05:47:34,090 --> 05:47:35,770
Maybe you were speaking out of tone there.

4763
05:47:35,770 --> 05:47:36,490
Oh, fuck.

4764
05:47:38,169 --> 05:47:38,650
Okay.

4765
05:47:38,650 --> 05:47:39,770
Yeah, I didn't.

4766
05:47:39,770 --> 05:47:41,290
I forgot what I said three hours ago.

4767
05:47:50,029 --> 05:47:50,830
God damn it.

4768
05:48:00,279 --> 05:48:01,720
Thank you, Tingy, for the 250.

4769
05:48:03,180 --> 05:48:05,099
Deep fried Gundam, thanks to the six bucks.

4770
05:48:07,180 --> 05:48:08,540
Six dollars from deep fried Gundam.

4771
05:48:08,540 --> 05:48:09,580
Well, I can't believe it's been two years

4772
05:48:09,580 --> 05:48:10,700
since I subbed to you, Jermbo.

4773
05:48:11,340 --> 05:48:12,299
Anyway, just wanted to let you know

4774
05:48:12,299 --> 05:48:14,459
how much you've helped me these past couple years.

4775
05:48:14,459 --> 05:48:16,860
Dealing with some crazy anxiety pretty much all my life

4776
05:48:16,860 --> 05:48:18,299
and your streams and videos have helped me

4777
05:48:18,299 --> 05:48:19,740
totally forget about it.

4778
05:48:19,740 --> 05:48:21,099
Even if it's just for a couple minutes.

4779
05:48:21,900 --> 05:48:23,259
So from the absolute bottom of my heart,

4780
05:48:23,259 --> 05:48:23,979
thank you so much.

4781
05:48:26,490 --> 05:48:27,209
It's my pleasure.

4782
05:48:27,209 --> 05:48:28,810
Thank you, deep fried Gundam.

4783
05:48:32,720 --> 05:48:34,400
I'm really happy that you enjoy the streams.

4784
05:48:34,400 --> 05:48:36,639
I'm really happy you enjoy the videos.

4785
05:48:36,639 --> 05:48:42,619
And thank you for being subscribed for two years.

4786
05:48:43,419 --> 05:48:45,549
That means a lot.

4787
05:48:45,549 --> 05:48:46,430
Thank you.

4788
05:48:46,430 --> 05:48:47,790
That's a fucking long time.

4789
05:48:52,220 --> 05:48:53,020
I wish you the best.

4790
05:48:53,659 --> 05:48:54,919
Thank you so much, dude.

4791
05:48:55,720 --> 05:48:58,599
You've got a great name, too.

4792
05:49:01,049 --> 05:49:02,090
Thank you for peeing?

4793
05:49:02,889 --> 05:49:08,330
What?

4794
05:49:08,330 --> 05:49:08,810
All right.

4795
05:49:08,810 --> 05:49:11,930
What is the pee poo obsession?

4796
05:49:12,959 --> 05:49:14,880
The pee pee poo poo thing?

4797
05:49:14,880 --> 05:49:15,759
Why is there?

4798
05:49:15,759 --> 05:49:16,400
What is that?

4799
05:49:16,959 --> 05:49:26,080
But is, okay.

4800
05:49:26,080 --> 05:49:28,319
But is that from something in particular

4801
05:49:28,319 --> 05:49:33,389
or is it just so stupid that it's funny?

4802
05:49:33,389 --> 05:49:34,669
I mean, I can get it.

4803
05:49:35,630 --> 05:49:36,270
I said that.

4804
05:49:36,270 --> 05:49:37,310
Did I say that before?

4805
05:49:38,349 --> 05:49:46,400
No, I didn't make that up.

4806
05:49:47,680 --> 05:49:49,520
Somebody just typed it one day on the internet

4807
05:49:49,520 --> 05:49:50,880
and then people started typing it again.

4808
05:49:51,599 --> 05:49:53,950
And you keep encouraging it.

4809
05:49:53,950 --> 05:49:54,349
Whatever.

4810
05:49:54,349 --> 05:49:55,470
I hope you have fun.

4811
05:49:56,189 --> 05:49:57,369
As long as you have fun.

4812
05:49:57,369 --> 05:49:58,250
I hope you're having fun.

4813
05:49:59,130 --> 05:50:00,090
Remember the guys that were building

4814
05:50:00,090 --> 05:50:02,009
the Fortnite Minecraft base in the game?

4815
05:50:02,009 --> 05:50:03,209
I hope you're having fun.

4816
05:50:03,209 --> 05:50:12,779
Sound like you.

4817
05:50:12,779 --> 05:50:14,139
Oh, it's instead of being,

4818
05:50:14,139 --> 05:50:15,259
it sounded like you said peeing.

4819
05:50:15,259 --> 05:50:15,580
I see.

4820
05:50:16,220 --> 05:50:18,840
Hey, Meef Playable, thanks for the $2.69.

4821
05:50:18,840 --> 05:50:21,159
BRB, designing a game where you have to have sex

4822
05:50:21,159 --> 05:50:23,319
with your teammates to respond dead players.

4823
05:50:29,000 --> 05:50:30,200
That would be pretty wild.

4824
05:50:30,840 --> 05:50:36,669
Imagine a game where you had to, you had to like,

4825
05:50:37,470 --> 05:50:38,669
no, it wouldn't even have to be,

4826
05:50:38,669 --> 05:50:39,950
you'd just be like procreation,

4827
05:50:39,950 --> 05:50:41,069
like cells or something.

4828
05:50:41,790 --> 05:50:47,389
This should be like a cell first person shooter

4829
05:50:47,389 --> 05:50:48,669
where you have to like spread out

4830
05:50:48,669 --> 05:50:58,330
and make it injured.

4831
05:50:58,330 --> 05:50:58,970
Does it exist?

4832
05:51:00,090 --> 05:51:02,000
No, not like Spore.

4833
05:51:04,959 --> 05:51:06,639
I guess this, this is a Garrio.

4834
05:51:07,200 --> 05:51:08,319
That game does already exist.

4835
05:51:08,319 --> 05:51:08,819
Nevermind.

4836
05:51:12,889 --> 05:51:15,450
Hey, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $20.

4837
05:51:16,569 --> 05:51:18,240
20 bucks from Dr. Pepper.

4838
05:51:18,240 --> 05:51:19,360
German movie when?

4839
05:51:20,240 --> 05:51:22,459
German movie when?

4840
05:51:26,970 --> 05:51:29,000
I have some ideas.

4841
05:51:29,560 --> 05:51:32,590
We'll see if they end up coming to fruition or not.

4842
05:51:34,799 --> 05:51:42,919
I have a few things that should happen.

4843
05:51:43,959 --> 05:51:45,080
Before the summer is over,

4844
05:51:47,200 --> 05:51:48,639
there should be at least two or three

4845
05:51:49,900 --> 05:51:53,020
elaborate streams that happen before summer's end.

4846
05:51:54,729 --> 05:51:57,290
They, I don't know why they wouldn't happen,

4847
05:52:04,029 --> 05:52:06,990
but thank you, Dr. Pepper, for the $22.

4848
05:52:07,709 --> 05:52:08,700
Appreciate it.

4849
05:52:09,259 --> 05:52:11,819
Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the $15.

4850
05:52:11,819 --> 05:52:13,419
Would this convince you to use the loot

4851
05:52:13,419 --> 05:52:14,220
for a couple of rounds?

4852
05:52:14,220 --> 05:52:15,020
I beg you.

4853
05:52:15,740 --> 05:52:17,759
I beg of you as a bard.

4854
05:52:19,340 --> 05:52:21,259
I used it for a couple of rounds.

4855
05:52:21,259 --> 05:52:23,020
I just don't, didn't like the building.

4856
05:52:23,900 --> 05:52:28,729
With coordination that would work very well with the team,

4857
05:52:29,529 --> 05:52:32,189
but I just want to slash at people

4858
05:52:32,189 --> 05:52:34,430
and laugh at rocks being thrown.

4859
05:52:35,229 --> 05:52:37,470
When's the next Labo stream?

4860
05:52:37,470 --> 05:52:39,709
That Labo stream is going to be, are you ready?

4861
05:52:40,759 --> 05:52:51,549
The Nintendo Labo stream is going to be on Saturday.

4862
05:52:52,029 --> 05:52:57,950
Saturday, the 4th of May.

4863
05:53:01,049 --> 05:53:02,650
Maybe I'll have a few glasses of wine?

4864
05:53:03,290 --> 05:53:08,830
Maybe I'll break something in my room?

4865
05:53:08,830 --> 05:53:09,470
Probably not.

4866
05:53:13,200 --> 05:53:14,959
And I'm going to be dressed as Darth Vader

4867
05:53:14,959 --> 05:53:16,080
because it's Star Wars day.

4868
05:53:16,799 --> 05:53:18,810
Why do they say that?

4869
05:53:18,810 --> 05:53:19,689
No, I have to do that.

4870
05:53:29,099 --> 05:53:29,900
Don't do that.

4871
05:53:31,580 --> 05:53:33,180
Get a sound effects lightsaber.

4872
05:53:33,180 --> 05:53:34,939
What would that have anything to do with the Labo?

4873
05:53:37,950 --> 05:53:40,830
And have the Darth Vader voice on the whole stream?

4874
05:53:45,259 --> 05:53:51,740
Uh, no, I, nobody will, everyone will hate it.

4875
05:53:51,740 --> 05:53:52,939
Everybody hated Bugleberry

4876
05:53:52,939 --> 05:53:54,700
because he couldn't understand a word he was saying.

4877
05:53:55,259 --> 05:53:56,540
You think that'll happen on the Labo?

4878
05:54:02,669 --> 05:54:03,069
We'll see.

4879
05:54:03,709 --> 05:54:07,290
He wanted to do it, but he's blaming us.

4880
05:54:07,290 --> 05:54:10,490
No, I'm saying that's stupid enough

4881
05:54:10,490 --> 05:54:12,729
for where I think it's funny that I wouldn't want to.

4882
05:54:17,639 --> 05:54:18,139
Maybe.

4883
05:54:19,209 --> 05:54:20,889
I'll at least wear a Star Wars t-shirt.

4884
05:54:20,889 --> 05:54:21,450
Is that enough?

4885
05:54:26,520 --> 05:54:27,720
Fucking Bugleberry.

4886
05:54:35,709 --> 05:54:38,590
Bugleberry should do haunted house reviews.

4887
05:54:39,229 --> 05:54:42,509
I want it gets to be that time of year.

4888
05:54:47,130 --> 05:54:49,599
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

4889
05:54:49,599 --> 05:54:52,000
Do IRL haunted house reviews.

4890
05:54:52,799 --> 05:54:54,830
And the camera goes through with him

4891
05:54:54,830 --> 05:54:56,189
and he's criticizing things

4892
05:54:56,189 --> 05:54:57,709
and talking about how scary things are.

4893
05:54:58,590 --> 05:55:14,880
Bugleberry should be put in a retirement home.

4894
05:55:14,880 --> 05:55:15,840
He's not that old.

4895
05:55:15,840 --> 05:55:17,040
He's like 41.

4896
05:55:18,080 --> 05:55:19,360
Why do you think he's that old?

4897
05:55:20,080 --> 05:55:22,750
He's like six or seven years older than I am.

4898
05:55:29,659 --> 05:55:31,180
But thank you to Ert.

4899
05:55:32,060 --> 05:55:33,979
Ert110 for the five dollars.

4900
05:55:34,619 --> 05:55:36,810
Were you serious about community dream stuff?

4901
05:55:36,810 --> 05:55:38,409
If so, can we have a submission date?

4902
05:55:40,400 --> 05:55:41,439
I would say let's...

4903
05:55:42,970 --> 05:55:46,169
To make it for real, right?

4904
05:55:46,169 --> 05:55:46,970
Because somebody was saying

4905
05:55:47,849 --> 05:55:49,450
five or six days might not be long enough.

4906
05:55:50,169 --> 05:55:50,889
Let's say...

4907
05:55:52,250 --> 05:55:58,270
Well, remember, it's not a submission deadline, right?

4908
05:55:58,830 --> 05:56:00,349
Because I'm not compiling them.

4909
05:56:00,349 --> 05:56:01,549
What would happen is we would...

4910
05:56:02,349 --> 05:56:03,229
Let me look this up

4911
05:56:03,229 --> 05:56:04,509
because I want to make sure this is possible.

4912
05:56:05,229 --> 05:56:08,360
Have a tag or a searchable title tag or something

4913
05:56:08,360 --> 05:56:10,040
where we can get a playlist or something like that.

4914
05:56:10,919 --> 05:56:14,889
So it'd be easy for me to just type in the word germa

4915
05:56:16,009 --> 05:56:19,040
and have that just...

4916
05:56:19,040 --> 05:56:21,119
I can find them from there or from a hashtag.

4917
05:56:21,119 --> 05:56:22,400
Let me see if that's even possible

4918
05:56:23,200 --> 05:56:27,119
because this currently is the dream's early access program.

4919
05:56:28,240 --> 05:56:30,479
So all these features might not exist yet.

4920
05:56:30,479 --> 05:56:31,520
Let me figure that out.

4921
05:56:32,479 --> 05:56:36,060
But it would be at least a week from now.

4922
05:56:41,880 --> 05:56:43,880
But yes, I am serious about that

4923
05:56:43,880 --> 05:56:45,000
because I want to make stuff in it too.

4924
05:56:45,639 --> 05:56:48,599
At least movies or a short video

4925
05:56:48,599 --> 05:56:50,360
or a little game or something or a painting.

4926
05:56:50,360 --> 05:56:51,080
I want to do...

4927
05:56:51,080 --> 05:56:51,959
I want to at least make something.

4928
05:56:51,959 --> 05:56:53,240
I've been waiting for that game for a long time.

4929
05:56:55,979 --> 05:56:58,380
Hey, Mr. Comcast, thanks to the $5.

4930
05:56:58,380 --> 05:56:59,099
Hey, Germa.

4931
05:56:59,099 --> 05:57:00,700
John Comcast here.

4932
05:57:00,700 --> 05:57:02,860
Just letting you know that we here at Comcast

4933
05:57:02,860 --> 05:57:03,979
have forgotten about you.

4934
05:57:04,540 --> 05:57:05,900
Have not forgotten about you.

4935
05:57:06,540 --> 05:57:09,099
I personally caress a picture of your face

4936
05:57:09,099 --> 05:57:10,139
every night before bed.

4937
05:57:10,779 --> 05:57:12,619
But anyway, yeah, just calling to let you know

4938
05:57:13,180 --> 05:57:14,380
what we're about.

4939
05:57:14,380 --> 05:57:15,180
We're still around.

4940
05:57:15,740 --> 05:57:17,979
You know, if that cock stuff doesn't work out for you,

4941
05:57:17,979 --> 05:57:19,020
also ignore that guy

4942
05:57:19,900 --> 05:57:21,580
that comes to your house every morning

4943
05:57:21,580 --> 05:57:23,740
trying to break one of your windows with a brick.

4944
05:57:23,740 --> 05:57:24,779
My aim is pretty bad

4945
05:57:24,779 --> 05:57:26,540
so you shouldn't have to worry about it much.

4946
05:57:31,360 --> 05:57:32,400
Well, but why...

4947
05:57:32,400 --> 05:57:34,560
John Comcast, why do you say you're calling me?

4948
05:57:36,360 --> 05:57:38,200
Just calling to let you know we're still around.

4949
05:57:38,200 --> 05:57:38,919
This is a text.

4950
05:57:41,310 --> 05:57:42,590
Just calling to let you know.

4951
05:57:43,560 --> 05:57:46,439
A weird creepy ex-Comcast.

4952
05:57:50,169 --> 05:57:51,849
Well, Comcast, I'm sorry, but I have moved on.

4953
05:57:53,400 --> 05:57:53,959
You should too.

4954
05:57:55,790 --> 05:57:57,229
And let's get the credits rolling here.

4955
05:57:59,290 --> 05:58:00,889
Thank you, everybody that played.

4956
05:58:00,889 --> 05:58:01,610
If you jumped in.

4957
05:58:02,330 --> 05:58:04,779
If you jumped in and stream sniped me

4958
05:58:04,779 --> 05:58:06,380
and killed me over and over again.

4959
05:58:06,380 --> 05:58:07,180
Thank you for playing.

4960
05:58:09,840 --> 05:58:11,119
No, I'm kidding.

4961
05:58:11,919 --> 05:58:15,040
Thanks for playing.

4962
05:58:15,040 --> 05:58:16,080
That game's a lot of fun.

4963
05:58:16,080 --> 05:58:16,479
I'll probably...

4964
05:58:16,479 --> 05:58:17,040
You see it again.

4965
05:58:17,919 --> 05:58:21,000
Made Jerma mad.

4966
05:58:21,799 --> 05:58:26,250
Oh, fucking stream sniping.

4967
05:58:26,970 --> 05:58:32,970
Hey, long as you're having fun, right?

4968
05:58:33,770 --> 05:58:39,000
I need to have a permanent defender with a shield

4969
05:58:39,799 --> 05:58:41,319
that just gets in the fucking way

4970
05:58:41,319 --> 05:58:43,880
when somebody runs across the map to try to kill me.

4971
05:58:44,439 --> 05:58:47,479
I need someone just to always be looking for that.

4972
05:58:47,479 --> 05:58:49,479
I need to have my own personal shield butler.

4973
05:58:50,040 --> 05:59:00,520
A spy's statue.

4974
05:59:05,400 --> 05:59:06,520
Like a bodyguard?

4975
05:59:06,520 --> 05:59:07,720
Yeah, a shield butler.

4976
05:59:09,880 --> 05:59:10,599
A bodyguard.

4977
05:59:11,240 --> 05:59:11,799
You get it.

4978
05:59:12,680 --> 05:59:14,200
I'm going to have a bodyguard next time.

4979
05:59:14,200 --> 05:59:15,000
I'm going to make sure it's something

4980
05:59:15,000 --> 05:59:16,439
that's real fucking good at the game too.

4981
05:59:18,919 --> 05:59:20,279
You know, I might even hire that guy.

4982
05:59:20,919 --> 05:59:23,130
I might hire the guy.

4983
05:59:23,770 --> 05:59:25,450
Okay, you know how like sometimes people like...

4984
05:59:25,450 --> 05:59:26,569
You like hack something.

4985
05:59:27,290 --> 05:59:30,619
The hacker gets in and fucks up a bunch of stuff

4986
05:59:30,619 --> 05:59:32,139
and like the employees get a hold of him

4987
05:59:32,139 --> 05:59:33,900
and they're like, oh, hold on a second there.

4988
05:59:33,900 --> 05:59:36,540
We want to hire you to fix our infrastructure.

4989
05:59:36,540 --> 05:59:37,259
And they're like, what?

4990
05:59:37,259 --> 05:59:37,900
Fucking okay.

4991
05:59:41,549 --> 05:59:43,880
Maybe that'll be the defender.

4992
05:59:56,380 --> 06:00:00,139
And then I kick him off the cliff and exit the server.

4993
06:00:00,700 --> 06:00:09,720
I make him defend me for like 30 minutes

4994
06:00:09,720 --> 06:00:11,159
and then I'm like, all right, man, high five.

4995
06:00:11,159 --> 06:00:11,479
And I go...

4996
06:00:12,860 --> 06:00:15,419
And just off the fucking edge.

4997
06:00:15,419 --> 06:00:19,000
And I point down and I go,

4998
06:00:19,000 --> 06:00:21,080
that's what you get for crossing me.

4999
06:00:21,159 --> 06:00:22,599
That's what you get for crossing me.

5000
06:00:23,400 --> 06:00:27,529
And by this point, I have a full fucking hood up

5001
06:00:28,090 --> 06:00:31,209
and my skin is starting to turn like blue.

5002
06:00:40,590 --> 06:00:41,630
No, not green, blue.

5003
06:00:48,569 --> 06:00:49,770
Anyways, let's get the credits rolling.

5004
06:00:49,770 --> 06:00:51,209
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sam and Max.

5005
06:00:51,849 --> 06:00:54,729
And then this weekend we'll do the labo

5006
06:00:54,729 --> 06:00:57,290
and then probably in like a couple of weeks maybe

5007
06:00:57,290 --> 06:00:59,930
a little bit more we'll fucking try to dunk me in a tank

5008
06:00:59,930 --> 06:01:01,290
and see if anybody can do it.

5009
06:01:02,169 --> 06:01:03,450
You didn't hear about that stream.

5010
06:01:03,450 --> 06:01:04,569
That's the next...

5011
06:01:04,569 --> 06:01:06,569
Somebody asked what's the next big project.

5012
06:01:06,569 --> 06:01:07,369
It's that.

5013
06:01:07,369 --> 06:01:08,250
That's going to happen.

5014
06:01:09,130 --> 06:01:11,049
I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

5015
06:01:11,049 --> 06:01:14,090
Twitch controls robot to try to dunk Jerma

5016
06:01:14,090 --> 06:01:14,889
that makes fun of you.

5017
06:01:18,680 --> 06:01:19,720
There's the next project.

5018
06:01:21,020 --> 06:01:23,500
People need to know that it's going to potentially happen

5019
06:01:23,500 --> 06:01:26,619
because the stream just can't turn on with controls.

5020
06:01:27,580 --> 06:01:36,759
Jerma is going to get hypothermia.

5021
06:01:37,479 --> 06:01:40,520
It's going to be like 115 degrees in Las Vegas

5022
06:01:40,520 --> 06:01:41,319
during that stream.

5023
06:01:41,880 --> 06:01:48,400
Hypothermia.

5024
06:01:48,959 --> 06:01:51,479
It's going to be...

5025
06:01:51,479 --> 06:01:52,759
You guys aren't even going to be able to do it.

5026
06:01:54,889 --> 06:01:56,569
I don't think that you guys are going to be able to do it.

5027
06:01:59,319 --> 06:02:00,919
I'll be sitting there taunting you.

5028
06:02:01,720 --> 06:02:06,639
Why does the sus say next week?

5029
06:02:07,439 --> 06:02:07,919
Does it?

5030
06:02:12,990 --> 06:02:14,189
Next Wednesday.

5031
06:02:15,310 --> 06:02:16,750
Uh well that's definitely tomorrow.

5032
06:02:19,290 --> 06:02:20,569
See you next week.

5033
06:02:20,569 --> 06:02:22,569
I'm taking another week off guys.

5034
06:02:22,569 --> 06:02:24,569
Yeah my mother decided she was going to come back.

5035
06:02:26,830 --> 06:02:27,549
See you in a week.

5036
06:02:29,720 --> 06:02:32,040
No uh hold on I got it.

5037
06:02:32,040 --> 06:02:32,279
I got it.

5038
06:02:32,279 --> 06:02:32,360
I got it.

5039
06:02:32,360 --> 06:02:32,439
I got it.

5040
06:02:32,439 --> 06:02:32,759
Ready?

5041
06:02:33,639 --> 06:02:35,560
Let's run those credits.

5042
06:02:39,470 --> 06:02:41,310
Thank you for all the resubs and all the new subs.

5043
06:02:41,310 --> 06:02:45,229
All the everybody that decides to support this channel for $5 every single month.

5044
06:02:46,270 --> 06:02:49,819
You guys keep the wheels turning forever.

5045
06:02:50,700 --> 06:02:54,439
Anybody that contributes a cent to this channel.

5046
06:02:56,319 --> 06:03:01,360
You're the battery that powers the vehicle to drive on the road.

5047
06:03:01,360 --> 06:03:02,240
So thank you.

5048
06:03:02,959 --> 06:03:08,349
And let me edit that command.

5049
06:03:08,349 --> 06:03:09,549
Commands.

5050
06:03:09,549 --> 06:03:26,939
It's Wednesday right?

5051
06:03:29,549 --> 06:03:30,669
Wednesday.

5052
06:03:30,669 --> 06:03:31,470
Wednesday.

5053
06:03:32,270 --> 06:03:34,650
Weird way to say that.

5054
06:03:45,080 --> 06:03:45,959
That should be good.

5055
06:03:48,009 --> 06:03:48,330
Hey.

5056
06:03:49,290 --> 06:03:53,799
We also had uh one more bit come in from Jack.

5057
06:03:55,560 --> 06:03:55,880
Jack.

5058
06:03:57,439 --> 06:03:58,159
Jet Island.

5059
06:03:58,720 --> 06:03:59,880
Sorry he froze me.

5060
06:03:59,880 --> 06:04:00,520
Jet Island.

5061
06:04:00,520 --> 06:04:01,400
Thanks for the 250.

5062
06:04:03,369 --> 06:04:04,569
Yeah VR.

5063
06:04:04,569 --> 06:04:06,409
There's two games I need to complete in VR.

5064
06:04:06,409 --> 06:04:07,930
I need to do Gorn.

5065
06:04:08,889 --> 06:04:11,069
I'm gonna be honest with you though man.

5066
06:04:13,069 --> 06:04:14,189
That shit killed me.

5067
06:04:14,750 --> 06:04:16,029
I don't know what it is.

5068
06:04:16,029 --> 06:04:18,590
Something about the last week of doing VR.

5069
06:04:19,150 --> 06:04:21,630
I did like three or four days in a row or something of VR.

5070
06:04:21,709 --> 06:04:23,229
And it fucking killed me.

5071
06:04:25,790 --> 06:04:26,909
More so than ever before.

5072
06:04:26,909 --> 06:04:28,029
So I had to take a break.

5073
06:04:28,029 --> 06:04:29,470
I had to box it up for a little while.

5074
06:04:30,909 --> 06:04:32,270
Gork VR?

5075
06:04:32,990 --> 06:04:49,119
What do you mean it killed you?

5076
06:04:50,000 --> 06:04:52,720
It just drained me so much that I couldn't do anything.

5077
06:04:52,720 --> 06:04:54,159
I could barely get up the next day.

5078
06:04:55,040 --> 06:05:03,209
I got up and I was just I was decrepit.

5079
06:05:07,159 --> 06:05:08,119
VR hangover.

5080
06:05:08,119 --> 06:05:09,400
I think that's a real thing.

5081
06:05:16,590 --> 06:05:17,790
That's my life.

5082
06:05:17,790 --> 06:05:22,700
Yeah I know.

5083
06:05:22,700 --> 06:05:24,619
VR hangovers every day.

5084
06:05:25,340 --> 06:05:30,799
Imagine what VR will be like in five years.

5085
06:05:30,799 --> 06:05:31,840
I don't think there'll be a headset.

5086
06:05:32,639 --> 06:05:36,330
Remember when the 3DS came out and everyone was like that's not possible.

5087
06:05:36,330 --> 06:05:37,049
How does it work?

5088
06:05:38,939 --> 06:05:42,860
I'm not wearing stereoscopic 3D glasses right now.

5089
06:05:42,860 --> 06:05:45,500
How can I see 3D without having 3D glasses?

5090
06:05:46,299 --> 06:05:50,250
That type of technology was just out of this world.

5091
06:05:50,250 --> 06:05:51,369
It was impossible.

5092
06:05:52,090 --> 06:05:59,470
There'll be a technology that comes around over the next decade

5093
06:06:00,430 --> 06:06:02,189
where you don't have to have that headset on.

5094
06:06:02,189 --> 06:06:03,389
You're not even gonna have to have a TV.

5095
06:06:04,939 --> 06:06:09,819
You'll have a little dome that just projects onto a wall or into your living room or something.

5096
06:06:11,639 --> 06:06:16,840
Everyone will just put on glasses and sit back in the chair wherever they're sitting

5097
06:06:16,840 --> 06:06:18,040
and there'll be no television.

5098
06:06:19,000 --> 06:06:23,479
We'll all be watching the same thing but through glasses

5099
06:06:24,939 --> 06:06:28,779
or through a new type of media that is made up.

5100
06:06:30,080 --> 06:06:31,759
That shit's not gonna happen by the way.

5101
06:06:32,400 --> 06:06:33,040
I don't think it is.

5102
06:06:33,040 --> 06:06:35,200
I think we've plateaued in the electronic department.

5103
06:06:37,520 --> 06:06:41,520
And I know I'm gonna be one of those people that's quoted here 100 years in the future.

5104
06:06:42,479 --> 06:06:46,139
Remember when all the people like 150 years ago, 200 years ago,

5105
06:06:46,139 --> 06:06:48,139
they were saying that planes will never exist.

5106
06:06:48,139 --> 06:06:48,939
You'll never fly.

5107
06:06:49,740 --> 06:06:51,020
Birds only do that.

5108
06:06:51,020 --> 06:06:51,979
You're not a bird.

5109
06:06:53,979 --> 06:06:55,500
Idiots, imbeciles.

5110
06:06:57,099 --> 06:07:00,299
I'm probably gonna be one of those people that just says I don't think in 50.

5111
06:07:00,299 --> 06:07:03,020
I don't even know if in like 30, 40 years it might not be possible.

5112
06:07:03,020 --> 06:07:04,700
I think we've plateaued electronically.

5113
06:07:05,419 --> 06:07:08,540
Things will get faster but until quantum computing

5114
06:07:09,259 --> 06:07:13,040
deletes our universe, we'll see.

5115
06:07:13,599 --> 06:07:18,060
It's gonna be wild.

5116
06:07:18,060 --> 06:07:18,860
Guys, just watch.

5117
06:07:19,419 --> 06:07:21,340
They're gonna turn on the quantum computer

5118
06:07:21,340 --> 06:07:24,380
and a little red line is gonna shoot out just instantly.

5119
06:07:24,380 --> 06:07:28,139
They're gonna be like oh we programmed it to do Simon Says.

5120
06:07:28,139 --> 06:07:29,099
Things gonna turn on.

5121
06:07:29,099 --> 06:07:31,900
Quantum computer is gonna point a fucking laser beam at the wall

5122
06:07:31,900 --> 06:07:35,630
and just it's gonna be just deleting.

5123
06:07:36,750 --> 06:07:38,830
And they're gonna be like trying to turn the fucking thing off

5124
06:07:38,830 --> 06:07:42,590
and it won't turn off and just delete, delete, delete, delete.

5125
06:07:42,590 --> 06:07:44,669
It's gonna go in a line and start deleting the earth.

5126
06:07:50,779 --> 06:07:53,659
Just one line by line, just back and forth.

5127
06:08:01,930 --> 06:08:05,209
They'll drop a nuclear bomb on this thing and it won't work.

5128
06:08:05,770 --> 06:08:07,369
They'll just delete the nuke before it lands.

5129
06:08:08,250 --> 06:08:10,169
It'll just point up like a sentry and just

5130
06:08:11,450 --> 06:08:12,970
just paint it over it like an eraser.

5131
06:08:21,290 --> 06:08:23,869
So I have no mouth and I must scream.

5132
06:08:23,869 --> 06:08:25,869
They were on, come on.

5133
06:08:28,029 --> 06:08:32,430
Every major scientist, every brilliant scientist,

5134
06:08:32,750 --> 06:08:35,229
you know what they all say, the biggest threat to humanity

5135
06:08:36,279 --> 06:08:41,560
is AI, is quantum computing, that's the biggest threat.

5136
06:08:41,560 --> 06:08:42,279
That's what they've said.

5137
06:08:48,060 --> 06:08:50,540
I think I trust the greatest minds to ever live

5138
06:08:50,540 --> 06:08:52,779
to give us an accurate representation

5139
06:08:52,779 --> 06:08:54,459
of what we should potentially be afraid of.

5140
06:08:55,340 --> 06:09:03,020
That's what Stephen Hawking said.

5141
06:09:04,700 --> 06:09:05,979
You don't trust Stephen Hawking?

5142
06:09:22,880 --> 06:09:24,159
He's right about black holes.

5143
06:09:26,430 --> 06:09:28,880
Yeah, he said aliens.

5144
06:09:29,520 --> 06:09:30,799
He said aliens.

5145
06:09:30,799 --> 06:09:31,919
But he has to say, oh, did he?

5146
06:09:44,200 --> 06:09:45,000
It wasn't aliens.

5147
06:09:46,200 --> 06:09:54,799
By 2014, Stephen Hawking and business magnate Elon Musk

5148
06:09:54,799 --> 06:09:56,400
had publicly voiced the opinion

5149
06:09:56,400 --> 06:09:58,400
that superhuman artificial intelligence

5150
06:09:58,400 --> 06:10:01,520
could provide incalculable benefits

5151
06:10:01,520 --> 06:10:07,580
but also can end the human race if deployed incautiously.

5152
06:10:10,759 --> 06:10:13,880
There you go, it would end the human race.

5153
06:10:17,099 --> 06:10:18,380
I remember he said that.

5154
06:10:18,380 --> 06:10:19,979
He said that artificial intelligence

5155
06:10:19,979 --> 06:10:24,299
is potentially one of the biggest threat facing humanity.

5156
06:10:29,259 --> 06:10:32,189
Anyway, thanks for sticking around.

5157
06:10:32,189 --> 06:10:32,830
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5158
06:10:41,450 --> 06:10:42,409
Look up aliens.

5159
06:10:43,290 --> 06:10:46,650
Now, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5160
06:10:46,650 --> 06:10:48,090
Take care, have a good rest of your night.

5161
06:10:48,729 --> 06:10:54,909
See you really soon for Sam and Max episode three, part two.

5162
06:10:56,139 --> 06:10:56,540
Good night.
