1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:14,949
Hello. Hello. I'm Andy. I'm Andy. I'm always a late Andy. I'm Landy. I'm Andy. I'm always late Andy.

2
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,789
I just like messed that up. Whatever. I practiced that for like 10 minutes.

3
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:29,239
I was in the mirror practicing that for an hour. Minus 50 minutes. Landy. Is this an ad?

4
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:43,100
Well, hold on. Not yet. Landy. We're gonna play two things today. We're gonna play Call to the

5
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:51,829
Lamb. It's out. It's out today, right? Or is it yesterday? Yesterday. Oh, spoiler. You know,

6
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't want you to hear the music. Can you stream in an hour? I'm kind of busy. Well,

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:05,209
I was supposed to start an hour ago. Pre-stream chat knows. I made it three o'clock so I could go,

8
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,870
oh man, hey, I'm live at two. And then I had to make a few very, very important phone calls

9
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:23,579
and that didn't work. Hey, but it's okay. I only turned out to be like 12, 10 minutes late

10
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,340
rather than an hour and 10 minutes late. So it's a good thing I didn't make it two o'clock, right?

11
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,049
Now you're thinking with portals. No, but how you doing? Welcome back. Today, we're going to be

12
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:45,209
playing Cult of the Lamb. Like I said earlier, should be fun. I've heard very, very good things.

13
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,689
I've heard people say that this is probably one of the better games that's come out this whole year.

14
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:57,049
The Twitch extension works. It's just very, very slow. I'll wait. I'll turn that on another time.

15
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:06,299
Once it's like good to go because I'm probably going to be playing this again. I didn't set that

16
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,610
up if I had to because like they turned it off. They turned it on. They updated it. They turned

17
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,710
it off. I'm going to wait until it's good to go. Yeah, we're going to play that for a little while

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:25,259
and then I'm going to move to Two Point Campus, which is going to be a sponsored part of the

19
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:32,039
stream. So Cult of the Lamb not sponsored. Two Point Campus is sponsored. I'm going to do a half

20
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:45,340
and half today. This game is so good. I'm going in completely blind here. I can't wait. I'm going to

21
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:53,830
say my mic is what? Your mic is picking up the music from the game. It is absolutely not. Is it?

22
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:12,120
Hold on a second. No, it isn't. No, you're full of shit. Your mic is picking up several dangerous

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:22,180
pathogens. What do you mean? It's doing it? Hold on. What? What do you think? Wait, when I talk,

24
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:32,330
you can hear it. What do you mean by that? It comes in when you talk. Huh? Hold on. Wait,

25
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:39,620
we have to do a test. So you're saying that if I keep the microphone open and have the noise

26
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:52,810
gate not come through, you hear the music. What? Yeah, I don't. I have absolutely no idea why

27
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:03,930
that's happening. Hold on. Does it fix it? No, that's not even the right mic. I am so confused.

28
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:12,310
Funny mic. What do you mean? What do you mean funny mic? That's the webcam.

29
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:23,019
Hold on. What happened? Why is it doing that? I have no response to this. Hold on.

30
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:38,889
OK, I don't want. Tell me if this fixes it. Did that fix it or is it still happening?

31
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:50,259
Uh. It's not there, but don't ask. I just turned off literally everything.

32
00:04:52,149 --> 00:05:02,069
But let me answer me this. You do hear it now, though, right? Scream into your webcam. OK,

33
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:07,990
we're good. I might not do face cam. I don't I have really I have I have unbrushed teeth today

34
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,959
and I haven't taken a shower or anything. So I look like a fucking just gross person. I don't

35
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,420
know. I might not have cam on today. I have a I have really unbrushed teeth. I'm just telling

36
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:32,540
you. That's a fact. I'm ready to play. You want to see what should we see what I look like?

37
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,939
I'm telling you, I have wicked bad unbrushed teeth. I know this sounds like an annoying thing

38
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:46,980
where I turn the cam on and I look fine. I look great. But I just tell you, oh, I haven't

39
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,819
showered. I haven't brushed my teeth. Everyone goes, oh, but you look so good. Right. How do I

40
00:05:53,819 --> 00:06:03,980
look? I literally I just I like I woke up like this and I didn't change it. How do I look?

41
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:14,649
How do my teeth look? Literally no one could have could have. Look at my hair, though.

42
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:26,600
This is called my head was mushed into the pillow. This is like I'm sleepy. It's not balding.

43
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,620
Who cares if I'm if I bald? Why is my webcam flickering? Like there's a candle in front of

44
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:41,980
me. Guys, if I go bald, whatever, I'm almost 40. OK, if I go bald, that's a normal human reaction

45
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:51,379
to getting older is balding a little. Oh, I turn 40 soon. If I go bald, go cares. I made it a long

46
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:58,259
time with all this hair. I don't even care. You look good for a guy that's in a zombie movie.

47
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,790
All right. Well, it's coming off for now. If you're good, it'll come back. You have to be good,

48
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:13,660
though. Good, though. Oh, my goodness. That might have been the worst one yet.

49
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,790
That might have been the worst one in a decade. Hold on. I got to turn this down.

50
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:30,660
Why do my gohooks a lot change all of its settings? That was weird because this is

51
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,860
routing the wrong way. Whatever. It's fine. OK, here we go. Call to the lamb. I'm ready to play.

52
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:48,740
It should be fun. Your face came on. I will if you're good. You got to be good. You're aging

53
00:07:48,740 --> 00:08:01,779
backwards and praise the lamb conduit to great power. Almost no sacrificial beast take heed

54
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:10,980
for a crown cannot sit upon two brows. All right. All you had to tell me there was x, x, x, x, x,

55
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:19,399
y, y, y, b, b, b, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y, b, b. That's all you had to say. x, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y,

56
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:38,659
b, b, b. This game was in the if you don't remember, this game was part of the Steam

57
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:45,830
demo day week, and it was one of our favorites. So I'm really glad to be playing it right now.

58
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,950
Where's this? Where's my precious streamer space? If you're good, you have to be good.

59
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,740
Azimala.

60
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:07,220
Vora stands the last of its kind, all others we have hunted down and put to the blade.

61
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,730
With this final sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.

62
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,970
The heretic who lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity,

63
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:44,460
and the old faith shall be preserved. So I'm dead. This is the eternal being that's been chained

64
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:56,470
down here for centuries, over 200 years. Come closer, fear not. Though you are already dead,

65
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:02,419
I still have need of you. This foolish bishop thought they could keep you from me in death,

66
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:08,100
but instead they sent you straight to me. I will give you life again, but at a price.

67
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:26,259
All I ask is you start a cult in my name. Do we have a deal? Yes. Sure. And so it came to pass

68
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:33,659
that the Countess, once bathed in rejuvenating blood. I've never heard the rest of that dialogue,

69
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:41,399
by the way. I've always pressed click right after that part. All right, let's go.

70
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:55,100
X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, B, B, B. I forgot how fun this game was. This game was, it's like,

71
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:10,470
okay, it's kind of like Finding of Isaac, kind of like Legend of Zelda, kind of like Star Tropics,

72
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:26,019
kind of like Frickin' Morty. Not. Like Dark Souls? I would, I don't think so. Fear not,

73
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,419
I am Rattau. I was once a chosen vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds.

74
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,769
I was sent to guide you. We are deep in the lands of the Old Faith and in grave danger.

75
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,679
My instructions are to lead you to safety, continue through the woods, escape lies ahead.

76
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:58,360
I will be close by. Sick. Is this your fucking house? Is this like Dark Souls? It's a little

77
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:12,580
bit like Dark Souls, a little bit like Frickin' Morty. I don't know why that's so funny to me.

78
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:21,320
That's making me laugh every time. I don't know why. It's a bad joke. Somebody in chat said it,

79
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:38,360
but it's funny. All right, that's my inventory. Where's my health? Is there no HUD until I need

80
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:46,740
it? This game feels amazing to play, by the way. If you haven't got it, I would suggest you do.

81
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,110
Wait until you decide if it's worth it or not. That's what we do here on Friday Gaming Vibes.

82
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,159
We check it out. We see if it's worth your dollar. Is Call to the Lamb worth you opening up your

83
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:19,320
wallet? Stay tuned and find out on Friday Gaming Vibes. Money, money, money, one coin.

84
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:28,360
It is yet. It is. I haven't bought it yet. I'm really excited. I'm a huge Finding of Isaac fan.

85
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,720
You guys all know that. So and there's been a lot of those kind of Isaac likes, I would call them.

86
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,980
There's been quite a few. I never really got into any of the other ones besides Isaac.

87
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,120
We've nearly reached safety, but look ahead. Another poor soul about to be sacrificed.

88
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,279
Rescue them and they would have no choice but to join your new cult. I remember this.

89
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,049
Almighty bishops of the old faith, we ask you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.

90
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,809
Who interrupts our ritual and trespasses on sacred ground?

91
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:20,779
Is there a charge? Can I hold down? Probably not. Nice. This is a Morty like.

92
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,340
Hey, you know that that I think they're coming to multiverses at some point here soon.

93
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:38,299
So what if I play as Morty? Will you guys all leave? What if I play as Rick and Morty in

94
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:42,379
multiverse? What if it's like my K? What if it's a character that I just connect with?

95
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:46,299
And I'm really good with it. It's really my style. Play, play, play through style and everything.

96
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:55,080
Right. You're going to have to suffer or you won't, but you can just leave if you want to.

97
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:02,139
We've reached safety. You have done well. Red Crown will allow you to use those markings

98
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,980
in the ground to transport yourself great distances. We'll take you to a temple that

99
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,100
has fallen to ruin there. You'll be able to begin your new cult. I'll meet you there.

100
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,519
I don't think you guys would leave. I think a lot of you guys are full of shit.

101
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,070
I don't think you'd leave. You'd say you were leaving and just so like, in case the mods

102
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,990
wanted to see like check, you would leave the chat. You'd hit the X window and then open a

103
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,009
private browsing tab and come back. Just so you could tell your friends that you weren't there.

104
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:35,610
Right. Like, nah, when he, when he was playing like his Rick and Morty was pissed me off.

105
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:50,970
I left. You can check the logs I was in there. All right, cool. So now we do the town building

106
00:15:50,970 --> 00:16:01,240
section. This was in the demo. Please select the difficulty and where you can change. OK,

107
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,710
so as a as a seasoned binding of Isaac veteran, is this is this a medium or a hard game? What

108
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:26,299
should I do? No one's picking this medium sounds fine, right? It's two buttons, dude. But somebody

109
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:32,700
had an actual like a good take here. Reviews say the game is is easy. So pick a harder one.

110
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:47,940
Do you is that as accurate? I don't want to know. Not very hard. Extra hard is not that bad. I'll

111
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,100
start with hard. We'll go from there if I want to. I can up it at any time or I can lower it if I

112
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:04,740
need to. All right, let's go. OK. This crumbling ruin is said to be the site of your new cult.

113
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,309
We have much to do. We begin by indoctrinating this poor soul into the warm embrace of your cult.

114
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:23,980
They get resources for you. Order this one to collect wood and stone. Come here.

115
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:37,289
Convert me to your cult. I will follow your teachings faithfully. All right, name. No,

116
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,490
no, no. Wait, I can just make it whatever I want, right? All right. How about, um,

117
00:17:42,490 --> 00:18:06,180
aren't you, um, do Twitch integration? I think I'm not going to do it initially because I think

118
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,259
that it's they having problems with it. They took it offline for a little bit, right? And it's like

119
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:15,480
really slow. I'm definitely going to play this game more than once. I guarantee it. So we'll

120
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:34,549
turn it on another time. Uh, how about Bun Bun Bun Bob? I'm not going to name the character Morty

121
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:49,180
Bun Bob Sponge Bob. Yeah, Bun Bob choose form. Oh, oh, wait, wait. I got these because I got

122
00:18:49,180 --> 00:19:07,500
the deluxe edition, right? Well, they can't be Bun Bob if they're not a bunny. That doesn't make

123
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:33,819
any sense. OK. OK. Variant. Yep. Freights on recruiting this follower immediately gain 10

124
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:46,859
faith and generates devotion 15 percent slower. All right. That's my first one. Whatever. All

125
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:57,819
right. So go collect, um, get wood. OK. Your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live

126
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:04,410
on prayer alone that you need to eat. Gather necessary roots to build a cooking fire. Let's

127
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,049
you do meals. All right. Cool. So I need to collect. OK, let's go. I didn't chop trees down

128
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:25,460
like this. Germa, you're wormy. What do you know about me? You don't know me. You don't know me.

129
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:31,400
So don't say stuff like that. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do I know you? Do I know you?

130
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:50,329
Excuse me. It's going to take way too long. All right. Look at all this shit to build. What?

131
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,099
There's a lot of stuff here. I don't want to mess this up. I don't want to mess. I don't

132
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:03,579
want to mess this up like I messed up my cookie run kingdom town. OK. I had a terrible, awful,

133
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:13,029
awful layout for that and I uninstalled it. Uh, it should probably be down here down here.

134
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:33,960
No, that's too far away. Um, right here is OK. I'll clear this out. iPad, kid. You can move

135
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,210
things freely. OK. All right. So they need to eat. Hunger of your cult can be seen at the top left

136
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,450
of the screen. When this gets too low, followers will begin to starve. I don't want that. Find more

137
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,450
food while crusading. Grouts that pass through foraging. All right. Plant farms to grow your

138
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:58,170
own food. Seeds can be purchased or found while crusading. OK, cool. They'll collect some berry

139
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:16,549
meat and then cook a meal. They plant the berry seeds. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of this game.

140
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:24,730
I don't think I'm going to move on like such a small, like low attention span. Like you won't

141
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:44,299
even do this little part here. OK, let's go. Cool. Now we must build a shrine. We need more

142
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:51,180
followers and more gold. Go crusade. Our mutual benefactor, the one who waits, has been trapped by

143
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,819
the four bishops of the old faith. Each of them guards a chain that binds him to the realm beyond.

144
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,619
We've conjured openings to their realms that is your task to track them down and slay them

145
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:08,220
so that he may be freed. Now go. There you shall find gold and willing recruits. And for those who

146
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:19,750
are not willing, convert them by force. Go. No, this game's fucking amazing.

147
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,460
Followers deposit resources here. OK, cool. Do I have to do anything with this person?

148
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:33,559
They just. Oh, wait, I can speak to Bunbob. Make demands. I'll figure that out later.

149
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:52,380
Dude, spoiler for season six. Rick and Morty. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I forgot.

150
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:58,970
OK, Jerry. I'm sorry I said that earlier. I know that like a lot of people were upset that I

151
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:18,619
spoiled season six. All right. Darkwood. Cool. So this for place to go. What are you doing?

152
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:36,009
What was that? Godly blood was spilled here to death. No longer wish to wait. OK, let's go.

153
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,369
Don't make this a Rick and Morty joke stream. It deserves better. I won't.

154
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,460
It's not I. I'm reacting to chat right now. It's nothing to do with me.

155
00:24:49,259 --> 00:25:04,170
OK, cool. Well balanced blade dealing moderate damage. I didn't enter the lands of the bishop

156
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,329
Leshy. Those who do not follow the ways of the old faith will be destroyed.

157
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:17,849
Let's go. We need more gold and we need more followers. Oh, should I have health now? All

158
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:35,140
right. Don't mess it up. We're good. Three coins and some hearts. You're more of a family guy

159
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:48,460
streamer. Um, I don't know. Am I going to Luigi's Mansion this game? Am I going to cut literally

160
00:25:48,460 --> 00:26:12,009
everything down and not some of the slowest player of this game? Meow. You will get stuff if you do,

161
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:17,799
but it's not a constant drop. So it's worth doing. So I should keep doing it. I'll keep doing it.

162
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:25,210
It's me stuff. Somebody said you're like something like the Sopranos. All right. Is this

163
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,130
stream more like the Sopranos? Am I the Sopranos of Twitch or am I the family guy streamer?

164
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,859
You're the George Lopez of Twitch. I don't know what that means.

165
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:59,769
Is that an insult or is that like a good thing? Do people like George Lopez?

166
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:15,619
I thought George Lopez is as like a TV show and as a comedian, right? I'm going to go this way.

167
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:23,700
You're the Big Bang Theory of Twitch. No, I am not. No, I'm not. That's absolute horseshit and

168
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:33,400
you know it. You just said that to make me mad. The card showed me once many lifetimes ago,

169
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,339
or is it yet to be? I've always drawn your cards, lamb. And yet this is the first.

170
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:56,420
You're the young Sheldon of Twitch. Okay. Take these cards and I will grant. I will draw another

171
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,960
each time we meet. When drawn by me, they will grant you a power. Power? Well, that's both known

172
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,759
and unknown. The cards will decide that. Okay. A heart offered, a vow made or receive double

173
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:16,140
the health when healing. What is this one? Is that a spirit heart? Why would I be the Big Bang Theory?

174
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:25,500
Nothing I say. None of the jokes I make are Big Bang Theory kind of jokes. When was the last time

175
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,720
you heard me talk about a like physicist joke or like a joke about the cosmos or something or like

176
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,589
a math joke? I don't make those here. I don't ever talk about that stuff. I hate that stuff.

177
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:57,289
All those topics I dislike. Is this a spirit heart? No. Yes. I'll take double the health.

178
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:08,009
That sounds better. You hate the cosmos. No, I'm talking about like math jokes. I don't,

179
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:16,519
I don't, I'm not a math person. All right. Goodbye. I think you're more the Frazier of Twitch.

180
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:27,019
No, I don't think so. No, no, no, no. That's incorrect. I don't want to die in the tutorial

181
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:59,829
zone. What do you mean true? Isn't Frazier like super intellectual and, all right, there we go.

182
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:05,579
I need health. Wired feather necklace imbued with the vitality of a bird.

183
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:13,140
Follower will have increased movement speed. Okay. Are these permanent? I don't have a follower

184
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:36,970
though. I have no health. Can I eat this? What if I, I'm going to die here. Let's get more food.

185
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:46,470
Is this medium? This is no, it's not hard. Oh, okay. It's a lot of vegetables here.

186
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:53,589
Oh, this is perfect. Okay. Oh, this is perfect. Oh, let me say this. Oh, this is, oh, oh,

187
00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:19,369
sentence. Oh, sentence. You're the Lunchables of Twitch. Incredibly convenient. Tastes great

188
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:39,779
and can fit anywhere. Um, okay. That's, I'm very versatile. How did I not find any health?

189
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,579
No, I'm not saying that's what me directly. I'm just saying that in general, Lunchables are very

190
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,500
convenient. They, they, they, they don't, they don't taste bad. They're fine. And they can,

191
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,380
you can take them anywhere and nobody complains. If you, okay, I'm going to tell you right now,

192
00:31:57,339 --> 00:32:03,500
if I were to be in a room, like a conference room with like 10 executives, it doesn't matter.

193
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,900
Like 10, like multi-billion dollar executives. And they're talking about, oh, this is what we're

194
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,779
going to do. This is, this is, these are the expensive cigars and cigarettes. We're going

195
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:16,779
to smoke later. Oh, was that a 10,000 year old Scotch? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What year is that one,

196
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:25,660
John? If I was in that room and I pulled out a Lunchables and I opened it, everyone would hear

197
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,539
the tear and they would, everyone would fucking be obsessed with it. Everyone would want a piece.

198
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:38,220
They, they would all go, wow, you got Lunchables. Oh, sick. Everyone would be so happy. It doesn't

199
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:46,890
matter. Everybody loves Lunchables. And then one of the executives that do, oh shit, dude,

200
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,329
what a fucking psycho. He would be like, let me see, give me, give me. He would take the cracker,

201
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:58,089
ham, cheese, cracker, ham, cheese, cracker, ham, cheese, cracker. And everyone around him,

202
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,369
everyone's going to be like, dude, slow down, dude. Oh, he's going fucking crazy.

203
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,650
And he would try to get the whole thing in his mouth and we would all clap and laugh.

204
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:22,680
I don't know. I need help. You did that on stream like eight years ago. Did I do a

205
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:52,019
Lunchables stack? No, I didn't. I did. I literally did. What? Hold on. Was this Lunchables though?

206
00:33:52,019 --> 00:34:08,760
You can't go in like that. Hold on a second. I think you can go inside.

207
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:34,179
Man is going to choke on stream. Stop. Why do I have no emotion doing this? What's wrong with me?

208
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:58,920
Here, give that to me. He doesn't take it out of my mouth, does he? Oh, well, that was,

209
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,900
that was actually like, if you're going to throw up your face, that was like,

210
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm moving weirdly enough where it's going to come up. You can't go in like that.

211
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,320
I think you can go inside. Are they Oreos? Why would I do it

212
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:18,139
long ways by the way? What the fuck was I doing? That's amateur move right there. That was amateur.

213
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:26,409
What an amateur. You don't do it long ways. You do it, you move vertical. What are you doing?

214
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:46,039
What an idiot. I forgot where I would play. Whatever. It's fine. I forgot where I was.

215
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:58,119
All right. Fear not. Hold on a second. Let me move this back where it was. Okay.

216
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,619
I should allow fire still need you. Take what you have gathered, build and strengthen the cult.

217
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,179
This is how power is gained. Continue on undaunted. Each time you are brought down,

218
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:17,480
you rise stronger. You included the Oreos. I don't know. I don't know why I did that.

219
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:29,179
We were drinking. We were downing beers. That stream. Oh yeah. But still, why would you go

220
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:37,369
like horizontal? It's vertical. Okay. So I have, um, I make some more food. I don't have any

221
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:45,369
followers. So what else can I build? All right. I just gotta get back in there.

222
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:59,659
Should I cook more food? What do you guys think? 15% chance of pooping instantly. Um,

223
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,750
can I eat these? No, I can't. So they'll just be, he can just eat it whenever he wants.

224
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,539
Food will spoil by the way. Oh shit. Okay. Pop left to see how hungry. Okay. Well,

225
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:32,389
it's all right. All right. Let's go. Why run out of room in my inventory? Or is it infinite?

226
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:48,949
No. All right. Sick. That's a new weapon. Apostates cleaver. High damage and a little slower.

227
00:37:49,670 --> 00:38:07,239
That is slow. This is a good weapon. This is an ungodly weapon.

228
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:35,340
Ooh, this is actually kind of fun. Regular sword is better. This thing has huge cleave though.

229
00:38:36,059 --> 00:39:02,570
The small rooms. This is great. Don't hit me. Nice. Yeah. There are secret rooms,

230
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:19,719
tinted rocks, tinted rock secret areas, right? There probably has to be. The cleave is so huge.

231
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:35,320
What happened? What's going on? How can this be? You were put to the blade, lamb, as all your kind

232
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:43,530
were. And yet here you stand before me unrepentant. Crown his power. Could it be? But I am stronger

233
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:52,380
still. Turn tail and run little lamb. Mini boss? No, I think that's the main boss of the act.

234
00:39:55,449 --> 00:40:03,050
All right. What do you got? Overall weapon damage increased by 1.2 times.

235
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,179
Almost as much as the Wii was stronger than the GameCube. Remember that? You guys remember

236
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:20,219
hearing that? And how much that pissed everybody off initially? The Wii was 1.2 times faster than

237
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:26,579
the GameCube. And people were like, what? And then it sold like 100 million units. I remember

238
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,780
reading that initial report and being like, you got to be fucking kidding me, Nintendo. What are

239
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:36,550
you doing? Mistake flop. Things going to be a piece of shit. And I think like, like a third

240
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:47,050
of all households on earth own a Wii. So I was wrong. Yeah, it's definitely worth that.

241
00:40:47,050 --> 00:41:04,380
More damage. Hell yeah. Let's not get hit. Okay. And statue of the mighty lamb. Oh, cool. Okay.

242
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:21,460
I need a temple. Did it? That's cool. So this is just decoration. Are you ever right?

243
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:31,619
Okay. I was right about Bitcoin. I bought Bitcoin when it was a dollar and I sold it when it got to

244
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:46,070
a dollar too. All of it. So, you know, I was right about that, I guess. Thanks for the fucking

245
00:41:46,070 --> 00:42:03,340
reminder. Always bet against Jerma. No, why would you? Excuse me. Don't ever bet against Jerma.

246
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Don't ever bet against me. Cause you know what? I might surprise you. Hey, I might surprise you

247
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,760
today. You know what? I kind of want a compilation of all the times I've done something and said,

248
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,250
you know what? I think I might surprise some of you guys today. And then just show the me walking

249
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:51,849
into grenades and stuff. That damage is awesome. You're predictable. Um, I feel like I'm some

250
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:58,539
things I am, but a lot of things I'm not. Like if I was so predictable, when's the next time

251
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:03,699
I'm going to tweet. That's not a I'm live tweet. You know what I'm saying? Like when am I going to

252
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:26,440
tweet again for real? Go ahead and predict that thing is doing a lot of damage. Whoa.

253
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:48,489
Ooh. Crusaders blade too. Oh, let me try it out. It's faster, but do I want it? I don't think it's

254
00:43:48,489 --> 00:44:17,449
worth it. Yeah, I'm keeping the act. That guy. You come far enough. My followers are willing to do

255
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:22,789
anything for me. Can you say the same of yours? I give myself to the cause. Oh, mighty leader.

256
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:44,840
By the blood of the great ones, destroy the red crown. I'm who see us. Whoa. Don't get overwhelmed.

257
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:12,260
Oh, now you're going to be my follower, right? Please spare me. Convert me to your call. I will

258
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:26,329
follow your teachings. Come here. And then eight, not eight, six berry bush seeds, 16 berries.

259
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:40,019
Um, I don't know what's better. Just the regular berries and, oh, that's a lot of money.

260
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:58,309
Nice. Very cool. You should have taken the seeds. Oh, well, I want to say, let me check this seeds.

261
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:13,820
Grow the berries. You goofy ass. Let it came down here. Hmm. I feel like this would be worth it.

262
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:40,119
If it was too goofy. Oh, I said goofy ass. What are you going to lose these? Uh, what mods? What's

263
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:48,519
going on? What am I missing here? Anybody in mod chat? What's what am I missing? What's going on?

264
00:46:49,159 --> 00:47:06,820
It's a meme. They say, lol, I don't know. What? Uh, no clue. I'm lost. I'm just as lost as you are.

265
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:29,610
Actually goofy. Uh, don't tell them. Is it? I don't get it. What? It's a meme. It's a current meme.

266
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:49,000
All right, let's go for it. It's time to win. Wait, I can return to, oh, it's locked. Why is it locked?

267
00:47:49,480 --> 00:48:15,019
Did I do everything? Oh, okay. Cool. Boomer doesn't realize his chat is all under 25.

268
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:30,500
Oh, okay. All right. Very good. My vessel. It seems I chose well when I kept you from death.

269
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:44,789
I'll be watching your every move. Do not disappoint me. Your viewer base is five to 10 at this point.

270
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:59,539
Nobody that's five to 10 years old is on Twitch. I'm sorry. I don't agree. That's no, that no, no,

271
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:03,619
no. That's not even, that's not even Fortnite guys. That's not Fortnite age. Stop saying Fortnite.

272
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:18,980
No, maybe if you said like 12 or something, that's not Fortnite. Nope. You know how I,

273
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:27,219
I am certain I am 1 million percent positive that because so I have nieces and nephews and I can

274
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:32,019
tell like what that whole age group cares about just based on the things that my siblings tell me

275
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:37,289
and things that I see my nieces and nephews do. I know what they're into now. And I'll tell you,

276
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:51,769
it's not, it's not Twitch. When you have five, it's not, you're not on Twitch.

277
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:19,050
All right. Let's bring this new person in. Please spare me. Anecdote Andy. Dude, when you,

278
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:25,860
I'm trying to think of like the world when you're five, you can't even fucking read at five.

279
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:36,219
You can't even read. What are you talking about? You just barely are like learning how to read

280
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,989
at like four years old, five years old. You're not like reading books. You could. Yeah. All right.

281
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:49,159
Sorry. All right. Yeah. Sam, I am. I do not like green eggs and ham. They're not sitting here

282
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:55,139
typing like omega low. Like streamers sucks in the chat. They're not here. They're not writing

283
00:50:55,139 --> 00:51:12,630
like copy pasta paragraphs here. It's not how it works. All right. What do I want this person to

284
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:55,269
be named? How about green? Um, wart, rash, puke, punk, oil. Um, gremlin, gremel, gremel, gremel,

285
00:51:55,269 --> 00:52:11,769
gremel, gremel, gremel, grimace. No, you can stay there. Uh, I like the color is fine, but this is

286
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:30,150
bad. I just five, this person doesn't have any good traits. Um, you go get stoned because I already

287
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,260
have somebody cutting trees down. Followers will either work or worship. Worshipping followers

288
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:42,579
generate devotion for you to collect, but to collect it, you require a shrine, build it,

289
00:52:43,219 --> 00:53:06,900
statue, shrine. Okay. Um, I can, I can have, I have to put it here. Let's work.

290
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:16,199
Praise be your followers can now worship you. There's a new follower. Assign them to worship

291
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:20,119
at the shrine and collect the devotion. Your followers generated the shrine to unlock divine

292
00:53:20,119 --> 00:54:00,940
inspiration. Oh, new follower authority. I kind of like authority authority. The pig with the hair

293
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:08,059
on recruiting follower immediately lose 10 faith yields 15% faster when sickened and in bed rest.

294
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:24,119
Okay. Go worship. So you collect this more followers worshiping at your shrine, the faster

295
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,159
they will fill up. The shrine is full. They will be stopped until it is emptied. Once you've

296
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:33,079
collected divine inspiration, unlock new buildings. Ooh, that's how you do that. Okay. Cool.

297
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:43,099
Um, all of you actually go worship. I can do this bullshit. You know what I mean? I can do this.

298
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:55,460
You guys do that. I can't do that. Come here. Anybody have food? I'll finish this. You go do

299
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:12,440
that. All right. I need a temple. Who wants coffee? Oh, there's still food here. That's fine.

300
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:29,480
All right. We're good. Oh, it wants me to finish this part. Okay. Take it. Divine inspiration

301
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:40,139
unlocked. Um, my God. Okay. Just turn in the path of exile. So what do I want to go from here?

302
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:57,300
Sleeping bags. Unlock. Oh, establish a temple. All right. Farm plot or sleeping. Probably farm.

303
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:15,059
Yeah. Farm plot. I need some divine inspiration. Temple. Uh, this will go down. Let's put it away.

304
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:34,539
Like down here. The music slaps. It does. Yeah. It is pretty good. Why are you ignoring chat?

305
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:41,239
Who said I've been doing that? Like on the right stick. Your Twitch integration. No.

306
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,909
Temple is center of your cult. From there, you will preach sermons to grow stronger and

307
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:55,369
perform rituals to mold the fragile minds of your followers. You need to maintain the faith of your

308
00:56:55,369 --> 00:57:00,619
cult. If it falls too low, your followers will dissent against you and eventually leave. They're

309
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:04,139
ready to hear your word. Show them that you are their great leader. Preach a sermon.

310
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:14,809
Oh, okay. All right. Everyone come on here. I'm going to give you a classic Bart Simpson.

311
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:28,969
Rub it up, Deb. Thanks for the grub. Bart! Oh Homer, it's okay. Okay. Perform a sermon.

312
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,510
Drawing energy from your followers to bolster the power of the red crown.

313
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:46,900
Oh, stop. Give me a break. It wasn't the impression I was trying to do. It was the

314
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,199
cadence I was doing and the nostalgia of you remembering the episode. That's it. I wasn't

315
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,440
being like, okay, here comes my good impression of Homer and Bart and Marge. No, that was a

316
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,570
cadence for you to remember the nostalgic properties of the episode. Now you're going

317
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:18,679
to get timed out if you keep this up. They liked it. Performing sermons will draw power from them

318
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:23,929
and allow you to unlock new abilities, weapons, and curses. Followers with a higher loyalty level

319
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:31,940
will generate more devotion. All right. So we have to do this a lot. Oh my God. There's more.

320
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:45,590
Oh shit. Nice. What's your favorite 10 commandment? Thou shalt not steal. Leave my shit alone.

321
00:58:48,539 --> 00:59:00,469
Do it again. Okay. God your cult. You need to declare doctrine so that they might obey you.

322
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:06,099
Turn to the lands of the old faith and seek out commandment stone fragments. With these,

323
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:23,050
you'll be able to declare new doctrines. Okay. What about thou shalt not kill?

324
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:35,130
Thou shalt not steal is like the first one I thought of. What are the 10 commandments

325
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:41,659
off the top of my head? Let me see if I can get this. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal.

326
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:52,699
Thou don't, don't help me. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit

327
00:59:52,699 --> 01:00:13,050
adultery. Right? Thou shalt not. What are the other ones? Only three commandments. No, no, no.

328
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:21,619
Okay. Mel Brooks had this joke and it was an unbelievable joke. He's playing as Moses,

329
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:25,960
right, with the commandments and he goes up to all the followers that are out there waiting to hear

330
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,480
him. He comes back with the boy. He has the commandments in his hands and he comes over

331
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,599
with these three big slabs and they're all waiting for him to talk and they're just like,

332
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:35,559
oh there he is, Moses. And he walks up with these three halves and he's like,

333
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:43,800
yes, I have seen God and we have spoken. What I have for you here, the most important I have.

334
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,760
And he drops one of the slabs and it fucking shatters on the ground. He says, I have 15.

335
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:55,980
The thing falls, it shatters on the ground. Then he goes, oh, 10 commandments. Can we watch it?

336
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,500
Let's watch it right now. It's a classic fucking piece of comedy. It really is.

337
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:13,530
Let's just watch it. How long is it? It's like 15 seconds long. It's so good. It's

338
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,780
truly like a genius bit. You can't go in like that. I think you can go inside.

339
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:44,340
Okay, here we go. It's so funny. I shall give these laws. Hear me. It's given unto you.

340
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:04,260
Oh, it's so good. Like what were the other five? What were the other five? Oh, it's classic.

341
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:19,400
Like those must have been important, right? All right, so now we plant.

342
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:30,630
The volume was too low. Oh, it's all right. Those are DLC. Yo, dude, when we're going to

343
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:50,389
get a baby food stream? You're weird. That's a weird thing to ask. Okay, I can plant.

344
01:02:51,510 --> 01:03:00,739
I can do actually farming now, right? Okay. Oh, shit. It's a bunch of grass.

345
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:12,860
Wait. All right. The farm's going to be over here on the left. Put it in a diamond shape.

346
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:43,099
Oh, come on. I ruined it. Did I do too many? Do a baby food tier list.

347
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,739
I don't know, man. That's one of those ideas that starts out funny.

348
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:58,360
And then in practice is like, I'm not comfortable right now. Like the baby sensory stream. That's

349
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:03,000
a funny thing to think of and go, wow, that's funny to think about. But doing it in practice,

350
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:21,179
it's like, this is making me uncomfortable. Okay, so water. This is sick. You actually

351
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:35,000
have like a whole thing like this. All right, so then add fertilizer. Oh, I need shit.

352
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:54,260
Do they shit? Are they shitting? No, no, don't clean it. Pick it up on sanitary conditions

353
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,679
that your cult will cause your followers to get sick. If a follower becomes sick, assign them

354
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:05,849
to bed rest or they could die. Okay. OOP vomit and dead bodies cause illness to spread quickly

355
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:10,090
throughout your cult. Cleaning messes and burying bodies will prevent the spread of illness. Oh,

356
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:37,579
my God, what? That was weird. Like immediate. Disgusting. Okay, so I need more. All right,

357
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:49,880
this is fun. Well, let's keep going. Everyone can, everyone's good, right? I need a deadly

358
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:56,170
sins tier list. You mean like in order of which one I think is the worst or the, well, what do

359
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:27,929
you mean? Ooh, no, it needs to be by full metal alchemist characters. Oh, come on. FMA characters.

360
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,440
Okay, the one who waits is pleased with your progress and wishes to grant you a crown ability.

361
01:06:40,300 --> 01:07:01,530
Thanks. Hmm. Ooh, so there's a, oh, it's perfect, right? Hit it right in the middle.

362
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:10,420
That's fun. Enemies you slay will now drop fervor. Collect this to replenish your curses.

363
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:16,780
All right. Righteous anger earned by striking down non-believers and works like ammunition

364
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:23,380
for your curses. Fervor will drop when you slay an enemy collecting it refuels your curses.

365
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:33,659
You ever heard about the Bible story where the kids bully a bald guy and they get mauled by a bear?

366
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:41,829
I can't say I've caught up with my Bible history or Bible verses in a long time, man.

367
01:07:43,530 --> 01:08:20,619
Okay. Ooh, old nuggets. What's this? It's time of day matter. I probably shouldn't be using that

368
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:36,779
on these guys, right? Do you drink shower water? No. I open my mouth with the shower water go in,

369
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:42,779
fill my mouth enough where it overflows from inside. I just hold my mouth open and it goes,

370
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:46,699
fill, fill, fill, fill, fill, and then goes over the sides. And then I spit it all out.

371
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:10,380
Ow. Oh shit. Okay. These guys are weird. Oh my God. I'm getting destroyed in this one.

372
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:19,060
I have to pay more attention. All right. I got to pay attention. Pay more attention, please.

373
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:30,020
You have good tap water. No, I don't, I wouldn't, I don't know if I would drink

374
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:46,039
the Vegas tap water. No, I don't, I'm not, I'm not into that. Go down. What's up here?

375
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,890
Oh shit. Wait, go back, back, back. No, I don't want to go there yet. How do I get over there?

376
01:10:06,859 --> 01:10:16,869
Use the map. Oh, it's not, okay. It's not connected. That's why. See how the little thing,

377
01:10:16,869 --> 01:10:19,989
the little tag on the bottom is not connected. I thought for some reason I couldn't get that way.

378
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:31,340
Don't you have a filter? Yeah. Still, I wouldn't, I wouldn't just drink just regular tap water.

379
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:48,250
It freaks me out. It just does. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't like, I don't know.

380
01:10:48,810 --> 01:11:03,100
I don't like the way tap water smells. You know, when you put like tap water up to your mouth and

381
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:09,180
you kind of can smell that like chloriney kind of smell. No, it's like that. It's,

382
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:40,779
it's got a very specific smell to it. What is this? Go find out. Okay. Ooh. Okay. I only hit one of

383
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:48,739
them. Enjoy the rest of your dinner. Oh, I think I really hurt that guy. Okay. Salmon.

384
01:11:49,460 --> 01:12:01,300
Berry seed. Let's do salmon. How much is this free? Is it free? Stop. Just how do I get him to stop

385
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:13,029
doing that? This is free. All this is free if I go in here and do this. Oops. I honestly did not

386
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:27,880
think that was anything alive. I thought that was just like a house. Okay. Cool. What's over here?

387
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:46,729
Whoa. Um, cool. This way. New follower. The worm it is hungry. It feeds. It partakes of our flesh,

388
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:58,329
but that is the price for safety for that. We gladly give it all we have. That's why these

389
01:12:58,329 --> 01:13:05,930
guys were freaking me out because they, they do the, they do the fin from multiverses. Swing already.

390
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:44,739
Do it. Are there iframes? Can I dodge through people? Good. All right. What do you have for

391
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:53,930
magical powers? Cool. Find commandment stone fragments, which are there on the map somewhere?

392
01:13:55,050 --> 01:14:18,729
Oh, there's meat. What are your current thoughts on multiverses? Give me that mic.

393
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:24,250
Here's what I think about multiverses. You already know what I think about multiverses. Don't ask.

394
01:14:38,409 --> 01:15:09,029
Steal devotion. Sure. Okay. Break. Is it bad? Oh, champion. Champion. Foolishly persist little

395
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:14,710
lamb. I hear your lies and I smell your fear. The red frown rises again, but what an unworthy

396
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:33,189
bearer it has. Crack a quest. Oh, no, I don't want to do that right now. But it stumps too.

397
01:15:33,750 --> 01:16:10,380
That's pretty cool. Oh, I thought I had power. Didn't roll. All right. That was funny.

398
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:17,300
When attacked 10% chance of negating damage or deals poison damage. Yeah. This one that's for

399
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:33,130
the fast swing should be cool, right? That power can probably change, I'm assuming, right?

400
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:45,659
This is a tablet fragment. We've been good. Give us face cam. All right.

401
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,270
Wow. I got more lighting in here and I look at how greasy and gross I look.

402
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:13,779
My hair looks like it came out of the oven and it's done. This looks like cooked hair.

403
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:25,020
My hair looked different. Like it's done now. It's ready. Okay. What befell this pantheon?

404
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,300
Alas, this is the nature of beasts to forget and of gods to be forgotten.

405
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:34,859
We'll get shiny. I should probably wash my face. Yeah, I'm going to wash my face after this.

406
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:39,779
All right. May have they left, may have they slept, may have they devoured and were devoured

407
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:43,699
in turn. Those few who remain spread roots, spun webs, molded this world to meet their men, theirs.

408
01:17:46,710 --> 01:18:08,729
Many gods, hundreds. You found enough fragments to form a commandment stone.

409
01:18:09,939 --> 01:18:12,819
These are used to declare new doctrines for your cult to follow.

410
01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:18,579
Use the altar in your temple to declare a new doctrine so that I can change the sermons.

411
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:26,439
It's kind of cool. Cooked turkey hair. Don't you feel like if you just took a piece of this

412
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:33,750
off and like it would be delicious? All right. Whoa. One, two. And then he goes,

413
01:18:35,770 --> 01:19:19,500
wow. One, two. And then he goes, oh, you idiot. I'll get greedy. It's four. You get four and that's

414
01:19:19,500 --> 01:20:06,260
it. Oh, whoa. Four times. All right. Use the curse shot. Not enough time, man.

415
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:20,970
German name one more commitment or I'm going to stop watching. I'm actually going to try.

416
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:28,279
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not

417
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:36,539
commit trespasses. Thou shalt forgive trespasses against us. Thou shalt. I actually really don't

418
01:20:36,539 --> 01:21:02,390
know the ten of these. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not. Oh, it's not a bunch

419
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:09,189
of knots. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Right.

420
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:21,819
There's other things you can't you should do. Right. Thou shalt thou shalt eat a balanced

421

01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:43,510
neighbor. Thou shalt drink water. Thou shalt drink eight ounces of water every two hours or something.

423
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:54,199
Thou shalt always bathe and never be on stream with a fucking cooked turkey hair. Did I get one?

424
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:02,439
That's too much water. I know that eight ounces of water every. You're supposed to eat eight

425
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:18,250
glasses of water a day. Right. Thou shalt thou shalt not too much. I don't know. Did I actually get

426
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:27,079
one? Thou shalt treat each other with respect or something along those lines. I'm just gonna look

427
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:54,310
them up. Okay. Ten commandments. How do I not know these? Ten commandments. Okay. Thou shalt not worship

428
01:22:54,310 --> 01:23:03,609
false gods. I am the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods. Never take my name in vain. You shall

429
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:10,060
keep the Sabbath day holy. Honor your mother and father. You shalt not kill. You shalt not commit

430
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:26,760
adultery. You shall not steal. Okay so the other ones were I just I was thinking of um so honor

431
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:36,729
your father and mother. Hey I I always do I I say call your mother every day so I knew one. So I knew

432
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:51,899
it. Does that count? Okay so it's like don't have uh no false gods no other yeah I just I don't know

433
01:23:51,899 --> 01:24:01,449
why I was thinking that they would like instable direct like you do not do this. Do this. Uh follower

434
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:12,979
form. Yeah I don't need batteries. Let's get a follower. Oh cool. Losing viewers. I'm not no

435
01:24:12,979 --> 01:24:20,100
no I'm not you guys that you it doesn't even update that fast. Every time somebody says oh dude

436
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:24,819
you you blend like a thousand viewers. Dude it doesn't it updates like every two to three minutes.

437
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:45,350
You you don't know that. Hey guys let's leave. Let's all leave. Do you have a skincare routine?

438
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:50,630
I don't. Trust me you don't want to know it today because I didn't do anything. Just didn't take a

439
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:59,779
shower. I I probably should take a quick shower. Did I? Your faith is a resource spend it as you

440
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:02,979
would gold where you can always regain their trust with a well-placed gesture of kindness.

441
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:21,500
I give you power to read their minds. Okay so I can see what they want. You've declared a

442
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:34,260
doctrine which has granted you a new follower action. Okay take a quick shower but leave the

443
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:39,460
stream on. I might actually do that. Not right now but in a little bit before we do two point campus.

444
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:45,960
All right cool. How's everybody doing? It's it's kind of getting overgrown here isn't it?

445
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:52,520
You got a problem? Great leader the cult is growing by the day. It is time you gave it a name.

446
01:25:53,079 --> 01:26:40,729
Sure my might. It's good to me. It's good to me. Oh water. Yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna take a shower

447
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:51,079
in between changing game. Is that weird? And on the BRB screen I'm just gonna put. Well I won't

448
01:26:51,079 --> 01:27:02,899
spoil. Is that TOS? Can I do that? All right if I put just on the BRB screen just a running water

449
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:10,659
shower the kind of just like oh shower sound like and have just like stock audio of a guy going like

450
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:42,699
can I do that? Uh definitely sleep. So I can make beds now. How much does this cost?

451
01:27:43,340 --> 01:28:06,090
These are expensive. I'll do three. Three is fine. What happened to your BRB art screen? Uh they were

452
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:11,819
thousands of images and more and more kept pouring in every week and we were never going to be able

453
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:20,390
to show them. And I only stream like two or three times a week. Not possible. Just was impossible.

454
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:42,520
It was physically not possible. Bunbob lives here. Rumble lives here. Yeah for those that don't know

455
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:49,050
I used to have a BRB art screen that would show like 10 to 20 pieces of art and we ran to the

456
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:57,850
problem where it was just we were months and months behind. So you would see images on that screen

457
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:02,489
from like a reference from like six months ago. And it got to the point where we had too many

458
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:09,050
where it was just never ever going to be physically ever possible. And I could have like the only way

459
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:14,250
I could have really caught up was if for like two or three straight days for like six to ten hours

460
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:20,470
for three four days just show a drawing on screen for five seconds. But why would I do that?

461
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:25,510
That just at that point that's just like showing it just to like get it over with.

462
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:32,100
I don't I don't want to do that. That would that just feels like well I don't want to do that.

463
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:42,489
So there's a there's a fan art channel in the discord that is tons of people use it. This is

464
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:53,449
a creative channel in the discord tons of people use it. That's where it is. What do you want? I'm

465
01:29:53,449 --> 01:30:02,789
famished. We don't what do you mean you don't have food? What do you mean? How do you not have food?

466
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:12,180

467
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:27,819

I have to recruit the new guy. Well hold on. I need to make sure he has a place to sleep.

472

Okay so you come on in. Convert me. Dimple. You can keep this for him. Okay so I want you to um

475
01:32:48,739 --> 01:33:09,510
Cool easy to level up but okay so we don't want this person ever doing uh faith or devotion stuff.

476
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:19,590
These names are lazy. Half the guys you want you want me to give the cool names to the people

477
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:30,739
that are going to die in like 40 minutes. Why would I do that? Wait wait wait you have a bed

478
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:45,829
over here. No no no I got it. I got it over here. This is yours. All right so do I have to sleep too

479
01:33:45,829 --> 01:34:00,789
or do I not sleep? Okay uh decorations. They wanted some decorations. I'll put this one here.

484
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:16,680
cult grows. Okay bad chat. Boring. Must avoid them in the future. I agree. Good chat. I had

485
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:32,250
a great conversation with a fellow cult member. Okay rude. Somebody was rude to them in chat.

486
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:44,140
All right I need one more decoration. Is twitch integration? Yeah I know I'm not I don't have it

487
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:48,949

498
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:12,039
Destroy their skeleton. Oh all right. Perform rituals in the temple. These usually raise faith

499
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:17,239
or help you solve problems. Rituals are performed using the bones of your fallen

500
01:39:17,239 --> 01:39:26,119
enemies. Spiders. After slaying a non-believer dis-crate their bodies to gather their bones.

501
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:51,270
All right let's do a sermon though. Second. Bane weapons. Curse of three new curses will appear on

505
01:40:45,989 --> 01:41:02,859

506
01:41:06,869 --> 01:41:27,560
Please come back. No I I'm not I'm not gone. Please do Mr. Satan voice. I can do that

01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:33,770
for a new follower of course I can. Well new followers. And make sure you say hi.

508
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:50,010
That person just followed. Every new follower I do that. All right I'm gonna I'm gonna go

509
01:41:50,010 --> 01:42:04,520
adventure. Everybody happy? Uh I'm gonna make some food. Here if you're hungry you go ahead and eat

510
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:25,270

511
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:34,729
mouths to feed you must need some seeds. Okay. Okay I don't think I need it right now.

512
01:42:35,289 --> 01:42:48,359
This game is awesome. This game is genuinely really fun. Whoa traders razor or hounds of

513
01:42:48,359 --> 01:43:24,140
bait. Yeah. Oh I can take both? Wait oh I see. Oh camellia. Uh oh. So it is true the red crown

514
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:30,979
sits upon the brow of another. Ha we did everything we could. It matters not. We need not bother

515
01:43:30,979 --> 01:43:43,779
Shamura with this. Deal with it brother. See come at. Whoa. All right stop being an idiot.

516
01:43:44,340 --> 01:44:18,619
All right how do I get how do I do the bone thing? No no notice something about the game.

517
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:26,729
You can't mash. I guess maybe you can. You have to get the timing right to swing because if I go

518
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:34,819
like I guess it is that way. Okay I think you have to just like mash to keep it in succession

519
01:44:34,819 --> 01:44:45,479
because if I don't mash it gets the combo gets caught. What about the bones? How do I do? Oh

520
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:54,119
you just break it. Okay and I didn't know if it was special. The game slows down when you connect

521
01:44:54,119 --> 01:45:41,899
the hit. Match some shampoo into your hair. Okay. Oh nice. Hey I thought you I thought that was a

522
01:45:41,899 --> 01:46:02,810
follower. I didn't think that was an enemy. You look like a retired porn star. Whatever you say.

523
01:46:03,449 --> 01:46:20,890
Hi Mr. Raid automated. Thank you automated for the raid. Appreciate it. I don't know when that

524
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:33,590
was. I think it was a while ago. Welcome. Thank you auto. Poison damage nice. You left the heart.

525
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:54,260
I was looking at chat. I want to look at more stuff over here. I'll come back once I'm done

526
01:46:54,260 --> 01:47:03,689
from the shower. 10% crit. Yeah although that's really good too. No I want the crit for sure.

527
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:34,039
More damage. Bones. I know I'm breaking everything. I'm taking so much longer.

528
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:43,510
Heard you shower every five years. Honestly I know people say like oh yeah I don't you know

529
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:49,590
I don't like wash my hair like all the time or once a week. If I do not take a shower every day

530
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:58,489
I am disgusting. Disgusting. I don't know. I must just be a gross person.

531
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:07,109
I'm so sweaty and greasy every day. If I do not take a shower every day

532
01:48:07,989 --> 01:48:16,779
I am I am absolutely revolting to be around. I don't know maybe some people don't generate

533
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:51,829
as much filth as I do or something. Poison's great. Maybe it's your mayo and peanut butter diet.

534
01:48:52,470 --> 01:49:07,420
Peanut butter is all right. I'm not going to listen to this slander. Peanut butter is really

535
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:13,779
good for you. It's so good for you. There's so many health benefits of just really good real

536
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:26,220
peanut butter. Get that get that slander out of this chat. Not if that's the only thing you eat.

537
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:32,539
I don't turn the stream off and go get a spoon and sit there and eat

538
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:39,029
crunchy peanut butter out of a jar and go that's it. Oh all of my nutrients. I'm not like Super

539
01:49:39,029 --> 01:49:44,789
Mario. I don't just eat big mushrooms and then like go to that's not how it works.

540
01:49:44,789 --> 01:49:55,989
It's not I don't have the Super Mario diet guys. It's not mushrooms and cake. The only thing Mario

541
01:49:55,989 --> 01:50:01,989
eats in the entire series of Mario Brothers is the cake at the end and a bunch of mushrooms

542
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:08,220
and spaghetti. Yeah but that is that cannon though? I don't know if that's cannon.

543
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:40,010
Is it cannon? And he eats flowers too. You got some spaghetti on your overalls. Oh fuck you Luigi.

544
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:58,579
Yeah I've seen it. I think everyone's seen that video. Be honest are you actually Mario? Um no.

545
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:11,220
No. I don't have full health. You like partially hydrogenated or natural peanut butter.

546
01:51:12,649 --> 01:51:18,729
They're I mean they they're natural good peanut butter where when you look at it

547
01:51:19,529 --> 01:51:28,680
it's like watery on top. That's the good stuff. Now just a regular skippy peanut butter is so good

548
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:35,340
if you want. It's almost like a dessert peanut butter but the one with like the peanut oil on

549
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:47,670
the top it's oh man it is gold. That's gross. Yeah it's peanut oil. Skippy peanut butter is

550
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:56,729
is like a dessert peanut butter for me. Natural peanut butter with the oil that settles and you

551
01:51:56,729 --> 01:52:01,529
have to mix it up a little bit or I'm telling you man sometimes I just scoop in there and I get

552
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:04,489
a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit of the top layer of the peanut butter

553
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:15,960
and I eat it. It's delicious. Oh that's good and why is that gross somehow?

554
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:24,859
Yeah if you have a bag of Doritos on your desk in front of you right now sitting on your desk

555
01:52:24,859 --> 01:52:30,069
you are not allowed to say oh that's gross. If you have if you look down if you're holding a

556
01:52:30,069 --> 01:52:35,430
half empty bag of Doritos in your hand you do not say oh to me eating peanut butter with some peanut

557
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:41,960
oil on it. Let's get out of here with that. If you look down right now and your hand is covered in

558
01:52:41,960 --> 01:53:01,300
fucking taki dust I don't want to hear shit about how I like peanut butter. It's not the same. What

559
01:53:02,979 --> 01:53:16,819
what are you talking about? What about sushi? That's good. You drinking the oil. I'm not

560
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:24,170
I don't tip it up in like no I'm talking he's getting a little bit it's like a little test

561
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:31,050
it's a little tasting like that's it man it's not a big deal it's really not and it's way better

562
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:53,140
than the taki dust that's all over your fingers that one olive oil or butter they're both good

563
01:53:53,140 --> 01:54:04,359
I mean olive oil is better I think but I don't put butter on that much stuff olive oil is better

564
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:23,100
yeah y'all just wait just wait when the when the apocalypse comes and and I'm and I'm the guy that

565
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:30,460
has like the 20 vats of peanut butter in his pantry you can live off that shit I'm gonna live

566
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:35,159
for a long time I'm gonna be sitting there people I'm gonna be trading peanut butter

585
01:59:10,199 --> 01:59:16,760
bullshit ice creams where they make they have a whole box and there's like two in the box

586
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:21,720
or like four in the whole box that's how you can look in there and be like somebody ate three of

587
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:44,229
these and I only had one not the same that one's good by the way I was that person I told you the

588
01:59:44,229 --> 01:59:50,149
story about uh did I tell you guys that the twix ice cream bars or the note was snickers snickers

589
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:58,760
ice cream bars after I talked about that how um my brother used to get really pissed off at me

590
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:10,810
not just with snickers ice cream bars but with other very very valuable treats they would only

591
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:17,100
be like four or six in a box or something I think there was like four and hold on hold that thought

592
02:00:17,100 --> 02:01:45,779
this is like a major fight attack him what are you doing man oh yeah okay so anyways

593
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:53,899
so I used to I love ice cream I love treats I need a little snack I loved it and in the house

594
02:01:53,899 --> 02:01:59,340
there would always just be one box of like twix ice cream bars or snickers ice cream bars or

595
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:05,340
drumsticks whatever it was and I would always lie to my brother because I would I would go down

596
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:11,720
you could I could never eat just one of those I always ate two because they weren't it wasn't

597
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:18,699
enough those snickers ice cream bars were small so I would just be obsessed with it I would eat

598
02:02:18,699 --> 02:02:24,600
the whole thing and it'd be like I'm I'm they I have to have another one so I'd eat two and then

599
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:33,579
like an hour later I heard one and my brother would not have one yet he would go to the box

600
02:02:33,899 --> 02:02:41,189
one in the box he'd be like what are you doing Jeremy Jeremy you how many did you have

601
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:46,949
I'd be like what I had like one it was just lying and then he'd be like I know and he would go look

602
02:02:46,949 --> 02:02:52,149
for wrappers he would go look for wrappers he'd be like oh yeah because I would leave that shit

603
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:56,069
on the desk and stuff or in my room whatever like and he would go be like oh yeah really

604
02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:02,520
I was smart enough though I kept him in my fucking pocket what do you think I'm dumb

605
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:19,289
what do you always get so pissed uh let's see if they would I've said I obviously don't do that

606
02:03:19,289 --> 02:03:28,789
anymore since I was like a teenager like I was I was like a young teenager I don't do that anymore

607
02:03:28,789 --> 02:03:35,640
guys I don't really eat ice cream that much anymore I love ice cream but it's not I don't

608
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:53,100
really have that often it's so good though you do that with peanut butter no one is going to be

609
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:56,779
this thing but that's what I said it's not a peanut butter is not a high value treat

610
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:05,289
Quicks ice cream bars are incredibly high value my brother would not go into the pantry and be

611
02:04:05,289 --> 02:04:10,970
like dude the peanut butter's half gone what the heck are you doing man peanut butter's gone

612
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:20,420
but no way that's not a high value treat that would never happen if peanut butter was half

613
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:31,800
gone one day or just be like whatever I don't care have jam or Nutella you sicko yeah I'm not

614
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:38,680

615
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:58,060

I've never ever had Nutella like at the house or like out of the jar

619
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:39,100
I've never had it I've had it if it was in something else if it was like part of something else I've
