00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,219

All right, let's go

39
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,680
This is custom robo incoming. I don't know anything about this game

40
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,520
At all. Hope you can hear it because I can't

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,509
You hear it? Yeah

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,060
All right, this is a game about customizing a robot you put them and they fight

43
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,099
They battle you battle other people's robots. It's like pokemon except you actually make shit

44
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:43,110
You don't just like steal animals and put them into a fucking ball. It's pokemon, but the person has to actually work

45
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:53,960
And and actually do shit

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,319
No, that's not right. That's not real

47
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,469
All right. This is a new journey. I'm ready. I'm excited for this

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,889
Hello

49
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:14,629
You hear a phone ringing and it could be anyone nobody can do keeper southerland, but him that's another guy that you can't do

50
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,209
Hello

51
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,339
Oh, you're there good

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Dad, is that you?

53
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,100
I can't talk long son. Can you come outside right now?

54
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah, okay

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:38,410
sans sans when he's older and he's talking to his son sons dad

56
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,949
What's wrong dad? Why aren't you at work?

57
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,790
It's your birthday, isn't it? I brought you a present here. Hold out your hand

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,389
Is this where like dad makes you pull his finger or something?

59
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,029
Wow

60
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,029
It's the watch you promised me

61
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,509
But don't you need that for work?

62
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,310
They're very special watch sons

63
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:15,300
There's nothing else like it in the world and I want you to have it. They're serious. You're really giving it to me

64
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,939
Thanks, dad. This is so cool

65
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,399
Cut to the watch is broken because the kid dropped it and stepped on it and smashed it and maybe dad

66
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:30,600
You shouldn't give like an eight-year-old like a 14 million dollar rare artifact watch not a great idea

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:41,399
Like I said, it's very special and I need you to take care of it. No problem. Dad. I'll take good care of it

68
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,199
Good promise me one more thing

69
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,399
Keep it on you always don't ever take it off even in the shower

70
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,540
Even when taking a bath, uh-huh. You got it dad. I'm never ever gonna take it off

71
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,579
Think of me when you wear this watch take good care of it

72
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,420
Even when you're all grown up, I want you to keep it safe. It's not gonna fit anymore

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,839
It's gonna be embedded in his arm. Don't ever take that off and don't ever adjust it either

74
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:24,790
I'll know it's gonna be a big red embedded infected fucking thing on his wrist. Uh-huh watch ringing

75
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,209
Look at the time

76
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:36,439
Dad's gotta go. You'll be a good boy now. He's gone and he's never coming back

77
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,620
Huh, you're leaving but you just got here

78
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,980
I'm sorry son, but I have to uh, there's some work that only your old man can do

79
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,269
I have to go and get cigarettes

80
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,209
Goodbye son. Why are we getting it? I'm gonna get cigarettes meme

81
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,250
Remember think of me when you wear this watch take care of it. Don't forget. All right

82
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,949
Is this even my dad I won't but dad, where are you going?

83
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,589
Far away

84
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,149
I have to go to a place. That's very far away

85
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,949
Prison

86
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,990
I'm going to prison son, and I don't want you to know

87
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:42,500
Dad

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,180
That was insane

89
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,139
Why would you do that in front teaching you kid all this fucked up shit wake up?

90
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:58,579
But you got wax in your ears. I said wake up and get out of bed. What the hell am I in a hospital?

91
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,939
Honestly, just because you don't work doesn't mean you can sleep your day away

92
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,290
Do you even know what time it is? It's past noon

93
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,769
You were supposed to start streaming 31 minutes ago. Don't you have a job interview?

94
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,939
What was that place again stale horse? You need that job if you're gonna pay your rent

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,740
Now get up and get that job

96
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,809
You heard me get out of bed and drag your lazy behind to that stale horse interview

97
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,580
Geez good morning to you too, and it's not steel horse. It's steel hearts

98
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,529
Whatever just get up and get out of bed

99
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,149
You need that job

100
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:53,860
Oh and good luck. What kind of room is this?

101
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:02,309
This is a hospital. I still have the watch on. Well, these are interesting clothes

102
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,120
Holy shit. This is awesome. I don't even I wasn't expecting this to be running

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,360
Half-life, uh to get two open door sounds, right? Whatever someone's to say whatever

104
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:28,940
Wait, did I do it? Can I do anything in here? Can I touch anything? No new part data, please come back. It's kingdom hearts

105
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:37,259
Yeah, this this character exists in the kingdom hearts universe somewhere

106
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,759
Look at you all gussied up and ready to go. Now. Don't you come back here without a job?

107
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,940
I've been worried about you

108
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,100
And not just because of the rent, you know

109
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,269
You worried about me?

110
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,470
Well, we've all been worried not a single word from your father for years and then that letter come

111
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,870
It must have been a terrible shock to find out about his death like that. Just a lettering of will

112
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,309
uh

113
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,309
Did he crash his car?

114
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,149
eight years ago

115
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,759
Just curious

116
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,080
Telling me to become a robo commander. I know it's weird, but I hadn't seen him for so long

117
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,659
In fact, the only thing I really remember of oh my dad

118
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,299
Is the watch he gave me

119
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,230
I don't remember anything else

120
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,230
That's beside the point

121
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,389
I need to worry about the future now

122
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,909
That's certainly true. You've been living off your family savings for years

123
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,029
It's about time. You got a job

124
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:52,360
I'll do my best. In fact, I'll do whatever it takes to become a commander

125
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,169
Isn't neat

126
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:02,389
That's what your father wanted. Isn't it? At least that's what it said in his will

127
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:09,049
You're a good boy, you could go for any job you wanted but you don't want to let your father down

128
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,250
But you could go for any what I mean, you're a good boy. You could go for any job you want

129
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,529
But since when does being a good boy

130
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,149
Represent skills in a field

131
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,919
You go to a job interview

132
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:31,240
Now, what would you say your skills are? Well, i'm a good boy. Holy shit. That's the first one we've heard today. Come on in

133
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,879
We only have bad boys here. They all have tattoos all over the place

134
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,399
They have neck tattoos and they wear leather jackets to work. Oh, thank goodness. We've got a good boy. Finally

135
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:50,309
Yeah, I wonder why did my dad want me to become a commander?

136
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,269
I don't know why it was so important to him, but I'll give it a try at least, huh?

137
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,279
I like to see his last wish fulfilled a commander, huh? Yeah, I can do it

138
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:10,789
Uh, what's a commander do commander's a person who controls a custom robo

139
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,179
No, i'm afraid. I just don't follow that. Could you say it a little less green?

140
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,899
Anyway, don't think of me as a landlady. Think of me as a friend

141
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,789
If you need any advice just ask

142
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:33,899
Thanks. Well, then you go get that job and become a commander at stale horse. I'll do my best

143
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Bye

144
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,669
What just happened to the game?

145
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,490
Nobody move nobody move

146
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:10,009
Nobody move. All right, is this the stale horse?

147
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,779
One day i'm gonna join the police squad and use my robo to fight crime

148
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,330
What are they doing?

149
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,779
I'm gonna keep practicing with my custom robo until i'm a big and strong bounty hunter

150
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:27,029
these kids in timeout

151
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:29,669
This looks like

152
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,269
future timeout

153
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,269
I don't get what are the what are they doing?

154
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,490
My wife told me the kids would need a robo. They were going to get anywhere in this world, but

155
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,649
Those things are expensive. I have my needs too, you know

156
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,419
Hi there neighbor job hunting again. It must be rough out there. Good luck

157
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,299
It's not burning. All right, we have to go to the stale horse. This is like pokemon

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,720
Wait just a second. I said you could treat me like a friend. That doesn't mean you can go poking around in my office

159
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Right left right left right left

160
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,120
Where is this place?

161
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:41,690
Whoa. Oh, it's doing it automatically. Okay, that's good. Oh, here comes the first tutorial battle

162
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,679
What do I talk to first? All right, let's talk to you

163
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,429
All right, what do you want? All right, you're here for the interview

164
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,940
You see that scary looking guy over there. He's the guy you want to talk to he's the boss

165
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,940
Okay

166
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,259
I how do you i mean, what's this one? That's weird

167
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:13,460
It sounds like a trash compactor that's on a person talking

168
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,330
So you're here for the interview, right? Let's get this over with

169
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
You ever work a bounty hunter before?

170
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,639
Of course

171
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,639
No, it's my first time

172
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,480
I think I have no it's my first time of course. No, it's my first time

173
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,279
I think I have no it's my first time

174
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,289
And don't be cocky

175
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,450
Look forget it moving on next question. You got a robo

176
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:54,629
I lost it. I can't afford I lost it. I can't afford one. You got a spare. I can't I lost it

177
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,629
I can't afford you got a spare

178
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,669
That was perfect. I don't have to do this one

179
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,669
That's just how the guy laughs. That's okay

180
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:17,129
You're funny

181
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,649
Anyway, i'm sorry, but I need an experienced guy with his own robo

182
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,990
I just can't afford to hire an amateur

183
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,870
My watch is going to turn out to be a robot, right?

184
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,429
What are you talking about? We can't afford to hire anyone who's not an amateur

185
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,909
Besides i'm being the new guy. I'm sick of being the new guy. We need someone I can push around

186
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,470
I'm sick of dealing with the chief on my own. What'd I tell you about these bad boys?

187
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Hey, just a quick question

188
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,139
You wouldn't happen to be a good boy, would you?

189
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,279
You got something to say

190
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,320
Listen, even if we did hire you we don't have a robo or a spare

191
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,360
Oh, you'll need to get on get one

192
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,579
Make a good impression

193
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,259
What should I say?

194
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:16,630
I'm a good cook

195
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,349
Oh great. I'll call you when we're going after the sinister spatula and his bake sale bandits

196
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,269
None of this really matters though

197
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,190
The simple fact is we don't have the money to buy you a robo

198
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
And so that's why I can't hire you

199
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,980
Does he have a booger hanging out of his nose?

200
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,339
Oh, but but but

201
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,299
We really need some fresh blood around here chief

202
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
We've got too much work and not enough people

203
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,930
Can't we get an old junker robo for him to use?

204
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,369
You don't pay the bills around here

205
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:58,170
Sorry pal. You look nice enough, but you might as well forget it

206
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,130
Whoa, we've got a call. Maybe it's a job

207
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,329
Yeah

208
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:10,819

Got work to do harry standard burglary and the police squad's fighting theme

217
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,220
Police squad's fighting them now

218
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,460
We need more we need a bit of theme music. Hey, you said you're a cook. Are you awesome a musician?

219
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,390

220
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,349
By the way, who just called?

221
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,019

00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:10,019
Shut your yap and get going head out to the research lab

223
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,819
Request comes from the lab director

224
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,039

Take the kid with you

228
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:28,650
Once he sees what a real fight looks like he'll tuck his tail between his legs and run home

229
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,240
Wow, oh man. All right. Come on. Let's I just don't get in the way

230
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:46,150
Somebody say reddit walk

231
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,230
I thought was linda on the phone. She's the director of the robo research lab

232
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,519
Something going down at the lab. It's really gorgeous smart and compassionate

233
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Really? She's the perfect match for me

234
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,970
Okay

235
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,329
I think of her like an older sister sorta. I mean not really but oh now that that's weird now

236
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,730
That got weird

237
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:20,970
That got weird really weird. In fact like weird where that just made me uncomfortable being in the same seat

238
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,059
As you

239
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,369
But you were not sitting together

240
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,009
Don't try anything funny with her. You got it

241
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,869
Yeah, I got it

242
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,869
I make no promises

243
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,869
What do you mean funny

244
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:42,500
You know like hiding behind a wall and then jumping out and scaring her stuff like that

245
00:20:47,609 --> 00:21:01,380
Oh that this is that they're in like thought battle. This is a fucking banger. It's those bottom feeders

246
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,420
Don't be mean

247
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
We're bounty hunters

248
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:12,140
Whatever you all pray off the lowest of the low you bounty hunters are all bottom feeders

249
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:18,619
Don't give me any static. We're here on an assignment. Oh, yeah, nobody here asked you for your help

250
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,539
I did

251
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:26,259
Uh for a bunch of grill marks on her legs

252
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,930
Well, what we got this covered

253
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:33,779
Looking good as always linda

254
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,619
Thanks harry

255
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,859
I need you to take care of those crooks right away

256
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:47,079
They're after ray01 our newest robo. It's still in development and it was top secret

257
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,599
Top secret. Oh, that's so cool

258
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,009
Yes, but there's no telling what could happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands

259
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,490
We can't let them take it with your skills you should be able to take care of them easily

260
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:07,460
But that's what we're doing. They're stealing our newest robo. One can't be too careful

261
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,680
That's right. You heard her. You can't be too careful and that's where we come in

262
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,279
I can't imagine if my window was open and like my neighbor was listening to this

263
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,690
I'm realizing this now

264
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,099
Hearing this out of context this person

265
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,220
You know what this you know what? I would be happy with it completely. You know why i'm writing a screenplay

266
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm like doing a screenplay thing

267
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,660
Holy shit that guy's up there acting. Oh, he's he's right. He's writing a screenplay. That's definitely what that is

268
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,740
What else could the fuck that be?

269
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,539
There's nothing else that makes sense with that that situation at all. That's a pretty cool screenplay that guy's doing

270
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,079
We're gonna get involved but you know, you can't always rely on the police squad. Some jobs are just too important

271
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,779
Okay, then

272
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,779
You wait here try not to get in the way

00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:06,180

00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:16,740
Good luck harry burglar why are the burglars wear those on their faces?

275
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,740
What do you want? You don't look like one of those police squad guns

276
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,019
My name's harry and i'm a bounty hunter

277
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:28,970

286
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,019
wait a minute steel hearts

287
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,900
Oh, you mean those bottom feeders?

288
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:10,980
We're not bottom feeders. We're bounty hunters

289
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,549
I'm counting on you harry

290
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:22,549
Please hurry up with the tutorial and protect ray one and teach him how to press a already for god's sake

291
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,250
Uh, we're trying our hardest, you know

292
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,700
Um, excuse me

293
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:35,369
What is it?

294
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,890
What are those people doing?

295
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,210
What are they doing? They're they're fighting of course

296
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,319
Fighting you expect me to believe they're fighting

297
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,480
Uh, yes

298
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,559
But they're not doing anything

299
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,799
They're just staring at each other

300
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,269
No, no, no, no, they're using their custom robos to fight. Can't you tell?

301
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,470
Huh?

302
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,029
Well, I don't see any custom robo anywhere

303
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,059
That's because they're fighting inside the holo. Museum

304
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,019
a holo zam of course

305
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,269
holo zam

306
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,779
It is a thought battle. Yes. A holo zam is a fighting arena created in a digital environment

307
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:24,970
The custom robos fight within that virtual battlefield

308
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,619
Hmm. I think I get it. Please stop spinning it though

309
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,299
Oh, but yes

310
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,869
Where's rayo one?

311
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,750
I haven't seen any robos at all since we got here

312
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:45,430
Well, the custom robo remains in cube form until it is released into the holo zam to

313
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,730
Wait, you're teasing me, aren't you?

314
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,369
Surely, you know all of this already

315
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,349
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've never really seen though

316
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:59,670
You do work with harry. Don't you aren't you one of the steel hearts bounty hunters?

317
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,309
uh

318
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,990
Steam coming out of my I mean, yeah, i'm with the steel hearts. I think

319
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,480
Out of my ears

320
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,519
Well, then get to work go fight some burglars. What are you what are we paying you for?

321
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,599
Take a look harry and the police are having a tough time. You should be helping them

322
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,759
Uh, why don't I just go punch one of these guys in the stomach?

323
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,670
What are you talking about?

324
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,589
I mean aren't these burglars right now completely engrossed in their digital world

325
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,630
What if I just went and stabbed them all in the back one by one?

326
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,059
No, no, no, that's uh

327
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
I mean you could try I don't think it'll work

328
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,750
Yeah, yeah, I guess i'll help

329
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,849
All right, is there one that's not fighting

330
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
This guy here is pretty strong

331
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,819
Just pick one of these up and overhead hit him in the head with it. What's I don't understand the problem

332
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,130
Harry i'm here to help you

333
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,609
What did you?

334
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:17,339
Ah

335
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:24,710
Oh, wait, there's the cube. Oh you idiot. Don't talk to me when i'm fighting. I lost the fight because of you

336
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,130
Yeah, that's what you get for not paying attention

337
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:33,930
Oh, I think I hurt myself. Oh shoot. They're gonna swipe that new robo

338
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,369
harry, uh

339
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,250
Why don't we just shoot him? Let me help

340
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,769
But you don't even have a robo

341
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:48,089
Oh, yeah, that's right. Should I punch him in the face? I could punch him right now in his face

342
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,670
Let me borrow your robo. I'll use it to fight

343
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,089
It won't work. I've already done my eye scan registration. I'm the only one who could use it

344
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,490
Eye scan registration. What the heck? I got no time to explain

345
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,599
Whoa, can I go now?

346
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,119
I mean if you two were just gonna fight amongst yourselves, you really don't meet me here. Do you?

347
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,440
And even the crooks are making fun of us. If only you had a robo and a scrumptious cake

348
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,990
robo

349
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,990
Hmm. I guess I take this one

350
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,650
What's this box?

351
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,849
Huh?

352
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,279
There's a button on the back

353
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,519
Better press it. I better forget it

354
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,259
I'm gonna let me check. Maybe all right. Let me show you a cool trick. I'm gonna smash this off my head

355
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:46,460
It's gonna crumple up like a can but i'm gonna do the bar thing where i'm trying to describe

356
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,740
The thing I want to describe to you guys, but it's hard to do it right now

357
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,910
Well, it's starting to buzz

358
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,789
Well there did you just do an eye scan registration?

359
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,259
You still haven't told me what that even is

360
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:09,109
Eye scan registration is when you look directly into the robo's sensor while pressing that button

361
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,470
Okay

362
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,470
But there's no time to explain that

363
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,940
The point is you're now the only one who can control that robo

364
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:20,710
Hurry and die

365
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:24,299
This is a robo

366
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,259
Shut up and do as I say beat that burglar

367
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:38,329
Think about a kid you should think about this kid

368
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,089
You sure you want to go up against me even though you never used to cut the robo for your entire life

369
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,529
This wise guy thinks he's too tough just because he hasn't got lucky against me

370
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:49,450
Captain he's definitely not going to be lucky against you

371
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,329
And make sure to be in the mess hall for dinner

372
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,019
Now listen your robo shoot from the robo cannon on the left side

373
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:07,480
Nobody knows what that is

374
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,440
I'm not even gonna say what it is. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of new people here

375
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,319
Oh, whatever you'll figure it out

376
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,309
All right, your robo will shoot out from the robo cannon on the left side

377
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:28,140
Robo cannon this machine that shoots out the robo cube

378
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,410
The robo cube transforms once it's been fired. All right, so I shoot it out of a cannon and it turns into a robot

379
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:41,529
Custom robo 101. What is this link?

380
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:47,349
All right. This is like this is whatever i'll show it

381
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:51,849
This is better. I gotta make sure this is not the chuck-e-cheese kiss image

382
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,190
Okay, because i've all right. It's not

383
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:16,470
What the fuck?

384
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,990
There you go. I got it for you

385
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:26,099
All right, when the robo cube counts down to zero it completes its transformation. Do I actually run around the robo?

386
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Press the b button to fire your gun

387
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,980
Use your gun to blam blam blam your enemy's energy down to zero and you win use the control stick to zoom zoom

388
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,019
Zoom around and use the b button to fire

389
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,539
All right, i'm just gonna do it

390
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,210
Fights made him weak you'll do just

391
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,329
Boom zoom zoom bang bang

392
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,230
Buzzwords

393
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,559
Enemy. Oh shit

394
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,640
All right

395
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:08,150
That's that's the enemy

396
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:14,279
Paints parts and model types. All right. Hold on customized robo. What do I have?

397
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,509
Oh, he's so cool looking. This is ray01

398
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,549

399
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:27,369
Okay, come with basic capabilities fires three rounds at a time aerial and ground shots are the same medium range

400
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,150

401
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Oh shit, okay

402
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,799
There's 13 pages of guns

403
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,599
I'm sorry that was that that just came up

404
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,109
All right, let's go

405
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:51,640
It's an american game

406
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
What do you mean american game?

407
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,630
All right, ready three wait with the what?

408
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,779
You you have to throw them out like dice

409
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:05,269
How do I get out of the cube? How do I get out of the cube?

410
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:15,829
Holy shit, this is actually pretty cool

411
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:24,759
Reborning zoom zoom zoom around

412
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,650
I don't have a zoom zoom zoom. Oh, he's gonna beat me

413
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,380
Do I have any other buttons or weapons?

414
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:40,700
Wait, he's he's

415
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,380
Oh wait, there's a double jump

416
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,029
Wait a minute. All right, I get it. Oh

417
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,910
That's missile. He hit himself his own missile

418
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,140
Use the terrain to my advantage

419
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:03,940
mashing buttons

420
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Oh, that was a dash move. That was like falco

421
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,960
All right. That was cool. That was pretty fun. That was just the basic tutorial

422
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
That just he landed on his neck

423
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,380
Good work. Oh one of the police guys just blew it go over there and clean up his mess

424
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,539
Yes

425
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,960
I like the soundtrack

426
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,440
Oh, come on. I knocked that loser out. Don't deserve a break

427
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,619
All right. Listen up that guy ought to be worn out from his fight, too

428
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,699
If you listen to my advice, you should be able to beat him

429
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,500
Use the r button to fire bombs and use the l button to launch an attack pod

430
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,110
Okay

431
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,070
Firing your pod doesn't stop you from being able to move freely

432
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,449
Run at your opponent and keep on pressing the l button use the r button to drop the bombs and use the l button to blast

433
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:04,889
the pod

434
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,170
Sticky bombs

435
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:15,670
One more thing if you get caught in your own pod blast you're gonna take damage drop the bomb blast the pod

436
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:29,769
Enemy we just look at it pod bomb

437
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,889
Just easy enough. Just throw just just drop bombs. All right. I'm still confused about this part

438
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,949
Have to tap a

439
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:59,460
Why does he have an advantage?

440
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,199
Wait, oh

441
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,769
Well, they're kind of like homing missiles in a way

442
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:22,280
Why would you come over here? My fucking specialty is mid-range dude

443
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:33,659
Shoot him in the air too, right?

444
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:49,610
Fuck him down and then do it this game's cool than I thought it was gonna be

445
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,210
Uh-huh

446
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,190
Okay class

447
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,190
Can we can I get an apology now?

448
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,980
No

449
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,179
Why?

450
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:09,860
That's just kind of hard hit

451
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:20,260
Right there boom

452
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:30,179
What this game's worse than evolva. What are you talking about? No. No, it is not

453
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,139
It is not even close by the way that game wasn't even bad

454
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,019
That game was actually kind of fun. You guys just wouldn't give it a chance

455
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,590
Not bad for an amateur

456
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,320
This is way better. I mean this game is like a classic video game

457
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,940
We lost another cop take the next guy

458
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,670
Up up the police squad ain't nothing still I break a sweat

459
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,889
He looks pretty tired. If you listen to my advice you should be able to win

460
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:10,010
Try using the a button or jump you can do I know i'm going to neelix again. I know but it's it's fits for me

461
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,449
I don't know why

462
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:14,329
No, it doesn't fit this character at all though. I just it's what i'm doing

463
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,769
You can do an air dash twice I learned that already

464
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:21,289
You can charge with the x button. Yeah

465
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,480
Nice. All right. I get it

466
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Rubble can't move when it's down

467
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,599
Use the a button to jump and the x button to charge crash

468
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,849
Got it. Got it

469
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,610
You only do a charge when you're on the ground. It won't work if you're in the air jump and crash

470
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,920
Volva 2 waiting room that game doesn't exist

471
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,610
happen

472
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:55,690
And these people

473
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:01,829
Make it I can't make a game. All right, get out

474
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:10,730
I'm just gonna overwhelm this guy. All right. He has a much longer countdown than me doesn't he? No, he doesn't

475
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,909
Yeah. Yeah. Yo, yo, yo

476
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,929
Yo

477
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,289
Why does that happen?

478
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:31,610
Look at that juggle

479
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,829
Look at that around the corner. That's a mario 64 battle team shit

480
00:39:36,710 --> 00:40:03,159
How would you get that close?

481
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,159
Hey, yo, this game's fun

482
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,690
I really like this

483
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,809
And this is just this is the tutorial got a lot more to see

With 13 pages of guns, you now have access to the twin flank pod f

485
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:24,500
Go visit a parts generator

486
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
You want rayo one and smash?

487
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:37,300
Um, not not really no. Well, I think you still need some work, but well done

488
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:46,889
He was an assist. Yeah. I mean, I I don't know him enough. I have to get to know this character and see if I like it

489
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:54,030
Before you take them on go over to the parts generator and get yourself some new parts parts generator

490
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:58,030
I'll explain later just stand in front of him press a you'll get a new part

Thanks. You could have said that in one panel. We've got a twin flank pod f

495
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,199
Nice. Okay. So what does that mean?

496
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,780
What happened here? I turned my back on one second and all my men get wiped out. I'm worn out, but we need that robo

497
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:31,550
Last guy's exhausted. This should be as easy as a scrumptious cake still you'd better listen to my advice

498
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:36,510
Use the control stick to change the direction of the robo cube when it launches

499
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,239
When the cube hits the ground the number shows how long it needs to charge for the transformation

500
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,000
To speed up the charge tap the controller buttons rapidly. Okay

501
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:53,389
If you transform before your opponent you get to attack first

502
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,030
So I didn't know that use the control stick to aim the robo cannon where you want to shoot and then tap the buttons. Got it

503
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,829
Got it

504
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,829
smash mash mash mash

505
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:12,380
What why are you linking with this? What is it? Why the I don't get this?

506
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,079
This is shitty picture of me too like right about to start laughing with like eyes. I hate that photo

507
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,909
turn

508
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:35,389
Tappity zoom zoom jumpity jump bang bang boom boom clam crash

509
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,219
To the porn ads love it. Can we talk about that for a second?

510
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,349
I was in a second porn ad. Is that what you get?

511
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:48,909
Because I know there was one before

512
00:42:51,440 --> 00:43:00,079
Is this number two? Yes. Okay for those of you that have no idea and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna link it

513
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,639
I don't want to give any attention to it. It's like why would I do that?

514
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,079
uh

515
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
Somebody used for some reason

516
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,920
people use this

517
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,400
Me laughing and talking like six years ago or five years ago, whatever this was

518
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,250
And they put it on top of like it's me interacting with a girl online

519
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:22,780
It's uh, it's like an interact with a girl fake. I didn't do it. Like they just use it

520
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:26,809
I I have I don't even I have no idea

521
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Yes, it's real and this has happened twice

522
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:42,000
This is not a one-time occurrence

523
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,469
It's ridiculous

524
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,789
Somebody all right. Somebody said are you soon?

525
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,130
uh, okay, hi

526
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,929
Okay, let me let's go over the amount of effort that it would take for me to get into a legal battle with a porn ad

527
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:06,969
Well, i'm not gonna what should I lawyer up? All right, i'm gonna lawyer up. Let's do I don't what do you want me to do?

528
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,900
I don't even know where this company is bay. I don't know who this I don't know anything about these people

529
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,519
It's not worth it for me to do that

530
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,760
I'm just waiting for the day that I get hit up by somebody that I like

531
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,800
Haven't talked to in probably five ten years or something like that

532
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,110
Hey, dude, are you like doing porn now?

533
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,239
What's this? What's this ad? Are you what's going on here? Did you see this and i'm like, yeah

534
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,039
I should say yeah

535
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah

536
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,119
Is that all right with you?

537
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,690

00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,809
Um, yeah, I I just was care. That's you. Yeah, it's me

00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:02,250
Yeah, four. Cool. How are they? They're good. All right. See you again in 10 years when you ask me another question

542
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,949
Hi

543
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:15,340
But I have to customize plus if it's not based in the u.s. But yeah, it's just

544
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,900
And I look i'll be honest with you

545
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:28,280
It doesn't that doesn't I don't care. I really just don't care. All right, where's that new thing basic?

546
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,599
standard

547
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:44,119
Where is it? Is it already attached? What was it called? It's a pod. Oh, it's the pod

548
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
One flank pod. Oh wait mash

549
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,119
I wasn't mashing. I wasn't mashing. It's okay

550
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:06,199
Yes, it was but no, I don't care really. I don't

551
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,969
Look, okay. Let's let's go over this if it was like

552
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,269
something

553
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:20,199
Egregiously awful that I was in like you guys all know I have the green screen shit and the green screen shit is literally

554
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,280
I don't care what anyone does with it

555
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,000
Except

556
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,440
you know

557
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,920
There's some things that I would not be comfortable with my image being put up, right?

558
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:35,719
It's very few things

559
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,280
But let's be honest. I think you all know what they could be

560
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:51,880
That's how you juggle

561
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,199
Wait, I can aim this

562
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:02,079
Holy shit, this changes everything

563
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,030
It's got like little mice

564
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:24,969
What about a penis enlargement pill advertisement? No, I don't care. You have access to the three-way gun

565
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,309
Omega low that's actually funny. Okay. Yeah, I I don't

566
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,300
there's a line right and

567
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:47,659
The line when you if you cross the line, you know, you're crossing the line

568
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,840
It's not hard to determine that I don't think so

569
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:04,269
There's a very clear line. I think of what like all right, don't fucking do that. Wait, who's this?

570
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:08,989
God, when did you get here?

571
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:12,539
Why did you hit your head

572
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,340
Listen, the reason you got beaten is because you're not properly trained

573
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,650
I've said it before and i'll say it again

574
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,650
You need to get out of the mercenary business

575
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,360
Start studying get yourself a class a license and join the police squad

576
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,119
Oh, don't start on that again. I told you I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those tacky uniforms

577
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:40,199
Look, i'll pay all your exam fees. It won't cost you a dime. What do you say?

578
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,780
It's not about the money. I just don't like studying

579
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:53,469
Captain mira, we've sent the criminals over to hq. We ought to head back to their ourselves

580
00:48:54,030 --> 00:49:04,199
I can't believe we needed help from those bounty hunters. I'll make sure that all police squad members presented this travesty

581
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,179
We'll hit the training room hard

582
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:09,289
After mira

583
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:11,289
We should get back to hq

584
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:20,480
I'll be waiting at the front gate. See you harry. I'll be working late. So don't wait up for me

585
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,500
Get some sleep

586
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,820
Keep yourself warm when you go to bed

587
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:28,489
You don't want to catch cold

588
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:37,449
stop

589
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:41,210
Stop, stop. No, stop. You're ruining her for me. Stop, please

590
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,519
That's not what it's ended up here in my head. That's not what she sounds like. Stop doing that

591
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,650
You always treat me like i'm a kid

592
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,409
Is that your brother? Is that your older sister? Is that your girlfriend?

593
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:04,360
Is that your older sister?

594
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,239
Yeah, jeez. She's always acting so macho. It really freaks me out. There are nothing's in your business

595
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:18,460
Harry are you hurt?

596
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,530
Linda yeah, i'm okay. I never felt better

597
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,480
By the way harry this person's weird. I would not want to talk to this person. It'd be weird

598
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:34,460
Look, i'm i'm i don't do this in in real conversations with people

599
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:41,400
When i'm like one-on-one, i'm not like hello. Yes kim. We're gonna go get a nice delicious steak

600
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,480
I don't i don't i don't do that

601
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,039
Um, and I do sometimes I do sometimes all right a few times i've done that

602
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,710
I yell up the stairs and i'm like honey

603
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:56,670
Um, can you come down here for a few minutes? I do this all the time. Fuck. I do this all the time

604
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:02,119
But not that often not every sentence maybe like once every few days

605
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,099
Well, he's got what it takes to be a great commander someday still. He's got a long way to go

606
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:17,039
Oh, I totally agree linda. Oh, you're so observant like that. It's incredible. Yeah

607
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,159
It's not like he got the best robot that exists ray. Oh one. It's like the most strong robot

608
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,239
You gave him like a uh, yeah

609
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:29,760
I I have a regular default hearthstone deck and he has every legendary in the game. That's not no, it's fair

610
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,280
great commander sheesh

611
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:44,199
Harry i've got an idea. How about letting him use our new robot ray? Oh one

612
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:48,539
He adapted it pretty quickly

613
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,880
And i'd like to gather some data on his usage and control. Can we can we talk about hearthstone for one second?

614
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
I know everyone's gonna be like

615
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,460
I played it recently

616
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,780
And holy shit how much that game has changed

617
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,449
I was doing like the solo adventure stuff and I was like, oh, this is kind of fun

618
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:07,449
I remember when they they did this stuff

619
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,480
the amount of like

620
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,880
Throw up eight minions on the board wipe eight minions throw up eight minions on the board add plus four plus four to all minions

621
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,750
Wipe all minions eight minions on the board. When did that start happening?

622
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,719
No one asked

623
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:31,289
Yeah, but I I decided I wanted to talk about it. It was three years ago

624
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:35,369
What happened? Oh, that's probably the last time I really tried

625
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,130
You have no free will. Oh, yeah

626
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,429
Are you sure?

627
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:51,070
Are you sure it's not you that doesn't have and there he goes purged

628
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,610
Who has the power here?

629
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,130
MonkaS

630
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,489
Wait, this guy he's not really he's not with us. He came by today looking for work

631
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:08,599
The chief doesn't want to hire him though

632
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,719
Oh really i'll recommend that earnest hire him myself then

633
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,800
I can't wait to see his face so we can go ahead and take this ray-01

634
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,000
Sure, go ahead. Of course. He's already registered

635
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,000
So he can only use the one that he's the only one they can use it time to read

636
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,929
Yeah, I know dang if only I had made eye contact with it first. Wait, what?

637
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,960
That's weird

638
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,760
It's an eye scan. So what it it just it attaches to anyone that it looks at its eyes first

639
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:48,159
So what if a baby looks at it first?

640
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:51,610
Like an infant just happens to match eyes

641
00:53:52,170 --> 00:54:00,239
Is that is that it we have to wait till that kid gets old enough to like think?

642
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,710
We just put it in the shelf good link good link omega lull good link

643
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:13,949
Of course, you always say that it's always good link omega lull and then I click it and my nose is stretched by 20

644
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,400
What is it? Did you did you photo? Who is this?

645
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:38,940
What is this? No, i'm okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm playing the game

646
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:44,619
I'm not showing i'm not showing anymore like chuckie cheese and I i'm not doing that anymore. We're done with that

647
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,980
Oh another great question. I completely forgot to ask

648
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,719
Oh, uh, nothing. Come on. Tell your name

649
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,340
Oh, what's my name?

650
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
Well, it's um

651
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,429
What is it not jacks

652
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,960
paul

653
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,960
Oh, my name is paul in all capitals

654
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:28,880
It's important. Otherwise this lowercase is not my name paul. Oh one. It's weird that

655
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,559
Oh, I should make

656
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,760
I should make a cheeto

657
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:59,659
Oh

658
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:10,920
Dale, huh? I'm lynda. Nice to meet you. Don't worry dale. I'll talk to the chief. Oh fuck. It's lowercase d. Whatever

659
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,800
Ain't that great dale and it sums

660
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,800
Oh

661
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
right

662
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,329
By the way lynda, do you want to grab some lunch?

663
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,880
Oh, i'm sorry. I've just got too much work to do the whole lab's a mess. Thanks to those burglars

664
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,119
Besides your work here is done. Don't you have to get back to the steel hearts office?

665
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,389
I'll give earnest a call and ask him about dale later. You know what I mean?

666
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,179
See you later harry

667
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:52,969
Load the saves. No, I can't load a save state. I don't have a save state. Don't tell me that exists by the way

668
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:02,139
She knows i'm a busy guy. She's got a lot of class that linda is awesome

669
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:06,590
Poor women or something

670
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:11,659
I almost forgot dale. I was going to tell you about the parts generator

671
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:15,630
Me that machine i've got one in my apartment

672
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,780
What

673
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,719
What's a parts generator doing in your apartment?

674
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,119
You don't have a custom robo. You don't even know what if well they you don't know what they are

675
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,449
It belonged to my dad. I never knew what it was supposed to do. It just kind of sits there

676
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,190
Yeah, well, I guess i'll just have to skip that accidentally

677
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:42,880
Anyways, I was about to explain about the parts generator registers new part data into your robo cube when you buy a robo

678
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
It only comes with the standard parts

679
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:53,559
You won't have access to a lot of parts if you don't collect enough battle experience when a robo gathers battle experience

680
00:57:53,719 --> 00:58:00,619
The internal computer records the battle information when the parts generator automatically reads the record and gives you the new part

681
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:08,250
Any new parts you get you can use them in the next battle. Whatever parts you want to use

682
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:16,199
Is up to you. You can customize as much as you'd like. That's it for the hard stuff

683
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,940
It's best to check the parts generator after every battle your opponent

684
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:25,719
Sorry your opponent's not gonna wait for you while you make a quick run to the parts generator

685
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:34,030
Obviously, you can't slip out during a battle. That's why it's best to check with the parts generator after every battle

686
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,800
Even if you forget to check after a battle, you can still get the part afterwards

687
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:43,019
However, if it's just waiting for you to pick it up, why not go get it as soon as possible?

688
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:47,820
The more parts the more you can customize your robo. It gives you I look I know how to I'd get it

689
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:54,320
That was last thing was important. It was just a hundred words of nonsense and then one important line

690
00:58:55,610 --> 00:59:00,800
Also open the customize screen before a battle if you press the r button in that menu

691
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,320
You can practice with your new part cool. You want to get out of practice mode press start and then retire

692
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:11,719
Oh like that guy germa985 in about four years

693
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,369
Well, if you don't understand press start while you're walking around let's get back to the office. All right, let's go

694
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:40,639
Hey dale before we go. Why don't you ask these lab guys for some info? They're robo researchers

695
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:42,639
They'll probably have plenty of stuff they can teach you

696
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:52,010
Give me a holler when you want to leave you're done already

697
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,659
I don't want to hurry back. We get back too quickly and earnest will just give us more work to do chill out

698
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,360
What I told you I was ready to leave. Okay, here we go

699
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:08,110
I need to clean this place. There are parts all over and I've got no clue where to start

700
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:13,019
Custom robots are composed of five parts a body a gun a bomb a pod and a leg unit

701
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,960
Commanders have the freedom to customize any of these five parts in any way they want

702
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,110
The custom part comes from planning a robo design based on battle situation. Thanks

703
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
Those criminals nearly got away with ray01

704
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,820
Robos ray

705
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,699
They're in the hollow museum. Wow, go look in the museum one day go look in the museum. Isn't that cool?

706
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:47,710
I talked to all the people

707
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:57,050
Wait, so you're the one who's taking ray01 from us and you already did an eye scan whoever makes eye contact with a robo

708
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,769
First is its registered commander the only one it obeys

709
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,730
That's what eye scan registration is all about

710
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,559
Thanks for helping us. We're good at science, but not at fighting

711
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,760
By the way, did you know that people who are trained to pilot robots are called commanders?

712
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,840
You're not even doing any work. What's what's your pro? What's what? Tell me

713
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:25,400
Most commanders become better at fighting by mastering each of the robo's abilities

714
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,719
By fighting robots customize their programming and develop ability to operate on new parts

715
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,719
That's why robots don't come pre-installed with all the parts

716
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:38,679
Custom robo needs battle experience in order to alter its code and learn new parts

717
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,559
Parts generators read your robo's battle log and install any new parts in your robot. Excuse me for a minute

718
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,960
Install any parts your robo is able to use

719
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,280
That's why you should check the nearest parts generator. Yes, check it all the time

720
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:02,059
Yeah, you want to know about the lab? There's a government funded robo research and development lab. You've already met linda, right?

721
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:04,139
She's the director of our lab. She's the director cool

722
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,130
I feel like if all these guys just ran as fast as they could into each other

723
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:15,050
Fucking full sprint smushed and smashed into each other. They could just be one guy and he could read me all that

724
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:23,500
I mean, hey, you're gonna have two maybe but you're done already. I am done

725
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:28,219
Oh, you got a three-way gun

726
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:32,619
Did I miss somebody?

727
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:48,119
It's a secret go on without me

728
01:02:49,079 --> 01:03:02,590
That's it back. No, don't take us off course. Don't take us off course, man

729
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:09,369
I'm gonna um

730
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,010
I'm gonna abbreviate everything that's said from the next few minutes

731
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:16,400
guys talented chief

732
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,559
I don't know what happened out there, but linda called i'm supposed to hire him

733
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,360
Hey, you got a cool robo

734
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,639
All right, you're hired

735
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,639
We don't pay very well. Oh man

736
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:40,010
You got the job go home. I'm going home. Thanks tired. Yeah, see you later. Good

737
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:49,559
Do net the netflix dub

738
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,889
Wake up, sweetie

739
01:03:54,889 --> 01:04:00,329
You don't want this to be a complete and total voice acting stream where you just read dialogue and everyone just goes

740
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:20,360
Yes. Oh wake up and go to work already. What the fuck are his pajamas?

741
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,949
What was wrong with them?

742
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:27,550
Time for you to wake up. Don't you start work today? Good luck with that

743
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,429
I'll do my best

744
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:35,789
Now i'm a little confused about all of this. What does a bounty hunter do? Is that like a mercenary?

745
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:40,539
It's hard to explain basically we hunt down criminals with their crimes and robos

746
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:43,099
But isn't that what the police squad does?

747
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,920
We take requests that the police squad considers too small to bother with

748
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,840
Sounds almost like those private eyes from the stories. Are you like a detective or something?

749
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:58,139
Well, I guess all that really matters is you're a commander just like your father

750
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,199
so hard work

751
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,349
Uh-huh. Bye

752
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:05,500
Oh

753
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:18,349
Look at me. It's all the same voice

754
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,110
Yeah

755
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,110
Catching on they're catching on. What do I do?

756
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,510
Go check in with earnest. He doesn't act like it, but he is the boss around here

757
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:36,590
Oh, you're here. We don't have the manpower to spend long training you we need to get you up to speed quickly

758
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Say earnest, where's uh marcia?

759
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,800
I mean the new guy gets here right on time and she's nowhere to be seen. What's up with that?

760
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:49,800
Marcia is on duty right now. She's not a slacker like you harry

761
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,760
Huh on duty this early

762
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,230
I called you this morning, but you didn't answer

763
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,039
Really? That's odd. He ought to know I never answered my cell phone before I knew well, that's why I said marcia

764
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,130
Let me go help her i'll go

765
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,400
Thanks for the offer, but there's no need marcia. It'll be fine on her own

766
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,119
Marcia is a skilled commander not quite as skilled as me, of course

767
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:20,920
I heard you blew it pretty bad yesterday. Got yourself hurt in process

768
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,039
That was dale's fault. He snuck up behind me and

769
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:31,280
Anyway, uh like I was saying before you have to be ready for action at a moment's notice

770
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:34,730
Harry, I want you to take dale to the gym

771
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:39,050
Have him do some warm-ups

772
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:48,000
A little training, huh? Gotcha. Let's go down and keep your cell phone on. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you

773
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:54,010
You have to go to the gym together

774
01:06:54,010 --> 01:07:01,949
That wasn't mr. Satan. This is mr. Satan and that's how you do mr. Satan. That was not even close

775
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:10,000
I got more than four voices. Come on. I got at least eight. This is the training gym

776
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,510
Ernest got us a group membership here so we can train whenever we want. Okay, let's do a round you versus me

777
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,500
two max

778
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,579
This table here is called a holozam deck

779
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:33,099
It's a machine that projects all holos and some commanders like me can create their own holos and some can't just the way it is

780
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,480
Commanders who can't just use a holozam that's built. I thought that's bullshit

781
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,760
Commanders who can't just use a holozam. Oh, that's bullshit

782
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:49,019
But they use holozam decks like these to make one for them. Okay, before we start i've got some pointers for you

783
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:53,579
Probably notice this but you can change the direction the pod fires in. Mm-hmm. Yes

784
01:07:54,809 --> 01:08:00,170
If you don't tilt the control stick, it'll automatically fire in the direction of your opponent. Yes. Got it. Yes

785
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:22,810
Okay

786
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,890
I know you messed with the mouth

787
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:28,649
But the eyes those are like my real eyes and it really does look like my eyes are made out of clay

788
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,800
Like that's somebody's art project

789
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,750
jeff the killer

790
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,750
This is his robo

791
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,750
All right, let's put on my new parts

792
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,039
Ray one

793
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:57,880
That's all we got right now basic

794
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,000
freeway

795
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,239
ours three rounds and three rows

796
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,960
Aerial and ground shots are the same

797
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,560
It's easier to hit your target when shooting from the far so try to stay away. Yeah, let's try it

798
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,760
for this guy

799
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,880
standard

800
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,399
for this guy

801
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,520
standard

802
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,220
twin flank

803
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,659
Always one pod left and one pod right deploys two pods at one time

804
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:29,319
Right standard is all we got. All right, anything else?

805
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,159
Oh, let's just check this out

806
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,460
You can change the color too

807
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:44,750
Get into that

808
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:51,600
Mash buttons, right?

809
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,840
Okay, good jump on you. Ooh, this one's nice

810
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,609
Odd right

811
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:06,729
Ooh

812
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:23,229
This is the mouse thing the guy had

813
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:34,060
Get him get him get him get him get him doing missile spam

814
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:36,779
I'm not doing missile spam

815
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:46,840
But this is a fan art stream

816
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:52,699
This is not a fan art stream

817
01:10:53,420 --> 01:11:03,850
Shoots more missiles, but i'm not sure I like it more

818
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:18,140
All right. No, i'm no more length. You now have access to the standard bomb s. Oh, okay, cool

819
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:22,699
All right, open the game up for me. I want to start customizing fighting and leveling up

820
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:27,850
I'm gonna rest for a bit. Why don't you just go up against the computer?

821
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:30,489
No, I don't want to go because the computer

822
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,470
Is he putting me into the room with the bots?

823
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:49,500
Wait, I want to go to a parts generator. It's the only entire house that doesn't have a parts generator in it

824
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,520
Was saying

825
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,760
Where do you think you're going? I want to there we go. All right

826
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,399
standard bomb s

827
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:03,520
Oh cool

828
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,800
Somebody said you're on an emulator

829
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:10,039
Shut stop it

830
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:14,119
Once a robot stops moving it takes time for it to reach full movement speed again. Okay, cool

831
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:22,359
No, I own the game. I own the disk. I own everything. I own the wemos. I own the game cube controller

832
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,319
It's right there

833
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:27,960
I own it. I this is I own this game. I own it

834
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,439
I own it. I own the whole thing

835
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:34,409
Don't stop moving

836
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:39,680
Do you understand? Yeah

837
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,760
I am playing custom robo right now. I own the game cube. I own the disk. I own the game cube controller

838
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,000
That's I just I own it. That's all i'm telling you. I own this

839
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,710
Whatever. I'm fine

840
01:12:51,789 --> 01:12:57,960
Stop it

841
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,819
Others, okay. What was it called? There's a red. It was a bomb right

842
01:13:04,539 --> 01:13:07,079
standard s

843
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,560
basic functions fly straight forward

844
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:16,319
Launches one bomb at a time it mobilizes target launch as often as possible. So your opponent cannot hide behind walls. Cool. That's right

845
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:22,909
Why don't you prove it show your ankles ban that guy for at least three days

846
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,039
All right, here we go

847
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:42,640
All right, should I spam now?

848
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:53,399
Good. Oh what the spawn protection?

849
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:09,710
Shit i'm gonna lose to the plot

850
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:28,640
Around around around around

851
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,340
I don't like this standard b

852
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:38,380
I'm not a big fan of standard b

853
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:43,119
It's too spread out

854
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:49,710
Destroy him i'm trying

855
01:14:49,710 --> 01:15:04,560
It's the normal one, but it's better

856
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:16,649
I don't like it. I don't like it

857
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:28,359
No, please

858
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:40,680
Good no, fuck that rebirth shit. No

859
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:04,939
Games good speed pod. Wait, so can I just farm pods?

860
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,680
That was the wall. That was the tutorial wall

861
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,760
Speed pug let's see what it is

862
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,760
You got a speed pug

863
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:25,600
Okay, what does it do though?

864
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,409
Hey, where do you think you're going? I told you to practice. I just did I just kicked his ass

865
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,739
I'm done training you

866
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:42,829
Oh, you become vulnerable after you fire a gun use a slide shot to cover this

867
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:47,869
You press the b button while moving you can fire your gun while sliding in that direction

868
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,149
You use this skill properly. You can shoot while moving behind a wall

869
01:16:52,350 --> 01:17:00,720
a slide shot

870
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,060
All right, i'm gonna change some things here

871
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,579
Let's take the uh

872
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:18,109
speed pod right

873
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,310
speed d

874
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:22,939
Quickly fly straight ahead can deploy two pods at one time

875
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,520
tons of speed

876
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,520
No homing, right?

877
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,449
Standard s or yeah, we'll keep standard s

878
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:36,699
All right, let's try what's with game cube games and

879
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,619
Revoice tutorials

880
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:43,069
You know

881
01:17:43,069 --> 01:18:01,800
You know, I got three seconds on them already. All right, let's make this happen play right

882
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:16,590
speed pod

883
01:18:21,689 --> 01:18:36,800
Fast cpu

884
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
Fast vtuber versus what?

885
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:56,569
Damn it. This game's kind of challenging like in a fun way

886
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:12,489
Get him down. Get him down. Get him down. Get him down

887
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:14,590
Fuck you

888
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:26,409
Hey nintendo, what the fuck are you gonna remember the series? That's kids. What are you saying?

889
01:19:36,909 --> 01:19:38,909
Somebody did a spam and I couldn't read it

890
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:53,050
I'm doing the slide shot. We're not doing it. Well

891
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:59,260
All right, right here

892
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:08,479
Hey nintendo, I can't read it

893
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:14,680
Hey nintendo, when the fuck are you going to remember the series or remember f0 for more than aesthetic callbacks?

894
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,560
When are you going to remember kid icarus nintendo? Stop fucking around bring back the underdog games

895
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:22,970
You now have access to the criminal

896
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,329
Okay, cool

897
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:33,479
What's the criminal?

898
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:35,479
You got a criminal. Wait, what?

899
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,470
Is that a new robot?

900
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:43,579
Allow me to explain the trick flyer model

901
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:49,420
My robo utilizes this body type the trick flyer has excellent aerial ability. However, it moves slowly on the ground

902
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,560
Doesn't jump far, but it can do a quick air dash up to three times

903
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:59,359
When using a trick flyer, you should approach your opponent with an air dash and then attack

904
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,439
Get it

905
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:10,479
Oh, this looks cool

906
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:16,189
All right customize ray one. I got criminal

907
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,020
agile while airborne

908
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,079
Extremely slow on the ground

909
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,100
I kind of want red

910
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,460
Red blue that's not blue. That's

911
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:34,970
Green yellow

912
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:48,539
Marine I like this one better internet speed d

913
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,369
D is fine

914
01:21:51,369 --> 01:21:54,329
standard legs

915
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:57,079
I'm fine with this

916
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,640
All right. So this guy I can move very fast

917
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,279
Basic is just worse though. I know it is worse

918
01:22:05,079 --> 01:22:07,079
Cbd what you want to do cbd

919
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:39,229
Holy shit, this thing's awesome. You can go so fast in the air. All right, don't don't waste it actually kind of hard to do

920
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:57,069
He's horrible on the ground

921
01:22:57,069 --> 01:23:00,989
It takes a okay after you fire it takes a full like two seconds before you can do anything

922
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:07,359
Uh, I don't know this guy sucks. I don't like him

923
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:35,640
Characters terrible turn in the trash just snap him in half at the torso and just put it in the recycling bin

924
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:54,840
I don't care about the trick flyer. I'm gonna kill you with ray. Oh one not criminal. I want ray. Oh one

925
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,939
Yeah, he's better and he's green. I want blue ray one by the way

926
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,100
The speed thing no

927
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:20,859
Not a big fan. I like the the actual bullet bill travel ones

928
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,100
No

929
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,800
I'm using cover. I'm gonna use cover to my advantage now

930
01:24:55,119 --> 01:25:02,699
shit

931
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:13,960
Losing already. I'm fine

932
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:20,720
Fuck i'm definitely a standard b guy. I'll tell you that

933
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:35,050
down to down to

934
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:44,590
I hate that rebirth stuff. There's no standard b. Yeah, it's standard b. All right

935
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:50,880
What do I want right now? I want something. What do I want? I had some food earlier

936
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,359
M&I bomb p

937
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,560
Not food. I want okay like another coffee or

938
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:03,850
What do I want?

939
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:04,810
water

940
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:09,319
M&I bomb p

941
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:15,020
This is the last one here

942
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,500
You should take caution to prevent your rubble from being knocked down

943
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:22,319
If you receive a powerful attack or repeated attacks in a short period your rubble will overload

944
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,279
It's knocked down and vulnerable to attacks for a short time

945
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:28,720
However, you'll be invincible for a short time if you get up while your robot systems reboot

946
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,159
If you tap the buttons quickly your robot will rise more rapidly

947
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:36,810
Fuck your stomach get a milkshake. I'm gonna get a milkshake right now

948
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,859
We're gonna make a milkshake

949
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:46,939
Go open and get a blender put ice cream in it put some milk in it put chocolate syrup

950
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,340
It's gonna take like 12. That's gonna take like 15 minutes

951
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:55,359
I don't want a milkshake

952
01:26:55,359 --> 01:27:01,579
What's that new item?

953
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,409
M&I p

954
01:27:04,409 --> 01:27:06,649
Launches a split bomb towards either side of your foe

955
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,920
Launch two bombs at a time lingers for a while the blast target blows target sideways. I'll try it

956
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,199
I just punched you i'm sorry

957
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:22,199
He's lactose intolerant. No, not really

958
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,000
just have

959
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,199
issues

960
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:39,579
How can he already have been able to go does it look like?

961
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,319
M&I p

962
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:50,729
Hard to tell i'm gonna wrap around this side and then dash him

963
01:27:51,789 --> 01:27:58,359
It sucks

964
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:00,359
Oh, it's it spreads it out. I get it

965
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:08,279
Yeah, i'm not a big fan of it

966
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:22,800
What was that?

967
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:36,840
Oh, come on

968
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:46,000
This is homing

969
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,750
He's dead

970
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,550
Wow late again, huh? I I I don't even know what it said

971
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:00,039
Use the grenade launcher what is on the ground to linger

972
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:03,340
And you get hit multiple times you get the cockroach pod

973
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:10,430
Expertly done. All right. I did it. I see the tutorial is over

974
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:15,520
On the phone who could it be?

975
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,640
Hey, oh, where's harry that idiot turned his cell phone off again

976
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,439
Tell harry to call me back right now. Got it

01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:34,960
Cockroach pod. Come on. What's your phone number?

978
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,090
You want my phone number?

979
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:40,779
I could fool around. How about a date?

980
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,020
Hey, what is dill? Ernest wants me to call him back

981
01:29:45,659 --> 01:29:47,960
Oh, man, I was totally gonna get her number

01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
Okay, dill, let's go. I'm all pumped up

994
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:43,069
This is you button this person every time they call

995
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:47,159
On the first ring because you don't care

996
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,359
All right, we're going for hub park

997
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,039
a park

998
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:59,920
Yeah, you know the park with all the roads circling around it chief said something about a couple of young punks

999
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:02,640
Dooking it out with their robos

1000
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,199
Yes, some girl called us up asked us to make them stop

1001
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Sounds messy. We should get moving

1002
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,960
You're right. Come on. Let's go

1003
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:20,670
All right, which one are you?

1004
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:27,789
There they are wonderful what they're what they're fighting about. I wonder what the why do I care about this?

1005
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,960
Why do I have to get involved?

1006
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,600
Oh my god, no, uh, she's mine

1007
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:45,149
She's my date

1008
01:31:45,149 --> 01:31:47,340
Okay

1009
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,500
That were the land of the creeps. Okay

1010
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:58,300
I'm the one who called you these silly boys are farting over me because i'm so cute

1011
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,760
Well, I mean, I guess I did tell them to go out

1012
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:05,520
I did tell them i'd go out with them on the same day and time

1013
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,380
All right. This all right. This clearly is like a 45 year old dude that wrote this dialogue

1014
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:17,770
But I didn't know which one to cancel so I thought I'd just come out and see what happened

1015
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:27,850
And while I was waiting they saw each other and they started fighting over me. Well, what did you expect?

1016
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:33,210
So anyway, i'm like freaking out here. I called the police but they said they didn't have enough men

1017
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,800
I think you've got more than enough men already

1018
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,680
I'm not worried at all that you're here

1019
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,439
And so i'm gonna go home. Okay, i'll leave the rest up to someone now

1020
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:45,920
You're gonna there's gonna be two more people fighting over you

1021
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:52,170
You've just increased the amount of people that are fighting over you now. There's four of us here

1022
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:57,439
There was two you've just increased the amount of humans here i'm gonna go home

1023
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:03,869
Hey, she left but what about her dates?

1024
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,239
They're so mad at one another that they haven't even noticed that she dumped him

1025
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:13,529
Oh, well, let's face them one on one to try to chill them out a little

1026
01:33:14,409 --> 01:33:19,729
They'll pick a guy i'll handle the other. What are we fighting for?

1027
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,060
What song is that

1028
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:43,239
It's a mario song what the hell is it it's the water theme. Yeah, okay

1029
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,699
Oh and I suppose you've got a date with her too

1030
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:58,479
Okay, i'll straighten you out now. I'm gonna get kind of specific here on combat techniques

1031
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:03,439
Here's another tutorial for you the longer you hold the a button the higher you'll jump tap the a button to do a short jump

1032
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,000
You should try it out. Got it. Okay. Thank you

1033
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:15,479
Just do whatever you can do to beat it. It's a t-shirt. All right, what do you got?

1034
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:17,720

1035
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:26,380
Nice, okay good. I put my thumb up good dude. Good fucking job wicked. Good job

1036
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
This is gonna be easy

1037
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:37,789
And then I put the fucking vr helmet on all right. Keep ray

1038
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:42,880
Give an ip. I don't like it. I want standard

1039
01:34:44,329 --> 01:34:52,409
Standard only standard. I like I like the standard shit. What's the cockroach normally flies slowly

1040
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:57,079
Quickly increases speed when it spots its target. I'll try a cockroach

1041
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:12,810
That's boring to do standard everything. No, it's efficient. You're a basic bitch. Okay

1042
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:24,430
All right, get in there. Oh they're little cockroaches. It's awesome

1043
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,010

Oh, that is pretty nice

1045
01:35:35,609 --> 01:35:43,260
Come on. What's up with that?

1046
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:51,710

1047
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:06,090

01:36:08,989 --> 01:36:11,039
I'm working on it

1050
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:19,289
That was pretty good. It just didn't hit him

1051
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:21,289
Sorry, uh, no no date for you

1052
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,600
Oh, man, yeah, you mean

1053
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,199
Losing in a fight against some dude does it you mean I can't date her now

1054
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:36,239
What does she think about this?

1055
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:40,159
Well, I do like you but you lost in the battle. So now you're my boyfriend

1056
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:49,359
What the what?

1057
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:52,720
Good grief, let's get out of here

1058
01:36:52,720 --> 01:37:08,380
Yeah, nope. Uh-oh

1059
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:14,510
You'll pay for this

1060
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:16,510
Thanks marcy. He saved me

1061
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,039
Don't mention it

1062
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:22,479
Oh, you must be dale our new partner, right? I'm marcia

1063
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:25,720
That takes four or five cans of spray

1064
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:35,390
Hairspray to get that to be like that probably more it's probably glue. Oh, um, well, I have class b license dale

1065
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:39,130
Say dale, what's your license class?

1066
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:43,449
If I tell you if it's if it's under b, are you not gonna date me?

1067
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:53,260
License was that I mean you have to do that

1068
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,380
License who was that?

1069
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,140
What?

1070
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,140
You don't have a license

1071
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,840
He's an amateur. Of course. He ain't got no license

1072
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,079
But if you're a bounty hunter and you don't have a license you can get arrested

1073
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,550
That's right. I forgot

1074
01:38:13,550 --> 01:38:15,550
Harry, how could you forget something like that?

1075
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:25,420
You know that that's why nobody's got any respect for the steel hearts for getting stuff like that. Give me a break

1076
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:28,890
I just slipped my mind

1077
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:35,689
Well, okay. I've got a problem. Let's head back to the office. Harry is low-key stupid

1078
01:38:37,609 --> 01:38:51,520
Uh, he's high-key stupid new party member unlocked a license. Oh, yeah that I guess that's not such a bad idea

1079
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:58,779
But licenses cost money money we don't have yeah, but no matter how good you are if you don't have a license that will arrest you

1080
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,319
Well, that's your own business. It's not my fault if you guys get taken by the cops

1081
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:09,680
I could have sworn that the law places full responsibility on an employer of a robo commander

1082
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:13,609
What are you serious?

1083
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:16,329
All right, then

1084
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:19,369
All right. I want you to take take him and get his license tomorrow

Okay, he shouldn't have a problem getting a class d license a class d license that's burned in my brain sure

1087
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:38,010
Sure. No problem

1088
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,729
Hey, are you aware of what you're having to go to do with the test?

1089
01:39:41,529 --> 01:39:44,649
Anyway, uh, you take that class d license test tomorrow

1090
01:39:45,529 --> 01:39:49,930
If you don't pass that license linda's reward is out the window. That's right. I'm not gonna get anything

1091
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:52,010
That's not to mention that it'll get you arrested

1092
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:55,289
You're gonna go to jail. You're gonna go to jail for the rest of your life. Listen harry

1093
01:39:55,369 --> 01:39:57,369
You've got to absolutely got to make sure that he passes

1094
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:03,050
It's impossible. What do you want a simple assistant like me to do?

1095
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:06,670
Stop complaining. It's not for rick

1096
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:11,710
Stop complaining. Uh, I don't want you to come back until uh jail passes what?

1097
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:17,720
You don't want me to die

1098
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,810
Oh the test right

1099
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:26,409
Which reminds me you're class d too. Why don't you take the class c while you're there? Wait, he's class d

1100
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:30,619
No way, who do you think you're kidding?

1101
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:35,449

01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,810
As long as i'm in this business a class d license is plenty

1106
01:40:53,689 --> 01:40:57,689
Hey, isn't it about time you took the class a test? How many times have you tried?

1107
01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:08,329
I'm so scared of something

1108
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,710
This isn't good. Hmm

1109
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:13,949
Everyone's worked hard today. You can all go home

1110
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:21,119
A little lazy fuck you can even get up and walk

1111

He left

1112
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,439
You should go home, too

1113

01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:55,500

1235
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:46,989

Sorry, I didn't get put on that list

1237
01:52:48,989 --> 01:52:51,619

No

1242
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:12,500
You show it to your parents your parents go excellent work

1243
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:15,380
And then you forget it existed ever again

1244
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,600
And then your parents forget it existed

1245
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:25,600
Like a month later like six months later. It's like oh, you're just like you're just you're just a person now

1246
01:53:29,489 --> 01:53:31,890
He's mad. I'm not gonna get my intelligence

01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,050

01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:49,659
Yeah, you do. Did you pass?

1252
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:57,579
4.6 doesn't even matter

1253
01:54:01,949 --> 01:54:03,550
See you later trish

1254
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:14,670
What you should be caring about is not about how high your gpa is

1255
01:54:15,069 --> 01:54:18,909
But what you are retaining from the shit that you want to learn

1256
01:54:20,609 --> 01:54:24,789
That's the that's way more important than having like a 4.0 gpa

1257
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:30,510
How much are you taking how much are you retaining? How many skills are you developing develop some skills develop some brain power?

1258
01:54:30,909 --> 01:54:35,470
Oh, I didn't get I got a d on this who fucking cares. You got a d on that test who gives a shit

1259
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:38,899
What did you learn?

1260
01:54:38,899 --> 01:54:42,899
When when my son or daughter goes to college and they come back and they're like dad

1261
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:48,340
I got like a 2.1 2.2. Let me see that i'll let me see

1262
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:51,460
Okay. All right. What did you learn though?

1263
01:54:51,869 --> 01:54:53,310
Show me what you've learned

1264
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:58,859
And then they'll pull out like a piano and like start playing a fucking beautiful song and i'll be like there you go

1265
01:54:58,859 --> 01:55:01,180
That's what you've learned. Whatever you're doing. I don't care. Whatever it is. Good work

1266
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:08,560
What are you retaining not what are you remembering? That's way more important

1267
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:11,060
think about that

1268
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:16,279
Tests a test. What are you retaining versus? What are you remembering?

1269
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:21,079
Short term to get a passing grade

1270
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:44,229
Keep that in mind. It's very very important. It's too bad employers. Don't think like that. Some of them do some of them do

1271
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:50,630
omega q

1272
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:57,510
Okay. All right. Do you want to talk about like productivity and like what makes a good employment environment?

1273
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,220
Which this should be a four-day work week

1274
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:05,220
You know how much more shit people get done not spending five six days a week

1275
01:56:05,859 --> 01:56:07,859
You get way more shit done

1276
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:20,239
But you get a 15 minute break every eight hours here at the job

1277
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:26,640
Oh, you you bet you're stressing out. You've got too much stuff to do. You're not being able to take breaks

1278
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,039
Your your mind can't function that way

1279
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:35,520
We need a four goddamn work week. I'm not talking less work, by the way. I'm not talking everybody should do

1280
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,840
Don't do less

1281
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:42,560
You get way more done when you have less time. It's weird, but it's true

1282
01:56:43,779 --> 01:56:48,579
When you're working for less time, you have more time to spread out your brain and be able to actually

1283
01:56:49,220 --> 01:57:04,149
Develop your brain off work. It's trust me. It's scientific. Look it up not 14 hours a day

1284
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:15,090
No, same time less days unionize your workplace. Thanks for this five subs

1285
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:20,399
We're not talking about any we're not talking. I'm just talking about productivity. All right

1286
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:29,399
And why do you have the mods work a hundred plus hours a week? Shut up

1287
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:35,090
Hey, um, i'm kidding

1288
01:57:35,829 --> 01:57:36,960
um

1289
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:42,739
You should no dude you got that's i'll we'll talk about that later. Good job

1290
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:47,590
I've got some business to take care of. I want to leave right now

1291
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:58,710
If you two are going to be partners, you ought to spend some quality time together

1292
01:57:59,189 --> 01:58:04,180
Chat on the way home and get to know each other partners. Why can't marcia be his partner?

1293
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:07,619
The marcia can't handle herself

1294
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:11,460
And you're the one who told me to hire dale in the first place

1295
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:16,390
Why does everything bad always happen to me?

1296
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:22,340
I think he's drinking his own tears

1297
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:33,840
He is ugly crying

1298
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,859
Okay, uh

1299
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:40,100
I gotta be honest. I was not hey, I was not retaining any of that information

1300
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:44,659
I was just saying it or remembering it short term. What happened there? I don't know. Where am I going?

1301
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:52,369
I didn't retain any of that

1302
01:58:52,369 --> 01:58:59,029
Not even short term

1303
01:58:59,029 --> 01:59:02,180
I didn't fail the test

1304
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:07,590
You would take you were talking during it. It's talking during the test. Where would we need to go training gym?

1305
01:59:07,909 --> 01:59:13,619
It's a square root of what's a square root of what's the square root of 16?

1306
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,159
um

1307
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:17,460
I don't know

1308
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:19,880
I don't care

1309
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,689
Wait, where were we actually going?

1310
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:25,409
I was not paying a single attention at all. Is it the training grounds?

1311
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:30,479
It's about go to marcia, right?

1312
01:59:32,119 --> 01:59:33,399
Go home

1313
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:36,520
All right, spend quality time with this person. All right, let's let's go bowling or something

1314
01:59:37,159 --> 01:59:42,789
Don't tell him. I mean don't tell him tell me

1315
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:48,840
Hmm your dad, huh? And that's why you want to work

1316
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,239
Well, everyone's got a reason

1317
01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:54,760
Anyway, as of today, you're a full-fledged bounty hunter. Do your best. See ya

1318
01:59:55,479 --> 02:00:04,119
Okay, gotta get back home and call trish

1319
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:12,949
Is that trish's number?

1320
02:00:13,109 --> 02:00:18,130
Is that the comic relief there that that's the number that he dropped? I guess yeah

1321
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:27,329
Dale get up

1322
02:00:27,329 --> 02:00:29,090
Hurry up and go to work

1323
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:42,600
The person only has two outfits

1324
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:45,670
That's sort of strange

1325
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:47,029
feather legs

1326
02:00:47,029 --> 02:00:56,600
Which I can fly

1327
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,600
What do you call this?

1328
02:01:01,159 --> 02:01:03,159
I don't know

1329
02:01:03,239 --> 02:01:06,949
They're being awfully loud this morning

1330
02:01:08,869 --> 02:01:10,069
Do I care?

1331
02:01:10,069 --> 02:01:15,510
I know you're curious, but it's not right to go poking around in other people's business. I'll do it later

1332
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:21,810
uh

1333
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:35,079
Okay

1334
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:37,079
Good morning

1335
02:01:37,159 --> 02:01:45,829
Now you just got here dale, but I need you to go back to your apartment

1336
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:47,590
Huh?

1337
02:01:47,590 --> 02:01:51,750
There's a married couple fighting over at your apartment building and they're using robos

1338
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:55,569
They got a call from the landlady. She said it's out of her control

1339
02:01:56,289 --> 02:01:58,289
She requested you specifically

1340
02:01:59,569 --> 02:02:02,369
Oh, I thought so. Hey harry go with them

1341
02:02:03,909 --> 02:02:06,310
And i'm fine. It sounds like a crummy job

1342
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:09,189
Dale can handle it myself

1343
02:02:09,829 --> 02:02:13,430
I'm totally bummed today. I had my chance yesterday and I blew it

1344
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:17,270
Stop complaining and go

1345
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:19,810
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll go

1346
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:23,680
Oh tritch

1347
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,319
Oh, where did I put that note with your number on it?

1348
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:46,479
Harry

1349
02:02:46,479 --> 02:03:00,050
All right, dude, come on. Hi. Thanks for coming back. Dale

1350
02:03:00,869 --> 02:03:02,960
When did you call earnest?

1351
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,960
Right after you left. It's so awful

1352
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,720
Oh, who's this?

1353
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,960
Hmm. Oh, that's harry

1354
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,960
Oh, really? Is he a stolen horse too?

1355
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:12,880
Oh

1356
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:18,159
That's what our hands are doing. He's quite a hunk of a man. Get me his number. Will you?

1357
02:03:20,289 --> 02:03:21,970
It's sweet of you

1358
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:31,170
We talk about the job here of what's going on. Oh, right, right. Walt and his wife are fighting and it's getting crazy

1359
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:36,449
They're using their robos to fight and their children are crying. I tried to stop them, but

1360
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:44,199
I don't know a thing about robos. You know that I didn't have a clue how to stop them and that's why I

1361
02:03:45,319 --> 02:03:47,319
I called stolen horse

1362
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:49,960
I also wanted to see what you like when you had work

1363
02:03:51,989 --> 02:03:53,989
Thanks

1364
02:03:53,989 --> 02:04:06,000
Dale, let's cut the chat and go stop them. Yeah, you're right. Good luck turning into roger

1365
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:12,020
Man, this is bad. Let's wrap this up quickly

1366
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:15,699
I'll stop the husband

1367
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:20,739
You go handle his wife. They're all it's turning. Yeah, it's either roger or neelix. It turns back and forth somehow

1368
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,840
I've turned the safety switch on so that nobody gets hurt

1369
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:30,550
What's a safety switch?

1370
02:04:30,789 --> 02:04:35,859
It's a switch that describes decreases your robo's power to prevent you from hurting your opponent

1371
02:04:36,579 --> 02:04:42,289
The switch is on the robo cube. If you turn the safety switch on and dive the safety mechanics will automatically kick in

1372
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:44,770
It won't look any different

1373
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:45,890
Okay

1374
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:51,779
Can we get should we do an investigation?

1375
02:04:53,989 --> 02:04:57,319
Man, let's get along

1376
02:04:57,319 --> 02:05:02,500
Yeah, stop fighting

1377
02:05:07,909 --> 02:05:16,039
Holy shit

1378
02:05:16,039 --> 02:05:18,039
What you're taking his side

1379
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,460
Don't mess with me

1380
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:25,460
Be your opponent my metal ape. It's a metal grappler

1381
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:28,340
little grappler

1382
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:34,039
Got a little excited there. The metal grappler has extremely high defense

1383
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:39,399
It's hard for it to get knocked down. But since it moves slow, I have a hard time dodging it down

1384
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:41,880
I can only do one air dash

1385
02:05:42,359 --> 02:05:43,640
Oh

1386
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:48,600
I'm gonna lean in real close. I usually focus on attacking rather than worrying about a little damage

1387
02:05:49,479 --> 02:05:55,779
Got it

1388
02:05:55,779 --> 02:05:57,119
Got it

1389
02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:01,350
Huh?

1390
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:03,350
Why am I explaining all of this to you?

1391
02:06:07,909 --> 02:06:10,600
Yeah, why are you telling me this?

1392
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:16,500
Got a cool sword

1393
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:21,920
All right. So just hide I like this. I currently like this

1394
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:25,220
Battle

1395
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:27,970
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that line by the way

1396
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:33,409
Hey, you require my assistance. Let's see. I could do a better job than that. You require my assistance

1397
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:36,119
your battle

1398
02:06:36,119 --> 02:06:38,119
That's better. That's what he sounded like in warcraft 3

1399
02:06:38,359 --> 02:06:50,560
I would have done just replace it

1400
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:53,119
What an ego maniac

1401
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:57,670
Don't say that don't say that or you're gonna get fucking banned

1402
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:01,779
All right. This the dash is way better

1403
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:13,350
Send out the mice. We just have to dodge. This is an ape type, right?

1404
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:21,239
Knock them down

1405
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:22,600
Good volley

1406
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,529
Thermal punching. Fuck you

1407
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:28,609
You don't don't use me against me. Okay

1408
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:31,800
Don't forget. That's me punching

1409
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:36,180
I'm gonna punch myself

1410
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:37,619
Careful with that emo

1411
02:07:37,619 --> 02:07:39,590
There's lava in this thing

1412
02:07:39,590 --> 02:07:57,060
Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself

1413
02:07:57,619 --> 02:08:25,329
That was clean. Thermal slaps himself. Why are you doing that? Nobody has raided

1414
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,239
We don't have a raid

1415
02:08:29,239 --> 02:08:31,800
Why are you embarrassing me in front of a raid that doesn't exist?

1416
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:41,890
vertical gun

1417
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:44,369
Ow, ow, right that burns me up

1418
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:49,220
That was a waste of time. Let's head back to the office

1419
02:08:51,909 --> 02:08:53,189
Oh, oh, oh

1420
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:55,189
Are you hurt dear who hurt you?

1421
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:58,479
That crudely dressed punk over there

1422
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:02,560
What are you talking about? You're hurt because you've gotten a stupid fight with your wife

1423
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:05,279
I only calmed you down

1424
02:09:05,729 --> 02:09:08,449
How dare you hurt my hubby?

1425
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:13,970
Get up, dear. We'll defeat these evil villains and show them that our love is strong

1426
02:09:14,689 --> 02:09:16,930
That's right. I love you

1427
02:09:18,149 --> 02:09:27,939
I love you, too

1428
02:09:27,939 --> 02:09:30,260
What does this happen to happen to me? I'm just some guy

1429
02:09:31,649 --> 02:09:33,649
Hey, Dale, come here. We're gonna beat him up

1430
02:09:34,289 --> 02:09:40,470
You never had a two-on-two battle before have you it's when two people team up on two others

1431
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:42,949
What are you doing?

1432
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:45,270
Sorry, just wait one minute. I have to explain to the new guy

1433
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:48,550
Hey, Dale, listen carefully. I'll explain two-on-two battles

1434
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:52,420
At least they're aware, right?

1435
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:55,699
Basic controls are the same as the one-on-one battles, but there's one difference

1436
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:59,859
The arrow on top of your robo's head locks onto one of your opponents

1437
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:02,659
You want to change your target? You have to press Y

1438
02:10:03,539 --> 02:10:05,539
Okay, good thing I didn't skip that

1439
02:10:12,739 --> 02:10:14,899
You're red and i'm blue and our opponents are green and yellow

1440
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:19,239
Every time you press Y the colored arrow above the changes and it goes that way. Okay

1441
02:10:20,039 --> 02:10:23,239
I told you i'm blue. What good does it do to shoot your own partner?

1442
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:26,399
You can't fire your gun while you're changing targets

1443
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:28,760
Are you done yet?

1444
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,760
Sorry, there's just a little bit more one more second

1445
02:10:31,079 --> 02:10:33,939
Your opponents have colored arrows over their heads, too

1446
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:37,460
Those arrows turn red. That means that they're locked on to you

1447
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:41,750
Got it got it got it. Now listen

1448
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:44,949
Look carefully at the colored arrows and see who's locked on to who?

1449
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:50,369
Keep that in mind while you fight

1450
02:10:50,369 --> 02:10:52,689
All right nightbot just said i've been live for two hours and 11 minutes

1451
02:10:52,689 --> 02:10:56,369
I thought someone was chatting saying germa. It's been two hours and 11 minutes resident sleeper

1452
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:13,569
Actually, this is I like this. I'm gonna stay with what I got. I like it. Oh by the way tomorrow

1453
02:11:14,449 --> 02:11:17,729
Tomorrow is part two of dlc movie night

1454
02:11:18,529 --> 02:11:22,180
And watch the rest of the playlist

1455
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:25,640
I'm already up

1456
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:28,770
Wait, is that my friend?

1457
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:34,869
No, that's not this is a little confusing. All right, i'm gonna i'm with this guy this guy down here

1458
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:47,890
How are you doing over there?

1459
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:53,970
No, no, keep attacking him attack him

1460
02:11:54,449 --> 02:11:55,649
Yes

1461
02:11:55,649 --> 02:12:06,760
Take out the big guy first focus the big guy

1462
02:12:07,399 --> 02:12:09,329
What are you dumb?

1463
02:12:09,329 --> 02:12:19,010
All right, that's it

1464
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:21,569
Don't even let him get up

1465
02:12:21,569 --> 02:12:27,779
I'll just rain missiles. You just do all the work

1466
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:43,359
Good job. When does this guy take off his pants?

1467
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,479
You're talking about me. Um, that doesn't happen on stream

1468
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:53,250
Oh, I got access to the metal ape

1469
02:12:53,409 --> 02:12:56,039
spider pod

1470
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,640
Do oh, do you two have to be so cute? Give me a break

1471
02:13:01,279 --> 02:13:04,640
We've got our safety switches on and they're going at it for real. This ain't a joke

1472
02:13:08,289 --> 02:13:10,560
Are you two okay?

1473
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,479
What are you doing here marcia?

1474
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:14,920
The chief was worried about you. He said

1475
02:13:15,619 --> 02:13:18,899
Where's this going? I'm not sure where this is going. It's going somewhere

1476
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:22,100
I don't know where it was. I guess we're just gonna do this

1477
02:13:22,659 --> 02:13:29,539
The chief was worried about you. He said you weren't your normal self today. Hey great. Well, you've got perfect timing. It's all over

1478
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,939
I see

1479
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:34,340
But how do things turn so ugly so quickly?

1480
02:13:34,979 --> 02:13:40,289
That's what I like to know man. What a mess

1481
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:46,149
He was washing my husband's clothes this morning and I found a note in his coat pocket

1482
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:51,670
There was a phone number on it. I didn't know what it was. I called it and a young lady answered

1483
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:54,470
I was certain that my husband was cheating on me

1484
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:59,109
But honey, I told you I just found that note out front this morning

1485
02:13:59,829 --> 02:14:05,670
I believe you you never do anything like that. I'm sorry. I lost my temper. I'm sure it was only a prank

1486
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:11,560
Really? Who would have planted that thing out where you'd find it like that?

1487
02:14:12,279 --> 02:14:17,409
Prank or no prank. I I hope you're sorry. We're bruised up because of your stupid fight

1488
02:14:19,859 --> 02:14:24,340
Harry, please stop. There are children here and you're scaring them

1489
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:33,029
I'll get them. I'm the murloc. What's from the

1490
02:14:33,909 --> 02:14:35,510
The game heart has done

1491
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:39,510
What's his name? Sir Finley, right? Sir Finley

1492
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:44,149
I've played look every stream is the every stream is the last thing that I did

1493
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:46,069
Okay

1494
02:14:46,069 --> 02:14:53,409
The last thing that I did you guys are gonna hear about it all day every time. What do you want me to do?

1495
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:56,279
It's just up there and I can't get it out

1496
02:14:56,439 --> 02:15:00,680
And I don't like it. I think the game's stupid now, but like I played it and that's all that's up there. I can't help it

1497
02:15:01,319 --> 02:15:09,640
This is how memories work

1498
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:16,100
Fucking boomer loser

1499
02:15:16,819 --> 02:15:18,039
All right

1500
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:25,189
You get some leeway but all right, that's time up for 10 minutes i'm out for 10 minutes

1501
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,520
Who's ready for some adventure?

1502
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,199
see

1503
02:15:58,199 --> 02:16:00,199
CBD CBD

1504
02:16:00,359 --> 02:19:10,360
I'm going to get a water relax a glass of water and I got some coffee just a little bit more

1505
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:21,889
Weed infused coffee that would be I'm not a fan of that kind of stuff

1506
02:19:22,690 --> 02:19:25,409
I don't like just i'm just gonna just give it to me just someone want to eat it

1507
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:31,270
I don't want like weed infused fucking like salmon fillets. No, I don't want that

1508
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:36,930
I don't want like a weed infused coke product. No, just I just just give it to me. I'll eat it

1509
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:42,280
If you're into that stuff, cool. They're cool. That's i'm glad you are

1510
02:19:43,079 --> 02:19:49,600
I just want to eat it

1511
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,920
Weed and cocaine mixed together

1512
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:54,639
No, don't do that. That's a terrible idea

1513
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:59,399
Don't do that. We found this in front of our front doorstep

1514
02:20:07,569 --> 02:20:10,930
Don't we stop blinking me though like mustache hair guy. I saw it

1515
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:14,719
It was written by a girl. She has cute handwriting

1516
02:20:20,899 --> 02:20:22,899
Cute, let me see

1517
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:26,870
Whoa

1518
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:35,319
I'll take this as evidence. Give me that

1519
02:20:35,319 --> 02:20:39,079
Modded 3d movie maker characters got it figured it out. It's taking me a while. That's what this is

1520
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:43,729
It's nothing. I can't let a helpless girl carry around a heavy load, you know

1521
02:20:44,290 --> 02:20:52,129
It's just a piece of paper. It's great. Everything worked out. Don't they look good together and they lived happily ever after

1522
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:57,799
Harry are you all right?

1523
02:20:57,799 --> 02:20:59,479
Uh, what do you mean?

1524
02:20:59,479 --> 02:21:04,840
Just a second ago you were furious, but now furious. Oh me. I've made a love. Hey deal. You need to lighten up

1525
02:21:05,799 --> 02:21:08,680
Married couples have their reasons for things. You gotta give them some slack

1526
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:12,659
Got it

1527
02:21:12,659 --> 02:21:16,549
Okay kids

1528
02:21:16,549 --> 02:21:19,590
Are you scared your parents are fine now? Everything's all right

1529
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:24,360
Listen to me when i'm talking what i'm talking we're talking to the children now harry

1530
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,389
Stop

1531
02:21:26,389 --> 02:21:29,079
Come on. Let's go play over there

1532
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:32,000
Marcia

1533
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,020
So you both want to be commanders when you grow up? How about a custom robo game?

1534
02:21:36,899 --> 02:21:44,069
Sheesh, what's wrong surprised to see marcia being nice to the kids

1535
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:53,379
Um, I don't I don't care. I don't care at all. Like that's cool. Nice. Why would you not be nice to kids?

1536
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:55,379
I don't care

1537
02:21:55,379 --> 02:21:58,840
Come on. Hear me out. She's actually a nice person. I okay

1538
02:22:00,209 --> 02:22:01,729
You see

1539
02:22:01,729 --> 02:22:05,090
Time to lure dump on you marcia's parents passed away a few years ago

1540
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:09,250
It was just her and her big brother her big brother was an elite member of the police squad marcia got along

1541
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:11,489
Well with her brother real well her brother took good care of her

1542
02:22:11,649 --> 02:22:16,049
But one day marcia's brother up and quit the police squad without a word and then he just disappeared. No one's seen him since

1543
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:18,920
okay

1544
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,280
um then

1545
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:23,799
Okay, not only did marcia lose her parents, but she also lost an older brother. That's

1546
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:27,299
I don't know this like this is the appropriate place to do this

1547
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:30,020
Like in this house here

1548
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:33,940
And now she's alone. Yeah, that sort of sums it up

1549
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:40,389
I've said this is like a situation where you we leave and you pull me aside

1550
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:43,030
And say hey, just want to let you know a couple things

1551
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:47,110
He's doing he's like just monologuing in this person's living room

1552
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:53,879
I feel the same way for a long time marcia has been gifted with a strange power. Uh, oh

1553
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:56,920
Uh-oh

1554
02:22:56,920 --> 02:23:03,879
That girl's got a strange power. She's like a god. She has god powers and and she I got it. I got it

1555
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:10,340
Because of that she's always been the quiet type. She used to be a lot happier

1556
02:23:11,059 --> 02:23:15,940
And now she's lost her parents and her big brother shut up from the world and unable to reach out to anyone

1557
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:17,700
She's gotten a lot better though

1558
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:22,709
The reason marcia wants a class a license is because she wants to join the police squad

1559
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:27,190
Can't join the police squad unless you get a class a license. How was I supposed to know that I failed that on the test

1560
02:23:27,829 --> 02:23:33,520
She probably wants to track down some clues on her brother herself

1561
02:23:43,559 --> 02:23:50,639
Hey, laugh, how do I uncook luigi? I accidentally dropped him in the deep fryer

1562
02:23:52,209 --> 02:23:57,969
Uh, well, you're gonna be in big trouble because that's half of uh nintendo's like entire

1563
02:23:59,159 --> 02:24:00,360
fan base

1564
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:02,600
and library

1565
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:04,600
You're gonna have to come up with a solution for that

1566
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:15,780
What am I saying that somebody said somebody said that

1567
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,959
I didn't say that

1568
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:22,959
Will you guys think that i'm saying this?

1569
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:26,260
Oh shit, I did say it like I just said it

1570
02:24:26,899 --> 02:24:30,260
Yes, they did say that I will find it right now before I get still lost in the chat

1571
02:24:33,170 --> 02:24:39,110
I'm just like insane and i'm sitting here going okay. How do I uncook luigi guys? I dropped him in the fryer

1572
02:24:41,479 --> 02:24:45,000
I I gotta find it somebody fucking really said that and it was fucked

1573
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:58,709
Like yeah, it's gone. Okay, let's head back to the office awesome. I got trish's number back

1574
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:07,409
Yeah, so germa owns the game and he'd rather emulate it. Am I wrong?

1575
02:25:08,739 --> 02:25:12,930
Um mike listen sometimes some games have problems being captured

1576
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:18,049
They become uncapturable happens with a lot of them actually

1577
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:21,409
Try to pull it through a capture device and the audio might be all messed up

1578
02:25:21,409 --> 02:25:23,729
It could be a huge problem. The disc could be scratched

1579
02:25:24,209 --> 02:25:28,239
Doesn't mean you don't own it. I know not all of them. Excuse me

1580
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:32,000
Excuse me, not all of them only like three ever

1586
02:25:55,969 --> 02:25:59,319
If we catch that marv, we should get a big reward

1587
02:26:00,450 --> 02:26:03,090

02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:21,030
My camera is broken remember from yesterday. Hold on. What the fuck? Why is it so tiny?

1596
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:38,930
You guys see me

1597
02:27:38,930 --> 02:27:40,770
Why is this so small?

1606
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:19,989
Hmm

1607
02:28:19,989 --> 02:28:24,069
This looks like a gamecube disc of custom robo, doesn't it? By the way, here's the controller

1608
02:28:24,709 --> 02:28:27,010
Here's the controller is the gamecube controller by the way

Looks like it

1615
02:29:13,799 --> 02:29:15,799
It's a router

1616
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:20,420

1622
02:29:39,479 --> 02:29:44,120
Flexing on your viewers but proving that I own the game the console and the controller

1623
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:52,739
Okay, here we go. The chief wants us to go to bogies

1624
02:29:53,540 --> 02:29:55,219
That guy is the reward

1625
02:29:55,219 --> 02:29:57,219
All right. I'm gonna do us all a favor

1626
02:29:57,219 --> 02:29:59,219
Uh

1627
02:30:03,459 --> 02:30:05,459
I like my cup

1628
02:30:13,090 --> 02:30:15,090
No skipping miku. No

1629
02:30:18,799 --> 02:30:20,799
How do I unpoop my pants?

1630
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:22,879
Waddle over to the toilet

1631
02:30:22,879 --> 02:30:27,520
Take your underwear off and just take the underwear and turn it upside down and dump it into the toilet and then just

1632
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Throw the underwear in the trash done

1633
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:38,229
His name is evil

1634
02:30:38,229 --> 02:30:45,510
Harry and marcia. No, I get a bit of harry and marcy. What's going on? Oh great. Not him

1635
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:50,469
Harry harry harry still have the manners of a kindergarten. Eh

1636
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:55,700
I assume you're here for the notorious outlaw marv

1637
02:30:57,059 --> 02:31:01,540
I'm sorry, but you're too late dark blue. Oh more specifically. I

1638
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:04,899
Evil have already captured the rogue

1639
02:31:06,399 --> 02:31:07,440
Darn it

1640
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:09,440
Dark blue got the reward

1641
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:16,290
How did you know that marv was here?

1642
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:23,559
So you want to learn my secrets you hope to benefit from my wisdom perhaps. Okay, i'll tell you

1643
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:28,920
One of something weird about voices and acting and just hearing people talk very loudly

1644
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:31,559
I'm gonna ruin every single thing for you ever

1645
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,040
You are now going to hear

1646
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:37,620
all the huge intakes

1647
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:39,299
of air

1648
02:31:39,299 --> 02:31:43,350
When people do voice acting now, it's all you're gonna hear

1649
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:47,719
Even when you watch the news, you're not gonna hear the breath

1650
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:53,700
When newscasters talk especially anchors or reporters

1651
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:56,239
Just listen

1652
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:58,399
So we are here live on the scene and i'm here

1653
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:01,110
You'll hear it

1654
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:03,909
It turns out the car drove past all these

1655
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:07,030
Yeah, that's just how it happens now

1656
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:10,690
That's all you'll hear

1657
02:32:10,690 --> 02:32:12,610
Don't listen don't listen

1658
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:24,260
That's not how normal people breathe. Just listen next time i'm gonna drive somebody insane

1659
02:32:25,059 --> 02:32:30,819
Because he's gonna people are gonna be like no, no, he's right. It's the only thing I could hear

1660
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:41,280
Bogey here officially requested the services of my little mercenary crew dark now i'm freaking out because you're gonna hear it

1661
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:44,799
What bogey why?

1662
02:32:44,879 --> 02:32:47,760
But you told us you always go to steel hearts when you've got trouble

1663
02:32:53,459 --> 02:32:56,739
Well, your boss has been here all day sucking down coffee and

1664
02:32:57,620 --> 02:33:02,280
And what and he was sitting in a dark corner all by himself?

1665
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:04,920
Writing poetry and occasionally weeping

1666
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:12,770
How can I rely on you guys when your boss is such a space cadet poetry i'd be worried too

1667
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:22,659
Young earnest is a poet and you didn't know it. Oh, this is too shit. It's all I hear

1668
02:33:30,739 --> 02:33:33,889
I did it myself

1669
02:33:33,889 --> 02:33:38,209
Hmm. Well now aren't you the kid who came in looking for a job with dark blue not too long ago?

1670
02:33:38,690 --> 02:33:41,329
Of course, that's right. Your name's dale

1671
02:33:42,690 --> 02:33:44,690
You apply to dark blue too

1672
02:33:45,639 --> 02:33:46,840
Yeah

1673
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:48,680
I applied to lots of places

1674
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:53,649
I applied a lot. This is not me making a joke. This is real life now

1675
02:33:54,209 --> 02:33:58,049
Don't act coy evil knows your name. You must have applied at dark blue

1676
02:33:58,930 --> 02:34:03,170
So you couldn't get into dark blue and we're next on your list fine with me

1677
02:34:04,690 --> 02:34:09,889
Oh, what is with you ceaseless blathering harry. Are you saying you know dale too?

1678
02:34:10,930 --> 02:34:12,049
Wait

1679
02:34:12,049 --> 02:34:13,649
Don't tell me

1680
02:34:13,649 --> 02:34:15,889
Did steel hearts hire this amateur?

1681
02:34:16,610 --> 02:34:18,610
That is rich

1682
02:34:25,639 --> 02:34:28,680
Shut your face

1683
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:31,879
Dale has tons of talent and someday he'll be an excellent commander

1684
02:34:33,809 --> 02:34:35,809
At least that's what linda says

1685
02:34:35,889 --> 02:34:41,090
I have to stop paying him. All right, i'm gonna I need 30 30 seconds to recalibrate and just forget about the thing that I just

1686
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:42,629
Told you guys

1687
02:34:42,629 --> 02:34:44,629
It's it's it's fucking up my brain

1688
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:57,350
I've got an idea somebody somebody somebody sounds like a skipping cd

1689
02:34:58,229 --> 02:35:14,159
Oh, he sounds like a skipping like what did you say breathe and blink manually stop it

1690
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:18,799
Why did I do this to myself? I casted a spell back at myself accidentally

1691
02:35:21,489 --> 02:35:24,610
And all of you in chat are going to have one arm now

1692
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:27,170
And it bounced back in a mirror. Oh shit

1693
02:35:28,549 --> 02:35:30,549
I have now I have one arm now

1694
02:35:36,850 --> 02:35:41,250
reversed

1695
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:43,649
Yeah, i've got a few verses for you right here

1696
02:35:44,370 --> 02:35:48,209
Oh very witty harry. Have you ever considered a change of career? Perhaps as a clown?

1697
02:35:49,889 --> 02:35:51,889
Enough chit chat. We're leaving now

1698
02:35:53,569 --> 02:35:56,690
Dale if you do turn out to be a worthy commander we'll make you an offer

1699
02:35:57,489 --> 02:36:06,659
Don't make a hearthstone reference. Don't do it. I'm gonna do it. Don't make the hearthstone say it. Dr. Boom fuck

1700
02:36:07,299 --> 02:36:13,489
Harry let's go back to the office. We need to report this to the chief

1701
02:36:14,209 --> 02:36:16,069
Yeah, you're right

1702
02:36:16,069 --> 02:36:21,379
The last thing I did is the only thing i've done

1703
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:28,450
You minus two suck minus two. You can't do two. Come on. Come on

1704
02:36:30,659 --> 02:36:34,340
All right, we get to report back to our stupid chief. We didn't even I didn't get to play the game

1705
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:38,659
That was just a ton of exposition

1706
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:50,920
steel hearts

1707
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:53,239
What

1708
02:36:53,239 --> 02:36:55,159
So let me get this straight

1709
02:36:55,159 --> 02:36:57,559
Not only do you

1710
02:36:57,559 --> 02:37:00,520
Not catch marv, but you let dark blue nab the ransom

1711
02:37:01,079 --> 02:37:05,559
You know, that's why everyone keeps making fun of us if we'd caught marv. We'd have gotten a huge reward

1712
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:10,200
So one of the world took you some her knee good palms lately

1713
02:37:12,610 --> 02:37:15,319
Hey, what?

1714
02:37:15,319 --> 02:37:17,319
bogey called in dark blue

1715
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:21,459
Bogey said he didn't want to hire someone who'd rather write poems than catch felons

1716
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:29,510
What?

1717
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:32,819
Well

1718
02:37:32,819 --> 02:37:36,420
These things happen good work everyone. Let's call it quits for today dismissed

1719
02:37:37,059 --> 02:37:45,219
We go to business now

1720
02:37:45,219 --> 02:37:46,739
He got away again

1721
02:37:46,739 --> 02:37:49,270
Let's go home. Gotta call trish gotta call trish

1722
02:37:49,909 --> 02:37:53,670
Dale, what are you doing after this?

1723
02:37:56,549 --> 02:37:59,459
See you tomorrow

1724
02:37:59,459 --> 02:38:11,729
the future gamer chair

1725
02:38:11,729 --> 02:38:14,420
Ring

1726
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:24,309
Who could be calling me this early in the morning? Hey, yeah, which me harry you awake

1727
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:27,909
Uh harry. Yeah morning. I'm up. What's going on?

1728
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:37,620
Showtime partner seems like there's a robo fight at the diamond chinese restaurant earnest wants us there as soon as possible

1729
02:38:38,719 --> 02:38:40,719
There you mean at the office?

1730
02:38:40,799 --> 02:38:42,799
No, he wants us to go straight to diamond

1731
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:48,040
That thing at bogey's yesterday has been bugging him. So he said he'd meet up with us there

1732
02:38:49,569 --> 02:38:51,569
Okay, got it diamond, right?

1733
02:38:51,729 --> 02:39:03,360
Coolio see you there. All right, so every resident sleeper. I see you one cent goes into the resident sleeper bank

1734
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:09,270
You know, that's you get that you know that right? Holy shit

1735
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:18,340
vertical gun

1736
02:39:18,340 --> 02:39:25,440
spider pod

1737
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:27,680
Anchor up him. No, no, i'm talking about you guys

1738
02:39:29,379 --> 02:39:31,139
I'm talking about you

1739
02:39:31,139 --> 02:39:39,299
Not me. Yeah, you're scared me. What happened? You woke up on your own

1740
02:39:40,690 --> 02:39:45,250
No, no, no harry called me. I've got work to do. Oh, and i'm so proud of you having woken up yourself at once

1741
02:39:46,389 --> 02:39:47,510
Oh, yeah, right

1742
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:51,809
Look, I have to go. I have to get to the diamond chinese restaurant. Oh damn it. That place is the best

1743
02:39:52,290 --> 02:39:55,010
The owner's a great chef. His name is dandodon. Tell him he said it

1744
02:39:55,649 --> 02:40:01,110
You can make anything ramen gyoza fried rice sour pork egg mani's pizza. Oh, it sounds delicious. I'm making my song

1745
02:40:02,309 --> 02:40:03,510
So where's him?

1746
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:05,879
You don't know just go north in the lilies

1747
02:40:05,879 --> 02:40:28,840
Sorry, I had times to that on the youtube video diamond. It's time for a fight. What happened here body on the ground

1748
02:40:29,239 --> 02:40:33,840
Okay, this has happened. It's terrible

1749
02:40:35,799 --> 02:40:39,399
Hey dale, you're here. We were too late seems poor guy. He was dead before we came here

1750
02:40:39,479 --> 02:40:42,290
Looks like mental shock must have killed him

1751
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:48,850
You could take real physical damage in a robo battle. If you die in the game, you die in real life

1752
02:40:49,329 --> 02:40:55,360
It takes a tremendous amount of stress to actually kill someone. I go to all the trouble of coming here in person

1753
02:40:55,360 --> 02:41:00,420
And this is what I get

1754
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:02,979
How many layers down was he in the dream?

1755
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:16,639
Right. No, i'm kidding. It was a joke. It was a joke. It was made. It was just deliberate farming

1756
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:19,430
If it's a deliberate farm, it's not a minus two

1757
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:22,229
It's an equals two

1758
02:41:22,229 --> 02:41:24,870
Equals two if it's a deliberate farm, don't you get that?

1759
02:41:25,430 --> 02:41:36,959
Cops are too busy to solve a murder. Apparently it was already too late when we arrived

1760
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:41,940
We're late things have gotten pretty bad here

1761
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:43,620
We have his cube

1762
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:51,680
Harry, what are you doing here? We got a call, but it came too late. Whatever happened. It was over before we got here

1763
02:41:52,709 --> 02:41:54,629
bounty hunters, ah

1764
02:41:54,629 --> 02:41:57,280
We got it from here. So why don't you all beat it?

1765
02:41:58,239 --> 02:42:04,600
Hey, what we've got a job to do and you bounty hunters aren't a part of it. Oh, it's that show

1766
02:42:05,239 --> 02:42:10,500
Sure, you show up for these cases, but for the small ones you don't even bother. That's easy for you to say

1767
02:42:11,569 --> 02:42:16,149
You bounty hunters are free to pick your missions, but we police have far more responsibility

1768
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:21,840
Where's the law then when's there? Where is it that regulates average folks needed? Huh?

1769
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:24,920
Can't be bothered. Is that it?

1770
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:30,469
You're not looking after the people who need you. Why do I even waste my time on a waster like you?

1771
02:42:31,270 --> 02:42:33,270
You're nothing like your sister

1772
02:42:33,350 --> 02:42:34,559
you

1773
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:36,959
Leave it harry. It's out of our hands now

1774
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:40,260
Harry, let's go. Come on dale

1775
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:44,579
Wait, you got a minute

1776
02:42:44,579 --> 02:42:48,659
Roy according to the witness the victim was fighting some sort of

1777
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:52,340
Autonomous robo

1778
02:42:52,340 --> 02:42:53,620
What did you say?

1779
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:57,090
And when it killed the victim it fled the scene

1780
02:42:57,649 --> 02:43:03,190
Sounds like trouble

1781
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:09,440
You really don't have a clue what's going on. Don't you an autonomous robo moves itself without having any commander dive into it

1782
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:13,590
It was designed for manual and repetitive labor. I've never heard of that one fights

1783
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:16,149
Oh

1784
02:43:16,149 --> 02:43:20,639
Which is why I have to ask you for a favor marcia

1785
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,010
I need your help

1786
02:43:23,010 --> 02:43:24,129
What me?

1787
02:43:24,129 --> 02:43:26,559
You know what i'm going to ask you

1788
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:31,280
I need to do a hack dive and read the victim's last thoughts

1789
02:43:32,610 --> 02:43:34,610
Skip the dialogue. Okay

1790
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:41,889
You call that asking respected fellow law enforcement for help say like you mean it

1791
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:44,450
What do you mean? No

1792
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:49,829
Thank god. No, fuck you. What it was one guy more than one

1793
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:51,840
What?

1794
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:53,280
Shut it harry

1795
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:55,040
I see your business is business

1796
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,120
If you think you can take it and give the cops a hand

1797
02:43:58,280 --> 02:44:00,120
I don't know earnest

1798
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:02,760
I haven't done a half dive in so long. I'm not even sure I still can

1799
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:07,459
I'm not sure i'm following this but I don't think marcia can help out here

1800
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:12,559
We need her to help though. There's no one else who can we can turn to

1801
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:17,879
I see we understand if you can't do it if you fail, please help us for a bad audition

1802
02:44:17,879 --> 02:44:19,879
This is we're a tv show that I want to be on

1803
02:44:22,639 --> 02:44:24,399
Imagine coming in

1804
02:44:24,479 --> 02:44:27,280
Through an audition and you have an audition for one character

1805
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
And you step in you can have these big sunglasses on you like no, no, no, no, no

1806
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:36,159
No, you don't have to read from me. You don't have to get anybody to read i'm gonna do all of them

1807
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:40,959
You do this

1808
02:44:40,959 --> 02:44:45,040
You is this impressive to an audition or is this like uh, this guy's kind of fucking weird

1809
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:50,719
I don't know if I want this guy in here. All right. Let me concentrate

1810
02:44:52,159 --> 02:44:54,079
What's a half dive?

1811
02:44:54,079 --> 02:44:58,479
Uh, I know they just told me what a half dive is when they go in and they can pull the data out

1812
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:01,299
What are they gonna do?

1813
02:45:01,299 --> 02:45:04,079
Just watch it's marcia's special power

1814
02:45:04,719 --> 02:45:08,479
Lord, I told you a while back marcia's had this special power since she was young

1815
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:13,670
Marcia can dive into a robo that's already been registered by eye contact

1816
02:45:14,229 --> 02:45:17,360
Doesn't mean she can control a pre-registered robo though

1817
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,569
However, she's able to read the commander's remaining cognition

1818
02:45:22,500 --> 02:45:25,540
So whatever the commander saw through his robo's eyes she sees

1819
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:33,379
You can even read that guy's last thoughts gruesome. I'm an unboxing youtuber. No

1820
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:39,750
No, all right, she's gonna half dive

1821
02:45:40,389 --> 02:45:46,399
Marcia, what's wrong? What happened?

1822
02:45:46,639 --> 02:45:48,639
Hey, i'll calm down. I'll explain later

1823
02:45:48,959 --> 02:45:51,010
How'd it go? What did you find?

1824
02:45:51,010 --> 02:45:55,040
It just cuts to like he's at the drive-through

1825
02:45:55,360 --> 02:45:57,040
It's weird boring shit

1826
02:45:57,040 --> 02:46:01,680
He's ordering like a number two or something and then he just comes in here and lies on the ground and dies

1827
02:46:02,639 --> 02:46:05,590
He wasn't fighting a custom robo

1828
02:46:06,069 --> 02:46:09,479
What do you mean?

1829
02:46:09,479 --> 02:46:13,000
Didn't look like a robo. I've never seen anything like it. It was like a living thing

1830
02:46:13,799 --> 02:46:17,000
That's ridiculous no living thing can enter the hall as am

1831
02:46:17,559 --> 02:46:20,159
You're right. It's just not possible

1832
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:23,520
Everything about it is different. It doesn't move like a robot doesn't even look like one

1833
02:46:25,989 --> 02:46:27,590
You see what it was?

1834
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:30,709
Only vaguely. It's just i've heard enough. There's no way that could happen

1835
02:46:32,209 --> 02:46:33,729
Shut up broy

1836
02:46:33,729 --> 02:46:35,489
Marcia what just what?

1837
02:46:35,489 --> 02:46:37,700
I've never felt such

1838
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:39,700
overwhelming power

1839
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:49,670
Come with us to hq. We'll want to make a composite sketch of the robo you saw

1840
02:46:50,309 --> 02:46:56,420
Hey, whoa there look at her marcy is in bad shape the stress of the half-dive is getting to her

1841
02:46:57,139 --> 02:47:00,149
I see what she has to go through every time she does this

1842
02:47:00,790 --> 02:47:05,360
We're sorry about that. But as a citizen she must comply with any and all police squad orders

1843
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,139
unlimited power

1844
02:47:09,139 --> 02:47:12,659
Why we're asking for the cooperation not their resentment be civil

1845
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:16,149
Forgive me

1846
02:47:16,149 --> 02:47:18,709
As if look at you barking like a dog

1847
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:22,549
Still taking orders from my own sister loser

1848
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:26,600
Harry you're out of line

1849
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:29,360
Thank you for your hard work marcia

1850
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:32,819
You must understand that this is extremely important and we desperately need your help

1851
02:47:33,379 --> 02:47:36,739
I know you're feeling a little weak, but we won't ask you to do anything strenuous. I promise

1852
02:47:37,700 --> 02:47:40,739
Please come with us to hq and tell us more about your power

1853
02:47:41,799 --> 02:47:45,719
Please hq marcia. Are you all right? You can rest up if you're not feeling up to it. Yeah

1854
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:49,639
Just don't over exert. We'll be all right. We got you back. Bye

1855
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:57,399
Hey harry, let's go

1856
02:47:57,399 --> 02:47:59,639
This is a visual novel people happy

1857
02:47:59,639 --> 02:48:07,120
Marcia

1858
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:16,399
It kind of is yeah, but okay, it's a visual novel with really fun shit sprinkled sometimes in the game

1859
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:26,659
It still has my attention. It's taking marcia so long. I wonder if she's okay

1860
02:48:27,459 --> 02:48:31,090
Marcia will be fine. She's got a strong will she's not like you

1861
02:48:31,809 --> 02:48:37,879
It's not nice marcia was so willing to help those cops. I mean she hardly argued at all

1862
02:48:38,979 --> 02:48:42,340
Hey harry, what's so special about a half-time? Why can't anyone else do it?

1863
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:47,379
I don't know. It's a rare talent. I've never met anyone who could do it

1864
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:52,120
Really, but there might be others. I've never even heard about a half-dive before now

1865
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:59,829
Well, according to my sister marcia is the only commander. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can do a half-dive. Whoa, that's insane

1866
02:49:00,389 --> 02:49:05,909
Well, she's something all right, but it doesn't sound all that great. Her power makes her extremely sensitive emotionally speaking. I mean

1867
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:11,350
Oh, so for example, you ever have times when there's something on your mind

1868
02:49:12,149 --> 02:49:14,709
Would you get worried?

1869
02:49:14,709 --> 02:49:16,709
well in marcia's case

1870
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:20,360
Take those worries and multiply them by a hundred

1871
02:49:21,350 --> 02:49:23,430
She gets so stressed out. She just freezes

1872
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:32,370
That's pretty sensitive

1873
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:35,329
Uh, yeah, she's been like that since she was a child. Okay

1874
02:49:36,129 --> 02:49:40,530
That's why she seems so distant. She needs the distance to keep from getting hurt by people

1875
02:49:41,090 --> 02:49:42,819
See it's like this

1876
02:49:42,819 --> 02:49:44,819
I see his big brother always used to protect her

1877
02:49:45,299 --> 02:49:48,309
It's rough being that sensitive and losing both your parents and your brother

1878
02:49:49,090 --> 02:49:52,850
Yeah, she really sort of hit rock bottom. It took a lot of work for marcia to get to where she is now

1879
02:49:53,409 --> 02:49:56,100
Uh, hey, that's enough out of you

1880
02:49:56,260 --> 02:50:03,350
I even catch you guys treating her differently because of this. I'll whoop you both good. It's the phone. Maybe it's marcia

1881
02:50:04,819 --> 02:50:06,340
How sensitive is she?

1882
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:08,209
I don't know

1883
02:50:08,209 --> 02:50:10,209
Barry I got I think she's pretty sensitive

1884
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:20,399
Jill hearts your squeal you squeal will deal is his artist. Uh bogey. Sorry about yesterday

1885
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:25,110
Yeah, I knew he was a wanted man. I forgot my robo. That's why I couldn't catch him on the spot

1886
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:30,739
What oh I get it you gave dark blue the job yesterday. So now you're handing one down to us today

1887
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:33,270
Thank you

1888
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:36,549
You're absolutely right. I'm a very loyal customer. Your cafe has great atmosphere

1889
02:50:37,430 --> 02:50:39,430
Oh, you're starting a poetry slam night

1890
02:50:40,069 --> 02:50:42,069
What makes you think that I write poetry?

1891
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:44,629
You saw that

1892
02:50:44,629 --> 02:50:54,020
Well outside the boy's over right now. All right, we've got work get over to bogeys pronto

1893
02:50:54,819 --> 02:50:57,139
Tutorial this is not this tutorial. It's been three hours

1894
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:00,479
Seems like there's some guy making a killing on battle wagers

1895
02:51:00,799 --> 02:51:05,090
Oh, he said the guy's incredibly strong and he's gonna put bogey out of business if this keeps up

1896
02:51:05,569 --> 02:51:12,120
Oh, you're not coming earnest. I don't think so. I feel like a bad luck right now

1897
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:16,879
I got some light filing to do. Yeah, sure. Hurry up

1898
02:51:20,049 --> 02:51:35,989
Oh go go go go go go go go bogeys cafe. Here it is time for a fight

1899
02:51:38,579 --> 02:51:40,579
Thanks for the call at your service

1900
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:44,260
Well, hello

1901
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:52,790
I've been waiting for you harry and you too dale. Oh great. Not you. Here you go. Let's fight

1902
02:51:53,350 --> 02:51:56,469
I'll give you the tldr

1903
02:51:56,549 --> 02:51:58,850
bad guy versus good guy

1904
02:51:58,930 --> 02:52:00,930
Trying to teach why is his hands up?

1905
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:08,500
We would have resolved the situation right away, but bogey insisted that we gave you still hearts fellow a fair shot

1906
02:52:09,059 --> 02:52:13,879
In fair spare of course, we're waiting till you screw up. There's fair bogey called us. Not you. This is our job

1907
02:52:13,959 --> 02:52:17,479
Oh, please harry. Are you even listening? We're mercenaries. The job goes to the fastest team

1908
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:22,799
We're a generous group we dark blue mercenaries. We'll fight. How about two on two?

1909
02:52:36,129 --> 02:52:43,430
Nope, did you hear all those breaths?

1910
02:52:44,709 --> 02:52:46,709
I want to see the new things we got

1911
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:50,549
Vertical this is so cool. There's 13 pages of guns

1912
02:52:51,590 --> 02:53:02,069
But unfortunately, there's 13 pages of dialogue as well between every single scene. I want to try vertical

1913
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:11,040
Keep standard. I like the standard. I've got a new one of these two tonight

1914
02:53:12,389 --> 02:53:17,909
Good spider remains in place when deployed and homes in on a target that approaches

1915
02:53:18,709 --> 02:53:19,670
That's right

1916
02:53:19,670 --> 02:53:22,709
What is a vertical two rounds straight?

1917
02:53:23,430 --> 02:53:26,639
And two more vertical

1918
02:53:26,639 --> 02:53:28,079
Oh, okay

1919
02:53:28,079 --> 02:53:31,840
You can clear walls the vertical one's clear walls. All right, that's awesome

1920
02:53:32,399 --> 02:53:37,840
What does the feather do decreases jump speed makes you less vulnerable to attacks when landing?

1921
02:53:38,399 --> 02:53:43,239
Also makes to help make sharp turns on the ground. Let's try this

1922
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:54,770
It looks pretty cool

1923
02:53:54,770 --> 02:54:03,090
All right, let's do it

1924
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:05,090
Six seconds. What?

1925
02:54:05,090 --> 02:54:06,850
I've been mashing

1926
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:15,750
Get over there get over. Oh, whoa

1927
02:54:19,139 --> 02:54:20,659
Wait, the spider

1928
02:54:20,659 --> 02:54:23,059
Spider is weird

1929
02:54:23,059 --> 02:54:28,979
Do a live commentary. I'm almost dead

1930
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:31,860
How am I almost dead? No

1931
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:43,569
Get out of the tutorial. I'm trying

1932
02:54:47,639 --> 02:54:48,680
we're like

1933
02:54:48,680 --> 02:54:49,799
like

1934
02:54:49,799 --> 02:54:52,600
Eight tenths of the game's dialogue is not much I can do

1935
02:54:53,319 --> 02:55:00,159
Where's my partner? What is he doing over there?

1936
02:55:01,459 --> 02:55:07,520
I'm gonna lose

1937
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:08,639
We're dead

1938
02:55:08,639 --> 02:55:20,799
I think we're supposed to lose

1939
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:25,170
Scripted

1940
02:55:25,170 --> 02:55:29,329
Celebrating how is it for you? Did you learn anything other than the meaning of shame scripted?

1941
02:55:29,889 --> 02:55:36,129
Let me tell you a little bit about two on two and a two on two battle

1942
02:55:36,129 --> 02:55:38,209
You partner's gunshots and charges won't hurt you

1943
02:55:39,250 --> 02:55:41,250
Still take damage if you get fight apart. Yeah

1944
02:55:42,049 --> 02:55:44,049
I got it. Will we get a second chance?

1945
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:46,639
Full throttle, let's go

1946
02:55:49,090 --> 02:55:50,770
Sorry, he's new

1947
02:55:50,770 --> 02:55:53,780
All right. I want to go back to what I was using before

1948
02:55:54,260 --> 02:56:08,319
Tim and ip get the spider off. I don't like it that much cockroach is the way to go feather get rid of it long thrust

1949
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,120
That's my guy right here

1950
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:14,450
Wait, I got I have a new robot

1951
02:56:17,399 --> 02:56:23,079
I'm sorry. There's so much talking in this game that I forgot that like I forgot some stuff that I actually unlocked

1952
02:56:23,719 --> 02:56:29,559
The you unlocked this thing is one sentence squished in between like 300 sentences

1953
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:37,299
I think red

1954
02:56:37,299 --> 02:56:43,719
red

1955
02:56:43,719 --> 02:56:47,489
Uh, i'm gonna keep this one. Yeah, let's try him

1956
02:56:58,739 --> 02:57:07,670
Bam, what the fuck? Why am I so slow?

1957
02:57:19,090 --> 02:57:20,930
Those cockroaches out

1958
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:35,030
Cockroaches cockroaches cockroaches. You gotta bully this guy back here

1959
02:57:35,670 --> 02:57:43,409
Holy bully bully bully good

1960
02:57:43,409 --> 02:57:46,639
All right, this guy's toast

1961
02:57:46,639 --> 02:57:53,440
Yeah roaches the best for sure knock him down. I'll get him with this

1962
02:57:54,239 --> 02:57:56,930
I'll come down knock him down get a knock down

1963
02:57:57,409 --> 02:58:07,649
Cockroaches are by far the best item in the game

1964
02:58:08,209 --> 02:58:17,879
Let's get back to the story already

1965
02:58:19,909 --> 02:58:21,110
I

1966
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:22,790
Got two more puns

1967
02:58:22,790 --> 02:58:29,090
Oh exhilarating how best to measure one skill than to permit him to have victory. Did you learn something?

1968
02:58:29,649 --> 02:58:31,409
Certainly. Hope you did

1969
02:58:31,409 --> 02:58:34,159
Why don't we talk about my story?

1970
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:36,719
You see when I was a young boy

1971
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:41,760
My father left me and my mother left too and then I decided I was good

1972
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:52,469
Thank god. I'm gonna go off script. No, i'm going i'm staying on script but quick

1973
02:58:54,739 --> 02:58:57,940
We beat him can't even own up to it. Anyway, that was a nice little waste of our time

1974
02:58:57,940 --> 02:58:59,620
Now we'd better get back to work

1975
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:03,010
Okay bogey, where can we find this guy you're after?

1976
02:59:03,809 --> 02:59:05,409
How's that door?

1977
02:59:05,409 --> 02:59:07,569
oh

1978
02:59:07,569 --> 02:59:12,770
That's a false wall. There's a door hidden there. We hold robo battles in the back room

1979
02:59:13,329 --> 02:59:15,829
This guy's been winning every match and i'm losing money

1980
02:59:19,569 --> 02:59:22,129
Stop pretending to read don't read stop pretending

1981
02:59:23,889 --> 02:59:26,149
Okay

1982
02:59:26,149 --> 02:59:29,989
Well, I mean what is illegal? Anyway, I mean it's such a vague term, you know

1983
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:33,840
I get it. That's why you called us instead of the cops. You didn't want to get busted

1984
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,159
It is 3d movie maker. This is the same exact

1985
02:59:37,860 --> 02:59:43,319
Restaurant and in fact, it's like the same actor behind the counter. This is the same shot

1986
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:47,860
Maybe when you're older, you'll understand

1987
02:59:48,020 --> 02:59:50,200
Listen, don't tell anyone. Okay

1988
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:54,680
Harry, all right, what's in it for me?

1989
02:59:54,760 --> 02:59:58,600
I mean I could be quiet about it or I can be real noisy

1990
02:59:59,319 --> 03:00:01,719
Hey, hey, don't be that way. You'll get paid. Well, if you pull this off

1991
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:06,129
All right, keep your mouth shut dale. Let's go. I appreciate your discretion

1992
03:00:06,690 --> 03:00:17,219
Is that for all

1993
03:00:17,219 --> 03:00:21,399
We should chat up the crowd for some info before we sign up

1994
03:00:27,620 --> 03:00:29,620
Left flank bomb. What else do I get?

1995
03:00:30,399 --> 03:00:31,920
ain't pod f

1996
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:35,219
pretty cool

1997
03:00:35,219 --> 03:00:38,450
Let's chat up crowd

1998
03:00:38,450 --> 03:00:43,409
Mentoring the next tournament. I'll probably bump into one of you depending on how they mix up the entries

1999
03:00:44,469 --> 03:00:46,870
Pardon me, but are you the one who's been winning all the matches?

2000
03:00:47,750 --> 03:00:51,030
You got the wrong person buddy. You want to talk to shiner?

2001
03:00:51,829 --> 03:00:54,549
He's in the waiting room right now with the other combatants. Mm-hmm

2002
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:57,190
Okay, I wonder who he is

2003
03:00:57,190 --> 03:01:02,709
Okay, it has probably has to be you. No, it could be you. It's probably you one of you two back here

2004
03:01:02,709 --> 03:01:04,229
No, it can't be you

2005
03:01:04,229 --> 03:01:08,950
Can't be the only person with an actual video game model that was made. You're not the guy

2006
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:14,579
No, I have the phantom of the opera thing in front of my face

2007
03:01:16,389 --> 03:01:19,479
No, that's not him

2008
03:01:19,479 --> 03:01:23,159
I keep betting on the underdog, but shiner keeps beating them. I'll never break even now

2009
03:01:23,719 --> 03:01:29,430
The guy over there hasn't placed one bet. He's just been sitting there watching the battles

2010
03:01:30,069 --> 03:01:33,090
What's he even doing here?

2011
03:01:33,090 --> 03:01:36,479
Wait, is this not the guy?

2012
03:01:36,479 --> 03:01:40,639
Shiner's been winning all the matches. So it's no fun to bet. That's why it's slow today

2013
03:01:43,399 --> 03:01:46,610
Hmm

2014
03:01:46,610 --> 03:01:48,610
You might as well just write

2015
03:01:48,670 --> 03:01:52,850
Mua h mua mua ha ha ha

2016
03:01:53,569 --> 03:02:04,440
Today just ain't my day. I'll barely break even if I bet on shiner and he's the odds-on favorite

2017
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:07,799
But nobody's gonna beat shiners. There's no point in betting on anybody else

2018
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:17,510
Is this shiner? You must be harry and dale

2019
03:02:18,309 --> 03:02:21,190
Mogi told me you'd be coming. Are you ready to fight?

2020
03:02:21,829 --> 03:02:28,069
No, not yet. He needs some time to talk to all the creeps around here. I understand i'll be ready when you are ready

2021
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:31,280
I talked to everybody already

2022
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:36,959
Day in my day did I talk?

2023
03:02:36,959 --> 03:02:39,600
Sorry guys, but i'm gonna take shiner down and claim the prize

2024
03:02:40,239 --> 03:02:44,600
Who did I not talk to?

2025
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:54,920
If you enter the battle tournament, you can win big and get badly beat though

2026
03:02:58,420 --> 03:03:01,409
Day in my day

2027
03:03:01,409 --> 03:03:03,409
Shiner's been winning all the games. Where is he?

2028
03:03:03,969 --> 03:03:12,819
You must be harry

2029
03:03:12,819 --> 03:03:18,389
We're hosting a battle tournament with 16 commanders. I was just making the entry list for the next tournament

2030
03:03:19,430 --> 03:03:21,270
16 I hope we get to play

2031
03:03:21,270 --> 03:03:23,969
I'm determining your entry position now. Hold on a moment

2032
03:03:29,479 --> 03:03:31,489
16

2033
03:03:31,489 --> 03:03:34,290
All the way at the back of the mario kart line, right? Uh-huh

2034
03:03:34,930 --> 03:03:42,069
Dale is number nine which one's been winning all the matches

2035
03:03:42,870 --> 03:03:44,870
Well, that will be shiner entry number one

2036
03:03:45,190 --> 03:03:48,200
He's number one. I'm number 16

2037
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:50,280
And dale is number nine

2038
03:03:50,719 --> 03:03:54,159
Dang according to this he we won't get a chance to face him until finals

2039
03:03:55,649 --> 03:03:58,469
That means that dale and I have to fight each other in the semi-finals

2040
03:03:59,329 --> 03:04:04,690
What season two of every anime ever the season fucking the entire season is this whole thing

2041
03:04:05,250 --> 03:04:08,549
You can skip season two of every anime that's ever existed

2042
03:04:09,350 --> 03:04:11,879
What?

2043
03:04:11,879 --> 03:04:17,540
Can't we change?

2044
03:04:17,540 --> 03:04:21,139
Sorry, everything's done by computers. It's totally random. I can't change your number for you

2045
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:27,590
I start messing around with the numbers. The guests will think i'm fixing the matches

2046
03:04:29,139 --> 03:04:33,459
I thought bogey set this up for us. Oh man. Well, I guess we'll just have to win your tournament

2047
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:37,559
Please wait here. I'll call you when it's your turn. Please call me when it's my turn

2048
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:50,760
Is it my turn?

2049
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:54,120
We can't leave

2050
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:56,120
Uh, excuse me. Is it my turn yet?

2051
03:04:57,190 --> 03:05:01,270
Are you ready to go? Make sure you check the parts generator. I'm ready. You said you were gonna call me

2052
03:05:01,829 --> 03:05:09,799
First battle will be dale versus paulie

2053
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:15,040
That's right. It's me paulie your original character

2054
03:05:16,659 --> 03:05:19,940
You thought you could say make paul and then just delete him no

2055
03:05:21,219 --> 03:05:25,139
I exist

2056
03:05:25,139 --> 03:05:28,739
Go for a deal. Don't worry. I've got tons of advice to get you through this

2057
03:05:33,909 --> 03:05:37,190
Tons of advice. That's not fair. That should be disqualified. I win by default

2058
03:05:37,750 --> 03:05:40,049
Hey chill. I'm not fighting. I'm just watching

2059
03:05:40,690 --> 03:05:42,690
Hang on. Aren't you a cop?

2060
03:05:42,770 --> 03:05:46,920
What's an upright member of the police squad like yourself doing in a place like this?

2061
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:52,549
Not so loud. How could you tell?

2062
03:05:52,549 --> 03:05:54,549
You know, he's wearing his uniform

2063
03:05:55,329 --> 03:05:58,610
Wait a minute. You're those guys who busted the lab burglary

2064
03:05:59,489 --> 03:06:01,909
You must have recognized my distinctive features

2065
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:07,989
More like your distinctive uniform pops all look the same to me

2066
03:06:09,590 --> 03:06:12,950
So wait, that means that you're one of those guys the burglars beat up

2067
03:06:13,969 --> 03:06:15,969
And you're one of those guys who shuts up

2068
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:20,600
Insurance didn't cover any of my bills. So i'm trying to make some scratch on the side. Okay

2069
03:06:23,299 --> 03:06:27,780
Listen guys, i'm sure you've got lots to catch up on but we're trying to hold a tournament here

2070
03:06:28,739 --> 03:06:31,059
I'm gonna do better this time this time i'm in it for the money

2071
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:33,809
Yeah, whatever you say

2072
03:06:33,809 --> 03:06:36,399
Okay, my advice for you is to beat this guy up but good

2073
03:06:40,559 --> 03:06:42,559
enough dialogue i'm trying

2074
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:46,159
This guy's using a strike vanisher model. Let me explain

2075
03:06:46,959 --> 03:06:49,920
Like the shining fighter the strike manager's model

2076
03:06:50,479 --> 03:06:54,399
The bullies are well balanced but the biggest difference is that it has a stealth function

2077
03:06:55,360 --> 03:07:00,159
Stealth function if you do an air dash this function will make your robo disappear

2078
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:06,079
Dodging incoming gunfire compared to a shining fighter model it moves slowly

2079
03:07:06,719 --> 03:07:12,600
I just i'm i'm like yawning now you guys made me yawn because you said yawn

2080
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:22,870
Wouldn't everybody if you're going to use a strike manager take advantage of its stealth ability to dodge got it

2081
03:07:24,709 --> 03:07:29,479
Why?

2082
03:07:29,479 --> 03:07:34,440
And one more thing is a holoseum called a diamond cell that the police squad use

2083
03:07:35,079 --> 03:07:41,399
There's a magma zone in that holoseum. So be careful. Oh, yeah, it's that red stuff. Don't step in it

2084
03:07:41,879 --> 03:07:45,239
How's that irony though? You're not a crook, but you're fighting a cop comedy

2085
03:07:47,559 --> 03:07:52,020
Harry can I play the game now? Oh, yes. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Yes

2086
03:07:52,739 --> 03:07:56,870
The gatling guns took it up

2087
03:07:56,870 --> 03:08:03,780
I like the ape

2088
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:07,270
So much stuff. I wish I would just be able to play and unlock

2089
03:08:07,909 --> 03:08:13,110
All right faint f stops in front of its target and to play two at one time

2090
03:08:13,829 --> 03:08:16,229
Can I get another one?

2091
03:08:16,229 --> 03:08:30,000
I mean, you kind of have to try everything once right? I did vertical. I didn't like it. Let's try this

2092
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:40,180
All right, don't stand in the lava mash

2093
03:08:54,719 --> 03:08:55,840
Ooh

2094
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:57,440
These are kind of cool. I like these

2095
03:08:57,440 --> 03:09:19,520
What the fuck was that? He just lagged. Oh, that's the stealth feature. Okay

2096
03:09:20,239 --> 03:09:32,100
It's a shitty connection. I don't even know what that does. I don't lose don't lose in the tournament

2097
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:49,840
Play smart

2098
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:50,959
shit

2099
03:09:50,959 --> 03:09:55,440
You're gonna lose in the first round. I'm not gonna lose in the first round

2100
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:03,799
If I lose in this round, I will get 25 000 subs

2101
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:29,319
I'm good. Don't have to do that access to the javelin. I couldn't have drawn an easier first match so much for paying my bills

2102
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:32,600
Skills like those. How do you ever get to be a cop?

2103
03:10:35,079 --> 03:10:37,079
That's like pretty sad, isn't it?

2104
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:40,180
Why shake hand this guy a hundred dollars?

2105
03:10:40,659 --> 03:10:42,020
Right

2106
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:43,860
That's I feel bad

2107
03:10:43,860 --> 03:10:46,680
All right next fight

2108
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:51,219
That's a new uh, that's a new

2109
03:10:51,280 --> 03:11:01,620
Robotype

2110
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:05,559
Javelin strike vanisher model. Oh, this is one of the stealth ones. I'll try it

2111
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:10,209
I'm like the criminal one

2112
03:11:10,209 --> 03:11:13,729
All right javelin and yeah yellow

2113
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:19,860
Hmm

2114
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:21,299
I'll try to get this to work

2115
03:11:21,299 --> 03:11:25,079
Remember, what do I do with my channel points?

2116
03:11:25,719 --> 03:11:27,719
Um, you just hold on to them forever

2117
03:11:28,799 --> 03:11:31,670
Pretty much what's gonna happen?

2118
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:33,270
Uh cockroach

2119
03:11:33,270 --> 03:11:44,549
Holy shit, I can do that

2120
03:11:44,549 --> 03:11:48,129
All right, let's go

2121
03:11:48,129 --> 03:11:50,229
round two

2122
03:11:50,229 --> 03:11:52,709
No, not this shit. Not this just don't do this

2123
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:57,190
This is like the only thing you guys use channel points for is the one thing that I haven't disabled

2124
03:11:57,829 --> 03:11:59,829
And that's the purple text that takes over

2125
03:11:59,909 --> 03:12:04,709
It's the only thing that you can do besides the emote changes and it's 1200 and I know at least

2126
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:09,750
Two to three thousand of you have like 20 million channel points. So this could go on forever

2127
03:12:10,549 --> 03:12:12,549
You could this some of you guys that this is

2128
03:12:13,110 --> 03:12:15,190
Like a nickel to a lot of you guys

2129
03:12:15,750 --> 03:12:20,790
All right. I won my first match too shine. I won his match

2130
03:12:21,510 --> 03:12:24,260
We're going to because this is dad again

2131
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:26,639
Have a clean fight

2132
03:12:26,639 --> 03:12:29,920
Isn't that the one guy who got in a fight with his wife? Yes, it is

2133
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:33,569
What are you doing in this place?

2134
03:12:33,569 --> 03:12:36,930
Well, it's like this my wife handles all our money and I don't get much allowance

2135
03:12:37,010 --> 03:12:39,409
So I figured this would be a good way to make some extra money

2136
03:12:40,049 --> 03:12:42,149
You want allowance?

2137
03:12:42,149 --> 03:12:47,920
You better believe it by the way, I have a favor to ask could you take it easy on me, you know

2138
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:50,229
So I could win

2139
03:12:50,229 --> 03:12:52,600
No, I want to win

2140
03:12:52,600 --> 03:13:04,079
Highlight my message. I have to delete channel points. I think where you're going to fire when you use that pot

2141
03:13:04,079 --> 03:13:07,440
You can do all kinds of things with the pod pod pod pod pod pod. Yeah

2142
03:13:08,399 --> 03:13:11,159
Uh-huh. Thank you deal

2143
03:13:11,639 --> 03:13:14,129
Wake up i'll say it again. Oh no

2144
03:13:15,010 --> 03:13:18,899
We just made him do it again

2145
03:13:18,899 --> 03:13:23,319
Remember you lost the chat hours ago

2146
03:13:23,719 --> 03:13:24,840
Did I?

2147
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:31,479
Did I lose the chat hours ago? I feel like I didn't

2148
03:13:31,959 --> 03:13:33,799
I don't think we've been talking

2149
03:13:33,799 --> 03:13:37,969
We've been having a conversation. We've been hanging out

2150
03:13:38,930 --> 03:13:46,040
That's a cool type. Was it a super type? That's a that's a dr. Robotnik type. I want that one

2151
03:13:46,520 --> 03:14:01,670
Let's try the javelin beanbag sonic robot. Yeah

2152
03:14:02,389 --> 03:14:05,680
This is a cool area too. All right. Why am I not being able to get this?

2153
03:14:06,399 --> 03:14:08,239
Just draw here. All right, go

2154
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:14,129
Here we go

2155
03:14:14,129 --> 03:14:16,370
And this thing actually works pretty well when it's a slow

2156
03:14:17,409 --> 03:14:26,079
Holy shit, this is awesome

2157
03:14:26,079 --> 03:14:28,079
vertical with the sky

2158
03:14:45,639 --> 03:14:54,610
Oh just get him rebirth. Hey. Hey, what speaking of rebirth?

2159
03:14:56,209 --> 03:15:00,290
Wasn't there a new binding of isaac thing that's supposed to come out like two years ago? What happened to that?

2160
03:15:01,090 --> 03:15:03,799
That out

2161
03:15:03,799 --> 03:15:16,469
Go get him roaches go

2162
03:15:16,469 --> 03:15:18,469
Yeah, like redemption or something or

2163
03:15:19,350 --> 03:15:21,350
Repentance or something whatever it's called

2164
03:15:28,739 --> 03:15:33,750
Yeah, come on. I'm gonna get in closer to drop these roaches

2165
03:15:46,370 --> 03:15:57,909
Get him roaches. You can do that three times. Holy shit

2166
03:15:58,709 --> 03:16:06,309
This character is really good

2167
03:16:06,309 --> 03:16:10,209
We need to play x-men origins

2168
03:16:10,209 --> 03:16:17,760
What do you mean watch the movie on stream because I can't do that left five-way gunner?

2169
03:16:18,239 --> 03:16:32,739
I'll never afford that lovely toupee now. What was the name of that robo game that I played? Wait, what'd you say?

2170
03:16:33,540 --> 03:16:38,819
What was the name of that robo game that germa played a while ago? That was almost like this. It's called gotcha force

2171
03:16:39,940 --> 03:16:43,809
And it is incredible

2172
03:16:43,809 --> 03:16:46,930
That is a fantastic video game. I love every second of it

2173
03:16:52,559 --> 03:16:54,420
Semi-finals are going here. We go

2174
03:16:54,420 --> 03:17:00,819
This is worse than that

2175
03:17:00,819 --> 03:17:05,620
Are you implying that gotcha force is not a good game because if you are then that is a permaban on this channel

2176
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:11,700
And uh-huh permaban. It's gonna be like a minute. No, no, no, no like you are removed from the you are removed forever

2177
03:17:12,340 --> 03:17:16,739
Yeah, I will I will make sure that you are banned permanently and you don't get to chat ever again

2178
03:17:19,170 --> 03:17:22,850
Like oh, yeah, that's really funny. Like i'm gonna ban you for like a minute like we no, no, no, absolutely not

2179
03:17:23,090 --> 03:17:27,010
You make you say gotcha force sucks. Be careful playing with fire

2180
03:17:34,120 --> 03:17:41,959
Everyone's gonna be banned the higher you jump the more vulnerable you become same goes for an air dash

2181
03:17:44,850 --> 03:17:51,959
Me versus you

2182
03:17:51,959 --> 03:17:54,040
I didn't watch that stream with a happy face

2183
03:17:56,440 --> 03:17:58,920
Edit your comment and make that a sad face

2184
03:17:59,719 --> 03:18:00,760
or

2185
03:18:00,760 --> 03:18:03,379
You know what that is

2186
03:18:03,379 --> 03:18:06,840
I'm gonna keep this. I like this. Wait, what was the new thing I got?

2187
03:18:07,559 --> 03:18:12,739
Five ways something right?

2188
03:18:12,739 --> 03:18:18,340
Fires five rounds that spread to the left side the rounds turn in the opposite direction when fired from the air

2189
03:18:19,059 --> 03:18:20,520
That's right

2190
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:31,079
Give me mod privilege and i'll edit it

2191
03:18:31,399 --> 03:18:33,399
Yeah, i'll give you a mod dude

2192
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:36,770
Fucking hell freezes over

2193
03:18:36,770 --> 03:18:46,500
I like this one. Holy shit. This one's perfect. This is the spreader from contra three

2194
03:18:49,319 --> 03:18:53,879
Most satisfying weapon in any video game is the spreader from contra three and it's in this game

2195
03:18:54,600 --> 03:19:14,500
Get him roaches get him. He's got roaches, too

2196
03:19:15,139 --> 03:19:26,360
It's got good spread, but it doesn't do very much damage

2197
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:37,479
I get a hit

2198
03:19:37,479 --> 03:19:42,260
I have to be on that stupid thing

2199
03:19:42,260 --> 03:19:52,629
Hurry and get him. I just hit myself with my own bomb

2200
03:19:56,790 --> 03:19:59,270
Shit. Oh, no, he's just styling on me now

2201
03:19:59,909 --> 03:20:22,610
the health

2202
03:20:22,610 --> 03:20:24,610
Lost to harry pepe low

2203
03:20:28,959 --> 03:20:35,250
That's my it's a new guy I haven't played with him do I lose the tournament

2204
03:20:40,229 --> 03:20:43,270
You're still a novice. So i'll give you just a bit more advice the higher you jump

2205
03:20:43,350 --> 03:20:45,350
Wait, is he gonna give you another chance?

2206
03:20:47,489 --> 03:20:50,770
So I can't lose the tournament. Let's go at it for real this time

2207
03:20:51,329 --> 03:20:58,159
Yeah, the game is save scumming for me

2208
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:02,520
All right. I know I I know his little bullshit watch this

2209
03:21:04,639 --> 03:21:06,790
back to the ape

2210
03:21:06,790 --> 03:21:08,469
green hulk ape

2211
03:21:08,469 --> 03:21:14,440
Back to vertical. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. Yeah

2212
03:21:17,569 --> 03:21:19,780
flank h

2213
03:21:19,780 --> 03:21:22,100
Cockroach is all right, but I think I want speed d for this

2214
03:21:22,819 --> 03:21:35,299
Guys, he's pretending to know the strategy of the game

2215
03:21:35,940 --> 03:21:39,780
Do you hear the confidence in his voice?

2216
03:21:39,940 --> 03:21:50,500
That was my mistake. He's not using this

2217
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:10,399
Why did mine hit the wall and he's been over the wall and i'm speed

2218
03:22:20,899 --> 03:22:21,860
Close

2219
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:30,950
I didn't say shb

2220
03:22:41,620 --> 03:22:48,079
Where's the juggler

2221
03:22:48,079 --> 03:23:03,569
pirate

2222
03:23:03,569 --> 03:23:06,450
Eat that shb. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2223
03:23:08,819 --> 03:23:10,579
Heard that one before

2224
03:23:10,579 --> 03:23:19,680
I win

2225
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:34,770
Monkey always wins the boost pod and we're gonna fight the guy i'm the fan of the opera mask

2226
03:23:35,090 --> 03:23:38,549
I think you'd be so good. I've trained you well

2227
03:23:39,190 --> 03:23:43,079
I didn't feel like going full strength on you. Heh

2228
03:23:43,799 --> 03:23:47,250
You're our man. Make sure you don't screw up because this is an important job

2229
03:23:47,729 --> 03:23:49,729
All right is shiner gonna let me win

2230
03:23:49,969 --> 03:23:54,559
if I lose

2231
03:23:54,559 --> 03:24:01,350
boost pod time for the finals

2232
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:19,270
That's shiner. It's time for the finals. You have between shiner and our newest star. I've never seen this guy before

2233
03:24:22,180 --> 03:24:26,260
Doesn't matter what you do. Everyone will bet on me. I'm the best

2234
03:24:26,979 --> 03:24:30,120
No one wants to throw away his money on an obvious loser

2235
03:24:31,270 --> 03:24:35,989
You know what? I don't care about all these losers make this place a profit

2236
03:24:36,629 --> 03:24:39,000
As long as i'm to waluigi

2237
03:24:41,299 --> 03:24:44,100
That's not even close to waluigi

2238
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:52,149
Even close

2239
03:24:52,149 --> 03:24:57,829
As long as i'm making money and the masses go weak at the knees when they see me i'm happy

2240
03:25:00,239 --> 03:25:03,430
That's such a stretch

2241
03:25:03,430 --> 03:25:05,989
So tell me are you jealous of my skill?

2242
03:25:06,719 --> 03:25:07,920
Do you

2243
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:09,120
Hate me

2244
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:11,190
Hey, what do you say?

2245
03:25:11,190 --> 03:25:14,870
All right. What was that? We were busy polishing our robo cubes. What is wrong with this guy?

2246
03:25:16,319 --> 03:25:18,319
Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2247
03:25:19,059 --> 03:25:21,860
It's a laugh. I'm the one who's gonna eat him alive

2248
03:25:22,659 --> 03:25:26,100
I'll show you the power of breaker my lightning sky robo

2249
03:25:27,329 --> 03:25:31,889
Lightning sky. I don't know what that is. Can you explain to me what the lightning's lightning sky model is?

2250
03:25:31,889 --> 03:25:36,850
The newest addition to the custom robot line it can attack and change directions while doing an air dash

2251
03:25:37,409 --> 03:25:42,159
It can only air dash once but it travels for a long time. It almost looks like it's flying

2252
03:25:42,959 --> 03:25:49,840
However, it moves really slowly on the ground. It's got a low defense and it's that's that's weakness got it. Thanks

2253
03:25:50,639 --> 03:25:55,250
There are 13 pages of this shit and every one of them we're gonna get an explanation

2254
03:25:55,969 --> 03:25:59,479
All right, we've got ape

2255
03:25:59,479 --> 03:26:12,819
What do you got a flame cannon a straight g?

2256
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:15,399
caboose x

2257
03:26:15,399 --> 03:26:19,399
This is like really cool looking actually. This is a really cool looking robo

2258
03:26:20,120 --> 03:26:24,440
I was a straight g pretty straight ahead

2259
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:29,040
six rounds

2260
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:37,459
Lame. All right, i'm gonna keep the ape. What's i'm gonna check caboose x

2261
03:26:38,260 --> 03:26:42,069
we'll see

2262
03:26:42,069 --> 03:26:44,149
huge attack and huge size

2263
03:26:46,930 --> 03:26:48,930
