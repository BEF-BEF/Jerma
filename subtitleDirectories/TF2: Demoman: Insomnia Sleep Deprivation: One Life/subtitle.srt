1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,380
Hey, what is happening everybody?

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,380
Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary playing today as the Demoman.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,379
Using the regular grenade launcher, the regular default sticky launcher, and the half Zatoichi.

4
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,379
Got a pretty good gameplay coming up here. I'm sorry, I really do apologize to you guys.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,379
Because this is really my first Demoman gameplay in a long time, probably since like the summertime.

6
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,619
I've done Demo Night gameplays, but those don't really count, to be quite honest.

7
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,619
They're just for fun, they're just for the lulz, I guess.

8
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:43,619
But this is a real Demoman gameplay, just right now showing off a double Kritzkrieg.

9
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,619
Because I thought it was ridiculous and I had to put it in.

10
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,619
But this is not the gameplay, the gameplay is going to start in about 30 seconds or so.

11
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,920
So that first Kritzkrieg went pretty well, but the second one not so much.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,920
I really did not expect it. I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, why am I getting two Kritzkriegs?

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,350
What's happening to me?

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,349
This right here, I love this part. I get the half Zatoichi Krit on that medic and then watch this.

15
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,349
I know I'm going to die, so I just jump out of here like boing.

16
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,780
I just thought that was a great clip.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,219
So now let's transition to the real gameplay, also on Gold Rush, also on Defense.

18
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:21,390
I actually just watched this whole thing back, and I guess this is a one life gameplay.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,819
I didn't even realize that.

20
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,819
But what I want to talk about in this gameplay, as you'll know from the title,

21
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to talk about insomnia and I want to talk about sleep deprivation and what it does to you.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,609
So right now I'm looking at my fake watch on my arm right now.

23
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,609
It is five o'clock in the morning right now as I'm recording this.

24
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,849
Now I haven't slept at all. I haven't gone to bed and woken up.

25
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,849
It's not like, oh, it's five in the morning. Time to get up and go on my regular day.

26
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,849
No, I haven't gone to bed yet.

27
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,849
I actually have been lying in my bed for like three hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not happening.

28
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,219
And this is a real problem with me right now where I'm going to sleep at like six or seven in the morning

29
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,459
and waking up at seven or eight o'clock at night.

30
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,460
Sometimes a little earlier than that, but a lot of times I get up around five to eight at night.

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,819
And it's really starting to mess with my brain.

32
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,770
So here's a good example of this, right?

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,770
So I go to sleep when it's dark outside.

34
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,139
Five a.m. or six a.m. the sun still has not risen yet.

35
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,379
And then when I wake up at like six or seven at night, it's dark out.

36
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,379
So when I go to sleep when it's dark out and wake up when it's dark out,

37
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,379
my brain pretty much is saying, Jerma, are we living in the friggin' Ice Age?

38
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,740
What the hell is going on? And it really screws with you.

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,740
And it's also really hard to correct as well.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,740
I can't just really snap my fingers and go, I'm going to wake up tomorrow at a reasonable time.

41
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740
I'm going to go to sleep at a reasonable time. No, no, no, it doesn't work that way.

42
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,740
The only way to really correct this is to stay up this entire day,

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,050
drink four or five cups of coffee, and just go.

44
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,219
And stay awake, try as hard as I can, force myself to stay awake until like nine o'clock at night.

45
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,590
And I've tried to do this so many times.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,590
I go, yeah, let's get some coffee. I'm going to play some video games.

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,590
I'm going to stay up.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,590
And what ends up happening, somewhere around noon to two, I'd say,

49
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,590
I just go, oh, that bed looks great over there.

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,900
And I just fall into it and just die and stay asleep until like 11 o'clock at night.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,819
And at that point, you pretty much just live in Japan.

52
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,819
And one really horrible thing about all this, I will fall asleep at one o'clock in the afternoon,

53
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,819
sleep the whole day the whole night, look at my cell phone,

54
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,819
and there will be four or five missed calls and at least two messages I didn't get to.

55
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,819
And people probably think I'm dead.

56
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,129
I tried to call you like four times during when human beings are awake,

57
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,129
and you didn't answer, like, what are you doing?

58
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,560
And this has been going on for quite a long time, at least in my case.

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,740
I started doing this, started the whole sleep during the day and wake up at night thing.

60
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I started doing this probably my first year in college.

61
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,740
I was a freshman, and obviously I was one of those people that loved to be awake at night.

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Night owl, real night owl in high school.

63
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
But you can't really be a night owl in high school.

64
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
It's very difficult because you have to wake up really early.

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,100
So in college, I started to get the freedom.

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
I said, all right, this is awesome.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I can do whatever I want.

68
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,339
I have class at like 12 p.m.

69
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:36,019
And that's where all this started, going on probably seven years now.

70
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:41,019
And it kind of concerns me because I'm afraid I'm going to go to the doctor one day and tell him all this.

71
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:47,500
And he's going to go, uh, Jeremy, that's, uh, you're going to die tomorrow or something like that.

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You know, oh, you're going to die in like three months because your brain can't get enough activity or something crazy.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
But it really does concern me sometimes.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,930
So I'm trying to, as I get older, correct it.

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,930
So let me know in the comments section if you guys as well are dealing with insomnia or if you've gone through something like this before.

76
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,930
And if you have any tips or any folk remedies or something along the lines of, well,

77
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,930
if you smell onions and you brush your teeth for 35 seconds exactly, you fall asleep within 10 minutes of lying down.

78
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,300
If you guys have something like that, let me know because I definitely would like to hear it.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,660
So let's wrap this up by talking about the gameplay a little bit.

80
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,660
I have a really bad fail coming up and it's pretty embarrassing.

81
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,660
So you'll see it when it comes. It's at the very end of the gameplay.

82
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,970
It's actually why we lose the game.

83
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,970
But I've done pretty well. I haven't done terribly.

84
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,970
This is a pretty good gameplay, got a bunch of kills, bunch of critscreegs,

85
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,970
had a couple of medic buddies that were with me pretty much the whole time.

86
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,269
So it works out OK.

87
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,699
But here comes the fail.

88
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,699
At the end of that critscreeg kills the sniper up in that roost.

89
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,699
I turn around, see a soldier and a scout.

90
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,699
I'm like, oh, does the soldier got this on? He's got it under control, baby.

91
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,699
So I turn around, preoccupy myself with the sniper.

92
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,699
And instead of going back there and dropping some stickies on the cart,

93
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,699
a heavy gets on it and we lose the game.

94
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,220
But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.

95
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,220
Thank you so much for watching.

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,220
Really do appreciate it.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,220
So I will see you guys all next time.

98
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,220
Take care, everybody.
