1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,599
Are you trying to shoot me?

2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,600
Kinda, I don't know.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,539
You look like you're about to be painted.

4
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,539
It seriously looks like you're about to be painted by an artist.

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,910
Like, pose right there for me. That's beautiful, yes.

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,729
I like how I'm not even breathing or moving.

7
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,729
I'm like a statue.

8
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:40,350
You really are a statue.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,789
Just stay like that the whole time.

10
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,490
I'm just delivering my statue to the art museum.

11
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,399
You still look like it.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Alrighty then, let's go get a helicopter.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,829
Alrighty then.

14
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,829
My car right now looks like...

15
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,829
You know when your dog gets into one of your toys and absolutely ruins it?

16
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,829
Yeah.

17
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,829
It really looks like a dog chewed up this car.

18
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,260
It's like this is the most messed up car I've ever driven in.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Everything is exposed.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,569
I'm at the airport right now.

21
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,640
Let me guess, that's you in that right now.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
That is you.

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Yeah, I can tell. What was that?

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
What was that?

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
What was that?

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I just ran you over.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,640
You just ran me over from behind?

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I was driving so fast.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Dude, on my screen I just instant died. Nothing even happened.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I just felt like...

31
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,269
Look at these guys coming in.

32
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:11,240
What? What the hell was that?

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
What just happened?

34
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,060
What? What the hell was that?

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,060
The WASD and the number pad.

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Where's my parachute? Where's my parachute?

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,060
Good, alright.

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,419
So meat, that thing is going to kill a lot of people.

39
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,419
I feel bad for whoever that lands on.

40
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,659
Oh my god, I'm watching it go down.

41
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,530
God, it's so scary. Who's it going to land on?

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Alright, I'm parachuting down to the Empire State Building. Is that you right there?

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,550
Hey, what's up, stealth?

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not happening. You're not doing that.

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,110
You're not doing this.

47
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,639
I'm not even going to be able to land on this thing.

48
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,939
Stop shooting me, please.

49
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,939
No, this is not going to work! No!

50
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,180
Before we do that, let's hope it works.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,680
I almost just fell off.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Alright, boo. Hold on to your hat.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
No, wrong way!

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,979
That was the wrong one again.

56
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,629
What is this like?

57
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:23,629
Alright, we're good. We're good.

58
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,629
You better not shoot me off at the top of this.

59
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,629
Oh my god, driving in sand.

60
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,939
I got it. I got this. Don't worry.

61
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,939
I got this. Don't worry.

62
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,939
Here we go. Ready? We're going to get up right now. Here we go.

63
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,430
Why are you just now getting in the door?

64
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,430
Oh my god, it actually worked!

65
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,430
It actually worked.

66
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,310
I thought you were just going to crash nose first and just stop still like driving into a brick wall.

67
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,310
Me too, but we Spiderman'd up the wall.

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,740
Alright.

69
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,300
Wow, this is like a challenge in itself. I feel like I'm playing Trials.

70
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,099
Alright, we made it to the grass.

71
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,099
I would describe this route as unconventional.

72
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,729
This is it, baby.

73
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,729
What's your guys favorite Kelly Clarkson song?

74
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,729
I really am sorry about this, boo, but this is going to be really, really funny.

75
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,730
Oh my dear.

76
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,730
No, I'm going to go off too!

77
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:37,459
Are you going to clear the building below you?

78
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,459
Yes.

79
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,829
Oh my god, you are right there.

80
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:43,829
I'm so tempted to shoot.

81
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,829
Oh, Jerma!

82
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,829
We're good. We're good. I'm good.

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,829
My helicopter is still below me, like where I landed it.

84
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,829
That's unbelievable. How did you do that?

85
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,829
Landed that? Very carefully.

86
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,829
Okay, so I just have to stay stable.

87
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,139
It's a stealth. You've got to be the judge. How close am I?

88
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:09,009
Pretty close.

89
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,009
Oh my god, you're like right next to it.

90
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,720
Should I jump into it?

91
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
I went through the blades!

92
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
You went through the blades?

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
How is that even possible?

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
How did you go through the blades?

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,089
Oh, no way.

96
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,089
Oh, Jesus.

97
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,089
No!

98
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:34,089
I looked away from my screen temporarily.

99
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,089
I look back up and I just see this toppling helicopter going instantly downwards.

100
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,519
Climbing up again.

101
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:49,009
Is that a cop right there?

102
00:05:50,009 --> 00:06:05,180
Never there for the good stuff.

103
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,699
I do that. I spawned all the way back.

104
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,699
Oh no, I'm here.

105
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,699
What did you do?

106
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,699
Oh, my head. I have an instant headache.

107
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,699
I have an instant headache.

108
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,389
Is that a cop right there?

109
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,339
What did you do?

110
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,569
Alright, you guys are behind me.

111
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,569
Are you guys on the highway behind me?

112
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:49,300
Where are you guys?

113
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
You guys are literally within 10 feet of me.

114
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Where are you guys?

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
How did you get that?

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
How did you time that so perfectly?

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,740
After I hit you, I did a 360 and just kept driving at the same speed.

118
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
How did you even hit me?

119
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
That was unbelievable that you actually connected with me.

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
I walked out in the middle of the highway.

121
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
I was like, where are you guys?

122
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Then you just ran into me.
