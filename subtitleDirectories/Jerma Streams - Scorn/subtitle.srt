1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:32,460
I have returned. I'm back. Hi, how are you? Good day to you. Safe track. Hey, I'm the Warcraft guy.

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:49,740
You remember me? I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. NPR Andy. Yeah, that's really cool. And I did not

3
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:59,850
ever think I was going to be on NPR, but here we are. Crazy. Disney. Oh yeah, I've been all over

4
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:13,370
the place. And I'm not done either. There's a few things coming up here this, I want to say next

5
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:26,620
couple weeks, that there will be, you'll be able to see. Also, official planning of the Battle

6
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:35,000
Act stream is officially underway. I'm going to prove that once and for all. You'll see that

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:51,640
sooner rather than later. And today we are going to play Scorn. I've heard things about this game.

8
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,030
I've heard this game is not what everybody thought it was. I've heard this game is amazing.

9
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,989
I've heard it's like, it's an incredible experience. I've heard it's not what they,

10
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:11,590
somebody was expecting. I don't know. You're going to rage at this. I mean, I don't know.

11
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,330
It looks creepy. It looks cool. I'm into it. I'm ready to see like how cool it's going to be,

12
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:29,340
how scary. I saw the same trailer you did. Raid someone? I just turned my stream off at the first

13
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,900
time for like two weeks. But I also got something to talk about too. So you guys are going to get

14
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,060
something here on this channel. This kind of end of the week here. You are going to get three

15
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:51,379
streams in a row. It is Omega Gaming Weekend 2. But the only difference this time is it is a

16
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:57,939
contractually obligated Omega Gaming Weekend. So I can't delay it. I can't move it. And I can't

17
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:05,479
just do it one 14 hour stream. So I'm going to be contractual. You're going to get three streams in

18
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:12,599
a row because I'm contractually obligated to be here. I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights.

19
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:22,439
It's going to be sponsored by WP with three days in a row. And what that means

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,400
is not only am I going to be playing Gotham Knights for three days, I'm also going to be playing

21
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,430
other shit for three straight days. So we're going to do another Omega Gaming Weekend.

22
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,169
Maybe some Splatoon. Probably some Breath of the Wild. Maybe we'll sprinkle in some Sorcery. I know

23
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:55,750
people have been waiting for that. More Turmoil. No, yeah, I can't play Turmoil for eight hours.

24
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,860
It's not going to happen. And look, scary stuff too. I want to play the new Puppet Combo game.

25
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,050
We'll do that this weekend. It's not just going to be Gotham Knights, but Gotham Knights will be a

26
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,770
part of each one of these streams. And it's not and it's not like, oh, yeah, guys, I got up today

27
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:22,170
and like, I gotta have a headache and my back kind of hurts. I'll stream four days from now.

28
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:35,509
Nope. You should play Guitar Hero. I mean, it's been a long time. Oh, you bet. You better believe

29
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:45,029
I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt. Yes, I am. 100%. 100%. Is it going to be Saturday,

30
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:51,829
Sunday, Monday? It's going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So it's Omega, I don't know, Omega end

31
00:04:51,829 --> 00:05:09,579
of the week. End. Kind of. You should play PS1 games. Maybe. I did that a while though. Yes,

32
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:13,980
I will confirm today. The most important announcement you'll hear on this channel

33
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:25,160
over the next six months. I will be playing Among Us VR as the sus guy, the day it launches.

34
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:40,939
I told everybody I promised him I would do it. And I'm going to. I promised. Now that means I

35
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:46,329
could literally play it for 10 minutes. But I was kind of thinking of really just cashing in on that

36
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:52,310
meme. And look, people are going to come to this channel when I stream that and just be like,

37
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,230
wait, this is the sus guy. So I'm going to brand the entire channel that way.

38
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:02,069
All the branding you see here right now will not be here that day. It's going to be the sus face

39
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:10,089
everywhere. The stream title is going to be the sus guy finally plays Among Us. All the emotes,

40
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:16,300
all the badges, they're going to be the sus face just for one day only. I'm leaning into this. I'm

41
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:29,819
cashing out on this meme. I get to. When does it come out? What day does it come out? Is it when?

42
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:43,430
Like, I don't know. I need to prepare for this. November 10th. You should keep you should have a

43
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:53,420
sus filter on. Wait, have the sus face on my face. But I talked about this, right? I was concerned

44
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:02,089
about this. Because if I do this, I'm going to break the dollhouse viewer record. You don't

45
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,170
understand what I'm saying? I will break the dollhouse viewer record. And I'll never be able

46
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:18,040
to do anything else. I'll have to be the sus guy forever. Okay, let me ask you this. This is what

47
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,360
an inflated ego. No, I'm just saying I'm just I'm preparing for the worst here. So if I do the sus

48
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,480
guy, and I rebrand the whole channel to be the sus guy, and I play Among Us, and there's like

49
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,120
80,000 people watching. And the next day, like 50,000 people are watching. And they're like, dude,

50
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,269
where's more Among Us sus guy? I mean, what am I? Should I just cash in for like a month?

51
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:51,930
But then all the long term people that have been watching this channel will just leave

52
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:58,009
and I'll go back to the normal viewership numbers that I've been seeing. And it'll all only be

53
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,490
Among Us sus guy viewers. I'm going to be in trouble here. Maybe I shouldn't do this. Well,

54
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:15,699
we'll see. It's gonna be a new community. That's so stupid. All right, let me tweet this. I'll be

55
00:08:15,699 --> 00:09:10,039
right back. Good thing I got that one off. I had 1% battery. I think I got that on. Oh, RT game

56
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:19,590
with the raid. Hey, what's up? Spent some time with RT over the last few days here.

57
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:31,059
Good to see him again. Trying to actually go do things with friends and family. I've been

58
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,899
kind of just kind of in work mode essentially for a long time. So it's really nice to see a lot of

59
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:45,350
people. I'm so aloof you guys would not even know. You don't even understand. But hey, thanks to the

60
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:49,429
thanks for the raid. Saw Taleks hung out with Taleks again, too. That's cool. Good to see

61
00:09:49,429 --> 00:10:04,179
everybody. Are you you played Overwatch 2 for 80 hours? I didn't. All right, you guys ready? No,

62
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:10,149
we're done stalling. It's time to play some scorn. That's what I imagine when I click on

63
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:26,490
when I click a new game here. It's gonna go scorn. Does it do that? And we're live. Does it do it?

64
00:10:27,129 --> 00:11:21,220
When I click new game, is it gonna go scorn? Is that me? Scorn. Oh, Jesus loud. Hold on.

65
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:54,360
Oh, this game doesn't have any hints. Good luck. Well, that's what you guys are for.

66
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:11,750
I'll get them. I'll get them. So I asked this in pre stream. Is this a gug at a game?

67
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:23,639
Does it actually do we are we going to get some of that or no, it's not. What is it? It's a this is

68
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,740
a okay. No, it's not. Well, I'm not even going to explain that because the people that it's the

69
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,799
people that know, you know what I mean? The sensitivity is way too high. And by the way,

70
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:47,480
this FOV is controls sensitivity, right? Camera settings. All right, here we go. Way down. FOV.

71
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:57,850
What was this? This is a numerical value. What is what would this be? So what's 90? Am I at

72
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,590
90 right here? I wonder. I don't know. I feel like this I needed a numerical value here.

73
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:12,200
All right, let's try that. It's better. A little too low. I have to do my settings. Just wait.

74
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:27,720
That's way too high. That's still a little high, but it's better. All right. That's good. That's

75
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:45,110
fine. How's it look? Turn off mouse smoothing. Oh, smoothing. Okay. All right. So let's go.

76
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,740
I got to press this button. I got to figure out the puzzle. All right. So what I have to do is

77
00:13:49,740 --> 00:14:02,899
I just woke up in a distant land that I'm not familiar with. Do I have a map? I mean,

78
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:17,509
the game looks really nice. Should I be not should I be walking? Right. I feel like I shouldn't just

79
00:14:17,509 --> 00:15:05,690
be spinning around. This is getting scary. I turn it up. This is scary. It's crazy. How can I tell

80
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:17,690
if I can open these doors? Is it fall damage? Okay, I can't. I'm just gonna go down there.

81
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:40,419
Everything looks cool. I heard some move because it's just left click to interact.

82
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:45,779
Why does it look good? But also like a PS2 game. I think that's why I like it.

83
00:15:45,779 --> 00:16:07,669
Let's think that. Is it filter? What do you mean filter? TOS? What do you mean TOS? What are you

84
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:21,590
talking about? Keep it on. I don't care. All right. Um, ignore it. All right. So I can't touch this.

85
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:31,779
I need to have. Whoa. That sounded fake. That was a fake. Whoa. It was. I have to admit to that.

86
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,779
That was actually fake. It's been like two weeks since I've been live guys. I got to remember how

87
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,590
to like actually stream normally. That was genuinely. I made that up. Me saying, whoa,

88
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,389
I got caught. I actually made that up. So like I gotta, I gotta get back into this.

89
00:16:46,389 --> 00:17:13,539
I forgot how to like pretend to have fun. What's this thing? Oh, whoa. That was real. It just

90
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:30,420
sounded a little deflated. Okay. So I have a thing on my arm now. What the hell? That's weird.

91
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,210
Is this toilet? This looks like a toilet of some kind. Like what is this? Is it an alien toilet?

92
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:59,960
All right. Well, it's definitely right here. Use direction. Wait, I don't get it. Okay. Wait,

93
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:19,990
I can switch between them. Okay. Just turn them both on. How do I get out? How do I get out of

94
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:32,539
the blood pressure reading machine? How? Oh, exit. Right. Okay. All right. There we go.

95
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:57,190
130 over fucking 70, dude. I'm fine. Yo, I didn't make it. Oh, come on. I have to keep it there

96
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:07,750
until. Okay. I need to stay in here. It's not just activate and walk away. It's activate. Stay in

97
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:20,299
here. Now we exit and we sprint. There we are. Okay. I get it. Give me an extra second or two.

98
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:37,539
So can I attack with this thing? I definitely have to climb up this thing. All right.

99
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:43,289
Get to the top of that and activate it. He's never going to complete this game.

100
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:48,619
That's what everybody says about every puzzle game that I've ever played. Okay. I'm going to

101
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:54,950
beat this. I will complete it. Everybody says that every time I play a puzzle game. Oh, hey,

102
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,230
dude. He's never going to beat this ever. And then I beat it. Like it takes me an extra four to six

103
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:22,460
hours than a normal human, but I still do. What is this? I don't know. I don't exactly know what

104
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:38,890
I'm doing here, but okay. I can, I don't know. All right. Whatever. Is it fall damage? Remember

105
00:20:38,890 --> 00:21:13,259
you're an alien. What does this do? Okay. I don't get it. This game sucks. I'm done. I can push this,

106
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:25,319
right? Why does it tell me I can touch this? This thing's on a track. So how do I get it to move on

107
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:45,430
the track? It goes like this over here. And then what the hell is this thing? All right. So I am

108
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,839
on the track track moves like this. I've got this is correct because this, I want this to go down

109
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,950
here. Otherwise it would just spin around in a circle around this whole environment. So I've

110
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,700
already got it in the right place. I just have to move it and trying to figure that out. It's going

111
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:27,700
to be the challenge. Can I pick it up? What if I just leave it here? How do I activate this? How

112
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:37,690
do I get this move? Like go and take you forever? No, it's not. It's the first. I'm fine. I just

113
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:52,759
don't, I didn't know how to turn the thing on. Is this it? What is all this wacky shit in this

114
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:01,670
cathedral wherever we are? Do I have to get it here? All right, hold on. What is this thing?

115
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:31,369
How do I get the chair to move? Because this is, I did this correct. I just need to move the chair.

116
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:51,369
It's a two player puzzle. What? No, it's not. There's a lie. What can I do with this thing?

117
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,609
I am not going to be one of the people that said they quit this game in 10 minutes.

118
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:02,170
Because they thought it was going to be like, I'm not one of those people. I'm not quitting

119
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:13,930
the game in 10 minutes. No, I'm not doing it. Wait, what's this? Oh, I know what this is.

120
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:33,750
Okay, so can I move it? That's to get it to go up that way. Very obviously, I need to, I need to

121
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:48,920
figure out how to move the chair. I need to get that thing to fucking move that way. Is there like

122
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:58,059
a power thing I have to turn on? There's more places to explore. Oh, okay. I don't even know

123
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:06,759
where, I don't know what direction I came from. I'm just going to go this way. I need a map. Oh,

124
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:25,829
shit. Okay. I thought that was a concentrated puzzle. That's my bad. Okay, so what is this?

125
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:42,150
Okay, that's that scoops up whatever's in there. So what I need to put something in there to scoop

126
00:25:42,150 --> 00:26:09,349
it up in here. All right. So how do I scoop some stuff in there? What should I scoop? Okay,

127
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:16,069
dude, what are you doing? Why? No, pick up one of these cubes. Pick up one of these. Scoop this

128
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:32,569
stuff. Okay, I can't do this. So they're both scoopers. Both are scoopers. And I can't use

129
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:42,420
them right now. So I'm gonna leave. I'm actually, I'm very interested in this game. I'm very

130
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,539
interested. I'll tell you right now. I'm not very good at puzzles, but I'm very interested in this

131
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:55,240
game. I want to know who the fuck I am. Why am I here? What am I doing here? Right? That to me is

132
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,980
worth me doing puzzles. I'm I want to know what I'm doing here. Who am I? Why am I here? Okay,

133
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:22,700
let me go this way. Can't activate these. All right, give me something. Give me like a bat,

134
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:32,490
a thing of meat or something to scoop, right? I've got nothing to scoop. I actually don't

135
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:50,789
have anything to scoop. There's all these scoopers and I can't scoop anything. You'll see. No help.

136
00:27:50,789 --> 00:28:01,910
No help. No help. That's fine. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. When is he going to start

137
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:41,130
scorn? Scorning? What's this thing? I feel like get in this thing. It's like sod. This shit's so

138
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:54,259
weird. It's like this organic shit. You know what I'm saying? It's creepy. Organic tech. Weird.

139
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:18,920
Should I pick up like a like a skeleton or something and grind it up? I can hear something.

140
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:57,589
What's the point of this? Yo, what do I do? You beat Elden Ring yet? I got to the one of that

141
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:04,200
horse bosses the very beginning and I just puzzle games are like more my thing. So I quit it because

142
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,599
I just thought I'm not really into it. I'm more into like puzzle stuff. My game's just too fucking

143
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:27,799
hard. Like it's just, you know what I mean? I like stuff like this. Okay. Wait, what about here? I

144
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:34,230
already went down here. Okay. So very obviously I have to grind up something, put it into one of

145
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:41,029
the scoop machines and then the scoop machine will scoop out a, I don't know, something to use. I

146
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:50,099
don't know what to do. How come there's not every 15 seconds the game pauses and freezes and tells

147
00:30:50,099 --> 00:31:01,349
me how to walk and like what interact button does. Okay. Try using your brain. I didn't think to do

148
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:17,619
that. All the rails. I just did that. Didn't I? There's the grind thing. All right. I'm going to

149
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:35,369
follow this one. Yeah. I, I, but how do I turn the cart on? I understand the concept of moving the

150
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:40,259
rails and changing the directions and everything, but how do I turn this? I'm just stupid. It's at

151
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:45,259
this game. I almost said stupid. I that's, I that one. That's not what I was going to say. How do

152
00:31:45,259 --> 00:32:05,700
I turn the machine on? Explore more. Where have I not gone? I can't do this. It's gotta be something

153
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:28,809
to do. Maybe over here. Cause did I, did I go down here yet? I don't think so. No, I did.

154
00:32:28,809 --> 00:33:10,859
I can hear a sound. Oh wait, what's this? What? Why can't I use this? What is this? You have to

155
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:25,420
pay attention to every possible path. I'm going to, I'm going to get a whiteboard in here. I'm

156
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,849
going to have to map this out. There's no map. There's no map. Somebody said you went down every

157
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:58,380
single path except for the correct one. That's not possible. You've literally did. There's an

158
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:14,409
elevator. What elevator? You keep missing controls. It's where the scoop is. It's,

159
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:27,960
it's the concrete level all over again. I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do.

160
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,639
Look, you guys are going to make me part of like a video essay on, look at how spoiled we've become

161
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,519
with all these developers giving us every hint we've ever needed. StreamerGerman985 couldn't

162
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,739
fucking find his way around scorn because there's no map and there's no fabled two breadcrumbs.

163
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,860
You guys are going to make me part of a video essay on how gamers need all this shit nowadays.

164
00:34:50,860 --> 00:35:11,619
I could dodge a fucking axe on stream and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna dodge a battle axe

165
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:19,980
on stream and you're not going to be able to say shit for months. You just ignored it again? What?

166
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,340
What? Where? What did I ignore? I don't get it. Everything is, everything is made of meat and

167
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:45,780
bones and shit. What am I missing? I missed something? Where? It's in here? Is this it?

168
00:35:45,780 --> 00:36:04,260
It's in the snow. It's in the scoop room. No, it's in the scoop room. I don't, I don't. Guys,

169
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,420
if you paid me a million dollars to find the scoop room right now in 10 seconds,

170
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:17,239
I wouldn't be able to do it. Let's try. Let's see if I can get a million dollars. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

171
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:23,480
5, 4, 3, 2. Well, that's not fair because it would have taken more than 10 seconds to get here.

172
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,519
What? Okay. Did I, did I get, did I make a million dollars? If I go straight from here,

173
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:48,889
did I get a million? Nope. I don't get a million dollars. That would have been such an easy million.

174
00:36:48,889 --> 00:37:06,900
It's the same room. Okay. You're talking about the room that has the scoop machine in it. No,

175
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,500
I don't owe you a million. I just said if I got there in 10 seconds, I would get a million. It's

176
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:24,389
over here. It's not over there. Okay. All right. Where? Where? Oh my fucking God. I couldn't even

177
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:31,000
see this. I didn't even see this. This like just didn't exist in my brain. Everything's made of

178
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:50,019
fucking bones. I walked in here. Everything's bones and like sinew. Okay. I, it's hard to know

179
00:37:50,019 --> 00:38:07,320
where I need to go. Nobody talk from the elevator. Straight ahead is the big room. Okay. Lock it in

180
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,920
straight ahead from the elevator. Big room, big room with a bunch of big shit in it.

181
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:18,980
Left from the elevator. Left is dinosaur rib cage machine. Left from left is dinosaur rib cage

182
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:28,309
machine. Got it. Locked in dinosaur rib cage machine. Big room on the right side over here.

183
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:34,460
On the right side, left is dinosaur rib cage area. Straight ahead is big room over on the right side.

184
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:49,539
We have hallway leading to a wires and then here we are leading to a um I don't know. I don't know.

185
00:38:49,539 --> 00:39:12,039
Where does it go? This is on the right side. Remember. I don't remember this. It's alarming

186
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:20,900
how many message deleted there are. Okay. What does that mean though? How do I get into that room?

187
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:30,780
Where's my little fucking robot that's flying around that can be like oh of course go that way.

188
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:39,269
Now I think that if you go one meter to the left. Where's my inventory? Where's my a million ammo?

189
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:57,670
This is still on the right side by the way. You still have the first puzzle in your 40 minutes

190
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,909
into the game. No. No. The stream has been live for 40 minutes. I've only been playing the game

191
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:15,530
for about 20. Don't lie. Don't lie. Don't lie. It's been about 16 minutes or so. Okay so it's

192
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:21,400
just a big circle and there's nothing here. There's just this I don't know where I don't

193
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,159
actually don't know where I am. Did I do a few? Okay I did a big circle. There's the big room.

194
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,500
So it's a gigantic circle that goes around the whole thing. So what does this do?

195
00:40:31,500 --> 00:41:13,420
What's this? God damn it. What is this? I don't even know what the what the object is.

196
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,300
Oh my god this is gonna be horrible. What do I need to do? I need to move this?

197
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:39,429
What? Shit. Okay do I have to get this all the way around the other side? I don't get it. Okay but

198
00:41:39,429 --> 00:42:03,960
what's the goal? Is the goal to get the lit up light to move? Okay which ones can even move?

199
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:12,360
Okay they can only move into the holes. So then all right so can I go like this? I can't move this

200
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:21,750
down. Move this up? Okay wait now what if I do this? Can I pick it up with the other one? What

201
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:41,590
happens if I pick it up? Does this do anything? Okay so I have to get what about the other eggs?

202
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:53,719
The ones with the lights on them maybe? I'm imagining that this has to come up like the

203
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:02,659
ones with the lights. Is that what it looks like I guess? I don't know. I'm gonna try it.

204
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:41,690
Okay does that matter? Because that one has lights on it. I can't hear how that sounded.

205
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:48,170
It probably sounded really fucking bad. All right whoa whoa whoa what was that? I just I didn't even

206
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,650
I missed the in- who cares what my voice sounded like? What did I just do? What happened? It broke

207
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:08,440
and fell down. So that was not- it shattered and fell down there. It's a- all right well let me get

208
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:36,139
the other one. Oh that's really annoying. Okay um yeah out of the fucking way.

209
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:10,570
Shit! All right I have to get- this is- this is gonna move this one here. Where am I bringing it?

210
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,230
These are locked in place but can I move these? I can move these over here.

211
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:26,010
I don't think it's that complicated. Bring this all the way down. Bring this all the way up. Right?

212
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:37,699
Because this has- I have to get this out of the way. Let's go like this for now. I don't. So what

213
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:51,380
if I do this? Can I at least get this up here? I can. All right. There's that. But I have a new

214
00:45:51,380 --> 00:46:56,250
problem. Problem solved? Kind of. This better be it. Did I do it? I mean not- it's close.

215
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:04,599
Uh okay I gotta go- we're gonna be able to go that way. Can I move this all the way down?

216
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:39,420
Fuck! All right what about- hold on. I think I got it. Yeah that's it. I got it. I hope this is right

217
00:47:39,420 --> 00:48:10,219
otherwise I screwed this whole- no shit! I gotta- can I zoom in? This sucks. I think I- I think I

218
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:23,699
screwed the whole thing up because I can go over here but I can't go down. There's no scenario

219
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:34,250
where I can get this up here. I have to move everything. What needs to be moved? Somebody

220
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:50,280
said I hate this game. It's- it's- I'm playing it. Let me move this because I- there's an area where

221
00:48:50,280 --> 00:49:11,750
I can get this down. Can I- can I move this? I can't move this up. I can't go across here.

222
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:24,860
I need to get that single one down here. Hold on. All this shit has to be out of the way completely.

223
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:36,150
Right? Like it has to be. There's no other way to do this. No no no don't move this yet.

224
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:49,099
So this now comes over here and comes down right? Then this comes over all the way over here.

225
00:49:49,820 --> 00:50:12,900
Then I should be able to- no because this has to- wait I got it. Oh I got it. We're good. Oh thank

226
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:34,420
god. Okay. I hope this is right. Average thinker. I'm- I got it. I'm fine. What are you doing? What

227
00:50:34,420 --> 00:51:13,670
do you mean? I'm gonna have to grind this thing up. I'm gonna have to grind that up. Yeah okay I get

228
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:32,760
it. It's a wild puzzle. Oh man puzzles. What I'm known for here. So back down into that room

229
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:42,699
where the um kind of the saw is. Doritos. No it's not gonna work this time. It's not gonna work.

230
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay I'm imagining I have to take- it probably came down this side right? Burn this into my

231
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:09,369
brain. This image right here. Okay I got it. So that means that this is where the scooper is.

232
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:21,800
If I see this exact image with like the thing hanging in over there. Okay stop saying Doritos.

233
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:54,900
It doesn't mean anything. What is going on? What is that sound? Where is it? Oh shit it's above me.

234
00:52:54,900 --> 00:54:04,340
All right wait where's this going? This is gonna go over here. So where do I want this to end up?

235
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:17,590
So if it stays on this track which it could it could it's gonna go in here into the scoop room

236
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:25,510
which I don't think I'm ready for that yet right? I think I need to to put the I need to um use the

237
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:34,019
blade. I think that's what I have to do. So let me see where that is because where is it over here?

238
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:41,130
I gotta get into memory. All right so I need to move that- where is this one going? I gotta close

239
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:50,630
that up and see where this is. What's this over here? Track will go over here, through here,

240
00:54:50,630 --> 00:55:05,530
around the corner, into- here it is. All right so uh okay let's- I'm gonna go move the tracks.

241
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:18,340
How's it- why is everybody saying yay and nay? All right so I gotta close up that one back here

242
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:26,380
because you know what I mean I have to move this. So this one is already correct but I have to close

243
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:40,869
this one. So this one has to come back over this way. So close up that one and that's the only one

244
00:55:40,869 --> 00:56:11,800
that needs to be closed. Yes all right that's good. So it's where- where is- where am I?

245
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:23,349
It's this one over here. Where's it going? Okay so that's what I need. That's correct. We good?

246
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:59,420
Let's go. Let's go. All right begin. Move. What are you doing? He's reaching. What's going on? Wait

247
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:10,780
what? No no I want to keep going on this track. Can I do this? Let me see what this does.

248
00:57:27,289 --> 00:58:12,619
What did I do? What did I just do? I don't know. I- this feels like I shouldn't be doing this.

249
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:30,150
Okay well we're going this way and then this wraps all the way around and then it's the-

250
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:55,340
the- should I- I don't know should I put him in this thing? Okay.

251
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:31,219
Okay now what? Now I- I- do I have to pick it up? Dude what the fuck? No no no no stop go back.

252
00:59:44,599 --> 01:00:00,119
Wait a second. Okay now I can click. What the fuck? Wait they go in- what's the point of doing this

253
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:10,119
though? What is the point of this? What- what's the point of this? Why would I do this? What's the point?

254
01:00:37,619 --> 01:01:11,219
What the hell? Hey wait he's getting up. Should I run? I feel like I've been- the game has given me

255
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:21,940
an opportunity to run away before this guy Michael Myers is me for like the next six hours. Help him.

256
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:35,210
I- I- how? What am I supposed to- why is that sound effect happening? Why is that sound effect

257
01:01:35,210 --> 01:02:10,519
happening right now? Help him please. How? Can I like- standing? Yeah. Am I supposed to do something?

258
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:32,760
Oh wait no no no no no no. Walking? Walking? Wait you're just- are you following me? Okay um so now

259
01:02:32,760 --> 01:03:04,389
we're gonna go sit you in the- in the scoop machine and get- get you scooped up. Careful. Can he use

260
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:10,780
this? This would make sense right considering that this two- this is the- yeah this is co-op partner.

261
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:47,559
Yep. What do I do? How do I help him? Wait what? Jesus dude. Oh my god.

262
01:03:48,360 --> 01:04:06,260
Ah you're gonna need a gun. Let me give you the- let me just take a look go into my menu and find

263
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,659
the thing with zero ammo and the gun that I never upgraded and it's a pistol with maybe one bullet

264
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:39,429
in it. Here take it. So let's try- let's get- let's get that big door open right here. Come on. You

265
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:57,880
didn't even give you a new friend a name? I- we just met. I got a- I don't know. After a little

266
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:07,269
while I'll come up with a good name. All right come over here and touch it. Go come and put your hand

267
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:20,550
over here. All right come on come over here we'll get this open.

268
01:05:33,769 --> 01:06:00,699
Dude this sucks. This is like fucking horrible. So this is open. All right so stay right there

269
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:23,769
for a sec. Did you just lock me in here? I was just about to give uh I was about to give you a

270
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:54,630
name too. No you locked him in there. It's gonna be some like AI took control and has been killing

271
01:06:54,630 --> 01:07:24,260
us. I don't know. It's some- it's gonna be some alien alien tech. You know what I mean? Yeah humanity

272
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:30,869
is being like harvested by the aliens and they're using a- they're using us for their alien tech.

273
01:07:30,869 --> 01:08:42,600
What was that? That's creepy. Ace in there? He's gonna break open. All right room with all these

274
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:57,020
pods. Can I do anything with this? Looks like a quake map. Wait what am I doing with this mine?

275
01:08:57,020 --> 01:10:16,739
Okay uh all right up there. I knew it. Fucking alien tech. I don't know why I think that's funny.

276
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:24,819
It's just- I don't know it's just a word. Am I inside of a thing that's just alive or something?

277
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:41,829
This thing's alive. What does this do for me? What does this do for me? I don't know. I don't get it.

278
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:52,250
Um I guess I can turn this a different way or- no I can't. What else is in here? Can I move this?

279
01:10:54,199 --> 01:11:11,850
Okay I can move this again to there? I don't know. I'm gonna try it. You're- oh I'm so sorry

280
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:22,859
that probably hurt your ears. Have you ever seen alien? Yeah um let me- do I just get another one

281
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:31,340
and put it somewhere else? Do I have access to any more of those? I saw those things sticking out.

282
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:35,979
I definitely have access to more of those things. Right? I gotta place them here. I think I know

283
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:44,920
what I have to do. Let me get out of here. All right. There's more of those um uh uh the alien

284
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:55,510
tech globes. Do I have to pick one up and put it over here? Or do I have to pick that? I would

285
01:11:55,510 --> 01:12:03,590
put it in here. I don't know. That's what I'm going with. That's what I think I have to do. So

286
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:16,170
I'm gonna try it. What is it back here right? Yeah okay. So can I just pull one of these off?

287
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:24,199
I gotta be- this is gonna be a way to get that off right? Something to do with this

288
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,989
but I don't have whatever that uh attachment is or something yet.

289
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:43,539
Huh okay. So that's not what I have to do. Uh oh. Seeing a lot of not like this. Go back. Go back.

290
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:56,859
So do I just pull it out of there and then put it in one of the other slots?

291
01:12:56,859 --> 01:13:09,800
That's what I'm thinking. It looks like I couldn't do that though. All right I'm gonna look over here.

292
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:32,390
Is there anything else? Is this a big circle? Oh oh found one! How do I get that? How do I pick

293
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:51,220
this up? I can't pick this up. I need more- you need more alien tech. Okay there's another one.

294
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:59,140
All right it's a big circle so I've obviously this is not done here yet. I need to go somewhere else.

295
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:04,819
I guess. I feel like it's that's the thing that's powering that stuff. I'm just gonna go back.

296
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:19,100
Is this here? All right I need to lock this into memory. That's that way. When are you gonna get a

297
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,750
rocket launcher? I don't think I'm gonna get one of those. All right this is where I came from.

298
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:33,369
So what- is there anything over here? Now this is where I was.

299
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:49,130
Did I miss something else? I guess I could go over here back with this.

300
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:54,229
God I'm so sorry. Holy shit that was that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me.

301
01:14:54,229 --> 01:15:04,170
That was actually the worst thing that ever happened to me like my whole life.

302
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:13,020
It was- it was just a- it was like a weapons case appeared. So much shit has not happened

303
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:17,100
that I did not think that the weapons- whatever. Oh I got- oh we're ready to rock and roll. It's

304
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:31,220
time. Start playing the Guggernaut. Does this have ammo? This is the shittiest jump scare I've ever

305
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:55,000
had. Whatever. Does this have infinite ammo? This thing sucks. It's like a party horn.

306
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:15,819
Oh I'm out of ammo. So what do I do with this? So I take this back to there and I start- I can

307
01:16:15,819 --> 01:17:10,649
put this- okay I know what to do. This is gonna go right here. Oh cool. There we go. Okay so now

308
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:23,739
I go over here and I- they're all gonna be over here now. What? Did I supposed to do that? Oops.

309
01:17:29,989 --> 01:17:30,489
Hey!

310
01:17:51,880 --> 01:18:09,340
Too high. Okay. Did one of them fly over here? Oh look at that. Okay cool. I know what to do now.

311
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:40,569
Let's get it. We pick that one up. Stick it over there. Go! There we go. So where should I put it?

312
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:50,840
Spaces open up there. This is space right here. I'm just gonna put it here. I think. No I'm not.

313
01:18:50,840 --> 01:19:30,020
I'm gonna put it where the thing opened. All right. And there's one more. Taking my blood

314
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:42,199
something. That's definitely using my blood to power. Well I got it. Aliens are using human

315
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:48,310
blood as oil to power their machines and shit. Like our blood is oil to the aliens right? It

316
01:19:48,310 --> 01:20:02,260
has to be. Okay so this is here. There's another one. I gotta get- I have to crack down another

317
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:41,720
one of those lobe things. Where am I gonna get this last one? Oh the French champagne.

318
01:20:41,720 --> 01:21:27,579
There we go. All right. I should be able to open them all now. Get to it. See you later. See you later.

319
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:48,550
They're not gonna fucking harvest us. Dude those are just air conditioners.

320
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:57,689
Relax. You bastards aren't gonna harvest us anymore! Because you know he's talking to a

321
01:21:57,689 --> 01:22:19,930
fucking like air conditioning tube. Yeah you bastards! They were literally just cleaning stuff.

322
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:56,039
Dude you're speaking to a Roomba. Overloaded it with blood. I overloaded it with too much blood.

323
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:45,619
What the hell is going on? What the heck? I'm in a different like world. One sec. Otto is chilling

324
01:23:45,619 --> 01:24:00,939
in here. I'm gonna let him out. Wait hold on. Why am I like being born or something? This is weird.

325
01:24:01,659 --> 01:24:29,210
Wait it actually is the birth canal. Wait what? What the hell is going on in this game? All right

326
01:24:29,210 --> 01:25:27,579
give me one sec. I have returned. All right so I've been born. Did I rip that out? That was

327
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:41,899
the worst time to leave. You- did I- whatever. It's fine. I don't care. You missed it. I don't-

328
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:57,189
whatever. I don't- I didn't miss anything! You missed lore. Vital lore. It was a graphic umbilical

329
01:25:57,189 --> 01:26:03,270
cord removal. Oh whatever. All right well this is different. This is- I came out of the wall.

330
01:26:05,689 --> 01:26:15,930
There's other uh scorns here or whatever is going on. Let's go this way. Yeah we'll be- we're being

331
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:28,579
harvested and it's like- anybody seen the matrix? What a dumb question. I bet you're like everybody

332
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:44,500
probably has seen that. That's what it kind of feels like. Anybody- hey anybody seen the matrix?

333
01:26:48,789 --> 01:27:07,500
No dude. You're the only one. You're the only one. Like a ship? This is a different planet. Did we

334
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:18,470
land on this planet in search of something or contact and we ended up- we woke up this-

335
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:38,890
what is that? Is this backwards? This is backwards. This is backwards. Is that backwards?

336
01:27:38,890 --> 01:28:13,029
This is- I'm wrapping back around here. This is where I came from. Did I go all the way back?

337
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:19,989
That- I just wanted to circle. What about this way? Can I go this way?

338
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:38,539
It didn't look. No. Hey Jerma it's Dave from Mensa. I want to know that we've rejected your-

339
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:55,800
oh it's like a I'm dumb thing. Okay this is really cool though. The atmosphere is definitely on point.

340
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:40,579
Atmosphere? Nine. Weird. One of these is gonna get up. What's my goal here? I'm just walking

341
01:29:40,579 --> 01:30:11,000
around aimlessly. Okay I could go down over here. It's a cute game. All right let's go.

342
01:30:11,239 --> 01:31:11,140
I'm ready. It's like ships. Are these gravestones or like alien pods? Alien tech. Oh that's right.

343
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:24,170
That does what it is but that looks like. I don't- I don't think this- I don't think this one made it.

344
01:31:24,170 --> 01:32:02,970
I think I gotta go in here. Is there a door? Like a front door? Oh something over there.

345
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:16,149
Is that something glowing? All right hold on. This is the Futurama house.

346
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:26,859
That was- yeah that's- that's really good. That's like how did you- how would you even-

347
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:40,779
It's right though. Like you- you're completely accurate. It just is. All right I think I found

348
01:32:40,779 --> 01:32:57,029
a way in. This is one of those games where the graphics are so pretty. It's so- it's such a

349
01:32:57,029 --> 01:33:02,869
beautiful game in regards to uh human tech. I'm not talking about alien tech. I'm a graphics of

350
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:10,659
humanity. Uh the human tech on this is great which makes it way more unsettling. It's like

351
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:26,970
too real. It's like just all the graphics are good. Like really good so it just makes it worse.

352
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:42,859
All right so I don't know what this is. This thing is gonna start moving. It's gonna be all

353
01:33:42,859 --> 01:34:34,859
the organic shit. This is alive. Oh god it's a lizard person. All right do I have to fight that

354
01:34:35,579 --> 01:35:22,439
or hide from it? This is so weird. Oh god okay um honestly this is what I would do in real life.

355
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:40,810
That's what I would do in real life. I would get freaked out and fucking run away. I did it

356
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:53,420
and all the time all the while I'd be running and like clapping very very loudly. New uh my hand.

357
01:35:53,420 --> 01:36:27,420
It's saying I can touch it. Can I now put my arm in this? I guess I can't touch this right now.

358
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:34,859
All right let me get this into memory here. Oh my god wait where's the thing? Where's the monster?

359
01:36:37,779 --> 01:37:18,779
All right that's glowing red room. Remember that. Glowing red room is that area. I don't have

360
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:54,460
whatever this is. Interesting. I can't do anything over here. What do you think this smells like?

361
01:37:54,460 --> 01:38:12,840
Um okay you know that basement smell? That really heavy basement smell. I'm gonna say like that

362
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:38,090
and cheese. Okay so where am I supposed to go? The shadow I thought was the monster. Um could I have

363
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:45,239
done something with that? I just don't didn't see it. Or is there another way to go? It didn't look

364
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:57,479
like I could interact with anything in the red room. Oh you know what? No no basement and like

365
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:09,220
something that has been something burning. That's what it smells like down here. Red room. Red room.

366
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:29,720
I can't touch anything in here. Red room. Red. How do you do it? Let me see if I can do it.

367
01:39:32,899 --> 01:39:55,109
Red room. Red room. Red room. Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. Um there's nothing back here.

368
01:39:55,109 --> 01:40:20,920
Maybe go back out to the other. Out to the other area. Please tone it down. My kid's trying to

369
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:36,500
sleep. What headphones is it? And why? This is a scary thing to have on the tv. I'm gonna go back.

370
01:40:36,500 --> 01:41:03,739
I'm gonna get out of here. You keep walking right by it. Dude don't even tell me I'm doing that.

371
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:17,800
No that's down there. Can I go down? I can't go down here. I keep walking. I keep walking by it.

372
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:23,939
I didn't. This is the first skeleton person I've been able to interact with. How am I supposed to

373
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:34,439
know I could touch this? How am I supposed to know I could grab this thing? You know what?

374
01:41:34,439 --> 01:42:31,510
Monka S. Monka S chat. Open up. Did they get it? But what did that do? Oh it's just the wires cut.

375
01:42:31,510 --> 01:43:21,739
This doesn't this is not connected to anything. Wait is this creepy? Um oh hey hey hey what the

376
01:43:21,739 --> 01:43:34,489
fuck? What the hell was that? Okay well this is that. This is that. This is that. So I could have

377
01:43:34,489 --> 01:43:53,989
used the elevator. Okay this is that. The red room. I need to come back to the red room. I'm

378
01:43:53,989 --> 01:44:23,300
imagining I have to open those three things. Okay now we're up. Oh god. Little weirdo. All right

379
01:44:23,300 --> 01:45:49,100
what's over here? Nothing. I like this game. Whoa okay. Oh fuck. Dude look at all this over

380
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:58,630
engineered alien tech. Wait why am I I can do this from both sides? Wait hold on. I'm confused right

381
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:06,840
now. What just happened? Wait what would I do? I'm confused. What's going on? Just make walkways.

382
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,640
Yeah it's true. This over engineered alien bullshit. Just make walkways. Why does this

383
01:46:11,640 --> 01:48:06,470
shit have to exist? This is just overdoing everything. Uh oh. I don't get it. Okay so there's

384
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:25,699
red room. I have a key now. Probably for this. Whatever this is. Yep. Oh boy. If I said it's my

385
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:39,750
turn to use the xbox would you guys think that was funny? Oh I don't have one of those things on.

386
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:52,949
All right so I gotta get one of those arm uh augments. Come back over here. Into the

387
01:48:52,949 --> 01:48:59,500
middle of this thing. Use it. So I have this this key now. I can probably use that. Back down the

388
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:10,680
elevator. Use that in the red room. What side is this on? I don't even know where I came from. Over

389
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:39,909
here right? So this is the leftmost um pod right? Oh how do I get out of here? So then it would be

390
01:49:39,909 --> 01:50:12,300
the rightmost one. Is it this one? Oh shit. Okay hold on. Can I make for them? Whoa what happened there?

391
01:50:13,300 --> 01:51:14,460
Oh um I definitely have to turn that off. Oh pull them all. One two three. Got them all. All right

392
01:51:14,460 --> 01:52:29,189
cool. So that's a shortcut. That didn't work. Holy shit. Huh? All right that's weird. Oh he's just

393
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:50,060
ugh. Okay so I'm gonna go out of here. What can I do with this? I can go through the blades? Let's

394
01:52:50,060 --> 01:53:00,630
try that. I'm eating. I mean I'm I'm playing scorn but I am very overexposed over here.

395
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:22,300
Aren't I? I'm like look at them. They're bright. What's going on here? Is that better? Lights off.

396
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:40,140
Lights off but it'll look weird. Right? Is it gonna look weird? I turned the lights off and somehow

397
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:44,899
this is what happened. I don't understand what just happened. Why did this happen? Why did the

398
01:53:44,899 --> 01:54:17,539
webcam just break? Hold on. It's because like auto exposure. Um give me one second. Dude why does

399
01:54:17,539 --> 01:54:50,859
this look so fucked up now? Am I at 60 fps at least? Hold on. That's 2008 scorn playthrough.

400
01:54:50,859 --> 01:55:08,619
Um I don't I don't know why it's doing this. I guess I could do this. Why is it so frame ratey?

401
01:55:08,619 --> 01:55:16,300
Dude what is it with? Somebody explain this to me. What is it with webcams that they just they go to

402
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:24,920
2 fps if the like exposure is brought up. It's like does this thing only operate on an auto shutter

403
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:30,840
that can never be fucking overrided and you need like six floodlights to make it even look remotely

404
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:43,880
good looking. Why is it slowing the shutter speed? Just put the gamma up bro. Okay well this is

405
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:58,680
obviously not going to work. So let me go back to what this looked like before. I mean computers are

406
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:23,289
stupid. Why I'm like orange. Why am I so orange? All right that's better. That's that's a little

407
01:56:23,289 --> 01:56:32,250
creepier. Right? There. There you go. All right we're good. This is like scary lighting. Right?

408
01:56:33,659 --> 01:56:46,729
Okay let's go. You're still in the tutorial. I'm not in the tutorial actually. Is this quick

409
01:56:46,729 --> 01:57:01,000
size yet? This thing is so bright now I can't even see the screen. It's like oh my god. I

410
01:57:02,279 --> 01:57:27,100
just put like six lights in your face. Is this is a shitty frame rate? Is it that it's still okay?

411
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:43,270
We good? It's definitely shitty frame rate. I swear to god. I swear to god all these webcam

412
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:51,500
companies have not upgraded the technology since 2006. I promise you. I don't think they've updated

413
01:57:51,500 --> 01:58:05,420
the chips inside of these things since like 2007. I don't I don't think so. I don't think so. So

414
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:18,260
this is where I was. I want to go back out to where the fan is. Isn't it so weird that ever since I

415
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:26,470
got the that old like I got this this old Logitech webcam. I remember using it. It was like a C like

416
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:36,470
20 or something. Right? It looks identical to this. That was 10 fucking years ago. It was

417
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:52,970
literally 10 years ago. In fact it looked better. All right I'm gonna play. All right so here's this.

418
01:58:52,970 --> 01:59:14,520
This is a shortcut through the blades which puts me here. Okay so that is just an easy way to get

419
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:24,649
back to there. Right? So let's do this. Does this do anything for me? Didn't I already do this though?

420
01:59:24,649 --> 02:00:38,329
Wait what's going on? Why am I doing this again? Do I have to do this again? Stop. I mean you look

421
02:00:38,329 --> 02:00:44,409
like you're covered in cheeto dust. I don't know. This is a Logitech brio. I think this thing was

422
02:00:44,409 --> 02:01:07,340
a hundred fucking dollars. This thing was expensive. Okay so I got that. I don't know why this thing is

423
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:25,560
so bad. Okay so I can't go this way. So I have a new thing. Back to the red room. Right? So I'm

424
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:36,220
going to try to do. So let me go back here. Yeah I think I am just going to set up my that DSLR.

425
02:01:36,220 --> 02:02:05,859
Okay so I got that. Cool. Let's go here. What is that? Can I touch this? Oh nice. All right I

426
02:02:05,859 --> 02:02:34,090
got the thing now. Do you have an intentional orange filter on? Okay so this opens. This is

427
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:39,270
another shortcut. So I'm kind of just opening up this whole area which is good because now

428
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:48,470
do I need to do? No I did that one already. So I gotta go back to red room. Right? That's the idea.

429
02:02:48,470 --> 02:03:10,920
Okay red room. Red room was around the corner here. Where's the red room? Where's the red room? Down

430
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:34,920
here? Dad's over here. Okay. Can I like practice or something? All right. I have a new code. All

431
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:41,800
right. So I gotta get. There's another one. There's one more I gotta get. Yep. I gotta get

432
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:59,420
one more. What is the axe stream? You'll see. You'll see. Okay so very obviously I gotta get

433
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:06,600
one more of those and where the hell is that? That's a great question. So I'm missing one code

434
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:25,859
for my power glove. Whatever it is. Okay so where would that be? Probably up where I was

435
02:04:25,859 --> 02:04:33,300
because now I can wait. Uh-huh. I can go back. I have the thing for my arm. Let me see if I can

436
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:41,529
backtrack to where I was. I got the thing for my arm which I need that to go up this way. I got

437
02:04:41,529 --> 02:05:02,229
the thing on my arm. Right? And then I did that and this is the fan unplug. No. Wait. How do I get

438
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:23,529
back to? How do I get back to that area? The other elevator. Because I put my hand in this right? So

439
02:05:23,529 --> 02:05:43,939
now I can use the thing. Where were the fans dude? I just don't fucking remember. I just really don't.

440
02:05:44,020 --> 02:06:03,460
I feel like it was like no this is it in this way because that's the red room. This is going back.

441
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:27,180
This room which I don't think I'm supposed to be here. No. I need one more of these fucking things.

442
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:39,460
It's not this. But is it? All right give me help. Is this the red room elevator? Then it was not

443
02:06:39,460 --> 02:07:15,140
just up here? Tubes. Okay right so now I'm back up here. There's nothing over here. All right so

444
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:30,539
this is back up this way. Where would the other hand arm thing be? Back up through the tubes and

445
02:07:30,539 --> 02:07:56,180
then it was to the right wasn't it? It was the left. I thought I got spun around. Dude have you

446
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:16,390
been exposed to radiation? No dude I'm fine. All right so I did this one. I got that one. I can go

447
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:36,619
in this thing now. I can touch this. Right? Yeah. All right let's go. Let's go. I get it. Okay well

448
02:08:36,619 --> 02:09:07,319
um do it to the one that's blocked. Okay then go that way. I think that's the only one. I gotta go

449
02:09:07,319 --> 02:09:36,939
that way. Okay. Okay. I got a feeling it's gonna be right here. Remember do you think you have what it

450
02:09:36,939 --> 02:10:17,770
takes to be America's next top model? Yes. One more. Lock it in. Where's this one go? On here.

451
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:51,109
Wait for the click. Thank you. I know a thing or two. Okay so I got everything. It's time to get

452
02:10:51,109 --> 02:11:01,579
out of here. Time to turn on the red room uh and see what happens. I'm very interested. By the way

453
02:11:01,579 --> 02:11:10,250
make sure you get hype for the I'm going to dodge your battle act stream. Coming to you very soon.

454
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:24,220
Well relatively soon. All right so um I want to go over here right back down to the red room.

455
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:53,800
Okay here there's the red room. Back down. All right let's get the heck out of here. Bingo. All

456
02:11:53,800 --> 02:12:16,979
right what happens? Took me 40 minutes to do this shit. Oh what's that? You have to rev that up.

457
02:12:16,979 --> 02:12:46,140
Okay hold on. What is this? Interesting. All right turn it on. Um that's not gonna work. Um

458
02:13:26,569 --> 02:13:33,659
shit. Okay I'll be all right. Stop. It's a puzzle. You don't beat him instantly. Nobody opens this

459
02:13:33,739 --> 02:13:39,260
game. I'm sorry. Nobody does this. Everyone that's like oh my god. He has his brain.

460
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:49,380
Just hold on. You don't open this and go like. No it takes five minutes to do. It takes five

461
02:13:49,380 --> 02:14:28,140
minutes. See it takes five. It takes a few. That's difficult to do that. You don't just solve it

462
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:32,859
instantly. You don't solve a puzzle like that instantly. I don't. Nobody does that. I bet you

463
02:14:32,859 --> 02:14:56,069
half of you guys took 15 minutes to do that. I still have that thing attached to me. Oh geez.

464
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:25,939
Are you gonna get up? I think this person's gonna get up. All right I got some device. What is the

465
02:15:25,939 --> 02:15:37,079
device for? Does that open doors? All right that opens. Logitech Brio yellow color correction using

466
02:15:37,079 --> 02:15:50,890
OBS. I don't. Do I have to fix this right now? Hold on. I'm gonna fix this right now apparently.

467
02:15:50,890 --> 02:16:36,040
Well I'm into it. Let's go. Got it. Got it right. There it is. There it is. I'm good. Let's go. All

468
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:40,120
right so this is gonna open doors that have the symbol in the top left which I'm imagining is the

469
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:47,860
one upstairs right. The one that I walk by all the time. Let's wait is that up and over or is

470
02:16:47,860 --> 02:17:15,719
that over here? It's over here right? Right here. Okay. So what's in here? This seems creepy. Come

471
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:41,579
on the other side. Don't you think that would add some atmosphere if like after every major kind of

472
02:17:41,579 --> 02:17:47,700
area and every puzzle was like music played and you just heard it's going. That'd be kind of cool

473
02:17:47,700 --> 02:18:39,059
I think. Oh okay. I can open that door. What's over here? Weird. All right doesn't have a sword in

474
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:49,719
its hand. Okay crazy. All right let's go. You're doing well. I'm just having fun man. What's your

475
02:18:49,719 --> 02:19:05,420
opinion of garlic and onions? It pretty much makes any food better. That's just a fact. Who is

476
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:09,100
disagreeing with that opinion? I feel like that's the safest opinion you could possibly have.

477
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:16,100
In fact I don't think there's a safer opinion than saying that garlic is delicious. Garlic and

478
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:27,319
onions make things taste good. What a- that's not a thing you'd even disagree with. Oh shit this

479
02:19:27,319 --> 02:20:10,010
thing's moving. Get it out. Get it off of me. What do I do for it? I fill it with like blood?

480
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:36,500
Okay. I'm doing a lot of like internal burping this stream by the way. It's gross. This is

481
02:20:36,500 --> 02:22:10,579
important. I'm back. All right. Okay I got that whatever that is. Is there a filter on it?

482
02:22:10,579 --> 02:22:32,010
There shouldn't be. This is really creepy. All right I'm going around here. Oh my fucking god

483
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:37,290
give me a break. Are you kidding me? I've ruined everything. Jesus. God damn it. Fuck.

484
02:22:55,860 --> 02:23:10,389
That's fucking creepy. Come on. I'm actually pissed off right now. I'm truly- I'm not- I'm very

485
02:23:10,389 --> 02:23:16,950
unhappy. I didn't turn the stupid filter off and I see people saying filter filter. I thought

486
02:23:16,950 --> 02:24:14,629
you talked about the webcam. Whatever. Let's go. Jesus. All right open the door. Did I beat like

487
02:24:14,629 --> 02:24:47,690
the first zone here? I haven't seen anything else. All right I don't know. Okay interesting.

488
02:24:47,690 --> 02:25:07,690
Let's go straight ahead. Okay there's a light right here. Very cool. Jesus. Oh what the fuck?

489
02:25:09,049 --> 02:25:54,840
Did I get a new power? Oh this is a new power. I can open up doors that have that. Okay so let me

490
02:25:54,840 --> 02:26:27,049
commit this to memory here. So I have two keys technically I think right. What's down here?

491
02:26:27,049 --> 02:26:36,219
Blood. Lots of fucking blood. Lots of blood. That's a lot of blood. I have to be better at

492
02:26:36,219 --> 02:26:41,530
fucking acting. I have to be way better at acting. Oh I need to move this. I need to be a fucking

493
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:58,260
better actor. All right so I just walked in a circle. Nothing over there. So I gotta get down

494
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:14,600
here. Oh all right I got that. I can probably move this somehow. Was there a door that I walked by?

495
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:45,559
Maybe. Oh I couldn't go this way. I'm sorry I can't do it. The problem is I can't see where the

496
02:27:45,559 --> 02:27:51,639
board is right. So I have to put my arm over here without looking and press the button and it's I

497
02:27:51,639 --> 02:28:02,780
can't. I need to I need to put this somewhere else and where I can like just I can't fuck this

498
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:11,700
up anymore. I gotta stop doing this routine for a few minutes. It would make sense if I wasn't

499
02:28:17,899 --> 02:28:27,100
Okay I gotta find that button and it's right there. Right there. From here. Right there. Okay I

500
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:51,110
got it. Can I actually not go down anywhere from here? Where am I supposed to go? Because this

501
02:28:51,110 --> 02:29:03,670
just wraps back around. I have a second key. I guess over here I could go. I mean didn't I already

502
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:31,260
do this? This is the elevator. I can't go back up. What's the one place I didn't go this way?

503
02:29:31,260 --> 02:30:05,100
Like over here? Did I not go over here? Oh okay yeah yep yep yep we're good. I have to kill this

504
02:30:05,100 --> 02:31:14,149
thing. Oh jeez. All right these things are alive. Is it alive? Fucking scary. Uh hello.

505
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:31,030
What the hell? Why can I not attack?

506
02:31:42,250 --> 02:32:35,379
That was. You dead? Geez. Okay so that's that. Why would I do this twice? I wouldn't keep it there.

507
02:32:35,379 --> 02:32:43,620
So now I go up and I can. Okay so I have to move this one. Does this one have a thing?

508
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:21,450
Now I just need to get up there. Elevator right and walk through. I have to actually start fighting

509
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:52,020
enemies now. This is gonna be rough. Stop! Stop! Ow! Okay that's so you can kill them pretty

510
02:33:52,020 --> 02:34:12,280
instantly then. Up here I need to get to that walkway. Which is it right here? Is the walkway

511
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:23,260
right here? I don't know. I think so. And I walk this way. Yeah one and then two but wait a second.

512
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:36,729
I already got that. Press E to heal. Are you serious? Oh my god you're not a liar. I thought

513
02:34:36,729 --> 02:35:11,739
you lied. I don't think I. Is it a full heal? This is fucking hurting me. What? This is actually

514
02:35:11,739 --> 02:35:54,299
hurting me. This thing is still killing me. I'm gonna have to be able to get this thing off right?

515
02:35:54,299 --> 02:35:57,260
I'm gonna sit in the like a meek grinder machine and this thing's gonna get.

516
02:35:57,979 --> 02:36:27,479
A blade's gonna go under its back. Okay oh boy. Okay oh no no no don't dark souls me please. Oh

517
02:36:27,479 --> 02:37:06,059
my god give me a fucking break. Yeah okay get me please get me back the other way. What do we have

518
02:37:06,059 --> 02:38:02,700
here on the machine? I think about that felt weird. I hated that. In the head. In the head. In the head.

519
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:10,069
In the head. In the head. In the head. Directly in the head please. Why is it not grabbing?

520
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:44,090
How come I can't grab it? It's fucking. Why can I not hit him in the head? You just got a rare

521
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:57,750
animation. Wait I have to do this all over again? Oh god damn it. All right I'm not gonna fuck it

522
02:38:57,750 --> 02:39:44,229
up. It's not that. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'll be fine. Heal. How do I get out of here?

523
02:39:46,010 --> 02:40:54,899
I just wanted to leave the globe. Pull this. All right we're good. Dermot your mother's watching

524
02:40:54,899 --> 02:41:03,350
the streams. Don't waste her time. My mother would probably open the stream and go what is he doing?

525
02:41:03,350 --> 02:41:05,270
What is this? And she would leave.

526
02:41:23,180 --> 02:41:34,020
Dude what does the bar on the right side even mean? Oh it's a stamina bar. Okay I thought it

527
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:37,620
was a stamina bar but it was hard to even tell where the bar was. All right so you can do it

528
02:41:37,620 --> 02:42:10,100
twice. Is there a block or anything? Can I pull the thing up? Okay so that's my health bar. Wait

529
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:17,079
okay the top row is the amount of heals that I have and the all right so the squares are actual

530
02:42:17,079 --> 02:42:44,120
health. The thing's much bigger than the other ones. I don't think I can do anything with that

531
02:42:44,120 --> 02:43:07,190
right now. It's scary. I don't want to get overwhelmed here. This is this is a huge area

532
02:43:10,389 --> 02:43:18,200
so let's do this slow and do this right. I'm gonna go this way first and I'm gonna go up. Oh I'm gonna

533
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:47,110
get so fucking lost here. I'm gonna get so lost. There's gonna be a big ball there. Okay so there's

534
02:43:47,110 --> 02:44:03,079
gonna be a huge ball that I have to get on that. So that's a good place to start. Okay so let me go

535
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:28,469
over there I think. Sure yeah it sounds right. The track here. All right so this is a uh for a

536
02:44:28,469 --> 02:44:41,559
teleported ball. What's on the other side? Okay one of these. Oh no that I thought that was a machine.

537
02:44:41,559 --> 02:44:57,559
No it's not. All right there's nothing over here. All right let's go. Who just said what's the point?

538
02:44:57,559 --> 02:45:03,459
I don't know of why would I why am I playing this because it's uh it's halloween time. What's the

539
02:45:03,459 --> 02:45:22,200
point? Oh wait a minute it's new it just came out. This was a pretty hyped up game from what I

540
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:35,819
remember. Didn't I what we watched the e3 trailer or something right? All right where am I? We did

541
02:45:35,819 --> 02:46:05,319
I think we did yeah. Is that the thing I needed to grab? Oh please please don't.

542
02:46:05,319 --> 02:47:21,260
I have this more to do. I think I have to bring it all the way up. Oh health refill. Cool. So this can hold two charges and each charge is four health.

543
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:34,100
Totally eight health. All right what else is here? Anything interesting to do still? Anything at all?

544
02:47:34,100 --> 02:49:00,459
There's probably a few of them. Oh you're dead? Stop I can't move. What's up with your face today?

545
02:49:00,459 --> 02:49:50,340
I don't know. Oh did I do anything with this or just it's just annoying and in the way? Hey

546
02:49:50,340 --> 02:50:20,760
why does he only read mean messages? No I've read some nice ones. All right so now bring this all

547
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:43,579
the way up and then I can go pick it up. Wow I gotta turn it down. All right so that's all

548
02:50:43,579 --> 02:51:06,280
the way up there now. Two oh shit. I don't have invincibility when I'm doing that to someone.

549
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:40,840
Shoot. We're good. It's all the way up. I think I just need to grab it with the uh the big claw hand

550
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:49,209
right? Because I think that's what I have to do. I'm out of I know I have a little bit I've got more.

551
02:51:49,209 --> 02:52:19,579
I'll get to full health. Snore? Don't even. Don't don't even. Don't even. Don't even start. Don't even.

552
02:52:19,579 --> 02:52:40,889
Okay now uh do I do now? I guess I can I don't know. I'm gonna activate this. Oh that's giving me an

553
02:52:40,889 --> 02:53:03,209
area to go. I'm gonna go that way just to see what oh I can't wait just moving on its own.

554
02:53:03,209 --> 02:53:15,139
This shit's moving on its own. So now I'm imagining I get in and then go down or get in and just run

555
02:53:15,139 --> 02:53:50,680
across. I think we're gonna are we gonna see the end of this arc here? No. What is the end of that

556
02:53:50,680 --> 02:54:03,129
arc? I definitely get it ripped off of me right? I have to. Yeah right there. I'm gonna sit in this

557
02:54:03,129 --> 02:54:23,639
I'm gonna sit in this and it's gonna take it off of me. Watch this. What am I looking at? I don't

558
02:54:23,639 --> 02:54:46,340
know what I'm I don't know what that does. That's cool. All right this thing's coming off. Ammo. Oh

559
02:54:46,340 --> 02:55:09,500
I have all right cool. So weird. All right so this thing's loaded. Probably gonna be using it right

560
02:55:09,500 --> 02:56:36,549
now to shoot something. Yep. Stop. Score. Cool. Now this looks interesting over here. It doesn't do

561
02:56:36,549 --> 02:56:53,850
it. That's not it? How's that not it? How am I supposed to get that to go? There's not enough

562
02:56:53,850 --> 02:57:23,430
pieces. There's not enough pieces to do this. I mean do I need another piece or something? I don't

563
02:57:23,430 --> 02:57:38,200
get it. I had all three of them lit up. All right the only time I can light this one up is if it's

564
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:47,430
touching the one on the right side here. That's the only time the middle one lights up. No. So what

565
02:57:47,430 --> 02:58:34,309
is making it do that? I got it. That was weird. Score. All right this is goes into the elevator

566
02:58:34,309 --> 02:58:49,909
upstairs. Oh no I gotta do this again. I gotta do that again. It's gonna be harder next time.

567
02:58:49,909 --> 02:59:10,540
Please. Um okay. I'm going. Let's go down. So I need to put the you know what I'm saying? I gotta

568
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:14,219
put the thing in to go down another level or should I just go down with it right now?

569
02:59:16,069 --> 02:59:27,459
Should I go and put the thing in or should I just go down to that second level?

570
02:59:27,459 --> 02:59:46,229
Get more ammo? Uh I think this is only one use. Yeah I can't get any more. I'm just gonna try

571
02:59:46,229 --> 02:59:56,420
going down. How come these aliens build their spaceship with a bunch of annoying puzzles?

572
03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:09,590
Well think about it. If an alien landed here and you told them to get in a car and go drive on

573
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:16,469
go go anywhere on like a highway they'd be like what the fuck is all this? What's this weird system

574
03:00:16,469 --> 03:00:23,420
of lines that you have to go on with this thing? They'd say the same shit. Our highway systems

575
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:37,139
would confuse the fuck out of an alien. So I mean is this the equivalent? Probably. I need that.

576
03:00:37,139 --> 03:01:09,459
There it is. So what should I put in the middle one? Puzzle complete. Is he okay? Better than

577
03:01:09,459 --> 03:01:52,790
ever. All right go down. Do that other puzzle right here. Very cool. Very cool. Hey dude you are

578
03:01:52,790 --> 03:02:02,200
making me angry. Uh oh. How do I get more weapons? Can I do it? I can't. Where's my other gun?

579
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:13,770
Uh oh this is bad. Um I don't I can't reload. There's nothing in the gun.

580
03:02:13,770 --> 03:02:43,190
Do I even need to kill any of this shit honestly? Press one. Oh oh my god okay I was doing mouse

581
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:48,649
scroll. I was trying to scroll for new weapons but it's just okay I got it. Cool. Cool. That's

582
03:02:48,649 --> 03:03:09,370
weird. Is it gonna melt? This is a weird request. Dude can you do Alex Jones stuck in the scorn world?

583
03:03:11,579 --> 03:03:31,180
How what how somebody is next to me right now. Let me figure this out first because this is

584
03:03:31,180 --> 03:03:54,139
gonna take me a little bit. All right I can turn this one. Oh fuck the whole thing has to be done.

585
03:03:54,139 --> 03:05:34,440
No no no no no no. Okay hold on. You gotta just get them all matched up.

586
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:55,209
How do I get them to turn together? Oh that's how. All right hold on. I gotta turn this how

587
03:05:55,209 --> 03:06:37,719
many times? Like two more times? One two three four that. Okay so now oh I'm so goddamn close man.

588
03:06:38,360 --> 03:07:18,600
So I need to keep this uh yeah. Scorn. Okay cool. Now I go go back put this in and go all the way

589
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:35,100
down. This guy's supposed to dodge a battle axe. A puzzle is a video game puzzle is not even close

590
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:47,370
to comparing me dodging a battle axe. They're two completely different. Oh whatever. Just run.

591
03:07:50,870 --> 03:08:08,739
It's basically the same thing. No it's not. It's not even close. Are you gonna practice for the

592
03:08:08,739 --> 03:08:20,149
battle axe stream? Practice what? Do you think I need practice? I don't I couldn't I don't think

593
03:08:20,149 --> 03:08:26,229
you know who the fuck you're talking to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hold on. I'm sorry. That was

594
03:08:27,030 --> 03:08:49,370
let me let me cool it off a little. Let me cool it off a little. Do you know who I am? Do you have

595
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:54,969
any idea who I am? Do you know who you're talking to? You think I can't dodge a battle axe? Oh okay.

596
03:08:55,610 --> 03:09:07,579
Sorry I'm gonna cool off and I forget where I'm going. I knew I had to go up to go to that device

597
03:09:07,579 --> 03:09:23,639
to put the third plug in. Um I forget where that is. Oh you have any idea who you're talking to?

598
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:46,739
I need where is this machine thing? It's up here somewhere over there. It's across the way right?

599
03:09:46,739 --> 03:09:52,389
Did I go did I run by it? I mean I'm sorry I'm looking at chat people are telling me to do an

600
03:09:52,389 --> 03:10:14,100
Alex Jones impression. I'm trying to pay attention to this fucking puzzle game. Okay here this is not

601
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:39,459
it. Where is this thing? It's right there. Jesus. How do I get over there? Wait what? How the fuck

602
03:10:39,459 --> 03:10:58,659
do I get over there? Other way was the oh god you were just there? It's right it's right here. How

603
03:10:58,659 --> 03:11:08,469
do I get over there? Oh my god I was already over there. All right. All right. No it started. I'm

604
03:11:08,469 --> 03:11:22,540
not doing Alex Jones ever again. No I'm not doing Alex Jones ever again. In fact yeah you're gonna

605
03:11:22,540 --> 03:11:29,989
get punished with a Stewie Griffin impression. That's what you get. You're gonna get punished

606
03:11:29,989 --> 03:12:25,139
with a Stewie Griffin. Here it comes. I say Ryan. What? Then we go down all the way. Most streamers

607
03:12:25,139 --> 03:12:38,540
don't punish their viewers. I'm I'm punishing you with a Stewie Griffin voice. I think I think it's

608
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:57,899
gonna be okay. All right everything has been done. Now I have to grab the ball. What's down here?

609
03:12:57,899 --> 03:13:11,350
Nothing. I have complete I have uh wait did I explore down here completely? I think I did

610
03:13:11,350 --> 03:13:24,680
right. Is there anything else to do down here? I mean I could just turn this on. Will this get

611
03:13:24,680 --> 03:14:26,819
the thing I need? All right we'll get it. Okay so what did that do? Can I get in? Oh now I can grab

612
03:14:26,819 --> 03:15:02,090
this and take it over here. Uh all right um now what? Uh I think there's another ball to grab here.

613
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:14,379
You're doing great. Oh thanks. Funny when he starts doing a bit and you can tell when he gets

614
03:15:14,379 --> 03:15:22,809
completely distracted from whatever he's doing in the game. Yes that happens very frequently

615
03:15:22,809 --> 03:15:31,639
because my problem is I don't stop moving right. I don't stop moving. Usually when I start talking

616
03:15:31,639 --> 03:15:36,440
I look in the chat. I'm just I'm just walking right. Just walking straight and turning corners

617
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:40,760
and stuff. So what I disconnect from the game when I'm talking to you but I'm still moving.

618
03:15:41,559 --> 03:15:46,149
So I need to just take my hands off the keyboard when I start to talk and then oh I'm still in

619
03:15:46,149 --> 03:16:05,370
the same spot. Okay I can kind of get and plant back in. All right so what does this do? Nothing.

620
03:16:05,370 --> 03:16:37,930
Okay um should I just go in here? Ball ball ball gg gg there's no ball. What do you mean gg?

621
03:17:27,059 --> 03:17:43,350
Now I'm gonna go down and then I'm gonna it's gonna grab it out of this hand it off right.

622
03:17:43,350 --> 03:17:58,969
Can I just hand it off? Can I drop this here? Oh all right nice very nice. So now we got

623
03:18:01,930 --> 03:18:19,430
two balls over here. Looks good. All right I'm gonna get in this one but not yet. What is the

624
03:18:19,430 --> 03:18:38,940
point of this one? I guess I could bring it. Where am I gonna bring this? I guess that makes sense

625
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:48,979
and then I go in that. All right um let me just check back here because I don't want to miss

626
03:18:48,979 --> 03:18:55,340
anything. Did I go down here yet? I don't think I did. There's an alien down here of course I didn't.

627
03:18:55,340 --> 03:19:30,219
Oh this thing's dead. Did I go down here? Did I come down here? Oh I did yeah this is where that

628
03:19:30,219 --> 03:19:58,620
thing was crawling around over here. All right I'm going back up. I've been down here. I just dodged

629
03:19:58,620 --> 03:20:29,030
so much. Why am I even fighting you? What are you what are you doing? Get it off. So I'm gonna go

630
03:20:29,030 --> 03:21:08,139
in that ball. I think that completes this section. Interesting. I need ammo again with this monster.

631
03:21:15,379 --> 03:21:29,639
Wait that's hurting me every time. Really? Can that thing actually kill you and just

632
03:21:29,639 --> 03:22:13,260
softlock you in the game? I'm assuming yes. Oh thank god. Oh all right another one of these

633
03:22:13,260 --> 03:22:28,979
which I probably have to drop all of them. Okay what? Can I not go this way? Okay I can't go that

634
03:22:28,979 --> 03:23:05,450
way. So what? Okay I've already been here. Shit. All right how do I get down there?

635
03:23:06,409 --> 03:23:17,819
Can't go that way. Do I have to do something with this? This game reminds me of seafood.

636
03:23:22,579 --> 03:24:03,510
Weird. Um I'm gonna go this way and down. Whatever. Not even gonna give you a chance.

637
03:24:03,510 --> 03:24:45,579
Um oh I can't move. Wait should I stay in here? I feel like I'm okay. Okay it doesn't move. These

638
03:24:45,579 --> 03:24:49,979
guys probably jump off and follow you around. I'm gonna kill them every time I see them.

639
03:24:51,850 --> 03:25:29,139
Yeah what's that? This is gonna be such a huge pain in the ass I can already tell.

640
03:25:29,139 --> 03:25:34,420
I gotta move all these. When I move one of these gates another gate closes in a different place

641
03:25:34,420 --> 03:26:11,979
and then oh shit there's a new enemy. Oh dude it's a new scorn like game. That was a good one. How

642
03:26:11,979 --> 03:26:27,940
far back am I? Scorn like game. I'm about that far back right? No. No not really at all. All right

643
03:26:27,940 --> 03:26:46,520
let's keep going. Shut up. I don't want to shoot you but I'm- oh my god the little shit enemy killed

644
03:26:46,520 --> 03:27:03,290
me. How many takes of this did I do? Scorn. Scorn. Scorn. That one doesn't have any effects on it at

645
03:27:03,290 --> 03:27:24,280
all. That was just a guy. Scorn. That would probably be annoying after a while. I think I have- no I

646
03:27:24,280 --> 03:27:48,100
don't. Just kill it. It's not annoying. Yes it is. I know it is. All right now let's get ready.

647
03:27:48,100 --> 03:27:58,280
This thing falls. Oh look out. Okay we're good. It doesn't go anywhere. This is where the enemy is.

648
03:27:58,280 --> 03:28:15,110
I got a full clip. Okay turn this on. I need health. Bad. Let me check over here first.

649
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:24,889
It's probably health or something right? There's really nothing over here.

650
03:28:26,489 --> 03:28:48,229
Dude what is that sound? No there's nothing here. Okay let's try this again. Hopefully I don't die

651
03:28:48,229 --> 03:29:03,559
because I'm going to start over. Very saturated. Yeah. Have you considered reloading? I got a- I

652
03:29:03,559 --> 03:29:22,700
have a full magazine. All right here we go. Here it comes. All right let's go. All right.

653
03:29:28,440 --> 03:30:02,620
Shut up. Shut up. I'm fine. Scorn. I have to do that whole thing again. How am I gonna- nice

654
03:30:02,620 --> 03:30:17,370
indie filter. I need health. I don't have any health potions or anything. If I get hit once I'm

655
03:30:17,370 --> 03:30:25,940
dead. All right I just have to- I can't run in the hallway. He'll kill me if I run down the hall.

656
03:30:35,059 --> 03:30:59,610
Go go go go. I know where I'm going. Come on. Just watch this hall. Okay so I'm gonna just

657
03:30:59,610 --> 03:31:09,940
do this and then run away because I will just- I'm gonna just run him around this circle. He

658
03:31:09,940 --> 03:31:41,670
has to follow the same pathing rules that I do. There he is. All right. Get out of this tunnel.

659
03:32:10,280 --> 03:32:23,540
Thought I could stagger him enough times. Don't just run. Don't try to kill it. Really?

660
03:32:25,209 --> 03:32:38,729
Yeah. Don't be greedy. I was under the impression that if I shot it in the head it moves around and

661
03:32:38,729 --> 03:32:51,420
I can shoot it like four or five times. It was my mistake. Okay let's try this again. Look I can die

662
03:32:51,420 --> 03:33:27,000
in one hit anyway. I'm seriously- I'm just rushing now to get through this. Yeah I know. Come on.

663
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:49,049
Come on. Yeah whatever. Okay I'm going to just run away. I'm not gonna fight. I'm gonna just run.

664
03:33:49,610 --> 03:33:56,469
I'm not gonna waste ammo. I'm not gonna waste an entire magazine on this shit. Where is the

665
03:33:56,549 --> 03:34:02,389
path I need to take? Through here and then I want to just wrap around.

666
03:34:05,110 --> 03:34:13,989
Pretend every enemy is a battleaxe. Well I'm not actually moving to get out of the way.

667
03:34:18,709 --> 03:34:24,299
All right. Where am I? How do I get out of here? What's the correct way to go?

668
03:34:24,860 --> 03:34:33,780
I think I have to go that way. All right let's run you around. Yeah I actually have to go

669
03:34:33,780 --> 03:34:47,219
where he came from. All right that was much easier than- he's not still behind me right?

670
03:34:51,129 --> 03:36:42,709
Oh let's do something. Move. I'm gonna get up. Oh thank god. Do I have this? I don't. I need the

671
03:36:42,709 --> 03:37:04,700
other piece. Where is it? Don't- don't come at me please. Don't just doom three but it's awesome.

672
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:16,299
I mean it's really really cool. The atmosphere of the game alone is worth playing I think.

673
03:37:16,299 --> 03:37:23,909
I don't know honestly much else to say besides that but I mean that's carrying the whole game

674
03:37:23,909 --> 03:37:29,590
for me right now. This is like how weird and interesting this place is. All right I'm gonna

675
03:37:29,590 --> 03:37:44,170
die in one hit down there. I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna shoot this guy. He hates it. He loves it.

676
03:37:45,610 --> 03:38:07,909
I have to give my full assessment. Where are you? You're just fucking around. Are you gonna get up

677
03:38:07,909 --> 03:38:54,139
if I- I mean I die in one hit so okay. This way. Dude if I would have just let you in

678
03:38:54,700 --> 03:39:19,940
I would have just let this thing in. Oh god. Oh wait oh goodness. Oh thank goodness.

679
03:39:20,579 --> 03:39:30,600
Okay we're good. Is this health? What is this? Oh it's the key. Is this health? This is ammo.

680
03:39:31,540 --> 03:39:42,100
I need- oh shit. Can I get more? All right well I guess I'll just fill the whole thing.

681
03:39:42,100 --> 03:39:55,530
This should be enough for another view at least. That's good. Let me get the key and then I have

682
03:39:55,530 --> 03:40:07,219
to go back through that. It's gonna be annoying. How do I get back there? This is a disaster.

683
03:40:07,940 --> 03:41:03,139
I'm just gonna run. Don't go down there. Okay and then it's this way and then I think I'm kind of

684
03:41:03,139 --> 03:41:13,850
lost. I think it's this way and up to get to that door. He's not gonna follow me all the way over

685
03:41:13,850 --> 03:41:34,280
here right? I don't- I don't remember. It's up. That's all I remember is up. I think I have to

686
03:41:34,360 --> 03:41:41,610
plug in this thing. Yeah where are you going? I don't- I'm trying to backtrack back to where

687
03:41:41,610 --> 03:42:01,479
that door was. I think it's this way. I hope I'm right. Is this wrong? This is too far back.

688
03:42:10,409 --> 03:42:23,590
That was right. No no no no that is right. Wait what? You scorned too much dude. It is right.

689
03:42:23,590 --> 03:42:34,139
Is the dev in chat? Is it right? Can the dev tell me what's right? Dude you scorned too much.

690
03:42:44,950 --> 03:43:03,879
Oh I went too far. Did I go? Help. I actually want help. Backseat me please. It's too far back.

691
03:43:06,520 --> 03:44:11,079
Okay. Too far back. Phew. Are we doing good? Yes. My scornometer is low. I can help you out

692
03:44:11,079 --> 03:44:26,979
there in a minute. Oh thank goodness. I'm gonna leave it at that. Full ammo. Pretty much full

693
03:44:26,979 --> 03:44:54,809
health and on to the next area. Looks like I am gonna heal again. How's the audio? Are we good?

694
03:44:54,809 --> 03:45:49,780
Are the levels good today? It's this way. Huge guy. Okay huge guy. Check over here. Hey! You know

695
03:45:49,780 --> 03:46:09,420
what? Oh there's two things over there. Oh my jeff. I've had enough of that bullshit.

696
03:46:28,600 --> 03:46:47,139
This is really expanding here. This is going a long way. I don't even remember where. I gotta

697
03:46:47,139 --> 03:47:34,360
go all the way back for stuff maybe? I don't know. Okay. Oh shit. Um okay. This way? I guess. Hey

698
03:47:34,360 --> 03:47:37,479
Jerma I'm the creator of scorn. Just wanted you to know the easiest way to complete the game.

699
03:47:38,040 --> 03:49:31,899
All right. Music just changed. What is that thing? Oh my god. I'm not gonna. Am I? No I'm not.

700
03:49:32,459 --> 03:50:02,229
Who's responsible for this? Yous?

701
03:50:11,190 --> 03:51:00,520
You're still. Ah! You're gonna stop me from doing this? I'm just going in. Oh all right. I'm in. I

702
03:51:00,520 --> 03:51:22,120
made it. I made it. I'm good. I'm good. Is that a map? It's like where I. No it's a puzzle. Okay.

703
03:51:22,120 --> 03:52:06,250
I'm going back up. Ah! I'm fine. Am I going the right way? I don't know. Come here. Come here.

704
03:52:06,250 --> 03:52:37,379
Come here. Come here. That thing is terrifying. All right. What a weird thing. I hope I'm going

705
03:52:37,379 --> 03:53:01,270
the right way. Is this right? I don't know. Oh what's that sound? Oh it's one of those things.

706
03:53:01,270 --> 03:53:20,100
Okay all right. I'm good. Would you ever play this in VR? That would be horrifying. Go that way

707
03:53:20,260 --> 03:54:16,340
too. Boy. Oh! Health. It has hands. How much health do I have? Let's take one. Okay so now I can

708
03:54:17,059 --> 03:54:45,530
go down. Oh my goodness. They're everywhere. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.

709
03:54:46,090 --> 03:55:06,620
Die already. All right. We're good. I need four dots to get in here. This game so looks so cool.

710
03:55:06,620 --> 03:55:20,809
It really does. It's. All right. I. It's good. It's very good. But I don't know how good.

711
03:55:21,989 --> 03:55:42,250
Does that make any sense? So now I got to get back down. I think I have to walk just straight

712
03:55:42,250 --> 03:56:15,319
down right? Down here. Jeez. All right. Now what? Dude. Now what? What am I like turn? Am I turning

713
03:56:15,319 --> 03:57:10,180
into something? All right. Here comes the puzzle. This is impossible. This is not possible. Oh.

714
03:57:40,920 --> 03:58:17,059
Um. I mean this is where I came from. Isn't it? I missed the hallway back here. Did I? The puzzle

715
03:58:17,059 --> 03:58:43,290
room down here in the bottom layer. I mean like here. Um. I didn't go over here. Right. Well I

716
03:58:43,290 --> 03:58:57,459
can't go that way. Did I go both directions here? I can't go over there. Did I go this way? Yeah. I

717
03:58:57,459 --> 03:59:10,059
can't go over this way. All right. Um. I don't. I don't get it. If I can't do that maze puzzle.

718
03:59:10,059 --> 03:59:36,520
I'm gonna. I'm gonna say go down. Hmm. Like down here. I don't have one of those. This is a new

719
03:59:36,520 --> 03:59:59,079
weapon. What is this? This is like a shotgun. Cool. Oh the middle ones are shotgun. The outer

720
03:59:59,079 --> 04:00:07,049
ones are pistol. So I must have all the weapons in the game now right? Yeah. I have to. I have

721
04:00:07,049 --> 04:00:14,520
all the weapons in the game. This is the. I don't want to use this frequently. Although let me

722
04:00:14,520 --> 04:00:39,159
reload it. Three shots. Good to go. Good to go. Let's go this way. Can't go that way. So let's

723
04:00:39,159 --> 04:00:48,579
go over here. Well I'm gonna use it because if there's a time to use it it's right now.

724
04:00:51,899 --> 04:01:27,799
Two shots to kill the big guys. You got it. Okay. Where are you?

725
04:01:43,819 --> 04:02:26,360
Where are you? I'm moving so slow. Holy shit. I'm moving one mile per hour when I reload.

726
04:02:26,360 --> 04:03:00,340
You made me cry today. I'm sorry. Whatever. I didn't do anything. What about the time that you

727
04:03:00,340 --> 04:03:30,659
made me cry today? Jeremy you're stupid. You didn't do the puzzle fast enough. Stupid. Oh yes. So good

728
04:03:30,659 --> 04:03:35,370
luck trying to remember where the hell all these were. I know where this one is. It's right here.

729
04:03:35,370 --> 04:03:50,940
It looks like I only got two more bubbles. How close am I to the end of the game? The last third

730
04:03:50,940 --> 04:04:08,420
or something. Two more bubbles can fit and I have all the weapons. You're close. Two bubbles. I think

731
04:04:08,420 --> 04:04:27,719
I'm alive. Oh it was a shortcut back. All right. So where were those two? I already got that. Okay

732
04:04:27,719 --> 04:04:38,489
looking for the door of the bubble doors. Wasn't there a bubble door up here? I feel like there is.

733
04:04:38,489 --> 04:05:37,909
Right. Where's the bubble door? This way. I'm going in. All right. Can I do this one? No. Oh that's

734
04:05:37,909 --> 04:05:44,969
the- I gotta get all three of them up there. I get it. All right. So how do I go? I gotta go to the

735
04:05:44,969 --> 04:05:51,319
other bubble door and come down. All right. I know. I know. I'm going. Here we go. There's another

736
04:05:51,319 --> 04:06:07,500
bubble door. Where is that bubble door? Is it straight down? It's all the way over here right?

737
04:06:07,500 --> 04:06:25,530
Is it on this floor? Can you please say bubble door ten times fast? Bubble door. Bubble door.

738
04:06:25,530 --> 04:06:31,319
Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Hold on. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble

739
04:06:31,319 --> 04:06:34,360
door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door.

740
04:06:34,360 --> 04:06:38,569
I can do it a few times. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble

741
04:06:38,569 --> 04:06:48,489
door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Is it a handful of times? It's not this way. Is it all the way

742
04:06:48,489 --> 04:07:24,360
up or down? I don't remember. I think it's over here. It's down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down.

743
04:07:24,920 --> 04:07:40,950
Far left. Um yeah but I mean I uh far left from where? Like from where I'm standing right now

744
04:07:40,950 --> 04:07:55,610
this way? Like this way left? Because there's nothing here. I swear to god I saw it. Where?

745
04:07:55,610 --> 04:08:09,000
I gotta get around there. I have to keep going down. Down. Down. Down. Down. How do I get down

746
04:08:09,000 --> 04:08:19,799
from here? How do I get down from here? Can I go down from here? I think I can get down here right?

747
04:08:19,799 --> 04:08:37,000
Can I get there from here? No I can't get there from here. This is all blocked off. Um and there's

748
04:08:37,000 --> 04:08:59,540
nothing this way. Ceiling? Down around here? It's not this way right? Yeah scream at me if I'm going

749
04:08:59,540 --> 04:09:18,840
too far the wrong direction because I genuinely don't fucking know where I'm going. Um is it though?

750
04:09:19,399 --> 04:09:53,690
It is isn't it? Yeah. I wish I had like a fucking compass. All right so from here I have to be down

751
04:09:53,690 --> 04:10:09,879
you're saying. How do I get all the way down here? Can I go this way? And then backwards? No? And then

752
04:10:09,879 --> 04:10:25,930
down this way and then around and backwards? Oh there it is okay. Score! I was gonna press it but

753
04:10:49,829 --> 04:11:04,969
oh okay. Wasn't there a huge guy over here? I distinctly remember a huge guy. Can we see

754
04:11:04,969 --> 04:11:27,659
the other side? That's like a shortcut back. All right so what do I do now? All right I open that.

755
04:11:27,659 --> 04:11:56,659
Okay shotgun please. Geez. Candy corn? If candy corn had 30% less flavor I'd like it. All right I

756
04:11:56,659 --> 04:12:03,819
got health. I'm out of ammo though that's bad. I have zero ammo. I hope I don't have to kill

757
04:12:03,819 --> 04:12:19,739
anything because that would not work out. Um there's another one of these I can activate back there.

758
04:12:19,739 --> 04:13:00,489
I wonder which one it is. All right let's open it. Why are you playing this like an E3 demo?

759
04:13:06,059 --> 04:13:18,739
Uh am I? No I'm not. Why? Is it because of the amount of times I've gone? Okay so okay.

760
04:13:22,579 --> 04:13:27,049
That's why. It's because the amount of times that I've done something and gone.

761
04:13:28,819 --> 04:13:37,959
Okay. All right so I think we're going left. What do you want? You want to be quiet? Would

762
04:13:37,959 --> 04:13:46,459
you want me to not say a word? Fine I'll give you the anti-E3 playthrough.

763
04:14:26,739 --> 04:14:44,420
This is unfair. Unfair horse shit. That's unfair dog shit. I better not be far away. Please don't

764
04:14:44,420 --> 04:14:59,350
put me far away. This is not bad. What the fuck? Okay whatever just go. So I have to fight two

765
04:14:59,350 --> 04:15:21,350
huge things. Okay good to know. Take the shotgun out. It's two dodge two. I could also run. I'm

766
04:15:21,350 --> 04:15:29,690
gonna run. Is there anything else over here to do? Nope. Go run. I forgot you go one mile per I can't.

767
04:15:43,379 --> 04:15:54,360
Ah go go go go go up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up

768
04:15:54,360 --> 04:16:35,850
hurry hurry go go go go go. I'm good. Another super hard section. Did I miss? Oh my god.

769
04:16:35,850 --> 04:16:40,469
Are you still alive?

770
04:17:21,079 --> 04:17:31,270
All right time to go complete this. Good luck remembering how they get how to get back there.

771
04:17:31,909 --> 04:18:01,590
Can you just help me? Wait what from here? Where do I go? All right I got it. Thank you.

772
04:18:01,590 --> 04:18:12,459
So now the machine is over here. Right yes. All right it's time. It's time to be time to complete

773
04:18:12,459 --> 04:18:37,239
a puzzle. Go out that way. All right let's go. How does this work? I I don't I don't understand

774
04:18:37,239 --> 04:19:00,340
what's happening. Oh I do understand what's happening. All right. Okay wait I need to get

775
04:19:00,340 --> 04:19:08,180
it up. Okay where do I have to get it? It's got to be up the top. How do I get it up there?

776
04:20:01,049 --> 04:20:12,090
How do I get it up in the two slots above where I need to go? You know what I mean? I I can't move.

777
04:20:12,090 --> 04:20:18,700
I there's nowhere for me to put the ball. Even up there I wouldn't be able to connect it.

778
04:20:24,139 --> 04:20:29,780
So the ball is staying in the same place but it's three different mazes. But the issue is

779
04:20:29,780 --> 04:20:36,389
how do I get the ball up to the top when there's no way to move it to get it into those two slots

780
04:20:36,389 --> 04:21:08,489
at the top? How do I get it up? I don't get how I get it up there. Oh I see. I see one. I see. How

781
04:21:08,489 --> 04:22:25,590
do I get it up there? Yay. I can't let go of this. Um where do I go from here? What happened? What

782
04:22:25,590 --> 04:23:20,409
the hell happened? Oh the okay that was weird because look it was it was blocking me on. Wait

783
04:23:20,409 --> 04:23:27,659
that was really weird. Okay I thought I couldn't go up here. I had a lot of collision on that. I

784
04:23:27,659 --> 04:23:32,649
didn't I actually didn't think I could cross over it. No no like I'm serious. I got stuck. I thought

785
04:23:32,649 --> 04:23:38,569
this was like I thought the I thought this was blocking the path because I got stuck on it.

786
04:23:38,569 --> 04:23:46,920
You saw I got stuck. Like yeah see I was like oh shit I can't go up here. There's collision on

787
04:23:46,920 --> 04:24:40,549
some of that stuff. Weird. What happened? Nothing's still alive. Oh I got like ripped. Jesus.

788
04:24:44,940 --> 04:24:51,700
I won't do that ever again I promise. I'm done with that. You're not going to hear that for the

789
04:24:51,700 --> 04:25:37,430
rest of the day. I've almost completely turned into whatever I'm turning into. Am I controlling

790
04:25:37,430 --> 04:27:03,370
it? No. Where even are we? I got out of my system. I'm gonna clear these because I don't want to do

791
04:27:03,370 --> 04:27:55,819
them again. What's going on over here? This area is cool. Very interesting stuff. Very interested.

792
04:27:55,819 --> 04:28:58,229
So up I guess. What is in here? All right that wasn't easy. All right I'm done. I get it now. I

793
04:28:58,229 --> 04:29:07,940
know what you mean. What is in here? Go in and fucking find out. Why you oh what is in here?

794
04:29:09,219 --> 04:29:12,659
Go in and find out. Like why would I ask that like rhetorically out loud?

795
04:29:13,530 --> 04:29:22,389
That is that is E3 demo talk. I get you. I understand now. Wrapping around this corner

796
04:29:22,389 --> 04:30:12,459
right? I know what you mean. It fills air. Interesting. Okay so this is all right so an alien

797
04:30:12,459 --> 04:30:21,620
species landed on earth and started to like assimilate people. I mean this is like oh look

798
04:30:21,620 --> 04:30:49,420
we're this right this looks kind of like old god type of stuff. Jesus. I guess they've grown

799
04:30:49,420 --> 04:31:15,690
under their heads. Alien tech yeah. What's the point of doing that? Oh yeah um just like open up

800
04:31:15,690 --> 04:31:20,329
their rib cage and like peel their skin back and just peel it and just staple it. But what why?

801
04:31:20,329 --> 04:31:40,780
But what? What's this for? It's just unnecessary. Well that's weird. I can go down. I can go this

802
04:31:40,780 --> 04:31:56,139
way too. Looks like there's a lot of places to go. Um let me go up first here. But this is

803
04:31:56,139 --> 04:32:39,719
different. What's this? Babies? Okay we're gonna go this way. No we're not. We're gonna go the other

804
04:32:39,719 --> 04:33:45,900
way. I'm talking. It's a gel. Okay is it I don't know like I don't get it. You just stole Austin

805
04:33:45,900 --> 04:34:05,099
Powers mojo. So what do I do with that? I guess I'm gonna wait is there another place to go? No.

806
04:34:12,950 --> 04:34:19,880
Do you want to play the Austin Powers theme song? Would that be good? Would that be fun?

807
04:34:21,990 --> 04:34:38,790
I can't take this back. I don't want to play the Austin Powers theme song because I feel like it

808
04:34:38,790 --> 04:34:49,909
would ruin the rest of the game and we're getting to like the big climax. Look at those faces in

809
04:34:49,909 --> 04:35:17,450
here. Oh I should have done that. I shouldn't have done that. I should not have done that.

810
04:35:17,450 --> 04:35:35,619
I don't I shouldn't have done that. Did he get up? I don't think he gets up. Not yet at least.

811
04:35:35,619 --> 04:35:56,790
Plenty of health. Nice. All right good. Very good very good very good.

812
04:35:56,790 --> 04:36:19,799
Ammo. Fill it up. Looks good. I'm gonna load the guns all up. That one's all good. This one is all

813
04:36:19,799 --> 04:36:52,599
good. All right um so I imagine I take this one too. Will they fight each other? Excuse me. I don't

814
04:36:52,599 --> 04:37:18,680
get it but whatever. I take this fucking thing. Do you fit in here? No. I don't know where to take

815
04:37:18,680 --> 04:40:21,540
this. I can't weigh this down. What do I do with this body? I don't want to keep holding this. This

816
04:40:21,540 --> 04:40:37,139
is fucking weird. This is gross. I don't want to keep holding this. Um where do I put it? If I run

817
04:40:37,139 --> 04:41:18,790
this way what do I do with this? Jesus. Okay it's a full thing of uh of juice. Wait. Uh oh. So I put

818
04:41:18,790 --> 04:41:25,750
this back on here and I filled this. So this person's- I'm gonna ruin this whole thing if I do

819
04:41:25,750 --> 04:42:12,569
this. I'll do it for one second. No I'm not gonna. Fine. Fuck it. What if I care really?

820
04:42:12,569 --> 04:42:29,110
It didn't do anything. We need two of them. You need two. So I gotta get the other one or whatever

821
04:42:29,110 --> 04:42:38,090
okay. This one's gonna get up and I have to fight it. Can I go back this way? It's blocked off right?

822
04:42:38,090 --> 04:43:11,619
Mm-hmm. Yep. I'm in. This time it's gonna get up and fight. Yeah there's no doubt in my mind. Time

823
04:43:11,619 --> 04:43:48,970
to fight it. Why am I- why am I- I'm like a tree. All right I gotta shoot the sides right? Are those

824
04:43:48,970 --> 04:45:32,950
explosive? Oh my god they are. Oh my god. I think I'm dead in one hit. Move. See ya. What? Oh come

825
04:45:32,950 --> 04:46:12,459
on. So you gotta wait till he runs out of gas. You've run out of gas already. Run out of fucking gas!

826
04:46:13,659 --> 04:46:47,159
Oh you just triple- what would he get the lock and load? I just got triple tapped

827
04:46:47,159 --> 04:46:55,830
direct by two free grenades in a fucking row. Are you kidding me? He led me and lock and loaded me.

828
04:46:55,830 --> 04:47:36,229
What do I do? What? Oh shoot him in the- I don't know what's going on. What do I get that? I don't

829
04:47:36,229 --> 04:48:06,659
get it. Did I screw up? I want to shake your hand. Dude just fucking get out of here. Should I shoot

830
04:48:06,659 --> 04:48:17,479
him in the legs or something? Okay this guy. If you kill me right now I am going to eat this keyboard.

831
04:48:17,479 --> 04:48:32,759
Do you understand? All right open up! Open! What's going- dude how do I- the back is back is back. Oh

832
04:48:32,759 --> 04:49:18,229
my god damn it dude. Come on. It takes some- freak it! Just move your fucking hand.

833
04:49:19,270 --> 04:50:03,909
What? Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Oh shit another gun. Jesus.

834
04:50:04,549 --> 04:51:04,819
Give me a fucking- that's not enough. That's not enough. I need another one. Is there another one

835
04:51:04,819 --> 04:51:37,509
even back here? Oh this one. How do I get over there? Good luck. Oh look at my health. That's bad.

836
04:52:06,220 --> 04:53:02,729
There's a claw. How do I get that to move? I don't know. I actually don't know. Kapow. Kapow. Kapow.

837
04:53:02,729 --> 04:54:06,250
Shoot it? That didn't work. What? Did I shoot this? Holy shit. Okay. Do I have to fight this again?

838
04:54:06,250 --> 04:54:15,880
I hope not. Do not. Dude no. I have to fight another one of these. I have to fight it again.

839
04:54:17,319 --> 04:54:22,970
You've got to be fucking kidding me. I don't want to fight this thing again. I have no health. I'm

840
04:54:22,970 --> 04:54:39,450
gonna lose. Dude this sucks. I don't want to fight this thing. Shit can I- what if I explode it?

841
04:54:40,090 --> 04:54:58,680
When it goes down for gas I'm gonna shoot this. Going down for gas. Oh my god I just did it.

842
04:54:58,680 --> 04:55:21,930
What did I just do? Are you dead? What did I- did I just do it? Cool. All right. All right I got it.

843
04:55:21,930 --> 04:55:48,729
What is even going on? I have way more questions than the beginning of the game.

844
04:55:51,590 --> 04:56:40,520
What's happening here? Um I can't use any other weapon. I can't take this off. All right well

845
04:56:40,520 --> 04:56:51,819
we got both of them filled up here. Wait is it saying I can't pick this up because my hands

846
04:56:51,819 --> 04:57:33,290
are covered in weird tree shit? Are you serious? I can't do this. Um how do I get this off? Okay.

847
04:57:33,290 --> 04:58:04,709
What's this? That scream. It's like a Tom and Jerry sound. Excuse me where's the health?

848
04:58:06,330 --> 04:59:50,919
Score. Reload. I think you're actually soft-locked. What? No I'm not. I bet you I jump in that suit

849
04:59:50,919 --> 05:00:07,700
and I get healed. Yeah I just gotta get the thing, run to that suit, and jump right in it.

850
05:00:07,700 --> 05:01:16,599
All right I can't do this. So I have to go over here and then down. What's this? Okay.

851
05:01:29,669 --> 05:01:41,779
Wait should I just get in this now? I can't. All right so what about over here? This looks like a

852
05:01:41,860 --> 05:02:05,479
track or an elevator. I have this key. Oh come on. No. Oh yes. I was gonna say can I not interact

853
05:02:05,479 --> 05:02:38,840
with it? Right I can't do this. Okay so now rip it off. Get in the suit. What else is over here?

854
05:02:38,840 --> 05:03:17,939
This is a five bubble door. I don't have a five bubble key. Am I seeing this right? What's going

855
05:03:17,939 --> 05:03:41,270
on? What is happening? Don't look. Score. I'm not pressing it again. All right so let's get this

856
05:03:41,270 --> 05:04:24,150
thing ripped off. Okay and let's go. That's just it. That's just ammo. That's ammo for the gun.

857
05:04:24,150 --> 05:04:46,599
All right um what's going on? Did you just come back? Shit um okay. Really? Okay I'm gonna get

858
05:04:46,599 --> 05:05:10,220
the thing ripped off. I'm gonna open this door. Okay what does that do for me? What is happening?

859
05:05:10,220 --> 05:05:53,880
Ah should I shoot this? Oh fuck. Okay hold on. What? Why am I? Dude are you all right?

860
05:05:53,880 --> 05:06:23,669
Uh dude are you cool? What's he doing? Hello? Score. I got scorned. It was poisonous. What do

861
05:06:23,669 --> 05:06:35,349
I do here? Should I just reset the game? All right I'm gonna quit. Now go to main menu right? Back to

862
05:06:35,349 --> 05:07:26,229
main menu and then continue the game. But don't do that again. Okay so now this is I have to go get

863
05:07:26,229 --> 05:07:33,930
bit by that thing again. Pick up the ammo. Let me heal. How much health do I have? Let's heal.

864
05:07:33,930 --> 05:08:09,419
All right so get bit. Pick up the thing. Grab the key. Pick it up. All right good. Nice.

865
05:08:13,189 --> 05:08:27,110
So now I have the key to get out of here. I've got full stack of the bombs. I'm okay.

866
05:08:28,500 --> 05:08:46,040
All right where's the door? Isn't it over here? Okay it's right here. So I get bit. Wait no I have

867
05:08:46,040 --> 05:08:59,209
to get bit and then come do this. Whatever this is. Right so let's get bit. Come do this. No just do

868
05:08:59,209 --> 05:09:09,459
the door. All right what's the fastest place to get bit? Right here and then run across. Let's go.

869
05:09:13,909 --> 05:09:29,290
I need the mojo. Where's the mojo? Where is it? Where is the mojo? Is it on my? Let me just open

870
05:09:29,290 --> 05:09:47,240
this door. It'll stay open. Okay where's the mojo? How am I gonna get back there? Okay how am I gonna

871
05:09:47,240 --> 05:09:58,180
get bit and run back and do this? Am I gonna have enough time? Run run run. Maybe I might just have

872
05:09:58,180 --> 05:10:27,830
just barely enough time. Okay I'm gonna try it. Okay here we go. Thanks for lying. Thanks for the

873
05:10:27,909 --> 05:10:32,150
whole experience bubble of Warcraft experience taken from me and health. I appreciate it.

874
05:10:32,150 --> 05:11:05,509
Just going straight. Damn okay. Oh it's just like the this is like the extraction machine I think.

875
05:11:05,509 --> 05:11:30,279
Do I actually have to? Can I even make it from here? I feel like I'm not gonna make it.

876
05:11:30,279 --> 05:11:39,130
Isn't there it was a close there's a closer one. No I'm not gonna make it.

877
05:11:39,130 --> 05:12:39,610
This is longer. I'm just gonna try it. Whatever I'm just gonna try it. Go go go go go.

878
05:12:39,610 --> 05:13:48,220
Huh wait I have to perform surgery on myself? Oh my goodness. Dude what? I got my mojo back baby.

879
05:13:48,619 --> 05:14:27,750
Oh shit they're all coming for me. I got my mojo back. All right I'll get me out of here.

880
05:14:27,750 --> 05:17:05,130
All right wait you blocked it back. You blocked it off. That gives me a headache.

881
05:17:05,130 --> 05:17:50,840
Look down. I know I see. I'm holding my intestines. Bro give me a break man. Are you kidding me?

882
05:17:58,009 --> 05:18:26,889
Geez. Holy Jesus man. Fucking relax. What the fuck? That's huge. That's all right. What's going on?

883
05:18:31,240 --> 05:18:54,040
I still have no idea what's happening. Oh all right I'm going back. I'm going down.

884
05:18:54,040 --> 05:19:48,330
I can plug the other thing in right? Let's go. Oh wrong way. All right here we go.

885
05:19:48,330 --> 05:21:15,959
What happens now? We're going up. I can hear somebody moving. What the fuck? What the fuck was

886
05:21:15,959 --> 05:22:55,209
that man? Uh what? Switch? What do you mean switch? Wait how do I switch? Oh wait what are they doing?

887
05:23:10,020 --> 05:23:17,450
How do I switch? How do I switch? What button is that? Switch what? How do I switch this?

888
05:24:09,340 --> 05:24:24,599
You wanted to go first? I don't have one of those. Do you? I don't have one of those either.

889
05:24:24,599 --> 05:24:34,779
Shit. Well the grand alien plan is ruined. We can't move. We can't go anywhere. Why

890
05:24:34,779 --> 05:25:28,680
won't this open? What's the problem? All right you stay here. I'm gonna go investigate.

891
05:25:28,680 --> 05:26:05,909
No? No am I crazy? I look like I made it a plastic. Oh here it is. Are we aliens or are we

892
05:26:05,909 --> 05:27:47,799
what are we? Are we aliens? Uh watch out behind you. These should both have it right? Sorry.

893
05:27:47,799 --> 05:28:26,970
There can only be one. Am I missing something? The way this camera angle looks like a piano is

894
05:28:26,970 --> 05:28:57,500
gonna fall on this guy. Any second now. Um can I move this or something? I'm missing. Eyes, fire,

895
05:28:57,500 --> 05:29:37,259
go right to the goal. Eyes, fire, hoof to the goal. Should I just? Should I go? I'm biting my lip like

896
05:29:37,259 --> 05:29:48,389
crazy. Should I just go this way and like explore over here? Can I even walk over here? Can I like

897
05:29:48,389 --> 05:30:10,599
stop this from happening? Wait what am I doing? All right they both need one of these. All right

898
05:30:10,599 --> 05:31:22,500
they both need one of. I don't put his hand on it. Do I just put can I place the body down here?

899
05:31:22,500 --> 05:32:35,669
I feel like that's what I have to do. Do we weigh more? Oh shit what's happening? I can't move.

900
05:32:35,669 --> 05:33:33,939
I can't turn. All I can do is walk straight. Wait what? This this for this thing again? What?

901
05:33:42,310 --> 05:33:51,819
Hey thanks for fucking standing there the whole time. Thanks for standing there. Really?

902
05:33:52,299 --> 05:34:25,340
Did I not wait did I not make it? Is that what we're implying here that I didn't make it to the end?

903
05:34:37,909 --> 05:35:56,630
Wait what? We're 10 feet away from whatever we were doing? That's it? Score. I was really hoping it

904
05:35:56,630 --> 05:36:10,259
was gonna say then it was gonna be on screen. Okay um that was weird so it's oh you're trying to

905
05:36:10,259 --> 05:36:20,119
continue whatever civilization or something but they were these mutated monsters that are stopping

906
05:36:20,119 --> 05:36:25,990
us and I get right to the end and I almost get through whatever the birth canal or something and

907
05:36:25,990 --> 05:36:31,880
then the thing stops me and eats me and consumes me we didn't end up actually doing it. I got there

908
05:36:31,880 --> 05:37:00,180
but I didn't make it. I'll just I'll just watch a baddie video about press continue. Okay can I

909
05:37:00,740 --> 05:37:11,619
I'm curious hold on a second can I walk through with this one or do you have to walk through

910
05:37:11,619 --> 05:37:26,180
with this one? No okay that's the only way all right. Why do I keep stabbing him? What's with

911
05:37:26,180 --> 05:37:41,459
the keep stabbing stab stab? I don't get it why do I have to keep stabbing this? I think this is

912
05:37:41,459 --> 05:37:55,959
bugged up. There's no definitive answer for anything. I mean that was crazy that was okay

913
05:37:55,959 --> 05:38:09,380
that last 20 minutes was that was insane. I'll watch a couple videos on it. That was that was

914
05:38:09,380 --> 05:38:18,659
good that was cool. I like that. I very much enjoyed that. And then that's a perfect time to

915
05:38:18,659 --> 05:38:26,419
end the stream too. All right so listen to me this is important. We've got a lot going on this weekend

916
05:38:26,419 --> 05:38:35,259
on Thursday. Thursday I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights sponsored. Are you ready for this?

917
05:38:35,259 --> 05:38:39,180

918
05:38:39,180 --> 05:38:47,580
Gotham Knights sponsored three days in a row. But here's the thing. I'm not just going to play

919
05:38:48,139 --> 05:39:00,200
Gotham Knights. We're going to do another Omega gaming weekend. It's an it's an Omega sponsor

920
05:39:00,200 --> 05:39:09,020
it really is. It's like free. It's like let's go you know what I mean? Like sometimes you just

921
05:39:09,020 --> 05:39:17,909
say fuck it let's go. So the Gotham Knights portion of each one of those streams on Thursday,

922
05:39:17,909 --> 05:39:23,590
Friday and Saturday are only going to be for a couple hours. Then for the remaining three four

923
05:39:23,590 --> 05:39:29,020
five plus hours whatever we're going to do something else. So keep this in mind I am

924
05:39:29,020 --> 05:39:35,990
contractually obligated to stream three days in a row. Some of it's going to be Gotham Knights.

925
05:39:35,990 --> 05:39:42,950
So I have to be here. I am not going to say to you guys oh you know it's like I just streamed

926
05:39:42,950 --> 05:39:51,139
on Thursday. See you on Sunday. No I'm contractually obligated to be here. So we're going to play

927
05:39:51,139 --> 05:39:56,169
Gotham Knights for a few days in a row. But we're also going to do a bunch of other shit too.

928
05:39:56,169 --> 05:40:04,099
I want to play horror games this weekend. I want to play the puppet combo games the new ones that

929
05:40:04,099 --> 05:40:12,409
came out. I want to play Breath of the Wild this weekend. Yeah Gotham Knights looks like it could

930
05:40:12,409 --> 05:40:24,459
be really fun. I don't know very much about it. I know it's um it's a game set in uh Arkham. That's

931
05:40:24,459 --> 05:40:33,830
not not Arkham. I meant to say Gotham. It's a game set in no Gotham is the city. Arkham is not the

932
05:40:33,909 --> 05:40:41,750
city. Gotham is the city. I don't know why I thought it was Arkham. That's my bad. What a fake fan.

933
05:40:41,750 --> 05:40:47,509
No I just screwed up. I was trying to say that the city Gotham it takes place in Gotham not Arkham.

934
05:40:59,130 --> 05:41:08,520
Anyways we're going to play Gotham Knights for three days and a bunch of other shit. I'm actually

935
05:41:08,520 --> 05:41:15,740
pretty excited. So I'll see you on Thursday where we're not going to start with uh with Gotham

936
05:41:15,740 --> 05:41:24,020
Knights. Gotham Knights will appear for like a couple hours right in the middle of all these

937
05:41:24,020 --> 05:41:32,419
streams. It's going to be super variety. We are going to be changing games every two or three hours

938
05:41:32,419 --> 05:41:38,279
and I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt. You better look at your ass. I'm gonna like why am

939
05:41:38,279 --> 05:41:44,500

942
05:42:06,200 --> 05:42:15,380
We'll see. Scoring was cool. That was a lot of fun. I the first 10 minutes I was like oh shit this is

943
05:42:15,380 --> 05:42:19,610
a puzzle game. But there's enough interesting stuff happening and I think a lot of the weird

944
05:42:19,610 --> 05:42:25,580
horror elements were enough to really keep you going. I think it's good. I thought it was fun.

945
05:42:27,400 --> 05:42:39,560
It was it was definitely an experience. I'd say that. But yeah I'll see you guys on Thursday

946
05:42:39,560 --> 05:42:45,080
or uh well is it Omega gaming weekend or is it just Thursday, Friday, and then one day on Saturday?

947
05:42:45,080 --> 05:43:01,819
