00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:10,710
Hey, phone call is good. I just, I had to take care of something. Something I didn't know that

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,269
I had to take care of, but I did have to take care of it, so I took care of it.

3
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:23,609
Welcome to Dreamcast Day 2 of the Dreamcast Stream Central.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,289
Taking care of it. Give me one second, I gotta uh, I gotta tweet that. I'll see you guys in a

5
00:00:35,289 --> 00:01:39,989
moment. All right, good afternoon. Good evening. All those things. I remember this screen. I

6
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,890
don't know why we're getting this screen again, but it's a good place for us to test the audio,

7
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,599
because I know a lot of people said last last or day night that it was out of sync.

8
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,730
So let's go ahead and see if we can get it in sync. Are you ready?

9
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,939
Here we go. You should be hearing my voice and the sound at the same time.

10
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:14,409
And here we one two three four one two three four five one two three four five six seven eight

11
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:35,139
nine ten eleven twelve one. Voice is behind. Okay. So the voice is behind. Really? What if

12
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:41,460
I give you one of these? One two three four eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight.

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:03:00,889
There. Voice is still behind. The voice is too early now. No, no way. Hold on.

14
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:17,129
Do a little thing like this. One two three four one two three four five six seven eight nine

15
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:28,969
ten eleven twelve. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

16
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:36,009
The game is a bit behind. Well, I can fix that too. Check this out. I have a ton of magic

17
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:42,919
tricks here. You ready? How about this one? One two three four five. Welcome to the

18
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:58,620
troubleshooting stream. Five six eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three. Oh the first

19
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,060
game by the way is the worst one. I need to get it out of the way as fast as I can. I saw

20
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,819
it on the table and I said I don't want to play this. I don't know why did I buy this?

21
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,830
It's not the evolution game. It's the fucking worst game ever. It was just a Dreamcast

22
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:23,930
exclusive. That's the only reason why I bought it. Never mind. I take back everything I just

23
00:04:23,930 --> 00:05:02,680
said. Uh his mouth is even doing. You know I'm glad we got to see at least this part here.

24
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:18,040
This is Toy Commander. Who gave that little kid explosives? That's it's supposed to be a

25
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:31,860
it's him imagining things. Run around in his house. All right so I don't know.

26
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:50,860
No. Evil? The evil crew? Andy the time has come we toys are sick and tired of how you are.

27
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:59,100
How you use us then toss us aside. So prepare for the mutiny as I Huggy Bear claim the title

28
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:12,980
of Toy Commander. So this is Toy Story 5. This is the toys rise up and like strangle

29
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:27,850
old Andy. Well he's in his sleep or something. Yeah it's the trip to the nursing home to find

30
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,019
Andy. W6Y. I don't I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. It's three letters.

31
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:58,629
I don't care. Well that's boy that's Andy. A lot of uh don't give a shit about copyright

32
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,529
in some of these Dreamcast games. Not even copyright but like referencing

33
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:15,079
other like western media for some reason right? Copyright? No my point is is like

34
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:23,750
we had the whole family guy cast in the last game for some reason and now it's like Andy

35
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:52,490
toy game Andy. Okay so let's do 16 by 9. I'm not sure this is going to do anything. Is

36
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:00,699
this game older than Toy Story? No no way. Dude you don't have a game about toys. This

37
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:06,860
looks awful now. It just looks like I stretched it up or whatever. Who cares? Kitchen and dining

38
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:16,870
room. The rest of the house is coming soon. All we have is the dining room in our shelf.

39
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:29,259
Open the draw house. Okay kitchen and dining room. Training. Boiling rage. I am cyclone

40
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,899
and I am the boss of the kitchen. Each room in this house has its own boss. If you can

41
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,980
beat our records in at least four missions you'll be tested against us. If you defeat us

42
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,980
we'll become your allies. Then you can pilot us in the final duel against the Toy Commander.

43
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,559
Land the plane on the runway then use the helicopter to drop two sugar lumps into the

44
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:54,039
cup of hot cocoa. Finally use the pickup truck to find the chocolate bar. I'm liking the

45
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:01,980
Pee Wee Herman quests. Holy shit, Jerma, this game is my whole childhood. I never could

46
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,659
remember its name. Well it is Toy Commander. I'm glad you can see it and figure it out.

47
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:25,379
How do you fly? Okay right triggers fly. That's what I have to do. Grab the sugar.

48
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,820
Open world. This is the kitchen from Rat Movie.

49
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,580
It kind of is. All right grab the sugar. No land on the runway. Land on the runway. Okay.

50
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:30,629
Oh I didn't get it. Stop. How am I not on the runway? Land on the runway. This is the

51
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:43,370
runway right? Did I not land on the runway? Okay well let's go ahead and get the sugar.

52
00:10:44,090 --> 00:11:09,190
How do I open it? How does it want me to open the sugar thing? I'm gonna throw up

53
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:30,330
play this for more than two minutes I think. Oh wait what was that? Switch planes. All right

54
00:11:30,330 --> 00:12:03,529
land in the cup. How do I switch planes? How do I change vehicles? Okay how do I get out?

55
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:26,019
Okay it's apparently X. Come on you're not gonna tell me the controls of the game?

56
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:37,799
All right I gotta lift up this thing. What button is that? What button is like lift up sugar

57
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:57,990
thing? The sugar isn't there. What? Look at the mini map. That's not the sugar? The grid. I'm

58
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:21,259
no I'm supposed to put the sugar into the cocoa. There's no where's the sugar? Wait so

59
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:26,759
what the hell is the other? Look at the mini map. What's that for? What is that even for?

60
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:44,620
Look at the other mini map. Why is it on the sugar bowl? That's inverted fucking throw up

61
00:13:44,620 --> 00:14:22,070
controls by the way. Name of song. You really care about the song? Okay got it. It's a

62
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:34,470
chocolate candy. It's harder to fly this than I think it is to fly a helicopter in GTA 4

63
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:57,590
with the mouse and keyboard. I gotta change to the truck? I'm about to run out of time.

64
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:39,799
That how do I just change to the truck? Time is gas. Land on chocolate. Yeah I don't like I can't

65
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:58,679
change off the helicopter. Go pick up the pickup truck. This is supposed to be tutorial which

66
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:06,820
but in my mind is this is how you control the game. There is no explanation as to how

67
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,259
to change vehicles. It said go pick up the sugar and then pick up the cocoa and pick up the

68
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:28,620
cat poo. I don't have it. There's no I don't have a manual. Read the manual. I bought this used and

69
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,840
it came in a black fucking box. All right I pressed x last time and it didn't do that.

70
00:16:34,840 --> 00:17:07,930
Where the fuck am I supposed to go from here? I'm just on the table. Sorry I'm even distracted.

71
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:41,670
Does the cat do anything? Okay why why the truck is definitely more fun than the helicopter.

72
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,930
So do I have to pick up the truck? Because the only other indicator on the minimap is up there.

73
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:11,059
So do I pick up truck and put the entire game is this level? No it's not.

74
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:40,579
The food grinder? I would have loved this as a kid. So probably I would have too.

75
00:18:41,140 --> 00:19:13,430
Cat box? The yellow ramp against the wall. What? Where's the yellow ramp?

76
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,700
Am I actually blind? There's a yellow ramp against the wall.

77
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:29,859
No you guys this is you guys are horseshitting me here. Yellow ramp that goes up against the

78
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:38,099
wall. You guys are shitting at me right now. No way. Which wall is there a yellow ramp?

79
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:46,680
No that's not a ramp. That's a half pipe. Not even. What's this is not going to do anything.

80
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,759
Why does this work? How would you ever know this was going to work? There's no laws of

81
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,440
physics that's to explain why I'd be able to drive up the wall and stay on here.

82
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,180
There's no fucking way. Somebody in chat looked up the guide and figured it out.

83
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,500
Go up the little tiny half track and drive up the wall and drive on the ceiling.

84
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh my god I'm looking at chat. I did it. I went. Kids logic. No one would ever do that.

85
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:57,539
No kids are gonna do that. When you guys are saying ramp I thought you were talking about

86
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,819
an actual ramp that could take me driving on a regular plane with real physics.

87
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:14,779
Not go up the small yellow McDonald's symbol. Drive up the wall. I'm glad my kid wouldn't

88
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:20,859
fucking understand that because he would be he'd be he'd be logic about it. He'd be asking me

89
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,420
dad I don't see a ramp that an actual you know in real life that you'd bet I'd be like

90
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:39,640
me either. I'd pat him on the head. I didn't even read the instructions.

91
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,740
You've managed thus far but you're nothing unless you can cook. Drop the eggs into the water and

92
00:21:45,740 --> 00:22:03,430
don't forget to light the stove. Okay I'm ready. I need to pick up eggs. All right hold on.

93
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:09,750
Where are the eggs? Does it say where they are? Drop the eggs in the water. That's all we

94
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:20,549
get. I don't think that's an egg. That's a lighter though. I feel like I have to get the

95
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:28,950
other tank up there. That's fuel. All right eggs. Fridge. If I were a bunch of eggs I'd be in

96
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:51,609
the fridge. No there's eggs right here. All right so I need to switch because unless I go

97
00:22:51,609 --> 00:23:00,180
and land and push them into the water from this side this level is not going to take

98
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:17,829
12 minutes. Got it. Okay they got one. Time to beat is one minute and 30. Yeah but you're

99
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,109
not expected to do that first try. It takes a minute to figure out where the eggs even are.

100
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:51,420
Throw up controls. I need like a joystick. It's a toy commander if you're wondering.

101
00:23:52,730 --> 00:24:14,460
And it sucks. All right now it's gonna light the fuse. Stop stop stop stop.

102
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,180
Do I need to land on a special children's runway? Is that what this is?

103
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:37,859
All right do I have to find the one spot where I'm allowed to land? Guys.

104
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:51,210
Ah stop. Inverted stop please.

105
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,750
Can I change that shit? I forgot that game companies didn't realize how terrible it was

106
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:39,779
until like 2006. Plane altitude reverse. Is this is this it? No that's not it.

107
00:25:39,779 --> 00:26:01,109
No it is for the plane. What I'd want is I'd want inverted before the plane.

108
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:17,450
Toy commander. I thought I was gonna break this desk on spring.

109
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:26,650
I think I might. This is still it still wants me to put an egg in here.

110
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:37,210
How am I gonna do that? It's destroyed. I'm gonna have to just reset the game.

111
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,839
That's not gonna start a fire. I thought I was supposed to be using kid logic.

112
00:26:52,839 --> 00:27:14,519
Kids don't know how to use the stove. I do. Okay it's on. I'm burning the

113
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:29,700
fucking house down. So what was the point of giving me the tank in the first place?

114
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:40,119
I thought I had to change to it. Is that just a different way to go?

115
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:49,109
All right well here's this one. It's called rings of fire. Okay.

116
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,380
If you're a speed runner you go plane only. Okay this is a race.

117
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,420
Let's just fly through the ring.

118
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:15,480
Everything is bullshit. Everything is bullshit.

119
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Okay who's increasing my speed? What's with the frame rate?

120
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,099
Where are you even trying to tell me to go?

121
00:28:37,450 --> 00:29:04,470
What? God. This is horrible.

122
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:14,920
Superman 64. I have to beat this one. Wait I can kill the other competitors here?

123
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:41,660
Well immediately. What is it? What? I don't understand. Hold on. It's right next. It's the same ring?

124
00:29:44,859 --> 00:30:08,680
Now I'm of the opinion that video games were terrible.

125
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,119
But as children we were forced to play them because it's the only thing we had in the house

126
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:20,279
there. You couldn't just go and get a game on Steam. You couldn't go buy a game where

127
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,319
you're gonna go to GameStop. Mom you're gonna drive me to GameStop. No there was

128
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:30,420
no free to play Fortnite. There was no free to play TF2. If your mom got you a game at the grocery

129
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,440
store you had to play it and you played it all fucking day because it's all that you couldn't

130
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:58,390
go. It was all you had. I wonder how many games that I actually because like I'm sitting here

131
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,710
right now as an adult and going like man this is horrible. This sucks. Why would I ever play

132
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:09,539
this? If I got this as a kid I would have 100% at every single level and I would have been

133
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,980
like this game's awesome because that's all my mom got me. Like this is all like I can't get

134
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:34,470
anything else. They didn't have video games when you were a kid? Yes they did because they

135
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:41,579
also weren't jaded. Yeah and like there's been too many. Like GTA 5 exists. You know what I

136
00:31:41,579 --> 00:32:01,849
mean? With two spoiled as gamers. Okay take down the enemy bombers. But regardless of

137
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:05,930
what you think about GTA 5 these are like technically speaking this is just flying around

138
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:28,299
the living room shooting at radical v2 sets. The game that I played that was just painful

139
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:33,339
but it wasn't painful to me because I played it and I loved it. I'm trying to think which game

140
00:32:33,339 --> 00:33:07,779
it would be. I'm about to scream like mom go get me something else. I played Mario Golf at

141
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:33,799
Anthony's and I want it too. Mario Golf came out good. What a game that was. No one had

142
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:51,130
played golf before on a computer but they're all above. Are we on different teams?

143
00:33:52,250 --> 00:34:52,139
How do I keep missing this guy? All right that was quite demanding. This is your base.

144
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:04,260
I know but I can't. There. Okay I Mario golfed that guy. Hole in one. Just sit here.

145
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:40,250
I am using the radar. What does this have on IGN? It hurts. That was Toy Commander. I can't do the

146
00:35:40,250 --> 00:36:12,840
controls anymore. Let's move on to a good one. God I'm gonna nostalgia's gonna hit me in the

147
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:30,460
face here. This is not even gonna be fun. Let's do Power Stone. We've been so that was a nine

148
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:40,860
on IGN but it probably makes sense though. That was like so long ago. All jokes aside

149
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:53,019
this game is actually really really awesome. Highly recommend. This is Power Stone.

150
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:09,690
Rage quit this one. No! Did I rage quit Dynamite Cop? No I beat it three times. I thought it was

151
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,090
great. Then it was a fun game. One of my favorites. I'm not gonna rage quit. Power Stone!

152
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,610
Here it comes.

153
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:51,239
Here it comes. Falcon. Wang. Gun Rock. There's Power Stone 2 as well.

154
00:37:52,920 --> 00:38:04,739
Fuck it didn't do it the way that I said. Still good. So how the game works.

155
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:14,659
It's a fighting game. Uh kind of. It's a fighting game. The whole point is there are

156
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:22,969
Smash Balls. Wait I think they got that idea. So there are three Smash Balls that

157
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,769
will uh show up. What you gotta do is you gotta collect them and you get three Smash Balls.

158
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:32,170
Three Power Stones. Your character turns into the Power Stone version of their character.

159
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:40,309
So I wonder. Let's play Jack. All right I don't really remember the controls or anything

160
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,889
but it's very fun. Jack versus Jack.

161
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,889
One two. Got them both. Got them all. Here I am.

162
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:29,539
Essentially you have to avoid them. It's two stones. Don't let them get the other one.

163
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:30,179
Knock them out.

164
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,539
Oh yeah knocked it out of the hem. I'm gonna uh where's it this way. One more.

165
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,340
I am the green Jack.

166
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,269
Now take two of your stones.

167
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:07,429
You gotta just bully in the very beginning and get three stones as soon as possible.

168
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:13,659
We jumped over it.

169
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:22,300
No wowies. Okay that's all right. That's all right. That's okay.

170
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:26,539
Uh oh. Not okay. Where's the yellow one?

171
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:35,670
Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Over here.

172
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:55,860
Ah. Got him with the bump. This game is so much fun. Let's just go ahead and beat the

173
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:16,630
whole game first right. In Lundo. Lundo. He's like kind of the red Power Ranger.

174
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:34,820
Uh oh. That's not good. Can't take this much damage.

175
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:56,539
Got it. Gotta get a good hit. Got it. Got it. One more. Got it. One more. That's okay. We're good.

176
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,199
He's not paying attention to any of the gems. This is a mistake.

177
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,400
Uh oh. No, no, no, no, no. He's gonna get blue. I'm gonna get yellow.

178
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:17,670
Okay. Soft screen. Holy shit he just tailed me.

179
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,369
I know there's like a block or a dodge I think. From what I remember.

180
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,699
Reverse or I know there is.

181
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:57,219
Oops. Lost the other gem, didn't you?

182
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:13,130
Take it. Let's go. Damn it. Oh man. He's smart. I'm getting kind of beat here.

183
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,699
Oh that was bad. I need to go and like practice and learn to do those blocks and stuff.

184
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,579
Grab two.

185
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:57,530
Are you smarter than a dream cat? Maybe that's you. No, just get the stones. Just get the stones.

186
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,619
I'll take it.

187
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:33,750
No. See there it is. There's the dodge. How do you do that? There's that like dash. How do you do that? Trigger?

188
00:44:45,400 --> 00:45:16,329
What block is? I'm so like. Got it.

189
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:28,409
Holy shit if he kills me in power stone form it'll be so embarrassing.

190
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:40,949
Thank you. Freudian weapon for five community subs. Play with italics. I don't have another

191
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:55,480
controller. I don't have two dreamcast controllers unfortunately. Go back to toy commander.

192
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,639
Why would you want me to do that? Hold on. Is it okay? Button config. Here we go. All right.

193
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:13,739
Jump. Grab. Punch. So what's the dash? Power fusion one. Power fusion two.

194
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:21,019
Yeah you get a special move. Two of them. Maybe saw falcon do it. But then you lose your power

195
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:34,630
stone. So let's grab. Dash with that maybe. That's not good. Damn it she got it.

196
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:44,980
No what's that? Sorry I only get hit by one thing.

197
00:46:45,619 --> 00:47:03,460
Oh a direct hit right in her head. Let me try those one of the fusion.

198
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:17,139
Let's see what happens. Oh exactly that's awesome. So I get in close and do the cyclone.

199
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:45,750
Look at the jumping. Can blow. Didn't get her. See ya.

200
00:47:45,750 --> 00:48:03,900
I don't know how to do that with it.

201
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:13,510
This game is cool. This game is very cool.

202
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:23,820
Fine you want to play that game? Get you right at the wake up.

203
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:43,780
Thank you. Very cool. What's the other special move?

204
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:52,659
The jump above you. You do right trigger and that's the other special.

205
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:04,019
I also can't understand why Capcom has not made a new one of these. They only came up

206
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:17,719
for Dreamcast. They were only available for Dream. One and two that's it. It's such a cool

207
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:23,159
franchise that even it's a very simple combo concept. But they could turn it into something

208
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:28,519
so much bigger. But the popularity of games like Smash right now. You wouldn't want to

209
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,860
have like your own kind of version of this.

210
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:51,780
And then you're the other one.

211
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:55,780
That's not a good place to be. Especially right now.

212
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:05,349
Into the meat grinder. Oh he's a fan. I got it.

213
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:27,719
There's a lot of dynamic with who has one, who has two. It's really fun just to try to

214
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:33,989
dance around the fact that even when you have three, this could be a waste of time.

215
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:38,230
Somebody put, there was a lot of people who played this game that didn't even give a shit

216
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,469
about the gameplay. Just went for the, just went for the kill. That's it.

217
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:45,639
Because it was too much of a distraction. So oh what? Randomly spawned.

218
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh now let me, let me two stalk him. Come on. He's gonna get all three. He is. He turns

219
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,360
into the thing.

220
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:13,429
Fucked.

221
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,420
That kind of sucked. I'm not gonna lie.

222
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:33,610
And we keep going back. I'm not gonna get it.

223
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:45,659
Dominoes of Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut. I'm gonna, I'll tell you first try I'm gonna get to the end.

224
00:51:49,179 --> 00:52:03,659
Or lose. Did you say wrong? Pizza Hut has stuffed crust. I don't really like to order

225
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:09,820
either of them. I like local places. I like local places. But if I'm gonna order Pizza Hut

226
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:20,889
for Dominoes, I'm gonna get the stuffed crust. All right they're all three around. One, two, three. All the same

227
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:35,480
corner. Every Pizza Hut smells like a bowling alley. No it doesn't. All Pizza places smell like

228
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:51,420
a bowling alley. Every Pizza Hut is next to a bowling alley. I mean I'm not gonna argue with that.

229
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:17,769
Bowling alley is usually served with served pizzas. Yeah. What's the matter with bowling

230
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:22,969
alley? I don't like bowling in bulk. And I find it. I can, I can see.

231
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:30,010
You know what? Okay I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a how the hell is it possible

232
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:36,889
scenario. So bowling is like an old like boomer thing to do. That's what a lot of you

233
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:45,130
would say. Right? So how do bowling alleys survive and not arcade? Bowling alleys are

234
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:50,329
like kind of old and old school and a lot of arcades don't go away.

235
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:58,489
It's the same thing. A lot of arcades have closed down. They've kind of been

236
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:06,650
stuffed into the Gaven Buster style. But actual, you think of a bowling alley.

237
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:15,820
What the fuck is a corporate bowling alley? They don't exist. It's like Bob's bowling alley

238
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,460
or the Lanes. One guy owns it. It's not like a corporation. There's no big bowling company.

239
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:35,000
So the Gaven Buster's argument like doesn't work there. How did they get to stay in business? And

240
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:50,969
arcades didn't. Mom and pop arcades I mean. I guess that their overhead really is not that

241
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:57,159
much maybe. How much does it cost to run a bowling alley? I mean you'd probably have the

242
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:07,670
same balls and same pins for a long time. All right I gotta pay attention. I'm at the final

243
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:14,630
second of the whole line. All right I'm getting dumped on here. I'm getting dumped on. I'm not

244
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:37,300
gonna get perfect. All right. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.

245
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:54,940
Yep. Don't let the wake up happen. No no no no no no. Don't let the wake up happen.

246
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:04,019
She's getting both the stones. Greedy. He went for the stones.

247
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:15,719
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Direct hit. No. Get her with the bomb.

248
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:34,199
Do it. You didn't even see. Really. It's like a beta so hard by the computer.

249
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:58,059
Knock them both. Give me. Give me. Give me. Shit. God damn it. This is bad.

250
00:56:59,019 --> 00:58:06,789
Oh my sweaty hand. Uh-oh. That. No. No. Where'd it go? What just hit me? What? Hit me. All right.

251
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:16,699
We're at the final battle with the Captain Hook flapjack character.

252
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,469
I mean let me first try Power Stone after like 15 years of not playing it. Come on.

253
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:53,820
I'm ready. No. Environment.

254
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:23,460
He's just trying to get the gems. He's just a gem hoarder. Last one. Got it. Twice in a row.

255
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:46,579
Got it. Environment. Get him with the environment. One more time. Shit. He has a gun.

256
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:55,050
Oh. He got greedy and it was downfall.

257
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:18,860
All right. No. Shit. I got too greedy with it. I can still do it. I can. I'm in trouble. No.

258
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:51,219
Oh no. I'm gonna die here. He didn't even use his special. Good. Where'd he go? Oh, he's

259
01:00:51,219 --> 01:01:03,179
holding on. Okay. I see. All right. I gotta get it one more time.

260
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:41,269
Fuck. Did I win? Fuck. Shit. No. Oh, the timer. Oh, I had it. Come on. Let's go.

261
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:58,619
That was horrible placement. You see that bullshit? That was bullshit. That was

262
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:30,679
unfucking believable. I just got screwed. Really? That was so salty. That was such bullshit.

263
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,840
I knocked him into all three of them. That was such. I fucking actually mad about that.

264
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:48,699
I literally knocked all the gems out of him and he fell down into all three. That was

265
01:02:48,699 --> 01:03:01,500
stupid. I had it, too.

266
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,260
I was gonna do a first try. Oh, well.

267
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,369
Did he just catch me in the air?

268
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:42,420
He's doing his little cheat move where he just. All this guy cares about is the smash ball.

269
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,840
So I don't even care about the smash ball. Just beat him.

270
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:08,809
Baby. I should have had it that first try. Those of you Power Stone vets will know what

271
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:32,260
I'm talking about. He was. He wasn't focused on it.

272
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:53,639
See? Look. He cares so much about this. I should have just fought him like this the whole time.

273
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:19,619
Give me both. Move out of my way. You greedy asshole. Your character bottle's too big.

274
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:44,869
Oh, God. He's gonna do it again. No. Why? What the fuck? That's so stupid.

275
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:57,769
It was in his. Oh, I'm gonna die. He just. Just fucking. Oh, my God. I'm so angry.

276
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:10,409
The dude just drop kicks you once. He has a move. He has a move where if he. If he

277
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:14,329
touches you with it once, he just. It's like a beep and it knocks out your stuff.

278
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:17,210
This guy's too hard. I hate this again and again.

279
01:06:24,469 --> 01:06:38,539
Thankfully, this move sucks. God, I just got too mad. I'm so tilted from that first fucking

280
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:48,539
try. Fucking asshole pirate. His body. He's got like a fucking square of a hitbox that

281
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:59,159
he can just push into you. Are you ready? That's that move right there. It is a half second

282
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:02,119
frame.

283
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:44,070
Why? Why? What? It's cuz he's doing that move.

284
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:11,079
Oh, I can't see patchy from Spongebob. I beat everyone in the game on the first try and

285
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:37,130
you see like his cheap shit move that he has. Fucking believable.

286
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:10,630
No.

287
01:09:25,300 --> 01:10:30,119
Get over here. No, fuck off. Just die.

288
01:10:30,119 --> 01:11:13,220
No, fuck. Just use it.

289
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:44,579
Bomb. I win. I win. I win. Eat shit. Fuck that pirate guy. Hope your boat flips over

290
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:56,329
and flapjack. Oh, that's not even the last boss I forgot. Oh, right. It's this guy.

291
01:11:56,329 --> 01:12:21,140
All right, let's go. Oops. Oh, he does so much damage.

292
01:12:38,810 --> 01:13:03,510
Damn it, I didn't get him. Oh, damn it. Holy shit, he's insane. He does like two

293
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:31,399
and a half bars a hit. This is bad. I don't know what the hell he does.

294
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:31,510
Bad placement. That move. Oh my god. Give it here. Give it here. Give it here.

295
01:14:32,069 --> 01:15:28,779
Give me that. Oh, Fafn is my real name. What the hell was that? Like, like, what happened?

296
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:50,810
Oh shit.

297
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:10,100
Damn it. I had to. Oh, what was that bounce off the wall? That bounce off the wall. The

298
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:19,399
sucked into his body like a fucking vacuum. Give me the third one right now. Over here.

299
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:46,020
Give me a good spawn. Get the fuck out of here. Come on, one more.

300
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:47,529
That bomb.

301
01:17:48,409 --> 01:18:15,899
Just tap him. Just tap him.

302
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:29,739
Don't fucking throw it. I can't. I just got like, comboed. No way. Impossible.

303
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:39,380
I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I got six.

304
01:18:39,699 --> 01:18:40,180
What?

305
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,279
Fuck you. You want to get flawless, dickhead? Is that what you want to have happen?

306
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,899
You want to get flawlessed after that bullshit?

307
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:51,659
Fucking god, I can't believe it. I can't fucking believe it. I had one hit.

308
01:19:52,710 --> 01:20:00,789
My god, one more shit. That's such dog shit. Dude, literally took me six health. Oh, I am.

309
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:07,539
This is the maddest I've ever been in a video game in my entire life, I think. That's

310
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:15,739
un-fucking-believable. He did almost six full health bars in like two different, I'm so mad.

311
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:27,560
That's unbelievable. That is so fucking ridiculous.

312
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:32,520
Just kill me. Do two moves and kill me, final boss.

313
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,880
I got sloppy. I didn't get sloppy. I got unlucky.

314
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:45,560
Because I did my move and you have two or three seconds after your move is done.

315
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,159
For him to go do a bunch of fucking, set up a bunch of mouse traps for me.

316
01:20:50,279 --> 01:21:07,420
Want to get flawlessed. Yeah. But don't worry. He just had to do two moves to do four.

317
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:15,829
Oh, I hate that. Dude, I understand like you give a final boss and you make it stronger and shit,

318
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:20,550
but like does he have to be like three or four times stronger? You know what I mean? Why?

319
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:25,420
Does he have to do like four times your damage? What the hell is that?

320
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:44,579
Who's made up that? No, it's very doable. I'm just hyper tilted right now.

321
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,060
It's like you gotta, you gotta beat the last boss three times. He's got like,

322
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:59,770
why even have the health bar here? Why don't you give him like, like five more health bars?

323
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:12,170
All right, this is the one. This is the one. Let me, let me beat the boss three times in a row.

324
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,449
And then win.

325
01:22:39,609 --> 01:22:51,930
Oh my god. Why did I do that? Just kill me again.

326
01:22:52,170 --> 01:23:33,319
God damn it. Just kill me. I'll try one more.

327
01:23:48,779 --> 01:24:01,859
Fast. Okay. It's almost, look at the bars. Look at the top left bars.

328
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:05,220
He landed on his stomach and took 60% of my health pool.

329
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:14,250
Oh, I can't fucking believe it. You should, I should be embarrassed

330
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,850
because this motherfucker was dead almost twice in a row.

331
01:24:49,819 --> 01:25:11,770
He's gonna get it because they spawned right in front of him. That's unbelievable.

332
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:43,319
Why didn't you, why didn't you, uh, I gotta go back to the character I played before.

333
01:26:49,779 --> 01:27:02,149
Try. Let's do the roll.

334
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:07,989
No, that's pretty good.

335
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:18,760
Okay.

336
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:43,619
No, I have to beat this. This game is really good. I'm just salty at the last unfair boss.

337
01:27:44,979 --> 01:28:10,979
This is like the Shao Kahn. Let me phrase it. This is, this is Mortal Kombat 1 Shao Kahn.

338
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:29,239
How did you, you're gonna jump up? Give me a fucking break. You're gonna jump over a goddamn fire?

339
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:44,199
What, what's the priority? Why did you get priority there? Oh my god. We both did this.

340
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,229
Still doable.

341
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:23,930
Christ.

342
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:52,489
He's gonna get it now. Fucking god, Jeremy, get out of here!

343
01:30:04,579 --> 01:30:16,329
What the fuck was that?

344
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:34,600
Shit.

345
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:50,100
Yeah, another thing that somebody just said is true. Forget about like the awful gen squad.

346
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,460
It's like dodging and blocking something that I don't even know how to do it.

347
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:59,939
I don't, can I, is it even, I don't remember it being the game.

348
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:07,960
What's like the dodge? How do you do it? Is it possible in a certain fucking combination?

349
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:19,510
Because then, that's, sometimes you can reverse him.

350
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:28,470
I don't think it exists.

351
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:45,210
You have to jump or press a direction at perfect timing. Okay.

352
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,260
Am I getting baited here?

353
01:31:57,539 --> 01:31:59,050
I think I'm getting baited.

354
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:06,069
Yeah, I just got baited.

355
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:16,979
I'm not timing it right.

356
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:34,380
I'm pretty sure I'm just getting fucked here. When you get hit.

357
01:32:34,859 --> 01:33:28,659
No, I'm not gonna rage at Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk doesn't have a boss that has times 10 health and times 10 damage. It's a skateboarding move. It's faster.

358
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:55,000
It's so fucking sad to me because like I had it, I had it so close and then I just got

359
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:16,779
just bodied over and over again. I would have moved on to Tony Hawk by now. He's doing it. He's just so perfect.

360
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:29,130
When you talk about like difficulty spikes, right? The entire game was breezed until the last two bosses.

361
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:33,770
Like what the fuck? When did this game come out? 2025?

362
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:44,699
Oh okay, I'm gonna like just hunker down the traffic. I'm just progressively getting worse

363
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:57,989
because I'm just exhausted trying to beat this fucking guy. All right, here we go.

364
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:32,970
Dude, he's like gluing to these items. No, why did I do that? Just shut up, Jeremy. Just beat him.

365
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:05,050
What? What? What? What? When did I lose the other one? What the fuck, man? What?

366
01:38:07,659 --> 01:38:20,579
You gotta be kidding me. You have to be kidding me. There's no way. That was...

367
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,449
I don't care who you are, everybody knows I'm stupid.

368
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:33,109
Was. Just was. All right, I'm not going in the air ever again. I'm literally never

369
01:38:33,109 --> 01:38:43,479
gonna jump in the air. Not one time. Never. I'm gonna do this to myself.

370
01:38:43,479 --> 01:39:46,819
Oh, you don't.

371
01:39:46,819 --> 01:40:46,359
Come on. God. He dodged.

372
01:41:19,859 --> 01:41:42,920
Got some fucking RNG there, didn't I? God damn it.

373
01:41:47,510 --> 01:42:22,140
No. God damn it. It's okay.

374
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:35,380
Somebody did mention he is like perfect dodging almost every one of my attacks.

375
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:46,279
Fuck me, man. It is so close. I mean, it's one thing to learn how to like properly

376
01:42:46,279 --> 01:43:04,250
dodge every attack, but he's dodging almost every one. He's getting so many of these

377
01:43:04,329 --> 01:43:09,130
rolls to the way they just appear behind him right next to him on top of him. It's like, come on.

378
01:43:12,939 --> 01:43:18,390
And it takes so much to kill him. I might as well just restart. Try to get him.

379
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:33,899
I gotta dodge that at least. I keep getting caught every time.

380
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:54,489
He can get like, I have not even one bar.

381
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:28,979
I don't like this guy super.

382
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:49,689
Oh my. Just trying to get away from him and he's just...

383
01:44:53,689 --> 01:44:57,210
He also has perfect sight of the gems when you're limited to what the game shows you.

384
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:03,420
Okay, I'm gonna try a different character. Maybe it's like time to roll on like this guy.

385
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:10,619
I don't even know. I'm here. I have to be here.

386
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:19,449
Are you ready?

387
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:28,229
Flamethrower is honestly the best thing to ever use. It's going to him.

388
01:46:28,869 --> 01:46:31,350
Just only run around until you get a flamethrower.

389
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:48,149
Exhibit A. There it is. I will cheese the fuck out of this guy. Do you think I care?

390
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:53,369
Let's go.

391
01:47:13,779 --> 01:47:15,899
No, he got the gun before I did!

392
01:47:20,779 --> 01:47:21,979
He's too focused on it.

393
01:47:21,979 --> 01:47:44,520
What? Oh my god. Fuck off.

394
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,579
I don't know if I have enough health to do it. I think it's gonna be perfect.

395
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:28,149
You gotta be fucking kidding me. It like bounced and he was gonna get it regardless.

396
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:31,189
Oh my god. It's such bullshit. It really is.

397
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:10,300
What happened? What the fuck was that?

398
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:31,739
Fucking kidding me, man. That's... This is so stupid. That actually is dumb. That's really dumb.

399
01:49:31,739 --> 01:50:28,680
Just live. Live. Three. Two. One. Don't do it. That's it. What?

400
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:28,840
I love how I got the power stone. He did more damage than I did.

401
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:35,819
Fuck you.

402
01:51:48,069 --> 01:51:51,750
But like I can't move during that. He gets a free hit every fucking time.

403
01:52:18,279 --> 01:52:23,369
Oh my god.

404
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,340
Come on. Come on.

405
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:22,420
See what I'm talking about? He gets a free fucking hit.

406
01:53:41,479 --> 01:53:44,279
I freaked out. It's okay.

407
01:53:45,079 --> 01:53:48,359
Don't spawn over there.

408
01:54:03,939 --> 01:54:08,899
Fucking stupid idiot. Why would you even pick up an item for no reason? He's so much faster than

409
01:54:08,899 --> 01:54:15,539
you. There's no reason to do what I just did. Like unbelievable. I thought it was like a gun

410
01:54:15,539 --> 01:54:19,939
or something. He is so unbearably difficult. Like why wouldn't you just...

411
01:54:46,340 --> 01:55:04,710
Fucking god, I hate this.

412
01:55:07,899 --> 01:55:22,199
I can't fucking believe it, man. I just... I still got it. My hands are like literally sweating.

413
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:33,739
Where's the other one?

414
01:56:04,539 --> 01:56:07,260
I did it. I had to have won. I had to have won.

415
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,319
I did it. I win. I win the game. I'm done.

416
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:50,539
I don't know what. What? What the fuck was that? I couldn't even do anything.

417
01:56:53,539 --> 01:57:11,829
What? Give me the stone.

418
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:55,460
It's very... Okay, it's very possible. Oh my god. Give it to me. Do I get to do this again?

419
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:02,340
I have... This is not even as bad. This is like the jokey end of the game. I mean it's

420
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:10,899
horrible. Yeah, thank god. All right, let's go. Let me beat Akira. There's no dodging that.

421
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:19,159
He just has to take a whole painful hit. I'm trying to dodge these.

422
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,250
I don't even sure if I can.

423
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:43,500
Dodge roll? I don't know if it's possible because it's not technically an attack.

424
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,060
It's kind of just a big thing with attacks.

425
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:57,659
Try jumping over them? You lose speed when you jump.

426
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:16,539
One second.

427
01:59:16,539 --> 01:59:38,090
Don't go behind him. Well, he wasn't... There was only behind him.

428
01:59:49,619 --> 02:00:03,930
Watch out. Shit. I'm behind him. I'm behind him. I'm looking for like...

429
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:06,489
Oh my god. That's un-dodgeable. Just never be...

430
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:22,550
Actually, he doesn't no matter what. I think it's just random number generator.

431
02:00:23,350 --> 02:01:29,590
Oh, god damn it. How much health do I have? No, god. Timer. Oh, man.

432
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:38,550
I just spent... That's what I thought. It was a bad idea.

433
02:01:41,449 --> 02:01:47,560
I'll get it. I mean, this is... I hate everything about this, but I'm going to beat it.

434
02:01:49,819 --> 02:02:06,569
I have like another move that's like a... I think I'm actually really just going to use it

435
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:18,729
like this and then run if I collect the stones. I'm not even sure if I pick up the stones.

436
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:25,939
It's a waste of time because you just set yourself up for getting your ass kicked.

437
02:02:26,899 --> 02:02:32,899
It's just so vulnerable. I pick up items. He's doing more damage than I just did.

438
02:02:34,739 --> 02:03:06,390
He's done with his dip. Show. I'll take it. Sword. End it with sword.

439
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:12,640
Game over.

440
02:03:15,579 --> 02:03:27,750
Oh, that was hell. For the Chaos Emerald.

441
02:03:28,229 --> 02:03:33,640
He doesn't need it. He shatters it.

442
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:42,810
Worst ending.

443
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:55,989
Yeah, that was like the world's going.

444
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:05,689
Was the ending worth it? I had to do it because internally,

445
02:04:05,689 --> 02:04:24,869
if I stopped at that last boss, I would have been so unfulfilled. My reputation would have been

446
02:04:24,869 --> 02:04:40,329
ruined. Mrs. Space, thanks for 10 community subs. Thank you so much, Mrs. Space. 10 community

447
02:04:40,329 --> 02:04:57,159
subs. Okay, there's the Infinity Gauntlet. Game over. The end? Please wait. A new feature

448
02:04:57,159 --> 02:05:04,229
has been added. Would you like to save now? Yes, sure. Do all endings? I don't think I

449
02:05:04,229 --> 02:05:18,039
can handle it. What's the new feature? Extra options. Game options. Oh, wow. Now I can

450
02:05:18,039 --> 02:05:27,850
set how many power stones you have to get. Extra items. Damage recovery. I can fuck around

451
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:37,609
with these. Game options. We are like bright. There's no way I'm going to make anything

452
02:05:37,609 --> 02:05:58,789
harder than this. Beat the game on easy. No. What else is there? Anything else?

453
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:11,930
I just want to see something. So how do you unlock it? Do I not unlock it? How do I unlock

454
02:06:11,930 --> 02:06:17,399
the other characters? Next? Now hold on. Wait, hold on. I know. I'm not going to do the

455
02:06:17,399 --> 02:06:28,949
whole thing. I have to beat the game with every character to unlock it. You have to

456
02:06:28,949 --> 02:06:33,510
beat the game without using continues. That's not even a joke. Holy shit.

457
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:42,779
No. You have to look under the...

458
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:50,390
This game is really, really fun, though. Especially when you play it with more than

459
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:55,300
one person. Which one are you? I'm the one that's currently getting...

460
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:11,350
Yeah. I mean, it's just that last block. It's just like, come on. What the hell

461
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:20,149
was that nonsense? Times three damage, times five dodge, times five health. Like,

462
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:30,500
it's just, it's just accurate. I have a skin. Default skin.

463
02:07:33,859 --> 02:07:44,970
But it is very good. Forget about my final boss complaints. This is Final Smash.

464
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:51,930
The video game, essentially. It's very, very good. Did I say the game sucks at

465
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:55,449
all? I don't think it did. When I was, like, in the middle of that meltdown where I was

466
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:58,970
getting destroyed by the black ball. I didn't say the game sucked, did I?

467
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:18,779
Well, that move is amazing. Did it beat the boss? I did. I beat the two bosses. I did.

468
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:24,300
Okay, good. Good. Because I don't believe that. Whatever my frustrated mind would say,

469
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,659
I don't believe that. It was actually very good.

470
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:48,180
But I beat Valgus, but Fluggin Brothers is too hard. All right, we got, I played,

471
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:50,819
this is kind of what I figured was gonna happen. I was gonna play something like

472
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:56,789
Power Stone for a couple of hours. It's so fun. Fuck that final boss.

473
02:09:02,699 --> 02:09:09,909
So we're gonna move on from here. I have Tony Hawk.

474
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:23,050
I also have a survival horror game called Carrier. Because if I put in Tony Hawk,

475
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:33,960
I'm gonna play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night. So we gotta get

476
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:38,819
some of these other ones out of the way. So just give me one sec.

477
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:49,539
Okay, I just opened the case and the glass shattered. Like three chunks of glass just,

478
02:09:49,539 --> 02:09:55,260
like, shot up over here. I didn't, I just opened it. I just opened the glass.

479
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:02,310
I opened the case. I gotta be careful. I gotta pick this shit up. Hold on.

480
02:10:02,949 --> 02:10:09,100
Because that will be bad. It's like sharp. It's not glass. It's that like super sharp

481
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:18,760
plastic bullshit. Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure is on PC. So I'm gonna do those

482
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:24,899
at a different day. The games I'm doing today are the games that are not available

483
02:10:24,899 --> 02:10:30,979
anywhere else. Only on Dreamcast. The actual console. Can't, they weren't ported, etc.

484
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:42,100
I have all of them. Shenmue is another one. Shenmue, I had an option to get it on

485
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:52,260
Dreamcast, but not even last year. They ported the game to PC and they upscaled it to like 1080,

486
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:59,939
right? Tony Hawk is on PC. Tony Hawk 2 is not on PC. They did like a remaster of Tony Hawk 1,

487
02:10:59,939 --> 02:11:07,100
and it was kind of lukewarm. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is not on PC. It's only on the

488
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:32,520
consoles. I mean, yes it is. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is on PC. What? Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 PC?

489
02:11:38,539 --> 02:11:43,579
Oh, but it's an, okay, it's an old Windows game. And you know how hellish it can be

490
02:11:43,579 --> 02:11:52,090
sometimes to get those to run. I guess it is on PC. Does it actually work on like Windows 10?

491
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:13,060
All right, here's carrier. It doesn't work on Windows 10. Just get a virtual box. Yeah,

492
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:18,819
but if I already have a Dreamcast here, do I really want to make like a virtual emulation

493
02:12:18,819 --> 02:12:23,060
machine to play Tony Hawk 2 when I already have it here and this is arguably the best version

494
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:32,359
is the one on Dreamcast? Why is there somebody's, somebody has a website in the corner.

495
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:46,489
Why? Why did they shoot us down? Leonard, Lieutenant Manning. Am I the only one that made

496
02:12:46,489 --> 02:12:58,939
it? Is that Leonard? So the opening, I didn't press start yet though. That's like the demo

497
02:12:58,939 --> 02:13:12,869
screen. Carrier. Everybody did the Resident Evil. When you press start, it says the name.

498
02:13:15,539 --> 02:13:30,100
Whatever, let's just go. By the beginning of the 21st century, the North-South conflict had

499
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:35,140
escalated to military confrontation. Which North-South? The people of the countries of the South

500
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:39,859
faced with an energy crisis and a food shortage had developed a deep-seated hatred.

501
02:13:39,859 --> 02:13:44,659
Is this just generic country names? And as a result, anti-North terrorist groups began to show up

502
02:13:44,659 --> 02:13:50,010
all over the world. In response, the countries of the North joined together to create the

503
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:56,329
Northern Hemisphere Treaty Alliance, NTA. The goal of this organization was to stop the

504
02:13:56,329 --> 02:14:03,689
Southern terrorists. In 2023, the NTA completed construction of the Heimdall aircraft carrier.

505
02:14:04,329 --> 02:14:08,489
With its stage defense system and connection to the satellite defense system,

506
02:14:08,489 --> 02:14:13,529
the Heimdall is like a steel wall, invulnerable to any sort of air-based attack.

507
02:14:14,489 --> 02:14:19,050
The first mission for the Heimdall was to attack the base of the Southern Cross terrorist group.

508
02:14:19,689 --> 02:14:24,970
This was called the Hurricane Mission. During an attack that lasted only a few days,

509
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:29,369
the base was completely destroyed and the Heimdall was able to head back to its home

510
02:14:29,369 --> 02:14:35,770
port in North America. However, approximately two days of travel from port, the Heimdall fell

511
02:14:35,770 --> 02:14:42,729
silent, failing to respond to any communication from NTA. Concerned about the Heimdall,

512
02:14:42,729 --> 02:14:46,810
a Spark investigation team was put together and sent to determine what happened.

513
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:32,600
Oh boy.

514
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:42,180
That was a full, almost three seconds of no-lips-and-mouth.

515
02:16:01,399 --> 02:16:05,829
Somebody turn the vacuum off, I want to hear the dialogue please.

516
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:11,340
I don't see anyone on the flight.

517
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:15,020
Dad is mowing the lawn right next to your window and you're in a goddamn

518
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:21,989
intense 3D3 League of Legends match and you're getting so irritated. He goes away,

519
02:16:21,989 --> 02:16:31,020
he's on his fucking riding mower and he's driving away and you're gonna mute your fucking

520
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:38,819
mic. Mute. Oh, here we go. It goes by you unmute your friends, dad.

521
02:16:38,819 --> 02:16:58,870
He couldn't hear anything I was saying. Well, case in point, good. I'm glad the game

522
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:11,719
would make the point. I'm happy to give this game about 25 minutes.

523
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:19,989
You just tried to tell a joke with your dad mowing the lawn. Yes, I, exactly.

524
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:27,139
This is the maddest I've ever been. This is the maddest I've ever been in a video game.

525
02:17:28,329 --> 02:17:30,729
Stupid, it's stupid. This game's fucking stupid.

526
02:17:48,329 --> 02:17:51,879
Leonard. So we're gonna get the big reveal to see what happened to Leonard.

527
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:04,180
Are you okay? No, he's okay. Hang on. Looks like my leg's no good.

528
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:12,329
Your leg? Don't move it. I'll take care of it. This is Colonel Burke.

529
02:18:12,329 --> 02:18:17,319
Smart team, do you copy? Colonel Burke. Those goggles. Jack, you're a bit late.

530
02:18:17,319 --> 02:18:21,639
He won't do anything. Have you finally landed? Colonel, the helicopter was attacked.

531
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:28,540
What? Colonel, the helicopter was attacked. So that was the big point.

532
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:31,340
He has giant ski goggles on. It must be the work of Southern Cross.

533
02:18:32,059 --> 02:18:35,819
We don't know about that. We must begin the investigation.

534
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:40,940
And the other members? Are they okay? I don't know where Lieutenant Manning is.

535
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:45,819
She's disappeared. The pilot Leonard is with me now, but he's badly injured.

536
02:18:45,819 --> 02:18:50,299
I see. See if you can find a first aid kit and do what you can for Leonard.

537
02:18:50,299 --> 02:18:54,500
When you're done, begin your investigation. Yes, sir.

538
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:58,899
I don't know what's going on, but it's clear that things are not what they seem.

539
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:02,420
Maybe Leonard is safer than a flight. Make a Resident Evil 2 joke?

540
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:06,739
Yeah, I'll leave him here. I'll check the ship and bring back any first aid supplies.

541
02:19:06,739 --> 02:19:08,020
I can't. I haven't played it.

542
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:11,940
I'm counting on you. We'll get back to the investigation on this end.

543
02:19:12,739 --> 02:19:17,059
Lang should be checking the ship data in the security room. When you're done,

544
02:19:17,059 --> 02:19:21,940
catch up with him and see what he's discovered. Then continue your investigation.

545
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:26,979
Yes, sir, Colonel. Be careful. Wait for me, Leonard. I'll get a first aid kit.

546
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:41,190
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Apologizing. Okay.

547
02:19:42,069 --> 02:19:54,579
Do I have control of the character now? Is this going to be another tank controls game?

548
02:19:55,540 --> 02:20:00,020
We just walk around and shoot the one zombie that shows up and then grab the health kit.

549
02:20:01,139 --> 02:20:31,540
I'm glad we're getting it out of the way. No scream. What happened?

550
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:36,440
It's his head.

551
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:49,399
His head? Oh, no. Okay.

552
02:20:52,059 --> 02:21:10,659
So let's plug us. I love that bird mouth.

553
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:23,260
What the hell's going on? Leonard was by that. Please work.

554
02:21:37,219 --> 02:21:41,319
Leonard, I'm sorry. I wish I could have done something.

555
02:21:42,649 --> 02:21:47,139
The eyes shifting back and forth. All right. Time for.

556
02:21:52,569 --> 02:22:03,100
What the hell is going on here? How do I? Okay. How do I shoot?

557
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:47,319
Hey, dead. Yeah, it's just tank controls. Actually, not that bad. All right. Upstairs.

558
02:22:53,079 --> 02:23:00,309
Dollar store of Resident Evil. Well, more like $2 store or 30 or $40 on Amazon store.

559
02:23:01,959 --> 02:23:06,940
At least 10. This was at least $10 in the Amazon dollar store.

560
02:23:15,379 --> 02:23:30,540
Port side elevator. That's an impractically not long name for a store.

561
02:23:33,399 --> 02:23:39,180
Raided. We got a raid. What? Who came in with the raid?

562
02:23:55,079 --> 02:24:07,260
I see General Sam. General Sam, thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody. General Sam.

563
02:24:11,299 --> 02:24:15,780
Of those of you that are just joining us, this game, this is not something that you're

564
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:19,299
typically going to see on this channel. It's not a good representation. Yes, it is.

565
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:22,360
Welcome to the stream. Hope you had a good one, General Sam.

566
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:30,069
This is not a good representation of what the stream is.

567
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:41,079
It's usually not. I'm usually not playing a game like this. Usually I'm playing Dota 2 or

568
02:24:44,379 --> 02:24:47,899
cards in real life. Just cards, playing cards with a friend.

569
02:24:49,819 --> 02:25:02,870
A3 lock is written above the key slot. Okay, go down here. Look at how dark this is.

570
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:15,219
What does it say? Deck 1 security room and medical. A1 written on the lock.

571
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:27,700
Okay, slow down. It's just blue stinger, but slightly better. Yep, hold on.

572
02:25:40,299 --> 02:25:42,059
Such passion. Such fear.

573
02:25:47,899 --> 02:25:52,059
Somebody knocked on your hotel door and you walked up and asked that question.

574
02:26:17,899 --> 02:26:19,979
We don't figure out what's going on soon.

575
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:26,379
Anyway, the Colonel's on deck three. Dr. Noble should be on his way to the lower decks,

576
02:26:26,379 --> 02:26:30,540
but I haven't heard from him for now. We need to join the Colonel.

577
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:36,219
Yes, sir. I'm trying to open the partition to deck two, but I need two more activation discs.

578
02:26:37,579 --> 02:26:41,340
There are two more discs like this one on deck one, some old, old,

579
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:47,899
old. Stupid. Where's the thumb drive? Stupid dumb old game. Where's the thumb drive, idiot?

580
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:53,670
Right? Yes, sir. There should be an ID card in the medical room in this area.

581
02:26:54,229 --> 02:26:58,309
Here, take this. You should stock up on medicines in case of an emergency.

582
02:26:58,870 --> 02:27:19,700
Yes, sir. This computer's running wild. It won't tell me anything about the ship.

583
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:25,780
The security lock is complicated. What a pain. You better bring those discs soon.

584
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:33,129
There's not much time. Somebody just said I missed the kind old lady,

585
02:27:33,129 --> 02:27:37,370
Jerma. What? No, I've read that completely wrong. The old Jerma that used to walk

586
02:27:37,370 --> 02:27:48,040
old ladies across the street. When did I do that? Does this do anything? Do you want to...

587
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:54,540
No. There's something over here. A security system console seems to be active. There's a

588
02:27:54,540 --> 02:28:04,090
something spinning around over there. Just... that's it. A A3 ID card obtained and

589
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:11,559
DV tape obtained. That's how you know this is old. Doesn't help old ladies? Of course I do.

590
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:15,159
If I'm on the sidewalk and an old lady comes up and she says,

591
02:28:15,159 --> 02:28:22,229
Ah, excuse me. Could I please add bother you? I say, yes, of course. What's... what is it, man?

592
02:28:23,110 --> 02:28:29,110
I'm looking to go across this walkway here and I need a little bit of help.

593
02:28:29,829 --> 02:28:35,270
I go, absolutely, ma'am. Of course. And we get to the end and we slowly go across and make

594
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:41,030
sure that, you know, she's stabilized and has enough room to go. We get across and

595
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:45,670
she gives like a little a little hug like, Oh, thank you, my my wonderful boy. And you're like,

596
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:50,149
Oh, have a great day, ma'am. And then like two or three hours later, you go into your wallet

597
02:28:50,149 --> 02:28:54,790
because you're buying a drink. You're buying a round for all your friends. And like 60 bucks

598
02:28:54,790 --> 02:29:18,729
is gone. That's why I don't do it. What the fuck is going on in here? What happened?

599
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:20,729
For a second, I saw a dinosaur face.

600
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:28,409
Here comes the scientist.

601
02:29:30,489 --> 02:29:31,850
Then here's the fucked up scientist.

602
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:37,370
I'm Sergeant Ingles. I'm part of the Spark team sent to investigate the ship. What are you doing

603
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:45,829
here? Spark? You're a little too late. This is not a human anymore. Here, take a look with this.

604
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:58,090
What is it? VR goggles. Okay, the BEM T3N scope. Developed by the NTA for infantry in the

605
02:29:58,090 --> 02:30:03,049
case of biological warfare, can be used to identify non-human life forms. See in the

606
02:30:03,049 --> 02:30:12,340
dark and see through some objects. Do I really have to scan this guy to find out that he's a

607
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:27,770
zombie? Scanning. Danger. What's going on? What is going on? What you see? Somebody gave 50

608
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:38,649
dollars a long time ago. What? How did I miss this? I was finally able to capture one of

609
02:30:39,209 --> 02:30:44,809
these things alive and conduct some experiments, but the ship is already full of them.

610
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:50,569
What? I tried to analyze this one, but it's too late. I was getting my ass kicked.

611
02:30:52,090 --> 02:31:00,489
Oh, that's right. I was engrossed in self-pity playing Power Stone. Hey, what are you doing?

612
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:12,149
It, it is all because of Ark. Ark? This monster looks like a human, but, but it's not. It's

613
02:31:12,149 --> 02:31:21,530
an inferior life form. Hey, stop. Are you crazy? I thought I just shot him.

614
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:28,500
Those bombs, those chains were not bound very well. Like,

615
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:47,659
human. He's dead. Three, two, one. You're a very bad shot. You're terrible. Hey, wait,

616
02:31:47,659 --> 02:31:57,190
what are you talking about? He can fit like four times. You have arrived in hell.

617
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:17,670
He did the, okay. Well, I wasn't really ready for that.

618
02:32:18,549 --> 02:32:29,989
Okay, that, am I stuck in a time loop here? Why did he just reverse time?

619
02:32:33,719 --> 02:32:41,239
Uh, A1 ID card. I needed that. Anything else in the room? There it is. Record of research

620
02:32:41,959 --> 02:32:53,700
by Terry Adams. Somebody else. What? Carrots? What just fell out?

621
02:32:56,090 --> 02:33:07,059
An evil carrot just jumped out at me. What? There's more? More Nickelodeon Splat sound

622
02:33:07,059 --> 02:33:26,579
effects, too. If you keep them scored. Can I please shoot this? If I die to the

623
02:33:26,579 --> 02:33:41,370
fucking Nickelodeon carrot, I'm gonna be very upset. Okay. Nothing, there's nothing useful here.

624
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:57,930
So let's go. I got the A1 card. Do I have any healing items? A1 is down this way.

625
02:34:03,350 --> 02:34:12,500
Use energy drink. Yep, use it. That's not very much health. All right, equip, uh, where's

626
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:27,139
my, is my helmet? No, don't welder. Look. Okay, use it. Just turned everything kind of sepia. Uh oh.

627
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:40,180
At least there are enemies in this game. The last two survival horror games we played,

628
02:34:41,719 --> 02:34:56,540
people barely had to, there was no enemies. All right, what's in here? Let's find out.

629
02:34:56,540 --> 02:35:03,930
Which ones were survival horror? Uh, the ring. The ring was one of them. What? Then blue stinger.

630
02:35:04,809 --> 02:35:17,180
That's not even a survival horror. Hoygel was horror, maybe. Everything's covered with plants.

631
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:33,370
The bird? Okay, this is a jump scare. There's an octopus giant plant octopus thing in here.

632
02:35:44,149 --> 02:35:50,069
Yes, I'm checking the aircraft hangars. The wavelengths aren't even matched up either.

633
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:56,629
Leonard? Well, at least match up the wavelengths. He was attacked and killed by some creature on

634
02:35:56,629 --> 02:36:03,350
the flight deck. What? I couldn't get to him in time. I'm so sorry. No, there's nothing to

635
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:18,389
object about. Colonel. Sorry, this is no time to get emotional. Yes, sir. He came down and

636
02:36:18,389 --> 02:36:25,930
attacked me, so I killed it. Stop using your voice. The elevator was damaged, so I couldn't

637
02:36:25,930 --> 02:36:30,010
go up and check until I went below. It was just me and Leonard on the flight deck.

638
02:36:30,809 --> 02:36:34,090
I don't know we're the creature that attacked Leonard. Just start humming it in your head

639
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:39,530
because it's going to come soon enough. There's no sense for fussing and fighting, my friend.

640
02:36:42,729 --> 02:36:45,530
Yes, sir. Do you have any idea what's going on?

641
02:36:47,610 --> 02:37:02,579
I saw a human turn into some sort of monster. I don't know. Let's do it. Yes, sir.

642
02:37:03,559 --> 02:37:06,120
What happened to the creature that attacked you? It came down and attacked me.

643
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:37,799
All right, we're going speed run. One death, permanent death. Head gone. Perfect. Nothing

644
02:37:37,799 --> 02:37:51,020
over here. Another cut scene. Radio room. This thing's going to jump up. Hey, what do

645
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:56,620
you think you're doing? I'm too late. Heimdall, why did you attack the Spark

646
02:37:56,620 --> 02:38:05,319
helicopter of NTA Central? He thought that guy was alive. Deactivate the intercept system

647
02:38:05,319 --> 02:38:18,629
and stop the ship. He's angry at that guy. Heimdall, respond. Stop the ship.

648
02:38:18,629 --> 02:38:24,219
This is Sergeant Ingalls from Spark. Spark, okay. Our helicopter was destroyed during

649
02:38:24,219 --> 02:38:32,229
an emergency landing. Stop. Hey, what the hell went on? Over here in Chicago,

650
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:48,760
what's going on? We're calling from a long ways away. Damn. That was the essentially all

651
02:38:48,760 --> 02:39:02,600
that guy's dialogue. Nothing in here that I can need to grab or touch or do.

652
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:06,659
Dead body in the chair. He must have been attacked while using the transmitter. Okay.

653
02:39:06,899 --> 02:39:27,850
Muzzle flash just flashed light, you're right. But, all right, let's see. There's a door over

654
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:50,360
this way. No, that's just the way I came. I gotta go till you die. What if I just don't

655
02:39:50,360 --> 02:40:02,540
die? That would be really unfortunate for all of us. Who are you? What? I'm Sergeant Ingalls.

656
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:07,260
I'm part of the Spark team sent by NTA. Man, you were lucky to make it this far.

657
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:10,219
Was the intercept system deactivated? How's he going to shoot this guy? No, it destroyed the

658
02:40:10,219 --> 02:40:17,030
helicopter we came in on. It's hopeless. It's impossible to leave. Don't give up. We'll

659
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:22,309
deactivate the system somehow. Do you know where it is? Man, it's in the weapons control

660
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:27,670
room on deck six, but it's going to be hell to get there. Trust me, we'll get there.

661
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:30,790
Evacuate to the flight deck and wait for help from the command center. He's got a good

662
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:34,549
YouTuber voice. Hey, we're counting on you, Sarge. This should come in handy in your

663
02:40:34,549 --> 02:40:55,819
mission. Yeah, it does. It's the second one. That's what I needed. Can't do it. Let's go.

664
02:40:56,620 --> 02:41:04,340
How do I find these games? Well, this is just on Dreamcast. This is only on Dreamcast.

665
02:41:05,829 --> 02:41:11,370
And the last couple of nights we've been playing Dreamcast games. It's the most defining,

666
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:32,889
genre-defining even. Video games came from the Dreamcast, and we're seeing why. What? He

667
02:41:32,889 --> 02:41:39,989
went right for the neck. Iron Gate. Looks like it would take a bomb to open it. It's locked. A2.

668
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:55,319
This might end very quickly. Is there another door?

669
02:42:00,329 --> 02:42:04,329
People act like PS2 didn't have bad games. No, Dreamcast has a lot of great games.

670
02:42:07,719 --> 02:42:20,729
Pull the door. I went all the way to the end. Look at this great game. Well, this is not a

671
02:42:20,729 --> 02:42:42,540
look at this great game. This is look at this exclusive. Go this way. Well, I've only

672
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:48,299
played the bad ones. Well, because all the good ones are ported to PC. So stuff like Shenmue is

673
02:42:48,299 --> 02:42:57,059
just a better version on PC. Jet Set Radio is on PC. Sonic Adventure is on PC. Space Channel 5 is

674
02:42:57,059 --> 02:43:02,340
on PC. And those games are a lot of money. So I got the ports for those ones, and then we're

675
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:07,379
going to play them. But these are the physical disks that you can't get anywhere else unless

676
02:43:07,379 --> 02:43:14,709
you emulate these games. Space Channel 5, yeah, is on PC. I didn't I was completely unaware of

677
02:43:14,709 --> 02:43:21,829
that as well. I was shocked when I saw like the actual Dreamcast collection on Steam. It's on

678
02:43:21,829 --> 02:43:36,309
Steam. Where was I back there? Yeah, Dreamcast Sonic Adventure is probably better. But I mean,

679
02:43:36,309 --> 02:43:47,030
I can still get it. Let me go through this door. Sonic Adventure is actual dog shit if

680
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:57,340
you haven't played it recently. Now I'm scared. Hey, what happened? There's something over there.

681
02:43:57,899 --> 02:43:59,430
Somebody hiding behind a locker?

682
02:44:03,909 --> 02:44:18,500
What happened? Who is this? Is that me? I don't see anything. Did that guy run into the locker

683
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:24,149
and then the game delayed his fall down by 10 straight seconds? Or was he supposed to get

684
02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:37,159
sucked in and grabbed into the locker? No, it's an invisible man. What? The scope.

685
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:55,159
Oh, he's going to use the infrared. Good. Don't use my bullets. I'll take care of it. You stay in

686
02:44:55,159 --> 02:45:20,420
the locker. It's okay. You can come out. You're Jack, Bob's brother. You know Bob?

687
02:45:21,219 --> 02:45:27,819
I know Bob. Yeah, he runs the dog stand down the fucking street. You must be Eddie from

688
02:45:27,819 --> 02:45:37,399
Bob's outfit. You got it. I'm glad you're okay. Was Bob with you? I lost track of him when

689
02:45:37,399 --> 02:45:46,250
the mutants came. Yeah, I lost track of Bob. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm glad to see you're

690
02:45:46,250 --> 02:45:54,219
okay. It's not safe here. You should go to the flight deck. Okay. Be careful, Sergeant.

691
02:45:55,020 --> 02:46:11,930
Thanks. Hurry. Yeah. Medkit, we still go. I go until I die.

692
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:25,350
We go until I... never mind. I thought about it for a second.

693
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:45,879
Use the heal. I have six shots left. Full stream of carrier incoming. I don't think that's

694
02:46:45,879 --> 02:47:10,469
going to happen. R2? No, just run. The game doesn't look that bad. It is not that bad.

695
02:47:10,469 --> 02:47:18,629
None of these games are that bad. These games came out before some of you guys were even

696
02:47:18,629 --> 02:47:34,620
born. So you gotta give a little bit of credit. Just run. What's wrong with me?

697
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:42,739
Why did I just do that? Did I just puke? Did I just like shit my pants and say no?

698
02:48:04,549 --> 02:48:12,809
It's you without a mustache. Who do I shoot? Who do I shoot? I made the right call.

699
02:48:12,809 --> 02:48:25,610
It's a good thing you're able to figure it out. How you doing? I'm Alan. I'm Sergeant

700
02:48:25,610 --> 02:48:30,809
Inglis from SPARC. I'm asking all survivors to go to the flight deck. You should go there

701
02:48:30,809 --> 02:48:37,530
too. The flight deck? There are no safe places left on this here ship. Well,

702
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:42,809
you must have noticed by now the whole ship is screwed up, son. It's impossible to tell

703
02:48:42,809 --> 02:48:49,530
who's on our side and who is not. You can't trust anyone but yourself. I hope it's facial

704
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:54,729
here. Thanks, but I'll make my own decisions. That's how you want it. Good luck. I've got

705
02:48:54,729 --> 02:49:00,569
work to do. Be careful. You too. Here, you better take this. By the way, son,

706
02:49:01,129 --> 02:49:08,329
thanks for saving my butt. Three energy drinks. Level three. No, level three energy

707
02:49:08,569 --> 02:49:11,459
whatever it was. That's a full heal.

708
02:49:21,659 --> 02:49:32,409
All right, what we got? Control panel. Is it ammo? What is it? Activation disc obtained.

709
02:49:34,739 --> 02:50:07,639
For what room? Activation disc. I just healed too. Really? What is- oh, the invisible guys. I

710
02:50:07,639 --> 02:50:27,559
forgot about the stupid invisibility bullshit. Excuse me. No other doors. There's one right

711
02:50:27,559 --> 02:50:44,250
here. God damn it. Kill him. Everybody wants me to lose so bad. Everybody's rooting for me to

712
02:50:44,250 --> 02:51:13,059
lose. This is spooky. Come on. All right, we got our first major encounter, I think. How's the

713
02:51:13,059 --> 02:51:30,700
speed around looking? Somebody said this game hurts to look at. It is an old game.

714
02:51:31,340 --> 02:52:00,379
Nothing over here. God damn tank. It has no lighting and zero art direction. It's kind of

715
02:52:00,379 --> 02:52:08,200
a blob, isn't it? Is there a reason to come out here? There's a two-hour speedrun of this game.

716
02:52:10,219 --> 02:52:20,260
How long is the game itself then? Two hours for a speedrun. This game's probably like 15

717
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:27,590
to 20 hours long. Well, I'm looking forward to it because there's no way I'm gonna die.

718
02:52:28,389 --> 02:52:34,870
Well, then he dies when he gets up to the top of the ladder. Wouldn't that be funny?

719
02:52:47,989 --> 02:52:56,309
All right, going up Shadow Moses. Wait till I get my codec call.

720
02:53:05,959 --> 02:53:13,319
Sir, this is Jack. Sir, I'm on my way to the bridge. The partition for the corridor to deck

721
02:53:13,319 --> 02:53:18,120
two is closed. Captain Lang is in the security room trying to open and I'm looking for the

722
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:46,780
necessary discs. E-7 bomb. Deck one weapon storage. Can't they just turn those lights on?

723
02:53:47,500 --> 02:54:09,719
Is there a pair of underwear? No. Yeah, there was that door downstairs that needed a bomb.

724
02:54:10,360 --> 02:54:25,459
That guy's gonna stand up after I grab the disc. Ship's log. That's a full month. Visibility's good

725
02:54:25,459 --> 02:54:35,940
and the radar is still operating. We're gonna get a good view of the... Don't trust anybody.

726
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:57,020
Still raining. Doesn't look like it will stop soon. Okay. Well, like he was probably alive.

727
02:54:57,020 --> 02:55:01,420
Well, I don't know. I saw a guy and had to shoot. If I get hit one more time, I'm dead.

728
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:19,350
Yeah, that's the... that's not the Wilhelm scream. That's called the tantrum scream.

729
02:55:20,729 --> 02:55:33,780
Is that what it is? Stay away from me. Calm down. I'm part of the spark team. Spark team? Yeah,

730
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:38,340
we're evacuating survivors to the flight deck. This guy's a liar. Do you know

731
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:43,059
a pilot named Bob Ingalls? Bob? He's my brother. Shoot this guy. I think I've heard

732
02:55:43,059 --> 02:55:47,940
the name somewhere, but... Hmm. You know, maybe if you check the crew list using the

733
02:55:47,940 --> 02:55:52,500
terminal here, you'll find something. I see. I'll check it later. Do you know where the

734
02:55:52,500 --> 02:56:10,889
weapon storage is? It is. Why? Why was that used in every form of media? Was it there as a

735
02:56:10,889 --> 02:56:33,579
joke? It was just an inside joke. I'm not doing so hot. There we go. Energy drink.

736
02:56:33,579 --> 02:56:48,280
Use energy drink. Look at that. I really had one HP. So I gotta go down to A... A2, right?

737
02:56:57,850 --> 02:57:09,530
There's a map. Look at the map. Where's the map? Where's the map? A2 doors. I need like an A2 map.

738
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:17,450
No one's paying attention. No one's paying attention.

739
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:26,139
I actually... I don't think it's that bad. I think it's actually not bad.

740
02:57:37,110 --> 02:57:45,700
It's the Tony Hawk waiting room. Don't you worry. I will show you a 1 million point string.

741
02:57:46,340 --> 02:57:53,959
You understand? Now, I would like somebody to cut from what I just said right there.

742
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:59,399
About 30 minutes from now, potentially, when I am repeating over and over again.

743
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:06,620
It's fucking impossible. Like, it's very... It's stupid. In fact, overlay my voice. Ready?

744
02:58:06,620 --> 02:58:13,350
I'll go for it. It's just the controls are fucking dumb. Like, I press the button,

745
02:58:13,350 --> 02:58:22,819
it didn't do anything. Like, it just doesn't really hold up. Oh my fucking god. This is

746
02:58:22,819 --> 02:58:32,170
so stupid. How? I clearly was grinding that rail. I just... It's so unbearable. Okay,

747
02:58:32,170 --> 02:58:43,350
so I would like for you guys to clip that over. Just lay it on top of it.

748
02:58:43,350 --> 02:59:04,629
Better actor than people in the game. Okay, I need door A2. What game is this? This is...

749
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:16,459
I can't... I gotta... Nope. How's that for a Tony Hawk rail grind? Oh yeah, here's another

750
02:59:16,459 --> 02:59:20,780
great one. This is another classic. I'm sorry, guys. I just... I don't have it today. I just

751
02:59:20,780 --> 02:59:24,860
don't... I don't have it. I'm gonna try this one more time and then we'll see what happens.

752
02:59:25,659 --> 02:59:39,860
That's a classic, right? No, I need A2. Is that an A2 door right there? Oh,

753
02:59:39,860 --> 02:59:48,459
the invisible guy. Shit. Do I have any more heals? I don't.

754
02:59:48,459 --> 02:59:56,870
No, don't rip around that way. Go! Wasn't there a locked door like over here?

755
03:00:06,600 --> 03:00:16,329
The map is in the menu. Pause menu. Oh, okay. Where the hell even am I? I don't know what deck

756
03:00:16,329 --> 03:00:24,200
I'm on. Okay, I'm right there. So I gotta go... Ah, this is not even that bad of a game. It

757
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:35,659
just isn't. So I gotta go out and then through. Is that A2, though? Radio room. Main passageway.

758
03:00:35,659 --> 03:00:47,559
So I gotta go down the hall and through the door on the left. So I'm in the wrong room.

759
03:00:47,559 --> 03:00:54,520
But can I heal in here? All right, so it's the door on the left. I don't know if I'm

760
03:00:54,520 --> 03:01:22,440
gonna make it through this door. Shit. Why is this not playing? I had to queue it up, too.

761
03:01:25,049 --> 03:01:39,829
All right, let's get Tony Hawk rolling. This game is kind of cool. It was. It wasn't that bad.

762
03:01:39,829 --> 03:01:43,989
It was... The game gave you those key cards and you just had to kind of see where the

763
03:01:43,989 --> 03:01:48,389
doors were locked. It wasn't confusing. It was... If I gave a shit, I would probably sit

764
03:01:48,389 --> 03:01:56,360
there and play it for a while. He's getting defensive about this sucky game. What? I think

765
03:01:56,360 --> 03:02:04,069
it's fun. But this is what everybody came here for. The best version of Tony Hawk Pro

766
03:02:04,069 --> 03:02:08,549
Skater 2, if you ask any expert in the industry, ask anybody in the field, you ask anybody in your

767
03:02:08,549 --> 03:02:15,110
friend group, anybody that you know. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast is the best

768
03:02:15,110 --> 03:02:22,969
version of the game. That is just a fact and we're about to play. Somebody just said wrong.

769
03:02:25,270 --> 03:02:36,920
I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to disagree with you. And the disc is not in

770
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:43,700
here. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 inside here is actually... There's a mistake. The disc is

771
03:02:43,700 --> 03:03:00,379
not in here. This is actually Shenmue 2 is in here. So I got scammed. Let's go put it in and

772
03:03:00,379 --> 03:03:11,219
see what happens. All right, let's actually rename this Tony Hawk because I'm gonna be

773
03:03:11,219 --> 03:03:18,340
here for a while because I love this game. This is no longer just a straight up Dreamcast

774
03:03:19,139 --> 03:03:33,459
fuckface stream. This is now a Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 stream. And I'm looking forward to it

775
03:03:33,459 --> 03:03:46,680
because it's a great game. Now the real stream begins. But I want to touch... Stormy Chu gave

776
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:52,360
$50 earlier and I need to address it because that's a lot of money. Pizza hut burgers taste

777
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:57,959
like boogies and you know it's true. Hungry Howies is superior in every way. Also need

778
03:03:57,959 --> 03:04:00,920
to remind you that you're the best streamer and can always make me and Chad have a good

779
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:09,159
laugh. That's good. Thank you. I've never heard of Hungry Howies. I don't know where that is.

780
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:16,459
By the way, Rip Vod is a rest in peace to the Vod. But I'm not going to turn the music

781
03:04:16,459 --> 03:04:23,059
off in this game because it's one of the major parts to play it. So sorry.

782
03:04:26,069 --> 03:04:37,420
This is the best Tony Hawk. This is the classic. It's the best. They will never make

783
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:43,290
a better skating game than Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. And everyone that wants to argue

784
03:04:43,290 --> 03:04:47,860
what about Skate 3? Well, I've never played it. So I've heard it was okay.

785
03:04:49,139 --> 03:05:06,299
All right. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. Let's get some stuff going here. I could create a...

786
03:05:06,299 --> 03:05:09,579
If I could... Want me to do like a full career? Yes, of course I'm going to do that. Welcome

787
03:05:09,579 --> 03:05:17,610
to the next eight hours. I can't wait. I'm so excited. I actually am. I've been waiting

788
03:05:17,610 --> 03:05:27,129
a long time to get this greencast controller in my hand for this. But unfortunately that's

789
03:05:27,129 --> 03:05:31,129
going to be the end of this night's stream because I have some stuff I got to do tomorrow.

790
03:05:31,850 --> 03:05:40,809
But really though, I'm going to go pee and I'm going to get myself prepared. I'll be right back.
