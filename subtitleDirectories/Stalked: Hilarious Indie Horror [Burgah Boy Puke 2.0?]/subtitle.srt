00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,619
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Germa here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:21,620
Gonna be playing Stalked tonight, and special guest, of course, you see him in the background, is Shit-Faced Burger Boy.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,100
He went to a beer tasting, a beer drinking competition today. He drank like 40 beers in 10 seconds.

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,590
Anyways, we're playing Stalked tonight, which we are recording this after we actually played the game.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,590
And I do have to say very, very explicitly, stay and watch this whole video.

6
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,590
Because it is like the most hysterical friggin' game I've ever played in my life.

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,829
And just the- what are you doing?

8
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:54,630
Hello, wake up, follow me. Stalker's here. It will kill us.

9
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,630
This is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,579
Reach the elevator and get out of here. Never look at the stalker.

11
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,579
Never look at the stalker. Come on, we have to- come on, we have to get out of here.

12
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:09,579
Oh my god! That is the best animation I've ever seen!

13
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,939
Look at this guy's legs!

14
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,700
Wow.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Oh my god! That guy just died!

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
That was actually kinda scary.

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,939
Can I take his gun? Did I say the game was called Stalker or Stalked?

18
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,430
Because I think it's Stalked.

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,430
Give me your gun.

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,250
Come on, we have to get out of here.

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
This guy really is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,060
Okay, sure, I can't pick up the shotgun.

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,819
Oh, sick like meat.

24
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,819
Oh, that's like a person.

25
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,819
That's like half up a torso.

26
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,819
Oh, there's another one on the left and the right.

27
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,819
I think that's like both halves.

28
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,819
Geez, that's pretty gross.

29
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,950
He said never look at the stalker, so I have to like look away from him.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,950
This reminds me of like Doom.

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,950
There he is.

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,950
Yeah, this really does remind me of Doom. It like looks just like Doom.

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
It really does.

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,539
Can I- can I go over here?

35
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,539
What?

36
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,539
No, it's just like a dead body rotating.

37
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:28,139
This is like- this would be scary right now.

38
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,659
What the hell is going on?

39
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,659
It's like claymation.

40
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,020
High fighter!

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm not even sure what I'm actually supposed to be doing right now.

42
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,710
Specimen.

43
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:56,060
You know, in all- even if like the graphics are crappy,

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,849
they have like half torsos hanging up.

45
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,849
I know.

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,849
Even if the- it kind of reminds me of like NSFW.

47
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,849
What?

48
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:06,849
What was that?

49
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,849
Like blood stains on the wall.

50
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,090
Did you see like that flash of that like thing?

51
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,090
I got a feeling he's gonna sprint right at me right now.

52
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,460
No, there he is.

53
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Don't look at him.

54
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Do not look at him.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
That's the goal, huh?

56
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:27,650
The goal is do not look at the stalker.

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,650
Well then how did you know he was behind you?

58
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,819
You freak.

59
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,819
I didn't.

60
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,819
I just saw him.

61
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,819
You didn't see him?

62
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,819
No.

63
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,819
