00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,629
What is going on guys? Jerma here with a V-Log.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:08,550
Quick little update. I just want to let you guys know what's going on with the channel.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,580
I want to keep you guys in the loop. So a lot of you guys have probably noticed by now there are

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,039
ads on the videos. There are pre-roll ads and stuff like that. And that's because as of right now,

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,800
I am a machinima partner. And it's unbelievable to me guys. I really can't believe it.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,770
And I got nobody to thank but all the people that support the channel.

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,179
You guys did this. I mean yeah, I make the content but you guys watch and you guys are always

8
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,659
supporting and you guys are always so helpful. You guys are always so awesome. Thank you all so

9
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:51,350
much. All my subscribers. You guys are fantastic. Unbelievable. And I also got to thank the guys

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,350
over at Respawn at the Respawn app. You guys are just as awesome because if it's not for you guys,

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,189
maybe I wouldn't even be seen. You know, maybe something like that would have happened. But

12
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:06,200
all the guys, all the employees at Machinima, I'm not going to let you down. I can promise you that.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,060
And I'm going to start to take this channel a lot more seriously. I'm going to be making content at

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,379
the absolute best amount I can make it. The highest amount of quality I can put into it.

15
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:21,459
And I'm going to continue doing that. And hopefully you guys stick around. Hopefully you guys

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,760
are going to keep with me. Stay with the channel for a long time to come. So thank you all so much

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,780
everybody. You don't know what it means to me. The second announcement is I have an official

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,019
Team Fortress 2 server. The link or whatever, it'll be right there. It's dedicated 24-7 in Chicago.

19
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,260
That's there for you guys. If you guys ever want to play on it, just go play. It's open to the

20
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,379
public. Anyone can play on it. With the only exception that on the weekends or every couple

21
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:57,540
weekends I'm going to be doing an open lobby. So that information will be available if you are on

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,469
the Respawn app. So I highly suggest guys go to the Respawn app and be active there. Join the

23
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,060
Respawn app. Go check out new videos. It's a great place. It's an unbelievable community.

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,870
Please guys if you haven't already go over there and just be part of the community

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,539
because it's a great place. So thank you all so much. My brain is like all over the place

26
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:26,870
the last few days trying to piece together the stuff going on up here. But

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,490
thank you so much everybody. And peace, love, and respect. See you all next time.
