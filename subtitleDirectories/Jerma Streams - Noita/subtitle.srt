1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,730
Relax, oh my god. I can't even, I can't, like, I had to, look, I sprinted out of here and took a piss as quick as I could.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:16,719
It's the fastest piss I've ever taken. I hit the, I turned on the streaming button, and then I sprinted to the bathroom as fast as I could.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,629
I'm here now. Hi. How you doing? You good? I'm not, I'm, I'm just two minutes late. I'm sorry.

4
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,909
I flip-flopped like crazy on the game today. I was gonna play

5
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:38,549
Spaceport Janitor, and then I found out that Noita has Twitch integration. It was gonna be Noita.

6
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,590
We've been, it was voted on. Noita lost. Then I voted, and it's worth a thousand votes.

7
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,250
I freaked out, and I was like, holy shit, there's Twitch integration, I wanna play it.

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,219
And then somebody said, people can, like, hack you if you turn it on. I was like, I don't wanna get hacked, so I turned it off.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
We're playing Noita today.

10
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:07,310
One person was like, dude, don't turn on the Twitch integration, you're gonna get hacked. I was like, what the fuck does that mean?

11
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:14,670
They could have just been completely fucking with me, but you got me. I was like, oh wow, Twitch integration.

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,909
Maybe we'll do that instead. Oh yeah, Pog. One person writes, hey dude, just be careful, like, you can get, like, your channel compromised with the Twitch integration, it's kind of buggy.

13
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,269
Oh, that's all it took for me just to fucking not do it.

14
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:33,040
So it's off, and now it was gonna play, but I wanna play the, it's a hundred percent true.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,480
It's a hundred percent not true. That's in no way true. God damn it. I knew, like,

16
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,390
this, this, okay, this is within

17
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:51,510
three minutes of me turning the stream on. Like, within four minutes of turning the stream on, I get a message that says, dude, fucking be careful, man, I'm serious.

18
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,750
That's not how you spell finish.

19
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,450
Can everyone just put their hands up? Everybody just stand up. Just put your hands up.

20
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:12,610
Is it still, I'll fix it. Noita means witch in Finnish. It does.

21
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,009
Somebody gave a shitload of subs and money, hold on. There you go, I fixed it.

22
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,389
Me, meyaboo just gave 50 community subs.

23
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,979
What are you doing? That's so, that's, that's a, that's an absolute shitload of money. Thank you for the 50 community subs.

24
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:40,460
That's meyaboo.

25
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:50,139
Are you high today? No, why, guys, I'm not high every day. Come on, I'm not.

26
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:00,699
You know what? Yeah, I am. Because I get to say, I'm wicked high, and that's why all the things that I do that are stupid now have an excuse.

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,810
But thank you for giving me a permanent excuse.

28
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:12,449
Forever. I could fuck up a children's puzzle for an hour straight, and then everyone's like, what the fuck is going on? Is he okay?

29
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,009
Yeah, sorry, guys.

30
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,250
I just took a little bit of CBD this morning, and people would be like, oh, okay.

31
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,090
Yeah, like weed 420 makes you like fucked up. I get it. Yeah, keep going, man. Keep going with this kid's puzzle.

32
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,729
Maybe you'll get it eventually.

33
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,729
Perfect. It works out perfectly for me.

34
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,509
What do you mean I spelled it wrong again?

35
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,590
F-I-N-I-S-H.

36
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,349
Finish.

37
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,949
What? I had it right the first time. I had it right the first time.

38
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,789
It's two N's. Those of you that were in pre-stream chat, it was two N's, wasn't it? I flipped it.

39
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,020
I had it, I actually

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,280
changed this.

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I had it two N's and I changed it.

42
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,719
You're already spelling a language wrong.

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:23,779
But anyways, thank you for the 50 fucking subs. Thank you Super Bruce for the five community subs and DestroyDude for five.

44
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,699
Let's play Noita. Are you guys ready? That still makes you stupid. No, it doesn't because I pressed the N on the keyboard wrong.

45
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,490
Turn the sub sounds back on.

46
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,209
You don't want that. Trust me. I don't want that.

47
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,970
Oh, you don't. You really don't. All right. I promise you guys one day.

48
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,449
I will do

49
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,810
a stream.

50
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,089
That is sub sounds on and TTS on too.

51
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,089
I will just do a just annoy the stream stream.

52
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:06,459
I'll do it for like a week and then it's going off forever.

53
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,970
Sellout stream.

54
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,339
And it'll be randomized sub sounds too. You'll never know what you're gonna get. I will make sure that there's like

55
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,060
like 50 different sub sounds I can play.

56
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,540
So you just it's gonna be fucked up. You're gonna have no idea what's gonna happen. I will record myself talking

57
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:32,779
and saying just insane shit. I might do like a full two minute monologue for one of them.

58
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,879
Noita is a rage game. Don't say that. Is it actually?

59
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:50,420
Don't tell me that. Is Noita a rage game? Thank god the camera wasn't on because it would have just shown me.

60
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,699
Kind of?

61
00:05:52,699 --> 00:06:00,939
Is it? It's like Binding of Isaac. Well, I love Binding of Isaac.

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,899
It's a roguelike. Is it? Oh, wow. This actually could be kind of fun. All right, you ready?

63
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:20,019
When's porn week? We talked about that yesterday already. Turn on the twitch integration. No, hold on. Not yet.

64
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,579
Let me just play first. I don't even know what this game is.

65
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,019
I don't want to turn on the twitch integration immediately and have like 50 things spammed on me when I don't know the controls of the game.

66
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,819
Select streamer mode. Okay. New game.

67
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,379
Explore a new world. The original Noita.

68
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,410
Daily run. A new day. New world. Science. I don't know that. Nightmare. Don't want that. Okay.

69
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,709
I just want to do the regular game first.

70
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,430
Yeah, I don't even know what this game is.

71
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,579
It's just been people have been telling me to play it for like three and a half months.

72
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,360
So you want me to turn on the like spam the enemy on on top of him mode?

73
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:09,069
I don't even know what left click does. Okay, here we go.

74
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:17,970
Does this game suck? But we can help you. Well, hold on. We'll see. I don't want to get hacked.

75
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,509
What came first? The chicken or the egg?

76
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,420
Definitely the egg.

77
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:43,790
Without a doubt had to be the egg. Yeah, without question. The egg then turned into

78
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,110
an alien. And that's how you get Noita. Witch.

79
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:59,810
X-Men Wolverine Origins waiting room. You better gift a thousand subs when I play that game for 10 minutes.

80
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,689
What a fucking waste of money. What? What? What?

81
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:12,029
That game is like $30 probably on eBay and I just have to sit here and what that's such a big deal to sit here and play

82
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,850
Wolverine for like an hour.

83
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:24,399
Just sitting in a chair. I think I deserve like fucking five grand and subs. Do that? What am I talking about?

84
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,370
All right. So this is oh, it's like Terraria. Um, well you can fly.

85
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:41,330
Okay, automatically right off the bat. I don't want W. I want it to be space, which is good. Is there already space?

86
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,539
Oh shit.

87
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,570
Is this processing or recharging?

88
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:57,220
Okay, cool. What about right click? Press F to kick. I thought that was a lie.

89
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,639
Okay, let's move. So what do we do?

90
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,860
What is this thing? Wand.

91
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,649
It's a bomb.

92
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,190
Oh shit. I only have two of those though. What is this thing?

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,759
Ocean. Equipped with water. Is this how you heal?

94
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,370
F.

95
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,259
Okay, I'm changing that. I gotta change that. Oh, here we go.

96
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:32,399
Uh, I need to change that. What is that? Input. Okay.

97
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:39,820
Uh, mouse. What is that? There we go. I gotta change this shit. Okay, use wand. Let up.

98
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:49,039
I want this to just be space. Only. I will accidentally hit W and it'll piss me off. Okay, left spray

99
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:56,220
from potion. Okay, left throw, right kick. Please make that something else. I can't make that any other button.

100
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:03,419
I can't make that any of my other mouse buttons. Why? Why not? I don't want it to be F.

101
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:15,570
No, not kick to mouse. Yeah, I have weird control sometimes. Okay, to interact E.

102
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,330
Next item. Next item. Select. Okay, save. Replay. What would I need to say to replay?

103
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,649
Eyes. Inventory. Wand. Shuffle.

104
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:34,159
Number one. Spells. Cast. One. Cast delay. Recharge time. Mana. Shuffle. Yes.

105
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,720
Spells. One. Cast delay. Recharge time. Max mana. Okay, so this is my items.

106
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,500
I have spells too. One and two.

107
00:10:49,019 --> 00:11:08,590
Yeah, I'm a mouse scroller. Entered the mines. What do I have to do? Why do I play? It really is Terraria.

108
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:13,649
I suck at Terraria. If there's one game I can tell you that I

109
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:20,129
cannot play to save my life, it's Terraria. You guys know how awful I am with this kind of control scheme?

110
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm gonna die in the first level and I'm gonna turn the stream off. This is Terraria, but it's hard and rage inducing.

111
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,159
Oh, come on. I'm not gonna do well at all.

112
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
What? You just have to go down?

113
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:56,179
Oh, hold on. Let's not say that yet. Am I on fire? How do I get the poison off?

114
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,940
Bring the potion.

115
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:08,320
Why is it not working? Wash yourself off.

116
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,700
Okay, so I'm wet now. That means I can take extra damage from electricity.

117
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,909
I did that on purpose. Fuck you.

118
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,919
Oh, what's this? Blow it up.

119
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,860
That's a... What? Hey!

120
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,159
Why did that not blow up?

121
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:45,570
All right, douse that fire. What the fuck is going on here?

122
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,970
What is this? Is this gas?

123
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,129
All right, whatever.

124
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:51,490
I want this heart.

125
00:12:51,490 --> 00:13:14,049
Go from a bow. I knew that was gonna explode. Whoa, this is lots of pixels.

126
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,429
Okay. Now I'm gonna douse that. Oh, there's a little indicator. That's cool.

127
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,779
That's helpful.

128
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,779
It doesn't go that far, dude.

129
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,289
Did it work?

130
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,779
Get extra max HP.

131
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,679
Increase to 125. What is this thing?

132
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,009
What is all this?

133
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,330
Wand? Press E to pick up this new wand.

134
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,940
Oh, okay. So this is shuffle no.

135
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,929
Faster recharge time. Lower cast delay and spread. Should I replace it?

136
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:12,080
Pick up a magic wand. Why is it not shooting?

137
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:30,460
Shuffle no. Wands that shuffle cast their spells in random order. The number of spells this wand casts when used. One.

138
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,179
Cast delay. Spread.

139
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,519
Spark bolt. A weak but enchanting sparkling projectile.

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,019
How come it's not shooting? What's this one?

141
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,779
Slow orb of void.

142
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,259
You mess with it in the four slots.

143
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,139
This game didn't tell me this. I don't know what the fuck's going on.

144
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,799
I don't know. Why is this not shooting though? Is it? Am I just crazy?

145
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,980
You need more mana.

146
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,539
Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. What about a chili egg?

147
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,179
Pick up a chili egg. Okay.

148
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:21,779
Okay, cool. What's this thing?

149
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,649
An invisibillium potion?

150
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:34,860
Okay. I feel like I just said that word wrong. I feel like I said invisible wrong. What does that mean?

151
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:42,929
Actually, this game's okay. I'm starting to get a hang of this.

152
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,700
It's pretty cool.

153
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Ow. I didn't even see that guy.

154
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,440
What happens if I die?

155
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,500
Minus 15 chat?

156
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,019
You get a game over.

157
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,179
Okay, this guy is firing missiles at me.

158
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,909
Okay, when the music starts. Does it mean that that's like a hard encounter when the music starts playing like this?

159
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,500
Fuck. I just put water on him?

160
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm gonna die.

161
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,820
All right. I'm good. I'm all right.

162
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,700
Do I get experience? Roll the egg. It spawns a friendly creature.

163
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh, what? That's pretty cool. All right. What's this thing do?

164
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,940
Do they follow me around?

165
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,860
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.

166
00:16:54,179 --> 00:17:03,220
Water! Put water on me. What's what's that's not water? Oh, fuck this guy. Get down there and kill him.

167
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:11,920
Go down there and hurt that guy.

168
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,890
Shit.

169
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,109
Go down there and kill him.

170
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:33,890
Ow! Hey, what the fuck?

171
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,529
Click here for stats. Cool. Okay. Progress. Six new progress?

172
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,109
Oh, Jesus. This is fucking huge.

173
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,650
Okay, cool. This is a lot of stuff.

174
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,109
New game. New game.

175
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,769
Oh, Jesus. Okay. So now what? Do I

176
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:09,220
run on streamer mode? No, not yet. I need to even find out like how to equip items and shit.

177
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:22,660
All right. I'm gonna start to try really hard as a headshot right off the bat. Good.

178
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,269
So the whole point of the game is to go down.

179
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,589
Something in here. What's that?

180
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:44,220
Can I break this with a bomb? What is this?

181
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:49,329
Okay. Chaotic polymorphine potion.

182
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,539
And I see what it does.

183
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,980
Equip and throw.

184
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,049
Right mouse button. Drink. It's like a Harry Potter thing. All right, let's go.

185
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,430
What are you gonna play? Wolverine.

186
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,789
Yeah, you saw what happened when people did that. When we when I played Ratatouille,

187
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,150
I may as well have just like just

188
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:26,720
not even turned on the stream that day. This thing seems like more powerful this time. Why?

189
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,230
You guys notice that?

190
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:36,559
This thing is like stronger.

191
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,680
Gold nugget. All right. So how do I go? Is there like a place I can go back and spend the money?

192
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,440
The starting wand is randomized. Oh really?

193
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
Oh shit. Energy sphere.

194
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,079
Damage five. Five. Spread point five degrees. Cast delay.

195
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,789
So the wand is just the thing that houses the spell inside of it. The wand is not its own item.

196
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh, yeah, it kind of is, but it isn't. This game is.

197
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,450
All right. What's this? A sword.

198
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,690
Ooh, this is a new- oh wait, this one's got gas in it. What's this one?

199
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:09,740
Okay, this is a

200
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,829
burst of air. Picked up a new magic-

201
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,369
What happened? What happened? What?

202
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,289
Why? Died from acid.

203
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:31,920
It was a trap room.

204
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,339
Can I get down to like the first save point, please?

205
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,470
This is new. Why is this a 15 in it?

206
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,569
Unstable crystal. It explodes when somebody comes nearby and this one's double ice.

207
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Oh shit, that's awesome.

208
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,619
All right. It's giving me better and better starting items. I like it.

209
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,200
The rogue light, Jerma. There's no save point. Yeah, but I could probably go back and spend money.

210
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
What's the gold for in that case?

211
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,500
Let's go down even further.

212
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:26,299
Noita. Come on, bounce.

213
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,849
I don't think this is even a rage game for me. This is more of like a I understand I'll never do this game.

214
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,980
And it like doesn't bother me that much.

215
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,140
Really, that kind of doesn't.

216
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,589
What is this?

217
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:46,480
It's different. Pheromone potion.

218
00:21:46,880 --> 00:22:01,299
Can I just drink it? Cover myself in pheromones? Okay, now what does that mean?

219
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,079
Do hornets like me now?

220
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,630
All right, blow that up. I want to get- I want that new wand.

221
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:34,900
I want that wand in there. Give it to me. Oh fucking come on. I could just- all right, what is this? Fire?

222
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:40,910
Just- oh, the berm's gonna explode, right? Oh, watch out for the room that it blows up. Or what's this thing do?

223
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay, that's awesome. You know, I can only shoot that a few times. Ten times.

224
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:54,579
I'm gonna go right. He's mad at that. No, I'm not. I'm fine.

225
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,579
Fuck. I'm so bad at terraria type shooting. I swear to god. This is why I don't play these games.

226
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,460
Because I- you have to- you have to look at where your character is and the whole other side of the screen.

227
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:19,470
Like if I'm- if I'm right here and I have to look over here, I have no idea what's happening here.

228
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:39,539
Gold despawns. Oh, that sucks. Can you drown? Yep, you sure can.

229
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,269
Get up. Get up. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Up, up, up, up, up. Why does it want me to- what's this for?

230
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:04,589
Can I like blow this up or something? You can eat corpses.

231
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:26,859
Meat. Is that how you heal? Oh shit, I'm just eating dirt on the ground. The hell- is that hurting me?

232
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:37,200
This is meat here, right? The character can also throw up.

233
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:58,430
All right, what is this one? Oh, is this a lamp? It's just a torch. I'll probably need it later. Oh, I have a friend egg.

234
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:14,559
What's the ten- ten percent? Is that ten percent hungry? What's that? Gunpowder. Oh shit. Okay, everyone back up.

235
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,789
Mouth's over it. Your stomach is almost empty. I have to eat.

236
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:29,359
But is that actually food? You have to actually- this hunger in the game and you start dying if you don't eat?

237
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:37,299
No, okay.

238
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:54,859
I'm- why am I in fire? How do I get in the mud? Why did I go in the muddy water?

239
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:58,609
Okay, I'm fine. So, where did my friend go?

240
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,059
Carve myself in uh, in uh, form ones again.

241
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:16,960
Nice.

242
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,410
All right, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out. What's this? A berserkum potion?

243
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:29,410
Okay, berserkum potion. I guess try-

244
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:35,259
Berserk. You can go berserk.

245
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,250
All right, let's eat these people.

246
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,220
I drink the blood on the ground here? Oh, yeah, I can.

247
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:47,599
The bloody clothes protect you from fire. Okay, that's good to know.

248
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,609
If I carve myself in blood, then I can't be burned anymore?

249
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,670
All right, that thing's

250
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,329
big and horrible.

251
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,930
Gold, gold, look at all that gold. There's so much gold. Gold, gold, gold. How do I- uh, what do I- what do I do?

252
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:06,930
Give me that, give me- just go.

253
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,900
All right, I found it, I found it!

254
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:21,220
Pick up a full health. Increase max health by ten.

255
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:27,410
Pick up a spell refresher. All spells refreshed. Ooh, okay, that's what that means.

256
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,650
And then here's the money.

257
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,650
All right, nice. Let's see. What can I do?

258
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:39,710
The fortune cookie? Okay, what can I buy?

259
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,500
Wand. Not enough gold to purchase this. I can purchase this one.

260
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,230
What the fuck is all this?

261
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,609
Okay, it's spread spread.

262
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,730
Firework.

263
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,369
Rock rock. This one is- oh, this one's boring.

264
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:08,539
This one looks kind of cool.

265
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,539
Void is really good if it works.

266
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:17,410
Pick the right one. You can customize wands while here.

267
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:28,609
Really? Purple is boring. Wait, what? Hold on a second.

268
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,130
This is getting- this is getting a little too deep for my brain to understand.

269
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,259
So I can do magic, missile, fire, and energy sphere.

270
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:51,500
What does that do? It can arc and bounce.

271
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,619
Put the orb spell on the second wand.

272
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:59,150
Oh, I get it. Okay, so I got the orb there.

273
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,190
I got fire here.

274
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,349
Should I do- okay, fire.

275
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,190
Test it on the statues. Do I lose mana?

276
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:14,529
No, no, no, don't. Yes, you do.

277
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,130
Mana regen's in its per wand.

278
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,839
It's 10 casts. Put orb on red wand.

279
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,160
Buy the wand to the right. Put the orb in its open slot.

280
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Uh, what do you want to drop?

281
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,039
Okay, um, do I- how about the torch? Who cares about the torch?

282
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,930
Fuck the torch. Well, who needs a torch?

283
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:45,009
Okay, I got this wand.

284
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,009
And now- oops.

285
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:51,869
Wait, what's going on? Oh, that's what's on the ground. Okay, so.

286
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,849
All right, I- there's a lot of info at one second and with no tutorial.

287
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,049
All right, let me think.

288
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,930
So I have- here it is.

289
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,569
A slow orb of void that eats through all obstacles.

290
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,059
So it's a projectile. So, what's this here?

291
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,180
Warning, this wand does not have enough mana for black hole.

292
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,700
Wand has max 63 mana. Casting black hole requires 180 mana.

293
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,700
Um, all right.

294
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,420
Wait, how do I- where is it?

295
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,380
So I need 180- I don't have 63 fucking mana.

296
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,019
How much mana does this wand have?

297
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,819
113. What about this one?

298
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,140
180! All right, here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

299
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,069
This has 180 mana.

300
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:56,750
So now I can- but I can only shoot this three times.

301
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,029
Is that- is that accurate?

302
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:02,049
That's the black hole. It's cool.

303
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:07,170
So I can only shoot this three times, but it's super insanely powerful, right?

304
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:14,099
All right, so only do this for like an oh shit scenario.

305
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,700
So I gotta put this somewhere else.

306
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,930
I- I- how can I- can I move stuff in my hotbar?

307
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,009
I don't want that to be three. I want that to be all the way over here.

308
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:38,299
Oh, okay. So I want this to be my main wand.

309
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,740
Just the shooting. Just shoot.

310
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,900
This is the secondary for the explosive. This is the bomb.

311
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,779
All right, I get it.

312
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:49,500
Don't- okay, do not use the- do not- what's the guy from Beauty and the Beast?

313
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,210
Luminaire? What is his name?

314
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,009
Don't use him, unless it's a very, very impossible-

315
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,369
It's not Beast, what the fuck?

316
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,829
Oh, what's this?

317
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,829
Press E to pick faster projectiles.

318
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:05,390
Press E to pick boomerang spells.

319
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,190
Press E to pick toxic sludge immunity.

320
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,349
Oh, we're freaking that shit.

321
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,470
I no longer take damage from fucking poison.

322
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,349
Thank god.

323
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:24,299
All right, what is this?

324
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,190
None of gold to purchase perk- oh, you can reroll them.

325
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,059
This is pretty cool, actually.

326
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:36,289
Does this do 10, 20 damage for a headshot?

327
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,210
Or is it just random?

328
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:43,279
Black hole does not do damage.

329
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,720
Well, I can black hole people, and then-

330
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,980
That's- all right, I can't-

331
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:51,180
Whoops.

332
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,779
Give me that, that's a jewel!

333
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:53,180
I got it.

334
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,660
Into the coal pits.

335
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,299
Do these things hurt?

336
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,009
I'm just licking the wood.

337
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:03,890
All right, that's not gonna work.

338
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,200
A jewel.

339
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:09,490
Jewels.

340
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,220
All right, easy.

341
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,759
I'm not gonna black hole down there.

342
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,900
I am gonna utilize the crystallized bomb.

343
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:22,980
Yeah, okay.

344
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,029
What is this stuff classified as?

345
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:28,670
This pink stuff.

346
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,109
What is the pink stuff?

347
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,509
Slimy clothes protect you from fire.

348
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:33,309
So it's just slime.

349
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:34,029
I guess get a bomb.

350
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:43,730
Thank you.

351
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,130
Wait, I can be completely protected from fire?

352
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:49,890
What if I eat the slime?

353
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,930
Whoa, don't eat the slime!

354
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,849
You're spilling sick, nothing stays inside.

355
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:53,250
You pu-

356
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,420
Okay, what does that do for me?

357
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,619
Does it- is there a debuff?

358
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:02,930
That's disgusting.

359
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:05,660
So you don't just get a bottle of water.

360
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,859
I'm protected by fire, though.

361
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:07,660
I'm protected by fire.

362
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,579
Go, go, go, quick, quick, quick.

363
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:10,619
While- while it's still on.

364
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,059
Ow.

365
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,010
All right, we're good.

366
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:30,239
Slime makes you slow, though.

367
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,360
What is this?

368
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,760
Bloody clothes protects you from-

369
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,920
Okay, so blood and slime protects you from fire.

370
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,719
And you can eat blood.

371
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,789
You can also eat gunpowder if you feel like it.

372
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,230
But it would be a very bad idea.

373
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:45,260
Gold vein.

374
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,659
What's that?

375
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,219
How do I get that?

376
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:51,389
Oh, shit.

377
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:51,949
Did I get it?

378
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,699
Did I get it?

379
00:34:59,139 --> 00:34:59,460
Nice.

380
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,019
Okay, cool.

381
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,190
This game's pretty fun.

382
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,449
You know what?

383
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:05,409
Okay, this is-

384
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,170
This is all the parts of Terraria

385
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,780
that are cool without the cra-

386
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,619
This is just non-crafting Terraria.

387
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,909
I don't have to, like, open up a Wikipedia page

388
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,429
with 5,000 articles on it.

389
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,429
I just get cool item and just use.

390
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:28,769
I don't get hit.

391
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,050
That thing-

392
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,329
That's a mega wand down there.

393
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,050
What is that thing?

394
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:37,820
Hey.

395
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,539
Whoa, he's taking-

396
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,179
Wait, you can hit-

397
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:39,739
Wait, what?

398
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,059
They can pick up the items?

399
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,260
He stole that.

400
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,780
He just stole it from me.

401
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,300
That thing was insane.

402
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,940
Where did he go?

403
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,179
No.

404
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:49,500
What?

405
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:53,260
Where did he go?

406
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,340
He just sniped that.

407
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,780
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

408
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,179
Really?

409
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,300
They can take the items?

410
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,460
I gotta go find this motherfucker.

411
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,340
Give me that!

412
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,139
Oh, he-

413
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:03,019
Okay, I think he died.

414
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,809
Wait, I don't want to touch that, though.

415
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:10,539
It's poison right there.

416
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,139
Holy shit.

417
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:14,860
What is this thing?

418
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:18,750
Always casts-

419
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,309
Okay.

420
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:20,110
It's a ga-

421
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,989
A gas tank.

422
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,030
That's like just a gas-

423
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,389
That's a gas station.

424
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,539
Always casts double spread.

425
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:27,739
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

426
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,269
That motherfucker stole a wand again.

427
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:32,510
Okay.

428
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,789
What do I just-

429
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:34,030
I'm-

430
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,429
What do I-

431
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,309
I don't know what it does.

432
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,369
Spitter bolt with timer.

433
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,050
A short-lived magical bolt that casts another spell after a timer runs out.

434
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,579
Is that cooler than this?

435
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:53,440
How much mana does it cost?

436
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:06,460
Okay, this is pretty sick.

437
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:13,679
The firework gun.

438
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,860
Can only fire it once a second, though.

439
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,889
It's still pretty good.

440
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,409
It's got big damage, too, doesn't it?

441
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,690
All right, yeah, let's go.

442
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,610
Hold on.

443
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,250
Wait, not yet.

444
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,809
What's over here?

445
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:34,909
Nothing.

446
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:35,789
Any more gold?

447
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,789
All right, well, I don't have any money.

448
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,070
I only have 93 bucks?

449
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:41,420
I got tons of damage now.

450
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,960
Okay, I don't-

451
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,519
I don't know.

452
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,320
That was weird.

453
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,800
Let's go.

454
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,809
I'm starting to understand how this works.

455
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,260
Pass delay.

456
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,039
Is that thing alive down there?

457
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:08,619
Black hole on this one.

458
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,420
Hold on.

459
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,460
My brain cannot function that quickly.

460
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,949
I need at least one to two hours of failing

461
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:18,190
before I figure out the basic function of the video game.

462
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,289
Ooh, slime.

463
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,469
All right, so remember, from the slime fork,

464
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:31,550
I got to go left and down to get to the end.

465
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:37,119
Important to know.

466
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:37,760
Well, watch it.

467
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,880
Nobody just threw that at me.

468
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,519
All right, I'm going up.

469
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,429
Did the little mouse do that?

470
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:54,750
What is this?

471
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,190
Oh, right.

472
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,309
I forgot about that.

473
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,630
I can't get hurt by poison now.

474
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,340
Well, I'm not even gonna-

475
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm not gonna need another item ever.

476
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,780
This thing is insanely good.

477
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,260
Treasure chest right here.

478
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,199
All right, open up the treasure chest.

479
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
Okay, if I hit-

480
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Should I shoot it?

481
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,590
How do I open it?

482
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,599
Oh my god.

483
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,239
That's a lot of money.

484
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,380
Okay, good.

485
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,900
All right, I opened up the-

486
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,980
That's a pretty fat treasure chest right there.

487
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,780
Coated.

488
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,150
Get it all over me.

489
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,010
No, give me.

490
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,690
Sorry.

491
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,969
This wand is massive.

492
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,630
How much is there to explore?

493
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,670
This is kind of insane.

494
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,559
Can I kick this?

495
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,079
Okay, can I kick this down?

496
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,360
Is this gonna explode on me if I kick this?

497
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,230
It's infinite?

498
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:18,539
Activate streamer mode.

499
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:19,659
No, no, not yet.

500
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:25,579
Ooh, we got two things over here.

501
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:25,980
What's this?

502
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,050
Oh, can I-

503
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,449
I'm gonna have to blow this up.

504
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:42,179
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire.

505
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:42,980
Get the poison to-

506
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,739
Okay, I can stand the poison.

507
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,039
Get the fuck away from me.

508
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:55,599
Stop, please.

509
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,440
Oh my god, don't die here.

510
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:04,610
What the fuck?

511
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,090
Please.

512
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,730
No, don't drink the poison.

513
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,849
Okay, I'm fine.

514
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:09,739
I'm gonna relax.

515
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,659
Fire bats are hell.

516
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,559
I'm trying to get this thing-

517
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,599
All right, what is this?

518
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,119
Concentrated mana.

519
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,619
What's the other one?

520
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:25,070
Jump, aim up, and kick.

521
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,869
Oh, okay, cool.

522
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:31,309
What the hell was that?

523
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:32,909
What did I do?

524
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:33,389
What is that?

525
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:33,949
What potion-

526
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,989
Just get in here and drink it.

527
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:39,940
Worm.

528
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:43,809
You feel like your future worm food.

529
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,570
Ingesting worm pheromones.

530
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,130
What does that mean?

531
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:47,010
Okay.

532
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:57,250
First of all, speaking of pheromones, let's get coated.

533
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,320
And let's get coated in the berserk potion too.

534
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,400
Now I'm fucking angry.

535
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,519
What does this mean?

536
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,329
A berserk curse affects you.

537
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,050
All right, what does it do?

538
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:09,679
And then what's this one?

539
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,639
Concentrated mana.

540
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,420
You gain mana back faster.

541
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,219
Oh, that's pretty cool.

542
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:16,940
Give me that whole thing.

543
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,980
I'm wasting it?

544
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,940
I don't know how that works.

545
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,820
Just drink it from the ground?

546
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,869
Okay, let's go.

547
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,659
I have enough money to leave.

548
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:44,940
Yeah, let's go.

549
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:50,909
Refill the health.

550
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:51,469
Refill the-

551
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,570
It's a stain.

552
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,929
It wears off after a few seconds.

553
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:55,889
Drink it instead.

554
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:56,530
Oh, okay.

555
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm just staining my clothes.

556
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,760
Right click a potion just to drink it.

557
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,000
Okay.

558
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,099
Try black hole before refilling wand.

559
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:08,659
Oh, I didn't.

560
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,300
Sorry.

561
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,940
All right, what do we got?

562
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,139
This is too much.

563
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,260
It's too much for me to think about.

564
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,300
Okay, this is a lot of-

565
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,260
I don't know what any of this is.

566
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,219
All right, let me ask you a question.

567
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,519
What am I looking for out of all these things?

568
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,739
Is it like-

569
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:29,920
What am I looking for?

570
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,440
What are the numbers that I should be looking at here?

571
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,150
Check the perks.

572
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,039
Oh, I see what you mean.

573
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,199
Check and see if I can make these better.

574
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,340
Okay, this is wand experimenter.

575
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,460
I don't know what that does.

576
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,860
Extra knockback on spells and teleportitis dodge.

577
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:02,659
Teleport a short distance away when an enemy projectile is near.

578
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:04,099
I don't know if I want that.

579
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,219
I feel like that kind of sucks.

580
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,340
It's going to teleport me into a fire pit.

581
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,550
All right, let's take a look at these.

582
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,349
This is question mark.

583
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:14,670
Let's-

584
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,829
Okay, this is question mark, question mark, question mark.

585
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,429
Mystery spell.

586
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,139
This is always ca-

587
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:22,940
I don't even know what these are.

588
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,989
Wait, what?

589
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:28,380
Oh my god.

590
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,019
What, what, what?

591
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:29,579
Press E.

592
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:30,619
What's happening?

593
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,940
Those are lightsabers.

594
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,820
Laser, laser, laser.

595
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

596
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,380
I don't understand what's happening.

597
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,340
What's going on?

598
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,920
Press E to read spells.

599
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
No, press E to purchase wand.

600
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,599
Oh, okay, right.

601
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,860
I like this a lot.

602
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,900
I don't want to get rid of this.

603
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,940
This one is-

604
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,219
But this can blow up walls.

605
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:58,050
This one's kind of stupid.

606
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,309
And this one is my black hole.

607
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:02,110
So I'm gonna-

608
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,429
This one-

609
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,550
I don't like this one.

610
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,840
What do these do?

611
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,489
A somewhat peculiar bouncy explosive bolt.

612
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:11,090
25 uses.

613
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,989
Uses 50 mana.

614
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,269
45 damage.

615
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:15,710
That's a lot of damage.

616
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,039
That's a shitload of damage.

617
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:26,340
All right, question for all of you experts.

618
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:35,300
So this wand has one, two, three, four, five, six slots.

619
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,900
Which means that when I click, left click, it uses this one.

620
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,500
Then when I do it again, it uses this one.

621
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,940
When I do it again, it uses this one.

622
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,739
And if there's another thing here, it uses that one on the fourth click.

623
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:48,210
Is that how that works?

624
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,570
If it's shuffle, it's just gonna do a random one in here, right?

625
00:45:51,570 --> 00:46:03,039
Okay, starting to understand.

626
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,579
You really want non-shuffle wands.

627
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:09,539
Starting to figure this out.

628
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,820
Let's see, what's this one?

629
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,659
This one looks interesting.

630
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:16,460
Shuffle no.

631
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,699
So it just goes one, two, three, four, five.

632
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:20,059
One, two, three, four, five.

633
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:22,110
Always.

634
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,789
Max mana set, two, two, ten.

635
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:27,920
Always casts increased mana.

636
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,710
Immediately adds 30 mana to the wand.

637
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,590
Double spell.

638
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,110
Casts two spells.

639
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,380
Gives a projectile a much lower cast delay.

640
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,219
But no respect to your aim.

641
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:43,329
But these aren't moves.

642
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:46,780
Luminous drill with timer.

643
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,099
A pinpointed short-range beam of concentrated light

644
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:51,260
that casts another spell after a timer runs out.

645
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,699
What spell does it cast?

646
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:58,559
It just does this three times.

647
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,480
So I click double spell.

648
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,000
Click heavy, super heavy, and then click timer.

649
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,309
So I have to click three times.

650
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:15,170
So I don't click one, two, three to get here.

651
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,219
You hold the button down.

652
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:20,159
Just click once.

653
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,329
No, you click once and it just goes bananas.

654
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:24,289
Okay, all right.

655
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,590
I'll give it a try.

656
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:45,179
How is this good?

657
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:50,030
This is what it looks like if you accidentally

658
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,630
hit your TV with your Wiimote.

659
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,889
How is this any good?

660
00:47:53,889 --> 00:48:01,139
Remove the spread on it.

661
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:03,460
Heavy spread.

662
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,139
All right, let's take off the heavy spread.

663
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:17,150
All right.

664
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:25,300
It does massive damage.

665
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,159
All right, cool.

666
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,119
All right, this is cool.

667
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,579
All right, now what?

668
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:38,539
So now I've got my standard tried and true fireworks wand.

669
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:41,650
I've got my explosive blow up stuff wand.

670
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:50,849
And I've got, wait, remove double.

671
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:51,250
What?

672
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,039
The two lasers off.

673
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:02,110
It already casts two.

674
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,630
It's already doing double cast.

675
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,440
Oh, it's just using one.

676
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,800
Oh, I see, okay.

677
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,179
So should I put, wait, should I put something else on here?

678
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:16,579
What about like, what about energy sphere?

679
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,099
Oh, look at that.

680
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:27,360
It shoots energy sphere too.

681
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:33,440
That's a lot of mana though.

682
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah, you're right.

683
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,760
It is probably very inefficient.

684
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,559
Very inefficient.

685
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,280
Take it off.

686
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,659
Wait, what about these?

687
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:42,769
What about like the bubble thing?

688
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:43,730
No, no, over here.

689
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:52,059
It's kind of like bubble laser.

690
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,210
It's inefficient though.

691
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,449
Okay, now I understand why everybody loves this game.

692
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:57,920
This is cool.

693
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,949
Less is more, less is more, less is more.

694
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,480
Take off extra lasers.

695
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,820
Did I?

696
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,659
One laser only.

697
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:18,929
Oh wait, but isn't it doing like three times the firepower?

698
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:23,139
It doesn't matter.

699
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:28,429
All right, so let me ask.

700
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:31,730
What's the point of having three of these on?

701
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,369
What would it do?

702
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,780
No, that sucks.

703
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:51,900
Put them all on.

704
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,539
Yeah.

705
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:53,889
What about two?

706
00:50:53,889 --> 00:51:04,960
Okay, this is more consistent.

707
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,639
It's a little less long, but I can fire way more.

708
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,650
That's a pretty good compromise.

709
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,449
Yeah, it is.

710
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:15,579
Put bubble spark, bubble spark, then laser.

711
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:21,409
Is this bubble spark?

712
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:22,690
Bubble spark, where's that?

713
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:31,090
Bubble spark, bubble spark, laser, laser, laser, laser.

714
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:39,360
Okay, that's really cool.

715
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,059
This is awesome.

716
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,739
Okay, but no, inefficient.

717
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:55,019
I'm still, okay, I'm still understanding this.

718
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:57,360
So hold on a second.

719
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,849
This is, my brain is doing all kinds of computations here.

720
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:04,059
So when I click once with shuffle on no,

721
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:06,219
it starts here and does all three in a row.

722
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:08,139
Whatever is in a row here just does them in a row.

723
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:12,639
This is not like click once then for this one cast,

724
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,159
click once then this one cast.

725
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,320
Like in a succession, I just click once

726
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,769
and it just plays out like, just plays out the song, right?

727
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:26,849
If it's shuffle, then it does it in a random direction.

728
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,449
So like, let's say it shuffles on.

729
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:31,010
It could, I click once and it goes like this way, that way,

730
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,769
that way, that way, and that way to end the spell.

731
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:41,329
Don't break the temple.

732
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:43,170
I'm mixing it up.

733
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:49,920
All right, well, let me just use this now.

734
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,719
I'll get it eventually.

735
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,050
Pretty good compromise.

736
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,650
All right, I got 120 bucks.

737
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:02,940
Goes through all of them because there are a timer.

738
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,159
Let's see.

739
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,539
Timer and trigger spells can cast other spells.

740
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:11,420
This is a lot of info, but it's like, look, you know what?

741
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,539
I'm not even going to like,

742
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:14,139
I'll just get you guys help from time to time

743
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,099
because I, you know, it's, I have no idea what the fuck's going on.

744
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:17,739
I'll be honest with you.

745
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,099
I might kind of get it.

746
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:32,179
Not a big fan of that range.

747
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:34,260
Not a big fan of the range.

748
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,150
Okay, now this is another one.

749
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,190
What the fuck is this?

750
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:42,750
Spells cast one, cast delay three, max mana capacity.

751
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,869
What is this one?

752
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:49,869
So this is double, double light bomb.

753
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:55,380
It's trash and explosive one.

754
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,679
It's just more bomb.

755
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,280
Should I replace it with this one?

756
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:10,590
So it's just double, double bomb.

757
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:16,579
Yeah, that's, nah, nah.

758
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:22,579
I got to change this up a little too.

759
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,030
Move this.

760
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:25,489
That's better.

761
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:27,409
So I can really easily switch between the two of them.

762
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,780
Dude, this is like fucking me up, man.

763
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,420
This teleporting, I don't know if I like very much.

764
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:54,480
I'm taking way too many.

765
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,309
Wait, are these saving his ass?

766
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:03,150
Yeah, but it's like teleporting me in random directions

767
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:03,789
that I don't want to be in.

768
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:11,059
I can't take the spells chat.

769
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,340
No, you can't.

770
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,940
Yeah, I guess you can't like rip it apart.

771
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:20,699
I'll be honest with you guys.

772
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,019
I'm not sure I like this very much.

773
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:26,579
It doesn't do enough damage to compensate for the fact

774
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:27,539
that you got to get pretty close.

775
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:29,940
I'm not sure I like it.

776
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,829
You can take the spells to the next mountain.

777
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,760
Fuck, I got hurt.

778
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:49,440
I don't like those guys.

779
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,320
I hate those guys.

780
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,119
They're so accurate.

781
00:55:51,679 --> 00:56:04,159
You can dig with the laser.

782
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,659
And this is different.

783
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,460
Okay, what's this one?

784
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:14,420
Electric charge.

785
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,780
It gives a projectile electric charge.

786
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,619
It's splitter bolt.

787
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,059
So it's an electric electricity that explodes.

788
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,880
All right, let's try it.

789
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,929
Holy shit, okay.

790
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,409
No, give me that.

791
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:33,889
Don't take that.

792
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:34,369
It's mine.

793
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:36,769
Use it.

794
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:37,889
Pepe laugh.

795
00:56:37,889 --> 00:56:43,820
I actually kind of like it.

796
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,699
It's pretty good.

797
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:52,719
Yeah, I like it.

798
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,280
Does it do how much damage does it do?

799
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:04,719
Plus three damage electric, eight.

800
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,599
So like, you know, 15, 20, 30.

801
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,699
I think I'm going to leave this.

802
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:14,420
I don't think I want that anymore.

803
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:21,420
Yeah, that's sad though.

804
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,329
Dig.

805
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:26,050
I'm digging.

806
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,809
Look, there's water down here.

807
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:44,699
Who would have thought?

808
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:45,900
It's a snow level.

809
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:52,190
Yeah, I'm a big fan of this.

810
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:52,989
It's a lot of...

811
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,349
It's spammable.

812
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:55,389
It's very damageable.

813
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,429
It's very cool.

814
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:57,789
I'm into it.

815
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:01,469
Oh, this is great.

816
00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:02,269
This is really great.

817
00:58:02,269 --> 00:58:03,389
Actually, this is very great.

818
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:07,329
Let him burn.

819
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:08,900
Let him burn.

820
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,480
The bubble sparks.

821
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,710
This thing's a lot of health.

822
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,349
All right, you know what?

823
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:24,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

824
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,869
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

825
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,630
He's so good at aiming.

826
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:40,429
I'm stuck in the wall.

827
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,829
Help.

828
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:44,369
Am I drowning?

829
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:46,480
I'm not drowning, am I?

830
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,309
Get me out of here.

831
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:53,389
Get me out of here.

832
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:54,190
He's going to kill me.

833
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,139
I don't have very much health.

834
00:58:58,139 --> 00:58:58,380
I got to...

835
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,239
Fuck.

836
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:02,880
That hurt.

837
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,460
That hurt.

838
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,860
That hurt.

839
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,260
That hurt.

840
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,539
Do I have any healing potions?

841
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:10,159
I thought you said right-click drinks.

842
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:16,739
You guys told me right-click drink, didn't you?

843
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,550
You have to do it in the inventory.

844
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,110
Okay, so it is fucking terraria, isn't it?

845
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,940
Snowman.

846
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,469
Is that an enemy?

847
00:59:27,469 --> 00:59:31,570
It looks like an enemy.

848
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,050
It could be.

849
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:38,599
Jesus.

850
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:44,849
Okay, in the inventory.

851
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:46,289
Berserk potion.

852
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:47,650
Right-click.

853
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,460
Berserk.

854
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,019
12 seconds.

855
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,239
Okay, I'm berserk right now.

856
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:53,489
What does that mean?

857
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:03,889
Get him.

858
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:05,039
These guys suck.

859
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,260
It's bigger explosions.

860
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,579
Ooh.

861
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:16,380
Watch it.

862
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:19,260
All right, I'm going to drop a fucking bomb down there.

863
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:26,590
All right, eat this stuff.

864
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,389
This is meat, right?

865
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:28,510
No, this is blood.

866
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,070
Rotten meat.

867
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,550
Don't eat that.

868
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:32,940
Jesus.

869
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,690
Dude, how are you supposed to dodge that shit?

870
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:37,329
They fire so...

871
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:45,860
Berserk mode.

872
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,179
Let's go.

873
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:57,170
Whoa.

874
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:03,380
Oh, it really is saving my ass so much.

875
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:06,420
I complained about it because it's hard to see what I'm doing,

876
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,260
but it really is saving me.

877
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,219
That's fire and I'm dead.

878
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,500
That's fire and I'm dead.

879
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,099
Am I alive?

880
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:18,880
Potion?

881
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,019
Did that work?

882
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:31,900
Use the black hole.

883
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:33,739
I don't need to get...

884
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,260
Potion will put out a fire.

885
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:37,500
Okay.

886
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,219
Watch out for that shit.

887
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:45,860
Potion.

888
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,820
Wait, get the money first.

889
01:01:48,429 --> 01:01:49,070
Ooh.

890
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,230
Should I risk it or should I just go?

891
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:52,909
I only have $193.

892
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,500
Wait, what's this?

893
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:01,599
It's invisibility.

894
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,800
Oh, good thing I didn't go right in that portal.

895
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,559
Because look at what this is.

896
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,400
Uh, good thing I didn't go in.

897
01:02:13,949 --> 01:02:14,829
Double scatter.

898
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:17,570
Double double scatter.

899
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,210
Gunpowder.

900
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,860
And then glowing lance.

901
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:27,179
Let's give it a try.

902
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,550
Okay, this is dangerous.

903
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,059
That's dangerous.

904
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,260
This is dangerous.

905
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,219
But it's pretty good.

906
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:49,469
Fires.

907
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:50,699
Okay.

908
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,710
Yeah, fuck that thing.

909
01:02:54,909 --> 01:03:07,949
You can take the gunpowder.

910
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:08,829
Wait, what?

911
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:11,710
Oh, thank god you heal every time.

912
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:14,219
Leave, you dumb fuck.

913
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,539
I did.

914
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:17,260
I'm leaving.

915
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:22,139
Spell layout's not good on this.

916
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:26,449
Not.

917
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,969
Alright, so hold on.

918
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:30,659
So what, should I do this instead?

919
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:37,920
Ban that guy.

920
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,719
It says amazing stats.

921
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,980
Alright, wait a minute.

922
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,420
Okay, now I can buy spells but I don't have enough money.

923
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,409
I don't have enough to buy this.

924
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:54,210
Electric arc.

925
01:03:54,929 --> 01:04:00,260
Stop hoarding the black hole, you cuck.

926
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:08,320
Buy this.

927
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,989
Alright, so let's make a cool spell.

928
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,750
Alright, so I have electrical arc.

929
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,539
I'm gonna do electrical arc and then all this.

930
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:18,099
What just happened?

931
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:18,980
Where'd that go?

932
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,099
Where'd that spell go?

933
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:28,000
How does that look?

934
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,559
Let's try it.

935
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:42,860
Dude, this is too much.

936
01:04:42,860 --> 01:05:04,659
Remove the gunpowder with the lightning in the front.

937
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:13,840
Remove one of the lances.

938
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:25,409
This is pretty sick, actually.

939
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,400
Take another lance off.

940
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,599
Let's see.

941
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:40,989
Yeah, three's better.

942
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:48,900
Can I make my...

943
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:50,579
This is my favorite wand.

944
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:51,460
Can I make this any better?

945
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:54,500
Wait, what if I do electrical arcing here?

946
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,920
Take this shit out.

947
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:11,550
It's okay.

948
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:17,619
It looked cool for a minute.

949
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:19,699
Needs two projectiles.

950
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:20,820
Oh, right.

951
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,619
Okay, I see.

952
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:26,750
So the goal here is to try to get things in the middle of this, right?

953
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,699
So if I hit something right in the middle inside that wedge,

954
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:37,150
I'm putting a laser on the green wand.

955
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:42,559
What do you mean, a laser?

956
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,250
Dude, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

957
01:06:53,250 --> 01:07:10,349
What happens if I do this?

958
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:11,550
No, not very good.

959
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:24,239
That's better.

960
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:29,489
Laser is the green thing.

961
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:30,530
Oh, okay, hold on.

962
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,570
Wait, let's try this one.

963
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,300
Oh, yeah.

964
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:37,739
That's...

965
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:38,860
I'm leaving it there.

966
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:41,489
What happened?

967
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:45,920
Why can I not fire this anymore?

968
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,980
Oh, I have no mana.

969
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:52,639
How do I get mana to go fast?

970
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:56,699
That's so slow.

971
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:58,579
Oh, that's too bad.

972
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:20,050
What about this?

973
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,539
Only laser on it.

974
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:23,579
Use double spell.

975
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:24,619
No, I can't.

976
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,350
Drink the green potion.

977
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,069
No, I can't.

978
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,100
I can't do it.

979
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:28,979
Mana charge speed.

980
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:29,380
I can't do it.

981
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,420
It's too much for my brain right now.

982
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,619
It's a lot of info.

983
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:32,180
I can't.

984
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,939
I like what I have right now.

985
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:36,270
This is perfect.

986
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:36,909
Yes, you can.

987
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:37,470
I can't do it.

988
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:38,029
I can't.

989
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:38,899
I can't do it.

990
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:39,939
I just can't.

991
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:40,420
It's too much.

992
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:40,979
I like this.

993
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:41,699
I'm going to keep it.

994
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:46,859
Put laser on one and two.

995
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:52,430
What do you mean one and two?

996
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,079
Stop saying no.

997
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,579
Use it as artillery.

998
01:08:57,579 --> 01:08:58,430
It's okay.

999
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,829
Put mana in the water.

1000
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:02,510
Don't shoot electricity in the water.

1001
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,510
I like what I got right now.

1002
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:06,930
Actually, this thing sucks.

1003
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:08,449
I don't want this anymore.

1004
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:09,810
I want to make this better.

1005
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:22,510
It's good for digging.

1006
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,630
Yeah, you know what it is.

1007
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,029
You're right.

1008
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,260
This is going to be the dig weapon.

1009
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:31,970
Yeah, this is dig.

1010
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,890
Two lasers to dig.

1011
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,069
I like it.

1012
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:37,869
I'm ready.

1013
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:39,119
I'm good.

1014
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,590
This is my attack wand.

1015
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:45,220
And I have black hole for when I need to have an insane moment.

1016
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,340
All right, let's go.

1017
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,970
He's too indecisive.

1018
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:53,409
I think it's less indecisive and more.

1019
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:56,289
I still sort of have no idea what's going on.

1020
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,180
Gold is forever.

1021
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,460
More blood and gas fire.

1022
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,310
Gold is forever.

1023
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:09,869
What does that mean?

1024
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,180
I get to keep the gold through runs?

1025
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,079
Gold nuggets never disappear.

1026
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:20,239
Oh, well, that's not what I wanted.

1027
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:31,520
This does so much damage.

1028
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,319
We can hit it.

1029
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:45,420
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

1030
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,140
What happened?

1031
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:50,079
I thought that was a training dummy.

1032
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,600
That was not a training dummy.

1033
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,560
I thought that was a training dummy.

1034
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,399
What do you mean I angered the gods?

1035
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,539
I thought that was like a, hey, test out your new stuff.

1036
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:00,539
That's not what that is.

1037
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:07,090
You trained too hard.

1038
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,000
That hurt a lot.

1039
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,479
He just point blanks at me with a fucking grenade launcher.

1040
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,140
Snipe him from back here through the dirt.

1041
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,699
I beheaded the statue.

1042
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:25,300
I didn't know that was going to happen.

1043
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,460
I thought it was just a training dummy.

1044
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:34,909
All right, get me in here.

1045
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:41,710
Whoa, all right, easy.

1046
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,619
Should I be eating people though?

1047
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:45,500
Should I eat people?

1048
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,800
Your stomach is almost, but what does that mean?

1049
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,359
What, what happened?

1050
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:53,039
What does eating people do?

1051
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,000
What is this percentage thing?

1052
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,960
What does it mean?

1053
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,930
It doesn't do anything.

1054
01:11:58,930 --> 01:11:59,810
It does nothing.

1055
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,770
Okay, so why am I doing it?

1056
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:09,970
Cannibalism is wrong.

1057
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:10,850
It's not cannibalism.

1058
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:14,640
These, I'm, wait, what do you mean cannibalism?

1059
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,079
Oh boy, this is where it gets a little, black hole, black hole, black hole, black hole.

1060
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,739
It didn't, black hole didn't do anything.

1061
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:28,579
What the fuck?

1062
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:29,079
What?

1063
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:31,890
Oh my God.

1064
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:34,609
Voice crack, worst one I've probably done in a long time.

1065
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:38,050
I'm dead.

1066
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:39,010
Goodbye.

1067
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:47,229
That was, I just got spawned on by like 40 people.

1068
01:12:54,109 --> 01:12:55,789
Black hole is for digging.

1069
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:56,909
Why are they fighting each other?

1070
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:05,810
Oh my God, look at all this progress.

1071
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:15,939
Streamer mode, not yet.

1072
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:22,479
Give me like another one or two runs.

1073
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:23,439
Starting to figure this out.

1074
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:24,079
All right, let's move.

1075
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:25,680
I'm going to go quick and I'm going to go very fast.

1076
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,399
I'm going to do this well.

1077
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:28,239
What do I got for wands?

1078
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,279
I got spark bolt and bomb.

1079
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:31,779
Let's go.

1080
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:34,979
I'm not being integrated.

1081
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:36,659
No, not yet.

1082
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:39,149
I like this.

1083
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:39,710
I'm having fun.

1084
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:42,029
I don't want this whole thing just getting to be memed.

1085
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:45,069
And I want to, I want to play non-meme.

1086
01:13:45,069 --> 01:13:46,430
I like this game.

1087
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:58,939
Oh, we got a new wand.

1088
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:05,489
What do we got?

1089
01:14:05,489 --> 01:14:06,979
I'll take it.

1090
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:07,939
Whatever it is, let's go.

1091
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,970
Ooh, it's a double shot.

1092
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,010
This game is shit.

1093
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:14,210
Install my mod.

1094
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:21,460
Well, do you think this game sucks, but you loved it enough to make a mod for it?

1095
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:34,939
What are you talking about?

1096
01:14:34,939 --> 01:14:36,060
And things can crit.

1097
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:39,920
Oh, okay.

1098
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,039
Why is the water on fire?

1099
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,880
You light the mud on fire.

1100
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,689
What are you protected by?

1101
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:55,619
Oh, we got a bunch of jumps in here that about to get bombed from above.

1102
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:07,710
Oh, right.

1103
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,590
You can't hover forever.

1104
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:09,090
Okay.

1105
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:18,289
Fall joke.

1106
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:19,569
Thank God there's no fall damage.

1107
01:15:19,569 --> 01:15:20,289
That would have been sad.

1108
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,979
It's got double tapped.

1109
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:26,060
Like I hit his head on the ceiling and died.

1110
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:28,050
What an embarrassment.

1111
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,810
I can't believe I let that guy kill me.

1112
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,680
Hurt me, you know, whatever.

1113
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,199
This is fun.

1114
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,770
Bouncing Burst.

1115
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:43,180
All right.

1116
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,460
I'm willing to try everything.

1117
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,699
I think I found the one I want to use.

1118
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,100
I'm pretty sure I found the one I like.

1119
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:56,609
This is awesome.

1120
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:01,649
What just exploded?

1121
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:07,729
Tabula Smaragdina.

1122
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,289
What is that?

1123
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,770
Pick up Tabula Smaragdina.

1124
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:13,510
Okay.

1125
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,819
Can somebody take out the NES cartridge and blow in it?

1126
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:22,100
Oh, wait, I can read it now.

1127
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,199
If all the mountains were of silver and gold,

1128
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,039
what would they profit?

1129
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,090
If all the mountains were of silver and gold,

1130
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:43,970
what would they profit?

1131
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,970
A man who lives in a constant fear of death.

1132
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:49,649
Hence, there cannot be in the whole world anything better than our medicine,

1133
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:52,050
which has the power to heal all the diseases of the flesh.

1134
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:54,819
Can I eat it?

1135
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:06,430
Swamp potion.

1136
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,149
Whip and throw.

1137
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:08,430
Swamp potion.

1138
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:13,500
Food poisoning.

1139
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:24,000
Whoa, what's that?

1140
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:45,659
How much more?

1141
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,579
Did I just screw myself?

1142
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:56,180
Keep going.

1143
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,979
I don't have enough potion to keep going.

1144
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:09,500
I made it.

1145
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,180
Okay, what the hell is over here?

1146
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,020
It's got to be like a treasure chest over here.

1147
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:17,090
It has to be.

1148
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,010
Guaranteed treasure chest down here.

1149
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:30,109
Uh, okay.

1150
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,140
Entered the orb room.

1151
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:45,460
Oh, there's a magical sacred orb over here and another scroll of poison.

1152
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:52,289
Okay, I picked up the other tablet.

1153
01:18:52,289 --> 01:19:00,109
Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals.

1154
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:04,350
However, there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment.

1155
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:07,069
The person who studies this art must have either everything or nothing.

1156
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,029
An alchemist who knows only half of their crap

1157
01:19:10,029 --> 01:19:13,069
reaps nothing but disappointment and waste of time and money.

1158
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:17,310
Moreover, they lay themselves upon to the mockery of those who despise our art.

1159
01:19:18,189 --> 01:19:22,029
Those indeed who succeed in research reaching the-

1160
01:19:23,229 --> 01:19:23,710
Hold on.

1161
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:25,949
I'm like drunk reading.

1162
01:19:25,949 --> 01:19:26,350
This is what-

1163
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,670
Okay, when you get like a drunk text and you're drunk,

1164
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:29,710
it's like, what did you just say?

1165
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,319
Hey, where are you?

1166
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:34,079
Why are you not in the hotel room?

1167
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:35,279
I don't know.

1168
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,670
Thus, those indeed who succeed in reaching the goal of the magistrate

1169
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:43,149
have not only infinite riches but the means of continued light.

1170
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:46,029
Am I- Did I just go down like the lore path?

1171
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,869
Where you collect like four of these and it turns into a fucking demon?

1172
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:54,850
First, eat pick up orb.

1173
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:59,920
We discovered an orb of true knowledge.

1174
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:08,050
Picked up thundercloud five.

1175
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:14,369
Creates a stormy cloud.

1176
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:21,039
Holy, that's- that seems pretty good.

1177
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:22,640
That's a new- I unlocked a new spell?

1178
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:27,600
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1179
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,319
All right, let's go.

1180
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,840
Fill your water bottle.

1181
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:35,380
Can you do that?

1182
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,739
Oh, you can.

1183
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:44,800
I swear to fucking god, I have no idea what's wrong with-

1184
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,920
I didn't mean to do that.

1185
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,079
Kill!

1186
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,439
Kill!

1187
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:59,119
You took my orb, right?

1188
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,109
Okay, that was fun.

1189
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:11,279
Is it like the last boss or something?

1190
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:15,649
This is like one of the last-

1191
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:16,529
It's probably the last boss.

1192
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:22,159
Hold on a second.

1193
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,039
I unlocked a new spell.

1194
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,859
Where is it?

1195
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:29,220
Where is it?

1196
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:29,859
I unlocked it.

1197
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,979
Where is it?

1198
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:41,119
It's the last boss's room, son.

1199
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:44,560
I have to sc-

1200
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,520
There's more, okay?

1201
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,319
It's still not here.

1202
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:50,590
It was like storm cloud, right?

1203
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:56,930
You have to use it to make it show up.

1204
01:21:57,729 --> 01:22:01,520
All right, let's go.

1205
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:01,920
Come on.

1206
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,739
Didn't cast it.

1207
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:06,300
Oh.

1208
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,500
Does that mean I didn't unlock it though?

1209
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,859
Or does it still unlock?

1210
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:10,220
I don't have to do all that bullshit again, do I?

1211
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:13,170
Integrate as-

1212
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:13,329
No!

1213
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,789
All right, I have a question for those that want me to do Twitch integration.

1214
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,909
Um, you want-

1215
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:22,510
Can I just type in my channel name

1216
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,350
or do I have to like go through a major process

1217
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,310
and like install a bunch of shit?

1218
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:26,350
Or can I just type my name in?

1219
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:31,649
Go left, hold on.

1220
01:22:31,649 --> 01:22:32,449
Just channel name.

1221
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:33,489
Just type your name, okay.

1222
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:43,119
You have to post dick pics.

1223
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:56,460
That's like-

1224
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,100
That's of the same level of-

1225
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:04,670
Like they give me 5 BTC and I send you 10 BTC scam.

1226
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:09,819
In fact, that may even be worse.

1227
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,970
What's the point of going over here?

1228
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:23,039
Throw a bomb in here.

1229
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,020
Now what?

1230
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:33,939
It's just water.

1231
01:23:33,939 --> 01:23:38,689
Give me some air, give me some air.

1232
01:23:38,689 --> 01:23:51,729
Oh shit, another scroll!

1233
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:54,000
Oh no!

1234
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,479
I can't wait to summon that monster again.

1235
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,750
Sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge

1236
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,670
is the highest level of-

1237
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:05,069
There's a mutant in here.

1238
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:25,489
I'll kill him.

1239
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,250
This is the final boss.

1240
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,289
That would be pretty disappointing.

1241
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,670
This is just Terraria.

1242
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,149
Yes, it is.

1243
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,260
But it's more custom-

1244
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:34,760
Okay.

1245
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,579
Do you guys remember the game Magica?

1246
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:43,979
This is Magica and Terraria together.

1247
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:48,930
And remember they made another Magica?

1248
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,890
They had this awesome, incredibly fun video game

1249
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:54,609
where you combine spells and could play with your friends.

1250
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,250
And then they made another Magica.

1251
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,890
And then I died apparently because I ran out of oxygen.

1252
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:02,210
That didn't happen-

1253
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,529
Look, that didn't happen like that in that order.

1254
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,289
But I remember that too.

1255
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,899
Point is, they took that franchise and threw it in the trash.

1256
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:19,250
If they had just expanded on Magica 1

1257
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,130
instead of making like a multiplayer fighter game,

1258
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:26,899
that could have been such a great franchise.

1259
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:30,369
Oh, I'm not going left again.

1260
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:33,090
Oh, you guys-

1261
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:34,130
You guys want to get integrated?

1262
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,159
Then I'm going to play the way I want to play, okay?

1263
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:39,619
Islands?

1264
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:41,199
Demanded.

1265
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:44,819
You guys want to get twitch integration?

1266
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:51,649
Then I'm going to play the way that I want to play.

1267
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:53,729
Ooh, steel potion.

1268
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:54,210
What is this called?

1269
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:54,930
Stamina potion?

1270
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:57,250
A slime potion.

1271
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:57,810
Cool.

1272
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:58,930
I still don't understand anything.

1273
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:01,630
He's a tyrant.

1274
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,859
Kind of.

1275
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,720
I'm glad it started with the bubble wand.

1276
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,920
I like these the best.

1277
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,619
How many floors are there?

1278
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,779
Because I got to snow floor and then I got overwhelmed.

1279
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,840
How many actual floors are there?

1280
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,640
This game is really fun.

1281
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:28,140
Seven.

1282
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:29,340
What did I get?

1283
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,300
Four? Five?

1284
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,000
Holy shit, this guy is unkillable.

1285
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,840
I got to four, okay.

1286
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,149
Five?

1287
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:43,649
Oh.

1288
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:55,090
I don't know what they said,

1289
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,930
but somebody said I'm willing to be perma-banned to this.

1290
01:26:57,729 --> 01:26:59,489
I guess enjoy your perma-ban, whatever you said.

1291
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:00,529
I don't know what it was.

1292
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:01,489
Have a nice day.

1293
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,119
That's the first thing.

1294
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,199
I don't even know what he said.

1295
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,000
I can't even read it.

1296
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:19,149
It should be about seven floors.

1297
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:24,239
What does it say?

1298
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,039
Okay.

1299
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,640
Jerma, I'm willing to bet a perma-ban on you liking Jedi a canopy

1300
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,479
because it's like Dark Messiah.

1301
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,500
Well, why would I perma-ban you if I don't like a game you suggested?

1302
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,340
Isn't that kind of weird?

1303
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:40,159
I didn't like that game.

1304
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,439
Ban that person forever.

1305
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,279
I dig.

1306
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:51,060
I try to go down to the center?

1307
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,939
Something in the bottom here?

1308
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,590
Okay, well that was...

1309
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:57,550
What happened?

1310
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:02,210
Twitch chat is full of nerds.

1311
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:05,729
I mean, it's true.

1312
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:07,250
Aren't you one of them?

1313
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:07,810
I'm one of them.

1314
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,739
We're all totally nerds here now.

1315
01:28:10,739 --> 01:28:16,979
I'm getting a lot of really hard enemy spawns, don't you think?

1316
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:19,550
It's like, what the fuck was that all about?

1317
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:22,079
I'm like dead.

1318
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,899
I don't have enough money for any...

1319
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:25,859
No, I'm not going in yet.

1320
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:28,289
One more money.

1321
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:31,779
The menu sounds like Taco Bell.

1322
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:44,739
Crunchwrap Supreme.

1323
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:48,100
Only $2.99 with our box combo.

1324
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:48,819
Come to the bell.

1325
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:51,699
You fucking asshole.

1326
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:53,949
That doesn't make you an asshole.

1327
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:54,670
What's wrong with me?

1328
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:57,489
That's so fucking funny.

1329
01:28:57,489 --> 01:28:57,970
Just go.

1330
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:58,529
Oh, I'm going.

1331
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:03,100
Remember, don't shoot his head off.

1332
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:04,930
Please mod me.

1333
01:29:05,489 --> 01:29:08,979
Wait, something's hidden down here.

1334
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:09,619
Is this free?

1335
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:20,699
I can't get that.

1336
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:23,979
There's a fish in here.

1337
01:29:23,979 --> 01:29:24,779
Can I touch the fish?

1338
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,680
Catch the fish?

1339
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:40,529
What does it say?

1340
01:29:40,529 --> 01:29:42,130
Meat of an innocent creature.

1341
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:43,600
Ooh.

1342
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,100
Oops.

1343
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:54,189
Sorry about that.

1344
01:29:59,090 --> 01:29:59,569
I don't know.

1345
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:00,609
I thought it was like a magic fish.

1346
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:01,109
Okay.

1347
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,369
Fireball.

1348
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,510
I kind of want fireball.

1349
01:30:05,069 --> 01:30:06,180
Bouncing burst.

1350
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:07,619
Glitter bomb.

1351
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:08,119
Wait.

1352
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:09,539
Chainsaw.

1353
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:10,100
Glitter bomb.

1354
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,220
Chainsaw.

1355
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,529
I can get both.

1356
01:30:14,529 --> 01:30:15,010
No, I can't.

1357
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,439
Good tool for cutting meat.

1358
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:22,800
Also has some magical properties.

1359
01:30:24,909 --> 01:30:25,869
Chainsaw bubble?

1360
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:38,420
How does it work?

1361
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:54,479
Oh, that's kind of cool.

1362
01:30:59,010 --> 01:30:59,890
Chainsaw on two.

1363
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:00,130
All right.

1364
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:00,850
So what about this one?

1365
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:02,369
Should I get a bouncing burst?

1366
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,939
I might as well.

1367
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:05,260
All right.

1368
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:05,659
Let's see.

1369
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:06,300
Bouncing burst.

1370
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,060
And yeah, let's do this.

1371
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:15,739
That works for me.

1372
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:25,170
Bounce on two.

1373
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,890
Bounce on two.

1374
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,449
Bounce on two.

1375
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:32,670
Yeah, but then I don't have a chainsaw anymore.

1376
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:34,350
Chainsaw on one.

1377
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:35,710
Bounce on two.

1378
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:37,899
Okay.

1379
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:39,420
That's pretty good.

1380
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:45,659
It's so bad on mana recharge though.

1381
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,359
Recharge time.

1382
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:50,640
Mana charge speed six.

1383
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:51,359
That's terrible.

1384
01:31:52,819 --> 01:31:53,619
Six?

1385
01:31:53,619 --> 01:31:55,819
That's bad.

1386
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:57,579
That's bad.

1387
01:31:57,579 --> 01:31:58,539
I'd rather have it like this.

1388
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:03,119
Yeah, this is more consistent.

1389
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,210
This is the chainsaw.

1390
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,649
And I can just dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

1391
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,819
Did I dig down here?

1392
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,010
I can't.

1393
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:17,569
Yeah, I can.

1394
01:32:17,569 --> 01:32:18,050
But whatever.

1395
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:18,289
All right.

1396
01:32:18,289 --> 01:32:18,449
Cool.

1397
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:18,770
Let's go.

1398
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:26,529
Enemy radar.

1399
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,680
Freeze field.

1400
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,960
Wand radar.

1401
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,750
Hey, Jeremy.

1402
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,510
A bit of a long message, but I've been a long time viewer.

1403
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,310
We'll just put a quick question.

1404
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,350
How many people have you killed?

1405
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:42,340
Zero.

1406
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:42,979
Thanks for the...

1407
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:44,579
I really thought I had something there.

1408
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:45,079
Okay.

1409
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:47,939
Wand radar.

1410
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:52,130
Is that...

1411
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:52,289
What?

1412
01:32:52,289 --> 01:32:53,890
Does something show up like a minimap or something?

1413
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:55,949
Freeze field.

1414
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:56,590
I'm gonna do...

1415
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,229
I'm...

1416
01:32:57,229 --> 01:32:57,789
Freeze field.

1417
01:32:57,789 --> 01:33:01,460
Liquids freeze in your presence.

1418
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,220
That kind of feels like it sucks.

1419
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:12,670
All right, let's move.

1420
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:16,369
Did I anger him again?

1421
01:33:16,369 --> 01:33:17,170
I didn't do anything.

1422
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,409
Liquids freeze in your presence.

1423
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,569
Wait.

1424
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:25,090
Does this do this to lava too?

1425
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,050
If it does, that's pretty good.

1426
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:28,460
Omega lol.

1427
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,739
Star Wars cringe post.

1428
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:29,979
Cool.

1429
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,300
Because somebody said they want me to play Star Wars Jedi Academy?

1430
01:33:36,829 --> 01:33:38,829
Star Wars cringe post.

1431
01:33:38,829 --> 01:33:39,550
Oh, dig that out.

1432
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:40,590
That's gold.

1433
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:48,800
Dig that out.

1434
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:58,079
Am I destroying it?

1435
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:04,590
Am I destroying it?

1436
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:06,739
Okay.

1437
01:34:06,739 --> 01:34:06,979
No.

1438
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:07,460
I was going to say.

1439
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:07,939
Why?

1440
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:08,420
It sounds like it's...

1441
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,420
All right.

1442
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,300
I need a much bigger recharge for this wand.

1443
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:19,180
I got to find a recharge rate for the chainsaw.

1444
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:19,739
Come on, dude.

1445
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:20,220
Seriously.

1446
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:21,659
That's just terrible.

1447
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:22,300
This is awful.

1448
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:22,859
Let's be honest.

1449
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:28,720
I'm going to sneak this way, though.

1450
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:36,399
Probably something down here.

1451
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:37,840
Gold over there too.

1452
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,439
Gold everywhere.

1453
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:41,840
Hold on.

1454
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,800
I got to stick around for a minute.

1455
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,520
Hold on.

1456
01:34:43,520 --> 01:35:00,260
Is this worth it?

1457
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,220
How much gold do you get?

1458
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:11,229
You don't get one.

1459
01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:16,380
I feel like I'm doing the thing in worms that everybody hates.

1460
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:20,399
When you just take one of your worms and you just continue to drill down

1461
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:23,439
and just stay safe the whole time.

1462
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:27,470
Oh, is it my turn?

1463
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,329
Okay.

1464
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:33,250
I love playing this game with my friends.

1465
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:36,800
That's worth it.

1466
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,359
That's 100.

1467
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:38,800
That was like 40 gold.

1468
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,520
And then somebody finally gets like right there.

1469
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,359
You're like fucking down here.

1470
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:46,899
They just like throw like a...

1471
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,229
He knows.

1472
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:01,869
Who doesn't know?

1473
01:36:01,869 --> 01:36:04,880
That's like one of the most classic franchises ever.

1474
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,680
I know.

1475
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:18,100
Does it recharge faster if you don't look at it?

1476
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:24,130
There is a holy hand grenade in this.

1477
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:28,399
Are they still making worms games?

1478
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:33,300
I'm starting to get like the urge to play one.

1479
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,539
But not like a new age worms game.

1480
01:36:37,539 --> 01:36:38,420
Like worms.

1481
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:40,699
Like original like worms 2.

1482
01:36:40,699 --> 01:36:44,479
Worms Armageddon.

1483
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:47,119
This is a complete just pulling this out of my ass completely.

1484
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:50,000
But I feel like worms is one of those franchises

1485
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,939
that would potentially be trying to modernize too much.

1486
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:55,859
And the game is not even close to as fun as it was before.

1487
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:56,579
Is that true?

1488
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:01,680
I have no idea.

1489
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,399
I'm making that up.

1490
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:02,800
I don't know.

1491
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,239
But I just feel like it could be.

1492
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:12,460
I don't know.

1493
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:15,300
That game seems very iPad-able.

1494
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,220
Right?

1495
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,859
It does.

1496
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:19,899
Worms Mobile.

1497
01:37:19,899 --> 01:37:23,090
And then that's just all they have.

1498
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:26,479
Look, that's a huge chunk right there.

1499
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:27,680
I have to at least get that one.

1500
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:36,189
Says the guy that plays iPad games.

1501
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:36,750
Yeah.

1502
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:41,409
Now I have, you know, E3.

1503
01:37:41,409 --> 01:37:42,850
I know that people are going to laugh at this.

1504
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:44,050
Maybe I've already told this story.

1505
01:37:44,449 --> 01:37:46,529
E3, like 2013.

1506
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,899
Star and I, we shared a hotel room together.

1507
01:37:52,899 --> 01:37:56,579
And I was in the middle of playing Family Guy.

1508
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:02,640
The Family Guy, the quest for stuff.

1509
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:07,520
And Star was just sitting in the bed over next to me,

1510
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,739
watching me just tap on the iPad and like collecting coins.

1511
01:38:11,739 --> 01:38:15,659
I had a town that was huge.

1512
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:20,109
It was like a rival to the best towns in the whole game.

1513
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:21,149
I had every character.

1514
01:38:21,149 --> 01:38:22,029
I had Quagmire.

1515
01:38:22,029 --> 01:38:22,989
I had Lois.

1516
01:38:22,989 --> 01:38:23,789
I had Stewie.

1517
01:38:23,789 --> 01:38:24,829
I had Peter.

1518
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,390
I had Professor Xavier.

1519
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,350
Whatever the guy's name is.

1520
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:29,310
I had all of them.

1521
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:31,470
And I'm going to be honest with you.

1522
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:34,210
I have to be honest with you because I hope that I am.

1523
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:38,130
I spent at least, and I'm being completely real,

1524
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:39,250
and I hate to say this out loud,

1525
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,449
at least $100 on that game.

1526
01:38:40,449 --> 01:38:41,250
I swear to God.

1527
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,770
At least $100.

1528
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:44,130
It probably was like $200.

1529
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:49,020
Over the course of like five months of me caring about it.

1530
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,659
I don't know why.

1531
01:38:49,659 --> 01:38:50,300
I didn't even care.

1532
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:54,819
I spent at least $100 on that game.

1533
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:00,609
And I don't even like Family Guy that much.

1534
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:01,649
I don't even care.

1535
01:39:02,529 --> 01:39:05,170
But that was right when those started becoming a thing.

1536
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:09,739
Like, collect coins from your buildings and wait.

1537
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:13,739
2012, 2013, that was when it first started.

1538
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:14,619
And then I figured it out.

1539
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:16,140
And I was like, all right, that's fucking stupid.

1540
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,420
I'm never doing that again.

1541
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,220
And then I bought like 1,400 Hearthstone cards

1542
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,500
over the course of a couple of years.

1543
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,619
It just never stopped.

1544
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:25,340
They just continued to do that formula

1545
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:26,699
in a few different other ways.

1546
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:35,090
Guys, it got to a point where I was buying Hearthstone cards

1547
01:39:36,109 --> 01:39:37,149
just to buy them.

1548
01:39:37,149 --> 01:39:38,670
And I didn't even...

1549
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,550
I was terrible.

1550
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:42,050
I was so bad at the game.

1551
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,409
I had no idea what the meta was.

1552
01:39:43,409 --> 01:39:44,529
I was fucking awful at it.

1553
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:46,289
But everybody was playing it.

1554
01:39:46,289 --> 01:39:49,250
And I was like, oh, I want Grom Hellscream too.

1555
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,729
Because this is a Grom deck.

1556
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,250
Stars told this story before.

1557
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,930
Back when Hearthstone was in its beta

1558
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,970
and they were giving closed out like keys to streamers and shit.

1559
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:03,409
I went into a bunch of people's channels with alt accounts

1560
01:40:03,409 --> 01:40:05,489
and tried to win key giveaways.

1561
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:09,300
I would sit in a street because people were doing like,

1562
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,420
oh, beta key giveaway.

1563
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:14,399
So I tried to find streams that I had a good chance to win.

1564
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,079
And I was just sitting there and I'd wait for a fucking beta key.

1565
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:19,119
Here we go.

1566
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,720
We're giving another two or three keys.

1567
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,520
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

1568
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,239
Okay, hold on.

1569
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:22,720
Me too.

1570
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:24,000
Give me one.

1571
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,840
These are confessions.

1572
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,520
I mean, I'm serious.

1573
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,859
Did I get one?

1574
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:32,500
No, I didn't.

1575
01:40:36,289 --> 01:40:36,609
All right.

1576
01:40:36,609 --> 01:40:38,770
I have to remember the validity of this

1577
01:40:40,989 --> 01:40:50,300
because I think Star got a key for me somehow.

1578
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,819
I think he like found one.

1579
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:53,659
Or he got it and he gave it to me.

1580
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:54,539
I don't even remember.

1581
01:41:01,539 --> 01:41:02,340
Found one.

1582
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:04,420
I don't even like remember how.

1583
01:41:07,069 --> 01:41:08,270
I was so obsessed.

1584
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,949
I was like, I need to play it so bad.

1585
01:41:09,949 --> 01:41:10,909
Please, anything.

1586
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:14,109
And then I got it and I didn't play it.

1587
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:17,010
I played it for like a week or two.

1588
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:18,289
And I was like, I'm not good at this.

1589
01:41:18,289 --> 01:41:18,850
I hate this.

1590
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:20,289
I suck at this.

1591
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,380
Money wasted.

1592
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,930
I'm so desperate to play it.

1593
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:40,289
I wanted it so bad.

1594
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:52,060
All right, that's enough gold.

1595
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,340
Yeah, I wanted like 300.

1596
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:58,050
Good thing to know that our donation is being pumped into Family Guy.

1597
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:01,600
You think I still play that?

1598
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
It's been like seven years.

1599
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:21,500
Die already.

1600
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,060
No, the money.

1601
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:27,779
No, I can't get that money either.

1602
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,500
Stream, you're a Family Guy, Tom.

1603
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:47,899
Oh my god.

1604
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:49,100
No, I have no juice left.

1605
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:51,060
I'm dead.

1606
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:52,319
I went down way too quick.

1607
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:53,359
Terrible.

1608
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:54,159
Horrible.

1609
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,199
Horrible.

1610
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:55,600
Horrible.

1611
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,479
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

1612
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:56,800
I'm okay.

1613
01:42:59,039 --> 01:42:59,439
Worms.

1614
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:01,840
Do the worm strategy.

1615
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:09,439
He fucking holy hand-grenaded me.

1616
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:14,180
Why is it bump?

1617
01:43:21,789 --> 01:43:23,069
No, stop coming up here.

1618
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:32,050
We want Family Guy.

1619
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,329
No, I don't want to play that.

1620
01:43:33,329 --> 01:43:34,210
That game sucks.

1621
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:43,069
It is the worst of all the worst potential of iPad.

1622
01:43:43,069 --> 01:43:44,670
Just money grab games.

1623
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:45,789
You don't want, I don't want to play.

1624
01:43:45,789 --> 01:43:47,229
You don't want to see that happen.

1625
01:43:47,229 --> 01:43:53,340
Okay, I get 350.

1626
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:54,300
No, I need, I need.

1627
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,260
Something's going to cost 350.

1628
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,779
I'm going to be pissed that I didn't do this.

1629
01:43:56,779 --> 01:44:09,420
This one's closer.

1630
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:17,619
I can't ignore this.

1631
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:19,619
I don't even know if the game exists anymore.

1632
01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:28,140
Hey, Lois.

1633
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:29,579
Get a load of this guy.

1634
01:44:29,579 --> 01:44:31,340
I don't even think the game exists.

1635
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:37,069
How come there's been no wands here?

1636
01:44:37,069 --> 01:44:38,670
This is minus 50% off.

1637
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:42,050
Prickly spore pod.

1638
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,010
Oh, here it is.

1639
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:46,180
Undercloud.

1640
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:47,140
Should I try it?

1641
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,659
Can't ignore this.

1642
01:44:49,659 --> 01:44:50,060
Hold on.

1643
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:56,909
What are you linking?

1644
01:44:56,909 --> 01:44:58,189
This is so stupid.

1645
01:44:58,829 --> 01:45:00,590
This is like zero effort.

1646
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:03,569
But it's, it's somehow a lot of effort.

1647
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:06,289
But at the same time, it's fucking zero effort too.

1648
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,050
Not that.

1649
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:14,939
Hold on.

1650
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:21,199
But did they have to save to my documents?

1651
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:29,760
Why did I save image as on desktop?

1652
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,020
Why is this not saving?

1653
01:45:38,819 --> 01:45:39,380
Oh, no.

1654
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,819
Get the file name off there, dude.

1655
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:52,430
All right, here we go.

1656
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:54,750
This is zero effort.

1657
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,760
I think I like Meg the most.

1658
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,979
From the time that I said the word family guy iPad game.

1659
01:46:09,979 --> 01:46:11,500
Why don't you start immediately?

1660
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,619
You started right then.

1661
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:15,659
And you finished two minutes ago and uploaded it.

1662
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:25,920
All right, what do I want?

1663
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,600
I want the, I want the thunder.

1664
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,239
I want to try it.

1665
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,109
I unlocked it.

1666
01:46:30,109 --> 01:46:31,789
Blood is 250.

1667
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:35,260
Wait, everything is 50% off.

1668
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,939
Oh, no, it's not.

1669
01:46:37,939 --> 01:46:41,500
It's just blood.

1670
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,869
What should I get?

1671
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,890
Chunk of soil.

1672
01:46:46,449 --> 01:46:47,819
Personal gravity field.

1673
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:51,760
Second wand is machine gun.

1674
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:55,340
Blood.

1675
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:01,020
And spore is another one.

1676
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,380
All right, well, we might as well get these out of the way.

1677
01:47:02,939 --> 01:47:08,289
I don't know what this has to do with family guy.

1678
01:47:08,289 --> 01:47:17,739
But what does this have to do with family?

1679
01:47:17,739 --> 01:47:19,260
We're on like a family guy kick right now.

1680
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,300
Does this have to do with family guy?

1681
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:30,159
There's a real face.

1682
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:35,729
I mean, it kind of looks fake.

1683
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:39,260
It looks a little bit fake.

1684
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:49,039
So handsome.

1685
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:56,079
Okay, thanks, mom.

1686
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,939
Yeah, thanks a lot, mom, for saying that.

1687
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:06,460
Real link, please.

1688
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:17,539
All right, I'm going, I'm going back to play Noito.

1689
01:48:17,539 --> 01:48:24,479
So why did you, what did you do to my face?

1690
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:26,750
Why did you do that to my face?

1691
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:31,819
I don't understand what the point of this was.

1692
01:48:31,819 --> 01:48:35,579
Why did you arch my back a little and give me a weird chin?

1693
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:36,380
I don't understand.

1694
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:46,270
You clicked the wrong one again.

1695
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,550
Okay, this is way better.

1696
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:53,760
I don't know.

1697
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,640
This could be real.

1698
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:11,390
Somebody said the missing link is not real.

1699
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:12,189
I don't think it is.

1700
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:17,699
It's just old man body.

1701
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:26,350
All old men over the age of like 85.

1702
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:32,020
This is terrible.

1703
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:37,149
But you put like a crispy filter on it though.

1704
01:49:37,149 --> 01:49:44,319
That makes it look a little worse, right?

1705
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:47,619
Escape from Dinosaur Island.

1706
01:49:47,619 --> 01:49:48,739
I don't, I'm not gonna play this.

1707
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:49,300
What do you want me to do?

1708
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,739
I'm not playing that right now.

1709
01:49:51,739 --> 01:49:55,100
Yeah, I've seen the toilet mouth one.

1710
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,460
All right, this is it.

1711
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,779
Last link and I'm done with links.

1712
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,689
Okay, yeah, this is good too.

1713
01:50:02,689 --> 01:50:09,520
This is your camera.

1714
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,640
I know the camera sucks.

1715
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:21,489
I know.

1716
01:50:21,569 --> 01:50:24,560
We've seen this one too.

1717
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,760
What is this umbrella?

1718
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:27,899
What is that?

1719
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:31,149
Why is there like a weird...

1720
01:50:31,149 --> 01:50:34,029
Oh, that's the weird studio lights that I used to have.

1721
01:50:34,029 --> 01:50:34,909
What is it doing in the room?

1722
01:50:34,909 --> 01:50:40,180
What's it doing in here?

1723
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,659
This office was as big as an airplane bathroom.

1724
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:43,140
How did I...

1725
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:53,279
What was this for?

1726
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,640
The light gun stream?

1727
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,079
But why would I have that?

1728
01:50:56,079 --> 01:51:00,579
Jim Carrey on set for The Grinch.

1729
01:51:00,579 --> 01:51:01,939
Oh, I'm not green.

1730
01:51:01,939 --> 01:51:02,979
So sorry about that.

1731
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,880
You know the things that like you...

1732
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,479
The things that you remembered for

1733
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:17,250
and the things like the legacy you leave behind

1734
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:22,060
gonna be a real lot of digging to find that for me.

1735
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:24,460
You're gonna have to really do a lot of weeding around.

1736
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:42,180
Mitch McConnell.

1737
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,239
Now, let me tell you about the stimulus.

1738
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:52,079
We are not ready to move forward on a stimulus.

1739
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:54,880
Not yet.

1740
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,960
Maybe soon we will move forward on that.

1741
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,800
Madam Speaker.

1742
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:03,890
Paul McCartney's.

1743
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:12,449
I think Paul McCartney's closer.

1744
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:14,529
Fuck that wrinkly asshole.

1745
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:18,430
Tony Hawk.

1746
01:52:19,069 --> 01:52:20,350
Okay, I'm done.

1747
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:20,829
I'm done.

1748
01:52:20,829 --> 01:52:21,229
I'm done.

1749
01:52:21,229 --> 01:52:21,949
I'm done.

1750
01:52:21,949 --> 01:52:22,609
I'm done.

1751
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:23,010
I'm done.

1752
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:23,250
I'm done.

1753
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:24,770
I'm going back to playing Noito.

1754
01:52:25,569 --> 01:52:28,640
It was in all caps, too.

1755
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,199
That was a bit...

1756
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:30,960
All right.

1757
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,600
I'm...

1758
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,079
Stop it.

1759
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:32,960
Enough.

1760
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,760
Silence.

1761
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:39,890
Do the spells.

1762
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:41,010
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

1763
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:42,289
We're playing a video game again.

1764
01:52:42,289 --> 01:52:42,529
All right.

1765
01:52:42,529 --> 01:52:44,449
This just creates a stormy cloud.

1766
01:52:44,449 --> 01:52:46,750
I need the third wand.

1767
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:48,189
This is kind of bad.

1768
01:52:48,189 --> 01:52:49,680
Someone's a spore pod.

1769
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,079
Let's just...

1770
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:51,600
I just want to see what it looks like individually.

1771
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:55,100
What am I doing?

1772
01:52:55,739 --> 01:52:56,060
All right.

1773
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:58,819
What does this do?

1774
01:52:58,819 --> 01:52:59,300
Whoa.

1775
01:52:59,300 --> 01:52:59,859
Whoa.

1776
01:52:59,859 --> 01:53:00,739
Does it hurt me?

1777
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:04,800
Does this explode?

1778
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,920
Does the projectile hurt me?

1779
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,779
Very important.

1780
01:53:10,829 --> 01:53:11,149
They do.

1781
01:53:11,149 --> 01:53:12,670
The projectile hurts me.

1782
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:16,989
So it is being removed.

1783
01:53:16,989 --> 01:53:17,390
Blood.

1784
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,300
Blood, blood, blood.

1785
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:19,539
Okay.

1786
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:20,960
So what?

1787
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,010
You just can cast blood on yourself?

1788
01:53:23,010 --> 01:53:24,050
Thunder cloud.

1789
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:24,979
This only has...

1790
01:53:28,699 --> 01:53:29,100
Okay.

1791
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:29,420
Move.

1792
01:53:29,979 --> 01:53:30,460
I can't move.

1793
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,399
Move, please.

1794
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:42,539
Why did I get stuck?

1795
01:53:42,539 --> 01:53:47,630
Because you froze the rain.

1796
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:50,670
You were standing in the rain and you froze inside the rain.

1797
01:53:50,670 --> 01:54:06,960
I was here.

1798
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:07,279
Okay.

1799
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,659
All right.

1800
01:54:08,659 --> 01:54:08,979
Let's go.

1801
01:54:08,979 --> 01:54:09,699
Go, go, go, go.

1802
01:54:09,699 --> 01:54:11,060
I'm like into this game.

1803
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:12,899
I need to get to at least floor five again.

1804
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:14,640
Integrate.

1805
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:14,880
No.

1806
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:16,960
No.

1807
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,279
If you keep asking for it, I'm not going to turn it on.

1808
01:54:24,029 --> 01:54:25,550
I will do Twitch integration after this.

1809
01:54:26,189 --> 01:54:28,750
You understand?

1810
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:35,520
If you do the integration, I will subscribe.

1811
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,340
Okay.

1812
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,060
Fucking hurry up.

1813
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:37,380
Come on.

1814
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,420
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1815
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:55,039
I subbed.

1816
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:55,600
What the fuck?

1817
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:56,000
I subbed.

1818
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:00,430
I need to get down to...

1819
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:01,869
I have to get down to at least the floor.

1820
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:03,390
Snow floor.

1821
01:55:03,949 --> 01:55:08,270
Respect our existence.

1822
01:55:09,229 --> 01:55:09,869
I am.

1823
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:10,270
Just wait.

1824
01:55:10,989 --> 01:55:12,350
I'm getting more comfortable in the game.

1825
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:14,510
I'm starting to understand how the game works.

1826
01:55:16,029 --> 01:55:19,779
It's becoming very clear what I need to do and where I need to go.

1827
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:26,270
Load this up so I can get down there.

1828
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:28,800
Quick commander.

1829
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,300
Where's the gold?

1830
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:31,699
There it is.

1831
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,659
My favorite slot machine is where's the gold?

1832
01:55:43,659 --> 01:55:46,460
By the way, if you wanted to know more lore, more confessions.

1833
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:53,920
Blow up, please.

1834
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,659
I thought it was Betty White.

1835
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:00,659
Yeah, Betty White isn't very good to me.

1836
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:01,140
I'll tell you.

1837
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:02,500
Betty White wasn't very good to me lately.

1838
01:56:04,859 --> 01:56:05,659
I haven't been...

1839
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,579
Okay, let me be clear about this.

1840
01:56:07,579 --> 01:56:13,739
I haven't been to the casino to play casino games since January of 2020.

1841
01:56:13,739 --> 01:56:15,340
So let's be clear about that first of all.

1842
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:31,949
Who just gave $50 to save Banana Bro integration this year?

1843
01:56:31,949 --> 01:56:32,189
Yeah.

1844
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:38,510
Like, very March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November.

1845
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:42,430
Yeah, so I went to the casino 10 months ago

1846
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:43,550
and hung out for a little while.

1847
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,859
Look out, he's sitting here.

1848
01:56:47,859 --> 01:56:50,180
All right, I'm going to die, so don't make fun of me yet.

1849
01:56:50,819 --> 01:56:56,939
And yeah, why would I want to go to a casino and like hang around there?

1850
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,250
No, thanks.

1851
01:57:04,909 --> 01:57:05,550
It's not blood.

1852
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,619
Go right, go right, go right.

1853
01:57:10,619 --> 01:57:11,979
I'm just taking a look.

1854
01:57:11,979 --> 01:57:13,600
I'm not picking that up.

1855
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,119
It's going to spawn like this worm boss.

1856
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,340
I already did this.

1857
01:57:18,899 --> 01:57:22,779
Who gave the $50?

1858
01:57:22,779 --> 01:57:23,739
I missed it.

1859
01:57:23,739 --> 01:57:25,020
It was 5,000 bits from...

1860
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,659
Who was it?

1861
01:57:26,659 --> 01:57:27,619
Who gave it?

1862
01:57:27,619 --> 01:57:33,039
It was me.

1863
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:33,439
No, it wasn't.

1864
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:33,840
Who was it?

1865
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:37,010
They say banana bros, like Unite or something.

1866
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:37,729
Whatever they said.

1867
01:57:37,729 --> 01:57:39,010
It was a lot of money.

1868
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:39,970
Wait, hold on a second.

1869
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:40,289
Let me see.

1870
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:44,210
I should have thought of these things saved.

1871
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:50,479
All right, it was Zurich Dah.

1872
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:51,439
Zurich Dah.

1873
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:52,479
Thanks, Zurich.

1874
01:57:52,479 --> 01:58:01,789
Okay, I'm just going to put this on screen for a second

1875
01:58:01,789 --> 01:58:02,430
because I don't even...

1876
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:03,710
I don't understand what this is.

1877
01:58:05,739 --> 01:58:06,220
Why, uh...

1878
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,229
Why did you just link this to me?

1879
01:58:09,229 --> 01:58:20,750
What's this supposed to be conveying?

1880
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:32,960
True.

1881
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,840
Spoilers?

1882
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,239
I...

1883
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:34,880
Spoilers...

1884
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:37,439
So you got a guy, throws another guy to the ground.

1885
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:41,659
What happens in, like, eight out of ten movies

1886
01:58:41,659 --> 01:58:43,100
that have ever released?

1887
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:52,380
What were we doing?

1888
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:54,399
Something was happening.

1889
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:54,880
What happened?

1890
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,239
There was a reason why I stopped.

1891
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,119
What did I stop for?

1892
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,470
What did I stop for?

1893
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:01,039
There was a reason why I stopped.

1894
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:04,430
No, it wasn't for Twitch integration.

1895
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:07,819
Oh, yeah, the donation.

1896
01:59:07,819 --> 01:59:09,340
Yeah, okay, we got it.

1897
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,119
Thank you for the 50 bucks.

1898
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:12,319
It's a lot of money.

1899
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:17,300
And I'll tell you,

1900
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:21,409
if you want to support the channel,

1901
01:59:21,409 --> 01:59:23,170
you don't got to give me 50 bucks.

1902
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,250
You're not going to give me 5,000 bits.

1903
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:28,699
I actually probably would prefer if you just subbed.

1904
01:59:28,699 --> 01:59:32,739
You know, people that...

1905
01:59:32,739 --> 01:59:34,420
People give so much money to this stream.

1906
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:36,619
It's unfucking believable.

1907
01:59:36,619 --> 01:59:39,520
People have given thousands of dollars to this stream.

1908
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,079
Thousands.

1909
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:48,880
And I can't even comprehend how much money that is.

1910
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,680
Ungrateful.

1911
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,479
No, no, I'm just...

1912
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:51,920
I'm just saying, I...

1913
01:59:51,920 --> 02:00:01,890
This channel sees so much support and so much money already

1914
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:06,210
that people drop in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month.

1915
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:08,220
It's a lot of fucking money.

1916
02:00:08,859 --> 02:00:10,859
And I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful for it, but...

1917
02:00:14,289 --> 02:00:15,649
And integrate us already.

1918
02:00:15,649 --> 02:00:16,609
I'm gonna.

1919
02:00:16,609 --> 02:00:22,909
You missed subs.

1920
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:24,430
They just came in right now.

1921
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:28,819
ZurichDuh gave 10 community subs on top of the 50 dollars.

1922
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:34,239
And Chrissy just gave 5 community subs.

1923
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:40,060
Thank you, both of you.

1924
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:41,819
DestroyDude gave 5 community subs as well.

1925
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:45,409
Alright, let's talk about this for just a second.

1926
02:00:45,409 --> 02:00:49,970
So, one of the reasons why, on top of the fact that I can stay here and stream longer

1927
02:00:49,970 --> 02:00:52,739
and not do the end of the stream reading donation thing,

1928
02:00:52,739 --> 02:00:57,220
there's been a lot less bit donations, right?

1929
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:59,630
Because I don't read them anymore.

1930
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:03,470
And a small portion of the reason why to do that

1931
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:06,430
is not just because of being able to sit here for longer

1932
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:08,859
with the pain problems that I have.

1933
02:01:08,859 --> 02:01:15,460
But also, people that give this channel a shitload of money,

1934
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:23,390
I would much prefer it if you maybe spent less on me and more on you.

1935
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:26,109
I know that some people can afford it, and I know there are some people

1936
02:01:26,109 --> 02:01:28,109
that watch this channel probably have fucking millions of dollars.

1937
02:01:28,109 --> 02:01:31,149
And that's awesome.

1938
02:01:31,149 --> 02:01:35,699
But I would much prefer it if you spent that money on yourself.

1939
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:39,069
Put me at the bottom of your list.

1940
02:01:39,069 --> 02:01:42,590
You guys take such good fucking care of me already.

1941
02:01:43,149 --> 02:01:47,069
It's unimaginable how much monetary support

1942
02:01:47,069 --> 02:01:48,989
just from subscriptions come into this channel.

1943
02:01:48,989 --> 02:01:52,750
You guys can do back of the napkin math.

1944
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:54,430
You know how many people are subbed to this channel.

1945
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:57,819
It's not public information.

1946
02:01:57,819 --> 02:02:06,819
So just be aware that although I do love that people give me that kind of money,

1947
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:10,430
I really hope that you're taking care of yourself first

1948
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:13,390
and only have me at the end of your list.

1949
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:19,779
Always.

1950
02:02:19,779 --> 02:02:21,380
He's begging for subs again.

1951
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:24,670
Please just give me subs.

1952
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:27,390
That's all I want.

1953
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:28,270
Makes three billion...

1954
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:29,069
No, what was it?

1955
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,439
If you look at the...

1956
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:39,970
Why, like, streamer net worth is like 140 billion dollars, right?

1957
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:41,489
It's something insane.

1958
02:02:41,489 --> 02:02:44,100
Somebody linked the website.

1959
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:47,300
It says my net worth is like 180 billion dollars.

1960
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:50,560
Somebody linked it to me like a few months ago.

1961
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,079
And there are a lot of people saying like,

1962
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:55,920
oh, wow, this is so wholesome.

1963
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:58,640
Wow, this is so wholesome of you.

1964
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:02,239
I make a lot of fucking money, you know?

1965
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:03,199
Like, I just...

1966
02:03:05,409 --> 02:03:09,619
I'm not necessarily refusing the money.

1967
02:03:09,619 --> 02:03:11,300
But you guys know, like, this...

1968
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:14,659
We crossed 10,000 subs back.

1969
02:03:14,659 --> 02:03:17,380
I don't have that now, but we did that back in January.

1970
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:20,020
That's absurd.

1971
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:22,899
That's an absurd amount of fucking money to give somebody.

1972
02:03:22,899 --> 02:03:29,180
And I don't want people to think that they have to give me like 100 bucks on top of that.

1973
02:03:31,649 --> 02:03:39,840
That's already a huge amount that I can't even comprehend people would do in the first place.

1974
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,039
Get on with the fucking game.

1975
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:48,819
No, I just want to make it clear.

1976
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:53,619
Because a lot of people were like upset that I got rid of the reading of the donations.

1977
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,460
And I can understand that.

1978
02:03:57,619 --> 02:03:59,539
There's another part to that, right?

1979
02:03:59,539 --> 02:04:00,659
All right, I'm gonna get on with the game.

1980
02:04:00,659 --> 02:04:01,300
I'm gonna get on with the game.

1981
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:04,989
Just know that like you guys take already fucking insane good care of me

1982
02:04:04,989 --> 02:04:06,270
with subscriptions alone.

1983
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:07,390
It's insane.

1984
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,800
So I'm gonna get on...

1985
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:12,159
That guy was a new viewer and I don't want him to think I'm an asshole.

1986
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:12,960
So I'm gonna keep going.

1987
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:19,020
We gotta like get the new viewers to stay.

1988
02:04:19,739 --> 02:04:23,340
Destroy the tablet quick.

1989
02:04:23,899 --> 02:04:37,899
Did I destroy it?

1990
02:04:37,899 --> 02:04:45,060
Does it say how I'm worth?

1991
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:48,579
And the point of me saying that this channel makes a lot of money is not to brag.

1992
02:04:48,579 --> 02:04:50,180
It's to tell you that I don't...

1993
02:04:50,739 --> 02:04:55,069
That if you want to give a thousand dollars to this channel in two weeks,

1994
02:04:55,789 --> 02:04:57,710
take care of yourself first, always.

1995
02:04:59,619 --> 02:05:01,220
I am last on that list.

1996
02:05:02,739 --> 02:05:11,220
Still flexing.

1997
02:05:11,859 --> 02:05:12,359
Yeah!

1998
02:05:15,949 --> 02:05:17,149
No, dude, come on.

1999
02:05:19,859 --> 02:05:24,899
DevilX just gave $50, 5000 bits and they say for our end of the list Andy.

2000
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:27,170
Okay, thank you.

2001
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,560
End of the list Andy.

2002
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:45,979
Thanks for the fucking insane amount of money.

2003
02:05:45,979 --> 02:05:48,300
Stop doing the permaban bet on Jedi Academy.

2004
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:50,380
I'm gonna play it like next week or something.

2005
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,180
I don't have enough money to do anything.

2006
02:05:53,180 --> 02:06:00,420
Don't kill that fish.

2007
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:01,979
All right, let's go.

2008
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,680
Millionaire streamer can't afford anything.

2009
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:10,899
Hey, what is this doing?

2010
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:15,869
Well, I can't tell you with confidence.

2011
02:06:15,869 --> 02:06:17,710
I can't tell you with confidence I'm not a millionaire.

2012
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:18,909
Let's make that clear.

2013
02:06:18,909 --> 02:06:21,550
I am not a millionaire, not even close.

2014
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:25,470
Oh, extra one capacity.

2015
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:33,250
If you had to be there, you know.

2016
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:39,680
If I had a billion dollars, I would open up like 30 clown schools across the country

2017
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:42,000
and put like make like clowns like cool again.

2018
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,119
That's what I would do.

2019
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:47,039
Peace with gods.

2020
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:55,149
High mana, low capacity.

2021
02:06:55,149 --> 02:06:56,670
Wait, maybe that one.

2022
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:03,100
Clowns cool again.

2023
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:06,979
Yeah, clowns were cool in like the fucking 1400s.

2024
02:07:06,979 --> 02:07:09,220
Like the 1200s or something when it was like,

2025
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:12,979
weren't they cool back like in like the like the medieval times?

2026
02:07:12,979 --> 02:07:14,100
Like jesters?

2027
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:17,489
Yeah, jesters were cool.

2028
02:07:17,489 --> 02:07:18,529
What are you talking about?

2029
02:07:18,529 --> 02:07:24,060
People liked the jester.

2030
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:29,890
I'm gonna go with this one.

2031
02:07:30,529 --> 02:07:31,810
You make peace with your gods.

2032
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:32,930
I don't know what that means.

2033
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:33,970
People hated the jester.

2034
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:34,529
No, they didn't.

2035
02:07:34,529 --> 02:07:37,630
It was like the king's right hand man.

2036
02:07:37,869 --> 02:07:39,710
Jester, come and spend time with me.

2037
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:42,670
And they would come out and dance and they'd all be happy.

2038
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:44,189
It was the king's like favorite person.

2039
02:07:45,569 --> 02:07:47,329
Clowns were cool when jesters were cool.

2040
02:07:47,890 --> 02:07:48,850
They were the clowns.

2041
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:50,609
I want to get that back.

2042
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:52,300
It's coping.

2043
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,260
Whatever.

2044
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:58,220
They helped with like policy decisions too, didn't they?

2045
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,140
And if this song wasn't good enough,

2046
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:12,300
then they were like fed to a bunch of lions.

2047
02:08:17,739 --> 02:08:19,520
Just like, you know, Twitch chat.

2048
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:20,560
My joke's not good enough.

2049
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:22,640
You guys scream at me and tell me I'm just ugly.

2050
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:30,789
It's true.

2051
02:08:39,949 --> 02:08:41,310
This has got point blank shotgun in the face.

2052
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:41,810
Come on.

2053
02:08:42,109 --> 02:08:51,789
The guys with the guns are the worst.

2054
02:08:51,789 --> 02:08:52,510
They're so accurate.

2055
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:53,390
They're way too accurate.

2056
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:57,260
I want that gold.

2057
02:08:59,119 --> 02:08:59,619
Fuck you.

2058
02:09:00,539 --> 02:09:01,979
Not you, game.

2059
02:09:01,979 --> 02:09:10,579
Turn on Twitch.

2060
02:09:19,939 --> 02:09:20,739
Do what now?

2061
02:09:20,739 --> 02:09:21,460
What do you want me to do?

2062
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:24,189
All right, I'm getting distracted and I have to stop.

2063
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:24,689
I have to play.

2064
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:30,899
No, no, I wanted to...

2065
02:09:30,899 --> 02:09:31,779
I didn't want to...

2066
02:09:31,779 --> 02:09:35,840
I wanted to cover myself in the water so I could be alive.

2067
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:59,649
I'm getting to floor four before I do any Twitch integration.

2068
02:09:59,649 --> 02:10:06,899
Sorry.

2069
02:10:06,899 --> 02:10:07,460
You promised.

2070
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:08,500
I told you it wasn't going to happen,

2071
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:11,220
but not until I was satisfied with the base game.

2072
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:16,850
Plus, don't you guys know that once the Twitch integrations turned on,

2073
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:18,210
chat is going to be over?

2074
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:20,850
Because you have to like spam symbols or words and shit.

2075
02:10:21,489 --> 02:10:24,819
That's when you can't chat anymore.

2076
02:10:24,819 --> 02:10:27,779
It's just going to be a flood of nonsense and no one will be able to chat.

2077
02:10:27,779 --> 02:10:30,579
So I want like a couple hours, two, three hours of chat.

2078
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:35,380
And then just one, two, three, or four spammed over and over again.

2079
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:47,199
I didn't say to do that now.

2080
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:55,920
Well, they're getting a head start.

2081
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:56,720
Okay.

2082
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:02,319
If you were really good at video games,

2083
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:03,680
you'd probably really like this game.

2084
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:04,399
Just to tell you.

2085
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:06,079
Just to give you like a little bit of insight.

2086
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:11,779
It's one of those games.

2087
02:11:11,779 --> 02:11:13,060
It's one of those if you're really good at games,

2088
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:13,779
you're going to love this one.

2089
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,239
Did he actually just hit me with that?

2090
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:18,640
No.

2091
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:22,210
Waffle or pancakes?

2092
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:22,529
Neither.

2093
02:11:22,529 --> 02:11:23,250
I think they're both bad.

2094
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:25,970
Oh, here we go.

2095
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:26,470
Okay.

2096
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:30,699
This one is...

2097
02:11:31,579 --> 02:11:32,300
Just take it.

2098
02:11:32,859 --> 02:11:35,090
It's just a shitty bomb though.

2099
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:35,729
Yeah, this sucks.

2100
02:11:38,130 --> 02:11:38,689
What is this?

2101
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:43,569
Firebolt?

2102
02:11:43,569 --> 02:11:44,930
And what's this one?

2103
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:47,260
It's just as awful.

2104
02:11:48,619 --> 02:11:49,100
Okay.

2105
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:49,819
Well, this sucks.

2106
02:11:52,189 --> 02:11:52,829
You got baited?

2107
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:53,470
Well, no.

2108
02:11:53,470 --> 02:11:53,869
I don't...

2109
02:11:53,869 --> 02:11:54,369
Look.

2110
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:57,619
When I go to a breakfast place,

2111
02:11:57,619 --> 02:11:59,220
I'll just give you a good indicator of what I mean.

2112
02:12:00,659 --> 02:12:01,779
When I go to a breakfast place,

2113
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:03,300
and I look at the menu,

2114
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:06,420
I never, ever, ever, ever

2115
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:07,939
order the pancakes or the waffles.

2116
02:12:07,939 --> 02:12:08,180
Ever.

2117
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:08,819
It's always on there,

2118
02:12:08,819 --> 02:12:09,539
but I don't order it.

2119
02:12:09,539 --> 02:12:10,039
Ever.

2120
02:12:11,729 --> 02:12:12,289
Waffles?

2121
02:12:12,289 --> 02:12:12,789
Never.

2122
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:17,859
Now, if my breakfast does come with pancakes,

2123
02:12:17,859 --> 02:12:19,140
I will enjoy one.

2124
02:12:19,939 --> 02:12:22,239
I'm of the opinion that pancakes...

2125
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:25,359
They give you like a stack of three or four of them,

2126
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:26,560
and it's too hard to eat all of them.

2127
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:27,439
You always just eat one.

2128
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,439
Or two, and you can't eat the rest of them.

2129
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,210
I got a bomb down there.

2130
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:43,619
It's a bad take?

2131
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,659
No, I mean, I like pancakes,

2132
02:12:46,659 --> 02:12:48,100
but they're just kind of too much sometimes.

2133
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:52,699
I don't think that's an unpopular opinion.

2134
02:12:53,340 --> 02:13:07,420
I'll tell you, my favorite breakfast item is...

2135
02:13:08,939 --> 02:13:09,659
Have I told you?

2136
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:10,140
You guys know?

2137
02:13:11,739 --> 02:13:12,380
You guys know?

2138
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,159
Corned beef hash.

2139
02:13:21,310 --> 02:13:22,029
Corned beef hash.

2140
02:13:22,989 --> 02:13:24,109
Done on the skillet.

2141
02:13:24,109 --> 02:13:26,430
Nice and crispy and delicious.

2142
02:13:26,989 --> 02:13:29,390
With a over medium egg on top of it.

2143
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:30,430
Or not over easy.

2144
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:31,390
I'm not an over easy guy.

2145
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:34,100
Over medium egg right on top.

2146
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,380
Just laid on top of it.

2147
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,619
I like a jammy yolk.

2148
02:13:37,619 --> 02:13:38,739
I don't like a runny yolk.

2149
02:13:38,739 --> 02:13:41,489
What is going on up here?

2150
02:13:41,489 --> 02:13:42,779
Oh, shit.

2151
02:13:43,659 --> 02:13:44,380
This is perfect.

2152
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:45,340
Let me in there.

2153
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:51,010
A nice warm jammy yolk is better than a runny yolk.

2154
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:52,210
It's way easier to handle.

2155
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:57,840
There's a lot.

2156
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,039
Look at all these people in there.

2157
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:00,800
This is a fucking Minecraft spawner room.

2158
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:15,180
Ax HP.

2159
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:15,659
Nice.

2160
02:14:15,659 --> 02:14:16,159
All right.

2161
02:14:16,859 --> 02:14:17,359
Leaf.

2162
02:14:17,579 --> 02:14:22,699
You're the guy that owns 12 things at McDonald's.

2163
02:14:23,659 --> 02:14:24,779
There's so much gold left.

2164
02:14:24,779 --> 02:14:25,579
I'm sorry.

2165
02:14:25,579 --> 02:14:26,300
The gold.

2166
02:14:28,899 --> 02:14:29,300
I know.

2167
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:29,619
I can't.

2168
02:14:29,619 --> 02:14:32,819
I saw people talking about pancakes and I fucked up.

2169
02:14:33,779 --> 02:14:41,859
Torch.

2170
02:14:41,859 --> 02:14:42,819
Electric torch.

2171
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:44,909
Rain cloud.

2172
02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:46,909
Chain bolt.

2173
02:14:46,909 --> 02:14:47,630
Let's try that one.

2174
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:49,600
Oh, yeah.

2175
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,560
Get rid of these like...

2176
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,119
Wait, wait, wait.

2177
02:14:51,119 --> 02:14:51,619
Okay.

2178
02:14:52,579 --> 02:14:53,619
Image and speed.

2179
02:14:53,619 --> 02:14:54,979
Mana drain 80.

2180
02:14:54,979 --> 02:14:55,779
Okay.

2181
02:14:55,779 --> 02:14:56,819
So let's see.

2182
02:14:56,819 --> 02:14:58,989
This has 170.

2183
02:14:59,630 --> 02:15:00,430
160.

2184
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:02,659
All right.

2185
02:15:02,659 --> 02:15:04,659
So this one is the one I want to use.

2186
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,420
Get rid of this bomb.

2187
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:09,069
Put that on there.

2188
02:15:09,069 --> 02:15:09,789
What does this look like?

2189
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:13,329
Oh, that's a Star Wars blaster sound.

2190
02:15:13,970 --> 02:15:14,770
I like it already.

2191
02:15:16,989 --> 02:15:24,300
It's a delicious link.

2192
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:48,670
I guess.

2193
02:15:52,829 --> 02:15:54,189
Mayonnaise soft drink.

2194
02:15:54,989 --> 02:15:56,109
What would that even taste like?

2195
02:15:56,750 --> 02:16:00,500
I feel like it'd be impossible to capture the delicious,

2196
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,899
deep flavor of mayonnaise in a liquid like that.

2197
02:16:02,899 --> 02:16:03,539
Like in a drink.

2198
02:16:06,909 --> 02:16:07,710
This would stink.

2199
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:10,319
You would...

2200
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:11,039
And it would...

2201
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:11,680
Oh.

2202
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:12,800
It would smell immediately.

2203
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,359
It would just stink.

2204
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
This is the kind of drink that you open,

2205
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,760
and the person that is upstairs in your house

2206
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:21,359
can smell what you're doing downstairs.

2207
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:34,799
Can I combine that with...

2208
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:35,680
Let me try this.

2209
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,959
So this is spark bolt and chain bolt.

2210
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:44,350
Oh, that sucks.

2211
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,389
Oh, it's because it's not...

2212
02:16:45,389 --> 02:16:46,190
It's not a shuffle.

2213
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:54,860
Yeah.

2214
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:57,219
Damage 25.

2215
02:16:57,219 --> 02:16:58,420
Damage 3.

2216
02:16:59,059 --> 02:16:59,969
That's not bad.

2217
02:16:59,969 --> 02:17:01,090
Oh, what about one of these other ones?

2218
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:03,569
Bouncing?

2219
02:17:03,569 --> 02:17:04,450
Maybe bouncing?

2220
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:05,090
Let's try that.

2221
02:17:05,729 --> 02:17:12,079
No.

2222
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:12,799
No, it sucks.

2223
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,299
This one is shuffle.

2224
02:17:25,299 --> 02:17:29,329
Yeah, get rid of the bombs.

2225
02:17:29,329 --> 02:17:30,129
I think they're worthless.

2226
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:42,879
Shuffle bad.

2227
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:45,059
Shuffle bad.

2228
02:17:45,059 --> 02:17:45,379
Okay.

2229
02:17:46,579 --> 02:17:50,430
I'm going to keep...

2230
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:51,549
I like the bouncy.

2231
02:17:51,549 --> 02:17:55,899
I don't even need this wand.

2232
02:17:55,899 --> 02:17:57,979
I guess I could do double bomb.

2233
02:17:57,979 --> 02:17:59,260
What is double bomb going to do for me?

2234
02:17:59,819 --> 02:18:02,239
That would be pretty cool, right?

2235
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:09,100
Shuffle sucks.

2236
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:10,299
It randomizes the order.

2237
02:18:10,299 --> 02:18:10,540
Yeah.

2238
02:18:12,989 --> 02:18:13,790
I'll keep this one now.

2239
02:18:16,049 --> 02:18:17,409
The rest of these, I don't think are very good.

2240
02:18:17,409 --> 02:18:18,610
Maybe a rain cloud.

2241
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:19,729
Might as well try it, right?

2242
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:22,540
It's a watery weather phenomenon.

2243
02:18:25,629 --> 02:18:26,510
Eh.

2244
02:18:26,510 --> 02:18:30,979
Put bouncy into the second wand.

2245
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:34,180
Okay.

2246
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:34,659
Yeah, because it's...

2247
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:38,270
Holy shit.

2248
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:38,510
Right?

2249
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:38,750
Okay.

2250
02:18:43,649 --> 02:18:44,049
I don't even...

2251
02:18:44,049 --> 02:18:45,409
This wand is kind of useless now.

2252
02:18:50,299 --> 02:18:51,020
Wait, what about...

2253
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:51,500
Okay.

2254
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:52,540
Cast elate to 0.2.

2255
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:54,299
Cast elate 0.4.

2256
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:56,459
Recharge 0.6.

2257
02:18:56,459 --> 02:18:56,860
Recharge...

2258
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:57,819
Oh, put this up here.

2259
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:00,799
Mana.

2260
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:08,959
Oh, this sucks for mana.

2261
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,170
Whatever.

2262
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:12,180
All right.

2263
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:12,579
That's fine.

2264
02:19:12,579 --> 02:19:13,139
This looks good.

2265
02:19:14,659 --> 02:19:20,139
Knock back on spells?

2266
02:19:20,139 --> 02:19:20,700
No.

2267
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,579
Wand experimenter?

2268
02:19:21,579 --> 02:19:22,459
I don't know what that means.

2269
02:19:22,459 --> 02:19:23,500
Faster wands.

2270
02:19:24,059 --> 02:19:25,180
I feel like that's good.

2271
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:30,700
I feel like that's good.

2272
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:35,549
All wands you carry to link herring

2273
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:37,549
gain a bonus to their cast elate.

2274
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,500
Holy shit.

2275
02:19:42,059 --> 02:19:44,940
Oh my god.

2276
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:46,700
That's kind of ridiculous.

2277
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:52,510
I can just go into a room and just do that.

2278
02:19:52,510 --> 02:19:52,829
Okay.

2279
02:19:52,829 --> 02:19:54,190
So I'm just going to go into a room,

2280
02:19:54,190 --> 02:19:55,069
get in the middle, and go.

2281
02:19:55,950 --> 02:19:57,200
All right.

2282
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:57,840
This should be the run.

2283
02:19:59,969 --> 02:20:00,850
Wand go brr.

2284
02:20:01,969 --> 02:20:04,299
It's green too.

2285
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:06,559
That makes you...

2286
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:07,040
What did you say?

2287
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,600
Even funnier.

2288
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,979
Oh, automatically.

2289
02:20:10,979 --> 02:20:11,620
Right off the bat,

2290
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:13,219
we got a fucking legendary wand.

2291
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:16,020
Shuffle.

2292
02:20:17,170 --> 02:20:18,209
Above and below.

2293
02:20:18,209 --> 02:20:19,409
Cast three spells.

2294
02:20:19,409 --> 02:20:22,270
Ahead, above, and below the caster.

2295
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:23,709
Reduce the spread of the spell.

2296
02:20:24,719 --> 02:20:26,959
And then it's a spark bolt with timer.

2297
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:47,760
This thing's terrible.

2298
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:58,219
Why is that cool?

2299
02:20:58,219 --> 02:20:59,739
It looks like it could be so cool.

2300
02:20:59,739 --> 02:21:02,829
This is not even doing the thing it's saying it's doing.

2301
02:21:02,829 --> 02:21:07,040
Isn't this supposed to be shooting above and below me?

2302
02:21:09,069 --> 02:21:09,469
Ow.

2303
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:13,120
All right.

2304
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:13,520
Let's go.

2305
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:19,540
It has cause shuffles on.

2306
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:27,200
Oh, whatever.

2307
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,079
Safety protocol?

2308
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:29,520
Let's go do that before I go anywhere.

2309
02:21:30,319 --> 02:21:32,590
Is it safe down there yet?

2310
02:21:32,590 --> 02:21:35,950
This thing is awesome.

2311
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:36,590
I love it already.

2312
02:21:37,309 --> 02:21:43,360
All right.

2313
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:44,239
What's this?

2314
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:45,389
Shuffle?

2315
02:21:45,389 --> 02:21:47,709
No.

2316
02:21:47,709 --> 02:21:48,909
This is energy sphere.

2317
02:21:51,649 --> 02:21:56,020
Recharge time.

2318
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:57,219
2.8 seconds.

2319
02:21:57,219 --> 02:21:57,780
Holy shit.

2320
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:58,739
Throw this thing in the trash.

2321
02:21:59,299 --> 02:22:08,559
It's four spells per cast, though.

2322
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:11,739
Wait.

2323
02:22:11,739 --> 02:22:12,930
All right.

2324
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:13,729
Let me try it.

2325
02:22:13,729 --> 02:22:22,370
That's awful.

2326
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:34,129
I mean, maybe if I put...

2327
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:35,889
Maybe I'll hold on to this.

2328
02:22:35,889 --> 02:22:36,530
If I do, yeah.

2329
02:22:36,530 --> 02:22:37,809
Four spells might make this pretty good.

2330
02:22:37,809 --> 02:22:39,329
What about these four up here?

2331
02:22:39,329 --> 02:22:41,540
I'm holding on to this thing.

2332
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:49,100
Keep the chain bolt, though.

2333
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:49,260
All right.

2334
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:49,979
What should I replace?

2335
02:22:49,979 --> 02:22:50,459
This one.

2336
02:22:50,459 --> 02:22:51,100
This one sucks.

2337
02:22:51,819 --> 02:22:52,940
Yeah.

2338
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:53,819
Get rid of this dumb thing.

2339
02:22:54,459 --> 02:23:03,620
Keep going.

2340
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:08,899
Fuck this wand.

2341
02:23:08,899 --> 02:23:09,139
All right.

2342
02:23:09,139 --> 02:23:09,700
That's what I said.

2343
02:23:10,659 --> 02:23:15,629
Why is this fire going on here?

2344
02:23:15,629 --> 02:23:17,340
How is there fire in water?

2345
02:23:18,379 --> 02:23:18,780
What is...

2346
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:19,420
Something on the ground.

2347
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:23,069
Coal vein?

2348
02:23:23,069 --> 02:23:23,870
Oh, it's water.

2349
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:24,350
Oh, drink.

2350
02:23:24,989 --> 02:23:33,979
Chain bolt is homing?

2351
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:38,739
Doesn't seem very homing.

2352
02:23:39,379 --> 02:23:43,219
Is it?

2353
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,659
Okay.

2354
02:23:47,659 --> 02:23:48,299
I like it.

2355
02:23:48,299 --> 02:23:48,700
You're right.

2356
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:49,260
It's very good.

2357
02:23:50,059 --> 02:23:57,149
I don't want to go yet.

2358
02:23:57,149 --> 02:23:59,360
I only have 100 bucks.

2359
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:00,159
No, I'm not going yet.

2360
02:24:05,709 --> 02:24:07,149
Unbanned the word Lego.

2361
02:24:07,149 --> 02:24:08,829
Why would Lego be banned on the channel?

2362
02:24:08,829 --> 02:24:09,469
You just said it.

2363
02:24:09,469 --> 02:24:10,110
What?

2364
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:10,590
Wait.

2365
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:11,549
Lego is banned?

2366
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:15,819
It's the word Lego banned.

2367
02:24:16,379 --> 02:24:28,829
Does it go through walls?

2368
02:24:28,829 --> 02:24:28,989
No.

2369
02:24:29,549 --> 02:24:38,219
This floor sucks.

2370
02:24:38,219 --> 02:24:38,860
There's nothing here.

2371
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:42,209
I have to go all the way around to get anywhere?

2372
02:24:42,209 --> 02:24:49,309
What the hell?

2373
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:59,729
I guess I'm going to go over here.

2374
02:24:59,729 --> 02:25:07,440
Okay.

2375
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,159
Here we go.

2376
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:08,559
Enemies.

2377
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:09,280
Somebody.

2378
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,340
Something.

2379
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:13,219
Fight.

2380
02:25:13,219 --> 02:25:14,579
A attack.

2381
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:24,479
Oh, what's this?

2382
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:24,879
Herbie.

2383
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:27,469
Chili egg.

2384
02:25:27,469 --> 02:25:29,440
Oh, I'm going to save that.

2385
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:30,719
And I can go down here.

2386
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:31,840
I don't have anything that...

2387
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,799
I have nothing that explodes.

2388
02:25:38,459 --> 02:25:39,739
I don't have anything that explodes.

2389
02:25:39,739 --> 02:25:45,790
What about the bomb wand?

2390
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:46,350
Yeah, hold on.

2391
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:46,750
I'll go get it.

2392
02:25:47,149 --> 02:25:48,270
I actually might be able to get up.

2393
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:48,829
Hold on.

2394
02:25:48,829 --> 02:25:54,750
I love this thing.

2395
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:56,750
I hope I can power this thing up like crazy.

2396
02:25:57,389 --> 02:26:02,530
That hurt.

2397
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:05,280
Unban the word Odama.

2398
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:06,159
No.

2399
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:09,389
That's my least favorite video game.

2400
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:11,069
That's staying banned forever.

2401
02:26:13,379 --> 02:26:14,340
That looks pretty good.

2402
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:14,579
All right.

2403
02:26:14,579 --> 02:26:15,620
I got to go get the bomb wand.

2404
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:20,219
Look this shit over.

2405
02:26:20,219 --> 02:26:20,940
Look at all this stuff.

2406
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:21,579
All right.

2407
02:26:21,579 --> 02:26:22,459
The bomb wand it is.

2408
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:30,959
Where is it?

2409
02:26:30,959 --> 02:26:32,319
It was this one down here, right?

2410
02:26:32,319 --> 02:26:33,280
What the fuck is this?

2411
02:26:35,379 --> 02:26:36,020
Oh, God.

2412
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:40,700
Heavy spread and TNT?

2413
02:26:41,579 --> 02:26:42,590
All right.

2414
02:26:42,590 --> 02:26:43,790
I got to move some things.

2415
02:26:43,790 --> 02:26:45,389
What do I replace this with right now?

2416
02:26:46,110 --> 02:26:46,510
This one?

2417
02:26:47,549 --> 02:26:51,069
I'm going to come back for four.

2418
02:26:51,069 --> 02:26:53,250
Let's blow this shit up.

2419
02:26:53,250 --> 02:27:04,059
All right.

2420
02:27:04,059 --> 02:27:04,540
What is it?

2421
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:06,670
This looks good.

2422
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:12,450
It's a double spell fire bolt.

2423
02:27:13,469 --> 02:27:14,270
Heavy spread.

2424
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:18,750
That's terrible.

2425
02:27:19,309 --> 02:27:23,940
How did I light on fire?

2426
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:31,250
All right.

2427
02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:32,930
Let's blow this wall up.

2428
02:27:51,059 --> 02:27:52,659
Gold.

2429
02:27:52,659 --> 02:27:52,979
Yeah.

2430
02:27:53,540 --> 02:27:57,840
How much money is that?

2431
02:28:13,870 --> 02:28:14,510
Dude, easy.

2432
02:28:15,389 --> 02:28:18,819
I got to get in here.

2433
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,559
Can you please turn off the sharpness filter in your OBS?

2434
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:23,840
What are you doing?

2435
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:27,250
Sharpness filter in your OBS.

2436
02:28:27,250 --> 02:28:28,930
It's not chat that is sharpening their images.

2437
02:28:28,930 --> 02:28:29,649
It's your program.

2438
02:28:29,649 --> 02:28:32,209
You turned it on one time during little hope to prove something about pixels.

2439
02:28:32,209 --> 02:28:33,649
And ever since you forgot to turn it off.

2440
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:47,780
Sharpness filter?

2441
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:01,899
It's real.

2442
02:29:01,899 --> 02:29:02,540
It's real.

2443
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:03,100
It's real.

2444
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:03,579
All right.

2445
02:29:03,579 --> 02:29:04,139
It's real.

2446
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:05,500
It's real.

2447
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:07,340
Let's hold on.

2448
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:09,709
It's real.

2449
02:29:09,709 --> 02:29:10,750
You guys aren't fucking around.

2450
02:29:14,909 --> 02:29:20,860
I thought they were deep fried like crispy memes or something.

2451
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:21,899
I didn't know.

2452
02:29:21,899 --> 02:29:24,459
I was wondering why everybody was doing this today.

2453
02:29:32,059 --> 02:29:33,020
God damn it.

2454
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:48,340
This is what it was.

2455
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:48,739
Okay.

2456
02:29:48,739 --> 02:29:50,020
Well, turn it off.

2457
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:50,579
It looks...

2458
02:29:50,579 --> 02:29:52,100
Doesn't it look worse though?

2459
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:53,299
It looks terrible.

2460
02:29:53,299 --> 02:29:55,040
I like want it to look like this.

2461
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:56,719
Does it look awful when it's not on?

2462
02:29:56,719 --> 02:29:57,680
I feel like I can't see.

2463
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:00,780
And I hate this.

2464
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:01,899
I want it back on.

2465
02:30:01,899 --> 02:30:06,989
Okay.

2466
02:30:06,989 --> 02:30:08,510
What do the other ones look like then?

2467
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:12,940
Yeah, I was curious.

2468
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:16,350
I was like, why does everybody have this on?

2469
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:17,229
Even this shit.

2470
02:30:18,299 --> 02:30:19,100
Even this.

2471
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:21,180
I was like, what's with the low quality?

2472
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:35,059
Okay.

2473
02:30:35,059 --> 02:30:35,459
We...

2474
02:30:35,459 --> 02:30:42,079
I was wondering why everything looked like a TV from the 90s.

2475
02:30:42,079 --> 02:30:46,079
This was considered having a good cable box back in like 1991, by the way.

2476
02:30:46,079 --> 02:30:50,639
Unbelievable.

2477
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:50,879
Okay.

2478
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:52,239
Well, thank you for telling me that.

2479
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:59,020
For a second, I thought it was on the game too.

2480
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:00,459
I was like, holy shit, that's bad.

2481
02:31:00,459 --> 02:31:01,860
All right.

2482
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:02,500
Let's go.

2483
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:09,629
How do I get up here?

2484
02:31:09,629 --> 02:31:14,559
I don't want to run out of these.

2485
02:31:14,559 --> 02:31:14,879
I can't...

2486
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:15,520
I can't...

2487
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,239
That's not reliable.

2488
02:31:18,659 --> 02:31:19,540
I gotta go all the way around.

2489
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:30,239
Sharpen the game.

2490
02:31:30,239 --> 02:31:31,760
The game is already really sharp.

2491
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:36,159
I don't want any more people to leave that haven't already.

2492
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:44,510
Get that poison shit out of here.

2493
02:31:45,069 --> 02:31:49,329
Get it off.

2494
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:02,989
Deep fried.

2495
02:32:02,989 --> 02:32:03,469
Yeah.

2496
02:32:03,469 --> 02:32:03,870
All right.

2497
02:32:03,870 --> 02:32:06,110
Uh, I can't get over there, guys.

2498
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:16,350
I'm gonna have to arc these in a way that it hits and explodes at the right time.

2499
02:32:16,909 --> 02:32:18,110
I'm like kind of far away.

2500
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:22,819
Come on.

2501
02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:23,780
I got five more attempts.

2502
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:24,020
Come on.

2503
02:32:25,139 --> 02:32:31,229
Come on.

2504
02:32:32,879 --> 02:32:33,120
No.

2505
02:32:34,989 --> 02:32:35,229
Yes.

2506
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:45,549
What is this?

2507
02:32:45,549 --> 02:32:46,829
Can you replace something?

2508
02:32:46,829 --> 02:32:48,000
Return.

2509
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,719
After a period of time, you'll be returned to where you cast the spell.

2510
02:32:52,930 --> 02:32:54,129
That's a torch?

2511
02:32:54,129 --> 02:32:59,170
I just want to see.

2512
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:02,899
Ow.

2513
02:33:02,899 --> 02:33:03,139
Don't...

2514
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:05,409
Okay.

2515
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:05,889
Okay.

2516
02:33:05,889 --> 02:33:06,370
Stop it.

2517
02:33:06,370 --> 02:33:06,850
Stop.

2518
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:07,250
Stop.

2519
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:07,649
Stop.

2520
02:33:07,649 --> 02:33:08,850
What the fuck is happening?

2521
02:33:09,569 --> 02:33:15,170
Fuck this thing.

2522
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:19,389
I'm not dead.

2523
02:33:19,389 --> 02:33:19,950
I'm not dead.

2524
02:33:19,950 --> 02:33:20,350
I'm fine.

2525
02:33:20,909 --> 02:33:21,709
I can't die here.

2526
02:33:22,270 --> 02:33:24,209
What does this do?

2527
02:33:24,209 --> 02:33:24,930
Faster wands.

2528
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:25,250
All right.

2529
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:26,129
I don't blow this.

2530
02:33:26,129 --> 02:33:26,770
I gotta...

2531
02:33:26,770 --> 02:33:27,729
Can I heal somehow?

2532
02:33:29,819 --> 02:33:30,139
Ah!

2533
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:33,090
All right.

2534
02:33:33,090 --> 02:33:46,180
It's fine.

2535
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:47,059
Fly to the moon.

2536
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:58,579
I miss every shot.

2537
02:33:58,579 --> 02:33:58,819
Okay.

2538
02:33:58,819 --> 02:33:58,979
No.

2539
02:33:58,979 --> 02:33:59,219
He's...

2540
02:33:59,219 --> 02:33:59,459
I'm good.

2541
02:33:59,459 --> 02:34:00,020
I'm good.

2542
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:16,690
He's checking.

2543
02:34:16,690 --> 02:34:17,329
I don't want to die.

2544
02:34:23,549 --> 02:34:23,950
God.

2545
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:24,190
Okay.

2546
02:34:25,819 --> 02:34:27,579
Good.

2547
02:34:27,579 --> 02:34:27,899
We're good.

2548
02:34:27,899 --> 02:34:28,299
We're good.

2549
02:34:28,299 --> 02:34:29,579
Just don't get killed.

2550
02:34:30,459 --> 02:34:32,370
That's a big thing over there.

2551
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:33,090
That's a huge enemy.

2552
02:34:33,889 --> 02:34:38,829
Instead, you dropped a lot of gold.

2553
02:34:38,829 --> 02:34:39,709
That's a lot of money.

2554
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,000
Don't touch it.

2555
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:44,319
It's too...

2556
02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:44,879
It's a risk.

2557
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:45,360
Too risky.

2558
02:34:49,579 --> 02:34:52,219
My god.

2559
02:34:52,219 --> 02:34:52,459
No.

2560
02:35:07,469 --> 02:35:08,190
No.

2561
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:09,229
I didn't...

2562
02:35:09,229 --> 02:35:10,829
Why did I think for some reason

2563
02:35:10,829 --> 02:35:12,030
that if you went to the portal

2564
02:35:12,030 --> 02:35:13,149
that it took off status effects?

2565
02:35:13,149 --> 02:35:13,790
I don't know why.

2566
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:14,030
No.

2567
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:14,270
I'm not...

2568
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:14,590
No.

2569
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:15,629
I'm so pissed off.

2570
02:35:15,629 --> 02:35:16,270
No integration.

2571
02:35:17,229 --> 02:35:17,549
No.

2572
02:35:17,549 --> 02:35:18,110
No integration.

2573
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:18,670
I'm mad now.

2574
02:35:19,229 --> 02:35:20,670
I have to be happy for the integration.

2575
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:23,889
I'm not gonna say that.

2576
02:35:23,889 --> 02:35:24,690
Fix this, please.

2577
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:30,500
Fix this.

2578
02:35:31,139 --> 02:35:31,379
Okay.

2579
02:35:31,379 --> 02:35:32,420
I'll fix it.

2580
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:47,329
Pretty good Game Boy Advance game, I will say.

2581
02:35:47,329 --> 02:35:54,719
Okay.

2582
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:55,200
One...

2583
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:55,680
One more.

2584
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:56,000
And then...

2585
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:56,319
Okay.

2586
02:35:56,319 --> 02:35:56,879
One more.

2587
02:35:56,879 --> 02:35:57,520
And then I'm gonna pee.

2588
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,040
And then I'm gonna do integration.

2589
02:35:59,040 --> 02:35:59,600
Okay.

2590
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:02,260
I want a good one.

2591
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:07,549
I just keep getting distracted.

2592
02:36:07,549 --> 02:36:08,670
No more distractions.

2593
02:36:08,670 --> 02:36:09,309
Okay?

2594
02:36:09,309 --> 02:36:10,270
No more.

2595
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:11,629
If you have something that you have to tell me,

2596
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:13,149
tell me after class.

2597
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:16,750
No more distractions.

2598
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:18,510
Don't bring up like Family Guy iPad games.

2599
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:21,389
Don't bring up like how funny I looked

2600
02:36:21,389 --> 02:36:22,270
when I was...

2601
02:36:22,270 --> 02:36:23,629
Had bad posture or something.

2602
02:36:23,629 --> 02:36:24,190
No.

2603
02:36:24,190 --> 02:36:27,250
I don't want to know.

2604
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:37,600
First wand of the evening.

2605
02:36:39,739 --> 02:36:40,299
And it is...

2606
02:36:42,899 --> 02:36:43,780
I mean, it's just...

2607
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:44,819
It's just fire shot.

2608
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:46,100
Fire shot.

2609
02:36:56,799 --> 02:36:58,860
Next wand is...

2610
02:36:58,860 --> 02:36:59,979
It's not a wand.

2611
02:36:59,979 --> 02:37:00,700
It's just water.

2612
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:01,020
Who cares?

2613
02:37:01,659 --> 02:37:09,299
I'm not clicking on that link.

2614
02:37:09,299 --> 02:37:10,100
I told you no distractions.

2615
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:11,620
This is a no distraction run.

2616
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:16,049
Playing as if my life depends on it.

2617
02:37:16,049 --> 02:37:23,870
I want that gold.

2618
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:24,430
I have...

2619
02:37:24,430 --> 02:37:25,389
I don't even know where it is.

2620
02:37:25,389 --> 02:37:25,790
Whatever.

2621
02:37:26,350 --> 02:37:29,409
Mr. Albertson, can I use the bathroom?

2622
02:37:29,409 --> 02:37:29,649
No.

2623
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:32,219
Not until after school.

2624
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:35,600
That's actually kind of...

2625
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:36,319
No, that's fucked up.

2626
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:37,920
No, you can go to the bathroom if you want.

2627
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,399
What is that?

2628
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,889
That's too long to wait.

2629
02:37:48,930 --> 02:37:50,049
Can I leave this, please?

2630
02:37:50,610 --> 02:37:54,719
I'm stuck.

2631
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:56,829
Snow potion.

2632
02:37:57,469 --> 02:37:59,680
Did that help?

2633
02:38:05,219 --> 02:38:06,180
Not really.

2634
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:10,610
All right, we're good.

2635
02:38:10,610 --> 02:38:12,930
I want to get in there.

2636
02:38:12,930 --> 02:38:20,700
Is that an up breaking?

2637
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:24,579
Peeing out viewers.

2638
02:38:24,579 --> 02:38:25,620
All right, fine.

2639
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:32,799
This looks good.

2640
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:35,200
Oh, what is this?

2641
02:38:36,399 --> 02:38:37,520
Slime ball.

2642
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:38,559
Poison to slime.

2643
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:42,510
This sucks.

2644
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:42,670
No.

2645
02:38:42,670 --> 02:38:43,309
Oh, wait. Wrong thing.

2646
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:46,500
Looks good.

2647
02:38:47,059 --> 02:38:49,010
This looks like it's gonna be pretty sick.

2648
02:38:50,770 --> 02:38:51,649
It's very slow.

2649
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:57,459
Why is he going so fast?

2650
02:38:58,180 --> 02:39:06,430
Mr. Albertson, can we do chat integration?

2651
02:39:06,430 --> 02:39:06,909
No, no.

2652
02:39:07,469 --> 02:39:13,170
What a shitty school this would be.

2653
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:17,379
You guys just watch the teacher play Noito?

2654
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:27,180
Mr. Albertson, when are we gonna actually do schoolwork?

2655
02:39:27,819 --> 02:39:28,299
I don't know.

2656
02:39:28,299 --> 02:39:28,620
Later.

2657
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:29,659
Shut up.

2658
02:39:29,659 --> 02:39:30,139
Leave me alone.

2659
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:32,110
This is the run.

2660
02:39:32,829 --> 02:39:46,879
Can I hit one of these guys and do...

2661
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:49,040
Any damage at all would be great.

2662
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:59,600
Mr. Albertson, can you help me with my homework?

2663
02:40:00,319 --> 02:40:03,360
Sure.

2664
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:03,920
Bring it here.

2665
02:40:04,479 --> 02:40:05,889
You need help with your homework?

2666
02:40:05,889 --> 02:40:06,530
Yeah, sure.

2667
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:07,010
Bring it here.

2668
02:40:07,010 --> 02:40:07,569
Let me see it.

2669
02:40:08,129 --> 02:40:08,959
What is that?

2670
02:40:08,959 --> 02:40:09,200
No.

2671
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:10,479
Oh, wow.

2672
02:40:10,479 --> 02:40:13,120
Yeah, it looks like you didn't fail out question three, four, and five.

2673
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:14,559
Let me help you with this.

2674
02:40:16,239 --> 02:40:19,170
Get the trash.

2675
02:40:19,729 --> 02:40:20,450
I gotta sit down.

2676
02:40:28,239 --> 02:40:29,680
Um, what am I?

2677
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:30,940
What do I do?

2678
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:33,409
What's happening?

2679
02:40:33,409 --> 02:40:35,409
What's wrong with me?

2680
02:40:35,409 --> 02:40:38,139
What's wrong with me?

2681
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:42,340
What do I do?

2682
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:42,819
Where am I?

2683
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,120
I stuck here forever?

2684
02:40:51,010 --> 02:40:53,409
Don't shoot yourself in the head with the...

2685
02:40:54,370 --> 02:41:01,250
Oh, it's unstable teleportaneum potion.

2686
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:03,940
Well, take it and drink it.

2687
02:41:03,940 --> 02:41:10,379
Okay, where...

2688
02:41:11,579 --> 02:41:19,860
It's got a thousand subs.

2689
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:20,100
What?

2690
02:41:23,489 --> 02:41:26,260
I just, like, choked on my own water in my mouth.

2691
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:35,040
Oh, shit.

2692
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:35,950
Get in there.

2693
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:40,500
I hate that feeling.

2694
02:41:41,299 --> 02:41:46,799
Is that not enough?

2695
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:47,920
Really?

2696
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:49,540
Hold on, I gotta...

2697
02:41:58,100 --> 02:41:58,739
Play the game?

2698
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:01,059
I am playing.

2699
02:42:01,059 --> 02:42:01,940
What are you talking about?

2700
02:42:02,739 --> 02:42:05,059
I'm currently, like, just playing the game.

2701
02:42:05,059 --> 02:42:16,850
Not fucking kill me, you fireball asshole.

2702
02:42:28,370 --> 02:42:36,829
Don't you die.

2703
02:42:37,790 --> 02:42:38,590
Oh, come on.

2704
02:42:39,389 --> 02:42:47,260
How many times do I have to hit you before you die?

2705
02:42:48,299 --> 02:42:52,290
Gowsum.

2706
02:42:54,270 --> 02:42:55,790
Snow and water potion combined.

2707
02:42:56,430 --> 02:42:57,579
That's a good idea.

2708
02:42:57,579 --> 02:42:58,860
Watch out, this guy's gonna throw a bomb.

2709
02:42:59,579 --> 02:43:13,069
I gotta...

2710
02:43:13,069 --> 02:43:14,690
I dropped a shitload of money too.

2711
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:17,819
What's happening?

2712
02:43:17,819 --> 02:43:18,540
I can't move.

2713
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:20,299
I just locked myself in the fire.

2714
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:22,909
Stop, please.

2715
02:43:23,469 --> 02:43:30,290
Quit pretending to play the game and play the game.

2716
02:43:32,350 --> 02:43:34,530
All right, let's make some spells.

2717
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:38,139
Splitter bolt with a timer.

2718
02:43:39,229 --> 02:43:40,350
Odd fireball.

2719
02:43:40,989 --> 02:43:42,110
Glitter bomb.

2720
02:43:42,110 --> 02:43:43,629
Firebolt with a trigger.

2721
02:43:43,629 --> 02:43:44,350
And chainsaw.

2722
02:43:46,299 --> 02:43:47,739
We have some wands to use here.

2723
02:43:49,139 --> 02:43:51,219
Get the chainsaw first and foremost.

2724
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:54,659
Let's get a firebolt with a trigger.

2725
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:56,479
Glitter bomb.

2726
02:43:58,110 --> 02:44:02,940
And split bolt.

2727
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:04,700
Time to make something happen here.

2728
02:44:04,700 --> 02:44:06,139
All right, this one is the...

2729
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:07,579
That one's good.

2730
02:44:08,299 --> 02:44:12,239
This is bomb, which kind of just sucks.

2731
02:44:13,379 --> 02:44:14,420
What does this have for?

2732
02:44:15,139 --> 02:44:16,930
Mana charge.

2733
02:44:17,489 --> 02:44:18,930
Max mana capacity one.

2734
02:44:21,069 --> 02:44:21,790
Cast delay.

2735
02:44:21,790 --> 02:44:22,750
It's very, very fast.

2736
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:31,229
That mana recharge though is really awful.

2737
02:44:31,229 --> 02:44:31,870
A glitter bomb.

2738
02:44:32,829 --> 02:44:34,059
Summons a bomb.

2739
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:44,610
And summon a bomb.

2740
02:44:46,159 --> 02:44:47,680
Okay, I'm gonna put a chainsaw here.

2741
02:44:48,639 --> 02:44:54,209
Yeah, there it is.

2742
02:44:54,930 --> 02:44:56,340
Now this one only...

2743
02:44:56,340 --> 02:44:57,139
This is a shuffle.

2744
02:44:57,700 --> 02:45:00,020
But what if we do...

2745
02:45:04,239 --> 02:45:05,600
Let's just fuck the whole thing up.

2746
02:45:06,639 --> 02:45:07,200
You know what I mean?

2747
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:12,829
This is gonna be a mystery wand.

2748
02:45:12,829 --> 02:45:15,149
Cast delay 0.3 seconds.

2749
02:45:16,030 --> 02:45:17,469
1.5 second charge time.

2750
02:45:17,469 --> 02:45:18,030
That's terrible.

2751
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:28,139
Shut this down.

2752
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:35,149
Please, never subbed.

2753
02:45:35,149 --> 02:45:36,030
Not donating.

2754
02:45:36,030 --> 02:45:37,309
Free entertainment.

2755
02:45:37,309 --> 02:45:38,110
That's fine.

2756
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:38,670
That's cool.

2757
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:39,069
I don't care.

2758
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:53,950
I think this is gonna be a super mystery wand.

2759
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:57,620
Like, what do I even care?

2760
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,500
I take this off though.

2761
02:45:59,299 --> 02:46:03,469
Groomer is an idiot.

2762
02:46:03,469 --> 02:46:03,969
Why?

2763
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:08,479
What are you guys doing?

2764
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,940
Will you guys settle down?

2765
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:11,979
What the fuck is happening?

2766
02:46:14,930 --> 02:46:17,409
Oh shit, that turns into like a million different bombs.

2767
02:46:17,969 --> 02:46:19,629
Okay, I like it.

2768
02:46:19,629 --> 02:46:30,299
All right, this is fine.

2769
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:38,829
Worm detractor?

2770
02:46:38,829 --> 02:46:41,170
I'm in a low capacity.

2771
02:46:41,170 --> 02:46:43,010
Or trick blood money.

2772
02:46:43,010 --> 02:46:46,030
Groomer's real name is Mitch.

2773
02:46:46,030 --> 02:46:46,670
It is not.

2774
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:48,190
It is not actually at all.

2775
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:59,250
All right, I'll integrate just after this.

2776
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:01,979
I'm gonna integrate just after this, okay?

2777
02:47:01,979 --> 02:47:04,340
You will get integrated.

2778
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:05,780
Somebody gave me $50.

2779
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:07,299
They gave me 5,000 bits.

2780
02:47:07,299 --> 02:47:09,700
That was goo berry juice thanks to the 50 bucks.

2781
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:10,979
That's a 5-0.

2782
02:47:10,979 --> 02:47:12,829
Hey Groomer, you're ugly.

2783
02:47:12,829 --> 02:47:21,340
Does the engineer dance from the popular multiplayer team base shooter Team Fortress 2?

2784
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:27,010
All right, how about high mana low capacity?

2785
02:47:27,010 --> 02:47:27,510
Let's go.

2786
02:47:28,049 --> 02:47:32,290
Your currently held wand loses half its capacity, but it gains more mana.

2787
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:34,209
Oh fuck, currently held wand.

2788
02:47:34,209 --> 02:47:55,620
Oh well, we're gonna be slime boys now.

2789
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:59,180
Put the other spell on it.

2790
02:47:59,180 --> 02:47:59,899
Oh wait a minute.

2791
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:01,500
It's not bad yet.

2792
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:02,379
We're fine.

2793
02:48:02,379 --> 02:48:13,250
Which one should I put on?

2794
02:48:13,250 --> 02:48:13,750
Chainsaw?

2795
02:48:23,389 --> 02:48:25,069
That's not even that bad.

2796
02:48:25,069 --> 02:48:30,299
No, wrong.

2797
02:48:30,299 --> 02:48:30,799
What?

2798
02:48:30,799 --> 02:48:35,600
Main job was good on bomb wand.

2799
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:38,239
Now that's good on here too.

2800
02:48:38,239 --> 02:48:39,459
Chainsaw is great for digging.

2801
02:48:39,459 --> 02:48:41,440
Yeah, that would be fine.

2802
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,360
This one I really fucked it up, but whatever.

2803
02:48:43,360 --> 02:48:45,979
I'm not supposed to do this now.

2804
02:48:45,979 --> 02:48:53,180
All right, we're gonna have to try to get good with the slime.

2805
02:48:53,180 --> 02:49:03,250
Build a statue.

2806
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:04,370
No, I know what happens when you do that.

2807
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:05,090
It's not good.

2808
02:49:05,090 --> 02:49:14,030
Currently...

2809
02:49:14,030 --> 02:49:19,139
Yeah, this is awesome actually.

2810
02:49:19,139 --> 02:49:23,600
I'm actually kind of glad I fucked that up because I can dig forever and not have to wait.

2811
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,700
This is good.

2812
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:26,000
This worked out pretty well.

2813
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,440
But we have to slime, which sucks.

2814
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:43,809
Let's dig down here.

2815
02:49:43,809 --> 02:49:46,799
Come on.

2816
02:49:46,799 --> 02:49:50,639
What did I hit?

2817
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:51,440
This chat.

2818
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:52,959
Look at this chat room right now.

2819
02:49:52,959 --> 02:49:55,170
It's fucked.

2820
02:49:55,170 --> 02:50:05,219
I want the gold here.

2821
02:50:05,299 --> 02:50:12,659
I'm just gonna dig and get all this gold.

2822
02:50:12,659 --> 02:50:13,139
Who cares?

2823
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:22,670
Toxicity is at a thousand percent.

2824
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:23,069
It is.

2825
02:50:23,069 --> 02:50:24,030
It's getting there.

2826
02:50:24,030 --> 02:50:28,270
Ooey gooey, ooey gooey, ooey gooey.

2827
02:50:30,799 --> 02:50:31,760
What have I done?

2828
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:33,360
I've created a monster.

2829
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:44,159
Don't they say that like the streamer's community is an offshoot kind of of the streamer's personality?

2830
02:50:44,159 --> 02:50:47,579
You guys are all in Arkham right now.

2831
02:50:47,579 --> 02:50:49,700
What have I done to you?

2832
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:58,459
Look at all this gold down here.

2833
02:50:58,459 --> 02:50:59,500
I can't ignore it.

2834
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:14,770
If you're good at something, never do it for free.

2835
02:51:14,770 --> 02:51:24,659
This is 2D Minecraft.

2836
02:51:24,659 --> 02:51:28,319
I don't even remotely accurate what you just said.

2837
02:51:28,399 --> 02:51:36,430
Don't you want me to get money?

2838
02:51:36,430 --> 02:51:36,750
Come on.

2839
02:51:36,750 --> 02:51:38,110
Don't you see the 69 number?

2840
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:38,829
That one's funny.

2841
02:51:38,829 --> 02:51:49,100
It's ooey gooey terraria.

2842
02:51:49,739 --> 02:51:52,059
You just said that in front of terraria.

2843
02:51:52,059 --> 02:52:05,120
That doesn't even make any sense.

2844
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:07,520
I really do want it, but let's go.

2845
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,659
Look at all this shit.

2846
02:52:10,299 --> 02:52:11,020
All right.

2847
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:13,340
We've got a pog one situation here.

2848
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:19,069
This is double spell, double glitter bomb.

2849
02:52:19,069 --> 02:52:31,139
Jumped over that.

2850
02:52:31,139 --> 02:52:40,719
It's actually not bad.

2851
02:52:40,719 --> 02:52:41,760
I actually like it.

2852
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:50,430
What's wrong with this person?

2853
02:52:50,430 --> 02:52:51,229
Uh, die?

2854
02:52:51,790 --> 02:52:54,239
Die?

2855
02:52:54,239 --> 02:52:55,700
Not gonna die.

2856
02:52:57,090 --> 02:52:57,889
Not going to die.

2857
02:52:58,450 --> 02:53:07,440
All right.

2858
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:09,200
Well, I'm just going to fucking destroy them.

2859
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:13,010
Does that look, huh?

2860
02:53:13,010 --> 02:53:13,649
Glitter bomb.

2861
02:53:14,610 --> 02:53:21,139
Max HP.

2862
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:22,020
Go.

2863
02:53:22,899 --> 02:53:26,129
What does this do?

2864
02:53:26,690 --> 02:53:27,889
Oh, it's a, it's a weird thing.

2865
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:33,979
Nice.

2866
02:53:33,979 --> 02:53:34,219
All right.

2867
02:53:34,219 --> 02:53:34,540
Money.

2868
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:35,579
Get money.

2869
02:53:35,579 --> 02:53:35,819
Quick.

2870
02:53:36,459 --> 02:53:37,440
All right.

2871
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:37,920
There's the end.

2872
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:38,239
We're good.

2873
02:53:38,239 --> 02:53:38,559
I'm fine.

2874
02:53:38,559 --> 02:53:38,799
Look it.

2875
02:53:38,799 --> 02:53:39,280
We're good.

2876
02:53:41,889 --> 02:53:43,489
Please ban everyone who's in chat.

2877
02:53:43,489 --> 02:53:43,969
All right.

2878
02:53:43,969 --> 02:53:45,489
Do a massive ban.

2879
02:53:49,659 --> 02:53:53,680
Glitter bombs kind of suck.

2880
02:53:54,479 --> 02:54:00,829
The blast radius is awful.

2881
02:54:00,829 --> 02:54:07,170
What's with this crap blast radius?

2882
02:54:07,889 --> 02:54:16,559
And I'm on fucking fire.

2883
02:54:16,559 --> 02:54:17,120
Of course I am.

2884
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:27,090
How do I even light on fire?

2885
02:54:27,090 --> 02:54:28,959
Can I not get through this?

2886
02:54:28,959 --> 02:54:29,520
Is it too tough?

2887
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:37,520
There we go.

2888
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:38,319
And there we are again.

2889
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:39,680
On fire.

2890
02:54:41,090 --> 02:54:43,569
Uh, if you see here, I'm still on fire.

2891
02:54:43,569 --> 02:54:48,450
I know this is a glitch with the demo I recorded, but still on fire.

2892
02:54:48,450 --> 02:54:52,799
So I backstabbed this guy.

2893
02:54:53,360 --> 02:55:02,100
Still on fire.

2894
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:02,340
Wow.

2895
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:06,739
We don't even, we don't even have any real true German 985 YouTube fans in here, do we?

2896
02:55:06,739 --> 02:55:13,700
The first video I ever made.

2897
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:14,180
Okay.

2898
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:25,629
Fine.

2899
02:55:25,629 --> 02:55:27,709
You know, sometimes I envy being in chat.

2900
02:55:27,709 --> 02:55:29,069
I do sometimes.

2901
02:55:29,069 --> 02:55:33,469
Because like, you could just write the most absolute fucking nonsense statement ever and

2902
02:55:33,469 --> 02:55:37,709
just sit there and laugh while maybe a handful of people like look at it and go,

2903
02:55:37,709 --> 02:55:39,309
what the fuck is that guy talking about?

2904
02:55:39,309 --> 02:55:40,590
Like, I kind of envy that in a way.

2905
02:55:40,590 --> 02:55:40,909
I do.

2906
02:55:44,659 --> 02:55:48,860
And I can't even read half the things that you guys say.

2907
02:55:48,860 --> 02:55:50,940
But I mean, it was just ridiculous.

2908
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:51,500
It was ridiculous.

2909
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:54,700
And you typed it, you press enter, and then you lean back in the chair and you left

2910
02:55:54,700 --> 02:55:58,219
because you knew that one or two people, including me, might see it and go,

2911
02:55:58,219 --> 02:55:59,659
this guy's fucking crazy.

2912
02:55:59,659 --> 02:56:03,620
This looks good.

2913
02:56:03,620 --> 02:56:04,120
Arrow.

2914
02:56:04,819 --> 02:56:05,780
Speed up.

2915
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:07,950
Triple spell.

2916
02:56:07,950 --> 02:56:09,469
360 mana.

2917
02:56:09,469 --> 02:56:22,290
Fast arrow.

2918
02:56:22,290 --> 02:56:28,530
This thing is galactically good.

2919
02:56:29,329 --> 02:56:30,850
Is that fire or is that honey?

2920
02:56:30,850 --> 02:56:36,299
What is this?

2921
02:56:36,299 --> 02:56:39,360
I can't pick this up?

2922
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:42,899
Protection from all.

2923
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:47,170
Oh, what?

2924
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:47,649
Okay.

2925
02:56:47,649 --> 02:56:48,290
All right, I gotta go.

2926
02:56:49,170 --> 02:56:50,290
I gotta get out of here.

2927
02:56:50,290 --> 02:56:52,420
I like the arrow though.

2928
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:53,780
We can make it something cool.

2929
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:57,569
With the blood.

2930
02:56:58,209 --> 02:57:08,020
Not into the, what?

2931
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:12,479
No, I'm just, I'm saying into this part.

2932
02:57:12,479 --> 02:57:12,979
200.

2933
02:57:13,600 --> 02:57:14,799
Finally, we get some wands.

2934
02:57:15,360 --> 02:57:19,440
Can afford, holy shit, that's a lot of slime.

2935
02:57:20,610 --> 02:57:22,850
Four spells cast per cast.

2936
02:57:22,850 --> 02:57:26,909
Four slimes.

2937
02:57:26,909 --> 02:57:28,670
This is four spells.

2938
02:57:28,670 --> 02:57:32,290
This is bouncy ball and fire.

2939
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:34,510
Can afford that one.

2940
02:57:34,510 --> 02:57:38,799
I can't afford this one, unfortunately, and I can not afford that one either.

2941
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:45,659
Burning trail, tons of bouncy balls.

2942
02:57:45,659 --> 02:57:47,420
That's probably, they'll just kill me.

2943
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:51,180
They're gonna bounce around everywhere and it's gonna light me on fire and I'm gonna die.

2944
02:57:51,739 --> 02:57:59,979
This one, on the other hand, is kind of could replace this one.

2945
02:57:59,979 --> 02:58:02,379
Four slimes at the same time.

2946
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:04,559
Better cast delay.

2947
02:58:06,850 --> 02:58:08,770
Slightly worse mana charge speed.

2948
02:58:09,409 --> 02:58:10,930
More maximum mana.

2949
02:58:10,930 --> 02:58:11,809
Extra capacity.

2950
02:58:15,010 --> 02:58:16,129
Yeah, let's go.

2951
02:58:17,950 --> 02:58:19,229
Four second recharge.

2952
02:58:19,229 --> 02:58:22,590
Yeah, but I shoot four at the same, yeah, it's a long time.

2953
02:58:22,590 --> 02:58:27,629
Get the bounce wand.

2954
02:58:27,629 --> 02:58:34,399
All right, I'm gonna replace bounce wand with, yeah, I get this thing.

2955
02:58:34,959 --> 02:58:41,649
I mean, this thing could be good if I could just fire a regular weapon.

2956
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:44,620
That cast delay is stupid.

2957
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:45,500
That's ridiculous.

2958
02:58:47,069 --> 02:58:49,229
Tiny recharge time, tiny cast time.

2959
02:58:49,229 --> 02:58:50,270
It's a spam gun.

2960
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:56,690
I could, should I put the saw on here?

2961
02:58:56,690 --> 02:59:01,489
Devon chat, Devon chat.

2962
02:59:01,489 --> 02:59:01,969
Really?

2963
02:59:01,969 --> 02:59:02,290
What's up?

2964
02:59:02,850 --> 02:59:09,889
Let me just, I wanna see something, hold on.

2965
02:59:09,889 --> 02:59:13,090
Spark bolt on this guy down here.

2966
02:59:13,090 --> 02:59:23,180
That's really, really good, but the, look at that, the recharge time is awful.

2967
02:59:24,430 --> 02:59:25,469
Yeah, that's why this thing sucks.

2968
02:59:26,270 --> 02:59:32,379
But no, wait, recharge time of point?

2969
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:33,819
Oh, that is bad.

2970
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:37,549
Yeah, this thing sucks.

2971
02:59:37,549 --> 02:59:38,190
Yeah, forget it.

2972
02:59:38,750 --> 02:59:40,190
I'm gonna get rid of this one.

2973
02:59:41,659 --> 02:59:44,620
I'll get the, I'll get the hell on earth wand.

2974
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:48,639
All right, I'm gonna get hell on earth.

2975
02:59:48,639 --> 02:59:52,290
Let's see what it does.

2976
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:54,030
Please don't kill me.

2977
02:59:55,069 --> 02:59:55,870
Yep, okay.

2978
02:59:55,870 --> 02:59:57,309
And this, you want me to use this wand?

2979
02:59:57,309 --> 02:59:58,190
This is the wand you want me to use?

2980
02:59:59,229 --> 03:00:01,069
This is, this is gonna be very bad.

2981
03:00:06,139 --> 03:00:07,340
I will try.

2982
03:00:07,340 --> 03:00:08,940
I have no guarantees though.

2983
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:10,139
All right, let's take a look at the other stuff.

2984
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:11,659
Okay, and saw's fine.

2985
03:00:12,219 --> 03:00:13,739
Can I make the arrows any better?

2986
03:00:13,739 --> 03:00:15,389
Triple speed up.

2987
03:00:15,950 --> 03:00:17,549
What about triple speed up?

2988
03:00:17,549 --> 03:00:21,520
Like, get rid of the arrows, just for a second.

2989
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:31,280
It doesn't hurt you, dummy.

2990
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:33,360
Oh, well, what about triple speed up this?

2991
03:00:34,079 --> 03:00:42,590
So what?

2992
03:00:42,590 --> 03:00:44,030
No, don't throw it on the ground.

2993
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:44,590
Go get that.

2994
03:00:45,309 --> 03:00:49,489
Projectile speed.

2995
03:00:52,110 --> 03:00:55,629
I just get rid of the triple spell and just do speed?

2996
03:00:55,629 --> 03:00:55,950
Hold on.

2997
03:00:56,590 --> 03:01:04,219
It's like, I can use it much more often, but hold on.

2998
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:13,409
Yeah, I can do it more often.

2999
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:18,959
There's never a slow down.

3000
03:01:18,959 --> 03:01:22,690
That's better.

3001
03:01:23,329 --> 03:01:28,079
It's brain.

3002
03:01:28,079 --> 03:01:30,909
Wait, is it shoot it?

3003
03:01:30,909 --> 03:01:31,549
Wait, what?

3004
03:01:31,549 --> 03:01:32,510
Oh, it's shuffle.

3005
03:01:32,510 --> 03:01:32,909
Whatever.

3006
03:01:32,909 --> 03:01:34,719
I got this wrong.

3007
03:01:46,299 --> 03:01:47,579
Remove speed.

3008
03:01:47,579 --> 03:02:01,600
I'll put speed back on.

3009
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:06,829
Welcome to the wand expo.

3010
03:02:06,829 --> 03:02:08,030
All right, I'm ready.

3011
03:02:09,950 --> 03:02:10,989
I'm going to change this, though.

3012
03:02:10,989 --> 03:02:12,510
Uh, wait, can I make this anything?

3013
03:02:13,149 --> 03:02:15,819
I want to make this better.

3014
03:02:15,819 --> 03:02:16,700
Slime sucks.

3015
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:17,819
I want to replace it with something else.

3016
03:02:19,709 --> 03:02:20,110
It sucks.

3017
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:20,909
It just does.

3018
03:02:20,909 --> 03:02:21,549
Let's be honest.

3019
03:02:21,549 --> 03:02:22,030
It sucks.

3020
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:26,049
Wand three should be in wand one.

3021
03:02:26,049 --> 03:02:26,770
Wand...

3022
03:02:26,770 --> 03:02:29,170
Yeah, these two, I'll switch back and forth.

3023
03:02:29,170 --> 03:02:32,940
And there's my chainsaw.

3024
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,239
Speed up the slime.

3025
03:02:40,209 --> 03:02:40,690
Yeah, but I...

3026
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:43,219
Slime sucks.

3027
03:02:43,219 --> 03:02:44,899
I'll replace it with something else later.

3028
03:02:44,899 --> 03:02:45,459
All right, let's go.

3029
03:02:46,340 --> 03:02:51,649
Get the spread off of wand four.

3030
03:02:51,649 --> 03:02:54,959
I kind of like it like this.

3031
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:58,620
Speed up the slime.

3032
03:02:58,860 --> 03:02:59,950
No.

3033
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:00,750
Speed up the slime.

3034
03:03:00,750 --> 03:03:01,709
Speed up the slime.

3035
03:03:01,709 --> 03:03:02,510
Speed up the slime.

3036
03:03:03,149 --> 03:03:12,719
I'll get...

3037
03:03:12,719 --> 03:03:13,280
No.

3038
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:13,520
No.

3039
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:15,899
It's awful.

3040
03:03:16,540 --> 03:03:26,930
Let's go.

3041
03:03:26,930 --> 03:03:28,370
Uh, worm attractor.

3042
03:03:28,370 --> 03:03:31,489
Kills to mana or explosion immunity.

3043
03:03:31,489 --> 03:03:32,690
I'll take it.

3044
03:03:32,690 --> 03:03:34,530
No direct damage from explosions ever again.

3045
03:03:35,329 --> 03:03:35,729
Don't...

3046
03:03:35,729 --> 03:03:36,450
Don't make the god mad.

3047
03:03:36,450 --> 03:03:37,170
Don't make god mad.

3048
03:03:37,170 --> 03:03:37,809
Don't make god mad.

3049
03:03:37,809 --> 03:03:38,610
Don't make god mad.

3050
03:03:38,610 --> 03:03:39,489
Don't make god mad.

3051
03:03:40,209 --> 03:03:41,299
Don't make god mad.

3052
03:03:41,299 --> 03:03:41,940
Put yourself out.

3053
03:03:42,659 --> 03:03:45,459
Oh, I made it.

3054
03:03:54,399 --> 03:03:54,799
Okay.

3055
03:03:55,520 --> 03:03:57,760
I think I'm gonna win this one.

3056
03:03:58,639 --> 03:04:08,590
I don't even know if I'm firing the weapon.

3057
03:04:11,809 --> 03:04:13,170
I need fire immunity.

3058
03:04:14,049 --> 03:04:14,850
And then I'm good.

3059
03:04:15,489 --> 03:04:23,489
I'm running out of oxygen.

3060
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:27,440
Why am I running out of oxygen?

3061
03:04:30,500 --> 03:04:30,739
All right.

3062
03:04:30,739 --> 03:04:33,139
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3063
03:04:33,139 --> 03:04:33,940
I don't even know where I am.

3064
03:04:34,819 --> 03:04:39,809
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

3065
03:04:44,239 --> 03:04:45,760
So don't do that.

3066
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:47,569
I don't want that one.

3067
03:04:47,569 --> 03:04:48,450
It's terrible.

3068
03:04:48,450 --> 03:04:52,420
Speed and a bunch of dynamite.

3069
03:04:52,420 --> 03:04:55,360
Who needs it?

3070
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:56,479
Actually, better than the slime.

3071
03:05:06,450 --> 03:05:08,049
I can't fire that once, man.

3072
03:05:08,690 --> 03:05:15,280
I guess I can fire that before I go into a new room.

3073
03:05:22,479 --> 03:05:23,680
I've already hurt myself.

3074
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:25,040
I've already taken tons of damage.

3075
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,639
It should have never happened.

3076
03:05:27,440 --> 03:05:35,569
You're gonna jump out and get me?

3077
03:05:36,290 --> 03:05:40,450
Really?

3078
03:05:40,450 --> 03:05:49,649
Well, now I am actually in trouble.

3079
03:05:50,370 --> 03:06:00,780
Truly in trouble now.

3080
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:05,280
I need something to save me here.

3081
03:06:05,280 --> 03:06:08,500
Fill up your glass with water.

3082
03:06:09,059 --> 03:06:09,540
Oh, shit.

3083
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:25,680
That person has a sniper rifle.

3084
03:06:26,319 --> 03:06:31,579
Oh, why?

3085
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:32,940
What?

3086
03:06:33,979 --> 03:06:34,530
All right.

3087
03:06:34,530 --> 03:06:34,930
You know what?

3088
03:06:34,930 --> 03:06:35,409
Fuck you.

3089
03:06:36,290 --> 03:06:45,780
Just crouch in the water.

3090
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:57,680
Fill this up.

3091
03:06:57,680 --> 03:07:03,139
What are these?

3092
03:07:03,139 --> 03:07:06,020
Teleport, titanium, levatium.

3093
03:07:06,739 --> 03:07:08,879
Wait, what is levatium?

3094
03:07:08,879 --> 03:07:13,709
Okay, that's pretty good.

3095
03:07:14,350 --> 03:07:16,319
Hover around more.

3096
03:07:16,319 --> 03:07:17,280
Oh, that's actually really nice.

3097
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:17,440
All right.

3098
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:18,319
Let's move.

3099
03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:24,239
I didn't think about it.

3100
03:07:27,709 --> 03:07:28,510
Go get crunk.

3101
03:07:30,049 --> 03:07:30,610
Crunk.

3102
03:07:30,610 --> 03:07:31,409
Follow the lever.

3103
03:07:31,409 --> 03:07:32,209
Go get crunk.

3104
03:07:32,209 --> 03:07:33,649
What are you talking about?

3105
03:07:34,450 --> 03:07:40,879
Sometimes I feel like you guys are a computer.

3106
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:57,149
Okay.

3107
03:07:57,149 --> 03:07:57,790
I'm still all right.

3108
03:07:57,790 --> 03:07:59,229
This is as far as I've ever been.

3109
03:07:59,229 --> 03:08:02,079
Almost just rolled that into me.

3110
03:08:02,079 --> 03:08:02,879
Almost.

3111
03:08:02,879 --> 03:08:03,440
I give you credit.

3112
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:03,840
You tried.

3113
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:22,799
Where am I going?

3114
03:08:22,799 --> 03:08:24,399
There's nothing here.

3115
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:30,659
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3116
03:08:31,219 --> 03:08:33,010
Isn't this progress?

3117
03:08:33,010 --> 03:08:33,729
What do you mean stop?

3118
03:08:34,290 --> 03:08:49,870
There's nothing even over here.

3119
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:58,319
Why would I go up when I need to go down?

3120
03:08:58,319 --> 03:08:59,440
I'm not going up.

3121
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:08,829
I need to go down.

3122
03:09:08,829 --> 03:09:12,420
You're a coward.

3123
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:12,899
Coward for what?

3124
03:09:12,899 --> 03:09:13,219
I don't know.

3125
03:09:13,219 --> 03:09:14,260
What do you mean I'm a coward?

3126
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:15,700
I want to go down, not up.

3127
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:27,659
Yeah, I died.

3128
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:30,510
The portal is down.

3129
03:09:31,069 --> 03:09:31,739
What?

3130
03:09:31,739 --> 03:09:33,979
Is there something bad up there that's going to kill me?

3131
03:09:33,979 --> 03:09:35,500
He's like this, like this, like this.

3132
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:35,739
Poison.

3133
03:09:35,739 --> 03:09:36,299
Drink the poison.

3134
03:09:36,299 --> 03:09:36,780
Drink the thing.

3135
03:09:37,659 --> 03:09:38,610
All right.

3136
03:09:38,610 --> 03:09:39,870
I'm good.

3137
03:09:39,870 --> 03:09:44,909
Drink.

3138
03:09:44,909 --> 03:09:46,590
You're a chicken boy.

3139
03:09:46,590 --> 03:09:48,979
We can all have our opinions.

3140
03:09:48,979 --> 03:09:49,379
It's fine.

3141
03:09:49,940 --> 03:09:55,200
I'm not messing around.

3142
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:56,159
I'm just going to start doing that.

3143
03:09:56,959 --> 03:09:57,840
Just getting out of the way.

3144
03:09:59,899 --> 03:10:06,510
There's something over there.

3145
03:10:07,149 --> 03:10:11,899
He's dead.

3146
03:10:12,620 --> 03:10:13,729
He's dead.

3147
03:10:14,290 --> 03:10:14,530
All right.

3148
03:10:14,530 --> 03:10:18,590
I think he's dead.

3149
03:10:19,149 --> 03:10:20,620
What is hurting me?

3150
03:10:22,610 --> 03:10:23,170
What hurt me?

3151
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:26,319
Somebody's flying.

3152
03:10:26,959 --> 03:10:29,120
Hold on.

3153
03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:29,600
What is that?

3154
03:10:30,959 --> 03:10:36,479
Is this good?

3155
03:10:38,940 --> 03:10:39,659
Acid ball.

3156
03:10:41,579 --> 03:10:44,059
Terrifying acidic projectile.

3157
03:10:44,059 --> 03:10:47,149
Increased mana.

3158
03:10:47,149 --> 03:10:57,540
I'll try it.

3159
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:02,340
Yes, I'm good.

3160
03:11:02,979 --> 03:11:04,590
Get me out.

3161
03:11:05,149 --> 03:11:06,340
Where this I've ever been.

3162
03:11:11,090 --> 03:11:12,370
There you go.

3163
03:11:12,370 --> 03:11:20,510
I don't have enough money to buy any of these besides this one.

3164
03:11:21,389 --> 03:11:23,059
But I don't really want it.

3165
03:11:23,059 --> 03:11:24,579
I think I'm just going to save my money.

3166
03:11:25,139 --> 03:11:28,879
Remove the fire from this.

3167
03:11:28,879 --> 03:11:31,360
Yeah, not a bad idea.

3168
03:11:32,319 --> 03:11:36,110
Yes, I took the fire off.

3169
03:11:36,110 --> 03:11:37,149
I took the fire off.

3170
03:11:37,149 --> 03:11:38,590
I took the fire off of that.

3171
03:11:38,590 --> 03:11:39,549
I took off the fire.

3172
03:11:39,549 --> 03:11:40,350
Why is it doing this?

3173
03:11:40,350 --> 03:11:40,989
What's down there?

3174
03:11:41,549 --> 03:11:42,110
What is that?

3175
03:11:43,579 --> 03:11:45,420
I can't fucking believe it, dude.

3176
03:11:45,420 --> 03:11:45,819
Why?

3177
03:11:45,819 --> 03:11:46,860
What is going on right now?

3178
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:48,139
I took the fire off.

3179
03:11:48,139 --> 03:11:52,670
Why is it still fire?

3180
03:11:57,780 --> 03:12:00,739
Always casts explosion.

3181
03:12:00,739 --> 03:12:12,799
Get rid of the spread.

3182
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:13,440
I'll be all right.

3183
03:12:15,010 --> 03:12:15,729
Okay.

3184
03:12:15,729 --> 03:12:17,459
This is what we take a look.

3185
03:12:17,459 --> 03:12:21,120
I can only afford this, but I don't think I want it.

3186
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:25,059
Do more balls.

3187
03:12:25,059 --> 03:12:26,420
I wish I had more balls.

3188
03:12:27,059 --> 03:12:28,479
I could do one, two, three, four,

3189
03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:30,879
but then I could do something else, too.

3190
03:12:30,879 --> 03:12:32,159
I could do three spark bolts.

3191
03:12:35,409 --> 03:12:36,209
Shoot four at once.

3192
03:12:36,209 --> 03:12:37,090
You don't need the spread.

3193
03:12:37,090 --> 03:12:37,590
Hold on.

3194
03:12:38,290 --> 03:12:42,159
Oops.

3195
03:12:42,780 --> 03:12:51,950
So then why don't I do those four,

3196
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:54,430
and then spark bolt as well?

3197
03:12:55,069 --> 03:13:01,149
Does it even matter?

3198
03:13:01,149 --> 03:13:01,790
No.

3199
03:13:01,790 --> 03:13:05,790
All right.

3200
03:13:05,790 --> 03:13:06,750
How do I get down there?

3201
03:13:06,750 --> 03:13:07,709
Do you see that thing down there?

3202
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:12,159
I got to pee really bad.

3203
03:13:12,799 --> 03:13:13,280
I got to pee.

3204
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:14,239
I'll be right back.

3205
03:13:14,239 --> 03:16:10,530
Hey, what's up?

3206
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:21,229
More money came in.

3207
03:16:21,229 --> 03:16:23,229
More $50 donations came in.

3208
03:16:23,229 --> 03:16:27,950
Two of them.

3209
03:16:27,950 --> 03:16:29,549
Five thousand.

3210
03:16:29,549 --> 03:16:30,190
We can't hear you?

3211
03:16:30,190 --> 03:16:30,829
You can.

3212
03:16:30,829 --> 03:16:32,500
Hold on.

3213
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:39,260
I'm going to burp.

3214
03:16:39,260 --> 03:16:41,739
There was five thousand bits from the Beer Hunter.

3215
03:16:41,739 --> 03:16:42,700
Thank you, Beer Hunter.

3216
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:46,930
Remember, my new schedule of work has basically prevented me

3217
03:16:46,930 --> 03:16:48,930
from watching you stream for several months.

3218
03:16:51,100 --> 03:16:52,299
I miss you.

3219
03:16:52,299 --> 03:16:53,899
And since I got the chance to catch a stream,

3220
03:16:53,899 --> 03:16:56,139
I thought I would pop in and say hi.

3221
03:16:56,139 --> 03:16:58,829
But we've all missed you, too.

3222
03:16:58,829 --> 03:16:59,709
What the?

3223
03:16:59,709 --> 03:17:00,909
I was supposed to say what the fuck,

3224
03:17:00,909 --> 03:17:03,389
but you got like a new work schedule.

3225
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:11,579
I was going to jokingly say,

3226
03:17:11,579 --> 03:17:13,260
seriously, thank you for the huge amount of money,

3227
03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:14,139
and welcome back.

3228
03:17:14,139 --> 03:17:15,809
You can catch a stream.

3229
03:17:15,809 --> 03:17:16,129
You can.

3230
03:17:16,129 --> 03:17:17,329
If you can't, you can't.

3231
03:17:17,329 --> 03:17:18,370
It's all good.

3232
03:17:18,370 --> 03:17:22,819
Thanks for the huge drop of money.

3233
03:17:22,819 --> 03:17:25,379
And then speaking of another huge drop of money,

3234
03:17:25,379 --> 03:17:31,469
thank you to Spike Sensei for the five thousand bits.

3235
03:17:31,469 --> 03:17:32,270
Aloha, Jerma.

3236
03:17:32,270 --> 03:17:33,790
This is my first time ever donating.

3237
03:17:33,790 --> 03:17:36,190
Sorry for leeching free content this whole time.

3238
03:17:36,190 --> 03:17:38,110
Hope you have a good night and the rest of your stream.

3239
03:17:38,110 --> 03:17:41,440
It's not, you're not leeching free con-

3240
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:43,600
But by its very design, this stream is free.

3241
03:17:47,739 --> 03:17:52,719
Leeching.

3242
03:17:52,719 --> 03:17:54,899
Thanks for the 50 bucks.

3243
03:17:54,899 --> 03:17:55,540
You're not a-

3244
03:17:55,540 --> 03:18:00,100
You never were a leech.

3245
03:18:00,100 --> 03:18:01,700
Oh, nice Powerade.

3246
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:03,069
I love Powerade.

3247
03:18:03,069 --> 03:18:05,790
I really do.

3248
03:18:05,790 --> 03:18:07,389
I don't even care if you're not supposed to drink it.

3249
03:18:07,389 --> 03:18:09,170
Unless you're like working out and I give a shit.

3250
03:18:09,170 --> 03:18:09,889
I love it.

3251
03:18:09,889 --> 03:18:22,100
All right, let's go.

3252
03:18:22,100 --> 03:18:24,500
Swado advertisement joke needs to stop.

3253
03:18:24,500 --> 03:18:26,100
I love Powerade.

3254
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:27,870
I love McDonald's.

3255
03:18:27,870 --> 03:18:29,950
I love Powerade and I love McDonald's.

3256
03:18:29,950 --> 03:18:32,000
What do you want me to do?

3257
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:33,280
Lie to you and say that I don't like it?

3258
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:36,719
Glass Cannon.

3259
03:18:37,979 --> 03:18:39,100
Oil Blood.

3260
03:18:39,100 --> 03:18:40,940
Or Angry Ghost.

3261
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:49,549
I could re-roll it.

3262
03:18:49,549 --> 03:18:54,209
True.

3263
03:18:54,209 --> 03:18:54,930
Angry Ghost.

3264
03:18:58,590 --> 03:18:59,790
What color of Powerade?

3265
03:18:59,790 --> 03:19:00,909
Purple Powerade's the best.

3266
03:19:00,909 --> 03:19:01,950
Blue Powerade's okay.

3267
03:19:02,909 --> 03:19:05,309
Red Powerade is third place, I think.

3268
03:19:05,309 --> 03:19:07,870
And Orange Powerade and Orange Gatorade

3269
03:19:07,870 --> 03:19:09,469
taste like stomach acid or throw up.

3270
03:19:09,469 --> 03:19:10,430
I don't like either one of them.

3271
03:19:10,430 --> 03:19:17,700
Let's do Angry Ghost.

3272
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:19,059
An angry spirit comes to your aid

3273
03:19:19,059 --> 03:19:20,899
copying nearby spells and projections.

3274
03:19:20,899 --> 03:19:21,540
Really?

3275
03:19:21,540 --> 03:19:25,979
I don't see you copying anything.

3276
03:19:25,979 --> 03:19:29,700
Oh, anger the god.

3277
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:30,180
Go.

3278
03:19:30,180 --> 03:19:38,420
Doesn't look that angry.

3279
03:19:38,420 --> 03:19:39,379
No, not really.

3280
03:19:39,379 --> 03:19:42,850
Orange Gatorade made me throw up one.

3281
03:19:42,850 --> 03:19:43,969
Yeah, it sucks.

3282
03:19:43,969 --> 03:19:45,729
I don't understand why they-

3283
03:19:45,729 --> 03:19:47,170
I don't know why they still make it.

3284
03:19:47,170 --> 03:19:48,930
I have no idea why they make it still.

3285
03:19:48,930 --> 03:19:49,489
Nobody drinks it.

3286
03:19:49,489 --> 03:19:49,969
It's horrible.

3287
03:19:59,229 --> 03:19:59,950
Ah, ah!

3288
03:20:00,770 --> 03:20:01,090
Move!

3289
03:20:01,889 --> 03:20:03,979
Why can I-

3290
03:20:03,979 --> 03:20:04,620
Please move.

3291
03:20:04,620 --> 03:20:05,420
Please move.

3292
03:20:05,420 --> 03:20:06,219
Please?

3293
03:20:06,219 --> 03:20:06,780
Please move?

3294
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:13,010
What the fuck?

3295
03:20:13,010 --> 03:20:13,729
Dude, all right.

3296
03:20:14,290 --> 03:20:16,129
I've had enough of this shit.

3297
03:20:17,409 --> 03:20:20,340
Did I just get hit in the face by my own thing?

3298
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:21,139
What the fuck?

3299
03:20:21,139 --> 03:20:21,540
Why would-

3300
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:23,379
Why am I stuck in the pixel?

3301
03:20:23,379 --> 03:20:24,899
That's very angry inducing.

3302
03:20:25,790 --> 03:20:26,270
I can't-

3303
03:20:26,270 --> 03:20:27,389
I can't even move.

3304
03:20:28,270 --> 03:20:30,350
I get stuck in, like, the pixel shit.

3305
03:20:30,909 --> 03:20:36,930
Oh god, I'm dead.

3306
03:20:37,649 --> 03:20:47,979
What's there to shoot?

3307
03:20:55,309 --> 03:20:56,909
Sniped point blank.

3308
03:20:56,909 --> 03:20:59,389
No, but right here I got, like, fucking latched on

3309
03:20:59,389 --> 03:21:01,549
and they're all just aiming at me and firing at me.

3310
03:21:02,270 --> 03:21:13,229
This hissy base is a madhouse.

3311
03:21:13,229 --> 03:21:14,190
Oh, I'm dead.

3312
03:21:14,190 --> 03:21:15,549
I just, like, I just died.

3313
03:21:15,549 --> 03:21:16,030
I'm dead.

3314
03:21:16,030 --> 03:21:16,989
All right, fun.

3315
03:21:16,989 --> 03:21:17,709
Right, really fun.

3316
03:21:17,709 --> 03:21:19,709
In the first five seconds of the map, I'm dead.

3317
03:21:20,510 --> 03:21:21,549
What is this-

3318
03:21:21,549 --> 03:21:23,149
What is this bullshit down here?

3319
03:21:23,149 --> 03:21:23,870
Like, I'm just-

3320
03:21:23,870 --> 03:21:25,229
I'm just dead immediately.

3321
03:21:25,950 --> 03:21:32,260
You get, like, stuck in the quicksand.

3322
03:21:32,979 --> 03:21:35,680
I'm turning on integration.

3323
03:21:36,399 --> 03:21:37,120
This is stupid.

3324
03:21:37,840 --> 03:21:51,459
All right, let me turn on streamer mode.

3325
03:21:51,459 --> 03:21:52,579
I don't want to leak anything.

3326
03:21:52,579 --> 03:21:54,020
Is this going to leak something?

3327
03:21:54,020 --> 03:22:00,940
Streaming.

3328
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:04,000
Okay, here we go.

3329
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:10,190
Okay, we're apparently connected.

3330
03:22:10,750 --> 03:22:13,760
I guess.

3331
03:22:14,559 --> 03:22:17,100
I guess the chat is connected somehow.

3332
03:22:17,739 --> 03:22:23,229
What does that mean?

3333
03:22:24,030 --> 03:22:26,350
Let stream viewers interact with your game through the Twitch chat.

3334
03:22:26,350 --> 03:22:28,340
Okay, did it work?

3335
03:22:28,979 --> 03:22:34,799
Next vote in 16 seconds.

3336
03:22:34,799 --> 03:22:41,569
What are you voting for?

3337
03:22:46,559 --> 03:22:49,040
Social security just got DM'd to me.

3338
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:57,340
Voting ends.

3339
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:57,979
New one.

3340
03:22:57,979 --> 03:22:59,340
Wait, is this going to just give it to me?

3341
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:01,379
This just gives me shit?

3342
03:23:01,379 --> 03:23:03,700
I told you the chat was going to be a mess when we turn this on.

3343
03:23:04,260 --> 03:23:11,729
Give me a-

3344
03:23:12,450 --> 03:23:12,690
Give-

3345
03:23:12,690 --> 03:23:14,450
Oh, yeah, remove the ground.

3346
03:23:14,450 --> 03:23:15,809
Sure, that one will be fun.

3347
03:23:16,370 --> 03:23:23,700
What does that even do?

3348
03:23:27,700 --> 03:23:28,899
Okay, I guess it removes the-

3349
03:23:28,899 --> 03:23:30,770
Oh, it's this one.

3350
03:23:30,770 --> 03:23:31,729
Circle of thunder.

3351
03:23:33,010 --> 03:23:44,989
All right, I want to go down.

3352
03:23:44,989 --> 03:23:47,149
Can't fucking believe I just did that.

3353
03:23:47,709 --> 03:23:50,750
What the fuck did I do that for?

3354
03:23:51,549 --> 03:23:53,069
I just was trying to rush.

3355
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:57,760
All nearby ground disappears.

3356
03:23:57,760 --> 03:24:00,659
Well, that ain't gonna-

3357
03:24:00,659 --> 03:24:01,940
Thank you, you just saved my life.

3358
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:03,059
Thanks, guys.

3359
03:24:03,700 --> 03:24:04,829
I appreciate that.

3360
03:24:04,829 --> 03:24:06,110
You literally just saved me from dying.

3361
03:24:17,620 --> 03:24:19,379
Too many things to keep track of.

3362
03:24:26,239 --> 03:24:27,520
How do I remove fire from the game?

3363
03:24:28,079 --> 03:24:29,040
Hey, next time you can vote.

3364
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:31,360
Vote on take fire out of the game.

3365
03:24:36,989 --> 03:24:37,549
All the gold?

3366
03:24:37,549 --> 03:24:38,989
Yeah, I can't go there because I'm going to burn.

3367
03:24:51,459 --> 03:24:53,700
Nothing do I hate more than getting stuck in video games.

3368
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:54,979
Like getting stuck on shit.

3369
03:24:54,979 --> 03:24:57,379
Nothing pisses me off more than getting stuck.

3370
03:24:58,530 --> 03:25:01,569
Like, nothing more.

3371
03:25:01,569 --> 03:25:02,290
Nothing more than that.

3372
03:25:03,090 --> 03:25:17,889
I'm already fucking dead.

3373
03:25:17,889 --> 03:25:19,409
Just reset it, reset it, reset it.

3374
03:25:19,409 --> 03:25:20,530
Reset it, kill me.

3375
03:25:20,530 --> 03:25:20,930
I don't-

3376
03:25:20,930 --> 03:25:21,969
Reset it.

3377
03:25:21,969 --> 03:25:30,750
It's anger inducing, huh?

3378
03:25:30,750 --> 03:25:31,549
It is.

3379
03:25:31,549 --> 03:25:32,030
I agree.

3380
03:25:32,030 --> 03:25:33,950
Oh, I'm changing some of these things up a little.

3381
03:25:33,950 --> 03:25:37,860
Now I know why everyone said this is a rage game.

3382
03:25:37,860 --> 03:25:39,059
I didn't believe you until-

3383
03:25:39,059 --> 03:25:42,739
Until I got to that temple and got stuck in the ground and died.

3384
03:25:42,739 --> 03:25:45,579
I don't want you guys to see this.

3385
03:25:45,579 --> 03:25:47,020
So your time between votes.

3386
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:48,059
How about what?

3387
03:25:48,059 --> 03:25:52,670
60 seconds?

3388
03:25:52,670 --> 03:25:53,709
Voting time.

3389
03:25:53,709 --> 03:25:54,350
30 seconds?

3390
03:26:00,719 --> 03:26:01,219
Okay.

3391
03:26:02,479 --> 03:26:03,680
Hide the vote count.

3392
03:26:03,680 --> 03:26:04,159
Yep.

3393
03:26:04,159 --> 03:26:07,489
I don't want you guys to see that.

3394
03:26:10,850 --> 03:26:13,090
Tiny ghosts can be named after viewers, sure.

3395
03:26:13,090 --> 03:26:13,889
Yeah, that sounds good.

3396
03:26:13,889 --> 03:26:22,340
All right, that's good.

3397
03:26:22,340 --> 03:26:23,940
All right, I'm going to try as hard as I can now.

3398
03:26:24,579 --> 03:26:25,299
Here we go.

3399
03:26:25,299 --> 03:26:27,379
Actually, this one's going to be the fucking run.

3400
03:26:27,379 --> 03:26:30,020
No more getting stuck on tiny sand pixels.

3401
03:26:36,860 --> 03:26:41,200
Okay, enter the mines.

3402
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:48,319
What did you just do to me?

3403
03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:49,040
Did you just headbump me?

3404
03:26:49,840 --> 03:26:55,540
I got that money.

3405
03:26:55,540 --> 03:27:02,930
Oh shit, I can't even see what it is either, can I?

3406
03:27:02,930 --> 03:27:04,260
No, I can't.

3407
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:04,979
Sea of lava.

3408
03:27:04,979 --> 03:27:06,659
A huge body of lava is summoned.

3409
03:27:08,260 --> 03:27:11,709
Where?

3410
03:27:11,709 --> 03:27:12,270
Right there.

3411
03:27:12,270 --> 03:27:12,770
Okay.

3412
03:27:17,649 --> 03:27:18,209
You know what?

3413
03:27:18,209 --> 03:27:21,409
I actually don't like the fact that I don't know what you guys are doing.

3414
03:27:21,969 --> 03:27:24,159
Because it's a mystery to me too.

3415
03:27:24,959 --> 03:27:25,680
I don't like that.

3416
03:27:37,459 --> 03:27:38,739
What's- what is this?

3417
03:27:38,739 --> 03:27:39,379
It's dynamite.

3418
03:27:39,379 --> 03:27:40,340
All right, let's dynamite over there.

3419
03:27:40,340 --> 03:27:40,840
Let's go.

3420
03:27:50,739 --> 03:27:51,459
How much mana?

3421
03:27:51,459 --> 03:27:52,100
This thing sucks.

3422
03:27:52,979 --> 03:27:57,600
Come here, cannibal.

3423
03:27:58,159 --> 03:27:59,540
Come here.

3424
03:28:00,159 --> 03:28:00,659
Come here.

3425
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:03,440
Come here.

3426
03:28:03,440 --> 03:28:04,479
Come here, coward.

3427
03:28:04,479 --> 03:28:04,879
Come here.

3428
03:28:04,879 --> 03:28:05,600
He flipped me off.

3429
03:28:06,319 --> 03:28:12,079
Oh, give me that.

3430
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:17,379
Oh, it's poison.

3431
03:28:17,940 --> 03:28:21,579
I can't even get in there anymore.

3432
03:28:21,579 --> 03:28:23,020
Shit, I want- whatever that-

3433
03:28:23,020 --> 03:28:23,579
Give it to me.

3434
03:28:24,989 --> 03:28:25,790
Drain the poison.

3435
03:28:27,899 --> 03:28:28,780
Drain the poison.

3436
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:37,920
One of those fire assholes is right there too.

3437
03:28:38,719 --> 03:28:41,059
They got saw blades everywhere.

3438
03:28:41,059 --> 03:28:43,620
For a time, all projectiles become giant saw blades.

3439
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:45,760
All-

3440
03:28:50,879 --> 03:28:51,379
Okay.

3441
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:57,059
Oh my god, that did so much damage to me.

3442
03:28:58,510 --> 03:28:59,950
That was so bad.

3443
03:29:02,239 --> 03:29:02,879
What happened to me?

3444
03:29:02,879 --> 03:29:03,760
I turned into a snail.

3445
03:29:04,639 --> 03:29:08,450
Did you guys do this?

3446
03:29:09,729 --> 03:29:15,649
Oh, that's good.

3447
03:29:16,450 --> 03:29:20,079
Oh, right, things are saw blades.

3448
03:29:20,719 --> 03:29:22,000
Is it still saw blades?

3449
03:29:22,719 --> 03:29:23,219
Jesus.

3450
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:32,700
And I got hurt.

3451
03:29:33,739 --> 03:29:35,340
Delete poison and fire from the game.

3452
03:29:35,899 --> 03:29:38,750
Oh, I'm dead.

3453
03:29:42,659 --> 03:29:43,540
I get touched once.

3454
03:29:43,540 --> 03:29:44,420
I'm fucking dead.

3455
03:29:45,139 --> 03:29:47,950
Do three.

3456
03:29:47,950 --> 03:29:48,670
Do three.

3457
03:29:48,670 --> 03:29:49,309
Do three.

3458
03:29:49,309 --> 03:29:49,709
Do three.

3459
03:29:49,709 --> 03:29:50,270
Everybody do three.

3460
03:29:52,079 --> 03:29:53,760
Oh, that was ugly.

3461
03:29:53,760 --> 03:29:59,379
I can't even do it, man.

3462
03:30:00,260 --> 03:30:02,260
That shit does 75 damage.

3463
03:30:03,379 --> 03:30:04,739
I was fucking merked.

3464
03:30:05,379 --> 03:30:22,780
I feel like this is-

3465
03:30:22,780 --> 03:30:23,420
I'm- you know what?

3466
03:30:23,420 --> 03:30:28,219
I'm so glad that I did not turn this on until, like, playing for a little while.

3467
03:30:28,219 --> 03:30:34,829
If I had done this from the second I turned the stream on,

3468
03:30:34,829 --> 03:30:36,030
I would not have thought the game was fun.

3469
03:30:36,030 --> 03:30:38,110
I would have been like, oh, that was cool for a little bit, I guess.

3470
03:30:38,110 --> 03:30:39,629
No, let's move the fuck on.

3471
03:30:39,629 --> 03:30:51,260
This is stupid.

3472
03:30:51,260 --> 03:30:52,459
Now there's no going back, right?

3473
03:30:52,780 --> 03:30:56,350
There's not a scenario now on stream where I turn this off.

3474
03:30:56,909 --> 03:30:57,969
You all know it.

3475
03:30:58,690 --> 03:31:09,340
Alcohol trail.

3476
03:31:09,340 --> 03:31:11,340
Your projectiles leave a trail of alcohol.

3477
03:31:11,340 --> 03:31:11,840
Wait.

3478
03:31:15,280 --> 03:31:16,239
What the fuck is going on?

3479
03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:19,219
Well, that's an acid potion.

3480
03:31:19,219 --> 03:31:20,659
Just start it over again.

3481
03:31:20,659 --> 03:31:21,459
Start it over again.

3482
03:31:21,459 --> 03:31:22,100
Just start over.

3483
03:31:22,100 --> 03:31:22,979
I- start it over.

3484
03:31:23,620 --> 03:31:35,579
You didn't check your equipment, you nerd.

3485
03:31:38,540 --> 03:31:39,819
Okay, here's water.

3486
03:31:39,819 --> 03:31:40,780
It's not acid.

3487
03:31:41,500 --> 03:31:45,680
Can I get down to at least the second floor, please?

3488
03:31:46,319 --> 03:31:54,399
There's so many potions in the game.

3489
03:31:54,399 --> 03:31:56,559
I didn't know acid was a possibility.

3490
03:32:20,340 --> 03:32:20,819
Jump.

3491
03:32:20,819 --> 03:32:21,319
Jump.

3492
03:32:22,379 --> 03:32:22,879
Jump.

3493
03:32:25,840 --> 03:32:26,719
Shower.

3494
03:32:26,719 --> 03:32:28,319
A rain cloud spawns on you.

3495
03:32:28,319 --> 03:32:28,959
Oh, cool.

3496
03:32:28,959 --> 03:32:29,760
Thanks.

3497
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:30,559
That'll help with the fire.

3498
03:32:34,610 --> 03:32:36,770
Actually, very good thing for you to do.

3499
03:32:36,770 --> 03:32:46,620
It looks like a big one down there.

3500
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:54,590
Burn him.

3501
03:32:54,590 --> 03:32:57,010
All right.

3502
03:32:57,010 --> 03:32:58,209
I got the cloud still, right?

3503
03:32:58,209 --> 03:32:58,930
How long does it last?

3504
03:32:59,809 --> 03:33:00,770
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

3505
03:33:04,639 --> 03:33:05,360
It's just a torch.

3506
03:33:07,250 --> 03:33:08,129
Just a torch.

3507
03:33:08,850 --> 03:33:12,139
That looks really cool for just what is essentially a nerf gun.

3508
03:33:27,219 --> 03:33:27,860
Sing the raid song?

3509
03:33:28,979 --> 03:33:30,180
Oh, there's a raid.

3510
03:33:30,180 --> 03:33:33,469
All right, I'll sing the raid.

3511
03:33:38,430 --> 03:33:39,629
Thank you for the raid.

3512
03:33:39,629 --> 03:33:41,069
Really appreciate it.

3513
03:33:41,069 --> 03:33:44,399
I am so happy.

3514
03:33:44,399 --> 03:33:44,959
Thanks.

3515
03:33:44,959 --> 03:33:46,590
Who was it?

3516
03:33:46,590 --> 03:33:47,870
Busty Lugs VR.

3517
03:33:48,430 --> 03:33:55,170
I think that's a VR streamer.

3518
03:33:55,170 --> 03:33:56,370
Thanks a lot.

3519
03:33:56,370 --> 03:33:56,690
Welcome.

3520
03:33:56,690 --> 03:33:57,489
Hope you had a good stream.

3521
03:33:57,489 --> 03:33:58,049
Welcome, everybody.

3522
03:33:58,049 --> 03:34:00,049
We're playing Noito with Twitch integration.

3523
03:34:00,049 --> 03:34:00,690
It's pretty cool.

3524
03:34:00,690 --> 03:34:01,170
Pretty fun.

3525
03:34:02,209 --> 03:34:04,479
That was sad, wasn't it?

3526
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:09,120
I turned on the auto-tune and just started making horrible noises.

3527
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:10,319
I hope it was painful.

3528
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:16,979
Oh, you guys just did the Yoshi's Island thing to me.

3529
03:34:17,620 --> 03:34:18,420
This is not that bad.

3530
03:34:19,059 --> 03:34:20,100
Now, that's good.

3531
03:34:21,809 --> 03:34:22,370
Yep.

3532
03:34:22,370 --> 03:34:23,729
All right, this just saved the run here.

3533
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:37,819
There's a song that goes with this, too, isn't it?

3534
03:34:38,459 --> 03:34:39,969
Yeah, it's like...

3535
03:34:49,500 --> 03:34:50,700
That's Angry Beavers, never mind.

3536
03:34:51,420 --> 03:35:07,520
I forgot about that show.

3537
03:35:07,520 --> 03:35:10,450
All right, now when I turn the stream off,

3538
03:35:10,450 --> 03:35:15,659
I am going to watch like four episodes in a row of Angry Beavers.

3539
03:35:19,299 --> 03:35:19,780
Oh, you...

3540
03:35:20,420 --> 03:35:21,139
Copy, Beaver.

3541
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:25,500
Finally made it to the bottom.

3542
03:35:25,500 --> 03:35:26,059
Can you believe it?

3543
03:35:26,620 --> 03:35:29,329
All right, I'm going to wait for this.

3544
03:35:29,329 --> 03:35:29,809
What is this?

3545
03:35:29,809 --> 03:35:32,290
Loot, treasure, rain, glisten, and health plus.

3546
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:33,809
All right, give me something good.

3547
03:35:34,370 --> 03:35:39,299
Treasure, rain.

3548
03:35:40,639 --> 03:35:40,959
Yes!

3549
03:35:41,920 --> 03:35:42,399
Holy...

3550
03:35:42,399 --> 03:35:42,639
Wait.

3551
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:44,479
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3552
03:35:44,479 --> 03:35:45,920
I can't walk over there.

3553
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:47,200
I can't walk over there.

3554
03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:47,760
It's going to stop it.

3555
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:49,760
Why did I stand here?

3556
03:35:49,760 --> 03:35:52,860
No, I can get it.

3557
03:35:53,579 --> 03:35:56,829
Oh, it disappeared.

3558
03:35:56,829 --> 03:35:57,469
I got it.

3559
03:35:57,469 --> 03:35:58,030
Thanks, guys.

3560
03:35:58,590 --> 03:35:59,790
Thanks for the treasure.

3561
03:35:59,790 --> 03:36:06,100
Nobody just gave a lot of bits.

3562
03:36:06,180 --> 03:36:06,420
Yeah.

3563
03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:12,239
400.

3564
03:36:12,239 --> 03:36:13,680
I can afford whatever I want now.

3565
03:36:16,610 --> 03:36:17,969
Double spell, double spell.

3566
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:20,159
Slimeball light.

3567
03:36:20,799 --> 03:36:22,930
It's kind of expensive.

3568
03:36:25,549 --> 03:36:25,870
Spells.

3569
03:36:25,870 --> 03:36:26,590
It only shoots one.

3570
03:36:27,149 --> 03:36:28,899
Energy sphere.

3571
03:36:28,899 --> 03:36:34,319
This was like four or five.

3572
03:36:34,319 --> 03:36:39,280
It's not bad.

3573
03:36:41,180 --> 03:36:41,579
Max mana.

3574
03:36:41,579 --> 03:36:43,180
How much is the mana to shoot this mana?

3575
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:43,500
20.

3576
03:36:44,139 --> 03:36:46,690
That's not bad.

3577
03:36:47,250 --> 03:36:47,809
Could be worse.

3578
03:36:48,450 --> 03:36:52,620
Ooh, spitter bolt.

3579
03:36:53,629 --> 03:36:56,420
700 mana.

3580
03:36:56,420 --> 03:36:58,979
Dogshit recharge.

3581
03:36:58,979 --> 03:37:07,139
But, hmm, what about this one?

3582
03:37:07,139 --> 03:37:09,219
Giga disk projectile.

3583
03:37:17,180 --> 03:37:19,920
I kind of like this one.

3584
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:25,340
Teleport bolt.

3585
03:37:25,340 --> 03:37:26,860
Magical bolt that moves you wherever it ends up.

3586
03:37:26,860 --> 03:37:28,139
No, don't want that.

3587
03:37:28,139 --> 03:37:33,950
All right, I'll take the Giga one.

3588
03:37:33,950 --> 03:37:34,670
Go.

3589
03:37:34,670 --> 03:37:42,190
Did they hit me?

3590
03:37:42,190 --> 03:37:43,229
Can they hit me?

3591
03:37:43,229 --> 03:37:46,540
Can these hit me?

3592
03:37:47,100 --> 03:37:50,420
Okay.

3593
03:37:50,420 --> 03:37:51,540
Well, all right.

3594
03:37:51,540 --> 03:37:53,659
I'm good.

3595
03:37:53,659 --> 03:37:55,969
Let me see if I want to change this around, though.

3596
03:37:57,139 --> 03:37:57,860
This is cool.

3597
03:37:58,659 --> 03:38:00,260
This is Giga.

3598
03:38:06,030 --> 03:38:08,260
Okay.

3599
03:38:08,260 --> 03:38:09,379
I'm happy with all this right now.

3600
03:38:10,260 --> 03:38:14,180
That sucks, actually.

3601
03:38:14,739 --> 03:38:15,940
Plague rats.

3602
03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:17,520
Extra knockback.

3603
03:38:17,520 --> 03:38:20,159
Or your projectiles come back to you.

3604
03:38:20,719 --> 03:38:21,700
Well, they already do.

3605
03:38:36,930 --> 03:38:38,100
That's...

3606
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:38,979
Okay.

3607
03:38:38,979 --> 03:38:44,079
So it was extra.

3608
03:38:44,079 --> 03:38:44,959
Oh, shit.

3609
03:38:44,959 --> 03:38:45,600
Okay, whatever.

3610
03:38:50,139 --> 03:38:52,700
So that probably wouldn't have happened if I didn't already have it on there.

3611
03:39:00,610 --> 03:39:01,889
You shot yourself in the head.

3612
03:39:01,889 --> 03:39:03,250
You need to give a thousand subs.

3613
03:39:03,250 --> 03:39:03,729
No.

3614
03:39:03,729 --> 03:39:04,770
This is not in the game.

3615
03:39:04,770 --> 03:39:05,649
Little hope.

3616
03:39:05,649 --> 03:39:11,440
That was looking like a pretty good run, too.

3617
03:39:12,159 --> 03:39:12,559
Oh, well.

3618
03:39:13,200 --> 03:39:17,200
What is that?

3619
03:39:17,760 --> 03:39:26,399
That's going to blow up that...

3620
03:39:26,399 --> 03:39:27,200
Okay, that's oil.

3621
03:39:27,200 --> 03:39:27,600
I get it.

3622
03:39:28,479 --> 03:39:34,139
You become drunk.

3623
03:39:34,700 --> 03:39:36,850
It's like a sword.

3624
03:39:37,649 --> 03:39:39,120
I'm already on fire.

3625
03:39:42,540 --> 03:39:43,420
What does drunk mean?

3626
03:39:44,059 --> 03:39:44,780
Holy shit.

3627
03:39:44,780 --> 03:39:46,139
Look at the capacity on this thing.

3628
03:39:47,969 --> 03:39:48,770
Firebolt.

3629
03:39:48,770 --> 03:39:50,690
This has got 11 capacity.

3630
03:39:51,940 --> 03:39:53,379
It only shoots one at a time, though.

3631
03:39:59,180 --> 03:40:00,139
And it's shuffled.

3632
03:40:00,139 --> 03:40:00,860
That's terrible.

3633
03:40:10,270 --> 03:40:10,590
Bad.

3634
03:40:11,309 --> 03:40:12,350
Yeah, it's kind of bad.

3635
03:40:12,989 --> 03:40:14,450
It can't even...

3636
03:40:14,450 --> 03:40:14,690
I don't...

3637
03:40:14,690 --> 03:40:16,450
Can that even become any good?

3638
03:40:16,450 --> 03:40:17,170
Or no?

3639
03:40:17,170 --> 03:40:18,129
Not really.

3640
03:40:18,129 --> 03:40:23,889
Is it a double cast?

3641
03:40:23,889 --> 03:40:24,530
No.

3642
03:40:24,530 --> 03:40:25,440
Does it?

3643
03:40:33,420 --> 03:40:34,139
Oh, that's pretty.

3644
03:40:34,780 --> 03:40:36,770
That's really pretty.

3645
03:40:36,770 --> 03:40:37,170
That's cool.

3646
03:40:37,809 --> 03:40:41,840
It's burning all, like, the sand.

3647
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:55,840
Let go...

3648
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:57,229
Just kick this out of the way.

3649
03:40:57,790 --> 03:41:01,340
I'm not touching that.

3650
03:41:08,209 --> 03:41:09,569
Oh, let's blow this up.

3651
03:41:10,129 --> 03:41:15,139
Looking good.

3652
03:41:18,690 --> 03:41:19,010
Loot.

3653
03:41:20,049 --> 03:41:21,659
Oh!

3654
03:41:21,659 --> 03:41:22,700
Oh, you guys just did that.

3655
03:41:22,700 --> 03:41:23,579
What's in it?

3656
03:41:23,579 --> 03:41:24,620
Okay, that was a thousand...

3657
03:41:24,620 --> 03:41:25,180
Oh my...

3658
03:41:25,180 --> 03:41:26,940
Okay, that's a thousand gold in there.

3659
03:41:27,870 --> 03:41:29,229
That's one thousand gold.

3660
03:41:29,229 --> 03:41:29,469
Okay.

3661
03:41:30,110 --> 03:41:31,950
Looking pretty good so far.

3662
03:41:31,950 --> 03:41:32,510
This is the run.

3663
03:41:33,149 --> 03:41:33,629
Just don't...

3664
03:41:34,190 --> 03:41:34,829
Don't hurt me.

3665
03:41:34,829 --> 03:41:35,629
Don't fuck it up.

3666
03:41:35,629 --> 03:41:37,389
Don't make, like, lava spawn.

3667
03:41:37,389 --> 03:41:38,270
Don't spawn a boss.

3668
03:41:42,379 --> 03:41:44,059
Chat, give, and chat, take away.

3669
03:41:44,780 --> 03:41:52,219
Is that a tea kettle?

3670
03:41:52,780 --> 03:41:56,290
Oh, it's an egg.

3671
03:41:57,090 --> 03:41:57,489
Wait!

3672
03:41:57,489 --> 03:41:58,770
This is going to be somebody in chat, right?

3673
03:41:59,489 --> 03:42:02,059
Who is it?

3674
03:42:02,059 --> 03:42:03,700
What's their name?

3675
03:42:04,340 --> 03:42:06,270
Do they have a name?

3676
03:42:06,270 --> 03:42:08,459
Oh no, that's ghosts.

3677
03:42:09,100 --> 03:42:16,500
All right, watch out.

3678
03:42:16,500 --> 03:42:17,379
I don't want to hurt you.

3679
03:42:17,379 --> 03:42:26,270
Okay.

3680
03:42:26,270 --> 03:42:26,989
I want to get in there.

3681
03:42:26,989 --> 03:42:27,549
There's something in there.

3682
03:42:27,549 --> 03:42:28,350
There's a potion in there.

3683
03:42:32,610 --> 03:42:33,250
Oh, sickom.

3684
03:42:33,889 --> 03:42:39,329
This is a berserkium potion.

3685
03:42:45,920 --> 03:42:46,879
And this is, like, a gem?

3686
03:42:48,129 --> 03:42:49,090
Broken wand?

3687
03:42:49,090 --> 03:42:50,690
Please get rid of an item to make space for it.

3688
03:42:50,690 --> 03:42:50,930
What's...

3689
03:42:50,930 --> 03:42:52,049
What do you mean, broken wand?

3690
03:42:55,790 --> 03:42:58,270
Your body has burnable gas for a time.

3691
03:42:58,270 --> 03:42:58,590
Okay.

3692
03:42:58,590 --> 03:42:59,309
Well, I don't...

3693
03:42:59,309 --> 03:43:00,030
What should I get rid of?

3694
03:43:02,340 --> 03:43:03,459
Fire potion?

3695
03:43:03,459 --> 03:43:04,340
All these, if I throw,

3696
03:43:04,340 --> 03:43:06,020
I feel like I'm going to explode immediately.

3697
03:43:13,809 --> 03:43:14,690
Broken wand.

3698
03:43:14,690 --> 03:43:15,170
What does it do?

3699
03:43:15,809 --> 03:43:17,709
This wand has snapped in half,

3700
03:43:17,709 --> 03:43:19,549
but it still crackles with magical energy.

3701
03:43:20,350 --> 03:43:24,530
A stink cloud.

3702
03:43:24,530 --> 03:43:25,170
Yeah.

3703
03:43:25,170 --> 03:43:25,809
You guys did it.

3704
03:43:26,370 --> 03:43:30,610
You can throw it for a random spell.

3705
03:43:31,170 --> 03:43:34,420
Okay.

3706
03:43:34,420 --> 03:43:35,940
Why did I think the frogs were friendly?

3707
03:43:42,540 --> 03:43:43,739
I thought the frogs were friendly.

3708
03:43:44,379 --> 03:43:56,260
I'm not even going to blow it up.

3709
03:43:57,059 --> 03:43:57,540
Yes, it is.

3710
03:43:59,090 --> 03:44:09,389
It's just all poison down there.

3711
03:44:09,389 --> 03:44:10,110
I can't even touch it.

3712
03:44:16,219 --> 03:44:19,899
I need some more money, first and foremost.

3713
03:44:27,549 --> 03:44:27,950
Hash.

3714
03:44:28,510 --> 03:44:30,159
Did I just hit myself?

3715
03:44:30,159 --> 03:44:31,440
I did, didn't I?

3716
03:44:32,159 --> 03:44:33,569
I'm moving fast?

3717
03:44:34,530 --> 03:44:45,729
This guy just died.

3718
03:44:48,049 --> 03:44:49,250
Am I moving that much faster?

3719
03:44:50,049 --> 03:44:51,329
Maybe a little.

3720
03:44:51,329 --> 03:44:52,290
Why do I care about money?

3721
03:44:52,290 --> 03:44:53,329
I have a thousand gold.

3722
03:44:53,329 --> 03:44:54,290
What am I doing?

3723
03:44:54,290 --> 03:44:55,569
I forgot about that.

3724
03:44:55,569 --> 03:45:03,969
Poison.

3725
03:45:03,969 --> 03:45:12,590
It's flexing.

3726
03:45:15,139 --> 03:45:15,540
Sure.

3727
03:45:15,540 --> 03:45:16,180
Okay.

3728
03:45:16,180 --> 03:45:17,459
Picked up a spell refresher.

3729
03:45:18,180 --> 03:45:20,579
This is a teleport wand.

3730
03:45:21,139 --> 03:45:21,700
Wait.

3731
03:45:21,700 --> 03:45:22,420
That's kind of interesting.

3732
03:45:22,420 --> 03:45:22,819
What is it?

3733
03:45:24,219 --> 03:45:25,979
Always cast gunpowder arc.

3734
03:45:28,209 --> 03:45:31,729
And I fly wherever I move to.

3735
03:45:31,729 --> 03:45:36,610
So this is a firewall or a fire walking from Diablo.

3736
03:45:37,250 --> 03:45:42,260
It sucks.

3737
03:45:42,260 --> 03:45:43,540
Yeah, it probably sucks.

3738
03:45:43,540 --> 03:45:47,309
This looks okay.

3739
03:45:47,309 --> 03:45:48,510
Four spells at the same time.

3740
03:45:49,620 --> 03:45:51,059
Always cast magic arrow.

3741
03:45:51,620 --> 03:45:53,059
And it's going to do all this.

3742
03:45:55,360 --> 03:45:58,459
Lower cast delay and spread it everywhere.

3743
03:45:59,100 --> 03:46:01,020
Black hole spark.

3744
03:46:01,020 --> 03:46:01,260
No.

3745
03:46:02,459 --> 03:46:02,940
Odd one.

3746
03:46:02,940 --> 03:46:03,579
No, it's not.

3747
03:46:03,579 --> 03:46:04,139
Fuck this thing.

3748
03:46:04,700 --> 03:46:07,340
I tried black hole before and it was a disaster.

3749
03:46:07,340 --> 03:46:15,120
Good.

3750
03:46:15,120 --> 03:46:17,090
Okay.

3751
03:46:17,090 --> 03:46:19,489
It's just the gigasaw thing again.

3752
03:46:20,879 --> 03:46:21,680
And what is this?

3753
03:46:25,059 --> 03:46:25,860
Bubble spark.

3754
03:46:25,860 --> 03:46:27,139
A bouncy inaccurate spell.

3755
03:46:27,139 --> 03:46:30,180
But this is huge spread and double spell.

3756
03:46:32,850 --> 03:46:34,049
Oh, it only casts one.

3757
03:46:34,610 --> 03:46:40,059
This thing sucks.

3758
03:46:40,059 --> 03:46:42,299
Bubble spark.

3759
03:46:42,299 --> 03:46:46,190
Third one is probably the best stats.

3760
03:46:47,059 --> 03:46:47,700
Axe mana.

3761
03:46:48,340 --> 03:46:50,209
Mana charge speed.

3762
03:46:50,209 --> 03:46:52,829
Cast delay.

3763
03:46:53,469 --> 03:46:56,079
This one's kind of good too.

3764
03:46:56,079 --> 03:47:01,680
I kind of want to play with this one though.

3765
03:47:05,170 --> 03:47:07,729
Always casting this as OP.

3766
03:47:07,729 --> 03:47:10,459
How much damage does it do?

3767
03:47:10,459 --> 03:47:10,860
10?

3768
03:47:10,860 --> 03:47:12,219
I guess that's good.

3769
03:47:12,219 --> 03:47:12,780
I'm going to get it.

3770
03:47:13,979 --> 03:47:17,629
I can just put other spells on this.

3771
03:47:17,629 --> 03:47:20,530
A bunch of hissy appear out of thin air.

3772
03:47:20,530 --> 03:47:21,409
What's hissy rain?

3773
03:47:47,979 --> 03:47:49,500
Is like a bad joke.

3774
03:47:50,540 --> 03:47:52,379
All right.

3775
03:47:52,379 --> 03:47:53,260
How about this time?

3776
03:47:54,209 --> 03:47:56,850
Everybody has to agree to give me the good options.

3777
03:47:57,569 --> 03:47:58,850
I need the extra help.

3778
03:47:59,489 --> 03:48:02,989
This is a really good start.

3779
03:48:03,629 --> 03:48:07,299
This is a very good start.

3780
03:48:07,299 --> 03:48:08,020
Look at this thing.

3781
03:48:08,020 --> 03:48:09,059
It's very good.

3782
03:48:11,649 --> 03:48:12,850
Good starter wand.

3783
03:48:14,930 --> 03:48:16,209
And you gave me a thousand gold

3784
03:48:16,209 --> 03:48:17,889
and you took it all away in the next room?

3785
03:48:19,629 --> 03:48:20,030
Really?

3786
03:48:20,590 --> 03:48:22,190
Hey, here's a thousand gold.

3787
03:48:22,190 --> 03:48:24,110
Let's spawn like late game enemies on you

3788
03:48:24,110 --> 03:48:25,069
and have you die.

3789
03:48:25,069 --> 03:48:38,190
You track projectiles for a while.

3790
03:48:39,629 --> 03:48:43,040
Wait, these can't hurt me.

3791
03:48:43,760 --> 03:48:44,979
What's wrong with this frog?

3792
03:48:45,700 --> 03:48:48,270
What happened to me?

3793
03:48:48,270 --> 03:48:49,229
Why I'm a fish?

3794
03:48:49,950 --> 03:48:50,989
He just ate me.

3795
03:49:00,370 --> 03:49:02,049
Give me something to work with.

3796
03:49:02,690 --> 03:49:13,139
Give me something to work with.

3797
03:49:13,139 --> 03:49:19,889
Try harder, boomer.

3798
03:49:19,889 --> 03:49:20,450
All right.

3799
03:49:20,450 --> 03:49:20,770
Fine.

3800
03:49:21,329 --> 03:49:23,940
That's how you want to play it?

3801
03:49:23,940 --> 03:49:24,819
I'll play it like that.

3802
03:49:25,379 --> 03:49:29,180
But if I were in the chat right now,

3803
03:49:29,180 --> 03:49:31,200
I would be pressing four.

3804
03:49:32,079 --> 03:49:33,200
Hey, guys.

3805
03:49:33,200 --> 03:49:33,840
I don't know.

3806
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:35,680
I'm kind of new to video games.

3807
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:37,520
I heard that there's a new Diablo coming out.

3808
03:49:37,520 --> 03:49:39,120
Do you know what the iteration is?

3809
03:49:39,920 --> 03:49:40,979
Is it three or is it...

3810
03:49:42,020 --> 03:49:43,620
I know there's a new Diablo coming out.

3811
03:49:45,139 --> 03:49:46,819
How many in the series have there been?

3812
03:49:46,819 --> 03:49:47,540
I don't even...

3813
03:49:47,540 --> 03:49:48,819
It's tricky for me.

3814
03:49:48,819 --> 03:49:49,860
In my mind, I don't know.

3815
03:49:59,440 --> 03:50:00,959
Huge worm appears.

3816
03:50:00,959 --> 03:50:02,079
I'm assuming he's here.

3817
03:50:02,639 --> 03:50:04,909
I'm assuming this huge worm is over here.

3818
03:50:05,709 --> 03:50:06,350
Yeah, there he is.

3819
03:50:08,030 --> 03:50:09,389
In the first room?

3820
03:50:10,030 --> 03:50:11,229
In room one?

3821
03:50:12,350 --> 03:50:13,229
Room one.

3822
03:50:14,030 --> 03:50:16,370
Why would you do this to me?

3823
03:50:16,370 --> 03:50:16,690
I didn't...

3824
03:50:16,690 --> 03:50:18,770
I just walked down out of the entrance.

3825
03:50:19,649 --> 03:50:22,209
All right.

3826
03:50:22,209 --> 03:50:23,090
I just gotta leave.

3827
03:50:23,090 --> 03:50:23,649
Get out quick.

3828
03:50:25,149 --> 03:50:26,350
Wherever he is, he's distracted.

3829
03:50:29,170 --> 03:50:30,049
Jesus Christ!

3830
03:50:31,250 --> 03:50:31,969
Is he blocking it?

3831
03:50:31,969 --> 03:50:32,610
What's he doing?

3832
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:34,639
What's wrong with him?

3833
03:50:34,639 --> 03:50:35,280
Oh my God!

3834
03:50:35,280 --> 03:50:36,399
I just blew his head up.

3835
03:50:36,399 --> 03:50:36,959
Is it gold?

3836
03:50:41,360 --> 03:50:42,079
There's no gold.

3837
03:50:51,329 --> 03:50:52,530
Should have drank his blood.

3838
03:50:52,530 --> 03:50:53,170
I don't know.

3839
03:50:53,170 --> 03:50:53,809
I don't even have...

3840
03:50:53,809 --> 03:50:54,690
I can't even do anything.

3841
03:50:55,409 --> 03:50:57,340
Oh, I have 80 gold.

3842
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:58,620
Yeah, I want the saw.

3843
03:50:58,620 --> 03:51:04,510
What the fuck?

3844
03:51:04,510 --> 03:51:05,870
You didn't even do that to me

3845
03:51:05,870 --> 03:51:06,989
and I just did it to myself.

3846
03:51:07,629 --> 03:51:22,319
Ooh.

3847
03:51:22,319 --> 03:51:28,510
This is my oh shit button

3848
03:51:28,510 --> 03:51:29,229
and this is the one I'm gonna use.

3849
03:51:29,229 --> 03:51:29,709
I'm gonna get...

3850
03:51:29,709 --> 03:51:30,350
Okay.

3851
03:51:30,350 --> 03:51:31,969
Improve my wands.

3852
03:51:31,969 --> 03:51:33,170
All your wands in new vicinity

3853
03:51:33,170 --> 03:51:34,290
get slightly better.

3854
03:51:34,290 --> 03:51:36,879
Did they?

3855
03:51:38,180 --> 03:51:38,680
Nice.

3856
03:51:40,959 --> 03:51:42,000
Nice, I can do this forever.

3857
03:51:42,639 --> 03:51:43,889
Why can I do this forever?

3858
03:51:43,889 --> 03:51:44,450
It's infinite.

3859
03:51:47,229 --> 03:51:47,790
Okay.

3860
03:51:47,790 --> 03:51:48,590
Now, what...

3861
03:51:48,590 --> 03:51:49,709
And the next one will give me health.

3862
03:51:50,909 --> 03:51:52,190
Perk lottery.

3863
03:51:52,190 --> 03:51:53,469
Goldest forever.

3864
03:51:53,469 --> 03:51:54,829
High mana, low capacity.

3865
03:51:56,159 --> 03:51:56,959
Wait a minute.

3866
03:51:56,959 --> 03:51:57,680
Should I do that one?

3867
03:52:03,069 --> 03:52:05,149
Lottery, lottery, lottery, lottery, lottery.

3868
03:52:05,149 --> 03:52:07,120
When you pick a perk

3869
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:09,040
there's a 50% chance the others won't disappear.

3870
03:52:09,040 --> 03:52:10,159
That's actually pretty awesome.

3871
03:52:10,159 --> 03:52:10,399
All right.

3872
03:52:10,399 --> 03:52:12,239
Now give me like max HP plus 20.

3873
03:52:12,799 --> 03:52:15,659
All right.

3874
03:52:15,659 --> 03:52:16,459
On this list,

3875
03:52:16,459 --> 03:52:18,860
is it gonna be like a give the person money?

3876
03:52:19,420 --> 03:52:20,459
Or give the person health?

3877
03:52:20,459 --> 03:52:20,959
I want it.

3878
03:52:21,739 --> 03:52:29,739
I'm not gonna use that.

3879
03:52:29,739 --> 03:52:30,379
It's gonna kill me.

3880
03:52:30,940 --> 03:52:32,139
Fuck that thing, seriously.

3881
03:52:32,940 --> 03:52:35,989
Okay.

3882
03:52:36,450 --> 03:52:40,540
Regeneration field.

3883
03:52:42,049 --> 03:52:42,930
That's what I want.

3884
03:52:42,930 --> 03:52:43,489
Give me that one.

3885
03:52:44,129 --> 03:52:46,459
That means it's gonna heal me, right?

3886
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:49,120
It's carrying a bomb.

3887
03:52:49,840 --> 03:52:55,329
Yeah, let me get a regeneration field.

3888
03:53:03,549 --> 03:53:04,049
Dead.

3889
03:53:06,799 --> 03:53:07,299
Yes.

3890
03:53:07,840 --> 03:53:08,959
Oh, yeah.

3891
03:53:08,959 --> 03:53:09,520
There it is.

3892
03:53:09,520 --> 03:53:10,319
You guys rock.

3893
03:53:10,319 --> 03:53:10,819
Thank you.

3894
03:53:11,680 --> 03:53:26,319
Oh, I can't get in there.

3895
03:53:26,319 --> 03:53:41,090
Don't fall.

3896
03:53:42,209 --> 03:53:43,010
Guy's holding the bomb.

3897
03:53:43,010 --> 03:53:44,129
Scared the shit out of me right now.

3898
03:53:44,690 --> 03:53:46,110
I want nothing to do with that.

3899
03:53:46,750 --> 03:53:52,340
Can't go that way.

3900
03:53:52,340 --> 03:53:53,219
Maybe I can go that way.

3901
03:53:54,909 --> 03:53:55,389
Nice job.

3902
03:53:55,389 --> 03:53:56,190
You kicked it the right way.

3903
03:54:04,719 --> 03:54:05,219
Fuck.

3904
03:54:05,920 --> 03:54:08,000
It would suck the damn screen.

3905
03:54:17,950 --> 03:54:18,450
Why?

3906
03:54:19,389 --> 03:54:21,629
I'm never picking that up ever again.

3907
03:54:21,629 --> 03:54:24,370
I'm not...

3908
03:54:24,370 --> 03:54:25,409
If I see a saw blade,

3909
03:54:25,409 --> 03:54:27,010
I'm gonna rip it out immediately

3910
03:54:27,010 --> 03:54:27,809
and throw it in the trash.

3911
03:54:27,809 --> 03:54:28,930
I'm not using that ever again.

3912
03:54:29,569 --> 03:54:45,389
You know, like typically,

3913
03:54:45,389 --> 03:54:47,569
I would be so embarrassed.

3914
03:54:47,569 --> 03:54:48,610
That's very embarrassing.

3915
03:54:48,610 --> 03:54:49,729
But like, no.

3916
03:54:49,729 --> 03:54:50,690
That weapon sucks.

3917
03:54:50,690 --> 03:54:51,729
It's too difficult to use.

3918
03:54:51,729 --> 03:54:52,850
It's not even fun to use it.

3919
03:54:54,129 --> 03:54:54,850
It's not good.

3920
03:54:54,850 --> 03:54:55,350
It's bad.

3921
03:54:56,129 --> 03:55:02,829
Nice try.

3922
03:55:12,030 --> 03:55:12,530
Ooh.

3923
03:55:13,219 --> 03:55:13,780
I'll take that.

3924
03:55:16,190 --> 03:55:18,110
Summon random homunculi.

3925
03:55:18,110 --> 03:55:19,950
A group of helpful little homunculi's

3926
03:55:19,950 --> 03:55:20,670
are here for you.

3927
03:55:20,670 --> 03:55:21,870
Oh, is there people in chat?

3928
03:55:21,870 --> 03:55:22,829
There you are.

3929
03:55:22,829 --> 03:55:23,329
Look it.

3930
03:55:24,610 --> 03:55:25,329
Oh, wow.

3931
03:55:27,520 --> 03:55:28,799
There's four of you right there.

3932
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:31,170
Well, let's go.

3933
03:55:31,809 --> 03:55:33,889
Let's go, Wizard of Oz crew.

3934
03:55:33,889 --> 03:55:34,690
Nice.

3935
03:55:34,690 --> 03:55:35,409
Good chug.

3936
03:55:35,409 --> 03:55:36,049
Good chuck.

3937
03:55:36,770 --> 03:55:37,569
CC monkey.

3938
03:55:40,829 --> 03:55:41,549
Well, I thought you died.

3939
03:55:45,760 --> 03:55:46,879
Hey, sad funda.

3940
03:55:47,440 --> 03:55:48,770
You're in the game now.

3941
03:55:49,409 --> 03:55:57,600
Those are fake viewers, are they?

3942
03:55:57,600 --> 03:55:58,719
They should be here.

3943
03:55:59,739 --> 03:56:00,379
Isn't that how it works?

3944
03:56:00,940 --> 03:56:05,100
What a horrible hallway to be in.

3945
03:56:06,700 --> 03:56:08,940
Oh, he just got sniped.

3946
03:56:08,940 --> 03:56:10,139
It's a really bad hallway.

3947
03:56:10,139 --> 03:56:11,260
Actually, really horrible.

3948
03:56:11,260 --> 03:56:11,760
Terrible.

3949
03:56:12,909 --> 03:56:13,469
Bad hallway.

3950
03:56:19,299 --> 03:56:19,700
Sorry.

3951
03:56:19,700 --> 03:56:20,200
He's...

3952
03:56:20,819 --> 03:56:22,659
You shouldn't have followed me down there.

3953
03:56:22,659 --> 03:56:24,100
Should not have followed me down there.

3954
03:56:29,149 --> 03:56:30,190
What's with these enemies?

3955
03:56:30,190 --> 03:56:30,750
They're terrible.

3956
03:56:32,420 --> 03:56:34,420
Very difficult role in the first room here.

3957
03:56:35,059 --> 03:56:42,049
Yeah, something good.

3958
03:56:44,979 --> 03:56:45,700
Rain cloud.

3959
03:56:46,420 --> 03:56:47,379
Whatever.

3960
03:56:47,379 --> 03:56:50,159
What was that?

3961
03:56:52,909 --> 03:56:53,229
That's a...

3962
03:56:53,229 --> 03:56:54,590
Wait, that's electrifying this.

3963
03:56:55,739 --> 03:56:56,700
New friendly ghosts.

3964
03:56:57,680 --> 03:57:00,719
A 8-bit ether and Red X Yeti.

3965
03:57:00,719 --> 03:57:05,700
Welcome to my...

3966
03:57:05,700 --> 03:57:06,340
If you guys didn't know,

3967
03:57:06,340 --> 03:57:10,500
these are my $5,000 level Patreon tier contributors.

3968
03:57:11,540 --> 03:57:13,059
You know, we jump in the game sometimes.

3969
03:57:13,860 --> 03:57:16,670
Hey, give that back.

3970
03:57:17,309 --> 03:57:18,559
Give that back.

3971
03:57:18,559 --> 03:57:19,040
That's my...

3972
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:20,159
You can't just take wands.

3973
03:57:20,879 --> 03:57:23,780
How do I get that back?

3974
03:57:24,420 --> 03:57:27,139
All right.

3975
03:57:27,139 --> 03:57:27,940
Give me that wand.

3976
03:57:36,219 --> 03:57:37,180
I need money.

3977
03:57:37,180 --> 03:57:42,770
I'll stand on that.

3978
03:57:44,139 --> 03:57:44,459
You know what?

3979
03:57:44,459 --> 03:57:44,700
Fine.

3980
03:57:44,700 --> 03:57:45,100
Give me...

3981
03:57:45,100 --> 03:57:45,420
Whatever.

3982
03:57:45,420 --> 03:57:46,219
Just give me the wand.

3983
03:57:46,860 --> 03:57:57,069
That's pretty good to get right now.

3984
03:57:57,069 --> 03:57:57,950
I need health again.

3985
03:58:01,569 --> 03:58:02,930
Where's water?

3986
03:58:02,930 --> 03:58:03,170
No.

3987
03:58:04,290 --> 03:58:04,770
Okay.

3988
03:58:04,770 --> 03:58:06,690
Like, dilute this so I can stand on it.

3989
03:58:09,260 --> 03:58:12,940
Okay.

3990
03:58:12,940 --> 03:58:13,979
That looks good.

3991
03:58:13,979 --> 03:58:15,840
I don't have that much money though,

3992
03:58:15,840 --> 03:58:16,719
but whatever.

3993
03:58:16,719 --> 03:58:17,200
Need health.

3994
03:58:17,840 --> 03:58:24,420
Okay.

3995
03:58:25,940 --> 03:58:26,579
Holy shit.

3996
03:58:26,579 --> 03:58:27,139
What is this?

3997
03:58:27,860 --> 03:58:29,309
I wish I had money.

3998
03:58:30,030 --> 03:58:30,270
All right.

3999
03:58:30,270 --> 03:58:31,469
Where's the money one?

4000
03:58:31,469 --> 03:58:32,270
Remove ground.

4001
03:58:32,909 --> 03:58:33,469
That's great.

4002
03:58:35,819 --> 03:58:36,059
What?

4003
03:58:37,819 --> 03:58:39,100
Everything stays.

4004
03:58:39,100 --> 03:58:40,219
You have angered the gods.

4005
03:58:42,459 --> 03:58:43,739
I didn't do that though.

4006
03:58:44,379 --> 03:58:44,620
What?

4007
03:58:45,979 --> 03:58:50,909
What is this?

4008
03:58:50,909 --> 03:58:51,229
Give me...

4009
03:58:51,229 --> 03:58:51,549
I don't know.

4010
03:58:51,549 --> 03:58:52,030
Give me this.

4011
03:58:52,670 --> 03:59:10,420
It's just...

4012
03:59:11,790 --> 03:59:14,030
It's just war and peace with you guys.

4013
03:59:14,030 --> 03:59:15,069
Hot and cold.

4014
03:59:15,069 --> 03:59:16,190
Fire and ice.

4015
03:59:16,190 --> 03:59:20,819
There's a thousand dollars.

4016
03:59:20,819 --> 03:59:22,350
You're Satan.

4017
03:59:22,350 --> 03:59:34,209
Somebody said,

4018
03:59:34,209 --> 03:59:35,329
I feel bad now.

4019
03:59:36,049 --> 03:59:39,459
Oh.

4020
03:59:39,459 --> 03:59:42,180
I see a health plus on there at number three.

4021
03:59:45,219 --> 03:59:46,020
That's a good one.

4022
03:59:48,479 --> 03:59:48,959
All right.

4023
03:59:48,959 --> 03:59:50,559
Can you guys just give me a god run

4024
03:59:50,559 --> 03:59:52,079
so I can get to like the end of the game?

4025
03:59:52,079 --> 03:59:53,360
I've gotten to like the last...

4026
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:54,319
Second to last floor.

4027
03:59:54,879 --> 03:59:55,600
I can't beat it.

4028
03:59:56,780 --> 03:59:58,860
Give me a god run

4029
03:59:58,860 --> 04:00:00,780
so I can just smoke every floor.

4030
04:00:01,340 --> 04:00:12,350
Is that a bad thing or a good thing?

4031
04:00:22,110 --> 04:00:23,709
I have to kill this to spite you guys.

4032
04:00:39,549 --> 04:00:39,709
All right.

4033
04:00:39,709 --> 04:00:40,510
I think it just...

4034
04:00:40,510 --> 04:00:41,229
Last time this...

4035
04:00:41,229 --> 04:00:41,469
I...

4036
04:00:42,030 --> 04:00:42,270
Wait.

4037
04:00:42,270 --> 04:00:42,590
Wasn't it...

4038
04:00:42,590 --> 04:00:43,309
Did I get the chest?

4039
04:00:44,030 --> 04:00:44,829
I don't even know.

4040
04:00:45,389 --> 04:00:45,950
Drink the blood.

4041
04:00:45,950 --> 04:00:46,350
Drink the blood.

4042
04:00:46,350 --> 04:00:46,829
Drink the blood.

4043
04:00:46,829 --> 04:00:47,149
Drink...

4044
04:00:47,149 --> 04:00:47,309
Okay.

4045
04:00:47,309 --> 04:00:47,469
Fine.

4046
04:00:47,469 --> 04:00:48,030
I'll drink blood.

4047
04:00:52,190 --> 04:00:52,590
All right.

4048
04:00:52,590 --> 04:00:53,309
I drank the blood.

4049
04:01:06,290 --> 04:01:07,409
Why am I still on fire?

4050
04:01:11,579 --> 04:01:11,819
Help.

4051
04:01:14,940 --> 04:01:15,180
Ooh.

4052
04:01:15,180 --> 04:01:16,379
What's this?

4053
04:01:16,379 --> 04:01:17,180
Fireball.

4054
04:01:17,180 --> 04:01:17,500
Yeah.

4055
04:01:17,500 --> 04:01:17,979
I'll take it.

4056
04:01:18,780 --> 04:01:24,510
He's stuck down here.

4057
04:01:24,510 --> 04:01:24,750
All right.

4058
04:01:24,750 --> 04:01:25,389
Drink his blood.

4059
04:01:26,110 --> 04:01:26,430
All right.

4060
04:01:26,430 --> 04:01:27,069
Drink his blood.

4061
04:01:27,870 --> 04:01:31,489
So you're seeing things more clearly.

4062
04:01:39,090 --> 04:01:39,809
Oh, I can't...

4063
04:01:44,190 --> 04:01:44,750
Fuck it.

4064
04:01:44,750 --> 04:01:45,229
Let's go.

4065
04:01:46,500 --> 04:01:48,579
Nearby materials transmuted to acid.

4066
04:01:50,100 --> 04:01:59,329
You know, okay.

4067
04:01:59,329 --> 04:02:01,489
Torch integration sounds like a good idea

4068
04:02:02,370 --> 04:02:03,969
but I think it only works out

4069
04:02:03,969 --> 04:02:04,930
if I activate it

4070
04:02:05,889 --> 04:02:07,569
on the third floor or something

4071
04:02:07,569 --> 04:02:08,690
because I don't have any items.

4072
04:02:09,250 --> 04:02:17,459
I thought it was going to be gold.

4073
04:02:17,459 --> 04:02:17,940
Oh.

4074
04:02:17,940 --> 04:02:18,340
Oh well.

4075
04:02:18,979 --> 04:02:23,739
You can disable things that you don't want.

4076
04:02:23,739 --> 04:02:24,059
Oh.

4077
04:02:24,459 --> 04:02:26,459
That's fun to mess around.

4078
04:02:41,340 --> 04:02:43,819
I see a couple of options that I like on there.

4079
04:02:43,819 --> 04:02:44,620
I'm not going to...

4080
04:02:44,620 --> 04:02:47,260
I will not influence the vote

4081
04:02:47,260 --> 04:02:48,219
but I'm just telling you

4082
04:02:48,219 --> 04:02:50,379
at least I swear to God

4083
04:02:50,379 --> 04:02:51,500
I didn't even look at what it was.

4084
04:02:52,139 --> 04:02:52,780
It's a rocket.

4085
04:02:52,780 --> 04:02:53,500
I thought it was a bomb.

4086
04:03:01,840 --> 04:03:02,639
Already right off the bat.

4087
04:03:02,639 --> 04:03:02,879
Okay.

4088
04:03:02,879 --> 04:03:03,360
I got to get...

4089
04:03:03,360 --> 04:03:04,079
I got to get up there.

4090
04:03:07,780 --> 04:03:08,420
50 HP.

4091
04:03:08,420 --> 04:03:08,979
Holy shit.

4092
04:03:08,979 --> 04:03:09,139
Yeah.

4093
04:03:09,139 --> 04:03:09,860
That's what I'm talking about.

4094
04:03:09,860 --> 04:03:10,659
Give me another one of those.

4095
04:03:10,659 --> 04:03:10,899
More.

4096
04:03:11,700 --> 04:03:15,950
Okay.

4097
04:03:15,950 --> 04:03:17,469
This looks like it's going to be the run.

4098
04:03:18,110 --> 04:03:18,750
If you understand.

4099
04:03:19,629 --> 04:03:21,149
This looks like it's going to be the run.

4100
04:03:22,989 --> 04:03:26,940
Bubble Spark.

4101
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:27,899
Super cast speed.

4102
04:03:30,379 --> 04:03:30,940
This is the one.

4103
04:03:30,940 --> 04:03:31,420
It is.

4104
04:03:31,420 --> 04:03:32,459
So don't mess this up.

4105
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:35,149
You know what to do.

4106
04:03:43,889 --> 04:03:44,610
You know what to do.

4107
04:03:44,610 --> 04:03:45,090
Look at this.

4108
04:03:45,090 --> 04:03:45,649
It's so good.

4109
04:03:47,329 --> 04:03:48,370
It's unbelievable.

4110
04:03:48,370 --> 04:03:50,370
It's very, very, very, very good.

4111
04:03:58,719 --> 04:03:59,360
Get...

4112
04:03:59,360 --> 04:04:01,309
I can't touch...

4113
04:04:01,309 --> 04:04:02,190
Get out of the way.

4114
04:04:02,190 --> 04:04:02,510
Fire.

4115
04:04:06,020 --> 04:04:11,489
Nothing else.

4116
04:04:12,049 --> 04:04:13,629
This looks like another wand in here.

4117
04:04:15,229 --> 04:04:21,200
Holy shit.

4118
04:04:21,200 --> 04:04:22,000
This thing sucks.

4119
04:04:29,309 --> 04:04:31,709
This is the worst wand of the entire game I've played so far.

4120
04:04:38,850 --> 04:04:39,090
Yes.

4121
04:04:39,729 --> 04:04:40,129
Shuffle.

4122
04:04:41,149 --> 04:04:41,870
0.5.

4123
04:04:41,870 --> 04:04:42,750
Recharge time.

4124
04:04:43,309 --> 04:04:44,659
Whatever.

4125
04:04:44,659 --> 04:04:45,059
Just take it.

4126
04:04:48,879 --> 04:04:50,049
What am I getting here?

4127
04:04:50,610 --> 04:04:51,170
What are we doing?

4128
04:04:51,170 --> 04:04:51,889
Treasure Rain.

4129
04:04:51,889 --> 04:04:52,290
Hell yeah.

4130
04:04:55,329 --> 04:04:55,729
No, no.

4131
04:04:55,729 --> 04:04:56,450
Bad place for it.

4132
04:04:56,450 --> 04:04:57,250
Bad place to do this.

4133
04:05:00,430 --> 04:05:01,149
Get all the big ones.

4134
04:05:04,260 --> 04:05:04,819
Come on.

4135
04:05:04,819 --> 04:05:05,780
There's another big one over here.

4136
04:05:06,930 --> 04:05:09,170
No.

4137
04:05:09,170 --> 04:05:11,780
Nice.

4138
04:05:11,780 --> 04:05:12,340
300 bucks.

4139
04:05:12,340 --> 04:05:12,579
Thanks.

4140
04:05:13,379 --> 04:05:14,020
Thank you, guys.

4141
04:05:15,260 --> 04:05:16,139
Really working out here.

4142
04:05:16,700 --> 04:05:17,659
Doing a great job.

4143
04:05:17,659 --> 04:05:18,700
I really appreciate it.

4144
04:05:18,700 --> 04:05:19,420
Thank you.

4145
04:05:19,420 --> 04:05:19,739
Tons.

4146
04:05:20,459 --> 04:05:21,020
Big thanks.

4147
04:05:21,819 --> 04:05:22,540
Major thank you.

4148
04:05:24,299 --> 04:05:25,500
Big thank you incoming.

4149
04:05:25,500 --> 04:05:25,979
Thanks, guys.

4150
04:05:27,100 --> 04:05:41,149
Don't kill me.

4151
04:05:41,149 --> 04:05:48,299
Pirate.

4152
04:05:52,100 --> 04:05:52,979
No begging.

4153
04:05:52,979 --> 04:05:53,459
Kill him.

4154
04:05:54,100 --> 04:05:56,079
Wait, you want me to beg?

4155
04:06:05,620 --> 04:06:06,979
We want you to beg.

4156
04:06:11,170 --> 04:06:11,649
Hold here.

4157
04:06:14,399 --> 04:06:14,639
Yes.

4158
04:06:15,440 --> 04:06:19,540
I don't even know what twitchy is,

4159
04:06:19,540 --> 04:06:21,010
but I feel like it's not good.

4160
04:06:21,729 --> 04:06:22,770
And I feel like I don't want it.

4161
04:06:27,549 --> 04:06:28,909
Loot.

4162
04:06:28,909 --> 04:06:29,469
You guys have...

4163
04:06:29,469 --> 04:06:30,750
Look at you guys working together here.

4164
04:06:31,950 --> 04:06:32,909
It's a beautiful thing.

4165
04:06:34,750 --> 04:06:40,690
And that's a mega wand.

4166
04:06:44,290 --> 04:06:44,690
Purple.

4167
04:06:45,250 --> 04:06:50,850
Triple spell propane tank.

4168
04:06:51,729 --> 04:06:52,530
Propane tank.

4169
04:06:52,530 --> 04:06:53,250
Propane tank.

4170
04:06:53,250 --> 04:06:53,969
Propane tank.

4171
04:06:53,969 --> 04:06:54,690
Propane tank.

4172
04:06:55,250 --> 04:06:57,379
It's a mega wand.

4173
04:06:57,379 --> 04:06:58,340
I don't even know what that means.

4174
04:06:58,979 --> 04:07:00,659
It shoots 10 propane tanks?

4175
04:07:01,379 --> 04:07:02,659
Wait.

4176
04:07:02,659 --> 04:07:05,709
It shoots two at the...

4177
04:07:05,709 --> 04:07:06,030
Okay.

4178
04:07:06,030 --> 04:07:08,030
So it's going to shoot four at a time.

4179
04:07:08,030 --> 04:07:12,100
I feel like that's going to come in

4180
04:07:12,659 --> 04:07:14,180
not very much handy soon.

4181
04:07:14,180 --> 04:07:17,870
I just need to see what it does.

4182
04:07:19,420 --> 04:07:20,219
Holy shit.

4183
04:07:20,940 --> 04:07:22,770
Okay.

4184
04:07:22,770 --> 04:07:23,170
That's...

4185
04:07:23,170 --> 04:07:23,489
I don't...

4186
04:07:24,129 --> 04:07:24,770
Okay.

4187
04:07:24,770 --> 04:07:25,010
Okay.

4188
04:07:25,010 --> 04:07:25,969
It hurts being in that.

4189
04:07:25,969 --> 04:07:26,610
I don't know what that...

4190
04:07:27,250 --> 04:07:27,809
I don't like it.

4191
04:07:27,809 --> 04:07:28,290
I don't want it.

4192
04:07:28,850 --> 04:07:32,860
Is this all gas?

4193
04:07:33,659 --> 04:07:38,159
It hurts if I touch it.

4194
04:07:55,920 --> 04:07:57,120
Do not do one.

4195
04:07:58,239 --> 04:07:58,739
Ow!

4196
04:08:02,750 --> 04:08:03,870
Don't do one.

4197
04:08:03,870 --> 04:08:04,989
Do not do one.

4198
04:08:04,989 --> 04:08:06,030
Don't do it.

4199
04:08:06,030 --> 04:08:07,229
I'm going to wait and see what you guys do

4200
04:08:07,229 --> 04:08:08,510
because there's a health pack right here.

4201
04:08:10,750 --> 04:08:11,780
Excess thank you.

4202
04:08:18,399 --> 04:08:20,079
Triplicate bolt?

4203
04:08:20,079 --> 04:08:24,270
Triplicate bolt.

4204
04:08:24,270 --> 04:08:27,940
I want to see what it does.

4205
04:08:29,649 --> 04:08:30,850
Teleporting cast.

4206
04:08:30,850 --> 04:08:31,329
Don't want it.

4207
04:08:31,889 --> 04:08:32,610
Bubble spark.

4208
04:08:34,159 --> 04:08:34,559
And...

4209
04:08:34,559 --> 04:08:34,959
Hold on.

4210
04:08:34,959 --> 04:08:35,680
Wait.

4211
04:08:35,680 --> 04:08:38,270
I can do another bubble spark here.

4212
04:08:45,299 --> 04:08:46,020
Wait.

4213
04:08:46,020 --> 04:08:48,659
Does this work?

4214
04:08:48,659 --> 04:08:56,579
Kind of like a shotgun.

4215
04:08:57,540 --> 04:09:02,719
Oh, it needs mana.

4216
04:09:05,229 --> 04:09:06,270
It needs too much mana.

4217
04:09:07,149 --> 04:09:11,760
That's so good.

4218
04:09:17,120 --> 04:09:18,559
Wand four has mana cast.

4219
04:09:20,450 --> 04:09:20,690
Wait.

4220
04:09:20,690 --> 04:09:21,250
Hold on.

4221
04:09:21,250 --> 04:09:22,370
Are you saying switch this?

4222
04:09:39,389 --> 04:09:39,870
No.

4223
04:09:39,870 --> 04:09:47,149
What if I had to do this though?

4224
04:09:47,950 --> 04:09:50,590
Become invincible for one minute.

4225
04:09:50,590 --> 04:09:51,229
Oh, thanks.

4226
04:09:51,870 --> 04:09:52,430
What does this do?

4227
04:09:56,030 --> 04:09:56,989
I think that's all right.

4228
04:09:58,030 --> 04:09:59,069
No, it's not.

4229
04:09:59,069 --> 04:09:59,709
Too much mana.

4230
04:10:04,459 --> 04:10:05,100
This is perfect.

4231
04:10:06,909 --> 04:10:08,750
Put it all on the fourth wand.

4232
04:10:08,750 --> 04:10:11,819
You're wasting immortality.

4233
04:10:11,819 --> 04:10:12,620
Well, what do you want me to do?

4234
04:10:13,420 --> 04:10:15,709
You wasted it.

4235
04:10:15,709 --> 04:10:16,110
Move.

4236
04:10:16,110 --> 04:10:16,590
Do something.

4237
04:10:18,110 --> 04:10:19,229
Triple cast, Germo.

4238
04:10:22,030 --> 04:10:22,750
Triple spell.

4239
04:10:23,309 --> 04:10:25,780
What are you saying, dude?

4240
04:10:25,780 --> 04:10:26,739
Hold on.

4241
04:10:26,739 --> 04:10:31,600
Spark bolt on three.

4242
04:10:33,620 --> 04:10:35,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4243
04:10:35,219 --> 04:10:38,129
Spark.

4244
04:10:38,129 --> 04:10:39,409
Okay.

4245
04:10:39,409 --> 04:10:41,170
So you're saying that put these down here

4246
04:10:41,170 --> 04:10:42,370
and then put this down here.

4247
04:10:57,649 --> 04:11:13,899
That's pretty...

4248
04:11:13,899 --> 04:11:15,340
That's really good though.

4249
04:11:15,340 --> 04:11:16,700
But is it good enough?

4250
04:11:25,329 --> 04:11:25,809
What's...

4251
04:11:25,809 --> 04:11:26,450
What did you do to me?

4252
04:11:27,010 --> 04:11:28,819
What did you do to me?

4253
04:11:28,819 --> 04:11:29,459
What did you do?

4254
04:11:30,180 --> 04:11:31,459
Who did you just summon?

4255
04:11:31,459 --> 04:11:50,450
Projectile repulsion field.

4256
04:11:50,450 --> 04:11:51,659
Breathless.

4257
04:11:51,659 --> 04:11:53,020
Faster levitation.

4258
04:11:53,020 --> 04:11:53,600
I can't...

4259
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:54,079
Okay.

4260
04:11:54,079 --> 04:11:55,040
This one.

4261
04:11:55,040 --> 04:11:55,520
Yeah.

4262
04:11:55,520 --> 04:12:12,139
Is that good?

4263
04:12:12,940 --> 04:12:13,979
Run, you fool.

4264
04:12:13,979 --> 04:12:15,180
I mean, this is really good.

4265
04:12:18,260 --> 04:12:18,739
No.

4266
04:12:18,739 --> 04:12:24,319
He's stalling.

4267
04:12:24,319 --> 04:12:24,719
I don't...

4268
04:12:24,719 --> 04:12:25,440
I don't want to...

4269
04:12:25,440 --> 04:12:25,920
This is like...

4270
04:12:25,920 --> 04:12:27,280
You guys summoned a boss.

4271
04:12:27,280 --> 04:12:30,750
Go to shop and replace one.

4272
04:12:30,750 --> 04:12:34,659
Oh, wait.

4273
04:12:34,659 --> 04:12:35,940
I can get with this one too.

4274
04:12:35,940 --> 04:12:51,709
Move this to here.

4275
04:12:51,709 --> 04:12:54,530
This to here.

4276
04:12:54,530 --> 04:12:55,489
And then I let...

4277
04:12:55,489 --> 04:12:55,729
Wait.

4278
04:12:55,729 --> 04:12:56,129
This one is...

4279
04:12:56,129 --> 04:12:57,090
What the fuck did I...

4280
04:12:57,090 --> 04:12:57,969
What am I doing with this one?

4281
04:12:59,979 --> 04:13:00,540
Sea of...

4282
04:13:01,260 --> 04:13:02,219
Don't do that right now.

4283
04:13:02,219 --> 04:13:02,459
Hold on.

4284
04:13:02,459 --> 04:13:04,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4285
04:13:04,219 --> 04:13:05,100
I gotta go.

4286
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:06,139
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.

4287
04:13:06,139 --> 04:13:06,940
I gotta go, I gotta go.

4288
04:13:07,500 --> 04:13:11,250
Why is there poison in here?

4289
04:13:12,129 --> 04:13:14,209
What is this?

4290
04:13:16,370 --> 04:13:18,690
What is this Star Trek beam?

4291
04:13:18,690 --> 04:13:21,569
And why is it filling the entire game?

4292
04:13:22,209 --> 04:13:38,819
Oh, shit.

4293
04:13:39,379 --> 04:13:41,389
Get rid of this...

4294
04:13:41,389 --> 04:13:41,870
How do I get rid of...

4295
04:13:41,870 --> 04:13:42,829
I gotta get rid of that fire.

4296
04:13:42,829 --> 04:13:43,790
I don't know what that is.

4297
04:13:43,790 --> 04:13:45,299
Okay, I'm gonna...

4298
04:13:45,299 --> 04:13:50,979
That was...

4299
04:13:51,700 --> 04:13:52,180
Jesus.

4300
04:13:52,979 --> 04:13:54,420
No, it's gonna follow me up here.

4301
04:14:02,979 --> 04:14:04,510
You know what I think when I see that?

4302
04:14:04,510 --> 04:14:06,030
I just think of like a soda.

4303
04:14:06,030 --> 04:14:07,709
When you pour a Coke for the first time.

4304
04:14:08,350 --> 04:14:09,629
What on earth?

4305
04:14:09,629 --> 04:14:10,590
Summon egg.

4306
04:14:11,790 --> 04:14:13,069
Summon a shitload of eggs?

4307
04:14:14,780 --> 04:14:26,260
Fire?

4308
04:14:26,260 --> 04:14:26,659
This is...

4309
04:14:26,659 --> 04:14:27,139
I just...

4310
04:14:27,139 --> 04:14:28,180
It's a friend gun.

4311
04:14:31,229 --> 04:14:31,790
Holy shit.

4312
04:14:31,790 --> 04:14:32,590
This is unbelievable.

4313
04:14:32,590 --> 04:14:33,069
Okay, let's go.

4314
04:14:33,709 --> 04:14:40,540
I'm just gonna be a Diablo II necromancer.

4315
04:14:41,100 --> 04:14:45,899
Thanks for the 80 HP.

4316
04:14:49,950 --> 04:14:51,309
It's recharging.

4317
04:14:51,309 --> 04:14:52,590
Oh, I have too many people out.

4318
04:14:53,229 --> 04:14:58,829
All right.

4319
04:14:58,829 --> 04:15:00,590
There's too much shit on the screen right now.

4320
04:15:00,590 --> 04:15:02,190
And I need to douse myself.

4321
04:15:03,620 --> 04:15:04,899
What is shooting at me?

4322
04:15:05,780 --> 04:15:06,579
Too much on the screen.

4323
04:15:06,579 --> 04:15:07,379
Way too much on the screen.

4324
04:15:07,379 --> 04:15:08,340
I have no idea what's going on.

4325
04:15:10,610 --> 04:15:12,129
I gotta turn like the particles down.

4326
04:15:12,930 --> 04:15:14,930
I have absolutely no fucking idea what's happening.

4327
04:15:15,729 --> 04:15:18,479
Are they shooting me?

4328
04:15:21,139 --> 04:15:22,579
What the fuck is going on?

4329
04:15:23,459 --> 04:15:24,559
Put me out!

4330
04:15:24,559 --> 04:15:25,520
Put me out!

4331
04:15:25,520 --> 04:15:26,239
Put me out!

4332
04:15:26,879 --> 04:15:27,520
Put me out!

4333
04:15:28,239 --> 04:15:28,639
Put me out!

4334
04:15:28,639 --> 04:15:29,120
Put me out!

4335
04:15:30,159 --> 04:15:31,040
Go into the water!

4336
04:15:42,370 --> 04:15:42,690
All right.

4337
04:15:49,219 --> 04:15:51,059
It's two all over the place.

4338
04:15:51,059 --> 04:15:51,860
I can't do it.

4339
04:15:52,659 --> 04:15:53,219
I can't do it.

4340
04:15:53,219 --> 04:15:58,540
Now, give me a shielding ghost.

4341
04:15:58,540 --> 04:15:59,899
So, hold on a minute.

4342
04:15:59,899 --> 04:16:01,100
What was going on there?

4343
04:16:01,659 --> 04:16:04,620
Summoned an egg that houses a friendly creature.

4344
04:16:05,180 --> 04:16:07,600
Or just give her the fire thing?

4345
04:16:08,159 --> 04:16:12,799
Energy orb.

4346
04:16:12,799 --> 04:16:13,760
Critical plus.

4347
04:16:14,559 --> 04:16:16,799
Full scatter spell.

4348
04:16:17,600 --> 04:16:21,780
Oceans appear.

4349
04:16:21,780 --> 04:16:24,299
Are those good?

4350
04:16:25,020 --> 04:16:25,500
These are.

4351
04:16:25,979 --> 04:16:27,979
This better not kill me when I'm done.

4352
04:16:28,620 --> 04:16:34,670
What is this Skittles one down here?

4353
04:16:39,010 --> 04:16:39,250
Okay.

4354
04:16:39,250 --> 04:16:40,209
Should I eat the Skittles?

4355
04:16:40,770 --> 04:16:42,129
No, I'm not eating anything.

4356
04:16:42,129 --> 04:16:43,409
I'm not touching any of this shit.

4357
04:16:49,870 --> 04:16:51,149
I kind of have to go this way.

4358
04:16:53,200 --> 04:16:54,159
Controls are backwards.

4359
04:16:58,129 --> 04:16:58,850
Get out of here.

4360
04:17:02,379 --> 04:17:03,100
Drink it all?

4361
04:17:15,700 --> 04:17:16,579
I can't leave.

4362
04:17:17,760 --> 04:17:18,079
Okay.

4363
04:17:18,079 --> 04:17:18,319
Get...

4364
04:17:18,319 --> 04:17:18,639
Wait.

4365
04:17:18,639 --> 04:17:19,040
I think I...

4366
04:17:19,760 --> 04:17:20,879
I have explosives, right?

4367
04:17:25,120 --> 04:17:25,840
Don't...

4368
04:17:25,840 --> 04:17:26,719
What are you doing?

4369
04:17:31,250 --> 04:17:31,489
No!

4370
04:17:31,489 --> 04:17:35,600
Fuck me!

4371
04:17:35,600 --> 04:17:37,280
Why did it aim back at me?

4372
04:17:38,000 --> 04:17:39,200
You have angered the gods.

4373
04:17:39,200 --> 04:17:40,399
I didn't do anything.

4374
04:17:40,399 --> 04:17:41,360
I'm trying to leave.

4375
04:17:43,469 --> 04:17:44,510
Please, let me leave.

4376
04:17:45,309 --> 04:17:51,170
Blow up this thing over here.

4377
04:17:52,379 --> 04:17:53,420
Be angry, but just...

4378
04:17:53,420 --> 04:17:54,780
It's going to collapse, isn't it?

4379
04:17:54,780 --> 04:17:56,940
Your projectiles leave a trail of water.

4380
04:17:58,290 --> 04:17:59,250
I can't even move.

4381
04:18:07,299 --> 04:18:07,940
Oh, shit.

4382
04:18:07,940 --> 04:18:08,659
There he is.

4383
04:18:09,219 --> 04:18:10,100
He's so mad.

4384
04:18:12,819 --> 04:18:13,780
He can't even get in here, though.

4385
04:18:13,780 --> 04:18:15,540
This is so anti-climactic.

4386
04:18:16,260 --> 04:18:19,520
Oh, no.

4387
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:20,479
He's charmed.

4388
04:18:20,559 --> 04:18:21,680
He's having problems, too.

4389
04:18:22,479 --> 04:18:22,959
Drink it.

4390
04:18:22,959 --> 04:18:23,760
I'm drinking it.

4391
04:18:26,079 --> 04:18:26,719
Go left?

4392
04:18:35,809 --> 04:18:36,129
Hold on.

4393
04:18:36,129 --> 04:18:38,450
The controls are backwards.

4394
04:18:38,450 --> 04:18:38,850
Wait.

4395
04:18:39,409 --> 04:18:40,590
What's happening?

4396
04:18:40,590 --> 04:18:40,989
Oh, my God.

4397
04:18:40,989 --> 04:18:41,469
Where am I?

4398
04:18:52,350 --> 04:18:52,670
Okay.

4399
04:18:52,670 --> 04:18:53,229
I think we're...

4400
04:18:53,229 --> 04:18:53,549
Okay.

4401
04:19:08,059 --> 04:19:08,700
Dude, I'm...

4402
04:19:09,739 --> 04:19:10,059
Okay.

4403
04:19:10,059 --> 04:19:10,860
We need to slow down.

4404
04:19:11,950 --> 04:19:12,750
I need to slow down.

4405
04:19:14,670 --> 04:19:15,309
And give me...

4406
04:19:17,870 --> 04:19:18,270
HP.

4407
04:19:24,559 --> 04:19:25,760
There's a golden wand in here.

4408
04:19:26,399 --> 04:19:27,440
Is it electrified?

4409
04:19:27,440 --> 04:19:28,319
This is electrified.

4410
04:19:29,120 --> 04:19:29,520
Shoot it.

4411
04:19:30,479 --> 04:19:38,819
Fuck.

4412
04:19:38,819 --> 04:19:39,700
No, just...

4413
04:19:39,700 --> 04:19:42,500
It's electrified.

4414
04:19:42,500 --> 04:19:42,979
I don't want to touch one.

4415
04:19:42,979 --> 04:19:43,620
It's electricity.

4416
04:19:44,260 --> 04:19:49,659
I want a crew.

4417
04:19:49,659 --> 04:19:55,059
How come they're not...

4418
04:19:55,059 --> 04:19:56,299
What's wrong?

4419
04:19:56,299 --> 04:20:03,090
Why are they not summoning anything?

4420
04:20:03,090 --> 04:20:17,139
Who is good and who is bad?

4421
04:20:17,139 --> 04:20:17,620
I don't know.

4422
04:20:18,340 --> 04:20:23,629
Okay.

4423
04:20:23,629 --> 04:20:23,950
Health.

4424
04:20:24,510 --> 04:20:28,030
Health pack.

4425
04:20:28,030 --> 04:20:33,489
Don't shoot the friendly.

4426
04:20:33,489 --> 04:20:34,370
They turn hostile.

4427
04:20:34,370 --> 04:20:35,649
That's going to be hard to do.

4428
04:20:36,530 --> 04:20:40,190
Don't shoot the friendlies.

4429
04:20:40,190 --> 04:20:40,829
Good luck.

4430
04:20:40,829 --> 04:20:42,110
There's like 15 of them.

4431
04:20:42,829 --> 04:20:49,709
I don't even know what just happened.

4432
04:20:49,709 --> 04:21:03,170
Your friend killed you.

4433
04:21:03,170 --> 04:21:03,489
All right.

4434
04:21:04,290 --> 04:21:07,870
I'm so addicted to this game,

4435
04:21:07,870 --> 04:21:09,309
but I will never complete it.

4436
04:21:09,309 --> 04:21:10,510
I will be honest with you.

4437
04:21:19,250 --> 04:21:20,530
I don't know what's wrong with my mind.

4438
04:21:20,530 --> 04:21:22,370
I thought that just said expired nuts

4439
04:21:23,170 --> 04:21:26,659
for a second.

4440
04:21:26,659 --> 04:21:38,159
I like to start on one.

4441
04:21:56,219 --> 04:21:59,780
Did you guys do that or did I do that?

4442
04:22:00,739 --> 04:22:01,219
I don't know.

4443
04:22:01,940 --> 04:22:08,739
I don't know what you guys just did,

4444
04:22:09,299 --> 04:22:10,899
but this fucked me all up.

4445
04:22:14,850 --> 04:22:15,569
Take cover.

4446
04:22:15,569 --> 04:22:15,889
Boom.

4447
04:22:16,610 --> 04:22:21,979
How much fire on this map?

4448
04:22:22,540 --> 04:22:33,409
I'm just getting out.

4449
04:22:33,409 --> 04:22:34,610
Just get me out of here.

4450
04:22:34,610 --> 04:22:36,209
I don't like that map.

4451
04:22:36,209 --> 04:22:37,170
Didn't like the spawn, right?

4452
04:22:37,170 --> 04:22:37,809
Didn't like any of...

4453
04:22:41,340 --> 04:22:42,139
Burning trail.

4454
04:22:44,110 --> 04:22:44,829
Explosion.

4455
04:22:45,629 --> 04:22:48,049
Should I...

4456
04:22:48,049 --> 04:22:48,450
Hold on.

4457
04:22:49,090 --> 04:22:51,219
An explosion for this one?

4458
04:23:03,579 --> 04:23:06,780
It just explodes when you press the button.

4459
04:23:07,579 --> 04:23:12,219
Of course it does.

4460
04:23:12,780 --> 04:23:16,719
And now I don't have any more money.

4461
04:23:17,520 --> 04:23:18,319
So we're just going to go.

4462
04:23:19,120 --> 04:23:22,459
You need a projectile on it.

4463
04:23:26,739 --> 04:23:27,940
What the fuck?

4464
04:23:27,940 --> 04:23:29,059
I just put it on.

4465
04:23:29,860 --> 04:23:30,659
You have trouble...

4466
04:23:31,920 --> 04:23:32,319
Turn it off.

4467
04:23:32,319 --> 04:23:33,040
Turn it off.

4468
04:23:33,040 --> 04:23:33,760
Get this off.

4469
04:23:33,760 --> 04:23:34,159
Get it off.

4470
04:23:34,159 --> 04:23:34,719
Get it off the bar.

4471
04:23:34,719 --> 04:23:35,440
Get it off the hotbar.

4472
04:23:36,000 --> 04:23:42,219
Projectile duplication.

4473
04:23:43,100 --> 04:23:44,059
Stainless armor.

4474
04:23:44,620 --> 04:23:48,909
I feel like these both are good.

4475
04:23:54,290 --> 04:23:55,329
You take 50% less damage

4476
04:23:55,329 --> 04:23:56,930
as long as you don't have any stains on you.

4477
04:23:56,930 --> 04:23:59,659
I'm assuming that I have stains on me right now.

4478
04:24:01,899 --> 04:24:11,069
How do you get rid of stains?

4479
04:24:11,069 --> 04:24:12,270
Oh, you use oxy clean.

4480
04:24:15,729 --> 04:24:16,610
I need to walk around.

4481
04:24:25,149 --> 04:24:26,270
Okay, I take 50% less damage

4482
04:24:26,270 --> 04:24:27,629
as long as I don't have any stains.

4483
04:24:27,629 --> 04:24:45,170
What should we play tomorrow?

4484
04:24:45,729 --> 04:24:47,569
Any ideas?

4485
04:24:47,569 --> 04:24:48,290
I'm dead.

4486
04:24:48,290 --> 04:24:49,170
Let's find what I lost.

4487
04:24:49,170 --> 04:24:49,569
Okay, cool.

4488
04:24:50,690 --> 04:24:53,600
What do you guys want to do tomorrow?

4489
04:24:55,739 --> 04:24:56,620
More of this?

4490
04:24:56,620 --> 04:24:57,659
No, I can't do more of this.

4491
04:24:57,659 --> 04:24:58,379
I'm not good at this.

4492
04:25:06,059 --> 04:25:07,180
I love this game.

4493
04:25:07,739 --> 04:25:09,500
I love everything it stands for.

4494
04:25:09,500 --> 04:25:10,379
I love what it is

4495
04:25:10,379 --> 04:25:11,500
and I love all what it's about.

4496
04:25:15,180 --> 04:25:17,100
I need like two people to play this.

4497
04:25:17,100 --> 04:25:18,780
I need to split my body in half

4498
04:25:18,780 --> 04:25:20,540
and have one person control the aiming

4499
04:25:20,540 --> 04:25:22,139
and the shooting

4500
04:25:22,139 --> 04:25:24,059
and one person to move around.

4501
04:25:24,059 --> 04:25:26,610
Does anybody get that?

4502
04:25:27,950 --> 04:25:29,549
Because like aiming at the enemies

4503
04:25:29,549 --> 04:25:31,229
and oh, I got to shoot those guys

4504
04:25:31,229 --> 04:25:32,430
and watch out for the projectiles

4505
04:25:32,430 --> 04:25:33,549
that are right here.

4506
04:25:33,549 --> 04:25:34,750
I need to split myself in half

4507
04:25:34,750 --> 04:25:35,629
and have one person have the mouse

4508
04:25:35,629 --> 04:25:37,629
and one person have the WASD.

4509
04:25:37,629 --> 04:25:44,319
Because I need like two people

4510
04:25:44,319 --> 04:25:45,520
need to pay attention in this.

4511
04:25:46,399 --> 04:25:48,879
It's focusing on where an enemy is

4512
04:25:48,879 --> 04:25:49,840
and aiming and shooting at him

4513
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:50,399
and then watch out.

4514
04:25:50,399 --> 04:25:51,280
There's a projectile

4515
04:25:51,280 --> 04:25:51,920
going to hit you in the face.

4516
04:25:52,479 --> 04:25:53,760
Just split myself in half.

4517
04:25:53,760 --> 04:25:55,569
What was that?

4518
04:25:55,569 --> 04:25:57,549
Oh, that was not bad.

4519
04:25:57,549 --> 04:26:00,829
It's called Motor Skills.

4520
04:26:01,389 --> 04:26:04,909
Hey, I beat Dark Souls.

4521
04:26:04,909 --> 04:26:06,030
Hey, no, excuse me.

4522
04:26:06,030 --> 04:26:08,909
I beat Sekiro last boss on stream.

4523
04:26:09,860 --> 04:26:10,579
You know some streamers

4524
04:26:10,579 --> 04:26:11,700
that fucking gave up on that.

4525
04:26:11,700 --> 04:26:12,420
I beat that on stream.

4526
04:26:13,360 --> 04:26:14,959
Final, true final boss of Sekiro.

4527
04:26:14,959 --> 04:26:15,920
I beat it on stream

4528
04:26:15,920 --> 04:26:20,559
with less than like 50 attempts.

4529
04:26:20,559 --> 04:26:21,760
I mean, Motor Skills.

4530
04:26:21,760 --> 04:26:22,639
I don't know if that's what it is.

4531
04:26:26,770 --> 04:26:27,569
Played Binding of Isaac.

4532
04:26:27,569 --> 04:26:28,450
Yeah, and I did very well.

4533
04:26:29,500 --> 04:26:30,700
Binding of Isaac is a little different

4534
04:26:30,700 --> 04:26:33,069
because Binding of Isaac is,

4535
04:26:33,969 --> 04:26:35,329
it's like zoomed in.

4536
04:26:35,329 --> 04:26:36,530
It's easier to like,

4537
04:26:36,530 --> 04:26:38,690
because an enemy over here

4538
04:26:38,690 --> 04:26:39,889
could like shoot a projectile

4539
04:26:39,889 --> 04:26:41,409
that moves like this and hit you.

4540
04:26:41,409 --> 04:26:42,610
Well, I have to pay attention

4541
04:26:42,610 --> 04:26:43,889
like in this sphere here.

4542
04:26:43,889 --> 04:26:44,850
Like I need to be,

4543
04:26:44,850 --> 04:26:46,930
it's not just like a cube this big

4544
04:26:46,930 --> 04:26:49,299
like Isaac is.

4545
04:26:56,909 --> 04:26:59,579
The game's very good.

4546
04:26:59,579 --> 04:27:00,860
Like this is a very good game.

4547
04:27:01,500 --> 04:27:04,700
I find it to be very, very fun

4548
04:27:04,700 --> 04:27:05,500
and very challenging

4549
04:27:05,500 --> 04:27:06,139
and very interesting.

4550
04:27:15,780 --> 04:27:17,139
I already know what you guys are going to pick.

4551
04:27:17,780 --> 04:27:19,780
And it's making me very upset.

4552
04:27:26,420 --> 04:27:27,700
So in that case,

4553
04:27:28,340 --> 04:27:29,780
I'm going to just run to the exit.

4554
04:27:30,260 --> 04:27:37,819
Oh, he's not even invisible.

4555
04:27:37,819 --> 04:27:38,379
He's just kind of,

4556
04:27:39,020 --> 04:27:40,459
sort of opacity dragged down.

4557
04:27:53,010 --> 04:27:53,489
Scammed?

4558
04:27:54,290 --> 04:27:54,610
Kind of.

4559
04:27:55,969 --> 04:27:57,090
A little bit, yeah.

4560
04:27:57,090 --> 04:28:07,760
Who's trying to talk to me?

4561
04:28:07,760 --> 04:28:08,930
That's a lot of money

4562
04:28:08,930 --> 04:28:09,729
but I can't go get it.

4563
04:28:12,959 --> 04:28:13,360
Ow!

4564
04:28:13,360 --> 04:28:14,559
I told you I couldn't go get it.

4565
04:28:14,559 --> 04:28:15,760
I told you I couldn't go get it.

4566
04:28:15,760 --> 04:28:16,559
Please put me out.

4567
04:28:20,819 --> 04:28:21,319
No!

4568
04:28:22,209 --> 04:28:29,500
Oh yeah, I got it.

4569
04:28:29,500 --> 04:28:34,579
Well, play Fallout 2.

4570
04:28:35,780 --> 04:28:36,280
No, thanks.

4571
04:28:37,459 --> 04:28:40,829
It's a good game

4572
04:28:40,829 --> 04:28:43,870
but I'm just not really into it at the moment.

4573
04:28:44,670 --> 04:28:46,659
Bubble Spark is my favorite one.

4574
04:28:46,659 --> 04:28:47,299
Vertical Barrier.

4575
04:28:47,299 --> 04:28:48,260
That's a good one.

4576
04:28:48,260 --> 04:28:49,299
Luminous Drill.

4577
04:28:49,299 --> 04:28:50,659
Oh, so what should I get?

4578
04:28:50,659 --> 04:28:51,540
Definitely Bubble Spark.

4579
04:28:52,100 --> 04:28:53,459
Definitely Luminous Drill.

4580
04:28:53,459 --> 04:28:54,579
Definitely Vertical Barrier.

4581
04:28:55,139 --> 04:28:58,399
It tuned down for fuck's sake.

4582
04:28:59,649 --> 04:29:02,739
Time that guy out for like five seconds.

4583
04:29:04,659 --> 04:29:05,700
Thin Vertical Barrier

4584
04:29:06,420 --> 04:29:09,090
that will harm passing creatures

4585
04:29:09,090 --> 04:29:09,729
including you.

4586
04:29:10,290 --> 04:29:14,610
Okay.

4587
04:29:19,649 --> 04:29:20,930
I can put that up in front of me.

4588
04:29:20,930 --> 04:29:22,290
That will cast first.

4589
04:29:22,290 --> 04:29:23,090
Now that's Shuffle.

4590
04:29:24,209 --> 04:29:26,479
And then Bubble Spark.

4591
04:29:27,280 --> 04:29:28,399
And Luminous Drill.

4592
04:29:30,479 --> 04:29:32,290
I don't know what happened.

4593
04:29:41,950 --> 04:29:42,670
It harms you.

4594
04:29:43,860 --> 04:29:44,819
I aimed like...

4595
04:29:46,100 --> 04:29:48,180
What? It puts it like right where you spawn?

4596
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:48,899
Where you're standing?

4597
04:29:55,860 --> 04:29:58,979
I know but I didn't think it was going to like instantly kill me.

4598
04:29:58,979 --> 04:30:00,989
I didn't know.

4599
04:30:00,989 --> 04:30:01,950
I didn't know.

4600
04:30:01,950 --> 04:30:02,590
I didn't know.

4601
04:30:03,229 --> 04:30:04,030
I didn't know.

4602
04:30:04,829 --> 04:30:07,760
It's a static projectile, right?

4603
04:30:07,760 --> 04:30:10,559
But like I thought it was going to be like where I aimed the cursor.

4604
04:30:11,360 --> 04:30:14,020
Like it would place it like in front of me or something.

4605
04:30:14,020 --> 04:30:14,979
Where I put the cursor.

4606
04:30:15,540 --> 04:30:16,659
Not just like right where I am.

4607
04:30:17,459 --> 04:30:19,170
But did it?

4608
04:30:19,170 --> 04:30:19,809
I don't know.

4609
04:30:19,809 --> 04:30:20,690
You cause of death.

4610
04:30:20,690 --> 04:30:21,329
You are dead.

4611
04:30:27,120 --> 04:30:27,920
Oh that's...

4612
04:30:28,879 --> 04:30:30,239
That's unfortunate.

4613
04:30:32,159 --> 04:30:32,659
No.

4614
04:30:33,520 --> 04:30:44,270
Do a mayo making stream tomorrow?

4615
04:30:45,069 --> 04:30:56,850
All right.

4616
04:30:56,850 --> 04:30:57,649
Let's get...

4617
04:30:57,649 --> 04:30:58,290
Let's...

4618
04:30:58,290 --> 04:30:59,729
I need to get back to the...

4619
04:30:59,729 --> 04:31:00,129
What's it?

4620
04:31:00,129 --> 04:31:01,489
The Heesee Temple or something?

4621
04:31:04,020 --> 04:31:05,940
I got there once and then I had one more floor to go

4622
04:31:05,940 --> 04:31:06,819
but it was crazy.

4623
04:31:06,819 --> 04:31:07,700
I couldn't do it.

4624
04:31:07,700 --> 04:31:13,809
I guess you said mayo.

4625
04:31:13,809 --> 04:31:14,850
Now you know what I want right now?

4626
04:31:14,850 --> 04:31:15,889
I just want a turkey sandwich.

4627
04:31:16,610 --> 04:31:18,190
I want a turkey sandwich.

4628
04:31:18,190 --> 04:31:19,549
Thinly sliced turkey breast.

4629
04:31:19,549 --> 04:31:21,979
A layer of nice...

4630
04:31:23,260 --> 04:31:25,659
Nice thick hearty mayo.

4631
04:31:30,930 --> 04:31:34,290
Maybe one just slice of avocado.

4632
04:31:34,290 --> 04:31:36,209
Just a thin slice of avocado.

4633
04:31:38,700 --> 04:31:40,540
Ice piece of like American cheese on it.

4634
04:31:41,100 --> 04:31:41,979
Cheddar cheese maybe.

4635
04:31:42,780 --> 04:31:46,819
He's a big crispy lettuce.

4636
04:31:47,780 --> 04:31:52,059
Or you know how about a chicken cutlet sandwich

4637
04:31:52,059 --> 04:31:53,899
with a big crispy piece of lettuce on it.

4638
04:31:54,620 --> 04:31:54,940
And...

4639
04:31:55,899 --> 04:31:56,540
Squeeze mayo.

4640
04:31:57,180 --> 04:31:57,739
That's all you need.

4641
04:31:58,459 --> 04:32:04,559
I have this theory that people say gross to American cheese

4642
04:32:04,559 --> 04:32:06,000
are people that pretend to hate McDonald's

4643
04:32:06,000 --> 04:32:07,280
and then eat it like three times a week.

4644
04:32:07,840 --> 04:32:22,209
Dude, it's gross.

4645
04:32:24,770 --> 04:32:25,409
Well, I look...

4646
04:32:25,409 --> 04:32:26,370
I didn't say...

4647
04:32:26,370 --> 04:32:27,569
Hey, this is the...

4648
04:32:27,569 --> 04:32:28,690
Of course it's gross.

4649
04:32:29,489 --> 04:32:32,610
But it's still...

4650
04:32:32,610 --> 04:32:33,649
I still like to eat it.

4651
04:32:45,219 --> 04:32:47,709
But why?

4652
04:32:48,350 --> 04:32:50,770
I mean, just because things are a little sloppy

4653
04:32:50,770 --> 04:32:51,649
and a little...

4654
04:32:51,649 --> 04:32:54,290
You know, not the best thing in the world.

4655
04:32:54,290 --> 04:32:56,209
I mean, you don't like to have it from time to time.

4656
04:32:56,850 --> 04:32:59,620
If that were the case,

4657
04:32:59,620 --> 04:33:01,299
the alcohol industry wouldn't exist.

4658
04:33:01,860 --> 04:33:11,569
Portal to someplace.

4659
04:33:11,569 --> 04:33:12,049
Portal lead...

4660
04:33:12,049 --> 04:33:12,290
You do...

4661
04:33:12,290 --> 04:33:13,810
Oh, did you guys just teleport me to the...

4662
04:33:13,810 --> 04:33:14,369
This is the run.

4663
04:33:15,009 --> 04:33:17,819
This is...

4664
04:33:17,819 --> 04:33:18,380
No, it's not.

4665
04:33:18,380 --> 04:33:19,419
I'm taking a ton of damage.

4666
04:33:20,060 --> 04:33:23,470
This is not the run.

4667
04:33:23,470 --> 04:33:24,830
This is not the run at all.

4668
04:33:24,830 --> 04:33:26,669
Like these are all like late game enemies

4669
04:33:26,669 --> 04:33:27,869
that just instantly killed me.

4670
04:33:28,509 --> 04:33:48,479
Stage three is late game.

4671
04:33:48,479 --> 04:33:48,799
All right.

4672
04:33:48,799 --> 04:33:49,520
But hold on.

4673
04:33:49,520 --> 04:33:51,919
Did you see how many people were spawned?

4674
04:33:51,919 --> 04:33:59,299
There's like 12 people around me.

4675
04:33:59,299 --> 04:34:01,549
This is the run.

4676
04:34:01,549 --> 04:34:01,950
All right.

4677
04:34:01,950 --> 04:34:04,110
If I do not get to the floor...

4678
04:34:04,110 --> 04:34:04,430
Okay.

4679
04:34:04,430 --> 04:34:05,310
You ready for this one?

4680
04:34:05,310 --> 04:34:06,990
Ooh, you guys like beds.

4681
04:34:07,549 --> 04:34:08,590
You guys call me the gambler.

4682
04:34:08,590 --> 04:34:10,029
You guys like them a lot more than I do.

4683
04:34:11,169 --> 04:34:13,409
If I do not get to the bottom of this room,

4684
04:34:14,220 --> 04:34:15,659
I will give 100 community subs.

4685
04:34:17,360 --> 04:34:18,479
Of this room here.

4686
04:34:18,479 --> 04:34:29,810
I'm freaking the fuck out.

4687
04:34:29,810 --> 04:34:30,310
Hold on.

4688
04:34:51,540 --> 04:34:53,060
I'm going to shut the fuck up for this one.

4689
04:35:07,250 --> 04:35:55,389
Give me that.

4690
04:35:55,389 --> 04:35:58,990
Give me that.

4691
04:35:58,990 --> 04:35:59,310
What?

4692
04:35:59,310 --> 04:36:00,029
What?

4693
04:36:00,029 --> 04:36:00,529
What?

4694
04:36:08,479 --> 04:36:09,599
They're going to do three.

4695
04:36:09,599 --> 04:36:10,319
They're going to do three.

4696
04:36:10,319 --> 04:36:10,959
I think that's a boss.

4697
04:36:11,599 --> 04:36:12,240
They're going to do three.

4698
04:36:12,240 --> 04:36:12,740
It's a boss.

4699
04:36:18,450 --> 04:36:18,950
Yeah.

4700
04:36:25,569 --> 04:36:26,529
Good game.

4701
04:36:26,529 --> 04:36:27,650
Good game, man.

4702
04:36:27,650 --> 04:36:37,200
Do it again.

4703
04:36:37,200 --> 04:36:41,439
If I don't get to the bottom of the next one,

4704
04:36:42,080 --> 04:36:43,360
I'll give 50 subs.

4705
04:36:43,360 --> 04:36:45,520
It cuts in half every time because I keep winning.

4706
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:58,159
We're going to go now.

4707
04:36:58,159 --> 04:36:59,200
Blast cannon.

4708
04:36:59,200 --> 04:37:00,400
Peace with the gods.

4709
04:37:00,400 --> 04:37:01,200
Or plague rats.

4710
04:37:01,200 --> 04:37:02,240
Peace with the gods.

4711
04:37:02,240 --> 04:37:03,810
I don't know what that means,

4712
04:37:03,810 --> 04:37:05,409
but I just know it's probably not bad.

4713
04:37:05,970 --> 04:37:08,240
I have to go now.

4714
04:37:08,240 --> 04:37:38,150
I can die already.

4715
04:37:38,150 --> 04:37:39,270
Oh my goodness.

4716
04:37:39,909 --> 04:37:46,150
What happened?

4717
04:37:46,150 --> 04:37:46,549
What happened?

4718
04:37:46,549 --> 04:37:47,029
What happened?

4719
04:37:47,029 --> 04:37:47,750
What happened?

4720
04:37:47,750 --> 04:37:48,470
I don't know what happened.

4721
04:37:48,470 --> 04:37:49,750
I have no idea what's going on.

4722
04:37:49,750 --> 04:37:50,470
What happened?

4723
04:37:50,470 --> 04:37:51,029
Why did that happen?

4724
04:37:54,020 --> 04:37:55,459
Oh, they're going to drown me with these potions.

4725
04:37:55,459 --> 04:37:56,900
They're going to do with the fucked up potion thing.

4726
04:37:57,619 --> 04:37:58,819
Hurry.

4727
04:37:58,819 --> 04:37:59,299
Get up.

4728
04:37:59,299 --> 04:37:59,779
Hurry and get up.

4729
04:37:59,779 --> 04:38:00,340
Hurry and get up.

4730
04:38:00,340 --> 04:38:01,139
Get up.

4731
04:38:01,139 --> 04:38:01,459
Get up.

4732
04:38:01,459 --> 04:38:01,779
Get up.

4733
04:38:01,779 --> 04:38:02,020
Get up.

4734
04:38:02,020 --> 04:38:03,060
Get up.

4735
04:38:03,060 --> 04:38:03,779
Get up.

4736
04:38:03,779 --> 04:38:16,659
Scammed.

4737
04:38:16,659 --> 04:38:17,139
You picked it.

4738
04:38:17,139 --> 04:38:17,860
I didn't.

4739
04:38:17,860 --> 04:38:18,659
That's your own fault.

4740
04:38:19,299 --> 04:38:21,270
You should have looked at the fine print.

4741
04:38:21,909 --> 04:38:33,939
Drop it.

4742
04:38:33,939 --> 04:38:37,090
Drop it.

4743
04:38:37,090 --> 04:38:38,049
Safe.

4744
04:38:38,610 --> 04:38:39,700
Drop it.

4745
04:38:39,700 --> 04:38:42,150
Drop it.

4746
04:38:47,360 --> 04:38:48,720
Actual NA aim.

4747
04:38:48,720 --> 04:38:50,000
It's like I seriously...

4748
04:38:52,259 --> 04:38:52,979
That was bad.

4749
04:38:53,779 --> 04:39:03,430
Okay.

4750
04:39:03,430 --> 04:39:04,229
I made it.

4751
04:39:04,229 --> 04:39:05,650
Now it's 25.

4752
04:39:06,369 --> 04:39:10,479
I need these wands.

4753
04:39:10,479 --> 04:39:14,880
I haven't upgraded a wand in like 10 minutes.

4754
04:39:14,880 --> 04:39:17,220
Chunk of soil.

4755
04:39:17,220 --> 04:39:18,659
I can't even buy anything.

4756
04:39:18,659 --> 04:39:25,919
Worm detractor.

4757
04:39:26,639 --> 04:39:27,759
Bomb materialized.

4758
04:39:27,759 --> 04:39:29,439
Electricity immune to electricity.

4759
04:39:30,240 --> 04:39:32,080
A helpful little homunculus comes to your aid.

4760
04:39:32,080 --> 04:39:33,439
Well, you really don't want me to lose, do you?

4761
04:39:38,979 --> 04:39:39,299
Thanks.

4762
04:39:40,020 --> 04:39:42,049
That's down to 25.

4763
04:39:42,049 --> 04:39:42,689
You know it.

4764
04:39:42,689 --> 04:39:43,169
I know it.

4765
04:39:43,169 --> 04:39:43,650
Let's go.

4766
04:39:44,369 --> 04:39:48,689
Here's the remarkable thing about this.

4767
04:39:49,409 --> 04:39:52,450
With me needing to give subs if I lose.

4768
04:39:53,330 --> 04:39:56,209
With the default wand that I got in the beginning of the game,

4769
04:39:56,209 --> 04:39:58,209
I've gotten further than I've gotten in the last hour.

4770
04:39:58,930 --> 04:40:02,319
Give me a break.

4771
04:40:02,880 --> 04:40:05,330
I haven't upgraded one of these wands.

4772
04:40:13,650 --> 04:40:14,049
Easy.

4773
04:40:14,049 --> 04:40:14,610
Easy.

4774
04:40:14,610 --> 04:40:14,930
Easy.

4775
04:40:14,930 --> 04:40:15,490
Easy.

4776
04:40:15,490 --> 04:40:15,729
Easy.

4777
04:40:15,729 --> 04:40:16,610
Easy.

4778
04:40:16,610 --> 04:40:17,970
That's a lot of money.

4779
04:40:18,610 --> 04:40:20,759
Stop spraying that shit.

4780
04:40:20,759 --> 04:40:21,319
I need that money.

4781
04:40:21,959 --> 04:40:23,319
What happened?

4782
04:40:25,590 --> 04:40:27,509
Oh, I took a little extra damage.

4783
04:40:28,229 --> 04:40:31,639
I didn't know you take extra damage when you're...

4784
04:40:33,919 --> 04:40:35,040
There's your 25 subs.

4785
04:40:35,599 --> 04:40:40,790
Hold on.

4786
04:40:40,790 --> 04:40:42,639
Doing it.

4787
04:40:42,639 --> 04:40:43,520
I'm doing it.

4788
04:40:43,520 --> 04:40:47,459
Sub it up.

4789
04:40:49,669 --> 04:40:50,950
It's not 100, but it's 25.

4790
04:40:52,099 --> 04:40:56,599
Pay up.

4791
04:40:56,599 --> 04:40:57,099
Gift.

4792
04:40:58,599 --> 04:41:01,319
Gift 25 subs.

4793
04:41:01,319 --> 04:41:07,319
A custom quantity.

4794
04:41:07,959 --> 04:41:13,060
35.

4795
04:41:13,060 --> 04:41:13,779
Take it or leave it.

4796
04:41:15,349 --> 04:41:15,990
Wait.

4797
04:41:15,990 --> 04:41:17,200
Hold on a minute.

4798
04:41:17,200 --> 04:41:19,119
35 like right now.

4799
04:41:19,119 --> 04:41:20,080
Like start over.

4800
04:41:20,080 --> 04:41:20,959
Double or nothing.

4801
04:41:20,959 --> 04:41:23,040
You got it.

4802
04:41:23,040 --> 04:41:24,709
Let's go.

4803
04:41:24,709 --> 04:41:25,270
50 subs.

4804
04:41:25,270 --> 04:41:25,750
Double or nothing.

4805
04:41:25,750 --> 04:41:26,310
Let's do it.

4806
04:41:26,310 --> 04:41:26,790
Floor one.

4807
04:41:26,790 --> 04:41:30,950
Floor number one.

4808
04:41:30,950 --> 04:41:31,750
Here we go.

4809
04:41:31,750 --> 04:41:33,040
Double or nothing.

4810
04:41:33,040 --> 04:41:42,159
Floor one.

4811
04:41:42,159 --> 04:41:44,000
And by the way, I'm going to make this fair.

4812
04:41:44,000 --> 04:41:44,950
I made this fair.

4813
04:41:44,950 --> 04:41:48,930
I'm not going to move until you guys get to vote.

4814
04:41:48,930 --> 04:41:49,650
Double is 50.

4815
04:41:49,650 --> 04:41:50,150
It is.

4816
04:42:04,099 --> 04:42:06,259
All these options are not very bad at all.

4817
04:42:06,259 --> 04:42:27,020
We have this no summon gigaworm, right guys?

4818
04:42:27,020 --> 04:42:27,580
Slimy.

4819
04:42:27,580 --> 04:42:28,299
Ooh, slime.

4820
04:42:28,299 --> 04:42:30,700
Everyone gets covered in slime.

4821
04:42:30,700 --> 04:42:31,900
No, don't slime me.

4822
04:42:40,119 --> 04:42:41,880
I don't even know what this is, but I'm going to pick it up.

4823
04:42:41,880 --> 04:42:48,500
It's slimed, bitch.

4824
04:42:49,860 --> 04:42:50,360
Okay.

4825
04:42:51,380 --> 04:42:54,709
I don't even know why.

4826
04:42:54,709 --> 04:42:57,270
Like right now, like that didn't do anything to me.

4827
04:42:57,909 --> 04:43:00,810
That doesn't get you closer to the 50 community subs,

4828
04:43:00,810 --> 04:43:03,450
but that person was just so ready to say that.

4829
04:43:04,250 --> 04:43:06,310
Like, yeah, fuck this guy.

4830
04:43:06,310 --> 04:43:07,430
All right, that didn't help us.

4831
04:43:07,430 --> 04:43:08,229
Oh, well, whatever.

4832
04:43:08,229 --> 04:43:09,349
Still, get slimed.

4833
04:43:10,150 --> 04:43:23,240
Okay, hold on.

4834
04:43:23,880 --> 04:43:25,220
Do I have any water?

4835
04:43:26,889 --> 04:43:27,290
Brine?

4836
04:43:27,930 --> 04:43:29,049
That's water, right?

4837
04:43:29,049 --> 04:43:29,610
Salt water.

4838
04:43:40,619 --> 04:43:41,500
Well, don't touch that.

4839
04:43:42,299 --> 04:43:42,860
Don't touch that.

4840
04:43:42,860 --> 04:43:44,299
Don't touch that, you idiot.

4841
04:43:44,299 --> 04:43:55,659
What are these?

4842
04:43:55,659 --> 04:43:57,340
Acid trail, fire trail, transportation, barrel man.

4843
04:43:57,340 --> 04:43:57,900
I don't know what these are.

4844
04:43:59,740 --> 04:44:00,860
I got to get through a safe space.

4845
04:44:00,860 --> 04:44:01,979
A safe place, safe.

4846
04:44:01,979 --> 04:44:02,540
It's not safe.

4847
04:44:02,540 --> 04:44:03,099
That's not safe.

4848
04:44:03,099 --> 04:44:03,580
That's not safe.

4849
04:44:03,580 --> 04:44:04,139
That's not safe.

4850
04:44:04,139 --> 04:44:20,069
Oh, they want a double or nothing again, don't they?

4851
04:44:20,069 --> 04:44:21,509
Want another double or nothing.

4852
04:44:21,509 --> 04:44:22,470
Back to 100.

4853
04:44:24,549 --> 04:44:26,150
That's not how that works.

4854
04:44:26,150 --> 04:44:27,669
Nope, we go down to 25 again.

4855
04:44:33,049 --> 04:44:35,110
Brimstone?

4856
04:44:35,110 --> 04:44:36,069
Summon hollow egg.

4857
04:44:36,709 --> 04:44:41,880
What is brimstone?

4858
04:44:41,880 --> 04:44:43,080
Fiery explosion.

4859
04:44:43,720 --> 04:44:55,720
Does it work on here?

4860
04:44:55,720 --> 04:45:05,060
If you win this one, chat has to give you a kiss.

4861
04:45:06,810 --> 04:45:08,409
Melee immunity.

4862
04:45:08,409 --> 04:45:10,250
Extra health or explosion immunity.

4863
04:45:20,020 --> 04:45:20,500
Let's go.

4864
04:45:21,689 --> 04:45:22,729
Wait, I'm on fire.

4865
04:45:22,729 --> 04:45:24,009
I'm not fire immune.

4866
04:45:24,009 --> 04:45:43,689
Hostile ghosts.

4867
04:45:43,689 --> 04:45:45,369
Okay, watch it.

4868
04:45:46,009 --> 04:45:51,770
Why am I on fire?

4869
04:45:51,770 --> 04:46:05,619
This is such a dog shit setup too.

4870
04:46:05,619 --> 04:46:06,340
I have the list.

4871
04:46:07,290 --> 04:46:08,569
This is so bad.

4872
04:46:08,569 --> 04:46:10,009
This is the worst setup ever.

4873
04:46:10,009 --> 04:46:10,810
I didn't even pay attention

4874
04:46:10,810 --> 04:46:12,250
because I thought you guys were going to drop lava.

4875
04:46:12,250 --> 04:46:12,810
I got to go now.

4876
04:46:13,529 --> 04:46:34,330
Oh, wrong button.

4877
04:46:34,330 --> 04:46:47,849
I win.

4878
04:46:47,849 --> 04:46:49,209
12.5.

4879
04:46:49,209 --> 04:46:50,729
Yeah, back to 12.5.

4880
04:46:52,759 --> 04:46:55,029
12.5.

4881
04:46:55,029 --> 04:47:00,380
Well, it's whittling away down to 12.5.

4882
04:47:00,380 --> 04:47:01,419
Can't even afford any of this.

4883
04:47:01,979 --> 04:47:03,740
But I am going to change this shit

4884
04:47:03,740 --> 04:47:05,259
because I don't want that.

4885
04:47:05,259 --> 04:47:08,389
I want to give myself at least a chance.

4886
04:47:17,349 --> 04:47:18,470
Armed creature.

4887
04:47:18,470 --> 04:47:20,869
Our nearby creature gets a random wand.

4888
04:47:20,869 --> 04:47:25,560
Okay, well, it's good to know.

4889
04:47:25,560 --> 04:47:26,360
Water trail.

4890
04:47:27,939 --> 04:47:29,139
This wand doesn't even have anything on it.

4891
04:47:29,139 --> 04:47:29,860
All right, well, whatever.

4892
04:47:30,580 --> 04:47:32,340
Wait, do I only have?

4893
04:47:32,979 --> 04:47:34,630
What's the best for this?

4894
04:47:34,630 --> 04:47:37,450
0.22, 0.33.

4895
04:47:38,169 --> 04:47:44,340
Terrible mana.

4896
04:47:44,340 --> 04:47:45,220
It's awful.

4897
04:47:45,220 --> 04:47:52,419
0.250, 0.5.

4898
04:47:53,060 --> 04:47:54,009
Hold on a minute.

4899
04:47:54,490 --> 04:48:02,540
Water.

4900
04:48:05,849 --> 04:48:07,529
Ooh, that's cool looking.

4901
04:48:08,409 --> 04:48:12,150
That's not a good idea.

4902
04:48:12,150 --> 04:48:16,840
Okay, I can drown.

4903
04:48:17,560 --> 04:48:18,439
I kind of like...

4904
04:48:18,439 --> 04:48:19,720
Wait, did I just screw everything up?

4905
04:48:23,860 --> 04:48:24,819
Fire immunity.

4906
04:48:24,819 --> 04:48:26,979
Oh, it's over.

4907
04:48:27,939 --> 04:48:30,419
I can just blow myself up down the whole hallway.

4908
04:48:31,139 --> 04:48:41,189
What's the best for that though?

4909
04:48:41,930 --> 04:48:45,689
0.5, 0.5 max mana.

4910
04:48:45,689 --> 04:48:46,569
This one probably, right?

4911
04:48:53,029 --> 04:48:53,750
Bring them on.

4912
04:48:53,750 --> 04:48:54,229
Bring them on.

4913
04:48:54,229 --> 04:48:54,950
Bring the worm on.

4914
04:48:55,509 --> 04:49:19,240
Just dig straight down.

4915
04:49:19,240 --> 04:49:27,479
Okay, I just need to be able to get to the bottom.

4916
04:49:28,200 --> 04:49:36,729
Sniper down here.

4917
04:49:37,529 --> 04:49:38,409
Oh, that was a worm.

4918
04:49:38,409 --> 04:49:38,729
I'm good.

4919
04:49:39,529 --> 04:49:40,919
I just, I need to...

4920
04:49:42,279 --> 04:49:45,900
What do I hear?

4921
04:49:47,900 --> 04:49:48,700
I get down.

4922
04:49:57,240 --> 04:49:58,840
Now you're down to what?

4923
04:49:58,840 --> 04:50:01,479
It's 5.5, 5.6.

4924
04:50:01,479 --> 04:50:16,040
This is the best one because I can just go right down and go...

4925
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:17,639
Hello?

4926
04:50:18,279 --> 04:50:22,069
Where did you come from?

4927
04:50:32,299 --> 04:50:34,060
All projectiles eat the ground?

4928
04:50:34,779 --> 04:50:35,750
I can't even move.

4929
04:50:36,389 --> 04:50:38,150
It sucks.

4930
04:50:38,869 --> 04:50:40,389
This is not even fair.

4931
04:50:41,270 --> 04:50:42,090
Wait!

4932
04:50:42,650 --> 04:51:03,819
Go, go, go, go.

4933
04:51:03,819 --> 04:51:04,060
No!

4934
04:51:06,119 --> 04:51:06,439
What?

4935
04:51:06,919 --> 04:51:11,139
I thought I was immune to explosions.

4936
04:51:11,860 --> 04:51:13,849
I was immune to explosions.

4937
04:51:14,569 --> 04:51:18,680
How am I?

4938
04:51:18,680 --> 04:51:20,040
I was immune to fire and immune to explosions.

4939
04:51:20,040 --> 04:51:21,080
How do I die?

4940
04:51:21,080 --> 04:51:22,939
Blue gas.

4941
04:51:22,939 --> 04:51:25,020
Oh, you're immune to explosions and immune to fire,

4942
04:51:25,020 --> 04:51:26,540
but you can't breathe in a little gas.

4943
04:51:30,069 --> 04:51:30,869
Six subs.

4944
04:51:31,590 --> 04:51:39,209
All right, I'm just going to round it up to 10 because that's like 6.5.

4945
04:51:40,009 --> 04:51:43,419
A droople of nothing.

4946
04:51:43,979 --> 04:51:45,900
50?

4947
04:51:46,470 --> 04:51:47,509
50 and nothing.

4948
04:51:47,509 --> 04:51:48,150
And this is it.

4949
04:51:48,150 --> 04:51:49,430
The last time I'm doing this.

4950
04:51:49,430 --> 04:52:27,799
50 and nothing right now.

4951
04:52:27,799 --> 04:52:28,520
That's bad.

4952
04:52:29,080 --> 04:52:30,599
I already see what it says.

4953
04:52:30,599 --> 04:52:32,119
I'm going to get the fuck out of here now.

4954
04:52:35,770 --> 04:52:37,130
Wait, there's a wand over here.

4955
04:52:37,130 --> 04:52:40,840
Oh, who cares about the wand?

4956
04:52:40,840 --> 04:52:41,720
There's poison everywhere.

4957
04:52:41,720 --> 04:52:42,040
Uh-oh.

4958
04:52:42,040 --> 04:52:42,439
Bad.

4959
04:52:42,439 --> 04:52:44,439
Very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad.

4960
04:52:44,439 --> 04:52:44,680
Go.

4961
04:52:45,400 --> 04:52:46,680
Oh, this is a terrible place for this.

4962
04:52:51,779 --> 04:52:52,099
Shit.

4963
04:52:53,060 --> 04:52:53,700
Oh, shit.

4964
04:52:53,700 --> 04:52:54,979
The world's closing in on me here.

4965
04:52:56,389 --> 04:52:56,869
All right.

4966
04:52:56,869 --> 04:53:07,959
I got a new wand.

4967
04:53:07,959 --> 04:53:08,360
What is it?

4968
04:53:09,000 --> 04:53:10,889
Kind of sucks.

4969
04:53:12,759 --> 04:53:13,560
Chest right there.

4970
04:53:15,380 --> 04:53:15,779
Perfect.

4971
04:53:16,340 --> 04:53:18,180
Pond of money.

4972
04:53:18,180 --> 04:53:18,500
Good.

4973
04:53:18,500 --> 04:53:18,900
Let's go.

4974
04:53:19,619 --> 04:53:30,439
I'm not going to drown.

4975
04:53:30,439 --> 04:53:31,240
Why would I drown?

4976
04:53:35,540 --> 04:53:36,259
Stop moving.

4977
04:53:36,819 --> 04:53:40,919
All right, did I give you guys a chance?

4978
04:53:41,560 --> 04:53:50,919
All right, fine.

4979
04:53:51,479 --> 04:54:19,930
I'll even wait till 10 seconds.

4980
04:54:19,930 --> 04:54:20,729
I want water.

4981
04:54:20,729 --> 04:54:22,169
I don't want this potion.

4982
04:54:22,169 --> 04:54:25,110
Projectiles leave a trail of poison.

4983
04:54:25,110 --> 04:54:26,229
All right, that's fine.

4984
04:54:26,229 --> 04:54:26,950
I don't want this.

4985
04:54:26,950 --> 04:54:27,509
I want water.

4986
04:54:28,229 --> 04:54:35,880
That looks really, really cool.

4987
04:54:36,439 --> 04:54:41,240
Okay, fill it up with water.

4988
04:54:41,240 --> 04:54:48,540
I'm ready.

4989
04:54:48,540 --> 04:54:57,689
I think you guys got scammed.

4990
04:54:57,689 --> 04:54:58,490
Yeah, you did.

4991
04:54:58,490 --> 04:55:09,990
By you.

4992
04:55:09,990 --> 04:55:10,630
What?

4993
04:55:10,630 --> 04:55:13,560
Lower the timer.

4994
04:55:13,560 --> 04:55:14,200
Okay.

4995
04:55:14,200 --> 04:55:17,139
We're going to do something here.

4996
04:55:18,009 --> 04:55:19,770
I'm going to restart after I win

4997
04:55:19,770 --> 04:55:20,569
because I'm going to win.

4998
04:55:21,209 --> 04:55:33,029
See?

4999
04:55:33,029 --> 04:55:35,000
I already won.

5000
04:55:35,000 --> 04:55:36,200
I'm going to give you guys a chance.

5001
04:55:36,200 --> 04:55:37,080
I mean, I just won.

5002
04:55:37,080 --> 04:55:38,360
I mean, it's destroyed everything.

5003
04:55:40,220 --> 04:55:42,540
For a second, I thought that the ceiling was crashing on me.

5004
04:55:42,540 --> 04:55:43,340
All right, you lost.

5005
04:55:43,340 --> 04:55:43,740
You lost.

5006
04:55:43,740 --> 04:55:44,139
It's okay.

5007
04:55:44,139 --> 04:55:45,959
You lost.

5008
04:55:45,959 --> 04:55:47,720
So now what we're going to do is I'm going to change something here.

5009
04:55:48,279 --> 04:55:50,700
I'm going to give you guys one more chance.

5010
04:55:50,700 --> 04:55:55,750
I'm turning the time between votes down to 10 seconds

5011
04:55:55,750 --> 04:55:57,909
and I'm taking the vote time to 10 seconds.

5012
04:56:02,549 --> 04:56:05,939
So let's go.

5013
04:56:10,040 --> 04:56:11,479
I don't think you guys are going to pick that.

5014
04:56:12,119 --> 04:56:16,040
I don't know, but I have to leave immediately.

5015
04:56:16,040 --> 04:56:17,779
This is total chaos.

5016
04:56:18,740 --> 04:56:19,779
I'm ready to fight it.

5017
04:56:20,659 --> 04:56:30,549
This is going to happen very quickly.

5018
04:56:34,659 --> 04:56:37,509
I have to just leave very, very quickly.

5019
04:56:37,509 --> 04:56:38,470
Go, go, go, go, go.

5020
04:56:38,470 --> 04:56:40,950
This, by the way, this is for 100 community subs.

5021
04:56:42,229 --> 04:56:58,150
I'm on fire.

5022
04:56:58,150 --> 04:56:59,270
Stop being on fire.

5023
04:56:59,270 --> 04:57:09,189
How much fucking health do you have?

5024
04:57:23,340 --> 04:57:24,700
You have perks to enemies.

5025
04:57:26,540 --> 04:57:26,860
Shit.

5026
04:57:26,860 --> 04:57:27,419
Okay, I'm good.

5027
04:57:27,979 --> 04:57:28,619
I'm going to be all right.

5028
04:57:29,819 --> 04:57:42,099
I fucking hate those bees.

5029
04:57:42,099 --> 04:57:49,270
What is happening with this?

5030
04:57:49,830 --> 04:57:51,110
I'll leave off the creatures.

5031
04:57:51,110 --> 04:57:53,349
Oh, you guys just saved my ass.

5032
04:57:54,150 --> 04:57:55,029
You saved me.

5033
04:57:55,750 --> 04:58:06,619
You guys really are nice.

5034
04:58:16,220 --> 04:58:17,020
Hostile ghosts.

5035
04:58:17,740 --> 04:58:18,060
Shit.

5036
04:58:18,060 --> 04:58:19,099
Okay, move.

5037
04:58:19,099 --> 04:58:22,659
I'm starting to panic a little.

5038
04:58:24,409 --> 04:58:24,889
Just a little.

5039
04:58:24,889 --> 04:58:26,009
I'm starting to panic a little bit here.

5040
04:58:31,340 --> 04:58:32,139
Shitter leaf?

5041
04:58:42,360 --> 04:58:42,759
Uh-oh.

5042
04:58:45,479 --> 04:58:46,919
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5043
04:58:47,959 --> 04:58:48,200
No.

5044
04:58:49,930 --> 04:58:50,169
No.

5045
04:58:50,810 --> 04:59:02,150
The water saved me.

5046
04:59:02,150 --> 04:59:04,680
If there was no water, I would be dead.

5047
04:59:05,479 --> 04:59:08,580
By the way, why not?

5048
04:59:09,700 --> 04:59:12,099
We're currently no longer on any bets at the moment.

5049
04:59:16,540 --> 04:59:17,580
Hey, you just-

5050
04:59:17,580 --> 04:59:19,659
Skate Tone just killed the fish.

5051
04:59:19,659 --> 04:59:26,520
I didn't do that.

5052
04:59:26,520 --> 04:59:30,500
Five second timer.

5053
04:59:30,500 --> 04:59:32,500
It's the five second timer.

5054
04:59:33,909 --> 04:59:37,270
You guys don't even see it on screen until it's too late.

5055
04:59:38,009 --> 04:59:39,369
It's got to be like 10 seconds.

5056
04:59:44,650 --> 04:59:46,810
All right, this last one is going to be-

5057
04:59:46,810 --> 04:59:47,930
I can't even buy anything.

5058
04:59:52,970 --> 04:59:54,090
I guess I can get this one.

5059
04:59:54,889 --> 04:59:58,389
What does this even matter?

5060
04:59:59,419 --> 05:00:01,020
Okay, if I die here, then-

5061
05:00:01,020 --> 05:00:01,259
No.

5062
05:00:02,060 --> 05:00:07,459
What does worm-

5063
05:00:07,459 --> 05:00:08,740
Worms find you attractive.

5064
05:00:08,740 --> 05:00:09,139
Good luck.

5065
05:00:09,700 --> 05:00:13,159
Okay, here we go.

5066
05:00:13,720 --> 05:00:14,759
If I make it to the bottom,

5067
05:00:15,799 --> 05:00:17,240
if I do not make it to the bottom here,

5068
05:00:18,279 --> 05:00:20,439
then all bets are off.

5069
05:00:27,340 --> 05:00:29,500
A huge body of random liquid?

5070
05:00:32,630 --> 05:00:33,669
What is going on?

5071
05:00:36,470 --> 05:00:37,349
They're on my team?

5072
05:00:41,130 --> 05:00:42,330
Make it 12.

5073
05:00:42,330 --> 05:00:45,209
All right, for 12.5 subs, if I get to the bottom, I-

5074
05:00:46,009 --> 05:00:46,889
I- I don't-

5075
05:00:46,889 --> 05:00:47,369
I don't even-

5076
05:00:47,369 --> 05:00:48,250
I don't know.

5077
05:00:48,250 --> 05:00:49,209
I don't know.

5078
05:00:49,209 --> 05:00:50,090
I don't know.

5079
05:00:50,090 --> 05:00:50,970
I'm confused right now.

5080
05:00:50,970 --> 05:00:51,770
I don't know what's happening.

5081
05:00:52,250 --> 05:00:55,259
Where did I just go?

5082
05:00:55,259 --> 05:00:55,759
Okay.

5083
05:00:56,220 --> 05:00:59,020
What am I spraying?

5084
05:00:59,819 --> 05:01:14,490
Okay, um, I think I'm doing okay.

5085
05:01:15,209 --> 05:01:16,169
Sniper!

5086
05:01:16,169 --> 05:01:20,889
Oh no, I gotta give 12.5 community subs.

5087
05:01:25,430 --> 05:01:31,319
Let's just round it up to 15 so it's easier.

5088
05:01:31,319 --> 05:01:33,000
Times 10 or nothing.

5089
05:01:36,250 --> 05:01:41,450
Oh, that's it.

5090
05:01:41,450 --> 05:01:42,250
Times 10.

5091
05:01:46,279 --> 05:01:48,360
That would be 120.

5092
05:01:52,250 --> 05:01:53,610
No, no, all right, this is it.

5093
05:01:53,610 --> 05:01:59,369
I'm done.

5094
05:01:59,369 --> 05:02:01,689
Here, I'm gonna give 20 community subs right now.

5095
05:02:13,500 --> 05:02:14,779
We'll go in the middle there somewhere.

5096
05:02:14,779 --> 05:02:25,720
Oh, I just gave 20.

5097
05:02:25,720 --> 05:02:27,720
What if we 50x'd that?

5098
05:02:27,720 --> 05:02:40,250
This is no longer even a noisestream anymore.

5099
05:02:40,250 --> 05:02:44,099
This is just gambling for community subs on random shit that I-

5100
05:02:44,740 --> 05:02:45,459
This is not even-

5101
05:02:45,459 --> 05:02:46,659
I'm not even playing the game anymore.

5102
05:02:47,380 --> 05:02:52,540
I- I told you this was gonna happen, too, didn't I?

5103
05:02:53,099 --> 05:02:55,180
I knew this was gonna happen.

5104
05:02:55,180 --> 05:02:58,900
This is why I waited so long to do this,

5105
05:02:58,900 --> 05:03:00,099
because you knew this is what was gonna happen.

5106
05:03:00,819 --> 05:03:02,599
This is a pretty good start, though.

5107
05:03:03,159 --> 05:03:12,580
I can come out alive?

5108
05:03:15,000 --> 05:03:16,360
Nearby things turn into acid?

5109
05:03:17,159 --> 05:03:20,590
Okay.

5110
05:03:21,130 --> 05:03:22,169
Okay, what's happening?

5111
05:03:22,169 --> 05:03:22,650
Why-

5112
05:03:22,650 --> 05:03:23,610
What's- what's happening?

5113
05:03:24,250 --> 05:03:25,659
What is shooting out of me?

5114
05:03:26,470 --> 05:03:27,110
This is bad.

5115
05:03:39,819 --> 05:03:41,419
I never agreed to that.

5116
05:03:41,979 --> 05:03:43,340
I said imagine.

5117
05:03:43,340 --> 05:03:45,259
I said we were done with the betting.

5118
05:03:45,259 --> 05:03:51,479
That's 5,000.

5119
05:03:51,479 --> 05:03:52,360
Yeah, I said what if we-

5120
05:03:52,360 --> 05:03:55,240
I said what if we 50x'd that?

5121
05:03:55,240 --> 05:04:01,400
I didn't say this is 50x'ing it.

5122
05:04:01,400 --> 05:04:02,520
I said, oh, imagine.

5123
05:04:05,819 --> 05:04:07,419
I said no more betting.

5124
05:04:07,419 --> 05:04:09,419
I said it was over after I gave the 20.

5125
05:04:10,299 --> 05:04:12,299
I never agreed to anything, Mr. Nixon.

5126
05:04:12,299 --> 05:04:13,020
No, that's true.

5127
05:04:13,819 --> 05:04:31,020
The house always wins.

5128
05:04:31,830 --> 05:04:32,950
When it feels like it.

5129
05:04:33,590 --> 05:04:36,360
Okay, how about this one, guys?

5130
05:04:37,000 --> 05:04:39,369
This is not me saying imagine, by the way.

5131
05:04:39,369 --> 05:04:40,250
This is me saying that-

5132
05:04:40,250 --> 05:04:43,130
I'm not saying like, oh, imagine if I said, oh, dude, what if it was-

5133
05:04:43,130 --> 05:04:43,630
No.

5134
05:04:44,169 --> 05:04:46,330
If I do not walk in the portal of this room-

5135
05:04:47,209 --> 05:04:51,130
If I do not walk in the portal in this room, I'm-

5136
05:04:51,130 --> 05:04:52,409
Hold on, before I say anything,

5137
05:04:52,409 --> 05:04:54,330
let me make sure I have an opportunity to do that.

5138
05:04:55,369 --> 05:04:56,409
If I do not walk in the-

5139
05:04:56,409 --> 05:04:57,930
Okay, if I don't walk in this portal-

5140
05:04:57,930 --> 05:04:59,209
If I do not walk in this portal,

5141
05:04:59,209 --> 05:05:00,810
I will give 100,000 community subs.

5142
05:05:13,240 --> 05:05:18,840
Okay, the tower didn't come good.

5143
05:05:18,840 --> 05:05:19,799
Look at the map?

5144
05:05:19,799 --> 05:05:22,139
What do you mean, look at the map?

5145
05:05:22,139 --> 05:05:29,080
What map?

5146
05:05:29,080 --> 05:05:33,340
You didn't walk in.

5147
05:05:34,599 --> 05:05:35,799
No, we're not gonna play semantics.

5148
05:05:36,680 --> 05:05:37,560
I went in.

5149
05:05:37,560 --> 05:05:38,520
I walked in.

5150
05:05:38,520 --> 05:05:40,279
You can't play semantics right now.

5151
05:05:45,990 --> 05:05:48,869
If I do not make it down this chute right here

5152
05:05:48,869 --> 05:05:50,950
and live to tell the tale,

5153
05:05:50,950 --> 05:05:53,509
then I will give 500,000 community subs.

5154
05:05:54,069 --> 05:06:01,669
Imagine if I went right into lava.

5155
05:06:05,860 --> 05:06:06,819
Yeah, no more betting.

5156
05:06:06,819 --> 05:06:07,459
No more betting.

5157
05:06:07,459 --> 05:06:07,959
You got-

5158
05:06:08,500 --> 05:06:09,540
Holy shit, this is awesome.

5159
05:06:10,259 --> 05:06:17,849
Help tell-

5160
05:06:17,849 --> 05:06:21,369
Oh, there was a time when I fell down the hole.

5161
05:06:21,930 --> 05:06:24,090
And bet a bunch of community subs and then-

5162
05:06:24,090 --> 05:06:25,610
But it turned out in my favor.

5163
05:06:25,610 --> 05:06:26,169
I won.

5164
05:06:26,169 --> 05:06:26,569
There you go.

5165
05:06:26,569 --> 05:06:26,889
I win.

5166
05:06:27,770 --> 05:06:33,590
Okay, if I do not direct hit the next enemy,

5167
05:06:33,590 --> 05:06:35,990
if I do not hit the next enemy directly,

5168
05:06:35,990 --> 05:06:38,310
then I will give 500,000,000 community subs.

5169
05:06:39,029 --> 05:06:47,939
By the way, I didn't fire a shot yet.

5170
05:06:47,939 --> 05:06:49,779
I just want everyone to be very clear about this.

5171
05:06:49,779 --> 05:06:50,900
I did not even fire a shot.

5172
05:06:50,900 --> 05:06:52,500
I said the next enemy,

5173
05:06:53,299 --> 05:06:56,279
the next enemy that I fire at.

5174
05:06:56,279 --> 05:06:57,319
I didn't say it had to be a lot.

5175
05:06:57,319 --> 05:06:58,119
I didn't say when.

5176
05:06:58,119 --> 05:07:00,759
I just said the next shot, the next enemy.

5177
05:07:01,319 --> 05:07:16,069
I didn't fire a shot.

5178
05:07:16,709 --> 05:07:18,229
I did not say I have to do it in this life.

5179
05:07:18,229 --> 05:07:21,029
I just said the next enemy that I shoot at, I have to hit.

5180
05:07:21,029 --> 05:07:25,619
Or I'll give 500,000,000 community subs.

5181
05:07:25,619 --> 05:07:27,849
How much money is that actually though?

5182
05:07:27,849 --> 05:07:29,130
Like how much actually is that?

5183
05:07:48,099 --> 05:07:50,580
Two and a half billion dollars.

5184
05:08:04,540 --> 05:08:06,700
But I forgot to say after that,

5185
05:08:06,700 --> 05:08:09,340
that community subs in Germaland.

5186
05:08:10,220 --> 05:08:12,540
It's a new game that I have coming out soon.

5187
05:08:12,540 --> 05:08:13,979
It's a new game where we sit here

5188
05:08:13,979 --> 05:08:17,180
and we pretend that we're all part of a giant world.

5189
05:08:17,180 --> 05:08:19,819
And I give two and a community sub in Germaland

5190
05:08:19,819 --> 05:08:23,979
is a one quarter of a tenth of a quarter of one tenth

5191
05:08:23,979 --> 05:08:25,979
of one quarter of one cent.

5192
05:08:25,979 --> 05:08:29,259
So if you do the math out in this new Germaland,

5193
05:08:34,810 --> 05:08:36,650
I forgot to add that to the end of that.

5194
05:08:36,650 --> 05:08:39,610
It's 2.5 billion dollars.

5195
05:08:44,279 --> 05:08:46,200
Imagine thinking I had even.

5196
05:08:46,200 --> 05:08:47,720
Oh, that's so fucking funny.

5197
05:08:48,680 --> 05:08:49,720
I was so scared.

5198
05:08:53,880 --> 05:08:57,319
Streamer O's chat, two and a half billion dollars.

5199
05:08:58,040 --> 05:09:00,040
No, but I forgot to put the amend, the, the, the,

5200
05:09:00,040 --> 05:09:01,319
the amendment there.

5201
05:09:01,319 --> 05:09:04,200
That this is where in the German 985 funland

5202
05:09:05,159 --> 05:09:10,040
and on German funland, every dollar is worth

5203
05:09:10,040 --> 05:09:12,040
a quarter of a tenth of a cent of a penny

5204
05:09:12,040 --> 05:09:14,360
of a quarter of a penny of a quarter of a cent.

5205
05:09:14,360 --> 05:09:16,360
So, I mean, it's kind of like when you're on the moon.

5206
05:09:17,240 --> 05:09:21,259
It's kind of like when you're on the moon

5207
05:09:21,340 --> 05:09:22,779
and the gravity is like different.

5208
05:09:22,779 --> 05:09:23,900
It's kind of like that.

5209
05:09:23,900 --> 05:09:25,419
I'm in Germaland right now.

5210
05:09:25,419 --> 05:09:26,700
So this is like my rules.

5211
05:09:26,700 --> 05:09:27,500
I'm in my own land.

5212
05:09:27,500 --> 05:09:29,419
It's a quarter of a tenth of a quarter of a percent.

5213
05:09:29,419 --> 05:09:32,860
So, 2.5 billion dollars.

5214
05:09:32,860 --> 05:09:35,259
Turns out to actually be where I am here.

5215
05:09:35,259 --> 05:09:37,700
When you do the conversion here, it turns out to be,

5216
05:09:38,259 --> 05:09:40,419
it turns out to be another, another 20,

5217
05:09:40,419 --> 05:09:41,779
another 50 community sub.

5218
05:09:45,220 --> 05:09:45,700
There you are.

5219
05:09:45,700 --> 05:09:47,540
So I, I didn't tell you that.

5220
05:09:57,080 --> 05:09:58,520
Imagine if like, all right.

5221
05:09:58,520 --> 05:10:00,040
We like, obviously we're making.

5222
05:10:00,680 --> 05:10:02,680
I, hey, but wait a second.

5223
05:10:03,319 --> 05:10:04,759
Hold on a minute, folks.

5224
05:10:04,759 --> 05:10:06,040
Hold on just a minute, folks.

5225
05:10:06,680 --> 05:10:07,959
Wait just a second here.

5226
05:10:08,979 --> 05:10:13,509
I did say that all the bets were over

5227
05:10:13,509 --> 05:10:14,549
and there was no more betting.

5228
05:10:14,549 --> 05:10:15,909
And this was all just for fun.

5229
05:10:15,909 --> 05:10:17,110
I said there was no more bets.

5230
05:10:17,110 --> 05:10:17,669
I said that.

5231
05:10:17,669 --> 05:10:18,470
I said it was over.

5232
05:10:18,470 --> 05:10:19,909
We're not doing bets anymore.

5233
05:10:19,909 --> 05:10:20,950
So that was a fun one.

5234
05:10:20,950 --> 05:10:22,310
That was a joke one.

5235
05:10:22,310 --> 05:10:29,540
I did say that beforehand.

5236
05:10:29,540 --> 05:10:31,540
I did say, I did say, all right.

5237
05:10:31,540 --> 05:10:32,740
We're not doing betting anymore.

5238
05:10:32,740 --> 05:10:33,380
No more bets.

5239
05:10:33,380 --> 05:10:35,939
And then I said, oh, 500 million subs, right?

5240
05:10:35,939 --> 05:10:36,740
Like that was a joke.

5241
05:10:36,740 --> 05:10:38,419
It was a, it was like joke in Funnyland.

5242
05:10:41,380 --> 05:10:48,040
Semantics Andy.

5243
05:10:48,040 --> 05:10:50,200
No, I did say, I said bets are over.

5244
05:10:50,200 --> 05:10:51,479
We're not doing bets anymore.

5245
05:10:51,479 --> 05:10:53,880
And then I made like a joke or like a comedy thing.

5246
05:11:06,200 --> 05:11:17,049
Oh, my chest is killing me.

5247
05:11:17,049 --> 05:11:22,169
Imagine losing, imagine losing a two and a half billion dollar bet with your chat.

5248
05:11:25,259 --> 05:11:27,180
Oh, my fucking chest is killing me.

5249
05:11:40,900 --> 05:11:42,900
Look, obviously this is like just a joke, right?

5250
05:11:42,979 --> 05:11:43,939
Like it's just for fun.

5251
05:11:43,939 --> 05:11:50,650
But if I did, if I gave 500 million community subs, that would mean that each one of you

5252
05:11:50,650 --> 05:11:56,700
would have, would get, would get like there's 8,700 people here.

5253
05:11:56,700 --> 05:12:02,169
If each one of you got an equal portion of that, like each one of you would be getting

5254
05:12:02,729 --> 05:12:14,950
like 650,000 subs worth of time on the channel.

5255
05:12:14,950 --> 05:12:17,750
That's like 7,000 years.

5256
05:12:18,939 --> 05:12:19,819
Oh, my God.

5257
05:12:19,819 --> 05:12:20,540
That's so funny.

5258
05:12:20,540 --> 05:12:21,040
All right.

5259
05:12:21,979 --> 05:12:22,700
Double or nothing?

5260
05:12:23,590 --> 05:12:24,229
Double or nothing.

5261
05:12:24,950 --> 05:12:27,909
I will give, I will give five billion community subs.

5262
05:12:27,909 --> 05:12:29,349
Double or nothing if I don't get the bottom.

5263
05:12:32,220 --> 05:12:32,900
Double or nothing.

5264
05:12:32,900 --> 05:12:33,900
Five billion subs.

5265
05:12:34,540 --> 05:12:50,470
That's official.

5266
05:12:50,470 --> 05:12:51,189
That's official.

5267
05:12:51,189 --> 05:12:52,549
Five billion community subs.

5268
05:12:52,549 --> 05:12:53,110
That's official.

5269
05:12:53,669 --> 05:12:55,779
Double or nothing.

5270
05:12:55,779 --> 05:13:16,299
I don't go...

5271
05:13:16,299 --> 05:13:23,810
I don't, there's, I don't.

5272
05:13:23,810 --> 05:13:24,349
Oh thank God.

5273
05:13:24,349 --> 05:13:25,270
Thank God.

5274
05:13:25,270 --> 05:13:25,669
I've won.

5275
05:13:25,669 --> 05:13:26,150
I went.

5276
05:13:26,150 --> 05:13:27,470
No, I don't have to get 500 billion.

5277
05:13:27,470 --> 05:13:28,869
I'm going to get five billion communities.

5278
05:13:28,869 --> 05:13:29,349
All right.

5279
05:13:29,349 --> 05:13:30,470
How about triple or nothing?

5280
05:13:30,470 --> 05:13:32,389
I get 30 billion community subs away.

5281
05:13:41,779 --> 05:13:42,340
All right.

5282
05:13:42,340 --> 05:13:42,979
That was official.

5283
05:13:42,979 --> 05:13:44,979
That was if I double enough that that was official

5284
05:13:55,979 --> 05:13:57,979
Dollars that's so fucking funny

5285
05:13:58,860 --> 05:14:06,099
Oh, I'm so glad that I like doubled or nothing and I officialed it and I like that's it. It's been stamped

5286
05:14:06,740 --> 05:14:12,500
It's only official if he wins

5287
05:14:13,939 --> 05:14:21,020
No, I told you I I am gonna compromise i'll compromise to give you the the currency value of the germa 985 currency

5288
05:14:21,580 --> 05:14:23,580
Which is 50 community subs?

5289
05:14:24,180 --> 05:14:26,659
It's a tenth of a quarter of a quarter of a tenth of a quarter of a

5290
05:14:26,740 --> 05:14:29,139
quarter of a tenth of a quarter on a frog in a log in the bog in the bottom

5291
05:14:29,220 --> 05:14:32,520
Of the sea worth of a cent. It's 50 community subs

5292
05:14:39,400 --> 05:14:43,819
Pay up what no I closed out that transaction

5293
05:14:50,380 --> 05:14:52,860
Oh the no. No, I when I paused the game and I said, oh no

5294
05:14:53,020 --> 05:14:53,740
Here's what we're gonna do

5295
05:14:53,740 --> 05:14:58,139
I'm gonna we're gonna go through the we're gonna go previously to the tenth of a quarter over tenth of a percent of a tenth

5296
05:14:58,220 --> 05:14:59,099
Of the quarter

5297
05:14:59,099 --> 05:15:17,369
Let's do 50 community refreshing

5298
05:15:17,369 --> 05:15:20,889
That's a tenth of a quarter over tenth of a percent of 10th of the quarter of a 10th of the frog in the log of the

5299
05:15:21,209 --> 05:15:23,369
Bog of the border the phalaea and the hair of the log in the bottom of the sea

5300
05:15:23,369 --> 05:15:40,819
Here we go.

5301
05:15:40,819 --> 05:15:47,659
Devil or nothing? No! I told you already. I told you already before we even did the 500 million. I said I've done no more bets.

5302
05:15:47,659 --> 05:15:58,150
It's over. I said that and it was very clear. I said anything going forward is just a fucking comedy routine.

5303
05:16:04,590 --> 05:16:26,020
Five billion subs. No one even has that much money. Chat is enabling Jerma's gambling addiction.

5304
05:16:26,340 --> 05:16:35,509
Only four only 499 million 999 thousand.

5305
05:16:41,709 --> 05:16:51,869
Wait, I want to see official 30 billion. I'll get 30 billion community subs if I- If I what? If I what?

5306
05:16:53,000 --> 05:16:55,000
Excuse me, if I what?

5307
05:16:56,790 --> 05:17:04,409
Excuse- I'll get 30 billion community subs if I- If I what? Didn't even say anything there.

5308
05:17:04,409 --> 05:17:11,020
I could fall- I could have fall- all right, that was official. That was- I double enough that that was official.

5309
05:17:11,380 --> 05:17:18,459
That was official. The thing that I just did was official. I never told you what we were betting on.

5310
05:17:21,549 --> 05:17:33,220
I'll get 30 billion community subs if I- if I- and I said it was official the last one which was double to nothing and then

5311
05:17:33,220 --> 05:17:37,090
this is it. I didn't say what- if I what? I could have said if I even fucking Oreo.

5312
05:17:37,090 --> 05:17:41,209
That was official. That was- I double enough that that was official. That was official. I double nothing that was official.

5313
05:17:41,209 --> 05:17:53,299
All right, see why I don't want to turn this fucking thing on in the first place. All right, turn this- turn it off!

5314
05:17:53,299 --> 05:18:18,040
I'm doing a- I'm doing a run on my own. I still- I think that's so funny.

5315
05:18:18,360 --> 05:18:29,619
And here's the worst part about that. It had to be the bouncy one.

5316
05:18:29,819 --> 05:18:36,209
If you watch that clip, it literally bounced if we were in a tiny corridor and it bounced

5317
05:18:36,209 --> 05:18:41,040
bong bong bong bong bong bong bong bong around the guy a hundred times.

5318
05:18:41,040 --> 05:18:54,509
Everyone doesn't love- what? What are we minus twoing? What? It's fun to gamble without consequences, isn't it?

5319
05:18:54,509 --> 05:19:03,779
I mean, yeah, because like, well, you- what? Do you think- do you think I would like actually put up a five hundred million dollar bet?

5320
05:19:03,779 --> 05:19:12,169
Put it back. Wait, wait. What is this? What are you guys linking?

5321
05:19:13,979 --> 05:19:18,020
One-fourth of-

5322
05:19:20,750 --> 05:19:36,650
No, no, you didn't listen closely. No, you didn't listen close enough. That's not what this is. You didn't listen close enough.

5323
05:19:41,880 --> 05:19:50,040
One-fourth of one-tenth of a quarter of a percent is fifteen thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars.

5324
05:19:57,470 --> 05:20:01,189
No, I said you didn't hear me. You misheard me.

5325
05:20:02,439 --> 05:20:05,200
I'm crying right now. You misheard me.

5326
05:20:05,200 --> 05:20:10,159
I said one-fourth of one-quarter of one-tenth of one-quarter of one-tenth of a frog in the log of the bog of the

5327
05:20:10,319 --> 05:20:12,319
pay at the bottom of the sea.

5328
05:20:13,080 --> 05:20:38,750
Somebody said, what is this? Chowder? What's chowder? How much is a frog in the log on the bottom of the sea?

5329
05:20:38,950 --> 05:20:46,639
That's the part that you're not calculating. A frog on the log on the bottom of the sea is like a dollar.

5330
05:20:46,639 --> 05:20:53,720
Oh, it's one-fourth of one-tenth of one percent of a dollar.

5331
05:20:54,200 --> 05:21:06,590
Oh, my fucking back hurts right now from laughing at this. A dollar you haven't paid? I get fifty community subs.

5332
05:21:06,590 --> 05:21:10,349
That's the back, right? I can't fucking believe I missed the shot.

5333
05:21:10,869 --> 05:21:22,970
Stop! I don't need to see the math.

5334
05:21:29,270 --> 05:21:35,549
I don't know why this is so funny to me because like I'm just thinking if like somebody like I'm just thinking if somebody really like

5335
05:21:35,630 --> 05:21:37,630
actually made that bet.

5336
05:21:47,180 --> 05:21:49,180
Oh, this is killing me.

5337
05:21:58,099 --> 05:22:01,380
Okay, I have to stop. I gotta go. I think I actually have to.

5338
05:22:02,259 --> 05:22:10,970
What does this have to do with anything?

5339
05:22:12,169 --> 05:22:14,169
Seriously, what does this have to do with anything?

5340
05:22:15,930 --> 05:22:19,319
What does this have to do with anything?

5341
05:22:35,319 --> 05:22:38,580
What does this have to do with money?

5342
05:22:38,580 --> 05:22:54,240
What? Is that your opportunity to link that? Oh my god.

5343
