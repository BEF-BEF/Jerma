1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:14,070
Is it mercenary or mercenary? Is it M-E-R-C-E-N or C-A-N? Is it mercenary or mercenaries? Mercenary,

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:29,929
right? Yeah, yeah, with an E. I had it right. No, no, no, no, hold on. It's M-E-C-M-E-R-C-A-N?

3
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:42,780
Whatever, I don't care. It's merc- mercenaries? Mercenary. No, it- my phone's not telling me it's

4
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:52,619
wrong. I'm just waiting. Mercenaries. All right. Hello. Hi. Welcome, everybody. Welcome back.

5
00:00:52,619 --> 00:01:00,859
Hope you had a good weekend. Welcome back to the stream. Today, I guess you just heard it,

6
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:08,890
we're going to be playing Mercenaries 2. There's a funny story about this one. This is on PC.

7
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:15,260
Didn't want it to be on PC. I wanted it to be on PlayStation 3, but unfortunately,

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,109
I couldn't get this game to get- I couldn't get my PlayStation 3 to get captured. I was trying to

9
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:27,370
capture my PlayStation 3 and it wouldn't work anymore. I don't know what happened. We played

10
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:33,829
the Olympics game, like, 12 days ago, right? Like, last week? A week and a half ago? What happened?

11
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't know- I don't know what happened. I was trying to figure this out for, like,

12
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,859
a fucking hour. I was supposed to start an hour ago. I was ready- I was here ready to go.

13
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,379
I don't know why I wouldn't get captured. It was- no, not- it- not the- I mean, I streamed from

14
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:56,620
this exact setup 12 days ago. I didn't change anything. Was there a Windows update or, like,

15
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:05,099
an OBS update within the last 10 days? It- something got fucked up. I've no- yes,

16
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:16,360
there was. Okay. Of course. There was a PS3 update. There was a Windows update, like,

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:26,150
five days ago. Okay, I think- I think we may have found the culprit then. What are they even doing

18
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,479
anymore? Can we just talk about this very briefly? What the fuck are they updating? What are they

19
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,120
even doing? Like, the operating system is- just works. Just fix- what else could you be adding?

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,960
Okay, I understand, like, security holes, right? Fix the security holes and, like, fix the bugs.

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,740
But, like, I don't give a shit about any of the new features you add. You know what I've been

22
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:03,219
sitting on the Windows, like, update? There's, like, a features. Windows features. Please install me.

23
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,099
It's been, like, a year and a half. I'm like, no, fucking get out of here. I don't want you.

24
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:16,860
I don't know what it adds. What does it add? Like, yeah. Let me see what it adds. I'm curious.

25
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,819
I want to read it. And I'll tell you if any of these things are things that I would ever use.

26
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:39,110
Okay, let's see. What does it got? Okay, learn more. Okay, this one. This is for, uh, okay.

27
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:53,689
Great news. What's new? Here we go. Troubleshooting. Wait, there's only a troubleshooting list.

28
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,460
Hey guys, here's the new Windows update. Here's what it adds. It breaks everything,

29
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:13,080
and here's a list of how you fix it when we break it. Windows 10 versions. Okay,

30
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,000
Windows 10 versions 1909 and 1903 share a common core operating system and an identical set of

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,740
system files. As a result, the new features in Windows 10 were included in the recent monthly

32
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,720
quarterly update for Windows 10, but they're currently in a dormant state. These new features

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,920
will remain dormant until they are turned on using an enablement package, which is a small,

34
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:44,379
quick to install master switch that simply activates Windows 10. What? Why do they have

35
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,980
like a dormant ancient creature that's being built into the Windows 10 update? I'm not going to

36
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:01,100
enable that. I don't want this Cthulhu fucking update on my computer. No, just fix the security

37
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:20,790
bugs. Anyways, an Eldritch update. An Eldritch update. That's so perfect. I'm not enabling that.

38
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,990
No, I don't want that. I don't want a dormant fucking Microsoft computer monster on here.

39
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,750
And then they just like they turn it on one day and like break your computer.

40
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:38,740
Why does there have to be a master switch? It feels like it shouldn't be there. It feels

41
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:46,300
like they shouldn't like turn on a master switch. All right, we're going to play Mercenaries 2.

42
00:05:46,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Let's go. I already hear like explosions. Okay, here we go. Can you see it? Does

43
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,720
German not know how Windows works? I know how Windows works. I just, I don't,

44
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:12,870
I don't want all that shit. And I know everyone just says, dude, just use, just use Linux. It's

45
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,589
okay. Everything I ever hear about Linux or like any of the Linux operating systems, it's just,

46
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:23,110
hey, it's, it's just like way better. From my understanding, you've got Windows is like the

47
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,029
Best Buy computer that you buy off the shelf and it has like fucking Norton 360 on it already.

48
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,509
Right. But Linux is like you built it yourself and there's no bullshit on it. Is that how I

49
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:44,120
understand this? But the unfortunate thing is everything is made for the Best Buy computer.

50
00:06:46,730 --> 00:07:00,980
So a lot of times you have to have the Best Buy computer. I know I don't want to play online,

51
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:11,819
play online. Wait, I have to pick my character. Um, I can't see the other characters. Okay.

52
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:23,720
Matthias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs or Jennifer Mew. How do I see the, I want to see them.

53
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:52,579
Oh, okay. Hmm. Jennifer duh. What do you mean duh? I like the cigar. I do like the cigar. I'm a,

54
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:59,139
I'm a, I'm a big cigar fan. I've, I've never smoked one. Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer,

55
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:22,329
Whoa. All right. Jesus. But Chris has a cigar. All right. It's done. Wait, runs faster. Hold on.

56
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:34,860
Okay. Which one of these guys has punches harder? Regenerates health faster. Hmm. Carries more ammo.

57
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,379
All right. Runs faster is, I feel like, all right, that's probably pretty good.

58
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,809
Jen to only to her friends is the most expensive mercenary on earth. If it seems like she focuses

59
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:52,250
on money and nothing else, it's because she focuses on money and nothing else. Okay.

60
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,639
Kind of a big fan so far. She finds it amusing that there are people dumb enough to think

61
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:09,669
that anything else is important. Is there, is this, is this like a video game? Is it like a cut scene

62
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:15,830
or is it just throw like grenades at stuff? It's probably low, but whatever. I'll be quiet.

63
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:44,379
This. You should have done the same. Oh, I got paid. I always get paid. I need your

64
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:51,080
guns. No one sees the boss. I feel like this is a machinima made in the sims. Jennifer,

65
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,320
this is Ramon Solano. Mr. Solano is the richest man in Venezuela. I can tell we're going to get

66
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,559
along perfectly. What's the contract? Last week, general Carlos Caramona and his soldiers attempted

67
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:13,080
a coup. It's made by EA. Oh shit. It is some great plan for general Caramona and his army

68
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,539
plans for Venezuela. So it's me against a bunch of VZ soldiers. That's it. Will you accept the

69
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:27,480
contract? As long as your checks don't bounce. I feel like I'm going to really like this game.

70
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,460
Is that the case? I've never played this either of them. Welcome to Venezuela,

71
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,980
Solano's paperwork. So we're good to go. Packed into a CIA satellite.

72
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,379
I can see you and most of the area around you. I'm working off a laptop connected to a cell phone

73
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,980
here. So don't expect miracles. Leave the miracles to me. 2008 cell phones in the right direction.

74
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:56,009
This is like iPhone four. You're literally coping. What? Oh shit. Okay. Here we go.

75
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,330
Accelerate. What button is that? How do I land on a bunch of

76
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:10,809
pointy rocks? Okay. Steer and then break. What are those? What are those? Objective added.

77
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:18,539
Land on the beach. Okay. But what, what buttons are those? Okay. It's obviously A and then what

78
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:38,700
is B? Break? No, B is horn. Land on the beach. How do you exit? Wait, do you drive cars? Wait a

79
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,460
second. Wait for a weapon delivery. Melee bash is use melee bash to open crates.

80
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:55,899
Punch. Oops. What's made? I already like it. I love it already. I don't mind getting a little

81
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:05,210
dirty. Okay. What's in here? There's nothing in there. Equip grenade launcher. How do I pick it

82
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:19,159
up? Did I get it? I did. I don't think I picked it up. Oh boy. This is not, I don't think this is a

83
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:35,620
controller game. I don't think this is a controller game. Let me see. Why are there no ammo stores

84
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:47,299
around here? Why do I zoom in? Right. Hold on. Right. Stop. Okay. Wait. Right mouse button doesn't

85
00:12:47,299 --> 00:13:00,070
zoom in? What the hell zooms in then? Shoot reload. Why? You've given me like Minecraft pictures.

86
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:10,779
What's the button that I have to press? Zoom. Switch weapons. Yeah. How? How do I do that?

87
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:25,429
Q? Hold on. Okay. Mouse one. Primary switch tab. Reload is R. Secondary attack mouse two.

88
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:37,539
Secondary switches V. Melee attack F. Use E. Jump space. Crouch C. Binoculars B. PDA F1. Lookup I.

89
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:46,549
A. Support. Walk. Switch. What's zoom in? Sprint is left shift. Okay. But what is the

90
00:13:47,269 --> 00:14:01,610
zoom in? Mouse two. I'm pressing mouse two. Wait. It's crouch. Sensitivity has got to go

91
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,570
way down too. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I like playing with the controller. Hold on.

92
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,500
Joystick sensitivity. Here we are. I want to play the controller. I don't want to keyboard and mouse.

93
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:21,820
I hate that. All right. Let's try that. All right. That's way too slow. But you get the idea.

94
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:45,620
Yeah. This is much better. That was not good. That was very bad. Oh, it shot. All right. Oh,

95
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,580
okay. That's how you equip it. That's a little too low though. Way too low. Way,

96
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:59,340
way, way, way, way. I think that's going to be good. This game was wild as a kid. You played

97
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:14,279
this as a kid? Open PDA is the pause button. It's the select button. This is a great kid's game.

98
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:24,539
I don't think I agree. Okay. Destroy the gate. Thank God there's a fucking fallout New Vegas map.

99
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:41,210
What do I do? How do I blow it up? Do I have to switch weapons? All right. Let's go. Dude,

100
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:48,460
you know what? Okay. My up and down sensitivity is crazy. Open support menu. Use support item.

101
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:14,379
Wait, satellite guided satellite mom. One for free. How do I use it? Use support item. Oh shit.

102
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:31,320
Okay. Over the target. Confirm. Confirm target. Do it. Go. Did I do it? Okay. There it is. Confirm

103
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:41,690
target is. Okay. Got it. Oh, it's a mini game. Oh shit. All right. Run, run, run. Get out of here.

104
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:55,419
I mean, let's be honest. You would do the same shit. It doesn't matter how like hard you think

105
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:59,980
you are. If this an explosion that far behind you, you're not going to be like, yeah. No,

106
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:12,519
you're going to be like, Jesus. I'm glad that that happened. Oh fuck. Look out. All right. How do

107
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:37,420
you sprint? How do you crouch? Okay. Don't want to die in the tutorial. Uh, I have an idea.

108
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:54,230
So soft. Got them. Did I get them? Your AK is freaking out. Get to the way point.

109
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:14,059
Holy shit. That was pretty good. Come on. Dude, do you get cars in this game?

110
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:26,220
Tell me you get a car. Do you get a car? Yes. Okay. I'm, I'm, I'm incredibly excited. Wait,

111
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:33,579
vehicle delivery, vehicle delivery. Where is it? Dropped out of the sky.

112
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:47,619
See if it was going to crush me. Drive the iguana. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

113
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:59,130
Drive. Where am I driving? That is a full letter grade. That is a full letter grade. That's what

114
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:14,819
happens. Okay. We go back down here. Went from F to a D. Um, no, it went from a C to a B.

115
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:27,660
All right. Now it's, wait, now it's a B minus. Now it's a, now it's a B plus. Okay. I just had to

116
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:36,809
see what happened. You can actually do it. Okay. You can, you can ghost ride cars. Did I get them?

117
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:57,299
Oh, I didn't get them. I thought I got them both. Where's the car? Where did it go? Did it keep

118
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:11,339
going? Okay. This blend. I thought this was part of the rocks. There's a handbrake. How do I do it?

119
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:21,349
Okay. That's it. Excellent. I love spending other people's money.

120
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:39,500
Okay. She turned into a hermit crab. Why am I still alive? Okay. Open up the menu.

121
00:20:40,220 --> 00:21:13,180
Satellite guided bomb. Where is it? All right. Take it out. Got it. Tank. Give me that ammo. Oh,

122
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,410
wow. Level destruction. Yeah. That's cool. All right. Let's go. Let's get in the tank.

123
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,930
How many different vehicles are there? Is there a motorcycle? This is a motorcycle.

124
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,089
This game's automatically an A minus. Steal it or nuke it. What do I mean? Yeah. Get in it.

125
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:54,569
How would I destroy this? Um, okay. But move, steer, shoot. Oh God. This game is fucked. This

126
00:21:54,569 --> 00:22:10,019
game is mega fucked on PC. Is it? I can't, it's hard to turn. It's mega fucked on PC. What do you,

127
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:30,950
is that going to be a problem? Switch weapons. How do I switch weapons? I'm trying to do it.

128
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:43,720
Switch weapons. Oh, there we go. This just sounds like popcorn in the microwave.

129
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:57,740
I gotta make it realistic. Hold on. Do I take it out yet? Do I take it out yet? No, not yet. Okay.

130
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,779
No, that's fine. That's fine. Let's get it out. Get it out now. Get it out now before it explodes.

131
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:13,740
Anybody else have that irrational fear? You don't have that irrational fear.

132
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,420
You know, you're supposed to count two seconds between pops. If it's longer than two seconds,

133
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:31,720
then like, I, I feel like there's a risk of explosion. Get to the way point. Wait,

134
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:43,299
hold on. Can I just like, why would you stand up there? Okay. If you're this guy, don't you

135
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:52,950
dive off now. Why would you continue to stand up on this? These are houses. Wait, but there's

136
00:23:53,029 --> 00:24:20,490
people shooting at me. Okay. That was, it was pretty fucked up. All right. Let's go the right

137
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:41,109
direction. Bridges out. Oh, sweating. Bridges out. Get inside the complex. How about we just blow it

138
00:24:41,109 --> 00:25:01,769
up? Just take it out from over here. Why is it healing? Don't worry. They'll come out. Don't

139
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:14,839
worry. We'll smoke them out. Can you destroy everything? Wait, why is it being rebuilt?

140
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,589
This is just like when you're destroying a building in Warcraft and the guy puts like

141
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:29,269
10 peons on it and you're just like, get these fucking things out of here.

142
00:25:30,069 --> 00:26:23,500
Oh, what's this? Wait. Oh, wait, where is this? Did I do it? What happened? Mission complete.

143
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:33,400
Wait, was this supposed to be a hideout? Oh, where's the rest of your team? I'm the complete

144
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,220
package. So you're a merc. He knows a good deal when he sees it. Let's get the hell out of here.

145
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:48,819
Jennifer, welcome back. Job well done. Just like old times. Me doing all the work, you nowhere to be

146
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:54,259
seen. Is somebody really mad that they don't have the premier project file anymore? To be

147
00:26:54,259 --> 00:27:00,660
able to re-render these in HD, like full 1080. First I get paid. I'm sorry. The job is not for

148
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:09,559
you. The job is you. Tomorrow, General Carmona's troops will roll into the capital and I will be

149
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,880
Venezuela's new leader. You should have just paid me the money. I love money. This means there will

150
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,279
be many bounties on my head. I can't have your friends hunting me. It's bad for business. So is

151
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:29,319
this. Now I have to kill you. Sorry, Jennifer. You piece of- Why is it, why is it bleeped?

152
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:42,420
That wasn't even a bleep. That was like a phone touch tone. Why did she do that? Oh my God.

153
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:55,619
That was what the after the beep. If you like leave a message for somebody. Jen, please sit

154
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:01,220
down if you can. She got shot in the ass. Trust you to be looking at my ass. We're leaving Venezuela

155
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,740
tonight. That was ridiculous. I can't even process what just happened. That was fucking crazy. It's

156
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,779
not safe because I'm here and I am pissed off. Yeah, no one shoots her in the ass and gets away

157
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,819
with it. He didn't pay her the worst thing it could have done. I'm being told now that Ramona

158
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,170
was giving a press conference. This is a crack game. Yeah.

159
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:47,539
Everybody pays Blanco. I don't know. Whatever. What am I saying? Everybody pays. I blinked and she

160
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,740
kicked a guy in the balls from behind. I didn't even see the cut scene. I felt like I just had a

161
00:28:52,740 --> 00:30:21,720
dream. What? Okay. So I'm trying to piece this together. Okay. I don't know why, but I thought

162
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,559
that was that guy. Director Cameron Brown. I was like, all right, this guy, this is a

163
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:33,500
solid snake. Metal gear snake. Whatever. Wait, you can steal cars? No, you can't. No, you can't. No,

164
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:44,950
you can't. You can't do that. No, there's no way. This is you can't, right? Can you get hit by cars?

165
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:55,109
Kind of. There's a motorcycle. Okay. There's a motorcycle in the game. Okay. It's an A minus.

166
00:30:55,109 --> 00:31:15,640
Give me this thing. Oh yeah. Holy shit. Okay. I have to have fun. All right. Give me that

167
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,440
motorcycle bike. This is, this is too much stimulation. There's another one right here.

168
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:42,519
We'll take this one. Wait, is that bike? There's two bikes here. Wait, can you punch? Why is a

169
00:31:42,519 --> 00:32:05,400
bike still driving by itself? What? I'm getting battlefielded? Wait, they have a out of bounds

170
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:13,240
like battlefield. All right. How do I? This is a first person mode too. This is amazing. All right.

171
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:22,519
I'm going to do first person driving. How am I getting shot at by? Wait, what's that? Money?

172
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:45,190
How is he still alive? I feel like I'm an animal. Like I'm a wild fucking animal.

173
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,259
Just put like fucking screaming like bear noises right there. Wait, I didn't get the money.

174
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:11,980
Police academy. What do you mean police academy? Wait, I think I know what you're talking about.

175
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:32,339
Okay. No, no. What's, what is it? Um, naked gun, the naked gun movies. Wait, there's a bad guy.

176
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:52,470
What's this? Oh, $25,000. All right. That's not a bad guy. Did I get everything? All right. Wait, how

177
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:08,619
what is this? Oh, requires a helicopter pilot to steal. Are you kidding me? Wait, what?

178
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:21,429
I have to do a mission. I'm going to lose my mind.

179
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:41,420
All right. We're gonna bang a left. Don't kill people. I've, what are you? I'm being shot at.

180
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:48,730
I do want a motorcycle though. That's way cooler. Will this guy fly over the handlebars?

181
00:34:49,690 --> 00:35:16,139
No. Why would you turn into me? I'm not killing anybody. I want a bike though. I want a bike.

182
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:48,710
Give me the bike. Why is this thing on ice? No, get. There we are. Come on. Let's go. All right. I

183
00:35:48,710 --> 00:36:27,769
want the other camera angle. Oh shit. Wait, turn left. All right. Turn left. I almost got it. I

184
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:38,780
almost got it. I just had to drive as fast as I could. Wait, how do I open this gate? Open the

185
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:44,760
gate. What did I just get a little jump for? That was cool. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

186
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:57,260
wait, wait, wait. Get a real car. Oh shit. There's a temporal disturbance. I'm pulling you out. I'm

187
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,139
pulling you out, Jen. No, don't do it yet. I'm not ready. No, you've been in there for too long.

188
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:24,809
What do I do? I can't get in. I don't have access to an airstrike. I don't. It's not. I don't have

189
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:46,409
an airstrike. I need a car. Use a grenade. Use a van. I don't have any grenades. I don't have any.

190
00:37:47,050 --> 00:38:00,420
All right. I'm going to take that car. There's a car right here. Use your head. I've tried that.

191
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:30,980
It didn't work. All right. Car. Give me. All right. Open up. You actually had to drive through it.

192
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:42,219
You got to be kidding me. Okay. But it was like a little scavenger hunt. Is this supposed to be a

193
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:52,099
maze? I found it. Wait, I have to kill that guy. Did I get him? That guy had an elaborate setup.

194
00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:07,320
Is he dead? I got him. All right. Imagine being that guy. Yes, I'm going to hide in the

195
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,349
elaborate maze that she will never find me. Boss, she's driving through the hedges.

196
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,539
Somebody, when they write about this in the history books, make sure you said

197
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:39,500
it took her at least two minutes to find me. Why did I just hacky sack that into the air?

198
00:39:40,139 --> 00:40:00,300
Take ammo. Take ammo. We're out of here. Wait, what was that? I want a grenade. I'm going to

199
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,389
sneeze and I'm going to try to be very, very, very. I'm back. Hi guys. Welcome to the stream.

200
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:11,110
Today we're going to play Mercenaries 2. I have nine grenades. I do have nine grenades.

201
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:52,119
I didn't even realize that. Is this like Dora the Explorer? Oh, come on. All right. Watch this.

202
00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:00,250
Here I. Oh, come on. Really? I thought the whole thing was going to come down.

203
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:36,440
Do you see? Do you see where Jen went? Nevermind. I tried. All right. There he is.

204
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:52,789
Wait, that's an explosive thing. Isn't it? Is it? Oh my God. That guy. That guy was like,

205
00:41:52,789 --> 00:42:10,809
Holy shit. It didn't get me. Machine pistol. Oh, he just took him right in the lip. All right. I

206
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:22,789
got him. I need a car. What's this? Oh, $55,000, man. What else is back here? All right. Like,

207
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:34,219
give me that car behind that cover. Yes. Nice throw, dude. Okay. That was pretty good though.

208
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:48,659
Can I just drive through the wall? This is the most efficient way to mow the lawn.

209
00:42:49,460 --> 00:43:06,710
Just throw a grenade. All right. Where is he? Right here. Another maze guy. No. Oh, party's over.

210
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:13,800
Party's over. Yep. Party's over, guys. Why am I sinking into the ground?

211
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:45,460
Where is he? Holy shit. You are horrible. You sucked. Oh, fire. Why is there fire? Let's go.

212
00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:02,440
Don't shoot that. Don't shoot that. I need that. I need that. Do not. Thank you. Don't blow that up.

213
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:23,269
Get out of my way. Get out of my way. I need that. Are you serious? I need this. Not going to work.

214
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:36,260
Not going to work. Whatever. Who did he throw that at? They didn't throw it at me.

215
00:44:36,900 --> 00:45:11,579
Wait, that's money. I need that. Just shoot. What? Give me that money. That's a lot of cash.

216
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:22,739
$85,000. Behind the tree. Behind that wall. Behind that car. Behind that thing. Behind that

217
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:51,340
structure. Was this two people or is that one person? What? Why are they dead? Okay. Go to the

218
00:45:51,340 --> 00:46:04,500
front entrance. They can't swim. It's always so funny in games where you can't swim. Where water

219
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:13,860
instantly kills you. It doesn't cause any blood. It's like a poison. It's an instant poison.

220
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:24,300
It's like getting electrocuted. Water is electricity. Oh my goodness. You dick. I

221
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:31,960
needed that. I want your thing. Give me that. Like an acid pool. Yeah. Okay. Wait. RPG. Nice.

222
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:43,670
So much fun. Check this out. I can't blow the... I got to go to the front of the... Can I go on

223
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:54,860
the side of the building? Wait. That's going to take way too long. Never mind. Is there another

224
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:05,269
car I can take? There we go. Yeah. I've got my tried and true. My trusty. Important. This game

225
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:16,550
has a manual save. If you die, you go to the beginning. What? Oh my God. Thank you for saying

226
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:37,829
that. Why did you tell him that? I'm so glad you did. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't

227
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:57,159
shoot. No. The same fate. The same fate as the last one. All right. I made it. Now what?

228
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,159
Inside the villa. All right. I got one shot. Wait. Can I destroy everything?

229
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:29,690
All right. I'm going to destroy the statue of Michelangelo. What's going on? We good?

230
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:41,420
Any resistance inside? There's kind of a tank in here. Okay. Get close to the tank turret.

231
00:48:43,110 --> 00:49:03,159
Hijack the tank. Oh no. Okay. Whoa. Hijack. That was weird. I just kind of fell through the ground.

232
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:18,070
Behind that tank. Go to the courtyard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want a motorcycle in here so bad.

233
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:35,159
Behind that thing. Behind that building. That does it for the estate ground. I'm seeing some

234
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:42,969
activity inside the villa. All right. Hijack the tank. All right. I got $115,000.

235
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:51,050
Do you buy new weapons and shit in this game? This is, I'm going to like this. This is going

236
00:49:51,050 --> 00:50:04,139
to be a lot of fun. Okay. I'm ready. Got it. Is there any resistance inside? There's kind of a

237
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:40,170
tank in here. Come back over here. Come here. What is the sound? The music stopped.

238
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:57,559
Okay. I just wanted to see what happened. I'll get it instantly. Ready? Count to one. One. I don't

239
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:08,119
want to hijack this. I don't think that's what would happen. Destroy the

240
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:33,849
entourage. Is the plane part of it? Die. Die. She's the last guy. Right there. All right. So

241
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:49,099
do I leave? All right. So we go up the stairs. Destroy the statue. We don't have time. No,

242
00:51:49,099 --> 00:52:03,019
no, no, no. The statue stays. That was Harry Potter music. Kind of. Yeah.

243
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:18,519
Huge oil company. They own all the derricks in the area. By someone named Ruben. Yeah,

244
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:27,610
Lorraine Ruben. Do you know where Blanco is? Look at that. She deals with Blanco. And if we find

245
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:36,340
Blanco, we find Solano. All right. We got to find Blanco. Is that a casino?

246
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:52,380
Uh-oh. Ready to get to work? We can talk about how we make contact with Universal Petroleum.

247
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,300
Also, it might be a good idea to practice some of your basic combat skills now that

248
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,139
we have a base of operations. I can help you with both of these. Oh.

249
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:09,960
Implaced weapons challenge one. Let's do it. I know you hate target practice, but I know you

250
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:16,119
love losing money. I mean gambling. Oh. Not without a friendly wager to your normal routine.

251
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:23,590
Okay. That's a magic word. All right. Here's a simple wager between you and me. I've set up

252
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:28,710
an emplaced weapons challenge on the PMC grounds. You use the weapons to blow up targets before the

253
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,789
time runs out and you win. Destroying the cars during the challenge will pause the timer.

254
00:53:32,789 --> 00:54:23,880
Wager a thousand. Let's go. Where's the last one? Where's the last statue? Where is it?

255
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:38,150
All right. Shoot the cars. Move to the recoilless rifles and shoot cars.

256
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:59,900
What? Oh, I gotta do it in the air? Shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. God damn it.

257
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:52,260
Damn it. What's the travel time on this thing? Shit. Shit. Oh. Now what? He sucks. He does not

258
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:59,860
suck. Move to the grenade launchers. I've got two minutes and 48 seconds. All right. Move to...

259
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:28,599
What? Where is it? What do I have to destroy? There's nothing else to blow up.

260
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:47,449
What? It's a hundred thousand dollars that is made. It's the easiest hundred thousand I've ever made

261
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:53,530
in my life. Like that's the easiest hundred K ever. I had a full three minutes. I have to...

262
00:56:53,530 --> 00:57:04,139
That's like... Come on. Grenade launcher challenge level one.

263
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:17,130
Grenade launcher course for you to be. Use the launcher to blow up the targets. You can

264
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:27,480
only fire from behind the sandbag. Let's go. He's addicted. All right. Let's go.

265
00:57:37,530 --> 00:58:03,780
Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.

266
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:12,389
What? Last one, right? All right. Two minutes. I got plenty of time.

267
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:46,940
Oh shit. I have one shot left. What? What do I have to do? Destroy statues? What statues?

268
00:58:46,940 --> 00:59:13,530
Where are they? I don't understand. It's behind them? It's splash damage. Okay. Splash damage.

269
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:24,329
Oh shit. There's another one. I did it. That's a hundred fucking thousand more dollars.

270
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:44,360
Save the game. Quick. Pistol level one. All right. Hold on. Let me save it.

271
00:59:44,920 --> 01:00:00,900
So I get like a million dollars? Another one. Stop gambling Gary. All right. I'll do pistol

272
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:14,679
challenge and that's it. Pistol course. Shoot down all the Solano portraits with your pistol. Remember

273
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:22,070
you can only fire from behind the sandbag. Let's go. Just retire. I haven't even done one mission

274
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:28,539
yet. All right. How do I beat this? What does it have to swim underneath this?

275
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:50,360
Okay. How do I get up there? Wait. What's going on? Wait. Am I bugged out of the map?

276
01:00:54,539 --> 01:01:04,539
This is not fair. This is a huge disadvantage. Do I have to swim to the shore? I'm only going

277
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:22,309
to have one. All right. Right here. I've got to be quick. I'm swimming further down. I can't shoot

278
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:57,829
from here. Medivac. Wait. I lost a hundred and ten thousand. Now that's bullshit. That's

279
01:01:57,829 --> 01:02:09,860
absolute horse shit. I'm not going to stand for that one. I'm not standing for that one.

280
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:24,090
Why am I going so fast? Where's my money? How much money do I have? There we go. All right. Wait.

281
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:35,690
This is like a thing. Wait. Can I buy clothes? No outfits found. How do I buy them? All right.

282
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:39,929
Is the game running at sixty FPS and the game is not running times two speed? Am I going crazy

283
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:52,599
or what happened here? No, I don't care. Let's go. I'm doing the mission now. I got three hundred

284
01:02:52,599 --> 01:03:02,780
and fifteen thousand universal petroleum. I've done some research on that American oil company

285
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:08,059
that Blanco is involved with. They're called universal petroleum. Before Solano took over,

286
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:14,139
they had exclusive rights to drill for oil and only gave the Venezuelan hyper fast game even

287
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:23,190
faster. Oh, by the way, just to make sure everyone knows August 23rd is the last day

288
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:30,949
you can submit for the DLC movie night. And then that stream is going to be on the 29th.

289
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:35,590
Solving some problems for UP senior executive here, Dr. Lorraine Rubin,

290
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:42,650
should show them how much more useful we can be. So far, there are about four hundred videos.

291
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:49,699
So it's going to be wild. It's four hundred of them. We still have to go through the origin,

292
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:56,340
the first wave of vetting them, but I have to imagine it's not going to be too far from like

293
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:03,699
350, 360 or something. I don't know. Or omega well, omega well. Yeah. All right.

294
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:13,130
Steel guns. Return the shipment to the up HQ. Five hundred dollars a gun. That's nothing. I

295
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:24,219
could make a hundred thousand dollars in five seconds. Well, this is not looking good.

296
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:36,599
Am I just going through the sewers? Am I going to open up underneath this guy's toilet?

297
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:53,860
With your PDA, you need to be looking at your PDA to set the GPS.

298
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,019
Well, I'm having a little bit more trouble, lady.

299
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:23,619
No, I'm trying to get back up to the surface. Stop talking to me for a second. OK. Beacon,

300
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:36,019
place. Good. Now you can follow the GPS. Thank you. There's got to be a way I can get up here,

301
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:40,139
right? It has to. All right. I'm going to go this way. Get away from the house.

302
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:52,570
I feel like I can probably swim up that. Am I making any progress? I think so.

303
01:05:53,130 --> 01:06:02,170
Swim to the bottom of the world. I don't think there's a dive. You have to find a pool and swim

304
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:12,090
up. I don't want to do that. Oh, no. Do I have to go find it? Oh, that's not good. Oh, don't give me

305
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:18,730
those things to do because I'm going to do them. I actually have to find a pool in the town and

306
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:37,369
swim up the pool. Is there a body of water over here? There's a pool in the backyard. There's

307
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:47,829
one at the villa. It's too late. OK, there's no more water right here, so it's going to force

308
01:06:47,829 --> 01:07:02,219
me up onto the land, isn't it? That's false. No, Omega-Lel, no. There's no more water to swim in.

309
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:20,280
Wouldn't it just push me up through the earth? No, it'll push you down. Oh, my God. Where's the

310
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:31,059
fucking pool? Where is it? Lock your frames? I mean, if the frames are locked at 60, should I

311
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:50,260
lock it to 30? Lock it to 30? Oh, but that's ugly. Let me see if I can go up here. Is this the pool

312
01:07:50,260 --> 01:08:24,039
right here? This looks like water going straight up. I just want to climb up this. OK, I'm almost

313
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:40,649
there. All right, now go up. No? Just pull me out. Don't forget to stock up on fuel and support.

314
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:48,100
Retry? Yes. All right, come on. Don't drop me in the water again. There we go. All right, we're up.

315
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:56,340
We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're good. We're up. Look, I made $300,000.

316
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:04,250
It's OK if I lose 10. Steal a truck. Yep. Open that PDA. Set a route. You guys say route or you

317
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:21,899
guys say route? What do you guys say? I say route. Thank you. So, what are these two

318
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:32,250
whistle things? Go back in the water. You missed a secret. I don't care. All right, I need a

319
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:41,399
helicopter pilot to get this stuff. Fine. You call a router a router? No, but if you have a route,

320
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:47,340
you have a route. Like, it's either one works. They're both phonetically correct in English.

321
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:16,380
NA wording. No, they both work. They're both right. They're both correct. Stop! Are there police in

322
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:38,489
this game? I don't think there is. There's no star system, right? Follow that person. No,

323
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:49,500
I want to do the mission. Whatever. I want the bike, but I can't get the bike. You know what I

324
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:56,779
mean? You're a maniac. I'm so glad there are bikes. I can't wait to go off a sick jump.

325
01:10:56,779 --> 01:11:19,590
They spawned in. That's not my fault. Like a glove. I just bumped him. He's all right.

326
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,180
Give me that. I want a motorcycle. There's so much fun. I love driving around in like GTA

327
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:32,229
type games with motorcycles. I'm going to get it. Oh, are you still on it?

328
01:11:49,180 --> 01:12:07,289
I love it. You can just go up on one wheel. Ow. Right up here. And then I do have to steal the truck.

329
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:35,619
Right. Okay. Give me the truck. Not the right truck. Can you get in the canoe? Cargo value.

330
01:12:35,619 --> 01:13:06,970
All right. All right. I need to go up here. Harry Potter. Stop. Don't bang up the truck. MCU music.

331
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:23,210
Why did he do that? He was trying to flip me.

332
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:39,989
I'm not going to have anything left. 1.5 thousand. Are you shitting me?

333
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:04,149
Okay. Need at least $500 of cargo. Let's go. I got it. I got it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

334
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:11,239
This is fun. This is fun. He's going to keep the shit in the back. Oh, this is a cool car.

335
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:31,270
That hurt me. This is a fucking Cadillac. All right. Not going to mess it up. So I'm

336
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:46,600
going to try to get as many as I can. Like I can pull it off with like movie wire.

337
01:14:47,399 --> 01:15:04,810
That was a matrix scene. What happened? I know. I look, I did it already. I'm already a full step

338
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:18,060
ahead of you. Dammit. I was trying to hit the guy in the head. I will get like a headshot with

339
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:31,699
a bike. I promise you at least once. All right. Cargo. All right. Let's be easy. I'm going to try

340
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:42,439
to get as much as I can here. Why would they just be loose in the back? You can't wrap these up

341
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:54,810
like Saran wrap or something. Where's the bungees to hold these things down? Put a tarp on it. Yeah.

342
01:15:54,810 --> 01:16:00,310
That's what I mean. Like tie a tarp down behind here. All this loose shit. You never should

343
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:06,920
carry anything like this. But you always drive by that guy in the highway that's got like a

344
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,920
fucking mattress with one bungee on there. And he's going like 40 miles, like 30 miles per hour

345
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,079
in the highway. It's like, dude, you can't take a back road. Like what the fuck are you doing?

346
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:31,779
How much is in there? There's still $500. Push it. Can't move.

347
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,409
God damn it.

348
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:03,210
All right. Well, it's this guy. This is a deliberate sabotage guy drives across the whole thing.

349
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:07,449
And he tries to, he just murders you, just drives into you from the side.

350
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:22,600
How does it feel to get sabotaged? I feel like that happens quite frequently.

351
01:17:31,829 --> 01:18:07,800
I want to go the other direction. Okay. Here we go. Oh, go, go, go. Okay. Do not let the guy

352
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:24,149
in the Mack truck smash into the side of the car. I gotta be the guy in the highway going 30

353
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:39,239
out of the way. All right. When does it happen? And he comes right from the left side.

354
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:48,869
Truck joke incoming. No truck joke, not incoming. This is where truck joke truck. I can't even say

355
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:57,560
here it comes right here. He drives over here. What was that? Did I go over a bump? There it is.

356
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,800
All right. He's waiting. He's waiting. He's waiting. This is like an online player.

357
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:12,069
Fuck you, buddy. Not going to happen. Yup. See you later. Watch out for grenades. Now I've got to

358
01:19:12,069 --> 01:19:14,949
hold on. I got to take an alternate route. I don't want to go straight up the front.

359
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:21,560
All right. We're going to go this way. We're going to turn good. Okay. Now we're going to bang left.

360
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:54,140
We're going to, we're avoiding that huge barricade. Is that water? Okay. All right. Hey,

361
01:19:54,859 --> 01:20:11,220
okay. We're good. I did it. I got $9,000. One of the guns spawned outside the truck.

362
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:22,010
That's unfortunate. Sneak through here. It's okay. It's all right. How do I have 31 health?

363
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:49,260
Okay. Here it is. $9,000. Exit the vehicle. Thank you. Return guns to contract me bonus. $9,000,

364
01:20:49,260 --> 01:21:05,239
$9,000. I think it's shooting at me. Didn't I just do a mission for them?

365
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,300
Is the head Ruben in there? Didn't I just do this with these guys?

366
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:23,020
Why are they doing this? I'm a dipshit. I was, they were just lighting me up.

367
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:36,199
Wait, I shot at the truck. Yeah. And the cut scene, that doesn't count.

368
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:41,819
I found your missing guns. Now I'd like to talk to Dr. Ruben.

369
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:48,119
The name's Mui. Your boss wants to speak to me. All right. You're the mercilano shot in the ass.

370
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:57,220
Hey, you know what she's got? Tim times gave $50. Thank you, Tim times. That's a huge amount of money.

371
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:05,430
Say thanks for all the laughs. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. Dude. I'm listening.

372
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,829
We need you to retrieve. That's fucking crazy. Classified tech. Can't say much.

373
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:22,779
Loving every laugh. Laughing about it. Okay. Action up. The up mercs want a favor before opening the

374
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:33,300
gate. Retrieve their one of a kind vehicle. The Devastator. 25,000. Let's do it. Am I going to

375
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:57,430
have aggro on these guys for the rest of the game? Shit. Okay. Well, it's just the guys outside,

376
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:08,539
right? It's just the guys outside. We're fine. They're not firing. Yeah. They just, they just,

377
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:23,829
they're just angry. All right. Who do I have to talk to? So I don't have to be here.

378
01:23:41,989 --> 01:23:59,500
Where is it? That's it. It's X to reverse. That's me.

379
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:32,470
I'm so excited. What? I need to reload. You have got to be kidding me.

380
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:50,520
This isn't funny. This is the Devastator. Okay. You're my hero. So I have to take this fucking thing?

381
01:24:51,319 --> 01:25:04,890
Where? This is 25 grand. That means you have to ride the little pink bike.

382
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:19,260
Get out of here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Laugh it up. Nice bike. Huh? None of you

383
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:27,989
dickheads could do what I just did. Everybody just shut their fucking mouth immediately after

384
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:39,380
seeing that. So this is just like, haha, you have to go get this dumb, embarrassing bike.

385
01:25:40,100 --> 01:26:11,560
You're doing, I have it. It's okay. Let's move please.

386
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:37,399
$25,000. One of them is, you know, can I just kill one of them? Don't shoot them. Don't shoot

387
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:44,899
them. Don't shoot anybody. Oh wait, I can go in here. Do not attack anybody in here is what you're

388
01:26:44,899 --> 01:27:17,930
saying. Don't do that. Wait. Enemies sighted. I'm sorry. I mean, you got the enemies here.

389
01:27:18,729 --> 01:27:24,739
She's in the car. What are you doing? Why did he just do that? Why did he just do that?

390
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:48,899
Why did he just do that? You psycho. Oh, he's too smart. He got out. Yeah, he did get out. Outplayed.

391
01:27:57,289 --> 01:28:01,609
I can't help it. I love these games. This is so much fun. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I have

392
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:12,149
to go. Ow. What's the X? What's that mean? X, X, X, like a bar filling. What does that mean?

393
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:39,659
Skies as a voice suspicion to keep your disguise up. Open up. All right. I'm going to save, save,

394
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:46,180
save. Oh, shit. You're being completely unreasonable. There's over 2000 people here.

395
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,579
How can we possibly get this? All right. There's almost 7000 people here. You got it a little wrong.

396
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,100
You got the most expensive haircut here. You must be in charge. You're the

397
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:01,300
mercenary my security people call me about. My name's Marie. Well, I'm glad you're here.

398
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:07,619
This presents a fantastic opportunity. Why are these not right? Universal petroleum. Sure.

399
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:11,939
I'm Dr. Ruben. What a little costume. Anything you need, I can provide. I'm here with only one

400
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:17,220
instruction. Keep the oil flowing. I'm empowered to use any of the all methods. You met with someone

401
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:23,060
I'm looking for. A former mercenary. They call Blanco. I'm familiar with him. When Solano has

402
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:31,479
bad news for us, he sends Blanco. This is really bad stage production. I just memorized my fucking

403
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:37,399
lines and I'm just going to say them. Hopefully you get yours right too. Let's hear it. Arrested

404
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:42,840
strategy of corporate disincentivization. His men kidnapped my marketing VP, Victor Contreras,

405
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,920
and are threatening to kill him. I don't think Solano's men are particularly bright. They call

406
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:52,039
me regularly from Victor's cell phone. I'm going to loan you my helicopter. Damn it.

407
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,920
It even has Sims music.

408
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:10,630
I can't follow any of that. I have no idea what just happened.

409
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:17,479
Um, okay. These ethugs have kidnapped a universal petroleum executive.

410
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:23,909
Use the provided helicopter to support, to deliver listening posts and then we can track the

411
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:37,659
kidnappers. Oh yeah. Then rescue the hostage $500,000. Is he pretending about the FPS? No,

412
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:43,000
I liked it. I don't want it to be 30. I, it's fine.

413
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:59,479
The first thing you'll have to do is set up three, set up listening posts.

414
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:05,079
I've identified the best places for the listening posts.

415
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:10,649
Okay. Deliver listening posts. We're going this way first.

416
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:19,140
Holy shit. Something just exploded. Save game. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I got it. I got it. I got it.

417
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:29,750
Increase the FPS. Universal petroleum helipilot in the air and ready for your signal.

418
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,710
This is going to get hairy Devlin. You ready to dodge air fire?

419
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:38,949
Holy shit. The helicopters just flew into each other. What the hell is going on up there?

420
01:31:38,949 --> 01:31:40,710
Did you see that? Wait a minute.

421
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,539
An alarm has activated. Give me a break. Blaster bomb.

422
01:32:06,789 --> 01:32:34,500
Ow, my head. Okay. I'm going in. What I have to do, listening posts, listening post delivery.

423
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:44,779
Right here. Get in the X wing.

424
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:53,979
One of the most satisfying noises in all cinema history is the quack, quack.

425
01:32:54,779 --> 01:33:32,069
Fucking landed on my feet too. Jesus. Where is it? I know I was going on the roof,

426
01:33:32,069 --> 01:33:43,260
but then they blasted me off. What happened to it? It's gone. What? I'm so confused. Why is it gone?

427
01:33:53,020 --> 01:34:12,060
Good. Good, good, good. All right. I'm almost there. What? He's looking over there like,

428
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:18,220
oh no. Oh shit. Oh, that's not good. It's not good. Oh, it's okay.

429
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:35,000
Listening port. Hello. Let's do it. No shit. Did I do the wrong spot?

430
01:34:38,420 --> 01:35:02,649
Switch secondary weapon C4. What is this? All right. Did I turn it on? Do I need that?

431
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:13,880
Do I need that? Somebody tell me. Do I need that thing? Yes, I do. Is it fall damage?

432
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:22,180
Is it fall damage? Yes or no? Fall damage? I need that. It's on the other side of the

433
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:50,409
fence. Fuck. I got him. Buster bomb. What do I do with it? How do I use it? What? What did I just do?

434
01:35:51,289 --> 01:36:20,439
Wait, what? Where's the C4 that I threw? It's somewhere over here. I think it exploded.

435
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:24,600
It doesn't matter. I don't even need it. Oh my God. Just go, go, go, go, go. Get in, get in,

436
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:46,600
get in, get in. Good drive. Okay, Ren. Stevie, I'm going to kill you. Switch secondary weapons

437
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:53,020
to equip C4. That's going to be on the screen forever, I think. How do I get that off the screen?

438
01:36:53,819 --> 01:37:10,229
How do I get out of here? Equip it? I don't know how to equip it. Switch secondary weapons to equip

439
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:20,819
C4. But I already, I equipped the C4 and I threw it over the cliff. What's going on with this

440
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:59,720
helicopter? Grapple. How do I grapple? I need a grappling hook. What? Right back up. What the

441
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:11,659
hell are you talking about? Whoa, what's this? Collect spare parts. That's $200,000 but no reason.

442
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:36,060
All right, here we go. Right on the beach. It's listening post two. Increase the FPS. I can't.

443
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:57,319
There's no increasing FPS. Get a guy on the turret. Will he get on? Okay, there's one right there.

444
01:38:57,319 --> 01:39:04,659
Just take it. I gave you that one. Take that one. All right, make sure your aim is good.

445
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:15,060
You're just shooting up into... All right, well, I didn't even know. I think you aggroed those guys.

446
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:43,619
Money. No, I don't want it. I can't even take it. Come on in. Get it. Get him. Shoot, shoot, shoot,

447
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:51,619
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Shoot him. Shoot him down, please.

448
01:39:53,079 --> 01:40:09,960
Shoot him down. Get him. Enemy tank? Oh, you got him. You got him. Good, good, good.

449
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:55,850
Shoot that tank. Steal it. Steal it. Get him. Did he have a ball gag in his mouth? What was that?

450
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:14,180
What was in his mouth? What the hell was that? Wait, I think I... The whole building just came

451
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:25,989
down. Oh, shit. Okay, I'm ready. Use... Listening. Listening. Grenade. Active.

452
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:46,979
This game is literally times two speed. Is it? Is it really though? Like, is it actually?

453
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:09,880
I can't... I cannot change this. This is not changeable. All right, one more.

454
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:29,399
I'm blowing this place up. Look, it's a red thing. How could there be two of you in here?

455
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:38,520
How many people are in there with a rocket launcher? Why does every window have a guy

456
01:42:38,520 --> 01:43:18,890
with a rocket launcher in it? Turn on V-sync. Change their voices. No, it's the same, right?

457
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:44,310
Yeah, it's the same. I have a deadline. Move. Like, I'm just complaining about the humidity.

458
01:43:44,949 --> 01:43:56,619
Now it looks like it has a Snapchat filter on it. It's... Now it's worse. Hold on. Wait, is it worse?

459
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:14,810
I can't change the refresh rate. It won't let me. Put it on four three. Why would I make it four

460
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:28,699
three? Don't stand in the road, dude. Don't shoot at me. Going to advanced. I don't think I can

461
01:44:28,699 --> 01:44:35,300
change this, guys. Advanced. Water effects. Particle level. Motion. Yeah, none of this

462
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:53,659
means anything. Please add me back on Snapchat. No. All right, here we go.

463
01:44:55,449 --> 01:45:00,279
V-sync is off again. Yeah, because everyone hated it. All right, this one should be easy.

464
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:31,210
Oh, give me that tank. Three out of three. I got it. Okay. Yeah, I'm destroying this building.

465
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:34,729
This is the guys with the rocket launchers hang out in here. What's in there?

466
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:45,699
Okay. Building destroyed. Wait, what's all this blinking for?

467
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:55,659
Rocket launcher storage.

468
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:16,060
What? Kill the executive? No, no, go. Hijack kidnapper's vehicle and save the...

469
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:25,399
Shoot the... I'm not going to shoot the old lady. Stop.

470
01:46:32,649 --> 01:46:45,289
Oh, that's a good guy. Wait. What's a 200 fucking thousand dollars?

471
01:46:46,729 --> 01:47:18,409
All right, give me a faster car. I need a bike. Just give me the sedan. Bootleg Star Wars. It is

472
01:47:18,489 --> 01:47:21,529
kind of like Star Wars. All right, I only have 11 minutes before this is all done.

473
01:47:30,859 --> 01:47:37,340
I love the... Who's in that vehicle? Oh, it's one of ours. Why would they care? They have to check

474
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:42,180
every single car to see if it's one of their friends. Good link. All right, hold on. Wait,

475
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:53,750
wait, wait, wait. Well, here's the problem. I can't click on the link yet because alt-tabbing

476
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:56,630
freezes the game. So we have to wait till I get to... Wait, I have to steal this or what?

477
01:47:57,430 --> 01:48:07,399
It'll only be hijacked from the rear. So what, am I supposed to drive up behind and jump out of the

478
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:37,239
car or just wedge him? Check the link. I can't right now. I cannot click a link right now. If

479
01:48:37,239 --> 01:48:45,420
I alt-tab, the game will crash. You're going to have to wait until I'm done with this mission.

480
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:13,060
Don't drive into me. This is an armored car. Get out of the way. You're driving on the wrong side.

481
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:18,170
Yeah, I do that in every driving game because it's quicker. You actually get to where you're

482
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:25,699
going way faster. And why is the GPS set incorrectly, by the way? Who put that in?

483
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:30,789
Oh, I just kind of wanted to get you close. Get me close. What do you think I could do?

484
01:49:30,789 --> 01:49:33,270
You don't have confidence I can't get you where you're fucking going?

485
01:49:54,579 --> 01:50:03,100
All right, quick, get him. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

486
01:50:03,899 --> 01:50:19,770
Can I actually... What? Can I fly this? Oh, just a... This is huge. Where are we going?

487
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:44,939
Who's landing zone? Um, that's dumb. That's dumb. I want to... Why can't I fly it?

488
01:50:48,539 --> 01:50:58,010
Okay, come in. I got to spend this money. I have like a million dollars.

489
01:51:08,439 --> 01:51:09,239
How does this guy get in?

490
01:51:18,279 --> 01:51:20,920
Holding a match in his mouth. He's like smoking a match.

491
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,720
Like this dude is... What are you? What are you? Like 15, you go to the gas station, you

492
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:39,880
buy... You just take like the matches and you pretend to smoke the matches. What are you

493
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,619
trying to be cool? I don't get it. Is that the only thing you can get from the store?

494
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:51,640
What happened? Wait, did this...

495
01:51:56,439 --> 01:51:57,640
We just saw this again.

496
01:52:09,479 --> 01:52:11,640
Wake up! Wake up!

497
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:20,920
Okay, here he is. We got him. Good.

498
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:36,340
Is this changing? Skip! Jesus. New shop item. Top supply drop.

499
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:51,220
CQB kit. All right, save game. All right, click on the link now. Let's take a look.

500
01:52:51,779 --> 01:53:08,810
What is it? What do you want me to see? Why is everybody spamming? Wait, what is this?

501
01:53:11,779 --> 01:53:16,819
Wait, is this somebody like... Are you like watching a presentation in like college?

502
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:47,289
What? Wait, hold on. Why are you doing this? Go back to school. Show it. It's a Twitter video.

503
01:53:47,289 --> 01:53:56,819
I can't... Hold on. All right. No, I had... No, no, no, no. This is cute, but like... No,

504
01:53:56,819 --> 01:54:03,510
I don't... That's... I don't want to... No, no, no, no. You go look at it. My game is about to

505
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:11,909
actually freeze. I asked the professor a question. Well, I didn't. You're doing an illegal move in

506
01:54:11,909 --> 01:54:39,770
college. I think it's broken. Are we in? All right, I'm good. I can't stay tabbed out for too long.

507
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:45,479
He's gonna get disqualified from class. You should be doing your homework and not watching

508
01:54:45,479 --> 01:55:03,380
this shitty stream. True. Don't even say that out loud. All right. What about... What about

509
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:10,949
winching? What about a star system? Well, it's a good ques... Wait, get the toolbox above the

510
01:55:10,949 --> 01:55:29,340
specified height and you'll win the wager. Am I gonna be too short for this? I let the trans...

511
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:42,260
Um, okay. What the hell was that? You can fly it? Play and retract the winch. You can fly

512
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:53,979
helicopters. Okay, how do we fly this? How do I deploy it? Up, down? Okay, it's left.

513
01:55:54,619 --> 01:56:16,329
What am I trying to do? Am I picking up the tree? I got it. Okay, now where am I taking this? What

514
01:56:16,329 --> 01:56:20,840
do I... What am I taking this? Out of bounds! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you want me to do?

515
01:56:25,369 --> 01:57:03,979
What? Target five. Do I just let it go? Did I do it? Hold it at five. Okay, hold it at five. Okay,

516
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:53,560
now what? Stack it. Stack it? Stack crates. I dropped it. Okay, it's off, right? Drop it. All

517
01:57:53,560 --> 01:58:31,220
right, go. Why is this one heavier? Okay, what? All right, I got it. I did it. Is that nine meters?

518
01:58:31,220 --> 01:59:05,979
What's the goal? Too much? The target is five. Yeah, but I can't go over the target? Okay, two,

519
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:18,300
five. Okay, nine, seven, six. Is that it? It's six. Oh, come on, really? I did it. What are you guys

520
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:40,100
talking about? I did, I won. 1.4 million. Level two, transit. No, no, information about Eva.

521
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:54,010
Okay.

522
02:00:08,069 --> 02:00:19,140
Can we get rid of this guy? All right, pistol challenge. Introduction to the Plav sniping

523
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:32,439
challenge. All right, one more. I've set up a sniper course. Destroy the portraits of Solano

524
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:43,079
and destroy Solano's cars. You have to stay on the roof. Okay.

525
02:00:54,329 --> 02:01:13,659
How do I zoom in? How do I aim? How do I go into sniper mode? Okay, I got bonus objective updated.

526
02:01:13,659 --> 02:01:31,989
Destroy the bonus statue. What? Wait, am I in like a... I'm like stuck in here. That didn't get

527
02:01:31,989 --> 02:02:04,229
destroyed. I think it's still possible. Ice cream truck. I can't even shoot these ones. This is so

528
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:18,600
fucked up. What the hell? I didn't even save the game before this either. I'm loaded inside of the

529
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:41,770
wall. I get it. Okay. Maybe I could have jumped up here and... That's so stupid.

530
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:48,819
Whatever. It's 100k. I have 1.3 million. All right, I'm just doing introduction to the Plav.

531
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:54,279
I've got some information on the local corruption. The People's Liberation Army of Venezuela,

532
02:02:54,279 --> 02:03:00,439
or PLAV, is a group of leftist radicals. Very radical. They've been hiding out in the

533
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:05,880
jungle for decades. They hate Solano enough to risk direct... What's that laughing face?

534
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:09,960
They're also keen on disrupting Universal Petroleum's business for being

535
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:16,600
willing pawns of the capitalist military... See that? What was that? Whose emote is that?

536
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:22,329
Bella Acosta. She's unusually well-funded, thanks to close ties with the People's Republic of China.

537
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:24,250
She's willing to spend some of their money on world-class mercenaries...

538
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:35,560
It was a laughing face. Yes, that one. What is that? Who is that? All right, I'm ready.

539
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:47,100
Where do I buy things? We could probably go public. Get investors, silk stocks. What do you think?

540
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:50,699
Um, I want to buy something. I have a lot of money.

541
02:03:51,500 --> 02:04:02,039
3D streamer refuses to advertise other streamers' emotes.

542
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:12,739
Okay, what is going on here? Destroy targets? This is Eva's Garage and then

543
02:04:12,739 --> 02:04:20,859
Southeastern Amazon Outpost. All right, we're gonna go to Eva's Garage. This is very far away.

544
02:04:20,859 --> 02:04:29,539
Yeah, where are the clothes? I want to put on something cool. I want to wear a different

545
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:50,979
vest or something. Call a helicopter? Transit. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, yeah, I get it.

546
02:04:52,199 --> 02:05:06,359
You have to get... It's gas. Do I need to get gas? Easy. Nice. Okay, there we go. All right,

547
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:31,289
I want to go to Eva's Garage. Why can't you go there? Wait, it has to be another helipad

548
02:05:31,289 --> 02:06:00,500
that I've already unlocked. Yeah, he gets the picture. Kill him and take it. I don't think I

549
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:32,569
can. Oh, that's where the fuel tanks and money too, right? What do you say? All right, here we go.

550
02:06:32,569 --> 02:06:36,310
Wait, is this bad guys or good guys? Good guys. Nice. All right, these guys are friendly.

551
02:06:38,539 --> 02:06:46,020
Come get this. Resource pickup. Right here.

552
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:53,850
Solano makes us an offer. Oh, sorry, lady. Universal Petroleum can kiss my ass. I don't care

553
02:06:53,850 --> 02:07:06,890
about the oil, just the paycheck. When do we get it? It's very quiet.

554
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:24,739
Good to see one of us made it big. Hold your fire. It's Jennifer Mui. Resource pickup.

555
02:07:24,739 --> 02:08:04,649
Okay, get it. What? What happened? You're my hero. What happened? Why do they hate me?

556
02:08:10,569 --> 02:08:29,420
Oh, okay. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I need to redo it. I stole the oil. Holy shit,

557
02:08:29,420 --> 02:09:05,590
this guy doesn't even care. Wow. I got to track this guy down. Holy shit, he's just going nuts.

558
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:14,939
He's just, he's not stopping. What am I doing? What am I doing? You're right.

559
02:09:30,729 --> 02:09:47,289
This is such a long ride. Wait, does the UP organization hate me now? I didn't even do

560
02:09:47,289 --> 02:10:03,619
that. I just, I don't, whatever. Why would you do that? What's with these planes flying around?

561
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:14,739
There's red planes that keep showing up on the mini-map. Why can't go up that?

562
02:10:15,619 --> 02:10:20,180
How's that? Oh, okay. I was going to say that makes no sense. Trying to shave some time off.

563
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:45,109
Wait, do people know who I am? I guess they kind of do, huh?

564
02:10:46,979 --> 02:11:05,289
I'm kind of going too fast to be identified, aren't I? Oh, I made it. I actually went through it.

565
02:11:05,289 --> 02:11:51,500
Okay, so far so good. I got 25 bucks. What'd I get $25 for? It's a guy in the driver's side.

566
02:11:56,119 --> 02:12:16,310
Okay, let's go. Yeah, this is a shitty gun. I want a new gun. I don't want just like an AK.

567
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:30,090
I want something else. Wait, I can take that, right? Can I? Or am I too far away? Can he

568
02:12:30,090 --> 02:13:05,590
actually get this? Steel tank buster. Yeah. Hello? Wait, somebody's shooting. Get on it.

569
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:17,340
Wait, you mean like stand on that? Oh shit, can I do that? I'll try that next time. I'm just going

570
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:24,729
to crouch on it and see what happens. Let me go to the mission first. Am I going to play Ratatouille

571
02:13:24,729 --> 02:13:35,579
for the Xbox 360? No, I don't think so. I'm sorry. Why? Play Jump King? I'm not going to play Jump

572
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:51,260
King. I promised. When did I promise that I was going to play Ratatouille? Did I? I don't know

573
02:13:51,260 --> 02:14:11,050
why I would ever say that. Money. Is this doing anything? I don't know. Was that a grenade or

574
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:21,640
is that him coming to get this? Okay. This is the best game. Wait, that's the best game ever made.

575
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:30,819
Wait. I forgot. There's another one right here. Don't worry. Ewan stops up. Ewan, come back.

576
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:44,710
He's busy. I know. Come on. Hurry up. Get rid of it so I can do this.

577
02:14:45,449 --> 02:15:06,010
Save the game. Yeah, that's a good call. You promised you'd play it in 2012. What? Do it.

578
02:15:06,729 --> 02:15:35,210
Did I get the money? The guy drove over it. Come on. Give me a break. Remember when you said you

579
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:40,329
were going to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid to us? You had a dream about that. That's not what happened.

580
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:57,659
Here we go. Mission time. Read it? I'm not going to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

581
02:15:58,060 --> 02:16:04,739
You, Ava Navarro? I know who you are. What is?

582
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:07,699
You're the mercenary. The one Solano shot in the ass.

583
02:16:07,699 --> 02:16:09,779
Solano's goon shot me. I figured you'd come here.

584
02:16:09,779 --> 02:16:12,979
What do you mean you figured I'd come here? You're alone. You need help.

585
02:16:12,979 --> 02:16:16,579
You go through vehicles quick. Need them repaired. I'm the best-

586
02:16:16,579 --> 02:16:20,420
So this is the- You hate Carmona.

587
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:22,340
You hate Solano. You probably need a helicopter pilot.

588
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:25,779
I've got a helicopter pilot. What do you have against Carmona?

589
02:16:25,779 --> 02:16:27,939
If you're planning on using airstrikes. I am.

590
02:16:27,939 --> 02:16:30,819
Which I figure you are. All right, so you've got a thing against Carmona.

591
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:37,299
No, just because I'm anti-Carmona doesn't mean I'm pro-mercenary.

592
02:16:37,299 --> 02:16:40,739
All right, you're available. Otherwise, you'd have kicked me out already.

593
02:16:40,739 --> 02:16:42,819
How did you know? What is that going around to?

594
02:16:42,819 --> 02:16:47,459
All right, let's see. There's one last job I must finish before I can close up and help you get-

595
02:16:47,459 --> 02:16:49,940
I'm Solano. Yeah, I'm building a unique vehicle

596
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:54,260
for a special client. I need help getting the parts and then when it's done-

597
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:57,299
It's funny each time. It's funny every time.

598
02:16:57,299 --> 02:17:00,819
And the oil company have a bouncer on me. You don't have a lot of friends, do you?

599
02:17:00,899 --> 02:17:03,860
And I heard something about a jet pilot hiding out with a pirate.

600
02:17:03,860 --> 02:17:06,500
And when this is done, you'll join me? Probably.

601
02:17:07,719 --> 02:17:12,280
Okay, test drive the Acharo de Muerte for Eva.

602
02:17:13,079 --> 02:17:14,600
You remind me of me.

603
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:21,100
Oh, the PC version is fucked. Yeah, that's why I got the PlayStation 3 version and I couldn't

604
02:17:21,899 --> 02:17:23,979
capture it. I don't know why for no reason.

605
02:17:23,979 --> 02:17:25,659
Okay, test drive.

606
02:17:25,659 --> 02:17:27,819
Hop in and take her out for a test run for me.

607
02:17:27,819 --> 02:17:29,500
Why aren't you driving it?

608
02:17:30,459 --> 02:17:32,059
Oh, this is a comedy car. I can't wait.

609
02:17:40,739 --> 02:17:41,540
Is this a tuber car?

610
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:47,049
Are you telling me it's a jump?

611
02:17:48,569 --> 02:17:52,260
Is this a jump?

612
02:17:53,059 --> 02:17:53,620
It better be.

613
02:17:57,190 --> 02:17:59,510
You know what kind of car? Okay, I had one of these.

614
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:03,670
I had a car like this where I could flip it over and it would still drive.

615
02:18:04,629 --> 02:18:08,329
I'd be driving around and they would just flip the fuck over

616
02:18:08,329 --> 02:18:11,290
and I would I could still drive it upside down and right side up.

617
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:12,889
It was awesome.

618
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:18,469
I would drive it this shit over fucking like Clebson.

619
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:20,809
I would drive it all over the place.

620
02:18:20,809 --> 02:18:22,409
I'd gone off on the grass and stuff.

621
02:18:22,409 --> 02:18:23,530
It was awesome.

622
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:24,409
It was so much fun.

623
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:29,290
No, not a regular car.

624
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:31,370
A like an RC car.

625
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:31,870
Yeah.

626
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:39,909
What was that thing called?

627
02:18:39,909 --> 02:18:41,670
It was called like the Reverso or something.

628
02:18:42,229 --> 02:18:44,389
Right at the strip line.

629
02:18:47,559 --> 02:18:48,680
It was fast, too.

630
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:56,340
I can't believe this is an actual jump.

631
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:03,110
Rebound.

632
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:03,670
That's the one.

633
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:04,170
Yep.

634
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:05,510
That thing was awesome.

635
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:16,190
Works.

636
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:20,629
All right.

637
02:19:20,629 --> 02:19:21,190
Rough terrain.

638
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:21,690
Let's see.

639
02:19:31,659 --> 02:19:32,159
Crackdown?

640
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:37,670
Too bad that crackdown three was terrible.

641
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:38,170
All right.

642
02:19:38,629 --> 02:19:50,510
We're good.

643
02:19:51,209 --> 02:19:56,299
Crackdown three was destined to be awful.

644
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:00,010
I don't even remember crackdown two.

645
02:20:00,809 --> 02:20:03,270
I remember crackdown one.

646
02:20:04,069 --> 02:20:08,459
I never played it.

647
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:13,670
Two was the same mission 12 times.

648
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,549
That's unfortunate.

649
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:23,100
Crackdown two was just crackdown one with zombies.

650
02:20:23,659 --> 02:20:25,780
Well, they went with that trope, huh?

651
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:30,620
Oh, I have to hit this.

652
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:32,059
I'm not just going to drive it.

653
02:20:32,059 --> 02:20:33,659
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

654
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:38,860
What is it specifically about this game that is fun?

655
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:43,000
The whole thing.

656
02:20:43,719 --> 02:20:44,920
I think it's really fun.

657
02:20:48,649 --> 02:20:50,170
Oh, I have 25 seconds.

658
02:20:50,729 --> 02:20:59,909
I'm almost there.

659
02:20:59,909 --> 02:21:00,469
I'm almost there.

660
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:03,799
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

661
02:21:03,799 --> 02:21:04,299
No.

662
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:13,180
It's proof of you saying I was going to play Ratatouille.

663
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:22,680
All right.

664
02:21:23,219 --> 02:21:27,350
You know, in my, in my defense, who cares?

665
02:21:36,809 --> 02:21:37,450
I do.

666
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:40,649
Yeah, but like in my defense, it's Ratatouille the game.

667
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:44,899
Oh, who, who does it really matter if I played or not?

668
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:51,180
I mean, I'm going to on September fucking like 28th or something.

669
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:51,500
I don't know.

670
02:21:52,299 --> 02:22:00,819
He's doing the same joke again.

671
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,340
You figured me out.

672
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:15,620
You figured out everything I do with a jump.

673
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:20,579
This is a long mission.

674
02:22:21,299 --> 02:22:24,629
This is I guess your hydraulics work.

675
02:22:24,629 --> 02:22:26,629
Can I go back to driving a motorcycle?

676
02:22:36,299 --> 02:22:37,819
I quit after this mission.

677
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:40,059
That's not going to be me.

678
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:44,659
I want to fly the helicopter.

679
02:22:44,659 --> 02:22:45,860
I want to fly the helicopter.

680
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:52,729
No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

681
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:58,629
Please, no, why?

682
02:22:58,629 --> 02:22:59,670
I don't want to do this again.

683
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:00,709
I don't want to do this again.

684
02:23:09,059 --> 02:23:17,260
Oh, my fucking God quit after this mission.

685
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:18,459
No, it's not going to happen to me.

686
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:20,459
No, it's not.

687
02:23:20,459 --> 02:23:20,620
Okay.

688
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:22,459
I'm just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

689
02:23:34,250 --> 02:23:34,569
Next?

690
02:23:34,569 --> 02:23:35,690
No, but next.

691
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:36,190
What?

692
02:23:36,809 --> 02:23:38,409
No, no, no, no, no, no.

693
02:23:38,409 --> 02:23:39,290
No, no, just hold on.

694
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:52,020
No, I'm staying here.

695
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:56,639
I'm not this game is fucking fun. Just this fish is stupid. Okay, don't worry

696
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:00,159
We're gonna get up the stupid mission and we're gonna go back to fucking full of grenades and people

697
02:24:01,079 --> 02:24:14,739
Cars gonna drive by and I'm gonna get it's gonna hit me and I'm gonna go. Oh, I actually do want to see what else is in

698
02:24:14,739 --> 02:24:20,530
The game. I'm having a lot of fun in this one. All right, I don't don't fuck. I have plenty of time

699
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:30,860
It's still challenge if I can do it. I would love to do it. I want to spend money to everything spent a dollar

700
02:24:31,399 --> 02:24:47,389
It's definitely like a jetpack or something. I don't fuck Matt. The funniest part about the ratatouille game stream

701
02:24:48,069 --> 02:24:54,450
Yeah, well, let's see. I bet you I bet you're like 3,000 or you don't even show up

702
02:24:54,889 --> 02:25:07,750
It's like one of the lowest viewed streams in history

703
02:25:08,469 --> 02:25:13,940
Play ratatouille do it, but he's actually playing ratatouille. Yeah

704
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:18,340
Oh, I got something else going on today. What's going on?

705
02:25:18,959 --> 02:25:38,450
How do I get up there what the fuck wait

706
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:48,090
And then but I have to go back all the way around. I'm not gonna do this. It's gonna fail

707
02:25:48,729 --> 02:25:56,889
Have nine seconds to go around the entire course. Oh my god

708
02:25:57,610 --> 02:26:01,770
Why did I?

709
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:10,649
Know I'm gonna beat it. I don't care. No, no, no, no, no, I'm playing this. No, it's not gonna happen. I have

710
02:26:11,309 --> 02:26:15,069
Okay

711
02:26:15,989 --> 02:26:19,389
There is no next game it is only this game

712
02:26:19,909 --> 02:26:36,000
Yeah, I'm not gonna quit. I am not gonna quit. I want you to remember who said that

713
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:43,180
All you that think I'm gonna quit it's not gonna happen. I'm gonna play this through until it I beat this

714
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:47,260
I'm not the whole game, but enough till I fly the helicopter into like the

715
02:26:48,319 --> 02:26:49,399
car

716
02:26:49,399 --> 02:27:00,649
You know, that's gonna be funny. It's good that way. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to do this again

717
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:02,790
I want to play the game

718
02:27:02,829 --> 02:27:09,079
Don't fuck it up. Just do it. Normally you have plenty of time

719
02:27:09,799 --> 02:27:26,719
Honey, helicopter bit people happy. Yeah

720
02:27:27,639 --> 02:27:37,629
I might be able to get in like a plane

721
02:27:38,229 --> 02:27:42,600
Like a boat too. I was in a boat in the beginning of the game. It's still more to see

722
02:27:43,120 --> 02:28:04,840
Alright, stop this. Here we go playing minecraft after this. We're playing minecraft in like two weeks. Oh

723
02:28:05,639 --> 02:28:17,889
Let them flip you

724
02:28:17,889 --> 02:28:32,600
Yeah, FTK

725
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:37,659
I'll give you some updates on FTK. It is pretty much ready to go. We have to do some testing on it

726
02:28:38,219 --> 02:28:41,700
Here are some of the things that are going to change. I'll tell you right now. You're ready

727
02:28:42,299 --> 02:28:47,860
No aging system. No stamina. The goal of the game is not just to walk around with a stick and try to kill me

728
02:28:49,190 --> 02:28:51,190
No more three months sub

729
02:28:52,270 --> 02:28:55,350
Requirement because I wasn't streaming for two months. So that would be stupid to have that

730
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:59,590
You have to have been subbed when I wasn't streaming. No, you just have to be an active sub

731
02:29:00,129 --> 02:29:03,649
It doesn't matter I don't think it matters if you're community sub or a regular sub doesn't matter

732
02:29:04,649 --> 02:29:18,659
The food there's no food system. It's going to be a full-on adventure

733
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,260
We're gonna do with all of us together

734
02:29:21,579 --> 02:29:27,219
Should be a lot of fun. The rules in the game system is completely changed

735
02:29:27,739 --> 02:29:36,610
What's FTK? It is favor the king

736
02:29:37,329 --> 02:29:52,879
Favor of the king you have to be a two-year sub, but I don't think there'd be very many people that be participating

737
02:29:53,399 --> 02:30:08,239
Alright, this is it. This is the end

738
02:30:12,989 --> 02:30:14,989
Don't flip over it at the very end, please

739
02:30:15,889 --> 02:30:18,200
Why are you taking me through this? Oh

740
02:30:23,149 --> 02:30:25,469
That was my entire- he just blew my face-up

741
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:35,530
Wow long is this

742
02:30:35,530 --> 02:30:41,459
Wait, I thought- I thought you were supposed to run people over

743
02:30:42,139 --> 02:30:49,010
She has not communicated on radio for a while. I don't think she's still talking to me

744
02:30:49,489 --> 02:31:19,760
Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! This is

745
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:22,159
vision to have an end

746
02:31:23,319 --> 02:31:30,930
I don't think this mission has an end come on dude I don't want to do this

747
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:33,049

753
02:32:32,319 --> 02:32:38,840

754
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:42,200
battery will not turn on like the console just won't turn on because the

755
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:50,870

that the mosquito is going to go into your ear and crawl into your brain it

1125
04:01:49,420 --> 04:01:57,059
there's a 3d movie okay if you take if you make that a little bit red and then

1126
04:01:57,059 --> 04:01:59,659
you make another one copy it right next to each other make it a little bit blue

1127
04:01:59,659 --> 04:02:04,819
and then you like in Photoshop or something you move it close together so

1128
04:02:04,819 --> 04:02:18,049

Is that like an elite that that's like a cracked copy of the game

1316
04:47:51,700 --> 04:48:10,119
Don't want to download a cracked exe of the game any updates on the baseball stream. It has been postponed indefinitely

1317
04:48:10,720 --> 04:48:14,360
Until it is safer to do so it was going to be

1318
04:48:15,360 --> 04:48:18,959
like 40 people 50 people in the same spot

1319
04:48:19,919 --> 04:48:21,919
players crew

1320
04:48:21,979 --> 04:48:26,400
Other things it's not possible in this current environment

1321
04:48:29,880 --> 04:48:32,439
A lot of stuff has already been paid for so I have it ready

1322
04:48:33,439 --> 04:48:35,439

Um I did I

1325
04:48:53,549 --> 04:48:59,709
Be honest I haven't put very much time into that yet because it's such a daunting task at the moment that it's in the back

1326
04:48:59,709 --> 04:49:01,709
of my mind every day

1327
04:49:13,459 --> 04:49:15,540

You took a pottery class yet taking a pottery class is not the same as learning an entire language

1338
04:51:38,240 --> 04:51:48,990
How are they?

04:51:48,990 --> 04:51:53,849

05:08:20,270 --> 05:08:35,770
You need a better PC clearly if you can't play a poop game from 20 years ago. This is not a poop game

1416
05:08:36,069 --> 05:08:59,220
This is 2008 TF2 came out a year before this bingo. Let's get in an armored car, please

05:08:59,979 --> 05:09:13,139
Nothing even loaded in this is perfect. What kind of Pentium do I have a?

1424
05:09:50,279 --> 05:09:53,740
That shit will be in your brain

1425
05:09:53,939 --> 05:09:56,240

05:09:56,360 --> 05:10:12,439

05:10:13,060 --> 05:10:35,880
It's just too much particle effects as it just ruins everything shoot the people good I would love to attack this guy

Anti air kit. All right. What is it?

1440
05:14:31,259 --> 05:15:01,650
Can I pick this is so awkward to drive around him. I get it

1441
05:15:01,650 --> 05:15:12,889
I have to tell him to follow me. I follow follow follow follow follow, but is he piloting?

1442
05:15:23,790 --> 05:15:29,099
That's not an up building right

1443
05:15:29,819 --> 05:15:38,680
Okay, thank God it went over it dear lord that was so close

1444

1446
05:16:10,229 --> 05:16:12,229
It's like a bounty here

05:16:12,669 --> 05:16:16,959

1448
05:16:17,279 --> 05:16:49,450
Where's this guy? Oh well destroy the building

Wish I had that missile. That'd be great. Just wait. Okay, see for wait

05:16:55,139 --> 05:17:01,939
Wait, wait, wait see for on the building and then we get in and then I can detonate it, right?

1451
05:17:01,939 --> 05:17:09,099
Does that make sense finish the job first? Oh, right, right, right. You're right. Do the mission. Yeah, that's true

1452
05:17:09,779 --> 05:17:49,520
Dave helipads are for nerds

1453
05:17:50,319 --> 05:18:03,319
Helipads are for incredibly rich people. I mean you can be a nerd and be rich

1454
05:18:03,799 --> 05:18:08,729
But you got to be rich to have a helipad. That's just the way it is 2.4 mil

1455
05:18:09,409 --> 05:18:17,369
I'm taking my help. Look at I can I'm gonna go down there

1456
05:18:17,810 --> 05:18:41,599
Dave, okay. Yeah, so uh the next game we're gonna play

1457
05:18:42,159 --> 05:18:46,430
It's probably Desperados 3. I played Desperados 2 and I loved it

1458
05:18:46,430 --> 05:18:57,549
I made a video on it end of the stream voice. Not quite. No, not yet

1459
05:18:58,049 --> 05:19:13,439
But Desperados should be really fun. If if it's anything like Desperados 2 that was a lot of fun as well

1460
05:19:18,279 --> 05:19:30,419
UPHQ is in the northern part of the city. How high can I go?

1461
05:19:31,939 --> 05:19:33,939
Finish LA Noire

1462
05:19:36,819 --> 05:19:38,819
Three years ago

1463
05:19:39,419 --> 05:19:52,479
But just finish it

1464
05:19:53,720 --> 05:20:01,799
Okay, I want you guys just we'll take bets

1465
05:20:02,400 --> 05:20:07,150
Do you think from the highest point in a helicopter is falling onto the ground is gonna kill me?

1466
05:20:07,630 --> 05:20:13,599
If it does stream is over if it doesn't and I'll do the mission

1467
05:20:21,450 --> 05:20:23,009
We want Naughty Bear

1468
05:20:23,009 --> 05:20:27,509
You don't want Naughty Bear

1469
05:20:28,029 --> 05:20:50,610
What's that? Am I being swarmed right now by other aircraft?

1470
05:21:01,240 --> 05:21:08,349
This is really far away shit

1471
05:21:08,869 --> 05:21:11,619
All the way at the top of the mountain

1472
05:21:11,740 --> 05:21:18,520
People who want Naughty Bear are the same people who want Ratatouille

1473
05:21:18,520 --> 05:21:24,279
They've wanted for the memes for like three minutes and then they leave when he actually plays the game

1474
05:21:25,000 --> 05:21:31,360
Yep

1475
05:21:31,360 --> 05:21:34,360
Sounds about right to me. All right, here we go

1476
05:21:34,959 --> 05:21:43,419
Does this kill me? Yes or no, we'll find out. Here we go. And then they come back

1477
05:21:44,099 --> 05:21:48,299
Four hours later and they go. Holy shit. He's still playing this game

1478
05:21:49,180 --> 05:21:55,130
Yeah, that was the plan. Here we go

1479
05:22:22,009 --> 05:22:33,020
We're good. We got to do the mission now

1480
05:22:40,229 --> 05:22:53,119

One more you got it. All right, it's there

1499
05:27:22,380 --> 05:27:39,150
Is there anything else to do?

1500
05:27:39,150 --> 05:27:45,250
Is there an ownership should we end it? I mean, I had a lot of fun. This was fun

1501
05:27:45,250 --> 05:27:47,250
Like about five or six hours

1502
05:27:48,009 --> 05:28:01,599
Cheat now. Is it actual cheats? Are you guys actually making that up?

That's a friendly. How do you even time that missile to land on me like that? That was fucking crazy

Good grammar and spelling are important. But if you want to write essays that inspire

1550
05:38:14,270 --> 05:38:16,709
messages that forge brighter connections and

1551
05:38:17,750 --> 05:38:19,270
emails that

1552
05:38:19,270 --> 05:38:21,270
Get the job. All right

05:38:21,270 --> 05:38:24,389
Here's the other me to tell you something about like grammarly, right?

1554
05:38:24,590 --> 05:38:29,830
We are just teaching people that they can just mash their keyboards, you know, you have to know how to spell anything

1555
05:38:29,990 --> 05:38:34,709
You don't even have to know when to do periods commas exclamation points never, you know, who cares

1556
05:38:38,599 --> 05:38:42,880
Eventually, we're gonna start you can start writing emotes and Grammarly is gonna write your essay for you

1557
05:38:42,880 --> 05:38:45,080
It's gonna be like German old German rats

1558
05:38:46,080 --> 05:38:58,500
Mugga ash Omega lol and it's gonna write is a fucking story for you. I don't fit the

It's off. It's not here anymore. I cannot control it

1565
05:40:19,020 --> 05:40:21,139

I know some of you guys think this is a joke or something. Oh, what a funny like bit he's doing

05:41:29,290 --> 05:41:34,799
This is gonna knock this is gonna happen it until I hit the X on OBS

1573
05:41:42,409 --> 05:41:49,349
Because the better we all communicate the better we connect yeah, you have to prove it

1574
05:41:50,029 --> 05:41:51,150
Grammarly

1575
05:41:51,150 --> 05:41:52,909
Helping close the window

05:43:26,830 --> 05:43:32,759
No stream tomorrow, by the way, I have doctor's stuff to do. I will not be around tomorrow

1584
05:43:33,439 --> 05:43:35,869
But I will be around Wednesday and Thursday

1585
05:43:36,430 --> 05:43:38,869
Wednesday and Thursday is probably gonna be Desperado's 3

1586
05:43:39,590 --> 05:43:43,110
That's gonna do custom robo as well

1587
05:43:43,549 --> 05:43:51,759
So Wednesday will be Desperado's 3 and then if the game sucks and game sucks will do something else

1588
05:43:53,090 --> 05:44:04,220
Eternal darkness I also have but that'll probably be October. Am I gonna finish mercenaries?

1589
05:44:05,400 --> 05:44:06,840
Probably not

1590
05:44:06,840 --> 05:44:12,650
Although this is this could be one of those now probably not. I think I've seen everything I wanted to see

1591
05:44:13,169 --> 05:44:18,779
What time PST on Wednesday probably around same time today?

1592
05:44:19,959 --> 05:44:26,040
fucking jump

1593
05:44:26,080 --> 05:44:31,919
Probably same time today around like 10 o'clock and 30 started 11 today because of the ps3 problems, but several like 1030

1594
05:44:32,560 --> 05:44:45,810
Am Pacific he's gonna run over by the boat. Wait, he's alive. I

1595
05:44:59,319 --> 05:45:01,319
Can't shoot through this glass

1596
05:45:11,970 --> 05:45:25,229
Well, I can't end the stream I can't stop I'm trying to stop

1597
05:45:25,849 --> 05:46:07,900
All right, I gotta go. I'm gone. I'm officially gone. See you later. This character is invincible

1598
05:46:26,159 --> 05:46:30,759
I can't stop playing. All right, I guess I'm gonna hit the button. Am I sad? No, what?

1599
05:46:31,279 --> 05:46:41,880
My sad

1600
05:46:41,880 --> 05:46:54,860
Why would I be sad? All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. Take your buddy. Let's go

1601
05:46:54,860 --> 05:47:00,549
I got I got a pull it I got a pull the plug pull and plug but done

1602
05:47:00,630 --> 05:47:06,479
Hey, look at that plug has been pulled. That was fun

1603
05:47:06,479 --> 05:47:16,779
I just I couldn't stop but there was mercenaries to but exactly when I wanted out of this game and it is exactly what

1604
05:47:16,779 --> 05:47:22,159
I thought it was going to be I'll see you Wednesday

1605
05:47:22,319 --> 05:47:30,180
Thank you to all the community subs by the way speaking. I want to make sure I make this really clear. There is

1606
05:47:30,860 --> 05:47:35,119
No multi month sub that you need for FTK

1607
05:47:35,459 --> 05:47:41,409
The server is apparently going to be able to handle over the course of I believe it's six or seven different servers

1608
05:47:41,970 --> 05:47:44,840
Connected together somewhere around a thousand people

1609
05:47:45,240 --> 05:47:53,340
Now the people that can actually play in like the main game is somewhere around like two or three hundred maybe four hundred

1610
05:47:53,740 --> 05:48:00,310
Well, we made it differently this time when I say we I mean they

1611
05:48:00,869 --> 05:48:07,069
Where there's gonna be a lot of different like hub worlds connected for a queue system

1612
05:48:07,389 --> 05:48:11,470
So it's not just like the server gets fucking diarrhea don in

1613
05:48:12,029 --> 05:48:15,069
Ten seconds and there's 400 people and then the whole thing crashes

1614
05:48:15,549 --> 05:48:26,009
Top sub gifters to another this top sub gifter hasn't worked since I implemented this in stream labs OBS. It's just there

1615
05:48:26,049 --> 05:48:32,130
It's just those guys. It's a slug every time. It's the rich money guy in the middle and it's like the the metamorphosizing

1616
05:48:33,330 --> 05:48:42,770
Alien squid on the right. It's always these people every time what day you can do custom robo either Thursday or

1617
05:48:43,490 --> 05:48:50,689
Monday depends on how long desperado's is if I have fun in it, but let's run the credits

1618
05:48:51,250 --> 05:48:59,479
Hopefully this works because I'm testing a theory here. The theory is do I have to be on?

1619
05:49:00,119 --> 05:49:07,889
The stream labs page for it to work. Let's test it ready

1620
05:49:11,430 --> 05:49:27,500
Yep, the stream labs page has to be open and on my screen the whole time

1621
05:49:27,860 --> 05:49:31,500
That's new that I didn't need to do that before

1622
05:49:32,060 --> 05:49:41,909
Those are these I stopped streaming for two months and all these windows update makes a bunch of shitty updates gonna be one person

1623
05:49:42,290 --> 05:49:51,500
Stop using stream labs, you know, I wish I could but I've been so used to it for so long that

1624
05:49:52,029 --> 05:50:02,709
I don't want to relearn another system. Hey one guy nice job

1625
05:50:03,369 --> 05:50:07,680
Thanks for the subs everybody. I'm sorry you did I my theory is correct

1626
05:50:12,060 --> 05:50:15,459
Actually one guy his channel is dying sad face

1627
05:50:16,759 --> 05:50:23,669
During's been rough lately. No, we're good. Everything's fine. That could be one person and it would be alright. Don't worry

1628
05:50:24,029 --> 05:50:40,259
Have you seen totally accurate battlegrounds? Uh, I have I wanted to play it a long time ago, but if I was like

1629
05:50:40,259 --> 05:50:52,259
It's early access, right? Why is he so sad? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, stop. Stop it

1630
05:50:52,740 --> 05:50:55,740
You cut this out right now

1631
05:50:55,819 --> 05:51:06,270
But you're all gonna be in big trouble a lot of players recently. Maybe I'd play it. Alright guys, I'll see you Wednesday

1632
05:51:06,709 --> 05:51:08,709
Have a great rest of your night

1633
05:51:10,590 --> 05:51:12,189
Let's do a raid

1634
05:51:12,189 --> 05:51:13,750
If we're not ready in a long time

1635
05:51:13,750 --> 05:51:19,700
I want to try I want to try to cycle people like people that we haven't rated in a very well

1636
05:51:19,700 --> 05:51:21,700
We haven't rated or we haven't read in a very long time

1637
05:51:22,299 --> 05:51:37,610
Who's online at the moment? Let's take a look seeing a bunch of names

1638
05:51:38,330 --> 05:51:46,069
You know, let's let's write Kraken. It's been a long time since we've rated Kraken

1639
05:51:46,470 --> 05:51:51,610
In a while since I've talked to Kraken to it's been a few months

1640
05:51:52,130 --> 05:51:58,020
See how he's doing was he playing outward? Oh Kraken. I said hello

1641
05:51:58,540 --> 05:52:03,939
Enjoy yourselves if you feel like sticking around on a Kraken stream then go for it. If not, and we'll see you Wednesday

1642
05:52:04,380 --> 05:52:07,659
Are you gonna ever use channel points again? Yes

1643
05:52:09,299 --> 05:52:14,369
Eventually, there will be something else to do. I promise. All right. I see you guys later. See you Wednesday

1644
05:52:14,369 --> 05:52:16,369
Have a great rest of your

1645
05:52:16,689 --> 05:52:27,779
Next day or two. See you Wednesday for Desperado's 3 now get out of here scram. I think I spelled his name wrong

1646
05:52:27,779 --> 05:52:31,110
I didn't all right. Take care guys. See you soon
