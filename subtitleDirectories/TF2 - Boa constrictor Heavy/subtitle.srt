1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,419
It's going to be like the hug heavy. Once he gets a hold of you, there ain't no I'm like a

2
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:20,739
fucking boa constrictor. You ever seen the Discovery Channel when the snake bites? He blew himself up

3
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:31,559
on me. Shit. Once I find that like hotspot, I need the melee power-up. That is so important.

4
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,770
That is more important than anything else. That guy still has crits. Okay, here's a hotspot.

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,909
We're at a hotspot. What's that guy got for a power-up? He's got the melee power-up. I gotta

6
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:52,780
kill this guy. What? I don't want the vampire power-up. No, I want the... How do I throw a

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:01:00,250
power-up down? Can I throw a power-up on the ground? Shit. Whatever. I got it. I got it going.

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,790
Let's keep the heavy boa constrictor going. I don't think I'm going to run out of things here.

9
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,000
That would have been so cool if I hit him. I'm attached to him. I got him.

10
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:27,159
All right, cool. This guy. See ya. Give me somebody else. That spy. I'm starting to like not

11
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,280
know what's happening right now. My brain's not like piecing together where I'm going.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:43,909
All right. I was still attached to him. Come here. I missed. He's too fast. Holy shit. I still

13
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:59,700
killed him. Anybody else? Sentry gun. That's not somebody else. I'm actually not totally against

14
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:08,759
having this power-up, but he has it too. That's bad. We're good, but please don't die from the burn.

15
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:20,099
Give me that health. Do I swing faster too? No, I just move faster. This is going to be hard

16
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:29,750
because this guy has that power-up. All right, we're cool. Moving on down. Nope, that's bad.

17
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:48,150
Run him here. Get some health. I want to attach to that guy. Got him. That's not a snake. I just

18
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,719
did like a cat hiss. That's not a snake. Actually a snake. Yeah, the fucking sentry again. The same

19
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,090
fucking one.

20
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:35,819
Bye. That's what I wanted. That's exactly what I wanted. I'll get this heavy. You bastard. You

21
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:46,710
bastard. I even have the speed power-up too and I didn't even get him. I got the spy though.

22
00:03:47,189 --> 00:04:03,620
It's okay. I'm okay with that. Oh shit. Who can I dig into now? Don't backstab me. He's looking for

23
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:17,100
a backstab. He could have got it too. I was attached to him. I was attached to him. Here we go.

24
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:24,149
Get this guy. Ready? Watch this. Watch this. Intercept him. Damn it. That was an Olympic-style

25
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:33,240
punch too and I missed it. I missed the opportunity. That guy's not going to die. This is where we

26
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,139
seriously start to separate the garden snakes from the king cobras. I mean, if you want to be a garden

27
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,339
snake, that's fine. You want to like grab somebody and like bite them in their toe.

28
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:49,100
That's all right. Whatever. For the second you start bringing in the king cobra, or the python,

29
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:58,600
that's me. That's who I am. This guy didn't even know. Got you. You can run, but you can't get away

30
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:09,350
from the fucking python. That's where we get away from the mini-sentry. Get me out of there. Let's

31
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:26,939
fall back to the grass. Get this guy. Gotta, come on, bite him. Bitten. Keep it going. Another one.

32
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:34,540
Let's get, let's get another one. This guy right here. I had him. I had him. I lost him. I lost

33
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,750
him because I like turned around. I just did like the hokey pokey. Turn myself around. That's what

34
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,459
it's all about. You just, come on, man. I need that health. This is dangerous. That was really

35
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,870
dangerous. I should not have done that. Somebody coming right now. Somebody coming right now.

36
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:02,490
No, I'm going to die there. I'm going to die here. Get out of there. Oh shit. Oh God.

37
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:12,819
Oh God. Get away from me. Get away. Up through the laundry chute. That guy's not even paying

38
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:20,709
attention. I'll take it. I'll take the guy not even paying attention kill. Do we have a medic?

39
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:32,680
I gotta latch that guy. Yeah, there's the medic. There's the medic. Medic, please help me. I'm in

40
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:47,860
the middle of a great snake run. If that guy, seriously. Sorry, that was a pretty good run.

41
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:58,060
I'll take that one. We're actually going to win? How long have I been doing this for? I feel like

42
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:14,040
I've been doing this for a long time. Okay, we did it. Nice work. 118. Yeah, this has been going on

43
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:27,670
for a long time. Had a little bit of an issue there, but I still, what the hell's going on?

44
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:36,459
Give me the health. You're so fast, but it don't matter, does it? You're never going to outsmart

45
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,360
the snake. I'm going to burn here. I need to keep going. Hopefully I don't burn.

46
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:56,439
Woo. Who's next? Oh, you next? Yeah. Keep it going. Keep it going. Gotta find someone to latch. Latch

47
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,449
on to somebody. Latch on to somebody. Pick up the health. I got the super power up. Oh, man.

48
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:16,139
Oh, God. Got ya. What, you want some too? Who's next? Who's in the long list of potential snake

49
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,259
bite victims?
