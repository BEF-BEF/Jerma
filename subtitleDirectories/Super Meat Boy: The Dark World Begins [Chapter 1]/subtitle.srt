1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,390
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy!

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:23,320
This is going to be Rage in a Basket that I open up and birds fly out of the basket and peck my eyes out.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,320
I am going to be doing the Dark World.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,320
And of course, I'm going to start with Chapter 1. We're going to go back to the beginning, back to the roots of the game.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,859
I don't know, let's get this started, I don't know how long this is going to last.

6
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:44,659
I probably, to be realistic with you guys, I'm probably going to rage quit the Dark World.

7
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,659
Like, two to three chapters into this.

8
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:50,659
Because some of these levels are just ridiculous.

9
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,659
But I am going to do the Dark World, going to try and do it.

10
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:57,969
So what do you say to all of you? Welcome to the Dark World.

11
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,969
That hurt my voice, but you know what? It's okay.

12
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,400
Here we go! Dark World Chapter 1, as Meat Boy.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, this already sucks.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,769
So if you don't know what the Dark World is...

15
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,140
Actually, I should go from this way.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,310
The Dark World...

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,310
That was easy.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,310
The Dark World is just much, much harder versions of the levels you've already played.

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's get...oh my god, this is so bad.

20
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,290
Good!

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,420
This one, if I remember...oh, there's a Band-Aid here.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Should I even dare try to get the Band-Aid?

23
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,989
Oh, I don't know if that's happening.

24
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,989
No, not happening. I'll try for it later.

25
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:45,989
I may in fact do a series where I get a lot of the Band-Aids.

26
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,989
Kind of like a Band-Aid-tage, I guess you could say.

27
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,989
That might be coming in the future, but for now, I just want to try and get through some of the Dark World.

28
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,989
Some of it!

29
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,230
So let's go, go, go, go, go!

30
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,230
That's the name of the game you go!

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,790
Oh, that's not the way you're supposed to go.

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:13,370
The Dark World. Everything is dark and dim and dying.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,500
That wasn't actually that bad.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,830
I am the Knight, says Batman.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,349
Batman Begins, Batman Beyond.

36
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,659
I still have not seen The Dark Knight Rises.

37
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,340
I don't know why. Why have I not seen that movie?

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
Can somebody answer me that question?

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,580
Jerma, yeah. Why have you not seen The Dark Knight Rises?

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,949
I don't know, I haven't seen it yet.

41
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,129
I guess that's a good enough answer.

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,439
Ooh, A+.

43
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,439
So what happens if you, I know to open up the Dark World levels, you have to get A-pluses on the Light World levels.

44
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,439
But what happens when you get A-pluses on the Dark World levels? Does that do anything spectacular?

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,259
I think it just adds to the overall completion of the game.

46
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,259
And this, yeah, oh, I didn't even see that saw blade!

47
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,750
Ugh!

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,229
Keep that in mind when you get up here again.

49
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,229
That's not what you want to be doing!

50
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,879
Uh-oh!

51
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,879
Starting to get a little bit mad here.

52
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,879
You, alright, just slow down.

53
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,699
Slow down, you freak.

54
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,150
Ooh, oh!

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,319
I got this. I got this.

56
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,319
Slow down! Jump!

57
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh my god!

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,620
I swear!

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
And I swear!

60
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,919
By the moon and the stars and the sky!

61
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,919
What song is that?

62
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,680
Whoever can guess that song gets a cookie!

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Even though I don't have any cookies to give, I can just pretend to give you one.

64
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,050
Oh no, I'm really ruining this for myself right here.

65
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,050
I gotta...

66
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,669
Oh no!

67
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,060
Oh, it's over!

68
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Just get out of my way.

69
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,560
Get...

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Stop falling over back and forth.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,210
Getting up there is no problem.

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,210
It's when you're actually here.

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,830
This is...

74
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,830
You want to get up top like this and...

75
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,829
Oh god!

76
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,939
That's a cat.

77
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,620
Hissing.

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,180
You know you're starting to lose your mind with this game when you actually start to hiss or make animal noises.

79
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,620
So if I...

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,620
Oh, look what I just did!

81
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Yay!

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Look at that!

83
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,620
I can jump over there now!

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Urgh!

85
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,740
Let's go...

86
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Watch it!

87
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
That was close.

88
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,420
That was very close.

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Indeed.

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
I gotta not do that.

91
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Get the top layer and then...

92
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,839
Shhh...

93
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,839
Just like that.

94
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,839
Just like that.

95
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,839
No!

96
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,230
Just jump over it.

97
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,230
Who cares about the stupid thing in the middle?

98
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,199
Fuck face.

99
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,069
I am going to elbow drop this game.

100
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,569
I'm going to go to wherever this game is stored on my Steam Cloud.

101
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:19,569
And I'm going to Randy Savage elbow drop it.

102
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,350
Off the top friggin' turnbuckle.

103
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,350
This is so hard.

104
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,350
I just gotta...

105
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,350
You know what?

106
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,350
Just jump over.

107
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,350
Jump.

108
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,350
Jump over.

109
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,350
Jump.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,850
Jump.

111
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,850
No!

112
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,850
I had it!

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,410
I just had it!

114
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,410
Alright.

115
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,500
Seriously.

116
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Seriously, no.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Let's go.

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Come on.

119
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
This is getting a little ridiculous.

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Jump.

121
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I can't believe that...

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I sound like Stewie Griffin.

123
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,060
You know, I say...

124
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,060
I can't believe that Super Meat Boy is this difficult of a game.

125
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
You know, I don't like it at all.

126
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,370
I would much rather kill Mother.

127
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,370
Oh my god.

128
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,370
Just beat the level.

129
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,089
When am I going to rage quit the Dark World?

130
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,089
Probably right now.

131
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,420
I can't do this.

132
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
All it takes...

133
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
See, the hardest...

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
You know what?

135
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Screw this!

136
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,470
Should have done this so friggin' long ago.

137
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,100
This is so simple with Commander Video.

138
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
What the hell am I doing?

139
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,430
Oh, look.

140
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,430
Commander Video.

141
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,430
Oh, you like beat it with Commander Video because it's easy with Commander Video?

142
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,740
God.

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,490
What a stick in my eye and turn it around five different ways.

144
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,870
Commander Video.

145
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,870
Come on.

146
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,870
You're the best character in the game.

147
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,300
Let's go.

148
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Oh, look at that.

149
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Beautiful.

150
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
That wasn't beautiful.

151
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,819
That was not beautiful.

152
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:03,819
Started out okay.

153
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,819
And then got real ugly really quick.

154
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,220
Wow.

155
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,800
No.

156
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I held it down.

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Wow.

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
How the hell did I survive that?

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,279
I'm coming, Princess.

160
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,759
I don't even know.

161
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,759
What was the name of this level?

162
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,759
Fire something?

163
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,379
Fire something or other?

164
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,649
Oh, I just fall down and ditch and die.

165
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,850
Can I jump up the top there?

166
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,339
I think I can.

167
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,610
Can I make that?

168
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,910
No, definitely not.

169
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,220
Maybe if I had the patience to try this.

170
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,839
No, no, no.

171
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
We're not going to do that.

172
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,490
We're going to do this the way it's supposed to be done.

173
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,660
Just like this.

174
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,160
Just like that.

175
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,339
And stumble a bunch.

176
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,339
And now you're screwed.

177
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,959
Yay.

178
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,269
Doc.

179
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,269
World.

180
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:09,250
Take the whole damn wall down.

181
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,939
I can't be going that high.

182
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,939
Okay.

183
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:13,939
Jump up here.

184
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:14,939
Jump around.

185
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,879
There it is.

186
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,019
Finally.

187
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,019
And I got an A plus to boot.

188
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,379
Oh, I should have.

189
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,379
I should be showing some of these lives.

190
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,990
Oh, man.

191
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,990
Oh, man.

192
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,990
Oh, man.

193
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,990
That was tough.

194
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,990
What?

195
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,580
Was there a Band-Aid up there in the top left?

196
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,259
Band-Aid right there.

197
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,740
This is going to be tough.

198
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Come on.

199
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,009
Come down.

200
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,570
Why?

201
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,570
Why?

202
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,580
Up, up, and away.

203
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
Again.

204
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,590
Again.

205
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,590
Wow.

206
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:03,929
Just don't be stupid here and you got it.

207
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,000
You, you're stupid.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,200
You did it anyways.

209
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,950
Kick machine.

210
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,980
I'll give you a kick.

211
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,289
I'll kick you right in the balls.

212
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:25,779
Floating is so good.

213
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,139
It's so useful.

214
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,139
Man.

215
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,139
Oh, man.

216
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,139
This is going to hold.

217
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,139
I got to look at this.

218
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,139
I got to look at the pattern here.

219
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,470
So you got to go up in the very beginning.

220
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,970
So I got to go up right here.

221
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,460
No, right here and wait, jump, wait, jump.

222
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
And that's it.

223
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
And I have to go through.

224
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Oh, no.

225
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,600
Oh, no, dude.

226
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Really?

227
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm going to jump over it at perfect times.

228
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,250
Get it.

229
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,470
Night game.

230
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,929
Sure.

231
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,549
I'll play some night golf.

232
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,559
You guys have ever played night golf with the illuminated balls?

233
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,559
It's actually pretty fun.

234
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,169
Go, go, go, go.

235
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,340
All right.

236
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Now I got to go now.

237
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Damn it.

238
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
I went at the wrong time.

239
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:26,059
Oh, for the love of just.

240
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,059
Wait, go.

241
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,230
Wait, go.

242
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm done.

243
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
This is over.

244
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,759
I got this.

245
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,320
Get up there.

246
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,779
Hello, my sweet queen.

247
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,779
Getting close.

248
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,720
I only have a few more levels of the first dark world.

249
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,960
I might change back to meat boy for this one.

250
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Maybe not.

251
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,259
The floating really helps like that.

252
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,259
But it didn't matter anyways, because I'm stupid.

253
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,129
Damn.

254
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh, I don't know what to do with myself.

255
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,429
There we are.

256
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,429
Oh, God.

257
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,429
OK.

258
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:12,529
After this one goes around, go now.

259
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,730
Hey.

260
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,309
What do you know?

261
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,309
Level 18.

262
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,309
The level that hurts your eyes.

263
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:24,299
Just know.

264
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,299
Wow.

265
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,120
That gets close.

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I got to go before it comes up.

267
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
No.

268
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,129
That thing is really close.

269
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,129
You got to get it done.

270
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,620
Meat boy.

271
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
You have to go really, really fast here.

272
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,179
Right when this moves over, you got to go right now.

273
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,179
Quick.

274
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,179
Quick.

275
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,659
There it is.

276
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,659
The Queener.

277
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:47,659
Here is the end.

278
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:48,659
This is it.

279
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:49,659
Give me that bandaid.

280
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,350
Can I get it?

281
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
Oh, I can get that.

282
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,350
That's a bandaid I can get.

283
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,230
No problem.

284
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,110
Give me that bandaid.

285
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,110
Oh, no.

286
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,110
I want that bandaid.

287
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,610
I can get this.

288
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Come on.

289
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,169
Stop being such a fool, man.

290
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,299
There it is.

291
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,779
OK, cool.

292
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:09,779
Don't.

293
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:17,269
And bandaid get.

294
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,409
Hooray.

295
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,779
And this is it.

296
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,299
Hopefully this doesn't take me 5,000 years.

297
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,100
Whoa.

298
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
OK.

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,750
Got to be even more cautious here.

301
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,379
No.

302
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,379
Oh.

303
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,379
Oh, my God.

304
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,379
I'm running on pure just anger and hatred right now.

305
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,379
Wow.

306
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:46,549
That was close.

307
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,549
Come on.

308
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes.

309
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I did it.

310
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,309
This is going to be the Dark World completed for Chapter 1.

311
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,309
Excellent.

312
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,309
Phew.

313
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,639
Oh, my God.

314
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,019
That was pretty nuts.

315
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,019
So yeah, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.

316
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,019
Thank you so much for watching.

317
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,019
I really do appreciate it.

318
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,019
And we're going to take on Chapter 2, Dark World, in the next episode.

319
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:15,019
And you might see before that, I don't know how I'm going to do these next few videos,

320
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:20,019
but you might see a bandaid run where it's a montage or a few clips of me getting all

321
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:24,019
the band-aids in a particular world or something or other.

322
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,019
So, thanks, guys, for watching.

323
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,019
I really do appreciate it.

324
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,019
And I'll see you guys all next time.

325
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,019
And, of course, take care, everybody.
