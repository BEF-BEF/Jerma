1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,750
Ready? Get ready. He's gonna say it. He's gonna say it right now. Ready what?

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:31,309
War. War, yeah. War never changes today. War never changes. No, I don't.

3
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,549
Okay, skip.

4
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:39,049
Can you get that? It's probably that salesman. He comes for you every day.

5
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:46,460
Just got hit in the face by a broomstick, honey. Can you get the goddamn door?

6
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,409
Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to Federal Offense with German985.

7
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,579
What's that? We're gonna take this guy's mail? Federal off-

8
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,490
He doesn't have any mail. Hold on. We're gonna find a guy with a mail in his mailbox.

9
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,490
Oh, fuck it. We're really gonna town now. Who cares?

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,290
Huh? Oh shit. A raider.

11
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:20,879
Get him. Get him. Get him, boy.

12
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,849
Don't kick my dog, you fucking bitch.

13
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,920
See if he had anything worth taking.

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,459
We're looking for cash. We're looking for ammunition, supplies. Or you could take off all the guys clothes.

15
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:46,469
Easy with that thing, dude. Easy with that thing, dude.

16
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,730
Take a look at that, boy. Diamond City. It's a beautiful area. Wonderful people.

17
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,730
Let's get to know some of them.

18
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,730
Looking for someone who's gone missing.

19
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,349
Gone missing? Who is he?

20
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,069
A baby boy. Kidnapped.

21
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,069
A baby boy? Really? I'm afraid.

22
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:24,229
I'm lost, pastor. I need help. Please.

23
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:30,840
Well, I don't want Nick Valentine.

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Thanks. I'll go talk to him.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Take care of yourself now.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Piper, you're back.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,900
Who's there? Gonna be a good fight.

28
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,229
Will you shut up?

29
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:50,229
Seriously, I'm trying to like sneak up on people and this guy's just screaming at them. Will you duck?

30
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,229
Wait, the hell?

31
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,659
You fucking idiot.

32
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:02,469
This is what happens when you scream.

33
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:09,289
When you scream about puny humans. When we're trying to be sneak attacking. What do you want me to do, dude?

34
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,870
Get cover.

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,870
Officer?

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,870
Nice hat.

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,180
You like my hat? Thanks.

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,180
Park the car in the yard? How about I hammer you in the heart with a haymaker?

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
Oh, Boston.

40
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
No funny business.

41
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,860
You're from Boston.

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Get me out of here.

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:35,870
Our new arrival. I wish I was in your shoes. Getting to see our glorious city for the first time. How can I help you?

44
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,139
A man named Kellogg used to

45
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,780
Oh, what is that? I-95? Oh, that's a good fucking highway.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,780
The history of Boston Common.

47
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm interested in the history of this place.

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:05,669
Let us go back hundreds of years. It is the year 1775 or seven years.

49
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:20,540
Excuse me.

50
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Gotta pick me up if you're feeling glum.

51
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
You got drugs?

52
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
Oh!

53
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Did you say something about drugs?

54
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
That's right. All the chems you need to fill out your lifestyle.

55
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Right.

56
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Everyone here buys from-

57
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Fuck you! How dare you sell drugs?

58
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,660
Uh, not now.

59
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Cool. Cool.

60
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
You should think about getting a trim.

61
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,420
Yeah. Hey, can I have a sip of your Coca-Cola? Thanks.

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,100
Uh-huh.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,720
Can I, uh, can I have a sip of your other Coca-Cola? Thanks.

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,420
You're using that umbrella. It might rain tomorrow. Thanks.

65
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Don't be shy now.

66
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,230
Can I have the container that holds the umbrella, too? I don't think I have one.

67
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,100
Oh, thanks. Can I have the desk fan, too? Thanks.

68
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,500
Can I have all this stuff in your medicine cabinet? Thanks.

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,439
What about your safe? There's a lot of stuff in here, too.

70
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,439
Can I have-

71
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,439
This could be yours.

72
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,439
I'll put it back!

73
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,439
I'll put it back!

74
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,449
Just wait!

75
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,449
I'm gonna put it back!
