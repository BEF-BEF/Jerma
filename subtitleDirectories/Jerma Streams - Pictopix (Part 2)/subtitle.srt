1
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:22,199
Let's open up... I'm gonna change my tweet as well, because it is not correct. Let's get rid of that.

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:46,969
Let's put a new one up that just says, uh, Pic... Picross. Picross. All right. No. Picross. Picross.

3
00:00:46,969 --> 00:01:03,420
I don't know what's right. How about just Picross now? That's fine. I'm okay with that. Hey, look

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:12,390
at that. All right, so those of you that are gonna stick around, we're just gonna play Picross.

5
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,189
We're gonna do Picross. Hey, Picross, ask me anything. How does that sound? Uh, ask me anything

6
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:39,019
Picross stream. Well, ask me almost anything. Oh god, that was a... kind of just opened that one up.

7
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:50,120
PictoPix. There it is. My favorite little thing to play. Let's get it on screen. Have you ever

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,340
played 3D Picross? I have. Ever gonna play Bayonetta 2? Uh, probably not. Are you gonna...

9
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,250
Am I gonna do Scrabble? I'm probably not gonna play Scrabble. What are all of your political

10
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:22,300
opinions? All right. Uh, hold on. Do I still have the Twitch integration? I think so. I think

11
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:35,210
it worked. Another 50 dollars from NotEKinz. I said it wrong. Thank you for the 50 bucks

12
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:47,960
correcting my mispronunciation. My goodness. This is like 400 dollars. I made like

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:59,539
four or five hundred fucking dollars by having a bootleg Dreamcast broken disc

14
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:15,030
and a top-down hard game that I gave up after like 45 minutes. Thank you guys. That's

15
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:24,250
fucking insane. Uh, I think the Twitch integration still works. Let's find out if it does.

16
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:38,060
PictoPix. There it is. So where did we leave off last time? So we made the mushroom, the boots,

17
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:47,030
and he's... I'm bragging. No, no. I'm fucking surprised is what I'm saying.

18
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:57,419
All right. Is Twitch integration working? It is. All right. So there is Twitch integration in

19
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,490
this game. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to play. I don't want you to play. I need

20
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:18,759
to relax. Wait, why is it? All right. So, okay. Let's fucking reboot the stream and play this

21
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:29,860
chill puzzle game. Everybody, here's how you play. So as you can see, 10 by 10. It's a

22
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:39,699
baby mode 10. We're just doing this to get everybody prepared. But no, let me be fair here,

23
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:46,259
though. There are probably a lot of people that are here that were not here last time

24
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:56,550
a week ago. So I... How do you... This is how you play. I'm going to do it. Time me.

25
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll put a 30 second timer on screen. No, 10 second timer on screen. Ready? 10. So every

26
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,240
one of these numbers is a corresponding square. So for three, for instance, there's three squares

27
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,319
in a row down this column here, right? So I don't know where it is. I have to use deduction.

28
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,230
See? Nine. That means there are nine here. Every time there's a space, there has to be

29
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:33,019
at least one cube in between this number. Got it. Time's up. That's how you play.

30
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:39,740
So we got... That's it right there. Actually, no, that can't be certain. One, two, three,

31
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,339
four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah, that can't be certain. You weren't listening? Just enjoy

32
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:52,889
the pictures and enjoy the hangout session. See? I know this is two here. Where's my X?

33
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,259
There it is. So remember, I know for a fact there's no way because this one has to be a

34
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:05,240
space. We're just going to relax. Are you going to shit talk Joel again? No, this is

35
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,490
my relax session. I'm not shit talking anybody right now. So for instance, we've got three,

36
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:24,139
six, seven, eight, nine. Not enough. And you can... I'm not using it right now, but there is

37
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:31,500
Twitch integration. So you're probably going, well, how did you... Because this is nine out

38
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,569
of 10. These have to be filled in for this to make any sense. Same thing with seven,

39
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:42,569
right? Seven, as you see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four,

40
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,300
five, six, seven has to be there. Which, hey, look at that. We now know that the three is

41
00:06:48,300 --> 00:07:00,389
either here or here. Right? You understand? And this guy... Oh, right. The spam. I probably

42
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,810
should just turn it off. Should I just turn off the integration until I let you guys play around?

43
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:16,839
I don't mean to spam. It's not me spamming. All right. So we've got one, two, three, four,

44
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:23,259
five. One, two, three, four, five. Can't do that. Let's see. Five, two. This is one.

45
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,399
There's a one here. Eight. So I told you like I told you before. I know that it has to be

46
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:42,459
there. Okay. And we got two. There's only one more here. Am I going to play stunt man? Yeah,

47
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:50,139
I will. You can complete it. Yeah. You guys, every like two or three, I usually let chat do one.

48
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,199
So interestingly enough, see how we have this block here. This has to be seven in a row.

49
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,160
Therefore, see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. These have to be filled in. One,

50
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,069
two, three, four, five, six, seven. Paying attention. I'm happy that you are. Take a

51
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,750
look what happened here. This is five. So one, two, three, four, five. Already done.

52
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,860
This is also already done. So we can feel the whole rolling. This is also not done completely.

53
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,389
See how there's nothing else here. It's grayed out, which leaves. Hey, look at that. Two.

54
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:32,070
And what happened here? Three, space, two. It's that simple. Whenever we do it together,

55
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,129
we just try to screw you. We're space Michael. Wait, there actually is music.

56
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,389
It was turned off because it just, it's the same song. It's the same like jazz piano.

57
00:08:52,679 --> 00:09:00,220
Boring. Whatever. All right. So let's see. What do we get to work with here?

58
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:09,460
This is done completely. There's still a couple here. Seven, five. So one, two, three, four,

59
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,139
five. One, two, three, four, five. I think we can do more than a few of these.

60
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,139
Two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Yep. All right. So three, three.

61
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:26,700
Mark them. So there's a one here somewhere. This song makes me want to shit. No,

62
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,460
we're not doing the brown nose joke again. Where's the one here though?

63
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:44,200
Play Chowder Man instead. No Chowder Man. It probably is just one, two, three, four, five.

64
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,539
No, it's definitely not here because if this is the, if this is the two,

65
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,700
right, then there's nothing there. So you have to assume one, two, three, four, five.

66
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:04,259
And there's three, which leaves that. That's done. Put on Chowder Man.

67
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,580
You guys really want me to put on Chowder Man. Do you really want that?

68
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:18,019
I have a, why is there a command that says I have a YouTube channel where I upload my

69
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:28,200
videos in 4k? That's a lie. That's not real. All right. I'll play Chowder Man for like 30 seconds.

70
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:57,210
Okay. So take a look here. Three, one, two, there's a block. One. No, it has to be

71
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,850
somewhere in here. Therefore one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. That has to

72
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:16,659
be it. This row is done. This row is done. This song is killing me. Make it louder.

73
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:30,059
You don't actually want this to be louder. Hey, look, it has to be there. It has to be here.

74
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,490
And then you got two. Let's see. We cleared out this, this.

75
00:11:39,639 --> 00:12:00,090
All right. You want to stop talking? Fine. It's probably here. It's just Dig Dug. No,

76
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:14,309
it's not Dig Dug. This is probably just right here. So, oh, you can, by the way,

77
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:26,789
hashtag guess. You can guess what it is. I wonder if it's down here. It might be like

78
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:38,789
here. What the hell am I doing? Chowder Man, sir. I don't know what the fuck I just did

79
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:45,980
that for. I just fucked the whole thing up. I just tried to complete it by guessing. I don't

80
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:57,799
remember which way it was. This is not really there. There's definitely some type of C

81
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:14,389
person. Fixed A7. No, that's not right though. All right. This is literally causing

82
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:21,029
my brain to cease functioning. It's actually making my brain cease to function playing that

83
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:37,610
song. Is it Garfield? It's not Garfield. Then that is here. It's probably here.

84
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:53,610
Let me just fill that in. Uh-huh. Yep. The question is, yeah. It really, it just beef

85
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:09,110
brain me. What is it? Is it Sonic? Sonic the Diver? All right. What's next? This is

86
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:34,179
called Hot Dad? Oh, that's the artist. Oh, okay. We'll just keep it on. All right. Here

87
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:44,870
we go. So you're just doing how it works. Good. Let's see. That one's going to be

88
00:14:50,600 --> 00:15:01,450
one, one, one, down, five, one, two, three, four, five. Bingo. These I can't tell. That's all the

89
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,370
ones there. Hey, look at that. You got to be here. You got to be here. You got to be here.

90
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,730
No, you don't. That's not even true. Why am I even pretending that that's the real answer?

91
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:27,019
It could be either side. One, one, one, one, somewhere in here. That works. And then

92
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:36,340
let's see. This is four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

93
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:45,980
Yep. Here's your two. It was there actually. It's definitely here too. It kind of has to be.

94
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:56,730
But I don't know that yet. Yes, I do. They get to four. So we got one, two, three, four.

95
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:10,980
One, two, three, four. Look at that. Three, one, two. Here's the one here. So that's

96
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:25,059
four down. This is done. So that's here. Okay. Here's your four. Tools. Looks like a question

97
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:52,870
mark so far. Seven. I have to have my tools. One, it has to be here. There's two, two. There

98
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:07,859
it is. What is it? Hey, it's a paint roller. Who got it? Nice work guys. You want to play

99
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,569
Splatoon music? Oh no. Splatoon as in that's what that looks like. Yeah, I got you. But

100
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:25,059
let me play. I'll only do one more and you guys can do it. Pizza song.

101
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:42,680
This guy, C-Man doesn't have an OST. I don't think so. Play the theme from Margo's Wet

102
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:53,660
Nurse. Wait, isn't that the song that goes like, yeah, this song's fucked up.

103
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:07,769
All right. I'll do one more and you guys can do one. Three, four, five, six, seven,

104
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:20,920
eight. No. Wait, hold on. Three. Actually, hold on here. That's three. These ones has to be here.

105
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:33,140
Yeah. What a creepy fucking stream this is. Hey guys, I'm just playing Picross and listening

106
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:47,339
to weird like fucking lullaby music. Are you guys enjoying the stream? Yeah, this went off

107
00:18:47,339 --> 00:19:08,180
the rails, huh? Let's see. Two. It could be, no, it has to be here. One, two, three.

108
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:17,829
No. How many teeth do I have? Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

109
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:22,630
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. I have fourteen teeth.

110
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:48,279
That's pretty good. What the hell is this? It's a cartoon. What kind of fucked up cartoon is

111
00:19:48,279 --> 00:20:10,900
this? One, two, one. What is this? Cartoon? Speech bubble. How would you get that?

112
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:34,819
Anybody get that? All right. Well, I'm gonna do one more and you guys do one. My last one. He's

113
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:41,509
addicted. It is very addicting that this game is so addicting. I would put it in my top,

114
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:47,579
probably my top 250. Seven to eight out of ten games I think I've played over my life

115
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:54,900
that I sometimes like to play sometimes. Wait, that's not true. This might be part of the,

116
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:01,140
no, it has to be. One more. It's just like crazy taxi. You get to,

117
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:09,240
we get to guess the picture together. See, this is probably a field goal. Let's see. One,

118
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:21,660
one. That's two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So here we go. This one's for

119
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:36,329
free. I love getting them for free. How long is this song? Might as well play the winter

120
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:41,829
lantern singing. Oh, I remember how terrifying that was. The one that goes.

121
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,039
Is that what's coming up? Now this is a real good one. This is the, this is Garman.

122
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,910
All right. Spoiler alert. If you haven't played Bloodborne, it's one of the best

123
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,430
games ever made. Go play it and then come back and watch the stream. Try to beat it

124
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:08,740
in like less than two or three hours. So that's one, one. It's probably four. Yeah,

125
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:43,640
this is a drink. It's Glitch, the twitchy mode. Deal. It is the three. Unbelievable.

126
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:52,460
Okay. Look, can I just say if Sekiro is even 10% of how fun and amazing I think

127
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:03,660
Bloodborne was, it's going to be game of the century for me. So it has to be here.

128
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:14,140
I can see it coming together.

129
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:35,740
Possibly one. That's gotta be there. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

130
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:46,890
Here it comes. Yeah. The best part. The best part of the whole song.

131
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,130
At the end of the games that I'm excited for. I mean, Sekiro is just, is number one.

132
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,500
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for a From Software game that's not Dark Souls

133
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,680
since Bloodborne released. And that's not to say anything that's anything wrong with Dark Souls.

134
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:18,730
I just like when they do something a little different. All right. What is it? We've got it.

135
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:29,029
It's like a beer. Beer glass. Oh, some of you guys got fucking destroyed. One, two, three, four,

136
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:33,349
five, six. So only seven or eight of you got it right. All right. I'm gonna do one more.

137
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:46,420
You guys can take it. Last one. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

138
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:56,680
It's our turn. I'll give you one more. You guys can get a go. Two, three, four, five, six, seven,

139
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:06,069
eight. Not quite. One, three, one, one, five. I mean, it kind of has to be here.

140
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:16,119
That doesn't help me very much though. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Also

141
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:27,049
part of a four and one. He's never gonna let us have our turn. Four, five, six, seven, eight,

142
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:39,049
nine. No, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That has to be the three. And look at that.

143
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:47,539
When you really solve it, it itches a part of your brain. So this is one, two, three, four,

144
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:56,869
one, two. It can't be any of these. Let's go ahead and do this. It could be two and then

145
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:02,630
six. I'm not sure. This is the most intense PictoCross stream with this music. Yeah.

146
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:23,180
I like it. It's think music. Two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, that two and the six

147
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:31,849
is three, right? Look at the one, three, one. One, two, three. This has to be part of the three,

148
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:38,759
right? Because if it was one, two, three. No, this is the three here. Got the ones.

149
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,359
This is also a one. There's your two. I think the same thing's gonna happen here. It is

150
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:54,579
three. Get that space down. And then there's your two. There's your six. Now let's see.

151
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,900
This is three. This is part of the four. It has to be. There's your two. There's your one.

152
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:17,369
What is this an image of? How do you go from that to Gwyn? Come on, Gwyn. Watch it. Watch it.

153
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:35,029
One, two, three. One, two, three, four. Come on, Gwyn. Come on. Got it. Okay. I'm gonna laugh

154
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:42,460
if this is like gingerbread house. We got it. A lot of you got it this time. All right.

155
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,819
All right. All right. All right. It's time for you guys to play. This is fruits. I'll make it. I'll

156
00:27:47,819 --> 00:28:05,880
give it to you right here. Have fun. Get it done. Every five, every like eight seconds,

157
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:17,140
it fills up whatever the most typed into chat. Write for it again. Did I get teleported

158
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:27,990
like a week and a half ago? Did I think I went through a wormhole and I'm in the sea? Yeah,

159
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:38,009
doing the same thing. All right. I'm telling you right now, if you guys fill this cube,

160
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:45,779
you did it. You accomplished it. Congratulations. But I'm taking control back for the rest of the

161
00:28:45,779 --> 00:29:01,180
stream. You beat the game at that point. You get the game over. You see the end credits. That's it.

162
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,220
All of a sudden, everyone's like, no, no, shit. Remove that. Remove, remove it.

163
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,339
He might be serious. Don't fuck with him today. He got it. He played a bootleg

164
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:39,430
Dreamcast game. He's already on edge. I'm gonna get like chat on screen. How do I do this?

165
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:46,359
Can I pin this? How do I pin the chat window on top of this game?

166
00:29:47,079 --> 00:30:16,539
Yeah, I can do that, right? Pin. Pin this window. Customize. How do I pin this? How do I use pin a

167
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:27,140
Firefox tab? Are you guys doing it? You know, you're clearing everything. Good. I actually

168
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:39,740
don't know how fucking I can do this. The large vocal in wrong stream chat. I'm not judging

169
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:50,579
anybody. What are you talking about? Right click the top of the window. All right. While

170
00:30:50,579 --> 00:31:15,369
you guys fill in the same thing over and over again. It's I think an add on. Oh, that is a good

171
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:22,869
one. Daughter of the Cosmos. That is that's probably one of the better songs in the whole

172
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:43,160
soundtrack. All right. I'm about to I'm about to grab the wheel. You guys are falling asleep

173
00:31:43,160 --> 00:32:08,859
here. Like, come on. What is this? Take control back, please. I'm drawing every toss.

174
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,930
Stop. What do you mean stop? You guys you guys just keep going like this.

175
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:39,450
You just did it for me. You just did it while I was showing you. All right. Okay. Why would

176
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:49,109
you clear this? We almost had it. Clean slate. Look, I'll leave what you guys did. There you

177
00:32:49,109 --> 00:33:04,170
go. Oh, good. End the stream. No thoughts on the Halo Master Chief collection coming to

178
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:15,559
steam. That's actually kind of cool because I never really played them. When is that

179
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:34,809
expected to be there? This year there's no date. Oh, that's cool though. Yeah, back when

180
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:40,740
Halo was a big deal. I mean, it's not like it's not anymore, but when it was a really

181
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:49,000
big deal. I didn't have a regular Xbox. I didn't have I had like a 64 PlayStation 2.

182
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:57,099
What is in the Master Chief collection? You guys are going into the second phase.

183
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:10,500
Yeah. All right. It's every single one but up to five. Wow. I thought it was just the

184
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,730
first three. That's kind of cool. Are you guys, are you doing it? Am I about to assume control?

185
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:25,690
That's it. This is going to be it. You win. Congratulations. You filled the cube.

186
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:42,679
Look it. You did it. You see the credits. Here they are. This song.

187
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:05,539
All right. All right. I'm going to fix this. This is a fruit. All right. The question is

188
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:09,800
how much is left in the song? No, I can't beat this in 10 seconds. Never mind. What's

189
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:19,480
next coming up there? What's the next Bloodborne song? No, this is Nicolás.

190
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:32,840
No, this one's too scary. I don't want this one. Cos. Or some say Cosum.

191
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:59,670
Gas coin's a good song. All right. Let me fix this. Boom, boom, boom. We've got five. One,

192
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:06,150
two, three, four, five. This is going to be part of the four. You got one, two, three, four.

193
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:13,190
Can't be here. That's really the only thing I can do. I want you in my room. Why? What are

194
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:22,119
you talking about? Oh, that's the boom, boom, boom, boom. I want you in my room. That song.

195
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:37,670
One space. One, two, three. Play that. I'll play that after this. We're going full on

196
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:44,460
copyright stream. I mean, the title of this is now Throwing the Towel, right?

197
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:57,139
Is that part of the one of the seven? I don't know. Destroy the Vod. No, I don't want to

198
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:13,800
destroy it. Two, two, maybe four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Not quite. Hi, Vod. Can you

199
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:28,309
hear me? That was one, two, three, four ones. It can't be any of these. Give us back

200
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:44,070
control. No. Hmm. I wonder which one this is. This is probably part of the four. Well,

201
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:51,050
this is, I'm going to, yeah, this is four if it's free. This is probably the seven. Yes,

202
00:37:51,050 --> 00:38:03,019
it is. Right until he gives it back. I don't think you're going to get it. Sorry. You beat

203
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:14,380
the game. You did what you were trying to do. Four. What does that do? Five, one, two, three,

204
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:27,820
four, five. Let them play. They did and they won. They did a great job. I was very proud.

205
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:50,170
I was so happy. It was wondrous what they've done. What was it going to put on? Does anybody

206
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,889
know what the name of that song is? Is it just called Boom Boom Boom? Or is it called I Want

207
00:38:54,889 --> 00:39:17,659
You In My Room? There it is. This is the one that goes. We like to party. We like

208
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:41,449
to party. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Right? No, it's different. Look, I already threw in the towel.

209
00:39:42,010 --> 00:40:14,940
I don't even have to explain myself louder. I'm not going to pretend. I know that part.

210
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:41,659
Here it comes. And then here's the Minecraft part. Yep. What is it?

211
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:07,139
So, um, last night when I was going to bed. Oh, I forgot to tell you about my dream. Oh

212
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,460
my God. Is that this dream is fucking worth sticking around for. I hope you stayed here

213
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,659
from the beginning of the stream. If you left and you were like, oh fuck, this is

214
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:18,260
kind of all fucked up. We'll try again tomorrow. No, you've stuck around for this long. You're

215
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,380
going to get one of the most ridiculous dreams I've ever had. So listen to this.

216
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:32,019
I'm in my bedroom and there's a knock at my door. I go to look through the people

217
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:36,019
and there's a bunch of company. Oh, fuck. Oh, there's people coming over. Oh,

218
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:40,099
my house is not ready. Oh, just a minute. Right. Hold on a second. And I'm like picking

219
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:45,219
up underwear on the floor and grabbing shit and throwing stuff in the laundry. What's over here?

220
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:53,619
Sweep, sweep. Right. There is dog shit all over the floor and all outside. Right. So I'm

221
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:59,940
picking up shit with my bare hands. Just picking up like pile of like auto shit,

222
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,820
pile of auto shit, pile of auto shit. And I go to answer the door

223
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:12,420
and I'm cupping like five or six shits in my hand. Like to try to magician hide them,

224
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,699
like as if they're not there. It stinks wicked fucking bad. It's unbearable.

225
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:24,420
And I'm holding them like down below behind me. And I open the door and everyone kind of

226
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,739
starts to come in like, oh, hey, how are you? Oh, good to see you again. Yeah. Well,

227
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,300
you put that you put your jacket over there. And I have like a lot of shit in my hand

228
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:39,059
and nobody really knows yet. I spend the next what seemed to be 20 to 30 straight minutes.

229
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,940
I couldn't get out. I couldn't like sneak out to the bathroom. I couldn't go upstairs.

230
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,420
I couldn't. No, no, no, no. I'm greeting people coming in and like hiding this fucking

231
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,070
baseball of shit. And everybody I'm doing so good. I'm getting the hang of this.

232
00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:01,190
No one is stopping to like look at my hand. This is brain power. We already heard this.

233
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:08,099
So finally, I get an opportunity to like, yeah, oh, hey, hi, Mary. How are you? I have to hug

234
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:12,340
this lady. Like, oh, she comes in for a hug. I got to what I what am I gonna do?

235
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,980
I've got two hands here. One of them is has a wad of dog shit. So I put my hand around and

236
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:24,519
do like the hover hand on one side and like pat with the right hand. Now, somebody else looks

237
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:30,650
over here and sees what's happening. What's in my hand. And I have this little like,

238
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,489
yeah, but they didn't. I don't know. I don't think they really grasped what it was. They just,

239
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:39,670
I kind of had like eye beams going towards my left hand. It was holding like a martini glass.

240
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,070
Like, what the fuck is she doing? And I'm like, I'll be right back. And I run into the

241
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,150
bathroom. Then I finally get in there. And I think I'm like safe. And I just like this.

242
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,780
I go like this, right? I go like into the toilet. I don't know why I could have just

243
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:03,050
placed it but I like I like yo yo it down like into the fucking toilet. And my hand is just

244
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:13,980
it's just caked with shit. And that's when I woke up. Glad he stuck around for that one.

245
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,860
It was the most panic induced and I thought it was real, right? You everybody you always

246
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:25,239
think a dream is real while it's happening. But somewhere in that halfway to end of that

247
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:34,360
dream, I like I could feel that people knew what was going on. And that's the panic there.

248
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:53,019
I forgot it was a dream. I was there for that. No, it was fucking ridiculous. And first of all,

249
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:57,019
the number one thing you have to remember. Why is there a party going on at my house? Why

250
00:44:57,019 --> 00:45:01,500
are there like a dozen fucking people coming in one after the other shaking hands? And why

251
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,260
is this shit all over my whole house? Like dog poo everywhere? What kind of fucked up slob

252
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:16,139
am I? And then I thought about it. And after I'm streaming tomorrow, but after tomorrow,

253
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:19,260
I'm going to be taking like probably three or four days off because I have like friends

254
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:30,300
coming up. Maybe that's why I had that dream. That's probably why. Anyways, back to the

255
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:36,809
back to the game. So I'm going to Yeah, it's a prophecy. Just make sure there's no

256
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:48,150
fucking dog shit all over the place. Take auto out. I have such weird dreams. My dreams

257
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:54,150
always just don't make any sense. I told you guys about the Gordon Ramsay one where

258
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,070
I didn't know if we were going to split the bill or not, right? That happened like last week,

259
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:09,579
two weeks ago. What the fuck am I? What's wrong with my brain? This one kind of got me here.

260
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:20,139
Six, one, two, three, four, five, six. Get that on this one. This one's five. So one,

261
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:29,690
two, this can be blocked. Is this the legendary PictoPix streamer? Yeah. I wouldn't say

262
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:56,150
legendary. What am I doing? You're legendary to me. Thank you. Thanks. No, seriously. Thank you.

263
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,750
So tomorrow on tomorrow's stream, we're probably going to have a little bit better luck.

264
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,420
I have a couple of plans for tomorrow. We'll see if they happen or not. I'm not done

265
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:26,150
streaming tonight. Don't worry. It's still going. Is that going to? No, is that impossible

266
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,630
for me to do that? One, two, three. No, I can't figure that out from here. One, two,

267
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:37,579
three, four, five. No. All right. I got one, two, three. One, two, three. Let's just mark X's.

268
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:54,739
It's not really going to help that much, but it's okay. Two, one, four, five, six. One, two,

269
00:47:54,739 --> 00:48:01,300
three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Same deal on this one. Now the

270
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,460
question is, is this one, two, three, four, five? No, this is part of the five.

271
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:21,579
There's two, four, five. Close it. Wow. You've walked the span. Thanks. Idiot.

272
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:33,769
Huh? Oh, there's this people are spamming the song. I get it. I get it. I forgot there was

273
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:40,519
music playing. This is wrong. One, two, three, four, five, six. What happened here? This is

274
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:55,420
wrong. How did I do this? Oh, fuck. This is completely wrong. Shit. What was the last

275
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:08,780
thing I did? Uh-oh. Oh, no. What did I do wrong here? That's two, right? Two. Let me

276
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,659
just do, I think I can fix it a little bit later. Let me just see what happens here.

277
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:20,659
One of these rows is wrong, but it's okay. Two, two, uh-oh. No, this is the row that's

278
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:35,179
wrong. That's why. Okay. Because this has to be two down like that. All right. I got it.

279
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:49,159
I think I fixed it. Two, two, one. This is so wrong. How did I fuck this up this badly?

280
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,789
This is so, look at how incorrect this is. One, two, three, four, five. What?

281
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:30,139
Something went so horribly wrong. Oh, I gotta restart it. Sometimes you just have to detonate

282
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:45,139
it and come and do it again. What's next? I don't know what this is. I'm so unreasonably

283
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:53,269
sad about Space Channel. Me too. It's okay, though. Can't happen every time. Even if

284
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:58,949
you plan something, it doesn't matter. It's okay. There's always next time. You know,

285
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:02,789
there's always another day. Don't worry. Everything's fine. I'm good. I feel great.

286
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:12,119
I feel great right now. I really do. What's another good, what's another little soundtrack?

287
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:33,639
Put on the Six Flags song? We like to party, right? Put on the Venga bus. You know,

288
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:40,309
people ask career advice sometimes. And what, what I should do, what, if you had advice,

289
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:48,739
Jerma, what would it be? Honest to fucking God, write a song that is catchy as fuck

290
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:55,820
and collect royalties for the next 2000 years. Your entire family will be,

291
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,289
just make a song like this. Just make one song that everybody that plays on Six Flags

292
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:06,250
commercials only need, you need one. You don't need an album full of great music. Just make

293
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:21,449
one good song and then Seinfeld it until you die. Just spend every waking moment of your life

294
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:30,099
trying to come up with one catchy song. That's pretty bad advice. Don't take that advice.

295
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:50,179
Collected fucking royalties forever, forever. We get a check for like a hundred thousand

296
00:52:50,179 --> 00:53:15,849
dollars every year for this one fucking song. All right. I gotta pay attention. That's wrong.

297
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:29,340
And paid now happiness is just around the corner. Three thousand people are doing it right.

298
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:38,170
What? Let me, I got, I, I'm, this song is getting me. It's just catchy.

299
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:44,659
All right. So we've got five, two, I screwed it up here last time.

300
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:59,289
That's how I fucked it up before. Now I understand. Because I did five, five,

301
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:09,510
one instead of five, one down. That's where it all went so wrong. There we go. Fixed.

302
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:49,019
What does that say when you guys went to Six Flags? Now do it at time at 50% speed. Is it

303
00:54:49,019 --> 00:55:15,539
still fun? It sounds like a different song. Don't you just want to fucking make this go

304
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,980
faster? In my brain, it's trying to be as fast as it should be and it's not letting it.

305
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:30,659
I hate this. This has to be here. One, two, three, because there's no way,

306
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,900
even if it's five or even the way this might be five here, then I'm,

307
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:56,840
no, okay. Even if this is the end, two has to be here. Four, four, three, five. All right.

308
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:10,139
I got it now. I'm going to look, people are going to leave. I've gained viewers since the

309
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:19,610
song has been on. Huh. See if that cult strip will go in point five, boys and girls.

310
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:56,409
All right. That hurt. That's giving me like anxiety. I need to stop doing that.

311
00:56:56,409 --> 00:57:38,070
Oh, God damn it. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's not what I wanted today.

312
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:51,530
This is not what I wanted. Did anybody get it right? Okay. I'm stopping this.

313
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:58,460
No, some of you guys got it right. I want to do, let's do like a 15 by 15. Let's,

314
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,940
let's get a, let's do like a 20 by 20. Let's get a real one.

315
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:48,139
Why is this so slow? Oh, right. Cause it's still, what's going on? Dude, times two speed.

316
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:58,619
No, I want people to keep their brain cells, pump it up. No, I don't want to be that loud.

317
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:13,000
I'm going to wake up my neighbors. I want you in my room. Wait, boom, boom, boom, boom.

318
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,960
I want you in my room. We'll spend the night together to get there in my room.

319
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:40,070
Boom. What? This is the same song. That's where I, that's, I'm going to call it there

320
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:49,320
right there. What else? What's this one? The coconut song. What does it say? 69 million

321
00:59:49,320 --> 01:00:18,900
views. What is this? The coconut song. 70 million views. I don't see the appeal.

322
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:30,630
All right. What's this one? It just says coconut, coconut, coconut, coconut.

323
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:41,219
What the fuck is this stream? This is called throwing in the towel.

324
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,639
Let's all right. Fine. I'll give them another chance.

325
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:02,380
All right. This is actually, I like it.

326
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:29,190
Big, big nut, but this delicious nut is not a nut. This is probably one. Yeah, this is one.

327
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,389
No, I don't know. It might not be.

328
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:37,670
I don't have a lot of info to go on on this one.

329
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:56,329
I don't have any info. I got, I have info for this one, two, three, one, two, three.

330
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:02,420
I just don't know. This is 70 million views.

331
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:09,670
I need more info.

332
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:23,980
Where's my nut button? That's a good question.

333
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,980
I'm stuck here on this one.

334
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:42,869
Because pretty much anywhere I go would be technically incorrect without just guessing.

335
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:49,099
Let's just assume that this is one. Does that help us at all?

336
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,929
It kind of does. Assuming that this is one and not one, two.

337
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:10,070
That's a great song, but I can't, I need to think. What else we got here?

338
01:03:16,469 --> 01:03:20,949
It was just getting good. No crazy frog. I did Beat Saber crazy frog. I'm not going

339
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:35,539
back to that hill. No, not the duck song. I always never liked that song.

340
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:49,260
You can always put the left cross regardless of one and two. Yeah, that's true.

341
01:03:54,489 --> 01:04:00,460
I got one for you. I'm going to play this.

342
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,099
Everybody here right now, maybe you have some questions on whether or not.

343
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,139
I don't know if I like this guy. I've been here for a little while.

344
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:11,739
Maybe I've been around for a long time, but I'm having doubts that maybe this guy

345
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:14,300
knows how to run a stream or not. What a fucking idiot.

346
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,699
I'm about to change everyone's opinion because you're going to hear me play this

347
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:21,260
song and you're going to go, I automatically enjoy everything he's ever said or ever will do

348
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:26,760
or ever will say. Okay. Just making sure you guys are aware of that right now.

349
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:59,750
So that goes to see it for now. All right. We're good. Oops. Oops. Oops.

350
01:05:00,389 --> 01:06:12,010
All right. It's 60%. That's fine. That's fine. I got a better idea. How about now?

351
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:30,300
How about now? What is it? How many people said, 27% said highly negative.

352
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:48,059
I mean, you did that for the joke. I appreciate it nonetheless.

353
01:06:48,619 --> 01:07:06,469
Another remix of this song. Play the right version. What do you mean the right version?

354
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:20,579
All versions are good. Every version of this song is fantastic. This is incorrect.

355
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:44,360
What song is it? This is the moon theme from DuckTales Remastered.

356
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:55,050
Who knows what's coming up next? All right. Did I blow this? I may have.

357
01:07:55,769 --> 01:08:07,539
Has to be here. I may have blown this. I'm not going to say I didn't.

358
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:27,000
I blew it. Maybe not. I blew it. What have I done?

359
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:46,819
Two busy pincers in the mood. Restarted. All right. I fucked it up. That's good.

360
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:58,420
It's okay. It's okay. Where was the first one? What have I done? I don't remember.

361
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:03,989
One. One, two, three, four. Block it. One, two, three, four. Block this.

362
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:12,630
This is just JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. No, no, no. I was about to mute it.

363
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:35,510
But she better be Smash Brothers DLC. Seriously. I don't want another Fire Emblem character.

364
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:50,489
The song is very bad. I didn't say it. You didn't.

365
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,979
All right. I got to pay attention to my fucking newspaper game from the 80s.

366
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,479
Distraction. Distracting. Distracting. Distracting.

367
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,800
What did I do the last time? I did... It was five. I don't remember.

368
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,319
This is assuming this is one, right?

369
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:45,539
Because then... No. No. This is not right. It's not correct.

370
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:52,659
You have all the info to solve Row B. I know, but I keep hearing jump into the air.

371
01:10:54,550 --> 01:11:01,989
And my fucking split personality brain is dancing right now. There's a part of my brain

372
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:05,829
that is doing like the swing. Like, oh, hey, spin around. Grab that person by the arm.

373
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:09,590
Go around. Like the tap dancing and shit. And then there's another part that's sitting

374
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:16,619
here trying to do math. There's two people sitting here right now.

375
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:19,899
One of them is having a great time dancing at some fucking wedding.

376
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:30,630
And the other one's playing a game on stream. I'm just ripped in half.

377
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:37,020
All right. So that means... So we got one, two, three, four. I had it last time.

378
01:11:41,829 --> 01:11:50,500
B7... It can't be there. I mean, it could because that's one and then space two.

379
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:57,500
Stop. I have to stop. I have to get out. I have to leave the wedding.

380
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,460
All right. Come back to me. Come on. Like, back in.

381
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,380
Sit in here. I need both of you here. Not just one.

382
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:14,899
Together. I'm like Majin Boo. Just all of you get back in here

383
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:19,739
for like a couple minutes and then I promise you can just go back to what you were doing.

384
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:29,220
Okay. So this is one, two, three. One, two, three. Let's get rid of...

385
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:33,640
No, I don't know. Okay. This? No. We're here.

386
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:44,010
One, two, three, four. I just don't know which side this is on. It can't be this.

387
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,090
Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. Everything's fine.

388
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:56,600
See? He sat back down. So then that's three, one.

389
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:06,869
Now the question is, where's this other three? So this is the one.

390
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:14,229
Yeah. This could... Okay. There's your four, right? One, two, three, four.

391
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:21,460
One, two, three, four. Hold on. One, two, three, four.

392
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,939
I don't know that info. Pull that back for a second.

393
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:30,520
Two, three, four. One, two, three, four. I don't know that info.

394
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:43,340
Okay. That leaves us with one. I have it now.

395
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:51,060
Okay. All right. Go ahead. Go. You can go. You can go. You can go.

396
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:54,180
You can go. Are you sure? Yeah, you're fine.

397
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,640
Just if I need you again, I'll call you back. Really?

398
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,399
Yeah. Go on. Thanks, man.

399
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:01,399
Right. All right. Come here. You're not breaking it.

400
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:16,199
Thanks a lot, man. Go have fun.

401
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:21,619
Two, three. No, I fucked it up again.

402
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,460
I need you. Stop. Get back here. No. Get back in. Get back in.

403
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,420
Stop, stop, stop. Back, back, back, back. Get back in here.

404
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,050
This is going to be three. This is wrong.

405
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:35,640
This has to be three. This is incorrect.

406
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:43,109
You see what I'm talking about? What did I do again that was wrong?

407
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:47,289
Because see, this is what it was. This is impossible.

408
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:48,729
That's not possible, but that can't be right.

409
01:14:49,289 --> 01:15:04,500
So this is just wrong. And the question is, where did it go wrong?

410
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:21,739
Where did it go so this is wrong? Let me just pull this back.

411
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:28,310
God damn it. Am I pretending?

412
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,069
No. I'm just tired.

413
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:41,300
It went wrong with D7, did it? I got fucking restarted again.

414
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,079
Every time I see it because blah.

415
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,239
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, right?

416
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

417
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

418
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,079
We have this because of this information.

419
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:12,630
That's all I have right now. That's what it was before.

420
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:17,159
So now this is where it goes off the rails for me every time.

421
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,640
And I don't know why. Sometimes, okay, I blow through

422
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,199
some of these and then some of them, I just get stuck.

423
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,000
So there's no, four has to be here.

424
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,760
It has to be one, two, three, four.

425
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:31,100
This is what it has to be.

426
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,409
This is as far as I got before it was just...

427
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,880
Now this is also, this is a one.

428
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,560
That's the middle one. There's one down here.

429
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,239
And then three is up here somewhere.

430
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:56,359
All right. Now three...

431
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,220
Wait, are you shitting me?

432
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:06,619
I think I just got it right there.

433
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:15,590
I think I just got it wrong.

434
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:26,220
Is it wrong? Why am I crossing out D5?

435
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,189
Because look, see?

436
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:34,149
It's three, because I think this is the one, right?

437
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,079
Otherwise, this can't be the three.

438
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:40,039
This can't be the last one.

439
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:41,079
This is the middle one.

440
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:43,079
D5 is getting crossed out because it's the one.

441
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,510
It could be the three.

442
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:49,430
But if no, if it's a three, one, two, three, one, one.

443
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,390
No, it can't be the three.

444
01:17:51,029 --> 01:17:52,119
Three is above here.

445
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:57,369
One, two, three, because then there's a space, ones.

446
01:17:57,369 --> 01:17:58,489
But I mean, I guess it could.

447
01:17:58,489 --> 01:17:59,529
Yes, it could. It could.

448
01:18:00,329 --> 01:18:04,340
Because then this would be this.

449
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:10,659
No, but that doesn't work either, see?

450
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,210
Because now it has to be here.

451
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,000
Which would then be one, which is impossible.

452
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,119
See what I'm saying?

453
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:32,340
Because if it's three, then one, then one.

454
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,460
So if it was like that,

455
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,680
then that would mean it would have to be either here or here.

456
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:38,520
And if it's here, no.

457
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,000
If it's here, you only got one, one.

458
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,800
You can't do two here.

459
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,569
It's probably this.

460
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:01,899
That's realistically, because then let's take a look.

461
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,560
That covers that.

462
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,520
Here's this row.

463
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,640
Let me just see what that looks like now.

464
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:19,140
Okay, that looks right.

465
01:19:22,789 --> 01:19:23,430
Yeah, that's right.

466
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,550
Okay, we're good.

467
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:29,000
Fucking puzzle, man.

468
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:44,140
One, two, three, four.

469
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:47,640
One, two, one, two, three, four.

470
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,949
All right, now the question is,

471
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:54,869
is this where that way?

472
01:19:54,869 --> 01:19:55,510
I don't know yet.

473
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,890
But this is five.

474
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:01,449
So one, two, three, four, five.

475
01:20:01,449 --> 01:20:03,210
One, two, three, four, five.

476
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:10,420
Five, I believe is correct.

477
01:20:11,529 --> 01:20:17,189
Which would be one, and then three, right?

478
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:21,960
Okay, and that ends this, and that ends that.

479
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,859
What's coming up next?

480
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:29,180
A cowboy bebop, apparently.

481
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,840
All right, now we can do this.

482
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,760
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

483
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:49,930
Here's the four has to be right here.

484
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:52,329
It's a two.

485
01:20:52,970 --> 01:21:02,920
All right, that's done.

486
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:04,119
This is done.

487
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:07,699
And here's the two.

488
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,539
And then here's the two.

489
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,340
Beautiful is the one.

490
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:16,020
All right, what the hell?

491
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,460
What animal is this?

492
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,420
That took a long time.

493
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,479
Oh, is it a rooster?

494
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:35,829
That was not a chicken.

495
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:36,470
It could have been.

496
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,029
All right, what we got?

497
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:42,710
Seven, eight, nine.

498
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,869
We can go, let's see, one.

499
01:21:44,869 --> 01:21:47,189
So just by deducing it with our logical brains.

500
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:49,500
Let's just say one is here.

501
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:51,500
That's space one.

502
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,939
So let's mark this just for a second.

503
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:55,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

504
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,399
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

505
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,800
One, two, three, four.

506
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,920
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

507
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,239
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

508
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:12,180
Got big bits coming.

509
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:13,220
I missed it.

510
01:22:13,939 --> 01:22:18,100
Oh, Jesus, Freudian weapon.

511
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:25,369
Freudian weapon has just earned the 50,000 bits badge.

512
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,739
50,000.

513
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:34,550
Thank you for the 50 bucks.

514
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,829
5,000 bits, Freudian.

515
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:36,630
Really appreciate it.

516
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,859
And thank you for the 50 fucking thousand.

517
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,479
This song is terrible.

518
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:44,039
Skip it.

519
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:45,880
All right, one guy and you get to be the one guy sometimes.

520
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:52,380
What is it?

521
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,500
The whiplash soundtrack?

522
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,460
What is this?

523
01:22:54,460 --> 01:23:00,600
I don't know.

524
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,609
This is more whiplash.

525
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm thinking whatever.

526
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,039
This is just jazz.

527
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,060
But thank you, Freudian, for your massive contributions to the stream.

528
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,460
That's a shitload of money.

529
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,779
I can never expect somebody to fucking pay me that much money.

530
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:28,279
Thank you.

531
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,319
Is this their influence?

532
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:45,020
So we get two somewhere in here.

533
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:51,930
Two, one, one, one, three, three.

534
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:53,050
So we got this blocked off.

535
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:53,850
This helps us a little.

536
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:54,810
One, two, three.

537
01:23:55,689 --> 01:23:58,500
And then down here.

538
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,539
One, two, three.

539
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,300
All right.

540
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,659
That's all I have for now.

541
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:12,579
Two, two, two, one.

542
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,770
What else do I got here?

543
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:18,069
This is probably the one.

544
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:18,550
It is.

545
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:19,050
All right.

546
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,029
Well, there's the next way, that two.

547
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,779
Which then brings us to three.

548
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:25,579
And then two.

549
01:24:25,579 --> 01:24:26,060
There it is.

550
01:24:26,779 --> 01:24:30,340
So we got three and three again.

551
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,460
One, two, three.

552
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,100
Space.

553
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:34,619
Yeah.

554
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:35,340
One, two, three.

555
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:35,659
Space.

556
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:36,380
One, two, three.

557
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,720
This is an animal again.

558
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:49,800
We got two.

559
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,439
Two fucked it up again.

560
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:53,479
He fucked it up again.

561
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,189
Fucked it up again.

562
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:23,399
What did I do?

563
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,199
It's right here somewhere.

564
01:25:26,199 --> 01:25:26,680
Let me think.

565
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:29,619
I went too fast.

566
01:25:29,619 --> 01:25:34,520
So this is one, three, two.

567
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:39,899
So hold on a minute here.

568
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:40,460
This can't...

569
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:44,630
No, this is fucked up.

570
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:09,720
No.

571
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:11,579
What am I missing?

572
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:13,260
I've got to go backwards again.

573
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:23,289
Let me see.

574
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:28,340
Bye.

575
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:28,659
Okay.

576
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:28,979
Hold on.

577
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:29,619
What happened there?

578
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:33,909
One.

579
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:37,449
Right, this is wrong.

580
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:46,920
One.

581
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,640
Is this...

582
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,199
This is still...

583
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:48,760
I don't think this is...

584
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,960
This is not right.

585
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,840
This is wrong here.

586
01:26:57,939 --> 01:26:58,420
No.

587
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,300
It's all fucked up.

588
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,340
I did something fucking stupid somewhere.

589
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,770
I have to do it again.

590
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:20,250
I have to go...

591
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:20,970
I got to reset it.

592
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:25,670
I just fucking peed my pants.

593
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:32,300
Let me start again.

594
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:34,310
All right.

595
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:35,189
I can't handle this.

596
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,510
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

597
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:44,489
One space.

598
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,859
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

599
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:51,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

600
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:52,619
One.

601
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:53,260
There it is.

602
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:53,659
All right.

603
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:54,619
Where did I go again?

604
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:06,859
Boomer needs a diaper.

605
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:09,800
I probably will after this.

606
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:14,359
Just hand it over to the 70-year-old lady

607
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:16,680
who comes into my olive garden at 11 a.m. every single day.

608
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,039
She solves these like they're nothing.

609
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,670
Well, I'm going to make that joke funnier

610
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,109
because that's probably...

611
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:25,829
She probably does it for seven hours a day every single day.

612
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:30,199
She's probably done every single Picross puzzle that has ever...

613
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:32,949
She's probably done 50,000 of them.

614
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:34,949
She's been doing that since she was like 52.

615
01:28:36,039 --> 01:28:38,359
She's got two decades of fucking experience.

616
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,439
She may as well get signed to a fucking esports team.

617
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:46,229
Anyways, where were we?

618
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,550
One.

619
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:47,029
There it is.

620
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:55,579
Big brained grandma.

621
01:28:58,619 --> 01:28:59,420
Okay.

622
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,140
This is done.

623
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:03,050
I went off the rails here somewhere.

624
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,930
Let's find out how.

625
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,659
This is probably not...

626
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:09,659
This might be the one or that might be part of the three.

627
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:10,380
No, it's not.

628
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,539
Got to fill it all in.

629
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:13,039
Okay.

630
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,279
One.

631
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:28,300
This has to be the one because this is one.

632
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,180
It has to be that.

633
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,810
So now...

634
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:52,069
Do I miss Boston?

635
01:29:52,069 --> 01:29:53,750
Sometimes, yeah, depending.

636
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:01,590
How is C7 filled in?

637
01:30:03,609 --> 01:30:05,850
Because, well, this is what I did.

638
01:30:06,649 --> 01:30:08,329
So if it's seven space one,

639
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:11,210
then you have to assume that there's a one and there's a space.

640
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:13,770
So let's just say it's here.

641
01:30:14,569 --> 01:30:16,470
There has to be a space here.

642
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:18,949
Therefore, the seven has to be somewhere in here.

643
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:22,569
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

644
01:30:22,569 --> 01:30:24,729
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

645
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:36,300
So that's why this is filled right now.

646
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,100
Good, Jeremy.

647
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:37,819
Very good.

648
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,739
Yes, I used my brain.

649
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:43,720
So now...

650
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,920
All right, let me focus for a second.

651
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:48,699
Two, one.

652
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:50,060
And that looks pretty perfect, but...

653
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:51,930
Because I had the...

654
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,930
Last time it was two, I had the two filled in here.

655
01:30:55,109 --> 01:30:56,149
And it's probably here.

656
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,369
What a smart lad.

657
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:14,659
Okay, I'm on the right track here.

658
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:15,060
So that's...

659
01:31:15,779 --> 01:31:16,899
There's the two, yep.

660
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:18,340
So this is where I went wrong before.

661
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:27,850
Can't be here.

662
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:31,640
So this has to be over here.

663
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:41,939
So then this two is down here somewhere.

664
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:48,869
There it is.

665
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:52,569
And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

666
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,250
I finally got my brain around this one.

667
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:05,289
Don't know any of these yet.

668
01:32:05,289 --> 01:32:06,569
So one, hold on, one.

669
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:12,680
One, two, three.

670
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,039
So one, two, three.

671
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:14,920
One, two, three.

672
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,729
The two is done.

673
01:32:18,729 --> 01:32:19,449
There goes this route.

674
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:20,569
All right, let's get it.

675
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:21,289
Let's speed it up.

676
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,689
You guys have had lots of time to guess this one.

677
01:32:29,659 --> 01:32:32,739
Two, there's the three.

678
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:39,180
But you haven't had any idea what the hell it is.

679
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,300
Two, two.

680
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,220
Two, one.

681
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:48,579
Three, three.

682
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,399
Two is there somewhere.

683
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:55,350
One, two.

684
01:32:57,449 --> 01:32:58,250
All right.

685
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,210
Two, two.

686
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:00,489
One, two, two.

687
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:02,489
One, two, one, two.

688
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,479
One, two.

689
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,119
Two, two.

690
01:33:08,119 --> 01:33:09,560
Two, one, two, one.

691
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,119
One, two.

692
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,140
Two, two, one.

693
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:17,130
It's going to be surprised Pikachu.

694
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:20,100
One, two, three, four.

695
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,220
One, two, three, four.

696
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,220
That does that.

697
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,020
See you later.

698
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:25,659
See you later.

699
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:27,100
See you later.

700
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:28,699
Okay, see you later.

701
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,319
And see you later.

702
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:33,800
Finally.

703
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:36,699
Finally.

704
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:38,140
This dope did it.

705
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,449
Here, play, keep talking and nobody explodes.

706
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,050
I actually own it for VR.

707
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,659
I'm going to wait till nobody wants to play.

708
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,710
Anybody get it?

709
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:50,149
There's a wolf.

710
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:55,800
I don't think anybody got it.

711
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah, but I do own it for VR.

712
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,840
You'll see it at some point.

713
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:07,500
Got some free filled in ones.

714
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,140
That's good.

715
01:34:08,859 --> 01:34:15,590
Which leads us, that's two.

716
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:15,909
Okay.

717
01:34:17,529 --> 01:34:19,050
That's five, one, five, two.

718
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,170
Two, one, one, two.

719
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,090
All right, what can we work with now?

720
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:30,279
Well, it has to be here.

721
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:34,340
And then that has to be there.

722
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,090
Good to know.

723
01:34:36,729 --> 01:34:38,100
That's also part of a one.

724
01:34:38,899 --> 01:34:41,779
This is three.

725
01:34:41,779 --> 01:34:43,060
That's a one, four, one.

726
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:48,920
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

727
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,880
Not quite.

728
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:50,920
Not quite.

729
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,890
Two, two, one.

730
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:55,529
I don't know.

731
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,460
I don't know any of these yet.

732
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,350
That one's empty.

733
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,500
Five, this is part of five.

734
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,939
One, two, three, four, five.

735
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,180
One, two, three, four, five.

736
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:13,420
Okay.

737
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,069
Three, that's part of the four.

738
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:17,189
That's part of the two.

739
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:19,029
That's part of the three, I'm going to assume.

740
01:35:19,829 --> 01:35:23,750
No, no, music.

741
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,229
Right, right, right.

742
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:24,710
Sorry, sorry.

743
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:25,109
My bad.

744
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:33,909
I apologize already.

745
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:45,609
Right, Megan?

746
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:46,409
Yeah!

747
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:48,970
You say that just once you'd like your hamburger hot

748
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:51,130
and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp

749
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:52,569
all at the same time.

750
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:53,289
Yeah!

751
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,130
Well, I say you got it.

752
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,689
I'm talking McDonald's and lettuce and tomato hamburger.

753
01:35:57,689 --> 01:35:58,729
The McDLT.

754
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:02,250
I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side.

755
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:04,329
Stays hot.

756
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:06,010
The new McDLT.

757
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:06,649
Hot, hot.

758
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:08,890
Less lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side.

759
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:10,970
Stays cool.

760
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,409
The new McDLT.

761
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:14,649
The cool stays hot.

762
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:16,010
The cool stays crisp.

763
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,890
Put it together.

764
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:18,329
You can't resist.

765
01:36:18,329 --> 01:36:19,449
The hottest taste.

766
01:36:19,449 --> 01:36:20,810
The coolest crunch.

767
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:21,609
Hot, hot.

768
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,890
Keep it cool, cool.

769
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:24,170
McDLT.

770
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,289
McDLT.

771
01:36:25,289 --> 01:36:26,489
Hot beefy McD.

772
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,609
Cool, crisp, L-T.

773
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:28,170
McD.

774
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:29,850
L-T.

775
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,130
It's a good time.

776
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:32,250
Hot beefy McD.

777
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,449
With a great taste.

778
01:36:33,449 --> 01:36:34,569
Cool, crisp, L-T.

779
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:35,529
At McDonald's!

780
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:55,239
Okay.

781
01:36:55,239 --> 01:37:03,180
So I gotta mark the ones.

782
01:37:03,739 --> 01:37:06,539
Which there are a couple that I didn't do, right?

783
01:37:11,609 --> 01:37:15,609
This is the three.

784
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:18,869
Because it's not one, two, three.

785
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:24,439
So it's probably one, two, three, or one, two, three.

786
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,899
Can we go back to McDonald's?

787
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:36,460
No.

788
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:47,060
Three is?

789
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:53,000
Hope you have a nice relaxing Friday afternoon.

790
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,340
What's today's date?

791
01:37:55,659 --> 01:37:56,699
Friday night.

792
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:59,510
I'm your master of ceremonies.

793
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:00,229
German on eight, five.

794
01:38:00,949 --> 01:38:07,430
Dylan Jacobs.

795
01:38:07,989 --> 01:38:12,579
Grew up in the southernmost port of Mississippi.

796
01:38:13,539 --> 01:38:19,640
Learned to play the guitar when he was eight years old.

797
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,880
Gonna have a selection for you here.

798
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:26,180
Her it is.

799
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:28,920
Mom makes a really mean apple pie.

800
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,880
Be in the studio shortly.

801
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:33,239
With us tonight.

802
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:44,060
But first I gotta get done with this P-Cross level.

803
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:54,739
All right, where am I going?

804
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:55,460
Here, here, here.

805
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:57,979
P-Cross?

806
01:38:57,979 --> 01:38:58,779
It is P-Cross.

807
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:01,239
It's P-Cross.

808
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,739
Two, two, four, one, four.

809
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:24,140
One, one, two, one, two, three, two, one.

810
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,029
What the hell is this?

811
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:27,670
Floral?

812
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:36,260
All right, I gotta slow down because I'm feeling I'm in

813
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,340
at a kind of insane pace.

814
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:38,739
I need to...

815
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,880
And then what an insane pace he's going at.

816
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:48,199
Slowly hover his head over and press that one.

817
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:49,560
I'm going at an insane pace.

818
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:54,359
What did you say before?

819
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:55,399
Like Arby's grandma?

820
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:04,300
No.

821
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,859
I solved all the ten...

822
01:40:06,859 --> 01:40:07,420
Is that eggs?

823
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:12,380
How did you get daisies?

824
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,060
Five, six of you got daisies right.

825
01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:17,430
All right.

826
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:19,189
15 by 15.

827
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:20,149
These are gonna take a while.

828
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,430
13, 14, 15, therefore two.

829
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:43,319
No, I don't know that yet.

830
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:47,640
One, let's just cover these up.

831
01:40:51,029 --> 01:40:52,069
That felt pretty good.

832
01:40:52,069 --> 01:40:53,029
This is empty now.

833
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,579
What song am I playing?

834
01:40:55,579 --> 01:40:59,180
This is background chill-out music.

835
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:01,979
Music for relaxed study, work, relaxing jazz music.

836
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:04,229
There's a coffee cup on the counter.

837
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:11,100
Resident sleeper.

838
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,699
Well, just relax.

839
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,689
What have you got going on today?

840
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,630
If you have something to do, somewhere to go,

841
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,550
or maybe if you got nowhere to be at all.

842
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:26,710
But if you are going out, skip it.

843
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:27,189
Stay here.

844
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,520
Watch your 33-year-old moron

845
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:34,810
try to complete 80-year-old Arby's grandmother's puzzles.

846
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:56,520
Olive Garden, not Arby's.

847
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,720
Why do I keep saying Arby's?

848
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,329
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

849
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:06,229
Reminds me of a story.

850
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:14,979
I'm not going to tell a story.

851
01:42:14,979 --> 01:42:16,260
No, don't.

852
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:16,819
Who cares?

853
01:42:22,789 --> 01:42:29,800
There's lots of ones here.

854
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:36,199
There's your three.

855
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:37,159
There's your second three.

856
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,020
And there's, is that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

857
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,100
Start-up top.

858
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,250
Six.

859
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:47,289
These are all six.

860
01:42:47,289 --> 01:42:47,770
All of them.

861
01:42:51,689 --> 01:42:52,489
Nice.

862
01:42:52,489 --> 01:42:56,579
All right, what about the bottom here?

863
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:58,939
We've got five, one.

864
01:42:59,739 --> 01:43:01,289
This one.

865
01:43:01,289 --> 01:43:02,569
That row's done, okay.

866
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:06,500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

867
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:09,850
It's full.

868
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:10,649
That's full.

869
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:10,970
Full.

870
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:14,140
Three ones.

871
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,939
That's a seven.

872
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,239
Three and then the one.

873
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:20,520
This is all full already.

874
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:20,840
Seven.

875
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:22,760
This is a computer.

876
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:26,550
Some form of computer, guys.

877
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:32,439
There's seven in here.

878
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,260
That looks pretty done to me.

879
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:38,010
And it does.

880
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:42,539
Oh, it's a floppy!

881
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:43,039
Floppy!

882
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:47,979
Nice.

883
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:53,880
This one's already done for me.

884
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,479
I didn't even vote a baby level.

885
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:57,590
15 by 15.

886
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:00,310
You sure it's not like eight by six?

887
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,760
Well, I even have this as a 15 by 15 level.

888
01:44:09,289 --> 01:44:11,689
All right, so we have six here.

889
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:13,689
One, two, three, four, five, six.

890
01:44:14,659 --> 01:44:17,350
I mean, it can just be this whole fucking thing.

891
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:27,590
Any more sixes?

892
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:28,390
There are.

893
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:32,260
Any more sixes?

894
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:34,010
Or high numbers?

895
01:44:34,649 --> 01:44:38,180
What about one, two, three, four?

896
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:38,579
Damn it.

897
01:44:43,659 --> 01:44:44,699
This stream is boring.

898
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:56,970
Well, I'm sorry that you think that.

899
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:57,609
But it is.

900
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:02,340
This is not what I wanted to do tonight.

901
01:45:02,979 --> 01:45:04,180
I kind of got fucking screwed.

902
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:08,199
My Dreamcast overheated and exploded.

903
01:45:11,609 --> 01:45:13,930
And I wasn't able to play the Dreamcast thing that I wanted to do.

904
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:19,770
We're just relaxing.

905
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:24,899
I'll probably call it here in like an hour.

906
01:45:24,899 --> 01:45:29,510
What am I doing tomorrow?

907
01:45:30,069 --> 01:45:39,210
Tomorrow, I think I'm healthy enough to do VR again.

908
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:40,810
I'm pretty sure I'm good to go.

909
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:45,829
The last couple of days, I really wanted to just not do it.

910
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:51,529
I have like another four or five VR experiences I want to do.

911
01:45:51,529 --> 01:45:54,979
So expect Minecraft VR.

912
01:45:54,979 --> 01:45:56,260
Yes, it's going to happen.

913
01:45:56,819 --> 01:45:59,180
Minecraft VR is going to be tomorrow.

914
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:02,539
And probably a handful of other things.

915
01:46:02,539 --> 01:46:04,140
And I can't fucking believe.

916
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,579
Here's the worst part about that.

917
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:11,670
That stream will probably have the highest view count of any stream I've done in the last year.

918
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:14,390
Last time I played Minecraft for like an hour,

919
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:19,779
my view count went up by like a thousand to two thousand people.

920
01:46:19,779 --> 01:46:22,859
I don't know why, but it's okay.

921
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:23,420
It's all good.

922
01:46:24,539 --> 01:46:25,659
Over ten thousand?

923
01:46:25,659 --> 01:46:28,600
No, I don't think so.

924
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,840
I would be surprised if that stream had that many.

925
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:36,220
No way.

926
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,140
But that's what we're going to do tomorrow.

927
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:41,029
I'm definitely healthy enough again to do it.

928
01:46:41,029 --> 01:46:45,079
But for now, we're just chilling out.

929
01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:47,159
Just playing this little pick-ross game.

930
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:53,449
We're dialing it back a little.

931
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:55,930
And we'll get back to it tomorrow.

932
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:57,850
If you got somewhere to be, if you got somewhere to go,

933
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:00,970
or if you think it's boring, then we'll see tomorrow.

934
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:01,689
You know, it's okay.

935
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,659
Not every stream has to be fucking crazy.

936
01:47:05,659 --> 01:47:07,180
You know, sometimes you just paint a picture

937
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:10,380
and do it very slowly because you're bad.

938
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:17,140
But with that being said, let's go.

939
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:17,939
Let's just keep playing.

940
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:24,119
Whatever the music.

941
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:31,819
He's picking out all the one negative comments.

942
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:34,380
Yeah, but I want to be, let's be real about it.

943
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,699
I'm playing pick-ross.

944
01:47:38,939 --> 01:47:40,220
When I told everybody like,

945
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,300
Space Channel 5 tonight, guys.

946
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,020
Space Channel 5.

947
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:43,739
You already, oh yeah.

948
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:44,380
Choo, choo.

949
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:45,020
Can't wait.

950
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:50,359
That makes sense.

951
01:47:50,359 --> 01:47:53,659
So this is one, one, yeah.

952
01:47:53,659 --> 01:48:03,340
This is the two.

953
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,220
Also one, also one.

954
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:19,050
But yeah, VR will be tomorrow.

955
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:32,710
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

956
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:33,270
It's not enough.

957
01:48:34,949 --> 01:48:36,069
Is there a derma discord?

958
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:37,109
There is.

959
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:38,600
It's open to the public.

960
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:41,000
There are a couple of sub-only.

961
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Well, there's only one sub-only room, actually.

962
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,020
I can't make it tomorrow.

963
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:53,739
Will you cancel it?

964
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:54,800
No.

965
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:58,069
It's not going to be a long stream.

966
01:48:58,069 --> 01:49:00,149
All my VR streams are less than four or five hours.

967
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:04,859
So it's okay.

968
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:05,819
You go, you can, you catch it.

969
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:10,069
It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

970
01:49:10,069 --> 01:49:12,149
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

971
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:18,810
Now we got some info.

972
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,520
Mike, no.

973
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,960
Okay, this is part of the three then.

974
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:32,949
Three.

975
01:49:33,909 --> 01:49:35,029
Which way?

976
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:38,729
Well, it's definitely not here.

977
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:42,890
Two, three, four, five.

978
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:44,489
One, two, three, four, five.

979
01:49:44,489 --> 01:49:44,989
No.

980
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:48,699
To the stream again tomorrow, another day.

981
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,039
Just put aside five hours.

982
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:55,680
Yeah, and I can't, I can't expect everybody to make every stream.

983
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:06,489
What kind of psycho would I have to be to assume that everybody is going to be at the stream

984
01:50:07,789 --> 01:50:11,949
for five, four, five, six, seven plus hours?

985
01:50:11,949 --> 01:50:14,920
You know, people have shit to do.

986
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:18,760
Got, you know, some people got places to be, things to do.

987
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:21,739
That's a lot.

988
01:50:21,739 --> 01:50:24,220
Like, there's a commitment to sit here for, you know, eight hours.

989
01:50:25,529 --> 01:50:28,090
Some of you, like a lot of you guys stick around for a long time.

990
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:37,119
So this is the one then.

991
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:43,260
However long you stay, that's, I'm fucking happy you came.

992
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:54,140
Okay, two, there's three.

993
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,680
All right, getting somewhere.

994
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,229
Three, cover that.

995
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:12,060
So let's see what happens here.

996
01:51:19,949 --> 01:51:20,510
One, two.

997
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:24,039
No, I just, I don't know that info yet.

998
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:30,220
Where bots were not actually here.

999
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:36,300
Oh yeah, I see 2,800 unique IPs.

1000
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:40,329
That's not true.

1001
01:51:40,329 --> 01:51:41,369
I don't have that information.

1002
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,010
One, two, three.

1003
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:53,609
One, two, three, sit one, two.

1004
01:51:53,609 --> 01:51:54,569
All right, let's go right there.

1005
01:51:55,449 --> 01:51:59,199
Doesn't really help that much.

1006
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,199
No, not really.

1007
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:07,369
We're special bots, so we get our own IPs.

1008
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:13,039
Are you pulling, are you pulling my leg here?

1009
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,560
I think you might be.

1010
01:52:15,949 --> 01:52:21,119
God, some of you guys just tell tall tales.

1011
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:25,520
One, two, there's four.

1012
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,720
So one, two, three, four.

1013
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,000
No, this might be that one.

1014
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:37,640
We're either here or we're here.

1015
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:38,920
No way to tell.

1016
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:48,939
Shit, a lot of ones.

1017
01:53:01,239 --> 01:53:03,239
Modest Narcissist, 10 community subs.

1018
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:07,340
Thanks a lot.

1019
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:10,539
10 more community subs on top of all the other ones.

1020
01:53:10,539 --> 01:53:11,899
And all the fucking money.

1021
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:16,319
Thank you.

1022
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:20,380
I'm kind of stuck here.

1023
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:21,659
One of these I know can be filled in.

1024
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:24,989
One, two, three, four, five.

1025
01:53:24,989 --> 01:53:26,829
One, two, three.

1026
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:31,130
It's probably there, but it could be here too.

1027
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:44,140
Okay, I just got it.

1028
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:44,539
I got it.

1029
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,000
All right, I just had to look at it first.

1030
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,560
Okay, good, good, good.

1031
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,520
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1032
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:52,409
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1033
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:54,329
Block that out and go.

1034
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:56,010
Good, get rid of this.

1035
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:57,289
There's the two, there's the six.

1036
01:53:58,670 --> 01:53:59,470
One, two.

1037
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,840
Oh, it's just wonderful.

1038
01:54:04,489 --> 01:54:05,210
That one's done.

1039
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,609
Two, three.

1040
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:11,850
All you need, it's cascades once you get one.

1041
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:14,090
Once you fill in, you see it, your mind locks in.

1042
01:54:14,649 --> 01:54:16,170
And then bingo, the whole thing gets filled in.

1043
01:54:16,729 --> 01:54:18,939
That's two leaves us one.

1044
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:19,979
One more.

1045
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:22,399
It's probably up here.

1046
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:26,539
There's one, two, three, four, five.

1047
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,000
There's another one.

1048
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,479
All ones across the board.

1049
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:33,680
Now let's see here.

1050
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:34,479
This is a three.

1051
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,479
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1052
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,039
He blew it.

1053
01:54:50,779 --> 01:54:51,260
He blew it.

1054
01:54:51,899 --> 01:54:53,630
You had it and you blew it.

1055
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,859
Because look now, this is only, I blew it.

1056
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:11,720
Look, this is not part of the three.

1057
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,399
It's one, one, three, two.

1058
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:27,159
Shit.

1059
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:29,659
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1060
01:55:32,569 --> 01:55:33,770
No, this is the one that was given.

1061
01:55:35,289 --> 01:55:36,729
So this, this has to be here.

1062
01:55:37,369 --> 01:55:48,800
Let me just keep troubleshooting this.

1063
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,619
Because that's done.

1064
01:55:52,619 --> 01:55:53,260
This is done.

1065
01:55:53,979 --> 01:56:06,800
Let me see here.

1066
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,279
Guess snail.

1067
01:56:25,819 --> 01:56:32,909
It's, yeah, it's definitely a snail.

1068
01:56:32,909 --> 01:56:45,390
Let me see if I can just draw the picture now.

1069
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:45,949
It's here.

1070
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:48,279
Okay.

1071
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:50,619
One, two.

1072
01:56:51,770 --> 01:56:52,250
I'll get it.

1073
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:36,989
No, no.

1074
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:41,359
What happened here?

1075
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:42,399
Where's the one here?

1076
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:44,399
Here?

1077
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:45,039
It's done.

1078
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:45,920
It's so close.

1079
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:46,960
Which is incorrect.

1080
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,680
Here?

1081
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:57,720
Fuck.

1082
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,199
One, two, one.

1083
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:05,720
No, this is not right.

1084
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:29,579
Oh, one, one, I'm not seeing one thing.

1085
01:59:04,909 --> 01:59:06,109
I screwed it up.

1086
01:59:06,109 --> 01:59:07,069
I can't.

1087
01:59:07,069 --> 01:59:07,630
You do it.

1088
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,590
You guys do it.

1089
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,470
You guys do it.

1090
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:10,729
You do it.

1091
01:59:10,729 --> 01:59:11,210
You do it.

1092
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:12,729
I'm too fucked up right now.

1093
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:13,529
You do it.

1094
01:59:13,529 --> 01:59:16,510
I just do it.

1095
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:16,989
Just do it.

1096
01:59:16,989 --> 01:59:17,710
Somebody do it.

1097
01:59:18,270 --> 01:59:18,829
Somebody do it.

1098
01:59:18,829 --> 01:59:19,949
I'm going to close all these out.

1099
01:59:19,949 --> 01:59:20,590
Somebody do it.

1100
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,180
You're not going to fill A.

1101
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:25,659
No, no.

1102
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:26,539
Somebody do it.

1103
01:59:26,539 --> 01:59:27,260
Somebody get it.

1104
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:28,380
I'll, somebody do it.

1105
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:38,640
Clear G5.

1106
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,119
You got it.

1107
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:45,390
I'm just done.

1108
01:59:46,649 --> 01:59:48,970
My brain is fucking scrambled toast.

1109
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:51,789
And fill in G4.

1110
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:53,130
Okay.

1111
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,020
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1112
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,340
I'm not picking that one.

1113
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:04,750
G5, L4.

1114
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:06,029
Okay.

1115
02:00:06,029 --> 02:00:07,390
Looking good so far.

1116
02:00:07,949 --> 02:00:10,750
You guys are fucking bailing me out here.

1117
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,149
Thank you.

1118
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,840
Remove L4.

1119
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:16,239
It's gone.

1120
02:00:21,279 --> 02:00:22,079
It's working.

1121
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:22,880
It's working.

1122
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,359
And fill in L6.

1123
02:00:26,359 --> 02:00:27,880
Oh, thank goodness, you guys.

1124
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,279
Thank you.

1125
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:44,300
Well, congratulations, whoever guessed snail.

1126
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:45,659
I'm telling you, it's music.

1127
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:49,449
You guys wonder, why does he not have a playlist on?

1128
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:52,909
I can't, I can't focus on anything going on.

1129
02:00:53,710 --> 02:00:58,239
Why does he not listen to music?

1130
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:58,720
I can't.

1131
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:02,010
Unless I'm like locked in a room.

1132
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:07,119
This is one, two, three.

1133
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:07,760
Any zeros?

1134
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:14,329
Let's see.

1135
02:01:14,329 --> 02:01:17,689
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

1136
02:01:17,689 --> 02:01:19,050
No, it's not quite correct.

1137
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:30,279
All right, this is music.

1138
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:37,640
Okay, so one, two, three.

1139
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,600
One, two, three.

1140
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,039
The rest of this is garbage.

1141
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,819
Get rid of it.

1142
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:49,159
Can you put on my mixtape?

1143
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:50,960
Maybe.

1144
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,319
Depends on what it is.

1145
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,399
This is one, one, two.

1146
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:54,880
Let's see.

1147
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,760
So we got two, one, one, one.

1148
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,880
Two, one, one, one.

1149
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:01,930
One, two.

1150
02:02:02,489 --> 02:02:06,939
Put on the rat's mixtape.

1151
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:11,600
Well, there's five.

1152
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,399
Let's see.

1153
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:15,119
One, two, three, four, five, one.

1154
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:16,720
Okay, so divide all this.

1155
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,439
What the hell else do we have here?

1156
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:21,840
Three.

1157
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,520
Got to be here.

1158
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:25,239
There's your seven.

1159
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:28,539
Lightning on the gentleman.

1160
02:02:30,779 --> 02:02:31,500
Lots of ones.

1161
02:02:33,239 --> 02:02:33,960
There's the three.

1162
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,079
Fill this rest of it in.

1163
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:36,939
This is gone now, too.

1164
02:02:37,819 --> 02:02:39,260
So is this, and so is this.

1165
02:02:39,979 --> 02:02:41,850
And just that one up.

1166
02:02:41,850 --> 02:02:42,649
Cover that here.

1167
02:02:43,609 --> 02:02:47,739
What happened to Jerma's audio software stream?

1168
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,880
Yeah, I know.

1169
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,199
Too many ideas.

1170
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,489
They're all gonna happen.

1171
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:59,550
Did you see the Jerma is a liar video?

1172
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:01,439
I did.

1173
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:10,489
Play it again.

1174
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:19,159
One.

1175
02:03:19,159 --> 02:03:23,659
This is two, one.

1176
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:26,909
Filled in.

1177
02:03:26,909 --> 02:03:27,789
What is this music?

1178
02:03:27,789 --> 02:03:32,140
Is this a boomerang?

1179
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:36,460
One, two, three, four, five.

1180
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:43,960
Two.

1181
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,159
Cool.

1182
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,159
That's the rest of the eleven.

1183
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,479
One, one, one, three.

1184
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:01,949
That is a three here, too.

1185
02:04:01,949 --> 02:04:04,109
One, two, three, one, two, three.

1186
02:04:04,109 --> 02:04:11,020
We got four.

1187
02:04:11,659 --> 02:04:12,380
And then a one.

1188
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,619
We got one, three.

1189
02:04:14,619 --> 02:04:17,289
Where's that four at?

1190
02:04:17,289 --> 02:04:17,850
Right there.

1191
02:04:18,489 --> 02:04:20,079
And then right here.

1192
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:20,880
What is it?

1193
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:21,199
Comb?

1194
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:26,960
Oh, music, right.

1195
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,159
It's a pan flute.

1196
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,319
Hey, nice job, guys.

1197
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:38,300
Hey, Jerma, thanks for these streams.

1198
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:40,220
I can get through horror games more easily.

1199
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:42,409
Yeah.

1200
02:04:42,409 --> 02:04:43,210
Hell yeah.

1201
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:46,010
Don't get too scared.

1202
02:04:46,010 --> 02:04:47,369
Remember, it's not real.

1203
02:04:47,369 --> 02:05:08,479
Okay.

1204
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:09,439
Got seven.

1205
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:13,279
This is four.

1206
02:05:15,579 --> 02:05:16,220
Seven.

1207
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:18,699
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1208
02:05:18,699 --> 02:05:20,619
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1209
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,800
Can't do anything else.

1210
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:27,319
This is gonna be hard.

1211
02:05:28,039 --> 02:05:30,119
I really appreciate these quiet streams

1212
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:32,279
since I can be the one guy more often.

1213
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:32,520
Yeah.

1214
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:37,960
Don't worry.

1215
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,880
Tomorrow is very, very...

1216
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:43,529
It's rared up to be really loud and tense.

1217
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:47,369
There'll be a loud one tomorrow.

1218
02:05:47,369 --> 02:05:47,850
You'll see.

1219
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:55,100
So one.

1220
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:59,789
Let's go with one, two, three, four, five.

1221
02:05:59,789 --> 02:06:01,550
One, two, three, four, five.

1222
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:08,170
So now we can figure this out, right?

1223
02:06:08,729 --> 02:06:10,510
Because it can't be up there.

1224
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:12,430
So it's gonna be one, two, three, four, five.

1225
02:06:12,989 --> 02:06:14,800
One, two, three, four, five.

1226
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:20,250
One, two, three, four, space, two.

1227
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:22,010
And got it.

1228
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:29,369
No, I don't.

1229
02:06:29,449 --> 02:06:30,010
I don't know.

1230
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,140
That's wrong.

1231
02:06:34,279 --> 02:06:35,079
What can I do with this?

1232
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:37,479
Seven, two.

1233
02:06:41,710 --> 02:06:43,310
Well, there's a four here somewhere,

1234
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:45,229
but I don't know where because I don't have any more blocks.

1235
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:49,789
None of these can be figured out.

1236
02:06:49,789 --> 02:06:50,590
It's too little of them.

1237
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:53,739
Dermabate.

1238
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:59,149
I'm making you mental by not using the middle mouse button.

1239
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:01,340
Yeah, I know.

1240
02:07:01,899 --> 02:07:04,939
It's just different play styles, you know?

1241
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:26,140
Three, four, one, two.

1242
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,579
So that has to be there.

1243
02:07:27,579 --> 02:07:28,300
There's the five.

1244
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,359
Five can only be down, yeah?

1245
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,319
Yep.

1246
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,439
Now that hell unlocks this,

1247
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:47,630
which in turn lets us determine that you got one, two, three, four.

1248
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:49,869
Yes, I can do one, two, three, four.

1249
02:07:49,869 --> 02:07:55,720
Therefore, what about this one?

1250
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:56,359
Three.

1251
02:07:56,359 --> 02:07:57,960
You can do one, two, three.

1252
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,000
One, two, three, there.

1253
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,500
Four.

1254
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:02,159
Closing in on this one.

1255
02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:02,560
Let's see.

1256
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:12,090
Still trying to...

1257
02:08:12,090 --> 02:08:13,369
This is four, two.

1258
02:08:16,279 --> 02:08:17,239
Just which way does this...

1259
02:08:17,239 --> 02:08:19,560
Because if this is here, right?

1260
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,550
Say that's one, two, three, four.

1261
02:08:22,699 --> 02:08:24,380
Then it has to be either here.

1262
02:08:25,659 --> 02:08:26,159
No.

1263
02:08:26,859 --> 02:08:27,579
No.

1264
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:30,829
But if it's here, then it has to be here.

1265
02:08:30,829 --> 02:08:32,270
So I don't have enough info.

1266
02:08:42,939 --> 02:08:44,460
Dermabate wants to play RuneScape?

1267
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,479
I mean, I've never played it.

1268
02:08:53,119 --> 02:09:00,250
I can do something with this knowing that the six is down here though.

1269
02:09:00,890 --> 02:09:02,640
Let's see.

1270
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:06,680
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1271
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,220
So knowing that...

1272
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:12,300
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1273
02:09:12,859 --> 02:09:14,939
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1274
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:17,529
All right.

1275
02:09:17,529 --> 02:09:18,329
What does that lead us?

1276
02:09:24,199 --> 02:09:26,600
So that gives a few...

1277
02:09:28,039 --> 02:09:35,569
Bingo.

1278
02:09:36,109 --> 02:09:41,239
And all you got to do is unlock one.

1279
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:49,369
The whole thing starts to complete itself.

1280
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:56,090
Now this can go down.

1281
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:56,329
All right.

1282
02:09:56,329 --> 02:09:58,250
Let's go one, two, three, four.

1283
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:59,920
Or one, two, three, four.

1284
02:10:02,810 --> 02:10:07,319
So not enough info.

1285
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:08,439
Yes, there is.

1286
02:10:08,439 --> 02:10:11,369
Because of that new line I just made.

1287
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:14,399
Oh, that's some good cider, yeah?

1288
02:10:15,119 --> 02:10:17,439
I wish I had a cider right now.

1289
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,520
I'd just be hanging out, sipping it.

1290
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:23,369
So let's see.

1291
02:10:23,369 --> 02:10:24,489
That's done.

1292
02:10:24,489 --> 02:10:30,520
There's no way to know that.

1293
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,159
Well, there's no way it's there.

1294
02:10:33,159 --> 02:10:35,079
So one, two, three, one, two, three.

1295
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:35,800
Not enough info.

1296
02:10:41,229 --> 02:10:44,189
I mean, it really wants to be right here, doesn't it?

1297
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:07,149
Five, two, and this is one.

1298
02:11:07,149 --> 02:11:08,829
One, two, three, cross that.

1299
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:13,300
Okay.

1300
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:17,800
Too much info on the screen for me.

1301
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,800
Even though it's more desirable, I know.

1302
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:35,560
Was this an accessory?

1303
02:11:36,199 --> 02:11:40,270
What kind of accessory is this?

1304
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,239
So it's not here.

1305
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:45,840
It's none of these.

1306
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:46,720
It's not this one either.

1307
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,210
Good to know.

1308
02:11:54,569 --> 02:11:55,609
It's Shito.

1309
02:11:58,270 --> 02:12:00,460
It is Shito.

1310
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:01,659
I wonder if it's going to be yellow.

1311
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:18,189
Shito.

1312
02:12:18,189 --> 02:12:19,310
No, it is a pipe.

1313
02:12:20,029 --> 02:12:23,239
Did we already do this one?

1314
02:12:23,239 --> 02:12:27,050
I feel like we did that one already last time.

1315
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:28,829
Maybe not.

1316
02:12:28,829 --> 02:12:30,920
Hold on.

1317
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:31,479
Let me take a look.

1318
02:12:34,399 --> 02:12:36,239
Yeah, we did do that one last time.

1319
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:36,960
I was wondering.

1320
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,920
See, look, we did it.

1321
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:41,439
Remember mustache, watermelon.

1322
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:42,479
This is where we left off.

1323
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:46,319
This is tools.

1324
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:47,760
Also 15 by 15.

1325
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:51,640
This one looks interesting.

1326
02:12:52,199 --> 02:13:02,079
13, 14, 5, 8, 15.

1327
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:03,359
So we can do this row.

1328
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:10,840
So it's a tool.

1329
02:13:11,479 --> 02:13:15,560
And there are no zeros this time.

1330
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:16,060
No.

1331
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:17,720
No help this time.

1332
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:24,430
13, did that.

1333
02:13:24,989 --> 02:13:28,350
All right.

1334
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,710
Any more that I guarantee?

1335
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:30,109
Let's see.

1336
02:13:30,109 --> 02:13:33,210
That's 3, 6, 12, 13, 14.

1337
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:33,710
No.

1338
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:44,350
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

1339
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1340
02:13:56,489 --> 02:13:57,130
Not quite.

1341
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:58,090
I need to get something else here.

1342
02:13:58,090 --> 02:13:58,729
Some more data.

1343
02:14:01,319 --> 02:14:03,159
But let's cancel this stuff out over here.

1344
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:09,210
So all these down here.

1345
02:14:11,449 --> 02:14:17,380
Okay.

1346
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:19,449
Again, same thing with this one.

1347
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:25,359
Any more?

1348
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:26,079
That's a 1.

1349
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:26,880
That's a 1.

1350
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,680
That's a 7.

1351
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:29,680
That's a...

1352
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,840
I can do this one now, can't I?

1353
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:34,720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1354
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:41,130
5, 1, 2, 3, 4.

1355
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:41,770
Nah, I can't.

1356
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,359
Guys, get some pretty good guesses so far.

1357
02:14:54,909 --> 02:14:55,390
Who knows?

1358
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:00,239
All right.

1359
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:01,680
7, 1, 1.

1360
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:07,310
Well, it has to be this way.

1361
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:09,229
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1362
02:15:09,229 --> 02:15:09,710
There it is.

1363
02:15:12,189 --> 02:15:13,550
Maybe give us some more info.

1364
02:15:16,939 --> 02:15:17,659
There's 2.

1365
02:15:17,659 --> 02:15:18,859
Cross this whole thing out.

1366
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:24,239
Is that 4?

1367
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,159
3.

1368
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:27,520
It's got to be here, right?

1369
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:32,970
Yeah, because 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1370
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:33,689
Yeah, that's it.

1371
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:35,609
Is that done?

1372
02:15:36,409 --> 02:15:37,130
Well, row gone.

1373
02:15:42,859 --> 02:15:43,579
13.

1374
02:15:43,579 --> 02:15:43,979
Close it.

1375
02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:44,539
14.

1376
02:15:44,539 --> 02:15:45,020
Close it.

1377
02:15:45,579 --> 02:15:45,979
Close it.

1378
02:15:47,609 --> 02:15:48,409
Nice.

1379
02:15:48,409 --> 02:15:49,130
There's the 5.

1380
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:56,039
This is a really weird looking tool.

1381
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:01,279
It's got an umbrella.

1382
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:04,380
This actually could be an umbrella, maybe.

1383
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:15,039
A fairly busted umbrella.

1384
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:36,489
Let's not do that yet.

1385
02:16:36,489 --> 02:16:46,729
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1386
02:16:49,659 --> 02:16:50,299
There we go.

1387
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,500
4 somewhere.

1388
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,620
1, 2, 3, 4.

1389
02:17:04,889 --> 02:17:05,450
1.

1390
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:06,090
Yep.

1391
02:17:06,090 --> 02:17:07,209
All right.

1392
02:17:07,209 --> 02:17:07,770
What are that?

1393
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:08,809
Any more info?

1394
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:17,049
What the hell is this tool?

1395
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:32,940
Looks like a wine opener.

1396
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:40,319
1, 4, right?

1397
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:42,000
I mean, it has to be.

1398
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1399
02:17:47,149 --> 02:17:47,549
Don't know.

1400
02:17:48,110 --> 02:17:49,559
Could be anything.

1401
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:53,950
5, 4, 1, 1.

1402
02:17:53,950 --> 02:17:54,750
There's your 1.

1403
02:17:55,549 --> 02:17:58,430
3, 1.

1404
02:17:59,229 --> 02:17:59,790
That's done.

1405
02:18:01,559 --> 02:18:02,600
Do I have this incorrect?

1406
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,799
This looks completely wrong.

1407
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:12,120
Doesn't this look completely incorrect?

1408
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:21,209
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1409
02:18:22,329 --> 02:18:31,709
2, 1 is the 2.

1410
02:18:35,149 --> 02:18:35,950
All right.

1411
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:36,510
Almost done.

1412
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:50,299
4 somewhere in here.

1413
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:52,909
3.

1414
02:18:52,909 --> 02:18:54,030
No, the 1 is there.

1415
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:56,110
This is the 2.

1416
02:18:56,829 --> 02:19:01,879
This is the end of that.

1417
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,409
8.

1418
02:19:10,409 --> 02:19:12,159
Done.

1419
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:12,959
3.

1420
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:19,739
So now I have to consider where the 6 is.

1421
02:19:19,739 --> 02:19:21,260
Because that's 3.

1422
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:22,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1423
02:19:23,899 --> 02:19:24,860
Space.

1424
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:25,659
1, 2, 3.

1425
02:19:25,659 --> 02:19:26,299
No, not quite.

1426
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:37,319
That's done.

1427
02:19:37,319 --> 02:19:38,750
That makes things a little easier.

1428
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:42,000
Because then, yeah.

1429
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:43,819
Cool.

1430
02:19:43,819 --> 02:19:52,569
Is this a hammer?

1431
02:19:53,049 --> 02:19:54,090
That's clearly a hammer.

1432
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:14,430
It's somebody holding a hammer.

1433
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:19,579
Well, nice job.

1434
02:20:19,579 --> 02:20:21,180
Got another easy one here.

1435
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:22,379
What time is it?

1436
02:20:22,379 --> 02:20:23,420
It's been about 5 hours.

1437
02:20:24,059 --> 02:20:26,250
I'll keep going.

1438
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:27,129
I'm good to go.

1439
02:20:27,129 --> 02:20:28,090
Probably like a little while.

1440
02:20:36,459 --> 02:20:37,340
I think this is done already.

1441
02:20:37,979 --> 02:20:40,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1442
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:41,420
I live it is.

1443
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:47,469
Play some music?

1444
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:50,030
I got one right now.

1445
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:52,809
I like this is very, very...

1446
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,489
It sits in the background.

1447
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,719
It's not causing any problems.

1448
02:20:59,579 --> 02:21:01,420
My two halves can sit together.

1449
02:21:02,059 --> 02:21:05,399
I like this for now.

1450
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:10,459
Yeah, it's pretty good coffee shop music.

1451
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:12,059
This is really good weather channel music.

1452
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,200
You know, while you sit there and watch

1453
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,559
to see if your school got canceled.

1454
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:24,159
Where are we?

1455
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:27,340
1, 5, 6, 7, no.

1456
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,040
But I can do this.

1457
02:21:32,489 --> 02:21:35,239
Because, I mean, if it's here,

1458
02:21:35,239 --> 02:21:36,360
let's just do that.

1459
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,879
Because then it has to be space.

1460
02:21:37,879 --> 02:21:39,799
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1461
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:42,959
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1462
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,700
Okay.

1463
02:21:49,049 --> 02:21:50,170
Dude, school got canceled?

1464
02:21:50,170 --> 02:21:50,809
Are you serious?

1465
02:21:51,610 --> 02:21:53,899
I used to love that.

1466
02:21:53,899 --> 02:21:54,860
It was the best thing ever.

1467
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:59,200
Nothing could compare to when you got up

1468
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,719
on a snow-filled day.

1469
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,479
Looked out the window.

1470
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:04,239
Saw that there was a shitload of snow outside

1471
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:05,680
and you're like, there's no way I'm going to school.

1472
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:11,149
Somebody tells you, no school.

1473
02:22:11,149 --> 02:22:12,909
And you go, I cannot wait.

1474
02:22:12,909 --> 02:22:14,110
That's perfect.

1475
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:15,469
Go outside for like 40 minutes.

1476
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:20,120
Come back in and play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

1477
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,799
Turtles in Time all day.

1478
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:26,120
What a day.

1479
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:30,000
That's zero, zero.

1480
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,250
This is also part of seven.

1481
02:22:34,889 --> 02:22:36,879
Well, wait a minute, hold on.

1482
02:22:36,879 --> 02:22:38,159
Can I just do this now?

1483
02:22:38,159 --> 02:22:39,690
No, not yet.

1484
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:43,340
This might be the three.

1485
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:48,459
This is the end of the four.

1486
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,379
So let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4.

1487
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:53,840
Right?

1488
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:56,350
1, 2, 3, 4.

1489
02:22:57,069 --> 02:23:07,200
Those days were awesome,

1490
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,319
but I'll never forget that day we were

1491
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:12,920
the only school in the valley that didn't have

1492
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,120
their school closed for weather.

1493
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:17,239
Yeah, that sucked.

1494
02:23:17,879 --> 02:23:24,430
When you were certain that school was going to get canceled

1495
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:25,309
and then no, it did not.

1496
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:26,030
You had to go to school.

1497
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:28,829
Or like a two hour delay, a one hour delay.

1498
02:23:29,469 --> 02:23:32,270
That was worse than just going to school

1499
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:35,200
because then that sinking feeling in your gut.

1500
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:38,299
Oh, there's a foot of snow on the ground.

1501
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,000
One hour delay.

1502
02:23:51,079 --> 02:23:54,040
I would rather than add an hour to the top of school

1503
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:57,000
than let me come in an hour late on a school day,

1504
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:57,639
on a snow day.

1505
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,319
That sucks.

1506
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:04,909
All right, let's focus here.

1507
02:24:04,909 --> 02:24:05,549
So this is the two.

1508
02:24:06,190 --> 02:24:13,870
I don't know if this is the one or the three.

1509
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:15,229
This is part of the seven.

1510
02:24:15,229 --> 02:24:15,709
So let's see.

1511
02:24:15,709 --> 02:24:16,909
I closed that down a little.

1512
02:24:16,909 --> 02:24:17,629
This could be the one.

1513
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:20,799
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1514
02:24:20,799 --> 02:24:22,719
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1515
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:24,799
Not much more info I can go on there though.

1516
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:29,559
This is the one.

1517
02:24:30,280 --> 02:24:31,399
And let's let's see how one.

1518
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:34,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1519
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:35,340
No.

1520
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:38,030
I don't know what to tell.

1521
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,530
Not yet.

1522
02:24:45,319 --> 02:24:51,340
2, 7, 2, 1.

1523
02:24:51,979 --> 02:24:52,379
Let's see.

1524
02:24:52,379 --> 02:24:59,120
1, 7, and 1 could be down here.

1525
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:05,209
Which means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1526
02:25:05,209 --> 02:25:07,770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1527
02:25:08,989 --> 02:25:09,489
Awesome.

1528
02:25:10,030 --> 02:25:14,729
Does that do anything for me?

1529
02:25:15,610 --> 02:25:16,729
I don't think it does.

1530
02:25:18,379 --> 02:25:19,500
Unless this is a one.

1531
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,299
No, it is.

1532
02:25:20,299 --> 02:25:21,340
So this is going to help here.

1533
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:28,159
Whenever we had a delay,

1534
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:31,120
my mom just called in to say it was too icy where we lived.

1535
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:35,610
Fucking that's a 300 IQ mom play right there.

1536
02:25:39,639 --> 02:25:39,959
All right.

1537
02:25:39,959 --> 02:25:42,040
So let's just say that this is the four here.

1538
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:45,739
So let's say that this is the one.

1539
02:25:45,739 --> 02:25:49,549
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

1540
02:25:49,549 --> 02:25:52,670
All right, nice.

1541
02:25:52,670 --> 02:25:55,879
It's clearly the four.

1542
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:02,219
For a 75 IQ kid?

1543
02:26:04,430 --> 02:26:05,709
How do you know that?

1544
02:26:05,709 --> 02:26:06,909
You don't have that information.

1545
02:26:06,909 --> 02:26:07,469
What do you mean?

1546
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:09,530
Was that you?

1547
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:10,889
Wait, who did you write?

1548
02:26:10,889 --> 02:26:12,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1549
02:26:12,649 --> 02:26:26,190
Did I just read maybe their best friends?

1550
02:26:27,709 --> 02:26:28,750
No, no.

1551
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:30,110
How would you know that if it wasn't?

1552
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:32,510
Did somebody somebody find that?

1553
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,790
I they're friends.

1554
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:39,639
Oh, you're right.

1555
02:26:39,639 --> 02:26:39,959
You're right.

1556
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:40,760
That could be possible.

1557
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:00,079
How did you not figure that out?

1558
02:27:01,799 --> 02:27:03,079
I don't know because who knows?

1559
02:27:05,159 --> 02:27:06,280
This is the three here.

1560
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:07,639
I figured that out.

1561
02:27:07,639 --> 02:27:08,760
So I was three.

1562
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:17,370
All right.

1563
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:18,809
This is an animal.

1564
02:27:18,809 --> 02:27:20,719
We're all friends.

1565
02:27:20,719 --> 02:27:22,159
We all have the same IQ.

1566
02:27:22,719 --> 02:27:36,239
I'm going to assume it's these two are both filled in.

1567
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,520
In that case, then it would be aye, aye, aye.

1568
02:27:40,799 --> 02:27:46,680
Hold on.

1569
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,879
This is five.

1570
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:53,000
So one, two, three, five.

1571
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,520
So that goes up this shit.

1572
02:27:55,479 --> 02:27:58,989
So then same thing with this.

1573
02:27:59,709 --> 02:28:15,370
Get rid of this nonsense, which in turn move those out of the way now.

1574
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:18,670
Fuck.

1575
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:28,409
There's another one over here.

1576
02:28:28,409 --> 02:28:29,690
Let's just say it's right there.

1577
02:28:30,889 --> 02:28:35,739
Combine our IQs together.

1578
02:28:37,209 --> 02:28:38,969
Me dumber since I start watching.

1579
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:44,520
You're probably smarter.

1580
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:45,959
You just feel dumber.

1581
02:28:45,959 --> 02:28:58,079
I think that helps here.

1582
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:10,360
Yes, progress has been made.

1583
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:11,000
I did it.

1584
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,280
I clicked one.

1585
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:22,590
Actually might be a rat.

1586
02:29:23,229 --> 02:29:26,479
So then the three is over here somewhere.

1587
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,319
Wait, that's down there.

1588
02:29:55,959 --> 02:29:58,329
Yeah, that's the only place that can be.

1589
02:29:58,969 --> 02:30:04,350
I mean, it could be here, but then that would be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1590
02:30:04,989 --> 02:30:05,709
No, I don't know.

1591
02:30:05,709 --> 02:30:07,069
I can't tell if that's down there or not.

1592
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:24,639
Fuck.

1593
02:30:28,139 --> 02:30:31,709
Well, this is obviously a two has to be back here.

1594
02:30:31,709 --> 02:30:32,590
So it's not this.

1595
02:30:33,149 --> 02:30:33,870
Oh, okay.

1596
02:30:33,870 --> 02:30:34,909
I just helped myself there.

1597
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,159
That helps.

1598
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:40,000
How much does that give me?

1599
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:46,120
Enough.

1600
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:51,079
Oh, perfect.

1601
02:30:51,079 --> 02:30:51,959
Okay, cool.

1602
02:30:51,959 --> 02:30:53,899
So this is seven now.

1603
02:30:53,899 --> 02:30:54,540
Fill that in.

1604
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:57,020
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1605
02:30:57,899 --> 02:30:59,319
One is somewhere over there.

1606
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:01,799
Ten is filled in.

1607
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:02,440
There you go.

1608
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:08,590
Five could be anywhere right now.

1609
02:31:22,809 --> 02:31:25,340
Seven, start on two, three.

1610
02:31:26,459 --> 02:31:31,020
Well, I just threw that one completely under the bus for everybody that thought this was a rat.

1611
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:36,879
It is absolutely not a rat.

1612
02:31:36,879 --> 02:31:38,879
It's very, it's a rat with a tall head.

1613
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,079
Looks incorrect.

1614
02:31:50,719 --> 02:32:02,299
No, I can stay.

1615
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:13,260
So, hey, look, perfect opportunity for a one.

1616
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,559
What the hell is this?

1617
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:20,489
Is this a bird?

1618
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:39,500
I have no idea.

1619
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:53,610
Well, let's just say, what the hell is that?

1620
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:56,239
Four is somewhere here.

1621
02:32:56,239 --> 02:32:57,120
I need to figure this out.

1622
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:05,520
Could be here though.

1623
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:05,920
It could.

1624
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:19,440
What?

1625
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:27,709
Why is this down here?

1626
02:33:29,739 --> 02:33:32,219
It shouldn't have a detached leg.

1627
02:33:43,719 --> 02:33:44,360
Is this poo?

1628
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:45,079
It's not poo.

1629
02:33:45,639 --> 02:33:49,959
Four, three.

1630
02:33:51,850 --> 02:33:52,889
This can be filled in.

1631
02:33:52,889 --> 02:33:53,530
No, it can't.

1632
02:33:54,090 --> 02:34:02,920
I think it has to, this one of these has to be here.

1633
02:34:03,479 --> 02:34:10,459
Because if, let's just say it's, if you got one, two, three, four, get a space,

1634
02:34:11,340 --> 02:34:16,079
which leads to one, two, three, or one, two, three.

1635
02:34:16,079 --> 02:34:17,200
It has to be there, I think.

1636
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:20,360
I'm not certain though.

1637
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,319
I'm going to keep that there.

1638
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:29,290
That's not right.

1639
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:43,520
What animal is this?

1640
02:34:46,729 --> 02:34:47,450
Yeah, I had it right.

1641
02:35:00,409 --> 02:35:01,290
I am stumped.

1642
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:03,770
I don't know what, what this could remotely could be.

1643
02:35:05,209 --> 02:35:06,170
Is this the head over here?

1644
02:35:06,170 --> 02:35:07,370
Or is this the head here?

1645
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:08,329
Or is the head down here?

1646
02:35:08,329 --> 02:35:09,209
Is it like curled up?

1647
02:35:13,159 --> 02:35:14,520
No, it is the two.

1648
02:35:15,159 --> 02:35:21,879
Okay, I still haven't figured that part out though.

1649
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:31,680
It's done.

1650
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:32,180
All right.

1651
02:35:43,309 --> 02:35:45,149
Is it a, it's probably a rooster probably.

1652
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:46,989
Kangaroo?

1653
02:35:46,989 --> 02:35:47,489
Maybe.

1654
02:35:48,049 --> 02:36:08,219
This one's tricky though, because I can't, I just kind of need to, what is it?

1655
02:36:11,329 --> 02:36:15,469
It's a seagull!

1656
02:36:15,469 --> 02:36:21,489
Wow, four people got that.

1657
02:36:21,489 --> 02:36:32,899
Nice job.

1658
02:36:32,899 --> 02:36:40,850
Stream has been saved.

1659
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:45,250
12, 13, 14, 15, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1660
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:51,090
Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

1661
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:57,090
Okay, same thing here.

1662
02:36:57,090 --> 02:37:03,680
11, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1663
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:16,979
Nobody saw that.

1664
02:37:20,670 --> 02:37:21,469
Zero IQ.

1665
02:37:22,819 --> 02:37:23,700
Nobody saw that.

1666
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:28,319
That's 11.

1667
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:32,670
So this is 12 down.

1668
02:37:32,670 --> 02:37:33,790
That's eight, nine, 10, 11.

1669
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:42,049
He's got a fucking beef brain.

1670
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:44,799
Well, that's the one.

1671
02:37:44,799 --> 02:37:45,299
Sure.

1672
02:37:46,129 --> 02:37:46,930
Let's continue down.

1673
02:37:47,969 --> 02:37:49,409
Six, three, seven.

1674
02:37:49,409 --> 02:37:50,770
Any more that I can do?

1675
02:37:51,489 --> 02:37:54,350
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

1676
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:55,069
It's not 12.

1677
02:37:55,709 --> 02:37:56,639
So close.

1678
02:38:04,879 --> 02:38:05,680
This is a toy.

1679
02:38:06,639 --> 02:38:10,059
Three, go like this.

1680
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:15,680
Let's see how much we can get here.

1681
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,520
And it's one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five.

1682
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:24,819
Okay, anything else?

1683
02:38:24,819 --> 02:38:25,860
That's the one.

1684
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:27,139
No, no more info there.

1685
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:29,059
Six, we can do some of this.

1686
02:38:33,870 --> 02:38:35,790
Three, again, we can go like this.

1687
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:39,540
Two is even better.

1688
02:38:44,989 --> 02:38:49,090
Seven, three, four, five, six, seven.

1689
02:38:51,659 --> 02:38:54,059
Okay, let's get to work.

1690
02:38:54,780 --> 02:39:11,469
Back to be two, one.

1691
02:39:16,510 --> 02:39:17,229
Rufor is wrong.

1692
02:39:17,950 --> 02:39:18,989
What do you mean?

1693
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:25,920
Oh, I thought for some reason I thought it was the only the...

1694
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:26,799
Yeah, I'm stupid.

1695
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:30,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1696
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:30,989
That's true, that's true, that's true.

1697
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,600
Because look, there has to be a two in here.

1698
02:39:34,739 --> 02:39:35,860
Yeah, no, that's correct.

1699
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:36,500
I had it right.

1700
02:39:37,059 --> 02:39:37,780
Just not this one.

1701
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:47,680
The eight and the two.

1702
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:48,159
What do you mean?

1703
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:51,680
Other Xs.

1704
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:52,479
This is row four.

1705
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:55,899
This is the one here.

1706
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:02,559
I mean, I guess technically you're right.

1707
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:05,600
This could be the three, right?

1708
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,200
Technically that you could be right.

1709
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:11,309
No, I'll leave it.

1710
02:40:11,870 --> 02:40:19,709
All right, let's get started.

1711
02:40:20,270 --> 02:40:23,920
No two there.

1712
02:40:26,290 --> 02:40:28,209
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1713
02:40:28,209 --> 02:40:31,489
Three, six, three, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1714
02:40:40,909 --> 02:40:41,709
Four is to work with.

1715
02:40:47,819 --> 02:40:48,459
There's the two.

1716
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:52,930
There's a two in here somewhere.

1717
02:40:52,930 --> 02:40:53,729
There's the 11.

1718
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:04,219
Two and then two.

1719
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:06,139
I'll take a look at that.

1720
02:41:06,860 --> 02:41:07,500
Found them.

1721
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:08,219
Found that two.

1722
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:11,700
And then seven, nice.

1723
02:41:12,579 --> 02:41:15,649
Which then leads us to two.

1724
02:41:15,649 --> 02:41:16,930
Cover, cover, cover, cover.

1725
02:41:17,809 --> 02:41:21,069
Now this is great because look at this.

1726
02:41:21,709 --> 02:41:23,500
Say goodbye to everything up here.

1727
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:24,219
Everything up here.

1728
02:41:24,219 --> 02:41:24,940
Everything up here.

1729
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:26,379
Not quite up here.

1730
02:41:29,309 --> 02:41:29,950
It's just row.

1731
02:41:36,129 --> 02:41:36,850
This game does not.

1732
02:41:36,850 --> 02:41:38,129
I don't think this game has an OST.

1733
02:41:38,129 --> 02:41:39,010
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

1734
02:41:40,879 --> 02:41:43,760
It just has one song that plays some way over and over again.

1735
02:41:47,010 --> 02:41:54,579
All right, so this is definitely one, two, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1736
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:57,340
This is part of the three.

1737
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:04,500
Five, one, one, two.

1738
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:05,379
No, I can do this now.

1739
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:13,709
Five, two, two, three, six, nice.

1740
02:42:18,059 --> 02:42:22,559
Three, four, gone.

1741
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:27,709
This could go either way for a little while.

1742
02:42:28,909 --> 02:42:31,629
There's two.

1743
02:42:31,629 --> 02:42:33,229
So then one, two, three.

1744
02:42:33,229 --> 02:42:34,430
Got to be right in the middle there.

1745
02:42:34,430 --> 02:42:35,629
And it has to be right there.

1746
02:42:35,629 --> 02:42:36,030
Thank you.

1747
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:42,610
Eight, you got to connect these.

1748
02:42:43,569 --> 02:42:45,579
Fill in the three.

1749
02:42:46,299 --> 02:42:54,450
Where does that lead?

1750
02:42:55,010 --> 02:43:00,719
That's two, one, two, three, one, two, three.

1751
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:05,549
I wish I had this one earlier.

1752
02:43:09,899 --> 02:43:12,459
Six, one, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1753
02:43:16,209 --> 02:43:17,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1754
02:43:17,809 --> 02:43:23,549
That leads to one, two, three, four, five.

1755
02:43:24,350 --> 02:43:26,340
This is a toy.

1756
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:27,379
I know what this is.

1757
02:43:27,379 --> 02:43:38,420
All right, this should be fairly self-explanatory now.

1758
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:47,790
And then the four, and then the eight.

1759
02:43:49,809 --> 02:43:50,530
Rubber Duckie.

1760
02:43:52,239 --> 02:43:54,239
Congratulations to those of you that guessed it correct.

1761
02:43:57,329 --> 02:43:58,610
One, two, three, four, five.

1762
02:43:58,610 --> 02:43:59,489
A lot of you guys said boat.

1763
02:44:02,299 --> 02:44:04,940
Yeah, it looked a lot like a boat when we first started it.

1764
02:44:06,239 --> 02:44:06,959
Bath Duck.

1765
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:10,860
Nobody says bath duck.

1766
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:19,090
Bath Duck sounds like a Russian translation.

1767
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:22,299
It's bath duck.

1768
02:44:22,299 --> 02:44:26,420
Let's see.

1769
02:44:26,979 --> 02:44:32,530
So this is 15 by 15, but it's actually not.

1770
02:44:36,219 --> 02:44:42,989
That's 14 across not quite what we're looking for.

1771
02:44:42,989 --> 02:44:47,950
I'll find a good one here.

1772
02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:51,440
I can still do it though.

1773
02:44:51,440 --> 02:44:53,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1774
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,219
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1775
02:44:57,940 --> 02:45:01,700
So let's just assume that this is in the middle.

1776
02:45:03,059 --> 02:45:05,059
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1777
02:45:05,059 --> 02:45:05,700
I can do these.

1778
02:45:06,739 --> 02:45:13,149
And then over here, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1779
02:45:14,030 --> 02:45:18,430
So that's one, two, three, four, five, six.

1780
02:45:18,989 --> 02:45:20,590
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1781
02:45:21,309 --> 02:45:22,510
I can get that done at least.

1782
02:45:35,409 --> 02:45:36,129
Is that far enough?

1783
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:38,879
It is.

1784
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,690
There's our six.

1785
02:45:41,329 --> 02:45:46,530
This is a food.

1786
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,159
Food.

1787
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:58,620
Knowing that, that's all I know at the moment.

1788
02:45:58,620 --> 02:45:59,979
Except this could be the...

1789
02:45:59,979 --> 02:46:01,659
This might be the two or the four.

1790
02:46:01,659 --> 02:46:02,540
Could it be the four?

1791
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:03,819
One, two, three, four.

1792
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:05,180
Space.

1793
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:11,180
Not the four.

1794
02:46:11,180 --> 02:46:11,899
This has to be the four.

1795
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:22,590
Which leads...

1796
02:46:22,590 --> 02:46:25,620
That's seven, five, two, two.

1797
02:46:26,659 --> 02:46:29,489
Let's see.

1798
02:46:30,209 --> 02:46:35,120
Two.

1799
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:44,049
Well, let's do this.

1800
02:46:44,049 --> 02:46:46,370
Let's narrow it down because I can do some of this.

1801
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:55,920
Wish I had something over here.

1802
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:58,479
Seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1803
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,760
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1804
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:05,229
I can at least get it kind of narrowed.

1805
02:47:09,250 --> 02:47:11,170
This is the janitor game from yesterday.

1806
02:47:11,729 --> 02:47:15,469
I know this is a little more involved than the janitor game.

1807
02:47:15,469 --> 02:47:16,110
I will say.

1808
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:19,360
Shit.

1809
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:31,629
I got this one, yeah.

1810
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:41,139
Yeah, no five.

1811
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:43,260
This is five, four.

1812
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:44,459
So five, it has to be here.

1813
02:47:45,340 --> 02:47:47,280
So do I have enough?

1814
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:49,120
One, two, three, four, five.

1815
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:51,120
One, two, three, four.

1816
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:52,590
Nope.

1817
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:54,110
That's enough info to get the middle, though.

1818
02:47:54,750 --> 02:48:00,610
Because again, let's assume that it looks like this.

1819
02:48:01,409 --> 02:48:05,299
And just go like that.

1820
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,379
And then go like this, right?

1821
02:48:07,379 --> 02:48:08,420
One, two, three, four.

1822
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:09,620
One, two, three, four.

1823
02:48:09,620 --> 02:48:11,139
One, two, three, four, five.

1824
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:12,989
One, two, three.

1825
02:48:12,989 --> 02:48:16,479
I mean, I'm just going to assume this.

1826
02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:22,879
Now this is interesting because this makes this the one.

1827
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,920
Same thing over here, right?

1828
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:26,639
No.

1829
02:48:26,639 --> 02:48:28,059
This makes this the three.

1830
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:41,440
If that's the case, that would make this the six.

1831
02:48:42,079 --> 02:48:44,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1832
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,200
Yeah, I would make this the six.

1833
02:48:46,159 --> 02:48:48,770
Whoops, and this is a two.

1834
02:48:49,489 --> 02:48:59,940
Let's see.

1835
02:49:00,739 --> 02:49:05,870
Three, four, five.

1836
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:20,350
This is an outside source from music.

1837
02:49:20,350 --> 02:49:21,629
It's not from the game itself.

1838
02:49:22,430 --> 02:49:28,770
Why is everybody doing the oh my god face?

1839
02:49:32,989 --> 02:49:35,149
I'm seeing a lot of oh my oh no face.

1840
02:49:35,950 --> 02:49:36,909
Why, what's happening?

1841
02:49:36,909 --> 02:49:44,020
What's wrong?

1842
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:45,139
Whoa, that like blinked.

1843
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:52,049
This has to be five in a row.

1844
02:49:55,940 --> 02:49:56,899
Narrowing this down.

1845
02:49:56,899 --> 02:49:58,020
Can I even get one here?

1846
02:50:02,110 --> 02:50:02,590
Nice, okay.

1847
02:50:02,590 --> 02:50:03,389
At least I can get that.

1848
02:50:04,110 --> 02:50:06,829
So these are all two, two, two.

1849
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:10,270
Again, we got, it could be here, here, here, here.

1850
02:50:10,989 --> 02:50:14,850
That means that this is empty, right?

1851
02:50:14,850 --> 02:50:16,819
It has to be, at least.

1852
02:50:17,379 --> 02:50:30,350
And then this is two, four, two, one, two, three, four.

1853
02:50:30,350 --> 02:50:30,989
Still possible.

1854
02:50:31,629 --> 02:50:36,209
Can we leave the border's bookstore, dad?

1855
02:50:37,229 --> 02:50:38,750
No, I can do this shit for free.

1856
02:50:39,309 --> 02:50:43,579
I just have to pretend I'm reading books and pretend I'm browsing.

1857
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:07,659
Two, three, four, five, three, four, five.

1858
02:51:12,770 --> 02:51:13,889
Ooh, I think we got it.

1859
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:15,969
That's how you narrow it down.

1860
02:51:17,620 --> 02:51:28,209
Yes, okay.

1861
02:51:29,010 --> 02:51:34,049
So then now we got two.

1862
02:51:35,170 --> 02:51:36,209
Still got nothing over here.

1863
02:51:36,770 --> 02:51:50,819
Let me just get this out of the way because this is two now.

1864
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:53,649
So it has to be here, here.

1865
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:56,209
That one is not correct there.

1866
02:51:56,930 --> 02:52:00,239
One, two, one.

1867
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:04,079
Again, that can be closed.

1868
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:08,020
There's your two right there.

1869
02:52:09,469 --> 02:52:10,750
But is it?

1870
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:13,659
I know that's correct.

1871
02:52:14,379 --> 02:52:17,409
But is this also a two here?

1872
02:52:18,049 --> 02:52:18,549
Yeah.

1873
02:52:19,739 --> 02:52:21,659
Uh, yeah.

1874
02:52:22,379 --> 02:52:36,379
All right, slow it down here.

1875
02:52:36,379 --> 02:52:39,680
And that's one, two, fuck.

1876
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:41,920
One, two, three, four, fuck.

1877
02:52:50,299 --> 02:52:53,659
No, what did I do wrong here?

1878
02:52:53,659 --> 02:52:54,700
What did I assume there?

1879
02:52:55,420 --> 02:53:00,079
Because that's one, two, three.

1880
02:53:00,079 --> 02:53:01,840
This was, this was here the whole time.

1881
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:02,639
This is new here.

1882
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:06,100
The one and three.

1883
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:16,579
But that, uh, where did this go wrong?

1884
02:53:16,579 --> 02:53:17,379
I don't want to reset this.

1885
02:53:17,379 --> 02:53:18,739
I feel like just one block is wrong.

1886
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:32,690
Three, two, move this.

1887
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:33,409
Hold on.

1888
02:53:33,409 --> 02:53:41,219
One, one.

1889
02:53:41,219 --> 02:53:44,829
No, this, this is, this is the wrong, this row is wrong.

1890
02:53:45,709 --> 02:53:46,670
Something's fucked up here.

1891
02:53:47,940 --> 02:53:50,500
Because two and then five, how did this come up?

1892
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:52,959
This is the correct part.

1893
02:53:53,600 --> 02:54:09,680
Yeah, this is fucked up.

1894
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:14,559
Damn it, I'm gonna have to restart it.

1895
02:54:14,559 --> 02:54:16,879
Oh, it's the worst part when you play Picross.

1896
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:21,040
You jumble up one thing and then you can't,

1897
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:22,639
your brain has already done it.

1898
02:54:22,639 --> 02:54:24,399
So you try to go back and you're like, fuck.

1899
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:26,299
What did I do wrong?

1900
02:54:26,860 --> 02:55:02,350
Three, two, two, four.

1901
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:04,350
No, but that's not right.

1902
02:55:04,350 --> 02:55:05,870
Why, what's so wrong here?

1903
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:09,950
You know what I mean?

1904
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:11,629
Like this is so wrong.

1905
02:55:11,629 --> 02:55:13,469
Something fucked up in here.

1906
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:16,290
Either this is wrong or this is wrong.

1907
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:19,219
E and F seven.

1908
02:55:19,219 --> 02:55:20,100
E seven, F seven.

1909
02:55:26,979 --> 02:55:29,540
Something like right here is just bogus.

1910
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:38,260
Just if I could just work around it.

1911
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:38,899
Yeah, that's true.

1912
02:55:38,899 --> 02:55:39,940
I could just work around it.

1913
02:55:40,579 --> 02:55:45,840
So now one, two, three, four, five.

1914
02:55:46,479 --> 02:55:51,950
This is the only possibility is this.

1915
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:54,450
It can't be anything else.

1916
02:55:55,010 --> 02:56:02,399
Then if that's the case, let me remove this.

1917
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:05,920
So there's two here.

1918
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:06,799
There's two again.

1919
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:11,569
Two, there's the two.

1920
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:13,540
Cover that.

1921
02:56:14,540 --> 02:56:15,260
There's your three.

1922
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:15,979
There's your two.

1923
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:17,659
There's your four.

1924
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:19,940
I think I fixed it.

1925
02:56:20,579 --> 02:56:23,020
Yeah, I think I got it.

1926
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:26,020
Yep, and there's five.

1927
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:26,340
Perfect.

1928
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:27,059
Okay, thank God.

1929
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:32,500
There it is.

1930
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:33,059
Okay, nice.

1931
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:43,139
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1932
02:56:43,139 --> 02:56:44,100
No, it's wrong again.

1933
02:56:49,629 --> 02:56:50,430
What happened here?

1934
02:56:55,389 --> 02:57:05,700
Because two and then four.

1935
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:06,500
All right.

1936
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:08,180
Is everything else intact still?

1937
02:57:14,299 --> 02:57:14,940
I think so.

1938
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:15,899
Everything's intact.

1939
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:30,299
Guess resident sleeper.

1940
02:57:30,299 --> 02:57:31,579
That's not what it is.

1941
02:57:31,579 --> 02:57:33,069
I'm going to try again.

1942
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:46,139
Well, that takes care of that.

1943
02:57:55,729 --> 02:58:00,540
All right, saved.

1944
02:58:00,540 --> 02:58:02,459
One, two, three, four, seven.

1945
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:06,620
I've got a lot to erase here.

1946
02:58:10,829 --> 02:58:17,340
All right, it's two again.

1947
02:58:24,590 --> 02:58:28,700
I think it's resident sleeper.

1948
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:29,340
Close.

1949
02:58:29,340 --> 02:58:30,299
Close, very close.

1950
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:34,850
So this is a food.

1951
02:58:34,850 --> 02:58:36,209
What type of food is this?

1952
02:58:52,579 --> 02:59:35,139
Uh-oh, and then, and then.

1953
02:59:35,139 --> 02:59:39,059
Oh, it's so close.

1954
02:59:39,059 --> 02:59:40,340
It's right here.

1955
02:59:40,340 --> 02:59:46,129
Got it.

1956
02:59:46,129 --> 02:59:46,770
What is it?

1957
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:48,139
Cookie?

1958
02:59:48,139 --> 02:59:49,899
It looks like a croissant.

1959
02:59:49,899 --> 02:59:52,620
Look at that croissant.

1960
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:54,700
A lot of you did, actually.

1961
02:59:54,700 --> 03:00:02,020
Nice work.

1962
03:00:02,020 --> 03:00:03,139
Meme food.

1963
03:00:03,139 --> 03:00:05,389
I love croissants.

1964
03:00:05,389 --> 03:00:06,670
The problem with croissants is

1965
03:00:06,670 --> 03:00:08,750
I never order them because

1966
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:11,139
it doesn't matter how you try to eat a croissant.

1967
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:14,020
You get sawdust all over you

1968
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:17,040
like you're in shop class.

1969
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:18,079
Bite into a croissant

1970
03:00:18,079 --> 03:00:21,840
and there's just shavings of wood everywhere.

1971
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:25,569
Don't eat that shit in your car.

1972
03:00:25,569 --> 03:00:33,600
Like you made a birdhouse

1973
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:35,840
in like the, in your passenger side.

1974
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:39,139
10, 11, 12.

1975
03:00:39,139 --> 03:00:40,180
All right, it's 15.

1976
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:41,620
This is construction.

1977
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:42,579
Speaking of construction.

1978
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:48,879
And don't eat in your car.

1979
03:00:48,879 --> 03:00:50,399
Pay attention to the damn road.

1980
03:00:50,399 --> 03:00:57,649
All right, so we got 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1981
03:00:57,649 --> 03:01:02,989
So 11, 12, 13, 14, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1982
03:01:05,299 --> 03:01:06,020
Okay.

1983
03:01:06,020 --> 03:01:13,120
What about over here?

1984
03:01:14,129 --> 03:01:14,629
10.

1985
03:01:15,010 --> 03:01:15,729
Take a look at this.

1986
03:01:15,729 --> 03:01:17,569
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1987
03:01:18,979 --> 03:01:21,219
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

1988
03:01:21,219 --> 03:01:21,860
Cool.

1989
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:22,340
Sick.

1990
03:01:22,340 --> 03:01:22,659
Nice.

1991
03:01:22,659 --> 03:01:23,159
Yeah.

1992
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:30,799
This is definitely not a three.

1993
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:36,059
God, I love Picross.

1994
03:01:36,059 --> 03:01:38,540
I have an unhealthy obsession with these games for some reason.

1995
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:40,860
Me too.

1996
03:01:40,860 --> 03:01:41,659
I come back to it.

1997
03:01:42,299 --> 03:01:45,729
They have a couple of great ones for iPad.

1998
03:01:48,700 --> 03:01:51,100
I just open my mouth and lie in bed on iPad

1999
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:53,340
and play these maybe like once or twice a week.

2000
03:01:53,979 --> 03:01:55,969
Picross, yeah.

2001
03:01:55,969 --> 03:01:59,010
I say Picross because it's like saying Reese's.

2002
03:02:00,819 --> 03:02:02,260
Reese's Pieces.

2003
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:03,700
I don't say Reese's Pieces.

2004
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:07,409
We've had a conversation about this, I know.

2005
03:02:07,409 --> 03:02:11,170
But it's nice to come back and see

2006
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:12,610
how we're doing in that conversation.

2007
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:20,959
So now what?

2008
03:02:24,610 --> 03:02:26,450
Well, that's not a three.

2009
03:02:27,250 --> 03:02:28,270
Neither is that.

2010
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:30,719
Narrow down our 11 here.

2011
03:02:40,659 --> 03:02:42,639
Doesn't help very much.

2012
03:02:46,239 --> 03:02:47,280
It's Reese's.

2013
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,290
There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.

2014
03:02:51,010 --> 03:03:01,379
And there's no wrong way to say Reese's either.

2015
03:03:01,379 --> 03:03:04,610
All right.

2016
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:06,209
Let's put this to bed once and for all.

2017
03:03:08,829 --> 03:03:09,709
Everyone's saying I'm wrong.

2018
03:03:09,709 --> 03:03:12,270
You're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

2019
03:03:12,270 --> 03:03:18,510
Let's see.

2020
03:03:18,510 --> 03:03:19,469
I'm curious.

2021
03:03:19,469 --> 03:03:52,690
I just want to get a poll and chat's opinion on the whole thing.

2022
03:03:58,430 --> 03:04:01,229
Every stream is the same argument over pronunciation.

2023
03:04:01,229 --> 03:04:01,469
Yeah.

2024
03:04:01,469 --> 03:04:02,670
Some people have accents.

2025
03:04:02,670 --> 03:04:04,350
Some people say things differently.

2026
03:04:05,069 --> 03:04:05,870
Come on.

2027
03:04:05,870 --> 03:04:12,000
That's one.

2028
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,280
So two, space, one.

2029
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:14,479
So it could be there and then here we go.

2030
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:20,430
So here we go.

2031
03:04:20,430 --> 03:04:24,270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2032
03:04:24,270 --> 03:04:28,379
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2033
03:04:28,379 --> 03:04:34,270
Thank you.

2034
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:41,680
Another one.

2035
03:04:42,399 --> 03:04:44,379
I don't, I hate when there's too many ones.

2036
03:04:47,420 --> 03:05:00,799
Well, so 30% of you guys from the sampling here say it that way as a Reese's.

2037
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:05,860
The bookstore is closing.

2038
03:05:07,090 --> 03:05:08,770
No, I'm like, I'm not leaving.

2039
03:05:11,409 --> 03:05:12,690
I'm not leaving the bookstore.

2040
03:05:13,329 --> 03:05:21,340
What else can I do here?

2041
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:25,649
There's shit posting.

2042
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:37,549
So, well, it's definitely not down here because this is the three.

2043
03:05:38,860 --> 03:05:39,739
One, two, three.

2044
03:05:39,739 --> 03:05:40,299
So look at that.

2045
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:49,340
We got our nine and our two.

2046
03:05:58,510 --> 03:05:59,229
Is it the whole thing?

2047
03:05:59,790 --> 03:06:00,829
Oh, I'm stupid.

2048
03:06:02,340 --> 03:06:03,860
Just fucking Reese posting.

2049
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:08,000
Reese's PCs.

2050
03:06:08,559 --> 03:06:10,700
It's how I've been saying it since I was a kid.

2051
03:06:10,700 --> 03:06:11,659
I can't change it now.

2052
03:06:20,739 --> 03:06:22,579
I have to, no, Reese's PCs.

2053
03:06:23,219 --> 03:06:25,100
Then you were wrong as a kid.

2054
03:06:28,510 --> 03:06:29,069
That's fine.

2055
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:32,239
I'd like how it sounds better.

2056
03:06:42,930 --> 03:06:44,129
Fair enough.

2057
03:06:44,129 --> 03:06:51,469
There's a one in here somewhere.

2058
03:06:51,469 --> 03:07:11,180
Might be here.

2059
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:15,059
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2060
03:07:18,860 --> 03:07:19,579
Something's wrong here.

2061
03:07:21,260 --> 03:07:24,020
What's wrong here?

2062
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:27,940
This is not, this is all right.

2063
03:07:27,940 --> 03:07:28,739
This is fine, right?

2064
03:07:29,459 --> 03:07:48,129
Oh, this is okay.

2065
03:07:48,129 --> 03:07:51,010
The future is now, old man.

2066
03:07:51,010 --> 03:07:51,409
What do you mean?

2067
03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:55,469
I don't know what that means.

2068
03:07:56,110 --> 03:08:04,670
I mean the future is now.

2069
03:08:05,229 --> 03:08:14,110
Is that too many tens?

2070
03:08:21,440 --> 03:08:22,239
Your time is up.

2071
03:08:22,239 --> 03:08:23,440
My time is now.

2072
03:08:23,440 --> 03:08:30,319
I got plenty of time.

2073
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:41,020
What do we got?

2074
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:42,299
Well, one's one.

2075
03:08:42,299 --> 03:08:45,899
One, three, one.

2076
03:08:48,340 --> 03:08:49,780
This is some kind of construction.

2077
03:08:49,780 --> 03:08:51,620
Was it building material?

2078
03:08:52,500 --> 03:08:52,819
Wood?

2079
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:54,420
I would say wood.

2080
03:08:55,059 --> 03:09:11,889
This could be one, one, three.

2081
03:09:12,610 --> 03:09:14,159
I don't want to blow it.

2082
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:16,559
This on the other hand is one.

2083
03:09:16,559 --> 03:09:17,440
This is three here.

2084
03:09:20,670 --> 03:09:21,709
How does that change this?

2085
03:09:22,750 --> 03:09:24,930
All right.

2086
03:09:25,649 --> 03:09:37,420
Where's this last three right here?

2087
03:09:37,420 --> 03:09:38,379
No, don't guess.

2088
03:09:39,260 --> 03:09:47,250
Three, one, three.

2089
03:09:47,809 --> 03:09:54,079
Sure don't miss any place I can fill in.

2090
03:09:55,360 --> 03:09:55,840
Right there.

2091
03:09:55,840 --> 03:10:03,889
And this three is the right there.

2092
03:10:04,370 --> 03:10:04,530
All right.

2093
03:10:04,530 --> 03:10:05,010
What is it?

2094
03:10:10,770 --> 03:10:11,489
Stairs?

2095
03:10:12,370 --> 03:10:15,040
Oh, damn.

2096
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:15,360
Okay.

2097
03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:18,540
I think that makes sense.

2098
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:22,540
A lot of twos.

2099
03:10:23,260 --> 03:10:26,620
Two, four, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

2100
03:10:26,620 --> 03:10:26,940
Damn it.

2101
03:10:27,500 --> 03:10:31,899
Not enough twos.

2102
03:10:31,899 --> 03:10:42,049
I can start off down here though.

2103
03:10:42,049 --> 03:10:42,530
That's good.

2104
03:10:43,409 --> 03:10:50,530
This whole bottom area is just three.

2105
03:10:51,569 --> 03:10:54,290
Cool.

2106
03:10:54,290 --> 03:10:56,530
It helps a lot.

2107
03:10:59,940 --> 03:11:00,979
And there's our three right here.

2108
03:11:00,979 --> 03:11:01,379
Perfect.

2109
03:11:01,379 --> 03:11:02,340
There's another two.

2110
03:11:02,340 --> 03:11:03,379
Another two.

2111
03:11:03,379 --> 03:11:04,020
That's a one.

2112
03:11:04,659 --> 03:11:07,969
Another two.

2113
03:11:07,969 --> 03:11:08,530
Yes.

2114
03:11:08,530 --> 03:11:09,489
Shit, a lot of twos.

2115
03:11:09,489 --> 03:11:11,329
Keep that in mind while we're progressing.

2116
03:11:12,450 --> 03:11:16,860
Two, three.

2117
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:22,260
Here.

2118
03:11:22,819 --> 03:11:24,370
More twos.

2119
03:11:24,370 --> 03:11:26,049
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two.

2120
03:11:27,100 --> 03:11:29,420
It's probably mirrored, right?

2121
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:30,059
I would assume.

2122
03:11:31,090 --> 03:11:31,809
Is it mirrored?

2123
03:11:31,809 --> 03:11:32,370
No, it's not.

2124
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:36,299
It's my turn.

2125
03:11:36,860 --> 03:11:42,530
No, it's my turn.

2126
03:11:43,090 --> 03:11:50,700
Three.

2127
03:11:50,700 --> 03:11:51,579
There's another one.

2128
03:11:51,579 --> 03:11:51,899
All right.

2129
03:11:52,700 --> 03:11:55,729
So weirdly enough, this is not mirrored.

2130
03:11:55,729 --> 03:11:55,969
Why?

2131
03:11:56,770 --> 03:11:59,780
Two, two, one, one, two.

2132
03:11:59,780 --> 03:12:01,299
Two, one, one, one, two.

2133
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:05,149
I'd like a turn, please.

2134
03:12:07,379 --> 03:12:07,620
No.

2135
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:12,590
So this is from fantasy.

2136
03:12:13,149 --> 03:12:15,940
Whatever that means.

2137
03:12:15,940 --> 03:12:19,409
Concerned that this is wrong already.

2138
03:12:19,409 --> 03:12:20,450
But I don't think it is.

2139
03:12:21,090 --> 03:12:27,520
There's too many spaces here.

2140
03:12:28,079 --> 03:12:28,639
What about here?

2141
03:12:30,139 --> 03:12:32,479
This is another one.

2142
03:12:32,479 --> 03:12:33,040
Another one.

2143
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:33,840
And another one.

2144
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:34,479
Okay.

2145
03:12:34,479 --> 03:12:36,110
Is he enough?

2146
03:12:36,110 --> 03:12:36,829
Same thing over here?

2147
03:12:37,549 --> 03:12:43,010
That's all I can go off of at the moment.

2148
03:12:43,010 --> 03:12:48,319
No, this like fucks with my head.

2149
03:12:48,319 --> 03:12:52,590
All right.

2150
03:12:52,590 --> 03:12:53,069
Slow down.

2151
03:12:53,629 --> 03:12:56,610
It's one, two, three, four.

2152
03:12:59,329 --> 03:13:00,850
One, two, three, four.

2153
03:13:00,850 --> 03:13:02,530
So none of these in the middle are going to be filled in.

2154
03:13:07,780 --> 03:13:08,579
Any others like that?

2155
03:13:08,579 --> 03:13:08,819
Yeah.

2156
03:13:08,819 --> 03:13:09,219
Three.

2157
03:13:09,219 --> 03:13:11,379
One, two, so one, two, three.

2158
03:13:12,260 --> 03:13:14,299
All right.

2159
03:13:16,350 --> 03:13:17,629
Any more like that?

2160
03:13:22,479 --> 03:13:22,799
Maybe.

2161
03:13:25,819 --> 03:13:27,420
What is telling you to fill in what squares?

2162
03:13:29,090 --> 03:13:30,290
We're like really relaxed.

2163
03:13:31,170 --> 03:13:33,010
We're just chill now.

2164
03:13:33,010 --> 03:13:33,729
I can explain it.

2165
03:13:34,450 --> 03:13:36,829
Because there are actually people that are asking questions.

2166
03:13:37,469 --> 03:13:43,489
You know, people are asking questions.

2167
03:13:43,969 --> 03:13:48,239
So let's start with this.

2168
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:54,479
The cubes that you're filling in correspond to the numbers.

2169
03:13:54,479 --> 03:13:56,139
So for instance, three.

2170
03:13:56,780 --> 03:14:01,260
That means that there has to be three squares filled in in a row for this number here.

2171
03:14:01,819 --> 03:14:03,409
This way, right?

2172
03:14:03,409 --> 03:14:04,290
Because on this row.

2173
03:14:05,299 --> 03:14:08,420
Now, the one here means that after you, the three,

2174
03:14:08,420 --> 03:14:17,790
there has to be at least one space before that one comes into play.

2175
03:14:17,790 --> 03:14:21,469
So again, let's just say for the sake of just doing it,

2176
03:14:21,870 --> 03:14:26,430
it was three, space, one, space, right?

2177
03:14:26,430 --> 03:14:27,870
Because there's a space before this one.

2178
03:14:29,069 --> 03:14:31,389
One, space, two, right?

2179
03:14:31,389 --> 03:14:33,309
That would be, this is not correct.

2180
03:14:33,309 --> 03:14:37,219
But that space can be one or it can be eight.

2181
03:14:37,219 --> 03:14:39,739
Doesn't matter.

2182
03:14:39,739 --> 03:14:41,340
And you're supposed to logically deduce,

2183
03:14:41,979 --> 03:14:44,190
I just fucked up this whole line.

2184
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:46,430
What was it?

2185
03:14:48,190 --> 03:14:49,469
No, okay, I'm fine.

2186
03:14:49,469 --> 03:14:55,100
That is only one.

2187
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:55,340
Yeah.

2188
03:14:56,219 --> 03:14:59,180
So if it's 15 by 15, you start,

2189
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:01,020
for instance, see how I started down here.

2190
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:06,159
Filled in all 15, all 15 again.

2191
03:15:06,159 --> 03:15:08,079
And that completed these rows.

2192
03:15:08,079 --> 03:15:10,000
Now what happens is then take a look up here, right?

2193
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,959
Because this is the top of the grid.

2194
03:15:12,959 --> 03:15:14,770
This is the bottom of the grid.

2195
03:15:14,770 --> 03:15:16,930
So you work from the bottom up here.

2196
03:15:16,930 --> 03:15:17,969
So see how that's two.

2197
03:15:18,850 --> 03:15:20,450
Both are filled in here.

2198
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:21,409
That's done.

2199
03:15:21,409 --> 03:15:24,819
So then you put a marker here

2200
03:15:24,819 --> 03:15:26,819
because you know that there has to be at least one space.

2201
03:15:29,469 --> 03:15:32,770
See how down here, once I filled in this row again,

2202
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:34,610
there's three, one, two, three has to get filled in.

2203
03:15:34,610 --> 03:15:35,729
Marker has to go here.

2204
03:15:35,729 --> 03:15:41,389
It's very interesting, very relaxing.

2205
03:15:41,389 --> 03:15:42,270
And it makes a picture.

2206
03:15:42,270 --> 03:15:43,469
That's the best part.

2207
03:15:43,469 --> 03:15:46,579
Okay, but how do you play it?

2208
03:15:47,299 --> 03:15:53,790
Okay, but how do you play it?

2209
03:15:53,790 --> 03:16:08,450
You know how to play.

2210
03:16:08,450 --> 03:16:09,729
I don't get it.

2211
03:16:09,729 --> 03:16:13,090
I'll make it really easy after this level.

2212
03:16:13,649 --> 03:16:16,049
For the handful of people.

2213
03:16:16,049 --> 03:16:17,809
Yeah, I mean, there's 2,500 people here.

2214
03:16:17,809 --> 03:16:20,850
And maybe 2,400 of you get it.

2215
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:22,770
But what about the new people that came in

2216
03:16:22,770 --> 03:16:25,090
that just want to, you know, are curious?

2217
03:16:25,729 --> 03:16:26,620
We're just hanging out.

2218
03:16:26,620 --> 03:16:28,379
It's not like, it's not a big deal.

2219
03:16:29,870 --> 03:16:30,670
Not a big deal at all.

2220
03:16:31,229 --> 03:16:31,889
It's fine.

2221
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:37,780
All right, so let's get back to it.

2222
03:16:38,420 --> 03:16:44,989
Three, I sense sarcasm.

2223
03:16:44,989 --> 03:16:46,270
No, that's an old reference.

2224
03:16:46,909 --> 03:16:52,180
This could be the one, because then that's two.

2225
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:57,340
But I did give myself this, which is good.

2226
03:16:57,340 --> 03:16:59,899
So this could be one, two, three, four.

2227
03:16:59,899 --> 03:17:01,659
One, two, three, four.

2228
03:17:01,659 --> 03:17:05,790
So, okay.

2229
03:17:13,899 --> 03:17:15,100
No, that's not, I don't have that info.

2230
03:17:15,819 --> 03:17:20,430
Because that would mean it could be here, but it's not.

2231
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:23,920
So I got another two, right?

2232
03:17:23,920 --> 03:17:27,069
Because it's two, two, two.

2233
03:17:27,629 --> 03:17:30,270
Same thing on this one, right?

2234
03:17:30,270 --> 03:17:31,229
No, that's two, one.

2235
03:17:33,920 --> 03:17:34,879
So that's three, one.

2236
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:36,799
That's a one, which makes this the three.

2237
03:17:37,920 --> 03:17:38,479
Perfect, done.

2238
03:17:42,610 --> 03:17:44,129
No info required.

2239
03:17:44,850 --> 03:17:48,959
Somebody just guess ham.

2240
03:17:49,600 --> 03:17:50,559
Why would this be ham?

2241
03:17:50,559 --> 03:17:51,120
Two, one.

2242
03:17:52,770 --> 03:17:53,889
Two, wait, wait, wait.

2243
03:17:53,889 --> 03:17:55,170
Two, one.

2244
03:17:55,170 --> 03:17:56,989
That's one.

2245
03:17:57,979 --> 03:17:59,340
Wait a minute, two, one, one.

2246
03:17:59,340 --> 03:17:59,979
This could be two.

2247
03:18:00,620 --> 03:18:04,459
What about this one?

2248
03:18:04,459 --> 03:18:06,540
Two, two, two.

2249
03:18:07,260 --> 03:18:12,079
Need more info down here.

2250
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:22,940
Yes, space invader.

2251
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:24,219
Now that's a pretty good one.

2252
03:18:24,219 --> 03:18:25,659
That's actually a really good guess.

2253
03:18:27,329 --> 03:18:28,209
It very well could be.

2254
03:18:31,629 --> 03:18:37,790
Let's fill this shit in, because this has to be here or here.

2255
03:18:37,790 --> 03:18:39,940
And one, two, three.

2256
03:18:39,940 --> 03:18:41,379
This is all no.

2257
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:45,219
And this is filled in.

2258
03:18:47,200 --> 03:18:50,340
Two, two, two, two.

2259
03:18:50,340 --> 03:18:50,979
This is done.

2260
03:18:51,780 --> 03:18:53,809
Okay, nice.

2261
03:18:54,620 --> 03:18:55,180
Is it?

2262
03:18:55,180 --> 03:18:55,899
I'm confused.

2263
03:18:55,899 --> 03:19:01,739
I'm going to lead us up here.

2264
03:19:01,739 --> 03:19:02,780
Is this four, one?

2265
03:19:04,590 --> 03:19:08,959
One, two, four, two.

2266
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,879
Four, one, two.

2267
03:19:16,180 --> 03:19:16,899
Four, one.

2268
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:19,329
Could be up there.

2269
03:19:20,209 --> 03:19:21,489
Four, one, one.

2270
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:24,299
But that could be one, one.

2271
03:19:24,299 --> 03:19:25,819
So let's leave that here for a second.

2272
03:19:27,569 --> 03:19:28,370
See what we did up here.

2273
03:19:28,370 --> 03:19:30,049
This is one, this is three.

2274
03:19:31,010 --> 03:19:33,120
There's the two, nice.

2275
03:19:40,399 --> 03:19:41,600
Still not sure about down here.

2276
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:47,870
Two, one, three.

2277
03:19:47,870 --> 03:19:52,020
So could this be two, one, one, three?

2278
03:19:52,020 --> 03:19:52,739
No, this is it.

2279
03:19:53,540 --> 03:20:00,059
So this could be anywhere here.

2280
03:20:00,700 --> 03:20:01,579
All right, got that though.

2281
03:20:02,299 --> 03:20:13,059
Three, two, one.

2282
03:20:13,219 --> 03:20:14,260
All right, this is interesting.

2283
03:20:14,979 --> 03:20:16,100
It's either here or here.

2284
03:20:16,819 --> 03:20:21,809
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2285
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:25,170
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2286
03:20:25,170 --> 03:20:27,090
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2287
03:20:27,969 --> 03:20:30,540
I can't denominate this.

2288
03:20:31,180 --> 03:20:37,229
Hold on, let me see here.

2289
03:20:37,950 --> 03:20:40,739
All right, now I got this now.

2290
03:20:40,739 --> 03:20:43,139
So that's two, one.

2291
03:20:44,959 --> 03:20:57,860
One, two, right?

2292
03:20:57,860 --> 03:21:01,219
Because then now is that.

2293
03:21:01,219 --> 03:21:02,020
This would be three.

2294
03:21:03,059 --> 03:21:11,329
Don't want to get sloppy.

2295
03:21:11,329 --> 03:21:15,950
I'm missing a lot over here.

2296
03:21:15,950 --> 03:21:22,780
Let's see, two, one, one, one, two.

2297
03:21:23,659 --> 03:21:25,500
That's four, close it up.

2298
03:21:25,500 --> 03:21:26,700
That's three, close it.

2299
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:27,579
This is done now.

2300
03:21:27,579 --> 03:21:28,620
All right, I'm almost done.

2301
03:21:29,420 --> 03:21:30,379
What even?

2302
03:21:30,379 --> 03:21:32,700
Maybe this actually might be a space invader.

2303
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:39,469
I have nothing in this row.

2304
03:21:40,030 --> 03:21:40,430
How?

2305
03:21:40,430 --> 03:21:46,270
One, two, three, two, two.

2306
03:21:46,270 --> 03:21:48,430
No, for some reason I thought it was going to count higher than that.

2307
03:21:54,659 --> 03:21:55,940
Two, and there's the one.

2308
03:21:57,409 --> 03:21:57,649
Yes.

2309
03:22:01,059 --> 03:22:06,530
So, well, didn't fill that one in.

2310
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:11,100
All right.

2311
03:22:11,899 --> 03:22:12,860
Where are you?

2312
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:23,149
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2313
03:22:23,149 --> 03:22:24,909
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2314
03:22:27,020 --> 03:22:28,379
Over here, I'm over here.

2315
03:22:29,180 --> 03:22:43,780
Well, it could be here.

2316
03:22:46,239 --> 03:22:50,559
Two, two, three.

2317
03:22:50,559 --> 03:22:52,159
Well, the one is obviously right there.

2318
03:22:59,729 --> 03:23:01,250
In there somewhere, that's done.

2319
03:23:04,299 --> 03:23:05,020
There's three.

2320
03:23:06,459 --> 03:23:08,989
All right, closing in.

2321
03:23:13,629 --> 03:23:15,950
Six, one, two, three, four, five, six.

2322
03:23:16,590 --> 03:23:18,030
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2323
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:20,399
Seal it.

2324
03:23:20,959 --> 03:23:25,120
Two, two, what is it?

2325
03:23:25,120 --> 03:23:27,069
Spider?

2326
03:23:27,069 --> 03:23:28,750
Space invader?

2327
03:23:28,750 --> 03:23:31,520
It's a cave, a dungeon.

2328
03:23:36,989 --> 03:23:37,709
Nobody got it.

2329
03:23:38,350 --> 03:23:39,229
I don't know how you would have.

2330
03:23:44,829 --> 03:23:47,149
This is a very long music track.

2331
03:23:47,149 --> 03:23:49,629
It's, we've been listening to this for an hour and 44 minutes.

2332
03:23:50,190 --> 03:23:51,760
That's kind of surprising.

2333
03:23:52,479 --> 03:23:54,159
All right, electronic.

2334
03:23:54,159 --> 03:23:54,639
What time is it?

2335
03:23:54,639 --> 03:23:55,120
How are we doing?

2336
03:23:57,549 --> 03:23:58,110
Six hours.

2337
03:24:00,020 --> 03:24:02,100
I'm, I'm still all right.

2338
03:24:02,100 --> 03:24:03,059
I'm still just hanging out.

2339
03:24:03,620 --> 03:24:04,180
We're not done.

2340
03:24:04,739 --> 03:24:06,700
I'm going to go for like another little while.

2341
03:24:07,260 --> 03:24:11,840
Put on the Tetris OST.

2342
03:24:12,479 --> 03:24:23,200
But we're so relaxed.

2343
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:32,319
All right, this is Tetris 99, full official soundtrack.

2344
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:46,479
Regular Tet, like you mean like the

2345
03:24:50,479 --> 03:25:04,799
You can fill this whole thing in.

2346
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:37,920
I need more ones.

2347
03:25:38,559 --> 03:25:44,899
I need more.

2348
03:25:44,899 --> 03:25:46,100
It's filling the zeros first.

2349
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:46,819
What the hell am I doing?

2350
03:25:52,879 --> 03:25:54,000
Anymore.

2351
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:56,670
Well, I found the first one.

2352
03:25:56,670 --> 03:26:01,229
And then it could be one, two, three, four.

2353
03:26:01,229 --> 03:26:02,270
One, two, three, four.

2354
03:26:06,319 --> 03:26:06,719
Nice.

2355
03:26:06,719 --> 03:26:07,280
Fill that out.

2356
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:10,690
How are we now?

2357
03:26:10,690 --> 03:26:11,489
One still.

2358
03:26:12,370 --> 03:26:19,149
By this point, you should have had consumed at least 24 ounces of water.

2359
03:26:20,290 --> 03:26:21,489
Uh, I'm probably pretty close.

2360
03:26:22,049 --> 03:26:25,409
I've had a glass of water here the whole time.

2361
03:26:25,409 --> 03:26:39,309
Well, this is, this is the six.

2362
03:26:41,540 --> 03:26:42,819
Therefore, this is the six.

2363
03:26:43,540 --> 03:26:46,479
Then this has to be one, one.

2364
03:26:47,120 --> 03:27:01,870
It's info I don't have, but I can do at least those two.

2365
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:04,340
What's the song called?

2366
03:27:04,340 --> 03:27:07,299
This is called Tetris 99 Main Theme.

2367
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:15,059
You can download it off of the internet somewhere and enjoy it with your friends.

2368
03:27:15,059 --> 03:27:20,780
You can throw a party if you wanted to and put it on a six and a half hour repeat.

2369
03:27:22,399 --> 03:27:25,680
You could, I'm not saying you should, but I'm just saying it's possible.

2370
03:27:31,139 --> 03:27:33,299
Torrenting Tetris music.

2371
03:27:33,299 --> 03:27:34,340
No, that's not what I mean.

2372
03:27:35,139 --> 03:27:43,780
This has to be the six, right?

2373
03:27:43,780 --> 03:27:44,100
Yeah.

2374
03:27:44,100 --> 03:27:45,940
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2375
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:47,780
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2376
03:27:48,579 --> 03:27:49,079
Yeah.

2377
03:28:02,219 --> 03:28:03,260
One of these is the two.

2378
03:28:03,979 --> 03:28:05,180
This one's probably the two.

2379
03:28:08,799 --> 03:28:09,840
If not, then it's down here.

2380
03:28:10,559 --> 03:28:11,360
Well, here's the eight.

2381
03:28:23,819 --> 03:28:24,620
How much did I fill in?

2382
03:28:24,620 --> 03:28:25,020
I forget.

2383
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:27,840
Oh, shit.

2384
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:28,639
I don't know.

2385
03:28:28,639 --> 03:28:29,440
I'm just gonna go like this.

2386
03:28:34,459 --> 03:28:35,819
That's more info than I had before.

2387
03:28:35,819 --> 03:28:36,299
I'm okay.

2388
03:28:44,930 --> 03:28:46,290
Is it all filled in?

2389
03:28:46,290 --> 03:28:53,200
Get a one and then a two up here somewhere.

2390
03:28:53,760 --> 03:28:57,469
This is something electronic.

2391
03:29:04,110 --> 03:29:04,510
Six.

2392
03:29:08,100 --> 03:29:08,899
So many ones.

2393
03:29:10,930 --> 03:29:14,940
Three, one, three.

2394
03:29:15,659 --> 03:29:17,840
More ones.

2395
03:29:22,899 --> 03:29:24,020
All right, what is this two?

2396
03:29:27,620 --> 03:29:29,459
You want the pirate marching band?

2397
03:29:35,459 --> 03:29:35,959
Why?

2398
03:29:36,500 --> 03:29:48,379
Do you really want me to put on the pirate marching band right now?

2399
03:29:56,479 --> 03:29:56,979
I...

2400
03:29:56,979 --> 03:29:58,079
Okay, hold on a minute.

2401
03:29:58,719 --> 03:30:01,920
This video has almost a million views.

2402
03:30:03,969 --> 03:30:08,370
There's a 737, 34,000 view video

2403
03:30:08,370 --> 03:30:13,489
and then a 173,000 re-upload for 10 hours.

2404
03:30:13,489 --> 03:30:14,290
This video has almost...

2405
03:30:14,290 --> 03:30:15,889
This video has been seen a million times.

2406
03:30:18,059 --> 03:30:18,459
Really?

2407
03:30:19,020 --> 03:30:19,899
I didn't even know that.

2408
03:30:19,899 --> 03:30:20,620
Holy shit.

2409
03:30:21,260 --> 03:30:30,510
Here it comes.

2410
03:30:39,540 --> 03:30:43,659
I little did I know that this year...

2411
03:30:43,659 --> 03:30:45,020
This many years later.

2412
03:30:45,020 --> 03:30:46,219
This stupid thing that I did.

2413
03:30:48,700 --> 03:30:55,309
Played at half speed.

2414
03:31:00,350 --> 03:31:01,229
Also not even true.

2415
03:31:04,690 --> 03:31:06,450
This is how I found out about you.

2416
03:31:07,809 --> 03:31:09,569
I imagine that conversation.

2417
03:31:09,569 --> 03:31:11,329
Hey, here's this guy that I have watched.

2418
03:31:11,329 --> 03:31:16,190
Check him out.

2419
03:31:16,190 --> 03:31:16,690
Two.

2420
03:31:34,340 --> 03:31:37,139
Don't you wish this was broadcasted nationally 4 AM

2421
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:41,709
at everyone's alarm clocks?

2422
03:31:42,270 --> 03:31:44,989
I'm not entirely certain that I would like to do that

2423
03:31:46,799 --> 03:31:48,399
because that would probably get really bad.

2424
03:31:48,399 --> 03:31:49,440
Something just auto-played.

2425
03:31:53,090 --> 03:31:57,260
This is YMCA, but it's got a twist.

2426
03:32:13,870 --> 03:32:20,670
How long is this?

2427
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:22,430
There are so many rat remixes.

2428
03:32:22,909 --> 03:32:24,049
I've heard a bunch of them.

2429
03:32:24,690 --> 03:32:26,459
All right, where am I going here?

2430
03:32:27,340 --> 03:32:28,139
Probably down here.

2431
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:42,260
I can't focus on anything else.

2432
03:32:46,799 --> 03:32:51,739
Two, three, I have six.

2433
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:54,139
One, six.

2434
03:32:56,639 --> 03:32:58,719
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2435
03:32:58,719 --> 03:33:00,639
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2436
03:33:03,379 --> 03:33:09,500
Ah, three, one, one.

2437
03:33:12,430 --> 03:33:15,219
I'm getting speech jammed.

2438
03:33:16,020 --> 03:33:19,489
It's still going.

2439
03:33:30,579 --> 03:33:33,379
I can't do it with this music playing.

2440
03:33:33,379 --> 03:33:41,040
Why did that take this long to play these songs?

2441
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:42,590
I don't know.

2442
03:33:42,590 --> 03:33:44,030
It just kind of never came up.

2443
03:33:44,670 --> 03:33:49,649
I need more info.

2444
03:33:52,399 --> 03:33:54,159
A poor craftsman blames his tools.

2445
03:33:54,959 --> 03:33:57,440
Or, okay, if you were making a birdhouse

2446
03:33:57,440 --> 03:33:58,719
and I came in and started going,

2447
03:33:58,719 --> 03:34:00,479
Retch, retch, we had a retch.

2448
03:34:01,620 --> 03:34:02,739
In your ear, you'd probably be like,

2449
03:34:03,299 --> 03:34:03,940
what are you doing?

2450
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:14,739
No, no, no.

2451
03:34:14,739 --> 03:34:15,940
What's the next one?

2452
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:17,280
This is the mixtape.

2453
03:34:18,299 --> 03:34:19,420
I think this is just the original one.

2454
03:34:32,860 --> 03:34:35,889
I can't.

2455
03:34:41,409 --> 03:34:43,010
Yeah, I know that that's on osu!

2456
03:34:44,659 --> 03:34:45,059
Where am I?

2457
03:34:45,059 --> 03:34:47,299
I'm like going forward, forward, forward.

2458
03:34:48,110 --> 03:34:49,950
I skipped the best part?

2459
03:34:49,950 --> 03:34:50,909
What do you mean the best part?

2460
03:34:51,629 --> 03:34:54,540
What happened to my smooth jazz?

2461
03:34:55,180 --> 03:34:57,020
I was working on my brain function.

2462
03:35:01,969 --> 03:35:03,969
How long does it take you to make those lyrics?

2463
03:35:03,969 --> 03:35:08,909
Uh, six or seven minutes, probably.

2464
03:35:08,909 --> 03:35:09,629
Maybe ten minutes.

2465
03:35:10,190 --> 03:35:11,940
There's a new one that I have.

2466
03:35:13,389 --> 03:35:15,389
And it was supposed to be for the third one.

2467
03:35:15,389 --> 03:35:16,430
I might as well just do it.

2468
03:35:16,430 --> 03:35:17,469
I might as well just tell you what it was.

2469
03:35:20,049 --> 03:35:23,389
Yeah, well, this is a secret chillout stream.

2470
03:35:24,909 --> 03:35:28,030
Would you like to load the lyrics for the third rat song?

2471
03:35:30,659 --> 03:35:32,260
Because I can't imagine a time

2472
03:35:32,260 --> 03:35:33,620
where I'm going to be able to work on it for real.

2473
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:36,000
And if you hear it, it's fine.

2474
03:35:37,139 --> 03:35:39,620
So it was a little play on words.

2475
03:35:41,870 --> 03:35:46,430
it's the same sentence, but three times means different things.

2476
03:35:47,149 --> 03:35:47,870
Are you ready?

2477
03:35:48,430 --> 03:35:52,399
So it starts off like a like a rap beat almost.

2478
03:35:53,280 --> 03:35:58,639
And it goes.

2479
03:36:15,600 --> 03:36:34,590
where they at where they at there you go that actually was the whole song it is

2480
03:36:34,590 --> 03:36:44,649
that's how it is gonna be like bunches fucking trumpets sounds gonna make a

2481
03:36:44,649 --> 03:36:49,620
real one that's fine yeah it was where the rats where the rats just where the

2482
03:36:49,620 --> 03:36:57,649
rats where they at where they at yeah where the rats like this you know now

2483
03:36:57,649 --> 03:37:09,139
you already you know yeah like where the rats then where are the rats where

2484
03:37:09,139 --> 03:37:13,860
they at they've got to come out of the sewers and shit while it was

2485
03:37:13,860 --> 03:37:16,979
playing they're all gonna get more crowded more people more rats singing at

2486
03:37:16,979 --> 03:37:23,200
the same time that's where to go that that that's the song that is the song

2487
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:33,750
let's go make it let's make it right now yeah fuck it I'll bear it back

2488
03:37:33,750 --> 03:42:18,510
hold on I'm still going I remember I said seven to eight minutes it was

2489
03:42:18,510 --> 03:42:24,870
probably a lie probably took like 30 probably like an hour let me get let

2490
03:42:24,870 --> 03:42:28,620
me make sure this is going here I wasn't just gonna pull a song from

2491
03:42:28,620 --> 03:42:31,459
royalty-free I was gonna have it made so there's no song to go along

2492
03:42:31,459 --> 03:42:49,370
with it I can zoom in here I'm gonna do take figure oh yeah here

2493
03:42:49,370 --> 03:42:57,139
comes a take a live take I'll do I'm gonna do one part of it it's easier to

2494
03:42:57,139 --> 03:43:13,250
do in two breaths and that's a little bit of them this has a little cleaner

2495
03:43:13,250 --> 03:43:21,930
you want to make that I'll just make the fucking thing right now hold on

2496
03:43:21,930 --> 03:43:31,239
it's gonna be louder though it's kind of soft and I'll just do like a

2497
03:43:31,239 --> 03:43:38,139
little I'll do like a little beatbox behind it

2498
03:43:38,139 --> 03:43:41,899
where the rats where the rats just where the rats need to be a little

2499
03:43:41,899 --> 03:44:04,819
higher than that not that much rat lore incoming I

2500
03:44:04,899 --> 03:44:10,920
wouldn't say rat lore let's see how does this sound

2501
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:25,180
no a little off here I moved it too much I need to really unfortunately have

2502
03:44:25,180 --> 03:44:30,139
to crank my microphone for this I really don't think I can actually do it

2503
03:44:30,139 --> 03:44:47,969
on stream it's a way off key as well way off key it's got to change I was

2504
03:44:47,969 --> 03:45:06,100
here that's not bad let me turn this up

2505
03:45:12,809 --> 03:45:37,469
I am here six years later he did it on stream in 20 minutes perfect okay

2506
03:45:37,510 --> 03:45:49,020
how about the next part next part is to be a little bit more a little bit more

2507
03:45:49,020 --> 03:46:10,479
synced up here audacity why do you suck what's going on here why can I not

2508
03:46:10,479 --> 03:46:30,290
move this oh that's why something is wrong here what's going on

2509
03:46:30,290 --> 03:46:37,309
audacity what are you doing wait yeah audacity what are you doing to me

2510
03:46:37,309 --> 03:46:50,680
why can I not drag this what the hell the fuck is going on here yeah

2511
03:46:51,680 --> 03:47:00,409
for some reason I cannot move the track anymore it's like broken you know

2512
03:47:00,409 --> 03:47:04,250
audacity really is terrible for recording tracks but I kind of just

2513
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:12,049
threw this open so I don't understand why I can't do this I've done this

2514
03:47:12,049 --> 03:47:16,389
probably I've done this probably a thousand times and I cannot select this

2515
03:47:16,389 --> 03:47:20,469
and move it and now magically I didn't even magic I can do it now

2516
03:47:20,469 --> 03:47:34,000
somebody has magic fucking potions see how this sounds

2517
03:47:36,360 --> 03:47:43,889
not bad not bad maybe needs a little bit more on the end here and then I'm

2518
03:47:43,889 --> 03:47:58,510
gonna copy it once and I'll give you a real take how's this we're gonna retch

2519
03:47:58,510 --> 03:48:05,879
whether yet whether yet yet we're gonna retch good we're gonna retch we're

2520
03:48:05,879 --> 03:48:12,909
gonna retch just we're gonna retch pull that forward a little just a hair

2521
03:48:12,909 --> 03:48:17,139
we're gonna retch we're gonna retch just we're gonna retch we're gonna get

2522
03:48:18,139 --> 03:48:26,079
all right here comes a new take

2523
03:48:44,680 --> 03:48:57,260
yeah it's problem with audacity is when you record it puts everything else off

2524
03:48:57,260 --> 03:49:05,940
sync for some reason you can't have to go back in this is just for fun I'm

2525
03:49:05,940 --> 03:49:11,750
I'm not really trying to get it perfect or anything, I just want to get you an idea.

2526
03:49:11,750 --> 03:49:17,799
Need two headphones in for this.

2527
03:49:17,799 --> 03:49:24,780
I don't like that one.

2528
03:49:24,780 --> 03:49:32,459
I like the end of that though.

2529
03:49:32,459 --> 03:49:33,940
No.

2530
03:49:33,940 --> 03:49:43,299
Do it again.

2531
03:49:43,299 --> 03:49:46,809
No, do it again.

2532
03:49:46,809 --> 03:49:50,670
It's going to be like, way to yet, way to yet.

2533
03:49:50,670 --> 03:49:54,489
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2534
03:49:54,489 --> 03:49:58,260
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2535
03:49:58,260 --> 03:49:59,260
Fucking audacity.

2536
03:49:59,260 --> 03:50:02,079
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2537
03:50:02,079 --> 03:50:05,079
Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to retch.

2538
03:50:05,079 --> 03:50:12,270
No, why?

2539
03:50:12,270 --> 03:50:16,020
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2540
03:50:16,020 --> 03:50:31,600
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2541
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:34,479
Okay, let's change that a little bit.

2542
03:50:34,479 --> 03:50:40,280
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2543
03:50:40,280 --> 03:50:45,680
This is how you do it, man.

2544
03:50:45,680 --> 03:50:46,680
This is what I used to do.

2545
03:50:46,680 --> 03:50:52,670
I used to sit here and fucking do this all day.

2546
03:50:52,670 --> 03:50:55,670
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2547
03:50:55,670 --> 03:50:59,379
That's not so fucking wrong.

2548
03:50:59,379 --> 03:51:01,379
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2549
03:51:01,379 --> 03:51:08,809
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah.

2550
03:51:08,809 --> 03:51:10,809
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2551
03:51:10,809 --> 03:51:11,809
No, that's too low.

2552
03:51:11,809 --> 03:51:17,360
Way to retch, way to...

2553
03:51:17,360 --> 03:51:19,360
Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.

2554
03:51:19,360 --> 03:51:25,989
That's the tone I'm looking for.

2555
03:51:25,989 --> 03:51:27,989
I think we can get this copied a couple times.

2556
03:51:27,989 --> 03:51:29,989
Yeah, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2557
03:51:29,989 --> 03:51:32,260
This one's a little too low.

2558
03:51:32,260 --> 03:51:35,459
I'm going to give another take here.

2559
03:51:35,459 --> 03:51:38,139
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2560
03:51:38,139 --> 03:51:45,120
Yeah, way to retch.

2561
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:47,829
No, that would be like...

2562
03:51:47,829 --> 03:51:49,829
Way to retch, way to retch.

2563
03:51:49,829 --> 03:51:52,069
Uh-uh.

2564
03:51:52,069 --> 03:51:54,069
Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2565
03:51:54,069 --> 03:51:55,069
No, that's wrong.

2566
03:51:55,069 --> 03:51:57,950
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2567
03:51:57,950 --> 03:52:05,120
Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2568
03:52:05,120 --> 03:52:13,500
Yeah, yeah, way to retch.

2569
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:18,139
Uh-uh.

2570
03:52:18,139 --> 03:52:19,139
Just way to retch.

2571
03:52:19,139 --> 03:52:22,139
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2572
03:52:22,139 --> 03:52:23,139
No, I can't.

2573
03:52:23,139 --> 03:52:25,719
Move this to creative.

2574
03:52:25,719 --> 03:52:29,239
I'd have to show it.

2575
03:52:29,239 --> 03:52:30,610
Way to retch, way to retch.

2576
03:52:30,610 --> 03:52:31,610
No.

2577
03:52:31,610 --> 03:52:32,610
Way to retch, way to retch.

2578
03:52:32,610 --> 03:52:33,610
Yes, way to retch.

2579
03:52:33,610 --> 03:52:35,610
When it comes up like that.

2580
03:52:35,610 --> 03:52:38,489
I'm naked right now in front of you guys.

2581
03:52:38,489 --> 03:52:39,489
You understand that, right?

2582
03:52:39,489 --> 03:52:43,819
You're seeing me completely undressed in front of you.

2583
03:52:43,819 --> 03:52:51,239
Way to retch, way to retch.

2584
03:52:51,239 --> 03:52:52,239
Yes, way to retch.

2585
03:52:52,239 --> 03:52:54,239
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2586
03:52:54,239 --> 03:52:57,020
He's fucking naked.

2587
03:52:57,020 --> 03:53:01,020
Now let me just get the next part, because this is fine.

2588
03:53:01,020 --> 03:53:03,020
Way to retch, way to yet, way to retch.

2589
03:53:03,020 --> 03:53:06,159
This part needs to be moved, but...

2590
03:53:06,159 --> 03:53:10,190
Yeah, way to retch.

2591
03:53:10,190 --> 03:53:11,370
Okay.

2592
03:53:11,370 --> 03:53:12,370
Then it's...

2593
03:53:12,370 --> 03:53:13,370
Way to retch, way to retch.

2594
03:53:13,370 --> 03:53:14,370
Yes, way to retch.

2595
03:53:14,370 --> 03:53:18,780
Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2596
03:53:18,780 --> 03:53:19,780
Uh-uh.

2597
03:53:19,780 --> 03:53:20,780
Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2598
03:53:20,780 --> 03:53:21,780
Way to retch.

2599
03:53:21,780 --> 03:53:24,239
Uh-uh.

2600
03:53:24,239 --> 03:53:26,239
Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.

2601
03:53:26,239 --> 03:53:27,239
Way to retch, way to retch.

2602
03:53:27,239 --> 03:53:28,239
Yes, way to retch.

2603
03:53:28,239 --> 03:53:30,239
Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2604
03:53:30,239 --> 03:53:35,299
The VRB screen is still on.

2605
03:53:35,299 --> 03:53:36,299
You clown.

2606
03:53:36,299 --> 03:53:37,299
Yeah, way to retch.

2607
03:53:37,299 --> 03:53:49,989
Way to retch.

2608
03:53:49,989 --> 03:53:50,989
Way to retch, way to retch.

2609
03:53:50,989 --> 03:53:51,989
Yes, way to retch.

2610
03:53:51,989 --> 03:53:53,989
Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2611
03:53:53,989 --> 03:53:54,989
I like that end here.

2612
03:53:56,680 --> 03:53:57,680
Okay.

2613
03:53:57,680 --> 03:54:05,700
I should be able to see it now.

2614
03:54:05,700 --> 03:54:12,899
At least I think you can.

2615
03:54:12,899 --> 03:54:13,899
Can you see it?

2616
03:54:13,899 --> 03:54:18,340
No.

2617
03:54:18,340 --> 03:54:20,860
I have to move this.

2618
03:54:20,860 --> 03:54:21,860
Hey, look at that!

2619
03:54:21,860 --> 03:54:22,860
Okay, so as you see here...

2620
03:54:22,860 --> 03:54:29,409
Way to retch, way to retch.

2621
03:54:29,409 --> 03:54:30,409
Yes, way to retch.

2622
03:54:30,409 --> 03:54:38,500
Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2623
03:54:38,500 --> 03:54:39,500
I like the end here.

2624
03:54:39,500 --> 03:54:42,340
I don't like the beginning.

2625
03:54:42,340 --> 03:54:43,340
Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2626
03:54:43,340 --> 03:54:44,340
I like that part.

2627
03:54:44,340 --> 03:54:45,340
Let me see.

2628
03:54:45,340 --> 03:54:46,340
Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2629
03:54:46,340 --> 03:54:47,340
Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2630
03:54:47,340 --> 03:54:49,600
Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

2631
03:54:50,600 --> 03:55:25,950
I like that part.

2632
03:55:25,950 --> 03:55:30,389
That's almost unhuman how much that is the same.

2633
03:55:33,629 --> 03:55:34,629
That's way too close.

2634
03:55:34,629 --> 03:55:39,139
Let's go to...

2635
03:55:39,139 --> 03:55:40,500
Change the pitch a little bit.

2636
03:55:40,500 --> 03:55:41,500
It sounded a little creepy.

2637
03:55:41,500 --> 03:55:47,069
Let's drop it a lot and see what happens.

2638
03:55:47,069 --> 03:55:49,440

I don't know

2783
04:01:59,149 --> 04:02:07,500
hold on

2784
04:02:07,500 --> 04:02:11,079
once was a man named gold rodrits

2785
04:02:11,079 --> 04:02:12,079
he had fame

2786
04:02:12,079 --> 04:02:13,079
power

2787
04:02:13,079 --> 04:02:14,079
and wealth

2788
04:02:14,079 --> 04:02:15,079
beyond your wildest dreams

2789
04:02:15,079 --> 04:02:17,079
before they hung him from the gallows

2790
04:02:17,079 --> 04:02:19,079
these were the final words he said

2791
04:02:19,079 --> 04:02:21,079
my fortune is yours for the ta-

2792
04:02:21,079 --> 04:02:22,079
come true

2793
04:02:22,079 --> 04:02:23,079
since pirates

2794
04:02:23,079 --> 04:02:25,450
have been a grand lot

2795
04:02:25,450 --> 04:02:26,450
searching for one piece

2796
04:02:26,450 --> 04:02:29,450
the treasure that would make their dreams come true

2797
04:02:29,450 --> 04:02:30,450
yeah

2798
04:02:30,450 --> 04:02:32,709
now you're just dreaming

2799
04:02:32,709 --> 04:02:33,709
don't give it up

2800
04:02:33,709 --> 04:02:34,709
blue face

2801
04:02:34,709 --> 04:02:35,709
no

2802
04:02:35,709 --> 04:02:36,709
give it up

2803
04:02:36,709 --> 04:02:37,709
dream it

2804
04:02:37,709 --> 04:02:38,709
don't give it up

2805
04:02:38,709 --> 04:02:39,709
dream it

2806
04:02:39,709 --> 04:02:43,829
don't give it

2807
04:02:43,829 --> 04:02:44,829
no

2808
04:02:44,829 --> 04:02:45,829
that's not even

2809
04:02:45,829 --> 04:02:46,829
come on

2810
04:02:46,829 --> 04:02:47,829
if that went to court

2811
04:02:47,829 --> 04:02:48,829
I wouldn't fucking lose

2812
04:02:48,829 --> 04:02:49,829
okay

2813
04:02:49,829 --> 04:02:50,829
I would win that case

2814
04:02:50,829 --> 04:02:51,829
here's how the story goes

2815
04:02:51,829 --> 04:02:52,829
we find out

2816
04:02:52,829 --> 04:02:53,829
by the treasure in the grand lot

2817
04:02:53,829 --> 04:02:54,829
there's no doubt

2818
04:02:54,829 --> 04:02:55,829
the pirate whose eye

2819
04:02:55,829 --> 04:02:56,829
is on it

2820
04:02:56,829 --> 04:02:57,829
he'll sing

2821
04:02:57,829 --> 04:02:58,829
I'll be king of the pirates

2822
04:02:58,829 --> 04:02:59,829
I'm good at everything

2823
04:02:59,829 --> 04:03:00,829
all right

2824
04:03:00,829 --> 04:03:02,520
and I

2825
04:03:02,520 --> 04:03:03,520
I ain't losing cell phone

2826
04:03:03,520 --> 04:03:04,520
woman up

2827
04:03:04,520 --> 04:03:05,520
dreaming

2828
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:06,520
don't give it up

2829
04:03:06,520 --> 04:03:07,520
blue face

2830
04:03:07,520 --> 04:03:08,520
dream it

2831
04:03:08,520 --> 04:03:12,000
So long, don't give it up now, baby.

2832
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:16,829
Don't give it up, don't give it up, don't give it up.

2833
04:03:16,829 --> 04:03:17,670
Throw it out.

2834
04:03:17,670 --> 04:03:18,430
Throw that out of court.

2835
04:03:18,430 --> 04:03:24,620
Doesn't belong here.

2836
04:03:24,620 --> 04:03:35,049
GoldenEye faculty music?

2837
04:03:35,049 --> 04:03:46,159
What the fuck are you talking about?

2838
04:03:46,159 --> 04:04:08,420
This way to rat, this way to rat, this way to rat,

2839
04:04:08,420 --> 04:04:12,420
this way to rat, this way to rat.

2840
04:04:12,420 --> 04:04:29,340
That's perfect to go by.

2841
04:04:29,340 --> 04:04:31,860
How would you even fucking think about that?

2842
04:04:31,860 --> 04:04:34,219
I have no idea.

2843
04:04:34,219 --> 04:04:37,729
All right, let's go back to the puzzle.

2844
04:04:37,729 --> 04:04:41,430
Let's finish what we were doing here.

2845
04:04:41,430 --> 04:04:43,069
And then I'm probably gonna call it.

2846
04:04:43,149 --> 04:04:45,979
And we'll do VR tomorrow.

2847
04:04:45,979 --> 04:04:47,299
Back into the headset.

2848
04:04:47,299 --> 04:04:48,299
I feel pretty good.

2849
04:04:48,299 --> 04:04:57,600
I'll be good to go.

2850
04:04:57,600 --> 04:04:59,319
Holy shit, this was a puzzle stream.

2851
04:04:59,319 --> 04:05:01,930
Yeah, it was.

2852
04:05:01,930 --> 04:05:04,659
Gonna finish, this is electronics.

2853
04:05:04,659 --> 04:05:05,659
Well, it's on the plate for VR.

2854
04:05:05,659 --> 04:05:18,379
I'm gonna do Minecraft VR just to get it out of the way.

2855
04:05:18,379 --> 04:05:20,600
And then after that, or maybe before that,

2856
04:05:20,600 --> 04:05:24,139
depending on how hard it is to set that up.

2857
04:05:24,139 --> 04:05:30,610
I do have at least three or four more VR games to play.

2858
04:05:30,610 --> 04:05:33,450
And then, so we had a stream yesterday,

2859
04:05:33,450 --> 04:05:35,110
stream today, stream tomorrow.

2860
04:05:35,110 --> 04:05:36,750
And then after tomorrow,

2861
04:05:36,750 --> 04:05:39,479
you're not gonna see me for a few days.

2862
04:05:39,479 --> 04:05:42,899
Taking a few days off in a row.

2863
04:05:42,899 --> 04:05:46,079
I've got some company that's coming up.

2864
04:05:46,079 --> 04:05:48,229
So I wanna spend some time with them.

2865
04:05:48,229 --> 04:05:49,309
So after tomorrow,

2866
04:05:49,309 --> 04:05:54,819
you will not see me until three days later.

2867
04:05:54,819 --> 04:05:58,040
Just wanna make sure you tell you no.

2868
04:05:58,040 --> 04:06:01,340
All right, finish this puzzle.

2869
04:06:01,340 --> 04:06:07,690
And then I'm gonna call it for the night.

2870
04:06:07,690 --> 04:06:13,579
I gotta clean this shit up, yeah, I know.

2871
04:06:13,579 --> 04:06:15,659
Fucking PictoPix again.

2872
04:06:15,659 --> 04:06:20,770
No, look, all right, I'm just gonna call it now.

2873
04:06:20,770 --> 04:06:22,770
I'm just gonna call it now.

2874
04:06:22,770 --> 04:06:23,969
That's the end of the stream.

2875
04:06:23,969 --> 04:06:28,959
Thanks for coming.

2876
04:06:28,959 --> 04:06:30,399
You know what, you guys do it.

2877
04:06:30,399 --> 04:06:33,370
You guys finish it up.

2878
04:06:33,370 --> 04:06:37,190
All right, let me finish this.

2879
04:06:37,190 --> 04:06:48,239
Self-conscious streamer, it can't get over it.

2880
04:06:48,239 --> 04:06:54,250
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

2881
04:06:54,250 --> 04:07:00,799
All right, six has to go up this way.

2882
04:07:00,799 --> 04:07:03,420
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2883
04:07:03,420 --> 04:07:05,819
Let's just say it's probably up here.

2884
04:07:05,819 --> 04:07:07,780
Has to be at least one of those.

2885
04:07:07,780 --> 04:07:12,200
There's three.

2886
04:07:12,200 --> 04:07:13,559
Am I gonna play Devil May Cry for Sekiro?

2887
04:07:13,559 --> 04:07:17,020
I'm gonna play Sekiro day one.

2888
04:07:17,020 --> 04:07:21,049
So the day that Sekiro launches, I will be streaming it.

2889
04:07:21,049 --> 04:07:23,309
I'm going to enjoy that game.

2890
04:07:23,309 --> 04:07:25,290
I'm gonna play very, very patiently.

2891
04:07:25,290 --> 04:07:27,129
I'm gonna just love the fuck out of it.

2892
04:07:27,129 --> 04:07:30,700
So when is the gamer duel with Joel?

2893
04:07:30,700 --> 04:07:32,370
That's a good question.

2894
04:07:32,370 --> 04:07:35,889
Joel and I just recently became Discord friends.

2895
04:07:35,889 --> 04:07:37,270
So probably not,

2896
04:07:37,270 --> 04:07:38,209
probably that's probably not gonna happen

2897
04:07:38,409 --> 04:07:44,600
until after I get back from seeing friends.

2898
04:07:44,600 --> 04:07:45,819
We'll see.

2899
04:07:45,819 --> 04:07:47,959
Anywho, how are we doing here?

2900
04:07:47,959 --> 04:07:51,059
One, two, three, one, two, three.

2901
04:07:51,059 --> 04:07:52,100
Don't have enough info for this,

2902
04:07:52,100 --> 04:07:55,959
but we do have enough info to go here.

2903
04:07:55,959 --> 04:08:01,750
Cause that's that.

2904
04:08:01,750 --> 04:08:10,149
After all this time, you know?

2905
04:08:10,149 --> 04:08:13,780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2906
04:08:13,780 --> 04:08:17,270
I just don't know which way.

2907
04:08:17,270 --> 04:08:22,129
One, one, one.

2908
04:08:22,129 --> 04:08:24,690
Is Discord friends marriage?

2909
04:08:24,690 --> 04:08:26,270
I don't think so.

2910
04:08:26,270 --> 04:08:31,059
I would say no.

2911
04:08:31,059 --> 04:08:40,360
What about down here?

2912
04:08:40,360 --> 04:08:45,860
I don't have enough info to fill that in.

2913
04:08:45,860 --> 04:08:46,739
It's three and three,

2914
04:08:46,739 --> 04:08:48,139
but it's don't have enough info.

2915
04:08:48,139 --> 04:08:49,200
I need more up here,

2916
04:08:49,200 --> 04:08:51,860
but how the fuck am I gonna get that?

2917
04:08:51,860 --> 04:08:56,629
I need to cancel some shit out up here.

2918
04:08:56,629 --> 04:08:59,549
I could do this,

2919
04:08:59,549 --> 04:09:00,989
which then lets me do that.

2920
04:09:00,989 --> 04:09:03,620
All right, keep going.

2921
04:09:03,620 --> 04:09:13,680
So it's pretty much mirrored until down here.

2922
04:09:13,680 --> 04:09:27,829
Six, um, damn, one, one.

2923
04:09:27,829 --> 04:09:28,909
I would say right here,

2924
04:09:28,909 --> 04:09:30,989
but it could be here too.

2925
04:09:30,989 --> 04:09:32,270
No, no, it couldn't.

2926
04:09:32,270 --> 04:09:34,219
No, it couldn't.

2927
04:09:34,219 --> 04:09:41,729
No, it could not.

2928
04:09:41,729 --> 04:09:43,649
Let's go with, this is done now.

2929
04:09:43,649 --> 04:09:47,579
All right, that's enough info.

2930
04:09:47,579 --> 04:09:53,620
Let's go.

2931
04:09:53,620 --> 04:09:54,760
That's three.

2932
04:09:54,760 --> 04:09:55,579
Perfect.

2933
04:09:55,579 --> 04:09:58,829
Three again.

2934
04:09:58,829 --> 04:09:59,989
All right.

2935
04:09:59,989 --> 04:10:00,989
Getting there.

2936
04:10:00,989 --> 04:10:04,500
Another three.

2937
04:10:04,500 --> 04:10:08,530
This is the six.

2938
04:10:08,530 --> 04:10:09,370
Perfect.

2939
04:10:09,370 --> 04:10:13,760
Five is gonna be right in the middle here.

2940
04:10:13,760 --> 04:10:22,040
Ooh, feels good.

2941
04:10:22,040 --> 04:10:26,090
Two, one, one, one, one.

2942
04:10:26,090 --> 04:10:28,700
There's eight.

2943
04:10:28,700 --> 04:10:32,940
Almost done.

2944
04:10:32,940 --> 04:10:39,159
Cool.

2945
04:10:39,159 --> 04:10:41,870
Two.

2946
04:10:41,870 --> 04:10:43,620
Yes.

2947
04:10:43,620 --> 04:10:44,459
Gotta be here.

2948
04:10:44,459 --> 04:10:45,280
Gotta be here.

2949
04:10:45,280 --> 04:10:46,120
Close it.

2950
04:10:46,120 --> 04:10:48,040
Close it.

2951
04:10:48,040 --> 04:10:49,659
There are four.

2952
04:10:49,659 --> 04:10:53,729
Hmm.

2953
04:10:53,729 --> 04:11:02,340
Has to be right here.

2954
04:11:02,340 --> 04:11:03,500
This is kind of freaking me out though.

2955
04:11:03,500 --> 04:11:04,579
So it's gonna be back this way.

2956
04:11:04,579 --> 04:11:07,100
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2957
04:11:07,100 --> 04:11:11,030
Maybe not.

2958
04:11:11,030 --> 04:11:19,379
Okay, so two, two.

2959
04:11:19,379 --> 04:11:21,469
Nice.

2960
04:11:21,469 --> 04:11:24,530
Almost done.

2961
04:11:24,530 --> 04:11:33,799
This is all filled in except the top rows here.

2962
04:11:33,799 --> 04:11:34,639
Hmm.

2963
04:11:34,639 --> 04:11:40,620
Interesting.

2964
04:11:40,620 --> 04:11:43,680
What is it?

2965
04:11:43,680 --> 04:11:45,840
CPU?

2966
04:11:45,840 --> 04:11:46,680
Chip?

2967
04:11:46,680 --> 04:11:49,180
Microchip.

2968
04:11:49,180 --> 04:11:52,340
Good work everybody.

2969
04:11:52,340 --> 04:11:53,180
And that's it.

2970
04:11:53,180 --> 04:11:54,889
I'm gonna call it here.

2971
04:11:54,889 --> 04:11:58,030
Thanks for watching this absolute mess

2972
04:11:58,030 --> 04:12:01,629
of a fucking live stream.

2973
04:12:01,629 --> 04:12:05,639
This is the third game.

2974
04:12:05,639 --> 04:12:08,479
Had some technical issues with the first one.

2975
04:12:08,479 --> 04:12:10,959
Second one was all right.

2976
04:12:10,959 --> 04:12:11,799
It was good.

2977
04:12:11,799 --> 04:12:14,860
I have nothing really bad to say about the second one

2978
04:12:14,860 --> 04:12:17,479
except for the fact that I'd rather just chill

2979
04:12:17,479 --> 04:12:22,100
and play Picross.

2980
04:12:22,100 --> 04:12:24,360
Tomorrow, VR.

2981
04:12:24,360 --> 04:12:27,459
We'll do a good four or five hours in VR tomorrow.

2982
04:12:28,079 --> 04:12:30,399
And then I'm gonna take the next few days off.

2983
04:12:30,399 --> 04:12:31,239
See you real soon.

2984
04:12:31,239 --> 04:12:32,920
Let's get to the bits and the subs.

2985
04:12:32,920 --> 04:12:35,280
Thank you guys for sticking around.

2986
04:12:35,280 --> 04:12:39,170
And again, sorry for a stream

2987
04:12:39,170 --> 04:12:40,610
that was all over the place.

2988
04:12:40,610 --> 04:12:43,510
Hope you still had fun.

2989
04:12:43,510 --> 04:12:48,440
Let's move on to the end.

2990
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:49,540
Let's go.

2991
04:12:49,540 --> 04:12:57,579
What do you say?

2992
04:12:57,579 --> 04:12:59,729
All right.

2993
04:12:59,729 --> 04:13:04,059
See you tomorrow if you're taking off.

2994
04:13:04,059 --> 04:13:05,819
If you're not taking off,

2995
04:13:05,819 --> 04:13:08,340
we have a little bit of this to get through.

2996
04:13:08,340 --> 04:13:14,870
A whole lot, not a million.

2997
04:13:14,870 --> 04:13:19,059
Get some shit open.

2998
04:13:19,059 --> 04:13:20,459
Came to the last hour, but I had fun.

2999
04:13:20,459 --> 04:13:21,379
I'm glad to hear that.

3000
04:13:21,379 --> 04:13:23,219
Good.

3001
04:13:23,219 --> 04:13:24,059
What?

3002
04:13:24,059 --> 04:13:25,979
I think I'm about to close my Twitch window

3003
04:13:25,979 --> 04:13:28,020
when I had Audacity open somehow.

3004
04:13:35,690 --> 04:13:37,610
Let's open it back up, please.

3005
04:13:47,639 --> 04:13:51,469
Okay.

3006
04:13:51,469 --> 04:13:55,030
Cool, cool, cool.

3007
04:13:55,030 --> 04:13:56,870
So let's go back.

3008
04:13:56,870 --> 04:14:02,069
Earlier, about seven-ish hours ago,

3009
04:14:02,069 --> 04:14:08,780
we had a 250 from Lazy Luke.

3010
04:14:08,780 --> 04:14:12,079
No, this is yesterday.

3011
04:14:12,079 --> 04:14:13,670
Sorry.

3012
04:14:13,670 --> 04:14:14,489
I'm stupid.

3013
04:14:14,950 --> 04:14:15,790
Here we go.

3014
04:14:15,790 --> 04:14:18,079
Sad Vega, thanks for the three bucks.

3015
04:14:18,079 --> 04:14:21,659
Appreciate it.

3016
04:14:21,659 --> 04:14:23,459
Space Jenify part one, baby.

3017
04:14:23,459 --> 04:14:25,500
Woo, what a blast.

3018
04:14:25,500 --> 04:14:28,139
I'm making cheesy goji to Crunch Tacos homemade

3019
04:14:28,139 --> 04:14:29,540
and boy, they're good.

3020
04:14:29,540 --> 04:14:32,780
Also, did you up the cost of three to be read out loud

3021
04:14:32,780 --> 04:14:34,459
and we still doing the ones?

3022
04:14:34,459 --> 04:14:35,420
Very curious to know.

3023
04:14:35,420 --> 04:14:37,059
250.

3024
04:14:37,059 --> 04:14:39,020
I'm sorry that you were so excited for Space Jenify.

3025
04:14:39,020 --> 04:14:40,879
I was too.

3026
04:14:40,879 --> 04:14:41,959
Maybe I was doing something wrong.

3027
04:14:41,959 --> 04:14:43,120
I don't think I was though.

3028
04:14:43,120 --> 04:14:46,649
Something was going, something was wacky.

3029
04:14:46,649 --> 04:14:49,170
250 is the minimum for me to read.

3030
04:14:50,129 --> 04:14:52,649
And again, I wanna make sure I reiterate this too.

3031
04:14:55,290 --> 04:14:59,489
Just because you give 250 doesn't mean I'm going to read.

3032
04:14:59,489 --> 04:15:00,850
Obviously something that I still have to be

3033
04:15:00,850 --> 04:15:02,409
comfortable reading.

3034
04:15:02,409 --> 04:15:03,969
Maybe it's something that I don't really wanna address

3035
04:15:03,969 --> 04:15:07,979
or talk about, I may not address it.

3036
04:15:07,979 --> 04:15:09,540
And a lot of times, sometimes people even put

3037
04:15:09,540 --> 04:15:13,299
in their messages to not say these things.

3038
04:15:13,299 --> 04:15:17,930
So fair enough, fair enough, right.

3039
04:15:17,930 --> 04:15:18,889
But it's 250.

3040
04:15:21,159 --> 04:15:24,659
But again, it is also at my discretion.

3041
04:15:25,540 --> 04:15:26,379
He didn't answer if he ate ass.

3042
04:15:26,379 --> 04:15:31,059
I already did, I did.

3043
04:15:31,059 --> 04:15:33,860
But anyways, sad Vega.

3044
04:15:33,860 --> 04:15:34,700
Glad you're feeling better.

3045
04:15:34,700 --> 04:15:38,700
Also, whatever happened to Dr. A, Dr. Agon's,

3046
04:15:38,700 --> 04:15:40,299
Dragon's Dogma.

3047
04:15:40,299 --> 04:15:42,139
I was gonna try and play alongside you.

3048
04:15:42,139 --> 04:15:45,340
So you could have some pawns not named Poopypants

3049
04:15:45,340 --> 04:15:47,489
or awful things.

3050
04:15:47,489 --> 04:15:49,290
Hope we get back to that sometime soon.

3051
04:15:49,290 --> 04:15:54,420
Isn't the creator interested in making a new one?

3052
04:15:54,420 --> 04:15:58,790
I should have just played that today.

3053
04:15:58,790 --> 04:16:01,790
Well, I mean, P-Cross is just on the mind.

3054
04:16:01,790 --> 04:16:05,540
I probably should have just opened that today.

3055
04:16:05,540 --> 04:16:08,389
That would have been like a perfect opportunity.

3056
04:16:08,389 --> 04:16:11,100
Oops, oh well.

3057
04:16:11,100 --> 04:16:14,340
It's coming out on Switch, that's amazing.

3058
04:16:14,340 --> 04:16:15,700
But after Devil May Cry 5,

3059
04:16:15,700 --> 04:16:20,319
you're gonna make another one, right?

3060
04:16:20,319 --> 04:16:21,239
But thank you, sad Vega.

3061
04:16:21,239 --> 04:16:22,879
Thank you, Pro Star for the five bucks

3062
04:16:22,879 --> 04:16:26,239
with the John Halo Master Chief Collection coming to PC.

3063
04:16:26,239 --> 04:16:30,020
Do you think you'll play those games on Steam?

3064
04:16:30,020 --> 04:16:32,719
I'm gonna say no.

3065
04:16:32,719 --> 04:16:34,559
I don't think so.

3066
04:16:34,559 --> 04:16:36,479
Unless like people really wanna see that,

3067
04:16:36,479 --> 04:16:39,159
would you guys really wanna see me play Halo 1

3068
04:16:39,159 --> 04:16:40,000
on stream?

3069
04:16:41,129 --> 04:16:42,729
The story mode?

3070
04:16:42,729 --> 04:16:51,790
Is that something that people would wanna watch?

3071
04:16:51,790 --> 04:16:55,459
I feel like the Halo games are,

3072
04:16:55,459 --> 04:16:58,700
you know, just kind of shooters with the story.

3073
04:17:01,690 --> 04:17:05,770
I don't know if it's something I'd wanna stream.

3074
04:17:05,770 --> 04:17:09,229
They're great games, but just kind of a story shooter.

3075
04:17:12,180 --> 04:17:16,590
The multiplayer, are they turning on the multiplayer?

3076
04:17:16,590 --> 04:17:22,180
Like will Halo 2 be online on Steam?

3077
04:17:22,180 --> 04:17:23,219
Well, that's a big deal.

3078
04:17:23,219 --> 04:17:24,940
Okay, that's a big, I didn't know that they,

3079
04:17:24,940 --> 04:17:26,059
I thought maybe they were just gonna turn

3080
04:17:26,059 --> 04:17:30,090
the servers off or something.

3081
04:17:30,090 --> 04:17:32,409
I just, it's just the, oh, okay, that's it.

3082
04:17:32,409 --> 04:17:35,389
I might even just play the multiplayer for fun.

3083
04:17:35,389 --> 04:17:37,670
Community maps too, holy shit, that's amazing.

3084
04:17:39,450 --> 04:17:44,069
That's a lot of money.

3085
04:17:44,069 --> 04:17:50,659
Dye335 just gave $200, two, holy shit.

3086
04:17:51,829 --> 04:17:54,969
He just gave 20,000 bits.

3087
04:17:54,969 --> 04:17:58,299
He just dropped a gigantic bit bomb.

3088
04:17:58,299 --> 04:17:59,420
200 bucks.

3089
04:18:01,049 --> 04:18:03,790
Thank you, first of all, Dye.

3090
04:18:03,790 --> 04:18:05,549
Been watching your videos since before.

3091
04:18:05,590 --> 04:18:07,549
Twitch back in 2011, honest to God,

3092
04:18:07,549 --> 04:18:12,020
best streamer I've ever watched, that's, thank you.

3093
04:18:17,229 --> 04:18:19,030
Anytime anybody says something like that,

3094
04:18:19,030 --> 04:18:20,629
I always wanna try to do better.

3095
04:18:25,500 --> 04:18:26,940
That means an absolute fuck ton.

3096
04:18:26,940 --> 04:18:29,020
Thank you so much for the $200, Dye.

3097
04:18:31,100 --> 04:18:33,459
So much more money as well tonight.

3098
04:18:33,459 --> 04:18:35,940
There was so much money from other people.

3099
04:18:37,870 --> 04:18:43,180
50, 50, 50, 20, 20, 20, 30, 15, 15, 30, 30.

3100
04:18:43,180 --> 04:18:54,649
Thank you guys all so much, for real.

3101
04:18:54,690 --> 04:18:56,049
That's a shit load of money.

3102
04:19:00,129 --> 04:19:04,829
I am spoiled rotten.

3103
04:19:04,829 --> 04:19:11,659
I'm glad you think this stream is worth paying for.

3104
04:19:11,659 --> 04:19:14,510
I'm gonna keep trying to do better.

3105
04:19:14,510 --> 04:19:17,430
Very important point.

3106
04:19:17,430 --> 04:19:18,829
Can always strive to do better,

3107
04:19:18,829 --> 04:19:21,190
to try more, to do more things.

3108
04:19:24,700 --> 04:19:28,680
So I appreciate it.

3109
04:19:28,680 --> 04:19:30,520
Jess, you got it, thanks for the 250.

3110
04:19:30,520 --> 04:19:33,280
I think this was summarized history,

3111
04:19:33,280 --> 04:19:35,399
but it sounds like slam poetry.

3112
04:19:35,399 --> 04:19:36,399
What is it?

3113
04:19:36,399 --> 04:19:37,840
Something that I said?

3114
04:19:37,879 --> 04:19:39,079
War bad.

3115
04:19:42,440 --> 04:19:44,120
Spice trading.

3116
04:19:44,120 --> 04:19:47,860
Trade sugar, tobacco trading.

3117
04:19:47,860 --> 04:19:49,700
Economies, collapses.

3118
04:19:52,979 --> 04:19:58,120
Entrepreneurship, industry, steam.

3119
04:19:58,120 --> 04:20:00,360
Am I playing the $100,000 pyramid?

3120
04:20:00,360 --> 04:20:01,479
Natural gas.

3121
04:20:01,479 --> 04:20:03,280
What are we, what's going on?

3122
04:20:03,280 --> 04:20:06,139
England?

3123
04:20:06,139 --> 04:20:08,110
England.

3124
04:20:08,110 --> 04:20:08,950
England.

3125
04:20:10,030 --> 04:20:10,870
America.

3126
04:20:10,870 --> 04:20:12,069
Slam poetry.

3127
04:20:12,069 --> 04:20:13,829
America.

3128
04:20:13,829 --> 04:20:15,700
America.

3129
04:20:15,819 --> 04:20:17,020
Oh, that's the C-Man.

3130
04:20:17,020 --> 04:20:18,260
The C-Man stream, right.

3131
04:20:18,260 --> 04:20:24,950
Okay, I remember.

3132
04:20:24,950 --> 04:20:26,549
That sounds like something my English teacher would do.

3133
04:20:26,549 --> 04:20:29,450
You sure we're not the same person?

3134
04:20:29,450 --> 04:20:33,629
Thank you, Jess, you got it for the 250, and the clip.

3135
04:20:33,629 --> 04:20:35,309
Hey, Kristen, thanks for the five bucks.

3136
04:20:35,309 --> 04:20:37,270
Left, right, choo-choo, hey, hey, hey.

3137
04:20:37,270 --> 04:20:41,629
Left, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

3138
04:20:41,629 --> 04:20:51,760
That's a pretty good summary of Space General 5 part one.

3139
04:20:51,760 --> 04:20:58,069
Thank you.

3140
04:20:58,069 --> 04:21:01,579
I'm sad that I couldn't really get that to go.

3141
04:21:01,579 --> 04:21:06,340
It was kind of futile.

3142
04:21:06,340 --> 04:21:08,059
I didn't want to give that game a bad name

3143
04:21:08,059 --> 04:21:10,500
because I love that series.

3144
04:21:10,500 --> 04:21:15,860
I just love that game.

3145
04:21:15,860 --> 04:21:21,049
It probably is the fact that I just didn't have a CRT.

3146
04:21:21,049 --> 04:21:22,530
On the bright side, the VR game you think

3147
04:21:22,530 --> 04:21:24,530
is a remake of part one.

3148
04:21:24,530 --> 04:21:26,569
Well, that actually, the cards all fall

3149
04:21:26,569 --> 04:21:28,840
in a perfect spot, if that's true.

3150
04:21:28,840 --> 04:21:30,780
So that's, we'll just play that.

3151
04:21:35,569 --> 04:21:36,409
Where are we?

3152
04:21:36,409 --> 04:21:38,469
I got lost here, there we are.

3153
04:21:38,469 --> 04:21:40,149
Hey, grapplemace, thanks for the 250.

3154
04:21:40,149 --> 04:21:42,870
Any chance of another stream like Picross?

3155
04:21:42,870 --> 04:21:44,510
I honestly loved it.

3156
04:21:44,510 --> 04:21:46,510
PS, where are the Pikachu socks?

3157
04:21:46,510 --> 04:21:49,110
We bought you for Christmas, BibleThump.

3158
04:21:49,110 --> 04:21:52,190
What a, grapplemace, that was six hours ago.

3159
04:21:52,190 --> 04:21:55,690
Any chance of another Picross stream?

3160
04:21:55,690 --> 04:21:59,399
Well, if you are still here, there you go.

3161
04:21:59,399 --> 04:22:03,159
If you're not here anymore and you might catch the Vod,

3162
04:22:03,159 --> 04:22:06,860
you're gonna be happy about that.

3163
04:22:06,860 --> 04:22:07,819
Thank you, though.

3164
04:22:07,819 --> 04:22:09,540
Thank you, Freudian Weapon.

3165
04:22:09,540 --> 04:22:11,659
I am here, thank you for Picross.

3166
04:22:11,659 --> 04:22:17,260
Thank you, grapplemace, for sticking around for that long.

3167
04:22:17,260 --> 04:22:19,510
Hope you liked the Picross.

3168
04:22:19,510 --> 04:22:22,229
And then Freudian Weapon of 250 from Freudian.

3169
04:22:22,229 --> 04:22:23,790
This game makes me want to dance.

3170
04:22:23,790 --> 04:22:26,500
I think the aliens are taking over my brain.

3171
04:22:26,659 --> 04:22:28,659
Nose wipe, yes.

3172
04:22:28,659 --> 04:22:30,649
They tend to do that.

3173
04:22:30,649 --> 04:22:37,420
They tend to do that.

3174
04:22:37,420 --> 04:22:40,799
We had, I'm getting, they moved.

3175
04:22:40,799 --> 04:22:43,000
We had a bunch of community subs tonight.

3176
04:22:43,000 --> 04:22:49,440
I think I missed some of them, too.

3177
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:50,879
Let me see.

3178
04:22:50,879 --> 04:22:53,239
The Lake Drinker had five community subs.

3179
04:22:57,489 --> 04:22:58,809
Epic gave five community subs.

3180
04:22:58,809 --> 04:23:01,350
Kazzy, five community subs.

3181
04:23:01,350 --> 04:23:05,959
Thank you, guys.

3182
04:23:05,959 --> 04:23:10,940
Also Castillion, or Castalion, gave 10 bucks.

3183
04:23:10,940 --> 04:23:12,420
Hey, Gerber, sending my love from New Zealand.

3184
04:23:12,420 --> 04:23:14,340
It's been rough here, given what's happened.

3185
04:23:14,340 --> 04:23:15,299
But I just want to tell everyone

3186
04:23:15,299 --> 04:23:17,780
that they're good people and a great community.

3187
04:23:17,780 --> 04:23:21,889
Regards, a Kiwi fan.

3188
04:23:21,889 --> 04:23:25,620
That's absolutely fucking terrible what happened.

3189
04:23:25,620 --> 04:23:28,340
Actually, last night I was just kind of reading up on it.

3190
04:23:28,340 --> 04:23:40,600
And it's just fucking terrible.

3191
04:23:40,600 --> 04:23:45,079
Yeah, this shit is absolutely heartbreaking.

3192
04:23:45,079 --> 04:23:48,000
It's one of those scenarios where you just wish

3193
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:50,270
that shit wasn't real.

3194
04:23:50,270 --> 04:23:53,340
Just sitting there in bed last night,

3195
04:23:53,340 --> 04:23:54,860
just going over, reading on my iPad,

3196
04:23:54,860 --> 04:23:56,940
different things, and just seeing what happened.

3197
04:23:56,979 --> 04:24:01,500
Because last night it was, somebody mentioned it.

3198
04:24:01,500 --> 04:24:02,459
I didn't even know what happened.

3199
04:24:02,459 --> 04:24:07,299
And then just, you're lying down,

3200
04:24:07,299 --> 04:24:08,459
you're just sitting there staring at the ceiling,

3201
04:24:08,459 --> 04:24:14,780
just going like, why the fuck is this shit real?

3202
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:22,159
Absolutely fucking horrible tragedy.

3203
04:24:22,159 --> 04:24:27,610
But thank you so much, Castillion.

3204
04:24:27,610 --> 04:24:29,370
Thank you for 10 dollars.

3205
04:24:29,370 --> 04:24:42,930
And stay safe.

3206
04:24:42,930 --> 04:24:44,010
And you read more about it today.

3207
04:24:44,010 --> 04:24:47,750
That's why it's just, it's so,

3208
04:24:47,750 --> 04:24:53,360
it's just such an awful fucking feeling.

3209
04:24:53,399 --> 04:24:56,159
I just wish people were fucking better to each other.

3210
04:24:56,159 --> 04:25:00,420
Really.

3211
04:25:00,420 --> 04:25:10,229
It's awful, awful shit.

3212
04:25:10,229 --> 04:25:20,139
But regardless, we're gonna move on from that.

3213
04:25:20,139 --> 04:25:22,940
Thank you again, Castillion, and again.

3214
04:25:22,940 --> 04:25:24,100
Stay safe, all of you.

3215
04:25:24,100 --> 04:25:31,840
That goes for everybody.

3216
04:25:31,840 --> 04:25:33,280
And right after that, there was,

3217
04:25:33,280 --> 04:25:36,459
there was 150 dollars thrown in here

3218
04:25:36,459 --> 04:25:38,659
from something or other, Juno, SEPTO,

3219
04:25:38,659 --> 04:25:42,200
something or other, they gave 100 bucks.

3220
04:25:42,200 --> 04:25:46,440
Just dropping, just huge stacks of money on this stream.

3221
04:25:47,000 --> 04:25:49,959
It's, thank you, guys.

3222
04:25:49,959 --> 04:25:50,959
Thank you, thank you, thank you

3223
04:25:50,959 --> 04:25:56,379
from the bottom of my fucking heart.

3224
04:25:56,379 --> 04:25:59,120
That's a lot of money.

3225
04:25:59,120 --> 04:26:00,959
And La Cranda, 100 bucks.

3226
04:26:00,959 --> 04:26:03,280
I just forgot how much money was back here.

3227
04:26:03,280 --> 04:26:04,280
La Cranda, 100 bucks.

3228
04:26:04,280 --> 04:26:07,319
Smashly, 50 bucks.

3229
04:26:07,319 --> 04:26:19,000
Jesus.

3230
04:26:19,000 --> 04:26:21,200
You guys are, you guys are too much.

3231
04:26:21,200 --> 04:26:27,110
Really.

3232
04:26:27,110 --> 04:26:27,950
Hydrate.

3233
04:26:29,149 --> 04:26:30,590
I'm good, I got one here.

3234
04:26:30,590 --> 04:26:33,510
When the stream's over, I'll go get something to drink.

3235
04:26:33,510 --> 04:26:34,350
To drink.

3236
04:26:37,100 --> 04:26:39,780
100's not 100 bucks, but any amount of money

3237
04:26:40,739 --> 04:26:41,579
that somebody gives the stream is appreciated.

3238
04:26:41,579 --> 04:26:42,940
I wanna make that really clear.

3239
04:26:42,940 --> 04:26:45,500
I know that some people say, no, 250.

3240
04:26:45,500 --> 04:26:48,219
Oh, that's, he's increasing the bids.

3241
04:26:48,219 --> 04:26:49,059
What if he does it again?

3242
04:26:49,059 --> 04:26:50,219
What if he does it again?

3243
04:26:50,219 --> 04:26:56,379
If you give a cent, it's wildly appreciated.

3244
04:26:56,379 --> 04:26:58,340
I don't want it to be one of those goal posts

3245
04:26:58,340 --> 04:26:59,979
that I keep moving like, yeah, come on out here.

3246
04:26:59,979 --> 04:27:03,780
You wanna say something, that'll be fucking 10 bucks.

3247
04:27:03,780 --> 04:27:04,620
That's not the intention.

3248
04:27:04,620 --> 04:27:05,459
That's not why I'm doing it.

3249
04:27:05,459 --> 04:27:08,350
That's not why I did it.

3250
04:27:08,350 --> 04:27:09,690
You can't give a cent.

3251
04:27:09,690 --> 04:27:12,729
Right, oh yeah, that is because if one cent,

3252
04:27:12,729 --> 04:27:14,450
yeah, all right, hold on.

3253
04:27:14,450 --> 04:27:17,610
If you have one cent on bids,

3254
04:27:17,610 --> 04:27:19,569
somebody can put a quarter down

3255
04:27:19,569 --> 04:27:23,180
and just spam the chat with one cent donations.

3256
04:27:23,180 --> 04:27:29,819
So that's why it's 25 cent minimum.

3257
04:27:29,819 --> 04:27:33,180
If like 50 people bought a dollar

3258
04:27:33,180 --> 04:27:37,309
and then all of them just spammed one cent cheers,

3259
04:27:37,309 --> 04:27:44,329
it would just be like, it would just be a mess.

3260
04:27:44,329 --> 04:27:47,129
But he appreciates every one of those 25 cents.

3261
04:27:47,129 --> 04:27:49,250
That's right, if you give one cent,

3262
04:27:49,250 --> 04:27:57,860
doesn't even know his own rules, but thank you.

3263
04:27:57,899 --> 04:28:02,069
I've seen it happen, it's not pretty.

3264
04:28:02,069 --> 04:28:05,129
Yes, that's true.

3265
04:28:05,129 --> 04:28:07,209
We got Alf the librarian, thanks with 250.

3266
04:28:07,209 --> 04:28:08,969
So I couldn't find a book

3267
04:28:08,969 --> 04:28:10,450
because one of the richest men in the world

3268
04:28:10,450 --> 04:28:12,620
already bought 50 copies.

3269
04:28:12,620 --> 04:28:15,100
But do you want a history of the Dreamcast book?

3270
04:28:15,100 --> 04:28:19,340
I already got one right here.

3271
04:28:19,340 --> 04:28:24,020
It's the manual, it's everything I need to know.

3272
04:28:24,020 --> 04:28:25,899
If you give him one cent, he tells you to fuck off.

3273
04:28:25,899 --> 04:28:28,750
Oh, I don't.

3274
04:28:28,750 --> 04:28:29,909
Hey, thank you, Bebraham.

3275
04:28:29,909 --> 04:28:32,299
You gave 10 community subs earlier.

3276
04:28:32,299 --> 04:28:36,579
Thank you.

3277
04:28:36,579 --> 04:28:42,370
Another $50, I forgot how much fucking, oh my Jesus.

3278
04:28:45,819 --> 04:28:51,020
Natikins gave 50, a hundred, right?

3279
04:28:51,020 --> 04:28:52,940
How many, a hundred bucks, how many?

3280
04:28:52,940 --> 04:29:04,299
My God, a hundred bucks.

3281
04:29:04,299 --> 04:29:06,809
Jesus.

3282
04:29:06,809 --> 04:29:09,409
Thank you Tiss Chaboy for the 10 bucks.

3283
04:29:09,409 --> 04:29:10,530
Jerma, you're my favorite streamer.

3284
04:29:10,530 --> 04:29:12,889
I've never left a streamer video without laughing.

3285
04:29:12,889 --> 04:29:13,969
My ass off.

3286
04:29:13,969 --> 04:29:14,889
Been watching for years.

3287
04:29:14,889 --> 04:29:15,969
I'm sorry this isn't much,

3288
04:29:15,969 --> 04:29:18,290
but it's the amount I can afford.

3289
04:29:18,290 --> 04:29:24,290
Love you, Jerma Jerma Hart.

3290
04:29:24,290 --> 04:29:29,569
I've said it before, just you being here is enough.

3291
04:29:29,569 --> 04:29:32,540
Now this, I don't have this without you watching.

3292
04:29:32,579 --> 04:29:39,620
So you guys are way more important.

3293
04:29:39,620 --> 04:29:42,260
Money is not as important as you hanging out

3294
04:29:42,260 --> 04:29:47,260
and having a good time and enjoying this shit.

3295
04:29:51,959 --> 04:29:54,379
Thank you.

3296
04:29:54,379 --> 04:29:55,979
Somebody said about the socks.

3297
04:29:55,979 --> 04:30:00,360
Yeah, they got lost in the mill.

3298
04:30:00,360 --> 04:30:07,790
I can't even, I can't say that anymore.

3299
04:30:07,790 --> 04:30:09,110
I'll tell you the truth.

3300
04:30:09,110 --> 04:30:17,450
Jerma the liar, somebody stole them, bought them.

3301
04:30:17,450 --> 04:30:21,969
They got sent to the door and somebody spiked them.

3302
04:30:23,059 --> 04:30:25,659
Yeah, it's fucked up.

3303
04:30:25,659 --> 04:30:35,659
I don't know, somebody stole them from me.

3304
04:30:35,659 --> 04:30:40,059
Oh, that's fucked up.

3305
04:30:40,059 --> 04:30:44,319
You want me to make another video?

3306
04:30:44,319 --> 04:30:46,719
I just like, every time I go to like buy them,

3307
04:30:46,719 --> 04:30:48,920
something comes up, like I hear like a fire alarm

3308
04:30:48,920 --> 04:30:49,760
goes off, right?

3309
04:30:49,760 --> 04:30:51,680
When I get, I'm hovering over purchase

3310
04:30:51,680 --> 04:30:54,360
and it's just, I gotta get out of here.

3311
04:30:54,360 --> 04:30:55,760
The fire alarm's going off.

3312
04:30:55,760 --> 04:31:01,680
It happens every time.

3313
04:31:01,680 --> 04:31:02,879
You want me to buy you a new pair?

3314
04:31:02,879 --> 04:31:04,079
No, this way.

3315
04:31:04,079 --> 04:31:08,520
I got a plan for that by the way.

3316
04:31:08,520 --> 04:31:11,040
That says I'm doing a bit voice.

3317
04:31:11,040 --> 04:31:13,000
That's the problem when you broadcast yourself

3318
04:31:13,000 --> 04:31:17,139
and record yourself hundreds of trillions of times.

3319
04:31:17,139 --> 04:31:19,540
That I can't sneak anything.

3320
04:31:19,540 --> 04:31:21,020
Oh, I wonder if what he's saying is true.

3321
04:31:21,020 --> 04:31:22,700
You've heard every cadence.

3322
04:31:22,700 --> 04:31:24,819
You've heard every one of my mannerisms.

3323
04:31:24,819 --> 04:31:27,979
I can't pretend, I can't lie to anybody here.

3324
04:31:27,979 --> 04:31:34,409
Even if I wanted to, it'd be impossible.

3325
04:31:34,409 --> 04:31:37,430
Sue, what the hell, what are you linking here?

3326
04:31:37,430 --> 04:31:41,799
What is this?

3327
04:31:41,799 --> 04:31:43,319
Jerma985 revelation.

3328
04:31:43,319 --> 04:31:50,260
Oh no, this, oh yeah, we watched that.

3329
04:31:50,260 --> 04:31:54,569
You go to get expanded, but it's all good.

3330
04:31:54,569 --> 04:31:59,219
I got a plan for those socks and the whale.

3331
04:31:59,219 --> 04:32:01,219
But thank you, Tissueboy.

3332
04:32:01,219 --> 04:32:05,040
Thank you, Dorkcube for the 250.

3333
04:32:05,040 --> 04:32:09,579
Thank you.

3334
04:32:09,579 --> 04:32:15,959
You say, I can't give you 50 dollars like these other guys.

3335
04:32:15,959 --> 04:32:17,840
I should feel bad about that, right?

3336
04:32:17,840 --> 04:32:23,159
That I can't give you more money.

3337
04:32:23,159 --> 04:32:30,219
Yet you're, I know you're baiting me here.

3338
04:32:30,219 --> 04:32:31,100
I'm not gonna take the bait,

3339
04:32:31,100 --> 04:32:32,620
but I'm gonna tell you thanks for the 250

3340
04:32:32,620 --> 04:32:41,459
and you don't have to give 50 dollars.

3341
04:32:41,459 --> 04:32:42,620
Speaking of 50 dollars, thank you,

3342
04:32:42,620 --> 04:32:47,510
Communist Taco for the 50 dollars.

3343
04:32:47,510 --> 04:32:49,229
Maybe I will try the PlayStation 2 version

3344
04:32:49,270 --> 04:32:50,110
or I'll just wait for the VR.

3345
04:32:50,110 --> 04:32:58,020
The VR one's coming out soon, right?

3346
04:32:58,020 --> 04:33:02,020
I feel like the VR one will just be better anyways.

3347
04:33:02,020 --> 04:33:07,500
Something or other thanks to the 250, you like pickles.

3348
04:33:07,500 --> 04:33:09,689
Yeah, I do.

3349
04:33:09,689 --> 04:33:12,590
I like pickles, they taste good.

3350
04:33:12,590 --> 04:33:15,189
I don't like sweet pickles, I like dill pickles.

3351
04:33:15,189 --> 04:33:16,930
And they gotta be crunchy.

3352
04:33:16,930 --> 04:33:19,569
None of these slippery bin inside

3353
04:33:19,569 --> 04:33:21,529
of an old lady's mouth for 30 seconds

3354
04:33:21,529 --> 04:33:25,490
smeared out of their mouth and put into your sandwich.

3355
04:33:25,490 --> 04:33:30,720
No, I want like the crunch, the snap pickles.

3356
04:33:30,720 --> 04:33:31,560
The ones that have like,

3357
04:33:31,560 --> 04:33:36,279
not the ones that have water all over them.

3358
04:33:36,279 --> 04:33:39,729
Sweet pickles I don't like at all.

3359
04:33:39,729 --> 04:33:43,669
Was that a meme with Drake?

3360
04:33:43,669 --> 04:33:46,580
Sweet pickles like, no, no, no, no.

3361
04:33:46,580 --> 04:33:54,979
Dill pickles, that's the one, pointin', right?

3362
04:33:54,979 --> 04:34:00,450
That'll get like a thousand upvotes on Reddit somewhere.

3363
04:34:00,450 --> 04:34:02,490
It doesn't matter if it's like a bad reference.

3364
04:34:02,490 --> 04:34:06,500
That's a terrible shit, like dog shit post meme,

3365
04:34:06,500 --> 04:34:14,279
but it probably will get clicks.

3366
04:34:14,279 --> 04:34:16,000
Pickles need to be soaked to become pickles.

3367
04:34:16,000 --> 04:34:16,919
Yeah, but then you take them out of the jar

3368
04:34:16,919 --> 04:34:18,080
and you wrap them in paper towels

3369
04:34:18,080 --> 04:34:20,860
and you squeeze, squish, crush, squish, crush,

3370
04:34:20,860 --> 04:34:22,930
unwrap, and they're dry.

3371
04:34:22,930 --> 04:34:24,090
Sure they might have a couple of hairs on them,

3372
04:34:24,090 --> 04:34:27,259
but you know you eat three inches of ass

3373
04:34:27,259 --> 04:34:31,490
every year anyways from meals.

3374
04:34:31,490 --> 04:34:35,650
Thank you, rise, fall of Ziggy Stardust for the 10 bucks.

3375
04:34:35,650 --> 04:34:37,810
Here's 10 great British pence.

3376
04:34:37,810 --> 04:34:39,889
In return I ask, do you eat ass?

3377
04:34:39,889 --> 04:34:48,380
Oh, pretty good timing on me reading this,

3378
04:34:48,380 --> 04:34:50,659
but thank you for the 10 bucks.

3379
04:34:50,659 --> 04:34:57,340
I've answered it already.

3380
04:34:57,340 --> 04:34:58,779
Thank you, Tishyboy for the $5.

3381
04:34:58,779 --> 04:34:59,979
Can you check the subs you missed?

3382
04:34:59,979 --> 04:35:03,540
Those people deserve acknowledgement for their bravery.

3383
04:35:03,540 --> 04:35:05,939
Yeah, well, if you're new,

3384
04:35:05,939 --> 04:35:09,889
I run a sub credits at the end of the stream.

3385
04:35:09,889 --> 04:35:12,209
Shows everybody's name on stream, on screen,

3386
04:35:12,209 --> 04:35:14,470
that sub during the stream.

3387
04:35:14,470 --> 04:35:22,020
I've found it's a very, it's a good system it seems,

3388
04:35:22,020 --> 04:35:27,229
but thank you for the $5, Tishyboy, appreciate it.

3389
04:35:27,229 --> 04:35:28,389
Pigeon, thanks for the 250.

3390
04:35:28,389 --> 04:35:29,790
I'm happy to report that my profile

3391
04:35:29,790 --> 04:35:31,349
on this community has received an A.

3392
04:35:31,349 --> 04:35:33,650
You got a 94% on that paper.

3393
04:35:33,650 --> 04:35:38,380
The professor marked me off for no quotes from you.

3394
04:35:38,380 --> 04:35:40,779
Dad, I told you I had to use a quote.

3395
04:35:40,779 --> 04:35:41,619
What did I say?

3396
04:35:41,619 --> 04:35:42,459
Eat vegetables and shit?

3397
04:35:42,459 --> 04:35:45,490
You could have just put it in there.

3398
04:35:45,490 --> 04:35:47,049
You could have just put it at the very end.

3399
04:35:47,049 --> 04:35:50,090
By the way, and like leave like a hyperlink to a clip

3400
04:35:50,090 --> 04:35:51,569
of me saying, eat your vegetables,

3401
04:35:51,569 --> 04:35:53,380
like good luck on your paper.

3402
04:35:53,380 --> 04:35:59,740
And he would have been like, what the fuck?

3403
04:35:59,740 --> 04:36:04,729
Well, congrats on the paper.

3404
04:36:04,729 --> 04:36:06,849
94%, you should be proud of that.

3405
04:36:06,849 --> 04:36:15,500
That's a very good job.

3406
04:36:15,500 --> 04:36:17,419
Appreciate the 250.

3407
04:36:17,419 --> 04:36:19,500
And then we had the Cremator, thanks for three bucks.

3408
04:36:19,500 --> 04:36:20,459
You asked about games to play.

3409
04:36:20,459 --> 04:36:22,540
What about Grand Theft Auto 2?

3410
04:36:22,540 --> 04:36:25,900
It's free on Steam.

3411
04:36:25,900 --> 04:36:34,599
GTA 2 is free on Steam?

3412
04:36:34,599 --> 04:36:38,259
Is that true?

3413
04:36:38,259 --> 04:36:46,220
Am I getting baited or is that actually real?

3414
04:36:46,220 --> 04:36:47,840
Free?

3415
04:36:47,840 --> 04:36:52,630
I don't know.

3416
04:36:52,630 --> 04:36:55,919
It was free for some time now, really.

3417
04:36:55,919 --> 04:36:56,880
You can't buy it.

3418
04:36:56,880 --> 04:37:00,610
No, I don't know.

3419
04:37:00,610 --> 04:37:04,619
I'm really drunk.

3420
04:37:04,619 --> 04:37:07,939
Well, drink some water.

3421
04:37:07,939 --> 04:37:14,419
But thank you for the three bucks.

3422
04:37:14,419 --> 04:37:16,189
Appreciate it.

3423
04:37:16,189 --> 04:37:18,270
Rise and fall of Stardust.

3424
04:37:18,270 --> 04:37:19,189
Thanks for the $5.

3425
04:37:19,189 --> 04:37:21,830
I don't know what this is.

3426
04:37:21,830 --> 04:37:23,229
This looks like Morse code.

3427
04:37:26,709 --> 04:37:28,189
I don't know what this is,

3428
04:37:28,189 --> 04:37:29,470
but thank you for the $5

3429
04:37:29,470 --> 04:37:34,799
and thanks for the Morse code.

3430
04:37:34,799 --> 04:37:36,119
It's not Morse code though.

3431
04:37:36,159 --> 04:37:38,209
It's something else.

3432
04:37:38,209 --> 04:37:43,209
This actually might be the top portion of an ASCII art

3433
04:37:44,290 --> 04:37:45,689
that they maybe tried to put the whole thing in

3434
04:37:45,689 --> 04:37:46,970
and it just auto-deleted everything

3435
04:37:46,970 --> 04:37:48,130
because there's only a certain amount of characters

3436
04:37:48,130 --> 04:37:52,270
you can put through to Streamlabs.

3437
04:37:52,270 --> 04:37:54,970
Maybe.

3438
04:37:54,970 --> 04:37:55,889
I don't know.

3439
04:37:55,889 --> 04:37:57,490
It's hard to tell.

3440
04:37:57,490 --> 04:37:58,930
But thank you for the $5.

3441
04:38:02,220 --> 04:38:04,540
Thank you to three bucks Cremator again.

3442
04:38:06,909 --> 04:38:09,759
I don't know if I don't wanna take,

3443
04:38:09,759 --> 04:38:11,400
I'm not gonna click on that link.

3444
04:38:11,400 --> 04:38:12,959
I don't wanna see what happened to your hand.

3445
04:38:12,959 --> 04:38:20,060
Hopefully you're okay.

3446
04:38:20,099 --> 04:38:21,799
Hopefully you're all right.

3447
04:38:21,799 --> 04:38:26,180
Whatever happened to you.

3448
04:38:26,180 --> 04:38:28,540
Hey, thank you DeusMorte for the 250.

3449
04:38:28,540 --> 04:38:29,500
If you like Picross,

3450
04:38:29,500 --> 04:38:33,819
there's a cool one on the DS called Picross 3D

3451
04:38:33,819 --> 04:38:35,459
where you start with a cube and uncover an object

3452
04:38:35,459 --> 04:38:37,020
within using the Picross number system

3453
04:38:37,020 --> 04:38:38,419
you might be interested.

3454
04:38:38,419 --> 04:38:40,529
I think I owned that.

3455
04:38:40,529 --> 04:38:42,569
I owned two Picross games for 3D.

3456
04:38:42,569 --> 04:38:48,169
Yes.

3457
04:38:48,169 --> 04:38:49,090
One of them was normal.

3458
04:38:49,090 --> 04:38:54,029
The other one was a 3D one if I remember.

3459
04:38:54,029 --> 04:38:54,869
That's cool though.

3460
04:38:54,869 --> 04:38:56,459
Maybe I'll check that out.

3461
04:38:56,459 --> 04:39:01,560
That'd be cool to have for a stream.

3462
04:39:01,560 --> 04:39:03,080
Hey, thank you DorkCube for the 250.

3463
04:39:03,080 --> 04:39:03,919
Oh my God.

3464
04:39:03,919 --> 04:39:06,759
I have a story to one up the Oreos in mom's bed.

3465
04:39:06,759 --> 04:39:09,889
I don't even care that it was a dream.

3466
04:39:09,889 --> 04:39:12,459
Yeah, but that's not,

3467
04:39:12,459 --> 04:39:13,939
it wasn't a real story.

3468
04:39:13,939 --> 04:39:16,020
It was me telling you a dream I had.

3469
04:39:16,020 --> 04:39:17,259
That didn't happen.

3470
04:39:17,259 --> 04:39:19,180
I actually threw up in my mother's bed.

3471
04:39:19,180 --> 04:39:26,669
That is a real story, not a dream.

3472
04:39:26,669 --> 04:39:28,310
Thank you Alpha Librarian for the 250.

3473
04:39:28,310 --> 04:39:29,709
Turns out you need to sign

3474
04:39:29,709 --> 04:39:35,209
an ultimate gaming question sheet for the book.

3475
04:39:35,209 --> 04:39:38,580
You can get the book for 20% off.

3476
04:39:38,580 --> 04:39:42,529
No, that's all good.

3477
04:39:42,529 --> 04:39:43,689
I don't need any books.

3478
04:39:43,689 --> 04:39:44,529
I got plenty of them.

3479
04:39:44,529 --> 04:39:46,220
I read a lot.

3480
04:39:46,220 --> 04:39:49,889
12 books a month at the end of the year.

3481
04:39:49,889 --> 04:39:51,849
Ferodian Weapon again, $50.

3482
04:39:51,849 --> 04:39:56,139
A lot of fucking money.

3483
04:39:56,139 --> 04:39:59,169
A lot.

3484
04:39:59,169 --> 04:40:04,979
DorkCube, thanks for the 250.

3485
04:40:04,979 --> 04:40:06,139
This may be an odd question,

3486
04:40:06,139 --> 04:40:07,779
but I just listened to a podcast earlier

3487
04:40:07,779 --> 04:40:09,459
that reminded me of the topic.

3488
04:40:09,459 --> 04:40:12,060
Did you listen to Ska when you were younger?

3489
04:40:12,060 --> 04:40:20,950
Ska, does the Mighty Mighty Bossstones count?

3490
04:40:20,950 --> 04:40:27,630
That's close, kind of, but not really, right?

3491
04:40:27,630 --> 04:40:31,099
Yes, I loved the Mighty Mighty Bossstones.

3492
04:40:31,099 --> 04:40:33,060
The Mighty Mighty Bossstones were my favorite band

3493
04:40:33,060 --> 04:40:35,159
when I was 14, 15.

3494
04:40:35,159 --> 04:40:39,200
Maybe even a little younger, like 13.

3495
04:40:39,200 --> 04:40:41,119
You look like a Ska listener.

3496
04:40:41,119 --> 04:40:47,020
What does that mean?

3497
04:40:47,020 --> 04:40:50,299
I remember being on the bus to a field trip

3498
04:40:50,299 --> 04:40:52,139
and listening to the whole CD twice

3499
04:40:52,139 --> 04:40:54,200
because it was a long drive.

3500
04:40:54,200 --> 04:40:58,340
I had a Walkman with one of those discs,

3501
04:40:58,340 --> 04:41:08,939
disc players, it was great.

3502
04:41:08,939 --> 04:41:12,759
And back then, the biggest technology was making sure

3503
04:41:12,759 --> 04:41:15,840
that if you grabbed or moved the Walkman,

3504
04:41:15,840 --> 04:41:16,680
that it didn't...

3505
04:41:18,490 --> 04:41:19,529
That was a huge technology.

3506
04:41:19,529 --> 04:41:22,409
Non-skippable discs would mean you could pick it up,

3507
04:41:22,409 --> 04:41:24,049
you could put it in your pocket.

3508
04:41:24,049 --> 04:41:28,409
If you went on a bump in the car, it didn't skip,

3509
04:41:28,409 --> 04:41:29,729
it buffered.

3510
04:41:29,729 --> 04:41:35,040
First, by the way, first ever form of buffering

3511
04:41:35,040 --> 04:41:39,689
was CDs having the no skip feature.

3512
04:41:39,689 --> 04:41:41,990
It would almost download and prepare,

3513
04:41:41,990 --> 04:41:48,580
buffer, you could even say, two or three seconds ahead.

3514
04:41:48,580 --> 04:41:50,619
Somebody made a million dollars with that

3515
04:41:50,619 --> 04:41:53,759
because then that turned into buffering.

3516
04:41:53,759 --> 04:42:00,349
Fucking Bob buffer, nice job.

3517
04:42:00,349 --> 04:42:02,330
But yeah, Mighty Mighty Bossstones.

3518
04:42:02,369 --> 04:42:04,659
Hey, C4G, thanks for the 250.

3519
04:42:04,659 --> 04:42:05,900
Hey, Germany, do you have any VR games

3520
04:42:05,900 --> 04:42:07,619
you'd most recommend from the ones you've played?

3521
04:42:07,619 --> 04:42:08,779
Absolutely.

3522
04:42:08,779 --> 04:42:12,299
I have Beat Saber and Superhot and they slap.

3523
04:42:12,299 --> 04:42:13,939
Also, please say something really funny here

3524
04:42:13,939 --> 04:42:16,060
so people clip it so I can find this easily

3525
04:42:16,060 --> 04:42:20,150
when I wake up tomorrow, thank you.

3526
04:42:20,150 --> 04:42:25,200
Do you want to do the horn?

3527
04:42:25,200 --> 04:42:26,759
Somebody will clip that, it's gonna be like horn

3528
04:42:26,759 --> 04:42:32,200
and then you'll be, there it is.

3529
04:42:32,200 --> 04:42:35,540
But Superhot VR is probably,

3530
04:42:35,540 --> 04:42:38,099
I would say in the top five for sure.

3531
04:42:38,099 --> 04:42:41,779
Blade and Sorcery was really, really great.

3532
04:42:44,159 --> 04:42:47,790
Pavlov is probably the best game

3533
04:42:47,790 --> 04:42:49,369
that you can play for multiplayer, I think,

3534
04:42:49,369 --> 04:42:55,860
at least what I've played so far.

3535
04:42:55,860 --> 04:42:59,319
If you haven't played Blade and Sorcery, it's fantastic.

3536
04:42:59,319 --> 04:43:00,680
Pavlov, again.

3537
04:43:04,529 --> 04:43:10,889
Even like Climie, Climie was really fun too.

3538
04:43:10,889 --> 04:43:16,580
Very simple, but there's workshop support.

3539
04:43:16,580 --> 04:43:18,580
But we'll see, maybe my opinion changes tomorrow

3540
04:43:18,580 --> 04:43:20,340
because there's another three or four games in VR

3541
04:43:20,340 --> 04:43:23,819
I'm gonna play tomorrow.

3542
04:43:23,819 --> 04:43:27,799
We should have a great time, looking forward to it.

3543
04:43:27,799 --> 04:43:31,319
Oh, Dread Halls, that's right.

3544
04:43:31,319 --> 04:43:32,340
If you like horror games,

3545
04:43:32,380 --> 04:43:37,099
Dread Halls is probably the best one for VR.

3546
04:43:37,099 --> 04:43:43,130
Does not, do you think there would be a shitload of them?

3547
04:43:43,130 --> 04:43:48,569
Dread Halls, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

3548
04:43:48,569 --> 04:43:49,810
The bar fight game was funny,

3549
04:43:49,810 --> 04:43:55,979
but it's really only like 30 to 40 minutes.

3550
04:43:55,979 --> 04:43:57,299
You don't get like an entire experience.

3551
04:43:57,299 --> 04:43:58,819
It's like a 25 minute experience

3552
04:43:58,819 --> 04:43:59,740
to punch people in the face

3553
04:43:59,740 --> 04:44:02,509
and throw chairs at people.

3554
04:44:02,509 --> 04:44:06,509
Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades

3555
04:44:06,509 --> 04:44:08,959
is another good one.

3556
04:44:08,959 --> 04:44:13,720
If you like simulated weaponry and a million different axes

3557
04:44:13,720 --> 04:44:15,720
and there's like a sniper rifles

3558
04:44:16,680 --> 04:44:18,040
and like the range,

3559
04:44:18,040 --> 04:44:22,990
there's all kinds of stuff in that game.

3560
04:44:22,990 --> 04:44:24,990
Did I see the tweet by Twitch about Dread Halls?

3561
04:44:24,990 --> 04:44:28,900
I did, yeah, it's funny.

3562
04:44:28,900 --> 04:44:30,659
It's funny, they like, they bleeped out the swears

3563
04:44:30,659 --> 04:44:33,130
and they like cut me out.

3564
04:44:33,130 --> 04:44:33,970
They like, yeah, get this,

3565
04:44:33,970 --> 04:44:35,750
I don't, we don't want his like big,

3566
04:44:35,750 --> 04:44:37,189
ugly, gross body in here.

3567
04:44:37,189 --> 04:44:44,900
We just want like the, with the joke.

3568
04:44:44,900 --> 04:44:48,979
Yeah, the official Twitch Twitter

3569
04:44:48,979 --> 04:44:54,000
did a little, nice little shout out on their Twitter.

3570
04:44:54,000 --> 04:45:01,090
It was really cool, pretty cool.

3571
04:45:01,090 --> 04:45:03,130
But let's keep going, almost done.

3572
04:45:03,130 --> 04:45:06,779
We got just a little bit to go through.

3573
04:45:06,779 --> 04:45:09,419
It's time for slime, thanks to the three bucks.

3574
04:45:09,419 --> 04:45:11,700
Hello, Jerma, please activate that cool gamer loot

3575
04:45:11,700 --> 04:45:14,610
in stream legends.

3576
04:45:14,610 --> 04:45:21,189
You got it.

3577
04:45:21,189 --> 04:45:27,020
What level is the guild?

3578
04:45:27,020 --> 04:45:35,880
Are we, have we taken over anything yet?

3579
04:45:35,880 --> 04:45:36,700
All right, you ready?

3580
04:45:36,700 --> 04:45:39,159
I don't know if you have to have it open or not.

3581
04:45:39,159 --> 04:45:41,200
Level 38.

3582
04:45:41,200 --> 04:45:43,500
All right, if you want it, get it open.

3583
04:45:43,500 --> 04:45:44,779
I'm not sure if you,

3584
04:45:44,779 --> 04:45:48,180
maybe you have to have it open or not.

3585
04:45:48,180 --> 04:45:52,880
Three, two, one, here you go.

3586
04:45:52,880 --> 04:45:56,779
Remind me to do that again tomorrow.

3587
04:45:56,779 --> 04:45:57,900
Because if people are having fun with that

3588
04:45:57,900 --> 04:45:59,860
and it's just something interesting little idle thing

3589
04:45:59,860 --> 04:46:01,099
that they do for fun,

3590
04:46:01,099 --> 04:46:09,450
then yeah, just always remind me to do that.

3591
04:46:09,450 --> 04:46:10,810
But thank you, it's time for slime.

3592
04:46:10,810 --> 04:46:14,009
Hope you enjoy your free stuff.

3593
04:46:14,009 --> 04:46:17,080
Hey, C4G, thanks for the $5 here.

3594
04:46:17,080 --> 04:46:20,700
Also, Minecraft VR is honestly pretty good

3595
04:46:20,700 --> 04:46:22,500
as long as you liked Minecraft to begin with.

3596
04:46:22,500 --> 04:46:25,299
The cows are too big, so they're kind of scary

3597
04:46:25,299 --> 04:46:27,340
and you get nauseous like really easy.

3598
04:46:27,340 --> 04:46:34,740
So you know what I changed my mind, it sucks.

3599
04:46:34,740 --> 04:46:37,599
Also, Hatsune Miku VR sucks,

3600
04:46:37,599 --> 04:46:40,060
which is the same because I love Miku,

3601
04:46:40,060 --> 04:46:41,900
but it's not worth $25.

3602
04:46:41,900 --> 04:46:46,729
Okay, I'm out of bits, bye.

3603
04:46:46,770 --> 04:46:52,900
What is Hatsune Miku VR?

3604
04:46:52,900 --> 04:46:57,020
Isn't, wait, isn't Hatsune Miku the pop star,

3605
04:46:57,020 --> 04:47:04,380
the animated pop star thing?

3606
04:47:04,380 --> 04:47:05,299
Oh, okay.

3607
04:47:05,299 --> 04:47:12,700
Well, I'm sorry that you didn't think it was worth it.

3608
04:47:12,700 --> 04:47:13,520
He doesn't know.

3609
04:47:13,520 --> 04:47:16,830
I mean, I do, I just told you what it was.

3610
04:47:16,830 --> 04:47:20,360
I just said what it is.

3611
04:47:20,360 --> 04:47:22,340
Miku and Jerma collab when?

3612
04:47:22,340 --> 04:47:23,919
I don't know.

3613
04:47:23,919 --> 04:47:25,919
I don't do collabs.

3614
04:47:25,919 --> 04:47:28,779
Or organically we'll hang out with somebody

3615
04:47:28,779 --> 04:47:33,340
and maybe we'll do something together.

3616
04:47:33,340 --> 04:47:36,930
He doesn't know.

3617
04:47:36,930 --> 04:47:38,919
Get the Miku game.

3618
04:47:38,919 --> 04:47:48,400
I don't think so.

3619
04:47:48,400 --> 04:47:51,919
Thank you, Genny, Benny for the three bucks.

3620
04:47:51,919 --> 04:47:53,759
Jerma, you're telling me your Sega is dead.

3621
04:47:53,759 --> 04:47:55,619
He overheated.

3622
04:47:55,619 --> 04:47:56,459
It's dead.

3623
04:47:56,459 --> 04:48:00,389
No, it's fine.

3624
04:48:00,389 --> 04:48:01,430
That's the first Dreamcast game

3625
04:48:01,430 --> 04:48:05,040
that I had a problem with.

3626
04:48:05,040 --> 04:48:10,240
So I don't know.

3627
04:48:10,240 --> 04:48:12,779
It was weird that the background wasn't there.

3628
04:48:12,779 --> 04:48:14,500
Scenes were disappearing.

3629
04:48:14,500 --> 04:48:17,259
The game, remember the game just locked up?

3630
04:48:17,259 --> 04:48:19,299
That was really weird.

3631
04:48:19,299 --> 04:48:22,819
They were just standing there and she was blinking.

3632
04:48:22,819 --> 04:48:23,939
That was odd,

3633
04:48:23,939 --> 04:48:27,540
but maybe it was a problem with the Dreamcast.

3634
04:48:27,580 --> 04:48:29,020
I don't think so.

3635
04:48:29,020 --> 04:48:29,860
Fucking bootleg.

3636
04:48:29,860 --> 04:48:34,680
I can't believe it if that's true.

3637
04:48:34,680 --> 04:48:37,700
I made such a big deal about opening that wrapper and shit.

3638
04:48:37,700 --> 04:48:39,139
People are probably talking so much shit

3639
04:48:39,139 --> 04:48:40,599
and laughing their ass off

3640
04:48:40,599 --> 04:48:41,439
at the fact that I'm like,

3641
04:48:41,439 --> 04:48:44,919
oh, look in the wrapper, cool.

3642
04:48:44,919 --> 04:48:52,069
It's like a bootleg fucking disc.

3643
04:48:52,069 --> 04:48:53,090
What?

3644
04:48:53,090 --> 04:48:58,330
80 year old.

3645
04:48:58,330 --> 04:49:01,889
We all get scammed once in a while.

3646
04:49:01,889 --> 04:49:04,209
Thank you, Pika Banana for the $10.31.

3647
04:49:04,209 --> 04:49:05,509
That wasn't a boring stream.

3648
04:49:05,509 --> 04:49:07,290
We're here for you, not the games.

3649
04:49:07,290 --> 04:49:08,330
All the crazy games you play

3650
04:49:08,330 --> 04:49:11,790
wouldn't be as fun to watch without you, Jerma Hart.

3651
04:49:12,750 --> 04:49:16,639
I really appreciate that.

3652
04:49:16,639 --> 04:49:19,639
I do.

3653
04:49:19,639 --> 04:49:23,630
But still, I want each stream to be fun.

3654
04:49:23,630 --> 04:49:24,830
I want people to not go,

3655
04:49:24,830 --> 04:49:25,869
oh, here we go again.

3656
04:49:25,869 --> 04:49:26,990
Or, well, this sucked.

3657
04:49:26,990 --> 04:49:29,259
Oh yeah, that was bad.

3658
04:49:29,259 --> 04:49:30,200
Even if that's the case,

3659
04:49:30,200 --> 04:49:33,619
I know I never want that to happen.

3660
04:49:33,619 --> 04:49:36,700
I want each broadcast to be as good as the last one,

3661
04:49:36,700 --> 04:49:37,979
as good as the one that was a week ago,

3662
04:49:37,979 --> 04:49:43,520
as good as the one that was a month ago.

3663
04:49:43,520 --> 04:49:45,000
And it's not, I'm not really,

3664
04:49:45,000 --> 04:49:45,819
I'm fine.

3665
04:49:45,819 --> 04:49:46,979
Like I had a blast.

3666
04:49:46,979 --> 04:49:52,560
Things were fun.

3667
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:53,580
I wasn't upset or anything.

3668
04:49:53,580 --> 04:49:55,909
It's not like I'm mad.

3669
04:49:55,909 --> 04:49:59,150
It's just, you know what I want?

3670
04:49:59,150 --> 04:50:01,110
I want it to go the way that I want it.

3671
04:50:01,110 --> 04:50:03,240
And when it doesn't,

3672
04:50:03,240 --> 04:50:08,930
it can be like, like shit.

3673
04:50:08,930 --> 04:50:10,770
Was the whole stream picked across?

3674
04:50:10,770 --> 04:50:12,880
No.

3675
04:50:12,880 --> 04:50:13,840
We only went to picked across.

3676
04:50:13,840 --> 04:50:16,779
That's not even a pick cross

3677
04:50:16,779 --> 04:50:22,950
because of the technical problems I had with the Dreamcast.

3678
04:50:22,950 --> 04:50:26,889
Kind of threw everything out of whack.

3679
04:50:26,889 --> 04:50:28,319
But it's all right.

3680
04:50:28,319 --> 04:50:31,270
We move on, we play, we do it again tomorrow.

3681
04:50:31,270 --> 04:50:33,840
I still had a lot of fun on this stream.

3682
04:50:33,840 --> 04:50:39,720
I had fun on pretty much every stream.

3683
04:50:39,720 --> 04:50:41,119
I had a lot of fun on the last stream

3684
04:50:41,119 --> 04:50:42,159
from yesterday, you know?

3685
04:50:42,159 --> 04:50:46,380
It's, I don't, I'm not like giving points

3686
04:50:46,380 --> 04:50:47,860
and taking points away per stream.

3687
04:50:47,860 --> 04:50:49,060
Like, oh, that one was an eight.

3688
04:50:49,060 --> 04:50:49,979
That one was an eight.

3689
04:50:49,979 --> 04:50:50,819
That was a seven.

3690
04:50:50,819 --> 04:50:53,509
That was a two.

3691
04:50:53,509 --> 04:50:57,130
I just want them to go well.

3692
04:50:57,130 --> 04:51:00,200
Right?

3693
04:51:00,200 --> 04:51:01,759
Modest Narcissists,

3694
04:51:01,759 --> 04:51:05,630
thanks for the $10.

3695
04:51:05,630 --> 04:51:07,630
No, 10 community subs, not $10.

3696
04:51:07,630 --> 04:51:13,369
What am I talking about?

3697
04:51:13,369 --> 04:51:14,639
Thank you.

3698
04:51:14,639 --> 04:51:23,500
For all the community subs.

3699
04:51:23,500 --> 04:51:24,939
Thank you, GeniBeni for the five,

3700
04:51:24,939 --> 04:51:28,939
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, $11 here.

3701
04:51:28,939 --> 04:51:31,930
Hey, don't you think chat's annoying?

3702
04:51:31,930 --> 04:51:33,630
Like that pianist.

3703
04:51:33,630 --> 04:51:34,470
You're right.

3704
04:51:34,470 --> 04:51:44,479
Let's get some rock music in here.

3705
04:51:44,479 --> 04:51:47,880
How could you say something like that?

3706
04:51:47,880 --> 04:51:49,439
Jerma, it's illegal to download music

3707
04:51:49,439 --> 04:51:51,650
and movies off the internet.

3708
04:51:51,650 --> 04:51:54,459
I'm gonna go to internet jail.

3709
04:51:54,459 --> 04:51:57,759
It's not illegal to listen to music

3710
04:51:57,759 --> 04:52:06,799
on official Vivo YouTube account.

3711
04:52:06,799 --> 04:52:08,279
You wouldn't download a car.

3712
04:52:11,490 --> 04:52:12,810
Thank you, Siroc for the 250.

3713
04:52:12,810 --> 04:52:15,290
When you die, science will preserve your brain

3714
04:52:15,290 --> 04:52:17,049
and will harvest all your unused video

3715
04:52:17,049 --> 04:52:18,849
and stream ideas.

3716
04:52:18,849 --> 04:52:21,450
Also, Joel streamed 3D Movie Maker five days ago

3717
04:52:21,450 --> 04:52:29,220
and he got Sans to be in it.

3718
04:52:29,220 --> 04:52:31,119
It's a wonderful program.

3719
04:52:31,119 --> 04:52:38,229
I hope he had a lot of fun.

3720
04:52:38,229 --> 04:52:40,470
That program can be hell

3721
04:52:40,470 --> 04:52:45,279
to get to run stably at like 800 by 600.

3722
04:52:45,279 --> 04:52:49,840
Hopefully he got it to work pretty well.

3723
04:52:49,840 --> 04:52:56,189
But it's a blast if you can get it to work.

3724
04:52:56,189 --> 04:53:00,409
Sans confirmed for wrap movie three.

3725
04:53:00,409 --> 04:53:01,650
Something about the thanks in three bucks.

3726
04:53:01,650 --> 04:53:03,889
Hey Jerms, grandma found out I had her credit card.

3727
04:53:03,889 --> 04:53:04,729
I gotta get out of here.

3728
04:53:04,729 --> 04:53:05,810
I gotta go.

3729
04:53:05,810 --> 04:53:08,569
Don't use, don't do that.

3730
04:53:08,569 --> 04:53:10,919
I know you're fucking around.

3731
04:53:10,919 --> 04:53:14,939
But don't, don't, fuck, what are you thinking?

3732
04:53:14,939 --> 04:53:16,900
Are you fucking, are you serious?

3733
04:53:16,900 --> 04:53:21,680
Don't do that shit.

3734
04:53:21,680 --> 04:53:23,159
Sorry.

3735
04:53:23,159 --> 04:53:24,040
Say sorry.

3736
04:53:24,040 --> 04:53:32,349
Sorry.

3737
04:53:32,349 --> 04:53:34,069
Freudian weapon thanks for the five dollars, Freudian.

3738
04:53:34,069 --> 04:53:36,630
Random thought, but your old 500 subscriber video

3739
04:53:36,630 --> 04:53:38,790
really helps me power through my workouts.

3740
04:53:38,790 --> 04:53:41,810
It's the same kind of energy I try to have at the gym.

3741
04:53:41,810 --> 04:53:51,279
Yep, I used to love working out.

3742
04:53:51,279 --> 04:53:53,080
I miss those days sometimes,

3743
04:53:53,080 --> 04:53:59,500
but I'm kind of a mess if I'm honest.

3744
04:53:59,500 --> 04:54:01,919
I get like sore really easily now.

3745
04:54:01,959 --> 04:54:09,259
It just sucks, but it's all right.

3746
04:54:09,259 --> 04:54:15,040
Same energy.

3747
04:54:15,040 --> 04:54:19,340
I forget that it was almost eight years ago.

3748
04:54:19,340 --> 04:54:22,330
No, that was eight years ago.

3749
04:54:22,330 --> 04:54:29,099
I made my first YouTube videos just like fucking stacked.

3750
04:54:29,099 --> 04:54:37,720
Almost 10 years has gone by.

3751
04:54:37,720 --> 04:54:39,900
It's a long time.

3752
04:54:39,900 --> 04:54:41,700
Then I'm just happy to still be here.

3753
04:54:41,700 --> 04:54:45,889
I'm happy that eight years later there is,

3754
04:54:45,889 --> 04:54:47,009
I still, you know,

3755
04:54:47,009 --> 04:54:49,009
people still think this is interesting.

3756
04:54:50,009 --> 04:54:53,560
I still think this is interesting.

3757
04:54:53,560 --> 04:54:56,990
Holy shit, it took me forever to focus on anything.

3758
04:54:56,990 --> 04:55:01,069
Eight years?

3759
04:55:01,069 --> 04:55:12,540
I could barely keep my shoes tied for eight years.

3760
04:55:12,540 --> 04:55:15,080
Thank you.

3761
04:55:15,080 --> 04:55:16,919
I do miss those old workouts though.

3762
04:55:16,919 --> 04:55:19,150
They were a lot of fun.

3763
04:55:19,150 --> 04:55:20,709
Tingy thanks for the 250.

3764
04:55:20,709 --> 04:55:22,029
Hey Jermbo, I don't know if you're away,

3765
04:55:22,029 --> 04:55:24,349
but Twitch allows custom cheer modes.

3766
04:55:25,700 --> 04:55:27,340
I think we can see some custom cheer modes

3767
04:55:27,340 --> 04:55:29,020
related to the channel.

3768
04:55:29,020 --> 04:55:33,299
Maybe animated Jermachomp or OG Jerm doing the same.

3769
04:55:33,540 --> 04:55:34,380
Hope you consider this.

3770
04:55:34,380 --> 04:55:35,220
I'd love to see it.

3771
04:55:35,220 --> 04:55:37,490
I'm sure chat would too.

3772
04:55:37,490 --> 04:55:39,889
Yeah, actually, I gotta get in touch with Lordell

3773
04:55:40,810 --> 04:55:43,049
because there are a bunch of random things

3774
04:55:43,049 --> 04:55:45,209
that I'm gonna add to the channel.

3775
04:55:45,209 --> 04:55:48,720
We talked about it a little bit last week.

3776
04:55:48,720 --> 04:55:50,520
There will be animated cheer boats.

3777
04:55:50,520 --> 04:55:51,840
There will be new screens.

3778
04:55:51,840 --> 04:55:53,119
There will be some new music.

3779
04:55:53,119 --> 04:55:57,369
There will be some new animations.

3780
04:55:57,369 --> 04:55:58,209
It's been long enough.

3781
04:55:58,209 --> 04:56:00,919
I think it's time to do some more.

3782
04:56:00,919 --> 04:56:07,319
Maybe some more emotes too to fill up some slots.

3783
04:56:07,319 --> 04:56:09,720
I'll be getting in contact with him very soon.

3784
04:56:21,909 --> 04:56:29,720
There's another Vroom.

3785
04:56:29,720 --> 04:56:32,680
Another Vroom.

3786
04:56:32,680 --> 04:56:33,520
There they go.

3787
04:56:37,919 --> 04:56:43,840
There they go.

3788
04:56:43,840 --> 04:56:47,599
Vroom emote, that's not a bad idea.

3789
04:56:47,599 --> 04:56:48,479
I feel, I don't know though.

3790
04:56:48,479 --> 04:56:51,669
I feel like, do you think that would get tiring

3791
04:56:51,669 --> 04:56:54,889
after a while?

3792
04:56:54,889 --> 04:56:55,729
It might.

3793
04:56:55,729 --> 04:57:01,419
It might be a next situation where it just cars.

3794
04:57:01,419 --> 04:57:02,259
I don't know.

3795
04:57:02,259 --> 04:57:03,180
That's a tough one.

3796
04:57:15,130 --> 04:57:19,069
Thank you Paul in shirt for the $5.

3797
04:57:19,069 --> 04:57:21,610
Jerm, I made a gamer test for you.

3798
04:57:21,610 --> 04:57:24,229
Do it on stream.

3799
04:57:24,229 --> 04:57:28,209
This is a random link here.

3800
04:57:28,209 --> 04:57:30,290
This is something that I wanna make sure everyone's aware.

3801
04:57:30,290 --> 04:57:36,869
I don't click random links in bit donations.

3802
04:57:37,029 --> 04:57:40,590
If it's an mgirl link, if it's a YouTube link,

3803
04:57:40,590 --> 04:57:43,509
that's fine, but I don't just click random links

3804
04:57:43,509 --> 04:57:45,909
unless they're, you gotta be careful.

3805
04:57:46,950 --> 04:57:55,299
And Jerma lied about Minecraft VR is,

3806
04:57:55,299 --> 04:58:00,700
you're gonna have to change that username tomorrow.

3807
04:58:00,700 --> 04:58:07,939
But thank you for the five community subs.

3808
04:58:07,939 --> 04:58:09,139
Discord image links too.

3809
04:58:09,139 --> 04:58:12,779
Yeah, those are fine.

3810
04:58:12,779 --> 04:58:20,759
But if you have a link that's not one of those places,

3811
04:58:20,779 --> 04:58:21,819
you've got, we probably,

3812
04:58:21,819 --> 04:58:24,400
here's what's probably gonna have to happen.

3813
04:58:24,400 --> 04:58:28,060
I'm probably gonna have to get them screened

3814
04:58:28,060 --> 04:58:31,259
by a mod or something to make sure that it's,

3815
04:58:31,259 --> 04:58:32,180
you know, whatever it is

3816
04:58:32,180 --> 04:58:33,540
and then they can tell me about it later.

3817
04:58:33,540 --> 04:58:36,540
Well, as I'm in the end here,

3818
04:58:36,540 --> 04:58:39,419
because I really just can't click on random stuff.

3819
04:58:42,229 --> 04:58:44,990
Somebody, a person, no.

3820
04:58:44,990 --> 04:58:49,150
A person to taste the food before the king eats it.

3821
04:58:49,150 --> 04:58:54,709
But really though, oh, he dropped dead.

3822
04:58:54,709 --> 04:58:58,659
I'm not eating that meat pie.

3823
04:58:58,659 --> 04:59:00,340
What if a mod betrays you?

3824
04:59:00,340 --> 04:59:05,340
Long story short, if it's not Imgur YouTube Discord,

3825
04:59:06,169 --> 04:59:07,650
or like something that is,

3826
04:59:07,650 --> 04:59:09,610
I know exactly what it is from the link,

3827
04:59:09,610 --> 04:59:12,310
hyperlink itself, I'm not gonna click it.

3828
04:59:14,790 --> 04:59:15,630
I don't make that,

3829
04:59:15,630 --> 04:59:21,669
I'm probably gonna put that in the rules too.

3830
04:59:21,669 --> 04:59:22,509
I gotta be careful.

3831
04:59:22,509 --> 04:59:25,630
I gotta take care of myself, right?

3832
04:59:25,630 --> 04:59:30,860
But thank you for the $5.

3833
04:59:30,860 --> 04:59:32,860
And while some links might not look malicious,

3834
04:59:32,860 --> 04:59:36,259
I'm not saying this one is.

3835
04:59:36,259 --> 04:59:41,610
You never know, you just gotta be careful.

3836
04:59:41,610 --> 04:59:47,279
Notavirus.gov.

3837
04:59:47,279 --> 04:59:50,439
I do appreciate anything that anybody makes,

3838
04:59:50,439 --> 04:59:51,599
but we're probably gonna have to do a system

3839
04:59:51,599 --> 04:59:57,990
where links get sort of pre-screened.

3840
04:59:57,990 --> 04:59:59,270
Because I feel like I have missed things

3841
04:59:59,270 --> 05:00:01,310
people have sent me because I didn't wanna click it,

3842
05:00:01,310 --> 05:00:05,099
because I was like, I don't know what this is.

3843
05:00:05,099 --> 05:00:08,979
I'm gonna get a system in place.

3844
05:00:08,979 --> 05:00:10,880
But thank you for the $5, thank you.

3845
05:00:13,110 --> 05:00:14,569
Don't click, it's a gnome.

3846
05:00:22,069 --> 05:00:31,610
Don't click, it's a gnome.

3847
05:00:31,610 --> 05:00:35,169
But that was right, Dai gave 200 bucks right there too,

3848
05:00:35,169 --> 05:00:36,209
like 40 minutes ago.

3849
05:00:47,939 --> 05:00:49,740
Pasta's almost ready.

3850
05:00:49,740 --> 05:00:53,259
That's from Kim.

3851
05:00:53,259 --> 05:00:58,439
Oh shit, boys and girls, pasta.

3852
05:00:58,439 --> 05:00:59,700
All right, I gotta get out of here, I gotta go.

3853
05:00:59,700 --> 05:01:03,529
I gotta get out of here, I gotta get out.

3854
05:01:03,529 --> 05:01:04,770
It has been like eight hours, huh?

3855
05:01:04,770 --> 05:01:06,700
I haven't eaten, shit.

3856
05:01:06,700 --> 05:01:11,400
All right, well, thank you to Dai for the 200 bucks.

3857
05:01:11,400 --> 05:01:14,000
I'll be spending that on pasta, guaranteed.

3858
05:01:14,000 --> 05:01:15,560
Feroidian weapon, thanks for the 250.

3859
05:01:15,560 --> 05:01:17,599
Wow, it's not often I can stick around for live bits.

3860
05:01:17,599 --> 05:01:20,860
I usually just listen to the VOD with my morning coffee.

3861
05:01:20,860 --> 05:01:23,419
Have a good night, I'll see you tomorrow.

3862
05:01:23,419 --> 05:01:29,020
See you tomorrow, thanks for hanging out.

3863
05:01:29,020 --> 05:01:30,740
That's interesting that you watch the VODs

3864
05:01:30,740 --> 05:01:33,349
with coffee in the morning, that's cool.

3865
05:01:33,349 --> 05:01:38,319
It's an interesting way to do it.

3866
05:01:38,319 --> 05:01:40,659
Hey, Jewish bro, thanks for three bucks.

3867
05:01:40,659 --> 05:01:42,000
I ordered a dork cube and all I got

3868
05:01:42,000 --> 05:01:45,659
was a bunch of rusty razor blades and a lit cigarette

3869
05:01:45,659 --> 05:01:48,700
and is streaming your only job or does Kim work too?

3870
05:01:48,740 --> 05:01:53,799
Also, Ratmovie3 or Riot, Kim also works.

3871
05:01:57,360 --> 05:02:04,549
Kim has a job, tomorrow is my birthday?

3872
05:02:04,549 --> 05:02:06,430
No, your tomorrow is my today.

3873
05:02:06,430 --> 05:02:12,459
I don't know why I thought that you said that.

3874
05:02:12,459 --> 05:02:17,619
But on top of streaming, I also do construction.

3875
05:02:17,619 --> 05:02:22,380
So a lot of the bridges and buildings

3876
05:02:22,380 --> 05:02:29,380
and department buildings and stuff, I design them.

3877
05:02:29,380 --> 05:02:37,659
I design them and then I build them by myself

3878
05:02:37,659 --> 05:02:47,869
in less than two weeks.

3879
05:02:47,869 --> 05:02:52,889
Yo, this guy's a professional liar.

3880
05:02:52,889 --> 05:02:55,540
I should play a fucking game

3881
05:02:55,540 --> 05:02:57,860
where I just don't say anything true the whole stream

3882
05:02:57,860 --> 05:02:58,819
and then people have to figure out

3883
05:02:58,819 --> 05:03:02,930
what is a lie and what's not.

3884
05:03:02,930 --> 05:03:05,250
Let's do that, that sounds like fun.

3885
05:03:05,250 --> 05:03:08,750
Have a way to chat to get involved

3886
05:03:08,750 --> 05:03:12,770
and I'll just say a bunch of dog shit all stream.

3887
05:03:12,770 --> 05:03:14,849
It's just a reverse lie detector.

3888
05:03:14,849 --> 05:03:20,220
That's every stream.

3889
05:03:20,220 --> 05:03:22,860
All Mew, thanks for the 10 bucks, all Mew.

3890
05:03:22,860 --> 05:03:24,500
Oh God, oh God, Jerma, I'm sorry,

3891
05:03:24,500 --> 05:03:26,500
but I can't pay the protection this month.

3892
05:03:26,500 --> 05:03:28,580
Oh shit, please.

3893
05:03:28,580 --> 05:03:32,220
This is all I have, I can't afford to lose.

3894
05:03:32,220 --> 05:03:34,580
You almost got me to say that.

3895
05:03:34,580 --> 05:03:37,659
Thanks for the 10 bucks though, all Mew.

3896
05:03:37,659 --> 05:03:38,500
Thank you.

3897
05:03:38,500 --> 05:03:43,500
Hey, Bobo, Bobo Bobo, thank you Bobo Bobo for the 10 bucks.

3898
05:03:43,599 --> 05:03:45,580
No message, 10 dollars from Bobo Bobo.

3899
05:03:49,750 --> 05:03:53,520
Thank you, Wreckersd, Wreckersd for the 10 bucks.

3900
05:03:53,520 --> 05:03:55,319
Jerma, I tried to send this three times,

3901
05:03:55,319 --> 05:03:57,400
but it was very silly.

3902
05:03:57,400 --> 05:04:00,639
Chat helped me make sure I got it sent this right

3903
05:04:00,639 --> 05:04:03,919
this time, so shout out to the wonderful boys here.

3904
05:04:03,919 --> 05:04:06,680
Love you and enjoy the holidays, Dad.

3905
05:04:06,680 --> 05:04:11,959
Thank you so much for the 10 bucks, Wreckers.

3906
05:04:11,959 --> 05:04:13,680
Incredibly generous amount of money to give me.

3907
05:04:13,680 --> 05:04:15,639
Thank you, glad you figured it out.

3908
05:04:15,639 --> 05:04:19,299
Thank you.

3909
05:04:19,299 --> 05:04:21,380
And thank you, the Cremator for the eight bucks.

3910
05:04:21,380 --> 05:04:24,020
Jerma, it's from a flame thrower

3911
05:04:24,020 --> 05:04:27,000
with the spray and lighter.

3912
05:04:27,000 --> 05:04:33,450
Oh, well don't fucking do that.

3913
05:04:33,490 --> 05:04:35,849
You gotta be fucking careful, don't do that shit.

3914
05:04:50,360 --> 05:04:57,090
Don't play with that kind of stuff.

3915
05:04:57,090 --> 05:04:59,750
Go open up Gary's mod.

3916
05:04:59,750 --> 05:05:01,549
What are you thinking?

3917
05:05:01,549 --> 05:05:09,860
Be careful.

3918
05:05:09,860 --> 05:05:21,700
That's very, very much something you should not be doing.

3919
05:05:21,700 --> 05:05:24,869
But thank you for the eight bucks.

3920
05:05:24,869 --> 05:05:31,979
Take care of yourself, be fucking careful.

3921
05:05:31,979 --> 05:05:33,860
Hey, Bobo Bobo, thanks for the 10 bucks.

3922
05:05:33,860 --> 05:05:34,979
Hey Jerma, I've been a fan of your content

3923
05:05:34,979 --> 05:05:36,819
since the grandpa face reveal.

3924
05:05:36,819 --> 05:05:38,020
That's a long time ago.

3925
05:05:38,939 --> 05:05:40,900
Can't tell you how many times you've made my day

3926
05:05:40,900 --> 05:05:42,580
by watching one of your videos.

3927
05:05:42,580 --> 05:05:44,139
You've helped me through so much over the years.

3928
05:05:44,139 --> 05:05:46,380
I want to give you a personal thank you

3929
05:05:46,380 --> 05:05:48,389
for all that you've done.

3930
05:05:48,389 --> 05:05:54,830
Well, Bobo Bob, I actually think it might be Bobo Bob 99.

3931
05:05:56,560 --> 05:05:58,200
That's $20 here from me.

3932
05:05:58,200 --> 05:06:00,360
That's more than I could ever, ever expect somebody

3933
05:06:00,360 --> 05:06:03,500
to pay me for any reason.

3934
05:06:03,500 --> 05:06:05,139
And that grandpa face reveal,

3935
05:06:05,139 --> 05:06:08,400
I do remember making that.

3936
05:06:08,400 --> 05:06:10,290
That was a fun one to make.

3937
05:06:10,290 --> 05:06:11,529
Thank you so much for sticking around

3938
05:06:11,529 --> 05:06:13,930
for like fucking seven years.

3939
05:06:13,930 --> 05:06:34,000
That's a long ass time, thank you.

3940
05:06:34,000 --> 05:06:35,360
Grandpa is dead.

3941
05:06:35,360 --> 05:06:40,279
No, grandpa is in hell.

3942
05:06:40,279 --> 05:06:42,599
So, you know, whatever.

3943
05:06:46,479 --> 05:06:54,279
Okay, so what does that mean exactly?

3944
05:06:54,279 --> 05:06:57,389
Right, you know the lore.

3945
05:06:57,389 --> 05:06:59,599
I don't need to explain it.

3946
05:06:59,599 --> 05:07:00,520
Jess, you got it.

3947
05:07:00,520 --> 05:07:01,360
Thanks for the 250.

3948
05:07:01,360 --> 05:07:04,279
Making a full song on stream would be really cool.

3949
05:07:04,279 --> 05:07:05,680
You could use your beatboxing ability.

3950
05:07:05,680 --> 05:07:10,159
Joel did one before with beef songs called Pigeon Techno.

3951
05:07:10,159 --> 05:07:17,880
I still wanna do, I still wanna do that Fruity Loops stream.

3952
05:07:18,360 --> 05:07:23,069
I wanna get people to actually play instruments though.

3953
05:07:23,069 --> 05:07:23,909
It's too many.

3954
05:07:23,909 --> 05:07:24,750
I gotta focus on one of these ideas.

3955
05:07:24,750 --> 05:07:30,110
I had just too many of them.

3956
05:07:30,110 --> 05:07:33,509
There is something in particular that is gonna,

3957
05:07:33,509 --> 05:07:36,520
it's summertime, it has to be nice around.

3958
05:07:36,520 --> 05:07:38,240
The one of the main things that I've been wanting

3959
05:07:38,240 --> 05:07:40,319
to do for a long time cannot be done

3960
05:07:40,319 --> 05:07:43,040
until it is a higher temperature.

3961
05:07:43,040 --> 05:07:46,040
It's getting there real soon.

3962
05:07:46,040 --> 05:07:48,479
You're just gonna see it one day.

3963
05:07:48,479 --> 05:07:49,520
I'm not gonna talk about it.

3964
05:07:49,520 --> 05:07:55,270
It's just gonna happen.

3965
05:07:55,270 --> 05:07:57,389
Garfield of Monday killer, thank you for the 250.

3966
05:07:57,389 --> 05:07:58,950
Jerma, it's Garf.

3967
05:07:58,950 --> 05:08:00,990
I just got out of Captain Marvel.

3968
05:08:00,990 --> 05:08:02,669
What a movie that was.

3969
05:08:02,669 --> 05:08:04,750
It had a funny orange cat in it.

3970
05:08:04,750 --> 05:08:06,270
Fun fact, Goose the Cat was played

3971
05:08:06,270 --> 05:08:07,830
by four different cats.

3972
05:08:07,830 --> 05:08:09,389
Two of which are named after muppets,

3973
05:08:09,389 --> 05:08:11,029
Gonzo and Rizzo.

3974
05:08:11,029 --> 05:08:12,389
Ain't that sweet.

3975
05:08:12,389 --> 05:08:15,270
Like to see some cat representation in mainstream media

3976
05:08:15,270 --> 05:08:17,630
other than Secret Life of Pets and yours truly.

3977
05:08:20,229 --> 05:08:23,750
Okay, thank Captain Marvel, more like Cat Tan Marvel.

3978
05:08:23,750 --> 05:08:26,029
Thank you, thank you, Chad is just loving that one.

3979
05:08:26,029 --> 05:08:28,790
Chat, more like Cat Zing.

3980
05:08:28,790 --> 05:08:37,990
That's thanks, I will be here all week.

3981
05:08:37,990 --> 05:08:39,840
Is Shazam any good?

3982
05:08:39,840 --> 05:08:41,479
Is that out yet?

3983
05:08:41,479 --> 05:08:44,040
That's the other Captain Marvel.

3984
05:08:44,040 --> 05:08:45,080
I'm gonna go see Captain Marvel.

3985
05:08:45,080 --> 05:08:48,840
I'm gonna go see the other Captain Marvel Shazam.

3986
05:08:48,840 --> 05:08:52,520
I'm gonna see them both and we'll see what is out.

3987
05:08:52,520 --> 05:08:53,840
No, it's not, you just did the smiley face

3988
05:08:53,840 --> 05:08:55,040
like the I'm lying face.

3989
05:08:59,450 --> 05:09:05,229
Early April, it looks pretty good.

3990
05:09:05,229 --> 05:09:11,849
Yeah, it looks wholesome, let's put it that way.

3991
05:09:12,009 --> 05:09:15,759
Thank you, Garfield.

3992
05:09:15,759 --> 05:09:18,159
Thank you to Matt's friend for $30.

3993
05:09:18,159 --> 05:09:19,720
Hey, Jerma, it's my birthday this Sunday.

3994
05:09:19,720 --> 05:09:20,759
Can you sing me happy birthday?

3995
05:09:20,759 --> 05:09:24,439
How about I just say happy birthday?

3996
05:09:24,439 --> 05:09:30,490
March 17th, have a good birthday.

3997
05:09:30,490 --> 05:09:35,000
Have a fantastic birthday bash.

3998
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:39,520
Thank you for the 30 bucks, it's a lot of money.

3999
05:09:39,520 --> 05:09:43,349
Heel's birthday, man.

4000
05:09:43,349 --> 05:09:49,279
Cake and ice cream isn't on its way.

4001
05:09:49,279 --> 05:09:51,119
Thank you, Alf the librarian for $3,

4002
05:09:51,119 --> 05:09:53,840
but Jerma, my books are 20% off.

4003
05:09:53,840 --> 05:09:57,479
You could have a friend 90% off.

4004
05:09:57,479 --> 05:09:59,400
Buy one of my fantastic books.

4005
05:09:59,400 --> 05:10:01,319
My library has retro and new books,

4006
05:10:01,319 --> 05:10:07,610
even fan-made books, rat's books.

4007
05:10:07,610 --> 05:10:13,880
Where do you live that you have all these books?

4008
05:10:13,880 --> 05:10:17,119
Do you live in a, oh, your name's the librarian, right?

4009
05:10:17,119 --> 05:10:18,319
I get it.

4010
05:10:18,319 --> 05:10:25,799
It's another character.

4011
05:10:25,799 --> 05:10:28,240
Why do we have like five different

4012
05:10:28,240 --> 05:10:32,950
role-playing characters here?

4013
05:10:32,950 --> 05:10:36,270
Now I'm starting to get it.

4014
05:10:36,270 --> 05:10:38,790
Every stream there's like a new character.

4015
05:10:38,790 --> 05:10:57,869
It's part of the universe, oh God.

4016
05:10:57,869 --> 05:11:02,650
But thank you.

4017
05:11:02,650 --> 05:11:04,889
Thank you to Hike Zero for the 250.

4018
05:11:04,889 --> 05:11:07,090
Here is my rat movie three song.

4019
05:11:07,090 --> 05:11:09,689
I can't wait to watch the full length feature film.

4020
05:11:09,689 --> 05:11:13,740
Jump and chomp.

4021
05:11:13,740 --> 05:11:24,580
Did you, wait, did you already put this together?

4022
05:11:24,580 --> 05:11:26,099
Did somebody already do this?

4023
05:11:26,099 --> 05:11:36,330
You already did this.

4024
05:11:36,330 --> 05:11:49,490
Let me get it in here.

4025
05:11:49,490 --> 05:11:56,430
Why can I, I can't get this to play.

4026
05:11:56,430 --> 05:12:06,529
What the hell?

4027
05:12:06,529 --> 05:12:16,279
Uh, hold on.

4028
05:12:16,279 --> 05:12:18,720
It worked for me, hold on, let me see if I can.

4029
05:12:21,520 --> 05:12:22,360
Oh, no, that's why.

4030
05:12:22,360 --> 05:12:23,200
Okay, I got it.

4031
05:12:26,099 --> 05:12:33,189
All right, here we go, let's hear it.

4032
05:12:33,229 --> 05:12:36,470
We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.

4033
05:12:36,470 --> 05:12:38,509
We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.

4034
05:12:38,509 --> 05:12:40,509
We're the yet, we're the yet, we're the rat.

4035
05:12:40,509 --> 05:12:42,549
We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.

4036
05:12:42,549 --> 05:12:47,540
We're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.

4037
05:12:47,540 --> 05:12:58,750
Ha ha, what?

4038
05:12:58,750 --> 05:13:02,849
We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.

4039
05:13:02,849 --> 05:13:04,889
We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.

4040
05:13:04,889 --> 05:13:07,450
We're the rats, yes, we're the rats, we're the yet,

4041
05:13:07,450 --> 05:13:09,979
we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the rat.

4042
05:13:09,979 --> 05:13:14,000
Yes, we're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.

4043
05:13:14,000 --> 05:13:18,389
Yes, we're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.

4044
05:13:18,389 --> 05:13:27,119
We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.

4045
05:13:27,119 --> 05:13:33,349
Something like that, something like that.

4046
05:13:33,349 --> 05:13:39,759
Thank you for that, that was fucking awesome.

4047
05:13:39,759 --> 05:13:42,740
That was what was in mind.

4048
05:13:42,740 --> 05:13:45,919
They may have been some lyrics in the middle

4049
05:13:45,919 --> 05:13:50,380
to add some flavor.

4050
05:13:50,380 --> 05:13:52,060
But thank you, Hike Zero, that was fucking,

4051
05:13:52,060 --> 05:13:57,259
that was great, thank you so much.

4052
05:13:57,259 --> 05:13:59,259
Thank you, Nickname Jack for the three bucks.

4053
05:13:59,259 --> 05:14:00,779
Decide to join a random TF2 game

4054
05:14:00,779 --> 05:14:02,619
while you're talking to virtual fish.

4055
05:14:02,619 --> 05:14:05,180
Someone recognizes my name as a reference

4056
05:14:05,180 --> 05:14:07,299
and just asks, did you see the fish

4057
05:14:07,299 --> 05:14:09,180
called Jerma a virgin?

4058
05:14:09,180 --> 05:14:14,590
And you know what I did, absolute gold.

4059
05:14:14,590 --> 05:14:17,319
Link, link, link, link, link.

4060
05:14:17,319 --> 05:14:21,959
Here is the link to the rat song

4061
05:14:21,959 --> 05:14:23,319
that was carefully crafted.

4062
05:14:26,819 --> 05:14:28,099
That's fucking hilarious.

4063
05:14:28,099 --> 05:14:33,479
Thank you, Nickname Jack.

4064
05:14:33,479 --> 05:14:36,459
And then finally, let's run the credits

4065
05:14:36,459 --> 05:14:39,319
while we do, is it one or two more here?

4066
05:14:39,319 --> 05:14:42,020
Credits, there they are.

4067
05:14:42,020 --> 05:14:43,860
Here come all the subs, all the resubs,

4068
05:14:43,860 --> 05:14:49,610
all the new subs.

4069
05:14:49,610 --> 05:14:51,689
You guys continue to keep the wheels spinning

4070
05:14:51,689 --> 05:14:56,700
on this stream and then some.

4071
05:14:56,700 --> 05:15:02,740
Thank you, everybody.

4072
05:15:03,580 --> 05:15:06,119
Oh yeah, the librarian came back in for five dollars.

4073
05:15:06,119 --> 05:15:10,950
We can give you your books, our books for free.

4074
05:15:10,950 --> 05:15:13,069
I don't need free, I don't need a free book.

4075
05:15:13,069 --> 05:15:14,669
I wanna come in there and I wanna rent it

4076
05:15:14,669 --> 05:15:16,569
like a blockbuster.

4077
05:15:16,569 --> 05:15:17,810
I wanna go in there and I wanna bring that book

4078
05:15:17,810 --> 05:15:20,849
back in three days or I have to forget about it.

4079
05:15:20,849 --> 05:15:22,250
And then my parents get a bill in the mail

4080
05:15:22,250 --> 05:15:31,159
for $268 four and a half months later.

4081
05:15:31,159 --> 05:15:38,709
That's what I want.

4082
05:15:38,709 --> 05:15:40,830
Thank you, Cremator for the five dollars.

4083
05:15:40,830 --> 05:15:45,139
Video game flamethrower isn't as fun,

4084
05:15:45,139 --> 05:15:47,500
but it's safe and it's not gonna hurt you.

4085
05:15:53,029 --> 05:15:54,590
Then wait for the library to go out of business

4086
05:15:54,590 --> 05:15:58,060
and never pay the fee.

4087
05:15:58,060 --> 05:16:00,580
I don't remember, did you, did,

4088
05:16:00,580 --> 05:16:04,549
they used to probably go to collections, right?

4089
05:16:04,549 --> 05:16:06,709
If you, did they do that back then?

4090
05:16:06,709 --> 05:16:12,790
I don't remember.

4091
05:16:12,790 --> 05:16:16,409
If you didn't pay for months and months

4092
05:16:16,409 --> 05:16:18,599
and months or a year,

4093
05:16:18,599 --> 05:16:24,439
did Blockbuster ever send your bill to collections?

4094
05:16:24,439 --> 05:16:28,580
I don't know.

4095
05:16:28,580 --> 05:16:32,750
If you don't turn up for a year, they would erase it.

4096
05:16:32,750 --> 05:16:38,299
Wow, that's kind of ridiculous.

4097
05:16:38,459 --> 05:16:41,880
I mean, I guess how would they be able to keep track of that?

4098
05:16:41,880 --> 05:16:42,720
They would have to be sending

4099
05:16:42,720 --> 05:16:45,020
so many people to collections.

4100
05:16:45,020 --> 05:16:50,250
That's why they went out of business.

4101
05:16:50,250 --> 05:16:52,849
Oh, hey, Geni, Benny, thanks for the five bucks.

4102
05:16:52,849 --> 05:16:54,770
Stream is over, that sucks.

4103
05:16:54,770 --> 05:16:57,639
Am I gonna read the TF2 comics?

4104
05:16:57,639 --> 05:17:00,889
I read them all when they originally came out.

4105
05:17:00,889 --> 05:17:02,169
This hasn't been a new TF2 comic

4106
05:17:02,169 --> 05:17:04,409
in like a couple of years, right?

4107
05:17:04,409 --> 05:17:19,450
At least a year.

4108
05:17:19,450 --> 05:17:21,930
Will you be covering Pokemon Spear and Bow

4109
05:17:21,930 --> 05:17:24,000
when it comes out?

4110
05:17:24,000 --> 05:17:28,200
Probably not.

4111
05:17:28,200 --> 05:17:29,639
I don't really play Pokemon.

4112
05:17:37,750 --> 05:17:39,150
Finally, Cremator, last bits.

4113
05:17:39,150 --> 05:17:40,150
I'll take your word for it.

4114
05:17:40,150 --> 05:17:43,000
You should try it and feel your eyes melt.

4115
05:17:43,000 --> 05:17:46,919
It's, no, no, I'm not gonna do that.

4116
05:17:46,919 --> 05:17:49,110
I'm not gonna do that.

4117
05:17:49,110 --> 05:17:56,700
They say, but don't worry, my hand's been through worse.

4118
05:17:56,700 --> 05:17:58,560
Take care of yourself.

4119
05:17:58,560 --> 05:18:03,529
It's not worth it.

4120
05:18:03,529 --> 05:18:04,450
Well, you won't be covering them

4121
05:18:04,450 --> 05:18:06,729
because they're not real.

4122
05:18:06,729 --> 05:18:11,709
Oh, it's not real.
