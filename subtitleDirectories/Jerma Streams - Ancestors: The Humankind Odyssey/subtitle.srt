1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:13,640
Stream's bopping. Stream will be bopping. Stream is currently bopping. Hey, welcome back. Hope you

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:25,530
had a good Monday. I had a good Monday. I had a great Monday. Tuesday is now. Hopefully we have a

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:37,590
good Tuesday too. Every day of the week is hopefully a good day. Today we're gonna do something I've

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,560
been looking forward to for a while since it was announced. We're gonna play Ancestors the

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:53,340
Humankind Odyssey. It's a game where you play as an ape and you have to evolve in this permadeath.

6
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:04,890
I don't know much else. I have, I'll be honest, I have read the reviews. They're very bad.

7
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:17,829
But who cares about reviews? You think I give a shit about a review? They're not great. Let's

8
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:30,379
just put it that way. You think I care? I'll review the game when I'm done. And you can trust my review

9
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:38,969
because it's from, it's from the heart and it's from the brain connected. Equal parts brain and

10
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:50,420
equal parts heart. You get the true review. But you're not gonna get that. You're gonna get me

11
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,950
playing the game for as long as it takes. There's also something I want to talk about real quick.

12
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:04,299
I want to talk about the activity book stream. Some of you know what this is. Some of you don't

13
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,500
know what this is. I have not really gone into detail on it and I'm gonna do it right now

14
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,849
because I've been pushing it off and pushing it off and I don't want to do that anymore.

15
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,530
So what is the activity? The activity book stream is going to be a stream

16
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:25,050
where some community content is made and is put into a highlights style activity book.

17
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:33,590
We're talking dot to dots. All community themed by the way. Dot to dots. Where's Waldo? Me? Well,

18
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,189
it's gonna be where's Jerma? You know, you gotta get that point across. And other random brain

19
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:46,020
teasers and activities and coloring books and shit. This is all supposed to be next week.

20
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:53,000
The deadline for submissions for this is currently the 31st. But I'm gonna move that forward because

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think that's enough time because I haven't really talked about it. It's been in the discord

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,879
for a little while. It's only in the discord. Please, if you want to submit something, which

23
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,490
it is a full submission for anybody in the community that wants to do this. There are a

24
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,810
few things that I'm going to commission out on my own. But stuff like dot to dot and if you don't

25
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,449
know what a dot to dot image is, it's when there's the template of dots and they're numbered and you

26
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,689
have to connect, you know, 123 to 100 200 whatever it is, then it makes an image. But I want to do

27
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:31,460
this thing. It seemed like a fun idea. Read the rules in the discord if you want to participate.

28
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:39,770
The new deadline for submissions for those activities is going to be, are you listening?

29
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:52,360
Are you listening? September 3rd is the last day that you can submit something. Not everything

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,960
will be chosen. We're going to choose some of the ones we think are obviously a little bit better

31
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,039
or more interesting or fun. There'll be some shitposts. Don't worry. I probably should have

32
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,479
just given the blanket statement there that you can do shitposts because I shouldn't, I don't

33
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:16,120
think I should have said that. And then the actual stream will be the 7th of September. This is not

34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,230
some huge deal, right? This is not, oh my god, this is a fucking huge stream. It's just a fun

35
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:29,420
thing I want to do. Probably take a few hours. To give more detail on some of the things,

36
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:36,060
we can do it a little bit later. I think more people are here. But I want, where's Waldo?

37
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,550
So you can make an image of, if you don't know what a where's Waldo, you kind of need to like

38
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,750
know what all these things are before making them, I guess. But there's going to be like 10 to 12

39
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,790
where's Waldo's, but it's me, 10 to 12, maybe 15 dot to dots, 10 to 12 brain teasers written by

40
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:59,370
somebody in the community, 10 to 12 jokes, 10 to 12 coloring pages. There's a whole thing in the

41
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,300
discord. Read those rules, take a look for yourself. And if you want to participate, go for it. If you

42
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:13,290
don't, then enjoy it when it happens. Now let's turn into a monkey. That sounds good to me.

43
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:30,920
Game sucks next already. No. Ancestors. This game is going to be wild. It's going to be intense.

44
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,879
You're probably going to see a couple of like, I'm probably going to be like, fuck. At one point,

45
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:43,899
I just want to warn everybody for the bad language coming up here. Because there is permadeath.

46
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,180
I want, do you think I can get through this whole thing without dying? Absolutely not.

47
00:05:49,819 --> 00:06:03,300
Here we go. You're going to see a couple of fails. Lineage name. This is the name of all

48
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:12,839
through history. So we've got to think back like 60 million years ago, like a hundred million years

49
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:23,750
ago. Were there any Elbertsons back then? No, guys, they were no Elbertsons. Elbertson is a

50
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:31,529
European name. It means guy who makes shoes. I was like, my family is like the shoe blacksmith.

51
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:46,970
So I, there's no way. Write it. Why can I not write this? Lineage name. Can I not type a name?

52
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:02,680
Why can I not name this? Lineage name. Why can't I type in here? No, there's something going on.

53
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:13,939
Something weird. There we go. Right? Yes. I can't. I'm just going to be the Elbertsons.

54
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:21,100
This is where it started. My family's been making shoes for millions of years.

55
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,850
Choose your game experience first time. What do you mean? How could you do a second time? Explore,

56
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,569
expand, and evolve by experimenting what our oldest ancestors had to face.

57
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,649
Player help. Choose the level of assistance. Full HUD, full tutorial.

58
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:51,370
Full HUD, no tutorial. Minimal HUD, full tutorial. No HUD, no tutorial.

59
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:04,680
How am I supposed to play the game? I'm not doing that. Full HUD, full tutorial. How about,

60
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:12,060
how about minimal HUD, full, I'm, no, I have to do this like minimal HUD, full tutorial. Okay,

61
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:21,220
that sounds okay. You guys are going to have to help me here. No balls. That's fine.

62
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:44,980
Minimal HUD, full tutorial. We're just going to go random. Got it. Here we go. Lineage Elbertsons,

63
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,460
game mode, first time, settlement, hidden waterfall oasis, female, clan size, medium.

64
00:08:51,460 --> 00:09:00,360
I didn't get to pick my clan. Here we go. Mama Elbertson is going to take us home here.

65
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:22,299
Here it is. The first ever human to ever be recorded. Inspired by true events. All right.

66
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,460
You can't, you can't say that. I don't think that's... The world and characters you will

67
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,460
encounter are meant to represent archetypes of a place and of a moment, not the exact depiction.

68
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,220
This adventure was made by Panache Digital Games, which is composed of all these people

69
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,399
based on a true story. Yeah, but we don't know. They didn't write this stuff down.

70
00:09:48,120 --> 00:10:00,679
You can't say based on a true story, based on a bone. With the help of... They did.

71
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,519
In the following hours, you will relive the challenges of the dawn of humanity.

72
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,120
Based on a true bone, embark into the never-ending odyssey of human progression on this planet.

73
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,409
Use your body, senses, mind, and voice to guide your voyages. Gain strength in numbers and advance

74
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:27,419
the species. Survive the elements. Teach your family. Build a home. Make sure to watch your

75
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:37,370
food and thirst meters. We won't help you very much. And remember, evolution is not set in stone.

76
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:47,289
It is your path to forge. This is very loud. Yes. Where am I? Do I land on like a comet?

77
00:10:48,090 --> 00:11:01,509
This is how it started. We crash landed on fucking comets. Let's be... Got it. First try. Ah,

78
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,700
fuck, I dropped it. It's all right. There's probably more of those. That's probably the currency.

79
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:26,409
Watch out! Look at all these animals. They have every animal. Wait, was this... weren't they dinosaurs?

80
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:42,100
This is supposed to be like 500 million years ago. All right, well then that guy's got like...

81
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:53,610
Uh-oh, watch out. Here comes the... It's the Jaguar thing. Jaguars attacked alligators? They did?

82
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,129
No, they didn't. Based on one true bone. They dug up a bone and now they can tell me that

83
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:12,139
that panther attacked that alligator. I don't think so. Where do we start? Ancestors with

84
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:21,529
human kind arms. Eventually, you'll be working in a fucking office. Volume one, before us.

85
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:52,740
Okay. Is this us? This is us. All right. We got the fish. We got to eat it. Watch out for the bird!

86
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:12,169
Holy shit. Okay. Regain safety in a hiding spot or in your clan's... What the fuck is

87
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:20,389
going on? Why are they like specters? Tap Y to use your intelligence. Use to identify a hiding spot,

88
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:28,070
your clan settlement, or other practical items. What? I'm a baby. Okay, so this is intelligence.

89
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:35,529
Don't move to stay in intelligence. Look around. Right stick to highlight point of interest,

90
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,289
then follow the steps displayed on the contextual UI. So, okay, over there.

91
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:53,750
Right? Go towards the square. All right, let's go towards the square. Why are these all these

92
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:16,389
like nightmare images? What do you mean? I can't like drown. Now what do you want me to do? Yeah,

93
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:36,440
I know a hiding spot. Latibolum. Oh, all right. How do I sprint? How do you punch? Dude, why do

94
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:45,370
they keep doing this? I don't want to see anymore of these weird like 3D animations. There it is.

95
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:52,789
All right, I found it. Sense of hearing. Don't move to stay in the senses. This is the representation

96
00:14:52,789 --> 00:15:11,509
of the sounds within range. Look around to target a sound. What? Minimal fucking tutorial,

97
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:21,669
minimal HUD. I found the hiding spot. It's right here. It said look around for the sound and then

98
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:42,980
what did it want me to do? What is that? Another... another person? What is that? Food? Current clan

99
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:53,690
settlement. Okay, well, let's... let me go into the hiding spot. Am I hiding? Is this a hiding spot?

100
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,629
Grabbing foliage and creepers. Jump and hold A to grab the foliage or the creepers when press

101
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,590
passing through it. Trunks, branches, and rock walls are... what the hell is that next to me?

102
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:14,389
That's me. Okay, well, I fucking didn't even see what it was. Is it up here? Should I get up here?

103
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:35,769
No, look, this is right there. Hiding spot. How do I get in this hiding spot? How do I get in this?

104
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:51,860
Okay, that was... I clearly was... I did it. Find the lost child of your clan. What do you mean?

105
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:04,059
Sprint L... L to move. Hold A to sprint. Release A to jump. All right. What do you mean find the

106
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:12,220
lost baby? To cancel jump. Stop moving before releasing A. Okay, well, I... I just grabbed

107
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,500
something. I just grabbed like a stick. All right, I got a stick in my hands. I'm ready to fight.

108
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:32,619
Growing Neuron. Who are these people? Are these friends? All right, it said we won't tell you

109
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:41,269
anything, so I just have flowers in my hands. What am I supposed to be doing? Look at all these

110
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:49,579
things. Okay, what about over here? Don't know what this is. My intelligence is gaining

111
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,819
because I looked over here at like the briar patch. I know what that is now, apparently. Hold on.

112
00:17:54,619 --> 00:18:13,210
Is that the baby crying? Tap X to use your senses to help you locate any member of your clan.

113
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:26,569
Okay. Down there. All right, I gotta be careful. Can I... I'm coming to save you.

114
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,190
That was scary. I'm not gonna lie. All right, how do I get down from here?

115
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:54,970
What? I couldn't even read that. What did it say? Spring... Got you. Okay. Tap B, then wait for the

116
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,690
answers to progressively comfort the kid. Lower the temperature. Take the time to listen. What the

117
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:31,000
fuck are you talking about? Why are we doing this? It's me! Oh, thank goodness. So that's...

118
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,710
Is this me? Which one is me? Join your clan in the settlement. All right. So here's the thing. How

119
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,779
do you swing and how do you climb? The tutorial was on the screen for five seconds. Can I look

120
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:55,670
at tutorials? Adult, female, single, fertile. Okay, hold on. Options, controls, intelligence,

121
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:11,829
emotions, concentrations, emotions. It didn't tell me anything. All right. I don't know how

122
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:22,579
to grab a vine. All right. Let's listen. Let's see. Where was the settlement again? Let me zoom in.

123
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:31,099
Let me just take a look at some stuff over here. What is this? You don't know. Right. Okay. I don't

124
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:43,849
know what's over there. Where was my settlement? It's up here, right? There it is. All right. So

125
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:55,819
get up there. Up that way. Up this tree. Here we go. Is this like... Can I jump higher and grab?

126
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:11,690
No. I have to just hold. Motricity? Motricity? How can I go? I wish I knew how to actually hold

127
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:26,230
on to stuff. Do you even need to? Maybe you don't even need to. All right. I made it. Back in the

128
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:52,539
settlement. I could do this pretty well. Which one's me and which one's the game? That was the game.

129
00:21:53,180 --> 00:22:14,839
What's going on here? What's going on? Why are we... Can your lineage evolve faster than our

130
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:28,039
ancestors did? I don't know. Can they? Avatar's vitality. Energy is limited by stamina, is limited

131
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:34,200
by life expectancy. Eat well, drink well, and sleep well to maintain a great stamina. Avoid injuries

132
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:42,250
and stay on the screen for more than 10 seconds. Stop moving to see all the contextual actions

133
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:51,220
offered. They vary according to your situation. Contextual actions. All right. Well, now what do

134
00:22:51,220 --> 00:23:08,579
I do? Can I drink out of the stream? How do you drink? Okay. No, that's like... That's the taunt

135
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,569
button. Wait. Hold on. What? There's so many things to look at. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

136
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,940
What? Okay. When already discovered, dropped items can be stockpiled with identical items.

137
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:31,140
What are you talking about? I hit right bumper. Fucking minimal HUD. All right. So we can... You

138
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:39,160
grab with A. Hold X to inspect any item you have in the right hand. That's good to know. What is it?

139
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,960
How do I know what this is? I don't know what it is. This is just a green thing to me.

140
00:23:45,779 --> 00:24:03,210
New food. Horsetail. How do I eat it? Just like corn on the cob.

141
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,299
Adaptable metabolism. Assimilated nutrients from the vegeta- vegetal kind of food.

142
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:19,660
How much do I have to eat? How much green corn do we have to eat? Oh, I'm teaching them. I get it.

143
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,339
See? Everyone, this is how you eat food. You pick it up and you eat it.

144
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:41,049
Okay. I learned communication. I'm going to learn how to talk. What else is there? Oh, can I eat this

145
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:54,700
too? Is this food? Examine. What could this be used for? What do you think? New tool. Grass sci-cad. New

146
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,660
tool. What can I use this with though? How do I use this? There's something over there. Take a shit

147
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,579
in the river. I'm glad- I'm glad that's what you want me to do. Oh, what's happening?

148
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,779
What is that? Why does he have lasers coming out of his mouth? Hold on. Wait. Come here.

149
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:30,440
What's this? Something over here. New species of fruit. What is it? Pick it up. What am I doing?

150
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:44,779
What's in here? Why can this be examined? Oh, am I drinking? How do I drink? How do you drink water?

151
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:51,509
Examine the water. I have to examine it. Oh, yes. I can drink this.

152
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,089
Aqua dulcis orego. Isn't it just- that's not it. It's H2O. It's hydrogen and oxygen. Twice.

153
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:18,089
All right. Let's go. How do I feed the kid? What's this stuff? Oh, berries. Are they poisonous?

154
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:37,660
Will I know? Poisonous berries? New food. This is going to poison me. No, I did. Okay. I guess we

155
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,220
can't eat these. We can eat these. Guys, we can eat these. Come over here. We can eat these berries.

156
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:52,329
Although, they might be poisonous. Should I not have taught them how to do this?

157
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:04,759
Wait. Wait. Don't eat them. Don't eat them. Stop eating those. I can't be for certain. I have to

158
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:15,210
wait until I have diarrhea. Okay. Something's wrong with me. I think I'm cold. I'm sorry.

159
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:28,900
I think we have to test it somehow. Okay. Don't eat those. Well, whoever that is,

160
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:35,990
we might not last very long. What's this? I'm gonna make a shelter. All right. Can I hold it

161
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:49,500
over his head? I just gave that to him? No. Having children nearby allows the accumulation of

162
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:58,359
neuronal energy. More children means increased accumulation. Turn the HUD on. I don't think I can.

163
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,410
Oh, fuck. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Vitality,

164
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,660
injuring, and poisoning. Poisoning comes from venom or by eating rotten or green food,

165
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:19,140
or by ingesting of toxic elements. When poisoned, find something with medicinal properties. Okay.

166
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,019
So I've been poisoned. Your organism can't assimilate nutrients from all kinds of food

167
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:30,230
right away. Some may cause a temporary poisoning. You can become omnivorous through neuronal

168
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:38,789
development. Okay. Attack. Hold A to prime dodging. Move to dodge.

169
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Release A at the right time. Hold A to prime the counter attack. What the fuck do you mean? All

170
00:28:45,960 --> 00:29:00,900
right. Let's just let's go look around. Everybody get over here. Don't be out there. A sleeping

171
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,940
spot. When built, a sleep spot is at the basis of every settlement. Tap A to lie down on a sleep

172
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:15,289
spot. Let me examine that as a sleep spot. There it is. All right. So I got it on the UI now.

173
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:32,730
I got it examined. Let's see what it does. And let's sleep. Can I go to bed? How long does it

174
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:52,730
take to go to sleep? Go to bed. Baby. Baby with spontaneous genetic mutation metabolism.

175
00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:07,819
How do I turn the fucking HUD on? Yeah, I'm sorry. That ain't gonna happen. This is staying on.

176
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm not gonna play. Let me learn the game first. Jesus. All right. Let's see. So I got

177
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:27,609
changed. So it's like Path of Exile. Okay, so here I am. Neuronal growth is complete.

178
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:33,509
Assign neuronal energy to initiate a new communication skill. Assign neuronal

179
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:44,059
energy to initiate a new motor skill. All right. I think I want some motor skills. The ability to

180
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:52,950
switch hands with an item is acquired. Tap LB to switch hands with an item. Nice. That has opened

181
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,480
up so many more things. All right. I can switch hands. Wow. What a development. What about down

182
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,140
here? Let's do some more communication. Okay. The ability to gather all clan members is acquired.

183
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:21,180
Hold B to gather all clan members and have them follow you. Okay. This looks huge. To launch an

184
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:26,380
evolution, you must be in your clan's active settlement. You've passed at least one generation

185
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:33,779
and succeeded in evolutionary feat. Okay. So I haven't done that yet. All right. So let's go to

186
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:44,539
That's it. We slept. We now can hold something in our other hand. Analyze. Baby. Love. This

187
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:57,259
spontaneous genetic. All right. Rename. New name. Yeah. Change name. Change name. No. I want to

188
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:20,599
baby you. All right. Let's go. Let's try it. Everybody get over here. Who are you? All right.

189
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm going to rename you as well. Tweet. Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. New

190
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:42,019
Kaiser for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Appreciate it. How do I pick you up? Isn't this

191
00:32:42,019 --> 00:33:05,529
my baby? Sleep. Sleep. Why is the time going so fast? What is that? Am I having a dream?

192
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:12,420
Oh yeah. Yesterday I looked at my hand. I have something outside of my arm that looks weird.

193
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:22,180
It's got five things on it. Dawn. All right. Let's get up at eight o'clock in the morning.

194
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:34,339
Here we go. Food. Water. Daily regimen update. I need some water. All right. Let's go. Everybody

195
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:40,380
come over here. Let's all drink water please. Everybody come over into the pond. Let's drink

196
00:33:40,380 --> 00:34:02,710
some water. All of you. Come on. Together. Over here. All of you. See? How much is too much water?

197
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:10,889
We don't want to get over hydrated. All right. That's good. What about food? How am I doing on

198
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:18,679
food? Handling. Tap to switch hand. It will free the right hand to pick up something else.

199
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:28,010
All right. Here we go. Alter. What do you mean alter? Oh right. Some items may be altered with

200
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:47,849
bare hands or crafted. What? What am I doing? Oh picking the leaves off. All right. Dexterity.

201
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:23,739
Okay. Let's try it again. Should I do that again? How many times should I do this? Is there

202
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:37,849
anymore leaves to pull? This has to do something eventually, right? What? I don't know what this

203
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:52,679
is even for. What's this for? I don't understand. I don't know. I need. We need food. Food. Food.

204
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,389
Follow me. Everybody follow me. We gotta get food. Where's the food? Over here. What's that? Cold?

205
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:10,840
Okay. Wait. Hold on. Food. Is this food? Can I eat this? No. I can't eat this. Back to the

206
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:35,750
poison berries. Food. Found it. It's all mine. It's all mine. I'm the clan leader. Okay. Let's

207
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:46,599
analyze. Let's go. I want to go. Let's go somewhere. How about what's that? Identify. Memorize. The

208
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,599
location of anything you have identified can be memorized. There we go. Intelligence can also be

209
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,010
used to discover practical items and to visualize the things you have identified. Nice. All right.

210
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:22,199
That's so much better. So what's in here? I memorized this. I don't understand. All right.

211
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,460
I'm going. I gotta. I'm gonna go find. Wait. Food. Over here. Grain on the cob. Over here.

212
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:48,659
So what's wrong with me? What's my. I'm still like having problems. Where are the kids?

213
00:37:49,539 --> 00:38:09,639
You. Come here. Okay. A rock. A stick. New tool. Dead branch. All right. Let's analyze it.

214
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:27,820
What am I doing? I'm just cutting my hand. Build a computer. I don't think I can. Well,

215
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,659
I want to pick up the rock. Rock. No. Rock. I saw the rock right on the ground. Right here.

216
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:48,409
Got it. All right. Rock. You can smash stuff with this. Okay. Granite rock. Can I do anything else

217
00:38:48,409 --> 00:39:02,659
with this? Eat the rock. I think. I think the rock is funny. We learned comedy. All right. Can I like.

218
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:18,260
Uh. It makes a scratching noise. That's all this does. I'm trying to break a rock and

219
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:25,349
my hands. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stick. Okay. Wait. I have two rocks. I've got

220
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:45,820
two rocks. If I hit rocks together. That makes a fire. Eventually. Fuck. Wait. Give me. Wait.

221
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:56,500
Give me the branch. Okay. Rock. No. Get rid of the rock. I don't want two rocks. Branch. Okay. I've

222
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:06,860
got rock and branch. No. Pick the fucking rock up. You idiot. Okay. Here we go. Rock and branch.

223
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:23,559
Rock to branch doesn't do anything. I don't think. Shit. Branch and. There. Take this rock.

224
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:52,119
Hold and wait for the audio cue. Oh, we like each other. Okay. Copy paste. Tell them. Somebody

225
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,760
tell them. Wait. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

226
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:14,739
Oh. All right. Okay. So you said hold. So let's get it in the right hand. Alter. Wait for the

227
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:50,360
audio cue. Here we go. Ready? No. Stop. Stop. Give me this. Give me the other rock. Okay. I'm. Here

228
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:59,909
we go. Do I have things in my hands? Okay. Switch hands. Alter. Let's go. Listen for the cue.

229
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:22,360
Okay. It's like a camera sound. Okay. Am I making like a spear or a knife or a weapon?

230
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:36,250
Okay. I've got it. I've got something. Now what do I do with this? Switch hands. Can I just

231
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:52,059
hit somebody with this? Is it not? It's a sword now. Okay. Inspect it. Okay. It's a sword. Here.

232
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:59,960
You can have this. Let's trade. I'll trade you a stick for a rock. Thank you. I've got two rocks.

233
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:27,369
Discovered new alteration. Hitting. A granite rock can alter a granite rock. Wow. That's real

234
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:44,460
scientific. No. Look at the other ones. Switch hands. Stare at that. Take that in. Yeah. It's

235
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:56,460
new. It's a new experience. New tool. Granite grinder. Okay. I've got a grinder. So let me drop

236
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:07,769
the... No. Where's the grinder? Okay. I've got the grinder in my hand. Now let's grind.

237
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:37,880
Something over here. Should I grind this? All right. I'm gonna grind this. It's not burning.

238
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:46,860
Oh, wait. Okay. What if I put it over here? Construction. Some items can lead to construction

239
00:44:46,860 --> 00:45:00,619
possibilities when in a stockpile. All right. Hold on. No. No. No. Let's get some more leaves.

240
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:20,420
Everybody. Grab a leaf. Grab one of these. Okay. Let's put it down. All right. We're starting to

241
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:55,110
build a house. Should I grind this? No. That's not gonna work. Give me that rock. I need that rock

242
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:01,000
back. Here. I'm gonna put this over here. This is our... Give me another rock. This is a bigger rock.

243
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:14,659
Okay. Give me a stick again. What's going on here? What's going on? Why are they holding their

244
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:32,500
throats? Okay. This is scent. Okay. Let's go. This is a new rock. Okay. This is obsidian. Wait.

245
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:48,599
Obsidian and... This is flammable, isn't it? This is my grinder. I've got obsidian. Here we go.

246
00:46:52,139 --> 00:47:09,030
Is this gonna explode in my hands? Shit. Wait. Can I take... Where's my obsidian? Okay. Give me

247
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:15,590
the obsidian. Remember, that's my grinding stone. All right. Give me the stick. I'm gonna put the...

248
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:35,340
I'm gonna put the obsidian on the stick. I think. Obsidian is volcanic glass. Yeah. I'm gonna

249
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:43,670
attach it to the front and I'm gonna throw it through the jungle at somebody. Why did I

250
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:56,659
just do that? Oh shit. It's getting late. All I've done is hit stuff with rocks. Hitting. An obsidian

251
00:47:56,659 --> 00:48:12,570
can alter a dead branch. Shit. We gotta go to bed. Wait. Let me look at this. Was it... I don't

252
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:19,929
understand 2100. Stick. Okay. Just leave that there for tomorrow. You just hang out. All right.

253
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:34,760
Let's go to bed. All right. Good night. I learned some new stuff. Assign to initiate how dexterity

254
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:51,059
will improve. Ooh. EU has an increased capacity to metabolize food. Let's get it. Item manipulation.

255
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:55,610
The ability to switch an item from one hand to the other while moving is acquired. So I can...

256
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:06,179
That's... Who cares? I can switch hands while moving. That's... Who gives a shit? Well,

257
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:22,170
we can keep going. Now what? Once connected, it would be possible to drop an item while moving.

258
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:31,639
All right. Well, connect it. What are you doing? Why? You can't go that far? Why can't... I don't

259
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:39,880
have enough brain power. Okay. Well, I can do things while moving now. I think that's all I

260
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:47,210
can do. All right. Let's sleep. Everybody go to bed. Good night. We have to... We gotta move to a new

261
00:49:47,210 --> 00:50:00,739
settlement, right? There's only day three. Oh. We're learning how to stand... How to rest.

262
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:10,119
How to... We're doing charades. Okay. Sleeping. Tired. I need... Especially... I need... Wait,

263
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:16,599
wait, wait. Okay. Here, here, here. Stuff, stuff, stuff. Water. Really? There's water right here.

264
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:26,820
Why is everybody so fucking thirsty? Everybody over here. He's holding a stick. Have you figured

265
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:39,880
out what to do with the stick yet? I don't know what to do. You need to drink the water. This is

266
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:50,699
not drinking water, is it? He's gonna become the alpha. No, he's not. I'll do some diabolical

267
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,059
villain shit where if it looks like he's starting to pass me, I'll just fucking put... I'll just,

268
00:50:54,059 --> 00:51:13,179
I'll just like cut his vineys on when he's swinging around. Yeah, so that's fucking diabolical.

269
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:23,179
Let me go. I'm gonna go explore. Are we well fed? I think we are. He's figuring... Uh-oh. I think I...

270
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:29,349
No, no, no. I think here's what happened. I handed him that stick yesterday and he still doesn't know

271
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:34,389
what to do with it. Let me show him. Look. Ready? Look at me. Look, look, look, look at me. Look at

272
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:41,349
my eyes. Look at me. Get a rock. You got a stick too? They're all, they're all holding sticks. All

273
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:56,739
right. We need rocks. What's this? Just hold on. I know, I know what I'm doing. I'm the fucking alpha.

274
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:16,179
We need a rock. Where's the rock? Did you guys hoard the rocks? All right. I'm going for it.

275
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:24,949
Let's go. What do we got? We have some points of interest. Nothing too... No, no, no. You know what?

276
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:32,920
I'm gonna do this first. It's focusing on this. What is that? Okay. That's just grass. I don't

277
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:41,800
even know that. What about over here? It's just grass. Don't need to memorize it. That's the same

278
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:49,239
shit we had already. Anything else? There's water? What about down here? What's that? I don't know

279
00:52:49,239 --> 00:53:09,210
what that is. We're gonna find out. What is it? Look at it. Scoop. No, no, no. Look. I want you

280
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:20,730
to look at the patches. Phylactery Lich just gave 50 dollars. Thank you for the 50 bucks Phylactery.

281
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,289
I can't wait for Jerma to extinct the human rice by shoving every food he finds directly in his

282
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:38,760
mouth. I'm not gonna do that. Don't worry. How do I look at this? How do I examine it? But thanks

283
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,570
to the 50 fucking dollars dude, seriously. On top of the insane amount of money we've already given.

284
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:57,369
Don't fall. What's that? What was that? Do I need, I need to like hit this with something? All right.

285
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:01,210
Don't fall down the waterfall. To like, you know, laugh out loud he fell down the waterfall. I'm

286
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:06,630
not gonna do that. Let's look at this one more time. They throw, they throw any branches. Yeah,

287
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:18,739
well they're on the mini map. Okay. I'm going over here. Memorize it. Remember it. Pay attention to

288
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:25,940
it. How do you climb? It's probably, it's important for me to know how to climb. Because it was on

289
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:31,699
the screen for five seconds and it was off. All right, so movement. Swinging and jumping. Stop

290
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:38,420
moving left stick before releasing A to cancel a jump. Left stick to swing. Hold A to prime a jump.

291
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,260
Release A to jump. Jump then hold A to grab foliage or the creepers when passing through it.

292
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:55,900
So you just hold A and then you let go of the left stick and you let go of A. I, yes. I'm not

293
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,659
gonna go this way. Everyone expects me to do the thing where oh the streamer fucking fell down the

294
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:10,489
waterfall and I laughed and it was not funny. Not today. Today we're going exploring. This is

295
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:38,570
sound. No, this is smell. Something stinks over there. Let me take a look. Oh my god. Okay. Oh my

296
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:48,539
god. Okay, we're fine. He fell down. All right, I gotta be careful. Let me see if there's anything

297
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:57,500
out here. Hold on. Be careful. There's some smelly things over here. We're hearing something going

298
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:13,590
on on the right side. I hear something over there. There are some sounds. Rock. New rock or the same?

299
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:27,059
Okay, should I carry the rock in my hand? Okay, I'm gonna smash somebody's head with a rock if I see

300
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:45,639
anybody. Gotta head that way. What's going on? What's wrong with me? What is that? Oh, those are,

301
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:50,309
those are my, those are my plants. Something can see me? I don't know what can see me right now.

302
00:56:50,309 --> 00:57:15,219
This is freaking me out. Smell. What do I smell? There ain't nothing here. That's a rival? Is that

303
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:20,900
a rival monkey? I don't think it is. I think that's one of my friends, isn't it? He does have a stick

304
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:41,849
in his hand. This is my friend, right? There's a snake. Where? Where is there a snake? I don't see

305
00:57:41,849 --> 00:58:02,579
a snake. All right, communication upgraded. I don't, there's no snake. We're fine. All right,

306
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:10,380
everybody come with me. Follow me, guys. We need to get over there. And there's berries over here.

307
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:25,619
I'm a professional. Don't fuck around. All right, there it is. Berries. Is it, is it berries?

308
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:37,690
That was fucking close. All right, we're almost there.

309
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:47,059
I need to get some vantage so I can take a look around. There's a new tree up here or something.

310
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:58,789
This is new. All right, guys. New. Everybody up. Take it. Smell it. Get it in your hands.

311
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:16,420
Alert. Alert. Alert. Alert. Why is there an alert? It's a pig. Oh shit. Somebody get a rock.

312
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:26,329
Does anybody have a rock? I do. No, give me the rock. Do I have the rock?

313
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:40,489
Okay, I got a rock. Where'd he go? Here. I think we're okay. I need to examine

314
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:55,849
this shit though. This is something new. Is it edible? New food. Caught. Eat it. Wait,

315
00:59:55,849 --> 01:00:18,900
no, no, no. No, you got, don't eat it yet. Let me test it. Is it good? All right, we've all eaten.

316
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:45,099
Should I chop the tree down? Oh, no, you guys don't eat it all. Okay, analyze. I now know what that

317
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:52,329
looks like. Let's stand still. Let's smell. No, we got, that's where I want to go. Let's smell,

318
01:00:52,329 --> 01:01:00,309
though. Let's just make sure. Not missing anything. Listening for something too.

319
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:05,340
Oh, I can hear you guys. Stop screaming. All right, we're good. Maybe one more for the road.

320
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:15,420
Kill the pig. We don't know how to use weapons. I can barely teach these guys how to throw a rock.

321
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:22,840
I don't know anything else. No, the mission is still the same. Get to this question mark. Identify

322
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,960
it. Memorize it. Get over there. There's something over there we need to investigate on. All right,

323
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:53,849
easy. Here we go. Hello? Is that guy on my team? I don't get it. All right, this is where the baby

324
01:01:53,849 --> 01:02:00,519
was. Anything else we need to see over here? Oh, wait. Might as well take a look at it. Get

325
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:31,780
it in your brain. This is a hiding place. What? Hello? Is it above us? Where is it? Is it over

326
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:54,820
there? Where is this thing? Whatever it is, it's that way. What is it? Is it a snake?

327
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:19,050
Oh, it's a snake. Oh, shoot. Kill it. Kill the snake.

328
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:28,699
Fight it. Uh-oh. Hold A to prime dodging. Move left stick to choose direction. Release at the

329
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:50,250
right time. Okay. I'm poisoned. Drink water. Intimidate. Why did I chase it? I don't know

330
01:03:50,250 --> 01:04:05,429
because I figured we were all gonna fucking stop them. Drink it. Drink the water. Drink the water.

331
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:16,840
Please. Drink the water. Oh, God. I need a healing plant. Somebody help, please. Medicinal? What's

332
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:33,619
that? Hiding spot. No. I need a medicinal plant. I don't know what's over there, but let's find out.

333
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:58,630
Hurry up. All right. What's this? Is this wheat? It's wheat. New gathering spot. Fishing spot.

334
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:10,940
No, I'm still poisoned. What like heals poison? What? What? Huh? Fear of the unknown. Use your

335
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:16,420
senses and intelligence to identify what's around you. Fear and dopamine is needed to...

336
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:34,789
Dopamine is needed to avoid hysteria when in fear. Oh, fuck. It's another snake. Is that the same

337
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:52,489
snake? Everybody get over here. Strength in numbers. Give me that thing. All right. I need...

338
01:05:53,449 --> 01:06:04,440
Snake still here? All right. I'm out. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Climb. Climb. Climb. Climb.

339
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,480
Don't. Just don't. No, no, no, no. Get it. Just get... What the fuck is that?

340
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:21,750
What? I thought it was a snake. Oh, my God. It's a lion. Get out of the way. Get up on the tree.

341
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:27,190
Climb. Oh, he's looking at me. Why is he looking at me? Why is he looking at me? Why is he looking

342
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:39,739
at me? Why is he looking at me? Get up here. He can't climb. Okay. What am I supposed to do?

343
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:49,460
He can't get up there. It's like the three stooges. He can't get up. He can't get up. He

344
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:56,360
can't get up. Come on. All the way up. What's wrong with me? Why? Where am I going?

345
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,420
I'm not in control. I'm not in control.

346
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:41,769
Did I just knock myself out? I have no idea. Am I still poisoned? What happened?

347
01:07:47,849 --> 01:08:05,900
I put my head so hard that I cured the poison. What is in my hand? New food? A giant African snail.

348
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:30,069
When did I pick up a snail? Nutrients from the mollusk kind of food. I'm still poisoned.

349
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:45,239
Dammit. All right. I need to fight. I need to learn how to fight. I need to lie down first,

350
01:08:45,239 --> 01:09:03,220
I think. How did I even get back here? I need to lie down. I'm gonna sleep off the poison.

351
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:18,840
I'm good. You died? This is a different monkey. Why is this one? Wait, did we all get bit by the

352
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:24,840
snake or something? Wait, this is a different... This is different. Wait a minute. Hold on. Is

353
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:46,539
this still you? Who's on me? Wait, this is not me? Partnered with Book. Oh, okay. I can't even,

354
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:56,539
man. I need to learn some new abilities. There we are. All right. You're supposed to just die

355
01:09:56,539 --> 01:10:01,829
because there's no way you can survive. All right. Handling. What about what just opened up down

356
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:09,239
here? More communication. Self-empowerment. Once connected, clan members will have the capacity

357
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:15,159
to automatically mimic an intimidation or the action of conquering fear. Get down there.

358
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:28,439
I need you guys to be independent. Good. All right. What about this generation? The past

359
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:31,800
generation was being an adult, being your clan's active settlement, and the clan must have at

360
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:44,340
least one kid. Okay, so we need... We got more shit here to do. So this is generational. Switch

361
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,899
an item from... So this means that new... Wait, does this person not know how to do anything?

362
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:15,779
Shit. Okay. Generational. Item manipulation. So what about... This is reinforce. So the new

363
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:22,470
monkeys will know that. So this is ensuring that the next generation will know. Okay.

364
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:30,220
This... I mean, that's fairly important, I think. All right. Let's go. I need to go... We need to

365
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:35,300
go to sleep. This time, I ain't gonna do anything till I fucking learn how to make like a weapon.

366
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:57,449
Why am I having a dream of the hyenas? All right. It's 8 a.m. Let's go.

367
01:11:58,789 --> 01:12:09,029
We're good. Sleep, food, water. Everyone's healthy. Let's get this going. I was on an

368
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:18,779
expedition. We're not gonna do... It's too dangerous. Where is my stuff? I have like a rock over here.

369
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:24,710
This is... It was my grinding rock. Let me... I'm gonna build a little thing first. Here's a rock.

370
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:41,180
Give me a stick. Stick of some sort. Something like that. Here we go. Drop the babies. I get

371
01:12:41,180 --> 01:13:02,149
extra points if I have a baby with me. Let's alter it. What the hell? Shit. I missed the

372
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:20,180
opportunity. Hold on. Alter it. New stripping. Okay. Now a grass can be modified. All right.

373
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:27,380
Now let's take a look at that. What do you think about this? Is it... Can I hit somebody with this

374
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:43,420
thing maybe? Okay. Stem. Stem and... I don't know. Just eat it. Enchant it. Now can I do something

375
01:13:43,420 --> 01:14:08,439
with the rock? No. You made a butt scratcher. That's not gonna do anything. I need the... I need

376
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:20,739
like leaves. I need... Give me... I need a... Come here. Put my stuff over here. I need one of those

377
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:32,260
sticks. Give me the rock. I'm gonna make a stick and then I'm gonna take the stone and I'm gonna

378
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:45,779
make something else with it. Smash it up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't throw it. Don't. I had to

379
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:59,720
let go and it's gone. That was obsidian. I don't know where it is now. Okay. So there we go. I don't

380
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:07,289
even need the rock anymore. Well, I do now. Okay. So you can just strip it. Now what happens if I

381
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:21,560
take an obsidian rock and I smash them together? I'm sharpening the end. Just learned how to make

382
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:52,090
a weapon and I'm gonna make like... What happened? Who died? Okay. Well, I don't know. It just

383
01:15:52,090 --> 01:16:20,699
happened. Come on. Come on. Keep it going. New alteration. An obsidian can alter a stick.

384
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:29,369
And now this stick can be used. Use the obsidian as a tool at least twice. Switch up the hands.

385
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:46,199
Take a look at the weapon and learn. Pointy means pain. Ow. Sharp. Blood. Sharpened stick. Good.

386
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:54,140
I now have a weapon. I am ready. I am gonna actually give this to you.

387
01:16:55,180 --> 01:17:09,859
Come here. I want you to take this. Learn. Take that. Why is everybody choking?

388
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:18,100
Here. Take this item. Good. Now you have the pointy stick and we're gonna make like three of these.

389
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:39,350
He's dying. He's not dying. Oh, I'm eating bugs. What happens when I get this to level two?

390
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:57,130
All right. Couple. Couple? Should we make some more children? Wow. I have two kids. There's two kids

391
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:10,170
on me. Okay. Ig. Coupled with Ku. All right. Good. Make sure you take that stick with you.

392
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:25,909
You're gonna be fine. Stop like... What are you choking on? Analyze. Yeah, you're fine. All right.

393
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:41,510
We're gonna make babies. You and I. Here. Eat this. Eat it.

394
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:48,489
Well, never mind. Here. Somebody else eat this. All right. Now it's time. I'm gonna make a couple

395
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:55,939
more sticks. We need to have some... some form of defense. I'm not gonna walk around the jungle

396
01:18:55,939 --> 01:19:19,430
without anything. It's that. Grab the rock. Let's make another sharp stick. Do the rock and obsidian

397
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:27,819
next. You don't know how to use them. Can I just like stab somebody with this so we know what happens?

398
01:19:28,779 --> 01:19:38,279
Like I can't just walk into somebody with this and just stab them through like the chest.

399
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:49,100
And everyone would be like... and they'll know that it's... that it does that. Oh my god. I'm a

400
01:19:49,100 --> 01:20:25,050
fucking idiot. I'm gonna put this down. Water. Why am I afraid of the water? Does phobia get passed

401
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:55,340
down from generation to generation in this game? I'm good. Got a stick. Put this down. Now put the

402
01:20:55,340 --> 01:21:04,170
stick down because I need to drink water. All right. Everybody get over here. Water, guys.

403
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:20,680
Everybody in. Look what I'm doing. Do what I'm doing. Why you have to... food, water,

404
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:32,520
didn't we learn this already? Everybody in the water. Follow me in here. In the water.

405
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:50,090
In the water. You can do it. Very good. All of you now. I know I'm gonna move because you're

406
01:21:50,090 --> 01:22:05,210
not gonna do it. In here. Get in the water. Why won't he come in the water? Look. Okay.

407
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:12,199
Do I need to teach you everything? Yes, apparently I do. Do we even have any more food?

408
01:22:13,939 --> 01:22:25,369
Stab him. No. I need to... okay. I need... where's my food? Where's food? Hold on. He's like...

409
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:46,489
is food over here, right? Right here. Come here. Everybody over here right now. I'm going blind?

410
01:22:46,489 --> 01:23:19,819
What? Eat it. Good job. Finally. Can we drink in here now? Good. I can't... I cannot have...

411
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:31,340
I can't have sex right now, guys. All right. You got a stick. I got a stick. That should be good.

412
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:43,369
Everyone's eaten. Everyone's drank. Let's go. Where's my stick? There it is. Give me my stick.

413
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:51,060
I don't know how to use it, but I might be able to like accidentally hit something with this. All

414
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:59,260
right. Let's try this again. I want to go somewhere close. I don't know what... I don't know what this

415
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,100
is, but I... wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I hit it? I think I

416
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:15,579
can hit this with a stick. Let me try. Use the stick on here. Come on. Come on. You know you want

417
01:24:15,579 --> 01:24:28,390
to do it. Swing on... swing the stick. Ow. Damn it. I thought I could just whack it. I can't hit.

418
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:51,539
Damn it. All right. We need to go to bed. Try to hit a tree. Let me see if I have any more evolution

419
01:24:51,539 --> 01:25:02,859
points. I do want to do this. See if I can reach it. Is there enough points? Yes, there is. Thank

420
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:13,699
God. You can drop an item while moving as acquired. Good. Now that opened up something over here.

421
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:22,020
Need more dexterity. Motor skills. Growth potential for reflexes. More training is needed.

422
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:29,220
Motor skills. Potential ability to build. I have to like just bring trees and branches and

423
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:37,750
shit over there. All right. Lie down. Sleep. I'm getting up at 5 a.m. and we're going out.

424
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:49,739
Put down the children. The children give me bonus points.

425
01:25:50,460 --> 01:26:01,479
The ability to breathe while walking has been unlocked.

426
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:06,279
Oh yeah. Something like that. Somebody else is dead. How are there people dying?

427
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:13,859
Are those people that are still out in the wild? Okay. I've got my... we got two spears.

428
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:32,600
It's you. How did you die? Why are we just dropping like flies? I don't understand.

429
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:43,750
Analyzing the corpse of a friend generates energy as for other actions. Use it for evolution while

430
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:48,630
resting on it. Okay. I just got points for looking at it. Dead for zero years. How do I

431
01:26:48,630 --> 01:27:06,680
like get rid of them? This is gonna attract predators. All right. I'm doing something else.

432
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:24,619
Everybody over here. Eat. Come here. Everybody eat. Everybody drink. Use corpses of training.

433
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:37,449
Tell me that's not gonna work. You need to survive. We need to eat. We need meat to survive. We don't

434
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:42,979
need to eat meat to survive. The real question I have is why can I not break this stuff? We've

435
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:54,090
eaten all the stuff over here. We need more food. This settlement is done. We've eaten everything

436
01:27:54,090 --> 01:28:16,569
here. Follow my lead. I need building points. Hold on. Do what I do. Pick. Do what I do. Drop.

437
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:32,100
Right over here. You can do it. No, no, no. Hold on. And then I'm gonna burn this. Okay. Start

438
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:54,409
construction. Oh. I just figured it out. Various construction can improve your settlement.

439
01:28:55,210 --> 01:29:09,300
There you go. I just did it. All right. I deserve some water for that one. I got my weapon.

440
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:15,579
I am going to go. We need to find some more food or something.

441
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:33,300
What is that? Let's go take a look. Can I? I can't hit this. No. I can't break it.

442
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:40,180
Even with a stick. I don't. My butt. Ow. My like brain doesn't understand. I'm gonna climb up here.

443
01:29:44,779 --> 01:30:00,409
What have we got up here? Anything new? Yeah. Looks like it. All right. I'm gonna get this.

444
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:16,810
No snakes and shit, right? What is this? New stuff? What is that? What is this? Food. Found

445
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:47,720
the food tree. Eat up. No. I need to get. What the hell do I need? Nothing there. Are you eating?

446
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,770
Smell. Anything smell? That's something down there smells.

447
01:30:56,170 --> 01:31:03,460
I'm going that way. Can I inspect it? I think I've already inspected this I think.

448
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:08,949
Where's the other clan members? Especially where's the one with the spear?

449
01:31:09,989 --> 01:31:21,460
No. You're down there. Okay. Let's go. I'm gonna be careful this time.

450
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:30,199
I don't. I really don't want to fuck this up. I need to discover something.

451
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:46,390
Smell. Up top. Any apples? What's over there? I get something that way.

452
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:50,069
In there. There's something smells. I'm staying in the up up in the trees.

453
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:55,899
I ain't gonna get fucking killed up there. I learned new intimidation techniques.

454
01:31:56,699 --> 01:32:06,359
Got a pit stop right here. Easy. You got a stick? All right. We both got sticks.

455
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:18,020
You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm fine. That was just barely not enough to get hurt.

456
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:29,579
What is that? Oh, a new thing. No, that's I know what that is. A hiding spot. Okay. I know what

457
01:32:29,659 --> 01:32:44,220
that is. Another hiding spot. Don't know what that is. Let's check that out first. Memorize that.

458
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:53,399
Remember it. Burn it in your brain. Let's go. Okay, let's make our way down here. I'm gonna go up.

459
01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:08,729
Can I climb this? Climb the moss over here, right? You can do that. How can you not do that?

460
01:33:14,739 --> 01:33:34,649
Got it. This way. Have you seen this before? Is this new? I don't think this is new.

461
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:41,109
No, it's not. Just want to make sure this is not something new.

462
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:55,449
Nope, but it smells good. Eat it. Get over here. Get over here. Come on.

463
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:06,899
Well, I'm trying. I can't. Whatever. Let's go. Where was the thing that I wanted to inspect over

464
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:18,460
here? Oh, it was down here. Okay, right there. Granite rock. Granite rock. Don't need that.

465
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:28,869
What is that? Unknown. It looks like there's predator faces over there, though.

466
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:47,060
Is that a snake or something? More food. Are those mine? Are those my monkey friends?

467
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:52,060
Yeah, they are. Okay. I'm going over there. Is it a beehive?

468
01:34:52,779 --> 01:35:11,939
Somebody's choking. What's that? Do you hear that? Who's choking?

469
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:38,060
I don't know who's choking. That is a beehive. I'm gonna get the honey. I gotta go. I gotta go.

470
01:35:38,060 --> 01:36:00,069
Gotta go. Gotta go. Found it. It's right here. Why is somebody choking? I got it. What is it?

471
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:31,449
How do I take it? Okay, I gotta let go of this. Somebody is still choking. I don't know why. I

472
01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:37,829
died. Donut. Okay, I got my right hand is free. Here we go. Grab. Should I grab the beehive?

473
01:36:44,180 --> 01:37:10,760
It's bees? Kapok fiber. What do I do with this? All right. Who is that? What do I do with this?

474
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:36,220
All right, easy. Smash it. Apply. It's like soap. Okay, I learned how to bathe with like a

475
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:43,500
fucking beehive. What's next? Find a new spot that we haven't seen. There is a snake over there.

476
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:47,670
I am fucking around. This is what I wanted to look at. What's over here?

477
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:56,460
Okay, we know what those do. Let's get some drink while we have a minute.

478
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:02,409
Food. There's a snake over here. There's a snake over here somewhere. Wait, where's the snake?

479
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:13,850
I'm not gonna fucking die again. Where is it? Giant warthog. Where is there a giant warthog?

480
01:38:14,649 --> 01:38:25,020
We work together. Got it. Intimidated the warthog. We have sticks and shit. I would be scared too,

481
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:36,869
wouldn't you? I don't even know where they were. He saw the stick. All right, now let's go back

482
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:43,579
down here. Let's make sure there's nothing here. I don't see anything. What about here? I'm gonna

483
01:38:45,939 --> 01:39:06,520
know. Let's eat. All right, good. Let's eat. Let's drink some water on our voyage.

484
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:17,340
I need to put the stick down. I don't like that though. Maybe I should give the stick

485
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:40,300
to somebody else. Come on in and drink. He's drinking mud water. Give that person the stick.

486
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:50,390
I'm using my two children. No, I'm not. Then I'm not using like the kids' armor.

487
01:39:51,430 --> 01:40:04,739
I'm getting extra points for being here. What? What is it? What is it? What is it? Snake, snake,

488
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:21,819
snake, snake, snake. Intimidate. Together. Should I go to stab the snake? Nope. Intimidate. Let's go.

489
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:38,949
Together. That's right. Fuck off. All right, now throw javelin style into the snake. That's right.

490
01:40:38,949 --> 01:40:44,180
We got two sticks and our crew. You don't want to fuck with us. All right, what we got? We got some

491
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:47,539
new stuff over here. This is different. I don't think I know what this is. This is a new item.

492
01:40:48,420 --> 01:41:23,079
Let's check it out. Is it? What's going on? Why can I not inspect? Fishing spot. Huh? Oh shit.

493
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:32,649
Did I get one? I got one. Spear fishing. You found a way to get food in a fishing spot.

494
01:41:33,289 --> 01:41:46,140
Is it? What is it? It's a lobster. Nice. All right. Do we need to cook food? Did our ancestors

495
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:56,279
cook food? I think they just ate anything they found on the ground. What the hell? Oh god. What

496
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:17,909
do I do? Why is it? Are we just watching like a match? Where did that happen? He just kind of ran

497
01:42:17,909 --> 01:42:26,600
over. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to put down my like crawfish weapon. Somebody just puked.

498
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:39,560
Who just puked? How do I eat this? No, how do I eat the crawfish? How do I eat it?

499
01:42:48,149 --> 01:43:01,800
I want to eat the fish. Oh, whatever. Okay, let's go. I think that was over here.

500
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:05,479
Yeah, there's all kinds of fucked up shit going on over here. Relax, everybody. Hold on.

501
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:11,449
Don't get too crazy up here. Okay, there he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is.

502
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:14,409
What do we do? What do we do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

503
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:21,989
about this. Should we scream at him? Should we run? I think we've run. No, no, no, don't fight.

504
01:43:21,989 --> 01:43:38,069
Intimidate. Yeah, we got sticks. It's fine. Good. The sticks really do help. He's right there.

505
01:43:44,729 --> 01:43:59,859
Get out of here. Run away. I want to get over there. He's going to try to wrap around.

506
01:44:01,689 --> 01:44:21,960
Inspect the stick. I can't take it off. All right, watch out. Away from the pig.

507
01:44:22,039 --> 01:44:32,619
Can we sleep up in a tree? Up here, follow me. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where

508
01:44:32,619 --> 01:44:39,079
are you going? Come on. Don't be the one that's left behind. Where's the number three? Number

509
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:48,310
four. All right, we got four, right? I'm too stupid to grab with the other hand. What's wrong?

510
01:44:48,310 --> 01:45:13,720
Am I getting gas? Am I getting gas for andrological problems? That just gave me a stomach ache.

511
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:23,140
Should I not have eaten that? I need a place to sleep. We need to go over there. All right,

512
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:45,340
we need to go over there. All right, let's go. What is it? There's something over there.

513
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:56,220
Question mark. I got to get up top. We need to find a place to hang out before it gets too late.

514
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:11,659
I need to sleep. Holy shit. That would have been so fucking horrible. Okay, I'm almost at the

515
01:46:12,619 --> 01:46:18,140
unmemorized item has been forgotten. It's been forgotten. How does that make any sense?

516
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:25,779
All right. I found the thing that I'm... Why is there a ticking like,

517
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:49,100
bomb sound? No. All right, let's make camp over here. No, we don't. No, we don't. Don't make camp

518
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:54,789
over here. Don't make camp. Don't make camp over here. Don't make camp. All right, we can get up

519
01:46:54,789 --> 01:47:00,069
here. I don't know what it is. I don't know where I'm looking at. I hear something. This is

520
01:47:00,069 --> 01:47:13,180
alligators. Alligators. Jesus Christ. Get up. I don't know what to do. Hurry up and get up here.

521
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:35,210
He's trying to surprise. Let's help. What do we do? Should I stab? Go. He was trying to hold

522
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:40,229
his mouth closed. Where's the thing I need to get? It's over... Where is it? Over here?

523
01:47:41,029 --> 01:47:47,539
This is not the appropriate music for what's happening right now. This is like Dora the

524
01:47:47,619 --> 01:48:02,729
Explorer music. I lost my stick. Why did they want me to come over here? I need to get up high,

525
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:05,930
and then what's the thing I need to examine for my future generations to know what it is?

526
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:32,949
Where is it? Is it up there? I don't even fucking understand what the hell this wants me to do.

527
01:48:35,369 --> 01:48:44,520
All right. I'm dying. How do I stop bleeding? How do I fix my bone? How do I fix my bones?

528
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:50,199
I don't know how to fix them. I don't have no idea. I think you're alive still. Okay, you need

529
01:48:50,199 --> 01:48:56,039
to take... You're gonna take... You're gonna take everybody. Here, take... Take the kids. Take the

530
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:02,739
kids. Take the kids. Take the kids. How do I put the kids down? Take the kids. No, take the kids.

531
01:49:02,739 --> 01:49:26,489
Forget about this stuff. Take the kids. I need to eat something and just sit. Good luck. There's a

532
01:49:26,489 --> 01:49:46,600
hiding spot over there. There's a crocodile right below me. Oh, he's dead. I couldn't even hand off

533
01:49:46,600 --> 01:50:06,520
the kids. Here we go again. Okay, what are you gonna do now? He's just... He's following me up.

534
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:11,319
He's like, slow down. Wait, wait, wait. It's not worth it. You don't have to be great.

535
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:27,369
Just hold on a minute here. I think... I think we're still alive. We got to the top of the tree and

536
01:50:27,369 --> 01:50:45,270
then we somehow made it home. I don't know how. Okay, well, let's lie down. We've unlocked some

537
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:54,149
new things, apparently. A cognitive enhancement. Once connected, it would be possible to detect

538
01:50:54,149 --> 01:51:02,789
more distant elements through the intelligence. Okay. The ability to detect more distant elements

539
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:06,789
through intelligence is acquired. Tap Y to use your intelligence and follow the steps proposed

540
01:51:06,789 --> 01:51:16,039
by the contextual actions. Did I unlock anything over here? EU has an increased capacity to

541
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:25,000
metabolize food, but is EU even still alive? All right, let's lock in a couple more of these.

542
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:43,500
Lock that one in and let's lock this one in too. All right, the kids are gonna stay.

543
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:53,689
It feels like this game was made without any real premise. Just a bunch of ideas.

544
01:51:55,539 --> 01:52:10,390
Kind of. I'm good. Water, sleep, food. I don't have any sticks. Who's even left in the plan?

545
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:24,229
I've got a couple people here. All right, let me try. Give me rock and give me... What about two

546
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:34,489
rocks? Do two of these do anything? Two obsidian rocks. I mean, I just... I think there's something

547
01:52:34,489 --> 01:52:52,310
here. There's something here to explore. No. Pick it up. Give me the... Pick up the rock.

548
01:52:53,029 --> 01:53:04,300
Pick up the fucking rock. Give me the rock. Memorize where the rock is and look at it and

549
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:16,489
pick it up. No. Is there another one over here? I can do something with this too.

550
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:26,220
Pick up the rock. I could have just picked it up. Why can't I pick it up? Give me the rock.

551
01:53:27,029 --> 01:53:47,020
I just saw it. I just hit A. Fine. Take the other one. This person is so dead. Can I at

552
01:53:47,020 --> 01:54:10,060
least move this person out of the way? No, I can't pick up the rock because this game suffers from

553
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:31,739
so many games that do this. They tie every action to the same button. I'm just gonna make it fun.

554
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:55,899
Come here. I did it. Give me a stick. Give me this damn thing. I need another obsidian rock.

555
01:54:56,699 --> 01:55:09,260
I ain't gonna find one. I have to go looking for a rock. I mean, hold on. Can I do anything

556
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:21,880
with these two? I don't think I can. No. Make a gun. I don't think I have the necessary items.

557
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:29,880
Can I not look at this yet? I feel like I should be able to examine the briar patch.

558
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:39,210
Touch it and go, oh! Anyways, what's over here? What's happening over there? A snake of some sort,

559
01:55:39,210 --> 01:56:01,100
maybe? Is it a snake? What is going on here? Bugs? Can you eat bugs? Liftable rock. Okay.

560
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:24,739
I'm doing it with the stick. Come on. Use your strength. Oh, you idiot. I need a better stick,

561
01:56:24,739 --> 01:56:38,119
a bigger one, a stronger stick. What do we got over here? More stuff to look at. He's trying his best.

562
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:54,020
Well, get up there and look. Look at it. It was just like, oh, what's this thing over here?

563
01:56:54,739 --> 01:57:11,510
No, he doesn't care. No, you don't care. He still hasn't figured out that you can touch that.

564
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,680
Anything else over here that I can do? All this shit over there.

565
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:42,380
He's learning. I want to lift a rock up so bad. Come on. Liftable rock. I can do it. I just need

566
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:56,439
something stronger. Get everybody over here. Everybody, come here. We all might need sticks.

567
01:57:57,159 --> 01:58:08,149
Let me make a few sticks. I need like a stick tree. That one right there?

568
01:58:09,829 --> 01:58:32,819
No. Can we use this, though, for something? Are you guys coming? Here. I don't know. We're not

569
01:58:32,819 --> 01:58:41,260
going to be able to use this for anything, but I'm going to put it over here. Give me a stick,

570
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:49,289
a big one. I wasn't doing the rock thing right. I didn't have a prop to do anything. It was his

571
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:59,140
whole day. And let go when it makes that sound. I didn't hear a sound. All right, there's a stick.

572
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:10,659
That's for you. Come here. Here. You take that stick. We're all going to do this together.

573
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:34,550
Come here. You. You take this one. This one's mine. Follow me. We're going to go get the buried

574
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:39,829
treasure that's underneath that rock. With me. Let's go. Wait. First, drink on your own because

575
01:59:39,829 --> 02:00:04,310
you're stupid. Get over here. Drink. Just do what I do. Get in here. You're staring at it. You're

576
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:15,510
so thirsty, but you won't drink the water you're standing in. If only there was something cool and

577
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:42,420
refreshing. Why are you covered in blood? Get it. Why do they not understand this? How do you not

578
02:00:42,420 --> 02:01:07,210
understand? Let's go. Follow me. Follow. Let's go. Bring your sticks. You gave them sticks to hold.

579
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:14,810
Well, is that my fault that they're that stupid? Everybody together. Let's get this thing up. You

580
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:30,489
got your sticks? Good. Together. Over here. Here we go. Help me lift. Bingo. I found mushrooms.

581
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:54,340
There it is. Take a look at that. New food. African agaric fungus. Here, you eat this

582
02:01:54,979 --> 02:02:00,579
because you know who's the one that needs the most food? You. Just watch me eat it.

583
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:12,630
I think that means that I have a stomach problem. Here, come try it. We have to get our stomach

584
02:02:12,630 --> 02:02:31,770
stronger. Try the mushrooms. They're delightful. Anybody else gonna eat one of these? Okay,

585
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:49,140
so I know that those are mushrooms. Very cool. There is another spot right there. More mushrooms.

586
02:02:49,779 --> 02:03:08,039
Here, somebody take one of these. Take this. Here, try it. Look, see? Try it.

587
02:03:15,180 --> 02:04:01,779
Finally, he's eating it. Do you like it? It's good, huh? I think I think it's drugs. Okay,

588
02:04:01,779 --> 02:04:13,060
I think. Can we have some children? This is chio adult male coupled with clue.

589
02:04:13,779 --> 02:04:24,659
Well, let's keep going. I think there's another rock. Yep, there's more stuff over here to inspect.

590
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:41,960
What's this? What do we got? Grab. This is a new rock. Oh, this one's marble. Tool. The salt.

591
02:04:43,609 --> 02:05:01,189
What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? Is it just the drugs?

592
02:05:01,909 --> 02:05:23,800
It might just be drugs. What about the smells over here? I think we're good.

593
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:36,539
No, I don't see anything. All right, let me get this in memory. Why are too many drugs to figure

594
02:05:36,539 --> 02:05:47,289
this out? There's salt. Salt over here. I need to just record this. Evolution points for that.

595
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:57,210
All right, keep going. I thought I freaked out first. I thought that was a giant snake.

596
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:02,890
I thought that was the head of a gigantic fucking like pterodactyl snake monster alien

597
02:06:03,770 --> 02:06:15,500
with big spread out wings. I was about to shit my pants. What's over here? That anything up top?

598
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:20,390
I think I want to go to the one back there. This is too dangerous. I'm not high enough level for

599
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:29,579
this. Oh, there's that fiber. I probably should grab some of that. Yeah, let's get some of this

600
02:06:29,579 --> 02:06:35,430
fiber. I'm going to try to combine it with something right hangs on a tree down here.

601
02:06:37,510 --> 02:06:39,750
Can I do this? Can I? Maybe I can do something with these two things.

602
02:06:42,859 --> 02:07:15,029
Yep, let's make a spear. Am I hungry or thirsty? I can get the salt can alter a stick. Okay, got it.

603
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:29,979
Spin that around. I need to grab the it is a couple over here. Where is it? There's one hanging

604
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:33,899
from that tree right there. I need to throw this rock. I don't need it anymore. Just get rid of it.

605
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:48,140
And I'm going for right there. I want to use this because I don't want to just rub this on my body.

606
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:53,819
I want to put this somewhere else. You know what I mean? I need to craft this into something.

607
02:07:53,819 --> 02:08:12,140
Maybe I can grind it on the spear. Use it on the bloody clan member. That's actually not a bad idea.

608
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:17,819
That's not a bad idea at all. Where are they? Let me see if it's a problem.

609
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:34,649
Can I burn it? Maybe I can light it. All right, follow me back to the campsite.

610
02:08:35,449 --> 02:09:08,619
We are good. What's the dead? What's the dead thing? I know I knew that you were dead.

611
02:09:09,579 --> 02:09:15,909
Okay, there's the kid. Is there another person dead? I don't think so. All right,

612
02:09:15,909 --> 02:09:20,310
so let me see. What can I do with this? I have a stick. Let me get a rock. Give me a rock. I'm

613
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:33,210
going to hit the rock and fiber together. I want a rock. I would love to pick that obsidian up.

614
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:45,689
That's right here. But I can't. This is not possible. So we're going to go over here.

615
02:09:48,090 --> 02:10:05,500
Here's a rock. All right. Can I smash these two together? So I smashed them. That's not going to

616
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:21,720
do anything. Okay, I can stop it. Okay. What about this one? This other rock? This is obsidian,

617
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:45,210
right? Can I just eat this? Just crafted by itself? Okay. I can't. I'm missing something.

618
02:10:49,260 --> 02:11:00,069
Maybe the rock? No, something else. Smash it. Smash it. Smash with rock. Smash with rock.

619
02:11:00,069 --> 02:11:05,859
No, I need an obsidian rock. Not this one. This rock sucks. I need the obsidian rock.

620
02:11:06,819 --> 02:11:12,390
And there was two in my bed, but I can no longer get to them. So we're gonna have to find another

621
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:21,720
one. I already know what that is. Let's just identify all this shit. This gives me points,

622
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:33,220
right? Might as well do it. Sleep spot. Oh, another sleep spot. Dead branch. That's for sticks.

623
02:11:34,020 --> 02:12:08,140
Another sleep spot. Okay. Hello, baby. Fishing. Oh, there's a fishing spot right here. Obsidian

624
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:18,460
rock. I think I found an obsidian rock. Yes. Give me. Here we go. Will this do anything?

625
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:36,630
No, it won't. Well, I have an obsidian rock. I wanted this before. Try to sharpen this rock

626
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:42,310
with the other rock and then try to hit the sharpening rock on this thing. All right,

627
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:51,560
let's try that. Give me a rock. Put this down. God, fucking evolution sucks. Why did it take

628
02:12:51,560 --> 02:13:05,590
this long? Just learn to read already. Try to pick up this rock. Where's the rock that I just

629
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:24,020
threw on the ground? Now I have to go to bed. It's just a regular rock. Oh, full of love of God.

630
02:13:24,899 --> 02:13:36,470
Full of love of fucking God. Where is that rock that I had in my hand? And why can I pick it up?

631
02:13:50,489 --> 02:14:10,119
Jesus. Okay, let's go. Come on. I need another obsidian rock now. Fuck. Why? I did it.

632
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:24,409
I let it go when I heard the sound. What do you mean wrong hands? It doesn't make any sense.

633
02:14:25,130 --> 02:14:30,520
Do I really have to go on an expedition for a fucking obsidian rock? Because I can't get

634
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:36,539
this dumb thing out of here. Somebody's dead. I don't know. They wouldn't drink water while

635
02:14:36,539 --> 02:14:42,460
they were standing. I can't help you if you're going to do that. How am I supposed to help you?

636
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:52,199
You won't even drink water while you're standing in the water. I didn't heal him. What do you mean

637
02:14:52,279 --> 02:14:57,659
heal? And how do I tear this bed in half so I can pick up the fucking rock in here?

638
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:16,300
Oh my God. I have to go get a fucking rock. An obsidian rock to hit the... I need to sleep first

639
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:28,439
because there's no way I'm going to be able to do this without sleep. Go to bed. Okay.

640
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:46,939
Environmental analysis has been unlocked. I can detect rocks better. That's all I... That's it.

641
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:51,189
All right. Give me... Just keep this... Keep these ones around. These ones down here.

642
02:15:51,189 --> 02:16:00,729
That's fine. And let's do item manipulation while moving. That's fine, too.

643
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:37,739
Okay. Go to bed. Rock hunt. Oh, found a rock. Good. Except it's not an obsidian rock,

644
02:16:37,739 --> 02:17:02,680
so that's worthless to me. All right. Granite rock. Dead guy. Higher intelligence.

645
02:17:03,659 --> 02:17:09,819
Branch. I don't think there are any... I would... I really want to get in there and get that rock,

646
02:17:09,819 --> 02:17:22,680
but I fucking can't get in there and get that rock. I'm gonna eat and then go get a rock.

647
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:47,659
Yeah, I know I could have cured the bleeding, but I wanted to try... I wanted to try to combine

648
02:17:47,659 --> 02:17:53,819
the fiber with something else. I could have like wiped him off, but I would rather try to combine

649
02:17:53,819 --> 02:18:07,479
it. What's wrong with me? All right. I'm just going for it. No kids are with me. Give me a rock.

650
02:18:09,799 --> 02:18:19,559
Invention's more important than lives. I'm just gonna have to go down here.

651
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:48,229
Branch. Fishing spot. Ran... Fuck. Just give me a... What are you doing here?

652
02:18:48,870 --> 02:19:13,989
Why are you here? Get out of here. It's... Ew! How did you survive out here for so long? Holy shit.

653
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:32,520
I can't believe you're still alive. Is this... Is there a grip in this game? Okay. Good. Rest up

654
02:19:32,520 --> 02:20:16,940
here. Look who I found, guys. Any rocks? No. No. Can I make obsidian? That'd be great.

655
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:23,780
You... You and I have to find a rock. And that's the only rock that I'm gonna have for the whole

656
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:46,889
clan. And we can't find one. So I'm just gonna bring you back. That's so bad. That looks so awful.

657
02:20:46,889 --> 02:20:56,899
All right. Sit down. Hang out here for a little bit of you. I'm gonna sleep till tomorrow.

658
02:20:56,899 --> 02:21:32,309
Hippopotamus? Oh, wait. It's noon. Never mind. All right. Who is left? I don't understand. I don't

659
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:40,649
know. I don't get it. I don't... What? I need some water or something, please.

660
02:21:43,049 --> 02:22:01,399
I have to take the stick from you. Come here. Give me the stick. That's a rock. No, it's not.

661
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:19,030
That's that thing. Give me this. Stop paying attention to this and get over here. He's fucking

662
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:36,729
useless. No, now you go. Now you figure it out. I'm gonna take your stick, then. That's fine. All

663
02:22:36,729 --> 02:22:42,500
right. Give me some... Let me eat. I can't believe I'm still on this fucking quest for a dumb rock.

664
02:22:47,479 --> 02:23:17,620
There's an obsidian rock in my bed and I can't take it out. I can't, like, cover it up. I need

665
02:23:17,620 --> 02:24:05,510
to make more children. Hit obsidian with normal rock. Are you kidding me? It's not gonna... It doesn't

666
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:25,659
work. Combine rock with head. Throw the rock at the obsidian? That's not gonna do anything.

667
02:24:25,659 --> 02:24:33,219
Why is it so hard to find a one that's the most, like, prevalent rock on Earth? Just give me the

668
02:24:33,219 --> 02:24:51,610
obsidian. It's right here. Just give it to me. Let's just have sex. Come here. We're a couple,

669
02:24:51,610 --> 02:25:00,899
right? We gotta have some children. Come here. No, we're not. I thought we... I thought we were

670
02:25:00,899 --> 02:25:26,389
together. I thought this was... Apparently not. Is it female elder?

671
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:47,239
It's okay. We still... It's still possible. We're good. That's it. We're good.

672
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:23,610
Okay, do we have to wait, like, till next year? We're going to bed till tomorrow. Wait,

673
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:29,270
are we both... We're both female? Is that true?

674
02:26:44,180 --> 02:26:45,940
We gotta go extinct.

675
02:26:59,829 --> 02:27:01,750
The male was the one that was bleeding.

676
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:15,450
Oh, is it it? Is that over? Range detection for non-edible resources has increased.

677
02:27:15,450 --> 02:27:22,940
That's great. We're branching out, though. Hold on. Genetic mutation will be needed.

678
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:34,120
Okay, who's left? Spatial perception. Let's get this one down here as well.

679
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:41,049
There are wild males. I have to find them. Well, that's not gonna fucking work out.

680
02:27:41,930 --> 02:28:05,590
Where's my mate? That's not right. No. Is it? No, that can't be right. No, that's not it.

681
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:25,909
Right there. There we go. We're good. There we are. We have a job to do. We have to... I gotta go.

682
02:28:25,909 --> 02:28:31,500
All right, it's time to go. I'm not sitting around looking at a rock screen anymore. I

683
02:28:32,059 --> 02:28:45,909
gotta get... I'm going. Give me a stick. I need to find new things. There's a new thing.

684
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:57,049
I'm going that way. It's right here. Let's go. Find a male. What do you think I'm trying to do

685
02:28:57,049 --> 02:29:23,000
right now? I gotta try to find somebody. No, why are you here? You shouldn't be here. Both of you

686
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:41,670
shouldn't be here. Why are you both here? All right, I got them full on everything. It's time

687
02:29:41,670 --> 02:29:47,399
to move this way. I need to get something. Something. I have to get something going.

688
02:29:50,659 --> 02:29:58,889
There's that. We got something this way. There's nobody left at camp to watch them.

689
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:07,319
Right. That's... I guess that's true. We're gonna find it. We're gonna find a new camp,

690
02:30:07,959 --> 02:30:14,600
a new settlement. Hopefully, it's right here. No, don't forget that. Memorize that.

691
02:30:15,479 --> 02:30:39,139
All right, I gotta be careful. Don't do anything stupid. That was stupid. I'm fine. Okay, we're

692
02:30:39,139 --> 02:30:51,979
good. We're there. Almost there. Whatever this is, whatever that is, I guess I'm gonna go look at it.

693
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:59,829
How's everybody doing? Okay, you're with me still? You have any sticks or anything?

694
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:14,090
No, you don't. Okay, let's get on the tree. I'm gonna go down over here. Now, what does it want

695
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:21,180
me to do over there? There's some big point of interest over there. What? Why didn't it not grab?

696
02:31:21,979 --> 02:31:34,389
Okay, new stuff. It should have grabbed. Why did it not grab? What do you want me to do?

697
02:31:35,110 --> 02:32:06,389
What just happened? The Sister Arches. New landmark. New camp. Discover the Sister Arches

698
02:32:06,389 --> 02:32:21,530
as a memorable location. Good. So, what does that mean? Does that do anything for us? Not really?

699
02:32:22,329 --> 02:32:37,190
All right. Well, okay. What's next? Stuff over here to look at. More of that fiber.

700
02:32:39,190 --> 02:33:18,600
Hiding spot. It's a fucking obsidian. No, it's a granite rock. Wait. Hey. Hello. No, it's a pig.

701
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:39,930
What's that? Somebody else over here? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. How are you? Nice to meet you.

702
02:33:44,540 --> 02:34:08,120
You all right? Something's wrong. Do you have any gypsum? Just get the food. Here.

703
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:25,180
Take this. Eat this. How you doing? You good? Okay. And let's get another one. Let's get some more.

704
02:34:28,260 --> 02:35:03,260
Here. Try this. This will help. All right. Couple formed. All right. So, male. Okay.

705
02:35:18,739 --> 02:35:21,299
All right. Stay right there. Stay. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Everyone chill.

706
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:34,620
Where's the beehive? Okay. I'll be right back. I'm going to get one of these beehives

707
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:42,780
and I'm going to heal you. Stay there. Don't move. Where's one? Right here. There's one right

708
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:54,459
at the top of this tree. I will be right back. It's a long fall. I think I can make the jump

709
02:35:54,459 --> 02:36:32,940
from here to there. Give me it. Okay. I got it. Don't fall from that height. I want to climb down.

710
02:36:33,579 --> 02:36:49,110
Can I make it from here? Yes, I can. All right. Come here. I got something for you over here.

711
02:36:50,219 --> 02:36:57,719
Intimidate who? Who am I intimidating? Who am I intimidating? What the fuck is going on over

712
02:36:57,719 --> 02:37:20,440
here? Is it a bird? Over here. Oh, hi. Okay. You. You are... Here you go. I got something for you.

713
02:37:21,479 --> 02:38:05,670
Take that and rub it all over your body. You all right? What the fuck? I gave it to him.

714
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:12,709
I handed it to him. I think he's fine. He's not injured anymore. No, he's fine.

715
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:26,649
You have a broken bone. He... What? Did it take too long? All right. Let's go. New stuff.

716
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:40,409
Okay. We need to get back to... I can't go any further. This is literally the last of the entire

717
02:38:41,530 --> 02:39:01,139
clan. Right? We're going to head back. Let's make a bed over here. Can I just make a bed with these?

718
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:42,940
I think I can. Get out of the way. I'm trying to make us a bed. Is that enough? We got to get

719
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:55,659
this going. All right. Come here. No, no, no, no. I need to settle. What do you mean settle? Settle?

720
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:10,780
Oh, I made this my news. On the edge of a mount on a cliff. We did it. We bought a new home.

721
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:26,860
You and me. And the old lady. We did it. All right. Let's go.

722
02:40:43,579 --> 02:41:24,340
Hooray. Give birth. Let's go. New member. My child. 15 months later. Hey, Granny's still there.

723
02:41:25,139 --> 02:41:45,989
I was probably supposed to do this in the first like 30 minutes. Ran right into the screen.

724
02:41:46,629 --> 02:42:38,760
New baby. All right. Oh, there's another one. And she's so beautiful. Congrats on twins. I wonder if

725
02:42:38,760 --> 02:43:01,180
you'll learn anything. Go for another. Can you? I don't think you can. Maybe you can. Where's the

726
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:36,600
other baby? Okay. What's this? New communication skill. That's a long way to go. I don't think it's

727
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:45,850
gonna make it. It's not gonna make it. Oh, it made it. It's not possible to ask from a distance some

728
02:43:45,850 --> 02:43:51,659
clan members to come closer and follow. Hold B and release B to have the visible clan members

729
02:43:51,659 --> 02:43:59,750
follow you. Okay. Body language. I need to do some more like punching and kicking.

730
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:13,690
Evolution. Explore. Expand. Feared rival. Feared species. What is this shit? Advanced problem

731
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:19,159
solver? To launch an evolution, you must be at your clan settlement and have passed at

732
02:44:19,159 --> 02:44:29,209
least one generation and succeeded in evolutionary feat. Leading tool user rocks. Use the tool ready.

733
02:44:29,930 --> 02:44:42,979
Ready one. Ready three. Are these just achievements? Evolve. Birth of a cartographer.

734
02:44:42,979 --> 02:45:11,129
Okay. Now. I'm not mating again. No. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Item manipulation. Drop

735
02:45:11,129 --> 02:45:23,370
while moving. Body language. And this one. Okay. Change generation? Is that what I'm gonna do?

736
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:29,620
When passing a generation, the neurons that have not been reinforced will lose their energy and

737
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:36,100
will have to be refilled. All unborn babies will also be lost. Do you want to still pass

738
02:45:36,100 --> 02:46:17,479
a generation? Am I doing this? So we, we, these are the kids that are grown up now.

739
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:30,020
15 years later. Is that grandma? 15 years later? 15 years. 15 years. Reinforce your

740
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:36,149
lineage's neural development. Early phase one. What do you mean 15 years? Metabolism is now

741
02:46:36,149 --> 02:47:07,190
effective. Where is everybody? Oh, okay. This is you. Where is everybody? Who am I? Who are you?

742
02:47:08,229 --> 02:47:30,920
Oh, that's you. Okay. That's you. Okay. You and who am I? Okay. No, there's a lot of people here.

743
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:41,700
All right. So this is you. I'm going to play as you. All right. We're good. Anybody have any kids?

744
02:47:43,000 --> 02:48:03,290
You have any kids? Okay. So we have to, we have to do some, somebody has to have a kid. Oh,

745
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:08,389
shit. Look at that. You and the members of this, of the lineage will have the capacity to better

746
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:15,579
metabolize nutrients. This spontaneous genetic mutation will become effective after the lineage's

747
02:48:15,579 --> 02:48:31,190
next evolution. Okay. This is right. All right. I need to, we need to, we need to go out there.

748
02:48:32,149 --> 02:48:42,760
Okay. There's a lot of people. We got to fit this big amount of people here. So let's do,

749
02:48:43,719 --> 02:49:13,659
I want, wait, let's get some rocks. First things first. Let's eat. Okay. How's everybody doing on

750
02:49:13,659 --> 02:49:26,840
thirst? Have some sticks and some rocks and some spirits. Let's take a look at the new destination

751
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:34,200
we've got. Oh, somebody is over there. I think there's children. There's like 30 people in this

752
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:51,129
clan. Tribe or whatever this is. What is like a bunch of, what, what, what is it called? Is it a,

753
02:49:51,850 --> 02:50:08,889
is it a clan? A gaggle? I got a gaggle. Okay. What is that? I found the big stick in the middle of

754
02:50:08,889 --> 02:50:22,780
the forest. Let's go look at it. What did you want to do here? Is that not what you wanted me to do?

755
02:50:23,500 --> 02:51:02,569
Oh, it's not actually anything. Okay. Grass, fishing spot. Still, by the way, just want to

756
02:51:02,569 --> 02:51:08,899
make sure everyone's aware. I haven't seen a single obsidian rock on the rock. It's been 17 years.

757
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:30,680
I, this is just danger. I don't want to do this. This is bad crocodiles and shit everywhere.

758
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:43,430
This is a stupid idea. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you all going?

759
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:47,989
Where are you all going? Don't don't. Why are you running? Why are you running? Why are you all

760
02:51:47,989 --> 02:52:02,489
running the random directions? Excuse me. See you in rock though. We got to get some sticks.

761
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:21,959
Something right there that I don't know what it is. Oh, hold on. New tool. New tool. New

762
02:52:21,959 --> 02:52:31,590
gathering spot. It is a hole to poke. Dammit. All right. I need to give me this. Can I take a

763
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:46,139
branch off this or something? I got some more senses. I want to poke that hole. Is it a note?

764
02:52:49,350 --> 02:53:00,299
Run. Run. Oh my God. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up the tree, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,

765
02:53:00,299 --> 02:53:11,000
up the tree, up the tree. Everybody. Oh, my whole fucking body hurts. Up, up, up, up, everybody.

766
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:50,489
Okay. Random fucking tiger. Obsidian. Is it obsidian? It's probably the loudest sound I've

767
02:53:50,489 --> 02:54:03,860
ever done. You still around? No, there's alligators and shit. How are you ever supposed to do this?

768
02:54:07,559 --> 02:54:17,799
This is not even possible. How did anybody, how did humans survive? I can't even find a fucking rock

769
02:54:17,799 --> 02:54:35,719
on the ground. And you tell me that we've, no way. We were dropped off by aliens. Up the tree,

770
02:54:35,719 --> 02:55:01,190
everybody. I'm like bleeding. I need one of those fucking beehives. Here we go. Up here.

771
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:23,770
There might just be one up here. There it is. Give me it. Okay. Use it. Anybody else hurt?

772
02:55:24,409 --> 02:55:39,799
I got another one of these. Nobody bleeding. I just want a rock. I don't want to come this far

773
02:55:39,799 --> 02:55:52,680
out on an expedition. I just want a rock. I want an obsidian rock. Can't get it. I need a stick.

774
02:55:53,239 --> 02:56:14,090
I want to poke these rock. Let's go back to camp. I need to fly. Seriously. Have everybody

775
02:56:14,090 --> 02:56:22,579
else stay home while you get a rock so nobody dies. That's not a bad idea. That statement that

776
02:56:22,579 --> 02:56:32,149
is made is stupid. What the hell is going on now? Everybody stay home till I so I can find a rock.

777
02:56:32,149 --> 02:56:52,549
Okay. Let's go. What is over? It's a snake, I think. Snake maybe somewhere. Back to camp. Let's go.

778
02:56:57,860 --> 02:57:16,760
Down there. I need to, is anybody else bleeding? Just eat. Seven out of ten. Seven out of ten.

779
02:57:17,559 --> 02:57:27,590
What are you talking about? Can I combine these two? I wonder if I can combine.

780
02:57:29,299 --> 02:57:40,649
Maybe I can. Don't try this at home. All right. Here we are. Back at our camp. It's currently

781
02:57:40,649 --> 02:57:52,280
15 o'clock. I'm gonna combine these. No I'm not. Let me take a good look at all of you.

782
02:57:54,100 --> 02:58:10,200
Anybody bleeding? What does end expedition even mean? I'm gonna leave this here. Who would have

783
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:12,840
thought finding sticks would have been the hardest fucking thing in this whole game?

784
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:29,399
There was one tree that had sticks. I don't fucking want to do this thing, man.

785
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:36,940
Here. You take this. I don't know. Whatever. Can I use this? Maybe combine these two?

786
02:58:40,389 --> 02:58:51,219
No. Can I poke at the hole? All right. Everybody stay here. Wait. All of you. Nobody come with me.

787
02:58:51,219 --> 02:59:14,489
I don't want to see one person here. Stay. You too. All of you. Stay. Okay. I'm gonna go poke that

788
02:59:14,489 --> 02:59:24,100
hole. See what happens. It's down here, right? There was another one. I can't believe it's just

789
02:59:24,100 --> 02:59:43,459
granite. Where the hell am I gonna find them? Just mix lava and water. It's easier said than done.

790
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:50,020
Oh, finally. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad you came with me because we need to make some sticks.

791
02:59:50,659 --> 03:00:25,799
Take this. Now get the fuck out of here. Can I combine both the two sticks together for any

792
03:00:25,799 --> 03:00:31,639
reason? No. Just dual welding. Okay. That's fine. All right. Now, this is a stick I can poke with

793
03:00:31,639 --> 03:00:53,059
these. Fucking granite. Where was the hole? I really don't even know where the hole was. I

794
03:00:53,059 --> 03:01:18,600
thought they were right here. There it is. All right. Here we go. Poking. Food can be poked out

795
03:01:19,559 --> 03:01:29,719
of holes. Okay. So how do I learn stabbing if you know you can poke? Why can't you know you can

796
03:01:29,719 --> 03:01:44,250
stab? I haven't learned that yet, apparently. I hear something. There's something coming.

797
03:02:05,239 --> 03:02:14,040
Right there. Shake? Oh, it's dropping coconuts.

798
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:35,850
Coconuts have fallen. This is awesome. Okay. Hold on. I think it's a pig. Yeah, it's a pig.

799
03:02:50,920 --> 03:03:08,540
He's just chilled. I'm trying to spear this motherfucker.

800
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:22,440
I'm walking bait. Wait, can I stick it? Wait, hold on. I think I can do this.

801
03:03:24,950 --> 03:03:52,629
No, I want to stick a straw in there and drink it. I swear to fucking God, man. What?

802
03:03:53,590 --> 03:04:03,059
Oh, why does this have to fucking happen? God damn it. That's two in a row. Twice in a row.

803
03:04:05,659 --> 03:04:21,399
All right. Why can't the boar come over here? Shake coconuts off his head. Get away from me.

804
03:04:27,850 --> 03:04:30,409
No, get... No, no, no. Don't call anybody.

805
03:05:09,430 --> 03:05:37,100
Get away from... Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I need one of those things. No!

806
03:06:04,090 --> 03:06:40,620
Ew. Is that you? Ew. Come here. Ew. You all right? Oh, no, that's not... No, I'm all right.

807
03:06:40,620 --> 03:06:56,700
I'm you. Right. I know. Fucking rock. I want a fucking obsidian rock.

808
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:25,030
Why is that such a rare resource in this game? Okay. I can use granite? Well, why... Don't I need

809
03:07:25,030 --> 03:07:31,690
obsidian to scrape the granite to make it so it's a scrappy rock? I thought that was the whole deal.

810
03:07:31,770 --> 03:07:35,909
Otherwise, what the hell have I been doing for the last, like, 45 minutes?

811
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:53,180
I can just use two rocks. My caramba. What is... No, give me that. No, give that back to me.

812
03:07:54,299 --> 03:08:02,219
Yeah, you can't be trusted with this. This is mine. I need to sleep. Back to bed. Let's go.

813
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:33,909
I did end an expedition. I don't know what that does. All right. We got some new stuff to do.

814
03:08:33,909 --> 03:08:42,250
What's over here? How motor skills will improve. The neuron can't be initiated because you don't

815
03:08:42,250 --> 03:08:55,750
have the neurological energy. Carrying kids will perform... So I have to carry it on the kids.

816
03:08:56,389 --> 03:09:27,559
Do you want to sleep? I also need a water source. Yeah. Am I lying in with a skeleton?

817
03:09:29,020 --> 03:09:47,530
There's bones in here. I'm sleeping in a grave. All right. Now give me a rock. Give me two rocks.

818
03:09:48,409 --> 03:09:57,450
I need to drink water. And then... I don't even remember what the fuck I was going to do with

819
03:09:57,450 --> 03:10:07,399
those rocks. I have no clue. I was going to do something with the fiber, with the rock,

820
03:10:07,399 --> 03:10:25,670
that could be grinding. Right? I want to eat, not pick up an item on the ground.

821
03:10:34,420 --> 03:11:04,549
This is not very nutritious. How much do I have to drink of this shit? Is there anybody to even

822
03:11:04,549 --> 03:11:24,229
tell? There's just a big green circle on my screen. Just drink it all. All right. I'm going to make

823
03:11:24,229 --> 03:11:30,309
this a... Give me... Here we go. There we... Oh, you found two rocks. He found two fucking rocks.

824
03:11:30,309 --> 03:11:57,139
I'm unbelievable. All right. Now get out of here. Give me this. Give me a fiber. No, give me this

825
03:11:57,139 --> 03:12:12,629
thing. Can I like grind it with the sharpening thing? Let's see what happens. No, no, no, no,

826
03:12:12,629 --> 03:12:17,370
no, no, no, no. I need to... Give me one of those hives. There's always one there on top of the

827
03:12:17,370 --> 03:12:53,340
trees. Go. What's that? I heard something over here. What? Somebody just hit bro. Mother fucker.

828
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:57,739
Where are these things? I swear to God, every time I'm looking for something, it's not on the

829
03:12:57,739 --> 03:13:22,200
screen. There were just like 300 of these and now they just don't... They don't exist. What?

830
03:13:27,739 --> 03:13:39,430
Where are all the honeycombs? It's been hours and I'm still a monkey. Yeah. Sorry. I'm a little...

831
03:13:39,430 --> 03:14:01,260
I'm getting a little slow to the renaissance period. Sorry, guys. There they are. And I'm

832
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:08,040
hungry too. I'm very hungry. Like too hungry to even grab anything. Is there birds in this stuff

833
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:20,010
here? What is this? This is like a huge nest. New discovery eggs. New discovery egg. Who cares

834
03:14:20,010 --> 03:14:39,530
about this thing? I want... Give me the egg. Inspect it. Cook egg. Quick. Take one. Take it.

835
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:50,780
Take an egg. Quick. Take a couple of them. Drop it. Okay. I'm fine. All right. I got two eggs.

836
03:15:12,940 --> 03:15:31,049
Yeah. The spoils of war. Let's go get another one. I also have to get the rock.

837
03:15:31,770 --> 03:15:50,069
I left a rock up here. I need that thing. Where was it? Over here? Where was it? Where's my rock?

838
03:15:50,629 --> 03:16:08,469
All right. Let's do... Let's Spider-Man this. Let's get a good view. What the fuck are you doing?

839
03:16:10,819 --> 03:16:23,879
Remember, every action is the same button. Oh my god. What? Did you press A? Press A again. A.

840
03:16:23,879 --> 03:16:49,979
Hold A. Let go of A. Press A. Hold A. Let go of A. Press A twice. I'm bleeding. I need one of those

841
03:16:49,979 --> 03:16:56,360
things. I gotta find one. I know. I know I'm bleeding. I just need one of those things,

842
03:16:56,360 --> 03:17:03,620
but I got so disoriented. Let's... All right. Down there. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

843
03:17:17,940 --> 03:17:36,920
Give me another one. Give me my rock. I got my rock, motherfucker. See you later. Okay. So far,

844
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:53,430
so good. Now I just gotta get to... Over here. There it is. Go. Okay. Use it. I gotta stand on top.

845
03:17:54,870 --> 03:17:57,829
What's this? It's a golden egg up here. There's a golden egg. There's a golden egg here.

846
03:17:58,469 --> 03:18:03,610
I'm gonna pick up the golden egg. It's a golden egg. I'm gonna say the same thing five times.

847
03:18:03,610 --> 03:18:12,409
Ten times. What's this golden egg? No. I know what this is. You fucking idiot.

848
03:18:13,610 --> 03:18:17,049
I know what you're fucking rock. All right. Stop. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

849
03:18:17,850 --> 03:18:36,520
What is this? New food? Oh. These things are very nutritious.

850
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:59,959
They're similar to nutrients from this dope food. Okay. I got it. I have my rock. I just need...

851
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:34,579
I wish I had a... I wish I had a backpack. Can I make, like, soup? Never mind. Thank God.

852
03:19:40,059 --> 03:19:43,659
Okay. Seriously, I don't want to, like, let go of A, but I have to.

853
03:19:49,909 --> 03:19:55,209
I'm finally gonna do it. Here's the funny music, the good music, the you did it music. Here we go.

854
03:19:56,090 --> 03:20:03,659
It's time. I have in my hands right now, I have a grinding stone and fiber. I'm about to do something

855
03:20:03,659 --> 03:20:42,600
that will... it's taking four hours to do. You lied to me. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. Keep

856
03:20:42,600 --> 03:21:02,540
doing it. Keep going. Not long enough. I can't do it in the tree. I have to do it on the ground.

857
03:21:18,090 --> 03:21:22,459
Another jump scare tiger down here. Let me make sure. Hold on.

858
03:21:24,549 --> 03:21:33,979
Do it on the ground. Do I need to do it on top of sticks or something?

859
03:21:35,350 --> 03:21:38,629
I need an obsidian grinding stone. If that's the case, if that's true,

860
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:43,030
I'm going to be very angry because that's what I've been looking for.

861
03:21:43,590 --> 03:21:46,819
Everyone told me no. I don't need that. All right, let's try it. Here we go.

862
03:21:57,340 --> 03:22:07,479
Every button is the same button. Don't you understand? I fucking hate that so much.

863
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:28,729
Where is it? It doesn't matter. I can just... just give me... it's right here somewhere. It's

864
03:22:28,729 --> 03:22:35,459
right here, right? Just give me this one. Just fucking bang the rocks together again. They're

865
03:22:35,459 --> 03:22:44,120
right here. Give me the fucking rock. Give me two of them, please. Thank you. Give me another one.

866
03:22:47,770 --> 03:22:54,010
Sorry. Jump is also grab is also hold is also laugh is also grind is also fucking eat is also

867
03:22:54,889 --> 03:23:33,020
groom. It's also run. Where? All right. So should I fucking just do both of them? No.

868
03:23:33,819 --> 03:23:41,299
Don't throw it. Keep it in your hand. All right. Screw this. Here's what I'm doing.

869
03:23:41,940 --> 03:23:44,899
I'm fucking gonna turn this guy. I'm gonna turn this into a panini press.

870
03:23:45,780 --> 03:23:58,940
No, I want to do both rocks. Whatever. Can I only have which one is the which one's the griddle?

871
03:23:58,940 --> 03:24:06,500
Okay, good. Got it. Okay. Should I maybe try to grab at least they do try this thing. Maybe

872
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:51,819
I should try doing this. I'm going home. He's furious. I'm not furious. I'm fine. I'm fine.

873
03:24:51,819 --> 03:25:15,420
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine. But I will. I will put this down. I want to have. Yes,

874
03:25:15,420 --> 03:25:20,219
I got a grinder. I have a grinder in my hand. But what the hell do I do with a grinder grind up

875
03:25:20,219 --> 03:25:37,100
berries, seeds, berries? What? I don't understand. What do you? Why do I have this? That's so bad.

876
03:25:37,659 --> 03:25:47,899
There's only mushrooms. All right. So let's think about a scenario here where I don't get killed by

877
03:25:47,899 --> 03:26:12,260
the boar that's near me. Make a stick and kill the boar that there ain't even any combat in

878
03:26:12,260 --> 03:26:33,639
this game. I don't know what's going on. He's even killing other players. He's killing other

879
03:26:33,639 --> 03:26:39,159
players that aren't even me. What is there? Is there a cop? Why is this flashlight in my eyes?

880
03:26:45,739 --> 03:26:56,790
Help! Help! Where is he? I want to go to the boar and like pick up the boar meat.

881
03:26:57,510 --> 03:27:21,780
When am I going to discover fire? I don't think I'm going to discover fire. I'm having trouble

882
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:41,079
discovering rocks on the ground. You think I'm going to be able to do fire? What is it? Why?

883
03:27:41,079 --> 03:27:46,950
Why? What's here? What's here? Okay, just get rid of one of these fucking rocks. Which one of them

884
03:27:46,950 --> 03:27:51,750
is the grill? Which one of the rocks is like the griddle? Why is this? Am I being stalked? I can't

885
03:27:51,829 --> 03:27:57,829
tell which one is the grill on it. I don't know. Can anyone see? Okay, it's mounted in my left hand.

886
03:27:57,829 --> 03:28:11,930
That means right hand I can just throw it. I don't care. Okay, now what is this? What is this? Why is

887
03:28:11,930 --> 03:28:34,100
it telling me to like look at this or be aware of this? Inspect. No. Go to the light. Should I?

888
03:28:34,100 --> 03:28:54,659
What? Should I do that? Why is it doing some Truman Show shit? What did I just do? I just picked that

889
03:28:54,659 --> 03:29:17,430
up and waterfall. All right, there's the tiger and there's the boar. I'm gonna be patient here.

890
03:29:17,430 --> 03:29:28,200
I'll just sleep. Look at that. I want it. I want it. I'm gonna wait till he's gone. Should I throw

891
03:29:28,200 --> 03:29:31,959
the panini at him? Should I? I'm gonna throw my fucking panini at him and see if he leaves.

892
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:41,319
Don't don't do that. Wait, hold on. There's probably something I can throw over there,

893
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:50,709
right? Like a stick or a branch or something. I want that so bad. All right, here we go. All

894
03:29:50,709 --> 03:29:57,379
right. I've got it. I'm just gonna throw this over there because I want to build. I want to go like

895
03:29:57,379 --> 03:30:03,879
sniff. I want to go smell the corpse. That's what they do. Is that the panini? I can't tell.

896
03:30:04,760 --> 03:30:12,440
I don't even know what's in my hands. Okay, what's in my right hand? Okay, here we go. Ready? See if

897
03:30:12,440 --> 03:30:34,040
I can get him to move over here. Dude, I would love to do a jumping R1 on this fucking tiger right now.

898
03:30:42,739 --> 03:30:46,500
Why did it just put me like all the way down here? There's another combat scenario coming up here.

899
03:30:47,299 --> 03:31:03,590
There's a snake. Snake is going to the tiger right now. Look it. See? That's gonna be huge.

900
03:31:03,590 --> 03:31:07,270
This could be huge for me. I just have to observe and the snake might kill.

901
03:31:08,149 --> 03:31:13,739
Snake is right there. The snake might kill the tiger from behind.

902
03:31:19,049 --> 03:31:39,260
This is great. I love climbing. Apparently didn't learn that. Okay, sit right there. Is that not a

903
03:31:39,260 --> 03:31:50,760
snake? How do I get you to leave? Any rock plus stick equals weapon. I did. I tried that before.

904
03:31:51,639 --> 03:32:01,370
Can I sneak up and grab a stick? The only stick I can see is literally right here.

905
03:32:02,010 --> 03:32:07,399
There's a stick there. That's the only thing I can get it. I'm gonna try.

906
03:32:37,559 --> 03:32:58,500
This is scary. I made it. Okay, this is my chance. This is my opportunity to intimidate. I got my

907
03:32:58,500 --> 03:33:17,590
rock. What's wrong with me? Oh, I'm about to lose my mind. I'm about to lose my mind, right?

908
03:33:18,389 --> 03:33:22,709
Sniping with the rock. Okay, I gotta go for it right now. This is the time.

909
03:33:23,190 --> 03:33:32,899
Nope. Quick for other generations.

910
03:34:00,729 --> 03:34:32,659
Do we get to meet a tiger? We're fine. No more fucking around. I am pissed.

911
03:34:35,530 --> 03:34:52,729
Give me a rock. Give me a stick. I wonder if it's gonna take me like another 40 minutes to find a

912
03:34:52,729 --> 03:35:12,860
rock. Assemble a crew and avenge. Liftable rock. Got it. Oh, it actually means I can just

913
03:35:12,860 --> 03:35:46,379
pick it up. Okay, here we go. Ready? I'm making a deadly fucking weapon. A granite rock and

914
03:35:46,379 --> 03:35:59,159
altar stick. I already knew that. I now have my weapon in my hand. What's that thing? What's that?

915
03:36:01,129 --> 03:36:17,059
There's frogs. Hold on. Wait, wait, there's frogs. Can I pick them up? No. What was that? What is

916
03:36:17,059 --> 03:36:32,120
wrong with me? What the fuck was that? Does it mean I'm tired? All right, well, I got a stick.

917
03:36:35,770 --> 03:36:40,969
I need to hit something. The only combat that the game told me for a tutorial was

918
03:36:40,969 --> 03:36:47,819
A is dodge. I wonder if A is swing too. I mean, everything in this whole fucking game is A,

919
03:36:47,819 --> 03:36:59,739
so I would be shocked if it wasn't A to swing. All right, I'm going to bed. A is counter-attack.

920
03:36:59,739 --> 03:37:24,149
A is dodge. A is jump. A is learn. A. A for ape. Of course. I want to make another couple of sticks.

921
03:37:25,030 --> 03:37:28,139
When can I evolve to literally use my other hand for anything?

922
03:37:29,020 --> 03:37:39,059
I'm not just lefty. I don't have access to my left arm. I mean, I'm not just a righty. I don't

923
03:37:39,059 --> 03:38:14,440
have any access to my left hand. Where is my stick? Where's the stick that actually has a

924
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:42,389
sharp end to it? I'm killing this motherfucker right now. I just wanted to go to sleep. I just

925
03:38:42,389 --> 03:38:46,149
wanted to go to bed. I just wanted to get a rock and go to sleep. And now I'm gonna die.

926
03:38:47,030 --> 03:39:02,629
And I'm underwater now, so I can't even... There it is. Where's the bed?

927
03:39:05,079 --> 03:39:08,520
Where's the bed? The whole... This is... I'm looking... It's like cell-shaded graphics now.

928
03:39:09,159 --> 03:39:31,559
Is somebody pissed in my cell-shaded graphics space? Okay. Like, what... Where is the bed? Sleep

929
03:39:31,559 --> 03:39:56,010
it off. All you gotta do... Okay, food and water is bad. Very bad. Not good at all. I need to... Hold

930
03:39:56,010 --> 03:40:13,219
on. Do I have enough for this yet? No, I don't have any, like, children. Oh, no. My birth and

931
03:40:13,219 --> 03:40:24,819
death rate is terrible. I can't do any of these. Well, I know that there is water down here,

932
03:40:25,459 --> 03:40:40,379
but there's food as well. There is. Everybody come over here and eat. You've died every time

933
03:40:40,379 --> 03:40:53,579
somebody's been born. Well, come on. My only goals in this game are to eat food and dodge tigers.

934
03:41:12,149 --> 03:41:14,950
Failed both of them? Yeah, one of those is a lot easier than the other one.

935
03:41:15,590 --> 03:41:36,600
You're gonna over-hydrate and die. Hey, anybody else? Fucking idiot and doesn't want to drink?

936
03:41:36,600 --> 03:41:40,520
Come on down here. You need me to shut you out of the way. You can lead a man to water,

937
03:41:40,520 --> 03:41:48,700
but you can't make him fish or whatever it is. You can teach a man to fish, but you can't

938
03:41:48,700 --> 03:41:51,260
give him water. I don't know. Whatever that saying is. You know what it is.

939
03:42:05,510 --> 03:42:22,760
What's wrong with the one on the left? They all have, like, stomach aches. What is wrong with you?

940
03:42:23,479 --> 03:42:37,540
Are you hungry? He's holding food in his hand. Or is that a ring? Give me that,

941
03:42:39,139 --> 03:42:57,750
you idiot. He wouldn't eat it. He was holding his stomach on. Oh, man. I wish I had something to

942
03:42:57,750 --> 03:43:10,489
eat in my... I wish I had a ring pop like what's in my right hand. Okay, now it's time. The hot

943
03:43:10,489 --> 03:43:23,219
today is gone. All right, give me a fucking spear. Shake the tree. No, give me a... It's time for a

944
03:43:23,219 --> 03:44:08,659
smoke break. It might be. Smoke break. I'm gonna start drinking. Am I dead? Oh well. Better. Let me

945
03:44:08,659 --> 03:44:15,940
grind up a rock on this. Have a weapon. Go take a smoke break. I don't smoke. Don't worry.

946
03:44:16,899 --> 03:44:32,379
Add to pile? What does that do? Can I just have, like, a few of them here? I guess. Weird. Okay.

947
03:44:32,780 --> 03:44:44,729
All right. Let me just hang... I'm gonna have a sharpened spear. I gotta... You know what? I wish

948
03:44:44,729 --> 03:44:51,670
they would just pick it up. Why am I the only person that ever grabs anything? It's been 17

949
03:44:51,670 --> 03:45:04,100
years and nobody's picking up any sticks? Well, you didn't hand it to me. Okay. Here. Can you do

950
03:45:04,100 --> 03:45:14,840
something with this? I have to, like, equip all of my people with stuff. Why don't they learn?

951
03:45:15,239 --> 03:45:23,670
I'm the only one that learns here. Nobody else does. In fact, they're so fucking stupid.

952
03:45:23,670 --> 03:45:31,020
If they're holding an item, they will starve to death. Why? You didn't tell me to eat!

953
03:45:37,979 --> 03:46:04,620
Now it's time to just relax. Get over here. I'm gonna get my rock. I'm gonna make a couple

954
03:46:04,620 --> 03:46:12,360
of spears and I'm gonna go on an expedition. Here's food over here. I'm just gonna hang...

955
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:21,159
Here's food over here. I'm just gonna hang... No, don't end the expedition.

956
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:28,149
Where's there a fucking... This is... Okay, there's already one made here. This is the plan.

957
03:46:29,829 --> 03:46:43,049
Now I just need a rock and then the three of us are gonna go. Species is evolved. Yeah, we already

958
03:46:43,049 --> 03:46:47,940
did evolve. This is 17 years have gone by. There's already been another generation.

959
03:46:48,739 --> 03:47:19,610
You need to have babies. What is going on? Yeah, what? Evolution, guys. You don't... We grew, like,

960
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:25,350
extra hands and fingers from our grandparents. It takes, like, 10 years, right? All right,

961
03:47:25,350 --> 03:47:42,649
give me my sticks. I'm gonna mate. We're gonna have some babies. We're gonna go out with our

962
03:47:42,649 --> 03:48:14,649
three spears and I'm ready. God. I'll be right back. I... I'll be right back. I... Fuck it. I'll be back.

963
03:48:14,649 --> 03:51:33,510
I... I didn't even care what happened to me. Do I still have the rock in my hand?

964
03:51:55,110 --> 03:51:57,190
Don't cry. I'm gonna be fine.

965
03:52:04,620 --> 03:52:07,899
Get kids and carry them around. Do you guys remember, like, a couple hours ago when I was

966
03:52:07,899 --> 03:52:14,120
doing that and everybody told me not to do that anymore because I was endangering the children?

967
03:52:14,120 --> 03:52:19,430
Turns out it was what I was supposed to be doing the whole time. All right, I've got... Give me the

968
03:52:19,430 --> 03:52:33,159
third stick. Your ancestors were fucking stupid. Hey, well, guess what? They were your fucking

969
03:52:33,159 --> 03:52:40,819
ancestors, too. You think that's gonna offend me? This is your great-great-great-great-great

970
03:52:40,819 --> 03:53:19,590
grandparents, too. So, I have weapons. Three spears are made. Maybe I should do a fourth just

971
03:53:19,590 --> 03:53:27,739
to make sure we're all ready. Do I... Is that it? One more? Sometimes it's hard to tell. Okay,

972
03:53:27,739 --> 03:53:39,479
another one. One... One more? Okay. Three spears. There are one... Here comes the deep freeze. Here

973
03:53:39,479 --> 03:53:53,190
comes the ice age. All right. One, two, three. There are four of us. Four spears. We're gonna have,

974
03:53:53,190 --> 03:54:28,629
like, three kids make a fire. I have no idea how to do that. Every time I've tried to, it doesn't...

975
03:54:29,270 --> 03:54:41,059
I bang two rocks together, scrape two rocks, grab a leaf, scrape a leaf, rub two sticks together

976
03:54:41,059 --> 03:54:46,870
on top of leaves. I don't think I can do fire. Didn't somebody say I couldn't do that yet?

977
03:54:47,670 --> 03:54:53,959
Okay, I got four spears. Let's put them down. I'm gonna... This is my community rock.

978
03:54:53,959 --> 03:55:05,430
Just let it sit there. Who wants to come lie down with me? What have we got? I... Am I female?

979
03:55:06,229 --> 03:55:21,700
I'm not sure. All right, come here. You. I think you and I should be hanging out,

980
03:55:21,700 --> 03:56:27,559
maybe. All right, come to bed. We need two kids, and they have evolved. Four spears for the four of

981
03:56:27,559 --> 03:56:40,100
us. We're gonna go out. We're gonna douche. We're gonna... We're gonna make it happen. I have to

982
03:56:40,100 --> 03:56:54,739
watch this every time. It wouldn't be bad if it was not the same cutscene. Like, do like three

983
03:56:54,739 --> 03:57:04,680
different potential cutscenes. Here we go. Doing it again. Baby with the spontaneity's genetic

984
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:26,860
mutation. Here comes another one. We're gonna wear both the babies. Gonna go out, dig up some

985
03:57:26,860 --> 03:57:35,770
mushrooms. Hopefully, down a taiga while we're at it. You know what I mean? Down a taiga. Get a...

986
03:57:36,569 --> 03:58:10,149
Eat, drink, be equipped. I wonder if he's gonna run into the camera. Cool. All right, two babies.

987
03:58:10,149 --> 03:58:17,299
Let's go. Have we slept? Have we... We've slept, I think, right? All right, let's go, kids.

988
03:58:22,379 --> 03:58:34,069
Everybody gather up. What are they doing? You slept for two years. Okay, everybody,

989
03:58:35,370 --> 03:58:54,440
listen up. What I want you to do is I want you to grab a stick. Mannequins. All of you. Here,

990
03:58:54,440 --> 03:59:07,799
this one's for you. All right, we are now armed. I want to pick up the kids. How do I pick up these

991
03:59:07,799 --> 03:59:25,350
kids? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's head to the stream. I would like everybody to eat something

992
03:59:25,350 --> 03:59:39,750
before we move out. Follow my lead. Pick up a berry. Eat it. Watch me. You know what? No,

993
03:59:39,750 --> 03:59:45,030
let's go fishing. Let's go fishing and just eat raw fish and shit. Whatever. With me, let's go.

994
03:59:45,750 --> 04:00:04,780
Where's that fishing spot? I know there's one over here. All right, learn through me. Do as I do.

995
04:00:05,500 --> 04:00:11,530
I mean, somebody's gonna make a reference here about something seeing and something doing,

996
04:00:12,250 --> 04:00:39,610
but I'm not gonna make that. Just follow me and do what I do. And got one. Oh, this is a fish.

997
04:00:39,610 --> 04:00:53,450
This is a bass. This will feed us for days. Okay, who's gonna eat this? Should you eat this?

998
04:00:55,350 --> 04:01:03,190
All right, I'm gonna show you how to eat this. See? I took a bite out of it. It's good, huh? Hey,

999
04:01:03,190 --> 04:01:24,379
kid, try this. Don't try this, actually. You probably shouldn't try this. Okay, now you try.

1000
04:01:25,180 --> 04:01:33,909
See? It's pretty good. Try it. Don't eat it all. Don't eat the whole thing. Greedy.

1001
04:01:34,790 --> 04:01:45,219
Very greedy. You shouldn't be doing that. See? You pissed up Dave behind you. Take your stick back.

1002
04:01:45,219 --> 04:01:53,860
Let's do it again. Look at me. Follow me. These kids are gonna learn this too. This is an invaluable

1003
04:01:53,860 --> 04:02:12,739
skill. Here we go. Ready? Is it gone? Fucking Chad walk. Oh, hey, we should have given you that

1004
04:02:12,739 --> 04:02:19,430
fish. All right, stay there. That's what I was talking about. This is why you don't eat the whole

1005
04:02:19,430 --> 04:02:45,290
thing. What happened? Where did my stick go? Oh, give me a fucking break. Isn't this a fishing spot?

1006
04:02:45,850 --> 04:02:54,229
No, you can have this back.

1007
04:02:58,540 --> 04:03:09,959
So, why can't I not? Somebody, we gotta help this guy. This haha, I keep losing stuff. It's

1008
04:03:09,959 --> 04:03:24,180
not funny anymore. Here, take a crab. Haha, I keep losing stuff. Here. Actually, no, no, no.

1009
04:03:29,430 --> 04:03:43,930
Take this. Eat. Delicious, huh? How do you feel? You feel better? Good. Pop. All right, let's go.

1010
04:03:44,649 --> 04:03:51,000
Everybody. Pa, you don't have a weapon, but that's all right. Look at. Are you gonna fish?

1011
04:03:51,719 --> 04:04:04,120
You're gonna fish? She's gonna do it. All right, let's keep moving. We are going to examine

1012
04:04:05,239 --> 04:04:11,500
that. Get it into your memory and then forget it.

1013
04:04:30,069 --> 04:04:48,219
No crocodiles. Let's go. This game is really cool. Haters be gone. I think this game is really cool.

1014
04:04:48,700 --> 04:04:56,520
I think this is a really, really awesome game underneath a layer of unintuitive control.

1015
04:04:57,559 --> 04:05:14,440
Like this is, this is, we talk about fossils. This is a fossil that's underneath

1016
04:05:14,440 --> 04:05:24,040
a layer of fucking sand. There's gold under there, but you've got to dig down like 25 feet to get it.

1017
04:05:24,680 --> 04:05:45,510
And right here, there it is. I found the giant waterfall. I'm gonna get a cut scene, right?

1018
04:05:45,510 --> 04:05:51,770
But this is like, oh, this is an Irish spring. It must be an Irish spring.

1019
04:05:52,250 --> 04:06:21,350
I just turn the fucking stream off and I never stream again. I make one tweet a year that says

1020
04:06:21,350 --> 04:06:34,489
it's an Irish spring. You never see me again. Something going on here. Something going on here.

1021
04:06:35,049 --> 04:06:48,459
All right. Did he pick somebody up? What happened? We good? Why are you all hiding?

1022
04:06:52,360 --> 04:07:03,559
We're supposed to work together as a team. God damn it. Fucking useless. Useless. Useless.

1023
04:07:03,559 --> 04:07:17,700
Useless. What? Something in the water. Don't go in the water. Stay out of the water. Everyone

1024
04:07:17,700 --> 04:07:58,700
out of the water. Don't go in the water. What is in the water? Hiding spot. All right. We got to

1025
04:07:58,700 --> 04:08:02,780
make it. This is the new shelter. We're making camp here and then we're going to evolve. I'm

1026
04:08:02,780 --> 04:08:16,069
pressing the button. No, don't make noise. Where is it? What is it? What is it? What's the noise

1027
04:08:16,069 --> 04:08:26,200
here? What are we supposed to be looking for? I don't know what's wrong. I'm starting to get

1028
04:08:26,200 --> 04:08:34,809
a little scared here. How do I fix a broken leg? I gotta sleep. All right. Fuck it. Make camp.

1029
04:08:36,229 --> 04:08:42,420
I need some sticks. I need some twigs. I need some yarn. Where's our newest recruit? He needs to

1030
04:08:42,420 --> 04:08:52,010
get away. Take my stick. Take this. No. Take it. Take this. What are you holding? You have a stick.

1031
04:08:52,010 --> 04:09:02,100
Who doesn't have a stick? You. Come here. You're gonna fucking hurt too. All right. It's time to

1032
04:09:02,100 --> 04:09:21,940
set up shop. Okay. Where is this thing? It's spawned. Get in the water. Everybody get in the

1033
04:09:21,940 --> 04:09:40,379
water. We all lions hate water. Use your sticks. Do something. Somebody do something. He's spawned

1034
04:09:40,379 --> 04:09:53,930
in. Somebody scare him. He won't come in the water. What was that? Why do we all get sucked down?

1035
04:09:57,559 --> 04:10:06,790
Okay. We got like pulled in like the undertow. What is in here? It is the undertow, isn't it?

1036
04:10:07,510 --> 04:10:17,500
What is this? I don't understand what the problem is. All right. Get me the fuck over here. I need

1037
04:10:17,500 --> 04:10:30,969
food. He's still here somewhere. Is there a cave behind the waterfall? Follow me. Pick up the orb.

1038
04:10:32,180 --> 04:10:42,139
Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Pick it up. What the fuck are you doing?

1039
04:10:43,110 --> 04:10:51,690
Pick up the orb. Why can't I get the orb? You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1040
04:10:56,700 --> 04:11:06,149
Please. It's in the background. So was I being lied to about the orb?

1041
04:11:08,329 --> 04:11:20,620
Why is it in my face? It's like eclipsing me. Okay. You explain to me what happened here.

1042
04:11:36,280 --> 04:11:41,819
Eat this. Eat this. Eat it. What is this? Eat it. I can't eat it. Where are my friends?

1043
04:11:42,780 --> 04:11:46,379
Where's food? I need food right now. Like I need to eat something right now.

1044
04:11:49,819 --> 04:12:10,739
Fucking tiger spawned in next to the lake. I can't eat this. All right. What is that? Food.

1045
04:12:10,739 --> 04:12:15,829
I'm fucking believing. Okay. I need to change. I need to switch to you or something.

1046
04:12:16,629 --> 04:12:26,920
My bone is healed, but I'm still I need to go. I need the that thing up there. I can't believe

1047
04:12:27,639 --> 04:12:37,940
that I got like a server admin spawned a fucking tiger in on the lake. I need to like find

1048
04:12:38,579 --> 04:12:47,399
one of those things, but I can't carry anything. So you get a tiger spawned up your ass and then

1049
04:12:47,399 --> 04:12:52,760
the tiger kills everybody. And then you have to run around like an asshole trying to find like

1050
04:12:52,760 --> 04:13:12,540
the fruit hanging from the tree to peel your broken bones and shit. I'm going out. I'm going out. I'm

1051
04:13:12,540 --> 04:13:22,469
going out. I'm going out. I'm going out. Okay. I'm alive. What are you doing? Give it to me.

1052
04:13:23,190 --> 04:13:45,290
We even brought stuff with us. This game. Seriously. Is anybody else hurt? We need to go to

1053
04:13:45,290 --> 04:14:06,139
bed now. I would love to put a shut up shop next to the waterfall. Come here. Who else is injured?

1054
04:14:06,700 --> 04:14:16,020
I can't really tell from here. Can everybody get up here? Is it just the two of us? I'm just

1055
04:14:16,020 --> 04:14:20,500
going to bring two of them with me because there's one more here, right? Where did I get them both?

1056
04:14:21,459 --> 04:14:45,079
I literally as if there's a tiger here, I'm going to uninstall the game. Go get the orb. I'm not

1057
04:14:45,079 --> 04:14:51,639
going to get the fucking orb. There is a tiger here like hiding in that bush. Is it in the rock?

1058
04:14:52,440 --> 04:15:12,940
That's how you regain your sanity. Well, I chased one around for 30 seconds and it just

1059
04:15:12,940 --> 04:15:19,940
glitched into my screen. If you don't get the orb, you go insane. Well, why did it not work last time?

1060
04:15:27,219 --> 04:15:42,649
Reach conquer zone. Didn't I already do this though? What the fuck are you? What the fuck are you

1061
04:15:42,649 --> 04:16:15,780
talking about? Like it's like inside. Where is this? Every fucking time. Every time. Every single

1062
04:16:15,780 --> 04:16:25,100
fucking time. Come on. Who's hurt? And then I'm going to, we're going to have to put a,

1063
04:16:25,100 --> 04:16:36,260
we're going to make a little camp back here. So if you go outside of the waterfall, all of a sudden,

1064
04:16:36,260 --> 04:16:40,020
you've lost your mind again. No, don't go out of there. It's, it's not safe out there.

1065
04:17:02,250 --> 04:17:13,110
What the fuck is this talking about? I don't understand this. I have to conquer my fear

1066
04:17:14,149 --> 04:17:44,120
of, of over there now. The water is scary. How far away is this? I don't. Okay. Is this it?

1067
04:17:44,760 --> 04:18:02,819
I got it. Conquer your fear. Conquer your fear. Please eat something. Who's hurt?

1068
04:18:03,700 --> 04:18:07,879
Anybody with blood on them? How are you doing? You all right? I think you got blood on you.

1069
04:18:08,600 --> 04:18:13,930
Come here. We need to eat. This is the worst game I've ever played in my whole life.

1070
04:18:14,969 --> 04:18:20,489
This is the worst game ever. This game, this, this is probably, this is like up there,

1071
04:18:20,489 --> 04:18:36,870
like top five worst games I've ever played. He wasn't even here. He's not even here.

1072
04:18:39,719 --> 04:19:15,860
He just spawned. This is like the fucking slender man. How do I attack? I swear to God.

1073
04:19:20,139 --> 04:19:25,659
It's not fair. I was just, he's, somebody has fucking cheats.

1074
04:19:28,659 --> 04:19:37,139
I've conquered my fear of water. Let's drink some.

1075
04:20:07,239 --> 04:20:13,879
Is he drinking too fast? Okay. Where are the babies? Thank God. The babies are safe

1076
04:20:15,819 --> 04:20:25,780
or at least one of them is. Okay. Let me, I need to, I need to sleep. I need to, I need to. Hey,

1077
04:20:25,780 --> 04:20:37,559
look, now guess what I have to fucking do. I think the tiger's here again. Did you hear that shit?

1078
04:20:47,159 --> 04:20:52,840
I have, I have to go get one of those sky fruits because I'm bleeding now.

1079
04:20:54,860 --> 04:21:00,870
And when I go to get a sky fruit, I'm going to get attacked again. And then it's going to eat

1080
04:21:00,870 --> 04:21:13,750
three people. And then I'm going to have to get another sky fruit and then just leave the area.

1081
04:21:13,750 --> 04:21:21,100
That's what I tried to do. And then tiger spawn. I was very clearly, I looked at every direction

1082
04:21:21,100 --> 04:21:24,700
and the tiger wasn't there. And then all of a sudden, I, sorry, I picked up the fourth notebook

1083
04:21:24,700 --> 04:21:35,350
page. So he comes faster and there's no, none of those things around. I might as well just die.

1084
04:21:36,299 --> 04:21:39,100
Just somebody, all right, I'm going to turn around and just hit me in the back of the fucking head

1085
04:21:39,100 --> 04:21:52,229
as hard as you can with that thing. And then eat me. Some, just eat me. All of you. Sometimes

1086
04:21:52,229 --> 04:22:25,590
you have to make sacrifices. Give this to me. Let's make a camp. Who cares where it is? No,

1087
04:22:25,590 --> 04:22:47,959
get out of the fucking way. Oh, Jeff, those gators. All right, can I stomp on this yet? Hey,

1088
04:22:47,959 --> 04:22:53,670
oh, I wonder what it is. Is it a tiger? Hey, was I just looking in that direction and there was no

1089
04:22:53,670 --> 04:23:02,440
fucking tiger. Does anybody have a spear? Give me that thing. Give me that spear.

1090
04:23:03,159 --> 04:23:11,159
Give me that fucking thing right now. Come here. Give me the spear. No, stop running. Give me the

1091
04:23:11,159 --> 04:23:18,090
spear. You give me that spear. I need that. Give it to me quickly. Oh, he's dead. So I'm going to

1092
04:23:18,090 --> 04:23:26,860
get the spear anyways. Spear. Okay, here we go. How do you counter attack? What happened to my

1093
04:23:26,860 --> 04:23:46,579
hands anymore? Where the fuck is it? It's on my hands. I just picked it up. Was he smashing?

1094
04:23:52,250 --> 04:24:02,809
He was just hitting something on the ground. I don't know what he was hitting. He was smashing

1095
04:24:02,809 --> 04:24:15,909
somethings at it. Was he killing another monkey? I don't know. Oh, hey guys. I was

1096
04:24:15,909 --> 04:24:27,909
fancy seeing you all here. He made it back. Hold A. Okay, I held A but the problem was I

1097
04:24:27,909 --> 04:24:48,520
dropped the spear. Hold A. That's what I did. No, you pressed A. They've made it X or like

1098
04:24:49,319 --> 04:24:58,870
right trigger or any other button besides A. They couldn't have done it like B.

1099
04:24:58,870 --> 04:25:56,229
Everybody's bleeding. So let's go across the map to find another one of those healing scrubs

1100
04:26:06,329 --> 04:26:44,440
and the cycle repeats itself. Do I have any spears or anything? Reaction time for attacks

1101
04:26:44,440 --> 04:27:05,399
will be increased. Oh, sure. Hold A to prime dodging or attack. Move left stick to choose

1102
04:27:05,399 --> 04:27:34,260
direction. Release A at the right time to dodge or attack. Okay, so dodge towards them to attack

1103
04:27:34,260 --> 04:27:45,290
but that's been dodging. I've been dodging like towards these motherfuckers. I just got

1104
04:27:45,290 --> 04:27:52,649
$50 from Phylacter Lich. Thank you. I'm glad you have a Wendy's nearby or you'd be fucking dead.

1105
04:28:04,260 --> 04:28:09,299
No, give me a break though. Could be like hold A and then tap forward and let go of A.

1106
04:28:09,940 --> 04:28:13,780
Why can't I just have like an animation where I fucking bash the motherfucker with like X?

1107
04:28:14,579 --> 04:28:41,239
What is this like QTE thing? Thank you for the $50. Is there a sound cue? I don't know.

1108
04:28:43,350 --> 04:28:53,379
But I can take care of my own food. Trust me on that. I know how to cook two things. I know how

1109
04:28:53,379 --> 04:28:59,430
to make a hamburger all the way to well done because I'm too scared to take it off any other

1110
04:28:59,430 --> 04:29:04,389
point because I think I'll get sick and I know how to make a delicious salmon in the oven.

1111
04:29:05,030 --> 04:29:08,629
You just put a piece of salmon in the oven with some with some fucking spices and seasoning and

1112
04:29:08,629 --> 04:29:12,229
some some you put the water sauce and shit all over it and you put it in the oven for like 10-12

1113
04:29:12,229 --> 04:29:19,030
minutes you know you can't fuck it up you just take it out and eat it. I also know how to make

1114
04:29:19,030 --> 04:29:26,520
spaghetti al dente. It's four minutes although I do have to be careful because one time I did make

1115
04:29:26,520 --> 04:29:32,600
my famous crunchy al dente spaghetti for a family get-together and four people chipped their teeth.

1116
04:29:33,479 --> 04:29:38,280
And I'm still dealing with that family lawsuit to this day so I gotta be careful. I gotta be

1117
04:29:38,280 --> 04:29:51,059
more aware. Anyways thanks for the 50 bucks and thank you Great Canadian FK Club for the 10 subs.

1118
04:29:51,059 --> 04:30:02,549
Appreciate it. Hold A to prime to dodge or attack. Move left stick to choose a direction. Let go at

1119
04:30:02,549 --> 04:30:10,200
A at the right time to dodge or counter attack. I am just gonna go kill something. I'm ready.

1120
04:30:10,920 --> 04:30:19,129
Next step and more just yeah. This is what happened. This is what happened to me.

1121
04:30:19,850 --> 04:30:24,889
Everybody thought I was lying. Everybody thought I was a liar. I dodged and I dropped my fucking axe.

1122
04:30:24,889 --> 04:30:28,809
Once connected the chance of dropping an item when a dodge happens it will decrease. I dodged and it

1123
04:30:28,809 --> 04:30:41,370
dropped the fucking axe on the ground. Like what was I supposed to do? I don't have enough power

1124
04:30:41,370 --> 04:30:55,639
yet. All right I want that. I want that to follow in future generations. There's an audio cue for

1125
04:30:55,719 --> 04:30:59,159
counter-attacking. You have to do it towards the enemy. What's with the fucking audio cues?

1126
04:31:06,569 --> 04:31:17,690
Phylactery Lich gave another 50 dollars. What am I doing? Everybody go home. I have four holes in

1127
04:31:17,690 --> 04:31:56,020
my body. They didn't make it. They didn't make it. I sent them all home. They fucking died in front

1128
04:31:56,020 --> 04:32:23,959
of me. I think they're standing on top of me. All right it's just you and me and you. I need a

1129
04:32:23,959 --> 04:32:32,389
spear or something. Give me that. I need to heal. Is this thing sharpened? It is not. Thank God

1130
04:32:32,389 --> 04:32:38,389
there's somebody still alive. All right give me the rock. Here we go. I'm not I am not fucking

1131
04:32:38,389 --> 04:32:48,260
around now. I'm gonna do this restart. What do you mean restart?

1132
04:33:02,620 --> 04:33:10,540
We're going and we're killing us. A lion and the expedition. I just did. I just didn't. They all

1133
04:33:10,540 --> 04:33:26,889
died. I already did the expedition. Yeah there are too many bodies lying around in bones.

1134
04:33:27,849 --> 04:33:44,200
Okay now I have to go get one of those things. Let's go. Hurry up. Eat the other bodies. I can't

1135
04:33:44,200 --> 04:34:03,419
do that. Why do these things have to be so far away from where I am? Evolve. Evolve. All right

1136
04:34:03,419 --> 04:34:23,750
I'm evolving. Fuck it. I got two kids here. Evolve. I'm done. Keep that acute response and I think

1137
04:34:23,750 --> 04:34:30,340
that's all I can do right now. Evolve. Change generation. Let's go. I got nothing else I can

1138
04:34:30,340 --> 04:34:55,290
put it in. Let's go. Yeah go. I got two kids but file actor thank you for the hundred bucks.

1139
04:34:56,090 --> 04:35:03,779
Thank you for real. That's a shitload of money and a great Canadian FK club. Thanks both of you.

1140
04:35:03,779 --> 04:35:33,619
Another 15 years. Okay we're in year 35. How are we doing? Okay we're good. We need to have some

1141
04:35:33,619 --> 04:35:44,939
more kids. Everybody with bones? No. Okay give me my I need a spear. I'm gonna go try to kill

1142
04:35:44,939 --> 04:36:02,520
something. This is gonna take a while. I hope I'm not the only one alive. No there are at least a

1143
04:36:02,520 --> 04:36:17,189
couple other here. All right here we go. I'm going to get one of these. There's one. Just I'm gonna

1144
04:36:17,189 --> 04:36:28,549
just have them at the base. I'm gonna go pick them up. Just go get them. Nobody follow me. I'm just

1145
04:36:28,549 --> 04:36:41,700
gonna do it by myself. How come you're not taking the spear that you made 15 years ago?

1146
04:36:42,500 --> 04:36:54,659
It's dull. All right where am I going to keep going up? Where the hell were those?

1147
04:36:57,080 --> 04:37:01,159
There's eggs up there. Maybe we should get those too. No it's just a branch.

1148
04:37:03,080 --> 04:37:17,740
What about this? Is this like a new species of plant or something? Bird? Can I like identify

1149
04:37:17,740 --> 04:37:40,150
the bird? Let's go up here. These have to be so high up. You can't just put these like I'm like

1150
04:37:40,150 --> 04:37:48,419
around. I hate me. Consume the bird? I don't think I can do that.

1151
04:38:45,560 --> 04:38:50,040
You just like sometimes you just have to like take a leap of faith to and I'm gonna die. I'm

1152
04:38:50,040 --> 04:38:56,900
gonna fall off and die probably. I just was trying to get this shit and sometimes it's hard to tell

1153
04:38:56,900 --> 04:39:01,299
what's even grabbable and what's not grabbable. Like I can't grab those. I can't I can only grab

1154
04:39:01,299 --> 04:39:03,540
the vines. I can grab the trunks. I can grab the branches.

1155
04:39:15,319 --> 04:39:23,080
I don't even like fucking remember where like just I'm gonna just go all the way to the top

1156
04:39:23,080 --> 04:39:31,849
of the damn tree. This is an Assassin's Creed. It was made by the same guy that made Assassin's

1157
04:39:31,849 --> 04:40:11,799
Creed. It may as well be. Give me that. How can I stand? Do I have to sleep to cure a broken bone?

1158
04:40:12,360 --> 04:40:20,470
Fuck you bird. I almost got him.

1159
04:40:26,380 --> 04:40:30,540
Give me the other one. I have two of these things now. That's all I wanted.

1160
04:41:00,330 --> 04:41:02,409
The red or green plant will heal bones.

1161
04:41:08,299 --> 04:41:12,459
Where can I find one of those? I guess I'm just gonna have to. I want just to bring these back to

1162
04:41:12,540 --> 04:41:49,529
have at the camp. I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. There's one over there. This game we go with

1163
04:41:49,529 --> 04:41:57,740
multiplayer. I've been playing for about five hours. I still don't understand what the fuck the

1164
04:41:57,740 --> 04:42:04,700
point of the game is. What am I supposed to what do you mean that you just you just exist?

1165
04:42:09,479 --> 04:42:34,009
Just live? To evolve? Into what? Become a caveman? Is that even in the game?

1166
04:42:40,709 --> 04:42:58,150
No. What do you mean no? Are you just a monkey the whole time?

1167
04:43:08,459 --> 04:43:15,560
Yes. No. No. Yeah. No. We're getting some 50-50 responses here.

1168
04:43:17,900 --> 04:43:19,180
All right. Here's the red thing that I wanted.

1169
04:43:36,860 --> 04:43:47,000
Is this working? What's wrong with me?

1170
04:43:47,720 --> 04:44:45,540
My phone is re-broken. I'm just trying to fix myself and and I'm poisoned from the berries.

1171
04:44:46,340 --> 04:45:15,939
What happened? To evolve? I don't have any children guys. Who even is this and where are they?

1172
04:45:18,939 --> 04:45:31,849
That was kind of sad. Yeah it was. Restart the game with your knowledge of how to play.

1173
04:45:37,049 --> 04:45:57,909
Should I just do that? But I'm not sure I have that much knowledge on how to play the game.

1174
04:45:57,909 --> 04:46:03,900
I didn't understand. I don't think I have the knowledge you're you're referring to.

1175
04:46:25,830 --> 04:46:33,619
Read the no I I know like the basic understanding but should I just restart?

1176
04:46:35,290 --> 04:46:42,279
Read the help section? No I I know all we mean we did this already.

1177
04:46:53,380 --> 04:47:06,220
Yeah like I understand this stuff. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Okay when you access the

1178
04:47:06,220 --> 04:47:09,259
Neural Engineering development you use the Neural Engineering by surviving to grow the neurons.

1179
04:47:09,259 --> 04:47:13,659
Okay it will increase your capacities. When you access your neural network ready for reinforcement

1180
04:47:13,659 --> 04:47:25,049
it means you can pass generations right? Okay but I already knew that. The problem has not been

1181
04:47:25,049 --> 04:47:28,650
about progressing in the game. The problem has been running into tigers that spawn on top of me.

1182
04:47:44,869 --> 04:48:05,849
The combat page? The combat page is two sentences. Hold A to prime dodging. Release A. What do you

1183
04:48:05,930 --> 04:48:26,139
mean? I just read them. I know I already knew that shit. What's that?

1184
04:48:32,630 --> 04:49:30,569
What's your enemy? A boar? I ain't giving up. Not yet. Nope. I ain't giving up. Who died over there?

1185
04:49:30,569 --> 04:49:52,459
Okay there's somebody died there. I can already read the patch notes for version 1.1.

1186
04:49:52,459 --> 04:49:56,310
Reduce the spawn rate of the tiger by like 30 fucking thousand percent.

1187
04:49:57,180 --> 04:50:25,770
This is the last one. This is the only monkey I have left.

1188
04:50:29,479 --> 04:50:34,520
Hold and release. I'm gonna ban the word. I'm gonna ban the word hold and release.

1189
04:50:35,959 --> 04:50:40,759
I didn't have a spirit in my hand and by the way even I'm banning the word. I'm banning hold and

1190
04:50:40,759 --> 04:51:01,930
release. Hold and release does not stop the fact that I'm surrounded by there are more tigers than

1191
04:51:01,930 --> 04:51:29,770
people. There's another monkey over there I think. Found him. Hey you. Follow me. You and me are

1192
04:51:29,770 --> 04:51:39,959
friends now. You understand? Let's go. People are donating to say that. Don't even do that. That's

1193
04:51:39,959 --> 04:51:50,060
that's a waste of money. Don't do that. Okay follow me. Uh there's two of us. Wait what are

1194
04:51:50,060 --> 04:51:56,139
you? Are you female? Male? Am I male? Are you female? What is it? Let me know. I'm doing this.

1195
04:51:56,139 --> 04:52:07,400
I'm starting over in mid-game. Come here. What are you? Male. What am I? Who am I? What am I?

1196
04:52:13,180 --> 04:52:21,540
Shit. No wait. That's good. Right? Yes. It's good. Come here. Yes. Come here.

1197
04:52:23,639 --> 04:52:26,279
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

1198
04:52:26,279 --> 04:52:44,459
We can start over. We can do this. You and I. Come on. No. I'm trying to turn off the emote only mode.

1199
04:52:44,459 --> 04:53:16,979
How do I turn? I don't. I know how to turn it on. I don't turn it off. Got it. Okay. Now I need a bed.

1200
04:53:18,569 --> 04:53:21,930
Okay. We already got some stuff here. There's a stick. There's sticks here.

1201
04:53:23,529 --> 04:53:32,779
I see a couple of rocks. I just want to make a bed. Or no. Just follow me back. We're already

1202
04:53:32,779 --> 04:53:51,990
here. There's one, two, three, four dead up there. So many dead people up here. This doesn't feel

1203
04:53:51,990 --> 04:53:56,630
right. I don't think I can. I don't think we can like have kids up here. This doesn't feel right.

1204
04:53:57,349 --> 04:54:47,900
Okay. Evolve first. Didn't I already do that? Like I'm talking like an hour like 45 minutes ago now.

1205
04:54:47,900 --> 04:55:25,479
Didn't I do that already? Because I don't have any points. I can't reach here. No. I have nothing

1206
04:55:25,479 --> 04:55:32,840
else to do. I need to like survive out there with kids around me. But surviving out there

1207
04:55:32,840 --> 04:55:56,580
has deemed to be very, very, very difficult. Evolution leap. What? What is this? When evolving

1208
04:55:56,580 --> 04:56:00,900
through ages, all spontaneous mutation neurons are not carried by adults or elves but vanish.

1209
04:56:00,900 --> 04:56:03,700
But then matter may reappear in future babies. Do you still want to evolve?

1210
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:31,860
Just what the fuck even is this? What? What? What? What? There was nothing told me about that.

1211
04:56:31,939 --> 04:56:48,950
Zero. Did not tell me to do this. 24,000 fucking years. 24,000 more years. Obsidian is a tool.

1212
04:56:48,950 --> 04:57:09,529
I used it twice. I intimidated a warthog. We gained 50,000 years. Is there a reason why the game

1213
04:57:09,529 --> 04:57:24,119
would not tell you that this existed? It's going too fast. Oh shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1214
04:57:24,680 --> 04:57:42,490
I would... I even looked at this screen and I thought these were just like achievements. Dude,

1215
04:57:42,490 --> 04:57:45,290
I don't... This is happening. There's too much happening on the screen right now. I don't know

1216
04:57:45,290 --> 04:57:55,720
what's going on. It's almost a million years. The game doesn't tell you mechanics so you learn?

1217
04:57:56,520 --> 04:58:04,470
I don't think this is a game mechanic. I think this is a menu option. Game mechanic would be

1218
04:58:04,470 --> 04:58:12,619
like finding herbs and spices and shit. I think this is a very important screen to know

1219
04:58:12,700 --> 04:58:41,750
what it does. This is five hours of stuff.

1220
04:58:54,970 --> 04:59:07,459
You've 102,000 evolved faster than science. I went 819,000 years. What? Hey, wait, that's not fair.

1221
04:59:14,919 --> 04:59:19,880
Evolving slow. Okay, more deaths than births. So that means you don't exist.

1222
04:59:28,580 --> 04:59:32,740
You have moved forward through time to nine to four million, whatever, years before now,

1223
04:59:32,740 --> 04:59:43,669
and will be brought back to the world to catch up with your lineage. That is an insanely important

1224
04:59:43,669 --> 05:00:10,340
fucking core game that not... Well, you didn't know it existed either. Neither did I. Why is

1225
05:00:10,340 --> 05:00:40,459
it year 36? Did anything change? Who am I? Anybody here? Is it just... Am I the only one that made it?

1226
05:00:41,099 --> 05:01:02,619
Where's my bed? Okay, who are you? Adult female. All right, I...

1227
05:01:05,990 --> 05:01:30,759
I'm going out on my own. New thing. I can't fucking believe I was there for five hours

1228
05:01:30,840 --> 05:01:36,819
and didn't know. I can't believe it. I am fucking... I'm shocked right now.

1229
05:01:37,779 --> 05:02:07,880
All right, get the honey. Get it. How do I get honey? Oh, okay. I got some more senses. Can you

1230
05:02:07,880 --> 05:02:16,380
grab it? I don't think you can grab honey. You need to do a couple more feats to evolve as a

1231
05:02:16,380 --> 05:02:24,659
species, okay? So let's just grab a few sticks and do the thing I did already. Strip the weeds.

1232
05:02:26,500 --> 05:02:30,580
I know how to... No, I don't know how to do that apparently. All right, what do I want to do?

1233
05:02:30,580 --> 05:02:47,990
I need to go over here, find one of these other things. Let's go this way. Okay, I'm going to

1234
05:02:47,990 --> 05:03:04,759
find the evolved tiger. Yeah, that shit was un-fucking-believable. Oh, you okay? I need to

1235
05:03:04,759 --> 05:03:18,439
help you. I got a headache. What can I do for a headache? Something for a headache? That's not

1236
05:03:18,439 --> 05:03:25,189
food. You're looking for war or something. I need to...

1237
05:04:10,520 --> 05:05:13,930
I can't. What do I do? Why is he still alive? Get off of him. Run away, you idiot. Stupid dumb

1238
05:05:13,930 --> 05:06:14,409
tiger. Is he all right? What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, guys? I'm just going to remember.

1239
05:06:14,409 --> 05:06:51,110
Can I not climb up any of this? All right, I did my... Did it work? It worked from this far away.

1240
05:06:54,180 --> 05:06:58,099
Okay, let me... Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is fruits and shit. I need to heal.

1241
05:06:58,740 --> 05:07:12,810
I think I need a rock to break these open. I don't think I can just eat these. I'm pretty

1242
05:07:12,810 --> 05:07:20,020
sure I can't. Where did they even go? No, I can't. Okay, I'm going to bring these. We're

1243
05:07:20,020 --> 05:07:26,380
going to smash it with a rock. I'm going to give them to him because the tiger's gone. Where are

1244
05:07:26,380 --> 05:07:41,770
the other two that fell? Right here? These things. Okay, I got one, apparently. Where?

1245
05:07:54,869 --> 05:07:58,310
I'm bleeding out. I know, but I have to go get one of these fucking things.

1246
05:07:59,430 --> 05:08:29,529
It's a story of my life. No fall joke? No. You healed yourself from bleeding. That's a feat.

1247
05:08:29,529 --> 05:08:47,400
I need like a couple more feats. Can I break this open? Metabolism. What exactly am I doing

1248
05:08:47,400 --> 05:09:04,869
with this? Oh, this is the nut. It's a big nut. Let's break this open and eat it. It's a coconut.

1249
05:09:04,869 --> 05:09:15,049
Okay, can I do anything else with this? Can I? I think I do have to smash this with a rock,

1250
05:09:15,049 --> 05:09:31,560
I think. Yeah, okay, I can smash it with a rock. Is he still alive? Tiger's gone, right?

1251
05:09:32,939 --> 05:09:51,159
Give me a rock so I can break this open. Any rock will do. Any rock will do. I'll take any rock in

1252
05:09:51,159 --> 05:09:59,139
the whole world and on earth. Any rock will do. I wish I could pick you up. I need a rock

1253
05:09:59,860 --> 05:10:22,200
so I can give this to you. I wish I could put like something. I wish I had like a monkey inventory

1254
05:10:23,240 --> 05:10:40,299
because now I gotta find a rock. Give me, please. He's really hungry. Right here. No, those are

1255
05:10:40,299 --> 05:11:15,610
mushrooms. Just eat them. No, don't eat those. Oh, hold on. Berries. Are these poisonous? Hey,

1256
05:11:15,610 --> 05:11:23,220
I learned self-control. I would have loved to give you a berry, but that guy said I'm gonna

1257
05:11:23,220 --> 05:11:49,619
have to leave him. Just put everything down and fucking get out of here. I can't even get up the

1258
05:11:49,619 --> 05:12:09,430
fucking tree. Climb the tree. I'm learning dodge. Well, that's good. I'm just farming points.

1259
05:12:09,430 --> 05:12:35,830
Whatever, we got a stream drop? We're good. Guess what I need now? I need another one of those

1260
05:12:35,830 --> 05:12:47,319
things to rub on my fucking body. And he's just guarding this fucking tiger. This is always around

1261
05:12:47,319 --> 05:12:53,080
no matter what you do or where you go. There's always a tiger. There's always a fucking tiger.

1262
05:12:53,080 --> 05:12:57,240
And tigers come out like for five minutes a day, guys. They don't fucking do this.

1263
05:12:58,680 --> 05:13:22,250
And then they go to stay asleep. I have no like depth here. What am I looking at? What are you

1264
05:13:22,250 --> 05:13:24,729
looking at? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you

1265
05:13:24,729 --> 05:13:35,659
looking at? What? Oh, it's been a whole day. Okay. Is he still just down? Of course he's down there.

1266
05:13:36,299 --> 05:13:53,270
Just always expect that there's always a tiger everywhere no matter what. This whole game is

1267
05:13:53,270 --> 05:14:10,490
tigers. Ancestors. Monkeys ran away from tigers based on four bones we found. Okay, can I heal

1268
05:14:10,490 --> 05:14:24,860
this guy? That's not gonna hurt me, right? Thank God. Okay, come here, please. What the fuck was

1269
05:14:24,860 --> 05:14:35,669
that? What just happened? What happened? How did my character die? I wasn't bleeding. I just healed

1270
05:14:35,669 --> 05:14:53,290
myself. I just healed myself. I'm just trying. All right, no more rescuing other people.

1271
05:15:01,380 --> 05:15:48,360
The tiger shot me. God damn it. Well, I... Shit. Your circle was so minuscule that the act of walking

1272
05:15:48,439 --> 05:15:56,549
killed you. Oh, that sucks. Is this water? Let me just drink some of this fucking water.

1273
05:15:59,990 --> 05:16:11,830
You get zero xp unless you have a baby on your back. Am I scared of the water too? What is it?

1274
05:16:11,830 --> 05:16:22,979
What am I looking at here? Lily pads? Are you scared of lily pads? No, it's a fishing spot.

1275
05:16:22,979 --> 05:16:46,869
So what's the problem? Relax. All right, where... Let me go over here. I'm just gonna sleep.

1276
05:16:47,590 --> 05:16:57,990
Do I have a thing here? This is where he spawned. Is there a bed?

1277
05:17:00,630 --> 05:17:03,270
All right, am I gonna have to make one?

1278
05:17:13,720 --> 05:17:17,560
Stay in the trees? Well, I would love to stay in the trees, but half the stuff I have to do,

1279
05:17:17,560 --> 05:17:31,979
I have to be on the ground. Dig in this hole. Pick up this rock. Grab a stick off the plant.

1280
05:17:32,540 --> 05:18:02,389
Okay, I can dig. I can dig. I need a stick. I also need to go to sleep somewhere.

1281
05:18:07,110 --> 05:18:12,250
I don't even know where the hell that even is. I guess I have a camp somewhere.

1282
05:18:13,369 --> 05:18:20,630
I'm here. Might as well put it on the... Whatever. Just sleep on the floor? Let me go.

1283
05:18:20,630 --> 05:18:37,220
There's like other people. There's like apes over here. Where is this other person on the map?

1284
05:18:38,340 --> 05:18:47,000
Who the fuck is this? Where are you? Are you just lying? Oh, you're like camouflaged. It's a baby.

1285
05:18:47,000 --> 05:19:27,990
Come here. All right, baby. Time to learn. What do I want to do now? I'm teaching the baby about

1286
05:19:27,990 --> 05:19:59,240
the world. Okay, so this is... I don't know. I don't think I have anybody left. I need to find

1287
05:19:59,240 --> 05:20:04,619
somebody. So here's how the course of action is going to be. Find somebody that's in need of a

1288
05:20:04,619 --> 05:20:11,979
new clan. Start the process of getting to know them, and then we both die by a tiger in 10

1289
05:20:11,979 --> 05:20:15,819
seconds. So let's just continue the same cycle we've been doing for the last two and a half hours.

1290
05:20:30,709 --> 05:20:38,520
Sounds good to me. Let's get a rock and make this a spear, and then we have to go find something.

1291
05:20:38,520 --> 05:21:13,580
I need to sleep too. Get off the tree. Sharp. I need a rock. Teach the baby about taxes.

1292
05:21:14,950 --> 05:21:20,099
I think we're just going to sleep somewhere. Can I sleep in a tree? I didn't want to do that.

1293
05:21:20,819 --> 05:21:39,900
We can't just sleep all the way up there. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to find a place to sleep.

1294
05:21:40,459 --> 05:22:01,619
I have to sleep in the bird's nest. Now I gotta find sticks, make a bed, or go up and sleep. And

1295
05:22:01,619 --> 05:22:19,459
let me try to sleep in a tree. Can I like just find a spot where we can lie down? I don't think so.

1296
05:22:20,099 --> 05:22:36,819
I have to make a bed. Make the bed on the tree. That's gonna be pain in the ass because I have

1297
05:22:36,819 --> 05:22:42,099
to bring individual... two individual sticks up here. Like five of them, and then stomp on it.

1298
05:22:42,819 --> 05:22:51,220
But I'll try. Well, there's a rock. I need that.

1299
05:23:19,990 --> 05:23:34,900
While I do this, don't pass out. All right, I got a weapon. I need some sticks.

1300
05:23:37,659 --> 05:23:49,909
Rocks. No sticks. No, like, leaves. I need to eat something too. I got... let's go find it.

1301
05:23:58,389 --> 05:24:03,430
Go tiger hunting. It's revenge time. I'm not going to kill that tiger. There's not a chance

1302
05:24:03,430 --> 05:24:12,330
in hell. Okay, right here. Put down a branch. Give me another one. Is there any more? That's

1303
05:24:12,330 --> 05:24:37,930
the only thing that was here? Come on. Tiger joke waiting room. Yeah, don't worry. You'll see it

1304
05:24:37,930 --> 05:25:11,369
again. Give me fish. Switching hands every time. It's just... what the hell? Why would you? Why do

1305
05:25:11,369 --> 05:25:28,470
I have to switch fucking hands for everything? I can't do this with my other hand? If I could do

1306
05:25:28,470 --> 05:25:31,830
it with my right hand, why would I not be smart enough to know I could do the same thing with my

1307
05:25:31,830 --> 05:25:57,619
other hand? Because it's dumb. All right. Okay, where is my right-handed? Yeah, I mean, like,

1308
05:25:57,619 --> 05:26:15,240
ultra right-handed. I want this. Is this ready? Keep that in the pile. It's not ready. I need,

1309
05:26:15,240 --> 05:26:50,569
like, one more. I can get that. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Wrong hand. Baby's hungry. Doesn't the baby eat

1310
05:26:50,569 --> 05:27:12,040
when you eat? Oh, I got rock. Here we go. A, up, and then let go of A.

1311
05:28:01,750 --> 05:28:15,990
Wait a minute. This is the final baby. I need to live. Climb something. Climb a tree.

1312
05:28:33,700 --> 05:28:52,139
Where is he? Why is it still doing this? Why are you doing this? The tiger cannot climb trees.

1313
05:28:52,779 --> 05:29:17,740
Speaking of trees, I need food. I need to eat something. I still hear the tiger screaming.

1314
05:29:35,259 --> 05:29:43,689
Find a hiding spot. I mean, I think this looks like a hiding spot to me.

1315
05:29:44,330 --> 05:30:12,619
Fucking orb is up here. Okay, so try and tell me that the orb is in the fucking sky. No,

1316
05:30:12,619 --> 05:30:23,669
I'm not jumping. No, I gotta find the monkey. He's pretty good. He's pretty good. He's pretty

1317
05:30:23,669 --> 05:31:01,209
strong. I heard the tiger. Just like in Dark Souls. Dark Souls 1. The tree. What are you doing? Let

1318
05:31:01,209 --> 05:31:19,509
go. Turn this way. I'm not even holding on to anything. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got

1319
05:31:19,509 --> 05:32:22,099
it. Tiger's still waiting for me down here. I'm looking for, like, a hiding spot or something.

1320
05:32:31,139 --> 05:33:18,810
I'm good. Okay, get up. That tiger is doing great. Yes, he is. Dead. Fish. Rock. Can I pick stuff up

1321
05:33:18,810 --> 05:33:36,819
as a baby? Holy shit, I can. Why can I do this? I can't strip it, though. Where's the... I can't.

1322
05:33:37,380 --> 05:33:44,310
I need somebody to do this for me. I gotta make a bed? No, I can't be on the ground for more than

1323
05:33:44,310 --> 05:34:26,599
fucking 30 seconds, otherwise... The bed was over here. Can I sleep into an adult? Why did I go back

1324
05:34:26,599 --> 05:35:11,819
here? If I die, the game ends. Yeah, I think I'm all right with that. No, wrong item. I can't pick

1325
05:35:11,819 --> 05:35:31,590
up the fucking spear. I'm trying to pick the spear up. I got it. I got the spear. No, this... No.

1326
05:35:32,150 --> 05:35:41,860
Every button is fucking A. Pick up, jump, run, fall down. No way. I don't even know where it went.

1327
05:35:41,860 --> 05:36:03,529
I want to just grab the spear and see if I can stab him. This is like... No, this is like...

1328
05:36:36,599 --> 05:36:54,970
You can't fight a tiger as a baby. What with my options? Where does this start? I just seen that

1329
05:36:54,970 --> 05:37:05,540
on Planet Earth. Yeah, I've never seen a... Never mind. No, I'm just a fucking baby again.

1330
05:37:07,180 --> 05:37:53,220
This ain't happening. Come on, motherfucker. Let's go. What you got? This is my last stand. Okay,

1331
05:37:53,220 --> 05:38:08,069
so hold A, towards him, audio cue, let go of A. I probably should know what this does first.

1332
05:38:09,319 --> 05:39:35,430
As a baby. No, I know what this is. I saw dad do this. There he is. Damn it. First time?

1333
05:39:40,279 --> 05:40:05,900
Custom game? Region? The jungle? Settlement? Rockslide? Oasis? Clan size? Medium? Okay.

1334
05:40:06,819 --> 05:40:26,229
Delete tigers. What is easy mode? I don't even know what that means. Find yourself alone somewhere

1335
05:40:26,229 --> 05:40:44,549
in Africa 10 million years ago. Let's try this one. No, no, not this one. One guy told me to pick

1336
05:40:44,549 --> 05:40:59,029
this. This is hardcore. Okay. Well, no, I ain't fucking doing that. I just quit the whole game,

1337
05:40:59,029 --> 05:41:22,279
actually. For the best. We're going to play something else. Rage quit? No, my entire lineage

1338
05:41:22,279 --> 05:41:50,459
was killed. That's not a rage quit. That's like a, I was wiped out. Go play WoW Classic. Oh no,

1339
05:41:50,459 --> 05:42:00,090
no way. I'm going to play that right now. Let me go, let me go get a drink. Let me pee and we'll

1340
05:42:00,090 --> 05:42:01,610
do something else for a little while. I'll be back.
