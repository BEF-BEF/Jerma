1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:18,489
Hey, how are you? Vod, yeah, well, I mean, this is the start of the Vod, you're right. How are you

2
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:43,539
doing? Give me one second. Did the tweet go through? Let me check. Yeah, it did. Good afternoon,

3
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:51,380
everybody, or good evening. Show us the green. Today is not the green screen stream. The green

4
00:00:51,380 --> 00:01:04,730
screen stream is scheduled for Thursday, so Thursday will get you a solid time. What's

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,250
happening today? Well, I figured we'd just hang out for a little bit, chat and talk about,

6
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,900
you know, about my taxes. And maybe you guys can help me with them.

7
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Trying to figure out what is and was it is in an expense, you know, it's hard stuff.

8
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,599
Now, we're probably gonna play LA Noire and Red Dead 2. And then maybe a little bit of

9
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:38,790
of the new, what was that new? Not Binding of Isaac, whatever it was. Both games? No,

10
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:49,290
I think we're good. Oh, there I am. Oh, hi. Hi, the webcam works. Delta, oh,

11
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,329
that Delta rune. That's what it was. Binding of Isaac. Why did I think of Binding of Isaac?

12
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:58,090
Strange. Anyways, we'll just take a minute here. I can turn off the intro.

13
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:02,250
Oh, no, maybe the intro should stay on for a little longer. What do you think?

14
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:11,460
I'm weird about my intros, man. I believe my normal streamers, right? If you're a normal

15
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:23,659
streamer, how long do you have your intro on for? More than five minutes? One minute?

16
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:35,780
30 minutes? 30 minutes? Oh, it's been three minutes. Should I give it five minutes? I don't

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:54,389
have any time frame here. 30 seconds. Well, regardless, 10 minutes is good. Five minutes

18
00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:02,939
is all right for me, I think. So, I mean, we're at four minutes now. You're always talking

19
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,620
before I get the alert and come in. Well, all right, so I need to learn how to do this

20
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,629
thing. I need to learn how to stream. So, I hit the start streaming button. But I want

21
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:19,000
people to know that I didn't accidentally press start streaming, you know? We could turn it

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,120
off. Let's just get to what I want to do. I want to hang out for a little bit.

23
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:29,780
I don't know what this is. This is different. This is like vertical video on a cell phone.

24
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,969
And no, there's no green screen back here. Take a look. See, it's not like, oh,

25
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:44,020
he's going to fall through it. This is just, see? This is a wall. This is really a wall.

26
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,919
How weird would it be if I was inside of a box inside of a green screen?

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,469
Well, whatever. I like your Nightwing shirt. I did too. So, today, I just figured we just,

28
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:04,680
we wouldn't really do much. Probably sit around and do it wider. I don't feel like doing it.

29
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:15,449
It's too far away for me. Chill stream. We're just going to hang out, talk, relax.

30
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,949
Do you feel a little lazy, you know? Feel a little bit lazy today. That's kind of what

31
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:29,720
we're doing. But LA Noire is on the list. So is Red Dead 2. But we haven't had an opportunity

32
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,990
to do this, just to sit here, you know? It hasn't been a very much of an opportunity for

33
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:50,339
us to just kind of hang out here because, I mean, sorry, I've got a little bit of wine

34
00:04:50,339 --> 00:05:00,339
here. Don't mind me. This is wine, you know? I only drink wine during one particular type

35
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:09,750
of stream. I'm not sure. That's nice. That's fruity. That's got some notes to it. That's

36
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,579
got some blueberry in an oak cask. But, you know, the only time that I ever drink wine

37
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:26,069
on stream is when I'm doing something very particular on camera. Why am I not? Why is

38
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:34,600
it not in a cup? It isn't a cup. But let's speed it up here because I think a lot of

39
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,360
people are probably really curious as to what the deal is. I'm going to go ahead and switch

40
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,199
it over to LA Noire because that's exactly what we're doing. And we're definitely not

41
00:05:42,199 --> 00:06:07,610
doing the Nintendo Labo vehicle kit. Yeah, that's right. We're doing the Labo today.

42
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:17,860
Anytime. Anytime I put wine in a glass. Let's go ahead and put me down here. Down

43
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,540
here where I belong in the corner here. Oh, what's that out here? Do you guys

44
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:37,350
hear that? You guys hear that? Oh, okay. Where is it though? It should be here.

45
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,500
The best part of both is I was supposed to do this

46
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,939
yesterday. You understand? I was supposed to be in the middle of LA Noire and just

47
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:57,220
open this box and start doing it. So you didn't really work out because I

48
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,819
there's a couple of problems there. But who gives a shit? Like we're here now and we're

49
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,100
going to do it now. I'm excited for it. I know like 60% of the audience is like,

50
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:24,459
I can't believe I'm doing this again. But let's go ahead and open it. I need to move

51
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:33,850
this forward. Whoops. Oh boy, this is a little I don't know how I'm going to like

52
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:46,009
do this. I don't have enough room for this. This is so you guys understand this is like

53
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:52,389
I don't have anything. I can't move. I'm stuck here. You understand like this is locking me

54
00:07:52,389 --> 00:08:06,139
in. And the camera's right here. That's good wine too, by the way. Oh, what kind of expensive

55
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:15,779
wine are you drinking tonight? Well, you know, the finest fucking box wine. I gotta

56
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,699
be careful with that though. Because like, if that shit like I can't spill any of that.

57
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,019
So say goodbye. Honestly, do you think there's gonna be like a spill the fucking wine

58
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:32,899
joke tonight? No, no, no, no, I'm not I know that's not gonna happen. I can't afford that.

59
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,879
Anyways, we're gonna just get this fucking thing out of here. Let's do make because

60
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:50,220
I'm ready to go. Am I having problems? Please take a picture of this QR code. There we go.

61
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,059
Okay, so I don't know what pieces I need. This is gonna be apparently from all the reviews

62
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:00,860
I read. This is apparently way way more fun. It has the games are actually like three or four

63
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,019
times better than I don't know why three or four is the number of new here. Apparently,

64
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:09,340
it's like three times better game wise than the other labos. This is apparently the other

65
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,580
labos with dog shit in comparison. So we'll find out. I got my I got my controllers here.

66
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go ahead and make. First, we'll practice. I don't need to practice.

67
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,340
I already know how to make the fucking popcorn holder. I don't need to do this.

68
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm gonna change this from like the from just chatting to Nintendo labo vehicle kit.

69
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:54,409
Vehicle kit. Let lab go. Let's just have a vehicle. Fuck is that person running?

70
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:03,049
How about a making car automobile factory? Well, it's not just cars, vehicle factory.

71
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,679
Vehicle factory one worker, right? Because I mean, that would be kind of fucked up. But that's

72
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:25,720
that's reality here. I gotta make them all. Okay, labo. Okay, that's done. I'm ready.

73
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,379
This is actually kind of good. This is a red blend California red blend from black box

74
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:42,809
premium box wine. My plan is, you know, to stall. No, don't stall this. This shit

75
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,850
takes like eight hours to build. Don't stop stalling. It's gonna be like a nine and a

76
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,610
half hour stream. Look at how good I look right now. I look fresh. I look well rested. Fast

77
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,809
forward seven and a half hours from now. I bet you my hair is greasy. My face is watery.

78
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:06,980
And like I got stains under my armpits. $50 just came in. Baked flakes. Thank you for

79
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,740
the 50 fucking dollars. And he says, italics says you have small cups. How dare you force

80
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:26,230
germicides cups onto your housemates. Eat these bits on stream. This is this is eight ounces.

81
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:32,149
This is a this is what a human being is supposed to consume for a serving. Six to eight ounces.

82
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,860
Just stop going to Burger King and getting the large like 38 ounce fucking beverage. It's

83
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,090
gonna kill you one day. This is the amount of ounces a waffle one serving. You know,

84
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,850
you drink those bottles of water, those are 16.9 fluid ounces. That's two servings.

85
00:11:48,809 --> 00:12:04,679
Call a doctor and ask him. Call a doctor. Call a doctor and ask. I don't even think

86
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:11,740
he can hear me. But thanks for the $50 man so much. Seriously. I don't need practice. Thank

87
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:20,980
you baked flakes. It's a lot of money. We already know this part. Okay, that was weird.

88
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:29,899
Go. Go. I already know this part. Is there a way to skip the baby shit? I think we have to

89
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:39,529
do this. Yeah, if you hold this, I don't even need this baby shit. Yeah, hold these and go

90
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:47,259
back and forth. Or baby shit. It's a game for little kids. Actually, one of the reviewers said

91
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:54,039
that it took him and his son a very long time to make it. He said that, you know, it was

92
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,840
really hard for me. My son was there too, but I thought it was pretty difficult at points.

93
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:09,720
And I'm like, okay, well, all right. Stop making things up. I swear to God, that's a

94
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,240
review for this labo. Just type in labo review me and my son or something and you'll just find

95
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:25,129
it. Do like how people find anything on the internet. You're the father. Congrats.

96
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:40,440
Shave your scruff. Listen, anytime that I shave, I only have to shave like once a week

97
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,000
because my face should be grow so slow and so radically thick. And I have sensitive skin,

98
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,960
right? I have sensitive teeth. So I need special toothpaste and any special shaving cream

99
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,240
because if I shave, I get red and itchy and it's bad. So I have to use sensitive toothpaste

100
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,360
for my sensitive teeth and then sensitive soap for my sensitive face. I don't want to shave

101
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,480
every day. All right, so we're going to make a petal. 60 to 90 minutes. We're going to be

102
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:27,269
here all day. This is going to take a long fucking time. 90 minutes for just a fucking

103
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:33,210
petal. This is a mistake. This is like, this is a 10 minute joke that I wanted to make

104
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:40,980
and now it's a nine hour stream. Do you have chest? I don't have any chest here.

105
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:49,139
I guess unanimously people, okay. So there's, there's like the before and after labo streams,

106
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,940
right? Before labo and during labo, it was okay. But like after labo, it was like,

107
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,860
don't ever do that again. So like now, now we're just, now we're going to put on like a

108
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:11,419
high heel. I'm ready. Four steps. You need a complete base petal frame joy con. I've had

109
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,139
some practice. I'll be able to get this good. What do I need? And turn this fucking shitty

110
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:27,029
music down, Nintendo. There. Perfect. What was this? This is the best kit. That's what

111
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,190
I've been told by the guy that had the sun. The guy that had the sun. I told you.

112
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:40,179
Okay. We need the big, uh, Yoshi face, the big spitter from Jurassic park. That's what that is.

113
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:51,529
That's the, just that look at it. The spitter from Jurassic park. I don't care what anybody

114
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,529
says. That's the image that's on the screen. I would, I would have passed like the Rorschach

115
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:04,070
test or where is it a pedal a and it's the, it's the Rorschach, uh, Yoshi face.

116
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,179
This is the, looks like the one right here. Now I also need to move some stuff because I

117
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,389
can't trash this room. This is not a funny break stuff room because I just bought it.

118
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,539
You think I'm going to break it? I'm going to move this

119
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:28,379
sidewards. You know, let's move this, let's move this sidewards. Okay, I guess fine.

120
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,620
I want this trash bag. You know, make sure to put the trash bag in the table,

121
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,080
like underneath the legs and just drop it under the table. No, that's too much work.

122
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,370
All right. So I need to punch out, don't ruin these two pieces from sheet A. Don't forget

123
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,610
the tiny piece on the bottom. So this little thing right here. So how, how does that look?

124
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,389
Does this need to be adjusted? Let me adjust this camera because it is, it's, uh,

125
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:18,170
lights are changing in here. Shit. BenQ, why do you have to have these fucking touch pad

126
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:36,549
things? Just put buttons on like a regular fucking company. Okay. Where is it? Is there

127
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,490
a reason why I can't configure this? What the fuck is going on here?

128
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,559
Yes, I'd like to configure that video, please. Why the fuck is going on here?

129
00:17:50,279 --> 00:18:09,349
Why can I not configure? Configure! I just did it. Do I seriously, are you going to piss me off

130
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:14,039
this much? I don't even have it on my task bar or anything. I just can't even open the

131
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:22,460
fucking Logitech software. What the fuck was that? What the hell was that? My camera just

132
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:36,740
got struck by lightning. Configure. Thank you. Jesus. Who runs these companies? All right.

133
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:43,220
It looks good. And how's that? That's better, right? You can actually see what's going on here.

134
00:18:51,339 --> 00:19:02,089
Looks good. Okay. Let's go ahead and do it. That's that camera. That's that one. Move

135
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:11,960
this back so I can see it again. All right. BenQ. I have an idea for a great company

136
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:21,799
innovation. Instead of buttons, make really finicky touch buttons instead and waste electricity.

137
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:33,509
There goes that sponsorship. Hey, okay. Now I can see. Get it out of there.

138
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:46,009
60 to 90 minutes and it's already, we've already wasted 20. Is this good? Piece here and then

139
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:54,630
the little guy right there, a little dumbbell. Excellent. Make sure to put this in the,

140
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,950
do it. Don't be lazy about it. Put it in the trash. Well, recycle it because this is

141
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,460
going to go in the recycling. I don't need anything else from this, right? It comes more

142
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:11,819
like length. We have to like fold this shit and like pack it away neatly. Put it in the trash.

143
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:17,990
No, this is going into the recycling. Come on, guys. Come on. All right. We got the

144
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:34,740
first piece out. Just get like the first few pieces. All right. So we need this one from B.

145
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:49,859
So that top one B with the here. So which one is it? B. Is this not the right thing?

146
00:20:49,859 --> 00:21:00,329
Looks like it is. Why does this look wrong? Oh, it's like a giant treasure map. Okay.

147
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:13,079
This one. All right. That's good. Save that for now and let's start the assembling process.

148
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,240
Kids, don't forget if you have any trouble, you can use the back button. I know how it

149
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:26,099
works. So let's get started on this. Oh, the pedal. First up is the big piece here. Make sure

150
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,220
that you read Family Circus because that's the mother from Family Circus, which no longer is

151
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,740
even in print anymore. I don't think I think it was discontinued back like two or three years

152
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,460
ago. But man, it was it was a that was that was a that was in the funnies. All right. Make

153
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,779
sure you have plenty of space when working on big pieces. It might help to put away tiny

154
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:49,430
pieces you don't need. I know how to don't I know how to work this. Thank God that

155
00:21:49,430 --> 00:22:00,650
comic sucked. Yeah, that comic really? Seriously, like I hate this. I hate to like continue the

156
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,690
stall here. But I don't even need to stall. But seriously, that comic was just you guys think

157
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,210
Garfield was bad. Was it Family Circus? Like three panels and it was like boy is out playing.

158
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:18,839
Mother calls boy in for dinner. Boy comes in for dinner. That was it. There was no comedy.

159
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,740
All right, let's go. So we're gonna go this way. Nice increased. All these folds have to

160
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:35,619
happen. All of my this is not my first time, man. I just I can't it's too far. I'm just gonna

161
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:44,250
put it here for now. We have to vacuum this room. Come in for dinner. Okay. And he comes

162
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,490
in and he's like chocolate all over his mouth. Did you eat chocolate before coming in for dinner?

163
00:22:49,210 --> 00:23:14,819
Yeah. The kid looked like Bobby Hill. Like shrunk. Family Circus. Okay, dad. But that

164
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,700
trope is only happens when you're one or two years old, by the way. No, no, four or five,

165
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,180
six year old is getting like the giant mouth of chocolate all over their face.

166
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:34,779
It doesn't happen. You ready for that satisfying satisfaction? It's been a while since we've

167
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:49,750
heard that noise. How about the next one? What is wrong with me? I'm like embarrassed

168
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:56,359
right now because I saw the screen. I'm turning red. I saw the webcam. You can't hear it.

169
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,710
Look at the fucking dickhead in the car. That guy is probably a nice,

170
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:16,549
wonderful person. Who cares? So we got one, two, three. Same thing on the other side.

171
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,819
Is he drunk? I've had the equivalent of drinking like a glass of Welch's grape juice, guys.

172
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:55,589
That's not how it works. It's wine. That's not my walnut desk. Shit. Okay, that's all

173
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:03,480
right for now. Fuck you. All right, let's go. I got them all folded. Do we get these little

174
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,470
knobs here? All the little ones too or no? Yeah, I gotta go with the small ones. And then

175
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:22,920
bring in the big guy. Here we go. Wicked. Turmoil is never the same after moving to Vegas.

176
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:34,089
The Labo stream was like three or four months ago. The first one. So it came with me.

177
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,930
And the best part is I don't have to like destroy these. I can put these on, I'm gonna put them on

178
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,369
a shelf when I get like some of these, the pedal done. This is, this like size eight shoe

179
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:49,690
is going up on a shelf up here. I don't have to get rid of it. I don't have to like recycle it.

180
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:57,450
I recycle, yeah. Fucking problem with that. All right, over here. These have to punch out.

181
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,210
I'm just gonna say fuck it in a vacuum later. That's just the way it is.

182
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:20,359
Can we have a joke please? All right. Like you mean like a knock-knock type joke? What do you

183
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,519
mean like a story? Look at, look at how funny this story was. What? Did you, you didn't see

184
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:46,980
that part coming in the middle? Which kind? Anything. Okay. How about knock-knock is there.

185
00:26:49,779 --> 00:27:05,690
It's, it's the police. Police who? Open up. You are, you killed somebody. Now you're under

186
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:17,160
arrest. We know the body's in the fridge. All right. So wait, wait, wait. Let me get this

187
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:26,809
right. Like that, right? Okay. And this part comes down, snaps into place, and then this one

188
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:31,289
folds. Okay, that's what this little one's for. Let's, let's go. Oh, I'm sorry little one.

189
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:45,940
Connect from here to here. Right. And good. Make sure it's snug. Oh, this is way better

190
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,619
than, this is way better than the other two. This is way better. Sorry. This one folds,

191
00:27:52,619 --> 00:28:01,319
right? Where's that? Over here. This sticks into the, it's going to go in that slot right

192
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:08,869
there. Guarantee. I fucking guarantee it. Watch this. In she goes. Right in here.

193
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:16,630
Sunny side up. Can you guys see? I'm going to make sure the class, you guys are following

194
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,500
along, right? See the thing is, one of you guys got this for your birthday like a month ago

195
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,740
and you were like, holy shit, I'm never going to use that. But you're like, oh,

196
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,539
thanks grandma. It's been rotting in your closet for like two or three months.

197
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:34,339
And, but then you saw this stream turned on and you fucking sprinted as fast as you could to go

198
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:39,779
to the closet and grab it and like do it with me. Three of you did that. Okay. Beautiful.

199
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:44,539
Let's put these connected pieces to one side for a moment. Why would I need to take a break?

200
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,950
Take a break. All right. Well, there it is. Put, put two things together. What's,

201
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,390
what is Nintendo's obsession with breaks? Look, if I want to drink a box of wine

202
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:03,589
and play with a children's toy, I'm going to, I'm going to do that. Okay. Don't worry about me.

203
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:08,740
I'm going to be just fine. Like it's like Wii sports all over again. Are you sure there's

204
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,380
enough room? No, I'm not sure. I'm going to ruin my house. I'm going to start smashing stuff.

205
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,339
I'm going to break the vases and I'm going to break a couple of windows. I wasn't sure.

206
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:23,130
Thanks for reminding me. Okay. So you did these from C. Did they do that because they think

207
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,099
someone's going to sue them? You got to say, Hey, make sure you don't break any windows in

208
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:35,130
your house with the wii mode. Well, people would sort of actually do that. Can you imagine

209
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:43,109
if you like threw your wii mode into your TV and you were like, Nintendo did that?

210
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:50,569
What the fuck, Nintendo? Why'd you do that? You're going to waste the energy to call

211
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:54,819
and like get a lawyer. You're going to get a lawyer. Imagine explaining that to the lawyer.

212
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:01,059
Oh, yes. This is a PD Richards and sons. How can I help you? Hey,

213
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:07,380
I whipped a fucking heavy object into my TV and broke it and the company that sold me the thing.

214
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:32,519
I want to sue them. Hello. These two. All right. Is that all we need? Just,

215
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,839
just these one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four. Sorry. And this counted.

216
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,980
That's it, right? Thing is I don't want to get rid of these just yet because I need,

217
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,140
I need to track them down later. I had so much fun. God, I miss this.

218
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,779
You will need the rest of the pieces and see later. Is the music too loud? I'm turning it down.

219
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:05,579
Sort of like a pair of spoons, aren't they? I mean, no. Spoon. These are spoons.

220
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:18,660
Sort of like a pair of spoons. Okay. I'll flip them over to the other backs. Have you got

221
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,740
them facing the right way? I don't know. You just said they were spoons. How can I trust you

222
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:36,440
ever again? Okay. So now they're facing the right way. Fold them up. Wait, I gotta take,

223
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:44,390
I gotta take care of this. I love the people that are trickling into the stream right now.

224
00:31:45,190 --> 00:32:01,420
I just looked over at the chat and I saw not this again. Oh yeah. Make sure you, hey,

225
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,539
make sure you grab yourself a box wine. If you're at least the age of drinking in your

226
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,420
particular region or time zone. Drinking is by time zone. Specific time is allowed to start

227
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,140
drinking at five, four, five PM. Eastern time is not allowed to start drinking until

228
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,460
like five PM Eastern, which is, you know, it's by time zone. It's three 30 in the afternoon,

229
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:47,880
his Pacific. Oh yeah, it is. You know, like tons of information is racing through my brain

230
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,180
right now. Literally everything I've ever done is like racing through my mind. I just like,

231
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I just had a vision of me doing this and being like, holy shit, what a weirdo.

232
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:13,529
He's having, I'm having a crisis right now. It's happening. I'm too self-aware. I need to like

233
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:18,569
install like the 2013 German emulator and like run it in a virtual machine in my brain

234
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:30,809
because I'm like, I'm, what the fuck is happening right now? Old age. All right.

235
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:42,970
Wait, hold, hold this. I'm not breaking it. Was it a break? It's designed to be folded.

236
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:55,619
Half a glass of wine and already drunk. Listen, buddy, that ain't how it works.

237
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:04,150
Back in my heyday, I could drink this whole box and puke and be sick. And it was awful.

238
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,349
And it was never fun. It sucked every time. Don't fucking do it. It's not cool to drink too

239
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,269
much to the point where you fucking black out and get sick. Don't, it's not fucking fun.

240
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:26,579
Don't do it. All right. I need to, this could take like all day. I had this vision

241
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,179
in my brain that this was not going to take this long. Where's that piece?

242
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:43,340
He's at the fold up like that. Okay. Same thing with the other one. This is hard to do.

243
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:53,059
I'm sure I'm just seeing things. No, just don't, just, just be, just know your limits.

244
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:58,170
If your, if your limit is a box of wine, know it, know what it is.

245
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:10,090
Violent boomer destroys Nintendo Labo. Ah, I don't see anything destroyed at the moment. I

246
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:19,269
see a lot of, um, well-crafted, nice, very taking my time boomer playing with the Nintendo Labo.

247
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,929
So then these go through here. This is going to turn into like a little grill.

248
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:42,949
These fold, fold both of them. One is elf bowling. Just, you're going to have to get

249
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:53,420
the emulator for that one. Remember they're going to destroy this one like the piano.

250
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,659
No, I destroyed the piano because I didn't like the piano. Okay.

251
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:07,559
I like this one. Time to start putting everything together. Stand up with a bit like this.

252
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,050
What if you don't like that? I'm going to like this one. I already read the reviews.

253
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,969
Will you let me pay attention? So this one has to go. I like, this is cool. So this one

254
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:29,579
sticks in there like this, like that. That feels actually really nice. What a piece of shit.

255
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:42,179
All right. Looks good. Flip it around. It is all the, it is satisfying. It is.

256
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,329
Flip the whole thing over and we've got someone looks like to be at the twin.

257
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:55,769
It goes in here like this, right? Did somebody? No. Somebody gave money though.

258
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:09,590
$10 just came in from Shpee. Shpee shawl. Thank you for the 10 bucks, man. That's cool.

259
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:28,579
We need to, I need some more light. Don't you just see my information?

260
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:54,599
That's too much. And you will rise with the sun. No, that's, you can't see anything.

261
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,789
I just needed to point this way for a second. That's that one. All right. That looks okay.

262
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:10,280
That was a, that was not what I wanted to do. Like there. What is this? What is this? What is

263
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:25,019
this for? What is this for? What, what is this for? I don't know what this is for.

264
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,380
What do you do with this thing? It just sits there and looks nice for a second.

265
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:48,059
The box line is in the way. That's the problem. I'm like at a campfire.

266
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,739
Oh, forget it. It looks, it's fine. Crack this open a little bit. Just give me a second

267
00:38:53,739 --> 00:39:24,300
because it's like, it's too dark right here. There. Incoming joke. Nope. Incoming more light

268
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,980
so you can see. But I need to turn that off. I don't, I don't know what Phillips, you need to,

269
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,019
I need to ask somebody at Phillips a question. You've got a great product here.

270
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:46,219
Why am I so concerned about this? Like don't look at my password. Like what are you hiding?

271
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:58,860
Okay. That's better. All right. Back to it. Where's this going to go? Right here. That's

272
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:07,769
fine. Needed more light. All right. Those are both on. Let's check everything's properly

273
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:12,250
in place. Are your pieces neatly lined up like this? Yes, they are. Now we need from sheet B.

274
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:22,570
Wherever the hell, wherever the hell that is. This is sheet B. Show you taxes.

275
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:33,849
So I don't think, I don't think so. So we need the little M's. So we need one, two, three.

276
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:52,260
Build me a waifu. Well, this is a pedal. I don't, I don't think that's what you're asking

277
00:40:52,260 --> 00:41:01,980
for. I'm sorry. Let's go. It's a fan blade triplets labeled one, two, three, and they're

278
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:08,250
eager to join our slot party. Good thing we've got some more slots along the big pieces. Okay.

279
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,170
So I'm assuming we're going to go one, two, three. I know how to do this. It's going to go

280
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:36,090
bang, bang, bang. Look at that. Beautiful. So bang, two, bang. Yeah. Look at that.

281
00:41:36,090 --> 00:42:02,469
Look at that. Okay. Gift subs. Oh shit. Pocket Pondling has gifted five community subs. Cheers

282
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:09,460
to that, man. Thank you. Thanks to the five gifted community subs. You're the man.

283
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:19,190
Congratulations to those five lucky contestants. Finally bring back the pieces we started off

284
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:25,780
with. This thing. Get that over here. And this is going to be the guts. This is going

285
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:40,579
to be the real guts. Oh, this is popping out. Oh, fuck. Somebody. Okay. Matters of

286
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:45,179
Darkness. Thanks for the five community subs. We've got 10 gifted subs here from

287
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:53,690
Pocket Pondling and Matters of Darkness. Thank you both. Big subs coming in. Thank

288
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:01,820
you guys a lot. More gifts. You can't. Come on. They're gifts. All right. So lay them

289
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,980
out flat and place our slotty structure on top. It's a little tab. Should fit right into

290
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:18,710
the middle holes. What the hell are you talking about? Right here. Okay. That sticks just in.

291
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:43,909
Does it though? This tab is poking out. Those are in. As in as they can be. Okay. Looks just

292
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:50,179
like the on the box on the picture. Now fold it all up. This is the part that I love.

293
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,619
This is why you are all watching. To see this right here. This the skeleton closing

294
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:22,760
it over the muscles. The bone marrow, I mean. There you go. You ready? How many people would

295
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,000
have just left if I did that? You think? That was very satisfying. Okay. So then there's the

296
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,380
base pedal. Beginning to look like a proper base. Now grab this piece. The little hand glider

297
00:44:37,460 --> 00:45:00,139
from B. This one. Ah, okay. There it is. See the labo writing on it. So that one,

298
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:08,329
let's punch that out. Okay. Okay. That was inherently satisfying. It was.

299
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:15,659
Here's a pro tip. Skip. All of it is going to fall. Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold. Up,

300
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:18,300
up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. And then it's going to go in.

301
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:27,989
How does it go in? This is the part where he fucks it up. No, I got to get the camera

302
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:36,070
in a good spot after this because this is like, we're making a car. You better believe

303
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:45,699
I'm going to bring this to the green screen stream as a wheel and like a pedal. I'm gonna

304
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:52,659
gonna have a wheel in my hands. Okay, so that's that. This is a bird. This is

305
00:45:52,659 --> 00:46:04,710
gonna be a petal at the moment. Alright, where does it go? So this part turns

306
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,949
this way so you can see inside, and then flip the whole cover piece and we're

307
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:16,289
ready to get constructing. Like that. And then that goes, first is up with the

308
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:22,019
two tabs. The tops lie them both in at once. Like that. Okay, let me get

309
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:39,789
this folded. What about back here though? They all fold up. Okay, this is the part

310
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:46,699
where he fucks it up. Not quite. Not yet at least. Okay, then the bottom tab goes

311
00:46:46,699 --> 00:47:00,010
in. Slide it. Snap. And then side to side. Easy enough. Okay. Wait for the

312
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,639
crunch. Wait for the crunch. Oh, that was a little too much of a crunch.

313
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:20,880
Alright. Done. Ruined. I didn't ruin it. What are you talking about? It's perfect. Lo and

314
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,349
behold, we've completed the base of the petal. Alright, thanks everybody for

315
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:29,710
watching. That's gonna be the end of the labo segment of the stream. Now we're

316
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:39,550
gonna go on to part two. Oh, make sure you got your dongle bag. I gotta get the

317
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:48,289
dongle bag up here. So wait, what do I need? What pieces? Part two of 183.

318
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:51,650
Okay, making the actual petal. Make sure you've got the special dongle part

319
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,170
bag. You don't have to open it yet. Just know where it is. Okay, that's

320
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,849
fine. I know where it is. Remove this one piece. This is a big one.

321
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:13,119
Almost there. By the way, this is a game in itself. If I spill wine on the ground

322
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,320
tier, I lost a lot of money. So, like, just keep... That's a game,

323
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:37,409
essentially. What the... Pocket Polly just gave 10 community subs. Pocket

324
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:47,889
Polly coming in with 10. Holy shit. That's a lot of money. Well,

325
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:51,489
congratulations to the 10 people that got this massive amount of community

326
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:54,769
subs given away by Pocket Polly and others in Matters of Darkness as well.

327
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:06,179
That's a lot. Thank you, dude. So what is the... Is there any criteria to get

328
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:12,829
the random sub? Or is it just... You just get it randomly. Someone in the

329
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:21,579
chat does. It just happens. Damn. You just can't be subbed. Okay.

330
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:29,869
That's pretty cool. I didn't really know how it worked. You probably have

331
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:33,309
to be following. I mean, I don't have any settings set up like that if

332
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:38,510
they exist. Whatever they are, they're a default. But thank you, dude. Thanks

333
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:44,480
so much for your massive amount of subs that you've just gifted. So we got

334
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:55,440
this piece. I'm going to give 10 more. Hold on. What are you doing? Oh my

335
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:03,780
God. There's another 10. There it is. 10. That's 20 community subs from

336
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:11,150
Pocket Polly. Holy shit. I'm going to put this out of the way for now

337
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,230
because we've got another piece here that we need to work with. But damn

338
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:20,340
Pocket Polly. At the end of the day, thank you, man. Like, that's

339
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:30,719
that's a lot. Is it 26 now? Well, congratulations to the lucky

340
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:42,780
double dozen here. Oh, he bought the actual labo this time. I had the

341
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,820
other labos before. I just did... I did the pizza thing because it

342
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,980
worked. That'll be good. Well, there's a couple more little tabs.

343
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,099
You know what? I have one complaint about the labo. Can you pre-tab it?

344
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,579
Can you pre-punch tabs? I mean, I know it's a bit cheeky and oh no,

345
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:09,500
but it's fun to like punch out the little tabs. It just makes a mess.

346
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,900
I already got enough for cycling. Now I got to find all these little

347
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,659
bits and pieces. Oh my Lord.

348
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:34,190
Ragharnoi. Ragharnoi just gave out 10 community subs. 10 from

349
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:44,610
Ragharnoi. Thank you so much, dude. Oh dear. That's like 40 subs in.

350
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:49,010
That's like 50 subs almost in like fucking 10 minutes. I better make

351
00:51:49,010 --> 00:52:03,969
like a good stream. Jesus, man. Thank you. Thank you so much.

352
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:13,550
That's a lot of money and a lot of people. You guys are fucking awesome.

353
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,530
Thanks. Hopefully you're having a good time.

354
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,300
Let's head back into this. Then I'm already getting like greasy.

355
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,139
All right. Folds. All of them. I know they're everywhere.

356
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:31,150
All right. So fold everything. Oh my God.

357
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:38,989
Are you guys having a gift sub fight? That's 10 from Multi Trip.

358
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:50,380
Holy shit. I don't know what to do about this.

359
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,099
Like Rampaging Scrub, five. Multi Trip, 10.

360
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,610
Rampaging Scrub, five. Time for slime, five.

361
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,900
Five, five, five. This is madness.

362
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:10,670
Madness, darkness, another five.

363
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:24,050
Oh, whoa. All right. Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

364
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,570
That was just 20. I saw 20 from Kairatobi.

365
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:32,420
Kairatobi just gave 20 community subs. Madness, darkness just gave another five.

366
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:49,980
Oh, like dude, it's like drink. Okay. Thank you all for so much.

367
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:55,090
I thank you. I hope you think it's worth it.

368
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:58,289
That was like fucking almost 100 people.

369
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:21,059
InstaGator just gave out five. Thank you InstaGator for your five.

370
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:26,500
Kairatobi, 20. Thank you so much, everybody.

371
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:31,679
Such concludes the gifted sub portion.

372
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,980
It blows my mind all the time, guys. Like seriously.

373
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:59,090
That's five from Jamie. Jamie2803. Throwing the hat into the party here.

374
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,780
Five more from Jamie. Speech, speech.

375
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:13,199
I don't have a speech. I just hope that the next year that you watch

376
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,340
you think is worth the money. I hope the next month, the next 30 days you watch

377
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,699
you think is worth it because obviously it's every 30 days.

378
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:26,219
And if you don't think it's fun anymore after 30 days,

379
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,559
then you should not pay me money. You know what I mean?

380
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:42,480
I can't, I just can't believe that people, that's 10 from Visual Warlock.

381
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:50,820
Thank you for the 10 community subs. Thank you so much, dude.

382
00:55:51,619 --> 00:56:00,690
Thank you, all of you. 10 fucking subs, 5 subs, 20 subs, 10 subs, 10 subs.

383
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,199
That's a lot of money. I think sometimes it gets like lost.

384
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,769
You know what I mean? Like just how much of money that is to give to somebody.

385
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:11,730
Ramshackle gave out, giving out five here.

386
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,769
Thank you so much, dude. Thank you Ramshackle for your five community subs.

387
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,230
Thank you, everybody. Like I'm essentially speechless at the moment

388
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:34,639
because every time something like this happens, it's like, it's a weird feeling.

389
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:42,610
Another five from, from Vertibral Giant.

390
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
We're getting, this is, this is definitely over 100.

391
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,690
Am I doing this right? Am I doing the level correct?

392
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,260
I just saw somebody was angry because of this.

393
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:01,900
I'm sorry. I, I don't want you to be angry.

394
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,099
I want you to have fun.

395
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,940
You guys are fucking, this is like ridiculous.

396
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:17,900
Oh, the gifted subs are stalling.

397
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,420
Oh no. Oh my God.

398
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,960
Pocket Pauling just give a hundred dollars right now.

399
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,880
A hundred bucks. One hundred dollars.

400
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,920
You'll see it in a second.

401
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,639
There's so many subs coming through Streamlabs.

402
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:43,920
They can't even like keep up, I don't think.

403
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:46,380
Holy shit.

404
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,460
Well, Pocket Pauling, that's, you've, you've dumped at least two to plus three

405
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,659
hundred dollars right now.

406
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:57,860
Thank you for the hundred dollars here.

407
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,300
Hey, Jeremy, it was my birthday yesterday and I got cash.

408
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,699
So I thought I would be cash money of me to gift subs with the money I got.

409
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,380
Thank you for being a positive force.

410
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,380
And also thank you for drinking box wine on stream.

411
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,179
It's validation.

412
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:12,659
And, and I support you.

413
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:18,909
Cheers, man. Happy birthday.

414
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,159
I hope you had a good one.

415
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:29,860
I, I'm shocked and honored and I don't, I, every kind of emotion that you

416
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,780
would want to give me your blank birthday money, dude.

417
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,380
Like I, thank you.

418
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,599
I, I hope you had a good time.

419
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,360
I hope you were taken care of and I hope you took care of yourself.

420
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:43,280
Much love to you.

421
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,420
Because that's a lot of fucking money.

422
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:53,469
Um, and don't ever forget that because like I was about to say, it gets lost

423
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:58,030
sometimes like, oh, like 10 bucks, 20 bucks, like two dollars, one dollar,

424
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,869
one dollar, 20 bucks, a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks.

425
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:05,659
It gets lost in like a river and in a lot of cases.

426
00:59:05,659 --> 00:59:07,340
And I really don't want that to ever be the case.

427
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,280
So I hope you never feel that that's the case.

428
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:18,139
But it, you throw your money in a river.

429
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:20,699
No, I hope you know what I mean by that.

430
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,099
But happy fucking birthday to you, pocket polling.

431
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:28,130
I hope it was a great one.

432
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:42,050
But anyways, thank you for, thank you for just like giving me a guy on the internet.

433
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,889
Like right now, like four or $500 probably right there, whatever that was.

434
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,079
I will put it to good use.

435
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:48,559
I promise.

436
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:50,980
I promise.

437
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,230
So, uh, why, where were we here?

438
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:04,260
Going, we'll go into more box wine.

439
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,139
That's, that's correct.

440
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,260
So we've got all these pieces, all these things.

441
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:12,190
Everything needs to be folded.

442
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:12,670
I got those.

443
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,150
I got this.

444
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:13,869
I got this one.

445
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:18,110
So then where does this go in the grand scheme of things here?

446
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:18,750
Did I get that?

447
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,150
I did.

448
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,510
Hey, remove the five piece from sheet B.

449
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:25,710
So sheet B only has one more piece after this.

450
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,389
And it's the weird like toaster looking thing in the bottom right.

451
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,019
Celebratory dab.

452
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,860
Fine.

453
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:43,550
That initiated notes for a second.

454
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:59,949
The madman.

455
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,190
He's gone crazy.

456
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:05,329
Wow.

457
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,210
You stopped drinking.

458
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,170
What a lightweight.

459
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,530
I just filled it like not even 10 minutes, five minutes ago.

460
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:15,739
Do you know how many, how many glasses of wine are in this fucking box of wine?

461
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,099
29.

462
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:19,219
Oh, no, no, no.

463
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:22,420
That's 29 wine enthusiasts say this is their best buy award.

464
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,000
There's three liters in here.

465
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,780
Nintendo Davo.

466
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,610
Jesus.

467
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,139
All right.

468
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:37,340
Got these five pieces.

469
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,139
Flip it over.

470
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:42,510
Of course, rip all these little knobs out.

471
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:48,000
Compact liters.

472
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,760
Three liters.

473
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,239
Derma has a strong neck.

474
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,260
I don't, my neck always hurts.

475
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,059
Is that what that means?

476
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,829
The $400 dab.

477
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:07,550
Three liters is two glasses.

478
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,269
Three liters is like 20 glasses of wine.

479
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,389
Like at least 15.

480
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:13,760
So then this folds in half.

481
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,400
And then all these stick in the middle here.

482
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:16,719
Okay.

483
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:29,019
So pocketpalling just gave another $50.

484
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,280
Thank you for the $50 on top of all the other huge amount of money

485
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:37,920
that you've given today.

486
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,960
Pocketpalling.

487
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,440
50 bucks.

488
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,639
Thanks for the birthday wishes, everyone.

489
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,239
Also, Derma, please don't make yourself sick.

490
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:45,679
I'm drinking box wine right now, but that doesn't mean you should.

491
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,039
Sorry for giving more money.

492
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,179
Don't, you don't, don't apologize.

493
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:53,860
Just, I appreciate it.

494
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,340
I really do.

495
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:59,519
I hope you know that he's, he's drunk.

496
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:02,880
He's drunk and donating two things you never want to do.

497
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,840
Drunk and donate.

498
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:06,960
Oh my God.

499
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,119
People are like giving money now saying like, sorry.

500
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,809
Somebody stop him.

501
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,440
No.

502
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,900
That's okay.

503
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,860
Just I'm drinking.

504
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,139
We're drinking box wine together.

505
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:27,780
It's a box wine kind of day.

506
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,659
It's always a, this is like, guys, this is so cheap too.

507
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:32,980
You don't have to go buy the most expensive bullshit.

508
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,739
People go, but here, cheap doesn't mean bad.

509
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,969
You could go buy Fireball and that's bad, right?

510
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:41,090
We all agree on that.

511
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:47,250
But like a box of wine, it's like, this is like $17, but like six days worth of alcohol.

512
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:49,280
All right.

513
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,159
What do I do with these?

514
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,860
This is, this tastes good.

515
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,059
This is, this is, this is good.

516
01:03:57,699 --> 01:03:59,460
I'll give it a stamp.

517
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,619
Black box premium wines, the red blend.

518
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,659
That's, it's good.

519
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,800
If you, if they're watching right now, why would they be?

520
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,960
It's not like a, this is not a video game.

521
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,559
This is not like a game.

522
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,320
Oh, the dev is watching right now.

523
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,960
Why am I that much of a fucking ego maniac?

524
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,840
Like, oh yeah, you know, black box is probably watching right now.

525
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:18,639
What?

526
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,679
This is like 2,900, but there's like 50 trillion people on earth.

527
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:26,559
You think like the black box fucking wine smeller is watching this right now?

528
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,789
But yeah, red blends are always the best.

529
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:30,750
Always buy a red blend.

530
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,590
If you don't like red, you'll probably like a red blend.

531
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,519
Wait, what?

532
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:44,510
This is just a money stream for, okay.

533
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:58,159
First of all, Boston, Boston game gave $55 and 50 cents, $55.

534
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,500
They just say, sorry, don't say sorry.

535
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,059
Thank you.

536
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:04,739
Boston game for the huge amount of fucking money.

537
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:09,539
And then RT, RT game crowd came in with a hundred bucks.

538
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:15,139
Thank you.

539
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:21,550
RT game crowd, a hundred bucks just to make sure you don't recover emotionally.

540
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:24,429
But for real, thanks for the years of content, man.

541
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:28,349
You're my all time favorite creator and a massive influence on my own content

542
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:30,750
and wanting to drop a hundred on you for ages.

543
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,510
Go get yourself some more wine and cardboard.

544
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:39,900
Thank you, RT.

545
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,380
That's insane to hear that.

546
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,760
You're doing a great fucking job, dude.

547
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,320
Like, you really are.

548
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,750
Those of you that don't know who RT is, he's fucking killing it.

549
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,550
You're doing great, man.

550
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,159
I'm more than happy for you, for real.

551
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:05,230
But is Jerma okay?

552
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:05,869
I'm fine.

553
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,789
I'm like, I'm very happy right now.

554
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:10,590
How could I be not happy right now?

555
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:15,099
But thank you so much.

556
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,650
That's amazing to hear.

557
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:25,730
I just got like $700 in 25 minutes.

558
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,039
I'm kind of like, I don't really know what to do.

559
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:40,320
I hope you guys, look, I say it a lot, but this here, this,

560
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,900
no, this is, this is, this, this is number one.

561
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:48,579
Nothing else takes place of number one, except for my dog.

562
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:51,840
And like, I don't know, like my mother.

563
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,039
And like, I don't know, maybe like my girlfriends up there, like number one.

564
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,550
My health.

565
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,909
So maybe not number one.

566
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:09,070
You're probably like number like four, but you're like in the top five, right?

567
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,550
Under mom.

568
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,909
You guys are under mom, right?

569
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:11,710
That's a pretty big deal.

570
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:21,309
We're number four in the top five.

571
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:29,440
But all jokes aside, the only thing I care about with this stream

572
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,800
is making sure that people have fun.

573
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,639
And if you don't, then I hope you tell me.

574
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,099
Like right now, like I'm sure people are like,

575
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,340
this probably leads to a thousand people here that are going like,

576
01:07:39,219 --> 01:07:41,260
you're going to build the fucking thing, dude?

577
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,300
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, just wait.

578
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,179
I'm going, I'm trying.

579
01:07:44,429 --> 01:07:49,010
But for real, you guys mean a lot to me.

580
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,840
The stream does the whole thing does.

581
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,960
So I've never thought differently and I never will.

582
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,110
So, okay, much love to you.

583
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,489
Are you going to build that fucking thing, stupid?

584
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,389
It's hard.

585
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:06,590
It's cardboard for kids.

586
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,269
Boston game, Boston game, give another $50.

587
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,650
Sorry about the sorry, but in all seriousness,

588
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,130
I've enjoyed your content for years and this is the least I can do

589
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,210
to repay all the joy and entertainment you've given me.

590
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:24,579
I mean, what about my repayment to you?

591
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:26,579
You don't even like, look at where I am right now.

592
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,539
I moved to Las Vegas and I'm like working with a studio

593
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:33,899
and I'm going to be doing a bunch of shit on like,

594
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:37,020
who like, who made that happen?

595
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,500
You know what I mean?

596
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,539
Sure, I run the stream and like I make the stuff,

597
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:42,060
but if there weren't people here,

598
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,569
supporting the stream and giving the fucking money

599
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:46,850
and then if there weren't people here,

600
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,810
then I wouldn't be able to do it.

601
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:49,810
Don't forget that.

602
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:51,170
It's important.

603
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:59,310
But I've been on the same step for 40 minutes.

604
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:02,029
Well, but there were like some extenuating circumstances.

605
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:03,869
Like a thousand dollars came in

606
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,590
and I'm going to give it the attention that I believe it deserves.

607
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,470
So I'm sorry.

608
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:18,319
There's so many subscribers.

609
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,159
That subscription noise is going to happen

610
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,760
for like the next 20 or 30 straight minutes.

611
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,590
I created, I made this.

612
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,710
Oh my goodness.

613
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,630
That's, that's from, that, that's how many notifications,

614
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,670
pick up all the notifications.

615
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:37,760
That's from probably like 20 minutes ago

616
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,350
and five more subs from bet three.

617
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:50,079
Cheers everybody for real.

618
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:56,560
Smoke if you got them.

619
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,300
If you don't want that smoke, smoking is bad for you.

620
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,800
All right.

621
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,380
So these all need to go.

622
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:06,079
The, am I doing this the right way?

623
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,119
I think I am, right?

624
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,000
Because, right?

625
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,880
That's the correct way, right?

626
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,539
The piece is the wrong, wrong way.

627
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:42,079
That's not, well, you match it up with the, like, okay.

628
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:42,720
No, that's okay.

629
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,439
They were right there.

630
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:43,680
You're right.

631
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,000
You're right.

632
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,079
Right.

633
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:44,479
You're right.

634
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,800
You're right.

635
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,359
You're right.

636
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:45,859
You're right.

637
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,029
And when you're right, you're right.

638
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:56,380
You just are.

639
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,060
Why is he taking an hour to do this?

640
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,899
If you just jumped in or if you were here like an hour ago.

641
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:02,060
Okay.

642
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,619
So that's it.

643
01:11:02,619 --> 01:11:03,500
I got to, I got to explain.

644
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,060
But the people that, I should have just been staring at this.

645
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,659
Like, I don't understand how this, how does this work?

646
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:14,579
Like, all right.

647
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:17,779
Well, I started this and then there was, there was a lot of money came in.

648
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,460
So I, I had to stop for like a while.

649
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:21,939
I'm sorry.

650
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:24,350
I'm sorry.

651
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,670
Okay.

652
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,310
Check your work.

653
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,029
Work looks good.

654
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,869
Everything up on the side looks all right.

655
01:11:31,869 --> 01:11:32,430
You tell me.

656
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,270
That's bad.

657
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,149
That was a bad view.

658
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,699
Time to join up to the big fat guy.

659
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,760
Fold up this edge.

660
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,800
Maybe we're the right way.

661
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,920
No, we're not the right way.

662
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:45,729
So that goes up.

663
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:47,090
This goes through.

664
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:50,899
Streamer sucks.

665
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:55,100
Don't be so mean to me.

666
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:55,420
All right.

667
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,380
So then this part.

668
01:11:57,739 --> 01:12:03,340
I changed my mind.

669
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:06,300
Can I please have my $700 donation back, please?

670
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:10,020
All sales are final.

671
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:11,779
Whoa.

672
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:13,729
Whoa.

673
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:15,250
Hold on a second here.

674
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,939
There's RT's money.

675
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:33,180
Big money is getting to him.

676
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:35,420
No, I don't even want that to happen.

677
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,170
I need to continuously proud myself.

678
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:41,649
I can't.

679
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:42,850
I won't.

680
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,060
Okay.

681
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:45,939
There we go.

682
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:47,550
So that's not sitting still though.

683
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,319
Why is this not flat?

684
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,220
This is not flat.

685
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,020
Mine's not flat.

686
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,520
Why?

687
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:07,569
That's the Vegas gambling stream money.

688
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:10,479
This is freaking me out, man.

689
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,239
This like popsicle stand looking shit here.

690
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:12,399
Okay.

691
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:13,119
This goes up.

692
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,960
I want you guys to be able to see.

693
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,340
So that goes up like this.

694
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,350
Like that.

695
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:27,390
And then it folds all the way.

696
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:33,760
I never did this one.

697
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,199
Fuck, I never did this one.

698
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,739
There it is.

699
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:39,979
Okay.

700
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:40,300
Hold on.

701
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,180
I need to make sure that's tight.

702
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:43,020
Should I get the little flaps here?

703
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,369
Can you get a casino stream?

704
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:47,649
I would probably do something like that for fun,

705
01:13:47,649 --> 01:13:49,569
but you cannot film in a casino in Vegas.

706
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:51,970
You will get slapped in the face.

707
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,930
If you, if I was just sitting there like,

708
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,569
oh, hey guys, should I hit on black, I got blackjack.

709
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:00,140
It would be like, it would be bad.

710
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:04,859
Hold the side.

711
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:07,100
You rolled up with one hand like that.

712
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,220
Like an ice cream sandwich.

713
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:09,579
Flip this one up.

714
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,600
Use a hidden camera.

715
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:19,630
I'm not going to jail for our stream.

716
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:27,979
All right.

717
01:14:27,979 --> 01:14:29,100
Well, I need to pay attention.

718
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:29,739
This comes up.

719
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,890
Do it for views.

720
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:37,140
Look at that.

721
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,340
This is going to sound so nice.

722
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:46,369
That goes in there, right?

723
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:46,770
Come on.

724
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:47,409
Tell me it does.

725
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:48,050
I know it does.

726
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,090
I've seen this movie.

727
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:52,539
For content.

728
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,369
That's not a hidden camera in a casino is not.

729
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:01,310
How is that like content?

730
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:05,100
Just go watch cops.

731
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:10,449
You'll see the same material from the side.

732
01:15:10,449 --> 01:15:11,409
All the taps come up.

733
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:13,659
I don't think I folded these yet.

734
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:18,930
Build a labo in the casino.

735
01:15:19,569 --> 01:15:22,300
I'll tell you what I was actually going to do.

736
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,180
What I thought would be funny.

737
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:25,979
I'm sorry that I'm going to spoil this

738
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,739
because it was a really, really good idea.

739
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:31,260
I was going to, there are a lot of mountains around here.

740
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,739
There's like two that way.

741
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:35,659
There's like three that way.

742
01:15:35,659 --> 01:15:37,579
Vegas is surrounded by mountains.

743
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,020
And I thought it would be funny.

744
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:39,899
This is not going to spoil it.

745
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:40,300
Don't worry.

746
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:42,460
I thought it'd be funny if I built the labo

747
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,699
like on the top of like the summit of one of the mountains.

748
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:51,569
Like, oh, we're doing a labo today.

749
01:15:51,569 --> 01:15:51,970
Labo.

750
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,409
And then it's just me like wind gusting

751
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:55,250
and like trying to build a labo on the summit of a mountain.

752
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:02,779
Like Las Vegas just has so many mountains everywhere.

753
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,800
So in every direction do it.

754
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,479
I there wasn't enough time.

755
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,079
I'd have to like, that's a huge project.

756
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:15,920
Way more than I think anybody realizes.

757
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,300
I don't think I would even be able to have internet up there.

758
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,100
That was a huge problem with the hot air balloon stuff too is

759
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,579
you just don't fucking have internet.

760
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,180
Like it's just not possible to like get it

761
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,659
actually like the way that I really,

762
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:31,859
really, really would want it to happen.

763
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,720
Try to climb Everest so you can build a labo.

764
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,020
Please come in.

765
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:46,130
Oh, oh no.

766
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:46,369
Okay.

767
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:47,970
Is that supposed to happen?

768
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,630
It is.

769
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,289
Just use a really long cable.

770
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,409
This is why people give you money.

771
01:16:59,409 --> 01:17:01,489
Well, it's kind of, it's a cycle that

772
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:05,010
you know, I use the money.

773
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:08,369
So if somebody, like for instance, this money right here,

774
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:09,810
this is probably going to go directly.

775
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:13,010
Oh, the way that I get paid from Twitch

776
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:18,130
is like every month I want to like,

777
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,930
you know, do something that something different

778
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:24,369
or that costs money or that's where the money goes.

779
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:26,289
If you're curious as to where like,

780
01:17:26,289 --> 01:17:28,050
oh, where do I, where does my sub money go?

781
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,409
Where does my like bit money go?

782
01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:32,770
I mean, I'm going in front of a green screen in like five days

783
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,010
and I have a shitload of props

784
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:37,010
and we're doing like a whole green screen community event.

785
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,970
That's kind of like, that's kind of where it goes.

786
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,289
Every like 30 to 45 days I try to

787
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:46,770
think of something to do, you know,

788
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,369
and why can I not do this?

789
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,079
Am I doing this wrong?

790
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:01,819
This comes up.

791
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:02,300
Okay.

792
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,819
I was like, what the fuck am I doing wrong?

793
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:18,350
There we go.

794
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,989
Yeah, now look, I'll be completely and totally

795
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,590
see-through about this and I'll be transparent about it.

796
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,750
Of course, the money also goes to me living out here

797
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,350
and me living and expenses and eating and food and groceries

798
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:36,510
like, but a huge amount of it goes to the fuck

799
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:41,600
right to this room, right to immediately back

800
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:50,850
because I always told myself years ago

801
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,369
if I was ever in a position to be able to

802
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,529
do something like this,

803
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,689
but I was going to try to do it, right?

804
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:58,210
And I wanted to do the things that I wanted to do.

805
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,909
What the fuck is in there?

806
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,140
Can you see that?

807
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:08,750
Oh, you can.

808
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:08,989
Okay.

809
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:20,659
So it's this these come up because it okay.

810
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:27,760
So that folds in and that one goes in like that, right?

811
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,239
So wasp in your labo.

812
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,380
Put it out.

813
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:35,779
Put it out.

814
01:19:35,779 --> 01:19:36,100
Put it in.

815
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:36,579
Put it out.

816
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,369
Show finances on stream.

817
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:45,100
Let me get a refill.

818
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,720
If you want, if you want like money information,

819
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,239
the green screen stream will probably be about

820
01:19:51,760 --> 01:20:00,109
in total probably 1200 bucks to just to get it done.

821
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:08,050
And that's that's really reasonable considering all

822
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:08,930
the shit that I'm going to be doing.

823
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:23,779
I'm going to stop donating.

824
01:20:23,779 --> 01:20:25,380
He's getting too powerful.

825
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,699
Was that a hundred bucks?

826
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:33,649
Add that to the green screen list.

827
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:34,449
By the way, I have to do that.

828
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,949
Pocket Pauling given to the hundred dollars.

829
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,319
Thank you, dude.

830
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,979
Jeremy, did you know I'm running out of things to say to be honest.

831
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:53,579
Thank you for being my favorite YouTuber

832
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:55,180
and you deserve every single cent.

833
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:56,779
You deserve the world.

834
01:20:56,779 --> 01:20:59,180
Also shout out to blue 2018

835
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,060
and also my pronouns are they and them

836
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,899
for future reference, transgender pride.

837
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:05,729
Absolutely.

838
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,979
Thank you so much.

839
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:08,619
Pocket Pauling.

840
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:12,460
I don't know.

841
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,500
I don't think I deserve the world.

842
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,060
I really don't.

843
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,939
I just try to do my best,

844
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:19,260
which I think is something that

845
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:21,659
that's all I care about.

846
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:22,619
I just want to do my best.

847
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:24,300
And if my best is good enough, then it is.

848
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,180
If it isn't, then it's not.

849
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:30,779
But for the future, I will keep that in mind for sure.

850
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:38,720
And yeah, you give it a fucking shitload of money.

851
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:41,810
I don't want to take over the world.

852
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:43,409
I wouldn't want that.

853
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:47,010
I feel like I don't think it would.

854
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:47,890
I don't think it would go well.

855
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,329
I would replace every M&M.

856
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,250
You know, that'd be the first thing I would do.

857
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,409
Oh, what's the first order of business?

858
01:21:55,409 --> 01:21:56,770
Oh, well, you know, we got health care.

859
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,850
We've got, we've got like taxes.

860
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,529
No, I'm going to replace every M&M,

861
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:02,369
which is with with green M&Ms.

862
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,319
That's it.

863
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:04,880
I like that.

864
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,159
That's gonna take a long fucking time.

865
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,039
It's gonna take a lot of work.

866
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,640
A lot of work.

867
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:14,220
All right.

868
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,100
What piece am I on?

869
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,680
Why would you do the green M&Ms?

870
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,079
Because those have the best candy coating flavor.

871
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,399
That's it.

872
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:32,899
Done.

873
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,460
I'm done.

874
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,609
I did it.

875
01:22:36,609 --> 01:22:38,289
Why am I trying to yell to him?

876
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:38,789
All right.

877
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:40,689
First flip the...

878
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:41,409
We got two now.

879
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:43,760
One, two.

880
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:47,170
Yeah.

881
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,609
Jerma, everything you know is a lie with that attitude.

882
01:22:51,329 --> 01:22:57,920
Now we have to lick it shut.

883
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,880
It's like an envelope.

884
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,170
Which piece is this one?

885
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:15,550
This one.

886
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:16,590
So wait a minute.

887
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:17,630
Shut up, Nintendo.

888
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:26,829
Oh, stomp on it.

889
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:27,390
I'm not gonna...

890
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,829
Why would I stomp on this?

891
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,890
I can't fuck this place up.

892
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:32,390
Okay.

893
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,689
So then this now...

894
01:23:36,689 --> 01:23:38,289
Now lay the base on top of the pedal.

895
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:39,649
I'm sure it can handle the weight.

896
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:56,930
Okay.

897
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,949
Roll the whole thing over on its side.

898
01:24:03,949 --> 01:24:05,869
That bottom flap should tuck neatly under.

899
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,220
I am going to break this.

900
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,100
It probably will happen.

901
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,819
So roll on its side.

902
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:16,000
Like that.

903
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,260
I don't know what...

904
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,380
It wasn't the absolute heck fire.

905
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,100
Do you want me to do here?

906
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,340
Lock the pedal and base together.

907
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:29,229
So this folds down that.

908
01:24:30,619 --> 01:24:37,359
And then this goes in like that.

909
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:48,609
Okay.

910
01:24:48,609 --> 01:24:56,300
So they're right.

911
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,100
Am I doing that right?

912
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:57,659
Is that correct?

913
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,119
Yeah.

914
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:03,840
Oh yeah.

915
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,319
That's right.

916
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:08,670
Everything looks nice and secure.

917
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,750
Make sure it matches on what's on screen.

918
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:11,250
It does.

919
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:15,579
Flip it over.

920
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:21,789
That one goes down and this one goes...

921
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:22,289
Oh!

922
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:26,699
Uh-oh.

923
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:27,659
Is it lined up correct?

924
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:28,619
It might not be lined up right.

925
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:30,470
Yeah, it is.

926
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:40,640
That's in.

927
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,600
That's in.

928
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,239
Looks nice, secure.

929
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,600
I hope it matches what's on screen.

930
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,100
It does.

931
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,239
It does, Nintendo.

932
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,340
Turn the whole thing over so you get the eyes.

933
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,140
And this is the part.

934
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,100
I didn't fold this part.

935
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:54,640
Yeah, it did.

936
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,510
Down, in, in, up, secure.

937
01:25:58,510 --> 01:25:59,069
You got it.

938
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,430
Up, in, in.

939
01:26:13,229 --> 01:26:14,319
Pedal is done.

940
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:15,680
Done.

941
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,180
Here it is.

942
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:22,319
Hey, am I making a shoe box?

943
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:23,279
No, this is a...

944
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:24,159
This is a...

945
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:32,800
I was gonna say United States Postal Service pedal.

946
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,300
What?

947
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,000
Okay.

948
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,460
Final check.

949
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,420
Get everything in the right place.

950
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:39,659
Pedal is getting tired of supporting the base,

951
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:40,859
so let's flip them right way up.

952
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:44,850
That's it.

953
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:45,729
All that for this.

954
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:48,189
And that's our base and pedal all joined up.

955
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:49,789
Here's to a long and happy relationship.

956
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,899
Now we're gonna need some rubber bands.

957
01:26:53,899 --> 01:26:54,300
Okay.

958
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,460
There are two types to make sure you got the big ones.

959
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:02,020
Okay.

960
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,359
Crack it open.

961
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,939
That was the slowest pedal.

962
01:27:05,939 --> 01:27:06,439
I'm...

963
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:07,779
I'm sorry.

964
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:10,500
It's been an hour and 25 minutes.

965
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,100
I gotta...

966
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,220
Come on, we're gonna get snappy here.

967
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:13,720
Don't worry.

968
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:16,079
Where are the big ones?

969
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:16,640
There's only a few.

970
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,279
How many do I need?

971
01:27:19,890 --> 01:27:21,729
Oh, there are worms in here!

972
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:22,229
Oh!

973
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:24,609
That's not funny.

974
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:25,090
Don't do that.

975
01:27:25,649 --> 01:27:30,689
I mean, there are three big ones?

976
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,210
There's only three big ones.

977
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,250
Hopefully they gave me enough.

978
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,210
Do I have a defect?

979
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:42,930
Fucking defect, Nintendo?

980
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:47,159
All right, so we got three.

981
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:50,199
First, flip the whole pedal wide open.

982
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:51,159
Wow, so flexible.

983
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,680
Whoa, easy there.

984
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:54,760
Can mine do that?

985
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,380
What if mine can't do that?

986
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:03,920
I can't go that far.

987
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:04,420
Ah!

988
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:05,930
Ow!

989
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:07,970
I can't go the...

990
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:08,470
Ah!

991
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:09,510
It hurts.

992
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:11,750
I have 50 more dollars.

993
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,260
Ugh!

994
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,949
I can't believe these people

995
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:19,989
are still giving me this much money.

996
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:21,029
You guys are fucking incredible.

997
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,210
DivUSP gave 52 dollars.

998
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:27,090
Hey, Jerma, since this is basically a money stream...

999
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:31,939
I just want to donate, like, fuck it.

1000
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:32,439
LOL.

1001
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:34,020
But seriously though,

1002
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,140
wanted to thank you for everything.

1003
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,979
These past few months have been really bad.

1004
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,819
Just depressing, stressful, and painful as hell.

1005
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,279
But as of recent,

1006
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:41,399
things have been getting slightly better.

1007
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,640
Finally getting a job, building opportunities.

1008
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:46,199
And even though I don't want to get my hopes up,

1009
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:47,960
I feel like things are slowly improving.

1010
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,039
I want to say thanks since your stream helped me out a lot.

1011
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,850
First of all, I'm ecstatic

1012
01:28:56,850 --> 01:29:00,199
that you're starting to see some opportunities

1013
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:01,960
and that things are starting to look up a little bit here.

1014
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,960
I'm shocked every day, man,

1015
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,460
that people...

1016
01:29:11,539 --> 01:29:13,460
I can help you, honestly.

1017
01:29:14,609 --> 01:29:18,739
I'm more than humbled and more than happy to do it.

1018
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,060
I really hope you do well.

1019
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:25,460
As a 33-year-old man, let me tell you,

1020
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,699
it takes a long time.

1021
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:28,739
It takes more than you think.

1022
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,710
I remember 10 years ago,

1023
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:32,869
when I was in my early 20s,

1024
01:29:32,869 --> 01:29:34,470
I was like, holy shit, what's happening?

1025
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,270
What am I doing?

1026
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,149
What do I have to do with my life?

1027
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:36,710
What am I doing?

1028
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,750
I need to get a job, right?

1029
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:38,869
I'm just in a college.

1030
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:40,710
I had a fucking illness, right?

1031
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:42,920
And you figure it out.

1032
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,199
You just, you kind of do.

1033
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,560
But thank you so much.

1034
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,130
I hope you're on the right path.

1035
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:54,130
I hope you are on the path that you want to be on, right?

1036
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:57,779
Take care of yourself.

1037
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,039
You're the most important person in the world,

1038
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,000
especially up here.

1039
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,930
So take care.

1040
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,369
Thank you so much for even being here, man.

1041
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:10,069
That's advice that I needed.

1042
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:12,550
It's advice that I needed, too.

1043
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:16,659
When I was 25, 26, 24,

1044
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:20,869
as somebody that's, you know, a little older,

1045
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:23,350
you kind of figure it out.

1046
01:30:23,989 --> 01:30:31,539
It took me like seven years straight.

1047
01:30:32,819 --> 01:30:38,069
I'm just like skipping the movie here.

1048
01:30:38,069 --> 01:30:38,710
Okay, hold on.

1049
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:40,069
But thank you so much, dude.

1050
01:30:40,069 --> 01:30:41,270
I wish you the best, for real.

1051
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:43,989
You don't look 33.

1052
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:45,670
That's great, because when I'm 40, I'll look 30.

1053
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:47,520
But I'm losing my hair,

1054
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,359
so that's another problem entirely.

1055
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:51,359
All right, so we're going to do our stretch here.

1056
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:53,699
So those of you guys that stretch,

1057
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:54,500
how far can you go?

1058
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,460
I can't, like, this is my,

1059
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:56,100
I'm lying on my back,

1060
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,300
and these are my legs straight in the air.

1061
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,180
So like, I can't do this.

1062
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,359
Like, that hurts, right?

1063
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,960
I could do that, but like, this hurts a lot.

1064
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,359
Okay, so where's the rubber band?

1065
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:13,810
This goes through here,

1066
01:31:14,529 --> 01:31:18,720
through the little rubber band slots.

1067
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,079
I'm assuming that's what those are.

1068
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:20,880
Make sure it's perfect.

1069
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,680
Make sure it's perfect.

1070
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:27,189
I tried stretching and accidentally broke my mother's neck.

1071
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:31,029
Be more, be careful.

1072
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:31,529
What?

1073
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:35,859
That goes in there?

1074
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,029
Am I wearing a toupee?

1075
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:44,789
No, it's real!

1076
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:47,430
Not a toupee.

1077
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:50,630
I actually, I had a huge confidence boost.

1078
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:51,590
Wait a minute.

1079
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,869
I had a huge confidence boost.

1080
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:54,069
I want to get my hair cut, right?

1081
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,670
So I got a haircut,

1082
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:56,550
those of you that didn't notice.

1083
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,390
Didn't even notice my haircut.

1084
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:00,789
So, in the haircut place,

1085
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,470
as I'm getting my haircut,

1086
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:06,079
haircut lady says to me,

1087
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:07,520
to my face into the mirror, right?

1088
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,159
Because I'm looking in the mirror,

1089
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:09,039
looking at her face through the mirror,

1090
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:09,920
she's looking at me through the mirror.

1091
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,560
Wow, you have really nice hair.

1092
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,199
How old are you?

1093
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,800
What'd you say?

1094
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,029
33.

1095
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:20,840
It was great.

1096
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:26,689
And then I walked out of there like,

1097
01:32:27,729 --> 01:32:29,409
like I was a fucking maniac,

1098
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:29,890
you know what I mean?

1099
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:30,609
On top of the world.

1100
01:32:31,409 --> 01:32:33,439
My mouse is not there.

1101
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:35,039
Those of you guys that caught that,

1102
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:35,680
I'm sorry.

1103
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,199
And now my mouse doesn't do this.

1104
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:37,680
This does.

1105
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,760
All right, lift the pedal all the way up.

1106
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,079
The rubber band's not twisted.

1107
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,520
No, that looks fine, right?

1108
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:53,760
It's perfect.

1109
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:57,359
Now let's close the pedal back down.

1110
01:32:57,359 --> 01:32:58,079
That's much better.

1111
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,600
The pedal and base are complete.

1112
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:03,890
Time check!

1113
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:05,939
60 to 90 minutes?

1114
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:10,800
It's been, it's been 90 minutes.

1115
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,359
They say that to everybody.

1116
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:15,319
They're like, don't know what they say.

1117
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,479
I mean, I gave her a good tip.

1118
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:20,079
Is that what she was,

1119
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:20,880
is she wanted the tip?

1120
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:22,159
Did I get like,

1121
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,520
did I get like tip scammed?

1122
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:30,899
No, I was like,

1123
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:34,640
hold on, how much you want?

1124
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,439
Hey, take that.

1125
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:41,189
Whatever.

1126
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:43,189
She still said it.

1127
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:44,470
So part three, this needs to get,

1128
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,109
we make the frame.

1129
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:46,069
Let's get this out of the way.

1130
01:33:46,949 --> 01:33:47,840
We need D.

1131
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,840
This can move as well.

1132
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,479
We need D.

1133
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:56,340
D!

1134
01:33:56,899 --> 01:34:07,840
Oh, it smells like gasoline.

1135
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:11,810
Why?

1136
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:16,579
Oh my God.

1137
01:34:17,539 --> 01:34:21,840
Pocket Pauling.

1138
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:28,020
Jess gave another $50.

1139
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:39,359
Pocket Pauling says,

1140
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,840
if there's one thing I actually want from you,

1141
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,119
from my B day actually,

1142
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,720
it'd be for you to tell us one thing.

1143
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,640
Just say this one thing.

1144
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:47,520
It's very important.

1145
01:34:48,159 --> 01:35:05,760
He's a no life nerd who's never gotten something,

1146
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,000
a cat before in their,

1147
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:14,449
a cat before in their entire life.

1148
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:27,460
The full, okay.

1149
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:28,500
What is a cat?

1150
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,619
Cat is a cat.

1151
01:35:29,619 --> 01:35:29,939
Okay.

1152
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:31,380
Cat.

1153
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,939
What is a thesaurus for a cat?

1154
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,199
Kitten.

1155
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,079
Cat.

1156
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:42,739
Feline.

1157
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,239
Garfield.

1158
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:53,170
Pussycat.

1159
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:03,590
Ding ding.

1160
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:06,760
Said it.

1161
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,659
Wiser words have never been spoken before or since.

1162
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,930
No, I'm sure they have.

1163
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,279
Just edit it.

1164
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:19,840
Just do the fucking sentence mixing.

1165
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:23,000
Try to run from my past.

1166
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,289
He's socially awkward.

1167
01:36:36,289 --> 01:36:37,569
I am not socially awkward.

1168
01:36:37,569 --> 01:36:38,449
You ever meet me in public?

1169
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,710
Hey, fine.

1170
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:41,989
You want to talk socially awkward?

1171
01:36:41,989 --> 01:36:42,710
Those are your eyes.

1172
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:47,880
Like walking down the street here.

1173
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,359
Danny.

1174
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:49,560
Danny, what's up, man?

1175
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,600
Danny, how you been?

1176
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,800
It's good to see you again.

1177
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,840
Are you, yeah, both shake your hand for sure.

1178
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,039
I got a good grip like you do.

1179
01:36:56,039 --> 01:36:56,840
We both have good grips.

1180
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,199
Both not socially awkward at all.

1181
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,359
So you still at the printing company?

1182
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:04,100
Nice, dude.

1183
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,420
Nice.

1184
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:04,659
Awesome.

1185
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:05,060
Awesome.

1186
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:06,819
Me, no.

1187
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:09,699
I do online media.

1188
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:17,670
It's like a thing where you, it's online presence.

1189
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:18,630
An online presence.

1190
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,029
Online.

1191
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:21,489
How's the printing company going?

1192
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:24,180
See?

1193
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,739
That's how every conversation I have with people goes.

1194
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:28,020
Not socially awkward at all.

1195
01:37:38,069 --> 01:37:38,789
Nice job.

1196
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:42,289
But pocket polling, thank you so much.

1197
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:48,369
You've gone above and beyond at this point monetarily.

1198
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,560
I took them both out and I wasn't supposed to.

1199
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,439
I fucked it up.

1200
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:52,760
Whatever.

1201
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,239
We'll save it.

1202
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:54,920
Just need these two.

1203
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,020
You missed my donation?

1204
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,960
Those of you that are, almost hit the mic.

1205
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,800
That was the right one, right?

1206
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,680
Yeah.

1207
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,920
Those of you that are somewhat new to the channel potentially,

1208
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,159
I don't read anything really during the stream unless it's,

1209
01:38:16,789 --> 01:38:19,590
obviously, if it's $50, like 20 subs.

1210
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:23,829
Those are, they're huge amounts that I want to obviously address immediately.

1211
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:28,390
But we do a hangout after the stream where I go over all the bits,

1212
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:29,590
all the bit messages and everything.

1213
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:31,989
So I just don't do it during the stream.

1214
01:38:32,869 --> 01:38:34,789
He only reads huge donations.

1215
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:38,960
It's not untrue.

1216
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,359
So I can't be like, no, it's not untrue.

1217
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:47,729
Fix the Discord integration.

1218
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:50,159
Well, I'm a moron.

1219
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,600
So, but I haven't done that yet.

1220
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,069
I will someday.

1221
01:38:55,489 --> 01:38:57,010
All right, I'm ready.

1222
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:59,329
This goes like this, like this.

1223
01:38:59,329 --> 01:39:00,050
Good.

1224
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:05,750
Let's fold it all up.

1225
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:06,630
I know how to do that.

1226
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:10,390
You guys can still, you might need to turn the brightness up a little bit here

1227
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:12,069
just because it is getting a little dark.

1228
01:39:12,069 --> 01:39:15,890
It is 440.

1229
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:19,510
It's, why is time, I'm time traveling right now.

1230
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:26,850
Oh, what happened to Lego Island?

1231
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,930
Okay, so let me explain this while I have them in it here.

1232
01:39:36,069 --> 01:39:37,989
So everyone wants me to play Lego Island.

1233
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:57,460
And I bought some, I got a raspberry pea.

1234
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:04,609
I got a raspberry pea.

1235
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:09,680
I was going to do a thing where I built a raspberry pea computer

1236
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,680
and install Lego Island on it and play.

1237
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,640
And that was going to be the shtick.

1238
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,000
Make sure you do your research before you buy anything.

1239
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,600
This is, it can't run Windows on here.

1240
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,319
You can't install it.

1241
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:18,960
You have to go through.

1242
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,850
And there he goes.

1243
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,930
You can't install Windows on your pea.

1244
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:32,039
So now I just have a pea.

1245
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,220
What am I supposed to do with my pea pea now?

1246
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,359
That I don't know.

1247
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:43,760
Somebody wanted me to prove it and it was there.

1248
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,800
I can run Linux, but Lego Island does not run on Linux.

1249
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:49,600
It runs on Windows.

1250
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:53,199
So I would have to get Linux installed on my pea.

1251
01:40:54,159 --> 01:41:00,079
And then install a virtual machine on Linux for Windows 98 on the pea.

1252
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:03,520
Which is already slow enough.

1253
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,239
It would be like 0.02 frames a second.

1254
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:12,079
But that does not mean that I will not use that for something.

1255
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:14,560
I'm going to build a dumb computer at some point.

1256
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,600
I have all the peripherals.

1257
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,159
I'm going to build a fucking computer with that thing.

1258
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:19,359
And we're going to do something with it.

1259
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:20,159
I don't know what we're going to do.

1260
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,239
He's saying it wrong.

1261
01:41:23,239 --> 01:41:24,039
I'm sorry.

1262
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:28,119
Oh, italics told me last night to make sure I didn't say pea.

1263
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,220
I said it.

1264
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:34,100
All right.

1265
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:39,720
Let's fold the Raspberry Pi.

1266
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,039
Whatever.

1267
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,600
I can't even fucking run Lego Island.

1268
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,159
What's it worth?

1269
01:41:46,880 --> 01:42:09,760
But it actually came with a, so the original original plan was

1270
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,220
that's like a Google voice recognition box.

1271
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,539
And I was going to make that on stream.

1272
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:18,020
We were going to make a robot that I could talk to on stream.

1273
01:42:18,819 --> 01:42:20,840
And it uses a Raspberry guy.

1274
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:23,439
And oh my God.

1275
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,000
It's a 100.

1276
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,960
The instructions are 100 steps long.

1277
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:35,199
There was no way I was going to, there was just no way.

1278
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,289
And it needed my IP address.

1279
01:42:40,289 --> 01:42:42,770
And like, I'm not going to show my IP address on stream.

1280
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:45,319
That's like a death sentence.

1281
01:42:47,569 --> 01:42:48,930
Oh, by the way, here's my IP.

1282
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:51,270
See ya.

1283
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:56,260
Like you needed to, it has to like link up to your internet and show it.

1284
01:42:56,819 --> 01:42:57,560
All right.

1285
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,279
So that's all folded.

1286
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:07,619
It's fine.

1287
01:43:07,619 --> 01:43:08,899
It needs an internal IP.

1288
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:09,939
Oh, that's yeah, that's fine.

1289
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:11,060
It would just connect to like a router.

1290
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:16,869
But I, I don't, I, we just got our internet fixed.

1291
01:43:19,409 --> 01:43:20,449
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1292
01:43:20,449 --> 01:43:21,329
You know what I'm saying?

1293
01:43:21,329 --> 01:43:21,569
All right.

1294
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:23,569
So make pizza, make pizza.

1295
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,520
Oh, I didn't do it.

1296
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,930
I thought it was in the slot.

1297
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:50,159
Oh, got it.

1298
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:58,000
What if somebody guessed your IP address?

1299
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,960
There's, I don't, that's not even like a fucking reality.

1300
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:11,619
That's like somebody trying to guess cryptocurrency wallets.

1301
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,180
I'll get it one day.

1302
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:18,880
Looks good.

1303
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:27,920
What is that?

1304
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:33,880
When is the poll for the green screen stream?

1305
01:44:34,979 --> 01:44:36,180
That is a great question.

1306
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:38,199
And you will get it.

1307
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,600
I will tell you at the end of the stream.

1308
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:44,119
I forgot to do it.

1309
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:54,229
What do I need?

1310
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:04,359
The big one.

1311
01:45:04,359 --> 01:45:05,319
There's only one, right?

1312
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:06,119
This is the only one.

1313
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:08,420
I guess.

1314
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:15,170
You guys can narrow it.

1315
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:17,409
I don't, what, just relax, man.

1316
01:45:17,409 --> 01:45:23,189
Like, come on, relax.

1317
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:24,069
There's no need for this.

1318
01:45:24,789 --> 01:45:25,270
All right.

1319
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:28,630
So now we're going to need the grip stickers from the bag.

1320
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,949
Their rough surface will help our pedal from sliding around.

1321
01:45:30,949 --> 01:45:31,449
Okay.

1322
01:45:32,069 --> 01:45:38,229
What is the purpose of the handles on the table serve?

1323
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:53,039
So a grip sticker.

1324
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:56,550
If you have trouble spotting the gas between the stickers,

1325
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:58,310
try gently bending them a bit.

1326
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,550
Okay.

1327
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,869
I do.

1328
01:45:58,869 --> 01:45:59,350
I see them.

1329
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:02,550
Kind of.

1330
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,989
We've got to get some brightness in here, I think.

1331
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:05,729
Not yet.

1332
01:46:06,449 --> 01:46:11,479
Relax.

1333
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:13,319
So how many would just do one strip?

1334
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:15,590
Let's take a look at where the sticker is going to go.

1335
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:16,710
It's going to go in the pizza.

1336
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:19,109
Just don't say food items.

1337
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:19,590
I'm hungry.

1338
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:23,890
So one, two there, and then one all the way in the back.

1339
01:46:24,449 --> 01:46:24,949
There.

1340
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:31,409
Move a long sticker from the sheet.

1341
01:46:31,409 --> 01:46:33,090
Careful you don't get it stuck on anything.

1342
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:37,750
Where does it go so I can prepare it?

1343
01:46:39,329 --> 01:46:42,529
One into the sticker there, and then it's going to wrap around

1344
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:47,319
all the way around and then there.

1345
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:48,850
You got it.

1346
01:46:51,569 --> 01:46:52,369
You got it, man.

1347
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:58,529
How'd you like that?

1348
01:46:59,409 --> 01:47:00,609
Oh, okay.

1349
01:47:00,609 --> 01:47:03,010
So let's go thumb side first.

1350
01:47:04,529 --> 01:47:05,250
Right here.

1351
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:17,560
Flip it around and then this goes along the edge.

1352
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:29,010
That, that, and like that.

1353
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:30,520
Sweet!

1354
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:31,800
Sweet!

1355
01:47:36,979 --> 01:47:40,020
Okay, big bits.

1356
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:45,189
We got, we did, we did have, we had $10 from a free iPod.

1357
01:47:45,989 --> 01:47:49,189
What the fuck do I do with my life?

1358
01:47:49,189 --> 01:47:49,909
I'm stuck.

1359
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,789
Boat.

1360
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:53,909
And hearing you say that figuring shit out takes time really helps.

1361
01:47:54,069 --> 01:47:55,829
With the anxiety that comes with those thoughts.

1362
01:47:57,029 --> 01:47:59,029
Wish I could join in on the big bits, but I'm broke,

1363
01:47:59,029 --> 01:48:01,350
so just take the rest of my bits that I have lying around.

1364
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:03,109
Thanks for making the best content.

1365
01:48:03,829 --> 01:48:06,289
Thanks to the free iPod, first of all, and the $10.

1366
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:13,010
Yeah, as somebody that did not even understand the position

1367
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:15,649
that I could even possibly be in,

1368
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:19,670
five to ten years ago, I was just up in the air.

1369
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:21,189
I just had no idea what was going on.

1370
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:24,359
I didn't know where I was or where I was going,

1371
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:26,439
and you just kind of figure something out.

1372
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:28,840
It just kind of happens.

1373
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:30,840
And it might be something you don't even know.

1374
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,039
If you, it's like, oh, I'm going to do this,

1375
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:33,159
and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this.

1376
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:34,920
That's probably not true.

1377
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,600
It might be something else entirely.

1378
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:40,609
So thank you so much for your iPod.

1379
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:45,000
How did I sustain myself before Twitch?

1380
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,039
I had all kinds of odd jobs.

1381
01:48:46,039 --> 01:48:47,159
I did videography.

1382
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:48,279
I was a substitute teacher.

1383
01:48:49,239 --> 01:48:53,380
I, it was mostly videography.

1384
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,180
I filmed weddings.

1385
01:48:54,979 --> 01:48:55,699
Just freelance.

1386
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:58,529
I did that for a long time.

1387
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:03,409
I did, I worked at, I was like an aide.

1388
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:05,409
I was a teacher's aide for a long time as well.

1389
01:49:06,289 --> 01:49:10,869
But subject, I didn't teach a certain subject.

1390
01:49:10,869 --> 01:49:13,670
I just was a substitute teacher for a school district, so.

1391
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:20,130
But you just kind of do whatever

1392
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,409
until you find out what you're going to do.

1393
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:25,010
And sometimes it is, it kind of comes out of left field.

1394
01:49:25,729 --> 01:49:34,899
I had to teach math once, right?

1395
01:49:35,539 --> 01:49:36,979
Yeah, I've had to teach math a couple of times,

1396
01:49:36,979 --> 01:49:39,060
and it was just, I had no idea what the fuck to do.

1397
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:40,340
It was bad.

1398
01:49:40,899 --> 01:49:45,399
And it always sucks because when you know that

1399
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:50,199
the students know way more than you, and it's very clear,

1400
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:53,560
it's just embarrassing.

1401
01:49:56,119 --> 01:49:57,720
It really is fucking embarrassing.

1402
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:02,000
I remember a kid shit himself in class.

1403
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:11,119
I, why would, no, first of all, I did not,

1404
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:18,550
I need to fold this like that.

1405
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:24,470
You teach freshman driver's ed and it's hell.

1406
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:27,479
I could probably teach driver's ed.

1407
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:30,659
I'm a very good real life driver.

1408
01:50:30,659 --> 01:50:36,180
This goes right in the middle, right?

1409
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:40,239
Like this, all the way through.

1410
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:44,100
It's a tight fit, but you can do it.

1411
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,460
And then all the way through.

1412
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:54,210
I feel like I'm in candlelight right now.

1413
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:59,270
One side and the other.

1414
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:00,949
There it is, nice and snug.

1415
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:03,250
Oh, I gotta pee.

1416
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:04,770
Don't go anywhere.

1417
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:05,729
Don't go anywhere, I gotta pee.

1418
01:51:06,449 --> 01:51:08,050
How do I turn the BRB screen on?

1419
01:51:08,689 --> 01:51:11,159
What the hell is that?

1420
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:15,350
Oh, that's the wine.

1421
01:51:17,729 --> 01:51:19,729
This is the wine, this is the wine spigot.

1422
01:51:20,449 --> 01:51:28,069
Hold on, hold on, I got it.

1423
01:51:28,069 --> 01:51:29,029
All right, be right back.

1424
01:53:11,479 --> 01:53:13,720
All right, be right back.

1425
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:27,649
I'm back.

1426
01:54:27,649 --> 01:54:41,399
It's like I never left.

1427
01:54:42,039 --> 01:54:43,859
Oh yeah, you think this is cool?

1428
01:54:43,859 --> 01:54:44,260
Watch this.

1429
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,850
This chair was way too expensive.

1430
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:49,489
It's not even good.

1431
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:51,649
All right, now it's time for the lock.

1432
01:54:51,649 --> 01:54:52,770
The left frame on the pedal base.

1433
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:54,130
Get over here, pedal base.

1434
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:54,449
What?

1435
01:54:55,010 --> 01:55:03,829
The ones of this over here now.

1436
01:55:03,829 --> 01:55:09,220
We spent three hours on the part that says it'll be one.

1437
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:14,149
Um, it's only been an hour and 55 minutes.

1438
01:55:14,949 --> 01:55:18,390
And about 30 of that was the huge amount of money that came in.

1439
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,189
30 minutes or so.

1440
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:22,149
So really only been about an hour and 30 minutes on this part.

1441
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:23,670
What are you getting three?

1442
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:25,109
What are you getting three?

1443
01:55:26,069 --> 01:55:34,340
Blame the donators.

1444
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:39,890
Turn up the volume.

1445
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,010
No, sure.

1446
01:55:42,609 --> 01:55:43,810
Don't listen to them.

1447
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:44,689
Do what you want to do.

1448
01:55:44,689 --> 01:55:45,569
But what if they leave?

1449
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,090
I don't fucking care.

1450
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:49,170
Do what you want to do.

1451
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:56,069
All right.

1452
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:58,920
So left is this one over here.

1453
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:06,720
Like this.

1454
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,130
What the fuck does it do this?

1455
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:13,460
Stand with the frame and base piece.

1456
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:14,500
So stand this up.

1457
01:56:18,579 --> 01:56:20,100
That's standing this way.

1458
01:56:20,819 --> 01:56:31,600
And then I got a tab here.

1459
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,880
So it's got to go like this.

1460
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,720
We need brightness.

1461
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:35,680
All right.

1462
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,800
I'm going to say, do I need brightness?

1463
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,279
And then I want everyone in the chat to say yes or no.

1464
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:40,319
Do I need brightness?

1465
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:46,550
Okay.

1466
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:53,300
That's all I needed to hear.

1467
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,199
Well, that's too much.

1468
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,220
That's fine.

1469
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:08,630
Make sure we don't get a little ghosting.

1470
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:09,109
You know what I mean?

1471
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:16,520
And turn the lights up probably a little bit higher.

1472
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:20,920
That's good, right?

1473
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:23,350
Not 15 FPS.

1474
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:24,310
I don't want to keep it like that.

1475
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,869
That looks fine.

1476
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:27,670
Let me do the other one here.

1477
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:33,939
This is what happens when you start streaming in the light

1478
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:35,300
and it turns into dark.

1479
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:42,149
Just kind of does this.

1480
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:49,920
It's not 60 FPS.

1481
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,920
I can't handle 60 FPS.

1482
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,399
You can't even see faster than the human eye 24.

1483
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:56,710
Let me break.

1484
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:57,680
All right.

1485
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:58,640
Where's the level?

1486
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,880
Right there.

1487
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:02,600
Okay.

1488
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:08,390
Nice shirt.

1489
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:09,270
Thanks, man.

1490
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:09,590
All right.

1491
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:11,029
So this goes in like that.

1492
01:58:11,029 --> 01:58:11,750
Stick it in.

1493
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:13,029
And then the tab closes.

1494
01:58:13,029 --> 01:58:14,390
So this has to go in like this.

1495
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:18,760
You can't see 4K.

1496
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:23,109
Then you can see 4K.

1497
01:58:23,989 --> 01:58:27,720
And you can't see 4K, but your TV can.

1498
01:58:29,079 --> 01:58:30,039
Ooh, that fell.

1499
01:58:30,039 --> 01:58:30,600
That went in.

1500
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:31,560
Hopefully that's the right way.

1501
01:58:35,409 --> 01:58:38,020
Yes.

1502
01:58:38,899 --> 01:58:45,159
Is that a Mani shirt?

1503
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:47,039
No.

1504
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:50,159
It's like a $12 bargain bin Nightwing shirt.

1505
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,840
That's it.

1506
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:00,720
And Rage Grandpa just gave $10.

1507
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,210
Thank you.

1508
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:04,689
No message.

1509
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:09,539
No, it's Nightwing.

1510
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:13,859
I was going to be Nightwing for Halloween this year,

1511
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:15,380
but I was too fat to be in the suit.

1512
01:59:15,939 --> 01:59:16,579
I looked ugly.

1513
01:59:16,579 --> 01:59:17,220
It looked shitty.

1514
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:19,060
It was like my stomach hung out and it didn't look good.

1515
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,340
And if you go out, if you're going to go out

1516
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:21,939
and you're going to wear like a Nightwing shirt

1517
01:59:21,939 --> 01:59:23,140
or you're going to be like Nightwing.

1518
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:26,020
Oh boy, you bet you got to, you can't just,

1519
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:27,220
you can't have like fat stomach.

1520
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:32,390
It was like, and like, wow, look at, I'm like,

1521
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:35,989
look at how sexy I can look in my fucking Nightwing spandex.

1522
01:59:35,989 --> 01:59:36,390
No way.

1523
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,159
Like if I shook my stomach, you'd hear fucking liquid.

1524
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:48,869
Nightwing was a loser.

1525
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:59,189
All right.

1526
01:59:59,189 --> 01:59:59,670
Whoa.

1527
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:00,550
Let's keep going here.

1528
02:00:01,189 --> 02:00:03,970
Oh, you read that one.

1529
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:05,489
Yep.

1530
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:05,890
I did.

1531
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:07,680
Yep.

1532
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:09,119
I read them all, guys.

1533
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:12,420
German, does German pay attention to chat?

1534
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,380
I read them all.

1535
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:23,140
All of them, all of them, all of them.

1536
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,180
That one, even this one, this one.

1537
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:24,979
Yep.

1538
02:00:24,979 --> 02:00:25,699
He won't read this.

1539
02:00:25,699 --> 02:00:26,180
Yes, he will.

1540
02:00:26,819 --> 02:00:29,649
All right, let's do the,

1541
02:00:29,649 --> 02:00:32,210
let's get this one hour and 60 minute piece done.

1542
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:32,930
Okay, there's this one.

1543
02:00:33,489 --> 02:00:34,289
I'm going to need another one.

1544
02:00:34,289 --> 02:00:35,569
Okay, I know this one.

1545
02:00:35,569 --> 02:00:36,210
I can do it quick.

1546
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:38,979
Let's move this out of the way.

1547
02:00:38,979 --> 02:00:39,779
We don't need it for now.

1548
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:45,159
Fold, fold, fold, fold.

1549
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:49,409
If you read this one, scream Inspector Gadget.

1550
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:50,130
I'm not going to scream.

1551
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:52,130
I just said Inspector Gadget, which proves that I read it.

1552
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:56,869
All right, the whole thing folds up.

1553
02:00:56,869 --> 02:00:58,310
Just fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.

1554
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,430
This is the other side of the pedal.

1555
02:01:00,149 --> 02:01:02,390
How am I going to get the camera set up so you can see everything?

1556
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:04,229
That's going to be weird, isn't it?

1557
02:01:05,029 --> 02:01:08,630
One hour and 50 minutes.

1558
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:09,510
Don't you mean two hours?

1559
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:14,630
No, two hours would be one hour and then 60 minutes go by and that's two hours.

1560
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:15,989
So it has not been two hours.

1561
02:01:15,989 --> 02:01:17,909
It's been one hour and 50 minutes.

1562
02:01:18,869 --> 02:01:20,550
Well, it's been two hours and two minutes.

1563
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:25,319
So that's wrong.

1564
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:31,600
You said 60.

1565
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,520
I know one hour and 60 minutes have to go by for an hour to be counted.

1566
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:40,399
Somebody said two hours, one hour and 50 minutes, but that's not it.

1567
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:41,760
There's an extra 10 minutes there, man.

1568
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,119
So an hour passed.

1569
02:01:46,119 --> 02:01:50,359
No, I'm making the point that somebody said that it had been two hours

1570
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:51,880
and it was an hour and 50 minutes.

1571
02:01:53,399 --> 02:02:06,920
One hour, 59 minutes, and 60 seconds.

1572
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,399
That's correct.

1573
02:02:08,199 --> 02:02:09,800
God, I'm glad somebody gets it.

1574
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:20,800
Eat the cardboard.

1575
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,289
I don't think I will.

1576
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:31,380
All right.

1577
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:35,619
So I always see you guys have to give me some info here.

1578
02:02:35,619 --> 02:02:38,819
I always see people say like, oh, eat that.

1579
02:02:38,819 --> 02:02:39,619
Eat cardboard.

1580
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:41,600
Eat Weibo.

1581
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:44,000
Chew on glass, right?

1582
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,239
Are there streamers that you go in their chat and you say like, oh, eat pants.

1583
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:49,039
And they're like, okay.

1584
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:52,100
And they just talk.

1585
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:52,979
Do they do that?

1586
02:02:52,979 --> 02:02:54,020
Is that like a thing?

1587
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:59,399
Do you guys convince people to eat shit they're not supposed to eat?

1588
02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:00,439
Is that like a Twitch thing?

1589
02:03:06,119 --> 02:03:07,560
Vinny did it one time.

1590
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:09,720
Oh, and Vinny ate his pants on stream.

1591
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:11,170
Did?

1592
02:03:11,729 --> 02:03:20,390
He did.

1593
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:23,909
Why?

1594
02:03:23,909 --> 02:03:24,710
Why did he do that?

1595
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:26,789
I need more context.

1596
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:30,470
Now I have to do it.

1597
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:31,270
Why would I?

1598
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,750
What?

1599
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:32,069
Why?

1600
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:34,229
I don't have to do it.

1601
02:03:34,229 --> 02:03:39,569
Is that?

1602
02:03:39,569 --> 02:03:39,810
Okay.

1603
02:03:39,810 --> 02:03:40,930
Make sure I did that right.

1604
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:41,170
Did.

1605
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:43,989
It was crazy.

1606
02:03:43,989 --> 02:03:44,949
He's a real mad man.

1607
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:55,029
Open your window and scream out of it.

1608
02:03:55,029 --> 02:03:55,750
Okay.

1609
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:58,279
I will.

1610
02:03:58,279 --> 02:04:06,819
I'm not going to.

1611
02:04:06,819 --> 02:04:07,300
I'm kidding.

1612
02:04:08,439 --> 02:04:09,479
Same thing with this.

1613
02:04:09,479 --> 02:04:10,119
Goes right there.

1614
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:16,000
We're almost done with 5% of the whole labo.

1615
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,079
Are you guys prepared?

1616
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:20,899
Are you prepared?

1617
02:04:21,699 --> 02:04:37,460
Fix your posture.

1618
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:39,699
My posture is flawless.

1619
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:52,710
Okay.

1620
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:57,119
We're fine.

1621
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:57,520
Posture.

1622
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:57,760
Look.

1623
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,960
Anytime somebody says, oh, fix your posture.

1624
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,079
You guys just go like, okay.

1625
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:06,630
People don't sit like this.

1626
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:14,000
Lick the cardboard.

1627
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:14,560
I paid you.

1628
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:19,090
Like talk to bottom or like how do you want me to do it?

1629
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:25,479
Have I been gnomed today?

1630
02:05:25,479 --> 02:05:26,520
I haven't been gnomed in like a week.

1631
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:27,560
Two weeks.

1632
02:05:28,119 --> 02:05:29,479
All right.

1633
02:05:29,479 --> 02:05:30,039
We did this part.

1634
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:30,439
We're good.

1635
02:05:36,449 --> 02:05:37,970
Shave your beard on stream.

1636
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:38,529
I already did that.

1637
02:05:38,529 --> 02:05:41,039
I already showed my fucking skills.

1638
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,960
Where's that piece?

1639
02:05:57,779 --> 02:05:58,260
Read a book.

1640
02:05:58,899 --> 02:06:00,579
No, I'm playing the labo, man.

1641
02:06:00,579 --> 02:06:02,760
This is the only other time I'm ever going to get to do this.

1642
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,600
You guys, you realize that, right?

1643
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:05,880
This.

1644
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:07,319
Hey, look.

1645
02:06:07,319 --> 02:06:08,359
I'm playing labo.

1646
02:06:09,159 --> 02:06:09,800
Gotcha.

1647
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,159
Like I can't do this ever again.

1648
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:12,279
So just let me have this.

1649
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:19,729
What's it like getting the senior discount?

1650
02:06:19,729 --> 02:06:21,329
It's fucking awesome, actually.

1651
02:06:21,329 --> 02:06:23,810
You get like 20% off literally everywhere you go.

1652
02:06:24,529 --> 02:06:27,250
Well, what's it like saving money everywhere you go?

1653
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:27,970
That's great, man.

1654
02:06:27,970 --> 02:06:28,689
It's great.

1655
02:06:28,689 --> 02:06:29,810
We want to say it sucks.

1656
02:06:30,369 --> 02:06:31,409
Well, that sucks.

1657
02:06:31,409 --> 02:06:32,770
I hate saving money everywhere.

1658
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,680
Status quo on the green screen Thursday.

1659
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:45,439
It's locked in with the studio I'm working with.

1660
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:49,680
Thursday is the green screen stream Thursday afternoon Eastern time.

1661
02:06:58,239 --> 02:06:59,600
I'm going to get a haircut next week.

1662
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:01,439
If I want the same as yours, what should I tell her?

1663
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:05,520
Tell her you want the single piece swoop.

1664
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:11,600
And she'll have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

1665
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:20,039
So this goes in like that, right here.

1666
02:07:30,449 --> 02:07:32,449
The default Fortnite dance has to happen.

1667
02:07:32,449 --> 02:07:33,329
It's not negotiable.

1668
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:36,289
I'm not doing a Fortnite dance on a green screen.

1669
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,119
I will be dead in 100 years, right?

1670
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,199
Well, probably way sooner than that.

1671
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,680
But I don't want a keyable Fortnite dance

1672
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,039
that you can just anybody into.

1673
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:50,640
We're talking like 80 years in the future.

1674
02:07:51,199 --> 02:07:53,119
I don't want that to be available for anybody to have.

1675
02:07:54,229 --> 02:08:00,819
No, why would I want that to be available for anyone

1676
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:02,579
in like a thousand years?

1677
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,149
All right, here comes the next piece.

1678
02:08:07,489 --> 02:08:09,250
So this comes down here

1679
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,850
and we're going to do the same thing on this side

1680
02:08:11,569 --> 02:08:12,850
that we did on that one.

1681
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:18,020
Stick it in here, right?

1682
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:18,899
Wait, wait, wait.

1683
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:20,579
Blue or blue facing in?

1684
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:21,859
Nope, okay.

1685
02:08:21,859 --> 02:08:23,060
Yeah, I can't do that anyway.

1686
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:27,140
Shove it in.

1687
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:27,779
Shove it in there.

1688
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:29,119
You got it.

1689
02:08:32,449 --> 02:08:33,170
Hope it was right.

1690
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:41,939
Oh, I don't want to do it so bad

1691
02:08:41,939 --> 02:08:45,060
but people will cringe at me and shit.

1692
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:46,260
But that's the point.

1693
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:02,130
Take me to your leader.

1694
02:09:02,689 --> 02:09:14,479
You know what's going to happen.

1695
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:15,199
Everyone's going to say it.

1696
02:09:15,199 --> 02:09:17,680
Everyone's going to go, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1697
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:21,060
I knew it was going to happen.

1698
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:21,619
You didn't even.

1699
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:27,359
Now it's all the only thing in the chat.

1700
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:28,880
It's the only thing there.

1701
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,640
It's the only thing in the chat right now.

1702
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:31,359
You did this.

1703
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:31,840
You did it.

1704
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:34,850
Looks good.

1705
02:09:41,489 --> 02:09:42,289
This got it.

1706
02:09:42,289 --> 02:09:43,250
This got sick, dude.

1707
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:47,170
All right.

1708
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:48,609
Your pedal's been standing up for straight.

1709
02:09:48,609 --> 02:09:50,130
Why don't you lay it on its back?

1710
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:53,680
This seems off.

1711
02:09:54,880 --> 02:10:00,609
Is it?

1712
02:10:00,609 --> 02:10:01,090
All right.

1713
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:02,130
If you need time to take a rest,

1714
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:04,689
now's my time to honka-chukka, honka-chukka.

1715
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:24,199
Like, at the spell out.

1716
02:10:24,199 --> 02:10:25,399
Look, let me show you.

1717
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:27,640
If somebody was snoring,

1718
02:10:28,359 --> 02:10:31,779
like, that's spelled out like this.

1719
02:10:40,369 --> 02:10:45,109
Like, I just said it as a word.

1720
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,739
That's my favorite Pokemon, too.

1721
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:07,560
Can't see the computer screen.

1722
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:10,000
It's right here.

1723
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,119
What are you talking about, man?

1724
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:11,840
What are you talking about?

1725
02:11:12,479 --> 02:11:13,159
All right.

1726
02:11:13,159 --> 02:11:13,720
Let's fold it up.

1727
02:11:14,439 --> 02:11:23,119
Fold the tip.

1728
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:24,079
I'm doing it.

1729
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:27,140
I'm really doing it.

1730
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,640
Okay.

1731
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:33,989
Fold the tip.

1732
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:35,350
I already did it.

1733
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:40,199
Get a wax figurine of myself.

1734
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:40,600
For what?

1735
02:11:41,479 --> 02:11:43,239
Yeah, that'll be like 25 grand.

1736
02:11:44,039 --> 02:11:54,319
You're folding it wrong.

1737
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,279
I'm not folding it wrong.

1738
02:11:58,079 --> 02:11:58,479
You are.

1739
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:00,529
No, you.

1740
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:07,460
I'm not folding it wrong.

1741
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:07,859
No, you.

1742
02:12:11,779 --> 02:12:18,359
All right.

1743
02:12:18,359 --> 02:12:19,159
That comes up.

1744
02:12:19,159 --> 02:12:19,960
Both of them come up.

1745
02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:30,369
This fold.

1746
02:12:30,369 --> 02:12:31,329
I got it the wrong way.

1747
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:34,560
This has to fold up.

1748
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:36,020
Fuck.

1749
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:37,840
Fuck.

1750
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,340
Okay.

1751
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,680
And this folds in.

1752
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:41,180
Fuck.

1753
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:43,489
Hold on.

1754
02:12:43,489 --> 02:12:44,369
I need this to be tighter.

1755
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,399
Fuck, dude.

1756
02:12:49,399 --> 02:12:50,119
Okay.

1757
02:12:50,119 --> 02:12:50,840
This comes in.

1758
02:12:53,539 --> 02:12:54,039
Fuck.

1759
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:04,680
Okay.

1760
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:05,560
It goes all the way around.

1761
02:13:06,199 --> 02:13:07,399
And then it closes down.

1762
02:13:07,399 --> 02:13:07,899
There.

1763
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:12,229
Folds down around and that sticks in there.

1764
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:14,069
What ingenuity.

1765
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:16,310
Same thing on this one.

1766
02:13:16,949 --> 02:13:17,430
Check it.

1767
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:18,069
Look at it.

1768
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:18,569
Check it.

1769
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:20,119
There you go.

1770
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:21,560
There's your fucking shitty park bench.

1771
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:25,619
Go easy on the wine.

1772
02:13:29,479 --> 02:13:30,039
We're good, man.

1773
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:31,970
I have.

1774
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:33,649
I'm having so much fun.

1775
02:13:33,649 --> 02:13:34,149
You know?

1776
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:43,010
That's it for that.

1777
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:45,649
Fold in the tip or refund all donations.

1778
02:13:45,649 --> 02:13:46,770
What are you talking about?

1779
02:13:47,649 --> 02:13:50,210
What are you talking about?

1780
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:51,920
It's perfect.

1781
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:53,750
What do you mean?

1782
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:55,760
The top.

1783
02:13:56,819 --> 02:13:57,619
Fold the top.

1784
02:13:58,340 --> 02:13:59,640
The top is folded.

1785
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:03,060
Fold the top.

1786
02:14:16,279 --> 02:14:17,000
That's not the top.

1787
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:17,640
That's an arm.

1788
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:21,909
Fold the left arm is what you should have been saying.

1789
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:23,909
Not fold the top.

1790
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:24,630
This is the top.

1791
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:25,989
That's the top.

1792
02:14:25,989 --> 02:14:27,109
This is the left arm.

1793
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:35,079
Somebody just read.

1794
02:14:37,649 --> 02:14:41,119
Really?

1795
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:43,039
I have way too much fun when I do this.

1796
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:43,520
I really do.

1797
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,079
I'm not even kidding.

1798
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:45,359
I'm having like a fucking great time.

1799
02:14:49,409 --> 02:14:51,010
This is like I love this.

1800
02:14:52,899 --> 02:14:53,460
Okay.

1801
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:55,699
So this goes like that.

1802
02:15:01,239 --> 02:15:04,979
This Nintendo Labo signature watermark goes down.

1803
02:15:05,619 --> 02:15:08,920
And that sticks in up here.

1804
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,720
Weird, though.

1805
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:10,119
Weird.

1806
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:14,880
Weird, though.

1807
02:15:15,439 --> 02:15:15,920
Like that?

1808
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:19,109
Strange.

1809
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:21,859
Interesting.

1810
02:15:21,859 --> 02:15:22,420
Weird, though.

1811
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:23,380
How?

1812
02:15:24,579 --> 02:15:25,619
Slide into the slots in the frame.

1813
02:15:25,619 --> 02:15:27,300
You can do it one side at a time.

1814
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:40,310
Okay.

1815
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:40,949
Boom.

1816
02:15:40,949 --> 02:15:46,050
All right.

1817
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:46,850
Earthquake test.

1818
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:49,750
That's good.

1819
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:56,840
We're good.

1820
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:03,670
I'm not going to break it.

1821
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:05,079
All right.

1822
02:16:05,079 --> 02:16:05,720
Logos down.

1823
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:09,989
Attach the bridge to our rubber band from before.

1824
02:16:09,989 --> 02:16:11,029
Turn the whole pedal around.

1825
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:20,020
Stretch the rubber band out.

1826
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:21,140
Hook it over the bridge.

1827
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:23,220
Now you're getting weird here.

1828
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:23,380
All right.

1829
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:25,939
So this has come up and then has to go through those slots.

1830
02:16:26,819 --> 02:16:28,149
Turn the pedal around.

1831
02:16:28,149 --> 02:16:28,949
So wait a minute.

1832
02:16:29,670 --> 02:16:36,629
One side.

1833
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:48,790
Get out.

1834
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:49,030
No.

1835
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,909
Now it's twisted off.

1836
02:16:50,549 --> 02:17:13,829
Turn the pedal around.

1837
02:17:13,829 --> 02:17:16,559
And can this take this?

1838
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:19,360
Stretch it out and around underneath.

1839
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:22,469
This just feels...

1840
02:17:22,469 --> 02:17:23,270
This feels taut.

1841
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,399
Ah, this is gonna break.

1842
02:17:41,969 --> 02:17:43,809
You'll control the toy compatible with your foot.

1843
02:17:43,809 --> 02:17:45,329
Try stepping on it to check how it feels.

1844
02:17:46,049 --> 02:17:57,090
Let's try it out.

1845
02:17:57,090 --> 02:18:02,850
That actually feels pretty good.

1846
02:18:07,809 --> 02:18:08,049
See?

1847
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:15,250
That works, right?

1848
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:21,190
I think it's done.

1849
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:28,879
That's...

1850
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:30,000
That's it, right?

1851
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,170
Do you feel the tension?

1852
02:18:33,170 --> 02:18:33,729
I do.

1853
02:18:33,729 --> 02:18:35,010
I do feel the tension.

1854
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:36,049
So we're good.

1855
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:39,120
What have I done?

1856
02:18:46,579 --> 02:18:48,159
Get out of here.

1857
02:18:48,159 --> 02:18:48,479
All right.

1858
02:18:48,479 --> 02:18:48,879
Let's go.

1859
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:53,040
Come...

1860
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,639
The pedal is complete.

1861
02:18:54,639 --> 02:18:55,440
The whole pedal.

1862
02:18:56,159 --> 02:18:58,000
Two hours and 19 minutes.

1863
02:18:58,559 --> 02:19:04,690
Now we're gonna put the Joy-Con in.

1864
02:19:04,690 --> 02:19:06,049
It's time to take a quick little pedal.

1865
02:19:06,049 --> 02:19:06,450
Joy-Con.

1866
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:07,010
Get the Joy-Con.

1867
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:08,129
Get the blue one.

1868
02:19:08,129 --> 02:19:08,770
This one.

1869
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:10,129
For those of you keeping track at home.

1870
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:11,649
Those of you at home.

1871
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:24,440
Shut up, Nightwing.

1872
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:26,200
Wow.

1873
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,340
I guess this comes all the way down.

1874
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,540
Push the pedal all the way down with one hand and hold it there.

1875
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,319
And it goes in like this.

1876
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:47,520
That's gonna break, man.

1877
02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:53,250
Slide the Joy-Con into the hole with the minus button sticking out.

1878
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:53,889
Make sure it's in.

1879
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:59,489
How far in does it have to go?

1880
02:20:02,579 --> 02:20:03,379
All the way.

1881
02:20:03,379 --> 02:20:04,340
All the way.

1882
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:05,059
That's what it said.

1883
02:20:05,059 --> 02:20:05,459
That's what...

1884
02:20:09,879 --> 02:20:10,360
I can see.

1885
02:20:11,079 --> 02:20:11,959
What the fuck?

1886
02:20:11,959 --> 02:20:13,319
You just got rid of the blockage.

1887
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:13,559
All right.

1888
02:20:13,559 --> 02:20:13,799
Good.

1889
02:20:15,159 --> 02:20:24,709
A little wonky but it's all right.

1890
02:20:24,709 --> 02:20:37,329
Why am I doing that?

1891
02:20:37,329 --> 02:20:38,020
All right.

1892
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:38,659
Step on...

1893
02:20:38,659 --> 02:20:39,780
Step on me all you like.

1894
02:20:40,579 --> 02:20:44,440
Play now.

1895
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:47,989
There's a game to play?

1896
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:49,670
Hold on.

1897
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,829
Wait.

1898
02:20:49,829 --> 02:20:50,309
There's a game?

1899
02:20:50,309 --> 02:20:51,350
What about Game Right Play?

1900
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:55,200
We get to play a game already?

1901
02:21:14,469 --> 02:21:14,870
Yeah.

1902
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:41,989
Come on.

1903
02:21:41,989 --> 02:21:42,549
Come on.

1904
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:45,559
I did it.

1905
02:21:45,559 --> 02:21:46,840
I got first place.

1906
02:21:46,840 --> 02:22:36,239
Ow.

1907
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:36,799
It's just...

1908
02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:37,200
Okay.

1909
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,799
It's that game with the little...

1910
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:41,280
You have the trigger and the hold of your...

1911
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:41,840
You know what I mean.

1912
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:42,239
You got...

1913
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:43,520
That's a weird foot.

1914
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:43,760
Hold on.

1915
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:44,479
Let me get...

1916
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:44,719
Hold on.

1917
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:45,520
Let me get my foot up there.

1918
02:22:55,969 --> 02:22:59,540
I can see my hands.

1919
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:05,079
It's okay.

1920
02:23:05,079 --> 02:23:06,280
You can see me.

1921
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:06,840
Never mind.

1922
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:08,340
All right.

1923
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:08,979
That was fun.

1924
02:23:08,979 --> 02:23:10,659
I want to build the rest before people scream.

1925
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,540
No, I didn't want to exit.

1926
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:14,979
Titan Quest?

1927
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:31,360
All right.

1928
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:31,920
It works.

1929
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,719
So let's get back.

1930
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:46,229
You can have more than one person play this.

1931
02:23:46,229 --> 02:23:47,110
Slot cards.

1932
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:48,149
Circuit.

1933
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:51,590
Pedal key and spray can.

1934
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:54,399
What does this mean?

1935
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,399
Meet the team.

1936
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,639
Oh, there you are, Jeremy.

1937
02:23:58,639 --> 02:23:59,520
That's how it's my name.

1938
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:03,670
I've been watching you through your webcam.

1939
02:24:04,629 --> 02:24:08,319
Are you spying on me?

1940
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:09,440
You'll never take me alive.

1941
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:27,139
I'm a little busy.

1942
02:24:29,719 --> 02:24:31,479
No, I wanted to make the rest.

1943
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:33,000
Sounds great.

1944
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:33,719
No, no.

1945
02:24:33,719 --> 02:24:34,040
Sorry.

1946
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:38,770
No, but I can sense your enthusiasm.

1947
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:41,649
From this day on, you are officially the fourth member of the Toy-Con development team.

1948
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:49,600
Okay.

1949
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:54,069
Technology wizard.

1950
02:24:54,709 --> 02:24:56,760
Just knows all kinds of things.

1951
02:24:56,760 --> 02:25:00,680
Oh, now let's introduce fucking Phineas.

1952
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,719
From Phineas and Ferb.

1953
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,440
They're all from the same fucking show.

1954
02:25:05,079 --> 02:25:05,579
Okay.

1955
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,799
Am I locked in a basement?

1956
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:30,239
I'm just like, I don't want to do it.

1957
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:31,280
No, no thanks.

1958
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:36,639
I don't know where you're doing it.

1959
02:25:36,639 --> 02:25:38,239
No, this is a spoiler.

1960
02:25:38,239 --> 02:25:38,879
Is that my hand?

1961
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:49,399
No, this is a spoiler.

1962
02:25:49,399 --> 02:25:50,200
This is a spoiler.

1963
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,319
I don't want to see the spoilers.

1964
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:53,079
This is a spoiler.

1965
02:26:12,530 --> 02:26:13,409
B doesn't do anything.

1966
02:26:15,319 --> 02:26:16,920
I have to press let's get started.

1967
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:30,360
All right.

1968
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:33,329
Back, back.

1969
02:26:35,729 --> 02:26:38,209
Now, this one is only going to take 15 minutes.

1970
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:40,389
This is the easy one.

1971
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:47,989
Wait till I elbow drop that before the stream is over.

1972
02:26:55,829 --> 02:26:57,190
No, time me on this one.

1973
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:58,149
I'm going to put a timer on it.

1974
02:26:58,149 --> 02:26:59,110
No, yeah.

1975
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:00,469
Yeah, that's what's going to happen for this one.

1976
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:05,159
I want a fucking 15 minute timer on the screen.

1977
02:27:05,959 --> 02:27:08,149
How do I add one?

1978
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:12,469
Let's give me 20 minutes.

1979
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,799
I have to get like a plugin or something, I think.

1980
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:29,670
I don't think I can do it from just an OBS.

1981
02:27:30,549 --> 02:27:32,629
Just recount for you.

1982
02:27:32,629 --> 02:27:33,129
Okay.

1983
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:35,600
Yeah, use your phone.

1984
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:36,559
Use your phone.

1985
02:27:38,069 --> 02:27:38,569
Damn it.

1986
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:48,450
I almost just locked my phone out for like three days.

1987
02:27:56,819 --> 02:27:57,319
Okay.

1988
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:58,200
You ready?

1989
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:00,950
Wait, hold on.

1990
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:06,040
Two steps, key and Joy-Con.

1991
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:07,079
I'm going to move this out of the way.

1992
02:28:07,719 --> 02:28:11,799
So it starts when I grab the paper.

1993
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,479
So I need C.

1994
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:22,899
This one is C, right?

1995
02:28:23,459 --> 02:28:25,969
Okay, so I grabbed it.

1996
02:28:26,610 --> 02:28:31,700
Okay, go.

1997
02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:36,770
Can you see it?

1998
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:39,590
That's such a bad...

1999
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:40,389
It's going to turn off.

2000
02:28:41,350 --> 02:28:42,709
That's going to turn off.

2001
02:28:42,709 --> 02:28:44,229
Like it's going to go to like my home screen.

2002
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:45,829
I can see it.

2003
02:28:45,829 --> 02:28:46,469
Okay, let's go.

2004
02:28:48,760 --> 02:29:12,870
What do I need?

2005
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:13,590
Empty, right?

2006
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:17,379
Empty.

2007
02:29:17,379 --> 02:29:18,420
Okay, all right.

2008
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:19,219
All right, let's go.

2009
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:21,299
I'm almost one minute.

2010
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:23,479
Let's start with the key.

2011
02:29:23,479 --> 02:29:23,959
This key.

2012
02:29:23,959 --> 02:29:24,520
This is the key.

2013
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:25,239
This one here.

2014
02:29:25,239 --> 02:29:25,799
That's a key.

2015
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:27,329
Make sure the piece...

2016
02:29:28,770 --> 02:29:29,250
Printing on it.

2017
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:29,750
Flip it.

2018
02:29:30,209 --> 02:29:33,620
There's so many folds here.

2019
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:35,540
It's going to take 20 minutes to do these folds.

2020
02:29:45,299 --> 02:29:45,799
Two.

2021
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:47,350
Three.

2022
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:49,030
Four.

2023
02:29:49,639 --> 02:29:50,139
Five.

2024
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:52,520
Six.

2025
02:29:54,069 --> 02:29:54,569
Seven.

2026
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,180
Eight.

2027
02:29:56,799 --> 02:29:57,739
Nine.

2028
02:29:57,739 --> 02:29:58,239
Time!

2029
02:29:58,239 --> 02:29:59,840
One minute and 30 seconds.

2030
02:30:00,879 --> 02:30:01,379
Seven.

2031
02:30:02,190 --> 02:30:02,690
Eight.

2032
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:04,340
Nine.

2033
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:06,420
Two.

2034
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:06,920
Three.

2035
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:08,559
All folded.

2036
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:09,059
All done.

2037
02:30:09,059 --> 02:30:09,559
Go!

2038
02:30:09,559 --> 02:30:10,079
What's next?

2039
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:10,579
What's next?

2040
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:35,659
Stop doing like a bad posture thing.

2041
02:30:35,659 --> 02:30:36,379
Like I'm doing like...

2042
02:30:36,379 --> 02:30:38,139
I'm trying to get you guys to go bad posture.

2043
02:30:38,139 --> 02:30:39,020
I don't know why.

2044
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:41,389
This comes up.

2045
02:30:41,389 --> 02:30:42,270
Slides through.

2046
02:30:42,829 --> 02:30:44,600
Like that.

2047
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:47,969
Then in.

2048
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:51,209
Nice and snug.

2049
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:54,020
That knee.

2050
02:31:02,239 --> 02:31:02,739
This.

2051
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,569
Same thing on the other side.

2052
02:31:04,569 --> 02:31:06,090
It goes down and around.

2053
02:31:06,090 --> 02:31:11,069
Makes a little cube.

2054
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:13,379
Like that.

2055
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:17,700
Use a locking piece to hold everything in place.

2056
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:18,979
Flip a piece over and fold it in half.

2057
02:31:23,659 --> 02:31:24,159
Three minutes.

2058
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:26,700
Three minutes.

2059
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,299
That's not going to...

2060
02:31:28,299 --> 02:31:29,260
I'm not going to be close.

2061
02:31:30,059 --> 02:31:32,579
So it goes like that.

2062
02:31:32,579 --> 02:31:33,860
This one popped out a little bit.

2063
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:36,899
Okay.

2064
02:31:36,899 --> 02:31:39,299
So then it goes in here like this.

2065
02:31:42,459 --> 02:31:43,260
So that's locked.

2066
02:31:43,819 --> 02:31:44,770
Spray through.

2067
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:47,260
Just a moment.

2068
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:49,420
Take a check that yours looks like this.

2069
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:49,920
It does.

2070
02:31:50,379 --> 02:31:52,299
The two knobby bits poking up from one side.

2071
02:31:52,299 --> 02:31:52,780
It's in.

2072
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:53,659
It looks like that.

2073
02:31:53,659 --> 02:31:54,540
It looks beautiful.

2074
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:56,940
Looks better than your picture.

2075
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,440
Dickhead.

2076
02:31:58,139 --> 02:31:58,459
All right.

2077
02:31:58,459 --> 02:31:58,780
No.

2078
02:31:58,780 --> 02:31:59,579
That was mean.

2079
02:31:59,579 --> 02:32:01,020
Now this piece may be small but it's tough.

2080
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,020
Be sure to fold it cleanly and firmly.

2081
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:04,780
These long thin bits are a bit tricky.

2082
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:05,659
Use both hands.

2083
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:19,389
I can feel the bass drum in my brain.

2084
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:24,209
Is it loud?

2085
02:32:24,209 --> 02:32:25,170
Should I turn it down?

2086
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:32,239
I don't know what the music sounds like because I can't hear it.

2087
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:35,280
Somebody said that.

2088
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:36,000
I didn't say that.

2089
02:32:38,579 --> 02:32:39,139
Four minutes.

2090
02:32:46,829 --> 02:32:47,469
No one said...

2091
02:32:47,469 --> 02:32:48,030
Yes they did.

2092
02:32:48,909 --> 02:32:50,190
Yes they did.

2093
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:51,229
I can hear the...

2094
02:32:51,229 --> 02:32:51,709
Scroll up.

2095
02:32:51,709 --> 02:32:52,510
You'll see it.

2096
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:53,870
I want the guy that said it.

2097
02:32:53,950 --> 02:32:54,590
Come clean here.

2098
02:32:55,229 --> 02:33:04,610
This piece just won't come out.

2099
02:33:06,319 --> 02:33:07,840
Just perforate it already.

2100
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:08,719
Why do I have to do this?

2101
02:33:11,489 --> 02:33:15,790
All right.

2102
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:16,829
Fold it back.

2103
02:33:17,389 --> 02:33:17,629
Back.

2104
02:33:21,389 --> 02:33:22,190
Like this.

2105
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:22,989
Oh this is...

2106
02:33:22,989 --> 02:33:24,750
I gotta be careful here for real because this will rip.

2107
02:33:25,309 --> 02:33:26,899
This one comes back.

2108
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:29,100
This one comes back.

2109
02:33:31,979 --> 02:33:32,540
Oh man.

2110
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:34,299
There's so many little tiny pieces here.

2111
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:40,700
Okay.

2112
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:42,059
Just fold them all.

2113
02:33:44,750 --> 02:33:48,930
What's that thing from Roblox?

2114
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,979
Wash your hands.

2115
02:34:10,979 --> 02:34:11,700
Wash your hair.

2116
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:14,399
What are you talking about?

2117
02:34:14,399 --> 02:34:15,200
My hair is clean.

2118
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:19,379
I take a shower every day.

2119
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:21,459
Every single day.

2120
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,239
Every single day.

2121
02:34:32,979 --> 02:34:34,579
Every tiny little piece needed.

2122
02:34:34,579 --> 02:34:36,020
15 minutes my ass.

2123
02:34:37,059 --> 02:34:39,700
This even...

2124
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:42,579
This little folding bit alone is going to take 15 minutes.

2125
02:34:43,379 --> 02:34:48,340
You don't take a shower three times a day.

2126
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:49,860
Who takes a shower three times a day?

2127
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:54,079
Do you work in like the mud pits?

2128
02:34:54,079 --> 02:34:54,639
Like I don't...

2129
02:34:54,639 --> 02:34:56,079
Like do you work in like the mud?

2130
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:00,020
You know what I mean?

2131
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:00,579
Like you got that...

2132
02:35:01,139 --> 02:35:01,540
You got...

2133
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:02,020
That's like...

2134
02:35:02,819 --> 02:35:09,229
I can understand if you worked like in like a place where you need to do it.

2135
02:35:09,950 --> 02:35:12,940
All right.

2136
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:13,420
That's done.

2137
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:15,229
Now where does it go?

2138
02:35:16,030 --> 02:35:17,309
Wine should not be on the table.

2139
02:35:17,309 --> 02:35:18,590
Nice fucking walnut desk.

2140
02:35:19,389 --> 02:35:57,120
I can't even put it on this.

2141
02:35:59,229 --> 02:35:59,870
Seven minutes.

2142
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:10,000
Am I doing this right?

2143
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:10,559
Yes I am.

2144
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:27,790
That piece sticks in there.

2145
02:36:28,590 --> 02:36:34,690
Right?

2146
02:36:34,690 --> 02:36:34,930
Okay.

2147
02:36:35,569 --> 02:36:41,790
Fold, fold, up.

2148
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:45,180
Fold, fold, up, in.

2149
02:36:45,819 --> 02:36:47,579
And then what the hell does this thing do?

2150
02:36:47,579 --> 02:36:48,459
In and then down?

2151
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:51,540
It's in.

2152
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:52,340
Okay.

2153
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:52,659
Look.

2154
02:36:53,379 --> 02:36:54,260
Examine my work.

2155
02:36:56,739 --> 02:36:56,979
Okay.

2156
02:36:58,819 --> 02:36:59,620
Now check the other side.

2157
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:01,620
You should see the tip through the opening.

2158
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:05,329
Do I?

2159
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:08,590
Kind of.

2160
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:10,270
Yeah, I do.

2161
02:37:10,989 --> 02:37:15,219
The main part of the key is complete.

2162
02:37:15,219 --> 02:37:19,020
Mine's not even kind of fucked up.

2163
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:20,219
847.

2164
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:24,770
Some sort of many armed alien.

2165
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:32,030
This piece requires extra clean folds.

2166
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:33,469
Be sure to crease carefully along the fold line.

2167
02:37:33,469 --> 02:37:34,190
It's just like on screen.

2168
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:35,389
The end result might surprise you.

2169
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:45,120
Extra clean folds.

2170
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:48,659
Can you think of anything else that has four arms

2171
02:37:48,659 --> 02:37:49,219
and two heads?

2172
02:37:49,219 --> 02:37:49,620
I can't.

2173
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:51,219
Are we dealing with a new life form here?

2174
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:54,129
If I had wine in my mouth,

2175
02:37:54,129 --> 02:37:55,409
I would have spit it into the camera.

2176
02:37:55,969 --> 02:37:57,299
All right, hold on.

2177
02:38:00,670 --> 02:38:02,909
Three showers per fold.

2178
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:11,489
Extra careful.

2179
02:38:12,930 --> 02:38:14,129
Wine drunk.

2180
02:38:14,129 --> 02:38:15,950
Wine is great.

2181
02:38:17,329 --> 02:38:19,170
You want to talk crap about wine?

2182
02:38:19,170 --> 02:38:20,770
You ever have a red blend before?

2183
02:38:22,670 --> 02:38:23,229
No.

2184
02:38:23,229 --> 02:38:28,879
I want to have a fucking vodka Cosmo drink.

2185
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:30,399
Oh, please.

2186
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,239
Drink a red blend, for Christ sakes.

2187
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:37,979
Oh, yeah.

2188
02:38:37,979 --> 02:38:41,500
Do you guys make a sex on the beach?

2189
02:38:42,139 --> 02:38:44,379
Get fucking red blend for once in your life.

2190
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:56,370
He's a mean drunk.

2191
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:00,139
I'm telling you.

2192
02:39:00,139 --> 02:39:01,459
You'll drink cheap.

2193
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:04,270
So this now goes in here.

2194
02:39:04,909 --> 02:39:07,360
Which way?

2195
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:09,760
So the prongs out that way, like that.

2196
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:12,780
And it's going to shove in 10 minutes.

2197
02:39:13,579 --> 02:39:18,319
See, there are two different tabs on the button.

2198
02:39:18,319 --> 02:39:20,399
One with a notch, one without.

2199
02:39:20,399 --> 02:39:22,159
Look carefully at the screen when putting it in.

2200
02:39:22,959 --> 02:39:25,069
I know what I'm doing.

2201
02:39:25,069 --> 02:39:27,969
So right through here.

2202
02:39:28,690 --> 02:39:32,579
I mean, it can't really go anywhere.

2203
02:39:33,139 --> 02:39:35,059
It just sits here like that.

2204
02:39:41,899 --> 02:39:43,500
Unidentified life form approaching.

2205
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:44,299
Red alert.

2206
02:39:44,299 --> 02:39:44,940
Red blend.

2207
02:39:46,819 --> 02:39:48,180
Place it right over the button.

2208
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:49,940
It looks right at home there, don't you think?

2209
02:39:50,659 --> 02:40:01,040
I mean, kind of, I guess.

2210
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:09,629
That's in there.

2211
02:40:09,629 --> 02:40:10,670
It's not really secure, though.

2212
02:40:12,579 --> 02:40:15,700
Fold both of these top arms down so the tabs fit tightly into the openings.

2213
02:40:15,700 --> 02:40:17,459
We're starting to get this alien out of control.

2214
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:21,969
Okay.

2215
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:29,120
Come on, Nintendo.

2216
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:30,879
You can do better than this.

2217
02:40:40,579 --> 02:40:40,899
Okay.

2218
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,420
That's fine.

2219
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:43,540
So that's in.

2220
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:44,100
Both in.

2221
02:40:44,739 --> 02:40:46,739
He's riding on whatever this is.

2222
02:40:50,510 --> 02:40:51,870
Now, just to be sure it won't escape,

2223
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:53,709
let's fold its head down between its arms.

2224
02:40:54,989 --> 02:40:57,840
I didn't fold these.

2225
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:00,000
I don't think I do, though.

2226
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,420
Look at that.

2227
02:41:04,879 --> 02:41:05,120
Ooh.

2228
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:06,559
That fits nice.

2229
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:10,930
Eat dinner on stream or it's pre-recorded.

2230
02:41:11,889 --> 02:41:14,430
I'm not going to eat fucking dinner on stream.

2231
02:41:15,309 --> 02:41:18,190
Fold the arms down, same thing.

2232
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:19,469
We're going to do the same thing on the other side.

2233
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:23,459
Eat dinner.

2234
02:41:26,940 --> 02:41:28,379
Why would I do something like that?

2235
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:36,299
Okay.

2236
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:38,930
This is kind of loose.

2237
02:41:39,569 --> 02:41:42,219
It's supposed to be like that.

2238
02:41:47,549 --> 02:41:52,639
Keep 13 minutes and 19 minutes.

2239
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,239
Stop.

2240
02:41:54,239 --> 02:41:55,040
Thank you.

2241
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:56,719
15 to 30 minutes, huh?

2242
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:01,170
I fucking owned that.

2243
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:07,520
How do I put this in?

2244
02:42:08,079 --> 02:42:14,180
Get the Joy-Con arm ready.

2245
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,540
It's the one with the plus button.

2246
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:16,819
Yes, I know which one it is.

2247
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:21,809
I can hear the baits in my brain.

2248
02:42:27,149 --> 02:42:34,340
So open this slot and it looks like a Pez dispenser.

2249
02:42:35,219 --> 02:42:42,819
And then this goes in.

2250
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:50,690
Close it and put the key in like that.

2251
02:42:51,649 --> 02:42:56,850
That's in.

2252
02:42:58,350 --> 02:43:03,860
And then close this and fold it back and stick it in there.

2253
02:43:05,219 --> 02:43:08,350
Done.

2254
02:43:08,350 --> 02:43:11,379
I win.

2255
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:15,709
I win.

2256
02:43:15,709 --> 02:43:16,829
Try pushing the button and the key.

2257
02:43:16,829 --> 02:43:19,149
If it pops back out after you push it, we're good to go.

2258
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:37,520
Is that?

2259
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:38,879
I don't think that's good to go.

2260
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:44,420
Maybe it is.

2261
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:44,899
No, it is.

2262
02:43:44,899 --> 02:43:45,379
It is.

2263
02:43:45,379 --> 02:43:45,860
It is.

2264
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:46,579
It's fine.

2265
02:43:46,579 --> 02:43:46,979
It's fine.

2266
02:43:46,979 --> 02:43:47,540
It's going to be fine.

2267
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:51,100
Toy key is complete.

2268
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:51,500
We got the key.

2269
02:43:51,500 --> 02:43:52,059
We got the pedal.

2270
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:55,180
I'm ready to start fucking losing it.

2271
02:43:55,979 --> 02:43:56,299
All right.

2272
02:43:56,299 --> 02:43:57,420
Time to make the car.

2273
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:01,899
Welcome to the next four hours.

2274
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:21,250
150 to 210 minutes.

2275
02:44:22,049 --> 02:44:28,270
See you guys in the next 10 hours.

2276
02:44:29,309 --> 02:44:30,030
I'm doing it all.

2277
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:31,600
You know what I mean?

2278
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:34,299
I don't care how long this takes.

2279
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:45,139
I'll be here in one spring.

2280
02:44:45,950 --> 02:44:47,229
This is not turning off until it's done.

2281
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:51,649
I'm fucking ready.

2282
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:20,940
Let's go.

2283
02:45:21,979 --> 02:45:22,540
Wheel.

2284
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:23,340
Wheel base.

2285
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:23,899
Wheel.

2286
02:45:23,899 --> 02:45:24,620
Seven steps.

2287
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:26,299
Make the steering wheel.

2288
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:29,309
Remove this one piece from sheet A.

2289
02:45:29,309 --> 02:45:31,229
It'll form the steering wheel for your car.

2290
02:45:34,579 --> 02:45:37,219
For some reason, my changer sucks.

2291
02:45:37,219 --> 02:45:38,979
I can't like, gotta do it the right way.

2292
02:45:40,239 --> 02:45:40,879
There we go.

2293
02:45:40,879 --> 02:45:43,139
I got it.

2294
02:45:43,139 --> 02:45:44,659
I need to like figure this out.

2295
02:45:44,659 --> 02:45:44,899
All right.

2296
02:45:44,899 --> 02:45:47,379
Don't forget if you have a fucking problem, call somebody.

2297
02:45:48,020 --> 02:45:55,780
You'll be able to play Adventure as soon as you finish building the Toy-Con car.

2298
02:45:56,829 --> 02:45:57,469
Adventure.

2299
02:45:58,030 --> 02:45:58,670
What does that mean?

2300
02:46:02,209 --> 02:46:03,090
Family circus.

2301
02:46:04,559 --> 02:46:06,879
I can't, guys, here's the fucking problem.

2302
02:46:06,879 --> 02:46:08,319
I can't skip.

2303
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:14,940
I can't go fast because the key is in here.

2304
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:15,819
What piece do I need?

2305
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:20,610
Oh, he did a funny noise.

2306
02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:23,809
Now I'm making a call back to the fucking dumb family circus thing I said like

2307
02:46:23,809 --> 02:46:24,610
four hours ago.

2308
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:30,829
So I need the whole entire enterprise here.

2309
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:47,219
The whole thing is huge.

2310
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:53,090
I gotta get the whole pizza.

2311
02:46:56,299 --> 02:46:57,180
He just elbowed me.

2312
02:46:58,379 --> 02:47:01,280
Come on.

2313
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:02,000
No.

2314
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,979
That's it for this piece.

2315
02:47:07,979 --> 02:47:09,020
There's nothing else in here.

2316
02:47:11,299 --> 02:47:12,659
Just a spike trap now.

2317
02:47:14,319 --> 02:47:14,639
Okay.

2318
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:16,159
There it is.

2319
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:19,940
I hate that it's in here.

2320
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:20,659
Get it out of here.

2321
02:47:20,659 --> 02:47:21,459
I'll put it in later.

2322
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:24,909
Fuck off for an hour.

2323
02:47:25,629 --> 02:47:26,379
All right.

2324
02:47:26,379 --> 02:47:27,340
Here's the steering wheel.

2325
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:28,299
Let's put it together.

2326
02:47:28,299 --> 02:47:30,620
Don't forget if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons.

2327
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:30,860
Sure.

2328
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:32,459
You'll be able to punch these out.

2329
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:38,110
Pizza box, Labo, all over again.

2330
02:47:42,659 --> 02:47:43,379
Why is everybody freaking out?

2331
02:47:43,379 --> 02:47:43,879
What happened?

2332
02:47:45,709 --> 02:47:47,389
Like, why is everybody, what's wrong?

2333
02:47:47,389 --> 02:47:48,190
Why is everybody freaking out?

2334
02:47:48,989 --> 02:47:55,889
There's so many random pieces to pull out of here.

2335
02:47:56,530 --> 02:47:57,809
I was rude.

2336
02:47:57,809 --> 02:47:59,090
Wait, what did I, what did I do?

2337
02:47:59,090 --> 02:47:59,649
What did I say?

2338
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:02,530
What did I, what did I say?

2339
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:03,090
I was mean?

2340
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:03,729
How was I mean?

2341
02:48:03,729 --> 02:48:04,209
What did I say?

2342
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:10,399
I yelled at the key.

2343
02:48:14,159 --> 02:48:15,680
Oh, I'm sorry, key.

2344
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:18,479
I'm so rude to you.

2345
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:22,379
I just ripped it.

2346
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:28,260
Fuck off for an hour.

2347
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,979
I was talking, I was talking to the key and not, what?

2348
02:48:30,979 --> 02:48:33,659
There's so many little pieces.

2349
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:36,780
I'm gonna have a field day fucking cleaning this up.

2350
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:38,540
And I said I didn't want to mess this room up.

2351
02:48:40,059 --> 02:48:42,059
And here we are, messing the room up.

2352
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:43,680
What do you know?

2353
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:45,440
What else is new?

2354
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:49,180
Different states, same bullshit.

2355
02:48:51,579 --> 02:48:52,860
Still ruining rooms.

2356
02:48:53,819 --> 02:48:54,459
2018.

2357
02:48:55,579 --> 02:49:04,819
Is that it?

2358
02:49:04,819 --> 02:49:06,930
This middle thing has to come out somehow.

2359
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:11,459
Can the middle thing even come out?

2360
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:16,860
Okay.

2361
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:20,180
I mean, it's getting close.

2362
02:49:21,059 --> 02:49:24,500
Oh, all the HDMI ports have to come out.

2363
02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:34,000
All the HDMI ports have to come out.

2364
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:34,500
2018.

2365
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:50,739
Looking closer, right?

2366
02:49:50,739 --> 02:49:52,420
One, two, three, and all the pieces.

2367
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:53,379
Just these corners.

2368
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:55,299
These corners come out too.

2369
02:50:00,079 --> 02:50:00,959
Are you stoned?

2370
02:50:02,379 --> 02:50:03,180
I don't think so.

2371
02:50:03,979 --> 02:50:07,090
I don't believe I am.

2372
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:07,729
I don't think so.

2373
02:50:12,129 --> 02:50:12,530
Fuck it.

2374
02:50:12,530 --> 02:50:12,850
Whatever.

2375
02:50:12,850 --> 02:50:13,729
That's fine.

2376
02:50:13,729 --> 02:50:32,159
Okay, I'm ready.

2377
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:34,559
You missed an HDMI?

2378
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:34,879
Fuck it.

2379
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:35,440
We'll be fine.

2380
02:50:38,129 --> 02:50:38,850
Okay, let's go.

2381
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:45,229
Before we turn the piece off, we'll want to crease

2382
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:48,030
the four lines on these four tabs.

2383
02:50:48,030 --> 02:50:49,229
Boop, boop, boop, boopity boop.

2384
02:50:49,229 --> 02:50:50,030
That's all four.

2385
02:50:50,030 --> 02:50:50,530
Okay.

2386
02:50:51,069 --> 02:51:03,819
That wasn't a funny voice.

2387
02:51:04,989 --> 02:51:06,430
Guys, I wouldn't be doing this.

2388
02:51:06,430 --> 02:51:08,270
I would be doing this if I was alone too.

2389
02:51:08,270 --> 02:51:09,790
I would be saying Thanos lines.

2390
02:51:10,590 --> 02:51:13,709
It's done.

2391
02:51:13,709 --> 02:51:15,250
Flip the whole thing around.

2392
02:51:15,809 --> 02:51:21,739
Just gives us this.

2393
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:29,520
Got any more brain busters, Nintendo?

2394
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:33,260
Oh, whoops.

2395
02:51:40,610 --> 02:51:43,100
We got five more gifted subs.

2396
02:51:44,049 --> 02:51:46,450
Five gifted subs from Bet3.

2397
02:51:46,450 --> 02:51:47,329
Thank you so much, dude.

2398
02:51:53,549 --> 02:51:56,350
Even more subs on top of the ones that were from before.

2399
02:51:56,350 --> 02:51:57,149
Thank you guys so much.

2400
02:51:57,149 --> 02:51:58,750
You guys are fucking amazing.

2401
02:51:58,750 --> 02:51:59,069
Thank you.

2402
02:52:01,389 --> 02:52:01,889
Bet3.

2403
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:04,379
Fold every single one of these.

2404
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:05,520
God.

2405
02:52:06,219 --> 02:52:09,260
Can I put this in a machine and have it do it for me?

2406
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:21,379
Buy it pre-made.

2407
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:24,819
One skit.

2408
02:52:24,819 --> 02:52:26,260
I gotta go all the way around.

2409
02:52:26,260 --> 02:52:27,219
It's gotta do it, you know?

2410
02:52:27,219 --> 02:52:28,180
You gotta put your pants on.

2411
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:28,659
You gotta do it.

2412
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:33,040
It does sound really nice when you do it each time, though.

2413
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:37,459
So I have a question for everybody that's here.

2414
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:41,229
Am I the only person on Twitch that's done this?

2415
02:52:41,790 --> 02:52:43,229
On stream like the whole thing?

2416
02:52:43,229 --> 02:52:43,729
All of them?

2417
02:52:48,909 --> 02:52:49,629
No.

2418
02:52:49,629 --> 02:52:52,770
I want to meet that person.

2419
02:52:55,739 --> 02:52:57,979
Matters of Darkness came in with five community subs.

2420
02:52:57,979 --> 02:52:58,700
Thank you so much.

2421
02:53:02,579 --> 02:53:04,579
You are literally the only person to ever do it.

2422
02:53:06,319 --> 02:53:09,680
That's big, big community subs coming in from Matters of Darkness.

2423
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,120
On top of the ones from earlier.

2424
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:12,000
Thank you so much, dude.

2425
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:13,520
I don't want to-

2426
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:14,799
I really don't know what to say at this point.

2427
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:16,399
You guys are fucking too much for me.

2428
02:53:19,459 --> 02:53:21,219
You're not the first, but you're definitely the slowest.

2429
02:53:22,020 --> 02:53:45,940
How many total community subs tonight?

2430
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:47,219
Probably 150.

2431
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:48,819
Something crazy.

2432
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:52,059
Go around the inner circle.

2433
02:53:56,030 --> 02:53:56,510
And the-

2434
02:53:56,510 --> 02:53:56,989
In the-

2435
02:53:56,989 --> 02:53:57,950
In the core, too?

2436
02:53:57,950 --> 02:53:58,989
We gotta go in the core!

2437
02:53:59,950 --> 02:54:25,500
Look how patronizing he's being when this wheel is trying its best.

2438
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:31,649
That's one of my favorite comment of the whole night.

2439
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:33,010
That was great.

2440
02:54:33,649 --> 02:54:34,370
All right, let's go.

2441
02:54:35,569 --> 02:54:40,290
Each individual piece has to come up.

2442
02:54:41,010 --> 02:54:45,280
I'm gonna feel so satisfied

2443
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:49,600
when I smash this with the sledgehammer that's back there in the closet.

2444
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:50,879
You didn't know?

2445
02:54:50,879 --> 02:54:52,559
That's the big joke at the end of the stream.

2446
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:54,079
Sludgehammer?

2447
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:56,719
He bought a sledgehammer for this?

2448
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:58,719
Yeah, he sure did.

2449
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:01,440
And boy, is it gonna be messy.

2450
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:13,299
Whoa, cool.

2451
02:55:13,299 --> 02:55:16,260
Whoa, holy shit, he sledgehammered the labo.

2452
02:55:16,260 --> 02:55:17,299
What the-

2453
02:55:17,299 --> 02:55:19,059
He still has it in his hand.

2454
02:55:19,059 --> 02:55:20,579
The adrenaline's like getting to him.

2455
02:55:20,579 --> 02:55:21,059
Wait, hold on.

2456
02:55:21,059 --> 02:55:22,739
He's sledgehammering his computer.

2457
02:55:23,620 --> 02:55:24,579
What the fuck?

2458
02:55:24,579 --> 02:55:25,139
What face?

2459
02:55:25,940 --> 02:55:28,350
Did I break it?

2460
02:55:28,350 --> 02:55:28,909
No.

2461
02:55:28,909 --> 02:55:30,659
Did I?

2462
02:55:30,659 --> 02:55:32,579
Dude, he sledgehammered his computer?

2463
02:55:32,579 --> 02:55:34,100
Dude, he's sledgehammering his walls.

2464
02:55:34,979 --> 02:55:36,340
What the fuck face?

2465
02:55:42,059 --> 02:55:43,340
Everything has to happen.

2466
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:49,899
Dude, he ran off camera

2467
02:55:49,899 --> 02:55:51,819
and I still hear crashing and smashing.

2468
02:55:52,379 --> 02:56:31,170
Whoa!

2469
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:32,690
There's that HDMI port I missed.

2470
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:34,979
I should just do these at the same time.

2471
02:56:34,979 --> 02:56:36,899
This is gonna feel really cool putting it together though

2472
02:56:36,899 --> 02:56:38,739
because all these slots have a home.

2473
02:56:42,979 --> 02:56:44,340
Every single slot has a home.

2474
02:56:45,659 --> 02:56:46,459
They-

2475
02:56:46,459 --> 02:56:48,459
Slots go this way and they go into their home.

2476
02:56:52,799 --> 02:56:53,520
One of my fucking-

2477
02:56:54,319 --> 02:56:55,200
Can I show you something?

2478
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:58,159
I can't.

2479
02:56:58,159 --> 02:56:58,879
Almost all-

2480
02:56:58,879 --> 02:57:01,280
Half of my fucking wall paneling is falling down.

2481
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:05,979
Command strips, don't do shit.

2482
02:57:09,729 --> 02:57:10,770
Another one just fell down.

2483
02:57:13,659 --> 02:57:15,659
Okay, we are done.

2484
02:57:16,459 --> 02:57:17,739
It's time to put it all together.

2485
02:57:19,809 --> 02:57:24,590
Here's the 130 minute stream that they were describing.

2486
02:57:25,649 --> 02:57:29,329
They weren't kidding around when they said it was gonna take 130 stream minutes.

2487
02:57:30,049 --> 02:57:32,129
Put it all together, right?

2488
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:34,659
Or wrong?

2489
02:57:34,659 --> 02:57:40,739
Good red blend.

2490
02:57:44,450 --> 02:57:44,770
Wrong.

2491
02:57:45,329 --> 02:57:56,190
Okay, this comes up and then these go down.

2492
02:58:05,540 --> 02:58:05,860
That.

2493
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,819
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2494
02:58:11,819 --> 02:58:12,780
It's the second one.

2495
02:58:13,579 --> 02:58:16,340
So this is, you know, in the middle.

2496
02:58:17,219 --> 02:58:18,899
I feel like I'm gonna get cut.

2497
02:58:18,899 --> 02:58:20,020
This is like a saw blade.

2498
02:58:21,579 --> 02:58:35,340
That comes down and then these pieces here fold like that.

2499
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:37,420
And then in.

2500
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:37,920
Oy.

2501
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:39,639
Oy.

2502
02:58:40,780 --> 02:58:41,280
In.

2503
02:58:42,719 --> 02:58:43,219
In.

2504
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:49,979
There's so many tabs to put in.

2505
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:57,899
Nintendo Labo like katana saw blade.

2506
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:03,299
Fatality.

2507
02:59:03,299 --> 02:59:06,739
Just do them all.

2508
02:59:09,100 --> 02:59:11,579
Did I, did it flip over?

2509
02:59:12,139 --> 02:59:22,909
Why did, did I do this wrong?

2510
02:59:28,030 --> 02:59:32,700
No.

2511
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:33,180
Friendship.

2512
02:59:33,739 --> 02:59:34,299
Friendship.

2513
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:35,360
Again.

2514
02:59:45,340 --> 02:59:46,219
Blind streamer.

2515
02:59:46,219 --> 02:59:46,620
Blind.

2516
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:47,340
Blind streamer.

2517
02:59:47,340 --> 02:59:47,819
He's blind.

2518
02:59:47,819 --> 02:59:48,379
He's blind.

2519
02:59:48,379 --> 02:59:48,780
Blind.

2520
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:49,819
He's blind.

2521
02:59:49,819 --> 02:59:52,590
That's an unknown reference.

2522
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:55,389
Go play Mortal Kombat 3, you fucking idiot.

2523
02:59:56,030 --> 03:00:01,629
You know, I'm kidding.

2524
03:00:01,629 --> 03:00:02,270
That was a joke.

2525
03:00:07,549 --> 03:00:08,909
I'm, that was, I'm kidding.

2526
03:00:08,909 --> 03:00:09,549
I'm kidding.

2527
03:00:09,549 --> 03:00:11,040
I'm kidding.

2528
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:14,399
He's getting toxic.

2529
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:18,190
The more wine he drinks, he becomes more toxic.

2530
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:25,040
No, that's in Mortal Kombat 3.

2531
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:28,959
I was just kidding.

2532
03:00:28,959 --> 03:00:30,079
Look, hey, come on.

2533
03:00:35,469 --> 03:00:36,909
Rewind to yesterday.

2534
03:00:38,719 --> 03:00:40,559
Oh, sleepy.

2535
03:00:44,239 --> 03:00:47,920
Everybody calls me an idiot when I'm like walking around in Red Dead.

2536
03:00:48,879 --> 03:00:50,319
Oh wow, you're an idiot.

2537
03:00:50,879 --> 03:00:53,389
Why is that okay?

2538
03:00:54,030 --> 03:01:04,430
He sounds so, I'm kidding.

2539
03:01:08,299 --> 03:01:14,049
Stop ignoring my question.

2540
03:01:14,049 --> 03:01:15,409
Tell us your sub count.

2541
03:01:15,409 --> 03:01:16,770
I don't, I don't know.

2542
03:01:16,770 --> 03:01:17,250
What is it?

2543
03:01:18,909 --> 03:01:19,950
65,000.

2544
03:01:23,809 --> 03:01:25,729
Like, I'm not ignoring your, what?

2545
03:01:25,729 --> 03:01:26,930
Stop ignoring my question.

2546
03:01:26,930 --> 03:01:28,530
How much money is in your bank account?

2547
03:01:29,090 --> 03:01:34,690
I'm probably gonna have to do all these, right?

2548
03:01:42,879 --> 03:01:44,559
Yeah, I've got to do every single one.

2549
03:01:50,319 --> 03:01:51,440
That's more than everybody here.

2550
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:53,280
Yeah, there's like 3,000 people there.

2551
03:01:53,280 --> 03:02:02,129
That's correct, right?

2552
03:02:03,389 --> 03:02:03,950
I think so.

2553
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:06,590
Yep, right.

2554
03:02:06,590 --> 03:02:07,870
You knew it was gonna have to happen, right?

2555
03:02:13,250 --> 03:02:13,969
Tax returns.

2556
03:02:24,590 --> 03:02:25,469
Look out.

2557
03:02:25,469 --> 03:02:27,309
Oh, a plane went by?

2558
03:02:27,309 --> 03:02:27,809
Yeah.

2559
03:02:28,530 --> 03:02:29,170
Vegas, man.

2560
03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:32,049
People all over the place.

2561
03:02:32,770 --> 03:02:38,540
I heard a cat outside yesterday.

2562
03:02:40,190 --> 03:02:42,750
That, I thought it was like a weird like high-pitched voice.

2563
03:02:42,750 --> 03:02:43,389
And I was like, what the fuck?

2564
03:02:43,389 --> 03:02:45,840
It was like, give me all your money.

2565
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:46,959
And I was like, what the fuck is this?

2566
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:48,879
It was high-pitched.

2567
03:02:48,879 --> 03:02:50,959
And I went and said it was a cat holding somebody up on the street.

2568
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:53,250
It made no sense.

2569
03:02:53,250 --> 03:02:54,049
And he had an eye patch.

2570
03:02:54,690 --> 03:02:59,549
I was like, holy shit, we're in Vegas, man.

2571
03:03:02,290 --> 03:03:02,790
Done.

2572
03:03:06,639 --> 03:03:07,360
In an iPad.

2573
03:03:08,319 --> 03:03:09,120
All right, that's it.

2574
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:15,709
That was just a Jay Leno joke.

2575
03:03:17,819 --> 03:03:18,780
Yeah, it was.

2576
03:03:19,420 --> 03:03:39,459
He probably made that already.

2577
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:45,819
Don't look at me.

2578
03:03:46,379 --> 03:03:47,500
I'm not here.

2579
03:03:47,500 --> 03:03:48,590
I got a cup though.

2580
03:03:48,590 --> 03:03:49,629
You see that cup?

2581
03:03:49,629 --> 03:03:52,379
Pretty deep.

2582
03:03:52,379 --> 03:03:54,780
All right, we're on step two of already step two.

2583
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:55,420
We're getting there.

2584
03:04:04,049 --> 03:04:05,569
A place to put these when they're done.

2585
03:04:06,209 --> 03:04:08,000
That could go right down there.

2586
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,280
I need B and C.

2587
03:04:11,709 --> 03:04:19,629
Why does Jerma always over-emote?

2588
03:04:21,889 --> 03:04:22,290
What?

2589
03:04:22,290 --> 03:04:22,930
Over-emote?

2590
03:04:22,930 --> 03:04:30,739
What do you mean over-emote?

2591
03:04:30,739 --> 03:04:31,379
Over-act?

2592
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:32,500
Over-emote?

2593
03:04:32,500 --> 03:04:34,020
I don't know what you mean over-emote.

2594
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:41,649
Empty.

2595
03:04:41,649 --> 03:04:48,579
And this laundry dryer washer thing.

2596
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:52,379
Stop over-emoting.

2597
03:04:55,889 --> 03:04:57,729
I haven't typed anything in the chat at all.

2598
03:04:58,290 --> 03:05:01,600
I've been talking to you guys, but you know.

2599
03:05:02,319 --> 03:05:07,760
So this is, I'm going to assume, is part of the base of the wheel.

2600
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:08,000
Right?

2601
03:05:11,760 --> 03:05:14,239
Emo-streamer wants to be Nightwing, but he's too fat.

2602
03:05:14,959 --> 03:05:26,399
All right, flipping around.

2603
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:28,959
All the folds, every single one, all the HDMI's have to come out.

2604
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:39,180
When is my collab with Critical?

2605
03:05:44,129 --> 03:05:45,010
Right now.

2606
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:48,049
Welcome into the chat, guys.

2607
03:05:48,049 --> 03:05:49,649
I have him on Discord here.

2608
03:05:49,649 --> 03:05:50,770
Critical, say hello.

2609
03:05:51,329 --> 03:06:07,389
Critical.

2610
03:06:07,389 --> 03:06:12,799
You hear him, man?

2611
03:06:12,799 --> 03:06:14,639
Ah, I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.

2612
03:06:14,639 --> 03:06:16,000
I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.

2613
03:06:16,639 --> 03:06:17,659
Shit, hello.

2614
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:35,219
No, I was going to hit him up, actually.

2615
03:06:35,940 --> 03:06:38,100
I was going to hit him up very soon.

2616
03:06:38,899 --> 03:06:49,549
When am I going to stream with Logic, Rick Morty, and Ninja?

2617
03:06:51,709 --> 03:07:00,700
That's all I got to say about that, is just, oi.

2618
03:07:04,350 --> 03:07:04,989
All right.

2619
03:07:04,989 --> 03:07:07,469
So, make sure I'm doing all this right.

2620
03:07:07,469 --> 03:07:13,629
This tab has to come up.

2621
03:07:15,629 --> 03:07:21,680
When are you going to collab with Jerma?

2622
03:07:22,559 --> 03:07:24,129
No, that guy over emotes.

2623
03:07:24,129 --> 03:07:26,370
I don't think I want to be in the same stream as him.

2624
03:07:27,090 --> 03:07:29,389
He has a really commanding presence.

2625
03:07:29,389 --> 03:07:31,469
He over talks and talks over everybody.

2626
03:07:32,670 --> 03:07:34,879
I don't follow his humor that really at all.

2627
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:44,559
I like Jerma.

2628
03:07:44,559 --> 03:07:48,670
Jerma's not bad, but like, it gets to a point, man.

2629
03:07:49,309 --> 03:07:53,219
You have anything else besides, like, I'll try to do the voice.

2630
03:07:53,219 --> 03:07:54,500
Like, don't have any cards, I guess.

2631
03:07:54,500 --> 03:07:55,540
Like, he does it all the time.

2632
03:07:55,540 --> 03:07:57,299
It's like, you have any other tricks up your sleeve, dude?

2633
03:07:58,340 --> 03:08:01,899
That is not meant to be like mean to him or anything.

2634
03:08:01,899 --> 03:08:02,940
I think he's like, cool.

2635
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:03,579
I think he's funny.

2636
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:10,559
I saw his Castle Griffith Steed video.

2637
03:08:10,559 --> 03:08:11,440
I mean, that was pretty cool.

2638
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:17,629
I heard he pays for bots to view his channel.

2639
03:08:23,540 --> 03:08:24,739
I'm going to go down that road.

2640
03:08:25,299 --> 03:08:26,020
All right, let's go.

2641
03:08:26,819 --> 03:08:33,549
Unsubbing, because you hate him.

2642
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,219
No, I don't hate him.

2643
03:08:35,219 --> 03:08:36,260
He's like, cool, I like him.

2644
03:08:41,149 --> 03:08:45,940
Am I going to play Smash with Vinny?

2645
03:08:46,979 --> 03:08:48,180
Fuck yeah, if he wants to.

2646
03:08:48,819 --> 03:08:51,360
When Smash comes out, I'll play it with anybody.

2647
03:08:51,360 --> 03:08:52,159
Because they're actually going to have,

2648
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:54,639
they'll have regional matchmaking,

2649
03:08:54,639 --> 03:08:56,399
which is something that they've like never done before.

2650
03:08:56,399 --> 03:08:57,280
So that's huge.

2651
03:08:58,159 --> 03:09:07,520
Plus, you ever spend more than a couple days

2652
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:08,639
in somebody's dryer before?

2653
03:09:10,399 --> 03:09:10,879
Not fun.

2654
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:14,739
I mean, I spelt real clean when I came up.

2655
03:09:14,739 --> 03:09:15,780
I'll be honest with you.

2656
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:18,129
Every so often, he would, it was weird,

2657
03:09:18,129 --> 03:09:19,329
because he would turn the dryer on.

2658
03:09:20,129 --> 03:09:22,690
I was in there for probably 12 hours at a time.

2659
03:09:23,489 --> 03:09:25,569
And he would turn the dryer on.

2660
03:09:25,569 --> 03:09:27,250
And I'd be fucking flipping around and shit.

2661
03:09:27,250 --> 03:09:28,530
He would throw a couple sheets in there.

2662
03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:31,569
And he'd be like, you smell pretty fresh, don't you?

2663
03:09:31,569 --> 03:09:33,649
And I'd be like, fuck, I guess I do.

2664
03:09:33,649 --> 03:09:35,010
He'd throw hamburger meat in there,

2665
03:09:35,010 --> 03:09:36,209
and the heat from the,

2666
03:09:37,569 --> 03:09:39,649
the heat from the dryer would actually cook it.

2667
03:09:39,649 --> 03:09:42,370
So I would have to wait probably maybe 20 or 30 minutes

2668
03:09:42,370 --> 03:09:44,290
for the raw hamburger meat to spin around with me

2669
03:09:44,290 --> 03:09:45,489
until it was cooked enough where I could eat it.

2670
03:09:45,489 --> 03:09:46,530
So I mean, he was nice enough.

2671
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:48,530
He like helped me out a little bit there.

2672
03:09:57,340 --> 03:09:58,379
Both sides there, yeah.

2673
03:09:59,760 --> 03:10:01,040
Same, oh, I didn't, whoops.

2674
03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:19,250
Fucked that up down here.

2675
03:10:20,530 --> 03:10:23,309
Who's my smash man?

2676
03:10:23,309 --> 03:10:23,870
It's Pac-Man.

2677
03:10:24,510 --> 03:10:32,420
I mean, I was going to say Gino, but whatever.

2678
03:10:33,059 --> 03:10:36,459
Life sucks, apparently, for Gino.

2679
03:10:37,180 --> 03:10:41,489
There we go.

2680
03:10:42,129 --> 03:10:44,909
This comes down.

2681
03:10:45,709 --> 03:10:48,479
Yeah, I was one of those people

2682
03:10:48,479 --> 03:10:50,479
that thought the Grinch leak was real.

2683
03:10:51,360 --> 03:10:53,489
And I was like, oh my god,

2684
03:10:53,489 --> 03:10:54,930
this is going to be the best game ever made.

2685
03:10:54,930 --> 03:10:56,129
And then you got to remember, it's,

2686
03:10:57,409 --> 03:10:58,690
everyone I was just trying to fuck with you

2687
03:10:58,690 --> 03:10:59,649
before a game comes out.

2688
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:00,930
Of course you did.

2689
03:11:00,930 --> 03:11:03,409
Well, I mean, it looked really, it looked so real.

2690
03:11:03,969 --> 03:11:05,409
There was so much backstory.

2691
03:11:05,969 --> 03:11:08,209
So much time went into somebody making that leak

2692
03:11:08,209 --> 03:11:10,690
that it was just like impossible for it to be fake.

2693
03:11:11,569 --> 03:11:12,450
And here we are.

2694
03:11:20,909 --> 03:11:25,069
Did I, same thing on this side too.

2695
03:11:32,059 --> 03:11:33,100
Smash characters.

2696
03:11:33,979 --> 03:11:37,420
Uh, no, but I mean, Pac-Man, it's always Pac-Man, right?

2697
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:39,260
Pac-Man is just always cool.

2698
03:11:41,979 --> 03:11:43,739
A couple of other characters look interesting.

2699
03:11:44,379 --> 03:11:46,159
I don't have to give spoilers or anything,

2700
03:11:46,159 --> 03:11:48,959
but there's a certain plant-based hero

2701
03:11:48,959 --> 03:11:50,639
that looks really stupid.

2702
03:11:51,520 --> 03:11:52,479
Kind of right up my alley.

2703
03:11:53,360 --> 03:12:01,629
Uh, okay, check the six little tabs

2704
03:12:01,629 --> 03:12:02,670
we popped into the openings.

2705
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:03,870
If they haven't all popped into place,

2706
03:12:03,870 --> 03:12:04,670
go back and fix them.

2707
03:12:05,709 --> 03:12:07,069
I mean, these, this looks right.

2708
03:12:09,219 --> 03:12:09,940
Just going to go like this.

2709
03:12:09,940 --> 03:12:15,229
And then we're going to get this piece.

2710
03:12:16,430 --> 03:12:21,280
Uh, it's going to be a shit character.

2711
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:27,069
Well, we'll see what they do for DLC.

2712
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:30,739
Because apparently, they already have a plan for DLC.

2713
03:12:30,739 --> 03:12:37,620
I guess still, who else is left to put in that game?

2714
03:12:37,620 --> 03:12:38,180
You know what I mean?

2715
03:12:39,139 --> 03:12:43,250
They have every single Nintendo character ever.

2716
03:12:43,250 --> 03:12:46,290
Has spirits and trophies and characters.

2717
03:12:46,290 --> 03:12:47,409
Like, what the fuck?

2718
03:12:47,409 --> 03:12:49,250
There's five more characters they want to put in.

2719
03:12:50,049 --> 03:12:58,860
Third party?

2720
03:13:00,190 --> 03:13:02,670
Yeah, I mean, I'd be nice if one of those

2721
03:13:02,670 --> 03:13:08,530
third party characters was, you know, Gino.

2722
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:11,149
Technically third party character.

2723
03:13:11,790 --> 03:13:17,840
Let's see here.

2724
03:13:17,840 --> 03:13:18,799
Carl Griffinstein.

2725
03:13:20,379 --> 03:13:21,819
If Nintendo ever hit me up to like,

2726
03:13:21,819 --> 03:13:23,500
pay for the rights of Carl Griffinstein.

2727
03:13:24,319 --> 03:13:25,920
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Albertson.

2728
03:13:25,920 --> 03:13:29,600
Yes, I'm writing this email to offer you a lump sum.

2729
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:32,559
I have a reply to the email as fast as I could.

2730
03:13:32,559 --> 03:13:33,760
I don't even care what the amount was.

2731
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:35,440
And I'd be like, yes, yes, yes.

2732
03:13:36,159 --> 03:13:39,360
They'd be like, take it, take it now, take it.

2733
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:41,569
How many bits is that?

2734
03:13:41,569 --> 03:13:42,450
How much is that in bits?

2735
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:53,840
One dollar would be worth it.

2736
03:13:53,840 --> 03:14:00,989
Am I putting this in the right way?

2737
03:14:00,989 --> 03:14:04,959
It's got a snap in there.

2738
03:14:10,899 --> 03:14:12,100
Paid you in potato chips.

2739
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:12,659
It'd be worth it.

2740
03:14:12,659 --> 03:14:46,340
I never have to buy them ever again.

2741
03:14:46,340 --> 03:14:47,059
Easy.

2742
03:14:47,059 --> 03:14:51,819
You should do a rumble of all the Smash characters.

2743
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:53,979
That's a lot.

2744
03:14:53,979 --> 03:14:54,860
That's a lot of characters.

2745
03:14:58,059 --> 03:14:59,100
Steering wheel has a seat.

2746
03:15:00,930 --> 03:15:03,409
So we need to move that down here because that's done.

2747
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:05,920
C and D again.

2748
03:15:11,010 --> 03:15:12,850
Everything else from all of it, the whole thing.

2749
03:15:13,409 --> 03:15:20,430
I lose it.

2750
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:21,149
Where did it just go?

2751
03:15:22,129 --> 03:15:22,770
Where did that go?

2752
03:15:23,870 --> 03:15:25,069
Oh, it's all the way down there.

2753
03:15:25,950 --> 03:15:43,229
And the two pieces down here.

2754
03:15:44,110 --> 03:15:47,520
How's the elaborate pie box going?

2755
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:48,879
Actually, it's going pretty well.

2756
03:15:49,680 --> 03:15:50,719
I think it's going pretty well.

2757
03:15:51,360 --> 03:15:52,079
What do you guys think?

2758
03:15:54,219 --> 03:15:56,059
You guys think it's going well so far?

2759
03:16:00,540 --> 03:16:02,139
A Labo stream without alcohol.

2760
03:16:02,139 --> 03:16:02,620
What kind?

2761
03:16:03,260 --> 03:16:03,899
Excuse me.

2762
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:54,420
You were saying something.

2763
03:16:56,260 --> 03:17:04,860
Show the box.

2764
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:05,739
I showed the box earlier.

2765
03:17:05,739 --> 03:17:06,540
It's black box.

2766
03:17:08,420 --> 03:17:09,540
That's pretty good.

2767
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:12,350
Is that sangria?

2768
03:17:12,350 --> 03:17:13,389
No, it's a red blend.

2769
03:17:13,389 --> 03:17:15,149
It's California red blend from black box.

2770
03:17:15,950 --> 03:17:18,030
Cheap, affordable, tastes great.

2771
03:17:18,909 --> 03:17:25,620
Why am I turning them all over?

2772
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:26,180
What are you doing?

2773
03:17:28,799 --> 03:17:29,760
And then we need something from D.

2774
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:35,819
The whole thing?

2775
03:17:35,819 --> 03:17:37,340
No, just this left part.

2776
03:17:46,909 --> 03:17:52,180
Oh, put a sponsor warning in the title.

2777
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,620
I'm not sponsored by black box.

2778
03:17:53,620 --> 03:17:54,899
I just bought it and like it.

2779
03:17:55,780 --> 03:17:56,260
That's it.

2780
03:17:56,979 --> 03:18:05,659
Do you really even have to like it?

2781
03:18:09,520 --> 03:18:10,559
Chill, chill.

2782
03:18:11,360 --> 03:18:15,600
What, like you guys don't drink wine

2783
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:17,520
if you're above the age of 21.

2784
03:18:18,239 --> 03:18:21,020
You never had wine before in your life

2785
03:18:21,020 --> 03:18:22,540
and you want a decent alternative

2786
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:25,420
to buying like a $50 bottle of wine

2787
03:18:25,420 --> 03:18:27,180
and it is three liters in here.

2788
03:18:28,379 --> 03:18:30,219
And it's quality wine.

2789
03:18:30,940 --> 03:18:41,489
A funny story here.

2790
03:18:42,129 --> 03:18:44,219
The guy that helps produce

2791
03:18:44,219 --> 03:18:45,500
a lot of the video stuff

2792
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:46,700
and the guy that helped me make

2793
03:18:46,700 --> 03:18:47,899
almost the whole rumble.

2794
03:18:49,579 --> 03:18:51,500
We bought this and we wrote

2795
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:53,020
the whole rumble drink

2796
03:18:53,020 --> 03:18:54,540
in the whole box of black box wine.

2797
03:18:55,579 --> 03:19:01,280
We also wrote four other skits

2798
03:19:01,280 --> 03:19:05,840
and ideas completely drinking this one.

2799
03:19:06,639 --> 03:19:07,680
So it's kind of like a little,

2800
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:10,479
it's my heart somewhere, you know.

2801
03:19:10,479 --> 03:19:21,729
It's funny juice.

2802
03:19:21,729 --> 03:19:22,370
Buy it up.

2803
03:19:23,920 --> 03:19:25,520
The bits circled in the picture below

2804
03:19:25,520 --> 03:19:26,719
shouldn't be folded.

2805
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:28,159
There's a reason they don't have fold lines.

2806
03:19:28,879 --> 03:19:29,840
All right.

2807
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:30,559
I didn't fold them.

2808
03:19:31,280 --> 03:19:32,000
Maybe I did.

2809
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:32,479
What, what?

2810
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:35,920
Okay.

2811
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:37,360
Well, I got apparently I do fold.

2812
03:19:48,180 --> 03:19:49,379
I once, honey chain says

2813
03:19:49,379 --> 03:19:51,299
I once drank an entire bottle of wine

2814
03:19:51,299 --> 03:19:52,579
and puked all over my friend's porch

2815
03:19:52,579 --> 03:19:54,340
and then he power bombed me through the sink.

2816
03:19:55,790 --> 03:19:56,989
Well, I believe the first half

2817
03:19:56,989 --> 03:19:58,350
but the second half was sensationalized

2818
03:19:58,350 --> 03:19:59,389
to make it seem like it was like,

2819
03:19:59,389 --> 03:20:00,909
wow, it's crazy.

2820
03:20:00,909 --> 03:20:02,030
I don't think the second part happened.

2821
03:20:02,030 --> 03:20:03,469
Yeah, I think you puked on your friend's sink in you.

2822
03:20:04,430 --> 03:20:08,350
Um, you know, you're trying to sensationalize

2823
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:21,819
a little bit because you called him out.

2824
03:20:21,819 --> 03:20:25,729
I believe him.

2825
03:20:25,729 --> 03:20:27,569
You're the only one that's allowed to make things up.

2826
03:20:27,569 --> 03:20:28,450
I'm the only one that's allowed

2827
03:20:28,450 --> 03:20:30,450
to lie and make things up here.

2828
03:20:30,450 --> 03:20:31,250
Don't you understand?

2829
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:45,020
One dollar.

2830
03:20:45,020 --> 03:20:46,620
You sound presidential.

2831
03:20:48,219 --> 03:20:48,940
Oh, fuck.

2832
03:20:50,350 --> 03:20:51,149
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2833
03:20:53,950 --> 03:20:54,930
Move on.

2834
03:20:55,489 --> 03:21:04,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2835
03:21:04,450 --> 03:21:06,719
Thank you.

2836
03:21:06,719 --> 03:21:10,209
Hey, hey, okay.

2837
03:21:10,209 --> 03:21:10,690
We're good.

2838
03:21:10,690 --> 03:21:17,819
Let's fold it down.

2839
03:21:17,819 --> 03:21:18,139
I did.

2840
03:21:18,700 --> 03:21:19,420
This one too.

2841
03:21:19,420 --> 03:21:19,920
I did.

2842
03:21:25,760 --> 03:21:27,040
I just heard my dog bark at me.

2843
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:29,780
Otto just said like, hey, shut the fuck up.

2844
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:30,819
He's like downstairs.

2845
03:21:32,370 --> 03:21:34,290
These both, these all come down.

2846
03:21:34,290 --> 03:21:35,329
Those come all the way down.

2847
03:21:35,329 --> 03:21:36,209
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

2848
03:21:36,209 --> 03:21:37,010
These tabs come up.

2849
03:21:37,969 --> 03:21:50,370
Like this, like that, like that.

2850
03:21:52,020 --> 03:21:52,520
Sick.

2851
03:21:55,299 --> 03:21:56,739
That square is not going anywhere.

2852
03:21:56,739 --> 03:21:58,180
Next, roll up the first loopy,

2853
03:21:58,180 --> 03:21:59,540
rectangular bit so that the tab

2854
03:21:59,540 --> 03:22:00,899
comes down to the rest of the room.

2855
03:22:14,579 --> 03:22:16,100
It's not in there really securely though.

2856
03:22:16,739 --> 03:22:17,860
You know what I mean?

2857
03:22:17,860 --> 03:22:18,360
Like, fuck.

2858
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:20,819
You demand a ho-ho.

2859
03:22:21,700 --> 03:22:22,979
So eat a ho-ho.

2860
03:22:22,979 --> 03:22:23,860
Go to a convenience store

2861
03:22:23,860 --> 03:22:25,940
and get a fucking, get a Yahoo,

2862
03:22:25,940 --> 03:22:26,579
whatever they're called.

2863
03:22:28,299 --> 03:22:29,420
The tab's poking out.

2864
03:22:30,459 --> 03:22:32,299
This one is not, but that one is.

2865
03:22:32,860 --> 03:22:33,739
Okay, they both now.

2866
03:22:41,729 --> 03:22:42,370
No, that's fine.

2867
03:22:45,649 --> 03:22:46,450
Folds over.

2868
03:22:47,569 --> 03:22:50,209
So they back up again.

2869
03:22:50,209 --> 03:22:51,329
And all this flipping making me dizzy.

2870
03:22:51,329 --> 03:22:52,610
Now roll the piece up from left

2871
03:22:52,610 --> 03:22:53,569
until it looks like this.

2872
03:22:54,450 --> 03:22:57,780
So that comes up and then that comes over.

2873
03:22:59,309 --> 03:23:00,909
And then the whole, that comes down.

2874
03:23:08,500 --> 03:23:09,000
Shit.

2875
03:23:10,709 --> 03:23:12,870
That, this, this way.

2876
03:23:13,909 --> 03:23:16,790
And then this tab comes down into there.

2877
03:23:18,389 --> 03:23:22,159
Oh, you little punk.

2878
03:23:22,159 --> 03:23:22,659
Come on.

2879
03:23:30,129 --> 03:23:32,799
Done.

2880
03:23:32,799 --> 03:23:35,280
Remember, the bits weren't supposed to fold.

2881
03:23:35,280 --> 03:23:36,159
Check that all four of them

2882
03:23:36,159 --> 03:23:37,360
are still nice and straight.

2883
03:23:37,360 --> 03:23:37,860
They are.

2884
03:23:38,479 --> 03:23:40,040
They are.

2885
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:40,600
They are.

2886
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:41,559
They are.

2887
03:23:41,559 --> 03:23:49,120
They are.

2888
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:49,680
Yeah, that's right.

2889
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:53,200
This one's a little fucked up.

2890
03:23:53,200 --> 03:23:56,049
No, that's fine.

2891
03:23:57,409 --> 03:23:57,909
Okay.

2892
03:23:58,690 --> 03:24:00,129
Uvey the steering column.

2893
03:24:00,770 --> 03:24:02,790
Next, we'll attach the steering wheel

2894
03:24:02,790 --> 03:24:03,430
to the steering column.

2895
03:24:03,430 --> 03:24:04,870
Make sure you've got the wheel close.

2896
03:24:05,590 --> 03:24:06,090
I do.

2897
03:24:07,250 --> 03:24:07,569
I do.

2898
03:24:07,569 --> 03:24:08,129
It's right here.

2899
03:24:15,139 --> 03:24:16,899
Fold the two colored flaps

2900
03:24:16,899 --> 03:24:18,579
in the middle of the steering wheel down

2901
03:24:18,579 --> 03:24:19,299
and out of the way.

2902
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:22,120
We'll be inserting the steering wheel

2903
03:24:22,120 --> 03:24:22,840
column from above.

2904
03:24:28,079 --> 03:24:29,120
Here comes the column.

2905
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:31,040
Straight down like this.

2906
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:38,040
Before you insert the steering wheel column,

2907
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:39,159
make sure it's facing the same way

2908
03:24:39,159 --> 03:24:39,879
as on the screen.

2909
03:24:39,879 --> 03:24:41,959
The printed bits on each side should match up.

2910
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:43,989
Good deal.

2911
03:24:43,989 --> 03:24:45,649
All the way down.

2912
03:24:46,370 --> 03:25:02,020
We did it.

2913
03:25:02,020 --> 03:25:02,659
All right.

2914
03:25:02,659 --> 03:25:05,030
Steering wheel and steering column are done.

2915
03:25:05,030 --> 03:25:05,430
Beautiful.

2916
03:25:05,430 --> 03:25:05,829
It's done.

2917
03:25:05,829 --> 03:25:06,629
The steering wheel is done.

2918
03:25:08,559 --> 03:25:10,159
Now, fit these two parts together.

2919
03:25:16,069 --> 03:25:17,750
So, lift the steering wheel part up

2920
03:25:17,750 --> 03:25:18,790
and insert down to the base.

2921
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:22,610
Well, it just sits down in there.

2922
03:25:22,610 --> 03:25:23,170
And that's it.

2923
03:25:23,809 --> 03:25:25,030
What have you done?

2924
03:25:25,750 --> 03:25:26,309
Okay.

2925
03:25:26,309 --> 03:25:29,569
So, just go down like that.

2926
03:25:37,329 --> 03:25:37,649
There.

2927
03:25:38,209 --> 03:25:39,170
That almost felt like winning

2928
03:25:39,170 --> 03:25:40,530
the crane game at an arcade.

2929
03:25:40,530 --> 03:25:41,969
Where's our stuffed animal prize?

2930
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:46,399
Now, we're going to turn

2931
03:25:46,399 --> 03:25:47,520
the whole thing over.

2932
03:25:48,479 --> 03:25:50,850
The bits aren't all fixed together yet,

2933
03:25:50,850 --> 03:25:52,129
so hold everything carefully

2934
03:25:52,129 --> 03:25:53,010
to keep it in place.

2935
03:25:56,069 --> 03:25:57,030
Turn it upside down.

2936
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:01,840
Here.

2937
03:26:01,840 --> 03:26:02,159
Okay.

2938
03:26:05,030 --> 03:26:07,590
This here piece is called Captain Crunch.

2939
03:26:07,590 --> 03:26:08,709
Captain Captain.

2940
03:26:09,350 --> 03:26:10,930
He caps the steering column,

2941
03:26:10,930 --> 03:26:13,969
then turns to keep it securely in place.

2942
03:26:18,530 --> 03:26:19,489
What the fuck are you talking about?

2943
03:26:27,729 --> 03:26:27,969
All right.

2944
03:26:27,969 --> 03:26:28,690
Then that goes.

2945
03:26:29,409 --> 03:26:34,239
Spin the captain around

2946
03:26:34,239 --> 03:26:35,360
so that his two dents are facing

2947
03:26:35,360 --> 03:26:36,079
as shown on screen.

2948
03:26:36,079 --> 03:26:37,280
Then slide him down

2949
03:26:37,280 --> 03:26:38,479
on the end of the steering column.

2950
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:41,200
So, like this.

2951
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:55,079
Ahoy there, land lovers.

2952
03:26:55,079 --> 03:26:56,120
This is the captain speaking.

2953
03:26:56,120 --> 03:26:57,319
You'll want to hold...

2954
03:26:57,399 --> 03:26:58,280
Why is this Garfield?

2955
03:26:59,079 --> 03:27:00,370
Anybody feel like this is

2956
03:27:00,370 --> 03:27:01,329
like Garfield's bits?

2957
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:03,639
I feel like we're hitting it

2958
03:27:03,639 --> 03:27:04,840
at Garfield's bits.

2959
03:27:05,479 --> 03:27:06,520
Ahoy there, land lovers.

2960
03:27:06,520 --> 03:27:07,719
This is the captain speaking.

2961
03:27:07,719 --> 03:27:09,399
You'll want to hold that wheel

2962
03:27:09,399 --> 03:27:11,639
nice and steady when you turn me around.

2963
03:27:11,639 --> 03:27:17,889
What do you want?

2964
03:27:17,889 --> 03:27:20,370
Around I go till the cross lines up.

2965
03:27:21,090 --> 03:27:30,520
Like this.

2966
03:27:31,319 --> 03:27:39,969
Like that.

2967
03:27:40,530 --> 03:27:44,549
That's it, right?

2968
03:27:45,110 --> 03:27:52,370
They don't call me captain for nothing.

2969
03:27:52,370 --> 03:27:53,329
You know, I wish I was part

2970
03:27:53,329 --> 03:27:54,450
of the Toy-Con submarine,

2971
03:27:54,450 --> 03:27:55,969
but a cardboard can dream.

2972
03:27:55,969 --> 03:27:56,450
This is...

2973
03:27:56,450 --> 03:27:57,489
Scarfield wrote all this.

2974
03:27:58,290 --> 03:27:59,010
I'm convinced.

2975
03:28:05,299 --> 03:28:07,299
Captain Capturn has four mates on deck.

2976
03:28:07,299 --> 03:28:10,100
They're called quadruple lock quadruplets.

2977
03:28:10,100 --> 03:28:11,700
They help keep the captain in his place.

2978
03:28:12,659 --> 03:28:14,420
So, flip them all around

2979
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:15,299
and fold them all in half.

2980
03:28:15,940 --> 03:28:30,340
The one time Garfield's not here.

2981
03:28:30,340 --> 03:28:31,299
That's unfortunate.

2982
03:28:31,940 --> 03:28:33,360
Everybody loves Garfield.

2983
03:28:34,079 --> 03:28:35,760
All right, so stick them in half.

2984
03:28:35,760 --> 03:28:36,479
Flip them in there

2985
03:28:36,479 --> 03:28:37,440
and stick them in the slots.

2986
03:28:38,239 --> 03:28:47,170
First mate reporting for duty.

2987
03:28:47,170 --> 03:28:48,129
My siblings and I were destined

2988
03:28:48,129 --> 03:28:49,250
to do everything together.

2989
03:28:49,250 --> 03:28:50,209
Quadruplet power!

2990
03:28:50,930 --> 03:28:54,290
Slide the first mate down from above

2991
03:28:54,290 --> 03:28:55,170
and lock her in.

2992
03:28:55,170 --> 03:28:56,290
That's the first lock down.

2993
03:28:57,090 --> 03:29:10,100
That's it.

2994
03:29:10,100 --> 03:29:12,420
Do that to all four sides.

2995
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:13,139
Right?

2996
03:29:13,139 --> 03:29:13,940
Yeah.

2997
03:29:13,940 --> 03:29:14,979
I'm not reading this.

2998
03:29:16,340 --> 03:29:17,139
Nice messages.

2999
03:29:17,780 --> 03:29:18,579
Uh, fourth mate.

3000
03:29:18,579 --> 03:29:19,620
They may spell, but they're together.

3001
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:21,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3002
03:29:21,059 --> 03:29:21,780
Okay.

3003
03:29:21,780 --> 03:29:29,649
Just that one.

3004
03:29:29,649 --> 03:29:35,799
Okay, one more.

3005
03:29:40,479 --> 03:29:41,920
So that is locked in.

3006
03:29:42,639 --> 03:29:45,959
You're missing out on labo lore?

3007
03:29:45,959 --> 03:29:48,120
Do you really care about labo lore?

3008
03:29:48,120 --> 03:29:49,000
You want me to go back?

3009
03:29:49,799 --> 03:29:50,819
I ain't going back.

3010
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:54,799
Get ready to use these two stubby

3011
03:29:54,799 --> 03:29:55,680
T-shaped pieces.

3012
03:29:55,680 --> 03:29:56,959
They look a bit like sweaters.

3013
03:29:57,680 --> 03:29:58,399
I only have one.

3014
03:29:58,959 --> 03:30:00,930
Why do I only have one?

3015
03:30:00,930 --> 03:30:03,649
No, I don't.

3016
03:30:03,649 --> 03:30:03,889
Why?

3017
03:30:04,450 --> 03:30:05,139
All right.

3018
03:30:05,139 --> 03:30:06,100
Flip them up.

3019
03:30:06,100 --> 03:30:06,739
Spin them around.

3020
03:30:07,379 --> 03:30:19,139
Okay.

3021
03:30:21,299 --> 03:30:23,059
Uh, let's attach the first sweater.

3022
03:30:23,059 --> 03:30:24,180
Fold the arms so that they're ready

3023
03:30:24,180 --> 03:30:25,620
for a hug and then slide them into

3024
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:26,899
the openings in the steering wheel.

3025
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:34,229
That goes back around.

3026
03:30:34,229 --> 03:30:40,360
You fucking idiot.

3027
03:30:40,360 --> 03:30:40,920
All right.

3028
03:30:40,920 --> 03:30:41,319
Right there.

3029
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:50,309
Like this.

3030
03:30:51,030 --> 03:30:51,350
Yes.

3031
03:30:51,909 --> 03:30:59,059
This is, you need like little hands

3032
03:30:59,059 --> 03:30:59,860
for this.

3033
03:30:59,860 --> 03:31:03,989
It's in.

3034
03:31:06,879 --> 03:31:07,360
Right?

3035
03:31:07,360 --> 03:31:07,840
Looks good.

3036
03:31:08,479 --> 03:31:16,159
Time for a second sweater.

3037
03:31:16,159 --> 03:31:16,959
It gives the steering wheel

3038
03:31:16,959 --> 03:31:17,920
a hug from the other side.

3039
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:19,120
It's a steering wheel sandwich

3040
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:20,159
on a sweater bread.

3041
03:31:20,159 --> 03:31:20,719
Garfield.

3042
03:31:22,260 --> 03:31:22,739
Excuse me?

3043
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:24,659
Did you hear the dog?

3044
03:31:25,219 --> 03:31:25,940
I'll go get him.

3045
03:31:26,739 --> 03:31:32,549
I'm gonna go get my dog

3046
03:31:33,270 --> 03:31:34,309
because he's probably being

3047
03:31:34,309 --> 03:31:35,430
really annoying.

3048
03:31:35,430 --> 03:31:36,950
He's probably being super annoying.

3049
03:31:37,909 --> 03:31:40,530
Wait, how does this get in there?

3050
03:31:52,680 --> 03:31:53,719
Auto is never annoying.

3051
03:31:53,719 --> 03:31:54,360
No, I'm just kidding.

3052
03:31:55,079 --> 03:31:56,819
He's my special little boy.

3053
03:31:57,540 --> 03:31:58,180
So that's done.

3054
03:31:58,899 --> 03:32:01,459
It's in.

3055
03:32:01,459 --> 03:32:02,020
Secure.

3056
03:32:02,979 --> 03:32:03,860
The steering part is now

3057
03:32:03,860 --> 03:32:06,260
completely secured to the base.

3058
03:32:06,260 --> 03:32:07,139
Let's check to make sure

3059
03:32:07,139 --> 03:32:08,420
that everything moves like it should.

3060
03:32:09,139 --> 03:32:12,120
This is where the Toy-Con key comes in.

3061
03:32:12,920 --> 03:32:14,159
Oh, what do we have here?

3062
03:32:14,159 --> 03:32:14,719
There's a hole.

3063
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:15,520
That's the perfect size

3064
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:16,399
for the Toy-Con key

3065
03:32:16,399 --> 03:32:17,520
to slide right through.

3066
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:23,190
I'm not gonna need the mode

3067
03:32:23,190 --> 03:32:23,829
in there right now.

3068
03:32:24,389 --> 03:32:36,600
So this goes like this.

3069
03:32:42,399 --> 03:32:42,719
Perfect.

3070
03:32:43,969 --> 03:32:44,530
Yes, it does.

3071
03:32:45,329 --> 03:32:49,360
Try spinning the steering wheel

3072
03:32:49,360 --> 03:32:49,760
around slowly.

3073
03:32:49,760 --> 03:32:50,639
Does it go all the way around

3074
03:32:50,639 --> 03:32:51,760
without stopping or catching?

3075
03:32:59,280 --> 03:32:59,840
Yes, it does.

3076
03:33:00,479 --> 03:33:06,069
Once you're done checking

3077
03:33:06,069 --> 03:33:06,870
the steering wheel,

3078
03:33:07,590 --> 03:33:10,209
remove the Toy-Con key for now.

3079
03:33:10,209 --> 03:33:11,729
It might get caught a bit the first time.

3080
03:33:11,729 --> 03:33:13,569
So make sure you remove it carefully.

3081
03:33:13,569 --> 03:33:14,049
I got it.

3082
03:33:15,649 --> 03:33:16,610
Somebody said other way.

3083
03:33:17,489 --> 03:33:19,190
Yeah, that's good.

3084
03:33:19,909 --> 03:33:20,819
It works.

3085
03:33:21,459 --> 03:33:23,510
All right, on to the next step.

3086
03:33:23,510 --> 03:33:25,030
The steering wheel base is finished.

3087
03:33:25,030 --> 03:33:26,149
The steering wheel is complete.

3088
03:33:27,030 --> 03:33:28,920
This would be a great time for a break.

3089
03:33:29,479 --> 03:33:30,520
They don't take breaks.

3090
03:33:30,520 --> 03:33:32,770
Here, three of seven.

3091
03:33:32,770 --> 03:33:34,209
Making the engine compartment.

3092
03:33:39,159 --> 03:33:40,600
I need to move this out of the way.

3093
03:33:40,600 --> 03:33:41,639
Don't take any more breaks.

3094
03:33:41,639 --> 03:33:42,440
Tell you this.

3095
03:33:43,399 --> 03:33:58,930
Auto, one second.

3096
03:34:02,500 --> 03:34:34,520
You have to be somewhere

3097
03:34:34,520 --> 03:34:35,639
that's not right in the way.

3098
03:34:37,959 --> 03:34:38,200
Okay.

3099
03:34:39,079 --> 03:34:42,610
See, he just want to be in here.

3100
03:34:42,610 --> 03:34:43,010
He's good.

3101
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:46,360
He's currently like back there

3102
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:47,079
where the door is.

3103
03:34:47,879 --> 03:34:52,209
All right, so we got this.

3104
03:34:52,209 --> 03:34:53,170
I have it already.

3105
03:34:53,170 --> 03:34:53,569
We're good.

3106
03:34:54,530 --> 03:34:57,510
Make sure you get the special parts.

3107
03:34:58,309 --> 03:34:59,479
All right, I'm going to eat.

3108
03:35:01,479 --> 03:35:05,250
I thought we were going to lie in the blanket.

3109
03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:06,129
What a good dog.

3110
03:35:10,559 --> 03:35:11,520
Huge piece.

3111
03:35:11,520 --> 03:35:12,399
Do I need the whole thing?

3112
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:14,479
Almost the whole thing.

3113
03:35:17,440 --> 03:35:18,719
Jesus, this is huge.

3114
03:35:19,760 --> 03:35:22,950
This looks like somebody's rib cage.

3115
03:35:23,909 --> 03:35:25,670
It's like a Minecraft breastplate.

3116
03:35:26,549 --> 03:35:31,120
Should I wear this?

3117
03:35:32,959 --> 03:35:33,760
I'm going to need this later.

3118
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:38,040
So, okay.

3119
03:35:39,569 --> 03:35:40,370
Show auto.

3120
03:35:42,639 --> 03:35:45,120
The cameras are like set in such specific.

3121
03:35:45,840 --> 03:35:47,280
Can you see him?

3122
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:48,719
He's right there.

3123
03:35:49,360 --> 03:35:51,190
See, right here.

3124
03:35:51,190 --> 03:35:51,690
Auto.

3125
03:35:52,229 --> 03:35:53,590
Hello, Auto.

3126
03:35:54,149 --> 03:35:56,229
Hello, Mr. Auto.

3127
03:36:01,030 --> 03:36:01,909
There, he's right there.

3128
03:36:02,870 --> 03:36:04,879
All right, so let me take out

3129
03:36:04,879 --> 03:36:06,799
the little pieces that I need to punch out.

3130
03:36:07,360 --> 03:36:11,270
We'll continue on our vehicle quest.

3131
03:36:12,149 --> 03:36:13,959
I ripped it a little bit.

3132
03:36:13,959 --> 03:36:14,440
You know what?

3133
03:36:15,159 --> 03:36:15,639
Who cares?

3134
03:36:16,200 --> 03:36:19,040
Uh, that's it.

3135
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:19,600
No, up here.

3136
03:36:20,319 --> 03:36:24,709
Pet him.

3137
03:36:26,149 --> 03:36:27,040
Where is he going?

3138
03:36:36,239 --> 03:36:40,530
He's under the blanket.

3139
03:36:40,530 --> 03:36:41,250
There's a little blade.

3140
03:36:41,250 --> 03:36:43,010
He just like stuffed his body underneath it.

3141
03:36:43,809 --> 03:36:47,200
Mr. Auto.

3142
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:51,590
He's such a good dog.

3143
03:36:52,069 --> 03:36:53,350
He's the best dog ever.

3144
03:36:53,350 --> 03:36:55,510
All right, so let's do this.

3145
03:36:55,670 --> 03:36:56,229
Out of the way.

3146
03:36:57,840 --> 03:37:00,319
Uh, six, seven, eight, nine.

3147
03:37:00,319 --> 03:37:02,319
It's like 10 o'clock Eastern.

3148
03:37:02,319 --> 03:37:03,040
What day is it?

3149
03:37:07,760 --> 03:37:08,159
Saturday.

3150
03:37:08,159 --> 03:37:08,879
It's Saturday night.

3151
03:37:09,680 --> 03:37:10,239
We're good.

3152
03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:11,120
It's not even 10 o'clock.

3153
03:37:12,629 --> 03:37:16,229
All right, so get it out there.

3154
03:37:16,870 --> 03:37:18,389
The engine compartment comes from it.

3155
03:37:19,110 --> 03:37:19,840
What's wrong with me?

3156
03:37:21,620 --> 03:37:23,219
Okay, it doesn't really have an engine on it,

3157
03:37:23,219 --> 03:37:24,100
but it's fun to pretend.

3158
03:37:28,020 --> 03:37:28,420
Folds.

3159
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:35,059
Pretty much all of them.

3160
03:37:35,059 --> 03:37:38,760
All the ones in the top.

3161
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:39,559
All the ones in the middle.

3162
03:37:40,440 --> 03:37:41,559
Every single little piece.

3163
03:37:41,559 --> 03:37:42,520
All of it has to be folded.

3164
03:37:46,020 --> 03:37:46,819
Every single piece.

3165
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:49,760
Okay, let's begin.

3166
03:37:50,719 --> 03:37:58,260
What kind of dog is Auto?

3167
03:37:58,260 --> 03:37:59,379
He's a Dachshund mix.

3168
03:38:00,500 --> 03:38:03,299
I don't know what he's mixed with,

3169
03:38:04,479 --> 03:38:06,559
but there's been plenty of guesses over the years.

3170
03:38:07,600 --> 03:38:10,079
Chihuahua, Beagle, Rottweiler,

3171
03:38:10,079 --> 03:38:11,200
Jack Russell Terrier.

3172
03:38:12,079 --> 03:38:13,440
Don't know because he's a rescue,

3173
03:38:13,440 --> 03:38:14,399
so I don't really know.

3174
03:38:14,399 --> 03:38:15,040
I have no idea.

3175
03:38:16,159 --> 03:38:17,120
There's been plenty of guesses.

3176
03:38:21,190 --> 03:38:22,149
He's a tiny boy.

3177
03:38:22,790 --> 03:38:24,229
He's actually kind of big

3178
03:38:24,229 --> 03:38:25,110
for a Dachshund,

3179
03:38:25,750 --> 03:38:30,309
but he is a very good dog.

3180
03:38:30,870 --> 03:38:35,329
It's an old classic German question.

3181
03:38:36,739 --> 03:38:37,780
What kind of dog do you have?

3182
03:38:39,170 --> 03:38:41,569
Yeah, I mean he's, I don't know.

3183
03:38:41,569 --> 03:38:43,569
Thought about doing one of those doggie DNA tests,

3184
03:38:43,569 --> 03:38:45,569
but I've read a lot of things

3185
03:38:45,569 --> 03:38:47,329
about how those things are bullshit

3186
03:38:47,329 --> 03:38:50,129
and they just send you back a random DNA test

3187
03:38:50,129 --> 03:38:51,329
that doesn't even mean anything.

3188
03:38:51,969 --> 03:38:53,090
I don't know how true that is.

3189
03:38:57,409 --> 03:38:57,969
Might be true.

3190
03:38:57,969 --> 03:38:58,610
It might not be.

3191
03:39:04,770 --> 03:39:05,649
Ooh, that felt good.

3192
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:11,719
Do your own DNA test.

3193
03:39:19,219 --> 03:39:23,040
What?

3194
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:24,399
12% ferret.

3195
03:39:25,569 --> 03:39:26,770
You might have some ferret in them.

3196
03:39:32,389 --> 03:39:34,549
Old, bold, right in the middle.

3197
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:40,879
We got one, I think I see two here.

3198
03:39:42,399 --> 03:39:49,409
One, two, one, two.

3199
03:39:52,280 --> 03:39:54,280
Your dog is a purebred rat.

3200
03:39:55,639 --> 03:39:57,319
Well, then I'm sorry to tell you this,

3201
03:39:57,319 --> 03:39:58,600
but he's not a dog.

3202
03:40:00,040 --> 03:40:01,479
Your dog is a rat.

3203
03:40:02,680 --> 03:40:03,639
It's not a dog.

3204
03:40:04,120 --> 03:40:12,520
That's good.

3205
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:20,600
Mess over here.

3206
03:40:22,659 --> 03:40:26,959
All right, so done, done.

3207
03:40:27,680 --> 03:40:28,479
One more piece.

3208
03:40:28,479 --> 03:40:31,520
So many little pieces in this big boy here.

3209
03:40:37,440 --> 03:40:38,639
Ever thought of getting a pet rat?

3210
03:40:38,639 --> 03:40:39,520
I have over the years.

3211
03:40:40,319 --> 03:40:42,370
My one issue with the pet rat is

3212
03:40:43,809 --> 03:40:44,530
they're wonderful,

3213
03:40:44,530 --> 03:40:45,409
they're really intelligent,

3214
03:40:45,409 --> 03:40:46,129
they're super sweet,

3215
03:40:46,129 --> 03:40:46,930
they're really fun,

3216
03:40:46,930 --> 03:40:47,649
they're really smart,

3217
03:40:49,319 --> 03:40:52,770
but man, they really only live like a year.

3218
03:40:52,770 --> 03:40:53,809
They live like two years.

3219
03:40:55,010 --> 03:40:57,010
I get so attached to any animal

3220
03:40:57,010 --> 03:40:57,729
that I ever have.

3221
03:40:58,370 --> 03:40:59,489
They used to have hamsters

3222
03:40:59,489 --> 03:41:00,850
and gerbils and all that shit,

3223
03:41:00,850 --> 03:41:03,809
and it was so tough after fucking a year.

3224
03:41:07,860 --> 03:41:08,979
A year and a half would go by,

3225
03:41:08,979 --> 03:41:09,700
and it was like right

3226
03:41:09,700 --> 03:41:11,299
when you're beginning to start a relationship

3227
03:41:11,299 --> 03:41:14,340
and like, oh, this is my animal, my pet.

3228
03:41:15,059 --> 03:41:15,940
It just sucks,

3229
03:41:16,899 --> 03:41:18,100
but they are really good pets.

3230
03:41:18,100 --> 03:41:19,459
They're really fun to be around.

3231
03:41:19,459 --> 03:41:21,219
They're really energetic.

3232
03:41:21,219 --> 03:41:21,940
They're really funny,

3233
03:41:22,739 --> 03:41:26,559
but just unfortunately they don't live very long.

3234
03:41:27,840 --> 03:41:30,389
Didn't get this piece.

3235
03:41:32,319 --> 03:41:33,120
So all the way up.

3236
03:41:34,290 --> 03:41:35,010
All the way up.

3237
03:41:35,010 --> 03:41:35,489
There we go.

3238
03:41:39,030 --> 03:41:40,469
So pull this in.

3239
03:41:40,469 --> 03:41:42,469
This big piece comes up and goes in here.

3240
03:41:43,270 --> 03:41:44,360
I can handle it.

3241
03:41:45,079 --> 03:42:12,360
God damn it,

3242
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:14,680
he actually jebaited the labo stream.

3243
03:42:17,139 --> 03:42:18,180
Yes, I did.

3244
03:42:18,180 --> 03:42:18,819
I did.

3245
03:42:18,819 --> 03:42:20,500
You're right.

3246
03:42:20,500 --> 03:42:21,219
I did do that.

3247
03:42:25,319 --> 03:42:25,879
All right, we need,

3248
03:42:28,309 --> 03:42:29,829
it's time to introduce the eyelet.

3249
03:42:29,829 --> 03:42:30,790
It's got two parts.

3250
03:42:30,790 --> 03:42:32,069
The bit on the left is the grubbit

3251
03:42:32,069 --> 03:42:32,629
and the washer.

3252
03:42:32,629 --> 03:42:34,149
So how many of these do we have?

3253
03:42:34,149 --> 03:42:35,030
Do we need one or two?

3254
03:42:35,030 --> 03:42:35,670
How many do we need?

3255
03:42:36,709 --> 03:42:38,549
Take one of the gray eyelets from the bag.

3256
03:42:48,790 --> 03:42:49,350
Get over.

3257
03:42:49,350 --> 03:42:49,829
Get over.

3258
03:42:49,829 --> 03:42:50,309
Get over.

3259
03:42:50,309 --> 03:42:50,790
Get over.

3260
03:42:50,790 --> 03:42:51,190
Get over.

3261
03:42:51,989 --> 03:42:59,319
I don't want to take everything out.

3262
03:42:59,319 --> 03:43:01,159
Give me a grommet.

3263
03:43:01,159 --> 03:43:03,799
Give me a grommet.

3264
03:43:03,799 --> 03:43:05,680
Give me a grommet.

3265
03:43:05,680 --> 03:43:16,389
We forgot the crackers.

3266
03:43:17,190 --> 03:43:20,420
What do you mean?

3267
03:43:20,420 --> 03:43:21,139
What crackers?

3268
03:43:21,700 --> 03:43:23,479
What the heck do you mean, man?

3269
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:25,250
What the fuck do you mean?

3270
03:43:25,889 --> 03:43:26,290
All right.

3271
03:43:26,290 --> 03:43:27,489
Oh, take the grommet

3272
03:43:27,489 --> 03:43:29,170
and push it into the hole from the outside.

3273
03:43:30,209 --> 03:43:32,770
So on the back of our easy bake oven,

3274
03:43:32,770 --> 03:43:33,489
this thing here.

3275
03:43:34,049 --> 03:43:35,250
So it goes through here.

3276
03:43:36,129 --> 03:43:48,450
So this snaps on through here.

3277
03:43:49,090 --> 03:43:50,549
Yes, it does.

3278
03:43:51,750 --> 03:43:52,790
That's the way it goes, right?

3279
03:43:59,040 --> 03:44:00,879
Snap the washer onto the grommet from the inside

3280
03:44:00,879 --> 03:44:01,760
and it'll make a snap.

3281
03:44:02,959 --> 03:44:06,479
Tell me if you hear it.

3282
03:44:07,200 --> 03:44:26,200
Nice.

3283
03:44:26,200 --> 03:44:26,600
Okay, good.

3284
03:44:30,579 --> 03:44:31,540
We need an adult.

3285
03:44:32,180 --> 03:44:35,299
What's the point of that?

3286
03:44:35,299 --> 03:44:47,760
Okay.

3287
03:44:51,920 --> 03:44:52,399
Sheet F.

3288
03:44:53,280 --> 03:45:03,670
Just as good as the first set.

3289
03:45:11,809 --> 03:45:13,250
All of it except for the bottom part.

3290
03:45:14,049 --> 03:45:15,840
You guys having a good time?

3291
03:45:15,840 --> 03:45:16,399
You having fun?

3292
03:45:17,680 --> 03:45:20,209
You guys having fun?

3293
03:45:20,209 --> 03:45:29,559
I'm seeing some nose here.

3294
03:45:30,120 --> 03:45:33,620
I'm seeing some nose here.

3295
03:45:33,620 --> 03:45:35,379
I'm gonna have to eat paint on stream.

3296
03:45:35,379 --> 03:45:35,940
You know what I mean?

3297
03:45:35,940 --> 03:45:36,899
Like I'm seeing some nose.

3298
03:45:37,860 --> 03:45:44,790
What do I do with this?

3299
03:45:44,790 --> 03:45:47,270
What do I do with my fucking airline puke box?

3300
03:45:47,989 --> 03:45:51,409
I'm running out of space.

3301
03:45:52,129 --> 03:45:55,989
Don't turn this piece.

3302
03:45:55,989 --> 03:45:57,350
Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.

3303
03:45:58,069 --> 03:46:01,680
Fold these flops first.

3304
03:46:02,399 --> 03:46:14,399
Go say hello to italics.

3305
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:16,469
Just tell me if you can hear this on his stream.

3306
03:46:52,399 --> 03:46:57,750
Did you hear me?

3307
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:05,600
He has like the sweetest face right now.

3308
03:47:05,600 --> 03:47:06,319
I have to show him.

3309
03:47:20,930 --> 03:47:21,969
You see here or no you can't?

3310
03:47:22,610 --> 03:47:28,930
Move camera.

3311
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:30,129
I can't move the camera.

3312
03:47:30,129 --> 03:47:31,809
It's like in the worst possible one.

3313
03:47:31,809 --> 03:47:32,450
Maybe I can.

3314
03:47:36,879 --> 03:47:47,459
Hey, what are you doing?

3315
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:57,000
He's so cute.

3316
03:48:05,760 --> 03:48:07,040
He's my special boy.

3317
03:48:10,579 --> 03:48:11,780
You guys couldn't hear me?

3318
03:48:11,780 --> 03:48:13,139
I made like a bird noise.

3319
03:48:13,139 --> 03:48:13,620
Oh well.

3320
03:48:13,620 --> 03:48:15,860
I mean that means that we have good sound dampening.

3321
03:48:15,860 --> 03:48:16,260
That's good.

3322
03:48:17,139 --> 03:48:25,520
Is this in a good spot?

3323
03:48:26,159 --> 03:48:33,159
I hear is good right there.

3324
03:48:33,159 --> 03:48:33,719
That's all right.

3325
03:48:37,120 --> 03:48:40,280
We might have heard you.

3326
03:48:40,280 --> 03:48:41,239
We thought it was auto.

3327
03:48:41,239 --> 03:48:48,000
No, I went like pretty loud out there.

3328
03:48:48,639 --> 03:48:51,799
You're supposed to watch italics's stream

3329
03:48:51,799 --> 03:48:52,680
and see if you heard it.

3330
03:48:53,239 --> 03:48:57,360
All right.

3331
03:48:57,360 --> 03:48:58,879
So wait, don't fold these yet.

3332
03:48:58,879 --> 03:48:59,520
Fold them back.

3333
03:49:11,879 --> 03:49:14,200
Now the fact when you're freezing the big fold,

3334
03:49:14,200 --> 03:49:16,920
be careful not to fold this little mushroomy part.

3335
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:19,489
All right.

3336
03:49:20,370 --> 03:49:22,209
Don't fold the mushroomy part.

3337
03:49:36,159 --> 03:49:43,190
Fold it all up.

3338
03:49:47,760 --> 03:49:49,680
Left, right, up, down.

3339
03:49:49,680 --> 03:49:50,399
Fold it in here.

3340
03:49:54,959 --> 03:49:55,840
Thumbs up.

3341
03:49:56,159 --> 03:49:56,959
Careful.

3342
03:49:56,959 --> 03:50:01,670
It's a weird swing that that does all the way across.

3343
03:50:02,469 --> 03:50:05,989
And that folds up and then goes into the little tab

3344
03:50:05,989 --> 03:50:06,709
that's down there.

3345
03:50:06,709 --> 03:50:07,510
Do you see it?

3346
03:50:07,510 --> 03:50:08,469
Do you see it, folks?

3347
03:50:13,510 --> 03:50:13,829
That?

3348
03:50:16,389 --> 03:50:17,190
No, I don't.

3349
03:50:17,829 --> 03:50:22,469
Something on this side.

3350
03:50:23,270 --> 03:50:32,579
Back up with a little mushroom.

3351
03:50:33,299 --> 03:50:38,629
I did such a good job.

3352
03:50:39,270 --> 03:50:54,040
Okay.

3353
03:50:54,760 --> 03:50:56,120
Now turn the whole piece to its front

3354
03:50:56,120 --> 03:50:57,959
and check to make sure that the ends of both tabs

3355
03:50:57,959 --> 03:50:59,000
are sticking to the other side.

3356
03:50:59,959 --> 03:51:01,780
They are.

3357
03:51:01,780 --> 03:51:02,340
They are.

3358
03:51:03,059 --> 03:51:03,540
Okay.

3359
03:51:03,540 --> 03:51:04,020
They are.

3360
03:51:04,579 --> 03:51:08,690
Although this one's a little torn.

3361
03:51:08,690 --> 03:51:09,649
No, they are.

3362
03:51:09,649 --> 03:51:10,709
Looks fine.

3363
03:51:11,430 --> 03:51:15,620
Congratulatory wine chug.

3364
03:51:17,399 --> 03:51:18,120
I agree to that.

3365
03:51:31,799 --> 03:51:32,520
That piece is done for now.

3366
03:51:32,520 --> 03:51:33,239
We'll eat it again soon.

3367
03:51:33,239 --> 03:51:33,799
What soon?

3368
03:51:34,360 --> 03:51:35,079
Isn't soon enough.

3369
03:51:35,809 --> 03:51:36,370
Be patient.

3370
03:51:47,600 --> 03:51:48,319
Oh, this piece.

3371
03:51:49,829 --> 03:51:51,350
That was the weakest chug in the world.

3372
03:51:54,200 --> 03:51:54,520
Okay.

3373
03:52:12,879 --> 03:52:13,840
I can't spit this out.

3374
03:52:18,159 --> 03:52:18,399
Okay.

3375
03:52:31,010 --> 03:52:33,079
Never mind.

3376
03:52:46,229 --> 03:52:46,870
Hey, great job.

3377
03:52:56,479 --> 03:52:57,520
It's a new emo.

3378
03:53:10,100 --> 03:53:12,549
Now, do I fold those?

3379
03:53:12,549 --> 03:53:13,030
I don't know.

3380
03:53:13,030 --> 03:53:15,090
I didn't let the video game tell me.

3381
03:53:15,090 --> 03:53:15,889
Watch out.

3382
03:53:15,889 --> 03:53:19,200
This piece has a bit in the middle

3383
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:20,319
that you definitely shouldn't fold.

3384
03:53:20,319 --> 03:53:21,040
Try to keep that in mind

3385
03:53:21,040 --> 03:53:22,079
when you're folding the other bits.

3386
03:53:22,719 --> 03:53:26,319
I won't.

3387
03:53:26,319 --> 03:53:31,489
All right.

3388
03:53:31,489 --> 03:53:33,010
Fold this like that.

3389
03:53:33,010 --> 03:53:35,090
Looks good.

3390
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:38,040
Armpit sweat.

3391
03:53:38,040 --> 03:53:47,909
Give me a break.

3392
03:53:47,909 --> 03:53:50,770
It's been four hours.

3393
03:53:50,770 --> 03:53:51,569
It's four hours.

3394
03:53:51,569 --> 03:53:58,209
But drinking wine, it could be much worse.

3395
03:53:58,850 --> 03:53:59,569
Let me tell you.

3396
03:54:00,129 --> 03:54:03,639
I'm fine.

3397
03:54:03,639 --> 03:54:05,000
It's just perspiration.

3398
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:06,520
I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt.

3399
03:54:06,520 --> 03:54:08,040
I'm in Las Vegas.

3400
03:54:08,120 --> 03:54:09,479
You know how hot it is here?

3401
03:54:09,479 --> 03:54:11,079
It's like 42 degrees out right now.

3402
03:54:11,079 --> 03:54:11,959
It gets cold in the winter.

3403
03:54:12,850 --> 03:54:13,170
All right.

3404
03:54:13,170 --> 03:54:14,530
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it,

3405
03:54:14,530 --> 03:54:15,489
fold it, fold it, fold it.

3406
03:54:25,750 --> 03:54:26,950
It's fucking cold out right now.

3407
03:54:27,829 --> 03:54:29,430
Vegas is fucking chilly.

3408
03:54:30,659 --> 03:54:33,059
As like the kids say, as fuck.

3409
03:54:33,059 --> 03:54:33,540
You know what I mean?

3410
03:54:34,180 --> 03:54:40,530
Do I fold this?

3411
03:54:40,530 --> 03:54:41,409
Hold on.

3412
03:54:41,409 --> 03:54:52,319
Oh, I got to...

3413
03:54:53,360 --> 03:54:54,479
Chugging wine is like...

3414
03:54:55,969 --> 03:54:57,809
Nobody did that besides Bacchus.

3415
03:55:00,100 --> 03:55:02,579
Nobody chugs wine except for Bacchus.

3416
03:55:02,579 --> 03:55:04,340
It's the only person in history to ever do it.

3417
03:55:06,840 --> 03:55:07,479
All right.

3418
03:55:07,479 --> 03:55:09,319
Do I fold this one down?

3419
03:55:09,959 --> 03:55:15,879
I don't think I fold that one.

3420
03:55:15,879 --> 03:55:17,399
I don't think I did the top one down.

3421
03:55:18,120 --> 03:55:25,379
So this goes...

3422
03:55:25,379 --> 03:55:25,940
Oh, man.

3423
03:55:43,360 --> 03:55:44,799
That's a hard blink.

3424
03:55:46,479 --> 03:55:47,600
Why don't you do webcam?

3425
03:55:48,399 --> 03:55:51,590
Why don't you do webcam?

3426
03:55:51,590 --> 03:55:52,950
How come you never do face cam?

3427
03:55:53,510 --> 03:55:55,219
That was a hard blink.

3428
03:56:08,639 --> 03:56:09,360
Soft blink is...

3429
03:56:09,360 --> 03:56:10,719
A hard blink is like...

3430
03:56:10,719 --> 03:56:11,760
I'm lost.

3431
03:56:14,709 --> 03:56:21,780
I didn't do it.

3432
03:56:21,780 --> 03:56:22,340
It's fine.

3433
03:56:22,979 --> 03:56:27,280
What if I faint on stream?

3434
03:56:27,280 --> 03:56:27,840
I'm not gonna...

3435
03:56:27,840 --> 03:56:29,120
Why would I faint on stream?

3436
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:34,020
Did I miss a tab?

3437
03:56:38,440 --> 03:56:39,239
No, that's correct.

3438
03:56:39,239 --> 03:56:39,479
Right?

3439
03:56:39,479 --> 03:56:39,879
I got it.

3440
03:56:41,670 --> 03:56:43,909
We'll insert it into the part we finished just before this one.

3441
03:56:43,909 --> 03:56:45,989
Fold the flap at the bottom of the long gap here.

3442
03:56:45,989 --> 03:56:47,430
Down and out of the way.

3443
03:56:48,229 --> 03:56:51,510
What does it want me to do?

3444
03:56:51,510 --> 03:56:53,030
Fold the gap out of the way.

3445
03:56:53,030 --> 03:56:53,350
You said...

3446
03:56:53,350 --> 03:56:54,069
You just said it.

3447
03:56:54,069 --> 03:56:54,309
What is...

3448
03:56:54,309 --> 03:56:54,709
Where is it?

3449
03:56:55,670 --> 03:57:02,920
That goes down.

3450
03:57:03,559 --> 03:57:05,110
Look every at the screen.

3451
03:57:05,110 --> 03:57:06,790
Make sure that the part is facing the right direction.

3452
03:57:06,790 --> 03:57:07,989
Then insert as far as it will go.

3453
03:57:08,549 --> 03:57:15,700
It kind of goes in like this first.

3454
03:57:15,700 --> 03:57:17,620
It's like a D battery.

3455
03:57:18,659 --> 03:57:23,250
I didn't even fucking need the tutorial.

3456
03:57:26,389 --> 03:57:26,790
That's fine.

3457
03:57:26,790 --> 03:57:27,110
That works.

3458
03:57:27,750 --> 03:57:31,760
Now the sun stand will probably stand the piece up.

3459
03:57:31,760 --> 03:57:34,399
Hey, it doesn't look a bit like a koala's face.

3460
03:57:35,360 --> 03:57:44,159
I mean, it does.

3461
03:57:48,659 --> 03:57:49,299
Okay.

3462
03:57:49,299 --> 03:57:50,979
Is the piece facing the same way as on screen?

3463
03:57:50,979 --> 03:57:53,059
It'll be tricky to fix later if you get it wrong.

3464
03:57:53,059 --> 03:57:53,700
Double check.

3465
03:57:54,340 --> 03:58:05,360
I got it, right?

3466
03:58:05,360 --> 03:58:06,000
Yeah.

3467
03:58:06,000 --> 03:58:11,299
Everything looks good.

3468
03:58:11,299 --> 03:58:13,059
Let's lock it securely in the place of this piece here.

3469
03:58:13,059 --> 03:58:14,739
A long lost cousin of the quadruple.

3470
03:58:14,739 --> 03:58:16,180
I don't want to hear the fucking whole thing.

3471
03:58:16,979 --> 03:58:18,020
Turn it over and fold it in two.

3472
03:58:18,020 --> 03:58:19,299
Now it's ready to be locked.

3473
03:58:19,299 --> 03:58:20,020
Lock, lock, lock.

3474
03:58:20,020 --> 03:58:20,739
Lock, lock it.

3475
03:58:20,739 --> 03:58:21,459
Here's a lock.

3476
03:58:21,459 --> 03:58:22,180
Lock the thing.

3477
03:58:22,180 --> 03:58:22,739
Okay, great.

3478
03:58:23,700 --> 03:58:26,469
How did I chug that fucking line?

3479
03:58:26,469 --> 03:58:27,430
I was just going slow.

3480
03:58:28,549 --> 03:58:36,120
Shit.

3481
03:58:36,120 --> 03:58:41,600
I did it.

3482
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:42,000
I think.

3483
03:58:42,719 --> 03:58:46,610
Hold on.

3484
03:58:46,610 --> 03:58:48,690
I gave it a BRB for one second.

3485
03:59:51,510 --> 03:59:51,829
Shit.

3486
04:00:01,920 --> 04:00:04,399
That was deer in headlights.

3487
04:00:04,399 --> 04:00:06,159
I fucking hate face cams.

3488
04:00:06,159 --> 04:00:12,770
I wasn't ready for it and I pressed it.

3489
04:00:12,770 --> 04:00:22,629
I get embarrassed real easily.

3490
04:00:22,629 --> 04:00:23,170
All right.

3491
04:00:23,170 --> 04:00:23,969
Here we go.

3492
04:00:23,969 --> 04:00:35,139
All right.

3493
04:00:35,139 --> 04:00:35,620
Here, look.

3494
04:00:35,620 --> 04:00:36,739
It's a koala.

3495
04:00:36,739 --> 04:00:37,620
Right, Nintendo?

3496
04:00:39,729 --> 04:00:41,299
Ta-da.

3497
04:00:41,299 --> 04:00:42,260
It's all done.

3498
04:00:42,260 --> 04:00:42,739
I did it.

3499
04:00:42,739 --> 04:00:44,100
I finished the whole thing on stream.

3500
04:00:44,100 --> 04:00:44,739
It's over.

3501
04:00:44,739 --> 04:00:55,379
Where's that?

3502
04:00:55,459 --> 04:00:55,940
All right.

3503
04:00:55,940 --> 04:00:56,659
Get in there.

3504
04:00:57,459 --> 04:01:00,040
Stop it.

3505
04:01:00,040 --> 04:01:04,950
Okay.

3506
04:01:04,950 --> 04:01:08,420
So here we go.

3507
04:01:08,420 --> 04:01:13,750
Fold it up and get it in there like this.

3508
04:01:14,629 --> 04:01:19,360
Why is that off?

3509
04:01:19,360 --> 04:01:20,239
Why is this turned off?

3510
04:01:36,079 --> 04:02:03,760
Battery's dead.

3511
04:02:03,760 --> 04:02:04,959
Don't throw your phone behind me.

3512
04:02:05,969 --> 04:02:06,450
Okay.

3513
04:02:06,450 --> 04:02:07,090
What are we doing?

3514
04:02:07,090 --> 04:02:07,649
Here.

3515
04:02:07,649 --> 04:02:11,459
I was, it was, it was fucking dark in here.

3516
04:02:11,459 --> 04:02:12,020
I was like, what the hell?

3517
04:02:13,090 --> 04:02:13,889
I was like, what the hell?

3518
04:02:14,530 --> 04:02:16,819
Okay, so that matches up with here.

3519
04:02:17,379 --> 04:02:18,760
So you guys can see.

3520
04:02:22,629 --> 04:02:23,430
See what I'm talking about?

3521
04:02:23,989 --> 04:02:33,809
All right.

3522
04:02:33,809 --> 04:02:36,129
So the tabs need to, this comes down.

3523
04:02:42,319 --> 04:02:42,879
Whoa.

3524
04:02:42,879 --> 04:02:45,200
That, I get the other one quick.

3525
04:02:45,200 --> 04:02:45,760
Was it right?

3526
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:46,239
Is that correct?

3527
04:02:46,239 --> 04:02:46,959
I hope it's correct.

3528
04:02:47,760 --> 04:02:48,079
It is.

3529
04:02:51,299 --> 04:02:52,340
The engine is complete.

3530
04:02:58,920 --> 04:02:59,639
Wait, wait, wait.

3531
04:03:00,840 --> 04:03:24,629
What'd I tell you?

3532
04:03:56,719 --> 04:03:58,559
I got stains under my armpit.

3533
04:03:58,559 --> 04:04:00,000
Look at how good I look right now.

3534
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:01,040
I look fresh.

3535
04:04:01,040 --> 04:04:02,159
I look well rested.

3536
04:04:02,799 --> 04:04:03,520
Fast forward.

3537
04:04:04,559 --> 04:04:05,840
Seven and a half hours from now.

3538
04:04:05,840 --> 04:04:07,040
I bet you my hair's greasy.

3539
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:08,319
My face is watery.

3540
04:04:08,319 --> 04:04:10,559
And like I got stains under my armpit.

3541
04:04:10,559 --> 04:04:12,079
Look at how good I look right now.

3542
04:04:12,079 --> 04:04:13,120
I look fresh.

3543
04:04:13,120 --> 04:04:14,239
I look well rested.

3544
04:04:14,879 --> 04:04:15,600
Fast forward.

3545
04:04:16,639 --> 04:04:17,920
Seven and a half hours from now.

3546
04:04:17,920 --> 04:04:19,120
I bet you my hair's greasy.

3547
04:04:19,120 --> 04:04:20,399
My face is watery.

3548
04:04:20,399 --> 04:04:22,719
And like I got stains under my armpit.

3549
04:04:22,719 --> 04:04:24,159
Look at how good I look right now.

3550
04:04:24,159 --> 04:04:25,200
I look fresh.

3551
04:04:25,200 --> 04:04:26,959
I look well rested.

3552
04:04:26,959 --> 04:04:27,680
Fast forward.

3553
04:04:28,719 --> 04:04:30,000
Seven and a half hours from now.

3554
04:04:30,000 --> 04:04:31,200
I bet you my hair's greasy.

3555
04:04:31,200 --> 04:04:32,479
My face is watery.

3556
04:04:32,479 --> 04:04:34,719
And like I got stains under my armpit.

3557
04:04:34,719 --> 04:04:36,239
Look at how good I look right now.

3558
04:04:36,239 --> 04:04:37,280
I look fresh.

3559
04:04:37,280 --> 04:04:39,040
I look well rested.

3560
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:39,760
Fast forward.

3561
04:04:49,520 --> 04:04:50,239
Fuck that guy.

3562
04:04:50,959 --> 04:04:51,760
He doesn't know shit.

3563
04:05:01,540 --> 04:05:02,420
Oh, I lost it.

3564
04:05:02,420 --> 04:05:03,940
Wait, where did it go?

3565
04:05:03,940 --> 04:05:04,579
Where did it go?

3566
04:05:04,579 --> 04:05:05,059
It's gone.

3567
04:05:07,239 --> 04:05:07,559
I don't know.

3568
04:05:07,559 --> 04:05:08,680
I can't get it back.

3569
04:05:08,680 --> 04:05:09,959
Where's the other cam?

3570
04:05:09,959 --> 04:05:11,479
Where did the other camera go?

3571
04:05:16,790 --> 04:05:17,909
I actually fucking lost it.

3572
04:05:25,860 --> 04:05:40,840
Hey, hey.

3573
04:05:41,940 --> 04:05:43,299
Let me tell you guys something.

3574
04:05:43,299 --> 04:05:44,579
Fast forward right now.

3575
04:05:45,459 --> 04:05:47,219
Three or four hours from now.

3576
04:05:47,219 --> 04:05:49,700
I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.

3577
04:05:49,700 --> 04:05:51,059
My face is going to be greasy.

3578
04:05:51,059 --> 04:05:52,819
I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.

3579
04:05:52,819 --> 04:05:54,579
I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.

3580
04:05:54,579 --> 04:05:56,579
Water's going to be pouring down my shirt.

3581
04:05:56,579 --> 04:05:57,780
It's going to look really bad.

3582
04:05:57,780 --> 04:05:58,819
Just remember this.

3583
04:05:58,819 --> 04:06:00,340
Like three or four hours from now, okay?

3584
04:06:02,020 --> 04:06:02,659
Remember this.

3585
04:06:24,870 --> 04:06:26,469
Making the levers and lever holders.

3586
04:06:26,469 --> 04:06:27,430
That's my favorite part.

3587
04:06:28,149 --> 04:06:30,209
Get down there.

3588
04:06:30,209 --> 04:06:32,040
All right, forward.

3589
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:33,000
I said we're almost done.

3590
04:06:33,719 --> 04:06:47,479
Okay, levers and holders.

3591
04:06:49,329 --> 04:06:50,180
D and G.

3592
04:06:51,299 --> 04:07:01,840
Okay, I'd eat D.

3593
04:07:04,500 --> 04:07:07,600
Last part from D.

3594
04:07:07,600 --> 04:07:08,719
This is D, right?

3595
04:07:08,719 --> 04:07:09,840
Oh, shit.

3596
04:07:10,479 --> 04:07:20,770
This one's F.

3597
04:07:25,379 --> 04:07:30,469
D, you got it.

3598
04:07:30,469 --> 04:07:33,030
Okay, D and then all that shit up there.

3599
04:07:33,590 --> 04:07:34,389
I don't know what that's for,

3600
04:07:34,389 --> 04:07:35,270
but it's for something later.

3601
04:07:36,149 --> 04:07:46,719
Watch out.

3602
04:07:53,620 --> 04:07:56,420
Oh, you know, you just want to like stuff your face

3603
04:07:56,420 --> 04:07:59,700
and your dog's body and just smell his dog's smell.

3604
04:08:00,739 --> 04:08:02,260
I want to do that so bad right now.

3605
04:08:12,049 --> 04:08:13,649
People writing question marks right now.

3606
04:08:14,690 --> 04:08:15,569
Excuse me.

3607
04:08:15,569 --> 04:08:16,129
Give me a break.

3608
04:08:21,780 --> 04:08:23,299
The savory dog smell.

3609
04:08:24,020 --> 04:08:25,379
Am I fucking out of my mind?

3610
04:08:25,379 --> 04:08:26,100
What are you talking about?

3611
04:08:33,329 --> 04:08:34,930
You guys know what I'm talking about.

3612
04:08:34,930 --> 04:08:36,770
Do I really need to talk about that?

3613
04:08:36,770 --> 04:08:37,569
What are you talking about?

3614
04:08:45,430 --> 04:08:48,069
I don't understand the people that are writing question marks here.

3615
04:08:48,069 --> 04:08:49,030
I really don't understand it.

3616
04:08:49,590 --> 04:08:56,100
Oh, I'm seeing 50-50 here.

3617
04:08:56,739 --> 04:08:57,780
You're a psycho.

3618
04:08:57,780 --> 04:08:58,020
What?

3619
04:09:00,100 --> 04:09:03,459
It's the dog, like the Frito's dog smell.

3620
04:09:03,459 --> 04:09:04,420
What are you talking about?

3621
04:09:05,700 --> 04:09:10,370
You guys not have a dog?

3622
04:09:11,010 --> 04:09:21,139
I'm being fucking annihilated right now in chat.

3623
04:09:21,139 --> 04:09:21,540
For what?

3624
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:30,239
I can't believe it.

3625
04:09:30,879 --> 04:09:31,840
I can't believe it.

3626
04:09:32,950 --> 04:09:34,870
I'm being annihilated in my own chat.

3627
04:09:36,450 --> 04:09:37,569
Chat, I'm being annihilated.

3628
04:09:37,569 --> 04:09:39,409
Why am I, like I'm in an opera?

3629
04:09:39,409 --> 04:09:40,049
All right, let's go.

3630
04:09:41,809 --> 04:09:42,850
I'm surprised.

3631
04:09:43,569 --> 04:09:52,879
The levers of the secret sauce for the McDonald's number one

3632
04:09:52,879 --> 04:09:55,360
is the best item of any menu on any menu.

3633
04:09:56,000 --> 04:09:57,040
You find it in the play section.

3634
04:09:57,040 --> 04:09:58,319
Whatever, fuck off.

3635
04:09:58,319 --> 04:09:58,959
All right, let's go.

3636
04:10:00,079 --> 04:10:02,120
Oh, fold the lines with both hands.

3637
04:10:02,120 --> 04:10:04,120
It'll make sure that the McDonald's number one

3638
04:10:04,120 --> 04:10:05,399
Big Mac is the best menu item.

3639
04:10:06,280 --> 04:10:15,729
Okay, like that.

3640
04:10:19,110 --> 04:10:21,190
Savoring dog sauce.

3641
04:10:23,059 --> 04:10:23,540
What was this?

3642
04:10:24,180 --> 04:10:24,579
I don't know.

3643
04:10:25,379 --> 04:10:40,120
Okay, don't fold this part.

3644
04:10:43,079 --> 04:10:43,719
Take the pole.

3645
04:10:44,680 --> 04:10:45,000
Okay.

3646
04:10:49,799 --> 04:10:50,840
Dog smell.

3647
04:10:50,840 --> 04:10:52,040
Yes, shove your face in it.

3648
04:10:52,040 --> 04:10:52,760
No, you're drunk.

3649
04:10:54,680 --> 04:10:55,799
Yes, shove your face in it.

3650
04:10:56,739 --> 04:10:59,670
And by the way, I mean,

3651
04:10:59,670 --> 04:11:01,750
when you get bailed out from your own community,

3652
04:11:02,790 --> 04:11:04,389
60% of the vote.

3653
04:11:04,389 --> 04:11:05,510
Yes, shove your face in it.

3654
04:11:12,469 --> 04:11:13,030
60%.

3655
04:11:14,309 --> 04:11:20,760
You still don't understand.

3656
04:11:25,379 --> 04:11:28,579
61% now agrees.

3657
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:32,319
39%, that's not even like,

3658
04:11:32,959 --> 04:11:38,920
that's a vocal minority.

3659
04:11:38,920 --> 04:11:41,239
No, that is a voting majority.

3660
04:11:41,959 --> 04:11:44,200
I'm sorry, but that's a majority.

3661
04:11:44,840 --> 04:11:46,260
Don't even need to look at it anymore.

3662
04:11:46,260 --> 04:11:48,770
I voted.

3663
04:11:48,770 --> 04:11:49,329
I voted.

3664
04:11:49,329 --> 04:11:58,469
What am I making now?

3665
04:12:01,940 --> 04:12:03,360
Two guys going like this.

3666
04:12:04,159 --> 04:12:11,250
Dog breath is gross.

3667
04:12:11,250 --> 04:12:12,450
It's not dog breath.

3668
04:12:12,450 --> 04:12:15,090
It's the savory sleepy dog smell.

3669
04:12:15,090 --> 04:12:15,590
What?

3670
04:12:16,469 --> 04:12:17,909
How do you not know what this is?

3671
04:12:19,590 --> 04:12:22,149
If you have a dog and the dog is sleeping

3672
04:12:22,790 --> 04:12:25,920
and you walk over to your dog that is asleep

3673
04:12:26,559 --> 04:12:28,159
and you pet the dog's back

3674
04:12:28,159 --> 04:12:29,600
and the dog wakes up for a second.

3675
04:12:30,159 --> 04:12:32,239
Whoa, savory, sleepy dog smell.

3676
04:12:34,790 --> 04:12:37,510
I don't understand how you don't get that.

3677
04:12:39,399 --> 04:12:41,079
No idea what I'm talking about.

3678
04:12:41,079 --> 04:12:41,879
No idea.

3679
04:12:41,879 --> 04:12:43,959
People have no idea what I mean by this.

3680
04:12:48,280 --> 04:12:50,280
I don't, I don't, how is this possible?

3681
04:12:50,840 --> 04:13:03,299
I don't, I don't get it.

3682
04:13:11,350 --> 04:13:11,829
You're weird.

3683
04:13:11,829 --> 04:13:12,790
I'm not weird.

3684
04:13:12,790 --> 04:13:13,750
What the fuck?

3685
04:13:13,750 --> 04:13:14,469
This is real.

3686
04:13:18,420 --> 04:13:20,420
You're making this up for views.

3687
04:13:21,139 --> 04:13:25,170
I don't do that shit.

3688
04:13:25,889 --> 04:13:34,450
I feel like I'm being attacked.

3689
04:13:46,149 --> 04:13:49,750
Dog sniffer own facts and logic.

3690
04:13:50,549 --> 04:13:51,049
Okay.

3691
04:13:51,750 --> 04:13:53,079
Believe me.

3692
04:13:53,079 --> 04:13:53,559
Here we go.

3693
04:14:03,430 --> 04:14:04,870
I thought everybody knew what that was.

3694
04:14:05,750 --> 04:14:08,100
I thought I was going to be like,

3695
04:14:08,100 --> 04:14:09,139
oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

3696
04:14:09,139 --> 04:14:10,819
but I'm like the weirdo apparently.

3697
04:14:11,459 --> 04:14:12,899
Kim talks about this shit too.

3698
04:14:20,469 --> 04:14:22,629
I want to take this to the fucking supreme court.

3699
04:14:23,430 --> 04:14:28,600
Does the dog smelly dog sleepy smell exist?

3700
04:14:30,979 --> 04:14:31,860
I don't know.

3701
04:14:31,860 --> 04:14:32,500
I'm not sure.

3702
04:14:33,299 --> 04:14:43,030
This is not going to even leave your district.

3703
04:14:43,030 --> 04:14:43,909
Oh, okay.

3704
04:14:45,409 --> 04:14:46,290
See you in court.

3705
04:14:48,420 --> 04:14:50,100
Guy that won't show up.

3706
04:14:50,100 --> 04:14:53,219
That's some kind of fucking currency thing.

3707
04:14:55,719 --> 04:14:56,760
Is my hair purple?

3708
04:14:57,399 --> 04:15:00,930
My hair is like a dirty blonde.

3709
04:15:00,930 --> 04:15:01,430
Brown.

3710
04:15:06,079 --> 04:15:08,159
I don't smell my dog like a lunatic.

3711
04:15:19,879 --> 04:15:21,639
Reddit slash dog lovers.

3712
04:15:25,510 --> 04:15:27,510
Reddit slash pet owners.

3713
04:15:28,819 --> 04:15:30,340
Reddit slash pet owners.

3714
04:15:56,079 --> 04:16:15,159
Thank you dad hunter for the $20.

3715
04:16:16,639 --> 04:16:17,520
Hydrate.

3716
04:16:17,520 --> 04:16:18,979
I did downstairs.

3717
04:16:18,979 --> 04:16:19,540
Don't worry.

3718
04:16:19,540 --> 04:16:27,889
Don't make me fucking get in it.

3719
04:16:27,889 --> 04:16:29,250
Don't make me get a variable in here.

3720
04:16:29,809 --> 04:16:31,280
I'll go get him.

3721
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:35,399
I'm gonna go stop his stream to bring him in here.

3722
04:16:37,010 --> 04:16:38,530
I'll say your stream is over right now.

3723
04:16:38,530 --> 04:16:39,969
You're coming in here and fucking talking.

3724
04:16:40,610 --> 04:16:45,280
We'll get to the bottom of this real quick.

3725
04:16:46,000 --> 04:16:52,370
Is he still streaming?

3726
04:17:23,120 --> 04:17:23,840
Lock your door.

3727
04:17:24,399 --> 04:17:24,979
Don't worry.

3728
04:17:24,979 --> 04:17:25,700
Minus will bark.

3729
04:17:25,700 --> 04:17:26,819
He'll let me know what's going on.

3730
04:17:31,670 --> 04:17:32,549
Lock your door.

3731
04:17:34,500 --> 04:17:36,819
There's no locks on the doors in this house.

3732
04:17:42,659 --> 04:17:43,379
Excuse me.

3733
04:17:43,379 --> 04:17:45,120
Excuse me, doctor.

3734
04:18:49,319 --> 04:18:50,040
God damn.

3735
04:19:06,520 --> 04:19:09,399
Dogs have a savory, sleepy smell.

3736
04:19:09,399 --> 04:19:32,290
I'll call her.

3737
04:19:32,290 --> 04:19:33,170
I'll call her.

3738
04:19:33,170 --> 04:19:34,340
Call her right now.

3739
04:19:34,340 --> 04:19:35,379
No, she's working.

3740
04:19:35,379 --> 04:19:39,270
That's not smart.

3741
04:19:39,270 --> 04:19:39,909
I'm stuck.

3742
04:19:50,639 --> 04:19:51,760
Dogs have a savory.

3743
04:19:51,760 --> 04:19:54,440
Ah, he can't hear me.

3744
04:19:54,440 --> 04:19:55,159
Okay, hey.

3745
04:19:55,159 --> 04:19:59,059
So, uh, Nintendo Switch.

3746
04:19:59,059 --> 04:20:22,920
Okay, so folding lines and it's real.

3747
04:20:22,920 --> 04:20:23,639
Somebody get it.

3748
04:20:24,819 --> 04:20:25,299
What's a poll?

3749
04:20:25,299 --> 04:20:25,940
Where's that poll?

3750
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:27,139
Somebody link the poll right now.

3751
04:20:27,780 --> 04:20:31,670
Critical has a dog?

3752
04:20:32,739 --> 04:20:33,620
He fucking gets it.

3753
04:20:34,260 --> 04:20:34,899
Guaranteed.

3754
04:20:34,899 --> 04:20:36,340
I guarantee he gets it.

3755
04:20:37,600 --> 04:20:39,360
Ask Critical next time he streams.

3756
04:20:39,360 --> 04:20:41,600
Does a dog have a savory, sleepy smell?

3757
04:20:41,600 --> 04:20:44,159
Like the savory dog smell?

3758
04:20:44,159 --> 04:20:45,540
He'll fucking get it.

3759
04:20:45,540 --> 04:20:46,180
I know he will.

3760
04:20:54,600 --> 04:20:55,719
I don't have his phone number.

3761
04:20:56,520 --> 04:20:57,079
Call him.

3762
04:20:57,079 --> 04:20:57,319
Call.

3763
04:20:57,319 --> 04:20:58,920
I don't have his fucking telephone number.

3764
04:20:59,479 --> 04:21:00,600
Is Jermuff weird?

3765
04:21:02,370 --> 04:21:03,729
This is two votes.

3766
04:21:05,329 --> 04:21:14,959
We're gonna read it.

3767
04:21:14,959 --> 04:21:15,440
Wait, wait, wait.

3768
04:21:15,440 --> 04:21:16,479
We got a Reddit thread here.

3769
04:21:19,959 --> 04:21:21,239
Is it weird to smell your dog?

3770
04:21:21,239 --> 04:21:22,680
I made a poll and got some responses.

3771
04:21:23,319 --> 04:21:25,000
Spelling the dog full face style.

3772
04:21:25,000 --> 04:21:25,799
What are your opinions?

3773
04:21:27,430 --> 04:21:28,549
Okay, let's see what Reddit says.

3774
04:21:29,489 --> 04:21:31,170
Is this some kind of currency?

3775
04:21:31,170 --> 04:21:33,090
I like dogs sniff the savory dog.

3776
04:21:33,989 --> 04:21:34,549
That helps.

3777
04:21:36,149 --> 04:21:37,030
That helps a lot.

3778
04:21:37,030 --> 04:21:37,989
Look, fresh.

3779
04:21:37,989 --> 04:21:39,110
I look well rested.

3780
04:21:40,549 --> 04:21:41,670
Wrong, wrong thing.

3781
04:21:47,299 --> 04:21:48,180
Call Critical.

3782
04:21:48,180 --> 04:21:50,979
I don't have his telephone identification number.

3783
04:21:53,139 --> 04:21:54,579
How did my dog get outside?

3784
04:21:59,110 --> 04:22:08,610
He's like, hey, let me in.

3785
04:22:36,659 --> 04:22:37,379
I got it.

3786
04:22:37,379 --> 04:22:38,260
I got it.

3787
04:22:38,260 --> 04:22:43,440
I know I'm right.

3788
04:22:47,430 --> 04:22:50,069
We ask who's streaming now.

3789
04:22:53,760 --> 04:22:58,680
Okay, looks good.

3790
04:23:02,600 --> 04:23:04,360
Pull the flap down like this.

3791
04:23:08,389 --> 04:23:09,110
I can't go in.

3792
04:23:11,079 --> 04:23:12,200
First lever is done.

3793
04:23:20,879 --> 04:23:21,760
Ask Discord.

3794
04:23:21,760 --> 04:23:25,440
I know, I know what I know, okay?

3795
04:23:38,049 --> 04:23:39,489
Ask UberHackZeroNova.

3796
04:23:41,700 --> 04:23:42,500
He would know too.

3797
04:23:43,299 --> 04:24:02,120
I'm not sniffing my dog's ass.

3798
04:24:02,760 --> 04:24:04,879
I'm not sniffing my dog's ass.

3799
04:24:05,840 --> 04:24:22,799
Okay, first of all, I just did the Adam Sandler gibberish thing from Billy Madison.

3800
04:24:23,360 --> 04:24:28,690
I'm sorry.

3801
04:24:29,409 --> 04:24:34,920
Critical said you're sick.

3802
04:24:35,639 --> 04:24:36,879
Get him in here.

3803
04:24:36,879 --> 04:24:37,520
Get him in here.

3804
04:24:37,520 --> 04:24:38,000
Get him in here.

3805
04:24:38,000 --> 04:24:38,479
Where is he?

3806
04:24:39,040 --> 04:24:40,260
Where is he?

3807
04:24:40,260 --> 04:24:40,579
Right now.

3808
04:24:40,579 --> 04:24:41,860
I'll talk to him right now.

3809
04:24:41,860 --> 04:24:42,739
I'll talk to him right now.

3810
04:24:43,379 --> 04:24:45,090
I'll talk to him right now.

3811
04:24:45,729 --> 04:24:46,290
Where is he?

3812
04:24:46,850 --> 04:24:48,159
This is a PlayStation.

3813
04:24:48,159 --> 04:24:49,520
That's PlayStation.

3814
04:24:49,520 --> 04:24:52,549
What did I draw?

3815
04:24:52,549 --> 04:24:52,870
Get it?

3816
04:24:52,870 --> 04:24:53,350
Where is he?

3817
04:24:54,149 --> 04:24:55,430
Oh, don't hit the escape button.

3818
04:24:55,430 --> 04:25:01,440
Don't stop streaming.

3819
04:25:01,440 --> 04:25:03,360
Critical said smell my asshole.

3820
04:25:06,040 --> 04:25:06,600
Really?

3821
04:25:06,600 --> 04:25:41,299
This fucking Reese's commercial.

3822
04:25:41,299 --> 04:25:52,420
He's playing RuneScape right now.

3823
04:25:52,420 --> 04:25:55,959
Try this in Tob.

3824
04:26:07,000 --> 04:26:09,000
Let's check out this fucking Twisted Bone, Tob.

3825
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:09,879
Any other games tonight?

3826
04:26:22,479 --> 04:26:24,319
You made Buzz and Soul Calibur.

3827
04:26:24,319 --> 04:26:25,280
I'm excited to see them.

3828
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:44,450
I can't get anybody.

3829
04:26:44,450 --> 04:26:46,770
I can't get a goddamn person on my side.

3830
04:26:47,489 --> 04:26:50,719
Oh, that was Critical.

3831
04:26:50,719 --> 04:26:52,239
He's a fucking swell boy.

3832
04:26:54,870 --> 04:26:55,670
What am I doing?

3833
04:26:56,389 --> 04:27:20,290
Jerma is on a mildly drunken tirade

3834
04:27:20,290 --> 04:27:22,049
to tell people, to show people

3835
04:27:22,049 --> 04:27:24,610
that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.

3836
04:27:24,610 --> 04:27:26,389
All right, you can tell him

3837
04:27:26,389 --> 04:27:28,790
that he can smell my asshole.

3838
04:27:28,790 --> 04:27:43,620
So we're almost done with the engine.

3839
04:27:43,620 --> 04:27:46,870
Getting close.

3840
04:27:48,479 --> 04:27:50,479
Getting close to the engine being done.

3841
04:27:50,479 --> 04:27:53,280
It's a...

3842
04:27:54,479 --> 04:27:56,000
No, hey, we're not over the engine.

3843
04:27:56,000 --> 04:27:57,120
Oh, we're part of the engine too.

3844
04:27:58,239 --> 04:27:59,520
I'm doing more Adam Sandler.

3845
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:00,799
I can't get...

3846
04:28:00,799 --> 04:28:07,430
What does Star have to say?

3847
04:28:07,430 --> 04:28:08,309
Where's Star?

3848
04:28:08,309 --> 04:28:09,190
Star's streaming?

3849
04:28:09,190 --> 04:28:11,170
I can get him.

3850
04:28:11,170 --> 04:28:27,600
He's off one.

3851
04:28:27,600 --> 04:28:28,399
Get him.

3852
04:28:28,399 --> 04:28:28,799
Get him.

3853
04:28:29,670 --> 04:28:30,309
Get him.

3854
04:28:30,309 --> 04:28:31,190
Like, no, no, no, no.

3855
04:28:31,190 --> 04:28:34,690
I mean, like, I'm the engine of the Nintendo.

3856
04:28:56,879 --> 04:28:59,040
Charlie just called me thin skin.

3857
04:28:59,040 --> 04:29:06,819
That shit to me.

3858
04:29:06,819 --> 04:29:15,860
Well, tell him I'm fucking busy building a lab ball.

3859
04:29:15,860 --> 04:29:20,610
I missed it.

3860
04:29:20,610 --> 04:29:23,829
Streamer battle?

3861
04:29:23,829 --> 04:29:28,930
Fine.

3862
04:29:28,930 --> 04:29:30,549
Ask him if he can do that.

3863
04:29:30,549 --> 04:29:31,750
Can Charlie do that?

3864
04:29:31,750 --> 04:29:34,899
Can Charlie do this?

3865
04:29:34,899 --> 04:29:41,190
Didn't think so.

3866
04:29:41,190 --> 04:29:57,030
Careful of dying.

3867
04:29:58,069 --> 04:29:58,950
I'm not dying.

3868
04:29:58,950 --> 04:29:59,590
I'm fine.

3869
04:29:59,590 --> 04:30:03,989
I can't even get a streamer to back me up.

3870
04:30:03,989 --> 04:30:05,190
Where's RT?

3871
04:30:05,190 --> 04:30:08,680
I don't need the headphones.

3872
04:30:08,680 --> 04:30:10,870
Is RT still here?

3873
04:30:10,870 --> 04:30:12,229
RT game proud?

3874
04:30:12,229 --> 04:30:35,559
He's down for the challenge.

3875
04:30:35,559 --> 04:30:36,920
Critical is down for the challenge.

3876
04:30:36,920 --> 04:30:38,120
There's no challenge.

3877
04:30:38,120 --> 04:30:39,399
I'm not challenging anybody.

3878
04:30:39,399 --> 04:30:40,360
I was just going like this.

3879
04:30:47,670 --> 04:30:48,309
End quotes.

3880
04:30:48,950 --> 04:30:49,989
You better watch out for this.

3881
04:30:51,510 --> 04:30:55,729
He's destroying me.

3882
04:30:55,729 --> 04:30:56,370
No, he's not.

3883
04:30:56,370 --> 04:30:57,649
Get that fuck out of here.

3884
04:30:58,370 --> 04:30:59,329
Give me those headphones.

3885
04:30:59,969 --> 04:31:02,930
He threw cards at me?

3886
04:31:02,930 --> 04:31:03,969
Cards?

3887
04:31:03,969 --> 04:31:08,200
What's he saying?

3888
04:31:08,760 --> 04:31:09,489
Give me a clip.

3889
04:31:12,200 --> 04:31:15,239
I know people that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.

3890
04:31:16,040 --> 04:31:16,659
All right.

3891
04:31:16,659 --> 04:31:19,059
You can tell him that he can smell my ass.

3892
04:31:19,059 --> 04:31:20,020
That's the same one.

3893
04:31:20,020 --> 04:31:23,059
What am I getting challenged to?

3894
04:31:23,860 --> 04:31:27,219
Jerma wants to know if I can karate chop my hand.

3895
04:31:27,219 --> 04:31:27,540
Like what?

3896
04:31:27,540 --> 04:31:31,620
Some type of fucking outraged child going through an episode?

3897
04:31:31,620 --> 04:31:33,459
I can do something so much better, Jerma.

3898
04:31:33,459 --> 04:31:33,700
Here.

3899
04:31:33,700 --> 04:31:34,899
You tell Jerma this.

3900
04:31:34,899 --> 04:31:39,520
If he wants to throw down, I'll fucking hit him with these playing cards.

3901
04:31:40,079 --> 04:31:40,879
Gambit style.

3902
04:31:42,079 --> 04:31:42,719
Oh, fuck.

3903
04:31:42,959 --> 04:31:43,280
I don't know.

3904
04:31:43,280 --> 04:31:44,719
I'm a fucking fearsome fighter.

3905
04:31:45,360 --> 04:31:47,920
I fucking fucking get after it.

3906
04:31:47,920 --> 04:31:48,799
You see this, Jerma?

3907
04:31:49,840 --> 04:31:50,159
Huh?

3908
04:31:53,780 --> 04:31:56,100
I'm not dealing with an amateur here.

3909
04:31:56,100 --> 04:32:03,860
I thought I was dealing with an amateur for a second.

3910
04:32:03,860 --> 04:32:07,350
It's fine, Charlie.

3911
04:32:07,989 --> 04:32:09,920
I'll get you to do this.

3912
04:32:24,209 --> 04:32:25,729
You couldn't even tell how fast that was.

3913
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:03,840
That was so fast.

3914
04:33:03,840 --> 04:33:04,639
I couldn't even tell.

3915
04:33:05,799 --> 04:33:08,759
That kick may have been 2,000 miles per hour.

3916
04:33:08,759 --> 04:33:09,560
I would just be careful.

3917
04:33:11,639 --> 04:33:12,840
I gotta be careful every time I do that.

3918
04:33:32,020 --> 04:34:16,869
I have no allies.

3919
04:34:16,869 --> 04:34:17,990
I don't need allies.

3920
04:34:19,000 --> 04:34:25,250
You see the kind of fucking man I am?

3921
04:34:25,250 --> 04:34:25,970
Oh, I lost.

3922
04:34:25,970 --> 04:34:26,369
Hold on.

3923
04:34:26,369 --> 04:34:28,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3924
04:34:30,689 --> 04:34:35,799
Don't need allies.

3925
04:34:37,540 --> 04:34:39,220
Stronger than all of them combined.

3926
04:34:45,080 --> 04:34:46,680
What more needs to be said?

3927
04:34:47,720 --> 04:34:48,200
Nothing.

3928
04:34:49,799 --> 04:34:50,520
You know what I mean?

3929
04:34:52,360 --> 04:34:52,919
It's it.

3930
04:34:53,639 --> 04:34:56,000
What more needs to be said?

3931
04:35:04,369 --> 04:35:05,009
Call Joel.

3932
04:35:08,630 --> 04:35:10,069
Joel, like, Vinesauce Joel?

3933
04:35:11,759 --> 04:35:13,040
I feel like he'd be on my side.

3934
04:35:13,599 --> 04:35:18,549
I mean, like, he's a fucking talented, funny man.

3935
04:35:18,549 --> 04:35:20,310
I feel like he'd be on my side on this.

3936
04:35:20,310 --> 04:35:21,189
Of course he would.

3937
04:35:32,790 --> 04:35:34,709
Look, I'm just trying to fucking build a labo.

3938
04:35:41,700 --> 04:35:42,819
Joel is streaming.

3939
04:35:42,819 --> 04:35:44,580
I'm sure he's streaming something fucking fun

3940
04:35:45,220 --> 04:35:46,340
for all of you to enjoy.

3941
04:35:48,040 --> 04:35:49,240
I'm gonna leave.

3942
04:35:52,099 --> 04:35:53,939
Stop invading streamers.

3943
04:35:54,900 --> 04:35:55,700
I didn't.

3944
04:35:55,700 --> 04:35:56,900
I didn't invade anybody.

3945
04:35:57,860 --> 04:35:58,979
I didn't invade anybody.

3946
04:36:00,290 --> 04:36:01,169
I was told...

3947
04:36:04,799 --> 04:36:06,560
I didn't invade anyone.

3948
04:36:06,560 --> 04:36:08,919
You want me to invade?

3949
04:36:09,639 --> 04:36:11,159
I'm giving you fucking invade.

3950
04:36:11,959 --> 04:36:17,970
Excuse me, Otto.

3951
04:36:17,970 --> 04:36:20,080
Can you move just one second?

3952
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:22,400
Just move right here, Otto.

3953
04:36:22,400 --> 04:36:24,180
Otto, you need to move out of the way.

3954
04:36:41,400 --> 04:37:28,279
He's being a good keeper.

3955
04:37:30,950 --> 04:38:33,590
Better not be coming in here.

3956
04:38:33,590 --> 04:38:36,229
I told him my office was off limits.

3957
04:38:36,790 --> 04:38:39,569
He better not fucking come in here.

3958
04:38:39,569 --> 04:38:44,549
You know what I mean?

3959
04:38:44,549 --> 04:38:46,869
You better not fucking come in here.

3960
04:38:47,509 --> 04:38:56,709
See?

3961
04:39:09,650 --> 04:39:11,250
Can I finish the fucking steering wheel?

3962
04:39:28,180 --> 04:39:28,979
Piss my pants.

3963
04:39:30,340 --> 04:39:34,310
Where's the other piece?

3964
04:39:35,110 --> 04:39:36,069
I found it.

3965
04:39:36,069 --> 04:39:37,110
Relax, Charlie.

3966
04:39:37,990 --> 04:39:42,389
Yeah, I was on your podcast.

3967
04:39:43,110 --> 04:39:44,880
It was fun.

3968
04:39:44,880 --> 04:39:48,240
It was like a lot of fun.

3969
04:39:49,110 --> 04:39:51,270
You're like fucking cool and shit.

3970
04:39:55,799 --> 04:39:56,759
You're like nice.

3971
04:39:56,759 --> 04:39:57,720
You're like really nice.

3972
04:39:58,599 --> 04:40:00,119
You're like a wicked nice fucking guy.

3973
04:40:00,840 --> 04:40:04,040
This is a lot of fun.

3974
04:40:05,220 --> 04:40:11,990
Okay, so let's go.

3975
04:40:15,330 --> 04:40:23,619
We're in.

3976
04:40:23,619 --> 04:40:25,860
The little sticky outy bit on each side

3977
04:40:25,860 --> 04:40:26,819
pops into the gap here.

3978
04:40:26,819 --> 04:40:28,099
That's why it was so important

3979
04:40:28,099 --> 04:40:29,540
for this bit to stay unfolded.

3980
04:40:31,599 --> 04:40:32,319
Charlie, let me...

3981
04:40:43,299 --> 04:40:45,220
Ah, fucking rubber bands.

3982
04:40:45,220 --> 04:40:49,680
I'm muted?

3983
04:40:50,500 --> 04:40:51,220
No, I'm fine.

3984
04:40:51,779 --> 04:40:52,740
Oh, I'm fine.

3985
04:40:53,540 --> 04:40:54,500
Can't wait to do this,

3986
04:40:54,500 --> 04:40:55,860
bullshit Nintendo.

3987
04:40:55,860 --> 04:40:57,860
Great fucking in feature you got there.

3988
04:40:58,659 --> 04:41:02,740
What is this?

3989
04:41:02,740 --> 04:41:03,220
What is this?

3990
04:41:09,959 --> 04:41:10,840
Yes, a visitor.

3991
04:41:13,799 --> 04:41:16,720
Okay.

3992
04:41:17,279 --> 04:41:21,250
I was getting a drink,

3993
04:41:21,250 --> 04:41:23,090
but I've been stopped at the door.

3994
04:41:25,189 --> 04:41:26,549
Did you come in here for a reason?

3995
04:41:27,750 --> 04:41:54,340
Small rubber bands.

3996
04:42:01,409 --> 04:42:03,330
Why am I sending people to other streams?

3997
04:42:03,330 --> 04:42:04,369
I don't give a shit.

3998
04:42:05,490 --> 04:42:06,930
Ah, I just dropped one.

3999
04:42:07,810 --> 04:42:12,529
I broke my fucking desk.

4000
04:42:28,790 --> 04:42:30,069
Look, if you want to watch somebody,

4001
04:42:30,069 --> 04:42:33,750
I love that you want to support other streamers.

4002
04:42:35,810 --> 04:42:36,529
Watch Charlie.

4003
04:42:36,529 --> 04:42:37,569
He's good.

4004
04:42:38,209 --> 04:42:39,330
Italic's good.

4005
04:42:40,130 --> 04:42:40,610
Star.

4006
04:42:42,069 --> 04:42:43,110
Don't watch him.

4007
04:42:44,069 --> 04:42:45,349
Not that good.

4008
04:42:45,349 --> 04:42:46,229
It's pretty bad.

4009
04:42:47,750 --> 04:42:48,790
It's not good.

4010
04:42:51,029 --> 04:42:51,830
Vinny.

4011
04:42:51,830 --> 04:42:52,150
Yes.

4012
04:42:53,189 --> 04:42:54,869
Vinny's a fucking talented guy.

4013
04:42:56,450 --> 04:42:56,930
Star.

4014
04:43:00,419 --> 04:43:15,750
To be completely,

4015
04:43:15,750 --> 04:43:17,669
all complete honesty though,

4016
04:43:19,799 --> 04:43:20,680
Star's a great guy.

4017
04:43:21,840 --> 04:43:24,159
Don't think otherwise ever for any reason for real.

4018
04:43:24,799 --> 04:43:29,090
Okay, let's go right in the middle here.

4019
04:43:29,889 --> 04:43:30,290
Right here.

4020
04:43:32,709 --> 04:43:34,069
Natalix is not talking shit.

4021
04:43:34,709 --> 04:43:46,240
That's in.

4022
04:43:46,799 --> 04:43:56,759
I told you I had a drink to play these games.

4023
04:43:56,759 --> 04:43:57,799
Labo especially.

4024
04:44:00,279 --> 04:44:01,880
What the fuck did he say?

4025
04:44:02,759 --> 04:44:03,240
Wait, wait.

4026
04:44:03,240 --> 04:44:04,439
This is important.

4027
04:44:04,439 --> 04:44:05,639
I will go off.

4028
04:44:06,279 --> 04:44:09,619
I don't know where the fucking headphones are.

4029
04:44:09,619 --> 04:44:10,340
What is this clip?

4030
04:44:12,950 --> 04:44:13,669
Where are my headphones?

4031
04:44:14,310 --> 04:44:15,860
Where are my headphones?

4032
04:44:19,750 --> 04:44:20,790
Oh shit.

4033
04:44:20,790 --> 04:44:21,990
That's an Xbox controller.

4034
04:44:21,990 --> 04:44:22,310
Fuck it.

4035
04:44:22,310 --> 04:44:22,709
I'm curious.

4036
04:44:22,709 --> 04:44:23,430
Xbox sucks.

4037
04:44:24,310 --> 04:44:28,680
What is this clip?

4038
04:44:47,810 --> 04:44:49,569
Look at this tiny table.

4039
04:44:49,569 --> 04:44:53,250
That's like the little wood table from the living room.

4040
04:44:53,250 --> 04:44:56,709
Is that what he's trying to build the Labo on?

4041
04:44:59,779 --> 04:45:00,099
Yes.

4042
04:45:03,459 --> 04:45:04,259
Yes.

4043
04:45:04,259 --> 04:45:04,900
Yes, I am.

4044
04:45:05,459 --> 04:45:13,799
Whatever.

4045
04:45:14,599 --> 04:45:15,319
It's so small.

4046
04:45:17,639 --> 04:45:19,240
We talked about it before I started streaming.

4047
04:45:19,240 --> 04:45:19,880
It was like, I don't know.

4048
04:45:19,880 --> 04:45:21,240
Where the fuck am I going to build this?

4049
04:45:23,700 --> 04:45:34,580
This is what Joel said?

4050
04:45:34,580 --> 04:45:35,860
What did Joel say?

4051
04:45:36,580 --> 04:45:40,419
Another incredibly talented fucking live streamer.

4052
04:45:49,009 --> 04:45:50,049
Thanks for letting me know.

4053
04:45:50,049 --> 04:45:52,610
I really appreciate hearing about Germa, but could you chill out?

4054
04:45:54,439 --> 04:45:54,840
Thank you.

4055
04:46:09,040 --> 04:46:10,159
Joel got like mad.

4056
04:46:10,959 --> 04:46:13,840
Don't fuck with people if they don't want it.

4057
04:46:14,869 --> 04:46:17,909
He's a fucking funny like really good streamer.

4058
04:46:17,909 --> 04:46:20,069
Don't like make him pissed off.

4059
04:46:24,049 --> 04:46:26,290
Like don't like harass other people.

4060
04:46:27,490 --> 04:46:29,569
If they're like Charlie's into it.

4061
04:46:29,569 --> 04:46:30,849
It's Alex is into it.

4062
04:46:30,849 --> 04:46:32,529
Like if they're not just leave him alone.

4063
04:46:34,200 --> 04:46:36,680
He's he doesn't know the fuck is going on.

4064
04:46:40,209 --> 04:46:41,169
Joel's angry.

4065
04:46:43,319 --> 04:46:44,200
No, he sees it.

4066
04:46:44,200 --> 04:46:44,599
It's fine.

4067
04:46:44,599 --> 04:46:45,000
He's fine.

4068
04:46:47,409 --> 04:46:49,889
But don't just spam other people.

4069
04:46:50,529 --> 04:46:51,349
Please.

4070
04:46:53,520 --> 04:46:55,759
Oh, the the the me and Charlie and me and italics.

4071
04:46:55,759 --> 04:46:58,000
Yeah, that's definitely like for fun and everything.

4072
04:46:58,000 --> 04:47:02,880
But if Joel is trying to run a stream, don't like don't fuck with him.

4073
04:47:02,880 --> 04:47:04,000
It doesn't deserve it.

4074
04:47:04,560 --> 04:47:05,919
He's fucking a great guy.

4075
04:47:05,919 --> 04:47:08,240
So yes, they probably know what's going on.

4076
04:47:14,209 --> 04:47:17,490
But I have no idea what's going on here.

4077
04:47:23,540 --> 04:47:25,779
So Charlie and italics aren't great guys.

4078
04:47:25,779 --> 04:47:26,580
That's not what I said.

4079
04:47:27,220 --> 04:47:31,599
Just don't go after some random person.

4080
04:47:32,319 --> 04:47:34,580
We haven't we haven't I'm having fun.

4081
04:47:34,580 --> 04:47:35,220
You're having fun.

4082
04:47:36,180 --> 04:47:37,619
Charlie's having a lot of fun.

4083
04:47:37,619 --> 04:47:40,419
Charlie's having a lot of fun.

4084
04:47:40,419 --> 04:47:43,299
But like Joel had nothing to do with this at all.

4085
04:47:43,299 --> 04:47:46,259
Like he's just trying to run his broadcast.

4086
04:47:46,259 --> 04:47:48,099
Like don't don't like fuck with him.

4087
04:47:48,099 --> 04:47:48,500
You know what I mean?

4088
04:47:52,849 --> 04:47:53,569
Where are we here?

4089
04:48:02,340 --> 04:48:04,099
No, I have a lot of respect for Joel.

4090
04:48:04,099 --> 04:48:06,020
Like please don't get me wrong here.

4091
04:48:06,900 --> 04:48:09,540
I think he's one of the better streamers on Twitch.

4092
04:48:10,180 --> 04:48:12,180
There you go.

4093
04:48:14,790 --> 04:48:16,709
Uh rubber band two.

4094
04:48:16,709 --> 04:48:17,430
Sure.

4095
04:48:17,430 --> 04:48:25,270
I did that one.

4096
04:48:25,270 --> 04:48:26,229
Do how many?

4097
04:48:26,229 --> 04:48:27,189
What do I do?

4098
04:48:27,189 --> 04:48:31,009
Both sides.

4099
04:48:35,270 --> 04:48:37,110
Is RT game gonna get a shout out?

4100
04:48:37,110 --> 04:48:38,310
RT game is fucking awesome.

4101
04:48:39,959 --> 04:48:42,919
Literally the dude's blowing the fuck up like crazy.

4102
04:48:43,720 --> 04:48:45,840
Good for you, man.

4103
04:48:45,840 --> 04:48:46,720
For real.

4104
04:48:46,720 --> 04:48:49,750
I hope you're having a great fucking time.

4105
04:48:49,750 --> 04:48:53,000
It's a good fucking dude.

4106
04:48:54,630 --> 04:48:54,869
All right.

4107
04:48:54,869 --> 04:48:55,430
What do we got?

4108
04:48:58,959 --> 04:49:00,799
Same deal around the sides here.

4109
04:49:00,799 --> 04:49:02,159
Okay, okay.

4110
04:49:10,040 --> 04:49:10,520
I did it.

4111
04:49:15,220 --> 04:49:16,419
I finally did it.

4112
04:49:23,810 --> 04:49:25,810
We've been talking about dog smell.

4113
04:49:25,810 --> 04:49:26,450
We have not.

4114
04:49:26,450 --> 04:49:28,049
We invaded people's dreams.

4115
04:49:32,790 --> 04:49:38,180
Let's roll down.

4116
04:49:38,180 --> 04:49:39,540
This one is too, right?

4117
04:49:39,540 --> 04:49:40,180
Get it in there.

4118
04:49:40,819 --> 04:49:42,470
That doesn't want to stay.

4119
04:49:49,680 --> 04:49:53,040
A grown man has done something a child could do in 20 minutes.

4120
04:49:53,759 --> 04:49:56,000
He also invaded fucking critical.

4121
04:49:56,000 --> 04:49:58,279
What's he saying now?

4122
04:49:58,919 --> 04:50:00,599
No, don't.

4123
04:50:00,599 --> 04:50:02,360
He's, everything's, he's fine.

4124
04:50:09,889 --> 04:50:11,889
Joel, is Joel actually mad?

4125
04:50:11,889 --> 04:50:12,689
I hope he's not.

4126
04:50:12,689 --> 04:50:13,409
I really hope not.

4127
04:50:14,049 --> 04:50:22,340
I fucking hope not.

4128
04:50:22,340 --> 04:50:23,139
Is he actually?

4129
04:50:25,619 --> 04:50:26,979
No, don't fucking say that.

4130
04:50:28,240 --> 04:50:29,360
He seems mad.

4131
04:50:29,360 --> 04:50:30,400
Fucking goddammit.

4132
04:50:30,400 --> 04:50:31,360
Don't do that.

4133
04:50:34,610 --> 04:50:35,169
Yeah, he is.

4134
04:50:35,729 --> 04:50:40,639
I hope not.

4135
04:50:40,639 --> 04:50:42,930
Like, support his stream.

4136
04:50:42,930 --> 04:50:43,970
Don't fuck with it.

4137
04:50:43,970 --> 04:50:44,529
You know what I mean?

4138
04:50:44,529 --> 04:50:45,490
Like, please, guys.

4139
04:50:45,490 --> 04:50:45,889
For real.

4140
04:50:57,669 --> 04:50:58,950
He's having tech, okay.

4141
04:50:58,950 --> 04:51:00,229
Well, that's a different story then.

4142
04:51:00,869 --> 04:51:03,729
He seemed mad about stuff beforehand.

4143
04:51:04,450 --> 04:51:06,200
Chats just trolling.

4144
04:51:06,200 --> 04:51:07,080
Don't, please.

4145
04:51:07,080 --> 04:51:07,720
Come on, guys.

4146
04:51:07,720 --> 04:51:12,560
Like, he's, he's actually a really fucking good streamer.

4147
04:51:12,560 --> 04:51:15,919
Don't like, don't put this bullshit on him.

4148
04:51:15,919 --> 04:51:16,319
You know what I mean?

4149
04:51:17,279 --> 04:51:22,400
He thought chat spam was malicious.

4150
04:51:22,400 --> 04:51:23,520
I hope, I hope he doesn't think that.

4151
04:51:23,520 --> 04:51:23,919
For real.

4152
04:51:27,810 --> 04:51:29,569
Well, Joel, if you see this clip,

4153
04:51:30,209 --> 04:51:31,409
I hope you don't think that.

4154
04:51:31,409 --> 04:51:33,810
Because we were just having a good time.

4155
04:51:33,810 --> 04:51:34,849
I'm sorry, man.

4156
04:51:34,849 --> 04:51:36,610
I'm actually really sorry about that.

4157
04:51:37,330 --> 04:51:41,319
He knows.

4158
04:51:42,419 --> 04:51:42,740
Okay.

4159
04:51:57,509 --> 04:51:57,830
Okay.

4160
04:51:58,549 --> 04:52:00,709
So he's having like actual technical issues.

4161
04:52:00,709 --> 04:52:01,029
All right.

4162
04:52:02,849 --> 04:52:03,970
I don't want to piss people off.

4163
04:52:04,930 --> 04:52:06,930
I like, respect everything he does.

4164
04:52:06,930 --> 04:52:08,770
So like, I really hope that's not the case.

4165
04:52:09,810 --> 04:52:10,209
All right.

4166
04:52:10,209 --> 04:52:11,250
Pinch these two together.

4167
04:52:11,250 --> 04:52:12,369
Get off of that and get on this.

4168
04:52:21,139 --> 04:52:22,020
The levers are done.

4169
04:52:27,590 --> 04:52:27,830
All right.

4170
04:52:27,830 --> 04:52:28,549
We need E.

4171
04:52:30,849 --> 04:52:31,090
E.

4172
04:52:31,650 --> 04:52:36,740
Oh, what have we got for E?

4173
04:52:42,919 --> 04:52:43,400
I don't know.

4174
04:52:45,430 --> 04:52:45,909
E.

4175
04:52:45,909 --> 04:52:47,590
Get, why do I have these in my ears?

4176
04:52:47,590 --> 04:52:48,549
I'm not listening to anything.

4177
04:52:52,209 --> 04:52:52,930
F.

4178
04:52:52,930 --> 04:52:53,810
This is E.

4179
04:52:55,169 --> 04:53:05,750
Where the fuck is E?

4180
04:53:09,299 --> 04:53:09,619
I.

4181
04:53:10,500 --> 04:53:10,740
J.

4182
04:53:18,259 --> 04:53:18,500
E.

4183
04:53:20,319 --> 04:53:20,560
C.

4184
04:53:25,490 --> 04:53:25,729
A.

4185
04:53:26,689 --> 04:53:30,470
Oh shit.

4186
04:53:30,470 --> 04:53:31,029
Is this E?

4187
04:53:35,430 --> 04:53:36,950
This looks like, yeah.

4188
04:53:36,950 --> 04:53:37,669
This is part of it.

4189
04:53:43,299 --> 04:53:44,180
But we had our fun.

4190
04:53:46,759 --> 04:53:49,720
Uh, I would reiterate this one more time.

4191
04:53:49,720 --> 04:53:52,279
Our fun does not need to bleed into somebody else's stream.

4192
04:53:54,369 --> 04:53:56,130
Let them do what they want to do.

4193
04:53:56,130 --> 04:53:56,369
Right?

4194
04:54:01,279 --> 04:54:02,560
Where's the other half?

4195
04:54:02,560 --> 04:54:11,889
There it is.

4196
04:54:11,889 --> 04:54:15,569
Can you re-

4197
04:54:15,569 --> 04:54:16,209
I didn't have any fun.

4198
04:54:16,209 --> 04:54:17,009
Can you rewind?

4199
04:54:17,569 --> 04:54:31,840
That's it, right?

4200
04:54:31,840 --> 04:54:32,080
Okay.

4201
04:54:35,090 --> 04:54:35,409
All right.

4202
04:54:35,970 --> 04:54:41,409
Uh, this is done.

4203
04:54:41,409 --> 04:54:42,369
This moves over here.

4204
04:54:46,709 --> 04:54:47,750
Internet sucks.

4205
04:54:48,470 --> 04:54:51,029
It's been pretty stable, I think, for a while now, at least.

4206
04:54:51,750 --> 04:54:56,119
Let's go.

4207
04:54:57,380 --> 04:55:09,830
Ah, I'm going to piss my pants, though, for real.

4208
04:55:10,470 --> 04:55:11,599
I'm going to go pee.

4209
04:55:12,720 --> 04:55:15,200
Uh, I'll be back in like two minutes.

4210
04:55:32,259 --> 04:57:13,880
Hello?

4211
04:57:13,880 --> 04:57:18,959
That needs to come back.

4212
04:57:22,720 --> 04:57:22,959
Okay.

4213
04:57:25,970 --> 04:57:26,689
All right.

4214
04:57:26,689 --> 04:57:28,529
So I've got these pieces now.

4215
04:57:29,169 --> 04:57:39,360
It was actually two minutes.

4216
04:57:39,360 --> 04:57:39,919
I know, right?

4217
04:57:41,220 --> 04:57:41,700
Pretty good.

4218
04:57:45,000 --> 04:57:46,279
I got to get all this shit out of here.

4219
04:57:46,279 --> 04:57:47,400
There's some of these little knobs.

4220
04:57:56,200 --> 04:57:58,200
Get the fucking vacuum in here.

4221
04:57:59,000 --> 04:58:19,169
Why won't you come out?

4222
04:58:20,119 --> 04:58:21,400
What are you doing?

4223
04:58:21,400 --> 04:58:21,880
Why?

4224
04:58:21,880 --> 04:58:22,599
It's broken.

4225
04:58:26,020 --> 04:58:26,259
All right.

4226
04:58:26,259 --> 04:58:27,139
Relax, Jeremy.

4227
04:58:27,139 --> 04:58:27,540
You're fine.

4228
04:58:29,830 --> 04:58:33,430
I'm so fucking goddamn invested in this labo.

4229
04:58:33,430 --> 04:58:33,909
Me too.

4230
04:58:34,709 --> 04:58:36,310
It was 80 bucks.

4231
04:58:36,310 --> 04:58:47,599
So I better be so expensive.

4232
04:58:47,599 --> 04:58:57,430
80 bucks for cardboard.

4233
04:58:57,430 --> 04:59:04,259
All right.

4234
04:59:04,259 --> 04:59:04,580
We've got-

4235
04:59:07,270 --> 04:59:14,680
No, they're good.

4236
04:59:17,159 --> 04:59:18,279
Scuffed labo.

4237
04:59:19,000 --> 04:59:33,189
All right.

4238
04:59:33,189 --> 04:59:34,869
So this rolls over.

4239
04:59:38,389 --> 04:59:39,990
So roll, roll.

4240
04:59:39,990 --> 04:59:43,029
And then this comes down and these pieces go in.

4241
04:59:45,189 --> 04:59:45,669
Damn.

4242
04:59:46,880 --> 04:59:47,599
This is tight.

4243
04:59:58,880 --> 05:00:00,159
I spent money on this?

4244
05:00:01,040 --> 05:00:01,279
Yeah.

4245
05:00:02,900 --> 05:00:04,099
Fucking labo, dude.

4246
05:00:04,099 --> 05:00:04,659
Give me a break.

4247
05:00:11,439 --> 05:00:12,400
Where does this go?

4248
05:00:12,400 --> 05:00:12,639
What?

4249
05:00:13,200 --> 05:00:18,740
This goes across.

4250
05:00:20,099 --> 05:00:20,740
Like that?

4251
05:00:21,880 --> 05:00:22,759
Like that's it.

4252
05:00:23,400 --> 05:00:23,720
Okay.

4253
05:00:29,509 --> 05:00:30,069
I folded this.

4254
05:00:30,069 --> 05:00:31,349
That was a mistake, apparently.

4255
05:00:33,200 --> 05:00:33,680
That's okay.

4256
05:00:33,680 --> 05:00:34,159
It looks fine.

4257
05:00:38,919 --> 05:00:41,240
You spent 80 and made a thousand.

4258
05:00:41,720 --> 05:00:50,180
I can't fucking believe it.

4259
05:00:51,380 --> 05:00:52,500
People are so generous.

4260
05:00:52,500 --> 05:00:53,860
I don't even understand.

4261
05:00:54,659 --> 05:00:57,590
Just go to the green screen stream.

4262
05:00:57,590 --> 05:00:59,189
Maybe that'll be worth money.

4263
05:00:59,189 --> 05:01:05,240
All right.

4264
05:01:05,240 --> 05:01:06,680
Don't fold these.

4265
05:01:06,680 --> 05:01:07,240
Fold this.

4266
05:01:08,740 --> 05:01:09,139
Damn.

4267
05:01:09,700 --> 05:01:21,400
This part down.

4268
05:01:21,400 --> 05:01:22,919
Oh, it kind of crunches.

4269
05:01:28,959 --> 05:01:31,279
You know, I can sound like a broken record all I want,

4270
05:01:31,279 --> 05:01:37,090
but if you don't think this stream is worth paying for,

4271
05:01:37,090 --> 05:01:38,130
don't pay for it.

4272
05:01:40,709 --> 05:01:41,430
If you're like,

4273
05:01:41,430 --> 05:01:43,509
no, this ain't worth fucking $5 a month.

4274
05:01:44,319 --> 05:01:44,880
Don't do it.

4275
05:01:45,439 --> 05:01:46,799
I respect it.

4276
05:01:49,000 --> 05:01:49,479
Let's go.

4277
05:02:00,479 --> 05:02:03,889
How do you pirate the stream?

4278
05:02:06,130 --> 05:02:07,509
You just open it.

4279
05:02:12,130 --> 05:02:12,849
Same deal.

4280
05:02:12,849 --> 05:02:13,409
Fold it up.

4281
05:02:14,130 --> 05:02:15,009
Put it together.

4282
05:02:16,049 --> 05:02:17,009
Slot into slot.

4283
05:02:20,049 --> 05:02:22,369
I will never have a sub goal for you guys.

4284
05:02:22,369 --> 05:02:23,650
I'll never have a bit goal.

4285
05:02:23,650 --> 05:02:25,330
I never tell you guys you need to pay money.

4286
05:02:25,330 --> 05:02:27,169
I'll never tell you guys I need you to pay me.

4287
05:02:28,529 --> 05:02:30,290
If you think it was worth it,

4288
05:02:30,290 --> 05:02:31,810
that's a decision that you need to make.

4289
05:02:32,689 --> 05:02:34,040
I'm not going to make it for you.

4290
05:02:34,520 --> 05:02:35,720
I'm not going to make it for you.

4291
05:02:35,720 --> 05:02:54,799
You wouldn't pirate a stream.

4292
05:02:55,599 --> 05:03:00,360
This thing needs to flip around.

4293
05:03:01,000 --> 05:03:04,419
More merchandise.

4294
05:03:04,419 --> 05:03:05,220
I talked about it before.

4295
05:03:05,220 --> 05:03:07,220
There'll be two t-shirts that will be available

4296
05:03:07,220 --> 05:03:09,700
to purchase for the first time since 2014.

4297
05:03:11,060 --> 05:03:12,659
The glue man shirt will be coming back

4298
05:03:13,840 --> 05:03:15,840
as well as a planet shirt.

4299
05:03:17,110 --> 05:03:19,830
A solar system shirt will be available as well.

4300
05:03:19,830 --> 05:03:20,630
It'll be a new shirt.

4301
05:03:22,310 --> 05:03:24,389
If you want it, it'll be 20 bucks.

4302
05:03:24,389 --> 05:03:25,909
It'll never be more than that ever.

4303
05:03:26,709 --> 05:03:29,189
I will never charge more than $20 for a shirt

4304
05:03:29,189 --> 05:03:32,229
for any fucking circumstance literally ever.

4305
05:03:34,450 --> 05:03:35,810
And that's the way it is.

4306
05:03:35,810 --> 05:03:37,409
It'll be there probably in December.

4307
05:03:37,409 --> 05:03:38,770
Probably around Christmas time.

4308
05:03:39,490 --> 05:03:44,689
What about inflation?

4309
05:03:45,250 --> 05:03:55,009
Whatever.

4310
05:03:55,009 --> 05:03:56,369
That's a little nub.

4311
05:03:57,169 --> 05:03:57,669
Damn.

4312
05:03:58,450 --> 05:04:00,400
What about tax?

4313
05:04:01,840 --> 05:04:03,599
That's why I want to make it $20 only.

4314
05:04:04,240 --> 05:04:05,520
Flip it around.

4315
05:04:05,520 --> 05:04:06,479
Flip it all up.

4316
05:04:06,479 --> 05:04:07,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4317
05:04:07,119 --> 05:04:07,759
It looks good.

4318
05:04:14,659 --> 05:04:16,819
It'll be on Teespring if you're curious.

4319
05:04:19,840 --> 05:04:22,000
I got business marks releasing during Christmas.

4320
05:04:22,000 --> 05:04:22,880
Well, I figured it's a...

4321
05:04:23,919 --> 05:04:26,159
I did it like three years ago at the same time.

4322
05:04:26,159 --> 05:04:33,110
So can I pay you in cardboard?

4323
05:04:33,110 --> 05:04:34,389
No, unfortunately, no.

4324
05:04:35,029 --> 05:04:38,580
Get the first straw ready to go.

4325
05:04:38,580 --> 05:04:39,619
Big old robot hug.

4326
05:04:39,619 --> 05:04:41,540
The straw line should face like you see on the screen.

4327
05:04:41,540 --> 05:04:42,099
Like this.

4328
05:04:43,299 --> 05:04:44,500
Look at that.

4329
05:04:46,869 --> 05:04:47,430
Not down.

4330
05:04:54,040 --> 05:04:57,959
So does it go straight through this slot here?

4331
05:04:59,159 --> 05:05:00,040
Okay.

4332
05:05:00,040 --> 05:05:00,439
Then what?

4333
05:05:05,970 --> 05:05:06,529
All the way?

4334
05:05:06,529 --> 05:05:07,029
Okay.

4335
05:05:08,790 --> 05:05:09,270
Okay.

4336
05:05:09,270 --> 05:05:10,150
You told me to do it.

4337
05:05:10,790 --> 05:05:14,849
Put the shirts on the EU site as well.

4338
05:05:15,889 --> 05:05:17,970
That's why I will never have a shirt more than $20.

4339
05:05:19,490 --> 05:05:23,569
Because it's crazy to ship internationally.

4340
05:05:24,819 --> 05:05:26,819
So if a shirt is like 30 bucks,

4341
05:05:28,450 --> 05:05:31,409
you're getting fucking screwed during the shipping process.

4342
05:05:31,409 --> 05:05:33,970
So those of you that are at EU,

4343
05:05:33,970 --> 05:05:35,650
a shirt will never be more than $20.

4344
05:05:35,650 --> 05:05:37,810
So if you get fucked in shipping,

4345
05:05:37,810 --> 05:05:40,529
it's not going to be, you know, super, super terrible.

4346
05:05:41,330 --> 05:05:45,009
Okay.

4347
05:05:45,009 --> 05:05:45,810
It's in the right spot.

4348
05:05:45,810 --> 05:05:46,290
Here it is.

4349
05:05:48,840 --> 05:05:49,720
So this has to...

4350
05:05:49,720 --> 05:05:50,439
Wait, wait, wait.

4351
05:05:50,439 --> 05:05:53,240
This comes up and around like this.

4352
05:05:54,200 --> 05:05:58,400
This goes down and in?

4353
05:05:58,959 --> 05:05:59,360
Damn.

4354
05:06:00,159 --> 05:06:00,659
Okay.

4355
05:06:01,860 --> 05:06:10,240
Dreadful diapers?

4356
05:06:11,439 --> 05:06:12,880
I don't think this would sell very well.

4357
05:06:13,599 --> 05:06:16,849
Cross them down.

4358
05:06:16,849 --> 05:06:17,729
Mine looks fucked up.

4359
05:06:25,090 --> 05:06:27,490
No, I have the opinion of

4360
05:06:27,490 --> 05:06:29,569
if you were to go to any store

4361
05:06:29,569 --> 05:06:31,409
and buy like a Star Wars shirt,

4362
05:06:32,369 --> 05:06:33,409
which is arguably...

4363
05:06:34,450 --> 05:06:36,529
And arguably this is just for real.

4364
05:06:38,369 --> 05:06:39,009
That shit is...

4365
05:06:39,650 --> 05:06:42,930
That franchise is worth like hundreds of millions of dollars.

4366
05:06:44,950 --> 05:06:46,790
And those t-shirts are like 15 bucks.

4367
05:06:48,770 --> 05:06:51,970
Me selling a German 985 shirt for like $32?

4368
05:06:55,000 --> 05:06:55,479
No.

4369
05:06:55,479 --> 05:06:56,200
No fucking way.

4370
05:06:56,919 --> 05:07:01,009
Not even close.

4371
05:07:04,290 --> 05:07:04,849
That looks good.

4372
05:07:05,650 --> 05:07:09,060
All right.

4373
05:07:09,060 --> 05:07:10,180
You'd buy it for $40.

4374
05:07:10,740 --> 05:07:11,939
Even if you would, it doesn't...

4375
05:07:11,939 --> 05:07:12,500
I don't care.

4376
05:07:12,500 --> 05:07:14,819
I'm not selling a shirt for more than fucking 20 bucks ever.

4377
05:07:15,380 --> 05:07:18,310
That's a huge amount of money.

4378
05:07:18,310 --> 05:07:20,069
$50 from Swiggity Swanky.

4379
05:07:22,360 --> 05:07:24,119
I just got back from a long day at work

4380
05:07:24,119 --> 05:07:26,840
and had to walk an extra three miles

4381
05:07:27,799 --> 05:07:29,479
home after my car died.

4382
05:07:30,040 --> 05:07:32,549
And now I find you doing this.

4383
05:07:33,889 --> 05:07:35,250
You're my favorite streamer on Twitch.

4384
05:07:36,549 --> 05:07:38,310
I hope you got your car situation taken care of

4385
05:07:38,310 --> 05:07:39,029
because that sucks.

4386
05:07:40,560 --> 05:07:41,599
Holy shit, dude.

4387
05:07:41,599 --> 05:07:43,759
Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, man.

4388
05:07:44,479 --> 05:07:47,810
It's a lot of money.

4389
05:07:49,520 --> 05:07:49,840
Thank you.

4390
05:07:51,250 --> 05:07:52,689
Hopefully your car is all right.

4391
05:07:54,400 --> 05:07:56,159
Hey, we're building a car right now.

4392
05:07:56,799 --> 05:07:57,939
Maybe you can use it.

4393
05:08:01,860 --> 05:08:03,220
Thank you so much, dude.

4394
05:08:03,220 --> 05:08:05,540
50 fucking bucks and you're having like car trouble.

4395
05:08:05,540 --> 05:08:07,220
Please help me take care of yourself first

4396
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:10,000
because that's a lot of money.

4397
05:08:12,159 --> 05:08:19,270
But yeah, I don't just do merch for no reason.

4398
05:08:21,939 --> 05:08:24,819
If it's fun, if it makes sense, sure.

4399
05:08:31,750 --> 05:08:31,990
All right.

4400
05:08:31,990 --> 05:08:33,110
You thought you were done.

4401
05:08:33,110 --> 05:08:33,830
Flip this piece over.

4402
05:08:34,790 --> 05:08:35,270
Which one?

4403
05:08:43,169 --> 05:08:44,610
But multi-billion dollar companies

4404
05:08:44,610 --> 05:08:46,209
have an advantage of market penetration

4405
05:08:46,209 --> 05:08:47,250
and worth and width.

4406
05:08:48,049 --> 05:08:51,650
Economic status quo does not equate with real

4407
05:08:51,650 --> 05:08:54,290
or perceived value and any economist

4408
05:08:55,169 --> 05:08:56,689
that tells you otherwise can't see that.

4409
05:08:57,409 --> 05:08:58,610
You're blowing my brain here.

4410
05:09:14,200 --> 05:09:16,759
No, I think 20, 25 dollars is asking a lot.

4411
05:09:17,400 --> 05:09:18,119
It's a lot of money.

4412
05:09:20,159 --> 05:09:21,599
25 bucks for a t-shirt.

4413
05:09:22,560 --> 05:09:24,560
That's the kind of money you spend on

4414
05:09:28,880 --> 05:09:29,919
like a band t-shirt.

4415
05:09:29,919 --> 05:09:31,840
Am I like as popular as a band?

4416
05:09:33,490 --> 05:09:35,409
No, I mean, I don't think so.

4417
05:09:37,810 --> 05:09:38,770
On drugs.

4418
05:09:39,409 --> 05:09:40,959
That's good.

4419
05:09:41,599 --> 05:09:46,290
This piece has to fold this way.

4420
05:09:47,009 --> 05:09:52,770
Wait, wait, wait.

4421
05:09:52,770 --> 05:09:55,090
Spin it so the hole is up this way.

4422
05:09:58,400 --> 05:09:59,599
Why is it telling me to do that now?

4423
05:10:00,319 --> 05:10:05,799
This is gonna break.

4424
05:10:09,159 --> 05:10:09,400
What?

4425
05:10:09,959 --> 05:10:10,880
All right.

4426
05:10:10,880 --> 05:10:11,680
That's it.

4427
05:10:11,680 --> 05:10:20,209
That's good.

4428
05:10:26,209 --> 05:10:26,689
Locked in.

4429
05:10:28,049 --> 05:10:30,529
The first straw has been powered up.

4430
05:10:30,529 --> 05:10:31,090
Good.

4431
05:10:31,090 --> 05:10:32,049
That's great.

4432
05:10:32,049 --> 05:10:38,340
Am I making Thor's hammer?

4433
05:10:38,340 --> 05:10:38,819
I wish.

4434
05:10:44,770 --> 05:10:47,090
You have more subs than Matt Keefe

4435
05:10:47,090 --> 05:10:49,250
from the band Trivium who's also a streamer.

4436
05:10:49,889 --> 05:10:52,950
Yeah, but why if that was the case

4437
05:10:52,950 --> 05:10:54,950
then why would I want to tell people

4438
05:10:54,950 --> 05:10:56,389
to spend a shitload of money on me?

4439
05:10:56,950 --> 05:10:57,430
You know what I mean?

4440
05:10:58,689 --> 05:11:00,049
If there are people that are spending

4441
05:11:00,049 --> 05:11:01,889
five dollars a month on this stream already.

4442
05:11:03,110 --> 05:11:04,549
Hey, oh, I got a t-shirt.

4443
05:11:04,549 --> 05:11:05,590
It's 32 bucks.

4444
05:11:06,229 --> 05:11:07,779
Bullshit.

4445
05:11:08,959 --> 05:11:21,270
I don't believe it.

4446
05:11:21,270 --> 05:11:23,029
Why did you pay more for German expensive?

4447
05:11:23,750 --> 05:11:33,189
Yeah, they all get folded.

4448
05:11:33,189 --> 05:11:33,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4449
05:11:34,470 --> 05:11:38,900
$20 is good for a t-shirt.

4450
05:11:38,900 --> 05:11:40,500
I agree and it'll never change.

4451
05:11:41,919 --> 05:11:44,479
If you ever see a t-shirt on this channel

4452
05:11:44,479 --> 05:11:48,819
that's more than $20, link this clip

4453
05:11:51,090 --> 05:11:52,450
and tell me to go fuck myself.

4454
05:11:53,090 --> 05:11:58,709
For real.

4455
05:11:58,709 --> 05:12:04,400
All right.

4456
05:12:04,400 --> 05:12:06,180
Does that include shipping?

4457
05:12:06,180 --> 05:12:07,139
It does not.

4458
05:12:07,139 --> 05:12:08,180
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

4459
05:12:16,919 --> 05:12:17,479
Same deal.

4460
05:12:17,479 --> 05:12:18,520
This goes like this.

4461
05:12:24,200 --> 05:12:25,639
Rapid inflation.

4462
05:12:25,639 --> 05:12:27,159
It's not that rapid.

4463
05:12:27,799 --> 05:12:29,560
Very true.

4464
05:12:30,439 --> 05:12:34,720
Did he comment on it at all?

4465
05:12:35,279 --> 05:12:35,919
Comment on what?

4466
05:12:39,090 --> 05:12:40,130
Did I comment on what?

4467
05:12:40,130 --> 05:12:40,770
What are you asking?

4468
05:12:41,409 --> 05:12:49,680
Did I comment on what?

4469
05:13:07,799 --> 05:13:09,159
Hyperinflation.

4470
05:13:09,159 --> 05:13:09,880
Whatever.

4471
05:13:09,880 --> 05:13:17,599
Wait, do I have this right?

4472
05:13:17,599 --> 05:13:20,290
I do.

4473
05:13:20,290 --> 05:13:23,270
Comes in like this, like that.

4474
05:13:23,270 --> 05:13:23,509
Okay.

4475
05:13:30,819 --> 05:13:32,740
Death Grips is an anime podcast.

4476
05:13:33,619 --> 05:13:35,880
Well, that would have got me maybe like a year ago

4477
05:13:35,880 --> 05:13:37,240
but I know what Death Grips is.

4478
05:13:38,119 --> 05:13:40,040
Although I don't really listen to their music.

4479
05:13:40,040 --> 05:13:42,279
I haven't really listened very much.

4480
05:13:43,240 --> 05:13:51,200
That's good.

4481
05:13:51,759 --> 05:14:03,159
Up and around and we are closed.

4482
05:14:03,159 --> 05:14:03,659
Done.

4483
05:14:05,139 --> 05:14:06,740
So why is this one different than this one?

4484
05:14:21,569 --> 05:14:24,130
But the shirt that you are talking about

4485
05:14:25,680 --> 05:14:27,200
is a planet shirt.

4486
05:14:27,840 --> 05:14:29,439
It'll be like right here.

4487
05:14:32,680 --> 05:14:34,360
All the planets or at least most of them

4488
05:14:34,360 --> 05:14:38,549
most of the ones people care about should be fine.

4489
05:14:49,250 --> 05:14:50,529
A limited number.

4490
05:14:50,529 --> 05:14:52,049
No, there's no limited number of shirts.

4491
05:14:52,689 --> 05:14:54,759
It'll be available for about a month.

4492
05:14:55,479 --> 05:14:56,419
Oh shit.

4493
05:14:59,909 --> 05:15:00,409
Uh-oh.

4494
05:15:00,889 --> 05:15:06,330
Uh, this is a real...

4495
05:15:06,330 --> 05:15:06,830
Uh-oh.

4496
05:15:17,159 --> 05:15:17,959
I don't know what that is.

4497
05:16:08,150 --> 05:16:08,869
Got it!

4498
05:16:08,869 --> 05:16:12,009
Italics, I got it!

4499
05:16:12,009 --> 05:16:18,819
So this is fold one.

4500
05:16:18,819 --> 05:16:22,439
It was in here.

4501
05:16:23,000 --> 05:16:27,619
Fuck off, dickhead.

4502
05:16:27,619 --> 05:16:36,979
All right.

4503
05:16:36,979 --> 05:16:38,659
Uh, looks good to go to me.

4504
05:16:41,270 --> 05:16:41,909
Oh shit.

4505
05:16:42,549 --> 05:16:43,509
No, that's not good.

4506
05:16:45,020 --> 05:16:45,659
That's not good.

4507
05:16:52,099 --> 05:16:54,659
It needs to be like this but shit.

4508
05:17:01,900 --> 05:17:02,220
That.

4509
05:17:02,220 --> 05:17:03,099
Okay, that's good.

4510
05:17:06,220 --> 05:17:08,939
The white blip needs to be up.

4511
05:17:08,939 --> 05:17:09,439
Got it.

4512
05:17:13,849 --> 05:17:15,290
Uh, favorite band is Gorillaz?

4513
05:17:15,290 --> 05:17:17,020
Yes, it is.

4514
05:17:17,020 --> 05:17:18,060
That is for sure.

4515
05:17:21,580 --> 05:17:32,180
I need them sticker sheets and things.

4516
05:17:32,180 --> 05:17:41,819
I dropped.

4517
05:17:41,819 --> 05:17:44,139
All right, I need, I need, I need some water.

4518
05:17:44,139 --> 05:18:10,889
What are we doing here?

4519
05:18:10,889 --> 05:18:26,279
This is not right.

4520
05:18:43,400 --> 05:18:44,119
Yeah, it is.

4521
05:18:44,119 --> 05:18:48,759
Okay.

4522
05:18:59,319 --> 05:19:06,819
Oh, I got two.

4523
05:19:06,819 --> 05:19:11,479
Okay, I got one here.

4524
05:19:11,479 --> 05:19:16,979
You want me to go above it?

4525
05:19:16,979 --> 05:19:19,049
What the fuck do you want?

4526
05:19:19,049 --> 05:19:20,439
What are you talking about?

4527
05:19:44,099 --> 05:19:44,599
Yes!

4528
05:20:35,740 --> 05:20:36,240
Yes!

4529
05:21:35,639 --> 05:21:36,759
I'm so good.

4530
05:21:36,759 --> 05:21:38,439
I'm so good at what I do.

4531
05:21:38,680 --> 05:23:08,330
Close it all up.

4532
05:23:08,330 --> 05:23:52,250
I'm, I can't talk.

4533
05:23:52,250 --> 05:23:52,970
I'm sorry, guys.

4534
05:23:52,970 --> 05:24:48,869
This is too much.

4535
05:24:48,869 --> 05:24:49,430
Yes!

4536
05:24:49,430 --> 05:25:34,599
I'm sorry.

4537
05:25:34,599 --> 05:25:35,240
Yes!

4538
05:25:35,240 --> 05:25:52,970
Can you not?

4539
05:25:52,970 --> 05:25:53,930
I'm sorry.

4540
05:25:53,930 --> 05:26:29,619
Stick it in.

4541
05:26:29,619 --> 05:26:30,900
Uh, which way does it go?

4542
05:26:30,900 --> 05:26:39,049
I'm so sorry, everybody.

4543
05:26:39,049 --> 05:26:42,779
I thought it was funny for five seconds.

4544
05:26:42,779 --> 05:26:56,409
That's it, right?

4545
05:26:56,970 --> 05:26:57,529
Looks good.

4546
05:27:03,799 --> 05:27:04,439
Cheat!

4547
05:27:04,439 --> 05:27:12,740
Fucking idiot.

4548
05:27:12,740 --> 05:27:28,310
Tiny table.

4549
05:27:40,919 --> 05:27:43,479
Jesus, there's a lot of fold lines here, Nintendo.

4550
05:27:57,049 --> 05:28:00,599
Somebody said italics is drunk?

4551
05:28:00,599 --> 05:28:01,799
Not my stream.

4552
05:28:01,799 --> 05:28:05,139
Good luck.

4553
05:28:05,139 --> 05:28:10,220
Nothing to do with me.

4554
05:28:11,990 --> 05:28:13,189
Somebody else's stream.

4555
05:28:13,189 --> 05:28:13,990
Not me.

4556
05:28:13,990 --> 05:28:28,229
If I had a pet rat, what would I name it?

4557
05:28:29,990 --> 05:28:33,130
Um, Grento.

4558
05:28:33,130 --> 05:28:43,500
What the fuck is this?

4559
05:28:53,139 --> 05:28:53,700
Stubbier?

4560
05:28:56,939 --> 05:29:00,810
Stick it into here.

4561
05:29:00,810 --> 05:29:01,930
Fuck off, Nintendo.

4562
05:29:02,569 --> 05:29:03,209
Be a break.

4563
05:29:05,290 --> 05:29:19,479
What?

4564
05:29:19,479 --> 05:29:19,959
I give up.

4565
05:29:19,959 --> 05:29:20,759
I'm going to bed.

4566
05:29:20,759 --> 05:29:22,119
I'm going, I'm going to bed.

4567
05:29:22,119 --> 05:29:22,759
Good night.

4568
05:29:22,759 --> 05:29:46,759
I lost viewers.

4569
05:29:46,759 --> 05:29:47,479
No, I did not.

4570
05:29:47,479 --> 05:29:48,360
Don't say that.

4571
05:29:48,360 --> 05:29:49,770
No, I did.

4572
05:29:49,770 --> 05:30:08,169
Getting late.

4573
05:30:08,169 --> 05:30:16,229
It's like fucking 9, 10.

4574
05:30:16,229 --> 05:30:18,470
It's 1130 Eastern, guys.

4575
05:30:18,470 --> 05:30:19,619
I get it.

4576
05:30:19,619 --> 05:30:20,659
You want to go to bed.

4577
05:30:20,659 --> 05:30:21,779
Don't worry about it.

4578
05:30:21,779 --> 05:30:24,729
I'm not going to bed till this is done.

4579
05:30:25,130 --> 05:30:29,750
Fuck you.

4580
05:30:34,900 --> 05:30:45,020
It's supposed to look like that.

4581
05:30:47,610 --> 05:30:48,970
I don't think it's supposed to look like that.

4582
05:30:51,099 --> 05:30:51,979
No, I guess it is.

4583
05:31:03,130 --> 05:31:03,610
No, it is.

4584
05:31:04,250 --> 05:31:05,209
It looks like that.

4585
05:31:08,279 --> 05:31:10,040
It's 830 in Vegas.

4586
05:31:10,040 --> 05:31:10,599
Yes, it is.

4587
05:31:11,159 --> 05:31:13,159
But it's like fucking midnight Eastern.

4588
05:31:13,159 --> 05:31:15,240
That's a lot of people go on Eastern time, man.

4589
05:31:18,700 --> 05:31:21,259
Eastern is the time people go on.

4590
05:31:21,259 --> 05:31:27,860
It's a fucking red blend, man.

4591
05:31:28,580 --> 05:31:42,090
Lost of viewers.

4592
05:31:42,970 --> 05:31:43,770
It's all right, though.

4593
05:31:43,770 --> 05:31:44,250
I get it.

4594
05:31:45,610 --> 05:31:46,250
I get it.

4595
05:31:46,250 --> 05:31:46,569
I do.

4596
05:31:47,290 --> 05:31:48,630
Don't worry about it.

4597
05:31:49,270 --> 05:31:51,930
It's not about the viewer count.

4598
05:31:52,889 --> 05:31:54,889
It's about how much fun you guys are having.

4599
05:31:56,310 --> 05:31:56,869
It's all good.

4600
05:31:59,580 --> 05:32:01,099
If you're not having fun and you leave,

4601
05:32:01,979 --> 05:32:03,500
I'll see you next time.

4602
05:32:03,500 --> 05:32:04,220
I'll try better.

4603
05:32:04,860 --> 05:32:05,740
I'll try harder.

4604
05:32:07,419 --> 05:32:07,740
All right.

4605
05:32:10,069 --> 05:32:10,389
Done.

4606
05:32:18,009 --> 05:32:18,889
Using money.

4607
05:32:19,450 --> 05:32:22,580
That looks okay.

4608
05:32:23,139 --> 05:32:29,560
That doesn't look right.

4609
05:32:30,200 --> 05:32:45,450
Yeah, it does.

4610
05:32:48,950 --> 05:32:49,509
Yeah, it does.

4611
05:32:51,770 --> 05:32:52,330
Right.

4612
05:32:52,330 --> 05:33:04,020
That's correct.

4613
05:33:04,580 --> 05:33:10,779
All right.

4614
05:33:10,779 --> 05:33:12,229
Put it in the engine.

4615
05:33:12,229 --> 05:33:12,549
Whoa.

4616
05:33:13,189 --> 05:33:22,409
Put it into a V.

4617
05:33:22,409 --> 05:33:30,099
And then what the fuck?

4618
05:33:30,099 --> 05:33:30,979
I can't.

4619
05:33:30,979 --> 05:33:31,700
I'm going to bed.

4620
05:33:31,700 --> 05:33:32,500
Good night.

4621
05:33:32,500 --> 05:33:34,759
No, I'm just kidding.

4622
05:33:34,759 --> 05:33:36,779
We're going till we're done.

4623
05:33:56,650 --> 05:34:15,860
That's it?

4624
05:34:27,770 --> 05:34:28,009
G.

4625
05:34:28,729 --> 05:34:38,090
I need a G.

4626
05:34:38,090 --> 05:34:38,650
G.

4627
05:34:38,650 --> 05:34:45,619
Got it.

4628
05:34:46,180 --> 05:34:47,060
Relax.

4629
05:34:47,060 --> 05:35:07,590
All right.

4630
05:35:07,590 --> 05:35:11,000
Let's go.

4631
05:35:11,000 --> 05:35:11,880
Losing viewers.

4632
05:35:12,439 --> 05:35:13,080
Oh, well.

4633
05:35:13,080 --> 05:35:15,610
We tried.

4634
05:35:15,610 --> 05:35:16,009
All right.

4635
05:35:16,009 --> 05:35:19,720
Here we go.

4636
05:35:19,720 --> 05:35:23,400
Apparently, it tells the Toy-Con key which Toy-Con it's inside.

4637
05:35:32,409 --> 05:35:33,450
Viewers went up a bit.

4638
05:35:34,169 --> 05:35:38,979
I hope you guys are having fun.

4639
05:35:38,979 --> 05:35:45,659
Oh, what is this bullshit?

4640
05:35:45,659 --> 05:35:45,979
What?

4641
05:35:45,979 --> 05:35:46,459
Where is the?

4642
05:35:46,459 --> 05:35:48,540
I don't know what that is.

4643
05:35:48,540 --> 05:35:50,139
That's the fucking tar stuff.

4644
05:35:50,139 --> 05:35:50,619
Where's the?

4645
05:35:54,180 --> 05:35:55,540
Ow, my face.

4646
05:35:56,180 --> 05:35:58,569
The big square.

4647
05:36:06,700 --> 05:36:07,180
All right.

4648
05:36:07,180 --> 05:36:07,819
I can't.

4649
05:36:07,819 --> 05:36:09,270
I can't do it.

4650
05:36:09,270 --> 05:36:09,750
I can't.

4651
05:36:09,750 --> 05:36:11,029
I don't think I can do it.

4652
05:36:11,029 --> 05:36:11,430
Okay.

4653
05:36:11,430 --> 05:36:11,990
Right here?

4654
05:36:11,990 --> 05:36:24,790
I think Jerm is drunk.

4655
05:36:24,790 --> 05:36:26,470
I think Jerm might be too drunk to do it.

4656
05:36:26,470 --> 05:36:29,270
I think Jerm might be too drunk to do a perfect fucking square.

4657
05:36:29,270 --> 05:36:31,509
I think Jerm is too drunk to do a perfect fucking square.

4658
05:36:49,779 --> 05:36:50,500
I can?

4659
05:36:50,500 --> 05:36:57,400
Where does this dumb thing go?

4660
05:37:00,520 --> 05:37:01,319
Let him have it.

4661
05:37:08,439 --> 05:37:09,319
This is cool.

4662
05:37:09,880 --> 05:37:14,279
You better not fucking come in.

4663
05:37:14,279 --> 05:37:28,500
This goes down around here.

4664
05:37:28,500 --> 05:37:36,180
Cool.

4665
05:37:36,180 --> 05:37:36,900
Now you lost me.

4666
05:37:39,619 --> 05:37:44,419
Stretch the rubber band on the right-hand lever up and over the tabs and it sits in the notch.

4667
05:37:45,139 --> 05:37:47,349
Fucking shut up.

4668
05:37:50,389 --> 05:37:52,630
What the fuck are you talking about?

4669
05:37:52,630 --> 05:37:52,950
Okay.

4670
05:37:52,950 --> 05:37:57,290
So like this over here.

4671
05:37:58,819 --> 05:38:01,060
I'm so good at everything.

4672
05:38:01,060 --> 05:38:02,819
I'm so good at everything.

4673
05:38:02,819 --> 05:38:08,459
Same thing on the other side.

4674
05:38:08,459 --> 05:38:12,220
Can I get it?

4675
05:38:15,500 --> 05:38:19,259
Fucking everything he does is perfect.

4676
05:38:19,259 --> 05:38:21,209
There it is.

4677
05:38:21,209 --> 05:38:49,349
Just look in there and tell me I fucking couldn't do this shit on my own.

4678
05:38:49,349 --> 05:38:55,459
Now we're good.

4679
05:38:56,180 --> 05:38:56,979
All right.

4680
05:38:56,979 --> 05:39:11,909
Check the right rubber band.

4681
05:39:12,470 --> 05:39:19,240
That's why you guys are the number one community on Twitch.

4682
05:39:20,360 --> 05:39:21,560
Somebody caught that.

4683
05:39:22,200 --> 05:39:23,319
I don't know how you did.

4684
05:39:32,700 --> 05:39:32,939
All right.

4685
05:39:32,939 --> 05:39:33,580
We're almost done.

4686
05:39:44,599 --> 05:39:45,720
Only three more steps.

4687
05:39:52,889 --> 05:39:53,450
G and H.

4688
05:39:54,090 --> 05:40:01,590
That's it.

4689
05:40:03,849 --> 05:40:04,090
H.

4690
05:40:06,860 --> 05:40:08,139
Uh, left side here.

4691
05:40:08,860 --> 05:40:17,240
Got it.

4692
05:40:17,799 --> 05:40:22,169
He's not coming in here.

4693
05:40:22,169 --> 05:40:26,169
Let me get all the nubs out.

4694
05:40:31,380 --> 05:40:46,580
Let me get the nubs out there.

4695
05:40:46,580 --> 05:40:46,819
Okay.

4696
05:40:47,700 --> 05:40:49,060
Looks good.

4697
05:40:49,779 --> 05:40:50,419
Okay.

4698
05:40:55,130 --> 05:40:55,369
Okay.

4699
05:41:01,380 --> 05:41:02,099
Now let me go.

4700
05:41:13,529 --> 05:41:14,250
I'm gonna go over here.

4701
05:41:19,380 --> 05:41:22,020
Uh, three nubs, four nubs, five nubs are out.

4702
05:41:22,900 --> 05:41:29,020
Okay.

4703
05:41:29,020 --> 05:41:29,500
Looks good.

4704
05:41:33,020 --> 05:41:34,619
Uh, have you dropped frames?

4705
05:41:34,700 --> 05:41:37,819
Uh, like a couple thousand right now, I guess.

4706
05:41:37,819 --> 05:41:38,779
So I'm sorry about that.

4707
05:41:48,919 --> 05:41:50,680
Why did that increase your viewers?

4708
05:41:51,720 --> 05:41:52,599
I don't know.

4709
05:41:52,599 --> 05:41:54,200
I don't, I don't have an answer for you.

4710
05:41:54,200 --> 05:41:55,159
I'm sorry.

4711
05:41:55,159 --> 05:42:05,990
Okay.

4712
05:42:05,990 --> 05:42:06,790
We're good.

4713
05:42:06,790 --> 05:42:09,500
Oh, okay.

4714
05:42:09,500 --> 05:42:09,979
We're fine.

4715
05:42:11,689 --> 05:42:13,130
Just check, just checking the vitals, you know.

4716
05:42:13,130 --> 05:42:14,490
I gotta check my vitals sometimes.

4717
05:42:15,770 --> 05:42:20,409
The vitals need to be checked.

4718
05:42:20,409 --> 05:42:37,220
All right.

4719
05:42:37,220 --> 05:42:47,689
What are we doing?

4720
05:42:47,689 --> 05:42:49,610
Don't let him re-watch this when he's sober.

4721
05:42:50,889 --> 05:42:54,090
Do you think it's any different than when I'm fucking not drinking?

4722
05:42:56,630 --> 05:42:57,509
I have nothing to hide.

4723
05:42:58,150 --> 05:43:01,130
Do you think I got something to hide?

4724
05:43:01,930 --> 05:43:08,810
Oh, wow.

4725
05:43:08,810 --> 05:43:11,450
I really was weird on Twitch last night.

4726
05:43:11,450 --> 05:43:11,849
Whatever.

4727
05:43:12,490 --> 05:43:26,380
Maybe I shouldn't have done that weird stuff on Twitch.

4728
05:43:30,470 --> 05:43:34,680
All right.

4729
05:43:34,680 --> 05:43:36,200
So that's good there.

4730
05:43:36,919 --> 05:43:42,569
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4731
05:43:42,569 --> 05:43:42,889
Okay.

4732
05:43:42,889 --> 05:43:49,029
So Twitch fails.

4733
05:43:49,990 --> 05:43:51,270
What have I done that was a fail?

4734
05:43:51,270 --> 05:43:51,990
I didn't do anything.

4735
05:43:52,869 --> 05:43:54,889
I did a fake clown horn.

4736
05:43:55,689 --> 05:44:03,349
Perfect.

4737
05:44:03,349 --> 05:44:10,549
Bring this over here and fold it up.

4738
05:44:11,189 --> 05:44:13,430
Where does that go?

4739
05:44:14,470 --> 05:44:15,110
Right in the middle.

4740
05:44:22,009 --> 05:44:23,610
Top live stream fail.

4741
05:44:24,490 --> 05:44:27,020
I didn't do anything.

4742
05:44:27,740 --> 05:44:31,560
Looks good.

4743
05:44:31,560 --> 05:44:33,849
All right.

4744
05:44:33,849 --> 05:44:34,650
Next up is this piece.

4745
05:44:34,650 --> 05:44:35,049
Let's see it.

4746
05:44:35,770 --> 05:44:44,200
I did fail.

4747
05:44:45,799 --> 05:44:47,189
How?

4748
05:44:47,189 --> 05:44:49,610
How did I fail?

4749
05:44:52,889 --> 05:44:53,610
What are you talking about?

4750
05:44:54,490 --> 05:45:01,270
No, I get it now.

4751
05:45:01,990 --> 05:45:09,060
I get it.

4752
05:45:09,060 --> 05:45:09,380
Sorry.

4753
05:45:17,419 --> 05:45:17,979
Sorry.

4754
05:45:17,979 --> 05:45:26,580
I feel grilled.

4755
05:45:28,470 --> 05:45:29,909
I'm sorry you feel that way.

4756
05:45:30,549 --> 05:45:41,180
Is this correct?

4757
05:45:41,819 --> 05:45:45,659
Yeah, it is.

4758
05:45:46,299 --> 05:45:47,430
What the fuck?

4759
05:45:47,430 --> 05:45:48,069
What are these for?

4760
05:45:48,709 --> 05:47:05,750
That looks good.

4761
05:47:05,750 --> 05:47:06,310
Part H.

4762
05:47:08,790 --> 05:47:10,889
The last little bits here.

4763
05:47:10,889 --> 05:47:15,110
And then two.

4764
05:47:15,110 --> 05:47:17,400
What'd you miss?

4765
05:47:17,959 --> 05:47:20,340
You're gonna fight with Charlie.

4766
05:47:20,340 --> 05:47:25,290
That's pretty much it.

4767
05:47:25,290 --> 05:47:32,020
Looks good.

4768
05:47:36,169 --> 05:47:36,810
And lost.

4769
05:47:40,409 --> 05:47:41,529
It's funny that you think that.

4770
05:47:42,330 --> 05:47:42,650
Whoa.

4771
05:47:43,770 --> 05:47:44,090
Wee.

4772
05:47:44,889 --> 05:47:45,930
Wee, I'm on a swing.

4773
05:47:45,930 --> 05:47:46,970
Mom, push me more.

4774
05:47:46,970 --> 05:47:48,330
Push me a little bit higher.

4775
05:47:48,330 --> 05:47:48,810
That's you.

4776
05:48:16,659 --> 05:48:18,740
No, that was me doing that to Charlie.

4777
05:48:18,740 --> 05:48:19,459
Not to you.

4778
05:48:19,459 --> 05:48:21,349
What are you talking about?

4779
05:48:21,349 --> 05:48:22,869
Don't put words in my hands.

4780
05:48:23,750 --> 05:48:31,909
That's not right.

4781
05:48:31,909 --> 05:48:43,669
How many figures am I holding up?

4782
05:48:43,669 --> 05:48:44,630
Um, whatever.

4783
05:48:44,630 --> 05:48:45,990
Best of live stream fail.

4784
05:48:45,990 --> 05:48:46,869
What the fuck is this?

4785
05:48:47,590 --> 05:48:49,049
Better not fuck with me here.

4786
05:48:49,049 --> 05:48:49,930
Don't fuck with me.

4787
05:48:52,180 --> 05:48:53,459
Your friend is dying on camera?

4788
05:48:54,180 --> 05:48:56,819
I guess I'll have to watch that later on live stream fail.

4789
05:48:57,619 --> 05:49:00,740
It'll probably be the top like best of live stream fail.

4790
05:49:01,700 --> 05:49:02,580
Don't do that.

4791
05:49:02,580 --> 05:49:07,080
Hey, Shadowlight, what's up?

4792
05:49:07,080 --> 05:49:14,409
But yeah, I'll look at that later.

4793
05:49:14,409 --> 05:49:15,369
I don't care about that.

4794
05:49:15,369 --> 05:49:17,209
All I care about is this colony.

4795
05:49:17,209 --> 05:49:18,169
I have an undying.

4796
05:49:20,340 --> 05:49:20,979
Don't fucking.

4797
05:49:20,979 --> 05:49:22,099
I don't belong on there.

4798
05:49:22,099 --> 05:49:23,299
I didn't do anything weird today.

4799
05:49:27,430 --> 05:49:31,659
I didn't do anything to belong on there.

4800
05:49:31,659 --> 05:49:33,580
Nice people on there sometimes, you know?

4801
05:49:33,580 --> 05:49:37,270
But whatever.

4802
05:49:37,270 --> 05:49:39,159
I didn't do anything.

4803
05:49:39,159 --> 05:49:40,200
I didn't do anything.

4804
05:49:40,200 --> 05:49:43,900
So I didn't do anything weird today.

4805
05:49:44,540 --> 05:49:47,299
How much is the rent in Las Vegas?

4806
05:49:47,299 --> 05:49:49,299
$20,000 a month.

4807
05:49:49,299 --> 05:49:51,939
That was weird, but that's not like live stream fails weird.

4808
05:49:51,939 --> 05:50:21,610
I'm not weird.

4809
05:50:21,610 --> 05:50:22,939
I'm not.

4810
05:50:22,939 --> 05:50:24,220
I'm just fucking around.

4811
05:50:24,220 --> 05:50:25,020
I'm not weird.

4812
05:50:25,020 --> 05:50:30,389
What is this clip?

4813
05:50:30,389 --> 05:50:32,229
Nice people on there sometimes, you know?

4814
05:50:32,229 --> 05:50:36,619
But I didn't do anything.

4815
05:50:37,180 --> 05:50:38,840
I didn't do anything.

4816
05:50:38,840 --> 05:50:42,500
So I didn't do anything weird today.

4817
05:50:43,139 --> 05:50:45,979
How much is the rent in Las Vegas?

4818
05:50:45,979 --> 05:50:47,580
$20,000 a month.

4819
05:50:48,220 --> 05:50:49,180
That's not weird.

4820
05:50:49,180 --> 05:50:50,220
That's not weird.

4821
05:50:50,220 --> 05:50:51,459
That's me stating.

4822
05:51:01,450 --> 05:51:04,180
Hey, let me tell you guys something.

4823
05:51:04,180 --> 05:51:05,459
Fast forward right now.

4824
05:51:06,389 --> 05:51:08,069
Three or four hours from now,

4825
05:51:08,069 --> 05:51:10,549
I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.

4826
05:51:10,549 --> 05:51:11,990
My face is going to be greasy.

4827
05:51:11,990 --> 05:51:13,669
I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.

4828
05:51:13,669 --> 05:51:15,430
I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.

4829
05:51:15,430 --> 05:51:17,430
Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.

4830
05:51:17,430 --> 05:51:18,630
It's going to look really bad.

4831
05:51:19,509 --> 05:51:27,479
Oh yeah?

4832
05:51:27,479 --> 05:51:30,169
You think so, Jeremy?

4833
05:51:30,169 --> 05:51:31,419
Has it been two hours?

4834
05:51:31,979 --> 05:51:33,500
Hour and a half?

4835
05:51:33,500 --> 05:51:35,450
Let's take a look.

4836
05:51:41,319 --> 05:51:44,060
Hey, let me tell you guys something.

4837
05:51:44,060 --> 05:51:45,340
Fast forward right now.

4838
05:51:46,220 --> 05:51:47,979
Three or four hours from now,

4839
05:51:47,979 --> 05:51:50,299
I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.

4840
05:51:50,299 --> 05:51:50,779
Do I though?

4841
05:51:50,779 --> 05:51:51,900
My face is going to be greasy.

4842
05:51:51,900 --> 05:51:53,580
I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.

4843
05:51:53,580 --> 05:51:55,340
I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.

4844
05:51:55,340 --> 05:51:57,340
Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.

4845
05:51:57,340 --> 05:51:58,540
It's going to look really bad.

4846
05:51:58,540 --> 05:51:59,580
Just remember this.

4847
05:51:59,580 --> 05:52:01,099
Like three or four hours from now, okay?

4848
05:52:02,790 --> 05:52:03,430
Remember this.

4849
05:52:07,419 --> 05:52:08,540
Hey, say it again.

4850
05:52:08,540 --> 05:52:10,139
Let me tell you guys something.

4851
05:52:10,139 --> 05:52:11,419
Fast forward right now.

4852
05:52:12,299 --> 05:52:14,060
Three or four hours from now,

4853
05:52:14,060 --> 05:52:16,540
I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.

4854
05:52:16,540 --> 05:52:17,979
My face is going to be greasy.

4855
05:52:17,979 --> 05:52:19,659
I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.

4856
05:52:19,659 --> 05:52:21,419
I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.

4857
05:52:21,419 --> 05:52:23,419
Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.

4858
05:52:23,419 --> 05:52:24,619
It's going to look really bad.

4859
05:52:24,619 --> 05:52:25,659
Just remember this.

4860
05:52:25,659 --> 05:52:27,340
Like three or four hours from now, okay?

4861
05:52:27,340 --> 05:52:27,900
Get out of here.

4862
05:52:28,860 --> 05:52:39,849
He's wrong.

4863
05:52:39,849 --> 05:52:40,490
I look the same.

4864
05:52:42,459 --> 05:52:44,299
All right, grub comes up.

4865
05:52:44,299 --> 05:52:45,259
Snap comes down.

4866
05:52:45,659 --> 05:52:46,139
Looks good.

4867
05:52:51,380 --> 05:52:51,939
All right.

4868
05:52:51,939 --> 05:52:52,740
Looks all right.

4869
05:52:53,380 --> 05:53:06,779
Has your box magically formed a nice little roof like this?

4870
05:53:06,779 --> 05:53:09,130
If it hasn't, go back and check.

4871
05:53:10,169 --> 05:53:12,650
I got a nice little roof like that.

4872
05:53:12,650 --> 05:53:22,250
Why am I wearing?

4873
05:53:23,049 --> 05:53:24,250
I'm not wearing any headphones.

4874
05:53:27,959 --> 05:53:31,180
Looks like Mr. Rootbox has got a hole in his forehead.

4875
05:53:31,180 --> 05:53:32,380
We're going to cover that up for him.

4876
05:53:32,939 --> 05:53:33,900
Where are those?

4877
05:53:33,900 --> 05:53:43,529
It's right over the lid there.

4878
05:53:43,529 --> 05:53:58,659
Nothing goes in there.

4879
05:53:59,939 --> 05:54:01,299
So it just goes up like that.

4880
05:54:01,299 --> 05:54:01,860
Nothing goes in there.

4881
05:54:06,619 --> 05:54:08,139
So it just goes over the whole thing.

4882
05:54:08,139 --> 05:54:08,459
Okay.

4883
05:54:10,090 --> 05:54:11,290
Don't fuck with me, dude.

4884
05:54:11,290 --> 05:54:12,409
Don't fuck with me here, man.

4885
05:54:18,060 --> 05:54:19,659
Oh, Jeremy's too drunk to do it.

4886
05:54:20,220 --> 05:54:23,319
All right.

4887
05:54:23,319 --> 05:54:25,319
Natalix is fucking shit faced.

4888
05:54:25,319 --> 05:54:31,669
Rubber band.

4889
05:54:31,669 --> 05:54:32,470
One of the little ones.

4890
05:54:35,619 --> 05:54:36,740
Small rubber band.

4891
05:54:39,060 --> 05:54:39,619
Two holes.

4892
05:55:01,959 --> 05:55:02,680
Well, it's been fun.

4893
05:55:03,400 --> 05:55:04,200
See you guys never.

4894
05:55:04,200 --> 05:55:06,119
I'm deleting my Twitch channel, my YouTube.

4895
05:55:07,799 --> 05:55:11,750
I'm deleting my Instagram, my Twitter.

4896
05:55:11,750 --> 05:55:12,630
It's all getting deleted.

4897
05:55:13,880 --> 05:55:19,450
Sorry.

4898
05:55:19,450 --> 05:55:20,490
Somebody said good.

4899
05:55:21,590 --> 05:55:22,310
Fuck, dude.

4900
05:55:25,110 --> 05:55:25,349
Good.

4901
05:55:29,930 --> 05:55:31,610
Damn, that makes me like sad.

4902
05:55:32,409 --> 05:55:34,119
Fuck.

4903
05:55:34,119 --> 05:55:40,970
So that's in there.

4904
05:55:47,209 --> 05:55:47,689
That's it.

4905
05:55:50,099 --> 05:55:50,900
Wait, why is it?

4906
05:55:53,770 --> 05:55:55,849
So that's the way it looks.

4907
05:55:55,849 --> 05:55:56,169
Okay.

4908
05:55:59,049 --> 05:55:59,610
String.

4909
05:56:02,380 --> 05:56:03,340
Oh, worms.

4910
05:56:04,630 --> 05:56:05,590
What the fuck?

4911
05:56:05,590 --> 05:56:06,310
It's a worm?

4912
05:56:06,950 --> 05:56:28,819
It's gone.

4913
05:56:28,819 --> 05:56:29,779
Oh, I needed that.

4914
05:56:29,779 --> 05:56:30,580
I need that.

4915
05:56:30,580 --> 05:56:31,540
I need that thing.

4916
05:56:40,069 --> 05:56:40,549
Okay.

4917
05:56:40,549 --> 05:56:49,380
I got it back like this.

4918
05:56:49,380 --> 05:56:51,540
Like that.

4919
05:56:51,540 --> 05:56:58,139
Like this.

4920
05:56:59,430 --> 05:57:02,389
Who just gave a hundred fucking dollars to this terrible stream?

4921
05:57:11,740 --> 05:57:16,939
Thank you, Deuce the Gamer for the $100.

4922
05:57:20,580 --> 05:57:23,700
I demand you do the submarine next.

4923
05:57:23,700 --> 05:57:24,950
Germa expensive.

4924
05:57:25,590 --> 05:57:33,270
Let's see.

4925
05:57:37,540 --> 05:57:38,979
Thank you for the hundred bucks though, man.

4926
05:57:38,979 --> 05:57:39,540
Holy shit.

4927
05:57:40,099 --> 05:57:47,509
That's a lot of fucking money.

4928
05:57:48,069 --> 05:57:48,470
We'll see.

4929
05:57:50,409 --> 05:57:51,049
Submarine.

4930
05:57:51,049 --> 05:57:51,610
You got it.

4931
05:57:52,330 --> 05:57:56,229
What do I do with this?

4932
05:58:00,819 --> 05:58:02,740
Not the end of the spring just as shown.

4933
05:58:06,650 --> 05:58:11,720
Oh, pretzel.

4934
05:58:11,720 --> 05:58:12,520
Pretzel.

4935
05:58:12,520 --> 05:58:15,319
That didn't work.

4936
05:58:15,319 --> 05:58:38,139
A hundred bucks from Kyra Toby.

4937
05:58:38,139 --> 05:58:40,310
Hey, Germa, I like your hair.

4938
05:58:40,310 --> 05:58:47,529
So much money.

4939
05:58:48,409 --> 05:58:49,369
So much money.

4940
05:58:49,369 --> 05:58:50,729
Do you like my magic trick?

4941
05:58:56,740 --> 05:58:57,220
Jesus.

4942
05:58:59,770 --> 05:59:03,500
Thank you.

4943
05:59:03,500 --> 05:59:06,779
Two hundred dollars for eating and regurgitating string.

4944
05:59:09,590 --> 05:59:10,389
Thank you, Kyra.

4945
05:59:10,389 --> 05:59:11,430
Thank you, Kyra Toby.

4946
05:59:11,430 --> 05:59:14,069
And to Deuce the Gamer, both of you guys, for real.

4947
05:59:14,709 --> 05:59:16,259
They liked your hair.

4948
05:59:16,819 --> 05:59:18,069
Thanks, man.

4949
05:59:21,380 --> 05:59:22,659
I still got a hairline.

4950
05:59:22,659 --> 05:59:23,220
Still there.

4951
05:59:23,860 --> 05:59:25,340
I'm thirty-three.

4952
05:59:25,340 --> 05:59:26,220
Thirty-three.

4953
05:59:29,450 --> 05:59:31,369
I'm fucking good for thirty-three.

4954
05:59:31,369 --> 05:59:32,090
You know what I mean?

4955
05:59:32,090 --> 05:59:43,720
Look, let me tie a fucking knot.

4956
05:59:43,720 --> 05:59:44,119
Please.

4957
05:59:57,540 --> 05:59:58,259
How do I do this?

4958
06:00:05,419 --> 06:00:07,340
I did it.

4959
06:00:07,340 --> 06:00:15,000
In case you're having trouble, here are some step-by-step images.

4960
06:00:15,560 --> 06:00:16,840
Have you made a proper knot?

4961
06:00:16,840 --> 06:00:17,080
I have.

4962
06:00:35,209 --> 06:00:35,770
What happened?

4963
06:00:47,369 --> 06:00:49,849
Deuce the Gamer gave a hundred dollars.

4964
06:00:51,060 --> 06:00:52,740
Also, the helicopter, too.

4965
06:00:57,450 --> 06:01:05,419
Thank you, Deuce the Gamer, for the hundred fucking bucks.

4966
06:01:08,700 --> 06:01:10,700
And the helicopter.

4967
06:01:10,700 --> 06:01:12,139
Yeah, fuck yeah, dude.

4968
06:01:12,139 --> 06:01:13,900
I'm not turning the stream off till it's done.

4969
06:01:18,860 --> 06:01:23,479
Bebraham gave twenty community subs.

4970
06:01:25,959 --> 06:01:26,840
Twenty of them.

4971
06:01:26,840 --> 06:01:27,240
Twenty.

4972
06:01:31,130 --> 06:01:32,009
Holy fuck.

4973
06:01:32,009 --> 06:01:32,509
Okay.

4974
06:01:37,099 --> 06:01:38,139
Thank you, Bebraham.

4975
06:01:38,139 --> 06:01:39,659
That's a fucking lot of subs.

4976
06:01:39,659 --> 06:01:40,540
And thank you for the hundred.

4977
06:01:42,860 --> 06:01:43,259
Two.

4978
06:01:43,259 --> 06:01:44,700
Three hundred dollars.

4979
06:01:49,500 --> 06:01:50,779
Deuce the Gamer, Karatobi.

4980
06:01:50,779 --> 06:01:51,500
Deuce the Gamer again.

4981
06:02:03,430 --> 06:02:12,970
That's a lot of fucking money.

4982
06:02:21,020 --> 06:02:21,520
Thank you.

4983
06:02:32,150 --> 06:02:34,310
No messages, really, or anything, but...

4984
06:02:36,630 --> 06:02:39,830
Besides, to make the helicopter and make the submachine.

4985
06:02:41,029 --> 06:02:41,529
Gun.

4986
06:02:47,590 --> 06:02:51,540
He's gonna wake up tomorrow and not know what those stacks of money are from.

4987
06:03:01,400 --> 06:03:02,119
Thanks.

4988
06:03:02,119 --> 06:03:05,029
Cry.

4989
06:03:05,029 --> 06:03:05,830
Cry.

4990
06:03:05,830 --> 06:03:06,709
Cry.

4991
06:03:06,709 --> 06:03:07,209
Cry.

4992
06:03:09,509 --> 06:03:19,060
I'm not gonna cry.

4993
06:03:20,500 --> 06:03:24,729
But cry, you baby.

4994
06:03:24,729 --> 06:03:25,049
What?

4995
06:03:25,049 --> 06:03:26,250
I didn't do anything.

4996
06:03:26,250 --> 06:03:27,930
I just didn't cry.

4997
06:03:37,049 --> 06:03:37,610
For real, though.

4998
06:03:42,819 --> 06:03:53,130
Where's the puke string?

4999
06:03:59,590 --> 06:04:00,389
Where's the string?

5000
06:04:07,000 --> 06:04:07,500
There it is.

5001
06:04:10,250 --> 06:04:11,130
Kidding, I'm not gonna do it again.

5002
06:04:14,169 --> 06:04:15,610
You guys are too fucking kind.

5003
06:04:15,610 --> 06:04:16,110
Seriously.

5004
06:04:17,830 --> 06:04:21,189
Thank you for the massive, obscene amounts of money.

5005
06:04:22,250 --> 06:04:23,209
Obscene.

5006
06:04:23,209 --> 06:04:25,209
Obscene amounts of fucking money.

5007
06:04:31,740 --> 06:04:32,240
Thank you.

5008
06:04:41,540 --> 06:04:42,419
How does this go through?

5009
06:04:51,529 --> 06:04:53,049
If you were rich, you'd buy me a car.

5010
06:04:53,689 --> 06:04:54,970
You don't have to buy me a car, man.

5011
06:04:58,069 --> 06:05:02,229
So many people gave so much money to this fucking stream that, you know, don't worry about it.

5012
06:05:05,459 --> 06:05:06,979
It's fucking hard to believe sometimes.

5013
06:05:06,979 --> 06:05:07,479
For real.

5014
06:05:09,209 --> 06:05:09,709
No jokes.

5015
06:05:10,650 --> 06:05:16,740
Where does this go?

5016
06:05:23,700 --> 06:05:25,700
This smells like the inside of my mouth.

5017
06:05:41,189 --> 06:05:41,590
Right.

5018
06:05:41,590 --> 06:05:42,389
I got it right.

5019
06:05:44,860 --> 06:05:45,500
Done.

5020
06:05:45,500 --> 06:05:59,990
Got it.

5021
06:05:59,990 --> 06:06:00,709
Rubber band.

5022
06:06:01,590 --> 06:06:08,549
Oh yeah.

5023
06:06:20,229 --> 06:06:22,619
$15 from Butterderp.

5024
06:06:22,619 --> 06:06:24,540
$10 from Rionic.

5025
06:06:24,540 --> 06:06:25,040
Thank you.

5026
06:06:27,479 --> 06:06:29,400
Jeremy, I've been watching your streams on your YouTube for a while.

5027
06:06:29,400 --> 06:06:31,080
I figured I might as well join in on the meme.

5028
06:06:31,639 --> 06:06:35,639
Wish you the very best, as you always stay true to being a down-to-earth dude.

5029
06:06:37,000 --> 06:06:39,880
I can't pretend to be anybody else, so thank you.

5030
06:06:39,880 --> 06:06:41,270
I'm glad you think that way.

5031
06:06:41,270 --> 06:06:41,990
Thanks so much, man.

5032
06:06:43,990 --> 06:06:48,389
Enraged Grandpa with five community subs.

5033
06:06:49,909 --> 06:06:51,659
Thank you, Grandpa.

5034
06:07:11,020 --> 06:07:12,700
I'll just fucking shit-faced over there.

5035
06:07:12,700 --> 06:07:13,259
I can hear him.

5036
06:07:14,380 --> 06:07:15,819
All right, that looks good, right?

5037
06:07:16,860 --> 06:07:17,580
That looks correct.

5038
06:07:32,900 --> 06:07:41,849
What are you doing?

5039
06:07:45,240 --> 06:07:45,959
Fifty.

5040
06:07:45,959 --> 06:07:46,759
Five zero.

5041
06:07:52,310 --> 06:07:54,229
Fifty.

5042
06:07:54,229 --> 06:07:54,709
Fifty.

5043
06:07:58,310 --> 06:07:59,430
Fifty.

5044
06:07:59,430 --> 06:08:02,340
Community subs from Tora T.

5045
06:08:12,060 --> 06:08:12,939
Holy shit.

5046
06:08:18,139 --> 06:08:22,709
I can't even fucking comprehend this right now.

5047
06:08:40,200 --> 06:08:43,930
Show us your dick.

5048
06:08:44,810 --> 06:08:45,849
I read that.

5049
06:08:45,849 --> 06:08:46,810
I read that out loud.

5050
06:08:47,450 --> 06:08:48,009
Uh, no.

5051
06:08:50,099 --> 06:08:56,819
Uh, Tora, Tora, that's an insane amount of fucking gifted subs.

5052
06:08:59,830 --> 06:09:03,110
That's an in-fucking-sane amount of people to give subs to.

5053
06:09:05,939 --> 06:09:13,669
Uh, don't make it a competition.

5054
06:09:13,669 --> 06:09:14,869
I hope it's not.

5055
06:09:14,869 --> 06:09:16,709
Don't treat this like a competition, guys.

5056
06:09:20,380 --> 06:09:21,819
Uh, it's not.

5057
06:09:21,819 --> 06:09:28,779
So, uh, that's like, that's $250 somebody just spent right now.

5058
06:09:28,779 --> 06:09:29,259
Tora T.

5059
06:09:30,060 --> 06:09:37,400
So don't, don't let me get away with this.

5060
06:09:37,400 --> 06:09:37,959
You know what I mean?

5061
06:09:38,919 --> 06:09:41,509
And here's what I mean by that.

5062
06:09:43,369 --> 06:09:48,889
Uh, there's like 10 different, like, huge streams I want to do.

5063
06:09:50,459 --> 06:09:55,180
Uh, don't let me just like, oh, whatever, whatever, whatever.

5064
06:09:55,180 --> 06:09:56,299
Oh, I just didn't do it.

5065
06:09:57,180 --> 06:10:02,939
It's a lot of fucking money for someone to have.

5066
06:10:04,069 --> 06:10:05,110
And I want to use it.

5067
06:10:13,340 --> 06:10:15,580
Don't, don't let me just fucking take your money and like rung.

5068
06:10:16,540 --> 06:10:24,650
Because you deserve, uh, you deserve to have something to show for it.

5069
06:10:24,650 --> 06:10:28,650
I can't fucking imagine spending two, three, four hundred fucking dollars on somebody.

5070
06:10:37,560 --> 06:10:39,080
I hope it's worth your while.

5071
06:10:39,080 --> 06:10:39,560
I'll try.

5072
06:10:40,520 --> 06:10:40,919
Thank you.

5073
06:10:42,680 --> 06:10:45,799
Uh, Tora T for the fucking insane amount of subscriptions.

5074
06:10:45,799 --> 06:10:50,279
And then Tiny Cactus comes in with five, five or fifty, doesn't fucking matter.

5075
06:10:52,119 --> 06:10:53,400
You guys are all fucking insane.

5076
06:10:53,400 --> 06:10:54,360
You guys are all incredible.

5077
06:10:55,080 --> 06:10:56,439
Do we have a date for the green screen?

5078
06:10:56,439 --> 06:10:57,159
Yes, Thursday.

5079
06:10:57,159 --> 06:10:58,520
Thursday is the green screen.

5080
06:11:03,220 --> 06:11:05,020
There is a date.

5081
06:11:05,659 --> 06:11:10,939
All right.

5082
06:11:10,939 --> 06:11:11,580
We need the engine.

5083
06:11:16,779 --> 06:11:18,139
I don't take this shit for granted.

5084
06:11:18,139 --> 06:11:19,259
I try not to.

5085
06:11:19,259 --> 06:11:20,220
I really don't want to.

5086
06:11:21,020 --> 06:11:24,020
It's a lot of fucking money.

5087
06:11:25,979 --> 06:11:27,259
Somebody has to fucking make that money.

5088
06:11:27,259 --> 06:11:28,299
Somebody has to work for that money.

5089
06:11:28,299 --> 06:11:29,659
Somebody has to make that fucking money.

5090
06:11:29,659 --> 06:11:30,139
You know what I mean?

5091
06:11:31,180 --> 06:11:36,250
That money comes from somewhere, you know, for free.

5092
06:11:37,290 --> 06:11:40,409
I hope you realize I don't fucking take that for granted at all.

5093
06:11:46,970 --> 06:11:52,549
Drugs, drugs.

5094
06:11:53,590 --> 06:11:58,630
This is, this is me working for that money.

5095
06:11:59,430 --> 06:12:02,759
If you say so.

5096
06:12:02,759 --> 06:12:06,180
I just, we've talked about a thousand times.

5097
06:12:09,189 --> 06:12:16,259
Let me at least try to make it fucking worth you being here.

5098
06:12:18,790 --> 06:12:19,509
I'll break it.

5099
06:12:25,380 --> 06:12:26,180
That's correct, right?

5100
06:12:30,409 --> 06:12:32,090
Oh, even more subscription.

5101
06:12:32,090 --> 06:12:34,330
Nat Kitty gives five community subs.

5102
06:12:35,909 --> 06:12:36,310
Thank you.

5103
06:12:37,029 --> 06:12:39,830
It's never ending, Tim Allen.

5104
06:12:39,830 --> 06:12:41,270
It's not going to stop for a long time.

5105
06:12:45,799 --> 06:12:48,360
Don't underestimate the power of entertaining someone.

5106
06:12:49,909 --> 06:12:53,029
Yeah, but money, it's a lot of fucking money, man.

5107
06:12:55,340 --> 06:12:57,500
Some of you guys pay 10 bucks a month for Netflix.

5108
06:13:00,259 --> 06:13:01,700
I got to at least try.

5109
06:13:01,700 --> 06:13:02,659
You know what I'm saying?

5110
06:13:02,659 --> 06:13:04,819
Like, I got to fucking at least try.

5111
06:13:19,130 --> 06:13:21,209
You're more entertaining than Netflix, to be honest.

5112
06:13:22,090 --> 06:13:23,939
If you say so, I hope so.

5113
06:13:26,099 --> 06:13:26,419
Thank you.

5114
06:13:31,590 --> 06:13:34,389
Well, you do what you do without a salary.

5115
06:13:36,500 --> 06:13:38,500
You guys pay my fucking salary.

5116
06:13:38,500 --> 06:13:39,939
So that's what this shit is all about.

5117
06:13:41,689 --> 06:13:43,049
Just look at the last 20 minutes.

5118
06:13:48,220 --> 06:13:51,259
You guys pay my fucking salary.

5119
06:13:53,400 --> 06:13:55,400
It had better be worth it.

5120
06:14:09,319 --> 06:14:10,439
So where are you, boss?

5121
06:14:11,400 --> 06:14:13,479
In a sense, kind of, yeah.

5122
06:14:17,990 --> 06:14:19,830
Novi came in with five community subs.

5123
06:14:20,470 --> 06:14:21,750
Five community subs of Novi.

5124
06:14:23,880 --> 06:14:25,240
This year, cry.

5125
06:14:25,240 --> 06:14:26,360
I'm not going to cry.

5126
06:14:29,560 --> 06:14:31,639
I'm not going to cry, okay?

5127
06:14:35,700 --> 06:14:38,819
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.

5128
06:14:53,029 --> 06:15:04,419
Bebraham gave 20 more, so thank you, Bebraham.

5129
06:15:11,259 --> 06:15:16,020
I just want you guys to leave each stream and say that was fun.

5130
06:15:16,020 --> 06:15:18,560
That's it.

5131
06:15:18,560 --> 06:15:28,779
I'm going to cry.

5132
06:15:29,659 --> 06:15:31,290
I'm not going to fucking cry.

5133
06:15:32,409 --> 06:15:39,680
Whoa, am I still on this?

5134
06:15:39,680 --> 06:15:41,040
People are giving a lot of money.

5135
06:15:44,220 --> 06:15:45,419
Somebody said wimp.

5136
06:15:46,700 --> 06:15:48,540
I didn't, that was a pretend.

5137
06:15:48,540 --> 06:15:49,740
All right, what do I do with this thing?

5138
06:15:50,970 --> 06:15:53,369
Thank you for the 20 fucking community subs, dude.

5139
06:15:54,720 --> 06:15:55,220
Jesus.

5140
06:15:58,279 --> 06:16:00,360
Just wait till the green screen stream.

5141
06:16:01,000 --> 06:16:02,119
That's going to be a ton of fun.

5142
06:16:04,380 --> 06:16:07,020
Week or two later, we're going to have a fucking movie night.

5143
06:16:08,139 --> 06:16:10,220
Then like two weeks later, there's going to be something else.

5144
06:16:11,099 --> 06:16:18,299
Christ.

5145
06:16:32,680 --> 06:16:34,919
Thank you, Kairatobi for the 20 subs.

5146
06:16:36,509 --> 06:16:38,430
20 community subs from Kairatobi.

5147
06:16:44,880 --> 06:16:46,720
A lot of fucking people and a lot of subs.

5148
06:16:46,720 --> 06:16:48,799
20 people even is a lot of people.

5149
06:16:53,840 --> 06:16:56,000
Proud pleb forever.

5150
06:16:57,439 --> 06:17:00,080
And I'm, I, that's fine.

5151
06:17:01,439 --> 06:17:02,479
That's fine, man.

5152
06:17:02,479 --> 06:17:05,529
Like it's, it's fine.

5153
06:17:05,529 --> 06:17:07,209
Like I don't, you don't have to subscribe.

5154
06:17:08,889 --> 06:17:12,200
Did you have any fun?

5155
06:17:12,200 --> 06:17:14,040
If the answer was yes, then that's fucking fine.

5156
06:17:18,729 --> 06:17:21,130
You've made $250 an hour this stream.

5157
06:17:21,849 --> 06:17:24,060
That's more money than a fucking doctor.

5158
06:17:26,779 --> 06:17:27,500
Do you understand?

5159
06:17:29,500 --> 06:17:31,099
Sometimes people, why, why do you feel this way?

5160
06:17:31,099 --> 06:17:32,060
Why do you act like that?

5161
06:17:32,060 --> 06:17:33,099
And people are just giving you money.

5162
06:17:33,099 --> 06:17:34,779
That's like more money than a fucking surgeon.

5163
06:17:35,979 --> 06:17:42,270
So sorry that sometimes I can be like, I hope it's fucking worth it.

5164
06:17:42,909 --> 06:17:45,069
Cause I really believe that.

5165
06:17:48,490 --> 06:17:52,779
All right.

5166
06:17:52,779 --> 06:17:54,220
Thread the ring.

5167
06:17:56,319 --> 06:17:58,159
It's way more than $250 an hour.

5168
06:17:59,689 --> 06:18:01,130
I can't even fucking comprehend it.

5169
06:18:12,200 --> 06:18:14,200
Earning more than a mosquito doctor.

5170
06:18:14,200 --> 06:18:16,200
Way more than a mosquito doctor, dude.

5171
06:18:16,840 --> 06:18:17,959
A thousand times more.

5172
06:18:33,979 --> 06:18:35,740
$900 over six hours.

5173
06:18:40,400 --> 06:18:41,759
Jesus fucking Christ.

5174
06:18:53,709 --> 06:18:58,750
Right, right.

5175
06:18:58,750 --> 06:18:59,869
You make me sick.

5176
06:18:59,869 --> 06:19:00,509
L-U-L.

5177
06:19:05,259 --> 06:19:09,560
I'm sorry you feel that way.

5178
06:19:09,560 --> 06:19:13,290
I'm trying.

5179
06:19:15,099 --> 06:19:17,580
This year, 2019 especially.

5180
06:19:28,029 --> 06:19:28,909
He's close.

5181
06:19:29,790 --> 06:19:30,909
I'm not going to cry.

5182
06:19:34,599 --> 06:19:35,159
Cry.

5183
06:19:39,279 --> 06:19:40,159
How do you make a knot?

5184
06:19:43,389 --> 06:19:44,189
Yes, you are.

5185
06:19:44,189 --> 06:19:45,630
I'm not close to crying.

5186
06:20:06,330 --> 06:20:08,250
Tie it off completely.

5187
06:20:15,799 --> 06:20:17,799
This is what the real thing should look like.

5188
06:20:17,799 --> 06:20:19,000
Does your knot look the same?

5189
06:20:20,270 --> 06:20:23,310
It's a little long, but it will get the job done.

5190
06:20:23,950 --> 06:20:27,159
Cry or pre-record it.

5191
06:20:27,959 --> 06:20:37,319
Crying will make you feel better.

5192
06:20:37,319 --> 06:20:48,520
Put a round.

5193
06:20:57,389 --> 06:21:00,880
All right, leave it.

5194
06:21:00,880 --> 06:21:01,840
I'll get the hiccups now.

5195
06:21:05,680 --> 06:21:07,200
Oh, I got the fucking hiccups.

5196
06:21:07,759 --> 06:21:19,259
This goes through here, there.

5197
06:21:20,860 --> 06:21:23,020
All right, so that is situated.

5198
06:21:23,020 --> 06:21:23,500
It's done.

5199
06:21:24,220 --> 06:21:26,779
He's trying to hold back the tears.

5200
06:21:31,790 --> 06:21:34,029
Seven years ago when I made my first YouTube video.

5201
06:21:36,330 --> 06:21:42,860
Never in a million fucking years did I think I'd be sitting down in Las Vegas

5202
06:21:44,619 --> 06:21:46,139
with a ton of fucking supporters.

5203
06:21:47,549 --> 06:21:50,169
Just giving me fucking money.

5204
06:21:52,090 --> 06:21:53,049
Never in a million years.

5205
06:21:59,419 --> 06:22:00,139
Ever.

5206
06:22:00,139 --> 06:22:11,479
He's getting reversed cyberbullying.

5207
06:22:15,659 --> 06:22:17,580
I got a free vibe this video.

5208
06:22:22,509 --> 06:22:25,869
Well, if you never think it's worth doing, don't up your subscription.

5209
06:22:25,869 --> 06:22:27,229
I've said that before and I'll say it again.

5210
06:22:29,689 --> 06:22:35,529
If you watch and over time, over months or six months, two months, three months,

5211
06:22:35,529 --> 06:22:37,770
one month and you're like, I don't care anymore.

5212
06:22:37,770 --> 06:22:39,049
This is not fucking fun anymore.

5213
06:22:40,169 --> 06:22:43,689
Do not pay me any more money because I wouldn't deserve it at that point.

5214
06:22:44,650 --> 06:22:46,479
Hi.

5215
06:22:59,180 --> 06:23:07,680
That's it, right?

5216
06:23:09,500 --> 06:23:10,139
What's next?

5217
06:23:10,939 --> 06:23:19,549
I got two of these, right?

5218
06:23:19,549 --> 06:23:20,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5219
06:23:25,689 --> 06:23:27,689
Thank you butterdurk for the $15.

5220
06:23:27,689 --> 06:23:29,529
Jerma, I don't leave your stream saying that was fun.

5221
06:23:29,529 --> 06:23:31,610
I leave your stream saying no, please don't leave.

5222
06:23:32,409 --> 06:23:33,770
It's a unique feeling.

5223
06:23:33,770 --> 06:23:36,330
Nothing else has ever replicated.

5224
06:23:47,389 --> 06:23:47,790
Thank you.

5225
06:23:48,509 --> 06:23:51,950
Uh, also, uh, nksaur says, I like that you hold,

5226
06:23:51,950 --> 06:23:55,630
you like that you must hold you accountable for making quality content.

5227
06:23:56,349 --> 06:23:58,080
Well, what else are you paying for?

5228
06:23:59,869 --> 06:24:00,349
You know what I mean?

5229
06:24:02,409 --> 06:24:03,689
Think, like really think about that.

5230
06:24:03,689 --> 06:24:04,330
Like think about it.

5231
06:24:05,689 --> 06:24:07,240
Like, oh, thanks for the sub.

5232
06:24:07,240 --> 06:24:08,119
Thanks for the sub.

5233
06:24:08,119 --> 06:24:09,080
Thanks for the sub, man.

5234
06:24:09,639 --> 06:24:10,810
Like, what are you paying for?

5235
06:24:19,479 --> 06:24:27,069
You have actively decided on your own free will to continuously,

5236
06:24:28,029 --> 06:24:36,799
continuously for a lot of people, pay to my bank account a monthly payment.

5237
06:24:41,049 --> 06:24:45,200
At some point, you have to think about like, what, what am I paying for?

5238
06:24:45,840 --> 06:24:49,580
Just, oh, I want to give you money because I'd like you.

5239
06:24:49,580 --> 06:24:50,080
Okay.

5240
06:24:51,020 --> 06:24:52,459
Thank you so much.

5241
06:24:52,459 --> 06:24:54,720
But what are you paying for?

5242
06:25:01,450 --> 06:25:03,849
That's something that I fucking think about all the time.

5243
06:25:10,189 --> 06:25:11,069
Which is why?

5244
06:25:11,069 --> 06:25:12,159
Oh, do this.

5245
06:25:12,159 --> 06:25:12,720
I want to try that.

5246
06:25:12,720 --> 06:25:13,279
I want to try this.

5247
06:25:13,279 --> 06:25:14,240
I want to try something like that.

5248
06:25:14,240 --> 06:25:15,119
I want to do something new.

5249
06:25:15,119 --> 06:25:16,159
I want to bring something new.

5250
06:25:16,159 --> 06:25:17,200
I want to let's, let's do a skit.

5251
06:25:17,200 --> 06:25:18,479
Let's do a fucking community event.

5252
06:25:19,200 --> 06:25:20,889
That's why I want to do that shit.

5253
06:25:44,319 --> 06:25:53,709
That's $500 from Deuce the Gamer.

5254
06:26:02,110 --> 06:26:02,590
What you've

5255
06:26:10,169 --> 06:26:14,759
five, that's some, I think that's the most amount of money I've ever seen in one bit.

5256
06:26:16,009 --> 06:26:17,610
That's fucking ridiculous, man.

5257
06:26:19,919 --> 06:26:21,360
That's ridiculous.

5258
06:26:22,159 --> 06:26:26,000
That is like a month of fucking like a part-time income.

5259
06:26:27,209 --> 06:26:28,250
Like two or three weeks.

5260
06:26:33,680 --> 06:26:43,759
Uh, and Deuce the Gamer says, uh, oh yeah, before I go, please do a Fortnite dance.

5261
06:26:44,400 --> 06:26:47,369
I told you my favorite for entire.

5262
06:26:47,369 --> 06:26:52,380
Uh, yeah, this one, the one with the fucking kid with the backpack on this one.

5263
06:27:04,240 --> 06:27:09,869
There's a lot coming.

5264
06:27:10,750 --> 06:27:16,669
Uh, and a ton of you people have paid for it.

5265
06:27:18,279 --> 06:27:23,150
Already like a ton of you guys have paid for it.

5266
06:27:25,319 --> 06:27:28,520
I hope the things that you will see in the next couple of months.

5267
06:27:29,319 --> 06:27:31,080
Do you think of fun?

5268
06:27:31,080 --> 06:27:32,840
That's all I can say.

5269
06:27:37,360 --> 06:27:45,450
The power of Christ compels you.

5270
06:27:48,029 --> 06:27:50,270
Streamer does anything for money.

5271
06:27:51,950 --> 06:27:54,270
It's five fucking hundred dollars.

5272
06:28:04,000 --> 06:28:07,200
I can't, I still can't fucking believe it whenever it happens, man.

5273
06:28:07,840 --> 06:28:10,880
That's the most I think I've ever seen in my life.

5274
06:28:10,880 --> 06:28:20,799
Show your dick.

5275
06:28:22,240 --> 06:28:27,279
Why would I show my dick now of all the times to ask for that?

5276
06:28:28,669 --> 06:28:30,909
Why would that happen now?

5277
06:28:31,790 --> 06:28:34,970
I can't even pay attention to this.

5278
06:28:54,840 --> 06:28:55,080
All right.

5279
06:28:55,080 --> 06:28:55,799
Where did these go?

5280
06:29:04,590 --> 06:29:05,630
Make his dick cry.

5281
06:29:23,770 --> 06:29:25,689
I need, uh, I need the engine thing back.

5282
06:29:26,650 --> 06:29:32,779
Where does this go?

5283
06:29:34,090 --> 06:29:36,090
Circle through here.

5284
06:29:37,770 --> 06:29:48,490
I'm just glad you find happiness in this stream.

5285
06:29:50,330 --> 06:29:51,610
I don't have much else to say.

5286
06:29:52,330 --> 06:29:56,319
I could go off on like a tangent about it.

5287
06:29:56,319 --> 06:29:57,759
I've done it a couple times already.

5288
06:30:15,069 --> 06:30:20,169
There are some streams that when I end them, I'm lying in bed

5289
06:30:21,130 --> 06:30:25,849
and I look at the ceiling and I just say to myself,

5290
06:30:25,930 --> 06:30:27,849
holy fucking shit dude.

5291
06:30:29,919 --> 06:30:32,080
How, what happened?

5292
06:30:32,959 --> 06:30:34,240
How was that even possible?

5293
06:30:34,959 --> 06:30:36,939
This is gonna be one of them.

5294
06:30:49,310 --> 06:30:50,669
What, what happened?

5295
06:31:01,240 --> 06:31:02,680
Why are you not crying yet?

5296
06:31:03,880 --> 06:31:05,319
Because there's no reason to cry.

5297
06:31:06,119 --> 06:31:09,319
There's no, I don't have a reason to cry.

5298
06:31:10,360 --> 06:31:11,639
I have a reason to be very happy.

5299
06:31:13,560 --> 06:31:15,880
And incredibly importantly,

5300
06:31:16,599 --> 06:31:20,380
I have a lot of reasons to be very, very, very happy.

5301
06:31:21,479 --> 06:31:25,159
And a ton of the messages that I read from people are about,

5302
06:31:26,200 --> 06:31:29,000
hey dude, uh, my life like sucks.

5303
06:31:42,540 --> 06:31:43,580
He's getting close.

5304
06:31:48,490 --> 06:31:49,930
And it's like, fuck man.

5305
06:31:52,360 --> 06:31:54,119
Like, oh, like I've had such a hard time.

5306
06:31:54,119 --> 06:31:56,520
Like this stream is so much fun.

5307
06:31:56,520 --> 06:31:59,950
And you don't think that I think about that?

5308
06:31:59,950 --> 06:32:00,909
Like all the fucking time?

5309
06:32:00,909 --> 06:32:01,470
You know what I mean?

5310
06:32:01,470 --> 06:32:20,840
And then I see like huge, fucking huge amounts of money

5311
06:32:20,840 --> 06:32:21,560
coming to the stream.

5312
06:32:21,560 --> 06:32:24,299
It's like, god damn.

5313
06:32:28,110 --> 06:32:29,709
It better be fucking worth it.

5314
06:32:30,270 --> 06:32:31,150
It better be.

5315
06:32:33,200 --> 06:32:35,119
I'm just happy to fucking hang out and be here, man.

5316
06:32:38,889 --> 06:32:40,569
You're trying to get it.

5317
06:32:40,569 --> 06:32:41,849
You almost got it.

5318
06:32:41,849 --> 06:32:42,409
It was close.

5319
06:32:43,130 --> 06:32:44,090
It was real close.

5320
06:32:48,250 --> 06:32:49,930
You made yourselves cry.

5321
06:32:52,990 --> 06:32:53,790
But that's for real.

5322
06:32:56,360 --> 06:33:02,970
I actually, I saw a clip of Creparian who mentioned something similar.

5323
06:33:04,110 --> 06:33:07,229
And I have a lot of respect for Creparian.

5324
06:33:07,229 --> 06:33:09,229
He's kind of an OG in this space, right?

5325
06:33:10,599 --> 06:33:15,450
But it's like, whenever I hear something like that,

5326
06:33:16,479 --> 06:33:18,319
I start to internalize it, you know?

5327
06:33:18,319 --> 06:33:21,119
And I try to think about, you know,

5328
06:33:21,119 --> 06:33:22,400
I want to make sure that person's all right.

5329
06:33:22,400 --> 06:33:23,680
I mean, the person's having fun.

5330
06:33:23,680 --> 06:33:24,400
The person's okay.

5331
06:33:24,400 --> 06:33:24,880
You know what I mean?

5332
06:33:25,759 --> 06:33:29,599
It's something that you think about a lot.

5333
06:33:33,770 --> 06:33:36,250
It just got to that donation now.

5334
06:33:36,250 --> 06:33:37,529
Yeah, there it is.

5335
06:33:38,169 --> 06:33:39,209
Five fucking hundred.

5336
06:33:44,060 --> 06:33:47,290
But yeah, if you think of that,

5337
06:33:47,290 --> 06:33:49,450
that's something that I'm not the only one, you know?

5338
06:33:49,450 --> 06:33:52,169
There's plenty of other streamers and content creators

5339
06:33:52,169 --> 06:33:55,069
that take a lot of, you know, pride

5340
06:33:55,069 --> 06:33:59,950
and a lot of, they're like, wow,

5341
06:33:59,950 --> 06:34:01,470
I'm actually helping somebody.

5342
06:34:01,470 --> 06:34:03,549
Like, it means a lot to hear that.

5343
06:34:05,310 --> 06:34:06,750
I heard Crip say that the other day

5344
06:34:06,750 --> 06:34:07,950
and I was like, holy shit.

5345
06:34:07,950 --> 06:34:09,790
I'm like, all right, well, respect for you.

5346
06:34:09,790 --> 06:34:12,189
Just increased by fucking a thousand percent.

5347
06:34:12,189 --> 06:34:12,669
You know what I mean?

5348
06:34:17,020 --> 06:34:19,360
But Crip is Crip.

5349
06:34:19,360 --> 06:34:20,799
You know, everybody knows who that is.

5350
06:34:21,680 --> 06:34:26,270
He's going to retire.

5351
06:34:27,389 --> 06:34:28,270
Not in the plans at all.

5352
06:34:31,180 --> 06:34:32,540
Who is preparing it?

5353
06:34:32,540 --> 06:34:33,580
You don't, Crip?

5354
06:34:33,580 --> 06:34:34,459
You don't know who Crip is?

5355
06:34:34,459 --> 06:34:34,939
Come on.

5356
06:34:37,229 --> 06:34:38,110
You don't know who Crip.

5357
06:34:38,110 --> 06:34:39,549
He's like Hearthstone, Diablo,

5358
06:34:40,270 --> 06:34:41,150
Path of Exile.

5359
06:34:41,950 --> 06:34:46,889
I've never heard of that person in my life.

5360
06:34:46,889 --> 06:34:50,639
Crip is a salty baby who cries over children's card games.

5361
06:34:50,639 --> 06:34:57,200
Well, excuse me.

5362
06:34:58,080 --> 06:35:00,240
What am I doing right now?

5363
06:35:01,439 --> 06:35:02,959
What is this?

5364
06:35:03,759 --> 06:35:05,919
This is, this is an adult game.

5365
06:35:07,840 --> 06:35:13,159
But for real, you guys are fucking awesome.

5366
06:35:13,159 --> 06:35:14,200
Don't ever think differently.

5367
06:35:15,630 --> 06:35:18,330
There's so many different kinds of people.

5368
06:35:18,330 --> 06:35:21,159
So many different points of views.

5369
06:35:21,159 --> 06:35:22,919
So many different fucking people here.

5370
06:35:22,919 --> 06:35:24,599
I don't even know who Crip is.

5371
06:35:24,919 --> 06:35:26,040
So many different points of views.

5372
06:35:26,040 --> 06:35:27,560
So many different fucking people here.

5373
06:35:29,209 --> 06:35:32,729
This channel is, over the last three years,

5374
06:35:35,720 --> 06:35:36,759
has grown a lot.

5375
06:35:36,759 --> 06:35:39,080
And it's gotten to a point where there's so many people here.

5376
06:35:40,040 --> 06:35:41,159
Just happy you're fucking here.

5377
06:35:42,439 --> 06:35:42,919
And that's it.

5378
06:35:44,880 --> 06:35:46,119
Let's finish the car.

5379
06:35:50,909 --> 06:35:52,189
I am a people.

5380
06:35:53,869 --> 06:35:55,709
Cry, cry, cry, cry.

5381
06:35:58,639 --> 06:35:58,880
All right.

5382
06:36:00,080 --> 06:36:01,119
What is this even here for?

5383
06:36:01,119 --> 06:36:01,840
Get this out of here.

5384
06:36:02,479 --> 06:36:08,080
And there's so many streamers and so many people

5385
06:36:08,080 --> 06:36:09,439
that are doing the same things.

5386
06:36:09,439 --> 06:36:10,560
So many people to support.

5387
06:36:10,560 --> 06:36:12,560
So many people that are worth your time.

5388
06:36:12,560 --> 06:36:16,000
It's just remarkable that a lot of you are here right now.

5389
06:36:16,959 --> 06:36:18,000
This late as well.

5390
06:36:23,520 --> 06:36:24,720
Through and down.

5391
06:36:29,419 --> 06:36:30,779
We only liked your hairstyle.

5392
06:36:36,439 --> 06:36:38,119
We almost made it, you almost, almost.

5393
06:36:38,119 --> 06:36:39,159
It got real close.

5394
06:36:39,880 --> 06:36:43,479
I could feel like the, I could feel the fucking chest pain.

5395
06:36:43,479 --> 06:36:48,349
Where it was like, hey, I'm good.

5396
06:36:48,349 --> 06:37:00,970
But it's something I think about a lot.

5397
06:37:02,669 --> 06:37:04,590
And if you think that's just a joke,

5398
06:37:05,310 --> 06:37:07,389
I'm sorry, but that's not part of the routine.

5399
06:37:11,290 --> 06:37:17,630
I found out you were streaming and I've been here since.

5400
06:37:17,630 --> 06:37:19,389
I can't, I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.

5401
06:37:20,110 --> 06:37:22,430
Thank you, Butterdirt, for real.

5402
06:37:22,430 --> 06:37:27,639
As long as we're all having fun, right?

5403
06:37:28,360 --> 06:37:32,590
That goes in, that goes forward, I hope.

5404
06:37:34,400 --> 06:37:35,119
Does that look right?

5405
06:37:39,389 --> 06:37:40,490
That looks wrong.

5406
06:37:48,349 --> 06:37:48,909
No, that's right.

5407
06:37:48,909 --> 06:37:49,389
That's right.

5408
06:37:49,389 --> 06:37:49,790
That's right.

5409
06:37:49,790 --> 06:37:50,270
I got it.

5410
06:37:50,270 --> 06:37:50,830
That's right.

5411
06:37:56,970 --> 06:37:59,369
Can't wait till you, we're here till 6 a.m.

5412
06:37:59,369 --> 06:38:01,130
Well, for however long we're here, we're here.

5413
06:38:03,240 --> 06:38:03,799
All right, hold on.

5414
06:38:03,799 --> 06:38:04,680
I gotta look at this.

5415
06:38:04,680 --> 06:38:05,959
I need this thing back.

5416
06:38:08,430 --> 06:38:10,990
I need the little fat one.

5417
06:38:17,150 --> 06:38:17,950
And there it is.

5418
06:38:21,900 --> 06:38:31,369
A little bump right across the bump.

5419
06:38:32,169 --> 06:38:34,279
Close enough, I would say.

5420
06:38:37,759 --> 06:38:40,479
Jerma, here's a dollar for your crippling chicken nugget addiction.

5421
06:38:41,119 --> 06:38:42,319
It's fucking crazy, dude.

5422
06:38:42,319 --> 06:38:43,040
I'm sorry, I know.

5423
06:38:43,599 --> 06:38:48,729
The roof still goes up.

5424
06:38:48,729 --> 06:38:49,130
It does.

5425
06:38:53,880 --> 06:38:55,720
All right, we don't need these anymore.

5426
06:38:56,360 --> 06:39:00,509
So where the hell does this go?

5427
06:39:01,069 --> 06:39:13,500
This goes in here with the, oh, this is not right.

5428
06:39:22,060 --> 06:39:22,540
Yeah, it is.

5429
06:39:23,740 --> 06:39:26,599
Ah, that was a loud noise.

5430
06:39:29,310 --> 06:39:29,630
Don't!

5431
06:39:33,840 --> 06:39:36,639
Uh, Tiny, thank you, Tiny840 for the 10 bucks.

5432
06:39:36,639 --> 06:39:39,040
I can't give nearly as much as some people have here.

5433
06:39:39,919 --> 06:39:42,639
But I just want to show my appreciation for what you do for all of us.

5434
06:39:42,639 --> 06:39:43,040
Keep it up.

5435
06:39:45,560 --> 06:39:49,159
You never expected Tiny to give a fucking huge amount of money.

5436
06:39:50,360 --> 06:39:50,680
Ever.

5437
06:39:52,029 --> 06:39:54,750
Don't ever feel obligated to pay the stream money.

5438
06:39:54,750 --> 06:39:56,430
Just, if you're here, you're here.

5439
06:39:59,319 --> 06:40:00,040
Thank you.

5440
06:40:00,040 --> 06:40:00,759
That means a lot.

5441
06:40:01,849 --> 06:40:03,689
Two dollars, one dollar, a hundred dollars.

5442
06:40:03,689 --> 06:40:05,450
Like, it's all the same.

5443
06:40:06,009 --> 06:40:09,049
Somebody decided to give money to me today.

5444
06:40:09,849 --> 06:40:15,869
Because I think about me, right?

5445
06:40:16,430 --> 06:40:20,029
If I was in a stream and giving somebody a hundred fucking dollars.

5446
06:40:29,290 --> 06:40:30,700
You know how it is.

5447
06:40:32,169 --> 06:40:32,569
Thank you.

5448
06:40:34,040 --> 06:40:34,360
Cry.

5449
06:40:36,439 --> 06:40:38,520
It almost, it almost happened.

5450
06:40:38,520 --> 06:40:40,279
It was really fucking close.

5451
06:40:40,279 --> 06:40:41,799
It was so close.

5452
06:40:41,799 --> 06:40:43,880
You don't have any idea how close that was.

5453
06:40:43,880 --> 06:40:44,439
That was like...

5454
06:40:47,799 --> 06:40:51,759
Here we go.

5455
06:40:51,759 --> 06:40:54,729
Lock it in.

5456
06:40:55,290 --> 06:41:00,459
Push him over the edge.

5457
06:41:03,560 --> 06:41:06,119
Somebody give a thousand dollars.

5458
06:41:07,240 --> 06:41:09,310
Don't do that.

5459
06:41:13,080 --> 06:41:16,680
Do not give me a thousand dollars.

5460
06:41:17,479 --> 06:41:18,599
For any reason.

5461
06:41:19,400 --> 06:41:20,119
I mean, ever.

5462
06:41:20,919 --> 06:41:23,479
All right.

5463
06:41:23,479 --> 06:41:27,049
So I can turn this.

5464
06:41:27,770 --> 06:41:30,299
Okay, it's turned.

5465
06:41:30,939 --> 06:41:34,520
This goes in there.

5466
06:41:37,389 --> 06:41:39,549
Somebody give him a thousand dollars.

5467
06:41:39,549 --> 06:41:40,909
Get him over the edge.

5468
06:41:45,529 --> 06:41:48,090
Maybe two rubber bands.

5469
06:41:48,810 --> 06:41:53,000
One, two.

5470
06:41:57,389 --> 06:41:59,549
One dollar equals one tier.

5471
06:42:00,830 --> 06:42:02,650
Two of them together.

5472
06:42:02,650 --> 06:42:03,950
Okay.

5473
06:42:03,950 --> 06:42:04,509
Double thick.

5474
06:42:14,040 --> 06:42:15,479
So these go over this.

5475
06:42:16,439 --> 06:42:19,049
Okay.

5476
06:42:19,770 --> 06:42:28,009
Around there.

5477
06:42:32,250 --> 06:42:38,590
Good.

5478
06:42:38,590 --> 06:42:39,310
Yeah, it's still there.

5479
06:42:40,029 --> 06:42:44,490
Try pulling the reverse lever of the rubber band.

5480
06:42:44,490 --> 06:42:45,369
Snaps it back.

5481
06:42:45,369 --> 06:42:46,169
It's a retrofixer.

5482
06:42:56,779 --> 06:43:03,759
Want to see the internal guts?

5483
06:43:05,790 --> 06:43:07,630
Oh, yeah.

5484
06:43:07,630 --> 06:43:10,090
It's good.

5485
06:43:10,090 --> 06:43:14,599
Try pulling this pull cord, too.

5486
06:43:14,599 --> 06:43:16,040
It should snap back as well.

5487
06:43:34,939 --> 06:43:35,580
Fifty bucks.

5488
06:43:36,400 --> 06:43:38,000
From Visual Warlock.

5489
06:43:41,979 --> 06:43:45,819
Jerma, I found your Jerma Rumble videos on YouTube and instantly became a fan.

5490
06:43:46,779 --> 06:43:48,619
You're one of the genuinely funny people on Twitch.

5491
06:43:49,340 --> 06:43:51,740
And I want to say thanks for making me laugh every time on stream.

5492
06:43:53,959 --> 06:43:55,000
Thank you, Visual Warlock.

5493
06:43:57,740 --> 06:43:59,180
Thank you, the power of the rubber bands.

5494
06:44:03,279 --> 06:44:05,119
I'm glad you found them and I'm glad you like them.

5495
06:44:05,680 --> 06:44:10,060
They're a lot of love when it's at those videos.

5496
06:44:10,939 --> 06:44:15,630
So I hold a really deep place in my heart.

5497
06:44:15,630 --> 06:44:16,349
So thank you.

5498
06:44:17,150 --> 06:44:18,250
Glad you enjoy them.

5499
06:44:23,479 --> 06:44:24,840
The gadgets are complete.

5500
06:44:28,759 --> 06:44:29,880
Cry incoming.

5501
06:44:31,799 --> 06:44:32,360
All right.

5502
06:44:32,360 --> 06:44:33,240
Almost done with the car.

5503
06:44:34,360 --> 06:44:36,360
Main base is time.

5504
06:44:37,000 --> 06:44:38,759
Get the fuck out of here.

5505
06:44:41,639 --> 06:44:42,520
J and I.

5506
06:44:44,810 --> 06:44:47,049
I, we need the middle pieces here.

5507
06:44:51,770 --> 06:44:52,889
Incoming cry.

5508
06:44:57,529 --> 06:44:59,369
I'll give all my bits if he cries.

5509
06:45:00,090 --> 06:45:06,520
Why do you want me to cry?

5510
06:45:06,520 --> 06:45:08,040
Oh, when is he gonna cry?

5511
06:45:09,159 --> 06:45:10,970
I'm not going to cry.

5512
06:45:23,549 --> 06:45:24,509
I know it's getting late.

5513
06:45:25,310 --> 06:45:26,110
10, 11, 12.

5514
06:45:26,110 --> 06:45:27,709
It's almost 1 a.m. Eastern.

5515
06:45:27,709 --> 06:45:28,830
I'm sorry it's getting late.

5516
06:45:29,630 --> 06:45:32,270
Let's try to get this done quick.

5517
06:45:32,990 --> 06:45:34,810
Give me the next two hours.

5518
06:45:46,090 --> 06:45:48,490
No cry, no topless, no dick.

5519
06:45:48,490 --> 06:45:49,369
Fails bad man.

5520
06:45:59,849 --> 06:46:26,000
By the way, that is a thousand dollars from Deuce the Gamer.

5521
06:46:26,000 --> 06:46:26,639
Thousand bucks.

5522
06:46:27,680 --> 06:46:28,479
A thousand.

5523
06:46:29,360 --> 06:46:30,080
Not a hundred.

5524
06:46:31,040 --> 06:46:32,400
Not a five hundred.

5525
06:46:33,040 --> 06:46:33,900
A thousand.

5526
06:46:37,180 --> 06:46:39,819
One thousand fucking dollars.

5527
06:46:49,240 --> 06:46:50,360
Fucking grand.

5528
06:46:50,919 --> 06:46:52,040
A grand.

5529
06:46:55,869 --> 06:46:56,990
Deuce the Gamer says,

5530
06:46:59,209 --> 06:47:01,209
Here's a few more to round it out.

5531
06:47:01,209 --> 06:47:02,090
Thanks for everything.

5532
06:47:02,090 --> 06:47:03,049
You're my expensive.

5533
06:47:07,389 --> 06:47:08,430
Holy shit.

5534
06:47:09,229 --> 06:47:19,790
Are you kidding me?

5535
06:47:22,029 --> 06:47:24,270
A thousand fucking dollars.

5536
06:47:24,909 --> 06:47:26,110
A thousand.

5537
06:47:26,750 --> 06:47:33,979
Deuce the Gamer, thank you so much, man.

5538
06:47:36,319 --> 06:47:38,959
Rounding out his one thousand fucking dollars.

5539
06:47:50,599 --> 06:47:51,319
Jesus.

5540
06:47:52,279 --> 06:47:58,479
A hundred thousand fucking bits, man.

5541
06:47:58,479 --> 06:47:59,599
I've never seen that before.

5542
06:48:00,159 --> 06:48:06,830
He already left the chat?

5543
06:48:16,439 --> 06:48:17,880
Jesus Christ.

5544
06:48:35,659 --> 06:48:37,500
I've never seen yellow before.

5545
06:48:38,139 --> 06:48:40,560
For a hundred thousand fucking bits in one day.

5546
06:48:44,720 --> 06:48:46,080
A thousand fucking dollars.

5547
06:48:48,400 --> 06:48:49,520
You up, you paid,

5548
06:48:49,520 --> 06:48:52,479
you alone paid for the fucking green screen stream, dude.

5549
06:48:53,200 --> 06:48:55,580
Honestly, God, that's not even a joke.

5550
06:48:58,779 --> 06:48:59,659
That's gold.

5551
06:49:12,919 --> 06:49:13,639
Deuce, that's...

5552
06:49:14,599 --> 06:49:17,819
Do you think you can buy them?

5553
06:49:18,540 --> 06:49:21,799
Buy like a bed for a thousand dollars.

5554
06:49:22,680 --> 06:49:25,439
That's like a car payment.

5555
06:49:29,759 --> 06:49:33,919
You can buy like so many things at a thousand dollars.

5556
06:49:33,919 --> 06:49:35,200
You can buy like a Vive.

5557
06:49:44,799 --> 06:49:46,080
That's so much money.

5558
06:49:52,380 --> 06:49:54,060
Deuce the Gamer, I'm not sure that

5559
06:49:55,840 --> 06:49:59,599
your amount will ever be fucking surpassed in one day.

5560
06:50:12,520 --> 06:50:28,990
MultiTrip just gave fifty bucks.

5561
06:50:31,419 --> 06:50:32,459
Yeah, Jeremy, you're funny.

5562
06:50:32,459 --> 06:50:33,180
Funny looking.

5563
06:50:33,819 --> 06:50:36,299
As long as it makes me happy, dude.

5564
06:50:36,299 --> 06:50:39,419
I'm fucking glad to take your fifty fucking dollars.

5565
06:50:41,549 --> 06:50:42,110
Jesus.

5566
06:50:42,990 --> 06:50:44,639
Thank you, MultiTrip.

5567
06:50:45,759 --> 06:51:00,540
Waiting for the cry.

5568
06:51:00,540 --> 06:51:02,189
I'm not gonna...

5569
06:51:02,830 --> 06:51:04,060
I'm just...

5570
06:51:04,060 --> 06:51:09,360
I'm just happy and kind of floored.

5571
06:51:10,080 --> 06:51:19,900
There's people in this world that deem this stream worth a thousand dollars.

5572
06:51:20,459 --> 06:51:25,919
I'm speeding off into the fucking sunset.

5573
06:51:31,229 --> 06:51:32,590
I'm gonna fold this down.

5574
06:51:34,799 --> 06:51:35,040
In.

5575
06:51:38,189 --> 06:51:40,990
He's challenging his audience to beat a thousand dollars.

5576
06:51:40,990 --> 06:51:43,069
No, God, that's so much money.

5577
06:51:44,110 --> 06:51:45,790
I'm not challenging anybody.

5578
06:51:48,590 --> 06:51:49,069
Show them.

5579
06:51:49,069 --> 06:51:50,189
Show them how cool you are.

5580
06:51:52,439 --> 06:51:53,319
Come on, harder.

5581
06:51:53,880 --> 06:51:54,279
Do it.

5582
06:51:54,840 --> 06:52:01,709
It's done.

5583
06:52:02,430 --> 06:52:12,330
This goes in the front here, right in the front door.

5584
06:52:15,799 --> 06:52:16,439
Right?

5585
06:52:16,439 --> 06:52:18,189
Of course.

5586
06:52:21,419 --> 06:52:22,700
Now we can flip the piece over,

5587
06:52:22,700 --> 06:52:25,740
make sure the lock doesn't fall out of the slot when you do.

5588
06:52:25,740 --> 06:52:26,380
I did.

5589
06:52:26,939 --> 06:52:42,509
As this piece folds together, I fall asleep on stream.

5590
06:52:43,479 --> 06:52:45,319
God, I'm gonna probably die.

5591
06:52:47,419 --> 06:52:59,770
So this needs to go up here.

5592
06:53:02,830 --> 06:53:04,349
I can still hear that car.

5593
06:53:05,950 --> 06:53:06,830
Yeah, me too.

5594
06:53:06,830 --> 06:53:08,029
I can still hear the car too.

5595
06:53:09,520 --> 06:53:09,919
I don't know.

5596
06:53:09,919 --> 06:53:11,119
I don't know what he's doing.

5597
06:53:11,119 --> 06:53:12,560
He's just like speeding around.

5598
06:53:13,360 --> 06:53:14,400
I'm a psycho.

5599
06:53:14,400 --> 06:53:15,040
What do you have to be?

5600
06:53:15,840 --> 06:53:21,229
Okay.

5601
06:53:21,229 --> 06:53:22,830
Does it match?

5602
06:53:24,729 --> 06:53:25,930
One piece from sheet.

5603
06:53:25,930 --> 06:53:32,090
I got it.

5604
06:53:32,090 --> 06:53:42,360
Throw it all up.

5605
06:53:59,680 --> 06:54:03,520
If everyone donates 50 bits, we can surpass the record.

5606
06:54:06,119 --> 06:54:07,080
My Lord.

5607
06:54:08,880 --> 06:54:09,520
I'm impressed.

5608
06:54:09,520 --> 06:54:10,319
Yes, I am.

5609
06:54:10,319 --> 06:54:12,319
I'm in Pacific Standard Time.

5610
06:54:12,880 --> 06:54:16,810
All right.

5611
06:54:16,810 --> 06:54:32,459
So this comes across here, here, that, there.

5612
06:54:33,259 --> 06:54:35,610
Should be good to go.

5613
06:54:36,330 --> 06:54:42,990
Lay the triangle flat once it's connected.

5614
06:54:45,020 --> 06:54:46,619
And then bring this up.

5615
06:54:50,490 --> 06:54:51,450
Fold it down.

5616
06:54:51,450 --> 06:54:52,409
Fold this down.

5617
06:54:54,959 --> 06:54:55,599
And in.

5618
06:54:58,569 --> 06:54:59,930
Inside.

5619
06:55:04,509 --> 06:55:05,150
Looks good.

5620
06:55:10,810 --> 06:55:11,770
The other piece.

5621
06:55:16,619 --> 06:55:17,099
Sorry.

5622
06:55:17,099 --> 06:55:18,299
I feel like even 50 bits.

5623
06:55:19,180 --> 06:55:26,439
You guys are too much for me, man.

5624
06:55:27,159 --> 06:55:32,080
I gave mine really early.

5625
06:55:32,080 --> 06:55:34,400
I think I'm going to go make like a tuna fucking sandwich.

5626
06:55:35,200 --> 06:55:38,650
Like a tuna tortilla.

5627
06:55:39,369 --> 06:55:43,340
Let's get those bits.

5628
06:55:48,909 --> 06:55:49,310
You know what?

5629
06:55:49,310 --> 06:55:49,950
Tuna what?

5630
06:55:54,810 --> 06:55:55,529
I didn't fold it.

5631
06:55:55,529 --> 06:55:56,009
That's okay.

5632
06:55:59,790 --> 06:56:01,790
So this goes in here.

5633
06:56:02,509 --> 06:56:05,180
Just like that.

5634
06:56:07,979 --> 06:56:09,740
Ah, you fucking idiot.

5635
06:56:29,529 --> 06:56:35,259
Uh, Amnestic OW gave 20 subs.

5636
06:56:36,799 --> 06:56:38,159
Oh, we got another one.

5637
06:56:38,159 --> 06:56:39,279
Amnestic OW.

5638
06:56:44,139 --> 06:56:45,659
Amnestic Overwatch.

5639
06:56:46,799 --> 06:56:48,639
Amnestic OWO.

5640
06:56:51,290 --> 06:56:53,049
Made me 20 fucking community subs.

5641
06:56:53,610 --> 06:56:54,009
Jesus.

5642
06:56:54,650 --> 06:56:55,130
Criminic.

5643
06:56:58,569 --> 06:56:59,290
Turn it around.

5644
06:57:02,090 --> 06:57:02,889
Thank you, Amnestic.

5645
06:57:03,529 --> 06:57:05,930
For your huge fucking contribution.

5646
06:57:05,930 --> 06:57:06,569
My God.

5647
06:57:07,369 --> 06:57:09,630
How many more for new emotes?

5648
06:57:10,759 --> 06:57:14,040
Um, oh my God.

5649
06:57:29,529 --> 06:57:30,569
Five, four, three, two.

5650
06:57:31,209 --> 06:57:34,250
There were like 500 subs.

5651
06:57:37,610 --> 06:57:40,799
Five tonight.

5652
06:57:40,799 --> 06:57:43,840
Just tonight.

5653
06:57:59,049 --> 06:57:59,610
My God.

5654
06:58:06,939 --> 06:58:07,979
What the fuck?

5655
06:58:10,540 --> 06:58:12,860
I'm going to get a tuna sandwich, man.

5656
06:58:12,860 --> 06:58:14,700
I'm going to go eat some tuna fish.

5657
06:58:14,700 --> 06:58:16,380
Kyra Toby just gave a hundred dollars.

5658
06:58:17,340 --> 06:58:19,419
Kyra Toby has given two hundred dollars tonight.

5659
06:58:20,139 --> 06:58:21,500
How high can we go?

5660
06:58:22,299 --> 06:58:23,099
That's not up to me.

5661
06:58:23,659 --> 06:58:26,459
I thank you for the fucking hundred bucks.

5662
06:58:26,459 --> 06:58:27,740
I'm going to go get a tuna sandwich.

5663
06:58:28,540 --> 06:58:29,439
I'll be right back.

5664
06:58:31,200 --> 06:58:35,720
Thank you for the fucking hundred bucks, Kyra Toby.

5665
06:58:40,959 --> 06:58:41,599
I'll be right back.

5666
06:58:42,240 --> 06:58:43,279
I need some tuna fish.

5667
06:58:45,560 --> 06:58:46,599
Oh my God.

5668
06:58:48,560 --> 06:58:51,200
20 subs from Amnestic and a hundred dollars.

5669
06:58:51,680 --> 06:58:55,439
I don't know what to do because I eat tuna fish.

5670
06:58:56,000 --> 06:58:58,720
I'll see you guys in five minutes.

5671
06:58:58,720 --> 06:59:36,380
Not even.

5672
07:02:01,099 --> 07:02:38,119
All right.

5673
07:02:38,119 --> 07:02:38,439
I'm good.

5674
07:02:50,319 --> 07:02:52,279
Okay.

5675
07:02:52,279 --> 07:02:59,919
Okay.

5676
07:02:59,919 --> 07:03:00,959
He was crying.

5677
07:03:33,639 --> 07:03:34,360
I can't.

5678
07:03:34,360 --> 07:03:42,040
How did the tears in your sandwich taste?

5679
07:03:45,630 --> 07:03:46,349
Moisture.

5680
07:03:46,349 --> 07:03:51,369
That's a tortilla.

5681
07:03:51,369 --> 07:03:51,849
Yeah, it is.

5682
07:03:51,849 --> 07:03:55,630
It's a corn tortilla because I'm trying not to eat bread

5683
07:03:56,349 --> 07:04:00,430
because every time I eat bread for some reason, I feel like shit.

5684
07:04:02,990 --> 07:04:03,549
I don't know.

5685
07:04:03,549 --> 07:04:04,430
The base is complete.

5686
07:04:04,430 --> 07:04:04,669
Okay.

5687
07:04:04,669 --> 07:04:05,069
That's it.

5688
07:04:10,490 --> 07:04:11,930
Last four pieces from I.

5689
07:04:18,810 --> 07:04:20,250
Turning into an old fucking man.

5690
07:04:22,650 --> 07:04:23,529
I am.

5691
07:04:23,529 --> 07:04:24,009
You're right.

5692
07:04:24,569 --> 07:04:32,509
Okay.

5693
07:04:35,840 --> 07:04:36,959
Seven fucking hours.

5694
07:04:36,959 --> 07:04:37,759
Holy shit.

5695
07:04:49,240 --> 07:04:50,520
Your dad's gluten intolerant.

5696
07:04:50,520 --> 07:04:51,880
He clipped all wheat and grain.

5697
07:04:51,880 --> 07:04:52,520
He feels great.

5698
07:04:53,790 --> 07:04:54,110
Yeah.

5699
07:04:54,110 --> 07:04:55,310
I mean, that's kind of the idea.

5700
07:04:56,029 --> 07:04:58,909
Seeing how I feel every time I eat bread.

5701
07:04:58,909 --> 07:05:00,990
It just I feel like shit.

5702
07:05:00,990 --> 07:05:02,990
I don't know why I haven't been able to figure it out.

5703
07:05:04,880 --> 07:05:05,599
Where is that?

5704
07:05:09,439 --> 07:05:09,840
Christ.

5705
07:05:10,639 --> 07:05:12,040
Where the fuck is that?

5706
07:05:15,689 --> 07:05:18,680
All right.

5707
07:05:18,680 --> 07:05:21,000
Oh, you're triple spotting the gas and stickers.

5708
07:05:21,000 --> 07:05:21,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5709
07:05:21,799 --> 07:05:25,560
So over here, the big one.

5710
07:06:00,490 --> 07:06:01,770
You ate that like a child.

5711
07:06:16,439 --> 07:06:17,240
Right here.

5712
07:06:17,240 --> 07:06:32,650
All the way around.

5713
07:06:32,650 --> 07:06:33,770
Beautiful.

5714
07:06:33,770 --> 07:06:35,319
Looks good.

5715
07:06:45,069 --> 07:06:48,349
Same thing with the more than once, apparently.

5716
07:06:55,360 --> 07:06:56,319
No cry.

5717
07:06:56,319 --> 07:06:57,200
No topless.

5718
07:06:57,840 --> 07:06:58,959
I ain't getting topless.

5719
07:06:58,959 --> 07:07:11,770
I'll tell you that you already.

5720
07:07:11,770 --> 07:07:12,810
Oh, my goodness.

5721
07:07:20,040 --> 07:07:22,040
A wizard just gave a hundred fucking dollars here.

5722
07:07:29,150 --> 07:07:32,270
Hundred fucking bucks from a wizard.

5723
07:07:34,680 --> 07:07:37,720
Jerma, you congratulations on being the best streamer on Twitch

5724
07:07:37,720 --> 07:07:39,560
and building such a fantastic fan base.

5725
07:07:40,919 --> 07:07:44,279
You demonstrated exceptional creativity and individuality

5726
07:07:46,169 --> 07:07:50,090
in an environment that demands mediocrity and mold fitting creators.

5727
07:07:53,000 --> 07:07:56,680
I consider you a pioneer of new era of comedy and entertainment.

5728
07:07:56,680 --> 07:07:59,400
Here's a dollar for every time you maybe cry laughing

5729
07:08:00,119 --> 07:08:02,270
or help improve a bad day week or month.

5730
07:08:02,990 --> 07:08:09,130
Thank you.

5731
07:08:11,259 --> 07:08:11,819
A wizard.

5732
07:08:13,790 --> 07:08:15,950
Master of comedies channel is a different channel,

5733
07:08:15,950 --> 07:08:18,029
but I will gladly take his reign.

5734
07:08:19,450 --> 07:08:20,250
Thank you so much.

5735
07:08:24,040 --> 07:08:25,849
That means a fucking lot.

5736
07:08:25,849 --> 07:08:26,169
Thank you.

5737
07:08:26,889 --> 07:08:29,209
For the one hundred dollars.

5738
07:08:29,770 --> 07:08:35,869
I wonder if I'm gonna have to do this to all four of them.

5739
07:08:41,180 --> 07:08:42,840
Somebody give a thousand dollars?

5740
07:08:42,840 --> 07:08:43,400
Yeah, they did.

5741
07:08:44,959 --> 07:08:47,599
Yeah, they gave a thousand fucking dollars earlier.

5742
07:08:49,080 --> 07:08:49,720
Yes, they did.

5743
07:08:52,040 --> 07:08:56,040
Oh, boy, it was a fucking insane amount of money.

5744
07:08:57,529 --> 07:08:58,970
Cry so I can leave.

5745
07:08:59,689 --> 07:09:03,639
I'm gonna cry.

5746
07:09:03,639 --> 07:09:05,880
I got a little choked.

5747
07:09:05,959 --> 07:09:15,259
But I cry.

5748
07:09:15,259 --> 07:09:16,380
You almost did.

5749
07:09:16,380 --> 07:09:17,819
I got a little choked.

5750
07:09:19,229 --> 07:09:20,590
I got a little choked.

5751
07:09:21,150 --> 07:09:22,509
I didn't cry.

5752
07:09:27,020 --> 07:09:28,619
Cry so I can croak.

5753
07:09:29,659 --> 07:09:31,580
Fuck.

5754
07:09:31,580 --> 07:09:35,240
What are you talking?

5755
07:09:40,490 --> 07:09:42,090
Cry so I can croak.

5756
07:09:45,759 --> 07:09:48,400
I forgot to sleep last night, so it's late.

5757
07:09:49,290 --> 07:09:51,849
It's one plus in the morning.

5758
07:09:51,849 --> 07:09:52,970
Easter night, I understand.

5759
07:09:53,770 --> 07:09:54,569
Have a great night.

5760
07:09:55,130 --> 07:09:56,490
Thanks for sticking around as long as you did.

5761
07:10:02,720 --> 07:10:04,319
Don't need this with a fucking cat.

5762
07:10:07,069 --> 07:10:07,569
Yeah.

5763
07:10:08,990 --> 07:10:09,490
All right.

5764
07:10:13,000 --> 07:10:13,720
Attach the...

5765
07:10:13,720 --> 07:10:14,919
These long tabs should feed by...

5766
07:10:17,599 --> 07:10:18,099
Okay.

5767
07:10:21,419 --> 07:10:25,099
Like this.

5768
07:10:26,750 --> 07:10:28,830
Okay, get the fuck away from me.

5769
07:10:29,630 --> 07:10:31,919
Pull the tabs up.

5770
07:10:35,709 --> 07:10:37,069
Little circles in the way.

5771
07:10:37,069 --> 07:10:38,509
They're staying there for good.

5772
07:10:39,389 --> 07:10:46,220
This is where the...

5773
07:10:46,220 --> 07:10:47,020
I'm gonna puke.

5774
07:10:47,020 --> 07:10:48,139
This is where the switch goes.

5775
07:10:50,619 --> 07:10:51,340
Okay.

5776
07:10:51,340 --> 07:10:54,060
Okay, good.

5777
07:10:54,779 --> 07:11:21,389
At least we'll see him puke.

5778
07:11:23,310 --> 07:11:25,069
That was a joke also.

5779
07:11:25,069 --> 07:11:26,110
I'm not going to puke.

5780
07:11:26,909 --> 07:11:29,439
Although I did just eat...

5781
07:11:29,439 --> 07:11:32,240
I did just drink like half a fucking box of wine

5782
07:11:33,040 --> 07:11:34,240
and eat tuna fish.

5783
07:11:34,240 --> 07:11:34,740
So...

5784
07:11:36,509 --> 07:11:38,189
All bets are off at this point.

5785
07:11:38,909 --> 07:11:47,330
Okay.

5786
07:11:51,470 --> 07:11:52,029
That is a...

5787
07:11:52,029 --> 07:11:53,950
That is such a puke combo.

5788
07:11:53,950 --> 07:11:54,450
You're right.

5789
07:11:56,880 --> 07:11:59,200
That is the ultimate puke combo.

5790
07:12:01,470 --> 07:12:03,229
Oh, I drank a bunch of wine.

5791
07:12:03,229 --> 07:12:05,389
Hey, and a tuna fish in the fridge.

5792
07:12:06,110 --> 07:12:08,349
Let me eat as much as I possibly can.

5793
07:12:27,150 --> 07:12:27,650
Good.

5794
07:12:28,430 --> 07:12:31,389
One, two, three, four, five.

5795
07:12:32,909 --> 07:12:37,819
Looking good.

5796
07:12:37,819 --> 07:12:38,860
What? Eat ice cream?

5797
07:12:38,860 --> 07:12:40,299
Why would I eat ice cream?

5798
07:12:40,299 --> 07:12:41,639
All right, we're done.

5799
07:12:41,639 --> 07:12:42,599
We are almost done.

5800
07:12:43,479 --> 07:12:51,639
How did I make this?

5801
07:12:51,639 --> 07:12:59,709
Something fell off.

5802
07:13:47,319 --> 07:13:47,819
In.

5803
07:13:47,819 --> 07:13:55,819
These two side tabs...

5804
07:13:55,819 --> 07:13:57,099
The bottom should be sticking on.

5805
07:13:57,740 --> 07:13:59,049
Are they gonna look okay?

5806
07:14:02,250 --> 07:14:02,810
Yeah.

5807
07:14:02,810 --> 07:14:11,150
The whole thing over.

5808
07:14:12,599 --> 07:14:13,240
Like this.

5809
07:14:14,439 --> 07:14:15,840
And it falls down.

5810
07:14:16,479 --> 07:14:20,990
And stick the side tabs into here.

5811
07:14:34,959 --> 07:14:35,459
Shit.

5812
07:14:35,840 --> 07:14:42,560
Okay, that's in.

5813
07:14:43,279 --> 07:14:51,470
That's in too.

5814
07:14:52,029 --> 07:14:58,250
So it goes all the way in, right?

5815
07:14:58,250 --> 07:14:59,930
And then it comes around the sides

5816
07:14:59,930 --> 07:15:01,130
and goes into the holes, okay?

5817
07:15:03,930 --> 07:15:13,869
Got it.

5818
07:15:13,869 --> 07:15:20,720
And then like that.

5819
07:15:20,720 --> 07:15:24,110
The Toy-Con car's body is complete.

5820
07:15:28,700 --> 07:15:29,200
The f...

5821
07:15:29,500 --> 07:15:32,029
This is it.

5822
07:15:32,569 --> 07:15:35,979
This is the end.

5823
07:15:35,979 --> 07:15:39,340
We made it.

5824
07:15:39,959 --> 07:15:46,400
We did it.

5825
07:15:47,020 --> 07:15:48,400
Boys and girls.

5826
07:15:48,400 --> 07:16:07,069
Looks good.

5827
07:16:07,069 --> 07:16:20,299
All right.

5828
07:16:20,380 --> 07:16:21,259
Bring the wheel in.

5829
07:16:22,439 --> 07:16:23,799
Lower from above.

5830
07:16:23,799 --> 07:16:26,720
Okay.

5831
07:16:26,720 --> 07:16:27,580
Get it.

5832
07:16:27,580 --> 07:16:28,380
Correct.

5833
07:16:28,380 --> 07:16:38,400
Line up R and L.

5834
07:16:40,090 --> 07:16:40,810
That's correct.

5835
07:16:40,810 --> 07:16:41,450
Right here.

5836
07:16:41,450 --> 07:18:00,750
Nav it in, right?

5837
07:18:00,750 --> 07:18:12,139
Okay, that's up all the way.

5838
07:18:12,139 --> 07:18:22,270
I'm so good at this.

5839
07:18:22,270 --> 07:18:23,869
Looks good.

5840
07:18:23,869 --> 07:18:37,229
Add the Joy-Con.

5841
07:18:37,229 --> 07:18:38,270
Get the key.

5842
07:18:38,270 --> 07:18:40,889
We're done.

5843
07:18:40,889 --> 07:19:00,240
It's done.

5844
07:19:00,240 --> 07:19:04,189
Done.

5845
07:19:04,189 --> 07:19:06,830
Well, I made a baby car wheel.

5846
07:19:06,830 --> 07:19:12,590
This goes like this straight in.

5847
07:19:12,590 --> 07:19:20,590
What an emotional moment.

5848
07:19:20,590 --> 07:19:21,849
Done.

5849
07:19:21,849 --> 07:19:22,650
I can do that too.

5850
07:19:40,880 --> 07:19:42,919
It works.

5851
07:19:42,919 --> 07:19:44,520
Next up, let's prepare the pedal.

5852
07:19:46,189 --> 07:19:47,630
I got that right here.

5853
07:19:47,630 --> 07:20:18,060
All right.

5854
07:20:18,060 --> 07:20:19,180
You can see, right?

5855
07:20:19,180 --> 07:20:24,169
It's already in.

5856
07:20:24,169 --> 07:20:37,479
Size 8.

5857
07:20:37,479 --> 07:20:40,520
I'd recommend using the TV for your first outing in the car.

5858
07:20:40,520 --> 07:20:41,479
Are you ready to play?

5859
07:20:41,479 --> 07:20:41,959
I'm...

5860
07:20:41,959 --> 07:20:42,520
It's done.

5861
07:20:42,520 --> 07:20:47,020
I did it.

5862
07:20:47,020 --> 07:20:48,619
50 bucks from Golden Cricket.

5863
07:20:49,819 --> 07:20:53,819
I was bludgeoning the beef stick earlier and I heard you choked up a bit.

5864
07:20:53,819 --> 07:20:54,779
I didn't...

5865
07:20:54,779 --> 07:20:55,500
So here you go.

5866
07:20:55,500 --> 07:20:55,979
Did you talk...

5867
07:20:55,979 --> 07:20:56,220
Wait.

5868
07:20:56,220 --> 07:20:56,860
What are you talking about?

5869
07:21:00,220 --> 07:21:02,330
All right.

5870
07:21:02,330 --> 07:21:03,450
I got my pedal.

5871
07:21:03,450 --> 07:21:04,169
It's right here.

5872
07:21:04,970 --> 07:21:06,009
Oh, I'm fucking ready.

5873
07:21:06,009 --> 07:21:06,729
Put the key in.

5874
07:21:08,779 --> 07:21:10,779
Thank you Golden Cricket for your 50 bucks.

5875
07:21:11,659 --> 07:21:12,459
Let's go.

5876
07:21:12,459 --> 07:21:13,020
Key is in.

5877
07:21:13,580 --> 07:21:15,020
I'm ready to fucking drive a car.

5878
07:21:20,970 --> 07:21:22,650
This is what you came here for.

5879
07:21:30,360 --> 07:21:33,080
Head to the nearby fuel station and fill your tank.

5880
07:21:49,040 --> 07:21:49,759
Gas station.

5881
07:21:49,759 --> 07:21:50,319
Here it comes.

5882
07:21:51,369 --> 07:21:53,130
Open world adventure game.

5883
07:21:56,279 --> 07:21:56,840
How do you...

5884
07:21:56,840 --> 07:21:57,720
I don't have a brake.

5885
07:21:58,439 --> 07:22:05,930
I don't have brake.

5886
07:22:05,930 --> 07:22:06,729
There's no brake.

5887
07:22:23,549 --> 07:22:24,990
Hold on the reverse lever.

5888
07:22:25,630 --> 07:22:28,000
What's the reverse lever?

5889
07:22:28,000 --> 07:22:28,319
This?

5890
07:22:29,639 --> 07:22:31,080
Oh, shit.

5891
07:22:32,040 --> 07:22:44,860
One of the side levers you can use the hose to fuel up.

5892
07:22:45,659 --> 07:23:22,590
Got it.

5893
07:23:22,590 --> 07:23:23,310
Got it.

5894
07:23:23,310 --> 07:23:31,500
Make the game huge.

5895
07:23:32,619 --> 07:23:43,639
Wait, you can't see the wheel.

5896
07:23:45,180 --> 07:23:45,900
There.

5897
07:23:45,900 --> 07:23:57,799
Fill the tank up.

5898
07:23:58,439 --> 07:24:04,939
Get rid of face cam.

5899
07:24:05,819 --> 07:24:06,619
Okay.

5900
07:24:06,619 --> 07:24:17,159
Okay, here we go.

5901
07:24:17,959 --> 07:24:19,580
Now what?

5902
07:24:20,220 --> 07:24:29,580
Build a car wash.

5903
07:24:29,580 --> 07:24:31,500
Where do you build a car wash?

5904
07:24:32,299 --> 07:24:41,639
Complete all the missions.

5905
07:24:42,200 --> 07:24:44,240
What the fuck are you talking about?

5906
07:25:06,080 --> 07:25:07,040
Get on the road.

5907
07:25:07,840 --> 07:25:08,799
Get on the road.

5908
07:25:18,540 --> 07:25:21,180
Hey, so we made it to the road here.

5909
07:25:22,060 --> 07:25:22,860
Let's get up here.

5910
07:25:24,299 --> 07:25:26,029
Can I help you?

5911
07:25:26,669 --> 07:25:31,279
Can I help you?

5912
07:25:31,279 --> 07:25:32,000
What are you doing?

5913
07:25:32,799 --> 07:25:41,759
Are you going to say something or what?

5914
07:25:42,840 --> 07:25:44,840
Can anybody even see me in here?

5915
07:25:45,560 --> 07:25:48,040
No, I got my camera set up perfectly.

5916
07:25:53,849 --> 07:25:55,369
What the fuck was that?

5917
07:25:56,330 --> 07:26:16,250
Hey, breath of the wild.

5918
07:26:16,250 --> 07:26:19,560
You can go to the hole in one, bro.

5919
07:26:20,279 --> 07:26:40,119
All right, so where do I go from here?

5920
07:26:41,080 --> 07:26:46,669
What does this do?

5921
07:26:47,229 --> 07:26:50,119
Should I go inside?

5922
07:26:50,119 --> 07:26:51,720
Very generous traction.

5923
07:26:52,599 --> 07:26:54,200
Where do I go?

5924
07:26:54,919 --> 07:26:59,880
All right, we're going to go this way.

5925
07:27:00,680 --> 07:27:10,400
There's so much latency.

5926
07:27:16,029 --> 07:27:19,639
Make the game bigger.

5927
07:27:19,639 --> 07:27:20,520
What do you want to do?

5928
07:27:21,560 --> 07:27:23,529
There you go.

5929
07:27:24,250 --> 07:27:38,599
There.

5930
07:27:39,639 --> 07:27:40,919
Are we having fun?

5931
07:27:40,919 --> 07:27:42,040
Are we having fun yet?

5932
07:27:42,919 --> 07:27:51,150
All right, let's go this way.

5933
07:27:52,590 --> 07:27:53,950
Let's explore the open world.

5934
07:27:54,669 --> 07:28:01,000
Okay.

5935
07:28:02,639 --> 07:28:04,560
Desert area 0 of 8.

5936
07:28:17,610 --> 07:28:18,490
This is kind of fun.

5937
07:28:22,599 --> 07:28:23,720
This is kind of fun.

5938
07:28:34,200 --> 07:28:34,919
Pull the lever.

5939
07:28:37,799 --> 07:28:38,439
Tornado.

5940
07:28:39,159 --> 07:28:40,680
Tornado, pub champ.

5941
07:28:41,240 --> 07:28:42,200
Pub champ.

5942
07:28:52,490 --> 07:28:53,369
That's so delayed.

5943
07:28:57,959 --> 07:28:58,840
Find the flag.

5944
07:29:09,439 --> 07:29:10,720
Drive up the pyramid.

5945
07:29:10,720 --> 07:29:11,200
You got it.

5946
07:29:12,159 --> 07:29:19,470
Just don't want to fucking gas.

5947
07:29:20,909 --> 07:29:21,630
Hold the cord.

5948
07:29:30,639 --> 07:29:31,279
Give me the flag.

5949
07:29:31,279 --> 07:29:31,919
Give me the flag.

5950
07:29:33,529 --> 07:29:34,409
I win.

5951
07:29:35,209 --> 07:29:49,790
You got to move.

5952
07:29:49,790 --> 07:29:51,229
Okay, that was fun.

5953
07:30:03,580 --> 07:30:04,860
Go in the pyramid.

5954
07:30:23,639 --> 07:30:24,279
Inside.

5955
07:30:24,279 --> 07:30:24,759
There it is.

5956
07:30:28,220 --> 07:30:29,259
Oh, I broke it.

5957
07:30:29,259 --> 07:30:30,139
Did I break it?

5958
07:30:30,139 --> 07:30:30,700
No, it's fine.

5959
07:30:39,639 --> 07:30:41,319
Get in the pyramid, please.

5960
07:30:42,200 --> 07:30:48,319
Oh, there's a fucking boulder in the way.

5961
07:30:57,080 --> 07:30:58,040
Holy shit.

5962
07:30:58,599 --> 07:31:05,880
I just got a treasure chest.

5963
07:31:06,599 --> 07:31:11,099
We're an official treasure hunter now.

5964
07:31:11,900 --> 07:31:18,860
So where do I go from here?

5965
07:31:19,659 --> 07:31:29,680
Why has it stopped going so fast?

5966
07:31:33,290 --> 07:31:33,610
Okay.

5967
07:31:50,569 --> 07:31:54,189
Gas.

5968
07:31:54,189 --> 07:31:55,150
We did it.

5969
07:31:55,150 --> 07:32:07,360
I've been holding the wheelie for at least 60 seconds.

5970
07:32:09,560 --> 07:32:10,520
Oh, dice.

5971
07:32:11,240 --> 07:32:14,409
Try to roll die until it adds up to 10.

5972
07:32:15,209 --> 07:32:26,060
That's 6, 12.

5973
07:32:26,060 --> 07:32:26,939
That's not right.

5974
07:32:27,819 --> 07:32:32,360
That's 6, 12.

5975
07:32:32,360 --> 07:32:33,240
That's not correct.

5976
07:32:34,040 --> 07:32:45,630
Ay, yi, yi.

5977
07:32:45,630 --> 07:32:46,270
Gas.

5978
07:32:46,830 --> 07:32:52,009
I need another...

5979
07:33:01,900 --> 07:33:02,939
Jesus Christ.

5980
07:33:14,959 --> 07:33:15,439
What is it?

5981
07:33:18,319 --> 07:33:20,560
6, 5, 6, 7.

5982
07:33:23,400 --> 07:33:29,180
6, 5, I need a 3.

5983
07:33:30,220 --> 07:33:32,919
3, please.

5984
07:33:32,919 --> 07:33:33,240
Come on.

5985
07:33:37,069 --> 07:33:38,590
6, 7.

5986
07:33:40,810 --> 07:33:42,409
6, 7.

5987
07:33:55,150 --> 07:33:55,950
A 10 for ever?

5988
07:33:55,950 --> 07:33:56,669
A 10 for style?

5989
07:33:56,669 --> 07:35:04,790
Chop down five palm trees. Let's give it a go. One. I wish there was a weight. What?

5990
07:35:04,790 --> 07:35:39,779
Climb the snowy mountain? You got it. Let's go. Listen to that. Listen to that.

5991
07:35:39,779 --> 07:36:08,319
Let's get up there, come on. Come on, get up there. Break it. Give me the flag.

5992
07:36:08,319 --> 07:36:16,810
Get the flag in the mountain area. There's one more thing up here. What is it?

5993
07:36:16,810 --> 07:36:55,470
How many lilies do I have? What's this? Oh, there's a little place to go.

5994
07:36:55,470 --> 07:37:37,409
Oh my god. Smash it. I'm not gonna smash it. The pedal is giving me some resistance now though.

5995
07:37:37,409 --> 07:38:07,750
Did I fuck it up? I think it's okay. It didn't do anything. Does it know that I don't have a foot on it?

5996
07:38:07,750 --> 07:38:18,220
What? Apparently. Alright, as fast as I fucking can go downhill, go.

5997
07:38:18,220 --> 07:38:54,509
Dropping on two wheels. Turn signal. Oh, you're dead.

5998
07:38:54,509 --> 07:39:08,909
I'm almost there. This looks kind of fun, not gonna lie. Actually, it's kind of fun. Out of fuel.

5999
07:39:08,909 --> 07:39:33,270
Oh. There's now something called car. Introducing the car.

6000
07:39:33,270 --> 07:40:01,580
Hey Jeremy. Have you tried?

6001
07:40:01,580 --> 07:40:07,159
This thing is really nice looking though. He's skipping the lower. Yes, I am.

6002
07:40:07,159 --> 07:40:30,439
Take a test. Oh, it's like 2 a.m. Eastern. Jesus.

6003
07:40:30,439 --> 07:40:37,500
There's still like 24, 2,500 people still here. Thanks for staying up with me, guys.

6004
07:40:37,500 --> 07:40:55,290
We get it. We made it. I'm here Mr. Receiving. Tell me a little bullshit, please.

6005
07:40:55,290 --> 07:41:23,939
Now break it. I can't move. How do I like, how do I go back? Get this fucking key out of here.

6006
07:41:23,939 --> 07:41:34,599
First of all, I got the key. We're not going anywhere.

6007
07:41:34,599 --> 07:41:54,049
Change vehicle. The submarine and the plane. I didn't make those yet though, dude.

6008
07:41:54,049 --> 07:42:09,200
I don't have the submarine. It's like four more hours from now.

6009
07:42:09,200 --> 07:42:18,860
I can't, are they talking? Because I can't hear them.

6010
07:42:18,860 --> 07:42:43,259
DLC. All right. Bye. Oh, we don't have the submarine at all.

6011
07:42:43,259 --> 07:42:55,479
60 to 120 minutes. Four hours. I don't think I can make it.

6012
07:42:55,479 --> 07:43:02,709
Yeah. It's like, it's been eight hours. I need to get more food.

6013
07:43:02,709 --> 07:43:14,200
I knew he was a liar. Get some sleep. Yeah, I think it's time for bed.

6014
07:43:14,200 --> 07:43:23,819
I'm going to wind down. I will finish the labo. Probably never.

6015
07:43:23,819 --> 07:43:32,599
Oh, be careful. No wine on the table. Oh, that's good.

6016
07:43:32,599 --> 07:43:36,040
I'm going to put this on my shelf back here. Got it.

6017
07:43:36,040 --> 07:43:44,909
Don't, I'm not going to, this is, this is like actually nice.

6018
07:43:44,909 --> 07:43:48,909
This is a very nice looking piece of equipment. I'm not going to break it.

6019
07:43:48,909 --> 07:43:53,909
Plus you can use this as Mario Kart. I will school so many noobs.

6020
07:43:53,909 --> 07:44:07,759
I'm going to use this as Mario Kart 8. Anyways, that's it.

6021
07:44:07,759 --> 07:44:16,430
There was an absurd amount of support tonight. Thank you everybody.

6022
07:44:16,430 --> 07:44:21,970
Let's get this turned on. Let's move this out of the way.

6023
07:44:21,970 --> 07:44:28,619
Oh, move the pedal, move the car, move this shit out of the way.

6024
07:44:28,619 --> 07:44:33,520
You guys are un fucking believable.

6025
07:44:33,520 --> 07:44:36,889
When the credits roll, there's going to be hundreds of fucking names.

6026
07:44:36,889 --> 07:44:41,130
I'll never be able to keep up. I'm breaking things as I move.

6027
07:44:41,130 --> 07:44:50,939
Come on, man. Okay. Let's do the bits.

6028
07:44:50,939 --> 07:45:04,630
Let's go back before here. Back to, oh, why the, this is fucked up.

6029
07:45:04,630 --> 07:45:15,869
Well, my bit readings are screwed up. I need that website because this shit is fucked up.

6030
07:45:15,869 --> 07:45:22,029
No, never mind. I got it. I got it.

6031
07:45:22,029 --> 07:45:39,369
So let's go back here to quite a while ago.

6032
07:45:39,369 --> 07:45:46,060
This is seven hours ago now. Damn. That's a long fucking time ago.

6033
07:45:46,060 --> 07:45:54,360
Thank you too. By the way, if you take it off, I know it's late.

6034
07:45:54,360 --> 07:45:59,360
See you soon. I will see you guys on tomorrow, Sunday, Monday.

6035
07:45:59,360 --> 07:46:01,790
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

6036
07:46:01,790 --> 07:46:04,790
Tuesday, we will talk more about the green screen.

6037
07:46:04,790 --> 07:46:06,790
There's a lot to talk about.

6038
07:46:06,790 --> 07:46:14,240
I will give the poll on Tuesday because that's pretty much what a majority of the stream will be discussed on.

6039
07:46:14,240 --> 07:46:21,529
So let's get this labo shit out of here and let's go with an outro. There we go.

6040
07:46:21,529 --> 07:46:40,169
So, uh, seven hours ago, we had tons of gifted subs and we also had bits from, let me move this out of the way so I can get closer here.

6041
07:46:40,169 --> 07:46:48,880
Decozerski for the one dollar. Chat cast a dud. All of the money is fake. Thank you.

6042
07:46:48,880 --> 07:46:56,180
Pocket Pauling gave an absolute fucking shitload of money.

6043
07:46:56,180 --> 07:47:02,430
They gave so much fucking money tonight. I can't even comprehend.

6044
07:47:02,430 --> 07:47:12,720
Rentacat gave five dollars. They said sorry. I'm not sure why you're apologizing, but thank you, Rentacat.

6045
07:47:13,720 --> 07:47:23,099

6047
07:47:27,099 --> 07:47:29,849

6048
07:47:29,849 --> 07:47:39,060
Manboy, thanks for the one dollar earlier. You should stream labo more, huh? Sorry.

6049
07:47:39,060 --> 07:47:41,360
Thank you.

6050
07:47:41,360 --> 07:47:47,599

6051
07:47:47,599 --> 07:47:56,279
Peanut Chan, thanks for three dollars. I don't know why I bought these bits, but I'll add them to the pile.

6052
07:47:56,279 --> 07:47:59,540
You're fucking amazing. Thank you.

6053
07:47:59,540 --> 07:48:02,479
It means a lot.

6054
07:48:02,479 --> 07:48:07,790
Germo Meme Man gave one dollar. Shout out to SimpleFlips.

6055
07:48:07,790 --> 07:48:13,659
Okay. Shout out to that person. Thank you.

6056
07:48:13,659 --> 07:48:18,659
Awesome Alec, thanks for the one dollar and one cent. Put seven hundred dollars on red for me.

6057
07:48:18,659 --> 07:48:26,880

6058
07:48:26,880 --> 07:48:33,520
Abserviday, thank you Abserviday for the money.

6059
07:48:33,520 --> 07:48:40,799
If you don't let this pocket-palling person name your first child by now, I don't know what to think.

6060
07:48:40,799 --> 07:48:43,740
I hope you name it Greg.

6061
07:48:43,740 --> 07:48:48,279
Spegar, thank you Spegar for the two bucks.

6062
07:48:48,279 --> 07:48:54,069
Thank you. Thank you.

6063
07:48:54,069 --> 07:48:57,459
Thank you Spegar for the two bucks.

6064
07:48:57,459 --> 07:49:01,720
Germo cries on stream. Let me say, I didn't cry.

6065
07:49:01,720 --> 07:49:06,950
And I'm so glad we finally get to see it on stream.

6066
07:49:06,950 --> 07:49:09,950
You know what I mean? Fucking Minecraft is so...

6067
07:49:09,950 --> 07:49:11,950
It's a revolutionary game.

6068
07:49:11,950 --> 07:49:13,950
Ayayay.

6069
07:49:13,950 --> 07:49:18,020
Minecraft, what a revolutionary video game.

6070
07:49:18,020 --> 07:49:20,020
Fucking Minecraft.

6071
07:49:20,020 --> 07:49:26,360
Oh my...

6072
07:49:26,360 --> 07:49:34,930
Oh god.

6073
07:49:34,930 --> 07:49:38,180
Thank you.

6074
07:49:38,180 --> 07:49:40,479
Thank you.

6075
07:49:41,479 --> 07:49:45,630
Thank you too.

6076
07:49:45,630 --> 07:49:48,630
Captain Magic for the five dollars. Thanks Captain Magic.

6077
07:49:48,630 --> 07:49:52,759
Thanks honestly for all the laughs over the years. Here's to many more.

6078
07:49:52,759 --> 07:49:55,770
Hope so. Thanks a lot man.

6079
07:49:55,770 --> 07:49:59,009
Mad 47, thanks for the one dollar Mad.

6080
07:49:59,009 --> 07:50:04,009
Y'all are so kind and accepting to everything. I love it so much. Keep going man. Cheers.

6081
07:50:04,009 --> 07:50:09,299
I think this is a pretty great community.

6082
07:50:09,299 --> 07:50:15,419
I think we're pretty open and accepting to anyone.

6083
07:50:15,419 --> 07:50:19,349
Anyone. So. At least I think that way.

6084
07:50:19,349 --> 07:50:23,650
We can be a little fucking goofy. We can talk a little shit. But you know.

6085
07:50:23,650 --> 07:50:30,590
It's only good fun. But thank you Mad 47.

6086
07:50:30,590 --> 07:50:34,590
Thank you to Silker. SilkerGN for the one dollar.

6087
07:50:34,590 --> 07:50:40,360
Hey Germo95, would you join my Minecraft server on the Switch?

6088
07:50:40,360 --> 07:50:43,630
I made the game by the way.

6089
07:50:43,630 --> 07:50:49,040
I don't play Minecraft. It's a revolutionary game but I don't play it. Thank you.

6090
07:50:49,040 --> 07:50:54,819
PugNinja thanks for the one dollar. Love you Germo. Keep up the good.

6091
07:50:54,819 --> 07:50:58,680
I said goofs. I said goofs.

6092
07:50:58,680 --> 07:51:03,509
Keep up the goofs. I will try.

6093
07:51:03,509 --> 07:51:08,080
Thank you PugNinja for the one dollar.

6094
07:51:08,080 --> 07:51:14,080
David Cage official Twitch. Got a feeling that's not the real official David Cage on Twitch.

6095
07:51:14,080 --> 07:51:18,319
But thank you David Cage for the one dollar and fifteen cents regardless.

6096
07:51:18,319 --> 07:51:23,319
Hey Germo missed you while you were gone. Ever plan on playing Fallout 76 or maybe RimWorld?

6097
07:51:23,319 --> 07:51:26,840
Any who have a nice night.

6098
07:51:26,840 --> 07:51:33,720
Fallout 76 I might play. Just to fuck around for a little while.

6099
07:51:33,720 --> 07:51:43,189
I can't imagine I'll put that much time into Fallout 76 but maybe. We'll see.

6100
07:51:43,189 --> 07:51:48,560
And RimWorld maybe I'll ask Italics for some info. On some fun things to do.

6101
07:51:48,560 --> 07:51:54,419
Fallout 76 is trash. Yeah but it's alright.

6102
07:51:54,419 --> 07:52:07,950
Rick and Morty already played it.

6103
07:52:07,950 --> 07:52:09,950
Thank you Carrot7 for the one dollar.

6104
07:52:09,950 --> 07:52:17,939
I'm a university student so I don't have much time to spare but there's not a chance that I'm going to miss out on the money train.

6105
07:52:17,939 --> 07:52:22,119
Keep being you Germo. You're an inspiration.

6106
07:52:22,119 --> 07:52:26,360
Thank you all as well for inspiring me.

6107
07:52:26,360 --> 07:52:29,819
Thank you for the inspiration as well.

6108
07:52:29,819 --> 07:52:32,439
Much love to you. Thank you for the one dollar.

6109
07:52:32,439 --> 07:52:34,439
Thank you Jake Sunshine for the one dollar.

6110
07:52:34,439 --> 07:52:40,439
Germo is one of the only tubers I've been able to watch for years that hasn't said something racist.

6111
07:52:40,439 --> 07:52:46,740
Why would I do that? What the fuck would I do that for?

6112
07:52:46,740 --> 07:52:53,869
Thank you Jake Sunshine. Thanks for the one dollar.

6113
07:52:53,869 --> 07:53:00,360
Thank you Ixion Games for the dollar 80 turning 25. I need to hear that.

6114
07:53:00,360 --> 07:53:10,150
Talking about being 33. It's an age. You get older.

6115
07:53:10,150 --> 07:53:15,630
You'll figure it out. But thank you Ixion Games for the two dollars nearly.

6116
07:53:15,630 --> 07:53:19,630
Cal Darby thanks for the one dollar. I tried stretching and accidentally broke my mum's neck.

6117
07:53:19,630 --> 07:53:22,630
We've read that one already but that got me already.

6118
07:53:22,630 --> 07:53:28,340
Thank you Zan Man for the one dollar.

6119
07:53:28,340 --> 07:53:34,340
My 20th birthday is on the 12th and it would mean the world to me if you wished me a happy birthday.

6120
07:53:34,340 --> 07:53:38,580
I've been watching your stuff for years and I wish I could afford to give you more.

6121
07:53:38,580 --> 07:53:46,720
Happy birthday Zan Man. 1998. Have a great one on the 12th.

6122
07:53:46,720 --> 07:53:53,060
All of us here wish you the best. Have a great one. Thank you.

6123
07:53:53,060 --> 07:54:00,130
MandragoraRoot thanks for the one dollar.

6124
07:54:00,130 --> 07:54:05,680
It's really cool that you can be the single most funny person on the internet but be super real.

6125
07:54:05,680 --> 07:54:10,680
Thanks for being the one, the only, German 985.

6126
07:54:10,680 --> 07:54:20,209
I only know how to be one person. I don't know how to be anybody else. Thank you.

6127
07:54:20,209 --> 07:54:24,159
Funniest person ever confirmed by the way.

6128
07:54:24,159 --> 07:54:31,840
I'm not sure that that's the case but I'm glad you have fun.

6129
07:54:31,840 --> 07:54:37,159
Darkstar, 700,000 games thanks for the one dollar Darkstar.

6130
07:54:37,159 --> 07:54:43,979
It's funny you should mention getting a haircut. I've recently visited my mother and she and I were going back and forth.

6131
07:54:43,979 --> 07:54:48,979
She said my hair was too long and I was saying I like the length my hair is at.

6132
07:54:48,979 --> 07:54:51,159
Dot dot dot dot.

6133
07:54:51,159 --> 07:54:54,159
And then my mother looked at something off to the distance behind me.

6134
07:54:54,159 --> 07:55:00,159
Remember I'm facing her and she's looking towards me and she opens her mouth slowly and says oh my god.

6135
07:55:00,159 --> 07:55:04,779
I look behind me and there's this 25 foot spider on the wall.

6136
07:55:04,779 --> 07:55:11,860
Thank you Cal Darby for the one dollar. Fail RP you're ruining my immersion.

6137
07:55:11,860 --> 07:55:16,250
Sorry about that dude. Sorry about that fucking bro.

6138
07:55:16,250 --> 07:55:20,000
Ritter Rittington thanks for the one dollar.

6139
07:55:20,000 --> 07:55:25,880
While I'm procrastinating on school work that's weeks due by watching your stream.

6140
07:55:25,880 --> 07:55:31,060
I just wanted to say that you're a fantastically funny guy and deserve all the damn money coming your way.

6141
07:55:31,060 --> 07:55:36,779
Have a dollar you scruffy hobo. Thank you.

6142
07:55:36,779 --> 07:55:40,349
Thank you Ritter.

6143
07:55:40,349 --> 07:55:42,650
That means a lot.

6144
07:55:42,650 --> 07:55:48,130
Thank you Free iPod for the ten dollars. We touched upon it already but thank you.

6145
07:55:48,130 --> 07:55:51,130
Thank you Voyeuristic Vol for the five dollars.

6146
07:55:51,130 --> 07:55:58,020
Some may call me a no life nerd who's never sexually done stuff.

6147
07:55:58,020 --> 07:56:01,020
Jim Davis Garfield before in his entire life.

6148
07:56:01,020 --> 07:56:06,389
What? But as long as I can watch your streams I feel like I can tolerate this state of affairs all the best.

6149
07:56:06,389 --> 07:56:12,959
What are you talking about? What happened?

6150
07:56:12,959 --> 07:56:14,959
Thank you.

6151
07:56:14,959 --> 07:56:17,959
Thank you Paradox Potato for the two dollars.

6152
07:56:17,959 --> 07:56:23,479
If you think you can drive well you can teach Forsen how to drive.

6153
07:56:23,479 --> 07:56:28,130
I don't really give lessons but good luck to you Forsen.

6154
07:56:28,130 --> 07:56:33,959
Hopefully you can figure it out too. It's tough.

6155
07:56:33,959 --> 07:56:35,959
Digit Guy thanks for the two bucks.

6156
07:56:35,959 --> 07:56:37,959

Werewed thanks for the one dollar Werewed.

6158
07:56:43,439 --> 07:56:46,930
About a half a year ago I started...

6159
07:56:46,930 --> 07:56:52,490
About a half a year ago I started writing Lego Island in chat every stream.

6160
07:56:52,490 --> 07:56:56,490
I watched and brainwashed the community to make you play this masterpiece of a game.

6161
07:56:56,490 --> 07:56:59,919
In the end it didn't work out but thanks for trying.

6162
07:56:59,919 --> 07:57:10,180
The journey was fun but I will now go into Lego Island retirement.

6163
07:57:10,180 --> 07:57:13,419
Thank you Werewed Forty for the two dollars total here.

6164
07:57:13,419 --> 07:57:15,419
What about Lego Island Two?

6165
07:57:15,419 --> 07:57:21,400
I'm going to get a whole of a Gameboy Advance maybe.

6166
07:57:21,400 --> 07:57:24,400
Tom thank you Tom Sup for the one dollar.

6167
07:57:24,400 --> 07:57:27,080
This stream is making my day. Thank you streamer. Thank you.

And Dachshund thanks for one dollar and Dachshund.

6171
07:57:38,360 --> 07:57:41,360
I'm sorry I said you took three hours when it was actually two.

6172
07:57:41,360 --> 07:57:44,360
I was watching another stream before so I forgot.

6173
07:57:44,360 --> 07:57:48,270
Please take my money as an apology.

6174
07:57:48,270 --> 07:57:50,509
Apology accepted. Apology accepted.

6175
07:57:50,509 --> 07:57:54,779

Enraged Grandpa thanks for the five dollars Enraged Grandpa.

6177
07:57:57,779 --> 07:58:00,209
Don't spend it all in one place honey.

6178
07:58:00,209 --> 07:58:01,770
I won't.

6179
07:58:01,770 --> 07:58:07,139
I'll spend two dollars on a coffee, two dollars on a sandwich and one dollar on the casino.

6180
07:58:07,139 --> 07:58:09,139
On the one cent slots.

6181
07:58:09,139 --> 07:58:11,700
Thank you so much man.

6182
07:58:11,700 --> 07:58:17,959
Thank you Slavic God Memes for the ten bucks.

6183
07:58:17,959 --> 07:58:22,040
My mother just walked in who knew nothing about Twitch.

6184
07:58:22,040 --> 07:58:28,040
And I had to explain to her that I was watching a 33 year old guy playing with a children's toy while drinking wine.

6185
07:58:28,040 --> 07:58:40,919
Thank you for the ten bucks and hopefully you talked to her about online media.

6186
07:58:40,919 --> 07:58:43,409
Just say online media.

6187
07:58:43,409 --> 07:58:46,159
What are you watching in there Dave?

6188
07:58:46,159 --> 07:58:49,470
I'm watching an online media guy.

6189
07:58:49,470 --> 07:58:51,709
Oh okay I get it.

6190
07:58:51,709 --> 07:58:55,299
Thank you.

6191
07:58:55,299 --> 07:58:58,299
Thank you Sad Vega for the one dollar.

6192
07:58:58,299 --> 07:59:01,040
They just say Vohio.

6193
07:59:01,040 --> 07:59:02,040
Thank you so much.

6194
07:59:02,040 --> 07:59:04,979
Clueless Sniper thanks for the one dollar.

6195
07:59:04,979 --> 07:59:07,979
Hey Jerma I'm not an oil tycoon like some of the people donating tonight.

6196
07:59:07,979 --> 07:59:14,459
I feel the need to kick some bits towards the money stream.

6197
07:59:14,459 --> 07:59:19,959
You're an amazing entertaining person and you deserve every cent you get.

6198
07:59:19,959 --> 07:59:22,740
Much love.

6199
07:59:22,740 --> 07:59:24,880
That means a lot.

6200
07:59:24,880 --> 07:59:30,459
One dollar or a hundred means a lot that you would even think about it in the first place.

6201
07:59:30,459 --> 07:59:31,459
So thank you so much.

6202
07:59:31,459 --> 07:59:34,790
Thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar.

6203
07:59:34,790 --> 07:59:44,720
You say everyone called you an idiot last stream but here is what actually happened.

6204
07:59:44,720 --> 07:59:48,720
You're all idiots.

6205
07:59:48,720 --> 07:59:51,599
No I'm not saying that.

6206
07:59:51,599 --> 07:59:58,080
I'm saying what somebody said.

6207
07:59:58,080 --> 08:00:00,080
I was saying what somebody said.

6208
08:00:00,080 --> 08:00:02,080
I was quoting what somebody else said.

6209
08:00:02,080 --> 08:00:03,080
I was quoting what somebody else said.

6210
08:00:03,080 --> 08:00:04,709
See?

6211
08:00:04,709 --> 08:00:05,709
Gentlemen.

6212
08:00:05,709 --> 08:00:07,950
Okay.

6213
08:00:07,950 --> 08:00:12,490
I'm glad you left the whole clip.

6214
08:00:12,490 --> 08:00:20,669
But thank you.

6215
08:00:20,669 --> 08:00:21,669
Thank you Dr. Clay.

6216
08:00:21,669 --> 08:00:24,479
Rent a cat thanks for the one dollar.

6217
08:00:24,479 --> 08:00:25,479
Sorry again.

6218
08:00:25,479 --> 08:00:26,479
Don't be sorry.

6219
08:00:26,479 --> 08:00:31,880
Minkcar2001 thanks for the ten dollars.

6220
08:00:31,880 --> 08:00:36,509
Hey Jerma I'm also drunk on wine.

6221
08:00:36,509 --> 08:00:38,509
Just want to say thank you for all the good times.

6222
08:00:38,509 --> 08:00:40,509
I hope these bits find you well.

6223
08:00:40,509 --> 08:00:44,090
I will put them to good use.

6224
08:00:44,090 --> 08:00:45,400
I will try.

6225
08:00:45,400 --> 08:00:48,400
Thank you so much for the ten dollars and for being here and for watching.

6226
08:00:48,400 --> 08:00:49,700
Thank you.

6227
08:00:49,700 --> 08:00:51,700
Honeychain thanks for the one dollar.

6228
08:00:51,700 --> 08:00:53,700
I drank an entire bottle of wine and puked all over my friend's porch.

6229
08:00:53,700 --> 08:00:55,700
Then he powerbombed me through the sink.

6230
08:00:55,700 --> 08:00:59,700
We already came to the conclusion that WTF mate.

6231
08:00:59,700 --> 08:01:00,700
You know what I mean?

6232
08:01:00,700 --> 08:01:02,900
What the heck was that?

6233
08:01:02,900 --> 08:01:06,720
Thank you Bet3 for your two bucks here.

6234
08:01:06,720 --> 08:01:08,720
Give Otto my regards.

6235
08:01:08,720 --> 08:01:10,279
I will.

6236
08:01:10,279 --> 08:01:11,279
Bet3 again gave three dollars.

6237
08:01:11,279 --> 08:01:13,639
FrankerZ FrankerZ.

6238
08:01:13,639 --> 08:01:14,639
So five dollars total.

6239
08:01:14,639 --> 08:01:18,040
Yes I've got a great dog.

6240
08:01:18,040 --> 08:01:22,040
Peter thank you P7R for the five dollars.

6241
08:01:22,040 --> 08:01:26,500
FrankerZ I'm having a good time.

6242
08:01:26,500 --> 08:01:28,500
I'm glad you had a great time and thanks for the five bucks.

6243
08:01:28,500 --> 08:01:32,319
Have a great one.

6244
08:01:32,319 --> 08:01:33,319
End Pudding thanks for the one dollar.

6245
08:01:33,319 --> 08:01:36,330
These bits are for Otto.

6246
08:01:36,330 --> 08:01:37,330
I'll give him a nice bone.

6247
08:01:37,330 --> 08:01:38,330
Thank you.

6248
08:01:38,330 --> 08:01:41,529
Chubby Funster thanks for the one dollar.

6249
08:01:41,529 --> 08:01:42,529
Coming in with one buck here.

6250
08:01:42,529 --> 08:01:45,529
Hey Jermbo thanks for always being so entertaining and so lovely.

6251
08:01:45,529 --> 08:01:48,159
You truly are an amazing person.

6252
08:01:48,159 --> 08:01:49,159
Raise love.

6253
08:01:49,159 --> 08:01:51,159
Would you mind flexing on Cam?

6254
08:01:51,159 --> 08:01:53,720
We need to see those muscles man.

6255
08:01:53,720 --> 08:01:55,720
No worries though if you don't want to.

6256
08:01:55,720 --> 08:02:04,250
Thank you.

6257
08:02:04,250 --> 08:02:07,639
It's time for Slime.

6258
08:02:07,639 --> 08:02:10,139
Thanks for the two bucks time for Slime.

6259
08:02:10,139 --> 08:02:14,139
I too was inspired to crack some wine during this stream and I'm already a mess.

6260
08:02:14,139 --> 08:02:17,139
I have no idea how you're still as composed as you are.

6261
08:02:17,139 --> 08:02:21,299
Bravo.

6262
08:02:21,299 --> 08:02:24,950
I thought the red chair was your ass.

6263
08:02:24,950 --> 08:02:26,950
No it's...

6264
08:02:26,950 --> 08:02:28,950
Thank you time for Slime.

6265
08:02:28,950 --> 08:02:30,509
Appreciate it.

6266
08:02:30,509 --> 08:02:31,880
Hope you had fun.

6267
08:02:31,880 --> 08:02:36,759
Thank you DadHunters for the twenty dollars.

6268
08:02:36,759 --> 08:02:41,259
And they say hydrate.

6269
08:02:41,259 --> 08:02:49,919
Alright.

6270
08:02:49,919 --> 08:02:51,549
I just did it.

6271
08:02:51,549 --> 08:02:54,490
Thank you DadHunters for the twenty bucks.

6272
08:02:54,490 --> 08:02:56,490
Twenty dollars from DadHunters.

6273
08:02:56,490 --> 08:02:58,310
Thank you.

6274
08:02:58,310 --> 08:03:01,060
Cosmic Moses thanks for the one dollar.

6275
08:03:01,060 --> 08:03:03,360
Jermbo the smell does in fact exist.

6276
08:03:03,360 --> 08:03:06,360
My dog smells like Fritos in old books.

6277
08:03:06,360 --> 08:03:10,360
But I wouldn't consider it a savory smell.

6278
08:03:10,360 --> 08:03:17,619
Come on buddy we're taking you to rehab.

6279
08:03:17,619 --> 08:03:19,619
You guys know it's a savory...

6280
08:03:19,619 --> 08:03:20,919
Whatever.

6281
08:03:20,919 --> 08:03:22,919
David Cage thanks for the one dollar.

6282
08:03:22,919 --> 08:03:26,759
Why didn't you tell us Otto was ten?

6283
08:03:26,759 --> 08:03:29,319
Jermbo he's going to die.

6284
08:03:29,319 --> 08:03:30,319
Thanks.

6285
08:03:30,319 --> 08:03:32,319
Make me love a dog who would die.

6286
08:03:32,319 --> 08:03:33,319
What the fuck are you talking about?

6287
08:03:33,319 --> 08:03:35,319
Otto was like seven.

6288
08:03:35,319 --> 08:03:36,319
What?

6289
08:03:36,319 --> 08:03:39,590
Otto was seven years old.

6290
08:03:39,590 --> 08:03:40,590
He's not ten.

6291
08:03:40,590 --> 08:03:41,590
Where did you get that info from?

6292
08:03:41,590 --> 08:03:42,590
I didn't say that.

6293
08:03:42,590 --> 08:03:45,080
Come on man.

6294
08:03:45,080 --> 08:03:48,439
Come on.

6295
08:03:48,439 --> 08:03:56,290
That's fake.

6296
08:03:56,290 --> 08:03:58,290
Thank you Darkstar again for the one dollar.

6297
08:03:58,290 --> 08:03:59,290
Jermbo versus Critical.

6298
08:03:59,290 --> 08:04:01,290
Jermbo versus...

6299
08:04:01,290 --> 08:04:05,290
Everyone wants to see this happen.

6300
08:04:05,290 --> 08:04:09,349
He's a good dude.

6301
08:04:09,349 --> 08:04:11,680
Joel's a great guy.

6302
08:04:11,680 --> 08:04:12,680
Critical's a great guy.

6303
08:04:12,680 --> 08:04:16,069
Give them nothing but the best.

6304
08:04:16,069 --> 08:04:17,069
Thank you.

6305
08:04:17,069 --> 08:04:20,310
Darkstar thank you for that one dollar.

6306
08:04:20,310 --> 08:04:22,310
E-Dragon thanks for the 250.

6307
08:04:22,310 --> 08:04:26,150
I really think you should start seeing a therapist.

6308
08:04:26,150 --> 08:04:30,150
These drunk fits of rage are really concerning.

6309
08:04:30,150 --> 08:04:36,459
And I don't think Otto should have to put up with them.

6310
08:04:36,459 --> 08:04:37,459
Otto's downstairs with Kim.

6311
08:04:37,459 --> 08:04:41,680
What are you talking about?

6312
08:04:41,680 --> 08:04:44,869
Thank you so much though.

6313
08:04:44,869 --> 08:04:46,869
Darkstar again for the one dollar.

6314
08:04:46,869 --> 08:04:51,110
Whoa check out these crazy streamer house antics and pranks.

6315
08:04:51,110 --> 08:04:53,110
I didn't fucking prank anybody.

6316
08:04:53,110 --> 08:04:55,479
I walked in his room.

6317
08:04:55,479 --> 08:04:56,479
Please.

6318
08:04:56,479 --> 08:04:57,479
Hey.

6319
08:04:57,479 --> 08:04:58,479
Alright.

6320
08:04:58,479 --> 08:05:00,479
Thank you Apepperoni for the one dollar.

6321
08:05:00,479 --> 08:05:06,159
This stream was a mess and I don't regret at all supporting it.

6322
08:05:06,159 --> 08:05:09,709
Jermamoon.

6323
08:05:09,709 --> 08:05:10,709
I had a lot of fun.

6324
08:05:10,709 --> 08:05:13,139
This was a ton of fun.

6325
08:05:13,139 --> 08:05:15,139
What a great fun time I had.

6326
08:05:15,139 --> 08:05:16,139
I hope you guys had fun too.

6327
08:05:16,139 --> 08:05:19,139
Thank you Mandragoroot for the one dollar.

6328
08:05:19,139 --> 08:05:21,139
Please make a Jupiter shirt.

6329
08:05:21,139 --> 08:05:25,139
Jupiter will be on the shirt that is being sold around Christmastime this year.

6330
08:05:25,139 --> 08:05:28,200
Along with the Glooman shirt.

6331
08:05:28,200 --> 08:05:29,200
Which will make a return.

6332
08:05:29,200 --> 08:05:32,270
Look for that somewhere in December.

6333
08:05:32,270 --> 08:05:38,069
Thank you Bet3 again for the ten dollars.

6334
08:05:38,069 --> 08:05:43,250
I'm thinking about getting some pet rats.

6335
08:05:43,250 --> 08:05:45,250
What are some good old.

6336
08:05:45,250 --> 08:05:47,430
What are some good names for two rats?

6337
08:05:47,430 --> 08:05:51,560
Wrinkle and Dinkle.

6338
08:05:51,560 --> 08:05:52,560
There you go.

6339
08:05:52,560 --> 08:05:53,560
Wrinkle and Dinkle.

6340
08:05:53,560 --> 08:05:56,599
Those are the two rat names.

6341
08:05:56,599 --> 08:05:58,599
Thank you so much for the ten bucks.

6342
08:05:58,599 --> 08:06:01,669
It's time for slime.

6343
08:06:01,669 --> 08:06:02,669
Thanks for one dollar.

6344
08:06:02,669 --> 08:06:03,669
I take it back.

6345
08:06:03,669 --> 08:06:05,669
You might be on my level now.

6346
08:06:05,669 --> 08:06:07,799
Hey asshole.

6347
08:06:07,799 --> 08:06:08,799
What's with the planets?

6348
08:06:08,799 --> 08:06:09,799
What?

6349
08:06:09,799 --> 08:06:10,799
What?

6350
08:06:13,639 --> 08:06:14,639
Shane2567.

6351
08:06:14,639 --> 08:06:15,639
Hey asshole.

6352
08:06:15,639 --> 08:06:31,709
What's with the planets?

6353
08:06:31,709 --> 08:06:33,139
I don't know.

6354
08:06:33,139 --> 08:06:34,139
Asshole.

6355
08:06:34,139 --> 08:06:41,630
Why am I an asshole?

6356
08:06:41,630 --> 08:06:42,630
Sy and TF2.

6357
08:06:42,630 --> 08:06:43,630
Thanks for the one dollar.

6358
08:06:43,630 --> 08:06:47,569
Here are some bits.

6359
08:06:47,569 --> 08:06:49,569
I know it's all you want.

6360
08:06:49,569 --> 08:06:50,569
Jesus.

6361
08:06:50,569 --> 08:06:51,569
I'm sorry.

6362
08:06:51,569 --> 08:06:52,569
Please no.

6363
08:06:52,569 --> 08:06:55,799
Bet.

6364
08:06:55,799 --> 08:07:00,169
Get out of here.

6365
08:07:00,169 --> 08:07:01,169
No I'm just kidding.

6366
08:07:01,169 --> 08:07:05,680
Welcome dude.

6367
08:07:05,680 --> 08:07:06,680
Thank you so much.

6368
08:07:06,680 --> 08:07:09,680
Son of Jenova for the one dollar.

6369
08:07:09,680 --> 08:07:11,680
This is a nice frame of your yes.

6370
08:07:11,680 --> 08:07:23,419
This looks like an FMV fucking video game screen grab from like 1996.

6371
08:07:23,419 --> 08:07:28,650
Thank you son of Jenova.

6372
08:07:28,650 --> 08:07:30,650
Cuckoo G1.

6373
08:07:30,650 --> 08:07:31,650
Thanks for the one buck.

6374
08:07:31,650 --> 08:07:33,650
No that's ten.

6375
08:07:33,650 --> 08:07:37,520
That is ten dollars from Cuckoo.

6376
08:07:37,520 --> 08:07:39,520
They just say rip cheer one thousand.

6377
08:07:39,520 --> 08:07:42,909
Thank you so much for ten bucks.

6378
08:07:42,909 --> 08:07:45,909
Thank you the mad god 47 for the five dollars.

6379
08:07:45,909 --> 08:07:51,790
Hey German any chance for another directors commentary stream over your old videos I mean.

6380
08:07:51,790 --> 08:07:52,790
Rumble live would be cool.

6381
08:07:52,790 --> 08:07:53,790
Rat two.

6382
08:07:53,790 --> 08:07:54,790
Thanks.

6383
08:07:54,790 --> 08:07:57,630
Either way.

6384
08:07:57,630 --> 08:07:58,630
Eat some bread.

6385
08:07:58,630 --> 08:08:02,240
Well we'll be doing that in a few weeks after the green screen stream.

6386
08:08:02,240 --> 08:08:04,240
So it should be fun.

6387
08:08:04,240 --> 08:08:07,729
Thank you mad god for the five dollars.

6388
08:08:07,729 --> 08:08:09,729
Sieg's corner for the one dollar.

6389
08:08:09,729 --> 08:08:10,729
No message.

6390
08:08:10,729 --> 08:08:13,439
Thank you.

6391
08:08:13,439 --> 08:08:15,959

08:08:23,659 --> 08:08:28,090
Roy on Nick Roy Roy on Oink.

6396
08:08:28,090 --> 08:08:29,720
That is not your name.

6397
08:08:29,720 --> 08:08:35,599
Rovo Rovo on Oink.

6398
08:08:35,599 --> 08:08:36,599
Robin Oink.

6399
08:08:36,599 --> 08:08:39,610
Not Roy on Oink.

6400
08:08:39,610 --> 08:08:41,490
Revan Oink.

6401
08:08:41,490 --> 08:08:43,729
Thank you for the ten dollars.

6402
08:08:43,729 --> 08:08:48,119
Hey German I've been watching your stream and YouTube for a while.

6403
08:08:48,119 --> 08:08:50,119
Figured I might as well join in on the meme.

6404
08:08:50,119 --> 08:08:54,619
Wishing them the best and always stayed true to being a down to earth dude.

6405
08:08:54,619 --> 08:08:57,590
Thank you.

6406
08:08:57,590 --> 08:09:01,799
Revan Oink for your ten dollars.

6407
08:09:01,799 --> 08:09:02,970
Appreciate it.

6408
08:09:02,970 --> 08:09:03,970
Thank you so much.

6409
08:09:03,970 --> 08:09:07,299
And I'm just me.

6410
08:09:07,299 --> 08:09:08,299
Can't be anybody else.

6411
08:09:08,299 --> 08:09:12,139
Thank you shirt for the four dollars.

6412
08:09:12,139 --> 08:09:14,139
Shirt one one three four bucks.

6413
08:09:14,139 --> 08:09:18,150
Honestly German has made my life ten times better and has gotten me through tough times.

6414
08:09:18,150 --> 08:09:20,389
He deserves the best.

6415
08:09:20,389 --> 08:09:23,650
I think you deserve the best as well.

6416
08:09:23,650 --> 08:09:24,650
Take care of yourself.

6417
08:09:24,650 --> 08:09:25,650
Much love to you.

6418
08:09:25,650 --> 08:09:27,400
Thank you so much for four dollars.

6419
08:09:27,400 --> 08:09:28,400
Maisy kit.

6420
08:09:28,400 --> 08:09:29,400
Thanks for one dollar.

6421
08:09:29,400 --> 08:09:36,279
I just think it's cool that people can get paid to do what they love like struggling with cardboard.

6422
08:09:36,279 --> 08:09:37,459
Thanks dude.

6423
08:09:37,459 --> 08:09:39,459
Thank you Bruinstar for the one dollar.

6424
08:09:39,459 --> 08:09:42,209
Loved your stuff from the beginning.

6425
08:09:42,209 --> 08:09:45,220
Glad to see you're finally getting recognition.

6426
08:09:47,799 --> 08:09:52,000
And you can thank all the people that decided to watch.

6427
08:09:52,000 --> 08:09:55,080
You know recognition means people are here.

6428
08:09:55,080 --> 08:09:58,900
Thank them because they're here.

6429
08:09:58,900 --> 08:10:00,590
So thank you.

6430
08:10:00,590 --> 08:10:01,759
All of you.

6431
08:10:01,759 --> 08:10:04,580
Tiny cactus thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents.

6432
08:10:04,580 --> 08:10:07,580
Yeah the twenty five dollars I spent took me less than two hours to earn.

6433
08:10:07,580 --> 08:10:09,580
I mean it's not too bad right.

6434
08:10:09,580 --> 08:10:12,159
Thank you tiny cactus.

6435
08:10:12,159 --> 08:10:16,520
Take a look at the bit leaderboards.

6436
08:10:16,520 --> 08:10:19,009
It's fucking crazy.

6437
08:10:19,009 --> 08:10:24,709
That truly is insane.

6438
08:10:24,709 --> 08:10:27,279
Look at that.

6439
08:10:27,279 --> 08:10:28,279
A thousand three hundred two hundred.

6440
08:10:28,279 --> 08:10:30,279
A hundred hundred hundred hundred.

6441
08:10:30,279 --> 08:10:33,919
Un-fucking-believable.

6442
08:10:33,919 --> 08:10:38,810
Thank you so much everybody.

6443
08:10:38,810 --> 08:10:41,689
He almost cried.

6444
08:10:41,689 --> 08:10:44,569
He got me close.

6445
08:10:44,569 --> 08:10:46,569
Thank you Novi for the two dollars and ten cents.

6446
08:10:46,569 --> 08:10:47,569
Last of my bits you earned them.

6447
08:10:47,569 --> 08:10:50,090
Thank you.

6448
08:10:50,090 --> 08:10:51,090
Thanks for even considering.

6449
08:10:51,090 --> 08:10:53,040
Thank you so much Novi.

6450
08:10:53,040 --> 08:10:58,000
Matters of Darkness gave a bunch of community subs.

6451
08:10:58,000 --> 08:11:03,979
What is this?

6452
08:11:03,979 --> 08:11:04,979
Hello everybody.

6453
08:11:04,979 --> 08:11:05,979
Let me introduce myself.

6454
08:11:05,979 --> 08:11:06,979
My name is Jerma.

6455
08:11:06,979 --> 08:11:08,979
I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.

6456
08:11:08,979 --> 08:11:10,979
Some of you people might already know me from playing in servers.

6457
08:11:10,979 --> 08:11:13,159
But some of you probably don't.

6458
08:11:13,159 --> 08:11:14,159
This is my introduction to you guys.

6459
08:11:14,159 --> 08:11:16,159
I'm going to just do Team Fortress commentaries.

6460
08:11:16,159 --> 08:11:17,159
But I'm going to do other stuff.

6461
08:11:17,159 --> 08:11:19,159
Most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff.

6462
08:11:19,159 --> 08:11:20,400
Because I love the game.

6463
08:11:20,400 --> 08:11:22,400
And it's my absolute favorite game in the world right now.

6464
08:11:22,400 --> 08:11:23,400
It has been...

6465
08:11:23,400 --> 08:11:26,220
What is that?

6466
08:11:26,220 --> 08:11:27,220
That's my first video?

6467
08:11:27,220 --> 08:11:30,380
What does that part mean?

6468
08:11:30,380 --> 08:11:32,380
You might know me from servers.

6469
08:11:32,380 --> 08:11:36,220
Like you might know me from a server.

6470
08:11:36,220 --> 08:11:38,970
Who the fuck was that?

6471
08:11:38,970 --> 08:11:39,970
Who the hell was I talking to?

6472
08:11:39,970 --> 08:11:57,340
That's not my video.

6473
08:11:57,340 --> 08:12:06,599
I didn't make the...

6474
08:12:06,599 --> 08:12:11,279
Did I actually say that in this video?

6475
08:12:11,279 --> 08:12:12,279
I didn't do this.

6476
08:12:12,279 --> 08:12:13,279
This is not me.

6477
08:12:13,279 --> 08:12:14,279
Get it off.

6478
08:12:19,009 --> 08:12:27,700
Hello everybody.

6479
08:12:27,700 --> 08:12:29,639
Introduce myself.

6480
08:12:29,639 --> 08:12:30,639
Right here.

6481
08:12:30,639 --> 08:12:31,639
My name is Jerma.

6482
08:12:31,639 --> 08:12:34,459
I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.

6483
08:12:34,459 --> 08:12:37,459
Some people might already know me from playing in servers.

6484
08:12:37,459 --> 08:12:38,459
What?

6485
08:12:38,459 --> 08:12:39,459
Some of you probably don't.

6486
08:12:39,459 --> 08:12:40,459
And this is my introduction to you guys.

6487
08:12:40,459 --> 08:12:42,459
What are you talking about?

6488
08:12:42,459 --> 08:12:44,459
I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.

6489
08:12:44,459 --> 08:12:45,459
I'm going to do other stuff.

6490
08:12:47,459 --> 08:12:48,459
Hello everybody.

6491
08:12:48,459 --> 08:12:50,459
Who would know me from servers?

6492
08:12:50,459 --> 08:12:53,459
My name is Jerma.

6493
08:12:53,459 --> 08:12:55,889
I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.

6494
08:12:55,889 --> 08:12:58,889
Some people might already know me from playing in servers.

6495
08:12:58,889 --> 08:13:00,889
Some of you probably don't.

6496
08:13:00,889 --> 08:13:02,889
And this is my introduction to you guys.

6497
08:13:02,889 --> 08:13:05,889
I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.

6498
08:13:05,889 --> 08:13:06,889
I'm going to do other stuff.

6499
08:13:06,889 --> 08:13:09,889
I'm going to be able to do the Labos drunk on stream.

6500
08:13:09,889 --> 08:13:12,259
But most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff.

6501
08:13:12,259 --> 08:13:13,259
Because I love the game.

6502
08:13:13,259 --> 08:13:15,259
It's my absolute favorite game.

6503
08:13:15,259 --> 08:13:17,259
In the world right now.

6504
08:13:17,259 --> 08:13:19,259
It has been for a while.

6505
08:13:19,259 --> 08:13:21,259
I've been playing Team Fortress since beta.

6506
08:13:21,259 --> 08:13:22,259
How good was I?

6507
08:13:22,259 --> 08:13:24,259
And before that I played Team Fortress Classic.

6508
08:13:24,259 --> 08:13:25,259
How good was I?

6509
08:13:25,259 --> 08:13:26,259
Let's see.

6510
08:13:33,259 --> 08:13:34,259
I still have that problem.

6511
08:13:51,259 --> 08:13:52,259
Three fucking stabs.

6512
08:13:52,259 --> 08:13:53,259
Beautiful.

6513
08:13:54,259 --> 08:13:55,259
Letron J.

6514
08:13:55,259 --> 08:13:56,259
Idiot.

6515
08:14:04,259 --> 08:14:06,909
Getting right to the point.

6516
08:14:06,909 --> 08:14:07,909
I agree.

6517
08:14:24,909 --> 08:14:38,909
This is a big problem.

6518
08:14:38,909 --> 08:14:42,909
Tuber Voice?

6519
08:14:42,909 --> 08:14:44,909
This is me just talking.

6520
08:14:44,909 --> 08:14:47,909
I didn't bring the Tuber Voice out until like a year or two later.

6521
08:14:55,909 --> 08:14:56,909
I don't understand why that happened.

6522
08:14:56,909 --> 08:14:59,909
That there was something going on in the video editing process.

6523
08:14:59,909 --> 08:15:00,909
Kill that Heavy.

6524
08:15:00,909 --> 08:15:03,909
I think that Medic was about to charge an Uber or something.

6525
08:15:03,909 --> 08:15:05,909
But he jumps to his death.

6526
08:15:05,909 --> 08:15:07,909
And I don't know why I did that to tell you the truth.

6527
08:15:07,909 --> 08:15:09,909
He could have just ran backwards.

6528
08:15:09,909 --> 08:15:11,909
So I'm still on fire.

6529
08:15:11,909 --> 08:15:12,909
Let me pick this health kit up again.

6530
08:15:12,909 --> 08:15:14,909
Still on fire.

6531
08:15:14,909 --> 08:15:16,909
I'm not sure if it's bugged like I said.

6532
08:15:16,909 --> 08:15:18,340
I love Dead Ringer.

6533
08:15:18,340 --> 08:15:19,340
I love the Spy.

6534
08:15:19,340 --> 08:15:20,340
It's my most played class.

6535
08:15:20,340 --> 08:15:21,340
It is.

6536
08:15:21,340 --> 08:15:24,340
Next to that I think it's Engineer.

6537
08:15:24,340 --> 08:15:25,340
It is?

6538
08:15:25,340 --> 08:15:26,340
Still.

6539
08:15:26,340 --> 08:15:28,340
It's five years later.

6540
08:15:38,340 --> 08:15:40,340
Well that's 2012.

6541
08:15:40,340 --> 08:15:42,340
Well that's maybe okay.

6542
08:15:55,340 --> 08:15:57,340
This Sniper.

6543
08:15:57,340 --> 08:15:59,340
I get him as well with the Revolver.

6544
08:15:59,340 --> 08:16:02,340
Which this Revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them.

6545
08:16:02,340 --> 08:16:07,340
I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health.

6546
08:16:07,340 --> 08:16:09,340
Like some of the classes do.

6547
08:16:09,340 --> 08:16:11,340
But this Scout, I think he's a Spy.

6548
08:16:11,340 --> 08:16:12,340
He thinks I'm a Spy.

6549
08:16:12,340 --> 08:16:14,340
We both go, haha.

6550
08:16:14,340 --> 08:16:21,790
Now watch this part right here.

6551
08:16:21,790 --> 08:16:22,790
I don't understand this part.

6552
08:16:22,790 --> 08:16:24,790
And you'll get a laugh out of this.

6553
08:16:24,790 --> 08:16:25,790
This is a Spy.

6554
08:16:25,790 --> 08:16:27,790
And we both know it.

6555
08:16:27,790 --> 08:16:30,790
But he just keeps on walking.

6556
08:16:30,790 --> 08:16:34,790
Apparently he didn't care that I bumped into him.

6557
08:16:34,790 --> 08:16:36,790
Or that I was a Spy.

6558
08:16:36,790 --> 08:16:37,790
I don't even know.

6559
08:16:37,790 --> 08:16:38,790
I was wrong.

6560
08:16:38,790 --> 08:16:39,790
I'm fucking stupid.

6561
08:16:39,790 --> 08:16:41,790
I was like a child.

6562
08:16:41,790 --> 08:16:42,790
What an idiot.

6563
08:16:42,790 --> 08:16:44,790
I think it was a Bot at first.

6564
08:16:44,790 --> 08:16:47,790
I guess there were a couple Bots on both teams but I still think he was a player.

6565
08:16:47,790 --> 08:16:50,790
I found out that he wasn't.

6566
08:16:50,790 --> 08:16:53,790
So if that was you, shame on you.

6567
08:16:53,790 --> 08:16:56,790
And maybe you'll get better by practicing.

6568
08:16:57,790 --> 08:17:00,790
So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here.

6569
08:17:00,790 --> 08:17:02,790
The Soldier, I get him.

6570
08:17:02,790 --> 08:17:04,790
And that's what it's all about with the Spy.

6571
08:17:04,790 --> 08:17:06,790
Just trying to mess with people's heads.

6572
08:17:06,790 --> 08:17:10,790
And as you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot.

6573
08:17:10,790 --> 08:17:15,790
Because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know, you're a definite guaranteed Spy.

6574
08:17:15,790 --> 08:17:18,790
So I'm trying to pretend like this Scout is my enemy.

6575
08:17:18,790 --> 08:17:21,790
And I fool this Spy.

6576
08:17:21,790 --> 08:17:23,790
But it doesn't matter because I miss anyways.

6577
08:17:23,790 --> 08:17:25,790
And nothing happens from it though.

6578
08:17:25,790 --> 08:17:27,790
He didn't really come after me.

6579
08:17:27,790 --> 08:17:30,790
I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.

6580
08:17:30,790 --> 08:17:31,790
I believe that's...

6581
08:17:31,790 --> 08:17:33,790
What was that?

6582
08:17:33,790 --> 08:17:34,790
Beep beep beep?

6583
08:17:34,790 --> 08:17:36,790
What was beep beep beep?

6584
08:17:36,790 --> 08:17:41,180
I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.

6585
08:17:41,180 --> 08:17:43,180
Nothing happens from it though.

6586
08:17:43,180 --> 08:17:45,180
He didn't really come after me.

6587
08:17:45,180 --> 08:17:48,180
I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.

6588
08:17:48,180 --> 08:17:53,180
I believe that's the same Spy that when he heard me on Cloak, he didn't really come after me.

6589
08:17:53,180 --> 08:17:56,180
He just kind of shot in random directions and that was it.

6590
08:17:56,180 --> 08:17:58,180
So I get this Medic and I get the Soldier.

6591
08:17:58,180 --> 08:18:00,180
I have ruined their days.

6592
08:18:00,180 --> 08:18:04,180
And this is, like I said, the last part of...

6593
08:18:04,180 --> 08:18:09,180
Keep in mind, gotta keep in mind, this is seven years ago.

6594
08:18:09,180 --> 08:18:11,180
Gold Rush, I started a little late.

6595
08:18:11,180 --> 08:18:13,180
The first video I've ever made. Ever.

6596
08:18:13,180 --> 08:18:16,180
But it's okay because this is a pretty good run.

6597
08:18:16,180 --> 08:18:19,180
And I'm still on fire.

6598
08:18:19,180 --> 08:18:22,180
Nice little jumping, little side-stab on that Medic.

6599
08:18:22,180 --> 08:18:27,180
And yeah, I had to bring up the Dead Ringer because there's no way I would have survived that at all.

6600
08:18:27,180 --> 08:18:29,180
And you were 25.

6601
08:18:29,180 --> 08:18:31,180
That doesn't, but whatever.

6602
08:18:31,180 --> 08:18:33,610
It doesn't matter how old you are.

6603
08:18:33,610 --> 08:18:39,610
Which is the best part about the Dead Ringer because if you had a regular invisibility watch, half of these situations you'd be dead.

6604
08:18:39,610 --> 08:18:41,610
I'd say probably more than half.

6605
08:18:41,610 --> 08:18:47,610
So I try to tele-frag this Engineer and it doesn't really go so well because he's obviously not in the way.

6606
08:18:47,610 --> 08:18:51,610
He actually hits me with his wrench and he doesn't kill me.

6607
08:18:51,610 --> 08:18:55,610
I think I was over you. I think he critted me, actually, to tell you the truth.

6608
08:18:55,610 --> 08:18:59,610
Somebody wrote, I wasn't even alive seven years ago.

6609
08:18:59,610 --> 08:19:07,110
See, right now I'm in no man's land because there's just so many people around and this Heavy knows it, so I'm gonna go down.

6610
08:19:07,110 --> 08:19:11,409
And everyone doesn't really hear it, but I just kind of freak out.

6611
08:19:11,409 --> 08:19:14,409
There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant.

6612
08:19:14,409 --> 08:19:17,409
But hey, I tried and that's when I died.

6613
08:19:17,409 --> 08:19:19,779
So look, I'm still on fire.

6614
08:19:19,779 --> 08:19:20,779
I can't get over it.

6615
08:19:20,779 --> 08:19:23,779
I'm still on fire. I've yet to be put out.

6616
08:19:23,779 --> 08:19:26,779
And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.

6617
08:19:26,779 --> 08:19:30,779
Only when I saved the video.

6618
08:19:30,779 --> 08:19:36,959
So I guess this is some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.

6619
08:19:36,959 --> 08:19:40,959
And it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.

6620
08:19:40,959 --> 08:19:44,959
If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips.

6621
08:19:44,959 --> 08:19:45,959
If you guys do?

6622
08:19:47,959 --> 08:19:50,580
Hold on, I'm asking for tips.

6623
08:19:50,580 --> 08:19:52,580
On how to make commentaries.

6624
08:19:52,580 --> 08:19:54,580
Nobody was doing them.

6625
08:19:54,580 --> 08:19:57,580
There's like nine people making these.

6626
08:19:57,580 --> 08:20:02,580
Where it does this and it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.

6627
08:20:02,580 --> 08:20:10,580
If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here.

6628
08:20:10,580 --> 08:20:16,580
There was probably seven other Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentators in 2011.

6629
08:20:16,580 --> 08:20:20,419
Yeah, but not gonna let it ruin my day.

6630
08:20:20,419 --> 08:20:22,419
It actually subsides right here.

6631
08:20:22,419 --> 08:20:24,419
I had to cut.

6632
08:20:24,419 --> 08:20:26,419
I think something crashed.

6633
08:20:26,419 --> 08:20:28,419
But yeah, it's gone now.

6634
08:20:28,419 --> 08:20:30,419
Wait, hold on. What do I have to do?

6635
08:20:30,419 --> 08:20:32,419
I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.

6636
08:20:32,419 --> 08:20:34,419
If you guys can give me some tips.

6637
08:20:34,419 --> 08:20:37,110
I cut because it crashed?

6638
08:20:37,110 --> 08:20:39,110
What exactly could be going on here, I have no idea.

6639
08:20:39,110 --> 08:20:41,110
I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.

6640
08:20:41,110 --> 08:20:43,110
It actually subsides right here.

6641
08:20:43,110 --> 08:20:45,110
I had to cut.

6642
08:20:45,110 --> 08:20:47,110
Why did I cut?

6643
08:20:47,110 --> 08:20:50,099
I think something crashed.

6644
08:20:50,099 --> 08:20:52,099
That's a lie. What do you mean a cut?

6645
08:20:52,099 --> 08:20:54,529
I had to cut.

6646
08:20:54,529 --> 08:20:58,369
Where?

6647
08:20:58,369 --> 08:21:02,869
Do commentaries if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here.

6648
08:21:02,869 --> 08:21:04,869
I have no idea.

6649
08:21:04,869 --> 08:21:08,000
I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.

6650
08:21:08,000 --> 08:21:10,000
It actually subsides right here.

6651
08:21:10,000 --> 08:21:12,000
I had to cut.

6652
08:21:12,000 --> 08:21:14,000
I think something crashed.

6653
08:21:14,000 --> 08:21:16,000
Something crashed?

6654
08:21:16,000 --> 08:21:18,000
Yeah, it's gone now.

6655
08:21:18,000 --> 08:21:20,000
This is still the same life.

6656
08:21:20,000 --> 08:21:22,000
It's still the same life, I guess.

6657
08:21:22,000 --> 08:21:26,000
So I take the hit from the heavy, bring out the dead ringer, go back to the little spot here.

6658
08:21:26,000 --> 08:21:28,000
This is a great place to go.

6659
08:21:28,000 --> 08:21:30,000
If you don't go here, you should go here every time.

6660
08:21:30,000 --> 08:21:32,000
Go there every time.

6661
08:21:32,000 --> 08:21:34,000
But that other soldier is not gonna have any of that.

6662
08:21:34,000 --> 08:21:38,000
If you're using the dead ringer, that's a really good place to go.

6663
08:21:38,000 --> 08:21:40,000
Because nobody...

6664
08:21:40,000 --> 08:21:42,000
You can see my steam overlay.

6665
08:21:42,000 --> 08:21:46,000
Behind all the sound of the deep look of the dead ringer is very silent.

6666
08:21:46,000 --> 08:21:48,000
So where are the last 10 seconds?

6667
08:21:48,000 --> 08:21:50,000
This person is logging into steam.

6668
08:21:50,000 --> 08:21:56,439
We are winning this, and obviously I come out here to demoralize the other team.

6669
08:21:56,439 --> 08:21:58,799
And it was a pretty good run.

6670
08:21:58,799 --> 08:22:00,799
That was pretty good.

6671
08:22:00,799 --> 08:22:02,799
If you did, let me know.

6672
08:22:02,799 --> 08:22:04,799
Look at that, look at that.

6673
08:22:04,799 --> 08:22:06,979
Who's number one right there?

6674
08:22:06,979 --> 08:22:09,220
That's Jerma.

6675
08:22:09,220 --> 08:22:11,220
Give me a comment, let me know if you want to see something else.

6676
08:22:11,220 --> 08:22:13,220
Or if you guys want to see more.

6677
08:22:13,220 --> 08:22:17,220
I plan on doing it at least a little bit to try and, you know, try and get into it.

6678
08:22:17,220 --> 08:22:19,220
But thanks for watching, and hopefully you guys enjoyed.

6679
08:22:19,220 --> 08:22:21,220
I'll see you later.

6680
08:22:21,220 --> 08:22:23,220
That was the first video I've ever made.

6681
08:22:23,220 --> 08:22:28,340
See you all in the next video.

6682
08:22:28,340 --> 08:22:31,729
I don't even know where we were.

6683
08:22:31,729 --> 08:22:36,470
That video sucked.

6684
08:22:36,470 --> 08:22:39,159
How many viewers did Jerma get in his first stream?

6685
08:22:39,159 --> 08:22:44,869
Um, like Twitch or YouTube?

6686
08:22:44,869 --> 08:22:52,639
When I started, I had an established group of people when I first streamed on Twitch.

6687
08:22:52,639 --> 08:22:57,779
I think my first ever stream was a birthday stream.

6688
08:22:57,779 --> 08:23:02,209
It was like 215 people.

6689
08:23:02,209 --> 08:23:06,209
And it was like, holy shit, I have like an audience that's coming over to Twitch!

6690
08:23:06,209 --> 08:23:08,209
I think it was like 207 people.

6691
08:23:08,209 --> 08:23:10,959
And it was a big deal.

6692
08:23:10,959 --> 08:23:13,400
It was.

6693
08:23:13,400 --> 08:23:15,400
It was like a birthday stream.

6694
08:23:15,400 --> 08:23:18,599
That's still really good.

6695
08:23:18,599 --> 08:23:20,599
Yeah, no, it was great.

6696
08:23:20,599 --> 08:23:25,009
200 fucking people are a lot of people.

6697
08:23:25,009 --> 08:23:32,639
So, 2-3, 400 people, like that's what I was starting with.

6698
08:23:32,639 --> 08:23:34,950
That's still a lot of people.

6699
08:23:34,950 --> 08:23:43,720
If you put 200 people in a room, you've got a giant party.

6700
08:23:43,720 --> 08:23:46,279
So, yeah, no.

6701
08:23:46,279 --> 08:23:48,279
It's been great. I love it.

6702
08:23:48,279 --> 08:23:51,520
Let's get back to what we were doing.

6703
08:23:51,520 --> 08:23:53,520
Now I have more than 5 times that.

6704
08:23:53,520 --> 08:23:55,830
I don't look at it that way though.

6705
08:23:55,830 --> 08:24:03,590
200, 5,000, 10,400, doesn't matter.

6706
08:24:03,590 --> 08:24:06,340
I'm gonna still do the things that I'm gonna do.

6707
08:24:06,340 --> 08:24:15,360
But, yeah, whoever linked that, thank you.

6708
08:24:15,360 --> 08:24:17,360
We are getting closer to the end here.

6709
08:24:17,360 --> 08:24:24,159
Thank you so much to Matters of Darkness, 15 bucks.

6710
08:24:46,549 --> 08:24:52,040
Thank you.

6711
08:24:52,040 --> 08:24:54,040
Somebody wrote, Jerma's an inspiration.

6712
08:24:54,040 --> 08:24:59,360
I don't know if you get inspiration from the stuff that I do and the stuff that you see here.

6713
08:24:59,360 --> 08:25:02,369
Good, I'm glad.

6714
08:25:02,369 --> 08:25:05,000
I'm glad you can do something from it.

6715
08:25:05,000 --> 08:25:07,000
Have fun.

6716
08:25:07,000 --> 08:25:09,000
Glad you can make something from it.

6717
08:25:09,000 --> 08:25:12,069
Cry, cry, cry, cry.

6718
08:25:12,069 --> 08:25:18,470
But for real, thank you for the huge amount of money tonight, dude.

6719
08:25:18,470 --> 08:25:20,470
Thank you so much.

6720
08:25:20,470 --> 08:25:22,709
Green Templar, thanks for the 4 dollars.

6721
08:25:22,709 --> 08:25:24,709
No message, thank you.

6722
08:25:24,709 --> 08:25:26,709
Shirt, thanks for the dollar and 10 cents.

6723
08:25:26,709 --> 08:25:30,680
Shirt 113.

6724
08:25:30,680 --> 08:25:33,430
Manfun, thanks for the one dollar.

6725
08:25:33,430 --> 08:25:35,860
Appreciate it.

6726
08:25:35,860 --> 08:25:39,250
SaintMP, thanks for the one dollar.

6727
08:25:39,250 --> 08:25:42,259
Littlesmoop, thanks for the one dollar.

6728
08:25:42,259 --> 08:25:48,259
No messages here, just people kind of throwing money into the pot here and it's very much appreciated.

6729
08:25:48,259 --> 08:25:51,400
Thank you, guys.

6730
08:25:51,400 --> 08:25:53,400
Butterderp, thanks for the 15 bucks.

6731
08:25:53,400 --> 08:25:55,400
Jeremy, I don't leave your stream saying that was fun.

6732
08:25:55,400 --> 08:25:57,400
I leave your stream saying no, please don't leave.

6733
08:25:57,400 --> 08:25:59,700
We touched upon this earlier.

6734
08:25:59,700 --> 08:26:02,840
But again, Butterderp, thank you so much.

6735
08:26:02,840 --> 08:26:06,799
I'm glad you can have a good fucking time.

6736
08:26:08,799 --> 08:26:15,200
AmnesiaStreamer.

6737
08:26:23,000 --> 08:26:25,000
Should have recommended that I cry on the green screen.

6738
08:26:25,000 --> 08:26:28,130
I probably will.

6739
08:26:28,130 --> 08:26:30,439
Jerma, are you a US citizen?

6740
08:26:30,439 --> 08:26:32,740
Yeah, yes.

6741
08:26:32,740 --> 08:26:34,740
I think, I think so.

6742
08:26:34,740 --> 08:26:40,759
Thank you, though.

6743
08:26:40,759 --> 08:26:45,880
Thank you to Koalav3Jance.

6744
08:26:45,880 --> 08:26:51,459
KoalavGance.

6745
08:26:51,459 --> 08:26:53,459
I'm saying your name so wrong, I'm sorry, but thank you.

6746
08:26:53,459 --> 08:26:56,279
Thanks for the bits there, dude.

6747
08:26:56,279 --> 08:26:58,279
Thank you, DeuceTheGamer.

6748
08:26:58,279 --> 08:27:00,840
Again, we gotta touch upon this.

6749
08:27:00,840 --> 08:27:04,840
This is the most amount of money that anyone has ever given me during one stream.

6750
08:27:04,840 --> 08:27:07,779
A thousand fucking dollars.

6751
08:27:07,779 --> 08:27:11,779
Absolutely fucking insane amount of money.

6752
08:27:11,779 --> 08:27:17,270
Thank you.

6753
08:27:17,270 --> 08:27:20,849
DeuceTheGamer, that means a lot.

6754
08:27:20,849 --> 08:27:22,849
Thank you so much, dude.

6755
08:27:22,849 --> 08:27:25,479
That's the most fucking money ever.

6756
08:27:25,479 --> 08:27:31,490
Watch your language, I'm sorry.

6757
08:27:31,490 --> 08:27:34,049
Thank you Carrot for the five dollars.

6758
08:27:34,049 --> 08:27:38,049
There's a stream where we bullied Jerma by throwing money at him until he cried.

6759
08:27:38,049 --> 08:27:46,639
Well worth it for the greatest funny man on Twitch.

6760
08:27:46,639 --> 08:27:48,639
I know we all appreciate how hard you worked, so please.

6761
08:27:48,639 --> 08:27:52,639
To please us, greedy gremlins sitting at home.

6762
08:27:52,639 --> 08:27:56,290
Much love.

6763
08:27:56,290 --> 08:27:58,290
Thank you, Carrot.

6764
08:27:58,290 --> 08:28:05,520
I don't think you guys are greedy at all.

6765
08:28:05,520 --> 08:28:07,889
GarfieldTheMondayKillit, there's Garfield.

6766
08:28:07,889 --> 08:28:09,889
Thank you, Garfield, for the one dollar.

6767
08:28:09,889 --> 08:28:11,889
Ahoy there, landlubbers.

6768
08:28:11,889 --> 08:28:13,889
Ahoy in that. Come on, Jerma, burn that fat.

6769
08:28:13,889 --> 08:28:16,889
I'm glad you found out I'm interning at Nintendo.

6770
08:28:16,889 --> 08:28:20,889
They wanted to use my writing skills for Garfographs in their game.

6771
08:28:20,889 --> 08:28:23,889
Unfortunately, the Labo branch of the company was closed down.

6772
08:28:23,889 --> 08:28:26,889
I'm emptying out my office as we speak.

6773
08:28:26,889 --> 08:28:28,889
Yeah, they gave an office to an intern.

6774
08:28:28,889 --> 08:28:32,889
Hey, Jerma, when you lie in bed and think how the stream was possible,

6775
08:28:32,889 --> 08:28:38,729
imagine Garfield fishing for trout in Alaska and donating trout bits.

6776
08:28:38,729 --> 08:28:42,060
Thank you.

6777
08:28:42,060 --> 08:28:44,060
Thank you, Garfield.

6778
08:28:44,060 --> 08:28:47,060
Hopefully Nintendo brings you back.

6779
08:28:47,060 --> 08:28:52,729
Thank you, WinzRind, for the five dollars.

6780
08:28:52,729 --> 08:28:55,099
Hey, Jerma, I have this relevant image.

6781
08:28:55,099 --> 08:29:00,939
Okay, why did you send a check for ten thousand dollars to Jerma985?

6782
08:29:00,939 --> 08:29:02,939
I like their product.

6783
08:29:02,939 --> 08:29:05,939
I wanted them to have a little walking around money.

6784
08:29:05,939 --> 08:29:09,840
Here is the image.

6785
08:29:09,840 --> 08:29:12,169
Thank you.

6786
08:29:12,169 --> 08:29:15,369
Thank you, WinzRind.

6787
08:29:15,369 --> 08:29:17,849
Walking around money.

6788
08:29:17,849 --> 08:29:18,849
But thanks to the five bucks, dude.

6789
08:29:18,849 --> 08:29:23,029
Thank you, Tantyrotenna, for the one dollar.

6790
08:29:23,029 --> 08:29:26,290
Sniff update, please.

6791
08:29:26,290 --> 08:29:27,290
Sniff update.

6792
08:29:27,290 --> 08:29:30,409
What does that mean?

6793
08:29:30,409 --> 08:29:34,639
Sniff update?

6794
08:29:34,639 --> 08:29:35,639
I don't understand.

6795
08:29:35,639 --> 08:29:36,639
Oh, the dog smell.

6796
08:29:36,639 --> 08:29:39,599
Yeah, whatever.

6797
08:29:39,599 --> 08:29:40,599
Thank you.

6798
08:29:40,599 --> 08:29:43,099
Funny and relatable username for the one dollar.

6799
08:29:43,099 --> 08:29:46,599
Hey, Jerma, here's a dollar to fuel your crippling chicken nugget addiction.

6800
08:29:46,599 --> 08:29:50,159
We touched upon it earlier, but thank you.

6801
08:29:50,159 --> 08:29:52,159
Devakitty, thanks for the one dollar, Devakitty.

6802
08:29:52,159 --> 08:29:54,720
Just add this to the money pile, Jerma.

6803
08:29:54,720 --> 08:30:00,720
On another note, I've been feeling awful about how long it has taken for me to get HRT.

6804
08:30:00,720 --> 08:30:04,959
But one of my last appointments with my clinician is in early December,

6805
08:30:04,959 --> 08:30:08,130
and you helped me hold myself from falling apart in the last eight years.

6806
08:30:08,130 --> 08:30:12,130
I've had to endure dysphoria, and for that I am sincerely grateful.

6807
08:30:12,130 --> 08:30:16,369
So wish me luck in getting myself some tit-tax.

6808
08:30:16,369 --> 08:30:18,369
We all love you, Jerma, transgender pride.

6809
08:30:18,369 --> 08:30:21,759
Thank you so much, Devakitty.

6810
08:30:21,759 --> 08:30:27,240
I will tell you, like I've said this before a thousand times,

6811
08:30:27,240 --> 08:30:33,639
be the person that you are the most comfortable being.

6812
08:30:33,639 --> 08:30:37,479
Whatever you're the most comfortable being, whoever you are,

6813
08:30:37,479 --> 08:30:38,479
much love to you, for real.

6814
08:30:38,479 --> 08:30:46,400
Whoever, wherever, whenever.

6815
08:30:46,400 --> 08:30:48,400
I've said it before, but I will reiterate it again.

6816
08:30:48,400 --> 08:30:54,340
Thank you so much.

6817
08:30:54,340 --> 08:31:01,790
Best of luck to you.

6818
08:31:01,790 --> 08:31:03,790
And we move on to Tiny.

6819
08:31:03,790 --> 08:31:05,790
Thank you, Tiny, 840 for the 10 bucks.

6820
08:31:05,790 --> 08:31:08,159
I can't give nearly as much as some people here.

6821
08:31:08,159 --> 08:31:10,590
We touched upon this before.

6822
08:31:10,590 --> 08:31:13,599
Show my appreciation for what you do for all of us.

6823
08:31:13,599 --> 08:31:14,599
Thank you.

6824
08:31:14,599 --> 08:31:15,900
Thank you, Tiny.

6825
08:31:15,900 --> 08:31:18,419
Thank you for everything.

6826
08:31:18,419 --> 08:31:21,880
Dubski, dude, thanks for the one dollar.

6827
08:31:21,880 --> 08:31:24,880
Jerma, you are the worst influence on my life.

6828
08:31:24,880 --> 08:31:25,880
Holy shit.

6829
08:31:25,880 --> 08:31:26,880
This got different.

6830
08:31:26,880 --> 08:31:27,880
This got like a little weird.

6831
08:31:27,880 --> 08:31:30,880
I thought it was going to be like, oh, thanks.

6832
08:31:30,880 --> 08:31:31,880
Nope.

6833
08:31:31,880 --> 08:31:32,880
Not this one.

6834
08:31:32,880 --> 08:31:35,880
Jerma, you're the worst influence on my life.

6835
08:31:35,880 --> 08:31:39,880
Your stream has made me extremely paranoid of people who just want to steal my expensive rifle.

6836
08:31:39,880 --> 08:31:42,880
And you convinced me to hijack a train and fill it with corpses.

6837
08:31:42,880 --> 08:31:45,880
Worst of all, I said ha ha pee pee poo poo to my own mother.

6838
08:31:45,880 --> 08:31:46,880
Arrest this person.

6839
08:31:46,880 --> 08:31:47,880
Arrest this streamer.

6840
08:31:47,880 --> 08:31:53,380
There's so many like, nice.

6841
08:31:53,380 --> 08:31:54,380
Oh, thank you so much.

6842
08:31:54,380 --> 08:31:56,380
And then, oh, you're the worst.

6843
08:31:56,380 --> 08:32:01,909
Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious.

6844
08:32:01,909 --> 08:32:02,909
Thank you, Dubski.

6845
08:32:02,909 --> 08:32:03,909
Sorry to hear about that.

6846
08:32:03,909 --> 08:32:07,209
ACDC, freak, thanks for the bits.

6847
08:32:07,209 --> 08:32:09,639
It's not much, but you're my favorite person on Twitch.

6848
08:32:09,639 --> 08:32:12,099
Thank you.

6849
08:32:12,099 --> 08:32:15,040
Devakitty, thanks for the one dollar.

6850
08:32:15,040 --> 08:32:16,040
Again, thank you, Devakitty.

6851
08:32:16,040 --> 08:32:20,040
Oh yeah, I also just finished a marathon-length domination-only game of Civilization V,

6852
08:32:20,040 --> 08:32:22,040
so just call me a regular fucking pro gamer.

6853
08:32:22,040 --> 08:32:24,439
How long is that?

6854
08:32:24,439 --> 08:32:28,279
How long does that take?

6855
08:32:28,279 --> 08:32:29,840
That's a long time.

6856
08:32:29,840 --> 08:32:37,860
A marathon-length domination-only game.

6857
08:32:37,860 --> 08:32:41,680
Is that like, that's actually so long.

6858
08:32:41,680 --> 08:32:43,750
How long?

6859
08:32:44,750 --> 08:32:45,750
That's a lot.

6860
08:32:45,750 --> 08:32:48,049
Maybe like 50 hours?

6861
08:32:48,049 --> 08:32:49,049
Holy shit.

6862
08:32:49,049 --> 08:32:51,639
At least an hour.

6863
08:32:51,639 --> 08:32:54,520
Well, congratulations on that.

6864
08:32:54,520 --> 08:32:57,270
Civ 5.

6865
08:32:57,270 --> 08:32:58,270
Never played it.

6866
08:32:58,270 --> 08:33:01,000
I respect it, though.

6867
08:33:01,000 --> 08:33:04,000
Rocketfinger, thanks for the six dollars and 50 cents.

6868
08:33:04,000 --> 08:33:05,000
Jerma Hart, no message.

6869
08:33:05,000 --> 08:33:07,000
Thank you, but just Jerma Hart.

6870
08:33:07,000 --> 08:33:09,560
Right back at you.

6871
08:33:09,560 --> 08:33:13,560
Thank you, JupaCross, for the 95 cents.

6872
08:33:13,560 --> 08:33:14,560
One dollar, round it up there.

6873
08:33:14,560 --> 08:33:15,560
Jerma, we all love you.

6874
08:33:15,560 --> 08:33:16,560
You lack in height.

6875
08:33:16,560 --> 08:33:17,560
You make up with personality.

6876
08:33:17,560 --> 08:33:21,560
You're an inspiration, proving that even short men can get a girlfriend.

6877
08:33:21,560 --> 08:33:24,560
And I rounded you 95 cents up to a dollar.

6878
08:33:24,560 --> 08:33:26,119
And that's what I said.

6879
08:33:26,119 --> 08:33:27,119
And that's what you said.

6880
08:33:27,119 --> 08:33:30,119
All right, great.

6881
08:33:30,119 --> 08:33:32,119
Should have just rounded it down.

6882
08:33:32,119 --> 08:33:34,119
Thanks for the 95 cents.

6883
08:33:34,119 --> 08:33:36,299
Appreciate it, JupaCross.

6884
08:33:36,299 --> 08:33:37,479
Appreciate that, dude.

6885
08:33:37,479 --> 08:33:38,479
Thank you.

6886
08:33:38,479 --> 08:33:39,479
And yes, it's true.

6887
08:33:39,479 --> 08:33:40,479
It doesn't matter.

6888
08:33:40,479 --> 08:33:41,479
Everyone will find somebody.

6889
08:33:41,479 --> 08:33:42,479
You are correct.

6890
08:33:42,479 --> 08:33:44,479
Thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the two dollars and 76 cents.

6891
08:33:44,479 --> 08:33:47,650
Here's your thousand dollars of Zimbabwe dollars.

6892
08:33:47,650 --> 08:33:48,650
Thank you, Sticks.

6893
08:33:48,650 --> 08:33:49,650
Welcome back.

6894
08:33:49,650 --> 08:33:51,150
Much love to you, dude.

6895
08:33:51,150 --> 08:33:58,680
Round it down like it's height.

6896
08:33:58,680 --> 08:34:00,680
Busy Work, thanks for the three bucks, Busy Work.

6897
08:34:00,680 --> 08:34:02,860
Grab that auto, owes you money.

6898
08:34:02,860 --> 08:34:06,569
Thanks for the three bucks, Busy Work.

6899
08:34:06,569 --> 08:34:07,569
Appreciate that.

6900
08:34:07,569 --> 08:34:12,240
Dot Shaft, thanks for the 10 bucks, Dot Shaft.

6901
08:34:12,240 --> 08:34:14,240
Just cry so we can go to bed.

6902
08:34:14,240 --> 08:34:15,799
It was close.

6903
08:34:15,799 --> 08:34:16,799
Almost got me.

6904
08:34:16,799 --> 08:34:19,560
But I did start thinking about it.

6905
08:34:19,560 --> 08:34:22,560
And it was making me really, really emotional.

6906
08:34:22,560 --> 08:34:23,560
But I was good.

6907
08:34:23,560 --> 08:34:26,560
I had a couple more glasses of wine, and I was all set.

6908
08:34:26,560 --> 08:34:30,919
Thank you, though, Dot Shaft, for the 10, 10 dollars.

6909
08:34:30,919 --> 08:34:34,060
Flying Sombrero, thanks for the one dollar.

6910
08:34:34,060 --> 08:34:36,060
Everyone has given bits tonight, so here's my contribution.

6911
08:34:36,060 --> 08:34:40,430
I'm hoping you do a germa ultimate rumble when the new Smash Brothers comes out.

6912
08:34:40,430 --> 08:34:42,430
Thanks for the streams.

6913
08:34:42,430 --> 08:34:44,799
You'll always be our favorite tiny man.

6914
08:34:44,799 --> 08:34:47,250
Five eight.

6915
08:34:47,250 --> 08:34:50,630
I mean, who's counting, right?

6916
08:34:50,630 --> 08:34:51,630
Five eight.

6917
08:34:51,630 --> 08:34:52,630
Five foot eight.

6918
08:34:52,630 --> 08:34:55,509
Five foot eight inches.

6919
08:34:55,509 --> 08:34:59,560
Five feet, and then eight inches after five feet.

6920
08:34:59,560 --> 08:35:00,930
Five eight.

6921
08:35:00,930 --> 08:35:04,200
Five seven, but five eight with shoes on.

6922
08:35:04,200 --> 08:35:07,509
Let me correct that.

6923
08:35:07,509 --> 08:35:08,509
Thank you.

6924
08:35:08,509 --> 08:35:10,509
Thank you, Onyx Blaze, for the three bucks.

6925
08:35:10,509 --> 08:35:11,509

6926
08:35:11,509 --> 08:35:12,509
Thank you, Pogchamp.

6927
08:35:12,509 --> 08:35:15,509
Well, thank you, Onyx Blaze, for your Pogchamps, for the three bucks.

6928
08:35:15,509 --> 08:35:18,709
Onyx Blaze again, for the two dollars.

6929
08:35:18,709 --> 08:35:19,709
Thanos car.

6930
08:35:19,709 --> 08:35:22,139
Some meme, I guess.

6931
08:35:22,139 --> 08:35:25,209
Digit Guy, thanks for the one dollar.

6932
08:35:25,209 --> 08:35:26,209
I found this in my couch cushions.

6933
08:35:26,209 --> 08:35:27,209
Am I cool yet?

6934
08:35:27,209 --> 08:35:29,450
Also, chug that.

6935
08:35:29,450 --> 08:35:30,819
I believe I did.

6936
08:35:30,819 --> 08:35:32,759
Thank you.

6937
08:35:32,759 --> 08:35:34,759
For another dollar, Digit Guy, I'm the guy in the car.

6938
08:35:34,759 --> 08:35:40,610
I don't know what that means.

6939
08:35:40,610 --> 08:35:41,610
I don't know what that means.

6940
08:35:41,610 --> 08:35:42,610
I'm the guy in the car.

6941
08:35:42,610 --> 08:35:46,159
Thanks.

6942
08:35:46,159 --> 08:35:49,159
Sieg's Corner, thanks for the one dollar.

6943
08:35:49,159 --> 08:35:51,159
I'm the guy next to the guy in the car.

6944
08:35:51,159 --> 08:35:55,799
We both drive.

6945
08:35:55,799 --> 08:35:56,799
All right.

6946
08:35:56,799 --> 08:36:00,229
Thank you, Sieg's Corner and Digit Guy.

6947
08:36:00,229 --> 08:36:03,229
Creepy Ghost Sales, thanks for one dollar.

6948
08:36:03,229 --> 08:36:05,979
I need to get in on this.

6949
08:36:05,979 --> 08:36:07,729
Oh, the loud car that drove by.

6950
08:36:07,729 --> 08:36:08,729
Right, okay.

6951
08:36:08,729 --> 08:36:09,729
That makes sense.

6952
08:36:09,729 --> 08:36:11,040
Thank you, Creepy Ghost Sales.

6953
08:36:11,040 --> 08:36:16,939
Thank you to a ton of people who gave 50 cents.

6954
08:36:16,939 --> 08:36:19,080
A bunch of you in a row.

6955
08:36:19,080 --> 08:36:23,360
Thank you, all of you.

Swiggity Dank, thanks for the 15 bucks, Swiggity Dank.

6957
08:36:26,360 --> 08:36:27,360
Let's get those bits.

6958
08:36:27,360 --> 08:36:29,310
Okay.

6959
08:36:29,310 --> 08:36:33,889
YouTuber for five years have video from seven years ago.

6960
08:36:33,889 --> 08:36:42,240
Well, I haven't updated my biography on Twitch in two years, so that makes sense.

6961
08:36:42,240 --> 08:36:44,240
Swiggity Dank, thanks for 15 dollars, dude.

6962
08:36:44,240 --> 08:36:45,479
Let's get those bits.

6963
08:36:45,479 --> 08:36:50,040
Well, you brought a bunch of them, so thank you.

6964
08:36:50,040 --> 08:36:52,040
Shimmy Sham, thanks for two bucks.

6965
08:36:52,040 --> 08:36:55,409
I want to see Italics's face.

6966
08:36:55,409 --> 08:36:57,409
Sorry, you can't see his face.

6967
08:36:57,409 --> 08:37:00,790
He is faceless tonight.

6968
08:37:00,790 --> 08:37:02,790
More, a bunch of 50 cents coming in from a ton of people.

6969
08:37:02,790 --> 08:37:03,790
Thank you guys so much.

6970
08:37:03,790 --> 08:37:06,349
Ton of gifted fucking subs.

6971
08:37:06,349 --> 08:37:09,479
Thank you, Trotter, for the one dollar.

6972
08:37:09,479 --> 08:37:11,479
Get that bread, my gamer.

6973
08:37:11,479 --> 08:37:12,479
And Germanose, wipe German heart.

6974
08:37:12,479 --> 08:37:18,349
Your Twitch bio is when you only had five emotes.

6975
08:37:18,349 --> 08:37:20,349
Yeah, but those are like the five good ones.

6976
08:37:20,349 --> 08:37:25,000
Actually, there's like at least 10 more that I would say are good.

6977
08:37:25,000 --> 08:37:28,520
Good ones.

6978
08:37:28,520 --> 08:37:32,840
I have like 15 great emotes now.

6979
08:37:32,840 --> 08:37:37,599
Thank you, Trotter, though.

6980
08:37:37,599 --> 08:37:38,599
The one dollar.

6981
08:37:38,599 --> 08:37:39,599
Get that bread.

6982
08:37:39,599 --> 08:37:40,599
I won't for now.

6983
08:37:40,599 --> 08:37:41,840
Star Wolf Ken.

6984
08:37:41,840 --> 08:37:43,840

For the one dollar.

6987
08:37:45,840 --> 08:37:46,840
Thank you, German heart.

6988
08:37:46,840 --> 08:37:48,849
No message.

6989
08:37:48,849 --> 08:37:50,090
Thank you.

6990
08:37:50,090 --> 08:37:51,090
No comment.

6991
08:37:51,090 --> 08:37:54,189
34 gave one dollar.

6992
08:37:54,189 --> 08:37:55,189
I suck.

6993
08:37:55,189 --> 08:38:00,080
I'm bored when I do that.

6994
08:38:00,080 --> 08:38:02,000
Kappa.

6995
08:38:02,000 --> 08:38:04,240
You suck on Tootsie Rolls.

6996
08:38:04,240 --> 08:38:06,680
Thank you for that.

6997
08:38:06,680 --> 08:38:07,680
No comment.

6998
08:38:07,680 --> 08:38:08,680
34.

6999
08:38:08,680 --> 08:38:09,680
Thank you.

7000
08:38:09,680 --> 08:38:10,919
It is Kat.

7001
08:38:10,919 --> 08:38:12,729
Thanks for the bits.

7002
08:38:12,729 --> 08:38:13,729
Thank you, Star Wolf Ken, for the one dollar.

7003
08:38:13,729 --> 08:38:15,729
Is this a streamer who cried on stream?

7004
08:38:15,729 --> 08:38:16,729
I didn't.

7005
08:38:16,729 --> 08:38:18,869
I did not.

7006
08:38:18,869 --> 08:38:22,169
Thank you, FussyFuck, for the one dollar.

7007
08:38:22,169 --> 08:38:32,639
Thank you, WinzRyant, for the three bucks.

7008
08:38:32,639 --> 08:38:38,590
Your streams are getting me through fall classes while I have a chronic sinus infection,

7009
08:38:38,590 --> 08:38:40,209
so you're priceless.

7010
08:38:40,209 --> 08:38:41,209
Keep up the good times.

7011
08:38:41,209 --> 08:38:43,959
Thank you, WinzRyant, for the three bucks.

7012
08:38:43,959 --> 08:38:45,459
Good luck on your fall classes.

7013
08:38:45,459 --> 08:38:48,459
Hopefully you get an A- on all of them.

7014
08:38:48,459 --> 08:38:49,959
Thank you.

7015
08:38:49,959 --> 08:38:52,279
The long egg.

7016
08:38:52,279 --> 08:38:53,279
Thanks for one dollar.

7017
08:38:53,279 --> 08:38:54,279
Very emotional stream.

7018
08:38:54,279 --> 08:38:56,279
I almost cried myself.

7019
08:38:56,279 --> 08:38:59,279
Maybe it's from painkillers from my surgery, but you demand.

7020
08:38:59,279 --> 08:39:00,459
Hopefully your surgery went well.

7021
08:39:00,459 --> 08:39:07,759
Hopefully you're recovering, and hopefully you get stronger every day.

7022
08:39:07,759 --> 08:39:08,759
Thank you so much.

7023
08:39:08,759 --> 08:39:12,110
The long egg.

7024
08:39:12,110 --> 08:39:14,110
He used to play the A- thing before B+.

7025
08:39:14,110 --> 08:39:18,400
You got to wish everybody for a B+.

7026
08:39:18,400 --> 08:39:19,889
Double 11.

7027
08:39:19,889 --> 08:39:20,889
Thanks for the one dollar.

7028
08:39:20,889 --> 08:39:21,889
Double D. Double 11.

7029
08:39:21,889 --> 08:39:23,520
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

7030
08:39:23,520 --> 08:39:26,520
Welcome to episode one of Dermacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

7031
08:39:26,520 --> 08:39:27,520
This is going to be a single player.

7032
08:39:27,520 --> 08:39:30,520
I said what you wanted me to do.

7033
08:39:30,520 --> 08:39:33,689
DivUSP, thanks for the 10 bucks.

7034
08:39:33,689 --> 08:39:35,689
I'm running out of ad bits, but fuck it.

7035
08:39:35,689 --> 08:39:36,689
Laughing my ass off.

7036
08:39:36,689 --> 08:39:40,689
Thank you, DivUSP, for your multiple contributions.

7037
08:39:40,689 --> 08:39:42,700
10 bucks.

7038
08:39:42,700 --> 08:39:44,959
10 bucks here.

7039
08:39:44,959 --> 08:39:48,959
Tons of money over the course of the last at least few months.

7040
08:39:48,959 --> 08:39:49,959
Thanks a lot, man.

7041
08:39:49,959 --> 08:39:53,900
Zareth, thanks for five dollars, Zareth.

7042
08:39:53,900 --> 08:39:58,159
I've been following you for a few years, and you never failed to make my days better.

7043
08:39:58,159 --> 08:39:59,159
Thank you for all you've done.

7044
08:39:59,159 --> 08:40:03,810
Thank you for the five dollars, and thanks for being here.

7045
08:40:03,810 --> 08:40:05,880
Ten dollars out of ads.

7046
08:40:05,880 --> 08:40:06,880
That is a lot.

7047
08:40:06,880 --> 08:40:11,470
TwoBit, thank you TwoBit for the three bucks.

7048
08:40:11,470 --> 08:40:12,470
Jerma, you deserve every bit you get.

7049
08:40:12,470 --> 08:40:17,639
I wish I could give more because of every year since I found you on YouTube seven years ago.

7050
08:40:17,639 --> 08:40:19,880
Thank you, and here's to many more.

7051
08:40:19,880 --> 08:40:23,560
I'm going to go as long as I can.

7052
08:40:23,560 --> 08:40:27,369

08:40:27,369 --> 08:40:30,740
Truna, thank you Truna for the ten dollars.

7054
08:40:30,740 --> 08:40:31,740
Ten bucks from Truna.

7055
08:40:31,740 --> 08:40:35,240
Hey dude, I don't really know how Twitch works as I always watch you on YouTube,

7056
08:40:35,240 --> 08:40:38,240
but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what you do.

7057
08:40:38,240 --> 08:40:40,540
You make me cry laughing more times than I can count,

7058
08:40:40,540 --> 08:40:42,540
and you never fail to cheer me up.

7059
08:40:42,540 --> 08:40:43,909
Love you, dude.

7060
08:40:43,909 --> 08:40:45,790
Thank you, Truna.

7061
08:40:50,229 --> 08:40:59,319
Add yourself to the list of people that have just given such immense support over the years,

7062
08:40:59,319 --> 08:41:03,069
and thank you so much for watching on YouTube.

7063
08:41:03,069 --> 08:41:07,569
It means a lot.

7064
08:41:07,569 --> 08:41:08,569
That's fucking incredible.

7065
08:41:08,569 --> 08:41:10,200
Thank you.

7066
08:41:10,200 --> 08:41:11,200
I'm glad you enjoy it.

7067
08:41:11,200 --> 08:41:12,200
I'm glad you're having fun.

7068
08:41:12,200 --> 08:41:18,169
Welcome to Twitch, by the way.

7069
08:41:18,169 --> 08:41:21,169
If you're not a Twitch viewer, welcome to Twitch.

7070
08:41:21,169 --> 08:41:23,119
No comment.

7071
08:41:23,119 --> 08:41:24,119
Thanks for the one dollar, no comment.

7072
08:41:24,119 --> 08:41:26,680
One dollar and nine cents.

7073
08:41:26,680 --> 08:41:31,680
They say this is just all my money, and well actually it's two dollars and ten cents.

7074
08:41:31,680 --> 08:41:35,360
They say I'm gay, and this is all my money.

7075
08:41:35,360 --> 08:41:41,139
Pride one ten, or pride two ten, actually.

7076
08:41:41,139 --> 08:41:44,279
Thank you so much, no comment.

7077
08:41:44,279 --> 08:41:45,279
Thanks for the two bucks.

7078
08:41:45,279 --> 08:41:54,259
Appreciate that.

7079
08:41:54,259 --> 08:41:58,759
Wish you the best.

7080
08:41:58,759 --> 08:42:00,759
Thank you, pop them tarts.

7081
08:42:00,759 --> 08:42:03,520
I'd give so much more if I could.

7082
08:42:03,520 --> 08:42:05,520
You're generally a nice guy, and you deserve the world.

7083
08:42:05,520 --> 08:42:08,840
Maybe a small piece of the world.

7084
08:42:08,840 --> 08:42:09,840
Not all of it, though.

7085
08:42:09,840 --> 08:42:10,840
It's too much.

7086
08:42:10,840 --> 08:42:12,840
Nobody wants that much.

7087
08:42:12,840 --> 08:42:14,720
It's too much world.

7088
08:42:14,720 --> 08:42:16,720
That's too much world to have, you know what I mean?

7089
08:42:18,729 --> 08:42:20,729
Sapping my bin yacht.

7090
08:42:20,729 --> 08:42:21,729
Thanks for the 95 cents.

7091
08:42:21,729 --> 08:42:22,729
Rounding it up to a dollar.

7092
08:42:22,729 --> 08:42:23,729
What we're doing tonight here.

7093
08:42:23,729 --> 08:42:25,479
That's what we're doing.

7094
08:42:25,479 --> 08:42:26,479
Hey, Jerma, thanks for streaming.

7095
08:42:26,479 --> 08:42:32,790
Ever since I found you a while ago through a certain droney, you've brightened up my days.

7096
08:42:32,790 --> 08:42:35,790
Here's a hundred bits for every time you've made me laugh and smile.

7097
08:42:35,790 --> 08:42:40,909
Here's a hundred bits for every time you've made me laugh.

7098
08:42:40,909 --> 08:42:41,909
This is 95.

7099
08:42:41,909 --> 08:42:43,659
How many?

7100
08:42:43,659 --> 08:42:46,220
So I've only made you smile once.

7101
08:42:49,099 --> 08:42:50,099
Oh, not even.

7102
08:42:50,099 --> 08:42:53,389
95.

7103
08:42:54,389 --> 08:42:56,909
Oh, man.

7104
08:42:56,909 --> 08:42:57,909
That's good.

7105
08:42:57,909 --> 08:43:00,209
Well, Vinny is a great fucking guy.

7106
08:43:00,209 --> 08:43:04,599
So I'm happy you even came over here from Vinny's channel.

7107
08:43:04,599 --> 08:43:06,599
He's a fucking fantastic streamer.

7108
08:43:06,599 --> 08:43:09,360
And he is a friend.

7109
08:43:09,360 --> 08:43:12,110
So it's great, dude.

7110
08:43:12,110 --> 08:43:19,979
Thank you to Brand The Mans for the one dollar.

7111
08:43:19,979 --> 08:43:23,979
Hey, Jerma, the work you do here on Twitch is truly amazing, and your streams are worth every penny.

7112
08:43:23,979 --> 08:43:25,979
Don't ever doubt yourself of the value of the streams.

7113
08:43:25,979 --> 08:43:26,979
We love you.

7114
08:43:26,979 --> 08:43:31,270
Thank you, Brand The Man.

7115
08:43:31,270 --> 08:43:35,709
Really appreciate that.

7116
08:43:35,709 --> 08:43:36,709
Thanks for the kind words.

7117
08:43:37,709 --> 08:43:40,200
I am a Ribbit.

7118
08:43:40,200 --> 08:43:41,200
Thanks for one dollar.

7119
08:43:41,200 --> 08:43:42,200
No message.

7120
08:43:42,200 --> 08:43:43,439
Elizabeth.

7121
08:43:43,439 --> 08:43:44,439
Thanks for one dollar.

7122
08:43:44,439 --> 08:43:46,439
Did you see Vinny talking about how you landed in Vegas?

7123
08:43:46,439 --> 08:43:47,439
Yeah.

7124
08:43:47,439 --> 08:43:48,810
I was in his dryer.

7125
08:43:48,810 --> 08:43:51,810
We talked about his dryer and how, you know, he puts some raw meat in there.

7126
08:43:51,810 --> 08:43:54,049
It's in the vod somewhere.

7127
08:43:54,049 --> 08:43:57,049
He was good to me for a little while.

7128
08:43:57,049 --> 08:44:00,049
I screamed a lot, but he would be like, stop screaming.

7129
08:44:00,049 --> 08:44:02,049
And I'd be like, OK, jeez.

7130
08:44:02,049 --> 08:44:03,049
It hurts.

7131
08:44:03,049 --> 08:44:07,430
You turn the dryer on.

7132
08:44:07,430 --> 08:44:09,430
But thank you, Zazasoft, for the one dollar.

7133
08:44:09,430 --> 08:44:11,430
I don't have big bits or good joke to contribute.

7134
08:44:11,430 --> 08:44:13,430
I'm just looking forward to the future of the stream.

7135
08:44:13,430 --> 08:44:16,369
Don't worry about giving me huge amounts of money.

7136
08:44:16,369 --> 08:44:19,560
Your viewership is enough.

7137
08:44:19,560 --> 08:44:21,500
And I truly mean that.

7138
08:44:21,500 --> 08:44:24,500
So thank you, Zazasoft, for the one dollar.

7139
08:44:24,500 --> 08:44:28,250
And your body, your eyes here, right?

7140
08:44:28,250 --> 08:44:29,250
Like you're sitting there.

7141
08:44:29,250 --> 08:44:30,250
You're watching.

7142
08:44:30,250 --> 08:44:32,130
That's incredibly important.

7143
08:44:32,130 --> 08:44:33,819
It means a lot.

7144
08:44:33,819 --> 08:44:38,560
He was worried about the jokes.

7145
08:44:38,560 --> 08:44:39,560
Wait, what?

7146
08:44:39,560 --> 08:44:43,869
No, no.

7147
08:44:43,869 --> 08:44:44,869
Not your body.

7148
08:44:44,869 --> 08:44:45,869
No.

7149
08:44:45,869 --> 08:44:47,869
I mean like you sitting down.

7150
08:44:47,869 --> 08:44:51,090
Hey, Darkstar.

7151
08:44:51,090 --> 08:44:52,090
Thanks for the one dollar, Darkstar.

7152
08:44:52,090 --> 08:44:56,090
My siblings and I have a tradition of making silly short films every Christmas.

7153
08:44:56,090 --> 08:44:58,090
And this year we're planning on making a western.

7154
08:44:58,090 --> 08:45:05,090
This may seem random, but what would a good kryptonite for an army of a hundred grizzly bears be?

7155
08:45:05,090 --> 08:45:09,020
A steak.

7156
08:45:09,020 --> 08:45:12,959
Just like a pound of ground beef.

7157
08:45:12,959 --> 08:45:17,319
They would just go after it.

7158
08:45:17,319 --> 08:45:19,840
Honey?

7159
08:45:19,840 --> 08:45:20,840
No, honey.

7160
08:45:20,840 --> 08:45:21,840
That's Winnie the Pooh.

7161
08:45:21,840 --> 08:45:26,549
One pound of ground beef, and it'll be a fucking nightmare.

7162
08:45:26,549 --> 08:45:29,680
Rat poison?

7163
08:45:29,680 --> 08:45:31,950
Holy shit.

7164
08:45:31,950 --> 08:45:33,950
Thank you High Fire Spirit for the one dollar.

7165
08:45:33,950 --> 08:45:34,950
Neat.

7166
08:45:34,950 --> 08:45:37,020
I'm a sub now.

7167
08:45:37,020 --> 08:45:38,020
Welcome to the sub team.

7168
08:45:38,020 --> 08:45:42,200
We don't really have a team or anything, but welcome.

7169
08:45:42,200 --> 08:45:43,200
Regardless.

7170
08:45:43,200 --> 08:45:49,090
Where are we at here?

7171
08:45:49,090 --> 08:45:58,290
Getting to the end here.

7172
08:45:58,290 --> 08:46:00,290
Somebody said, carrot seven.

7173
08:46:00,290 --> 08:46:01,290
Thanks for the one dollar.

7174
08:46:01,290 --> 08:46:02,290
Shut up and watch.

7175
08:46:02,290 --> 08:46:03,290
This is your origin story.

7176
08:46:03,290 --> 08:46:13,069
What the hell is this?

7177
08:46:13,069 --> 08:46:14,069
I can't click it.

7178
08:46:14,069 --> 08:46:19,150
There we go.

7179
08:46:19,150 --> 08:46:22,150
Please join a movement of six million Americans to impeach Donald Trump.

7180
08:46:22,150 --> 08:46:24,150
This is not my origin story.

7181
08:46:24,150 --> 08:46:27,520
This is the most corrupt president.

7182
08:46:27,520 --> 08:46:29,520
This is not my origin story.

7183
08:46:29,520 --> 08:46:30,520
This is an ad.

7184
08:46:30,520 --> 08:46:32,520
Hold on.

7185
08:46:32,520 --> 08:46:35,520
Hello, everybody.

7186
08:46:35,520 --> 08:46:38,520
My name is Hill Joe Golem.

7187
08:46:38,520 --> 08:46:43,520
I'm Jeremy's grandfather.

7188
08:46:43,520 --> 08:46:47,520
And today we're going to play Insane Aquarium.

7189
08:46:47,520 --> 08:46:53,520
It's the best game you can ever buy.

7190
08:46:53,520 --> 08:46:56,520
This is my origin story.

7191
08:46:56,520 --> 08:46:58,520
I don't really play.

7192
08:46:58,520 --> 08:47:00,520
I just like bumped the keyboard.

7193
08:47:00,520 --> 08:47:03,520
Hello, everybody.

7194
08:47:03,520 --> 08:47:07,689
My name is your origin story.

7195
08:47:07,689 --> 08:47:08,689
Oh, like it.

7196
08:47:08,689 --> 08:47:09,689
Here's the link.

7197
08:47:09,689 --> 08:47:11,689
This is the fucking first grandpa video.

7198
08:47:11,689 --> 08:47:18,369
There you go.

7199
08:47:18,369 --> 08:47:20,369
Oh, my God.

7200
08:47:20,369 --> 08:47:33,189
My fucking head is in the video.

7201
08:47:33,189 --> 08:47:37,450
Hello, everybody.

7202
08:47:37,450 --> 08:47:38,450
Let's watch it.

7203
08:47:38,450 --> 08:47:39,450
Fine.

7204
08:47:39,450 --> 08:47:40,450
Fuck it.

7205
08:47:40,450 --> 08:47:43,450
Oh, we need to work together to impeach.

7206
08:47:43,450 --> 08:47:45,759
Hey, Jeremy, here's your origin story.

7207
08:47:45,759 --> 08:47:52,979
Oh, what in the name of God is this person talking about?

7208
08:47:52,979 --> 08:47:56,200
All right.

7209
08:47:56,200 --> 08:47:59,490
Let's watch it.

7210
08:47:59,490 --> 08:48:01,490
Hello, everybody.

7211
08:48:01,490 --> 08:48:05,919
My name is Hill Joe Golem.

7212
08:48:05,919 --> 08:48:09,919
I'm Jeremy's grandfather.

7213
08:48:09,919 --> 08:48:14,290
And today we're going to play Insane Aquarium.

7214
08:48:14,290 --> 08:48:16,290
The deluxe mode.

7215
08:48:16,290 --> 08:48:19,290
It's the best game you can ever buy.

7216
08:48:19,290 --> 08:48:21,659
And it's loading it right now.

7217
08:48:21,659 --> 08:48:24,659
Why are we picking up my first three videos I've ever made?

7218
08:48:24,659 --> 08:48:25,659
I don't really play video games.

7219
08:48:25,659 --> 08:48:27,659
They hurt my brain.

7220
08:48:27,659 --> 08:48:29,659
And I wish this noise.

7221
08:48:29,659 --> 08:48:31,659
We got to click here to play.

7222
08:48:31,659 --> 08:48:36,409
I play casual games because I'm an idiot.

7223
08:48:36,409 --> 08:48:39,409
I'm just.

7224
08:48:39,409 --> 08:48:42,409
OK, what am I doing here?

7225
08:48:42,409 --> 08:48:49,409
I want to do challenge mode because I know I want a new game.

7226
08:48:49,409 --> 08:48:50,409
New fucking game.

7227
08:48:50,409 --> 08:48:55,409
OK, let's try take number three because I still can't beat it.

7228
08:48:55,409 --> 08:48:59,409
I like to use the crab and I like to use the other crab.

7229
08:48:59,409 --> 08:49:01,409
And I like to use the floating crab.

7230
08:49:01,409 --> 08:49:05,409
Well, you know, to get the money in the beginning, you know.

7231
08:49:05,409 --> 08:49:07,409
OK, so it starts.

7232
08:49:07,409 --> 08:49:10,409
You click to feed these little fish face fucks.

7233
08:49:10,409 --> 08:49:14,409
And then, you know, they drop the dog shit.

7234
08:49:14,409 --> 08:49:16,409
And you click and you get money.

7235
08:49:16,409 --> 08:49:17,409
Two frames a second.

7236
08:49:17,409 --> 08:49:20,409
And you click again and you get more money.

7237
08:49:20,409 --> 08:49:25,409
And then my game is lagging really badly right now.

7238
08:49:25,409 --> 08:49:28,409
Click that money right there.

7239
08:49:28,409 --> 08:49:33,409
The whole point of this, by the way, folks, is you want to try and get as much money.

7240
08:49:33,409 --> 08:49:36,409
You can pay for your daughter's wedding.

7241
08:49:36,409 --> 08:49:40,409
At least that's what I pretend it is.

7242
08:49:40,409 --> 08:49:42,409
OK, so we got four fishes here.

7243
08:49:42,409 --> 08:49:45,409
Do you think people are going to watch it?

7244
08:49:45,409 --> 08:49:48,409
And I got my little friend Steve over here.

7245
08:49:48,409 --> 08:49:50,409
I think that's his name.

7246
08:49:50,409 --> 08:49:55,409
So the whole point is you want to give these guys delicious worm cakes.

7247
08:49:55,409 --> 08:49:57,409
And hold on a minute.

7248
08:49:57,409 --> 08:50:00,409
I have to diarrhea.

7249
08:50:00,409 --> 08:50:03,779
What?

7250
08:50:03,779 --> 08:50:04,779
OK.

7251
08:50:04,779 --> 08:50:05,779
OK.

7252
08:50:05,779 --> 08:50:08,779
I'm back from diarrhea.

7253
08:50:08,779 --> 08:50:14,779
I got a big fishy in diarrhea.

7254
08:50:14,779 --> 08:50:17,779
Oh, fuck.

7255
08:50:17,779 --> 08:50:19,779
Somebody fucking died.

7256
08:50:19,779 --> 08:50:20,779
And I got an alien.

7257
08:50:20,779 --> 08:50:21,779
Oh, this is bad.

7258
08:50:21,779 --> 08:50:24,779
You're going to shoot these fucking aliens.

7259
08:50:24,779 --> 08:50:27,040
Oh, my God.

7260
08:50:27,040 --> 08:50:30,040
Oh, Jesus Christ.

7261
08:50:30,040 --> 08:50:31,040
Don't worry, everybody.

7262
08:50:31,040 --> 08:50:34,040
I got a fucking diamond.

7263
08:50:34,040 --> 08:50:37,279
That means we can buy extra food.

7264
08:50:37,279 --> 08:50:40,279
$315.

7265
08:50:40,279 --> 08:50:41,279
Are you fucking kidding me?

7266
08:50:41,279 --> 08:50:43,279
$318 for food?

7267
08:50:43,279 --> 08:50:44,279
Do I lose?

7268
08:50:44,279 --> 08:50:48,290
Oh, you got to be shitting me.

7269
08:50:48,290 --> 08:50:50,290
Can you hear my dog?

7270
08:50:50,290 --> 08:50:52,290
So I'm doing pretty well here.

7271
08:50:52,290 --> 08:50:55,290
I got a big fish here.

7272
08:50:55,290 --> 08:50:56,290
Like I told you.

7273
08:50:56,290 --> 08:51:00,290
Like I told you before, I'm making lots of cash.

7274
08:51:00,290 --> 08:51:03,290
I'm going to upgrade my food quality.

7275
08:51:03,290 --> 08:51:04,290
Oh, shit.

7276
08:51:04,290 --> 08:51:05,290
Got to pick that up.

7277
08:51:05,290 --> 08:51:06,290
And the silver ones, too.

7278
08:51:06,290 --> 08:51:09,290
Remember, silver's worth something to him.

7279
08:51:09,290 --> 08:51:12,290
I don't know what this fucking face is for.

7280
08:51:12,290 --> 08:51:13,290
I don't know who the guppy is.

7281
08:51:13,290 --> 08:51:14,290
Guppy cruncher.

7282
08:51:14,290 --> 08:51:15,290
Oh, God.

7283
08:51:15,290 --> 08:51:19,290
Why did you think this was a good idea to upload?

7284
08:51:19,290 --> 08:51:20,290
I don't know.

7285
08:51:20,290 --> 08:51:23,900
What the fuck?

7286
08:51:23,900 --> 08:51:24,900
Just a second.

7287
08:51:24,900 --> 08:51:26,520
What is this?

7288
08:51:26,520 --> 08:51:31,020
This game is a bunch of bullshit.

7289
08:51:31,020 --> 08:51:32,840
Oh, my.

7290
08:51:33,840 --> 08:51:34,840
You got it.

7291
08:51:34,840 --> 08:51:35,840
Whatever.

7292
08:51:35,840 --> 08:51:38,840
You know, I'm returning this game.

7293
08:51:38,840 --> 08:51:41,840
I'm going to return this game today.

7294
08:51:41,840 --> 08:51:46,139
And oh, hello there, Suzy.

7295
08:51:46,139 --> 08:51:48,139
What's your name?

7296
08:51:48,139 --> 08:51:49,139
Never seen you.

7297
08:51:49,139 --> 08:51:52,139
What was I just saying about?

7298
08:51:52,139 --> 08:51:53,139
Oh, yeah.

7299
08:51:53,139 --> 08:51:59,139
I think I was saying I was going to play challenge mode.

7300
08:51:59,139 --> 08:52:05,139
And I need you to beat tank three, because I didn't beat tank three yet, OK?

7301
08:52:05,139 --> 08:52:10,139
I need to pick crab and other crab and this crab.

7302
08:52:10,139 --> 08:52:12,139
Do I do it again?

7303
08:52:12,139 --> 08:52:18,139
The point of this game is you want to feed these fishes and they collect the dog food.

7304
08:52:18,139 --> 08:52:20,139
Do I do the whole video again?

7305
08:52:20,139 --> 08:52:23,139
The whole point is you want to try and feed them.

7306
08:52:23,139 --> 08:52:28,139
And like I do, you've got to be careful because aliens come up.

7307
08:52:29,639 --> 08:52:32,200
What is it?

7308
08:52:32,200 --> 08:52:36,779
I'm playing a fucking video game.

7309
08:52:36,779 --> 08:52:39,560
I don't care.

7310
08:52:39,560 --> 08:52:41,560
You can go to hell.

7311
08:52:41,560 --> 08:52:44,970
OK.

7312
08:52:44,970 --> 08:52:46,970
I'll be up for dinner in a minute.

7313
08:52:46,970 --> 08:52:47,970
OK.

7314
08:52:51,599 --> 08:52:52,599
OK.

7315
08:52:52,599 --> 08:53:00,549
Like I was saying, oops, all of your fish have died.

7316
08:53:00,549 --> 08:53:10,599
Is that it?

7317
08:53:11,599 --> 08:53:15,599
You can hear the microphone.

7318
08:53:15,599 --> 08:53:22,279
You can hear the microphone get bumped.

7319
08:53:22,279 --> 08:53:23,279
What a shit video.

7320
08:53:23,279 --> 08:53:25,279
That was my third video I ever made.

7321
08:53:25,279 --> 08:53:27,279
I think I was testing.

7322
08:53:27,279 --> 08:53:30,720
Here's the story behind that video.

7323
08:53:30,720 --> 08:53:34,279
I was testing to see if fraps.

7324
08:53:34,279 --> 08:53:36,279
Remember the not DX story, not OBS.

7325
08:53:36,279 --> 08:53:41,189
Fraps could capture a game like that.

7326
08:53:41,189 --> 08:53:45,840
So just test.

7327
08:53:45,840 --> 08:53:50,919
Anyways, where were we here?

7328
08:53:50,919 --> 08:53:57,000
We were.

7329
08:53:57,000 --> 08:53:59,000
We reached me and beached.

7330
08:53:59,000 --> 08:54:02,240
That fucking, I really thought that's what you linked me.

7331
08:54:02,240 --> 08:54:03,240
And I was like, what?

7332
08:54:03,240 --> 08:54:04,240
Oh, my God.

7333
08:54:04,240 --> 08:54:06,240
That's so fucking funny.

7334
08:54:06,240 --> 08:54:07,610
Star killer.

7335
08:54:07,610 --> 08:54:09,610
Thank you, star killer, for the $1.

7336
08:54:09,610 --> 08:54:13,560
I made this video the night you left and people said to show it to you.

7337
08:54:13,560 --> 08:54:19,979
Let's see.

7338
08:54:19,979 --> 08:54:33,709
I'll stand in my way.

7339
08:54:33,709 --> 08:54:34,709
Here we go.

7340
08:54:34,709 --> 08:54:37,680
Let us see.

7341
08:54:37,680 --> 08:54:38,680
I'm holding away.

7342
08:54:38,680 --> 08:54:42,069
I've got to get it.

7343
08:54:42,069 --> 08:54:53,080
Is near.

7344
08:54:53,080 --> 08:54:58,840
And so I face hurting.

7345
08:54:58,840 --> 08:55:01,400
My friend.

7346
08:55:01,400 --> 08:55:03,889
I'll say it clear.

7347
08:55:03,889 --> 08:55:06,259
I'll state my case.

7348
08:55:06,259 --> 08:55:08,259
It's a lot of money.

7349
08:55:08,259 --> 08:55:10,259
Of which I'm certain.

7350
08:55:10,259 --> 08:55:16,040
I've lived it's full.

7351
08:55:16,040 --> 08:55:22,040
I've traveled each and every highway.

7352
08:55:22,040 --> 08:55:25,180
But more.

7353
08:55:25,180 --> 08:55:27,419
Much more than this.

7354
08:55:27,419 --> 08:55:37,209
I missed that keyboard.

7355
08:55:37,209 --> 08:55:43,549
It was a great keyboard.

7356
08:55:43,549 --> 08:55:45,549
Too few to mention.

7357
08:55:45,549 --> 08:55:51,180
What I had to do.

7358
08:55:51,180 --> 08:55:53,549
And saw it through.

7359
08:55:53,549 --> 08:55:57,919
Without exception.

7360
08:55:57,919 --> 08:56:02,840
Each charted course.

7361
08:56:02,840 --> 08:56:04,840
Each careful step.

7362
08:56:04,840 --> 08:56:06,840
Belong.

7363
08:56:06,840 --> 08:56:12,860
What the fuck was I doing?

7364
08:56:12,860 --> 08:56:17,520
This is my.

7365
08:56:17,520 --> 08:56:27,790
As they'll show you.

7366
08:56:27,790 --> 08:56:29,790
When I beat off.

7367
08:56:29,790 --> 08:56:33,869
Kachoo.

7368
08:56:33,869 --> 08:56:35,869
Alright this is the video's end here.

7369
08:56:35,869 --> 08:56:39,259
Because that was.

7370
08:56:39,259 --> 08:56:50,200
Oh I got it.

7371
08:56:50,200 --> 08:56:52,200
Hahaha.

7372
08:56:52,200 --> 08:57:49,099
That was great.

7373
08:57:49,099 --> 08:57:52,110
Thank you Starkiller2010.

7374
08:57:52,110 --> 08:57:54,599
For that wonderful video.

7375
08:57:54,599 --> 08:58:00,409
Thank you.

7376
08:58:00,409 --> 08:58:02,650
Goodbye old house.

7377
08:58:02,650 --> 08:58:05,919
Goodbye old Massachusetts.

7378
08:58:05,919 --> 08:58:13,720
Welcome to Las Vegas.

7379
08:58:13,720 --> 08:58:15,720
Oh is your twitch just frozen?

7380
08:58:15,720 --> 08:58:18,479
It shouldn't be.

7381
08:58:18,479 --> 08:58:23,150
Give us a link.

7382
08:58:23,150 --> 08:58:25,150
Here is the link to that video.

7383
08:58:25,150 --> 08:58:27,639
I'm leaving Las Vegas.

7384
08:58:27,639 --> 08:58:29,639
That's true.

7385
08:58:29,639 --> 08:58:31,639
Thank you to Darkstar for the $1.

7386
08:58:31,639 --> 08:58:33,639
I think it's time to put your best baby voice.

7387
08:58:33,639 --> 08:58:35,639
And do an AFV style stream for your old YouTube videos.

7388
08:58:35,639 --> 08:58:37,639
Not for a while.

7389
08:58:37,639 --> 08:58:39,639
Maybe someday.

7390
08:58:39,639 --> 08:58:41,639
Butterderp thanks to the $1 for your information.

7391
08:58:41,639 --> 08:58:44,119
I wanted to make sure that it was me.

7392
08:58:44,119 --> 08:58:46,119
Who recommended you play The Sims 4.

7393
08:58:46,119 --> 08:58:48,119
Should I play The Sims? It was me.

7394
08:58:48,119 --> 08:58:52,909
Me. Me.

7395
08:58:52,909 --> 08:58:54,909
Well thank you Butterderp. That was a lot of fun.

7396
08:58:54,909 --> 08:58:56,909
The streams were great.

7397
08:58:56,909 --> 08:58:59,080
Tora T. Tora T. Thanks for the $1. They say seems good.

7398
08:58:59,080 --> 08:59:01,080
Tora gave an absolute

7399
08:59:01,080 --> 08:59:03,709
shitload of community subs.

7400
08:59:03,709 --> 08:59:07,159
Thank you so much Tora.

7401
08:59:07,159 --> 08:59:09,849
You gave a huge amount.

7402
08:59:09,849 --> 08:59:14,700
So thank you.

7403
08:59:14,700 --> 08:59:18,349
It was a crazy, crazy, crazy fucking amount.

7404
08:59:18,349 --> 08:59:21,099
Thank you. So much.

7405
08:59:21,099 --> 08:59:24,240
Dr. Clay thank you for the $1.

7406
08:59:24,240 --> 08:59:26,240
Do you think every time you pick up auto you're playing

7407
08:59:26,240 --> 08:59:28,409
grab that auto.

7408
08:59:28,409 --> 08:59:30,409
Well grab that auto not grab that auto.

7409
08:59:30,409 --> 08:59:32,650
Different words. Different scenarios.

7410
08:59:32,650 --> 08:59:34,650
Wrong screen bud.

7411
08:59:34,650 --> 08:59:36,650
Wrong screen bud.

7412
08:59:36,650 --> 08:59:44,250
There it is.

7413
08:59:44,250 --> 08:59:46,250
Thank you bet3 for the $10.

7414
08:59:46,250 --> 08:59:49,450
Thanks for everything Jerma. We all appreciate you so much.

7415
08:59:49,450 --> 08:59:51,450
Thank you bet3 for your massive contributions.

7416
08:59:51,450 --> 08:59:55,529
Thank you guys.

7417
08:59:55,529 --> 08:59:57,840
Deva Kitty thanks for the $1.

7418
08:59:57,840 --> 08:59:59,840
I just remembered you made a Nidhogg video

7419
08:59:59,840 --> 09:00:02,200
years ago where you played the game

7420
09:00:02,200 --> 09:00:04,200
and me and my girlfriend have had a lot of

7421
09:00:04,200 --> 09:00:06,200
frantic fun playing the sequel.

7422
09:00:06,200 --> 09:00:08,200
So I can very much recommend you play it

7423
09:00:08,200 --> 09:00:10,200
with someone like Italics

7424
09:00:10,200 --> 09:00:12,200
or indeed in the spirit of

7425
09:00:12,200 --> 09:00:14,200
Lethal League reunion with Star.

7426
09:00:14,200 --> 09:00:16,830
Me and Star did play Lethal League and

7427
09:00:16,830 --> 09:00:19,520
Nidhogg 2 does exist.

7428
09:00:19,520 --> 09:00:23,020
It's true. Give it a look.

7429
09:00:23,020 --> 09:00:26,330
Thank you. Thank you

7430
09:00:26,330 --> 09:00:28,330

7431
09:00:28,330 --> 09:00:30,330
for the $1. I just remembered you made a Nidhogg

7432
09:00:30,330 --> 09:00:32,330
video. Wrong.

7433
09:00:32,330 --> 09:00:34,330
Wrong. Hey Jerma

7434
09:00:34,330 --> 09:00:36,330

7435
09:00:36,330 --> 09:00:38,330
Habba Dabba Dabba Dabba

7436
09:00:38,330 --> 09:00:40,330

7437
09:00:40,330 --> 09:00:42,330
just letting you know how cool this stream today was

7438
09:00:42,330 --> 09:00:44,330
to love, laugh, and live.

7439
09:00:44,330 --> 09:00:48,860
Fuck is happening.

7440
09:00:48,860 --> 09:00:50,860
You're a sex god or something.

7441
09:00:50,860 --> 09:00:53,549
What? What? What?

7442
09:00:53,549 --> 09:00:55,849
Thank you Synthesis Pandabot for the

7443
09:00:55,849 --> 09:00:58,220

Synthesis Pandabot for the $1 again.

7445
09:01:00,220 --> 09:01:02,220
It's me Jerma Guy at Jerma95

7446
09:01:02,220 --> 09:01:04,520
I'm here to tell you you'll

7447
09:01:04,520 --> 09:01:06,520
shoot your eye out kid.

7448
09:01:06,520 --> 09:01:09,340
Sans Undertale. Have a good night

7449
09:01:09,340 --> 09:01:13,049
funny man. And I'm the

7450
09:01:13,049 --> 09:01:21,310
drunk one. Who is this crazy guy?

7451
09:01:21,310 --> 09:01:23,479
Thank you Pandabot.

7452
09:01:23,479 --> 09:01:26,299
Double D thanks for the $1. Hey Jerma

7453
09:01:26,299 --> 09:01:28,729
I've been watching this stream in the hospital. You've been keeping

7454
09:01:28,729 --> 09:01:30,729
me happy during this hard time. Don't worry

7455
09:01:30,729 --> 09:01:32,729
I'm fine. Just had a small incident when I tripped

7456
09:01:32,729 --> 09:01:34,729
and I fell into my walk-in oven

7457
09:01:34,729 --> 09:01:36,729
and got locked in for an undetermined

7458
09:01:36,729 --> 09:01:38,729
amount of minutes. Okay.

7459
09:01:38,729 --> 09:01:40,729
Thanks for the $2. Oop, misspelled Jerma Heart

7460
09:01:40,729 --> 09:01:42,729
in the last bit. Hope that didn't confuse you.

7461
09:01:42,729 --> 09:01:45,340
Thanks for the

7462
09:01:45,340 --> 09:01:47,340
$2 though dude. Synthesis

7463
09:01:47,340 --> 09:01:49,340
Pandabot again for the $1.

7464
09:01:49,340 --> 09:01:51,840
I want to hear a secret. I don't

7465
09:01:51,840 --> 09:01:53,840
exist. I don't really exist.

7466
09:01:53,840 --> 09:01:56,840
Well Synthesis Pandabot

7467
09:01:56,840 --> 09:02:00,110
you do exist. Cause somebody

7468
09:02:00,110 --> 09:02:02,110
had to write that so it was you. It had

7469
09:02:02,110 --> 09:02:04,110
to have been. Who else could it have been?

7470
09:02:04,110 --> 09:02:06,540
Synthesis Pandabot

7471
09:02:06,540 --> 09:02:08,540

7472
09:02:08,540 --> 09:02:10,540

09:02:46,840 --> 09:02:48,840
my computer's turning off. Is my computer turning off?

7491
09:02:48,840 --> 09:02:51,599
No I'm good.

7492
09:02:51,599 --> 09:02:53,599
The front monitor turned off. That was weird.

7493
09:02:53,599 --> 09:02:56,029
Anyways happy to join in the last few minutes

7494
09:02:56,029 --> 09:02:58,029

09:03:20,729 --> 09:03:25,709
Un-fucking-believable.

09:03:25,709 --> 09:03:27,709
There had to have been 600 subs

09:03:27,709 --> 09:03:34,169

7507
09:03:34,169 --> 09:03:37,240

do you want auto?

7523
09:04:12,220 --> 09:04:14,400
He's been out, he's eaten. I think he's just bored.

7524
09:04:14,400 --> 09:04:19,000
Big stream delay.

7525
09:04:19,000 --> 09:04:22,520
Yeah, hi from the east coast.

7526
09:04:22,520 --> 09:04:24,520
I never streamed till

7527
09:04:24,520 --> 09:04:29,520
3am, 4am before.

7528
09:04:29,520 --> 09:04:31,520
I don't even know how many subs there were.

7529
09:04:31,520 --> 09:04:34,909
Let me look at a thing here.

7530
09:04:34,909 --> 09:04:36,909
This is just crazy. Yeah.

7531
09:04:36,909 --> 09:04:41,180

7532
09:04:41,180 --> 09:04:43,869
2, 3.

7533
09:04:43,869 --> 09:04:45,869
Yeah, it was somewhere around 500 or 600 subscriptions

7534
09:04:45,869 --> 09:04:49,840
tonight. That's

7535
09:04:49,840 --> 09:04:55,340
crazy. What time did the

7536
09:04:55,340 --> 09:04:57,340
10 hour monster rancher 2 end?

7537
09:04:57,340 --> 09:04:59,580
I don't think it was 3 o'clock in the morning.

7538
09:04:59,580 --> 09:05:05,340
500 subs

7539
09:05:05,340 --> 09:05:08,029

7540
09:05:08,029 --> 09:05:10,029
much in bits.

7541
09:05:10,029 --> 09:05:12,029
Thousands of dollars. Thousands of dollars

7542
09:05:12,029 --> 09:05:14,459
tonight. Thousands.

7543
09:05:14,459 --> 09:05:18,560
I can't even fucking comprehend it.

7544
09:05:18,560 --> 09:05:21,680
That's, thank

7545
09:05:21,680 --> 09:05:28,970

7546
09:05:28,970 --> 09:05:31,209
my gratitude so thank you.

7547
09:05:31,209 --> 09:05:34,479
Yeah, I guess

7548
09:05:34,479 --> 09:05:36,479
I'll buy a Vive, you know.

7549
09:05:36,479 --> 09:05:42,619
I'm from Serbia.

7550
09:05:42,619 --> 09:05:44,619
Hello, it's 9am. Well, good morning

7551
09:05:44,619 --> 09:05:49,290

7552
09:05:49,290 --> 09:05:51,290
bits that came in. Burgaby with one

7553
09:05:51,290 --> 09:05:54,560
dollar. They said I hate you.

7554
09:05:54,560 --> 09:05:56,560
I respect your opinion. I'm just

7555
09:05:56,560 --> 09:05:58,560
sad that that's what it is.

7556
09:05:58,560 --> 09:06:00,560
Thank you.

7557
09:06:00,560 --> 09:06:02,560
Double D, thanks for the one dollar. Double D

Hopefully pretty good. But I

09:06:11,879 --> 09:06:14,250
had a lot of fun tonight. See you guys in

7561
09:06:14,250 --> 09:06:17,519

7562
09:06:17,519 --> 09:06:19,519
500 fucking hundred subscriptions.

7563
09:06:19,519 --> 09:06:23,019
My god.

7564
09:06:23,019 --> 09:06:25,319
Good night. Good luck to you all.

09:06:25,319 --> 09:06:27,319
See you Tuesday.

7566
09:06:27,319 --> 09:06:29,319
Get some rest. Enjoy the rest

7567
09:06:29,319 --> 09:06:32,010
