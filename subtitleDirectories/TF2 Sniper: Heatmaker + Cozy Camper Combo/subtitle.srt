00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,699
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Sniper with the Heatman's Hitmaker.

2
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:27,940
What the Hitman's Heatmaker? Why did I mess that up? And the Cozy Camper and the Shahanshah.

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,939
So what I want to talk about in this video, I want to talk about this combination right here, the Heatmaker and the Cozy Camper.

4
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:39,939
It is an incredible setup, and I'll go into why I use it, why I think it's good, and that sort of thing.

5
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:47,179
First and foremost, I want to talk about the Cozy Camper buff, and what it means to snipers everywhere. It's a very good thing.

6
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:54,350
So if you missed my video from a week ago, or if you missed the buff in general, the Cozy Camper now regenerates 1 health every second.

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,350
Now it may seem like it's doing 2 health a second, but if you really do the counting, it's just giving you 2 health in 2 seconds.

8
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,349
So if you look in the lower left and you're like, wait, why does it say 2? That's the reason why.

9
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,530
Now the question you might be having is, Jerma, why do you like this thing so much now? And here is the number 1 reason.

10
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,700
As a Sniper, you pretty much, well as a Scope Sniper, let me rephrase that, you stay back and you stand still.

11
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,700
You move around maybe a little bit, you go to a different spot, you'll hang out over there, hang out over there.

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
But for the most part, you are standing kind of still shooting your Sniper rifle.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,700
This allows you to heal for a medium health pack in 60 seconds.

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Or 63 to be exact, because a medium health pack does 63 health for a Sniper. That doesn't have the Darwin's Danger Shield.

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,939
So let's go back to what I was talking about.

16
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,939
If you are standing still as a Sniper, and you don't want to move, and you're confident that you're not going to get shot at,

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:52,939
you don't have to go looking for a health pack anymore. You don't have to go scouring the map looking for a medium health or a small health pack.

18
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,939
Especially if you're above 50% health, you will heal that back in like 20 to 30 seconds.

19
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,939
That's not that much time if you really think about it.

20
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,939
Also, I didn't even think about this until I put it on and got sprayed by a Pyro.

21
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,939
This is the anti-afterburn.

22
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:13,939
There's been at least a few cases since the update launched where I've been lit on fire and should have died,

23
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,939
but I had the Cozy Camper on and it negated a lot of the afterburn.

24
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,939
So that alone is reason to put this thing on.

25
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:26,310
So now I want to talk about the Heatmaker and the Cozy Camper and why they are a match made in heaven.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,550
So as we all know, the Heatmaker uses the new mechanic of focus.

27
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,550
When you shoot somebody with a full focus bar, it's going to start to drain the bar and you can stay scoped in.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,550
Now think of the Camper.

29
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,550
The Camper allows you to not flinch when you are shot and reduces knockback to your character.

30
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,550
Now imagine this.

31
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,550
You get into focus and you are uninterruptible by anything besides maybe a compression blast.

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,550
This whole time, you are scoped in and don't have to scope back out.

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,550
This allows you to only rely on your aim and nothing else.

34
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,550
You're not going to be knocked back. You're not going to be flinched.

35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,550
You're not going to have to reload, come back, zoom back in.

36
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,550
It's just a game of how many people in the head you can shoot.

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,550
It's ridiculous.

38
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,789
Now you aren't totally invincible. In fact, you're very vulnerable because spies can take you down.

39
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,789
Of course, scouts. I mean, you've already seen a scout kill me from behind already.

40
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:23,789
So you're not invincible, but it really helps with your aim and really helps with your concentration.

41
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,789
You just need to hope that your other teammates are keeping people away from you.

42
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:33,159
And if you want my thoughts on the Heatmaker, my general impressions on this weapon and what I think about it,

43
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,159
I think this is the best sniper rifle in the game right now.

44
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,159
I actually never really liked the Makina because of the no-no scope.

45
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,159
I couldn't get over that because I would be in so many situations where I'd want to no-scope somebody I wouldn't be able to.

46
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,400
And the only downside to the Heatmaker is just the minus 20% damage to body shots.

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
That's a pretty big downside, but at the same time, you've got to remember,

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
most snipers are going to be aiming for your face, not for your chest.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,400
And it does the same amount of damage as any of the other sniper rifles, except, of course, the Makina fully charged.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
So it's, I mean, the body shot thing is not that big of a deal.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,580
If you want to balance this weapon a little bit, or if you would think about a nerf for this weapon,

52
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,580
in my opinion, take away the 25% faster charging.

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,579
Because what that does, that makes it better than the Bazaar Bargain.

54
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,579
That does what the Bazaar Bargain is supposed to do.

55
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:28,579
I think if you get rid of that and you make the damage penalty on body shots a little bit higher, maybe 25% or 30%,

56
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,579
I think then you have a very good sniper rifle that's balanced with all the other ones.

57
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,879
We'll see what Valve does.

58
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,879
They're always changing things. They're always making little tweaks to the items.

59
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,879
We shall see.

60
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,250
But in the meantime, that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,250
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,250
And also, I want to bring this up.

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,250
Yesterday, my Facecam Fortress 2 video, I don't think made it all the way through publishing and got to everybody's sub boxes,

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,250
because I had at least a few people tell me, I didn't even see this. What the hell?

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,420
So if you missed it, it's going to be in the description.

66
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,420
The link will be there to yesterday. It is a Facecam Fortress 2 video.

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,420
And I do apologize, guys, because YouTube is always screwing things up with the sub boxes.

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,420
And if you've been missing videos, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about it.

69
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
And I wish there was something I could do.

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,600
But whenever it's very evident that a video has not gone all the way through publishing,

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I will just put an announcement on the tail end of another video like this,

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,779
just letting you guys know in case you happen to miss it.

73
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,949
But again, thanks for watching. That's going to be it.

74
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,949
And I'll see you guys all next time.

75
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,949
So take care, everybody.
