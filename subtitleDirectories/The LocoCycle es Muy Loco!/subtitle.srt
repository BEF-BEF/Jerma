00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,000
Is that... is that Freddy Rodriguez? That's Freddy Rodriguez! What the hell is going on?

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:32,390
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa easy. That's dangerous. Oh shit, he's gonna hatch it. He's gonna hatch it.

3
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,630
Suplex.

4
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,670
That was... that was awesome. I ain't gonna lie. You can't deny that suplexing somebody off a

5
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,850
motorcycle isn't pretty damn cool, okay? Just get these guys out of the way. Get out of my face.

6
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:05,099
A couple more pieces of health. Nice. Whoa, there's another one up here. If I can get through one a

7
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:13,290
minute, then I should be fine. Did you see that burger? That was a ridiculous looking burger on

8
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,480
that billboard. It was like six patties on that hamburger. That was insane. Now I want a hamburger.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:32,310
Great. What the fuck just happened? What? I don't know what... I don't know what happened.

10
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:41,579
The thing just freaked out and flew off the cliff. Move, move, move, move. I only have 54 seconds.

11
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:52,019
I only have 54 seconds. Get me up there. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

12
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:04,620
It did it again. It didn't... why is it doing that? Why is it doing that?

13
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:12,169
What? I'm gonna fail the mission. No, no, I'm back. He's back. You see that? He just teleported from

14
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,770
the right side of the screen. Wow, that was really stupid. I hope you guys got to see that.

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:32,969
That was unbelievable. Thank God, dude. That was ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous,

16
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:40,650
the car just got sucked up by a spaceship. They put a tractor beam on that fucking thing.

17
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:52,300
I got an F. Fuck you with the F. Maybe if your stupid trucks weren't driving off the side of the

18
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,099
road, I wouldn't have to restart the thing three or four goddamn times. You wanna talk about a quick

19
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,099
time? You wanna talk about a quick time? You wanna talk about quick time? Press A, quick time. Press

20
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,900
B, looking for the quick time. Come out at your quick time. Helicopter, don't worry, quick time.

21
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,460
Gonna turn right, looking for the quick time. I ain't seeing more, right? Quick time. Helicopter,

22
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,259
quick time. Come back, quick time. What you wanna do? Wanna go, quick time. Wanna find a way,

23
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,419
do some quick time. Ain't no other way for that quick time. Coming at you, quick time.

24
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:42,580
Oh, road rash. Whoa. What the hell? Oh, damn. Are we really watching this?

25
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:51,060
Coming soon to theaters. Cars 3, colon. Motorcycles, a love story. Rated X.

26
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:04,069
Dude, this guy is just on a rampage right now. Are you serious? What a dick. These innocent people

27
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,939
did nothing wrong and you just caused like a seven car pileup. Just for what? Because you're mad at

28
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:17,449
her for like being like too pretty or something? Like what's your problem? And now you just blew

29
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,370
up a perfectly good oil tanker. That company's gonna lose out on thousands of dollars.

30
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:36,120
I know this trick. What, you think I'm stupid? You don't think I've never seen

31
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,699
homing missiles shot at me before? Your buddies have been doing this all game

32
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,430
and look what happened. All your secret agent buddies have been shooting homing,

33
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,750
slow homing missiles at me and look where it got them. You probably should have taken a note

34
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,149
about that before you came after Marie. Marie. You probably should have taken a note before you

35
00:04:54,149 --> 00:05:04,009
came after Marie. Oh, I'm on fire mode. On fire mode. Ooh, counter attack. Hello, sweetheart.

36
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:10,870
What's going on, Master Chief? You're in the wrong game, Master Chief. Don't you know you

37
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,589
can't fuck with the Batmobile game thing with the flaming wheels from Disney Pixar?

38
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,519
Master Chief and your buddy Boba Fett Chief, you're all a bunch of fucking clowns.

39
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,240
Halo 5 ain't even coming out this year. Haven't you read the fucking news?

40
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,579
Halo 5 ain't gonna be out for like another 10 years. We got the Power Rangers behind us.

41
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:45,899
We got, who's the Red Power Ranger? Tommy? And the Green Ranger? No, the Green Ranger was Tommy.

42
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:53,430
And the Red was, what was the Red Power Ranger's name? I don't remember. Henry? All right, well

43
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:01,980
Henry's dead. Tommy, well, all the Tommy clones are dead now. Hopefully they don't morph into like

44
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,459
Pterodactyls and T-Rexes and shit. One Power Ranger had a terrible, terrible transformation.

45
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,220
Do you remember in the Power Rangers movie, the one Power Ranger that had the frog

46
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:20,839
and he was pissed? I'd be pissed too. If my power, you know, T-Rex, Pterodactyl, Tiger, Lion, Frog.

47
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:30,019
Yeah, that would suck. I want to be the Tiger. I don't want to be a frog. What am I talking about?
