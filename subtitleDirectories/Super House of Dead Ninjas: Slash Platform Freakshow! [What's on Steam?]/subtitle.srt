00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:16,180
you can do like kind of a link attack like zelda when you go down on people uh not go down uh

10
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,699
there's the germo there you go again like saying like innuendo is when you don't mean to

18
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,090
those of you watching right now if you want to play this game i highly suggest you plug in a

so i get a speed through this come on time yeah i just took a lot of damage right there so

25
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,879
