1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,470
I'm so sudden, somebody said. So sudden. What do you mean sudden? I've got a time frame.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:18,120
And I'm here. I could show up at one o'clock. I could show up at 1.59. Or two. Or 2.15. Carrying

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,350
a bunch of fucking grocery bags. I might, yeah, I may have been late, but I've got groceries. I was

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:31,379
at the grocery store and I have all the groceries. Six or seven bags on each hand. Because I don't

5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:38,549
know about you guys. I don't do multiple trips going back and forth from the car. You do all of

6
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:44,140
it. So you only have to do it once. Sure, it hurts a little and it's a little bit of pain,

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:01:02,740
but you get everything done. I'm so proud of that. One and done. Yeah, exactly. 700,000 bags of milk.

8
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:13,260
But hello, I've returned. I was back from TwitchCon a day or two ago, but didn't stream.

9
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:22,310
Had some other stuff to take care of. But we're back. For good. Not that we were gone for good

10
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,590
either. I saw people in the pre-stream chat. They said, you've got to tell us some stories.

11
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:42,019
Okay. You ready for some wild TwitchCon stories? How about this one? Whoa. So at the TwitchCon party.

12
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:50,140
Wow. Huge concert. People fucking partying in the front on the field. It was at Petco parks. It was

13
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:58,439
a huge thing. I sat behind home plate where there was nobody there. Me and like five or six people.

14
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,180
We just watched from like a mile away. Just kind of sitting there enjoying the concert.

15
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,449
No, somebody said people watching. No, we essentially were doing a helicopter tour.

16
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:26,550
That's how far away we were. Just sitting there. It was kind of nice. Did I have a toothpick? Yes,

17
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,539
I did. At some point. And I'm sure there's going to be lots of pictures that people have.

18
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,699
Yeah. This one in the chat. Yeah. That's what people are saying. How do you react to,

19
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:46,139
how you can react to in gigantic quotes? Look, I squished Jerma in Photoshop.

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:57,180
Let me see. How do we react to this? What the fuck? The fuck did you do to me? I'm not that small.

21
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:10,439
Is that what you wanted? This one isn't even trying. Look at the, look at the ceiling. They

22
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,599
actually just took the crop tool, grabbed from the top of the picture and then squished it down and

23
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:26,250
then stretched it. That was not even trying. What about the stain on my pants? Yeah. I saw the one

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,689
with somebody. I saw the piss one, the, the way somebody made it look like I pissed my pants.

25
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,939
You got, you guys are some, there's just so, there's so many fake pictures out there.

26
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,740
I don't even know which one is the real one. You know what I mean? When you, when you, okay,

27
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,659
when you take a picture and it gets circulated a million times and it's edited a million times

28
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,180
and you show one of those, you show them edit number 600,241, that person probably thinks

29
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:10,150
that edit is real. A case of point, somebody put a text on my shirt in one of those posts.

30
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,150
I didn't have text on my shirt and somebody said, why the fuck is he wearing that shirt?

31
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:23,540
It's like, I, I wasn't wearing that shirt is exactly what happened. Dude, what the, what,

32
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:34,939
what happened? Why did he piss his pants? No. No. How do we combat fake data is what I want to know

33
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:42,149
because it's all fun and games. It's all fun and games until it starts like world war three.

34
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:56,420
This is the future. Yeah. But no, TwitchCon was awesome. I had a great time. Met a lot

35
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:06,300
of people. It was fantastic. Lots of new stuff coming out of TwitchCon. Uh, the next projects

36
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,939
project is already being worked on and it always isn't going to be good this time.

37
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,779
I ain't going to give you any details, but just know that somewhere in, um,

38
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,339
somewhere in December, January ish, uh, you're going to get something else. And it's going to

39
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:27,379
be pretty fucking cool. That's all I've got to say. Cool. All right. Today we are going to play

40
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,839
Hitman Tuesday. I'll say we got caught off last time last week, so I'm going to play it.

41
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:41,300
We have to finish one of the missions. Uh, there's one more area and then I kind of,

42
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:53,500
I want to go back and do the first area again. It's untitled goose game. Community stream when

43
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,939
right? Okay. I said I was going to talk about that too. I will probably do the community stream.

44
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm going to go three days in a row. So we're going to do today is going to be hitman tomorrow.

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,899
Something weird. Uh, something that I don't, I might, I might have to change games within

46
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,899
10 seconds or I'll be addicted for 10 hours. I don't know. I just know that it exists and I'm

47
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:17,180
going to try it. Uh, and then Friday, I'm going to try to compile all those images and all those

48
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,139
things for the community night on Friday. So the end of this week, that sounds like plan to me.

49
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:34,019
Oh, should I go to work? Well, I did say that I was going to do it right. Like kind of right

50
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,860
after TwitchCon, I was going to, we were going to do it. So I mean, TwitchCon was this last weekend,

51
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,100
but let's get started. Don't waste any more time. Let's play the second area and hitman two and

52
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:56,819
let's just enjoy hitman too. I mean, let's enjoy it because this is, this is probably going to be

53
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:04,310
the last time that I play this game. I can't imagine going back to doing more hitman too.

54
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:12,069
So let's get all we want out of it today. How's that sound? This one's called the last resort.

55
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:34,980
Why is everybody doing the D phase? I don't get it. Oh, it's because it's the, by the way,

56
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,500
all my other monitor is just that image of me. Like, and here's the thing about like,

57
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,579
here's the thing about like the fake. I can't even talk about a problem. I will in a minute.

58
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,839
I'm like spouting off about fake media, but it's true though. It's

59
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,800
actual fake media that's supposed to be presented as real.

60
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,740
out of the Maldives. It's true. It's fake. To the public, they specialize in reputation management

61
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,579
for the rich and famous. The real money, however, comes from the covert reconstruction of identities

62
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:37,340
for wealthy criminals. They make people disappear. The partners are using Haven to acquire new

63
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,779
identities. Yes, it's true that it's fake. This is going to get real weird in 10 years.

64
00:08:46,679 --> 00:09:00,840
The access keys every 10 hours. That unfortunately makes them targets. It's called Haven is a true

65
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,320
tropical paradise owned by the company's founder, Tyson Williams. The island is used by Haven as

66
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,000
a combined headquarters and client entertainment center. Current and potential clients are ferried

67
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,120
to the island and treated to the very best. Do I get to drive a boat? I hope I can drive a boat.

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,120
That's the first thing I'm going to try. I don't care about anything else.

69
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,009
Boat client. You want a boat.

70
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,370
And he loves the water. He loves boats.

71
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:59,450
CEO of Haven. This guy, a former confidence artist hired by Williams to serve as a client

72
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,370
recruiter in hand. Okay. And Stephen Bradley, technical wizard and the brains behind Haven's

73
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,330
proprietary software. The owner's gone. Olivia will be able to penetrate the Haven servers long

74
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:19,289
enough for her to secure the new part. I've uploaded all the information we have on the

75
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:30,179
island and the three targets. Best of luck, gentlemen. Well, good luck. I don't do shit.

76
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,409
I just send you off and stand over here till you're done. But I'm a very, very,

77
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:47,799
I'm very good at assassinating people too. Where's the multiplayer? Come on,

78
00:10:47,799 --> 00:11:06,899
with co-op for this mission. DLC co-op with that guy. All right. So we've got Jesus. Okay. So we

79
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:21,080
got Tyson Williams, Stephen Bradley, and Ludmila Vitrova. Let's go to the planning stage. Resort.

80
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,799
Okay. Coins. I was going to take a few coins. I would prefer apples, but I don't know. They're

81
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,600
not available. They better be available in this mission or I'll be very upset.

82
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,450
This guy's wearing welding glasses. Okay. Good to know. I think we're good. No, wait, wait, wait,

83
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,929
wait, wait. I got something better than this, right? Yeah. Looks good. All right. I'm ready.

84
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:52,870
And play unprofessional. We just got big bits just came in. Freddie Dredd just gave 5,000 bits.

85
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,470
Thank you, Freddie Dredd. I don't know how to use Twitch, but I love you,

86
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:06,409
Jerma. Made this account for you. Well, thank you, Freddie Dredd, that you figured it out.

87
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,809
I think you got it working. Welcome to the Maldives.

88
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:21,289
Appreciate that though. That's a lot of money. Thank you, Freddie Dredd. Made this account from

89
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,769
me. It's ready to receive you under your assumed identity as Tobias Reaper,

90
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:31,370
a professional thief looking to retire from a life of crime. Freddie Dredd watches Jerma.

91
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,490
Ludmilla Vetrova can be found in the public section of the island, primarily tending to

92
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,929
client needs. Is this some kind of currency thing? Steven Bradley alternates between looking after

93
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:46,570
a strict training regimen. I also made this account for you. How many of you guys made your

94
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,169
account last night? While Tyson Williams roams his large villa estate at the back of the island.

95
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,500
Why did you just put on extra glasses? Eliminating the three owners of Haven

96
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,580
should buy Miss Hall the time needed to do a full penetration and retrieval

97
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,700
of the Providence partner. Providence partner data is what I need.

98
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:17,220
I told I get to drive a boat. I knew it. I didn't, but he did. Jealous. Jealous.

99
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:40,809
Damn it. Okay. Did I take the bag? All right. I got to, okay, hold on. God damn it. I wish I

100
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:51,500
could fly one of those. All right. So we just get up here. This is a nice place. A little chunky.

101
00:13:51,500 --> 00:14:02,460
It's a little chunky right now because my computer sucks. I need like a 2080.

102
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,899
I thought that guy was pissing. All right. So we have to look for some intel.

103
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,929
Let me look at the map. So we write what there's one right here.

104
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,429
Easy. I need to get a better computer. I know I do.

105
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,419
Is this open? No. Anything in there? I don't know. All right. Let's go to the welcome center.

106
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,860
I think the welcome center is over here. Let's go through the front door.

107
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:44,389
My shadow is messed up. Yeah. Well, that's what a 1080 gets you.

108
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,269
Okay. Key to the private hut. Welcome to Haven. Let's do it. What do you guys got for me?

109
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:11,299
Personal message. All right. Can I get a candy? No, I can't take a peppermint.

110
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:20,870
So the key to your personal hut. Where the hell is my, where is it? I hate when hotels do this

111
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:27,340
shit. They just hand you your key. They don't even tell you where the elevator is. Here you go, Mr.

112
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,679
Albertson. Have a nice day. You're on like the 54th floor. You don't know. I don't know where the

113
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:39,639
fuck to go. Did she tell me? She told me. What did she say? Hold on. She said it?

114
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:53,750
Hut on the left? Hold on. Wait. Did she actually say it? He just wanted to talk shit. Wait. I don't

115
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,620
care about that. We don't go right to your hotel room. Anyway, you go to the bar first. This is

116
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:27,779
water. This is cool. I was too invested in the candy. Oh my God. Are these pretzels? Okay.

117
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:38,730
Selling off. Wait. Oh, you two aren't talking.

118
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,259
I'm just eavesdropping on the wrong people. Okay, you're selling it. All right.

119
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:02,059
It seems Ms. Ventrova is trying to get Jason Portman out of his hut and she has ordered a

120
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,220
member of staff to watch him. According to his entourage, he's planning on selling his shares in

121
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:29,660
his company, Much Talk to Haven. Can I? I want to get on this. Maybe she'll think it's a real alligator.

122
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:39,259
Look out behind you. Holy shit. I don't know what that was. What she made out of. What are you made

123
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:47,990
out of? No, it was intel.

124
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:13,140
Okay.

125
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:36,150
I keep thinking of the alligator. That's not cool. All right. Okay. I need to go to my hut.

126
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:42,250
Can I go back to the front desk? Excuse me. Where did you say it was again?

127
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,579
I just, I forget. I know you had candy up here and that was a mistake. Get that out of here.

128
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:54,039
You're distracting all of us squirrel people. Was it this way or to the right?

129
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:15,539
Behind you on the right. Right over here. Okay. Do I have to get searched?

130
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,650
Listen to me. You will get that whole fucking container of peppermint candies

131
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,019
and you bring that fucking whole container over here. Okay. You do that. There's a $50 bill

132
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:49,799
with your name on it. I want that. I want that whole fucking container. Make something up. I

133
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:58,309
don't care. All right. There's a message for me in here. Intel. A pamphlet describing the various

134
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,539
activities available to clients visiting Haven Island. The island offers massage facilities,

135
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:08,420
a full gym, yoga lessons, private huts, a fully stocked cocktail bar and a five-star restaurant.

136
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:18,059
Pretty cool. Can I just like, can I just do this? Can I just enjoy the resort? What if I don't want

137
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:31,930
to do anything? This is awesome. I wonder how much this is a night. This is probably like

138
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:43,980
2,500 bucks a night. Oh, there we go. All right. Call this number. A note from Ludmilla Vitrova.

139
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,099
I wonder what she wants from you 47. Regardless, it would be a shame to keep her waiting.

140
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:58,970
All right. So I have to call Vitrova. All right. Let's call her. Don't ever fucking leave without

141
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,660
one of these. You didn't think there was going to be apples in this trip, did you?

142
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:28,920
Well, there are. I wish there was three. Come on. Come on. Yeah, I thought about it. Wait,

143
00:21:28,920 --> 00:22:03,539
can I get that? No, get down. Oh my God. You idiot. Hold on. Save the game. I got to have a

144
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:10,339
point where a nice save slot. Okay, there's that one. I don't remember what any of these do.

145
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm going to go over here. No, I can't ride it. Wait a minute. Was that the guy? I think that was

146
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:30,039
the actual guy. Is this the guy that I need to get rid of? All right. Let's go call Vitrova on

147
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:44,920
phone. What's with all the water everywhere? Well, the point, it's the ocean. What are you talking

148
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:52,460
about? What is this? Is this a shaver? You got to be careful with these things. I talked a lot about

149
00:22:53,099 --> 00:23:00,730
these things are dangerous. All right. Overflow the sink in my own apartment.

150
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,410
No, no. Turn that off. Turn that off. I don't want to do that. This is a nice place. Shit. It's okay.

151
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:30,140
Can I take a bath? No. Where did that go? Okay. It's fine. There's a big dent in it, but it's

152
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:53,380
all right. Let's make the call. I can't do it. I'm going to practice this. Hey, Vitrova. I met you

153
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:02,549
at the bar and I want to say, I think we hit it off. No, I can't do it. Okay, good. I can do it.

154
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:26,920
What's going on? Vitrova, it's Tobias Reaper. I really wasn't nervous. I reviewed your file prior

155
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:34,779
to your arrival and it's very intriguing. An offer. If you're interested, you can find me over at the

156
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:45,880
restaurant. I'll keep it in line. Go to the restaurant and she has an offer. Meet Vitrova

157
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:58,359
at the restaurant as Mr. Reaper. Do I get new clothes? No, I don't have any new clothes. Why

158
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:09,960
did I do this stupid outfit? Two big butterflies. That's a nice touch. Okay. Nothing else in here.

159
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,900
All right. Let's meet. What? What do you mean remove safety pin for the trap door?

160
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:36,440
Oh, am I going to 1980s cartoon villain somebody down here? All right. Should I? I just want to

161
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:48,599
see what it does. Oh shit. All right. It's ice fishing. Stand on it. I can't stand on it. Get

162
00:25:48,599 --> 00:26:03,450
in there. Hold on. Can I be like a trap door spider and just pull somebody in? No, I don't think I

163
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:11,859
want to do that. I think that's just a, I think I don't know. Maybe I dropped somebody. All right.

164
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:22,900
I gotta go to the restaurant. Let's go. Let's keep it moving. Restaurants this way. That's the toilet.

165
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:38,180
You know, I, for a tenth of a second, I believed. What do you mean trespassing? Trespassing?

166
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:48,279
We don't share this whole thing. Let's get this private hut. Yeah. The inside. This is,

167
00:26:48,279 --> 00:27:01,660
I'm not allowed to be over here. Jeremy, this is a hotel. Yeah. But it's an outdoor hotel. I've never

168
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,359
been in one of these before. Sorry guys. I don't have any experiences in a fucking $4,000 a night

169
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:26,660
outdoor cabana place. Quick. I gotta get in there and dance. I had fun too.

170
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:50,650
How do you dance? No, not subdue. Dance. Let's go right here. No. Order a drink?

171
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,130
Why would you poison something in front of everybody? All right. I don't think I can do

172
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:09,609
anything here. All right. Let's go to the restaurant. Guys playing chess. Can I play chess?

173
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,710
Playing chess by yourself. Isn't that how you learn? That's how you get to be like next level,

174
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:32,089
right? You try to beat yourself. Okay. Yeah. You play chess against yourself. So then you

175
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:39,769
always have a move because you know you made it. And then you just gridlock yourself until you win,

176
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:41,930
until one of your brains wins. All right. Let's have the meeting.

177
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,789
Mr. Reaper. So good to see you. Good to see you too. What do you want to talk about? Should I sit

178
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:57,160
down? No. Let's talk. You mentioned an offer. Yes. It's a little embarrassing, but we've had an

179
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,549
incident. A theft. A thief is an employee here. A person working in Mr. Williams's villa at the

180
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:10,869
other end of the island. What was stolen? A USB drive containing some sensitive information.

181
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,829
Personal information, which I would rather not fall into the hands of others.

182
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:22,549
Okay. So my offer is this. Obtain the USB drive from the thief without alerting anyone

183
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,549
at the villa. The thief is likely still there. I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use

184
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:38,250
that particular skill set of yours. Two targets remaining. The trover has been permanently

185
00:29:39,130 --> 00:30:05,500
detained. What the hell was that? Oh, it's another one of these.

186
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,759
She said particular skill set and I had to do it. I don't even talk. What do you mean whiny?

187
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:39,670
I love this game so much. These games are so fucking good. They really are. Just like so.

188
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:47,210
This is so ridiculous. I love it. Sometimes you forget just how much fun you're gonna have in

189
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:58,940
just being a dickhead in these games. Well, now we have to listen to that again. All right,

190
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:13,859
so I have to infiltrate. Mr. Reaper. It's very good to meet you. I'm not gonna do it again.

191
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:21,430
You mentioned an offer. Yes. It's a little embarrassing, but we've had an incident. A theft.

192
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:27,319
A thief is an employee here. A person working in Mr. Williams's villa at the other end of the

193
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:35,420
island. What was stolen? A USB drive containing... Get the USB drive. Personal information,

194
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:43,960
which I would rather not fall into the hands of others. So my offer is this. Obtain the USB

195
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:54,980
drive from the thief without alerting anyone at the villa. The thief is likely still there.

196
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:00,019
I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use that particular skill set of yours to gain...

197
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:05,900
No! I wanted to do the apple! I thought I was gonna do the apple.

198
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,380
Why would I have a melee item equipped? I was gonna hit apples in the face,

199
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:24,089
now I just punched her in the face. What do you mean try again? No. You want me to be stuck here

200
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:40,099
for like 45 minutes? Uh-uh. Did it break the game? The next four hours of the stream is gonna be

201
00:32:40,180 --> 00:33:27,210
this. This is what we pay you for. What about that plan again? Tell me more about that plan.

202
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:35,259
Command? Yeah. It was nothing. It's very personal. Please call me as soon as you've recovered it.

203
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:39,900
I'm sorry. I just was hit in the face by an apple.

204
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,799
It's taken me months to prepare this, and I've been very careful.

205
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,920
We're gonna watch everybody here get fired. I'm really looking through my computer right now.

206
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,579
Okay. Do I have to walk with her? All right. Infiltrate the villa.

207
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:05,299
Good afternoon, sir. I think this is fucked up.

208
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:06,339
The accounts are in place.

209
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,010
To be fair, that hit her square in the face. It was not like in the back of the head.

210
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,429
That was just right in the face. How come I can't pick up these?

211
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:42,019
Yeah. I wonder how many teeth I knocked out. And I got it back. Just gotta rub it off a little.

212
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:50,070
No big deal. Oh, I just pressed the DPI button. All right. So let's infiltrate the villa.

213
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:58,090
So that puts us... Okay. Look at how menacing this thumbnail is.

214
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,619
Eat the apple? No, I need this. This is important. All right. Let's see.

215
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:16,570
So I got to infiltrate the villa, which is down here. I can't vault over this?

216
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,409
All right. We've got to go down this way. Wait, there might be more apples in here.

217
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:27,300
Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs and Clown Daddy. Both of you.

218
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,039
Thanks for the five community subs from each of you. Oh, soda can. Perfect.

219
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,070
What is this? ATM? Ice machine? No. Oh, actually, I probably...

220
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:45,780
Am I gonna stab himself in the face? All right. I think I'm gonna turn on...

221
00:35:45,780 --> 00:36:01,900
I'm gonna get the chef outfit. I think that'll help. All right. Let me get out the...

222
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:33,269
No, I'm just gonna knock him out. Turn this off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!

223
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:39,670
Turn it off! Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no. That's bad.

224
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,190
No, god damn it.

225
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:14,659
Fuck. It's too condensed. It's... All right. It's way too condensed.

226
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:19,380
Where was it? 1340. I can do it. It's gonna be quieter than that.

227
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,500
Lead pipe. The game is quiet. I'll fix that. Just give me one sec.

228
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:39,900
There you go. That should be better. All right. I gotta become a chef.

229
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,980
I think it's... The apple is not silent, by the way. It's very loud.

230
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,940
Everything is loud. So I need... Where's my iPod? All right. The iPod will work.

231
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,739
Let's get the chef to come in here. He'll figure it out.

232
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:11,820
I'm gonna get behind him. I'm gonna close the door.

233
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,730
This doesn't kill him, right? Oh, I killed him. I killed him with the fucking iPod.

234
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:45,530
All right. Well, that's unfortunate because I really did not want to kill that guy.

235
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,780
By the way, I feel like the iPod would break. I feel like these earphones would just

236
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,420
snap and it wouldn't kill the guy. Whatever. Does he know? Does he know that I'm not him?

237
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,960
Oh, meat bone. Nice.

238
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:23,510
What's going on? Well, I'm turning the stoves on. I'm a chef.

239
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:49,179
I turned on the stove. Damn it. And I didn't fucking save it. Oh my God. I'm too... I'm too

240
00:39:49,179 --> 00:40:09,780
ADD in this game. I was there. I turned the stove on. Why is that so out of the ordinary?

241
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:36,039
Wait a minute. The chef just turned on the stove. Let's all fucking run. What? Oh, I don't want to

242
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:50,460
kill him. I just want to knock him out. Whatever. I don't know about this. I don't know about this

243
00:40:50,460 --> 00:41:06,869
guy. Well, I turned on all the stoves, but who cares? What if I had a big dinner service? I love

244
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:13,349
how turning a stove on as a chef is more suspicious than hiding and throwing an apple at the target

245
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:28,010
in plain sight. Save the game. Let's do this one here. This guy was destined to die. No. All right.

246
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:36,019
Don't turn the stove on, but I do want the meaty bone. Plate this up. I'll make it unforgettable,

247
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:41,699
chef. I need poison. Oh, this is awesome. Poison. Poison. Poison. What do we got? Poison.

248
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,880
I need poison first. Where's poison?

249
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,130
Anyway, we also need to find a good way. I had some in Copenhagen a few months back and they're

250
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:01,929
just perfectly tangy in the city. A real treat. Like mighty down on an overripe orange. We go

251
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:07,190
great with the sauteed chinoise and soy garlic. I'm trying to put it up there.

252
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,500
All right. Just put it. Okay. I'm done with that. Where's the pot? Wait. Hey,

253
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:25,739
hey, Mike. Where's the poison? Where do we keep it? Start a gas leak. Cheeseburger. Oh, yeah.

254
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:39,420
Cheeseburger. Nice. All right. Blend in as a waiter. Why do I need to do that?

255
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:48,150
I must remember to grab one. Okay. I gotta put this down. What is it? J? How do you drop something?

256
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:55,559
G? Z. Okay. Hey, mister. I think you dropped that. Yeah, I know. I did. All right. I need to get

257
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:05,380
poison. Perfect. Where can I get poison? Don't touch that. Leave that there.

258
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:26,019
What about over here? No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. Don't. Is he taking it out?

259
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:45,260
Mr. Trova. No shit. Okay. It's perfect. Perfect. Come on. Christ sakes. All right. Poison. Quick.

260
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:56,789
Where can I get some poison? Some hut or some? Where's like the basement? I need like a chemical

261
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:26,940
basement. Is this poison factory? Staff key. Got it. Save it. Poison. No. I'm gonna shoot myself.

262
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:34,599
I had to just walk away and I swear he didn't even notice. He just kept on talking.

263
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:41,719
On a different sub. Let me take this off of him. A little too strong,

264
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:49,219
mister. Let me get. Let me take this off your hands. Let me help you. Let me help you. Get out

265
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:55,659
of the way. I'm trying to help you. Get away from me, you creep. It's my turn to do the dishes. When

266
00:44:55,659 --> 00:45:05,510
have you ever heard something like this? Check up on stock with the key back. Whatever. Yeah. I got

267
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:18,500
the key. Oh, am I allowed to be back here? Oh, that's right. I'm a chef now. Okay. What about

268
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:29,860
the old man? Poison. Poison. No, it's just soda. It could be poison though. It is poison. If we're

269
00:45:29,860 --> 00:46:05,900
talking real life. Am I right, guys? That's funny. All right. I'm getting too distracted.

270
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:11,219
I really am. There's so many things to do here. There's so many places to be.

271
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:18,519
I'm too distracted. I gotta, I gotta focus hard. Is it ready yet? Please don't tell me you're trying

272
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:25,719
to put ants back on the menu. Nobody liked the ants. It's not ready. So here we are. I really hope

273
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:42,489
you like this one because yeah, that would be nice. I missed it. Wait, she's coming in. Sir,

274
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:50,980
your breath stinks. Back off. Okay. I'm rather speechless here. Um, let's pretend I didn't taste

275
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,460
it. I'll come back. You try again. You didn't even get it. That was a garnish.

276
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:10,900
You didn't touch the cheeseburger. Okay, here we go again. All right. Looks good.

277
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:20,119
Oh, that reminds me, I did some experimentation. Your breath stinks. Wait, revolt.

278
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,519
Once that's done, we skin them, slice them thin and ferment them with poison.

279
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:34,860
But I stopped getting distracted. I need poison. Why would you be upset about extra food there?

280
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:04,550
Well, go, go, go, go. Yeah, I kind of do.

281
00:48:44,760 --> 00:49:01,179
Imagine waking up to this. Why me? Why me? Free drinks. Poison. Where was the poison?

282
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:46,070
Somebody said poison. No, it was an accident. I need poison quickly. That was insane.

283
00:49:47,429 --> 00:50:12,170
Oh, that's just mean. Hold on. That was mean. I'm going back. Where was it? You know how hard it is

284
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:18,570
for me to play these games. Some of you guys can be very, very tactical and very precise.

285
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:23,610
That's awesome. But if there's an interaction, like for instance, like I'm just going to pick

286
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:29,619
this up. I kind of have to. I have to pick this up. There was an internal struggle in my head

287
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,820
right there. Don't pick that up. It doesn't matter. I had to pick this up. I had to.

288
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:45,800
I'm watching the stream right now. I'm not participating. You and I are in the same boat.

289
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:52,699
My hands have taken over. I don't know what the fuck is going on.

290
00:50:52,699 --> 00:51:03,670
I don't know what he's going to do next. What? That wasn't that big of a deal.

291
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:16,280
Is this over here of a trash can? If I'm this person, that's... Get rid of it. I'll take care

292
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:49,590
of it. I'm going to save everybody. Hold on. I'm going to rescue us. What? You've all been

293
00:51:49,590 --> 00:52:00,059
rescued. Congratulations. How did nobody give a shit about that? Wait, sand castle.

294
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:12,679
Wait, can I... What? Let me help. This is a beautiful sand castle.

295
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:23,050
Does anyone know this dickhead? Has anyone seen him before? Oh, sorry.

296
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,769
What do you think you're doing, buddy? I'm done with you. I'm getting out right now.

297
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:48,300
I'm never going to get to the end of this mission. I'm sorry. Some guy walks over to

298
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,059
you sand castle and just ruins it with... He puts a big chunk of meat in there.

299
00:52:52,699 --> 00:53:12,760
Did you just get threatened by a gun over a sand castle? Yes. Don't do too much. Hey, good to see

300
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:21,659
you. Good to see you. Okay. What was I doing? Right. I need to get poison. We have to poison

301
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:30,070
the thing. Right? What the hell was I doing? Yeah. Poison. I'm walking by. Don't... Why? I'm

302
00:53:30,070 --> 00:54:00,230
walking by. I'm just walking by. What the fuck are you doing? Okay. Don't walk by that guy.

303
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:19,750
I can't cover. I know. I know. I didn't think. Okay. Don't. Easy. There's a guy right there.

304
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:27,699
Just let me look at the... Let me look at the menu. So I need to go. We need to go over here. So I

305
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:34,019
just got to turn around. Just make my way this way through here. If I come across poison, I can

306
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:40,869
bring it back. That sounds like a plan. All right. Good. Down this way. Watch out for the guys that

307
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:52,440
know who I am. So I have a couple of choices here. Go infiltrate the villa or find poison. I think

308
00:54:52,440 --> 00:55:04,380
find poison is number one. I may actually be able to get poisoned there. All right. I might be able

309
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:18,099
to just get in as the chef. Okay. We're good. I can go through here. Right. They're not going to

310
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:24,579
search me, are they? No, I can't. I'm not going over there. I know I'm not supposed to be over

311
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:28,460
there. That's fine. What about in here? What the hell is this?

312
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,980
All right. So I got to do that. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I need

313
00:55:50,980 --> 00:56:03,739
to... Well, I can't poison her then. Don't poison her. Go to... Oh, fuck. I'm trespassing.

314

1045
02:54:48,659 --> 02:54:52,340
believe i'm saying tyson williams has summoned a doctor

1046
02:54:52,340 --> 02:55:18,120
it's so we never have to see that again

i want to play this mission please wait it's this a there's a patch i'm

1049
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:04,260
downloading a patch right now for hitman 2 i think i just got

1050
02:56:04,260 --> 02:56:15,989
crash booted out to download a hotfix or is this a cloud this is my yeah this

1051
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:31,510
is the cloud sync oh okay well that makes sense then hitman

1052
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:37,930
three oh by the way i've had that germa

1053
02:56:37,930 --> 02:56:42,409
985 is squashed into like four feet tall image on the right monitor the whole

1054
02:56:42,409 --> 02:56:45,590
time i just can't i have an alt tab and close

1055
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:54,059
it it's still over there was i just destined to not play this

1056
02:56:54,059 --> 02:56:56,219
mission this kind of story here i think it's

1057
02:56:56,219 --> 02:57:00,760
possible show it i don't need to show it you guys

1058
02:57:00,760 --> 02:57:04,120
know the one i'm talking about i could be describing 500 different

1059
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:19,239
pictures by the way no we don't no we don't no we don't yes you do

1060
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:24,059
yes you do do the challenge instead of the story mission

1061
02:57:24,059 --> 02:57:33,659
yeah that's a good idea so let's go to uh we have escalation is it game modes

1062
02:57:33,659 --> 02:57:39,290
no no this is wait no destinations okay let's go to

1063
02:57:39,290 --> 02:57:50,819
uh heaven island and then challenges the last made the last resort so i just

1064

content haven island no i already have it is that it's just

1068
02:58:34,379 --> 02:58:36,620
different targets yeah i've thought there was

1069
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:52,329
i remember from the base game contracts trending elusive target the captain

1070
02:58:52,329 --> 02:59:07,909
should we go for the captain let's try it good morning 47 target is

1071
02:59:07,909 --> 02:59:11,350
ruthaford a captain who works at haven resort the owner tyson williams has

1072
02:59:11,350 --> 02:59:15,110
contracted us that he wants ruthaford dead for causing many accidents at the

1073
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:33,180
resort including sinking boats okay just yeah why does

1074
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:39,819
why can't you just fire him that doesn't i don't understand

1075
02:59:39,819 --> 02:59:48,950
flash phone what does this do oh that sounds cool

1076
02:59:48,950 --> 03:00:08,459
all right let's get him captain ruthaford ruthaford ruthaford all right

1077
03:00:08,459 --> 03:00:20,090
eliminate captain ruthaford so you can make a contract for this guy mr reaper

1078
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:31,450
that's pretty cool eliminate the captain all right the captain's in here

1079
03:00:31,450 --> 03:00:36,729
upstairs i wonder how difficult this is going to be

1080
03:00:36,729 --> 03:00:47,100
go just go in there and just poison them this is not going to be this easy is it

1081
03:00:47,100 --> 03:00:53,670
i think i just did it i went i think right

1082
03:00:53,670 --> 03:01:22,500
hey so i just i just have to dump the guy and listen to the story okay

1083
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:30,950
is there an actual story they're all easy to do it like this

1084
03:01:30,950 --> 03:01:51,819
all right let's go so i'm gonna say i'm gonna tail him for a little while

1085
03:01:51,819 --> 03:02:11,399
so he does he's up here drinking comes out here this way and then

1086
03:02:11,399 --> 03:02:16,760
we're gonna listen to what he has to say

1087
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:32,420
soon as i find the rest of this here treasure map treasure

1088
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:39,639
will be mine that means it's probably a treasure easter egg on the island

1089
03:02:39,639 --> 03:02:43,639
right i would think so back off a little buddy

1090
03:02:43,639 --> 03:02:56,459
you're starting to freak me out does he only stay up here

1091
03:02:56,459 --> 03:03:10,520

1093
03:03:13,879 --> 03:03:29,059
does he go anywhere else okay guys quit screwing around here okay he doesn't

1094
03:03:29,059 --> 03:03:33,739
he doesn't look like a person he looks doesn't look a person to me

1095
03:03:33,739 --> 03:03:37,020
he looks like you know gordon ramsay's show when he puts on a bunch of

1096
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:40,059
masks and makeup and stuff and pretends to be somebody in the restaurant that's

1097
03:03:40,059 --> 03:03:46,500

1098
03:03:53,260 --> 03:04:01,299

1240
03:30:53,770 --> 03:31:04,659
easy easy all right right there right there right there right there right there

1241
03:31:04,659 --> 03:31:08,819
right there right there right there right there right there right there right

1242
03:31:08,819 --> 03:31:15,719
there oh clean i did it clean very clean

1243
03:31:15,719 --> 03:31:23,180
see you later that was hard that was fun though

1244
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:34,440
come on give me two three stars come on someone could hurt them so there's even

1245
03:31:34,440 --> 03:31:42,420
more to do here i guess technically not you did it

1246
03:31:42,420 --> 03:31:48,600
start with the standard loadout electrician with the bank rubber disguise

1247
03:31:48,600 --> 03:31:52,629
very cool three stars i'll take it so you just do

1248
03:31:52,629 --> 03:31:54,950
it faster is that how you get higher stars

1249
03:31:54,950 --> 03:32:08,889
so what's the next one yeah you just gotta go faster what about let's look at

1250
03:32:08,889 --> 03:32:13,750
the details fresh disguise silent takedown

1251
03:32:13,750 --> 03:32:21,750
unnoticed never spotted no notice kills no recordings at all non-target kill

1252
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:30,389
how would you get the cop away without making them both get up

1253
03:32:30,389 --> 03:32:34,920
you know what i mean seems hard to do that with a coin but wouldn't they both

1254
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:38,940
stand up all right we got another one if any

1255
03:32:38,940 --> 03:32:42,700
non-targets are eliminated you will immediately fail the mission

1256
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:46,520
i have to retrieve the burial dagger i have to

1257
03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:56,090
kill these two with the burial dagger oh no and electrocution

1258
03:32:56,090 --> 03:33:06,709
holy shit yeah that's not possible i don't think i can do that one

1259
03:33:06,709 --> 03:33:14,469
so here's elusive target this is interesting good afternoon 47

1260
03:33:14,469 --> 03:33:20,870
your target is etta davis also known as the angel of death the target is a

1261
03:33:20,870 --> 03:33:23,750
retired nurse believed to have killed dozens of

1262
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:27,190
patients in retirement homes and hospitals across great britain

1263
03:33:27,190 --> 03:33:31,030
okay her preferred technique is poison though in later years

1264
03:33:31,030 --> 03:33:35,829
she's begun to prefer blunt weapons and violent accidents such as falls

1265
03:33:35,829 --> 03:33:40,069
ongoing intercepts have tracked her to marrakech well i can only one chance

1266
03:33:40,069 --> 03:33:42,629
predictions that she's expanding her hunting grounds

1267
03:33:42,629 --> 03:33:46,870
i can only do this one time oh no that's not good while the target may look like

1268
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:50,229
a harmless old lady it is certain that she will kill again

1269
03:33:50,229 --> 03:33:53,270
repeatedly given the opportunity the clock is

1270
03:33:53,270 --> 03:34:00,389
ticking 47 good luck one chance planning do i get to plan

1271
03:34:00,389 --> 03:34:06,819
anything i do all right let's do the let's take

1272
03:34:06,819 --> 03:34:13,299
the silver baller i'm gonna stay in the regular suit

1273
03:34:13,299 --> 03:34:27,030
fiber wire i never use small gold bar interesting i'll try it coins

1274
03:34:27,030 --> 03:34:33,940
okay i'm gonna pee before this because i only get one chance

1275
03:34:33,940 --> 03:34:38,260
yeah it's piss time it's been like almost four hours and it's time to pee

1276
03:34:38,260 --> 03:37:29,670
see you guys in a minute howdy so this is going to go very very poorly i assume

1277
03:37:29,670 --> 03:37:36,280
because it's been it's been like six months or so or four or

1278
03:37:36,280 --> 03:37:38,840
five months since i've been even on this map

1279
03:37:38,840 --> 03:37:52,760
so no idea we'll find out all right let's go this contract is an elusive

1280
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:55,799
target when playing an elusive target the following rules apply

1281
03:37:55,799 --> 03:37:59,639
you must begin the contract before the countdown expires

1282
03:37:59,639 --> 03:38:03,799
if you die you can't retry if you completed the contract and successfully

1283
03:38:03,799 --> 03:38:10,139
exited you may not retry it okay you can't

1284
03:38:10,139 --> 03:38:12,540
restart the contract you cannot save your game

1285
03:38:12,540 --> 03:38:19,350
the contract briefing may contain additional fail conditions

1286
03:38:19,350 --> 03:38:25,590
start the timer now because i think it's a win for me

1287
03:38:25,590 --> 03:38:31,690
if i last five minutes five minutes from right now if i'm still in this mission

1288
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:43,459
then i win good afternoon 47 we have been unable

1289
03:38:43,459 --> 03:38:46,100
to determine the target specific location

1290
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:51,270
now it's too loud it's like it's like way too loud

1291
03:38:51,270 --> 03:38:54,389
it's super loud now i can't even imagine

1292
03:38:54,389 --> 03:38:58,709
what that explosion was like sent her a few hours ago

1293
03:38:58,709 --> 03:39:02,709
whatever you do don't accept a cup of tea from her 47

1294
03:39:02,709 --> 03:39:08,420
no tea good hunting it must have been so awful

1295
03:39:08,420 --> 03:39:16,790
all right so we've got where is she in regards to the map itself uh

1296
03:39:16,790 --> 03:39:28,979
let's find out my god where are you i don't even know where she is

1297
03:39:28,979 --> 03:39:39,930
oh my god this is gonna be hard all right we need intel

1298
03:39:39,930 --> 03:39:57,690
she's right there huh okay area discovered brick don't pick up the brick

1299
03:39:57,690 --> 03:40:08,120

1300
03:40:08,120 --> 03:40:15,590
what is this is him okay i can get up there

1301
03:40:15,590 --> 03:40:26,620
not allowed up there guaranteed hello i definitely can't go this way right

1302
03:40:26,620 --> 03:40:33,420
they're gonna be like stop listen here yeah sorry but you're not coming all

1303
03:40:33,420 --> 03:40:35,979
right let's go this way i'm assuming i could probably break

1304
03:40:35,979 --> 03:40:41,190
somebody in an alleyway oh screwdriver that takes care of

1305
03:40:41,190 --> 03:40:47,450
that and a wrench good to have cause an oil

1306
03:40:47,450 --> 03:40:56,860
leak here and i approached germa anyway really germa

1307
03:40:56,860 --> 03:41:00,600

do anything wrong it's over how you been there's so many people

1312

so these two are dlc so my uh stream is not alive welcome to siberia 47

1472
04:09:22,860 --> 04:09:27,579
i could do something cool in this one instead of just headshot people

1473
04:09:28,379 --> 04:09:33,399
your destination is the privately owned perm 14 prison facility

1474
04:09:33,399 --> 04:09:39,690
located near the freezing siberian tundra here you're tasked with the

1475
04:09:39,690 --> 04:09:43,530
elimination of vitale reznikov try to kill somebody with an apple

1476
04:09:43,530 --> 04:09:48,010
and roman kabko renowned russian mobster with suspected political ties

1477
04:09:49,530 --> 04:09:54,010
roman kabko has been a prisoner might be possible for the past decade

1478
04:09:54,010 --> 04:09:57,290
but his function more is a second in command than a prisoner

1479
04:09:58,170 --> 04:10:02,969
now he wants out and has offered warden reznikov a bribe to facilitate an early

1480
04:10:02,969 --> 04:10:08,649
release scheduled to take place today kabko's offer comes at an opportune time

1481
04:10:08,649 --> 04:10:13,049
for reznikov it's like a swole golem united nations human rights kind of does

1482
04:10:14,889 --> 04:10:18,569
a string of recent news articles has exposed violence and even murder

1483
04:10:18,569 --> 04:10:24,620
as everyday occurrences in perm 14 our client suspects that kabko's release

1484
04:10:24,620 --> 04:10:30,219
could cause serious diplomatic issues both targets must be eliminated along

1485
04:10:30,219 --> 04:10:33,020
with reznikov's mercenary does the cold mess with how i shoot the gun

1486
04:10:34,219 --> 04:10:40,780
note that the prison's regular guards are not sanctioned targets now the riot is brewing in

1487
04:10:40,780 --> 04:10:45,979
the prison which could be used to our advantage since our client has asked we eliminate the

1488
04:10:45,979 --> 04:10:51,100
targets clandestine you will need to find a way to set the riot off and use it as a

1489
04:10:51,100 --> 04:11:05,110
so i can't just shoot people eliminate the warden roman and then the siberian tigers

1490
04:11:05,110 --> 04:11:31,610
mission is now active nice extended magazine nice it's already on there right yeah okay cause

1491
04:11:31,610 --> 04:11:37,530
a riot and then eliminate as many members of the mercenary death squad as possible so these are

1492
04:11:37,530 --> 04:12:00,790
the two targets see what i can do so i have to start a riot too so i can't just shoot guy so there

1493
04:12:00,870 --> 04:12:13,370
is that is the fucking window he went through the window he went through the window oh i'm damn good

1494
04:12:14,010 --> 04:12:36,549

1496
04:13:24,090 --> 04:13:31,719

1497
04:13:31,719 --> 04:13:36,739
and about to be released from prison he's about to be releasing and up here is the warden

1498
04:13:38,260 --> 04:13:44,440
that is vitale resnikov corrupt warden here at the perm 14 prison facility okay

1499
04:13:46,200 --> 04:13:50,760

i'm kevin and this is melissa we're both with hr and we will be guiding you through this last

1822
05:38:15,209 --> 05:38:23,689
test it's important to stress that there's no pass or fail here it's merely a standard

1823
05:38:23,689 --> 05:38:28,090
personality test meant to gauge how you'll put into our corporate culture all right if

1824
05:38:28,090 --> 05:38:33,930
you're ready let's kick this off okay i'm ready okay so this is a very simple test all you do is

1825
05:38:33,930 --> 05:38:38,409
pick a card and tell us what you see there now it's important to point out that there are no

1826
05:38:38,409 --> 05:38:42,490
right or wrong answers the right answers are about behind them spoiler for everybody watching

1827
05:38:43,689 --> 05:38:49,209
we already did this this is just cleaning it up yes i'm ready all right mr thomas let's proceed

1828
05:38:49,209 --> 05:38:58,119
then if you will please pick the card that most conjures up the word opportunity that one okay

1829
05:39:00,700 --> 05:39:07,299
this is an interesting one what do you see here take in the whole image please and in as much

1830
05:39:07,299 --> 05:39:12,180
detail as possible tell me what this reminds you of what the hell are you talking about

1831
05:39:13,830 --> 05:39:18,470
uh you i thought you guys told you guys said that it's the ones that are just right behind them

1832
05:39:21,750 --> 05:39:30,810
fucking really really stupid like i i i i have no there's no defense on that one

1833
05:39:31,290 --> 05:39:36,650
so i got plenty of offense it's nearly a standard personality test i can't defend that one

1834
05:39:37,849 --> 05:39:41,930
no way i can't all right i can say anything to you guys and it would this i'm ready what do i say

1835
05:39:41,930 --> 05:39:47,130
about that so this is a very simple test all you do is pick a card and tell us what you see there

1836
05:39:47,130 --> 05:39:51,849
there ain't nothing i can do about that that there are no right or wrong answers here it's just to

1837
05:39:51,849 --> 05:39:57,209
give us a better impression of who you are on a psychological level does that make sense yes

1838
05:39:57,290 --> 05:40:02,729
i'm ready all right mr thomas let's proceed then you'd be digging a deeper grave please pick the

1839
05:40:02,729 --> 05:40:07,849
card yeah there's no dude condors up the word okay let opportunity i know sometimes uh when i'm

1840
05:40:07,849 --> 05:40:15,380
wrong that's one of those times this one all right now look at it closely completely then tell me

1841
05:40:15,380 --> 05:40:25,400
do you see an animal or an object animal i see what kind of animal a bird an eagle perhaps very

1842
05:40:25,400 --> 05:40:34,599
interesting a forceful animal anything else it's feeding on something feeding on what a carcass

1843
05:40:35,560 --> 05:40:40,520
the scene is reflected in a pool of blood flowing from the body and do they not know

1844
05:40:40,520 --> 05:40:49,000
it's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill that's very graphic mr thomas yes brutal even

1845
05:40:49,000 --> 05:40:57,000
right very interesting observation mr thomas not what we expected but that's perfectly fine

1846
05:40:57,639 --> 05:41:02,680
let's take the next one shall we pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of

1847
05:41:03,240 --> 05:41:17,369
execution please this one the one all the way to the left this one good choice tell me what

1848
05:41:17,369 --> 05:41:22,889
is the first thing you see here just the very first thing that comes to mind i see a figure in

1849
05:41:22,889 --> 05:41:30,250
a large coat perspective skewed as if i'm looking at him from the ground he's got something in his

1850
05:41:30,250 --> 05:41:38,970
hand he's got something in his hand go on he's on he has dual fire fire caliber pistols i see what

1851
05:41:38,970 --> 05:41:45,849

1852
05:41:45,849 --> 05:42:07,990
very very interesting mr thomas i think it's this one very good this is an interesting one

1853
05:42:09,110 --> 05:42:11,830

1946
06:04:16,470 --> 06:04:22,040
productive very very good i recently made a youtube channel and uploaded my first video

1947
06:04:22,040 --> 06:04:26,439
it's kind of cringy not gonna lie but who cares it's my cringe and i've been getting nothing but

1948
06:04:26,439 --> 06:04:36,250
support anyway see you around go watch the first hundred videos i ever made you know what are you

1949
06:04:36,250 --> 06:04:46,759
linking now yes i've seen this one too this is what i'm talking about like there's just no escape

1950
06:04:46,759 --> 06:04:56,709
i've seen it yes the one with my head is like the size of a grape next to these two people here how

1951
06:04:56,709 --> 06:05:07,689
do you meticulously cut somebody out and just like shrink them by like 25 like it's so i want the

1952
06:05:07,689 --> 06:05:16,380
original and i want this back to back so she can see the the efforts that go into this where's the

1953
06:05:16,380 --> 06:05:44,700
original okay so here's this one and like very very clearly that's a lot of work look at how much

1954
06:05:44,700 --> 06:06:06,220
work that is what the hell is this it isn't really though that's the original no this is the original

1955
06:06:08,840 --> 06:06:14,220
i'm gonna go right to the twitter where it came from the background is plain it's easier to do

1956
06:06:18,740 --> 06:06:26,599
all right so let's this is the original i'll put it next to the other one just so you can see i gotta

1957
06:06:26,599 --> 06:06:45,180
defend myself here otherwise come on what we're gonna do that's not that it where is it okay here

1958
06:06:45,180 --> 06:07:16,900
it is this is the original like look at this see what i'm saying it's so it's so slight like you

1959
06:07:16,900 --> 06:07:30,439
you you've made him larger and you've shrunk it's just it's deceiving you made them like huge you

1960
06:07:30,439 --> 06:07:54,599
made these two 20 bigger and you made me like 10 smaller what can i do though i can't tell it's

1961
06:07:54,599 --> 06:08:00,419
an optical illusion now i just saw them both up close and i was like what the fuck they're both

1962
06:08:00,419 --> 06:08:10,229
fake they're not this is what happens when there's so many fake things out there nobody knows what

1963
06:08:10,229 --> 06:08:26,360
the real one is that's by design it's by design so the truth gets muddy anyways now thank you

1964
06:08:26,360 --> 06:08:33,990
peaceful haley good luck on your youtube channel and you kind of learn a lot about yourself the

06:14:36,389 --> 06:14:42,389
language i'm not sure what that means i don't know how to say it but they say when cooking stream

2000
06:14:42,389 --> 06:14:51,369
just wait maybe someday maybe someday i'll do a cooking stream i don't know just wait it might

2001
06:14:51,369 --> 06:15:02,549
happen i don't know you've been asking for it yeah it's possible someday someday confirmed in

2002

2007
06:15:51,240 --> 06:15:57,430
i mean that that channel has been active for just about a full month now so we'll see what's there

2008
06:15:57,430 --> 06:16:03,049
if i don't think there's enough there for a whole couple hours or two three hours at least then

2009
06:16:04,180 --> 06:16:10,419
i'll do it another time but this should be enough there this is going to be a one-time thing or

2010
06:16:10,419 --> 06:16:19,900
monthly or something it is going to be every time i think there is enough content there to do one

2011
06:16:19,900 --> 06:16:26,180
whether that's once a month or once every other month once there's enough to do a full at least

2012
06:16:26,180 --> 06:16:34,259
couple hours that's when they'll happen and i will announce them at least three four days to at least

2013
06:16:34,259 --> 06:16:41,000
two or three days in advance that they're going to happen usually like a week the last the last

2014
06:16:41,000 --> 06:16:46,009
thing i said about it was before twitchcon i said we would do it after twitchcon at some point so

2015
06:16:46,009 --> 06:16:53,700
friday seems like it's the good day to do it thank you fiti for the 250 bits i forgot you only read

2017
06:17:00,950 --> 06:17:04,630
has been brought to you by the i pay extra money to add disclaimer for the off chance that the

2018
06:17:04,630 --> 06:17:17,000
streamer reads both copies of the message for some reason gang thank you fiti for the six dollars

2019

2021
06:17:27,110 --> 06:17:30,470
for years i've been struggling to fall asleep as my mind would always wander to some really

2022
06:17:30,470 --> 06:17:35,400
terrible fucked up stuff that left me anxious and unable to calm down whenever i have one of

2028
06:18:26,330 --> 06:18:30,250

2029
06:18:30,250 --> 06:18:35,700
people do twitch while they're at work working on a project they just have a tab on another random

2030
06:18:35,700 --> 06:18:46,220
tab just open with almost like a radio station that's all right that doesn't bother me i don't

2031
06:18:46,220 --> 06:18:52,869
know why it would it didn't just kind of however you are consuming what the stream is that's fine

2032
06:18:52,869 --> 06:18:59,880
to me as long as you're getting something out of it that's cool hey thank you maris or maris for

2037
06:19:28,169 --> 06:19:34,869
thank you for even flagging me down in the first place to anybody that said hello at twitchcon it

2038
06:19:34,950 --> 06:19:47,139

2039
06:19:47,139 --> 06:19:55,080
i'm gonna do an official meetup because as the channel has grown i was actually told that i

2040
06:19:55,080 --> 06:20:02,759
couldn't do a hey meet me under this sign i i explicitly asked and i was told that you can't

2041
06:20:02,759 --> 06:20:14,919
do that so next year at twitchcon i'm gonna do an official meet and greet at a booth somewhere just

2042
06:20:14,919 --> 06:20:18,439
because i know there's a lot of people that probably wanted to say hello i know i saw at

2043
06:20:18,439 --> 06:20:21,479
least a few messages afterwards that were like oh i didn't get a chance to see you i didn't get a

2044
06:20:21,479 --> 06:20:30,790
chance to say hello so i'm just gonna do an official one next time and of course besides

2045
06:20:30,790 --> 06:20:39,849
that if you see me walking around and grab me and say hello germa rumble at twitchcon i don't know

2059
06:22:30,549 --> 06:22:37,110
shit streamer when it comes to getting new things added to the channel i really have to get on top

2060
06:22:37,110 --> 06:22:45,419
of that i say it every time but you know it's true it's just true you know we're gonna run the

credits right now here they come because we are now at the end of the stream thank you everybody

2062
06:22:57,450 --> 06:23:11,159

2065
06:23:32,409 --> 06:23:37,819
still learning stream labs obs although i'm probably just gonna go back to regular obs

2066
06:23:37,819 --> 06:23:42,380
because they've added a few great features that i really want to use and it's annoying because i

2067
06:23:42,380 --> 06:23:49,419
just went back i just went to stream labs obs and then found out that they added an insanely

2068
06:23:50,060 --> 06:23:56,840
helpful feature on the new obs that released last week so i'll be back to them unfortunately

2069
06:23:56,840 --> 06:24:03,299
because i really liked stream labs obs's layout but the regular obs is just probably way better

2070
06:24:03,299 --> 06:24:10,169
for me at this point so shit but um where the hell is my credits why are they not here

2071
06:24:10,169 --> 06:24:32,250
where are the credits hello credits where the fuck did they go how come where are my credits

2072
06:24:32,250 --> 06:24:48,150
i lost them how what the fuck is going on they're here somewhere hold on i'll find them they're not

2073
06:24:48,150 --> 06:25:03,860

2074
06:25:05,779 --> 06:25:09,959

2075
06:25:11,400 --> 06:25:22,220

2089
06:27:24,700 --> 06:27:32,139
but if you remember me from about six months ago with dbd ask me in chat if you want to know

2090
06:27:32,139 --> 06:27:35,340
what i mean by that and my mental health has been deteriorating for about a year and a half

2091
06:27:36,060 --> 06:27:47,319
i'm really sorry to hear that i was in kind of a mood and about to get fired from the only job

2092
06:27:47,319 --> 06:27:53,380
i had one of the only reasons i didn't is because the carnival stream so you are a literal lifesaver

2093
06:27:53,380 --> 06:28:06,310
thank you well here's the thing i really truly hope that whatever it is you're going through

2094
06:28:07,639 --> 06:28:15,180
you can really figure it out going through problems going through mental health issues

2095
06:28:16,779 --> 06:28:24,950
it's rough and it's hard to do everybody has their own way of getting through it

2096
06:28:24,950 --> 06:28:50,009
but i really really hope that you can find the right way forward things can get better but it

2097
06:28:50,009 --> 06:28:52,970
may i mean it's not you're saying i don't want to ruin the vibes or anything but

i felt like shit before let me tell you oh yeah everybody has their own path forward

2100
06:29:15,240 --> 06:29:23,939

06:32:35,159 --> 06:32:48,709
sd2 shadows die twice oh all right that's cool yeah because it's like ds1 ds2 bb ds3

2126
06:33:20,009 --> 06:33:25,610
much out of order i've never done dark souls 2 on stream except for that one time when some

2127
06:33:25,610 --> 06:33:32,330
fucking guy climbed in my window and boy was that annoying and it ruined the rest of my playthrough

2128
06:33:33,049 --> 06:33:39,700
i never played it again after that something with things just sour your playthrough you can't go

2129
