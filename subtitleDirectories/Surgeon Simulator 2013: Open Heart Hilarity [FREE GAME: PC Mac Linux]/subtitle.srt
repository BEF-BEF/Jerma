00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,870
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Surgeon Simulator 2013, and if you're wondering why I'm already laughing in this video, it's because this game is absolutely insane.

2
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:27,870
It's one of the most hysterical games I've ever played in my life. I just did a trial run like two seconds ago to kind of know what I was getting myself into.

3
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:34,869
And, holy, everybody that has a PC, this game is free. It's for the Global Game Jam for this past week.

4
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:40,869
And holy shit, guys, you gotta go play this game right now. So let me try to explain what's going on here.

5
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:46,869
So what you have to do is you have to perform a heart surgery. Now, that might sound like a pretty standard game.

6
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:52,869
There's a lot of games like that within the surgery type genre. But this is unlike any other you've ever played in your life.

7
00:00:52,869 --> 00:01:02,049
If you've ever played QWOP, this is just like the game QWOP. You are given a task to do, and the game just mulls it all up for you.

8
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:08,049
You have to, like, for instance, look at my left hand. My left hand is A-W-E-R space, and that's to move my fingers.

9
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:17,219
And then on my right hand, it's the mouse. So left mouse button lowers the hand, and right mouse button is going to rotate the hand, and the mouse, of course, moves my hand around.

10
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:25,579
So the goal here is you have to perform an open heart surgery on this dude. And I don't know how you can play, how you can do this without screwing it up.

11
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:32,579
But I'm going to show you right now. Here we go. Surgeon Simulator 2013, baby. Let's do it. Perform a heart transplant.

12
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,200
Okay, I got my fingers all in check, and let's go. Don't mind me, sir. I'm just going to, like, remove this off your body.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:50,340
No, give me it. I'm having trouble getting the guy's, like, frigging, like, Jimmy cloth off, whatever the hell this thing is.

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,780
All right, I don't want to, like, mess up the desk. Hold on. Put this over here. Why is my arm rotated? It didn't even do anything.

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:08,659
All right. You know what? Just go. My tools. I need those tools. No, get over here.

16
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:17,030
Get this stupid drape off the goddamn table. I just threw, like, the radio down.

17
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,659
All right, success. I have moved the drape off the table. All right, we got to get to the guy's heart.

18
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:33,240
All right, let's go with the bone saw. Come here. No, I don't want to rotate my head.

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,930
No, that's the guy's heart. That's the second heart I have to put in. Can I not move this and get out of the way?

20
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,060
Seriously, get out of the freaking way. All right, I'm going to saw his bones off. We're going to get to his heart. Here we go.

21
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,949
This does not seem to be doing anything. You know what? Just throw it. Get rid of it. No, his heart.

22
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:02,689
He's going to sharp object him with his heart now. Let's go with the hammer. All right, I'm just breaking in.

23
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:15,590
Give me this. Give me the hammer. Come on. Give me the hammer. Oh, sorry, dude. I really do apologize about this.

24
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:24,139
Break it. Just break in. Just smash it. Get me into his heart. Get me into his lungs.

25
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:33,340
They need to rename this game like Lawsuit 2013 because if you were a doctor and you did this to somebody.

26
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,969
Oh, my God. Well, welcome to like a legal battle that you would be in for like six weeks. Oh, I got it. Nice.

27
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:54,219
All right. I OK. Got it. Roger that. The guy's OK. Just get out of the way. Get me. His bones are literally everywhere.

28
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:59,219
I feel so bad for this dude right now. Why is my middle fell? You know what? Oh, I got.

29
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:05,889
Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry. Middle finger, baby.

30
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:14,460
All right. That was really immature. Now my wrist is broken. All right. Let's go get this heart. I could wear my hands.

31
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:22,540
Got it. Under control. It's all under control.

32
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,910
Get his heart out of there. Get these friggin bones out. There we go.

33
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:37,629
All right. Here we go. Now I need my scalpel to cut them out. You know, just bring them all. Bring every scalpel in.

34
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:47,040
Oh, shit. Am I even gripping this correct? I don't even know what I'm trying to aim at right now.

35
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,980
Get down there. Slice open his ventricle. I can't even like get this thing to do what it's supposed to do.

36
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:03,230
Here we go. No, no, not quite. Not quite. Do I have to get rid of the bones? Oh, shit.

37
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, I dropped that one in there, too. A-W-E-R. Here we go. All right.

38
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,350
Oh, man. This is the most awkward thing ever. This is literally so friggin awkward.

39
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:25,800
Hey, you need like a friggin... Let's take a look at your chart. Oh, no.

40
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:35,339
That was the heart. That was the heart I needed to replace. It's over.

41
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:42,439
Dude, I lost the game. I can't do anything now.

42
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,680
I just chucked the guy's transplant heart across the room.

43
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,439
Well, oh, there we go. I was supposed to turn my wrist. Well, you don't get a heart now, man. Sorry.

44
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:02,029
Sorry. Why is this not cutting? I feel like I'm like shit-faced.

45
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:09,779
All right, I got it. It's done. Pick it up. Pick it up. Just rip it out of him.

46
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,540
Hey, you know what? You know what I got to say about that? Get out of here. Yeah.

47
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,540
Well, I absolutely... I lost the game. I seriously cannot go get the heart that's over here, so I lose.

48
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:28,529
Well, that's Surgeon Simulator 2013, guys. If you can do this without destroying your everything...

49
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,529
Wow, that's kind of crazy I can do that.

50
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,529
Link is in the description for this game, guys. You have to go check it out. You have to go play it.

51
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,529
Anyways, thank you so much for watching. Everybody really do appreciate it.

52
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,529
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody. Out!
