1
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:15,699
Hello? Hello? Sorry, I'm late. Very late.

2
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:22,890
I had fucking car trouble. I had trouble with the car.

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,339
Oh, okay, okay. Therefore, all of your- all of your crimes are resolved.

4
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,620
Okay, all of the- that's fine. Yeah, I know what that's like.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Dude, what the fuck? It's my sister's birthday. You're here an hour late?

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,420
We've already did the cake and the candles and shit.

7
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,439
I had fucking trouble with the car, dude. I had car trouble.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,899
Oh, yeah, all right. All right, man. Man, do you need anything?

9
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,740
You want water? You want like a soda or something? Are you good?

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,859
Yeah, I'm good.

11
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,439
It's time to play Destiny 2. Never gonna play Destiny 2.

12
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,120
Mark that and put a stamp on it.

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm sorry, I have to tell you, I'm never gonna play that game. Ever.

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,640
Ever. I'm sorry, and I'm gonna make somebody really upset by saying that

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm never going to play Destiny 2.

16
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,939
Now, about a year or two ago, if you had said,

17
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,340
Hey, Smite Thursdays, I would have said the same exact sentence.

18
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,900
I'm never gonna play fucking Smite on stream. Why the hell would I do that?

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,969
But here we are. So never listen to anything I say.

20
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:49,370
Everything I say is wrong. Incorrect. Did I tweet this? I did.

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,969
I figured, I don't know. I've played it recently. I think it's fun.

22
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,500
Somebody in chat, people in chat were saying to play it and I was like,

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,259
All right, yeah, let's do Smite Thursdays.

24
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,669
It's obviously subject to change, as per our agreement.

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,389
You know, Smite Thursdays may be on Friday, Saturday, Monday or Tuesday.

26
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,319
Smite Thursdays also might never come back ever again.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Depending on community sentiment.

28
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,370
But yes, Smite Thursdays.

29
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:43,430
Oh, but Andy. I was waiting to see what people were gonna do about this.

30
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,270
I wonder if this is gonna be the most toxic chat in 2021.

31
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,719
Stop being so toxic, okay? I wanted to play this game, so I'm playing it.

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,319
Isn't that what you what I'm supposed to be doing as a live streamer?

33
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,060
I want to do something, so I'm gonna do it.

34
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,819
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. You understand?

35
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,740
Karma hates mods. What happened? What'd I do?

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,340
Oh, I'm sorry. Right. This stream.

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,590
This stream is me hating mods. That's right. Sorry.

38
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:24,699
What's your favorite class? Oh, I mean, I got a few.

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,710
But I have really bad performance anxiety whenever I play something like this.

40
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,949
Hearthstone's a really good example.

41
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,990
I have come in first place in Battlegrounds, I believe over like 150 times.

42
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:44,569
I was at my rank was like five or six thousand last season.

43
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,129
If I were to turn that on right now, I would be like, I don't know what to do.

44
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,250
I don't know. I would fuck up everything.

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,770
You guys watched it. You guys saw me do that.

46
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:58,569
Like, I could actually play that game, but I can't in front of people.

47
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,500
Off camera? I can play this game pretty well.

48
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,419
I wouldn't say very well, but pretty well.

49
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,150
I'm gonna forget what the buttons are.

50
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,509
I don't know why this happens to me. I don't understand it.

51
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,699
I haven't played Hearthstone in probably three or four months, maybe five months.

52
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Not since the last Battlegrounds season.

53
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,939
Use an Xbox controller. No, I play on PC.

54
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,139
I'm playing on the computer.

55
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,149
Nobody wants to see you play Smite. Nobody.

56
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,620
Well, I'm sorry, but there's at least 10 people in pre-stream chat

57
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,860
that have been saying play Smite every pre-stream for the last six years.

58
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,740
So there are people that want to see it. I know them.

59
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,180
Smite Tuber.

60
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,100
Well, I think we can get started.

61
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,079
We can play. I want to make sure I can see things, though.

62
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,199
Hold on just a moment.

63
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,389
Where's my info? Where's my info?

64
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,389
There it is.

65
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,019
Because it's been a while, I do want to make sure that I get my brain

66
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,579
recombobulated into the world of Smite.

67
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,110
And what better way to do that than to watch a tutorial on a god tutorial, potentially?

68
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,310
I know there's a lot of them that exist.

69
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,930
I found one.

70
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,459
I'm really into the god Anubis.

71
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,639
I think it's a cool god, but I haven't played it in a while.

72
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,730
So I looked up a guide and I'm just going to try to get back into this world here.

73
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,720
Let's go ahead and watch it.

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,509
Just to refresh my memory, it's been a while.

75
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:07,160
Hey, what is going on, everybody?

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Jerma here with Smite Sunday.

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,319
Welcome to the first Smite Sunday on this channel.

78
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,879
Wait, what?

79
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,720
Where I break down a god or I show you a good gameplay and talk about it potentially.

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:15,879
What?

81
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,000
Or I do a live commentary.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,279
But today is going to be a god breakdown.

83
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,040
I don't know, it's Smite Thursday.

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,680
All right, I'm going to be quiet.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,779
The god of the dead.

86
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,500
And the reason why I'm picking Anubis first to do sort of a god breakdown and sort of small

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,660
tutorial video is because Anubis is one of those characters in this game

88
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,500
that he's not a free god.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,779
He's not one of the free gods.

90
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,540
When you install the same joke, this wasn't a joke.

91
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,899
I actually did this for like three weeks completely incorrectly.

92
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,259
I was one of these people that I first downloaded this game.

93
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,660
I said, oh my God, Anubis, the god of the dead.

94
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,620
Oh my God, I get this guy.

95
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,500
I got to play with him and see.

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,459
He's so cool.

97
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,740
And I would just get trashed on.

98
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,899
And that's because Anubis is one of the most damaging gods in the game,

99
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,620
but he also dies incredibly easily and incredibly quickly.

100
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,980
So I figured because of my early struggles with Anubis,

101
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,220
I figured it would be a good one to start with.

102
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,660
Anubis, the god of the dead, the Egyptian lord of destruction.

103
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,259
What happened to your sexy voice?

104
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,040
I stopped trying so hard.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,360
So instead of reading off of the wiki page and telling you all the damage numbers,

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,319
which are very, very easy to find on the internet,

107
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,519
I'm just going to tell you what the moves do and when you should be utilizing them.

108
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,240
What do the moves do?

109
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,720
How do I do that?

110
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Not using them in different situations.

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,399
So we're going to talk about his number one,

112
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,759
which is Plague of Locus.

113
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,920
It's on the one key skill key number one.

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,079
And upon activation, Anubis will stand still and launch out a bunch of bugs at people in a cone.

115
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,040
Kind of disgusting.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,399
It lasts for three seconds.

117
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,279
This didn't exist back then, guys.

118
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,519
So when should you use this move?

119
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,160
Now, I would typically say that this should be part of this smite beta from 2013.

120
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,920
I'll get into that in a few minutes.

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,839
But they didn't have half the features that are in the game.

122
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,079
Although it does a ton of damage, you won't really be using this early game.

123
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,519
And here's why.

124
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,079
Anubis does not have any escapes.

125
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,199
And if you don't know what an escape is in this game, it's a jump.

126
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,680
It's a dash.

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
Why is he so normal?

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,560
It's really any way to distance yourself from another god or from another player.

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,800
So trying to utilize a move like this, when you have to stand completely still,

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
you're just going to get destroyed behind the other lane.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,639
What about Dexter?

132
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,920
Like, was he pretending to be a normal guy?

133
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,399
In a situation like this, you were level one, level two,

134
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,480
would have been a very, very, very early game.

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,279
You're up in the lane with a buddy of yours, you're playing Conquest.

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,720
And you have this move, you go up and you use it on a minion wave.

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
And you're standing still, the other team sees you.

138
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
They know you're Anubis.

139
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
They know you cannot get away.

140
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,519
So they jump on top of you.

141
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,879
You got to play it safe.

142
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,080
And standing still up at level two in a minion wave.

143
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
I can't watch this anymore.

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,879
This is a lot.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,049
Seven more minutes in this video.

146
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:49,370
Seven.

147
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,909
You need to use your three early game for Anubis, I would say.

148
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,509
But we'll get into that when we get to that.

149
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,590
Also, that kind of leads me to another point.

150
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,950
Oh, that was a good grab.

151
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,830
That was a good grab.

152
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,429
Standing still is bad.

153
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:02,149
It's very bad.

154
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,870
If you stand still and do it at times two speed, fine.

155
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,580
This game, because everything is a skillshot.

156
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,779
Well, most of the things in this game are skillshots.

157
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,899
There's so many stuns, there's so many slows.

158
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,740
There's so many people that will be able to hit you with all of their moves.

159
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,460
You don't want to be standing still.

160
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,779
So that's another reason why the number one is not the best choice early.

161
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,100
So moving on, let's talk about his two, which is arguably his best move.

162
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,220
And that move is called Mummify.

163
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,899
And basically, this is just a stun that you can do very, very frequently.

164
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,899
And it wraps up anybody you hit with it for a maximum of two seconds.

165
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,500
This is an offensive and defensive move.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:38,820
This is just like when your buddy is explaining the game to you, and they're really happy,

167
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,299
and they really, really badly want you to download it.

168
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,139
This is what I hear.

169
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,340
Move and it slows people, you can get a lot more utility out of this.

170
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,980
You don't have to stand still to use it and a little bit better in team composition situations

171
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,500
where Ben Shapiro because of the slow before I go on any further.

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,299
Talk about his number four is ultimate.

173
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,860
We're going to talk about what I said previously, and it is the non ultimate combo.

174
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,940
This is really what you should be trying to accomplish when your ultimate ability is on

175
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,659
cooldown and you instantly place your grasping hands underneath them.

176
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,659
And while they're still wrapped up getting them in the cone of your locust swarm, you

177
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,460
do one instantly as well.

178
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,940
You're close enough.

179
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,980
That's assuming you're close enough.

180
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,299
It takes some practice, but late game, you can really instantly kill people with this.

181
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,820
I got to turn it off.

182
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,379
It's too much.

183
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,259
You can just place your three mummify.

184
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,740
It's too much.

185
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,220
It's too much.

186
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,779
It's too much.

187
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,389
Let's see what it is in slow mo 720p.

188
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,110
What year is it?

189
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,539
That's one of the best things to do as a new person.

190
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,179
Hey, those of you guys that have heard me do this before where I go,

191
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,539
I don't want and people give me question marks.

192
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:45,100
Listen up.

193
00:10:45,100 --> 00:11:01,210
And one of the things about this is if you do not kill the person,

194
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:16,490
let's say you do this, this non ultimate combo, you wrap the person up, bang, bang,

195
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:26,259
do both those moves and you don't kill them.

196
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,940
It really is a drunk person.

197
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:43,460
There ain't a whole lot left for you to do besides turn around and run away

198
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:50,019
or try to auto attack them to death.

199
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,179
I should have just uploaded the video like this.

200
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,820
I feel like more people would have liked it and remembered it more fondly.

201
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
Finally, we're going to talk about his ultimate ability,

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,120
which is very, very self-explanatory.

203
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm not going to spend that much time.

204
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,480
All right.

205
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,679
We're not going to spend any time actually.

206
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,159
I'm going to skip.

207
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,440
So you can put people in a very, very large false sense of security landing your two.

208
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,080
You're in the jungle and you got like an area here, guys.

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,279
I think I've covered most of the things I want to cover with an Anubis.

210
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,559
And the next God will probably be Ares for Smite Sunday.

211
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,919
I'm going to break down Ares.

212
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm going to talk about why he's my favorite God in the game.

213
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,279
Yes, Ares is my favorite God in the game at this point.

214
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,399
It used to be an Anubis that used to be Loki, but now it is Ares.

215
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,759
And we're going to talk about him next week.

216
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,000
Going to break down his moves, going to break down how I play him

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,919
and some of the things you should be doing as Ares.

218
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,159
And that's going to be next Smite Sunday.

219
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,200
So thanks for tuning in, guys.

220
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
I really do appreciate it.

221
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,759
And I'll see you guys all next time.

222
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,159
And of course, take care, everybody.

223
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,919
I did that two more times and never did it again.

224
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,299
It was the lowest viewed thing I ever made on my channel.

225
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,460
Everybody, nobody watched it.

226
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,190
I did it two more times.

227
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,820
I was, in my mind, I was going to do every single God in the game

228
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,509
and Smite was going to be a new secondary game next to Team Fortress.

229
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,549
It was like, holy shit, man.

230
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:29,990
I'm going to have like TF2 and I'll have like Smite content.

231
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,409
I'll be like a TF2 Smite guy.

232
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:35,690
I made three videos on it and it was like I'm never doing that again.

233
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,250
Nobody liked it.

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,139
Everybody, nobody watched it.

235
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,539
So, yeah, I think I know how to play Anubis now.

236
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:49,620
Okay, cool.

237
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,159
Where's the audio?

238
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,240
Uh, yeah, Ares, this is, um, yeah, what the fuck?

239
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,279
The Smite guy is back.

240
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:58,919
Yeah, I'm back.

241
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,659
I took a, I took a seven-year vacation.

242
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,889
I'm back, eight-year vacation.

243
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:07,929
Now I'm the sus guy.

244
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,210
I never was the sus guy.

245
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,929
That implies that I made Among Us videos.

246
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,970
I didn't.

247
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,809
Uh, so here's one thing you need to know about Smite.

248
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,809
There's only one thing you have to really know.

249
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:26,230
And that is, uh, they, they added, um, they added Ninja Turtles.

250
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,299
All the Ninja Turtles are in the game.

251
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,220
And, um, Airbender is in this game, too.

252
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Legend of Airbender?

253
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,740
What's the fucking goddamn name of that show?

254
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,399
Can I, don't tell me what it is.

255
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,279
Oh, shit.

256
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,159
Hold on.

257
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,759
Aang, the last Airbender?

258
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,600
Avatar, the last Airbun-bun.

259
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,399
Avatar, the last Bundy.

260
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,759
It's Al Bundy's son.

261
00:14:59,139 --> 00:14:59,860
Uh, I, hold on.

262
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,419
I have to, I have to shut this off for a second.

263
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,779
Because I have to figure out how to fucking make it so nobody can, like.

264
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,700
I have an invite.

265
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,379
Oh, what the fuck did I, what have I done?

266
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

267
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,220
Hold on a minute.

268
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,179
I thought I did this.

269
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,740
What the fuck?

270
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
No, stop friend requesting me.

271
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,700
How do I turn this off?

272
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:18,980
Stop it.

273
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,070
No, I don't know how to turn this off.

274
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:26,409
Oh.

275
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,179
Can I not turn this off?

276
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,889
Am I gonna get, like, where is it?

277
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:35,389
Profile.

278
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:36,809
Private profile.

279
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:37,690
Private profile.

280
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,169
Private profile.

281
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:43,129
Private profile.

282
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:43,850
Account.

283
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,490
Private.

284
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,210
How do I do this?

285
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,450
Somebody please tell me how to do this.

286
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,789
How do I do it?

287
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:54,169
How do I actually do this?

288
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,440
I can't find it.

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,379
Turn it off?

290
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,200
From a new house flipper DLC.

291
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,879
No, that's not what I asked.

292
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,320
How do I, what, how do I turn this off?

293
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,960
Write slash DND in chat.

294
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,200
How you doing?

295
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,690
Am I being lied to?

296
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,039
You're now in DND.

297
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,509
But how do I make it so people can't do that?

298
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,070
What the fuck?

299
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,389
Option settings, privacy profile, sus.

300
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,870
Fuck.

301
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,429
God damn it.

302
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,899
Why did I read that?

303
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:34,779
All right.

304
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,659
You guys ready?

305
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,090
Put a sensor bar over your name.

306
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,730
It's, I don't, I made a new account specifically

307
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,850
because I knew that was gonna happen.

308
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,409
Go to view.

309
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,470
Somebody's got it.

310
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,309
Go to view friends and click the little down arrow

311
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,750
and press do not disturb.

312
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:54,190
Can I, can I, like, make myself private?

313
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,429
All right.

314
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:55,470
I'm just gonna get, you know what?

315
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,590
I'm just gonna, I gotta practice.

316
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,169
I gotta practice.

317
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,690
Profile bar in the top right corner.

318
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,369
I don't want you to fucking see this shit.

319
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,680
Oh, I got a Royale coming my way.

320
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,680
That was my Fortnite name.

321
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,329
Okay.

322
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,230
Um, I think I did it.

323
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,950
I think I'm fine.

324
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,529
Whatever.

325
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,690
Yeah, I was gonna play Fortnite for like an hour

326
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,400
and I was like, that's a fun name.

327
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,440
All right, play.

328
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,000
You guys ready?

329
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,079
I just gotta, I gotta get back in the swing of things.

330
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,160
I gotta adjust my chair too.

331
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,599
This is a chill stream.

332
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,359
I wanna chill and play this game.

333
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,759
I'm only level five so I can't do anything interesting.

334
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,099
Go to profile and click delete.

335
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:47,339
All right.

336
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,220
So this is like the ultimate stream sniper game

337
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,819
because it's just a countdown and when it gets to zero,

338
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:55,339
it just takes a pool of the people there.

339
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,319
So like, I can't.

340
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,640
I was gonna pre-record myself clicking this and waiting

341
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,880
and then just like, like I didn't Hearthstone that time

342
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,839
but I ran out of time.

343
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,160
So like, how do I make it so the least amount of people

344
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,240
can like, can spawn camp me?

345
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Turn on streamer mode.

346
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
There's a streamer mode?

347
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,789
Where's the streamer mode?

348
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:20,430
What?

349
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,279
Did I not turn this on?

350
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,759
Where is it?

351
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,559
It's in the settings?

352
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,680
No, you fucking liars.

353
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,200
There's no way it's in here.

354
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
Look at the goddamn options.

355
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,039
Holy shit.

356
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
I already did.

357
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,089
Settings.

358
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,079
Spectator.

359
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,549
Friendly team.

360
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,589
Key bindings.

361
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,069
Interface.

362
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,170
Options, profile, privacy, streamer mode.

363
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,210
Options, profile, privacy mode.

364
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,839
Options, profile, profile, privacy mode.

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,720
That's not here.

366
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,710
Privacy mode.

367
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,269
This is a lie.

368
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,470
I'm just fucking queuing up.

369
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,109
I don't even care.

370
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:12,750
And I look, I'm not gonna tell you guys when I queue up.

371
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,180
No one's gonna fucking know when I do that.

372
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,630
I'm not gonna tell you what I queued up for either.

373
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,309
Well, look at that.

374
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,029
How does that sound?

375
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
I could have queued up for anything.

376
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,130
What am I gonna, what am I playing?

377
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,609
Who knows?

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,720
Windows G.

379
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
That's like the Windows gamer mode.

380
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
That's not accurate.

381
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,960
Oh, it's a Windows G.

382
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
By the way, I'm gonna show you guys.

383
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
Hey, hey, queues up.

384
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
Okay, queues up.

385
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
This is the point where everybody that you know

386
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,799
that plays this game fucking sprints to the bathroom

387
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,460
after hitting accept.

388
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,900
You can like hear them over the microphone.

389
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:03,099
Just like, okay, queues up.

390
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,890
I don't want you guys to know what I did.

391
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:11,980
All right, here we go.

392
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,460
What did I pay?

393
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,660
All right, who do I want to play with first?

394
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,910
This is like, it's a warm-up game.

395
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,349
This is, this is arena.

396
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:24,680
Audio is really fucking low.

397
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,230
Who should I play with?

398
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,869
The frog?

399
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:28,829
That's a skin, man.

400
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,349
That's like a $20 skin or something.

401
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:30,910
I don't have that.

402
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:33,690
Random?

403
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,809
No, I can't do that.

404
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,890
I don't know how half these guys even work.

405
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,650
I've played like seven characters.

406
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,880
No, we're, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

407
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,599
I know how to play.

408
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,279
We need a fucking guardian is what we need.

409
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:48,920
Oh, we got one.

410
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,420
All right.

411
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,970
Should I play?

412
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,650
All right, we got, we got magic, magic, physical, physical.

413
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,210
We're good.

414
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,849
No, this is good.

415
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,789
I'm not, I don't know.

416
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,269
Anubis?

417
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,599
All right, yeah, because he asked.

418
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,440
Yeah, and I bought the skin even on the,

419
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
I bought a skin even on my dummy account, which is this one.

420
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,119
I bought two skins.

421
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,160
I love this character.

422
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,440
All right, do you guys want Stargazer or the Senko Sage?

423
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,940
Which one?

424
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,130
I need a few warm-up games.

425
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,440
All right, I've seen a lot of sages.

426
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,319
Boy, I got boosters.

427
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,559
Okay, everybody gets a voice pack.

428
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,109
I'm on it.

429
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,839
You got a furry skin.

430
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,079
Every character has a furry skin, okay?

431
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,359
Half the characters in this game are furries.

432
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,119
So what's wrong with you?

433
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:53,069
All right, we got, we got a level 10 Thanatos on the other team.

434
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,099
This is bad.

435
00:21:55,099 --> 00:22:01,549
This is, this is one of you guys, isn't it?

436
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:02,670
You knew I was going to pick Anubis,

437
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,670
so you're just going to execute me over and over again.

438
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,910
All right, I got, I got to prove that I could play video games.

439
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:16,039
All right, let me prove it.

440
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:16,539
Okay.

441
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,559
One thing that I noticed, did they, did they delete boots from the game?

442
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,329
I remember you used to buy boots.

443
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,450
Did they fucking delete it?

444
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:28,509
Where is it?

445
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:36,000
So you're telling me that eight years later, they removed boots from the game.

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
So what do they, is it, is it, do you, does everybody run the same speed?

447
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,480
No, I don't understand how that works.

448
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,299
All right, let me just fucking get my, oh, that's, I'm ready.

449
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,019
That's all I need to do.

450
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,420
Okay, so I have, this is arena.

451
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,859
And in arena, what you want to try to do, it's very important,

452
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,619
is stick together with your team.

453
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,109
One thing people do all the time in Smite is they break up too frequently.

454
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,819
These are the damage buffs over here.

455
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,700
Well, they're not, they're not all damage buffs.

456
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,500
Look at this guy over here.

457
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,619
Hi, my name is Ra.

458
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:15,140
Yeah, he's funny.

459
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,940
He's a funny character.

460
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,180
But you, you, you don't want to break up too much.

461
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,259
Be careful, stick together and utilize your abilities as a team.

462
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,380
Oh, what's that?

463
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:28,900
Oh, somebody got you.

464
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,609
As you see, what I did there is, I'm going to kill this meat.

465
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:38,980
Kill stealer.

466
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:47,059
Go away from me.

467
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,309
Go away from me.

468
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,589
What are you, are we a watcher?

469
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:51,230
Are you a sniper?

470
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,269
Are you stream sniping me?

471
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:59,599
Is this main channel material?

472
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,160
It is not.

473
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:02,289
All right.

474
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,329
What do I want to do?

475
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:04,289
Well, I want to cool down.

476
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:04,930
Chrono spin.

477
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,250
Let's go.

478
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:09,970
I did, oh, he doesn't finish, it doesn't finish item Andy.

479
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:11,460
Relax.

480
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,859
I got it.

481
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,140
Let's go.

482
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:20,509
Let's go.

483
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,109
All it takes is a minute and I get the fire.

484
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:22,750
I get it again.

485
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:31,059
Just give me a minute.

486
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:31,619
That's all I need.

487
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:35,150
Where are they going?

488
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,869
Oh, that's Tinnitus.

489
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:36,349
That's Tinnitus.

490
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:40,900
Help me.

491
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,460
Somebody help me.

492
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Oh, that was pretty good bait.

493
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,799
I'm good.

494
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,829
Where your mic is on?

495
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:55,549
What are you talking about?

496
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:58,190
Speaking of killing sprees, we've got one coming up.

497
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,150
My mic is on?

498
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,559
To be honest, I don't think anyone's surprised.

499
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:02,799
Mike.

500
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,339
Where?

501
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:11,119
Are you Mike?

502
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,000
Turn your mic off?

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,400
I don't have it.

504
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,200
What do you mean my mic?

505
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,259
What shit is off?

506
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:26,460
No, you're talking about it.

507
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:27,980
Oh, you.

508
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,299
Okay.

509
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:29,819
I see what you're doing.

510
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,740
You're talking about like you guys are in the game and I'm an annoying guy.

511
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,059
Okay.

512
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:34,539
I get it.

513
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,869
All right.

514
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:54,829
You guys stop fucking with me.

515
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:55,869
I would have killed that guy.

516
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:56,509
Stop fucking with me.

517
00:25:58,589 --> 00:25:59,549
I'm in arena.

518
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:00,190
What did that guy say?

519
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,309
You should stick to arena.

520
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,670
I'm playing arena right now.

521
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:08,700
All right.

522
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,180
I'm going to be quiet.

523
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:13,710
Jump.

524
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,890
There it is.

525
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,829
It's Mike Pro League.

526
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:25,710
Here we go.

527
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,349
I have no, we're just playing for fun.

528
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,109
This is a fun game, Andy.

529
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:30,349
Okay.

530
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:39,200
You want to see me jungle?

531
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,529
Okay.

532
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,609
We're going to do custom games, right?

533
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:48,130
If you want to see an absolute disaster, then you put me in the jungle,

534
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,650
but I need some pros on my team.

535
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,720
I need some people that really know what the fuck they're doing.

536
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,109
Oh shit.

537
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:56,670
Stop talking.

538
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:56,990
Okay.

539
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,630
I gotta stop talking.

540
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:00,609
All right.

541
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,529
I guess this is why I can't play games like this and scream.

542
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,849
I can't, I just talk and my brain doesn't play the game.

543
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:05,890
All right.

544
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,289
Quiet.

545
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,099
I get into like autopilot mode whenever I start talking.

546
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:19,950
I don't have two hemispheres in my brain.

547
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,829
I have one.

548
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,430
It's just one gigantic circle.

549
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:30,609
Get her.

550
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,009
Get her.

551
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:31,329
Get her.

552
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:39,470
Careful.

553
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,210
Hey.

554
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,250
Hey.

555
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:44,690
Hey.

556
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,740
Fuck.

557
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,140
I missed.

558
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,859
I'm so sorry.

559
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,140
I was trying to make a joke and I missed.

560
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,180
Oh, I hit the wrong button.

561
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,420
Shit.

562
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,740
Oh, give me that triple.

563
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,700
Oh, yeah.

564
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,059
You, you're a viewer.

565
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:15,859
I don't get out of here.

566
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,420
Remember everybody that's good that hurts me is a viewer.

567
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
Doesn't matter.

568
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:29,809
Ice.

569
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:31,730
Oh, come on.

570
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,210
Fuck that.

571
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,410
Where should I be?

572
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:40,849
No, stand in the way.

573
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:41,170
I got it.

574
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:42,910
All right.

575
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,230
Done that.

576
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:43,950
What the fuck happened?

577
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:44,589
What's going on?

578
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,599
What the fuck just happened?

579
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
What's the range on that motherfucker?

580
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:50,720
What?

581
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
I don't think anyone's surprised.

582
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,680
Trips for days.

583
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
A gift from my most loyal observers.

584
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
I must go all out.

585
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,819
Ego.

586
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:01,420
And that guy.

587
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,380
Oh.

588
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,750
Oh, let's use speed.

589
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,349
I know it's the worst thing in the game, but I don't care.

590
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:11,250
All right.

591
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,210
Who do I want to grab here?

592
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:17,650
Oh, shit.

593
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,130
Oh, God.

594
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,450
Oh, God.

595
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,329
This is where it's time to shine.

596
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:19,809
Time to shine.

597
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:20,289
This is where a new...

598
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,049
This is truly where a newbie shines.

599
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,119
We're still in this.

600
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,019
I don't know.

601
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:30,180
I just...

602
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,579
I hit four.

603
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:31,220
Why did it not go off?

604
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:36,210
What the fuck?

605
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,539
Hello?

606
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:39,019
Excuse me.

607
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:39,339
Why...

608
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,059
I'm pressing button.

609
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,339
What the fuck is happening?

610
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:41,579
What?

611
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:44,980
What is going on?

612
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:50,990
Yeah.

613
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,549
What the fuck?

614
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,019
I was pressing buttons and it didn't do anything.

615
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:58,579
That was weird.

616
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,700
All right.

617
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,500
Here we go.

618
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,180
You got silenced?

619
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,579
No, no, no.

620
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,220
It was after that.

621
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,079
They added silences to the game.

622
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,799
Oh, now it's...

623
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,680
Now it's really gone.

624
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,480
Completely off the rails.

625
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,880
No, no.

626
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm not...

627
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
I don't like it anymore.

628
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,140
Your mic is on.

629
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,700
Stop.

630
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,019
All right.

631
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,539
I need to pay attention because when I pay attention,

632
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,339
that's when shit happens.

633
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:34,579
Ready?

634
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:35,059
I'll show you.

635
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,049
After that.

636
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:50,769
There's too many people on the team that are good.

637
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:53,730
Oops.

638
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,500
I just completely missed.

639
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,059
This is warm.

640
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,980
It's the first game I've played in like three years.

641
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,460
Relax.

642
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,410
I'm already running fast.

643
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,450
Wait, that was an enemy, wasn't it?

644
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:19,779
Why would I play Anubis like for the first game on stream?

645
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,049
He like sucks.

646
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,690
Why would I play this guy?

647
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,009
No.

648
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:25,410
Shut up.

649
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,130
He's good.

650
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,170
He's my favorite character.

651
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,099
Your only tank is AFK?

652
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:45,980
Oh, shit.

653
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,460
Oh, well.

654
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,859
Anyway, you're in Anubis main.

655
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,819
Now, I do the thing that we all do when we play games like this.

656
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,799
Like, you know what?

657
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,920
I love this character.

658
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
It's like my favorite character.

659
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,160
They're super fun.

660
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,880
They're super cool.

661
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,599
But anytime you lose with this kind of character,

662
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,400
it's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

663
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,880
This character is a low tier garbage character.

664
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
And like, why do I play this character?

665
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,480
Oh, I don't play fucking Thor, right?

666
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,859
No, I play Anubis because he's like a C kind of D tier character.

667
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,220
He's awesome, man.

668
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,259
It's like I'm like different.

669
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:22,700
I play the game like differently than everybody else.

670
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't play the meta.

671
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,839
And then when you lose with this character,

672
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,460
this character sucks.

673
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,630
And the only reason why you are losing is with this character

674
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,069
because this is a bad character.

675
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,500
And I've chosen to play it because I want to look like different.

676
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,460
That's what I do.

677
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,420
And you all do it, too.

678
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,980
Don't lie to me.

679
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:55,259
I'm actually not really doing that poorly.

680
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,750
Jerma is just built different.

681
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,589
And now I left the game.

682
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,190
Oh, this is low MMR, right?

683
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,240
In low MMR games and in every one of these MOBAs,

684
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,329
people just leave.

685
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:14,049
I forgot this low MMR arena.

686
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,690
What do I expect?

687
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,420
Oh, get him.

688
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,339
Nice gag game.

689
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:31,220
Now play Deathloop.

690
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,140
I'm having fun.

691
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,019
Let me have fun.

692
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:51,259
Okay.

693
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:52,779
Wait, watch out for the big guy.

694
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,180
Play House Flipper?

695
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,539
I don't want to play House Flipper.

696
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:02,740
I don't want to drink the same coffee every day.

697
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,700
I want a different coffee.

698
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,789
Sometimes you want a hot coffee.

699
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,150
Sometimes you want a cold coffee.

700
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,230
Sometimes you fucking get a guaranteed kill.

701
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,110
Maybe even two of them.

702
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:25,860
I mean, it's my favorite character for sure.

703
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:28,510
Yeah, more than two to one Katie.

704
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,670
Yeah, this is my favorite character in the game.

705
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:37,889
Yeah, I mean, this is a really good character to be trying to play.

706
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,900
What does that mean?

707
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,139
What does that mean?

708
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,840
What the fuck does that mean?

709
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,010
Why is every character talking?

710
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,449
No, I have to turn that off.

711
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,570
I have like a voice pack on.

712
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,179
There's a Thanatos execution.

713
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,489
Is that what that was?

714
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,449
I don't know.

715
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,090
I freaked out.

716
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,289
Thanatos does so much damage.

717
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,050
I probably could have gotten really embarrassed if I didn't do that.

718
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:24,690
Get it.

719
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,699
Dude, what's going on here?

720
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:34,139
We're down a player, right?

721
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,280
It's a skin.

722
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,920
Okay, I see.

723
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,610
All right.

724
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,650
What are we doing here?

725
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:45,809
Run.

726
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:53,659
Do you look up builds?

727
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,460
No, I'm not playing Conquest or anything.

728
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,340
I'm just playing for fun.

729
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:04,400
You play Metroid Dread?

730
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,039
I don't think so.

731
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:11,420
Nice.

732
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,139
Good job.

733
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,500
Excellent work.

734
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,619
Oh, this is how we get it.

735
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:17,420
This is how we bring it back.

736
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,949
Let's bring this shit back right now.

737
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:22,449
First game win.

738
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,010
Come on.

739
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,289
Even with down a player, we can do it.

740
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,730
Yeah, let's do it.

741
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,130
Come on.

742
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,019
Speaking of killing sprees.

743
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:36,460
We've got just like my hopes and dreams.

744
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:36,860
They're all.

745
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,059
I got that kind of money.

746
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,860
I got it back.

747
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,269
Let's use the opinion of Sora and Smash corporate.

748
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:52,110
Did somebody report that guy from my most loyal worshipers?

749
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,070
Okay, let's go.

750
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,309
Wait.

751
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, you bastard.

752
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,960
Why did I do that?

753
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,159
That was so stupid.

754
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,360
I just got so greedy.

755
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,559
I was obsessed.

756
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,679
I was obsessed.

757
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,559
What was wrong with me?

758
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,760
Anubis is the easiest at far away range.

759
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,119
Anubis is so easy to dodge.

760
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,730
All right, we're going to win.

761
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,329
We're going to take this back right now.

762
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:38,269
Hey, defensive.

763
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:38,750
Defense.

764
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:40,179
Defense.

765
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:40,820
Defense.

766
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,539
Let them come to us.

767
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,989
Defense.

768
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,099
We win four more team fights and nobody dies.

769
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:49,420
We win.

770
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,989
There was a type of guy to put to pee in the sink.

771
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,590
Only in an emergency.

772
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,570
Defense.

773
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,849
Get him away from us.

774
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,889
One ticker left.

775
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:06,289
It's over.

776
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,780
Sorry.

777
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,099
I don't care.

778
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,059
We're guaranteed to lose.

779
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:25,579
Who cares?

780
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,710
All right.

781
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,070
You don't change topics.

782
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,710
What was the topic?

783
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,139
Appealing.

784
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:35,460
All right.

785
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,699
Nice.

786
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,059
Good job.

787
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:38,239
We were down a player.

788
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:45,170
Level 14.

789
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,809
I was like what?

790
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,250
Oh, shit.

791
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:50,690
Okay, let's play again.

792
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,250
Toxic streamer.

793
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,010
Wait, I said only in an emergency.

794
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,280
I don't know.

795
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,480
I said the first thing that came to my head.

796
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:05,889
Are you going to play Diablo 2?

797
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:07,570
I'm not going to play Diablo 2 on stream.

798
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,530
That is a me game.

799
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:10,429
Only for me.

800
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:15,360
Oh, turn the announcer off.

801
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,519
Right.

802
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,480
How do I do that?

803
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,980
It's in my like loadout, right?

804
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
Profile.

805
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,900
What is it?

806
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,860
Is it in the God screen?

807
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,300
Where is half of this shit?

808
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,019
Look at all these.

809
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:32,900
Oh, my God.

810
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,699
Jesus Christ.

811
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,280
Wizard 101.

812
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,849
No, don't press.

813
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,170
I press.

814
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:46,699
Fuck.

815
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:47,900
I was trying to like hide.

816
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,139
No.

817
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,500
I did it too late.

818
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,289
Oh, God damn it.

819
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:57,219
I was trying to hide that.

820
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm so stupid.

821
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,380
How do I turn this guy?

822
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,699
Loadout.

823
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:00,780
There it is.

824
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,099
Okay.

825
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:01,739
Announcer pack.

826
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,860
Turn it off.

827
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,139
Okay.

828
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:10,320
Got it.

829
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,679
Toxic waste mask.

830
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,590
I don't want to do any of this.

831
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:16,909
Wait.

832
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:17,389
Okay.

833
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,349
I was trying to hide the game.

834
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,449
We want Toon Town.

835
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:25,090
I can't get Toon Town to run.

836
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,460
I already streamed Wizard 101.

837
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,260
What are you talking about?

838
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:39,460
I streamed Wizard 101 like three or four years ago.

839
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,780
Whatever.

840
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,820
If you're going to stream Snipe Me,

841
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,619
you're going to stream Snipe Me.

842
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,820
You have to have like a two MMR to get into these games.

843
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,860
That was part of the point.

844
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,710
You have 10k viewers on Smite.

845
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,469
That's cool.

846
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:02,269
Yeah.

847
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,230
You know, look.

848
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm just hanging out just having fun.

849
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,579
If you find this stream to be not to your liking,

850
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:10,750
then you don't have to stick around.

851
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,269
But there's a lot of people here.

852
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:12,989
What's up?

853
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:14,429
We're going to do viewer games later.

854
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,610
We're going to do some like comedy games.

855
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,409
I promise.

856
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,719
All right.

857
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,360
Who should I play with?

858
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:29,760
Well, we got Hunter.

859
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,460
Brawler.

860
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,739
So we have Warrior.

861
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:33,409
All right.

862
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,369
We have physical, physical.

863
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:34,690
All right.

864
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,369
I got to be a guardian.

865
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,130
I can be anything.

866
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,650
Be anything I want.

867
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:48,219
Play somebody on the bottom three.

868
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,099
Like Cthulhu.

869
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:49,500
I don't know.

870
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,780
I don't know that character's moves.

871
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,099
All right.

872
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:53,820
I got to make a choice.

873
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,659
We got magic, magic.

874
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:56,460
Physical, physical.

875
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:01,650
Jormungandr is a tank.

876
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,130
So maybe I should play Cthulhu.

877
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:09,420
I don't know how to play Cthulhu.

878
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,260
How about Amazenkab?

879
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
Amazenkab.

880
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,199
I think that's what I'm feeling right now.

881
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,000
Double Hunter.

882
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,869
I'm just going to spam Machine Gun.

883
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:27,360
That's the one.

884
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:37,389
This actually was my favorite character back when I played a lot.

885
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,179
Literally nobody wanted this.

886
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,019
Look.

887
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,059
Do you understand?

888
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:43,380
Okay.

889
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,469
There's 10,000 people here.

890
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,900
If I asked all 10,000 of you what your favorite ice cream was,

891
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,980
you're all going to have different favorite ice creams.

892
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,840
Some of you are going to say chocolate.

893
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,559
Some of you are going to say vanilla.

894
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,440
Some of you are going to say strawberries.

895
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,039
Some of you are going to say like cookies and cream.

896
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,320
Everybody has things they like.

897
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,050
It's hard to agree on exactly what game everyone wants to see.

898
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,250
And then maybe you like all ice creams.

899
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,130
Maybe you only like a few.

900
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,650
Maybe you like frozen yogurt.

901
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,170
Maybe you don't even want ice cream.

902
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,300
Are you a hard ice cream or a soft ice cream?

903
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,260
Soft serve.

904
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,789
A lot of different opinions here.

905
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,579
That was a very long-winded way to say time that person out for 20 minutes.

906
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,550
Okay.

907
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,269
Here we go.

908
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:37,260
Now make it two.

909
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:37,820
Make it 10.

910
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,860
Make it 10 seconds.

911
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,340
Wait.

912
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,219
I need a relic.

913
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:46,219
What the fuck was that?

914
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,579
Why is a cookie monster in my game?

915
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:50,460
What's going on?

916
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,099
Fuck.

917
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,219
I need to buy one of these.

918
00:43:53,219 --> 00:44:05,659
This is cool.

919
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:11,980
If you don't know about Amazenkab, he's the god of bees.

920
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:13,340
He plays hives.

921
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,579
They give you attack speed, movement speed, and I believe mana per five.

922
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,980
He also has a bee swarm, which is his second ability, which swarms.

923
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,300
He's got sticky honey goo, which is a slow and it's trail.

924
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,219
And his ultimate is the stinger.

925
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:30,860
And if you get it in somebody, you get to pick it up and do it again.

926
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,820
But the way you should be playing Amazenkab is strictly auto attacks only

927
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,019
and build a shitload of attack speed.

928
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh, this is it right here.

929
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,500
Baby, come on.

930
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:54,980
This is it.

931
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,539
This is the one.

932
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:57,309
Thank you.

933
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:58,510
I'll pick that back up.

934
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,909
And the cooldown is only 15 seconds rather than 80.

935
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,150
Did I get that kill?

936
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,510
Somebody stole it from me, but that's fine.

937
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,670
I have this opinion if you are.

938
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,699
I get him.

939
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,500
If you complain about kill stealing in arena.

940
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:24,130
All right.

941
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,690
Don't be cocky.

942
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,250
Don't be an idiot.

943
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:31,070
Bop.

944
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,789
Who is the cookie monster?

945
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:38,380
This is one of the most boring gods in the game.

946
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:39,860
Yes.

947
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,059
But if you take boring and remove it and put like put white out over it

948
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:48,099
and then write effective on it, it's essentially saying the same thing.

949
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:48,420
Aren't you?

950
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,300
Oops, that was the wrong item.

951
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,340
Oh, that's all right.

952
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,619
He's very effective.

953
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,190
Yeah, sure.

954
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,269
Just going boom, boom, boom, boom.

955
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:02,989
That's like boring.

956
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,269
You don't have to like, you know, there's no jump.

957
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:14,480
Did I just hit a fucking minion with that?

958
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,599
I just hit a fucking minion with my ultimate, of course.

959
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,469
It's awful.

960
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:24,590
Does it go through minions?

961
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,070
I don't remember.

962
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,219
Nice.

963
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,090
Don't get cocky.

964
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:35,329
Come on.

965
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,530
Back it up.

966
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,139
Let him have fun.

967
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:39,860
Oh, thanks, guys.

968
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:45,840
Just body blocked.

969
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,239
I'm sorry.

970
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:56,590
Oh, three in a row.

971
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:56,989
Let me get it.

972
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:00,349
Let him have fun.

973
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,510
I'm just trying to have fun, right?

974
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,750
It was no plan with this stream.

975
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,590
I just it was a joke in pre stream chat like three days ago.

976
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,829
But now it's not a joke because guess what?

977
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,199
I hate when people do that.

978
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,739
Now it's not.

979
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:16,059
You know what?

980
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:16,460
You know what I'm saying?

981
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,780
You know what?

982
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,809
It's not a joke because I'm having a good time.

983
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:26,619
If the god is alerted to bees, do they take more damage?

984
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,739
No, it's not.

985
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:28,940
This game is not fucking realistic.

986
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,340
It sucks.

987
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,800
All I ask for is a little bit of realism.

988
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,320
Like actual like bullet damage and like cut damage and stuff.

989
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,099
And actual like body damage to the cars and stuff like that.

990
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:49,260
That's not bad.

991
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,659
All right.

992
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:49,980
Yeah.

993
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,539
Put him right.

994
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:51,340
Put him in the tower.

995
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,500
Good.

996
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:56,590
What are they doing over here?

997
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:02,940
Why are you doing all this, man?

998
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,039
Fuck.

999
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:18,699
Don't let her kill me.

1000
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:24,940
That's not based of you.

1001
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:29,340
Worst stream of 2020.

1002
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,579
That is a game.

1003
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:31,900
All right.

1004
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:34,460
A gaming stream.

1005
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,500
A gaming stream.

1006
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,889
I'm just playing a game.

1007
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:41,409
Well, I can't play a game on stream.

1008
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,090
And I've been playing a game poorly.

1009
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,369
I'm 4 and 0.

1010
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:45,650
Excuse me.

1011
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,579
Are we going to calculate stream poor like levels of poor quality based on video game playing?

1012
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:14,429
Keep it up.

1013
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,800
Yeah, I actually really like that character.

1014
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,699
Um, wow.

1015
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,760
This gives me nostalgia to the old smite videos.

1016
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:32,420
I actually really enjoyed this game a lot.

1017
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,309
Used to play this game.

1018
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:39,949
Oh, yeah.

1019
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,949
Back in the like technical alpha.

1020
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:42,590
Whatever it was.

1021
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,630
I played this game all the time.

1022
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,789
Uh, I don't you know, it's funny.

1023
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,150
I only pick these three.

1024
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,389
I don't even know what the other items even do.

1025
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,070
In the years that I've played this game, I've never scrolled over them.

1026
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:02,099
Back in the MLC stealth days.

1027
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,219
Yeah, you wanted something crazy.

1028
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,380
I mean, maybe some of the newer um, newer viewers might not know this.

1029
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:08,980
Uh, so I had a friend.

1030
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,059
We used to make videos and shit all the time.

1031
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,659
MLC stealth.

1032
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,699
The guy and his team.

1033
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,460
They were all really good at the game.

1034
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,619
They won two and a half million fucking dollars playing this game.

1035
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:25,780
During like the first smite world championship.

1036
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,380
I remember watching it.

1037
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:35,519
It was insane.

1038
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,880
That's the only time that I really ever cared about esports stuff.

1039
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,079
Really, to be honest.

1040
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,440
It was just like, oh my god.

1041
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,960
This guy's gonna, this team is gonna win fucking millions.

1042
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:55,420
Got him.

1043
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:04,579
That's pocket change.

1044
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:07,090
What planet are you from?

1045
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:07,590
What?

1046
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1047
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,280
All right.

1048
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,079
Group up.

1049
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:23,730
See those auto attacks?

1050
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,690
They're so deadly.

1051
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:24,929
All right.

1052
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:28,369
I just don't, at some point when you play moves and cop, you know, you don't even do moves anymore.

1053
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:29,090
Why, what am I doing?

1054
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,880
You just have to be good at landing shots.

1055
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,039
Which I'm obviously not very good at right now.

1056
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,929
Don't silence me.

1057
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:44,449
Okay.

1058
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:53,099
Is that mostly still the pro esports man now?

1059
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:53,599
No.

1060
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,199
I'm fairly certain that they won that tournament.

1061
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:00,449
And then I think he started working for high res.

1062
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:01,730
He works for, he's working for high res.

1063
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:05,420
It's a very interesting story.

1064
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:14,059
How do you set a stream to times two speed?

1065
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,769
You wait until about six to seven hours from now.

1066
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,809
There'll be a clickable video that you can click on.

1067
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,699
Oh, you know, you can't even do that on a VOD, can you?

1068
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:33,300
Oh, that hurts.

1069
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:35,139
Oh, that hurts too.

1070
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:43,250
You're gonna play for seven hours?

1071
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,730
I don't know.

1072
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,369
I don't have a plan.

1073
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:55,579
Ah, no.

1074
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,650
Losing subscribers, losing subscribers.

1075
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,769
No, don't, don't do that.

1076
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,480
Definitely want this.

1077
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,599
I want to just be a machine gun.

1078
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,400
Then I got to get the crits.

1079
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:24,429
Tack speed baloney?

1080
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:26,030
What's the tack speed baloney?

1081
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:32,829
We put you in the top 100 list and we can take you out of it.

1082
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:35,489
Yeah.

1083
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:39,250
Yeah, no, I, whatever.

1084
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,739
Tack speed Andy.

1085
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,800
Oh, this person's not happy with me.

1086
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,960
Oh my God.

1087
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,239
This person just dove to kill me.

1088
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,599
Holy shit.

1089
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,159
All of them dove.

1090
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:04,960
The whole team dove.

1091
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,150
Stream sniped.

1092
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,710
No, I, I highly doubt anybody's stream sniping.

1093
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,150
I really don't think so.

1094
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:27,949
I'd be shocked.

1095
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:39,280
I missed every fucking single shot.

1096
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,840
Come on, dude.

1097
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,869
What was that?

1098
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:43,309
That was weird lag.

1099
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,840
Once you start firing so fast,

1100
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,000
it's so easy just to like just miss everything.

1101
00:54:50,719 --> 00:55:02,480
Wait, silence even works for auto attacks?

1102
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:10,500
Watch out.

1103
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,440
Come on, hit him.

1104
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:28,210
I had to dive and kill that guy.

1105
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,409
That was embarrassing if I didn't.

1106
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:34,320
Press VVX.

1107
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:48,590
I don't understand what's going on in this game.

1108
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,150
I'll tell you.

1109
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,710
5v5 in an arena.

1110
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,869
This is not the regular game mode.

1111
00:55:55,869 --> 00:56:01,409
The regular game mode is more akin to something like League or Dota

1112
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:02,769
that you've probably seen a million times.

1113
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,280
This is just a for fun mode.

1114
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,320
It's a warm up mode.

1115
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,210
And I promise I will jungle.

1116
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:21,969
I will jungle in a conquest game if we do some viewer games, which we will.

1117
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:25,949
It's going to be embarrassing.

1118
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,389
I'm going to get probably really pissed off.

1119
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,469
It will play assault too.

1120
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,989
Don't worry if anyone wants to look.

1121
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:33,150
I know that if I open up to viewer games,

1122
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,429
I'm going to get absolutely stomped.

1123
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:36,989
That's fine.

1124
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,110
It's all right.

1125
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:38,750
We're just having fun.

1126
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:55,099
Now I'm just going to watch Omega Low.

1127
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,579
Ooh, that stings.

1128
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:06,139
So does that.

1129
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,570
All right, I got to go back.

1130
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:16,139
Sorry, my ego can get shattered.

1131
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,980
No, it doesn't.

1132
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,860
I don't care.

1133
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,820
I'm just fucking around.

1134
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,210
I'm just going to get every bow.

1135
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:27,730
No, what am I doing?

1136
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,769
Can I refund?

1137
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:30,909
I want to refund.

1138
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:32,030
All right, here we go.

1139
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:35,820
I want crit.

1140
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,019
Are you going to play DOS games in the future?

1141
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:42,500
Probably.

1142
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:44,400
I'm open to anything, man.

1143
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,179
Oh, fuck, that hurts.

1144
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:57,630
Oh, my God, get her off me.

1145
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,639
I think I'm all seven of that Belonis kills.

1146
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,949
Well, five.

1147
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:15,329
Mr. Jeremy, we politely ask for Germacraft

1148
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,610
to be played on this broadcast.

1149
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:21,969
We politely ask.

1150
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:27,710
Just we're going to win.

1151
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,590
We're good.

1152
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:35,900
10 years later, Belonis still OP.

1153
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,739
What even is the tier list look like nowadays?

1154
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,460
I have no idea.

1155
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,860
We could really easily fuck this up

1156
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,579
if we're not careful.

1157
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,239
All right, good.

1158
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,940
Yeah, Amuza Cup is weird

1159
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,900
because when you auto attack,

1160
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,739
it almost feels like it comes from the right shoulder,

1161
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,619
not right in front of you.

1162
00:58:57,139 --> 00:59:00,780
Should I unironically get into this game?

1163
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,539
That depends.

1164
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,900
Do you like a MOBA that is a third person perspective?

1165
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:08,670
That's not click to move.

1166
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,630
It's WASD.

1167
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,420
I mean, that's up to you.

1168
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:15,809
Bull is the best hunter.

1169
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:21,059
Well, yeah, you have to stop at that first sentence.

1170
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,579
Do you want a MOBA?

1171
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:24,500
Don't say anything else.

1172
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:32,590
All right, we'll do one more of these

1173
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,469
and then I'm going to do,

1174
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,590
we'll do some assault viewer games

1175
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,039
so I can warm up.

1176
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,150
You still get the TMNT skins.

1177
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:43,949
I think you can.

1178
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:52,059
I'm pretty sure you need to be level 15 for assault.

1179
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,579
Not if you do a custom game.

1180
00:59:54,139 --> 01:00:01,599
I can just create a custom game.

1181
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,679
That means it's just people in this chat.

1182
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:09,329
Weren't there avatar skins?

1183
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,369
Yeah, they added so many skins to this game.

1184
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:13,730
It's hard to even keep track.

1185
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,809
I see screenshots of skins

1186
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:19,389
and think they are other characters.

1187
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:22,019
It's not just skins anymore.

1188
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,380
It's like, I don't even know.

1189
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,900
Okay, I know Aang is in the game,

1190
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,460
but I have no fucking idea what character he is.

1191
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,420
I have no idea.

1192
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:36,079
All right, what am I going to play?

1193
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,199
Merlin, okay.

1194
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:45,360
All right, we got tank, image, mage.

1195
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,880
Oh, no, I have to play the tank.

1196
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,519
All right.

1197
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:48,320
Oh, no.

1198
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,469
Should I?

1199
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:53,630
All right, he's flipping back and forth

1200
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,349
showing that he's willing to play tank or damage.

1201
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:57,840
What should I do?

1202
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,710
Play Ymir?

1203
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,289
No, Anubis?

1204
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,409
All right, I'm going to play Bacchus?

1205
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:11,920
Bracken?

1206
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,760
Shit, I hate being the last person to pick.

1207
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,739
Everyone just sitting there tapping their foot for me.

1208
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,340
All right, I'm going to play as Cthulhu.

1209
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:20,980
All right.

1210
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:33,710
I don't know how to play Cthulhu.

1211
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,989
You're going to play Darkest Dungeon 2?

1212
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:35,469
Absolutely.

1213
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,969
Is Cthulhu a tank, a guardian, or is he a war?

1214
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:44,610
What is he?

1215
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:51,329
I think he's a guardian, right?

1216
01:01:51,329 --> 01:02:00,750
This is epic.

1217
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:07,730
You're going to play a game, Zooted, on stream?

1218
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,800
I stopped doing that when I couldn't read

1219
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,239
an analog clock on camera.

1220
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:15,619
That was the last time I believe I did that.

1221
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:19,119
All right, what do they got?

1222
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,630
Physical, magical, physical, magical.

1223
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:27,230
All right, we need magic.

1224
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:28,349
We need magic protection.

1225
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:31,059
Go.

1226
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:32,380
Good.

1227
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,960
Now let's play a game called, how do you play Cthulhu?

1228
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,420
All right, this is too much reading.

1229
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,380
It's too much.

1230
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,260
Damage sends out a terrifying blast of energy.

1231
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
It does damage and reduces stuff.

1232
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:49,619
Ground target.

1233
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:51,699
Cthulhu summons a portal, creating a slowing field

1234
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:53,780
of Eldritch Mire at the target location.

1235
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:56,989
While Cthulhu channels, the Mire continues to grow as a portal.

1236
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:59,230
Fires out two massive eruptions, but it does damage.

1237
01:02:59,230 --> 01:02:59,730
Okay.

1238
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,900
It's a dash.

1239
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,219
Cthulhu creates two twisting projectiles at his side.

1240
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:06,780
Is there a button I can press where it just tells me

1241
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,059
what the move does?

1242
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:11,500
I don't like when the lore is inside of the explanation

1243
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,719
of the move.

1244
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,960
I know I get it, but I want a distinct,

1245
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,110
just press a button and tell me what it does.

1246
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:23,869
Dash, and this is a stim.

1247
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:24,429
True form.

1248
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:25,230
All right, let's go.

1249
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:41,440
He's so slow.

1250
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,639
I don't know, I'm just going in.

1251
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:43,199
I'm just diving.

1252
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,250
I don't know what any of those moves did,

1253
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,280
but I think I heard somebody.

1254
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,239
Just press buttons.

1255
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:54,639
You can't street fighter.

1256
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,000
What am I doing?

1257
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,650
Oh my God, it worked.

1258
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,460
I'm dead.

1259
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:05,179
You can't play a MOBA and use the street fighter

1260
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,619
button mash concept.

1261
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:08,380
It doesn't work like that.

1262
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:17,900
With Cthulhu, you literally mash buttons.

1263
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:26,139
All right, should I just alt in?

1264
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,000
Holy shit.

1265
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,059
So that's what this thing is.

1266
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,219
Does he have moves?

1267
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:39,179
This feels unfair.

1268
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,480
Holy shit, that's insane.

1269
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,420
What am I doing?

1270
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,150
Oh no.

1271
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,349
Oh no, I'm going to be feeding.

1272
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:57,230
This is bad.

1273
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,030
Oh, this is not good.

1274
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,469
If there's a time where you can feed

1275
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:08,590
and not be feel bad about it,

1276
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:18,239
it's probably arena.

1277
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:19,360
Just blame your team.

1278
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,289
You want me to dive the tower and then say,

1279
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:25,420
you rock, you rock, you rock.

1280
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:27,579
You rock, you rock.

1281
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:28,780
I don't do that shit.

1282
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,139
Don't be annoying.

1283
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,059
Oh, somebody's doing it.

1284
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:36,780
Wait, they're doing it.

1285
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,619
Oh, wait, this person was doing it?

1286
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:39,579
No, they weren't.

1287
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:43,409
Oh, they're watching the stream.

1288
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:53,260
So what does the best?

1289
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,139
Okay, that's pretty good.

1290
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,039
I got to get up in there.

1291
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,960
Oh, they killed that guy.

1292
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:17,409
That was all right.

1293
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:18,130
V-E-R.

1294
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:20,750
Oh no, I didn't want to do that.

1295
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:27,550
Stay in.

1296
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,030
Let's stay in.

1297
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, get out.

1298
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,480
Everybody out.

1299
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,320
Everybody get out.

1300
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,769
Everybody get out.

1301
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:39,460
Shit.

1302
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:49,219
They were V-R-R.

1303
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:52,800
Now that's a little late.

1304
01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:04,639
I can see why people think he's fun.

1305
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,289
He's just like a huge slug guy

1306
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:09,809
that can grow 50 feet tall.

1307
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,179
So this is arena.

1308
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:15,340
I wonder how awful it is to play with

1309
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,059
against a Cthulhu in the regular game mode.

1310
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:19,019
He takes up the whole screen.

1311
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:21,730
Wouldn't that be awful in a team fight?

1312
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:26,429
Oh, fuck it.

1313
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:26,829
Let's go.

1314
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:36,139
You still in?

1315
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,579
All right.

1316
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:41,139
Nice.

1317
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:41,539
Good job.

1318
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:50,380
You're big.

1319
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,260
You don't have to do shit.

1320
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, I have to go back.

1321
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,739
Cthulhu is not actually that amazing.

1322
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:02,610
Please pick a different character

1323
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:03,889
that's not so scary.

1324
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,659
Probably cooldown, right?

1325
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,820
Who's doing all the damage?

1326
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,500
There's only like two people

1327
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,380
that are physical on the whole team.

1328
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:15,699
Whatever.

1329
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,829
If you build him correctly,

1330
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:21,630
he hits really hard.

1331
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:29,760
Get over here.

1332
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:31,899
Yeah.

1333
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:38,800
Oh, shit.

1334
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,520
This guy's pretty low.

1335
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:45,859
You just fucked over the Ra?

1336
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:51,970
Where'd he go?

1337
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,539
Is he dead?

1338
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,890
Ra, you got to get out of here.

1339
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,289
Run away.

1340
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,340
Ra, you got to get out of here.

1341
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,659
Get out of here.

1342
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:59,220
You got to get out of here.

1343
01:08:59,220 --> 01:08:59,859
Get out of here.

1344
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:00,420
Get out of here.

1345
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,340
Ra, you got to get out of here.

1346
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:08,699
No, I shouldn't.

1347
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:09,420
I don't want to stand in that.

1348
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,899
It's not mine.

1349
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,869
Sorry.

1350
01:09:13,869 --> 01:09:14,350
I'm the tank.

1351
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:14,909
I'm supposed to die.

1352
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,039
That hurt my ears.

1353
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:31,760
Sorry.

1354
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,670
I was doing the walrus.

1355
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:43,069
Does he have a...

1356
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:43,470
He does.

1357
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:43,710
Okay.

1358
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,750
It's a three-hit combo.

1359
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,670
It's one, two, three, and a cone.

1360
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:47,949
Damn, that's good.

1361
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:58,109
We need everybody here.

1362
01:09:58,109 --> 01:09:58,989
There's only three of us here.

1363
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,069
I need another coffee, man.

1364
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:02,510
I need another coffee, man.

1365
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,710
I'm going in once we get here.

1366
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,159
When the Ares pulls everybody,

1367
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:22,720
that's when I'm going to go in.

1368
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,199
Oh, shit.

1369
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:23,680
They're going in.

1370
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:24,560
Oh, shit.

1371
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,039
He's going in.

1372
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,739
Oh, okay.

1373
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:28,699
All right.

1374
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:42,109
All right.

1375
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:42,430
We did it.

1376
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:43,470
Nice work.

1377
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:48,670
Oh, shit.

1378
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:50,189
No, back up, back up, back up.

1379
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:50,590
Run away.

1380
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,890
You can tell he's stoned.

1381
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:56,289
I'm not...

1382
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:57,489
Why would I do that and play Smite?

1383
01:10:57,489 --> 01:10:58,130
Are you kidding me?

1384
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:00,800
I'd get stuck in the menu.

1385
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:05,760
People are like,

1386
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,079
what do you mean?

1387
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,039
Like, question mark, question mark.

1388
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:08,159
Let me ask you something.

1389
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:10,640
I don't know why this is a trend

1390
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,000
in current video games,

1391
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,439
especially in mobile games.

1392
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:14,960
I'm not calling Smite a mobile game,

1393
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,319
but holy shit.

1394
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:19,409
Do we need to have

1395
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,970
like 30 sub menus

1396
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:23,250
throughout the course of the game's menu?

1397
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,960
There's like 15 different like things

1398
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,399
to purchase and bundles,

1399
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,600
and you get like a bunch of ads

1400
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,119
pop up of different chests

1401
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,560
and bundles and packs,

1402
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,250
and I don't even know where to start.

1403
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,539
I remember I played a mobile game one time

1404
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,380
and I'm not kidding.

1405
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,939
When I got to the game's main screen,

1406
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,300
where it's like, okay, time to play.

1407
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,140
I think like eight different pop ups

1408
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,420
happened before I was actually able

1409
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,220
to even see the menu,

1410
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,060
and the menu is a fucking mess.

1411
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,079
Just like 12 red exclamation marks

1412
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:05,920
across eight different,

1413
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,199
five different menus,

1414
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:08,479
12 different menus.

1415
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:10,560
It's like, I don't want this on my screen,

1416
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,380
and you have to click the fucking thing

1417
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,859
to get the red exclamation mark to go away.

1418
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,140
It's like, I don't want any red exclamation,

1419
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,100
make them all go away.

1420
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:24,319
And then sometimes you have to find

1421
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,800
where the red exclamation mark even is.

1422
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,970
It's like, oh, I have a red exclamation

1423
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:30,770
in achievements.

1424
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:33,329
Okay, I clicked achievements.

1425
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,229
Okay, now you have to scroll

1426
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:37,470
and find the fucking achievement it is

1427
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,909
and click it and look at it

1428
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:39,630
before it goes away.

1429
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:44,100
What is going on here?

1430
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,739
Holy shit, that was a good snipe.

1431
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:54,220
Nice job.

1432
01:12:54,779 --> 01:13:00,829
We got this big guy.

1433
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:05,329
Get some damage.

1434
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:06,770
I have no idea how to play this character.

1435
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,329
I'm terrified.

1436
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,010
I'm just going to play only

1437
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,369
to just straight up damage sync.

1438
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,180
I'm just taking damage for no reason.

1439
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:19,789
Can you play League of Legends?

1440
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:21,149
No, that's different.

1441
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:26,369
It was one game that I considered playing

1442
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:27,569
back in the day.

1443
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,689
It was Han, Heroes of North.

1444
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:32,319
Why is that, you ask?

1445
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,489
I cannot stand, cannot stand it

1446
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,140
when a game has click delay to move.

1447
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,000
Han did not have click delay.

1448
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,079
When you clicked, you moved instantly.

1449
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:45,119
Your character turned.

1450
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,920
I don't like the like one half second,

1451
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,199
a full second delay

1452
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,319
when you click to go somewhere.

1453
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:51,199
I hate it.

1454
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,989
That's why I play this.

1455
01:13:54,989 --> 01:13:58,560
All right, I think we're going to go

1456
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,119
in a second here.

1457
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,979
League doesn't have that.

1458
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:09,140
League has, I think, the biggest click delay

1459
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,579
out of all the games.

1460
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:11,920
Let's go.

1461
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:19,600
I don't even know what these moves do,

1462
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:33,300
but I'm doing them.

1463
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,180
Oh, shit.

1464
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:34,739
All right, let's go.

1465
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:35,220
Everyone leave.

1466
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:42,739
League is instant?

1467
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:45,920
League is not instant.

1468
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:52,369
Run away.

1469
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:53,409
Oh, that might kill him.

1470
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,229
You didn't do any damage.

1471
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,109
You overextended.

1472
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,539
League is instant.

1473
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,220
That has to be new.

1474
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:18,779
What's the click delay in League?

1475
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,460
You had bad internet.

1476
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:21,579
No, I didn't.

1477
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:22,460
My internet was fine.

1478
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:27,180
All right, fuck it.

1479
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:34,779
Let's go in.

1480
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:36,060
Not too far in.

1481
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,239
All right, everyone back out.

1482
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:41,600
Whoa.

1483
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:46,699
It's instant.

1484
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:47,819
Always has been.

1485
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:51,550
You're thinking of Dota.

1486
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:54,420
It's not delay.

1487
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,300
It's turn speed.

1488
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,340
Well, whatever the hell it is.

1489
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,109
When I right, when I click to move in those games,

1490
01:16:00,109 --> 01:16:01,710
they don't move there immediately.

1491
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,069
They like have to take a second

1492
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:06,640
and then they move on was not like that.

1493
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:14,960
And I'm talking like I was some big player

1494
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:15,760
of Heroes of New Earth.

1495
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,770
I played it maybe for 15 minutes and said,

1496
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:19,729
no, I don't want to do this.

1497
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:31,779
Ooh, they.

1498
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,479
All right, all right, all right.

1499
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:35,119
I'm in a minute.

1500
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:35,439
I'm in.

1501
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:36,000
Let's go, let's go.

1502
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:40,130
Just break it all up.

1503
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,170
Just be a fucking nuisance.

1504
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:41,890
That's what I'm supposed to do.

1505
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,449
All right, retreat.

1506
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:42,850
You got it.

1507
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:49,680
He's really cool.

1508
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:52,159
This is definitely a little brother character, by the way.

1509
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,720
Absolutely.

1510
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,079
You want to play spite with your little brother,

1511
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,760
have them pick Cthulhu and build only tank items.

1512
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:01,920
And they're not doing anything.

1513
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,520
They're just kind of a nuisance in the way,

1514
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,880
but like they're going to be alive.

1515
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,439
They'll be okay.

1516
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:15,119
And they get to get huge.

1517
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:16,560
Like, oh, I'm huge.

1518
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,060
You could be like, oh, there you go.

1519
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,409
Mike, there you go, Michael.

1520
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:25,470
Oh, you got that guy.

1521
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,270
You got that guy.

1522
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,510
And you do player damage and he did one damage.

1523
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:36,880
Oh, shit.

1524
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,159
We're really kind of tearing it up here.

1525
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:47,680
BM, BM, BM, BM, BM, BM, fucking BM.

1526
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:53,100
That's so stupid.

1527
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:58,579
Imagine hearing that over voice chat.

1528
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:00,100
I turn on voice chat.

1529
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,539
BM, BM, dude, get the fuck in there.

1530
01:18:01,539 --> 01:18:02,100
BM.

1531
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,720
It's like, relax, man.

1532
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,390
I need physical.

1533
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:17,680
Actually, really shouldn't have done that.

1534
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,600
Because this is a pretty close game.

1535
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,680
Why do I think we were really running away with it there?

1536
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,079
We weren't.

1537
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:28,640
What the hell are these stupid rings?

1538
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,359
These fucking Sonic the Hedgehog rings.

1539
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:32,960
I've stopped so I'm not going to swear anymore.

1540
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,329
What the fuck is going on?

1541
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:35,649
All right.

1542
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:36,609
What is happening?

1543
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:37,109
Why?

1544
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:46,720
No.

1545
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:54,930
All right.

1546
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,020
I got to let it be known that me and that rod just saved the day.

1547
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,920
Is Sonic and Smite?

1548
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,319
I don't know.

1549
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,510
No, Sonic is not Nickelodeon.

1550
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:17,119
There it is.

1551
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:19,569
Nice work, everybody.

1552
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:24,460
Oops, that's the wrong one.

1553
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,340
I want to say you rock.

1554
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:30,289
Who's your main?

1555
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:31,810
I really don't have one.

1556
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:41,539
I'm going to give teamwork to the raw.

1557
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,180
Because that was a very clutch moment in the very end.

1558
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:45,680
I'm going to burp.

1559
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,260
All right.

1560
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,800
So now, let's see how this works.

1561
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:00,619
So if I go to play, and I go to custom, okay.

1562
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:01,979
And I go to create match.

1563
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:06,899
Match type, assault.

1564
01:20:06,899 --> 01:20:08,020
Let's do an assault.

1565
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,140
Team size 5v5.

1566
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:12,340
Player pick, there is no...

1567
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,060
It's random pick.

1568
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,020
It's assault.

1569
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:14,939
Starting level.

1570
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:15,739
What level did you start at?

1571
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:16,859
Start at five?

1572
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:22,159
I think you start at level five, don't you?

1573
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:22,800
Yeah.

1574
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,640
How much gold do you start with in assault?

1575
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,020
1,500?

1576
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,329
Pause type, no.

1577
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:29,729
None.

1578
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:31,250
I'm not going to let anybody just ruin the game

1579
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,689
by just pausing over and over again.

1580
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:33,489
It's 3k.

1581
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:37,949
Start with 100,000.

1582
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:39,470
No, we'll do that later.

1583
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:44,609
Have you seen the handsome edits of you recently?

1584
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:48,399
I've seen the handsome photos.

1585
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:48,880
I haven't seen...

1586
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,600
What do you mean, edits?

1587
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,619
Lane minions, North America, no.

1588
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,779
And low latency, low delay, spectate mode, no.

1589
01:20:58,779 --> 01:21:00,659
No spectators.

1590
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:01,699
No one's doing that.

1591
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:07,359
You're going to fucking like kill the server, okay?

1592
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,279
Password.

1593
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,699
All right, this is where...

1594
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:13,100
I got to...

1595
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,569
Okay, I got to turn the screen off, right?

1596
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:20,319
Screen has to go off.

1597
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,260
Great match.

1598
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:32,960
All right, so the password, you can't see it.

1599
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:42,930
I got to remember the password because it's grayed out.

1600
01:21:43,489 --> 01:21:51,760
Okay, great match.

1601
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:56,989
All right, so you ready?

1602
01:21:56,989 --> 01:22:00,180
We're doing assault.

1603
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,090
The password is...

1604
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:11,380
Hello there.

1605
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:18,859
No spaces, no capitals.

1606
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:19,899
Didn't take very long at all.

1607
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:25,859
What are these?

1608
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:26,340
These are cool.

1609
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,539
Where'd you get these?

1610
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:33,550
I have what is the equivalent of the Twitter egg.

1611
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:36,109
All right, you guys ready?

1612
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:38,100
Let's go.

1613
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:49,680
I can do Neath.

1614
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,439
I can do Neath, but I remember a little bit.

1615
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,020
Northeast?

1616
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:06,500
What?

1617
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,180
Is this TOS?

1618
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:10,060
What, the character?

1619
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:12,220
What are you talking about?

1620
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,899
Do I have some good players on my team?

1621
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,579
I'm going to get shit on.

1622
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:18,140
I really am.

1623
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:26,430
Why are people saying TOS?

1624
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:27,390
Because I have Neath.

1625
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,350
It's not Neath the character?

1626
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,710
What are you talking about then?

1627
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:34,270
I don't know.

1628
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:35,310
How much is this?

1629
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,979
1,200 gems.

1630
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:44,220
You need to click this.

1631
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:44,779
Hold on.

1632
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:47,180
I'm in the middle of a smite game.

1633
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,819
Just relax.

1634
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:54,460
This is not the game to watch videos in the middle of a game.

1635
01:24:06,579 --> 01:24:15,810
Remember TF2 added a snake.

1636
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:16,449
Come back.

1637
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:21,659
Is this a pizza?

1638
01:24:21,659 --> 01:24:24,140
All right, I'm playing with people that are very good at the game,

1639
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:24,699
I would assume.

1640
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,060
So I have to be careful.

1641
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,609
Watch this shit.

1642
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:36,289
I'm going to scare the absolute shit out of somebody.

1643
01:24:36,289 --> 01:24:38,029
What does she have?

1644
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:38,829
She has the backflip.

1645
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,430
I don't even know what that was.

1646
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:41,550
Okay, I forget her moves.

1647
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:42,189
Whatever.

1648
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:44,020
Let's just shoot.

1649
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,979
She's a damage carrier.

1650
01:24:45,979 --> 01:24:48,539
That's fine.

1651
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:49,579
I want life steal first.

1652
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,539
And then potions are very important right now.

1653
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,329
And potions.

1654
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,229
Oh boy.

1655
01:24:59,869 --> 01:25:02,960
Why does that feel like it's lagging?

1656
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,829
Don't forget the relic.

1657
01:25:06,829 --> 01:25:07,310
Oh dear.

1658
01:25:08,029 --> 01:25:13,329
No, why is that lagging?

1659
01:25:13,329 --> 01:25:26,189
It's not.

1660
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:27,069
It's just turn speed.

1661
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:29,859
They're going to die at the tower, right?

1662
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:30,579
Like they're going to.

1663
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:34,529
Doesn't she have like an explosion thing where she shoots?

1664
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:38,720
Whoa.

1665
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,899
All right, this is viewer games.

1666
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,979
Why did I do that?

1667
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,569
I just panicked because we're playing against players that know what they're doing.

1668
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,390
Oh, B.M. B.M. B.M.

1669
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:12,300
Oh, that guy's.

1670
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:12,939
That guy dead?

1671
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,390
Oh shit, we have to shoot him like three times.

1672
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:22,609
Don't think I fucking knew how to do that, did you?

1673
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:27,920
If only I had my ult.

1674
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:39,100
B.M. B.M. B.M. B.M. B.M.

1675
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:45,630
That's not B.M.

1676
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:46,750
That's like what you do.

1677
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:58,670
What the fuck is B.M.?

1678
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,140
It stands for bowel movement.

1679
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:16,930
Or actually bad manners is the other one.

1680
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:17,409
Good job.

1681
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:19,729
Not really.

1682
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:21,859
Shit.

1683
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:22,500
Oh, I got it.

1684
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:24,619
Oh no, this is.

1685
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:25,180
They're going in.

1686
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:25,899
No, they're not.

1687
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:26,699
Oh god, run away.

1688
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:34,850
Oh my.

1689
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,710
What?

1690
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,880
Somebody just killed that guy in the middle of his sentence.

1691
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,720
Oh, he's so close.

1692
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:55,859
Boy, there's a jungle buff.

1693
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,060
Wait, I don't want to go in there.

1694
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:57,699
That's dangerous.

1695
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,319
Use your ult.

1696
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,060
I won't kill him if I do.

1697
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:16,640
Oh shit, you really.

1698
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,079
You thought you were really slick, didn't you?

1699
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,340
Oh god.

1700
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:34,479
I need mana, I need mana, I need mana.

1701
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:36,640
Mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana.

1702
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,439
Give me mana, give me mana.

1703
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,520
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1704
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:55,789
Oh, at that tower.

1705
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:56,590
We'll get it.

1706
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:01,779
Where'd he go?

1707
01:29:01,779 --> 01:29:06,909
Oh, up.

1708
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:07,630
Cool.

1709
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:17,020
We can get the tower right now.

1710
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,579
Shit.

1711
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:18,939
She's got a slow shot.

1712
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:24,130
Very nice.

1713
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:24,689
Good.

1714
01:29:24,689 --> 01:29:30,640
What do I, who do I got it?

1715
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,000
That weave through a few people.

1716
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,960
That was pretty good.

1717
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,159
It was actually not that great.

1718
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:42,539
That was a good little brother kill, I would say.

1719
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,310
Excuse me.

1720
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,399
We're just rolling here.

1721
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,949
Oh my god.

1722
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:03,840
Good little brother kill, says the little brother.

1723
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,880
Yeah, I mean that.

1724
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,760
I was the little brother.

1725
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,319
That's what I mean.

1726
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,119
That Neath ult was like a you would turn to your little brother

1727
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:10,159
and say nice job.

1728
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:10,640
You got him.

1729
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:21,220
Earth, Earth, Phoenix.

1730
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,100
This is not going to last very long.

1731
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:34,460
You know why that playing assault in viewer games is actually awesome?

1732
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,270
Because it truly doesn't matter.

1733
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:38,029
Because it's just five v five team fights.

1734
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:42,859
It doesn't, I'm not, there's no stream sniping right now.

1735
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:44,220
It's just a mess in the middle.

1736
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:45,420
This is great.

1737
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:57,170
I do need to go.

1738
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:58,529
I need mana and you can't get mana.

1739
01:30:58,529 --> 01:31:00,689
By the way, if you just don't know what's going on.

1740
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:04,449
I have to die to buy new items or get mana.

1741
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:06,770
So sometimes it's actually a pretty good technique just to die.

1742
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:27,890
Oh, got a guy back here, but it's always an awesome feeling.

1743
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,770
If you can complete a whole assault without going back one time.

1744
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:32,289
That's great.

1745
01:31:32,289 --> 01:31:33,170
Let's see if I can steal this.

1746
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:37,569
I don't determine.

1747
01:31:37,569 --> 01:31:40,800
Hey, thank you.

1748
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,710
What?

1749
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:51,060
Did I miss something?

1750
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:58,829
Oh, that is just being weird.

1751
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:06,500
Oh, yeah, this is, I might not have to go back once.

1752
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,420
I'm getting Omega carried.

1753
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:16,529
That was weird.

1754
01:32:25,149 --> 01:32:25,710
All right, that's fine.

1755
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,270
I'm going to die here.

1756
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:29,859
See if I can just eat some hits.

1757
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:35,649
That's fine.

1758
01:32:35,649 --> 01:32:36,689
All right, now I can spend money.

1759
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,020
Lifesteal, lifesteal.

1760
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:39,659
I want lifesteal.

1761
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:51,250
This one.

1762
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:52,960
No, never mind.

1763
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,840
The attack speed.

1764
01:32:53,840 --> 01:33:03,180
Yeah, and this one and potions.

1765
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:12,850
Found it offline.

1766
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:19,260
You know, oh, shit, I forgot.

1767
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:19,659
No, it's all right.

1768
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:20,859
I got a meditation.

1769
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:21,180
I'm good.

1770
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:21,659
I'll be good.

1771
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,180
Purple potion.

1772
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,779
They made a purple potion.

1773
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:31,119
When did he say he was playing smite?

1774
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:33,489
I haven't checked.

1775
01:33:33,489 --> 01:33:35,329
Well, if you probably haven't been on the stream for a while.

1776
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:39,729
I actually became like a pretty much full-time smite streamer.

1777
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:44,270
Just doing some viewer games hanging out in between kind of competitive matches.

1778
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,359
Did I kill that person?

1779
01:33:55,359 --> 01:33:55,840
I hope so.

1780
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:03,659
Oh, oh, my God.

1781
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:05,899
I can't believe I did not die.

1782
01:34:05,899 --> 01:34:06,699
You got to be kidding me.

1783
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:16,560
This could be the end right here.

1784
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,670
We're going to get the phoenix at least.

1785
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:32,220
Yeah, that's it.

1786
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:40,750
We might not kill the titan.

1787
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,300
We'll probably not going to kill the sitan,

1788
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,899
but we'll probably get the phoenix at least.

1789
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:45,939
Or I don't know.

1790
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:46,340
Maybe not.

1791
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:46,819
Let's find out.

1792
01:34:46,819 --> 01:34:48,819
Oh, boy, this is an explosion right here.

1793
01:34:49,539 --> 01:34:52,100
It's just narrating.

1794
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,739
I'm just shout casting my moves.

1795
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:59,739
I've noticed that when you play a game like this and you're streaming it,

1796
01:35:01,409 --> 01:35:06,449
like the concept of dead air is not a good concept as a streamer, as a broadcaster, right?

1797
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:13,539
So what ends up happening is you end up just saying what you just did for a move

1798
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:15,300
or say the move you're about to do.

1799
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:19,729
Got that one.

1800
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:21,409
All right, I got to move by one.

1801
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,699
See if I can get an ult here.

1802
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:25,300
As I'm not even saying any words.

1803
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:41,920
Oh, we're good.

1804
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,039
Don't you dare do it.

1805
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:43,600
I'm going to do it.

1806
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:45,460
I'm going to do it.

1807
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:53,090
I'm going to do it.

1808
01:35:59,470 --> 01:35:59,710
Hey.

1809
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:08,699
All right, kill the titan.

1810
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:09,819
Kill the titan.

1811
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:10,380
Nice job.

1812
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:12,380
Nice job.

1813
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,369
Oh, here it comes.

1814
01:36:18,369 --> 01:36:18,850
It's coming.

1815
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:23,439
Oh, GG, Jeremy.

1816
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:30,670
You got me into smite and I lost worlds four times.

1817
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:31,229
Oh, no.

1818
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,170
Hey, but you got to worlds.

1819
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:39,970
That's crazy.

1820
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:48,029
The VOD is going to get muted.

1821
01:36:48,029 --> 01:36:48,510
Oh, shit.

1822
01:36:49,149 --> 01:36:51,229
No, it's not.

1823
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:52,130
It's fine.

1824
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:52,449
All right.

1825
01:36:52,449 --> 01:36:59,699
Again, the link.

1826
01:36:59,699 --> 01:36:59,859
All right.

1827
01:36:59,859 --> 01:37:01,220
What the hell do you want me to click on?

1828
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:02,739
What is wrong with you guys?

1829
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:09,539
What's wrong with you guys?

1830
01:37:09,539 --> 01:37:18,210
This is it, I think.

1831
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:18,689
What is this?

1832
01:37:19,489 --> 01:37:25,680
This is called Derma Unedited to Andy.

1833
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,680
Why does this have 80,000 views?

1834
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,739
This has 80,000 views.

1835
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:34,779
It has more views than like a video on the second channel.

1836
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:38,130
Is this...

1837
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:44,859
Am I going to get DMCA for this?

1838
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:45,260
Find out.

1839
01:37:55,810 --> 01:38:00,659
Derma is ugly.

1840
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:07,460
All right.

1841
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:09,489
Well, I guess we're going to play it.

1842
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:13,329
Derma is ugly.

1843
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:19,579
Let's see what it is.

1844
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,550
John McAfee.

1845
01:38:56,029 --> 01:38:59,630
Okay.

1846
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,960
Well, thanks for the video.

1847
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,079
I appreciate it.

1848
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:07,470
Thank you.

1849
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:09,840
That was a good video.

1850
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:14,189
Let's go ahead and do this again.

1851
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,350
Do another assault.

1852
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,949
Five to five, same thing.

1853
01:39:19,949 --> 01:39:23,359
We're going to do a game of conquest, too.

1854
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:24,239
And I'm going to...

1855
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,359
It's going to be bad.

1856
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:29,359
Okay, random pick.

1857
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:30,159
No pausing.

1858
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,270
Get out of here.

1859
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:34,029
Don't allow spectators.

1860
01:39:34,029 --> 01:39:35,149
And the password is...

1861
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:39,920
Well, it's like blocked out anyway, so you don't know.

1862
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,079
Wrong game mode?

1863
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:45,279
Oh, shit.

1864
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:47,630
All right.

1865
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:48,590
Password is going to be...

1866
01:39:49,310 --> 01:40:01,729
How do I spell this?

1867
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:04,100
All right.

1868
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:04,579
Let's go.

1869
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:07,539
Password is...

1870
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:09,140
I will tell you.

1871
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:11,899
Make us guess the password.

1872
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:19,819
The password's Aaron, okay?

1873
01:40:19,819 --> 01:40:21,979
Yeah, I guess you guys got it before saying anything.

1874
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:22,939
What?

1875
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:23,260
All right.

1876
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,460
Well, good job.

1877
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:24,939
Let's go.

1878
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,189
It was Aaron.

1879
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:36,189
How do I...

1880
01:40:36,189 --> 01:40:37,550
I forget how you play, Agni.

1881
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:40,529
I can probably do it, though.

1882
01:40:40,529 --> 01:40:42,689
You just do the gigantic meteors on people?

1883
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:47,460
Say it.

1884
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:48,260
Say what?

1885
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:51,920
Thank you for Smite Thursdays.

1886
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,319
You're the best.

1887
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:53,920
Hope to see more content like this soon.

1888
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,159
Oh, my God.

1889
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,439
I completely fucking forgot.

1890
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:03,760
I completely forgot.

1891
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,399
I have to tweet this out, I think.

1892
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:07,340
But...

1893
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:08,539
So, I was...

1894
01:41:09,579 --> 01:41:11,100
This is a long story.

1895
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:13,539
Okay, this is going to have to be after the...

1896
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:15,409
Yeah.

1897
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:17,649
This is going to have to be after the match here.

1898
01:41:17,649 --> 01:41:23,090
This is a long story.

1899
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:34,850
Yeah, we'll talk about this later.

1900
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:35,489
Do it during...

1901
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:35,970
No, I can't.

1902
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:39,569
After this match, I'm going to take a second and I'm going to show you.

1903
01:41:39,569 --> 01:41:44,930
So, I was a little high.

1904
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:47,010
I was, you know, just did a little bit.

1905
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,180
A couple nights, maybe a few nights ago, maybe.

1906
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:51,380
I don't remember exactly what it was.

1907
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:53,869
I was a little...

1908
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:55,949
And so, I did something.

1909
01:41:55,949 --> 01:42:00,050
I did something weird that it's hard for me to explain.

1910
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:03,170
A few days later, I'm thinking back.

1911
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:06,289
And what was the point of me doing this is the question that I had.

1912
01:42:07,649 --> 01:42:09,329
It's a long, embarrassing story.

1913
01:42:09,329 --> 01:42:12,000
So, I'll tell you after this.

1914
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,409
What do I want to do for moves?

1915
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:17,890
What do these do?

1916
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,250
All right, that's the dash.

1917
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:21,100
That's the fire.

1918
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:21,739
Probably the fire.

1919
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:28,819
Don't do that shit in the streamer's ear.

1920
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:31,550
Don't do that in the streamer's ear.

1921
01:42:39,739 --> 01:42:40,779
It's not even embarrassing.

1922
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:42,979
It's just like...

1923
01:42:42,979 --> 01:42:44,819
At this point, you guys should expect it.

1924
01:42:44,819 --> 01:42:55,229
All right, so it's the...

1925
01:42:55,229 --> 01:42:57,199
You get four of these, right?

1926
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:59,439
And you really want to put the gas down.

1927
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:00,800
Because there is gas.

1928
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,039
You put the gas down, you ignite them.

1929
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:03,600
And then you go...

1930
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,109
You throw up no more Oreos?

1931
01:43:10,109 --> 01:43:10,510
No.

1932
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,220
Let me see if I can describe this.

1933
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,500
So, I played...

1934
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:14,899
I don't...

1935
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:19,420
When I'm lying in bed, sometimes I do things

1936
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,460
that are just a way for me to pass some time

1937
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,539
before falling asleep and just relaxing.

1938
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:26,859
And having the iPad in bed is very, very easy.

1939
01:43:26,859 --> 01:43:28,819
There's also an app store.

1940
01:43:28,819 --> 01:43:32,020
And I download and play just random shit all the time.

1941
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,100
Even if it's stupid, even if it sucks.

1942
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:34,979
It doesn't matter.

1943
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:36,100
It doesn't matter what the game is.

1944
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,340
If it's new on the app store, I usually get it and just go,

1945
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,100
oh, okay, play for 10 minutes.

1946
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,060
And then fall asleep.

1947
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:45,630
So, I downloaded Cookie Run Kingdom.

1948
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:50,180
Because Cookie Run Kingdom did this thing

1949
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:55,520
where they hired every North American voice actor ever

1950
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,920
to be a hundred characters in the game.

1951
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,880
And I was like, what the fuck?

1952
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,520
That's crazy.

1953
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:02,960
So, I downloaded it and I played it.

1954
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:08,000
Remember, I had had a little bit of THC, right?

1955
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,710
Hold on a second.

1956
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:10,590
I gotta fuck shit up.

1957
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:13,119
Hold on a second.

1958
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,079
Let me just fuck shit up.

1959
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:19,439
Oh, let me just chill out a minute.

1960
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:24,369
So, I'm playing Cookie Run Kingdom.

1961
01:44:26,609 --> 01:44:29,890
And I thought of this idea.

1962
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:32,689
And I thought it was a brilliant idea.

1963
01:44:32,689 --> 01:44:37,119
I was like, holy shit, I have a great game, video game idea.

1964
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:43,199
And I opened up my notepad on my iPad and just started typing.

1965
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:47,220
And what I typed is bizarre.

1966
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,300
And I tried to break it down a little bit.

1967
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,939
And it's just truly weird what I wrote.

1968
01:44:51,939 --> 01:44:56,220
But this was my idea for a video game.

1969
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:01,020
And I took a screenshot of this to remember it.

1970
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:04,640
Not with the iPad, with my phone.

1971
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,439
I held my phone up to take a picture of the screen.

1972
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:15,729
So, I would remember it.

1973
01:45:15,729 --> 01:45:16,930
How high were you?

1974
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:17,729
Not really.

1975
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:19,329
It was just like, I was just kind of relaxed.

1976
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:26,449
I could say it, but I think it's better for you to read it.

1977
01:45:26,449 --> 01:45:30,220
But that's the context.

1978
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:48,800
Ooh, so fun to do that with Agony.

1979
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,520
Oh, I got it.

1980
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:57,649
You just sit in the back and just drop bombs.

1981
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,920
Nice, very nice.

1982
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,220
Oh, what are you doing?

1983
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:23,890
You said you only really do edibles.

1984
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:27,010
Well, I do tinctures and edibles.

1985
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:27,970
I don't smoke.

1986
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:30,930
Tinctures are really easy to do.

1987
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:33,170
Like a cup, just two or three milligrams and that's it.

1988
01:46:33,729 --> 01:46:35,250
Just to kind of relax on the couch.

1989
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:43,340
I don't, this is not, I'm not condoning anybody doing any type of drugs.

1990
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:54,399
Described my reasoning for why I do, sometimes, THC, marijuana.

1991
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,560
It actually is one of the things that helps incredibly for me, personally.

1992
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,819
I'm gonna do a little bit for the pain bullshit.

1993
01:47:01,819 --> 01:47:02,819
There you go.

1994
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:07,649
It's a, we're in a progressive decade, Jeremy.

1995
01:47:07,649 --> 01:47:11,489
You don't have to, well, so drugs are, no, I don't,

1996
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:13,489
I would say the same thing about alcohol.

1997
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,619
The whole point with Agony is just being annoying.

1998
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:24,319
Oh my goodness.

1999
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:29,220
Oh fuck, I'm doing bad.

2000
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:32,420
All right, I'm paying too much attention to like telling you guys a dumb story.

2001
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:41,090
My little brother just heard you.

2002
01:47:41,729 --> 01:47:42,449
I want to read that.

2003
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:47,789
My little brother just heard you use drugs and he already got two kilograms of meth.

2004
01:47:47,789 --> 01:47:53,039
Please next time instead say math books to trick him.

2005
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:55,520
You have to click that you're over 18 to watch the stream.

2006
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:02,180
So, excuse me.

2007
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:05,060
Or mature audience warning, right?

2008
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:13,630
He's not watching his little brother just heard.

2009
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:18,270
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have the TV so loud while you're watching The Sopranos.

2010
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:21,409
Because I remember that used to happen to me.

2011
01:48:21,409 --> 01:48:25,170
I remember being in my house and my dad watching The Sopranos in the other room.

2012
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:29,489
And he'd be like, oh, you fucking idiot, you fucking guy, stupid fucking.

2013
01:48:29,489 --> 01:48:32,689
And I would be in the other room and I would kind of walk out and he'd be like,

2014
01:48:32,689 --> 01:48:34,609
hey, hey, hey, hey, you shouldn't be in here.

2015
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:38,850
It's like, well, you watch it at like fucking 80% volume.

2016
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:55,550
Ooh, kill.

2017
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,260
Oh, let's be fucking cheeky here.

2018
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:11,010
Oh, I had the idea halfway through.

2019
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:11,510
Shit.

2020
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:14,899
I was going to put the gas down and stun him,

2021
01:49:14,899 --> 01:49:19,060
but I had the idea to do that when I was like at the last second.

2022
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:19,560
Shit.

2023
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:29,250
Oh, oh, god damn it.

2024
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:29,489
All right.

2025
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:36,609
This is not a great game right now.

2026
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:40,210
Yeah, I remember specifically, I remember my dad would watch The Sopranos

2027
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:44,640
and I would walk in the room and he would just like change back.

2028
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:46,960
I don't know if the remotes still have this,

2029
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,569
but remotes had this thing called like the last channel button

2030
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:53,970
where if you pressed it, it would just kind of,

2031
01:49:53,970 --> 01:50:00,630
it's like when you pressed Q in Team Fortress or an FPS and it goes to your last weapon.

2032
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:04,869
He would just press Q on his keyboard essentially and switch to like the news.

2033
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:09,409
So I would walk in the room and I would hear like,

2034
01:50:09,409 --> 01:50:10,449
let me tell you something.

2035
01:50:10,449 --> 01:50:12,210
You are, the local weather today,

2036
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:14,289
we're going to be having some sunny sunshine outside.

2037
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:18,050
And of course, make sure you go to the rat festival next week.

2038
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,750
That's what would happen every time.

2039
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,229
I would leave the room and it'd be like,

2040
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:24,789
oh, yeah, Janet, that's a very good quit.

2041
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:25,430
Fuck it, idiot.

2042
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:29,060
Get him, shoot him in the fucking head.

2043
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:32,500
Shoot him in the, last night, a cat snuck up into the,

2044
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,819
it was switched so weirdly between the two of them

2045
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:36,260
that it was so confusing to pay attention to.

2046
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:39,060
I don't even know how he enjoyed the show

2047
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,340
because he had to do that all the time.

2048
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:52,680
No, this is a bullshit story.

2049
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,680
This is not a bullshit story.

2050
01:50:54,680 --> 01:51:07,409
I swear to God, you were very good at this game.

2051
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:12,340
Um, yeah, what do you say now?

2052
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:15,539
I killed the guy with two centimeters of health left.

2053
01:51:20,369 --> 01:51:22,449
Look, I'm also in like story Andy mode,

2054
01:51:22,449 --> 01:51:34,659
which means I can't play the video game.

2055
01:51:34,659 --> 01:51:36,260
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't hurt me.

2056
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:41,010
All right, I'm going way too hard here.

2057
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:49,800
Why was your dad afraid of swear words when you were 20?

2058
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,640
I was not 20, I was like fucking,

2059
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,520
I was like 15.

2060
01:51:55,159 --> 01:51:58,000
When did the Sopranos come out?

2061
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:13,960
Sopranos original release date was, uh, when was it?

2062
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,399
1997?

2063
01:52:18,439 --> 01:52:19,479
How old was I?

2064
01:52:19,479 --> 01:52:22,529
Oh, 30?

2065
01:52:22,529 --> 01:52:24,130
Okay, hold on, I gotta, shit.

2066
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:34,180
I wasn't 30.

2067
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:35,779
How old was I in 1997?

2068
01:52:39,989 --> 01:52:41,029
Help them, I know.

2069
01:52:41,989 --> 01:52:44,039
Look, they knew what they were signing up for.

2070
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:45,560
They're playing with a streamer.

2071
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,489
They're playing with a streamer who's not very good at this.

2072
01:52:49,489 --> 01:52:50,770
I think they know what they're getting into.

2073
01:52:56,819 --> 01:53:00,039
Oh, you were 12.

2074
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:10,050
Okay, so those of you that said that I was 20,

2075
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,199
I was like 13.

2076
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:25,399
12 is fine for swearing.

2077
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:40,689
Okay, well, uh, look, when you raise your kids,

2078
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:43,779
I, hold on, god damn it.

2079
01:53:43,779 --> 01:53:44,899
I was so greedy, but I think I got it.

2080
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,279
Ah, come on, I need to get that.

2081
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:58,159
Whoa, look out, it's Jormungandir.

2082
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:05,380
They're going to be swearing by 12 whether you like it or not.

2083
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:12,159
Okay, all I'm saying is that when I was like 12 years old,

2084
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:16,100
my parents didn't want me to watch like fucking,

2085
01:54:16,819 --> 01:54:19,300
it's the mafia guys shoot each other in the head.

2086
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:21,460
Okay, what are we having?

2087
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,260
What are you talking about?

2088
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:44,149
Internet generation versus Jormungandir who didn't swear until he was 40.

2089
01:54:52,529 --> 01:55:05,760
You guys, I'm 26 and I still don't swear in front of my parents.

2090
01:55:07,239 --> 01:55:08,520
Look, I don't know.

2091
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:15,380
I wasn't allowed to watch R rated movies until like later on in my teen years.

2092
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:16,420
Is that so bizarre?

2093
01:55:29,909 --> 01:55:30,869
No, not really.

2094
01:55:30,869 --> 01:55:31,750
It's pretty normal.

2095
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:43,989
Fake Jormungandir doesn't even look like the one from,

2096
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:49,279
I don't know why I was going to say guilds of war, god of war.

2097
01:55:49,840 --> 01:56:10,159
I don't know why I'm just trying to stun people that are not over here.

2098
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:21,720
Oh, they're close.

2099
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,329
I don't even care if I die.

2100
01:56:27,329 --> 01:56:28,369
I don't even care if I die.

2101
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:29,810
Damn it.

2102
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,569
I thought they were going to run to the right, not left, to try to juke me.

2103
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:50,560
We're going in.

2104
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,600
It looks like we're going in.

2105
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:53,380
It looks like we're going in.

2106
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,279
Oh, shit.

2107
01:57:08,949 --> 01:57:14,369
Good, good.

2108
01:57:14,369 --> 01:57:15,430
Keep it up.

2109
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:29,539
Get him on the run.

2110
01:57:29,539 --> 01:57:37,729
Why is he playing this boomer game?

2111
01:57:39,409 --> 01:57:41,170
I don't know what any terminology is anymore.

2112
01:57:41,729 --> 01:57:53,199
I don't know any of this terminology is.

2113
01:57:54,199 --> 01:57:54,920
So over my head.

2114
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:10,119
Oh, you're in trouble now.

2115
01:58:10,119 --> 01:58:11,239
We really pulled this back.

2116
01:58:11,239 --> 01:58:11,880
We were losing.

2117
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:17,569
We were losing.

2118
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:33,000
Sorry, my sacrifice is mine.

2119
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,229
No, we already went over this.

2120
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:43,430
You can't say this is the worst stream because you don't like the game.

2121
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:46,069
That's not how that works.

2122
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:49,670
This would be worst stream if it took me an hour of technical problems to get here.

2123
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,199
And then we didn't talk about anything fun.

2124
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:56,239
And like, I'm not having a good time and the game sucks.

2125
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,560
Well, I mean, if you don't just because you don't like the game

2126
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,800
does not make it a contender for worst stream 2021.

2127
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,039
That's just your personal preference for video games.

2128
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,560
Excuse me.

2129
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:14,899
Is that a hairball?

2130
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:15,619
Yeah.

2131
01:59:15,619 --> 01:59:20,560
Come on, Ra.

2132
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,939
Do I have enough money for anything?

2133
01:59:21,939 --> 01:59:24,020
Why did I buy the Rod of Tahootie right now?

2134
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:26,819
God, you know, we play smite, us gamers.

2135
01:59:27,779 --> 01:59:29,140
If you know, if you know, you know.

2136
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,619
Why do they get Rod of Tahootie as my fourth item?

2137
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:33,890
It's my gamers.

2138
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:38,760
No, this is the worst thing you can stream.

2139
01:59:42,289 --> 01:59:43,010
I disagree.

2140
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:55,319
Holy shit.

2141
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:56,359
I didn't even know you were here.

2142
01:59:56,359 --> 01:59:59,560
What the fuck?

2143
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,199
Oh, my God.

2144
02:00:00,199 --> 02:00:01,720
I just came out of nowhere.

2145
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:05,720
Yeah.

2146
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:06,279
Holy shit.

2147
02:00:06,279 --> 02:00:07,079
I wasn't paying attention.

2148
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,079
I'm reading chat.

2149
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:10,039
I should just delete chat.

2150
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:18,630
Read the iPad thing.

2151
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:20,630
Actually, let me get this on like Discord so I can link to it.

2152
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:27,810
Oh, I got 24 seconds.

2153
02:00:27,810 --> 02:00:28,529
Nice.

2154
02:00:28,529 --> 02:00:29,649
That's enough time.

2155
02:00:29,649 --> 02:00:43,279
That's enough time.

2156
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,970
Now, let me get this on screen.

2157
02:00:46,689 --> 02:00:48,390
Because I think this is going to be over in a minute.

2158
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:53,109
Shit, I got to hold on.

2159
02:00:53,109 --> 02:00:54,630
Do I have any money?

2160
02:00:57,270 --> 02:01:04,130
Why don't you do the hangout portions of the stream anymore?

2161
02:01:04,130 --> 02:01:04,930
OK, hold on.

2162
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:05,649
This is important.

2163
02:01:07,649 --> 02:01:10,369
I'm reading the fucking chat room.

2164
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:15,989
It's like you can't, OK, this game,

2165
02:01:15,989 --> 02:01:19,189
you can't just like turn your head to the left and just read it.

2166
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:21,430
I just lost us the game.

2167
02:01:22,069 --> 02:01:31,189
OK, anyways.

2168
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:36,470
Yeah, Chad, why are you talking?

2169
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:37,430
You just lost us the game.

2170
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:38,390
What the hell?

2171
02:01:40,119 --> 02:01:42,279
All right, let me let me get this thing.

2172
02:01:44,659 --> 02:01:52,640
Hey, I want to put this on screen and we're going to get

2173
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,359
I'm going to give you a second to read.

2174
02:01:53,359 --> 02:01:55,359
Remember, I'll give you a little bit more context.

2175
02:01:55,359 --> 02:02:04,279
It's there.

2176
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:04,840
Is it there?

2177
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:16,600
OK, so context wise, again, don't do context.

2178
02:02:17,319 --> 02:02:18,680
I have to do at least some context.

2179
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,189
This is oh, this is kind of blurry.

2180
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:32,630
All right, can you guys be able to see this shit?

2181
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:39,619
Why is this so huge?

2182
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:44,470
OK, context again.

2183
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:49,909
This is I was high and I was playing Cookie Run Kingdom

2184
02:02:49,909 --> 02:02:53,119
and I had a brilliant idea for a video game

2185
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:55,039
like the storyline of a video game.

2186
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:56,680
I'm not going to say anything.

2187
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,039
I'm just going to let you read it

2188
02:02:58,039 --> 02:02:59,560
and we're going to show it right now.

2189
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:20,149
This is just the Avengers, but they're evil.

2190
02:03:20,149 --> 02:03:24,279
A party of Earth's five, weren't there six Avengers?

2191
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:28,039
A party of Earth's five most powerful heroes.

2192
02:03:28,039 --> 02:03:30,439
Heroes storms the enemy's base.

2193
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:33,409
They defeat the ultimate villain and claim the castle.

2194
02:03:33,409 --> 02:03:35,489
These are the antagonists of the game.

2195
02:03:35,489 --> 02:03:45,680
They become evil soon after.

2196
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,119
Are you eight years old?

2197
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:52,739
This is an AI.

2198
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:54,260
Yeah, that's like Talk to Transformer.

2199
02:03:56,850 --> 02:04:01,399
And I took the screenshot.

2200
02:04:01,399 --> 02:04:02,600
This is me taking a screen.

2201
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:07,439
Like I held the camera from the phone up to the screen

2202
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:09,840
and press snap camera button.

2203
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:18,050
There's a dog hair on the screen.

2204
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:27,279
There are like five dog hairs.

2205
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:30,920
Oh my God, look at them all.

2206
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,680
There's one, two, three, four.

2207
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:35,939
There are like five or six dog hairs.

2208
02:04:35,939 --> 02:04:38,979
A party of Earth's five most powerful dog hairs.

2209
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:46,500
Well, there you go.

2210
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,699
That was my brilliant idea.

2211
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:51,779
By the way, Hi Me wants 5% of royalties

2212
02:04:51,779 --> 02:04:53,779
from all the money you make from that awesome video game.

2213
02:04:59,319 --> 02:05:00,279
Let's play another one.

2214
02:05:00,279 --> 02:05:03,649
All right, we're going to do one more assault

2215
02:05:04,819 --> 02:05:06,180
and then we're going to move.

2216
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:08,260
We're going to play a game of conquest one

2217
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:09,779
and it's going to be horrible and I'm going to hate it.

2218
02:05:09,779 --> 02:05:13,859
The game's already been made.

2219
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:22,479
All right, we're going to play a game called Guess the Password.

2220
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:33,109
I'm going to make it easy for you.

2221
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:41,569
Let's see if you get it.

2222
02:05:41,569 --> 02:05:43,189
Here we go.

2223
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:54,079
Somebody got it.

2224
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:59,430
Wow, that's actually surprising.

2225
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:04,680
That's really surprising.

2226
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,479
More of you get it now.

2227
02:06:07,479 --> 02:06:10,529
I mean, there's a lot of people here.

2228
02:06:10,529 --> 02:06:14,689
The password is susguy with no spaces, no capitals.

2229
02:06:14,689 --> 02:06:19,699
Do Fortnite Friday.

2230
02:06:19,699 --> 02:06:22,470
No, I don't think that's what we're going to do.

2231
02:06:29,079 --> 02:06:30,039
After this, we're going to take a break.

2232
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,850
I'm going to get some water, maybe another coffee and I'll come back.

2233
02:06:33,409 --> 02:06:42,739
This time I'm actually going to.

2234
02:06:42,739 --> 02:06:43,939
That's so loud.

2235
02:06:43,939 --> 02:06:48,210
Okay, I kind of know how to play 100 bots.

2236
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:49,970
Not really though.

2237
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:55,779
I want to really pay attention to this one.

2238
02:06:55,779 --> 02:06:57,989
So this is going to be a gamer match.

2239
02:06:59,619 --> 02:07:02,180
What that means is I'm not going to be talking to chat really.

2240
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:03,460
I'm going to be focusing.

2241
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:07,960
This is going to be a gamer one.

2242
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:12,159
Why are you not playing Dota?

2243
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:24,869
I think the difference between Dota and Smite for me is one requires an entire lesson plan.

2244
02:07:24,869 --> 02:07:29,670
One really requires you to do a full class with a professor for a year

2245
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:33,970
before you're comfortable really playing the game against people.

2246
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:40,899
You guys think that in the future there'll be classes for video games?

2247
02:07:40,899 --> 02:07:43,329
Before you laugh at me.

2248
02:07:43,329 --> 02:07:46,289
Everybody laughed at me when I said that gaming would be in the Olympics.

2249
02:07:46,289 --> 02:07:50,289
Remember five to ten years ago when I made that video?

2250
02:07:50,289 --> 02:07:52,869
Everybody laughed at me.

2251
02:07:52,869 --> 02:07:55,029
Do you think that in some of like the most prestigious colleges

2252
02:07:55,029 --> 02:07:58,079
there will be League of Legends classes?

2253
02:07:58,079 --> 02:08:09,409
They already exist now.

2254
02:08:09,409 --> 02:08:12,630
Okay, well, all right.

2255
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:14,920
All right, here we go.

2256
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:16,439
All right, quiet.

2257
02:08:17,079 --> 02:08:18,789
You know, just put me on in the background.

2258
02:08:18,789 --> 02:08:19,989
Just chill for a little bit.

2259
02:08:19,989 --> 02:08:20,710
We're going to hang out.

2260
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:26,880
Just have me on in another tab while you're in your League of Legends course.

2261
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:38,930
Okay, I want.

2262
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:41,329
Do you people build pun bats?

2263
02:08:41,329 --> 02:08:42,210
Tanky?

2264
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:43,489
Do they?

2265
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:46,979
What do they have?

2266
02:08:46,979 --> 02:08:48,819
That's so much physical.

2267
02:08:49,539 --> 02:08:51,859
Yeah, I got to get a physical protection.

2268
02:08:51,859 --> 02:08:56,229
Any of these physical?

2269
02:08:57,989 --> 02:08:58,390
Magic?

2270
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:00,880
No, I need physical.

2271
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,470
We'll do the cool down one.

2272
02:09:03,649 --> 02:09:04,289
Okay, that's good.

2273
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:07,760
What's the weather like in Vegas?

2274
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,359
It's actually really nice recently.

2275
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:14,239
It's cooled down quite a bit.

2276
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:15,039
Okay, everybody.

2277
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:15,520
Here we go.

2278
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,960
Time for a gamer stream.

2279
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:35,279
Good luck.

2280
02:09:35,279 --> 02:09:35,920
Thank you.

2281
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:36,319
Here we go.

2282
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:42,479
I'm going to play as if no one's watching.

2283
02:10:06,279 --> 02:10:24,039
Never to jump up.

2284
02:10:24,039 --> 02:10:33,409
Don't shoot me.

2285
02:10:33,409 --> 02:10:47,729
Nope.

2286
02:10:47,729 --> 02:10:49,170
Oh, good grab.

2287
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:54,020
I didn't capitalize.

2288
02:10:58,609 --> 02:10:59,569
The streamer gets that.

2289
02:10:59,569 --> 02:11:00,130
I'm the streamer.

2290
02:11:00,130 --> 02:11:04,159
I get it.

2291
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:13,510
Sobek is godlike.

2292
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:17,159
I don't think the Sobek has missed one pull.

2293
02:11:17,159 --> 02:11:19,270
And he's just talking.

2294
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:21,270
He's just like monologuing.

2295
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:23,109
This Sobek is also streaming.

2296
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:24,239
See?

2297
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:29,140
And what a distraction that was, wasn't it?

2298
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:30,579
Wasn't that quite a distraction?

2299
02:11:30,579 --> 02:11:35,159
I have no mana.

2300
02:11:35,159 --> 02:11:50,180
What are you beeping?

2301
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:55,300
Thank you.

2302
02:11:56,979 --> 02:11:57,699
Thank you so much.

2303
02:11:57,699 --> 02:11:59,760
I've loved your stream, by the way.

2304
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,199
I love Sobek gaming.

2305
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:14,279
I get all these tips and tricks.

2306
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:15,800
Ooh, you always got them.

2307
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,359
That was close.

2308
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:20,390
I wish I could go in.

2309
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:21,430
I think I'm just going to go in and die.

2310
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:23,590
Yeah, this is the time to do it.

2311
02:12:24,149 --> 02:12:34,100
This is the time to just die and get a few hits.

2312
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:34,819
Okay, I got somebody.

2313
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:40,520
Shit, I don't have enough money.

2314
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:50,689
Turn up the game volume?

2315
02:12:51,329 --> 02:12:52,600
Oh, if I'm not going to be talking,

2316
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,720
then yeah, you should be able to hear more.

2317
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:05,399
Bro, it's weird to see you play against regular players.

2318
02:13:06,039 --> 02:13:07,329
What do you mean?

2319
02:13:07,329 --> 02:13:14,880
There's no way I'm going to turn on voice chat.

2320
02:13:17,029 --> 02:13:20,020
Zero percent chance.

2321
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:20,659
All right, quiet.

2322
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:46,979
I'll set around.

2323
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:47,619
Ace cam?

2324
02:13:47,619 --> 02:13:48,979
No, stop distracting me.

2325
02:13:49,539 --> 02:13:57,250
I heard a cool video game sound.

2326
02:14:01,119 --> 02:14:01,520
You get that.

2327
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,239
I don't need it.

2328
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:10,960
Oh, shit.

2329
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,319
Ace cam.

2330
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:26,039
I don't have a shirt on.

2331
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:26,920
I can't put a face cam on.

2332
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:27,239
Sorry.

2333
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:34,770
Come on, I'm 0 and 2.

2334
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:35,649
This is stupid.

2335
02:14:41,479 --> 02:14:42,279
All right, I'm going to do the thing

2336
02:14:42,279 --> 02:14:43,880
that is really frowned upon

2337
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,239
and that stands still in spawn

2338
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:46,520
so you can complete your item.

2339
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:49,699
See how it works.

2340
02:15:06,289 --> 02:15:07,409
Ooh, full body cam.

2341
02:15:07,409 --> 02:15:08,449
Nobody does that, do they?

2342
02:15:11,859 --> 02:15:14,420
Is there a streamer that has a full body cam,

2343
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:15,619
not just a head face cam?

2344
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:19,750
They're sitting here playing a game

2345
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:21,109
and they just have an entire body cam?

2346
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:24,310
I'm talking head to toe.

2347
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:38,930
Nice job.

2348
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:40,210
It's perfectly aligned to make it

2349
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:41,729
so they're always in frame,

2350
02:15:41,729 --> 02:15:42,850
their whole standing body.

2351
02:15:43,489 --> 02:15:48,000
We going in?

2352
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:50,609
Oh, I think we're going in.

2353
02:15:50,609 --> 02:15:51,489
I think we're going in.

2354
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,149
Oh, they're all so close.

2355
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:07,810
Oh, they're all so close.

2356
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:08,369
All right, let's go.

2357
02:16:09,010 --> 02:16:18,579
Oh, kill him.

2358
02:16:23,239 --> 02:16:24,840
Oh, he's so low, this tier.

2359
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:25,479
God damn it.

2360
02:16:30,229 --> 02:16:30,949
I didn't feed.

2361
02:16:30,949 --> 02:16:31,989
I did a lot of work.

2362
02:16:31,989 --> 02:16:33,840
What are we throwing?

2363
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:34,319
What?

2364
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:35,360
We killed like three people.

2365
02:16:41,399 --> 02:16:42,600
I can't make decisions on my own

2366
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,799
so I just pick what other people pick.

2367
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:50,719
What should I do?

2368
02:16:55,479 --> 02:16:55,879
Fuck.

2369
02:16:55,879 --> 02:16:56,520
Um, this one.

2370
02:17:06,389 --> 02:17:09,159
Jeremy, please, I need to know

2371
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:11,239
who your favorite smite character's ass is.

2372
02:17:11,799 --> 02:17:15,489
Do you think the first time you said

2373
02:17:15,489 --> 02:17:16,610
that I was going to give you a response?

2374
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:19,079
I'm that person enough for five seconds.

2375
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:27,270
Nope.

2376
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:34,159
Just got to defend.

2377
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:35,440
This is anybody's game.

2378
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,319
We have a lot more kills

2379
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:37,280
and a lot more money than they do,

2380
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,000
but that's fine.

2381
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,670
Is that a capo?

2382
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:40,760
You do emotes?

2383
02:17:41,319 --> 02:17:47,600
He's just going in.

2384
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:51,430
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2385
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:52,389
I don't know if that's a good idea.

2386
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:09,569
God damn it.

2387
02:18:12,129 --> 02:18:15,270
Oh, no, no, no, please.

2388
02:18:16,229 --> 02:18:19,520
I played up a hundred bats in assault

2389
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,399
is essentially just like,

2390
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:21,680
please kill me for free.

2391
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:35,399
You finish your homework?

2392
02:18:35,399 --> 02:18:36,280
I don't do homework.

2393
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:39,079
I never hand in homework not one time

2394
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:40,200
and I get an A on every test

2395
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:40,760
so I get a C.

2396
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:03,920
I did the same.

2397
02:19:04,479 --> 02:19:10,180
No, I did homework.

2398
02:19:10,739 --> 02:19:15,649
Fairly decent amount of the time.

2399
02:19:15,649 --> 02:19:17,090
I do think we actually can go in though.

2400
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:18,979
Yeah, we absolutely can.

2401
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:22,840
I'm jumping in and just throwing it.

2402
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:23,319
I don't even care.

2403
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:37,969
No, no, fuck.

2404
02:19:37,969 --> 02:19:38,770
I saw it happen.

2405
02:19:39,729 --> 02:19:43,639
No, I thought I was in the clear.

2406
02:19:43,639 --> 02:19:44,760
I see this guy in the sky.

2407
02:19:45,719 --> 02:19:50,790
I walked right into it too.

2408
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:51,430
God damn it.

2409
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:52,629
I have one in five.

2410
02:19:52,629 --> 02:19:53,909
I can't be this shitty one.

2411
02:19:54,549 --> 02:19:56,370
Use your three to teleport.

2412
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:07,829
What?

2413
02:20:07,829 --> 02:20:12,389
That's actually okay.

2414
02:20:12,389 --> 02:20:13,510
That's really helpful.

2415
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:15,719
That's very helpful.

2416
02:20:15,719 --> 02:20:16,600
Who's doing all the damage?

2417
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:18,959
It's all physical.

2418
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:24,239
This is good damage.

2419
02:20:24,239 --> 02:20:27,409
Whatever movement speed.

2420
02:20:27,409 --> 02:20:27,889
I want that.

2421
02:20:35,329 --> 02:20:38,760
I put my headphones down

2422
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,799
to focus on a math problem.

2423
02:20:39,799 --> 02:20:41,559
That's in that sound you made.

2424
02:20:41,559 --> 02:20:43,239
I could hear it across my whole desk.

2425
02:20:43,239 --> 02:20:52,209
Careful.

2426
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:53,729
Oh, shit.

2427
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,399
But no.

2428
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:57,760
What the fuck, dude?

2429
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,399
Why?

2430
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:58,639
No.

2431
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:04,559
That was bad.

2432
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:05,200
God damn it.

2433
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:12,290
All right.

2434
02:21:12,290 --> 02:21:12,930
No more talking.

2435
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:13,969
I'm paying attention.

2436
02:21:13,969 --> 02:21:29,809
This is bad.

2437
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:34,239
Get off me.

2438
02:21:34,239 --> 02:21:34,559
Get off.

2439
02:21:53,299 --> 02:21:53,700
Nice.

2440
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:54,420
Good work.

2441
02:21:54,420 --> 02:22:04,850
Oh, he's in the air.

2442
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:08,709
What else?

2443
02:22:08,709 --> 02:22:09,510
Get the tower.

2444
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:16,840
Oh, are you serious?

2445
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:17,799
What a fucking god.

2446
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:22,319
No more swearing.

2447
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:23,760
I'm not going to say the fuck anymore.

2448
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:34,209
All right.

2449
02:22:34,209 --> 02:22:35,409
That was a good team fight.

2450
02:22:35,409 --> 02:22:41,030
Oops.

2451
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:42,549
I thought I didn't teleport.

2452
02:22:42,549 --> 02:22:43,350
I thought I teleported.

2453
02:22:59,270 --> 02:23:08,639
What was the one I wanted to get?

2454
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,159
This one.

2455
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:15,809
I hate it when you play video games.

2456
02:23:15,809 --> 02:23:17,889
You just have an entire room full of fidget toys

2457
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:27,889
that he uses on face cam.

2458
02:23:27,889 --> 02:23:29,010
Do you want to watch a cat?

2459
02:23:29,729 --> 02:23:31,540
I think there are plenty of streams

2460
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:32,659
where it's just a cat in a room

2461
02:23:32,659 --> 02:23:33,700
with a bunch of cat toys.

2462
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:36,790
Believe those already exist.

2463
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:51,799
They're at the Phoenix?

2464
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:09,760
Oh, my god.

2465
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:10,879
The Thanatos is going to kill me

2466
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:12,399
and I'm freaking out about it.

2467
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:13,280
Oh, my god.

2468
02:24:14,239 --> 02:24:15,860
Oh, they wasted their ult.

2469
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:24,899
I wish that indicator was smaller.

2470
02:24:24,899 --> 02:24:26,340
It takes up like your whole character

2471
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,020
and it's like just making you panic.

2472
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,059
I'm playing Hunbats.

2473
02:24:37,059 --> 02:24:37,780
This character sucks.

2474
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,739
It's like literally F tier.

2475
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:41,840
I think on every Smite tier list

2476
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,200
this character is actually at the bottom.

2477
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,040
It's never picked.

2478
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:57,639
Yeah, I looked up Smite tier list before this

2479
02:24:57,639 --> 02:24:58,600
and it was like Hunbats,

2480
02:24:59,479 --> 02:25:00,280
they didn't put him on the list.

2481
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:01,000
They didn't even place him.

2482
02:25:01,639 --> 02:25:06,020
He's only been played in one game in competitive

2483
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:07,139
is because they banned everybody.

2484
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:08,180
They banned all the characters

2485
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,899
that their hunter was really good at.

2486
02:25:24,899 --> 02:25:25,540
Their hunter?

2487
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:26,420
Whatever, assassin.

2488
02:25:29,729 --> 02:25:30,770
Oh, I'm the only one alive.

2489
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:45,280
Oh, they think they're going to fuck around.

2490
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,329
My god, run.

2491
02:25:48,559 --> 02:25:50,159
My god, this person's terrifying.

2492
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:50,719
Oh, my god.

2493
02:25:50,719 --> 02:25:51,920
He's getting closer.

2494
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:52,959
I hate Thanatos.

2495
02:25:52,959 --> 02:25:53,760
He's terrifying.

2496
02:25:59,299 --> 02:26:00,180
Damn it.

2497
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:01,459
Get away from me.

2498
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:17,670
What are you doing?

2499
02:26:27,569 --> 02:26:28,049
Where is he?

2500
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:29,090
Where are you?

2501
02:26:31,909 --> 02:26:34,709
I successfully defended the fortress.

2502
02:26:41,649 --> 02:26:54,770
This is it.

2503
02:26:54,770 --> 02:26:55,729
This is where we win.

2504
02:26:55,729 --> 02:26:57,399
You're playing smart.

2505
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:15,040
Just kill the Titan.

2506
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:15,920
Who cares about anything else?

2507
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:18,790
Kill the Titan.

2508
02:27:19,969 --> 02:27:20,850
Oh, thank god.

2509
02:27:20,850 --> 02:27:21,329
Nice work.

2510
02:27:25,479 --> 02:27:26,600
Hunbats is actually pretty fun.

2511
02:27:27,239 --> 02:27:28,600
I'd put him on C tier.

2512
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,700
I've seen some tier lists that put him pretty low

2513
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:32,579
and that's not fair.

2514
02:27:32,579 --> 02:27:33,459
He has a really good kit.

2515
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:45,299
I really like this person's stream.

2516
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:46,659
Very friendly.

2517
02:27:46,659 --> 02:27:47,940
They gave me the buff like three times.

2518
02:27:53,489 --> 02:27:54,610
I'm going to take a pee break

2519
02:27:54,610 --> 02:27:56,129
and get some water, maybe a coffee.

2520
02:27:56,129 --> 02:27:57,829
I'll come back and we'll do a little bit more.

2521
02:27:58,469 --> 02:32:24,069
I will be right back.

2522
02:32:24,069 --> 02:32:27,750
When did Cash App give 69 subs?

2523
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:34,420
When did that happen?

2524
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:36,899
I missed that completely.

2525
02:32:36,899 --> 02:32:39,329
Oh, it was like 20 minutes ago.

2526
02:32:39,329 --> 02:32:40,290
It was like an hour ago.

2527
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:40,930
What?

2528
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:46,719
Was I just locked into gamer mode?

2529
02:32:46,719 --> 02:32:47,680
Oh, okay.

2530
02:32:48,879 --> 02:32:51,920
Well, thank you Cash App for the 69 community subs.

2531
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:54,049
That's a lot.

2532
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:01,280
Thank you Zap X for the 10 community subs.

2533
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:05,409
And Loxbury, thanks for five community subs.

2534
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:09,440
Thank you, thank you.

2535
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:10,959
I'm always in gamer mode.

2536
02:33:10,959 --> 02:33:11,440
I'm not.

2537
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:13,440
I'm in gamer mode for like five minutes a week.

2538
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:23,239
Let me go here.

2539
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:26,930
All right, let's do...

2540
02:33:31,159 --> 02:33:32,280
I got some skins.

2541
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:32,600
I did.

2542
02:33:33,239 --> 02:33:37,190
Because I had to buy the god pack on this account.

2543
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:39,799
I got the god pack and then I got some gems

2544
02:33:39,799 --> 02:33:41,239
just to play around with and I already...

2545
02:33:41,239 --> 02:33:44,120
I think I like freaked out and I bought like four boxes.

2546
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:46,000
I don't even know what I own.

2547
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,319
Is there a way to see what I actually own?

2548
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:58,930
Can I see the gods that I actually have skins with or no?

2549
02:33:58,930 --> 02:33:59,969
Sort by purchased.

2550
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:04,389
Purchased, purchased?

2551
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:07,079
No, sadly.

2552
02:34:07,079 --> 02:34:07,559
Oh, okay.

2553
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:10,520
I got a skin for somebody besides Anubis.

2554
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:11,000
Who was it?

2555
02:34:11,639 --> 02:34:15,479
I feel like it was Achilles or something.

2556
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:15,879
Let's see.

2557
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:17,399
Yeah, what's this one?

2558
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:21,670
That's all right.

2559
02:34:22,229 --> 02:34:24,319
Can we go through and look at the skins?

2560
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:26,319
Is that boring content for you guys?

2561
02:34:26,319 --> 02:34:29,270
How boring is that?

2562
02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:30,229
At a scale of one to ten.

2563
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:42,049
All right, that's fine.

2564
02:34:42,049 --> 02:34:43,670
Who's this?

2565
02:34:44,389 --> 02:34:45,399
Charibdis?

2566
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,079
Charibdis.

2567
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:51,059
Charibdis?

2568
02:34:51,059 --> 02:34:51,700
How do I say this?

2569
02:34:52,629 --> 02:34:53,270
Charibdis?

2570
02:34:53,989 --> 02:35:02,600
Who is this?

2571
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:07,030
Charribdis.

2572
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:10,549
All right, what do you got for skins?

2573
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:17,760
Ah, it's just blue.

2574
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:18,719
That's cool.

2575
02:35:18,719 --> 02:35:19,379
What is this one?

2576
02:35:19,379 --> 02:35:20,100
This one's limited.

2577
02:35:20,739 --> 02:35:29,729
This item will never be available through special promotions or events ever again.

2578
02:35:29,729 --> 02:35:32,600
Oh, okay.

2579
02:35:36,399 --> 02:35:37,920
Who's a god that I like to play?

2580
02:35:42,389 --> 02:35:44,149
Not even subtle about the FOMO.

2581
02:35:45,350 --> 02:35:47,059
Oh, here it is.

2582
02:35:47,059 --> 02:35:47,540
Okay, here.

2583
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:52,760
It's just Aang.

2584
02:35:53,319 --> 02:35:56,159
He's dead.

2585
02:35:56,159 --> 02:36:02,440
I kind of want this.

2586
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:08,290
This one's 3,500 gems.

2587
02:36:09,350 --> 02:36:10,149
What is that?

2588
02:36:10,149 --> 02:36:12,149
Is that like a $50 skin?

2589
02:36:12,149 --> 02:36:13,190
How expensive is that?

2590
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,719
Okay.

2591
02:36:34,709 --> 02:36:35,510
Is this the same actor?

2592
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:36,149
No, it can't be.

2593
02:36:38,149 --> 02:36:38,870
It's a middle lane.

2594
02:36:43,670 --> 02:36:52,500
That's really nice and great and dandy, but what does it actually sound like in-game?

2595
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,500
And then they don't do it again and they just play the game.

2596
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:06,790
Whoa, Ghost Rider.

2597
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:08,469
This is the one that I like.

2598
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:10,149
This is the Merlin I want to see.

2599
02:37:11,329 --> 02:37:12,770
Yep, that's the one.

2600
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:17,329
They got a lot of Merlin skins.

2601
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:29,360
It's the jewel wizard.

2602
02:37:30,850 --> 02:37:35,809
Yeah, it kind of is.

2603
02:37:35,809 --> 02:37:37,430
Cool.

2604
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:40,149
I tried to play King Arthur in a training match,

2605
02:37:40,629 --> 02:37:42,739
but the moveset was so weird to me.

2606
02:37:42,739 --> 02:37:43,700
I just couldn't even.

2607
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,739
I just exited.

2608
02:37:44,739 --> 02:37:45,889
Where is he?

2609
02:37:45,889 --> 02:37:50,600
Where's Arthur?

2610
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:55,030
Is it King Arthur and not Arthur?

2611
02:37:55,590 --> 02:37:59,319
King Arthur.

2612
02:37:59,319 --> 02:38:05,399
King Arthur is just Arthas.

2613
02:38:10,799 --> 02:38:13,840
Didn't they base everything on the Arthurian shit anyways?

2614
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:22,690
All the way around?

2615
02:38:23,889 --> 02:38:26,129
There was an Uther before Uther in Warcraft.

2616
02:38:28,309 --> 02:38:29,829
Just to let you know.

2617
02:38:29,829 --> 02:38:33,639
Okay, we got a dragon one.

2618
02:38:33,639 --> 02:38:38,340
That's kind of cool.

2619
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:39,700
Look at Cthulhu's skin.

2620
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:40,659
Oh, that's what we're going to do.

2621
02:38:41,459 --> 02:38:45,989
I've got a pretty good bugleberry skin.

2622
02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:53,600
It's young Arthur.

2623
02:38:54,239 --> 02:39:00,579
Cthulhu has a cuphead skin.

2624
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:03,200
You're losing viewers.

2625
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:04,370
That's okay.

2626
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:07,969
Why is that surprise anybody?

2627
02:39:07,969 --> 02:39:13,319
I'm in a menu looking at skins.

2628
02:39:13,319 --> 02:39:14,440
Actually, I like this one.

2629
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:24,420
All right, Cthulhu.

2630
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:25,299
Let's see.

2631
02:39:25,299 --> 02:39:30,770
What do you got?

2632
02:39:30,770 --> 02:39:31,649
This one's exclusive.

2633
02:39:34,069 --> 02:39:34,469
Purple.

2634
02:39:34,469 --> 02:39:37,909
His purple skin is only available for a limited time only.

2635
02:39:37,909 --> 02:39:40,959
What's the difference?

2636
02:39:40,959 --> 02:39:49,750
Oh, he's purple.

2637
02:39:49,750 --> 02:39:50,469
That one's cool.

2638
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:52,899
Yeah, okay.

2639
02:39:52,899 --> 02:39:53,780
I could see that.

2640
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:55,219
That one would be fun to have.

2641
02:39:55,219 --> 02:39:57,920
What is this, like, America one?

2642
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:06,079
Okay, cool.

2643
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:17,280
Okay, this is one of those cases where

2644
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:19,840
I would play against this person

2645
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:22,770
and I would not know this was Cthulhu.

2646
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:23,969
It would fuck with me.

2647
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:31,799
This changes the whole character to a point

2648
02:40:31,799 --> 02:40:33,000
where this is a different character.

2649
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:40,790
This item can be earned through an event

2650
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:43,909
or purchase for its full price once the event has ended.

2651
02:40:51,459 --> 02:40:53,940
Why is this just the single player in Mortal Kombat?

2652
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:54,879
What do I have to do?

2653
02:40:56,629 --> 02:40:57,430
Buy all.

2654
02:40:57,989 --> 02:41:01,729
I need 160,000 Odyssey points.

2655
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:07,799
More points.

2656
02:41:07,799 --> 02:41:09,000
Quest map.

2657
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,760
This is the shit I was talking about.

2658
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:13,700
This is exactly what I was talking about.

2659
02:41:13,700 --> 02:41:16,799
Visit territory.

2660
02:41:16,799 --> 02:41:20,100
Okay, what does this have to do with the video game Smite?

2661
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:20,899
What is this?

2662
02:41:20,899 --> 02:41:24,879
Complete all the quests.

2663
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:25,840
Oh, okay.

2664
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:28,159
Play an assassin in two games and you get this.

2665
02:41:28,159 --> 02:41:29,440
This is too much for my brain.

2666
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:33,329
It's just a battle pass.

2667
02:41:33,329 --> 02:41:34,739
Okay, right.

2668
02:41:34,739 --> 02:41:35,139
Rules.

2669
02:41:37,479 --> 02:41:39,239
Is the end user license agreement?

2670
02:41:40,639 --> 02:41:41,040
Lore.

2671
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:43,879
Bundles.

2672
02:41:43,879 --> 02:41:48,040
I already bought a bunch of these.

2673
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:51,219
All right, well, that's cool.

2674
02:41:51,219 --> 02:41:52,979
There's one that I want you to look at as well

2675
02:41:52,979 --> 02:41:56,579
that is also kind of game breaking and bizarre is this one.

2676
02:41:56,579 --> 02:42:05,489
It's just so weird.

2677
02:42:06,049 --> 02:42:11,889
I like this one.

2678
02:42:11,889 --> 02:42:17,319
That's terrifying.

2679
02:42:17,319 --> 02:42:19,430
And look at this.

2680
02:42:20,069 --> 02:42:23,680
It's just a bunch of cartoon characters.

2681
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:39,920
What is this?

2682
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:43,159
I'm not going to buy this stuff.

2683
02:42:43,159 --> 02:42:44,440
I'm not going to play this game.

2684
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:45,799
What the fuck?

2685
02:42:45,799 --> 02:42:48,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2686
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:49,079
What does it say?

2687
02:42:51,559 --> 02:42:55,879
What's this supposed to be?

2688
02:42:56,840 --> 02:43:00,770
Check out the Doge skin.

2689
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:06,500
Is it arterio?

2690
02:43:11,299 --> 02:43:13,600
Doge is a Doge skin.

2691
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:16,100
Where?

2692
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:16,899
Wrong one.

2693
02:43:16,899 --> 02:43:17,379
Scatty.

2694
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:45,159
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt here.

2695
02:43:45,719 --> 02:43:48,040
I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

2696
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:49,959
All right.

2697
02:43:49,959 --> 02:43:54,790
Did this come out this past like six, seven months?

2698
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:59,489
Or has this been a thing for the last couple of years?

2699
02:43:59,489 --> 02:44:00,610
Five years ago?

2700
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:04,389
This gets a pass.

2701
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:12,149
Four or five years ago.

2702
02:44:12,149 --> 02:44:14,260
Okay.

2703
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:15,059
Very old skin.

2704
02:44:15,059 --> 02:44:15,860
Yeah, okay.

2705
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:20,129
But they're not just jumping on this.

2706
02:44:20,129 --> 02:44:20,770
Okay.

2707
02:44:20,770 --> 02:44:26,250
What's this?

2708
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:27,620
Korra?

2709
02:44:33,670 --> 02:44:34,170
Whoa.

2710
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:40,530
What other cartoon characters are in this?

2711
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:42,559
Besides Ninja Turtles.

2712
02:44:42,559 --> 02:44:43,520
And who is Splinter?

2713
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:44,479
I know he's in the game.

2714
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:45,040
And Shredder.

2715
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:55,520
Is Stranger Things?

2716
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:56,719
Rick and Morty are not in this.

2717
02:44:56,719 --> 02:45:01,520
Please, I will buy them right now.

2718
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:04,559
If Rick and Morty are in the game, I'm going to buy Rick and Morty.

2719
02:45:04,559 --> 02:45:07,489
I'm going to play the rest of the stream as Rick and Morty.

2720
02:45:07,489 --> 02:45:08,610
Is that actually in the game?

2721
02:45:08,610 --> 02:45:09,329
I hate that.

2722
02:45:09,329 --> 02:45:09,829
I want it.

2723
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:16,790
There's a Pickle Rick skin.

2724
02:45:17,510 --> 02:45:22,680
All right.

2725
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:23,479
Where are they?

2726
02:45:23,479 --> 02:45:31,729
Who's Shredder?

2727
02:45:31,729 --> 02:45:34,049
If you play as Rick and Morty, this will be the worst stream.

2728
02:45:34,049 --> 02:45:37,219
I could agree with that.

2729
02:45:37,219 --> 02:45:37,940
Bear Insomniac?

2730
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:41,079
Okay.

2731
02:45:41,079 --> 02:45:41,959
Bear Insomniac.

2732
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:51,780
Whoa.

2733
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:52,420
Where?

2734
02:45:52,420 --> 02:46:01,459
Holy shit.

2735
02:46:02,899 --> 02:46:03,780
How much is this?

2736
02:46:07,569 --> 02:46:11,010
89,000 gems is how much money?

2737
02:46:11,010 --> 02:46:12,370
That's like a hundred bucks.

2738
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:16,079
Why?

2739
02:46:16,079 --> 02:46:16,959
That's a...

2740
02:46:16,959 --> 02:46:17,600
What is this?

2741
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,059
Oh, okay.

2742
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:22,579
This is where they get you.

2743
02:46:23,459 --> 02:46:25,540
This item can be earned through an event.

2744
02:46:26,610 --> 02:46:28,450
Or purchased for its full price.

2745
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:30,370
So I guess there's another way to earn this.

2746
02:46:30,370 --> 02:46:32,690
This is just if you don't want to go through all the trouble or something.

2747
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:32,930
I don't know.

2748
02:46:32,930 --> 02:46:33,969
That's a lot of money.

2749
02:46:33,969 --> 02:46:39,540
This one looks cool.

2750
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:45,670
I love the snapping.

2751
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:56,200
I got to play as Baron Sammy.

2752
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:56,440
Yeah.

2753
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:58,639
This is the new main.

2754
02:46:58,639 --> 02:46:59,440
Baron's really fun.

2755
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,399
I'm going to try him.

2756
02:47:01,399 --> 02:47:04,399
I want to find all the...

2757
02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:05,760
I know the Ninja Turtles.

2758
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:07,569
But a Thanatos?

2759
02:47:08,129 --> 02:47:11,750
Yeah.

2760
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:14,389
I remember Thanatos having a ton of skins even back when I played.

2761
02:47:32,069 --> 02:47:32,569
All right.

2762
02:47:41,479 --> 02:47:42,280
What the fuck?

2763
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:51,440
That's just...

2764
02:47:52,159 --> 02:47:54,579
It's just Cupid.

2765
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:57,600
This one...

2766
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,719
That one transforms.

2767
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,200
Which one?

2768
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:00,719
This one does?

2769
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:09,680
Go to Archon.

2770
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:14,559
Who's Ar-Ar-Archon?

2771
02:48:14,559 --> 02:48:15,200
Arrocon?

2772
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:26,129
Archon is the skin.

2773
02:48:26,129 --> 02:48:26,690
Oh.

2774
02:48:26,690 --> 02:48:27,809
Archon Thanatos?

2775
02:48:33,379 --> 02:48:33,780
Reaper.

2776
02:48:35,270 --> 02:48:35,909
Obey.

2777
02:48:35,909 --> 02:48:37,110
Where's Archon?

2778
02:48:37,110 --> 02:48:38,129
Grim Reaper.

2779
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:39,090
Cyber.

2780
02:48:43,989 --> 02:48:44,870
Classic.

2781
02:48:44,870 --> 02:48:45,829
Ruby Rose.

2782
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,200
Ruby Rose?

2783
02:48:52,200 --> 02:49:04,600
Oh, it's from an anime.

2784
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:04,840
Okay.

2785
02:49:10,229 --> 02:49:10,629
Where's...

2786
02:49:10,629 --> 02:49:11,430
There's too many skins.

2787
02:49:11,430 --> 02:49:12,229
Where's Archon?

2788
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:13,909
Demonic.

2789
02:49:14,709 --> 02:49:15,110
Golden.

2790
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:16,709
There's no Archon.

2791
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,479
Soul Harvester.

2792
02:49:19,479 --> 02:49:19,879
Reaper.

2793
02:49:20,799 --> 02:49:21,600
Final Boss.

2794
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:23,489
Jack the Reaper.

2795
02:49:24,229 --> 02:49:24,709
Obey.

2796
02:49:25,350 --> 02:49:27,299
Grim Reaper.

2797
02:49:27,299 --> 02:49:27,620
Sci...

2798
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:28,659
Where is this?

2799
02:49:28,659 --> 02:49:35,010
Ruby Rose.

2800
02:49:35,569 --> 02:49:36,770
Classic Ruby Rose.

2801
02:49:36,770 --> 02:49:37,489
There's a classic.

2802
02:49:38,209 --> 02:49:39,780
I skipped the only good one.

2803
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,559
Where's Archon?

2804
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:52,930
Are you guys lying?

2805
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:53,170
Oh.

2806
02:49:59,299 --> 02:50:00,239
Okay.

2807
02:50:00,239 --> 02:50:00,719
What does it do?

2808
02:50:02,790 --> 02:50:04,530
Oh.

2809
02:50:04,530 --> 02:50:05,969
Level 1 minion.

2810
02:50:05,969 --> 02:50:07,010
Level 15 boss.

2811
02:50:07,809 --> 02:50:09,170
Level 30 boss.

2812
02:50:09,170 --> 02:50:21,540
That's cool.

2813
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,069
All right.

2814
02:50:24,069 --> 02:50:24,870
I want to see if one...

2815
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:26,610
Where...

2816
02:50:30,899 --> 02:50:31,860
Who's the guy that goes,

2817
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:32,579
Stick around.

2818
02:50:36,819 --> 02:50:38,579
Stick around.

2819
02:50:38,579 --> 02:50:40,920
And who's the guy that goes,

2820
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,079
Buttery.

2821
02:50:43,719 --> 02:50:44,440
Crispy.

2822
02:50:44,440 --> 02:50:45,239
Crust.

2823
02:50:45,239 --> 02:50:46,899
Flaky.

2824
02:50:49,379 --> 02:50:51,319
Crispy.

2825
02:50:51,319 --> 02:50:51,959
Buttery.

2826
02:50:51,959 --> 02:50:52,440
Flaky.

2827
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:53,159
Buttery.

2828
02:50:53,159 --> 02:50:53,559
Crispy.

2829
02:50:53,559 --> 02:50:54,280
Crust.

2830
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:58,209
Is Mario?

2831
02:50:58,209 --> 02:50:59,090
No, it's not.

2832
02:50:59,090 --> 02:51:09,319
It's not Peter Griffin.

2833
02:51:09,319 --> 02:51:10,280
If you don't know that video,

2834
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:11,399
then holy shit.

2835
02:51:11,399 --> 02:51:11,879
Come on.

2836
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:14,290
Have you ever used the internet?

2837
02:51:14,290 --> 02:51:16,049
Guys, I'm the one that's not supposed to be...

2838
02:51:16,049 --> 02:51:17,809
I don't know about the memes and shit.

2839
02:51:17,809 --> 02:51:18,370
You...

2840
02:51:18,370 --> 02:51:20,639
Come on.

2841
02:51:20,639 --> 02:51:24,319
Sylvanas there.

2842
02:51:25,059 --> 02:51:25,459
Yeah.

2843
02:51:25,459 --> 02:51:26,260
He goes,

2844
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:26,899
Sylvanas!

2845
02:51:36,370 --> 02:51:37,090
Bob Ross.

2846
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:45,879
Okay.

2847
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:48,629
What's this?

2848
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:54,319
They got a spoiled Stranger Things.

2849
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:57,969
This is a...

2850
02:51:57,969 --> 02:51:59,489
I think I just spoiled the show.

2851
02:51:59,489 --> 02:52:00,370
I've never seen it.

2852
02:52:00,370 --> 02:52:11,750
What did you want me to see here?

2853
02:52:19,969 --> 02:52:22,340
Okay.

2854
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:23,219
Now I want to see Splinter,

2855
02:52:23,219 --> 02:52:23,940
and I want to see Shredder,

2856
02:52:23,940 --> 02:52:25,139
and then we can keep playing.

2857
02:52:25,139 --> 02:52:26,200
Hachiman.

2858
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:26,840
Okay.

2859
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:30,559
Hachiman.

2860
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:33,600
Where is Hachiman's skin?

2861
02:52:34,239 --> 02:52:34,719
What is this?

2862
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:43,959
It's a really good furry OC.

2863
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:47,959
Okay.

2864
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:49,000
Oh yeah.

2865
02:52:53,729 --> 02:52:54,610
There he is.

2866
02:52:54,610 --> 02:52:55,329
Master Splinter.

2867
02:53:00,229 --> 02:53:06,739
I want this.

2868
02:53:07,379 --> 02:53:09,799
Would you guys judge me if I bought this?

2869
02:53:09,799 --> 02:53:13,319
How much would I get judged?

2870
02:53:16,229 --> 02:53:18,579
What does that actually translate to for money?

2871
02:53:18,579 --> 02:53:22,629
No.

2872
02:53:22,629 --> 02:53:23,750
We already judged you already.

2873
02:53:23,750 --> 02:53:23,909
All right.

2874
02:53:23,909 --> 02:53:25,030
So that's Hachiman.

2875
02:53:25,030 --> 02:53:26,069
Where's Shredder?

2876
02:53:26,069 --> 02:53:32,399
Buy it on your main account.

2877
02:53:32,399 --> 02:53:34,469
That's also pretty true.

2878
02:53:34,469 --> 02:53:38,069
Ravana.

2879
02:53:38,069 --> 02:53:39,829
Yeah.

2880
02:53:39,829 --> 02:53:41,190
I really shouldn't buy anything on this account

2881
02:53:41,190 --> 02:53:42,549
besides the god pack.

2882
02:53:42,549 --> 02:53:55,969
All right.

2883
02:53:55,969 --> 02:53:56,450
There it is.

2884
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:01,680
That's pretty cool.

2885
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:05,399
Completed.

2886
02:54:07,319 --> 02:54:08,440
I was just going to say something,

2887
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:09,959
and then I realized that I could just play

2888
02:54:09,959 --> 02:54:11,559
the Nickelodeon All-Stars game,

2889
02:54:11,559 --> 02:54:12,520
because I was about to say,

2890
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,879
imagine a game like this,

2891
02:54:13,879 --> 02:54:16,440
but it's just like old cartoon characters,

2892
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:17,879
and like Nickelodeon characters,

2893
02:54:17,879 --> 02:54:19,319
and like Disney characters.

2894
02:54:19,319 --> 02:54:22,520
Krang is in the game too.

2895
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:27,920
There are enough old cartoons and old stuff

2896
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:29,280
to be able to make a smite,

2897
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:30,159
but instead of gods,

2898
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:31,360
it's just old characters.

2899
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:37,200
Let's see.

2900
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:41,399
Is Krang in the game?

2901
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:44,319
Oh my god.

2902
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:45,440
It's actually in the game.

2903
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:50,739
I have to buy this.

2904
02:54:51,969 --> 02:54:52,290
What?

2905
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:57,559
You're going to make Krang

2906
02:54:57,559 --> 02:54:59,239
an exclusive special promotion?

2907
02:55:12,149 --> 02:55:13,989
Krang is Twitch Prime giveaway.

2908
02:55:16,069 --> 02:55:16,309
Oh.

2909
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:18,629
Krang is free with Twitch Prime.

2910
02:55:18,629 --> 02:55:20,229
I don't want to link my Twitch Prime to this.

2911
02:55:21,959 --> 02:55:22,600
Not this one.

2912
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:26,020
All right.

2913
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:26,659
Cool.

2914
02:55:26,659 --> 02:55:27,620
Super cool.

2915
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:29,000
What about Nuwa?

2916
02:55:32,389 --> 02:55:37,969
Where's Nuwa?

2917
02:55:37,969 --> 02:55:39,170
Nuwa.

2918
02:55:39,170 --> 02:55:40,389
Nuwa.

2919
02:55:40,389 --> 02:55:42,209
Okay.

2920
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:52,309
This is a League character.

2921
02:55:53,030 --> 02:56:00,530
Is there a Ninja Turtles character?

2922
02:56:00,530 --> 02:56:02,290
Or a Nickelodeon character?

2923
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:07,409
Okay.

2924
02:56:07,409 --> 02:56:08,290
Well, that was...

2925
02:56:11,059 --> 02:56:14,200
This one's $3,600.

2926
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:25,700
All right.

2927
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:30,040
Well, what about Jeb?

2928
02:56:33,219 --> 02:56:35,059
What does Jeb have for skins?

2929
02:56:35,059 --> 02:56:36,739
Oh, Frosty the Snowman.

2930
02:56:36,739 --> 02:56:39,510
This is my favorite skin in the game.

2931
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:41,350
$1,200?

2932
02:56:47,909 --> 02:56:49,510
Yeah, I think I have to get a Jeb.

2933
02:56:51,270 --> 02:56:53,319
What about this one?

2934
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:57,680
Interesting.

2935
02:56:59,139 --> 02:56:59,780
What is that?

2936
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:06,239
Jeb is cool.

2937
02:57:08,870 --> 02:57:09,989
The earth moves.

2938
02:57:09,989 --> 02:57:10,950
I'm playing Jeb next game.

2939
02:57:15,090 --> 02:57:15,969
Excuse me, Jeb.

2940
02:57:15,969 --> 02:57:17,250
We're going to play as Jeb.

2941
02:57:17,250 --> 02:57:18,479
All right.

2942
02:57:18,479 --> 02:57:19,520
We're going to do Arena.

2943
02:57:20,340 --> 02:57:32,200
Get ready for Arena.

2944
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:32,680
Arena.

2945
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:36,520
Blind pick is what we want, right?

2946
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:39,620
Diving level three?

2947
02:57:41,239 --> 02:57:42,120
Pause type none.

2948
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:47,559
Jeb sucks in Arena.

2949
02:57:47,559 --> 02:57:48,040
That's true.

2950
02:57:48,040 --> 02:57:48,440
Never mind.

2951
02:57:50,319 --> 02:57:50,719
All right.

2952
02:57:50,719 --> 02:57:51,440
I'm going to make...

2953
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:51,840
You know what?

2954
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:52,559
Let's really go for this.

2955
02:57:52,559 --> 02:57:54,159
I'm going to make this password very hard.

2956
02:57:54,159 --> 02:57:55,680
Let's see if anybody can get this.

2957
02:57:55,680 --> 02:58:00,739
I bet that somebody would be able to get.

2958
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:03,239
I don't know.

2959
02:58:03,239 --> 02:58:03,639
I wonder.

2960
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:13,989
What would I do?

2961
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:15,909
Something very hard.

2962
02:58:16,629 --> 02:58:29,239
Okay.

2963
02:58:29,239 --> 02:58:30,200
If somebody gets this,

2964
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:34,440
that's really weird that we're on the same kind of plane of existence, right?

2965
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:37,860
Looks good.

2966
02:58:38,420 --> 02:58:48,180
It swallowed really weirdly and it hurt.

2967
02:58:51,030 --> 02:58:52,069
Will somebody get this?

2968
02:58:56,520 --> 02:58:57,319
If somebody gets this,

2969
02:58:57,319 --> 02:58:58,520
if more than one or two people get this,

2970
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:13,559
this is just proof to make sure you have a good password.

2971
02:59:13,559 --> 02:59:14,040
A hint?

2972
02:59:14,680 --> 02:59:15,239
Okay.

2973
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:18,079
It is food related.

2974
02:59:18,719 --> 02:59:22,069
This is a food related item

2975
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:25,299
and it can sit in your pantry.

2976
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:27,520
Does not need to be refrigerated.

2977
02:59:28,159 --> 02:59:32,930
You would classify this as a snack.

2978
02:59:41,360 --> 02:59:44,719
And the main ingredient in this comes from a cow.

2979
02:59:44,719 --> 03:00:00,520
By the way, I spelled it wrong.

2980
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:02,120
Now that we're thinking and we're doing this.

2981
03:00:07,399 --> 03:00:22,799
The password is Cheez-It with no spaces, no capitals.

2982
03:00:22,799 --> 03:00:24,239
And it's not the brand name.

2983
03:00:24,239 --> 03:00:30,040
It's Cheez-It.

2984
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:30,840
Whoops.

2985
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:41,780
Have you seen Gas Station Simulator?

2986
03:00:43,540 --> 03:00:44,100
I have.

2987
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:45,319
I was thinking about it.

2988
03:00:47,809 --> 03:00:48,659
All right.

2989
03:00:48,659 --> 03:00:49,299
What is it?

2990
03:00:49,299 --> 03:00:50,420
What does it move?

2991
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:59,350
That was cool.

2992
03:00:59,350 --> 03:00:59,670
All right.

2993
03:01:03,030 --> 03:01:04,209
This is a arena.

2994
03:01:04,209 --> 03:01:04,610
Probably good.

2995
03:01:04,610 --> 03:01:05,010
He's a mage.

2996
03:01:05,409 --> 03:01:07,379
What about Jeb?

2997
03:01:07,940 --> 03:01:09,219
Jeb is very bad.

2998
03:01:09,219 --> 03:01:10,420
You have the Jeb skin.

2999
03:01:10,899 --> 03:01:13,520
Oh, you guys have the cool skins.

3000
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:14,399
You have the frog skin.

3001
03:01:14,959 --> 03:01:23,200
Click the icon on the left to see moves.

3002
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:26,709
Oh, here we go.

3003
03:01:26,709 --> 03:01:29,219
All right.

3004
03:01:29,219 --> 03:01:32,340
Baron shares Baron's Brew, a powerful restorative chalice

3005
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:33,780
with his allies from the item shop.

3006
03:01:34,340 --> 03:01:37,600
Enemies hit by Baron will have hysteria applied to them.

3007
03:01:38,159 --> 03:01:39,700
Baron's abilities interact with hysteria

3008
03:01:39,700 --> 03:01:42,500
to provide bonus effects, targets, and max hysteria

3009
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:47,280
from the item shop?

3010
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:51,200
Okay.

3011
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:52,879
So you have to hit people to get hysteria.

3012
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:57,250
I've seen this before.

3013
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:59,010
You put the mirror down and it's just me.

3014
03:01:59,649 --> 03:02:05,239
This one is god.

3015
03:02:05,239 --> 03:02:05,799
Okay.

3016
03:02:05,799 --> 03:02:06,360
Whatever.

3017
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:07,399
I'll figure it out.

3018
03:02:07,399 --> 03:02:12,370
Well, this is kind of like the Anubis wrap.

3019
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:21,879
Baron's Brew is a multi-potion that you can only get on him.

3020
03:02:21,879 --> 03:02:22,360
Oh, okay.

3021
03:02:25,569 --> 03:02:27,489
Add me on Cookie Run Kingdom.

3022
03:02:27,489 --> 03:02:40,920
I sounded kind of rude, but I don't play it.

3023
03:02:47,239 --> 03:02:49,190
All right.

3024
03:02:49,190 --> 03:02:49,670
So let me see.

3025
03:02:50,389 --> 03:02:53,110
So that's kind of like a little grab like Anubis.

3026
03:02:53,110 --> 03:02:53,590
What's this one?

3027
03:02:55,569 --> 03:02:57,729
That's this is what I like.

3028
03:02:57,729 --> 03:02:58,049
This thing.

3029
03:02:58,049 --> 03:02:59,409
You go boom, bam, the two beams.

3030
03:03:00,290 --> 03:03:00,530
All right.

3031
03:03:00,530 --> 03:03:02,930
So just a hit with abilities and then it does more damage.

3032
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:04,069
Easy.

3033
03:03:04,629 --> 03:03:04,870
Simple.

3034
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:09,750
Where's that potion?

3035
03:03:10,309 --> 03:03:12,020
Where's Baron's Brew?

3036
03:03:12,579 --> 03:03:14,530
He was 140.

3037
03:03:14,530 --> 03:03:15,010
Oh, shit.

3038
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:15,809
That's actually really good.

3039
03:03:17,809 --> 03:03:18,129
Nice.

3040
03:03:19,090 --> 03:03:21,680
This dreamer hates his fans.

3041
03:03:36,530 --> 03:03:41,590
There's a shark?

3042
03:03:42,399 --> 03:03:43,760
That's an awesome Sobex skin.

3043
03:03:44,319 --> 03:03:50,920
I'll take the damage.

3044
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:51,799
Why not?

3045
03:03:51,799 --> 03:04:04,559
All right.

3046
03:04:04,559 --> 03:04:05,040
Let's get it.

3047
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:13,010
Learning the moves.

3048
03:04:13,010 --> 03:04:13,889
Just getting the feel for it.

3049
03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:15,639
Don't stand near me.

3050
03:04:21,649 --> 03:04:22,129
Immune.

3051
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:28,819
I go back.

3052
03:04:29,379 --> 03:04:31,040
Throw it up the graphics.

3053
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:32,000
Everything's on maximum.

3054
03:04:32,559 --> 03:04:36,920
Turn up.

3055
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:38,360
Everything is on max.

3056
03:04:40,069 --> 03:04:40,950
Two is a heal.

3057
03:04:40,950 --> 03:04:46,920
Oh, it looks like 720p.

3058
03:04:48,549 --> 03:04:50,549
You're watching it in 720.

3059
03:04:50,549 --> 03:04:51,590
It is 720p.

3060
03:04:51,590 --> 03:04:52,629
It's being downscaled.

3061
03:04:53,350 --> 03:05:04,639
Well, 864p.

3062
03:05:04,639 --> 03:05:04,879
Sorry.

3063
03:05:04,879 --> 03:05:07,440
Wait, we have to help our friends over here.

3064
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:13,780
I don't know what this does.

3065
03:05:14,420 --> 03:05:18,100
That was cool.

3066
03:05:18,659 --> 03:05:19,399
Whatever it did.

3067
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:32,520
Are you sure you bought a legitimate 3090?

3068
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:34,600
Would I have like a bootleg 3090?

3069
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:38,309
Taped over the side.

3070
03:05:38,309 --> 03:05:39,510
It's like a 1060.

3071
03:05:47,239 --> 03:05:47,719
Oh, fuck.

3072
03:05:47,719 --> 03:05:48,200
That's bad.

3073
03:05:52,739 --> 03:05:53,620
That's bad.

3074
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:57,829
Why can't you stream in 1080?

3075
03:05:58,389 --> 03:06:00,819
This question comes up pretty frequently.

3076
03:06:00,819 --> 03:06:02,340
But something that we have to keep discussing.

3077
03:06:03,139 --> 03:06:04,040
I will explain it.

3078
03:06:04,040 --> 03:06:04,760
I'll tell you again.

3079
03:06:05,649 --> 03:06:13,620
So Twitch only allows you to have a bit rate of 6,000 upload bit rate.

3080
03:06:14,899 --> 03:06:22,500
A full 1080p video at 6,000 bit rate and 60 fps does not look very good.

3081
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:23,540
It's not enough.

3082
03:06:23,540 --> 03:06:28,819
The reason why most people stream in 720 or like 860 whatever

3083
03:06:29,379 --> 03:06:33,379
is because that 720 video looks okay at 6,000.

3084
03:06:41,409 --> 03:06:42,209
It's 8k.

3085
03:06:42,209 --> 03:06:42,690
It is not.

3086
03:06:43,329 --> 03:06:45,989
Okay.

3087
03:06:45,989 --> 03:06:47,270
Now I'm going to play the game again.

3088
03:06:51,219 --> 03:06:54,500
Now what people do is they might have a second computer

3089
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:55,780
that they run the whole thing through

3090
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:58,420
and they have it on the slowest preset possible for their CPU.

3091
03:06:59,409 --> 03:07:01,969
But if you look at the research,

3092
03:07:01,969 --> 03:07:04,610
like the things that people have done on testing,

3093
03:07:05,489 --> 03:07:09,809
once you go from medium down to slow for the CPU preset,

3094
03:07:09,809 --> 03:07:15,969
you can't even really tell a difference.

3095
03:07:15,969 --> 03:07:19,489
Until we can stream at like 10,000 to 15,000 bit rate up,

3096
03:07:20,129 --> 03:07:22,280
1080, 60 fps is not...

3097
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:23,319
All right.

3098
03:07:23,319 --> 03:07:23,879
All right.

3099
03:07:23,879 --> 03:07:24,280
Whatever.

3100
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:24,760
You get it.

3101
03:07:24,760 --> 03:07:25,719
Who cares?

3102
03:07:25,719 --> 03:07:26,280
Who cares?

3103
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:26,680
I'm done.

3104
03:07:27,719 --> 03:07:34,280
Everyone's calling me a nerd.

3105
03:07:42,209 --> 03:07:43,649
What is this person doing back here?

3106
03:07:44,450 --> 03:07:46,959
He's a tech guy.

3107
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:57,649
I have not hit that fucking one time.

3108
03:08:02,229 --> 03:08:02,469
All right.

3109
03:08:02,469 --> 03:08:04,229
Let me have a non-embarrassing game.

3110
03:08:04,870 --> 03:08:05,700
Excuse me.

3111
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:36,079
It's still close.

3112
03:08:36,079 --> 03:08:36,559
All right.

3113
03:08:36,559 --> 03:08:37,440
Let me pull this together.

3114
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:52,120
I'm just hitting the same guy.

3115
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:57,799
Thank God.

3116
03:09:00,950 --> 03:09:02,709
He's going to destroy his PC in a rage.

3117
03:09:15,940 --> 03:09:16,979
What the hell are you saying?

3118
03:09:22,799 --> 03:09:23,840
Be toxic this game?

3119
03:09:27,190 --> 03:09:27,750
Why?

3120
03:09:27,750 --> 03:09:28,629
I don't want to be toxic.

3121
03:09:28,629 --> 03:09:29,190
I want to just play.

3122
03:09:29,829 --> 03:09:36,579
Get this guy away from me.

3123
03:09:42,629 --> 03:09:43,110
Come here!

3124
03:09:49,059 --> 03:09:49,780
Oh my goodness.

3125
03:09:49,780 --> 03:09:53,280
This guy, this wrestler.

3126
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:53,840
Oh my God.

3127
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:55,200
Am I joking him?

3128
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:55,680
I joked him.

3129
03:09:55,680 --> 03:09:56,079
Holy shit.

3130
03:09:56,079 --> 03:09:56,399
I win.

3131
03:10:06,690 --> 03:10:07,329
More cooldown?

3132
03:10:07,329 --> 03:10:08,290
What do you think?

3133
03:10:08,290 --> 03:10:13,969
Yeah.

3134
03:10:13,969 --> 03:10:14,370
This one.

3135
03:10:16,450 --> 03:10:21,299
I like sprint.

3136
03:10:21,299 --> 03:10:21,540
I know.

3137
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:22,020
I'm a noob.

3138
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:38,389
This is different actors saying the same line auditioning for the same role.

3139
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:53,440
That was really toxic kind of.

3140
03:10:53,440 --> 03:10:54,719
No, that's not what I'm trying to do.

3141
03:10:54,719 --> 03:10:55,680
What is this person doing?

3142
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:07,319
Suck him in.

3143
03:11:07,319 --> 03:11:08,040
I don't even know what this does.

3144
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:15,489
All right.

3145
03:11:15,489 --> 03:11:16,770
What does that actually do?

3146
03:11:16,770 --> 03:11:17,329
What does this do?

3147
03:11:18,639 --> 03:11:19,040
Jesus.

3148
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:20,719
This is a god damn...

3149
03:11:20,719 --> 03:11:22,159
140 characters Twitter.

3150
03:11:22,159 --> 03:11:22,719
What the fuck?

3151
03:11:23,280 --> 03:11:26,639
Baron pulls the soul of living towards his coffin becoming immune to crowd control.

3152
03:11:26,639 --> 03:11:26,879
Okay.

3153
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:30,709
So I take 35% less damage.

3154
03:11:31,270 --> 03:11:33,520
Enemies within the range are caught in a vortex.

3155
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:37,520
Dragging them towards the coffin and taking damage every 30.33 seconds.

3156
03:11:38,159 --> 03:11:41,360
When enemy god gets too close, their soul is ripped out.

3157
03:11:41,360 --> 03:11:43,040
They get stunned and they take a lot of damage.

3158
03:11:44,549 --> 03:11:44,790
Okay.

3159
03:11:44,790 --> 03:11:45,190
I got it.

3160
03:11:48,659 --> 03:11:50,850
Ice award for teleport.

3161
03:11:51,409 --> 03:11:52,530
Ice award for teleport.

3162
03:11:53,329 --> 03:11:54,610
Ice award for teleport.

3163
03:11:59,670 --> 03:12:01,799
You're just gonna let that go in?

3164
03:12:01,799 --> 03:12:02,680
Stop reading.

3165
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:03,159
What?

3166
03:12:03,159 --> 03:12:03,799
Oh my god.

3167
03:12:03,799 --> 03:12:04,600
What's with you guys?

3168
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:16,600
Nice.

3169
03:12:17,239 --> 03:12:22,719
Get out of here.

3170
03:12:22,719 --> 03:12:23,520
Get away from me.

3171
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:24,319
I don't like this guy.

3172
03:12:24,959 --> 03:12:30,579
Let's go.

3173
03:12:30,579 --> 03:12:39,299
Let's work.

3174
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:50,389
We gotta kill this guy.

3175
03:12:50,389 --> 03:12:51,590
Oh, come the fuck on.

3176
03:12:51,590 --> 03:12:52,389
Kill him.

3177
03:12:52,389 --> 03:12:53,350
Oh my goodness.

3178
03:12:54,870 --> 03:12:55,110
Run.

3179
03:13:01,569 --> 03:13:01,889
What?

3180
03:13:10,879 --> 03:13:11,120
No.

3181
03:13:12,399 --> 03:13:13,860
He's the tank.

3182
03:13:13,860 --> 03:13:14,579
Stop shooting him.

3183
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:24,979
Yeah, I wanna reduce the healing on that Hercules.

3184
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:27,559
It's still anybody's game.

3185
03:13:30,600 --> 03:13:31,479
I'm not gonna do that.

3186
03:13:31,479 --> 03:13:32,200
I'm not the tank.

3187
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:42,229
Here he comes.

3188
03:13:42,229 --> 03:13:42,870
Get away from me.

3189
03:13:43,750 --> 03:13:44,709
That's not fun.

3190
03:13:44,709 --> 03:13:45,350
It's not fair.

3191
03:13:46,659 --> 03:13:47,299
Game's not fair.

3192
03:13:58,639 --> 03:13:59,200
Build boots.

3193
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:06,479
Why are we even attacking this guy?

3194
03:14:06,479 --> 03:14:07,040
He's just here.

3195
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:13,639
This guy.

3196
03:14:13,639 --> 03:14:14,520
Get out of here.

3197
03:14:15,639 --> 03:14:16,760
Nobody get this guy.

3198
03:14:20,209 --> 03:14:22,610
Why do I just hear a school cafeteria full of people?

3199
03:14:26,040 --> 03:14:27,000
Don't let him get away with that.

3200
03:14:27,639 --> 03:14:37,780
Oh, I got a ball on the fucking vortex.

3201
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:40,979
Oh shit.

3202
03:14:40,979 --> 03:14:41,379
Oh shit.

3203
03:14:41,379 --> 03:14:41,780
Oh shit.

3204
03:14:42,420 --> 03:14:44,930
Oh shit.

3205
03:14:45,569 --> 03:14:47,319
Oh shit.

3206
03:14:47,959 --> 03:14:48,360
Oh.

3207
03:15:00,079 --> 03:15:01,120
I thought they were gonna keep walking.

3208
03:15:27,239 --> 03:15:30,600
Stop fucking.

3209
03:15:30,600 --> 03:15:31,239
Oh my god.

3210
03:15:31,239 --> 03:15:31,959
What am I doing?

3211
03:15:31,959 --> 03:15:32,200
Sprint.

3212
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:41,299
Oh, I had to be like stupid and make a dumb little joke.

3213
03:15:43,059 --> 03:15:43,540
All right.

3214
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:45,860
Next time I'm gonna play a god that I know what their moves do.

3215
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:47,299
Okay.

3216
03:15:47,299 --> 03:15:54,920
Streaming smite and picking a god I've never played with before is probably a bad idea,

3217
03:15:55,639 --> 03:15:56,930
but this is a good idea.

3218
03:15:57,729 --> 03:16:14,450
Immune.

3219
03:16:22,579 --> 03:16:25,840
All right.

3220
03:16:26,399 --> 03:16:26,959
All right.

3221
03:16:26,959 --> 03:16:27,360
What do you say?

3222
03:16:27,360 --> 03:16:27,840
Let's pull back.

3223
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:38,319
Let's go.

3224
03:16:38,319 --> 03:16:38,799
Back it up.

3225
03:16:38,799 --> 03:16:39,120
Back it up.

3226
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:39,520
Back it up.

3227
03:16:39,520 --> 03:16:39,760
Bad.

3228
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:40,000
Bad.

3229
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,559
This is a bad idea.

3230
03:16:41,280 --> 03:16:46,530
Oh my god.

3231
03:16:46,530 --> 03:16:47,809
That Hercules is running right at me.

3232
03:16:51,090 --> 03:16:51,889
Ice drop so bad.

3233
03:16:51,889 --> 03:16:52,129
Good.

3234
03:16:52,690 --> 03:17:02,790
All right.

3235
03:17:02,790 --> 03:17:03,270
I want to do...

3236
03:17:04,149 --> 03:17:05,620
Well, cool down.

3237
03:17:06,260 --> 03:17:08,479
Yeah.

3238
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:08,879
Cool down.

3239
03:17:09,440 --> 03:17:12,520
Ooh.

3240
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:13,959
That's penetration and cool down.

3241
03:17:13,959 --> 03:17:14,360
Hell yeah.

3242
03:17:14,840 --> 03:17:16,360
I don't even read the paragraph underneath it.

3243
03:17:17,159 --> 03:17:18,260
Just hit me.

3244
03:17:18,819 --> 03:17:26,120
I just absolutely smashed that cube in the face.

3245
03:17:26,920 --> 03:17:41,909
Oh, come on.

3246
03:17:41,909 --> 03:17:42,790
He's so low.

3247
03:17:42,790 --> 03:17:44,629
No, we can't have that.

3248
03:17:45,350 --> 03:17:57,559
City and shards second item.

3249
03:17:57,559 --> 03:17:59,000
I don't know.

3250
03:17:59,000 --> 03:17:59,719
I look...

3251
03:17:59,719 --> 03:18:00,840
This is why I'm playing arena.

3252
03:18:07,860 --> 03:18:08,739
Is that a beach ball?

3253
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:17,059
You're gonna play tribes ascend?

3254
03:18:18,629 --> 03:18:23,190
Tribes ascend really is probably one of the best FPS games that's ever been made,

3255
03:18:24,979 --> 03:18:27,780
but I wasn't a big fan of all the grenade shit.

3256
03:18:32,389 --> 03:18:39,440
That game's long range skill shots is some of the most satisfying dopamine inducing gaming

3257
03:18:39,440 --> 03:18:41,200
ever that I've ever played in my entire life.

3258
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:42,680
All right.

3259
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:43,079
This guy.

3260
03:18:43,799 --> 03:18:48,000
Thank you.

3261
03:19:06,260 --> 03:19:06,819
Stop dying.

3262
03:19:06,819 --> 03:19:07,860
I'm drinking a big soda.

3263
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:09,860
Every death is almost like you're trying to make me burp.

3264
03:19:09,860 --> 03:19:10,100
What?

3265
03:19:10,899 --> 03:19:18,950
All right.

3266
03:19:18,950 --> 03:19:21,110
I'm gonna play a character that I know what their moves are.

3267
03:19:23,989 --> 03:19:26,579
I'm gonna hear that in my dreams.

3268
03:19:27,299 --> 03:19:29,520
Place a ward for teleport.

3269
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:31,920
Place a ward for teleport.

3270
03:19:32,879 --> 03:19:41,299
Again, another one.

3271
03:19:41,299 --> 03:19:48,530
We're going conquest.

3272
03:19:48,530 --> 03:20:01,600
You guys ready?

3273
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:01,840
Okay.

3274
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:08,000
I have to play the easiest thing.

3275
03:20:08,639 --> 03:20:18,610
What's the solo lane the easiest still?

3276
03:20:18,610 --> 03:20:19,569
No, not support.

3277
03:20:19,569 --> 03:20:19,969
No way.

3278
03:20:20,610 --> 03:20:22,360
Do you mercury impression?

3279
03:20:22,360 --> 03:20:22,760
Sure thing.

3280
03:20:23,799 --> 03:20:24,819
Mercury!

3281
03:20:24,819 --> 03:20:25,379
Mercury!

3282
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:29,479
Hank Arthur solo is fun.

3283
03:20:29,479 --> 03:20:31,760
Solo I think I could do.

3284
03:20:31,760 --> 03:20:32,159
Mid?

3285
03:20:32,159 --> 03:20:39,719
Yeah, I'll do mid.

3286
03:20:39,719 --> 03:20:40,280
All right.

3287
03:20:40,280 --> 03:20:44,920
Here we go.

3288
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:47,040
Password.

3289
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:48,079
Yeah, I'll do mid.

3290
03:20:48,079 --> 03:20:50,319
Not doing solo.

3291
03:20:53,860 --> 03:21:02,479
Very good.

3292
03:21:02,479 --> 03:21:03,760
Nice job.

3293
03:21:03,760 --> 03:21:15,299
You all have very good listening skills.

3294
03:21:15,299 --> 03:21:19,860
Password is I'll go mid with no spaces, no capitals.

3295
03:21:19,860 --> 03:21:20,979
I didn't have to even say it.

3296
03:21:29,010 --> 03:21:30,530
All right, guys, you ready?

3297
03:21:31,520 --> 03:21:32,239
I need to be mid.

3298
03:21:35,559 --> 03:21:36,040
I'm mid.

3299
03:21:37,540 --> 03:21:40,100
Now the question is who should I play with in mid?

3300
03:21:43,670 --> 03:22:00,079
It's either gonna be Anubis, Kronos, Olken, not Hades.

3301
03:22:00,079 --> 03:22:02,559
No, I'm not confident enough to play this game that way.

3302
03:22:02,559 --> 03:22:05,219
It's gonna be Kronos.

3303
03:22:05,219 --> 03:22:20,319
Kronos is ADC.

3304
03:22:20,319 --> 03:22:21,120
No, he's not.

3305
03:22:21,120 --> 03:22:28,239
It's unfair because people are brute forcing the password with quantum computing.

3306
03:22:28,799 --> 03:23:00,760
I was gonna say it's like tag.

3307
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:09,399
Kronos is not hard.

3308
03:23:09,399 --> 03:23:10,659
Kronos is fun.

3309
03:23:14,290 --> 03:23:16,610
I love playing Kronos because you just kind of ski around and go

3310
03:23:18,610 --> 03:23:19,569
with attack speed.

3311
03:23:19,569 --> 03:23:25,879
He has some of the best sound effects in the game.

3312
03:23:25,879 --> 03:23:27,569
You guys all play.

3313
03:23:27,569 --> 03:23:29,729
Why are people talking to me like they don't play this game?

3314
03:23:30,450 --> 03:23:33,329
You have to have a thousand games on each one of these characters.

3315
03:23:33,329 --> 03:23:34,530
You guys play this game.

3316
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:36,959
A shitload of you guys play this game all the time.

3317
03:23:40,319 --> 03:23:42,000
Oh, I forgot this was an arena.

3318
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:42,879
I just pressed one.

3319
03:23:42,879 --> 03:23:43,200
Whoops.

3320
03:23:45,159 --> 03:23:45,479
All right.

3321
03:23:45,479 --> 03:23:46,680
How do I play Conquest?

3322
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:47,479
You guys have to carry me.

3323
03:23:51,090 --> 03:23:52,290
Okay, you owe me 1500 gold.

3324
03:23:57,440 --> 03:23:58,399
What do I buy?

3325
03:23:58,399 --> 03:24:01,479
There's no boots.

3326
03:24:02,360 --> 03:24:04,100
I'm just gonna do this.

3327
03:24:04,100 --> 03:24:05,459
This is attack speed and this is okay.

3328
03:24:07,620 --> 03:24:09,200
Are these free?

3329
03:24:09,200 --> 03:24:21,639
Yeah, Kronos is a lot of fun.

3330
03:24:21,639 --> 03:24:23,799
I know that you have to I have to go get the buffs, right?

3331
03:24:23,799 --> 03:24:24,440
And help people.

3332
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:40,100
I don't know anything about rotating the ultimate.

3333
03:24:40,100 --> 03:24:45,600
And why doesn't Smite do stuff like this?

3334
03:24:45,600 --> 03:24:48,239
Just get like a bunch of really good like pro players.

3335
03:24:48,239 --> 03:24:51,840
And then one like eight year old that plays mid.

3336
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:57,719
All right, here we go.

3337
03:25:04,290 --> 03:25:07,889
One of the reasons why I like Smite is because last hitting really is not make or break the whole game.

3338
03:25:08,610 --> 03:25:10,690
It adds a little bit, but it's not the worst thing in the world.

3339
03:25:19,489 --> 03:25:20,209
All right, okay.

3340
03:25:20,770 --> 03:25:24,530
I think that's free, right?

3341
03:25:24,530 --> 03:25:31,540
Here they come, here they come.

3342
03:25:31,540 --> 03:25:32,579
I don't even know how to say anything.

3343
03:25:32,579 --> 03:25:33,379
Wait, I'm streaming.

3344
03:25:34,739 --> 03:25:45,319
Watch out.

3345
03:25:45,319 --> 03:25:45,879
Save yourself.

3346
03:25:45,879 --> 03:25:56,290
They can hear me talking.

3347
03:25:56,290 --> 03:25:56,850
Yeah, I can.

3348
03:25:56,850 --> 03:25:57,569
This is fine.

3349
03:25:57,569 --> 03:25:59,170
I don't have to do any like VGS or anything.

3350
03:26:01,600 --> 03:26:02,879
Athena's going left.

3351
03:26:02,879 --> 03:26:04,709
Athena going left lane.

3352
03:26:11,540 --> 03:26:12,420
Gank coming middle lane.

3353
03:26:12,420 --> 03:26:13,459
Gank incoming middle lane.

3354
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:15,219
Gank incoming.

3355
03:26:17,239 --> 03:26:17,479
Fuck.

3356
03:26:26,739 --> 03:26:28,020
This is gonna be a long match.

3357
03:26:32,739 --> 03:26:34,500
I don't even have enough money to buy anything.

3358
03:26:34,500 --> 03:26:36,120
I need wards, right?

3359
03:26:36,120 --> 03:26:37,479
No, that's not my job.

3360
03:26:37,479 --> 03:26:45,399
I don't know what my job is.

3361
03:26:45,399 --> 03:26:46,920
All right, that's fine.

3362
03:26:46,920 --> 03:26:47,639
Nice work.

3363
03:26:47,639 --> 03:26:55,700
Remember the other team can hear you too.

3364
03:26:55,700 --> 03:26:58,440
That's right.

3365
03:26:58,440 --> 03:27:00,920
Oh shit, this is a bad like kind of leak.

3366
03:27:07,510 --> 03:27:08,309
Thank you.

3367
03:27:08,309 --> 03:27:18,930
All right, back to it.

3368
03:27:18,930 --> 03:27:32,309
What was that?

3369
03:27:32,309 --> 03:27:34,629
Enemy is continuing to be in middle lane.

3370
03:27:34,629 --> 03:27:43,000
I'm not pushing up too far.

3371
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,360
I don't want to get in trouble here.

3372
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:45,479
There's an enemy in middle lane.

3373
03:27:45,479 --> 03:27:46,360
Enemy in mid.

3374
03:27:46,360 --> 03:27:47,159
Enemy in mid lane.

3375
03:27:47,159 --> 03:27:47,959
Gank incoming.

3376
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:54,899
Wait, people can see my map.

3377
03:27:55,299 --> 03:27:56,719
Oh shit.

3378
03:27:57,440 --> 03:28:01,540
What do I do about this?

3379
03:28:01,540 --> 03:28:13,219
What do I do about this?

3380
03:28:13,219 --> 03:28:14,180
Okay, that's better, right?

3381
03:28:18,229 --> 03:28:19,510
Okay, now I understand.

3382
03:28:19,510 --> 03:28:20,469
There we go.

3383
03:28:20,469 --> 03:28:21,649
Enemy missing middle.

3384
03:28:21,649 --> 03:28:22,450
Enemy missing middle.

3385
03:28:22,450 --> 03:28:23,250
Enemy missing middle.

3386
03:28:23,809 --> 03:28:26,100
Enemy missing middle.

3387
03:28:26,100 --> 03:28:30,799
Can I help you?

3388
03:28:38,069 --> 03:28:38,870
Gank left lane.

3389
03:28:38,870 --> 03:28:39,829
Gank left lane.

3390
03:28:39,829 --> 03:28:40,149
Get him.

3391
03:28:43,670 --> 03:28:44,469
I missed everything.

3392
03:28:45,190 --> 03:28:47,250
I have no mana.

3393
03:28:47,250 --> 03:28:48,370
Oh shit, I don't have any mana.

3394
03:28:52,180 --> 03:28:53,940
I don't think I can do this by streaming this.

3395
03:28:54,579 --> 03:28:58,790
This is too much pressure.

3396
03:28:58,790 --> 03:28:59,590
I don't like this.

3397
03:29:01,030 --> 03:29:03,430
Okay, you want to know the last time I played Conquest?

3398
03:29:03,430 --> 03:29:06,239
2017.

3399
03:29:06,239 --> 03:29:07,840
Or probably 2016.

3400
03:29:07,840 --> 03:29:20,319
I've only played Arena and Assault since like 2017.

3401
03:29:20,319 --> 03:29:22,000
I don't, this is too much pressure.

3402
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:22,879
It's too much.

3403
03:29:22,879 --> 03:29:27,379
A fake map up there?

3404
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:30,579
I probably shouldn't have played Khronos either.

3405
03:29:30,579 --> 03:29:33,139
Oh man, I'm trying to like look good for this stream.

3406
03:29:33,860 --> 03:29:35,059
Yeah, I'm gonna play Khronos.

3407
03:29:35,059 --> 03:29:38,020
Like he's got like a complicated kind of number two move.

3408
03:29:38,020 --> 03:29:39,299
Well, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

3409
03:29:40,020 --> 03:29:49,170
Okay, enemy has returned middle.

3410
03:29:49,170 --> 03:29:58,979
I'm afraid to go any further than this.

3411
03:29:58,979 --> 03:30:07,379
Well, they all know.

3412
03:30:08,850 --> 03:30:11,090
This was never gonna work out the way that I thought, right?

3413
03:30:11,889 --> 03:30:21,620
It's all right.

3414
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:24,500
Hey, if we win, look, they have such an advantage.

3415
03:30:30,579 --> 03:30:31,299
They're all here.

3416
03:30:40,340 --> 03:30:42,440
Hopefully you can get out.

3417
03:30:42,440 --> 03:30:46,370
All right, I gotta go back.

3418
03:30:46,370 --> 03:30:48,370
Just cover your whole screen.

3419
03:30:49,010 --> 03:30:52,000
We're not playing Conquest again.

3420
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:54,639
Okay, didn't I say earlier?

3421
03:30:54,639 --> 03:30:55,959
I did.

3422
03:30:55,959 --> 03:30:59,239
I said earlier that I am not going to play Conquest

3423
03:30:59,239 --> 03:31:01,299
unless it's a comedy game.

3424
03:31:01,459 --> 03:31:02,579
What am I doing?

3425
03:31:02,579 --> 03:31:03,540
Why are we doing this?

3426
03:31:03,540 --> 03:31:06,180
Honestly, God, what am I doing?

3427
03:31:06,180 --> 03:31:13,540
I just have to try not to die.

3428
03:31:13,540 --> 03:31:14,739
Enemy missing middle.

3429
03:31:14,739 --> 03:31:24,260
Enemy still missing middle.

3430
03:31:24,260 --> 03:31:42,600
All right, I need to level up.

3431
03:31:42,600 --> 03:31:43,319
See, they know.

3432
03:31:43,319 --> 03:31:43,879
They know.

3433
03:31:43,879 --> 03:31:45,569
I can't gank anybody.

3434
03:31:45,569 --> 03:31:46,450
Enemy missing middle.

3435
03:31:46,450 --> 03:31:55,190
Covering the map only helps.

3436
03:31:55,190 --> 03:31:55,989
God damn it.

3437
03:31:56,549 --> 03:32:09,479
Oh, thank you.

3438
03:32:09,479 --> 03:32:16,000
Yeah, we're gonna play arena and assault only.

3439
03:32:16,559 --> 03:32:24,420
Enemy missing middle still.

3440
03:32:25,059 --> 03:32:27,250
I have no idea where the hell they are.

3441
03:32:27,250 --> 03:32:31,879
Oh, they're back.

3442
03:32:31,879 --> 03:32:37,600
Enemy missing left.

3443
03:32:37,600 --> 03:32:38,719
Enemy missing left.

3444
03:32:38,719 --> 03:32:54,069
Enemy missing.

3445
03:32:54,069 --> 03:32:54,870
I found them.

3446
03:32:55,989 --> 03:32:56,790
I found their hair.

3447
03:33:05,940 --> 03:33:08,340
All right, they're coming to the end of the road.

3448
03:33:08,340 --> 03:33:23,989
Just look at my game, you'll know.

3449
03:33:23,989 --> 03:33:24,549
Okay.

3450
03:33:24,549 --> 03:33:30,440
I think everyone's rotating to the left side.

3451
03:33:30,440 --> 03:33:32,159
Team fight incoming.

3452
03:33:32,159 --> 03:33:35,430
It's time to do a team fight.

3453
03:33:35,430 --> 03:33:36,389
Never mind.

3454
03:33:36,389 --> 03:33:38,000
Everybody run away.

3455
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:38,959
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3456
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:40,079
Stay there, stay there, stay there, stay there.

3457
03:33:40,079 --> 03:33:40,639
Check this shit out.

3458
03:33:40,639 --> 03:33:41,680
I'm gonna clean it up.

3459
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:47,959
Did I get killed?

3460
03:33:47,959 --> 03:33:51,920
That's our tower.

3461
03:33:51,920 --> 03:33:53,059
What am I doing?

3462
03:33:53,059 --> 03:33:53,780
Enemy missing middle.

3463
03:34:00,149 --> 03:34:00,709
I missed.

3464
03:34:00,709 --> 03:34:01,270
Whatever.

3465
03:34:01,270 --> 03:34:04,360
Enemy has returned middle.

3466
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:16,879
Enemy missed.

3467
03:34:16,879 --> 03:34:28,340
No, they're here.

3468
03:34:28,340 --> 03:34:28,840
Ooh.

3469
03:34:31,989 --> 03:34:33,270
I need to go back and buy.

3470
03:34:33,270 --> 03:34:47,680
I'm so afraid to move forward.

3471
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:48,180
All right.

3472
03:34:48,799 --> 03:34:49,440
Careful.

3473
03:34:49,440 --> 03:34:52,420
I have to go back.

3474
03:34:52,420 --> 03:34:53,750
I have to go back.

3475
03:34:53,750 --> 03:34:56,260
Be careful.

3476
03:34:56,260 --> 03:34:58,020
Mid is making a...

3477
03:34:58,020 --> 03:34:58,659
What are you doing?

3478
03:34:59,620 --> 03:35:09,729
Oh, I...

3479
03:35:09,729 --> 03:35:10,290
Sorry.

3480
03:35:10,290 --> 03:35:21,409
He thinks he's funny.

3481
03:35:24,739 --> 03:35:28,260
I'm not trying to be funny right now.

3482
03:35:28,260 --> 03:35:31,540
I'm trying not to embarrass myself and die like nine times.

3483
03:35:31,540 --> 03:35:40,100
Enemy is missing middle.

3484
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:49,350
I have no idea where they are.

3485
03:35:49,350 --> 03:35:49,989
Hey, whoa.

3486
03:35:51,110 --> 03:36:01,620
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

3487
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:02,819
They were just waiting for me.

3488
03:36:02,819 --> 03:36:11,190
They're streaming Smite in 2021.

3489
03:36:11,190 --> 03:36:12,959
You're already embarrassing.

3490
03:36:12,959 --> 03:36:13,600
Get out of here.

3491
03:36:20,500 --> 03:36:21,379
Nine times?

3492
03:36:21,379 --> 03:36:21,620
No.

3493
03:36:22,260 --> 03:36:23,780
I'm not gonna die more than six times.

3494
03:36:25,319 --> 03:36:26,600
Can I even buy anything?

3495
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:27,760
I'm just gonna buy this.

3496
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:39,760
Whatever it is.

3497
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:40,479
Okay.

3498
03:36:40,479 --> 03:36:47,350
Enemy is attacking the middle tower and I'm gonna show them to respect me.

3499
03:36:47,909 --> 03:36:55,959
See?

3500
03:36:59,059 --> 03:36:59,379
Yeah.

3501
03:36:59,379 --> 03:37:00,020
Oh, yeah.

3502
03:37:00,020 --> 03:37:00,739
Everybody.

3503
03:37:00,739 --> 03:37:01,780
Here comes Jeremy.

3504
03:37:01,780 --> 03:37:03,059
Oh, everybody move in.

3505
03:37:03,059 --> 03:37:03,940
The infield moves in.

3506
03:37:03,940 --> 03:37:04,979
The outfield moves in.

3507
03:37:04,979 --> 03:37:05,540
Oh, yeah.

3508
03:37:05,540 --> 03:37:07,059
He can't hit past our heads.

3509
03:37:07,620 --> 03:37:08,100
No.

3510
03:37:08,100 --> 03:37:08,739
No way.

3511
03:37:08,739 --> 03:37:09,219
Just keep...

3512
03:37:09,219 --> 03:37:10,020
Yeah.

3513
03:37:10,020 --> 03:37:11,139
Everybody move the fuck in.

3514
03:37:11,780 --> 03:37:15,360
This is when I do a little blooper over the left fielder's head

3515
03:37:15,360 --> 03:37:17,360
because he's playing where the fucking shortstop would be.

3516
03:37:18,079 --> 03:37:20,200
There it goes.

3517
03:37:20,360 --> 03:37:21,159
There it goes.

3518
03:37:22,469 --> 03:37:24,149
And I'm gonna get an inside the park home run.

3519
03:37:24,950 --> 03:37:30,760
I'm scared of that.

3520
03:37:36,049 --> 03:37:36,770
Watch it.

3521
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:37,569
This is bad news.

3522
03:37:39,270 --> 03:37:39,989
Yeah, this is bad news.

3523
03:37:40,790 --> 03:37:41,430
This is bad.

3524
03:37:41,430 --> 03:37:41,909
Bad news.

3525
03:37:43,840 --> 03:37:44,559
Why did I just do that?

3526
03:37:44,559 --> 03:37:45,040
I was supposed to...

3527
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:55,719
All right.

3528
03:37:55,719 --> 03:37:56,360
I'm fine.

3529
03:37:56,360 --> 03:38:01,440
It's too much pressure to play this game.

3530
03:38:01,440 --> 03:38:02,479
I'm not playing this ever again.

3531
03:38:05,110 --> 03:38:06,149
Arena Assault or Fun?

3532
03:38:06,149 --> 03:38:07,030
I'm not doing this again.

3533
03:38:21,520 --> 03:38:28,530
End of Smite Thursdays?

3534
03:38:28,530 --> 03:38:32,200
Well, like all MOBAs, this is important too.

3535
03:38:32,200 --> 03:38:34,360
There was an ever-ticking-down bar

3536
03:38:34,920 --> 03:38:37,409
that is hovering over your head when you play a MOBA.

3537
03:38:38,559 --> 03:38:41,600
If you do not play, the bar continues to tick down.

3538
03:38:42,799 --> 03:38:49,479
Every day you play, you are keeping the bar just barely not moving at all

3539
03:38:49,479 --> 03:38:51,799
and maybe gaining a little bit of progress.

3540
03:38:52,440 --> 03:38:55,680
This game requires that...

3541
03:38:55,680 --> 03:38:56,180
Whoa!

3542
03:39:02,149 --> 03:39:05,969
If you don't play this game for a week, the bar goes to zero.

3543
03:39:06,530 --> 03:39:18,340
You dashed into the...

3544
03:39:20,360 --> 03:39:23,079
If you do not play this game for a full week,

3545
03:39:23,079 --> 03:39:26,000
you need to redo the whole thing all over again.

3546
03:39:26,079 --> 03:39:33,399
What does the bar represent?

3547
03:39:33,399 --> 03:39:35,159
Your skill in a MOBA.

3548
03:39:35,159 --> 03:39:46,959
Okay.

3549
03:39:46,959 --> 03:39:49,680
Before I look at chat and walk into walls, let's get back in here.

3550
03:39:49,680 --> 03:39:53,360
All right.

3551
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:54,239
I didn't die nine times.

3552
03:39:54,239 --> 03:39:57,190
I'm fine.

3553
03:39:57,190 --> 03:39:58,389
I think it's a skill issue.

3554
03:39:58,389 --> 03:40:00,549
Get some better game sense, idiot.

3555
03:40:00,549 --> 03:40:07,799
Guys, I couldn't even tell you what all these buffs on the minimap do.

3556
03:40:07,799 --> 03:40:08,840
Get a better game sense.

3557
03:40:09,399 --> 03:40:11,879
Time that guy out for like fucking three days.

3558
03:40:11,879 --> 03:40:18,629
Permanently.

3559
03:40:18,629 --> 03:40:21,889
Ten minutes.

3560
03:40:21,889 --> 03:40:22,370
All right.

3561
03:40:22,370 --> 03:40:39,559
Is there any missing middle?

3562
03:40:39,559 --> 03:40:40,040
Oh, no.

3563
03:40:40,040 --> 03:40:41,159
There's somebody here.

3564
03:40:41,159 --> 03:40:42,520
You wouldn't be doing this if somebody wasn't here.

3565
03:40:44,399 --> 03:40:45,360
Holy shit.

3566
03:40:45,360 --> 03:40:46,559
I just instantly died.

3567
03:40:46,559 --> 03:40:47,059
Fuck.

3568
03:40:51,649 --> 03:40:52,690
I'm just feeding.

3569
03:40:53,780 --> 03:40:57,459
You can't play Conquest unless you play Conquest every single day.

3570
03:40:57,459 --> 03:40:58,100
That's a fact.

3571
03:40:58,979 --> 03:41:03,059
Like, if you are not playing Conquest, don't play Conquest.

3572
03:41:15,959 --> 03:41:16,360
Uh-oh.

3573
03:41:16,360 --> 03:41:17,319
Little brother down.

3574
03:41:17,319 --> 03:41:18,360
Little brother down.

3575
03:41:18,360 --> 03:41:18,680
Get...

3576
03:41:18,680 --> 03:41:19,159
We need help.

3577
03:41:19,159 --> 03:41:20,200
Little brother down.

3578
03:41:20,200 --> 03:41:26,280
And actually, I'm going to defend myself here.

3579
03:41:26,280 --> 03:41:29,239
We're playing with people in the game that have like 500 games

3580
03:41:29,239 --> 03:41:30,920
played on the gods they're playing right now.

3581
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:34,159
They're like all exes.

3582
03:41:34,159 --> 03:41:35,440
I'm little brother Andy.

3583
03:41:35,440 --> 03:41:36,719
I can't compete with this shit.

3584
03:41:37,360 --> 03:41:52,819
Don't let him steal it.

3585
03:41:52,819 --> 03:41:53,940
Don't let him steal it.

3586
03:41:53,940 --> 03:42:04,739
Don't go too far.

3587
03:42:04,739 --> 03:42:05,700
Don't go too far.

3588
03:42:20,100 --> 03:42:23,299
Where's a time machine where I can like not queue up for Conquest?

3589
03:42:24,180 --> 03:42:34,739
If I had three wishes, one of them would be to not play Conquest tonight.

3590
03:42:35,379 --> 03:42:39,270
The genie comes out of the fucking container.

3591
03:42:39,829 --> 03:42:41,860
What are your three wishes?

3592
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:42,659
You have three.

3593
03:42:42,659 --> 03:42:43,780
What are they?

3594
03:42:43,780 --> 03:42:45,379
I don't want to...

3595
03:42:45,379 --> 03:42:46,819
Make it so I didn't play Conquest.

3596
03:42:46,819 --> 03:42:47,940
We just kept playing assault.

3597
03:42:48,819 --> 03:42:49,620
You sure?

3598
03:42:49,620 --> 03:42:50,120
Yes.

3599
03:42:51,520 --> 03:42:54,000
You seem a little shaky and a little pissed off and nervous.

3600
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:56,559
You don't want to take five minutes to like cool down and...

3601
03:42:56,559 --> 03:42:57,040
No.

3602
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:57,760
No, do it now.

3603
03:43:04,899 --> 03:43:05,399
Okay.

3604
03:43:13,719 --> 03:43:15,639
This guy keeps feeding my games.

3605
03:43:22,530 --> 03:43:26,370
We're gonna be here for like another 40 minutes and I'm gonna die like 30 fucking times.

3606
03:43:26,370 --> 03:43:32,129
I'm gonna die so many times.

3607
03:43:32,129 --> 03:43:33,090
Just accept...

3608
03:43:33,090 --> 03:43:34,530
Accept it at this point.

3609
03:43:34,530 --> 03:43:37,409
It's gonna be a horrendous embarrassing moment.

3610
03:43:37,409 --> 03:43:45,090
Wait, this is a custom game and I am in complete control?

3611
03:43:46,239 --> 03:43:59,860
Are you serious?

3612
03:43:59,860 --> 03:44:00,420
Yeah.

3613
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:02,899
Only reason why you knew where I was is because you have fucking Game Genie on.

3614
03:44:02,899 --> 03:44:03,459
All right.

3615
03:44:03,459 --> 03:44:04,979
They got Game Genie.

3616
03:44:04,979 --> 03:44:06,100
They're just literally watching.

3617
03:44:06,100 --> 03:44:07,139
They have Game Genie stream.

3618
03:44:07,139 --> 03:44:07,540
All right.

3619
03:44:07,540 --> 03:44:12,659
I'm gonna delete it.

3620
03:44:12,659 --> 03:44:13,780
No one's gonna hit F7.

3621
03:44:14,420 --> 03:44:17,559
You know how hard it is to get into a game right now?

3622
03:44:18,280 --> 03:44:19,909
Think about it.

3623
03:44:20,629 --> 03:44:22,930
There's like 10,000 people here.

3624
03:44:23,649 --> 03:44:26,450
If you get into a game on this stream,

3625
03:44:27,329 --> 03:44:29,479
you're not gonna want to hit the surrender button.

3626
03:44:29,479 --> 03:44:31,000
You're gonna want to play this out.

3627
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:42,760
Let's see if I can pull this back.

3628
03:44:42,760 --> 03:44:47,680
Let me pull this back.

3629
03:44:47,680 --> 03:44:50,680
We're not doing very well.

3630
03:44:56,149 --> 03:44:57,270
Just mess with the settings.

3631
03:44:58,280 --> 03:44:59,239
I don't think I can do that.

3632
03:45:11,969 --> 03:45:14,610
They can just see everything we're doing.

3633
03:45:26,239 --> 03:45:35,110
She had the thanks for the 10 community subs.

3634
03:45:35,110 --> 03:45:35,510
Watch out.

3635
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:36,469
We're gonna get collapsed on.

3636
03:45:37,030 --> 03:45:48,309
It seems like an airplane.

3637
03:45:59,829 --> 03:46:00,469
Oh, shit.

3638
03:46:00,469 --> 03:46:01,030
This is bad.

3639
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:03,479
Oh, God.

3640
03:46:12,950 --> 03:46:13,829
Oh, my God.

3641
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:19,940
Okay.

3642
03:46:19,940 --> 03:46:20,579
Everything's all right.

3643
03:46:28,049 --> 03:46:28,530
Kill them?

3644
03:46:28,530 --> 03:46:28,930
I can't.

3645
03:46:28,930 --> 03:46:31,250
I'm Kronos with like two items.

3646
03:46:31,809 --> 03:46:54,360
Click on their head.

3647
03:46:54,920 --> 03:47:01,670
Who's the best cookie in Cookie Run?

3648
03:47:02,229 --> 03:47:02,549
I don't know.

3649
03:47:02,549 --> 03:47:03,670
They all do the same fucking thing.

3650
03:47:19,520 --> 03:47:21,920
We have one and eight, two and five, zero and eight, one and seven.

3651
03:47:21,920 --> 03:47:23,840
But it's all my fault though because I'm bad.

3652
03:47:23,840 --> 03:47:25,360
I'm like, it's my fault.

3653
03:47:31,329 --> 03:47:32,450
You had somebody in mid.

3654
03:47:33,760 --> 03:47:36,079
Amaze will be playing with their eyes closed.

3655
03:47:36,079 --> 03:47:55,030
Remember for God, why he stopped playing this?

3656
03:47:55,030 --> 03:47:55,510
No, no.

3657
03:47:55,510 --> 03:47:59,030
I just told you I have to play like 100 games of this.

3658
03:47:59,670 --> 03:48:05,409
You don't just open up Smite after four years and play Conquest

3659
03:48:05,409 --> 03:48:07,969
with a bunch of fucking level 10 legendary players.

3660
03:48:19,799 --> 03:48:21,079
You are right now.

3661
03:48:21,079 --> 03:48:21,239
Yeah.

3662
03:48:21,239 --> 03:48:23,159
And I'm telling you that it's not.

3663
03:48:23,159 --> 03:48:24,360
It's probably a bad idea.

3664
03:48:38,209 --> 03:48:38,530
What?

3665
03:48:38,530 --> 03:48:39,250
Did we swear?

3666
03:48:52,180 --> 03:48:53,620
Just let them take it.

3667
03:48:53,620 --> 03:48:54,260
Let them win.

3668
03:48:57,430 --> 03:48:57,989
Let them win.

3669
03:48:58,709 --> 03:48:59,670
It's not gonna happen.

3670
03:48:59,670 --> 03:49:01,190
Let them dive the fucking fountain on me.

3671
03:49:01,270 --> 03:49:01,989
I know they want to.

3672
03:49:12,719 --> 03:49:14,920
No, that was not.

3673
03:49:14,920 --> 03:49:15,559
That was 10.

3674
03:49:16,760 --> 03:49:17,639
Oh my goodness.

3675
03:49:33,750 --> 03:49:41,110
This Bologna is like, is just carrying our whole team.

3676
03:49:41,110 --> 03:49:41,350
Okay.

3677
03:49:41,350 --> 03:49:42,469
That was a Conquest.

3678
03:49:42,469 --> 03:49:44,549
We're literally never doing that ever again.

3679
03:49:46,549 --> 03:49:49,350
You will never see that on this stream ever again.

3680
03:49:49,350 --> 03:49:50,870
Ever.

3681
03:49:50,870 --> 03:49:51,909
Not in 100 years.

3682
03:49:51,909 --> 03:49:54,129
So let's go back to Assault.

3683
03:49:54,129 --> 03:49:54,610
That was fun.

3684
03:50:03,059 --> 03:50:07,860
100 years will have to go by before I do that ever again.

3685
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:27,729
Yeah.

3686
03:50:27,729 --> 03:50:28,850
I can get rid of the minimap now.

3687
03:50:28,850 --> 03:50:32,680
Yeah.

3688
03:50:32,680 --> 03:50:33,399
One in 10.

3689
03:50:33,399 --> 03:50:34,040
One in 10.

3690
03:50:34,600 --> 03:50:35,000
Yeah.

3691
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:36,840
I'm not even gonna have that.

3692
03:50:36,840 --> 03:50:38,200
I'm not even gonna give a response to that.

3693
03:50:39,059 --> 03:50:40,500
I'm not gonna even give a response.

3694
03:50:41,059 --> 03:50:42,280
But let me tell you.

3695
03:50:42,840 --> 03:50:53,090
Whoever gets this password, seriously, I have no idea how you would know this.

3696
03:51:01,409 --> 03:51:02,530
Thanks for playing though.

3697
03:51:02,530 --> 03:51:06,129
That was the worst gamer moment.

3698
03:51:06,129 --> 03:51:07,010
That's not fair.

3699
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:08,290
It's a team game.

3700
03:51:08,290 --> 03:51:10,370
If that was a 1v1, then sure.

3701
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:20,659
But that's a team game.

3702
03:51:20,659 --> 03:51:21,219
Oh shit.

3703
03:51:21,219 --> 03:51:22,500
I don't even know what the password is.

3704
03:51:22,500 --> 03:51:25,280
I already forgot it.

3705
03:51:26,850 --> 03:51:27,329
What was it?

3706
03:51:29,409 --> 03:51:29,649
Okay.

3707
03:51:29,649 --> 03:51:30,450
I remember.

3708
03:51:30,450 --> 03:51:31,889
All right.

3709
03:51:31,889 --> 03:51:33,090
So the password, I'll give you one hint.

3710
03:51:33,090 --> 03:51:33,809
It's an animal.

3711
03:51:33,809 --> 03:51:35,489
That has to do with an animal.

3712
03:51:45,010 --> 03:51:46,370
Some would say my favorite animal.

3713
03:51:46,930 --> 03:51:51,670
I would take a guess.

3714
03:51:52,309 --> 03:52:00,120
And it's how I feel about this particular animal.

3715
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:15,649
That's what I think about them.

3716
03:52:15,649 --> 03:52:16,930
Still stumped, I think.

3717
03:52:16,930 --> 03:52:29,510
It starts with the animal's name.

3718
03:52:29,510 --> 03:52:32,469
And they are something.

3719
03:52:32,469 --> 03:52:40,520
They are something, aren't they?

3720
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:50,000
Nice job.

3721
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:51,510
Nice job.

3722
03:52:51,510 --> 03:52:51,989
All right.

3723
03:52:51,989 --> 03:52:52,790
They're getting it.

3724
03:52:52,790 --> 03:53:02,979
I wonder what you're gonna...

3725
03:53:02,979 --> 03:53:06,629
Well, you can't play Cabrac and it's assault.

3726
03:53:06,629 --> 03:53:10,309
The password is frogsareawesome with no capitals and no spaces.

3727
03:53:10,309 --> 03:53:18,760
How long have I been streaming for?

3728
03:53:21,649 --> 03:53:22,049
Really?

3729
03:53:22,049 --> 03:53:22,610
Four hours?

3730
03:53:24,950 --> 03:53:25,750
Oh no.

3731
03:53:25,750 --> 03:53:27,030
Somebody switch with me, please.

3732
03:53:27,030 --> 03:53:28,500
I don't know how to play...

3733
03:53:28,500 --> 03:53:30,979
I don't know how to play any of the characters that are on the screen.

3734
03:53:30,979 --> 03:53:33,879
I don't know how to play Achilles.

3735
03:53:34,520 --> 03:53:34,920
But sure.

3736
03:53:34,920 --> 03:53:35,799
Achilles.

3737
03:53:35,799 --> 03:53:36,760
Does anyone else want to switch?

3738
03:53:37,479 --> 03:53:38,979
Okay.

3739
03:53:46,600 --> 03:53:48,040
I don't want to play as that guy.

3740
03:53:50,530 --> 03:53:51,489
Stop.

3741
03:53:51,489 --> 03:53:59,920
I don't know how to play that character.

3742
03:53:59,920 --> 03:54:00,639
No.

3743
03:54:00,639 --> 03:54:04,530
I have to play with the character.

3744
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:05,969
At least I know what their moves do.

3745
03:54:05,969 --> 03:54:20,420
You get a heal with blue orbs.

3746
03:54:20,420 --> 03:54:22,659
Yeah, I think I figured that out pretty late last time.

3747
03:54:22,659 --> 03:54:30,340
I can't tell you how internally happy I am

3748
03:54:30,340 --> 03:54:31,940
that we're not in that Conquest game anymore.

3749
03:54:32,500 --> 03:54:34,530
Nothing against the players that were there.

3750
03:54:34,530 --> 03:54:36,290
Like, I'm sure it was a lot of fun for you guys.

3751
03:54:36,290 --> 03:54:38,129
It was pretty cool to play.

3752
03:54:38,129 --> 03:54:40,229
Well, man, I'm so glad I'm not in that game anymore.

3753
03:54:40,229 --> 03:54:43,440
I'm so happy to be in assault again.

3754
03:54:59,620 --> 03:55:01,620
Salty gamer makes windows noise.

3755
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:02,659
No, I'm not even salty.

3756
03:55:02,659 --> 03:55:05,139
I'm just embarrassed and sad.

3757
03:55:05,139 --> 03:55:08,790
I'm not.

3758
03:55:08,790 --> 03:55:09,270
I'm kidding.

3759
03:55:09,270 --> 03:55:10,069
I'm fine.

3760
03:55:10,069 --> 03:55:12,360
It's a game of Smite.

3761
03:55:12,360 --> 03:55:13,569
Oh, I'm just...

3762
03:55:14,370 --> 03:55:16,690
I'm just so sad about that and embarrassed.

3763
03:55:16,690 --> 03:55:17,329
It's a game of...

3764
03:55:17,329 --> 03:55:18,690
It's a game of Smite.

3765
03:55:18,690 --> 03:55:19,250
Relax.

3766
03:55:19,250 --> 03:55:20,209
It's gonna be fine, Jeremy.

3767
03:55:20,930 --> 03:55:21,430
Who cares?

3768
03:55:22,290 --> 03:55:23,840
It's fine.

3769
03:55:23,840 --> 03:55:24,239
Let's go.

3770
03:55:26,000 --> 03:55:33,440
These are expensive, but I want it.

3771
03:55:33,440 --> 03:55:39,010
Can I just get five of them?

3772
03:55:39,010 --> 03:55:40,000
And mana?

3773
03:55:44,399 --> 03:55:45,270
Here, let's go.

3774
03:55:47,969 --> 03:55:48,930
Is he actually mad?

3775
03:55:51,639 --> 03:55:52,520
Yeah, I actually am.

3776
03:55:53,079 --> 03:55:55,590
I'm very mad.

3777
03:55:55,590 --> 03:55:59,329
Jeremy, I got a little bit of milkshake left.

3778
03:55:59,329 --> 03:56:00,209
Do you want it?

3779
03:56:00,209 --> 03:56:01,090
That's what I'm talking about.

3780
03:56:01,649 --> 03:56:02,950
It's exactly the kind of shit I'm talking about.

3781
03:56:02,950 --> 03:56:04,790
I can't have a sip of that milkshake.

3782
03:56:04,790 --> 03:56:05,989
I don't know who the fuck you are.

3783
03:56:05,989 --> 03:56:06,629
I don't know where you are.

3784
03:56:06,629 --> 03:56:07,270
I don't know who you are.

3785
03:56:07,909 --> 03:56:09,959
And now I have to think about having a milkshake

3786
03:56:09,959 --> 03:56:11,000
and how delicious that would be.

3787
03:56:11,000 --> 03:56:12,200
And now I'm pissed off now.

3788
03:56:13,639 --> 03:56:15,079
God, it's so hard to be me.

3789
03:56:16,440 --> 03:56:19,479
God, I'm so fucking annoyed right now.

3790
03:56:29,190 --> 03:56:30,579
All right, let's go.

3791
03:56:30,579 --> 03:56:31,379
It's time for fun.

3792
03:56:31,940 --> 03:56:36,979
I freaked him out.

3793
03:56:36,979 --> 03:56:37,780
I freaked him out wicked bad.

3794
03:56:56,319 --> 03:56:57,520
Did we not kill anybody?

3795
03:56:57,520 --> 03:56:58,159
We did, right?

3796
03:56:59,479 --> 03:57:00,280
No, we didn't.

3797
03:57:11,760 --> 03:57:14,959
I thought that that was going to really just jostle everybody.

3798
03:57:23,110 --> 03:57:26,420
I think we're okay.

3799
03:57:27,059 --> 03:57:28,340
All right, let's go.

3800
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:28,659
Quiet.

3801
03:57:29,620 --> 03:57:30,340
I'm going to place my...

3802
03:57:31,139 --> 03:57:48,610
Oh, somebody else get that.

3803
03:57:48,610 --> 03:57:49,409
I don't need it.

3804
03:57:49,409 --> 03:57:50,129
I shouldn't just get it.

3805
03:58:04,629 --> 03:58:05,110
Geez.

3806
03:58:08,079 --> 03:58:08,399
Geez.

3807
03:58:09,280 --> 03:58:09,920
Oh, geez.

3808
03:58:11,319 --> 03:58:12,040
Oh, geez.

3809
03:58:12,600 --> 03:58:25,969
Oh, geez.

3810
03:58:25,969 --> 03:58:26,610
They're going to get it.

3811
03:58:34,469 --> 03:58:35,270
Really?

3812
03:58:35,270 --> 03:58:37,670
That was so close.

3813
03:58:37,670 --> 03:58:38,469
That was dead.

3814
03:58:56,899 --> 03:58:57,620
Oh, fuck.

3815
03:58:58,180 --> 03:59:00,069
Backflip, please.

3816
03:59:05,239 --> 03:59:05,959
Who's doing that?

3817
03:59:05,959 --> 03:59:07,239
What character is that?

3818
03:59:07,239 --> 03:59:10,000
Is that Knox's move?

3819
03:59:10,719 --> 03:59:13,540
Who has that move?

3820
03:59:22,879 --> 03:59:32,129
What do I need to drink every time Jerma dies?

3821
03:59:34,129 --> 03:59:34,690
Don't do that.

3822
03:59:35,409 --> 03:59:37,559
I'm very, very concerned about your health.

3823
03:59:50,790 --> 03:59:51,190
Block it.

3824
04:00:00,639 --> 04:00:01,520
Nice.

3825
04:00:01,520 --> 04:00:02,079
Very nice.

3826
04:00:09,479 --> 04:00:11,479
That's exactly what we needed to have happen.

3827
04:00:11,479 --> 04:00:12,120
Good job.

3828
04:00:12,120 --> 04:00:13,799
That was the Achilles in the Gilgamesh.

3829
04:00:13,799 --> 04:00:16,280
Nice job.

3830
04:00:16,280 --> 04:00:17,719
I'm not even looking at the screen.

3831
04:00:17,719 --> 04:00:18,280
Oh, my God.

3832
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:19,079
Please don't kill me.

3833
04:00:23,079 --> 04:00:24,680
I wasn't even looking.

3834
04:00:24,680 --> 04:00:25,959
I was looking at chat.

3835
04:00:35,270 --> 04:00:37,350
I did not realize that it was on me.

3836
04:00:37,350 --> 04:00:39,270
I thought that we had a bunch of minions in there.

3837
04:00:39,829 --> 04:00:41,510
Oh, Jesus.

3838
04:00:42,079 --> 04:00:42,319
Okay.

3839
04:00:58,200 --> 04:01:03,120
This game looks like it would be in a movie about video games

3840
04:01:03,120 --> 04:01:05,760
made by people who will never have played video games.

3841
04:01:06,659 --> 04:01:08,180
Like, but this is the thing that's on the screen

3842
04:01:08,180 --> 04:01:09,780
that's like the generic video game.

3843
04:01:13,809 --> 04:01:15,170
I think this game actually looks pretty good.

3844
04:01:15,969 --> 04:01:18,079
I think it's actually like a really nice looking game.

3845
04:01:18,639 --> 04:01:25,430
Oh, that's not good.

3846
04:01:25,430 --> 04:01:41,399
What was that?

3847
04:01:44,639 --> 04:01:54,149
Oh, get him.

3848
04:01:54,950 --> 04:01:55,350
What?

3849
04:01:55,350 --> 04:01:56,069
Oh, come on.

3850
04:02:01,889 --> 04:02:02,450
This is so...

3851
04:02:03,090 --> 04:02:04,450
We're getting stomped right now.

3852
04:02:07,090 --> 04:02:07,489
No, we're not.

3853
04:02:11,969 --> 04:02:12,610
How did I miss it?

3854
04:02:13,940 --> 04:02:14,340
Almost.

3855
04:02:14,979 --> 04:02:22,200
Get away from me.

3856
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:22,600
Jesus.

3857
04:02:23,159 --> 04:02:28,959
Yeah, that's right.

3858
04:02:28,959 --> 04:02:29,840
All the people can walk into it.

3859
04:02:29,840 --> 04:02:30,239
That's right.

3860
04:02:30,799 --> 04:02:47,350
What is that?

3861
04:02:47,989 --> 04:02:56,959
Does this game have twitchy modes?

3862
04:02:56,959 --> 04:02:58,319
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

3863
04:02:58,319 --> 04:03:00,159
I think it's some kind of skin or something.

3864
04:03:05,700 --> 04:03:06,340
Oh, fuck.

3865
04:03:06,340 --> 04:03:07,059
I'm in trouble here.

3866
04:03:07,860 --> 04:03:09,319
Did I just get picked out of the air?

3867
04:03:11,799 --> 04:03:13,879
Oh, we're getting kind of beat here.

3868
04:03:27,459 --> 04:03:28,180
Oh, and four.

3869
04:03:30,159 --> 04:03:32,639
We're getting collectively beat, okay?

3870
04:03:33,520 --> 04:03:34,799
We're getting collectively beat.

3871
04:03:34,799 --> 04:03:36,000
I don't want to hear oh, and four.

3872
04:03:36,000 --> 04:03:38,799
I want to hear collectively beat Omega Low.

3873
04:03:38,799 --> 04:03:41,200
Collectively beat Omega Low, okay?

3874
04:03:59,879 --> 04:04:01,559
There we go.

3875
04:04:01,559 --> 04:04:01,879
All right.

3876
04:04:04,500 --> 04:04:06,959
We don't have a tower anymore.

3877
04:04:06,959 --> 04:04:07,520
That's right.

3878
04:04:07,520 --> 04:04:18,639
Everyone, have you ever hit an auto attack?

3879
04:04:20,659 --> 04:04:21,379
This game?

3880
04:04:21,379 --> 04:04:21,620
Yeah.

3881
04:04:27,079 --> 04:04:27,319
Lag.

3882
04:04:27,879 --> 04:04:29,540
That's why this is happening.

3883
04:04:30,579 --> 04:04:31,219
Just lagged out.

3884
04:04:31,940 --> 04:04:49,809
Get that balona.

3885
04:05:23,170 --> 04:05:23,489
Kill.

3886
04:05:24,290 --> 04:05:27,649
Move.

3887
04:05:28,530 --> 04:05:28,930
We got it.

3888
04:05:29,889 --> 04:05:30,850
I didn't get any of those.

3889
04:05:31,409 --> 04:05:32,370
I thought I got one.

3890
04:05:33,090 --> 04:05:35,889
Don't let this thing kill me, please.

3891
04:05:35,889 --> 04:05:37,170
That's another embarrassing moment.

3892
04:05:37,729 --> 04:05:40,850
Is it hitting me?

3893
04:05:41,409 --> 04:05:42,209
I'm so concerned.

3894
04:06:04,180 --> 04:06:05,059
We go?

3895
04:06:05,059 --> 04:06:05,840
Holy shit.

3896
04:06:05,840 --> 04:06:07,200
Are we going to just roll this?

3897
04:06:07,200 --> 04:06:07,600
No way.

3898
04:06:08,159 --> 04:06:08,799
Oh, this is bad.

3899
04:06:09,600 --> 04:06:12,770
Run.

3900
04:06:20,340 --> 04:06:28,520
Nice.

3901
04:06:29,239 --> 04:06:29,479
All right.

3902
04:06:29,479 --> 04:06:30,680
Good work, everybody.

3903
04:06:30,680 --> 04:06:41,760
Get out of here.

3904
04:06:41,760 --> 04:06:44,610
Fenrir on the right.

3905
04:06:44,610 --> 04:06:46,440
Watch that.

3906
04:06:46,440 --> 04:06:47,239
Watch that Fenrir.

3907
04:06:47,799 --> 04:06:49,430
Oh, fuck.

3908
04:06:49,430 --> 04:06:56,040
Fenrir behind us.

3909
04:06:56,600 --> 04:07:00,610
Watch that Fenrir.

3910
04:07:00,610 --> 04:07:01,809
Fenrir is waving at us.

3911
04:07:01,809 --> 04:07:02,209
Watch out.

3912
04:07:02,209 --> 04:07:02,610
Watch out.

3913
04:07:02,610 --> 04:07:03,010
Watch out.

3914
04:07:05,399 --> 04:07:05,959
Oh, no.

3915
04:07:06,680 --> 04:07:19,409
Oh, my God.

3916
04:07:19,409 --> 04:07:20,450
We don't have a tower.

3917
04:07:20,450 --> 04:07:20,770
No way.

3918
04:07:20,770 --> 04:07:21,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3919
04:07:21,889 --> 04:07:22,850
I thought we had a tower.

3920
04:07:22,850 --> 04:07:23,489
Oh, my God.

3921
04:07:23,489 --> 04:07:24,209
I'm so bad.

3922
04:07:24,209 --> 04:07:25,090
It's just I can't play.

3923
04:07:25,809 --> 04:07:27,909
I just can't play.

3924
04:07:27,909 --> 04:07:28,549
You know what I mean?

3925
04:07:28,549 --> 04:07:29,190
Like I just get...

3926
04:07:29,190 --> 04:07:30,469
I'm just in three different places.

3927
04:07:30,469 --> 04:07:32,549
My brain is like in three places.

3928
04:07:32,549 --> 04:07:34,790
It's like I'm looking at chat.

3929
04:07:34,790 --> 04:07:36,069
I'm thinking of the next thing to say.

3930
04:07:36,069 --> 04:07:37,270
And I'm playing Smite.

3931
04:07:37,270 --> 04:07:38,709
All those things have to be zero.

3932
04:07:38,709 --> 04:07:40,229
I have to only use my brain for Smite.

3933
04:07:40,790 --> 04:07:47,969
If we're ever working, don't talk to me.

3934
04:07:47,969 --> 04:07:49,170
If you ever want me to get anything done.

3935
04:07:50,049 --> 04:07:53,110
If you're one of those kind of co-workers

3936
04:07:53,110 --> 04:07:54,389
that would walk up to my desk,

3937
04:07:55,190 --> 04:07:56,770
just leave me alone.

3938
04:07:58,129 --> 04:08:38,420
You're almost an economy car that can only...

3939
04:08:38,420 --> 04:08:40,500
It saves money because it only goes on three cylinders.

3940
04:08:41,139 --> 04:08:42,920
No, I have a...

3941
04:08:42,920 --> 04:08:43,959
My car is awesome.

3942
04:08:44,520 --> 04:08:45,799
I have a really fast car,

3943
04:08:47,879 --> 04:08:51,719
but I can only operate one thing at a time.

3944
04:08:52,600 --> 04:09:03,239
Whoops, wrong button.

3945
04:09:13,780 --> 04:09:14,340
Kill it.

3946
04:09:21,670 --> 04:09:22,149
Kill it.

3947
04:09:22,709 --> 04:09:35,159
Don't let...

3948
04:09:35,159 --> 04:09:35,719
Don't...

3949
04:09:35,719 --> 04:09:36,600
It's not worth it.

3950
04:09:36,600 --> 04:09:43,040
Where's the auto attack guy?

3951
04:09:43,040 --> 04:09:43,600
Because you're right.

3952
04:10:00,469 --> 04:10:01,030
God damn it.

3953
04:10:01,030 --> 04:10:01,670
What was I thinking?

3954
04:10:02,389 --> 04:10:03,110
What was I thinking?

3955
04:10:03,670 --> 04:10:08,899
What was I thinking?

3956
04:10:08,899 --> 04:10:17,829
Why are they running after me still?

3957
04:10:26,950 --> 04:10:29,090
I'm not going in there.

3958
04:10:31,719 --> 04:10:32,120
Wait a minute.

3959
04:10:32,120 --> 04:10:32,440
Should we?

3960
04:10:44,600 --> 04:10:56,020
All right.

3961
04:10:56,020 --> 04:10:56,579
Be careful.

3962
04:10:58,799 --> 04:11:01,969
What's going on?

3963
04:11:08,899 --> 04:11:09,379
All right.

3964
04:11:09,379 --> 04:11:09,940
Okay.

3965
04:11:09,940 --> 04:11:10,340
All right.

3966
04:11:10,340 --> 04:11:10,739
This is it.

3967
04:11:14,950 --> 04:11:15,350
Okay.

3968
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:15,750
All right.

3969
04:11:19,059 --> 04:11:20,260
What the fuck just happened?

3970
04:11:44,440 --> 04:11:45,319
That feeling...

3971
04:11:45,319 --> 04:11:46,760
That face when we could be playing Charlie

3972
04:11:46,760 --> 04:11:48,280
and the Chocolate Factor for PS2

3973
04:11:48,280 --> 04:11:50,200
and we're suffering instead in Smite.

3974
04:11:52,950 --> 04:11:54,709
I mean, my first like five or six...

3975
04:11:55,430 --> 04:11:57,110
I can't hear myself breathing.

3976
04:11:59,010 --> 04:12:00,610
The first like five games were fine.

3977
04:12:00,610 --> 04:12:01,489
I was doing pretty good.

3978
04:12:02,950 --> 04:12:04,149
Did I hit gamer fatigue?

3979
04:12:21,700 --> 04:12:23,459
The first like six games we played,

3980
04:12:23,459 --> 04:12:25,139
I was like 10 and four,

3981
04:12:25,139 --> 04:12:26,500
like 12 and six.

3982
04:12:26,500 --> 04:12:38,100
Is that actually...

3983
04:12:38,100 --> 04:12:39,139
Is that game any fun?

3984
04:12:39,139 --> 04:12:40,819
Should I play Charlie and the Chocolate Factor?

3985
04:12:43,840 --> 04:12:50,309
I do not want to be up here alone.

3986
04:13:03,360 --> 04:13:03,680
I'll go.

3987
04:13:04,879 --> 04:13:07,079
Were you queuing with randoms?

3988
04:13:07,079 --> 04:13:07,719
No, even the random...

3989
04:13:07,719 --> 04:13:08,760
Even the ones when we played with the...

3990
04:13:09,399 --> 04:13:09,959
Viewer games.

3991
04:13:09,959 --> 04:13:10,600
I was doing all right.

3992
04:13:15,479 --> 04:13:16,840
I have to get at least one kill here.

3993
04:13:16,840 --> 04:13:17,719
This is ridiculous.

3994
04:13:17,719 --> 04:13:18,360
Come on.

3995
04:13:18,360 --> 04:13:24,450
I look like the villain from Amnesia.

3996
04:13:35,159 --> 04:13:35,879
Oh shit.

3997
04:13:35,879 --> 04:13:36,120
Move.

3998
04:13:44,079 --> 04:13:44,879
Thanks, I guess.

3999
04:13:55,280 --> 04:13:55,520
All right.

4000
04:13:55,520 --> 04:13:57,040
We have the advantage now.

4001
04:13:57,040 --> 04:14:00,479
I believe we have pretty good advantage.

4002
04:14:00,479 --> 04:14:10,610
I want everyone to remember to keep in mind

4003
04:14:10,610 --> 04:14:11,809
that if you don't think you have any power

4004
04:14:12,370 --> 04:14:13,649
on this channel or in this community...

4005
04:14:17,360 --> 04:14:18,479
Remember, this stream only happened

4006
04:14:18,479 --> 04:14:20,159
because three people in freestream wanted to see it.

4007
04:14:20,879 --> 04:14:21,670
Remember that.

4008
04:14:23,780 --> 04:14:24,979
You don't think that you have power here.

4009
04:14:40,370 --> 04:14:43,299
You remind me of it.

4010
04:14:43,299 --> 04:14:43,940
Destiny 2.

4011
04:14:43,940 --> 04:14:44,979
I'm never going to play Destiny 2.

4012
04:14:44,979 --> 04:14:45,379
Put your feet.

4013
04:14:45,379 --> 04:14:46,180
Get out of here.

4014
04:14:46,180 --> 04:14:48,930
We actually won the game.

4015
04:14:48,930 --> 04:14:49,649
I got one kill.

4016
04:14:49,649 --> 04:14:49,969
All right.

4017
04:14:49,969 --> 04:14:50,290
I'm good.

4018
04:14:50,290 --> 04:14:53,940
Let me show you how it's done.

4019
04:14:53,940 --> 04:15:04,079
Remember, this stream sucks, Rufflecopter.

4020
04:15:04,639 --> 04:15:08,600
How dare you use like a 2007 meme in my channel?

4021
04:15:10,500 --> 04:15:11,780
How dare you?

4022
04:15:12,420 --> 04:15:20,049
All right.

4023
04:15:20,049 --> 04:15:20,930
Let's do another one.

4024
04:15:20,930 --> 04:15:21,479
All right.

4025
04:15:21,479 --> 04:15:23,329
We're going to do a comedy game this time.

4026
04:15:23,329 --> 04:15:24,209
This one's just for fun.

4027
04:16:01,479 --> 04:16:06,280
Password is...

4028
04:16:06,280 --> 04:16:06,760
I don't know.

4029
04:16:06,760 --> 04:16:10,370
I don't remember.

4030
04:16:10,370 --> 04:16:22,159
I actually don't.

4031
04:16:22,159 --> 04:16:26,840
Do a V2 in Conquest.

4032
04:16:26,840 --> 04:16:28,159
Random pick.

4033
04:16:28,159 --> 04:16:29,280
Everybody starts at level 20.

4034
04:16:29,280 --> 04:16:30,239
100,000 gold.

4035
04:16:30,239 --> 04:16:32,549
No pauses.

4036
04:16:32,549 --> 04:16:33,750
Welcome to Japan.

4037
04:16:33,750 --> 04:16:47,940
What's the password?

4038
04:16:47,940 --> 04:16:48,500
Nice.

4039
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:50,399
Password is 1, 2, 3.

4040
04:16:52,360 --> 04:16:52,680
All right.

4041
04:16:52,680 --> 04:16:53,079
Here we go.

4042
04:16:53,079 --> 04:16:57,940
Let's go for it.

4043
04:16:57,940 --> 04:17:00,239
We got to stick together.

4044
04:17:00,239 --> 04:17:01,120
Very important.

4045
04:17:01,120 --> 04:17:09,969
At least we got a Bolano.

4046
04:17:09,969 --> 04:17:12,579
Kamazots?

4047
04:17:13,219 --> 04:17:13,940
He has a swoop.

4048
04:17:13,940 --> 04:17:14,420
I don't know.

4049
04:17:14,420 --> 04:17:14,899
I don't remember.

4050
04:17:14,899 --> 04:17:22,719
What does he do?

4051
04:17:22,719 --> 04:17:45,139
Isn't Kamazots actually like F tier?

4052
04:17:45,139 --> 04:17:46,020
Build lifesteal.

4053
04:17:46,020 --> 04:17:46,420
All right.

4054
04:17:46,420 --> 04:17:48,799
Just buy every lifesteal item.

4055
04:17:48,799 --> 04:17:57,700
I wonder how the ping is going to be.

4056
04:17:57,700 --> 04:18:08,209
All right.

4057
04:18:08,209 --> 04:18:09,409
We got to move quickly.

4058
04:18:09,409 --> 04:18:17,489
Lifesteal.

4059
04:18:22,799 --> 04:18:23,200
Okay.

4060
04:18:23,200 --> 04:18:23,600
I guess.

4061
04:18:27,350 --> 04:18:33,940
I don't know.

4062
04:18:33,940 --> 04:18:34,180
All right.

4063
04:18:34,180 --> 04:18:36,629
I don't know what the character does, but let's go.

4064
04:18:36,629 --> 04:18:36,870
Wait.

4065
04:18:36,870 --> 04:18:37,510
Potions.

4066
04:18:37,510 --> 04:18:42,209
Potions aren't going to do anything, are they?

4067
04:18:42,209 --> 04:18:42,450
Wards.

4068
04:18:42,450 --> 04:18:43,170
We need wards.

4069
04:18:43,170 --> 04:18:48,200
All right.

4070
04:18:48,200 --> 04:18:57,280
Let's go.

4071
04:18:57,280 --> 04:18:57,840
I'm thinking.

4072
04:18:57,840 --> 04:19:02,819
Honestly, I'm thinking we just dive the first tower.

4073
04:19:02,819 --> 04:19:03,540
Just really quickly.

4074
04:19:03,540 --> 04:19:06,180
Just dive the tower.

4075
04:19:06,180 --> 04:19:16,450
There's no way it's going to kill us.

4076
04:19:16,450 --> 04:19:17,170
Oh my god.

4077
04:19:17,170 --> 04:19:20,790
You're Freya.

4078
04:19:20,790 --> 04:19:21,030
All right.

4079
04:19:21,030 --> 04:19:21,909
Get in it, Bolano.

4080
04:19:21,909 --> 04:19:23,270
It caused some havoc.

4081
04:19:23,270 --> 04:19:24,549
It's Freya.

4082
04:19:24,549 --> 04:19:25,030
It's over.

4083
04:19:26,149 --> 04:19:27,190
Freya is so good.

4084
04:19:28,180 --> 04:19:28,899
Oh, man.

4085
04:19:29,459 --> 04:19:43,649
Freya activates her 1, her 2, and then just does the link to the past spam and just kills everybody.

4086
04:19:43,649 --> 04:19:45,250
Sell everything and buy defense.

4087
04:19:45,250 --> 04:19:46,370
I, should I?

4088
04:19:48,079 --> 04:19:49,680
Apollo and Freya late game.

4089
04:19:49,680 --> 04:19:53,090
Oh, it's over.

4090
04:19:53,090 --> 04:19:54,049
But this Bolona.

4091
04:19:54,049 --> 04:19:56,079
I got Bolona.

4092
04:19:56,079 --> 04:19:57,360
I need defense.

4093
04:19:57,360 --> 04:19:57,600
Okay.

4094
04:19:57,600 --> 04:19:58,399
We're going to.

4095
04:19:58,399 --> 04:20:01,110
Physical defense.

4096
04:20:01,750 --> 04:20:07,760
Physical defense.

4097
04:20:09,989 --> 04:20:32,399
Magic defense.

4098
04:20:32,399 --> 04:20:32,959
You good?

4099
04:20:32,959 --> 04:20:33,600
Let's go.

4100
04:20:33,600 --> 04:20:40,440
I ate that ult.

4101
04:20:40,440 --> 04:20:40,760
Let's go.

4102
04:20:50,260 --> 04:20:51,940
Oh, this is bad.

4103
04:20:51,940 --> 04:21:01,649
That's not going to work.

4104
04:21:02,290 --> 04:21:09,889
Power.

4105
04:21:09,889 --> 04:21:10,930
Power, power, power, power, power.

4106
04:21:12,200 --> 04:21:12,600
Power.

4107
04:21:12,600 --> 04:21:13,639
Whatever power is, I don't care.

4108
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:15,700
Lifesteal.

4109
04:21:18,760 --> 04:21:19,959
I don't, I don't know what any of these do.

4110
04:21:19,959 --> 04:21:20,840
Whatever.

4111
04:21:20,840 --> 04:21:22,549
What's that super potion?

4112
04:21:32,979 --> 04:21:33,780
Am I still dead?

4113
04:21:38,159 --> 04:21:45,989
What?

4114
04:21:45,989 --> 04:21:47,190
They could have just won the game.

4115
04:21:47,190 --> 04:21:59,159
How are we going to do this?

4116
04:21:59,159 --> 04:22:05,750
I think we just ignore them and we just pick a lane that they're not in and try to just beat the game before they do.

4117
04:22:05,750 --> 04:22:11,079
You know what I'm saying?

4118
04:22:11,079 --> 04:22:16,469
2v2 on Conquest.

4119
04:22:16,469 --> 04:22:17,030
I don't know the game.

4120
04:22:17,030 --> 04:22:17,989
Something bugged out.

4121
04:22:17,989 --> 04:22:22,709
I queued up with my buddy here and I don't know.

4122
04:22:22,709 --> 04:22:23,270
Something weird happened.

4123
04:22:23,270 --> 04:22:33,799
Like, it just put us in a game.

4124
04:22:33,799 --> 04:22:34,120
All right.

4125
04:22:34,120 --> 04:22:35,719
Just get in here and tank this.

4126
04:22:35,719 --> 04:22:48,340
Where are they?

4127
04:22:48,340 --> 04:22:52,579
Are they just, are they looking at items?

4128
04:22:55,760 --> 04:22:56,239
Why, what?

4129
04:22:56,239 --> 04:22:57,040
He stealthed?

4130
04:22:58,739 --> 04:22:59,459
What the fuck?

4131
04:23:01,280 --> 04:23:02,239
Where were they?

4132
04:23:02,239 --> 04:23:03,040
What the hell happened?

4133
04:23:03,040 --> 04:23:04,319
Were they hiding behind the tower?

4134
04:23:08,739 --> 04:23:10,260
I'm very confused.

4135
04:23:10,260 --> 04:23:11,780
What just happened?

4136
04:23:12,340 --> 04:23:22,120
Paulo goes into the sky.

4137
04:23:22,760 --> 04:23:29,520
Yeah, but doesn't he?

4138
04:23:29,520 --> 04:23:33,440
Oh, right, right, right.

4139
04:23:33,440 --> 04:23:35,120
But I don't, Freya was right there too.

4140
04:23:35,120 --> 04:23:36,239
Where did Freya come from?

4141
04:23:36,239 --> 04:23:39,219
I think it's going to keep the game open.

4142
04:23:39,219 --> 04:23:50,959
This is so eerie.

4143
04:23:50,959 --> 04:23:58,049
This is, something about this is just not right, right?

4144
04:23:58,049 --> 04:24:09,799
Well, there's no way we're going to be able to kill them.

4145
04:24:09,799 --> 04:24:13,079
Two late game characters that all they do is massive amounts of damage.

4146
04:24:13,799 --> 04:24:14,680
What am I going to do?

4147
04:24:14,680 --> 04:24:16,899
Jump on somebody's back and bite them?

4148
04:24:16,899 --> 04:24:22,149
Like, can I just see, Freya?

4149
04:24:22,149 --> 04:24:23,590
Can I just see something real quick?

4150
04:24:23,590 --> 04:24:25,110
Let me see something real quick.

4151
04:24:25,110 --> 04:24:25,989
Just real quick.

4152
04:24:25,989 --> 04:24:26,709
No, no, real quick.

4153
04:24:26,709 --> 04:24:28,149
I'm supposed to see something real quick.

4154
04:24:28,149 --> 04:24:29,190
Real quick, just real quick.

4155
04:24:30,149 --> 04:24:33,479
Okay, let me see.

4156
04:24:33,479 --> 04:24:34,760
Can I even hurt you?

4157
04:24:34,760 --> 04:24:38,020
Oh shit, I can hurt you.

4158
04:24:38,579 --> 04:24:40,719
That's so crazy.

4159
04:24:40,719 --> 04:24:41,680
Hold on, let me just one more thing.

4160
04:24:42,479 --> 04:24:43,909
Kill them both, kill them both, kill them both.

4161
04:24:43,909 --> 04:24:45,190
Quick, quick, quick, kill them both.

4162
04:24:45,190 --> 04:24:45,829
Go, go, go.

4163
04:24:46,709 --> 04:24:58,020
Yep, that's the one, that's the one.

4164
04:24:58,020 --> 04:25:10,719
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4165
04:25:10,719 --> 04:25:11,360
No honor?

4166
04:25:12,639 --> 04:25:14,360
You fight without honor.

4167
04:25:16,239 --> 04:25:18,500
You fight without honor.

4168
04:25:18,500 --> 04:25:20,420
Yeah, oh, but he did.

4169
04:25:21,059 --> 04:25:37,879
Kill it quick.

4170
04:25:38,440 --> 04:25:40,399
Oh shit.

4171
04:26:36,770 --> 04:26:41,360
Hey, um, hey, wait, wait, wait a second.

4172
04:26:41,360 --> 04:26:42,159
Wait a second.

4173
04:26:42,159 --> 04:26:45,110
The Bologna's, uh, lagging.

4174
04:26:45,110 --> 04:26:47,350
Bologna's mom was, uh, calling him.

4175
04:26:47,350 --> 04:26:49,889
Bologna's mom was calling.

4176
04:26:49,889 --> 04:26:51,780
Oh, we can go in, actually.

4177
04:26:51,780 --> 04:26:52,899
Go, go, go, fuck the jokes.

4178
04:26:53,620 --> 04:27:05,879
This is it, we win.

4179
04:27:05,879 --> 04:27:09,540
We just have to end the game.

4180
04:27:09,540 --> 04:27:15,559
I got this sick Bologna on my team.

4181
04:27:15,559 --> 04:27:22,079
Thank God.

4182
04:27:22,079 --> 04:27:25,010
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

4183
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:33,989
I'm wrapping around.

4184
04:27:33,989 --> 04:27:35,670
Oh no, she's so strong.

4185
04:27:35,670 --> 04:27:49,700
She's so strong.

4186
04:27:49,700 --> 04:27:50,500
She's so strong.

4187
04:27:51,299 --> 04:27:54,239
She just kills both of us in three hits.

4188
04:27:54,239 --> 04:27:54,719
Not even.

4189
04:27:54,719 --> 04:28:35,909
What the fuck just happened?

4190
04:28:35,909 --> 04:28:38,719
What?

4191
04:28:38,719 --> 04:28:40,319
No, no, this is not fair now.

4192
04:28:40,319 --> 04:28:45,780
DC?

4193
04:28:45,780 --> 04:28:47,059
No, that's not cool.

4194
04:28:47,059 --> 04:28:55,059
That was a DC.

4195
04:28:55,059 --> 04:28:56,020
Yeah, no, there's a DC.

4196
04:28:56,020 --> 04:28:56,899
There's a DC.

4197
04:28:56,899 --> 04:28:58,100
We can, no, no, you can't.

4198
04:28:58,100 --> 04:28:58,979
That's not fair.

4199
04:28:58,979 --> 04:29:01,799
If I had somebody else here, this would be much easier.

4200
04:29:11,959 --> 04:29:19,940
I'm down a player.

4201
04:29:19,940 --> 04:29:20,739
Oh man.

4202
04:29:21,459 --> 04:29:31,600
If only you were still here, you'd be able to run and finish the game.

4203
04:29:31,600 --> 04:29:34,479
What we should have done is you should have just stayed in the

4204
04:29:34,559 --> 04:29:36,879
fountain, pretended to DC.

4205
04:29:36,879 --> 04:29:39,280
They wouldn't have even attacked you.

4206
04:29:39,280 --> 04:29:41,440
Then you could have just walked down the lane right now.

4207
04:29:41,440 --> 04:29:43,879
Can you come back?

4208
04:29:43,879 --> 04:29:52,370
If you log into the game right now and just walk.

4209
04:29:52,370 --> 04:29:53,329
Oh man.

4210
04:29:53,329 --> 04:30:13,920
I'm done with this one.

4211
04:30:13,920 --> 04:30:14,639
That was fun.

4212
04:30:14,639 --> 04:30:15,760
Thank you for playing.

4213
04:30:15,760 --> 04:30:30,120
All right, now we're going to do a regular arena and then I'm probably going to stop.

4214
04:30:32,520 --> 04:30:33,799
We'll do like one or two more.

4215
04:30:33,799 --> 04:30:37,319
It's been a lot of fun though.

4216
04:30:37,319 --> 04:30:38,760
Hey, you know what?

4217
04:30:38,760 --> 04:30:45,030
This is actually, it's been a very long time since I've done anything like viewer game related.

4218
04:30:45,030 --> 04:30:48,079
We haven't done this in probably two or three years at least.

4219
04:30:48,399 --> 04:30:50,319
It's fun to play with you guys, it is.

4220
04:30:52,209 --> 04:30:55,729
Even if half of these games are just comedy games, right?

4221
04:30:59,239 --> 04:31:00,200
Let's do arena.

4222
04:31:00,200 --> 04:31:13,459
For a Japanese server, that actually ran very well.

4223
04:31:13,459 --> 04:31:14,340
That was weird.

4224
04:31:14,340 --> 04:31:22,399
All right.

4225
04:31:22,399 --> 04:31:23,040
Good password.

4226
04:31:23,040 --> 04:31:23,760
Let's see.

4227
04:31:23,760 --> 04:31:33,350
I can't wait for next week's my Thursday.

4228
04:31:33,350 --> 04:31:34,469
This is never happening ever again.

4229
04:31:36,100 --> 04:31:36,420
Maybe.

4230
04:31:37,940 --> 04:31:38,420
All right.

4231
04:31:38,420 --> 04:31:47,649
Here we are.

4232
04:31:47,649 --> 04:31:48,850
Everything looks good.

4233
04:31:48,850 --> 04:31:55,670
Password is an emote on Twitch.

4234
04:31:55,670 --> 04:32:07,059
More specifically, an emote on better Twitch TV.

4235
04:32:07,059 --> 04:32:08,899
But there are no capitals.

4236
04:32:08,899 --> 04:32:12,340
It's just the word.

4237
04:32:12,340 --> 04:32:19,639
All right.

4238
04:32:20,280 --> 04:32:21,959
Password is Pippo Happy.

4239
04:32:21,959 --> 04:32:29,200
Very cool.

4240
04:32:29,200 --> 04:32:42,850
Very good.

4241
04:32:42,850 --> 04:32:45,729
Very good.

4242
04:32:45,729 --> 04:32:46,850
I want to play.

4243
04:32:46,850 --> 04:32:52,100
That's like, I don't know, Zeus maybe?

4244
04:32:52,100 --> 04:32:55,250
Don't quit.

4245
04:32:55,250 --> 04:32:55,489
Yeah.

4246
04:32:55,489 --> 04:32:56,370
Don't quit.

4247
04:32:56,370 --> 04:32:56,850
Don't quit.

4248
04:32:56,850 --> 04:32:57,649
It's cool.

4249
04:32:57,649 --> 04:32:59,489
Although I don't know for arena though.

4250
04:32:59,489 --> 04:33:01,729
Probably bad because you need to fill the bag with minions.

4251
04:33:01,729 --> 04:33:02,850
Nah, probably not good for arena.

4252
04:33:07,830 --> 04:33:12,310
I kind of need a guardian.

4253
04:33:12,950 --> 04:33:18,869
All right.

4254
04:33:18,869 --> 04:33:19,830
I'm going to be a guardian.

4255
04:33:19,830 --> 04:33:20,310
I will be...

4256
04:33:20,950 --> 04:33:26,319
Oh, Ares.

4257
04:33:26,319 --> 04:33:26,959
We already have a...

4258
04:33:27,919 --> 04:33:31,439
I'm so sorry.

4259
04:33:31,439 --> 04:33:39,639
The person even selected guardian.

4260
04:33:40,200 --> 04:33:51,189
Looks like we're going damage Ares.

4261
04:33:51,189 --> 04:33:51,750
Yep.

4262
04:33:51,750 --> 04:34:10,930
Let's get a victory royale.

4263
04:34:10,930 --> 04:34:14,209
Let's try.

4264
04:34:14,770 --> 04:34:17,409
That's a crazy skin.

4265
04:34:17,409 --> 04:34:22,119
All right.

4266
04:34:22,119 --> 04:34:23,479
I'm just going to build magic damage.

4267
04:34:23,479 --> 04:34:25,270
See if I can get some kills.

4268
04:34:25,270 --> 04:34:30,759
Where's my eyes?

4269
04:34:30,759 --> 04:34:44,680
So the next stream is going to be...

4270
04:34:44,680 --> 04:34:46,020
I'm trying to keep...

4271
04:34:46,659 --> 04:34:48,340
I'm not sure if you guys have noticed.

4272
04:34:48,340 --> 04:34:50,720
I'm trying to do two days a week.

4273
04:34:50,720 --> 04:34:52,130
Instead of just once a week.

4274
04:34:53,360 --> 04:34:56,240
Once a week, Andy is officially probably over.

4275
04:34:56,240 --> 04:34:58,709
We are now twice a week, Andy.

4276
04:34:58,709 --> 04:35:03,169
Nice to meet you too.

4277
04:35:04,290 --> 04:35:05,270
All right.

4278
04:35:05,270 --> 04:35:05,830
What are they?

4279
04:35:05,830 --> 04:35:06,470
Voidstone?

4280
04:35:08,900 --> 04:35:09,939
Yeah, let's do Voidstone.

4281
04:35:10,819 --> 04:35:18,610
So whether that's Saturday, Sunday usually.

4282
04:35:20,099 --> 04:35:22,610
Or randomly during the week.

4283
04:35:22,930 --> 04:35:34,069
I'm trying to get back to two days a week.

4284
04:35:34,069 --> 04:35:38,150
I don't foresee a period where we ever will get back to three or four days a week.

4285
04:35:38,950 --> 04:35:41,029
But two is absolutely fine.

4286
04:35:41,029 --> 04:35:43,750
I think I'm very capable at this point to do it.

4287
04:35:48,979 --> 04:35:51,139
And the idea is that those will be on the weekend.

4288
04:35:51,139 --> 04:35:55,430
But as sometimes, you know, sometimes those plans change.

4289
04:35:57,479 --> 04:36:00,520
Current plan now is to stream probably on Monday or Tuesday from now.

4290
04:36:01,159 --> 04:36:06,720
Oh, shit.

4291
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:07,119
Already?

4292
04:36:09,159 --> 04:36:09,400
All right.

4293
04:36:09,400 --> 04:36:09,799
Let's do it.

4294
04:36:10,439 --> 04:36:18,840
We all did the same exact move.

4295
04:36:19,479 --> 04:36:25,669
How did that miss?

4296
04:36:25,669 --> 04:36:25,909
Really?

4297
04:36:35,990 --> 04:36:36,229
All right.

4298
04:36:36,229 --> 04:36:37,270
I need to get blink.

4299
04:36:37,270 --> 04:36:38,150
It's really important.

4300
04:36:43,200 --> 04:36:43,599
Get him.

4301
04:36:45,439 --> 04:36:50,310
Oh, I'm stuck.

4302
04:36:54,080 --> 04:36:54,720
I killed somebody.

4303
04:36:54,720 --> 04:36:55,200
Who did I kill?

4304
04:36:55,759 --> 04:37:05,270
Magical power, physical protection.

4305
04:37:05,270 --> 04:37:11,650
Yeah, Andy, I can't get it yet.

4306
04:37:11,650 --> 04:37:13,439
I'll get that'll be the next thing I get, though.

4307
04:37:13,439 --> 04:37:13,919
For sure.

4308
04:37:14,720 --> 04:37:26,360
What are these little things?

4309
04:37:26,360 --> 04:37:45,000
What am I going to play after this?

4310
04:37:47,009 --> 04:37:48,529
I don't know what the next thing I'll do is.

4311
04:37:49,169 --> 04:37:50,520
There are a bunch of options.

4312
04:37:50,520 --> 04:37:50,919
We'll see.

4313
04:37:55,779 --> 04:37:57,700
Oh, I thought you're going to walk backwards.

4314
04:38:00,639 --> 04:38:01,119
This is bad.

4315
04:38:02,930 --> 04:38:03,169
No.

4316
04:38:13,000 --> 04:38:14,040
So mad at that guy.

4317
04:38:15,540 --> 04:38:17,299
I'm infuriated at that guy.

4318
04:38:27,729 --> 04:38:28,450
They all get beads.

4319
04:38:28,450 --> 04:38:29,009
They probably did.

4320
04:38:33,729 --> 04:38:34,529
Outer Wilds.

4321
04:38:34,529 --> 04:38:45,540
No, I don't think so.

4322
04:38:45,540 --> 04:38:46,099
GTA.

4323
04:38:46,099 --> 04:38:48,630
You know what?

4324
04:38:48,630 --> 04:38:50,869
I cannot hit this shit to save my life right now.

4325
04:38:52,310 --> 04:38:53,349
Maybe I will play GTA.

4326
04:38:55,009 --> 04:38:56,130
That sounds actually like a lot of fun.

4327
04:38:57,619 --> 04:38:57,860
All right.

4328
04:38:57,860 --> 04:38:58,979
We're going to do GTA next, I think.

4329
04:39:09,909 --> 04:39:10,790
Kill somebody.

4330
04:39:11,349 --> 04:39:14,180
Oh, that's annoying.

4331
04:39:28,159 --> 04:39:29,119
Grand Theft Andy.

4332
04:39:29,680 --> 04:39:30,950
It seems like it might be fun.

4333
04:39:32,930 --> 04:39:33,569
Which one do I want?

4334
04:39:33,569 --> 04:39:34,290
I wanted this one.

4335
04:39:34,290 --> 04:39:40,340
This one here.

4336
04:39:40,340 --> 04:39:41,619
No, not GTA RP.

4337
04:39:41,619 --> 04:39:43,299
I would just play regular GTA online.

4338
04:39:44,020 --> 04:39:45,380
Do like the casino update or something.

4339
04:39:46,799 --> 04:39:48,080
Just it would just be mayhem.

4340
04:40:10,950 --> 04:40:12,470
Play the steam games.

4341
04:40:12,470 --> 04:40:13,990
That's oh, yeah, I could do that too.

4342
04:40:13,990 --> 04:40:15,810
That's absolutely what we could do.

4343
04:40:28,950 --> 04:40:29,189
No.

4344
04:40:40,799 --> 04:40:47,479
What about no umbrellas allowed?

4345
04:40:47,479 --> 04:40:48,279
That's another one too.

4346
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:54,639
There's options.

4347
04:41:03,919 --> 04:41:15,569
You cannot run from a reach.

4348
04:41:15,569 --> 04:41:17,569
Oh, that was a good one.

4349
04:41:18,209 --> 04:41:21,560
All right.

4350
04:41:21,560 --> 04:41:22,040
Can we do this?

4351
04:41:22,040 --> 04:41:22,680
Can we pull it back?

4352
04:41:25,029 --> 04:41:25,270
Yeah.

4353
04:41:26,069 --> 04:41:27,029
M Dicky Knights.

4354
04:41:27,029 --> 04:41:27,750
Absolutely.

4355
04:41:27,750 --> 04:41:29,270
Yeah, we got plenty of stuff to do.

4356
04:41:41,729 --> 04:41:42,689
Oh, this is where I die.

4357
04:41:46,319 --> 04:41:46,880
There we go.

4358
04:41:49,119 --> 04:41:49,360
Blink.

4359
04:41:50,319 --> 04:41:51,040
This is the good shit.

4360
04:41:58,880 --> 04:42:02,080
You do blink, hit four, and immediately run away.

4361
04:42:02,080 --> 04:42:08,759
What about Community Content Knights?

4362
04:42:08,759 --> 04:42:14,360
Community Content Knights can never return due to the DMCA stuff.

4363
04:42:14,360 --> 04:42:19,990
Those of you that remember those fondly,

4364
04:42:21,830 --> 04:42:26,069
we've watched almost entire uninterrupted scenes of Star Wars.

4365
04:42:26,709 --> 04:42:27,909
We cannot do that anymore.

4366
04:42:28,470 --> 04:42:33,319
I didn't get it.

4367
04:42:33,319 --> 04:42:34,959
All right.

4368
04:42:34,959 --> 04:42:35,360
Here we go.

4369
04:42:35,360 --> 04:42:36,000
Are you ready?

4370
04:42:36,000 --> 04:42:36,319
Ready?

4371
04:42:36,319 --> 04:42:36,639
Ready?

4372
04:42:36,639 --> 04:42:36,959
Ready?

4373
04:42:36,959 --> 04:42:37,279
Watch this.

4374
04:42:37,279 --> 04:42:37,599
Watch this.

4375
04:42:37,599 --> 04:42:37,919
Watch this.

4376
04:42:37,919 --> 04:42:38,240
Ready?

4377
04:42:38,240 --> 04:42:38,560
Ready?

4378
04:42:38,560 --> 04:42:38,880
Ready?

4379
04:42:38,880 --> 04:42:39,200
Ready?

4380
04:42:41,159 --> 04:42:42,360
Oh, it's a cooldown.

4381
04:42:42,360 --> 04:42:43,240
What happened?

4382
04:42:43,240 --> 04:42:44,439
What is wrong with you?

4383
04:42:45,080 --> 04:42:46,119
What's wrong with you?

4384
04:42:46,840 --> 04:42:48,040
What is wrong with you?

4385
04:42:48,840 --> 04:42:52,020
What's wrong with you?

4386
04:42:52,020 --> 04:42:53,299
I just can't pay attention to anything.

4387
04:42:58,759 --> 04:42:59,639
Geez, man.

4388
04:42:59,639 --> 04:43:01,880
I literally can't pay attention to anything.

4389
04:43:01,880 --> 04:43:14,919
I got it this time.

4390
04:43:30,770 --> 04:43:31,250
Kill him.

4391
04:43:31,810 --> 04:43:39,520
Oh, my God.

4392
04:43:39,520 --> 04:43:40,400
I didn't mean to press that.

4393
04:43:41,119 --> 04:43:51,810
Too much damage.

4394
04:43:57,360 --> 04:44:00,069
Oh, Thor.

4395
04:44:00,069 --> 04:44:00,470
Thank you.

4396
04:44:06,279 --> 04:44:16,720
Are you going to do anything for Halloween?

4397
04:44:18,630 --> 04:44:19,909
I'm actually not sure.

4398
04:44:19,909 --> 04:44:20,630
That's a good question.

4399
04:44:24,639 --> 04:44:26,159
I mean, I could do VR stuff again,

4400
04:44:26,159 --> 04:44:28,400
but I feel like I've done that the last couple of years.

4401
04:44:33,750 --> 04:44:34,630
Just do horror games.

4402
04:44:34,630 --> 04:44:35,349
Yeah, that's easy.

4403
04:44:36,419 --> 04:44:38,180
Should be fun and simple enough, right?

4404
04:44:38,180 --> 04:44:39,619
Maybe I'll wear a costume or something.

4405
04:44:51,590 --> 04:44:52,630
Oh, I didn't.

4406
04:44:52,630 --> 04:44:53,990
I did not do that at a good time.

4407
04:44:54,709 --> 04:44:57,560
What about public domain movie night?

4408
04:44:59,560 --> 04:45:01,639
There needs to be enough public domain movies for me to care about.

4409
04:45:13,729 --> 04:45:14,369
Free Stooges?

4410
04:45:14,369 --> 04:45:16,049
I don't think the Free Stooges is a public domain.

4411
04:45:17,009 --> 04:45:17,729
Didn't we look that up?

4412
04:45:18,450 --> 04:45:22,400
But yes, absolutely.

4413
04:45:22,400 --> 04:45:23,040
I would love to.

4414
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:25,119
If we can get a good and I don't want.

4415
04:45:25,119 --> 04:45:26,479
OK, here's let me rephrase that.

4416
04:45:28,150 --> 04:45:32,150
I want to watch old movies from like the 40s, like 50s.

4417
04:45:34,500 --> 04:45:36,740
I don't just because a movie's public domain.

4418
04:45:36,740 --> 04:45:39,220
I mean, if it came out in like 2018 or something,

4419
04:45:39,220 --> 04:45:40,659
I don't I want to watch the old shit.

4420
04:45:50,400 --> 04:45:51,919
We're losing very badly.

4421
04:45:52,479 --> 04:45:52,959
How though?

4422
04:45:58,279 --> 04:45:59,479
Nosferatu?

4423
04:45:59,479 --> 04:46:01,810
Let's compile a list.

4424
04:46:01,810 --> 04:46:02,130
I'll do that.

4425
04:46:02,130 --> 04:46:03,090
Maybe we'll do that for Halloween.

4426
04:46:04,720 --> 04:46:08,680
Yeah, either the night before or the night.

4427
04:46:09,799 --> 04:46:12,279
At some point, a day or so before Halloween, we'll do that.

4428
04:46:12,279 --> 04:46:20,470
It sounds like a fun Halloween stream.

4429
04:46:21,189 --> 04:46:26,799
No.

4430
04:46:27,680 --> 04:46:28,240
Oh, boy.

4431
04:46:28,240 --> 04:46:29,279
I just walked into everybody.

4432
04:46:30,450 --> 04:46:30,849
Oh, boy.

4433
04:46:30,849 --> 04:46:31,970
I'm just barely paying attention.

4434
04:46:31,970 --> 04:46:32,770
I got to stop this.

4435
04:46:33,409 --> 04:46:38,520
Why am I playing this game like it's a fucking clicker?

4436
04:46:39,680 --> 04:46:42,479
Like, oh, yeah, just like the glance over at it every now and then.

4437
04:46:43,360 --> 04:46:45,840
How many grandmas do I have cooking in the bakeries?

4438
04:46:45,840 --> 04:46:46,639
I don't know.

4439
04:46:46,639 --> 04:46:53,799
Physical power and magical power.

4440
04:46:53,799 --> 04:46:54,040
What?

4441
04:47:03,349 --> 04:47:04,869
OK, this is not over yet.

4442
04:47:05,590 --> 04:47:17,169
We get anybody?

4443
04:47:25,090 --> 04:47:25,970
Holy shit.

4444
04:47:28,419 --> 04:47:37,029
I think we're going to lose.

4445
04:47:37,669 --> 04:47:41,810
If I were to take a wild guess, I would say we're going to lose the game.

4446
04:47:47,240 --> 04:47:49,799
I've never seen triple life steal Aerie.

4447
04:47:50,610 --> 04:47:52,290
Well, come on.

4448
04:47:52,930 --> 04:47:54,049
Give it a try one day.

4449
04:47:54,049 --> 04:47:55,250
Maybe it'll work out for you.

4450
04:48:02,150 --> 04:48:04,150
You see that, you know, the funniest part about that.

4451
04:48:05,029 --> 04:48:07,029
I didn't even know that's what I was doing.

4452
04:48:07,029 --> 04:48:07,430
You did.

4453
04:48:08,580 --> 04:48:11,830
I didn't even know that's what I was doing until I just looked at it.

4454
04:48:12,389 --> 04:48:26,959
What are you going to eat after the stream?

4455
04:48:26,959 --> 04:48:28,319
Oh, probably tacos.

4456
04:48:28,880 --> 04:48:36,259
That sounds good, right?

4457
04:48:38,020 --> 04:48:39,060
How did that miss?

4458
04:48:39,060 --> 04:48:40,580
It went between the two of them.

4459
04:48:41,299 --> 04:48:48,740
I don't know what's going on.

4460
04:48:48,740 --> 04:48:58,159
I mean, this is a game for nerds.

4461
04:48:58,720 --> 04:49:01,380
I'll make sure I'll never play it again.

4462
04:49:01,380 --> 04:49:01,779
You're right.

4463
04:49:02,419 --> 04:49:05,029
I'll make sure I'll never play this again.

4464
04:49:05,029 --> 04:49:05,750
I didn't know that.

4465
04:49:05,750 --> 04:49:09,250
What is the way that nerds play this game?

4466
04:49:10,069 --> 04:49:11,349
Oh, I'm never playing it.

4467
04:49:11,349 --> 04:49:12,069
Are you kidding me?

4468
04:49:14,470 --> 04:49:15,590
Yeah, no, fuck that.

4469
04:49:15,590 --> 04:49:16,549
Never playing this again.

4470
04:49:18,450 --> 04:49:19,650
I did not know that.

4471
04:49:19,650 --> 04:49:21,970
So let me just make sure I make that clear.

4472
04:49:21,970 --> 04:49:28,279
How come there's not a nice costume?

4473
04:49:31,990 --> 04:49:33,270
All right, what do you say? One more?

4474
04:49:33,270 --> 04:49:35,029
Yeah, let's do one more.

4475
04:49:35,029 --> 04:49:47,639
We'll do, uh, assault.

4476
04:49:47,639 --> 04:49:51,299
Those are the most fun.

4477
04:49:58,950 --> 04:49:59,349
Good.

4478
04:49:59,349 --> 04:49:59,669
All right.

4479
04:49:59,669 --> 04:50:00,229
Off.

4480
04:50:00,229 --> 04:50:01,189
And password.

4481
04:50:01,990 --> 04:50:23,279
Password is a related to somebody in space, a movie that takes place in space.

4482
04:50:23,279 --> 04:50:33,889
A series of movies that take place in space.

4483
04:50:33,889 --> 04:50:41,799
This is a character from that series.

4484
04:50:41,799 --> 04:50:45,430
They're in no spaces.

4485
04:50:45,430 --> 04:50:50,119
Password was Darth Vader.

4486
04:50:50,119 --> 04:50:51,080
No spaces.

4487
04:50:51,080 --> 04:51:09,080
I don't want to play this character.

4488
04:51:09,080 --> 04:51:10,119
I don't know how this character plays.

4489
04:51:11,000 --> 04:51:12,040
Thank you so much.

4490
04:51:12,119 --> 04:51:14,360
You literally just saved the last game of the stream.

4491
04:51:14,360 --> 04:51:28,020
How many people are still watching?

4492
04:51:28,020 --> 04:51:32,560
There's actually a very fair amount of people still here.

4493
04:51:32,560 --> 04:51:34,560
I'm actually very surprised about that.

4494
04:51:34,560 --> 04:51:41,360
Thanks for sticking around.

4495
04:51:41,360 --> 04:51:45,360
Just playing some Smite, just messing around.

4496
04:51:45,360 --> 04:51:46,560
It's not a big deal.

4497
04:51:46,560 --> 04:52:00,580
Sometimes you have to remember what a video game looks like.

4498
04:52:00,580 --> 04:52:10,240
Smite 2015.

4499
04:52:10,240 --> 04:52:10,639
What is that?

4500
04:52:13,639 --> 04:52:14,599
Let us bet on this one?

4501
04:52:15,240 --> 04:52:15,479
Sure.

4502
04:52:17,360 --> 04:52:18,759
Open it up.

4503
04:52:18,759 --> 04:52:20,119
Does my team win this game?

4504
04:52:28,209 --> 04:52:32,150
Seems like we have, we're up against a legendary Belona,

4505
04:52:32,150 --> 04:52:35,139
but we do have two level.

4506
04:52:36,020 --> 04:52:36,979
I don't know what that number that was.

4507
04:52:44,340 --> 04:52:44,900
Cool down.

4508
04:52:44,900 --> 04:52:45,619
Absolutely.

4509
04:52:51,669 --> 04:52:53,349
And of course, Aegis.

4510
04:52:53,349 --> 04:52:54,709
It's just the guaranteed pick.

4511
04:52:54,709 --> 04:52:55,189
Let's go.

4512
04:52:58,400 --> 04:52:59,040
We're going to win.

4513
04:53:09,250 --> 04:53:10,689
Don't let us down all in on me.

4514
04:53:14,000 --> 04:53:14,799
I wouldn't do that.

4515
04:53:20,479 --> 04:53:21,119
Where are they?

4516
04:53:21,119 --> 04:53:21,599
Oh my God.

4517
04:53:24,240 --> 04:53:25,279
They're hiding over here.

4518
04:53:26,000 --> 04:53:26,720
Aren't they?

4519
04:53:27,360 --> 04:53:31,779
Where's the other team?

4520
04:53:32,419 --> 04:53:43,400
Nice try.

4521
04:53:44,799 --> 04:53:53,810
Where is everybody?

4522
04:53:53,810 --> 04:53:56,049
Didn't that go much further than it?

4523
04:53:56,049 --> 04:53:56,610
That was weird.

4524
04:54:03,009 --> 04:54:03,409
Uh oh.

4525
04:54:11,830 --> 04:54:14,229
I know the fucking tactics with Kulkulkan.

4526
04:54:14,790 --> 04:54:15,509
Don't think I don't.

4527
04:54:42,319 --> 04:54:45,430
I do remember when Kulkulkan was out, Kwong.

4528
04:54:45,430 --> 04:54:46,709
That's very old.

4529
04:54:46,709 --> 04:54:55,080
Get away from me.

4530
04:54:55,080 --> 04:54:55,319
What?

4531
04:54:55,319 --> 04:54:55,720
Retreat.

4532
04:54:56,360 --> 04:55:02,000
Jerma, look over here.

4533
04:55:02,000 --> 04:55:02,639
Look over here.

4534
04:55:02,639 --> 04:55:03,599
Leave me alone.

4535
04:55:03,599 --> 04:55:05,240
I don't want to look.

4536
04:55:05,240 --> 04:55:16,580
I thought the Sobek was going to go get that.

4537
04:55:16,580 --> 04:55:17,299
Hey, watch this.

4538
04:55:30,680 --> 04:55:31,319
We doing this?

4539
04:55:44,369 --> 04:55:44,849
Get.

4540
04:55:44,849 --> 04:55:56,520
Watch out.

4541
04:55:56,520 --> 04:55:57,319
Need that cool down.

4542
04:55:57,319 --> 04:55:59,240
The thing is, it takes so long to get that back.

4543
04:55:59,240 --> 04:56:06,740
Jerma, look behind you.

4544
04:56:11,299 --> 04:56:11,540
Yeah.

4545
04:56:12,659 --> 04:56:13,299
Yeah.

4546
04:56:13,299 --> 04:56:18,770
Be heck up.

4547
04:56:18,770 --> 04:56:19,729
Just cool down in mana.

4548
04:56:19,729 --> 04:56:24,040
That's all you do with Kulkulkan.

4549
04:56:24,040 --> 04:56:35,479
Get in the chopper.

4550
04:56:35,479 --> 04:56:36,119
Hey.

4551
04:56:36,119 --> 04:56:45,729
Oh, we're going to all pog mana heal.

4552
04:56:45,729 --> 04:56:47,700
Nice job.

4553
04:56:47,700 --> 04:56:59,680
Make it so the lane minions hit that.

4554
04:56:59,680 --> 04:57:05,840
Did that not hit the Sobek?

4555
04:57:05,840 --> 04:57:07,040
Oh, come on, Gwyn.

4556
04:57:07,040 --> 04:57:07,680
Give me a break.

4557
04:57:08,240 --> 04:57:10,259
That's going to get...

4558
04:57:10,259 --> 04:57:11,619
I'm going to get two kills there.

4559
04:57:11,619 --> 04:57:13,439
At least one.

4560
04:57:13,439 --> 04:57:29,919
All right.

4561
04:57:29,919 --> 04:57:30,319
Let's go.

4562
04:57:31,119 --> 04:57:32,720
Jerma of Isolation is amazing as well.

4563
04:57:33,439 --> 04:57:35,779
Especially on Kulkulkan.

4564
04:57:36,340 --> 04:57:43,729
Who's left?

4565
04:57:43,729 --> 04:57:44,209
Just the set.

4566
04:57:46,900 --> 04:57:49,139
I'm so glad that I traded the soul with that guy.

4567
04:57:49,700 --> 04:58:02,900
With the sniper rifle.

4568
04:58:02,900 --> 04:58:04,580
I'm not playing Neith.

4569
04:58:05,139 --> 04:58:17,509
Get that shit out of here.

4570
04:58:18,069 --> 04:58:29,380
Those little firework things are such a distraction.

4571
04:58:29,380 --> 04:58:39,080
Ooh.

4572
04:58:52,319 --> 04:59:10,880
Oh, shit.

4573
04:59:10,880 --> 04:59:14,610
Ooh.

4574
04:59:14,610 --> 04:59:16,130
Where the fuck did you come from?

4575
04:59:16,130 --> 04:59:16,369
What?

4576
04:59:17,939 --> 04:59:18,740
Why does the person keep...

4577
04:59:18,740 --> 04:59:19,860
Why can they just do that?

4578
04:59:19,860 --> 04:59:20,580
What?

4579
04:59:20,580 --> 04:59:24,580
Where did the person even come from?

4580
04:59:29,169 --> 04:59:30,450
Was that Belona?

4581
04:59:30,450 --> 04:59:31,970
He walked right by me.

4582
04:59:31,970 --> 04:59:37,650
Did he blink?

4583
04:59:37,650 --> 04:59:51,000
How did I not see him?

4584
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:52,479
I don't know.

4585
04:59:52,479 --> 04:59:55,270
This game takes a shitload of brain power.

4586
04:59:55,270 --> 04:59:56,950
I don't have any right now.

4587
05:00:01,240 --> 05:00:02,759
You have to understand something.

4588
05:00:02,759 --> 05:00:04,680
When you cross 30 years old,

4589
05:00:04,759 --> 05:00:07,639
your brain slows down every year till you get to 80.

4590
05:00:09,319 --> 05:00:16,479
My brain has declined since I was like 25.

4591
05:00:16,479 --> 05:00:17,040
It's real.

4592
05:00:20,819 --> 05:00:26,560
I'm closer to 40 than I am 25.

4593
05:00:26,560 --> 05:00:29,540
I'm closer to 40 than I am 30.

4594
05:00:29,540 --> 05:00:32,659
I'm playing incredibly well for a fucking 40-year-old.

4595
05:00:32,659 --> 05:00:33,299
Check that out.

4596
05:00:53,159 --> 05:00:55,240
Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him.

4597
05:00:55,240 --> 05:00:55,740
Oh.

4598
05:01:06,880 --> 05:01:16,180
Damn it.

4599
05:01:16,180 --> 05:01:17,060
He's so close.

4600
05:01:25,830 --> 05:01:26,389
How old are you?

4601
05:01:26,389 --> 05:01:27,430
I'm 36.

4602
05:01:27,430 --> 05:01:29,830
I thought that was common knowledge.

4603
05:01:29,830 --> 05:01:37,240
Goodbye.

4604
05:01:37,240 --> 05:01:48,040
He just said you were 40.

4605
05:01:48,040 --> 05:01:50,599
Now I said I was closer to 40 than I am 40.

4606
05:01:50,599 --> 05:02:01,040
Stop.

4607
05:02:01,040 --> 05:02:02,240
Don't let him get away.

4608
05:02:10,369 --> 05:02:11,490
You age pretty well.

4609
05:02:11,490 --> 05:02:12,849
I feel like I have aged pretty well.

4610
05:02:21,139 --> 05:02:22,419
I think I'm aging pretty gracefully.

4611
05:02:22,979 --> 05:02:28,439
You could use that.

4612
05:02:29,080 --> 05:02:30,119
You're going to give it...

4613
05:02:30,119 --> 05:02:31,000
Did you try to steal it?

4614
05:02:31,000 --> 05:02:31,720
Oh, no, no, no.

4615
05:02:31,720 --> 05:02:32,279
I see.

4616
05:02:32,279 --> 05:02:48,319
Remember, stop talking about how old you are.

4617
05:02:48,319 --> 05:02:49,360
It makes me feel old.

4618
05:02:52,000 --> 05:02:52,959
Oh, he's...

4619
05:02:52,959 --> 05:03:04,450
It's way too late as top 10 videos of streamers you used to watch.

4620
05:03:04,450 --> 05:03:07,299
It's like, you feel old yet?

4621
05:03:07,299 --> 05:03:08,959
Number nine.

4622
05:03:08,959 --> 05:03:10,580
German985.

4623
05:03:10,580 --> 05:03:13,060
And it's a picture of me from, like, paparazzi getting out of the car.

4624
05:03:13,060 --> 05:03:16,340
And I have a bald head, gray hair, like, big bottle glasses.

4625
05:03:19,040 --> 05:03:19,759
Oh, my God.

4626
05:03:19,759 --> 05:03:20,639
This is what happens when I talk.

4627
05:03:21,279 --> 05:03:28,290
It's to hit somebody.

4628
05:03:35,619 --> 05:03:36,580
Yeah, I think.

4629
05:03:36,580 --> 05:03:42,930
This is very even.

4630
05:03:42,930 --> 05:04:03,490
20 years...

4631
05:04:03,490 --> 05:04:04,209
Number four.

4632
05:04:04,209 --> 05:04:05,090
The sus guy.

4633
05:04:07,299 --> 05:04:12,360
I don't think Among Us is going to make it another 20 years,

4634
05:04:12,360 --> 05:04:14,439
keeping the same popularity it has now.

4635
05:04:14,439 --> 05:04:16,439
But I would love to be corrected.

4636
05:04:17,080 --> 05:04:35,090
It's not even popular anymore now.

4637
05:04:35,810 --> 05:04:36,450
It still is.

4638
05:04:38,340 --> 05:04:39,060
You can gauge that...

4639
05:04:39,860 --> 05:04:40,259
All right.

4640
05:04:40,259 --> 05:04:41,619
Before you say that.

4641
05:04:41,619 --> 05:04:42,340
Oh, God.

4642
05:04:43,139 --> 05:04:43,639
No!

4643
05:04:45,959 --> 05:04:46,759
I have to...

4644
05:04:56,340 --> 05:04:56,900
Well, let me make...

4645
05:04:56,900 --> 05:05:00,119
Let me now make the point.

4646
05:05:00,119 --> 05:05:02,919
You have to judge that based on how many Halloween costumes you see this year.

4647
05:05:09,279 --> 05:05:12,159
If you see, personally, you walking around,

4648
05:05:12,720 --> 05:05:17,860
more than five Among Us character inflatable costumes,

4649
05:05:18,659 --> 05:05:20,580
it's still as popular as it was.

4650
05:05:38,680 --> 05:05:46,500
Gonna be squid game.

4651
05:05:46,500 --> 05:05:48,900
Yeah, it's gonna be squid game.

4652
05:05:48,900 --> 05:05:51,250
It's gonna be Among Us.

4653
05:05:52,520 --> 05:05:56,680
And a bunch of really in-character Dark Knight jokers.

4654
05:05:56,680 --> 05:05:58,040
That's every Halloween party.

4655
05:05:58,040 --> 05:06:17,619
What about sexy Among Us?

4656
05:06:18,180 --> 05:06:21,799
What do you mean?

4657
05:06:21,799 --> 05:06:38,849
Win the game?

4658
05:06:38,849 --> 05:06:39,810
I think we're in a pretty...

4659
05:06:39,810 --> 05:06:40,049
All right.

4660
05:06:40,049 --> 05:06:42,290
If I pay attention, maybe we'll do it.

4661
05:06:42,290 --> 05:06:53,040
I was gonna do it, but now it's not necessary.

4662
05:06:53,040 --> 05:06:56,229
I think...

4663
05:06:56,229 --> 05:06:57,090
How are you still...

4664
05:06:57,090 --> 05:06:58,130
The person's alive still.

4665
05:07:02,680 --> 05:07:03,180
Uh-oh.

4666
05:07:07,759 --> 05:07:23,909
Enemy has left the game.

4667
05:07:23,909 --> 05:07:24,409
Watch it.

4668
05:07:40,240 --> 05:07:44,290
Nice.

4669
05:07:44,290 --> 05:07:45,729
R.I.P. doubters.

4670
05:07:45,729 --> 05:07:47,520
Don't say that yet.

4671
05:07:47,520 --> 05:07:49,520
I've seen plenty of assault games where it's 4v5,

4672
05:07:49,520 --> 05:07:50,639
and the other team gets destroyed.

4673
05:07:56,400 --> 05:07:56,900
Get!

4674
05:08:11,060 --> 05:08:17,040
It's not over yet.

4675
05:08:17,040 --> 05:08:17,919
Not yet.

4676
05:08:17,919 --> 05:08:26,979
Now it actually might be over.

4677
05:08:29,439 --> 05:08:30,000
Very possible.

4678
05:08:44,209 --> 05:08:45,639
Treat!

4679
05:08:45,639 --> 05:08:46,439
We can kill this thing.

4680
05:08:47,159 --> 05:08:56,900
Good game.

4681
05:08:56,900 --> 05:08:57,939
Good game.

4682
05:08:57,939 --> 05:09:06,099
All the doubters, yeah.

4683
05:09:06,099 --> 05:09:08,560
All right.

4684
05:09:08,560 --> 05:09:09,599
One more, one more.

4685
05:09:09,599 --> 05:09:10,159
One more.

4686
05:09:10,159 --> 05:09:11,990
I wanna do one more.

4687
05:09:11,990 --> 05:09:22,360
Last one.

4688
05:09:22,360 --> 05:09:23,000
This is it.

4689
05:09:23,000 --> 05:09:24,529
It's the final game of the night.

4690
05:09:24,529 --> 05:09:26,689
I'm gonna do a assault.

4691
05:09:26,689 --> 05:09:43,139
Password is going to be...

4692
05:09:43,139 --> 05:09:53,880
This is all lowercase.

4693
05:09:53,880 --> 05:10:03,479
Lowercase only.

4694
05:10:03,479 --> 05:10:07,169
I'm not gonna give any hints.

4695
05:10:07,169 --> 05:10:08,049
I wanna see if anybody gets it.

4696
05:10:14,950 --> 05:10:18,630
Please tell Hashouse or GoGo to update their online hours.

4697
05:10:18,630 --> 05:10:21,509
I told my parents to get the blue cheeseburger that you recommended,

4698
05:10:21,509 --> 05:10:25,799
and they were closed even though the website said open.

4699
05:10:25,799 --> 05:10:26,680
Oh, shit.

4700
05:10:26,680 --> 05:10:30,799
Password is omega lol with no spaces, no capitals.

4701
05:10:44,560 --> 05:10:45,439
Yeah, all right.

4702
05:10:45,439 --> 05:10:46,159
I'm not...

4703
05:10:46,159 --> 05:10:48,959
I have no affiliation with Hashouse or GoGo.

4704
05:10:48,959 --> 05:10:49,759
I just like the place.

4705
05:10:50,479 --> 05:10:57,729
I can't, like, rent a skin.

4706
05:10:58,290 --> 05:11:05,090
I'm sorry.

4707
05:11:05,090 --> 05:11:08,099
I know Sun Wukong's moves.

4708
05:11:08,099 --> 05:11:14,740
I don't know Apua.

4709
05:11:14,740 --> 05:11:15,779
Is it Apua?

4710
05:11:15,779 --> 05:11:20,279
Who is that?

4711
05:11:20,279 --> 05:11:21,560
Is it Donkey Kong?

4712
05:11:21,560 --> 05:11:38,040
I can't believe you're playing this game.

4713
05:11:38,040 --> 05:11:42,200
The power of three people in pre-stream chat.

4714
05:11:42,200 --> 05:11:47,029
Don't ever feel like you cannot influence my decisions.

4715
05:11:47,029 --> 05:11:49,189
Actually, three or four people in pre-stream, like,

4716
05:11:49,990 --> 05:11:51,270
yesterday, the day before.

4717
05:11:51,270 --> 05:11:52,790
That's the reason why we're doing this.

4718
05:11:52,790 --> 05:11:58,389
These skins are insane.

4719
05:12:01,939 --> 05:12:02,419
Oh, boy.

4720
05:12:02,419 --> 05:12:03,220
This is gonna be bad.

4721
05:12:05,330 --> 05:12:10,069
One, two, three, three level 10 legendary players.

4722
05:12:10,069 --> 05:12:11,970
We have two.

4723
05:12:11,970 --> 05:12:12,770
Diamond servers.

4724
05:12:12,770 --> 05:12:13,409
Ah, you have to...

4725
05:12:13,409 --> 05:12:13,729
These...

4726
05:12:13,729 --> 05:12:16,930
Yeah, it's like 500 games.

4727
05:12:16,930 --> 05:12:18,930
I'm so outclassed right now.

4728
05:12:18,930 --> 05:12:25,299
I feel like I got rushed and carried through a place I'm not supposed to be.

4729
05:12:25,860 --> 05:12:35,799
What do they have?

4730
05:12:36,599 --> 05:12:38,759
Physical, physical, physical.

4731
05:12:39,560 --> 05:12:40,759
It's all physical.

4732
05:12:40,759 --> 05:12:41,560
All right.

4733
05:12:41,560 --> 05:12:41,959
Yeah.

4734
05:12:41,959 --> 05:12:42,759
Let's go with this.

4735
05:12:42,759 --> 05:12:43,400
Sovereignty.

4736
05:12:51,889 --> 05:12:53,729
My favorite part about this is this.

4737
05:12:53,729 --> 05:12:54,529
When he goes,

4738
05:12:54,529 --> 05:12:58,819
TRANSFORM.

4739
05:12:58,819 --> 05:12:59,779
Say it.

4740
05:12:59,779 --> 05:13:08,930
He goes,

4741
05:13:08,930 --> 05:13:10,130
TRANSFORM.

4742
05:13:10,130 --> 05:13:12,099
Yeah, I gotta get him to say it.

4743
05:13:12,659 --> 05:13:15,880
The tank already has sovereignty.

4744
05:13:17,319 --> 05:13:17,639
All right.

4745
05:13:17,639 --> 05:13:18,279
I'll get another one.

4746
05:13:22,919 --> 05:13:23,319
Say it.

4747
05:13:23,880 --> 05:13:36,819
Don't ever do a funny noise.

4748
05:13:36,819 --> 05:13:37,619
It'll make me LOL.

4749
05:13:38,419 --> 05:13:41,000
Did it work?

4750
05:13:51,700 --> 05:13:52,500
No, try again.

4751
05:13:53,540 --> 05:14:14,930
Did it work?

4752
05:14:14,930 --> 05:14:15,810
I have no mana left.

4753
05:14:19,490 --> 05:14:20,529
No, try again.

4754
05:14:20,529 --> 05:14:20,849
Again?

4755
05:14:21,569 --> 05:14:33,360
Careful.

4756
05:14:36,080 --> 05:14:37,279
TRANSFORM.

4757
05:14:38,240 --> 05:14:45,299
Stunning.

4758
05:14:46,880 --> 05:14:47,360
Stunned him.

4759
05:14:55,029 --> 05:14:55,669
Yes, tank.

4760
05:14:56,310 --> 05:15:00,200
I feel like I'm playing Kingdom Hearts.

4761
05:15:04,610 --> 05:15:21,279
The AI characters are just talking to each other.

4762
05:15:21,279 --> 05:15:22,080
Say it.

4763
05:15:22,080 --> 05:15:28,310
I'm just waiting for him to go.

4764
05:15:28,869 --> 05:15:29,990
Don't give up.

4765
05:15:29,990 --> 05:15:30,869
Don't give up.

4766
05:15:35,330 --> 05:15:40,849
Don't give up.

4767
05:15:40,849 --> 05:15:42,040
Sora.

4768
05:15:42,040 --> 05:15:42,520
Sora.

4769
05:15:44,819 --> 05:15:45,700
Don't give up.

4770
05:15:45,700 --> 05:15:46,180
Sora.

4771
05:15:51,639 --> 05:15:52,360
Attack.

4772
05:15:53,080 --> 05:15:54,200
Attack.

4773
05:15:54,200 --> 05:15:55,000
Attack.

4774
05:16:13,459 --> 05:16:14,340
They're gonna jump on us.

4775
05:16:14,979 --> 05:16:15,619
Don't touch me.

4776
05:16:23,360 --> 05:16:24,560
No, he didn't say it.

4777
05:16:24,560 --> 05:16:33,080
I gotta go back.

4778
05:16:37,669 --> 05:16:39,029
I got my help ready.

4779
05:16:39,029 --> 05:16:40,360
I'm ready to go in.

4780
05:16:41,759 --> 05:16:42,720
I'm ready to go in.

4781
05:16:42,720 --> 05:16:43,680
Say the word.

4782
05:16:43,680 --> 05:16:44,080
Say it.

4783
05:16:44,080 --> 05:16:44,400
It's done.

4784
05:16:49,860 --> 05:16:50,180
Fuck it.

4785
05:16:50,180 --> 05:16:50,500
Go in.

4786
05:16:50,500 --> 05:16:50,819
Let's go.

4787
05:16:51,459 --> 05:16:58,979
Clean it up.

4788
05:16:58,979 --> 05:17:08,319
Physical protection.

4789
05:17:08,319 --> 05:17:09,360
Crowd control reduction.

4790
05:17:09,360 --> 05:17:09,840
Oh, yeah.

4791
05:17:10,560 --> 05:17:11,040
Thank you.

4792
05:17:11,680 --> 05:17:15,459
Oh, it's that...

4793
05:17:16,259 --> 05:17:18,419
Is that Sir Finley Markleton?

4794
05:17:19,139 --> 05:17:34,880
I love how people hate that.

4795
05:17:35,759 --> 05:17:39,279
Can I change my bet?

4796
05:17:40,659 --> 05:17:40,979
We're gonna...

4797
05:17:41,860 --> 05:17:42,020
Oh.

4798
05:17:43,939 --> 05:17:55,909
Ultimate is ready.

4799
05:17:55,909 --> 05:17:57,189
I don't know how to do the key combination,

4800
05:17:57,189 --> 05:17:58,470
so I just set it on spring.

4801
05:17:58,470 --> 05:18:04,049
Oh, my ult's not even ready.

4802
05:18:04,049 --> 05:18:14,159
I don't know.

4803
05:18:14,159 --> 05:18:15,759
I feel like we're all larping right now.

4804
05:18:16,319 --> 05:18:27,639
Kill.

4805
05:18:32,950 --> 05:18:33,509
Uh-oh.

4806
05:18:33,509 --> 05:18:34,069
Uh-oh.

4807
05:18:35,270 --> 05:18:35,669
Uh-oh.

4808
05:18:38,950 --> 05:18:39,909
Watch out.

4809
05:18:39,909 --> 05:18:40,310
Watch out.

4810
05:18:40,310 --> 05:18:40,630
Watch out.

4811
05:18:40,630 --> 05:18:41,909
A guy's coming for you.

4812
05:18:41,909 --> 05:18:42,470
Watch out.

4813
05:18:43,110 --> 05:18:48,049
Watch out.

4814
05:18:48,049 --> 05:18:48,770
It's Loki.

4815
05:18:49,409 --> 05:18:53,009
He's a trickster.

4816
05:18:55,349 --> 05:18:55,669
What?

4817
05:18:56,310 --> 05:18:58,549
I tried to press the fucking button.

4818
05:18:58,549 --> 05:18:59,830
I could have killed all three of them.

4819
05:19:00,389 --> 05:19:01,169
If I just...

4820
05:19:01,810 --> 05:19:17,299
He's like a five-year-old having a tantrum.

4821
05:19:18,479 --> 05:19:19,439
You want to hear a tantrum?

4822
05:19:19,439 --> 05:19:20,400
I'll give you a tantrum.

4823
05:19:20,959 --> 05:19:26,069
I'll show you a tantrum.

4824
05:19:42,130 --> 05:19:52,630
That's a cool skin.

4825
05:19:52,630 --> 05:19:54,069
Oh, yep.

4826
05:19:54,069 --> 05:19:56,310
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

4827
05:19:57,189 --> 05:19:57,590
Oh.

4828
05:19:58,709 --> 05:20:18,740
This is hurting me.

4829
05:20:19,299 --> 05:20:30,950
Whoever did that...

4830
05:20:30,950 --> 05:20:31,110
What?

4831
05:20:31,110 --> 05:20:31,990
I don't know what move that was,

4832
05:20:31,990 --> 05:20:33,349
but holy shit, it was good.

4833
05:20:33,349 --> 05:20:37,509
Let's hit...

4834
05:20:38,150 --> 05:20:48,659
Ice cream is on its way.

4835
05:20:49,299 --> 05:20:51,139
Michael's been such a good boy this year.

4836
05:20:52,020 --> 05:20:53,729
Open up your gift.

4837
05:20:54,369 --> 05:20:55,250
Probably aren't you?

4838
05:20:55,970 --> 05:20:58,229
I'm gonna die.

4839
05:20:58,790 --> 05:20:59,189
I'm dead.

4840
05:21:15,270 --> 05:21:16,849
I thought you got hacked.

4841
05:21:24,180 --> 05:21:24,500
Good.

4842
05:21:24,500 --> 05:21:25,299
Come on, Cerberus.

4843
05:21:26,020 --> 05:21:34,340
Cerberus, what?

4844
05:21:34,900 --> 05:21:36,979
What is the Cerberus doing?

4845
05:21:40,740 --> 05:21:41,459
Got it.

4846
05:21:41,459 --> 05:21:41,860
Finally.

4847
05:21:46,069 --> 05:21:56,580
We're almost at a victory here.

4848
05:21:58,159 --> 05:21:59,200
You gotta go out on a good one.

4849
05:22:06,549 --> 05:22:07,430
I got it.

4850
05:22:07,430 --> 05:22:08,630
As I said, that would've been embarrassing.

4851
05:22:10,439 --> 05:22:10,919
He's dead.

4852
05:22:11,639 --> 05:22:12,119
Where is he?

4853
05:22:12,680 --> 05:22:13,159
Is he dead?

4854
05:22:13,880 --> 05:22:15,759
Yeah, we got him.

4855
05:22:21,279 --> 05:22:22,000
Yeah.

4856
05:22:22,000 --> 05:22:33,409
This is dangerous.

4857
05:22:33,970 --> 05:22:35,349
This is too dangerous.

4858
05:22:35,349 --> 05:22:35,990
I don't like this.

4859
05:22:36,709 --> 05:22:37,439
I don't like this.

4860
05:22:37,439 --> 05:22:37,759
I'm out.

4861
05:22:39,680 --> 05:22:40,720
No, I'm leaving.

4862
05:22:40,720 --> 05:22:45,430
It's too scary.

4863
05:22:45,430 --> 05:22:45,990
There's too many.

4864
05:22:46,630 --> 05:22:48,930
There are too many.

4865
05:22:49,490 --> 05:22:55,409
I'll help you.

4866
05:22:58,720 --> 05:22:59,360
Oh, man.

4867
05:23:00,479 --> 05:23:20,880
Oh, kill this motherfucker.

4868
05:23:20,880 --> 05:23:22,979
He's got like no health.

4869
05:23:22,979 --> 05:23:24,020
Excuse me?

4870
05:23:25,939 --> 05:23:26,740
Why was he...

4871
05:23:26,740 --> 05:23:27,540
I couldn't hurt him.

4872
05:23:28,099 --> 05:23:38,049
I don't know what the fuck I was doing there.

4873
05:23:38,770 --> 05:23:46,880
Oh, no.

4874
05:23:46,880 --> 05:23:47,040
Stop.

4875
05:23:47,040 --> 05:23:48,000
I don't want that.

4876
05:23:48,000 --> 05:23:59,880
Favorite God, Anubis.

4877
05:23:59,880 --> 05:24:03,459
Stone of Fall.

4878
05:24:03,459 --> 05:24:05,400
It's OP on you.

4879
05:24:05,400 --> 05:24:06,759
Stone of Fall.

4880
05:24:06,759 --> 05:24:12,040
Stone of Fall?

4881
05:24:12,040 --> 05:24:13,830
Stone of Fall.

4882
05:24:13,830 --> 05:24:32,000
Kill anybody's game.

4883
05:24:32,000 --> 05:24:40,520
Everybody's here.

4884
05:24:40,520 --> 05:24:43,840
They don't have very much health.

4885
05:24:43,840 --> 05:24:46,319
We could really cause a little bit of a problem for them here.

4886
05:24:46,319 --> 05:24:56,310
Oops.

4887
05:24:56,310 --> 05:25:04,279
Oh, actually, that was amazing.

4888
05:25:04,279 --> 05:25:05,799
That guy thought I was an idiot.

4889
05:25:05,799 --> 05:25:07,650
I've been so...

4890
05:25:07,650 --> 05:25:08,689
I've been playing so poorly

4891
05:25:09,250 --> 05:25:11,409
that he thought the decoy was actually me.

4892
05:25:11,409 --> 05:25:12,529
And he's like, this is definitely Jeremy.

4893
05:25:12,529 --> 05:25:13,250
He's an idiot.

4894
05:25:13,250 --> 05:25:24,080
Ouch.

4895
05:25:24,080 --> 05:25:24,560
It's gonna hurt.

4896
05:25:32,000 --> 05:25:33,439
The ultimate long con.

4897
05:25:46,419 --> 05:25:47,299
That's Loki, right?

4898
05:25:47,299 --> 05:25:47,779
That acid.

4899
05:25:48,340 --> 05:25:51,970
Oh, we don't get cocky here.

4900
05:25:51,970 --> 05:25:53,650
We have a tower still.

4901
05:25:53,650 --> 05:25:54,849
We don't have to get cocky.

4902
05:25:54,849 --> 05:26:09,880
That's from the Loki rework.

4903
05:26:09,880 --> 05:26:29,349
I feel like they re-did Loki three or four times.

4904
05:26:29,349 --> 05:26:30,069
Cut!

4905
05:26:30,069 --> 05:26:39,060
Where am I going?

4906
05:26:39,060 --> 05:26:39,459
Where am I going?

4907
05:26:39,459 --> 05:26:40,500
Where am I going?

4908
05:26:40,500 --> 05:26:41,279
Oh, shit.

4909
05:26:41,279 --> 05:26:41,919
I'm in trouble.

4910
05:26:45,319 --> 05:27:05,970
What was I gonna buy this?

4911
05:27:06,770 --> 05:27:07,090
Yeah.

4912
05:27:07,650 --> 05:27:17,880
I think we won.

4913
05:27:26,360 --> 05:27:26,840
Oh, no.

4914
05:27:29,400 --> 05:27:30,439
Oh, no.

4915
05:27:30,439 --> 05:27:42,849
I keep pressing yes.

4916
05:27:42,849 --> 05:27:43,330
I don't know why.

4917
05:27:43,330 --> 05:27:44,209
I think it's funny.

4918
05:27:44,209 --> 05:27:54,229
All right.

4919
05:27:54,229 --> 05:27:56,630
Can you just, as Kuzenbo,

4920
05:27:56,630 --> 05:27:59,110
can you just say yes, the loud one over and over again?

4921
05:27:59,110 --> 05:28:11,650
Okay, cocky.

4922
05:28:21,409 --> 05:28:22,450
It's just sound effects.

4923
05:28:25,799 --> 05:28:29,349
That's just a cookie crisp.

4924
05:28:31,509 --> 05:28:32,470
Cookie crisp.

4925
05:28:49,060 --> 05:28:50,819
Oh, I was being cocky.

4926
05:28:50,819 --> 05:28:51,779
I was being cocky.

4927
05:28:59,000 --> 05:29:01,479
I am an alien character.

4928
05:29:01,479 --> 05:29:03,240
I am an alien.

4929
05:29:03,240 --> 05:29:06,770
It's me, an alien.

4930
05:29:06,770 --> 05:29:08,290
I am an alien character.

4931
05:29:08,290 --> 05:29:09,169
It's me.

4932
05:29:09,169 --> 05:29:09,669
Look out.

4933
05:29:10,450 --> 05:29:11,810
Take me to your leader.

4934
05:29:11,810 --> 05:29:13,330
I am an alien in every game.

4935
05:29:14,209 --> 05:29:15,650
In every piece of media.

4936
05:29:16,209 --> 05:29:30,869
Fuck it.

4937
05:29:30,869 --> 05:29:38,529
Don't let him out.

4938
05:29:42,389 --> 05:29:43,349
I turned into a lion.

4939
05:30:06,560 --> 05:30:12,229
I don't want to.

4940
05:30:12,229 --> 05:30:12,709
My KD.

4941
05:30:12,709 --> 05:30:13,189
My KD.

4942
05:30:13,189 --> 05:30:14,069
Somebody else die.

4943
05:30:14,069 --> 05:30:17,220
My KD.

4944
05:30:17,220 --> 05:30:18,180
I don't want my KD.

4945
05:30:18,180 --> 05:30:18,819
My KD is bad.

4946
05:30:19,380 --> 05:30:32,360
Get him.

4947
05:30:32,360 --> 05:30:33,159
Hit this guy.

4948
05:30:33,720 --> 05:30:34,360
Hit the guy.

4949
05:30:36,200 --> 05:30:49,250
One more.

4950
05:30:49,250 --> 05:30:53,590
All right.

4951
05:30:53,590 --> 05:30:53,909
One more.

4952
05:30:53,909 --> 05:30:55,430
But this one's gonna be a comedy one.

4953
05:30:55,430 --> 05:31:11,400
The last one.

4954
05:31:11,400 --> 05:31:38,470
Here we go.

4955
05:31:38,470 --> 05:31:40,599
This is the last one.

4956
05:31:40,599 --> 05:31:45,439
This one you're seeing right now is going to be the last one.

4957
05:31:45,439 --> 05:31:53,360
Last one.

4958
05:31:53,360 --> 05:31:56,770
Asper was the last one.

4959
05:31:56,770 --> 05:31:57,569
Thanks for playing.

4960
05:32:05,990 --> 05:32:06,709
I don't know.

4961
05:32:06,709 --> 05:32:10,720
I'm gonna re-roll.

4962
05:32:10,720 --> 05:32:12,159
I can't re-roll.

4963
05:32:12,159 --> 05:32:17,520
I thought you could.

4964
05:32:17,520 --> 05:32:18,400
Sure.

4965
05:32:18,400 --> 05:32:20,900
I'll play Sun Wukong.

4966
05:32:20,900 --> 05:32:54,900
No, that's too much pressure.

4967
05:32:54,900 --> 05:32:56,180
They have voice lines too.

4968
05:33:04,630 --> 05:33:05,830
I don't know if you should do a bet for this one.

4969
05:33:05,830 --> 05:33:07,619
This could be anybody's game.

4970
05:33:07,619 --> 05:33:08,419
It's just...

4971
05:33:08,419 --> 05:33:13,189
Everyone's gonna be level 20 with 100,000 gold.

4972
05:33:13,189 --> 05:33:15,729
It's gonna be an absolute nightmare.

4973
05:33:15,729 --> 05:33:16,930
We already won.

4974
05:33:16,930 --> 05:33:20,709
We win.

4975
05:33:20,709 --> 05:33:23,430
Osiris Horus Bakasura.

4976
05:33:24,229 --> 05:33:24,790
Yeah.

4977
05:33:24,790 --> 05:33:42,529
If we don't win this game, come on.

4978
05:33:42,529 --> 05:33:46,119
Although, find out.

4979
05:33:51,430 --> 05:33:51,930
All right.

4980
05:33:52,790 --> 05:33:53,509
This.

4981
05:33:54,610 --> 05:33:57,759
What do they got?

4982
05:33:57,759 --> 05:34:02,369
They got a lot of physical, physical, physical, physical.

4983
05:34:03,009 --> 05:34:04,130
Yeah, all physical.

4984
05:34:04,130 --> 05:34:05,729
Just build only physical protection.

4985
05:34:14,470 --> 05:34:18,580
Are we getting that?

4986
05:34:18,580 --> 05:34:27,009
I got it.

4987
05:34:27,009 --> 05:34:27,509
Okay.

4988
05:34:33,889 --> 05:34:34,130
Sure.

4989
05:34:34,130 --> 05:34:34,630
Whatever you say.

4990
05:34:47,560 --> 05:34:48,439
No comedy gamble?

4991
05:34:56,290 --> 05:34:59,009
I still have to damage them?

4992
05:34:59,009 --> 05:35:00,689
Or what if I just stay alive permanently?

4993
05:35:00,689 --> 05:35:01,330
What if we just...

4994
05:35:01,330 --> 05:35:02,290
Let's go in the tower now.

4995
05:35:02,770 --> 05:35:05,009
Let's just take the tower right now.

4996
05:35:06,049 --> 05:35:07,889
Why would we not just take the tower right now?

4997
05:35:07,889 --> 05:35:09,729
Let's go.

4998
05:35:09,729 --> 05:35:10,369
Take the tower now.

4999
05:35:10,369 --> 05:35:10,869
Go.

5000
05:35:11,250 --> 05:35:18,200
All right.

5001
05:35:18,200 --> 05:35:19,799
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

5002
05:35:19,799 --> 05:35:20,299
We got it.

5003
05:35:20,840 --> 05:35:31,810
All right.

5004
05:35:31,810 --> 05:35:32,310
Everybody out.

5005
05:35:35,669 --> 05:35:37,500
Shit.

5006
05:35:38,040 --> 05:35:39,319
Oh, we're gonna lose.

5007
05:35:44,419 --> 05:35:44,919
I forgot...

5008
05:35:47,110 --> 05:35:51,830
I forgot that we all have a 60 second timer.

5009
05:36:03,119 --> 05:36:04,799
No, this doesn't count.

5010
05:36:04,799 --> 05:36:06,229
That doesn't count.

5011
05:36:06,790 --> 05:36:20,470
Are you gonna leave it alive?

5012
05:36:20,470 --> 05:36:21,349
Oh, you...

5013
05:36:21,349 --> 05:36:21,849
Okay.

5014
05:36:22,330 --> 05:36:26,569
They won't want to keep this going.

5015
05:36:26,569 --> 05:36:36,389
That's the biggest mistake they ever made.

5016
05:36:36,389 --> 05:36:37,349
That was a big mistake.

5017
05:36:49,500 --> 05:36:54,939
As long as we move as a party, we're gonna be fine.

5018
05:37:01,930 --> 05:37:03,290
Oh, excuse me.

5019
05:37:03,290 --> 05:37:04,009
What just happened?

5020
05:37:06,540 --> 05:37:09,419
Why did they all do the Warcraft 3 town portal?

5021
05:37:10,139 --> 05:37:10,639
What?

5022
05:37:15,930 --> 05:37:17,290
Since when is that in the game?

5023
05:37:28,119 --> 05:37:30,790
Horus's ult can do that.

5024
05:37:30,790 --> 05:37:31,430
Oh, no.

5025
05:37:41,880 --> 05:37:42,599
Oh, no.

5026
05:37:51,900 --> 05:37:52,860
It's still winnable?

5027
05:37:53,500 --> 05:37:54,000
Yeah, it is.

5028
05:37:59,360 --> 05:38:02,330
Our characters are way better for this composition.

5029
05:38:02,330 --> 05:38:06,490
We just need to not get teleported on.

5030
05:38:15,369 --> 05:38:16,250
Double mercy.

5031
05:38:21,840 --> 05:38:27,209
Well, there's no feeding because everyone's level 20 and has infinite gold.

5032
05:38:27,209 --> 05:38:28,009
There's no feeding.

5033
05:38:28,009 --> 05:38:30,169
It's just who has a better team comp at this point.

5034
05:38:30,169 --> 05:38:32,380
We just have to win one team fight.

5035
05:38:32,380 --> 05:38:34,270
We can do it.

5036
05:38:34,270 --> 05:38:44,520
Are they gonna do that again?

5037
05:38:44,520 --> 05:38:45,020
No.

5038
05:38:54,799 --> 05:38:55,299
All right.

5039
05:38:55,299 --> 05:38:55,759
No, no, no.

5040
05:38:55,759 --> 05:38:56,560
Look, he's got half health.

5041
05:38:59,150 --> 05:39:00,349
They're all waiting on the right side.

5042
05:39:00,349 --> 05:39:00,909
They're already...

5043
05:39:00,909 --> 05:39:01,790
Look, they're right here.

5044
05:39:04,000 --> 05:39:04,500
I...

5045
05:39:05,200 --> 05:39:09,479
Wait, how'd they get behind us?

5046
05:39:40,669 --> 05:39:41,169
Come here.

5047
05:39:41,950 --> 05:39:48,669
He's gonna jump around.

5048
05:39:48,669 --> 05:39:50,650
I'm gonna cut him off this way.

5049
05:39:50,650 --> 05:39:54,569
Fuck him.

5050
05:39:54,569 --> 05:39:54,810
Fuck him.

5051
05:39:54,810 --> 05:39:55,369
Just go to the tower.

5052
05:39:55,369 --> 05:39:55,869
Who cares?

5053
05:40:12,569 --> 05:40:13,069
Ah!

5054
05:40:14,569 --> 05:40:22,159
Oh, I thought that was high.

5055
05:40:22,799 --> 05:40:31,880
Remember, your viewer count retreated.

5056
05:40:31,880 --> 05:40:32,200
It's...

5057
05:40:32,200 --> 05:40:32,599
I don't...

5058
05:40:32,599 --> 05:40:33,159
It's fine.

5059
05:40:33,159 --> 05:40:35,259
I don't care.

5060
05:40:35,259 --> 05:40:35,900
I don't care.

5061
05:40:37,790 --> 05:40:40,669
I'm surprised that more than 5k people stuck around to watch

5062
05:40:41,229 --> 05:40:43,630
a fucking dingus play smite for five hours.

5063
05:40:44,270 --> 05:40:54,189
We got all five?

5064
05:41:02,090 --> 05:41:02,970
No, it's all good.

5065
05:41:03,930 --> 05:41:06,490
Look, I know a lot of people are not into these games.

5066
05:41:07,369 --> 05:41:08,090
It's fine.

5067
05:41:08,090 --> 05:41:08,490
It's cool.

5068
05:41:10,159 --> 05:41:11,200
I get it completely.

5069
05:41:11,200 --> 05:41:12,000
Don't worry.

5070
05:41:12,000 --> 05:41:21,849
We just need somebody to overextend for a second and we'll win the game.

5071
05:41:21,849 --> 05:41:23,450
One of them's gonna get super cocky.

5072
05:41:23,450 --> 05:41:24,250
They're gonna get up here.

5073
05:41:24,250 --> 05:41:25,610
They're gonna try to attack and run away.

5074
05:41:25,610 --> 05:41:27,130
We're gonna collapse on them.

5075
05:41:27,130 --> 05:41:34,250
Uh-oh.

5076
05:41:34,250 --> 05:41:35,770
Someone's getting a little cocky.

5077
05:41:36,409 --> 05:41:37,959
Getting a little bored.

5078
05:41:37,959 --> 05:41:38,919
Wants to make something happen.

5079
05:41:39,400 --> 05:41:45,369
There it is!

5080
05:41:45,369 --> 05:41:45,770
There it is!

5081
05:41:45,770 --> 05:41:46,090
There it is!

5082
05:41:46,090 --> 05:41:46,970
There it is!

5083
05:41:46,970 --> 05:41:47,790
Run away.

5084
05:41:47,790 --> 05:41:48,110
Never mind.

5085
05:41:48,110 --> 05:41:48,669
Run away.

5086
05:41:48,669 --> 05:41:49,310
Run away.

5087
05:41:49,310 --> 05:41:49,709
Never mind.

5088
05:42:09,549 --> 05:42:10,750
Oh my god.

5089
05:42:10,750 --> 05:42:11,470
What the hell?

5090
05:42:11,470 --> 05:42:13,389
Why do they all get Star Trek themed?

5091
05:42:24,060 --> 05:42:24,619
Oh god.

5092
05:42:25,340 --> 05:42:25,979
We're in trouble.

5093
05:42:57,119 --> 05:42:57,360
All right.

5094
05:42:57,360 --> 05:43:00,240
That's it.

5095
05:43:00,240 --> 05:43:01,119
That's it.

5096
05:43:01,119 --> 05:43:01,680
That was fun.

5097
05:43:02,599 --> 05:43:05,720
Except for when I played the one game of Conquest that was not fun.

5098
05:43:07,200 --> 05:43:08,159
It wasn't its own way.

5099
05:43:16,840 --> 05:43:18,200
That was uh smite.

5100
05:43:18,200 --> 05:43:20,479
It's a fun game.

5101
05:43:20,479 --> 05:43:23,119
I recommend you play it if you like those kinds of games.

5102
05:43:23,759 --> 05:43:27,880
That was smite Thursdays.

5103
05:43:27,880 --> 05:43:29,000
Next Thursday.

5104
05:43:29,000 --> 05:43:31,000
You're not gonna see this ever again.

5105
05:43:31,639 --> 05:43:39,049
We will only play smite again if I can get some more...

5106
05:43:39,049 --> 05:43:43,659
I was gonna say skins.

5107
05:43:44,619 --> 05:43:46,060
That's all that matters.

5108
05:43:49,200 --> 05:43:50,240
Maybe you'll see it again.

5109
05:43:50,240 --> 05:43:51,520
It's fun just to fuck around.

5110
05:43:52,080 --> 05:43:57,560
Join my game clan.

5111
05:43:57,560 --> 05:43:57,720
No.

5112
05:44:01,919 --> 05:44:02,560
That's gonna be it.

5113
05:44:05,369 --> 05:44:07,529
So I will see you guys on probably Monday or Tuesday.

5114
05:44:07,529 --> 05:44:09,049
Check the sus the next day or two.

5115
05:44:09,049 --> 05:44:12,540
We are gonna play...

5116
05:44:12,540 --> 05:44:13,500
What did I say we're gonna play?

5117
05:44:14,060 --> 05:44:14,860
Something really specific.

5118
05:44:14,860 --> 05:44:21,790
What was it?

5119
05:44:21,790 --> 05:44:22,509
GTA, right.

5120
05:44:22,509 --> 05:44:24,349
We'll play Grand Theft Auto online.

5121
05:44:24,349 --> 05:44:33,610
And then we're gonna prepare the...

5122
05:44:33,610 --> 05:44:36,169
We'll prepare some more public domain movie stuff for Halloween.

5123
05:44:36,169 --> 05:44:52,189
What about Paladins?

5124
05:44:52,189 --> 05:44:52,909
Eh, I don't think so.

5125
05:44:55,080 --> 05:44:55,400
But yeah.

5126
05:44:55,400 --> 05:44:57,720
I'll see you guys in three or four days or so.

5127
05:44:57,720 --> 05:45:00,139
See you soon.

5128
05:45:00,139 --> 05:45:03,400
Thanks for sticking around.

5129
05:45:03,400 --> 05:45:06,439
I know it's not one of those games that a lot of people really want to sit down and watch.

5130
05:45:06,439 --> 05:45:07,740
I know.

5131
05:45:07,740 --> 05:45:11,020
But I figured we'd play some viewer games and just hang out for four or five hours.

5132
05:45:11,020 --> 05:45:12,939
So that's exactly what we did.

5133
05:45:12,939 --> 05:45:17,400
See you in a few days.

5134
05:45:17,400 --> 05:45:18,520
Thanks for watching guys.

5135
05:45:18,520 --> 05:45:25,099
Take care of yourselves.

5136
05:45:25,099 --> 05:45:25,979
Always a pleasure.

5137
05:45:25,979 --> 05:45:35,479
Oh, I also got something else to tell you about too.

5138
05:45:35,479 --> 05:45:41,450
We are going to get incoming some new BloorDow music.

5139
05:45:41,450 --> 05:45:43,689
And some new emotes and animated emotes.

5140
05:45:43,689 --> 05:45:45,450
BloorDow's gonna make a bunch of stuff.

5141
05:45:45,450 --> 05:45:49,310
As you know, BloorDow has made all the music you've heard on this channel.

5142
05:45:49,310 --> 05:45:51,419
These original music.

5143
05:45:51,419 --> 05:45:52,560
We're gonna get some more tracks.

5144
05:45:53,119 --> 05:45:54,959
I'm incredibly excited for that.

5145
05:45:54,959 --> 05:45:59,209
Because it's very, very obvious.

5146
05:45:59,209 --> 05:46:00,090
I don't even need to state this.

5147
05:46:00,090 --> 05:46:01,450
BloorDow's music.

5148
05:46:01,450 --> 05:46:02,330
All of them bangers.

5149
05:46:02,330 --> 05:46:06,040
All of them.

5150
05:46:06,040 --> 05:46:07,159
New sub badges as well.

5151
05:46:07,159 --> 05:46:07,639
That's right.

5152
05:46:07,639 --> 05:46:19,020
You're a funny fellow.

5153
05:46:19,020 --> 05:46:25,529
Hey, thanks.

5154
05:46:25,529 --> 05:46:26,650
Not the dollhouse theme.

5155
05:46:26,650 --> 05:46:26,889
No.

5156
05:46:26,889 --> 05:46:29,369
That's the one thing the original song that BloorDow did not make.

5157
05:46:30,009 --> 05:46:32,889
But we're gonna get another probably two or three new tracks.

5158
05:46:32,889 --> 05:46:40,330
We're still working on what the sub badges are gonna be.

5159
05:46:40,330 --> 05:46:43,209
Because there's years worth of subs now.

5160
05:46:43,290 --> 05:46:48,000
How does it feel to be a soulless streamer?

5161
05:46:48,000 --> 05:46:48,500
What?

5162
05:46:50,250 --> 05:46:51,209
Am I soulless?

5163
05:46:51,209 --> 05:46:55,439
I hope none of you think that.

5164
05:46:55,439 --> 05:46:57,360
You really think I'm a soulless guy?

5165
05:46:57,360 --> 05:46:58,319
I hope not.

5166
05:46:58,319 --> 05:47:03,869
I think I have a soul.

5167
05:47:03,869 --> 05:47:04,669
I think so.

5168
05:47:04,669 --> 05:47:06,830
That's like the glowy thing that's in the middle of your chest, right?

5169
05:47:16,909 --> 05:47:18,840
Thanks for subbing as always.

5170
05:47:18,840 --> 05:47:20,380
Thanks everybody.

5171
05:47:20,380 --> 05:47:21,740
We'll see you in a few days.

5172
05:47:21,740 --> 05:47:22,619
Thanks for playing Smite.

5173
05:47:22,619 --> 05:47:23,580
Thanks for humoring me.

5174
05:47:23,580 --> 05:47:26,060
Because this is not something I typically will do on this channel.

5175
05:47:26,779 --> 05:47:31,369
Thanks for watching nonetheless.

5176
05:47:31,369 --> 05:48:50,409
We'll see you soon.
