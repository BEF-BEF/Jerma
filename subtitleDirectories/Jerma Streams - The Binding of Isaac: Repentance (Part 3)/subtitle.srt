1
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:22,100
Okay, um, so I gotta tell you, I'll be back in five more minutes.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,739
There is delicious food, and I need to eat it. I'll be right back.

3
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,469
I'm just gonna go eat something. I'll be back. Just give me like five minutes. Not even.

4
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:49,640
I'll be back in exactly four... eight... four... I'll be back at 420! Yeah! Perfect.

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:09:38,779
All right, be right back. I'll be back. Oh man, that was good.

6
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:49,909
Oh, so good. Late. Yeah. When you get into that mode where you're just eating... I was looking

7
00:09:49,909 --> 00:10:01,529
at the clock. It's like, it's been four hours and 20 minutes on the stream, but this next bite of

8
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:18,889
delicious fried rice is... that's all I'm thinking of right now. All right, settled down. All right,

9
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:37,220
let's do Isaac. I'm just gonna play one game of Isaac. We'll see. Oh, I need... I need my controller.

10
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:58,710
Oh, it's on the... hold on. It's in the other room. One more BRB. I promise I'm not gonna eat food.

11
00:10:59,830 --> 00:12:17,929
I do... I do like the, he hates streaming comments. All right, I got my tea refilled

12
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:51,980
because it's true. It's not true. Dear, slander me like that. Look, Isaac. I kind of... I want to

13
00:12:51,980 --> 00:13:10,730
play greed mode. What is... What is this? Easter eggs. Look at how good I am at this game, by the

14
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:21,820
way. I just love playing as Samson in greed mode. It's just... that just is the way it's gonna work

15
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:36,470
here. All right, it's been a little while. I have the mod still, right? Yep. One bone heart. Should

16
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:51,139
I pick that up? Wait, what is this? Oh, he cheated. I forgot. It's a bad item. Well, I want to take

17
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:59,419
hits with Samson, so... By the way, I'm gonna have wicked bad food voice. One of the reasons I don't

18
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:04,700
like to eat before streaming. I know it's probably other streamers that have this mentality as well,

19
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,899
but when you eat and then it's time to talk for four or five straight hours...

20
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:26,090
No, that's one of the reasons why I don't really eat a lot before streaming. Yeah, you get that

21
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:39,669
really bad milk voice. All right, just give me... Yeah, hit me. I need to do more damage than this.

22
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:54,789
Bullshit. Dude, I got S++ today. I'm very proud of myself. Can I just tell you?

23
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:11,129
I killed 150 enemies in a row. Like, I got an A for the first time on my report card. I am sprinting

24
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:29,100
home to show mom. All right, that's all the hits I want to take. It's almost like a look, look, see,

25
00:15:29,100 --> 00:16:01,259
see, see, ma, look. I forgot this is greedier. It's harder. I thought I died. It's a heal.

26
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:20,230
Hmm. Play Tainted Samson instead. I like the regular Samson based.

27
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,000
Mimics Isaac's movement on a 0.66 delay. Deals 30 con... Ah, this thing...

28
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:40,629
This thing kind of stinks, doesn't it? Just restart. I don't think you need to do that.

29
00:16:43,269 --> 00:17:19,369
It's fine. It's probably actually not bad here in greed mode. Hey, what does this guy look like?

30
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:59,779
Um, and um, Tingle. Yeah, you know that guy Tingle from Zelda? Spitting image. He's definitely

31
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:06,019
naked. Uh, that would be kind of weird to eat. Oh, hold on a minute. I got a food voice.

32
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,759
I don't know if I'd want to eat food naked. That would kind of be annoying. I don't... I would not

33
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:35,380
like that. That would suck. Uh, I don't have enough hearts to get this. You've never done it.

34
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:54,819
I don't think so. Should I get the key? Sharp key. Because if you think about it,

35
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:59,720
that's a deal. That's five, 10, 15, 20, 25. That's 25 cents worth of keys.

36
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:15,099
But now I don't have to worry about keys anymore. Just don't throw them. No bombs either. What the

37
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:22,940
hell is that? Modeling clay? Ooh, I like that. There's a 50% chance to grant the effect of a

38
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:44,900
random passive item each room. That's kind of good. I'll try it. I guess I'm going to do more clay

39
00:19:44,900 --> 00:20:01,450
stuff. I told you guys that I started doing it, right? It's not something that I don't plan on

40
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:09,980
doing it on. Oh my God. More keys. I don't plan on doing it on stream or anything. It's like a

41
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:27,369
little hobby. This is not bad here. Hmm. There's a key. This is a really bad idea. I don't think I'm

42
00:20:27,369 --> 00:21:03,210
going to do it. King baby. I set a PhD. All right, let's get hurt. Come on. Keep hitting. Hit me

43
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:20,579
again. One more time. Not from a champion. From a regular enemy, please. Back off. I didn't even do

44
00:21:20,579 --> 00:22:20,009
it right. What? Hit me. What? What was that? That run sucked. That build was awful. Yeah. What does

45
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:43,559
a s'more do? It's over. You failed. Finally. Finally. Let me do it. God damn it. I'm so fucking mad

46
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:55,460
right now. I kept talking over it. I was talking over it. I was like, finally I get to do the pitch

47
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,079
down echo reverb sneeze joke that I've been waiting like a month to do. And I talked over it

48
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:21,609
while it came up. That's so irritating to me. That's so, I'm actually mad about that. Somebody

49
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:55,660
just wrote bless you with a bunch of question marks. I'm going to die again. Hold on. I don't

50
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,740
even know why I care about it too. I'm just like, yo, next time I sneeze, maybe I'll just turn on my

51
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:15,940
filters. It'd be super funny. I bet you so many people are going to go. All right. This is the one.

52
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:29,339
We're going to, I'll get a bunch of dog shit items. There we go. Run is officially on. I hope you're

53
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:47,109
ready. I just need a shit load of tears up and we're good. Strength, arrow cod. Nice. Brain worm.

54
00:24:47,670 --> 00:26:07,140
Just don't screw this up. I need tears up so bad. This is low. All right. We're good. This could be

55
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:15,319
a destructive run as long as I don't totally blow it. Then I'll be fine. Get tears up on a damage

56
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:42,680
brain worm increased tier size. It's available. I didn't even see this guy. All right. This is range

57
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:56,920
brain worm for sure. I'm personally begging you to buy brain worm. Oh yeah. I wasn't going to miss

58
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:45,980
that guys. How personally invested are you in this run? Keep it going. This could be the one. I don't

59
00:27:45,980 --> 00:28:03,029
know how you're going to bet on it, but oh, by the way, I'm thinking of a crazy idea for channel

60
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:09,579
points. I just have to make sure I can do it. So all you channel point Andes that have been asking

61
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:20,299
about it for a long time now, I might have something cooking here and it's pretty sick.

62
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:27,319
I'm just telling you, I got to, I might have a really disappointing news when I tell you like,

63
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:45,640
oh, nevermind. I can't do it. What's this? Wait, what? Ma of the void. Will this replace my big

64
00:28:45,640 --> 00:29:03,259
charge tears? Take it. I only have one heart. Use the card then buy it. Use the card for a free heart.

65
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:22,900
Don't take it. I think this one, I'd rather have this one. I made my decision to damage up, right?

66
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:36,440
Did it even do two damage up? Now take it. Card. What? The card. Wait, what? Everyone's yelling at

67
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,269
me. You're a dumb ass. What? I didn't, what did I do wrong? I didn't want this thing. I didn't want

68
00:29:43,269 --> 00:30:02,619
it. It's an active item. I didn't want that thing. At least I get my 3d glasses. I want a bomb. I

69
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:40,279
don't care. I'm doing it. Nice. Let's get out of here. How come I, why did I vote? Yes. You're

70
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:56,170
going to be fine. All right. So I want to, I want to run over this shit. Nice. Nice. Take that up

71
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:17,849
here. Nice. Uh, my brain worm has to go away though. That's worth it. All right. And now I

72
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:41,579
want to blow this up. I think I'm going to keep the brain worm. Tinted? What do you mean? Where,

73
00:31:41,579 --> 00:32:01,859
where, where? Sick. Penny is a free win. Yeah. Let's go for it. I want money. It's all about

74
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:23,099
the money for me right now. I'm taking it. Yeah. This is great mode. Aim up, aim up. Whatever that

75
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:32,309
is. Double tapping a fire button makes Isaac sneeze blood. Sneeze deals 150% damage. Really?

76
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:47,910
That's not going to mess with my thing. Is it? Cool. It doesn't. So I can be like, boom.

77
00:32:51,430 --> 00:33:06,329
Here's up. Yes. The play is to go. Let go pop. Let go pop. Randomly grants the effect of none

78
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:39,529
of this matters. Right? What does this question mark for? Why is there a question mark up there?

79
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:47,140
In the top left is a red question mark that appears. Why? All right. Let's start it.

80
00:33:47,140 --> 00:34:02,789
The pill is behind the spikes. It's an unknown pill. Right? All right. Let's go. I like the sound

81
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:31,099
it makes. Does this count as a brimstone or no? Just a charge move. I gotta take some hits.

82
00:34:31,099 --> 00:35:31,019
The money to damage. Ow. Oh, nice. I'm okay. Taking the hits. This stinks. What? My character?

83
00:35:31,019 --> 00:36:01,829
What do you think? I just, I just killed them all. Oh, it's only two tiers from monstros lungs.

84
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:25,500
Many tears. Oh, what was that by the car battery? Yeah. What the hell? What about the devil room?

85
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:51,269
I didn't want it. Okay. Let's get out of here. We're doing good. You had enough health. I'm,

86
00:36:51,269 --> 00:37:11,460
I don't want to throw any more hearts away. Huge. Although do I want the damage?

87
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:21,659
That's a lot of damage to lose. Is it worth it? I guess it's DPS for versus straight up damage.

88
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:54,969
Right? It's probably better. He's better be good. Fuck you. Monstros lung is all about high damage.

89
00:37:54,969 --> 00:38:15,500
You just fucked up. What do you know? Probably a lot. Actually not even the worst thing that

90
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:24,570
could have happened. Come on. Give me something. Yes. Empty heart grants a heart container when it

91
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:40,469
went at one red heart or less at the start of a new floor. Why can I pick this up? I have to

92
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:59,460
bomb it. Oh, I've never seen that before. I just ran over that like an idiot. Range D eight

93
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:13,190
multiplies Isaac's damage tiers, range and speed. He's faking it. No, I was reading chat.

94
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:36,679
I'm going to blow through this whole level. Just watch. Oh my God. Disgusting. No one even

95
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:58,329
touched me. I did that on purpose. I felt bad. What even? I honestly don't even know what keeps

96
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:53,719
hitting me. I don't even want any of this stuff. Too much to give up. Seven seals. I don't know.

97
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:07,500
I only have four hearts. It's not worth it. Look at the money I have. All right. I'm thinking about

98
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:27,829
a reroll. Oh, I definitely want this. Maybe the I want the range. This thing is not going far at

99
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:50,139
all. I like being able to just throw it like across the room like this. Oh, hell nah. He went for

100
00:41:50,139 --> 00:42:02,789
range. What? What we have? Oh, I like range. I like being able to hit things from far away.

101
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:24,119
Take some damage for a free heart container. I'll do that on the next. Look at all these doubters.

102
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:43,019
Everybody was just saying, why did you do that? Why did you activate the nail in here? I don't

103
00:42:43,019 --> 00:43:05,800
know. Maybe because I could get fucking double this doubled. Yeah. Right now everyone's on the

104
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:14,739
phone trying to figure out how to refund a betting channel points because they just saw what I just

105
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:27,559
got. And that's tech point five. Occasionally fire lasers in addition to Isaac's tears. Okay.

106
00:43:27,559 --> 00:44:06,199
Sounds great. Let's replace this. I can't lose now. Not possible. All right. I'll do it again.

107
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:17,610
Manny pack. Yep. Oh, only applies to the right eye, but these are coming out of my mouth.

108
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:38,250
Cause I didn't do anything. Yeah. I need to save money. That's true. We're going to get to 49 or

109
00:44:38,250 --> 00:45:21,539
50 coins. All right. I need, I need to get hurt. Why are you, what do you mean? Why are you collecting

110
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:35,659
the coins? The two of diamonds is just doubles your coins. I don't think they have to be in the

111
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:47,820
ground. What about the sneeze? The sneeze doesn't really do anything. Why are you reading chat?

112
00:45:47,820 --> 00:47:13,590
Because I'm a live streamer. Mom walked in. Yeah. Fuck you. Yeah. Mom. I'm just showing,

113
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:35,159
just hanging out with friends. Yeah. I'm okay. Yeah. I'm going to get it done. Five more minutes.

114
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:46,730
Yeah. Okay. So I, I'm just going to use it now. Stop leaving the room. You just unsubscribed.

115
00:47:46,730 --> 00:48:18,980
Um, let's take the diamonds now and whatever. I'm going to shopping spree buddy in a box. Nice.

116
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:48,570
Nice. Cano. I didn't see what it did. What it does for Kano old tab to see what it does.

117
00:48:48,570 --> 00:49:04,969
Drop it. It's the right trigger to drop everything. Right. Okay. So I was three blue spiders and three

118
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:52,630
blue flies. Oh, okay. That's cool. Godlike run. That technology thing is awesome. Save money,

119
00:49:52,630 --> 00:50:14,900
save money, save money. Oh no, it's crumples. I think I'd rather have the two damage and that's

120
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:47,530
it. The nail is just two free damage. Almost there. Yes. What the fuck isn't chocolate milk?

121
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:58,659
Won't that override? No, I don't want that. That's going to override everything. This definitely

122
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:07,820
doesn't stack. Oh, I see. A lot of you guys are going to lose a lot of channel points if I

123
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:29,699
don't take that. I see. That's why a lot of you're saying it. We literally believe there's no way

124
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:35,510
this guy's serious. Wait, is that for real? You'll never know if it's stacks or not. If you don't

125
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:52,699
take it. What? Uh, please take it. I beg of you. Does anybody actually know if it stacks?

126
00:51:52,699 --> 00:52:03,780
I'm terrified to actually touch this. Ask chat GPT. Hey chat GPT does, um, chocolate milk

127
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:25,739
and monstros tooth. I'm not picking it up. I don't want to touch it. I'll look it up. Does

128
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:41,059
monstros tooth and chocolate milk stack? Yeah. Monstros lung. Sorry. It's monstros lung and

129
00:52:41,059 --> 00:53:03,699
chocolate milk stack. It does. Holy shit, dude. Are you serious? That's this 400% more. I thought

130
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:28,039
you guys were just fucking with me. All right, let's do it. I can't see. There's so much saliva

131
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:43,210
in my mouth. What? Why does so much saliva in my mouth? What happened? I don't know where that

132
00:53:43,210 --> 00:54:09,900
came from. That was weird. Nice. Okay. You got plenty of hearts of Isaac, chocolate milk and

133
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,820
monstros lung do synergize with each other. When these two items are combined, the player can

134
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,940
charge up monstros lung more quickly by repeatedly tapping the shoot button, which causes Isaac to

135
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,500
shoot a barrage of tears in a short amount of time. This results in a very powerful attack.

136
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,500
It can do a lot of damage to enemies. Additionally, the charge shots from monstros lung

137
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:39,900
are affected by chocolate milk damage multiplier, which can. What's going on? Chat. GPT is say that.

138
00:54:41,369 --> 00:55:06,860
Why did I leave the room? Tap. Don't hold your chat. GPT told me to tap and it's, it's more

139
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:23,690
effective. I don't fucking like this computer shit. I don't like the computers to do this.

140
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:28,869
I don't like the computers can tell us this. I don't like computers. I don't, I don't, I don't

141
00:55:28,869 --> 00:56:13,989
like computers anymore. Here comes the Amish rant. Ooh, it's poop moving. I don't like that.

142
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:41,000
Hmm. Is that worth taking that? I would know the one duplicates a random pickup in the room.

143
00:56:41,000 --> 00:57:04,940
Thanks. Thanks. I don't care if I get hurt. Gigachad. Nice. Is that, wait, is that tears up

144
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:48,070
again? Re-roll it. Hmm. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Metronome. Uh-huh. Holy shit. Oh, I'm at the

145
00:57:48,070 --> 00:58:24,380
tear cap. Should I get this bomb? The reroll machine. Okay. Let's go get it with the battery

146
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:33,829
max two per room. No, I think I'm just going to go for it. Only one more floor. Anyways.

147
00:58:33,829 --> 00:59:09,159
Ooh. Guppy's tail as well. Throwing poop spawns one blue fly. I'm already at the. Oh yeah.

148
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:30,059
Ace of clubs turns all pickups, chess and non-boss items into bombs. Tower. This one's a super one.

149
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:41,849
The devil to whatever it is. Activates the Bible grants seraphim grants flight last for 30 seconds.

150
00:59:41,849 --> 01:00:41,289
All right. I remember that's there. Where's this office still live? Oh, it's this guy.

151
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:53,849
I want full like end game legend of Zelda heart road. I don't want this. That's not enough for

152
01:00:53,849 --> 01:01:47,940
Omega greed. Jesus. Where the hell are you? I'm pretty confident. We're sending so many offerings

153
01:01:47,940 --> 01:02:06,539
to summon you into your Roblox world right now. I don't think I can make it. Holy shit. Twisted

154
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:21,719
pair by twisted pair. Holy shit. OP, OP, OP, OP. Huh? Wait, are we all doing the same move?

155
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:55,099
I need hearts though. This is bad. Hearts for sale. No, I need, I mean like max HP by more upside

156
01:02:55,099 --> 01:03:02,539
down cards, stars, the devil again. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I'm overwhelming myself.

157
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:23,179
Removes Isaac's oldest passive item. All right. Wait, it doesn't order. I got to do this then.

158
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:33,050
What did I, what did I just do? I'm fine. I think it's just the devil use stars right now.

159
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:44,420
What did I just get? Your oldest passive item was the key item. Really don't use it. Wait,

160
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:51,449
people are saying don't do it. All right. Uh, no, I got the devil. I'm ready to go take on greed.

161
01:03:51,449 --> 01:04:03,639
Do not use it. Don't use it. Don't use it. All right. Doubters are telling you not to do it.

162
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:27,849
It really, wait, my oldest item is the nail, not the key. How that works. Nails, not passive. Oh,

163
01:04:27,849 --> 01:04:49,400
what's the first passive item? Oldest passive item, ignoring starter items. Blood lust is the

164
01:04:49,400 --> 01:05:25,050
oldest. He doesn't do anything and doors box. What is it? What does it do? This thing's OP.

165
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:30,179
Single use spawns rewards based on floor. What floor am I technically on for greed?

166
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:44,980
It's a chest. One coin. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Give me the devil card. Let's go.

167
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:53,829
I'm ready. I'm not messing around. All right, everybody. This is it. We'll see. Let's see how

168
01:05:53,829 --> 01:06:34,630
you voted. All right. This is kind of, I could blow it though. Uh, I think we're gonna be fine.

169
01:06:34,630 --> 01:07:18,860
I'm a little slow, but it's all right. Holy shit. A coupon. What? Who cares? What? What?

170
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:29,989
Okay. Slow down. Slow down. What am I doing? I don't care about that. I should have gotten that

171
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:48,710
excited. Yeah. This is, this is for free. Sorry, doubters. No refunds right now. I apologize.

172
01:07:48,710 --> 01:08:26,010
This is the way it is. All right. Should I, for a joke, should I take myself down to half a heart

173
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:30,329
to give the doubters a little bit of a, you know, just so they don't all leave at the same time?

174
01:08:40,550 --> 01:09:08,310
Oh, nevermind. Cool. That was a good one. Don't patronize me. Chat carried you. I mean chat helped

175
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:16,699
make decisions. Of course they did. I don't know. I feel like you can't play Isaac and like there's

176
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:21,020
somebody, unless there's somebody sitting next to you telling you what items you should get.

177
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:32,489
And honestly, I do that for other people. I feel like I'm so confused half the time that I play

178
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:38,649
Isaac, but if I'm watching somebody play Isaac, they're getting a ton of advice. I'm telling them

179
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:43,529
everything. Oh, tainted rock over there. Uh, check the secret room, secret top right room,

180
01:09:43,529 --> 01:10:08,659
probably secret room. So, yeah, it's a very backseat game. Advice from you. Nobody can't

181
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:17,430
know a thing or two about Isaac. Uh, he must've just joined the stream. Top left. So we'll make

182
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:26,869
sure you see all a hundred percent of the game. Well, somebody else did. And then I installed it

183
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:38,500
on my computer, but it's on my machine. So technically I own it. All right. That's going

184
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:44,069
to be it. I'll see you guys later. I might stream this weekend. I told you I wanted to do

185
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:52,710
old ads. That's possible. I would say if not Sunday, then maybe Monday. There's a couple of

186
01:10:52,710 --> 01:11:02,460
things I really want to get situated before I stream again. Yeah, this is fun. Just jump around

187
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:20,600
playing games, slow it down, chill it out a little bit. Hope you had a good time. It's a good way to

188
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:36,460
wake up. Yeah. Some of you probably are just getting up. Yeah. Keep an eye out. I'll let you know.

189
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:48,729
That's the plan though. We'll go back to Breath of the Wild as well. Not immediately, but obviously

190
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:54,010
after we do some of this watch stuff and just some React Andy this weekend or into early this

191
01:11:54,010 --> 01:12:13,260
coming week. What about the new Hollow Knight? Maybe. What time this weekend? Uh, it's usually

192
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:27,979
6 PM Pacific in the more recent months. Let me get the right music on. This is not the correct music.

193
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:51,060
Where is that? Where's the music? Where's the music? Actually, I moved it to a different folder.

194
01:12:51,060 --> 01:13:21,189
Where the hell is it? There it is. See you guys soon. It's been 219 days since your last sorcery

195
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:41,880
stream. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get to it. I promise. Just can't give you a day. We'll see. Take care

196
01:13:41,880 --> 01:15:34,699
of yourselves. Call your mother. Have a good start to your weekend. See you very soon. Take it easy.
