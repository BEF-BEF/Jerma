1
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:35,060
Wait, hello there. How are you? Happy Father's Day to all the fathers.

2
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:46,520
Let's just get that right out of the way. Happy Father's Day. Happy Father's Day.

3
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:59,750
Well, I'm a dog, Dad. Oh, thank you. Hope you're doing good. Welcome.

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Said today or tomorrow we were going to stream and well, I was going to stream.

5
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,099
It was going to be either Sunday or Monday and it turned out to be Sunday.

6
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,819
We are going to play for a few hours. I'm just going to probably play for,

7
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:29,000
we'll see. We'll see. This game is called only up. The game is impossible.

8
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,099
I don't, there's not, there hasn't been one person that's played this game that's gotten past the

9
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:39,299
halfway point. At least that's what I had a dream about. So I just figured it was true.

10
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:53,750
Did Lud beat it? Did Ludwig beat it? Well, yeah, but he's a gamer. Ludwig is a gamer.

11
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:04,120
Lud crushed it. Squeaks beat it too. Well, who didn't beat it? What streamer didn't beat it

12
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,490
and rage quit it in an hour. It's like, what category can I be in? Like who rage quitted

13
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:20,729
in like an hour and a half? You. Am I going to be the only one? It's just going to be me.

14
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,560
Well, whatever. I beat Jump King, the base game. So that's fine.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,409
XQC alt F board. I'll probably do that too. Honestly, I bet that happens here too.

16
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,060
Although I don't think I'll alt F4. I will just stop moving

17
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,539
and complain about the game for like 25 minutes in the end stream.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:05,099
You have to restart entirely if you close the game. Wait, does it? Well, don't spoil it for me.

19
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:12,460
I don't, I don't, I haven't seen anything. We're going to do face cam today. Yeah,

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,430
sure. If you're good, I'll make my assessment if you're good or not.

21
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:27,500
And if you're good, I'll turn it on for exactly 15 minutes. Why is this moving?

22
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,419
Hold on. This is something's not right here. Hold on. This shouldn't be moving.

23
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:58,490
Can't hear me, but I'll explain in a minute. Over here. Heck. What the heck?

24
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,050
I tried to plug a controller in. This game does not support controllers and I got immediately sad.

25
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,610
I was like, oh shit, I have to do keyboard and mouse. This is going to end very poorly.

26
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,649
So the thing that my chair sits on is it's on to make it so I don't ruin the carpet in the room.

27
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,300
It's sitting on top of this like wooden thing and the wooden thing was touching the desk and

28
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:37,800
the desk is touching the mic. So the mic was shaking. Are you guys ready? Let's go.

29
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:48,699
This is only up. We're going to start with no face cam. No face cam begin. There's one thing

30
00:04:48,699 --> 00:05:00,139
that I want to talk about very quickly. Grotto beasts. The starter kit for grotto beasts has

31
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:07,930
fallen under 10% availability. We are under 10% stock remaining on the kits. The packs,

32
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,600
there are a lot of them. There's a lot of them. But the packs we did a reprint on,

33
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:25,100
the starter kit is not getting a reprint. Kit is not getting a reprint. If you care,

34
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,579
you care. If you don't, then let's play only up. But I did say that I was going to tell people

35
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:39,910
that when it became a thing. I want to make sure people knew that. Also important, the kits,

36
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,060
the packs that are in the kits have print one boosters in them. They always will be print one

37
00:05:47,060 --> 00:06:00,389
because we're not doing a second print. When he said, no, I'm good. Okay. I did, I said I was

38
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:06,779
going to, when we got under 10% of the remaining stock, I said I was going to bring it up and I'll

39
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,779
probably bring it up again when we go kind of under 5% because I know people were waiting.

40
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,949
It's not a, it's not an inexpensive item. I know some people were saving up and they were like,

41
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,629
Hey, can I, is this still going to be available in a few months? And I was like, let's find out.

42
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:24,459
Turn the face cam on. You'll get it if you're, and that's not being good.

43
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:29,990
You're already proving that you're not being good today. Okay. I guess there will be no face cam

44
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:39,540
then. All right. This game's probably going to be pretty easy. Oh, don't look up. We need to get to

45
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,540
the top, the top of that. Sure. We'll make it. I wonder what awaits us there. The unknown is

46
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:55,180
frightening. All right. This is going to be a scenario where you wait 15 minutes, like Far Cry

47
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:12,230
four. There's an elevator that like spawns. Just watch. All right. Only go up. Do I need to know

48
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:23,910
anything? Elevator. What? Actual elevator, actual elevator. What? This is, I did not pre-play this.

49
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:34,389
I swear to God, I promise you I didn't. What? Is this actually in the game? How do I use it?

50
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:47,370
I did not pre-play this. I promise you. How do I activate it? Go up, go up. I don't think that's

51
00:07:47,370 --> 00:08:10,579
going to work. Should I start here? How do you go up? How do you play the game? Oh, okay. Slow

52
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:19,319
walking, slow motion is hold right mouse, sprint is shift, jump is space, crouch, camera, first person.

53
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:33,580
Okay. Well, how do I play? Can I hold that forever? Secret elevator bug fix. I've already managed to

54
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,740
use the secret elevator and get to the very top. What? Why did I not play this three days ago?

55
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:52,649
I could have just ended stream in 10 minutes. All right. I see I can go up here. Like only up,

56
00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:08,570
right? Is there a starting point? Where do we go? Press one. All right. When they do the streamer

57
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:15,429
breakdown of how high every streamer got off the ground, I'm going to be at like four meters. This

58
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:31,059
is not good already. All right. I got it. What are you playing? What the fuck is a meter?

59
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:45,379
Must be American. You're finally playing Tears of the Kingdom. What you forgot to say was,

60
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:56,200
you could be playing Tears of the Kingdom instead of this, right? Whatever. Dude, you could be playing

61
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:05,610
Tears of the Kingdom. I also could eat a BLT on stream. That promise is fucking gone. All right,

62
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:16,710
let's just go. Do you automatically grab onto edges? What the fuck is going on?

63
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:44,700
What? Why is it? Is this a distraction? They play distractions. All right, dude,

64
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:57,860
they play distractions at you. There we go. I'm already almost halfway through the game.

65
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:12,169
I'm doing good. Stop. Does everybody else game do this? I mean, hurry up.

66
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:26,419
You can always repeat your mistakes and learn from my mistakes. This is fucking me up so bad.

67
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:37,669
How do I get up? Turn. I got to turn. I'm turning the music off because this is,

68
00:11:44,950 --> 00:12:02,440
why can't I still hear it? We'll just go away if I get high enough.

69
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:13,289
Can we get away from the person practicing the song? I mean, if you're practicing songs,

70
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:23,100
wait, what's this thing? Check that out. Yeah. Just keep going. Keep going.

71
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,769
Why is it repeating every sound? Just turn it off and put on your own music. I just turned it

72
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:45,450
all the way down and it didn't work. Just restart. I don't want to, I don't do this all over again.

73
00:12:45,450 --> 00:13:01,620
Fucking whatever. Like what the fuck? All joke number one. No, I'm trying to reset the game so

74
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:24,200
I don't get the... Okay, turn it back up now. That was easy to get to that point.

75
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,899
Is he going to have a meltdown? No, I just, I don't want to get too far in the game and have

76
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:41,210
it actually be, I can't turn that off. Where the hell did I even start from?

77
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:52,940
You got one guide? Did I? Was that one guy? What do you mean yes? That shit happens to everybody?

78
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:03,940
Is that actually part of the game? What? No, you guys are full of shit. There's no way that's part

79
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:23,110
of the game. It's definitely a bug. See, it would have started by now. I think I'm in the clear.

80
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:52,779
It started right here. I don't hear anything. It hasn't repeated. Oh god damn it. Why?

81
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:21,960
Why? Is that seriously part of the game? It can't be. I don't make mistakes. Okay,

82
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:29,850
there's a lot of god rays in this game. The worst possible time to climb a gigantic structure with

83
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:41,299
no harness is absolutely when the god rays are in your fucking face, dude.

84
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:49,179
Do you go in one of these pipes? It's very hard to make a choice when you don't know where it will

85
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:09,940
lead. That's so high. I'm gonna go, all right, I'm gonna go left. This is, okay, I cannot look

86
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:20,309
over a chat. I can't look over a chat. If I look over a chat, I'll fall down. I'm gonna go very

87
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:33,500
slow. I'm gonna take it very calmly. What the fuck did I do that for? I'm fine. I was supposed to

88
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:45,610
go this way anyways. They definitely wanted you to go middle. Wait, I can walk. I forgot about

89
00:16:45,610 --> 00:17:08,390
walking. All right, where am I? Geez. Okay, get some sunglasses. What the fuck? I can't see

90
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:32,359
anything. I'm gonna go up here. God is calling you. All right, I'm going that way. Wow. I forgot.

91
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:46,819
You don't have to hold it. You just click once. Be very gentle. Okay. Oh my god. I forgot to run.

92
00:17:46,819 --> 00:18:03,450
He's doing the same walk that you did in the Christmas stream. Now, you're referring to the

93
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:19,160
sounds. They're like fucking dress shoe Andy. Oh, that's so stupid. I'm just gonna look down.

94
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:40,150
Stop reading chat. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so bad. I'm doing all right. Where do I go from here?

95
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:59,480
I don't have to jump from here, do I? Oh shit. Down here? I mean, how do I get up to that?

96
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:22,200
Go up. Yeah. Where's the correct up? Down there. Fuck it. I don't care. Sometimes you gotta take a

97
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:46,789
risk. I think it actually put me in a better position. I gotta turn the volume up now.

98
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:55,049
Can you guys hear it now? Or if I walk forward, will I just grow? Oh, there we go. Yep.

99
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:13,539
No, you have to jump. Okay. Wait, what about here? Um, I think I'm going the right way.

100
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:20,500
Look down, but go up. That's the strategy. Yeah. Look, I got myself in a much better position.

101
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:29,779
Oh dear. Okay. This is a big deal. Don't even think about it. Just do it. How? I guess I couldn't make

102
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:45,160
it. That the perspective was, the perspective was weird. I thought, so what was the point of that?

103
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:55,849
Is that just full of shit? Can I not actually go that way? What? Oh, come on. It's all right. I'll

104
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,490
get back up there in one second. Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid.

105
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:11,380
You can always repeat. We learn from our mistakes. And he said, God, I hate this game. I'm all right

106
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:19,660
right now. I'll get back up there in no time. So there's no checkpoints. So if I beat this game

107
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,599
with no checkpoints and when they add checkpoints after a bunch of people complain, I get an accolade,

108
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:40,900
right? You're never going to beat this. You have to beat it first though. Hey, I beat pre-patch

109
00:21:40,900 --> 00:22:06,119
Radan. I think I can beat pre-patch only up. Wait, I didn't go this way last time. Maybe I

110
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:24,970
just shouldn't even go that way. Can I go up this way? No! Okay, I'm fine. Yeah, I just see somebody

111
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:35,400
bobbing their head with a guitar pick. Just nodding around. You know what I mean? All right,

112
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,460
here we go. Back to, back where we were before. All right, let me get a good, how do I do first

113
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:50,150
person? Because that was obviously wrong. So let me figure it out. First person. How do I do it? C?

114
00:22:50,789 --> 00:23:04,250
Is it binoculars? I can play the game in first person. No, that's a bad idea. That's actually a

115
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:16,410
terrible idea. Okay, that top right up there is wrong. Maybe I need to go right. I'm going to try

116
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:27,769
going right. We've been good. Can we have the face game for 15 minutes? Yeah, yeah, you've been good.

117
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:43,900
Yeah, you've been good. You get it. Okay, when are you going to do the Peewee Herman dance?

118
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:55,380
When there's an opportunity to do a Peewee Herman dance and that's not right now.

119
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:40,250
All right, straight ahead. How the fuck do you do this? I'm just gonna go this way. Uh, smart.

120
00:24:40,250 --> 00:25:06,519
Smart. All right, walk. Do not run. Dude, this game is so bad. People just want to like freak out

121
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:14,039
and move their mouse around. You know what I mean? Sometimes I just want to just move my mouse fast.

122
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,700
It's just like, this is bad for me. You know what I mean? It's how many of you guys just kind of sit

123
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:28,039
there and just go like move your mouse just wildly for half a second sometimes. I probably

124
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:34,710
should turn the sensitivity down too. You said you'd do the dance next time you were on cam with

125
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:45,509
any music playing. I can't do the tequila Peewee Herman dance to that guitar riff.

126
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:58,220
Why am I not turning the right way? You see, that was weird. I didn't like that. All right,

127
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:11,500
so look, what the hell? Let me get a better look. So this is too far. What about down a little? No,

128
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:22,009
I can't, I cannot go this way. Can I jump up and grab the edge here? Wait, can I jump up and grab

129
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:51,460
the edge? Dude, all right. I, you gotta use logic. That doesn't do anything for me. Wait, I need to

130
00:26:51,460 --> 00:27:02,980
get on that one there. Whoa, that was way too far, way too far. Well, all right, I'll do it.

131
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:15,059
No, I'm just kidding. How does, how, I didn't know how far the jump went. I just did a full sprint

132
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,779
jump. I didn't, I can't, I'm not doing it. This is not, this is not Peewee Herman music.

133
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,420
This is not Peewee Herman dance music. This is not Peewee Herman dance music. I'm not doing it.

134
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,079
Shit. All right. Well, I had, that's what I, it's just one. Sometimes it's hard to choose the right

135
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:45,849
path, but don't be afraid. God damn it. No, go on the elevator. The elevator doesn't work. Do the

136
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:55,369
lion pose at least. No, is this, what is this 2017? What do you mean do the lion pose? Is this like

137
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:13,750
2018? Do the lion pose. All right. I'm going to get up there really quick. I get it now. So I wonder

138
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,630
if it's a full regular run jump and not a sprint jump. I just, I don't know. I don't know what the

139
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,950
trajectory, I don't know what the, the physics are. I don't know how far you go with a full jump. I

140
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,230
don't know how short you go with a small jump. This is all things I have to figure out over the

141
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:45,700
next 20 minutes before I all F4 and take like three months off. What the fuck just happened?

142
00:28:46,259 --> 00:29:01,000
Okay. My boogers almost just flew out of my nose because people want me to do the Peewee Herman

143
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,789
dance. It's hard to choose the right path. Don't be afraid. You can always repeat. We learn from

144
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:19,750
our mistakes. All right. I got to get to where I just was. Good luck. Okay. How do I get over there?

145
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:42,619
That works too. Jerma's Peewee Herman promise. No, this is not the way you think. This is not,

146
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:59,259
this is the wrong, this is the wrong tune. Okay. This is the wrong tune. All right. I'm here. I'm

147
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:05,740
actually here. I actually made it. I made it. Look. All right. Burn this into long-term memory.

148
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:15,380
Where did I go? That was right up the middle. That was right up the middle and I don't remember.

149
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,619
Just don't lose. It's okay. I just don't fall off. I don't win. Is there a crouch or anything?

150
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:34,900
Because this is freaking me out. Oh God. Wait. Is this bait? I don't know what this does.

151
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:51,460
That's bait. That doesn't mean it. Wait. Is this a checkpoint? Does this do anything?

152
00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:05,480
I think it's just a place to just sit for a minute and take a drink of water. Oh, that was

153
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:27,740
good. What was that? Experience. You know how fast I can move. Here I am. One second. Next

154
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,430
second. I'm gone. What? I don't know. I'm just, I'm coping because I think I'm going to fall.

155
00:31:33,430 --> 00:32:00,619
Okay. So in games like this, sometimes you just have to go. Oh, this is bait too,

156
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:11,720
because I'm going to grab this and fall off. It's going to squish my fingers. That camera

157
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:35,420
is not fun. Okay. Now once I get up to this pipe, I'm going to just take a second.

158
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,339
There is something strange going on in this world, though there has always been something wrong.

159
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:46,680
Would everyone come to the stability has been shaken. Maybe this is a chance for me.

160
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:00,039
Oh dude, there better be an arcade up there. That's what I would do. I would put like classic

161
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,460
games up there and they're free. You don't have to, you know what I mean? Just get, once you get up,

162
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,740
what do you mean minus two? What I'm saying? Like that's a milestone. You get there and it's like,

163
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:17,420
I can, I can play like a bunch of arcade games. Now I can play like minus two silence. All of you.

164
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,769
That's why I wasn't making a joke. I was making a statement. I wasn't, that was a statement. That

165
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:35,029
was not a joke. I'm not touching that bed till I know where I'm going. What do you mean? What do

166
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:42,220
I, I said, it'd be cool if there was an arcade up there. That was a statement. All right. You,

167
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,180
I know what you're doing. You're fucking with me. Cause this is like the part where every streamer

168
00:33:45,180 --> 00:34:00,980
falls down and everybody goes, the steam come out of this shit. Do I get blasted with steam?

169
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:26,090
Oh, okay. Okay. I feel safe up here. I made it. Look how I got to test his theory

170
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:50,360
and then fucking jump off. See who hits the ground first. Do a victory dance. Not yet. Can you grab

171
00:34:50,360 --> 00:35:08,099
and like kind of shimmy on the thing? How are they floating? It's a video game. There's not even that

172
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:16,820
much left in the game. It's not like that goes up for like another four hours of gameplay.

173
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,579
All right. It looks like, hold on. Let me get a good view. Can I change the day night cycle?

174
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:42,599
Can it be like noon instead of 5 PM permanently? Risk. Okay. Risk off. Risk on. If you want to go

175
00:35:42,599 --> 00:36:06,230
quickly, go with friends. If you want to go far, go alone. Oh, what do I do? Oh shit. I'm going to

176
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:14,760
land on it. It's fine. Okay. Can I, can I move it faster? Do I have to like sprint to move it or

177
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:23,800
something? How do I change it? How do I change? Okay. I'm fine. Here you have a great view of

178
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,920
the favelas. Oh no. This is where everyone lives in poverty, which is hard to get out. Okay. Okay.

179
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Okay. How do I, how do I, how do I, how do I, should I get off? The whole life and the lives

180
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,869
of my goddamn parents have been. God damn parents. I think this is all bait to scare you.

181
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:56,969
I think I'm good. I want to look up to see. I think this ends. I don't know what to do. Should

182
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:06,280
I just keep riding it? What does this take me? In a game where you can fall and lose an hour of

183
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,820
progress? I'm freaking out right now. I'm just going to ride it. This is all bait to have you

184
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:40,360
freak out and jump off. It's all bait. I made it. Okay. Can you fail that? Or did I somehow

185
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,519
accidentally do everything correct? I don't know what I did.

186
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,260
You have to be with them and not stand out. You won't make it. You're a weak kid.

187
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,059
Go back to the favelas. Your friends are there. Your destiny and life is there. R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

188
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:17,480
Happiness there. Get a job in the favelas and live there. Okay. So obviously that way.

189
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:24,309
Put some music on. No, if I put music on, then I have to do the Pee-wee Herman dance. I know

190
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:45,980
what you're doing. That's a Gotham scenario. That's a Gotham scenario. Okay. Let me just

191
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:54,539
assess this. I'm not doing too bad. Hold on. This is an Omega jump, right? I hope so.

192
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:28,179
Holy shit. Why did I just fall? Oh my God. To get to the new one, you first have to make a jump

193
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:35,429
and get off the ground, not knowing what the future holds. I thought I missed that. I was

194
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:48,090
going to say, how is that possible? Okay. Just have confidence. The only thing that matters in

195
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:55,159
this game is confidence. Even if you fail, if you go, you're going to fucking miss.

196
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:01,539
There's a jump coming up. Jump. Go. Now. You've seen me do it a few times and it's worked out,

197
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:22,920
but sometimes it doesn't. What do you mean wait? That was the worst sound you ever made?

198
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,500
No, it is not. You've got like 13 years of audio clips of me talking. That's not possible.

199
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,559
There's like a three or 4,000 sound library of all the fucked up dumb sounds I've made.

200
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,219
That is not one of them. That's not even on the tier list. That wouldn't even get an image.

201
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:47,989
Like a PNG at the bottom of the tier list. Sorry. You're just wildly inaccurate.

202
00:40:47,989 --> 00:41:03,860
I wonder if that was a bad idea. No. All right. Where am I going? We don't think. We just go.

203
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:16,650
I thought I was slipping. I thought I was slipping off. What the fuck? Sometimes it doesn't catch.

204
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:38,469
Okay. I got to go slower here because these things are weird. Can I climb this pole?

205
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:45,820
No way. No, we'll go on the shore thing. We'll go on the shore thing.

206
00:41:48,739 --> 00:42:01,829
I'm not messing around right now. Are those balloons up there? Okay. I want to get to at

207
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:15,400
least the balloon part. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Why did it do that?

208
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:35,659
Why did it do that? He just went and then just fell. What the fuck was that? That was...

209
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:41,659
You showed me what was wrong with that jump. He just like scrunched up and put his head into his

210
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:52,949
neck and then... You've got to be fucking kidding me. What? I didn't make a mistake.

211
00:42:53,829 --> 00:43:02,599
What mistake did I make? That was clean. That was... And I told you. I knew that was... It was weird.

212
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:12,070
The collision on those trains is like fucked up. I got there once. I can get there. But that wasn't

213
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:20,710
even that hard to get there. It's just pain in the ass. It's a slow-mo feature. Yeah, but I

214
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:30,949
forget about the slow motion. I literally just jumped onto the train and it did that.

215
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:42,019
You jumped on the... Give me... All right. What was the... I forget everything. I forget everything.

216
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,460
I was too... Where's the... There's a car that I jump on and then I go from the car to the...

217
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:54,900
Over here. Where is it? I don't remember. This was an hour ago. There's like a fence and a car.

218
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:15,139
Get wrecked, pleb. I didn't even get wrecked. I did a good job. Where is the part...

219
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Get... Turn this fucking sun off. Turn the sun off. Go in the elevator? Did I actually unlock

220
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:57,940
a checkpoint? Are you guys fucking with me or is that real? There are no checkpoints. No.

221
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:09,880
Why can I not find the car... Oh, it's over here. That was such dog shit. Hey, you all know.

222
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:18,309
Everybody knows it. We all understand it. I don't even feel bad about that. I would feel bad about

223
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:27,369
that if I did something wrong, but we did a poll. There's 21,000 people here. 20,850 of you said

224
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:38,090
there was a game bug and 50 of you said that I was a stupid gamer. It was overwhelmingly

225
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:53,510
positive on my end. You ran a poll? You were one of the 50 people that... That sucks. This is all...

226
00:45:53,510 --> 00:46:17,159
I'm just trying to not freak out. Stop spreading misinformation. How close is the sun in this

227
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:40,119
universe? What the... Stop. All right. It was right up the middle and then I can go quick.

228
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:49,460
I can do it quick. That's hot dog shooter in, I don't know, the Northwest. You know what? At

229
00:46:49,460 --> 00:47:05,960
least for what I know. It's like one of the best videos ever. It was this way, right? Was it a game

230
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:17,130
bug? I'm just saying. I know how to get back here. Everything's fine. I don't want to rush

231
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:30,949
because there's more... Look, if you rush, you'll end up as an image of whatever the fuck that image

232
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:41,750
is. All right. I made it. Don't rush because the time that you lose rushing and falling versus just

233
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:53,590
doing it correctly. I just need to get to the balloons that I'm going to alter for. I'm going

234
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:58,250
to get to the balloons, do the tequila peewee Herman dance, and turn the stream off. That's

235
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:20,329
the goal for today. Show the image. I can't right now. Alt-tabbing and copying and saving and then

236
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:26,809
exporting and rendering and then putting it into OBS. And I think OBS put the bitrate at

237
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:30,489
certain kilobits to make sure it can be seen and then watch the rendering on the OBS.

238
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:41,429
I got to focus on this. Otherwise, I'll fall. And then do the necessary legal paperwork to show it

239
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:47,239
and send out all the consent forms to be able to sign and everything for

240
00:48:48,039 --> 00:49:18,309
showing it on stream. And it's just a lot. Shut up, nerd. You're plus two-ing that guy.

241
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:28,360
I crafted a joke. And it was like a fucking fine French cuisine meal.

242
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:42,329
A guy calls me a nerd and I lose the comedy war. Just shut up and go. All right. Here we go. I'm

243
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:49,940
back to where I was. Pretty much. I have to ride the thing again. Let me just see what this does.

244
00:49:49,940 --> 00:50:07,820
I'm not going to- doesn't do anything. It moves you forward. All right. We're not doing that.

245
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:31,349
Chad chatter versus the virgin Jeremy. Shut up, nerd. What the- what? You- it's not funny when I

246
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:42,309
do it? That's not fair. What do you mean that's mean? Somebody just called me a nerd. It's not

247
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:59,510
mean? Okay. I will show this one because it's really funny. I'm going to show this one because

248
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:48,980
it's good. It's good. I'm just going to- might as well. I don't even look human. I look like

249
00:51:48,980 --> 00:52:07,559
a different species. All right. Don't distract me. I'm working on something. Do you look like

250
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:15,369
the Teletubbies? What about over here? There's something over there. Am I too much of a coward

251
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:26,150
to go look? Yeah. I think so. Let's just do what I did before. Once I get off the rollercoaster,

252
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:41,860
that's when I'm pretty much back where I was. Teletubby's son? Yeah. Risk on. Risk on. Risk off.

253
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:52,579
All right. We're just going to sit here and just hang out. Can I actually fall off this or

254
00:52:52,579 --> 00:53:05,300
my good just to hang out and look at chat and stuff? Is that okay? Am I going to get like

255
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:23,940
just jump right now? No, don't think so. No, that's good. Oh, I have to choose the directions. I

256
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:35,059
didn't do that last time. I definitely was not doing that last time. I just look at it. I wonder

257
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:51,289
if people are lying to me. It's probably true. I'm good. I'm good. That was a dangerous thing, kid.

258
00:53:51,289 --> 00:54:13,460
Don't do that again. Why is it so quiet? The volume's even turned up too. Why is the volume

259
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:21,880
so low? Did you see the live action One Piece trailer? They go, yeah, yo, yeah, yo. Do they?

260
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:34,150
Really? Do they actually do that? No, they don't. They do not do that. I wouldn't bet any money,

261
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:52,739
but I would friendly bet you that they do not do that. No, I'm busy. This is where I was before,

262
00:54:52,739 --> 00:55:01,420
and this is where it all became a disaster. Slow down. The game, this part of the game is

263
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:23,500
fucked, okay? Risk on. Risk off. There's a little bit of momentum when you land.

264
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:42,739
Okay, slow it down. Where did I get caught up? It was right here, right? We're good. No, wait,

265
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:52,780
it was after this. It was after this. It's up here. Up there. Oh, up there. I'm almost there.

266
00:55:52,780 --> 00:56:02,570
All right. Yeah, yo, yeah, yo. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. I don't even need

267
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:08,780
to be up here, do I? This is kind of a mistake, but I'm kind of terrified to go any other way.

268
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:32,090
This is the only way that I know. Risk on. Risk off. All right, this is it over here. I

269
00:56:32,090 --> 00:57:04,250
got to make this. That is exactly where I lost last time, wasn't it? No, it was up here. All

270
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:20,360
back to the beginning, it would be really funny. All right, so pay attention time. What the hell

271
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:51,320
even happened here? It was right here. We're good. All right, there's going to be a hole that I can

272
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,760
fall through, or one of these is going to open. One of these is going to open up. A window is

273
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:28,500
going to open. Oh, shit. Is this a full sprint omega jump, or do I walk on that? Risk off. I

274
00:58:28,500 --> 00:59:02,599
forgot to say it was on. Where are most of the balloons? That's going to be so bad. That's going

275
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:56,809
to be so bad. Jesus. All right. Assess. Assess first. No, I have to do this. So I have to go all

276
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:18,789
the way over there, and then, well, I could go risk on and go that way. Let me look at it. Do not. Do

277
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:25,260
not. Do not. Should I go? I could go risk on and do a full jump right now and just jump on that.

278
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:37,420
Risk off. Risk off. Okay. All right. You sure? I think I'm doing it. Risk on. Risk. All right.

279
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:49,480
Fine. Risk off. Risk off. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Oh, my God. This thing is really fucked up.

280
01:00:51,940 --> 01:01:02,389
Okay. But do I want to go all the way over there, or do I just drop here and go that way?

281
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:08,969
Now, there's nothing over there. This is the, is this the only way to go? Yep. Oh, that does not

282
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:42,869
look good. Drop. Oh, you soft locked yourself? No, it didn't look right there. Oh, this is so

283
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:51,099
fucked up. I actually can't even walk this way. What about right there? What about I'm so,

284
01:01:52,539 --> 01:02:16,039
that's a long way down. I can fix it. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Thank

285
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:26,010
God. Thank God. Thank goodness. I'm going to puke. I thought I was going to fall. All right. Risk off.

286
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:32,820
I don't know. Why would this even be here? This to me looks like a shortcut. It probably is.

287
01:02:32,820 --> 01:03:03,510
Risk off. Do you see how weird this thing is? Do you want a secret tip? I'm not looking at

288
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:09,880
anything else. The only thing I care about is this kid's hat in the middle of the pipe.

289
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:24,980
I'm not looking at anything else. Why would I pay attention to anything else? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I mean,

290
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:50,599
I'm just not going to do this. Do you know what I'm saying? No way. I'll miss it. I'm too far up.

291
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:57,500
My God. Just focus on the hat. You fucking idiot. I'm there. I'm right there. You can't

292
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:32,199
crack under the pressure right now. You're literally 85% of the way done. Now where?

293
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:44,710
Fuck. What's worse? The scary pipe. I know how to do the pipe. Wait, can I just do this?

294
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:56,599
I know how to do the pipe. I've done it. I just did it before. I know how it works.

295
01:04:57,849 --> 01:05:04,550
I'm going for pipe, but I got to do an omega jump from here. Oh, I just do it. Just do it. Risk on.

296
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:32,469
Yep. Don't even think about it. Just go. Okay. Give me a second. Captain Crunch is up here

297
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:37,179
and he's laughing at me. And he's like, fucking with me. I got to get rid of him.

298
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:42,869
Just give me a second. Captain Crunch is making fun of me right now. He's just like,

299
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:46,469
oh, my Captain Crunch cereal is more nutritious than this fucking dope.

300
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:52,650
He's up there and I got to get rid of him. He's like laughing in the chat. I don't know why. It's

301
01:05:52,650 --> 01:06:36,900
like the white and blue hat. I just saw the white and blue hat. They're playing quop. Just do the

302
01:06:36,900 --> 01:07:29,460
fucking snail strategy. It works. I'm about to turn the risk on and just fucking run. This is

303
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:47,929
a very effective strategy, but it's funny looking and like, hey, hey, hey, why is he turning this way?

304
01:07:47,929 --> 01:08:39,779
I didn't turn him that way. I didn't turn him that way. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm not jumping from here.

305
01:08:39,779 --> 01:09:01,579
I'm not jumping from here. That would be a huge mistake. Did I just punch the bike?

306
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:16,100
Oops. I'm sorry. I was doing the roar. Okay. Now what? I was doing the lion pose from 2018.

307
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:22,010
Be careful. Don't go too fast. I'm going to take a second here because I'll be honest with you.

308
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:26,260
It's time for me to get a little, uh, just to toot my own horn a little bit.

309
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,500
A lot of you thought I was going to fail at the pipes like 40 minutes ago,

310
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:39,720
and I deserve an apology. I can't wait. I think I deserve, I think I deserve an apology.

311
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:55,829
We are not sorry. No, no, no, no. I'll get it eventually. If I get to the top,

312
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:02,329
I'm going to see a bunch of sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, dude. I'm so sorry. You're so cool.

313
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:24,779
Okay. Obvious. Oh, more pipe shit. Um, yeah, that's the right way. It's very obviously the

314
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:41,079
correct way. Oh, I'm so scared to jump and grab this. I feel like I'm not high enough.

315
01:10:41,640 --> 01:11:07,670
Am I high enough to grab this fucking thing? Oh, my God. I almost dropped. Shit. All right.

316
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:15,739
He's high. I actually said to Holly before I turned the stream on. I was like, if I like,

317
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:21,899
would I even be able to get past the first jump high if I did this high? She just shook her head.

318
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:40,890
She just went, okay, maybe I shouldn't do it. I just want us to remember this moment when I

319
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:44,649
got here and we're just like hanging out. You were going to? No, I was just saying like,

320
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:52,100
would I even be able to? I'm not talking about like, I'm just talking about in general. Um,

321
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,369
let's just, can I just savor this? Because I'm probably going to fall in like 10 minutes.

322
01:11:55,369 --> 01:12:12,840
All right, let's go back to walking. And I feel like I need to jump onto this. And we're just

323
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,239
going to go straight. And I guess I have to go up that pipe, which is going to be unbearable.

324
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:22,579
So don't do anything stupid. I've got plenty of time. It's not like I'm on a time limit.

325
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:45,420
I would make a comment on, you know, the world and the environment and shit, but I,

326
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:58,390
I'm, this is, I've, I've, I've, you know what I'm saying? I cannot fall off of this. Somebody said,

327
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:10,890
okay. I would make, I can't make any comments right now. Turn risk on. Oh,

328
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:18,840
am I going to never mind? Am I going to say it? But again, am I going to get it or is it going to

329
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:41,260
glitch out? Wait, what? This is not world of warcraft, dude. You can't turn the camera to

330
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:49,020
get a better view and then use W to go forward. I almost just did that. My fucking heart.

331
01:13:49,020 --> 01:14:04,600
Holy shit. I almost just did that. I almost did the world of warcraft. Get a better angle.

332
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:20,789
Only go, only look forward. Don't look back. Don't look down. What's with this camera? Stop it.

333
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:53,079
Camera. What are you doing? Stop doing this. What's with this camera right now? Oh my goodness.

334
01:14:53,079 --> 01:15:26,460
Everybody fails at that part because they don't get it. I do. I wonder if I jump from here or do

335
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:35,109
I go from the end and try to catch the side or do I try to catch the perpendicular, you know what

336
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:43,130
I mean? Perpendicular shave. You monster. I'm just going to go until it's like all the way down to

337
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:53,020
my fucking chest. If I was, if it were me doing this and it is I'm going from here and I'm actually

338
01:15:53,020 --> 01:16:16,600
terrified right now. The other part of me is saying go to the end and grab onto the edge. Well,

339
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:23,579
we just got to risk on. That's what you do. You just turn risk on. Sometimes you just have to do

340
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:51,460
it. Just stop thinking about it and just go. Uh oh. Just risk on. What the fuck is going on here?

341
01:16:51,460 --> 01:17:16,630
This is fucked up. Where? What? Okay. What? Hold on. Let's assess this. Risk on? No, no, not yet.

342
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:33,000
Not yet. I don't know if I can, I can't grab onto this. Risk on. I was completely risk off there and

343
01:17:33,000 --> 01:18:03,140
that was a, that was stupid. Let's fucking go. I, I thought that was the end. Oh dear. No way.

344
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:33,180
Okay. My hands are like kind of shaking. Jesus. Where are the balloons? Am I almost, I'm almost

345
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:46,539
at the balloons. We're good. I'm literally shaking. I'm going to go. Stopping now is a bad idea.

346
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:51,500
I'm just going to go up this pipe because like there's a bunch of shit over there. I could go.

347
01:18:51,500 --> 01:19:07,270
No, I see, I see where I'm going. I'm going this way. Do it. Do it. Do it. This is a boat. Oh,

348
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:22,550
it's like a factory. Take it slow. I, yep. I'm going to take it slow. This is, this is here to fuck

349
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:46,420
with you or no, it's not. Is it though? It might be here to fuck with you. This might be a sprint

350
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:57,850
jump. No, it's, I don't think so. This is a sprint jump. Holy shit. I thought I was done.

351
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:25,050
No, what? Oh, YouTube thumbnail. What the heck? I know, but seriously, like what the fuck? Dude.

352
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:53,079
I did it. I made it to the fucking factory. Geez. All right. Settle down. This does not look too bad,

353
01:20:53,079 --> 01:21:49,220
but who knows, right? There's a shit load left. I'm almost at the balloons, which is where my,

354
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:55,800
okay. You know, in Hearthstone battlegrounds, when you, uh, if you get in the top four,

355
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:03,289
it's considered a win. That's my top four. That's the, I placed top four in battlegrounds.

356
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:23,819
I don't care if I lose. I don't care if I get number one. Okay. Balloons is like the energy

357
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:30,779
win thing. This is not even 40%. Stop looking up. What are you talking about? I want to,

358
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:37,220
I need to see where the fuck I'm going. Nothing else up here. No, this is the right way.

359
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:43,340
I could go that way too, but no, that looks horrible. I almost just fell off right there.

360
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:50,500
What a fucking blunder that would have been. Fourth place is third loser. You still get two

361
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:55,460
points in Mario Kart. That's two points that number five doesn't get. I'm good. Your nose

362
01:22:55,460 --> 01:23:06,760
is sweating. Wipe the sweat from your nose. I wipe the sweat from my nose when you wipe the grease

363
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:21,560
from your hair. Birth, kindergarten, school, army, institute, factory, death. What? We're bouncing

364
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:38,789
back and forth today. I'm, I'm giving it back. Is it really bad? Hold on. Why are you so mean?

365
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:47,699
No, I'm just bouncing it back. That works better if your hair doesn't look wicked greasy.

366
01:23:47,699 --> 01:24:04,409
Your hair is 10 times greasier than mine. It only works if I'm clean. Please. Come on. All

367
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:10,060
right. No more messing around. I expelled a lot of that like nervous energy, right? Just like you

368
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:14,460
got to get it out because we're, this is about to get fucked up. So I got to pay attention.

369
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:23,609
Okay. We're just bouncing it back, dude. We're good. I should, I said shiny, not greasy. All

370
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:28,819
right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. This is way, I'm like halfway through this game that nobody

371
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:32,819
thought I was ever going to make it to the piece of American cheese. And I'm sorry, but you were

372
01:24:32,819 --> 01:25:01,000
wrong and you're seething in chat right now. Jesus. Okay. No, I think it's all right. This is

373
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,239
all right. I can't fall through the middle. I don't think that would be weird if I could.

374
01:25:07,029 --> 01:25:12,600
Is this an omega jump though? I, it might be, go. I just scared the shit out of myself to do it.

375
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:43,159
What the? Jeremy, not you, me. Stop that nonsense. Balloons.

376
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:28,760
I almost just lost to a stupid slow motion joke. Train onto the train maybe. I don't think there's

377
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:43,239
anywhere else to go. This might be a bad idea. Let me go. I want to look. Did I miss something?

378
01:26:43,239 --> 01:27:07,539
I think it on top. This is probably really stupid what I'm doing. No, that's, that's definitely

379
01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:18,199
right. That's absolutely correct. Happy pride. That's right. It's pride month. Happy pride,

380
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:41,350
everybody. Happy pride month. Am I doing this wrong? This, that I glitched through that.

381
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:47,670
That felt, that felt fucked up. No, I can't even grab onto that. I'm paranoid to go in there,

382
01:27:47,670 --> 01:28:04,039
but I'm guessing I'm going to. Oh shit. Okay. Well, I found where I need to go.

383
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:10,220
I don't think this is right. I don't think I can make that jump. Even if it's an Omega jump.

384
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:22,979
Risk on? Fine. This camera sucks. I'm stuck. That's not, that's not correct. Thank God it

385
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:31,430
stopped me. There's no way that's correct. I got, it's, I went, I went, I went into an invisible wall.

386
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:38,229
I don't know where to go. I'm paranoid to do anything. I feel like I had the right idea here.

387
01:28:38,229 --> 01:29:15,560
It's not. Rail to that, to that. Is it about this side? It's right here. How come I didn't grab on

388
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:41,300
the last few times? Um, well, even if I miss, it's fine. Why? I thought that was a scary

389
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:55,579
horror movie sound. I don't like this. I don't like this Minecraft spawner. Yeah. I am terrified.

390
01:29:55,579 --> 01:30:38,409
Risk on. Okay. Now what? This way over here off the tractor. All right. It looks like there's a

391
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:49,590
couple ways to go. I can go over there to the right and up. Let's get a good look. Yeah. No.

392
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:55,539
Okay. This is right. It's really stupid for me to jump from here to there to save what amounts to

393
01:30:55,539 --> 01:31:01,750
four seconds. My brain is trying to tell me to hurry the fuck up and go over there and do it.

394
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:05,750
No. Risk off. You need to know when to turn it on and when to turn it off.

395
01:31:07,989 --> 01:31:30,760
Should I go to the cheese? What do you think? No. How do you go from, where do you go from the cheese?

396
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:39,960
What is on the cheese right now, actually? What is that? I don't see any way up there.

397
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:54,090
Is it a bed? So that's harder, but it's essentially a shortcut. I don't know. Uh-uh. I'm way too far.

398
01:31:54,649 --> 01:32:30,949
No. Risk off. Risk off. Sorry. It's not worth it. It's no. Uh, how do I? I think I have to do it.

399
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:43,270
No, I don't. I thought I had to do the cheese. I feel safe moving pretty quickly up here just

400
01:32:43,270 --> 01:33:24,630
because if I fall, it doesn't matter. I'm going to land right here. Where the hell am I? This is

401
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:32,180
not connected to anything. Don't I? It's a strange feeling. I've never been this far away from home.

402
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:58,359
Risk on. Oh, yes. My undertaker. Destroy him. I didn't know that happened. It's a good thing

403
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:04,659
I fucking jumped. Holy shit. It's a good thing I jumped when I did because I would have just lost.

404
01:34:04,659 --> 01:34:17,899
Wowee. Wow. That was horrifying. Okay. I've gotten kind of lucky the last couple of big jumps.

405
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:40,060
Where am I going from here? I can fall through this shit. This is not going to be fun. Can I

406
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:50,229
fall through this? I guess I can't. It looks like I can go right through here, but I'm not falling

407
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:56,859
right now. Why am I not falling through this? You cannot. Okay. I hope you're not lying to me. This

408
01:34:56,859 --> 01:35:01,859
is like an hour and four. This is an hour and 10 minutes of progress. Please don't lie to me.

409
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:42,859
Okay. Where is this one going to go? Oh my God. I had to release some gas right there. Okay.

410
01:35:42,859 --> 01:36:05,260
Everything's fine. Holy shit. I think I'm getting, I might be getting kind of close to being in a

411
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:10,569
position where I might be able to finish this video game in like another hour. If I do good,

412
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:17,939
just don't make any mistakes. Let me be the first streamer on Twitch to fall like once really and

413
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:22,180
beat the game in like three tries. Let's go for it. You know what I'm saying? Let me get like an

414
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:39,020
accolade for once in the last like three or four years. That bug just got on me. A bug is on me.

415
01:36:39,020 --> 01:37:01,340
Spider, it's a huge one. Okay. These don't be stupid. Jesus Christ. Oh no, no, no. My accolade,

416
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:08,859
my accolade, my accolade. No, I need my accolade. Oh no. Oh, big mistakes. This is bad.

417
01:37:08,859 --> 01:37:28,220
My accolade. I was, holy shit. No, I just, I risked on and I wouldn't risk off and I was stuck.

418
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:36,060
I couldn't walk forward. The cones, the cones have collision that are a full fucking rectangle

419
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:45,640
around them and I thought I was stuck and I freaked out. I couldn't walk. There was two cones and they

420
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:56,090
had a gigantic collision in front of them. I thought I was going to slip off. Risk on for the

421
01:37:56,090 --> 01:38:03,449
rest of the fucking stream. I was doing so good too. It's just like, look at this. I'm back at the

422
01:38:03,449 --> 01:38:18,920
fucking roller coaster segment. I didn't do it on purpose. I thought I landed on it, but God

423
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:27,020
fucking damn it. I thought I screwed it up. When I slipped back that time, I thought I was going to

424
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:32,039
keep going. I was like, fuck, I'm going to jump on the bed and just go for it. This was 25 minutes

425
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,819
into the stream. Don't worry. I'll get back there in 10 minutes. Time it. Watch this. I was going to

426
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:41,960
zone out and fucking risk on. I'll get back there in 10 minutes. I'm going to risk on

427
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:49,529
big time. You don't even know. You better believe that this is going full risk on right now and I'm

428
01:38:49,529 --> 01:39:05,159
going to get to the top in 10 minutes. I'm not fucking around. Here we go. Do it to the

429
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:18,789
supermarket sweep music. It's a good idea. Supermarket sweep OST. That doesn't come up

430
01:39:18,789 --> 01:40:12,539
with anything. No, I'm not ready yet. We're not ready yet. Settings, loop. How do I loop it?

431
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:42,119
Right click it. Will he reach the crane again by 745? You had better vote yes. What do you think

432
01:40:42,119 --> 01:47:15,020
about urinal cakes? They smell. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? We're good. So I think what I

433
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:20,539
have to do is just go risk on, keep the risk on and just go. I'm sweating.

434
01:47:21,340 --> 01:49:39,369
What the hell are you doing? I just had to go because like that's the hardest jump and I was

435
01:49:39,369 --> 01:49:47,140
like, I just, I didn't realize I was still holding shift. I was still holding shift and I didn't

436
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:58,180
realize it was still holding it. It was the, it was just, my finger was still on it. I was, I was

437
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:04,760
good. I threw so hard. I don't want to hear anything from this person. Don't be afraid. You

438
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:18,229
can always repeat. Oh, my accolades. Oh, that's sad. That jump is not shift. The one before it

439
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:32,100
can be. Oh, I'm so sad. I'm so mad. My accolades. No, my accolades. I can get back there. I can,

440
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:35,939
let me get back there. I just didn't even get to the balloons. Why are the stupid crane?

441
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:47,750
That crane part I'm fucking furious at. Don't let Captain Crunch win. Yeah, he's cracking up right

442
01:50:47,750 --> 01:51:09,420
now. Get it out. There's still three minutes left. Yeah, my problem was that that's a regular running

443
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:21,539
jump. Fucked it up. It's all right. It's all right. We're hanging out. We're here. Just say,

444
01:51:21,539 --> 01:51:36,220
God, go, go like pet your dog for a little while. Come back. Like 10 minutes. Sometimes it's hard

445
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:41,500
to choose the right path, but don't be afraid. You can always repeat. We learn from our mistakes.

446
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:46,939
See that save right there? That's from experience. That's from playing this game for an hour and

447
01:51:46,939 --> 01:52:09,659
having experience. Shut up. OK. Oh, some of those jumps were so hard, too. And I was nailing them.

448
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:13,340
I was nailing some of those. You know what I mean? Like you were watching you were like,

449
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:19,079
holy shit, he's kind of nailing this on the second time he's ever seen it. I was nailing it.

450
01:52:19,079 --> 01:52:28,300
Any other like game show music to fucking get me pumped up? I got to have like game show theme

451
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:52,970
songs. That's a good one. Family Feud theme. That was kind of like goofy, though, isn't it?

452
01:52:52,970 --> 01:53:12,760
It's like it's like it's like circus music, isn't it? Yeah, this guy is too goofy.

453
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:22,630
American Bible Challenge. Yeah, absolutely. That's now you know, you're speaking my language.

454
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:36,810
OK, American Bible Challenge theme song. This is 20 seconds. This is going to get

455
01:53:37,289 --> 01:53:44,710
become unbearable after a little while. All right. The American Bible Challenge theme song.

456
01:53:44,710 --> 01:54:03,989
Oh, I can't. This is not going to work. We need something else. We need something else.

457
01:54:03,989 --> 01:54:10,090
That's not going to be OK. We'll go back to Family Feud. Whatever. It's not like I'm going

458
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:16,420
to get back to her. This is for it. I don't need to loop it. It's already an hour long video.

459
01:54:25,989 --> 01:55:04,630
No, guys, why would I listen to this version when I can listen to this one? This is fucking good.

460
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:41,319
Holy shit. This is great. I thought it was a bird at first. I love this so much.

461
01:55:41,319 --> 01:56:05,539
This is actually fucking great. Why did I look at chat? That was awesome. All right. What else?

462
01:56:05,539 --> 01:56:14,659
I need something that I can just put back here. Who wants to be a millionaire? No,

463
01:56:14,659 --> 01:56:22,520
that like we need something with a beat, something old to supermarket sweep. I don't know.

464
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:27,239
I mean, I'm going to my whole channel is going to get shut off, but I don't do the fates.

465
01:56:27,239 --> 01:56:31,979
I feel like that's a pretty good one. Whatever. I don't give a shit. I'm putting it on.

466
01:56:31,979 --> 01:57:29,430
I just want to just one and that's it. What's going on? What's going on? That's so low.

467
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:41,420
The beginning is really quiet. Oh, I should probably turn it down then.

468
01:58:05,689 --> 01:58:09,930
I don't care anymore. This month for like five seconds. Um, I need like

469
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:22,810
catchy something that can sit in the background. Oprah's theme, the crystal light aerobics theme.

470
01:58:22,810 --> 01:59:00,899
This is good. I'm into it. The 1988 crystal light national aerobic championship.

471
01:59:00,899 --> 02:00:08,760
Excuse me. What the hell was that? Oh, my accolades. What the fuck is happening?

472
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:12,680
Why does that keep happening? That hasn't, I, that's not, that's a twice in a row.

473
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:28,409
The song is cursed by accolades. So that song's cursed. I like it though. Um,

474
02:00:28,409 --> 02:00:42,840
the smash brothers pac-man music. Ooh, that's a good one. That's a really good one.

475
02:00:42,840 --> 02:01:12,859
You know, one that goes, risk on. I got to ride the roller coaster though. We can't even get

476
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:26,180
hyped up yet. I'm saving this because we have to ride the roller coaster and I,

477
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:40,119
uh, just give it a minute. Give it a minute. Why are these games have to be so addicting?

478
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:59,369
These games with total complete failure, they have to be so addicting. And it's like the heck.

479
02:01:59,369 --> 02:02:06,359
Okay. So what keeps happening here? I've been standing in the same spot each time. It's right

480
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:18,409
here. This just kind of goes kind of completely off the rails. The game's bugged. The game's bugged.

481
02:02:18,409 --> 02:02:26,300
The game is bugged. There's a bug. Am I going to have to walk the train track?

482
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:39,350
Walk the tracks. Dude, that sucks. I guess I could. That's not a problem.

483
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:53,029
Some of those jumps are going to be hard without the, without the train. Aren't they?

484
02:02:53,029 --> 02:02:55,210
On camera. What are you doing?

485
02:03:24,869 --> 02:03:38,420
Music on. Not yet. I got to get to a spot where I'm comfortable. Why am I doing this?

486
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:56,090
Because the cart is bugged and keeps kicking me off. I can be, I am my own cart right now.

487
02:03:56,090 --> 02:04:26,859
All right. Here we are. I just smashed a big peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Nice.

488
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:59,140
Oh, wait, which way do I go? Okay. This way. Oh, why am I looking? I hope you enjoy your sandwich.

489
02:05:02,659 --> 02:05:12,970
I just ride the car. Oh my God. My hair just dude. And that's not where I want to be, man.

490
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:26,949
This bugs out again that I'm just going to reset the game accolades by accolades.

491
02:05:26,949 --> 02:05:40,060
Oh, don't give them to me. So is it something in the road? I've done this,

492
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:46,500
ridden this thing like five to 10 times already and I never get like launched out.

493
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:56,699
That is a bug in the game and it needs to be fixed whenever the developer has time.

494
02:05:56,699 --> 02:06:07,000
Making a game, patching a game, the whole operation. A lot goes into it. A lot of code and

495
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:43,340
shit. Why do I look like Jesus? Centrist Andy. All right. What do you say we wake up a little

496
02:06:43,340 --> 02:07:01,640
when I get here? I'm going to wipe my hands. I'm going to wipe my face. Wipe your ass too.

497
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:35,399
This game is, can you hear that? You hear a fucking fast, my heart is going and

498
02:07:36,279 --> 02:09:07,420
Oh, and wipe your ass too. Quick name your four person video game party.

499
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:14,729
Pac-Man, Star Fox, Link and Solid Snake would be in mine.

500
02:09:44,439 --> 02:10:20,060
What about the portal companion cube? Yeah, I forgot.

501
02:11:11,989 --> 02:11:35,479
Excuse me. Sorry. I need a new song that got me up here. We need something better than that to get

502
02:11:35,479 --> 02:11:55,609
me to where we just were. I need something better than that. It's going to be hard though.

503
02:11:55,609 --> 02:11:58,649
Pizza tower would be pretty good here, but I feel like we overuse it.

504
02:11:58,649 --> 02:12:01,590
All right. We'll do the, what's, what's the one that goes like

505
02:12:04,229 --> 02:12:08,619
that's game of the year by the way, unless Final Fantasy 16 is like better

506
02:12:08,619 --> 02:12:28,520
that in Res, uh, Resident Evil 4. Uh, was it called hurry up or something? This is it.

507
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:33,930
All right. I'm going to be fucking crazy right now. Are you ready?

508
02:12:34,569 --> 02:12:51,319
You're going to think my hands have just like sticky tape or sticky glue all over it. Whatever.

509
02:12:51,319 --> 02:12:58,420
I'm not going to miss a single jump. This is where it counts. This, this part is fucking hard.

510
02:12:59,220 --> 02:16:19,899
Risk on. Oh, I just stepped in dog shit. Oh, this music's changing. I need something better than

511
02:16:19,899 --> 02:16:42,329
that. This is not bad either. Do lap two music. I'm not doing fall guys. Oh yeah. The sans theme

512
02:16:42,329 --> 02:17:00,600
song. That's a good one too. That might be too, that may be too much city escape. That's the, uh,

513
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:07,959
I feel like that one's going to fuck me up, but I'll do it. That's going to, that's going to screw

514
02:17:07,959 --> 02:18:15,590
it up. But look, we're going to be fine. I want to see bat chests only. If you just came to the

515
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:21,750
stream right now, you would be like, holy shit, this chat is fucking toxic. This chat is awful.

516
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:27,989
He's playing a song he likes and they're just fucking roasting them. This chat is so bad is

517
02:18:27,989 --> 02:18:34,790
what people would say. Just like, man, holy shit. He's just getting completely fucking roasted.

518
02:18:34,790 --> 02:19:04,379
I'm going to start it over. Oh yeah. Get up there. I'm not in it anymore. All right. Important right

519
02:19:04,379 --> 02:20:28,889
here. Can I turn it up? I'll turn it up louder. What the hell? I'm stuck.

520
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:58,219
I got stuck on something. What did I get stuck on? Do you see my character was like,

521
02:20:59,020 --> 02:21:09,260
well, I got fucking strapped on something. What was that? My character didn't even jump. He just

522
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:19,899
went fucking. God damn it. Where do I go from here? I'm it's, but we're fine. I've, this is not that

523
02:21:19,899 --> 02:21:32,579
far. How am I? This goofy ass music. Now it's not, this is Mario brothers. This is not goofy

524
02:21:32,579 --> 02:21:44,260
ass music. It's, it's, it's a little goofy. Okay. It's going on my voice today. That's a little

525
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:55,719
goofy. Where, how do I get it? Shut this off. My character, I was running for the jump and he just

526
02:21:55,719 --> 02:22:10,579
went like, he just like, how do I get back over there? The left, I can't make this jump. Oh,

527
02:22:10,579 --> 02:22:28,819
there you mean like over there. Fuck. Oh no. You only get one of those this year. Perfect.

528
02:22:37,989 --> 02:22:44,469
This is not that bad. I got stuck. Oh, I would be so much more angry at that if it wasn't really

529
02:22:44,469 --> 02:23:04,139
funny. That was like the 11th one you've done this year. Well, there's a long, a year is a long time.

530
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:16,120
I got this. I got this completely done at this point. It was so stupid. Yeah. We're going music

531
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:28,649
list for right now. Let me just get back to where I was. Why don't I just like skip this whole thing?

532
02:23:29,450 --> 02:23:43,420
I mean, that was what I did last time. Let's do it again. The music is helps you though.

533
02:23:44,059 --> 02:24:07,100
How about this goofy ass music back on? Oh no, that's it. That jump is the worst because no,

534
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:19,819
turn it off. Um, how about, I love Super Mario. I grew up with this game. Don't forget that.

535
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:27,190
I grew up playing Super Mario World. It was like the game. Super Mario World was the Fortnite when

536
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:34,040
I was like fucking 10. Come on. This is my Fortnite here. Don't you tell me what my Fortnite is and

537
02:24:34,040 --> 02:25:01,530
isn't. Was this back in the forties? Chrono Trigger battle music. That's not the one I want.

538
02:25:01,850 --> 02:25:33,670
I want the original. I want the original. Where's the original? Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to,

539
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:37,510
I'm going to add that to my likes on YouTube. I'll listen to that one like five to 10,000 times

540
02:25:37,510 --> 02:26:05,399
later tonight. Where's the original one? These are all like the remake in the remaster. I mean,

541
02:26:05,399 --> 02:26:13,209
I've got a way better one. Uh, this is, I'm not going to say what, um, what this is, but this is

542
02:26:13,209 --> 02:26:19,670
a good one. This is, don't be, people are going to say, say in Chrono Trigger spoilers. So just

543
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:25,500
fucking relax. Okay. Be careful in the chat. Cause when I play this, this is, this one is a banger.

544
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:29,260
This is an absolute banger. You can bad chest me. That's fine. But this is one of the final themes

545
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:34,379
of the game. Here it comes. And it's going to get me to the top. This shit's going to get me to the

546
02:26:34,379 --> 02:26:49,450
fucking top of this game. It's not the right one. Wait. No, it is. It is. It is. It is. No, it is.

547
02:26:49,450 --> 02:28:18,739
Let's go. Oh, freaking Chrono Trigger. This is wrong. Here's the right one. It's going to get

548
02:28:18,739 --> 02:29:09,979
loud. This is like a four minute intro. Hold on a second. How long is this part? Let's go.

549
02:29:15,959 --> 02:30:12,340
I got to get out of this fucking industrial area. It's going to get loud. Oh, don't look at chat.

550
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:52,469
Don't look at them. I just, I just ran into the collision. What the fuck? Can I even save this?

551
02:30:52,469 --> 02:31:35,799
I was running, running to jump and then fall. Why is this a slowed down version of the song

552
02:31:35,879 --> 02:31:51,620
I was just listening to? It's mocking me. Use the elevator. I don't think the elevator works.

553
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:56,809
Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid. You can always repeat.

554
02:31:56,809 --> 02:32:03,510
We learn from our mistakes. I didn't make a mistake. I didn't make a mistake. Clip it.

555
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:18,709
Clip it. You fell on purpose. No, I went to run on the barrel and I've done that jump like four

556
02:32:18,709 --> 02:32:24,069
times. This time I apparently was hitting a weird collision part of the barrel and I Super Mario

557
02:32:24,069 --> 02:32:45,860
mid animations got stuck in and fell. He's, he's actually angry. I got it out of my system.

558
02:32:45,860 --> 02:33:03,299
I'm going again. This is, this doesn't do anything though. All right. This time we're going to slow

559
02:33:03,299 --> 02:33:31,079
it down. We're going to play like fucking piano, like royalty free piano, and I'm going to go slow.

560
02:33:31,079 --> 02:33:40,920
Use night mode. It's said soon. Should I just go get water and put tears coming down my eyes

561
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:50,700
and just have a cry face for like 30 minutes? Hold on. Should I say like watching like a sad

562
02:33:50,700 --> 02:34:20,360
movie on my other monitor? Hold on a minute. Watching Titanic on other monitor. I'll just like

563
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:32,899
glance over here all the time and just be like, this needs to be a little bigger. Give me one

564
02:34:32,899 --> 02:37:13,719
second. I'm going to pee. I'm back. Okay. So let's do this. Can you like, can you see if I do this?

565
02:37:13,719 --> 02:37:42,520
Can you see it? You can't see it? Hold on. I'll turn the light on. Give me a sec. I'm not going

566
02:37:42,520 --> 02:38:04,500
to pour it on my face. Okay. You should be able to see a little bit better now. I put a bunch of

567
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:22,920
tears. Hold on. Hold on. Just wait. You can see better now, right? So if I go like this,

568
02:38:22,920 --> 02:39:00,149
is that showing up better? Kinda. Fuck. I can't see it. You need to look wet. You just look wet.

569
02:39:00,149 --> 02:39:10,329
I just look like I'm covered in fucking water. Just stick your whole head in the, no. Hold on.

570
02:39:10,329 --> 02:40:15,829
You just look sweaty. God. I'm sorry guys. I've never seen this fucking movie before.

571
02:40:15,829 --> 02:40:36,280
This is fucking awful. I'm turning this off. I'm turning this off. Why would I? This is awful.

572
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:43,030
This is the worst fucking thing I've ever done. This is not funny. I'm just wet. I'm just wet.

573
02:40:43,030 --> 02:40:53,299
I've just, it's like I got hit in the face with a water balloon. I need red eyes. I'm just

574
02:40:53,299 --> 02:41:01,299
fucking sweaty. Oh yeah. I've never seen this movie before. I'm like really sweating. I actually

575
02:41:01,299 --> 02:41:11,260
kind of feel good. I can't even listen to this song anymore. Let me turn, hold on. You need to,

576
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:24,819
no. I'm fucking done. I'm playing the game now. Why would you even stream at that point? Did I

577
02:41:24,819 --> 02:41:32,260
tell you guys my bit that I wanted to do so bad? It was to do, you know, whatever. Steal it. Whoever.

578
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:39,209
It's just, I get, I get 5% royalties. I want to do full cam react to a movie that's not happening.

579
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:45,690
And it's like an hour and 35 minutes of me sitting there reacting to like the Mario movie,

580
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:49,049
but it's, I'm not actually watching it. And you, like, we're going to watch it together.

581
02:41:49,049 --> 02:42:00,229
I want 10% royalties if you do that. Just sit there and I'll be reacting to shit like, oh dude,

582
02:42:00,229 --> 02:42:05,110
Toad, what the fuck is Toad doing? Toad might not even be on the screen. He might not even be on

583
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:10,260
camera. And I sit there for an hour and 30 minutes and pretend like we're doing a watch along of the

584
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:23,020
Mario movie. That's pretty good, right? Or make it generic. We're going to do a watch along.

585
02:42:23,659 --> 02:42:31,459
I can imagine like, hey, hey everybody. Today we're doing a watch along of whatever movie you're

586
02:42:31,459 --> 02:42:37,780
watching, whatever movie you care about. So right now we can, we can queue it up if we want to start.

587
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:41,989
It doesn't matter what movie you're watching. You and I are watching it together. And three,

588
02:42:41,989 --> 02:42:44,549
two, one. It doesn't matter what movie you're watching. I just sit there for an hour and 40

589
02:42:44,549 --> 02:42:50,600
minutes and I fake watch a movie and queue it up with everything and anything. Queue it up with

590
02:42:50,600 --> 02:43:05,610
the Smurfs movie for all I care. Get up and go to the bathroom and come back 30 minutes later.

591
02:43:05,610 --> 02:43:11,510
I don't get it. Neither do I, but I think it's funny. Well, okay. Would you guys play along?

592
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:14,469
Would you guys, if I did that on stream, why would, why would it be a stream? I would just

593
02:43:14,469 --> 02:43:23,770
upload this video. I would just give it to you guys and you just put it on anything. I don't care.

594
02:43:23,770 --> 02:43:29,430
You, you'd play along? Why does this camera look brighter? All right. All right. All right. I'm

595
02:43:29,430 --> 02:43:33,370
going to give one more attempt. I said I was only going to stream for like, like three hours today.

596
02:43:33,370 --> 02:43:43,860
So let's, let's get back to it. I would, I would. The edits of that to various scenes would be

597
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:55,459
fucking gold. I think it would be really funny. I'm getting booed. Three hour stream. Yeah. Three

598
02:43:55,459 --> 02:44:03,860
hour stream. Your light is on. Oh, it's, no, it's off. I think I just, the color corrected the camera.

599
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:09,159
All right. Let me, I'm not messing around. Let's actually go for it. I'm going to try to win.

600
02:44:09,159 --> 02:44:19,559
I'm going to try to actually do it. Peewee dance. Liar. Go back in front of the green screen. Okay.

601
02:44:19,559 --> 02:44:25,049
What if, what if I go back in front of the green screen and just sit facing a movie theater? Like

602
02:44:25,049 --> 02:44:29,129
as if I'm facing a, you know, the projector's behind me and I'm sitting there and I just keep

603
02:44:29,129 --> 02:44:33,610
looking back and keep talking to you and stuff. Like you're, you're sitting next to me or sitting

604
02:44:33,610 --> 02:44:43,850
behind me. And not like MST 3K. More like I'm just your annoying friend and I'm just reacting

605
02:44:43,850 --> 02:45:01,180
to the movie that I don't know what it is. Okay. All right. Just, just public domain. You know,

606
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:07,190
here's the thing, here's the thing though. That's a galaxy brand idea. You would crack up in five

607
02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:14,299
minutes. No, I would, I would be dedicated to it. It would have to be exactly, or how about this?

608
02:45:14,379 --> 02:45:22,809
I got an even better idea. I react to a movie that you do not know. And you have to figure out

609
02:45:22,809 --> 02:45:33,430
what movie I'm actually reacting to. And I don't give you very many hints. I think that's kind of

610
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:52,659
fun too. How come this guy talks so much? Um, it's my, one of my only skills is talking well.

611
02:45:52,659 --> 02:46:03,379
And sometimes I don't even do that very good. Bro, this is what? I'm good. I'm good. I've got

612
02:46:03,379 --> 02:46:12,170
plenty of skills. Don't worry. Green screen was bad. I could do it more than once. Who cares?

613
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:18,360
I also have that video that I'm working on that I'm just going to premiere it on stream. And I

614
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:23,159
might not even upload it anywhere. Imagine him reacting as if it's the Mario movie and someone

615
02:46:23,159 --> 02:46:30,579
puts it over saw. Well, here's the thing. It would have to just be for fun only because you guys

616
02:46:30,579 --> 02:46:37,700
wouldn't be able to upload it anywhere. That's like, you know, copyright infringement DMCA shit.

617
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:42,420
You can't just upload an entire movie with me in the corner. That's just not how that works.

618
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:49,129
So, I mean, maybe just for fun for you just to kind of put on whatever. I don't know. Dude,

619
02:46:49,129 --> 02:46:57,530
it didn't even be Yahoo yet. The Truman cut. Well, the Truman show cut was essentially the, I was,

620
02:46:57,530 --> 02:47:03,299
I was in every scene replacing actors and stuff. This would just be me in the corner watching

621
02:47:03,299 --> 02:47:14,069
the movie. You can't do that on any platform. You can't do that. What about the peewee promise?

622
02:47:14,069 --> 02:47:18,569
All right, I'm going to play the game now. I'm going to go one or two more solid tries and then

623
02:47:18,569 --> 02:47:33,659
we'll call it there. Short stream today. Short stream. He loves lying. I don't love lying. I love

624
02:47:33,659 --> 02:47:43,129
making up shit. That's lying. It's coming up with weird ideas lying by its very nature. It's like

625
02:47:43,129 --> 02:47:50,540
making up shit. I like to make up scenarios. I like to make up stuff, make up like stories and

626
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:58,219
characters and stuff. I am a, am I just a liar by trade? That's just a, is that a story? I'm

627
02:47:58,219 --> 02:48:16,549
not a liar. I'm a storyteller. This part of the movie is so sad. I'm not lying. I'm just making

628
02:48:16,549 --> 02:48:29,180
shit up. All right. Let's try. Both headphones going in. Nice piano music. No copyright,

629
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:32,700
except the whole stream is coming down anyways, because the whole stream has been copyright

630
02:48:32,700 --> 02:48:49,209
music, but whatever. This one's nice. You sound like a super villain. I'm just a guy. I'm just a

631
02:48:49,209 --> 02:49:03,770
guy. Stop jumping up and down on the same wall over and over again. Play the game. Play the game.

632
02:49:03,770 --> 02:49:31,590
Oh, that is the right way. He's just, just a silly, a silly little guy. You have a terrible

633
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:41,989
tension span. You don't have the attention span of a, this is actually kind of intense. I don't

634
02:49:41,989 --> 02:49:53,879
have the attention span of a regular guy. I, I'm just a regular guy. How do I fix hip pain? I don't

635
02:49:53,879 --> 02:50:03,850
know. A lot of my pain problems are up here and like the sternum. I would go to a doctor. I don't

636
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:17,930
have very much I can tell you. Sorry. Unfortunately, your heart, uh, no, it's more sternum.

637
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:25,219
I had my heart checked and it was fine. I, dude, I had every, every single system in my whole body

638
02:50:25,219 --> 02:50:40,969
was checked when I took that break in 2020. Oh, I was like, what's going, what's this competing?

639
02:50:41,530 --> 02:50:55,590
All right. I'm going to try to keep a straight face while I do this, but it's going to be really

640
02:50:55,590 --> 02:51:07,850
difficult. I'm putting on three or four different piano royalty free tracks. They're just going to

641
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:11,940
be competing. Imagine being at a bar or like a club or something and like a lounge.

642
02:51:13,959 --> 02:51:18,200
This is like three people on pianos. By the way, can we talk about this for one second? I know

643
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:23,819
I'm supposed to be playing the game, but who cares? Did we already talk about who, why the

644
02:51:23,819 --> 02:51:30,250
fuck would you have a P like a big grand piano in your house? You know, like, oh, well, I have

645
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:44,069
a big piano. We already talked about this. Did we do that? Did I talk about pianos yet? No. Okay.

646
02:51:44,069 --> 02:51:48,889
All right. So when you have a house, like you still say you buy a house. It's like, oh yeah,

647
02:51:48,889 --> 02:51:53,670
I got a house now. Okay. Yeah, I got a house. You know what I really, really want in a room in the

648
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:59,780
house? Just a giant fucking piano. I don't, but if you don't play it, I don't know how many people

649
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:07,159
play those pianos. Like, oh, the, the paint on the wall. Maybe I'll change the floors. Maybe I'll

650
02:52:07,159 --> 02:52:20,010
redesign one of the rooms. Grand piano. If you don't play, if you're not a pianist, they take up,

651
02:52:20,010 --> 02:52:24,170
they take up an entire, they take up like a huge amount of square footage in a house.

652
02:52:24,250 --> 02:52:41,479
A pianist. You immature little bastards. All right, let's go. It's a pianist.

653
02:52:43,159 --> 02:52:52,170
I'm not saying it again, but I've never once in my whole life been like, you know, I really looking

654
02:52:52,170 --> 02:53:23,190
like I want a big grand piano in that room. I forget how to play the game. Everyone stop.

655
02:53:23,190 --> 02:53:24,870
Can I do my stupid little routine now?

656
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:30,040
But don't be afraid. You can always repeat. You learn from our mistakes.

657
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:42,309
I like your Batman hair. Ludwig beat this game. Ludwig beat this game. How long did it take Ludwig

658
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:58,329
to beat this? How long did it take Ludwig to do this? Nine hours? Eight hours? What the fuck?

659
02:53:58,329 --> 02:54:12,260
How? Did Stur beat this? Oh, the piano songs. All right, here we go. This is going to be unbearable.

660
02:54:12,819 --> 02:54:18,569
This is just one of those streams. Vinny, did Vinny beat it too? Who, who, whatever. All right,

661
02:54:18,569 --> 02:54:24,500
this is going to be awful, but I don't care. I'm just imagining like three people

662
02:54:25,479 --> 02:54:28,760
and different pianos all trying to play different music over each other. All right,

663
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:35,860
we'll see if this is funny. This one's called soft piano music. All right, let's try it.

664
02:54:35,860 --> 02:55:25,579
Here we go. No laughing, straight face only. This is just what it was like inside of every

665
02:55:25,579 --> 02:55:36,069
Radio Shack in America. Every single Radio Shack in America sounded like this. Every one of them.

666
02:55:36,069 --> 02:56:04,489
It's just people like playing keyboards in every aisle. I can't fucking do it anymore.

667
02:56:04,489 --> 02:56:18,629
We're going to leave one of them on. More, more pianos. You're going to crash my computer.

668
02:56:18,629 --> 02:57:10,020
My computer's hanging right now. Once I have eight open, I'm done. This sounds like someone's

669
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:28,579
shit face playing the piano. Like they're good, but they've had like eight cocktails. Okay,

670
02:57:28,579 --> 02:58:02,549
last one. I can't do more than this. This is like when an orchestra is about to start actually

671
02:58:02,549 --> 02:58:08,729
playing a song. They all like play at the same time. And then it's like, it kind of sounds

672
02:58:08,729 --> 02:58:20,870
fucking weird. And then they stop. All right, that's enough. I'm going. No emotion. Add a

673
02:58:20,870 --> 02:59:14,059
cheering soundtrack too. Like it's like a stadium. Stadium cheering sounds. One hour. I forgot where

674
02:59:14,059 --> 02:59:52,629
to go. All right. Add car driving sounds. Wait, it's picking up. I've heard this one before.

675
02:59:59,110 --> 03:00:14,729
One of them. It's Club Penguin. That's what it is. I feel like I'm going to have a nightmare

676
03:00:14,729 --> 03:01:13,219
later tonight. They're not happy anymore. They're not happy. Oh shit. Then they're very unhappy.

677
03:01:13,219 --> 03:01:25,030
I keep closing tabs and it's still going. You know, I think about like, man, like our youth today,

678
03:01:25,030 --> 03:01:31,350
like all these crazy videos and Tik Tok and all like the big brain rot and stuff. Look what I

679
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:41,459
just did to all of you. You know what I mean? Like all the youth today, all the consuming

680
03:01:41,540 --> 03:01:46,500
Tik Tok videos. I'm going to play 10 piano sound effects with cheering and booing and

681
03:01:46,500 --> 03:02:09,020
farting and screaming sounds. It's me too. It's me too. I kind of miss it. And only a thousand

682
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:26,709
people left. That's actually kind of surprising. I don't know why I'm going for like a high score.

683
03:02:26,709 --> 03:02:34,620
Okay. Let's try it for real. No jokey shit. No bullshit. I got it. All right. Tell me the truth.

684
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:43,799
No messing around. Did I do a good job as high as I got? I got to pretty much where the balloons are.

685
03:02:43,799 --> 03:02:49,059
Did I do a good job? Did I do all right? I think I did okay. I actually surprised I got as high as

686
03:02:49,059 --> 03:03:00,329
I did. That one crane kind of, when I fell off the crane all the way up where the balloons are,

687
03:03:00,329 --> 03:03:05,049
that's when the pianos were starting to play in my head. It was just like, oh shit, it's over.

688
03:03:05,049 --> 03:03:18,170
But we're good. I'm having fun. That's like 15% of the way through the game. It's true. I did say I

689
03:03:18,170 --> 03:03:36,940
was going to try to get past 10%. Charlie Speed runs this game. I want to watch that. I feel like

690
03:03:36,940 --> 03:03:54,200
that's very interesting to see. Put on club. Okay, we're good. Please, subway surfers. No.

691
03:04:10,540 --> 03:04:22,299
Charlie's life. Is Charlie, is he playing it right now? How much further than me is he right now?

692
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:42,940
Like 5%. Those bits sapped him of all of his energy. Yeah, they kind of did.

693
03:04:42,940 --> 03:05:02,139
Too many like funny sound effects. Is your discomfort? I just want to, I want to get back up

694
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:07,909
I'm going to try one more time. Somebody said funny in quotes.

695
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:20,329
Yeah, I'll allow that. I will allow that. That doesn't mean I'm going to not.

696
03:05:21,659 --> 03:05:26,139
No, I'm not going to time you up. No, I'm going to be nice today.

697
03:05:26,700 --> 03:05:34,700
No music. I'll turn the actual sounds back up though.

698
03:05:35,899 --> 03:06:04,459
I think I just fell off. Okay, back to normal. Geez. This is fun though. See what I mean? See

699
03:06:04,459 --> 03:06:13,899
what I mean? That's happened a few times in a bad spot. Risk on. Maybe when we get up a little

700
03:06:13,899 --> 03:06:27,610
higher. Please put public domain movies in the corner. All right, so you can go like this on

701
03:06:27,610 --> 03:06:33,270
your iPad and just zoom in on that movie and not even watch the stream anymore. Now you're,

702
03:06:33,270 --> 03:06:50,940
I'm here right now. You know what's crazy? The part coming up here with all those little

703
03:06:50,940 --> 03:06:55,940
jumps, the really, really scary ones. I flawlessly executed, but then I'll just fall off the edge

704
03:06:55,940 --> 03:07:13,020
over here. Weird. Subway servers, please. A public domain movie instead of a face cam.

705
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:33,620
I actually like that idea. That's funny. That's very humorous. All right. If I get across this,

706
03:07:40,389 --> 03:08:11,450
don't go fast. This is my last attempt. So do it right. Oh my God. I'm so I guess with repetition,

707
03:08:11,450 --> 03:08:18,420
you kind of just burn into muscle memory, how to do all this stuff. I do wish. I mean,

708
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:28,020
I'm a checkpoint, Andy. I like checkpoints. It's also possible that I haven't come across

709
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:48,420
a checkpoint because I haven't gotten far enough. That's very possible. Oh my goodness. I didn't

710
03:08:48,420 --> 03:08:55,500
grab onto anything, but I'm so good. All right. The worst is here. This is like technically one

711
03:08:55,500 --> 03:09:22,090
of the worst parts. Slow it down and get it right and good. Right here. All right. This part sucks.

712
03:09:22,729 --> 03:09:27,049
Every time I get here, I look and I kind of gulp like a cartoon because it's always stressful.

713
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:46,569
It's very easy to screw this up. Did you see the new spider verse? I did not.

714
03:09:47,209 --> 03:09:57,690
I want to though. I want to. Careful. Get it right. I've done this jump like five times now.

715
03:09:58,329 --> 03:10:23,450
No reason to overthink it. This part is the worst because I always feel like I'm not going to make

716
03:10:23,450 --> 03:10:41,860
it, but somehow I just do every time. Scary. Okay. Almost at the industrial area. That's the

717
03:10:41,860 --> 03:10:58,760
hardest jump of this whole map. Actually might be this one here. All right. Oh, I just scared

718
03:10:58,760 --> 03:11:35,290
the shit out of somebody, but I scared the shit out of myself. So we both got scared. Okay. That

719
03:11:35,290 --> 03:11:44,379
one is deceiving because it's really not that it's really not hard. It just looks hard. All right.

720
03:11:44,379 --> 03:12:03,049
Breather. Jeez, dude. What are you doing? Okay. The last couple of times this is this has been a

721
03:12:03,049 --> 03:12:09,350
disaster. The last couple of times I was here, I have progressed like 30 minutes ahead of this.

722
03:12:10,069 --> 03:12:37,219
For some reason, it's this stupid area right here. Up there is what I'm talking about. This

723
03:12:37,219 --> 03:12:57,290
part's kind of hard too, but just be careful. Not that big of a deal. Really not. You got further in

724
03:12:57,290 --> 03:13:01,959
10 minutes than I did in three hours. Well, I've been streaming for three hours and I've been

725
03:13:01,959 --> 03:13:18,540
streaming this game for three hours. So we are at the same spot. Think about it. This is what

726
03:13:18,540 --> 03:13:29,239
screwed me up last time and it was fine. What happened the last time I got there? Honestly,

727
03:13:29,239 --> 03:14:03,540
what happened? You lagged out. I'm almost at the awful jump that screwed me up last time. I might

728
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:11,239
not even do it. I might just sit. If I stay on it, it'll throw me off though, won't it? It'll throw

729
03:14:11,239 --> 03:14:27,829
me off. You don't jump off the platform. Won't it toss me? It won't. I feel like it like threw me

730
03:14:27,829 --> 03:14:35,370
last time. Or am I just crazy? It will not toss you. You need to jump. Well, that's what I tried.

731
03:14:35,370 --> 03:14:57,399
I tried to jump last time and it just kind of like, don't jump yet. God. Okay. Well, here we go.

732
03:14:57,399 --> 03:15:12,120
You've got to be shitting me. Thank goodness. I hit the wire. God damn it. That's the end of

733
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:53,399
I better not be soft-locked. Okay. We're good. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it because

734
03:15:53,399 --> 03:16:04,149
I didn't think I was good. Well, I thought I was good. So we're good. This part is freaking me out

735
03:16:04,149 --> 03:16:15,379
though. I've gotten here two, three other times and just falling off. Yeah. You fell off. Yeah.

736
03:16:15,379 --> 03:16:27,319
I know. It's whatever. Yeah. You peeked at Shpee. I know. I've heard it all before. A little bit of

737
03:16:27,319 --> 03:16:36,569
Shpee. A little bit of Shpee. That's one of my favorite streams just because I've said it a

738
03:16:36,569 --> 03:16:41,500
million times, but I'm going to reiterate it over and over again. It's just like that. I say that

739
03:16:41,500 --> 03:16:47,530
all the time, right? I say that all the time. Those actors were given just like a little

740
03:16:47,530 --> 03:16:54,100
20 minute package of things to study and like, Ooh, hot cup of cider. As if those are my catch

741
03:16:54,100 --> 03:17:05,590
phrases. Ooh, Shpee. I haven't said that in nine years. I love that so much. They got such a small

742
03:17:05,590 --> 03:17:14,340
window of what like I've done in 12 years that like most of it was from like 2012. Perfect. I

743
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:33,659
love it. Okay. Here we go. Don't hit the wire. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. We're back

744
03:17:33,659 --> 03:17:47,879
and another 10, 20 feet or so. And I'm, I'm game progress. Well, more like a hundred feet. I got

745
03:17:47,879 --> 03:18:09,719
way higher than this last time. This is a weird thing. I did this. This part was a little weird,

746
03:18:09,719 --> 03:18:17,239
but I'll be good. Just do it slow. There's no reason to go risk on right now. Holy shit. I

747
03:18:17,239 --> 03:18:43,479
almost didn't get it. This is where I failed. That's I know what happened. I know what happened.

748
03:18:43,479 --> 03:18:48,600
Why did I fall? I know what happened though. Stupid. Oh my God. Those little things that look

749
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:53,799
sick. That's true. That's a kaizo block. That's a fucking kaizo block. You got to be fucking

750
03:18:53,799 --> 03:18:58,780
shitting me. That's a kaizo block. There's like a little thing on the ground and it makes you

751
03:18:58,780 --> 03:19:10,489
fucking just walk off. It's a kaizo block. You're going to be shitting me. There is like a little

752
03:19:10,489 --> 03:19:17,940
tiny staple on that thing that just pushes you off. If you walk into it as annoying,

753
03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:25,290
I'm annoyed now. I didn't walk off. Go clip it. Go look at it. The things collision is as big as

754
03:19:25,930 --> 03:19:34,819
10 people's feet. I'm annoyed now. You have to jump over those or they just push you off. Now

755
03:19:34,819 --> 03:19:53,700
I know that and I'm pissed. Come on. You got like six inches to walk and there's a little

756
03:19:53,700 --> 03:20:00,020
staple sticking out of the ground will push you off the map. You have to jump. There's three of

757
03:20:00,020 --> 03:20:06,659
them. I saw them. I even said to myself, I was like, that thing is weird and sticking out of

758
03:20:06,659 --> 03:20:31,049
the ground and I walked into it and kaizo block die. Well, now I know. Now I know that the

759
03:20:32,090 --> 03:20:39,110
little fucking speed bump sticking out of the ground, the little like it's a little tiny little

760
03:20:39,110 --> 03:21:05,030
thing. If you touch it, if you walk into it, it's just what the fuck I was and that's what happened

761
03:21:05,030 --> 03:21:10,520
last time and I was confused last time too. I was like, why did I, why did I fall off? Why did my

762
03:21:10,520 --> 03:21:16,340
character walk off the edge? And now I know a little staple. Oh, I could, I could repeat myself

763
03:21:16,340 --> 03:21:26,170
a hundred times. That didn't happen in the third time. I'm getting up there just to just to fucking

764
03:21:26,170 --> 03:21:45,000
fight this game. Walking over a speed bump. I mean, no proof, Andy. I didn't walk off of it. I

765
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:55,559
literally, it pushed me off of the fucking thing. I'm watching it right now. That's, I know what

766
03:21:55,559 --> 03:22:00,920
happened. I'm telling you right now. Why would I walk off the edge like that? You've seen me walk

767
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:07,420
on. I just put, I just, my character just fucking went over the edge. I promise you,

768
03:22:09,290 --> 03:22:15,190
there's no reason why I would have done that. You've seen me walk on smaller ledges than that.

769
03:22:15,190 --> 03:22:23,350
Oh, hey, I'm at the area. That is like, I got to it. I was really happy I got back to the area. Let

770
03:22:23,350 --> 03:22:43,799
me walk off the edge now. Let me just like walk sideways. You should have adjusted. I'm going to

771
03:22:44,440 --> 03:22:49,590
wait till you play it and you're going to, you're going to have the same Larry David response that

772
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:55,100
I had. You're going to go, that stream is an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.

773
03:22:55,100 --> 03:23:01,020
You're going to walk right over it and then you're going to go, and then the fucking music's

774
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:35,180
going to play and then you're going to understand. That was the best Larry David impression I've

775
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:52,069
ever heard. It wasn't really an impression. It was a noise. It was a sound effect. Oh, that,

776
03:23:52,069 --> 03:23:58,889
and it's so hard. The little staples sticking out of the ground is what they're, you gotta be

777
03:23:58,889 --> 03:24:09,750
fucking kidding me. I was at the same exact spot. I was three, two hours ago, two hours ago. I was

778
03:24:09,750 --> 03:24:37,909
right there. I'm furious right now. Fucking staple. Happy father's day. Happy father's day to all

779
03:24:37,909 --> 03:24:45,540
you fathers. If there's any fathers here that includes dog dads too, by the way, that includes

780
03:24:45,540 --> 03:25:14,309
dog dads. Okay. Actually last attempt. I've done this so many times that I can just do it now

781
03:25:14,309 --> 03:25:50,870
without a problem. I think I can just make this jump right here. Do this thing. Look at that thing.

782
03:25:50,870 --> 03:26:37,209
Watch this buddy. I was about to go risk on, but yeah. Okay. Sunk cost fallacy. I would agree with

783
03:26:37,209 --> 03:26:46,379
you if I didn't get back there a second time. Me getting back to that spot a second time means I

784
03:26:46,379 --> 03:27:03,610
can get back to it a third time. And now I know about the kaizo block. So I'm prepared now. This

785
03:27:03,610 --> 03:27:09,180
is the hardest part of this area. I'm ready to go. Ready to rock and roll. Just do it. I've done it.

786
03:27:09,180 --> 03:27:15,079
I've not fallen off of this the last four or five times I've been here. So just keep at it. Keep it

787
03:27:15,079 --> 03:27:38,309
going. It didn't jump. It didn't even, it didn't jump. I just like fucking slid off. I jumped in

788
03:27:38,309 --> 03:27:58,780
it just so he just didn't do it. I've made that jump five times in a row. It's like your feet,

789
03:27:58,780 --> 03:28:10,540
your feet are their own physics objects. Look at this. And they like, you're a weak kid. Go back

790
03:28:10,540 --> 03:28:30,569
to the favelas. I didn't fall all the way. That means we do it again. It's not that far. It's not

791
03:28:30,569 --> 03:28:46,059
far. It's right there. The elephant just upset him. You can tell. That was my fault too, right?

792
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:06,819
I'm fine. Put the fucking piano music back on. Right. Scream. What's a good thing to try one

793
03:29:06,819 --> 03:29:41,909
more time? SimCity SNES. That sounds kind of good. How about Bill Collins? Final Fantasy

794
03:29:41,909 --> 03:29:49,959
battle themes. How about the Final Fantasy 16 battle theme? That one has been stuck in my head

795
03:29:49,959 --> 03:30:02,229
for, it won't go away. It will not go away. I can't get rid of it. So I'm going to do it now. Great.

796
03:30:02,229 --> 03:30:13,510
I love it. What a fake fan. Final Fantasy. I love it. Yes. I haven't played a Final Fantasy in 20

797
03:30:13,510 --> 03:30:24,760
years. Hey, it's really good. I really like it. I'm looking forward to playing it. How could you

798
03:30:24,760 --> 03:30:33,299
not like this? Yeah. All the Batchesters. Yeah. Oh, did y'all, sorry. Are you getting a little

799
03:30:33,299 --> 03:30:52,250
pumped up right now? Is that what's happening? I'm going risk on the entire run here. I'm not

800
03:30:52,250 --> 03:31:46,969
going risk off ever again. Somebody's playing the game. Oh, no, no, no. That's the industry

801
03:31:46,969 --> 03:31:51,829
thing right there. I thought somebody recorded the in-game footage.

802
03:34:48,569 --> 03:35:00,409
All right. Final Fantasy 16. Releasing on June 22nd for the Sony Station 5.

803
03:35:08,100 --> 03:35:18,409
And you might be able to see German 985 play Final Fantasy 16 on June 22nd yourself. Oh, it's gone.

804
03:35:20,809 --> 03:36:11,530
I miss it. Final Fantasy 6 battle theme. You know what? Oh, Mario Galaxy is a good one.

805
03:36:11,530 --> 03:36:19,059
That's a good one. I have a major crit- You want to hear my criticism of the Mario movie?

806
03:36:19,059 --> 03:36:31,190
Here it is. It's all a Mario movie. I'm going to give you a three sentence take. The Mario franchise

807
03:36:31,190 --> 03:36:45,159
has so many songs that they could remix and stuff. A lot of the musical tracks of that movie are like

808
03:36:45,159 --> 03:36:59,209
Take me on. Take on me. You're watching a movie. It's just you're watching a movie.

809
03:36:59,209 --> 03:37:15,739
You're watching a movie. Here's a movie. All right. Let me put it on. I was waiting for this

810
03:37:16,459 --> 03:37:25,750
and it was just like a licensed movie soundtrack stuff. Every time it would do a licensed like

811
03:37:25,750 --> 03:37:31,659
rock song. I'm just like, I'm watching a movie. This is a movie. Hey, honey, honey, this is a movie.

812
03:37:44,860 --> 03:37:48,700
Now I, I know it's a movie, but like I, it's almost like I'm being reminded that,

813
03:37:49,420 --> 03:37:58,180
that I'm watching a movie. This is not the one I want. Where's the, where's the one? You know,

814
03:37:58,180 --> 03:38:04,889
you know the one. This one. They could have just played this for an hour and 40 minutes in the

815
03:38:04,889 --> 03:38:10,329
background the whole movie and I would have been probably happier. Don't you think so? Like this

816
03:38:10,329 --> 03:38:26,549
could have just been in the background for an hour and 20 minutes. Should I gotta go?

817
03:38:26,549 --> 03:39:47,750
Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. No, not yet. Oh, also, is it a shit take to say that? I don't

818
03:39:47,750 --> 03:40:01,989
think Chris Pratt did a bad job. Is that, is that a shit take? Is that a shit take? I was like,

819
03:40:01,989 --> 03:40:10,680
I was sitting there being like, I can't, I can't, I just, I can't, this sucks. It's all right. This

820
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:17,989
is okay. This is okay. This is fine. Yeah, I'm okay with this. I'm all right with this. It's all

821
03:40:17,989 --> 03:40:26,149
right. Yeah, this is cool. Better than what I expected. Yeah, I, I thought it was, I thought

822
03:40:26,149 --> 03:40:37,739
it was all right. What do you say? You've been what? You've been extra hairy lately. Um, yeah,

823
03:40:37,739 --> 03:40:54,180
it's all right. All right, let's put the music back on. All right, now here it comes. I think.

824
03:40:54,819 --> 03:41:06,329
Aren't you doing the be as gross as possible challenge? Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

825
03:41:07,780 --> 03:41:27,420
This is the, okay, this is the one I'm talking about. Yes, it is. I'll turn it up for you. All

826
03:41:27,420 --> 03:41:32,629
right, I'm turning it up for you guys. Let's just vibe out right now. What do you think? What do you

827
03:41:32,629 --> 03:42:36,579
say? This time I'm getting there. You fucking beautiful. Why are you not streaming in 1080p?

828
03:42:36,579 --> 03:43:25,420
Um, my computer sucks. I'm on an i3. Sorry, sorry. Hey buddy, we meet again. Oh, it's a bug. It's a

829
03:43:25,420 --> 03:43:28,540
bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug.

830
03:43:28,540 --> 03:43:33,420
It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's an actual bug. It's

831
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:44,969
an actual bug. It's a bug. It's a fucking bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug in the game.

832
03:43:44,969 --> 03:43:57,350
It's a bug. It just it just pushes you off. It makes you fall off. It's a bug. Is it a bug? I don't

833
03:43:57,350 --> 03:44:03,670
know, dude. You've been fucked up by my whole body yards. I can't even walk over here. See what I'm

834
03:44:03,670 --> 03:44:26,780
talking about? It's a bug. Do I have to use the bed? Is this intended? Oh shit. Stop. Stop. It's a

835
03:44:26,780 --> 03:44:34,170
guys. It's I didn't do anything. This this this area is fucked up. I'm telling you right now this

836
03:44:34,170 --> 03:44:45,700
area is fucked up. It wouldn't let me stand on it. It was just like pushing me off. See what I'm

837
03:44:45,700 --> 03:45:04,360
saying? What's happening here? It won't let me land on it. You're going the wrong way. What do you

838
03:45:04,360 --> 03:45:14,700
mean I'm going the wrong way? You have to jump to the cement blocks. What are you talking about?

839
03:45:14,700 --> 03:45:23,079
What do you mean? You mean up here? What do you mean? I'm slowly doing a split and this looks

840
03:45:23,079 --> 03:45:33,180
very painful. The gray things in front of you. Um this is gonna start to hurt. To the balloons?

841
03:45:33,180 --> 03:45:48,520
Where are the balloons? What do you mean that way? I'm so confused and I can't move. I'm gonna pause

842
03:45:48,520 --> 03:46:07,059
it. Jump over here? Yeah but I can't travel that far. You talking about right here or down? No.

843
03:46:07,059 --> 03:46:16,219
What do you mean? You've been going the wrong way? Just the rectangles by the no down down down down

844
03:46:16,219 --> 03:46:28,180
there down wait down here. I don't know. That's where I just was. I was just here in this building.

845
03:46:28,180 --> 03:46:56,819
Wait what? So this is just bait? This was bait? I don't think I can move. I'm in the thriller pose.

846
03:46:56,819 --> 03:47:52,200
All right. Fuck. My balloons! Okay I'm fine. Am I all right? Yeah I'm fine. Everybody relax.

847
03:48:00,020 --> 03:48:06,840
I'm a tuber tonight so this is like the most tuber I've been. This is probably the most tuber I have

848
03:48:06,840 --> 03:48:27,030
been in like probably two or three years. Okay I gotta get up there and jump off of that. That's

849
03:48:27,030 --> 03:50:21,159
the best way to get up there. Like what I was just doing. My balloons! I gotta get down. My balloons!

850
03:50:24,920 --> 03:50:30,200
What a person really needs is not a state of peace but the striving and fighting for some worthy goal.

851
03:50:31,159 --> 03:50:39,079
Fuck all that. I don't even know. I don't know what they said but I'm talking about the cinder

852
03:50:39,079 --> 03:51:26,250
blocks. Risk on. It did it. I actually didn't go that far. I think I can get back up there.

853
03:51:30,100 --> 03:51:34,569
You jacked too hard. I went right in the middle of all of them.

854
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:56,299
Shit. I'm not upset. I'm not that far. That's not a reset moment. I'm right here. This is not that far.

855
03:51:56,299 --> 03:52:17,899
All the annoying shit is done already. I'm so... This music is the only thing keeping me from

856
03:52:17,899 --> 03:52:26,649
screaming. Fuck as loud as I can. It's just like all right okay a little star is flying around and

857
03:52:27,290 --> 03:52:53,579
they all go like it's it's cute and okay I'm I'm fine it's cute I made it to the balloons

858
03:52:53,579 --> 03:53:02,540
I'm happy no matter what happens when I was all the way down there looking up I did not think

859
03:53:02,540 --> 03:53:10,309
I didn't think I was gonna get to the balloons but I wanted to I'll take that as a win you should

860
03:53:10,309 --> 03:53:20,760
stream Mario Galaxy uh maybe we will that sounds like fun if I get to the balloons then I'll be

861
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:25,739
really happy like actually staying where the balloons are we're already right there we're

862
03:53:25,739 --> 03:53:38,780

866
03:55:02,729 --> 03:55:08,219
much where I was before there's no reason to get angry or annoyed I really haven't even been that

867
03:55:08,219 --> 03:55:13,620
angry I got angry at a system that I thought was like kaizo blocking me but it just I went the

868
03:55:13,620 --> 03:55:31,370
wrong way and I was hitting invisible developer walls so that's my own fault you influenced Vinny

869
03:55:31,370 --> 03:55:38,139
to check out this game because you streamed it didn't Vinny play this already wasn't Vinny

870

871
03:55:46,979 --> 03:56:03,059
Vinny beat this oh I see what's going on I get it I was explicitly told that Vinny

872
03:56:03,139 --> 03:56:21,590
beat the game always scary grabbing this one I just had to go left that's so funny and I

873
03:56:21,590 --> 03:56:36,389
was sitting there just just seething and just complaining I just went the wrong way what's the

874
03:56:36,389 --> 03:56:47,530
best way to get up from here wait do I have to use the bed is there a way to get oh no we're

875
03:56:58,200 --> 03:57:07,420
hey you tell Vinny you tell Vinny that balloon berry you tell Vinny that balloon berry is is

the final fantasy 16 battle music again is that is that weird you care uh it's gonna go that way

883
03:59:41,450 --> 04:00:02,760
or that it's probably gonna go over here I'm gonna take my time because stream is getting

884
04:00:02,760 --> 04:00:07,450
close to being over I mean I'm either gonna beat it or I'm just gonna get to wherever

885
04:00:07,530 --> 04:00:33,370
I get to on like the thermometer going up cell caliber Vinny's watching the clip it was so

886
04:00:33,370 --> 04:00:46,600
stressful Vinny spoilers don't Vinny spoilers hmm this is important because this has to keep

887
04:00:46,600 --> 04:00:55,049
me going because this is uncharted territory I don't know where I am it's got to be something

888

really good oh my goodness that is true uh snake eater the one that goes

889
04:01:16,379 --> 04:01:20,250

890
04:01:20,889 --> 04:01:35,000
that's a really good one no that's that's from five that's not from three

891
04:01:43,620 --> 04:01:52,860

892
04:02:21,979 --> 04:02:47,049
I just something fell

893
04:03:00,579 --> 04:03:04,729
from

894
04:03:32,659 --> 04:04:25,399
not gonna fool me with that bullshit that song is great blood-borne now blood-borne now blood-borne

895
04:04:25,399 --> 04:04:46,709
now Ludwig's theme oh yeah I listened to I listened to this all people are so talented

896
04:04:46,709 --> 04:04:57,639
isn't it interesting it's like humans are able to create so many things isn't that cool what we

897
04:04:57,639 --> 04:05:11,459
are capable of doing on this fucking planet all right this is a stressful part and I'm gonna let

898
04:05:11,459 --> 04:05:25,340
the because I usually just skip right to the Ludwig part what do you think did we listen to

899
04:05:25,340 --> 04:05:31,030
the whole thing okay let it build let it build I that means I can't fall for six minutes all right

900
04:05:31,670 --> 04:07:02,090
it's gonna get loud can I stand on that oh my god oh yes you are on my side all along my true mentor

901
04:07:02,889 --> 04:07:11,819
my guiding moonlight it's not the right part of the track anything to make you cope

902
04:07:12,459 --> 04:07:20,629
with what you're doing I got it wrong there's a little more I jumped the gun a little

903
04:08:07,510 --> 04:09:02,979
Jesus that's why I went slow oh yes bugleberry can I walk on that what do I jump

904
04:09:02,979 --> 04:09:16,020
can I walk on this here it comes

905
04:09:46,020 --> 04:09:57,110
sorry I I can't hear your donation sorry oh

906
04:09:59,579 --> 04:10:06,459
that's completely missed I completely missed it I completely missed it I completely missed it

907
04:10:06,459 --> 04:10:32,100
I completely missed it I completely missed it what the fuck no

908
04:10:43,940 --> 04:11:14,420
I thought it was much further and I had I was holding shift

909
04:11:14,420 --> 04:11:40,700
and that I oh one more oh it's so far at least I did it to the music I you know what it was it was

910
04:11:40,700 --> 04:11:46,649
the perspective when running up I thought it was much further that's just a regular jump but

911
04:11:46,649 --> 04:11:53,799
honestly a regular jump probably would have gone over to a regular jump would have probably gone

912
04:11:53,799 --> 04:12:07,909
over to that's like a jump I don't know it's deceiving damn it oh I'm all right with that

913
04:12:08,549 --> 04:12:17,659
a few spider verse jumped shit you're so red right now because I'm just like all that energy

914
04:12:17,659 --> 04:12:27,670
just like expelled all right yeah no I think that's a place to call it I don't know if I'll

915
04:12:27,670 --> 04:12:36,549
reliably get back up there I'm okay with that that was fun though that's a really fun game

916
04:12:36,549 --> 04:12:50,969
I had it I all right now that's it I was only gonna stream for like three hours today anyways
