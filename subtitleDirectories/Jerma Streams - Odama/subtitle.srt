1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:12,300
Hey, what's up? How are you? What's going on? What's going on? Oh, it's because the AC is on.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:22,949
Hold on a second. Oh, shit. Uh-oh. Oh, god. What the fuck? Disaster.

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:36,710
What's going on? Is my gate too low right now? Hold on. I'm gonna change this. Give me one second.

4
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:57,590
Is it like fucked up again? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What is going on? Hold on,

5
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:06,069
listen. What? Hold on, I need to like hear this. What the fuck is this? What's this for?

6
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,560
Let me be able to hear it. I can see. Yeah, this is, this is not, you hear that? It's like

7
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:44,500
here. I gotta, okay, hold on. There we go. There we go. That's better. Okay. All right. Perfect.

8
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:55,719
We are back to normal. That was really weird. Okay. So, um, let me turn this down a little bit.

9
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:04,280
Just stop the stream. I'll put the audio back on for you. Okay. Hi, everybody. Welcome. Sorry

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:12,680
about that. That was a quick little change I had to do. Oh, I almost just unplugged my fucking entire

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,240
setup. That would have been so bad. We're gonna do something different today. Well, not really. I feel

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,310
like I'm the guy that has streamed every microphone video game. We're getting close. That's what we're

13
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,639
doing today. We are going to be playing. It's really not that different if you think about it.

14
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,000
We're gonna be playing a game called Old Gama, which, it could be great. It could be awful.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,719
It's a game where you control troops on a battlefield with your voice while you play

16
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:55,270
pinball on the battlefield with a gigantic fucking boulder. So this is either pog or,

17
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:05,960
we'll find out. Let me change back to what I was doing. That's the first thing we're gonna do.

18
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,080
If it turns out this game is really fun and I want to play it forever, then that's what we'll do.

19
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,479
We'll just sit here for a while. But if the game sucks, then we're gonna pivot to Pokemon. That's

20
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:30,819
right. Pokemon. Well, I mean, not necessarily actually Pokemon. I mean, it's a Pokemon game

21
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,219
where you fucking watch TV with your Pokemon friend. It's a TV watching game. So it's not what

22
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:56,340
you think. But, you know, it's Pokemon React. Pokemon React. I can't wait to be like a React

23
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,349
Tuber on the Pokemon game. Anyways, um, oh, wow, this can stay on. Here's the microphone.

24
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:11,560
And here's, I was setting it up to make sure it worked. Hello. Hello. This is a test of the

25
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:19,259
microphone. It seems to be working pretty well. It works pretty well. I got the GameCube controller.

26
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:29,189
I think I'm ready to move. Fake voice. He's peaking his mic. Oh, fuck. No, I don't want to

27
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:36,040
break this. Should I lower it? I don't want to break it. If I break it, I mean, like, it really

28
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,180
fucking matters. There's like four games that utilized the GameCube mic. Two of them are Mario

29
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:50,199
Party. One of them is this. And the other one is a game we've already played, Chibi-Robo. I didn't

30
00:04:50,199 --> 00:05:00,790
even know. I think there's four games that actually use this. Now, this is fine. It's not peaking the

31
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,699
mic. That just means you can hear you very well. How do you use it in Chibi-Robo? I have no idea.

32
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:16,019
I was actually going to look it up. All right, let's go. Can you guys hear this? Why can I not

33
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:29,660
hear this? I should be able to hear this. Oh, there is no sound. Oh, okay. That's like fucking

34
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,019
Resident Evil sound. This is like that. I just thought I was playing Resident Evil. That's the

35
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:43,769
sound it makes when you move items around in Resident Evil 1 and 2. Okay, let's go. I did a

36
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:51,579
little testing to make sure that this is Odama. What's with that? Why is there, what's going on

37
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:58,490
with this? Like the sadness right now. Why is everybody so sad? What's with the sadness?

38
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:12,779
Why are you guys doing sadness? Why are you guys so sad? What's fucking going on here? Oh,

39
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,220
because of the quarantine. Oh yeah, that is true. That's fucking not good.

40
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,389
All right, we'll watch the cut scene. I'll be back in a minute. Is this the opening cut scene?

41
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:39,529
This land has been governed by Lord Yamanouchi Nobatu. When Lord trusted Vassal with, he betrayed

42
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:46,279
him. Lord Yamanouchi took his own life rather than bear the shame of defeat. I feel like I'm

43
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:55,079
a shitty translator at like an event. Okay, and he also says, I can't wait for next year when

44
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:19,689
you all show up. I feel like I'm a shitty translator. I'm getting off the screen. Come back. What's

45
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,730
going on here? There are two secrets that their longtime foes knew nothing about.

46
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:40,519
Well, if this is an actual dub, it'd be more like this. This giant ball was said to have been

47
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:49,079
legend held that when unleashed in battle, the Odama could inflict untold damage to foes or

48
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:57,850
grant great power to allies. But these legends remain untested. The other secret was the doctrine

49
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:05,449
of Nintendo. The word Nintendo is formed from the first kanji of three proverbs. Ninja,

50
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:13,620
Mushin, attend to one's duties. Tenzai, Korin, those in heaven will descend. And Doji, Sumi,

51
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,220
moral action is a da- The way of Ninten illustrates the mindset of the Kagetori army,

52
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,459
soldiers who have entrusted themselves to the heavens. It's going too fast. It's going too fast.

53
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,500
Larry. Larry, I can't keep it up. You're going too fast. Slow the fucking thing down.

54
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,179
Remember the power of the Nintendo?

55
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,179
Dive into the dungeon of Onosamaki and your victory will ring throughout this land.

56
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm gonna bring the can back. Just hold on. We're watching the opening cutscene.

57
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:17,429
You'll play this but not Nioh. Nioh does not have a comedy microphone. If Nioh was controlled with

58
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:27,960
a comedy mic, maybe I would consider it. This looks like a fucking e-cigar. Don't you think

59
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,419
I'm gonna like fucking just go like this and just blow a fucking cloud over here?

60
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:45,750
The e-cigar! Nintendo! Are we done? Wait, wasn't that just- Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:09:47,029 --> 00:10:01,259
Let's go. Okay, I'm ready. Kuruwa Plains. Start. Now my lead. Off to battle. Why do I feel like

62
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,980
this is the Wiimote in the nunchuck? I'm the nunchuck in this scenario. I have to talk.

63
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:14,309
How do I do this? We must first meet our foe on the Plains of Kuruwa. Look closely, my lead.

64
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,409
The plains are bordered by hills and by the rapid flow of the Kuruwa River.

65
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,490
Okay. The enemy attempts to halt our advance at the far bank of the river.

66
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,970
We are to cross- close the floodgate first.

67
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:41,769
This will stop the river. Once the river is blocked, we can cross without fear.

68
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:50,250
Okay, we must ensure that the Ninten Bell passes through the gate at the far end of the field.

69
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,990
When do I use this? Keep as many troops as possible near the Ninten Bell.

70
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,509
As many troops as possible. Oh, almost forgot.

71
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,870
We must win this battle by sundown. Why is there like a Mario fly hat symbol button over there?

72
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:30,059
Hit the ghost by sundown. Hit the floodgate with the odama. All right, so it's right-

73
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,580
three, two, one. All right, here we go. It's fire- wait, it's firing?

74
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:44,409
Move! I'm killing my own troops. Watch out for the ball. I have to have to break the river.

75
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:53,240
Why is it- what am I supposed to do? Where's the ball?

76
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,269
Fall back. Send back up. More troops. I gotta break that. Did I do it?

77
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:14,230
What? You don't have commands? Advance? No, that's- yeah, let's practice, please.

78
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:25,879
Okay. Place the cursor over your men and give them your orders. Clearly into the microphone.

79
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:36,200
It's pinball with extra steps. Is the cursor over your men?

80
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,509
Okay, advance.

81
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:57,129
How do you play with both hands? This is like- this is playing games while eating simulator.

82
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:05,259
You know, you're like- hold on a second. Like, I can't- this is gonna be fucking impossible.

83
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:29,110
Fall back. Fall back. March right. March left. They're going right.

84
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:44,809
Please. Wait. Don't tape it to the- hold on. Don't touch this with my mouth. Did I- did I sanitize

85
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:56,860
this? Oh, it was in- it was in a package. It was in plastic. Okay. I think we're good. It was in

86
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:12,950
brand new- but this is brand new. I'm the first person to put this near their mouth. I lost. Yeah,

87
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:20,019
let's try it again. Wait, the ball went down. I have to start the whole fucking thing over again.

88
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:28,389
All right, I'm ready. Carry the ball through the gate. All right. Oh, I can aim it. Oh, let's go

89
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:37,429
all the way- no, no, no, no. Over here. Try to break that gate. Done. Okay, now I got commands.

90
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:45,830
Here we go. You have learned the command, press forward. The command orders your men to press

91
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,580
forward and repel the enemy. Place your cursor over your men and say, press forward. Your bell

92
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:59,399
crew will summon every last ounce of strength to push through the enemy forces. Will it still hear

93
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:15,379
me if I go like this? My pants are kind of loose. That went all the way down the underwear.

94
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:26,490
That went like straight down over- like to the underwear. Only troops who pass through the gate

95
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,889
will join you at the start of the next battle. Any troops rallied at the bell when you give the

96
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:40,379
order. Wait, okay, so any- you- you- press forward. All right. I have to play like pinball. All right,

97
00:15:40,379 --> 00:16:09,179
just press forward. March left. Press forward. Fuck, I'm so bad at this. Oh, I just killed

98
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:24,580
everybody. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. The floodgate is open. The water is

99
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:32,179
not flowing. What? Press forward. They're coming at me. Can I hit them with the flippers?

100
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:51,460
Advance. Run- crush them. Crush them. Run them over. Advance. Oh my god. Advance. Advance.

101
00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:17,769
I can't trust our liege. What? Advance. Attack. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Yes.

102
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:30,180
Press forward. I'm trying to help you. Tell your men you love them. What just happened?

103
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:40,950
You have- you learned a command called flank and destroy. This thrilling command orders your

104
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,910
troops to engage the enemy. Oh, what the fuck have they been doing this whole time?

105
00:17:44,549 --> 00:18:14,660
Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Okay. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy.

106
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:35,259
Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. I'm killing all my own people. Advance. Advance. Prove we can trust

107
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:56,279
you. What the fuck are you talking about? What? Prove we can trust you first. Okay. What does

108
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:10,650
deploy mean? I- wait. I can- advance. Push forward. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back.

109
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:22,220
Fall back. Fall back. I didn't know I could- I didn't know this was like fucking Clash Royale.

110
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:48,900
Advance. Flank and destroy. Where are you going? What? What? What? Go forward. Fall back. I gotta

111
00:19:48,900 --> 00:20:03,539
close the gate. Fall back. I gotta hit the fucking flood. Okay, here we go. Hit the- close the gate

112
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:37,460
so this is the- advance. Advance. Advance. Flank and destroy. Come on, give me more troops. What

113
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:53,609
the fuck did I just do? Get up there. Get up there. Get up there. Advance. Flank and destroy. Hit the

114
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:21,029
bell? I can't. I'm trying. Flank and destroy. Advance. Advance. Flank and destroy. Advance.

115
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:34,309
Advance. That plan sounds bad. Go in the fucking door. Go in. Why- what's with the traffic jam?

116
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:48,740
Go in. Advance. What was the plan? What am I- I already forgot what? Press forward.

117
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,859
What is- what is- what is advance and press forward? What's the difference?

118
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,769
Advance. Okay, we advance. Press forward. You go forward. That's advanced. That's advancing.

119
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:31,910
Okay, lie in the ruin before your might. Can somebody please give me an edit? Somebody please.

120
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,150
I know one of you will do it before the stream ends. Just- just please do this. You know exactly

121
00:22:36,150 --> 00:23:20,410
what I'm looking for. You know what I want you to do. Okay? Just hold on a second. Fucking been

122
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:49,930
waiting for this shit. Kind of skipped though, right? All right, that's all I want. You know

123
00:23:49,930 --> 00:24:01,700
what I want. You know what I want. That's all I care about. I don't care about anything else.

124
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,859
I just want- I need- I need you to do a ton of vapor coming out of my mouth. That's all I want.

125
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:16,579
I don't care. I don't- that's all I care about. Here we go.

126
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:24,970
It's coffee!

127
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,009
Holy shit, there's new mechanics here.

128
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:49,049
The bell crew cannot climb this hill! The bell crew!

129
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:58,490
Our troops must prepare the way by setting a ladder?

130
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:18,099
Okay. Knock the key- oh, knock the key free with the I. Three, two, one, oh fuck. Get up there.

131
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:33,400
Blank and destroy. Protect the bell. March right. Buy shit on fire. Fall back. Fall back.

132
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:47,900
Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Oh, people just got wiped out. March left. I gotta get in there.

133
00:25:48,779 --> 00:26:03,240
Fall back. Rally. Okay. This command orders your troops to gather in the area you have

134
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,069
highlighted with the cursor. Oh, that's- this is- this is what I'm looking for. Rally into the

135
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:26,309
microphone. Occupy enemy installations. Let's try it. Rally. All right, let me try this.

136
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:38,009
I gotta hit the key. I got another ball. Okay. How do I move the cursor? Rally. Oh, advance.

137
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:57,079
Hit that key. Fall back. There we go. Advance. There we go. Bounce it around in there.

138
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:15,529
Oops. Are my troops dead? Fall back. Fall back. Rally. Rally. Rally here to grab the- what the

139
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:23,750
fuck are you talking about? They're all on fire. I- I can't even go up there. Is it up there?

140
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:49,750
I can't even move the cursor up there. Rally. Get that key. Rally. Oh, fuck. I'm trying to just

141
00:27:49,750 --> 00:28:06,170
get in there. Come on. Rally. So much friendly fire. Well, like I'm thrown on a giant pinball.

142
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:29,049
Okay. Rally. Holy shit. Rally. Get the fucking thing- Rally. Do they all need to have their own

143
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:51,049
fucking thought bubbles? Is this roller coaster tycoon? What the fuck? Rally. Rally. Rally. Rally.

144
00:28:53,019 --> 00:29:09,559
Why are they not rallying? Well, we lost. Press X up- Rally. Okay. Fall back. They'll do that.

145
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:21,019
They won't fucking rally. We lost. Bad general tactics. Imagine if there's a guy just sitting

146
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:25,420
behind everybody with a fucking megaphone. Just screaming or- how could they even hear me?

147
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:34,650
No one can hear anything I'm saying. You have to go to the- I was trying to get them to go to the

148
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,410
ladder. They wouldn't go. I was going- Rally. Rally to the ladder. Rally. Fucking microphones.

149
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:49,930
Here we go. Place the ladder against the slope and leap. I gotta go that way. Knock the key

150
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:55,160
free with the odama to grab it. We're going right up the middle. I'm not deploying anything yet.

151
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:09,049
Destroy everything in the middle. Good. All right. Now we bring some group to burn it down. Good.

152
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:26,740
Fall back. There we go. You fucker. That was good. Advance. Fuck. I wasn't even looking at

153
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:34,779
the goddamn ball. Why are we so pushed back? Just get it flooded. Blank and destroy. Blank and destroy.

154
00:30:40,259 --> 00:31:02,980
Fall back. Put me out. Can I? Blank and destroy. Look at the ball. The ball's lit up. Come on. Get

155
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:19,509
up there. Oh god damn it. Crunch. Crackle. Crunch. Crackle. What am I hitting? Advance.

156
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:32,890
No. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. No. Bounce it around. Thank you. Finally. There we go. Rally here

157
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:38,859
to grab the fucking ladder. Well why won't you go? Oh my god. I just- I think I just killed everybody.

158
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:56,619
Fall back. Where's the ball? Yes. Bounce around. Everywhere. Blank and destroy. I just killed

159
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:06,779
everybody. Okay. Get that. Get that. Rally. What are you doing? What are you- I'm trying to kill

160
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:30,940
people. Rally. Rally. They have no morale. Rally. Go get the fucking ladder. They won't even go do

161
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:44,200
this. Use the C stick? It doesn't do anything. We're all dead again. March left. Move the cursor.

162
00:32:45,079 --> 00:33:03,029
I- It won't go any further to the corner. Look. It won't go any higher. D-pad? The D-pad isn't

163
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:19,799
going to do anything. Make them march to the left. Bilateral Lich 5000 bits. 50 dollars.

164
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,119
Jeremy, here's 50 dollars. Now march your men left and select the ladder. You have to have the bell

165
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,400
closer.

166
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:39,589
Thanks for the 50 dollar tip. Thanks for the actual tip. But how do- I can't advance up there

167
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:48,440
if they all fucking die. All right. Just get them all out there. Oh my god. Why is it so crunchy?

168
00:33:51,289 --> 00:34:00,150
March left. This is a really good start though. This is actually a fantastic start. I killed so

169
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:23,719
much shit here. March left. March left. I still can't go up that far. March left. I can't even go

170
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:34,730
up that far still. It's all the way up there. Look at my cursor. Fall back. I can't even go

171
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:47,079
that far. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. March left. March left. They have done- they

172
00:34:47,079 --> 00:35:01,829
want to listen to me anymore. Fall back. Fall back. Are they stuck? Fall back. Fall back.

173
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:23,590
Fall back. March left. Dude, it does nothing to do with the bell. Rally. I can't physically go

174
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:56,409
any higher the way the cursor is right now. Use the D-pad. Rally. Who's making fucking popcorn?

175
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,619
Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. You're gonna do too much. It's getting all over the stove.

176
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:16,250
All right. The ladder is in position. All right. Watch out for the ball. Advance.

177
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:28,340
Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Get in there. Get in there. Push it back.

178
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:36,219
Look at that guy right there. That guy's like, oh shit, I hope they don't fucking see me.

179
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:41,579
I hope nobody sees me if I just stand here. I gave it like one versus a thousand. Holy shit.

180
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:50,460
I have no fucking idea what's going on, but we did it. All right. So select. It's not like use

181
00:36:50,460 --> 00:37:09,940
the cursor. It's like pick the one out of two spots with the D-pad. I got 164 people. This game

182
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:21,429
is fucked up. This game is... I'll be completely honest with you guys. This game is stupid. This

183
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:36,300
game is really stupid, but I'm still interested. I still want to play it. Time for Pokemon TV. Not

184
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:43,619
yet. Not yet. Not yet. I'm still having fun. It's stupid, but it's fun. Mainly because I don't even

185
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:58,389
know half the things I'm doing. We're gonna get multiple balls here soon. All right. Now what?

186
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:59,909
All of our third battle in the distance.

187
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,989
Beyond those gates, we will face a general who will take all our might and cunning to defeat.

188
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,480
Oh, the rivers. This is going to be painful.

189
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,159
It's a pulley to the nearest bug that we can control the flow of that river.

190
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,639
This is a lot. This is too much to do.

191
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:53,989
Stick the mic up your nose. No. Give me the key. Give me this. Okay. I got a new command.

192
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:58,090
Close the gate.

193
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:12,579
What? You can seal the floodgate. Once your men have fixed the pulley to the gate,

194
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:15,219
order them to close the gate. The gate will fall into place.

195
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,190
Once the gate is closed, say flood the river to open it. Close the gate.

196
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:42,739
Fart into the mic. Oh, wow. That's fucking hilarious. Flood the river. No, it's not worth it.

197
00:39:42,739 --> 00:40:04,179
It's not worth it. March left. Fall back. I gotta do some work here. I need the spool. I need the

198
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:13,050
spool. Fall back. Fall back. March right. There we go. There we go. Knock that tower down.

199
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:25,050
Fall back. I got the key. Oops. Sorry. Grab that key. Rally. All right. I got the key.

200
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:39,190
Oh, shit. The troops have taken the key. Open that door. March right. Oh, fuck. They're coming

201
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:55,239
over here. Fall back. Get it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Put the key. March right.

202
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:20,420
March left. Flank and destroy. We need to push. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. Hit it.

203
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:32,119
Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. There it is. Finally. My god. Somebody get that. Somebody pick

204
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:58,619
that shit up. Rally. This is seriously the only fucking way to do this. Can I put it in my ear?

205
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:19,619
There we go. Good. Get the key, too. Don't rally there yet. Get that fucking key.

206
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:32,739
But what a good start. Rally. Fucking noise. So the crunching sounds in that. I don't know

207
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:51,750
what it is with this shit. Tape it? I could tape it like around my neck. I'm not at that point yet.

208
00:42:55,269 --> 00:45:10,659
Tape. Hold on. Gamer neck brace. Tape it to the controller. Oh, shit. I could have

209
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:18,630
taped it this way and just hold it right here. Supreme. He's the supreme commander.

210
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:39,980
Where's my? Oh, my headphones are already in. Okay. I'm ready. It's hard when I swallow my

211
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:58,389
neck pulses. Okay, let's go. Okay. Good. Good. Good start. I know. I know what the key is. I know

212
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:28,599
what the key is. Rally. Good. Give me that spool. Flank and destroy. Shit. Rally. No, no, no, no.

213
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:43,289
I forgot. We've used the key to open the gate. Rally. Oh, that was a good hit.

214
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:57,110
Don't. Watch out. Okay. The troops have taken the pulley. What's the command? What's the command?

215
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:08,500
Advance. What's the command? Move right. I don't know. It's not. It's like it's like close the

216
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:58,889
pulley or something. Close the gate. You look dumb. What's this? Wait, wait, wait.

217
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:07,699
Game. What are people linking here? Controllers. Game queue.

218
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:58,019
This is why you always check what's in what the contents of the bag are.

219
00:48:58,949 --> 00:50:39,210
Always check the contents of the bag. Okay. That's very difficult, too. Oh, my God. All right.

220
00:50:39,210 --> 00:51:00,179
Let's go. Get that fucking key. Rally. Rally. The audio. I know the audio is so bad.

221
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:15,719
Fall back. Fall back. I want. I need to get the spool. I need to get the spool of yarn.

222
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:32,019
Yes. Come on. Open the gate. Okay. Advance. Protect the belt. Get the. Come on.

223
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:41,900
Take the audio out of the corn flakes, please. Take the audio out of the corn flakes, please.

224
00:51:44,940 --> 00:52:09,190
God damn it. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I saved it. Advance. Blank and destroy. God damn it.

225
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:21,289
There's people here. Fall back. Fall back. I'm disabled. I'm disabled. I'm disabled. I'm disabled.

226
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:43,190
I'm trying to hit the stupid fucking spool over here and I can't get it.

227
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:55,860
What just happened? Why did it fire? It prematurely fired. No, I don't. Don't grab the key.

228
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:05,829
Wine plus corn flakes zone. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Now I have to bring people. Fall back.

229
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:18,340
Rally. Fall back. Fall back. I got to select. I got to select. I got to select. I know. I know

230
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:32,019
what it does. I know what it does. You don't have to tell me. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Get it.

231
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:53,019
Fall back. Oh, shit. They're over there. They're past the river now. God damn it. Fall back. Fall

232
00:53:53,019 --> 00:54:05,559
back. Fall back. What? All right. Roll back and kill everybody. Here it comes. All right. Okay.

233
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:29,900
All right. Now get it. Okay. Rally. Fall back. Ball and bag torture. God damn it. All right. Yes.

234
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:45,639
Advance. There we go. Nice. The floodgates now open and I can't. It's got to hit these guys. Come on.

235
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:00,710
Fall back. Don't push forward. I don't have enough men. I got to wipe them out with this.

236
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:15,690
There it is. I'm killing my own fucking people. No, don't turn this shit on. Close the gate. Push

237
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:25,739
forward. Did that just say he hates us? Did that guy just say he hates streaming? Push forward.

238
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:42,409
Close the gate. Close the gate. Push forward. Push forward. Press forward. Press forward.

239
00:55:46,360 --> 00:56:08,900
Press forward. There's a lot of fucking people there. Press forward. Come on. Press forward.

240
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:23,449
What? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Press forward. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come

241
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:37,989
on. Come on. Come on. Thank God. Press forward. Good hit. Press forward. Blank and destroy. Blank

242
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:48,699
and destroy. They have no morale. How do I make them get morale? Holy shit. I just hit everybody.

243
00:56:48,699 --> 00:57:13,699
Press forward. Press what? Press what? I think this is over. Press forward. They got no morale.

244
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:28,500
Get that green ball. Press forward. This is it. Press forward. Come on. I got a green fucking ball.

245
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:44,760
Is this? What? Press forward. What the fuck is going on with the ball? Press forward.

246
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:58,380
Press forward. Shit. Dude, fuck. This is playing pinball with a bunch of people.

247
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:06,250
That was really good. Press forward. They've no morale. They're not gonna listen to me.

248
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:21,210
You're losing frames. No, I'm not falling for that again. Press forward. Are they going? I gotta,

249
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:38,059
like, close this other gate. Trying this one more fucking time. One more time. One more time.

250
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:55,739
Don't put out all your troops yet. Knock this down first. Boom. Okay. Just so it's available.

251
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:07,619
Good. Get the key too. That's both now. Hold on. Don't. Get the key. Get the key first.

252
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:23,989
Rally. What? What am I opening this door even for? What's the point of opening this door?

253
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:27,989
No, no, no. Close the gate. Close it. Oh my God. Why did that have to happen?

254
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:47,159
I've tried to aim at that fucking thing a hundred times. Rally. Give them encouragement. There is

255
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:58,059
no encouragement. The door, the key opens up. Hold on. Push forward. Press forward. We use the

256
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:12,539
key to open the gate. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Did I just kill, like, how many people

257
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:26,389
did I just kill? Close the gate. Good. The curse is in the wrong place. Close the gate. Good hit.

258
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:40,019
Close the gate. Why did they, where'd they come from? They're all, wait, who did that?

259
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:45,639
Close the gate. Close the, close the gate. Close the gate. Close the gate. It closed.

260
01:00:46,739 --> 01:01:01,739
It hit the gate. The gate closed. It was the other gate that was closed.

261
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:21,739
That only works on the second gate. Oh, so fuck. Fuck. Okay. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I want

262
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:27,400
to at least see the boss. I mean, I want to see the first boss. Okay. Here we go. That one's closed.

263
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:38,920
Don't hit that gate anymore. I can't even control. Rally. I can't even control where the thing goes.

264
01:01:38,920 --> 01:02:01,210
I'm just going to knock that over and press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward.

265
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:08,650
Press forward. Press forward. Just swim. Swim, damn you. Press forward. It happened again.

266
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:29,880
I'm not sending any troops out until it's clear that I've got that settled.

267
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:46,860
What is this? Bad? Bad what? Bad. This, this, this image just confuses me. I don't, I, I, this image

268
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:57,909
confuses me. I don't even know. Thinking quickly, Jerma constructs a GameCube mode.

269
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:02,809
That's like too many replacements here. All right. Don't send any troops out until I got this fucking

270
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:25,670

01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:53,670
Last opportunity. This is the last one. And then we're watching Pokemon TV. No. I have to do this.

Oh shit. It's okay. No, no, no. It's fine. Fine. Just rush it. Just rush it. Just rush B.

No.

302
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:35,770
More of those like tongue out reactions. What do you mean rice balls? What does that mean?

310
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:29,989
No, it's not. This is not a gambler's fallacy. I paid like $12 for this game. I don't have to

311
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:37,859
gamble anymore money. Why are you moving forward? What the fuck are you doing? Just, oh my god.

That guy's huge. The final battle of the Kuruwau Plains. That menacing figure is General Kawai

350
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:32,090
Apechia. I could have hit him with the ball, don't I?

351

Wait, it's flipper versus flipper?

So he's playing pinball too. Rally troops had a flipper to seize it.

01:37:24,409 --> 01:37:48,069

single time, every video game you've ever played, every establishment you've ever been to,

387

Do it! What the fuck just happened? It bounced over the... All right, you hit it too hard. That's

396
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:45,829
like when you're playing air hockey with all your friends and they hit it too hard and it's like,

397
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:57,289
dude, it's like... It like bounces and goes that way. Like fucking relax. That was so good too.

Never pressed forward. Doesn't matter. The ball came back to hit me in the fucking... What's going on?

399
01:42:07,859 --> 01:42:13,109

Press forward. Oh, what? It's not fucking fair. Press forward. I gotta go around. Blank and destroy.

You know what I mean? Again? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta beat this guy. You know what? We're going

405
01:43:52,170 --> 01:44:04,060

Everybody get in there. Press forward. Good roll. Good fucking roll. Press forward. Look at that

01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:47,300

01:47:50,939 --> 01:48:03,579
Holy shit. Come on. Come on. Kill these motherfuckers. Kill these motherfuckers. Advance.

417
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:12,840
Fuck you, man. God. What? This was magnetized to my character? That's just don't worry. It's

418
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,689
just the Wii sensor bar. It was just the Wii sensor bar. Wasn't anything expensive.

419
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:33,300
You can have two goddamn candles and it'll work. I want to watch this video. I want to watch this

420
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:48,520
video. Where is it? Somebody actually made it. Good. I can't wait to watch this. Hold on. Let me

01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:26,699
Hold on. I mean, wrong one. Wrong one. I got the right one. Please. Okay, this is what I wanted.

423
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:36,600
Wrong one. I don't understand. It's this one. Why is it? What are you talking about?

424
01:49:37,479 --> 01:50:19,020
Germavape. How many of these were made? Here we go. I've been waiting for this shit. Why did you add

425
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:32,119
that? Wait, but hold on a second. Why did you? It was just supposed to be the e-cigar. Why did

426
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:49,430
you make it an actual vape pen? It comes up for so long. And then, look, it trails off and it happens

427
01:50:49,430 --> 01:51:07,590
again. It's perfect. And all y'all were saying, why is he doing this? Come on, man. Minus two.

428
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:23,500
Come on, man. That's what I wanted. That's what I want. I'm getting really fucking sweaty.

429
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:35,500
That's fucking hilarious. I love it. All right, let's go. Wait, to the other one. Oh, there is

430
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:51,689
another one. This one's much longer than that one. Can somebody please give me an edit? Somebody,

431
01:51:51,689 --> 01:51:56,170
please. I know one of you will do it before the stream ends. Just please do this. You know exactly

432
01:51:56,170 --> 01:52:04,170
what I'm looking for. You know what I want you to do. Okay? Just hold on a second. Wait, did you

433
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:48,390
not edit it? I've been waiting for this shit. Imagine doing that. You just blow a train whistle.

434
01:52:48,390 --> 01:53:00,979
That's just what you do every like seven minutes. Another one. I'm not clicking that. All right,

435
01:53:00,979 --> 01:53:05,699
that's it. There's a better one. Stop blinking the fucking uh-oh stinky video, okay? I'm not

436
01:53:05,699 --> 01:53:17,539
gonna watch it. All right, that was fun. Let's go back to what we were doing. Me desperately trying

437
01:53:17,539 --> 01:53:29,779
to beat this microphone video game from 20 years ago. 50,000 channel points for a train whistle.

438
01:53:29,779 --> 01:53:41,909
That's not happening. Back to losing at pinball on purpose. It's fucking exhausting.

439
01:53:49,180 --> 01:54:10,060
Press forward. Oh god. All right, give me something. Press forward. Damn, this morale is so bad. I'm

440
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:19,270
not gonna bring any troops out until it's confirmed that everything's safe. It's that hard.

441
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:59,079
Come on. There it is. There it is. There it is. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward.

442
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:41,500
Press forward. Where's the fucking ball? Rally. Rally. Rally. Fall back. Fall back. They're not

443
01:55:41,500 --> 01:56:24,939

444
01:56:24,939 --> 01:57:13,430

446
01:57:38,729 --> 01:57:55,180
I don't know. Press forward. I gotta get this shit up there. You gotta get it up there and bounce

447
01:57:55,180 --> 01:58:08,869
around before he fucking kills all you guys. He looks like he's playing a racing game. Retreat.

448
01:58:08,869 --> 01:58:15,109
You gotta get it up there and fucking smash the fuck out of him before you even send anybody.

449
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:28,739
He looks like he's riding a horse. The audio is desynced. It shouldn't be. Hold on. We're gonna

450
01:58:28,739 --> 01:59:03,779
test this sometime. One. Two. Three. Hold on. It's a little off. I'm like a couple of- I'm like 100

451
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:57,050
milliseconds early. Let's try this. Let's try like changes anything. Okay. Hold on. One. Two. It's

452
01:59:57,050 --> 02:00:35,529
way worse. I'm not fucking muted. I think we're good. Is that good? Get that green. And here we

02:00:35,529 --> 02:01:04,170

02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:24,890
Oh, you fucking idiot. Remember your GameCube mic is muted. Oh, shit.

All right. Rally. Where are you guys going? Rally. How are they getting in? Oh, you fucking missed

Press forward. Attack and flank. Whatever that means. I can't even get the fucking ball up there

It hit a fucking tree. Press forward. Oh, that just fucked it all up. Press forward. Press forward.

02:04:58,579 --> 02:05:30,470
Rally. I think I hit that fucking tree. Actually mad at pinball. Oh, wouldn't you be?

Shit. Ball. Ball's fucking reversing. Press forward. Press forward. Get up there.

470
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:26,710

Fall back. Rally. All right. Kill this motherfucker. Fucking kill him. Go. Press forward.

481
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:38,500

482
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:47,449
and it's a pinball game and he can shoot it back at me. It's like, hey, I know you're driving

483
02:11:47,449 --> 02:11:52,970
right now, but there's fucking land mines everywhere. Just don't swerve around those

484
02:11:52,970 --> 02:12:15,770
because I'm going to run over a landmine. I don't know. What am I going to do? Where's the ball?

495
02:16:36,790 --> 02:17:07,579

496
02:17:07,579 --> 02:17:14,780

Rally. Give me that fucking green ball. You can't be serious. Here we go, motherfucker. Now we're in

Oh my god. Imagine having a time limit in this dumb fucking game.

505
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:51,079
You gotta be kidding me. I am shocked and I am appalled right now. No way. No way.

506
02:21:10,569 --> 02:21:18,340
These fucking shells shot. Why is there a time limit? Why would there be a time limit?

You're killing me. Why would a tree respawn right now? You've got to be shitting me. Rally.

Press forward. Press forward. Flank and destroy. Press forward. Rally. Press. I can't even keep up

537
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:49,350

02:35:49,350 --> 02:36:02,860
holy man. I have to kill this motherfucker? Press forward. And I have 87 seconds. Oh,

541
02:36:38,620 --> 02:37:00,409
All right. Kill him. Kill him. It's time for him to die. Rally. Rally. Where are they coming from?

542
02:37:00,409 --> 02:37:24,489
Is it time? Press forward. You've got to get the fuck up there, man. Knock him down. Rally.

543
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:41,110
Kill him. Kill this motherfucker right now. What the fuck am I hitting? This is fucking chaos.

544
02:37:47,590 --> 02:38:06,299
Rally. Fucking kill. Rally. Why can't they? Rally. Rally.

545
02:38:32,809 --> 02:39:40,600
Wicked witch of the west. What the fuck? Push forward. Rally. Rally. Push forward.

02:39:41,819 --> 02:41:01,700
Press forward. Fucking unbelievable. Fucking god damn believable. Press forward. Rally. Rally.

02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:23,690
Rally. Rally. Get me in both. Now. Now. What's taking you so fucking long? There's like a

548
02:41:23,690 --> 02:41:45,059
hundred of you up there. What is taking you so long? Rally. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back.

549
02:41:45,059 --> 02:42:01,739
Push forward. Oh my god. Why does that have to be so fucking annoying? Just get in there so I can...

550
02:42:03,100 --> 02:43:02,180
How much time do I have? What a fucking joke. Press forward. Press forward. Rally. What the

551
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:48,549
fuck is happening? Press forward. Why in the name of god do they respawn? Why in the name of god's

552
02:43:48,549 --> 02:44:25,340
green earth do they respawn? Press forward. Press forward. Now I'm overwhelmed because he has five

553
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:40,729
million more troops than me because they just keep pouring the fuck out. Rally. Push forward.

554
02:44:40,729 --> 02:45:15,370
I have only 146 seconds, man. I just... All right. We just played. I caught it. Rally. Oh my god.

555
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:30,059
Please. This is fucking ridiculous. This is fucking ridiculous, man. This is three. I got two more

556
02:45:30,059 --> 02:46:09,079
tries before I eat this disc on camera. Rally. Rally. I don't have enough time. This is the third

557
02:46:09,079 --> 02:46:24,620
level of the game. Yeah. What the hell were you thinking? Did you develop the game with your eyes

558
02:46:24,620 --> 02:47:28,500
closed? Oh, now he's actually getting mad. Now he's actually getting like angry. Rally. Rally. Rally.

559
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:44,260
Get that green. Fuck. What? What the fuck, man? What are you talking about? How long does it take

560
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:55,879
you motherfuckers to capture? You captured the left one in five seconds. Fall back. I got no men.

561
02:47:56,440 --> 02:48:11,500
Stay up there. Stay up there. Stay up there. Come on. I need like 100 people.

562
02:48:13,979 --> 02:48:33,129
Press forward. That's not 100 people. You need to write a blues song about this. Press forward.

563
02:48:38,549 --> 02:48:59,670
Press forward. Press forward. What the fuck just happened? Press forward. Can I get a green?

564
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:05,989
Why does it feel like he has more people now than before that just happened? Look at his front lines.

565
02:49:06,629 --> 02:49:24,569
Press fuck. What the fuck? He's got more fucking humans. Press forward. Press forward. I have no

566
02:49:24,569 --> 02:50:22,620
men. This thing is going to push me back. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. What was

567
02:50:22,620 --> 02:51:20,440
that? What the fuck? All right. Let's go everybody up. Push forward. Push forward. Press forward.

568
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:38,489
Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Hey, press forward. Press forward. Hey,

569
02:51:38,489 --> 02:52:40,899
press forward. Oh. Press forward. Why did the green just disappear? Rally. Rally. Rally. Press

570
02:52:40,899 --> 02:53:26,250
forward. Press forward. Press forward. Fall back. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. This

571
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:31,909
is it, Ryder. In the meantime, I'm going to snack, snack, snack, snack, snack, snack, snack, snack,

572
02:53:31,909 --> 02:54:12,940
rally. Fall back. Fall back. I can't even get a fucking goddamn fruit snack. Press forward.

573
02:54:21,079 --> 02:54:26,389
Get it. Get that green thing. Get the green thing. And now there's a wall here that's

574
02:54:26,389 --> 02:54:31,370
screwing up my whole game. There's a wall here now that's messed up the whole thing now, son,

575
02:54:31,370 --> 02:55:02,020
didn't it? You messed up the whole thing, son. This is insanity. Imagine getting this for

576
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:07,540
Christmas and crying because you can't beat this. Imagine how bad your mother or father would

577
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:15,829
felt watching your fucking son or daughter sit here and cry playing this level to be like,

578
02:55:16,549 --> 02:55:43,129
shit, should have got some Super Mario Sunshine. Oh, should I help them? Press forward. Rally.

579
02:55:52,840 --> 02:56:30,870
Get up there. Dude. Rally. Rally. It's over. It's already over. Put me on. Put me on. Oh, well,

580
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:36,149
retreat. That's what you got to do. You got to say it's fucking over. You got to talk about how

581
02:56:36,149 --> 02:56:40,069
it's over and it's not over. That's what you got to do. That's what you got to do. And then

582
02:56:40,069 --> 02:57:15,219
the game has to like have a great... Don't even talk shit. Just play. Fall back. Push forward.

583
02:57:15,219 --> 02:57:25,670
Rally. Troops die soon as they come out. Yeah. And unfortunately for me, I don't get to have an

584
02:57:25,670 --> 02:57:33,190
infinite supply like this motherfucker does. See, this dickhead can just spawn as many people as

585
02:57:33,190 --> 02:57:37,670
he wants for the entire duration of this whole fight. I get like a hundred people and then maybe

586
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:45,750
a green fruit snack ball that I can steal some of his guys. This is infinite fucking dog shit.

587
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:30,229
No, it's not. One more after this. Press forward. Press forward. Rally. Why did I lose the green

588
02:58:30,229 --> 02:59:05,959
immediately? Rally. Rally. Rally. Fall back. Rally. Why does it take them so long? It takes them one

589
02:59:05,959 --> 02:59:09,479
second to capture the left one. Why does it take so long to capture the right one?

590
02:59:10,809 --> 03:00:11,989
Oh. Rally. Oh, you did it. You finally did it. Fall back. Rally. Press forward. How did you sneak

591
03:00:11,989 --> 03:00:55,670
by there, motherfucker? What just happened? We don't have any more fucking morale. TikTok.

592
03:00:56,629 --> 03:01:05,190
TikTok. There's no more men. There's no more men on my team. Give me the green ball. Give me the

593
03:01:05,190 --> 03:01:31,030
green ball and all things are fine. Push forward. Push forward. Push forward. This is actually the

594
03:01:31,030 --> 03:01:38,229
last time I'm going to do this before I'm going to put this fucking disk in like and put like a

595
03:01:38,229 --> 03:01:46,100
random address and fucking like and like Antarctica and ship it there. I'm going to like middle of the

596
03:01:46,100 --> 03:02:23,940
fucking ocean in Antarctica or something. Get this away from my house. That was fucking such bullshit.

597
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:37,370
That wasn't even fair. That was not even. That was not even. Shit. That's so unfair.

598
03:02:37,930 --> 03:02:43,750
That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't. That can't count.

599
03:02:44,790 --> 03:03:53,370
Push forward. Press forward. Dude, the ball. What the fuck are you doing, mate? Rally. Rally.

600
03:03:53,370 --> 03:04:14,440
Everybody's dead. I gotta get it up there. In there. He's addicted. I'm addicted. I'm addicted

601
03:04:14,440 --> 03:04:43,979
to not. I'm addicted to beating this one boss. Fucking audio is killing my brain. Rally. All

602
03:04:43,979 --> 03:04:48,760
right. I need green now. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green.

603
03:04:48,760 --> 03:05:03,530
Give me the green thing. It's not green. Fall back. Fall back. That's what I want. Did his wall just

604
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:39,750
respawn? Why did this motherfucker's wall just respawn? Fall back. Rally. Press forward. Press

605
03:05:39,750 --> 03:06:01,020
forward. Get that fucking green. This is it. Why did it take it off, bro? Press forward. Press

606
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:53,940
forward. Press forward. I was trying to roll it over to the fucking stupid time. Rally. Press forward.

607
03:06:53,940 --> 03:07:33,209
Rally. Rally. Three hours of crackling audio. Rally. Rally. I know. There's like explosions

608
03:07:33,209 --> 03:07:45,799
in my fucking ear. I know. There's nothing left. It's just a bell guy. I took the disc out and I

609
03:07:45,799 --> 03:08:10,790
can't even stop. I took the fucking CD out and I can't even stop playing. This game looks a little

610
03:08:10,790 --> 03:08:20,840
frustrating with a happy face. What if you beat it with the disc? This cover is open. If you want

611
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:40,100
to continue, close the disc cover. No, I don't think I do. Remind me to never play that game

612
03:08:40,100 --> 03:08:51,639
ever again. Remind me to fucking shred the disc before this stream turns off. It's fun. It's fun.
