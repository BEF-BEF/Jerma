1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,059
What is happening, guys? It is Jerma bringing you a gameplay commentary of the Scout on Coldfront.

2
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:15,060
And when I say gameplay commentary, I don't really mean commentary because I kind of want to talk about some things that I'm doing for tomorrow.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:25,489
And hopefully it's good for you guys, hopefully it's informative for you guys because I've never seen somebody do it before and I think it's something that would be helpful to a lot of people.

4
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:37,490
I have a lot of refined metal, as you guys are aware. I've shown it to you before. I used to have a lot more, but I'm going to be able to craft every single item tomorrow, potentially, for the Uber Update.

5
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:50,899
If you play Team Fortress 2 and you don't know what the Uber Update is, hello, I just found you under a rock and the sun is up there and the ground is right below you, so welcome to Earth.

6
00:00:50,899 --> 00:01:05,900
But seriously, the Uber Update is launching tomorrow. I'm recording this as of right now. It's Wednesday night, so if this video isn't uploaded or if you don't see this until tomorrow, which would be Thursday, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do about that.

7
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:18,260
What I'm doing is I'm going to craft every single item and I'm going to put every single item, a demonstration of every single item, into one video.

8
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:28,700
Now, when I said I haven't seen anybody do that before, what I meant by that is usually when you want to see a demonstration of a new item, like, oh, what the hell is a brass beast?

9
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:39,700
And you look up, oh, like, Team Fortress 2, new update, new item, brass beast, or you look up for a new item or new items in update, you know, the war update or something.

10
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Usually you'll get a convoluted mess of videos where there's a gameplay here, there's, like, a demonstration here, but you never get to see everything in one video and, you know, skip to a point that you want to see, oh, I just want to see the heavy items.

11
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Oh, they're right here, all of them, and I can see them all right here. That's what I'm doing tomorrow. I'm going to craft every item and then once, oh, that was a nice quick scope.

12
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I was watching the television here.

13
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:20,060
I'm going to craft every item and you'll see every, I'm going to do a gameplay where I spend maybe 30 seconds, 20 to 30 seconds on each item in a real game situation.

14
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I'm not just going to go on a server and put a bot up and go, this is how you shoot him in the face with nothing happening.

15
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:41,060
I want to see, personally, I want to see real gameplay with this stuff like I'm sure a lot of you guys want to see because those of you that obviously are not as well off in Team Fortress, like, you don't have a lot of, like, refined metal or a lot of hats to build a trade.

16
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:55,060
It's hard to tell what items you actually want and what items you don't want because there's so many of them you go, oh, well, do I really want the new heavy minigun? I mean, I don't know, how is it?

17
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,060
I'm going to be able to tell you how it is and you'll be able to see me play with it.

18
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,370
So I hope the video is no longer than 10 minutes or 12, 15 minutes because that's the time limit.

19
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:12,370
But I'm going to try and crunch everything down into like a 10 minute, like I said, 20, 30 seconds for each class or each weapon.

20
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,370
And hopefully it's informative for you guys.

21
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:23,669
And that's what I plan on doing tomorrow all day because I'm a real dork, a real dork, not one of these fake dorks.

22
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,669
But anyway, let's get to the commentary of the video.

23
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,669
I'm playing as a scout.

24
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,669
This is Coldfront.

25
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,669
It's a five control point map.

26
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,669
Five control point maps are a little impossible to play with a pub group.

27
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:48,669
And I love Five Gorge, but like every single five control point map on a public server, it's just a complete mess and nobody works together.

28
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,669
And it just, it's a complete stalemate.

29
00:03:50,669 --> 00:04:01,669
At least what I've seen 90 percent of the time when I play in a public server that does five control point maps, you're in there for 45 minutes playing in the same game.

30
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,669
And it's just like, all right, can we get this?

31
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,669
Can we end this now?

32
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:12,669
But see, like right here, we got the point, but now it's like coming back and then we go forward and it comes back and it goes forward and comes back.

33
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:20,670
And a lot of times admins just hit like the, you know, the frigging blow up button and just go stalemate and start it over.

34
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,670
Which I don't blame them for doing that, you know.

35
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,670
If it's in the rotation, you got to use it, you know, whatever.

36
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:39,670
So for the remainder of this gameplay commentary, well, not for the remainder of it, but for a lot of it, you're going to see me trying to avoid a sentry gun that's in their last, second to last control point room.

37
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,670
And it gets to a point where I just get so fed up that I switch to heavy in another minute or so here.

38
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,670
And because nobody would take it out.

39
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,670
You'll see where it is.

40
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,670
It's coming up here in a second.

41
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,670
You'll see where the sentry gun is.

42
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:01,670
And it baffles me to think that somebody can't just turn this corner and shoot like three or four stickies in here.

43
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,670
See, look, it's right here.

44
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,670
Look at this.

45
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,670
OK.

46
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,670
I can't do it because obviously it was a level three.

47
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:13,670
So I take a trip over here and I just think, OK, can like a heavy just turn that corner and take it out?

48
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,670
Or can a demo man, you know, throw a couple pipes or something?

49
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,670
And then I realized something very, very important.

50
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,670
We are in the middle of a free week in Team Fortress 2.

51
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,670
So it makes complete sense as to, number one, why an engineer would build a sentry gun right there.

52
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,670
And number two, why nobody would be able to kill it.

53
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,040
Because everybody is like brand new.

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,040
So for the remainder of this Scout part of the gameplay, I just try to avoid the sentry gun.

55
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,220
And I figured maybe at some point I would I would be able to see a teammate get in there and take it out.

56
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
I could just rush for the last point.

57
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
But it just doesn't happen.

58
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,220
And I stick with Scout to try.

59
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:05,220
At this point, I'm really just trying to, you know, get behind people and pick off like, you know, some medics or some snipers or something like that.

60
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Because I can't go through the front door because the sentry is there.

61
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
So I kind of have to go all over the place here.

62
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
I get three or four kills in a row here.

63
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,220
I get this Scout, me and him go kind of one on one and put him six feet under.

64
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Come around here. This Heavy is using the bear claws.

65
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,220
He stops to eat a sandwich. I take him out, spin around.

66
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,220
There's a Spy. I can tell because he's running my direction with a sniper rifle out.

67
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,220
He dies. And that was a good little streak there.

68
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
I come around this corner again.

69
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,220
And like I said, I have to go like this kind of strange route.

70
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,220
And Soldier comes in here. I kill him with a crit.

71
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
Lucky crit, I know.

72
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,220
But the sentry is still here.

73
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,220
And I'm like, come on, there's got to be somebody who has to be able to take that out.

74
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,220
I come over here. I kill this Spy.

75
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,220
I'm at the spawn room.

76
00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:00,220
And I'm just wishing right now that somebody would just cap that point so I could just steal this win and finally be done with this cold front gameplay.

77
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,220
But see right here, I'm just kind of like, okay, so what do I do now?

78
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Do I, I'm just going to run back to the spawn.

79
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Hopefully I can get behind somebody and pick somebody off.

80
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,220
But that's what I try and do.

81
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,220
And as you can see, there's nobody here.

82
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
So I see this Scout.

83
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,220
I start to lose. He gets a nice shot on me.

84
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,220
And that life is over.

85
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
And guess what I died from?

86
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Yeah, the sentry gun that's sitting in the middle of the point.

87
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:34,220
So I think it's pretty clear now that I'm not going to be able to play Scout for that much longer.

88
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,220
I'm stuck kind of in a, I'm doing really good as the Scout.

89
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,220
I have this kind of mentality where I'm saying, no, but I'm doing so well as the Scout.

90
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,220
I can't stop now.

91
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Like, come on.

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I don't want to go play like Heavy or Demoman.

93
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,220
I'm doing the Scout gameplay.

94
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
I'm doing pretty good.

95
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
I never do good with the Scout.

96
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
That's what was going through my head at this point.

97
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
So I didn't really want to change.

98
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,220
But you have to do sacrifices to better the team.

99
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,220
And eventually that's what I say.

100
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,220
I wasn't that nice about it though.

101
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Because in my head it was, god damn it, these motherfuckers.

102
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I swear to god that was going through my head.

103
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,220
I'm a real idiot right here.

104
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I come over here shooting this sentry over and over again rather than shooting the Engineer.

105
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,220
But it was enough of a distraction, I guess, to have my teammates shoot a few missiles over there and take it out.

106
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,220
So at least that was going good for our team.

107
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,220
And I really thought right here, because I think that was the sentry that was sitting on the point.

108
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,220
I really thought that we were going to just push forward.

109
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,220
And the sentry's gone.

110
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Let's take it.

111
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,220
Let's take the point now.

112
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,220
But the curse of the five control point public server is still here.

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,220
And we actually don't push any further.

114
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
I kill this Soldier.

115
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
I turn around.

116
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,220
I smoke this Spy, which was probably a dead Ringer, so whatevs.

117
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:07,220
But what I'm not realizing at this point, I kill a couple more people and I distract myself a little bit here.

118
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
I kill one or two more people.

119
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,220
I get a fish kill right here on this guy, which is great.

120
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,220
But they're building a sentry up right now, again.

121
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,220
And this is me just being an idiot and not realizing the fact that they're building a sentry.

122
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,220
The whole reason why we haven't been able to go in there is because they had a sentry in there.

123
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
And I didn't do anything about it.

124
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
And right here, I run past it and look at this.

125
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Boom, boom.

126
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
There's a sentry there now.

127
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,220
So at this point, it's getting really, really difficult for me to want to play Scout anymore,

128
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,220
even though I'm doing very, very well as a Scout right now.

129
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,460
I know, as well as you know at this point, that I need to change classes.

130
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I need to change this up a little bit.

131
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,820
But I stay with the Scout still.

132
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
I think this is the last thing I do with the Scout.

133
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
I try. I think I said I'm going to do one more.

134
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
And if we don't get it when I do one more, then I will change.

135
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
And this is a rage moment right here.

136
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
This is actually what makes me change classes for real.

137
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I come around this corner and I'm like, alright, who am I going to pick off here?

138
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Oh, you.

139
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
You'll bang. Got you.

140
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh, Demoman.

141
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Hey, what's going on, my friend?

142
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
How are you?

143
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Let me just get one shot in the air by the lock and load, I believe it was.

144
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
Yes, it was.

145
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
And look at his health.

146
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Look at his health.

147
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
So right now, I go Super Saiyan 4 and I go heavy.

148
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,820
And this is where things start to turn for the much better at this point.

149
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I'm using the gloves of running urgently, the default minigun and the sandwich.

150
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
And you'll see what happens.

151
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Well, look what happens right when I go heavy.

152
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
We start rolling past everything.

153
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,820
And the sentry in this room is gone for some reason.

154
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Apparently, when I decide to switch classes, it just disappears into thin air.

155
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,820
So I kill the scout. I come into here. I eat a sandwich real quick.

156
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Take out this Demoman.

157
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,820
And look at this. There's no sentry here now, which is what I was prepared for.

158
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Two spies try to get me. That's one.

159
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,059
Here comes another one. See, I'm freaking out and running around in a circle right here.

160
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,059
I think that's the same one.

161
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,059
Another one comes over. Here he is. Boom. Get him.

162
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,059
Take out the scout.

163
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,059
But obviously, that's pure rage energy was coming out.

164
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,059
That was not bullets that was coming out of that gun.

165
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,059
That was pure rage. And I almost did it.

166
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,059
And right here, I think I say, like, we almost got it.

167
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,059
Please, please push.

168
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,059
And eventually, we get it.

169
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,059
We get this second to last point.

170
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,059
And you'll see how horrible this is.

171
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,059
My brain was literally about to explode when this happened.

172
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,059
See, we got this medic here. It's like, alright, let's go, buddy.

173
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,059
Boom. You're dead.

174
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,059
Let's keep going. Oh, I got two medics here? Are you telling me?

175
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,059
Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's do it.

176
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,059
So we get up here.

177
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,059
We push through.

178
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,059
And we actually get this point.

179
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:02,059
They try to build a sentry gun. It goes down.

180
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,059
The engineer, I think, goes down too by this Pyro.

181
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,059
So there's two medics behind me right now.

182
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,059
Charge an Uber. Get rid of the engineer.

183
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,059
And look at what happens right here. Look at this.

184
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,059
Look at the control points.

185
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,059
This is like neck and neck. And bang, we get it.

186
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,059
And it's like, alright.

187
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,059
Like, finally, finally, we can end this. Let's go.

188
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,059
So a Pyro comes up behind us, tries to ruin our day.

189
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,059
Doesn't work. I am in no mood right now.

190
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,059
This guy's almost got an Uber. Let's go.

191
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,059
The game is over, baby. We got this.

192
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,059
Where's my medic?

193
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,059
What happened to my medic?

194
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,059
What happened to my medic?

195
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,059
So this is a cut right here. This is a cut.

196
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,059
I change to spy. This is about 15 minutes later.

197
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,059
My head exploded and I said, you know what, I'm just going to go spy.

198
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:57,059
Whatever is back here on this last point, I am going to kill it.

199
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,059
And then I'm going to pee on it.

200
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:03,059
So I was so bad at this point because after that happened,

201
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,059
after we got killed, after I got killed at that last point,

202
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,059
it came back to the middle again.

203
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:15,059
And if that medic had just hit the button at the right time,

204
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,059
it would have been fine. But you know what?

205
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,059
Does it matter? Because guess what?

206
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,059
We went right here. I don't care about my own life.

207
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,059
Get rid of the damn sentry. Let's get on the point and let's win it.

208
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,059
And we end up winning it right here.

209
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,059
Yeah, we win it.

210
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,059
But anyways, stay tuned for tomorrow

211
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,059
because tomorrow is going to be a big day, guys.

212
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,059
If you're watching this tomorrow, then hello, welcome to today.

213
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,059
And I hope you enjoy my new video that's coming out.

214
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,059
Take care, guys.
