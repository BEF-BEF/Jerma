1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:12,099
Hi, I know, I'm sorry, I know it's like 351 pacific time. I fucking fell asleep, I took a nap,

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:19,289
I got up, I went back to bed, and you know when you just sometimes you just take a nap

3
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,410
and then not everything turns off. Your brain, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, it all just

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:35,030
shuts off. I rolled around and it's like oh it's like it's like three ten. It's like oh

5
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:47,420
what oh okay. Gotta get the fuck out of this bed. Can't stay awake for more than an hour?

6
00:00:49,979 --> 00:01:00,539
God. 4 p.m time to go to bed. But anyways, there are some very very fun things.

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,879
Reason why my sleep schedule is so screwed up is because I was in the discord a couple days

8
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:15,159
ago or yesterday morning because I had stayed up and I was getting all kinds of cool shit ready.

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,040
Got like the sometimes I just get the itch like once every couple weeks or so to just

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,760
I want to have like a notepad and I want to find out like some fun things to do on stream

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,379
and that's what I did. I was in the discord at like six or seven o'clock in the morning

12
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:37,019
pacific talking just like oh hey so here's like some fun things. People are just like

13
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:47,209
what the fuck are you doing? I'm just like oh yeah I'm good. I fell asleep. But we're

14
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:54,969
gonna play Dragon's Dogma. It's one of the things. Also expect a Dreamcast conversation

15
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,780
here in about two seconds. Just about two seconds. Unless we get into the menu of

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Dragon's Dogma. And I think a lot of people are not gonna like the Dreamcast conversation

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,539
because I didn't realize a handful of things about this system.

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:20,300
Two very important things. Important thing number one. A majority of the popular

19
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:28,620
releases for the Dreamcast have been ported to PC and upgraded. We're talking about Shenmue,

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:38,009
Space Channel 5, Knights, Crazy Taxi. They're all on PC. So oh and they look better.

21
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,659
They have a higher graphic fidelity. Uh oh. Problem number two. Actual Dreamcast video

22
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:54,939
games that you would buy on Amazon or eBay. Um some of them are over $150 each because

23
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,180
apparently the Dreamcast collectors it's a pretty big deal because they're pretty rare.

24
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:09,340
So most of the good good Dreamcast games that you can't get on PC that you can only

25
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:20,330
get on Dreamcast. A majority of them are over $50 to $75. Emulation is an option but here's

26
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,009
why I don't like emulating anything past PlayStation 1. Every time I always have some

27
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:33,129
kind of problem. Either it doesn't capture well, frame rate problems, crashes. I every time.

28
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:41,800
The post of PlayStation 1 era of emulators I always have an issue with them. So what I did

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:50,599
is I went ahead and I bought them. I bought a bunch of Dreamcast games. I had in the closet

30
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:58,120
back there already. I didn't buy look I didn't buy any like the $150 ones. Like the ones

31
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:07,990
that are like $125 each. No. But the Dreamcast is going to be one of those scenarios where we

32
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,830
don't just oh hey remember PlayStation 3? It has like 60 fucking games. That's not going

33
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:21,160
to happen. There will be like 10 fun Dreamcast games and I'm not just going to burn through

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,259
them. I'm going to play them. There are a couple of survival horror games that are only on the

35
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,180
Dreamcast that I think would be really fun to see. There are a couple of fighting games.

36
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,100
There are Power Stone is on the Dreamcast and it's a ton of fun. I'm not just going

37
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,779
to play it for five minutes like we did some of the other PlayStation 2, PlayStation 1 games.

38
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,060
Seaman. Yes. The microphone. And by the way the you want to talk about expensive.

39
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:59,189
The Seaman microphone is almost $100. The Dreamcast microphone it's like a piece of plastic

40
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,370
with like a bird shit on the top of it and you stick it into the the VMU thing and it's like

41
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:17,449
70 fucking dollars. Why? Well I think we're really collecting that and there's no other way

42
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:25,029
to get it to work. You have to use it. And speaking of which one of the there's a highly

43
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,189
requested game that I've been seeing in the recommendation channel. People have said it to me

44
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,189
over the course of the last couple of years. I'm finally going to play it. I bought it. I bought

45
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,430
all the necessary stuff to make sure it actually works. I'm going to play Lifeline

46
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,589
for PlayStation 2 and we're going to try to beat that whole game. That's also coming up

47
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:50,279
here. If you don't know what that is that is a it's a game where you control the whole

48
00:05:50,279 --> 00:06:01,430
thing with your voice. Good luck with a Boston accent. Well as you can see I can get

49
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,949
rid of my accent very quickly and very easily and the tone of my voice I can do a standard

50
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:16,009
speaking voice so it should be able to pick up all of the it should be able to pick up

51
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:26,379
all of the things I am saying. Hey take a look at that there's uh there's Dragon's Dogma.

52
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:37,540
Oops why is it not there? Okay now it is. Dragon's Dogma uh this was another one of

53
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:45,220
those that was on the list for a long time. I figured it's it's time to start to play some

54
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,170
of the games on the list. Also also he's been he's been doing research for like two days.

55
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,389
Dark Souls 3. I'm gonna play Dark Souls 3 again at some point over the next week or so.

56
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,269
Well who who cares? Dark Souls 3 what you beat that game like twice on stream. I know

57
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:08,629
I beat the game on stream twice on stream. Uh we're gonna do mods. First person mod comes

58
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:22,629
to mind. I really want to see how that game is in first person so that's what we're gonna do.

59
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:28,870
We also got all the Dreamcast. We got Shenmue. Shenmue is I I got it on PC. We've got crazy

60
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:39,339

61
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:44,550
like 10 of them. Let's see if we can get that started maybe tomorrow like I guaranteed.

Okay so there's uh items that restore health and stim and I'll go with my lantern.

65
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:13,139
Is that the lantern right there? There it is. It's 0.60 cents a small light source.

66
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:21,689
Let me go ahead and use it. Change the game I did. Why does it still say I'm playing Celeste?

Hey you're not even flinching. Doesn't even matter.

87
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:55,299
Uh shouldn't we be a little more scared of this? I'm so confused.

88
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:08,659
This guy has some balls. He just a fire breathing dragon just landed. Screamed at him.

89
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,840
Breathe fire. Blew up a building in front of him and he was still doing the default walk.

90
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,639
Some ledges may be scaled but long fall will end in injury or death.

91
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:31,460
All right well I'm fine. Invoking this stone can gain you new allies known as pawns

92
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:46,039
whose lord that was very fast. Okay

93
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,250
examine. This is a rift stone. A stone etched with a strange marking and maybe used to summon

94
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,899
pawns from beyond. This is like a game show. Do I have to pick one of these two?

95
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,820
As you progress in your adventures pawns will provide you with useful information and hints.

96
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:18,389
All right he's like let's go come on hurry up dude. This is just a tutorial like basic orders.

Take the offensive is our valent against the worms.

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:31,909
That was my voice. Is that me talking? Because we got a healer, we have a bone arrow

99
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,990
and we have shield and sword. We cannot suffer the worm to work any further atrocities.

100
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,870
Careful a goblin. All right a goblin.

101
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,230

So okay this is gonna be a lot of fun. What was the last thing that it just said?

00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:33,110
The survivors come master. So what's it down? Okay down is come to me. I'll go at once.

Wait give me that coin pouch. Oh it's B. I gotta pay attention to that. Oh man why

108
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:59,700

109
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:06,250
clicking LS both during and outside of combat? Okay I think I'm gonna change that.

110
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:22,700
I want to grab him. All right let's like let's steal upon it. Do it.

111
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:30,789
Pardon. Kill this guy. Kill this one. Kill this guy. Please will you kill this guy?

112
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:39,980
I don't even know who you are. Oh he's already dead. All right come let's go hither.

113
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,090
What fucking witch was that?

114
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:11,990
Oh left bumper or right bumper is a weapon skill. Where's it going? Where'd you go? All right come here.

115
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:29,509
So uh hindsight slash. Okay shield summons. Oh there's so many. Link strike. Skyward flash.

116
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,659
Okay this is this is a hold on hold on.

117
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,279
This is fucking cool. Is there a lock-on that I'm gonna miss here?

118
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:16,779
Oh wait he and now you're doing the thing I was just doing. I get you. Thank you. Anything

119
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:26,099
else? What's this? All right I've come to realize I'm the useless party member.

120
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:44,059
I'm the NPC that's just grabbing random things. I still have money though. Don't come we're useless

121
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:51,269
anymore. Do I get to pick my class? This is probably the very beginning right? This is

122
00:17:51,269 --> 00:18:12,730
like the joke beginning. By joke. That was fucking terrible. I feel bad. Good guys, bad guys.

123
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:30,630
All right I got it. Don't worry I'll hold them. What? Shit. Sorry.

124
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm the little brother that got invited to play with the older brother and a couple of his friends.

125
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:48,519
Let's hasten to the dragon's roost. All right hold on. Wait wait wait. Are there any secrets?

126
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,990
That's a pretty good secret.

127
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,980
Arisen this way sir. The worm awaits beyond sir. I should be proud to have you feel it

128
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,180
close by and hidden away here for fear of beasts all around. But with you we cannot suffer

129
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:26,819
a worm to work any further atrocities. Our army is routed. This plain truth. Beyond that grand

130
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:36,309
door the dragon makes its roost. Okay I know it's gonna happen. We're all gonna die.

131
00:19:37,269 --> 00:20:02,140
Oh shit it's a Chimera. No sir Pilate. God is he alive? Here we go. I'll grab him. What am I doing?

132
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:26,940
I've got him on a tail. I've got him. All right so I get to cut the tail off.

133
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:37,690
Is there like an actual dog bowl? Is this just shadow of the closet?

134
00:20:38,490 --> 00:21:07,180
Get back over to the snake. No don't get on the goat head. Oh my god. Tamed it. Super gimmick.

135
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:23,349
Poisoned whinies. Everyone's dying. Icons.

136
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm getting on top and I'm hitting them in the head again. Right in the goat head.

137
00:21:44,359 --> 00:22:04,170
What? You're not gonna hold him still. I just look let's all hold him. Not even a half health.

138
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:25,769
All right be rid of the tail. You must kill the tail. All right right in the belly.

139
00:22:26,970 --> 00:23:00,099
Right in the head. A symbol. Well I'm the party tank.

140
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,940
Goat's head's almost dead. I'm gonna climb up.

141
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:34,390
Goat's head has been killed. Get up there. Oh get up.

142
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,009
This is actually monster hunter. It kind of is.

143
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:10,470
This is just monster hunter but you don't have friends.

144
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:31,660
There are no. Wait is there online? All right. All right. All right. John. John. I think you got

146
00:24:51,380 --> 00:25:00,859
game. There's an MMO version of this game in Japan only. I told you that was gonna happen.

147
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,500
And countless lifetimes come to pass. This is where I get to make my character. I'm gonna

148
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:32,569
be a wizard. That was by Andre De Regio. Uh-oh. The hell portal has opened.

149
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:45,619
Didn't even get to meet the dragon. Quick get the tail.

150
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,740
Oh the bird's gonna be yelling random lines at each other.

151
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:12,519
His skin is like armor. Go for the tail. What? What's it doing? Is that what a meteor looks

152
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:26,730
like? Oh it's a dragon meteor. I get it. I was just trying to do a cannonball and you

153
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:37,690
fucking birds got in the way. I was gonna get a ten at a tenth. New smash character. Yeah.

154
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:47,990
Benedict Cumber Smug. Yeah I don't know why that's so quiet because it's pre-rendered.

155
00:26:47,990 --> 00:27:00,140
Here we go. All right. Here we go. Character edit. Height. Weight. View poses. All right.

156
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,180
Not bad. Not bad. Okay I'm gonna make the most default standard wizard you could ever make.

157
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,019

162
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,339
Blandalf. No I'm not gonna do a Lord of the Rings thing.

163
00:28:39,240 --> 00:29:10,940
Carthor. Garthor. Garth. How do I get out of here? No Garthor. There you go.

164
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,509
Garthor. The noble wizard Garthor. That's fucking perfect. All right well how do I do I can't how

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:38,839
players with parental controls enabled. What? Is there a Garthor already?

167
00:29:45,930 --> 00:30:05,880

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:24,039
a base body. There's too many. There's too many base bodies. Garthor. But you can call me Gene.

169
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:39,130
Yeah that's a pretty good Garthor I would say. Yeah all right that's the base. That's just the

170
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,369
Boomer emote. It is not. Select a voice.

171
00:30:48,569 --> 00:31:01,369
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Maybe. Possible. No. Good.

172
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:07,670
Good. That's this one I think.

173
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,400
No I'm not gonna do the goofy chipmunk baby voice.

174
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:34,980
That one's much better. No. I'm not doing the streamer voice. I'm not doing the

175
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,900
youtuber streamer voice. You understand? Let's go through this. Ready?

176
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,759
So let's take a look at the voices here. Okay. Sounds pretty gruffy. That's pretty good man.

177
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:55,160
Not bad. Deep and low. I'm not like that much of a uh. This is the one.

178
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,480
Oh my god. Yep. Every video you've ever watched has that. Every single one. Every single

179
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:13,400
video has that in that. Uh proceed. Wait wait wait wait wait. Hold on. Wait wait wait.

180
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:23,319
Back back back back. More detailed edits. New preset face will overwrite the current

181
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:39,339
face selection. There we go. Like the beard and the hair.

182
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:14,950
It's not literally Gandalf. Okay. This is. I don't even remember his name. Barth?

183
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:23,539
What's this guy's name? I like this one. Hold on I gotta see more of him.

184
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:42,970
Let's go into details here. Size. No. View expressions.

185
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,720
Well. Oh my goodness. All right. Should I make him uh like a. Should he be like a

186
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:17,590
green? Frog? No no more frogs. Like undead? No no no. He has to stay. No no no. I'm just

187
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:33,219
gonna make him. What a Gandalf. Gandalf looks like this right? Gandalf was not green.

188
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:43,110
All right. Face shape. Can I do anything else besides the. Okay eyes. I gotta pick the right

189
00:34:43,110 --> 00:35:08,550
ones. Oh my god. That's fucking terrifying. I feel like this is the next John Wick movie.

190
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,380
They're gonna. You think they're gonna stop at three? No. They're gonna make a John

191
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:30,519
Wick 4 and it's gonna be when he's like fucking 75. Yeah they better have a blue star

192
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:40,059
wizard robe option or I'm leaving. Me too. I will exit the game. Hmm this is tough.

193
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:50,039
Uh I like. I like these ones. No these ones are way better. Those are my actual eyes.

194
00:35:52,599 --> 00:36:04,519
That's what my visor actually looks like. That's kind of scary. Okay vertical spacing.

195
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:31,940
All right. No I'm not gonna make. What's the. What's that movie? Uh Attila? No that's not.

196
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,340
No not Attila. I'll. I'm not making an Alita character okay. That's gonna be a weird movie

197
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:55,619
to watch. This is just a bird. Yeah Alita battle angel. Fine. What does Alita's eyes.

198
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:17,800
What color does Alita have for eyes? Is it red? Okay here we go. Looks good. Okay brows.

199
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:40,230
That does not fit. This this is a head transplant. Okay can I do details? Yeah

200
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:52,809
vertical spacing. This is gonna be a very very odd reference but maybe somebody will.

201
00:37:53,369 --> 00:38:08,070
Is this Dr. Parnassus? Does anybody know who that is from that movie? That's a movie that

202
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:23,429
nobody saw but that this is just Dr. Parnassus. That looks good. Look at all these pictures.

203
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:38,420
These are all so fucked up looking. No no I'm not. No he's not. He's not getting a.

204
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,610
He's not getting a cute nose. Sorry. He has to get like a dwarf nose.

205
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:04,090
Actually I kind of liked it the way it was. Maybe one. Yeah right there.

206
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:26,150
Like right in the middle. All right looks good. Mouth is important. This is uh what you're looking

207
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:34,389
at here is a great crazy grandpa got your iPhone and was taking a selfie but accidentally because

208
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:55,380
he's so old took the shutter take a hundred photos button. Do details on this one. Boy

209
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:08,250
that's not bad. I think that's fine. Ears. You can't even see the ears.

210
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:20,539
What? No it's not gonna. It should be maybe an elf. No Gandalf wasn't an elf. All right.

211
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:30,760
Hairstyle. Let me look at this one more time. Details. Okay 24 is the right one. Or is it?

212
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,590
Okay can you give can you give them can you give characters in this game to see a haircut?

213
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,349
Is it possible? I don't think it is.

214
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:22,889
You can change the hair later. See ya. See a haircut. No I don't. No no no.

215
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:36,380
All right just keep going. Preset bodies.

216
00:41:51,219 --> 00:42:10,170
Give him a huge jacked body. No that doesn't work like that. He can he can this character

217
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:18,579
can stay in Ren and Stimpy where he belongs. My character is gonna be no that's too easy.

218
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:32,389
It's too easy to just make like a fat guy or I'm huge you know. I mean I have to keep him

219
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:42,550
normal but out of shape normal. Wait I can make it what? Oh I thought you could change

220
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:54,710
just the color of his like chest. Okay that's fine. Statue. Height.

221
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:06,309
No we're gonna make him normal okay. No we're not gonna make him huge. We're gonna make him

222
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:24,340
normal. 141 centimeters is how tall? That's what? That's four foot nine. Is this inches?

223
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:34,300
No that's we're gonna keep him normal. Not small. We're gonna keep him in the normal range.

224
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:55,940
This is fine. This is normal. Weight. Okay. Musculature. Pretty good. Torso. Now fucking

225
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:04,550
with the torso fucks with the way you've made his face. Although I do really like the coat

226
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:28,340
hanger though. Not realistic. We'll have to go for two. Two's fine. So all right should I just

227
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:37,659
make jacked dad? This is jacked dad body. You know the guy that's like in his late 40s

228
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,860
and can't wait to go to the resort pool to take the shirt off because he has like really defined

229
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:54,550
shoulders. A fat stomach. And like a big chest. Yeah I think I'm gonna make resort casino dad.

230
00:44:55,269 --> 00:45:11,769
Yeah I gotta go back to the stomach. Where is it? Torso?

231
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:32,329
No where was it? It was back. Statue? Okay here it is. No it needs to be less defined.

232
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:59,289
That's that's better. There we go. Huge fucking arms. Although this is this is pretty good resort

233
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:06,539
casino dad too because some they don't even work out your arms. You just do you just do like

234
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:24,780
curls and and then you do like the chest. No this is perfect. No that's much better. Not

235
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:32,360
another frog. Is he just he is turning into a frog isn't he? Wicked skinny legs. No I'm not

236
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:40,650
gonna do one of the fat ones. We've been doing Kenshi body again. No these are good. All right

237
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:54,539
I'm gonna fix this. I'm not doing Kenshi body. I promise. See? I told you I wasn't gonna do

238
00:46:54,539 --> 00:47:13,320
Kenshi. Stance. No nobody has posture that good. It hurts to have posture like this.

239
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:33,369
That's fine. Stance. Ladylike or macho? All I'm doing is just lifting my arms up a little

240
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:47,860
and giving myself duck feet. How's that do? You want to learn how to be macho? Just raise your

241
00:47:47,860 --> 00:48:00,889
hands up a couple of degrees above your waist and then pivot your toes. Okay and it features

242
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:21,130
scars, wrinkles, facial hair. This is actually pretty detailed. Oh no scars. That that implies

243
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,809
that I that implies that I may have lost a battle. Oh I haven't even been touched.

244
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:48,170
I'm untouchable. Nobody can hit me. Boy that's all right. 23. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I

245
00:48:48,170 --> 00:49:16,179
don't I no get the beard back. It's the hair. It's the hair that's doing that. This hair just

246
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:27,610
is so terrible. All right that's fine. The beard we had before was perfect. I think that's

247
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:44,460
just enough beard. I think. What else we got? I don't like this character. I think this is

248
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:52,869
perfect. Wait hold on. Details? All right so we can do the reverse youtuber if you want.

249
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:11,210
No no no no. Look if you can't dye your hair when you're 75 years old you can dye your

250
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:36,969
beard. Okay I think we're good. Makeup. Okay I can't really see anything. Adjustment.

251
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:49,289
Give him a cool scar. No he didn't. That implies that I was injured ever in a fight. Okay we got

252
00:50:51,019 --> 00:51:01,320
Garthord. Jean Garthord or Jean. Male. Type 10. This is perfect. This is going to be the best

253
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:08,340
wizard you've ever seen. No scars means you didn't fight at all. No no scars means that I

254
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:16,300
have never been hit. I'm unhittable. You take a gigantic swing. You you pull back with

255
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,579
all of your might and you swing straight down and nope you're not going to hit me.

256
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:38,679
I've never been hit by a blade or an arrow or a magical spell. Pretty good. I'm ready.

257
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:52,659
I'm ready to play. Yes I'm ready to play. Make him fat. No no we can't. That's the

258
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:58,500
trope we can't go down on this channel. If there was like a germa trope it would be

259
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,889
character has to be very fat, very small, and very old. We have to at least try a different

260
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:15,289
character for once. No like old fat guy. I'm okay with old small guy. We can't do the three

261
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:27,380
strikes. Three strikes. Make him two. He's two. He's way too small. Is he? Then how small did

262
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:41,130
I make him? No I had him like today like every day. Waves gently lapped at the bike.

263
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:56,710
Didn't even let me read it. This is me. I can't wait till they do the camera pan. Yep.

264
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:11,019
Oh what a beautiful day in my village. Look at that pool over there. Nice resort that we're at.

265
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:16,710
I can't wait to take my shirt off and go swimming. But what I do is a dad on vacation

266
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:23,400
and smoke a bunch of cigarettes too even though I don't even smoke cigarettes.

267
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:54,619
I love the voice. You guys said I was small. I'm not even small. Look at all these people

268
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:22,519
around me. I am as tall as almost everybody here. See? I towered over that guy. I want you to pause

269
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:26,039
that and I want you to look at put a ruler up on your screen and see how tall I am.

270
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:40,650
Again untouchable. He was aiming for me. Who's that uh Marvel character that has so much luck

271
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:54,019
that you can never they can't even get hurt? Lucky. What is it? Domino. Yeah that's my

272
00:54:54,019 --> 00:55:22,300
superpower. Unable to get hurt. Here we go. Where is he? Where is the human?

273
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:58,440
Unhittable. I can do whatever I want. Nobody fucking hits. Carport. Almost hit. Nope. He almost

274
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:14,059
hit me. God damn it. My first scar. Got me right in the shoulder. What the heck.

275
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:38,280
Does he know? He knows. I'm gonna get a whole lot more of these scars.

276
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:01,719
I don't know what you're saying. I'm sorry. I've got I don't know if this is what your

277
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:05,880
ancient prophecy is.

278
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:56,230
No don't eat it. Oh no. So I get it.

279
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:01,269
The dragon ate my heart. I have to get my heart back from the dragon.

280
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:20,070
So I need a band of adventurers and a band of merry merry merry. I get it. Pretty good Kingdom

281
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:46,090
Hearts opening theme song. Where the fuck is Goofy? Is Donald gonna show up? Scar.

282
00:58:48,949 --> 00:59:03,579
God damn it. That's a big one. Take up arms. Fight. Fight.

283
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:22,250
You're in the chef's house. It's time for you to begin your journey as Artisan.

284
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,889
Arisen. But before you can win your heart back from the dragon you'll need to prepare.

285
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,150
Take a weapon. Oh this is where I'm gonna choose my Mickey Mouse path.

286
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:50,920
Do you like friends? Are you strong? Are you smart? Here we go. Your vocation determines

287
00:59:50,920 --> 01:00:03,050
your basic attributes, wieldable equipment, and skills. Fighter. Strider. Mage. Primary weapon.

288
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:11,500
He's gonna be a two-handed wielding double-bladed axe. All right. Basic vocation to conjure of

289
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:18,760
magics to heal wounds and target elemental weaknesses. Looses a ball of fire that explodes

290
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,400
upon contact. Invokes a magical sigil which recovers the health of those who enter.

291
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:36,360
This is Doomage. Take on mage as a vocation. Well that's the character I made.

292
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:44,570
You can equip yourself with a primary and secondary weapon. Primary weapons such as

293
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:48,650
swords and daggers are combat essentials. Secondary weapons like bows and shields offer

294
01:00:48,650 --> 01:01:01,099
support. Did I just air zooka? Oh wow. Okay I'm so happy I got the air zooka.

295
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:19,559
How do I what do I do? How long does it take to cast?

296
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh okay that okay that's how long it takes to cast.

297
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:40,019
You can hold it and then you can target it. I get it. Okay oh you bet you target an area

298
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:49,929
and you just stand at it. I get it. Okay so air zooka. Fireball. You just release to shoot.

299
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,659
Okay let's go.

300
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,599
They're already talking about it. Fuck.

301
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,760
The one thing that he was good at, the one thing that he told everybody.

302
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,170
Not anymore. He's a loser now.

303
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:25,960
The only reason why we thought he was cool was because he was never hit.

304
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,480
He didn't even have any powers. We can't sell that. The tourism will drop.

305
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:58,739
Give me some dialogue. Quest successful. Defeating foes and completing quests earns

306
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:03,300
you experience and each level gained raises all of your attributes. Press start to bring

307
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,139
up the pause menu where you can check your attributes, a full map, quest information, and

308
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:31,460
more. Oh my god. Well hopefully that didn't mess anything up later. Kneecaptor. Look at

309
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:41,670
all these berries and apples and oranges. Let's sheet this so I don't get any more trouble.

310
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:56,710
Is it broom? Can I pick up the broom? Come on. What the hell is this even for? Okay what can

311
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:08,579
I do with a broom? Why did I pick up a broom? This is probably heals. Who made this Capcom?

312
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:11,380
Okay so those are those are those are resident evil herbs. They have to be.

313
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:31,260
All right let's go. Cassardist. Progress through the game by completing quests.

314
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:36,059
Always talk with the people you meet. They'll surely... people who bear an icon above their

315
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,909
head possess special information. Those bearing green icons have new quests to offer.

316
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:53,050
Look at this beautiful world. Beautiful game. This is why they put this here. You come

317
01:04:53,050 --> 01:05:31,559
down you see the fantastic landscape. This is awful. Worse than I feared. Present. My thanks.

318
01:05:37,590 --> 01:06:02,539
This is awful. You can't pick people up. He didn't like the pie. Well it was a free pie.

319
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:08,760
Well you can't get mad at a free pie. Would you get mad if somebody gave you a free pie

320
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,639
no matter what the quality was? It could be absolute awful quality, but if it was free

321
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:20,250
then who cares? There's talk of monsters emerging from the shadows all along the shore.

322
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:28,579
Nasty things too. The brine they call. They say there are many and yet one. Seems this brine

323
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:34,039
can be bested what's more. Not to do but avoid the water's edge. What does somebody

324
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:42,869
give you a pile of shit? Performing actions that people dislike will decrease their

325
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:48,309
affinity for you. This is the guy that wanted the pie, huh? This was the pie tutorial.

326
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:55,380
All right, look at the height difference here. This guy's like 6'4". This is not that small,

327
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:04,650
right? This is like, that's not that small. If this guy's like 6'1", this was, this is like

328
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:14,659
6 feet versus 5'11". I don't know what it is to some of you guys in this chat. Anything

329
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:22,300
under like 6'5", is tiny apparently to a lot of people here. If you're not over like 6'2",

330
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:28,949
apparently you're like a puny tiny person. Where do you guys live?

331
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:48,199
America. Purchasing equipment and useful items from shops or wandering merchants you encounter

332
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:53,820
on your travels. You can do that. Didn't somebody say I had too much money? Let's burn it.

333
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,949
You can restore health and stamina and advance the passage of time at any inn or

334
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:03,510
resting place. This game looks, I feel like this game is going to be a lot of fun.

335
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:13,079
I'm sorry. Wait, come here! Come here! Oh, that was a full baseball swing in the face.

336
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:22,220
Can I use this inn ever again? It's a false swing. That would kill someone.

337
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:29,880
Is this stealing? Some items can be combined with others to produce surprising results.

338
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:38,439
Experiment and see what you can come up with. A game where you can steal and there's no

339
01:08:38,439 --> 01:09:01,319
consequences. I already like it. I don't know why I'm burning this guy's bed. There's no reason

340
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:13,239
for it. Tiny pillow. All right. I will agree with you. That pillow is very small. Okay.

341
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,539
Do the math though. This is a standard bed. If I were to lie down in this bed right now.

342
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:23,579
So let me line it up so my head would die. My head's not going to touch it.

343
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:31,159
Okay. My head would touch that pillow right here. Maybe like right here. If I lie down

344
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:43,300
straight. This bed is huge. Look at how big this bed is. Nothing to do with how tall the

345
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:54,890
character is. Rock. Well, they have resident evil crates too. It's an inn. All right.

346
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,250
There's a stone over here. Isn't that one of those wishing stones where I can wish

347
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:14,279
for a friend? Wish for like an ally? Empty flask. Okay. Let's put this away.

348
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:24,949
I just kind of like looking around. Your character is five two. The character's not

349
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:35,180
five two. It's five like eight. Barn. Where's this uh wish? There it is. Examine.

350
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:43,689
There ought there. There's ought there. As wrought there. Was that like a very strong

351
01:10:43,689 --> 01:11:10,659
English accent? There is the first combat mission. What? Am I supposed to know who this is?

352
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:25,260
He's got a scar too. Wait a minute. We were both scarless at one point? That's not him.

353
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:33,800
He's of the pawn legion. They come from some unknown place. Just appear without a warning.

354
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:43,340
They're a strange lot. Not human. Quite. They look the part sure enough but they lack the will.

355
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:50,869
The spark what drives us. They have no capacity to feel nor act alone. So they live as

356
01:11:50,869 --> 01:11:57,720
sellswords. That's gonna be the middle name of my first child.

357
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:06,739
Brandon sellsword elbertson. So you know I'm a fan of game of thrones, you know?

358
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:26,340
Second germa sellsword elbertson. I already hate your kid.

359
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:35,029
Why don't you take him? Might be you learn out of why he came to you in the first place.

360
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,539
Available quest change as you progress through the game. Additionally you can always consult

361
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:47,500
the quests section of the pause menu for your current objectives. People with red

362
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:52,380
icons appearing over their head have information relevant to your priority quest. If you have

363
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,539
several quests ongoing at the same time you can set one as priority in the quest section

364
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,180
of the pause menu. What's going on with the throat today? I don't know.

365
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:06,890
Doing so will make all people, places, and things relevant to the priority quest appear

366
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:11,779
prominently on your minimap. That's good. Pawns in your party will also offer advice

367
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:20,539
for the priority quest more often than for other quests in your log. Okay. To truly know

368
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:24,859
what arisen are meant to do it is likely best to follow the pawns lead. But you've

369
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:29,020
got information for me. That pawn will be looking to head west with the attempt.

370
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:34,859
Why don't you see? Oh fuck. He'll not make the trip his kindle rot where they stand.

371
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:40,949
Okay he's following me. Why not see that pawn to the encampment?

372
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:50,020
Might be you'll find art there as well. I thanks. You have a knife. All right this

373
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,500
guy didn't even introduce himself. Purchasing equipment here in Cassadis will make for a

374
01:13:54,500 --> 01:14:15,689
safer trip to the encampment. Sell or is it where's the what do you buy? You look well.

375
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:27,020
Is there like a general store? Wait hold on. Hold on. Can I put him in the well?

376
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:42,710
This is not possible right? Oh it's boarded up. God damn it. Why do they give you this kind

377
01:14:42,710 --> 01:15:07,189
of power? He's slapping your butt. Why am I doing this? There's no point in what I'm doing.

378
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:09,050
This is not gonna even do anything.

379
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:45,479
He comes back right? That guy comes back. He doesn't respawn. There's no oh you're

380
01:15:46,439 --> 01:16:12,310
companion respawn. Actually gone forever. The game has permadeath so that guy actually is gone

381
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:32,979
forever. Fuck him. I don't need him. Oh my god. Can I just get a new one? Is this the

382
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:51,029
purchased a guy vending machine? Come on. I need another person. Well I'm gonna listen

383
01:16:51,029 --> 01:17:00,300
to his advice and I'm gonna buy some supplies. Who gives a shit about that guy? That guy

384
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:11,289
wasn't gonna do anything anyways. This this game's fucking cool. Why did it take me so

385
01:17:11,289 --> 01:17:20,069
long to play this game? This game is fucking interesting. Wait lantern. No get the lantern

386
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:37,180
not the empty flask. What am I even picking up? You already have one. Is it this is not a

387
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:48,779
lethal fall right? Is it? I'm just I don't know. I'm just gonna climb. No that's not

388
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:54,420
lethal though. All right let's take a look at the map. After accepting a quest first

389
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,020
note the quest marker in your map then continue by searching for the quest. That guy's actually

390
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:02,340
gone. Is this like a joke that people are doing by the way? Or is this he's actually

391
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:13,210
gone forever. There's permanent death. Quest markers will be buried. If you've

392
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,640
got one and want to progress through another you may find a solution in your initial

393
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:25,800
problem. Okay so where's the where's the shop? Pablo's Inn, Riftstone. What about this is?

394
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:48,810
Barn. Is it the inn? Did I permadeath that guy too? All right now that I know that there's

395
01:18:48,810 --> 01:19:02,460
okay grocery store. Thanks for the groceries. There's nobody here. Steal from register

396
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:13,779
wherever the register is. Okay I got it. Okay I'm just taking all this guy's money.

397
01:19:16,069 --> 01:19:33,779
Let's fuck the whole place up. You know what I mean? Never mind. Is he he sleeps oh

398
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:41,220
fisherman's house. What did I just did I just put a fairy in there?

399
01:19:41,220 --> 01:20:03,859
Well this is not Legend of Zelda. Flask of oil. Okay I'm telling you guys I'm feeling it. I'm

400
01:20:03,859 --> 01:20:13,289
feeling the bug from this game. Yeah sometimes you can just tell. I can just tell. I like this

401
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:17,130
game a lot and I haven't even played it for like five minutes. Actually I played for what?

402
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:23,050
How long has it been? An hour and 20 minutes? No it has not been an hour and 21 minutes.

403
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:26,869
That's how you can tell that I think the game is fun. I thought it's been I thought it

404
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:34,340
was like seven minutes ago is when I turned the stream on. Why not see that pawn to the encampment?

405
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:42,819
He's dead. Can you come with me instead? I need a like a shot. Here we go. Oh hello. Hello. It's

406
01:20:42,819 --> 01:20:49,779
a mercy so much to the village was spared. I only wish I had more to offer. Okay curatives,

407
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:57,579
tools. How much is this stuff? It's overwhelming. Okay do I need an axe?

408
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,920
No I'm not gonna baseball swing her in the face with my fucking walking stick.

409
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:20,840
What do we got for armor? Leather cap traveler's hood. Well how much is it? What is it? What does

410
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:27,180
this do? What does this do for a feathered leather cap thick enough to protect the head

411
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:39,829
from mishaps? Location, magic, defense, defense. What does it even look like? Oh it's on there

412
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:43,909
now. Okay I thought that was my hair. This thing is so stupid. This is made out of like

413
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:57,460
newspaper. Wait do I add it to cart like it's amazon? I do. Why don't more games do that?

414
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:02,890
How long when did this fucking game come up? The add this item to cart and then check your

415
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:14,470
cart out. You gotta be kidding me. Why do is this not in other games? All right let's see

416
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:23,899
traveler's shirt. Let's take a look at the defense hemp shirt. Defense four, defense five.

417
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:29,720
This one's not bad. This one's expensive though. I don't have enough money. Maybe just

418
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:34,890
get a shirt and a hat. I think that's what I'm gonna do. Let's take a look at the

419
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:41,939
checkout. Cap and hat. I got plenty of money. Okay keep that in the checkout. Wait tunic.

420
01:22:42,579 --> 01:23:02,069
No that's fine. Gloves. Got defense 70, 88. Funny bone guards. Minus one percent striking

This is look at how much better this is. 132 magic? Yeah it's only a thousand bucks.

Add it to the cart. This is gonna turn out like every single amazon order I've ever had.

436
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:17,560
staff. So I can let me see what it looks like. Cool all right it's a nice dinosaur bone.

437
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:30,810
Put it on. Equip. Put the dumb hat on. I've got what is this? Set of fisherman's tatters.

438
01:25:31,449 --> 01:25:51,979
Traveler's shirt. A pleb shirt really. There's tights and I'm gonna sell the rest.

439
01:25:52,539 --> 01:26:03,350
So let's sell. I just didn't I what about a rock? Well you can throw the rocks never mind.

440
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:13,189
Didn't I steal a bunch of shit from somebody's house? Yeah just I don't just take that.

441
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:21,739
Herb bucket. Yeah see look. I want this stuff. I just took it to sell it.

442
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:32,310
Rusted staff. Get rid of it. I wonder if this this is shit matter. This doesn't like improve

443
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:43,239
your fishing by like five percent right? You know some games have that kind of shit. You have

444
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:49,159
to wear this. Wear the full set of fisherman's outfit. Your lore is better. All right let's go.

445
01:26:51,210 --> 01:27:08,199
Uh yep. Didn't I have something else too? Item storage. Whose is this? Item storage.

446
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:32,060
This is my stuff? How is this my stuff? Why is it $2,600 to take my stuff out of storage?

447
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:54,279
Wait wait wait. This is selling. 312,000 gold. Wait why is this like this? Why does this stuff

448
01:27:54,279 --> 01:28:09,539
exist? This is the DLC stuff. That's kind of unfair. I could get myself like more than a

449
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:24,039
quarter of a million dollars right now. More than that. Well how do I pull it out? Bye.

450
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:44,229
This shit ain't even in here. What the fuck is all this stuff? I need to go to the end to get

451
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:51,579
it out. No I don't want to do that. That's cheating. I'm just gonna pretend those don't

452
01:28:51,579 --> 01:29:00,819
exist. I'm ready to go on my adventure, but I need to go to my equipment. All right how do I?

453
01:29:07,699 --> 01:29:18,729
Is there like a certain way I can make it? I can heal. Can I touch the stone?

454
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:30,420
No. It's gotta go. I'm going and I'm gonna be ready and I'm gonna fucking attack herbs and

455
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:42,140
spells. Assign items to buttons. Where do I do that? Status? Map? Options? Status? Skills.

456
01:29:42,859 --> 01:30:01,609
Okay here we go. Hold on. So I have to heal. Condition. Oh okay here we go. So this is a common

457
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:11,399
herb used in preparing and consuming. Okay it's uh sort or how do I put this? Use combine.

458
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:21,510
I can't combine with it. How do I hotkey it? Is there a way I can make this on the hotkey?

459
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:31,779
Because I just have use. You can't set shortcuts for items. Okay. You can only hotkey

460
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:55,220
it on the keyboard. Finally you set up permanently dead huh? Oh permanently dead. He's back.

461
01:30:56,779 --> 01:31:15,899
Game saves automatically. You can also save manually. Uh all right I will heal you. Come

462
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:32,760
here. I just tried to heal you. Will you let me do this please? Right there. All right just

463
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:43,180
hang out in there for a second. This is a very slow heal. Throw them off the cliff.

464
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:54,579
I'm not gonna throw this guy off the cliff. Uh oh goblins.

465
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:07,670
Save the peddler. Attack while holding. You have weapon skills. You can dash. Yes I know how to

466
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:19,100
dash. You gotta pawn because this is the right knowledge and skills. They're able to assist

467
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:31,939
in tandem attacks. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Oh wait a minute. Hold on.

468
01:32:31,939 --> 01:32:47,399
Why am I? Why are my things on fire? My air is on fire. We have triumphed. When foes seem to be

469
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:51,880
too much to handle try gaining levels or obtaining better equipment. Can this guy gonna

470
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,739
give us money? That was far through. I'm called Reynard. A traveling salesman. Though

471
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:03,420
those damnable beasts ruined my wares. Oh I'm sorry for that. But thanks to you it was only

472
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:15,670
wares I lost. He just like you just gnomed that guy and he ran away. I can't even attack that

473
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:23,130
guy now. They often come across rare items not found at stationary shops. If you see a peddler

474
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:32,380
make sure to check what they have to offer. Um well I can't do that anymore. Thanks. Thanks

475
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:49,699
guy. Gob. Gob. All right let's check this place out. Empty flask.

476
01:33:55,449 --> 01:33:59,930
All right so we can go. What about down here? No yeah that's it. That's just fall off.

477
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:08,979
Right. Are we gonna fall off if we go down here? What was that? This stretch of road is

478
01:34:08,979 --> 01:34:13,060
called the Menomia trail. No give me that. Why are you picking the rocks up? This looks

479
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:23,579
interesting. Stop. That's my stuff. A wealth of useful items can be found by vanquishing monsters.

480
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:32,569
Get the fuck out of here. That's mine. Just fighting over fucking mines again in veins

481
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:44,260
like in Warcraft. What's this? You can use materials. Let's just keep going. Time for

482
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:48,899
them to throw them off the cliff. No I'm not gonna throw them off the cliff. He's too useful

483
01:34:48,899 --> 01:35:06,359
for me right now. Not yet. Search the log. Cedar branch.

484
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:24,939
Small nut. Did you just skin the tree? I guess I could just sprint. I want to change that to

485
01:35:24,939 --> 01:35:30,439
something else. A different button. What could I make that? I'm not sure I can make it anything.

486
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:38,859
I don't like pushing left stick in. What are you? Why did you do that?

487
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:46,630
What the fuck did you do that for? What is he doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?

488
01:35:47,430 --> 01:36:02,899
This is definitely, this is like a player right? No I'm not gonna throw them up. What are you

489
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:16,920
doing? We both keep having the same idea. Chests are full of articles and treasures of great value.

490
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:27,819
Yeah the Vandal brothers. Silencer arrows. Cool. Many a life was ended by falling from two

491
01:36:27,819 --> 01:36:36,680
greater heights. We gotta convince them to let us in. All right we got front door. We got back

492
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:53,479
door. Are we allowed in here? If memory serves. What the hell? All right so somebody's speaking

493
01:36:53,479 --> 01:37:03,479
out of the Riftstone. Follow me. That was the Wendy's girl.

494
01:37:14,069 --> 01:37:24,020
That was a good one. Have all you need. We are in first and foremost but we offer more than

495
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:30,020
simple logic. We can safeguard your belongings and your big any you like. So they can learn,

496
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:37,140
this is where you can learn new skills. Rest for 300 gold. What will it be today? Learn skills.

497
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:49,220
All right I need 200 discipline. Fire boon. Thunder boon. I think I want to be electricity.

498
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:59,739
What was Gandalf? Nothing. I don't think, did Gandalf ever do a spell? He did like a light,

499
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:05,000
big thing of bright lights for like one second. He didn't have any ice moves.

500
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:13,989
Didn't have any fucking fireballs. Wasn't even a good wizard. Yeah he did the you shall not

501
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:24,840
pass. It makes like a big bright light. He was a light wizard. Well I can't do anything.

502
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:36,579
He made fireworks. All right let's get it.

503
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:49,159
There's the funny joke where Jerma says dumb things about things he doesn't know.

504
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:59,899
Well I'm like dead serious. What did Gandalf have for spells? He did like bright lights and

505
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:12,899
like a kind of crash through sides right. He did do fire at one point.

506
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:17,750
He could do like a big push yeah like a wind right.

507
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:32,600
What does Goku did besides bright lights? That's a good point.

508
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,939
Is that gonna make another character?

509
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:52,949
It was a theory that he only used as much magic as level two wizard in dungeons and dragons.

510
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:20,359
Well a tireless spirit of self-improvement grants the strength to lead the legion.

511
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:27,369
Gandalf was much more powerful than he let on. His job was to guide the people of middle

512
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:47,289
earth and not do everything for them. You uncultured swine. All right search the area.

513
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,319
My kind grows better able to serve the more we learn.

514
01:40:56,310 --> 01:41:01,979
So what did one of these. Sorry I was having a Lord of the Rings argument in chat. What was

515
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:08,779
it? Alas you have yet to prove that if you would prove yourself the arisen show no fear.

516
01:41:08,779 --> 01:41:16,699
Okay so I mean call the arisen. Check the area around the encampment until you find a

517
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:25,369
threat that so I just have to fight a monster. Okay a rift stone. Strange power emanates from

518
01:41:25,369 --> 01:41:42,020
within. Is he gonna follow me? The beast comes. Hurry. When foes are too much to handle.

519
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:58,140
Oh they're not gonna be too much to handle. So he was a light fire wizard.

520
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:05,720
Yeah that's what I was partially correct. Like he has like light and like force like waves and

521
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,920
I was correct. He does have fire.

522
01:42:15,399 --> 01:42:20,659
This is actually this thing's pretty huge. All right get in there.

523
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:32,899
Shit. Climb on a larger monster. What is heavy attack like this? Okay just fire.

524
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:41,699
Okay so as you take damage the amount of health you can recover through magic in the

525
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:46,020
field also decreases indicated by a white bar with the rest of an in.

526
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:52,229
Or use a curative item to fully restore your health. Giving pawns curatives to whole will

527
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:58,069
allow them to use it at their own discretion. There's no reason for me to do that.

528
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:08,149
So if you burn them they'll just they light on fire. I gotta climb up on top. Should

529
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:10,789
I even climb up on top? Should I just stand back and just cast fireballs?

530
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:17,640
Let's get a heal over there.

531
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:37,289
All right I gotta stop. Somebody just said mage gameplay and then they said resident sleeper.

532
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:41,609
I'm a fucking Gandalf all right. So I'm gonna play Gandalf.

533
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:55,659
What? Get away from me. Why did I just leave? What the hell was that?

534
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:01,100
Um all right can I climb and do like a fire bomb in his head?

535
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:27,399
Oh I can like shoot him in the head. Oh fuck. This is a lot of moving around.

536
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:39,979
How do I hit support? All right I gotta hit him right in the other leg.

537
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:49,130
All right now enchant me. Somebody do something.

538
01:44:49,609 --> 01:44:50,649
I shall strike the head.

539
01:44:54,069 --> 01:44:54,869
God damn it.

540
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:07,050
He can't use his arms. Light all of his whole body on fire.

541
01:45:11,029 --> 01:45:16,789
Magic users. Laughing my ass off. Look I'm just I'm gonna be just fine.

542
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,720
Mage gameplay. Don't worry it's gonna be fun. Right in the face. That's what you've got to do.

543
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,970
I gotta just mage him in the face. Just wait till I get the lightning move.

544
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:44,460
Oh shit I'm tired. What a true mage.

545
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,140
I'm a little sleepy right now. I'm gonna cast a fireball at him.

546
01:45:56,729 --> 01:46:02,229
Mage is always terrible. It's not gonna get better. Don't tell me that.

547
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,859
Gandalf is like my favorite character in Lord of the Rings.

548
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:26,359
Mage gets really cool later. Yeah so we're gonna be just fine.

549
01:46:27,079 --> 01:46:36,060
Nothing else. Mage at endgame becomes literal jedi god.

550
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,619
So see everything's gonna be just fine.

551
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:56,550
All right I've proved my worthiness. Early mage gameplay. Resident sleep mode. That's how it

552
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:03,369
always is. Remember Gandalf was level two in Lord of the Rings. He could have done so much

553
01:47:03,369 --> 01:47:07,930
more but he didn't because he wanted to make sure that they they had the trial not him.

554
01:47:09,579 --> 01:47:11,340
A bunch of uncultured swine.

555
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:16,520
Ekba located in the command headquarters of the encampment provides many different support

556
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:22,300
functions to adventurers. Speak with them to rest and heal your wounds. Learn and enable

557
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:28,710
useful weapon skills. Restore excess items. Okay well where's my discipline point?

558
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:39,109
275. All right I can do one. I can get another move. Let's see what they got here.

559
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:44,310
A frazzle. Concentrated field of cold around the user that deals ice damage to whatever foe it

560
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:54,010
touches. It's like a battle mage. Thunder boon. Launches a bolt of magic that enchants an ally's

561
01:47:54,010 --> 01:48:02,140
weapon with thunder so I can enchant his weapon and my own right. Levin. Smites the enemy from

562
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:05,500
above with tongues of lightning especially effective at driving foes out of hiding.

563
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:12,819
Okay it does do my weapon. I kind of think that's cool

564
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:20,970
so I can shoot lightning bolts. This does sound really cool too.

565
01:48:24,739 --> 01:48:28,739
Yeah I'll try this. Tongues of lightning from above.

566
01:48:31,539 --> 01:48:44,340
Mage is a good base for a magic archer. That sounds pretty fun. Levin. Okay I have to change

567
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:55,300
my skills. I don't have any augments. No so I can do that's fireball. We'll just do

568
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:03,770
Levin up here on primary. I can do it's like switching that's like freaking me out here.

569
01:49:04,489 --> 01:49:07,510
Stop doing that. All right Levin is gonna be Y.

570
01:49:09,529 --> 01:49:13,289
What will it be today? Now I'm gonna test it on this guy's skull and see what happens.

571
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:17,720
Have your pick idiot. Come again soon. Let's see.

572
01:49:19,449 --> 01:49:25,859
Levin. I'm just kidding I'm not gonna do that. This game looks fucking awesome.

573
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:32,520
Yeah I mean early game this seems just like there's a lot to do a lot going on.

574
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:34,520
I'm very interested. It's very fun.

575
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:51,989
This is going to the switch? No it's not. It is?

576
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:03,340
The stream's over. I want to play this in bed on the switch.

577
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,939
So thanks for watching everybody. Just kidding.

578
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:09,739
They tell some you and you to share your heart.

579
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:20,390
So this is I'm gonna make another character. Oh god set the look of your constant companion

580
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:34,680
throughout your journey has arisen your main pawn. This is important. This is kenshi. Another

581
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:40,939
hour incoming. No no no no no. We're gonna get this done very quickly. Okay uh another

582
01:50:40,939 --> 01:50:49,510
wizard. Well I'm doing Star Wars A Link to the Past every single I'm gonna have four wizards

583
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:54,569
and we're each gonna be a different element like in that Zelda game. I'm gonna have fire wizard.

584
01:50:54,569 --> 01:50:57,609
I'm gonna have lightning wizard. I'm gonna have ice wizard. I'm gonna have fucking uh

585
01:50:59,739 --> 01:51:14,569
jester like joke wizard. Not a wizard. I can't do like all red robe, blue robe, green robe,

586
01:51:14,569 --> 01:51:24,550
white robe. That would be so interesting. Oh we only get to we only get one. Oh shit one of

587
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:32,460
this has to be a huge guy. I gotta make a huge tank. You can do that but it would be awful.

588
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:47,430
Be smart about this. Oh but I want I want to do like the four links.

589
01:51:56,279 --> 01:51:59,640
You can do it but that only if you're stupid and I hate you. Come on.

590
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:21,850
All right okay here we go. I don't know what the hell that name was

591
01:52:21,850 --> 01:53:11,460
that's why I instantly deleted it. Bob shell. Uh you do jacks. Jinx. Can't make Ronald McDonald.

592
01:53:22,569 --> 01:53:29,369
Mickey D. Oh I hate making characters because I sit here for too long.

593
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:52,439
Shito? I can't make Shito. Shito would have to be a bard for Shito. Is there like song?

594
01:53:53,399 --> 01:54:30,859
Sean. Seth. Sharp. Shelly. Shito. Come on. She. Sean. Smudge. No. Sora. God. I'm gonna turn my mouse

595
01:54:30,859 --> 01:54:36,149
upside down because I think it's it's pulling from yeah I have my mouse has to be upside down.

596
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:43,380
It's gonna be like a musical instrument or something. Siren. That's a musical instrument.

597
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:52,199
Sprinkles. That's fine. All right this is important.

598
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:22,489
Tiny. Very tiny. Yeah but it needs to be skinny. No no no no no no no go back.

599
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:27,130
Go back go back go back go back back back back back. That's not correct.

600
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:49,380
Yeah I mean it really could be any of them. Fine I'll do the joke one. Build. All right I

601
01:55:49,380 --> 01:56:10,729
can do okay now I can do actual editing. Okay detailed edits. Uh let's get body is

602
01:56:10,729 --> 01:56:27,989
most important to happen first. I need small but stretched. Stature. All right height.

603
01:56:28,869 --> 01:56:58,010
Can I do like a custom color? Make it taller? You're gonna make a stick bug.

604
01:56:58,729 --> 01:57:20,010
Can I have like a mask on or something? I don't know if there's an option to do

605
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:48,409
um here. Skinny. Bulky. No. Tiny. That doesn't look right. That's the same person I just

606
01:57:48,409 --> 01:58:04,470
made. No it's gonna be long and skinny. Little tiny arms. Legs long and skinny.

607
01:58:08,569 --> 01:58:23,300
Stance. Straight up. Not just like that. Make Kylo Ren. I'm not gonna make Kylo Ren.

608
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:42,220
Okay facial here. Let's get this off. I'm just clean shaving. This does I know this doesn't look

609
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:51,180
anything. Just wait we gotta give it a second. Hold on. This doesn't.

610
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:57,619
Okay hold on. Faces.

611
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:18,090
I can't do that. It's gotta be this one. Completely bald.

612
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:29,430
Face shape. Gotta have a big wide mouth and just a circle for a head. That's not bad.

613
01:59:30,069 --> 01:59:45,859
That one's not bad. I can make it. That one's okay. Yeah this one. This is like a nice

614
01:59:45,859 --> 02:00:02,310
round face. Eyes have to be just the two dots. I'm gonna just do that. You're making Bobby

615
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:14,970
Hill. I'm not making Bobby Hill. I can make the eyes really small. Okay hold on. This

616
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:19,529
character is gonna be fucking terrible. I'm gonna live with this fucking character forever.

617
02:00:21,739 --> 02:00:32,100
Vertical position down. Spacing. Pretty wide. Size. Small. Eye color. Black.

618
02:00:32,979 --> 02:00:45,340
Okay. Face shape. Is there a way I can add the details? Okay here we go.

619
02:00:50,710 --> 02:01:03,180
The head. It is a little bigger. The eyes. We're gonna get the shape. Brows. No brows.

620
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:18,789
Can I just delete them? Hold on. I think I can. You can't really see them there.

621
02:01:18,789 --> 02:01:29,000
Just make them lighter. Nose. We need to try to get rid of the nose.

622
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:38,939
Is that even possible? Have to get a little one. Vertical position.

623
02:01:40,949 --> 02:02:07,000
It's not possible. This is where we're gonna get. We're gonna get. It's gonna get sold here.

624
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:24,619
Ready? We need a long skinny wide mouth. This is wide as it can get. That is the

625
02:02:24,619 --> 02:03:01,689
widest I can get it. No ears. This didn't work at all. What about like makeup? Can I

626
02:03:01,689 --> 02:03:13,720
add anything? It just has to be. I mean this actually helps a little because

627
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:42,840
Shito's eyes are just black. No that doesn't. This is not bad. It really isn't. Because

628
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:52,500
that's the line for the mouth. That's the the darker eyes. I'm not gonna want to listen to

629
02:03:52,500 --> 02:04:14,869
that. I can't believe I'm doing like the YouTuber joke. How tall is he? He's huge!

630
02:04:32,979 --> 02:04:57,270
All the way tall but he's. He fits in my hand. You know tall and lanky. I mean he is very

631
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:06,899
lanky but he's very tall. He's seven feet tall. All right this is a weird universe.

632
02:05:07,539 --> 02:05:31,449
Fine. Change the voice. Can I change this voice later? That's. You're talking like

633
02:05:31,449 --> 02:05:33,850
four hours from now. You really gonna hear that shit anymore?

634
02:05:33,850 --> 02:05:55,020
That's good. I'm not. I can't handle the baby voice the whole time.

635
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:02,979
Nobody can take that.

636
02:06:12,939 --> 02:06:19,000
I like eight. Eight is just enough annoyance without being annoying.

637
02:06:20,539 --> 02:06:32,229
All right I'm good. Shito. I think that's good to go.

638
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:41,260
Ooh hold on. Hold on. I gotta answer as if I am Shito. So this is important.

639
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:45,819
Your answers will shape your pawn's inclination. When faced with danger which trait would you

640
02:06:45,819 --> 02:07:04,250
most value in a follower? The charisma to lead others. Charisma. Shito sings. While in battle

641
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:10,170
which strategy would you prefer your follower employ? Kill all enemies. Strike at the

642
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:21,510
strongest foe. Rescue comrades in danger. Call for reinforcements. Call. Call or rescue.

643
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:33,819
Shito would never kill anybody. Your follower rescues your party and turns the tide of the

644
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:43,770
entire battle. What would you have them say? This way master. Leave them to me. Now master.

645
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:59,880
Strike the final blow. Quickly. After them. Master strike the final blow. As a ruler which

646
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:03,720
gift would you how would you how happy would you be about one of these options?

647
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:13,130
A magic potion that preserves youth. A brave and just hero to succeed you. The perfect spouse.

648
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:38,869
A majestic white steed. It's not spouse. The perfect spouse. You see the spouse of course.

649
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:48,970
Spouse means a little bit more utility. Spouse is more guardian.

650
02:08:54,090 --> 02:09:04,539
Gandalf has a white horse. This is not Gandalf though. I think I like the utility. White steed.

651
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:20,180
Vocation. Fighter. Strider. Mage. Hmm probably something that can...

652
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:41,500
one of these two. We're gonna get our asses kicked if I do Mage. Bow and arrow. I mean

653
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:50,329
the bow is shaped like his body so the bow it's a bit sad that's what his body looks like.

654
02:09:50,890 --> 02:10:03,510
Don't worry the next character we get is gonna be Danny DeVito and he'll be a tank.

655
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:21,189
Her fealty is sworn to you Arisen. From this day the Legion's men called pawns live and die

656
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:41,510
by your command. Nothing about this is correct. Am I okay I was gonna say what am I supposed to

657
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:48,649
be doing here? Quest successful. Having been reorganized having been recognized as Arisen you've

658
02:10:48,649 --> 02:10:52,649
been granted a loyal pawn to be your constant companion in your journey. In addition to this

659
02:10:52,649 --> 02:10:56,409
main pawn you may hire up to two other pawns to support you in your adventures.

660
02:10:56,970 --> 02:11:00,729
Different pawns have different strengths so you support pawns to tailor your party to

661
02:11:00,729 --> 02:11:06,649
fit your current needs. In addition to minding level and available skills a pawn's knowledge

662
02:11:06,649 --> 02:11:11,210
is another important part of creating an effective party. Pawns with appropriate

663
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:14,810
knowledge of quests or foes can provide helpful advice and battle strategies.

664
02:11:15,930 --> 02:11:34,779
What am I doing? This is a rift a space between realms from which there any and

665
02:11:34,779 --> 02:11:41,159
all manner of pawns may be found. Should one catch your eye speak with the pawn to enlist

666
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:51,960
it to your party. The god of war guy. You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time

667
02:11:51,960 --> 02:12:05,850
they can then be discharged. You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time they can

668
02:12:05,850 --> 02:12:11,500
then be discharged by speaking with them again. Hmm I wonder if I should pick poop butt.

669
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:29,449
I wonder this that's well what a great character that probably is. Level 61 what level

dives through the air while spinning blades extended especially effective when performed

980
03:20:09,559 --> 03:20:16,659
from high places cast out cords to ensnare lightweight foes pulling them to the ground

981
03:20:16,659 --> 03:20:20,979
that's pretty good dashes past the target with blades extended delivering slashes that

982
03:20:20,979 --> 03:20:30,069
can be followed with further slashes now let's get you some like combo shit and a snare

1122
03:51:05,829 --> 03:51:18,180
were they too busy making monster hunter world probably beyond lies the everfall an ancient

1123
03:51:18,180 --> 03:51:22,819
place that sleeps beneath grand soren's stone they did make an online one capcom just hates

1124
03:51:22,819 --> 03:51:34,010
us oh we pawns have long served as keepers of the entrance to this place but since the

1125
03:51:34,010 --> 03:51:41,129
dragons coming a strange aura has filled the everfall uh presence this game has a 33 on

1126
03:51:41,129 --> 03:51:57,940
metacritic no it does not that's not even possible what are you talking about hold on

metacritic dragons dogma metacritic it's kind of like an 80 what are you talking 33 percent

1128
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:22,780
that means the game doesn't even function that's like the game crashes to desktop when you

1129
03:52:22,860 --> 03:52:29,020
open it that's how you get a 33 if it be some omen of evil to come we cannot allow it to go

1130
03:52:29,020 --> 03:52:36,950
unchecked i ask that you seek out the cause of the change the everfall is a place unique

1162
04:00:15,420 --> 04:00:33,260
lightning's not doing so much fire who is dead everyone's getting the ass kicked

1163
04:00:34,139 --> 04:00:47,430

1174
04:02:30,649 --> 04:02:40,200
is dark and unsettling this place all right now that i've opened this door yep

1175
04:02:49,129 --> 04:02:51,290
i wonder what the normie character is thinking

1176
04:02:53,739 --> 04:02:57,420
not probably not very much considering he does have that hat on

1177
04:03:09,000 --> 04:03:14,020
i feel like i'm not doing much damage even with the regular fireball

1178
04:03:14,739 --> 04:03:16,100
melee is gonna take this on here

1179
04:03:25,989 --> 04:03:29,350
he is a normie though that's that that's like the normie hat i don't believe that

04:03:32,700 --> 04:03:44,629
and why am i saying normie okay we got that i can pull that i closed this that's locked now

he's not sorry bringing it back and filling it up again wake stones are miraculous items

1289
04:26:35,209 --> 04:26:41,290
that can bring your character pawn allies or others back to life treasure each wake stone for

1290
04:26:41,290 --> 04:26:47,299
the fragments required to form them are quite rare and each stone can only be used once gather

1291
04:26:47,299 --> 04:26:53,190
enough wake stone shards and they will automatically assemble to form a complete stone deliver a

1292
04:26:53,190 --> 04:27:05,059
wake stone to austin seems no one knows just how he managed to defeat the beast

1293
04:27:06,739 --> 04:27:13,450

asleep what if he just whipped his head up like what the hell all right let's go

1295
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:37,139
where shall we head uh let's take a look so i guess i don't that's not necessarily a quest

1296
04:27:37,860 --> 04:27:54,200
as much as it is just bring one back no i know i guess it is like um no just pointing to me

1301
04:29:02,680 --> 04:29:06,360
we can take on curatives if i'm still having fun and it's still interesting to me then of

1302
04:29:06,360 --> 04:29:12,200
course i'll probably just keep going until i don't necessarily care anymore which i still care now

1303
04:29:15,000 --> 04:29:20,120
why not take the day to walk its streets find your bearings have your pick any you like

04:30:36,180 --> 04:30:56,700
ice boon now i'll get ice boon frazzle that's not bad i'm just i'm gonna have the points

1314
04:31:39,559 --> 04:31:47,319
enabling a gentle landing even from great heights augments the power of magic attacks

1315
04:31:47,319 --> 04:31:54,809
designed to knock down foes negotiate higher prices for items that you sell greatly reduces

salvation that token i gave is a counter side it will mark you as friend to agents of salvation

1430
04:58:49,349 --> 04:58:54,549
may have loosened their tongues as well i hope you'll return to share your findings good

1431
04:58:55,669 --> 04:59:12,729
all right so now i've got to talk to more people okay let's go this leads outside though

1432
04:59:12,729 --> 04:59:15,610
is it just open yeah i don't want to do that yet

1433
04:59:20,250 --> 04:59:29,240
so now i look like a friend do people that are part of the cult

1434
04:59:30,119 --> 04:59:34,040
and then once they become very close friends that's when we do a backstab

1435
04:59:48,200 --> 04:59:59,779
first person is here lady with the pot oh i see we are kindred spirits sir throw off

1436
04:59:59,779 --> 05:00:04,259
building will you be at the gathering then where it is needs to be a high officiant presiding

1437
05:00:05,380 --> 05:00:09,700
not that us lot will be permitted to speak with one in such an office directly mind

1438
05:00:10,659 --> 05:00:21,979
okay there's a meeting going on i just broke her vase i'm not gonna do anything else but i'm

1439
05:00:21,979 --> 05:00:28,540
gonna stick with the same the main quest here they're doing a meeting of the vias

1440
05:00:29,259 --> 05:00:47,299
i guess i do have to go over here can i make it this way by this area feels completely

1441
05:00:50,040 --> 05:00:57,299
seems the castle walls are reached by a flight of stairs ahead the ones that i just took thank you

1442
05:00:57,299 --> 05:01:08,889
for telling me okay there we go say no more friend i must confess i'd not expected the

1443
05:01:08,889 --> 05:01:14,490
arisen to shan salvation's creed though truth be told i'm far from a devout myself

1444
05:01:15,930 --> 05:01:29,340
that's all you got no other information just why is there a chipmunk sub sometimes

1445
05:01:30,860 --> 05:01:42,009
yeah i i mean it's very the game has a character creator and you can make them have very very high

1446
05:01:42,009 --> 05:01:46,490
to very very low voice that's probably very off-putting if you're just joining us

1447
05:01:48,180 --> 05:01:51,619
and trust me it's off-putting to me and i've been here for five hours playing it

1448
05:01:52,180 --> 05:01:58,860
the gatherings to take place down in the catacombs i hear he sounds upset talking about

1449
05:01:58,939 --> 05:02:03,099
me there just far too dangerous a place to brave for a night's diversion

1450
05:02:05,770 --> 05:02:16,520
by the way i didn't make this character i did not make poop but or dude these are

1451
05:02:16,520 --> 05:02:37,209
characters that were given to me that's not a lie that is for real you didn't have to pick

1452
05:02:37,209 --> 05:02:50,459
them oh yes i did whoa don't do that oh seeker's token it's not gonna hurt that bad is it

1453
05:02:53,080 --> 05:03:01,669
can i run and jump and grab the ladder no definitely not that's such a germa joke it's

1454
05:03:01,669 --> 05:03:20,700
not my character though i swear to god i would hurt a lot all right let's go if only you could

1455
05:03:20,700 --> 05:03:41,159
levitate what's this doing here the hell did this put me why did it bring me out here uh do we

1456
05:03:41,240 --> 05:03:41,639
swim

1457
05:04:07,380 --> 05:04:12,020
must have washed up here what how convenient water too deep or idle too long in the water

1458
05:04:12,020 --> 05:04:27,110
you'll fall unconscious so why the hell did it want me to come up this way oh what it's all

1459
05:04:27,110 --> 05:04:50,150
the way over here it so i have to go the other way because it was an exit it will point you to

1460
05:04:50,150 --> 05:04:58,299
any exit okay so that's not where i need to go though like i gotta go up here like up

1461
05:04:58,299 --> 05:05:33,430
there and out so we need to go out that way not out here to the ocean ride a horse

1462
05:05:33,430 --> 05:05:59,610
horse no don't do that not the horse part that part what i don't even know half the time

1463
05:05:59,610 --> 05:06:03,610
what the fuck they're saying he said the catacomb entrance stands to the north way

1464
05:06:03,610 --> 05:06:23,540
is there a way you can get through here no i'm gonna go up and around turn on subtitles

1465
05:06:23,540 --> 05:06:30,009
folder that's not a bad idea but that would be so irritating in its own right

1466
05:06:30,810 --> 05:06:37,479
hello among you has seen the dragon who saw it raise a village at the southern shore

1467

1498
05:15:37,860 --> 05:15:41,619
killing boars in warcraft all right there's a bad guy over there i think

all right no more fucking around kill a couple more cows and let's go that's it

1500
05:16:01,830 --> 05:16:10,810
there's certainly no worry of ambush out here rusted daggers didn't somebody say rusted

1501
05:16:10,810 --> 05:16:14,729
the daggers can actually be used like the rusty shit can be upgraded and actually works pretty

1502
05:16:14,729 --> 05:16:41,419
well seems fairly shallow it seems i'm not jumping in there you see i've fucking destroyed

1503
05:16:41,419 --> 05:16:54,009
myself last time we're going the right way rusty weapons are extremely overpowered when

1504
05:16:54,009 --> 05:16:59,700
they're upgraded fully that's kind of cool so there's a reason to use them there's a

1505
05:16:59,700 --> 05:17:15,380
chest right here throw somebody in to test it so much money no here's the entrance

1506
05:17:30,869 --> 05:17:36,360

they use them when they need to okay the voice changer is just their voice

1644
05:56:25,799 --> 05:56:33,860
there's a character creator that was a fair amount of stamina

1645
05:56:36,330 --> 05:56:44,970

05:58:41,849 --> 05:58:42,349
are they

1654
05:58:43,069 --> 05:58:44,590

1656
05:59:14,799 --> 05:59:15,299

1657
05:59:30,439 --> 05:59:32,680
what's the water pike thing called i mean the water

hold on thank you the path diverges did i cut it too quickly i think i might have

1672
06:03:12,919 --> 06:03:37,520
i think i gotta be up there i cut it too quickly i gotta go around let us check them out maybe not

1673
06:03:37,520 --> 06:03:46,270
monsters never want a character server still working for the game yeah

1674
06:03:48,029 --> 06:03:54,939
seems like it at least

1675
06:03:55,500 --> 06:04:04,650
isn't ready yourself i'm on my way i'll go at once all right going

1676
06:04:05,450 --> 06:04:11,279
oh

1677
06:04:49,639 --> 06:04:55,840
there it is there's a line he said the line everyone was waiting for that

1678
06:04:55,840 --> 06:05:15,180
but i really should try to play this game again it's quite good yeah it's just kind of fun to play

1679
06:05:16,220 --> 06:05:20,299
i mean we the first two or three hours of the stream we went over the kind of the jokey

1680
06:05:20,299 --> 06:05:28,029
shit that's in the game but as just a video game it's it's actually very fun it's a

1681
06:05:28,029 --> 06:06:03,049
straight-up video game i don't think that's safe i'm on my way there's like a stone over

1682
06:06:03,049 --> 06:06:11,240
here should i change people

1683
06:06:13,069 --> 06:06:26,700
i'll take that what level are these people 15 14 oh good that's just in case you're going

1684
06:06:26,700 --> 06:06:34,250
to change out a party member or something all right save it let's go pay the cult a visit

1685
06:06:44,959 --> 06:06:49,759
easy this looks interesting do you come to offer prayers for those who put down the crystal

1686
06:06:49,759 --> 06:07:03,159
here very well i'll go at once what's that do i only get to place that one time i'll take that

1687
06:07:03,799 --> 06:07:17,049
i need a lantern it is too dark to navigate without a torch i'll well search the area

1688
06:07:17,049 --> 06:07:27,520
the crypt was fashioned ages before the fate came to grancest oh rats light cure

1689
06:07:27,919 --> 06:07:38,590
this looks interesting you need to open this gate to use the lift long ago when the people

1690
06:07:38,590 --> 06:07:46,959
worshiped the old gods the gods of nature we cannot pass through i suspect it's why they

1691
06:07:46,959 --> 06:07:54,270
return their dead to the soil to the earth god what's this that their souls might be

1692
06:07:54,270 --> 06:08:00,840
cleansed and born anew and they never stop talking it's very very funny they don't ever

1693
06:08:00,840 --> 06:08:08,840
stop speaking

1694
06:08:08,840 --> 06:08:17,639
go the other way go this way that's interesting this place crawls with the undead i've learned

1695
06:08:17,639 --> 06:08:22,220
of this area what's this yes you have

1696
06:08:22,220 --> 06:08:30,639
a joke voice you heard it

1697
06:08:38,479 --> 06:08:40,240
well fire is really good here

1698
06:08:41,680 --> 06:08:43,520
this looks interesting what is that

1699
06:09:02,639 --> 06:09:06,240
so it would be awkward if nobody talked in a party of four people

1700
06:09:08,080 --> 06:09:16,860
yeah it would all right strength in numbers i believe some of the coffins are booby trapped

1701
06:09:18,360 --> 06:09:24,540
that's good to know check closely before opening the coffins no booby trap in there

1702
06:09:25,340 --> 06:09:30,520
this is the person here

1703
06:09:38,430 --> 06:09:46,240
we all have a curse now maybe i shouldn't have jumped inside of the casket this second you

1704
06:09:46,319 --> 06:09:47,279
fucking opened it

1705
06:09:56,220 --> 06:10:18,189
opening up all these fucked up sarcophagus i'm gonna stand in them just poop master things

1706
06:10:23,790 --> 06:10:26,590
nice move that was a knee right to the face

1707
06:10:34,939 --> 06:10:36,939
oh

1708
06:10:39,020 --> 06:10:43,279
all these uh fragments are dropping they're pretty good

1709
06:10:45,119 --> 06:10:50,400
we have triumphs if they hate fire they'll know this does not seem

1710
06:10:55,659 --> 06:10:56,880
back up

1711
06:10:56,880 --> 06:11:03,000
i'm on my way yeah it was really embarrassing

1712
06:11:11,000 --> 06:11:13,000
whack them all you ain't gonna get up

1713
06:11:13,639 --> 06:11:16,680

1716
06:11:55,639 --> 06:11:59,419
so i'm about to wrap around there is the lever back here

1717
06:12:00,220 --> 06:12:09,319
i'm gonna assume i have to go down a little bit further or okay look another lever

1718
06:12:25,549 --> 06:12:34,680
no i'm dead no i am the structure is built from a natural cavern it is half a labyrinth

1719
06:12:35,240 --> 06:12:41,720
i'll take that chest and crumbled here and there with age what's more it is a lost place

1720
06:12:43,880 --> 06:12:47,959
this the game really is so cool the fact that these are all people that i didn't make

1721
06:12:49,080 --> 06:12:54,360
is really really funny really interesting so am i gonna step on the spiders or you guys

1722
06:12:54,360 --> 06:13:03,400

06:27:28,650 --> 06:27:32,250
something or i might not have been here but thank you big marsh if you're still here

1787

1789
06:27:57,709 --> 06:28:02,250
and they're thinking that i did that i swear to god i'm gonna get rid of him that character

1790
06:28:02,250 --> 06:28:05,290
has to get thrown in the trash because people are gonna come and think that i actually made

1791
06:28:05,290 --> 06:28:12,139
that character i didn't make any of these people i made it shito that's the only one

1792
06:28:19,049 --> 06:28:27,720

this looks interesting what's this had to use two years ago

1794
06:28:40,540 --> 06:28:50,909
it's the map this is the way to go but let me just see what's down here first probably an exit

1795
06:28:52,799 --> 06:29:07,159
shortcut something way back up maybe uh-huh we draw further from their meeting place

1796
06:29:07,959 --> 06:29:30,250
there is the shortcut perfect didn't want to make youtuber jokes but chose poop master

1797
06:29:31,130 --> 06:29:41,069
yeah but wasn't that more chats doing than it was mine and i've got to be fair to myself a

1798
06:29:41,069 --> 06:29:46,270
little bit here this pretty much like a 30 chance that the character's name is going to

1799
06:29:46,270 --> 06:29:51,290
be named like poo poo dickhead or something we've seen at least three or four of them

1800
06:29:51,849 --> 06:30:11,209
the voice from beyond the door it's the meeting

1801
06:30:22,779 --> 06:30:24,380

1816
06:33:50,860 --> 06:33:55,930
the guy that i didn't make every time i say his name i have to assume maybe one or two people

1817
06:33:55,930 --> 06:34:19,150
came to the screen i didn't make that character we obviously haven't so keep at it

1818
06:34:19,950 --> 06:34:35,959

1819
06:34:35,959 --> 06:34:46,830
every day to you arisen i'd thank you to join me for a moment we have triumphed strength in

1820
06:34:46,830 --> 06:35:03,869
numbers arisen what's that why didn't you make poop master does that somebody didn't even

1821
06:35:03,869 --> 06:35:11,900
realize listen the person that made poop master didn't know that his character was

1822
06:35:11,900 --> 06:35:17,740
going to be able to be seen or used anywhere that was a dumb just easy shitty name to make

1823
06:35:17,740 --> 06:35:33,439
your character he has no idea that it's being used online how many times you guys made a

1824
06:35:33,439 --> 06:35:38,400
character name and it was like dog shit because you don't you know if you're playing a game

1825
06:35:38,400 --> 06:35:45,119
you don't have to worry about it to be sure but at least he's talkative no honor you say

1826
06:35:47,759 --> 06:35:56,569
it was just a lark all in good fun never gave over to that raw about destruction and salvation

1827
06:35:56,569 --> 06:36:05,319
never just the same it'd be trouble if we let him go free now that he's seen the two of us

1828
06:36:05,319 --> 06:36:23,240
together why you you promise no five two by the way right guys nope more like six one or like

1829
06:36:23,240 --> 06:36:32,970
five eleven i feel more familiar with this question the arisen ran counter to the tides

1830
06:36:32,970 --> 06:36:42,169
the heretic he said but i i see what reasonable sort the sword like to hear reason i get off

1831

very well you'll be well don't be a fool sir surely my gold is worth more to you than my head

1836
06:37:28,639 --> 06:37:39,880
empty stomach to do for an unarmed man i force push them was wrong to doubt it

1837
06:37:39,880 --> 06:37:43,959

1840
06:38:02,720 --> 06:38:14,830
shouldn't have thrown a firecracker in the air sound judgment this was the only way it's okay

1841
06:38:14,830 --> 06:38:21,389
he was a bad guy hey thanks even had you spared doubtless mason would not have shown such

i have to go that way i guess i gotta go straight let's kill them

1877
06:47:14,639 --> 06:47:29,040
let's do it ain't nothing

1878
06:47:38,619 --> 06:47:40,729
just two archers they're easy nothing

1879
06:47:46,040 --> 06:47:51,369
nice work all right let's get out of here

1880
06:47:51,849 --> 06:48:12,970
okay straight on the road and then take a ride he's playing a mage yeah it seems like fun

1881
06:48:13,689 --> 06:48:24,409
the capital is not without its dangers as we remain cautious why you're not using

1882
06:48:24,409 --> 06:48:30,009
auto travel be ready for anything you madman grab the eternal fairy stone from your storage

1883
06:48:30,090 --> 06:48:38,459
all right so what do we need to do in here we need to go this way noble quarter complete it

1884
06:48:44,360 --> 06:48:55,840
he doesn't know don't break his gamer immersion can't climb this i think i have to go all the

1885
06:48:55,840 --> 06:49:06,840
way around get a new skill or two yeah i think what we'll probably do is i'll probably get

1886
06:49:06,840 --> 06:49:24,330
a new skill or two yeah i think i'll probably get a new skill or two yeah i think i'll probably

1887
06:49:24,729 --> 06:49:29,720
get a new skill or two yeah i think what we'll probably do is i'm probably gonna call it up here

1888
06:49:30,810 --> 06:49:37,340
it's been just about seven hours after the bits probably about eight hours

1889
06:49:46,040 --> 06:49:53,049
end of the stream voice yeah there's so much shit to do

1890
06:50:00,650 --> 06:50:13,720
think you play more of this game i think so i think so i did the cult then the gatherings

1891
06:50:13,720 --> 06:50:19,720
of salvation did have sinister purpose it is a grave shame the elysian slipped our snare

1892
06:50:19,720 --> 06:50:25,000
we shall redouble our vigilance here to keep the city safe i fear you are as like a target

1893
06:50:25,000 --> 06:50:31,419
as grand soren though for now i leave you with my thanks that's a lot of experience

1894
06:50:32,380 --> 06:50:50,520
cool level 19 all right so here is the deal over the next few days i got a lot of shit so

1895
06:50:51,319 --> 06:50:58,400
there's a bunch of stuff that i'm gonna have there's dreamcast there's some playstation 2

1896
06:50:58,400 --> 06:51:05,639
stuff that i wanted to do there's the dark souls 3 first person mod there's so much stuff that

1897
06:51:05,639 --> 06:51:20,200
i want to do 170 dollars of amazon purchases but there's i have a lot of things to stream

1898
06:51:20,759 --> 06:51:27,630
so expect to see this game again in the next few days but we might change gears tomorrow

1899
06:51:27,709 --> 06:51:33,310
depending on what i have because i a lot of stuff is ordered and it's shipping

1900
06:51:33,950 --> 06:51:37,869
so depending on what i end up with tomorrow we might change gears a little

1901
06:51:44,759 --> 06:51:52,139
but definitely expect this game within the next couple of days and then of course the january

1902
06:51:52,139 --> 06:51:59,150
23rd stream is just going to be irl i'm not going to play a game so let me take a look

1903
06:51:59,150 --> 06:52:08,830
actually let me see a like a calendar why am i going to stop streaming like tonight

1904
06:52:10,220 --> 06:52:13,689
um just because it's probably going to be about an eight hour stream and

1905
06:52:14,939 --> 06:52:20,750
i can always feel my energy levels dropping and getting a little tired getting hungry

1906
06:52:21,389 --> 06:52:34,409
when it's less viewers than kenshi you know it's not good that's all right though that

1907
06:52:34,409 --> 06:52:49,799
doesn't bother me it's also like yeah it's also like very late there were a lot of

1908
06:52:49,799 --> 06:52:54,759
people here earlier it was like almost 4 000 people here in the first couple two or

1909
06:52:54,759 --> 06:53:01,240
three hours of the stream i also started late too so i started like an hour plus late so

1910
06:53:01,959 --> 06:53:10,009
no i don't i don't ever expect people to you know if you if you're not interested

1911
06:53:10,009 --> 06:53:15,209
that no that's fine there's still a lot of fucking people here more than like two

1912
06:53:15,209 --> 06:53:35,880
2 500 2000 that's a lot of fucking people i had a had a great time but let me look at the

1913
06:53:35,880 --> 06:53:47,680
calendar because so today is technically friday tomorrow i don't know i kind of can't this is

1914
06:53:47,680 --> 06:53:53,520
the weird kind of spot that i'm in with all the games that i have to play so a dreamcast stream

1915
06:53:54,650 --> 06:54:00,810
is really going to have to be that's going to be over at least a couple of streams

1916
06:54:01,529 --> 06:54:06,669
a game like this needs to be streamed more than once starting like dark souls 3 insane mod

1917
06:54:06,669 --> 06:54:12,330
night that's that's can't just do that one day right i have to think of how i want to

1918
06:54:12,330 --> 06:54:24,349
block this out and do this i got shen mu i have all those classic dreamcast games

1919
06:54:28,189 --> 06:54:34,669
i'll figure it out so expect tomorrow and i don't know maybe we'll just do this again tomorrow

1920
06:54:35,479 --> 06:54:41,470
maybe it's very possible but if you don't see this tomorrow then expect either the

1921
06:54:41,470 --> 06:54:50,169
dark souls 3 insane night or uh some dreamcast stuff or i also have lifeline for playstation

1922
06:54:50,169 --> 06:54:55,099
2 which is the voice activated like i don't even know what it is i know it's like a

1923
06:54:55,099 --> 06:55:09,740
voice activated adventure game and then the 23rd yeah we got there's a lot going on so

1924
06:55:10,299 --> 06:55:15,310
regardless you'll see me tomorrow we'll figure it out thanks for sticking around if you're

1925
06:55:15,310 --> 06:55:22,810
leaving we're gonna do the bits and the subs see ya thanks for watching see y'all tomorrow

1926
06:55:22,810 --> 06:55:29,680
what's the usual time to stream i you okay i think that i no thank god i just clicked

1927
06:55:29,680 --> 06:55:35,069
i think i just shot that guy but i didn't all right we're gonna save it i usually start

1928
06:55:35,069 --> 06:55:51,479
around 3 p.m pacific which is 6 p.m eastern let me just exit the game because it's kind

1929
06:55:51,479 --> 06:56:10,520
of i can't really alt tab out of it there we go quit the game 7 a.m for aussies i can't

1930
06:56:10,520 --> 06:56:16,490
that's so strange to think about that think about where that is it's a 14 hour difference

1931
06:56:16,490 --> 06:56:32,669
isn't it no more than that 17 hour difference that's wild but let's go through the bits

1932
06:56:33,470 --> 06:56:42,400
see y'all tomorrow hopefully this time starting at three not like four pacific hey jess thanks

1933
06:56:42,400 --> 06:56:51,130
for the one dollar give shito the autotune voice modulator and actually that's not a bad idea

1934
06:56:52,409 --> 06:56:56,090
i gotta set that up though i have to change what my input is and everything it's gonna take a

1935
06:56:56,090 --> 06:57:01,610
few minutes so we'll do that another time because uh i don't have access to that changer right

1936
06:57:01,610 --> 06:57:07,919
now i have i probably have to like restart some stuff but it's a good idea like you

1937
06:57:07,919 --> 06:57:14,000
alex for the one dollar germa when are your shirts coming out i'm dying well let me i'll

1938
06:57:14,000 --> 06:57:23,159
explain the t-shirt thing so while back uh ashley and i were like hey let's do another shirt

1939
06:57:23,880 --> 06:57:29,259
and the shirt is if you don't know it is the solar system it's a beautiful picture of the of

1940
06:57:29,259 --> 06:57:35,500
the actual solar system there's some really nice nuanced stuff there's a a boy and a

1941
06:57:35,500 --> 06:57:39,500
man and his son you know looking through a telescope at the actual night sky it's a beautiful

1942
06:57:39,500 --> 06:57:47,520
shirt a couple months went by and another emote was added which was a different planet

1943
06:57:48,779 --> 06:57:52,459
i probably should put that on too another month went by oh wait hold on

1944
06:57:53,659 --> 06:57:58,349
we got like two more planet emotes so eventually it got to a point where

1945
06:57:58,349 --> 06:58:07,759
this shirt kept on getting pushed because we just i kept adding planet emotes so

1946
06:58:08,560 --> 06:58:16,860
to save the space on the shirt there are a couple of planet omissions just because it all

1947
06:58:16,860 --> 06:58:24,669
wouldn't fit on the shirt well for instance germa saturn doesn't exist it's not there

1948
06:58:24,669 --> 06:58:28,080
the planet doesn't that planet's gonna get like deleted in the next germa rumble anyways

1949
06:58:28,799 --> 06:58:43,979
germa mercury is also not on there cluedo is on there the only ones that aren't on there

1950
06:58:44,939 --> 06:58:59,279
are saturn mercury and i think that's the only two that are on there jupiter is on there oh of

1951
06:58:59,279 --> 06:59:13,759
course it is yeah you gotta have jupiter on there but it'll be it's a nice shirt it's really

1952
06:59:13,759 --> 06:59:22,330
really interesting it's really fun and it is going to be on sale very soon because i

1953
06:59:22,330 --> 06:59:30,939
literally just talked to her again and we're gonna go from there so expect it within i would

1954
06:59:31,659 --> 06:59:38,200
at some point before the end of january so either the last week of january or the first

1955
06:59:38,200 --> 06:59:42,520
week of february is probably when it'll be on sale and the glue man shirts coming back too

1956
06:59:43,400 --> 06:59:53,520
so they'll both be on sale because there's really no other reason why that would be held

1957
06:59:53,520 --> 06:59:58,110
back at all because there the shirt is pretty much done and the glue man shirt already is

1958
06:59:58,110 --> 07:00:07,759
done it's the same artwork it's just going back on sale but hopefully that answers your

1959
07:00:07,759 --> 07:00:12,119
question thank you for the one dollar thank you bake me home for the $1 thank you divas

1960
07:00:12,119 --> 07:00:19,680
for the $2 thank you mr. dask for the five dollars their masterworks all you can't go wrong

1961
07:00:22,720 --> 07:00:27,439
oh oh the masterwords all you can't go wrong where i where have i i keep hearing

1962
07:00:27,439 --> 07:00:39,849
that where have i heard that before the master works all you can't go wrong master works all

1963
07:00:39,849 --> 07:00:52,990
you can't go wrong no wait no and i think did i forget already forget it's from the game no i

1964
07:00:52,990 --> 07:01:00,669
know but what is a star sub sound okay that's probably why that's definitely where i know it

1965
07:01:00,669 --> 07:01:22,639
from then why that has a sub sound but then again what the fuck is my sub sound mine's worse

1966
07:01:22,639 --> 07:01:29,450
mine's way worse i gotta change those i gotta you know i might just drop the sub sound like

1967
07:01:29,529 --> 07:01:37,419
sound off completely or do it something else i never know what the hell to do place it with

1968
07:01:37,419 --> 07:01:45,549
something else don't do that we'll see superintendent chalmers thanks for the one dollar i can't believe

1969
07:01:45,549 --> 07:01:56,759
they made a game about the dogma from monster hunter the dodo the dogma i played monster hunter

1970
07:01:56,759 --> 07:02:03,770
what what's the dogma hey c4g thanks for the dollar 25 here you go sonny use this dollar in

1971
07:02:03,770 --> 07:02:15,979
a shiny quarter to buy yourself a brand new dreamcast new dream caster the dreamcast was

1972
07:02:15,979 --> 07:02:23,150
not expensive it's all these rare dreamcast games that are like a hundred plus dollars each

1973
07:02:23,869 --> 07:02:30,680
i severely underestimated just how rare some of this stuff actually was

1974
07:02:31,560 --> 07:02:37,360
uh thank you sad vega for the one dollar hey germa i know you won't see this till after the

1975
07:02:37,360 --> 07:02:42,479
stream but there are some great mods for this game that improve the graphics and look at the

1976
07:02:42,479 --> 07:02:48,080
game without changing its mechanics unless you want to change mechanics go check out nexus mods

1977
07:02:48,080 --> 07:02:54,139
and don't get the blind me mod and i'll get the don't blind me mod really helpful with

1978
07:02:54,139 --> 07:03:00,540
lightning effects i was actually going to say that i was thinking that but i didn't say it

1979
07:03:01,580 --> 07:03:11,180
that every time the lightning struck it was kind of unnerving to my brain i will at least

1980
07:03:11,180 --> 07:03:20,459
go get that one uh and also the resident enb grandsis texture improvement there's also a handy

1981
07:03:20,459 --> 07:03:25,720
dandy mod pack that i think is most popular that improves most things i'll probably just

1982
07:03:25,720 --> 07:03:34,569
go get it especially the lightning stuff and some of the other maybe graphic updates but

1983
07:03:34,569 --> 07:03:37,689
i thank you i appreciate that because i the lightning thing is something i was thinking

1984
07:03:37,689 --> 07:03:43,560
but wasn't saying hey dan with wings thanks for the 10 dollars dan hey germa i haven't been

1985
07:03:43,560 --> 07:03:46,759
able to resub for the last couple of months since i wasn't working due to school

1986
07:03:47,319 --> 07:03:50,840
figured out give back by giving some community subs and bits from my favorite streamer

1987
07:03:51,560 --> 07:03:58,330
also you introduced me to celeste with which i am enjoying a lot that's not surprising celeste

1988
07:03:58,330 --> 07:04:04,919
was a really really really great fun challenging platformer no surprise that you're enjoying it

1989
07:04:07,819 --> 07:04:13,259
but thank you for your community subs and thank you for the 10 dollars no one is ever

1990
07:04:13,259 --> 07:04:19,630
under any obligation to pay me please keep that in mind but thank you so much regardless

1991
07:04:22,700 --> 07:04:34,319
online influencer i have one guy bought it how many people bought celeste after the two celeste

1992
07:04:34,319 --> 07:04:43,450
streams that's not a great return on investment if i was a game company what are like 11 people

1993
07:04:43,450 --> 07:05:00,459
buy it okay imagine if like imagine if even 100 people downloaded celeste celeste is how much

1994
07:05:00,459 --> 07:05:12,240
money 20 bucks so if it's 20 dollars so that would be like what 100 copies would be a

1995
07:05:12,240 --> 07:05:21,659
two grand right so imagine if i had been like paid i'm not saying i'm not just that i'm not

1996
07:05:21,659 --> 07:05:25,979
saying i was well this is the exact amount of money i would get but imagine if i was paid to

1997
07:05:25,979 --> 07:05:36,939
like promote that game and only like 80 people bought it well they would have made money but

1998
07:05:36,939 --> 07:05:45,159
would they have though because they would have had to pay me right true but at least you

1999
07:05:45,159 --> 07:05:52,889
still get paid but those 80 people convinced two other people to buy it so then you got

2000
07:05:52,970 --> 07:05:57,529
80 people telling two people then two people telling 80 and then 80 more people than all the

2001
07:05:57,529 --> 07:06:07,689
sudden that's that's 200 000 sales over the course of like six months how much do you charge

2002
07:06:07,689 --> 07:06:19,119
per stream i've never done it so i don't know i have no idea probably like 30 probably 30

2003
07:06:19,119 --> 07:06:27,290
bucks no no it would have to be it'd have to be like you know what it would be like

2004
07:06:27,290 --> 07:06:35,799
it would be a uh it'd be a thousand dollars per person watching well that would be way too

2005
07:06:35,799 --> 07:06:42,569
much maybe what would it be about per viewer 100 bucks per viewer because you know that's how

2006
07:06:42,569 --> 07:06:47,529
valuable these viewers are these aren't just some simple run-of-the-mill fucking viewers

2007
07:06:47,529 --> 07:06:54,029
okay i could sell you guys so hard you know i know i could talk about how you guys are some

2008
07:06:54,029 --> 07:06:58,830
of the most valuable viewers on twitch and it would be i'll be telling the truth but that

2009
07:06:58,830 --> 07:07:11,680
marketing person would hear that i'm only worth 100 bucks that's pretty cheap well 100 times

2010
07:07:11,680 --> 07:07:22,779
1600 is that's a lot that would mean 1600 that's oh my god that's too that's way too much money

2011
07:07:23,500 --> 07:07:36,220
that's 160 000 okay you know what i'll stream i will stream fallout 5 but i want 160 000

2012
07:07:36,220 --> 07:07:43,680
dollars and that's that 1600 people there were 35 3800 people here earlier that's almost a

2013
07:07:43,680 --> 07:08:00,380
half million dollars to stream it no i don't do sponsored streams so i never have and

2014
07:08:00,380 --> 07:08:13,900
i don't think i ever will you mean you you mean your audience is the easiest to manipulate

2015
07:08:14,619 --> 07:08:22,909
what fairway solitaire doesn't count because that was like on youtube like six years ago

2016
07:08:22,909 --> 07:08:26,990
it's the only time i've ever done it i've never done it ever since and that was i

2017
07:08:26,990 --> 07:08:32,029
already made a video listen to me hold on a minute let me defend myself i made a fairway

2018
07:08:32,029 --> 07:08:39,470
solitaire video because i liked the game a lot the company then contacted me and said hey you

2019
07:08:39,470 --> 07:08:43,630
want to give the game away to a bunch of people and i was like sure i think the game's fun it

2020
07:08:43,630 --> 07:08:50,159
was later it was after that and it was just you could just download the game for free if you

2021
07:08:50,159 --> 07:08:53,770
used a code i think you know if i had to pay for anything i was like hold on it was just

2022
07:08:53,770 --> 07:08:58,250
it's just gonna be free like no questions asked the game's free they're like yes if

2023
07:08:58,250 --> 07:09:02,810
they use your code okay that's it the game is just for free it was like a two dollar

2024
07:09:02,810 --> 07:09:22,139
game at the time and now the game is just free years later you sounded defensive no i don't i

2025
07:09:22,139 --> 07:09:30,880
don't do sponsored streams because i don't like the dynamic i don't i don't it doesn't sit well

2026
07:09:30,880 --> 07:09:37,080
with me for a few reasons because of nothing against it if people want to make some extra

2027
07:09:37,080 --> 07:09:43,340
money you know that's fine if it's relevant to what they're doing that's fine but i just i

2028
07:09:43,419 --> 07:09:50,959
just don't like it like why in the name of god would i ever play like some free to play card

2029
07:09:50,959 --> 07:09:54,799
game for like an hour and a half like why would that ever happen you know i would never

2030
07:09:54,799 --> 07:10:13,400
do that what if it's a game you enjoy yeah that's fine but that's not typically how it

2031
07:10:13,400 --> 07:10:22,279
works from my uh last five plus years doing things on the internet it's always like the

2032
07:10:22,279 --> 07:10:27,639
game that nobody actually really wants to play will give you a shitload of money if you play it

2033
07:10:28,279 --> 07:10:34,110
i don't want to do that it's not like i mean sure there are people that have you know sponsored

2034
07:10:34,110 --> 07:10:38,990
streams from companies they know like ubisoft and i mean i've that might not even be real

2035
07:10:38,990 --> 07:10:45,229
but i know that there are large companies that do them but a lot of them are games that

2036
07:10:45,229 --> 07:10:49,549
people might not even really necessarily care about in the first place at least that's how it

2037
07:10:49,549 --> 07:11:04,159
was like on youtube if the makers of 700,000 games offered you 10 grand to play volume 3 would

2038
07:11:04,159 --> 07:11:11,020
you take the money no i'd be like i'll pay for it but the game well actually you know what how

2039
07:11:11,020 --> 07:11:17,310
about this sure i'll do that every single one of those games has to open though and if the

2040
07:11:17,310 --> 07:11:28,569
games if one game on that list doesn't open i get triple the money for each one that doesn't

2041
07:11:28,569 --> 07:11:40,159
open that'll light the fire under the a** to make sure that they work sounds like a good

2042
07:11:40,159 --> 07:12:00,939
deal we've got some shito fan art oh that's really cute it's like everybody loves shito

2043
07:12:01,819 --> 07:12:09,020
if a game developer sent you a game copy or review copy would you take it no and here's the

2044
07:12:09,020 --> 07:12:14,139
reason why here are the reasons why i don't do sponsored streams i don't like to take

2045
07:12:14,139 --> 07:12:21,819
free games or press games press copies because i think about it differently if i get a copy of

2046
07:12:21,819 --> 07:12:27,659
a game for free or if i get a sponsored game it will change the way that i talk it'll change

2047
07:12:27,659 --> 07:12:32,459
the way that i do things because i know that this was given to me or this was sponsored and

2048
07:12:32,459 --> 07:12:40,270
i have it just is in the back of my mind me paying for a game or me just buying it and

2049
07:12:40,270 --> 07:12:46,040
doing whatever i want with it i am at my own free will to do whatever i want if i were

2050
07:12:46,040 --> 07:12:51,400
to take a game for free and then say a bunch of shit about it it'd be like okay well

2051
07:12:51,720 --> 07:13:02,990
like hey wait wait why are you doing that i would rather not hinder anything that i ever

2052
07:13:02,990 --> 07:13:09,659
wanted to say or do because i know a lot of sponsored streams they say hey you can kind

2053
07:13:09,659 --> 07:13:14,939
of say what you want but don't do anything don't be so bad oh you know i don't know i would be

2054
07:13:14,939 --> 07:13:18,540
afraid that somebody would rip my fucking contract in half because i'd come across like

2055
07:13:18,540 --> 07:13:21,659
a bug that i didn't like and i'd be like fuck this game and all of a sudden it was like

2056
07:13:22,220 --> 07:13:37,919
the piano fucking falls from the ceiling it's like if you get a christmas present you have

2057
07:13:37,919 --> 07:13:44,279
to pretend to like it yeah but i'm not even sure the the answer is pretending to like it it's just

2058
07:13:44,279 --> 07:13:51,689
knowing that it was given to you for a reason there's pretending to like it and then there's

2059
07:13:51,689 --> 07:14:03,799
knowing that you were given this thing for a very specific reason it's also difficult to

2060
07:14:03,799 --> 07:14:09,689
judge something fairly if you didn't yeah but i mean for journalistic journalistic approach

2061
07:14:10,490 --> 07:14:13,869
right like if you were like a journalistic outlet if you're like a game reviewer

2062
07:14:14,509 --> 07:14:20,669
or it i don't think there's that this maybe there's not something actually wrong with it

2063
07:14:21,470 --> 07:14:31,919
if your company is based around doing full-on like breakdowns of games maybe it is maybe that

2064
07:14:31,919 --> 07:14:43,240
goes against it completely feel free to say whatever you want as long as it's not negative

2065
07:14:43,240 --> 07:14:48,880
or discourages people from buying the product i just can't have that living over my head even

2066
07:14:48,880 --> 07:14:56,540
if i like it some people are better with that dealing with promotions you're just not one of

2067
07:14:56,540 --> 07:15:01,680
them yeah and i don't have it look there's i don't have anything wrong with it there's nothing in

2068
07:15:01,680 --> 07:15:11,959
my brain that says that's wrong what you're doing but also keep this in mind too at the

2069
07:15:11,959 --> 07:15:19,950
end of the day you guys are watching a stream and what you see on the stream is what you

2070
07:15:20,750 --> 07:15:27,630
in your in your mind it's something that i have decided that i wanted to show you right

2071
07:15:28,349 --> 07:15:34,750
and if i tell you with this three or four thousand people here hey check this out isn't

2072
07:15:34,750 --> 07:15:40,889
that really cool check it out i don't want to be disingenuous of the things that i'm showing you

2073
07:15:41,610 --> 07:15:53,400
because there's a lot of people that come to streams and they oh i want to what what are you

2074
07:15:53,400 --> 07:16:01,080
doing today oh it's something that you necessarily didn't decide to do you decided to do it but

2075
07:16:01,080 --> 07:16:06,970
for a different reason not because you wanted to show your audience something because maybe

2076
07:16:07,049 --> 07:16:12,650
you were offered money to from a company to show it not necessarily you wanting to do it

2077
07:16:13,369 --> 07:16:22,590
and it's nothing to do with honesty it really did i it i did say i used the word disingenuous

2078
07:16:25,000 --> 07:16:30,139
but if i let's just put this way if i got fucking 10 grand to play a shitty mobile game

2079
07:16:30,139 --> 07:16:34,299
on stream and pretend i was having fun some of you guys would download it and you'd be

2080
07:16:34,299 --> 07:16:40,459
like this game sucked this was stupid why did he do that oh he did he took a bunch of money

2081
07:16:40,459 --> 07:16:54,860
okay i guess right like they would that's the reason i think it's nice that you want to show

2082
07:16:54,860 --> 07:17:05,229
us something that you'd really enjoy or at least try to enjoy i mean that's from my view that's

2083
07:17:05,229 --> 07:17:11,869
what i want to do here and the money coming in people talking about money and making money and

2084
07:17:12,669 --> 07:17:24,650
there's a shitload of money comes in already a lot so i mean could i make more money could

2085
07:17:24,650 --> 07:17:29,610
i make way more money i don't maybe if i took a bunch of sponsored streams and deals but i

2086
07:17:29,610 --> 07:17:41,790
don't like i don't have to do that i don't like need to do that and if i can just kind of do my

2087
07:17:41,790 --> 07:17:47,150
thing and not have to worry about taking it like sponsor deals or but that lies down obviously

2088
07:17:48,590 --> 07:17:52,349
the reason why i'm able to do that is because so many people do sub to the stream and do

2089
07:17:52,349 --> 07:17:57,159
give money so i don't like i don't have to go get like oh i'm gonna get i want to get

2090
07:17:57,159 --> 07:18:06,110
like a ten thousand dollar sponsorship it's not it's not really that necessary because

2091
07:18:06,110 --> 07:18:09,630
like you guys already you guys already do that you already give a shitload of money

2092
07:18:10,270 --> 07:18:19,500
there's maybe a weird question but how do you handle such a large amount of donations tax wise

2093
07:18:21,840 --> 07:18:27,919
uh it's i mean it's just it's classified as you know like income like tips it's just money

2094
07:18:30,509 --> 07:18:36,970
goes through twitch even with paypal it's still classified as tips right and you have to

2095
07:18:37,610 --> 07:18:53,959
pay taxes on tips stop having integrity but i but i don't want to come off as like the

2096
07:18:54,680 --> 07:19:02,889
i'm the last bastion of integrity on the platform no there are plenty of ways to

2097
07:19:03,529 --> 07:19:12,299
run a live stream and there are plenty of other people that don't do like sponsors

2098
07:19:13,020 --> 07:19:23,950
there are a lot of them i'm not the only one and like i've said 10 minutes ago i don't i don't

2099
07:19:23,950 --> 07:19:48,520
have a negative attitude towards somebody that does classified actually means he doesn't do his

2100
07:19:48,520 --> 07:20:00,889
taxes wait what i have i have i i'm about to do them in like i'm about to file my return

2101
07:20:00,889 --> 07:20:10,330
probably in a week or two so and i got a actually have i have a very very good cpa

2102
07:20:11,500 --> 07:20:24,639
very trustworthy evading you know just jerma ignore this message i can't you have the one

2103
07:20:24,639 --> 07:20:36,540
guy emailed there teach us how to do taxes it's uh all right you want to know how to do

2104
07:20:36,540 --> 07:20:43,979
your taxes dip yourself in fucking like just get just buy like a giant fryer later

2105
07:20:44,939 --> 07:20:56,880
and then dip yourself in it on max heat that's what it's like buy the tune liquid from

2106
07:20:56,880 --> 07:21:20,189
who framed roger rabbit and just slowly sit in it sounds about right just eat the paper

2107
07:21:20,830 --> 07:21:35,790
but it won't work we aren't tunes um what what you're on a tune stream right now

2108
07:21:35,790 --> 07:21:47,529
hey how do you feel about urinals let me tell you something all right let's move on now spend a

2109
07:21:47,529 --> 07:21:56,139
lot of time talking about that but it's nice to discuss it every now and again because there

2110
07:21:56,139 --> 07:22:03,560
there are pros and cons to all these things you know like think about that to put one

2111
07:22:03,560 --> 07:22:09,479
last point into that conversation imagine if i did a couple of sponsor streams and then all

2112
07:22:09,479 --> 07:22:14,919
the sudden that pays for jerma rumble too you know what i mean like there there are

2113
07:22:14,919 --> 07:22:23,639
pros and cons but the cons for me have always out kind of grown i mean the cons the cons have

2114
07:22:23,639 --> 07:22:29,840
outgrown the pros for me pretty much every time i think about it i've thought about it a lot

2115
07:22:31,639 --> 07:22:34,520
this ain't something that i've just kind of hey let's talk about this now

2116
07:22:35,240 --> 07:22:45,959
i internalize this all the time but thank you dan with wings that was where we left off

2117
07:22:46,680 --> 07:22:50,680
uh drum age thank you drum edge for the one dollar hey you probably don't even remember

2118
07:22:50,680 --> 07:22:59,740
the cheer about lisa uh and begging for it but still want to apologize for it it was wasted

2119
07:23:01,040 --> 07:23:10,060
as fuck like right now no don't worry about it don't worry about that it's all right you've

2120
07:23:10,060 --> 07:23:14,139
recommended a game to me oh no i think i know what you're talking about when i brought up

2121
07:23:15,099 --> 07:23:19,819
moving to another game and i just used the word lisa i think that's because you were the

2122
07:23:19,819 --> 07:23:24,700
last message that i saw about a game recommendation and that was just the last

2123
07:23:24,700 --> 07:23:30,159
game recommendation that i saw there's nothing to do with what you said or how you said it or

2124
07:23:30,159 --> 07:23:39,200
something no you you you you were the one guy and that's how that happened people have been

2125
07:23:39,200 --> 07:23:45,819
asking for lisa a trillion times i suggested a year ago yeah but okay every time somebody

2126
07:23:45,819 --> 07:23:54,159
suggests lisa they are sandwiched by two people saying don't play lisa you know there's like

2127
07:23:54,159 --> 07:24:11,979
a i just like burped really loud and then hopefully the music covered it if anyone

2128
07:24:11,979 --> 07:24:21,240
doesn't want lisa play it now it's a good ass game series but i feel like it's not for you

2129
07:24:24,299 --> 07:24:33,080
maybe i don't know you should not play lisa it's too sad to make it a fun stream that's kind of

2130
07:24:33,080 --> 07:24:38,590
what i hear that it's a great game but streaming it is like it's a sad game

2131
07:24:39,389 --> 07:24:44,189
and it wouldn't be like a fun stream it would be like a sad stream is that accurate

2132
07:24:45,229 --> 07:25:02,720
you'd have to take it seriously we'll see i'll put it on the list i don't know

2133
07:25:03,360 --> 07:25:08,729
that's tough because i want to be like sad on stream i don't want to be sad in general either

2134
07:25:10,159 --> 07:25:14,639
but thank you uh drummage for the one dollar two dollars here could you check out age of empires

2135
07:25:14,639 --> 07:25:20,240
too for lulls sometime if not could you at least give your thoughts on it if i even know

2136
07:25:20,240 --> 07:25:25,279
what it is it's one of the original real time strategy games that predated everything else

2137
07:25:25,279 --> 07:25:33,000
i know what it is i watched a guy play that on a plane when i was like 14 i was sitting

2138
07:25:33,080 --> 07:25:38,680
in the aisle seat and he was one row above and in the aisle seat to the right so he was

2139
07:25:38,680 --> 07:25:45,720
diagonal to me and he had a laptop on the plane i had to have been like 14 or 15 at the time

2140
07:25:45,720 --> 07:25:51,720
he was older he was probably in his like mid to late 30s and i was just sitting there

2141
07:25:51,720 --> 07:25:56,349
watching him play and eventually he like noticed i was watching because i was just

2142
07:25:56,349 --> 07:26:03,709
staring at a screen and i said what is that and he said this is uh age of uh age of kings

2143
07:26:05,580 --> 07:26:14,319
it's age of age of empires too is age of kings right age of kings yeah i got it

2144
07:26:14,319 --> 07:26:26,319
age of empires too age of kings and i remember going oh this is great watch he was the game's

2145
07:26:26,319 --> 07:26:40,750
lead developer i just caught this right here in the chat here uh roshimi uh swift recently

2146
07:26:40,750 --> 07:26:45,470
diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis any good recipes or any lifestyle changes i should try

2147
07:26:46,189 --> 07:26:56,240
i understand you've had issues and i just wanted your input yeah i i don't know what your uh

2148
07:26:56,240 --> 07:27:00,159
plan is for your doctor i don't know what your what they're going to try first because

2149
07:27:00,159 --> 07:27:07,630
there are a couple of different options for treatment but lifestyle wise at least initially

2150
07:27:07,630 --> 07:27:14,650
you have to kind of start ruling out stuff that you can't really eat for a while i

2151
07:27:14,650 --> 07:27:19,290
couldn't drink even i don't know i'm not sure how old you are but i couldn't drink a sip of alcohol

2152
07:27:20,330 --> 07:27:27,770
if i even drank like one beer or like one cocktail it would be living hell the next like

2153
07:27:27,770 --> 07:27:37,000
three or four days so for some people have their own internal uh issues and some foods

2154
07:27:37,000 --> 07:27:44,299
affect people differently especially if you have colitis i've since got into a pretty good

2155
07:27:45,259 --> 07:27:53,770
run here where i haven't had any really major problems i still do have problems but you know

2156
07:27:53,770 --> 07:27:59,950
i won't really discuss them on stream because they're kind of uh very disgusting and very

2157
07:27:59,950 --> 07:28:14,319
not i don't i don't i don't think i'd want to share the that stuff on stream but uh wait hold

2158
07:28:14,319 --> 07:28:19,099
on i'll touch on that in a second somebody just said about me being a kid in 1999

2159
07:28:20,060 --> 07:28:29,180
you would have been a teenager i was like i said 14 or 15 right 2009 2019 that was 20 years ago

2160
07:28:29,979 --> 07:28:39,000
so i'm 33 23 30 i was like that's 13 and i said 14 what are you talking about your math is off

2161
07:28:39,000 --> 07:28:52,400
my math is correct but uh you really need to just kind of look at your diet you start to rule

2162
07:28:52,400 --> 07:29:02,669
out fried stuff fatty stuff and some people can eat whatever they want and make sure you

2163
07:29:02,669 --> 07:29:12,299
get a good doctor that's going to give you a good treatment plan ask about it's a very

2164
07:29:12,299 --> 07:29:19,259
expensive drug unfortunately for some dumb fucking reason but one of the things because

2165
07:29:19,259 --> 07:29:27,020
i had mine started to localize itself i don't know where yours is but the drug is

2166
07:29:27,020 --> 07:29:34,299
is kanasa is the drug and it helped me a lot because mine was a little bit lower

2167
07:29:35,099 --> 07:29:45,020
i'm not going to give you any recommendations for what you should take for drugs

2168
07:29:45,659 --> 07:29:53,759
but i had a lot of issues that eventually after a couple of endoscopies the doctors were like

2169
07:29:53,759 --> 07:30:06,119
you know it's localized a little bit lower so we're going to put you on this it's a

2170
07:30:06,680 --> 07:30:13,419
met meslamine meslamine it's like an aspirin kind of uh derivative

2171
07:30:14,060 --> 07:30:19,159
scheduled for a colonoscopy in a couple weeks but i was hospitalized for a good week due to

2172
07:30:19,159 --> 07:30:25,799
pain that's why i started seeing a gi specialist will definitely continue to see that specialist

2173
07:30:26,520 --> 07:30:34,000
because you might get a little discouraged and not care and not want to do it oh i

2174
07:30:34,000 --> 07:30:37,439
got to go in and get it scoped i got to get scoped i got what do i try this

2175
07:30:38,400 --> 07:30:43,599
it's really easy to like kind of just fall down into like a depression and not give a fuck anymore

2176
07:30:43,599 --> 07:30:51,880
but keep going make sure that you get that doctor you on the right page then try to take

2177
07:30:51,880 --> 07:30:59,849
care of yourself and get yourself into remission it's a huge pain but i feel pretty good right

2178
07:30:59,849 --> 07:31:19,450
now and i did not 10 years ago not at all so i can relate for real i wish you the best i

2179
07:31:19,450 --> 07:31:28,799
wish you the best of luck hopefully you and your doctor can figure out a good plan i thought

2180
07:31:28,799 --> 07:31:36,919
i was lactose intolerant at first yeah when i first started having problems it was i went

2181
07:31:36,919 --> 07:31:41,740
through i mean i'm not going to be disgusting or anything but there was a bunch of weird

2182
07:31:41,740 --> 07:31:48,880
shit that i did that the doctor was checking for it took it took it was after i got

2183
07:31:48,880 --> 07:31:53,119
scoped for the first time that really it was okay i think this is what you have

2184
07:31:54,000 --> 07:31:59,400
and from there i got put on a couple of drugs that i really didn't like

2185
07:32:00,119 --> 07:32:11,450
and it's kind of sucks that i was on them for a while i don't even know if they still prescribe

2186
07:32:11,450 --> 07:32:25,549
it which is kind of terrifying in its own right i mean i wonder if this medicine even still

2187
07:32:25,549 --> 07:32:46,409
exists yeah it does yeah i was on imuran for a long time and i really didn't like it

2188
07:32:47,979 --> 07:32:52,139
but it may have been one of the reasons why i went into remission i don't know

2189
07:32:52,139 --> 07:33:00,250
but i fucking hated that drug i hated being on that drug because there's a lot of weird

2190
07:33:01,130 --> 07:33:27,529
issues with it imagine jerma as a celebrity i don't think i want to imagine that they

2191
07:33:27,529 --> 07:33:33,740
definitely still prescribe imuran i was on it until last year so that yes they do i don't know

2192
07:33:33,740 --> 07:33:38,729
if they still did it because there's a there's a lot of literature that i can really help it's

2193
07:33:38,729 --> 07:33:43,849
an immunomodulator they prescribe it to people that do like kidney transplant it's like a

2194
07:33:43,849 --> 07:33:50,430
transplant acceptor drug but it does have some weird effects on crones and colitis

2195
07:33:51,389 --> 07:33:58,840
and ibd symptoms so it just weird that just freaked me out taking it like an immunomodulator

2196
07:33:58,840 --> 07:34:10,990
like if it's fucking with my dna but anyways i wish you the best of luck take care of yourself

2197
07:34:10,990 --> 07:34:20,040
listen to your doctor and get a good plan but anyways uh age of empire age of kings

2198
07:34:20,040 --> 07:34:30,830
i'm aware of it and i think it was cool dub ski dude thanks for the one dollar dragons dog

2199
07:34:30,990 --> 07:34:35,790
is a special game to me the most legendary gaming fail of my entire life happened in this game

2200
07:34:36,750 --> 07:34:44,509
i was soloing the ur dragon it's a secret boss with like 20 health bars and it literally took

2201
07:34:44,509 --> 07:34:51,720
six hours for me to beat when i finally killed it it hit me with petrified i desperately tried

2202
07:34:51,720 --> 07:34:56,599
to loot the corpse but turned to stone and died before i could grab anything and i lost

2203
07:34:56,599 --> 07:35:15,549
the loot forever i literally wanted to eat my own head that sucks six hours that is rough

2204
07:35:15,549 --> 07:35:21,849
that's very rough and that's the kind of stuff i can look forward to then bring it on sounds

2205
07:35:21,849 --> 07:35:27,259
fun thank you dork cube for the one dollar this game looks beautiful and ugly at the same time

2206
07:35:27,259 --> 07:35:32,680
it's because i don't have the mods to make it look better that was my fault mind my halo

2207
07:35:33,869 --> 07:35:37,470
thank you for the ten dollars smelly boy thank you for the one dollar

2208
07:35:38,029 --> 07:35:58,919

for the three bucks they say it had to be done i can't tell is did you what is

2211
07:36:25,500 --> 07:36:32,299
this an image of my eyes on that character is this the willem defoe face i don't know it's

2212
07:36:32,299 --> 07:36:36,279
freaking me out i can't look at that for more than five seconds don't look at that picture

2213
07:36:36,279 --> 07:36:42,669
before you sleep it'll that that monster will come out of your mirror or something

2214
07:36:44,090 --> 07:36:48,569
hey smelly boy thanks for the one dollar who's your favorite animator on new grounds

2215
07:36:50,169 --> 07:36:56,439
blow it out really hey mostly lost thanks for the one dollar your resistance and

2216
07:36:56,439 --> 07:37:01,159
hesitation to use any stupid jokey characters is even funnier than the characters themselves

2217
07:37:01,639 --> 07:37:08,970
especially since we all know you'll give in eventually well i did i played with two

2218
07:37:08,970 --> 07:37:19,419
characters that had poop in their name there was poop but and then like poop master so it

2219
07:37:19,419 --> 07:37:25,419
happened i told you 30 percent of the characters have that word or a variant of that in their

2220
07:37:25,419 --> 07:37:32,110
name you're not going to be able to do a full playthrough of this game and not have

2221
07:37:32,110 --> 07:37:36,990
one character in your party whose name is like poopoo dick it's not going to happen it's

2222
07:37:36,990 --> 07:37:39,310
going to happen because you're going to have the right spells and abilities that you're going

2223
07:37:39,310 --> 07:37:43,799
to need and you're going to want to bring them in just for like a couple minutes to do one mission

2224
07:37:52,319 --> 07:37:56,400
i can't believe somebody gave me all the end game items like what the hell that i'm actually

2225
07:37:56,400 --> 07:38:00,959
like kind of sad i just realized that i did that just image just popped up in my brain

2226
07:38:00,959 --> 07:38:11,470
right now thank you carrot seven for the one dollar i fell asleep during your character

2227
07:38:11,470 --> 07:38:17,709
creation woke up to a brave soul named poop butt being eaten by a hydra i like this game

2228
07:38:20,799 --> 07:38:34,619
that was so fucking funny and the fact that a bunch of people said that they've never seen

2229
07:38:34,619 --> 07:38:40,240
that cut scene before because i took too long to fight the tutorial boss but that was because

2230
07:38:40,240 --> 07:38:46,240
i was laughing and couldn't do anything i was watching a guy named poop but get fucking

2231
07:38:46,240 --> 07:38:51,880
digested by a snake what was i supposed to do how are you supposed to react to that

2232
07:38:52,599 --> 07:39:10,959
there's no way you can react to that any differently oh god that was fucking funny that

2233
07:39:10,959 --> 07:39:20,299
took so much energy out of me though i was laughing so hard it took it so long to go through

2234
07:39:21,470 --> 07:39:25,709
he started in the top of the mouth and i didn't i never got him out you just slowly see

2286
07:47:16,029 --> 07:47:19,630

2299
07:48:59,630 --> 07:49:04,590
c's and s's or multiple r's and e's and m's that's when i have the most problems succession

2305
07:49:46,830 --> 07:50:06,520
that is a very hard question uh general grievous no no no no no no no no no no

2306
07:50:07,159 --> 07:50:27,279
not ben 10 he doesn't ben 10 doesn't count i really hate to be like a bandwagon shithead here

2307
07:50:27,919 --> 07:50:32,779
i hate it but i hate to say this everyone's gonna be like of course you're gonna say that

2308
07:50:32,779 --> 07:50:40,700
because the last move thanos i know i know it's like okay yeah bro you like that because

2309
07:50:40,700 --> 07:50:52,799
of the last movie that came out probably thanos is a villain well they said they said who is

2310
07:50:52,799 --> 07:50:59,200
your favorite super person nightwing aquaman green goblin they put a villain in the question

2311
07:50:59,840 --> 07:51:13,479
i think i think thanos is a great character now we talk about on the good side not just a

2312
07:51:13,479 --> 07:51:30,040
villain thanos is actually pretty good in infinity war movie thanos or comic thanos i

2313
07:51:30,040 --> 07:51:34,939
mean yeah there are differences and i know the whole story i know thanos's entire story

2314
07:51:37,340 --> 07:51:41,900
but for every time i bring up something that somebody hasn't seen yet i get screamed after

2315
07:51:41,900 --> 07:51:51,959
spoilers you have no idea what comic thanos is oh well i'll block your ears for a second everybody

2316
07:51:51,959 --> 07:51:56,279
if you don't want to hear anything the whole uh three two one i don't know what i think i think

2317
07:51:56,279 --> 07:52:01,240
about thanos except the fact that his entire life is about trying to please and uh fall

2318
07:52:01,240 --> 07:52:05,560
in love with the actual embodiment of death and that's why he does the things that he does

2319
07:52:05,560 --> 07:52:10,840
because he's trying to impress death pretty interesting take on the comic book version of

2320
07:52:10,840 --> 07:52:29,840
the thanos he read the wikipedia i read the comic book i have it i own it okay you can listen now

2321
07:52:34,919 --> 07:52:40,970
show it on stream you want to show it on stream fine let no way actually that didn't

2322
07:52:40,970 --> 07:53:04,919
i got lost in the mail during the move i gave it to my uh my nephew yeah you didn't even

2323
07:53:04,919 --> 07:53:20,080
know that it got lost and then you gave it to your nephew huh no no no he's trying to

2324
07:53:20,080 --> 07:53:24,639
make the embodiment of death and that's why he does the things that he does

2325
07:53:24,639 --> 07:53:31,599
he travels from planet to planet and look guy that has one talking point repeat the same

2326
07:53:31,599 --> 07:53:44,200
talking point but change the sentence a little bit good job you read his tldr wiki all right

2327
07:53:44,200 --> 07:53:51,770
what do you know about him huh what do you know about him if you're such an expert let's

2329
07:53:59,930 --> 07:54:06,650
to hear any thanos spoilers three two one the fact that the fight with wolverine the fight with

2330
07:54:06,650 --> 07:54:10,970
deadpool the fact that deadpool is the only one that could even hurt him in the first place

2331
07:54:10,970 --> 07:54:16,409
because he didn't really lose the fight against deadpool deadpool just was annoying because he

2332
07:54:16,409 --> 07:54:21,450
wouldn't die so thanos just got bored and it turned out to be a victory for deadpool

2333
07:54:21,450 --> 07:54:34,599
you remember that you read that one i just made that up that means that i have more

2334
07:54:34,599 --> 07:54:40,119
knowledge of the superhero universe than gondor lane does i will take the victory thank you very

2339
07:55:23,200 --> 07:55:28,479

2340
07:55:28,479 --> 07:55:36,139
is my favorite super hero or villain i love carnage is a great character it's carnage what

2341
07:55:36,139 --> 07:55:42,220
do you know about carnage separation anxiety storyline the it's one of my favorite actual like

2342
07:55:42,220 --> 07:55:47,659
no jokes aside not kidding or anything the separation anxiety story arc with spider-man

2343
07:55:47,659 --> 07:55:57,479
venom and carnage is one is my favorite marvel storyline and i would love if they would actually

2344
07:55:57,479 --> 07:56:12,810
do it eventually what about ant-man though no fuck ant-man they took honey i shrunk the kids

2345
07:56:12,810 --> 07:56:17,119
and made paul rudd say some jokes it's like they tell honey i shrunk the kids but they

2346
07:56:17,119 --> 07:56:27,840
give the kids superpowers i've already seen that movie i'm i'm kidding i'm kidding that's

2347
07:56:27,840 --> 07:56:39,400
a joke that was an expert ant-man analysis i'm just i'm just pushing buttons right now

2348
07:56:39,400 --> 07:56:44,680
don't you understand i almost just pushed the camera on button as a joke like i'm pressing

2349
07:56:44,680 --> 07:56:59,290
buttons and i don't have clothes on so that would have been bad he likes to start shit i'm

2350
07:56:59,290 --> 07:57:05,930
just kidding around but venom is one of my favorite carnages i just like the symbiotes

2351
07:57:05,930 --> 07:57:11,000
they're interesting something about them are cool is the spider-man symbiote was really

2352
07:57:11,000 --> 07:57:16,759
interesting the fact that he could have used it and he did but he didn't want to i like

2353
07:57:16,759 --> 07:57:20,279
that whole arc the whole arc with venom and carnage is really interesting to me

2354
07:57:21,000 --> 07:57:27,470
because they're not just two there are a shitload of symbiotes there are like at least four or five

2355
07:57:27,470 --> 07:57:33,840
suits because there's a whole race of aliens didn't need the wikipedia open for that one did i

2356
07:57:36,459 --> 07:57:41,369
how did this even start oh yeah that's my favorite villain thank you tingy for the

2357
07:57:41,369 --> 07:57:44,970

07:57:45,610 --> 07:57:54,990
hi jerma hi bet three i have not seen into the spider-verse i've heard it is unbelievable

2359
07:57:54,990 --> 07:58:06,349
so can't wait they're not a race of aliens the earth suits all split from venom there's a whole

2360
07:58:06,349 --> 07:58:16,159
alien race of those symbiotes just because they were children of venom because he ate after

2361
07:58:16,159 --> 07:58:33,200
midnight doesn't mean there's not a whole planet full of them thank you tingy for the

2362
07:58:33,200 --> 07:58:38,889
two dollars thank you give us p for another two dollars why are you doing this i don't know

2363
07:58:38,889 --> 07:58:45,819
why are you doing this thank you kill code for the one dollar hey germa old clip time

2364
07:58:45,819 --> 07:58:51,689
hope you enjoy don't dodge here that's the one thing i remember about blight town

2365
07:58:52,330 --> 07:59:09,020
do not dodge ever don't ever do it you will regret it i know a lot of people think

2366
07:59:09,900 --> 07:59:16,569
that some of this shit is on purpose like i'm trying to bait reactions or something or i'm

2367
07:59:16,569 --> 07:59:25,369
doing it to try to play up something no that i i don't i don't mean to that didn't happen

2368
07:59:35,369 --> 07:59:41,369
sometimes of course i do some of these things on purpose but you all know when that is because we

2369
07:59:41,369 --> 07:59:49,040
talk about them in real time or there's a joke that's being made but stuff like that i that

2370
07:59:49,040 --> 07:59:55,020
that that happens what was the last time that that happened and i went on like an actual

2371
07:59:55,020 --> 07:59:58,299
meltdown about how people were going to think this was a joke and a lie and i was like

2372
07:59:58,299 --> 08:00:09,840
pretending it was pretty recent it was like a couple of streams ago what was it the slap

2373
08:00:09,919 --> 08:00:21,259
yep the slap that's exactly that's yep but how could i i read a thread and somebody wrote he

2374
08:00:21,259 --> 08:00:28,459
literally did the most impossible physically mechanically impossible way to slap yourself

2375
08:00:28,459 --> 08:00:40,639
it has to been fake it was something along those lines i read it and i'm just like

2376
08:00:41,439 --> 08:00:49,470
uh i almost wish it was on purpose because then at least internally it wouldn't be that

2377
08:00:49,470 --> 08:01:02,279
embarrassing i've never seen anyone do that yeah i just got too amped up but i got too into like

2378
08:01:02,279 --> 08:01:10,319
the joke and i overestimated how far i had to go and i had to preview of all the things

2379
08:01:10,319 --> 08:01:19,369
to turn the webcam on and do hitting yourself in the fucking face i still can't believe it

2380
08:01:22,380 --> 08:01:31,869
fake slap it's fake oh and spilling and running into the uh uh buckets of water

2381
08:01:31,869 --> 08:01:36,750
in viscera cleanup detail none of those were fucking fake they were all real all of them

2382
08:01:36,750 --> 08:01:50,240
jerma i refuse to believe it's real i tried to replicate what you did and every time my hand

2383
08:01:50,240 --> 08:02:00,540
refused to slap my face but i i don't i was trying look here's the thought process here

2384
08:02:00,540 --> 08:02:07,240
i'm gonna try to explain this as best as i can i did it twice what three times right

2385
08:02:07,240 --> 08:02:13,240
the first time i was moving very slow and it wasn't that funny because it wasn't fast

2386
08:02:13,799 --> 08:02:19,720
so oh look i'm trying to pretend oh i missed you and i three stooges but in my mind it wasn't

2387
08:02:19,720 --> 08:02:27,880
as funny because my hand wasn't moving that fast so future me decided i'm gonna move my hand

2388
08:02:27,880 --> 08:02:33,319
really fucking fast so when i have the slap noise play it'll be it'll be perfect and it'll

2389
08:02:33,319 --> 08:02:42,520
actually look funny i'm trying really hard to replicate it and i can't don't don't try to

2390
08:02:42,520 --> 08:02:47,400
replicate don't try to slap yourself in the face no don't do that don't try this at home

2391
08:02:49,659 --> 08:02:53,099
hey sweat night thanks for the ten dollar sweat night hey jerma glad to see you're enjoying

2392
08:02:53,099 --> 08:02:57,740
dragon's dogma so much as is one of my favorite rpg games despite all of its flaws

2393
08:02:58,380 --> 08:03:02,860
if you want another great game by the same director i would strongly recommend devil may

2394
08:03:02,860 --> 08:03:08,860
cry three like dark souls it often gets a bad rap for being extremely hard but once you

2395
08:03:08,860 --> 08:03:12,779
get into it you'll see that it's a great game with some of the funnest combat and cut scenes

2396
08:03:12,779 --> 08:03:18,459
in video game history not that difficult not that difficulty should be a problem for you

2397
08:03:19,180 --> 08:03:30,110
you god gamer and then the new devil may cry is coming out there's so many video games

2398
08:03:30,750 --> 08:03:36,639
eventually there's going to be video game libraries because that's what happened with

2399
08:03:36,639 --> 08:03:42,650
books think about that too many books were written so they had to start to make giant

2400
08:03:42,650 --> 08:03:48,639
buildings to put them in places back when they were like 40 books that were written

2401
08:03:49,279 --> 08:03:55,599
that didn't matter now we got entire gigantic structures to hold the shit load of books that

2402
08:03:55,599 --> 08:03:57,840
have been written that's going to happen they're going to be video game libraries

2403
08:03:58,479 --> 08:04:13,799
it's called the internet yeah but it'll be you can there'll be a card catalog you go

2404
08:04:13,799 --> 08:04:20,599
through g g god of god of war goddess god of war one god of war two god of war three god of

2405
08:04:20,599 --> 08:04:28,360
war five god of war attack of the clones god of war and then in brackets 2018 god like there's

2406
08:04:28,360 --> 08:04:46,250
gonna be 30 god of wars there gears of war gears of war two gears of war three gears of real

2407
08:04:46,250 --> 08:04:50,840
mobile gears of war four gears of war five gears of four six you think they're gonna stop

2408
08:04:50,840 --> 08:04:55,959
making call of duties they'll be in an entire military section of this library

2409
08:04:56,680 --> 08:05:08,970
that in that catalog will be 250 call of duty slots it's so weird to think about that

2410
08:05:08,970 --> 08:05:14,889
because it's a joke now right that's a joke now oh they make a call of duty every fucking year

2411
08:05:14,889 --> 08:05:21,659
they're not gonna stop doing that for a very long time think of how many there are now and

2412
08:05:21,659 --> 08:05:37,150
think of how many there will be in a hundred years what the hell is gonna happen there this

2413
08:05:37,150 --> 08:05:43,950
is like your olympics prediction right see you all in five years yeah i got a lot of shit for

2414
08:05:43,950 --> 08:05:49,319
that don't make me bring up the olympics video the video games at olympics video

2415
08:05:51,119 --> 08:06:00,169
i was laughed out of town when i made that video i was all the top comments it was just like this

2416
08:06:00,169 --> 08:06:04,490
is the dumbest thing i think you've ever said why the hell would this ever happen like okay

2420
08:06:32,270 --> 08:06:46,430
idiot but i'll be smug as i want but that one the video has five and a half thousand upvotes

2421
08:06:46,430 --> 08:06:51,229
and only 100 downvotes yeah because i already talked about it on stream and a bunch of people

2422
08:06:51,229 --> 08:06:58,540
went and made sure that they you know changed their history there and then you know i said

2423
08:06:58,540 --> 08:07:02,459
that comment about how he was like a dumb asshole i gotta go back and like upvote the

2424
08:07:02,459 --> 08:07:05,259
video and really like edit that comment hey man like that's kind of yeah i thought about

2425
08:07:05,259 --> 08:07:08,619
this too i thought that that was like a good idea too when i thought about it like uh like

2426
08:07:08,619 --> 08:07:22,880
a few years ago german 95 you're boring activate smart click map so we have something to do

2427
08:07:23,840 --> 08:07:29,709
all right we'll see hey we'll see in about five years when you think about that what you just

2428
08:07:29,709 --> 08:07:31,869
wrote right there and then you're gonna go back and be like oh i probably shouldn't have

2429
08:07:31,869 --> 08:07:44,009
said that anyways thank you sweat night devil may cry seems like a really awesome series i've

2430
08:07:44,009 --> 08:07:50,700
never played one second of any of the games i'm sure you'll see it on stream eventually

2447
08:10:20,459 --> 08:10:25,310
tingy thanks for the two dollars here i wanted to see how long it would take you to notice

2448
08:10:25,310 --> 08:10:30,110
me doing that right went from one dollar per stream to this today because it was taking

2449
08:10:30,110 --> 08:10:38,619
too long by the way it took six dollars for you to catch it but what was it for me to

2450
08:10:38,619 --> 08:10:46,409
i was just reading your message i knew what you were doing but i just i just was i knew what

2451
08:10:46,409 --> 08:10:53,049
you were doing i have stream labs it has a who sent the bits it's not like i could couldn't

2452
08:10:53,049 --> 08:11:01,610
tell who sent them what fingers are your favorite least favorite uh index and thumb no middle

2453
08:11:01,610 --> 08:11:08,189
finger and thumb are my favorite fingers i hate ring finger it sucks it's stupid they're

2454
08:11:08,189 --> 08:11:11,869
always in a weird spot it's hard to move them around it's hard to maneuver them they

2455
08:11:11,869 --> 08:11:21,319
hurt sometimes trying to do certain tasks hey demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar

2456
08:11:21,319 --> 08:11:26,040
i've always wondered do you actually read comics if so what's your poll list if you

2457
08:11:26,040 --> 08:11:31,880
don't i'd recommend the current venom and carnage runs also venom which is venom but

2458
08:11:31,880 --> 08:11:44,360
set in the vietnam war that's really interesting uh i mean i i have in the past but all the

2459
08:11:44,360 --> 08:11:49,740
jokes aside i don't currently read any i think the last actual comic book that i opened

2460
08:11:50,380 --> 08:11:55,479
was probably civil war that's probably the last one that i opened and looked at and was like i'm

2461
08:11:55,479 --> 08:12:03,000
gonna read this see his clicks i hear them but my hands are on my desk folded like a fucking villain

2462
08:12:03,799 --> 08:12:20,349
do i use old school obs i do i use uh obs studio i don't use the stream labs one you

2463
08:12:20,349 --> 08:12:27,529
complained a lot about wwe 2k 17 18 19 why not the next rumble go back to 2k 14 uh i've

2464
08:12:27,529 --> 08:12:30,330
talked about a couple of the reasons why the number one reason is because it just takes

2465
08:12:30,330 --> 08:12:38,759
too long to load once you have 20 30 40 characters made in 2k 14 and once you have

2466
08:12:38,759 --> 08:12:45,080
10 20 plus layers on one character it can take 30 to 40 seconds to load hair on somebody

2467
08:12:46,040 --> 08:12:55,180
it's just it doesn't hold up if they was a 2k 14 for pc they decided in 2k 15 forward

2468
08:12:55,180 --> 08:13:01,520
to put them on pc but that's the last one that's the last really good creator it just

2469
08:13:01,520 --> 08:13:07,819
doesn't hold up old playstation 3 hardware late generation playstation 3 game trying to just

2470
08:13:07,819 --> 08:13:17,200
dump as much shit as they can so it just takes too long to make one character especially if you

2471
08:13:17,200 --> 08:13:29,229
want to do a lot of stuff to them the creativity was nice i know and they got rid

2472
08:13:29,229 --> 08:13:32,669
of the whole cinematic stuff where you could make your own little stories and have weird

2473
08:13:32,669 --> 08:13:39,680
shit happen with characters it really is too bad but they it's too bad they made that a

2474
08:13:39,680 --> 08:13:50,240
sports simulation game oh well you should be able to emulate it emulating playstation 3 games is

2475
08:13:50,240 --> 08:13:58,889
just so finicky half of them don't even work it's really hard to do some of the emulators

2476
08:13:58,889 --> 08:14:04,009
are better than others but i've had so many problems trying to get past the playstation

2477
08:14:04,009 --> 08:14:17,209
1 era emulators to work even remotely correctly we're not far enough into technology i think to

2478
08:14:17,209 --> 08:14:24,270
be able to truly emulate like last gen games it's just i don't think it's there yet and it

2479
08:14:24,270 --> 08:14:29,849
might not ever be because it's really easy to emulate the data that was on a cartridge

2480
08:14:30,569 --> 08:14:36,169
stuff like super nintendo genesis n64 they're all very emulatable even playstation 1 and into

2481
08:14:36,169 --> 08:14:48,860
playstation 2 somewhat shanesaw five community subs thank you shanesaw thank you so much

2482
08:14:49,819 --> 08:14:56,360
five community subs rpcs3 has a lot of stuff working well at the moment give it another year

2483
08:14:56,360 --> 08:15:03,689
and i bet it's amazing i hope so because if i could use my you know powerful computer to render

2484
08:15:03,689 --> 08:15:08,330
shit that's in a playstation 3 emulated version of 2k14 i would do it in a heartbeat

2485
08:15:08,889 --> 08:15:18,029
but it just doesn't work right now but thank you so much shanes uh shanesaw

2486
08:15:19,439 --> 08:15:22,240

2502
08:17:12,569 --> 08:17:20,319
what is this delay i don't know maybe it's uh i don't know that's really weird i jumped with

2503
08:17:20,319 --> 08:17:25,930

2508
08:18:26,250 --> 08:18:40,909
canadian club but dragon's dog was a lot of fun i'm not sure the plan tomorrow because there

2509
08:18:40,909 --> 08:18:50,189
are so many options that it's i almost don't know what i'm gonna do it really depends on

2510
08:18:50,189 --> 08:18:54,590
what because there are some things that are planned on coming in for delivery tomorrow

2511
08:18:55,229 --> 08:19:08,650
you can also just play this too dark souls 3 the mods look like a lot of fun one of them in

2512
08:19:08,650 --> 08:19:15,209
particular i thought was really funny is there's a mod for dark souls 3 that randomizes the speed

2513
08:19:15,209 --> 08:19:27,470
of the game so it can go in slow motion up to like fast forward speed that sounds like actual

2514
08:19:27,470 --> 08:19:34,430
help yeah sounds like fun though there's one where you can play as the enemies too that's

2515
08:19:34,430 --> 08:19:39,069
probably good i i have to check them out that's going to be at least a couple streams it has to

2516
08:19:39,069 --> 08:19:52,220
be so basically you got multiple options yeah please do that tomorrow if i can get it to

2517
08:19:52,220 --> 08:19:56,700
work that's going to take a little bit of work though because with any mod or total

2518
08:19:57,259 --> 08:20:02,060
complete scripting or game changing mods there's a tendency for them to take a

2519
08:20:02,060 --> 08:20:08,729
lot of troubleshooting so i'm gonna have to spend some time tomorrow hopefully doing that

2520
08:20:09,450 --> 08:20:16,189
what's gonna be the january 23rd stream january 23rd stream is gonna be an irl hangout stream

2524
08:20:43,150 --> 08:20:51,520
