1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:20,940
I was here. For the game awards? I was here. Hi everybody. Welcome to the game awards pre-show.

2
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:31,109
And the game awards pre-show, I thought the game awards started at 5 30. No, it actually starts at

3
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:43,539
six. So I mean, I guess we could see what's gonna happen before the show starts. But I think we'll

4
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:49,579
probably just talk about Minecraft for like a half an hour. Because I was gonna do that anyways.

5
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,579
Now people probably going, why would you talk about Minecraft for a half an hour? This is a

6
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,619
perfect opportunity to do it. But I want to make sure a lot of people are here to see it.

7
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:12,409
We have a lot of important things to discuss. Because the fuck the king stream is very, very,

8
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:21,980
very rapidly approaching. We're going to go over it. We'll talk about it. We'll see it. Well,

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,650
actually, what are they? What do they do? They start on time? That's a better question. Did

10
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,129
they start on time? No, it's a black screen. No, that's like an ad. What is this? What's this?

11
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:39,129
What's this an ad for? I can't even hear it. What is this? To the Twitch partner program.

12
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:48,790
We got partner boys. Twitch ad. Should I not be showing this? Who just gifted like a thousand subs?

13
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:54,950
Wow. Thank you so much for the 10,000 bits. Thank you so much. All right, we're gonna

14
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:03,989
let's go back to this. Wait, hold on. The whole purpose for that was to see what was going on

15
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:14,860
on their stream. Don't do it again. They're late. They're late. It's supposed to start at 5 30. It's

16
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,340
going to start at like 5 36. See? See? Even like a multi-million dollar production is six to seven

17
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:39,800
minutes late. So come on. Their broadcast probably costs like five million bucks. Right now,

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,319
Jeff Keely is about to write in his chat. Oh, gosh. There's internet problems here, guys.

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:56,340
Cox is fucking up. I gotta let Otto up. Hold on. I'll be back. I forgot to go to the bathroom today,

20
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,780
guys. Give me like another 10 minutes. Have I eaten food today? No, I haven't. I ate a

21
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:17,289
microwave burrito three days ago. I have to eat. Facecam, please. Everybody wants the facecam

22
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:31,530
turned on for some reason. We got three minutes to the game awards. Oh, we gotta talk about

23
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,750
Minecraft. Right. All right. Minecraft. I gotta get something on the screen. Forget about the game.

24
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,860
The pre-show. It's like the it's going to the movies. Okay. If you've been to the movies more

25
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:53,030
than once or twice in a month, you've seen all the previews. So, but the third movie you go to

26
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,990
in the month of December is going to be the same previews that you saw two weeks ago. You know,

27
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:03,000
who cares? You've already seen it. You've already seen the trailer for Gemini Man 15 times. You

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,139
don't need to see it again. So we're going to talk about Minecraft. Yes, I do. No, you don't.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,779
I got to turn off actually. No, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important.

30
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:27,339
This is really actually important to me. What time is it? I'm sitting here for two minutes.

31
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,779
I want to see if they start in two minutes. I hope the counter goes up. I hope the counter

32
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:38,860
goes up like another three minutes. I'm going to sit here for two minutes. We're not going to

33
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:46,220
watch like a second of the pre-show just to make sure we're clear on this. Why is everybody calling

34
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,860
me a villain? Because I decided that today I was going to relax today. But that makes me a villain.

35
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:07,139
Oh, you want to just like take a load off and relax. Don't comb your hair back. It's it sets

36
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:16,870
there. I like the way that it sets. It's this. This is what I do on my days off. Listen to this

37
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,389
epic music. People are giving subs and shit. Splarg gave five community subs. And, and,

38
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,910
and something else happened too. What else happened? Right now something happened.

39
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,629
I don't have notifications on because this is a video game award. So I'm just going to give

40
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:36,870
a hundred dollars. Uh, Freddie Dredd, 10,000 bits. Thank you, Freddie Dredd.

41
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:46,459
A hundred fucking, uh, 10,000 bits. Can I be in that ad? 10,000 bits.

42
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,410
What? Uh, no, but seriously, that's a lot of fucking money. Thank you, Freddie.

43
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,839
40 seconds. Thanks for the hundred dollars. We haven't even gotten started yet. There's

44
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,519
nothing on the screen yet. All right. Here are my predictions for game of the year.

45
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,750
Game of the year. I got to say it now before we, before everybody else comes on the camera,

46
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,790
that's not me and tells you their predictions. Game of the year. Resident Evil 2. If Resident

47
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:20,860
Evil 2 does not win game of the year this year, games, gaming is dead. Video games are dead.

48
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:35,209
It's over. If Resident Evil 2 does not win. That's a fact. Okay. Let's see. It's five,

49
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:59,769
it's five 36 right now. Here it comes. Oh, it's not ready. What's going on?

50
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:05,370
Host for the game awards 2019 pre-show. The game awards will begin at the top of the hour

51
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,089
featuring musical performances by Green Day. Green Day's here? And brand new looks at ghosts

52
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:17,610
of Tsushima and Gears tactics. But while the Microsoft feature fills in behind me and the

53
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,290
world gets their popcorn ready, we've got 30 minutes of awards, special guests, and world

54
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:30,170
premieres of our own right here in the pre-show, including a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy

55
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:38,699
VII Remake. Haven't they shown a new trailer for this game like the last five years? By handing

56
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,220
out our first trophy of the night. And this is a special one. The game awards have a new category

57
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,779
this year to honor the teams that honor their community. The best community support award goes

58
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,699
to a game that listens, reacts, and responds to its players with respect and transparency.

59
00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:05,220
The nominees for best community support are Apex Legends. Best community? Oh, okay. This is the

60
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:15,269
company that patches their game the most. But what if the game is broken and fucked up from the

61
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:20,949
beginning? And the winner is? Does that make you, I guess, what patches? It's gonna be Fortnite

62
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:32,120
season two. Destiny 2. They were right, they were right there. Congratulations. Thank you very much.

63
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,399
This is a, this is really an honor. I gotta acknowledge the people at Bungie who've worked

64
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,559
so hard to, you know, support our community, starting with our community team, who are on

65
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,480
the front lines every day interacting with our fans, the core development team, our operations folks,

66
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,440
like, everyone up and down just cares so much about this game, and I just, I gotta acknowledge

67
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,639
all their hard work. I don't play it, no. The only thing I'd add is everyone here creates

68
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,240
entertainment, and what use is creating entertainment if you don't have awesome fans, so

69
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,840
special thanks to our fans. That's amazing. Well, congratulations again. Thank you so much. Thank

70
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,399
you. What, was Reggie playing Destiny 2? I didn't know it won. Huge congratulations to Destiny 2

71
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,360
for winning our first ever best community support award. I'm sure it's no coincidence they are also

72
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,519
up for the best ongoing game later tonight. Now, the game awards is a show about celebrating all

73
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,279
of gaming. I haven't paid any attention so far. Throughout the night, you'll see unexpected

74
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,799
additions to games you love, check-ins on games you're anticipating, and reveals you never saw

75
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:44,710
coming. Here's the first of many world premieres. First preview. I can sense a great cosmic

76
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,309
disturbance. We must be prepared for the worst. Time to change history for the better.

77
00:09:53,259 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh my god, that was so fucking loud, and it was all my fault. I'm so sorry guys, that was all my

78
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:10,360
fault. I turned it up by turning something up over there. That was seriously like somebody just

79
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,720
punched you in the face. Like, I just punched you in the face. Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

80
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:31,750
Our first world premiere. Didn't this game already come out? I thought this game already came out.

81
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:41,129
I will blend things. Rise of the feast. Oh, there's no Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Right,

82
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,539
right, right, right, okay. Oh, I gotta turn the camera off when that happens.

83
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:52,019
In 2018, the game awards teamed up with Facebook Gaming to honor global gaming citizens. People

84
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,379
from all areas of gaming who use the power of games to create a positive influence. Tonight,

85
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,899
I'm joined by one of the global gaming citizens we met last year who has a new project to show us.

86
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:09,779
Please welcome Luol Mayen. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Yeah. So Luol, what have you

87
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,139
been working on? Yeah, for sure. You know, as someone from Africa and also as a refugee,

88
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,460
I want to thank everybody that has been supporting me to come up with a game today.

89
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,059
Facebook Gaming, Eisenbeck, and Luol Deng. I've been working on a game that actually put a player

90
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:30,580
in the shoes of a refugee. It's a game that actually talk about journey and helping people

91
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,220
to understand their empathy and this is something that video game can be able to do around the world.

92
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,940
We can be able to change the world and help people around the world and see what whatever

93
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,500
they're going through through playing video game. So it's a game really that put a player in the

94
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,179
shoes of refugees and bridging the reality world and what is actually happening on the ground.

95
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,259
So I'm really so excited about the project. Incredible. Well, let's take a look. Yeah,

96
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,860
sure. We got a trailer? Why would I turn the camera on for the trailer? Because games are

97
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,659
very powerful to create empathy and to help people understand a journey of a refugee.

98
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,860
Growing up in a refugee camp, my mother spent three years looking for $300 to buy a computer.

99
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,019
Then I taught myself how to create a video game. My mission in creating Salam is to let the world

100
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,299
know what it's like to be a refugee. When you buy medicine and food in the game, it goes to real

101
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:25,700
refugees, refugees like me. Together, we can take small steps to make a big difference.

102
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:34,090
What is Facebook Instant Games? It's so great to show you games like Salam. We have such a unique

103
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,049
opportunity here at the Game Awards to shine our spotlight on games big and small. Look forward

104
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:44,570
to seeing some more interesting Indies later tonight. This next Game Awards category also

105
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:50,009
demonstrates this kind of diversity in gaming. The nominees represent completely different budgets,

106
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:56,009
nationalities, and genres, but they all share one thing, excellent music. Here are the nominees

107
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:02,090
for best score in music. Cadence of Hyrule. They're really running. They're really sprinting.

108
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,450
Death Stranding. It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 because of like, it's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3.

109
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,169
Devil May Cry 5. It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3. Kingdom Hearts 3.

110
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,889
Right. Listen to that. Listen to me. And Sayonara Wild Hearts.

111
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:26,379
And the winner is... This is unfair though. See, even she's like, yeah. Death Stranding.

112
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:36,919
Oh shit. I was going to say it's like Disney songs. You can't compete with Let It Go.

113
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,039
I don't know what to do. I like your colors. Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. I like your colors

114
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,279
as well. How are you feeling? I've been nervous this whole week and I can't believe this is

115
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,120
happening right now. I just want to say big thanks and shout out and also a congratulations

116
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,320
to Low Roar Churches and Southern Poets for helping us. I'm talking about Minecraft. All right.

117
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,600
Why am I talking about Minecraft? I'm just super happy to be here and I'm super thankful

118
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,720
for all the fans who inspired us to do something super weird and I hope we can

119
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,299
keep on doing weird shit going forward. All right. We'll do it after.

120
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,700
I think we all hope that. We only got like 16 minutes. I needed like 30 to talk about this.

121
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,830
For the past two E3s, there's been one game featured in the PC gaming show that continues

122
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,669
to fill our imagination with endless possibilities. I'm talking, of course, about Maneater,

123
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:32,389
the game where you are a killer shark that eats people. If you're hungry for more Maneater,

124
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:37,190
here's a new world premiere. What is Maneater? This is the first time I've ever heard anyone

125
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:45,539
talk about this. Hey, gamers. You know that thing that we've never spoken about? Here it is.

126
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,419
But only five humans are killed by sharks. It's time to even the score.

127
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:07,929
Isn't this game on Newgrounds right now? It's a Newgrounds game.

128
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,159
Can I evolve legs? I'll play it if I can get legs to walk around and I get in a car and drive

129
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:48,970
around. All right. Stephen Curry will be here tonight to award the best esports player of 2019,

130
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,250
but for now, I have the honor of acknowledging the winners for some esports categories.

131
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:07,000
For best esports coach, the nominees are Adrian, Kane, Koma, Soksha, and Zonic.

132
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:19,179
And the winner is Zonic. So do we only use handles now? The nominees are the 2019

133
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:39,480
League of Legends World Championships. I based this on which one of these I actually watched,

134
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,759
and I didn't watch any of them. I think, no, no, no, I caught like maybe two hours of EVO.

135
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,179
How many, how many fans does this game have?

136
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,119
I wish they would show what they're like in brackets their name. And for best esports team,

137
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:23,059
the nominees are Astralis, G2 Esports. I'm so removed from this. I have, I don't know any of

138
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,259
these things. You know when like the older generation gets old enough and then they look

139
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,700
back and they go, I don't, I don't know what this is. I'm in that moment now. I mean, I think this

140
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,460
is cool as shit, but I don't know any of these things. I don't know any of these things. I think

141
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,220
it's cool shit though. He's a boomer.

142
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,380
Where the game awards are part of a special double feature with Jumanji the next level.

143
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,740
We're about to take a short break, but first here's a little message from a couple of the

144
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:01,380
stars of Jumanji the next level. Jumanji? What's up game awards? What's up PlayStation?

145
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:09,700
We checked out dreams. Oh boy. It was trippy. We're in a game. Yeah, no kidding. Especially

146
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:17,380
your face. That was sculpted in dreams by the way. You can be the judge when you see it for

147
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,259
yourself. Oh, that's crazy. We can't wait for you to see Jumanji the next level. That's actually

148
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,440
insane. I can't say this enough. We're in a video game. I'm not gonna watch this movie, but wait,

149
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:57,160
this is Jumanji single. What's coming up next? What's the next, what's the next preview? Now,

150
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,480
these are video games. That's, now this one was good. I actually really liked that one.

151
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:29,829
That one was, not so good. I'm sorry. He hated it. I didn't hate it. What's next? Tell me so much.

152
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:54,660
Back to the game awards pre-show. This summer, I had the pleasure of joining Jeff to co-host

153
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,259
Gamescom opening night live. And one of the games we revealed that night was Amplitude Studios

154
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:05,299
Humankind. Here to unveil a new gameplay feature and the first trailer with gameplay,

155
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:13,299
please welcome Jeff Spock. Hey Jeff. Hi, thanks Cindy. I'm very excited and kind of terrified

156
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,180
to be here. I'm here to answer a question we've been hearing constantly since we announced the

157
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,220
game this summer. And the question is, who am I playing? Am I playing a king, a queen, a historical

158
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,579
figure, leader of a civilization? He knows we're talking about Minecraft. Tonight we can announce

159
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:32,099
that you are going to play you. The idea is that you're going to create a highly customizable

160
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:37,539
avatar that will evolve visually as you play the game. So as you make gameplay decisions,

161
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,220
as you win achievements, as you select cultures and that sort of thing, you'll see that evolve

162
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,019
on the avatar itself, which means that at the end of the game you'll have sort of a record

163
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:54,980
and a trophy of how you changed humankind. We have tons of ideas of where the avatar system can go.

164
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,940
We're very excited about it. But if I talk about them, the programmers will literally disembowel me

165
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:08,259
when I get home. So in order to avoid that, we put together a trailer. So we have a game experience

166
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,779
and gameplay trailer to showcase the human avatar system. Beautiful. Why don't we take a look?

167
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,740
All right, here we go. I'm ready for this. This actually sounds like it could be good.

168
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:34,890
It all started way back. Back to basics. Ah, days. Gathering, hunting, and well,

169
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:42,410
back to gathering. We switched from a cold to a cool place to settle. And I found the perfect

170
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,769
spot for my people. At first it was just a few walls to keep the bears out and the pigs in.

171
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:53,930
But you know how it is. One district led to another and it kind of snowballed.

172
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:59,769
Now the problem was the neighbors thought the grass was greener on my side of the fence.

173
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,569
But we saw them disembowel me. All I had to do was give the order. It really hurt. Their first

174
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:14,730
mistake, bringing infantry to a cavalry fight. Next, losing the high ground. Final mistake,

175
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:24,329
not keeping up in the arms race. But eventually peace prevailed. They surrendered and I let them

176
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:32,069
live. It turns out we had a lot to learn from them. And together we became more than the sum of our

177
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:38,470
parts, a unique mix of cultures and beliefs. So yeah, I would say I left my mark on humankind

178
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,670
and I'm just getting started. Is this civilization?

179
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:48,180
That's just my story. Tell me, what will yours be?

180
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,140
Oh by the way, what the fuck's going on with the Apple Arcade? I bought Apple Arcade and it's like

181
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,700
a hundred games and we add, they haven't added anything. It's been like three and a half weeks

182
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,940
since they've added a new game to the Apple Arcade. What's going on there? I keep checking

183
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,420
it and it says nothing there. It's the same like 80 games. They honestly haven't even told me what

184
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,259
it is yet. So I am just as in the dark as all of you right now. And I got to say it's pretty

185
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:19,259
exciting. I really have no clue what to expect right now, but we're all in this together. So

186
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:26,140
let's all kick back and enjoy this one. Another world premiere. Oh, look at all these world,

187
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:42,009
go ahead and world premiere, world premiere, world premiere. I thought that was Eric Cartman. For one

188
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:56,200
second. I was like, that's Eric Cartman speaking. What? What the fuck? 20 years he's back and he's

189
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:08,460
here to take over the world. He's back to take over. Who? You? Damon. I love you. Do it. These

190
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:20,170
superheroes are popular and they're gonna jump on that. What are you? I'm a goddamn superhero.

191
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:31,220
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

192
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,529
Okay. So I'm glad they're actually making that game and not like that weird top down VR fake

193
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,970
reality. Ghostbusters top down game. I don't even know why they did that.

194
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:14,490
If you're on TikTok, get off now. Get off now and secure your data. Change all your passwords.

195
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,450
Fortnite VR? Why is there Fortnite VR?

196
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:49,900
I talked a lot of shit about this game like last year. Let's see if I'm proven wrong.

197
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:33,769
You've seen this. They keep re-editing the same footage three years straight.

198
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,859
What if this never comes out? What if we keep getting re-edits of trailers for the next like

199
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:56,740
six years to keep Square Enix's stock up? This is an earnings call thing, guy.

200
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:16,410
This is an earnings call thing. This is never coming up. All right, it's coming up tomorrow.

201
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:27,450
Best fighting game? Mortal Kombat 11.

202
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:47,460
Samurai Showdown and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. And we're gonna get the final DLC

203
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,339
character. The gentleman right here, they're gonna reveal the final DLC character. It's gonna be

204
00:27:50,339 --> 00:28:05,500
Scorpion. Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. Congratulations. It's heavy. It is, isn't it?

205
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,380
They're just right there. Thank you Game Awards and thank you everyone out there very, very much.

206
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,420
You know, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is really more than just a fighting game. It's an experience

207
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:21,660
that brings people together. It's also a showcase for some of the most famous characters, music,

208
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,380
game worlds, and video game history. And the fact that all of this comes together so seamlessly and

209
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,700
so beautifully is really a testament to the dedication, to the hard work, and to the skill

210
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,579
of Mr. Sakurai and the development team. This award is for them. Thank you very, very much.

211
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:47,799
I like them. I like them. I want to see the other, I want to see the camera pull out.

212
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,839
We are now just seconds away from the start of the big show. How excited is everybody?

213
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:00,599
There's just like a queue up to the stage. The Game Awards orchestra is prepared. Jeff Keely

214
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,839
is buttoning up his tux. They pull back. Everyone here in the live audience seems ready to go.

215
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:15,539
Fuck, this is a long line. Yeah, let's hear it. It's going to be such a special show. Green Day,

216
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,220
churches, and Grimes will all be performing. There are a bunch of world premieres that are

217
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,859
going to amaze everyone and I honestly have no idea who is going to win Game of the Year.

218
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,859
But that's a wrap on our pre-show. I'm Sydney Goodman. Have fun and enjoy the show.

219
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:39,539
The Game Awards starts right now. Yeah, that's it. I'm going to get up and leave the theater now.

220
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,059
I just bought my ticket to see the previews. That's all I care about. I'm just gone.

221
00:29:44,259 --> 00:30:22,259
When the movie starts, I leave. Gemini Man is still in theaters? Why? Tell me something.

222
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:32,009
Why is it so hard for you to kill this man? Every move of mine before I made it.

223
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:53,480
What a cool trailer. What a good trailer. That's all you need. Wait, what is this?

224
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:22,119
Is it raining? Well, this isn't accurate. Let me make this accurate for you. All that equipment is

225
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:41,849
destroyed. I always feel fucking weird when I'm sitting. You know what I mean? Like, ready?

226
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:53,819
Like, it's cool to do this when you're in the audience, but you let me here just like...

227
00:31:53,819 --> 00:32:00,519
Look, I'm a much bigger audience member. I take up more space than anybody here.

228
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,869
I'm just a huge fucking audience member. I'm doing what everybody else is doing.

229
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:21,500
The show is for me.

230
00:32:52,579 --> 00:33:31,640
Pay attention. Pay attention to what? The tuba? Pay attention to the tuba.

231
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:45,029
Listen. You listen to music. You can listen to music.

232
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:59,450
Where's my reaction commentary? That's what I'm saying. When you go to a concert,

233
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,890
you're not sitting there going, awesome show. Very cool work. No, no, no. This is your

234
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:11,849
commentary. That's what you get. This is what commentary is at a show. You applaud. You say,

235
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:18,650
good. Cheer. Yeah, excellent work. During the performance, you're not going, cool.

236
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:26,969
I love this show. I'm a big fan of this show. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're doing good. You're

237
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:32,949
doing it. That'll get removed from the audience. How about that you're a heckler? What is this?

238
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:53,739
Death Stranding 2? Oh, by the way, there's like 10 years of Warcraft spoilers right there,

239
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,619
so don't tell me I'm spoiling a movie for you.

240
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:28,230
Jeff Keighley. Yeah, Jeff. Woo. Yeah. Woo. Yes. Go for it. That's what's acceptable commentary

241
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:38,119
right now. I'm Jeff Keighley. Go for it. Woo. Shut up. I can't believe this is the fifth

242
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,119
anniversary of the show, and it's so great to have all of you here. We've got so many amazing

243
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,320
special guests, Mr. Kojima, Reggie, Mr. Miyazaki. It's so exciting to have everyone here with us

244
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,199
tonight to celebrate games. First of all, let's give it up again for Churches and the Game Awards

245
00:35:54,199 --> 00:36:00,199
Orca Show. What's not beautiful? Ninja's sitting right behind Reggie. You know, tonight, one of

246
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,639
the things that really amazes me about this show is how we connect the world around games.

247
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:09,079
Do you like at some point during this thing when you're getting up to go to the bathroom?

248
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm having to get back to my seat. Reggie, I'm a huge fucking fan.

249
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,800
And then you sit back down. How do you come together all to celebrate video games? Now,

250
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,559
our show tonight, yes, we're going to have awards. Yes, we're going to have a lot of brand new game

251
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:34,739
announcements and surprises for you. So stay tuned for that. We know you like those. And we've also

252
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:45,349
got performances by Green Day and Grind. So stay tuned. It's been an outstanding year for games.

253
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,710
But to kick things off, let's get to our first award. And right now,

254
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,230
let's bring out our first presenter. He is a screenwriter and producer known for The Dark

255
00:36:52,230 --> 00:37:00,489
Knight and also the co-creator of Westworld. Please welcome Jonathan Nolan. What? Why is

256
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:10,309
Jonathan Nolan here? Good evening. I'm here to present the award for Best Narrative.

257
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,670
We talk a lot about narrative in Westworld, where our guest characters choose their own paths with

258
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:20,630
branching storylines that change based on their actions. It's an idea that we invented all by

259
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,469
ourselves. You're welcome. By the way, I could write circles around everybody here. Just wait

260
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:32,710
till I make my game. I saw that year was my answer as often as not isn't a movie. It's not a show.

261
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:38,550
It's a game. Games like Fallout, Bioshock, Half Life, Red Dead Redemption,

262
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,710
all hugely influential on our work. And you can see the echoes of those games

263
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:50,869
in our show. Everett Rachel Wood's character, Dolores, has more than a little in common with

264
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,750
Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite. James Marsden's character, Teddy, was, of course, based on

265
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:02,760
James Marsden's character in Sonic the Hedgehog. And of course, I'd be remiss if I failed to

266
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,000
mention the debt of honor that Ed Harris's character, the Man in Black, owes to Kuber.

267
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,239
So it's a true honor for me to be here tonight to recognize the amazing, thoughtful, and

268
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:17,400
groundbreaking work in narrative this year. Here are the nominees.

269
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:53,349
Everyone. And the winner is Disco Elysium.

270
00:38:54,389 --> 00:39:02,920
Tonight, Disco Elysium always wins the Game Award for Best Role Playing Game.

271
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:09,369
Imagine if one of the tech directors actually just leaked every award nomination to everyone.

272
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:23,860
It's absolutely surreal to be here. And honestly, it makes me really speechless.

273
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,739
But I definitely want to thank everyone who believed that this game exists when we first

274
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:34,900
started talking about it, because a lot of people didn't. And I want to thank the industry

275
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:42,019
for welcoming us. It's been absolutely amazing. And of course, I want to thank our fans who

276
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:51,219
really proved that these kinds of narrative games have their place in this industry.

277
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,820
And yeah, thanks a lot. This game's good, right? Would I like this game?

278
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,179
Those of you that know this channel and you're welcome. Would I like this game?

279
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:13,960
Congratulations, guys. All right. We have such a big show ahead. Now I wanted to mention right

280
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,000
now on Twitch, we've got over 900,000 concurrent viewers watching the show right now, including

281
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,480
co-streamers. So sounds like you guys are excited about what we have going on. And of course,

282
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:36,039
6,000 people here. I'm like 2% of that. What? Wait, where is it?

283
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,559
Where is that?

284
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,039
World premieres are a big part of this show. And you guys have a lot of expectations on

285
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:55,480
the internet for things or lots of rumors, lots of leaks. And then sometimes there's surprises that

286
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,199
I don't I don't know. I don't know any I don't know any of these people.

287
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:18,469
I can't I can't I don't know. Let's suppose that you were able every night to dream any

288
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:26,059
dream you wanted to dream. And then you could have the power within one night to dream.

289
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:40,920
And what if you died naturally as you began your adventure of dreams? Would you still do it?

290
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:51,059
But now let's um, let's have a surprise. Let's have a dream which isn't under control.

291
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,409
We'll get more adventurous.

292
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:04,380
Further and further out gambles as to what you would dream.

293
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,219
You guys are telling me to be quiet. And finally you will dream.

294
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:17,099
I knew this wasn't a fucking reveal. There's another ad for xbox. Wait, that's the console.

295
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:39,639
The xbox dell inspiron. The xbox all the way to the left at best buy pc.

296
00:42:39,639 --> 00:43:01,639
So it's just a computer. He's the head of xbox. Please welcome Bill Spencer. Is it just a computer?

297
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,519
That's a computer. That's right guys. It's a computer. It's a computer.

298
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:14,500
It's a computer. For 18 years and three generations, we've designed xbox consoles

299
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,980
to power your dreams. We see a future where you're instantly absorbed in your games.

300
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:27,380
Where worlds are even more like-like, immersive, responsive, and surprising.

301
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,019
Where you are at the center of your gaming experience.

302
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:38,500
Next holiday, xbox series x will lead us into the future of console gaming.

303
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:46,579
Our fastest, most powerful xbox will set a new bar for performance, speed, compatibility.

304
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:54,340
Developers around the globe are already hard at work building games for xbox series x.

305
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,260
You've revealed the console at a game award.

306
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:03,300
Our 15 xbox game studios are developing the largest and most creatively diverse lineup

307
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:11,699
of exclusive games in our history. Tonight, I'm proud to reveal a project early in development

308
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,780
from an incredibly talented creative team who are no strangers to the game awards.

309
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:24,739
What you're about to see was all captured in engine as being built

310
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:35,260
to take full advantage of xbox series x. Conquer's bad for day two.

311
00:45:37,530 --> 00:46:21,449
Is that game any good? I didn't play the first one. Do I play video games? I don't play any

312
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:25,780
fucking video games. Who should I vote for? Oh, I missed the voting period.

313
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,090
All right, the fun is just beginning. Let me assure you, we've got some other great surprises

314
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,090
coming up here at the game awards. Now we just ran a poll on twitch to see who you think is

315
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:51,369
going to be recognized as the best esports player and the results are in. Twitch community picked

316
00:46:51,369 --> 00:47:00,019
Faker. All right. 40% of the vote. Did you guys put that? You guys can do that, right?

317
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:03,860
You guys called it correctly. And still to come in the show, we've got performances by Green Day

318
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,420
and Grimes. More amazing music from the game awards orchestra. Special announcements from

319
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,780
League of Legends, Fortnite, and Apex Legends. Norman Reedus is here. Gotta make it count.

320
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:19,460
Reggie's in the house, of course. And we've got a lot more surprises that is all coming up.

321
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:24,099
But first, last year, we started a new initiative with Facebook to spotlight unique stories about

322
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,699
the gaming community around the world. This year, we've got three new amazing stories about global

323
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:35,059
gaming citizens. I'm so proud to have these in the show. And I just can't wait to share them

324
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:39,539
with you tonight. Here's our first gaming system. I'm not talking. I told you to shut up. I didn't

325
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:49,159
say anything. I was born an Afghan refugee. Growing up with the fear of am I going to be able to go

326
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:54,599
to school or not was always with me. I'm not able to go back to my country.

327
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:03,960
Afghanistan is a very traditional country. There is a huge problem here for women accessing

328
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:12,139
education. So I decided enough is enough. And I thought about coding. Code to Inspire is the first

329
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:18,460
computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan. We've developed so far more than 20 games.

330
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:24,059
Our students told me we are very tired of playing games that the men are superheroes.

331
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:29,579
And it's always pretty white men. So I was like, then why are you just going to create your own game?

332
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:39,099
When they see the game that they are playing, I'm made by women. That's an empowerment itself.

333
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,980
They understand that they have a voice and they should be heard.

334
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,989
Is it possible that the past and future are colliding?

335
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,460
This thing's sick, by the way, but just don't touch it. Be careful.

336
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,489
Up to 50% off.

337
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,889
Wait, the Joker and Harley Quinn.

338
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,130
And aren't you just as creepy as?

339
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:44,139
Don't they have their own game made by the same company? Rated M for Mature.

340
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,070
That guy just destroyed her.

341
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:19,510
To play any time, anywhere.

342
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:57,000
Somebody in chat did real good. What is this? I'm interested in this.

343
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:12,489
Wait, it's only for Oculus? No, it's not.

344
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:25,340
Do you exclude VR exclusives? Come on, the thing's like 700 bucks.

345
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:41,110
Some of these headsets and peripherals, it's like 800 bucks. The Rift is 400. I could buy two PS4s.

346
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:55,269
PS4 is 299. I could buy like one and a half PS4s.

347
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:18,090
Can I have your half PS4? What's going on? No, it's mine.

348
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,199
As some of you may know, I have my own gaming related injury recently.

349
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:35,989
I went for that triangle button and next thing you know, I'm on the floor hot and

350
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:46,099
2k is no joke. So once again, esports is the fastest growing sport on the planet

351
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:53,300
and still breaking records with massive multimillion dollar prize, uh, prize pools and

352
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:59,300
the award for best esports player recognizes both outstanding play regardless of the game

353
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,820
and also good sportsmanship. So here are the nominees.

354
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,969
Best esports player.

355
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,530
Your Fortnite world champion, Boogaloo.

356
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:22,780
You got a huge throat. No, I don't. My throat is normal. I have a normal throat.

357
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:37,909
Best esports. All right, I'm going to say what's the highest skill ceiling? What game has the

358
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:46,039
highest skill ceiling? And the game award for best esports player goes to Boogaloo.

359
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,340
Thank you guys so much. How do you think I can do all these powerful voices?

360
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:27,619
I have extra thick airway. My family, my friends, my team sentinels, and most importantly,

361
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:32,739
Epic Games for making any of this possible. And I'm so glad to be a part of this community

362
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:35,780
and I can't wait to see what the future holds. Thank you guys so much.

363
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:48,409
Those patrols are actually kind of cool. Ninja sitting back there going like,

364
00:54:48,409 --> 00:55:07,300
should have been. It don't really matter though, because ninja is at that spot in celebrity status

365
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,460
where you don't have to win anymore in anything. You just, you just participate in everything.

366
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:13,699
You know what I mean? Like he doesn't, it doesn't matter.

367
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:42,329
What is this? Beautiful, deadly, right in our way. That's about right.

368
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:57,139
Destiny 2. Destiny 2 again? It blends together guys. It does. It just blends together. No,

369
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:03,929
it's something else. It's, you know, it's the same like lights, the same like blue and pink,

370
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:11,780
bright, like refracting lights. I feel like, like the armor and the lights, it's the blue

371
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:18,920
neon and blue and red and green neon refracting lights. It's something about it. I don't know

372
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:25,739
what it is. It's in every game now. Oh, you noticed that. Yeah. PlayStation 5. All right.

373
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:30,059
This show is on fire. I'm here with Keith Lee, the CEO of Counterplay and Steve Gibson,

374
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:36,380
the president of Gearbox Publishing. Guys, brand new announcement, brand new IP new game.

375
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:42,699
What is Godfall? Godfall is a brand new IP set in a brand new fantasy universe

376
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:48,539
filled with heroic knights and mysterious magic. We call it a looter slasher. All right. So,

377
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:53,260
looter slasher. Tell us a bit about like, how is this going to play? So, we're here to reinvent

378
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:58,860
combat for loot driven action RPGs. We'll have third person real-time melee combat as you hunt

379
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:04,059
for awesome loot. You can also play the game in solo as well as in co-op. It's going to be

380
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:07,820
fun for everyone. Well, it looks absolutely incredible. That was all in-engine. You know,

381
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,739
you can see the game that we're going to get to play there. Steve, you know, from Gearbox's

point of view, you guys nominated tonight, obviously, Borderlands. Congrats on that.

383
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,460
Thank you. But how do you guys fit into this picture with Sony and with Counterplay?

384
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:24,780
Oh, man. You know we love our co-op and our gear at Gearbox. So, here we are, man. And when Keith

385
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:31,099
showed us Godfall, it was so amazing to us. We had to call our friends over at Sony, our friends

386
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:36,219
over at Epic, say, hey, help us make this work on your technology and your hardware. Keith,

404
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:30,889
World premieres and announcements to start off the show. And we've talked about Xbox,

405
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:35,929
we've talked about PlayStation, another platform we probably should talk about now.

406
00:59:35,929 --> 00:59:41,610
We have another world premiere, brand new game announcement that I don't think you guys are

407
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,969
expecting, but we're really excited to share with you here on the Game Awards. Check this out.

408
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:05,980
Hitman Switch. It is time to choose. Accept your fate and await oblivion.

409
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:16,340
Or make a stand and fight for survival. Step into the light, young hero. Be brave.

410
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:21,429
During the movie you can't, you can't, you can't go to the bathroom during the movie.

411
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:44,010
I like the 3D on top of 3D on top of 3D. Looks cool.

412
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:59,000
I think people probably gonna, new poll has started. What's the poll?

413
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:05,300
What poll? Who do you think should win the 2019 best play on Twitch?

414
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,940
Best play on, what was the play?

415
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:13,820
What was the play?

416
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,219
My fellow Canadian, Rebecca Ford, live operations and community director at Digital Extremes.

417
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:21,340
Is that for Canada or for Rebecca? For both of them. All right,

418
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,300
Rebecca, welcome to the Game Awards. You've been up here before. Warframe. Tell us,

419
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,579
what's the latest on Warframe?

420
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:30,860
You know, we've been making this game for seven years and each year we update it with

421
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,019
space ninja flair, but we think it's time to go space pirate and this whole

422
01:01:35,019 --> 01:01:37,820
Empyrean thing is what our community wants to know about.

423
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,019
Yes, I know you guys have teased that. What can you tell us about it?

424
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:41,820
What's gonna come out?

425
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,980
Well, we were thinking on PC.

426
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,619
What is this?

427
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:45,500
Right now.

428
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,420
Oh, okay. Here we go. So I'm here live right now. All right. That's fantastic.

429
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,739
And people will get their hands on it tonight.

430
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:53,579
Anything else that we should be keeping in mind?

431
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,739
Yeah. Our PlayStation 4 and Xbox one 10.

432
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:58,059
Oh, have the rising tide update, which means we are now

433
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:04,860
following anyone. Yes, I do. I follow Vinny. I follow Vinesauce. That's bullshit.

434
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,699
I don't follow literally anyone.

435
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:11,340
Where's my stream?

436
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:16,059
Where's my stream? All right. Who cares about my stream?

437
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,780
I am coast.

438
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:39,429
I do though.

439
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:44,230
Oh, it's because I'm not logged in to this. I'm not logged in.

440
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,230
This is just a browser plugin. Okay, I get it.

441
01:02:47,110 --> 01:03:27,980
Stop it.

442
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,679
Tonight, we're happy to welcome Samsung as a new partner of the Game Awards.

443
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,639
And throughout the night, you'll be hearing from my fellow Canadian,

444
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,880
lots of Canadians tonight, Linus Tech Tips about Samsung's QLED TVs,

445
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,159
which are optimized for the best gaming experience. Take a look.

446
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:48,380
I'm Linus from Linus Tech Tips, and I'll be talking about some of the ways living

447
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:55,420
room gaming is better than ever. When I was a kid, my first gaming TV was about this big.

448
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,659
And it had a VHS player built into it.

449
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:58,059
Me too.

450
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:03,420
Not very immersive. With a Samsung QLED TV, not only can you see more than ever before,

451
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,019
but at 4K resolution with sizes of up to 82 inches.

452
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:08,619
Linus, you're sitting too close.

453
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:09,420
Unbelievable.

454
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,300
Linus, sit back. You're going to hurt your eye.

455
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,739
You can game without worry.

456
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:14,619
That's too close.

457
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,139
See, that just hurt me. And I'm like far away. This is like a 25 inch TV.

458
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:22,699
And I play Fortnite and I'm 14.

459
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,820
Linus, you're sitting too close to the TV, man.

460
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,340
A very small following.

461
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:34,539
In the past 14 months, everything's really taken off and it's been absolutely incredible.

462
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,659
I mean, I've become the first woman in Faze Clan.

463
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:45,690
My goal is to see many more females playing and considered at an equal level.

464
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,369
And I really want to see that explode in the gaming world.

465
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:50,809
I think that would be really nice.

466
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:59,960
And he walks here with us tonight. We're so glad to have her with us.

467
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,519
All right.

468
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,119
Oh, I can vote on this one.

469
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:04,760
He's the senior art director for Magic the Gathering.

470
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,199
Dan, welcome to the Game Awards.

471
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:06,760
Thank you.

472
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,880
Probably no more Heroes 3.

473
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,320
You're our brand. What's next?

474
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,559
Well, Jeff, I'm excited to tell you that in January,

475
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:17,000
Magic will be returning to one of our most beloved worlds.

476
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,280
So the last time we went to Theros, a world of gods, myths, and monsters,

477
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,119
we saw our hero, Elspeth Tyrell, my favorite planeswalker,

478
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,800
betrayed by the gods and banished to walk the underworld.

479
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,719
But now our hero is ready to defy death and escape her fate.

480
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,480
And I'm here to give you a sneak peek at what's in store for her.

481
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,760
Now with music by Ramin Jawadi.

482
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,199
This is the trailer for Theros Beyond Death.

483
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:44,840
All right, check it out.

484
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,679
Watch this trailer. I'm going to run and pee and be right back.

485
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:42,309
This is probably why I lean into my friend.

486
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,429
I'm sitting next to the movie and go,

487
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:45,340
what happened?

488
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,860
Something fucking major happened.

489
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,619
And your friend is just sitting there going,

490
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:53,260
I, the guy with the green hat came in and there was a firefight.

491
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,579
And I don't know, I couldn't, it was fast.

492
01:07:57,579 --> 01:07:58,460
New game announcements.

493
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,659
Just keep rolling here at the Game Awards.

494
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,340
Eventually we'll get some games you already know about,

495
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,179
but let's keep going with things you haven't seen before.

496
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,460
Here's another world premiere.

497
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:25,510
Why do they do this?

498
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,979
Yes, we know it's a big movie screen.

499
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:32,250
Why do we have to pull out?

500
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:37,939
It's almost like to prove how big the screen is.

501
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:43,020
What?

502
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,060
What the fuck was that?

503
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:49,420
She's a creative director and the lead art designer from the Evil Within series.

504
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,140
Please welcome Ikumi Nakamura.

505
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,060
What was the, what was the last thing?

506
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,590
There was some dogs barking.

507
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,109
Please bear bear with my English.

508
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:12,069
Okay, good art can change over time.

509
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,510
But great art stays great.

510
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:24,699
Great art, great art sparks joy in our brains

511
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:28,539
and helps us to change the way we think.

512
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:35,340
Because sometimes we need to change to survive.

513
01:09:36,699 --> 01:09:40,859
This year I had a big change in my life

514
01:09:41,659 --> 01:09:43,979
and it's been a crazy year.

515
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:49,939
Is it Evil Within 2?

516
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,670
Evil Within 2?

517
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,949
But I'm alive.

518
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,909
Was it a crazy year for you?

519
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,979
You are not alone because I'm here.

520
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:11,529
And we have great games with great art.

521
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:17,689
But here are the nominees for Best Art Direction are...

522
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:18,890
Look at it!

523
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:23,000
Best Art Direction.

524
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,399
Best Art Direction presented by Samsung QLED.

525
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:27,800
Samsung, you didn't make any of this stuff.

526
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,300
Please.

527
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:46,970
Yeah, Sekiro was.

528
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,489
Sekiro did look pretty great.

529
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:49,689
It was pretty good.

530
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:50,189
Yeah.

531
01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:53,369
I would say it was probably Sekiro.

532
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:57,930
As you know, I am a fortune teller.

533
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:10,310
I can see, and the winner is...

534
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,109
Did you just show it?

535
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:12,489
Control!

536
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:43,479
Control is amazing.

537
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:44,199
I didn't play it.

538
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,510
This is incredible.

539
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,710
Trying to avoid any explicit language right now.

540
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,750
Instead of being Sekiro.

541
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:00,229
I think the big thank you goes to the art director,

542
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:01,670
Janne Polkinen.

543
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,510
He is an amazing person.

544
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:04,550
Was the art director not there?

545
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,310
He's worked at Remedy for a long while.

546
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:11,029
And he had this crystal clear vision of what he wanted to achieve with Control.

547
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,029
And he did amazing things together with his team.

548
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:18,229
Also I have to thank Stuart MacDonald, who is the world design director,

549
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:19,989
and Aunty Boomi who handled the characters,

550
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:22,949
and all the creepy monsters that existed in this game.

551
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:28,149
And I can't imagine a better group of artists,

552
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:30,470
intelligence, creative people to work with.

553
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,989
And this is thanks to you guys.

554
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:34,710
Thank you so much for your work.

555
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,560
Does Control look good?

556
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,100
They're...

557
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:42,439
I don't even know what Control is.

558
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,239
I know it's like you can manipulate the world with your hands

559
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,520
and you have all the superpowers, right?

560
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,359
You have all the superpowers, you can probably climb the walls.

561
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,600
Something like that.

562
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,840
Congratulations to the guys at Remedy.

563
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,199
We've got lots more words coming up.

564
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,960
But right now I'm here with Donald Mustard,

565
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,359
worldwide creative director for Epic Games.

566
01:12:58,359 --> 01:12:59,479
Donald, welcome back to the game.

567
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:00,680
It's a yearly thing, I feel like.

568
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,119
Here we go, season three Fortnite.

569
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:02,680
Here it comes.

570
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,039
Well, you guys have built quite a franchise in Fortnite.

571
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:09,720
And the last couple years have just been so crazy for you guys.

572
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,520
But what I love is that you're constantly innovating with this game.

573
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,479
That's what we're trying to know.

574
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:18,039
It's, you know, we think we're all just trying to make stuff that we think is fun,

575
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:19,319
that we think is cool.

576
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:24,359
And you never quite expect something to take off the way that Fortnite did, right?

577
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:27,880
But once that momentum happened, we're just like, man, how do we just...

578
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,920
We've got to lean in.

579
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,560
And how do we find ways to really just push the idea of what

580
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,279
a persistent virtual place can be?

581
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:37,399
And so that's why even this year...

582
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:38,439
A Marshal concert wasn't...

583
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:39,479
The concert, yeah.

584
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:42,039
We start the year off with a concert that has, you know,

585
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,960
over 10 million people in it.

586
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:48,039
You know, we roll into huge monster fights.

587
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:51,239
And we've got a thing we've been fighting forever to like,

588
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:56,520
how do we find a way to suck the entire world into the zero point black hole

589
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,920
and turn the game off and like all this stuff?

590
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
But that all in some ways, I think,

591
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,479
pales in comparison to what's about to happen this weekend.

592
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:03,979
Right.

593
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, something pretty cool is gonna happen in a few hours, you know, and on Saturday.

594
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,520
On Saturday, you guys probably have seen teasing a little bit about

595
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,159
something that's happening at Risky Reels tied to Star Wars.

596
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:17,880
Yeah.

597
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,119
If you do Fortnite VR, isn't it just gonna be like this?

598
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:21,239
Yes, and it's pretty cool.

599
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:22,279
What can you tell us about it?

600
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:23,399
Like, don't you have to like look down at it?

601
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:25,560
You know, I probably can't tell you much.

602
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,960
But I have a friend who can.

603
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,960
Okay, let's take a look.

604
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,159
How do you do Fortnite VR?

605
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:32,920
Thanks, Donald.

606
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,359
Hey, everyone, it's JJ Abrams, director of The Rise of Skywalker.

607
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:40,119
Join me in Fortnite on Saturday for an exclusive look at the movie.

608
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:41,479
To see the whole thing in the game.

609
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:44,279
So I'll see you in Fortnite on Saturday.

610
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:44,779
Thanks.

611
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:50,779
Yeah, I see you Saturday for Fortnite.

612
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,460
And I think, you know, some people online are like,

613
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,060
oh, you're just running a clip or whatever.

614
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,020
And I don't know how much you want to reveal,

615
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,100
but you and I have been talking all year about, you know,

616
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,539
building a live experience around this.

617
01:14:58,539 --> 01:15:00,619
I'm excited. I'm going to get to actually be in the game as well.

618
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:03,020
Kind of interacting with JJ.

619
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,539
And I don't know how much you want to tell us about it,

620
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:07,819
but it's going to be a live participatory experience, right?

621
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:12,220
I think it's going to be like something that no one's ever seen before, ever.

622
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,619
I mean, JJ and Jeff, we're going to be live.

623
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:19,899
Oh, and that's the glider we're going to get, I think.

624
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:20,859
There's also going to be that.

625
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:21,260
Exactly.

626
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,899
Wait, so hold on.

627
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,779
That's what happens when you do it live.

628
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,300
So you never know.

629
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,180
There's an attack happening.

630
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,380
Everyone who shows up, like as you drop out of the battle bus,

631
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,739
you're all going to pop those out.

632
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,460
Like everyone that shows up is going to get Thai whispers.

633
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:38,020
It's awesome.

634
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:42,579
You're flying around and JJ and Jeff will be there live in the game.

635
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:45,939
And we're going to see this awesome clip from Star Wars.

636
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:49,300
It's a brief, but I've seen it many times.

637
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:49,939
From Star Wars.

638
01:15:49,939 --> 01:15:50,819
Very, very good.

639
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:52,420
What clip from Star Wars?

640
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,380
And then some other crazy stuff is going to happen.

641
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,140
It's my favorite part of Star Wars.

642
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,220
It's when Han Solo said Boba Fett.

643
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,779
I'm really excited about sort of what this means, I think, for sort of

644
01:15:59,779 --> 01:16:00,739
programming inside of games.

645
01:16:00,739 --> 01:16:01,380
That's better.

646
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:01,859
Use that one.

647
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,220
Shared experiences like the Game Awards.

648
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,899
People all coming together watching this.

649
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:06,500
But this is inside the game world.

650
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,659
I'm really excited about what is going to happen on Saturday.

651
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:10,819
So right from the Game Awards to that.

652
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:15,060
But before then, I know you've got some other, some cool things that people can

653
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:15,939
pick up in Fortnite.

654
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:16,340
We do.

655
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,699
So there's one more thing.

656
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:23,939
So right now you can go to Fortnite and these are now available in the game.

657
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:25,779
And they're some of my favorite characters of all time.

658
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:28,100
Rey and Finn and the awesome new Sith Trooper.

659
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,340
And they're in the game right now.

660
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,220
You're going to get loaded up for Saturday.

661
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:33,779
Amazing.

662
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:37,779
Well, I got to say, we are really excited about what you guys have put together with

663
01:16:37,779 --> 01:16:40,899
you, Lucas and Disney, to have this come together.

664
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,380
So the Sith Troopers are just never easy to pull off.

665
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,739
Dairy Queen Cherry Dip.

666
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:45,779
I'm really excited about what it's going to be.

667
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:46,979
So Saturday.

668
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:48,899
Saturday, 2 p.m. Eastern.

669
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:49,859
And it's live.

670
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:51,300
Like we're doing it live.

671
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,460
And it's going to be amazing and crazy.

672
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,260
Just like this.

673
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,979
I was going to say, we'll be there and there'll probably be TIE fighters.

674
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,659
There'll be other crazy things going on.

675
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:01,380
Donald, thanks as always for coming by the Game Awards.

676
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:01,699
Good luck.

677
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:03,460
I know you guys are up for a bunch of awards tonight as well.

678
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,340
And we've got much more Game Awards coming up.

679
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:06,819
Thank you.

680
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:08,579
So where's the Star Wars clip?

681
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:10,020
I want to see the clip from Star Wars.

682
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,340
All right.

683
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,819
Well, we've got a lot of brand new game announcements tonight.

684
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:14,180
Where was the Star Wars clip?

685
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,899
Did they not show it?

686
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:17,619
The next one comes from a team up in my home country of Canada.

687
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:21,619
I keep mentioning Canada, but this is a game that I think you'll be surprised by.

688
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:23,939
I thought he was going to show his favorite Star Wars clip.

689
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:24,979
It's a pretty cool thing to announce at the Game Awards.

690
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:26,020
So am I stupid?

691
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,829
Yep.

692
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:52,789
I don't want to live forever.

693
01:17:52,789 --> 01:17:53,350
Demons.

694
01:18:07,699 --> 01:18:08,199
What?

695
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:38,199
Is that a demon?

696
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:07,060
Sons of the Forest.

697
01:19:09,289 --> 01:19:14,420
Sons of the Forest coming out end night tonight.

698
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,310
Sons of the Forest.

699
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,590
We got some cool stuff tonight.

700
01:19:19,909 --> 01:19:23,590
Well, one of the most played games in the world is League of Legends.

701
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:28,149
And tonight we're happy to have Riot and its new Riot Forge division with us to

702
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:32,069
reveal their first single player experience for the franchise.

703
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:33,590
What happened to the one that they were making?

704
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,149
What happened to that Monster Hunter game they were making?

705
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:38,630
Is that still going on?

706
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,350
Did they can that?

707
01:19:41,829 --> 01:19:57,829
My king, long time has come for revenge.

708
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:12,420
My master, Azmogand, away with the prey.

709
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,140
Ruin King, Airship Syndicate, I'm here with Joe Mad.

710
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,500
Joe, you guys have made some amazing games over the years.

711
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:51,060
First of all, congratulations on working with Riot to reveal you guys making the first game,

712
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:51,619
what it is.

713
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,180
Tell us more about what we just saw on that teaser.

714
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,779
How do you do single player League of Legends?

715
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:58,340
I'm so excited we can finally talk about this.

716
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,340
I was sure I would leak it before now.

717
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:04,020
But we are doing the first ever Riot Forge game.

718
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:09,220
And as you saw, it is the Ruin King, a League of Legends story.

719
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:15,779
We're basically building on our experience making Battle Chasers and Darksiders

720
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:20,180
to create a story-driven turn-based RPG.

721
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,979
We have a new take on turn-based combat that's really cool.

722
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:27,619
Obviously the visual, the art and visuals that our studio is known for.

723
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,619
And the story takes place after Burning Tides.

724
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,340
So everyone believes Gangplank is dead.

725
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,819
Bilgewater is in chaos.

726
01:21:36,819 --> 01:21:40,979
And you'll actually play as some League champions and explore Bilgewater,

727
01:21:41,619 --> 01:21:44,819
the Shadow Isles, and we have a lot of other surprises as well.

728
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:45,539
And Poros.

729
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:46,979
They're mandatory, apparently.

730
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:47,220
All right.

731
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,859
Well, it sounds like this is something you've been working on for a little while, too, right?

732
01:21:50,979 --> 01:21:51,539
We have.

733
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,739
We have, yes.

734
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:54,020
And I can't say any more.

735
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:54,500
Okay.

736
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,779
That's all you're allowed to say.

737
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:55,939
All right.

738
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,539
Well, it's so exciting to have Riot with us here at the Game Awards for the first time.

739
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:00,340
That's all I can say.

740
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:04,819
Do you like the green swooshes in that voice actor?

741
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:05,939
Well, thanks so much for announcing with us.

742
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:07,380
I really love the green swooshes.

743
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,739
I know all the League of Legends fans around the entire world who are tuned in tonight.

744
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:11,939
So, Joe, I can't wait.

745
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:12,659
I don't get this.

746
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:13,220
I don't.

747
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,140
And it's an indie-free weapon.

748
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:15,539
I will.

749
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:16,500
I'm good right now.

750
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,539
Thank you very much, Joe.

751
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:19,859
Great announcement, League of Legends.

752
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:20,340
Fantastic.

753
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:22,500
Talks over, like, 12 seconds ago.

754
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:28,100
When we come back, a performance by Grimes.

755
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:33,060
The award for best action game with Norman Reedus and a special announcement from an

756
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,859
Apex legend still to come.

757
01:22:35,859 --> 01:22:40,180
Ninja presents best multiplayer game and an extended look at Ghost of Tsushima.

758
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:42,659
This is the Game Awards.

759
01:22:42,659 --> 01:22:43,619
Don't go anywhere.

760
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,640
What is the break?

761
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:57,829
Chat, because tonight is the Game Awards.

762
01:22:57,829 --> 01:22:58,329
Hold on.

763
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:04,659
You have got to be kidding me.

764
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:05,460
Is that great?

765
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:06,020
Courage?

766
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:06,579
I said no.

767
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:07,939
Come on, Harley.

768
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:10,180
We've been here training for weeks.

769
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,020
Don't take this the wrong way or nothing.

770
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,699
Okay, that's pretty good.

771
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:14,100
Hold on.

772
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,380
That's pretty good.

773
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:16,420
But I love you.

774
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:27,029
Wait, didn't they delete this?

775
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,489
I thought that Suicide Squad was what they did.

776
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:31,130
They deleted it.

777
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,100
Something hit someone.

778
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:41,590
Tensions like violence.

779
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:59,850
Then the very end, right when it says coming 2020, you hear, ah, where is it?

780
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:00,810
What did I just save it to?

781
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:16,859
Wait, you want to, like, see what's going on on the screen.

782
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,069
Over 75 awards and nominations.

783
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:44,409
Oh, this is Doom Doom.

784
01:24:45,449 --> 01:24:54,789
A lot of stuff coming out in March, huh?

785
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:08,619
Ditch vape.

786
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:19,180
I'm vaping right now.

787
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,939
You need to cut that shit up.

788
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:22,140
Stop doing that.

789
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,739
I'm looking right in the eyes.

790
01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:24,460
Stop doing that.

791
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:27,750
What are you doing that for?

792
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,470
Don't eat a banana.

793
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,850
Just eat a banana.

794
01:25:34,409 --> 01:25:35,770
Don't do anything else.

795
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:36,729
You could eat bananas.

796
01:25:36,729 --> 01:25:37,930
You could eat banana for every meal.

797
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,489
And then smear some peanut butter.

798
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:43,609
Spoon side up just on the roof of your mouth and swallow it.

799
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:44,170
You'll be fine.

800
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:54,199
I remember that level.

801
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:55,319
That level sucked.

802
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:02,310
Back to the game awards.

803
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,710
All right.

804
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,869
Music is a big part of games.

805
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:10,390
And Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most anticipated games coming out next year.

806
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,430
You shouldn't have given me that image.

807
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:16,069
Working hard to finish the game.

808
01:26:16,069 --> 01:26:18,390
But right now, we've got a behind-the-scenes look.

809
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:21,510
I have to stop talking in mute because people will literally scream at me if they...

810
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:29,239
Even in the dystopian future, hard rap lives on.

811
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,960
We want to provide you with the soundtrack to fucking shit up.

812
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,479
I mean, we're not here as refuse.

813
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:36,520
We're here as samurai.

814
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,920
It's a very interesting thing to be part of.

815
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,119
We really work on these songs, trying to make them as good as possible.

816
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:46,119
I think my music fits with my city because both are scary and pretty at the same time.

817
01:26:47,079 --> 01:26:50,439
My music will be featured in Cyberpunk 2077.

818
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:51,399
I'm super excited.

819
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,960
It's quite rebellious and it's quite noisy and aggressive.

820
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,319
I think industrial is the word.

821
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,640
I can't wait to see how the two worlds actually meet.

822
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,800
I mean, it's been a lot of fun playing these beats.

823
01:27:04,359 --> 01:27:06,520
It's very punk rock in a way in its approach.

824
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,199
They're building these systems to make really rough, edgy music.

825
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:14,039
Psychedelic, trippy, yet plifting and engaging.

826
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,680
And you can see a lot of kind of industrial stuff and revolution happening.

827
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,159
Sort of mixing punk music and like what electronic music could be in the future.

828
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,960
So we have some tracks that are super dirty, super heavy.

829
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,600
And then we have some tracks that are very beautiful and ambient.

830
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,199
That was just a glimpse of what we have in store for you.

831
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:33,079
See you in Night City.

832
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:42,500
I promise I won't do it again.

833
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,140
Oh, I gotta say it.

834
01:27:44,100 --> 01:28:20,979
I'm deleting it off my OBS.

835
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:59,670
Oh, it's Cyberpunk.

836
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:01,689
Right.

837
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:14,180
Wait, you're doing the Wolverine?

838
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,619
Are you gonna get in and do Wolverine?

839
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:16,979
This is how Wolverine was created.

840
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,220
Don't do it.

841
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:19,699
Don't do it.

842
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:30,979
X.

843
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:35,050
Into the Faith Coffin.

844
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,180
Into the Faith Coffin.

845
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:46,939
This is the future of Cyberpunk 2020.

846
01:29:47,659 --> 01:29:51,180
You put on your gamer headset and your gamer glasses and your VR

847
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,260
and you lie down in a fucking fake chamber.

848
01:29:54,220 --> 01:30:00,180
And you have an IV of like gamer fuel and Doritos and shit.

849
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:10,859
I love it.

850
01:30:10,859 --> 01:30:12,060
I'd love that.

851
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,180
I'd love the Vape Coffin.

852
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:22,760
And every time you sneeze, blood fucking shoots out of your nose.

853
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,199
And that's what it's gonna be like.

854
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:25,640
People are like, oh, the future.

855
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,600
It's gonna be so interesting.

856
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,399
No, no, no.

857
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:29,479
Every sneeze blood's gonna spray.

858
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:31,640
Blood spray out of your nose every time in the future.

859
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,850
Shut up.

860
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,529
I'm trying to hear the subcar music.

861
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:46,149
Why is he standing?

862
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,149
Why is he standing?

863
01:30:48,149 --> 01:30:49,029
What is going on?

864
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,560
The camera's on me.

865
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,920
And now, he's the star of The Walking Dead and the best performance nominee tonight for his

866
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:01,640
role as Sam Porter Bridges in Death Stranding.

867
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,800
He was so torn.

868
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,760
He was like, do I stand?

869
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,960
I don't know why would I be standing?

870
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,760
I guess I'll stand.

871
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:08,859
Hello.

872
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,220
He did that thing.

873
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,100
He did that face.

874
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:12,600
Hi.

875
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:13,539
All right.

876
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:16,420
It's time to present the award for best action game.

877
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:20,180
These games are all wildly, wildly different.

878
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:25,220
Some new franchises, some beloved sequels, all with their own unique adversaries and

879
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:25,859
objectives.

880
01:31:26,659 --> 01:31:31,859
But the one thing that they have in common is that they set the bar for lively combat

881
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:32,579
and thrills.

882
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:33,859
All right.

883
01:31:33,859 --> 01:31:34,359
Ready?

884
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,050
All right, all right, all right.

885
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:37,930
Here's the nominees.

886
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,460
But that's, that's, that's like hair game.

887
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,579
No, those, that's hair goals.

888
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:42,979
You're right.

889
01:31:42,979 --> 01:31:43,479
Keep up.

890
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,970
How am I doing?

891
01:31:47,829 --> 01:31:55,529
Kick some ass.

892
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:58,970
Jeremy, you didn't play this game.

893
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,210
Yeah, you didn't play that.

894
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:01,710
All right.

895
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:13,189
This is heavy.

896
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:16,630
And the winner is Devil May Cry 5.

897
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,109
All right.

898
01:32:17,109 --> 01:32:21,210
That's actually, that was good one.

899
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,210
That was, that was the best one on that list.

900
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,289
Boomer May Cry.

901
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:40,010
You're being snubbed.

902
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:41,210
I didn't play this game.

903
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:44,619
I didn't play the game.

904
01:32:44,619 --> 01:32:45,340
I know it was good.

905
01:32:48,859 --> 01:33:02,119
Thank you so much for all the fans who've been supporting us.

906
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:05,640
And thank you so much for waiting 11 years for the sequel.

907
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:19,779
I was really happy to stick with my roots and try to make as pure of an action game as possible.

908
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,000
Say no.

909
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,840
DMC is back.

910
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:25,340
Thank you.

911
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,500
Yeah, it's uh, I, I, I can say that again.

912
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:37,100
Congrats to DMC guys.

913
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:37,340
All right.

914
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:42,619
I'm now joined by Jeff Hadam, the studio lead and founder of two games from Canada.

915
01:33:42,619 --> 01:33:45,819
I don't know how it all works out that way, but a lot of cat crimes, Canadian, Jeff.

916
01:33:45,819 --> 01:33:46,060
All right.

917
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,539
Anyways, uh, tell us what you're working on up at two.

918
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:49,180
Thanks, Jeff.

919
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:51,899
I'm super excited to be here with the world, the air of the game.

920
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,659
We've been working on up in Montreal.

921
01:33:53,659 --> 01:33:54,460
Salut tout le monde.

922
01:33:55,020 --> 01:34:00,460
Um, when we started working on this game, we, we had the idea to put action back in action

923
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:07,180
RPG and what better place than in dungeons and dragons, forgotten realms, less action.

924
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,500
Am I fucking crazy together with your friends?

925
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,420
I want less action in my action RPGs.

926
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,020
Too much shit happens on this one.

927
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,140
Dark Alliance.

928
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:15,819
Check it out.

929
01:34:15,819 --> 01:34:18,300
I don't, I don't want like a bunch of shit on the screen.

930
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,020
A bunch of explosions in action every second.

931
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,539
I like it when it's slowed down a little.

932
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:25,449
I don't want more action.

933
01:34:25,449 --> 01:34:26,489
I want less action.

934
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:42,180
Why do they have the like fear factor cameras when they're in the haunted house?

935
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,000
I'm going to put the action back in action RPG.

936
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,640
We're also going to put the camera somewhere else too.

937
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,079
We want the, we want you to be right up in their faces, right in the action, right in their face.

938
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:23,880
All right.

939
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:27,159
Up next is the award for the absolute best.

940
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:33,960
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

941
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,000
Wow.

942
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,039
It's a little pitchy on that one.

943
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:36,920
I should keep practicing.

944
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,119
Looks like it's mirage.

945
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:40,520
Everybody.

946
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,840
What's up?

947
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,720
Mirage suction.

948
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:44,199
Hey, Keely, my man, what's going on?

949
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:46,520
Well, we're kind of in the middle of the game awards right now.

950
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,439
But this guy like attached to walls.

951
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:49,479
Oh, is that tonight?

952
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:50,439
Tell me, tell me.

953
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:54,600
Did they already win for best all around competitor in a battle royale based on skills?

954
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,039
But mostly good looks.

955
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,680
That is such a specific award.

956
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:02,439
And as I told you on Twitter, I'm sorry.

957
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:03,560
Oh, okay.

958
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:03,880
Okay.

959
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,840
I see what you're doing.

960
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,760
Keeping the mystery alive for the audience.

961
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,239
I get it.

962
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:08,600
It's a secret award.

963
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,399
I get later.

964
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:11,000
Wink.

965
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,159
It's not like I haven't been practicing my acceptance speech.

966
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,600
Wow.

967
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,560
These things are really heavy.

968
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:19,800
I'd like to thank my mother for my exceptional good looks.

969
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,239
Mirage, we have a show.

970
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:22,840
We've got lots of announcements to get to.

971
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:25,159
Is there a purpose of today's call?

972
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:25,720
Oh, right.

973
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:30,520
Well, I know everybody's always asking for more Mirage content because obviously.

974
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:34,199
And I think I speak for everyone when I say we've all had enough of crypto.

975
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,079
So Keely, I'm here tonight to just give the people what they want.

976
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:40,840
Oh, a decentralized way to have a mutual credit system.

977
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,960
I'm a captain.

978
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,640
The captain of what exactly?

979
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,039
The Mirage Voyage.

980
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:50,760
Oh, yeah.

981
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,319
It's my big holo day bash.

982
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:53,800
You get it?

983
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,159
Holo days because the and I do holograms.

984
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:59,319
And anyway, can I put you down for a plus one?

985
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:00,840
Fine.

986
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:03,640
Oh, that's the best.

987
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,279
What game is this?

988
01:37:04,279 --> 01:37:07,640
This party starts right now.

989
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,060
Oh, I see.

990
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,420
They really they tap it into the court.

991
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,380
And I've got presents for everyone at the awards.

992
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,460
And all you beautiful people watching at home.

993
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:24,100
Join me at the party and you all get this free.

994
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:24,739
Makes sense.

995
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:29,060
Exclusive legendary skin of my matching G7.

996
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:29,779
Sexy, huh?

997
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,100
And the gun doesn't look bad either.

998
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,939
Yeah, extremely generous of you, Mirage.

999
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:36,420
Thank you for that.

1000
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,779
What can I say, Jeff?

1001
01:37:37,779 --> 01:37:39,140
I am a giver.

1002
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:40,180
All right.

1003
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,060
Well, listen up.

1004
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:44,579
We do have a show to get back to.

1005
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:45,460
So thanks, Mirage.

1006
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:45,939
OK.

1007
01:37:45,939 --> 01:37:46,659
OK, best buddy.

1008
01:37:46,659 --> 01:37:49,619
Can't wait to see you and everybody else at the biggest

1009
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:51,619
celebration in the outlands.

1010
01:37:51,619 --> 01:37:52,739
It's party time.

1011
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,979
This is a big holiday update.

1012
01:38:11,859 --> 01:38:17,340
You'll warm up in the respawn chamber quicker than you think.

1013
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,819
I enjoy the winter months.

1014
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:33,210
Is he gonna fart on him?

1015
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:33,770
What was that?

1016
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:39,510
What was that?

1017
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,340
Let's do this.

1018
01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:47,619
Hog train?

1019
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,439
Things called the hog train?

1020
01:39:05,029 --> 01:39:06,069
Why are you looking at me that way?

1021
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:25,300
Up next, Dr. Bunsen, Honeydew and Beaker present games for impact.

1022
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:26,899
Oh, yes.

1023
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:28,899
Reggie is here and he is ready.

1024
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:30,659
Oh, that's gonna be great.

1025
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,539
We're getting a Bunsen and Beaker presentation.

1026
01:39:33,539 --> 01:39:34,500
The Game Awards.

1027
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:39,930
We're getting a Muppets present.

1028
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:40,489
All right.

1029
01:39:40,489 --> 01:39:41,529
I'm gonna be quiet for this one.

1030
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:49,079
Is this in Fortnite?

1031
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,520
Adding every sport to Fortnite?

1032
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:02,869
Sport night.

1033
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:16,710
Yeah, no, we really decided we wanted to add a full 9v9 baseball.

1034
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:29,689
There you go.

1035
01:40:29,689 --> 01:40:31,850
Apple Arcade at the Game Awards for the first time.

1036
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:32,890
Ultimate Rivals.

1037
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:33,130
All right.

1038
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:35,529
We have so much more show coming up.

1039
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:39,529
I don't like that service because I bought it.

1040
01:40:39,529 --> 01:40:43,289
And there's only, okay, this is gonna sound withered and fucked up and pretentious and shitty.

1041
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:45,850
I can't talk because we have...

1042
01:40:46,970 --> 01:41:16,899
Holy shit, they added Ori and the Blind Forest to Fortnite.

1043
01:41:16,899 --> 01:41:17,460
That's pretty cool.

1044
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:20,699
How many players are on each map?

1045
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:45,079
Play it with Xbox Game Pass.

1046
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:51,899
My favorite thing about being a game designer is I didn't have to pick one subject to specialize in.

1047
01:41:53,659 --> 01:41:59,659
I'm able to just follow my interests and spend lots of time studying galactic evolution

1048
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:03,340
or urban planning or psychology, whatever it is.

1049
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:07,659
And then I just kind of turn that into a toy, into a game.

1050
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:11,340
Part of my job is just enjoying exploring the world

1051
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,739
and letting my interest take me wherever they go.

1052
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:15,899
And there are not too many jobs that I think let you do that.

1053
01:42:16,939 --> 01:42:18,859
This is like a...

1054
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,539
When it comes to upping your competition...

1055
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:23,899
This is a Gary Larson comic.

1056
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:26,859
Warframes per second makes a measurable difference.

1057
01:42:26,859 --> 01:42:27,500
Trust me.

1058
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,979
That's why Samsung's latest QLED TVs feature native support for games,

1059
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:36,380
running it up to 120 frames per second with very low input lag

1060
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:39,659
and this sweet auto game mode that detects when you're gaming

1061
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:42,460
and turns off any extra image processing.

1062
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:46,619
They've even got AMD FreeSync for smoother animations when the frame rate dips.

1063
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:47,819
Edit it onto the screen.

1064
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:53,670
The war had just started when I arrived to Iraq.

1065
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:54,470
We did our thing.

1066
01:42:55,029 --> 01:42:56,550
We had some experiences.

1067
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:58,789
And when we came back, when we got off that plane,

1068
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,670
before we can even embrace our loved ones,

1069
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:03,829
our fire team leader says,

1070
01:43:03,829 --> 01:43:05,829
do not tell anybody what happened to you

1071
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:09,109
or what you saw or what you experienced.

1072
01:43:09,909 --> 01:43:13,590
That starts the stigma of mental health.

1073
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:19,670
StackUp is a military charity supporting US and allied veterans' mental health and gaming.

1074
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:24,470
Overwatch is our newest program and it is simply having a chat client up.

1075
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:28,789
Somebody comes in and says they need to talk or they're interested to get into a game.

1076
01:43:28,789 --> 01:43:30,229
We have somebody available for them.

1077
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:37,989
They may not want to come out there and see a counselor for an hour once a week,

1078
01:43:37,989 --> 01:43:40,470
but they may come out there and play a video game

1079
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:43,590
and start talking about their experiences of war

1080
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:46,069
or the struggles that they're having right now.

1081
01:43:46,869 --> 01:43:50,310
It has become my passion to end the stigma of mental health.

1082
01:43:51,270 --> 01:44:00,390
Please welcome two of the most innovative visionaries in the history of gaming.

1083
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,270
I can't wait to see this one.

1084
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:03,109
And just about everything else.

1085
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:06,710
From Muppet Labs, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker.

1086
01:44:07,829 --> 01:44:08,550
How are we?

1087
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,390
Oh, we are eight on each other's TVs.

1088
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:11,189
Thank you.

1089
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:13,430
Greetings, fellow gaming enthusiasts.

1090
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,229
It's great to be here at the Game Awards.

1091
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:19,750
I am Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant Beaker.

1092
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:22,869
Beaky, where did you go?

1093
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:27,529
Oh, I guess he's stuck in the lobby.

1094
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,489
Nothing?

1095
01:44:32,489 --> 01:44:36,810
In just a few moments, we will reveal the winner of Games for Impact.

1096
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,649
But first, I was hoping to...

1097
01:44:38,649 --> 01:44:40,250
Oh, here's Beaky now.

1098
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,130
He's in VR.

1099
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:42,970
Good to see you.

1100
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:47,350
I forgot we have a basement.

1101
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:51,989
Beaky, I'm so glad you're here wearing VR goggles

1102
01:44:51,989 --> 01:44:54,149
to demonstrate our brand new game.

1103
01:44:55,989 --> 01:45:00,710
Yes, as you can see, Beaker is wearing Muppet Labs proprietary

1104
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:04,949
next generation technology, VR super gluey goggles.

1105
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:08,630
You can put them on, but you can't get them off.

1106
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:18,140
And now we will premiere the exciting new Muppet Labs game.

1107
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,619
Oh, Beaker, that's not funny.

1108
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:21,420
That's terrifying.

1109
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,020
What are we calling it?

1110
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:30,279
Of course, the Untitled Beaker game.

1111
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,000
Excellent choice.

1112
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,039
Let the game begin.

1113
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,640
Let's play this.

1114
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:12,659
Where does Norman Reed us off the thing?

1115
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:20,420
Here are the nominees for Games for Impact,

1116
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,579
recognizing socially conscious and progressive games in the industry.

1117
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,340
Roll the nominees.

1118
01:46:26,659 --> 01:46:27,859
Games for Impact.

1119
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:33,180
Me to hate this whole town.

1120
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:52,340
Why is it so dark?

1121
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,699
I find Life is Strange.

1122
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:58,699
Life is Strange 2 has like magic in it.

1123
01:46:58,699 --> 01:47:00,300
And the winner is...

1124
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:01,100
Wait, that's it, don't...

1125
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:05,060
What are you doing outside the game?

1126
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,500
You just please, hey, hey, give that back to me.

1127
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,260
Beaker, get him, get him, Beaker.

1128
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,460
Oh, no, that's me, that's me, Beaker.

1129
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,300
Where did he go?

1130
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,260
Where did he go?

1131
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:16,819
Where did he go?

1132
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:18,340
Where is he?

1133
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:19,939
Get him, he's behind you.

1134
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:25,050
There.

1135
01:47:25,989 --> 01:47:27,029
You've got him under control?

1136
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:28,789
All right.

1137
01:47:28,789 --> 01:47:29,590
Okay, okay.

1138
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:31,029
Thank you, Beaker.

1139
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,859
I don't care if I'm a two-year-old.

1140
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:35,819
This is cute.

1141
01:47:35,819 --> 01:47:36,699
Hold his beak sharp.

1142
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:39,180
Hold his beak, Beaker, that's it.

1143
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,300
Get him, get him.

1144
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:40,800
Good.

1145
01:47:41,659 --> 01:47:42,699
Sorry about that, folks.

1146
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,260
The award for Games for...

1147
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:48,979
Would you...

1148
01:47:48,979 --> 01:47:50,279
Have you got it?

1149
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:51,640
Fight his nose, fight his nose.

1150
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,399
Fight his nose.

1151
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:55,550
Stop it.

1152
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,340
All right.

1153
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:01,899
The award for Games for Impact goes to...

1154
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,600
No, not...

1155
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,100
He's...

1156
01:48:06,039 --> 01:48:06,539
Breeze.

1157
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:16,520
I really wanted this, really.

1158
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:20,119
I wanted to start fighting Beaker's like, neck and face and shit.

1159
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:25,720
I hope...

1160
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:27,460
Wonderful.

1161
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,140
It's gonna honk, thank you, it's gonna honk.

1162
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:30,020
Thank you to the Muppets.

1163
01:48:34,489 --> 01:48:39,930
I shared this award with, first of all, Conrad, our creative director,

1164
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,770
with all the team back at home.

1165
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:44,890
We made a really good team and we could have never made it without them.

1166
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,409
We have to thank Devolver for allowing us to do the game we wanted to make.

1167
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:52,010
Yes, well, first of all, I mean, I would like to thank,

1168
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:55,050
especially to all those people that share their stories with us.

1169
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:58,569
They send really, really moving stories when they were playing Greece.

1170
01:48:58,569 --> 01:49:00,489
That's something that, obviously, when you create a game,

1171
01:49:00,489 --> 01:49:04,010
you try to do these kind of things, but you never know if you're gonna get to someone.

1172
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:07,850
And we, pretty much, are so moved when we receive this story.

1173
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,489
So, please keep sharing it with us because it's amazing.

1174
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:12,329
And thank you, everybody, that play and support Breeze.

1175
01:49:12,329 --> 01:49:12,970
Thank you very much.

1176
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:25,979
Thanks to Bunsen and Beaker.

1177
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:28,140
Lifelong dream to have them here at the show.

1178
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,779
That was a good bit.

1179
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:29,899
I like that.

1180
01:49:29,899 --> 01:49:31,819
I also want to mention something called the Game Festival.

1181
01:49:31,819 --> 01:49:33,020
I don't know if you heard about that online,

1182
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:35,579
but we're launching a new thing tied to the game where it's called the Game Festival.

1183
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:39,340
And the vision for that is to give all of you around the world who watch the show,

1184
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:42,539
you watch trailers, you love games, a chance to play a bunch of games.

1185
01:49:42,539 --> 01:49:44,539
And this year, we're partnering with Steam.

1186
01:49:44,539 --> 01:49:46,619
And if you head to Steam for the next 48 hours,

1187
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:48,300
a little bit less than that since it started this morning,

1188
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:53,500
we have first look demos of over a dozen upcoming games that you can play for free on Steam.

1189
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,340
And I think that's kind of the future where this all goes.

1190
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,060
Bringing demos back?

1191
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:58,939
Not necessarily these local events where you have to travel somewhere to play a game,

1192
01:49:58,939 --> 01:50:04,220
but actually bringing games into your homes and the places you work and live to play.

1193
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:05,500
So, play all those games.

1194
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,539
The Game Festival concludes Saturday at 10 a.m. Pacific.

1195
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:10,060
And next year, we're going to do it across all the platforms.

1196
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:11,340
I don't know why they went away in the first place.

1197
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:11,899
A big thing.

1198
01:50:11,899 --> 01:50:13,420
So, we're looking forward to doing more with that.

1199
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:14,380
All right.

1200
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:16,859
Well, now we're going to present some more awards.

1201
01:50:16,859 --> 01:50:19,340
And let's get into the best family game.

1202
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:22,939
The nominees for that category are Luigi's Mansion 3,

1203
01:50:23,979 --> 01:50:28,220
Ring Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1204
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:29,819
They're all Nintendo games.

1205
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,939
And Yoshi's Crafted World.

1206
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:34,619
It's just best Nintendo game.

1207
01:50:34,619 --> 01:50:35,899
Kind of like Nintendo's chances in this category.

1208
01:50:36,859 --> 01:50:40,779
And the game award goes to Luigi's Mansion 3.

1209
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:42,060
Why even have this category?

1210
01:50:42,779 --> 01:50:47,739
Why don't you just have an ad up here that just says buy Nintendo games for families?

1211
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,100
Just have a Nintendo ad.

1212
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:01,739
Have to close my eyes.

1213
01:51:02,539 --> 01:51:08,060
And the game award goes to FIFA 1 Crash Team Racing Nitrofuel.

1214
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:17,130
And for the best mobile game, the nominees are Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone,

1215
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:23,050
Sayonara Wild Hearts, which we announced last year, Sky, Children of the Light, and What the Golf.

1216
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:28,329
And the game award in that category goes to Call of Duty Mobile.

1217
01:51:28,329 --> 01:51:29,449
Congratulations, guys.

1218
01:51:31,529 --> 01:51:32,090
All right.

1219
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:36,649
Well, now I'd like to welcome the co-creators of Dishonored and Prey.

1220
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:37,850
Raph and Julian are here.

1221
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:41,050
You may have seen online that they've just announced their brand new studio.

1222
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:42,890
Wolfi and Seth here at the Game Awards.

1223
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:45,130
They're going to reveal their first game.

1224
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:46,649
So guys, welcome to the Game Awards.

1225
01:51:46,649 --> 01:51:48,810
You've been here before, but you've got this new studio.

1226
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:50,810
So tell me a bit about Wolfi.

1227
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:51,770
What's different about it?

1228
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:56,329
So, well, we took a long break, but it looks like we can't stay away from making a game for very long.

1229
01:51:56,329 --> 01:51:58,010
So we're just back at it now with Wolfi.

1230
01:51:58,649 --> 01:51:59,210
Yeah.

1231
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:00,890
Well, what can you tell us about the game?

1232
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:01,609
We know the studio.

1233
01:52:01,609 --> 01:52:03,689
We don't know anything about the game, but that's going to change now, right?

1234
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:04,090
Yeah.

1235
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:08,090
So you've mentioned Dishonored and Prey as some of our past games.

1236
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:12,409
We have passion for interesting worlds to explore.

1237
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:15,369
We have passion for depth of interactivity.

1238
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:18,729
And of course, we have passion for simulation in general.

1239
01:52:18,729 --> 01:52:21,369
So this new game has all of these values.

1240
01:52:21,369 --> 01:52:23,770
But this time, we have a bit of a different approach.

1241
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:28,810
We brought a glimpse to show you through a teaser.

1242
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:29,930
I'm pretending.

1243
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:30,810
It's amazing.

1244
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:32,329
One of my favorite programs to show tonight.

1245
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:33,369
That was pretty incredible.

1246
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:35,210
You're going to see the real game here, guys.

1247
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:36,409
We can't wait to hear more about this.

1248
01:52:36,409 --> 01:52:37,289
Let's take a look.

1249
01:52:37,289 --> 01:52:37,850
What do you do?

1250
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,369
First look at the first project.

1251
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:39,850
Nice.

1252
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:41,609
I was pretending.

1253
01:52:41,609 --> 01:52:42,649
That was, you can call me out on that.

1254
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:56,069
The West, the land of opportunity.

1255
01:52:57,850 --> 01:53:04,729
A place where you can be a hero, a scoundrel, and anything in between.

1256
01:53:06,949 --> 01:53:09,430
This ain't quite the Wild West as you know it.

1257
01:53:10,729 --> 01:53:13,289
There are ancient powers that war with each other.

1258
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:18,649
Strange entities lurking in the dead of night with their own rules

1259
01:53:18,649 --> 01:53:21,050
and their own peculiar motives.

1260
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:25,369
Welcome to the weird West.

1261
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:28,250
Weird West.

1262
01:53:39,079 --> 01:53:39,960
Wacky West.

1263
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:58,520
All right, action.

1264
01:53:58,520 --> 01:53:59,159
Action RPG.

1265
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:02,199
The only out here could be the best thing that ever happened to you.

1266
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,079
If you can survive, that is.

1267
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:08,920
What's with the on the phone late at night?

1268
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,079
Talking that that was.

1269
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:16,359
All right, up next, a brand new MMO action RPG game from a legendary franchise.

1270
01:54:16,359 --> 01:54:17,319
Check out this announcement.

1271
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:56,550
Firefists.

1272
01:54:58,710 --> 01:54:59,689
Spiders.

1273
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:01,659
What else?

1274
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:20,920
Magic Legends.

1275
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:26,229
Magic, Firefox?

1276
01:55:26,949 --> 01:55:27,590
What was that?

1277
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:28,550
Magic Legends.

1278
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:33,109
Coming up, the first look at a brand new game from an exciting new studio.

1279
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:36,710
And Ninja is here to hand out the award for best multiplayer game.

1280
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:41,270
And still to come, more premieres, more awards,

1281
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:47,029
an extended preview from Ghost of Tsushima and Green Day performs live.

1282
01:55:47,029 --> 01:55:49,189
The game awards will be right back.

1283
01:55:49,189 --> 01:55:50,550
I want the Muppets to come back.

1284
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:54,390
Can the Muppets just present every award?

1285
01:55:55,829 --> 01:56:00,489
Hi, I'm looking for...

1286
01:56:00,489 --> 01:56:01,050
Stadia?

1287
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:02,739
What?

1288
01:56:02,739 --> 01:56:03,539
What's Stadia?

1289
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:09,460
Stadia is only the newest, most logic-defined, mind-bending, absurd gaming platform on Earth.

1290
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:13,539
I'll take conversations that will never happen for 100 plays.

1291
01:56:15,539 --> 01:56:18,979
And this electric air is Stadia.

1292
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:22,739
Unlike console, Stadia doesn't take up any space.

1293
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:25,909
It makes no noise.

1294
01:56:25,909 --> 01:56:27,189
It has no smell.

1295
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,750
Watch.

1296
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,869
Go find Stadia, boy.

1297
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:30,069
Don't worry.

1298
01:56:30,789 --> 01:56:32,710
You'll never find it.

1299
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:33,270
Okay.

1300
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,270
You can play Stadia with this.

1301
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:44,340
What games are on there?

1302
01:56:45,699 --> 01:56:50,010
With Stadia, you can go virtually anywhere.

1303
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:56,649
Unless you want to play Tomb Raider or NBA 2K18.

1304
01:56:56,649 --> 01:56:59,930
Stadia is gaming for free-range humans.

1305
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:02,890
Stadia travels across screens.

1306
01:57:04,649 --> 01:57:06,039
No downloads.

1307
01:57:06,039 --> 01:57:07,000
No updates.

1308
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:07,720
No waiting.

1309
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:10,680
Stadia bends time and space to take you straight to your game.

1310
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,720
So, Stadia is the platform.

1311
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,880
Technically, this is Stadia.

1312
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,000
Stadia's streaming pipeline leverages decades of Google research.

1313
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:19,560
Is that a dog?

1314
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,659
He actually found it.

1315
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:28,380
But so does every other platform.

1316
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:29,579
It doesn't matter.

1317
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:33,100
As I don't get, Stadia has the games you're looking for.

1318
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:34,140
So does PlayStation 4.

1319
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:36,220
So does PlayStation 5, Xbox, PC.

1320
01:57:38,539 --> 01:57:43,420
I can download a game on Switch and it won't have like 0.4 seconds of input delay.

1321
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,300
I don't understand why this is here.

1322
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:50,539
And I actually have a theory that the Stadia, they know that it's not good enough.

1323
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:56,619
But in 10 years, maybe the internet will get to a point where they'll be the first movers

1324
01:57:56,619 --> 01:57:58,220
when everything is like 7G.

1325
01:57:58,220 --> 01:57:58,939
They'll be here.

1326
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:05,420
That's a 10-year play.

1327
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:06,140
But I don't like that.

1328
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,140
PUBG Mobile?

1329
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:38,300
Why not just PUBG?

1330
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,140
PUBG Mobile only.

1331
01:58:50,779 --> 01:58:51,899
Fight for the Amazon.

1332
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:07,210
Oh, by the way, I played Luigi's Mansion for like an hour or two.

1333
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:08,649
I could never play that game for more.

1334
01:59:08,649 --> 01:59:09,210
I can't do it.

1335
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,170
I can't play it.

1336
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:12,170
I will never play Luigi's Mansion for more.

1337
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,250
And I really don't talk about this.

1338
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,289
I'll try to go as quick as I can.

1339
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:20,039
Luigi's Mansion 3.

1340
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:22,840
The vacuum cleaner mechanic.

1341
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,439
I have to suck up everything.

1342
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:28,359
I cannot leave a single room unless every single fucking object is in that vacuum.

1343
01:59:29,239 --> 01:59:30,199
I can't play the game.

1344
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,170
It takes me hours.

1345
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:40,409
I played the game for probably two and a half hours.

1346
01:59:41,449 --> 01:59:43,529
And I got through maybe the first five rooms.

1347
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:50,649
Fitness or just taking control of their health in general.

1348
01:59:50,649 --> 01:59:53,210
And if one of your goals is to quit vaping,

1349
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:54,569
Truth has a program that can help.

1350
01:59:54,569 --> 01:59:55,930
It's called This Is Quitting.

1351
01:59:55,930 --> 02:00:00,170
It's free, anonymous, text-based, available any time of day right on your phone.

1352
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:02,090
And it's already helping as thousands of people quit.

1353
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:04,649
All you have to do is text DITCHJUEL to 888-799.

1354
02:00:04,649 --> 02:00:05,850
And then it texts you.

1355
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:07,529
It texts you to stop.

1356
02:00:07,529 --> 02:00:08,970
But you don't have to do it alone.

1357
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:11,670
Visit the Truth information and enjoy the game of words.

1358
02:00:18,329 --> 02:00:19,130
Vape coffin.

1359
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:22,329
All right, now here's a brand new game announcement from Oculus Studios.

1360
02:00:22,329 --> 02:00:22,810
Check it out.

1361
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:25,930
Hey, it's Jeremy here with the vape coffin.

1362
02:00:54,359 --> 02:00:57,319
I feel like the bar fighting game was like a better version of that somehow.

1363
02:00:57,319 --> 02:00:59,640
...is one of the most watched streamers alive

1364
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:03,399
and the winner of last year's game award for content creator of the year.

1365
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:05,109
Please welcome Ninja.

1366
02:01:07,579 --> 02:01:08,220
What's this for?

1367
02:01:08,779 --> 02:01:09,340
What's this for?

1368
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:14,539
Thank you guys so much for obviously being here.

1369
02:01:14,539 --> 02:01:16,619
I've been playing video games my entire life.

1370
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,979
And there's something magical about a solo player experience.

1371
02:01:20,619 --> 02:01:21,979
And the only way to enhance that

1372
02:01:22,619 --> 02:01:24,140
is to play games with your friends.

1373
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:28,859
I've literally defined my entire career by playing online multiplayer games.

1374
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,220
And here are the nominees for the best multiplayer game of the year.

1375
02:01:58,810 --> 02:02:02,500
If you did like the Coke and Pepsi test with me

1376
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,579
and you put me in half of those games on this list,

1377
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:06,979
blindfold and just put me in.

1378
02:02:06,979 --> 02:02:09,060
I don't know if I'd be able to tell you what one I was playing.

1379
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:11,699
The game award for best multiplayer game goes to

1380
02:02:12,739 --> 02:02:15,689
it's a lot more difficult to open up than you think.

1381
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:18,520
Apex Legends.

1382
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,909
Tetris.

1383
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:23,510
All right, blindfold me.

1384
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:24,470
Let's see.

1385
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,109
I don't know.

1386
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:27,029
I could be in a this is like a VR.

1387
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:36,680
Tetris lost.

1388
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,470
Wow.

1389
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:42,550
But Tetris is also like 60 years old.

1390
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:45,029
The last four years has been transformative for Respawn.

1391
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:47,829
They didn't have game awards when Tetris came out.

1392
02:02:47,829 --> 02:02:49,189
That's the real sad part.

1393
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:51,829
They should do a retroactive game award.

1394
02:02:51,829 --> 02:02:53,109
Thank you to the fans.

1395
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:53,989
Thank you so much.

1396
02:02:55,350 --> 02:03:00,260
I'd just like to thank the team at Respawn of crazy, passionate,

1397
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:04,180
super talented individuals for going with us on this crazy journey.

1398
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:05,539
We changed our genre.

1399
02:03:05,539 --> 02:03:06,819
We changed our business model.

1400
02:03:06,819 --> 02:03:09,859
We made our first character based game and we changed IPs

1401
02:03:09,859 --> 02:03:11,939
while we were shipping a AAA shooter.

1402
02:03:11,939 --> 02:03:13,060
So thank you.

1403
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:13,939
I love you guys.

1404
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:27,779
At the end of that, all he had to do was go like this.

1405
02:03:27,779 --> 02:03:29,300
Congratulations to Respawn.

1406
02:03:29,939 --> 02:03:32,819
Great to see Apex winning best multiplayer game now.

1407
02:03:32,819 --> 02:03:35,539
This year, TikTok has swept the nation with its hashtag challenges.

1408
02:03:35,539 --> 02:03:36,100
No, no, no.

1409
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:39,220
The past few weeks, fans have been celebrating gaming on TikTok

1410
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:43,699
with over 450 million views so far.

1411
02:03:43,699 --> 02:03:47,220
Tonight, you can use the hashtag to join the celebration of gaming

1412
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:49,619
and esports biggest night in the contest.

1413
02:03:49,619 --> 02:03:51,060
Cheesy C64.

1414
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:52,899
He's the guy that wanted right there.

1415
02:03:52,899 --> 02:03:54,579
So congratulations to him.

1416
02:03:54,579 --> 02:03:55,380
All right.

1417
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:57,619
We've got so much more game awards coming up.

1418
02:03:57,699 --> 02:04:00,100
The gaming on TikTok contest will continue for the next few days.

1419
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,300
Cheesy C64.

1420
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:04,340
The next Twitch poll is open for best ongoing game.

1421
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:07,140
You can go vote now and we'll see who you think is going to take home

1422
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:09,220
the game award in just a bit.

1423
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:13,460
But right now, let's talk about a big PlayStation 4 title

1424
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:16,420
that's coming next year from the guys at Sucker Punch.

1425
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,340
Ghost of Tsushima.

1426
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:20,260
You probably saw this teased earlier this week.

1427
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:24,020
I am so excited about this game and what Sucker Punch is bringing to life.

1428
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:26,420
We have our longest world premiere on the show tonight,

1429
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,699
as I've been saying, a true cinematic look in joy.

1430
02:04:29,699 --> 02:04:31,939
Why is it not coming out in the PS5?

1431
02:04:31,939 --> 02:04:33,460
Why is it not coming out in the PS5?

1432
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:41,510
It's been developing for like seven years, guys.

1433
02:05:39,800 --> 02:06:02,899
That was a really powerful...

1434
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:08,659
Some say.

1435
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:19,880
Others say he is a storm made flesh.

1436
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:29,020
When the wind freshens their tents and boats, they know he is coming.

1437
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:56,409
Okay, as a weapons expert, half of this stuff is not even possible.

1438
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:45,739
Are we getting Final Fantasy VII here?

1439
02:07:45,739 --> 02:07:46,699
I feel like I've seen this.

1440
02:07:47,899 --> 02:08:10,069
The leaves are...

1441
02:08:10,069 --> 02:08:11,350
Oh, that's a bad idea.

1442
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:13,829
The leaves are gonna stop blowing around and like hitting people in the face.

1443
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:16,069
People are gonna find him in their hair.

1444
02:08:21,779 --> 02:08:25,140
Right now somebody has a big like 7-up.

1445
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:26,260
No, 7-11.

1446
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:29,060
A big 7-11 big gulp and one's gonna fall right in it.

1447
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:31,579
It could be 7-up in there.

1448
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:55,979
Imagine drinking a big gulp at the VGAs.

1449
02:08:57,930 --> 02:08:59,050
What's so wrong with that?

1450
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:02,760
Guys, I got news for you.

1451
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:05,079
If I ever go to the VGAs, I'm going like this.

1452
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,159
And I'm gonna have a fucking like 47 ounce big gulp.

1453
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,619
And I'm gonna have big sunglasses on.

1454
02:09:15,619 --> 02:09:17,300
Like I just got out of the eye doctor.

1455
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:18,819
And I'm gonna be sitting there like...

1456
02:09:18,819 --> 02:09:19,939
The Game Awards Orchestra.

1457
02:09:19,939 --> 02:09:22,100
Let's give it up for our incredible conductor tonight.

1458
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,939
Max Arouge, the Game Awards Orchestra.

1459
02:09:26,569 --> 02:09:32,090
They'll be back later for an incredible montage celebrating our Game of the Year nominees.

1460
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:34,489
And Game of the Year will be presented by some very special guests.

1461
02:09:34,489 --> 02:09:35,050
Are you sleeping?

1462
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:35,529
Surprise guests.

1463
02:09:35,529 --> 02:09:36,729
So stay tuned for that.

1464
02:09:36,729 --> 02:09:39,130
No, just like go cool.

1465
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:40,970
A look at Gears Tactics.

1466
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:41,449
Check it out.

1467
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:52,220
The game for us invaded every part of our world.

1468
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,960
So we did the only thing we could.

1469
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:59,369
We set the world on fire.

1470
02:10:02,489 --> 02:10:08,579
The war begins against the monster that created these monsters.

1471
02:10:08,579 --> 02:10:10,020
Come in the beast.

1472
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:11,380
The mon- the mon- the monstars.

1473
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,340
That's the monstars.

1474
02:10:12,979 --> 02:10:14,899
And it's time to go hunting.

1475
02:10:14,899 --> 02:10:15,939
I thought that was them.

1476
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:20,600
Oh, gentlemen, get shitheads.

1477
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:35,100
My newest creation thinks of your little plan.

1478
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:40,520
It's a long ass time.

1479
02:10:57,140 --> 02:11:00,819
Just once I want a game company to just blatantly fall on.

1480
02:11:00,819 --> 02:11:04,500
Fucking lie in their text as much as they lie in their gameplay footage.

1481
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:09,270
600 hour long campaign.

1482
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:22,409
Let's turn back to Twitch.

1483
02:11:22,409 --> 02:11:26,569
We asked Twitch to predict the winner for the best ongoing game category.

1484
02:11:26,569 --> 02:11:29,130
And they chose Final Fantasy XIV.

1485
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:32,170
We will find out when we present that award in a little bit.

1486
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,970
That's not a- that's only 27%.

1487
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,890
That must have been close.

1488
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:40,170
A performance that's going to rock the house by Green Day.

1489
02:11:41,369 --> 02:11:45,529
The award for best game direction and of course, game of the year.

1490
02:11:45,529 --> 02:11:49,609
Right now, here's a world premiere of a brand new game from a team in China.

1491
02:11:49,609 --> 02:11:53,689
It's a multiplayer melee combat game that you're seeing for the first time.

1492
02:11:53,689 --> 02:11:55,689
Multiplayer melee combat game.

1493
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,970
I feel like that's every game.

1494
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,079
All footage captured at Gary's house.

1495
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:55,989
Or all footage will be deleted.

1496
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:05,100
Or do not re-upload this copyright, you know, anything like that.

1497
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,199
Welcome to Magic School.

1498
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,079
Now that we've covered flying, let's talk about giant angels.

1499
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:38,600
Not to be confused with bird people.

1500
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:40,039
Bird people are their own thing.

1501
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:42,600
Play Magic the Gathering with me.

1502
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:43,399
Download free.

1503
02:13:44,039 --> 02:13:44,359
Free?

1504
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:47,449
A masterpiece.

1505
02:13:47,449 --> 02:13:50,970
How many years have I waited for this moment?

1506
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:52,949
Walmart of excellence.

1507
02:13:52,949 --> 02:13:55,829
For the one that stood alone against the storm.

1508
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:05,029
For the one they of light.

1509
02:14:05,029 --> 02:14:10,380
Is this the one that won?

1510
02:14:11,579 --> 02:14:20,220
This tragedy, greater even than the Seventh Umbral Calamity, must be undone.

1511
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:23,500
I- I- I- I know people- I'm late.

1512
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:24,300
This tree must be-

1513
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:25,420
I don't- whatever, I'm just gonna say it.

1514
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,380
Just drop the numbers from Final Fantasy.

1515
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:29,819
It's getting so fucking confusing.

1516
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:31,899
Just drop the numbers.

1517
02:14:31,899 --> 02:14:33,100
It was- Final Fantasy VIII.

1518
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:33,819
It's not coming up.

1519
02:14:33,819 --> 02:14:34,539
Just drop the numbers.

1520
02:14:35,899 --> 02:14:37,420
Just start doing colons.

1521
02:14:38,699 --> 02:14:44,220
Final Fantasy XIX, X1V2214.

1522
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:46,539
Just- just start making up other fucking titles.

1523
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:53,210
I made this tweet, like, five years ago.

1524
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:56,890
But, like, eat- like, when you have more numbers than the Jason movies.

1525
02:14:57,449 --> 02:14:59,640
Like, it's time to change it.

1526
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:03,399
My game's called Let's Be Well and it's made with the Roblox Studio game engine.

1527
02:15:04,039 --> 02:15:06,439
It starts off all grey.

1528
02:15:06,439 --> 02:15:08,760
This guy, it says he's depressed.

1529
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:13,079
As he plays the obstacle course, he learns about the depression.

1530
02:15:13,079 --> 02:15:16,600
So this is to get people talking so they don't bottle their feelings up.

1531
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:26,569
I was pregnant with our youngest son and my late husband got very, very sick.

1532
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:29,770
The doctors call it a major depressive episode.

1533
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:32,890
His mental illness overtook him by way of suicide.

1534
02:15:32,890 --> 02:15:35,930
And so we lost him when Luke was two years old at the time.

1535
02:15:36,489 --> 02:15:39,140
It's kind of hard to explain.

1536
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:41,859
Like, how my dad died when I was very young.

1537
02:15:41,859 --> 02:15:47,699
I just wanted to spread a positive message that it's okay to talk about mental illness.

1538
02:15:47,699 --> 02:15:49,140
I hope I've helped people.

1539
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:59,800
Now, she's a host and producer for IGN.

1540
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,720
Please welcome Sydney Goodman.

1541
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:12,409
To present the award for best ongoing game.

1542
02:16:12,409 --> 02:16:13,130
Recognizing that-

1543
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:13,770
Final Fantasy.

1544
02:16:14,329 --> 02:16:15,529
Final Fantasy.

1545
02:16:15,529 --> 02:16:21,130
Year after year and acknowledging the teams that keep these massively popular franchises

1546
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:25,609
fresh with new content, more experiences and evolving ways to play.

1547
02:16:26,329 --> 02:16:27,609
Here are the nominees.

1548
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:29,449
I thought we just did this.

1549
02:16:29,449 --> 02:16:30,810
Best ongoing game.

1550
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:41,100
I feel like we're seeing the same category.

1551
02:16:42,379 --> 02:16:51,850
Destiny 2, Fortnite Call of Duty.

1552
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:53,690
Am I going nuts?

1553
02:16:54,489 --> 02:16:57,850
And the game award for best ongoing game goes to...

1554
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:00,819
Fortnite.

1555
02:17:00,819 --> 02:17:02,569
You don't know.

1556
02:17:02,569 --> 02:17:04,889
She was just immediately like, you don't know.

1557
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:06,569
I know.

1558
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:08,489
But yeah, it's Fortnite.

1559
02:17:08,489 --> 02:17:09,850
You got it. You got it right.

1560
02:17:10,489 --> 02:17:11,690
What's that one that goes like this?

1561
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:13,370
This is amazing.

1562
02:17:13,370 --> 02:17:16,969
Thank you.

1563
02:17:16,969 --> 02:17:17,690
What's that one?

1564
02:17:17,690 --> 02:17:18,649
One that goes like this?

1565
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:31,030
So...

1566
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:31,670
I don't know.

1567
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:33,819
I don't know.

1568
02:17:33,819 --> 02:17:34,540
I don't know.

1569
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:35,100
I don't know.

1570
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:35,659
I don't know.

1571
02:17:35,659 --> 02:17:36,219
I don't know.

1572
02:17:36,219 --> 02:17:36,780
I don't know.

1573
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:37,500
I don't know.

1574
02:17:38,139 --> 02:17:43,819
So like last year, we represent just like the teeniest portion of the...

1575
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:49,020
Now over a thousand people who work to make Fortnite.

1576
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:49,739
What does that mean?

1577
02:17:49,739 --> 02:17:52,139
It's like a thousand players every single day.

1578
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:58,540
We'd like to thank all the thousand people that are spending millions of dollars on the store

1579
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:02,860
to have the opportunity to even make something like Fortnite.

1580
02:18:03,579 --> 02:18:04,299
It's incredible.

1581
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:09,500
I think that, you know, as I was saying earlier, right?

1582
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:14,620
Like this idea that we need to lean into what a persistent virtual place can be.

1583
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:17,819
And the more that we're trying to experiment with stuff and try different things,

1584
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:24,379
we're finding more and more that our goal is to try to create a metaverse.

1585
02:18:24,379 --> 02:18:26,139
To create a place, right?

1586
02:18:26,139 --> 02:18:29,500
Where all IP can live together.

1587
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:32,219
Where all kinds of experiences can happen.

1588
02:18:32,219 --> 02:18:35,340
Where we can create a thing that is totally new.

1589
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:39,340
A totally new emergent type of media, really.

1590
02:18:39,899 --> 02:18:43,659
And we are so inspired by everything you're doing.

1591
02:18:43,659 --> 02:18:46,459
I'm just blown away by what we see here tonight.

1592
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:49,100
It's truly astounding and incredible.

1593
02:18:51,819 --> 02:18:53,659
Thank you for all the work you do.

1594
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:56,540
Thank you for all the people who play Fortnite.

1595
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:01,260
For who come up to all of us all the time and give us your incredible ideas and your feedback.

1596
02:19:01,739 --> 02:19:03,899
We just can't wait to keep making more.

1597
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:08,780
I'd be remiss if I didn't take one little personal note to thank my wife,

1598
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:11,100
my daughter, my family, my party people.

1599
02:19:12,059 --> 02:19:12,940
We love you.

1600
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:13,819
Thank you so much.

1601
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,770
See you guys Saturday.

1602
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:19,610
And you got to do, you got to get credit for credit.

1603
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:27,450
They took a game that was a like third person plants versus zombies,

1604
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:28,969
like dumb third person shooter.

1605
02:19:28,969 --> 02:19:31,770
And they made it a BR that every single human role.

1606
02:19:31,770 --> 02:19:41,190
The developers who worked on Max Payne, Quantum Break, Armor 3, World of Danks.

1607
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:44,469
And they did that pursuit mobile.

1608
02:19:46,549 --> 02:20:02,950
But it's because of.

1609
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,059
Intel is located.

1610
02:20:12,059 --> 02:20:12,860
Okay.

1611
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:14,059
Thanks, Jane.

1612
02:20:14,059 --> 02:20:16,059
But the competition is sending their team.

1613
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:17,899
As expected.

1614
02:20:17,899 --> 02:20:18,940
Let's get this job done.

1615
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:29,530
What have they even shown?

1616
02:20:30,489 --> 02:20:30,889
There you go.

1617
02:20:30,889 --> 02:20:31,930
That's nine to five.

1618
02:20:31,930 --> 02:20:32,889
And I'm here with Red Hill Games.

1619
02:20:32,889 --> 02:20:37,049
They spent more time on the fake trailer than they did at the video game that they made.

1620
02:20:37,049 --> 02:20:37,770
What can we expect?

1621
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:38,090
Thank you.

1622
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:39,129
I'm glad to be here.

1623
02:20:39,129 --> 02:20:42,969
Nine to five is a new first person tactical shooter.

1624
02:20:42,969 --> 02:20:45,610
It's set in a world where corporations rule everything.

1625
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:47,610
And being a mercenary is just another job.

1626
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:50,969
Now a lot of modern shooters can be a little bit chaotic.

1627
02:20:50,969 --> 02:20:53,770
And that's kind of what makes nine to five special.

1628
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:58,569
We really put a lot of focus on the strategic gameplay of the team and playing together.

1629
02:20:59,450 --> 02:21:02,409
Making your changes and your tactics from round to round.

1630
02:21:02,409 --> 02:21:05,850
And obviously all that triumphs over brute force at the end.

1631
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:06,170
All right.

1632
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:07,530
Well, when can we expect to hear more?

1633
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:08,409
Next year or?

1634
02:21:08,409 --> 02:21:10,809
So 2020 we're launching the alpha.

1635
02:21:10,809 --> 02:21:14,569
But you can actually sign up today at nine to five dot game.

1636
02:21:14,569 --> 02:21:15,690
So go ahead.

1637
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:17,049
Enjoy and download.

1638
02:21:17,049 --> 02:21:17,370
All right.

1639
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:18,329
A little bit of a tease.

1640
02:21:18,329 --> 02:21:19,209
Nine to five.

1641
02:21:19,209 --> 02:21:19,450
All right.

1642
02:21:19,450 --> 02:21:20,489
Thanks very much for being here.

1643
02:21:20,489 --> 02:21:20,729
Thanks.

1644
02:21:20,729 --> 02:21:21,290
Appreciate it.

1645
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:21,450
All right.

1646
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:26,969
We're going to hand out some more awards right now in the category of esports game of the year.

1647
02:21:26,969 --> 02:21:35,690
The nominees are Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Dota 2, Fortnite, League of Legends, and Overwatch.

1648
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:36,409
What was it last year?

1649
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:41,209
And the game award goes to League of Legends.

1650
02:21:41,209 --> 02:21:42,569
Congratulations to Riot.

1651
02:21:42,569 --> 02:21:46,489
This category is the same category every year for the best VR AR game.

1652
02:21:46,489 --> 02:21:55,139
Those nominees are Asgard's Wrath, Blood and Truth, Beat Saber, No Man's Sky,

1653
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,180
and Trover Saves the Universe.

1654
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:02,899
And the game award goes to Beat Saber.

1655
02:22:02,899 --> 02:22:04,420
Congratulations to Beat Games.

1656
02:22:05,299 --> 02:22:07,940
Why is Trover Saves the Universe?

1657
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:12,020
Awarded to an individual for voiceover, acting, motion, and or performance capture.

1658
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:12,100
Seriously.

1659
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:17,700
The nominees are Ashley Burch for the Outer Worlds, Courtney Hope for Control,

1660
02:22:18,739 --> 02:22:23,700
Laura Bailey for Gears 5, Mads Mikkelsen for Death Stranding,

1661
02:22:24,969 --> 02:22:30,010
Matthew Peretta for Control, and Norman Reedus for Death Stranding.

1662
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:36,809
And the game award goes to Mads Mikkelsen for Death Stranding.

1663
02:22:36,809 --> 02:22:38,010
Congratulations, Mads.

1664
02:22:39,049 --> 02:22:43,129
This year he also added a fan category over the past few days.

1665
02:22:43,129 --> 02:22:47,129
He's going to get told he won that tomorrow by somebody that works with him in an office or

1666
02:22:47,129 --> 02:22:47,450
something.

1667
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:48,329
Your favorite game.

1668
02:22:48,329 --> 02:22:50,809
This was 100% in control of the fans.

1669
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:56,010
And the winner of the fan vote is Fire Emblem Three Houses.

1670
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:56,969
Congratulations.

1671
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,809
All right.

1672
02:22:58,809 --> 02:23:03,690
Well, throughout the show, you've heard incredible stories about global gaming citizens.

1673
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:06,889
And we're so honored to have them here with us tonight.

1674
02:23:06,889 --> 02:23:11,850
Please join me in recognizing this year's class of global gaming citizens.

1675
02:23:12,409 --> 02:23:13,770
We joke, but that's not even true.

1676
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:18,010
Because didn't Mads Mikkelsen actually say that he was like excited for like where the

1677
02:23:18,010 --> 02:23:19,049
medium is going?

1678
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:20,489
And that's not that's unfair.

1679
02:23:20,489 --> 02:23:21,370
That's unfair.

1680
02:23:21,370 --> 02:23:22,010
That's unfair.

1681
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:24,489
Congratulations, guys.

1682
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:31,899
Beautiful.

1683
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:33,159
A selfie.

1684
02:23:33,159 --> 02:23:33,959
All right.

1685
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:35,079
We're so proud of that program.

1686
02:23:35,079 --> 02:23:36,600
We intend to continue that year after year.

1687
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:41,479
I love telling all these stories of amazing people around the world who I think represent

1688
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:42,440
gaming at its best.

1689
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:42,920
All right.

1690
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:45,479
Up next, we've got music from Green Day.

1691
02:23:45,479 --> 02:23:47,479
Reggie's in the house to present.

1692
02:23:47,479 --> 02:23:48,920
Reggie's in the house.

1693
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:50,760
We've got more world premieres.

1694
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,959
Reggie's still here.

1695
02:23:51,959 --> 02:23:53,159
I thought I laughed my ass off.

1696
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:55,799
Actually, they're like, Reggie's here.

1697
02:23:55,799 --> 02:23:56,440
Reggie's here.

1698
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,360
And the show's charity's just gone.

1699
02:23:58,360 --> 02:23:59,079
But he's left.

1700
02:23:59,079 --> 02:24:01,959
Black Desert has only been available for PC and console.

1701
02:24:01,959 --> 02:24:03,079
Oh, Reggie left.

1702
02:24:03,799 --> 02:24:05,000
What the fuck are we doing now?

1703
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,639
You can download it tonight and get a true MMORPG at your fingertips.

1704
02:24:09,639 --> 02:24:10,120
Check it out.

1705
02:24:29,129 --> 02:24:33,290
Somebody just said, I can't believe they actually showed the Xbox.

1706
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:35,049
The new Xbox.

1707
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:37,829
That's insane.

1708
02:24:38,389 --> 02:24:39,590
I haven't even processed that.

1709
02:24:46,149 --> 02:24:49,350
There's somebody at E3 right now that organizes E3

1710
02:24:50,149 --> 02:24:53,430
that did a double hand on the desk go through the center of the table.

1711
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:55,590
It's just bent in half.

1712
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,500
At E3, we've decided.

1713
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:23,379
They already talked about the Xbox.

1714
02:25:23,379 --> 02:25:25,459
And the PS5 is leaked already.

1715
02:25:25,459 --> 02:25:26,180
Shit, what do we do?

1716
02:25:26,979 --> 02:25:28,739
All right, we're going to come up with a console.

1717
02:25:28,739 --> 02:25:30,100
The E3 console.

1718
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:33,670
Make sure it's more powerful than the Xbox.

1719
02:25:34,229 --> 02:25:37,219
We can run our own damn show.

1720
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,319
The EEB.

1721
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,799
The Electronic Entertainment Box.

1722
02:25:47,059 --> 02:25:47,459
Launch it.

1723
02:26:18,409 --> 02:26:20,940
I wonder.

1724
02:26:21,819 --> 02:26:26,139
I wonder who paid the most money on this particular game awards.

1725
02:26:28,069 --> 02:26:29,430
Can't be magic together.

1726
02:26:33,829 --> 02:26:34,950
Joe, back to back.

1727
02:26:35,909 --> 02:26:36,549
Back to back.

1728
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:38,950
HDR is where it's at.

1729
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:40,870
Quantum dot technology.

1730
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:42,950
These two paid for half this fucking show.

1731
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:48,389
Full array local dimming allows the brightest and darkest parts of the scene to look their best.

1732
02:26:48,389 --> 02:26:54,950
Features like these are why Samsung QLED TV was a Best of Innovation honoree for gaming at CES 2019.

1733
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:55,510
He's so good.

1734
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:57,829
And they're nominated again for 2020.

1735
02:26:57,829 --> 02:27:00,950
I just wanted to turn around and face the camera, but it's just like.

1736
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:09,500
Play this game.

1737
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:14,379
Letters written in the first couple months.

1738
02:27:14,379 --> 02:27:16,459
Which is just we were not prepared.

1739
02:27:16,459 --> 02:27:20,409
Words is a game about writing nice letters to people.

1740
02:27:20,409 --> 02:27:25,530
All real people anonymously online sharing their worries and making each other feel better.

1741
02:27:27,510 --> 02:27:31,030
Pushing the definition of games is something that I really get excited about.

1742
02:27:40,629 --> 02:27:41,829
Endless world.

1743
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:47,030
Endless heroes.

1744
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:48,469
This music is perfect.

1745
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:52,709
You'll never stop spending money in our fucking endless game.

1746
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:54,870
You're gonna try.

1747
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:57,110
But once you run out of gems.

1748
02:27:57,909 --> 02:27:59,350
You're gonna have to pay money.

1749
02:27:59,909 --> 02:28:02,309
Or wait 25 minutes to continue playing.

1750
02:28:05,989 --> 02:28:09,739
Oh, it says it's free.

1751
02:28:09,739 --> 02:28:11,579
But you and I both know it's not.

1752
02:28:13,370 --> 02:28:14,649
WD Black.

1753
02:28:14,649 --> 02:28:18,250
Fine tuned for performance.

1754
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:20,809
Purpose built for gaming to play without limits.

1755
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:26,569
Storage solutions with the capacity, speed, and reliability to win.

1756
02:28:27,370 --> 02:28:29,290
WD Black.

1757
02:28:30,010 --> 02:28:30,889
Drive your game.

1758
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:40,379
The Undertaker will take your money.

1759
02:28:40,379 --> 02:28:44,379
We are excited to welcome WD Black to the Game Awards as the official storage sponsor.

1760
02:28:44,379 --> 02:28:48,219
All of tonight's world premieres have been safely stored on WD Black.

1761
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:51,100
And is Reggie still in the audience?

1762
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:55,819
For a chance to win a decked out gaming rig and WD Black products.

1763
02:28:55,819 --> 02:28:56,540
All right.

1764
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:59,979
Now I'm very excited to introduce our next performance.

1765
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:02,940
One of my passions outside of gaming is live music.

1766
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:07,260
Whenever I go to a show, I'm always thinking about who would be perfect here for the Game Awards.

1767
02:29:12,059 --> 02:29:12,459
Here it comes.

1768
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:22,059
Am I allowed to stream this part?

1769
02:29:23,819 --> 02:29:24,860
Is this Vaude getting immuted?

1770
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:45,059
Do I have to mute my Vaude?

1771
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:49,000
I have to, I can't, I can't stream this part.

1772
02:29:50,459 --> 02:29:51,899
I actually can't stream this part.

1773
02:29:59,139 --> 02:30:00,100
Can I?

1774
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:10,680
Live stream.

1775
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,239
Just sing it.

1776
02:30:11,239 --> 02:30:49,930
Oh, he's standing up for the first time all the way on the warm show.

1777
02:30:50,649 --> 02:30:52,440
Get the glasses.

1778
02:30:53,079 --> 02:31:57,030
Oh, a lot of people are just like, they keep going.

1779
02:31:58,069 --> 02:32:01,430
I forgot the words to the song.

1780
02:32:02,309 --> 02:32:05,190
Somebody come, somebody go to the mic.

1781
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:05,909
I don't remember the song.

1782
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:34,100
Everybody loves Green Day.

1783
02:32:35,059 --> 02:32:38,920
How could you not like it?

1784
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:39,799
Everything's different.

1785
02:32:39,799 --> 02:32:40,600
What do you mean?

1786
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:41,799
Yeah, how could you?

1787
02:32:41,799 --> 02:32:42,360
I mean, no.

1788
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:48,440
There's at least one Green Day song that you actually like.

1789
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:49,000
I know there is.

1790
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:53,959
You added it to your Spotify playlist.

1791
02:32:55,079 --> 02:32:55,639
At least one.

1792
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:13,540
And I know this because almost every single high school commencement ceremony ends with a Green Day song.

1793
02:33:14,889 --> 02:33:16,489
And you nodded your head to it.

1794
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:36,500
Please bring Bunsen and Beaker out here.

1795
02:33:37,399 --> 02:33:44,860
Please get Bunsen and Beaker out here.

1796
02:33:44,860 --> 02:33:54,889
Look for it, look for it.

1797
02:33:54,889 --> 02:33:56,569
This one, it's the one, you know what I'm talking about.

1798
02:33:56,569 --> 02:33:59,370
It's gonna be like elbows in, out, out, bend, bend, bend.

1799
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:00,250
Watch.

1800
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:01,930
We'll see.

1801
02:34:03,139 --> 02:34:03,860
Follow my finger.

1802
02:34:06,409 --> 02:34:07,129
Follow my finger.

1803
02:34:07,930 --> 02:34:08,780
You watch.

1804
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:13,459
There it comes.

1805
02:34:13,459 --> 02:34:17,239
It's the, and you bend up, down, that one.

1806
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,340
No, fuck.

1807
02:34:23,829 --> 02:34:24,389
Somebody doing it.

1808
02:34:33,559 --> 02:34:44,260
I don't even give a shit about the song going on.

1809
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:46,420
I'm like looking for the Fortnite dancer.

1810
02:34:47,459 --> 02:35:39,350
I'm the only one doing it.

1811
02:35:39,909 --> 02:35:43,399
I'm the only person doing this.

1812
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:45,719
Now, do I have to put them down?

1813
02:35:45,719 --> 02:35:48,600
But I can't because that means that I've been admitting defeat.

1814
02:35:49,479 --> 02:36:07,020
Nobody did it.

1815
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:24,889
I was, I was.

1816
02:36:24,889 --> 02:36:25,610
How about that?

1817
02:36:25,610 --> 02:36:26,649
Green Day, everybody.

1818
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:31,129
The world's virtual reality and rock just collided like never before.

1819
02:36:31,129 --> 02:36:34,569
Beat Saber and Green Day, the collab we've always wanted.

1820
02:36:34,569 --> 02:36:36,329
And you don't have to wait long.

1821
02:36:36,329 --> 02:36:40,329
The music pack drops tonight on all platforms.

1822
02:36:40,329 --> 02:36:43,290
Soon to be able to play six of the band's iconic hits

1823
02:36:43,290 --> 02:36:45,690
and brand new singles from the album, Father of All,

1824
02:36:45,690 --> 02:36:47,690
which is out on February 7th.

1825
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:51,129
Thank you so much to Green Day for playing the Game Awards.

1826
02:36:51,850 --> 02:36:53,530
We have a lot of shows still coming up.

1827
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:55,530
Of course, we've got the award for best game direction.

1828
02:36:55,530 --> 02:36:56,969
You got, all right, game of the year.

1829
02:36:56,969 --> 02:36:59,450
And yes, we've still got some announcements and surprises for you guys.

1830
02:36:59,450 --> 02:37:01,610
He's trying to, at gaming's biggest night.

1831
02:37:01,610 --> 02:37:02,809
It just gets bigger and bigger.

1832
02:37:02,809 --> 02:37:04,409
He's trying to make this a big deal.

1833
02:37:04,409 --> 02:37:06,889
I, you gotta, you gotta give it a try.

1834
02:37:06,889 --> 02:37:07,610
He's trying.

1835
02:37:07,610 --> 02:37:08,110
Yes.

1836
02:37:10,250 --> 02:37:13,610
No, they're not leaving.

1837
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:15,290
They're going back to their seat.

1838
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:21,750
It is an eternal island of legend.

1839
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:25,350
Place of unimaginable beauty.

1840
02:37:30,889 --> 02:37:33,770
Where the forces of death and life.

1841
02:37:34,969 --> 02:37:37,479
Constant conflict.

1842
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:44,110
Listen!

1843
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:50,520
What?

1844
02:37:50,739 --> 02:37:54,420
For centuries, many have come in search of power.

1845
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:55,219
I'm not doing this.

1846
02:37:59,049 --> 02:37:59,850
Am I doing this?

1847
02:38:01,879 --> 02:38:04,120
Only to fall to its corruption.

1848
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,000
I'm not playing this, right?

1849
02:38:05,639 --> 02:38:15,340
I'm not, it's not, the video's not open.

1850
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:31,840
It's real.

1851
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:51,930
To this place, lured by the promise of power and immortality.

1852
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:55,899
This will claim you.

1853
02:38:57,180 --> 02:39:05,819
Do you really want to live?

1854
02:39:05,819 --> 02:39:06,620
Oh, I love it.

1855
02:39:08,139 --> 02:39:09,020
That's New World.

1856
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:12,540
And I was just down at Irvine at the studio visiting the devs a couple months ago.

1857
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:13,899
Had a great time playing it.

1858
02:39:13,899 --> 02:39:14,540
Looks really cool.

1859
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:16,940
And you can get more info at newworld.com.

1860
02:39:17,659 --> 02:39:18,059
All right.

1861
02:39:18,059 --> 02:39:22,379
Well, now please welcome to the stage a good friend of the Game Awards.

1862
02:39:22,379 --> 02:39:27,100
He's been here every year since the first show with a perfect attendance record.

1863
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:29,899
Of course, he's the former president of Nintendo of America.

1864
02:39:29,899 --> 02:39:30,700
A friend to all of us.

1865
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:31,200
Let's go!

1866
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:33,040
Bring him on!

1867
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:35,040
Give it up for Reggie Fesemek!

1868
02:39:40,649 --> 02:39:42,090
Got the cool glasses.

1869
02:39:42,809 --> 02:39:44,729
And he's got the cool glasses.

1870
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:54,879
You all made fun of me for that?

1871
02:39:59,020 --> 02:40:00,780
Fesemek is in the house.

1872
02:40:04,399 --> 02:40:06,799
Thank you, thank you, thank you for that warm welcome.

1873
02:40:08,270 --> 02:40:13,629
It was just over 16 years ago that I joined this industry as an executive.

1874
02:40:14,829 --> 02:40:21,629
But truth be told, I've been around as a fan and as a player for so much longer.

1875
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:27,239
Like you, I've witnessed the growth of our favorite form of entertainment.

1876
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:31,559
And now video games are bigger than the movie industry.

1877
02:40:34,670 --> 02:40:35,790
Bigger than music.

1878
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:37,709
Can he just be the president of all video games?

1879
02:40:37,709 --> 02:40:42,000
Bigger than television.

1880
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,920
But most importantly, video games continue to innovate.

1881
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:52,879
Not only as entertainment, but also into areas far more profound.

1882
02:40:53,840 --> 02:41:00,479
Experiences with their foundation in video game technology are being used to help surgeons

1883
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:02,719
practice before a difficult procedure.

1884
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:10,239
And to enable college students to simulate business situations and develop real-world skills.

1885
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:14,860
I may no longer be an executive in this industry,

1886
02:41:15,579 --> 02:41:21,979
but I'll always be an ambassador for video games as a force for good and a force for fun.

1887
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:28,569
He's quitting?

1888
02:41:29,930 --> 02:41:30,969
Don't think you got the memo.

1889
02:41:32,110 --> 02:41:34,989
In this category, fresh indie game,

1890
02:41:35,709 --> 02:41:40,190
you can see how games are continuing to evolve as entertainment.

1891
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:44,559
I think this is the most important award of the night.

1892
02:41:45,440 --> 02:41:51,120
Because I believe indie developers are the most important creators in this industry.

1893
02:41:56,379 --> 02:41:56,940
Why?

1894
02:41:56,940 --> 02:41:58,540
Why, who wrote that?

1895
02:41:58,540 --> 02:42:05,659
Because every nominee this year and every year at one time was an indie developer.

1896
02:42:06,909 --> 02:42:13,229
In the same sense that everyone was once a kid sketching a superhero in the middle of class.

1897
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:20,520
Or lying in bed at night thinking of worlds and challenges that no one had ever dreamed of before.

1898
02:42:21,399 --> 02:42:29,950
For my friend, Shigeru Miyamoto, those ideas began around the woods near his house in Kyoto.

1899
02:42:30,989 --> 02:42:33,549
And for my dear departed friend, Satoru Iwata,

1900
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:41,479
those ideas led him to invent his first video game on a portable calculator while he was still in high school.

1901
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:47,180
These guys fucking made everything.

1902
02:42:48,059 --> 02:42:52,379
They both became fixtures in the history of video games.

1903
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:55,420
But first, they were dreamers.

1904
02:42:56,139 --> 02:42:58,540
And they began with their imagination.

1905
02:42:59,500 --> 02:43:04,219
So like everyone else, at the start, they were true indie developers.

1906
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:10,520
Any awards event is, by definition, a look backwards.

1907
02:43:11,239 --> 02:43:13,879
Who's done something great in the preceding year?

1908
02:43:15,209 --> 02:43:17,930
But in this category, you can look forward.

1909
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:24,239
If you want to see the incubator where future game greatness is evolving,

1910
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:29,040
it resides right here in this indie category,

1911
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:35,280
recognizing brand new independent studios who released their first game this year.

1912
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:36,420
Really?

1913
02:43:38,139 --> 02:43:40,620
Fresh indie game presented by Subway.

1914
02:43:43,290 --> 02:43:44,489
Oh shit, this is really?

1915
02:44:09,530 --> 02:44:10,170
They're all good.

1916
02:44:11,959 --> 02:44:14,440
And the game award goes to...

1917
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,379
Disco Elysium.

1918
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:25,899
Disco Elysium also wins Best Independent Game.

1919
02:44:25,899 --> 02:44:29,180
Tonight, they're taking home a total of four game awards.

1920
02:44:39,360 --> 02:44:45,360
So I'd like to thank all the great people that came before us.

1921
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:46,159
Ilya Repin,

1922
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:47,920
Ilya Repin,

1923
02:44:48,559 --> 02:44:49,920
Vladimir Mayakovsky,

1924
02:44:50,959 --> 02:44:51,760
Viktor Tsoi,

1925
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:56,799
and Marks and Engels for providing us the political education.

1926
02:44:56,799 --> 02:44:57,280
Thank you.

1927
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:09,399
Well, come here.

1928
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:18,540
I've been looking back, looking back my whole life.

1929
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:22,139
Back to my family, my friends,

1930
02:45:23,479 --> 02:45:24,120
my son.

1931
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:30,270
They say you can't change a person, but a person can change with time.

1932
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:34,120
Change a mind, change a heart.

1933
02:45:37,819 --> 02:45:39,899
Yeah, that might be good enough for you.

1934
02:45:39,979 --> 02:45:47,709
But I can change anything.

1935
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:58,200
Is that a game?

1936
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:00,920
Is this another single player League of Legends game?

1937
02:46:01,959 --> 02:46:02,840
Alright, surprise.

1938
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:05,639
There's a second League of Legends announcement tonight.

1939
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:08,600
I'm joined by the creative director of Double Stallion Games, Lee Thomas.

1940
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:11,319
Lee, why don't you tell us a bit about what we just saw?

1941
02:46:11,319 --> 02:46:11,719
Sure.

1942
02:46:11,719 --> 02:46:13,799
Well, that was quite an experience.

1943
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:15,719
So yeah, we're here.

1944
02:46:15,719 --> 02:46:17,719
It's been an amazing time keeping this secret,

1945
02:46:17,719 --> 02:46:21,639
but we are working with Riot Forge making Convergence, a League of Legends story.

1946
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:23,159
So what is it?

1947
02:46:23,159 --> 02:46:26,360
It's a single player action platformer where you play Echo.

1948
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:30,600
Echo is a young inventor who has created a device that can manipulate time.

1949
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:34,040
And we're going to send you down into Zorn, into the depths of the sump.

1950
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:38,040
And we're going to deliver a rich story experience about perils and consequences of

1951
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:44,280
League of Legends has so many fans and people really, really love these characters.

1952
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:49,000
They wouldn't just like Disney style, just make like eight different Mickey Mouse shows.

1953
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:49,239
All right.

1954
02:46:49,239 --> 02:46:53,239
In just a moment, five of the nominees are going to go head to head in the best game

1955
02:46:53,239 --> 02:46:54,280
direction category.

1956
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,319
We'll see who wins that one.

1957
02:46:55,319 --> 02:46:57,079
And we've still got some surprises left.

1958
02:46:57,079 --> 02:46:58,680
The game awards will be right back.

1959
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:03,399
So they've like how many no stadium?

1960
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:04,760
No, I'm sorry.

1961
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:05,479
I am talking.

1962
02:47:08,010 --> 02:47:09,850
How many champions are in League of Legends?

1963
02:47:09,850 --> 02:47:10,969
Like 250.

1964
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:14,510
That's 250 different separate TV shows they could make.

1965
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:25,260
Stadia is a gift that won't ever stop growing.

1966
02:47:26,219 --> 02:47:27,979
A gift that doesn't take up any space.

1967
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:39,440
The gift of a gift that gives you games anywhere and everywhere and anywhere

1968
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:42,479
and any everywhere with Wi-Fi.

1969
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:45,840
You can even ask yourself for Stadia and give it to yourself.

1970
02:47:46,799 --> 02:47:50,159
Get the unthinkable, multi-screenable, no downloads, no updates,

1971
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:52,559
self-giftable gift of Stadia.

1972
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:56,079
One place for all the ways we play.

1973
02:48:00,889 --> 02:48:03,049
When are you ever going to do that on an iPhone screen?

1974
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:07,200
Be real with me for a minute.

1975
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,760
Why would you just bring it to you and take a shit?

1976
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:12,159
But then you have to have the controller.

1977
02:48:12,879 --> 02:48:16,639
So you have the controller in your hand, but then you have an iPhone that you hold in your mouth.

1978
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:22,670
I go, gee, can you use the iPhone to do it?

1979
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:23,629
Is the iPhone a controller?

1980
02:48:24,350 --> 02:48:33,680
Do you have to take the phone and do a thing?

1981
02:48:34,479 --> 02:48:44,989
No, I don't want to just put that.

1982
02:48:44,989 --> 02:48:47,549
I don't want to feel like a big AAA game on the toilet.

1983
02:48:48,110 --> 02:48:53,469
When I sit down to play a game, I sit there for like fucking two hours sometimes.

1984
02:48:54,270 --> 02:48:55,790
I'm not going to sit on the toilet for two hours.

1985
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:56,829
I've done it before.

1986
02:48:58,670 --> 02:49:12,190
Oh, that's actually kind of cool.

1987
02:49:12,829 --> 02:49:15,639
I would play that.

1988
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:18,920
Nintendo Switch has worlds to explore and adventures to conquer.

1989
02:49:22,889 --> 02:49:25,930
But that trailer was kind of bizarre.

1990
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:28,409
I would probably play that game.

1991
02:49:29,530 --> 02:49:40,829
Find your adventure on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite.

1992
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:43,709
I forgot that came out.

1993
02:49:44,350 --> 02:49:46,190
We heard you may want to quit vaping.

1994
02:49:46,190 --> 02:49:47,629
But we can't help you.

1995
02:49:47,629 --> 02:49:49,309
We can barely hold these protest signs.

1996
02:49:49,309 --> 02:49:51,549
But we can tell you about this is quitting.

1997
02:49:51,549 --> 02:49:53,229
An easy text to quit service.

1998
02:49:53,229 --> 02:49:53,950
It's the least.

1999
02:49:53,950 --> 02:49:55,309
And most we can do.

2000
02:49:58,879 --> 02:49:59,680
I don't need to say it.

2001
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,280
Oh, it's back.

2002
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:06,719
Look at all the information on the screen.

2003
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:10,079
Did I count four health bars?

2004
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:20,799
This is like when you go to someone's house that has a World of Warcraft.

2005
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:23,440
And they have like 30 mods installed.

2006
02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:29,120
And you can't even physically log in with your character because everything is so fucking strange.

2007
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,399
The UI is so different.

2008
02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:32,000
And they have like a million things on the screen.

2009
02:50:32,559 --> 02:50:40,399
I played all games like that with no, uh, you probably can't hear what I'm saying.

2010
02:50:51,389 --> 02:51:01,770
Never mind.

2011
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:02,729
What's going on, everybody?

2012
02:51:02,729 --> 02:51:05,129
I'm professional esports host and commentator Goldenboy.

2013
02:51:05,129 --> 02:51:11,930
And since 2017, Samsung and Xbox have worked together to deliver amazing experiences for all gamers.

2014
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:16,090
That's why I teamed up with them to create something special for the fans.

2015
02:51:16,090 --> 02:51:18,569
The ultimate FTW sweepstakes.

2016
02:51:18,569 --> 02:51:24,010
And I want to give a huge shout out to our winner, Isaiah Yanez, also known as Buddy Roy.

2017
02:51:24,010 --> 02:51:27,129
You are the winner of the upgrade FTW sweepstakes.

2018
02:51:27,129 --> 02:51:35,290
You won this killer Samsung 75 inch Q70R QLED TV, a Q70 soundbar, an Xbox One X,

2019
02:51:35,290 --> 02:51:38,010
and 12 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

2020
02:51:38,010 --> 02:51:39,370
Safe to say that's a lot of nuts.

2021
02:51:39,370 --> 02:51:40,170
Congrats.

2022
02:51:40,170 --> 02:51:42,010
And thank you so much for joining us here tonight.

2023
02:51:42,010 --> 02:51:44,250
Now, everyone, let's just enjoy the game award some more.

2024
02:51:44,889 --> 02:51:45,610
I would.

2025
02:51:45,610 --> 02:51:46,090
I did it.

2026
02:51:46,969 --> 02:51:48,090
Thank you, Goldenboy.

2027
02:51:48,090 --> 02:51:52,170
And now it's time for a world premiere, a re-announcement that I think you'll be excited about.

2028
02:51:52,170 --> 02:51:53,129
A re-announcement.

2029
02:51:53,129 --> 02:51:53,690
Elden Ring.

2030
02:51:55,129 --> 02:51:56,809
All right, if it's Elden Ring, I'd be real happy.

2031
02:51:57,370 --> 02:51:57,930
Elden Ring.

2032
02:52:00,270 --> 02:52:06,750
There was a time when you were heartless, brutal monster.

2033
02:52:10,489 --> 02:52:12,889
And I'm proud of you for changing all that.

2034
02:52:12,889 --> 02:52:22,409
But I'm here to ask you to be those things once more for them.

2035
02:52:22,409 --> 02:52:27,719
For me, can I count on you?

2036
02:52:27,719 --> 02:52:29,479
Who the fuck is making this game?

2037
02:52:29,479 --> 02:52:29,979
Bigby.

2038
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:32,200
Can I count on you?

2039
02:52:35,420 --> 02:52:47,209
Is that Ghost Written by Telltale?

2040
02:52:47,209 --> 02:52:51,450
Now, she's an Emmy-winning writer and an accomplished voice actor.

2041
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:53,610
Please welcome Ashley Birch.

2042
02:52:57,739 --> 02:53:00,700
Didn't say somebody bought Telltale, right?

2043
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,579
Hello, everyone.

2044
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:03,739
They purchased Telltale.

2045
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:09,340
The best games start with a single person asking a single question.

2046
02:53:09,899 --> 02:53:10,379
What if?

2047
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:15,020
And when that question excites other people and they start asking what if,

2048
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:17,579
it's a snowball of creativity and passion

2049
02:53:17,579 --> 02:53:20,139
that pushes games to be the best they can possibly be.

2050
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:23,739
These are the nominees for the Best Game Direction.

2051
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:26,059
Best Game Direction.

2052
02:53:26,059 --> 02:53:27,420
Who's making that game?

2053
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:28,139
I can't get over it.

2054
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:30,559
Who's making it?

2055
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,360
So hard to pull a connection.

2056
02:53:36,879 --> 02:53:55,000
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

2057
02:53:55,639 --> 02:53:57,959
Resident Evil 2, hands down, is the best one.

2058
02:53:57,959 --> 02:53:59,000
Hands down.

2059
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,200
If it loses, Alex will be mad.

2060
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:00,920
Death Stranding.

2061
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:03,879
All right, that makes me actually, I'm actually upset about that.

2062
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:08,200
I never get invested in this shit, but that actually makes me irritated.

2063
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:09,719
I'm actually irritated by that.

2064
02:54:09,719 --> 02:54:10,219
I am.

2065
02:54:14,799 --> 02:54:20,399
Resident Evil 2, from start to finish, was close to perfectly paced.

2066
02:54:24,809 --> 02:54:27,899
Thank you.

2067
02:54:27,979 --> 02:54:28,700
Thank you so much.

2068
02:54:39,559 --> 02:54:41,959
It was a start from zero four years ago,

2069
02:54:41,959 --> 02:54:44,520
but I'm very happy to come back to this stage tonight.

2070
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:20,760
I really want to thank a lot of people who started the ship going.

2071
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:26,360
Sony started out with us and also Guerrilla for providing the game engine.

2072
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:31,159
And also, it was a small boat, but all the cast came on board,

2073
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:33,879
the musicians, the artists, the people who collaborated.

2074
02:55:33,879 --> 02:55:34,920
Thank you so much.

2075
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:38,200
Konami right now is crying somewhere in slot machine revenue.

2076
02:55:39,079 --> 02:55:40,680
Came to work together.

2077
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:45,079
I would really like to thank them and also my family.

2078
02:55:45,879 --> 02:55:49,079
And best of all, the fans who waited four years.

2079
02:55:49,079 --> 02:55:49,879
Thank you so much.

2080
02:55:51,079 --> 02:55:57,840
Konami looked at their balance sheet and said,

2081
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:05,040
hey, we made more money in one day with our slot machines than in a decade of video game revenue.

2082
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,440
We've got some very special surprise guests here to do the honors.

2083
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:10,319
Over on Twitter, you guys voted for the gaming tweet of the year.

2084
02:56:10,319 --> 02:56:11,360
We've got the winning tweet.

2085
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:11,840
Check it out.

2086
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,479
And we'll be right back with game of the year.

2087
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:15,680
It's over?

2088
02:56:16,239 --> 02:56:16,639
This is it.

2089
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:17,040
It's coming up.

2090
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:17,520
This is the end.

2091
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:22,079
Resident Evil 2 has got to come.

2092
02:56:22,079 --> 02:56:22,719
It's got something.

2093
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:25,440
Mr. X is like the best.

2094
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:25,920
Mr. X.

2095
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:37,899
Mr. X is the best video game antagonist for very, very, very long.

2096
02:56:48,829 --> 02:57:08,170
I think it's the masks because this is not Destiny 2,

2097
02:57:08,170 --> 02:57:10,889
but it's the Destiny 2 mask with the blue lights in it.

2098
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:13,559
Yes, that's the problem.

2099
02:57:13,559 --> 02:57:18,760
Is there every game has the mask with the lights in it, the green or blue lights in the mask?

2100
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:21,399
What is this?

2101
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:34,649
It literally said it was ESO.

2102
02:57:54,520 --> 02:57:56,040
Is there a best VR game?

2103
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:56,440
Why?

2104
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:58,200
Why is that strangely absent?

2105
02:57:59,159 --> 02:58:00,729
Is that not here?

2106
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:05,399
It already happened?

2107
02:58:10,010 --> 02:58:11,530
Why was super hot VR not on it?

2108
02:58:12,409 --> 02:58:19,950
Oh, super hot VR came out in 2017.

2109
02:58:25,440 --> 02:58:26,000
Excuse me.

2110
02:58:35,319 --> 02:58:36,600
Room temperature IQ.

2111
02:58:37,399 --> 02:58:39,260
Have you guys heard of Magic the Gathering?

2112
02:58:39,979 --> 02:58:41,100
Check it out.

2113
02:58:41,979 --> 02:58:45,420
Play right now.

2114
02:59:03,239 --> 02:59:03,959
All right.

2115
02:59:03,959 --> 02:59:04,520
What was that?

2116
02:59:05,479 --> 02:59:06,750
That looked cool.

2117
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:07,790
Is it a Predator game?

2118
02:59:24,729 --> 02:59:26,010
No, I see the honeycomb.

2119
02:59:26,010 --> 02:59:26,729
I'm not interested.

2120
02:59:27,370 --> 02:59:33,200
You can guarantee I won't play a game if it has the honeycomb on it.

2121
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:34,959
That's just personal preference.

2122
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:35,360
I'm sorry.

2123
03:00:01,659 --> 03:00:02,940
Download a bunch of free games.

2124
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:03,819
I keep them forever.

2125
03:00:07,579 --> 03:00:10,459
Now she's an actress and producer.

2126
03:00:10,459 --> 03:00:12,860
Please welcome Michelle Rodriguez.

2127
03:00:13,979 --> 03:00:15,819
That's how we add a game of the year.

2128
03:00:15,819 --> 03:00:20,729
How y'all doing today?

2129
03:00:21,930 --> 03:00:22,889
I've invested in this.

2130
03:00:22,889 --> 03:00:23,530
How are you?

2131
03:00:23,530 --> 03:00:26,540
I'm happy to be here.

2132
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:31,440
There's one last game announcement to share with you tonight.

2133
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:33,040
And I'm really excited about it.

2134
03:00:34,239 --> 03:00:39,680
Allow me to present the world premiere of our latest expansion to the Fast and Furious saga.

2135
03:00:53,610 --> 03:00:54,489
I'm inflated.

2136
03:00:56,809 --> 03:00:57,930
Is it a movie?

2137
03:00:57,930 --> 03:00:58,729
I'm going to split.

2138
03:00:59,450 --> 03:01:01,209
It's the only way to keep you both safe.

2139
03:01:02,569 --> 03:01:04,700
I think I know someone who can help.

2140
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:09,819
You ready to ride?

2141
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:14,959
I'm hunting anybody.

2142
03:01:14,959 --> 03:01:23,569
Revenge.

2143
03:01:24,909 --> 03:01:26,110
We want justice.

2144
03:01:26,110 --> 03:01:28,270
Vin Diesel did not voice act in this game.

2145
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:31,309
They just pulled samples from the last 10 movies.

2146
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:33,959
You know how many times he says that?

2147
03:01:37,479 --> 03:01:39,059
Let's go.

2148
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:42,020
For sure.

2149
03:01:42,799 --> 03:01:43,879
Come on.

2150
03:01:43,879 --> 03:01:46,299
When in doubt, do what I do.

2151
03:01:46,299 --> 03:01:46,860
See?

2152
03:01:46,860 --> 03:01:47,979
I've seen what you do.

2153
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:53,309
That's why I'm kind of terrified.

2154
03:01:53,309 --> 03:01:54,670
And I don't need a finish line.

2155
03:01:54,670 --> 03:02:01,819
I'm in my own lane.

2156
03:02:01,819 --> 03:02:04,620
Vin Diesel will live off of royalties that people are using.

2157
03:02:10,329 --> 03:02:15,290
Vin Diesel will live forever with his just generic free sentences that he said.

2158
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:22,829
He will be collecting just revenue forever.

2159
03:02:22,829 --> 03:02:24,190
I'm excited for that one.

2160
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:27,469
Everyone wants to live forever.

2161
03:02:29,469 --> 03:02:34,270
From a little article in a newspaper to a movie to a video game.

2162
03:02:34,270 --> 03:02:35,069
It's pretty cool.

2163
03:02:35,870 --> 03:02:43,129
I'd like to now introduce a surprise guest and also one of my friends for life.

2164
03:02:43,690 --> 03:02:44,409
Is it Vin Diesel?

2165
03:02:44,409 --> 03:02:45,129
Vin Diesel.

2166
03:02:46,170 --> 03:03:00,190
I hope he just speaks in one-liners.

2167
03:03:00,190 --> 03:03:00,750
It would be great.

2168
03:03:01,629 --> 03:03:04,409
I want him to speak in one-liners.

2169
03:03:05,049 --> 03:03:05,549
Do it.

2170
03:03:16,809 --> 03:03:23,120
Michelle, we are in our crowd.

2171
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:26,879
We have been gamers.

2172
03:03:26,879 --> 03:03:28,959
We have been gamers forever.

2173
03:03:28,959 --> 03:03:30,559
And we are at an award show.

2174
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:32,079
Of our people.

2175
03:03:32,079 --> 03:03:33,600
Why is he leaning down sideways?

2176
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:34,239
Literally.

2177
03:03:34,239 --> 03:03:35,040
Literally.

2178
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:38,639
Me and Vin used to just like literally spend all night playing like

2179
03:03:38,639 --> 03:03:41,120
Tekken Fighter games or Street Fighter.

2180
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:51,600
Yeah this is uh it's amazing to see that that trailer finally.

2181
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:56,299
I didn't tell you before.

2182
03:03:57,260 --> 03:04:01,180
Yesterday I saw the four-minute trailer to Fast Night.

2183
03:04:01,180 --> 03:04:02,219
What is he doing?

2184
03:04:02,219 --> 03:04:03,020
Turn this way.

2185
03:04:03,979 --> 03:04:08,399
Why is this back to the audience?

2186
03:04:08,399 --> 03:04:10,399
Back to you guys.

2187
03:04:10,399 --> 03:04:13,079
Um I love all of you.

2188
03:04:13,079 --> 03:04:15,079
Uh okay so.

2189
03:04:15,079 --> 03:04:19,520
Like at this point Vin just grabbed the mic and lifted up from the base.

2190
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:21,520
Here to pay tribute to all of the nominees.

2191
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:24,520
Game of the year once again.

2192
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:26,520
The Game Awards Orchestra.

2193
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:31,079
Is it nailed down?

2194
03:04:31,079 --> 03:04:43,049
Just her reaction was awesome.

2195
03:04:43,049 --> 03:04:46,569
She's just like.

2196
03:04:46,569 --> 03:04:52,200
That little like yeah.

2197
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:54,200
I am not certain of very many things.

2198
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:56,200
But I am certain of this.

2199
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:59,520
More than anything.

2200
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:03,950
The Outer Worlds is not going to win Game of the Year.

2201
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:16,250
I have never been more certain of something in my entire life.

2202
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:18,250
It just will not.

2203
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:26,399
Does that make me a villain for saying that?

2204
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:28,399
That's not going to win Game of the Year.

2205
03:05:30,399 --> 03:05:32,399
That makes me a villain.

2206
03:05:32,399 --> 03:05:50,250
Apparently.

2207
03:05:50,250 --> 03:06:06,010
I mean but like Smash is like a pretty big achievement.

2208
03:06:06,010 --> 03:06:08,010
There's so much stuff in Smash.

2209
03:06:08,010 --> 03:06:10,010
There's so much in it.

2210
03:06:10,010 --> 03:06:12,010
There's like a thousand characters.

2211
03:06:12,010 --> 03:06:14,010
They keep adding them.

2212
03:06:14,010 --> 03:06:18,299
I've seen some.

2213
03:06:21,819 --> 03:06:23,819
That kind of startled me.

2214
03:06:23,819 --> 03:06:44,680
I mean it could be that too.

2215
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:46,680
But I don't think so.

2216
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:49,629
That wasn't it.

2217
03:06:49,629 --> 03:06:51,629
Sekiro was a really polarizing game.

2218
03:06:51,629 --> 03:06:53,629
It was very polarizing.

2219
03:06:53,629 --> 03:06:56,440
There's like a you either really liked it or you hated it.

2220
03:06:56,440 --> 03:06:58,440
For Sekiro.

2221
03:06:58,440 --> 03:07:03,440
Or a lot of people.

2222
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:06,510
That was pretty polarizing.

2223
03:07:06,510 --> 03:07:12,719
I liked it.

2224
03:07:12,719 --> 03:07:14,719
Yeah.

2225
03:07:14,719 --> 03:07:16,719
And which game on this list.

2226
03:07:16,719 --> 03:07:18,719
Had no polarizing.

2227
03:07:18,719 --> 03:07:20,719
I mean besides this guy.

2228
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:23,020
I don't know what.

2229
03:07:23,020 --> 03:07:32,989
Where did he come from?

2230
03:07:32,989 --> 03:07:34,989
He's the only one on that list that makes sense to me.

2231
03:07:34,989 --> 03:07:45,600
Come on.

2232
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:47,600
Sekiro is good. It was. It was very good.

2233
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:50,409
Smash Brothers.

2234
03:07:50,409 --> 03:07:52,409
Really good achievement in video games.

2235
03:07:52,409 --> 03:07:54,409
But Resident Evil.

2236
03:07:54,409 --> 03:07:56,409
The remake.

2237
03:07:56,409 --> 03:07:58,969
What remakes can be.

2238
03:07:58,969 --> 03:08:00,969
They keep telling me don't lean down.

2239
03:08:00,969 --> 03:08:04,559
As my daughter would say.

2240
03:08:04,559 --> 03:08:06,559
Dad.

2241
03:08:06,559 --> 03:08:08,559
But it's not.

2242
03:08:08,559 --> 03:08:10,559
It's very good.

2243
03:08:10,559 --> 03:08:12,559
The game of the year award.

2244
03:08:12,559 --> 03:08:18,319
Goes to.

2245
03:08:18,319 --> 03:08:25,549
Sekiro.

2246
03:08:25,549 --> 03:08:27,549
Tonight Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.

2247
03:08:27,549 --> 03:08:29,549
Also wins best action adventure game.

2248
03:08:40,170 --> 03:08:49,770
The knife just hit behind me.

2249
03:08:49,770 --> 03:08:51,770
Boom.

2250
03:08:51,770 --> 03:08:53,770
The tomahawk just hit the fucking wall.

2251
03:08:53,770 --> 03:09:03,100
I agree.

2252
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:05,100
He's very moved.

2253
03:09:05,100 --> 03:09:07,100
He's very moved.

2254
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:09,100
He's very moved.

2255
03:09:09,100 --> 03:09:11,100
If it wasn't Resident Evil.

2256
03:09:11,100 --> 03:09:13,100
I agree.

2257
03:09:13,100 --> 03:09:15,100
If it wasn't Resident Evil.

2258
03:09:15,100 --> 03:09:17,100
I agree.

2259
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:19,100
If it wasn't Resident Evil.

2260
03:09:19,100 --> 03:09:21,100
I agree.

2261
03:09:21,100 --> 03:09:23,100
I agree.

2262
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:25,100
So Sekiro

2263
03:09:25,100 --> 03:09:27,100
has a lot of difficult

2264
03:09:27,100 --> 03:09:29,100
and complex elements that made us a little

2265
03:09:29,100 --> 03:09:31,100
unsure.

2266
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:33,100
When it was about to come out.

2267
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:35,100
And we were both surprised

2268
03:09:35,100 --> 03:09:37,100
and overjoyed at the reaction

2269
03:09:37,100 --> 03:09:39,100
that we saw.

2270
03:09:39,100 --> 03:09:41,100
So I'd like to share

2271
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:43,100
the joy of receiving this award

2272
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:45,100
with the staff at From Software

2273
03:09:45,100 --> 03:09:47,100
who pulled out all the stops to make it happen

2274
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:49,100
as well as the team at Activision

2275
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:51,100
for their ongoing support throughout.

2276
03:09:51,100 --> 03:09:53,100
It was good.

2277
03:09:53,100 --> 03:09:55,100
We're sad that Resident Evil

2278
03:09:55,100 --> 03:09:57,100
didn't win anything.

2279
03:10:12,079 --> 03:10:14,079
And finally, I'd like to

2280
03:10:14,079 --> 03:10:16,079
give out a huge thank you

2281
03:10:16,079 --> 03:10:18,079
to our players.

2282
03:10:18,079 --> 03:10:20,079
We couldn't have done it without you

2283
03:10:20,079 --> 03:10:22,079
and it was a huge honor to make.

2284
03:10:22,079 --> 03:10:24,079
So we will continue to try and make

2285
03:10:24,079 --> 03:10:26,079
the best games we possibly can.

2286
03:10:26,079 --> 03:10:28,079
Thank you.

2287
03:10:28,079 --> 03:10:30,079
Congratulations from Software, Miyazaki-san.

2288
03:10:30,079 --> 03:10:36,799
Game of the Year for Sekiro.

2289
03:10:36,799 --> 03:10:47,739
Alright guys, well that's going to do it for the Game Awards 2019.

2290
03:10:47,739 --> 03:10:49,739
Thank you so much for joining us.

2291
03:10:49,739 --> 03:10:51,739
We'll see you again next time.

2292
03:10:51,739 --> 03:10:53,739
Thank you.

2293
03:10:55,739 --> 03:10:57,739
It's December, to keep celebrating games.

2294
03:10:57,739 --> 03:10:59,739
Have a great night. Thank you very much.

2295
03:10:59,739 --> 03:11:01,739
Good night everybody.

2296
03:11:34,139 --> 03:11:46,409
Here are my thoughts.

2297
03:11:46,409 --> 03:12:00,239
I don't remember any of the games.

2298
03:12:00,239 --> 03:12:02,670
I don't remember anything.

2299
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:05,290
I remember

2300
03:12:05,290 --> 03:12:09,069
No More Heroes 3.

2301
03:12:09,069 --> 03:12:11,069
And then I remember the Gemini Man trailer.

2302
03:12:11,069 --> 03:12:15,610
So if that means anything,

2303
03:12:15,610 --> 03:12:17,610
that means

2304
03:12:17,610 --> 03:12:20,239
that No More Heroes 3 is probably

2305
03:12:20,239 --> 03:12:22,239
going to be cool, I think.

2306
03:12:22,239 --> 03:12:27,920
That's what that means.

2307
03:12:27,920 --> 03:12:29,920
Constant conflict.

2308
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:31,920
We did get a constant conflict, you're right.

2309
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:33,920
The Muppets came out, yeah.

2310
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:35,920
They were there.

2311
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:42,319
And The Goose was there too.

2312
03:12:42,319 --> 03:12:49,360
What else happened?

2313
03:12:49,360 --> 03:12:53,180
I don't know.

2314
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:55,180
We saw a bunch of MMOs

2315
03:12:55,180 --> 03:12:57,180
and some mobile games.

2316
03:12:57,180 --> 03:13:02,559
Reggie was there, Green Day was there.

2317
03:13:02,559 --> 03:13:06,520
Magic the Gathering.

2318
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:08,520
I'm kind of sad that

2319
03:13:08,520 --> 03:13:10,520
Resident Evil 2 didn't win anything.

2320
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:13,020
The time that I had...

2321
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:15,020
Let me get the headphone out of here.

2322
03:13:15,020 --> 03:13:18,280
I don't want anyone talking to me.

2323
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:20,909
The feeling of real dread.

2324
03:13:20,909 --> 03:13:39,399
It was a remake.

2325
03:13:39,399 --> 03:13:42,600
So what?

2326
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:46,760
It was a remake from 1998.

2327
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:48,760
It was a really, really

2328
03:13:48,760 --> 03:13:50,760
good game.

2329
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:52,760
It was the feeling of dread

2330
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,760
going around corners.

2331
03:13:54,760 --> 03:13:56,760
It was brilliantly paced.

2332
03:13:56,760 --> 03:13:58,760
It was the revitalization of Capcom as a company.

2333
03:13:58,760 --> 03:14:00,760
They came out with Monster Hunter World.

2334
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:02,760
That was great.

2335
03:14:02,760 --> 03:14:05,770
And then they had Resident Evil 2, and now they're coming out with Resident Evil 3.

2336
03:14:05,770 --> 03:14:10,440
You said that already.

2337
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:12,440
Don't you know that when you lose,

2338
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:14,440
you just go on repeat until you

2339
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:22,319
go to sleep that night?

2340
03:14:22,319 --> 03:14:24,319
When the stream's over, I'm going to be in the mirror going,

2341
03:14:24,319 --> 03:14:26,319
the sense of dread that I had.

2342
03:14:26,319 --> 03:14:28,319
Turning the corners, Mr. X

2343
03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:30,319
was so brilliantly, brilliantly

2344
03:14:30,319 --> 03:14:33,520
cast. And then I'm going to

2345
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:35,520
turn the shower on, like lean backwards

2346
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:37,520
and have cold water just hit me right in my eyes.

2347
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:42,569
Sekiro won. I know, I know.

2348
03:14:42,569 --> 03:14:44,569
But I think Resident Evil 2 deserves something.

2349
03:14:44,569 --> 03:14:46,569
Even if it was just like

2350
03:14:46,569 --> 03:14:48,569
they brought him on stage and gave him a fucking

2351
03:14:48,569 --> 03:14:50,569
like, you got a shot lollipop.

2352
03:14:50,569 --> 03:14:53,129
I thought it was Game of the Year. I thought it was.

2353
03:14:53,129 --> 03:14:55,129
I thought it was, but you know, whatever.

2354
03:14:55,129 --> 03:14:57,129
You can't win them all. You can't win them all.

2355
03:14:57,129 --> 03:14:59,129
Because I obviously had something to do with that game.

2356
03:14:59,129 --> 03:15:01,129
So I'm so invested.

2357
03:15:01,129 --> 03:15:08,170
You know, you can't win them all.

2358
03:15:08,170 --> 03:15:16,940
Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.

2359
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:18,940
He's a 10 on the German scale. No, it was a fuck chill.

2360
03:15:18,940 --> 03:15:23,040
They're trying.

2361
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:27,639
Alright, you guys ready?

2362
03:15:27,639 --> 03:15:29,639
Talking about constant conflict. I don't even know if that game was.

2363
03:15:29,639 --> 03:15:31,639
I just know it exists.

2364
03:15:31,639 --> 03:15:35,850
Okay, so

2365
03:15:35,850 --> 03:15:38,540
those of you that don't know what we're about to talk about

2366
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:40,969
I actually have to change to just chatting.

2367
03:15:40,969 --> 03:15:43,600
If you just stuck around for the game awards

2368
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:45,600
thanks for sticking around.

2369
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:47,899
Those of you that are still here

2370
03:15:47,899 --> 03:15:49,899
we're going to spend a little bit of time going over what's going to happen

2371
03:15:49,899 --> 03:15:51,899
this weekend.

2372
03:15:51,899 --> 03:15:57,079
I never played the Claire campaign.

2373
03:15:57,079 --> 03:15:59,079
I didn't stream the Claire campaign.

2374
03:15:59,079 --> 03:16:01,639
What? I'm not allowed to play something?

2375
03:16:01,639 --> 03:16:03,639
I didn't, I did not play it off stream.

2376
03:16:03,639 --> 03:16:14,319
I'm lying to you.

2377
03:16:14,319 --> 03:16:16,319
No, I'm kidding.

2378
03:16:16,319 --> 03:16:18,319
My god. You think I would say something to Game of the Year

2379
03:16:18,319 --> 03:16:20,319
if I didn't do it all? I played half the game.

2380
03:16:20,319 --> 03:16:23,319
Hey, I played all of Sekiro

2381
03:16:23,319 --> 03:16:25,559
and I played half of Resident Evil 2

2382
03:16:25,559 --> 03:16:27,559
and I thought, uh oh, that's bad.

2383
03:16:27,559 --> 03:16:29,559
Somebody's going to be like, what the fuck did he just say?

2384
03:16:29,559 --> 03:16:35,639
Anyways,

2385
03:16:35,639 --> 03:16:37,639
take a look at your screen here.

2386
03:16:37,639 --> 03:16:44,680
We're going to do some drawing.

2387
03:16:44,680 --> 03:16:51,340
Take a look at your screen. We are going to talk about

2388
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:53,340
what's happening this weekend.

2389
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:55,340
What are you doing this weekend? What do you mean this weekend?

2390
03:16:55,340 --> 03:16:57,340
This weekend we're going to play a little game

2391
03:16:57,340 --> 03:16:59,340
called Fuck the King.

2392
03:16:59,340 --> 03:17:02,540
I didn't even change category. That's my bad.

2393
03:17:02,540 --> 03:17:06,569
I'll just keep it as obnoxious audience member.

2394
03:17:06,569 --> 03:17:16,170
That's fine.

2395
03:17:16,170 --> 03:17:18,670
So on Sunday,

2396
03:17:18,670 --> 03:17:20,670
there'll be, you'll, uh,

2397
03:17:20,670 --> 03:17:23,159
that's the next stream that's going to happen.

2398
03:17:23,159 --> 03:17:26,620
So you will not see me

2399
03:17:26,620 --> 03:17:30,200
until Sunday.

2400
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:32,200
About an hour before the stream starts on Sunday

2401
03:17:32,200 --> 03:17:34,200
because there's a lot of stuff that we still need to do.

2402
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:36,200
We will begin the process

2403
03:17:36,200 --> 03:17:38,200
of putting people into the server.

2404
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:42,620
Show your Resident Evil 2 achievements.

2405
03:17:42,620 --> 03:17:47,100
No, I don't have to do that.

2406
03:17:47,100 --> 03:17:49,100
So, what is going to happen?

2407
03:17:49,100 --> 03:17:52,620
First and foremost, let's start drawing.

2408
03:17:52,620 --> 03:17:55,239
On Sunday, if you are

2409
03:17:55,239 --> 03:17:58,319
a two month

2410
03:17:58,319 --> 03:18:00,319
long subscriber,

2411
03:18:00,319 --> 03:18:02,319
why am I doing this?

2412
03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:13,959
The only way that you will have

2413
03:18:13,959 --> 03:18:15,959
access to this game

2414
03:18:15,959 --> 03:18:17,959
is if you have been subbed to the channel for two months straight.

2415
03:18:17,959 --> 03:18:21,610
The reason why this had to happen

2416
03:18:21,610 --> 03:18:23,790
is because of very obvious things.

2417
03:18:23,790 --> 03:18:26,540
We're trying to protect the server

2418
03:18:26,540 --> 03:18:28,540
from getting

2419
03:18:28,540 --> 03:18:30,540
just overloaded with people.

2420
03:18:30,540 --> 03:18:32,840
We're trying to protect the server from

2421
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:34,840
insane amounts of connections.

2422
03:18:34,840 --> 03:18:37,659
And we do already have things in place

2423
03:18:37,659 --> 03:18:39,659
to help with that.

2424
03:18:39,659 --> 03:18:41,659
There's a lot of stuff that these guys are pros.

2425
03:18:41,659 --> 03:18:46,079
They know exactly what they're doing.

2426
03:18:46,079 --> 03:18:48,079
You have to be subbed for two months to play.

2427
03:18:48,079 --> 03:18:50,700
Now what does playing mean?

2428
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:55,120
Playing is

2429
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:57,479
opening up your Minecraft client,

2430
03:18:57,479 --> 03:18:59,479
going to the server,

2431
03:18:59,479 --> 03:19:01,479
and starting

2432
03:19:01,479 --> 03:19:03,850
in our little town.

2433
03:19:03,850 --> 03:19:07,760
Our little town is going to look like this.

2434
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:13,129
Our little town

2435
03:19:13,129 --> 03:19:15,129
is going to look like this.

2436
03:19:15,129 --> 03:19:17,559
There's going to be a castle here.

2437
03:19:17,559 --> 03:19:21,979
Like this.

2438
03:19:21,979 --> 03:19:23,979
And down here there'll be some houses.

2439
03:19:23,979 --> 03:19:27,120
Probably, you know, just random little town houses.

2440
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:30,379
There'll be a little garden over here.

2441
03:19:30,379 --> 03:19:34,920
No.

2442
03:19:34,920 --> 03:19:39,520
It's an apple.

2443
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:41,520
It's a spider.

2444
03:19:41,520 --> 03:19:44,200
Will you guys just relax?

2445
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:46,200
Alright, I can't look at chat. You guys are making me laugh.

2446
03:19:48,639 --> 03:19:50,639
So in this town,

2447
03:19:50,639 --> 03:19:52,639
there's a castle, right?

2448
03:19:52,639 --> 03:19:54,639
Ooh, look, the castle was here.

2449
03:19:54,639 --> 03:19:56,639
Inside of this castle is going to be

2450
03:19:56,639 --> 03:19:59,319
me. I am

2451
03:19:59,319 --> 03:20:04,639
the king of this kingdom.

2452
03:20:04,639 --> 03:20:06,639
The goal that you guys have, by the way,

2453
03:20:06,639 --> 03:20:08,639
there are, I gotta write this down too because I want as much

2454
03:20:08,639 --> 03:20:12,670
info as I can.

2455
03:20:12,670 --> 03:20:14,670
The server holds just about

2456
03:20:14,670 --> 03:20:16,670
just over 500 people.

2457
03:20:16,670 --> 03:20:20,379
Can be on this Minecraft server.

2458
03:20:20,379 --> 03:20:22,379
That's important. Two months substrate.

2459
03:20:22,379 --> 03:20:24,379
500 people can play at once.

2460
03:20:24,379 --> 03:20:28,090
And it's going to cycle out all the time.

2461
03:20:28,090 --> 03:20:30,270
Because we have a

2462
03:20:30,270 --> 03:20:32,270
some code and an API in place.

2463
03:20:32,270 --> 03:20:34,270
For, if you are a sub,

2464
03:20:34,270 --> 03:20:36,270
if you are a two month plus sub,

2465
03:20:36,270 --> 03:20:38,440
you just simply have to log into the server

2466
03:20:38,440 --> 03:20:40,440
and authenticate your, with Twitch.

2467
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:42,440
That's how the whitelisting

2468
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:46,090
is going to work. There's going to be a

2469
03:20:46,090 --> 03:20:48,090
separate little site that you're going

2470
03:20:48,090 --> 03:20:50,090
to link into.

2471
03:20:50,090 --> 03:20:52,090
And you'll get a code. And it'll verify

2472
03:20:52,090 --> 03:20:54,090
that you are subbed for two months.

2473
03:20:54,090 --> 03:20:56,329
And then you can join the server.

2474
03:20:56,329 --> 03:20:58,329
When you join the server,

2475
03:20:58,329 --> 03:21:02,110
you are going to be

2476
03:21:02,110 --> 03:21:05,239
zero years old.

2477
03:21:05,239 --> 03:21:09,659
Now what does that mean? That means

2478
03:21:09,659 --> 03:21:12,280
there's an aging system in the game.

2479
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:14,280
It takes, as of right now,

2480
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:17,149
ten hours

2481
03:21:17,149 --> 03:21:19,709
for you to die. This is, by the way,

2482
03:21:19,709 --> 03:21:21,709
it is a hardcore server. If you die

2483
03:21:21,709 --> 03:21:26,120
you're out. If you die

2484
03:21:26,120 --> 03:21:30,219
you cannot come back in. You start

2485
03:21:30,219 --> 03:21:32,219
at zero, you're going to age, it's going to take

2486
03:21:32,219 --> 03:21:34,219
ten hours. You have ten hours of time.

2487
03:21:34,219 --> 03:21:38,059
When you are zero,

2488
03:21:38,059 --> 03:21:41,639
you can't talk.

2489
03:21:41,639 --> 03:21:44,139
You're essentially a baby.

2490
03:21:44,139 --> 03:21:52,000
You can't talk.

2491
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:57,180
You can't build. And you can't hold

2492
03:21:57,180 --> 03:22:01,280
a weapon. How could you?

2493
03:22:01,280 --> 03:22:06,909
And, by the way, you walk

2494
03:22:06,909 --> 03:22:08,909
at minus

2495
03:22:08,909 --> 03:22:10,909
probably, we're trying to still figure out how

2496
03:22:10,909 --> 03:22:12,909
fast, probably like minus a hundred percent speed.

2497
03:22:12,909 --> 03:22:18,799
All players

2498
03:22:18,799 --> 03:22:21,040
I'm going to like make this smaller.

2499
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:29,290
The age from zero

2500
03:22:29,290 --> 03:22:31,659
to, probably like zero

2501
03:22:31,659 --> 03:22:33,659
to two, zero to three, is

2502
03:22:33,659 --> 03:22:35,659
going to take probably about twenty

2503
03:22:35,659 --> 03:22:39,370
minutes. Because you age

2504
03:22:39,370 --> 03:22:42,250
zero to a hundred. So let me

2505
03:22:42,250 --> 03:22:48,329
add this here. Start at zero

2506
03:22:48,329 --> 03:22:50,329
and die at a hundred.

2507
03:22:50,329 --> 03:23:00,190
At about ninety years

2508
03:23:00,190 --> 03:23:02,879
old, you

2509
03:23:02,879 --> 03:23:04,879
slow down.

2510
03:23:04,879 --> 03:23:07,819
You can't craft that many

2511
03:23:07,819 --> 03:23:09,819
materials anymore. You can't

2512
03:23:09,819 --> 03:23:11,819
swing a weapon as fast as you used

2513
03:23:11,819 --> 03:23:15,530
to. And you're probably saying

2514
03:23:15,530 --> 03:23:17,530
wait a minute, why are you doing this? Well

2515
03:23:17,530 --> 03:23:20,090
if you start at zero and can't

2516
03:23:20,090 --> 03:23:22,090
talk, and can't do anything

2517
03:23:22,090 --> 03:23:24,780
that prevents you from being

2518
03:23:24,780 --> 03:23:26,780
able to just try

2519
03:23:26,780 --> 03:23:28,780
to come kill me immediately. You could.

2520
03:23:28,780 --> 03:23:30,780
You could.

2521
03:23:30,780 --> 03:23:32,780
You can still punch.

2522
03:23:32,780 --> 03:23:34,780
You're just not going to do very much damage.

2523
03:23:34,780 --> 03:23:38,940
Good luck. By the way, if you die you can't

2524
03:23:38,940 --> 03:23:45,079
come back. So

2525
03:23:45,079 --> 03:23:48,409
I would be careful if I were you.

2526
03:23:48,409 --> 03:23:51,479
A baby rush.

2527
03:23:51,479 --> 03:23:53,479
I'm not going to tell you how to play this

2528
03:23:53,479 --> 03:23:56,040
game because this is an experiment.

2529
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:58,219
Baby rush the castle.

2530
03:23:58,219 --> 03:24:00,219
Well, if you do that

2531
03:24:00,219 --> 03:24:02,219
just be known that

2532
03:24:02,219 --> 03:24:04,219
you can't come back and you are going to

2533
03:24:04,219 --> 03:24:06,219
get all new players.

2534
03:24:06,219 --> 03:24:08,219
I already wrote this. All

2535
03:24:08,219 --> 03:24:10,219
new players.

2536
03:24:10,219 --> 03:24:12,219
All new players.

2537
03:24:12,219 --> 03:24:14,219
I'm going to outline this.

2538
03:24:14,219 --> 03:24:16,399
All new players.

2539
03:24:16,399 --> 03:24:19,719
Start at zero. There's going

2540
03:24:19,719 --> 03:24:21,719
to be a separate lobby where people

2541
03:24:21,719 --> 03:24:23,719
can hang out. Potentially even a separate server

2542
03:24:23,719 --> 03:24:26,479
that you're going to connect to.

2543
03:24:26,479 --> 03:24:28,840
Whoever dies, the next

2544
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:30,840
person in line is going to come in

2545
03:24:30,840 --> 03:24:36,799
that has a connected Twitch account.

2546
03:24:36,799 --> 03:24:38,799
So let's say that there is five hundred people in the

2547
03:24:38,799 --> 03:24:40,799
server and a hundred and fifty

2548
03:24:40,799 --> 03:24:42,799
of you decide to communicate with each other

2549
03:24:42,799 --> 03:24:44,799
somehow and do a baby rush.

2550
03:24:44,799 --> 03:24:46,799
And all of you just don't make it.

2551
03:24:46,799 --> 03:24:48,799
A hundred people that were next in line that have their

2552
03:24:48,799 --> 03:24:50,799
Twitches connected that are in the lobby will be put into

2553
03:24:50,799 --> 03:24:59,049
the game at zero. Do these

2554
03:24:59,049 --> 03:25:01,049
rules apply to you?

2555
03:25:01,049 --> 03:25:06,110
No. The king, which is

2556
03:25:06,110 --> 03:25:08,110
me, has double

2557
03:25:08,110 --> 03:25:11,120
health and

2558
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:14,110
double armor because I'm

2559
03:25:14,110 --> 03:25:21,149
the fucking king. Oh, sorry.

2560
03:25:21,149 --> 03:25:23,149
Forgot to mention something else. Very, very,

2561
03:25:23,149 --> 03:25:25,149
very important. Let's put it over here.

2562
03:25:25,149 --> 03:25:27,319
There is a stamina

2563
03:25:27,319 --> 03:25:29,760
bar. You have to eat, guys.

2564
03:25:29,760 --> 03:25:31,760
And you have to sleep.

2565
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:34,700
You have a stamina bar. It's going to be

2566
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:39,239
in replace of the experience bar.

2567
03:25:39,239 --> 03:25:41,420
If you get to zero stamina, well

2568
03:25:41,420 --> 03:25:43,420
you're going to be very useless because that

2569
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:49,950
means you haven't eaten. All

2570
03:25:49,950 --> 03:25:52,510
actions, and again,

2571
03:25:52,510 --> 03:25:54,510
all actions

2572
03:25:54,510 --> 03:25:56,510
require stamina.

2573
03:25:56,510 --> 03:25:58,879
That's putting a block down.

2574
03:25:58,879 --> 03:26:00,879
That's swinging a weapon. That's

2575
03:26:00,879 --> 03:26:03,309
walking. That's running.

2576
03:26:03,309 --> 03:26:08,940
If you do not eat,

2577
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:16,920
you're not going to be able to do shit.

2578
03:26:16,920 --> 03:26:20,760
I have to eat, but I have

2579
03:26:20,760 --> 03:26:22,760
the three or four caches

2580
03:26:22,760 --> 03:26:24,760
of steaks in my trunk behind me.

2581
03:26:24,760 --> 03:26:31,290
What do I care? How are you going to eat his babies?

2582
03:26:31,290 --> 03:26:33,290
Don't worry.

2583
03:26:33,290 --> 03:26:43,280
There'll be ways to eat. Poison the

2584
03:26:43,280 --> 03:26:48,270
king. There is going to

2585
03:26:48,270 --> 03:26:51,079
be another spot.

2586
03:26:51,079 --> 03:26:53,079
So this is all, we'll slow down here for a second

2587
03:26:53,079 --> 03:26:56,280
here. When you join the

2588
03:26:56,280 --> 03:26:59,870
game, when you join the server,

2589
03:26:59,870 --> 03:27:01,870
like I said, you're going to have to connect to your Twitch, see if you have two

2590
03:27:01,870 --> 03:27:03,870
months up, you can come in. We're going to spend about an hour

2591
03:27:03,870 --> 03:27:05,870
before the stream truly

2592
03:27:05,870 --> 03:27:07,870
begins, just getting everybody

2593
03:27:07,870 --> 03:27:14,010
connected. So once everybody's

2594
03:27:14,010 --> 03:27:16,010
in place, and we have

2595
03:27:16,010 --> 03:27:18,010
commands, and we have plugins, we're just going to

2596
03:27:18,010 --> 03:27:20,010
keep you, we're going to keep you staying put.

2597
03:27:20,010 --> 03:27:22,959
Outside of these

2598
03:27:22,959 --> 03:27:25,450
walls is the wilderness.

2599
03:27:25,450 --> 03:27:28,780
Outside here, right?

2600
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:30,780
Let's just like a million

2601
03:27:30,780 --> 03:27:32,780
meters outside.

2602
03:27:32,780 --> 03:27:35,600
The real important shit happens inside

2603
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:37,600
the town. Outside

2604
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:39,600
the town, you are free

2605
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:41,600
to go get resources.

2606
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:43,600
You can do whatever you want. You can go build

2607
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:45,600
whatever you want. This is kind of like

2608
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:47,600
out of play. But you can

2609
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:52,649
use it to get resources.

2610
03:27:52,649 --> 03:27:54,649
We are actually still toying with the idea of having

2611
03:27:54,649 --> 03:27:56,649
a couple of different servers.

2612
03:27:56,649 --> 03:27:59,209
That the town is one server,

2613
03:27:59,209 --> 03:28:01,209
the wilderness is another

2614
03:28:01,209 --> 03:28:03,209
instance, right?

2615
03:28:03,209 --> 03:28:09,020
Who's going to protect the babies?

2616
03:28:09,020 --> 03:28:12,799
Kind of rot in the wild.

2617
03:28:12,799 --> 03:28:14,799
Can babies kill babies?

2618
03:28:19,979 --> 03:28:24,270
What you guys

2619
03:28:24,270 --> 03:28:27,079
are doing in this game,

2620
03:28:27,079 --> 03:28:29,079
remember, if I die,

2621
03:28:29,079 --> 03:28:33,120
it's over. You have to

2622
03:28:33,120 --> 03:28:35,120
remember,

2623
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:37,120
these two age groups here are

2624
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:39,120
really only in place to

2625
03:28:39,120 --> 03:28:41,420
prevent people from just

2626
03:28:41,420 --> 03:28:43,420
like detonating the whole server

2627
03:28:43,420 --> 03:28:47,520
instantly. So

2628
03:28:47,520 --> 03:28:49,520
if you have 10 hours to be

2629
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:51,819
in the server, realistically

2630
03:28:51,819 --> 03:28:53,819
only about 30 or 40 minutes of that

2631
03:28:53,819 --> 03:28:55,819
time, if you stay alive, is

2632
03:28:55,819 --> 03:28:57,819
going to be at these more constrained

2633
03:28:57,819 --> 03:29:05,819
parts of your life. People who are

2634
03:29:05,819 --> 03:29:07,819
age 3 are just going to slaughter people

2635
03:29:07,819 --> 03:29:09,819
who come in.

2636
03:29:09,819 --> 03:29:11,819
Well, it's funny you say that.

2637
03:29:11,819 --> 03:29:13,819
Because we're also toying with the idea

2638
03:29:13,819 --> 03:29:16,120
of having a

2639
03:29:16,120 --> 03:29:18,120
tag on people's heads that kill

2640
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:20,120
innocent people for no reason.

2641
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:26,139
I'm the king. And I'm

2642
03:29:26,139 --> 03:29:28,139
going to have a bunch of kingsguard.

2643
03:29:28,139 --> 03:29:30,139
And a bunch of loyal people.

2644
03:29:30,139 --> 03:29:33,920
If there is a crime that's committed that needs

2645
03:29:33,920 --> 03:29:35,920
to be brought to my attention, I will go investigate

2646
03:29:35,920 --> 03:29:40,459
this. I'm going to have a team

2647
03:29:40,459 --> 03:29:42,459
of people that are going to be keeping the peace.

2648
03:29:42,459 --> 03:29:48,989
I'm not just going to let my kingdom

2649
03:29:48,989 --> 03:29:50,989
fall into total ruin. Why would

2650
03:29:50,989 --> 03:29:56,239
I do that? I'm going to, I will

2651
03:29:56,239 --> 03:29:58,239
come out and I will solve problems. I will

2652
03:29:58,239 --> 03:30:00,239
teleport the perpetrator into

2653
03:30:00,239 --> 03:30:02,239
the throne room and we will have a little

2654
03:30:02,239 --> 03:30:05,760
trial. Well, you're going to be

2655
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:07,760
teleporting a bunch of people into that throne room

2656
03:30:07,760 --> 03:30:09,760
because nobody's going to stop killing

2657
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,760
zero aged people.

2658
03:30:11,760 --> 03:30:23,020
It's going to be very, very fun.

2659
03:30:23,020 --> 03:30:25,020
For a lot of different reasons.

2660
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:28,350
I kind

2661
03:30:28,350 --> 03:30:30,350
of want to just see how this

2662
03:30:30,350 --> 03:30:32,350
plays out. When is this happening on

2663
03:30:32,350 --> 03:30:36,250
Sunday? Do the kingsguard

2664
03:30:36,250 --> 03:30:38,250
age at the same rate that you do?

2665
03:30:38,250 --> 03:30:44,459
Yes. When I kill

2666
03:30:44,459 --> 03:30:46,459
your guards, will they respawn? No.

2667
03:30:46,459 --> 03:30:48,639
Nobody respawns.

2668
03:30:48,639 --> 03:30:51,899
How's it going to be streamed?

2669
03:30:51,899 --> 03:30:53,899
So, there's going to be a separate

2670
03:30:53,899 --> 03:30:55,899
mobile studio that is made

2671
03:30:55,899 --> 03:30:58,780
that is going to be

2672
03:30:58,780 --> 03:31:00,780
streaming the event

2673
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:02,780
and we're going to have like three or four different

2674
03:31:02,780 --> 03:31:04,780
cameras, free cam flying around to

2675
03:31:04,780 --> 03:31:06,780
cut to, and my perspective.

2676
03:31:06,780 --> 03:31:13,760
Because I want to be able to see what

2677
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:15,760
some of the other shit that's happening. I want you, for a viewer

2678
03:31:15,760 --> 03:31:18,569
perspective, right? It's more

2679
03:31:18,569 --> 03:31:20,569
interesting if you guys

2680
03:31:20,569 --> 03:31:22,569
get to see a ton of different perspectives. If you're playing

2681
03:31:22,569 --> 03:31:24,569
the game, sure, just you're playing the game and you're

2682
03:31:24,569 --> 03:31:26,569
participating in the little experiment, right?

2683
03:31:26,569 --> 03:31:28,569
But you won't just see

2684
03:31:28,569 --> 03:31:32,729
my point of view. You'll

2685
03:31:32,729 --> 03:31:34,729
hear me talk and I'll be

2686
03:31:34,729 --> 03:31:36,729
going over the things that need to be

2687
03:31:36,729 --> 03:31:41,020
going over with my kingdom.

2688
03:31:41,020 --> 03:31:43,579
How do you join? When this

2689
03:31:43,579 --> 03:31:46,010
server launches, like I said,

2690
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:48,010
there's going to be just a little lobby that you can

2691
03:31:48,010 --> 03:31:50,639
just be in. You then

2692
03:31:50,639 --> 03:31:52,639
connect your Twitch with a separate, there's going to be a

2693
03:31:52,639 --> 03:31:54,639
separate website that you're going to

2694
03:31:54,639 --> 03:31:56,639
use, that you're going to connect your Twitch API to

2695
03:31:56,639 --> 03:31:58,639
it. It just pulls

2696
03:31:58,639 --> 03:32:00,639
how many months you've been subscribed to

2697
03:32:00,639 --> 03:32:02,639
my channel. That's it. Doesn't do anything else.

2698
03:32:02,639 --> 03:32:09,229
Can the guards betray you?

2699
03:32:09,229 --> 03:32:18,879
No. Jeremy,

2700
03:32:18,879 --> 03:32:21,180
you're trying to get my data.

2701
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:23,180
No, let me be very, very clear

2702
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:25,180
about something. This

2703
03:32:25,180 --> 03:32:27,360
is not, oh yeah,

2704
03:32:27,360 --> 03:32:29,360
I'm just like running a server.

2705
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:31,719
There's a lot of resources

2706
03:32:31,719 --> 03:32:33,719
put into this to make sure it works.

2707
03:32:33,719 --> 03:32:36,409
There's a lot of protection,

2708
03:32:36,409 --> 03:32:38,409
there's a lot of servers.

2709
03:32:38,409 --> 03:32:40,409
It is not just

2710
03:32:40,409 --> 03:32:45,920
running in my basement.

2711
03:32:45,920 --> 03:32:47,920
This stupid experiment

2712
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:49,920
is really important

2713
03:32:49,920 --> 03:32:52,409
to me. I don't care

2714
03:32:52,409 --> 03:32:54,409
if I die in the first five minutes

2715
03:32:54,409 --> 03:32:56,409
by falling down the fucking

2716
03:32:56,409 --> 03:32:58,909
stairs. I don't care.

2717
03:32:58,909 --> 03:33:02,799
By the way, this

2718
03:33:02,799 --> 03:33:04,799
first iteration

2719
03:33:04,799 --> 03:33:07,040
of, it's called FTK, it's called

2720
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:09,600
Fuck The King, FTK. The first

2721
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:11,600
iteration is very much going to be

2722
03:33:11,600 --> 03:33:13,600
an alpha beta.

2723
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:21,079
We're just trying to see if it works.

2724
03:33:21,079 --> 03:33:23,079
After we do one, we'll have

2725
03:33:23,079 --> 03:33:25,450
a lot of, we'll have

2726
03:33:25,450 --> 03:33:30,000
a lot of info. I want to do

2727
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:32,000
this more than once. I want to

2728
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,000
add more stuff to it. I want to make it more interesting.

2729
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:36,360
I want to add more, I want to add

2730
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:38,360
like quests and shit eventually. I want to

2731
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:40,360
do a bunch of random shit with this server.

2732
03:33:40,360 --> 03:33:45,229
And going back and forth with

2733
03:33:45,229 --> 03:33:47,229
some of the developers and the people that are making the

2734
03:33:47,229 --> 03:33:49,229
plugins and the server and everything,

2735
03:33:49,229 --> 03:33:51,229
they're excited too. They want to do

2736
03:33:51,229 --> 03:33:53,229
more stuff on top of this as well.

2737
03:33:53,229 --> 03:33:56,620
But the first one is just to see

2738
03:33:56,620 --> 03:33:58,620
if we can do it and how long

2739
03:33:58,620 --> 03:34:00,620
I can last and how

2740
03:34:00,620 --> 03:34:02,620
democratically this whole thing can

2741
03:34:02,620 --> 03:34:04,620
play out or not. And it's just chaos.

2742
03:34:04,620 --> 03:34:06,620
And 500 of you

2743
03:34:06,620 --> 03:34:08,620
rush the front door.

2744
03:34:08,620 --> 03:34:10,620
And die.

2745
03:34:10,620 --> 03:34:12,620
And then the next 500 people will

2746
03:34:12,620 --> 03:34:14,620
then know that that cannot

2747
03:34:14,620 --> 03:34:16,620
be accomplished.

2748
03:34:16,620 --> 03:34:18,620
Maybe it can. Maybe you can

2749
03:34:18,620 --> 03:34:20,620
sneak into the window in

2750
03:34:20,620 --> 03:34:22,620
my bathroom and break in and

2751
03:34:22,620 --> 03:34:24,620
shoot me with a bow and arrow. Which,

2752
03:34:24,620 --> 03:34:26,620
by the way, let's go over another thing.

2753
03:34:26,620 --> 03:34:28,620
I'm not even going to write this down because I can't.

2754
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:30,620
I'm useless.

2755
03:34:30,620 --> 03:34:33,120
Weapons. Oh, Jerma, I'm just going

2756
03:34:33,120 --> 03:34:35,120
to make an enchantment table and I'm going to make

2757
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:37,120
an enchanted bow and you're going to die in one click.

2758
03:34:37,120 --> 03:34:39,290
Nope. The only

2759
03:34:39,290 --> 03:34:41,290
available weapons are bows

2760
03:34:41,290 --> 03:34:46,799
and swords.

2761
03:34:46,799 --> 03:34:48,799
You cannot do that.

2762
03:34:48,799 --> 03:34:53,530
TNT is something we're still fighting

2763
03:34:53,530 --> 03:34:55,530
with to figure out if we're going to

2764
03:34:55,530 --> 03:34:57,530
do it immediately. Probably not immediately.

2765
03:34:57,530 --> 03:35:07,450
Just melee weapons

2766
03:35:07,450 --> 03:35:09,450
that make sense and ranged

2767
03:35:09,450 --> 03:35:11,450
weapons that make sense.

2768
03:35:11,450 --> 03:35:19,200
I might walk out the front door and get

2769
03:35:19,200 --> 03:35:22,780
exploded by a creeper. It's very

2770
03:35:22,780 --> 03:35:34,430
possible. Potions? Not yet.

2771
03:35:34,430 --> 03:35:36,430
No. Like I said, the first

2772
03:35:36,430 --> 03:35:38,430
stream of this is going to see

2773
03:35:38,430 --> 03:35:40,600
what happens when

2774
03:35:40,600 --> 03:35:42,600
500 plus people are told,

2775
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:44,600
hey, you live in a kingdom now and there's a

2776
03:35:44,600 --> 03:35:47,290
king in there. Go get him.

2777
03:35:47,290 --> 03:35:51,950
Or don't. Or don't.

2778
03:35:51,950 --> 03:35:55,280
Good luck. It's going to

2779
03:35:55,280 --> 03:36:00,270
be fucking calamity.

2780
03:36:00,270 --> 03:36:03,340
Can you live in the wilderness?

2781
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:10,639
Do whatever you want. Is there voice chat?

2782
03:36:10,639 --> 03:36:12,639
There's not going to be voice chat. That would be

2783
03:36:12,639 --> 03:36:16,409
impossible with 500 people.

2784
03:36:16,409 --> 03:36:18,409
This is very important. What Minecraft version?

2785
03:36:18,409 --> 03:36:20,649
The Minecraft version

2786
03:36:20,649 --> 03:36:22,649
is going to be 1.8.

2787
03:36:22,649 --> 03:36:28,479
It is not going to be on the new

2788
03:36:28,479 --> 03:36:32,889
Minecraft. I was told there's

2789
03:36:32,889 --> 03:36:34,889
a lot of, for having this many

2790
03:36:34,889 --> 03:36:39,120
people in a server, it's just

2791
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:41,120
not possible to have like 500

2792
03:36:41,120 --> 03:36:43,120
to 1,000 people in the same spot.

2793
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:46,120
It's just impossible.

2794
03:36:46,120 --> 03:36:50,399
We could have done maybe like

2795
03:36:50,399 --> 03:36:52,399
30 people, 50 people maybe.

2796
03:36:52,399 --> 03:36:55,979
What's your plan to get 500 people to sleep

2797
03:36:55,979 --> 03:36:57,979
at the same time? You don't have to sleep at the same time.

2798
03:36:57,979 --> 03:37:05,469
And also, let me, I got to make

2799
03:37:05,469 --> 03:37:07,469
sure that I'm saying this correctly. I think

2800
03:37:07,469 --> 03:37:09,469
once the server is live, it

2801
03:37:09,469 --> 03:37:11,469
won't matter what version you have. You'll just

2802
03:37:11,469 --> 03:37:13,469
connect to the server and it'll just run it

2803
03:37:13,469 --> 03:37:15,469
from what I've been told. So

2804
03:37:15,469 --> 03:37:17,469
I think it's going to be running on 1.8

2805
03:37:17,469 --> 03:37:19,469
but I don't think you need to have

2806
03:37:19,469 --> 03:37:22,799
somehow

2807
03:37:22,799 --> 03:37:24,799
1.8 something.

2808
03:37:24,799 --> 03:37:28,319
Doesn't work like that. I'm

2809
03:37:28,319 --> 03:37:33,120
completely wrong. Is there safe

2810
03:37:33,120 --> 03:37:36,639
areas? No. Can you

2811
03:37:36,639 --> 03:37:41,229
be guards? No.

2812
03:37:41,229 --> 03:37:43,229
Is chat going to be localized? Yes.

2813
03:37:43,229 --> 03:37:45,229
That's another thing. When you

2814
03:37:45,229 --> 03:37:47,229
talk, it is only going to be the

2815
03:37:47,229 --> 03:37:49,229
people that you are in the exact

2816
03:37:49,229 --> 03:37:51,229
vicinity of.

2817
03:37:51,229 --> 03:37:54,680
There is not a complete and total

2818
03:37:54,680 --> 03:37:58,590
always global chat. Can you be

2819
03:37:58,590 --> 03:38:00,590
promoted? Yes. I have the capability

2820
03:38:00,590 --> 03:38:02,590
to make anyone in the server anyone I want.

2821
03:38:02,590 --> 03:38:08,989
Does the hardcore death bar you from future

2822
03:38:08,989 --> 03:38:10,989
streams? Yes.

2823
03:38:10,989 --> 03:38:13,680
But, this is a very, very

2824
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:15,680
large, huge in quotations

2825
03:38:15,680 --> 03:38:20,989
but, we're going

2826
03:38:20,989 --> 03:38:22,989
to see how many people

2827
03:38:22,989 --> 03:38:24,989
are trying to join the server.

2828
03:38:24,989 --> 03:38:29,850
So, let's say for instance

2829
03:38:29,850 --> 03:38:32,350
after we do this once or twice

2830
03:38:32,350 --> 03:38:34,649
it's very clear that

2831
03:38:34,649 --> 03:38:36,649
there are no more players that can even

2832
03:38:36,649 --> 03:38:39,149
queue up. That's when we can be like

2833
03:38:39,149 --> 03:38:41,149
alright, it's from scratch, let's do

2834
03:38:41,149 --> 03:38:43,639
it again. But for the first stream or

2835
03:38:43,639 --> 03:38:45,639
two, no, it's permanent.

2836
03:38:45,639 --> 03:38:47,819
Because remember, here's another thing.

2837
03:38:47,819 --> 03:38:49,819
I might not die in the first stream.

2838
03:38:49,819 --> 03:38:53,340
We keep going. We keep going.

2839
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:56,860
We'll do it again next week. And

2840
03:38:56,860 --> 03:38:58,860
this is not a persistent server.

2841
03:38:58,860 --> 03:39:00,860
This is not a 24-7.

2842
03:39:00,860 --> 03:39:02,860
It's just on. No, no, no, this

2843
03:39:02,860 --> 03:39:04,860
server is only turned on when the stream

2844
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:06,860
exists. Everything is

2845
03:39:06,860 --> 03:39:08,860
saved. Everything is locked in.

2846
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:11,290
This is not a 24-hour

2847
03:39:11,290 --> 03:39:13,290
just Minecraft server that's going to exist. It's only

2848
03:39:13,290 --> 03:39:20,969
going to happen on the streams. How long

2849
03:39:20,969 --> 03:39:22,969
is the first stream going to be? I don't know.

2850
03:39:22,969 --> 03:39:26,239
It's up to, because

2851
03:39:26,239 --> 03:39:28,239
of how many people are involved, because remember

2852
03:39:28,239 --> 03:39:30,239
there's three or four cameramen.

2853
03:39:30,239 --> 03:39:32,239
There's two or three server

2854
03:39:32,239 --> 03:39:34,239
admins. And there's a lot

2855
03:39:34,239 --> 03:39:36,239
of people that are in a lot of moving parts.

2856
03:39:36,239 --> 03:39:38,239
So I would say this stream would be like

2857
03:39:38,239 --> 03:39:40,239
up to probably two to four hours.

2858
03:39:40,239 --> 03:39:42,239
It's not going to be

2859
03:39:42,239 --> 03:39:44,239
more than the first one. We'll do it in like

2860
03:39:44,239 --> 03:39:46,479
three to four hour chunks.

2861
03:39:46,479 --> 03:39:48,479
Potentially like I'd say up to four plus maybe

2862
03:39:48,479 --> 03:39:50,479
five hours total.

2863
03:39:50,479 --> 03:39:52,479
Because there's a lot of people involved and there's obviously

2864
03:39:52,479 --> 03:39:57,600
a lot of their time. So how do you

2865
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:59,600
replace AFK players? That's a great question.

2866
03:39:59,600 --> 03:40:01,600
I'll bring that up with the, for the next

2867
03:40:01,600 --> 03:40:03,600
three days, this is all I'm doing.

2868
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:06,219
So I, like, this is the only

2869
03:40:06,219 --> 03:40:08,219
thing I'm doing for the next two, three straight days until

2870
03:40:08,219 --> 03:40:10,219
the stream. So I will

2871
03:40:10,219 --> 03:40:12,219
bring that up and it will probably have a certain time limit when

2872
03:40:12,219 --> 03:40:14,219
they get booted and it brings another person in.

2873
03:40:14,219 --> 03:40:21,709
Feeling you can die in the first hour?

2874
03:40:21,709 --> 03:40:24,510
Possible. Very possible.

2875
03:40:24,510 --> 03:40:26,510
Do I die at a hundred? Yes.

2876
03:40:26,510 --> 03:40:31,370
I could just die in the throne

2877
03:40:31,370 --> 03:40:35,149
room at old age. I could

2878
03:40:35,149 --> 03:40:37,149
just be sitting in the throne room and be ninety-nine.

2879
03:40:37,149 --> 03:40:41,049
You didn't get me.

2880
03:40:41,049 --> 03:40:43,049
You'll never kill me. And then I'm just going to start

2881
03:40:43,049 --> 03:40:45,049
burning like money and food

2882
03:40:45,049 --> 03:40:48,190
and shit. I'm going to be buried with

2883
03:40:48,190 --> 03:40:50,489
the stakes. No, no, no. I don't want to give up

2884
03:40:50,489 --> 03:40:52,489
funny, funny fucking scenarios.

2885
03:40:52,489 --> 03:41:03,629
How are you, are you a

2886
03:41:03,629 --> 03:41:05,629
zero-year-old baby king? No.

2887
03:41:05,629 --> 03:41:07,799
I start, I age

2888
03:41:07,799 --> 03:41:09,799
slower. Not by very much, but I do

2889
03:41:09,799 --> 03:41:12,239
age slower. But I do

2890
03:41:12,239 --> 03:41:14,239
start at a normal, like

2891
03:41:14,239 --> 03:41:16,239
twenty, twenty-five.

2892
03:41:16,239 --> 03:41:18,239
Something like that. Just so I can actually move around. I'm not going to be

2893
03:41:18,239 --> 03:41:20,239
a baby king.

2894
03:41:20,239 --> 03:41:22,239
Who's going to take care of the babies?

2895
03:41:22,239 --> 03:41:24,670
I don't know. Maybe you.

2896
03:41:24,670 --> 03:41:26,969
Maybe you'll take care of the babies.

2897
03:41:26,969 --> 03:41:30,430
Maybe you should make that your thing

2898
03:41:30,430 --> 03:41:34,520
that you do. But

2899
03:41:34,520 --> 03:41:36,520
Jerma, we're going to kill you in five minutes.

2900
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:38,829
Sure you're not just going to kill each other?

2901
03:41:38,829 --> 03:41:43,500
Jerma's going to die in ten minutes.

2902
03:41:43,500 --> 03:41:52,459
You think so?

2903
03:41:52,459 --> 03:41:54,459
This, I already know

2904
03:41:54,459 --> 03:41:56,459
it's going to happen. And I don't

2905
03:41:56,459 --> 03:41:58,459
even need to say it because you all know. The first

2906
03:41:58,459 --> 03:42:00,459
ten minutes of this is happening.

2907
03:42:00,459 --> 03:42:03,469
Two hundred of you are just

2908
03:42:03,469 --> 03:42:05,469
going to be as zero-year-olds.

2909
03:42:05,469 --> 03:42:08,670
Just go storm the gate. And

2910
03:42:08,670 --> 03:42:11,790
we, and then we just freed up

2911
03:42:11,790 --> 03:42:13,790
two hundred more spots on the server. So

2912
03:42:13,790 --> 03:42:15,790
just be aware.

2913
03:42:15,790 --> 03:42:17,790
You're going to zero-rush.

2914
03:42:17,790 --> 03:42:19,790
Maybe it'll work.

2915
03:42:19,790 --> 03:42:24,270
If you leave the server

2916
03:42:24,270 --> 03:42:32,329
or you crash, we'll use the, yeah, it's

2917
03:42:32,329 --> 03:42:34,329
not tied to me.

2918
03:42:34,329 --> 03:42:37,209
Every time we stream this, there's going

2919
03:42:37,209 --> 03:42:39,209
to be a couple people who are going to be running

2920
03:42:39,209 --> 03:42:41,209
the show in the background that are running

2921
03:42:41,209 --> 03:42:43,209
the server. And they can help with problems.

2922
03:42:43,209 --> 03:42:45,209
They can fix things that happen if I crash.

2923
03:42:45,209 --> 03:42:47,209
It doesn't just, if I, oh, the stream

2924
03:42:47,209 --> 03:42:49,209
crashed. Oh, it's over.

2925
03:42:49,209 --> 03:42:51,770
Like, it'll still exist.

2926
03:42:51,770 --> 03:42:53,770
We can pause it. I can come back.

2927
03:42:53,770 --> 03:42:55,770
There'll be somebody on call that's taking

2928
03:42:55,770 --> 03:43:05,629
care of it. If you live for ten hours

2929
03:43:05,629 --> 03:43:07,629
and there's three hour streams, then you can do it

2930
03:43:07,629 --> 03:43:09,629
for three streams. There's also,

2931
03:43:09,629 --> 03:43:12,440
it might

2932
03:43:12,440 --> 03:43:14,440
not be ten hours. We can make that whatever

2933
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:16,879
we want. I can make that six,

2934
03:43:16,879 --> 03:43:18,879
right? You make that six, seven, five.

2935
03:43:18,879 --> 03:43:21,049
If a player crashes, can they

2936
03:43:21,049 --> 03:43:23,049
reconnect? Yes. There's going to

2937
03:43:23,049 --> 03:43:25,049
be a certain time frame when you can come back.

2938
03:43:25,049 --> 03:43:30,299
Do you have to worry about dying as a baby

2939
03:43:30,299 --> 03:43:40,729
from an older player? Yes.

2940
03:43:40,729 --> 03:43:48,909
But, just be aware,

2941
03:43:48,909 --> 03:43:50,909
if you are just causing

2942
03:43:50,909 --> 03:43:53,850
problems, it's real

2943
03:43:53,850 --> 03:43:56,540
easy to get rid of you.

2944
03:43:56,540 --> 03:43:58,540
I am going to have at least a

2945
03:43:58,540 --> 03:44:00,540
dozen people that are in the

2946
03:44:00,540 --> 03:44:02,540
best armor times two

2947
03:44:02,540 --> 03:44:05,360
in the whole game and are

2948
03:44:05,360 --> 03:44:07,790
stronger than you.

2949
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:09,790
They're coming

2950
03:44:09,790 --> 03:44:18,489
for you. We've also,

2951
03:44:18,489 --> 03:44:20,489
there's also the idea

2952
03:44:20,489 --> 03:44:22,489
that maybe, for the

2953
03:44:22,489 --> 03:44:24,489
first five, the first

2954
03:44:24,489 --> 03:44:26,489
year of your life, maybe you're in

2955
03:44:26,489 --> 03:44:28,489
invincible to other players.

2956
03:44:28,489 --> 03:44:31,760
That's another idea that I'm

2957
03:44:31,760 --> 03:44:33,930
going to throw out to them. That maybe

2958
03:44:33,930 --> 03:44:35,930
for almost like a spawn

2959
03:44:35,930 --> 03:44:38,559
protection kind of way.

2960
03:44:38,559 --> 03:44:40,559
So the first fifteen, twenty minutes

2961
03:44:40,559 --> 03:44:42,559
that you're in the game, you can't be killed

2962
03:44:42,559 --> 03:44:44,559
by another player. You can still

2963
03:44:44,559 --> 03:44:46,559
die from the environment maybe, but I don't know.

2964
03:44:46,559 --> 03:44:48,559
We might just see what happens.

2965
03:44:48,559 --> 03:44:50,559
I want to do this more than once. I want to do this more than

2966
03:44:50,559 --> 03:44:52,559
twice. I want to do this at least

2967
03:44:52,559 --> 03:44:54,559
a few times. I think it's a really, really

2968
03:44:54,559 --> 03:44:56,559
just fun idea. I do.

2969
03:44:56,559 --> 03:45:04,170
Baby Rush with invincibility.

2970
03:45:04,170 --> 03:45:09,229
Will you be okay with people streaming

2971
03:45:09,229 --> 03:45:11,979
it?

2972
03:45:11,979 --> 03:45:14,860
I guess. I don't

2973
03:45:14,860 --> 03:45:17,420
see why not.

2974
03:45:17,420 --> 03:45:19,850
The thing about

2975
03:45:19,850 --> 03:45:21,850
if you were to like play and stream,

2976
03:45:21,850 --> 03:45:23,850
the camera angles will be

2977
03:45:23,850 --> 03:45:25,850
that would just be your perspective.

2978
03:45:25,850 --> 03:45:28,459
Yes, it's the Java

2979
03:45:28,459 --> 03:45:30,459
Minecraft. It's the Java Minecraft.

2980
03:45:30,459 --> 03:45:36,030
Not the Microsoft one.

2981
03:45:36,030 --> 03:45:38,329
Is there a reward for someone that kills you?

2982
03:45:38,329 --> 03:45:40,329
Yes, you turned off the stream.

2983
03:45:40,329 --> 03:45:44,040
That's your reward. If we all start as

2984
03:45:44,040 --> 03:45:46,040
babies, who takes care of us?

2985
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:48,219
I don't know.

2986
03:45:48,219 --> 03:45:50,399
Ask the cavemen.

2987
03:45:50,399 --> 03:45:56,479
How did they do it?

2988
03:45:56,479 --> 03:45:58,479
How did the first man? I don't know.

2989
03:45:58,479 --> 03:46:04,559
Figure it out. You have to take care

2990
03:46:04,559 --> 03:46:08,459
of each other.

2991
03:46:08,459 --> 03:46:10,459
Here's another thing that I was thinking.

2992
03:46:10,459 --> 03:46:12,459
Remember, this is all not set in stone.

2993
03:46:12,459 --> 03:46:14,459
The other thing that I was thinking is

2994
03:46:14,459 --> 03:46:17,020
have some designated

2995
03:46:17,020 --> 03:46:19,020
community members

2996
03:46:19,020 --> 03:46:21,020
that are not just

2997
03:46:21,020 --> 03:46:23,020
going to kill everybody.

2998
03:46:23,020 --> 03:46:25,020
That can be trusted.

2999
03:46:25,020 --> 03:46:27,020
That will just be

3000
03:46:27,020 --> 03:46:29,020
like 10,

3001
03:46:29,020 --> 03:46:33,370
15.

3002
03:46:33,370 --> 03:46:36,319
And that's it. But you can still eat

3003
03:46:36,319 --> 03:46:38,319
and move.

3004
03:46:38,319 --> 03:46:40,319
Remember, when you see

3005
03:46:40,319 --> 03:46:42,319
like the, oh, I'm zero years old.

3006
03:46:42,319 --> 03:46:44,319
That's just essentially your time

3007
03:46:44,319 --> 03:46:46,319
in the server.

3008
03:46:46,319 --> 03:46:49,319
So you can still do things.

3009
03:46:49,319 --> 03:46:51,319
You can still move around, but you just can't talk.

3010
03:46:51,319 --> 03:46:53,319
It actually scrambles your

3011
03:46:53,319 --> 03:46:55,319
text like it does in games like

3012
03:46:55,319 --> 03:46:57,319
World of Warcraft. If you are a baby

3013
03:46:57,319 --> 03:46:59,319
and you write something for the first 20 minutes,

3014
03:46:59,319 --> 03:47:01,319
it literally is ineligible.

3015
03:47:08,040 --> 03:47:14,569
So it's basically one hour.

3016
03:47:14,569 --> 03:47:17,069
I would like it to be more than five hours

3017
03:47:17,069 --> 03:47:19,069
in server, in game, for a whole

3018
03:47:19,069 --> 03:47:21,069
life. Between five and ten, we're still trying to

3019
03:47:21,069 --> 03:47:30,989
figure it out. But there'd be a thing that hides

3020
03:47:30,989 --> 03:47:34,250
player name tags. Not sure

3021
03:47:34,250 --> 03:47:36,250
yet. Not sure yet. There's going to

3022
03:47:36,250 --> 03:47:38,250
be a HUD. There's going to be a little HUD

3023
03:47:38,250 --> 03:47:40,250
that'll show you your current

3024
03:47:40,250 --> 03:47:42,250
title, your current name, your

3025
03:47:42,250 --> 03:47:44,250
your current health. You'll

3026
03:47:44,250 --> 03:47:46,250
have a little HUD in the corner.

3027
03:47:46,250 --> 03:47:51,950
When is the server going to become available?

3028
03:47:51,950 --> 03:47:55,399
It is not

3029
03:47:55,399 --> 03:47:57,399
ready. The town

3030
03:47:57,399 --> 03:47:59,399
is still being built right now.

3031
03:47:59,399 --> 03:48:01,840
So it's not going to be ready

3032
03:48:01,840 --> 03:48:03,840
till the day that we do it.

3033
03:48:03,840 --> 03:48:06,459
But

3034
03:48:06,459 --> 03:48:08,459
for testing purposes,

3035
03:48:08,459 --> 03:48:11,149
obviously, I might

3036
03:48:11,149 --> 03:48:13,149
pull in some people, like a few.

3037
03:48:13,149 --> 03:48:15,149
Maybe like the day before

3038
03:48:15,149 --> 03:48:17,149
or like the day of,

3039
03:48:17,149 --> 03:48:19,389
like in the morning. We don't get to build?

3040
03:48:19,389 --> 03:48:22,590
Yes, you can. There's

3041
03:48:22,590 --> 03:48:24,590
a whole town that's being

3042
03:48:24,590 --> 03:48:28,489
built right now. It looks awesome.

3043
03:48:28,489 --> 03:48:35,149
It looks unbelievable. Where do you guys

3044
03:48:35,149 --> 03:48:38,409
see this town? Do we own property?

3045
03:48:38,409 --> 03:48:41,159
Not immediately.

3046
03:48:41,159 --> 03:48:43,159
Remember, this is a very

3047
03:48:43,159 --> 03:48:45,159
this whole thing is just a

3048
03:48:45,159 --> 03:48:47,159
alpha like 0.5.

3049
03:48:47,159 --> 03:48:49,600
It's very much an experiment

3050
03:48:49,600 --> 03:48:51,600
in work in progress right now.

3051
03:48:51,600 --> 03:48:54,159
What is available right now

3052
03:48:54,159 --> 03:48:56,159
is getting all the people there, having the

3053
03:48:56,159 --> 03:48:58,159
age system in place, having the

3054
03:48:58,159 --> 03:49:00,159
people, the amount of people that we want,

3055
03:49:00,159 --> 03:49:02,159
having the stamina bar in the food,

3056
03:49:02,159 --> 03:49:04,159
and having the town.

3057
03:49:04,159 --> 03:49:06,159
And having the outside.

3058
03:49:06,159 --> 03:49:08,159
Those of you saying, well, can I like

3059
03:49:08,159 --> 03:49:10,159
own property outside

3060
03:49:10,159 --> 03:49:12,159
the town? Yeah, this is going to be just a whole

3061
03:49:12,159 --> 03:49:14,159
area that's kind of just

3062
03:49:14,159 --> 03:49:16,159
to whatever. It's going to be, you can do

3063
03:49:16,159 --> 03:49:18,159
whatever you want. But it's also going to take

3064
03:49:18,159 --> 03:49:20,159
more materials

3065
03:49:20,159 --> 03:49:22,159
to build. When I say materials, you have a stamina bar,

3066
03:49:22,159 --> 03:49:24,159
right? So you can't just

3067
03:49:24,159 --> 03:49:26,159
build dirt everywhere.

3068
03:49:26,159 --> 03:49:28,159
You can't just, oh, I'm going to pick this up and make a

3069
03:49:28,159 --> 03:49:30,159
giant like dirt dick.

3070
03:49:30,159 --> 03:49:32,159
That's impossible because you'd have

3071
03:49:32,159 --> 03:49:37,719
to have stamina to build.

3072
03:49:37,719 --> 03:49:39,719
It costs stamina for you to place a block.

3073
03:49:39,719 --> 03:49:42,860
Let's just put it that way. So you guys are going to

3074
03:49:42,860 --> 03:49:44,860
have to work together to build houses. You can't

3075
03:49:44,860 --> 03:49:46,860
just make a dirt dick. It's not going to happen.

3076
03:49:46,860 --> 03:49:48,860
You could, I guess,

3077
03:49:48,860 --> 03:49:50,860
you could pick your little spot in the wilderness and make a dirt

3078
03:49:50,860 --> 03:49:52,860
dick. But that's going to take you

3079
03:49:52,860 --> 03:49:54,860
like your whole life.

3080
03:49:54,860 --> 03:50:05,790
Don't give them ideas.

3081
03:50:05,790 --> 03:50:07,790
It's worth it.

3082
03:50:07,790 --> 03:50:09,790
My whole life

3083
03:50:09,790 --> 03:50:11,790
was dedicated to making a dirt

3084
03:50:11,790 --> 03:50:13,790
dick.

3085
03:50:13,790 --> 03:50:15,790
I can rest peacefully now.

3086
03:50:15,790 --> 03:50:26,920
There's ideas to eventually

3087
03:50:26,920 --> 03:50:28,920
add. And pretty much what you see

3088
03:50:28,920 --> 03:50:31,290
on the screen right now

3089
03:50:31,290 --> 03:50:33,290
is what the stream will be

3090
03:50:33,290 --> 03:50:35,790
at first. Once we get one

3091
03:50:35,790 --> 03:50:37,790
under the belt, there's going to be so much data

3092
03:50:37,790 --> 03:50:39,790
that we'll have to do it

3093
03:50:39,790 --> 03:50:41,790
again. We'll learn

3094
03:50:41,790 --> 03:50:43,790
so much from the first one.

3095
03:50:43,790 --> 03:50:47,120
We'll just keep it moving forward.

3096
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:49,799
There's nothing for us to install.

3097
03:50:49,799 --> 03:50:52,239
Nope. There, you do not have

3098
03:50:52,239 --> 03:50:54,239
to get any mods. You do not have to get

3099
03:50:54,239 --> 03:50:56,239
anything special. You just have to

3100
03:50:56,239 --> 03:51:04,559
go in the server. Entering

3101
03:51:04,559 --> 03:51:06,559
the server will be putting in the

3102
03:51:06,559 --> 03:51:09,049
server IP.

3103
03:51:09,049 --> 03:51:11,719
Right? Like always.

3104
03:51:11,719 --> 03:51:14,090
Once you get in, you will be

3105
03:51:14,090 --> 03:51:16,590
in a separate little lobby, which you

3106
03:51:16,590 --> 03:51:18,590
will then have. It isn't going to be

3107
03:51:18,590 --> 03:51:20,590
a separate website that's going

3108
03:51:20,590 --> 03:51:22,590
to generate a code for you. It's going to check

3109
03:51:22,590 --> 03:51:24,590
to see how many months you've been subbed

3110
03:51:24,590 --> 03:51:27,530
to the channel. Completely separated.

3111
03:51:27,530 --> 03:51:30,409
It'll see.

3112
03:51:30,409 --> 03:51:32,409
You'll get a code. Put it in.

3113
03:51:32,409 --> 03:51:34,409
Very simple.

3114
03:51:34,409 --> 03:51:39,340
There you go. Can we make our own kingdom

3115
03:51:39,340 --> 03:51:41,340
next door? Sure, but I'll just come destroy

3116
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:45,239
it. Does it have to be an active

3117
03:51:45,239 --> 03:51:49,979
sub? Yes. If you guys

3118
03:51:49,979 --> 03:51:51,979
go make your own kingdom, are you going to make your own

3119
03:51:51,979 --> 03:51:54,409
kingdom? I don't think so. There's only

3120
03:51:54,409 --> 03:51:56,409
one kingdom here. Me.

3121
03:51:56,409 --> 03:52:00,120
I will squash this

3122
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:02,120
rebellion. If you do one, I will just

3123
03:52:02,120 --> 03:52:11,600
squash it. We're going to rise

3124
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:15,120
up. Are you though? Because

3125
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:17,120
there, I'm not going to be a bad king.

3126
03:52:17,120 --> 03:52:19,680
I'm going to come

3127
03:52:19,680 --> 03:52:21,680
out and talk to the people

3128
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:24,809
and there'll be events. There are going

3129
03:52:24,809 --> 03:52:26,809
to be events planned where, you know, we

3130
03:52:26,809 --> 03:52:28,809
go and check out the garden that's being built

3131
03:52:28,809 --> 03:52:33,159
and created. You just said

3132
03:52:33,159 --> 03:52:35,159
I'm going to be a very fair king.

3133
03:52:35,159 --> 03:52:37,159
Are you going to get poisoned? No, I will

3134
03:52:37,159 --> 03:52:39,159
not. There's going to be ten people in front of me that will eat

3135
03:52:39,159 --> 03:52:47,229
before I do. I'm going

3136
03:52:47,229 --> 03:52:49,229
to have a stash of a hundred steaks.

3137
03:52:49,229 --> 03:52:51,399
The first ten are going to be eaten

3138
03:52:51,399 --> 03:52:53,399
by my royal kingsguard

3139
03:52:53,399 --> 03:52:55,399
and then I'll eat the eleventh one

3140
03:52:55,399 --> 03:52:57,399
to make sure it's not poisoned.

3141
03:52:57,399 --> 03:53:06,090
How's sleeping going to work?

3142
03:53:06,090 --> 03:53:08,329
So, sleeping,

3143
03:53:08,329 --> 03:53:10,889
you can refill your stamina by sleeping

3144
03:53:10,889 --> 03:53:12,889
and also eating. You'll be

3145
03:53:12,889 --> 03:53:15,129
doing it mostly by eating.

3146
03:53:15,129 --> 03:53:17,129
But if you lie down in a bed,

3147
03:53:17,129 --> 03:53:20,909
you will recharge at a very fast rate.

3148
03:53:20,909 --> 03:53:22,909
But you have to lie there

3149
03:53:22,909 --> 03:53:24,909
for at least a minute or two.

3150
03:53:24,909 --> 03:53:26,909
You have to lie facing up to the ceiling

3151
03:53:26,909 --> 03:53:28,909
for like a full sixty seconds.

3152
03:53:28,909 --> 03:53:31,920
Potentially up to two minutes.

3153
03:53:31,920 --> 03:53:35,370
Just lie down

3154
03:53:35,370 --> 03:53:38,250
for like two years.

3155
03:53:38,250 --> 03:53:47,469
You have to determine what you want

3156
03:53:47,469 --> 03:53:52,139
to do for time. No, not everyone

3157
03:53:52,139 --> 03:53:54,139
has to sleep at once. It can be tied

3158
03:53:54,139 --> 03:53:56,139
to just the person's ID. That's not

3159
03:53:56,139 --> 03:53:59,020
a problem. Until we're strong enough

3160
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:06,829
to kill. Just sleep your whole

3161
03:54:06,829 --> 03:54:08,829
life. You could do that if you wanted to.

3162
03:54:08,829 --> 03:54:10,829
You could spawn in

3163
03:54:10,829 --> 03:54:13,579
as a baby, slowly

3164
03:54:13,579 --> 03:54:15,579
with four or five other babies, build

3165
03:54:15,579 --> 03:54:17,579
a small baby house,

3166
03:54:17,579 --> 03:54:19,579
make a bed, and lie

3167
03:54:19,579 --> 03:54:29,049
in it until you die. You can

3168
03:54:29,049 --> 03:54:31,799
sleep at any time. It's just simply

3169
03:54:31,799 --> 03:54:33,799
a way to make you have to

3170
03:54:33,799 --> 03:54:36,940
not participate.

3171
03:54:36,940 --> 03:54:39,309
You know what I'm saying?

3172
03:54:39,309 --> 03:54:41,309
If you lie down, if a bunch of people

3173
03:54:41,309 --> 03:54:43,309
have to lie down for sixty seconds,

3174
03:54:43,309 --> 03:54:45,309
two minutes, that's not time that you're

3175
03:54:45,309 --> 03:54:47,309
storming the front gates

3176
03:54:47,309 --> 03:54:49,309
with your knives.

3177
03:54:49,309 --> 03:54:51,610
You've got to play by the rules.

3178
03:54:51,610 --> 03:54:53,610
If you have zero stamina,

3179
03:54:53,610 --> 03:54:55,610
you can still move around. That's fine.

3180
03:54:55,610 --> 03:54:58,110
You can still walk, you can still

3181
03:54:58,110 --> 03:55:00,110
punch, you can still grab, you can still

3182
03:55:00,110 --> 03:55:02,110
build. You just do it at a

3183
03:55:02,110 --> 03:55:04,110
times five slower rate.

3184
03:55:04,110 --> 03:55:06,409
You could be walking on at zero stamina

3185
03:55:06,409 --> 03:55:08,409
and you swing at minus two hundred percent speed.

3186
03:55:08,409 --> 03:55:17,239
What's the point of the server of when you die

3187
03:55:17,239 --> 03:55:19,239
within the first hour? That's not going to

3188
03:55:19,239 --> 03:55:21,739
happen. You guys don't know the things

3189
03:55:21,739 --> 03:55:24,299
that I know. I know a lot of things.

3190
03:55:24,299 --> 03:55:27,049
That's not going to happen.

3191
03:55:27,049 --> 03:55:30,440
There is no chance in hell

3192
03:55:30,440 --> 03:55:32,440
that I die in the first hour of the stream.

3193
03:55:32,440 --> 03:55:34,440
Not a chance in hell.

3194
03:55:34,440 --> 03:55:37,200
You guys are going to be babies.

3195
03:55:37,200 --> 03:55:40,780
What, you're going to surround me?

3196
03:55:40,780 --> 03:55:42,780
Five hundred babies are going to surround

3197
03:55:42,780 --> 03:55:44,959
the castle? That's not

3198
03:55:44,959 --> 03:55:46,959
going to happen. I can

3199
03:55:46,959 --> 03:55:48,959
see it. I could look out my window

3200
03:55:48,959 --> 03:55:50,959
and see

3201
03:55:50,959 --> 03:55:52,959
the baby zerg rush

3202
03:55:52,959 --> 03:56:07,680
and know what's going to happen.

3203
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:09,680
Is it going to be a two beat?

3204
03:56:09,680 --> 03:56:11,680
I don't know what that style queue. I don't know what that means.

3205
03:56:11,680 --> 03:56:13,680
This, the queue system,

3206
03:56:13,680 --> 03:56:15,680
the server, it's being handled by

3207
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:17,680
incredibly competent people.

3208
03:56:17,680 --> 03:56:20,299
So there, they know exactly

3209
03:56:20,299 --> 03:56:22,299
what they're doing. This

3210
03:56:22,299 --> 03:56:24,299
is not the first time they've done large

3211
03:56:24,299 --> 03:56:26,299
scale servers.

3212
03:56:26,299 --> 03:56:28,299
They have a lot of experience. So

3213
03:56:28,299 --> 03:56:30,299
they, I'm assuming, if it's something

3214
03:56:30,299 --> 03:56:33,239
that would be good,

3215
03:56:33,239 --> 03:56:37,600
it's there. They actually are very,

3216
03:56:37,600 --> 03:56:39,600
very highly qualified. We'll just put

3217
03:56:39,600 --> 03:56:48,430
that way. Imagine the lag.

3218
03:56:48,430 --> 03:56:50,430
That's another thing that we've already talked about, that we've

3219
03:56:50,430 --> 03:56:52,600
already figured out. There is

3220
03:56:52,600 --> 03:56:54,600
going to be selective rendering.

3221
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:56,909
So if you are

3222
03:56:56,909 --> 03:56:58,909
standing in your house,

3223
03:56:58,909 --> 03:57:00,909
you are not going to render

3224
03:57:00,909 --> 03:57:03,719
what's happening at the castle

3225
03:57:03,719 --> 03:57:05,719
because you don't have to.

3226
03:57:05,719 --> 03:57:14,809
Do the kings go get fancy outfits? Of course

3227
03:57:14,809 --> 03:57:19,610
they do. That's default to

3228
03:57:19,610 --> 03:57:21,610
Minecraft. Yeah, see?

3229
03:57:21,610 --> 03:57:35,629
How will redstone work? I don't think there's going to be redstone.

3230
03:57:35,629 --> 03:57:44,649
There's actually

3231
03:57:44,649 --> 03:57:46,649
talk of being able to not render

3232
03:57:46,649 --> 03:57:48,649
people that are under two or three years

3233
03:57:48,649 --> 03:57:51,920
old, if the server

3234
03:57:51,920 --> 03:57:54,799
load gets too big. There's a lot

3235
03:57:54,799 --> 03:57:56,799
of stuff, and these are very powerful

3236
03:57:56,799 --> 03:58:02,940
servers too. Like I said,

3237
03:58:02,940 --> 03:58:04,940
this is, this is not,

3238
03:58:04,940 --> 03:58:06,940
I didn't just go to servers.com

3239
03:58:06,940 --> 03:58:09,819
and buy one.

3240
03:58:09,819 --> 03:58:11,819
They're very, very, very powerful servers.

3241
03:58:11,819 --> 03:58:20,079
Invisible ghost

3242
03:58:20,079 --> 03:58:22,959
baby rush. Is there a

3243
03:58:22,959 --> 03:58:24,959
currency? No. That's something that we might

3244
03:58:24,959 --> 03:58:27,639
want to do eventually though. Remember,

3245
03:58:27,639 --> 03:58:29,639
it has to work

3246
03:58:29,639 --> 03:58:31,639
first. It has to work.

3247
03:58:31,639 --> 03:58:33,639
And this was just based off of

3248
03:58:33,639 --> 03:58:35,639
some just stupid idea

3249
03:58:35,639 --> 03:58:37,639
about World of Warcraft and not doing

3250
03:58:37,639 --> 03:58:39,639
anything and just having people play the game around

3251
03:58:39,639 --> 03:58:42,329
me. And it just, it

3252
03:58:42,329 --> 03:58:45,020
became a stream. This is just

3253
03:58:45,020 --> 03:58:47,020
we, I gotta, I gotta paddle

3254
03:58:47,020 --> 03:58:49,020
right now. And I'm just kind of

3255
03:58:49,020 --> 03:58:51,020
paddling around somewhere in water that I've

3256
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:57,610
never been in. I think this is

3257
03:58:57,610 --> 03:59:04,520
going to be a lot of fun. And expect

3258
03:59:04,520 --> 03:59:06,700
after the first one,

3259
03:59:06,700 --> 03:59:08,700
for some of the, I see a lot of people saying,

3260
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:10,700
hey, what about this? What about

3261
03:59:10,700 --> 03:59:12,700
the currency? What about, what

3262
03:59:12,700 --> 03:59:15,639
are the titles going to do? In the

3263
03:59:15,639 --> 03:59:17,639
future we will have lots of things.

3264
03:59:17,639 --> 03:59:21,420
It does have a lot of potential.

3265
03:59:21,420 --> 03:59:24,170
Okay, I will just say this.

3266
03:59:24,170 --> 03:59:26,170
It will be worth,

3267
03:59:26,170 --> 03:59:28,799
it will be worth doing once.

3268
03:59:28,799 --> 03:59:30,799
Just to see what happens.

3269
03:59:30,799 --> 03:59:35,200
And that's worth it to me.

3270
03:59:35,200 --> 03:59:37,200
Regardless of how

3271
03:59:37,200 --> 03:59:39,200
time intensive, how many people are

3272
03:59:39,200 --> 03:59:41,200
involved, how much money or resources,

3273
03:59:41,200 --> 03:59:43,200
I think it's just worth trying. It should

3274
03:59:43,200 --> 03:59:51,260
be fun. I'm pogging

3275
03:59:51,260 --> 03:59:58,559
so fucking hard right now.

3276
03:59:58,559 --> 04:00:00,559
I refuse to let this die after one

3277
04:00:00,559 --> 04:00:08,489
attempt. What's the kingdom's

3278
04:00:08,489 --> 04:00:10,489
name? That's something I haven't

3279
04:00:10,489 --> 04:00:13,950
even thought of. I don't know.

3280
04:00:13,950 --> 04:00:18,040
I have to think about that.

3281
04:00:18,040 --> 04:00:22,969
Germacraft. We'll figure that out.

3282
04:00:22,969 --> 04:00:28,799
But the next thing that you need to hear

3283
04:00:28,799 --> 04:00:31,420
is, when Sunday

3284
04:00:31,420 --> 04:00:34,110
comes along, the

3285
04:00:34,110 --> 04:00:36,110
stream is going to be starting, I believe, at about

3286
04:00:36,110 --> 04:00:39,049
4pm Pacific. We

3287
04:00:39,049 --> 04:00:41,049
still haven't locked that down 100%, but

3288
04:00:41,049 --> 04:00:43,049
it doesn't really matter, because

3289
04:00:43,049 --> 04:00:45,049
the first

3290
04:00:45,049 --> 04:00:47,049
at least

3291
04:00:47,049 --> 04:00:49,680
two to three hours

3292
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:51,680
before it, and the first hour

3293
04:00:51,680 --> 04:00:53,680
of the stream being live, we're

3294
04:00:53,680 --> 04:00:55,680
going to be getting people in position to start.

3295
04:00:55,680 --> 04:00:58,239
This is not going to be a case of

3296
04:00:58,239 --> 04:01:00,239
okay, the stream is on,

3297
04:01:00,239 --> 04:01:02,600
okay, let's go, get in the server, let's go.

3298
04:01:02,600 --> 04:01:05,290
Are you guys ready? No,

3299
04:01:05,290 --> 04:01:07,290
this is going to be at least an hour

3300
04:01:07,290 --> 04:01:11,840
of getting people in.

3301
04:01:11,840 --> 04:01:20,350
This is on Sunday, Sunday afternoon Pacific.

3302
04:01:20,350 --> 04:01:22,780
Sunday the 15th,

3303
04:01:22,780 --> 04:01:25,469
that's the next time you will see me live.

3304
04:01:25,469 --> 04:01:27,469
I will be around

3305
04:01:27,469 --> 04:01:29,469
in the Discord. If you are very interested

3306
04:01:29,469 --> 04:01:32,350
in this, hang out in the Discord

3307
04:01:32,350 --> 04:01:34,350
over the next couple of days, because I'm going to be

3308
04:01:34,350 --> 04:01:36,350
around for three days straight here.

3309
04:01:36,350 --> 04:01:38,350
I'll give updates, I will tell you guys

3310
04:01:38,350 --> 04:01:40,350
more things that are being added, maybe some

3311
04:01:40,350 --> 04:01:42,350
things that might have to change last second.

3312
04:01:42,350 --> 04:01:45,040
If you would like to keep up to date with

3313
04:01:45,040 --> 04:01:47,340
that, I'm just going to make another

3314
04:01:47,340 --> 04:01:49,709
channel. It's just going to be

3315
04:01:49,709 --> 04:01:51,709
FTK, and it's just going to be

3316
04:01:51,709 --> 04:01:53,709
just info, and if there's

3317
04:01:53,709 --> 04:01:55,709
any server info and stuff like that,

3318
04:01:55,709 --> 04:01:58,649
it'll be there. You're going to

3319
04:01:58,649 --> 04:02:02,239
leak the plans.

3320
04:02:02,239 --> 04:02:04,239
What is this?

3321
04:02:04,239 --> 04:02:07,739
Here's the attack plan.

3322
04:02:07,739 --> 04:02:11,200
Let's see what the attack plan is.

3323
04:02:11,200 --> 04:02:13,200
Swordsman and Archer's attack

3324
04:02:13,200 --> 04:02:15,200
term. Baby sword blocks retreat path.

3325
04:02:15,200 --> 04:02:23,840
Hold on a minute.

3326
04:02:23,840 --> 04:02:25,840
Let's go over this incredibly flawed

3327
04:02:25,840 --> 04:02:32,680
plan. What do you say? Okay, let's see.

3328
04:02:32,680 --> 04:02:41,129
Dermal walk path,

3329
04:02:41,129 --> 04:02:43,129
bait location. Swordsman are hiding

3330
04:02:43,129 --> 04:02:45,129
in the house as Archer is at the top.

3331
04:02:45,129 --> 04:02:47,129
Swordsman and Archer's attack term

3332
04:02:47,129 --> 04:02:49,129
of baby sword blocks retreat path and attack

3333
04:02:49,129 --> 04:02:51,129
run behind. Base of operation.

3334
04:02:51,129 --> 04:02:56,569
Yeah,

3335
04:02:56,569 --> 04:02:58,569
guys, do it. Do it.

3336
04:02:58,569 --> 04:03:03,360
Form alliances.

3337
04:03:03,360 --> 04:03:05,530
Make plans. Do it.

3338
04:03:05,530 --> 04:03:07,840
I really, really want you to.

3339
04:03:07,840 --> 04:03:13,209
Good luck.

3340
04:03:13,209 --> 04:03:21,659
You're going to need it. Dirt-dick alliance.

3341
04:03:25,120 --> 04:03:27,420
But, that's the plan.

3342
04:03:27,420 --> 04:03:30,239
Any other questions,

3343
04:03:30,239 --> 04:03:32,989
we will go over them in the

3344
04:03:32,989 --> 04:03:34,989
Discord. I just wanted to give a basic

3345
04:03:34,989 --> 04:03:38,379
understanding of how this is going to work. Is there a

3346
04:03:38,379 --> 04:03:40,379
jail? No. Not yet. Not on the first one.

3347
04:03:40,379 --> 04:03:45,049
Think of the first one as an

3348
04:03:45,049 --> 04:03:47,049
experiment, like I said before. It's

3349
04:03:47,049 --> 04:03:49,049
the first iteration of an alpha

3350
04:03:49,049 --> 04:03:53,340
essentially. And I'll see you guys

3351
04:03:53,340 --> 04:03:56,729
on Sunday. Good luck.

3352
04:03:56,729 --> 04:04:04,329
See you in the Discord possibly.

3353
04:04:04,329 --> 04:04:08,110
And that's going to be it for me. Be

3354
04:04:08,110 --> 04:04:10,110
prepared. Oh, I've been preparing

3355
04:04:10,110 --> 04:04:12,110
for the last three,

3356
04:04:12,110 --> 04:04:15,879
four weeks. You don't, what, you don't

3357
04:04:15,879 --> 04:04:18,059
think that I,

3358
04:04:18,059 --> 04:04:20,059
you don't think that I have

3359
04:04:20,059 --> 04:04:22,059
some tricks up

3360
04:04:22,059 --> 04:04:24,059
my sleeve? What, I'm just,

3361
04:04:24,059 --> 04:04:26,059
I'm just going to die?

3362
04:04:26,059 --> 04:04:28,059
You don't think I have things

3363
04:04:28,059 --> 04:04:30,059
in place? You don't think I

3364
04:04:30,059 --> 04:04:32,059
have my own plans?

3365
04:04:32,059 --> 04:04:34,059
You don't think I know these things?

3366
04:04:34,059 --> 04:04:36,059
I ain't just going to let you

3367
04:04:36,059 --> 04:04:38,059
walk in the front door.

3368
04:04:38,059 --> 04:04:40,059
I ain't going to let you just come in the

3369
04:04:40,059 --> 04:04:43,319
back door. Not

3370
04:04:43,319 --> 04:04:47,719
going to happen. Good luck.

3371
04:04:47,719 --> 04:04:49,719
But I'll see you on Sunday. We'll give it

3372
04:04:49,719 --> 04:04:51,719
a try. That's the next time you'll see

3373
04:04:51,719 --> 04:04:56,270
me. Thanks for hanging out for the game awards.

3374
04:04:56,270 --> 04:04:59,659
Let's get some music on here, huh?

3375
04:04:59,659 --> 04:05:12,010
He's going to play self-destruct buttons.

3376
04:05:12,010 --> 04:05:21,530
Maybe. Thank you for watching.

3377
04:05:21,530 --> 04:05:25,760
See you Sunday. 4pm Pacific.

3378
04:05:25,760 --> 04:05:28,379
Great Canadian Fuck Club

3379
04:05:28,379 --> 04:05:30,379
thanks to the five community subs right now.

3380
04:05:30,379 --> 04:05:32,379
There was also, I think I saw,

3381
04:05:32,379 --> 04:05:34,379
yeah, Great Canadian Fuck Club gave 5000

3382
04:05:34,379 --> 04:05:36,379
bits on top of the subs.

3383
04:05:36,379 --> 04:05:38,559
$50 from

3384
04:05:38,559 --> 04:05:40,559
Great Canadian. Jerma, King of the Andals,

3385
04:05:40,559 --> 04:05:42,559
The Royner, and The Short Men.

3386
04:05:42,559 --> 04:05:48,000
Thank you,

3387
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:50,000
Great Canadian, for your massive

3388
04:05:50,000 --> 04:05:52,000
contribution here. Thank you.

3389
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:54,000
10, 20, 15

3390
04:05:54,000 --> 04:05:56,000
community subs at least.

3391
04:05:56,000 --> 04:06:05,770
And $50.

3392
04:06:05,770 --> 04:06:09,549
He's short. Splard, thanks

3393
04:06:09,549 --> 04:06:11,549
for the five community subs. I think we got it.

3394
04:06:11,549 --> 04:06:13,549
Freddy Dread gave $100 at the beginning of the stream.

3395
04:06:13,549 --> 04:06:16,170
Huge thank you.

3396
04:06:16,170 --> 04:06:20,010
Sad Vega, thanks for the 300 bits.

3397
04:06:20,010 --> 04:06:22,010
Death Stranding's soundtrack was comparable to Hipster

3398
04:06:22,010 --> 04:06:24,010
Kitchen Music. My God, they are going to win

3399
04:06:24,010 --> 04:06:26,010
so many undeserved rewards.

3400
04:06:26,010 --> 04:06:28,639
What is Hipster Kitchen

3401
04:06:28,639 --> 04:06:31,520
Music? I don't know, Kitchen

3402
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:34,909
Music was its own genre. The Dirt

3403
04:06:34,909 --> 04:06:40,479
Dick Alliance is coming for you.

3404
04:06:40,479 --> 04:06:44,379
Alright, well, fine.

3405
04:06:44,379 --> 04:06:49,819
Thank you, Maddie, for the

3406
04:06:49,819 --> 04:06:51,819
$5.30.

3407
04:06:51,819 --> 04:06:54,190
530 bits. Jerma, you're always going

3408
04:06:54,190 --> 04:06:56,190
to be my content creator of the year. There's no doubt

3409
04:06:56,190 --> 04:06:58,190
you make the world a brighter place. Thank you for

3410
04:06:58,190 --> 04:07:00,190
all the laughs. We all appreciate it more than you may think.

3411
04:07:00,190 --> 04:07:02,430
Love you.

3412
04:07:02,430 --> 04:07:06,270
Thank you, Maddie. I don't need any awards.

3413
04:07:06,270 --> 04:07:15,290
Appreciate that.

3414
04:07:15,290 --> 04:07:20,159
Thank you, Teypan,

3415
04:07:20,159 --> 04:07:22,159
for the 300 bits. 300 bits.

3416
04:07:22,159 --> 04:07:24,159
No message, just

3417
04:07:24,159 --> 04:07:26,159
three dollars. Thank you.

3418
04:07:26,159 --> 04:07:28,159
Sad Vega, thanks for 300 bits. My heart

3419
04:07:28,159 --> 04:07:30,159
broke hearing you say you will never play Luigi's Mansion 3.

3420
04:07:30,159 --> 04:07:33,040
My ADHD

3421
04:07:33,040 --> 04:07:35,040
and obsessive compulsive

3422
04:07:35,040 --> 04:07:37,040
nature makes me unable

3423
04:07:37,040 --> 04:07:43,239
to complete that game.

3424
04:07:43,239 --> 04:07:45,239
Malto, thanks for the 500 bits.

3425
04:07:45,239 --> 04:07:48,319
Thank you, Malto69.

3426
04:07:48,319 --> 04:07:50,319
Imagine a game so big it actually sells

3427
04:07:50,319 --> 04:07:52,319
as its own console to fit all its

3428
04:07:52,319 --> 04:07:57,819
content.

3429
04:07:57,819 --> 04:08:03,000
That would have to be...

3430
04:08:03,000 --> 04:08:05,239
That would have to be a very big game.

3431
04:08:05,239 --> 04:08:12,350
VR.

3432
04:08:12,350 --> 04:08:14,649
Well, the VR was only

3433
04:08:14,649 --> 04:08:16,649
doesn't live in your house simulator.

3434
04:08:16,649 --> 04:08:21,639
Thank you, Platadonius

3435
04:08:21,639 --> 04:08:23,639
Platadenius, thanks for the 500 bits.

3436
04:08:23,639 --> 04:08:25,639
Vin Diesel had to lean down to

3437
04:08:25,639 --> 04:08:27,639
speak into the microphone because he's tall.

3438
04:08:27,639 --> 04:08:29,639
Jerma, that's just how it is for people over

3439
04:08:29,639 --> 04:08:31,639
six feet tall. That microphone was

3440
04:08:31,639 --> 04:08:33,639
probably four and a half feet off the ground.

3441
04:08:33,639 --> 04:08:39,530
Vin Diesel is 5'10".

3442
04:08:39,530 --> 04:08:43,690
Okay.

3443
04:08:43,690 --> 04:08:45,690
Thank you, Castelion

3444
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:48,190
for the 300 bits.

3445
04:08:48,190 --> 04:08:50,190
Hey, Jerma, I hope this TGA show, though awful,

3446
04:08:50,190 --> 04:08:52,190
convinces you to try Disco

3447
04:08:52,190 --> 04:08:54,190
Elcium in future. I'd love to see you

3448
04:08:54,190 --> 04:08:56,190
as a terrible degenerate detective

3449
04:08:56,190 --> 04:08:58,190
in this very little conflict.

3450
04:08:58,190 --> 04:09:00,190
Really? Well, it is not a constant

3451
04:09:00,190 --> 04:09:02,190
conflict. Why would I even want to play it?

3452
04:09:02,190 --> 04:09:09,870
I even said the name wrong.

3453
04:09:09,870 --> 04:09:14,670
Thank you, though. I'll have to

3454
04:09:14,670 --> 04:09:17,159
give it a real look.

3455
04:09:17,159 --> 04:09:19,659
Gnarly, thanks for the 250.

3456
04:09:19,659 --> 04:09:21,659
Sekiro was my game of the year, so I'm glad it won.

3457
04:09:21,659 --> 04:09:23,659
Also, I guess I'm the only League of Legends player

3458
04:09:23,659 --> 04:09:25,659
here because I'm super hyped for the new

3459
04:09:25,659 --> 04:09:27,659
League of Legends platformer and RPG

3460
04:09:27,659 --> 04:09:29,659
games, but no one else in

3461
04:09:29,659 --> 04:09:31,659
chat is. Still was an

3462
04:09:31,659 --> 04:09:40,940
underwhelming show, though.

3463
04:09:40,940 --> 04:09:42,940
I don't even have an opinion. I don't

3464
04:09:42,940 --> 04:09:44,940
play League. I don't really know the characters. I don't

3465
04:09:44,940 --> 04:09:46,940
connect with the world. I don't know anything about it, so.

3466
04:09:46,940 --> 04:09:51,739
Thank you, Nearshrew, for the five

3467
04:09:51,739 --> 04:09:55,899
community subs. And again,

3468
04:09:55,899 --> 04:09:57,899
great Canadian come in with a huge amount of money. Thank you,

3469
04:09:57,899 --> 04:10:02,760
Canadian. 25

3470
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:04,760
Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 250 bits.

3471
04:10:04,760 --> 04:10:06,760
Fuck the king. That's treason.

3472
04:10:06,760 --> 04:10:08,760
I want to be the king's friend.

3473
04:10:08,760 --> 04:10:10,760
You are the exact reason

3474
04:10:10,760 --> 04:10:12,760
why I think people are very seriously overestimating

3475
04:10:12,760 --> 04:10:14,760
how quickly I'm going to die.

3476
04:10:14,760 --> 04:10:19,559
Remember, you've only got

3477
04:10:19,559 --> 04:10:21,559
like six-ish plus hours

3478
04:10:21,559 --> 04:10:23,559
in the server total.

3479
04:10:23,559 --> 04:10:26,000
You don't want to enjoy those six hours.

3480
04:10:26,000 --> 04:10:28,000
Six plus maybe

3481
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:30,000
hours. You want to come kill you, but

3482
04:10:30,000 --> 04:10:32,000
if you're just going to die, you can't come back in.

3483
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:34,000
You want to protect that person

3484
04:10:34,000 --> 04:10:36,000
that keeps that going. You want to protect

3485
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:38,000
my kingdom and me.

3486
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:40,239
You get to stay around.

3487
04:10:40,239 --> 04:10:46,510
You rush the front door in the first

3488
04:10:46,510 --> 04:10:48,510
20, 30 minutes of the game, then

3489
04:10:48,510 --> 04:10:50,510
you're just throwing away your game time

3490
04:10:50,510 --> 04:10:52,510
and you can't come back.

3491
04:10:52,510 --> 04:10:58,010
Think about it before you choose

3492
04:10:58,010 --> 04:11:09,659
these things. What happens if

3493
04:11:09,659 --> 04:11:11,659
everyone dies except the king?

3494
04:11:11,659 --> 04:11:13,899
It's just going to pull the next people

3495
04:11:13,899 --> 04:11:15,899
that are in the queue.

3496
04:11:15,899 --> 04:11:19,549
Let's say, because let's say there's 500 people

3497
04:11:19,549 --> 04:11:21,549
that are allowed in the server, and

3498
04:11:21,549 --> 04:11:23,549
three, four, five

3499
04:11:23,549 --> 04:11:25,549
thousand people all want to sign up

3500
04:11:25,549 --> 04:11:28,110
at the same time. They'll always just

3501
04:11:28,110 --> 04:11:30,110
be somebody else that can replace.

3502
04:11:30,110 --> 04:11:36,059
And like I said previously, if it gets to a point

3503
04:11:36,059 --> 04:11:38,059
where we're out of potential players,

3504
04:11:38,059 --> 04:11:40,059
we can wipe the slate clean

3505
04:11:40,059 --> 04:11:47,610
and just do it again.

3506
04:11:47,610 --> 04:11:49,610
If there's no more people left in the queue, then we'll just

3507
04:11:49,610 --> 04:11:56,399
refresh it.

3508
04:11:56,399 --> 04:11:59,020
We may even

3509
04:11:59,020 --> 04:12:01,020
it really just depends on how many people actually try.

3510
04:12:01,020 --> 04:12:03,200
1.8. Version of Minecraft is 1.8.

3511
04:12:03,200 --> 04:12:07,229
Is there going to be a queue

3512
04:12:07,229 --> 04:12:09,530
waiting room? Yes.

3513
04:12:09,530 --> 04:12:11,530
It'll be separate from the actual server.

3514
04:12:11,530 --> 04:12:23,819
Is it going to replace normal streams?

3515
04:12:25,819 --> 04:12:28,639
I don't, I mean, I don't know

3516
04:12:28,639 --> 04:12:30,639
what you mean by the word replace.

3517
04:12:30,639 --> 04:12:35,049
It's just a stream.

3518
04:12:35,049 --> 04:12:41,319
Is there an age limit?

3519
04:12:41,319 --> 04:12:43,319
A hundred, and you die.

3520
04:12:43,319 --> 04:12:48,700
I imagine this would be something I would want to do at least

3521
04:12:48,700 --> 04:12:50,700
once a week. For the first

3522
04:12:50,700 --> 04:12:53,520
do it three or four times and see how

3523
04:12:53,520 --> 04:12:58,639
good. Even if I die.

3524
04:12:58,639 --> 04:13:01,260
Do you age when offline? No.

3525
04:13:01,260 --> 04:13:04,510
You do not.

3526
04:13:04,510 --> 04:13:06,510
And we're going to make sure,

3527
04:13:06,510 --> 04:13:08,510
just to add to what we were saying before,

3528
04:13:08,510 --> 04:13:10,510
in that initial queue lobby system,

3529
04:13:10,510 --> 04:13:12,510
I'm going to make sure that there are a

3530
04:13:12,510 --> 04:13:14,510
shitload of rules that are just

3531
04:13:14,510 --> 04:13:16,510
put there for you to read

3532
04:13:16,510 --> 04:13:18,510
and kind of

3533
04:13:18,510 --> 04:13:20,510
compress them in at your own pace.

3534
04:13:20,510 --> 04:13:26,780
What happens when I die?

3535
04:13:26,780 --> 04:13:28,780
When I die, it's over and we do it again next week.

3536
04:13:28,780 --> 04:13:33,200
Now there are some

3537
04:13:33,200 --> 04:13:35,200
rules where if I die certain ways,

3538
04:13:35,200 --> 04:13:37,200
then I would just

3539
04:13:37,200 --> 04:13:39,200
come back and reset it. Because

3540
04:13:39,200 --> 04:13:41,629
if there is a weird

3541
04:13:41,629 --> 04:13:43,629
disconnect issue, or if something happens

3542
04:13:43,629 --> 04:13:45,629
to my game, or if there's an actual

3543
04:13:45,629 --> 04:13:47,629
glitch or something and I shouldn't have died,

3544
04:13:47,629 --> 04:13:49,629
then I come back.

3545
04:13:49,629 --> 04:13:52,430
If I disconnect

3546
04:13:52,430 --> 04:13:54,430
and I die because I was disconnected for too long,

3547
04:13:54,430 --> 04:13:56,430
then no, the king isn't dead because he

3548
04:13:56,430 --> 04:14:06,350
DC'd. He's going to get

3549
04:14:06,350 --> 04:14:08,350
crystal killed. No, there's no crystals.

3550
04:14:08,350 --> 04:14:11,420
There's no crystals.

3551
04:14:11,420 --> 04:14:13,420
There's only bows and swords

3552
04:14:13,420 --> 04:14:15,420
and small melee weapons. You can't

3553
04:14:15,420 --> 04:14:17,420
create magic fucking potion

3554
04:14:17,420 --> 04:14:28,040
bombs. We're going to

3555
04:14:28,040 --> 04:14:38,540
drop an anvil on him. Summon

3556
04:14:38,540 --> 04:14:40,540
a wither on him. That doesn't

3557
04:14:40,540 --> 04:14:43,100
exist. Only

3558
04:14:43,100 --> 04:14:45,100
creepers, skeletons, and zombies

3559
04:14:45,100 --> 04:14:47,100
are the only

3560
04:14:47,100 --> 04:14:49,100
enemies that will exist in the world.

3561
04:14:49,100 --> 04:14:53,389
No endermen,

3562
04:14:53,389 --> 04:14:55,389
no magicians,

3563
04:14:55,389 --> 04:14:57,389
no teleporting monsters. Oh yeah, spiders,

3564
04:14:57,389 --> 04:14:59,950
yes, yes, yes. Just the

3565
04:14:59,950 --> 04:15:01,950
basic enemies that don't have

3566
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:03,950
a special mechanic

3567
04:15:03,950 --> 04:15:05,950
that instantly kills you in shit.

3568
04:15:05,950 --> 04:15:09,920
None of that. Because we don't give a shit

3569
04:15:09,920 --> 04:15:12,600
about that anyways. It's us

3570
04:15:12,600 --> 04:15:14,600
that we care about, not what monsters

3571
04:15:14,600 --> 04:15:22,860
are spawnable. Let's keep going though.

3572
04:15:22,860 --> 04:15:27,399
And again, questions,

3573
04:15:27,399 --> 04:15:30,219
comments. I'm going to be around

3574
04:15:30,219 --> 04:15:32,219
all day for the next few days

3575
04:15:32,219 --> 04:15:34,219
jumping back and forth. I'll be

3576
04:15:34,219 --> 04:15:36,219
in the discord. I'll make a separate channel. We can talk.

3577
04:15:36,219 --> 04:15:39,100
Go check it out.

3578
04:15:39,100 --> 04:15:42,559
I want a graffiti of your castle. We'll give you buckets.

3579
04:15:42,559 --> 04:15:49,719
Probably not immediately.

3580
04:15:49,719 --> 04:15:51,719
But thank you gooberry juice.

3581
04:15:51,719 --> 04:15:54,989
Why am I ruling a city of just babies?

3582
04:15:54,989 --> 04:15:56,989
Whose babies are we? Did you

3583
04:15:56,989 --> 04:15:58,989
kidnap us? Are you employing babies?

3584
04:15:58,989 --> 04:16:03,469
No, it's not. It's just

3585
04:16:03,469 --> 04:16:05,469
the time that you're in the server.

3586
04:16:05,469 --> 04:16:07,469
And it's in place

3587
04:16:07,469 --> 04:16:09,469
to prevent

3588
04:16:09,469 --> 04:16:11,469
immediate griefing.

3589
04:16:11,469 --> 04:16:13,840
Of the immediate nature.

3590
04:16:13,840 --> 04:16:16,010
I spawn, turn,

3591
04:16:16,010 --> 04:16:18,010
and kill the guy

3592
04:16:18,010 --> 04:16:20,010
standing next to me in five seconds

3593
04:16:20,010 --> 04:16:26,600
of spawning. That's why it's

3594
04:16:26,600 --> 04:16:31,850
there. It's battle royale.

3595
04:16:31,850 --> 04:16:33,850
I don't want this to turn into a br.

3596
04:16:33,850 --> 04:16:35,850
I don't want this to be baby br.

3597
04:16:35,850 --> 04:16:40,590
The first 10 to 20 minutes

3598
04:16:40,590 --> 04:16:42,590
of your time in the game, you're almost

3599
04:16:42,590 --> 04:16:52,440
100% useless.

3600
04:16:52,440 --> 04:16:55,389
This is just br. Kind of.

3601
04:16:55,389 --> 04:16:59,290
Thank you sly161 for the

3602
04:16:59,290 --> 04:17:01,290
250. Really looking forward to this minecraft stream.

3603
04:17:01,290 --> 04:17:03,290
Let me know if you need a royal food taste tester.

3604
04:17:03,290 --> 04:17:10,399
Yeah, we just gotta get one off the ground

3605
04:17:10,399 --> 04:17:12,399
first. And then this can progress

3606
04:17:12,399 --> 04:17:14,399
in a million ways.

3607
04:17:14,399 --> 04:17:16,399
Hey, Phil White, thanks for the thousand bits, Phil.

3608
04:17:16,399 --> 04:17:18,399
I'm really excited to see what I can

3609
04:17:18,399 --> 04:17:20,399
do to serve my king till I'm old of age.

3610
04:17:20,399 --> 04:17:22,399
But in reality, I'm probably

3611
04:17:22,399 --> 04:17:24,399
just going to be one of the bludgeoned

3612
04:17:24,399 --> 04:17:26,399
babies during the dark age.

3613
04:17:33,690 --> 04:17:35,690
Alright, let's talk about

3614
04:17:35,690 --> 04:17:38,059
something else real quick.

3615
04:17:38,059 --> 04:17:40,360
The first few hundred people

3616
04:17:40,360 --> 04:17:42,360
that come into the server,

3617
04:17:42,360 --> 04:17:44,360
you're the pioneers.

3618
04:17:44,360 --> 04:17:46,360
It is the dark times. It is the pioneering

3619
04:17:46,360 --> 04:17:48,360
stage of this game.

3620
04:17:48,360 --> 04:17:51,370
Because you

3621
04:17:51,370 --> 04:17:54,639
are the first. Whoever

3622
04:17:54,639 --> 04:17:56,639
comes after you

3623
04:17:56,639 --> 04:17:58,639
is going to have seen what happened

3624
04:17:58,639 --> 04:18:01,899
to you. And they

3625
04:18:01,899 --> 04:18:03,899
are going to have to maybe change their game plan

3626
04:18:03,899 --> 04:18:09,209
a little. Everyone in that first

3627
04:18:09,209 --> 04:18:12,989
wave, I don't know

3628
04:18:12,989 --> 04:18:17,020
what's going to happen. It is not going to be

3629
04:18:17,020 --> 04:18:19,260
a persistent server. We're going

3630
04:18:19,260 --> 04:18:21,260
to save state the server when the stream turns off

3631
04:18:21,260 --> 04:18:23,260
and turn it on the next time.

3632
04:18:23,260 --> 04:18:36,760
Are there going to be secrets?

3633
04:18:36,760 --> 04:18:40,159
Yeah, I, yes, yes.

3634
04:18:40,159 --> 04:18:42,159
I want to, eventually,

3635
04:18:42,159 --> 04:18:44,159
this is all eventually stuff.

3636
04:18:44,159 --> 04:18:47,100
I want to add little missions that people

3637
04:18:47,100 --> 04:18:50,040
can go on. Any way

3638
04:18:50,040 --> 04:18:56,250
that I can distract you.

3639
04:18:56,250 --> 04:19:00,090
This is called Fuck the King. But what

3640
04:19:00,090 --> 04:19:02,090
if things are more interesting than

3641
04:19:02,090 --> 04:19:06,889
Fuck the King? We'll see.

3642
04:19:06,889 --> 04:19:10,989
Distracting us from the

3643
04:19:10,989 --> 04:19:19,309
slaughter. Hey Sad Vega, thanks

3644
04:19:19,309 --> 04:19:21,309
again for the thousand bits. I cannot wait to watch

3645
04:19:21,309 --> 04:19:23,309
this shit show play out. Here's

3646
04:19:23,309 --> 04:19:25,309
some more bits to the cause. Hope when

3647
04:19:25,309 --> 04:19:27,309
I can get out on this. Do you plan to do other games

3648
04:19:27,309 --> 04:19:29,309
for FTK?

3649
04:19:29,309 --> 04:19:31,309
I'd love to see a

3650
04:19:31,309 --> 04:19:35,079
Conan version. The idea

3651
04:19:35,079 --> 04:19:37,079
is there. Minecraft was just

3652
04:19:37,079 --> 04:19:39,079
the easiest to have a bunch of people in.

3653
04:19:39,079 --> 04:19:42,350
You're aware this is going to be an

3654
04:19:42,350 --> 04:19:45,360
unmitigated disaster, correct?

3655
04:19:45,360 --> 04:19:48,170
Yeah, I wouldn't have this any other way.

3656
04:19:48,170 --> 04:19:54,569
That's sort of intentional,

3657
04:19:54,569 --> 04:19:56,569
I think. I think that's part of the plan.

3658
04:19:56,569 --> 04:20:02,010
If it goes completely smoothly

3659
04:20:02,010 --> 04:20:04,010
and it's

3660
04:20:04,010 --> 04:20:06,250
almost unexpected at this point.

3661
04:20:06,250 --> 04:20:11,239
All babies move north to build

3662
04:20:11,239 --> 04:20:13,239
a dirt dick city. We will create an opposing civilization.

3663
04:20:13,239 --> 04:20:15,239
Gain strength, improving our weapons

3664
04:20:15,239 --> 04:20:17,239
and armor. Then we will come commence

3665
04:20:17,239 --> 04:20:19,239
the assault on the kingdom.

3666
04:20:19,239 --> 04:20:24,040
You're going to tell what your plan is.

3667
04:20:24,040 --> 04:20:30,239
Again,

3668
04:20:30,239 --> 04:20:32,239
I don't know what you guys are doing.

3669
04:20:32,239 --> 04:20:34,239
There's going to be a bunch of cameras that we're

3670
04:20:34,239 --> 04:20:36,239
cutting to that are showing the world.

3671
04:20:36,239 --> 04:20:38,239
Zooming in on stuff, seeing any interesting

3672
04:20:38,239 --> 04:20:40,239
thing happening in the town or outside in the wilderness.

3673
04:20:40,239 --> 04:20:42,239
I don't know those things. I'm

3674
04:20:42,239 --> 04:20:44,409
playing the game with you.

3675
04:20:44,409 --> 04:20:47,420
If you guys made a new civilization

3676
04:20:47,420 --> 04:20:49,420
that I didn't know about,

3677
04:20:49,420 --> 04:20:51,420
how would I ever know it existed in the first place?

3678
04:20:51,420 --> 04:20:54,110
If I find out about it,

3679
04:20:54,110 --> 04:21:10,360
oh, you're fucked.

3680
04:21:10,360 --> 04:21:13,120
Is the town destructible?

3681
04:21:13,120 --> 04:21:15,120
I don't think so.

3682
04:21:15,120 --> 04:21:17,120
Not immediately.

3683
04:21:17,120 --> 04:21:20,120
I think certain things can be

3684
04:21:20,120 --> 04:21:22,299
destroyed.

3685
04:21:22,299 --> 04:21:24,299
We're not sure yet. We're trying to see how that would all work.

3686
04:21:24,299 --> 04:21:28,270
I don't think you can

3687
04:21:28,270 --> 04:21:30,270
build in the city.

3688
04:21:30,270 --> 04:21:32,700
We decided to do that to keep it

3689
04:21:32,700 --> 04:21:34,700
pretty clear.

3690
04:21:34,700 --> 04:21:36,700
The out of bounds area

3691
04:21:36,700 --> 04:21:39,389
is more designed for you to kind of make

3692
04:21:39,389 --> 04:21:41,389
your own little houses and have your own little communities

3693
04:21:41,389 --> 04:21:44,840
and stuff.

3694
04:21:44,840 --> 04:21:46,840
The actual town with the castles

3695
04:21:46,840 --> 04:21:48,840
and the little shops and the walkways,

3696
04:21:48,840 --> 04:21:50,840
that's more for

3697
04:21:50,840 --> 04:21:53,340
participating in the game.

3698
04:21:53,340 --> 04:22:01,659
What does the king do? Whatever I want.

3699
04:22:01,659 --> 04:22:05,879
Survive. Exist.

3700
04:22:05,879 --> 04:22:07,879
Participate.

3701
04:22:07,879 --> 04:22:09,879
Play. Engage.

3702
04:22:09,879 --> 04:22:15,559
All things.

3703
04:22:15,559 --> 04:22:17,559
We're talking about the capital.

3704
04:22:17,559 --> 04:22:23,260
To give you an idea,

3705
04:22:23,260 --> 04:22:25,260
the actual capital, the town,

3706
04:22:25,260 --> 04:22:27,260
is I believe

3707
04:22:27,260 --> 04:22:30,909
2000 by 2000.

3708
04:22:30,909 --> 04:22:32,909
And then outside of that is a much larger

3709
04:22:32,909 --> 04:22:51,770
area. It's pretty big.

3710
04:22:51,770 --> 04:22:53,770
I just want to make a house and live with the Germanites.

3711
04:22:53,770 --> 04:23:00,559
I don't think that many

3712
04:23:00,559 --> 04:23:02,559
players can play on that, on your idea.

3713
04:23:02,559 --> 04:23:04,559
It is.

3714
04:23:04,559 --> 04:23:10,700
Like I said, the people that are running

3715
04:23:10,700 --> 04:23:12,700
this have a ton of experience

3716
04:23:12,700 --> 04:23:14,700
with very large scale servers.

3717
04:23:14,700 --> 04:23:25,129
And there are plans for us

3718
04:23:25,129 --> 04:23:27,129
to beat the ever living

3719
04:23:27,129 --> 04:23:29,129
shit out of these servers

3720
04:23:29,129 --> 04:23:31,129
before we even try to have any players

3721
04:23:31,129 --> 04:23:33,129
come on them. So there are things we're going to

3722
04:23:33,129 --> 04:23:36,329
be doing. And somebody just kind

3723
04:23:36,329 --> 04:23:38,329
of wrote it, this is the stress

3724
04:23:38,329 --> 04:23:40,760
test. Right.

3725
04:23:40,760 --> 04:23:55,040
That's also true. Am I gonna play

3726
04:23:55,040 --> 04:23:57,040
a game? No, not tonight. This is

3727
04:23:57,040 --> 04:24:00,239
the end of the stream here. I'm

3728
04:24:00,239 --> 04:24:02,239
literally, I'm literally

3729
04:24:02,239 --> 04:24:04,239
I'm gonna get off stream and just go

3730
04:24:04,239 --> 04:24:06,239
right back to what I was doing before the stream started.

3731
04:24:06,239 --> 04:24:11,420
Shitty viewbot, thanks for the 300 bits.

3732
04:24:11,420 --> 04:24:13,420
I'm buying and installing Minecraft for the first time

3733
04:24:13,420 --> 04:24:15,420
just for this occasion. You better not

3734
04:24:15,420 --> 04:24:17,719
fuck this up.

3735
04:24:17,719 --> 04:24:22,649
Jesus. Smelly boy, thanks for the

3736
04:24:22,649 --> 04:24:24,649
250. If I make a nice

3737
04:24:24,649 --> 04:24:26,649
Minecraft farm, will the king come out and

3738
04:24:26,649 --> 04:24:28,649
look at it and tell me how good of a farmer I am?

3739
04:24:28,649 --> 04:24:32,170
Probably.

3740
04:24:32,170 --> 04:24:34,170
Better not have any landmines under the corn.

3741
04:24:34,170 --> 04:24:36,170
I'll be checking.

3742
04:24:36,170 --> 04:24:45,129
He's gonna destroy it.

3743
04:24:45,129 --> 04:24:49,360
Oh man.

3744
04:24:49,360 --> 04:24:51,360
Hey, permanent marks, thanks for the 250. Can I

3745
04:24:51,360 --> 04:24:53,360
exchange these bits for bald coin currency in

3746
04:24:53,360 --> 04:24:56,680
Minecraft? No, I'm sorry.

3747
04:24:56,680 --> 04:24:59,049
Gromicus, thanks for the 300

3748
04:24:59,049 --> 04:25:01,049
bits. Hey, Jerma, my little nephew Tucker is your

3749
04:25:01,049 --> 04:25:03,049
biggest fan. Can you please shout him out as

3750
04:25:03,049 --> 04:25:19,420
Tucker?

3751
04:25:19,420 --> 04:25:23,959
It's, there's a

3752
04:25:23,959 --> 04:25:25,959
I think this is a different language. I don't know what

3753
04:25:25,959 --> 04:25:30,120
is it. I don't know. Is this

3754
04:25:30,120 --> 04:25:35,440
He's searching right

3755
04:25:35,440 --> 04:25:40,940
now what this is. It says

3756
04:25:40,940 --> 04:25:42,940
please shout him out as

3757
04:25:42,940 --> 04:25:44,940
this the this.

3758
04:25:44,940 --> 04:25:51,280
Why can't I, I can't. Okay, let me see who this is.

3759
04:25:51,280 --> 04:26:05,159
This the this.

3760
04:26:05,159 --> 04:26:07,159
He can't. Alright, it's T

3761
04:26:07,159 --> 04:26:09,159
T-U-C-E

3762
04:26:09,159 --> 04:26:11,159
space

3763
04:26:11,159 --> 04:26:21,520
What's that? And then

3764
04:26:21,520 --> 04:26:24,270
D-D-E

3765
04:26:24,270 --> 04:26:30,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is that? What is that?

3766
04:26:30,090 --> 04:26:39,239
Why you guys, why you guys writing that?

3767
04:26:39,239 --> 04:26:47,180
Why you guys writing that? Okay, yep.

3768
04:26:47,180 --> 04:26:51,600
Thank you Gromicus for the 300 bits.

3769
04:26:51,600 --> 04:26:54,920
You see those questions, people write in the

3770
04:26:54,920 --> 04:26:56,920
question marks, what's he talking about? What's he doing?

3771
04:26:56,920 --> 04:27:01,719
You understand.

3772
04:27:01,719 --> 04:27:07,229
Thank you Panda Poploin for the

3773
04:27:07,229 --> 04:27:09,229
500 bits. I made a YouTube playlist of

3774
04:27:09,229 --> 04:27:11,229
all Jerma videos and streams and called it JermaTV.

3775
04:27:11,229 --> 04:27:13,229
It's got

3776
04:27:13,229 --> 04:27:15,229
805 videos

3777
04:27:15,229 --> 04:27:17,229
and a total run time length of

3778
04:27:17,229 --> 04:27:19,229
2916 hours

3779
04:27:19,229 --> 04:27:24,350
or 121

3780
04:27:24,350 --> 04:27:26,350
days. If you were to

3781
04:27:26,350 --> 04:27:28,350
start that playlist as it is now and

3782
04:27:28,350 --> 04:27:30,350
leave it running, it would finish on April

3783
04:27:30,350 --> 04:27:32,350
11th, 2020.

3784
04:27:32,350 --> 04:27:36,829
Holy shit.

3785
04:27:36,829 --> 04:27:38,829
That's an interesting bunch of facts here.

3786
04:27:38,829 --> 04:27:44,969
3000 hours

3787
04:27:44,969 --> 04:27:46,969
pretty much. Well, here it is if anyone's curious.

3788
04:27:46,969 --> 04:27:49,659
Just start that and then

3789
04:27:49,659 --> 04:27:51,659
finish it on the cyberpunk release day.

3790
04:27:51,659 --> 04:27:57,739
Yeah, that's right.

3791
04:27:57,739 --> 04:28:03,229
Just in time.

3792
04:28:03,229 --> 04:28:05,229
Thank you that Panda. That's actually

3793
04:28:05,229 --> 04:28:07,229
really cool. I've never seen

3794
04:28:07,229 --> 04:28:09,229
that data presented to me before.

3795
04:28:09,229 --> 04:28:12,110
Interesting to think about that.

3796
04:28:12,110 --> 04:28:14,110
121 and a half days

3797
04:28:14,110 --> 04:28:16,110
of video footage.

3798
04:28:16,110 --> 04:28:23,450
Very cool.

3799
04:28:23,450 --> 04:28:25,450
Socktrot, thanks for 500 bits. Please help.

3800
04:28:25,450 --> 04:28:27,450
I don't know what Pog or Jebaited is and no

3801
04:28:27,450 --> 04:28:29,450
one will tell me. I can help you.

3802
04:28:29,450 --> 04:28:31,450
Pog is

3803
04:28:31,450 --> 04:28:33,450
holy shit and Jebaited is

3804
04:28:33,450 --> 04:28:37,549
we got him laughing.

3805
04:28:37,549 --> 04:28:42,350
That's all you need to know. Apple Shift

3806
04:28:42,350 --> 04:28:44,969
thanks for the 250. Hey man,

3807
04:28:44,969 --> 04:28:46,969
today I quit my shitty job, which is kind of bittersweet

3808
04:28:46,969 --> 04:28:48,969
since I'll miss my coworkers.

3809
04:28:48,969 --> 04:28:50,969
But hey, here's 250 to

3810
04:28:50,969 --> 04:28:52,969
new beginnings. If I also be able to catch

3811
04:28:52,969 --> 04:28:54,969
more streams now, which is great.

3812
04:28:54,969 --> 04:28:56,969
PS, I've got to go to a thing on Sunday

3813
04:28:56,969 --> 04:28:58,969
so I won't be able to make the Minecraft stream.

3814
04:28:58,969 --> 04:29:00,969
But I'll be there for the next one for sure.

3815
04:29:00,969 --> 04:29:02,969
Godspeed, good sir. Best of

3816
04:29:02,969 --> 04:29:04,969
luck to you. Best of luck to you.

3817
04:29:04,969 --> 04:29:07,719
Seems like a pretty major change.

3818
04:29:07,719 --> 04:29:11,360
Best of luck to you.

3819
04:29:11,360 --> 04:29:19,229
Godspeed to you as well.

3820
04:29:19,229 --> 04:29:22,489
Thanks for the 250. Let's hope you

3821
04:29:22,489 --> 04:29:24,489
start something else soon here.

3822
04:29:24,489 --> 04:29:26,920
Something that you're more

3823
04:29:26,920 --> 04:29:30,760
happy with. Thanks again for the 250.

3824
04:29:30,760 --> 04:29:34,600
CadBTV

3825
04:29:34,600 --> 04:29:36,600
thanks for the 500 bits. I cannot wait to cut down

3826
04:29:36,600 --> 04:29:38,600
murderous babies in defense of my king.

3827
04:29:38,600 --> 04:29:42,059
Yes, you have to protect me at

3828
04:29:42,059 --> 04:29:47,180
all costs. Murderous

3829
04:29:47,180 --> 04:29:57,549
babies. This streamer

3830
04:29:57,549 --> 04:30:01,200
is fucked. Hey, the Dinkster.

3831
04:30:01,200 --> 04:30:03,200
Thanks for the 500 bits. I like this

3832
04:30:03,200 --> 04:30:05,819
man. I'm happy you do.

3833
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:09,530
Thank you. That's

3834
04:30:09,530 --> 04:30:14,719
the end, guys. No, it's not.

3835
04:30:14,719 --> 04:30:16,719
I forgot about the credits. What am I thinking?

3836
04:30:16,719 --> 04:30:26,120
I'm too caught up with all the other stuff going on.

3837
04:30:26,120 --> 04:30:29,639
Ow, ow, ow.

3838
04:30:29,639 --> 04:30:37,129
Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.

3839
04:30:37,129 --> 04:30:39,129
I'm looking over at how

3840
04:30:39,129 --> 04:30:41,129
many people subbed today. That's a lot.

3841
04:30:41,129 --> 04:30:45,870
It's because of the server.

3842
04:30:45,870 --> 04:30:47,870
Yeah, but you, there's no, you need

3843
04:30:47,870 --> 04:30:50,299
to be subbed for, for the first

3844
04:30:50,299 --> 04:30:52,299
one, you have to be subbed for two months.

3845
04:30:52,299 --> 04:30:56,649
That might pull back

3846
04:30:56,649 --> 04:31:02,409
when we do another one. Are there going to be baby

3847
04:31:02,409 --> 04:31:04,409
player models or are we just going to be the same size?

3848
04:31:04,409 --> 04:31:06,409
I believe it's going to be a different

3849
04:31:06,409 --> 04:31:08,969
model for the first

3850
04:31:08,969 --> 04:31:10,969
30, 40 minutes of your life.

3851
04:31:10,969 --> 04:31:18,010
That was still tentative when we talked earlier,

3852
04:31:18,010 --> 04:31:22,680
so I'm not sure. People didn't realize

3853
04:31:22,680 --> 04:31:24,680
the event was in three days.

3854
04:31:24,680 --> 04:31:40,040
Two months in a row or total? Two months in a

3855
04:31:40,040 --> 04:31:44,200
row. Yeah, I had that on,

3856
04:31:44,200 --> 04:31:46,200
I had that on screen. I had that on screen

3857
04:31:46,200 --> 04:31:48,200
for like 40 minutes.

3858
04:31:48,200 --> 04:31:50,200
They said two plus months

3859
04:31:50,200 --> 04:31:54,489
in a row.

3860
04:31:54,489 --> 04:32:10,670
Barely made it.

3861
04:32:10,670 --> 04:32:12,670
Did it have to be an active sub?

3862
04:32:12,670 --> 04:32:15,420
Yeah, remember, the whole purpose

3863
04:32:15,420 --> 04:32:17,420
of doing it, we've talked about it

3864
04:32:17,420 --> 04:32:19,420
three or four times already here.

3865
04:32:19,420 --> 04:32:21,420
The point of having it be two plus

3866
04:32:21,420 --> 04:32:23,420
subs is because if somebody

3867
04:32:23,420 --> 04:32:25,420
catches the stream

3868
04:32:25,420 --> 04:32:27,420
and they say, oh

3869
04:32:27,420 --> 04:32:29,420
wait, you're telling me I can just,

3870
04:32:29,420 --> 04:32:31,420
I could pay five dollars

3871
04:32:31,420 --> 04:32:33,420
and try to ruin a server?

3872
04:32:33,420 --> 04:32:36,360
That's the point.

3873
04:32:36,360 --> 04:32:38,360
To make it so nobody

3874
04:32:38,360 --> 04:32:40,360
can, at least on the first

3875
04:32:40,360 --> 04:32:42,729
one, it's a preventative measure.

3876
04:32:42,729 --> 04:32:50,799
You know what I'm saying? They need to pay

3877
04:32:50,799 --> 04:32:52,799
ten dollars for two

3878
04:32:52,799 --> 04:32:55,799
straight months. So

3879
04:32:55,799 --> 04:32:57,799
good, alright. In two months

3880
04:32:57,799 --> 04:33:00,559
from now, if you

3881
04:33:00,559 --> 04:33:02,559
wanted to pay five bucks and try

3882
04:33:02,559 --> 04:33:10,040
to ruin the server,

3883
04:33:10,040 --> 04:33:12,040
we're also still working on that too.

3884
04:33:12,040 --> 04:33:19,130
It just had to be in place.

3885
04:33:19,130 --> 04:33:21,130
It's just too, it's too exploitable.

3886
04:33:21,130 --> 04:33:23,130
It just is, I really didn't want to do it

3887
04:33:23,130 --> 04:33:37,150
but it had to be done.

3888
04:33:37,150 --> 04:33:39,150
I honestly would have done six months.

3889
04:33:39,150 --> 04:33:42,479
I think that's too much.

3890
04:33:42,479 --> 04:33:50,540
Guys, remember,

3891
04:33:50,540 --> 04:33:52,540
the subs have to exist

3892
04:33:52,540 --> 04:33:54,540
and I'm not even sure there's that many

3893
04:33:54,540 --> 04:33:56,540
six month straight subs.

3894
04:33:56,540 --> 04:34:07,099
At that point it would be six months total.

3895
04:34:07,099 --> 04:34:10,619
But I'm not sure,

3896
04:34:10,619 --> 04:34:12,619
it might be hard to pull that

3897
04:34:12,619 --> 04:34:15,369
data. But as it stands right now

3898
04:34:15,369 --> 04:34:17,369
it's just, you have to have been subbed for two

3899
04:34:17,369 --> 04:34:19,369
months. Like the last

3900
04:34:19,369 --> 04:34:29,159
sixty days essentially. I'm a

3901
04:34:29,159 --> 04:34:31,159
seventeen month sub repeat sub but it doesn't

3902
04:34:31,159 --> 04:34:33,159
count because it's prime?

3903
04:34:33,159 --> 04:34:42,619
That's not true. Yeah,

3904
04:34:42,619 --> 04:34:44,619
of course, yeah, prime subs count. Of course they do.

3905
04:34:44,619 --> 04:34:52,680
Yeah, yeah, no,

3906
04:34:52,680 --> 04:34:54,680
prime counts.

3907
04:34:54,680 --> 04:34:57,819
You just had to have been subscribed.

3908
04:34:57,819 --> 04:34:59,819
It doesn't, it's not.

3909
04:34:59,819 --> 04:35:07,419
Yeah, that's fine. Uh oh, the babies

3910
04:35:07,419 --> 04:35:12,279
have doubled. So if it says my

3911
04:35:12,279 --> 04:35:14,279
current streak is nine months even though I missed

3912
04:35:14,279 --> 04:35:16,279
my last sub by a few days, I'm fine.

3913
04:35:16,279 --> 04:35:19,040
Yeah, it should be fine. It's just

3914
04:35:19,040 --> 04:35:21,040
pulling what Twitch is reporting

3915
04:35:21,040 --> 04:35:33,130
out, right? The streak window

3916
04:35:33,130 --> 04:35:35,130
is like forty days.

3917
04:35:35,130 --> 04:35:37,130
Yeah, so that's fine.

3918
04:35:37,130 --> 04:35:44,810
People are gonna be really salty

3919
04:35:44,810 --> 04:35:47,630
in chat when they die.

3920
04:35:47,630 --> 04:35:49,630
Yeah, but that's kind of inevitable though.

3921
04:35:49,630 --> 04:35:51,630
Alright, look.

3922
04:35:51,630 --> 04:35:56,090
You're, look,

3923
04:35:56,090 --> 04:35:58,090
listen, you're gonna die.

3924
04:35:58,090 --> 04:36:00,090
Okay? It's just

3925
04:36:00,090 --> 04:36:02,270
gonna happen. You're

3926
04:36:02,270 --> 04:36:04,270
gonna die. If you join

3927
04:36:04,270 --> 04:36:06,270
the server, you're

3928
04:36:06,270 --> 04:36:08,270
dead. If you're

3929
04:36:08,270 --> 04:36:10,270
maybe not, but you have to

3930
04:36:10,270 --> 04:36:12,270
go in with

3931
04:36:12,270 --> 04:36:14,270
wow, really? No, I'm just saying

3932
04:36:14,270 --> 04:36:16,639
this is chaos.

3933
04:36:16,639 --> 04:36:18,639
This is, you

3934
04:36:18,639 --> 04:36:20,639
can't go into the server and be like,

3935
04:36:20,639 --> 04:36:22,639
I can't wait to live a long, fruitful life

3936
04:36:22,639 --> 04:36:24,639
in here. It's gonna be anarchy.

3937
04:36:24,639 --> 04:36:26,939
It's gonna be controlled anarchy.

3938
04:36:26,939 --> 04:36:28,939
But it's,

3939
04:36:28,939 --> 04:36:30,939
I can't guarantee you that you'll last

3940
04:36:30,939 --> 04:36:32,939
ten seconds or you'll last five

3941
04:36:32,939 --> 04:36:35,819
hours. I don't know. I don't

3942
04:36:35,819 --> 04:36:41,840
know. You need to have a grave

3943
04:36:41,840 --> 04:36:43,840
keeper for all the deaths.

3944
04:36:43,840 --> 04:36:49,279
So I hope you

3945
04:36:49,279 --> 04:36:51,279
don't get upset if

3946
04:36:51,279 --> 04:36:53,279
you spawn in and within twenty

3947
04:36:53,279 --> 04:36:55,279
minutes you haven't been fed

3948
04:36:55,279 --> 04:36:57,279
and somebody kills you.

3949
04:36:57,279 --> 04:36:59,279
I'm sorry.

3950
04:36:59,279 --> 04:37:08,110
I'm gonna do my best to run the kingdom

3951
04:37:08,110 --> 04:37:12,720
as well as I can.

3952
04:37:12,720 --> 04:37:14,720
And that's, if you're watching

3953
04:37:14,720 --> 04:37:16,720
the stream, I know, oh,

3954
04:37:16,720 --> 04:37:18,720
I wish I could participate, but it might

3955
04:37:18,720 --> 04:37:20,720
even be more fun if you just watch.

3956
04:37:20,720 --> 04:37:23,340
This is gonna be an absolute joke

3957
04:37:23,340 --> 04:37:25,520
of the stream. Potentially more than

3958
04:37:25,520 --> 04:37:34,540
three or four times. See you Sunday,

3959
04:37:34,540 --> 04:37:38,189
though. Join the Discord. There'll be a channel

3960
04:37:38,189 --> 04:37:42,409
there soon about this stream.

3961
04:37:42,409 --> 04:37:46,880
Have fun, because that's all I care about.

3962
04:37:46,880 --> 04:38:09,319
See you soon.
