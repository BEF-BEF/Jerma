1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,989
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Wait a second. Yeah

2
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:29,899
Kick player tanklop. No reason given. Get him out of here. Oh get him out of here booted. Hey, welcome to Facecam Fortress 2

3
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:36,780
My name is Jerma. Welcome to the party. Good to see you. Glad you came. There is a spy standing just right here.

4
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,939
Vote failed. I'm currently

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,289
NACL is my name on here. What the hell is going on?

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,170
This is just cottage. Playing as the combat engineer, like I said with the frontier justice, the gunslinger and the pistol.

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,170
Yeah, that's the pistol.

8
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,359
See if we can't keep them in their spawn. That would be fantastic. You know what? Let's just put another one down.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,980
Get out of the way. Who's gonna? Well, what am I bumping into? Oh my god.

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Get out of here, man.

11
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:16,780
Spy on top of my spy. Slapping my spy. Anybody? Come on. Come on now.

12
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,060
Who wants to come out? Scout wants to come out. You're gonna get riddled with bullets, dude. I told you not to do that.

13
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:31,329
So how about this? Every time I die, I'm gonna chug some Dr. Pepper. We're gonna chug, chug, chug, chug.

14
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,569
There's nobody. Is anybody even gonna get out of here?

15
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:46,500
That sniper just went right through my, almost through my face. Yeah, we have them just trapped in here.

16
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,019
Get me out of here, please.

17
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,079
That guy can't even, like, build me. Like, are you real? Yes, you're real.

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,310
Uh, where's my dispenser? Where is my dispenser right now? I don't even know where I put it. Oh, it's up there.

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,800
All right, if by two minutes they do not get out of the spawn,

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,439
I'm gonna switch teams.

21
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,439
See if we can't make something crazy happen.

22
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:28,300
Two minutes. You got until two minutes. Come on now. Somebody come out. Oh, we only got 13 seconds.

23
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,469
10, 9, 8, 7,

24
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,389
6,

25
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,430
5,

26
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,550
4,

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,469
3. Kick this dude again for no reason and

28
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,659
time to switch.

29
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:54,319
Can't even switch. I tried. Oh, I died. Yeah. Can I please switch teams?

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,539
All right, so we got a team scramble. That's what I like to see. Hopefully the teams are a little more fair now.

31
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,919
I'm not gonna be able to get this sentry out right away.

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,759
So let's just go. Hopefully I can put it like one or two back.

33
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,439
I remember every time I die, I got to chug Dr. Pepper. That's what happens. That's the that's the punishment.

34
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,650
But is it really punishment? I find that to be quite a reward to be honest with you.

35
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:30,800
Let's see if I can't get this in here. Yeah, and this is also right here. Hey, hey, hey, get out of here.

36
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,060
Get off my lawn, you rotten kids.

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,319
Hello. I need the teleporter to be here, facing this way.

38
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
This is one of my favorite places to put a sentry.

39
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,349
Or I like to go up, like there, like up here. But I was a little late as you saw, so

40
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,860
let's do it. How's that teleporter built? Let's hope so. You,

41
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:12,819
are you real? I don't think you're real. You're being real. You're acting really odd here. Oh, but that's great.

42
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:25,600
You, come here you. Hey, follow me this way Pyro. I dare you. A double dog dare you. All I see is a sniper's butt.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,279
Get your butt out of my face. Level three. Good, good, good.

44
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,509
Fantastic. I need to get this. You know what? We're gonna go like this. It's gonna go back here.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,279
I know it's probably gonna get taken up by a spy, but you know what?

46
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:56,670
Sometimes you just, what is going on here? Oh, we're good. Get that Pyro. Get him. Get that Pyro, you hear?

47
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:09,649
Scout's going around. What on earth is this guy doing? No, kill him. Nice. Build, build, build, build, build.

48
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,839
Get that to level three.

49
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,220
Level three's the way I wanna be. Make sure you don't get backstabbed by a

50
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,569
spy like this one right here.

51
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:42,529
You. I'm so paranoid. Whenever I play engineer on upward, I get so paranoid because they really could be literally anywhere because it's so hard to play engineer.

52
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,449
It's so scary. Take that so no spy can get it. Level three and we gotta, I'll help you with that.

53
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:58,740
Let me help you with that my friend. Let me help you with that. Here we go.

54
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,069
And they, I might move this entry in a second here. Whoa.

55
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,449
Come on, build it, build it, build it, build it. Come on, build this damn thing.

56
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,529
Yeah. Yes. Oh, get it.

57
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,699
Get destroyed.

58
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,259
Oh, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about right there. Let's pull up some kills here, baby.

59
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:30,050
Nobody can destroy the century of doom.

60
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,170
Save my century. Save my century. It's dead.

61
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,379
Oh, no.

62
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,660
Mortis dur soul stealer. No, they're gonna get it. They're gonna get it.

63
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:57,629
Somebody just, somebody just, spy. Thank you spy. That spy was fantastic. No, don't let him get it.

64
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,629
Don't let him get, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

65
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,949
How did this guy get back here?

66
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,310
Wait, oh my god. This, I thought that was three snipers. Don't, don't let it happen.

67
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,620
I, I don't care if I have to club somebody in the face. Come on. Come on.

68
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,509
They're gonna get it. They're gonna get it. They're gonna get it.

69
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,110
No, they aren't. No, they aren't. Use your body. Use everything.

70
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,560
No, oh, damn it. God damn it, man.

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,930
All right, I'm changing up. No, I'm not. Staying engineer. My century's still alive. Where the hell is my century?

72
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,670
Where is, oh, my century's right there.

73
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,920
Come on, little century. Take him out, little century.

74
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,379
Hey, at least if it goes down now, that's okay. I'm okay with that.

75
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,899
I'm, I am okay with that because I got nine revenge crits. I'm okay with that.

76
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:03,170
Just gotta get something going here. Me and my suit jacket.

77
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,550
Oh, no, no, nothing much. Me and my suit jacket are just having a good time.

78
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,829
Three minutes. We can hold them. Three minutes. Hey, hey.

79
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,910
You, that's it. You know what? I'm sick and tired of this. I'm just gonna go down here.

80
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,810
Who else wants to get crit? Who else wants to get?

81
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,549
Soldier. No. Pyro. They're gonna like steam roll now. This is not cool, man.

82
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,100
What do I got for pyro? Good enough. Good enough.

83
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:57,039
Just hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Don't let them get over here. I just saw

84
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:08,509
a bastard right there. What are you doing? Oh, get clubbed. And I walk right into that.

85
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:18,850
Are you absolutely? That made up for the second time. Oh, I supposed to drink twice

86
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:26,559
because I died before that as the engineer. I don't even know if I did this or not. I forget.

87
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:34,129
This can is empty. That was a bad idea. Chug. Chug. Chug. Ready? Ready?

88
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:45,259
Come on, everybody. Crit fire. That's the name of the game. Get over here, man. Where's this sniper?

89
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:57,710
Heal me, please. Somebody heal me. Medic, please heal me. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Who wants

90
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:05,940
it? Who wants this? Oh, you want this medic? You. You want this? This is what you want? This is what

91
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:15,580
you want? Oh, whatever. Just get him. Just shoot him. Oh, I'm like burping every eight seconds.

92
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,809
Get rid of that. Get rid of that. What the hell is going on? Did you see how long that just took?

93
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:32,779
What was that all about? I got nothing to drink. Dude, I was holding. What is my ping? Why can I

94
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:40,029
don't? Why is tab not working? All right, whatever. I was holding the button down on that mini sentry

95
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:48,029
for like way too long. It's all right. We got this. This is going to be a GG if I do say so myself.

96
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:59,889
Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Get off of this. Get out of here. Oh, it was

97
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:08,909
worth it. It was worth it. No, they're going to cap it. Oh my god. Get him off that. Get him off it.

98
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:23,649
Get him off it. Come on, man. Come on, man. Three, two, one second. Yeah. Nice job, guys. Nice job.

99
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,940
You did a fine job tossing your little balls around. So that's going to wrap it up here,

100
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,509
guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time.

101
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,970
And of course, the strongest man in the world. Take care, everybody.
