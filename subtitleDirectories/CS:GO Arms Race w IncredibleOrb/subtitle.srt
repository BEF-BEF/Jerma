1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,769
This is not fair. Here's what I'm playing with. Floppy disk, ash cheeks, Illidan from Warcraft.

2
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:24,019
He's apparently really good at this. Oh, is that you across the way? No. Oh, come on. Bot Chris.

3
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:33,039
You hit- God, you hit me. Oh, that's you. Come play, baby. Dude, that's bot Steve. Come play.

4
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,350
There we go. There we go. No! Is that you? Okay, listen, don't get fancy. You got a kill.

5
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:47,490
Okay, I'm actually quite happy. Damn it. Damn it. I was almost at a three piece. I know you do. I know you do.

6
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,780
Okay, I'm coming over.

7
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,780
God, how did he come over?

8
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,579
What's up, dudes?

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,579
Hey, get out of here. Does this guy already have a pistol? No, he didn't.

10
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:06,200
Already has a pistol. You're starting with pistols, right? Bot Bill. Good thing it's Bot Bill.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,950
Oh my God, I just missed a bot. Oh, it's up there. Wow. Turn off your game genie. Turn it off.

12
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,950
Game genie? Yeah, you got like game genie up there.

13
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,950
Oh, what are you doing? How many times have I touched you in the face like fucking five times?

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,379
Oh my God. Can't believe you died right there. But it's okay, dude. You gotta keep trying, you know.

15
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:36,200
You just gotta hang in there. Are you behind? That wasn't me, was it? No. I'm only in third place.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,659
I'm getting destroyed by these guys. There we go. Let's clean it up here. Let's clean it up here.

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,840
Bot Tom with a life... Jesus. Bot Tom going hard.

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm afraid to go over there, man. I feel like he's gonna shoot me in the face.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Or that'll happen. I'll just drop down like Spider-Man and get myself killed.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,319
Oh God, where am I? Where am I going? No! What are you doing in the spawn? What are you doing in the spawn, Jeremy?

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
I'm spawning. What else do you do in spawn? Yeah, I thought you were spawn camping, dude.

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,319
What are you doing in spawn is the real question. I was chasing... I was looking for you guys.

23
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:28,419
Wow. You were nowhere. That was just BS right there. I don't believe it. I called BS with that one.

24
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:38,939
Oh, I'm doing great. Oh God. Floppy disk.

25
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,879
Thanks for standing still, Bot Bill. Give me the free headshot.

26
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,310
You're getting free kills off of the bots? Come on, dude. You don't want to be that guy. Oh! No, no, no, no.

27
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,550
Total commit... Floppy disk, I swear. Thanks, Bot Bill.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,550
How many free kills are you getting off Bot Bill right now? I got at least two free kills off Bot Bill.

29
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:09,979
So not fair. Are you kidding me? Get out of here. Wait, is this our spawn? Yeah, I think this is... Wow, I'm in the wrong spawn.

30
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:16,979
Did they switch? They might switch. No, I don't think... This is not called duty, dude. No, they don't switch, no.

31
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:24,930
Who's that? Okay, Wretch with a big booty. That's the picture. Yeah. That's a nice booty you got there, Wretch.

32
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:34,689
Oh, come on. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. What? I just got hit in the face. God, with that aim.

33
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:45,300
Is it a bot or no? No, that was you. Oh. Oh. Feel it. That was you with the... Hold on, let me trash talk for a bit.

34
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:53,539
Oh, get on my level. Oh. Are you mad? Are you mad? Hey, Bot Bill, stand still again so I can get some kills.

35
00:03:53,539 --> 00:04:00,360
Oh, somebody just saved me. It may have been Bot Bill. Bot Bill, is that you? God, I'm getting...

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm on the pistols right now and I'm getting screwed on. Oh. Is that you? Yeah. Good aim, dude.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah, I was aiming. I hate these guns, these LMGs. Bot Bill, Bot Bill's mine. Oh, wait, it's on my team, never mind.

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:36,709
Whoa. That big booty of Wretch's is getting all kinds of kills on me. Make it stop. Where do you come from?

39
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:45,850
I came from behind. I don't know, I think I jumped down or I either spawned down there. Behind. Yeah, you're looking good from behind, Jerma.

40
00:04:45,850 --> 00:05:00,819
Looking real good. You look beautiful. Beautiful. I can't believe it. I can't believe I didn't get that guy in the face.

41
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:14,860
No, I wish that was you. I wish that was you so bad. But no. No, but too many people. Too many people.

42
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,829
I'm stuck on a little like dipshit pistol. You're probably caught up with me, dude. Look at all these...

43
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:31,970
You got your whole team is over here. Don't shoot me, Jerma. No, fall damage. Are you kidding me? Well, that's embarrassing.

44
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:42,709
I've got to reset a level. Oh, mediocre, you... Suck on it. Suck on the justice.

45
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:50,399
I would have had so much joy from that. That is what we call the justice, Pinai. Get on it.

46
00:05:50,399 --> 00:06:05,350
All right, all right, time to take over. This guy Rio, AD and like a pro. It's gonna be fun. Man, oh man.

47
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:16,300
I just have to wait and then strike. Get out of here. Oh, no. Wow. That was you, huh? Trying to go for the knife kill on me.

48
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:27,819
That wasn't me. No. Second and third, though, man. Ain't too bad for the first game. Let's go to the monastery.

49
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:36,199
I don't care. Here we go. Let's do it. Time to be fancy. Going up right. It's going up two o'clock. Two o'clock.

50
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:46,459
The starting route in the game. Yeah. Watch my videos for tips and tricks.

51
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:54,949
How? What the hell was that? It's almost like I was shooting a time crisis machine that wasn't calibrated.

52
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:03,610
My shots were going like five feet to the right. Somebody at the arcade didn't calibrate the goddamn light gun.

53
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:15,860
That's what it looks like. Oh, I'm getting some kills. Not gonna lie. Doing solid. Camping their spawns like a boss.

54
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:23,110
Get that guy. Yeah. Camping their spawns like a boss. Like a B.O.

55
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,759
I'm scared. Oh, I just came from their spawn. I just shot you.

56
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,959
Because I was scared. I don't know. I thought you were like an enemy. You're like trigger happy.

57
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:42,589
There we go. I'm doing some damage. Not gonna lie. Bot Chris. Playing like a badass. No.

58
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:48,899
That's like my first death in like ever. Yeah. In ever. Well, not forever, but in this game.

59
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:55,269
How did you kill that guy? And I didn't. Hey, dude. Don't be mad. Get even.

60
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:02,410
I, what? This is possible. I love playing CSGO with you, dude. Thanks.

61
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:14,110
Not gonna lie. That actually startled me. I actually got startled by what just happened. Oh, God. This guy.

62
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,490
What is he doing? I just stole another kill.

63
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,730
Dude, I'm still a level three. I should be at least at like level six.

64
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:36,539
Oh, finally. I get like a shot on somebody. Come on, Chris. There we go. Come on, Chris.

65
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,919
Come on, Chris. Where they at? Oh, behind. Behind. Behind.

66
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,850
Chasing down my bot. Ooh. Hello. I'll take you down. Where is everybody? I wanna play the game.

67
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,149
I'm killing them, dude. Yeah, I got him. I'm on an 18 streak. I'm doing pretty solid.

68
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:02,399
Ooh. Lucky me. That guy was just getting lit up.

69
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,049
I love when there's like four dudes shooting at the same guy. I know. Like, yeah, I think I'm gonna die.

70
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:14,779
Oh. Oh, no. Apparently, he has phantom bullets that were going through you and hitting me in the face.

71
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,649
But I think I died, so. Phantom of the Opera bullets.

72
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,179
Oh, bot, Chris. Get lit up. Oh, that's a lot of BS right there.

73
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,240
I tried. I jumped on and got the jump on him. It didn't even matter.

74
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,419
What happened? What the hell is this guy doing? This guy is just sitting.

75
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,049
Oh, no, no, no. Like, heaven forbid, I steal one of yours.

76
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:00,350
Heaven forbid. Heaven forbid you steal, like, a dozen of mine.

77
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,590
Dude, you stole, like, a Crayola crayon box set worth of kills from me.

78
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,590
There was at least 12 in that box. I want my orange and I want my blue and purple back.

79
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,779
Oh, well, then I'm gonna scream.

80
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:29,080
Yeah, living room set, baby. Who wants it? 799? 799? 799?

81
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,700
Holy crap, no!

82
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,940
I think somebody's on knife.

83
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Yeah, it's almost the end of the game. You almost got me.

84
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,120
No! I could have gone that knife.

85
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm terrified right now. I'm terrified.

86
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Where is he? Yes!

87
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Did you get him? On the AFK.

88
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
I had to get it. There we go.

89
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,809
Well, I want to thank my parents for raising me properly.

90
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,809
I want to thank Jerma for being a good sport while I stole all his kills.

91
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,809
And Gigi, that's pretty much it.

92
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,809
That's pretty much it.

93
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,809
GG.
