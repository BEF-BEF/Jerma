1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,440
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some trouble in Terrorist Town, the mod for Garry's Mod and Counter-Strike Source.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Just wanted to briefly introduce this before the live stuff kicks in, because it can be very confusing if you're just watching this and have no idea what's going on.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
So I will try to clarify this a little bit before we get started.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,619
So essentially, it's kind of in the same category as Jailbreak, where it's just this enormous social experiment.

5
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,619
And I love stuff like this. It's one of the reasons I love Jailbreak so much.

6
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:44,619
And you're gonna see a lot more Jailbreak. You'll probably see a lot of this as well, this TTT. I think that's what people call it.

7
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:49,619
But so this is how it breaks down, right? You got three different people, three different types of people in this game.

8
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,619
You have innocents, traitors, and detectives.

9
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,619
So what you do, the whole point of the game, is to just stay alive.

10
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:02,619
If you're an innocent like I am in this game, the whole goal is to just not die and to try and get rid of all the traitors.

11
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:08,620
The traitors, their goal is to try and kill everybody without being seen and without being found out.

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:16,620
And the detectives, they are the exact same things as innocents, except they have a couple of things at their arsenal to try and track down the traitors.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,620
They have something, they have a DNA scanner and stuff like that.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,620
So it's cool to be either one of these things, because it really is just a giant show.

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:34,859
It's just a giant acting lesson. If you're a traitor, or even if you're an innocent, you have to try to find ways to convince your fellow man to not kill you.

16
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,859
So again, you have to have Counter-Strike Source and Garry's Mod to be able to play this game.

17
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:45,859
If you have these two, go check it out. And here comes a live session right here of just absolute nonsense.

18
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:49,859
So I'll see you guys all next time. Enjoy the live commentary and take care, everybody.

19
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,739
I'm with ass face and abusive.

20
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,739
I'm with ass face and abusive.

21
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,739
Okay, who's on the other side of that door?

22
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,739
Dude, you can trust me, you can trust me.

23
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,739
It's one of the detectives.

24
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,909
Who just shot the detective?

25
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,909
I don't know.

26
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,909
This is the scariest thing ever.

27
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,909
Get him, get him, kill him.

28
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,909
Kill Broby.

29
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,909
There's a chair out of the way.

30
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,909
Seriously, there's a chair out of the way.

31
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,909
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.

32
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,909
Get the chair out of the way.

33
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,409
Get the chair out of the way.

34
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,409
Broby killed the detective.

35
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,409
Cover me, I'm going to do some DNA scanning.

36
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,409
Was Broby a terrorist?

37
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:50,409
Yeah, Broby was a traitor, and she killed Rainbow Kitten, who was a detective.

38
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,409
Me and Jeremiah opened the door.

39
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,409
That's a DNA scanner.

40
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,409
I have DNA on you, too, if you did anything here.

41
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,409
Yeah, I killed the detective.

42
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,409
No, I mean the traitor.

43
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:07,409
I killed the detective.

44
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,409
No, I didn't do that.

45
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:11,409
I'm with abusive.

46
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,409
This Renegade, why is he badly wounded?

47
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,409
I'm with abusive in German.

48
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,409
They're locking me in.

49
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,030
I picked up a DNA scanner.

50
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,030
Renegade, Renegade, why are you badly wounded?

51
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,030
Where have you been?

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,340
Alright.

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Alright, Jerma, try to pick up this AWP right here.

54
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Drop your primary.

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
This doesn't work, this doesn't work.

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Traders don't get it.

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Really?

58
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Yeah, this doesn't work.

59
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
Are you sure this doesn't work?

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,699
What the hell is going on?

61
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,699
Oh my god, that's morbid.

62
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,699
I think there's someone missing.

63
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,699
Renne, why are you hurt?

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,699
I already asked him.

65
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,699
What?

66
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,699
I'm alone with Renegade.

67
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,699
You're not alone with anyone.

68
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,699
We're all here together.

69
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,699
I'm downstairs with Renegade.

70
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,699
We're in the bank.

71
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,699
He's trying to get away from me.

72
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,199
He's got his pistol out.

73
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
Jerma, you're alone with abusive now.

74
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
I'm alone with abusive right now.

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,100
We're being followed by abusive.

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,879
The man he's carrying.

77
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,879
I'm so fucked.

78
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,879
There has to be a traitor here.

79
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,879
I'm going to say that.

80
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,879
I think it's Jerma and it's not me.

81
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,879
Me too.

82
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
Nope, he's innocent.

83
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,180
Damn it.

84
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Wait a minute.

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,180
Alright, well.

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,180
What the fuck?

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,180
Where are you guys?

88
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,180
He was carrying around that body like a real creep.

89
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,680
Come on.

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Like it was a prize.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
I do not think that Jerma is the terrorist.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
He wouldn't have reacted that way to a detective dying.

93
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Believe it's stealth.

94
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
No, that's only when you're dead.

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
You can only see that when you're dead.

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
It's a real case of who done it.

97
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Second floor.

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
You guys go.

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Body here.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Is there anybody in here?

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
No.

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
They're not here.

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
We have to go downstairs in the elevator.

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's get in the elevator.

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
We're going into the elevator.

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
I don't know where we're at right now.

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
You want us to get in the elevator so bad.

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Good place to drop some C4.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Come with us.

110
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I would instant die if I did that.

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I wouldn't even be able to arm the C4 before you guys kill me.

112
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
What the hell is this?

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's get in the very confined elevator.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I believe that the map is bigger than we think.

115
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
If I die, she's dead.

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Don't leave yet Renegade.

117
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Renegade, don't you dare press that button.

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm shooting you.

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
We're going to wait for the others.

120
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
No, I lost you guys.

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I don't know where you guys went.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
We went back downstairs.

123
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,430
Don't you dare press that button Renegade.

124
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,430
Hulster your guns.

125
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
Hulster a gun.

126
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,430
We're all dead if we do that.

127
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,430
I did it.

128
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,430
It's alright.

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,430
Crowbar doesn't do any damage anyways.

130
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,430
What if this door opens

131
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,430
and people have guns in the other side?

132
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,430
What was that?

133
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
It was him.

134
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,430
It was Renegade.

135
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,430
Renegade.

136
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,430
It was Renegade.

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,430
It was Renegade.

138
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,430
The second the elevator doors opened

139
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,430
he shot Tio in the face and just ran.
