1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:14,070
All right. So, what? Uh, HillScent, thanks for the five community subs. Hill. Uh, what's- what do you- uh, what do you-

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:26,329
Eh, what do you guys want to do? I don't know if I want to do Jump King. I think I'm- might be too

3
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:47,219
wound up for that. Put in the two towers. Two towers! Let's go! Two towers! Let's go! Let's go! Two towers!

4
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:51,189
Oh shit!

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:18,329
Damn it. I like just fucked up my Xbox controller. Everything's full. What? Oh, it's all right.

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,709
It's good. It's okay. Okay. So, uh, did you hear that oh shit, by the way?

7
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:43,459
That was so weak. I was like, oh shit! Real voice. Two towers. You guys ready?

8
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:48,010
You said it and now we're going. I've- this is- this one is fucking awesome.

9
00:01:52,329 --> 00:02:05,420
I guarantee you, he's gonna like the first part of this game. Are we finally gonna watch Lord of

10
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:31,379
the Rings naked? Uh, no. We're not gonna watch Lord of the Rings naked. All right, let's get this on.

11
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:46,139
How does it look? Here we go! I gotta change the, uh, I gotta change this. This game is actually very-

12
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:54,580
God damn it. This game's actually very, very good. It's actually fantastic. Do not let the last game

13
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:08,229
sour you on this one because this one is actually fucking incredible. All right. All right. I gotta

14
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:25,960
get it. I gotta get there. The world has changed. Feel it in the water. Feel it in the earth. No,

15
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,919
this game is actually fucking one of the best games to come out on PlayStation 2.

16
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,039
It just- it's- it's got like the red banner at the top. It says classic PlayStation 2 game.

17
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:56,120
Yeah, I don't know. It actually is true. It began with the forging of the great rings.

18
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,159
Okay, this is just the beginning. Am I allowed to watch this?

19
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,379
I'm gonna get in trouble. This is the beginning of the movie.

20
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:19,779
Get your popcorn, guys. We're watching the movie. Who above all else desire power.

21
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,139
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.

22
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:36,660
But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. Yeah. In the land of Mordor,

23
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,819
in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all

24
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:52,579
others. And into this ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.

25
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,069
What is this nerd bullshit? What are you talking about? This is the greatest PlayStation 2 game.

26
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:07,370
Red banner. The free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some

27
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:15,000
who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor.

28
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,519
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought. Nerd bullshit. All right. All right. We I really

29
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:39,000
probably shouldn't do something. Literally just the movie. There's gonna be an algorithm

30
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,329
is going to find this screen and I'm going to get fucking my screen. Let's go.

31
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,819
This fuck is Harry.

32
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,850
I hate that shit, by the way. Anytime a video game pulls you out,

33
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:39,540
there's a huge, it's epic battle. You square to block. Like, no, don't just. Oh, wait. What do I

34
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:51,579
do? I wasn't looking. I wasn't looking. Shield attack. Look at this epic battle.

35
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:11,220
This combos in this game and shit. You want to listen RPG. There's RPG elements in this game. I

36
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:32,579
can't wait. I'm excited. Is there a dodge roll in this game? If that completes the four buttons,

37
00:07:32,579 --> 00:08:04,180
if there is. Let's go. R2 when they're on the ground. Yep. Oh, that was pretty sick. Good,

38
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:20,279
good, good, good, good. Did somebody just say your movie sucks? I didn't make this movie. Hey, dude,

39
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:45,509
I just like came to stream model. You know, your movie sucks. Oh, we go. This is the best part.

40
00:08:48,970 --> 00:09:07,590
It was in this moment. We get the movie again when all hope had faded.

41
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:17,639
Wait, wait, that was just that was just the piece PS2 one. I wish it was the PS2 render.

42
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:44,360
That would have been so much better. The enemy of the free peoples of middle earth was defeated.

43
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:54,330
The ring passed to Isildur who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. He didn't do it.

44
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,450
But the hearts of men are easily corrupted.

45
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:14,389
Oh, this is great. This is when actors get into the room in the audio booth

46
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,750
and they have glasses down on their nose at eight o'clock in the morning

47
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:28,809
and read every line like this. I am Isildur's era to me. Let's go. Next page.

48
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:48,519
It is read. All right, let's go. Good. Mission experience 711. Save the game. Game one, game

49
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:57,179
10, game two, one, game one. This game is crusty. It's very good, though. It's very, very, very good.

50
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:06,649
Harry in order to block enemy attacks with black arrows. It's a classic game.

51
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:25,259
Visengard is empty. It is an army bred for one purpose, to destroy the world of men.

52
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:48,019
Ring. Oh, oh. Boss fight. They seek the ring bearer. Stay close.

53
00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:15,909
Wait, where's Broto? Can I lock on? How do I put fire on here? All right, I got it. I got it. How

54
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:25,500
do I swing with the other hand? Light it up. Fire. How do I swing the other hand? All right,

55
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:39,940
it's on. It's on fire now. There is definitely a lock on. It has to be. I know there is. Is there

60
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,940

screen half of the movie

86
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:50,789

whatever all right here we go we can go down photographs of characters and scenery

165
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:11,190
what do you mean is this this is not a level is it just production stuff what is this it's just

166
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:29,210
pictures it's just photos of the set well there they are as we just did that

167

the quest stands upon the edge of a knife straight but a little and it will fail but it

172
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:08,500
would become darker still for a fellowship was failing i would have gone with you to the end

01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:48,569
we would not abandon our companions to torment and death for days we followed their trail

258
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:38,420
vvvvv is a good game um that's the where you the gravity one right that's pretty cool

259
01:14:38,420 --> 01:15:04,569
it just got released open source i always imagine that's probably so what does that

260
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:09,130
so people can now just essentially have the entire game's code to be able to make their own

261
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:13,529
levels or what's the benefit of doing that what do you make you can only make like a sequel or

262
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:19,180
something make your own levels make your own game essentially in the game it's on github that's

263
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:38,140
crazy i wonder what the legality of that stuff really is i guess if you self-publish right what's

264

689
03:41:55,430 --> 03:42:09,690

and over again what do you mean ignore entire left side it actually seems like it's working out

708
03:47:55,459 --> 03:48:05,129
imagine ignoring the entire left side and that's what you had to do imagine there's there's so many

709
03:48:05,129 --> 03:48:12,889
ladders why don't we uh here's an idea guys why don't you dump gasoline where they're putting

710
03:48:12,889 --> 03:48:20,500
the ladders down and drop a match um why not you just start dropping the anvils over the edge

711
03:48:21,829 --> 03:48:46,389
go wire up a few pianos and drop them over the edge okay here we go here we go

712
03:48:52,870 --> 03:48:59,780
just sit there and drop anvil just have a guy being a huh huh guys

713
03:49:08,870 --> 03:49:15,209
um

714
03:49:19,659 --> 03:49:29,690
i got hit by a boulder then i got hit right the fucking head by a boulder

715
03:49:30,250 --> 03:49:35,129
stick to the plan that's i can't even stick to the plan there's too many there's too many

716
03:49:48,340 --> 03:50:02,280
curvy um so they shoot boulders bar goes immediately to red game over there is the

717
03:50:02,280 --> 03:50:10,680
horse and the rider i got two there are enough for the top youtube search i just watched this

718
03:50:11,399 --> 03:50:17,319
what does this say so the top youtube search i just watched for this mission is from 2015

719
03:50:17,319 --> 03:50:20,920
doing basically the same thing you're doing by focusing the ladders they don't get swarmed

720
03:50:20,920 --> 03:50:26,360
nearly as much as you so i i have as you have so i hate to say that i think you're just getting

721
03:50:26,360 --> 03:50:38,340
unlucky no i'm not getting unlucky all right only ladders okay every time i swing the axe i give

722
03:50:38,340 --> 03:51:11,420
10 community subs he's faking his own hype train move out of the fucking way that was a good start

723
03:51:11,420 --> 03:51:44,149
too but it was ruined by the standing people they were trying to get in my way it's like they're

724
03:51:44,149 --> 03:52:21,059
trying to get in my way it's yeah we're playing football now get out of my way get out of my way

725
03:52:25,579 --> 03:52:38,649
i didn't swing no swinging i did this game when i was nine lies lies lies surrounded by lies

726
03:52:38,649 --> 03:53:07,479
surrounded by them i wonder if jerma still likes the lord of the rings after this

727
03:53:09,459 --> 03:53:41,770
that's pretty good series uh all right come on two on the right

728
03:53:45,590 --> 03:54:07,209
don't i hosted that's what i was waiting for this shit i don't care i don't care i don't care i have

729
03:54:07,209 --> 03:54:56,540
to kill this guy good i had to kill that guy i really did that's not a swing that's a push

730
03:54:56,540 --> 03:55:24,469
that was a push not a swing that was a push don't twist it oh no no no no no no

731
03:55:25,909 --> 03:55:32,299
no no the yellow bar no no

732
03:55:47,100 --> 03:56:22,780
fucking ice these motherfuckers come on ice them ice of aragon this body's in the way aragon

733
03:56:22,780 --> 03:56:41,219
ice these motherfuckers please ice these motherfuckers wasn't there a part three that's

734
03:56:41,219 --> 03:56:46,500
supposed to happen here like right now wasn't there supposed to be a part three that happens

735
03:56:46,500 --> 03:57:02,649
right now why is this taking so long okay here we go only ladders just knock down the ladders

736
03:57:03,290 --> 03:57:20,500
here we go it's gonna instantly turn red i'm trying to push the ladder you fucking dick

737
03:57:21,620 --> 03:57:30,920
just push it down man i got stun locked i got stun locked i am about to oh my god i got

738
03:57:30,920 --> 03:57:42,979
stun locked by this fucking motherfucker right next to me oh my god it's this is the worst

739
03:57:44,100 --> 03:57:50,979
look at how many people are up here there's no way i'm gonna be doing this there's no way i can't

740
03:57:50,979 --> 03:58:19,180
even do that is anybody gonna kill somebody up here so it came back and i got stun locked by the

741
03:58:19,180 --> 03:58:28,860
way is is there in the most celebrated franchise in human history is there a reason why catapults

742
03:58:28,860 --> 03:59:00,469
launch and then the bar fills to red in eight seconds how did actual gimli do this this is

743
03:59:00,469 --> 03:59:06,870
based on history god i wonder how did how did they do this back thousand years ago

744
03:59:10,819 --> 03:59:17,540
guys i don't know i'm supposed to stick to the plan but let's be completely honest i'm not sure

745
03:59:17,540 --> 03:59:31,770
that plans i'm not sure it's a sound plan anymore that's the furthest we've made it we make it to

746
03:59:31,770 --> 03:59:39,100
there every time and then everybody just there's a thousand people on the screen try the left instead

747
03:59:39,100 --> 03:59:56,010
where is the horse should have just built up aerodrome i shouldn't have to do that

748
03:59:59,829 --> 04:00:46,500
i'm just here for the free sub well what is it at 30 this area okay this area needed

749
04:00:46,500 --> 04:00:53,459
this area needs is is over tweaked it needs to be under tweaked there is this is this is over tweaked

750
04:00:53,459 --> 04:01:07,739
it needs to be under tweaked how is the right left side been doing that poorly i have enough

751
04:01:07,739 --> 04:01:30,500
time to get left at least the first one that's in one why it's like every time there's a cut

752
04:01:30,500 --> 04:01:37,989
scene the game continues to load the enemies that's what's happening whenever we whenever we see a

753
04:01:37,989 --> 04:01:53,129
cut scene it's still loading ladders and people in here but the ladders don't matter it's the

754
04:01:53,129 --> 04:01:59,610
amount of orcs on the wall yeah but if there's ladders up i can't kill them uh you get a

755
04:01:59,690 --> 04:02:05,610
completely overrun what's supposed to happen is player a runs around and hits ladders and stays

756
04:02:05,610 --> 04:02:11,049
on the left side and player b runs around on the right side and hits ladders and kills enemies on

757
04:02:11,049 --> 04:02:26,200
the right side my player b is standing over here swinging at the same two orcs i don't even have

758
04:02:26,200 --> 04:02:48,979
another controller to plug in i fucked it up i fucked it up no sorry salvageable that spawn

759
04:02:48,979 --> 04:03:15,350
right next to me on the right salvaged everything right at the middle left side right side here it

760
04:03:15,350 --> 04:03:26,780
comes ready one two one two one two one two come on oh my god it's just a game it's just a football

761
04:03:26,780 --> 04:03:31,659
game it really is they just they just it's three or four of them on the screen at the same time

762
04:03:32,219 --> 04:03:44,200
and they take up almost all of the real estate on screen the left side if you have time i'm not

763
04:03:44,200 --> 04:03:54,379
sure i ever will first time i've fallen because that guy backed up look see he's doing a great

764
04:03:54,379 --> 04:04:22,940
job walking around maybe collapsed on he's toxic to teammates well tell them to push a ladder down

765
04:04:25,379 --> 04:04:33,479
even if they did it once if one of these ai pushed one ladder to the ground one

766
04:04:34,280 --> 04:04:48,459
i'd probably be why is this this there's so many people up here right now but i'm not i don't

767
04:04:48,459 --> 04:04:56,860
understand why only two ladders are up fuck that's that doesn't count that was a recovery

768
04:05:07,479 --> 04:05:14,649
god damn it i just got so screwed the less the left side i can't as the left side of all

769
04:05:14,649 --> 04:05:35,559
is left side done as the left the left side might be fucking toast push the ladder oh my god

770
04:05:36,840 --> 04:05:42,360
block that's block that was a block you guys i think seriously seriously there's so many

771
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:49,100
people on the screen that you can't even walk to the ladder these are blocks these are blocks

772
04:05:49,899 --> 04:06:14,090
i'm gonna watch is there a speedrun of this anyone played this fucking game

773
04:06:14,090 --> 04:06:21,510
to a to a point where they want to speed run this painful shit two towers helms deep speed run

774
04:06:22,709 --> 04:06:32,229
how the fuck does anyone reliably do this um let's see i want to see this skip to helms deep

775
04:06:32,790 --> 04:06:55,659
what the hell do they even do it's okay if it's too hard jermal i just want to see i guarantee you

776
04:06:56,379 --> 04:07:01,659
who wants to make some bets here i'll make a bet with you this is a speed run of this game

777
04:07:01,659 --> 04:07:08,059
in 47 minutes i guarantee you i will gift another 10 subs if during this this guy doesn't go

778
04:07:08,780 --> 04:07:49,260
stupid fucking part of the game you ready no i this is all wrong oh that's why it's doing that

779
04:07:49,260 --> 04:07:52,120
okay all right makes sense okay

780
04:08:26,790 --> 04:08:28,229
there are enough for us both ghibli

781
04:08:31,270 --> 04:08:38,860
right look at it right now he's going the fuck out of the way he's there's no mic

782
04:08:40,139 --> 04:09:06,260
he goes left too guys he goes left he doesn't he goes left he has not swung the sword once

783
04:09:06,899 --> 04:09:32,229
so far he just i feel like i'm doing this faster than this doing it in order

784
04:09:33,750 --> 04:09:45,049
wait in order of what do you mean in order is he fasting is is he faster running animation don't

785
04:09:45,049 --> 04:09:56,709
even tell me that's what it is no it's not wait ghibli has a slower running it's ghibli is actually

786
04:09:56,709 --> 04:10:23,159
a slower character no no way i don't believe that for a second 100 you ignore the left two

787
04:10:23,159 --> 04:10:34,700
ladders i feel like i'm doing i'm doing it the same way i'm doing it the same way no he's not

788
04:10:34,700 --> 04:10:47,209
ignoring the other ladder this is like the world record holder he's taking out the two left but

789
04:10:47,209 --> 04:11:06,979
that's legolas no it's not legolas doesn't have a two-handed sword he's doing it in a pre-determined

790
04:11:06,979 --> 04:11:14,840
order so should i just be doing it as they pop up all right so let's see the right just popped

791
04:11:14,840 --> 04:11:24,540
up right there does he run all the way across to the right side he does he's doing them in the order

792
04:11:24,540 --> 04:11:31,979
that they're popping up is it yeah he he's skipped that other one that all right no see what he did

793
04:11:31,979 --> 04:11:38,659
see what just happened there he's doing it in the order they pop up not in the order that they're

794
04:11:38,659 --> 04:11:53,739
in the way he's doing it no he's not he's just doing the closest one he's not the middle was

795
04:11:53,739 --> 04:12:03,219
up for ages he's just knocking them down as they pop up i swear to god if it's because ghibli is

796
04:12:03,219 --> 04:12:30,809
like seven percent slower i'm gonna be real angry he upgraded the character ghibli's upgraded too

797
04:12:31,770 --> 04:12:41,510
about that there's no speed upgrade there are two ladders near each other he goes there instead

798
04:12:41,510 --> 04:12:49,100
of wasting time going all the way down the middle so he's genuinely doing them as they pop up

799
04:12:51,180 --> 04:12:57,350
all right i'm gonna i'm going aragon i'm gonna try it let's go i think i got it

800
04:13:03,219 --> 04:13:39,989
i think i got it i'm going aragon boys and girls you ready let's go let's say check the

801
04:13:39,989 --> 04:13:43,750
description on the video there's no fucking way this person's watching the stream where is the

802
04:13:43,750 --> 04:13:55,879
horse and the rider where is the horn that is blowing i got two there are enough for us both

803
04:13:55,879 --> 04:14:34,729
ghibli he's way faster he's way faster than ghibli it's not even a fucking contest you gotta be

804
04:14:34,729 --> 04:14:40,889
kidding me did i seriously waste all that fucking time because i was playing as the character that

805
04:14:40,889 --> 04:14:45,370
was a little bit slower than everybody else no way i is this just is this like a placebo effect

806
04:14:46,090 --> 04:15:08,500
i feel like it's like five times as many people on the screen am i getting placebo

807
04:15:27,819 --> 04:15:40,250
um this this just feels just different like this just feels different to me i don't know what drugs

808
04:15:40,250 --> 04:16:08,969
i'm on but this is different you know what i'm saying let's ignore the left side i think he is

809
04:16:09,610 --> 04:17:10,420
he is right i'm not going crazy right thanks for getting in my way everybody um come on i need some

810
04:17:10,420 --> 04:17:47,299
spawns that was incredibly inefficient it's okay i'm at zero bar i swear to god get the fuck out

811
04:17:47,299 --> 04:18:12,280
of my way you punk one guy spinning around in goddamn circles you might you're not really

812
04:18:12,280 --> 04:18:25,129
gonna let this fucking happen are you get out of the way how did that not hit how did that not hit

813
04:18:25,129 --> 04:18:32,760
and i'm blocking i'm not swinging i'm blocking i don't want to i'm level two is aragon guys i

814
04:18:32,760 --> 04:18:58,520
can't take like two hits fucking god there's only three ladders up how the fuck did this many people

815
04:18:58,520 --> 04:19:16,860
out right now oh god i'm gonna fucking puke i really am so many people over here i'm gonna

816
04:19:16,860 --> 04:19:30,620
get hit and die blocking is not running when you parry it doesn't do anything it's you don't even

817
04:19:30,620 --> 04:19:34,700
get a second of like hip recovery you just don't take damage it doesn't do anything else

818
04:19:35,340 --> 04:19:55,930
i'm fucked i had to do it i'm getting a fucking run the same shit keeps fucking happening to me

819
04:20:02,809 --> 04:20:05,370
right side right side right right right right right right right come on aragon go

820
04:20:06,090 --> 04:20:40,100
here we go all right all right now don't fuck this up damn it there's so many people i'm telling you

821
04:20:40,100 --> 04:20:50,680
during the fucking cutscenes it continues i'm stuck in the corner jesus christ give me the help

822
04:20:51,319 --> 04:21:06,659
please don't you even fucking dare i'm being you're all body blocking right now and it's driving me

823
04:21:06,659 --> 04:21:22,969
mad what just what the fuck just happened what just happened i insta died i instantly fucking

824
04:21:22,969 --> 04:21:29,129
died what the fuck just happened i was trying to dodge and not get and and excuse that's the

825
04:21:29,129 --> 04:21:35,209
first time that's ever happened that's the first time that's ever fucking happened i got instantly

826
04:21:35,209 --> 04:21:39,530
killed by what was it what did i die it shot a fireball at you i should have five but wasn't

827
04:21:39,530 --> 04:22:06,020
i standing behind them i got catapulted i it was because i was alongside the wall i did better

828
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:11,139
that time with aragon do i really have to go back and play all these fucking levels again with this

829
04:22:11,139 --> 04:22:28,360
dude i don't why is this nine straight minutes i honestly don't believe you can try change this

830
04:22:28,520 --> 04:22:55,209
i guarantee you won't beat helms deep part one he bought the game for this no i didn't

831
04:22:56,469 --> 04:23:19,620
one of the best ps2 games yeah i why don't you attack because it's an inefficient use of time

832
04:23:20,340 --> 04:23:30,870
for some reason and i don't know why attacking any any orc on this cliff is an inefficient use

833
04:23:30,870 --> 04:23:39,940
of any of even one second of your time we just watched the world record speed run but the dude

834
04:23:39,940 --> 04:23:47,129
just runs around in circles 10 more minutes till the next height the speed runner attacked and i

835
04:23:47,129 --> 04:23:56,299
also i we're going left we're going right side i got i just got hit directly in the head with one

836
04:23:56,299 --> 04:24:03,100
of those and it didn't kill me it was because i got hit with a giant catapult in the fucking head

837
04:24:15,270 --> 04:24:24,860
i think i may have unlocked the ultimate strategy no i didn't never mind it's too sloppy to be able

838
04:24:24,860 --> 04:24:37,610
to do that no that's not gonna work this tube there's too much body collision to even attempt

839
04:24:37,610 --> 04:25:17,030
to attack a person up here i was gonna okay one of this one spawned over here so i was like you

840
04:25:17,030 --> 04:25:39,799
know what fucking i'm going this way that's stuck stuck stuck awesome it didn't even it got the one

841
04:25:39,799 --> 04:25:44,280
time that the motherfucker doesn't swing for three straight seconds that always just spinning in a

842
04:25:44,280 --> 04:25:51,159
circle randomly flailing around trying to hit anything and that one time am i gonna get hit

843
04:25:51,159 --> 04:26:16,299
by more of this shit am i gonna it's been eight hours how am i screaming i've been serving eight

844
04:26:16,299 --> 04:26:35,700
hours holy shit i thought it was like four i'm gonna die i can't like i'm fucking dead i'm dead

845
04:26:35,700 --> 04:26:41,540
wish i could see the right side of the screen right now you know what a fucking miracle god

895
04:40:22,950 --> 04:40:30,069

897
04:40:41,080 --> 04:40:49,779
why did i pick him like yes he is according to the wiki and it feels slower i have to

898
04:40:53,860 --> 04:41:35,130
oh this level is very quick and it's just a boss and it's like 10 15 000 experience oh by the way

899
04:41:35,130 --> 04:41:44,310
joel if you're watching i'm not sure we're gonna be doing a screen tomorrow wrong screen i got it

900

you can see you can see just give me my experience and do the health upgrades and then just run

902
04:42:06,069 --> 04:42:17,939
fear the lies and god only germa stopped after the first game to defuse bombs

903
04:42:18,900 --> 04:42:33,560
all right and there's also a certain threshold where i'm completely out of gas too

904
04:42:34,279 --> 04:42:37,080
i may have already hit that yeah i think it may have i think i hit there already

how to set up a fucking proper compressor on his microphone so every half second you hear

1303
06:39:40,220 --> 06:39:44,060

1322
06:45:35,400 --> 06:46:20,840
quantum computing this mission reminds me of when you go into gary's mod and you just spawned like

1323
06:46:20,840 --> 06:46:27,830
20 scientists versus like 40 fucking ant lines and you just look and just watch from

1324
06:46:27,830 --> 06:46:47,299
100 feet above all right here we go roger seems that they've made it into the store

1327
06:47:50,569 --> 06:48:08,919
i mean i don't have combos but it's it's kind of hard to even see what where what what direction

1328
06:48:08,919 --> 06:48:18,459
my weapon is even swinging i could block square you know our xr2 i got the battle of home depot

1329
06:48:18,459 --> 06:48:48,919
in front of me get rid of all the shields that didn't kill you all right here we go legolas

1330
06:48:49,560 --> 06:48:59,689

1337
06:52:02,439 --> 06:52:32,729

1340
06:53:12,169 --> 06:53:21,560

1341
06:53:22,439 --> 06:53:30,540
well we can't really see anywhere where i just i have no view of anything actually roger

1342
06:53:31,500 --> 06:53:39,700

1352
06:56:27,270 --> 06:57:03,290
hey you ready for the nearly impossible level i guess so but i guess so i'll be honest though

1353
06:57:03,290 --> 06:57:07,130
like imagine watching the lord of the rings and aragon drops on his ass this many times you'd be

1354
06:57:07,130 --> 06:57:33,580
like this movie sucks look how many times i'm just getting knocked on the ground this is what it looks

1355
06:57:33,580 --> 06:57:50,840
like when you fail every qte get it get it get it get it get it i have a perfect you should be dead

1381
07:04:02,150 --> 07:04:14,869

1449
07:23:28,459 --> 07:24:16,889
oh look at us doing a great job keep it up thumbs up wink this game has an average playtime of six

1450
07:24:16,889 --> 07:24:24,729
hours for the main story fuck that yeah right liars bullshit you've seen you look at what's

1451
07:24:24,729 --> 07:24:28,970
happening on screen right now and you think somebody's gonna beat this in less than five

1452
07:24:28,970 --> 07:24:52,709
or six hours that's horseshit what happened was this what happened to that guy all right are

1455
07:25:23,340 --> 07:25:36,650
right now do you understand like it's all these super powered motherfuckers five hours by the way

1456
07:25:37,529 --> 07:25:47,130
this is like playing dark souls against 60 people at the same fucking time no way you took five

1457
07:25:47,130 --> 07:26:05,240
hours to beat this i refuse to understand or believe you i have to get to level 10 or it's

1458
07:26:06,040 --> 07:26:26,650
actually impossible how a level 10 fix it i don't know it gets me away from having to see the same

1459
07:26:26,650 --> 07:26:35,259
smudged smeared across screen of 100 people swinging and falling down it lets me break it

1460
07:26:35,259 --> 07:27:18,099
up a little somebody said back when games were hard back when games were hard just do combos

1461
07:27:18,099 --> 07:27:29,900
i'm doing the two or three combos that i have here are my combos here's the other one you've

1462
07:27:29,900 --> 07:27:37,689
seen me do that move 500 times the walkthrough for this level starts with oh my sweet loving god

1463
07:27:37,689 --> 07:27:46,700
this mission is so hard it makes the previous two missions look easy why is he not let's go blow

1464
07:27:46,700 --> 07:28:02,790
you're wasting time gandalf how did you beat this as a kid guys i may have just gotten to like the

1465
07:28:02,869 --> 07:28:29,909
second level and gone well this is fun i like lord of rings sorry about your tables all right

1466
07:28:29,909 --> 07:28:36,310

1467
07:28:37,189 --> 07:29:16,340
with a couple of slashes you just don't have oh man get out of my move move move move move

1468
07:29:16,979 --> 07:29:48,380
oh sorry we have to get in the way slaughter this motherfucker i think i'm stuck in the wall

1469
07:29:49,020 --> 07:30:05,779
i'm stuck in the wall there we go i found a way out that's what i wanted so i can kill you in one

1470
07:30:05,779 --> 07:30:28,009
hit is this hit and run too it might as well be this might be harder than hitting run

1471
07:30:30,279 --> 07:30:42,299
where i'm almost of the whole trilogy almost why is there a family photo in the top right

1472
07:30:42,299 --> 07:30:55,189
corner because i have to save the people in the building we've peaked too early in the year what

1473
07:30:55,189 --> 07:30:58,470
do you mean we peaked too early all right i have to i don't know they're gonna die if i don't do

1474
07:30:58,470 --> 07:31:28,860
this right now oh damn it they swing they swing so much faster than i do and the family's dead

1475
07:31:28,860 --> 07:31:35,340
where are these family members where are you are you just standing around waiting to die

1476
07:31:36,299 --> 07:31:47,509
where even are you did you just let these guys kill you blocking doesn't do anything trust me

1477
07:31:48,700 --> 07:32:02,680
trust me when you block it you just it's easy you can block against one guy but when you're

1478
07:32:02,680 --> 07:32:28,330
surrounded by 12 people you're gonna get smoked i just dropped my mouse who cares not even level

1479
07:32:28,330 --> 07:32:46,220
10 by the way do i get my upgrade screen all right what the hell am i buying but look at how

1480
07:32:46,220 --> 07:32:55,610
long this move takes to kill one person one two three four it's almost five full seconds

1481
07:33:00,009 --> 07:33:12,779
it's an instant kill but it takes i'm doing i got it there you go i got it how am i going

1482
07:33:12,779 --> 07:33:21,720
to pull this off in the sea of fucking humans don't you guys remember the hobbit sneaking game

1483
07:33:22,439 --> 07:33:37,000
what happened to that so i can instant kill in uruk-hai and instant kill any orc in the whole

1484
07:33:37,000 --> 07:33:43,880
game i have to block press x and then r2 it should kill instantly kill every single work in the whole

1485
07:33:43,880 --> 07:34:06,729
game that's i'll try i probably should have picked another level to practice it we didn't

1486
07:34:06,729 --> 07:34:30,700
yell fake rumbo's name fake rumbo okay so block and then x r2 okay you just you see how long this

1487

is gonna take to do this to every single one of these guys one by one glad i picked it

1488
07:35:08,869 --> 07:35:12,330
no it's a waste of time i'm gonna do what i was doing before

1489
07:35:58,180 --> 07:36:07,349

1491
07:37:09,909 --> 07:37:21,509
helmsley for five full days you know it would be nice uh the kingdom of men dwarves and elves

1492
07:37:21,509 --> 07:38:13,500
if you sent more than three people that'd be great oh we're being attacked we're being overrun by orcs

1493
07:38:14,299 --> 07:38:19,819
it's okay we have three people oh what how many how many how many were there

1504
07:41:49,029 --> 07:42:08,310

07:42:08,310 --> 07:42:19,659
we cannot hold sounds about right you thought jump king was hard

1506
07:42:25,139 --> 07:42:31,939

crazy bill fuck that move again it's like a lantern in the way

1509
07:43:40,919 --> 07:43:47,400
instant kill pauses ai but it doesn't pause people hitting the shelf with their swords

1510

fucking mutants look at the there's like 10 of these guys they're like unstoppable it's the

1521
07:47:50,470 --> 07:47:59,590
hardest enemy in the game and they're like just lining up they're super mutants if only i had an

1522
07:47:59,590 --> 07:48:13,349
instant kill it's so oh just do the instant kill i can't even tell what's happening on the screen

07:48:13,430 --> 07:48:24,340
it's this one fucking guy the guys that you can't kill you can't swing at these guys

1524
07:48:25,669 --> 07:48:42,220
where am i what the fuck is happening this is out fucking for ages this is out this is worse than

1525
07:48:42,220 --> 07:48:50,630
gary's mod gary's mod what the shit can't even happen there's like ai ceilings there's literally

1526
07:48:50,709 --> 07:48:55,080
ai ceilings in gary's book too many processes going on the same time

1527
07:48:57,740 --> 07:49:19,349
imagine playing this on anything other than normal holy fuck holy here come the trolls to

1528
07:49:19,349 --> 07:49:23,750
break it down instantly stick to the plan there is no plan you can't have a plan when there's

1529
07:49:23,750 --> 07:49:30,389
a hundred people spamming moves spamming at you on the screen there's no plan there is no plan

1530
07:49:30,389 --> 07:50:03,659
where are the trolls where are the trolls where are the trolls did i can you imagine putting it

1531
07:50:03,659 --> 07:50:12,759
on this that there's there what on earth would you have it on there for you want to just do it

1532
07:50:12,759 --> 07:50:38,169
for once just try it let's try it let's see what happens when the game's on expert do they swing

1533
07:50:38,169 --> 07:50:44,919
twice as fast do they have twice as much health does the wall have 50 left health left left health

1534
07:50:45,720 --> 07:51:26,869
the only thing i notice is the frame rate is worse you can't the shield doesn't break in one hit

1535
07:51:29,290 --> 07:51:44,700
what kind of mistake is that you know i'm saying it's a shield what kind of mistake

1536
07:52:08,310 --> 07:52:35,220
why have i not taken a single point of damage and now i have aragon he's stuck as my favorite

1537
07:52:35,220 --> 07:52:41,060
scene in one of the rings where aragon fell down every half second and when he spammed square in

1538
07:52:41,060 --> 07:52:41,860
the middle of people like this

1539
07:53:22,569 --> 07:53:52,250

08:03:27,259 --> 08:03:39,450

1571
08:03:39,450 --> 08:03:45,049
a wall as hard as you can spinning around a circle 10 times and then picking up a playstation 2

1607
08:15:06,889 --> 08:15:13,450
hard to do that when the screen is shaking and the screen is filled with bodies like i can't even

it's just it's like 10 out of 10 out fucking rage just cheese it stand on the stairs okay

anywhere he's not coming down this he's thought he's literally not going to come down these stairs

1622
08:25:16,939 --> 08:26:02,840

1634
08:35:53,349 --> 08:35:58,549
i never thought i would be do i'll be doing this right now but like just out of principle i want

1635
08:35:58,549 --> 08:36:17,340
to beat this game right out of principle stay up here stay up here and fucking let the screen

1636
08:36:17,340 --> 08:36:22,599
shake by the way can i just say that screen shake is the shittiest thing that anyone has ever put

1637
08:36:22,599 --> 08:36:26,919
in their games why do you don't put don't get why do you put it even why is it in any game

1638
08:36:27,959 --> 08:36:37,590
at what point do you say hey like this game's kind of fun maybe we should shake the person's

1639
08:36:37,590 --> 08:36:46,540
screen like nobody everyone turns it off if it's available to turn off has anyone figured that out

1640
08:36:46,540 --> 08:37:05,369
yet in the gaming industry i turned off uh katana zero screen shake is it zero percent same with

1641
08:37:05,450 --> 08:37:10,700
motion blur i just don't get it is it to like hide the fact that like your game sucks

1642
08:37:11,659 --> 08:37:14,439
is that like why people do like a shit load of motion blur and stuff

1643
08:37:24,549 --> 08:37:31,139
yes because you don't want to see the trees popping in when they turn around too quickly

1644
08:37:50,810 --> 08:38:01,770
the arch is here yet i need health oh my fucking god need health all right i got some

1649
08:39:19,400 --> 08:39:35,909
why is this game so hard because up until 2004 people were just putting random code into the

1650
08:39:35,909 --> 08:39:47,930
engine and going oh shit i guess that works oh my god don't die don't die don't die at legolas

08:48:57,080 --> 08:49:19,580

1676
08:49:31,270 --> 08:49:41,830
just hanging out after you help legolas go back down to the gate i don't i i don't know the gate

1677
08:49:41,830 --> 08:49:49,909

08:49:49,909 --> 08:49:54,389
the arches and then well no no no no yes you don't you don't you talk about it yeah i know

1679
08:49:54,389 --> 08:49:57,669

08:49:58,549 --> 08:50:35,270
i i know what you mean like i like hands are getting stuck

1681
08:50:42,419 --> 08:50:44,099
like i was underneath my desk

1682
08:50:52,819 --> 08:51:16,439

1685
08:51:54,569 --> 08:52:11,270
i'm saying i need health how many fucking people have to die here until this ship can i need a

1695
08:55:00,259 --> 08:55:04,419

1696
08:55:05,299 --> 08:55:15,340

1700
08:56:42,259 --> 08:56:47,029
I did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did

1701
08:56:47,029 --> 08:56:49,029
I did it I did it I did it!

1702
08:56:51,849 --> 08:56:53,849
I did it I did it I did it

1703
08:56:54,909 --> 08:56:59,900
I did it I did it

1704
08:57:00,020 --> 08:57:07,840
Did I do it?

1705
08:57:07,900 --> 08:57:09,900
Is there another part to this?

1706
08:57:23,259 --> 08:57:24,619
I don't know

1707
08:57:28,110 --> 08:57:33,340
YES!

1708
08:57:33,819 --> 08:57:35,819
I don't have to do it anymore

1709
08:57:36,259 --> 08:57:39,040
Oh man its over

1710
08:57:47,060 --> 08:57:51,150
It's over. It's over. It's over.

1711
08:57:51,150 --> 08:57:54,580
Sauron and Saruman are titans.

1712
08:57:54,580 --> 08:57:57,580
Sauron and Saruman are dead.

1713
08:57:57,580 --> 08:58:05,080
But for all that we have won over, the ring remains hidden.

1714
08:58:05,080 --> 08:58:07,080
Let's take a look and see what I look like.

1715
08:58:07,080 --> 08:58:09,450
That we should seek to destroy it.

1716
08:58:09,450 --> 08:58:10,450
How do I look?

1717
08:58:10,450 --> 08:58:21,180
So the weapon of the hands of a hobbit each day brings it closer to the fires of Mandu.

1718
08:58:21,180 --> 08:58:24,889
Sauron fears you.

1719
08:58:24,889 --> 08:58:53,799
Is this the Shmeagol music?

1720
08:58:53,799 --> 08:58:54,799
You look hungry.

1721
08:58:54,799 --> 08:59:10,659
I am hungry.

1722
08:59:10,659 --> 08:59:13,659
The fucking Gollum music had to play the second I turned the camera on.

1723
08:59:13,659 --> 08:59:14,659
Give me a break.

1724
08:59:14,659 --> 08:59:33,540
I don't know what I even...

1725
08:59:33,540 --> 08:59:35,540
Nice mic noises. I know, I'm sorry.

1726
08:59:35,540 --> 08:59:41,299
Okay, so...

1727
08:59:41,299 --> 08:59:44,180
Wait, is that not the end of the game?

1728
08:59:44,180 --> 09:00:00,930
How is that not the end of the game?

1729
09:00:00,930 --> 09:00:07,759
I don't think I want anything else.

1730
09:00:07,759 --> 09:00:08,759
I guess I'll get this.

1731
09:00:08,759 --> 09:00:15,659
I told you I was going to do it.

1732
09:00:15,659 --> 09:00:18,659
I told you I was going to get past the first part of Fellowship of the Ring.

1733
09:00:18,659 --> 09:00:21,959
That's right. Fake Grumbo.

1734
09:00:21,959 --> 09:00:44,580
I told you I was going to do it.

1735
09:00:44,580 --> 09:00:47,819
I want my two dollars from you, fake Grumbo.

1736
09:00:47,819 --> 09:00:50,310
Although I made that part up.

1737
09:00:50,310 --> 09:00:52,310
You don't have to give me any money.

1738
09:00:52,310 --> 09:01:10,349
The process of the video game construction and the building of it...

1739
09:01:10,349 --> 09:01:13,349
is not made for fighting things.

1740
09:01:13,349 --> 09:01:16,349
Vigo, you didn't get to fucking Helm's Deep. Give me a break.

1741
09:01:16,349 --> 09:01:19,590
I'm surprised. I mean, it looks much more realistic.

1742
09:01:19,590 --> 09:01:24,479
It seems it goes to another level.

1743
09:01:24,479 --> 09:01:27,479
If you got to Helm's Deep, you'd probably be like, I refuse the interview.

1744
09:01:27,479 --> 09:01:38,380
I think Aragorn's aim video game is better than my outfit.

1745
09:01:38,380 --> 09:01:40,380
You sound so tired.

1746
09:01:40,380 --> 09:01:46,779
I'm glad I did it.

1747
09:01:46,779 --> 09:01:53,779
What I've seen of the video game seems to reflect the fact that the second movie, as opposed to the first one, is on a bigger scale.

1748
09:01:53,779 --> 09:01:57,779
And I'm looking forward to seeing them just as I am to seeing the rest of this game.

1749
09:01:57,779 --> 09:02:00,779
I've only seen a sample today.

1750
09:02:00,779 --> 09:02:07,560
I'm glad to see, for example, that sometimes Aragorn gets knocked over or falls down or rolls around.

1751
09:02:07,560 --> 09:02:13,569
And that his fighting style alters to fit the situation.

1752
09:02:13,569 --> 09:02:16,569
It's not always neat and tidy.

1753
09:02:16,569 --> 09:02:19,569
He falls down.

1754
09:02:19,569 --> 09:02:22,569
I love it when he falls down.

1755
09:02:22,569 --> 09:02:29,340
That's true. That's true. I like it when he falls down.

1756
09:02:29,340 --> 09:02:34,180
Somebody said he hates it.

1757
09:02:34,180 --> 09:02:37,180
Did you know Vigo Mortensen hates the game?

1758
09:02:37,180 --> 09:02:40,060
Wait, was that sarcastic?

1759
09:02:40,060 --> 09:02:45,060
Well, you know, I really love when he falls down and has to change and gets shit kicked out of him.

1760
09:02:45,060 --> 09:02:56,709
I didn't like being a lot slower.

1761
09:02:56,709 --> 09:02:59,709
I can't believe it was slower.

1762
09:02:59,709 --> 09:03:02,659
I can't believe he was slower.

1763
09:03:02,659 --> 09:03:04,659
I did that level like 20 times in a row.

1764
09:03:04,659 --> 09:03:07,659
And I didn't know that he was like 15% slower.

1765
09:03:07,659 --> 09:03:13,180
It took me actually like two or three solid tries.

1766
09:03:13,180 --> 09:03:19,180
You don't have to do so much darn hard work as you do when you're originally creating the character.

1767
09:03:19,180 --> 09:03:22,180
Shooting a film is necessarily very slow.

1768
09:03:22,180 --> 09:03:25,180
Wait, wait, wait. Go back. How do we go back? How do we go back? How do we pause?

1769
09:03:25,180 --> 09:03:27,180
How do we pause?

1770
09:03:27,180 --> 09:03:29,180
That was a grip.

1771
09:03:29,180 --> 09:03:31,180
Look at that grip.

1772
09:03:31,180 --> 09:03:34,180
He put his right hand over, I think, to grab the...

1773
09:03:34,180 --> 09:03:37,180
You fear to go into those mines.

1774
09:03:37,180 --> 09:03:39,180
That was a sick claw gamer grip.

1775
09:03:39,180 --> 09:03:48,479
You know what they're worth.

1776
09:03:48,479 --> 09:03:54,479
I enjoyed making the game because you don't have to do so much darn hard work as you do when you're originally creating the character.

1777
09:03:54,479 --> 09:03:59,000
Shooting a film is necessarily very slow.

1778
09:03:59,000 --> 09:04:03,000
The wonderful thing about the computer game is, of course, I don't have to get in the makeup.

1779
09:04:03,000 --> 09:04:07,009
When you do the game, you stand in the studio.

1780
09:04:07,009 --> 09:04:10,009
And you say, well, I think you ought to say this and this and this.

1781
09:04:10,009 --> 09:04:12,009
He's awesome, by the way.

1782
09:04:12,009 --> 09:04:13,009
All these wonderful lines.

1783
09:04:13,009 --> 09:04:15,310
Ambush! Ambush!

1784
09:04:15,310 --> 09:04:21,310
And then they take all that, and they incorporate it into the games, and you get some of the credit.

1785
09:04:21,310 --> 09:04:24,310
Those explosive devices must be destroyed.

1786
09:04:25,310 --> 09:04:26,310
This model of me is Gimli.

1787
09:04:26,310 --> 09:04:30,310
I'm such a vigorous, virile, attractive character.

1788
09:04:30,310 --> 09:04:32,310
He's really the only person you want to play.

1789
09:04:32,310 --> 09:04:33,310
I mean, the rest.

1790
09:04:33,310 --> 09:04:36,310
The Aragorns, the Legolas.

1791
09:04:36,310 --> 09:04:38,310
Handsome, good-looking guys and all that.

1792
09:04:38,310 --> 09:04:44,310
But for real quality warfare, you have to go for a Gimli.

1793
09:04:44,310 --> 09:04:51,740
We spent 14 months in the most beautiful locations in the world in New Zealand to get the right look for the film.

1794
09:04:51,740 --> 09:04:53,740
The game is a wartime combat situation.

1795
09:04:53,740 --> 09:04:55,740
Because you betrayed him.

1796
09:04:55,740 --> 09:04:57,740
And it's wonderfully and brilliantly-

1797
09:04:57,740 --> 09:04:58,740
I didn't betray him!

1798
09:04:58,740 --> 09:05:01,049
I can't leave him there!

1799
09:05:01,049 --> 09:05:05,049
They made it impossible to beat the ladder level with him.

1800
09:05:05,049 --> 09:05:06,049
That's not my fault.

1801
09:05:06,049 --> 09:05:09,049
It's a new addiction that I have discovered.

1802
09:05:09,049 --> 09:05:12,610
So, Gamesters, well done.

1803
09:05:12,610 --> 09:05:16,610
Congratulations on getting into this little niche that gives you the interview.

1804
09:05:16,610 --> 09:05:20,610
I wish I could tell you how to play the game better, but in fact, I could never get to this level.

1805
09:05:20,610 --> 09:05:21,610
Good luck with it.

1806
09:05:21,610 --> 09:05:22,610
Gamesters.

1807
09:05:23,610 --> 09:05:26,610
Oh, he's so wonderful.

1808
09:05:26,610 --> 09:05:32,110
I could just listen- I could listen to him talk all day.

1809
09:05:32,110 --> 09:05:36,569
He's just- he's phenomenal.

1810
09:05:36,569 --> 09:05:40,659
Do we have any more?

1811
09:05:40,659 --> 09:05:41,970
Oh, no.

1812
09:05:41,970 --> 09:05:48,860
Oh, I need level 10 with Aragorn and we get the super secret video?

1813
09:05:48,860 --> 09:05:51,740
What's down here?

1814
09:05:51,740 --> 09:05:59,419
What level- how close am I now?

1815
09:05:59,419 --> 09:06:00,849
I can't.

1816
09:06:00,849 --> 09:06:03,090
I can't replay anything.

1817
09:06:03,090 --> 09:06:06,669
I didn't get to level 10.

1818
09:06:06,669 --> 09:06:13,500
Wait, whoa, whoa, since when can I do that?

1819
09:06:13,500 --> 09:06:16,180
Since when can I do that?

1820
09:06:16,180 --> 09:06:17,180
Oh, because I beat the game.

1821
09:06:17,180 --> 09:06:18,180
Now I can do it.

1822
09:06:18,180 --> 09:06:19,180
I beat the game.

1823
09:06:19,180 --> 09:06:23,430
I see.

1824
09:06:23,430 --> 09:06:26,430
I don't want to- I don't want to see that ever again.

1825
09:06:26,430 --> 09:06:45,019
Alright, for all the shit that I was talking about the game, you do have to give some credit here.

1826
09:06:45,019 --> 09:06:47,019
This shit was 20 years ago.

1827
09:06:47,019 --> 09:06:52,279
This is pretty damn cool for 20 years to go, except for these three levels.

1828
09:06:52,279 --> 09:06:55,309
Delete them.

1829
09:06:55,309 --> 09:06:56,309
And this one.

1830
09:06:56,309 --> 09:06:59,599
And this one.

1831
09:06:59,599 --> 09:07:05,379
2001.

1832
09:07:05,379 --> 09:07:14,169
If I remember correctly, Return of the King is a much more polished, better video game.

1833
09:07:14,169 --> 09:07:20,720
I didn't like this one.

1834
09:07:20,720 --> 09:07:22,720
This one was- this one was good.

1835
09:07:22,720 --> 09:07:25,720
I didn't- okay, let's go- let me- let me reassess here.

1836
09:07:25,720 --> 09:07:27,089
Cool.

1837
09:07:27,089 --> 09:07:28,330
That was cool.

1838
09:07:28,330 --> 09:07:29,330
Fighting the ringwraiths, yeah.

1839
09:07:29,330 --> 09:07:33,339
We had to get- no, this is when they were breaking through the ice and stuff.

1840
09:07:33,339 --> 09:07:34,339
That was cool.

1841
09:07:34,339 --> 09:07:38,339
This is the big- the big troll with the- yeah, that was cool.

1842
09:07:38,339 --> 09:07:39,900
Um, eh.

1843
09:07:39,900 --> 09:07:42,260
I didn't like this one.

1844
09:07:42,260 --> 09:07:43,500
This one was good.

1845
09:07:43,500 --> 09:07:46,739
I like to walk around forests and you sneak around.

1846
09:07:46,739 --> 09:07:47,739
This one was cool.

1847
09:07:47,739 --> 09:07:49,739
No, don't like it.

1848
09:07:49,739 --> 09:07:55,300
This is not even a level.

1849
09:07:55,300 --> 09:07:57,300
This was just a door and then a boss.

1850
09:07:57,300 --> 09:07:59,300
So, I mean, it was okay.

1851
09:07:59,300 --> 09:08:00,300
Delete.

1852
09:08:00,300 --> 09:08:01,300
Good.

1853
09:08:01,300 --> 09:08:06,330
Alright, for how, like, horrendous this was.

1854
09:08:06,330 --> 09:08:09,529
It was still hysterical.

1855
09:08:09,529 --> 09:08:12,529
Like, do you remember our first four or five attempts in this level?

1856
09:08:12,529 --> 09:08:14,769
Just how much fun we were having.

1857
09:08:14,769 --> 09:08:22,589
We were having so much fun in the first five or six attempts.

1858
09:08:22,589 --> 09:08:24,589
Then an hour and a half went by.

1859
09:08:24,589 --> 09:08:33,000
Then I lost all the feeling in my tongue.

1860
09:08:33,000 --> 09:08:38,910
It's back now.

1861
09:08:38,910 --> 09:08:39,910
Twelve and a half hours.

1862
09:08:39,910 --> 09:08:47,739
Okay.

1863
09:08:47,739 --> 09:08:49,739
I want that ten- I want that level ten video.

1864
09:08:49,739 --> 09:09:01,709
Remember when he aspirated jerky?

1865
09:09:01,709 --> 09:09:03,709
Damn, it really has been a whole day.

1866
09:09:03,709 --> 09:09:13,569
How close was I to ten?

1867
09:09:13,569 --> 09:09:14,569
Okay.

1868
09:09:14,569 --> 09:09:18,190
Have I actually gone crazy?

1869
09:09:18,190 --> 09:09:19,190
YouTube.com.

1870
09:09:19,190 --> 09:09:32,099
Aragorn level ten video.

1871
09:09:32,099 --> 09:09:48,989
It doesn't exist on YouTube.

1872
09:09:48,989 --> 09:09:49,989
It doesn't exist on YouTube.

1873
09:09:49,989 --> 09:09:57,480
I want that- I want that fucking video.

1874
09:09:57,480 --> 09:10:00,480
I want to see Viggo Mortens talk about how much he loves the game again.

1875
09:10:00,480 --> 09:10:01,480
Look, this is going to be simple.

1876
09:10:01,480 --> 09:10:03,480
I'm, like, max level and shit.

1877
09:10:03,480 --> 09:10:07,449
Oh, look at how- I'm right there.

1878
09:10:07,449 --> 09:10:09,449
Oh, yeah, I'm right there.

1879
09:10:09,449 --> 09:10:10,819
Let's go.

1880
09:10:10,819 --> 09:10:20,819
What's the longest stream I've ever done?

1881
09:10:20,819 --> 09:10:25,470
What is actually the longest stream I've ever done?

1882
09:10:25,470 --> 09:10:26,900
Does anybody know?

1883
09:10:26,900 --> 09:10:29,720
It's now this one.

1884
09:10:29,720 --> 09:10:32,180
Is it actually this one now?

1885
09:10:32,180 --> 09:10:33,180
Level ten.

1886
09:10:33,180 --> 09:10:52,779
There it is.

1887
09:10:52,779 --> 09:10:55,150
We get the secret video.

1888
09:10:55,150 --> 09:11:04,540
Lifeline was pretty long.

1889
09:11:04,540 --> 09:11:06,540
I think it was, like, eleven and a half, though.

1890
09:11:06,540 --> 09:11:16,300
Come on.

1891
09:11:16,300 --> 09:11:32,910
Did I- wait, can I actually hit him?

1892
09:11:32,910 --> 09:11:35,599
Um, no.

1893
09:11:35,599 --> 09:11:47,589
Don't kill me.

1894
09:11:47,589 --> 09:11:50,540
Don't kill me.

1895
09:11:50,540 --> 09:11:56,639
He's going to be mad.

1896
09:11:56,639 --> 09:11:57,639
What do you mean mad?

1897
09:11:57,639 --> 09:12:03,569
Well, actually, I am a little bit mad.

1898
09:12:03,569 --> 09:12:05,870
Nothing to do with the video game, really.

1899
09:12:05,870 --> 09:12:13,540
It has to do with- I've been- I've been streaming on Twitch for, what, four- just five years?

1900
09:12:13,540 --> 09:12:14,540
Six years?

1901
09:12:14,540 --> 09:12:17,540
Like, just almost a full five years, right?

1902
09:12:17,540 --> 09:12:24,959
And the longest stream I've ever done is going to be for a long time.

1903
09:12:24,959 --> 09:12:27,959
Lord of the Rings The Two Towers on PlayStation 2.

1904
09:12:27,959 --> 09:12:37,900
I think that's more upsetting.

1905
09:12:37,900 --> 09:12:43,410
And the first Hobbit game.

1906
09:12:43,410 --> 09:12:45,410
Yeah, but that's not why this was so long.

1907
09:12:45,410 --> 09:12:56,860
Longest and worst stream.

1908
09:12:56,860 --> 09:12:59,040
I don't agree with that at all.

1909
09:12:59,040 --> 09:13:01,040
No, no, no, not even close.

1910
09:13:01,040 --> 09:13:03,040
I don't agree with that at all.

1911
09:13:03,040 --> 09:13:07,330
I had a fucking lot of fun on this stream.

1912
09:13:07,330 --> 09:13:10,330
I thought this was a lot of fun.

1913
09:13:11,330 --> 09:13:18,750
Yesterday's stream was the worst stream.

1914
09:13:18,750 --> 09:13:20,750
Oh, I see what you're doing.

1915
09:13:20,750 --> 09:13:22,750
Yeah, because this was streamed yesterday.

1916
09:13:22,750 --> 09:13:23,750
Oh.

1917
09:13:23,750 --> 09:13:28,910
This was- I had a lot of fun on this stream.

1918
09:13:28,910 --> 09:13:37,900
Alright.

1919
09:13:37,900 --> 09:13:38,900
Level 10.

1920
09:13:38,900 --> 09:13:39,900
Secret video.

1921
09:13:39,900 --> 09:13:40,900
Let's go.

1922
09:13:40,900 --> 09:13:59,389
The CCTV joke was worth ten hours of setup.

1923
09:13:59,389 --> 09:14:04,000
What's the final thing I'm going to buy, though?

1924
09:14:04,000 --> 09:14:05,000
Probably this thing.

1925
09:14:05,000 --> 09:14:19,870
And... this one.

1926
09:14:19,870 --> 09:14:22,260
Here we go.

1927
09:14:22,260 --> 09:14:23,440
Alright.

1928
09:14:23,440 --> 09:14:24,440
Vigo.

1929
09:14:24,440 --> 09:14:27,510
Tell me your secret-

1930
09:14:27,510 --> 09:14:29,510
Tell me your secrets, Vigo.

1931
09:14:29,510 --> 09:14:46,239
Aragorn.

1932
09:14:46,239 --> 09:14:47,239
Unplayed.

1933
09:14:47,239 --> 09:14:51,059
Let's play the video then.

1934
09:14:51,059 --> 09:14:53,809
It's about to be played.

1935
09:14:53,809 --> 09:15:19,540
What?

1936
09:15:19,540 --> 09:15:22,540
Floor 1 out of 20.

1937
09:15:22,540 --> 09:15:51,839
I'm not doing that.

1938
09:15:51,839 --> 09:15:52,839
We're not doing that.

1939
09:15:52,839 --> 09:15:53,839
I'm sorry.

1940
09:15:53,839 --> 09:15:54,839
I'm not doing- no.

1941
09:15:54,839 --> 09:15:55,839
No fucking way.

1942
09:15:55,839 --> 09:15:56,839
It's not- alright.

1943
09:15:56,839 --> 09:16:03,339
I want to watch this trending now on CNN.

1944
09:16:03,339 --> 09:16:16,080
This was probably somebody's first experience with Lord of the Rings.

1945
09:16:16,080 --> 09:16:18,080
Yeah, we talked about that earlier.

1946
09:16:18,080 --> 09:16:35,019
This was somebody's first stream.

1947
09:16:35,019 --> 09:16:37,019
Yeah, it was probably a lot of people's first streams.

1948
09:16:37,019 --> 09:16:38,260
Probably.

1949
09:16:38,260 --> 09:16:40,440
Where's the music?

1950
09:16:40,440 --> 09:16:42,739
I don't want any sounds right now.

1951
09:16:42,739 --> 09:16:44,739
I don't want any stimulation.

1952
09:16:44,739 --> 09:16:48,059
I just want to sit here.

1953
09:16:48,059 --> 09:16:52,860
No stimulation at all.

1954
09:16:52,860 --> 09:16:53,860
Except for this.

1955
09:16:53,860 --> 09:16:57,379
No stimulation.

1956
09:16:57,379 --> 09:16:58,379
Just quiet.

1957
09:16:58,379 --> 09:17:05,389
This is the only thing I want in my life right now.

1958
09:17:08,360 --> 09:17:14,919
The battle for- the battle for Home Depot.

1959
09:17:14,919 --> 09:17:21,180
Roger, people on social media are calling this the Battle of Home Depot.

1960
09:17:21,180 --> 09:17:30,180
This reporter cannot understand just how ridiculous this is, seeing this from above.

1961
09:17:30,180 --> 09:17:34,180
You don't see the other 300 people that are back behind the doors.

1962
09:17:34,180 --> 09:17:43,519
Holy shit, like, listen.

1963
09:17:43,519 --> 09:17:54,080
This is a mess.

1964
09:18:01,980 --> 09:18:03,660
Hello?

1965
09:18:03,660 --> 09:18:05,660
Wait, why is this not working?

1966
09:18:05,660 --> 09:18:06,660
There we go.

1967
09:18:06,660 --> 09:18:14,279
Is this- hello?

1968
09:18:14,279 --> 09:18:20,739
Hello?

1969
09:18:20,739 --> 09:18:21,739
Hello?

1970
09:18:21,739 --> 09:18:27,180
Yeah, guys.

1971
09:18:27,180 --> 09:18:32,900
So this is what happens.

1972
09:18:32,900 --> 09:18:41,220
This is what happens when you- yeah, it's been a long night.

1973
09:18:41,220 --> 09:18:46,580
So we're just gonna chill for a little bit.

1974
09:18:46,580 --> 09:18:49,580
You know, just hang out.

1975
09:18:49,580 --> 09:18:58,660
I might sound a little different, but that's because, you know, I've been yelling a lot tonight.

1976
09:18:58,660 --> 09:19:03,540
So I've been making a lot of noise.

1977
09:19:03,540 --> 09:19:12,260
I inhaled a piece of jerky, and that's kind of why I feel like I'm-

1978
09:19:12,260 --> 09:19:15,260
So for the bits of what- turn this off.

1979
09:19:15,260 --> 09:19:19,550
Someone was like, fuck, this is weird.

1980
09:19:19,550 --> 09:19:20,550
Todd Howard?

1981
09:19:20,550 --> 09:19:23,860
Todd Howard?

1982
09:19:23,860 --> 09:19:39,959
And next, coming up, we have our first mobile game experience.

1983
09:19:39,959 --> 09:19:40,959
I can't.

1984
09:19:40,959 --> 09:19:41,959
I have to go to bed.

1985
09:19:41,959 --> 09:19:56,129
If you thought for one second that we were not gonna go completely crazy here with Elder Scrolls Blades, that's the one.

1986
09:19:56,129 --> 09:20:10,290
Welcome to Fallout Con.

1987
09:20:10,290 --> 09:20:13,660
You can do some really weird shit with this thing, man.

1988
09:20:13,660 --> 09:20:14,660
I'll tell you.

1989
09:20:14,660 --> 09:20:15,660
Okay.

1990
09:20:15,660 --> 09:20:18,660
Like, for instance, what if I do this?

1991
09:20:18,660 --> 09:20:19,660
Ready?

1992
09:20:19,660 --> 09:20:22,220
Like, what if I go like this?

1993
09:20:22,220 --> 09:20:25,220
And then go like this, okay?

1994
09:20:25,220 --> 09:20:27,220
So right now- how does this sound now?

1995
09:20:27,220 --> 09:20:29,220
This probably sounds really weird.

1996
09:20:29,220 --> 09:20:31,220
Like, very strange.

1997
09:20:31,220 --> 09:20:32,839
Oh.

1998
09:20:32,839 --> 09:20:41,379
This is- this is, uh, this is one- this is one hour after two towers.

1999
09:20:41,379 --> 09:20:46,269
This is two hours after two towers.

2000
09:20:46,269 --> 09:20:50,370
Four hours after two towers.

2001
09:20:50,370 --> 09:20:52,370
This is six hours after two towers.

2002
09:20:52,370 --> 09:21:05,599
This is ten hours after two towers.

2003
09:21:05,599 --> 09:21:14,250
This is how I feel right now.

2004
09:21:14,250 --> 09:21:33,059
This is how I feel right now.

2005
09:21:50,660 --> 09:21:51,959
Hey.

2006
09:21:51,959 --> 09:21:52,959
Why- I sound weird now.

2007
09:21:52,959 --> 09:21:54,959
Why do I sound so strange to myself?

2008
09:21:54,959 --> 09:21:56,959
I sound weird to myself.

2009
09:21:56,959 --> 09:21:58,959
Anybody else sound weird to yourself?

2010
09:21:58,959 --> 09:21:59,959
Okay.

2011
09:21:59,959 --> 09:22:02,959
Um, I am gonna have to forego the bits tonight, guys.

2012
09:22:02,959 --> 09:22:03,959
I'm really sorry.

2013
09:22:03,959 --> 09:22:06,959
I feel like somebody just punched me in the face with a car.

2014
09:22:06,959 --> 09:22:09,959
Uh, we have like 12 hours- 13 hours of bits.

2015
09:22:09,959 --> 09:22:12,959
It's gonna take me like two or three hours to go through it.

2016
09:22:12,959 --> 09:22:17,959
Um, this is the second time we've moved bits to another day.

2017
09:22:17,959 --> 09:22:26,379
I'm really sorry about that, but, um, it's like I got- I got run over by a car.

2018
09:22:26,379 --> 09:22:29,379
It was a shitload of money and a shitload of people supported the channel.

2019
09:22:29,379 --> 09:22:31,379
You guys are fucking incredible.

2020
09:22:31,379 --> 09:22:33,379
I can at least run the credits.

2021
09:22:33,379 --> 09:22:34,940
Do them next time.

2022
09:22:34,940 --> 09:22:38,940
Yeah, by the way, this is not- I'm not streaming tomorrow.

2023
09:22:38,940 --> 09:22:40,940
This was- this was like a mega stream.

2024
09:22:40,940 --> 09:22:45,940
So what's gonna happen is you'll probably see- you'll see me again on Wednesday.

2025
09:22:45,940 --> 09:22:47,940
I'm gonna take a day or two here.

2026
09:22:47,940 --> 09:22:48,940
You'll see me on the 15th.

2027
09:22:48,940 --> 09:22:49,940
Wednesday the 15th.

2028
09:22:49,940 --> 09:22:52,750
This is an omega lol stream.

2029
09:22:52,750 --> 09:23:01,010
You ready for me to fix that once and for all?

2030
09:23:01,010 --> 09:23:05,209
Uh, it's because the- the- the heater turns on behind me.

2031
09:23:05,209 --> 09:23:08,279
I just figured it out.

2032
09:23:08,279 --> 09:23:12,849
Yep.

2033
09:23:12,849 --> 09:23:13,849
That's the heater.

2034
09:23:13,849 --> 09:23:16,849
And the gate is not high enough to mask the heater.

2035
09:23:16,849 --> 09:23:18,660
Figured it out.

2036
09:23:18,660 --> 09:23:28,760
Let me fix that right now.

2037
09:23:28,760 --> 09:23:34,930
There it is.

2038
09:23:34,930 --> 09:23:41,610
Got it.

2039
09:23:41,610 --> 09:23:44,059
That fixed it, right?

2040
09:23:44,059 --> 09:23:51,190
Okay.

2041
09:23:51,190 --> 09:23:52,190
Good.

2042
09:23:52,190 --> 09:23:53,190
Oh, wow.

2043
09:23:53,190 --> 09:23:55,190
I'm so sorry that that's been happening.

2044
09:23:55,190 --> 09:23:57,500
I'm so sorry about that.

2045
09:23:57,500 --> 09:23:59,500
I'm so s- I'm so sorry.

2046
09:23:59,500 --> 09:24:00,500
I'm so sorry.

2047
09:24:00,500 --> 09:24:01,500
Okay.

2048
09:24:01,500 --> 09:24:02,500
That sounds weird.

2049
09:24:02,500 --> 09:24:04,500
There's one more thing I want to do before I go.

2050
09:24:04,500 --> 09:24:07,930
Uh, let me look at this.

2051
09:24:07,930 --> 09:24:10,739
There's some weird shit here.

2052
09:24:10,739 --> 09:24:12,300
Hello?

2053
09:24:12,300 --> 09:24:13,300
Hold on.

2054
09:24:13,300 --> 09:24:14,300
Hello?

2055
09:24:14,300 --> 09:24:25,580
This is actually bad for Mike.

2056
09:24:25,580 --> 09:24:27,580
This is...

2057
09:24:27,580 --> 09:24:32,080
Okay.

2058
09:24:32,080 --> 09:24:35,080
There's a lot of random shit here.

2059
09:24:35,080 --> 09:24:40,099
It's me.

2060
09:24:40,099 --> 09:25:07,959
Hello?

2061
09:25:07,959 --> 09:25:12,580
This one's called- this one's called Big Ferb.

2062
09:25:12,580 --> 09:25:13,580
Big Ferb?

2063
09:25:13,580 --> 09:25:14,580
Uh...

2064
09:25:14,580 --> 09:25:17,489
Oh, Big Reverb!

2065
09:25:17,489 --> 09:25:18,489
Big Reverb!

2066
09:25:18,489 --> 09:25:19,489
Some of these are ridiculous.

2067
09:25:19,489 --> 09:25:20,489
I can be in a chapel.

2068
09:25:20,489 --> 09:25:22,690
I can be in a club.

2069
09:25:22,690 --> 09:25:23,690
This is in a music club.

2070
09:25:23,690 --> 09:25:25,250
This is a hockey arena.

2071
09:25:25,250 --> 09:25:26,250
Weird.

2072
09:25:26,250 --> 09:25:28,699
That's pretty ridiculous.

2073
09:25:28,699 --> 09:25:32,519
And you can do a lot of weird shit with this, too.

2074
09:25:32,519 --> 09:25:34,080
Okay.

2075
09:25:34,080 --> 09:25:40,309
I had my fun.

2076
09:25:40,309 --> 09:25:41,309
I will see you guys in a couple days.

2077
09:25:41,309 --> 09:25:42,309
Thank you again.

2078
09:25:42,309 --> 09:25:43,309
Here come the credits.

2079
09:25:43,309 --> 09:25:44,309
Go eat something?

2080
09:25:44,309 --> 09:25:46,449
Okay.

2081
09:25:47,879 --> 09:25:49,120
I had my fun.

2082
09:25:49,120 --> 09:25:54,059
I will see you guys in a couple days.

2083
09:25:54,059 --> 09:25:55,059
Thank you again.

2084
09:25:55,059 --> 09:25:56,059
Here come the credits.

2085
09:25:56,059 --> 09:25:57,059
Go eat something?

2086
09:25:57,059 --> 09:25:58,059
I...

2087
09:25:58,059 --> 09:25:59,059
I'm good.

2088
09:25:59,059 --> 09:26:02,480
I'll eat something.

2089
09:26:02,480 --> 09:26:06,480
Tell Joel, uh, sorry I did a 13-hour stream.

2090
09:26:06,480 --> 09:26:10,660
We'll- we'll schedule it for a few days or something.

2091
09:26:10,660 --> 09:26:16,029
Anybody even, like, streaming right now?

2092
09:26:16,029 --> 09:26:19,029
Do people stream on Twitch at, like, 4 o'clock in the morning?

2093
09:26:19,029 --> 09:26:20,029
I guess they do.

2094
09:26:20,029 --> 09:26:21,029
They ha- like, yeah, they do.

2095
09:26:21,029 --> 09:26:23,029
Who's streaming right now?

2096
09:26:23,029 --> 09:26:35,709
Uh...

2097
09:26:35,709 --> 09:26:36,709
You.

2098
09:26:36,709 --> 09:26:37,709
Oh, right.

2099
09:26:37,709 --> 09:26:39,709
Other countries exist, Jeremy.

2100
09:26:39,709 --> 09:26:41,949
Yeah, they do.

2101
09:26:41,949 --> 09:26:45,790
I'm still on the front page.

2102
09:26:45,790 --> 09:26:49,059
I'm still on the front page.

2103
09:26:49,059 --> 09:26:50,059
Okay.

2104
09:26:50,059 --> 09:26:55,639
Everybody on the front page has a...

2105
09:26:55,639 --> 09:26:57,639
Everybody on the front page has, like, a...

2106
09:26:57,639 --> 09:26:58,639
Hey, this is the person.

2107
09:26:58,639 --> 09:26:59,639
This is the streamer.

2108
09:26:59,639 --> 09:27:00,639
This is the person that you...

2109
09:27:00,639 --> 09:27:01,639
Hey, check them out.

2110
09:27:01,639 --> 09:27:02,639
This is what they do.

2111
09:27:02,639 --> 09:27:04,639
They do this, this, this, and this.

2112
09:27:04,639 --> 09:27:09,500
Mine just says, video and streamer guy.

2113
09:27:09,500 --> 09:27:12,809
Mine just says, video and streamer guy.

2114
09:27:12,809 --> 09:27:19,260
I don't know how to do anything.

2115
09:27:19,260 --> 09:27:21,260
I don't know how to run a business.

2116
09:27:21,260 --> 09:27:22,260
I need to run a business.

2117
09:27:22,260 --> 09:27:25,069
This is my business.

2118
09:27:25,069 --> 09:27:27,069
Who else has, like...

2119
09:27:27,069 --> 09:27:33,650
This is my business.

2120
09:27:33,650 --> 09:27:35,650
Germanite5 Incorporated.

2121
09:27:35,650 --> 09:27:37,720
No, I don't know.

2122
09:27:37,720 --> 09:27:38,720
Who gives a shit?

2123
09:27:38,720 --> 09:27:40,339
I don't care.

2124
09:27:40,339 --> 09:27:41,339
All right.

2125
09:27:41,339 --> 09:27:42,339
That has been fun.

2126
09:27:42,339 --> 09:27:43,339
I'll see you guys later.

2127
09:27:43,339 --> 09:27:44,709
Here come the credits.

2128
09:27:44,709 --> 09:27:47,709
Actually, we're gonna sit here and let them roll through.

2129
09:27:47,709 --> 09:27:53,339
Close to 13 hours?

2130
09:27:53,339 --> 09:27:56,180
Yeah.

2131
09:27:56,180 --> 09:27:57,180
Look at this.

2132
09:27:57,180 --> 09:27:59,180
You massacred my business.

2133
09:27:59,180 --> 09:28:01,830
What the fuck?

2134
09:28:01,830 --> 09:28:08,449
Grandma's stocks are dropping.

2135
09:28:08,449 --> 09:28:10,690
Um, that's okay.

2136
09:28:10,690 --> 09:28:12,690
It's not all about how high.

2137
09:28:12,690 --> 09:28:13,690
What the fuck is...

2138
09:28:13,690 --> 09:28:14,690
What's happening?

2139
09:28:14,690 --> 09:28:15,690
Somebody talking in my head.

2140
09:28:15,690 --> 09:28:17,180
Oh, no.

2141
09:28:17,180 --> 09:28:18,180
These are the front page streams.

2142
09:28:18,180 --> 09:28:19,180
Okay.

2143
09:28:19,180 --> 09:28:21,959
These are the front page streams.

2144
09:28:21,959 --> 09:28:25,250
Okay.

2145
09:28:25,250 --> 09:28:26,250
Gotta get off the front page.

2146
09:28:26,250 --> 09:28:30,220
What is the title of this stream?

2147
09:28:30,220 --> 09:28:36,180
Oh, I guarantee you will like the first part of Two Towers.

2148
09:28:36,180 --> 09:28:37,180
We did.

2149
09:28:37,180 --> 09:28:39,419
That last part, though.

2150
09:28:39,419 --> 09:28:40,419
We did.

2151
09:28:40,419 --> 09:28:44,180
That last part and maybe not so much.

2152
09:28:44,180 --> 09:28:46,180
But I still did.

2153
09:28:46,180 --> 09:28:49,120
I'm glad I streamed.

2154
09:28:49,120 --> 09:28:52,120
I'm glad I streamed Lord of the Rings Two Towers and beat it.

2155
09:28:52,120 --> 09:28:58,260
I hate that game.

2156
09:28:58,260 --> 09:28:59,260
Why?

2157
09:28:59,260 --> 09:29:02,489
Oh.

2158
09:29:02,489 --> 09:29:06,139
Well, this is a wild one.

2159
09:29:06,139 --> 09:29:07,139
Didn't plan on it.

2160
09:29:07,139 --> 09:29:08,139
This was gonna be just a...

2161
09:29:08,139 --> 09:29:12,269
I played Lord of the Rings Fellowship for two hours.

2162
09:29:12,269 --> 09:29:13,269
But what can I say?

2163
09:29:13,269 --> 09:29:14,269
Sometimes it happens.

2164
09:29:14,269 --> 09:29:15,269
Sometimes...

2165
09:29:15,269 --> 09:29:17,269
Sometimes this shit just happens.

2166
09:29:17,269 --> 09:29:23,739
I didn't plan hit and run either.

2167
09:29:23,739 --> 09:29:34,360
How does it feel to be a gamester?

2168
09:29:34,360 --> 09:29:35,360
Feels pretty good.

2169
09:29:35,360 --> 09:29:37,919
Feels pretty good.

2170
09:29:37,919 --> 09:29:41,989
I'm so glad I got rid of that background bullshit.

2171
09:29:41,989 --> 09:29:43,489
Hold on.

2172
09:29:43,489 --> 09:29:49,110
Let's put the compressor back on and see what it sounds like.

2173
09:29:49,110 --> 09:29:50,349
Hey.

2174
09:29:50,349 --> 09:29:51,349
Hey.

2175
09:29:51,349 --> 09:29:54,300
The compressor's back on.

2176
09:29:54,300 --> 09:29:59,300
Oh, now I know what you guys are talking about when you say this sounds fucking terrible.

2177
09:29:59,300 --> 09:30:02,919
I really thought everyone was just gaslighting me telling me that I was crazy.

2178
09:30:02,919 --> 09:30:04,919
This fucking sounds terrible.

2179
09:30:04,919 --> 09:30:06,919
This sounds awful.

2180
09:30:06,919 --> 09:30:08,919
See, now it sounds a lot better.

2181
09:30:08,919 --> 09:30:09,919
That sounds way better.

2182
09:30:09,919 --> 09:30:11,919
That sounds a thousand times better.

2183
09:30:11,919 --> 09:30:14,309
Holy shit.

2184
09:30:14,309 --> 09:30:15,309
I didn't believe you.

2185
09:30:15,309 --> 09:30:16,309
I really didn't.

2186
09:30:16,309 --> 09:30:19,309
I didn't believe a single word anybody was saying.

2187
09:30:19,309 --> 09:30:25,819
Because this is what it sounded like before.

2188
09:30:25,819 --> 09:30:28,949
Maybe I need to be closer to the mic.

2189
09:30:28,949 --> 09:30:31,379
It's just my room is so noisy.

2190
09:30:31,379 --> 09:30:32,379
That's the problem.

2191
09:30:32,379 --> 09:30:34,139
Oh, hey guys.

2192
09:30:34,139 --> 09:30:40,690
It's the podcast voice.

2193
09:30:40,690 --> 09:30:42,690
Good afternoon.

2194
09:30:42,690 --> 09:30:49,750
Hope everybody's having a great day today.

2195
09:30:49,750 --> 09:30:52,750
The following has encouragement.

2196
09:30:52,750 --> 09:30:53,750
That's what it is.

2197
09:30:53,750 --> 09:30:54,750
It's a bunch of compressed.

2198
09:30:54,750 --> 09:31:02,709
The following has encouragement and love.

2199
09:31:02,709 --> 09:31:05,709
We want to thank you for being here.

2200
09:31:05,709 --> 09:31:14,860
You're the one that gets things done around here.

2201
09:31:14,860 --> 09:31:16,860
Well, tell him.

2202
09:31:16,860 --> 09:31:20,940
A great job.

2203
09:31:20,940 --> 09:31:22,940
You're the one that gets things done around.

2204
09:31:22,940 --> 09:31:23,940
That's what he did.

2205
09:31:23,940 --> 09:31:24,940
Holy shit.

2206
09:31:24,940 --> 09:31:25,940
I love that guy.

2207
09:31:25,940 --> 09:31:26,940
Okay.

2208
09:31:26,940 --> 09:31:27,940
Let's go back to normal.

2209
09:31:27,940 --> 09:31:28,940
Hold on.

2210
09:31:28,940 --> 09:31:29,940
What if I do this?

2211
09:31:29,940 --> 09:31:30,940
Well, I think I fixed it.

2212
09:31:30,940 --> 09:31:31,940
Did I fix it even more?

2213
09:31:31,940 --> 09:31:32,940
I think I just fixed it even more.

2214
09:31:32,940 --> 09:31:35,500
I think I just fixed it even more.

2215
09:31:35,500 --> 09:31:36,500
Did I?

2216
09:31:36,500 --> 09:31:37,500
Hey.

2217
09:31:37,500 --> 09:31:38,500
How you guys doing?

2218
09:31:38,500 --> 09:31:39,500
Is it fixed?

2219
09:31:39,500 --> 09:31:40,500
Fixed even more?

2220
09:31:40,500 --> 09:31:41,500
Are we fixed even more?

2221
09:31:41,500 --> 09:31:42,500
How are we?

2222
09:31:42,500 --> 09:31:43,500
No, it's worse now.

2223
09:31:43,500 --> 09:31:44,500
How about now?

2224
09:31:44,500 --> 09:31:45,500
How about this?

2225
09:31:45,500 --> 09:31:48,800
Is it a little bit better from here?

2226
09:31:48,800 --> 09:31:54,419
Sounds exactly the same.

2227
09:31:54,419 --> 09:31:55,419
Now it sounds horrible.

2228
09:31:55,419 --> 09:32:03,400
What if I do this?

2229
09:32:03,400 --> 09:32:04,400
Okay.

2230
09:32:04,400 --> 09:32:05,400
I just did this.

2231
09:32:05,400 --> 09:32:07,019
All right.

2232
09:32:07,019 --> 09:32:08,019
Maybe now...

2233
09:32:08,019 --> 09:32:09,019
How's that?

2234
09:32:09,019 --> 09:32:11,019
Is that a little bit better?

2235
09:32:11,019 --> 09:32:16,360
Does this change anything?

2236
09:32:16,360 --> 09:32:18,360
Does it make it sound better?

2237
09:32:18,360 --> 09:32:20,500
Or no?

2238
09:32:20,500 --> 09:32:21,500
Still just as bad?

2239
09:32:21,500 --> 09:32:22,500
Go back?

2240
09:32:22,500 --> 09:32:24,059
Okay.

2241
09:32:24,059 --> 09:32:27,059
I'm still trying to get it to sound okay, you know?

2242
09:32:27,059 --> 09:32:30,540
Go back to podcast voice.

2243
09:32:30,540 --> 09:32:32,540
I really don't think you want me to go back to podcast voice.

2244
09:32:32,540 --> 09:32:36,849
Hold on.

2245
09:32:36,849 --> 09:32:37,849
What about this?

2246
09:32:37,849 --> 09:32:38,849
Okay.

2247
09:32:38,849 --> 09:32:41,849
Listen to how weird this sounds.

2248
09:32:41,849 --> 09:32:45,849
So this is 100 compressor and 100 de-esser.

2249
09:32:45,849 --> 09:32:48,599
This is like...

2250
09:32:48,599 --> 09:32:49,599
It just sounds so strange.

2251
09:32:49,599 --> 09:32:51,599
Don't I sound so weird?

2252
09:32:51,599 --> 09:32:56,699
I sound like a different person.

2253
09:32:56,699 --> 09:32:57,699
All right.

2254
09:32:57,699 --> 09:33:02,989
Anyways, guys, I'll see you in a couple days.

2255
09:33:02,989 --> 09:33:03,989
See you in...

2256
09:33:03,989 --> 09:33:06,699
On Wednesday.

2257
09:33:06,699 --> 09:33:07,699
See you soon.

2258
09:33:07,699 --> 09:33:13,139
I'm going to wait until it's 13 hours though.

2259
09:33:13,139 --> 09:33:14,139
Because...

2260
09:33:14,139 --> 09:33:15,139
Come on.

2261
09:33:15,139 --> 09:33:29,309
I got to take my victories where I can.

2262
09:33:29,309 --> 09:33:31,309
We want to thank you.

2263
09:33:31,309 --> 09:33:35,680
I just normally sound like that guy, I think.

2264
09:33:35,680 --> 09:33:40,709
I think I just actually sound like that, dude.

2265
09:33:40,709 --> 09:33:43,339
Somebody with a raid?

2266
09:33:43,339 --> 09:33:47,580
I mean, nobody I follow is even streaming right now.

2267
09:33:47,580 --> 09:33:55,699
It's so late.

2268
09:33:55,699 --> 09:33:56,699
Who cares?

2269
09:33:56,699 --> 09:33:57,699
It's got to be somebody that you follow.

2270
09:33:57,699 --> 09:34:03,379
It's got to be somebody that you follow.

2271
09:34:03,379 --> 09:34:04,379
Let's see.

2272
09:34:04,379 --> 09:34:05,379
Let's see.

2273
09:34:05,379 --> 09:34:06,379
Do you want to just pick somebody?

2274
09:34:06,379 --> 09:34:07,379
We could.

2275
09:34:07,379 --> 09:34:14,180
We should just see.

2276
09:34:14,180 --> 09:34:15,360
All right.

2277
09:34:15,360 --> 09:34:16,660
Who the fuck is streaming?

2278
09:34:16,660 --> 09:34:36,139
Um, um, um, um.

2279
09:34:36,139 --> 09:34:38,139
Raid somebody with zero viewers?

2280
09:34:38,139 --> 09:34:40,139
No, I don't.

2281
09:34:40,139 --> 09:34:42,139
That's a lot of pressure.

2282
09:34:42,139 --> 09:34:47,559
Some people really don't want that, I don't think.

2283
09:34:47,559 --> 09:34:50,989
I mean, you know what I mean?

2284
09:34:50,989 --> 09:34:57,699
We could, but that's a lot of people to dump on somebody.

2285
09:34:57,699 --> 09:34:59,699
I don't like putting that kind of pressure on somebody.

2286
09:34:59,699 --> 09:35:16,620
Um.

2287
09:35:16,620 --> 09:35:18,620
Raid my friend.

2288
09:35:18,620 --> 09:35:21,620
Raid my friend.

2289
09:35:21,620 --> 09:35:27,129
Dude, can you raid my friend?

2290
09:35:27,129 --> 09:35:29,129
He's live right now.

2291
09:35:29,129 --> 09:35:35,269
Go raid him.

2292
09:35:35,269 --> 09:35:41,779
I'm just scrolling down looking.

2293
09:35:41,779 --> 09:35:53,019
Find someone streaming a Lord of the Rings game?

2294
09:35:53,019 --> 09:35:56,500
Impossible.

2295
09:35:56,500 --> 09:36:04,300
I don't think that's possible.

2296
09:36:04,300 --> 09:36:13,290
Hold on.

2297
09:36:13,290 --> 09:36:15,489
Hold on.

2298
09:36:15,489 --> 09:36:16,489
Hold on.

2299
09:36:16,489 --> 09:36:17,489
All right.

2300
09:36:17,489 --> 09:36:18,489
Let's pick a game.

2301
09:36:18,489 --> 09:36:19,489
We'll pick a game first.

2302
09:36:19,489 --> 09:36:27,470
From there.

2303
09:36:27,470 --> 09:36:28,470
Raid the guy's friend.

2304
09:36:28,470 --> 09:36:47,059
You please raid.

2305
09:36:47,059 --> 09:36:48,059
Hold on.

2306
09:36:48,059 --> 09:36:49,059
What's your friend's channel?

2307
09:36:49,059 --> 09:36:52,059
Let me look at this person.

2308
09:36:52,059 --> 09:36:54,550
Either that or we're just.

2309
09:36:54,550 --> 09:37:04,540
Is that right?

2310
09:37:04,540 --> 09:37:11,330
My friend's channel.

2311
09:37:11,330 --> 09:37:12,949
Everyone keeps saying cry.

2312
09:37:12,949 --> 09:37:14,949
Cry, cry, cry.

2313
09:37:14,949 --> 09:37:15,949
Cry.

2314
09:37:15,949 --> 09:37:18,220
What do you mean?

2315
09:37:18,220 --> 09:37:25,870
I'm cry?

2316
09:37:25,870 --> 09:37:26,870
Oh, cryotic.

2317
09:37:26,870 --> 09:37:29,879
Oh, okay.

2318
09:37:29,879 --> 09:37:36,019
Where's, um, playing Noito?

2319
09:37:36,019 --> 09:37:40,819
He just went offline.

2320
09:37:40,819 --> 09:37:41,819
Swivel.

2321
09:37:41,819 --> 09:37:43,819
Thanks Swivel for the 10 subs.

2322
09:37:43,819 --> 09:37:45,819
Did he just go offline?

2323
09:37:45,819 --> 09:37:46,819
Just finished.

2324
09:37:46,819 --> 09:37:47,819
Oh, okay.

2325
09:37:47,819 --> 09:37:53,739
Thank you for the 10 fucking subs.

2326
09:37:53,739 --> 09:37:55,739
Let's just go to bed.

2327
09:37:55,739 --> 09:38:00,599
Oh, you know who we, you know, all right.

2328
09:38:00,599 --> 09:38:04,250
You know who we could raid?

2329
09:38:04,250 --> 09:38:10,470
We could raid Immortal HD.

2330
09:38:10,470 --> 09:38:20,410
I've hung out with Immortal a few times in real life actually.

2331
09:38:20,410 --> 09:38:23,779
At random events and stuff.

2332
09:38:23,779 --> 09:38:26,099
Let's do that.

2333
09:38:26,099 --> 09:38:30,330
Let's go raid Immortal HD.

2334
09:38:35,660 --> 09:38:41,250
You know, I've like hung out with them at events and stuff, you know.

2335
09:38:41,250 --> 09:38:42,250
No big deal.

2336
09:38:42,250 --> 09:38:43,250
I know him.

2337
09:38:43,250 --> 09:38:45,250
I know this guy.

2338
09:38:45,250 --> 09:38:47,250
Don't worry about it.

2339
09:38:47,250 --> 09:38:49,000
All right.

2340
09:38:49,000 --> 09:38:50,000
I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

2341
09:38:50,000 --> 09:38:54,379
Have a great rest of your night.

2342
09:38:54,379 --> 09:38:58,379
Thanks for sticking around for 13 hours, 3 minutes and 33 seconds.

2343
09:38:58,379 --> 09:38:59,550
Take care guys.

2344
09:38:59,550 --> 09:39:00,550
Thanks for sticking around.

2345
09:39:00,550 --> 09:39:01,550
We'll do the bits on Wednesday.

2346
09:39:01,550 --> 09:39:02,550
I promise.

2347
09:39:02,550 --> 09:39:03,860
Good night guys.
