1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,350
The local vector with target vessel is locked. Operate light screen. Hang and depressurized. Move out to the arming area and careful you don't bang up my flight deck.

2
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:29,100
Right, let's go down the checklist here and make sure you didn't knock any screws loose on a trip over.

3
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,909
The old gun head here has got four weapon hardpoints and four item brackets.

4
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:41,179
First up, rattle off a few rounds from the machine gun into the targets.

5
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,590
Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with Crypt Dark.

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,590
Yes, that was me. I was giving myself a tutorial.

7
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,590
If you haven't played the game yet, or if you've played it, or if you've been watching the streams I've been doing recently.

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:07,590
I did voice work for this game. I am the tutorial-esque character. I pop up time to time in the game and give the player certain hints and tips and various other details on the game.

9
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,590
And it's in early access right now. It just came out last week.

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:19,150
And it's actually pretty damn fun. I usually don't like to do early access games. I cover them on my channel or talk about them at all or play them.

11
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,390
Because a lot of times they're never done. And they're either stuck in like tech demo hell for a long time.

12
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,390
Or they're a certain genre that I just really don't care about.

13
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,629
But this one in particular, this is by the Apotheon guys, Alien Trap.

14
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
And it's pretty far along in development. It's close.

15
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,870
I think they only want the game in early access for 6-12 months or something.

16
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,870
A pretty short turnaround. The game is a start to finish experience at this point.

17
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,870
You can actually complete the game.

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,049
And we'll talk about the game very briefly. It's a roguelike twin stick space shooter.

19
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,049
Like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne had a baby and went to space.

20
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,420
The whole goal is you go through these places. They're like essentially dungeons that you have to clear.

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,420
There's a core that you blow up. And once the core is destroyed, you move on.

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,419
You have to do that seven times.

23
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,419
The seventh one is the Cryptarch.

24
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,419
And it's an extremely difficult version of all the types of random stuff that you can see in this game.

25
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,719
I've not beaten it yet. I've not gotten to the Cryptarch in actually one.

26
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,719
I've gotten to it a couple of times.

27
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,719
But each one of those times I end up running out of money and lose the game.

28
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,719
Because when you die, when your ship explodes, the game isn't over.

29
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,719
You don't go to the very beginning again.

30
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,719
It's a roguelike in the sense that you have to spend money for your loadouts.

31
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,719
So when you run out of money, you don't have any more cash to spend on your loadouts is when the game ends.

32
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,020
There's a shitload of weapons and items you can find throughout the game and unlock and equip.

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
That's one of my favorite parts about the whole game.

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
You have four slots for weapons and you can do wacky shit like this.

35
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
These are four zip guns.

36
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,479
Now there's no conceivable reason why you'd ever do this.

37
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,479
But you can. You can do it however you want.

38
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,479
You can put any amount of items and weapons on.

39
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,479
As long as you have the money to support it, you can do it.

40
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:09,909
That's really all I got to say.

41
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:11,909
I just wanted to give a quick little shout out to the game.

42
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,909
And I'll leave you with a couple more lines that I say throughout the game.

43
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,150
And yeah, it's on Steam. Check it out if you want.

44
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,389
It's Crypt Dark. 13 bucks. It's a good one.

45
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,699
I would suggest trying it out. It's a good one.

46
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,129
Check it out on Steam.

47
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,129
The game's out on Steam right now. Check it out on Steam.

48
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:48,120
Checklist cleared. I'll get the angle quite soon.
