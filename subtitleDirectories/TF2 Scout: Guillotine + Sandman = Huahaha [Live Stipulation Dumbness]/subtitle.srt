00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,080
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smeep Smoop Smoop.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,519
Today, gonna be not killing that spy because it's a real person.

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:23,989
Playing as the scout with the cleaver and the ball. The big balls.

4
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,949
Uh, what am I doing here? I'm just gonna go for kills with this.

5
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:34,810
And if I get him, I get him, you know? Hey, what's up dude? Oh, damn it. Give me that ball.

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,609
You prick. I would have had that too.

7
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:47,049
There it is. Get out of town. Get out of town. I'm running circles around you.

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,219
All right. This guy's dumb too. Ready? I'll get this.

9
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:56,630
No shit. No, don't let him cap it. Get him.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:03,689
What? That was bad. That was real bad. At least I got that guy. That's one.

11
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,939
If I don't, I've got to get at least five of those in this video.

12
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,019
I don't care if it takes me like two hours.

13
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:22,519
Look buddy. I mean, I don't ask me what the hell this guy's doing.

14
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,180
Get it. Bang. Nice. That's two. That makes two.

15
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,340
Got to do this at least a few more times until I am satisfied.

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,250
I have an insatiable hunger to throw this into people's faces.

17
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:47,079
It is my thirst. It's just not... Will you quit jumping around like a freaking jackrabbit?

18
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,879
All right. You know what? I'm just going to start shooting you now.

19
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,879
I know I'm breaking the stipulation rules, but I have to kill this guy.

20
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:06,780
He is just... Is every single soldier on Hightower a rocket jumping soldier?

21
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,150
That is an inquiry. I want to be answered.

22
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:17,719
I feel like every single soldier that's on this map at all times is using the rocket jumper.

23
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,860
Like, look it. Even on our team. And this guy's going to burn to death.

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,080
See you. Nice. Look at... You see the guy just...

25
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,879
That guy just rocket jumped over his dead body.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,310
Stop rocket jumping!

27
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,909
I'm just not going to do it again. I'm just not going to do it against a soldier anymore.

28
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,870
There's just no reason to. He's just going to rocket jump, but I'm going to miss him.

29
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,819
Look, look. Ready? Oh, I would have missed him. Don't worry.

30
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:57,400
My goodness. That headshot was unbelievable.

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,500
You get it. You'll get it. Okay. I will give you that one.

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,860
Everybody gets one. Now you're dead. You're not even there anymore.

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,259
But yeah, now when you come... Here we go. Here we go. I'll get him.

34
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:17,539
Here we go. Here it is. Sir... He was just...

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,990
Don't worry. I'll still get him. No, he's going to headshot me.

36
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,750
I'm going to get right up close to him.

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,180
I'm going to try to taunt kill this guy. Actually, you know, you know what?

38
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:38,620
There it is! Just screw you! You took... I had that.

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,969
I seriously had that. And you took it all away from me.

40
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:50,340
And don't mind me. I just want to go up here and taunt kill this sniper.

41
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
God damn you. Or I'll do this.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,300
Either or. Either or. Neither nor.

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,710
Give me the health. Give me the health. Give me the health.

44
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,479
What the... What am I doing? Why did I just do that?

45
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,340
Oh, I'm going to predict your movements because I'm smart.

46
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:21,939
That was the dumbest thing I've ever done. Hey, see you later. Home run.

47
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,699
No! No, you fuck. No, I can't believe it.

48
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,730
I can't believe it. You...

49
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:54,540
Of course that'll happen. And it didn't kill him, but yes, it did.

50
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,069
Oh, Lord. All right. I got it. That makes four.

51
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,699
That makes four. I just got to get one more.

52
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,180
And I am the victor of this challenge.

53
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,870
Just... I want to do that. I want to do that.

54
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,629
Hey, look. It's just a scout at the door.

55
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,459
That's the noise it has to make.

56
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,019
You know, I'm going to be patient here. I'm going to fall off this.

57
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,579
Let me be patient. I think I've been spotted.

58
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,180
In fact, I'm almost certain I've been spotted by that soldier that's down there. Maybe not.

59
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,279
Okay. You may in fact be... I don't know.

60
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm too afraid to go check.

61
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,829
I love how we both have the same idea.

62
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:48,279
Dude, there's been like three snipers up in this roost like the whole game.

63
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,800
You tell... Okay. Here we go.

64
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,990
He doesn't see me. I wonder how long it's going to take.

65
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,899
Don't mind me. I'm just part of the set.

66
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,699
I'm set piece scout. That's like what my name is now.

67
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,009
Don't let him do it. That's five. That's five.

68
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,110
I can't believe I just died from that.

69
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,089
What is that? What dog is that? What cartoon dog did I just do?

70
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,250
Come on. Come on. Comment section.

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,410
I need your help.

72
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,129
Here we go. I'm going to get one more for good measure.

73
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,899
One more for good measure. One more for good measure.

74
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,939
Here we go, baby. Nope.

75
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,540
Nope. Nope.

76
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Nope. Nope.

77
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,050
Nope. No.

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,639
No, don't kill me.

79
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:05,930
What's going on with my neck? Did you see that?

80
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:11,420
My guy was his head was going like, what the... What was that?

81
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,269
Outrageous.

82
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:22,420
All right. This is the last life. This is the last life, I think.

83
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,319
Give it to me. God damn it.

84
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,759
I'm going to keep you in the co...

85
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh, see, big mistake number one was you doing that.

86
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,980
Yeah. All right. The deed is done.

87
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,350
Now it's time.

88
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,240
No, dude. Come on. Mr. Pyro.

89
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,199
Holy shit.

90
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,819
I've said this before and I'll say it again.

91
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,120
When a bald ass Pyro is looking at you, he's a spy.

92
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,079
He just is. That's just the way there is.

93
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,759
I can't believe I didn't see through that.

94
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,480
I thought it was... Whatever.

95
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,339
Let's wrap this up. Let's wrap this up right now, please.

96
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,500
Well, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

97
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,540
I think I got like five kills, six kills with this thing.

98
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,309
No, let me get the fucking taunt kill.
