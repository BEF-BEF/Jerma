00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,220
Hey, what's up everybody? What's happening? Welcome to the stream. It's me, Jerma. Nice to see you guys.

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,500
How was your day today? How were you doing?

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,550
Today we're gonna be playing the L.A. Noire game that we played last night. We're gonna just keep going.

4
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,050
And...

5
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,100
Okay, sorry about that for a second there. Just had something in my throat.

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,590
How is everybody doing today? Are you guys ready to play some games?

7
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,420
Okay.

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,380
Okay.

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:06,379
Frame drop. Oh, yeah.

10
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:14,810
That happened to us last time too, though.

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,290
Sometimes it takes a second for us to get really going.

12
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,909
Already dropping frames. Loving the stream, buddy.

13
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,489
Come on, man.

14
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,489
Come on.

15
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,099
I dropped a hundred frames

16
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,430
in the first two minutes.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,349
It has been like

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:44,230
40 hours of streams the last like five days and we've been pretty green.

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,269
So look, it's gonna it's gonna hiccup every now and again.

20
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:57,500
I mean like, come on, man. My title's got a typo.

21
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,609
Uh, oh, yeah, it does.

22
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,090
Nice. Hey, good pickup.

23
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,099
Well, anyways, hi guys.

24
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,099
Uh, we're gonna play L.A. Noire again.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,819
Because that's just kind of what I that's what what we're doing.

26
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,500
We've got a lot of these games that I started and got halfway through.

27
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,379
I'd like to at least attempt to try to finish them.

28
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,500
How could I be a substitute teacher if I can't spell unknown?

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Well, here's the thing. It's called, um,

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
pressing the keys too fast

31
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,419
and

32
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,580
not pressing down hard enough on the end.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,819
Then you graze by it and you keep going. That's where 90% of my problems come from when I'm using the computer.

34
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,580
Is just grazing keys and not pressing down hard enough.

35
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,349
Making excuses to seem smart.

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,099
That mean do I need excuses?

37
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Graduated at the bottom of my class.

38
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,039
Barely scraped by high school.

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,939
Um, got like a 2.7 GPA in college.

40
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,409
And, uh,

41
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,810
got a degree in communication.

42
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,949
Got a gamer degree in, uh,

I think I think I did okay, you know?

45
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,199
I got the boomer degree.

46
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,699
How does communication work?

47
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,699
Communication is film, tv, and radio.

48
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,610
It's you know, like it's mass media is what it is.

49
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,500
Fake gamer certificate.

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,939
You're lucky

51
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,259
that I don't permanently instant ban you.

52
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,689
Boomer jokes were never funny. I'm not making them. I'm just responding to them.

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,329
Should I stop responding to the boomer jokes?

54
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,579
Should I do that?

55
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,579
Let's get that smooth jasmine, but yes.

56
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,180
All the negative comments. I don't read just negative comments.

57
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,139
I read nice ones too.

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,740
Like for instance, uh, smelly boy says found the boomer.

59
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,180
Um, another one, uh,

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,439
uh, senpai says change outfit you dirty man.

61
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,379
I,

62
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,629
I can't read them.

63
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,519
I can't,

64
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,680
king crawfil says idiot streamer.

65
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,860

66
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,110

All right, let's go.

70
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,410
I'm gonna pick up right where we left off last night.

71
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,529

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,410
We're gonna do spring tomorrow as well

74
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,220
and judging by how far we get here, we're gonna go tomorrow too.

75
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,740
So my plan is to go tomorrow and I'm gonna take Sunday and Monday off

76
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,220
because I really need to prepare for the green screen screen stream because listen ladies and gentlemen boys and girls

77
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
We've got a solid date here now.

78
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,050
Thursday the 15th

79
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,769
Is the green screen stream locked in with the studio

80
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,220

81
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,579

There's like 15 to 20 options. You're gonna have to narrow it down to like three

86
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,490
So there'll be a poll tomorrow. I will give it to you

87
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,129
Before the stream during the stream and after the stream as well

88
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,199
And before he streams a blank green background for four hours. Oh, but so much work has gone into this

89
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,199
That would be the dumbest thing i've ever done

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Timber, please turn the game volume down. My wife can't hear it

91
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,819
Can the game volume down?

92

93
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,910

We did see this last night, but might as well just get another view

99
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,879
It's such a bad game

100
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,509
More like 25 streams of fun

Whole of your hot counselor now is not the time to lose your narrow

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,620
What is he talking about? Well, if you were here last night at the very end of the stream

141
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
We talked about something not bad

142
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Does this mark mean anything?

143
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:59,929
Almost gives you an idea of the quality

144
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,190
Okay

145
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,580
Hello

146
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
What have you got on the guy who brought these in?

147
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,340
It goes by the name of percy b shelley gave an address

148
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,940
15 poland street london that's far away

149
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,860
Can you give us a description of the man who pawned these rings? Not sure

150
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:18,659
Medium height what if he was like ugly?

151
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,860
Really ugly I think ugliest guy i've ever seen

152
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,870
He just had one of those forgettable faces. We'll be in touch. Mr. Bremner

153
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:36,330
Okay, I like this desk

154
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,970
Then now this is the kind of desk that I wish that that I had

155
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,350
On the right you gotta you gotta draw to put your stuff

156
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,830
Enough place for three monitors computer can go under here and then a big storage thing. I wish they sold this

157
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,139
I'm, not a big fan of the finish. I would I would actually prefer um a walnut finish

158
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,539
That desk I have is nice

159
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,049
But it's lacking storage

160
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,659
You've got to admit this is looking hot

161
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,340
And he went to pawn a ring

162
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:16,070
But if you take it along with all of the other indicators real yard hugo moeller was identified by the school's ground keeper

163
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:21,990
He's our guy witnesses have fingered the wrong guy before he ran for god's sake. What's my game of the year so far?

164
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,269
He always maintained he was uh red dead redemption 2 made it unfair

165
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,070
We have a problem

166
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,269
We could have the local so i'm not gonna you know i'm not gonna include red dead redemption 2 in my list

167
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,909
purpose of games of the year

168
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,230
Because that's just cheating it's not fair

169
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,629
That's like an s tier it's that that always is number one and then we have to find out like what the other ones

170
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:50,809
Underneath it are all your letters are genuine and the man who may have also killed dear drew moeller

171
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,090
And how do we prove that like if you do a top five?

172
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,129
In like the golden locked slot up above the top five is red dead redemption 2

173
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,169
So

174
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:18,360
Red redemption 2 is zero

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,519
What have you played it?

176
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,019
It's very fun

177
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,019
I still have to play god of war. That's

178
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,740
People are talking about how great that was

179
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,019
Spider-man was really good house flipper

180
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,269
And I try really do mean that completely not joking like i'm not kidding when I say that

181
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:50,539
Yeah, those of you that think that's a joke. I mean it sounds like a joke, but it's not

182
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Zero is below one

183
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,980
Well, yeah zero, yeah

184
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
One zero would not be above one

185
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:10,250
A way out a way out was a really interesting game that had a really interesting cool finish

186
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,970
But the whole game of a way out was a little

187
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:18,889
It was a little I don't know the climax of a way out was amazing

188
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,419
I don't know

189
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:36,470
What else came out this year?

190
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,990
This is so much further away than the objective, but by the way, this is like this

191
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,070
I don't even want to do this anymore. It's too far away

192
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:51,289
What was better detroit become human or a way out?

193
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,470
uh

194
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,639
uh, I don't know

195
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,730
I mean probably a way out because

196
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,809
a way out was

197
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,649
Something very different

198
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,980
It gets an extra notch

199
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,179
on the belt

200
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,100
for being

201
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:33,529
All different if detroit become human got rid of the other two storylines and it was just

202
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,159
Connor and hank go on admissions together and it's like a buddy cop game

203
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,720
I would probably think it was

204
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,799
Way better than it was

205
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,100
Don't shoot him. Oh, wow. He shot him. Why did he start running this way?

206
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,220
What

207
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,420
This isn't like a football game, man. You don't have to like

208
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,029
Oh boy. Sorry

209
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,099
All right. Don't kill this guy. I need to apprehend him

210
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,579
Killing this guy is not I I need to apprehend the suspect

211
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
No more code fours

212
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:34,470
I almost shot that guy right there because he had the same clothes on

213
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,980
Why is this guy so much faster?

214
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Okay, here we go

215
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:50,410
Wait, he's not getting in a car. He's in he's he's in the car. Which car is he in?

216
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,819
It's a stitch up with her lovely tune

217
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:22,859
I thought he was trying okay

218
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,539
I thought if he followed him for long enough

219
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,740
He was gonna got in the car and was gonna leave and then I saw the gunshots and I

220
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,500
Didn't know which car he was behind and then it was too late by the time he got behind the car

221
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,920
Like you the death sentence was already there. So

222
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,559
He was there for a solid fight. I doesn't I I i'm sorry

223
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,799
But he got behind the car and I was already backing up and I didn't feel like getting out to like pursue him in

224
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,359
Or he probably would have shot me and then I would have seen the lul in the chat a hundred times

225
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,440
You know, I would have got out like how do I arrest him? What's the arrest button? What's the arrest button?

226
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,759
And then he was chopping the head and it would have been like lul like failed fish like idiot guys stump stupid idiot

227
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,400
126 iq I would have seen I've looked over and would have saw it

228
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,559
So I took it into my own hands and he got in the way. So it's just I'll finish

229
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,569
He still saw lul a hundred times

230
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,529
But that was not like and that was not me intentionally trying to receive lul because there's plenty of moments where like you can tell

231
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:47,609
I'm intentionally trying to get some lul's out of the out of you guys

232
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:56,119
I would say it's like I'd say it's like like 30 percent is intentional lul moments and the other 70 percent

233
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,599
Is unintentional lul moments

234
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,940
And that was one of those

235
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:20,710
God damn it. We survived this

236
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:26,470
It's going to be another thing to just to briefly bring up it and me saying lul and you guys, you know kind of

237
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,809
be

238
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,430
Inceptioning that into your head

239
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,509
As I got back with the analytics and the data behind it and I send certain companies that contact me

240
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:38,470
Well, how how how funny is your stream? Well, you know, if you take a look at the amount of lul's that happened last night

241
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,869
Uh a lot here forty two forty three hundred lul's

242
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,670
Uh, I can i'm here for you company b company a

243
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,859
Like i'm just i'm gaming analytics right now, you know what i'm saying?

244
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,859
So if any company's ever looking for like a really really really funny guy

245
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:10,440
I mean i'm i've got to be number one. You're crazy. I'm crazy. It's your fault. Okay guy with the gun behind my back

246
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
How am I supposed to trust you? God damn it

247
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:21,769
Don't shoot her everybody just shoots the person see sir. I think you ought to calm down. Here's kenny mind your own

248
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,809
God damn business. Why is everybody always on my case?

249
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:32,150
Told you here comes the sprint run away

250
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,779
Watch it

00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:44,099
Give it up old man

252
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,559

I got it. Okay. Did did I kill him?

256
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:16,309
Come on code two code two car 11k

257
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:21,750
Code four at alvera street, but i'll need an ambulance shots fired. The suspect is down

258
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:33,539
Solve that big case

259
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,599
Lul moments

260
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:50,359
Like isn't twitch will keep their own metrics and eventually when twitch implements like top lol lul moment of the week

261
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,180
I'll be in that compilation and they're like they'll have the chat on the side

262
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,710
Funny man crazy man german on a5 one of our resident top 1000 twitch partners

263
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Did something outrageous

264
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,269
Chasing down an old man in a parking lot

265
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,960
He actually ran him over with the car. It'd be like bob bob saget. What do you mean when he used to do the voiceovers?

266
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
on home videos

267
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,779
Somebody that's what you'll start doing voiceovers and like oh my hey, it's me

268
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm the old man wink wink add like fucking barking sounds and the funny like baby noises and stuff

269
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,369
I'll be on that compilation because i'll be able to look at the chat and see how many lul's were there

270
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,609
I'll be in the top lul moments of the week

271
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,819
Those of you that don't understand that reference

272
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:52,140
It's pretty specific and it's pretty old too kids in chat never saw

273
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,380
american

274
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,299
Another one of these

275
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,500
Too young

276
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,980
Hey, I remember i'm old enough to remember when it wasn't abbreviated to afv. It was america's funniest home videos

277
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,109
not america's funniest videos

278
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,519
And bob saget was the host and every single clip he did the same baby voice

279
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,049
And added comedic effect to every single clip and somebody won at the end

280
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:27,859
I think i'm would it be funny to do that do like a top clips

281
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,119
from twitch

282
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,200
And they're already there, but I just voice over them like bob saget used to do

283
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,099
Oh, yeah, wait that already that did already happen

284
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah, but like ray william johnson didn't do funny baby voices over all the footage

285
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,920
Did he?

286
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Jesus felps

287
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,279
He did

288
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:15,579
I don't remember him doing that

289
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:22,940
He pitch shifted his voice up

290
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,039
Oh, yeah, he did do that

291
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:36,380
Forgot. Yeah, he did like pitch shift his voice happened say things. He did do the bob saget. Holy shit

292
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:50,650
All right, here we go. This would be the third street crime in a row

293
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,859
You leave no witnesses you stay out of the park

294
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,299
I'm not riding all the way to santa ana and then on the cincinnati with you pissing in my ear

295
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:04,259
I don't think anyone wants to pee in their ear. I don't have a choice

296
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,460
Stick-up charge is still a stick-up charge and I ain't going back inside

297
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,789
You got stuck that place up with me you're in trouble anything stupid

298
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,119
All right. This one is this one won't be a code for because it's no i'm not shooting anybody

299
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,119
This one is just pursued

300
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,009
Oops

301
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:36,970
Oh, this is tight tight tight corners here

302
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,670
You gotta get me closer

303
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:59,450
I think i'm like a little buggy

304
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,089
Clean this asshole off the road

305
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,539
What is this driving?

306
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:17,930
Is this what it looks like from back behind a different angle me driving?

307
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,049
It is it has to be

308
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,480
see

309
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,759
This is just i'm just watching mario kart ghost footage. Did somebody just come out of the jump out of the car?

310
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,319
Hit him coal spin him out

311
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,259
apprehend the suspect

312
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,259
Oh, they got in a car accident

313
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,829
All right, jeremy, that's enough reckless driving for you

314
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,680
See

315
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,339
They lived car 11k calling kgpl

316
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Code four at the lucas i'm

317
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,119
I had nothing to do with that. I had nothing to do with it

318
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:14,250
They got enough straight-on head-on collision. I didn't do that

319
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,750
Are you guys certain the code for means they died?

320
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,970
or is code for I mean

321
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,809
Like we got him

322
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,220
What does it mean?

323
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,420
cold come on

324
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,859
Code four means no further assistance. So does it mean they died?

325
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,619
You guys are telling me code four means dead

326
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,660
You gotta code four. You're fucking idiot. What?

327
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Oh, thank god, you can't go through windshields

328
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,240
We both imagine we both fly through the windshield

329
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:16,980
You can fly through the windshield and red dead. There is no windshield though

330
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,789
I'm getting fucking old

331
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,390
No, seriously, I like them

332
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,089
Look at the body of like a fucking 50 year old man

333
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,099
It turns 30 and like it's just a light switch flip

334

348
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,769

We should keep this development

353
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,480
We're all on the same team

354
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
chain of command

355
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,799
Skipper will decide who needs to know

356
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,160
Got it skipper

357
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,490
Let's investigate the crime

358
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,490
Do an impression of donkey kong?

359
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,450
Um, well, there's two different donkey kongs

360
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:46,019
Hard, isn't it? Yeah, I look out for all the rail depots because the donkey kong that could talk the negro

361
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,140
Nelson gaines called it in there is I came down here to make sure him and the other guy jameson stuck around

362
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:58,900
Jameson found the body something like that guy makes me sick. We'll talk to the coroner keep an eye on both of them

363
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:06,500
All right, let's investigate. But yeah, there's there's there's when um

364
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:13,109
What have we got here? It was when he was just a gorilla approximately 40 years of age. Remember he used to go

365
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,630
At least nothing legible

366
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:23,109
That's all he did trauma to the temple nose and eye regions ligature marks point to the probable cause of death being strangulation

367
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:29,349
He didn't have any other lines any idea of the time of death from her temperature after midnight would be my guess

368
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,369
Okay midnight

369
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,450
Okay, let's see if we can no you need to go

370
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,490
We just examine

371
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,369
No neck mark

372
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,369
No rope around the neck on uh, this

373
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:51,420
Particular case here smell very good. There is the usual evacuation smell

374
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,460
But it appears she's been living rough for quite some time

375
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:57,259
very strong smell of alcohol

376
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,940
The autopsy will tell but I would assume that she was inebriated

377
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Do funny baby voice

378
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,789
No, do funny baby voice. What does that mean?

379
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,070
The ring is gone. Another missing ring

380
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,530
It certainly seems i've been swabbing a lot of bare fingers recently

381
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,619
Can you be more exact about the time of death? He thought about it

382
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,179
I'm trying to figure out what it meant the body was in a one or two hour window

383
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,059
The baby voice is the spi voice. Uh,

384
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,699
No, but it's not though

385
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:56,019
Anything else I can't do anything else. That's nothing

386
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,579
Where are the markers?

387
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,579
Where's the this is evidence marker?

388
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,659

Well, hold on it doesn't appear to be connected

505
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,349
Okay

506
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:35,079
Once the music stops you're done. Yeah, but what did it mess up on the body?

507
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,179
No

508
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:52,039
Back to the note

509
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,730
Wait, did I not read this?

510
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,469
Is this something on the other side?

511
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:03,909
No, it's not here

512
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:05,909
Read the letter. I didn't I do that already

513
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:28,969
I I opened it before like I already did that but I didn't like scroll all the way down

514
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,239
There it is

515
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:43,510
Okay

516
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,510
Locations, let's go to the bat

517
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,960
Set as destination

518
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,400
Dangus

519
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Sorry, I opened it and read it and looked at it slow and I didn't go all the way down to the bottom of the paper

520
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,400
To get the you looked at the clue thing to pop up

521
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,880
Sorry, i'm sorry that we're sending it

522
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,010
Yeah

523
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:15,829
Yeah right about that people are starving. They can't do that want to sell the food to fund the civil war against the communist

524
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,900
Really?

525
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,019
I guess that's okay then armies can't go through

526
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,460
Oh, what is this even a rock star game?

527
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,539
Did rock star have anything to do with this game because that chain link fence goes down

528
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,590
Armies can't fight that one does

529
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,110
You spend all your money on weapons, but you still have to have the will to fight

530
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,030
unfortunately

531
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,210
The reds will win in china

532
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,849
Rockstar published the game. You know what you're saying?

533
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,530
The people of this country overthrew king you think the chinese will balk at an emperor if they are rock star

534
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,090
Sure, let's do it

535
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,170
I can't turn down a client

536
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,659
I can't turn down a chase guy around

537
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:12,699
And then shoot him was it dead in the chat. What's up, man?

538
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,519
and remarkably

539
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:34,820
Calm down not one person was injured really enjoying your game though, man

540
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Deb in the chat. That's crazy, man

541
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,190

545
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:59,059
How long did it take you to make uh some of the the animations in the game?

546
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:04,329
Like some of the facial animations like from the last cutscene dude

547
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:13,110
It took a couple months. Nice kid

548
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:25,960
No, I can't

549
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,900
Ah son of a god

550
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:39,369
Can I really not do anything? This is just what a lookout point. What's the purpose of this? So what next?

551
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,619

Uh, what happened to um the part up here?

I think the power's gone to your head felps

556
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Why would you walk back in the path?

557
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,579
Is it up there? Oh, man

558
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:22,059
This was no there is no joke. I'm just pretending to be like a streamer that has sees a deb in the chat

559
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:45,099
For a joke. No for pretend. Why don't you come on out jimmy? I'm pretending hurt you not my honey boy

560
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Wait, oh, I remember this one. This is the guy

00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,780
This is the shotgun guy, okay

562
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,730
That the lady of the house

563
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:03,820
It's a nice story two old lovebirds just moved in together, but they had a falling out and chased across the yard with a 12 gauge

564
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:12,150
now

565
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:14,949
Let's go

566
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:21,179
Multi-kill godlike

567
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,880
Shut down shut down shut down. How do you do that guy's voice?

568
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:41,289
No

569
00:51:46,699 --> 00:52:03,030
That's not how it is frog like

570
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,719
How do you make those noises with your mouth well first of all, what's up, dude? What's up kid? Thanks for coming in

571
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,119
um

572
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:27,269
For will you just shape your throat in the directions? Thanks. But hey, what's up, man? I get the point

573
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:39,980
That mailbox i'm flying

574
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:49,269
This is why people randomly hate you

575
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,630
What who hates me?

576
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,739
What who randomly hates me?

577
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,820
I don't I don't know. I I don't want people to hate me

578
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,920
but at the same time

579
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,840
If I want to if i'm gonna say godlike in a frog voice i'm gonna do it

580
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,960
And nothing's going to stop me from doing it. I need to ask you some questions concerning eveline summers, you know

581
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,219
I'm walter metch

582
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,139
eveline summers

583
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:53,980
What is it now? You knew eveline as well as I wanted to know eveline somebody really hate me because I did a frog voice

584
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,940
For five seconds and drinks. They've had any money. That'd be a really weird reason to hate somebody

585
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,260
Did you ever tell you where she was staying?

586
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,500
I don't think she was living rough. She had that kind of schtunk about yeah

587
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,900
I went to this guy's dream and he did he did like a frog voice. I fucking hate this guy

588
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,099
All right. What are we doing? What's your name?

589
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:24,280
Grover McCaffrey mind if I ask you some questions. Mr. McCaffrey. I'm just a starving rider detective

590
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:32,099
What do you want to ask about eveline summers and why she was found beaten and strangled in the rail depot on santa fe?

591
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,500
Okay

592
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,730
I see your point

593
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,730
How well did you know her?

594
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:43,050
I can't say that I knew her it was more like I was aware of her

595
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,840
What was your last contact with event? Did you see eveline last night? No

596
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:54,199
I was at home. That's bullshit writing

597
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:08,599
Maybe not. I mean you're moving around a lot though, but he's not darting his eyes around

598
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:19,849
Do you want to get dragged into this McCaffrey? Do you want us to get interested in you?

599
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,530
She hung out with this powder puff james tiernan

600
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:30,969
They haunted the public library together. Oh, well, do you know james tiernan? I know he works some kind of plebeian job

601
00:55:32,389 --> 00:55:34,389
Rawlings bowling alley

602
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,869
Brawling I know that place corner of ninth and grand a lot of cops pull there on tuesday night

603
00:55:41,590 --> 00:56:00,260
Nobody hates me right? Like nobody hates me here. Just making sure do you have a criminal record?

604
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:04,949
Nothing serious

605
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:20,179
It was a fucking joke i'm but i'm rebounding the joke

606
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:32,050
Say I had a joke force filled up. Uh, hold on. What the fuck did you just say?

607
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,610
He's doing a lot of blinking

608
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:09,940
You want to save me some time or do you want me to look up your file industrial disputes?

609
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:12,579
strikes

610
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,579
worker's rights

611
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,489
That kind of a regular fifth column

612
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,369
Nice to meet you comrade

613
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:24,150
So I was gonna do a thing and now thank you for the information to do it mccaffrey

614
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Where I was going to do?

615
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,000
a um

616
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,559
I wonder if there's an extension I could use to do it to kind of be fun

617
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,039
But this would just the reason why I can't is because this would just be the lie detector stream again

618
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:39,039
But a different version of it

619
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,719
Or I would just put the prompts on the screen and just sit in the right position and have you guys interview me?

620
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
But we already like we already did that

621
00:57:52,199 --> 00:58:09,880
Um, let's go. Let's go to the bar. Wait, we already went to the bar. There's something else here

622
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,719
Yeah, did the same camera angle and sound effects but that would take some time to put together but be fun

623
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,840
Did I miss something here?

624
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,039
You're free to speak to the regulars just don't shake them too hard

625
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,840
Go to a casino for a stream and like I I you're not allowed to film in a casino

626
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,199
You'll get a a hand swat down on your hand

627
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:57,079
I like an idea though. Why don't I just like run my own casino from my house?

628
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:00,099
you know what I mean

629
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,699
I could like instead of I could try to make some extra money on the side by

630
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,019
Inviting people over to play like blackjack in my this is a will ferrell movie. Never mind

631
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:21,800
I don't think I can do anything else here

632
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,199
I mean, there's this person here. But again, I think I can talk to thank you a friend of

633
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,079
Summers didn't ask it very cute. You know, who's asking? I know my rights

634
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,639
You don't have any answer the question

635
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,920
Evelyn mooch is for drinks. I don't have any time for that. Was that so hard?

636
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:43,559
Keep writing me copper

637
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,389
Um

638
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:58,659
Okay

639
00:59:58,659 --> 00:59:59,860
Okay

640
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,219
What's next?

641
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:05,380
Uh the liquor store. I don't know what i'm missing here, but I don't know what it is. So we're just gonna go

642
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:09,969
You hate the new wendy's ad. What is the wendy? What is it?

643
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,510
What did you make him a cafri? Let me guess

644
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:20,469
He'll come a day two close friends sitting at inside eating in the restaurant, but he's out of us here

645
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,070
Which by the way that very never very rarely does that happen?

646
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:30,469
I don't know what it is with fast food companies where they depict like whole people going in whole families and friends like having

647
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:34,949
Like getting together and sitting around like a big table and eating donald's

648
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,199
That no one does that

649
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,280
That's first that's the first mistake

650
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,260
whole people

651
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,539
And then their second mistake is people being excited about peeling off

652
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:53,139
Stickers that give you like 20 cents off of a large soda

653
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,340
Like oh man, yeah, bro. I won and they hold it up and it's like oh me too. I want a nugget

654
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,059
Nobody you ripped it off and you're like, oh, I don't fucking care

655
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,380
You never use it because you throw it in the trash. You never bring it back

656
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:12,230
What can I do for you? LAPD Phelps and Galloway. We're making inquiries into the murder of Evelyn summers

657
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,469
Evelyn

658
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:22,360
She's dead. You knew Evelyn summers, mr. Robbins. Yes. I knew Evelyn. I was a good friend of her ex-husband

659
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
She kept some of her stuff here. Yeah boardwalk and park place collect them both and you get a jet

660
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,559
Come this way you get a million dollars

661
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,960
They don't even print those, you know

662
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,900
They don't even print

663
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,260
Boardwalk they print park place and park place is so common

664
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,929
Everybody gets park place and then they go. Oh shit, dude. I just need boardwalk and i'm dead

665
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:44,929
They don't even print boardwalk. It's not even printed

666
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:57,670
The ceo of mcdonald's like he's gets on a plane to some random town in iowa

667
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:03,670
And he like slips boardwalk on one of the slips one of the drinks down and into fucking some random place

668
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:06,469
And the next person in line gets it is one printed

669
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:34,130
He did something other than drinking her spare time. Oh, she was bowler

670
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:44,210
The ceo slipped the ceo. She's like goes into a random store with quite some time. It's in a case

671
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:48,369
That large mcdonald's fucking soda

672
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:53,889
With the boardwalk on it is in a locked gold case that only the ceo is allowed to touch

673
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:55,730
and he

674
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,809
In his weird fucking creepy tower throws a dart at the board in the united states

675
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:04,369
And picks the one place that he's going to go sneak and put like a fake mustache on and drop off the golden case

676
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:17,030
One summer is what exactly did evelyn work in the pictures?

677
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:22,760
1938 worked in legal copyrights for music. Okay

678
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:29,719
You've said too much already

679
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,739
Is the volume below them i'll turn it up for you

680
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,110
picture

681
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:50,659
Okay, is that it?

682
01:03:51,219 --> 01:04:04,280
Evelyn was reading aristotle

683
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Aristotle metaphysics

684
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,639
The stupid thing about her was

685
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,719
What else is in here and she was borrowing books from grovener mcaffrey

686
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:20,119
Can I read?

687
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:22,070
um

688
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,550
Yes, yes, I know how to read. Thank you

689
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,780
She wasn't always such a loner

690
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,219
Okay

691
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:37,719
Ronald mcdonald hates you because he said all those mean things about mcdonald's

692
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,360
I didn't say anything mean about mcdonald's

693
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:45,199
What did I say bad about mcdonald's? I was just speaking

694
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:48,159
candidly in my opinion of

695
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,239
The contest of the monopoly contest

696
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,119
I didn't say it was bad

697
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,860
I I eat mcdonald's mcdonald's is fine. It tastes good big mac number one

698
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:04,369
I mean, you really can't beat a number one. I don't think

699
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,579
Big macs are awful cut nothing, but

700
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:18,500
I don't think so

701
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,900
Number two the two single cheeseburgers. I mean, it's hard to argue

702
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,880
It's hard to argue with facts. Okay, the number one from mcdonald's

703
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:31,619
Is probably the best fast food item

704
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:39,989
Besides that you're talking about the wendy's crispy chicken sandwich or scares away customers the wendy's crispy chicken sandwich

705
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,469
Or the burger king long chicken sandwich

706
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:47,010
I mean those are that I think those are tied for first place

707
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:50,869
Gentlemen, I have a store to run

708
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,860
What are we doing?

709
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,860
We're trying to account for everyone's movements. I think it's big burger king sucks. Okay morning burger king doesn't do anything good anymore

710
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,940
Let's pick up some of our things

711
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,780
Yeah, here's a burger king just goes. Hey, wait, our food sucks really bad

712
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:10,820
So let's just like dump a bunch of sauce and bacon on every sandwich and that's how that's how they get customers and it

713
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,340
tastes good

714
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:23,670
I'm surprised burger king's still in business

715
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:30,630
I look I don't hate burger king. I think it tastes fine. I mean I I ate burger king like two weeks ago and I was like

716
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,320
Oh, this is good

717
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,039
but I mean

718
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,920
You can't and the taco bell is in this here, too

719
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,199
The cheesy godita crunch beats the big mac

720
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:47,059
In a one-to-one fight, right? But if the big mac has the number two in the corner as a tag team

721
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:50,900
Nothing else on the whole taco bell menu is worth eating. You know what i'm saying?

722
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:57,860
So one-on-one fight go to keep cheesy godita crunch will win every time having cops in the store scares away customers

723
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,159
What about kfc?

724
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:07,119
stuff like that you you check filet you but no no guys guys guys

725
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,559
Like you can't bring in like the higher tiered fast food places

726
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,199
They're in different with different weight classes

727
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:19,940
Like the the featherweight doesn't fight the heavyweight. You know i'm saying they're in different weight classes

728
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,340
No, kfc is not a higher tier. Check filet is a higher tier

729
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:38,789
Arby's is a higher tier. I'm not putting kfc in high tier. I'm putting kfc in the in the other in the gentleman

730
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:43,670
I have a store to run. Arby's is garbage, but it's like it's it's but they have fresh turkey

731
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:50,920
Okay, there's fresh turkey at Arby's. They don't have that at McDonald's. What was the question? I don't even remember

732
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,519
I don't know what he even said

733
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:57,380
Can I can I review the information?

734
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:04,659
F tier kfc is good. You're all idiots

735
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:08,059
Idiots

736
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,940
You're all idiots

737
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:18,199
No, i'm not saying that i'm saying what somebody said

738
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,619
No, I was quoting what somebody else said

739
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,859
the gentleman i've

740
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,579
Okay, i'm just gonna pick one. I don't know what he did, but he looks like he's telling the truth

741
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:42,420
Any idea where the money came from? She didn't mention it, but she did say the booze was a present for a boy

742
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:46,949
She said they have been fighting and she had to make it up to her

743
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,229
Okay

744
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:57,750
I don't I don't i kfc is good. What's wrong? Are you in devil close? Mr. Robin?

745
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:03,029
How many people will be sad? It's not it's not at the same quality and tier of like

746
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:05,430
uh

747
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:08,630
What what give me give me some higher tiered like fast food places

748
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,270
You've got um

749
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,939
You've got arby's

750
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm not even paying attention anymore. Fuck. Why does this have to happen? I'm gonna lose this case

751
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:29,880
Fresh turkey

752
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,119
I've only had arby's one time. I've I have no opinion on arby's

753
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:41,340
What did he say?

754
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:48,859
I've got the impression that evelyn had been sleeping rough of late. This is why people hate you

755
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:54,140
Why am I shilling it i'm just i'm not trying to get her back on the straight and narrow

756
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:58,699
I aren't look i already told you the number one and the number two from mcdonald's to be honest

757
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:03,100
You have to have a good reason to want to get very difficult to beat on the run

758
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:06,039
Unless you're a cheese it go do the crunch

759
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:16,090
I got them both right. Do you know a friend of evelyn's by the name of mcaffrey?

760
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:21,909
Not personally

761
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:23,909
This guy just telling the truth, isn't it?

762
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,220
No, he's not

763
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,819
We're struggling for leads robbins. Did she know mcaffrey?

764
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:36,140
She idolized him

765
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,010
And what I gather the feeling was far from mutual

766
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,869
He seems to have missed eating dog food tier fast food on stream

767
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:49,829
You could see how it's all bad. It's like evelyn

768
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:54,229
None of it's like any good mr. Robbins. No problem

769
01:10:55,590 --> 01:11:00,630
I got them all correct. Hey, i'd like to make arrangements for the funeral

770
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:03,449
You think I could get in touch with evelyn's mother?

771
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,970
Put in a call to the watch commander. What's my favorite brand of chicken nugget?

772
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,529
He'll be trying to reach the next of kin. Well, thanks

773
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:17,899
I bred my own chicken nuggets and I make them from scratch. Evelyn never hurt anybody not wendy's of the bed wendy's

774
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:33,659
So we need to go

775
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:49,930
But I don't have chick-fil-a

776
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:53,289
At least I don't know if there's any around in las vegas, but in

777
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,430
Massachusetts, I don't think I think there was one chick-fil-a in the entire state of massachusetts. Let's not keep the man away. It wasn't available

778
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:08,220
Go to the bowling alley

779
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,819
We just like learned that

780
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:26,460
It's my very new place in vegas to eat

781
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:29,340
uh

782
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,340
Boy, I could never tell you

783
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,949
Some of the best restaurants i've ever eaten are here

784
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,710
so I

785
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:39,260
I can't tell you

786
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,619
I mean i

787
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:44,220
Gordon ramsay steak was probably the best piece of meat i've ever eaten

788
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:54,069
So I mean is that?

789
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:59,989
It was it just was I I can't just be like, well, you know

790
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:04,710
It was the best piece of uh, like red meat I probably ever had

791
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:17,189
Hello rusty two on your usual lane. I'm detective felts homicide. You must be new

01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:22,659
More like shoe things

794
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,180
You got a guy who works here by the name of tiernan. Sure we do

795
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,220

Go right in

798
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,079
He'll be hopping around the lanes toward the back

799
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:45,270
What a great old lady actress, he's a nice boy. Thanks, ma'am

800
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,470
That's what i'm gonna do. Let's go get it

801
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,329

When I get to be like 60 70 like 75 years old

803
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,819
I want to be the old man at the desk

804
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,380
in movies and tv shows

805
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:08,170
All right, but did she say he was like back here?

806
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:13,130
I just don't know how to dance or have to go like down the lanes. Is it like in the back?

807
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,210
That broad has socks in it for zero

808
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:18,939
That's it

809
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:21,100
Do I have to like run down the alley?

810
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:31,930
He's like where where did she say he just was i'm sorry

811
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,890
All right, we've been talking about fast food. I don't know what the case is anymore

812
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:41,609
The women don't find you handsome. Does she recommend the specialness?

813
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,649
tiernan la pd

814
01:14:50,390 --> 01:15:05,100
Oh, here we go. At least we got the camera on his face. We know what he looks like

815
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:14,539
What are you waiting for get after it? We might go faster if we weren't carrying the extra weight

816
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:16,859
Wow

817
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:22,939
These are flashy cars to be parked outside of bowling alley the lanes attract a fast-living individual with money to burn

818
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:26,300
Or a middle-aged individual with the need to feel dark

819
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:31,399
Keep it steady and i'll try to bust his tires

820
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:37,720
Hit him clean this asshole off the road

821
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:43,720
So now I have to hit him because you couldn't do your job. Don't go to sleep on me. Get me back in close

822
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,819
So i'll take care of it

823
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,460
Hit him call spit him out

824
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:56,220
Another runner at least we've got a suspect. Why do they always run?

825
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:00,939
I'm sure we've got the wrong person in more than one of these homicides, but they always seem to land

826
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:07,899
That's not him spinning out that's him just dropping through the park, okay

827
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:13,220
If this isn't the killer we can at least get him for reckless endangerment

828
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,300
That's unless he runs into a wall and it saves us all the trouble this car is going to explode

829
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:26,539
Tunnels god damn it. He'll kill himself. All right knocking into the train

830
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:28,539
I'm okay with it

831
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:36,920
fucking time

832
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,609
Hands up hands up hands up hands up hands up hands up hands up

833
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Put your hands in the air

834
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:54,520
Why is he in a train conductor uniform?

835
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:08,819
He isn't what

836
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:13,289
That's what he was wearing

837
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:16,090
So what does that mean? So that's uh, that's the suspect

838
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:18,649
So now we've got

839
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:22,500
I don't know why the bar is still on here, but now we have to go to the police station

840
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:46,649
Is mario wearing a conductor's uniform?

841
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:52,500
Um, well mario has overalls but not a train conductor's hat

842
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,819
That's what was really

843
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:57,060
Completing that thing was the train conductor hat

844
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:13,270
You're gonna kill us

845
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,350
What happened to that lady?

846
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,689
Is that lady alive?

847
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:25,689
Not with who killed this lady?

848
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,710
Uh, okay. Well, I don't know

849
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:35,560
interesting

850
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,640
You did no I didn't she fell down

851
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:44,149
I did not I ran into the medium. I didn't kill anybody

852
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:56,619
Is somebody gonna tell us what the hell is going on?

853
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,020
Is everybody knows what the heck's happening here?

854
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:02,649
Hey, maybe you guys don't even tell us what the heck is going on down here captain

855
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:06,489
Ray and mal have some concerns over the henry and molla cases

856
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:11,930
Which I don't want aired outside of this room evidence is solid captain. I agree rusty

857
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,250
It's just that corpses keep piling up

858
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,010
copycats

859
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,010
I've been banging the same drum

860
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:22,970
But the notes and the lipstick messages evlyn summers cartel classic carmine

861
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:25,369
Each woman same brand same color

862
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:31,850
Teresa tarrelson didn't have a lipstick message lipstick murderer. Technically. You're right rusty. She didn't have any lipstick

863
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,850
But she did have a message

864
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:37,529
We found it beneath her dress scraped with a sharp stick. What did it say?

865
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,770
You sure you want to know ray?

866
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,689
As far as we can be sure it said cunt bd

867
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:46,649
That's one way of looking at it

868
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,569
Looking at what?

869
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:52,890
Cunt is all about access though. You're married yours is mortgage

870
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:56,250
Some of us like to pay by installments this guy

871
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:58,890
Doesn't like to pay at all

872
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,890
Why are you so angry mal?

873
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:06,649
Because I just had to fire one of my assistants. He was a friend of jameson's god knows what he might have been up to

874
01:20:07,529 --> 01:20:12,010
Captain we have good leads in the summers case, but it's up to you to decide how we proceed

875
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:14,489

What are you doing? What are you doing? Get out of here get away from me

900
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:53,159
That's just big enough for the car, isn't it?

901
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:56,409
Come on. It's like the baby toys. Whatever

902
01:23:03,289 --> 01:23:13,210
Cole can I do it? Let's see

A 985 I can do it. I could get germa 985 on my on the front of my knuckles here

905
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:25,100
Like put if I put them together and it'll say germa 985

906
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:32,760
I could hold both my hands up like straight like high five

907
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:36,600
And instead of a high five on my fingers. It's just j e r m a 985

908
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,979
I'm not gonna do that. Why would i'm not going to do that?

909
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:27,380
Now we're gonna find wait. Hold on. I was gonna look at the list of people

910
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,250
Apparently not

911
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,590
Okay, it was on the other side. Where's mcaffery

912
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,210
mcaffery is an apartment six

913
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:47,380
apartment six

914
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,180
Six that I it's kind of hard to see it's dark

915
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:59,380
four

916
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,430
two

917
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,390
one

918
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:09,500
I don't have to go up. Do I three if I have to go up the stairs, what wouldn't this be like?

919
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,420
11 or like what different floors? No

920
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,699
Level two. All right. Come on, man

921
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:26,649
What is that?

922
01:25:26,649 --> 01:25:29,210
Doesn't look like anybody's home kick it phelps

923
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:35,850
Okay

924
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:38,250
God forbid you need to take the stairs. I'm not complaining about the stairs

925
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,250
I'm just complaining about the fact that

926
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:43,449
It should be 101 102 103

927
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:45,529
104

928
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:48,569
201 202 203 204

929
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:51,859
Here's the bottom part of that letter

930
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,180
From the letter we found beside the body

931
01:26:00,579 --> 01:26:02,899
Very least i'd say it ties mcaffery to the scene

932
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,319
Anything else?

933
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:14,199
Oh, it's also another this is a critical theory

934
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:24,300
Well, there's

935
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,579
I will say that the criminals have been very very bad at not leaving the bloody clothes

936
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,180
And murder weapon on the ground in their apartment

937
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,930
He said at least put it in the closet

938
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:44,100
And we have a book. I see carothers argues way out of this one

939
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:48,149
specifically the tire irons

940
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,250
Who are you guys?

941
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:55,449
What are you doing in here from the la pd, ma'am? Do you know where we might find mcaffery? I'm his neighbor

942
01:26:56,409 --> 01:27:01,529
Is he in trouble? Look lady we need to find him and in a hurry. Are you gonna give me trouble?

943
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:03,609
He has a pigeon coop up on the roof

944
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:10,600
He spends his mornings up there when he's been drinking how do we get up there he drinks with pigeons down the hall and up the stairs

945
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:17,960
That's kind of drunken in command of a carrier. It's kind of badass actually like surely we can get drunk with pigeons

946
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,720
A citation at least change the outfit again. Why i'm going to be officer felps

947
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:30,579
So we're gonna go up on we're gonna go up on the roof

948
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:43,529
That way stupid

949
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:48,970
Rooms 9 and 10 room 11. No, that's not it. We gotta go up. We are at the top

950
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,550
But what out the window?

951
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:58,710
No, there's roof access

952
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:15,699
Running on a hangover mcaffery sit down and we'll talk. Did he think that was gonna work?

953
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:23,859
I'm gonna throw a bird at you. Nice try don't get down

954
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:28,579
Go back up

955
01:28:28,579 --> 01:28:30,840
All right. Come here grover

956
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,239
Grover mcaffery you are under arrest

957
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,729
He just got stuck there

958
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:45,369
You a runner mcaffery stay and fight the good fight

959
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:54,779
tackle

960
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:56,260
tackle

961
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,930
tackle them

962
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:02,100
Not yet

963
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,100
Give it up la pd

964
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:07,750
I mean, I think he knows where you're from at this point felps

965
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:13,539
You're wearing a police outfit. You've said it three times. Here comes the tackle

966
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:16,020
tackle

967
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,970
tackle

968
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:20,539
tackle

969
01:29:20,539 --> 01:29:27,670
Tackle him. There it is

970
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:29,670
Can't we talk about this?

971
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,670
What the fuck?

972
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:56,739
What can't we talk about?

973
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,979
Little thing was

974
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:08,899
Uh kind of messed up

975
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:17,239
We need to get downtown and wrap this thing up. It's got to be the captain unless

976
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,079
Terran and set him up. We talk about don't think that asshole jamison could have done it. Do you?

977
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:30,020
And whoever did it brain just shut up his brain queued up that line

978
01:30:30,979 --> 01:30:35,859
And it was already into his mouth through his vocal cords by the time he was knocked out his name was never on it

979
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:42,899
If you think the list is exhaustive rusty, who am I to argue listen? Let's just work the case at hand. Shall we?

980
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:49,180
Then we can sit down for all the puzzle pieces to get right on this side

981
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,899
I ain't scared

982
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:58,470
Still gonna do it. I'm not scared

983
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:03,060
I'm not even gonna get off this either

984
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,250
Well, I passed it

985
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:18,979
Give me a break

986
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:24,149
It's too focused on driving on the tracks

987
01:31:24,789 --> 01:31:31,989
I was hoping I was hoping it was going down going to the cut scene

988
01:31:32,949 --> 01:31:40,550
But it didn't excuse excuses excuses excuse

989
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:51,659
All right, we got a lineup. We have a couple of suspect stick with one of these suspects

990
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,460
It's either mcaffrey or tiernan, sir

991
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:56,779
I think jamison is an aberration

992
01:31:57,819 --> 01:31:59,020
All right

993
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:04,619
I'll deal with that degraded lunatic myself. He's got some fearful retribution coming turn in as a one

994
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:10,090
Caffrey isn't two. I want the confession from one of them. All right, let's go

995
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:16,920
Where we go who we go first

996
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,479
Whatever one of these are strips off me at the grand jury two

997
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:23,210
Who's in in a room? You've been you're in room two

998
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:27,930
It's you ready to caffrey questions. You think I have all the answers

999
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:31,210
People who run from the police usually have something to hide

1000
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,890
Touche detective

1001
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:36,890
Let's see where this takes us

1002
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:43,590
Relate to chip with the victim, but wait a minute

1003
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:48,760
I need to see some things here because we have pawned rings rings pawned by suspect

1004
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:51,720
Percy be shelly dark hair medium height and build

1005
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:58,500
Show vagrant lifestyle missing ring good and from marks on victim's skin. The ring was gone

1006
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,180
digest after midnight

1007
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:05,220
handbag

1008
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:08,100
movie lot employee id found among victims personal effects

1009
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:15,500
This lipstick in possession of john ferdinand jameson

1010
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:24,100
Torn letter addressed to evelyn pieces found in possession of victim and mcaffrey parking tickets to hand out. This is the one

1011
01:33:24,819 --> 01:33:26,819
Okay, so this ties them together

1012
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:34,359
Inscribed this is the mcaffrey found amongst her personal things. This is his book

1013
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:39,319
So, I don't know what she is. She'd never let me borrow a library book. Oh, yeah, I got it right here

1014
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:45,449
With victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument

1015
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:50,199
And then there's a tie iron. Okay

1016
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:56,199
What is your relationship with you told us you barely knew evelyn summers. She hung around sometimes

1017
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,829
I had very little to do it

1018
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:01,430
Well, that's not true

1019
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:02,840
uh

1020
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,619
Now the question is

1021
01:34:05,619 --> 01:34:07,619
Is it like the book?

1022
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:09,939
You do you have you lent her a book?

1023
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:14,949
Like that's very clearly like your signature and you lent it to her

1024
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,270
Or this letter

1025
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:26,470
You'll have to do better than that grovener. We know about you and evelyn. Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that

1026
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:30,390
You can't link her to me

1027
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:33,859
All right. Well

1028
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:38,500
Which one is more damning though? I mean this this did he write this who wrote this?

1029
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:44,659
I mean the book is

1030
01:34:44,739 --> 01:34:46,340
It's clearly

1031
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:50,939
It just has his signature in it

1032
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:55,340
But yeah, I mean that's we know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of the metaphysics

1033
01:34:55,579 --> 01:34:57,260
I what?

1034
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:01,020
I did no such thing that bitch stole that book from my apartment

1035
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:05,260
The impudent fucking moron and that made you angry angry

1036
01:35:05,819 --> 01:35:10,779
I was livid looking up at me with that stupid face of hers begging me to forgive her

1037
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:18,359
Very good

1038
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:22,199
That's one to you detective. This guy's fucking crazy

1039
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,159
Ah

1040
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:27,159
We're not like a what?

1041
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:29,239
Okay alibi

1042
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:32,199
What's your alibi? Evelyn died sometime around midnight

1043
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,920
Remind me. Where were you?

1044
01:35:35,159 --> 01:35:37,159
I was at home

1045
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:38,729
writing

1046
01:35:38,729 --> 01:35:40,729
I'm working on a manuscript

1047
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:49,880
Uh, where are you now? You're going to need to do better if you don't want to swing for this

1048
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:55,720
I was having a political meeting in my apartment cheese and crackers for the fifth column

1049
01:35:56,199 --> 01:36:02,199
Some of these people will corroborate your story. I won't give up names of party members good

1050
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,449
Your funeral

1051
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:07,770
It's either going to be you or tier net opener

1052
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:11,289
Make it stick detective

1053
01:36:11,289 --> 01:36:13,289
The party has good lawyers

1054
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,810
No, you've got me you got me there touche

1055
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,550
Well, let's go talk to the other guy

1056
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:29,779
All right. We need interview room one

1057
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:32,979
Which is it this way?

1058
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,529
No guns. Wait, is this an interview room?

1059
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:44,789
No, this is the holding cell

1060
01:36:44,789 --> 01:36:46,789
Here's interview room one

1061
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,020
Why did you run tiernan?

1062
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,060
I was the last one to see ephelin that night. I knew you would think it was me. Oh bloody

1063
01:36:57,899 --> 01:36:59,899
All right. This is the bowling alley guy

1064
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,829
So hold on relationship with the bowling alley guy

1065
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:07,479
handbag

1066
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,430
movie lot

1067
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:11,270
uh

1068
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:14,760
Liquor purchase so liquor purchase

1069
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:19,479
Store owner robbins testifies victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument, right?

1070
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:23,340
So he's gonna he this is this is the boy, right?

1071
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:26,140
Can you describe your relationship with eveline?

1072
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:38,149
I barely knew everyone

1073
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:41,829
Sounds like half an answer to me tiernan. Were you sleeping with her?

1074
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:51,670
That's none of your business

1075
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:54,630
Aristotle's metaphysics the book that belonged to mcaffrey

1076
01:37:55,270 --> 01:38:00,630
Mccaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face. What's in his front pocket? You're saying eveline stole it

1077
01:38:01,829 --> 01:38:09,029
She wanted something of his truth

1078
01:38:09,989 --> 01:38:11,989
I mean that's he's staring

1079
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,210
Directly

1080
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:18,810
That's truth

1081
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,289
Look at his eyes. He is locked in

1082
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:26,300
You don't like mcaffrey. Do you tiernan?

1083
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,159
He's full of the common manner team, but he props up a bar like the rest of us

1084
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,739
Evelyn thought he was going to be a great novelist

1085
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,760
He had nothing but victory offer

1086
01:38:39,909 --> 01:38:42,630
Holy shit, that's wrong. He okay. So this guy

1087
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:48,729
He wasn't darting. Okay alibi for you and Evelyn were drinking together last night

1088
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:53,210
And she had no other place to stay. I don't know what happened last night

1089
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:57,130
I don't remember. We got him here because this is the little bit. Yeah, you're

1090
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:05,369
Yeah, i'm, sorry, dude. You're lying tiernan. She bought you booze and you know it you fought and i'm not lying

1091
01:39:05,449 --> 01:39:07,449
She got up and left. That was it

1092
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:12,300
well

1093
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,300
Sorry, but facts

1094
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:15,899
Stayed other ones

1095
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:21,579
She left but she came back. She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you. She told the liquor store owner

1096
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,380
You're in deep trouble, buddy

1097
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:27,260
She said she loved me

1098
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:29,260
She wanted to care for me. Oh

1099
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:32,569
Confession never stopped talking about mcaffrey confession

1100
01:39:33,529 --> 01:39:39,689
Mccaffrey was a writer and mcaffrey was a hero mcaffrey cared for the little guy. Did you kill her tiernan confession?

1101
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,250
I might as well have confession

1102
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:47,449
Kicked her out. I kicked her. She had nowhere to go in her mouth. What? Okay. Well

1103
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:51,720
Well

1104
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,119
Do you own a car tiernan? No, I don't

1105
01:39:56,789 --> 01:39:58,789
Have access to a lug wrench

1106
01:39:58,789 --> 01:40:01,829
No, we use a lot of them to clear jams in the pin setting machines

1107
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,529
No, this is okay. He's lying. But hold on. Wait, wait, wait

1108
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,840
That's not that good deck. I don't think I can connect it

1109
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:25,260
Coroner's report says that evelyn was killed with a wrench

1110
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:30,140
I think you did it and then planted the evidence at mcaffrey's apartment for us to find

1111
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:32,949
We went to his apartment

1112
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:35,109
Mcaffrey was up on the roof

1113
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:37,109
Evelyn stole the book

1114
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:41,670
Mccaffrey went crazy when he found out he said he said he would put her out of her misery

1115
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:44,310
He can be very cruel

1116
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:47,770
That was correct. Yeah, that was it from her right hand. That's strange

1117
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:51,050
She always wore it

1118
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,930
uh

1119
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:54,729
Big black circular disc with a yd in the middle

1120
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,979
It was made from an old typewriter key present from the prop department at her old movie studio 50 percent

1121
01:41:01,779 --> 01:41:03,930
We're going to talk to mcaffrey

1122
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:06,890
You need to think about what you've told us tiernan. You're not in the clear

1123
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:11,000
Okay, so

1124
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:18,729
Let's see

1125
01:41:18,729 --> 01:41:21,850
I got this gadget with guy putting recording devices in this place

1126
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:24,760
So I have to go to the other room

1127
01:41:25,909 --> 01:41:27,909
Sit down. Hey, so did you do it?

1128
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:33,779
I want to ask you another question

1129
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:36,920
access to the tire iron

1130
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:43,560
We found the lug wrench that evelyn was battered with in your apartment and the note from her mother and your blood-stained clothing

1131
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,880
We have you cold mcaffrey

1132
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:52,840
You think if I could be bothered to murder evelyn summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment

1133
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:03,539
Tiernan testifies to threats of violence against victim made by

1134
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,060
gaffrey

1135
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,779
so

1136
01:42:07,779 --> 01:42:09,399
We got you

1137
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:12,760
I don't believe you grovener. The evidence says that you killed her

1138
01:42:13,899 --> 01:42:16,300
You can prove that I wanted to kill evelyn

1139
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:26,060
Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened evelyn's life in his presence

1140
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:28,539
Self-preservation

1141
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:30,380
That's understandable

1142
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:35,800
Okay, i'll level with you. This guy's so weird tiernan killed evelyn

1143
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:40,439
He came to me for help. I listened to him and he explained why he did it

1144
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,159
Tiernan went to you for help. It's not to come to buy that back. That's how it went down

1145
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,000
Back and forth a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away

1146
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,359
If he went to the cops I took his things and told him I would dispose of them, but you didn't

1147
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:57,239
Speak to tiernan

1148
01:42:57,319 --> 01:42:59,319
Okay, god

1149
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:02,600
Okay, so I now we gotta go back in there and say hey

1150
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:07,239
Uh, he says you did it. Well, he did it. Well, he says you did it. Well, I say he did it

1151
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:10,279
Jesus

1152
01:43:10,279 --> 01:43:16,420
Okay

1153
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:24,359
Oops wrong way

1154
01:43:24,359 --> 01:43:30,569
Where's the other interview room?

1155
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,420
No, no god

1156
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:47,750
You spoken to mcaffrey I can go I hate the

1157
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:54,229
Camera spin third person angle that they stuff in these have these small corridors

1158
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,649
Okay, so

1159
01:44:00,649 --> 01:44:04,170
Rawlings bowling alley employee and friend. Yeah, okay. Wait, wait. So let me see

1160
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:07,050
Here's this accusation

1161
01:44:07,899 --> 01:44:12,300
gaffer testifies to tiernan confessing and asking for help disposing of evidence

1162
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:23,659
So evelyn passed out and you walked out. What happened next? I woke up in the morning

1163
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:26,619
Mary hung over

1164
01:44:26,619 --> 01:44:30,390
I thought evelyn would have come back

1165
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,739
Okay

1166
01:44:34,739 --> 01:44:36,340
Uh well

1167
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:41,859
I know you're lying james. You went out looking for her. Tell me what really happened

1168
01:44:42,659 --> 01:44:45,029
I don't know what you're talking about

1169
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:48,279
How can you say I wasn't in that hotel room?

1170
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:52,789
This is a dub

1171
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:55,430
Can't we just hook like something up to your brain and see what your thoughts are?

1172
01:44:56,869 --> 01:45:00,710
You wound up in mcaffrey's you were still incredibly drunk. You passed out on his floor

1173
01:45:00,949 --> 01:45:02,949
It's time to tell me what really happened

1174
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:09,670
mcaffrey

1175
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,390
Woke me up. Wait a minute. Is this for real?

1176
01:45:13,909 --> 01:45:15,909
He showed me the log wrench and

1177
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:18,069
the letter and the box

1178
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:22,460
And he said I came in with him last night

1179
01:45:27,579 --> 01:45:29,579
He said that I killed Evelyn

1180
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:32,619
But what if he didn't though, did you? Then it was all over the radio

1181
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:38,939
And he would protect me

1182
01:45:38,939 --> 01:45:42,300
And I don't know detective for the life of me. I can't remember a goddamn thing

1183
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,510
I was angry with her

1184
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:47,590
Really angry I could have done it

1185
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:54,140
Wasn't me

1186
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,020
I don't know

1187
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:58,020
I don't know. There's not enough evidence

1188
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:07,380
uh

1189
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,380
So the scenario is

1190
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:11,319
other guy

1191
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:16,600
Tiernan Tiernan tells hey, I found all this stuff in your apartment and you killed this girl

1192
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:19,989
And he doesn't remember anything from the night before

1193
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:22,760
But what's

1194
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,760
I don't that's too fishy for me

1195
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:34,760
It's weird

1196
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,729
He was

1197
01:46:38,729 --> 01:46:41,689
Wait here

1198
01:46:41,689 --> 01:46:44,439
Uh, is there any?

1199
01:46:50,569 --> 01:46:55,779
I don't know if you're I'm the other guy I think

1200
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,840
Let me like talk to this guy one more time. I think we bust in there and find the goddamn evidence

1201
01:47:05,399 --> 01:47:08,920
Can I talk to you for a second?

1202
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
Railroad someone else

1203
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,920
I'm not saying anything

1204
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,979
Uh-oh

1205
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:22,380
I can't I can't talk to this guy

1206
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:27,619
Phone phone phone phone. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I but

1207
01:47:28,579 --> 01:47:30,579
Yes, there's a phone here

1208
01:47:31,939 --> 01:47:37,130
Operator give me dispatch

1209
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:42,149
Cole felps batch 12 47

1210
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:49,640
Thank you, I need the jacket on a grovener mcafee

1211
01:48:00,199 --> 01:48:11,460
Oh god, oh god. All right. Well, he did it. Thanks. Need a drink. I got the jitters again

1212
01:48:13,819 --> 01:48:15,979
Well way to make it real easy for me

1213
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:31,340
James tiernan i'm charging you with the murder. Oh, well wrong guy

1214
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,340
Oh my head. Oh, I have an instant headache

1215
01:48:41,289 --> 01:48:43,289
Oh

1216
01:48:44,409 --> 01:48:46,409
Load how do I load that scene?

1217
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,130
I need to reload the cut scene

1218
01:48:51,289 --> 01:48:55,770
Oh, he didn't do it. I knew it. I just I went the wrong room and oh I

1219
01:48:56,649 --> 01:48:58,649
Whoa, my blood pressure just went up to like a hundred

1220
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,380
How do how do I restart that?

1221
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:08,359
That's not the guy I wanted to assume that you both have very good excuses for what happened to my station today

1222
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:12,600
You had a perfectly good candidate for a capital case and some

1223
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,479
But quit it quits. That's what was it gonna put me though, man

1224
01:49:16,279 --> 01:49:20,119
What's it gonna put me? What's it gonna put me?

1225
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:33,619
Is it gonna be all right?

1226
01:49:33,619 --> 01:49:36,579
I you guys all know that's not what I want to do. I just like pressed

1227
01:49:36,739 --> 01:49:38,739
I was in the wrong place to press the wrong button

1228
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:42,810
I you know, I solved the mystery

1229
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:47,130
I just gave myself like fucking migraine

1230
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:50,149
I just gotta electrocute it up here

1231
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,890
Pretending for no, I swear to god. I just

1232
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,770
I mixed up the names

1233
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:18,710
13 if she was a day

1234
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:21,350
Okay, so hold we just we we're just gonna do this again

1235
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:26,140
We knew what I was gonna do. We just gotta skip ready to answer some questions

1236
01:50:26,619 --> 01:50:31,260
You think I have all the answers. I don't remember the things I did who run from the police usually have something to hide

1237
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,140
to shade

1238
01:50:34,619 --> 01:50:38,699
Okay, so let's see where this takes us. It was the book, right?

1239
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:44,520
You told us you barely knew eveline summers. She hung around sometimes

1240
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,960
I had very little to do with her

1241
01:50:49,939 --> 01:50:55,699
Okay, so this is the book you'll have to do better than that grogner we know about you and eveline

1242
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:58,659
Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that

1243
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:01,699
You can't link her to me

1244
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:04,979
Oh

1245
01:51:04,979 --> 01:51:11,060
God, it gave myself a fucking migraine. We know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of the metaphysics

1246
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,979
I what?

1247
01:51:12,979 --> 01:51:16,739
I did no such thing that bitch stole that book from my apartment

1248
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:20,979
The impudent fucking moron and that made you angry angry

1249
01:51:21,619 --> 01:51:26,819
I was livid looking up at me with that string some more water. I have been drinking water

1250
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:31,399
God damn it. Aha

1251
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:35,579
Very good. That's one to you detective

1252
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:42,100
Evelyn died sometime around midnight

1253
01:51:42,579 --> 01:51:44,760
Remind me. Where were you?

1254
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,840
I was at home

1255
01:51:47,079 --> 01:51:48,420
writing

1256
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:50,420
I'm working on a manuscript

1257
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:54,020
Okay, that's uh, that was a lie

1258
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,619
You're gonna need to do better if you don't want to swing for this

1259
01:51:58,939 --> 01:52:03,579
I was having a political meeting in my apartment cheese and crackers for the fifth column

1260
01:52:03,979 --> 01:52:11,260
Some of these people will corroborate your story. I won't give up names party same mistake. I'm not i'm not gonna pretend I

1261
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:15,500
I'm not gonna it's either gonna be you or tiernan grobner

1262
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:18,140
You want to go back and make stick?

1263
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,539
I'm I did it wrong party has good lawyers

1264
01:52:21,899 --> 01:52:27,100
You want to go back? I just need to correct the mistake that I made. I'm not I don't care about the in between

1265
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:29,579
I'm gonna go cheese and get a perfect score

1266
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:34,090
No, that's not fair. All right telephone

1267
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,300
Uh apparent apparently not

1268
01:52:39,779 --> 01:52:43,560
Telephone isn't here yet

1269
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,159
No, I didn't cheese. I made I made a mistake and I pressed the wrong button

1270
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:54,500
Fucking god

1271
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:59,029
Yeah, the goddamn way nice guy. I felt lousy coloring

1272
01:52:59,979 --> 01:53:06,359
Why did you run tiernan? I was the last one to see ephelin that night. Okay, I knew you would think it was me

1273
01:53:07,159 --> 01:53:11,430
I really describe your relationship with the same mistakes

1274
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:16,149
It's got to be authentic. I barely knew her bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit

1275
01:53:18,409 --> 01:53:22,010
Sounds like half an answer to me tiernan. Were you sleeping with her?

1276
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:25,000
That's none of your business

1277
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,439
Yep. Yep. Yep. We got that one wrong. I remember aristotle's metaphysics the book that belonged to mcaffrey

1278
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,359
mcaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face. I'm gonna do the same things I did before and stole it

1279
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:41,079
She we're not cheesing a 100 i'm doing the same answers

1280
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:47,130
We either hang this on you or mcaffrey. You better give us something

1281
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:54,300
Mccaffrey's been in trouble with the law before I mean he always makes out with some kind of labor dispute, but

1282
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:57,210
You know, i'm not so sure

1283
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:59,210
Lame streamer. How dare you? How dare you?

1284
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:06,329
You and eveline were drinking together last night and she had no other place to stay. I don't know what happened last night

1285
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:14,010
I don't remember liquor purchase. I've got you. You're lying tiernan. You've been fighting with her you fought

1286
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:19,210
And i'm not lying. She got up and left. That was it trailer moment. By the way, that was in the trailer

1287
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:25,050
She left but she came back

1288
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:28,810
She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you. She told the liquor store owner

1289
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:31,670
You're in deep trouble, buddy

1290
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:34,489
She said she loved me

1291
01:54:34,569 --> 01:54:37,460
She wanted to care for me

1292
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:39,460
She would never stop talking about mcaffrey

1293
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:46,100
And mcaffrey was a writer and mcaffrey was a hero mcaffrey cared for the little guy. Did you kill her?

1294
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:50,819
Might as well. I just keep flashing back to my brain kicked her out

1295
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:54,279
She had nowhere to go

1296
01:54:54,279 --> 01:54:56,199
access to the murder weapon

1297
01:54:56,199 --> 01:54:58,600
Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right

1298
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,420
Have access to a lug wrench

1299
01:55:03,659 --> 01:55:06,460
We use a lot of them to clear jams in the pin setting machines

1300
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,939
Corner's report says that evelyn was killed with a wrench

1301
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:16,739
I think you did it and then planted the evidence at mcaffrey's apartment for us to find

1302
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:19,619
We went to his apartment

1303
01:55:19,699 --> 01:55:21,779
Mcaffrey was up on the roof

1304
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:23,779
Evelyn stole the book

1305
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:28,340
Mcaffrey went crazy when he found out he said he said he would put her out of her misery

1306
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:31,060
He can be very cruel

1307
01:55:31,779 --> 01:55:34,500
Evelyn was missing a ring from her right hand. That's strange

1308
01:55:35,859 --> 01:55:37,859
She always wore it

1309
01:55:38,659 --> 01:55:41,460
Big black circular disc with a yd in the middle

1310
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:47,140
Present from the prop department at her old movie studio

1311
01:55:47,699 --> 01:55:50,619
We're going to talk to mcaffrey

1312
01:55:50,619 --> 01:55:53,500
You need to think about what you've told us tiernan. You're not in a clue

1313
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:11,770
That's all I hear that's all I can hear right now. All right, let's go accuse mcaffrey first

1314
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:19,399
We've got an accusation that you did it

1315
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:26,100
Wait back here. I've not said my piece yet

1316
01:56:26,739 --> 01:56:30,069
Do I have to do this first?

1317
01:56:30,069 --> 01:56:32,069
Why is he telling me what to do?

1318
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,619
I can't get up

1319
01:56:35,619 --> 01:56:37,859
I can't get up

1320
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:40,420
Why is he commanding me to to stay?

1321
01:56:48,229 --> 01:56:54,869
We found the lug wrench that evelyn was battered with in your apartment and the note from her mother and your blood-stained clothing

1322
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:57,189
We have you cold mcaffrey

1323
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:04,149
You think if I could be bothered to murder evelyn summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment

1324
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:10,380
I don't believe you grovener. The evidence says that you killed her

1325
01:57:11,539 --> 01:57:13,939
You can prove that I wanted to kill evelyn

1326
01:57:15,609 --> 01:57:19,159

01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:25,880

I listened to him and he explained why he did it tiernan went to you for help you expect me to buy that

1333
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,460
Well, that's how it went down. That's how it went down

1334
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:47,220
He made a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away if he went to the cops

1335
01:57:47,699 --> 01:57:52,579
I took his things and told him I would dispose of them sometimes I mean depends if there's a certain scenario

1336
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,170
He'll give it up

1337
01:57:56,170 --> 01:58:01,369
Okay. Thank you

01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:43,020
Just a moment detective different voice was formerly under surveillance by the red squad convictions for pet to death. Thank you

1345
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,250
Okay, uh, so

1346
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:52,569
Put him down with my sap

1347
01:58:52,569 --> 01:58:56,069
Is that all we need?

1348
01:58:56,069 --> 01:59:04,340
What happened here?

1349
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:06,340
Do I have to do the other guy first here?

1350
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:10,659
I've not said my piece yet. The thing was I was a really nice guy. I felt lousy coloring him

1351
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:14,600
Who what?

1352
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:16,920
You were in the war. Yes, I was

1353
01:59:18,229 --> 01:59:25,529
Seeing the things that I saw it changes a man. I came back here determined to change things

1354
01:59:26,569 --> 01:59:28,250
All I wanted was

1355
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:29,609
a pen

1356
01:59:29,609 --> 01:59:34,649
And an opportunity to speak out you told us before that you had only minor run-ins with the police

1357
01:59:35,369 --> 01:59:40,409
You didn't mention petty theft i've never been in trouble for violence. That's the salient point here, isn't it?

1358
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:47,510
You're lying mcaffrey. You have a history of violence towards women

1359
01:59:47,829 --> 01:59:51,750
How do you turn a couple parking tickets in a petty theft misdemeanor?

1360
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,390
into an assault charge

1361
01:59:54,630 --> 01:59:56,069
because

1362
01:59:56,069 --> 01:59:59,340
We've got it

1363
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,340
I almost just clicked this

1364
02:00:04,789 --> 02:00:06,630
I would have been very upset

1365
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:08,630
I would have been very upset

1366
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:15,869
We know all about you and your dishonorable discharge beating some poor woman near to death in syracuse

1367
02:00:16,329 --> 02:00:22,090
You've never been in combat mcaffrey your whole life is a fraud. She was a goddamn peasant whore

1368
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:25,930
Try to steal from my wallet. I could have fought for this country

1369
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:32,569
I could have you beat her because she stole from you because she tried to outsmart you the ignorant audacity of the bitch

1370
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:35,210
What is a man supposed to do?

1371
02:00:35,289 --> 02:00:37,289
Sit there and take it

1372
02:00:37,449 --> 02:00:43,689
How is a man supposed to call himself a man and eveline summers a poor drunken nobody stole your book

1373
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:46,090
And she got what was coming to her

1374
02:00:47,159 --> 02:00:49,479
Oh well, i'll see you

1375
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:55,880
In the slammer mcaffrey i'm charging you with the murder of eveline. That's what was supposed to happen

1376
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,680
She was a sad lady who never hurt anyone except herself

1377
02:00:59,479 --> 02:01:01,479
I hope god finds a way to forgive you

1378
02:01:04,939 --> 02:01:08,380
Wrong guy congratulations boys you bagged the fine catch

1379
02:01:08,779 --> 02:01:15,340
Another red to boot go back do it again. He didn't do it. I want you to put this business about a repeat offender out of your mind

1380
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:19,979
This mcaffrey creature shows no remorse and neither will the grand jury

1381
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:29,479
The walk along might a better candidate for an unmarked plot at the prison graveyard. Thanks dad

1382
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
all right, so

1383
02:01:43,079 --> 02:01:46,600
I am going to find out first. That's not bad only

1384
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,560
Uh, it's too much damage

1385
02:01:50,619 --> 02:01:59,909
No injuries though. All right, so i'm going to uh get a drink

1386
02:02:01,579 --> 02:02:03,579
After we get a point to stop there

1387
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:11,159
We have lost most of shaughnessy and dunny squad his gunny is dead first platoon is in worse shape

1388
02:02:11,239 --> 02:02:15,479
That medic is the crazy the bravest man alive that we rally with the first they try for the nambus

1389
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,239
It's seared to the left to the right. He goes right through a pass with two nambus and inflate

1390
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,560
Peanut butter

1391
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:31,479
Smoothie that sounds pretty good

1392
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:56,979
We keep getting those flashbacks

1393
02:03:04,039 --> 02:03:14,500
Murders coming up next well done lads you did well with the summer's case

1394
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:19,699
We have a problem the examiner received the new letter today. Do you mind if I take a look ray?

1395
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:23,689
Go right ahead

1396
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:28,550
They've both been rinsed in gasoline like the previous letters so I can't lift the print

1397
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:40,039
Uh, come find me know about this message where I hid myself

1398
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:56,460
Okay looking

1399
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:01,539
Another snippet from the cellar looking in wonder up to heaven while yet the music peeled along

1400
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:03,779
I hid myself within a fountain in the public square

1401
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:07,779
Right lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves

1402
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:14,500
Waste of paper man. You could have added a little bit more a couple more paragraphs

1403
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
All right. Uh, let me just

1404
02:04:19,899 --> 02:04:23,579
Percy the poetic works of percy

1405
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,300
be she shelly

1406
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:34,819
Suffer woes which hope thinks infinite to forgive wrongs darker than death one night

1407
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:38,579
To defy power which seems omnipotent

1408
02:04:39,539 --> 02:04:42,100
To love and bear to hope till hope creates

1409
02:04:42,819 --> 02:04:44,619
from now

1410
02:04:44,619 --> 02:04:46,619
Until my final watch

1411
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:51,619
Because it's time to start the night's watch. I don't remember it

1412
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:55,539
I don't know the I don't know how it goes if the note is from the dalian maniac

1413
02:04:55,859 --> 02:05:00,579
He definitely also i'll be back now and I agree i'll see you in a minute. I'm gonna make

1414
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:07,140
If this is the dalian killer and he is responsible for the tarot's and murder not to mention the mallard hang on a moment skipper

1415
02:05:07,779 --> 02:05:09,779
Let me finish rusty

1416
02:05:10,329 --> 02:05:12,729
We have five birds in hand and not yet the bush

1417
02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:17,609
The department will not survive a scandal if we have to let them all go without catching a feint first

1418
02:05:18,329 --> 02:05:20,329
Your careers would be over for a start chet

1419
02:05:22,949 --> 02:05:27,189
Looking in wonder. Oh fucking I knew this technical support would be true

1420
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:32,710
I hid myself within a fountain in the public square. You like that stuff

1421
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,670
What is it supposed to mean?

1422
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:40,390
Forget what it's supposed to what does he want? Where are you going with this call? He's obviously taunting us

1423
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:46,949
He believes he's far more intelligent than we okay, it's some kind of story, right a guy that god hates chains him up

1424
02:05:47,029 --> 02:05:50,229
It's an allegory rusty a story with two meanings

1425
02:05:50,789 --> 02:05:53,829
Which one of the guys in the room is the guy plant and all that's doing this?

1426
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:57,430
Within a fountain and it's gonna be somebody in the world

1427
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:02,710
Somebody tell me what the fuck is going on the fountain in pershing square

1434
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,779

Two minutes i'm gonna make a smoothie beer back

1439
02:11:23,829 --> 02:11:33,529
Uh, by the way, I made this a little too thick it's kind of like it's like a drinking paint

1440
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:39,220
What are you waiting for?

1441
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:42,170

City park, okay. It's the current destination. I was I was so all in the ball last night

02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:30,970
Like i'm lost

1451
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:39,510
This seriously has the same consistency as paint though. This is like drinking paint. Oh jerma

1452
02:12:39,510 --> 02:12:42,229
How do you know what would paint taste like because i've drank it a lot

1453
02:12:51,979 --> 02:12:56,779
All those cases rusty what have I been telling you all along we've got to get this guy I know

Enough women have died. Yeah, and it's our ass is on the line too felps

02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:07,760
You are what the captain said. Okay department is not going to take responsibility for all those bad convictions

1456
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:13,659
Success is a double-edged sword. Let's just get this sick pervert. It's beautiful by the way

1457
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:18,380
By the way, by the way, by the way, you know what? I love I love uh, you know, by the way

Watch where you're driving you what happened rather you than me felps

Oh, wait, wait, wait, that's right. That's right. That's right in the fountain. We shall shine

Well, what by the way, I love how that would be my like number if it was potential

1468
02:14:37,130 --> 02:14:48,840
That was potential

1469
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:55,479
Use your words and make it count. You're all overgrown with trailing odorous plants which curtain out the day

1470
02:14:57,270 --> 02:15:01,750
Where next?

1471
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:05,029

1474
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:57,189
Hidden vehicle

02:15:57,189 --> 02:16:11,989
This is a huge map go get the hidden car

1476
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:22,020
We're in the middle of a mission

1477
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:26,699
Uh, hold on a minute. Let me

1478
02:16:26,779 --> 02:16:27,739

1479
02:16:27,739 --> 02:16:33,430

1480
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:38,600
What was the can I look at the excerpt again?

1481
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:43,379
Please right

1482
02:16:43,379 --> 02:16:46,420
There's a cave all overgrown with trailing odorous plants

1483
02:16:47,059 --> 02:16:49,459
Which curtain out the day with leaves and flowers?

1484
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:56,899
And paved with veined emerald in a fountain leaps in the midst with an awakening sound from its curved roof the mountain's frozen

1485
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:02,500
Tears like snow or silver or long diamond spires hang downward raining. Well, I don't know what this is

1486
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:17,030
How the fuck am I supposed to find this

1487
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:21,430
Is it another fountain?

1488
02:17:21,430 --> 02:17:23,430

The station could be a cave

1492
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:39,799
Cave bingo

02:39:29,959 --> 02:39:32,840
So it would be okay to find that landmark yet

1659
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:37,319
I hope you're right. I would have found it be famous

1660
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:46,889
I would have it's me. I'm the killer

1661
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:55,819
So, you know how like some references and some jokes and memes just live forever

1662
02:39:56,459 --> 02:39:58,540
Do you think that I made this I did it?

1663
02:39:59,579 --> 02:40:01,579
You think it's ever gonna go away ever?

1664
02:40:02,139 --> 02:40:04,139
I don't think it will I think it's here forever

1665
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:13,420
I won't let it

1666
02:40:14,729 --> 02:40:30,010
No, I wonder who actually is the first person to do it

1667
02:40:31,209 --> 02:40:36,780
I wonder if they're here right now, you know, that'd be interesting

1668
02:40:37,659 --> 02:40:39,659
If they were here

1669
02:40:39,659 --> 02:40:57,559

02:42:19,930 --> 02:42:25,750
Why did I just freeze?

02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:27,350
Can I walk in this?

1679

02:43:23,959 --> 02:43:26,600
What the fuck? Holy shit. I thought that was actually an animal

1685
02:43:27,079 --> 02:43:40,819
What am I supposed to be looking at here? I mean, this is definitely a point a location here

Move quickly between safe platforms

1694
02:44:54,840 --> 02:45:07,510
I am moving quick. I can't go that way that quickly. He's dead. He died that fast

1695
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:18,360
How did anybody do why are these boards here who did maintenance here this is all fucked up

1696
02:45:24,340 --> 02:45:27,030
Whoa connect the dots

1697
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:34,420
I'd be doing better if you were the one trying to get across this thing straight or right right

1698
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:56,579
Easy to the island steady bag a right

1699
02:45:58,579 --> 02:46:01,659
That's at the forefront of my thinking

1700
02:46:02,729 --> 02:46:04,489
This is long

1701
02:46:04,489 --> 02:46:05,690

1702
02:46:05,690 --> 02:46:06,889
Right

1703
02:46:06,889 --> 02:46:15,020
So what was what's on here that I need?

1704
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,450

1705
02:46:17,450 --> 02:46:18,649
shoes

1706
02:46:18,649 --> 02:46:24,020
One of theresa tarreltson's shoes

1707
02:46:24,659 --> 02:46:28,620
Okay, besides this there's eight

1708
02:46:34,819 --> 02:46:37,379
From the other opening as many thousands fears

1709
02:46:38,739 --> 02:46:40,739
Okay, where to now?

02:47:00,329 --> 02:47:05,610
Oh, I really thought that hobo bun. Why couldn't I just get in one of these fashion from the insane aren't the most credible evidence

1714
02:47:05,690 --> 02:47:06,889
for us

1715
02:47:06,889 --> 02:47:12,170
This thing over it's all part of his power over making us run around all over the city for the

1716
02:47:13,290 --> 02:47:15,370
So if we keep this up we can find the guy

1717
02:47:23,899 --> 02:47:25,899
How many are there

1718
02:47:25,899 --> 02:47:29,530
fifth excerpt

1719
02:47:29,530 --> 02:47:31,530
This is the fifth time i've had to do this

1720
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:35,879
Okay from wood opening the wood russian loud and whirlwind harvey sphere

Sphere. Oh, I didn't even need that first attempt. That's right here. Got it done. I'm really glad it's right here

1724
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:14,579
I hope this is it. So this guy looks out for women in bars. You've had too much to drink

1725
02:48:15,139 --> 02:48:19,860
Who are emotionally disturbed need a shoulder to cry on he plies them with booze

1726
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:24,100
Probably offers them a lift home then beats their brains out and strangles

1727
02:48:24,979 --> 02:48:26,979
Could be any schmoll hanging out

1728
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:31,379
Breathe just a wooden fence dammit. That's a wooden fence

1729
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:34,340
You're telling me I can't drive through

1730
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:42,729
No, not anyone he displays the bodies leaves us messages for all the violence. It's very controlled behavior

1731
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:48,420
Really good wooden fence

1732
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,840
Now what do we have to traverse?

1733
02:48:59,559 --> 02:49:01,559
No, don't you fucking dare?

1734
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:06,520
I'm playing resident evil 4 again

1739
02:49:27,459 --> 02:49:28,659
Okay

1740
02:49:28,659 --> 02:49:30,659
I'm gonna try to reach the center of the maze

1741
02:49:31,299 --> 02:49:42,040
You ever been in here gal? I got to do that again. No, I have no intention of going in

1742
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:45,979
I heard that thing's tricky

1743
02:49:45,979 --> 02:49:48,299
I'm gonna wait here and have a quiet smoke

1744
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:53,850
think about hidden meetings

1745
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:55,850
It's been a while since i've been able to

1746
02:49:55,850 --> 02:49:57,739
To do that

1747
02:49:57,739 --> 02:49:59,340
Dolores

1748
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:01,340
Good to see you again

1749
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:04,600

02:50:05,319 --> 02:51:05,850
Ha ha ha ha ha

1751
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:17,930
Once belonging to selene axeford henry

1752
02:51:19,819 --> 02:51:23,020
All right. Here's the big the big climax right here

1753
02:51:24,139 --> 02:51:26,940
Well, you found me but not so fast. I admit

1754
02:51:27,659 --> 02:51:30,059
Thrones author is another one

1755
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:39,700
No, it couldn't be

1756
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,579
Cutscene thank god

1757
02:51:55,129 --> 02:51:56,170
See

1758
02:51:56,170 --> 02:51:58,889
That was easy. I found selene henry's ring

1759
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:01,610
How far does this thing go?

1760
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:03,690
I was in there for a long time

1761
02:52:03,930 --> 02:52:17,819
It took me a long time to get out

1762
02:52:17,819 --> 02:52:21,399
All right. What's a good clue again?

1763
02:52:26,059 --> 02:52:28,059
Thrones author's judgment seats prisons

1764
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:32,360
Which wretched men were born to see our sword chains

1765
02:52:33,079 --> 02:52:35,719
Reason wrong glows ignorance where those monsters

1766
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:38,440
Are buried ghosts of okay?

1767
02:52:39,079 --> 02:52:49,049

1768
02:52:49,049 --> 02:52:54,700

1770
02:52:56,620 --> 02:53:06,299
No throne

1771
02:53:06,299 --> 02:53:08,299
Was it was a throne there?

1772
02:53:12,409 --> 02:53:13,770

Leading us this trail of evidence

1784
02:54:25,430 --> 02:54:27,430
Why vanity?

1785
02:54:27,430 --> 02:54:30,309
He wants to see if there's anyone out there smart enough to catch him

1786
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:35,899
He leaves us evidence, but every location is a trap. Why testing us?

1787
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:40,860
Physically and mentally to see whether we are worthy of him the titan guy

1788
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:48,889
Very good. You're thinking about reading some jelly all that egghead stuff

1789

02:54:53,620 --> 02:54:57,399

03:00:46,729 --> 03:00:49,420
fighter ring helen summers

1830
03:00:53,219 --> 03:00:55,559
All right

1831
03:00:55,559 --> 03:00:56,520
E

1832
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:58,819
There it is

1833
03:00:59,620 --> 03:01:05,620
No a seventh excerpt placey. Why did this game become so fucking boring? What the hell man?

1834
03:01:06,899 --> 03:01:19,620
This game was very interesting and fun

1835
03:01:21,049 --> 03:01:24,329
I really don't want to do this again. So the seventh time

1836
03:01:28,299 --> 03:01:30,299
It has to do with reading it has to do with

1837
03:01:31,100 --> 03:01:40,180
seven times

1838
03:01:40,180 --> 03:01:42,180
There it is. Give me the cut scene

1839
03:02:21,979 --> 03:02:36,729
I thought the whole thing was gonna come crashing down

1840
03:02:37,370 --> 03:02:42,889
It almost did I thought so too. Oh, he murdered Evelyn summers rusty. The last trophy was her ring

1841
03:02:43,209 --> 03:02:45,209
What did it say on the piece of the poem? Yes

1842
03:02:46,010 --> 03:02:49,450
I would love to say it you sure call but it'll antagonize chat

1843
03:02:51,670 --> 03:02:53,670
Seventh excerpt here we go

1844
03:02:53,829 --> 03:02:56,950
um two three four five six seven eight nine ten no two three four five

1845
03:02:58,729 --> 03:03:00,489
remit anguish that

1846
03:03:00,489 --> 03:03:02,809
Delighted stare close thy one lips

1847
03:03:03,370 --> 03:03:11,049
Let that thorn wounded brow stream not blood it mingles with thy tears fix fix fix those tortured orbs and

1848
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:13,530
peace and deaths of the sick rose

1849
03:03:13,930 --> 03:03:15,930
Shake not that crucifix

1850
03:03:16,409 --> 03:03:21,129
So those pale figures play thy now go horrible thy name. I will not speak of that become a curse

1851
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:24,170
I know what it is

1852
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:36,840
You just you said you said the word crucifix. That's all I needed. All right, where is it?

1853
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:44,040
Where is it an angel? Wait, maybe i'm wrong angel

1854
03:03:57,979 --> 03:04:01,020
Cry cry. There it is. That's that's the thorn

1855
03:04:01,979 --> 03:04:05,020
There it is. That's church. I just needed to find the church

1856
03:04:05,979 --> 03:04:16,069
It might seem like crucifix ain't the archaeo theater god's sake belps i'm not trying to justify this

1857
03:04:17,030 --> 03:04:18,940
Hear me out

1858
03:04:18,940 --> 03:04:21,440
This guy has been successfully slaughtering

1859
03:04:23,579 --> 03:04:30,379
Maybe longer the research is weak and then plants evidence so that we always have someone to go at if he hadn't sent the

1860
03:04:30,379 --> 03:04:32,379
letters in the poem

1861
03:04:47,979 --> 03:04:49,979
Okay, where is he

1862
03:04:50,139 --> 03:04:56,120
Where is the bad guy?

1863
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:58,920
Boom doors break open. All right there you found me

1864
03:04:59,879 --> 03:05:01,879
He'll never take me alive

1865
03:05:05,850 --> 03:05:07,770
He's gonna be praying at the altar

1866
03:05:07,770 --> 03:05:23,190
Watch this praying at the altar. He was a religious nut the whole time. Look out

1867
03:05:39,190 --> 03:05:44,549
We're from the la pd sir i'm gonna tell you only once to lower your weapon

1868
03:05:45,270 --> 03:05:47,270
The la pd you say

1869
03:05:47,350 --> 03:05:54,219
Is it really possible you could have found me after all this done the gun shit bird

1870
03:05:54,860 --> 03:05:58,459
Last warning this foolish ignoramus could never have found me

1871
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:01,100
It was you wasn't it?

1872
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:09,110
Remember me detective the temp bartender. Yes, you found it. Oh, it was the bartender

1873
03:06:10,469 --> 03:06:12,709
What walk in here like lamps

1874
03:06:14,549 --> 03:06:16,309
What a reveal

1875
03:06:16,309 --> 03:06:22,379
I can't believe it. It was the temporary bartender not like the captain or me or

1876
03:06:22,940 --> 03:06:34,860
Where did he go? Where did he go on the tunnel?

1877
03:06:35,420 --> 03:06:37,909
He can't let the son of a bitch get away

1878
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:43,100
The house rusty there must be another entrance into the house. He did say it was me though

1879
03:06:43,819 --> 03:06:51,750
Into the catacombs

1880
03:06:56,440 --> 03:07:00,010
I'm gonna turn the dial. It's a secret

1881
03:07:00,809 --> 03:07:02,250
Any secrets?

1882
03:07:02,250 --> 03:07:09,000
Any secrets?

1883
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:26,010
secrets secret

1884
03:07:26,010 --> 03:07:27,930
Any secrets over here secret?

1885
03:07:27,930 --> 03:08:02,020
Okay, never mind

1886
03:08:06,889 --> 03:08:07,610
uh

1887
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:14,170
Okay

1888
03:08:14,170 --> 03:08:16,170
La pd give yourself up

1889
03:08:25,340 --> 03:08:29,020
Like i don't know if he's in apparently apparently you are in here somewhere

1890
03:08:29,739 --> 03:08:44,579
Come on in even the bedroom. Where the hell is this guy?

1891
03:08:45,379 --> 03:08:59,450
Okay, is he just hiding in here?

1892
03:09:00,010 --> 03:09:04,629
I mean, there's a door. I couldn't open this door. Could I open this? All right, I can open this one

1893
03:09:07,430 --> 03:09:09,270
Wait, jesus

1894
03:09:09,270 --> 03:09:13,620
You realize this must have been the place rusty

1895
03:09:14,889 --> 03:09:16,569
This is where he did it all

1896
03:09:16,569 --> 03:09:25,819
It's fucked up

1897
03:09:25,819 --> 03:09:27,819
It's the basis for all his riddles

1898
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:34,700
Prometheus defied the cruel gods this guy's the basest from that. That's what I thought he said. It was the basis

1899
03:09:37,799 --> 03:09:39,799
Wow, that is kind of like a basest pose, isn't it?

1900
03:09:41,159 --> 03:09:49,219
I'm really gonna need to try this guy or

1901
03:09:50,260 --> 03:09:57,049
This is evidence, right?

1902
03:09:57,049 --> 03:09:58,700
kind of need to

1903
03:09:58,700 --> 03:09:59,899
Look at it

1904
03:09:59,899 --> 03:10:08,010
Had a cool experience baby, at least some working knowledge of biology

1905
03:10:08,889 --> 03:10:11,129
He's cruel and he's methodical

1906
03:10:12,219 --> 03:10:13,579
Anything else

1907
03:10:13,579 --> 03:10:17,590
I don't think so

1908
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:26,540
Well, we're going down there kill garrick mason

1909
03:10:27,260 --> 03:10:32,520
I'll go so not even back up and keep an eye out above ground and see capture

1910
03:10:35,159 --> 03:10:37,159
Kill oh there he is

1911
03:10:38,360 --> 03:10:40,360
You're an interesting man

1912
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:45,600
Reinforcements are on the

1913
03:10:46,329 --> 03:10:48,329
Why is he holding the gun like that?

1914
03:10:50,459 --> 03:10:53,260
Do I get a sense you're looking for personal redemption

1915
03:10:56,379 --> 03:10:58,379
He got the hat

1916
03:11:00,540 --> 03:11:02,540
All right, just fuck this man

1917
03:11:08,729 --> 03:11:10,649
Go put him in the bathtub

1918
03:11:10,649 --> 03:11:16,819
Where's the press gap?

1919
03:11:16,819 --> 03:11:20,659
I think felps and I should get a medal for this. So this has got to be the case of the year, right?

1920
03:11:21,219 --> 03:11:24,040
The case of the century when you think about it you finished

1921
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Yes skipper good

1922
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:31,739
Because there won't be any press briefings all accommodations. It was my son

1923
03:11:31,739 --> 03:11:33,659
What are you talking about?

1924
03:11:33,659 --> 03:11:38,780
We got the werewolf the guy who killed the dahlia killed all the other broads. You've got no one

1925
03:11:39,579 --> 03:11:42,379
Mason was a ghost and you at least tell us why captain

1926
03:11:44,379 --> 03:11:49,579
Mason is the half brother of one of the most highly elected officials in this country. Oh this is true

1927
03:11:51,959 --> 03:11:54,440
Beyond the moon for mere mortals like us rusty

1928
03:11:55,319 --> 03:12:00,500
We no more mention of them the senator knows you both half brother

1929
03:12:00,579 --> 03:12:04,739
There'll be no mileage and never bringing this up again what's going to happen to the suspects in the cases captain

1930
03:12:04,979 --> 03:12:07,930
I won't be a part of that

1931
03:12:07,930 --> 03:12:09,930
A bit of missing evidence at the grand jury

1932
03:12:10,979 --> 03:12:13,299
Procedural error here a mistake there

1933
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:16,229
They'd all be quietly let go

1934
03:12:17,299 --> 03:12:20,069
The da knows how we have to play it. That's it

1935
03:12:21,030 --> 03:12:23,030
I'm afraid it is

1936
03:12:23,799 --> 03:12:25,799
And I have some news for you folks

1937
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:29,959
No more rooting around in the entrails of cadavers and corpses for you

1938
03:12:30,899 --> 03:12:32,899
The head of vice has asked the chief

1939
03:12:33,540 --> 03:12:42,200
Reluctant to see you go to the glory boys about go home to that lovely wife

1940
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:44,200
the real

1941
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:46,200
Villain was politics

1942
03:12:55,219 --> 03:13:00,969
Apparently the simple art of murder case report 15 out of 15

1943
03:13:01,930 --> 03:13:14,860
Who is injured remains open the truth lost to all but a handful of men prepare for reassignment

1944
03:13:23,079 --> 03:13:25,079
Reval kid you'll go purple

1945
03:13:25,719 --> 03:13:28,280
I'm scared sarge everybody scared kid

1946
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:30,840
Anyone who says he isn't is a damn liar

1947
03:13:31,879 --> 03:13:33,879
How many times have you been in combat sarge?

1948
03:13:34,120 --> 03:13:38,040
I was with raider battalion on pelaloo my first time was it bad

1949
03:13:38,760 --> 03:13:41,000
It's always bad. Will this be bad?

1950
03:13:41,719 --> 03:13:46,040
As bad as it gets kid. It's bad. It's always bad

1951
03:13:47,639 --> 03:13:50,280
So some of the guys they aren't very friendly sarge

1952
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:53,319
They've lost a lot of their friends in the last couple of days kid

1953
03:13:53,479 --> 03:13:57,079
I think if they don't get to know you that they won't have to grieve for you if you get killed

1954
03:13:57,479 --> 03:14:02,920
They're wrong. It doesn't work that way. Don't worry. No marine in this company will let you down

1955
03:14:03,959 --> 03:14:12,180
Okay

03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:14,329

So you're working with the big boys now col I guess so, right? I thought homicide was the primo assignment

What's going on here? We dropped a couple frames

Looks like it detective phelps. I got the call for assistance. Who are the suspects bank robbers?

2001
03:18:51,450 --> 03:18:54,649
Same gang that took the citizens national trust and savings last month

03:19:22,860 --> 03:19:24,860
How long you think you can hold out

2004
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:45,129

That's it

2010
03:20:23,190 --> 03:20:25,670

Crime scene, what are you doing? What did I hit?

03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:12,680
About 50 bucks for an exclusive

up here

2031
03:22:30,360 --> 03:22:32,360
You're coming from a crime scene

2032
03:22:32,620 --> 03:22:34,059
Your show now

2033
03:22:34,059 --> 03:22:38,809
You said up the stair. I'm just looking around. I'm just looking around

2034
03:22:39,209 --> 03:22:41,209
Jesus

2035
03:22:41,209 --> 03:22:42,649
What have we got

2036
03:22:42,649 --> 03:22:44,649
two stiffs overdosed

2037
03:22:44,729 --> 03:22:50,090
Been dead a couple of days government issue morphine. We use the same syrettes in okinawa

2038
03:22:50,809 --> 03:22:54,649
Fucking negro junkies can't take supply this pure. You know these guys

2039
03:22:55,450 --> 03:22:56,809
I know of them

2040
03:22:56,809 --> 03:23:02,350
The younger one's a two-bit horn player by the name of cornell tyree. The other one works in distribution

2041
03:23:02,889 --> 03:23:06,569
Started using a little too much of his own product and jack d took exception

2042
03:23:07,290 --> 03:23:10,090
He wasn't born that ugly his name's lamont

2043
03:23:10,969 --> 03:23:15,290
Tyrone lamont, I don't like this guy's tie. You know who's supplying the drugs

2044
03:23:15,930 --> 03:23:19,049
That's easy whoever knocked off the wharves in san pedro

2045
03:23:19,770 --> 03:23:25,610
Jack dragnet mickey cohen dopes been all upside down ever since jimmy utley started the long walk at quentin

2046
03:23:26,489 --> 03:23:28,649
This guy sucks and he's wearing like

2047
03:23:29,530 --> 03:23:31,530
like tampon tie

2048
03:23:31,930 --> 03:23:35,290
We are supposed to uphold the law the hell is this tie? Yeah, and we do

2049
03:23:35,770 --> 03:23:37,770
But we can't change people

2050
03:23:38,809 --> 03:23:42,649
The truth is everyone wants a license to get a little dirty now and then

2051
03:23:43,370 --> 03:23:46,090
Our job is to keep it manageable. That's how you see it

2052
03:23:47,209 --> 03:23:49,209
Contact lens cases

2053
03:23:51,209 --> 03:23:53,469
Can we get on with this today preferably

2054
03:23:54,489 --> 03:24:01,780
So we got a wallet

2055
03:24:01,780 --> 03:24:04,920
Let's actually do a look at this stuff

2056
03:24:05,079 --> 03:24:07,879
Knock you off for combat trauma two of them will stop your heart

2057
03:24:08,440 --> 03:24:11,690
Is

2058
03:24:11,770 --> 03:24:20,540
Say only the good die young. I hope it was true in your case

2059
03:24:24,340 --> 03:24:25,459
Interesting

2060
03:24:25,459 --> 03:24:36,540
Do you have anything else?

2061
03:24:38,469 --> 03:24:40,469
another wallet

2062
03:24:41,190 --> 03:24:53,299
Another day another dollar must have been messy eaters. It's all over the floor

2063
03:24:54,819 --> 03:25:00,520
Tyrone lamont, not even 23 years old. You always check the wallets first

2064
03:25:01,799 --> 03:25:07,030
A small chance in life is probably better than no chance

2065
03:25:07,989 --> 03:25:23,690
So wallet on ground wallet on guy find anything interesting sheet music

2066
03:25:24,969 --> 03:25:33,260
I wonder what's the correlation between the love of the needle and love of the music

2067
03:25:47,420 --> 03:25:50,379
It's some kind of fruit a bell. It's a slot machine

2068
03:25:51,659 --> 03:25:56,139
strange doodle

2069
03:26:01,270 --> 03:26:14,649
People are yelling at me who is jj. Why do these two care about his taste in music?

2070
03:26:15,610 --> 03:26:40,780
He listens to 275 fm anything else let's find anything interesting looks like it was always going to end this way

2071
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:54,090
Never the same are they now?

2072
03:26:55,450 --> 03:27:03,750
Okay, did I pick up this?

2073
03:27:06,229 --> 03:27:11,909
He's on the oh it's popcorn black caesar from the joint across the street

2074
03:27:12,629 --> 03:27:29,139
It's like something was taped to the bottom of the cup that's really weird looking popcorn it's almost like a

2075
03:27:30,500 --> 03:27:31,940
keyed in

2076
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:43,530
Took his jolt and drifted off and I suppose his friend wasn't in any condition to notice that he had stopped breathing

2077
03:27:44,170 --> 03:27:52,629
what else

2078
03:27:52,629 --> 03:27:55,530
superglue

2079
03:27:55,530 --> 03:27:57,370
Street life have no idea morphine

2080
03:28:05,180 --> 03:28:07,420
Another special order from the caesar

2081
03:28:11,639 --> 03:28:13,639
This one last piece here

2082
03:28:13,799 --> 03:28:19,670
No cooking or preparation must have been the easiest fix these two ever had

2083
03:28:24,219 --> 03:28:26,709
kitchen bread

2084
03:28:29,670 --> 03:28:32,920
Heavy for an empty cup something in this one

2085
03:28:34,409 --> 03:28:37,610
Well, they've been getting their fix right over the counter and broad there it is

Morphing might not be filling but i'm sure it's satisfying there it is

I'll do my best. Mr. Chad is the second mind

Yeah, I just need to look over here and see like the word and I go

But you have morphine. We know that you supplied inside of your boxes by no drugs

2145

All I do is my tan hair flipping burgers. Can you prove any different?

I can wait into that. Okay, if that was in the apartment here it is

2148

Flipping burgers and strapping jolts of morphine to the bottom of popcorn cups fleetwood

Dogs go crazy for that shit

2199
03:41:12,569 --> 03:41:14,569

03:41:15,450 --> 03:41:22,959

2210
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:04,520
That's the only reason why I watch

2211
03:42:05,159 --> 03:42:08,239
Well, i'm glad you're here watching

2212
03:42:11,260 --> 03:42:13,500

I run a strictly legitimate bookmakers detective

2215
03:42:19,549 --> 03:42:24,829
So that's not an illegal wire service that your colleagues are running and the number slips that i've been picking up all morning

2216
03:42:24,829 --> 03:42:31,149

2217
03:42:31,709 --> 03:42:35,549
You can't go shaking me down. You're a loudmouth motherfucker. Aren't you?

2218
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:39,149
Anyone ever tell you the criminals are supposed to keep their mouths shut

2219
03:42:40,110 --> 03:42:42,110
Stay where you are while we look around

2220
03:42:43,149 --> 03:42:55,610
Okay

2221
03:42:55,610 --> 03:42:56,969

2222
03:42:56,969 --> 03:42:58,879

baseball

2228
03:43:15,370 --> 03:43:24,159
incidental

2229
03:43:24,159 --> 03:43:25,920
lamp record player

2230
03:43:25,920 --> 03:43:31,680

03:43:34,010 --> 03:43:36,010
Boost paper we got telephones

03:43:40,219 --> 03:43:43,659
Why so many going took over the wire service from seagull, right?

2233
03:43:58,040 --> 03:44:08,010
Slop machine he's held this like the button and pressed to hold a symbol

2234
03:44:09,719 --> 03:44:16,959
Oh, hold on. Where is that thing?

03:44:22,159 --> 03:44:24,079

Cherry bell

2241
03:44:50,299 --> 03:44:58,329
You can't do this on slot machines. You can't hold a symbol forever

2242
03:45:10,540 --> 03:45:12,540
And here's all the morphine

2243
03:45:17,870 --> 03:45:23,799
This quantity we're looking at a high level trafficking charge. There's a lot in here

2244
03:45:24,829 --> 03:45:26,510
And we got tickets

2245
03:45:26,510 --> 03:45:39,319
Thanks for the paper trail merlin free morphine. That's what you win. Oh, that's quite a win for a dime merlin

2246
03:45:39,399 --> 03:45:42,440
You better start talking. Get after him felts

2247
03:45:43,079 --> 03:45:45,079
Chase give it up. Adi

2248
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:59,719
Go after him felps

2249
03:45:59,879 --> 03:46:01,719
Okay

2250
03:46:01,719 --> 03:46:06,909
Who did that?

2251
03:46:06,909 --> 03:46:09,709
What this is a secure area. You all need to leave

2252
03:46:13,930 --> 03:46:15,930
How do I stop him

2253
03:46:16,489 --> 03:46:19,370
All right, all right relax motherfucker. You got me

2254
03:46:20,809 --> 03:46:24,649
He ran into somebody too bad. You couldn't pull off your vanishing act

2255
03:46:25,770 --> 03:46:30,250
Make your joke smart guy, but don't damage that. Oh my god. There's a valuable antique

2256
03:46:30,569 --> 03:46:32,569
You don't say

2257
03:46:33,850 --> 03:46:35,850
Maybe you ought to have a look at this cold

2258
03:46:41,469 --> 03:46:44,829
Okay, let's look at look at the what is this a this is a

2259
03:46:45,870 --> 03:46:47,870
What is it? What is it? What does it say? What is this?

2260
03:46:50,649 --> 03:46:55,319
Duck stir. Oh, he has jose rames in his pocket

2261
03:46:56,120 --> 03:46:59,000
Ramos must have forgotten his lucky dollars in no sense

2262
03:47:00,040 --> 03:47:10,729
I think that's it. Would you like to calculate the odds on you going to prison for a very long time merlin?

2263
03:47:11,610 --> 03:47:16,090
I'm not going nowhere. I've paid my contributions and i'm not getting hustled by you

2264
03:47:16,569 --> 03:47:24,350
We're only interested in morphine army surplus morphine. What do you have to say about that? I heard about that

2265
03:47:24,989 --> 03:47:27,079
Big robbery on the ship

2266
03:47:27,079 --> 03:47:30,920
Ain't my line of work. I prefer something with a sporting outcome

2267
03:47:33,549 --> 03:47:34,510
Lie

2268
03:47:34,510 --> 03:47:45,049
Okay, merlin behave like a moron the two dead guys. I'm telling the da that you sold them the hop

2269
03:47:45,610 --> 03:47:48,649
Are you hearing this?

2270
03:47:48,729 --> 03:47:53,870
And clear motherfucker I have chips and i'm not throwing my cards in this easy

2271
03:47:57,709 --> 03:48:00,909
Rames seems to owe you a lot of money. We all owe somebody

2272
03:48:01,469 --> 03:48:13,000
That's it

2273
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:15,719
Okay, so it has nothing to do with the proceeds of the morphine shipment

2274
03:48:16,649 --> 03:48:18,329
It's a gambling debt

2275
03:48:18,329 --> 03:48:23,930
The heaps took over the wise service and screwed me now. I just do what i'm told run numbers and ship dope

2276
03:48:24,569 --> 03:48:26,329
Jose's no different

2277
03:48:26,329 --> 03:48:28,569
He just thinks he's a big man that can run up tabs

2278
03:48:29,209 --> 03:48:36,620
You're not the guy we want merlin we're taking you in maybe some time. He wasn't telling the truth before something worthwhile

2279
03:48:37,260 --> 03:48:38,540
Fuck you

2280
03:48:38,540 --> 03:48:40,139
And fuck you

2281
03:48:40,139 --> 03:48:44,170
You'll never put a charge on me

2282
03:48:44,170 --> 03:48:47,129
Take this bum in I was just gonna make the joke

2283
03:48:47,770 --> 03:48:50,010
Don't be gentle with him. I can't got that

2284
03:48:51,049 --> 03:48:54,250
I was just gonna make that joke about how like oh and then it cuts to him in a squad car

2285
03:48:54,250 --> 03:48:56,250
I didn't make it because I made it already

2286
03:48:58,190 --> 03:49:02,409
I almost wish I said it now

2287
03:49:02,409 --> 03:49:04,409
That's unfortunate. I was gonna say it

2288
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:17,479
Mickey cohen runs the dope rack always sonny theme plays

2289
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:20,040
All right, Mickey does what he's told

2290
03:49:20,440 --> 03:49:26,000
Benny siegel will take a cover his operation going. I thought jack dragnet was

2291
03:49:26,959 --> 03:49:30,719
Dragging is an old-time greaser. He keeps his head down and pays his dues

2292
03:49:31,200 --> 03:49:33,200
Word is he's gonna clip bugsy

2293
03:49:34,079 --> 03:49:35,760
Who's word?

2294
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:40,360
Does it matter one low life killing another low life makes our job easier?

2295
03:49:41,479 --> 03:49:56,649
I'm just gonna go here

2296
03:50:00,479 --> 03:50:03,760
I already arrested the guy you can't do anything on maybe

2297
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:10,729
Sounds like me singing

2298
03:50:10,729 --> 03:50:17,760
Don't take notes while you drive. That's true. You shouldn't do anything like that

2299
03:50:28,030 --> 03:50:30,030
Thank god, we're not in my car

2300
03:50:31,899 --> 03:50:36,379
Well, that's because I destroyed your car in front of you and I've burnt it so

2301
03:50:37,819 --> 03:50:40,059
I don't know what you mean by that exactly

2302
03:50:41,399 --> 03:50:43,399
god damn maniac

2303
03:50:43,479 --> 03:50:54,030
Is there a penalty for running people over there's a penalty for doing any damage at all

2304
03:50:55,790 --> 03:50:59,309
Bumping into cars hitting anybody you get a monetary penalty

2305
03:50:59,950 --> 03:51:01,950
every single fender bender

2306
03:51:02,350 --> 03:51:11,399
I thought it was this store. I thought it was that store and we were gonna get a cut scene quite enough. I thought

2307
03:51:12,200 --> 03:51:15,209
wrong

2308
03:51:15,209 --> 03:51:19,530
You use money. I know I do not believe so at least not at this point not that I can tell

2309
03:51:25,690 --> 03:51:27,549
Look at this place

2310
03:51:27,549 --> 03:51:30,829
I'm guessing not much talent comes out of this talent agency

2311
03:51:30,909 --> 03:51:32,110
Right

2312
03:51:32,110 --> 03:51:46,620

So we got fm

Now we have to tune it. How's volume?

03:58:40,409 --> 03:58:42,409
It's just one of those tech demos

2388
03:58:46,360 --> 03:58:50,280
So when we visit ram as removals and tell them that we want a special

They all have the same briefcase

2406
04:00:26,299 --> 04:00:40,520
So mickey cohen or jack dragnus stole the army surplus morphine and they are selling it on the streets

But where does it get us?

2415
04:01:07,079 --> 04:01:12,250
It's like asking questions in the middle of the movie. You just sit tight and keep your yap shut

2416
04:01:12,729 --> 04:01:14,729
We'll find out what happens. Okay

04:04:03,600 --> 04:04:05,600
Is this gonna be a furniture maze?

2446

No, i'm so happy to do the furniture maze. Where's that trail of water coming from colt?

2448
04:04:16,059 --> 04:04:21,500
There must be a way through the back

2449
04:04:21,819 --> 04:04:27,639
What would you do with all this stuff?

2450
04:04:27,719 --> 04:04:30,840
Welcome to furniture village where taste comes to die

2452
04:04:38,350 --> 04:04:40,510
What a pile of junk

2453
04:04:40,510 --> 04:04:42,510
My mother would be in heaven

2454
04:04:42,590 --> 04:04:44,590
Well, the water is here

2455
04:04:48,940 --> 04:04:53,180
I bet this is the kind of crap you love col 20 years out of fashion

2456
04:04:54,219 --> 04:04:57,040
Wait, am I crazy?

2457
04:04:57,200 --> 04:05:13,440
That was where the water was leaving people in here. Is there water on the ground over here?

2458
04:05:19,719 --> 04:05:26,620

2462
04:05:46,430 --> 04:06:01,049
Following water

2463
04:06:01,049 --> 04:06:03,159
What happened to the water?

2464
04:06:03,159 --> 04:06:04,200
There it is

2465
04:06:04,200 --> 04:06:12,840
Is there water over here? There is not this water this way

2466
04:06:13,479 --> 04:06:18,459
This is where I ended up before

2467
04:06:18,459 --> 04:06:23,180
Time to check jose's books. See where he makes his delivery runs. Try the front desk

2468
04:06:23,979 --> 04:06:31,629
So the water just stops right here. So what the hell do I do?

2469
04:06:32,590 --> 04:06:35,549
See where he makes his delivery runs. Try the front desk

2470
04:06:36,350 --> 04:06:45,659
Time to check jose's books. See where he makes his delivery runs. Try the front desk

2471
04:06:49,610 --> 04:06:54,409
Hold on a second. Are you are you telling me that to just go to the very beginning?

2472
04:06:55,690 --> 04:06:57,690
Try the front desk

2473
04:06:58,459 --> 04:07:01,659
So there was no reason for me to go and follow the water trail to there

2474
04:07:02,459 --> 04:07:04,780
Is that what you're saying?

2475
04:07:04,780 --> 04:07:28,889
I'm fucking serious

2476
04:07:34,250 --> 04:07:44,780
Okay, uh, so I need to find what am I looking for do I have like a

Well, here's the rest of this

2482
04:08:44,729 --> 04:09:21,069
Can you think anywhere else to meet kid? We like to choose our ground. What is that supposed to mean?

2483
04:09:21,709 --> 04:09:26,430
It's something wellington said at waterloo the guys who win normally choose where to fight. We're gonna fight kid

2484
04:09:27,149 --> 04:09:29,149
The two of you versus my boys here

2485
04:09:29,629 --> 04:09:31,790
I love the fight game. I went a few rounds myself

2486
04:09:32,750 --> 04:09:34,350
You and your friend

2487
04:09:34,350 --> 04:09:40,190
It looks tough, but uh, I don't like your chances. Nah, we don't have to fight. Mr. Cohen

2488
04:09:40,829 --> 04:09:44,430
We have you an inflate. What the fuck is that some kind of steak?

2489
04:09:46,110 --> 04:09:49,069
It means my men are in cover, but that they can still shoot you

2490
04:09:52,829 --> 04:09:58,350
If those were my orders, you would all be dead now. Are you kidding me on purpose? This is a $200 coat

2491
04:09:59,229 --> 04:10:01,229
You got some balls. So

2492
04:10:01,469 --> 04:10:03,799
I hope you didn't scratch the pain in my new lincoln

2493
04:10:05,760 --> 04:10:09,920
These guys are getting out of the dope business. Mr. Cohen. You'll have no more problems from them

2494
04:10:10,799 --> 04:10:16,639
The morphine is going to disappear back into the sea. Hang on you're getting hasty

2495
04:10:17,360 --> 04:10:19,840
There's a lot of dough on offer here. Thanks for the offer. Mr

2496
04:10:19,840 --> 04:10:24,239
Cohen, but we are going to have to politely decline after today. The morphine is no more

2497
04:10:24,239 --> 04:10:28,719
This isn't the way we normally do business. I'm aware of that. Mr. Cohen call me mickey

2498
04:10:29,850 --> 04:10:35,610
Are you aware of the risk? Huh? I'm giving it to you straight. Mr. Cohen. There will be no more morphine

2499
04:10:36,409 --> 04:10:39,850
We made a mistake you would like to back out gracefully if you come after us

2500
04:10:40,090 --> 04:10:42,889
We will be forced to come after you. You've been polite up till now

2501
04:10:43,370 --> 04:10:46,569
So don't start making money. I don't make threats. Mr. Cohen

2502
04:10:49,450 --> 04:10:52,409
I'd like to thank you for your time after this cut scene. I will

2503
04:10:53,370 --> 04:10:55,370
Graciously take a look

2504
04:10:56,489 --> 04:10:58,729
There's something you should know about jack. Mr. Cohen

2505
04:10:59,950 --> 04:11:03,870
He killed six jabs hand to hand with just a bayonet and a k-bar knife

2506
04:11:04,750 --> 04:11:11,309
His outfit the six marines killed over a hundred thousand jabs in three months in okinawa and he was in the thick of it

2507
04:11:11,950 --> 04:11:13,950
Those japs are little guys, right?

2508
04:11:14,590 --> 04:11:16,510
Yes, mr. Cohen

2509
04:11:16,510 --> 04:11:32,409
about your size

2510
04:11:32,409 --> 04:11:43,260
All right

2511
04:11:43,260 --> 04:11:45,260
We're loading. Oh

2512
04:11:45,260 --> 04:11:55,610
Okay

2513
04:11:55,610 --> 04:12:00,430
newspapers

2514
04:12:00,430 --> 04:12:02,430
All right, you know, we need to do anything else here

2515
04:12:06,909 --> 04:12:08,829
Any more red dead redemption?

2516
04:12:08,829 --> 04:12:11,790
Yes, i'll probably be playing that again after this

2517
04:12:12,750 --> 04:12:16,190
This is the second la demar stream

2518
04:12:18,799 --> 04:12:24,079
But let me get to the cookie crm gave 50 dollars

2519
04:12:24,879 --> 04:12:27,840
Thank you so much for the 50 bucks cookie

2520
04:12:29,149 --> 04:12:32,829
And cookie says hey there germa, it's been a rough tough few months for me

2521
04:12:32,909 --> 04:12:35,790
So it's nice to come and watch the stream. My crappy time got better

2522
04:12:36,350 --> 04:12:40,190
Got the better of me and I kind of acted like a jerk on your last stream in boston

2523
04:12:40,959 --> 04:12:46,559
I made a few jokes about how your stream sucks after donating 115 dollars, but I don't think the joke went through well

2524
04:12:47,440 --> 04:12:51,280
I've felt awful about it ever since so here's some more money to go with my apology

2525
04:12:51,360 --> 04:12:55,920
Even if you feel it's not needed to enjoy a gift to kickstart your gambling addiction

2526
04:12:59,290 --> 04:13:01,979
Uh, I don't I don't remember

2527
04:13:02,219 --> 04:13:04,940
I don't remember any

2528
04:13:04,940 --> 04:13:12,139
Mean comments or anything but thank you for the 50 dollars here cookie

2529
04:13:13,639 --> 04:13:15,639
Sorry to hear about your um

2530
04:13:16,219 --> 04:13:18,059
That you're having a tough time

2531
04:13:18,059 --> 04:13:20,219
Hope it's better now. Hope you're having a better time

2532
04:13:25,530 --> 04:13:27,530
You were crying

2533
04:13:32,280 --> 04:13:34,280
I was really drinking

2534
04:13:34,280 --> 04:13:36,280
I was drinking heavily that stream

2535
04:13:36,360 --> 04:13:40,799
but anyways

2536
04:13:40,799 --> 04:13:46,399
Uh, thank you so much, dude. Don't worry about it. I don't really know. I don't really remember

2537
04:13:47,200 --> 04:13:53,149
But it's all good. All right. Is there anything else I need to do in here?

2538
04:13:59,440 --> 04:14:01,440
I clicked on this because somebody said it

2539
04:14:01,680 --> 04:14:10,120
Well, an audio is buying a lot of furniture

2540
04:14:13,840 --> 04:14:15,840
Stream sucks, by the way

2541
04:14:17,180 --> 04:14:18,299
well

2542
04:14:18,299 --> 04:14:24,159
That's your opinion. I'm glad you have one

2543
04:14:31,479 --> 04:14:35,850
It'd be bad if you didn't

2544
04:14:35,850 --> 04:14:41,319
All right. Now follow trail of water. There's a trail of water here

2545
04:14:42,040 --> 04:15:09,899
Drink the water

2546
04:15:09,899 --> 04:15:11,500
This is useless

2547
04:15:11,500 --> 04:15:13,500
I can't see a damn door or ladder

2548
04:15:14,059 --> 04:15:16,059
You need to get up onto the floor of water

2549
04:15:16,540 --> 04:15:30,030
All right, uh

2550
04:15:30,030 --> 04:15:34,909
Phillips, I think it's time for you to join the american ninja warrior crew. Holy shit

2551
04:15:45,149 --> 04:15:46,110
buttons

2552
04:15:46,110 --> 04:16:01,840
What is this for?

2553
04:16:13,959 --> 04:16:15,959
Grab the guy

2554
04:16:16,440 --> 04:16:18,440
Can you can I like pick him up?

2555
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:28,079
Crush him crush him

2556
04:16:32,620 --> 04:16:34,139
Ah

2557
04:16:34,139 --> 04:16:37,370
Wait, did I just block myself and dad's let him in?

2558
04:16:38,010 --> 04:16:49,479
I think I have to pick that up again and move it. He's right there. I tried

2559
04:17:03,239 --> 04:17:06,139
Block the door again

2560
04:17:06,139 --> 04:17:12,729
All right. What do you uh

2561
04:17:13,790 --> 04:17:15,790
some kind of shortcut

2562
04:17:19,209 --> 04:17:20,350
or

2563
04:17:20,350 --> 04:17:22,440
What?

2564
04:17:22,440 --> 04:17:35,040
Now block him in

2565
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:37,979
No, i'm not jumping

2566
04:17:37,979 --> 04:17:39,979
I'm not i'm not restarting this mission

2567
04:17:42,639 --> 04:17:46,700
I think we know where the water's coming from. You're gonna want to see this

2568
04:17:47,739 --> 04:17:52,440
Yep

2569
04:17:52,440 --> 04:17:57,559
Uh, I think frozen inside. No, i'm not gonna make it and what I was gonna say was a mosquito or like a jurassic park

2570
04:17:57,879 --> 04:17:59,879
Fucking fossil whatever

2571
04:18:00,360 --> 04:18:18,719
Uh, okay. I'll be damned

2572
04:18:22,270 --> 04:18:26,969
Giant jenga. I've played this at a bar before this must be how they transport them

2573
04:18:50,090 --> 04:18:53,290
Leave it right there everyone out of the vehicle and put your hands up

2574
04:18:54,520 --> 04:18:56,520
There's something in the ice

2575
04:18:56,760 --> 04:18:59,559
He's making a run for it. There's something in the ice

2576
04:19:01,920 --> 04:19:02,879
Oh

2577
04:19:02,879 --> 04:19:04,159
Get him

2578
04:19:04,159 --> 04:19:07,360
No, don't lose me in the furniture maze. I'm wide open here fuck

2579
04:19:08,239 --> 04:19:09,680
Oh, no

2580
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:26,440
He's dead

2581
04:19:26,440 --> 04:19:28,440
I think no he's good

2582
04:19:29,850 --> 04:19:33,530
Take them all to hollywood station have the me and tech services go over this place

2583
04:19:34,670 --> 04:19:41,549
What will you be hunting polar bear polar golf polar bear ice golf?

2584
04:19:42,350 --> 04:19:49,239
Is otty serious is the lappd turning a blind eye to narcotics

2585
04:19:50,120 --> 04:19:53,129
Keep your shirt on felps

2586
04:19:53,680 --> 04:19:56,639
Drugs are prohibited doesn't mean people don't want to take them

2587
04:19:57,520 --> 04:20:00,079
Limiting supply doesn't mean that we have limited demand

2588
04:20:01,819 --> 04:20:06,059
I understand that I know that the average joe needs to unwind my plans on the switch

2589
04:20:06,940 --> 04:20:08,860
Is this this is orphan switch heroin?

2590
04:20:10,760 --> 04:20:13,879
It's important to demonize hop phelps. It looks good in the papers

2591
04:20:14,440 --> 04:20:17,239
But when all is said and done, it's just another chemical like booze

2592
04:20:18,040 --> 04:20:23,239
A lot of people in high places think we're doing the city a favor by keeping the dope rolling into central avenue

2593
04:20:23,959 --> 04:20:26,620
Donnelly certainly believes we need to keep them anesthetized

2594
04:20:28,520 --> 04:20:30,920
Better jobs and opportunities would go a lot further

2595
04:20:32,600 --> 04:20:34,600
Will you listen to yourself

2596
04:20:41,450 --> 04:20:42,649
No

2597
04:20:42,649 --> 04:20:50,000
I don't think so

2598
04:20:50,000 --> 04:21:08,110
Landmark. Oh, that's right. This is his car

2599
04:21:08,909 --> 04:21:19,389
Must have gotten fixed. I missed a turn audit

2600
04:21:25,340 --> 04:21:27,500
You're paying for every last scratch

2601
04:21:28,700 --> 04:21:39,180
For years

2602
04:21:39,180 --> 04:21:45,500
Not much call for ice anymore with all those newfangled refrigerators save it for someone who wants to hear it

2603
04:21:46,139 --> 04:21:48,139
How many janitors carry a gap?

2604
04:21:56,200 --> 04:22:01,399
Give it up finkelstein your brother-in-law will get you a good lawyer. My brother-in-law hates my guts

2605
04:22:02,040 --> 04:22:04,760
Come and get me if you want some daylight for that suit of yours

2606
04:22:06,040 --> 04:22:08,040
Well, that's three

2607
04:22:08,120 --> 04:22:22,079
I'm trying to just get him really quickly

2608
04:22:33,159 --> 04:22:35,159
Damn it

2609
04:22:45,360 --> 04:22:55,100
What don't do it again don't do it again throw out the guns

2610
04:22:59,020 --> 04:23:07,530
I didn't hit him at all. I didn't hit him in the face. Oh, you had a spark head there

2611
04:23:08,409 --> 04:23:17,479
Here easy

2612
04:23:25,760 --> 04:23:38,360
Push forward pick up what like my god

2613
04:23:39,399 --> 04:23:41,399
What is this like?

2614
04:23:43,399 --> 04:23:45,149
I'm gonna say

2615
04:23:45,149 --> 04:23:55,209
All dead finkelstein leave the weapon and put your hands up now

2616
04:23:56,299 --> 04:24:00,059
Put my hands up it says press x to pick up weapon

2617
04:24:00,780 --> 04:24:06,459
But it doesn't actually mean it you have to be standing on the weapon some old friend puts a an ice pick above my ear

2618
04:24:06,780 --> 04:24:09,579
No, thanks only one other way out shit heel

2619
04:24:12,299 --> 04:24:19,719
Let's have a look around now that we finally got some peace and quiet

2620
04:24:22,840 --> 04:24:24,840
I think i've had enough ice for one day

2621
04:24:25,719 --> 04:24:28,680
Until the scotch I pour myself as soon as we get out of here

2622
04:24:30,620 --> 04:24:35,500
Three guess is what's in the box open her up col. It's gonna be drugs

2623
04:24:35,979 --> 04:24:40,139
Yeah, there it is. This stuff has got to be worth at least a hundred grand

2624
04:24:41,180 --> 04:24:43,180
So finkelstein robbed the ship

2625
04:24:44,459 --> 04:24:46,540
My guess is lenny took it off their hands

2626
04:24:47,340 --> 04:24:49,549
This is big

2627
04:24:49,549 --> 04:24:51,549
This is going to make the papers felps

2628
04:24:51,870 --> 04:24:53,870
As senior investigator i'll do the talking

2629
04:24:54,510 --> 04:25:05,450
biggest drug bust ever

2630
04:25:05,450 --> 04:25:11,610
Well, well who would have thought that roy earl's hand-picked new partner would have turned out to be such a great case, man

2631
04:25:12,649 --> 04:25:16,010
This is a good result felps as far as we can tell lenny

2632
04:25:16,010 --> 04:25:19,850
The fink was moving the morphine across the city and as far north as frisco

2633
04:25:20,409 --> 04:25:24,489
This makes the feds very happy and it makes mickey cohen look bad

2634
04:25:25,209 --> 04:25:27,479
Don't lie to you kid

2635
04:25:27,479 --> 04:25:29,319
I like the headlines

2636
04:25:29,319 --> 04:25:31,319
I like them a lot

2637
04:25:31,799 --> 04:25:36,200
You keep this squad in the papers and we'll get along just fine

2638
04:25:37,639 --> 04:25:52,030
I did it case report

2639
04:25:53,309 --> 04:25:55,549
Not that great, but not it's very

2640
04:26:00,270 --> 04:26:04,750
The death of lenny finkelstein should keep administrative vice in the headlines for now

2641
04:26:20,110 --> 04:26:22,110
You know a freddy calhoun

2642
04:26:22,829 --> 04:26:25,790
Sure, I know freddy needs money to get out of town

2643
04:26:26,590 --> 04:26:31,229
Says he's prepared to blow i'm not looking at it. It's a wild tangent distribution ring

2644
04:26:31,870 --> 04:26:38,989
Says he said how much it's gonna cost 50 bucks and the department will front me the 50 you can put in an expense claim

2645
04:26:39,870 --> 04:26:43,149
He's over at mike lineman's on hollywood boulevard. See what you can find out

2646
04:26:49,950 --> 04:26:51,950
All right. Um I

2647
04:26:53,500 --> 04:26:57,760
Unfortunately looking at my phone a couple of times here. I have to make a few phone calls

2648
04:27:00,120 --> 04:27:02,510
About important matters

2649
04:27:07,209 --> 04:27:09,209
I need to make two phone calls

2650
04:27:11,149 --> 04:27:13,149
So I have to go

2651
04:27:14,649 --> 04:27:15,530
uh

2652
04:27:15,530 --> 04:27:17,450
Don't worry. Everything's fine. It's just about

2653
04:27:18,409 --> 04:27:20,329
a couple of

2654
04:27:20,329 --> 04:27:27,040
loose ends that need time

2655
04:27:27,040 --> 04:27:28,959
so I need to um

2656
04:27:28,959 --> 04:27:30,959
I got a skedaddle while it's still

2657
04:27:32,299 --> 04:27:39,020
Uh, what time is it? It's still it's still not even midnight. Oh, yeah, I gotta make I have I gotta go

2658
04:27:39,659 --> 04:27:41,659
Oh, I gotta go. I gotta get out of here

2659
04:27:41,979 --> 04:27:42,940
um

2660
04:27:42,940 --> 04:27:45,040
But i'll be live tomorrow

2661
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:47,680
Uh, this should give us just enough time to go through the bits

2662
04:27:48,719 --> 04:27:53,600
Just make your calls and come back. Uh, that's that's not gonna happen

2663
04:27:54,750 --> 04:27:58,030
i'll probably be on the phone for like 30 or 40 minutes and at that point, uh, it's

2664
04:27:59,229 --> 04:28:02,989
12 30 one o'clock in the morning eastern might as well just start again tomorrow

2665
04:28:03,549 --> 04:28:05,549
So the plan tomorrow is you'll see

2666
04:28:06,270 --> 04:28:08,270
Not the green screen green screen is thursday

2667
04:28:09,979 --> 04:28:10,860

2668
04:28:10,860 --> 04:28:20,329
Uh, i'm gonna do something else tomorrow something that uh should be fun

2673
04:28:40,170 --> 04:28:43,530
What's the I have to make two phone calls each one is going to last probably

2674
04:28:44,090 --> 04:28:45,930
15 to 20 minutes each

2675
04:28:45,930 --> 04:28:51,319
Maybe more so that's where the 40 plus minutes comes from

2676
04:28:53,479 --> 04:28:57,799
And at that point it's gonna be kind of too late to come back I think to start another stream

2677
04:29:00,440 --> 04:29:02,760
Yeah, I guess one of them is my mother. That's correct

2678

04:34:21,759 --> 04:34:26,009
How much you want to bet germa stops reading these bits midway through?

Life's been dealing me a shit hand lately. I've got hurt and got sent home. My grandpa just died

04:35:32,700 --> 04:35:34,700

2761
04:35:38,779 --> 04:35:40,779
I'm really sorry to hear about that. That's

2762
04:35:43,389 --> 04:35:46,319
That sucks

2763
04:35:46,319 --> 04:35:50,479
But if you can get any joy or happiness or take your mind off something

2764
04:35:51,479 --> 04:35:53,819
um

2765
04:35:53,819 --> 04:35:55,819
happy that you think that

2766
04:35:56,279 --> 04:35:59,639
my shit's worth watching and worth putting on that kind of a

2767
04:36:00,520 --> 04:36:02,520
A pedestal up there. That's

2768
04:36:02,840 --> 04:36:04,840
I don't know what to say. Thank you

2769
04:36:06,250 --> 04:36:14,880
Sorry to hear about your loss

2770
04:36:14,880 --> 04:36:17,470
And that's it for the bits

2771
04:36:17,470 --> 04:36:19,470
Thank you so much everybody as always

2772
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:23,040
uh, sorry for the kind of abrupt stream ending but

2773
04:36:24,240 --> 04:36:26,299
um

2774
04:36:26,299 --> 04:36:28,299
i'm getting texts here

2775
04:36:29,930 --> 04:36:30,889
and it's

2776
04:36:30,889 --> 04:36:34,330
I need to make sure I can make these calls because i'm on pacific time and I keep forgetting that

2777
04:36:36,240 --> 04:36:38,799
It's not late for me, but it's late for everybody else

2778
04:36:41,479 --> 04:36:42,619
uh

2779
04:36:42,619 --> 04:36:46,860
And then right at the end it's rugara for the one dollar sims 4 is getting a first person mode

2780
04:36:46,860 --> 04:36:49,419
Will you do another one with that another murder stream?

2781
04:36:51,340 --> 04:36:56,380
I don't know maybe that probably not though because that was like I can't I don't like going back and doing

2782
04:36:57,500 --> 04:36:59,180
stuff that I already did

2783
04:36:59,180 --> 04:37:00,779
because

2784
04:37:00,779 --> 04:37:06,459
At some point, you know, it was so interesting and so funny to me that going and doing it again is like

2785
04:37:07,200 --> 04:37:08,799
And we're doing it again

2786
04:37:08,799 --> 04:37:12,560
Remember the thing we did again. I don't know. I feel like i'd like to keep that

2787
04:37:13,340 --> 04:37:18,599
preserved

2788
04:37:18,599 --> 04:37:22,680
But thank you. We'll see i'll take a look i'll take a look at that, you know in quotes

2789
04:37:25,630 --> 04:37:30,349
Uh, thank you. Dr. Clay at the end here for five dollars finally get a chance to join the stream in the beginning this time

2790
04:37:30,990 --> 04:37:35,069
With your new schedule. It's a little hard to join the stream live because I tend to be at work when you start

2791
04:37:35,709 --> 04:37:37,549
Thanks for the stream today

2792
04:37:37,549 --> 04:37:42,750
Yeah, i'll have a more clear schedule probably start after the green screen stream is when i'm gonna really

2793
04:37:43,549 --> 04:37:46,040
hunger down here and

2794
04:37:46,040 --> 04:37:48,490
Get all that done

2795
04:37:48,490 --> 04:37:51,369
I would say but in my opinion the green screen stream

2796
04:37:52,189 --> 04:37:54,270
is like the start of

2797
04:37:55,639 --> 04:38:01,880
Here we go. Here comes more streams. Here comes like the stream shit these this last week or so

2798
04:38:02,439 --> 04:38:06,909
I mean remember i've the internet's been all fucked up and i've been moving and stuff

2799
04:38:06,909 --> 04:38:10,270
So these last week or so of streams have just been

2800
04:38:11,470 --> 04:38:17,099
Hey, i'm i'm here and i've had a lot of fun red dad has been fucking a ton of fun

2801
04:38:17,180 --> 04:38:19,369
La noir has been a lot of fun, too

2802
04:38:19,369 --> 04:38:23,450
But i'm still trying to get back into the swing of things and this week has been what that's been

2803
04:38:30,400 --> 04:38:35,740
But we'll see how it goes. Thank you though and let's do the credits

2804
04:38:37,799 --> 04:38:42,040
The credits are going to roll right now. Thank you everybody for your continued support

2805
04:38:42,040 --> 04:38:47,630
You guys are amazing all the subs old subs new subs and I will see you tomorrow

2806
04:38:48,110 --> 04:38:52,330
He's been moving for six months

2807
04:38:52,569 --> 04:38:54,810
Oh, well, not really i'm here now

2808
04:38:55,529 --> 04:38:59,439
He does the credits after the bits. Well

2809
04:39:00,319 --> 04:39:02,619
people have subscribed

2810
04:39:02,779 --> 04:39:06,400
During the bit sometimes the bit readings can go an hour

2811
04:39:07,319 --> 04:39:10,840
sometimes, you know 20 30 40 minutes hour two hours and

2812
04:39:11,799 --> 04:39:14,759
You know people subscribe during that so I figured I'd just do it after

2813
04:39:17,919 --> 04:39:19,919
Remember when bits were two hours?

2814
04:39:20,779 --> 04:39:22,250
uh

2815
04:39:22,250 --> 04:39:24,889
Well, also remember another thing to keep in mind is

2816
04:39:25,930 --> 04:39:30,250
During my normal stream schedule, it would be you know, four to six hours three times a week

2817
04:39:30,810 --> 04:39:34,270
right

2818
04:39:34,270 --> 04:39:36,430
I've been streaming every pretty much every single day for

2819
04:39:37,229 --> 04:39:39,229
seven to ten hours a day

2820
04:39:40,569 --> 04:39:42,569
Why are the credits off to the side a little?

2821
04:39:44,279 --> 04:39:54,119
Um, I didn't even know that thanks. That would mean more bits. Well that

2822
04:39:54,599 --> 04:39:58,270
Whatever

2823
04:39:58,270 --> 04:40:01,900
That's fine. That's not

2824
04:40:01,900 --> 04:40:06,380
Streaming longer doesn't necessarily mean more like money from people giving bits

2825
04:40:07,340 --> 04:40:13,419
It just just kind of you know, people give money. They give money. That's how I see it

2826
04:40:13,419 --> 04:40:19,180
I don't i'm not putting like a a quota of how much money and bits that I have to receive per stream

2827
04:40:19,180 --> 04:40:20,540
That's just

2828
04:40:20,540 --> 04:40:28,840
You should play more old school games too many triple a titles recently

2829
04:40:29,880 --> 04:40:32,189
You mean red dead redemption?

2830
04:40:32,189 --> 04:40:37,000
That's the only one

2831
04:40:37,000 --> 04:40:41,319
I played lethal league with star and then la noir which came out like seven years ago

2832
04:40:42,040 --> 04:40:46,779
That's all i've done since being coming back

2833
04:40:47,500 --> 04:40:56,459
You know, it's still triple a

2834
04:41:00,040 --> 04:41:02,220
Well, I mean

2835
04:41:04,680 --> 04:41:06,680
I I well here's the thing right?

2836
04:41:08,169 --> 04:41:12,139
It's kind of like damned if you do damned if you don't so like red dead

2837
04:41:12,139 --> 04:41:14,619
I started red dead and I stream red dead four times in a row

2838
04:41:15,419 --> 04:41:16,619
and

2839
04:41:16,619 --> 04:41:18,700
If I stop playing red dead completely

2840
04:41:19,500 --> 04:41:24,060
There's probably a lot of people here that'd be like why won't you do what do you want to go do red dead again?

2841
04:41:24,139 --> 04:41:26,139
Why are you leaving red dead?

2842
04:41:26,299 --> 04:41:30,189
You know, i'll go play something else and then three days go by go back to red dead

2843
04:41:30,909 --> 04:41:36,700
It's trying to do a balance, you know

2844
04:41:45,900 --> 04:41:48,700
And plus all these these are all these huge

2845
04:41:49,659 --> 04:41:52,700
You know five ten year in the making games like red dead redemption two

2846
04:41:53,340 --> 04:41:57,500
Is specifically is more than five ten years in the making

2847
04:41:58,459 --> 04:42:02,060
So it's not like a typical I don't really play that many triple a games to begin with

2848
04:42:04,459 --> 04:42:09,630
You know like for the most part I kind of just do whatever

2849
04:42:15,470 --> 04:42:20,750
but that's one of those titles that I would like to experience and play and have fun with everybody with because it's just

2850
04:42:22,119 --> 04:42:24,520
It's it's just the new rock star game that

2851
04:42:26,040 --> 04:42:28,599
It's just so there's so much to do and so much to see

2852
04:42:31,639 --> 04:42:33,639
But I will see you all tomorrow

2853
04:42:34,439 --> 04:42:39,000
Have a fantastic rest of your night. Make sure it didn't miss any bits of the very end here. I did not

2854
04:42:43,689 --> 04:42:45,689
So much to do so much to see

2855
04:42:46,009 --> 04:42:50,970
Sure, but it's always been it's almost you cannot tie loose ends up at midnight

2856
04:42:51,849 --> 04:42:54,990
Yeah, i'm gonna turn to a pumpkin

2857
04:42:54,990 --> 04:42:59,439
But i'll see you tomorrow. We're gonna do something different. Don't worry. We're doing something different tomorrow

2858
04:43:00,080 --> 04:43:08,430
What is it auto? I'll see you guys bro. Have a good night. Goodbye. Take care
