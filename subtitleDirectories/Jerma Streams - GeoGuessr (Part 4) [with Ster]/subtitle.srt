00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:29,030
Hello. Hi. How are you doing? What's going on? Explain yourself. Okay, fine. Guess I'll explain

2
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,539
myself. Uh, so I woke up today and I had a bad headache. Is it- I did the thing where you just

3
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,859
pop two Tylenol, go lie down in bed, and just like sit there and pray with your eyes closed.

4
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:46,619
Go in. Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away. Well, you don't do-

5
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:57,020
that'll make your headache worse, but, um, yeah, I'm okay. It seems to have, uh, subsided a little,

6
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:05,099
but don't be too loud. I would like if everybody could please lower your volume a little bit.

7
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:15,340
I've got a headache today. Can you imagine going to a concert or going to a live event

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,250
and the person you're going to see comes out on stage and you're like cheering.

9
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,810
This person goes, hold on. Wait, wait, guys, guys, excuse me. I have a headache today.

10
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,299
If you could just kind of lower your volume and not be so excited.

11
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:37,109
And they do their whole routine. And every time that somebody, the crowd laughs,

12
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:46,459
like that big crowd laugh, it's just like, stop, stop. I told you guys, please get it together.

13
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,459
This is ridiculous. I'm going to leave. Hangover, Andy. I don't, I don't have a hangover. I didn't,

14
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:09,610
didn't drink anything. That would actually be pretty funny. Oh, I just get headaches.

15
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm just a headache, Andy. I, uh, I've had an MRI of my brain, so there's nothing immediately

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,580
concerning. Apparently that this is ongoing for like a decade plus. So don't worry. I'm okay.

17
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:41,300
But today we've got some stuff going on. I'm going to play GeoGuessr on cam. That's right.

18
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:49,259
I'm going to be on camera today. And then we're going to play Dying Light 2 again with stir.

19
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:55,699
So play, play GeoGuessr for like, maybe like an hour or two. Maybe we'll see somewhere around like

20
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,419
four, four 30. We're going to ping stir and be like, Hey, ready to get back into the world

21
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:09,050
of Dying Light. He's going to go, yeah, dude. So let's go. I think we've spent enough time here.

22
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:20,979
Let me clear my throat. Let me take a sip of water. No cheating. How do you cheat at GeoGuessr?

23
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,689
I don't get it. Don't you have to just kind of guess where you are?

24
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:42,360
Would you guys progress in Dying Light at all? Well, um, kind of kind of, uh,

25
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,060
well, do I, we're not playing Dying Light yet. So we'll tell you about it after we didn't play

26
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:06,550
anymore. We may have progressed. We might have. You can't look up companies or addresses. Oh,

27
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,949
that's fine. I didn't do that anyways. No, we're just going to see if I can know where I am.

28
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,759
Let's go ahead and get it on the screen right now. Hold on. Let me click this. Wait, hold on.

29
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,970
GeoGuessr is a premium service now. Yeah. I already, I already bought it.

30
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,490
I saw the five minute thing and I was like, that's not going to work.

31
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,300
So we're, we're not limited to the five minutes and then 15 minutes.

32
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:50,550
Where's our a hundred community subs. I still can't figure out what's going on. So like I,

33
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,500
I am the process of trying to figure out why that's happening. So there's real debt on this

34
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,540
channel now that I have not paid yet. The jokey two billion debt thing is, was a funny joke,

35
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,519
but now it's real. I owe a hundred community subs that I haven't paid yet. I actually have,

36
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,339
uh, actually have a real debt that I have to pay. So I have not found a solution yet. I'm going to

37
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:25,610
figure that out very soon. I promise. Just keep it, add it to the tab. All right, here we go. You

38
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:43,860
ready? Oh, I had a crazy dream too. I'll tell you that it's fucked up. Can you see me? Okay. So

39
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:51,860
we're going to play GeoGuessr. It's going to be fun. Uh, I don't, this is all like a new menu.

40
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:03,860
I don't know what any of this is. What, what is all this stuff? Beard? Yeah. I have to shave.

41
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,750
It's getting bad. It's getting too long. Don't ask us. We're no, but yeah, look, this is like

42
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:18,629
a completely new website. I don't know. I don't get it. Explore mode, daily challenge, world famous

43
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:25,300
places. Should I just do world? What's like the regular one? Just do world. That's what I'm going

44
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,370
to do. This, this sound effects too. I'm going to hold on. Single player. Yeah. All right. Default

45
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,670
setting. No time limit moving around. Yeah. Start. You ready? I want to full screen this like this.

46
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:51,060
Yes. Okay. All right. Where the heck are we? That's my new series on Twitch. If you check it out,

47
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,180
you check out the title. The title of the stream is where the heck even are we guys? Let's go ahead

48
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:12,709
and start. Okay. Looks a little, looks a little industrial. I don't think, I don't think this is

49
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:21,300
North America. I want to take a guess right off the bat immediately. I would say it's somewhere

50
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:31,860
in Europe, either Europe or, I don't know, the default answer for everywhere. If you don't think

51
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,899
it's America is Russia, right? No, this doesn't look like a somewhere in Kentucky. It's Russia.

52
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:44,069
Like that's not, it's not, it's never is. I mean, it could be, wait, what was that sign?

53
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:58,220
I don't, wait, go back. How do I zoom in? It's just mouse scroll, right? What's that? What's that

54
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:17,480
say? Uh, I don't know what that says. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to say Italy. I think it's

55
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:36,600
somewhere in Italy. I think that was Italian. No, that's not, that's not Italian. Wait a minute.

56
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:52,549
Russia. This is Russia. That's Russia. That's Russian. I don't know. I don't know what language

57
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:59,669
that is. All right. It's, okay. It's not here. So let's go over here. I've been doing the thing

58
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:10,889
where I'm just holding the mug. Okay. Here. Let's keep going. All right. There's no time limit,

59
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,960
but I feel like that kind of should be. Maybe I should turn it on because eventually I'll figure

60
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:34,139
it out. Right. Okay. What does this say? I, I N A. Wait, what's that? Ineos. Wait, what? This is Japan.

61
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:44,600
This is, we're in Japan. What? No, that's, this can't, no, what? This is not Japan. What flag is

62
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:55,190
this? This is not, is that the Jap? That's not the Japanese flag. What is that? I don't know what

63
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:05,820
flag that is. Okay. Wait, it's probably like here. Of course this isn't fucking Japan. Am I stupid?

64
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,059
All right. I'm, I'm going to say, wait, they got the state puff marshmallow man over here.

65
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:24,460
What happened? What? I thought my screen got, why is there a bullet hole in my screen? I honestly

66
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,500
thought there was something wrong with my monitor for one second. I was like, why is there a fucking

67
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:39,929
bullet hole? What is that? It's a tree. All right. I get it. I, I'm going, I'm going, we're going

68
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:55,159
right here in Lida. I'm guessing. Let's go. It's not bad. Where was it? Slovenia. Okay. That wasn't

69
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:10,950
that bad or no Croatia. Okay. I mean, it was across the entire continent, but whatever. Okay.

70
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:25,799
Now this, this is a, this is the United States of America. Orange, Orange road. Keep left.

71
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,669
I feel like that sign needs to be a little bigger because it looks like it's been run over like

72
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:47,399
a hundred times. I feel like they need to make this a little more elaborate. I'm, hold on. I'm

73
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:58,019
thinking, I'm thinking we need to see some business or something here at Hearst golf range.

74
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:09,720
It's somewhere in the South, but is it though? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. Now

75
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:19,509
that we're looking at it for another minute, am I going to take a sip of this fucking coffee

76
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:23,590
already? I've been holding, how long has the streaming been live? I've been holding this

77
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:34,899
right here for 13 minutes and I haven't sipped out of it yet. What's that school zone? Eight to

78
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:47,720
nine, two, 30 to four, 40. Wait, does this say you can go 40 in a school zone? Isn't that too, way too

79
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:10,139
fast? 40? That's zooming in a school zone. Oh, I thought it was like 60 in a school zone. Holy shit.

80
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:16,330
All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this bus stop? This is,

81
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:27,159
it's probably, I think it's in the South. 40 miles per hour school zone. Where's the school?

82
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:33,720
Where's the school? N school zone was on this side of the road. Where is it? Is that a school?

83
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:49,419
Is that a school? Remember, you're pretending. I am not pretending. There's a flag right here,

84
00:13:51,139 --> 00:14:05,539
but it's like folded over. I can't, I don't know what that says. That's Australia. I mean, yeah,

85
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:24,600
you don't know that. Wait, closing day and boarding college, pre-kindergarten to year 12.

86
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:36,740
Oh shit. SU. And I don't know why I thought that was not safe for work. What? I was like,

87
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:45,980
what are you talking about? Scott Saints, NS, like what the fuck? All right, that's the AU.

88
00:14:45,980 --> 00:15:00,330
We're in Australia. But where in Australia? Australia is fucking huge. I know absolutely

89
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:12,100
nothing about Australia. Nothing. I would say, let me keep going. Wait, N. Oh shit. That's right.

90
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:23,299
NSW. Stop cheating. I wouldn't have gotten that. Oh, I think it's pretty close to Sydney, Mike.

91
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:29,450
All right. Got it. Stop cheating. Stop. All right. Now I'm not going to look at chat for

92
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:38,730
the rest of the, I'm not going to look at chat. All right. This is leaves are turning, which could

93
00:15:38,730 --> 00:16:02,309
mean many things. Is that a ALFL? I can't tell. I can't read it. Anything's like a state or

94
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:09,639
something in there. I'm not going to look over a chat. I swear to God. I've seen leaves turn,

95
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,419
which that only happens in New England. The leaves only turn in fucking Boston. They don't

96
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:30,419
turn anywhere else. You guys ever been to Maine? Don't look at chat. Wait, what's this? Birch Harbor

97
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:41,700
estates. Okay. Birch Harbor. This is definitely, this is definitely either all the way up or all

98
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:58,009
the way down, all the way up or all the way down. I don't, I don't think, hold on. Let's keep moving.

99
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:13,019
What does that say? Only, only, all right, nothing. Wait, we got a, we got a business up here. Alaska.

100
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:21,220
It was AL. Okay. This is Alaska. I told you either all the way up or all the way down. We're in Alaska.

101
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:29,779
Free bears Alaska. Is that the name of the, did they just put that there to make it so people that

102
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:42,579
play GeoGuess or know what town it is? Is there a three bears Alaska? Delta Junction. I, this is

103
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:46,420
definitely not on a coast. I don't think, I think it's pretty much in, but Alaska is fucking huge

104
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,849
too. It's so, wait, my face cam is in a bad spot. Isn't it? I put my face cam top, like middle right.

105
00:17:53,849 --> 00:18:02,359
Hey, look at this. Let me, let me move the face cam. Top right, but then you can't see that.

106
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:16,420
No, I didn't want to turn the face cam off. No, wrong fucking button again. Wrong button again.

107
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:30,630
Wrong button again. What the fuck am I, what's, what's my OBS doing? Oh, okay. That's better.

108
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:38,220
That's good. All right. So we're in three bears Alaska, which who knows where the hell that is.

109
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:56,599
Stop looking at chat. All right. Well, we know we're in Alaska. Let's see if we can get a town.

110
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:08,869
Oh, nope. Anything else here that would give us a, give it away? Liquor, grocery, pharmacy,

111
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:15,589
fresh meat, fresh produce, sporting goods. It's got everything. This is like, this is an everything

112
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:27,430
store. Sporting goods too? Well, there's produce there. What does that mean? I'm giving it like

113
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:43,079
another minute. Fresh produce. I, I said the word wrong for a second. Like please. Auto care.

114
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,980
Nope. Nothing there. It's definitely in the middle. I see mountains in the distance though.

115
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,710
Almost all of Alaska is a mountain. That doesn't help me at all. Wait, or does it?

116
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:14,779
Look at this over here. This is pretty mountainous up here and it's pretty mountainous down here.

117
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:25,400
See that in the distance over there? I think this is the clue. My voice is such junk because

118
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,519
that's a mountain. We're either really far away here or, okay, here we go. Ready?

119
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:42,309
Oh my God. What's wrong with me? Grizzly group. Grizzly group cafe. Quilt Alaska.

120
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm going with the mountain technique. He's old. I know. I know. Shut up. What's that say?

121
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:07,019
Or even ribs. That place is probably like 10 out of 10. Oh my God. Why are there, why is it

122
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:16,680
like a Canadian geese congregation of mailboxes over here? This feels like, this feels like too

123
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,519
many. Okay. We're in Quilt Alaska? I don't know. I'm going for it. Here we go. We got the mountain

124
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,420
range here, mountain range here. I'm going to go, I think it's a little bit closer to Anchorage.

125
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:37,430
I'm going to say it's like right here. Right between McGrath and uh, and Nikolai. That was

126
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,950
actually pretty good. That's not bad. I really should have just said Anchorage. It's probably

127
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:53,579
these mountains right here. This is like beautiful. Oh my God. This is like incredibly

128
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:04,740
lush and gorgeous. Okay. Where are we? Hump. I think we call it bump in America. I don't,

129
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:17,180
I don't think we call it hump. It's a, we call it bump. Who would say hump? This is a nice place.

130
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:34,420
I see uh, I see industry over here. Okay. All right. Okay. We are in, where are we?

131
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:45,059
We, I saw a flag and my brain is trying to figure out what flag that was and I have a pretty good

132
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:54,220
idea, but I'm not going to say it because I don't want to sound stupid. Oh, Chatsworth Road. That's

133
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:19,720
where you guys live. Okay. It's over here. But where? Where? Chatsworth Ave. This is Chatsworth

134
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:28,069
Road. Chatsworth Ave. All right. What's going on over here? We've got buildings. This is like

135
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:53,849
we're in like a city area. It's that T. Chatsworth Road. All right. I think I got an idea. Danger.

136
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:10,730
High voltage. I'm not going to look at chat. Chatsworth Road again. What's that? Hold on.

137
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:17,990
This is like a park. Taxi. What's that say? Max height limit. Three meters. Okay. Hold on.

138
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:28,839
What's that say? Passenger pickup. I want to get over to that building. I think I get a better idea.

139
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:56,740
Okay. It's somewhere over here. I think. What's with Chatsworth? Is every road Chatsworth?

140
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:14,660
Watch this be like somewhere like Louisiana or something, right? Like what if I'm just

141
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:24,579
completely wrong? But wait, it's all in English. Wait, what? Every road is Chatsworth. Where are we?

142
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:51,720
Hold on. Times are changing. Times are changing. Hyundai. We build tomorrow. Okay. So Hyundai.

143
00:25:52,599 --> 00:26:07,029
Hold on. They are building tomorrow? No. That's not what it means. That means like Hyundai. We build

144
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:13,539
tomorrow. Like they're like a technology company. That's not what that means. Like that's not like

145
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,140
announcing that they're going to be starting building tomorrow. That's them saying that we

146
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:47,500
build tomorrow because they're a tech company. What flag is that? Road works. Whoa. That's...

147
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:59,160
I love that little thing. That's so cool. Is it animated? Does it go like... Oh, that's so cool.

148
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:11,900
Land Transport Authority. All right. I think I know where this is. I know where this is. But I'm like

149
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:20,650
too stupid to remember where it is. I just know that it exists in the world. I just need to figure

150
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:28,549
out where it exists in the world. And I'm not going to say where it is because I don't want

151
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:34,549
people to think I'm stupid because I don't know where it is. And I now know where it is.

152
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:50,039
Okay. I now know where it is. I've narrowed it down to here. Ministry of Education Headquarters.

153
00:27:50,039 --> 00:28:15,450
But what country? Ahead. Humps. I don't... Hold on. I'm not leaving yet. What's that? Escape?

154
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,920
I got it. I told you it was right here somewhere. And everyone thought I was stupid. All right.

155
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:35,609
Where? Wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Is this an ad saying to come visit Malaysia? What if that's

156
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:41,930
an ad saying like, hey, leave Escape where you are right now and go to Malaysia for a vacation?

157
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:55,829
Right? Uh-oh. I don't know. I don't know. That could be... That could just be like an ad to like

158
00:28:55,829 --> 00:29:11,819
go visit Malaysia. Oh, shit. Uh-oh. I don't know. All right. I think we're going to get a big reveal

159
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:33,819
coming up here. I'm not looking at you. I'm making... What does that say? SG. What's SG?

160
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:50,500
What's SG around here? Singapore would be SP. SG? Wait. No, it wouldn't. S... Sing... This is

161
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:59,849
Singapore. Where? Wait. Singapore is in Malaysia. Wait. No, it's not. What? Oh, shit. No, it's not.

162
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:04,809
It's not. It's not. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it said visit Malaysia. Singapore is Singapore.

163
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:11,289
It's different. No, they confused me with a huge text on the screen. They confused me. It's here

164
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:26,759
somewhere. Where is it? I'm going to keep going. SG. That's Singapore. Somebody I caught in chat

165
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,940
earlier said South Africa. No. SG. That would be South Gaffrica. No, that's not what this is.

166
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:45,900
This is Singapore. Mandarin Hotel. Going to meeting... Getting meetings is faster.

167
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:56,420
Is that... It's Singapore. All right. I'm going to get... I'm going... I'm going for it. We're done.

168
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,410
No. Is it... Or is it like Malaysia? Because it's like, hey, visit... I don't know.

169
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:11,369
Wait. What was that? That truck had something on it. Who's that truck?

170
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:25,019
Where's that truck? Where's the truck? What happened? Oh, God. It disappeared.

171
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,089
I missed my, like, quest opportunity. All right. I'm going for it. I'm going to say

172
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:37,059
we're, like, probably in, like, a downtown area. Wait. One last little check here. What's this say?

173
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:48,250
Land Transport Authority. Okay. I'm going to say that means it's probably, like, a land transport.

174
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:59,400
It's probably, like, down here. I'm going to say it's, like, here. Let's go for it. Bingo. Done.

175
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:07,750
And that was very, very close. They almost got me with the Malaysia ad. I was like, oh, shit.

176
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:21,579
But does it mean go? Does it mean... I don't know. All right. Let's go. Snow. Snow. Right off the bat.

177
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:32,279
This actually could be... This could be New England. I thought they were going to fucking

178
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,039
get us with that one. Oh, yeah. You forgot to clean up the snow, GeoGuessr. Oh, I forgot to clean the

179
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:45,990
snow up. Yeah. Sorry. I caught it. They could hide it. They could, like, melt all of it everywhere

180
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:53,380
else. No, you didn't catch that part. I think that's, like, a... Is that, like, a state flag or

181
00:32:53,380 --> 00:33:00,089
something? I don't know. Is it a bird or is it a moose? It looks like a bird. All right. Who has a

182
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:11,880
state bird? Every state has a state bird. Who has a state bird that looks like that? Who has a state

183
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:20,099
bird? This is... Yeah. Look at these homes. This is definitely... This is, like... This is, like, New

184
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:28,569
Hampshire or something. Oh, absolutely. This is, like, New Hampshire. Or, like, Vermont or something.

185
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:46,250
Let's go out this way. Gotta get to a main road here. And this is how I know it's... This is how I

186
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,859
know it's probably New England. Because, like, good luck finding the main road. Because, like,

187
00:33:51,859 --> 00:34:02,009
there's a shitload of these neighborhoods that just lead into each other. This is New England. Yep.

188
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:08,730
Absolutely. I'm convinced. Yeah. This is definitely New England. I thought a driveway was a road.

189
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:26,460
This is New England. Oh, yeah. I'm convinced. Get me to a main road and I'll confirm it. Yeah.

190
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,869
Oh, yeah. Without a doubt in my mind. You know why I... You know why I know this is New England?

191
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:40,420
Easy fucking answer. This snow was probably here. Let's say that this photo was taken in, like,

192
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:50,860
March. That snow probably snowed in February. Or, like, January. And it's just still there.

193
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:57,900
I'm going for it. I don't think I need to see anything else. And I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go,

194
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,880
like, right on the border here. I'm gonna say, like, I'm gonna say, like, Western Mass up into,

195
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,679
like, kind of the, like, the New Hampshire potential, like, Vermont area. I'm gonna go

196
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:13,739
right here. Fuck out of here. You don't think I know my own place? You don't think I know my

197
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:22,420
own country? Are you shitting me? You don't think I know what I'm doing? It was closer to Boston,

198
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:42,010
but still. That's up in Newton. That was an absolute giveaway. That was a giveaway. Let's

199
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:48,710
do it again. This is fun. I could have said closer to Boston, but I figured it was a little bit

200
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:56,699
further out. Closer to New Hampshire. Uh, let's do it again. Are there sound effects? How come

201
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:13,190
I don't hear anything? All right. This is... Razor King. Where even are we? I have no idea.

202
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:26,139
Pharmacy? Butchery? Fast foods? It's like a little... This is a market. All right. I think,

203
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:47,349
I think I've got an idea. Get out to a main road here. What's that say? Otimo Saco. Wait! What's

204
00:36:47,349 --> 00:37:03,460
this? Otimo... Otimo Saco. It's definitely not over here. It's definitely down here.

205
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:24,949
But where? Forward Travelers. Otimo Saco. Otimo Saco. What is this? Good times. Good times.

206
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:38,179
Jackpot! Jackpot on the top of the truck. Wait! There's a chemist! Pharmaceuticals

207
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:59,699
chemistry. I love, I love the word chemist, by the way. Where are we though? Breakthrough Summit

208
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:12,010
2018. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What's that say? In 21 days. I can't read that.

209
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:31,110
Rwanda. I don't know where that is. Are you sure it's Rwanda? Hold on. Oh, I gotta go back to the

210
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:41,239
chemist. You're reading chat. I don't know! I'm not! I have to read chat sometimes. I don't know where

211
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:55,860
Rwanda is. Where is... I don't know where that is. You're an ignorant streamer. I don't know where

212
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:06,820
Rwanda is. I don't know. Central... I don't... I know it's like... Oh, shit! There it is! Thanks, chat,

213
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:15,639
for shit. Right here. Let's go. You didn't even have it correct! You guys got it wrong!

214
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:30,250
I love chemist. Billy Hills. Oh, that's not... I thought that was like a sign of where we were.

215
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:53,269
Vote for Billy Hillis. But where? What state or county? That's Billy Hillis. Okay. That's either

216
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:03,159
somewhere in the UK or a GTA NPC character that you do missions for that like has a tractor.

217
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:11,239
And like at some point during the story, like drives the tractor through like a store to save

218
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:17,110
you. And you have to get in the tractor and like drive the tractor and like avoid the police and

219
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:37,559
stuff. So we're... It could be either one. Classic tractor NPC joke. All right. Where are we? This is

220
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:51,000
a... This is definitely... Is it one house? How do you get your trash out here? This is like a hundred

221
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,449
miles away from the... Your driveway. Can you imagine how... Imagine lying on the couch with

222
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:08,489
no pants on? Just being like, ah, I gotta take the trash out. You gotta go for a fucking walk.

223
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:23,690
That sucks. That's so... That's too much. That kind of house, you just have a maid. I don't know.

224
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:44,460
You have to get a golf cart, a trash golf cart. Somebody said that's not that far? This is far.

225
00:41:46,170 --> 00:42:00,630
This is a far way to go. To bring a bag of trash here. That's far. Yeah. I don't know about that.

226
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:07,500
That's like you look out this window and even get in the barrel too, right? Like when you know you

227
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:15,380
gotta go get the barrel, you just look out this window staring, just going, I'll get it tomorrow.

228
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:25,420
And then tomorrow you look out there again and you go, I'll get it tomorrow. You will drive by this

229
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,250
barrel. You will pull into your driveway and you'll look out the window and you'll go, fuck.

230
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:44,380
And you'll just keep going. Barrel? I mean barrel. Barrel. Barrel. Trash bar... I call it a barrel.

231
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,579
Trash can. I call it a barrel. I'm from a different part of the world than you. Sorry.

232
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,539
Sorry, I'm from a different part of like the country than you. I'm not in the same country

233
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:56,980
that you're in. I call it a barrel. It's a barrel. Well, sorry, we have different ways of talking.

234
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:09,079
Donkey Kong trash can. It's a barrel. Whatever. I'm not... I'm not gonna take a sip out of this

235
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:16,579
just because you said that. A barrel. Okay, you wanna... Okay, what do you call the thing that

236
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:26,119
changes the channel on your television? We have to talk about this every six months.

237
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,170
Changer. I call it a changer. A remote. When I was younger, we called it a changer beeper.

238
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,400
It was just the... It was the changer beeper. And that was cute and fun and whatever. Sorry,

239
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:44,780
we talk differently. Clicker. No, sorry, you don't say it right. It's the remote control.

240
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:56,579
TM. You say clicker. You say changer. Sorry, you got it wrong. I don't know why you did that.

241
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:06,760
All right, this is definitely... This is def... I don't know. I'm gonna go like up here. Like here.

242
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,119
It's probably like the Netherlands or something. Or like UK. I don't know.

243
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:20,260
We need to live in more information. This is... Wait. Oh, I went backwards. I was like,

244
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:44,820
why is every house the same house? This cow is just here. All right. Wow. That's cool.

245
00:44:45,380 --> 00:45:16,219
I think I'm narrowing down my decision here. Not yet. This is so beautiful. It's so great.

246
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:20,300
Okay, I've never been to the UK before. Never been to Ireland. Never been to Scotland.

247
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:26,630
But does anybody else feel like it just smells nice here? It's probably the air is probably so

248
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:53,340
clean. It's probably so fresh. What's that say? Einstein. Einstein rugs. I don't know. Wait a

249
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:19,030
minute. That's rugby. I'm fucking around. I'm kidding. All right. Where are we?

250
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:33,559
Oh, we're gonna get it right off the bat. It's gonna be right here. Dude, is that a fresh wild

251
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:43,260
apple? Are you serious? Where is this? That's a fresh wild orange. Or is that a wild tomato?

252
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:50,889
That's a wild tomato. A wild onion? Holy shit. That's awesome. This is wild fruits and vegetables.

253
00:46:51,449 --> 00:47:05,340
Oh shit. All right. Where are we? We're in Asia somewhere. I can't get over that wild like

254
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:34,139
orange. Are they more like wild fruits? Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know. I don't know where,

255
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,889
but we're here somewhere. Holy shit. I hope you didn't hear that. That was so gross. That's worse

256
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:53,320
noise there. If it picked up on the mic, it was like a bullfrog. It was like, all right. Oh my

257
00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,949
God. Can you imagine the amount of wild berries and fruits that are out here? Oh my God. This is

258
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:11,639
so... I feel like you live longer if you're in a place like this. Like you're surrounded by

259
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:19,000
like agriculture and oxygen and not like Starbucks and tar. Don't you think you probably live longer

260
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:31,670
when you live in a place like this? Surrounded by wild onion trees. It's like a lot of us are

261
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:38,500
just like surrounded by like concrete and lights. I imagine if like you were surrounded by like

262
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:58,150
oxygen and wild berry trees. Okay. Wait, we got something here. Shit. I don't know how to read

263
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:10,230
that. What's that? That's something dot dot. Is that dot K U? Dot K U. Something dot K U.

264
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:20,469
Is that a website? No, that's not a website. I thought it was like something dot like dot

265
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:25,179
com or something. I thought that was a website. I thought that was a website. All right. That's

266
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:37,219
not a fucking website. It's a website. Fucking goddamn idiot. All right. It's... I'm gonna...

267
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:51,579
We're gonna go here. I've narrowed... It's somewhere in this square. I'm not pretending. I'm really just

268
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:58,659
like... I don't know. My brain's a little deluded. All right. I'm... Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

269
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:18,809
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Uh-huh. Oh, yep. Oh, yeah. Yep. Hold on. Let me

270
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:45,289
get it closer. Let me get it closer. Yep. It's close. Ah! Oh, it's an animal! What is that? It's

271
00:50:45,289 --> 00:51:02,789
like a bat flying into the camera. What is that? What is happening? What is this animal? There's

272
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:19,739
like an animal stuck. Why is it like flattened on this windshield? It's following you. Okay. Where

273
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:28,070
are we? What the hell is happening? Is it... Wait. Is it a leaf? Or is it actually like an animal or

274
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:51,449
like a bug on the camera? It's changing. Whatever it is. It's growing. Is it a bag? I don't know.

275
00:51:52,170 --> 00:52:03,449
All right. Where are we? This looks like, um... I'm seeing sand here. It looks sandy.

276
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:29,429
The sand. Okay. We got a UPS shirt on? This dude is fucking jacked! Holy shit! What a Chad!

277
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:51,670
This is like a Giga Chad! I see the American flag. So, we're in the United States. It's

278
00:52:51,670 --> 00:53:12,860
deserty. That could be a few places though. This guy. All right. This is... This might actually be

279
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:22,900
somewhere down here. This is... This is potentially like the kind of Nevada, Arizona,

280
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,980
potentially like New Mexico. Like, I'm thinking New Mexico. New Mexico, Arizona. I'm thinking.

281
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:37,800
Like, somewhere over here. I don't think this is Vegas. I don't think this is Nevada. Although,

282
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:47,099
no. No. I don't know. It's close. It could be. It actually could be. It could be right here.

283
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:56,659
I'm gonna say, like, it could be here. But we're not done yet because it seems like we're getting

284
00:53:56,659 --> 00:54:07,400
to a road here. Texas is a lot more green. Texas is a lot more green, but there is a lot of green

285
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:25,110
here. I'm thinking Arizona or New Mexico. What's that? Welcome to Highland Ranch. Wait, why did

286
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:41,579
it just turn into a different fucking season? Wait, what? What happened? What? It just turned

287
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:52,070
into a different state. It ain't down here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No chance in hell.

288
00:54:52,070 --> 00:55:07,719
It's up here. Where? Maybe it is Texas. I don't... I don't know. This is not Colorado. No way.

289
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:18,730
This is, like, somewhere over here. I don't think it's this far up. No, it's not that. It's not

290
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:26,440
north Utah. It's southern Utah. In fact, it could be Utah and Nevada border here. Something like

291
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:43,349
down here. I don't know. It's close. Let me keep going. Whatever that animal is, it's still here.

292
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:55,800
School. Hold on. Wait. Something up here. Whatever that is, we're gonna get a look at it.

293
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:08,780
What is this? School? It's a school. Does it have a name? What's the name of the school?

294
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:22,230
Ah, Virginia. No, that's... no, Virginia's the name. Virginia Palmer. Go Palmer. Good luck on your

295
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:34,300
tests. This is not... this is not... this is not Virginia. No way. No, this is... it's impossible

296
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:44,460
for it to be Virginia. All right, I'm gonna make my guess here. There's snow, so I'm leaning more

297
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:50,699
towards it not... I'm leaning more towards it being, like, here. Salt Lake gets snow. This area,

298
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:55,300
I don't know. But when you go up here, you get into, like, Wyoming and Idaho, and it's not

299
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:02,730
like that. I'm gonna... I'm going right here. Right here, kind of near the Nevada border, but not

300
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:16,019
quite Nevada. I'm going here. Right here. Fuck! It was Reno! Oh, shit! That makes sense, because

301
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:24,920
right here, a border of California. I gotta stop thinking about Vegas. That right on the border,

302
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:43,719
that's right. Yeah, Reno does get snow. That's all right. Italy. Italy, France, and Italy. This is

303
00:57:43,719 --> 00:58:02,840
Italy. Where in Italy? Italy. Done. That's speedrun right here. Wait, that was the... I thought that

304
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:11,050
was the Italian flag. Does this mean don't... is that a no entry, or is that a flag? Does this

305
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:16,500
mean you can't go in here? This looks like a, like, don't enter. Wait, what is that? That's not...

306
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:23,050
what flag is... that's a flag, but for what country? I thought it was, like, boats don't go this way.

307
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:30,789
Is that... that's not French. Italian. This is... okay, we're in Europe, and we're somewhere over here.

308
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:42,539
We're somewhere here, I would say. Not that far down. Somewhere, like... I'm gonna sit right here

309
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:55,670
for just a minute, because I'm not 100% sure. What? They got Dippin' Dots! They got Dippin' Dots! I

310
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:04,230
know where we are now. Whoa, these are fucking crazy. How come we don't have these? What is that?

311
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:20,630
I want that one. Nouvelle. Nouvelle. Solero. Mojito. Extreme. I don't think this is Italy.

312
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:43,769
I don't think this... I don't think this would be in Italy. What is this? Wait. Switzerland.

313
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:54,360
Rado Switzerland. This is... this is Switzerland. Or maybe it's not. It's probably... it's close to

314
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:07,579
Switzerland, though. It actually could be, like, one of these, like, here. I know we're... hold on,

315
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:21,369
I know where Switzerland is. Just give me a sec. Where the fuck... where is... where is it?

316
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:50,809
Where is... where is Switzerland? They don't have it listed on this one. All right. It's... it's... they

317
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:57,050
have a... they have a Switzerland ad and a French flag that leads me to believe, with a little bit

318
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:05,449
of deduction, that we are potentially really close to Switzerland in France. I'm gonna say

319
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:21,699
we're somewhere here. I want a little bit more info. Cars can drive down here? Wait, what?

320
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:28,780
Why are there just cars here? I thought that person crashed into the wall for a second. I was

321
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:38,900
like, what... why are they crashed? You can drive down here? I feel like this would be, like, a...

322
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,619
I would be terrified to drive a car here. There's, like, a lot of people.

323
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:53,179
You're gonna go up this? I don't know. That would, like, freak me out. What's that sign say?

324
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:07,059
I don't know. All right, so we're in France slash Switzerland. What's that say?

325
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:20,739
Okay, so tout du futur stationnaire. I gotta... wait, there's a... there's, like, a lake here. All right,

326
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:28,949
this... look, there was water, so I'm gonna say right here. Paris. Okay, really? Where's the Eiffel

327
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:50,219
Tower then? NA education? I feel like I'm, like, about to start, like, mission one of an RPG,

328
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:57,190
like, a Far Cry game. I'm, like, following the NPC somewhere. Where are... where... what... where did

329
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:06,679
put me? Where is this? What is... what's going on? Where are we? Where the fuck are we? It's...

330
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:11,639
it's the beginning of, like, a Hitman level. Is this, like, a... like, a bridge club for,

331
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:21,099
like, old people? What is this? No, this is a tour guide. There... this is a tour somewhere.

332
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:28,949
So this is... this must be a landmark. I don't know what it is, though. Let's keep going this

333
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:48,949
way. See if we get any more data. There's a lot of people here. I see camera. I see camera. Tour guide

334
01:03:48,949 --> 01:04:12,300
camera. I see brochures on the ground. Damn. Is this a line? Okay, there's a tour guide here

335
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:20,489
giving a speech. Why did the Google car drive down here? Can you imagine just sitting there

336
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:29,380
getting, like, a tour? And, like, the... the Google car just scans all of your faces?

337
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:57,610
Virginia! Virginia. I see a Virginia t-shirt. What's on the hat? Oh, I can't read... lightning?

338
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:08,099
I can't read it. Is a tour... yeah, this is a tourist area in Virginia or somewhere in that area.

339
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:33,500
Okay, wherever this is, this is like a... why, the trees have names? Markings? Where is this? Hold on,

340
01:05:33,500 --> 01:06:02,630
that's... oh, shit. Is this, like, an old, like... hold on. Where is this? This is, like, an old,

341
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:09,750
an old fucking, like, plantation or something? What the fuck? Okay, where are... where is... where

342
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:41,400
are we? Monte... Montecello. Montecello. Where's that? Where is that? Where is that? Okay, I'm

343
01:06:41,400 --> 01:07:02,780
looking for it. Monte... I don't know. I don't know where it is. I'm just looking... I'm just looking

344
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:30,659
for the town. Oh, nope. All right, here's Maryland. Like, right here? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

345
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:52,889
ah. Come on, I can't get this exact. I'm gonna say right here. Ooh, okay, it was... it was right

346
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:59,420
outside of Charlottesville. What the fuck? All right, well, we got... okay, we got that one.

347
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:08,679
Wait, what time is it? It was on the screen? Fuck, whatever. All right, so I... Ster and I got a...

348
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:15,030
I'm having too much fun, but Ster and I are... have a scheduled date for Dying Light 2. So,

349
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,789
maybe, like, one more. Maybe one or two more. Ster, if you're watching right now, then, like,

350
01:08:18,789 --> 01:08:36,729
just, um, maybe, like, another 20, 30 minutes. All right, this is absolutely, absolutely

351
01:08:41,619 --> 01:09:09,380
somewhere with a lot of green. A lot of green. Birds. He said birds! This is not in the United

352
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:22,630
States. This is somewhere else. Where? This is... I'm thinking, like, is this, like, Greek? No, not

353
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:37,020
Greek. It's, like, Spain? Is this South America? This could be, like, hmm. I need more intel. I

354
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:50,090
need a little bit more intel. Does that say? I can't read it. I don't know. I need a little

355
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:58,170
bit more intel. You think it's Greek? I'm not reading chat right now. I don't know. I just

356
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:10,090
think... I thought, like, Greek. I don't know. What is that? That's just, like, a picture of something.

357
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:34,630
A sign with a picture? Is that a picture of this road? Is it a mirror? Whoa! I changed my... I

358
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:46,840
changed... I think it's South America somewhere, I think. Like, here. I need way more intel. Ah!

359
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:51,420
Wait a minute.

360
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:05,800
French. No, it's not French. That's like a shitty dressing that somebody made up.

361
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:20,310
It's French dressing and ranch. Can I get some French dressing? That's... No, we're here. We're

362
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:29,560
somewhere here. We're somewhere here. I'm going for it. Right here. Oh, that was French! That was

363
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:40,500
French. Ah, I should have just known. I was speaking... I was saying, like, the French words

364
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:48,199
too. 28 fucking points. My god. Why did you think Brazil... I don't know, because Brazil is, like...

365
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:54,279
Brazil's got, like, so much, like, lush, like, beautiful green, and I don't know. I saw, like,

366
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:59,720
the... I thought it was, like, I don't know. I'm just... I'm not very well traveled, okay?

367
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:26,899
Not at all. Am I kind of stuck in this parking lot? Ooh. Estrella de Luz. Okay. Hold on. Hold on

368
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:39,000
here. Fashion store. Saldos. Vestuario, lingerie, digitaria, ten... All right. Okay, okay, okay,

369
01:12:39,000 --> 01:13:02,760
okay. Okay, okay, okay. This is not France. Oh, hold on. All right. I don't know where this is.

370
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:17,130
Serras do Porto. I think it's in this area. Bem-vindo seja bem-vindo. Gondomar parades

371
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:29,020
velongo. Como alto, patrón sinio de sua excelencia. Something is excellent. I need to find out what

372
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:59,180
it is. President of the Republic. Preacher. I need more intel. This could be... this could go

373
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:13,460
either way here. I... this could go... it could be either one. This is either. I don't like Mondays.

374
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:32,949
Oh, Pedro. Yeah, yeah. Property. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Pedro. Es Pedro. Escola de...

375
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:39,029
I don't... this could go... it could be either way. This is either Europe or

376
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:52,279
like Central America or something maybe? I don't know. It's either North America, South America,

377
01:14:54,569 --> 01:15:28,380
Europe, Asia. 999 euros. What is that? That's euro. So now where? It's got wi-fi.

378
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:49,479
Sondo P.T. Okay. I don't think we're on a coast though. Not a coast. Yeah, this is... this is...

379
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:59,529
I see a lot of green. A lot of green. Wait. Porto? Why does Porto ring a bell for me? I swear to

380
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:12,039
God, Porto was somewhere. Going right here. Oh, man. That was close. Okay, cool. All right.

381
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:34,470
I got it. Let's automatically get this set over here. Would be anywhere in this vicinity. Tamaya.

382
01:16:34,470 --> 01:17:01,510
Okay. Tamaya. Parking a hundred something. Right? We got... no, never mind. I don't know. I really

383
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:05,909
don't know. This could... I mean the easy answer here is... what does that mean? What's that?

384
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:36,739
What is that? Is that... I don't know. And... wait. No. Is it Japan? Osaka. This is... yeah. This is

385
01:17:36,739 --> 01:18:00,090
Japan. But where? In Japan. I'm just putting the names into memory so like if I see them.

386
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:22,949
Here we are. Let's go. Toyama. Anything that can get me closer though because this is pretty big

387
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:30,659
place. I'm not seeing a lot of green. I think we're somewhere down like in this area. I'm gonna

388
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:39,659
go right here. What? Wait. That was Nintendo? What do you mean? I didn't see Nintendo. Where?

389
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:51,210
Nintendo HQ? What? All the signs said Toyama. I didn't know I was next to Nintendo. I'm pissed

390
01:18:51,210 --> 01:19:12,819
now. I saw all the signs. Toyama. Toyama. Toyama. I saw like three of them. Okay. This is... what are

391
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:21,670
these? These are very individually placed. Very deliberately spaced out trees. This is a farm of

392
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:38,550
some sort. What are they growing? This is very deliberate. These are berries. Wine. Wine land.

393
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:52,729
If it's wine then it's either somewhere in Italy, South America, or California. This is okay. I think

394
01:19:52,729 --> 01:20:13,829
we've... or it could be Spain, Soviet, and Venta. Everything is just Italy. Every place is Italy for

395
01:20:13,829 --> 01:20:32,949
I don't know why. It just is. Yeah. These are... these are wine trees. What's that? Yeah. Okay. So

396
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:38,470
this is... these are grapes. This is wine. What's a part of wine? I see a city in the distance. That's...

397
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:53,590
that's not Los Angeles. Is it LA? No. This is down here somewhere. Where's all the wine made?

398
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:11,050
Let's just go there. I... no. Where is that? Okay. I'm gonna go this way until I can figure out.

399
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:23,100
All right. We got somebody here on the road. What flag is that? Relax. It was a joke.

400
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:54,279
I've seen like motorcycles and that stop sign looks a little sus, doesn't it? I'm getting a lot

401
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:59,560
of minus twos. I'm just saying that stop sign does not look like a stop sign that... I don't think

402
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:06,520
this is America. I think we're in South America and we're about to get over to this city and we're

403
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:12,680
gonna see what it says. Wine country in South America or wine country in North America,

404
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:26,359
Central America. I don't know. This could be somewhere here. You know what? I'm... I'm going...

405
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:31,880
I'm going probably Argentina. That's what I'm thinking. I think this is potentially Argentina.

406
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:53,350
In fact, yeah. We're going right here in Argentina. All right. One more. One more. One more. One more.

407
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:58,300
Last one. One more. Maybe one more after that. Defensive stir like starts yelling at me.

408
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:15,720
All right. Where are we? The tow zone. Art, art. Art, art. Art for art. Object 19.

409
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:33,029
Burgtheater. The Burgtheater is over here. This is... is this like... it's Sweden maybe? Denmark,

410
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:41,060
Sweden. I don't want to look at chat. I don't want to give it away. Panzerhalle.

411
01:23:48,869 --> 01:24:02,869
Wait. Is this Germany? Is this... no. Austria? Hungary? Slovenia? It's not Texas.

412
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:32,020
This is... I think this is Texas. This is absolutely Germany. But where? Object 12.

413
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:38,119
Let me get out to like a big street.

414
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,279
This is... this is definitely Germany. We got to find the city though.

415
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:23,960
Mobilix? No. Oh, it's... there was Burgtheater. The Burgtheater. Hamburg. Austria. Okay. All right.

416
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:34,569
I think I've got an idea. I'm thinking... I'm thinking Greek. I'm thinking Greece. See?

417
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:53,670
Greek lettering. Well, we're back. We're over here again. Okay. Well, we're... I know where we are.

418
01:25:54,229 --> 01:26:19,800
I just don't know what... I need specific names. This is Japan. No, it's not. This is not Japan.

419
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:28,500
I don't know what are these... these things. It's like a weird... it's like... is that so you can see

420
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:48,470
like over here while you're driving this way? Where in Japan? This looks a little more country

421
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,229
to me because we're out here with the big mountains. The big... I don't know. This feels

422
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:57,829
a little more country. I don't think this is in a major city. This is not like Tokyo or like

423
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:14,630
Kyoto or, you know, I... this is... this feels kind of like country. What is going on here?

424
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:29,050
What is this? That... is that water? This is crazy. This is... okay. That's cool. It's making...

425
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:38,250
they're making rice? Really? You just like make your own rice? I feel... they all live... I feel

426
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,449
like you... I feel like... like if you live in a place like this, you'd live like a fucking

427
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:49,779
hundred plus years. Like I don't have like rice behind me. I've got like rocks and like dirt and

428
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:59,739
concrete. Like imagine if I had like a fucking whole thing behind me. They're like... I could

429
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:05,239
just get my own shit. I can't do that though. I would ruin everything. It takes a lot to do that.

430
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:11,270
You make your own rice. You make your own like fucking tomato. People... I mean people do that.

431
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:18,060
People like make their own tomatoes. I don't know. I feel like it's different. It's different than

432
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:22,380
you taking a picture of like the tomato vine you bought. Like on Instagram. Like this is one of

433
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:28,310
them. Like maybe if you live in like the farmland or something, right? I'm not talking about like

434
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:34,630
the... like the fresh tomatoes. And there's like three. Like that's not what I'm talking about.

435
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:44,119
I'm talking about like you literally live and eat off of like your land. Grow your own tomatoes.

436
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:59,899
Don't you live in the U.S.? I live in the fucking desert, man. All right. I'm saying Japan,

437
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:06,899
grow some agave. Yeah. I mean I could grow... I could grow agave. But what's that gonna do? Like

438
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:21,560
I'm gonna squeeze that in my coffee. All right. I'm going here. Right here. Done. It's close. I knew

439
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:40,180
it was like kind of in the country. Grow your own weed. Okay. This is weird. I never... Okay.

440
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,739
I might... This might be weird. Oh! I didn't tell you about my dream. Okay. But this is more

441
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:49,800
important. So it's gonna be kind of messy because I don't really... It's hard to piece it together

442
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,399
because I woke up and I like fell back asleep and woke up. I think this is why I have a headache.

443
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:59,670
So I had a dream... Remember the dream that I had a while back where I was naked on stream

444
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:06,069
and like I went up like this and like my like my you know genital area showed like a little bit

445
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:09,750
right here and I freaked out and nobody said anything in the chat and I deleted the vlog and

446
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:16,489
shit. This was... That evolved. This was... This was 2.0 that dream. So let me see if I can like

447
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:24,470
piece this together. I need to take a second. In this dream, it was a big event stream and it was

448
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:29,899
like there's a ton of people watching and it was a big event, right? Whatever it was. And I don't

449
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:35,100
know why. I have no idea why. My brain just decided to do this. At some point like in the

450
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:43,000
middle of this stream, we had to go BRB and like I had to change like costume. I gotta get in my

451
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,039
new... I gotta get in a costume. Okay. Costume change. And I don't know why but like when I came

452
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:55,859
back like from the BRB like at five minutes, I was naked. Like naked with a towel like in like

453
01:30:55,859 --> 01:30:59,619
with me. Like walking around like I had just got out of the shower and like maybe I didn't like

454
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:04,069
expect that like the camera was... I don't know why this was happening. Like I was changing like

455
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:08,630
in like an area or something and like the camera came back and I was like on stream and I was like

456
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:15,050
what the fuck is going on? Why am I on... What's happening? And like I freaked out and like the

457
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:22,630
stream ended, right? Here's the... Here's the fucking crazy part. Apparently... This is like

458
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:29,510
three hours of the stream had been going at this point. Apparently, the stream was not pushed to

459
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:39,100
the Twitch servers. So we were... This was just broadcasted to nothing. So I was like no way.

460
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:44,859
Wait, what? So we haven't even been streaming? Oh my fucking god. This... That's so... Oh my god.

461
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:49,479
Thank god. Like there was a camera problem. I don't know what fucking happened. Whatever, right?

462
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:53,720
So I was like wait a minute. So we have like the studio recording version of that whole stream

463
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:57,720
and it was like Community Jake was like yeah yeah we got the whole thing recorded man it's all good

464
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,140
and I'm like fucking Jesus. I don't know how I like walked into frame. I don't know what happened

465
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,460
but like wait a minute. That whole stream was like a bunch of money, a bunch of time.

466
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:12,329
Why don't we just like censor that part and I'll just like... We'll just do a rebroadcast,

467
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:20,069
right? Instead of removing the scene entirely. I was like why don't we just like rebroadcast,

468
01:32:20,069 --> 01:32:23,909
like play the video and like just because I didn't like push the Twitch servers or something.

469
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:31,979
What the fuck? So instead of removing the whole thing, just cut that part. We had like a black

470
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:40,310
censor bar over me during that part and the worst part about it is when it got to that point like

471
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:47,989
I don't know if it was I edited it I guess but like when it got to that part and like one frame

472
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:54,409
was not moved correctly and you still saw me naked and I'm being like what the fuck man what

473
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:59,130
I'm still naked you what happened we're supposed to censor that part did I miss it

474
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:07,670
and like everybody freaked out in chat. Like I don't know why our brains do this shit. Why

475
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:12,979
wouldn't I have just taken that part out of the stream? Why wouldn't I have just taken that part

476
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:20,390
out? Why did it have to be there with a censor bar? The fact that like it was streamed and like it

477
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:26,550
got caught like holy shit oh my god thank god I caught that oh we can just re-upload we can

478
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:35,640
just do like another broadcast but make sure make sure we censor that part so stupid that was the

479
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:43,689
dream because please keep your dream journal if you don't I know I always say I'm going to but I

480
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:50,489
every time I have a dream I wake up I kind of feel like shit and I go I gotta go back to bed I feel

481
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:58,409
terrible and I put my head down and I fall back asleep you go over the dream like 30 plus times

482
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:03,609
in your brain and then you fall back asleep you wake up an hour or two later and it's gone

483
01:34:03,609 --> 01:34:09,560
and maybe a little bit is still there all right where are we and now I have like a really bad

484
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:17,670
migraine today so it's kind of annoying if you have a lucid dream yes and the thing about a

485
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:22,470
lucid dream is when you start to become aware that you're lucid dreaming you have to like use

486
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:28,810
magical superpowers to concentrate to keep yourself from trying to get out so you sit there and you go

487
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:36,420
wait don't move you kind of have to not move you have to sit there and just go don't move don't

488
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:42,979
just don't think and just let yourself become lucid without becoming completely lucid because

489
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:50,760
if you're like here we go I'm in the lucid dream you're out once you are aware of lucid dreaming

490
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:58,439
stop and just don't do anything don't think don't move let yourself just solidify into the lucid

491
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:03,260
dream if you want to because once you're aware of it it starts to pull you out it's really hard to do

492
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:13,640
your lucid dream just look at your hands no I mean no no here's the thing if you flick lights

493
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,409
they don't work if you look at a clock it won't work you can't here's things about dreams that

494
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:24,180
are interesting if you use a light switch in a dream it will not turn on it won't work that's

495
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:30,199
how you'll be like wait what the fuck's happening if you try to read in a dream you cannot read

496
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:36,659
that part of your brain is not turned on so if you look at a clock or a or a like a piece of

497
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:41,220
text or a book you're going to be it's going to be just mess you did I don't know what that says I

498
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:47,239
can't read that it's nothing it's like this alien language if you look in a mirror be careful

499
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:50,760
because when you look in a mirror your brain decides to fill in those blanks because a

500
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:57,159
mirror does not work in a dream so you will see horrifying twisted shit if you look in a mirror

501
01:35:57,159 --> 01:36:03,850
I'm serious like don't be careful when you look in a mirror uh because your brain has to pretend

502
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:09,380
that you're actually looking into a mirror and your your mouth your eyes might get like big and

503
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:14,260
like black and like your chin might be like shaking it's seriously like a horror movie

504
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:33,750
oh yeah it's weird I saw that I saw that in a reddit post too you see the thing is I learned

505
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:40,470
all this from I watched a movie called waking life okay and that movie came out in like 2002

506
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:56,970
so I did not read the reddit post that you're talking about oh I read reddit too Jeremy well

551
01:47:57,909 --> 01:48:03,399
bringing up a lot of times like oh we're just talking about like uh sandwiches too much and

552
01:48:03,399 --> 01:48:07,079
I'm like don't want to I have like too much fun when I'm with you and I owe my game crashed

553
01:48:08,039 --> 01:48:17,109
do you want to play GeoGuessr or like a round or two uh you want to co-op some GeoGuessr I mean I

554
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:23,380
think there's a co-op mode but I think um you have to like pay for it though I could just look at

555
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:27,859
your screen you could just look at the screen and like yeah like let's do that how I mean I'm not

556
01:48:27,859 --> 01:48:41,859
going to help because I've only left the U.S. like once no it's don't worry let me open this up

557
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:48,520
let's play some GeoGuessr so this is let me explain how this works

558
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:54,279
so GeoGuessr is a game yeah I know how it works okay so you tell the people someone here doesn't

559
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:59,479
know no no no they know that no no this is a policy that I have it's called no chatter left

560
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:03,479
behind I feel like a lot of streamers will you know they won't will leave someone behind and

561
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:07,159
they'll just be there like I don't understand what is he looking at okay and so you have to

562
01:49:07,159 --> 01:49:11,640
explicitly every 10 minutes whenever someone asks what's going on is make sure you in detail

563
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:16,359
re-explain what's going on so can we get one good explanation from you no no no everyone

564
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:25,100
everybody knows how to play this I just unlocked a razor cannon a two-handed bike razor cannon

565
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:36,340
wait you got a cannon yeah and now it's gone wait what oh I was looking at something else

566
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:42,600
I'm gonna not capture my screen I didn't play GeoGuessr it's a game where hold on

567
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:59,659
can you please explain it why can't I capture it it's annoying so I have to I might have to

568
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:14,600
like restart my obs this is annoying don't do that it obs crash uh it actually may have hold on

569
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:18,819
black screen andy I know I know I know I know I don't know what happened hold on let me try this

570
01:50:18,819 --> 01:50:47,130
what the fuck what the fuck did I get it ah I got it that was weird I had to restart this like

571
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:54,659
three times all right I'm gonna change my stream title because this is wrong so as you see let's

572
01:50:54,659 --> 01:51:01,590
go and get that face cam turned on so as you see wait I'm gonna have to see your face you don't

573
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:06,739
have to but okay so can one and can one of the mods please change it to GeoGuessr you don't

574
01:51:06,739 --> 01:51:11,699
change your own stream titles I have to like get I don't I do but if somebody can do it it's easy

575
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:17,939
all right so as you see on the screen here you have to decide where we currently are where are

576
01:51:17,939 --> 01:51:22,659
we where it could be anywhere in the entire world it's just any place that has been captured by a

577
01:51:22,659 --> 01:51:31,159
google device right so google um like street view google uh cars google taxis google bicycles

578
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:38,680
whatever it is I'm gonna do one and then you can do one okay well we're not gonna do it together

579
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:42,979
oh wait that would be like I so I want to know how well how much you know I don't know anything

580
01:51:42,979 --> 01:51:48,579
okay well then I'm not then just watch the street just turn the stream on and watch

581
01:51:48,579 --> 01:51:57,420
okay just watch your stream that's what I'm doing now I'm watching Jerma stream all right I think

582
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:05,399
this is I'm seeing some text up here koditar koditar.fi I think that might be Finland I think

583
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:12,090
we're in a Finland area here yeah I'm just watching would you say sir that this is fi

584
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:21,350
Finland makes a lot of sense doesn't it um I mean that makes sense okay if we keep going down

585
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:28,659
we're looking for something that would be give us an idea of exactly where we could be

586
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:38,760
we're in Finland somewhere but can we narrow down the city well how how far do you get to

587
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:43,779
travel down the road before the thing is like hey come on man you can as long as you want

588
01:52:43,779 --> 01:52:49,859
there's no time limit unless you set a time limit so there is none okay I feel like you should be

589
01:52:49,859 --> 01:52:54,579
setting a time limit then because couldn't you just drive around and just ask for directions

590
01:52:54,579 --> 01:52:58,579
I mean yeah but the whole point is that you don't spend too much time you just wait zoom

591
01:52:58,579 --> 01:53:03,300
in on that license plate license there are here yeah they're all blurred out you got to find a

592
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:08,359
non-blurred one and I'll track it they all license plates are blurred out like can we get some can

593
01:53:08,359 --> 01:53:12,600
we get some facial recognition no those are blurred out too have you ever used google street view

594
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:18,520
before I have but sometimes they might miss one all right I'm gonna say this is pretty this is

595
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:26,949
pretty the green uh lush environment how close of a guess like how close to the city do you

596
01:53:26,949 --> 01:53:34,119
consider yourself a winner I would say within five miles you've won within five to ten miles I say

597
01:53:34,119 --> 01:53:43,029
that that's a win that's pretty tight but within like 50 miles I think that you did a good job

598
01:53:43,029 --> 01:53:53,029
okay all right we got a bus station here what is it to blur it out can't read it 4 000 is a good

599
01:53:53,029 --> 01:53:58,659
score yeah that'll get you within probably like what 50 plus miles uh there's a lot of bikes

600
01:53:58,659 --> 01:54:07,159
100 miles maybe a lot of motorbikes over to your left there is that's kind of cool okay I'm going

601
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:12,699
you know where I'm going I'm going Finland seeing a lot of rain I'm thinking of going I think we're

602
01:54:12,699 --> 01:54:22,149
in uh Kivola just based on nothing that was that was all right that was all right that's not 130

603
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:27,350
miles that's not even good you said within 50 miles was good job yeah 131 miles that's okay

604
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:32,659
that's not bad that's more than double what would what a good job would be and you're patting

605
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:39,699
yourself on the back by your own definition lane control all right we get this is english

606
01:54:39,699 --> 01:54:50,090
lane control on main road ahead lane open lane closed gizzards gazzards for decorating wait we're

607
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:55,770
I don't know we're driving on the left side of the road though so I think this is somewhere in

608
01:54:55,770 --> 01:55:08,279
Europe it's always Europe goals fabrics okay this to me this looks like England look at this like

609
01:55:08,279 --> 01:55:18,060
uh Big Ben clock thing that's England do you know what I mean hell any bank on the windows

610
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:26,859
under the clock tower and the windows oh okay so this is helenny antique center all right so

611
01:55:26,859 --> 01:55:35,880
where's helenny that's what we're gonna figure out I'm gonna go to England helenny I'm saying

612
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:44,550
maybe the London area what do you think maybe somewhere in London um let's keep going somewhere

613
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:54,500
like in America like I've heard of America hearing care this is the driving on the right side of the

614
01:55:55,300 --> 01:56:05,609
we're on the other side of the road it's not America dolphin hand car wash we need to find

615
01:56:05,609 --> 01:56:16,859
helenny there's so many little towns here though it could be any of these orly new romney is it

616
01:56:16,859 --> 01:56:26,819
cheating if you just google helenny yes that is 100 cheating city center all right barnsley is

617
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:38,260
that way at some point we have helenny we have barnsley and we would barnsley be I need a big

618
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:49,369
town like I need a sign that says like london freeway that way or something I feel like you

619
01:56:49,369 --> 01:56:54,890
have the city name and the note the next most adjacent city like what what more do you need

620
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:58,659
you need to get it right you have to get it on the map yes so like shouldn't you be looking on

621
01:56:58,659 --> 01:57:02,579
the map rather than around the city because we already have everything we need but we but we

622
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:05,939
don't though because we're looking for something that can tell us where a major city might be

623
01:57:05,939 --> 01:57:16,359
located like a road sign or like oh over here okay low fields park sheffield city council

624
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:23,239
stir excuse me look at where we are sheffield and that's why you spend a little extra time

625
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:31,460
now we've got sheffield the next step is to look for it's there it's right south of it right here

626
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:38,920
helenny if you zoom in heli that's heli not helenny we probably read it wrong do it do it

627
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,680
just no no that's not right this is god please please please it's not gonna be right this is

628
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:46,760
heli you click please please I'm not gonna click it because we could get we're co-opping we could

629
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:50,760
get like 10 000 points if you get it right you did the first one this one's mine I noticed the

630
01:57:50,840 --> 01:58:01,510
first sign I'm in charge click it literally if we spent literally if we spent like five more

631
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:13,289
minutes we would have found it 900 yards and you're complaining but you opened up a google map

632
01:58:13,289 --> 01:58:18,409
what what are you talking about didn't you just say why don't you just type in the location and

633
01:58:18,409 --> 01:58:28,600
I heard I saw the the name we thought it was wasn't even the name so even if I googled it I'd be

634
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:34,859
looking for helenny not heli all right do you see what's on the screen now I see what's on the

635
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:43,369
screen you're just mad because I got like within a like a mile okay so this is either this is

636
01:58:43,369 --> 01:58:50,619
potentially United States somewhere like in middle America this could be somewhere in like Japan or

637
01:58:50,619 --> 01:59:04,010
I need to find a main road I feel like that's cheating cheating is typing in helenny into google

638
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:11,300
it wasn't helenny and pretending you know where it is click it click it yeah I just tried to

639
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:21,130
wink and both of my eyes bugged out there's a freeze frame in there somewhere that is terrifying

640
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:34,060
all right here we go we got a road where we going okay okay this is potentially somewhere

641
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:50,619
somewhere in Asia and get some signs here okay I think this is let's get over here closer I don't

642
01:59:50,619 --> 02:00:01,899
think this is not Japan is it Japan no it's not this can't be Japan is it Japan I've gotten Japan

643
02:00:01,899 --> 02:00:10,279
so many times in like the five times that I did this in a row well everyone everyone loves Japan

644
02:00:10,279 --> 02:00:19,699
but it's a random place in the world mm-hmm okay it is Japan yeah ask that guy you pass the guy on

645
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:34,100
a bike ask him okay no I don't think so so what sign are you looking for when you can't read the

646
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:41,189
language I'm looking for you in there's a lot of times this the town name will be in English

647
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:51,850
or at least written out so you just do this forever I mean it's kind of the point of the game

648
02:00:51,850 --> 02:01:08,180
in Japan yeah hmm big solar field out here this is the countryside they're not going to do that

649
02:01:08,659 --> 02:01:16,949
they might they might yeah they might I mean we're just you're on a nice drive right now you guys

650
02:01:16,949 --> 02:01:21,130
got to enjoy the journey I guess is what I'm learning yeah it's cool you should play this on

651
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:30,890
stream tomorrow so I can watch I I would be playing with like 30 second timers I hear German likes to

652
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:34,649
go fast I just I'm just I just want to know man make sure everybody's aware that like literally

653
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:42,579
this is in English and everyone was think said I was an idiot wildlife protection area shows

654
02:01:42,579 --> 02:01:52,500
Shaozong prefecture wildlife protection area whatever it says I don't know you told them

655
02:01:52,500 --> 02:02:00,020
your mic is still compressed no it's not I think mine is mine sound like I reset mine it still

656
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:03,140
sounds like it's messed up which is why I didn't want to do this joke in the first place because

657
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:06,579
now we're all the way down here and we're just going to keep doing the joke the whole time

658
02:02:06,579 --> 02:02:18,310
I don't want to turn that on right now but I'm going to so what I think we're going to do here

maps is I guess they you said they have google bikes they're driving around like yeah this is

698
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:30,489
this is not a car yeah that would be weird this is either South America or somewhere in Asia

699
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:47,859
a lot of terrain looks a lot like what's the name of that place I don't know it could be like

700
02:09:47,859 --> 02:10:04,420
Central America could be wait I got a sign what does the sign say uh yeah you're right there

701
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:20,920
what is that I don't know what language that is um okay that removes South America for me

02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:35,670
but then it has to be over here Antarctica no it's not uh I can't go any further oh he's got a

703
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:52,539
guess he's got a geo guesser uh wait okay I'll go down this road is it something here uh

704
02:10:55,510 --> 02:11:04,020
on that little note what's this I can't wait until the future when you can play this game and

705
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:09,859
on like a drone and a drone just goes around and annoys people and you can like put money into the

706
02:11:09,859 --> 02:11:13,939
the game client to like annoy people and be like hey where where is this and you can like ask

707
02:11:13,939 --> 02:11:20,380
questions and everyone in the world knows the game you're kind of describing like tourism in

708
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:26,789
general like people go and to travel to different places and they like walk around like the books

709
02:11:26,789 --> 02:11:31,260
and the maps and shit and like ask people stuff yeah this is gonna be a thing they're gonna sell

710
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:37,020
like a drone you activate the geo guesser drone and you have to pay money to ask questions to

711
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:44,090
people all right I'm going for a guess starting the business I'm gonna say it's somewhere in here

712
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:51,180
uh let's go with put it uh I'm I would put my guess right in the middle

713
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:56,359
it's right here of the ocean there just so that I can get all of those islands

714
02:11:56,359 --> 02:12:07,319
and equal distance I'm gonna say hey hey hey hey hey is that the same that's that's the same

715
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:19,560
writing isn't it oh bingo right here let's go right here island that was cheating how was it

716
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:26,380
cheating all right so that was cool uh 65 miles you're 15 miles off of being good all right I'm

717
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:33,510
gonna do the challenge to play today's daily do you have what it takes to become a geo guesser

718
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:45,699
master navigator start let's start the game maybe you can get your I'm gonna make a multiplayer room

719
02:12:45,699 --> 02:12:51,640
with you since he has geo guesser pro oh give me what I got your pro I'm peeing just entertain the

720
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:56,680
audience for a minute I'm just supposed to sit here and entertain the audience when I have no

721
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:01,880
control over the mouse the keyboard uh he's the one with the geo guesser pro and apparently I can

722
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:10,069
play with him and generally speaking oh I'm actually shocked he didn't mute and deafen

723
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:18,699
because he's usually so scared of what I'm going to say while he's gone but the truth is that I'm

724
02:13:18,699 --> 02:13:26,760
a nice guy I don't say anything weird I mean like sometimes I talk about like like weirder stuff

725
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:33,619
like Hillary's emails and like all the comment in it and those are just like it's just life

726
02:13:33,619 --> 02:13:45,500
it's all exists yeah I don't know everyone's obsessed with cum these days talk about furries

727
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:51,479
well I don't know does your most chat know about I feel like I talk about my furry policy so often

728
02:13:51,479 --> 02:13:56,970
I'm spreading the word at this point you gotta gotta be a furry now to get the tax credits

729
02:13:56,970 --> 02:14:03,060
for when it's uh it's a thing in the future and you can check the box for furry but if you don't

730
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:06,020
have evidence now that you were always a furry and you're just gonna look like you were playing

731
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:20,869
along everyone has to know that by now I've told pretty much everyone what's he saying is he saying

732
02:14:20,869 --> 02:14:30,520
something bad did he say something bad what do you say I'm giving them like uh legal tax advice

733
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:39,609
don't do that please all right we have three minutes here we go Northwestern University

734
02:14:39,609 --> 02:14:48,789
that's that's California right there California uh okay where probably in the northwest wait what

735
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:54,229
the fuck dude but that's California no it's not I just looked like California it was shaped like

736
02:14:54,229 --> 02:15:07,590
California okay all right I got two and a half minutes all right uh I'm gonna go over here I

737
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:13,800
think it's in that same kind of area that we were before like down here maybe I'm gonna say I'm just

738
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:21,939
gonna go for it we only have two minutes I'm gonna say like the Philippines or our timing this is

739
02:15:21,939 --> 02:15:28,779
the challenge the challenge no no no no no no it's not no it's not this is over here this is like

740
02:15:28,779 --> 02:15:42,840
somewhere over here don't look I'm not looking all right I'm gonna say like uh Bangladesh right

741
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:53,340
here oh my fucking god I've nailed it next round okay good one yeah you know pretty good the time

742
02:15:53,340 --> 02:16:10,569
do you get you get more points this one's gonna be hard Oklahoma it could be we gotta go kind of

743
02:16:10,569 --> 02:16:16,170
fast down this road though there's no way you don't have time you need to guess these long roads

744
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:33,159
you're never gonna see anything oh my god you're just losing time shit uh this is not Oklahoma man

745
02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:45,579
this is way Oklahoma's not like this what is this like side of the road are we on we are on the

746
02:16:46,649 --> 02:16:52,700
right side of the road is driving you can see the car behind you okay so we okay so where is this

747
02:16:52,700 --> 02:17:06,299
though this is anywhere it could be uh I'm gonna say damn it's like a cloudy day too so it's like

748
02:17:06,299 --> 02:17:14,649
it's hard to tell um hmm I think this would be further north more like a Montana maybe I could

749
02:17:14,649 --> 02:17:27,530
see a Montana Wyoming Dakota kind of area let's uh let's go with Wyoming I'm gonna say right in

750
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:41,180
this kind of area here like here Wyoming let's go yo I was not even close I was gonna say some

751
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:53,190
of the trees looked a little yeah for us but the right side of the road and this is uh I think this

752
02:17:53,190 --> 02:18:01,479
is European I don't see these signs in America looks like California yeah I think it's California

753
02:18:01,559 --> 02:18:10,500
look at these little green things what are these little green containers these are like tiny little

754
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:19,430
recyclings and to Nova are these really small or am I crazy these are tiny well Americans have a

755
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:26,200
lot of garbage that's all we have look at how little these are okay yeah this is like normal

756
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:45,979
size like rubbish for a family it's a Nova Antenna Nova I there's something going on up here this is

757
02:18:45,979 --> 02:18:55,110
somewhere in South America probably shit we're right in the middle of nowhere again

758
02:18:55,110 --> 02:19:11,899
this could be this that was like a dead animal or something this could be the same exact spot

759
02:19:11,899 --> 02:19:21,110
this looks pretty much uh it's either okay I'm saying down in that same exact area or

760
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:36,260
somewhere in like Europe like here any input I have never left my home all right well I'm going

761
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:42,790
with like Russia I'm going with like I did hear earlier that you always go with Russia a good

762
02:19:42,790 --> 02:20:03,989
reason you think everywhere in Europe is Russia it's like ratio okay we're this is Asia but where

763
02:20:03,989 --> 02:20:16,459
in Asia let's go which way look what looks more populated down here I don't know it's not Japan

764
02:20:16,459 --> 02:20:25,940
again is it Japan again again I mean it's been this is like so how rare would this be to have

765
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:37,909
it in like anywhere in the world and I've gotten Japan like seven times okay here we are that's a

766
02:20:37,909 --> 02:20:42,870
nice hill that's what I really I'm liking this this tree hill Japan's fucking beautifully okay

767
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:50,569
oh yeah you got names Naroshi and and Suzu and Naroshi Suzu's closer 15 kilometers yeah

768
02:20:50,569 --> 02:21:08,540
Suzu is closer oh no was it Naroshi I got one minute and 52 seconds to find it this could be

769
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:13,030
big points here Naroshi or Suzu Naroshi or Suzu come on

770
02:21:19,139 --> 02:21:48,360
hmm no come on one minute you need this man Naroshi or Suzu

771
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:27,190
um I need this 40 seconds hmm shit yeah also you could look for 249 highway 249 25 seconds

772
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:45,079
there's so many numbers on the screen good luck 15 seconds yeah this is a fake image

773
02:22:45,079 --> 02:23:01,610
from uh this place isn't real Africa wait this is where I clicked

774
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:09,340
you must not have clicked in time or something because that's I'm pretty sure that's like zero

828
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:25,430
because I clicked Greece because you said Greece thought it was Sweden I don't know why

02:34:00,229 --> 02:34:06,250
I saw a sign wait what the fuck is what did that say I thought that said it was healing me less

834
02:34:46,979 --> 02:34:57,180
really really we just got the full health double damage on this one okay oh shit

835
02:35:34,579 --> 02:35:44,459
I should have taken an extra 30 seconds tripled yeah you could win I could win with this triple

damage of these bushes and seconds dude come on how did you how did you even know that how did

837
02:36:42,579 --> 02:36:46,819
you even know that because I see I had previous knowledge from hump ahead how did you know that

838
02:36:46,819 --> 02:37:03,770
just looking around there's a lot of clues in the environment also how many of these have you done

839
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:09,209
before that feels kind of fucked up I've done this like five times total yeah but if you keep

840
02:37:09,209 --> 02:37:13,610
getting the same ones you like twice you said you've already gotten these I mean it's it's

841
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:19,049
likely you're gonna get similar the same country more there is a whole world what do you mean there

842
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:26,950
before I was actually fucking with you when the grease thing came up I made it up

852
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:54,440
15 seconds sure Russian roulette last one in the barrel why California because it's the first

853
02:40:54,440 --> 02:41:25,500
place I could click into a half a second I don't know man what the fuck um I I don't I actually I

854
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:34,059
don't I have no idea how would you put that pressure on me because I'm trying I'm trying

855
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:54,790
to do the pressure I'm trying to put the heat on really I'm just trying I'm just you know

856
02:41:58,059 --> 02:42:02,139
um um um um I don't know I'm kind of banking on you not clicking anything

857
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:08,299
or apparently just like accidentally consistently like getting a little bit closer I knew that was

858
02:42:08,299 --> 02:42:14,920
like somewhere up in kind of the European area yeah 15 seconds is too much I'm giving them too

859
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:53,639
much time okay thought I knew but now I don't clicking you could any moment yeah I don't think

860
02:42:53,639 --> 02:42:58,340
you're prepared I don't think you are either I don't think you're ready for this

861
02:43:01,139 --> 02:43:20,809
I don't think you can handle this I know exactly where we are I don't think you know I've been

862
02:43:20,809 --> 02:43:24,809
down this dirt path many times so how come you haven't clicked if you know where we are

863
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:42,260
you're so confident I'm definitely more certain now

864
02:43:45,750 --> 02:44:12,420
can I change my answer I would have beat you honestly if I could have changed my answer I

865
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:20,090
would have beat you in one turn but what would have made you what what made you change your mind

866
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:36,790
after you clicked just get the language oh this is Greece okay might as well just want to stop

867
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:51,430
now this is Greece yeah that's Greece right there so I would so click Greece if you're so confident

868
02:44:51,670 --> 02:45:10,090
if you're so confident it's so residential it's so hard to tell

869
02:45:32,729 --> 02:45:50,219
oh so you heal from this one you don't like damage the other person this is just a healing

870
02:45:50,219 --> 02:46:07,860
room I am understanding I get it give me something to fucking work with it not like

871
02:46:07,860 --> 02:47:05,940
city skyline signs what is that supposed to mean I don't know I don't know man I don't know I

874
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:42,420
right there like when there's pressure I can't do anything like when I'm up against like somebody

875
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:49,860
else I'm just going to sit here with my fingers up my nose yeah just guess what do you just like

876
02:47:50,579 --> 02:47:54,979
just 10 seconds like all it matters is whether you do that I don't know I'm gonna say like here

877
02:47:54,979 --> 02:48:15,270
somewhere oh it's CA not California Canada but if I had a few seconds to think that through I

878
02:48:15,270 --> 02:48:21,979
wouldn't have clicked that but it's not always you know in life you don't always have as much

879
02:48:21,979 --> 02:48:28,139
time as you want I know but like if I had if my brain was not in like dreamland and like the music

885
02:51:51,690 --> 02:52:13,159
slowing down I'm trying to figure it out slowing it down a little I don't know where it is this is

886
02:52:13,159 --> 02:52:31,780

890
02:53:44,309 --> 02:53:55,000
California I was looking at every I saw the Mariana Islands and I was looking at every I

891
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:59,079
checked the islands over there and I fast and I just like there's so many islands off of California

892
02:53:59,879 --> 02:54:04,440
it starts it's not like this passport center and these trees are so not I know but it's like

893
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:08,680
office of the secretary like commonwealth of the northern but that sounds like that sounds

894
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:15,000
American to me yeah it is I think it's like it's a US territory somewhere in the fucking ocean out

895
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:26,940
there so I just clicked in the ocean all right actual last one one more okay actual last one

896
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:32,790
it is American I know but like I thought it was gonna be like right there yeah we don't we don't

897
02:54:32,790 --> 02:54:39,299
let anyone be independent just play all of our independence all right let's do it fuck that

898
02:54:39,299 --> 02:54:50,600
I'm one let's go you're gonna get three zeroed so bad I've been here before yeah but like okay so

899
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:54,840
stir has never played this before but you never know when you unlock a new game that you're

900
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:58,840
actually really good at and you never knew it I'm not very good at GeoGuessr so he could be

901
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:02,280
actually pretty good at it and he's like finding a new thing that he's actually really good at and

902
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:11,719
he could like just play and stream it and stuff I always have problems with languages I think as

903
02:55:11,719 --> 02:55:22,389
as an artiste I pick up on a lot of like tiny little artistic like architecture details

904
02:55:22,389 --> 02:55:30,809
that I've seen before but I have no fucking clue where this one will be

905
02:55:32,889 --> 02:56:05,909
real it didn't count my click did it where were you clicking it didn't count my click I was so

906
02:56:05,989 --> 02:56:14,010
close to that why was there Russian and English oh man I saw a sign it was English Russian and then

907
02:56:14,010 --> 02:56:20,649
um like um Malaysian whoever was I saw a lot of weird shit I was thinking Madagascar for a

908
02:56:20,649 --> 02:56:24,889
second I was way too zoomed out to take tourists I thought was the safer guess

909
02:56:31,139 --> 02:56:34,659
there's a lot of places like uh only one place I've been where did me and Ashley go

910
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:42,940
Cayman Island there remind me a lot of that where everything is made for Americans to tourism there

911
02:57:16,069 --> 02:57:26,200
uh wow we were both waiting why was there a French flag it was like a French flag right there

912
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:37,479
uh street names are French I just like I was like I'm okay French but it's even the name of this

913
02:57:37,479 --> 02:58:03,100
language there's so many different languages it's so hard to oh I have no idea

914
02:58:17,799 --> 02:58:19,399
it looks like the one

915
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:57,129
yeah the ring was engraved with the elvish it's elvish oh my god give me a break

916
02:58:58,549 --> 02:59:04,979
give me a break you're the one that guessed but they were they were two how did you know I

917
02:59:04,979 --> 02:59:10,489
guessed because it gave me 15 seconds but how do you know that how do you know that yeah I didn't

918
02:59:10,489 --> 02:59:16,809
know that that was a literal guess I mean we're it's geoguessr is what I'm saying here so you

919
02:59:16,809 --> 02:59:20,649
didn't look at my camera and see my hands go up and do that I don't know I'm looking at your camera

920
02:59:21,450 --> 02:59:55,110
dude they have the fucking longitude here oh it's just I think I saw somebody's dick what was that

921
02:59:55,190 --> 03:00:07,739
what was that that was weird what's going on what was that I couldn't even click I was dumbfounded

922
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:17,659
what do you mean it said like peep show and there was a guy sitting on a chair it freaked me out

923
03:00:17,659 --> 03:00:21,979
okay well you can heal up this round you don't have to see any dicks that I was literally like

924
03:00:21,979 --> 03:00:55,860
oh here comes the peep show and there was a guy like sitting down like this it could be any of

925
03:00:55,860 --> 03:02:24,340
these it's crazy how like how many we've done in a row and they've all been greased we had the same

926
03:02:24,340 --> 03:02:32,729
idea but whatever I mean you healed I did a little bit of double damage

927
03:03:16,229 --> 03:03:27,459
that is actually almost exactly where I was clicking I saw this thing that was like an ad

928
03:03:27,459 --> 03:03:33,860
for like the Mediterranean I can't lose like that that's fucking lame yeah really I was seriously

929
03:03:33,860 --> 03:03:51,420
was almost exactly where that was and then you lose the whole thing oh yeah that was bad I just

930
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:56,700
had been holding a two-handed sword over my head just queuing it up charging it I let it go and

931
03:03:56,700 --> 03:04:05,299
killed you I'm like an hour growing you for that this is the most powerful I've ever been

wrong flag yeah I there were Russian butters I wear that's the wrong flag yeah I know I say

934
03:04:36,389 --> 03:04:40,069
this often but as a well-traveled man I'm pretty sure I've been here before

935
03:04:43,770 --> 03:04:56,700
I stayed in this house Coca-Cola that's actually a big

936
03:04:59,180 --> 03:05:42,180
to me again oh I was closer what's it Aloha like Guam again I keep doing this exaggerated like

937
03:05:42,180 --> 03:05:48,549
annoying hog face I'm probably pissing off so many people they don't know it's exaggerated

938
03:05:49,350 --> 03:06:19,059
I don't know where it is there is I think I fucked up damn that was not bad for like

939
03:06:19,059 --> 03:06:30,420
guessing within five seconds I must go to on Norway how did you guess that close goddamn

940
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:37,659
because I saw nl and I saw the point I didn't see anything I saw like one word and I was like

941
03:06:37,659 --> 03:06:45,020
ah somewhere around here why did I go this way what was wrong with me I was distracted by my own

942
03:06:45,739 --> 03:06:49,340
my own talk this could be a lot of different places unfortunately

943
03:06:49,979 --> 03:07:00,540
I have a feeling you actually I don't know I don't know how I feel like you are not going

944
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:07,909
to be able to I actually feel like I have a weird kind of wild guess here it's not that wild so I

945
03:07:07,909 --> 03:07:21,219
think I'm just going to go for it and see if I can screw you over right okay it's always grease

946
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:50,649
healing round oh dude wild onion trees really are you serious

947
03:07:50,809 --> 03:08:10,420
guys you did what you just clicked random place in the middle of Russia well I'm not I'm not going

948
03:08:10,420 --> 03:08:44,950
to get like a bigger clue by spending more time I know my limits it's gonna be hard I feel like

949
03:08:44,950 --> 03:09:10,579
it shouldn't be yeah with uh I don't want to say it serious oh shit um um um okay yep

950
03:09:10,579 --> 03:09:19,379
so I had a little bit more time I might have been able to do it

951
03:09:20,870 --> 03:09:25,270
it's always grease it's actually really not a bad place to click because it could be right

952
03:09:25,270 --> 03:09:45,239
in the middle the uh the rooftop very grease I feel like I'm gonna die you're right I just

953
03:09:45,239 --> 03:09:49,639
felt like you were gonna like see something in this city and instantly destroy them like that

954
03:09:50,200 --> 03:10:02,969
yep oh this is so far down into South America are you kidding me really you got there closer

955
03:10:02,969 --> 03:10:30,360
than I did how is uh a football bus I could totally go to school here and then play demons

956
03:10:30,360 --> 03:11:10,100
on my off time such a small road really fucking cool looking actually I was gonna stay Tokyo but

957
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:22,260
I was like there's no way it's like it's Tokyo like every time I mean they must have a higher

958
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:28,860
density of you know you know cars driving around it fuck

959
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:56,500
Jesus you're fucking dead I went too fast I saw Slovenia Slovakia I went too fast I that was

960
03:11:56,500 --> 03:12:01,930
based off the last name on a grave state like I looked over immediately I would have killed

961
03:12:01,930 --> 03:12:09,850
you immediately I just I thought it was blurred out a little it was like it was Slovia god damn

962
03:12:09,850 --> 03:12:17,059
you're dead how does it feel last one okay truly the final one for real it was actually a lot of

963
03:12:17,059 --> 03:12:21,700
fun to do like I I don't think I would enjoy this so much uh single player it is really fun yeah

964
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:31,059
this is the true final one see this game is fun see I told you I got food on the way to okay well

965
03:12:31,059 --> 03:12:34,260
it's like the competitive aspect you're trying to do it in a hurry like the whole just sit there

966
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:40,260
for 30 minutes and pause and be a streamer kind of situation it's not doing it for me he has

967
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:45,700
streamer yeah we're gonna like pause and tell oh wait you know you don't know what you're talking

968
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:49,860
about wait wait wait there's big this this thing you grew up with I grew up with you didn't grow

969
03:12:49,860 --> 03:12:56,840
up with that like that's weird for you so everybody didn't do this one thing that I always did as a

970
03:12:56,840 --> 03:13:31,559
child what you gotta I feel like this is gonna annihilate you main yeah why would they say

971
03:13:31,559 --> 03:13:41,059
Quebec city on it and it's in Montreal uh I don't know I'm surprised that I got so like was was so

972
03:13:41,059 --> 03:13:46,100
competitive with that guess that was like 100 like I have no fucking clue these houses look

973
03:13:46,100 --> 03:13:47,139
look expensive

974
03:13:52,149 --> 03:14:17,209
what I'm learning is that I need to like educate myself and stop being so dumb about

975
03:14:18,170 --> 03:14:45,639
any country that uses this language that's what I've learned today literally only one country

976
03:14:45,719 --> 03:14:49,299
don't tell me that you're making it up

977
03:14:52,500 --> 03:15:00,100
that's great

978
03:15:12,459 --> 03:15:21,030
I was over there too I was right there but like I can't tell

979
03:15:39,559 --> 03:15:47,959
I've got a huge hunch just from what I've seen

980
03:15:49,879 --> 03:15:59,879
where that fucking sign just go no dude really there's no like it's it's something like that

981
03:15:59,959 --> 03:16:15,340
wait yeah shit I gotta I have to guess what were you doing Florida you thought that was Florida

982
03:16:15,340 --> 03:16:21,209
yeah left side cars I don't have a driver's license that does that's not the first thing I

983
03:16:21,209 --> 03:16:48,620
look at Florida it might as well have been Florida all right uh too blurry yeah this one's kind of

984
03:16:48,620 --> 03:17:12,680
looking like Florida too that's too blurry I can't read it's too blurry too I too blurry

985
03:17:25,340 --> 03:17:50,379
it's too blurry I can't read it um um uh I'm just gonna I'm literally just gonna pick I'm

986
03:17:50,379 --> 03:17:58,489
gonna just take it I'm gonna take a guess I'm just guessing yeah I don't think it was that far south

987
03:17:58,489 --> 03:18:34,139
all the signs were all I couldn't read them you don't even know you really don't I really

988
03:18:34,139 --> 03:18:36,540
don't you literally just did that and like now I have to like do this

989
03:18:37,020 --> 03:19:09,100
yeah of course it is of course it's a heal round fucking where did I see this before

990
03:19:09,899 --> 03:19:26,069
oh you are you're fucked really

991
03:19:29,959 --> 03:19:37,510
it's 26 damage to you okay how come the ones that I beat you in I you like are right next to me

992
03:19:37,510 --> 03:20:08,139
they're the easy ones and you can only do the easy ones music is very tense really you really

993
03:20:08,139 --> 03:20:16,059
like light the fire under you I like the hunt for trying to quickly figure out like where the

994
03:20:16,059 --> 03:20:35,610
most information would be I know right desperately desperately searching I don't think I have it

995
03:20:35,610 --> 03:21:10,870
right I thought I did immediately but I don't think so now of course it's your oh look it's

996
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:15,350
next to Paris it's right next to London right next to Paris I got it I saw a road map that was

997
03:21:15,350 --> 03:21:26,840
kind of going that angle and I just tried to pick one I saw a road map you fuck they're always like

998
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:55,020
right next to Paris right next to London right next to like all the major cities who has any idea

999
03:21:56,139 --> 03:22:03,270
vague idea I have a vague idea too but how would you in some architectural

1000
03:22:05,350 --> 03:22:06,649
but also yeah

1001
03:22:31,219 --> 03:22:38,420
you're fucking dead dude honestly you just you and his one isn't happening we're like really really

1002
03:22:38,420 --> 03:22:45,370
close like the first four or five rounds so far away and then the quadruple damage rolls around

1003
03:22:45,370 --> 03:22:50,649
and you're like equally as fucking wrong but you're still you still do quadruple and I'd lose

1004
03:22:50,649 --> 03:22:58,969
so just get a little bit closer again yeah winner takes all winner takes all four million community

1005
03:22:58,969 --> 03:24:14,069
subs all right this is it final one this is for all the marbles let's go yeah I feel like I went

1006
03:24:14,069 --> 03:24:18,389
down the wrong road and I'm never going to see a sign anywhere down here and you're going to

1007
03:24:18,389 --> 03:24:45,639
figure something out soon that I'm not going to know I knew it had to be somewhere like down here

1008
03:24:46,620 --> 03:24:51,020
yeah I was going to put it in Glasgow honestly and then I was like I'm going to put it close to

1009
03:24:51,020 --> 03:25:25,100
the middle in case I'm wrong most improved one turn around turn around turn around turn around

1010
03:25:26,219 --> 03:25:55,879
what I can't read this yeah that's the clue that's how I know where we are shit there's a flag

1011
03:25:55,879 --> 03:26:12,200
right there what is it oh my god it's switzerland what yeah so unlike the fourth round where the

1012
03:26:12,200 --> 03:26:26,329
quad damages what did you even click on where was that Singapore why was there a switzerland flag

1013
03:26:26,329 --> 03:26:30,409
there was a swift there was a flag it seemed like it was near an airport or something

1014
03:26:32,010 --> 03:26:40,489
it was the swiss embassy that's so fucking annoying all right I gotta get it together

1015
03:26:43,319 --> 03:26:49,559
I see the one flag it's like the swiss flag and it's the embassy in Singapore where is this

1016
03:26:50,120 --> 03:27:02,420

1019
03:27:16,069 --> 03:27:21,670

1020
03:27:21,670 --> 03:27:27,450
Montenegro yeah but okay so I turned around and I see like the swiss flag on a building and all

1028
03:28:47,639 --> 03:29:32,860
guest here as humanly possible yeah I think I think I'm gonna be pretty close I mean it could

1029
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:57,450
it I don't it could be anything though hold on if I could click in any faster than this oh come on

1030
03:29:57,450 --> 03:30:12,680
it was Florida it was god it was Georgia and you know it it was not Georgia palm trees I'm a hobbit

1031
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:17,000

1032
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:46,100
don't care I'm like why are you so mad because I got it I thought I had it right he doesn't know

1033
03:30:46,100 --> 03:30:56,469
he doesn't fucking know I'm guessing you just guessed dude really I can guess you're way better

1034
03:30:56,469 --> 03:31:05,020
than you can guess really I don't have any idea I have no idea I actually have absolutely no clue

1035
03:31:05,659 --> 03:31:12,299
oh and apparently I was supposed to see it apparently I was thinking I don't know like

1036
03:31:13,020 --> 03:31:34,420
one of the Carolinas I can't guess good this one has to be Greece imagine you clicked Greece

1037
03:31:59,059 --> 03:32:05,610
I got an idea oh I absolutely have an idea oh you better believe that I have an idea

1038
03:32:06,489 --> 03:32:46,979
fucking sub work from somewhere in NA literally all of these are in NA you're gonna have to narrow

1039
03:32:46,979 --> 03:32:50,739
it down a little bit more than that I think I think it needs a little more narrowing down

1040
03:32:50,739 --> 03:32:59,899
because it could be there's a few places this could be I have yeah but I don't have a lock on

1041
03:33:17,530 --> 03:33:19,370
I pretty much have to just click now

1042
03:33:26,069 --> 03:33:31,829
what the dude the car that we started next to pointing out the red truck that we started next

1043
03:33:31,829 --> 03:33:36,790
to had Pennsylvania on it but there was a church across from a church across from a church

1044
03:33:38,389 --> 03:33:46,090
that's very like up in that area too like all of the east coast is all of the churches

1045
03:34:04,680 --> 03:34:11,899
hey slow down slow down dude come on and if you're not from us like how political all this shit

1046
03:34:11,899 --> 03:34:16,059
honestly is where every single lawn has like vote for this person vote for this person we're not

1047
03:34:16,059 --> 03:34:28,780
seeing that anywhere else this guy had an Obama shirt on what did you get what what do you what

1048
03:34:28,780 --> 03:34:34,809
what kind of genre of food do you have I got this place called Austin Burger Company I never heard

1049
03:34:35,290 --> 03:34:40,409
of it but Boston Burger Company is the best burger I'm hoping I think me and Holly are

1050
03:34:40,409 --> 03:34:57,290
gonna get McDonald's okay that's fantastic there's no there's nothing giving me any information here

1051
03:35:06,489 --> 03:35:11,139
is that a guess or did you see a sign or something we'll see how much of a guess

1052
03:35:11,139 --> 03:35:20,059
it was when we see how close I am I don't know right okay I mean it was the poverty

1053
03:35:20,700 --> 03:35:25,639
I gotta get you right here this is the next round after this I gotta get you

1054
03:35:26,200 --> 03:36:14,069
it's always on the fucking healing rounds okay I always like clean it up on the healing

1055
03:36:14,069 --> 03:36:21,399
seriously like this I would have wiped them out like five times yeah I bet

1056
03:36:21,399 --> 03:36:27,610
you didn't even click on Santa Monica Boulevard by the way I couldn't find the street I like

1057
03:36:27,610 --> 03:37:06,100
didn't even move once I didn't see what cross street was there's no way I lose

1058
03:37:06,100 --> 03:37:11,350
is

1059
03:37:11,350 --> 03:37:19,350
St. Petersburg it was on one of the trash cans oh I don't even know what that is

1060
03:37:20,629 --> 03:37:30,069
okay we're walling in we're walling in citizens by the way how do I click on the like like within

1061
03:37:30,069 --> 03:37:35,049
like five miles of the city and it's triple damage and you still like because I wasn't

1062
03:37:35,049 --> 03:38:11,350
not that far off I think St. Petersburg is in Russia what how do you oh every time it's

1063
03:38:11,350 --> 03:38:17,750
times four damage you you immediately know where to go you're gonna die it's times three by the way

1064
03:38:19,739 --> 03:38:27,659
how the fuck is three how is it even possible you're dead you're gonna have to hold that

1065
03:38:29,020 --> 03:38:32,620
every time or this motherfucker just guesses immediately and gets it right immediately you

1066
03:38:32,620 --> 03:38:38,920
just must know where this stuff is I saw a sign said Louisiana on a mini mart you're just getting

1067
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:45,159
lucky every fourth round every fifth round oh I guess I just keep getting luckier than you

1068
03:38:45,159 --> 03:38:51,500
it was sucked to be so unlucky it's I know it sucks man I'd stop my totally five times one more

1069
03:38:51,500 --> 03:39:02,569
oh I gotta grab my food actually this time yeah all right you run it you look back and you see

1070
03:39:02,569 --> 03:39:06,889
every fifth round every fifth round it's like five seconds to go by and then it's

1071
03:39:17,559 --> 03:39:25,219
do famous places okay that's fun oh we're making this 20 seconds I feel like I have a I feel like

1072
03:39:25,219 --> 03:39:29,379
I have a better chance of beating you if we're in America because Ashley keeps telling me she's

1073
03:39:29,379 --> 03:39:37,909
gonna go on the run and I really practice how to locate her this is famous places in the world

1074
03:39:37,909 --> 03:39:43,610
apparently which good luck I don't think I'm gonna be able to get any of these uh the more famous it

1075
03:39:43,610 --> 03:39:49,030

03:42:11,659 --> 03:42:14,299
I just said fuck you for no reason that was like rude

1086
03:42:25,670 --> 03:42:39,579

1088
03:42:50,899 --> 03:43:12,250
what come on guys is a burger is it good is food good yeah it's pretty good it's whatever this is

1089
03:43:12,250 --> 03:43:34,870
this thing here my connection sucks so I can't even see it's all blurred out how do we both

1090
03:43:34,870 --> 03:43:47,219
get zero I was closer I don't like this one I'm too stupid I don't know anything is that like

1091
03:43:47,219 --> 03:43:59,180
famous um it's a famous uh there's bridge this is not easy is this the London bridge

1092
03:43:59,899 --> 03:44:17,930
let's give it away it is why don't I say that out loud I don't know neither like we're either

1093
03:44:17,930 --> 03:44:29,719
gonna need no one's gonna score points I want a real game okay well um the real question is

1094
03:44:30,360 --> 03:44:37,879
where where are these oh I fucking okay did you get it wrong yeah I put it in Las Vegas

1095
03:44:41,260 --> 03:44:54,120
I don't know where they are though okay yeah it's Cairo did I just kill you yeah so not

1096
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:58,680
the famous pyramids of Egypt are not in Libya no they aren't

1097
03:45:01,510 --> 03:45:05,030
I want to do another real one what you don't want to do a real one not monuments I don't I

1098
03:45:05,030 --> 03:45:09,590
don't like famous places famous places are lame okay I like to support local business

1099
03:45:09,590 --> 03:45:15,750
United States again um oh let's see if you want to yeah all right this is actually the last one

1100
03:45:15,750 --> 03:45:19,350
because I'm starving plus it's getting really late it's been a lot of fun though

1101
03:45:19,909 --> 03:45:47,690
maybe this is United States yo no shit it is is it how's that one place the other place

1102
03:45:47,690 --> 03:46:15,190
the lamer place no no I just I need an extra minute

1103
03:46:17,989 --> 03:46:23,110
that's like we're still doing famous places I that was in my brain for some reason

1104
03:46:25,670 --> 03:46:37,350
I clicked central New Jersey oops the first two rounds don't even matter it's round eight that

1105
03:46:37,350 --> 03:47:03,829
is the only one that matters why are you so mad about that getting a tree this could be

1106
03:47:10,950 --> 03:47:14,389
I know I understand that you're like taking a bite and just guessing randomly

1107
03:47:14,389 --> 03:47:26,329
but yeah but I'm still gonna beat yourself like does it really matter all right we both

1108
03:47:26,329 --> 03:47:29,049
making the same thing I was thinking like Portland

1109
03:47:30,090 --> 03:47:37,370
Linda area you just said you don't even think that these rounds matter yeah but I mean whatever

1110
03:47:49,590 --> 03:47:50,389
yeah that's one degrees

1111
03:48:23,850 --> 03:48:29,530
I know you can't look at license plates that's kind of um cannot that's some NSA level stuff

1112
03:48:29,530 --> 03:48:44,790
so I this actually might be I don't want to say it why does the sun have to be so

1113
03:48:45,829 --> 03:48:49,590
bright every sign I've looked at when you zoom in it's like a pure white sign

1114
03:48:59,129 --> 03:49:06,329
yeah I gotta get I'm getting away from the sun he's using the sun evasion technique

1115
03:49:07,989 --> 03:49:47,450
okay I'm dead end this is such a average place an average city yeah but with like no commercial

1116
03:49:47,450 --> 03:49:56,459
areas so you can't actually see like business addresses or anything like that everything's

1117
03:49:56,459 --> 03:50:38,360
just blown up by the sun I'm going off this way I don't know

1118
03:50:42,969 --> 03:50:49,299
I mean I could I'm just gonna go for it here I mean this round doesn't matter right

1119
03:50:49,299 --> 03:50:52,979
not necessarily none of the rounds matter not until it's four times damage and I win

1120
03:50:54,100 --> 03:51:20,229
okay I was thinking like all right yeah San Diego or whatever I was thinking like

1121
03:51:20,229 --> 03:51:37,959
Paso or El Paso said La Mesa I don't know what that is I'm I like can't move down this road

1122
03:51:37,959 --> 03:52:03,159
yeah it's hard to drive in either direction oh I'm ready to guess this is yeah this is bad

1123
03:52:04,040 --> 03:52:28,709
trying to eat over here oh I see something get closer I'm going for it I just want to get to

1124
03:52:28,709 --> 03:52:37,340
this one building I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm just

1125
03:52:37,340 --> 03:52:55,319
gonna say somewhere like around here this is a lot of trees wow I mean Vermont New Hampshire

1126
03:52:55,319 --> 03:53:07,780
look I mean that's what it looks like during like the spring and summer is that snow or

1127
03:53:07,780 --> 03:53:16,860
solar ash I don't know sir I think it might be solar ash okay then I think I know where we are

1128
03:53:16,860 --> 03:53:52,010
still a shitload of people and it's late I'm surprised I don't know where this would be but

1129
03:53:52,010 --> 03:54:02,299
I'll say like somewhere around here really you thought you saw a sign for St. Louis didn't you

1130
03:54:03,579 --> 03:54:34,620
I did it was a healing room whatever none of the rounds matter easy I got really lucky with that

1131
03:54:34,620 --> 03:55:09,899
St. Louis I had no idea where I was America it's very America it's a little bit too America

1132
03:55:10,780 --> 03:55:27,159
the thing is I don't know where that is I think it's here I'm pretty sure it's like up here

1133
03:55:27,159 --> 03:55:38,090
I think it's like up here I'm like 99.9 percent certain that's like here I'm about to get

1134
03:55:38,090 --> 03:55:56,120
destroyed is it right here or is it like up here yeah Kentucky oh what really yeah that's a lot

1135
03:55:56,120 --> 03:56:01,959
man no I mean on two times damage that was all my life because I pretty much was I literally got

1136
03:56:01,959 --> 03:56:07,209
like almost the exact place yeah I really thought it was up there too but I wanted to

1137
03:56:07,209 --> 03:56:13,110
put somewhere more middle yeah I was very unsure that's crazy we're gonna play one more right

1138
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:18,040
I gotta call it man I gotta go get your you're eating I haven't eaten all day yeah that's why

1139
03:56:18,040 --> 03:56:37,559
we can do one more all right this is the last one real everybody's betting all the doubters

1140
03:56:37,559 --> 03:57:06,819
right you mean you're just so confident and you lose all your points this photo brother lives here

1141
03:57:07,700 --> 03:57:15,819
where can you drive that fast on the highway the speed limit on the highway is that's

1142
03:57:15,819 --> 03:57:21,559
fucking crazy you know where this is I don't know where this is I know the general area

1143
03:57:23,879 --> 03:57:27,399
I'm gonna be closer than you and it's only the first round and you're gonna heal this and like

1144
03:57:27,399 --> 03:57:55,940
my you gotta go so the speed limit in Idaho on highways is 75 so I just said that out loud

1145
03:57:55,940 --> 03:58:00,100
what an idiot I don't know what you said

1146
03:58:11,989 --> 03:58:25,750
wait what they usually say what like first like town or county or whatever

1147
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:43,799
where is that I don't know

1148
03:58:51,909 --> 03:58:54,629
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know

1149
03:58:55,030 --> 03:58:55,530
no

1150
03:58:58,920 --> 03:59:06,090
it looks like Philadelphia like Pennsylvania or something yeah I found out I would have never

1151
03:59:06,090 --> 03:59:18,540
guessed California until I saw the sign I was originally thinking like Georgia it's

1152
03:59:18,540 --> 03:59:23,610
burger something oh this is a hiking trail or whatever that how are we supposed to know what

1153
03:59:23,610 --> 03:59:51,049
this is that's part of the fun noticing some birch looking pretty close to Montenegro again

1154
03:59:51,049 --> 04:00:07,799
I almost want to say it's a dead end at the edge I mean what

1155
04:00:09,639 --> 04:00:20,059
you actually might win right now you find something that I don't

1156
04:00:20,780 --> 04:00:23,420
I mean there's nothing out here I don't think you have to worry about that

1157
04:00:31,430 --> 04:00:35,479
yeah actually I'm at another dead end

1158
04:00:35,479 --> 04:00:51,260
yeah what was sold over here I'm just going for what I would

1159
04:00:51,819 --> 04:00:54,059
I mean I'm just gonna go for it like somewhere like up here

1160
04:00:58,709 --> 04:01:27,379
oh shit I didn't really put Alaska on here I forgot it was a thing what is that

1161
04:01:29,659 --> 04:01:36,459
whoa I've got you too bad it's just a shitty healing round

1162
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:40,760
it's too bad it's just a stupid shitty healing round

1163
04:01:50,010 --> 04:01:55,299
is it do I just kill you I'm closer than you you're closer than me

1164
04:01:55,299 --> 04:02:06,010
bullshit how did you find that out a couple buildings had Hawaiian on it and I picked the

1165
04:02:06,010 --> 04:02:13,430
biggest Hawaiian city because it was a big city which I had no idea Honolulu was that big of a

1166
04:02:14,229 --> 04:02:39,819
city be serious let me break I mean I'm full health you better guess well

1167
04:02:47,670 --> 04:03:10,149
81 double damage it begins you ready this is where it actually matters yeah a lot of cars

1168
04:03:10,149 --> 04:04:10,329
here a lot of endless roads a lot of cars Home Depot here this could be anywhere I mean it could

1169
04:04:10,329 --> 04:04:31,540
be it could be anywhere in this entire country yeah wait you actually got it no you do not

1170
04:04:31,620 --> 04:04:42,620
two times damage are you about to win oh it's Seattle god damn it what Houston

1171
04:04:44,620 --> 04:04:46,780
this space needle was just on there

1172
04:04:54,059 --> 04:04:59,379
that's the space needle right there that's the space needle in Seattle

1173
04:04:59,379 --> 04:05:06,139
does Houston have a space needle too Houston's a pretty big city look at that is the god look

1174
04:05:06,139 --> 04:05:17,799
at this this right here that you can't see it that well but that is the space needle

1175
04:05:17,799 --> 04:05:29,239
that's not a pen that is a needle do you see this thing right here that's the space needle

that's an like an it is actually I see what are you talking about am I crazy that's literally

1177
04:05:40,840 --> 04:05:46,600

1178
04:05:46,600 --> 04:05:57,879
with the needle on top oh come on that's not a pen I think it's an arrow pointing upwards dude

1179
04:05:57,879 --> 04:06:03,510
no it's not that is the space needle okay we'll go back to Houston and find that street and zoom

1180
04:06:03,510 --> 04:06:11,319
in and prove it why would you have the space needle or the stratosphere in Houston as your

1181
04:06:11,319 --> 04:06:21,399
logo uh I don't know how come every single pizza place in New Jersey is a New York pizza

1182
04:06:21,399 --> 04:06:32,069
