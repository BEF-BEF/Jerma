1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:10,419
How you doing? How are you doing? How are you? Good to see you again. You know who I am. Welcome

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:15,300
back to the channel. My name is German on eight five and we've got quite a day for you today.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,250
Tonight got a few things to talk about. We'll go over them one by one really quickly. Already

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:33,640
got a plus two, which means this is funny to somebody. What's up? So we had to change some

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,729
plans today because I originally was going to play GTA online, but I was told

6
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,929
into some research and I was shown a few things. That's just kind of impossible.

7
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,719
It's isn't it apparently one of the easiest things in the world to just like get into a

8
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,579
GTA online lobby and just like break it. So I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that.

9
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,939
Unless there's a different solution on maybe a private server or something. I don't know.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,659
It's apparently very easy to get into games that people are in. There's a lot of like IP problems,

11
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,500
I think, and even just getting into the server itself. People can just kind of get in and

12
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,569
hack. I don't know. I don't know anything about it. It's just, it's apparently hard to do.

13
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:36,170
It's a scary hacker word. A hacker. I don't know. Oh, instead of that, you're a liar.

14
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:45,019
What? This is documented evidence. What are you talking about? I'm a liar. You're a liar.

15
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:57,510
If two cars crash into each other and you ask me, what happened? And I say, although that was a car

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:04,700
accident. Liar. What? It's two cars. That's just factual information sitting in front of you.

17
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:16,310
You're a liar. No, I'm just processing the information. Anyways, if I get another question

18
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,069
mark, I'm ending the stream. It's over if I get another question mark. Just in how it's looking

19
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:30,580
over there and seeing that, how upset that makes me. Question mark, question mark, question mark.

20
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,300
I know what I'm talking about. I'm an adult. I'm 36 years old. I know what I'm talking about.

21
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,310
I don't want to see that anymore. I don't like those question marks. Maybe be unhappy.

22
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:54,650
This sounds fake. It's all fake. Everything is fake here. Except for 5% of the time when it's not.

23
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,610
All right. No more stalling. Let's go. So instead of that, I'm not going to do GTA online. It's not

24
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,210
going to happen. I'll have to figure out something else to do with GTA if I ever do it. I've been

25
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,500
asked to do the last few months now, the last at least couple of months, a couple of Jerma

26
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:18,419
Universe fan games I've shown themselves on Steam. And apparently a couple of them are very much

27
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:24,740
elaborately well made. So I was like, why not? Why don't we check these out? So we're going to do the

28
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:33,219
fan games. And then we'll be back on Sunday as well. I'm going to stream Sunday. And let me tell

29
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:40,620
you, I've been doing some meetings and talking back and forth a few times with different people.

30
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:48,949
There is some exciting shit coming up in the next hopefully six months or so.

31
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:56,939
Some more exciting shit that is currently starting. We're having meetings. There's meetings.

32
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:07,349
You understand? I'm having meetings with people. Community Jake. I'm hopeful there's going to be

33
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:14,340
some really fun shit to do soon. Isn't it Sandy? Yeah. That's what I'm trying. Let's go.

34
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:20,899
I'm very excited today. You probably hear it in the sound of my voice. I am very excited.

35
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:33,589
The horizon is bright. It looks great. So let's just hang out for a little bit. I'll be back on

36
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,990
Sunday. Let's do this. This is Jerma's Big Adventure. The first one we're going to do.

37
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:46,680
This is it right here. I don't know if I need to play this with a controller, but I'm going to.

38
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:53,370
He isn't retiring. Not yet. No, not yet. That's still important work to do.

39
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,579
I'm the ghost that lives in everybody's house. There's still important work to do. I can't leave

40
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:21,350
yet. Not yet. Okay. This is a banger. No, don't call the Ghostbusters. I'm haunting your computer.

41
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,970
I'm not haunting you. All right. You guys ready? This is Jerma's Big Adventure.

42
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:40,819
Go ahead. Okay. Start. You ready? I'm ready. I'm excited. I think this is a side scroller.

43
00:05:48,089 --> 00:06:06,569
I could be, I could be 10 feet tall. All right. Honey, hold E to tell a joke.

44
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,339
Okay. Good. Good. Good. Use A. Do I need to use A? Oh, wait. I could.

45
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:29,129
Oh my God. This is so stupid. Okay. What does it tell a joke? Is there a jump? Hold. Okay. To

46
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:37,189
tell a joke. Okay. Audience loved it. It's got controller support. That's how you know it's,

47
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:47,829
this is a real deal. Is there a jump? There is a jump. Tell another joke. This is so accurate.

48
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,709
Do not enter. Should I go in there? Look how sweaty I was. Hold. All right. Hold.

49
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:09,930
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. He has three jokes. No, four. I walk funny. Is it like, is it like a

50
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:27,990
currency thing? Let me turn this up. Stop. Turn back. Uh oh. Dead end. Do not enter. Fall hazard.

51
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:40,410
Keep out. That's not that high, right? It's not about that high up. Jump in it? Fall joke. Hold

52
00:07:40,410 --> 00:08:03,240
on. Wait, wait, wait. Jerma goes to undertale. Did you see my underwear? What is that?

53
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:21,290
What is that on my stomach? Okay. Apparently I was streaming outside.

54
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,299
I got an achievement. The achievement was actually called fall joke. Somebody liked it. Good. All

55
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:46,039
right. It's your thong. Joke charge meter. Charges with attacks. Tell a joke to heal.

56
00:08:46,519 --> 00:09:04,600
The ooey gooey cheesy. Oh man. Okay. Do I have full health? I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta get

57
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,620
out of here. I gotta get out of here, man. I gotta go. Is this what I'm like? Oh, this is a new

58
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:24,149
movement. This is actually hold to jump higher. Is this like a, is this like a Metroidvania?

59
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:36,539
Should I tell more jokes? Oh, I can't. I love how I'm doing the I'm falling thing every time I jump.

60
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:49,159
Oh, log. Oh, yeah. Loot get. Got it. Now I'm assuming this is my attack. How do I attack?

61
00:09:52,299 --> 00:10:11,429
Right trigger to swing or right bumper. This is crazy. Hold to heal. Okay. So let's keep going.

62
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:25,129
Are there enemies in the game? Do I have to fight actual enemies? Why am I running like this? I'm

63
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:35,779
running like an absolute shithead. Ace wall while falling to grab edge. I promise I don't actually

64
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,100
run like this in real life. I can run actually pretty fast and well press it and hold jump to

65
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:48,440
boost jump off an edge. That's, that's copium. No, I'm serious. I don't run like this. I think

66
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,159
you've probably, you guys have seen me run. I don't run with like my neck out like that.

67
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:03,899
That was definitely for a joke. All right. Duck. All right. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.

68
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:16,299
Checkpoint reached. Are they bosses? Robot dinos danger. I have an ad for Fortnite on my screen

69
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:44,519
right now and I don't even have the raptor. Okay. They have lasers reflect projectile.

70
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:57,110
All right. That onion ring. I got an onion ring. What people already loves that one. What are you

71
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:05,509
talking about? That's like everybody's favorite. They can be bad jokes and I don't get healed.

72
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:15,909
Oh shit. Oh my God. This is actually a video game now. Oh, I can't. Oh, that's how many hits it

73
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:34,659
takes. There we go. All right. Good. You like that one. Marvelous. Ow. Okay. I got six squares.

74
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:44,440
This music too. Listen to this. Like you're already here watching. Why do I have to do that?

75
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,840
Why am I saying? I don't know why I do that. I am the annoying person. I'm sorry. Is it like,

76
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,990
is it like a currency thing? I'm the annoying guy at the movie or in the game that says,

77
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:03,210
Hey, look, you watch this part. I know I'm already doing it. Can you aim it? Can I aim it? Like

78
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:19,659
angle it? I can. All right. Use L and press. Okay. So I can aim the bat up or down. What?

79
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:30,580
This is genuinely a good game. I mean, it kind of is. How many remaining? Oh, I have to kill them

80
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:46,809
all. I see. Oh shit. I swing that way. I don't think I can swing to my left. Can I? I can't

81
00:13:46,809 --> 00:14:00,230
swing left. This is the best game to screen because the game streams for me. I don't even

82
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:16,820
do anything. This is awesome. I barely even have to say anything. Why didn't I do this before?

83
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:27,529
All right. Here we go. This definitely bosses too. I can't wait. It's doing all the old hits.

84
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:41,080
All right. I got to watch out. So that's funny. That's funny. I like that one. That's not minus

85
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,809
two. That's a good one. Oh, I can't. It has to be charged up. I see. All right. All right.

86
00:14:46,809 --> 00:15:03,850
I see. All right. I got to be careful. Pull them down here. There we go. Zonked. You need

87
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,809
more German juice for jokes. Oh, I see. I just get the hitting boxes and stuff. The giant enemy

88
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:26,230
spider. I love this. This is exactly what I'm looking for. Damn it. Head end down. Okay. Where?

89
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,129
Exit. Should I wait? Should I explore? Are there secrets? There's definitely secrets.

90
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:45,480
What am I kidding? Are there secrets? Yep. There it is. There's got to be Easter eggs.

91
00:15:45,480 --> 00:16:01,879
I got to find all the Easter eggs. Did I miss a secret? Is it fall damage? No. It's not Easter.

92
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:15,820
Get at it. Can I go up there? There's a little divot right there. Can I go up here? Oh, I can go

93
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:29,899
up here. So what is this? Okay. This is all this caution symbols. What does that mean?

94
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:43,820
Exit. Exit. Exit. Exit. How do I get up there? How do I get up there? This is, I'm telling you,

95
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:58,820
this is a Metroidvania. I can't make it from here. Holy shit. Okay. That works. You go so much further

96
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:08,950
when you do a roll. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I'll get it. Is there a double jump? No, the roll jump works.

97
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:19,690
That's a Donkey Kong strat. Oh, come on. Do I have to get out of the roll to grab the edge?

98
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,119
Yeah. You have to get out of the roll to grab. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Wait,

99
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:45,000
wait, wait. There we go. You can't be rolling. All right. What do I get? Okay. All right. Somebody

100
00:17:45,000 --> 00:18:02,859
liked that. Good. That was worth two funny points. Head to the exit. All right. Cool. Cool. Now what?

101
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:25,319
Robot dinos again. Oh, I have to activate all these with lasers. Oh shit. Okay. Can I flip it?

102
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:38,250
No. I hit that one. Thank you. Oh God. I did it. That's exactly what I had to do. Right here. Come

103
00:18:38,250 --> 00:19:00,440
here. Up here. Keep going higher. Do to me up here. No, I'm not going to kill the raptors and

104
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:16,019
softlock myself. Fuck. I actually might've just ruined it. Oh, I got it. Oh, get out of here.

105
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:40,759
Shoot. Oh my God. He actually hit me. Any more there? Right here. There's only one more, right?

106
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:59,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You shoot up here. Wait, I can, I can deflect it. Does it

107
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:10,950
count? Oh, it does. Okay. I thought it turned to green. Do I need to kill them? I think I can

108
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:33,099
just leave. I don't want to miss the EXP. Secret. Is there one here? I, okay. That's not me saying

109
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:48,390
yeah, right? That's somebody else. I think I can get up there. No, no, I can't. It's not, that's not

110
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:56,569
me. Oh, there are warlocks now. And you know what? I guarantee I know what it is. I guarantee it's

111
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:02,259
going to be when I had the Harry Potter stuff on. It's definitely Harry Potter. Yep. It's going to

112
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:43,799
be the shock warlock. Is he stunned? How do I even react to this? This is so bizarre. It's,

113
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:53,049
it's so cool though. God, I would have loved to be like a warlock. You know what I mean?

114
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:10,579
I know he's high again. What do you mean? What? I don't know. If like magic was real, it'd be cool

115
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:19,450
to be like a warlock. I don't want to be the guy with the axe that runs up to people. Everyone's

116
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,009
like, oh man, I would be like a melee. No, no. What the hell is wrong with you? I mean, you can

117
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,690
have like, you can conjure demons and like stay at a distance and shoot shadow bolts at people.

118
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:35,099
Why the fuck would you ever want to have an axe in your hand? That's horrible.

119
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:52,440
Why can't you be both? You don't have skill points. Are you serious?

120
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:09,420
Hold on. I'm going to die. I'm going to die here. I'm going to die here. So what happens when you

121
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:24,970
die? What to menu? No restart from the checkpoint. Let's go. 5,000 hours in Isaac, by the way.

122
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:37,799
Yeah. Over the course of 10 years. Okay. During the smite scream, we already went over this.

123
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,839
You, if you are not actively playing a video game, you, it takes like weeks to get back into it and

124
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,980
get back to where you were. It's like, it's like the gym. You can't just stop going to the gym.

125
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,670
Yeah. I also used to be like 170 pounds of pure muscle, a stack of absolute shit and I was

126
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:09,509
unstoppable. I now like see my stomach when I take a piss now. That's just a fact. What? I,

127
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:30,920
just because I worked out before, I couldn't do it right now if I wanted to. I love these.

128
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:39,420
I love the warlock. All right. Let's heal. Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.

129
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:51,420
How did you speed that up? That didn't need to be sped up. No, don't.

130
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:10,339
Don't kill me. Come on. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Me playing. You should give me extra lives.

131
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,200
Holy shit. I'm going to die. You want to get baked, Dave? Is that what you want?

132
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:33,509
All right. They're, they're all shooting at the same time. God damn it. All right. That's what

133
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:47,509
you got to do. Oh shit. Too many. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't shoot me. Oh,

134
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:54,660
fuck. All right. This is hard. This is hard. All right. This is a hard game. Let's go.

135
00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:08,759
I'll get it this time. I promise you died to the warlocks omega low. No, this is not an easy game.

136
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:33,029
Here we are. Don't ever melee the warlocks. You attacked who? What? You attacked my friend who?

137
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:53,130
You attacked my friend. Oh, Malfoy. Okay. God damn it. That's not plus two. Everybody hates that.

138
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:54,809
Everybody hates that.

139
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:27,400
Damn it. See, look at everybody's free. Everyone's saying minus two. See, I told you.

140
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:50,650
Oh, I'm so bad. There it is. All right. This is where I was last time. I don't want to get

141
00:27:50,650 --> 00:28:04,569
messed up again. Don't die here. This is probably going to get so hard. I'm already having trouble

142
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:17,779
in this room. Damn it. They said don't attack melee. I couldn't help it. I'm trying to aim

143
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:37,420
down. Come on. Who's left? This game is really well made. Yeah, it is. I took one look at this

144
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,299
on the screenshots and I was just... This is elaborate. This is very elaborate.

145
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:54,099
Fuck. Don't die to the warlock here. Don't be an idiot. There it is. All right. Let's go.

146
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:22,250
What's up here? Uh-oh. This looks dangerous. Damn it. Dude, that's not me laughing. There's

147
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:40,549
no way that's me. Anything else this way? No. It's supposed to be us. All right. All right.

148
00:29:40,549 --> 00:30:02,950
These are the audience. All right. What's in the top? This is so high. This is expelliarmus for

149
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:44,900
every spell. Oh, shit. This is another way to go. What? I think it's random. Nice. I can't believe

150
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:59,690
it. I can't believe we just shot Otto. All right. So, we got Otto, Giant Rat. How dare they minus

151
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:19,460
two? I think it's random. I think randomly you get a bad one. Very quiet now. I think this is a

152
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:43,980
boss. Is there a checkpoint? Checkpoint? Is it like a currency thing? Casino? Well, I have to go in

153
00:31:43,980 --> 00:32:04,460
here. I would not be mad if I didn't. What is this? Times 10? Times 2. 3x, 4x, 5x. All right.

154
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:14,710
But what am I betting? Inserted funnies. Oh, okay. Let's do 64 funnies. Let's go.

155
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,460
That's triple watermelons. That's triple watermelons. I just got what I was good.

156
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,680
Holy shit. It's 2x. All right. You can't. It has to be a max bet. Otherwise, I'm going to lose

157
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:45,460
everything. Seven. Give me another one. Nice. Oh, that's good. All right. Now I'm at 500.

158
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,910
I'm going to do a low bet because I feel like I'm going to run out.

159
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:15,099
Shit. Oh, that was a 3x. What the fuck? All right. I'm on a hot streak. Let's go. Oh, yeah.

160
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:20,819
Let's go. I don't think I can lose. I think it's rigged. This shit is rigged. I can't lose.

161
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:38,220
Bar? That's another bar. All right. I lost that one. That's a good. All right. Look, I made money.

162
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:59,079
It's a diamond. Three diamonds. Let's see it. Goodbye. I win. I'm done. That's 5x. All right.

163
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:07,799
One more. A thousand. Then we're done. That's it. I'm done after this. Give me the seven.

164
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:17,380
I'll take fruit. I'll take fruit. All right. I'm out of here. I'm out. I made over a thousand funnies.

165
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:33,820
I'm good. I'm done. Let's go. Yeah. I came in here with like 300. I'm leaving with 1500.

166
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,250
Oh, is that not a win? It doesn't matter what you went up. It doesn't matter if you don't go down.

167
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:59,510
Uh-oh. The giant enemy dinosaur.

168
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:20,940
What do I do? Select? Oh, shit. All right. Can I go down? It's not like Bowser, right?

169
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:51,539
Shields down. Wait, it's just. Oh, fuck. There's like multiple phases. Oh, man. This is not as

170
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,739
just self-expl... Oh, my God. All right. Hold on. I can stop talking.

171
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:31,139
Come on. All right. Out, out, out, out, out, out. The ads. Watch out. Does that hit them too? It does.

172
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:56,630
Okay. Good. Juggle. Just keep them juggled. Oh, this is bad. Okay. I got to hide.

173
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:11,369
Hold them one at a time. If I get hit like three or four times, I'm going to die.

174
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:32,820
Hmm. Shit. All right. We're fine. One more and we're good. That is it. Boss dead. Nice.

175
00:37:33,940 --> 00:38:05,190
Does it explode? This is just what a regular stream is. I'm kind of realizing. Like it's press

176
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:12,869
X to fill dead air with various noises. I should have really said anything in like a few minutes.

177
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:29,880
It's just ways to keep you engaged. Wait, don't break them all. It's probably a secret somewhere,

178
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:50,280
right? Why would they put all these here? Yeah, I knew it. What's up here? I'm the rat. You need

179
00:38:50,280 --> 00:39:08,409
to jingle the keys. We're children. That's fine. Reward. What's wrong with my guy? Truth. Truth.

180
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:31,099
What's the truth? You've done very well, young one. You've proven your strength to me. Perhaps

181
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:38,500
it's time to reveal my true identity.

182
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,579
Your grand. You're going down. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey. The secret is this.

183
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:43,960
I didn't press anything. Happy birthday. Oh, thanks. Secret about your father and

184
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,239
grandfather is that they are both here to celebrate along with the birthday of rats.

185
00:40:48,219 --> 00:41:17,190
Let's go to the party. Jeremy. I'm so sweaty in that middle one. Nice. Very nice. No, it's not.

186
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:35,900
The stream is still live. It's not over. The stream is not over. 1586. Final time. 27 minutes.

187
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:44,219
Plus you played the slots. It's now that it's the best stream. All that gambling

188
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:56,699
paid off. There was a big adventure. A game by Warbler based on German985, the Spiegei.

189
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:21,369
Wait, truth ending two. Truth ending one. What does that mean? Complex. Very cool.

190
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:30,780
But with Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Audition. Oh, if I actually hit them,

191
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:41,340
you could kill them for the chips. All right. Can we see the other ending? I want to see the

192
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:54,360
other ending. That was so cool. Oh, look out for a wacky behind the scenes video. I wonder if that's

193
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:10,860
there. Thanks for playing. I want to see the other ending. Let's go. New game. Can I speed run it?

194
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:22,699
Wait, wait a minute. Oh, nice. Okay. I want to start from the post-boss region with no,

195
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:31,400
with zero points. What a psycho mode. All right. Well, I want to see the other ending first.

196
00:43:32,199 --> 00:44:01,510
Okay. The other ending is to hit them and get the chips. Let's see what we get.

197
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:16,280
I can skip the cut scene. Okay. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to see.

198
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:36,550
Wait, what? No damage. I didn't mean, I didn't need to. Okay. Hold on. This is very sad ending.

199
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:50,630
All right. Hold on. Let me do that again. That was the ending. Was that? No, it wasn't.

200
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:57,369
Let's go. Okay. New game. From that checkpoint. I'm going to hit them.

201
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:09,000
Start with, we'll start with $300. Okay. Go. There's more to it. I swear. Okay.

202
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:36,550
I was from the dev's mouth. Okay. I'm ready. We're going to kill the grandfather and go get chips.

203
00:45:37,110 --> 00:46:09,659
You've done well. Okay. We can fill the dead air. You dog. I jingled the keys. Yes.

204
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:14,250
Let's kill him.

205
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,699
TV rovo.

206
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,980
You want to know about your father. I kind of want the chips.

207
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:19,929
Wait, this, this is a different outro. 300 funnies. Okay. Final time plus checks.

208
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:31,590
Average stream. That's fine. That's all right. That's fine. I don't have to be best dream.

209
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:48,099
Try psycho mode. Yeah. I'm definitely going to try psycho mode. All right. I'm going to do psycho

210
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:59,400
mode. Should I just start from the beginning? Let's go. New game. Okay. Psycho mode. New

211
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:11,239
conquest. So what's the difference? Welcome to episode one of German psycho adventure.

212
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:31,619
Screaming. I already have the bat. Okay. I've got a raid come in too from a J six.

213
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:40,500
Still was. Thanks a lot. Welcome everybody. I'll sing the rain. So the rate song. Sure.

214
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:49,880
Thanks for coming. Playing a couple of games that some of the community members have made.

215
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:57,320
And this is not, we're in psycho mode. I have glasses on. Is this a whole new game?

216
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:08,170
What's the difference? Oh shit. This is a different game. That other one was just

217
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:24,440
practice for this. Oh my God. Freddy dread is give 50 community subs. Freddy, what do you

218
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,090
have to write? Are you giving 50 subs? Wait, Freddy, give it all these subs.

219
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:35,130
Why he give it all these subs, right? That's a shit load. Welcome everybody.

220
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,809
What do you mean welcome? Like you've given a sub. You weren't here before.

221
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:44,300
I combined the raid and the sub. Well, some of you that just rated might not have,

222
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,139
maybe you have one. Maybe you got one of the drops. The giant enemy spy.

223
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:55,349
Thanks a lot. Freddy's here. That's a lot of money already. He's coming in hot.

224
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,469
Hope you're doing well, Fred. And I just called you Fred. Are we on those terms yet? And I call

225
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:22,469
you Fred. Loose. I just jumped in. You just made it awkward. No, I didn't. I've hung out with

226
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:40,760
Freddy Fred in real life. Okay. It's not awkward. We know each other. Oh my God. Now he's just

227
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:53,929
flexing. You don't know Freddy like I do. We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night.

228
00:50:53,929 --> 00:51:02,460
We stalk at night. We're the rats. I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.

229
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,460
Let's see what kind of trouble we can get our Sims into.

230
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:20,340
So what do they do? Oh, I haven't spotted. Nice. I'm just like a psycho on the loose.

231
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,849
Now I'm really curious as to how this ends. We were on baby mode before.

232
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:41,449
Now we're in the real game. That was just a tutorial. Oh, this makes me want to install

233
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:45,800
Hollow Knight. Tell everybody I'm going to play it and then fucking play it for an hour

234
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,880
and then never play it again. I just want to play that now, but only for like an hour

235
00:51:49,880 --> 00:52:12,059
and then never play it again. I think I got the hang of this. This actually looks fun. This is fun.

236
00:52:25,429 --> 00:52:31,179
I wish he would do the doi doi doi again. All right. Just for you. I'll do it again.

237
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:37,659
I'm going to do a big one. Is he going to rival any of the doi doi dois I've ever done on this

238
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:46,440
channel? He's laughing at his own joke. I'm laughing at what the guy said on camera on

239
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,960
the screen. That was funny. It wasn't even me. That's a different, that's a character that I

240
00:52:49,960 --> 00:53:05,239
played. It's not me. That was for that one person. Oh, fuck. Watch out. Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

241
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:26,889
I do laugh at my own jokes. Yeah. I think, I think I'm the funniest damn person.

242
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:35,860
I actually kind of don't. I laugh at other people's interpretations of the things that I say.

243
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:42,420
That's what makes me laugh more than anything, I think. And people making stuff like this.

244
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:54,579
Holy shit. He's big. I can't wait till I, well, not to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not, I can't wait.

245
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,500
Let's rephrase that. I was going to say, I'm looking forward to eventually when I'm done

246
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,260
streaming. I'm not looking forward to that. Like, let's hold on. I got to, how do I phrase this?

247
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,860
When I eventually am not streaming anymore and I'm one of those people that does like a comedy

248
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:26,420
course at college, I can't wait to do a comedy course. Teach like once a week. Humor, humorist.

249
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:37,429
German985 teaches kids at the local, I don't know, like local state school. I'm definitely not good

250
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:42,599
enough for anything besides just like a, like a two year school. Nobody wants to bring me in

251
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:57,239
for like a, like a four year school. Nope, it won't happen. I'm not prestigious enough

252
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,280
for their, for their big, big, wonderful, like four or five year master's program.

253
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:09,059
Fuck you out of here. You don't need that. You come to my, you come to my class and you'll learn.

254
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:21,110
Comedy instructor. Yep. And the first day of class, I'm going to come in in a costume

255
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,659
and I'm not going to introduce myself. I'm going to make like noises and like get on the table

256
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,300
on top of the, like where the desk is and be like making elephant sounds and shit and like

257
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,820
lying on my back and like scratching my ears like a dog and stuff. And then I'm going to get up.

258
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,780
I'm going to take all the costumes off and I'm going to say, those of you that didn't take notes

259
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:54,980
on what just happened, get up and leave the class. Serious people only. We'll have you pick something

260
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:07,300
else. You're just getting fired. Like I wouldn't even show up to class half the time. I would just

261
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:13,539
forget. It's like 30 students just sitting there waiting in the like lecture hall. I'm just not

262
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:21,769
there. Can I say the same shit that I say to you guys? Oh yeah. I auto had to go out. So I'm not

263
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:32,550
streaming today. What? Yeah. I had to take my dog out. Sorry. It's been six hours. Um, okay.

264
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:47,989
So you've lied. No, I've never lied. Actually, I had a tweet lined up. Uh, it was, it's in my

265
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:52,389
drafts right now. Uh, let me read it to you. Let me read you precisely the tweet.

266
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,860
Tweet says, and I didn't send it cause I was like, no, I, I want to stream today

267
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:06,420
because I did, this did happen. So the tweet says this, I wrote this, um, last night.

268
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:15,769
Hey guys, no stream tomorrow. I hurt my balls yesterday. I accidentally smushed them.

269
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:21,960
I'll let you know when I'm coming back. I was just wasn't going to stream today,

270
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:28,329
but I did smush my balls though. That's not a lie, but I was like, no, I'll be okay. I can,

271
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:37,099
I can do it. But yeah, I was going to cancel the stream today because I smushed my balls

272
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:45,739
and I was like, is it worth it? Canceling the stream for people to see that. Maybe they'll be

273
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:50,760
worth it. Maybe you think it was funny. I don't know. I was like, no, I want to, I want to stream

274
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:02,360
even if it's for a little while. We didn't now, but I'm live right now. No stream tomorrow.

275
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:23,059
Oh, I got to pay attention. We didn't now. You plan on streaming tomorrow? No, but that was

276
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:29,460
because I was planning on not streaming today. But then I had this other epiphany in my brain

277
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,820
and look, listen to me. So those of you that have been following this channel for a long time,

278
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,570
been here for a while, years, a lot of you, which first of all, that's crazy. I'm like

279
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,889
surprised every day that people still watch this and still think that

280
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:51,610
stuff like that is still funny to you. But if you've been watching and noticing the sus

281
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:58,170
over the last three or four years, anytime I ever plan to do, oh, hey, I'll be, I'll be live like

282
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:03,210
Monday or Tuesday. Yeah, I'll be live on maybe like, I don't know, Saturday, Sunday. If there's

283
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:08,090
within three or four days of time ahead of that stream, it's guaranteed to be the next day.

284
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:16,760
If you see me right Monday or Tuesday, the stream is on Wednesday every time. So even though I

285
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,360
smushed my balls, I was like, no, I can't, no, I'm not going, I'm not delaying to Wednesday.

286
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:28,309
Nope. I don't care how smushed they are and make no mistake. They're painful. It's painful,

287
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:52,570
but I was not going to do that again. Oh, I don't know. Then it just had happened. Okay. I'm not

288
00:59:52,570 --> 01:00:03,110
going to give you specifics of how it just did. Sometimes you sit down too fast or too weirdly.

289
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:07,900
Oh, you turn a weird way where you're sleeping or sometimes you, you fall.

290
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:28,070
I'm laughing at somebody said he paid somebody to do it. Sorry guys. I can't stream tomorrow.

291
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:38,679
I had somebody come over and smush my balls. That makes that tweet. No, no, no, no. Okay. All right.

292
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,579
We've got to move on from this, but just know, just know the stream was almost canceled today.

293
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:52,949
People are writing like, huh? Just relax. It's fine. Everything's going to be fine.

294
01:00:53,750 --> 01:01:09,210
Was it left or right? It's both. How is not the question. The question is it did is the question

295
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:16,250
is, is right? No, no, no. It's not the, it's not the how it's the why it's not the why either. It's

296
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:25,289
the, it's the who, what, when it's the, when it was last night or tonight, whatever, whatever it

297
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:37,860
was. I don't remember. It's the, it happened. It's is it did. It's not, I'm not tiny. I'm compact.

298
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:46,500
The only information you have to have is there was a, I got smushed somehow and that's it.

299
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,559
You just dug yourself a grave. It did. You never cease to impress that.

300
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:04,230
I mean, how you, it's all fine. It's not, there's no who it's, it's not a who it's, it is. All right.

301
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:09,369
Get out of here. Man, everybody that says smush time out. Everybody that says the word smush.

302
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:30,820
And then that's it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to kill them.

303
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,849
Oh, thank, thankfully they planned for that.

304
01:02:34,489 --> 01:03:02,980
Hit it. This is the, this is the lesson here. This wait, this is no, no, no. This whole thing

305
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:09,179
did not turn into a routine where I'm still the professor at the college. This actually happened

306
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,059
somebody thinks that I'm talking about like being the professor still.

307
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:33,139
This is not like the lesson plan. I gotta hit it up. Damn it. There we go. How many more are there?

308
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:57,639
Episode. I was taking notes. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. No, we're good. Shit. Is it one more?

309
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,579
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Shit. Oh my God.

310
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:16,920
He's aiming down. Oh my goodness. Okay. I gotta get up top first. Let's be on the test. There are

311
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:26,619
no tests in my classroom. Everybody has to do a performance. There are no tests. You have a five

312
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:32,329
minute piece or 10 minute piece you have to do at the end of the year. And then I am the sole judge

313
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:56,019
if it was funny enough for you to pass the class. Is it? Shit. You're a cool professor.

314
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,500
That's what I'm going for, man. I want like a cool, I want to have that cool professor vibe.

315
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:21,179
Shit. All right. I have to pay attention. I'm not paying attention. Okay. Now right here. Fuck. Oh

316
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:27,139
my God. All right. I don't get an A. My mom is going to send me to the glue factory.

317
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:35,380
I feel like we mean to go to work. What do you mean? You're going to go to the glue factory?

318
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,940
Oh, okay. Okay. We're going to, I'm going to go to the fact. Oh, okay.

319
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:14,599
Shit. I suck. I suck at this. I gotta move. Just move. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

320
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:43,500
No, you fuck. Holy shit. Okay. I need to, I got to heal. Holy God. Did I get it?

321
01:06:43,500 --> 01:07:03,849
Is it one more? Shit. Come on. I need to heal. I think is it more? Oh my God. Jesus. Oh, I got it.

322
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:22,739
I got it. I got it. This is the weirdest class I've ever been to keep distance from warlocks.

323
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:37,750
I can kill them if I do one hit. Nice.

324
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:50,920
When's the parent teacher conference? You don't have those as a college professor.

325
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:56,010
I just show up and I do my lesson plan and then I just leave.

326
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:17,130
This is a full heel. Oh, I'm going to need it now. Oh my God. What are you a professor in comedy?

327
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:31,350
These teachers suck. He's playing video games, all class and you eat in class. Yes. As long

328
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:36,140
as it's not crunchy. You can eat whatever you want. As long as you're not going to make any

329
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:45,979
crunch mouth sounds. And if it's chewy, chew with your mouth closed. I don't want to hear the like,

330
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:51,739
the chewy shit. Crunchy is loud. Chewy can be loud if you open your mouth.

331
01:08:52,460 --> 01:09:15,880
Slurping is fine. No, if you can eat quietly, you can have it. Nothing crunchy and no loud bags

332
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:24,920
either. I don't want to hear that. It'll distract me. No, don't bring like Lays potato chip bags

333
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:35,899
and you're going to crinkle up. No, don't do that. You're going to bring the smelliest food

334
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:45,420
imaginable. No, you can't have that either. It can't be crunchy. It can't be chewy. It can't smell

335
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:54,489
and it can't be hot because that's a hazard. You can't have like a bowl of spaghetti in the

336
01:09:54,489 --> 01:10:04,260
room because what if you drop it on somebody? It burns them or something. That'll make a mess. Yeah,

337
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:15,659
no. Pop tarts. Pop tarts are absolutely perfect. Yogurt. That's really good. That'd be okay.

338
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,649
Pop tarts, crinkle. No, not if you're quiet. If you tear it right at the top and you make

339
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:37,420
it really silent, it doesn't make a loud noise. It's very light foil. There's three more of these

340
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:46,090
guys. Where are they? Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. What if it's for comedy? It better be really funny.

341
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:58,729
If you're doing a look at I have a loud potato chip bag routine, it better be really funny. I

342
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:07,140
fart in my chip bag. That might be funny. Where do you do this? Do you do it like you just come

343
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,180
up and say, excuse me, I need to interrupt the class and then fart into your bake lays?

344
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:22,840
Okay. Yeah, that's funny. See? I mean, I would tell you to sit down. I'd be like, all right,

345
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:39,449
now sit down. You little shit. Can you order a pizza to the class? No, unless it was, but here's

346
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:45,739
how you would do that. You would be absent. And so one of your peers that's also in the comedy

347
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:50,140
class would be like, I'm going to order a pizza. You would order the pizza. I would have marked you

348
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:57,000
absent. You would show up 20 minutes later in a pizza guy outfit, delivering the pizza to the

349
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:14,199
class. I would give you a, I would give you a stamp on that one. It has to be pepperoni with

350
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:18,149
cheese. Well, then you would know that's my favorite pizza. So you get, you know, points with the

351
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:27,340
teacher. And then if you got into the class and you had the bag of lays and right. And when you

352
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:33,420
got in, okay. So you, that the pizza delivery is called, you show up, you say, Oh, somebody

353
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:37,739
ordered pizza. And it's like, Oh, there he is. This is the absolute, this is the absent guy.

354
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,260
And you immediately grab a full bag of bake lays and you just fart directly into it.

355
01:12:41,979 --> 01:12:46,779
I think that would probably give you an egg that combines both things you're talking about.

356
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:10,119
Now that person passed, they don't have to come to class anymore. That person doesn't need to

357
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:22,060
come to class. I'm just going to give you an egg. But if you come to class in a fursuit,

358
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:34,819
um, it's probably probably kind of hot in there. And as long as I could verify that it was you,

359
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:46,119
I don't know what your routine is. Okay. No, no. Okay. If you had an anthro con badge on

360
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,720
around your neck and it was you like, you came to the wrong place. If you're like, okay, that's

361
01:13:53,720 --> 01:14:04,090
funny. You would pass and you could leave. Oh, fuck, watch out. Is it, is it like, is it like

362
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:21,140
a currency thing? I mean, he knows I just, cause I know it exists. I told you guys what I wanted

363
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:29,140
to do one day. I've never done it. I wanted to dress up in a full fursuit and just go and just

364
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:37,750
blend in and not have no one have ever know it was me. I would be in my hotel room is the only

365
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:44,260
time I would ever take off that costume. I would not talk. I would not tell anyone. No one would

366
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:51,380
ever know. I would just have to make sure that when I got in the hotel room, it was nobody else

367
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:57,800
with me. All the, everything's closed. All the blinds are closed. Everything is closed. Nobody

368
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:06,760
can, it is impossible. I would, I would leave my cell phone. I would leave my cell phone at home.

369
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:21,100
That couldn't get fucking tracked. Nothing. Nothing. Just go. It would be a big elaborate

370
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:33,399
costume. There's no way you could ever find out. You know, don't say swears. What would be the

371
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:44,890
point of it if nobody found out? You failed. Hand in your syllabus and hand in your fucking comedy

372
01:15:44,890 --> 01:16:14,619
token. Sorry, you failed the class. Comedy tokens. One star on Rape My Professor.

373
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:25,449
No way. I would have five. I would be at least 4.5. You're telling you to, okay, hold on a minute.

374
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:30,250
You're saying that if you had a class that you just had to impress the professor for like a

375
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:35,449
minute and you got an A and you didn't have to go anymore and this guy lets you eat food in class

376
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:40,920
and all he cares about is you doing a little comedy routine and then he passes you.

377
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:48,899
You don't have to go anymore. Are you serious? I feel like that you would be full of five star

378
01:16:48,899 --> 01:17:12,279
reviews. What an ego. How much is the class? Good question. How much would the class be?

379
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:23,899
I feel like it definitely wouldn't be free, but it wouldn't be expensive.

380
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:37,640
It would be like the cost of going to see Cirque du Soleil in the back row.

381
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:50,310
Maybe 40 bucks? 30 bucks? How much does Cirque du Soleil take you? Is it expensive? I thought

382
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:58,899
it was like 40 bucks to go see Cirque du Soleil. 32 bucks? Is it more than 100? Oh my god, I have

383
01:17:58,899 --> 01:18:14,979
to heal. I just got headshot. Fuck. Okay, I wasn't paying attention. Fuck. All right, let me just

384
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:29,340
beat this first and we'll talk more about this stuff. You're worth Cirque du Soleil money? I mean

385
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:36,869
it's how much is it for like a class in college right now? It's just way too fucking expensive.

386
01:18:37,670 --> 01:19:00,810
Depends. How much is a front row seat at Cirque du Soleil? I wonder. Maybe it's probably like

387
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:15,960
four or five hundred bucks for like a front row seat. 500? Fuck. All right, about 350.

388
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:36,439
Usually around 1 to 2k. Holy shit, really? Oh my god, I'm getting juggled. Stay back here and heal.

389
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,859
All right, let's go. The giant enemy spider.

390
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:49,699
Why would wearing a fur suit be hot? Do you think furries are hot? Are you a furry now? What is,

391
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:55,140
why is, what? Is it my turn? Like, I'm talking temperature wise. It'd probably be pretty

392
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:09,859
toasty in there. Oh, Darkest Dungeon 2 comes out, right? In like four or five days?

393
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:27,500
When does that come out? I want to play that. Changing the topic. Yes, it's a topic I care

394
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:44,729
very deeply about. This shit is bouncing. That's what's going on. Oh my god, Jeremy, come on.

395
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:54,250
All right. Well, it's not a change of subject. We were done with that other subject and I moved

396
01:20:54,250 --> 01:21:02,039
on to a new one. I didn't change the subject. I went to another topic because we were done with

397
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:19,289
the first one. Oh my god, you got greedy. We were not done? What do you mean? You want to go back

398
01:21:19,289 --> 01:21:41,659
and talk about my smushed balls? I don't. Shit. Oh my god. Watch out. That was actually kind of scary.

399
01:21:44,729 --> 01:22:06,250
Oh god. Oh, get back up here. Way too many. Get rid of the big one. All right. Now I can go down.

400
01:22:08,739 --> 01:22:20,489
Oh, shit. He got hit by that on the way back. I think that's it down here.

401
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:43,380
Is this game canon? It's in the German Extended Universe. Whoa.

402
01:22:54,789 --> 01:23:11,779
All right. Only one more. One more magician. All right. That's it. Welcome to episode one of

403
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:22,939
Germacraft. Are there any non-canon streams? Oh, the smite ones. Is this a secret? Did I miss it?

404
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:33,300
No, we've already seen it. This is just Psycho mode. I already got to the top of this before,

405
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:39,140
right? Did I do it again? I mean, might as well. Did I miss something?

406
01:23:55,659 --> 01:24:07,699
Chad, Germa isn't canon. Yeah, I mean, yeah, he is. I said smite. Well, smite streams are not canon.

407
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:19,909
I think a canon stream is the ones that, you know, the big projects probably. Those are all

408
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:31,529
canon. We got 20 community subs? Affmeric, thanks for the 20 community subs. Appreciate it. Thank

409
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:41,609
you. Thanks for 20 subs. Two zero. Are you going to put an edible in the Germa rumble? Oh no,

410
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:48,279
that's not what you said. I don't know why I read that like that. As a character?

411
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:57,449
Oh, damn it.

412
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:13,340
There we go. Is there anything up here? What about the JCU, the cinematic universe? Yeah,

413
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:30,460
sure. Hey, Neer, thanks for the eight. You know how we say it here. Say it with me.

414
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:36,439
Community subs. Everybody says it and we all like laugh. It's all thing we do.

415
01:25:37,000 --> 01:26:04,649
I'll give immunity. It's Otto. I love Otto. All right, we're getting to the end of the

416
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:21,560
Psycho blog. I think I've done pretty well. All right. Watch it. What the fuck are you doing?

417
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:48,979
What is he doing? He killed Otto in Resident Evil 8. What are you talking about? Stop being greedy

418
01:26:48,979 --> 01:27:04,949
and get him. You idiot. The guy in the big barn. There's a secret boss. Big barn. Oh, I have to go

419
01:27:04,949 --> 01:27:28,579
back to the casino. Whoa. Oh my God. I'm not going to die in here. Am I? What the fuck? No,

420
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:36,649
I can't do this. Fuck, I didn't finish the joke and now I'm going to die.

421
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:54,180
Fuck. Oh my God. I can't. What the hell, man? I can't. No. How far back is the checkpoint?

422
01:27:54,180 --> 01:28:00,710
Oh, thank God. No, wait, is this all the way back to the other room?

423
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:09,590
It's not. Thank goodness. All right. Well, I can't gamble. I'm not going to get killed.

424
01:28:20,949 --> 01:28:51,270
Casino. All right. Fine. No, I can't. What is it? Lemon. Lemon. Lemon. Oh, fuck. Never mind.

425
01:28:51,270 --> 01:29:27,670
We're going right by it. Okay. Get away from me. I don't know how the final boss changes.

426
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:35,289
No. All right. The giant dinosaur. Holy shit. This is going to be so hard. I'm going to stay

427
01:29:35,289 --> 01:30:24,069
down here. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm staying here. I just cheese this encounter. What? Run, run,

428
01:30:24,069 --> 01:30:56,100
run, run, run, run, run, run, run. I bring them over here. I get them over here. All right. One

429
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:00,500
more time. And then that's it. And then I get the true, true ending, but there'll probably be two

430
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:18,020
different endings, right? Oh, flying. What the fuck was that? Oh shit. Oh my God. Just hide down

431
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:27,770
here. Is it like, is it like a currency thing? I didn't get it. All right. I'll get it. Shit.

432
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:55,979
This is bad. This is really bad. This is really bad. Where are the dinosaurs gone? Where are they?

433
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:22,229
Did they fall down? All right. I win. This doesn't seem like I can't move. Can they shoot me? All

434
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:31,859
right. Oh, I just got feeding frenzy too, to run on my laptop. Holy shit. That's a celebration

435
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:58,779
moment. This is not smite. No, it's fine. It's fun. All right. I can still get the, uh, hold on,

436
01:32:58,779 --> 01:33:02,390
break this, but don't kill everybody. They kill these people, but don't break the boxes.

437
01:33:12,619 --> 01:33:31,100
Shit. Hold on. God damn it. Get out of the way. Is this the guy that beat Spampton,

438
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:51,859
Jevil, and Jerma Dinosaur first try? It is. I'm just going. All right. Here we go. I'm going to,

439
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:57,850
I'm not going to kill them. Let's see if we get the true ending and then we'll do the other ending

440
01:33:57,850 --> 01:34:04,069
too. Just to make sure we cover all the bases. I didn't press anything.

441
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:18,579
After his brutal conquest, Jerma obtained the prize chips for real this time.

442
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:52,569
Oh, I get it. Okay. Seven 92. Very cool. I think that's it.

443
01:34:53,369 --> 01:35:08,890
There's another one lined up here to play. That's right. Kevin McLeod

444
01:35:09,609 --> 01:35:16,199
is the master of royalty-free music. Tried to get nine eight five for the secret ending.

445
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:25,880
That accurate? What happens to be getting nine eight five honeys? Can we confirm with the dev

446
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:49,449
that's real? Is it real? You can't cause they're in multiples of two. You can't get an odd number.

447
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:08,250
All right. Well, that was cool. That was from War, War Bill War Brill. Where are you? War Blur,

448
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:22,460
War Blur War Blur stats, brother lowest score. I score locked it fast. I unlocked all these.

449
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:29,479
Oh, I see. It's different modes. That was really cool. I'm going to play the next one.

450
01:36:30,039 --> 01:36:33,000
Next one. I believe the one next one's a point and click adventure game.

451
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:40,680
Okay. Thank you. That was really, really awesome. I think it's called Otto's

452
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:48,970
great adventure or something. Let's do it. Uh, we're also, we'll take a break. I'll go BRB,

453
01:36:48,970 --> 01:40:04,789
go pee, come back, play that one. I'll be right back. I forgot to say I was back. Sorry about

454
01:40:04,789 --> 01:40:22,010
that. Derma and Otto, the curse of the late streamer. Music can stay here. Sound effects.

455
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:31,109
That sounds pretty good. Turn it up a little bit. All right. So this is apparently a point

456
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:39,909
and click adventure game. You do a new game. It's right somewhere in the Nevada desert

457
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:49,880
around 12 to 1 PM Pacific. You have an event. I'm going for the middle class.

458
01:40:50,439 --> 01:41:16,260
That's how it feels. Sometimes. Yeah. This is actually how it is. I'm not even kidding.

459
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:24,649
I'm late for the stream. Chat's going to kill me. That's how it feels. If I know that it's

460
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:29,609
going to take me like 30 minutes to get ready and just like, fuck, they're just probably so

461
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:36,170
trying. They go as fast as I can. I better get over to my computer room as soon as possible.

462
01:41:36,729 --> 01:41:49,699
Okay. So I have a toy. Look at rug. Okay. Use rug. Oh shit. There's a key under here. Give me

463
01:41:49,699 --> 01:42:04,680
that key. I wonder what this opens. Looks kind of dorky. Looks kind of dorky. Get it? Oh shit.

464
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:09,079
I didn't until right now. Door key. Okay. Come on. Adventure games have to have bad puns.

465
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:20,550
Is it in my stomach? This is crazy. Okay. Bad. This is where the magic happens. I'm going to

466
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:33,050
give you a fully voice acted game by the way. You understand? Mirror. Whoa. Who's that handsome

467
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:39,960
hunk staring back at me? You can do this today. You're going to go out there and you're going to

468
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,760
show everyone what you're made of. You're going to show everybody what you're capable of. Not what

469
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:53,859
anyone else is what you are. You have what it takes. This is a map of the cartoon town I live in.

470
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:10,760
Toy blocks. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. What? Use toy blocks. I think they can stay where they

471
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:31,300
are. This is my prize possession. Made with real diamonds. Blue raspberry flavored. It's what?

472
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:39,130
Wait. Eleven? I don't know. I don't think changing the clock is going to make me any less late.

473
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:51,140
Anything else I can do in here? I got a key. I have a diamond pickaxe. Let's go. Headroom door.

474
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:59,420
Outside door. Can I look outside? Reddit room door. Okay. Well, who's on the air? Not me.

475
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:08,069
There's no time for distractions. I've got a stream to start. It's locked. I must have left

476
01:44:08,069 --> 01:44:16,260
the key around here somewhere. This does not happen where I live. Because I would hide this

477
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:19,699
key and forget about it and forget it and have to put a shoulder into the door to get in here.

478
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:32,859
This is... I wouldn't do that. Okay. Here we go. Reddit shit. Holy shit. This is just... This is my

479
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:46,439
room. This is crazy. This is actually one to one accurate. What about the... Can I go in the closet?

480
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:54,600
Reddit shelf. My Reddit shelf is empty. I must have misplaced all my Funko Puffs.

481
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:59,000
I should keep an eye out for them. Sounds like some sort of side mission. That isn't important

482
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:10,180
to the main goal. I'm sure that'll be in the DLC. When does Lenarwall bacon? Epic.

483
01:45:10,659 --> 01:45:33,699
Hahaha. Auto. Cool. Yep. This is also accurate. Dog bed? I wonder where Otto has wandered off to.

484
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:50,020
If I move his bed, where's Otto going to sleep? Rotto Beasts. Yep. You must complete all your

485
01:45:50,020 --> 01:46:01,109
chores before streaming. I forgot to do my chores before stream. Looks like chat might have to wait

486
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:10,060
a minute. I'm sure they won't mind. This is... This is completely accurate. Yeah. Find something

487
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:15,020
to eat. Sandwich does sound good right about now. All I would need is bread, mayo, and steak yum

488
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:21,020
brand meat. That's right. Otto needs to go on a walk. I haven't seen him for a while. I wonder

489
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:27,000
where he went. Of course, I definitely can't stream without internet. Let's check the cable

490
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,170
box outside. See if anything's broken. Okay. So these are the tasks. All right. We're going to

491
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:41,529
take Otto for a walk and find something to eat. Cool. All right. Let's go. Wait. What's this?

492
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:50,090
Otto's note. Otto's note. One. Hey, everybody. It's me, Otto. I'm off on a big adventure right

493
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:56,020
now trying to find who stole the cookies. Are they outside? I should talk to the vroomer.

494
01:46:56,020 --> 01:47:03,140
He's always outside driving his motorcycle up and down the street. Love, Otto. Who stole the

495
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:11,340
cookies? I'm going to find Otto. I've got to find whoever took all the cookies. I should talk to

496
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:24,060
the vroomer. Maybe he knows where Otto is. Okay. So I can go this way now. Use wall. I don't know

497
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:41,220
what good my hands would do against solid stone. Use wall. Oh God. Look at sign. It says

498
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:53,319
VOD watchers skip one hour. Weird. I wonder what that means. Go to door. Go to door on right.

499
01:47:53,319 --> 01:48:18,890
Go to door up. There's only one choice. Go door down. Go door left. Go door left. Go door up. Go

500
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:42,810
door down. Go up. All right. There's a pattern here that I'm missing. Okay. There's two torches

501
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:49,260
on this one. Is that like yes and no? Like one torch is no. Two torches is yes or something.

502
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:54,810
What the fuck am I talking about? What are you talking about? There's more than one door in each

503
01:48:54,810 --> 01:49:27,220
room. What? Oh, this room is no. Okay. What? I don't get it. I don't have any items. Okay. Maybe

504
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:58,680
if a door has two torches on it, it means it's the real one. With one torch, you just go left. Down

505
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:12,329
and left maybe. Torches don't mean anything. I found it. I must have gone the wrong way. I don't

506
01:50:12,329 --> 01:50:42,470
think I'm supposed to be here. Secret button that kills you. Should I press it? That's a callback,

507
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:58,760
isn't it? What happened? I have a feeling that wasn't the right way. I should check the maze

508
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:12,340
again. What? Yep. Still a mailbox. Hmm. It's empty. I'll have to check back later. Do I get in the

509
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:20,140
road? Dean Dingus lost my vote after he strangled three people. If I put it away now, people will

510
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:27,909
call me a centrist Andy. Road. All right. Look at road. I've got to figure out a way to slow down

511
01:51:27,909 --> 01:51:35,619
the rumor to talk to him. Will he just hit me? I'm just in the road. Well, that was a close one. I

512
01:51:35,619 --> 01:51:41,020
should find a way of slowing him down. I'm not putting my hand on that. It's probably a thousand

513
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:59,979
degrees. Telephone pole? Telephone pole. Looks pretty tall. Can I die up here? What the hell?

514
01:52:10,579 --> 01:52:14,420
Wow. I did not think it would be this high up. I hope there's no fall joke incoming. Of course

515
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:26,170
there is. Looks like another balloon from Boston is coming in. It's a cable box. Screwed shut. This

516
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:30,149
is probably where all the internet wires go. Listen, I don't really know how it works. Just

517
01:52:30,149 --> 01:52:35,369
trust me. I can't open it. It's screwed shut. I've got to find some item that will let me

518
01:52:35,369 --> 01:52:52,970
unscrew a screw. I need a screwdriver. I love the carnival in the distance.

519
01:52:53,369 --> 01:53:07,109
I think I used it. I don't have it anymore. So I have to figure that maze out. Let's go back in

520
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:15,770
the house. I just want to slow down the rumor. What can I get? This is the Reddit room. What

521
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:28,500
about further down here? Okay. Hold on a minute. Let's see, man. Okay. Hallway. It's the clowns in

522
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:40,140
the house. Okay. Something about these two looks kind of funny. How do you keep getting into my

523
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:51,260
house? Select an action. All right. How about some bread? Ask for bread. Hey, can I have some bread?

524
01:53:51,979 --> 01:54:00,420
I'll take that as a yes. Oh, nice. All right. Quest complete. Find something to eat, right?

525
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:07,460
I need more? How do you two keep getting into my house? All right. What about flirt?

526
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:22,149
You want to clown around for a bit? Uh, be rude. I hate your stupid clown guts. Oh, nothing. Can

527
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:33,460
I get more food? Flirt? You know what they say about guys with comically large shoes?

528
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:46,090
I don't think they like this. Sliding door? Let's go back. Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. Garbage? Banana

529
01:54:46,090 --> 01:55:00,250
peel? Banana was not very appealing. I know. I know. Sorry. Oh, sunflowers. Anything else in here?

530
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:11,350
What's in there? I've been doing some archaeology recently. Get it. Let's see. Geos. Grotto. Beast

531
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:17,340
cars. Buried treasure. Aha. What's this? Looks like some ancient Greek tablet. I wonder how

532
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:33,930
that got here. Okay. So this is a code. This is, I got to crack this code. Can I take it? A is A,

533
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:52,810
B is B, T is G, triangle is D, E is E, Z is Z, H is E, O is F, I is I, K is K, thick, M is M,

534
01:55:52,810 --> 01:56:03,899
N is N, E is X, O is O, H is P, P is R, sideways, M is E. Okay. So it's just a, it's the Greek

535
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:11,000
alphabet. I feel like I'm going to need, I'm going to need to know. I'm going to need to,

536
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,420
I can't even say words. I'm trying to say it too fast. Slow down. I feel like I need to know

537
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:24,859
that later. Say that's better. What's that last symbol called? Infinity.

538
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:56,869
Okay. Use oven. Oh my God. It smells like death in there. What is in there? Is that a pot rose?

539
01:56:56,949 --> 01:57:03,430
How long has it been in there? Oh, it's oven is ruined. Got to find time to clean it out later.

540
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:12,329
Sandwich toaster 9,000. Anything in the fridge? I must've locked it after too many

541
01:57:12,329 --> 01:57:25,590
midnight snack runs. Putting a padlock on your fridge. Oh my trusty sandwich toaster 3,000.

542
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:32,069
It automates the process of assembling the perfect sandwich. All you need is bread, steak yum,

543
01:57:32,069 --> 01:57:39,699
brand meat product, and tons of mayo. It seems like I'm missing some ingredients for the perfect

544
01:57:39,699 --> 01:57:51,479
sandwich. Wait, what? I have to regurgitate this into the toaster? I don't think this works with

545
01:57:51,479 --> 01:58:04,470
that. This is the bread. Still need to find the other ingredients. Okay. So we need steak yum.

546
01:58:09,909 --> 01:58:25,960
Can I get that? Can't just reach in there? Oh, something bit me. Okay. Keep going. Use door.

547
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:40,010
Go to casino. Why is there a casino in my house? It actually did it.

548
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:51,300
It's the joke door.

549
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:16,819
All right. Let's go to the casino. Oh shit. Blackjack table. Mr. Green.

550
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:32,920
Okay. Mr. Green. He's mean. He's green. He runs a casino in my living room. That's about it.

551
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:43,779
Well, well, well, if it isn't little Jeremy Albertson. Act for more gambling. Yep. Time to

552
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:50,869
make that money. Actually, I'm just trying to get to the living room. I'm just trying to get to the

553
01:59:50,869 --> 01:59:56,680
living room. Oh, Jeremy, it seems you've already forgotten about that little debt you owe me after

554
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:07,399
your last visit. What was it again? 5,000 bits. 5,000 bits? That's correct. You kept double or

555
02:00:07,479 --> 02:00:16,470
nothing until I had to cut you off. That being said, sorry. In a show of good faith, I'll loan

556
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:22,630
you a thousand bits to get you off your feet. Thanks, I guess. Now run along and make me,

557
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:32,619
make yourself some money. You sure have a lot of money, Mr. Green. I do. It's all mine and you

558
02:00:32,619 --> 02:00:42,979
can't have any of it. I have a question. How did you get all this money? How did you get all this

559
02:00:42,979 --> 02:00:52,329
money? Gambling, of course, and from idiots. I mean, gamers like you, of course. I almost lost

560
02:00:52,329 --> 02:01:02,789
it all investing in ball coin. Mr. Green, why are you green? Why are flamingos pink? Because they

561
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:23,750
eat shrimp. Oh, is that real? All right. So I have a thousand bits. Are you kidding me? Can I save

562
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:40,949
the game? All right. Save game. Auto save. All right. New save. Okay. So we have a thousand bits.

563
02:01:40,949 --> 02:01:46,500
I need to get to 5,000 to pay off Mr. Green. No saves coming. What am I going to replay the whole

564
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:54,859
game again? We're going all in. All in. Let's go. 13 versus six. You stay on that. Don't move. He's

565
02:01:54,859 --> 02:02:07,960
going to bust right here. See you later. That's very bad. I lost everything. Reset? Refund? Refund?

566
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:18,630
That's what... That's how you play that hand. Everyone's like, oh my God. Omega. No. If you

567
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:23,210
have anything over a 12 versus a deal of showing a six, you don't do anything. That's the highest

568
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,869
chance to win that hand. You don't do anything. You just don't know how to play blackjack.

569
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:32,470
What do you mean nobody stands on 13? You don't know how to play. This is basic blackjack strategy.

570
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:44,619
You don't hit on 13 versus six. Are you out of your mind? That's the bust hand. You don't hit on 13.

571
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:57,239
What are you talking about? You never win at blackjack. Blackjack's my game. That was a warmup

572
02:02:57,239 --> 02:03:06,180
round. Mr. Green, have any money? I seem to be out of money. Wait, really? Already? I guess I'm not

573
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:10,739
entirely surprised, but all right. What's a thousand more bits to Mr. Green anyway? Try not to lose it

574
02:03:10,739 --> 02:03:34,090
all again, Goku. Somebody said always hit below 15. That's not... Don't do that. Here we go. Always

575
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:50,789
hit below 21. All right. Double aces. I want to split these. I want to split these. I'll get a

576
02:03:50,789 --> 02:04:04,760
21. All right. We're going to stay at 500. Eight versus... Come on. That sucks. This sucks. I have

577
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:12,920
to hit this. I had to. Yeah. 17 versus nine. I'm just going to lose. I always have to assume that

578
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:18,340
there's a face card underneath there. You have to assume that there's a face card underneath there.

579
02:04:18,899 --> 02:04:27,479
Guys, I have way more experience than you do loading up the blackjack app on your phone for

580
02:04:27,479 --> 02:04:43,930
15 minutes. You understand? That's not how you play blackjack. I'm screwed again. I have to hit

581
02:04:43,930 --> 02:04:48,020
again. See? That's the way you do it because that's an 18. You see what happened? Do you understand

582
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:57,050
now? Anything over an eight, you have to hit if you don't have at least 18. You have to. Otherwise,

583
02:04:57,050 --> 02:05:06,979
they flip over the 10, it's over. You lose. This is bad, but we're staying. You don't hit against

584
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:15,079
the 16 ever. You don't hit this. You just don't. That's why. See? Sit down. Sit down next to me.

585
02:05:15,319 --> 02:05:28,359
Pull up a chair and learn something. This is bad. This is very bad. I have to hit. This is very bad.

586
02:05:28,359 --> 02:05:36,060
I have to though. Thank you very much. I'll take notes. Take notes. I just won. See? That hand is

587
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:54,970
guaranteed to lose if you don't do what I just did. It's not lucky. It's statistics. Don't get a 10.

588
02:05:54,970 --> 02:06:00,699
There you go. He's going to bust right there. Thank you. You can pay the debt back now. Yeah,

589
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:27,260
but I got $400 of fun money. Had to hit that. I'm going to get 10 right here. There it is.

590
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:36,310
Nothing. Nothing. 15. You're going to bust. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. I got $1,000 of fun

591
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:47,579
money. Let's go. 10. Let me give me an ace right now. Oh, you have money. Now I got $2,000 of fun

592
02:06:47,579 --> 02:07:00,470
money. 14 versus an ace. Oh, it's over. All right. That's not bad. I win. Again. Let's go. All right.

593
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:16,569
Let's go. Come on. Last hand. Bingo. This is it. Give me 10. Oh, oh, you piece of shit.

594
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:35,180
Here's the money I owe you. Wonderful. Come back soon. Oh, he moves out of the way. Okay. I still

595
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:56,659
have money, right? 17 versus 2. Fuck. I'm staying. Lost. This is it. Last one. Blackjack. Oh, yes.

596
02:07:57,539 --> 02:08:20,489
There it is. $20,000. Goodbye. I already paid it. Did I pay him twice? I didn't pay him twice,

597
02:08:20,489 --> 02:08:34,729
right? I just paid him twice. What the hell? No. What? Fuck. Oh, it's all right. Whatever. I don't

598
02:08:34,729 --> 02:08:46,600
care. I paid him. I paid him. I paid him twice. That was stupid. And I wanted to get that money

599
02:08:46,600 --> 02:09:18,869
back. Use the telephone. Call Bear. What? What's your emergency? Send up something's wrong. I'm

600
02:09:18,869 --> 02:09:21,270
sorry. There was an emergency. I'm playing an adventure game and I thought it'd be clever.

601
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:37,369
For sure. You're honest. They have a nice day. The door is locked. Use keypad. Wait, do I know

602
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:56,340
what this is? Okay. I don't know what the code is though. It's grandpa. What's on TV, grandpa?

603
02:09:57,140 --> 02:10:16,119
TV's not on. There's nothing to look at. I just realized I don't even touch my nose when I say

604
02:10:16,119 --> 02:10:36,010
that. Move out of the way, you little prick. You're blocking the TV. Grandpa, I thought you were dead.

605
02:10:36,939 --> 02:10:42,760
I am dead. So what? You're acting like you've never seen a ghost before. Now move so I can

606
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:53,189
watch my soaps. What's the afterlife like? Yeah, it's not so bad. I had to crawl my way out of the

607
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:59,850
hell. But at least that was easier than working his damn remote. Oh, right. Uncle Ted sends his

608
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:23,829
love too. What am I? What the hell's going on on this TV? Oh, Steakums. How do I get those?

609
02:11:23,829 --> 02:11:29,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, shit. Steak. Fuck. Whatever. I don't care.

610
02:11:30,229 --> 02:11:57,430
555 yum. Oh shit. All right. 555 yum. What else is this like GTA? 555 yum. Hold on. Very bad, grandpa.

611
02:11:57,989 --> 02:12:15,560

617
02:12:56,659 --> 02:13:09,340
Here's another thousand bits. Thank you. I'm gonna bust. Oh, okay. Let's see. Exactly. We're good.

618
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:18,020
Blackjack. 17 versus five. No, don't do anything ever. No, I hit the wrong button. I hit the wrong

619
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:21,380
button. I hit the wrong button. I actually hit the wrong button. I thought Stan was on the left.

620
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:30,039
Oh my God. What the? That was stupid. I thought that was Stan. Give me more money. This is ridiculous.

621
02:13:30,039 --> 02:13:33,560
How many more times you're going to lose all your money? Well, I paid you twice. So technically,

622
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:42,069
this is my money. I gave you an extra $5,000. So you actually owe me 3000 more dollars. So that's

623
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:53,210
how this is going to work. 12 versus three. Shit. Oh my God. Give me the money you owe me. You owe

624
02:13:53,210 --> 02:14:01,739
me 3000 more dollars. Give it to me. You must be the unluckiest man in Las Vegas. Take the money.

625
02:14:01,739 --> 02:14:12,939
Lose it all. I don't care. This sucks. I hate this. Oh my God. Give me a fucking break.

626
02:14:12,939 --> 02:14:25,100
He still owes me two grand. I'm gonna get it. I might not just not going all in. You're going

627
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:31,579
to run me out of business. You owe me another thousand dollars. There it is. All right. Nobody

628
02:14:31,579 --> 02:14:38,869
move. Oh my fucking God. Okay. I blame this on the fact that I gave him five extra thousand more

629
02:14:38,869 --> 02:14:48,340
dollars and I accidentally hit when I had a guaranteed win. I feel like I've already given

630
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:58,149
you more than 5000 bits of you owe me. Just take it. 19. There it is. Come on. Don't accidentally

631
02:14:58,149 --> 02:15:08,649
do anything stupid. 18. Give me it. Good. Again. Again. There is the 20 versus the 19. Stay.

632
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:19,260
Whatever. Whatever. You keep getting aces. That's stupid. 20 again. Stay. Don't move. You're not

633
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,420
going to get any. You're not going to get shit. You're going to get 18 and that's the win. All

634
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:29,420
right. Here we go. Last one. All in 4000 hand. Let's go. Here's your 10. Here comes your 10.

635
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:33,739
Again. 18. I'll take it. Stay against two. Thank you so much. I'll take that money. I'll take it.

636
02:15:33,739 --> 02:15:40,939
We're going to do one more. We're going to do one more at. We're going to do one more 4000.

637
02:15:42,630 --> 02:15:46,229
Thank you very much. That's it. This could be a push because it's probably a 10 under there.

638
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:50,869
It's not. There's 12,000 dollars. Thank you so much. We're going to do one more at two,

639
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:59,180
which gets a 16 versus six. Don't do anything. Don't listen to people in the chat that say to

640
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:05,369
do something. Sir, I don't care if I lost. That's how you play that hand. That's how you play that

641
02:16:05,369 --> 02:16:39,079
hand. Fuck it. No. Oh, I got to check my mailbox. No insurance. Don't ever do insurance. Don't do

642
02:16:39,079 --> 02:16:55,479
insurance. Are we going to go outside? Mailbox. Wow. The package from steak from meat yums is

643
02:16:55,479 --> 02:17:06,219
here already. That was speedy. Definitely been in there for too long. Okay. Now I just need. What

644
02:17:06,219 --> 02:17:30,059
do I need? Mayo. Right. Okay. Get this in here. I got to do the maze. Let me get this in here first.

645
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:43,219
Was there something else I could do over here? I feel like there was. Okay. Is the phone. I need

646
02:17:43,219 --> 02:17:50,409
the keypad to get in this door. Oh, grandpa. Right. Let me talk to grandpa. There's another

647
02:17:50,409 --> 02:18:00,229
hallway. What else is down here? Framed picture. Jerma is a river in southeastern Serbia and western

648
02:18:00,229 --> 02:18:06,739
Bulgaria. It is notable for passing the Serbian Bulgarian border twice. The Jerma originates in

649
02:18:06,739 --> 02:18:13,620
the under and the undeveloped and sparsely populated area of Kragist in the southeastern

650
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:19,879
corner of Serbia. Starting from the area between the artificial lake Vlasina and the Bulgarian

651
02:18:19,879 --> 02:18:25,079
border, it flows to the northwest on the eastern slopes of the Gramada mountain. Passing through

652
02:18:25,079 --> 02:18:30,440
the village of Klesura, after which it enters an arid region stretching over the border into

653
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:35,799
Bulgaria. This is where the Jerma crosses the border for the first time and at the border crossing

654
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:47,909
of Strezimrivoci. Okay. Bathroom. Hair dryer. No, thanks. My hair is already dry.

655
02:18:48,549 --> 02:19:04,790
Okay. Can I use the toilet? All right. Computer number two. This is my number two

656
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:14,840
I mean my second computer that I use for business reasons. Okay. Anything else I can do? Nothing on

657
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:19,479
the ground or anything? I feel like I'm going to need this. My hair is already dry. All right.

658
02:19:19,799 --> 02:19:30,379
I'll probably have to come back here later. The mirror. There is. All right. That is funny. Okay.

659
02:19:30,379 --> 02:19:51,750
Basement. This is kind of creepy. Oh, shit. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on.

660
02:19:54,780 --> 02:20:04,379
I gotta get this right. Give me one second. Give me just one quick second here. I'm going to make

661
02:20:04,379 --> 02:20:18,440
it, you know, okay. Oh, yes. Okay. Oh, it's my good friend. He's a wonderful, wonderful man from what

662
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:35,850
I've seen. What are you doing down in my basement? What does it look like on your own business?

663
02:20:40,329 --> 02:20:51,540
What are you doing down here? What do I do? Hot roast? I don't think this works with that.

664
02:20:53,899 --> 02:21:07,959
So what? Banana peel? Okay. Wait, turn off the light. I gotta bring obviously have to bring

665
02:21:07,959 --> 02:21:25,350
bugleberry something. Banana on the rumor? Yeah, I was thinking that too. Maybe grandpa has something.

666
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:33,139
Let's see. How did you die? What? You don't remember? I suppose I was a few years ago.

667
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:38,659
As I remember Demon Lord Zaraxas chokeslam me into hell, completely obliterating my spinal cord.

668
02:21:39,819 --> 02:21:43,340
Can't live without a spinal cord, son. Nothing unnatural about that.

669
02:21:44,299 --> 02:21:51,100
Yeah, I suppose you're right. What are you watching? There's nothing good on TV anymore,

670
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:57,340
except for that steak yum commercial. It's got a good jingle. What's the afterlife like?

671
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:05,500
It's not so bad. I already told you this. I told you already everything that you just wanted to know.

672
02:22:08,459 --> 02:22:24,379
On a pot roast? I don't think that works. Put the hairdryer in the tub. What? Are you telling me to

673
02:22:24,379 --> 02:22:37,379
kill bugleberry? What's wrong with you? Here's a tip I use all the time back in my chocolate

674
02:22:37,379 --> 02:22:42,100
making days. If you ever make money, save. If you ever lose money, load an old save.

675
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:51,350
Infinite money glitch. Oh, this is, I hate when you need something like this versus three.

676
02:22:52,069 --> 02:22:55,909
Because you can make so many things with a three, but I can't make very much anything with a 16.

677
02:22:56,629 --> 02:23:01,350
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stay. He's gonna bust right here. Yeah, that sucks. Like there's not

678
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:05,270
much I can do there. And if I had taken that card, it would have been 21, which that sucks.

679
02:23:05,909 --> 02:23:22,709
One more time. Hit. 13 versus eight. That sucks. Hit again. 15 versus eight. That sucks. Even more.

680
02:23:22,709 --> 02:23:35,540
Hit again. Okay. We're good. All right. All right. We're back. We're back. 12 versus 10. That sucks.

681
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:40,360
Come on. Give me something low. Okay. All right. We're good. We're back. We're back. All right. One

682
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:47,129
more of those. And then this is actually it. I'm done. This is the big one right here. 13 versus

683
02:23:47,129 --> 02:23:50,809
seven. I have to hit that. It's going to be low. Thank you 21. Goodbye. Take it. Put it in the bank.

684
02:23:52,389 --> 02:24:02,760
Put it in the bank. Here's that money I owe you. Wonderful. Come back. All right. Good. We're good.

685
02:24:03,399 --> 02:24:27,959
Should have like four grand. Go outside. I gotta, I gotta figure this out.

686
02:24:27,959 --> 02:24:30,920
Bob watchers skip one hour. All right. So what, what, how do we do this?

687
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:57,129
Go to the exit, the right. Okay. So I can go up or left. I'm going to go up and then left again,

688
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:29,000
then left again and left again, up or down. I'm going to say up, up again, right, down,

689
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:53,930
up or right. I think I'm going to bunker door. It looks like an old nuclear fallout bunker

690
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:11,610
generator. Lots of fumes coming out of this one. Wall dad looks like a construction worker. How

691
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:22,379
long has he been in my walls? Yeah. What was that? Jason, you've come back. Wait, you're not Jason.

692
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:28,680
My name is Jeremy. Who's Jason? What are you doing in my wall? My son, Jason, he was supposed to

693
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:36,520
bring me my pot roast for dinner ages ago. Well, I guess it's canceled because I can't get that

694
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:42,600
kind of food. So I'll have canned beans instead. Do you know how to turn the internet back on?

695
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:52,659
Well, sure I do. I did all the wiring around the house. I would help you, but I'm just so hungry

696
02:26:52,659 --> 02:26:58,440
thinking about that pot roast. I simply could not lift a finger until I've eaten. It's not very

697
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:08,020
helpful. You know where Otto is? Otto, is that one of Jason's friends? I haven't seen him around.

698
02:27:08,659 --> 02:27:17,270
No, nevermind. Okay. How long have you been in here for? It's hard to tell. Days turn into months

699
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:23,500
in here. Fumes from that generator sure don't help. Oh, well, it's a living. You make money

700
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:32,219
being in here? Not really. Just an expression. There you go. Well, pot roast, no way. Oh,

701
02:27:32,219 --> 02:27:40,680
oh. Oh, I don't feel so good. I was going to help you with the internet, but here,

702
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:45,399
take the screwdriver. Just open the electrical box on the telephone pole outside. I'm going to

703
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:59,639
lay down for a while. Nice. Very nice. I'm going to get going. Pretty good setup you got down here.

704
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:16,520
Hey, don't touch that. Okay. Oh, I got to skip. Now, let's go to the internet.

705
02:28:17,159 --> 02:28:35,819
It's the hearthstone noise. Touch that. And then we'll come down to the banana pill on the road.

706
02:28:37,270 --> 02:28:41,829
Hey, Mike Toyota, thanks for the 20 community subs. Appreciate it. 20 subs. There's been like

707
02:28:41,829 --> 02:29:10,090
three or four of those. Open sesame. Oh, God. Okay. What am I supposed to do? Oh, that was easy.

708
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:23,579
QTE of the day brought to you by. I mean, there's nothing to do with this.

709
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:36,520
This has nothing to do with this. Okay, so did I get the internet back on?

710
02:29:37,319 --> 02:29:45,739
All right. Internet sorted. No problem. Very cool. All right, let's do this.

711
02:29:46,459 --> 02:30:08,649
I think this works. I think I just killed somebody. An O from Otto. Note to self. Not a good lead.

712
02:30:08,649 --> 02:30:13,610
Why would the rumor know anything anyways? He's never even seen the cookies. I should talk to

713
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:18,329
Jax. I saw him snooping around yesterday looking for a snack. The code to his room is

714
02:30:18,889 --> 02:30:34,309
Omega LUL. Cookies. Okay, Omega LUL. Let's pretend like this didn't happen. All right.

715
02:30:36,409 --> 02:30:50,569
Omega LUL. That's on this door down here. Wait, I can use the freezer. Frozen cheese.

716
02:30:53,750 --> 02:31:00,700
Wait, I can get the key here. How is the rat going to smell the cheese if it's frozen?

717
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:06,680
I have to cook it. Cheese in the oven? There's no way I'm opening that again.

718
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:29,209
Cheese in the microwave? Oh, yep. Hair dryer. Okay, Omega LUL. What was it? It's LUL. What is L?

719
02:31:29,770 --> 02:31:55,370
Which one of these is L? Omega? Which one's U? What's U? LUL. Got it. Okay. That's what the Omega

720
02:31:55,370 --> 02:32:14,100
symbol is. Yeah, I know what it is. Oh, this is the old room. Cool. Okay. Hey, sorry for interrupting.

721
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:21,340
Have you seen Otto? A note of his said he was going to talk to you. Otto? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Right.

722
02:32:22,059 --> 02:32:27,100
He was in here a little while ago asking me about cookies. He left this note here, but I'm way too

723
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:32,409
busy to reach into my pocket and fish it out. If I beat your high score, would you put down the

724
02:32:32,409 --> 02:32:39,420
light gun for one second? You beating my high score? Didn't you die to pinwheel? You can try,

725
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:51,030
I guess. I also beat Dark Souls on stream, you know. You gonna let me play? Sure. Stop whining.

726
02:32:51,989 --> 02:33:13,780
Mad Dog's Bottle Busters. Okay. I thought I just killed him. Where is it? Where is it? What's the

727
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:52,549
high score? I don't have ammo. It's probably a thousand points, right? 10,000 points? Damn it.

728
02:33:52,549 --> 02:34:12,889
I got it. That's definitely a thousand. 1,200. Is that enough? You don't have to hit all of them.

729
02:34:12,889 --> 02:34:21,370
But you actually did it? Beat my high score? That's right. The god gamer himself in the flesh. Now,

730
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:26,389
where's that note from Otto? Right. Sorry. I'm still in shock here. Here you go. Take it.

731
02:34:26,389 --> 02:34:31,719
The cookie trail has gone cold. Jack doesn't know where the cookies are,

732
02:34:31,719 --> 02:34:36,870
and I'm beginning to lose hope that I'll ever find the cookies. The only clue I have left

733
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:43,819
is the trail of water I found leading to the basement. Time to pay a visit to B.F. Bugleberry.

734
02:34:43,819 --> 02:35:02,010
See what he can tell us. Oh, you can just play. Okay. Down to the basement. Maybe we'll have new

735
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:26,149
dialogue with Bugleberry. Wait. Let's do this. Very cool. Mm. Ooey gooey cheese. Let's do the

736
02:35:26,149 --> 02:35:43,350
rat thing first because I feel like I'm going to need a key. Into the kitchen. Okay. Here's the

737
02:35:43,350 --> 02:35:58,600
cheese. Thank you. I'm going to assume I can open this door now. It's the only lock in the whole

738
02:35:58,600 --> 02:36:20,969
house. Huh? Oh, shit. I can make the sandwich. All right. Let's get the sandwich made. Perfect.

739
02:36:20,969 --> 02:36:37,940
Now time to turn it on and get cooking. Make the perfect sandwich. Very good. Perfect. I was

740
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:43,450
starving. Feels like I haven't eaten anything all day. Well, you know what I mean. All right.

741
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:53,209
Now we have to go find Otto. Close the fridge? I just did. Go to the basement. Talk to Bugleberry.

742
02:37:00,739 --> 02:37:09,540
Basement's all the way over here, right? Yeah. Oh, gamble? No. I don't need to.

743
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:31,670
Okay. God. Otto said you'd be down here. Do you know where the cookies went? Cookies? Ah, yes.

744
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:41,530
I've been using the cookies as ingredients in my cauldron. I have one left. What? I'm

745
02:37:41,530 --> 02:37:48,329
guessing you need me to solve some convoluted puzzle for you. How did you know? I've been trying

746
02:37:48,329 --> 02:37:52,729
to follow the recipe for the perfect German character, but the page in my book has been

747
02:37:52,729 --> 02:38:00,139
ripped to pieces. If you can recreate the recipe for me, I'll give you the last cookie. I will.

748
02:38:00,940 --> 02:38:16,309
Take a look at that recipe. Okay. In this order, these symbols in this order. Is this important

749
02:38:16,309 --> 02:38:29,620
too? Is this the Greek alphabet? Hold on. What was it? No, no, no, no, no. Hold on.

750
02:38:29,620 --> 02:39:00,889
I just want to see what happens. Jeremy Germstar. All right. That was an interesting one.

751
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:08,389
It's not the one we're looking for. I want to do that again. All right. We're going to do blue and

752
02:39:08,389 --> 02:39:36,180
green. Blue, blue, green, green, and then red. Oh no, purple. And New Year's German. It's a

753
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:41,829
gotcha game. Well, that was an interesting one, but it's not the one we're looking for.

754
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:53,860
All right. What's the actual one? Let me see the recipe. Okay. Circle, square, triangle, star,

755
02:39:53,940 --> 02:40:01,239
triangle in those colors ordered. Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle, red, green. I gotta

756
02:40:01,239 --> 02:40:13,799
write this down. I haven't tweet this stream out. Don't write it down. How am I going to remember

757
02:40:13,799 --> 02:40:23,020
this? Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green,

758
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:31,319
purple, red, green, purple, red, green, purple, circle, red, circle. There's no red circle.

759
02:40:33,659 --> 02:40:45,979
There's no red circle. Where is it? Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle in this order.

760
02:40:50,469 --> 02:40:58,549
Oh, it doesn't. Okay. So I just have to do circle. These are the symbols. So what's, what's not on

761
02:40:58,549 --> 02:41:14,139
here? Circle, square, triangle, star, no hearts, no hearts at all. I get it. Okay. So we need to do

762
02:41:14,139 --> 02:41:24,219
red, green, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green.

763
02:41:26,059 --> 02:41:44,739
I have to write it down. Purple, blue, yellow. I think I got it. I'm just going to write it down.

764
02:41:44,739 --> 02:41:56,059
Why would I? You write shit down on these games. Just write it down. I'm writing it down. I'm

765
02:41:56,059 --> 02:42:03,430
writing it down. I'm going to write it down. Okay. Why are there two triangles up there?

766
02:42:03,989 --> 02:42:19,780
Oh, I have to use two triangles. I'm writing it down. Did I read this? I've read this, right? Met

767
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:24,659
a couple at a random restaurant who told me about a wrestler dying. I don't know them and don't know

768
02:42:24,659 --> 02:42:29,299
the wrestler. I was in a city I do not know at all. I may have been visiting. I was invited to

769
02:42:29,299 --> 02:42:34,860
his funeral and was trying to be polite and said yes. A couple then sent me a referral link to a

770
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:43,180
weird online system to accept the invite slash make payments. I ignored it and went back to my room.

771
02:42:43,739 --> 02:42:49,500
I got ready to go, was in a full suit, and took a car a few miles away to the spot I met the couple.

772
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:55,180
I had the address written down for the funeral, but left it in my room. For some reason, I figured

773
02:42:55,180 --> 02:43:01,020
it was right across the street from the restaurant we met. I couldn't find it. I looked everywhere.

774
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:06,620
After an hour or so, I went back to my room and said fuck it. After a while, I got a phone call

775
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:11,500
from the couple who asked if I was still going. The funeral was well underway and I didn't want

776
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:17,579
to just walk in at the end. They gave me the address and it was a 50 minute drive from my room.

777
02:43:18,219 --> 02:43:22,540
They started having bad reception and told me to sign up for their referral link again before I

778
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:36,040
hung up. It was a dream I had. Did I tell you guys that one? Did I go over that one before?

779
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:45,459
No? I wrote it down. That's when I woke up. What was I doing? Oh right, I was writing this down.

780
02:43:45,459 --> 02:43:54,409
Hold on, let me write this down. Why did he read it like he's never seen it? I mean I have seen

781
02:43:54,409 --> 02:44:01,899
it before. It's been a while. That was December of 2020 is when I had that dream. Okay,

782
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:13,219
let's keep going. What was I writing this down? A note. New note. Okay, circle, square, triangle,

783
02:44:16,059 --> 02:44:36,969
R, triangle. The order is red, green, purple, blue. All right, let's do it. Okay, so circle.

784
02:44:37,770 --> 02:44:52,100
I need red. A red square. There's no red circle so we're gonna do red square. Green

785
02:44:52,979 --> 02:45:07,909
square. No, green triangle. Thank you. And then we need to do purple. Purple

786
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:26,579
circle and then blue star. Yellow triangle. Oh fuck, what happened? Yellow circle?

787
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:35,100
It said there was two triangles. There's only one. It's orange. Isn't that orange?

788
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:56,700
Just use the triangle. Catboy! Is that the one? That's it. My finest creation yet.

789
02:45:57,340 --> 02:46:04,379
Chad is going to love this. Just think of all the fan art. As promised, here is the last cookie.

790
02:46:05,260 --> 02:46:07,899
No need to throw. I wouldn't if I were you.

791
02:46:08,540 --> 02:46:17,379
I should take this back to Otto's bed. He can smell cookies from a mile away.

792
02:46:23,979 --> 02:47:04,329
Off-brand bugleberry. That's, no, I, whatever. Let's go see if we can find him. Somebody said,

793
02:47:04,329 --> 02:47:14,309
Jesus Christ. It's not real. It's not real money. It's not real as my bank account is not linked to

794
02:47:14,309 --> 02:47:30,739
the game. Okay, here we go. Do we do it? Otto! It's Otto, the wonder dog. Ready for your walk?

795
02:47:30,739 --> 02:47:48,149
That was a great walk. Hey, where'd Otto go? Where is he? Is there another note?

796
02:47:53,530 --> 02:48:10,120
No. Backyard? Was it chocolate on that? What's the thing that, what is it?

797
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:12,520
It's something that is like chocolate but it's not chocolate. What's it called?

798
02:48:16,889 --> 02:48:42,379
Carib. Yeah. Where's Otto? This had to have been finished very recently, right? Because this was

799
02:48:42,379 --> 02:48:49,770
only like a month or two ago. This is a couple months ago. Be able to add all this? All the

800
02:48:49,770 --> 02:49:05,379
dollhouse references? That had been pretty late in development. Where's Otto? Who's a good boy?

801
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:20,420
Otto. That's so cute. Is it time to stream? Let's see. I got an achievement that just said

802
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:46,250
minus two worst stream of the year. Blinking. I was just lost in my brain trying to find any

803
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:54,860
game. You can just see the cogs turning to like just say any video game. I have no idea. What was

804
02:49:54,860 --> 02:50:14,569
the last thing I played? And that was really fun. Those two were really cool. Game by William

805
02:50:14,569 --> 02:50:28,420
Enders aka 14 hour lunch break aka dev in chat art. Very good job. That was very cute. Additional

806
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:39,420
3D models. Look at that. Yeah, well done. That was really, that was really fun. Excellent, excellent

807
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:51,850
work. Both of the development teams that made these games. Jeff McCloud. Jeff McCloud is just,

808
02:50:52,409 --> 02:51:09,659
he's the Picasso of royalty free music. Special thanks. German voice line emporium.

809
02:51:09,659 --> 02:51:21,399
What? That exists? Very cool. Steam support team. I don't know. Was there an issue? I wonder.

810
02:51:21,399 --> 02:51:35,340
Hey, thanks for making it. It's really fun. It doesn't know that there's a voice treasury

811
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:44,360
of everything he's ever said. Well, whatever. No, don't do this. We have to do this every...

812
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:44,840
Fine.

813
02:51:58,549 --> 02:52:02,969
All right. We got, we got our expectations subverted three times there.

814
02:52:02,969 --> 02:52:14,010
Very cool. Oh, I got an achievement plus two. If you're getting the German cough emporium,

815
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:21,530
the German sneeze emporium and the German yawn emporium. Why? Why do you want all that?

816
02:52:26,950 --> 02:52:37,319
Why do you want a bunch of times that I've like coughed? That was really cool. I'm very happy

817
02:52:37,319 --> 02:52:48,299
with that. That was a lot of fun. So now those are the two of the community games I wanted to play.

818
02:52:48,940 --> 02:53:01,690
What am I? Don't what? End of the stream voice? Um, I actually probably maybe because

819
02:53:02,569 --> 02:53:09,989
I want to get back to like Saturday, Sunday. So we're probably going to just go Saturday, Sunday

820
02:53:10,469 --> 02:53:15,909
to kind of get back to normal here. Three hour Andy. I did say it was only going to be a three

821
02:53:15,909 --> 02:53:19,909
hour stream on Twitter. Did I even tweet that? No, I didn't. What? Am I misremembering that?

822
02:53:22,219 --> 02:53:28,299
I tweeted, right? What? What did I say on the tweet? Playing a couple of fan games,

823
02:53:28,299 --> 02:53:33,829
hanging out for a few hours. All right. I said that. Yeah. Yeah. I want to do Saturday, Sunday.

824
02:53:33,829 --> 02:53:37,829
I want to get back to that because like I said, I don't want to be once a week anymore. I want to

825
02:53:37,829 --> 02:53:44,260
be like twice a week. So we'll, we can call it here. I'll be back on Saturday, Sunday for more

826
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:56,219
longer, substantial streams. Not just three hours. A few is eight hours. But I want to get in the

827
02:53:56,219 --> 02:54:00,379
habit of even if I'm not going to be around for that long, I still want to pop in for a few hours,

828
02:54:00,379 --> 02:54:09,209
like at least two times a week. I'm slowly trying to get back to not doing once a week anymore.

829
02:54:09,209 --> 02:54:12,649
And we'll see going forward. I'm going to keep trying to add them as I can.

830
02:54:14,489 --> 02:54:22,040
And I will see you guys on Saturday. We'll do Saturday, Sunday. I have plans. If you don't

831
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:26,790
know what the Halloween plan is, although that's next weekend, we're going to be watching a bunch

832
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:32,389
of public domain movies on Halloween like we did last time. That was one of the funnest streams ever.

833
02:54:33,030 --> 02:54:37,190
Hopefully we have a good time again. We're going to watch at least three or four plus hours,

834
02:54:37,829 --> 02:54:44,729
even more, maybe five plus hours of old shitty movies. See if we can find some. And by the way,

835
02:54:44,729 --> 02:54:48,629
there's a possibility we might see the Ritz brothers return. I think they have another one

836
02:54:48,629 --> 02:54:55,559
or two that we could watch. But to the people that made, and there's other community games too

837
02:54:56,360 --> 02:55:04,809
that exist. I know during the community content nights, I know a couple of them came in. So this

838
02:55:04,809 --> 02:55:12,250
is fun to do. I'd like to compile them every now and then. Really, really good job. This is really

839
02:55:12,250 --> 02:55:16,940
fun. It's shocking to me that if somebody wants to put the amount of time that it takes to make

840
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:24,309
something like this just for fun and just to maybe have people play it and enjoy it and be connected

841
02:55:24,309 --> 02:55:29,430
to this community and the stream and everything, it's mind blowing. So I hope it was fun to work

842
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:37,500
on. It was really fun to play. But that's going to be the end of the stream. I will see you guys

843
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:42,549
on Saturday, Sunday. We will get back to normal on the Saturday, Sunday, weekend, Andy schedule.

844
02:55:42,549 --> 02:55:56,340
Let's do a raid. We raid, raid, raid Neanderthals? Yeah, sure. Yeah, let's go. I haven't raided

845
02:55:56,340 --> 02:56:15,670
somebody in a while. What is Neanderthals playing? Minecraft? Time for a raid song? No, no more. Hey,

846
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:20,709
nobody wants to do the raid song. Nobody wants to do the raid song. The raid song was not,

847
02:56:20,709 --> 02:56:25,770
I'm telling you right now, as comedy professor, your comedy professor, we talked about it like

848
02:56:25,770 --> 02:56:33,209
two or three hours ago. That, that's not, yeah, that gets you removed from the class. By the way,

849
02:56:33,209 --> 02:56:38,409
I want to make this clear too. If somebody farts into a baked Lays bag and you come in the next

850
02:56:38,409 --> 02:56:43,059
day and fart into a baked Lays bag, I'm going to send you home, right? You can't, we can't have

851
02:56:43,059 --> 02:56:48,579
like 30 people all fart into a baked Lays bag at the same time the next day, right? That person

852
02:56:48,579 --> 02:56:53,530
got an A. You gotta do something else. And there's people that probably just came in like 20 minutes

853
02:56:53,530 --> 02:57:00,540
ago that have no idea what we're talking about. It's fine. Go say hello to Neanderthals. I will

854
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:05,049
talk to you guys on Saturday. Have a great one. We will do some longer streams on Saturday,

855
02:57:05,049 --> 02:57:09,829
Sunday. I have a lot of things I want to prepare. Thanks for watching. As always,

856
02:57:09,829 --> 02:57:14,389
the community shit is awesome. I love to do it. I wish we could still do the community video stuff,

857
02:57:14,389 --> 02:57:19,829
but I can't play eight minutes uninterrupted of Star Wars. That would get me removed,

858
02:57:19,829 --> 02:57:27,129
I believe, from the platform. So we can't do that anymore. I'm surprised we got away with it as long

859
02:57:27,129 --> 02:57:35,610
as we did, if I'm very honest with you. So, unfortunately, but if we can do stuff like this,

860
02:57:35,610 --> 02:57:39,879
I'd love to do it. So have a great rest of your night. Thanks for hanging out for the few hours

861
02:57:39,879 --> 02:57:48,219
that we were here. See you Saturday at 2pm Pacific. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon.

862
02:57:48,219 --> 02:58:06,840
Oh my God. Wait, I didn't even do the outro. What the fuck? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

863
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:14,540
it's too fast. Oh, I thought it was ending right now. Okay, I thought it was actually like you were

864
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:24,120
getting sent in now. I just fucking panicked. I wanted to do the subs too. I just was queuing

865
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:31,450
up the raid. That was actual panic. Oh my God. That scared the shit out of me for some reason.

866
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:37,719
I saw the bar on my screen was going in five seconds. I'm sorry. Oh shit, we're gonna- I'm

867
02:58:37,719 --> 02:58:42,459
gonna have to cancel this. Can we get through the subs? I can't believe there's this many people

868
02:58:42,459 --> 02:58:48,780
that still subbed to the channel. This is insane. We're not even gonna get through the Ds by the

869
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:58,090
time the raid happens. We're only in the Ds. We're in the Gs. I have to cancel the raid.

870
02:58:59,129 --> 02:59:04,979
I have to cancel it. We'll do it again in a second. Just wait. Yeah, I'm canceling the raid. We have

871
02:59:04,979 --> 02:59:11,590
to do it again in a second. I'm sorry. Wait, somebody just gave subs and it superseded my

872
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:18,790
ability to cancel the raid. I can't cancel the raid anymore. It's- 8-bit just gave 10 community

873
02:59:18,790 --> 02:59:23,750
subs and I can't click any buttons now. It's taking over. You're just gonna go. I'm so sorry.

874
02:59:23,750 --> 02:59:26,899
Oh my God, I can't stop it.
