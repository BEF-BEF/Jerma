1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:54,390
I'm here. Yes, I am. People saying he's not really here. Yes, I am early. No, I said I was gonna be here at one o'clock. We're here. I'm right here. Yay. Just give me a second. I'm crafting a tweet. I'm saying well, I look if you don't those of you that don't know what's going on, you can read the title. It's I mean, it's it's it's in the title. That's right. After crossing 1 million followers on Twitch, it's time to go back to sorcery. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good. That's a good tweet.

2
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:41,420
Actually, the reason why I'm here right now. Oh, what the heck just happened there? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I might have changed servers. Hold on. Let's just make sure that was just a quick little fluke. I might have to change servers real quick. Do I have to change servers? Let's see. That's not a good sign. Let's hope that was a fluke. Just check one thing. Yeah, but hello. I don't like this. I'm already seeing some some frame problems with this.

3
00:01:41,420 --> 00:02:39,620
There's ingest server. See, there's only been one problem so far. Yeah, but that's a that's a bad sign. Let's chill for like 10 minutes. Because I really don't. This is my 1 million Twitch follower stream. I don't want it to be messed up by a bunch of F's. This is this is the stream. This is the stream for a million Twitch followers. We got to make sure this doesn't happen. We'll see. If I have to change servers, I change servers, right? That's how I usually fix it. Anyways. Hello. How are you doing?

4
00:02:39,620 --> 00:04:47,639
Something very important is going to happen today. Those of you that have been around for a long time know that I used to. Well, hold on. Let's just give it a let me. Okay, I'll be right back. I don't want to do my 1 million follower speech before a million people are here. I want to make sure this is not going to happen. All right, give you two seconds. How are you doing? Is it still having problems? I think I'm going to change servers. Yeah, it's I'm dropping more frames. My 1 million follower stream. It says I dropped more frames.

5
00:04:47,639 --> 00:05:11,870
It says I've dropped 400 frames so far, which is 2% of every frame. You're ruining my speech. Is it all right? Is it okay for now? If we have to switch, I'll switch in a minute, right? It should be fine. You think I can? Should I just do it? Let's see if we can write it out.

6
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:33,110
Dude, you brainwashed a million people. Okay. On the viewer end, we're not really seeing it. Really? Okay. It's clearly showing up on my OBS. So I'm just making sure it's not a problem. Whatever. We'll write it out and see if it works.

7
00:05:33,110 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm gonna make my I got to tweet this out and then I'll talk about it. Okay, so for those of you that are new viewers, maybe you've been here for a year, maybe two years. I used to be a YouTuber. I was just on YouTube. I didn't stream. I still have a little bit of a problem here with my with my voice and throat. So just want to make sure you're aware of that too. But those of you that don't know, I used to be on YouTube. I have two like YouTube channels at this point. Second German German 95.

8
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:45,959
I was on YouTube for like six years or whatever it was. Do the speech in the tuber voice. No. Wow. No, who cares? Nobody cares. I care. And that's you know what, I'm gonna do it. Somebody give 100 subs. What the fuck? Thanks for the 100 subs. That was matters of darkness. I don't shout out subs, but that's a lot. Just breaking my own rule. I just looked over and saw it. Okay, you're doing it again. All right, not shouting it out. No more shouting out subs. That's a that's way too many. I'm gonna I don't do this. I won't shout out subs anymore. So I'm not going to

9
00:06:45,959 --> 00:07:16,199
do it because that's that's a that's a crazy amount of sub that I'm not gonna do it again. Thank you though. Thank you to anybody that subs to this channel, regardless if it's one or 100. Okay, so I was a YouTuber. And I took the plunge moved over to Twitch. And on Twitch pretty much ever since obviously the second channel has edits and everything right. And there's that. But the first thing I did when I came over to Twitch was you know what, I'm gonna play my one of my favorite things of all time. And one of my favorite things

10
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:50,579
of all time is sorcery. It's one of the first I think it is the first actual stream I did when I said I'm going to go like full time on Twitch. So after crossing a million followers, we're going back in. We're going to start at part one. It's been like six or seven years. I like to actually play this game anyways, every five years or so because the game is so fun. And there's so much weird shit you can do. And if you don't know what sorcery is, listen to me. It's required

11
00:07:50,579 --> 00:08:28,389
reading for this stream. Let's go over required reading for German 985 for you to be a viewer. You have to have seen every earnest movie twice. You have to be on record saying that Gremlins 2 is better than Gremlins 1. You have to have seen the first at least two Ghostbusters movies. What do you mean we have homework? This is just the way it is. You're gatekeeping. This is this is the way it is. You have to have beaten Glover for the Nintendo 64. That's a fake one. You have to have made at least one dirt house

12
00:08:28,389 --> 00:09:04,570
in Minecraft. Don't tell me what to do. What a consumerist. And you got to go do sorcery. Or just watch this, right? You can just watch it. Let me just tell you something that I the reason why I thought to do this. This didn't. This didn't kind of jump out after a million followers. I mean, I was thinking about what I wanted to do for a million followers. What the hell would I even do? I was probably not gonna do anything. That is a little F. We actually might have to restart it and go to a different server. I'm paranoid by this bullshit. All right, I

13
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:42,490
know I'm out. I'll see you in a minute. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. I'm gonna get it. I gotta get this is gonna be a huge problem for like the next seven hours. I'll be back. Don't leave. It's for a million. Don't leave. I'll be right back. Let's try this again. Let's try this again. I changed servers. Hopefully this fixes it. We don't have any more frame problems. Look, I am not late. Did anybody leave? How many of you left? Did you leave? Hopefully nobody left. It's been 45

14
00:09:42,490 --> 00:10:27,980
seconds. My friend just left. Well, give him a ping and say, Hey, Draper985 is back. All right. So where was I? Let me tell you. Where was I? What was it? Oh, yeah. Wait, it says I've been streaming for 12. Have I been live this whole time? Was it just on like the disconnect like not like this thing? Really? Oh, no. Okay. All right. So again, let's go over this again. Sorcery is one of my favorite things of all time. It's a choose your own adventure book that was turned into

15
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:59,289
a game by this company called Inkle. I have a video on this game from like seven years ago or whatever. I played this game on Twitch. You know the deal. We're back in it for a million followers on Twitch. And if you don't know anything about this game, do you know what to look much up? Don't look anything up about it because we're going to do it again. It's a choose your own adventure book by Steve Jackson. It is fucking unbelievable. And guess what? I wanted to do this for a million followers, but oddly enough,

16
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:33,580
the completely coincidentally almost because I was thinking about what again when I say what I want to do for a million. They Inkle released it again. There's the complete edition exists now. And I think they put it on all the consoles. Because it used to be it was on iPad and on Steam and shit, right? But you can get this on Xbox now. They re-released it. So that's kind of cool. You don't have to get it on an iPad or get it on Steam. You can get it on Xbox and stuff now too. I was like, holy shit. Well, I mean, why does

17
00:11:33,580 --> 00:12:07,559
people just talk about that? But anyways, I'm very excited. I'm it's been a long time since I've done this and I'm gonna get into it. You better believe it. Stas is from this game. It's choose your own. There's gonna be lots of drama people. I'm expecting to see lots of hog champs. I'm expecting to see lots of what the holy shit. What the fuck, dude? It's gonna be crazy. It's gonna be crazy. But I do know that after a while, we'll see how people

18
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:42,279
like it. If people want to keep doing it after the first and second part, then I'm going to keep doing it because let's we can do the whole thing, right? Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready to get to do sorcery back to sorcery? I don't I'm not seeing enough excitement in this chat room. I'm seeing a lot of I'm seeing a lot of like, dude, just watch the earnest movies. I'm not seeing enough excitement here to turn this on. I'm saying, dude, go watch earnest saves Christmas like pog. Like, why don't you just get the right buy the rights to it? It can't be more than a few hundred grand. I

19
00:12:42,279 --> 00:13:26,490
I don't know that I could be inaccurate. So don't I don't know why you're saying that they could but I don't know how much the rights are to the whole franchise. It's probably in like the fucking 10s of millions. Okay. Are you ready? This is like my favorite game of all time. This is like the my favorite thing ever. It's like in the top five stalling I am stalling because I just had to turn my stream off and like 5000 people left. I gave everybody the opportunity. It's like, oh, germ is live. All right, click it. Oh, germ is not live time to go do anything else.

20
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:54,519
Oh, no, I'm gonna go watch somebody else that doesn't have internet problems. That guy German high five sucks. His internet sucks. No, it's not my internet. It's fine. Start already. I hold on. You ready? You guys ready? Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to begin Steve Jackson's sorcery.

21
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:05,360
You have walked the wilds of Kakabad, Bukkare and the spiky backlands all the way into Mampang. You survived traps, thieves, serpents, vengeful gods. And now it is here. The crown of kings. Let's go. Let's freaking go. It is said that the crown was never forged only found by Kalana the reformer, a lowly foot soldier who became emperor of the

22
00:14:40,419 --> 00:15:17,679
eastern world, such as the power of the crown. The air around it crackles with influence. Okay, chat. So should I take it or should I wait? Did I take the crown or should I wait for a little bit? Take it. Your destiny awaits with the crown in your hands, you will be as powerful as Kalana. The goblins are arming the giants awake and the birdmen carving cruel daggers from stone. War will come, but you will prevent it. Then the image of the crown begins

23
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:38,480
to flicker. You rush forward. It's a trap. And startle yourself awake. You are alone, exhausted, in a little hut in the outpost settlement. Your unimaginable journey is not even a single step beyond.

24
00:15:38,480 --> 00:16:27,639
I'm so excited. Inkle presents. Sorcery. Yeah, I got no cam on. I figured cam off, right? Part one, the Shumatanti Hills. Are you ready to get obsessed with this? All of the people in the chat right now understand something. This is required reading. Turn this up a little bit too, so we get some cool sound effects. All right, so this is me. Here's the map. Yeah, something about sorcery that you need to know. Cam on. No, cam off. Cam off. Cam off. It breaks the

25
00:16:27,639 --> 00:17:04,579
immersion. Cam off. It breaks the immersion. You know what I mean? It breaks. It breaks the immersion. We'll do cam off. I'll turn it on periodically. But so the thing about sorcery is this is this is not like a lot of other choose your own adventure things that you see nowadays. Steve Jackson literally made like a hundred million different things you can do. There's so many different things to do here that I've played this game three or four times through all the way. Every five every like three or four years or so, right? I still don't think I've seen everything. And I'm

26
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:50,559
going to go for it again. This is the original Elden Ring. It kind of is just when you think it's that's the end. Oh, just wait. Here we go. I'm going to get into this. Hope you're ready. It is sunrise. You dress breakfast on bread and goat's milk and collect the pack and sword from beside your bed. Test the blade. Pray for luck or leave the hut. F. Why do computers suck? It's fine. It's going to be fine. Don't worry. Don't worry. Computers suck. Just everybody

27
00:17:50,559 --> 00:18:45,990
repeat after me. Computers suck. We're going to let it ride out for a second. I've changed servers like three times. That's getting worse. God damn it. Right after the intro. You can't do this to me, Twitch. Come on. Hold on. Let me do this right for a second. Let me just run a test because my internet every time this happens, my internet is perfect. And I will run a test to Twitch overnight and into the day that has zero drop frames. It's just for some reason, some of these servers just can't fucking handle

28
00:18:45,990 --> 00:19:49,890
the traffic for some reason. I literally have a thousand, a thousand up and down right now. I'm doing it right now. I'm looking at it right now. All right. Whatever. I'm going to go for it. It's just it's just the way it is. Computers suck. Yeah. You're going to get a huge F right now because I'm doing a speed test. It's just locked in at one thousand one thousand. Whatever. Hopefully it evens out. All right. Please even out. Don't do this to me. Come on, Gwen. Really? Anyways, as we were saying. OK. Classic. This is the classic Jerma Stream experience.

29
00:19:49,890 --> 00:20:38,980
You know what? That's actually true. It's definitely an issue connecting to this server. This one, too. You want to know the crazy thing? I'm going to tell you guys the secret. Remember last time this happened and I was like, I'm going to try a different server. Do you know what server worked? It gave me zero problems, literally zero drop frames. I connected to the Mexican server. I literally connected to Mexico and it fixed it. That's how I fixed it last time. Shit. This is getting worse now. Oh, my God. I'm going to have to tell me if it gets bad and I'll fuck it up.

30
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:56,549
I'm going to fucking try it again. Pain in the ass. Like sometimes I just want to like hook up like 16 like SIM cards to my computer and just like beam down Internet here in case this happens every day.

31
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:23,119
I mean, what am I supposed to do here? All right. Here we go. Go to the Mexican server. Why don't I switch to Mexico? Because it doesn't work anymore. You know, and the most frustrating thing about this, I streamed literally two days ago without a single problem.

32
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:46,880
I have perfect speed tests, but I can't connect to these Twitch servers on the West Coast. What the fuck? It's very, very frustrating. I will tell you. I'm just going to go for it. Oh, well, turn it off and turn it on again.

33
00:21:46,880 --> 00:22:00,819
I already did that and I changed wherever server I was going to. It might get better or it might get worse. We'll just look. Let's just sit here and talk about a million followers. It's probably your attitude.

34
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:21,650
But it's just my like I have a shitty attitude. All right, here we go. Fuck it. We're just going to go. If it drops, it drops. I'm going to test my blade. Okay, you pause to test the blade against your thumb. The blacksmith has done well.

35
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:40,490
The edge is keen and it draws a narrow line of blood outside the hut. You hear the outpost settlement stirring into life. So praying in this game is interesting. You have a god that you pray to right now. It's the panther. It can change.

36
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:59,970
And it will over the course of the of the game, right? I don't want to use it because you can only use it once a day. By the way, you have health, you have money and you have food. You need to be very careful with these. It's time to go. I don't want to. I don't want to pray.

37
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:20,309
Time then to depart. You lift back the flap of the hut and step into the early morning sunshine. So as we continue as we play, you're going to see flags are going to appear for places that we can go. It's not always as simple as going in a straight line. The outpost settlement.

38
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:47,960
Eyes follow you as you leave the hut and walk towards the great Schumatante wall. The frontiers people of this tiny settlement are well aware of your mission. Greet them? Let's greet them. You turn. Oh, and we've got these amazing pictures. I forgot about this. The artwork is by Ian Livingston, by the way. It's awesome. It's so interesting and scary. There's a lot of crazy artwork in this game.

39
00:23:47,960 --> 00:24:12,240
You turn to them and bow, some smile and reply, but are too afraid to approach. Others make gestures of protection. You are going beyond the wall, so they believe you to be cursed. A man is waiting on the path to the Cantapani Gate, the final doorway between Analand and the wilds of Kakabad. You recognize the Sergeant of the Sightmaster Warriors. He holds out his hand.

40
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:38,829
Greetings, Sergeant. Get out of my way. Wait, what? Wait, what? There you go. You got it. You got it once. All right. Greetings, Sergeant. Greetings, Sergeant.

41
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:37,720
Take the whole thing, and I have a lot of money. I could take half. I'm going to take the whole thing, because that's just what I wanted. You accept the gift graciously. Thank you. You should buy some supplies before you pass the wall, Sergeant says. And you must collect your spell book if you wish magic to aid you. Finally, should you wish to practice your swordplay, I will go one last round with you. And he points with his staff towards the training ground. So something that's interesting to note about this, for those of you hardcore gamers, you can, I believe you can just not do this.

42
00:25:37,720 --> 00:26:14,359
And not be able to cast spells through the whole game. So that's kind of like stupid. See, like you could just one one of the huts set slightly back from the others is decorated with glyphs and strange symbols. A terrible smell emanates from its doorway. This is the hut of the chief mage. He's been preparing your spell book for days, reading star charts to work out which spells will be available to you in the different locations in the hills and beyond. Go inside. I need the book. I ain't doing this for

43
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:53,230
the book. You lift the flap and go inside. The mage looks up at you with haggard, sleepless eyes and presses the book into your hands. You understand how to use this? He asks. I do. I actually do. And I can tell you guys how to do it. But I do understand how to do it. I will show you in just a moment. Just very moment here. Yes. The mage nods. Good. He scratches absently at his ear. Remember, some spells will cost you effort to use. But the ones that don't will not work without a focus. An item

44
00:26:53,230 --> 00:27:36,250
of some kind. You will need to read the book to know what. Okay. Research magic using the spell book. So here's the thing about sorcery. Computers suck. It's gonna happen. I wish there was something I could do about it. But I am at the mercy of the internet working perfectly to turn a live stream on most of the time. You know what I mean? It's just we're at the mercy of this. We're fine. It's gonna be all right. So why don't we open this up and listen to one of my favorite songs? Hopefully it's not too loud, but let's go. Let's see the spell book. So in sorcery,

45
00:27:36,250 --> 00:28:16,839
in almost every scenario, in almost every single scenario, it'll give you the opportunity to cast a spell. The spells range from zapping people, shooting fireballs out of your hands, floating, putting walls up, controlling non-intelligent creatures, making them stupid. Yeah, there's a ton of stuff you can do. I don't know how Steve Jackson sat here and came up with all these potential scenarios to write out and have different ways to go. But some of them you need actual materials, right? You need, for instance,

46
00:28:16,839 --> 00:29:01,720
gob. Someone's a goblin. And some really, really fun, funny shit can happen. You guys know that you've seen it before. Where's Sus? Let's find it. Come on. Let's get nostalgic here. Where is it? Come on. Where is it? Did I pass it already? There it is. This is Sus. This is sense danger. This is not somebody being suspicious. This is where that comes from on this channel. You know why? Because I would cast this fucking spell every five minutes because I was terrified of everything. I would be like, boom, look to the stars and be like,

47
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:42,599
sense danger. What's wrong? Maybe casting the caster suspects a trap and it will indicate telepathically to the caster if the danger and the best protective action. If already trapped, this spell may be used to minimize the effect in certain cases. This is Sus. This is what it is. It's not the Sus guy. I know it has two meanings for you all, but I'm going to buy some rations because it's very important. I'm so excited. I really hope the internet holds up because this is like, I'm so ready for this. Small traders in the settlement supply the site master warriors with weapons, armor, food, and clothing. You go over.

48
00:29:42,599 --> 00:30:23,359
With the sergeant to a stall selling flatbreads and cheese, two gold paces per ration. The owner says, two boys, Andy, two boys, Andy. Let's haggle. You know who I am? I'm Anna land's greatest hero. You tell him the man looks uncomfortable. I know that. But I have to feed my family today. Whatever happens to the crown. I want to actually should probably buy a lot. You check your pack. There's room for plenty inside. I'll take four. I'll take six. I don't want to spend all my money. Maybe I should just spend all my money here. I'll take four. Four rations is eight.

49
00:30:23,359 --> 00:31:03,559
Gold paces, the man says, holding out a hand. It's too much. I just say it's too much. You're just going to lose him. Is it too much? Should I try to haggle? It's too much. The man shrugs and begins to pack away his stall. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I'll take two. I fucked it up. I'll take two. You hand over your coins and the man places two rations carefully into your pack. You must be sure you eat every day or you'll suffer. The sergeant points at the other guy that was talking and says, that's what you said. Standing

50
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:41,799
at your side, eating more will give you extra strength, but it's not necessary. This is just tutorial stuff. We have to go to the training grounds. I'm going to explain how fighting works because yes, you fight in this game. There's battling. It's like a fighting system. There's combat. Get excited. You walk with the sergeant to the training ground and he wraps the base of his staff in leather. Ready my sword. Here we go. To begin, the sergeant says, we will practice the stances. First, defend yourself against me. How this works is you can either defend and take one damage or try to

51
00:31:41,799 --> 00:32:20,509
overpower the other person. It's simply a numbers game, right? So let's say I decided to defend. I will always take one damage no matter what. If I get hit, turn the volume up, turn the volume up. It's a little too low. The problem is the sound mixing is not fantastic. So it will be some stuff is a little too, the music's a little too loud. So just be ready for music being loud. All right. So yeah. So if I defend right here and he attacks, right? We both defended. So nothing happens. It's pretty much like a rock paper scissors almost. The site master is a powerful enemy by defending. You will receive the

52
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:54,859
minimum damage from any attack he makes. Sight master sergeant defends himself as well. The round is a stalemate. I will now defend myself. Whatever attack you play will damage me, but a strong attack will use up more power. Choose a weak attack. So again, if I swing with one power and he defends, he's going to take one damage. If I swing with nine power and he defends, he still takes one damage. You always want to and if he attacks and I attack at the same time, it's just based on who has the

53
00:32:54,859 --> 00:33:33,849
higher number of power to the decimal. That's who takes the damage, right? So he's going to, I, he's, he said he's going to defend. I'm going to give him a little swing. It's going to do one damage. It'll always do one damage. All right. My next attack is going to be weak. You will be able to overpower me by playing a stronger attack, but be sure your attack is stronger, right? It has to be stronger. So if I do four, he did 1.8 bingo. You took two damage now. So what happens is when I swing for four, I lose four on the bar.

54
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:47,240
For the next turn, that's how it works. That's how it works. Here we go. All right. My next attack is going to be medium strength, but you will be able to overpower me. So let's go for it. Let's do the whole thing. And there he goes.

55
00:33:49,920 --> 00:34:12,820
Oh my God, my head. Oh my God, my fucking brain. Oh my God, my fucking head. That went into my brain. Okay. I didn't, I tell you about the sound mixing was off and I tried to make that clear that the sound mixing be careful.

56
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:43,739
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. The ear wig exploded. Okay. You play a strong attack. There he goes. All right. Enough training. I'm ready to do it. Here we go. You shake your head. Very good. The sergeant agrees. But if you wish about an earnest and I warn you, I will not go easy on you. He indicates the wider yard where there is a space for a true match.

57
00:34:43,739 --> 00:35:03,130
Um, Joe, I don't think I really need, I don't want to, I don't run. I don't have to fight him. Oh, Ernest, the most powerful Avenger. You want to do a true match. All right. I'll do it. Fine. Let's just so you can see how it works.

58
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:23,400
Let's go. Not going to tell you my intentions. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to go with a medium attack. Let's see if we get him. Fuck. And this is why I didn't want to do this. This is literally the reason why I didn't want to do this.

59
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:59,519
Cause now I have, I have 17 health. Does he heal you after? All right. All right. You can sometimes get an indication if you read what they're doing here. Sightmaster bows to you, taps the ground with his long staff, takes his position. You rush him quickly, conserving your energy while still delivering a great power behind your blade. The Sightmaster Sergeant comes in with a tough blow, balancing his strength and his impact. He slips the foot of his staff neatly under your blade. Yeah. All right. Let's go full power. Fuck it. There we go. Okay. Now I have to be careful, but he doesn't, he doesn't have much either.

60
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:43,630
You see his grip change on the heel of his staff as he readies himself to strike again. All right. Let's go full blast again. Yep. Just got him. Cool. His breath begins to heave. He is struggling to stay upright. He changes his grip to hold the staff more loosely. He seems to be preparing for a simple jab. Chance to overpower him. Do I have enough though? Oh, God damn it. I'm losing so much health already. He faints left. All right. I'm going to defend. Oh, fuck you. Now we go full blast. Okay. We're good. I got it.

61
00:36:46,539 --> 00:37:03,599
Acting quickly, you slash violently across his chest. It is enough to finish him. The Sightmaster throws down his staff. You have me. You have me. Six to him and a loss. Shameful. Oh, he does heal you. We're fine. Everyone shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

62
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:20,780
So if you have a chat delay right now, pause the stream and hit play again. Like do refresh the stream because that'll fix it because the frame drops that we had. I think we're still having them periodically, but it's all right.

63
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:38,510
Okay, the Sergeant is gasping for breath. He bows to you once more. You are too slow, he declares, shaking his head. I will tell the King to ready another champion for you will not survive long. As he talks, a nearby healer hurries over with a salve in your health and the Sergeant is quickly restored.

64
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:56,260
All right. Time to go to the gate. You reach the foot of the mighty gate. It is sealed. The Sergeant places one hand on the wood. The gate has been locked for some time to deter raiders, he tells you, but you will have no difficulty.

65
00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:24,539
Stars in this place allow the dot spell to be crafted and he stands back. It's time to cast our first spell. So again, the way this works. So you have to spell out a spell and in any scenario with a spell, you get potentially a few options, five options, two options, 10 options.

66
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:48,750
Sometimes it really depends. So what I have available to me right now is these letters first, right? You have to spit a three letter word. So I could I could zap the door. So it's uh, but this is going to take three health and it's going to be a disaster. Okay, this is going to be a

67
00:38:48,750 --> 00:39:05,900
fucking disaster. Like, let me just be honest with you. Um, there's also, I could do hot probably. Hot is throw a fireball. I'm probably going to kill somebody. Did I, I don't, I don't think I've ever done this before. Yeah, I know. All right. I'm going to throw a fireball at the fucking

68
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:24,670
door. You cast the spell winding a fireball around your palms. Then you release it at the door. The great wooden gate explodes in a flash of light. Sightmaster laughs grimly. We will have to rebuild that before the goblins raid us. But I am pleased to see you have power.

69
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:45,210
My apologies. Be assured I do or be silent before I blast you too. Why would I say that? I like this guy's like a friend. This guy's one of my friends. No, be assured. I do have power. Sergeant bows to you.

70
00:39:47,289 --> 00:40:13,699
A fucking waste of time. By the way, that was three health. I think Dopp is one. Let's go through the gate. Together you step into the wreckage of the gate. One last word, he declares. When you have the crown, find the highest point you can find. We will be watching.

71
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:54,190
Watching from where? From here. The Sightmaster warriors are selected from birth for their incredible powers of telescopic vision. You do not know how far he can see. What lies ahead? This path leads to Kanthapani, settlement of traitors. Though most are rogues and thieves. You should be there before the sun has reached its peak. From there, three routes lead on to Krista Tanti. But no single route is safe. Kakabad is a land of devils. Enough talking. It's time to go.

72
00:40:54,190 --> 00:41:34,059
Striding away, you pass through the gate. The faces of the folk watching your departure reveal the hopes that the- rest on your- I'm a terrible actor! The faces of the folk watching your departure reveal the hopes that rest on you and your quest. The early morning air is crisp, and the rising sun paints the slopes in shades of peaceful beauty, concealing the evil that lies ahead. On to Kakabad. It's time to begin the actual game. Are you guys ready for this? That was tutorial bullshit. This was tutorial bullshit.

73
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:56,000
Choices actually matter. There is a rewind feature, although people get mad when I use it. Let's fucking go. I'm- let's go, alright? Fuck the internet problems. This is the- let's go. It took us 30 minutes to get here, but I'm ready. And I'm here all day. Let's go. I'm actually really excited. On to Kakabad.

74
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:17,550
The path winds through slopes of wild scrubland. The countryside is deserted and the eerie silence is broken, only by the cawing of the occasional crow. The birds appear to pause in the air to examine you as they pass. They make you uneasy, as if you were an intruder in their presence.

75
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:33,440
Barely an hour beyond the wall, and the air begins to grow foul. The Sumatanti Hills are infested with the pestilence of the Baklans. It saps the energy from your body, leaving you feeling nauseous and weak. Cover my mouth.

76
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:52,340
You cover your mouth with your neck scarf, but it does no good. They warned you of this. You will grow accustomed to it the longer you are here, but for the moment you must be very careful. Your maximum stamina has just decreased. You can see your stamina at the top of the screen. If it reaches zero, you die.

77
00:42:52,340 --> 00:43:06,559
Stamina can be regained up to maximum by eating rations or resting. But yes, you die. This is how you die. And tons of things will kill you in this game. This is not safe.

78
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:22,809
Alright, first real choice of the game. We're going to let's take a look. We can take the road to Kantapani, but we can cross up through this Kantapani gate area and head up through this field area over here. Or we go this way. What do you think?

79
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:46,280
Should I stay on the road? Do click maps? I don't think we should do click maps. I think that might take a little too long. For really big major decisions, I think we could probably run poles that are like 30 seconds long, right? I'm going to stay on the road. A low rise road.

80
00:43:46,280 --> 00:44:00,630
Another hour passes and you crest a small hillock, from the top of which you can see the path continuing downwards into a small settlement of huts. This must be Kantapani. Look at the village. Look for a way around or move on. Look at the village.

81
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:18,769
From this distance, all you see on the town is its poverty. The fields on either side are brown with caked mud, and the few penned animals are thin and wizened like thirsty vines. No wonder the site master warriors don't trouble themselves to protect this place. There's nothing here to protect.

82
00:44:18,769 --> 00:45:09,469
Should we avoid the village or should we go into the village? What do you think? What do you think? Village, village, village, village, village, village, village. Go, go in, go in, go in, go in. Alright, let's go in. Of course. Let's make it so you can hear some of this stuff. I'm going to try to make it so it's not super loud when it changes, but be aware that it could get loud.

83
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:19,610
Of course, if you were scared of a town like Kantapani, then you could not hope to survive in Kakabad proper. You follow the path down into the town, obviously.

84
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:41,369
The round huts are made of a hard baked bright clay, and the roofs are thinly thatched. As you pass, eyes appear at dark doorways, tracking your every move. For a moment, it seems like this will be all you see of the town's inhabitants, but then a villager appears from one of the dwellings and blocks your path.

85
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:59,099
Look at him, threaten him, push him out of the way, or cast a spell. Here comes the zaps, right? Just, you want me to palpatine hands everybody I see? We can't just do a carbon copy playthrough of the one we did six years ago.

86
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:16,170
We can't just palpatine hands every person in the game. No, we can't do that. Threaten him. Alright, how about we just look at him first? We don't know who this is. We don't know what this person is. We don't know what they're capable of. We don't know why they're here.

87
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:41,030
They're standing in the road. Look at him. He is five feet tall. They cannot grow much taller out here, in this poisonous air. He has thick set arms and thighs, and is half clothed in tattered breeches. His eyes are wild, and his long red hair and beard stand out from his face in a wiry tangle.

88
00:46:41,030 --> 00:47:03,909
Hot, stranger, he commands. What business you have in Canterpani. I want to buy equipment. I'm merely passing through. I need directions. I'm a hungry traveler and need to eat. It's just you. I don't have a beard. Alright, what do you think?

89
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:21,940
But how about just like, oh, I need directions, right? Or I need equipment. I got money. I want to buy equipment. He grunts, but you can see that he is pleased. With emotion, he encourages you to follow, taking you through the village to a large hut, into the storage house.

90
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:40,039
Inside you find that the building is a storage house. A quartermaster, somewhat flumper than your guide, is seated at a table. No, am I going to kill this guy? I'm going to wait to be introduced.

91
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:59,360
This man here to do business, the villager explains. Get out of here, fruity. The fat man replies, getting up from his seat to hustle the villager out. Then he turns to you with a smile and beckons you to sit. Greetings, stranger. Shall I show you my wares?

92
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:26,690
Please, do you treat your customers so roughly? Same voice. Yeah, whatever. Please, please show me your wares. The man wags a finger. Wait there. He disappears for a moment into a side room. Search the room or just wait for him. What if he has cameras?

93
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:47,460
There might be cameras literally everywhere. While the man is out of sight, you quickly rifle the nearby shelves but find nothing except for a small vial of potion. Take it. You pick up the vial. It is quite full and stoppered by an old cork, but there's no label to indicate what it might be.

94
00:48:47,460 --> 00:49:09,800
Smell it or put it in your bag. Smell it. You slip back the stopper to take a cautious sniff. The smell is truly appalling and you seal it up again. Glimmberry? But what is it used for? The merchant returns carrying a large box.

95
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:26,809
For you. He declares moving his hands as he speaks. You've come to the right place. This collection is the very best. Our most strange and interesting artifacts. Collected from other travelers who've come this way.

96
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:40,659
He begins to lay the items in front of you, treating each with great care. You have 20 gold pieces to spend, but is there anything here you'd really want to buy? A musical pipe? A weapon? A leather bag? Or a jewel?

97
00:49:40,659 --> 00:50:12,889
What was that sound? What the fuck was that? A musical pipe? This actually is kind of important so maybe let's run a poll. 1, 2, 3, or 4. Do like a 30 second poll because this actually is important I think. Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe. What about jewel though? Jewel could be good.

98
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:25,920
I'm so happy that I'm sitting here right now. This is bringing back so many memories. I don't even remember doing any of this but maybe I did. I don't know. It's been like 7 years. I can't wait to continue with this.

99
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:54,849
How's it look? Pretty unanimous that we're going to go with one. Give it another 5 seconds or so. Musical pipe. Do I even have enough money to do this? Yeah, that's unanimous. Alright, we'll buy in one. Thank you for participating. A musical pipe.

100
00:50:54,849 --> 00:51:11,239
You pick up a bamboo pipe off the table carved with a split reed and 6 finger holes. 3 gold pieces, the merchant says. That's so cheap. Never mind, we can buy everything. I can't promise you that it has any magic, but it may well cheer you up at night. Play it.

101
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:34,699
You place the pipe on your lips and blow a few clear sweet notes. The merchant nods. It's a well made little thing, don't you agree? I just put it through my mouth and went like pew. He handed 3 gold pieces and he thanked you with a nod. You place the pipe into your bag. Please. The merchant says. Something else today.

102
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:50,159
You still have 17 gold pieces. How much is the jewel? Shreemur's choice. You reach greedily for the large jewel in the center of the box, but he stays your hand. Please, hey. It's too valuable to allow you to handle. 10 gold pieces.

103
00:51:50,159 --> 00:52:14,000
I have no use for valuable things. Look closer at the jewel or pay him. Look closer. You lower your eye to the table to peer more closely at the gem. It is clear, glassy, and its surface seems to be slightly sweating. If it is worth as much as you might hope, it could be useful for bargaining. Or you could keep it for yourself.

104
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:45,320
Dragon's tears. The merchant says. Never heard of such a thing before? It's an ice cube. Is it actually an ice cube? I don't remember. Did I ever go in this hut? It's literally an ice cube. But is it though? What if it's a magical ice cube?

105
00:52:45,320 --> 00:53:00,079
Alright, I won't buy it. No, I will not take it. The merchant nods. Very wise, I'm sure. He replies and puts the jewel carefully away. Very good. The merchant says, padding his money pouch. You're a man of good judgment, I see. What else?

106
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:23,130
About a weapon. What weapons do you have? The merchant looks at you carefully, sizing up what kind of customer you are, the kind to place a newly bought dagger against his neck, or the kind to tip him for the quality of the blade. But he must see your honor shining through as he wags his finger once more, and then collects an axe and a fine broadsword from another corner of the shop.

107
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,880
These are both treasures, as well as deadly weapons of war. Sure you'll agree?

108
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:34,179
Broadsword or axe? I mean, we gotta go axe, right?

109
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:47,690
You lift the axe from the table, the head is carved with symbols in a familiar language, but the quality of the shaft and head indicate that the axe is well used and may not last many more battles.

110
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,889
Seven gold pieces, declares the merchant.

111
00:53:50,889 --> 00:54:01,940
I mean, this thing's messed up, right? You give him this as a shitty axe, it's had a lot of wear, I don't think it's worth that much.

112
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:13,380
That price is too high for this, you reply. I'll give you five. The merchant looks uncomfortable, but eventually, with a glance around his large storehouse in this empty, unvisited village, he agrees.

113
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,860
Very well. Five. But it is my children who will suffer for it.

114
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:28,400
I'll take it, you reply, nodding once, you give him five gold pieces, put the axe into your pack.

115
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Please, take your time.

116
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,079
Keep looking.

117
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:42,480
I don't want to blow through all my money. Let's look at the leather bag. You lift a bag from the table and its contents rattle.

118
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,289
Teeth, the merchant replies, showing his own a little.

119
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:50,409
Minus creature teeth. Three gold pieces, too.

120
00:54:50,409 --> 00:54:59,860
What kind of creature? You ask, goblins, giants, or mole rats?

121
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,099
All sorts, the merchant replies.

122
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:08,340
I couldn't tell you myself, I'm no expert. But there's ten or twelve in there for three gold pieces, that's a good price.

123
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:19,030
It's a good price, I'll take it. I won't buy teeth without seeing them. It could be goblin teeth in here, I'll take it.

124
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,969
You hand over three gold coins and take the bag of teeth.

125
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:26,659
The merchant nods, then begins to pack his box away once more.

126
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:28,659
I must save at least something for my next customer.

127
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,659
He replies with a smile.

128
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,659
But perhaps you will return this way and it'll be you.

129
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:35,480
You get to your feet and take your leave from the merchant.

130
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Just outside the doorway in the sunshine, you pause to examine what you have acquired.

131
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,570
Let's examine the carvings on the axe head.

132
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:50,179
You'll tilt the axe head in sunshine to read the carvings on the metal.

133
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:53,420
This axe was crafted in the year of the ox...

134
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:59,909
Alright, there's like a pig talking to me.

135
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:05,079
This axe was crafted in the year of the ox for Glandragor the Protector.

136
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:08,449
Its powers may be realized only by its owner.

137
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:12,760
Interesting.

138
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Look in the bag of teeth.

139
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,070
You open the drawstring bag and sift through the contents.

140
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,070
It's quite an assortment.

141
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:26,070
There are three teeth from an ape, four from a goblin, two from a snatacat, and a large molar from a giant that is the size of a ripe plum.

142
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,420
That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

143
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,369
We got some materials now, but I ran out of money.

144
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:40,800
You head out of Cantapani and along the path into the Shumatanti Hills.

145
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,860
We did it. Pass Cantapani.

146
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,800
Passing the outlying huts, you feel strangely uneasy.

147
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,039
Hissings from within and sly faces disappearing from doorways make you feel decidedly unwelcome.

148
00:56:54,039 --> 00:57:01,159
Then at the edge of town, you pass a large boulder, and at once two rough-cut villagers spring out with swords drawn.

149
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,400
Bandits.

150
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,159
It's two against one, the first declares.

151
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,329
You lost, calls the other.

152
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:10,329
So hand over your things, come on.

153
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:13,019
Hand over your backpack.

154
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:18,440
Reason with them or deal with them.

155
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,980
Imagine handing over your whole backpack.

156
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,980
I wonder what this does. This must do something.

157
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,400
Deal with them.

158
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,960
You draw yourself to full height.

159
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,840
You have mistaken me for someone else.

160
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:39,639
I would like to give you a moment to reconsider, because I will kill you if I have to.

161
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,630
The bandits growl and advance on you, one on either hand.

162
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:59,349
We have LAW, which is control non-intelligent creatures.

163
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,349
Are they stupid enough to control?

164
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:05,599
Jig.

165
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,769
Cause lively dancing and I have the flute.

166
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:09,769
I could make them dance.

167
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:13,320
What else do we got?

168
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,539
Ball.

169
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:17,539
No, no, no. What is it?

170
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:18,539
F.

171
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:21,250
A.

172
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,250
L?

173
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,880
No, nothing there.

174
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,650
Fog.

175
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,650
Summon darkness.

176
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,360
Create a force field.

177
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,360
Should I just make darkness?

178
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,239
That's terrifying.

179
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:36,639
Make them dance?

180
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:39,579
I mean, right, come on.

181
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:40,579
That's the comedy routine.

182
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:41,579
All right, let's do jig.

183
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:51,300
You pull the bamboo flute from your bag, raise the spell, and begin to play a merry tune.

184
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:59,300
The angry faces of the bandits turn to expressions of astonishment as they find their limbs jerking in time to the music, quite out of control.

185
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:06,789
Their swords fly from their hands and they are soon dancing merrily around you.

186
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:10,789
Lead them back to the village or lead them to the nearest pit in the ground.

187
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:13,730
Just make them walk off a cliff.

188
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:23,969
Lead them to the nearest pit in the ground?

189
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:29,800
You want to pit these people?

190
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,289
All right.

191
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:35,289
The foothills around you are full of sudden drops, edges, and deep pits in the earth.

192
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:40,659
Piping loudly, you lead the two bandits to the nearest gap in the ground you can find.

193
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:51,030
Their expressions, already turning sour from exhaustion, move to looks of horror as they find themselves jumping and jigging on the edge of a pit.

194
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:56,840
Then, with a final leap and clap, they disappear over the side.

195
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,840
You put your murderous flute away and continue on your journey towards the hills.

196
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:06,449
About half an hour later, you reach the start of the climb into the hills proper and continue upwards.

197
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:11,570
That was horrible.

198
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:18,860
Have this running? It's an hour of occasional weight?

199
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,099
No, I don't want to take that.

200
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:28,699
All right. Well, there we go.

201
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:29,699
Climb into the hill.

202
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:33,840
Leaving Kanthapani behind marks the true start of the wilderness.

203
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:40,010
Beyond that tiny outpost, there are scattered homesteads and kar, a thriving city port.

204
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,320
But all are touched by cruelty, isolation, and fear.

205
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,750
The baklans and the long shadow cast by Mampang fortress darken everything.

206
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:55,199
And with the crown gone, stolen, things can only grow worse.

207
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:03,119
In the long years since Kalana the Reformer founded the Alliance, the crown has been passed from kingdom to kingdom every four years.

208
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,730
Ensuring each one has had its turn to lead, but no more.

209
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:15,579
Ruttlestone, Lenderland, Galantaria, and Bryce have all enjoyed its power, but not Analand.

210
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:21,699
But when the crown came to Analand, it was stolen by Birdman from Zamen and carried off to Mampang.

211
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:25,320
With the crown, the Archmage will be unstoppable powerful.

212
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,010
There's no chance of sending an army against him.

213
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,010
A military force would not survive the journey.

214
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:37,179
So here you are, a lone hero, walking the long path to Mampang alone.

215
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:40,119
Five minutes later, you reach a fork in the road.

216
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:45,440
The sergeant for all his eyesight hadn't mentioned this fork in the road.

217
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,059
Who is he talking to?

218
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:57,750
You're going to pull a who is he talking to right now?

219
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:02,630
I'm trying to get you immersed in the world of Analand.

220
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:07,019
Analand. Who is he talking to right now? Really?

221
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:16,280
Let's go. Fork in the road.

222
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,969
The road splits around the base of a gigantic tree, but does not rejoin on the other side.

223
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:27,639
The left path winds down into a valley, and the right rises up a slope towards the first thick forest of the hills.

224
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:34,429
It's hard to see much further uphill, though the forest is sudden and thick, and the path narrow.

225
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:38,800
It may be hard going in that direction, but the hills will involve a lot of climbing eventually,

226
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,480
and you make it a decent view of the next leg from the top of the ridge.

227
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,719
You pause to consider the lower route. There's a river there, and the path follows the left bank.

228
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:55,389
It's a safer route, secluded and protected, but the curve of the landscape would mean you were almost backtracking.

229
01:02:55,389 --> 01:03:00,820
You're about to make your choice when you hear a faint cry from somewhere close at hand.

230
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:08,360
Ignore it. It's a trap time to move or look around. Make your choice.

231
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:16,800
Look around. You look around, then finally, up into the branches of the tree,

232
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,800
a pair of wizened, calloused feet are dangling down over your head.

233
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,039
About to drop on you, perhaps? Throw something at the tree. Who's there?

234
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,760
Climb up. Just throwing a rock up at the tree.

235
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:39,489
You just grab a boulder and just hammer it up there.

236
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:44,059
Climb up. You want to just climb up? Climb up.

237
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:49,389
Climb up. You swing yourself up onto the lowest branch of the tree,

238
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:57,000
and the owner of the feet shrieks in alarm. You see it's an old man, dressed in rags and as thin as bone.

239
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,800
Oi! He calls, trying to retreat along the branch. What do you want?

240
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:09,400
A few branches above him, you notice a buzzing beehive.

241
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,579
Ignore the man and climb for the hive. Help the man down.

242
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:15,010
What are you hiding from? Where does he leave?

243
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:33,760
Fucking zap this guy. I kind of want the hive. Should I help him down?

244
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,920
Question. What are you hiding from?

245
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Actually, that's a good point, considering that, why is he up here?

246
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,679
What are you hiding from? Oh, the old man got up the tree as a puzzle.

247
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,849
He must have been escaping someone fearsome to climb so high.

248
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:51,409
What are you hiding from? You cry.

249
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:57,340
Down to Elvins. I was traveling from Dumpers to the outpost settlement in Analand.

250
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,340
But I was wayland by Elvins. Robbed me blind, all but took my eyes.

251
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,769
And left me up here in the tree. I keep getting older, you see.

252
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:11,570
We all do, but some worse than others. Climbed up, but now I'm too old to get down.

253
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:22,389
Help him out of the tree or just leave him. Let's help him out of the tree, right? Come on.

254
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:26,139
You reach up and grab the old man by the waist. He is as light as a leaf.

255
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:29,139
And within a moment, you've lifted him to the ground.

256
01:05:29,139 --> 01:05:34,510
Thanks for that, he remarks, brushing himself down and almost knocking himself over in the process.

257
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:40,630
Oh, I was just starting to get a bit, you know, perturbed. But I'm on the safe side now.

258
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:45,250
He seems remarkably confident, considering that the slightest stumble might break him into bits.

259
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:52,829
What will you do now? What do I get in return? Leave him. Climb higher and investigate the beehive.

260
01:05:52,829 --> 01:06:01,809
What will you do now?

261
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:08,289
Keep going for Analand, he says. That's where I set off from.

262
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:12,289
A while back now. You wouldn't believe the story if I told you.

263
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:18,530
Suffice to say, though, if I know my eyes from my eyes, you're heading up to Manpang and you'd better be smarter than I was.

264
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:24,079
And here. He presses a page into your hand. It is a page torn from a spell book.

265
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,070
This might be some use to you. I found this. I just found it.

266
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:32,070
Mine, I don't go asking how, but it's no good to me anymore.

267
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:35,199
Take it, refuse it, or look at it. Let's look at it.

268
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:42,440
You look the page over suspiciously. It seems to be half of a spell.

269
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:50,760
Ka, C-A. That might have been used for pest repulsion, but it is unworkable in its current state.

270
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:58,650
You take the page and thank him. Climb up to the hive.

271
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,599
Leaving the old man sighing with gratitude on the ground, you climb higher through the branches of the tall tree.

272
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:06,920
Up to the beehive.

273
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:13,400
The beehive hangs like a ripe fruit from the very highest branch.

274
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,030
A huge number of bees dance in and swarm out and about. Climb higher or use magic or give up.

275
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:23,840
Zap the beehive? Guys, I only have 10 health.

276
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:29,639
You get your balance enough to free your hands for a spell.

277
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:41,929
Big. Grow in size.

278
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:49,179
Zen. Hover in the air. I don't have the item.

279
01:07:49,179 --> 01:07:56,429
Zap. I can shoot. I can do Palpatine hand.

280
01:07:56,429 --> 01:08:04,599
Doze. Cause slowness.

281
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,030
Open locks and doors. That's interesting. Why can't I do that here?

282
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:17,539
Law. Control non-intelligent creatures.

283
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:20,539
That's three stamina though. I guess that would work, right?

284
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:25,100
I guess bees would be correct, right?

285
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:30,670
Open the beehive door. Go for law? Let's do it.

286
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:35,869
You cast the spell, concentrating on the swarm that surrounds the beehive.

287
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:38,869
You feel your mind taking control of theirs.

288
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:42,869
Several hundred small consciousnesses falling under your will.

289
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:47,359
You lead them like a general directing an army away from the hive.

290
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,539
Allowing you to clamor up and relieve them of a succulent honeycomb and a nice ball of beeswax.

291
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:56,359
That's a nice trick!

292
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:02,520
The old man remarks. You stash your finds in your pack. The light is fading. It's time to move on.

293
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,960
Oh!

294
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
The man cries suddenly.

295
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,199
Do you want to hear me, Riddle? I learned it from the Elvint.

296
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:13,600
Sure. You gesture with a hand for him to speak.

297
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,409
See him though he sees you're not. A stinging beast in a box not left.

298
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:23,409
To guard a key it is his lot. To gole a witch of luck bereft.

299
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:28,720
You thank him. You nod once and then you turn your attention to the path ahead.

300
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:37,380
All right. The high path or the low path? Where am I going?

301
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:43,779
I'm going through the forest here or over the road here on the low path.

302
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:54,680
Take the high ground. Take the high ground. High is fuck.

303
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,680
Low. High. High. High. High.

304
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:05,109
Follow the river. That'll take us down here.

305
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:07,109
All right. Let me get you. You got to get a big picture here.

306
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,989
The bees are swarming me.

307
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:14,989
This goes through the forest and into the mines here or potentially up through the river area up here.

308
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:24,800
This goes across potentially this big open field thing and then this little village or this village here.

309
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,800
Make sure you vote wisely because this is this is actually pretty important

310
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:37,899
because I don't if we go this way we cannot go this way.

311
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:44,720
The bees are attacking. I think they have decided.

312
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,720
It's close though. It's pretty close.

313
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,670
Which one was the high path? High path is right.

314
01:10:50,670 --> 01:11:01,560
Through this forest with a branch or like a fork in the road or up kind of more safely this way.

315
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,560
I don't know what's going on dude. I just voted for whatever.

316
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:11,760
I hope you're having a good time.

317
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,060
All right. They've decided.

318
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:19,060
Also have we had any F's? I keep I'm still dropping frames I think but has it been anything bad?

319
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:25,439
Are we good? Is it okay?

320
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,449
All right. All right. The high path. Let's go.

321
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:31,270
The high road seems the most secure.

322
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:35,270
In a valley you can be easily observed from above and lead astray.

323
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,439
But out on the hills you can go whichever way you choose.

324
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:42,680
Of course when night falls it may be cold and exposed up on the slopes but no matter.

325
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,989
This journey was never destined to be easy.

326
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:47,420
You begin to climb.

327
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,420
Letting the old man's jabbering fade quickly away.

328
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,420
He's still with us by the way.

329
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,920
The path winds upwards into the hill into the cover of a wood.

330
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,090
The afternoon sun glints through the trees and place tricks on your eyes.

331
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:05,460
Every so often you catch a glimpse of some strange shaped animal or other watching you.

332
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,960
Long to the find that it's the silhouette of branches and leaves caught at an odd angle.

333
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,640
After an hour's walk you're starting to feel hungry.

334
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,039
We eat one of our rations or do we keep walking?

335
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:20,090
I think we have to eat here.

336
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:25,189
You clamber to the top of a low stone dolmen.

337
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:28,489
Then sit and pull out the sugary honeycomb and eat.

338
01:12:28,489 --> 01:12:31,729
While admiring the view down the hillside through a break in the trees.

339
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:33,729
You feel better for your rest.

340
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,869
Keep that old man safe.

341
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,890
And move on.

342
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,890
You stand and put your pack on.

343
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:50,640
Which you had been sitting to prevent any creatures getting in or any of your things falling out.

344
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,010
Then you return to the path.

345
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,510
The climb continues with the path twisting this way and that.

346
01:12:55,510 --> 01:13:00,159
The air grows cold and the sun flickers on the horizon.

347
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,600
Then sets making it hard to see your way.

348
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,010
But the moon is full and when twilight is done it will be bright once more.

349
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,350
Keep walking or make camp.

350
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:22,439
Keep walking or make camp.

351
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,439
We do need to sleep.

352
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:29,609
We're at the point now where it is night time.

353
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:30,609
We do have the ape.

354
01:13:30,609 --> 01:13:33,819
Oh we can't do it yet.

355
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:38,130
I'm gonna camp.

356
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:41,130
But to tire yourself out on the first day would be inauspicious.

357
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,560
You settle down to make camp for the night.

358
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:49,439
In a natural shelter provided by the roots of three gigantic intertwined trees.

359
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,750
Your backpack will serve for a pillow and your cloak for a blanket.

360
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,369
Before settling to sleep you check through your pack.

361
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:57,609
You have two rations left.

362
01:13:57,609 --> 01:13:59,680
Gotta eat again.

363
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,039
Eat again?

364
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,939
Or just sleep.

365
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:08,460
Let's just sleep.

366
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,300
Oh shit.

367
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,300
Spoiler alert.

368
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,300
That was a problem.

369
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,920
You lay yourself out on the ground and are quickly asleep.

370
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:23,550
The moon has fallen high in the sky when you are next opening your eyes.

371
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,789
You feel warm and more cozy than you did before.

372
01:14:26,789 --> 01:14:29,220
As if wrapped in a gigantic blanket.

373
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,779
There is a pain in your leg.

374
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:36,390
Slowly you realize what is happening.

375
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:40,390
A giant bat has settled on your chest and is feeding on your leg.

376
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:45,659
Hurry.

377
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:55,260
Protect from magic.

378
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,909
So that's uh...

379
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:58,909
Protect from magic.

380
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:00,979
Big.

381
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:01,979
I can get huge.

382
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:04,500
I could do jig?

383
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Will this work on an animal?

384
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,960
Will this work on animals?

385
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,960
What if it doesn't work on animals?

386
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,609
This is free to do though.

387
01:15:16,609 --> 01:15:17,609
Let's do it.

388
01:15:17,609 --> 01:15:23,220
You raise the spell and play a sweet tune on the bamboo pipe.

389
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,460
The bat begins to hop absurdly from foot to foot.

390
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,460
Spinning around and holding out its wings.

391
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,829
You entertain yourself with the thing for a few minutes.

392
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:36,829
Then grab it in one hand and lob it away into the trees.

393
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:39,829
Where it takes flight not to return.

394
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:42,449
Smiling to yourself you settle back down.

395
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:46,479
I didn't know that that worked on animals.

396
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,899
You know what? I just like so long bowsered it into the trees.

397
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:57,170
Hopping on what?

398
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,170
You entertain yourself with the thing for a few minutes.

399
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:02,800
It was just feeding on my leg.

400
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:12,930
That's bad.

401
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:14,930
Man, imagine not getting the flute.

402
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,930
And there's a ton of scenarios where you just don't get it.

403
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:20,029
You just don't even go to Cantabani.

404
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:21,460
Jig is OP.

405
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
There are a lot of OP spells that you just won't get.

406
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:26,460
And sometimes I get no spoilers or anything.

407
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,470
You can get stuff taken from you.

408
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,710
So don't think that this is safe.

409
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:32,710
We gotta make the right choices here.

410
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,100
Once again the crown fills your dreams.

411
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,529
Only now instead of being hidden away in Mampang.

412
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:41,840
Fortress by the Archmage.

413
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,840
You see it on the head of the burly villager from Cantabani.

414
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,720
Anyone can wear the crown.

415
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,720
He declares to you.

416
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,960
But wearing the crown you are no longer just anyone.

417
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,640
And then he points a finger at you.

418
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,079
That seems to crackle with energy.

419
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:00,079
And you find yourself drawn towards him.

420
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:01,079
Commanded to do his bidding.

421
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:03,699
Suddenly you're surrounded by angry bees.

422
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:06,000
You're walking towards a crack in the ground.

423
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It seems sure to swallow you whole.

424
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You stumble at its edge.

425
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You're about to fall.

426
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,750
Having dreams of the bees the next morning.

427
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:24,119
The second day of your journey begins in the morning cool.

428
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,119
Still halfway between sleeping and waking.

429
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:28,119
You feel the presence of your spirit.

430
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:29,119
The ape.

431
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,359
Close nearby.

432
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,050
Its form has changed since you left Analand.

433
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,359
Just as you have changed.

434
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,850
But still walking beside you.

435
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:41,539
In the temple they taught you that a prayer to your spirit could heal disease.

436
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:42,539
Lift curses.

437
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:43,539
Even save you from certain death.

438
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:46,159
But the spirits are not generous.

439
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,399
And decline to help often.

440
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,119
You can now ask for aid with the pray button.

441
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:58,789
So this is interesting because over the course of the game you get certain gods that you pray to.

442
01:17:58,789 --> 01:18:01,789
And it changes based on what you do and your actions and stuff, right?

443
01:18:01,789 --> 01:18:04,159
So right now we have the ape.

444
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,779
A strong beast, intelligent and prudent.

445
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:09,779
Who takes great pride in acting faithfully.

446
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:11,079
To be depended upon.

447
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:16,560
During certain scenarios you can pray.

448
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,250
And the ape might help or might not.

449
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,750
It kind of depends on who it is.

450
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:28,380
You can feel yourself getting accustomed to the fetid air of these hills.

451
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,560
You've now ascended several hundred feet.

452
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,729
And can expect to make excellent progress.

453
01:18:32,729 --> 01:18:33,729
Before the end of the day.

454
01:18:33,729 --> 01:18:36,159
As you crest the brow of a hill.

455
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,159
You see something that makes you stop in your tracks.

456
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,720
To your left is a clearing.

457
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,899
And in the clearing are several poles.

458
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:43,899
Planted firmly in the ground.

459
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:46,140
And atop each pole is a head.

460
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:49,800
Look at the heads.

461
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,289
Or go.

462
01:18:51,289 --> 01:18:56,369
Whoa.

463
01:18:56,369 --> 01:18:59,600
Look at the heads or run.

464
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Look.

465
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,960
The heads are all kinds and ages.

466
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,960
Some are recently fixed while others have decayed.

467
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,960
And some are nothing but skulls and hair.

468
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,260
There are human heads.

469
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,439
Goblin heads.

470
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:17,930
And one or two heads of creatures you do not recognize.

471
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:19,930
All have sewn up eyes.

472
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,170
And mouths.

473
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:25,800
A large X painted on a rock nearby is obviously intended as a warning.

474
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,470
Not to venture any further.

475
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,470
But ahead the road forks.

476
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,470
Left and right.

477
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:34,470
And you cannot be sure which path you are warned not to take.

478
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,899
The right hand path continues to climb.

479
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:38,199
And the left hand path.

480
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,569
Wides down the side of the hill.

481
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:42,840
Very interesting.

482
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:56,789
You cannot cast directly from the book.

483
01:19:56,789 --> 01:20:02,189
I would cast it.

484
01:20:02,189 --> 01:20:07,460
Yawb.

485
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:12,430
Will summon a giant who the caster may control.

486
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,430
Oh my god.

487
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,430
I have a giant's tooth, right?

488
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:20,359
Blue.

489
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:21,359
Always very useful.

490
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:22,359
Doc.

491
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,359
Doc is useful.

492
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:30,239
Okay.

493
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,239
Which way are we going?

494
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:33,239
This is a chat choice, by the way.

495
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:34,729
I'm not going to decide this one.

496
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:39,470
I ain't going to decide this one.

497
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,729
Where are we going?

498
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:45,020
There is a warning.

499
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,020
You can look at it again.

500
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,840
A large X painted on a rock nearby is obviously intended as a warning.

501
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,840
Not to venture any further.

502
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,270
But ahead the road forks.

503
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,270
Left and right.

504
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,270
And you don't know what path you are warned to not take.

505
01:20:56,270 --> 01:21:01,479
A loud bird.

506
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:06,300
There you go.

507
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,300
Here you can see.

508
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,119
We have a path to a town.

509
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:14,550
Or a path up this way towards some mines and another kind of bridge area.

510
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:21,909
Leading up to another little settlement.

511
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:23,909
Chat, don't pick the obvious choice.

512
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:32,380
Where are we going?

513
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,380
What's winning?

514
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,130
This is close.

515
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,310
Come on.

516
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,310
Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.

517
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,760
What does prey do?

518
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,640
You can prey at any moment, but not right now.

519
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,640
The game essentially just told you what it does.

520
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:53,060
But if you prey in a random place, it'll heal you potentially or might do something bad.

521
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:56,810
During the course of the game, you'll get the option to prey.

522
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:59,119
And you know how it says, cast a spell.

523
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:00,119
Draw your weapon.

524
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,119
Prey is one of them.

525
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,119
And depending on who you have as a god, it might come and help you.

526
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,119
Or might mock you or might try to kill you.

527
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:08,640
We're going right.

528
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:14,100
Look at the items.

529
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:20,909
I have a spell book.

530
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:22,909
I have blimberry juice.

531
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:23,909
Blimberry juice.

532
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:24,909
I have beeswax.

533
01:22:24,909 --> 01:22:28,659
Goblin teeth, giant's tooth, and a bamboo flute.

534
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:30,989
I love this song too.

535
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:31,989
This song is so good.

536
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,210
Let me read this.

537
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:39,500
I don't know if I can use this right now.

538
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:45,670
What about treasures?

539
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,359
We got nine gold.

540
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:52,260
He plays this song in his car.

541
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,079
Everybody quiet.

542
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:55,319
Everybody quiet.

543
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:56,319
This is the part.

544
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:24,050
This is my favorite part.

545
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:39,180
God.

546
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,600
Okay.

547
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
That's such a good song.

548
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Are you shitting?

549
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,600
What?

550
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,600
All right, we're going right.

551
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,539
Yeah, I apologize for the little F's that are happening.

552
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:52,539
Sometimes it just happens and I'm not going to get angry about it.

553
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:54,539
I was angry about it an hour ago.

554
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:56,289
I'm not going to make it mad.

555
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:57,289
And when I say it, I'm not going to make it.

556
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:59,289
I'm not going to be mad about it, right?

557
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:01,720
It's just the way it is and I can't fix it.

558
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,720
We just have to hope it is not a problem.

559
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,720
I hope it's not been a problem.

560
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,720
I really hope it hasn't been.

561
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:13,770
I'll get angry.

562
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,460
Okay.

563
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:20,460
The climb continues up the hill for several hours until you are not far from the top.

564
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,470
Then the faint sound of bustling activity reaches you.

565
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:28,029
Flampling feet, grunting voices, and the clanking of metal against rock.

566
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:32,029
There's something ahead, hidden by the ancient trees that line these slopes.

567
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:34,970
Follow the sound or keep to the path.

568
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:45,170
Could be investigated.

569
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:46,170
Couldn't, but maybe not.

570
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,170
Or, I mean, we had a warning.

571
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,170
There was a warning.

572
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:52,500
But we do have zap.

573
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,500
We do have dop.

574
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,500
We do have sus.

575
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,600
What do you guys think?

576
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:04,640
I actually think I want to have another poll here because this is important, I think, either way.

577
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,640
I'm not sure.

578
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,069
I don't remember.

579
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:10,359
The theme's pretty divided as well.

580
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:12,359
So let's get a decision here.

581
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,539
We do have jig, too.

582
01:25:16,539 --> 01:25:17,539
We do have jig, too.

583
01:25:17,539 --> 01:25:22,779
But, you know, jig will only work if I have the ability to play the instrument.

584
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:33,220
Follow the sound or just stay on the path.

585
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:37,220
I would imagine the sound is this way and the path is the path.

586
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,220
And we can just keep going.

587
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:50,359
Path leads up here and the other thing leads in here.

588
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:52,359
You attempt to cast sus, but Jerma's the one playing sorcery here.

589
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:53,359
Not you.

590
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:54,359
That's funny.

591
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:58,020
I like that.

592
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,020
All right.

593
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,020
We're going to follow the sound.

594
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,520
It's unanimous.

595
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,460
Let's go.

596
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,460
Follow the sound.

597
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,640
You leave the path and continue through the woods.

598
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,810
A short distance onwards, you hide behind a tree and survey a clearing.

599
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:14,180
A number of goblins are in the clearing, working at the mouth of an open cave.

600
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:21,659
They trudge in and out of the opening, carrying large bowls in their arms piled up with glistening rocks and dull metallic nuggets.

601
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,220
Treasure.

602
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,640
Treasure.

603
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,640
Watch them work.

604
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,640
Leave them to it.

605
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:30,640
Make a break for the cave entrance.

606
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,819
I'm going to watch them.

607
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:36,319
You stay hidden, getting a sense of the scale of the operation.

608
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:41,630
There are at least 30 goblins inside the cave, each coming out every few minutes or so with

609
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:43,630
a new pail of stones.

610
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:48,189
Then there are other goblins working in the clearing with hammers, smashing the rocks

611
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,189
into small pieces, extracting metals from inside, loading them into carts, and finally

612
01:26:52,189 --> 01:26:57,119
pushing the carts away down a wide track between the trees.

613
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,119
It is quite some operation, but not without its weaknesses.

614
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:04,479
There are too many goblins to create any kind of distraction, but they move away into the

615
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:07,659
trees fairly often, and sometimes the cave is left unguarded.

616
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:10,670
Try to slip inside the cave.

617
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:16,119
Try to steal from the bowls, or leave and go back to the path.

618
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:17,119
Try to steal from the bowls?

619
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:20,680
I want to try to get, yeah, let's try to get some, I mean, there's probably like diamonds

620
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,680
in here.

621
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:29,300
You wait for the right moment, then leap out from behind the tree to snatch a little of

622
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
the glistening rock from the nearest bowl.

623
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:35,479
It's hard to pick out good metal from bad so fast, but you manage to lift a couple of

624
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:36,479
pieces worth of gold.

625
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:38,479
But your actions have not gone unnoticed.

626
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:51,520
You're quickly surrounded by three goblins, all armed with picks and ready to use them.

627
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
All right, we don't have access to Jig.

628
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,279
But we got Zap.

629
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,090
We also have rap?

630
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:01,210
Talk all languages.

631
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,210
Oh, shit.

632
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,090
Okay.

633
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:06,090
Raz, sharpen your blade.

634
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:12,770
No, hot either.

635
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:13,770
I don't have access to it.

636
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:15,649
I'll zap.

637
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:16,649
Let's go for it.

638
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:20,300
Time to create some lightning, guys.

639
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:25,100
For the first time in seven years, I'm about to cast Zap.

640
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:31,670
You cast the spell and point at the nearest goblin.

641
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:36,670
A streak of lightning shoots from your finger and catches the creature squarely in the chest,

642
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:38,670
killing it instantly.

643
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,869
The smoke clears.

644
01:28:41,869 --> 01:28:52,149
The second goblin, enraged, rushes into attack before you can raise the spell again.

645
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:54,670
There it is.

646
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,119
All right.

647
01:28:57,119 --> 01:28:59,119
So I got a much bigger stamina bar.

648
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:00,119
We're going to just go about...

649
01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:01,119
Let's go six.

650
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,800
Yeah, that's all right.

651
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
That's all right.

652
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,680
The second goblin growls and gnashes its teeth, then throws away its pick and snatches up

653
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,680
a shovel.

654
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,979
This one you realize is vicious and an idiot.

655
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:16,979
You strike for its head.

656
01:29:16,979 --> 01:29:19,979
The goblin raises his shovel and hides under the blade.

657
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:23,140
Get out of here.

658
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:26,760
You push forward, showing no mercy, leaping over a cart.

659
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,760
You drive your blade straight for his throat.

660
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,760
The blow connects and the creature falls down to the dirt, dead.

661
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:42,770
There's no time before the third goblin's on you.

662
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:46,739
Let's go another full blast here.

663
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:47,739
It's all right.

664
01:29:47,739 --> 01:29:53,069
This third goblin is bigger than the others and furious at the death of his comrades.

665
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:55,069
He paces forward menacingly.

666
01:29:55,069 --> 01:29:59,069
You show him the force of your blade and the goblin jumps quickly back.

667
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:01,069
He escapes largely unscathed.

668
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:05,439
From arm's length, he hisses and glows.

669
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,439
Full blast.

670
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:08,439
Kill him.

671
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:11,279
Dead.

672
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:12,279
You strike again with vicious force.

673
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:13,279
It is the final blow.

674
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:15,279
The goblin drops to the dust.

675
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:16,649
The clearing falls quiet.

676
01:30:16,649 --> 01:30:22,800
Search the bodies or get out of here.

677
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:31,920
And there's like 40, this is what, 30 goblins here?

678
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,359
All right, I'm going for it.

679
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,560
You quickly rifle the bodies.

680
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,560
There are two gold pieces, a pathetically small sum to be killing for.

681
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,369
There are also eight goblin teeth lying around.

682
01:30:42,369 --> 01:30:44,369
Oh my God, take them.

683
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:45,800
I have 10 goblin teeth.

684
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,800
I can make a whole army soon.

685
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:52,619
Working quickly, you gather up the teeth and add them to the bag you bought at Cantapani.

686
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:54,880
That's done.

687
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,880
It's time to move on.

688
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,439
There'll be other goblins here soon enough.

689
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:01,439
You've been lucky that you have emerged from the woods while you were dispatching these.

690
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:08,619
Quickly, you hurry back into the trees, leaving the mine behind you, continuing on along the path with the tall trees at either side.

691
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:10,369
How many teeth do I have?

692
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:16,640
I have 12 goblin teeth.

693
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,640
Oh my God.

694
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,640
All right.

695
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,640
That's actually insane.

696
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,100
That's actually insane.

697
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,810
All right.

698
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:28,229
The bridge.

699
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:32,229
Follow a path that leads sharply downhill into a narrow valley in which a stream runs.

700
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:36,409
There's no path along the bank, but there is a bridge.

701
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:37,590
Cross it.

702
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:38,590
Inspect the ropes.

703
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:41,939
Find another way.

704
01:31:41,939 --> 01:31:42,939
Stop collecting teeth.

705
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:45,079
I need them.

706
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:49,180
Let's take a look.

707
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,180
You test the ropes.

708
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,180
They seem to be firm.

709
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:55,550
If this is a trap, it's not one that will dump you into the stream, but you could always

710
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:59,550
struggle through the vegetation on the bank and try to find a fording point.

711
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:02,260
I'm going to use the bridge.

712
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,720
Let's use the bridge.

713
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:13,630
Moving slowly and with one hand on your sword hilt, expecting the boards to give way at

714
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:16,319
any moment, you inch across.

715
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,989
The bridge holds and you reach the other bank quite safely.

716
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:23,989
You now have a long walk ahead of you along the ridge and through a light covering of trees.

717
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:25,289
So that was the right thing to do.

718
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:33,399
This would have been probably a disaster.

719
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:47,020
Long walk here to further on, which is over here.

720
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,390
The path climbs again up a low hill, covered over with thick bushes and shrubs that snag

721
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:52,390
at your clothing.

722
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,930
Halfway up, you hear a sound.

723
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:56,300
Twigs breaking.

724
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,560
Freeze.

725
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,890
You freeze as a large creature the size of a bear emerges directly in front of you.

726
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:09,130
It has black and white fur and a long bushy tail that trails out behind.

727
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,130
It growls menacingly.

728
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:18,159
Oh no, it just snagged again.

729
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,159
Prepare to attack or try to edge around it.

730
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:32,250
Should I go for it?

731
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,840
I'm going for it.

732
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:41,770
How hard could it be?

733
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:45,569
I'm going for it.

734
01:33:45,569 --> 01:33:46,569
Prepare to attack.

735
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:50,159
You will not be able to avoid a confrontation.

736
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:55,399
The creature is a skunk bear and when it raises its tail, it releases a nauseating odor.

737
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:57,760
The smell that hangs around is terrible.

738
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:02,329
Let's get a...

739
01:34:02,329 --> 01:34:03,329
What can I do here?

740
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:05,340
Wow.

741
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,340
All right.

742
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,340
There's some weird things here.

743
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,420
What about sap?

744
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,420
Cause depression.

745
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:16,859
Six.

746
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:17,859
Clone the caster.

747
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:23,979
So I just clone myself and go, you go do it.

748
01:34:23,979 --> 01:34:29,699
Nap.

749
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:30,699
Cause sleepiness.

750
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:31,699
I don't have the item.

751
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:39,359
Nothing with K. Law.

752
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:40,359
Yeah.

753
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:41,359
This is very expensive though.

754
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:42,359
Control non-intelligent creatures.

755
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:49,470
Is it non-intelligent?

756
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:51,470
I wonder if this is a bad idea.

757
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:55,649
That's a lot of stamina.

758
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:57,720
I think that's too much.

759
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,720
I'll do six.

760
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:07,520
Let's do...

761
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,689
Let's clone ourselves.

762
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:09,689
That's only one.

763
01:35:09,689 --> 01:35:10,689
Let's do it.

764
01:35:10,689 --> 01:35:16,640
You cast a spell and in a flash, five replicas of yourself appear in front of the creature.

765
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:21,640
The confused beast lurches forward to attack one of them and you use the opportunity to

766
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:25,640
escape, leaving your magic clones to fight your battle for you.

767
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:29,130
The path leads down through another valley and back up a hill.

768
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:31,130
Two hours pass.

769
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:41,630
The worst part about that though is I don't get any loot for that.

770
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:42,630
I don't get any loot for that.

771
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:43,630
I just run.

772
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:47,979
Oh, and I didn't see what was up here.

773
01:35:47,979 --> 01:35:49,859
Yeah, it's all right.

774
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:51,229
All right.

775
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:55,729
We're going to be approaching Christa Tonti now.

776
01:35:55,729 --> 01:35:57,729
I want to see where we've gone so far.

777
01:35:57,729 --> 01:36:00,800
And by the way, I want to make sure people understand something here.

778
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,800
This is very important.

779
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,430
You know Elden Ring?

780
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:08,510
You ain't seen fucking anything yet.

781
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:16,060
This game is so overwhelmingly large that you're going to get Elden Ringed here in a

782
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,060
minute.

783
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,430
I just want to make sure you understand that.

784
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:19,430
You're about to get...

785
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:21,430
Pretty soon here, you're going to get Elden Ringed.

786
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:22,430
I just want to make sure you know that.

787
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:28,760
Let's go to Christa Tonti.

788
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:38,359
The sun has now just passed its zenith and everywhere a dusty heat rises from the baked

789
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:39,850
earth.

790
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:40,850
You begin to think about where you will stay for the night.

791
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:44,090
Another night sleeping out in the open would be best avoided.

792
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:49,359
But then you see a small village set into a hill.

793
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:51,359
Smoke rises from the stacks.

794
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:55,600
The houses are well set with stone at their bases and thatched roofs of grasses and thick

795
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,840
leaves.

796
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:01,840
There is unusually more than just the one street running through the center of town.

797
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,960
It's as though this place, once rich, has had its heart scooped away.

798
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,960
Litter surrounds the buildings and on the edge of the village are rows and rows of empty,

799
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,590
abandoned houses.

800
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:19,539
You continue your slow trudge along the path.

801
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:21,159
Okay.

802
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:23,529
Into the village or avoid the village.

803
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:29,420
As you can probably understand, avoid the village is going to take us this way.

804
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,420
Into the village is going to go in the village.

805
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:40,939
Let's get a decision from Chat here.

806
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:45,359
You're going to get mugged in this village.

807
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:53,609
Oh, they stumped us.

808
01:37:53,609 --> 01:37:54,609
What do you guys think?

809
01:37:54,609 --> 01:38:00,680
We going in or we going around?

810
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,680
We going in.

811
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,680
We going around.

812
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,680
Around the village or in the village?

813
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:11,829
Please go to Dumpus.

814
01:38:11,829 --> 01:38:12,829
Well, we'll find out.

815
01:38:12,829 --> 01:38:25,869
Expand your influence.

816
01:38:25,869 --> 01:38:28,039
Avoid Dumpus or Riot.

817
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:29,039
Dumpus or Riot.

818
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,409
Well, Jerma, when are you going to play Genshin?

819
01:38:31,409 --> 01:38:32,409
I'm sick of it.

820
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:34,609
I'm not going to play Genshin Impact.

821
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:38,609
I told you I played it for like an hour in bed on the iPad and it was overwhelming to me.

822
01:38:38,609 --> 01:38:51,500
All right.

823
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,119
What's the verdict?

824
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:54,750
That's unanimous.

825
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,750
Let's go.

826
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:58,760
We're going into Chrisitanti.

827
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,960
Here we go.

828
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,710
You walk into the village.

829
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:07,880
Young hill dwellers pass you and stare at your strange clothes.

830
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,880
You nod back respectfully.

831
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,079
Look at the people.

832
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:14,710
Their own attire is rough by comparison to your gear.

833
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,880
They wear their hair long but piled up on their heads.

834
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,060
These people are ghastly poor.

835
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:24,359
The village is like a ghost town here on the knife edge of the backlands.

836
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:27,880
Talk in the ale house or go to the inn.

837
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:32,810
Let's go to the ale house.

838
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:33,810
I want to go in here.

839
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:43,750
Walking down the single road you quickly find a hut with its front covered hold wide open

840
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,750
and the smell of brewed beer coming from inside.

841
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,920
You go in.

842
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,100
Several hill dwellers are here talking gruffly.

843
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,279
When you enter they watch you with understandable caution.

844
01:39:54,279 --> 01:40:02,079
The owner of the hut comes over to you.

845
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,350
Welcome to Chrisitanti.

846
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:06,350
What do you want?

847
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:11,510
Read the owner or ignore him and sit with the dwellers.

848
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:12,750
Say hello.

849
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,949
An evening's rest and a drink to wet my throat.

850
01:40:15,949 --> 01:40:16,949
You reply.

851
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:19,890
Hell is one gold piece.

852
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:20,890
Please sit.

853
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:23,579
You go over to the table where the hill dwellers are.

854
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:26,329
Sit with the old man, sit with the young man.

855
01:40:26,329 --> 01:40:27,960
Two voice Andy.

856
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,960
That's the way it is, alright?

857
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,909
Hold.

858
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:34,909
You turn your attention to the oldest man at the table.

859
01:40:34,909 --> 01:40:38,279
Whatever face he once had is lost in a labyrinth of wrinkles.

860
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:43,279
And his skin is the color of tanned hide from a lifetime of the beating sun.

861
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:46,180
What are you looking at?

862
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:51,930
The old man's face curls up like burnt paper into a kind of smile.

863
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:55,199
Don't get too many travelers around here.

864
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,369
So I'm looking at you.

865
01:40:57,369 --> 01:40:59,119
Where are you from?

866
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:03,369
I come from Analand.

867
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:04,369
Hmm.

868
01:41:04,369 --> 01:41:08,810
Not many has crossed through Cantapani Gate.

869
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:12,550
In either direction, if you know what I'm saying.

870
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,550
You should go and look.

871
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:17,770
The gate has exploded.

872
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:21,510
Like what?

873
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,510
Like I didn't do that?

874
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,510
You should go and look.

875
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,510
The gate exploded.

876
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:26,260
You grin widely.

877
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:30,819
If they haven't fixed it, you might be able to get in at last.

878
01:41:30,819 --> 01:41:34,640
The old man laughs.

879
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,939
Now my place is here.

880
01:41:37,939 --> 01:41:40,119
They say there's a war coming.

881
01:41:40,119 --> 01:41:42,359
Something to do with a crown.

882
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:44,939
I seek that crown.

883
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:45,939
Not if I can help it.

884
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:46,939
A crown?

885
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:49,510
Crown?

886
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,510
You ask cautiously.

887
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:53,260
The crown of kings.

888
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:55,500
They say it's how a leader leads.

889
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,680
Without the crown on your head, no one will follow you.

890
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,979
The crown can raise an army from the farmyard.

891
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:05,979
Or command a population to walk into the sea.

892
01:42:05,979 --> 01:42:08,539
Sounds like a bad idea, if you ask me.

893
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:14,399
But if someone's got to wear it, I'd rather they were in Anna Land than Manpang.

894
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:15,770
You sip your beer.

895
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:19,770
The old man exchanges glances with the younger man sitting opposite.

896
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:22,550
Talk to the young man.

897
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:23,550
Ask the old man about the area.

898
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:28,279
Can you tell me something about this region?

899
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:29,279
You ask.

900
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:30,520
Christa Tanti?

901
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,520
Certainly.

902
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,520
I'll tell you that around here, we're always glad to help out strangers.

903
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:39,170
I think you're a crazy old man.

904
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:41,989
Tell me what lies beyond this town.

905
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:46,810
What lies beyond this town?

906
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:50,439
Beyond Christa Tanti, there are two paths.

907
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:52,680
One takes you past Aliana's home.

908
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,920
And you will need your wits about you if she's there.

909
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,350
The other leads up into the hills of Liyaki.

910
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,720
Domain of the great ones.

911
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,720
Either way you choose.

912
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,720
I wish you the luck of Sindler on your journey.

913
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:09,430
The god changed, by the way.

914
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:15,079
We have the monkey now, not the ape.

915
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:17,840
No one talks like this.

916
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,840
Yes, they do.

917
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,840
All old men talk like this in fantasy literature.

918
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,840
And fantasy movies and TV shows.

919
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,840
We all talk like this very, very theatrically.

920
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:40,250
I'm not going to pray.

921
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,250
Okay, intelligent but cheeky.

922
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,250
The monkey understands others but does not respect them.

923
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:48,560
He is quick to turn his tail, but not rash.

924
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,560
What he lacks in courage he makes up for in caution.

925
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,229
Yeah, we're getting some Fs here.

926
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,170
More than usual.

927
01:43:57,170 --> 01:44:08,050
We're getting a few Fs here, more than usual.

928
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:16,760
There are no Fs?

929
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,760
Oh, there definitely are right now.

930
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:25,350
Let's see if we can write it out for a sec.

931
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:31,399
I have a little thing that shows the amount of frames that are dropping.

932
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:35,579
We've dropped like 500 or 600 in the last 30 seconds.

933
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:37,840
Okay.

934
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,710
All right, so here we go.

935
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:42,710
We have the monkey.

936
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,520
Who is Sindler?

937
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,520
He says pray to Sindler.

938
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,520
I'm going to ask that.

939
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,520
Who is Sindler?

940
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:51,680
Who is Sindler?

941
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,369
God of hopeless causes.

942
01:44:54,369 --> 01:44:56,369
The man replies and laughs.

943
01:44:56,369 --> 01:44:58,369
The crowd in the inn is starting to thin out.

944
01:44:58,369 --> 01:45:03,090
You finish your beer in a single drought and get to your feet.

945
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:05,520
You make to leave the inn.

946
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,520
The owner stops you holding out his hand.

947
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:13,800
Pay him a gold piece or knock him aside.

948
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:22,539
The frame dropping is not a big deal when it's stationary.

949
01:45:22,539 --> 01:45:23,539
Yeah, that's true.

950
01:45:23,539 --> 01:45:24,539
That's true.

951
01:45:24,539 --> 01:45:25,840
I'll just stop.

952
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,840
I'll stop talking about it.

953
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:34,180
It just it like burns a hole in my head looking over there and seeing frames drop and being like fuck.

954
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,180
That's true though.

955
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,550
It shouldn't be that big of a deal.

956
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:37,550
All right.

957
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:38,550
I'm going to pay.

958
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:40,430
I'm not going to be a dick.

959
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:42,859
You pay him his gold piece and step out into the street.

960
01:45:42,859 --> 01:45:43,859
You look this way and that.

961
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:46,479
Trying to decide what to do next.

962
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:48,479
When you realize the old man has joined you once more.

963
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:50,789
He ignores you and is gone.

964
01:45:50,789 --> 01:45:53,409
It's now evening and time to sleep.

965
01:45:53,409 --> 01:46:01,439
We're going to find the inn.

966
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:07,430
You stop a passerby and ask for an inn.

967
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:09,430
And they lead you there directly.

968
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:12,729
The woman who runs the place stands in the doorway with her arms folded.

969
01:46:12,729 --> 01:46:14,609
Are you from the king?

970
01:46:14,609 --> 01:46:15,609
She demands.

971
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:19,180
No, I'm a traveler.

972
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,180
I am on a mission for the king.

973
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:27,600
We're getting a party of old men.

974
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:36,550
Do I just lie?

975
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:38,239
No, I'm a traveler.

976
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,239
I don't want to give attention to myself.

977
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,859
No, I'm a mere traveler.

978
01:46:41,859 --> 01:46:44,289
The woman narrows her eyes at you.

979
01:46:44,289 --> 01:46:45,289
This is a guest house.

980
01:46:45,289 --> 01:46:48,109
The best in Christa Tante.

981
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:49,109
Only guests stay.

982
01:46:49,109 --> 01:46:54,840
And any guest of mine knows it cost me three gold pieces to host a man of a night.

983
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,840
And two to feed him.

984
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,640
But it's all between friends.

985
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:08,140
Uh, two gold?

986
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:09,140
Three?

987
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,140
Three gold?

988
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:17,270
Why is...

989
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:18,890
Hold on.

990
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:21,800
Hold on a second.

991
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,550
Hold on a second.

992
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:27,000
Hold on a second.

993
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,180
Oops.

994
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,180
Oops.

995
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,180
I have to do something real quick.

996
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:31,180
Very quickly.

997
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:32,180
Give me one second.

998
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,180
Give me a second.

999
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:38,260
Okay.

1000
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:40,399
Sorry about that.

1001
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:41,399
Yeah.

1002
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:48,770
I had to remove something from my, um, from my channel description.

1003
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:51,520
Thank you for the heads up, by the way.

1004
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:56,899
I did not even know that was still there.

1005
01:47:56,899 --> 01:47:57,899
That's so funny.

1006
01:47:57,899 --> 01:48:00,550
Oh, all right.

1007
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:02,359
What were we doing?

1008
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:03,920
Right.

1009
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,829
This.

1010
01:48:06,829 --> 01:48:07,829
All right.

1011
01:48:07,829 --> 01:48:08,829
I'll take a room.

1012
01:48:08,829 --> 01:48:11,090
Should I eat though?

1013
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:12,840
I should eat.

1014
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,840
I need to eat first.

1015
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,840
Food is just being served.

1016
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,840
The woman steps aside and you go inside and sit down.

1017
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:24,010
A few minutes later, her husband appears with a steaming pot of skunk bear stew.

1018
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:28,250
As you eat, you can't help but remember the terrible smelling beast dead on the path.

1019
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:30,680
And the thought makes you gag.

1020
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:34,119
You wolf it down all the same and leave your coins on the table.

1021
01:48:34,119 --> 01:48:35,119
Do you want a room as well?

1022
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:40,029
Um, yes, I do.

1023
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:41,460
Thank you.

1024
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,460
The woman shows you the way upstairs to a room.

1025
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:46,699
There are three other guests already staying and asleep.

1026
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:47,880
So you settle quickly.

1027
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,880
The bed is not clean, but it is comfortable.

1028
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:58,300
And after a long day and all its narrow escapes, you're grateful beyond measure for the rest.

1029
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,539
Your dreams are vivid once again.

1030
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:01,539
You're walking endlessly.

1031
01:49:01,539 --> 01:49:04,539
The hills moving up and down under your feet like a rippling sea.

1032
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:09,020
Every step exhausts you, but no step moves you forward.

1033
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:15,439
Meanwhile, a tall black creature strides towards you, breathed in a foul smelling smoke.

1034
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:18,939
And in the distance, a deep voice is booming with laughter.

1035
01:49:18,939 --> 01:49:24,560
The long, cruel fingers of one hand are curled around the metal frame of a crown.

1036
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:34,399
With the other, he beckons you forward as if into a trap beyond Christa Tonti.

1037
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:38,489
There's just one dog barking.

1038
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:49,319
Let's continue.

1039
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:52,319
You wake early and sit for a moment in no great hurry to leave the village.

1040
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:57,319
This is now the third day of your journey, and the muscles in your legs are feeling lean and strong from so much walking.

1041
01:49:57,319 --> 01:50:05,000
You spend a short while enjoying the peace, then unhurriedly collect your possessions and set off along the path.

1042
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,300
Christa Tonti is surrounded by several miles of fields, sits in a well-protected ring of hills,

1043
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,300
and is close enough to the river to be reasonably prosperous.

1044
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:16,729
As you follow the path between lines of sun-baked crops, you come to a fork in the road.

1045
01:50:16,729 --> 01:50:19,729
The right-hand way leads past a set of outbuildings,

1046
01:50:19,729 --> 01:50:22,970
while the left heads directly off into deep woodland.

1047
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:26,260
Let's decide.

1048
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:28,329
Where are we going?

1049
01:50:28,329 --> 01:50:33,239
Between the buildings up this way or in the woods?

1050
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:37,079
This will lead us through here to the Leakey.

1051
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:39,699
This is a ruined town, by the way.

1052
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:48,569
Or through the woods, potentially to into the forest and potentially over to Dampus.

1053
01:50:48,569 --> 01:50:56,649
We might be able to get to Dampus if we go up, or it might head us this way over the river.

1054
01:50:56,649 --> 01:51:07,090
Where to?

1055
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:08,090
Dampus.

1056
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:09,270
Well, that's up to you.

1057
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:13,489
That is up to you.

1058
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:23,239
You're probably wondering what that was.

1059
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:26,420
I had to just refresh my Twitch TV.

1060
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,430
Hold on.

1061
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:29,430
That wasn't in the game.

1062
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:36,439
I had to refresh my Twitch page and move it over here.

1063
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:43,000
All right.

1064
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,810
Let's do it.

1065
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:45,810
That's pretty unanimous.

1066
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:48,369
Into the woods we're going.

1067
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:49,369
Towards Dampus.

1068
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:56,899
Your journey is too important to slow down talking to locals.

1069
01:51:56,899 --> 01:52:02,079
You must pass unseen, and so you disappear into the jungle of all tall trees.

1070
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:04,640
For a short while the sun is fervorous.

1071
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,069
Feverous, even.

1072
01:52:07,069 --> 01:52:09,069
And then you are between the trees once more,

1073
01:52:09,069 --> 01:52:11,069
and everything becomes cool and still.

1074
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:14,500
You walk for several hours uneventfully.

1075
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,800
This land that was never settled or explored, and very few travel this way.

1076
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,619
In places, bushes and shrubs have grown over into the path.

1077
01:52:23,619 --> 01:52:34,779
Hack your way through or move cautiously, just wildly swinging your fucking sword.

1078
01:52:34,779 --> 01:52:36,779
We just gotta go nuts through it, I think.

1079
01:52:36,779 --> 01:52:37,779
Yeah, hack away, hack.

1080
01:52:37,779 --> 01:52:42,979
Moving carefully forward, you use your sword to cleave the bushes.

1081
01:52:42,979 --> 01:52:44,979
Your progress is quick, but silent.

1082
01:52:44,979 --> 01:52:47,350
Then you come to a fork in the road, still deep in the forest.

1083
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:50,550
Fork in the forest.

1084
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:52,550
Uh-oh, it's decision time.

1085
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:54,789
I don't know what's gonna happen here.

1086
01:52:54,789 --> 01:52:58,460
Chad, I don't know.

1087
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:02,699
It's either on to Dampus, or creepy hut in the forest.

1088
01:53:02,699 --> 01:53:04,449
That's gonna be a tough one.

1089
01:53:04,449 --> 01:53:08,800
Someone has thought to make a sign.

1090
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,800
Perhaps as a guide, or perhaps as a warning.

1091
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:15,109
The way to the right is marked for Dampus.

1092
01:53:15,109 --> 01:53:17,479
A left turn points to Aliana.

1093
01:53:17,479 --> 01:53:20,720
A name you remember from what the man in Christa Tonti told you.

1094
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,149
Neither way seems the better, Trod.

1095
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:24,149
You will have to choose.

1096
01:53:24,149 --> 01:53:27,859
To Aliana, or to Dampus.

1097
01:53:27,859 --> 01:53:32,939
Make your choice.

1098
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:43,630
It's time to go to the shack.

1099
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:45,380
Or Dampus.

1100
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:48,859
Get the dumpy.

1101
01:53:48,859 --> 01:53:52,319
I don't know.

1102
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:54,960
I don't remember.

1103
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:01,229
Because if we go this way, there's also probably a possibility that we can still go to Dampus.

1104
01:54:01,229 --> 01:54:07,630
Or it might take us out into this fork, and we have to choose again.

1105
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:11,000
Which might lead you still to Dampus, but could also go this way, too.

1106
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
And up here.

1107
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,880
Alright, what are we doing?

1108
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,699
We're going to Aliana.

1109
01:54:18,699 --> 01:54:19,699
Pretty unanimous.

1110
01:54:19,699 --> 01:54:29,340
The path winds between trees that get greener and more lush.

1111
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:33,880
You must be closer to the river here, although you cannot hear the water.

1112
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:39,680
After about half an hour's walk through dappled shade, you come across a well-built hut.

1113
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:45,239
Flowers decorate its walls, and the door has been painted with ornate designs.

1114
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:46,680
The path ends here.

1115
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,750
Knock on the door.

1116
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:51,520
Scout around it.

1117
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,390
There's a knock on the front door, right?

1118
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:56,520
Just go knock.

1119
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,810
You approach the door and knock.

1120
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,119
There is no reply.

1121
01:55:02,119 --> 01:55:07,020
Scout around it or turn back or open the door.

1122
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,689
Scout around it?

1123
01:55:10,689 --> 01:55:12,189
Let's scout around it.

1124
01:55:12,189 --> 01:55:17,260
You perform a swift circuit around the hut, but find nothing unusual or concerning.

1125
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:20,010
It seems to be what it is.

1126
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:22,319
A hut, set by itself deep in the forest.

1127
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:27,680
But for someone to survive out here on their own, surrounded by the beasts of the jungle,

1128
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:30,180
they must be someone quite powerful.

1129
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:33,020
You want to leave?

1130
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,020
This is your last chance to leave, or are we going to open this door?

1131
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:45,159
This is sus as fuck.

1132
01:55:45,159 --> 01:55:47,550
Alright, open it.

1133
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,789
You push open the door and stride inside.

1134
01:55:50,789 --> 01:55:53,119
Inside the house.

1135
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:57,340
The hut is neatly laid out.

1136
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:00,579
You detect the touch of a fastidious woman.

1137
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:04,010
Chairs are set around a table as if for guests.

1138
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:09,189
A mattress lies in one corner, and a large kitchen area indicates that whoever lives here,

1139
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:10,489
they are fond of cooking.

1140
01:56:10,489 --> 01:56:12,119
Take what I can.

1141
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:13,359
Or call out.

1142
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:16,039
Just like, grab, grab.

1143
01:56:16,039 --> 01:56:17,039
Why would you steal?

1144
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:19,039
You can't just steal everything.

1145
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:27,449
We have stolen from every single person we've come across so far.

1146
01:56:27,449 --> 01:56:28,449
We'll call out.

1147
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:29,449
We have to, right?

1148
01:56:29,449 --> 01:56:30,449
We can't just take everything.

1149
01:56:30,449 --> 01:56:33,600
Hello?

1150
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,600
Is there anybody here?

1151
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:37,409
To your surprise, a voice answers quickly.

1152
01:56:37,409 --> 01:56:38,720
Who's there?

1153
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:39,720
Who is that?

1154
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:42,359
Ignore it.

1155
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:43,359
Locate the speaker.

1156
01:56:43,359 --> 01:56:45,359
I warn you, I am armed.

1157
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:52,569
I broke into your house, and I have a weapon.

1158
01:56:52,569 --> 01:56:53,569
Why would I do that?

1159
01:56:53,569 --> 01:56:58,239
Locate the speaker, or ignore it.

1160
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,239
Locate the speaker.

1161
01:56:59,239 --> 01:57:03,060
Looking into a corner, hidden by a large cupboard,

1162
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:06,430
you see a cage in which a young woman is imprisoned.

1163
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:07,920
Good stranger!

1164
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,159
Let me out of this cage, I beg you!

1165
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,170
Get her out.

1166
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:13,409
What happened to you?

1167
01:57:13,409 --> 01:57:15,720
I'm sure you were there for a reason.

1168
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:22,649
What happened?

1169
01:57:22,649 --> 01:57:25,279
You move over to the cage, quite shocked.

1170
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:26,710
What happened to you?

1171
01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:29,140
Oh, good stranger.

1172
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:31,140
I've been locked up here for two days.

1173
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,140
It was Elvins that did it.

1174
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:35,140
Those mischievous, prankful Elvins.

1175
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,140
Please, you must help me.

1176
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:38,319
I have not eaten, and they left me here,

1177
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,319
where I can see all my cooking things, but cannot reach them.

1178
01:57:41,319 --> 01:57:45,439
I'll help you.

1179
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:47,739
If I let you go, what do I get in return?

1180
01:57:47,739 --> 01:57:56,789
I'll help you.

1181
01:57:56,789 --> 01:57:59,670
Going over to the cage, you try for the door.

1182
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:00,670
It's locked, of course.

1183
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:04,229
Use magic, try an item, or break the lock.

1184
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:06,810
You can use dop, right?

1185
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:11,319
Use magic.

1186
01:58:11,319 --> 01:58:14,899
You should be grateful I waste my strength on you.

1187
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:17,899
You declare as you roll up your sleeves.

1188
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:24,840
Oh, no.

1189
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:28,149
No, I can't.

1190
01:58:28,149 --> 01:58:30,989
I can't.

1191
01:58:30,989 --> 01:58:32,989
What is pep?

1192
01:58:32,989 --> 01:58:34,289
Cause strength?

1193
01:58:34,289 --> 01:58:39,090
What a dick.

1194
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:42,100
Raz sharpen my blade?

1195
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,810
Should I just do it?

1196
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:45,810
But what if I kill her?

1197
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:47,810
I don't want to kill this person.

1198
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:51,819
Dop is, it's dop.

1199
01:58:51,819 --> 01:58:54,819
Dop is, wait, cause slowness?

1200
01:58:54,819 --> 01:58:55,819
What would I do?

1201
01:58:55,819 --> 01:58:56,819
I'm doing this.

1202
01:58:56,819 --> 01:59:00,810
You begin the spell.

1203
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:05,810
Aliana watches you and must have some understanding of magic as she calls out to you.

1204
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:07,550
Wait.

1205
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:08,550
What are you?

1206
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:09,550
But it's too late.

1207
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:18,800
The spell has taken effect and Aliana has passed out on the floor of her cage.

1208
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:25,949
Should I rewind?

1209
01:59:25,949 --> 01:59:26,949
Can I?

1210
01:59:26,949 --> 01:59:27,949
No rewinds?

1211
01:59:27,949 --> 01:59:29,960
Hold on.

1212
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,960
Let me see what's in here.

1213
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,199
Perfect.

1214
01:59:32,199 --> 01:59:34,500
Now you can search this place in peace.

1215
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,000
You begin to carefully search the drawers and cupboards of the hut.

1216
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It's very empty.

1217
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Perhaps whoever locked the woman up robbed her themselves.

1218
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,760
All you find is two gold pieces and a pouch containing soft brown sand.

1219
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,699
You need to rewind.

1220
01:59:50,699 --> 01:59:51,699
I thought you didn't want to steal.

1221
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:52,699
What's the sand?

1222
01:59:52,699 --> 01:59:56,479
Can I just see what the sand is?

1223
01:59:56,479 --> 01:59:58,159
Take everything.

1224
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:59,159
You pocket both and turn to go.

1225
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:03,529
The woman snores quietly away as you slip out of the hut.

1226
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:05,529
You retrace your steps to the last junction.

1227
02:00:05,529 --> 02:00:07,090
Wait, hold on.

1228
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:08,590
Whoa!

1229
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:12,130
The vixen?

1230
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:13,130
This is my new god.

1231
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:18,199
The vixen is a creature of high cunning and low morals.

1232
02:00:18,199 --> 02:00:25,760
She will lie, cheat, swindle, and sidle her way out of trouble and into riches, always

1233
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:31,909
taking care to cover her trail.

1234
02:00:31,909 --> 02:00:34,340
I've never seen that before.

1235
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:35,340
You need to rewind, you monster.

1236
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:40,229
All right.

1237
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:45,090
This is an important thing for us to decide if we continue to do this.

1238
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:51,199
I would like you all to vote besides death.

1239
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:55,369
Okay, because there are hundreds of ways to die in this game at any moment.

1240
02:00:55,369 --> 02:00:58,800
Besides dying, am I allowed to rewind?

1241
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,390
Let's get an actual opinion here.

1242
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:05,390
Please, if you are lurking right now, this is a very important thing.

1243
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:11,380
Remember, if I die, I can rewind to before I died.

1244
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:16,600
But in a sense where, oh, I just did something.

1245
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,100
Oh, that's bad.

1246
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,100
Am I allowed to go back?

1247
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,239
This is very, very important.

1248
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:25,460
This is going to dictate a lot.

1249
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:27,460
Because do I have to live with my decisions?

1250
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,460
Do I have to sleep in the bed that I make?

1251
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:35,920
What do you think?

1252
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,920
I know this is going to be close.

1253
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:42,239
Action should have consequences.

1254
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:52,850
Or maybe I can only rewind once or maybe like a few times a game.

1255
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:56,079
Maybe, right?

1256
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:57,079
Oh, this winning.

1257
02:01:57,079 --> 02:01:58,079
Wow, I'm surprised.

1258
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:00,659
I'm really surprised.

1259
02:02:00,659 --> 02:02:02,659
I thought that that was not going to win.

1260
02:02:02,659 --> 02:02:03,659
Okay.

1261
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:06,500
All right.

1262
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,960
That's pretty close though.

1263
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,279
Just don't abuse it.

1264
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:12,279
You get three rewinds.

1265
02:02:12,279 --> 02:02:14,279
Rewind, rewind, rewind tokens.

1266
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:15,970
Okay.

1267
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:23,720
All right.

1268
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,720
I can have three rewinds total per part, per game, per episode.

1269
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:33,909
We already did a no rewind.

1270
02:02:33,909 --> 02:02:34,909
I can't even say that word.

1271
02:02:34,909 --> 02:02:39,220
Okay.

1272
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:43,460
So I, so, but I get to decide when I use those rewinds, right?

1273
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:44,460
Three times per game.

1274
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:51,380
Okay.

1275
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:52,380
I'm not using it here.

1276
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:55,479
I'm not using it here.

1277
02:02:55,479 --> 02:02:58,550
I don't need, I don't have to go back.

1278
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:59,550
I got a bunch of sand.

1279
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:01,560
I'm not using it here.

1280
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:12,880
Omega Lo, what the fuck?

1281
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,149
We should get one.

1282
02:03:15,149 --> 02:03:18,149
Wait, just because I can rewind doesn't mean I have to.

1283
02:03:18,149 --> 02:03:25,010
I don't want to, what if I need, what if it's a really important thing that happens?

1284
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,010
Terrible morals?

1285
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:29,109
What do you guys think?

1286
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:31,109
Three times per, oh yeah, I think that's fair.

1287
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:37,439
You should zap yourself.

1288
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:45,529
Yeah.

1289
02:03:45,529 --> 02:03:46,529
Hey, let me tell you something.

1290
02:03:46,529 --> 02:03:48,840
I get to choose when these happen.

1291
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,399
Okay.

1292
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:59,149
Something that you should, hey, all of you that are watching right now, there's so many

1293
02:03:59,149 --> 02:04:00,149
things to experience.

1294
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:01,840
Go get it.

1295
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,329
Go get it.

1296
02:04:03,329 --> 02:04:04,329
It's fucking awesome.

1297
02:04:04,329 --> 02:04:07,529
And you've got opportunities.

1298
02:04:07,529 --> 02:04:08,529
You're a vixen.

1299
02:04:08,529 --> 02:04:10,350
Yeah.

1300
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:11,350
I'm not using it here.

1301
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:14,350
This is not, to me, I made out from that exchange.

1302
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:17,510
Do you understand?

1303
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:31,359
I got a bunch of sand, which that's fucking pretty sick if you ask me.

1304
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:34,350
That's so worthless.

1305
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:36,350
You're a piece of shit.

1306
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:37,590
Why?

1307
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:43,590
I casted like the go to sleep spell and I stole everything in this person's house.

1308
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:46,920
No, I am sleeping in that bed.

1309
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,920
I want to keep the sand.

1310
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,479
Wait, let me, wait, let me determine.

1311
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:54,380
Can I, is sand actually for a spell?

1312
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:56,380
Because if it is, I want to know what it is.

1313
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:59,800
Mud?

1314
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,800
Ooh.

1315
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:07,800
While casting, the caster must sprinkle grains of sand onto the floor to create a pool of

1316
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:08,800
quicksand.

1317
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,550
Any creature stepping into the quicksand will slowly be sucked away.

1318
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:16,350
You shitting me?

1319
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:17,350
I've got quicksand now.

1320
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:18,350
I'm going to dump us.

1321
02:05:18,350 --> 02:05:24,770
Aliana died for this.

1322
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:34,369
Aliana didn't die, okay?

1323
02:05:34,369 --> 02:05:40,699
Look, I'm playing a chaotic, lawful good.

1324
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:47,500
You walk for several hours following the twists and turns of the path through the trees.

1325
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,500
Then suddenly you stop.

1326
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,800
You've heard a noise up ahead.

1327
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,920
Something is moving around between the rocks at the edge of the path.

1328
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:55,920
Vixen.

1329
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,210
I draw my sword.

1330
02:05:59,210 --> 02:06:04,649
You draw your sword and ready and you're glad you did because a moment later you're

1331
02:06:05,649 --> 02:06:06,649
attacked.

1332
02:06:06,649 --> 02:06:10,649
In a flurry of foliage and dirt, a rat bear leaps from underground.

1333
02:06:10,649 --> 02:06:12,649
It's much closer than you thought.

1334
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:17,149
Its sleek black fur allows it to hide in the shadows until it's almost upon you.

1335
02:06:17,149 --> 02:06:18,149
You bring your sword.

1336
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:23,800
I'm glad I did that.

1337
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:24,800
Holy shit.

1338
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,800
Okay, this is bad.

1339
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,800
Look at this fucking bar.

1340
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:32,439
I'm going to defend.

1341
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:35,250
Good thing I did.

1342
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:39,619
The rat bear is startled by your approach but drops quickly to all fours.

1343
02:06:39,619 --> 02:06:43,859
You drop quickly behind a tree and raise your sword, ready to defend yourself.

1344
02:06:43,859 --> 02:06:48,859
At the last moment, the rat bear leaps, all claws off the ground and gnarling and lunging

1345
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:49,859
at you.

1346
02:06:49,859 --> 02:06:51,859
You brace yourself as it comes down.

1347
02:06:51,859 --> 02:06:54,739
It rears back, claws raised.

1348
02:06:54,739 --> 02:06:55,739
All right, we're going to go four.

1349
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:57,039
No, six.

1350
02:06:57,039 --> 02:06:59,369
Fuck.

1351
02:06:59,369 --> 02:07:02,149
Okay.

1352
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:03,770
You risk an attack.

1353
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:07,770
Rushing forward, you charge at the rat bear but it has read your intention and drops into

1354
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:09,010
a crouch.

1355
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:10,010
It grunts as it pushes you away.

1356
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:13,250
Afraid of you, it stumbles back, tail whipped high in defense.

1357
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:17,520
All right, you're going to go for probably another defense, right?

1358
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,520
Let's do two.

1359
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:19,819
Yep, that's good.

1360
02:07:19,819 --> 02:07:20,819
That's fine.

1361
02:07:20,819 --> 02:07:26,079
Side stepping, you slash out at the rat bear but it knocks you aside with a paw.

1362
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:28,390
You scratch the creature's hide.

1363
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:30,390
It squeaks and snuffles, standing up on its hind legs.

1364
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:31,390
It's coming in for a hard one.

1365
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:33,270
Do I have enough though?

1366
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,789
Kill him.

1367
02:07:35,789 --> 02:07:37,789
Don't root for the rat bear.

1368
02:07:37,789 --> 02:07:39,409
Why?

1369
02:07:39,409 --> 02:07:41,409
Because I took a bunch of sand from some lady's house?

1370
02:07:41,409 --> 02:07:46,659
Holy shit, that would have fucking killed me.

1371
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:47,840
All right.

1372
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,720
You can almost smell the creature growing enraged and duck quickly behind a tree.

1373
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:56,960
Squeaking with rage, the rat bear charges forward but you keep yourself guarded.

1374
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,130
It edges back, claws raised.

1375
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:02,140
All right, it just used its whole bar.

1376
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:06,039
I'm going to go with like four.

1377
02:08:06,039 --> 02:08:07,039
No, like three.

1378
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:08,670
All right, that's fine.

1379
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:14,979
Swing a mighty blow at the rat bear but it has guessed your move.

1380
02:08:14,979 --> 02:08:18,239
High defense again.

1381
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:19,239
All right, let's go two.

1382
02:08:19,239 --> 02:08:22,210
Okay, that's fine.

1383
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:23,210
I'm slowly chipping away.

1384
02:08:23,210 --> 02:08:29,039
Fainting left, you slice at the rat bear but it bats you back into the mud with its tail.

1385
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:31,279
It's weakening little by little.

1386
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:33,279
It drops to all fours and lowers its head.

1387
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:34,279
All right, I think it's coming in hard.

1388
02:08:34,279 --> 02:08:37,199
Ooh, good.

1389
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:42,210
Splashing through the mud, you race into the rat bear, catching it at light blow.

1390
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:48,279
Light plays through the trees and for a moment, the true extent of the rat bear's injuries are revealed.

1391
02:08:48,279 --> 02:08:52,000
I'm going to defend.

1392
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Oh my goodness.

1393
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Okay, we're good.

1394
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,500
The creature's getting angry and probably desperate, right?

1395
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:03,119
Launches its front claws aimed at your eyes but you knock away its attack.

1396
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:06,300
For a moment, it's close enough for you to smell its sewer breath.

1397
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:08,859
It stumbles back, claws raised.

1398
02:09:08,859 --> 02:09:10,479
Go in.

1399
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:11,479
All right, fuck, whatever.

1400
02:09:11,479 --> 02:09:15,479
Fuck.

1401
02:09:15,479 --> 02:09:17,479
Okay, it's going to come in at a full bar here.

1402
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:20,479
It growls and grunts, rearing up, showing its full height.

1403
02:09:20,479 --> 02:09:21,720
Defend.

1404
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:25,170
I'm losing too much health for this.

1405
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:26,729
All right, I got to go full blast.

1406
02:09:26,729 --> 02:09:29,060
We're good.

1407
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:30,489
Get out of here.

1408
02:09:30,489 --> 02:09:33,199
I win.

1409
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:34,199
You risk an attack.

1410
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:35,199
You charge into the rat bear.

1411
02:09:35,199 --> 02:09:39,199
Then your sword slips between the creature's ribs and drives deep into its putrid heart.

1412
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:46,949
The rat bear squeals and falls to the ground, face down in the mud.

1413
02:09:46,949 --> 02:09:50,810
Competent combat.

1414
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:57,439
With the bees dead on the path, you are free to move onwards.

1415
02:09:57,439 --> 02:10:02,460
Approaching?

1416
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:06,199
Dump us.

1417
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:11,609
The path winds a few more times around gigantic trees, thousands of years old, and then emerges

1418
02:10:11,609 --> 02:10:17,409
onto a sudden plain, as if the forest had been scooped away by a gigantic hand.

1419
02:10:17,409 --> 02:10:27,600
A river trickles, thinly, between short grasses and by its bank stands a tiny village.

1420
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:30,600
We don't even need to run a pole going into Dumpus.

1421
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,600
It's going to be like 95%.

1422
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:36,340
We don't even need to run that pole.

1423
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:43,210
Today has been a short day with few true dangers.

1424
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:47,210
With a decent meal and a night's sleep, your next day will start auspiciously.

1425
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:49,520
So you begin the gentle climb down into the village.

1426
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:55,489
You follow the path down into the village, passing a sign, which declares it to be Dumpus.

1427
02:10:55,489 --> 02:10:59,489
The streets are thin and narrow, and the buildings have been set close together, as if trying

1428
02:10:59,489 --> 02:11:00,489
to withstand a storm.

1429
02:11:00,489 --> 02:11:02,920
There's a terrible smell hanging in the air.

1430
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:06,159
All in all, it seems an unpleasant place.

1431
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:18,670
Find an inn, talk to villagers, or explore the town.

1432
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:19,670
Big F? Yeah.

1433
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:26,260
Why did you leave that person in the cage?

1434
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:31,529
I don't know.

1435
02:11:31,529 --> 02:11:33,529
I stole stuff.

1436
02:11:33,529 --> 02:11:36,689
I don't know.

1437
02:11:36,689 --> 02:11:40,789
Because I just did.

1438
02:11:40,789 --> 02:11:41,789
Because I'm evil.

1439
02:11:41,789 --> 02:11:43,789
No, I just wanted to click it and see what happened.

1440
02:11:43,789 --> 02:11:46,479
And then I didn't want to waste a rewind on it.

1441
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:47,479
You killed her.

1442
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:48,479
I didn't kill anybody.

1443
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:51,000
I didn't kill anybody.

1444
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Uh, I want to...

1445
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Hmm.

1446
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
She's going to starve in there.

1447
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
She's going to be fine.

1448
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I don't...

1449
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,899
Go steal more sand.

1450
02:12:03,899 --> 02:12:06,460
Go steal more sand.

1451
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:13,550
I'm talking to villagers.

1452
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:14,550
Sand is...

1453
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:15,550
But I have sand now.

1454
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:18,939
Who is going to save her?

1455
02:12:18,939 --> 02:12:20,310
I don't know.

1456
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:23,399
She can't get out.

1457
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:25,710
But you don't know that.

1458
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,710
How do you know that?

1459
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:30,479
Alright, you pass along the main path through the village.

1460
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:35,979
And pause outside a hut in which several of the disheveled hill dwellers are sitting and eating.

1461
02:12:35,979 --> 02:12:38,279
They seem deep in discussion about something.

1462
02:12:38,279 --> 02:12:40,279
Several are shaking their fists in the air.

1463
02:12:40,279 --> 02:12:42,909
Lifting back the canvas flap, you step inside.

1464
02:12:42,909 --> 02:12:46,079
The hill dwellers stop talking immediately and look up at you.

1465
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:48,520
One gets to his feet and gestures you forward.

1466
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:57,409
Step over and bow my head.

1467
02:12:57,409 --> 02:13:17,800
You murdered a poor, innocent, caged woman for a cup of literal sand.

1468
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,619
I'm going to bow.

1469
02:13:19,619 --> 02:13:21,619
You nod your head once to the man who returns the gesture.

1470
02:13:21,619 --> 02:13:25,050
Then one of the others calls something in their native tongue.

1471
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:29,050
And points at your side to where your sword hangs out below the hem of your cloak.

1472
02:13:29,050 --> 02:13:32,550
In broken common tongue, the first man croaks.

1473
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:34,979
No weapons!

1474
02:13:34,979 --> 02:13:37,350
And he indicates a table by the door where you can leave the blade.

1475
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:45,539
Remove the sword, look over the table.

1476
02:13:45,539 --> 02:13:48,539
Enter with my sword, shake my head, and leave.

1477
02:13:48,539 --> 02:13:53,529
Oh, we got the ape back.

1478
02:13:53,529 --> 02:13:57,270
Look at the table.

1479
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:00,960
There are plenty of other weapons there, so they appear to be honest enough.

1480
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:06,229
Remove my sword?

1481
02:14:06,229 --> 02:14:18,239
You unfasten your sword belt and leave your weapon on the table.

1482
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:22,239
The hill dwellers nod to show their appreciation, and then beckon you to sit with them.

1483
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:27,439
Then they continue their conversation just as animately as before,

1484
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:29,609
speaking in a local tongue that you cannot follow.

1485
02:14:29,609 --> 02:14:32,920
But as they talk, they pour you a drink and provide you with food.

1486
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,920
They seem quite welcoming.

1487
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:40,119
Let's listen.

1488
02:14:40,119 --> 02:14:44,130
As you eat, you listen, catching a few words here and there.

1489
02:14:44,130 --> 02:14:47,130
Goblins! Arms! Christa Tonti!

1490
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:49,130
They seem to be very concerned.

1491
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:53,909
Tell them you've been there, ask about the goblins, or keep listening.

1492
02:14:53,909 --> 02:14:57,319
Keep listening.

1493
02:14:57,319 --> 02:14:59,010
Your interest peaked.

1494
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:00,010
You keep listening.

1495
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:02,699
Slowly, you piece together the story.

1496
02:15:02,699 --> 02:15:04,069
The group seem...

1497
02:15:04,069 --> 02:15:05,760
I just burped.

1498
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:10,760
The group seem quite sure that a horde of goblins are planning an attack on Christa Tonti,

1499
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:13,930
which is apparently one of the wealthier spots in the hills.

1500
02:15:13,930 --> 02:15:17,680
They're discussing whether or not it would be worth helping the village to defend itself,

1501
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,859
which might mean they are offered some kind of reward.

1502
02:15:20,859 --> 02:15:24,920
You must help them.

1503
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:25,920
Let them fend for themselves.

1504
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,920
Wait a while and decide later.

1505
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:30,369
More teeth.

1506
02:15:30,369 --> 02:15:33,920
You must help them.

1507
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:35,920
Let them fend for themselves.

1508
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,920
Wealthier, yeah.

1509
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:39,180
You must help them.

1510
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:42,789
You must help them, you declare earnestly.

1511
02:15:42,789 --> 02:15:48,529
Christa Tonti, it does not help us, one of the men points out.

1512
02:15:48,529 --> 02:15:49,710
They are rich.

1513
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:51,710
We are poor.

1514
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:56,789
You can be better than them.

1515
02:15:56,789 --> 02:15:58,789
You will place them in your debt.

1516
02:15:58,789 --> 02:16:02,840
You will place them in your debt?

1517
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:06,340
The men nod, swayed by your ruthless logic.

1518
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:07,840
And you?

1519
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:09,270
How do you fight?

1520
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:11,439
One man asks you.

1521
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:15,029
I serve the King of Analand.

1522
02:16:15,029 --> 02:16:16,029
I serve myself.

1523
02:16:16,029 --> 02:16:18,029
I will help those that need it.

1524
02:16:18,029 --> 02:16:25,359
I serve the King of Analand.

1525
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:31,359
No, I don't want people to know that.

1526
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:32,360
I serve myself.

1527
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:35,719
The men nod.

1528
02:16:35,719 --> 02:16:38,719
So you do not understand what we might lose.

1529
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:40,340
The evening draws to a close.

1530
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:43,340
The men thank you for your counsel and leave one by one.

1531
02:16:43,340 --> 02:17:07,260
All right, that's one.

1532
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:10,260
That's one, that's one, that's one, that's one, that's one, that's one, that's one.

1533
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:16,040
Okay, I'm going to bow my head, remove my sword.

1534
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:19,739
Listen to their talk.

1535
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:20,739
Keep listening.

1536
02:17:20,739 --> 02:17:23,200
You must help them.

1537
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,969
Place them in your debt.

1538
02:17:25,969 --> 02:17:28,040
Okay.

1539
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:30,040
I will help those that need it.

1540
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:33,010
Wait, what?

1541
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:35,010
I will help those that need it.

1542
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:36,010
The men nod.

1543
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:38,010
Let the goblins attack tonight, they cheer.

1544
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:40,010
We will use your strength.

1545
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:42,250
The evening draws to a close.

1546
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:47,180
The men thank you for your counsel and leave.

1547
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:48,180
I'm fucking out of here.

1548
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:49,180
I'm leaving.

1549
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,180
I'm out of here.

1550
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:51,180
I'm literally out of here.

1551
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,180
I'm out of here.

1552
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:55,440
I'm going to fucking leave right now.

1553
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,440
I can't rewind a second time.

1554
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:59,840
Should I leave?

1555
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:09,479
I think I'm going to leave.

1556
02:18:09,479 --> 02:18:10,479
I have to leave.

1557
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:12,620
Oh, okay.

1558
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:13,620
I'm going to...

1559
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:14,620
Fine, I'll stick around.

1560
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:15,620
I'm going to explore the town.

1561
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:18,969
Fine.

1562
02:18:18,969 --> 02:18:21,969
Halfway along the track, you come across a couple of merchants' huts.

1563
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:26,899
You browse for items worth buying with your nine gold pieces.

1564
02:18:26,899 --> 02:18:29,899
Your attention is taken by a finely woven skullcap,

1565
02:18:29,899 --> 02:18:35,319
a finely crafted sword, and a small bag of provisions.

1566
02:18:35,319 --> 02:18:37,129
Name the skullcap.

1567
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:40,010
You pick up the skullcap and turn it over.

1568
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:44,010
Stolen from a priest of Dadu-Lay, the merchant declares with pride,

1569
02:18:44,010 --> 02:18:46,010
a fine piece of work.

1570
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,010
Four gold pieces.

1571
02:18:47,010 --> 02:18:50,700
You can tell from the feel of the cloth that has no inherent magic,

1572
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:53,069
but it might be useful in spells.

1573
02:18:53,069 --> 02:18:56,930
Try it on.

1574
02:18:56,930 --> 02:18:58,940
I'm going to put it on.

1575
02:18:58,940 --> 02:19:01,950
You place it on your head, but you feel nothing.

1576
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:02,950
You take it off again.

1577
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:10,270
I'm on it.

1578
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:11,639
You pay him four gold pieces.

1579
02:19:11,639 --> 02:19:13,639
You place the skullcap in your sack.

1580
02:19:13,639 --> 02:19:14,639
That's enough.

1581
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:17,030
You nod to the merchant.

1582
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:19,030
Is there anything else I can help you with?

1583
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:24,659
Yeah, no, I think I can use that.

1584
02:19:24,659 --> 02:19:30,959
Hold on.

1585
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:33,030
Yep.

1586
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:36,030
Hell, to activate the spell, the caster must wear a cloth skullcap.

1587
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:39,200
The user may then read the mind of any intelligent creature nearby,

1588
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,200
learning its weaknesses, the contents of nearby rooms,

1589
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,200
and other such details.

1590
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:47,069
There we go.

1591
02:19:47,069 --> 02:19:48,069
That works.

1592
02:19:48,069 --> 02:19:55,899
I'm running out of money.

1593
02:19:55,899 --> 02:19:59,290
Is there any work to be had here?

1594
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:00,290
I need to earn some money.

1595
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:03,159
The merchant sizes you up.

1596
02:20:03,159 --> 02:20:05,969
You look like a good worker to me.

1597
02:20:05,969 --> 02:20:08,209
One of my friends needs some digging doing.

1598
02:20:08,209 --> 02:20:11,209
I'm sure he would pay you and feed you for it.

1599
02:20:11,209 --> 02:20:14,540
Digging what, you ask.

1600
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:16,909
The merchant shifts uncomfortably.

1601
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:17,909
Does it matter?

1602
02:20:17,909 --> 02:20:19,469
You'll find out.

1603
02:20:19,469 --> 02:20:20,469
He stares at you.

1604
02:20:20,469 --> 02:20:22,030
So?

1605
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:25,659
He looks over his shoulder at the path.

1606
02:20:25,659 --> 02:20:27,659
I'm going that way now myself.

1607
02:20:27,659 --> 02:20:28,659
You coming?

1608
02:20:28,659 --> 02:20:35,250
The goblins attack tonight.

1609
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:38,879
I'm going to go dig stuff for money.

1610
02:20:38,879 --> 02:20:39,879
I'm doing it.

1611
02:20:39,879 --> 02:20:47,219
Follow the merchant.

1612
02:20:47,219 --> 02:20:49,610
I'm doing it.

1613
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:52,239
He leads you to a house on the edge of the village

1614
02:20:52,239 --> 02:20:54,239
and introduces you to the householder,

1615
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:57,239
a stout man who is probably incapable of lifting a spade,

1616
02:20:57,239 --> 02:20:58,239
let alone digging with it.

1617
02:20:58,239 --> 02:20:59,239
I'm ready to get started.

1618
02:20:59,239 --> 02:21:02,879
What is it you need doing?

1619
02:21:02,879 --> 02:21:06,559
Suspit.

1620
02:21:06,559 --> 02:21:07,559
Outback.

1621
02:21:07,559 --> 02:21:09,860
Needs digging.

1622
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:12,059
How much?

1623
02:21:12,059 --> 02:21:14,620
Well, it's pretty urgent.

1624
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:15,620
It's pretty urgent.

1625
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:17,799
The old one's overflowing.

1626
02:21:17,799 --> 02:21:20,290
How much money?

1627
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:21,979
Three gold pieces.

1628
02:21:21,979 --> 02:21:24,690
That's it?

1629
02:21:24,690 --> 02:21:28,559
I don't remember doing this.

1630
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:30,559
Did I do this in the other playthrough?

1631
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:32,500
You can keep your money.

1632
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:34,500
No, I'll get started.

1633
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,959
Spade's outback.

1634
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:39,200
He replies with a jerk of his thumb.

1635
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,629
You walk through the man's house into the back garden.

1636
02:21:42,629 --> 02:21:43,799
The smell is terrible.

1637
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:46,979
The job is not just to dig a new suspit,

1638
02:21:46,979 --> 02:21:48,979
but to dig over the old one.

1639
02:21:48,979 --> 02:21:51,219
And it's going to be several hours work

1640
02:21:51,219 --> 02:21:52,219
that'll probably take the whole night.

1641
02:21:52,219 --> 02:21:55,840
You collect the spade stuck in the ground by the hole.

1642
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:07,520
Pause strength.

1643
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:13,209
Nothing with a D.

1644
02:22:13,209 --> 02:22:15,090
Oh, I can do big.

1645
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:17,090
Grow in size.

1646
02:22:17,090 --> 02:22:19,590
Do toilet magic.

1647
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:20,590
Z.

1648
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:22,590
Z.

1649
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:24,889
All right, I'm doing it.

1650
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:29,090
You cast a spell and point your finger at the hole in the ground.

1651
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:32,090
With a flash, a burst of lightning flies from your hand

1652
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:33,090
and hits the ground.

1653
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:35,090
Earth explodes upwards.

1654
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:38,090
And when the air clears, you have created a fine hole,

1655
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:40,399
a little rough around the edges, perhaps,

1656
02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:42,399
but you still saved yourself plenty of work.

1657
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:45,659
I did the same thing.

1658
02:22:45,659 --> 02:22:48,600
I did the same thing.

1659
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:52,319
Recycled zap.

1660
02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:53,319
I did the same thing.

1661
02:22:53,319 --> 02:22:56,959
You go back into the house and collect.

1662
02:22:56,959 --> 02:22:57,959
I did.

1663
02:22:57,959 --> 02:22:59,840
I did.

1664
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:03,879
Shit, I did the same thing.

1665
02:23:03,879 --> 02:23:05,879
This is literally a rerun.

1666
02:23:05,879 --> 02:23:06,879
Fuck, really?

1667
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:10,360
Shit.

1668
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:11,360
It's all right.

1669
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,360
It's fine.

1670
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:13,360
It's classic.

1671
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:15,979
You go back into the house and collect your money.

1672
02:23:15,979 --> 02:23:16,979
Three gold pieces.

1673
02:23:16,979 --> 02:23:19,979
The grateful householder also provides you with some food,

1674
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:22,219
as well as a spare, as well as a space on the floor

1675
02:23:22,219 --> 02:23:24,219
to rest for the remainder of the night.

1676
02:23:24,219 --> 02:23:27,219
You settle down and fall asleep quickly.

1677
02:23:27,219 --> 02:23:33,020
You dream strange dreams as you sleep.

1678
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:36,200
Your thoughts are dominated by the strange woman in the hut.

1679
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:39,760
In your mind, she has become younger and more beautiful

1680
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:41,760
than she truly was.

1681
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,120
Flowers seem to blossom from her hair,

1682
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:47,299
as though she was grown from the earth itself.

1683
02:23:47,299 --> 02:23:50,989
Overhead you fancy you hear the flap of giant wings.

1684
02:23:50,989 --> 02:23:54,610
The birdmen came for the crown, perhaps.

1685
02:23:54,610 --> 02:23:56,850
Before this journey is finished,

1686
02:23:56,850 --> 02:24:07,879
it will come for you, leaving Dumpest.

1687
02:24:07,879 --> 02:24:10,790
You did this.

1688
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:14,440
Guilt is now setting in.

1689
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:15,739
Yeah.

1690
02:24:15,739 --> 02:24:17,430
It's okay.

1691
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:20,430
You rise early, dismiss the attentions of the householder,

1692
02:24:20,430 --> 02:24:21,430
and head out onto the street.

1693
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:24,729
Within a few minutes of walking, you are out of Dumpest

1694
02:24:24,729 --> 02:24:26,100
and back on the road.

1695
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:28,100
After another hour or so, the way branches,

1696
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:30,100
with one path leading up into the hills

1697
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:31,100
and the other turning downhill

1698
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:33,100
and along one side of a barren, stony ridge.

1699
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:36,399
Is that a village you can make out on the top of the hill?

1700
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:37,639
Seems a lonely place for it.

1701
02:24:37,639 --> 02:24:41,190
Where are we going?

1702
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:45,090
Uphill to the town?

1703
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:49,090
Or go downhill around here to this big bridge?

1704
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:53,700
Uphill or downhill?

1705
02:24:53,700 --> 02:25:01,399
Back to Dumpest.

1706
02:25:01,399 --> 02:25:10,040
Oh, I forgot to say, pull!

1707
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:11,040
Sorry.

1708
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,840
Forgot about the goblins.

1709
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,840
They'll be all right.

1710
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:21,219
They'll be okay.

1711
02:25:21,219 --> 02:25:27,319
They'll be fine.

1712
02:25:27,319 --> 02:25:28,319
Turn back.

1713
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:34,790
Oh, this is close.

1714
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:36,790
Uphill or downhill?

1715
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:38,959
Dude, you're going to hell.

1716
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:49,870
You're going to abandon Dumpest like you did that old lady.

1717
02:25:49,870 --> 02:25:50,870
Or did the lady.

1718
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:59,879
You're a monster.

1719
02:25:59,879 --> 02:26:00,879
All right, where are we going?

1720
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:05,360
You bravely ran away.

1721
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:06,360
I think this is close.

1722
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:07,360
Where are we going?

1723
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:10,639
Come on.

1724
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:13,840
We're going up to Urestanti.

1725
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:22,270
The gentle upward slope becomes a steep climb

1726
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:24,270
and you're forced to rest several times.

1727
02:26:24,270 --> 02:26:27,889
So far, you've been walking through the foothills.

1728
02:26:27,889 --> 02:26:29,889
Now the journey will become more serious.

1729
02:26:29,889 --> 02:26:32,840
When finally you reach the summit

1730
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:35,840
and can look out over the low plateau you've crested,

1731
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:37,840
you see the path runs through a small settlement

1732
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:39,840
of crudely fashioned huts.

1733
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:48,069
There are villagers out in the street talking and working.

1734
02:26:48,069 --> 02:26:49,069
It seems a happy bustling place,

1735
02:26:49,069 --> 02:26:51,069
despite the filth in the streets

1736
02:26:51,069 --> 02:26:52,069
and the barren surroundings.

1737
02:26:52,069 --> 02:26:54,370
Why do I have a memory of this place?

1738
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:56,549
I like remember this person's face.

1739
02:26:56,549 --> 02:27:01,670
I remember this person's face.

1740
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:07,770
I don't know why.

1741
02:27:07,770 --> 02:27:10,200
Another filthy city.

1742
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,200
Yeah, every city is like filthy.

1743
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:17,280
You see the filth and the stench in the air.

1744
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:19,729
I'm going to wait.

1745
02:27:19,729 --> 02:27:20,729
You stay at your vantage point

1746
02:27:20,729 --> 02:27:22,729
and watch a while longer to see if things change.

1747
02:27:22,729 --> 02:27:24,729
After a while, you begin to notice something strange

1748
02:27:24,729 --> 02:27:26,729
about the way the people in the village are moving.

1749
02:27:26,729 --> 02:27:28,969
First, you notice one is limping.

1750
02:27:28,969 --> 02:27:29,969
Then another.

1751
02:27:29,969 --> 02:27:32,969
Then you realize they are all shuffling as they move.

1752
02:27:32,969 --> 02:27:33,969
Some use sticks.

1753
02:27:33,969 --> 02:27:35,969
One is even crawling.

1754
02:27:35,969 --> 02:27:38,750
I don't think I want to go here.

1755
02:27:38,750 --> 02:27:42,399
I don't think I want to be here.

1756
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:45,750
Watch more.

1757
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:47,750
You stay hidden and watch for longer.

1758
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:49,750
After a while, you realize that whatever is happening

1759
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:50,750
in the village, it is desperate.

1760
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:53,049
There's no laughter, no joy.

1761
02:27:53,049 --> 02:27:55,610
There's no trade or commerce.

1762
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:59,040
The women do not walk about and the men do not watch them.

1763
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,350
It is like a prison camp.

1764
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:04,799
I don't think I go here.

1765
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,479
Go in.

1766
02:28:09,479 --> 02:28:12,229
I remember this place.

1767
02:28:12,229 --> 02:28:14,229
I forget exactly what happens in here,

1768
02:28:14,229 --> 02:28:15,229
but I know it's not good.

1769
02:28:15,229 --> 02:28:20,670
You must atone for all your other sins.

1770
02:28:20,670 --> 02:28:25,940
All right, what are we doing?

1771
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,120
Let's do a poll.

1772
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:29,120
Am I going in or am I going to try to help?

1773
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,120
Maybe I can do it right this time.

1774
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:32,120
I feel like something really bad happened.

1775
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:38,620
If my memory is correct, I feel like something bad happens.

1776
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:40,819
I don't remember.

1777
02:28:40,819 --> 02:28:46,120
Go in and help or stay away.

1778
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:54,010
You have two rewinds.

1779
02:28:54,010 --> 02:28:55,010
Don't be afraid.

1780
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:56,010
That's true.

1781
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:59,399
That is true.

1782
02:28:59,399 --> 02:29:07,020
Seems pretty unanimous so far.

1783
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:09,020
Yeah, seems pretty unanimous.

1784
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:13,500
I can't believe I zapped the hole last time too,

1785
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,500
and I did the same thing.

1786
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:21,799
All right, I'll go in.

1787
02:29:21,799 --> 02:29:23,799
I'll go in, but it's going to be bad,

1788
02:29:23,799 --> 02:29:24,799
and I'm going to have to rewind.

1789
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:26,799
I'm going to go and visit these people.

1790
02:29:26,799 --> 02:29:30,440
These are people in need of a savior.

1791
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,620
You may not be that man, but you can try.

1792
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:36,989
You approach arms open to show you are not a threat,

1793
02:29:36,989 --> 02:29:39,549
but the message is not understood.

1794
02:29:39,549 --> 02:29:43,360
The villagers see you and panic.

1795
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:45,600
They begin to scurry inside their huts

1796
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,600
as if you were an army and not a lone traveler.

1797
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:50,290
Their bodies are thin and malnourished,

1798
02:29:50,290 --> 02:29:52,469
and as they disappear through their doors,

1799
02:29:52,469 --> 02:29:54,469
you notice some are missing limbs.

1800
02:29:54,469 --> 02:29:58,649
Walk straight through the village.

1801
02:29:58,649 --> 02:30:02,709
Stop at a door and knock.

1802
02:30:02,709 --> 02:30:04,709
Am I going to get attacked?

1803
02:30:04,709 --> 02:30:17,809
I don't remember what happens.

1804
02:30:17,809 --> 02:30:19,809
Break through, Omega Lul.

1805
02:30:19,809 --> 02:30:20,809
I can't.

1806
02:30:20,809 --> 02:30:22,049
I'll knock.

1807
02:30:22,049 --> 02:30:24,049
You knock on the door of one of the nearest huts.

1808
02:30:24,049 --> 02:30:25,049
There is no reply.

1809
02:30:25,049 --> 02:30:27,569
Enter the hut.

1810
02:30:27,569 --> 02:30:30,000
I don't remember this.

1811
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Enter the hut?

1812
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,950
Another hut?

1813
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:35,379
Or leave the village?

1814
02:30:35,379 --> 02:30:38,989
What do I do?

1815
02:30:38,989 --> 02:30:39,989
This is up to you guys,

1816
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:46,200
because I actually don't fucking remember.

1817
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:47,200
Yeah.

1818
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,909
Leave, enter this one, or another hut.

1819
02:30:52,909 --> 02:30:53,909
I'm going to leave this up to you.

1820
02:30:53,909 --> 02:31:00,739
Why would I just go in?

1821
02:31:00,739 --> 02:31:02,739
Dude, we could steal some more sand.

1822
02:31:02,739 --> 02:31:03,739
Oh yeah, dude.

1823
02:31:03,739 --> 02:31:04,739
That would be sick.

1824
02:31:04,739 --> 02:31:15,299
Okay, let's see what you guys want to do.

1825
02:31:15,299 --> 02:31:16,299
Check another hut.

1826
02:31:16,299 --> 02:31:19,309
It's winning by a lot.

1827
02:31:19,309 --> 02:31:22,309
There are 10% of you are smart, right?

1828
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:25,930
This is probably bad, what's going to happen here.

1829
02:31:25,930 --> 02:31:31,239
There's no way you're going to leave.

1830
02:31:31,239 --> 02:31:33,549
You're not going to steal from these people, are you?

1831
02:31:33,549 --> 02:31:39,309
No, you're going to scare them.

1832
02:31:39,309 --> 02:31:45,079
That part of chat is boring.

1833
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:49,159
90% of us, dude, are dumb as rocks.

1834
02:31:49,159 --> 02:31:54,600
All right, we're going to go in the other hut.

1835
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:56,600
Check, okay, another hut.

1836
02:31:56,600 --> 02:32:00,180
You approach the next hut.

1837
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:03,850
From inside, you hear the murmur of voices, so you enter.

1838
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:08,350
The hovel is tiny and foul, with no furnishing of any kind.

1839
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:10,350
A small fire burns in the middle of the floor.

1840
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:14,780
And by the far wall, a family of three cowers from you.

1841
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:23,760
The woman lifts a shaking hand, as if to hold you back.

1842
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:32,270
Create a force field.

1843
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:34,270
What if she's going to cast a spell at me?

1844
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:37,920
What if she's casting a spell at me?

1845
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:38,920
Create a stench.

1846
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:44,889
Oh, I can't.

1847
02:32:44,889 --> 02:32:45,889
Gack?

1848
02:32:45,889 --> 02:32:53,000
Cause fear?

1849
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,360
Rock.

1850
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:56,360
Turn them to stone.

1851
02:32:56,360 --> 02:33:00,719
That's fucking awful.

1852
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:02,719
I don't have any materials.

1853
02:33:02,719 --> 02:33:05,920
I can't do anything.

1854
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:06,920
I could do force field.

1855
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:13,760
That's a lot of stamina.

1856
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,260
Wait.

1857
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:16,260
Dim.

1858
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:21,920
Cause stupidity.

1859
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:22,920
Doc?

1860
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:24,920
Heal disease.

1861
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:26,920
Holy shit, I can heal the disease.

1862
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:27,920
I can heal disease.

1863
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:28,920
I can heal them.

1864
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,280
I have a potion.

1865
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,280
Remember the potion I took in the very beginning of the game?

1866
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:33,280
Remember, I sniffed it.

1867
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:34,280
I smelled the potion.

1868
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:36,969
I could fucking heal them.

1869
02:33:36,969 --> 02:33:39,969
I don't think I've ever done this in like the three playthroughs I've ever done.

1870
02:33:39,969 --> 02:33:50,840
I don't think I've done this.

1871
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:55,469
I'm gonna heal them.

1872
02:33:55,469 --> 02:33:58,030
Heal disease.

1873
02:33:58,030 --> 02:34:01,829
Go.

1874
02:34:01,829 --> 02:34:06,829
You pour the blimberry juice out onto your palm and cast your spell across it.

1875
02:34:06,829 --> 02:34:09,829
Then you cast the liquid onto the terrified villagers.

1876
02:34:09,829 --> 02:34:13,069
At first, the potion seems to burn them.

1877
02:34:13,069 --> 02:34:19,610
But then you realize it is the peeling skin, boils and warts that are burning away.

1878
02:34:19,610 --> 02:34:22,610
The man is shivering as though he has been cold for days.

1879
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:26,489
And through chattering teeth, he declares, you have cured us.

1880
02:34:26,489 --> 02:34:28,920
We have suffered the plague.

1881
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,360
Plague?

1882
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:31,360
Goodbye.

1883
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:34,579
Plague?

1884
02:34:34,579 --> 02:34:37,889
So that's what affects this village.

1885
02:34:37,889 --> 02:34:38,889
The man nods.

1886
02:34:38,889 --> 02:34:41,260
We are no village in truth.

1887
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:45,059
A few of us were cast out of Virutanti.

1888
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:47,940
A few from Dampus.

1889
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:49,940
And a few from other places.

1890
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:53,309
They forced us here with flaming torches to live or die.

1891
02:34:53,309 --> 02:34:55,479
He looks at his wife, who is weeping.

1892
02:34:55,479 --> 02:34:58,110
Most do not live.

1893
02:34:58,110 --> 02:35:00,559
How many are here?

1894
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:04,889
Thirty, perhaps, the man replies.

1895
02:35:04,889 --> 02:35:07,260
We were a hundred once.

1896
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:08,260
Please.

1897
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:10,260
He steps forward, hands outstretched.

1898
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:11,440
You have saved us.

1899
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:13,440
You can save the others.

1900
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:18,389
I cannot.

1901
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:21,569
You can save them now.

1902
02:35:21,569 --> 02:35:22,569
Understand this.

1903
02:35:22,569 --> 02:35:23,569
You must leave.

1904
02:35:23,569 --> 02:35:28,860
I don't have enough blimberry potions.

1905
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:37,399
I can't.

1906
02:35:37,399 --> 02:35:38,399
I can't.

1907
02:35:38,399 --> 02:35:40,790
I cannot.

1908
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:43,690
You shake your head.

1909
02:35:43,690 --> 02:35:44,690
I cannot.

1910
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:48,110
As you show them the empty potion bottle, they understand.

1911
02:35:48,110 --> 02:35:53,850
So what should we do?

1912
02:35:53,850 --> 02:35:56,819
You need to leave.

1913
02:35:56,819 --> 02:35:57,819
You must leave immediately.

1914
02:35:57,819 --> 02:36:00,250
The woman is looking at her hands.

1915
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:02,250
Her skin is soft once more.

1916
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:05,069
And richly brown.

1917
02:36:05,069 --> 02:36:06,069
But we are well.

1918
02:36:06,069 --> 02:36:07,069
We are blessed.

1919
02:36:07,069 --> 02:36:11,139
The magic will wear off in a few hours.

1920
02:36:11,139 --> 02:36:16,899
You must leave before then or you will become ill once more.

1921
02:36:16,899 --> 02:36:17,899
They do not hesitate.

1922
02:36:17,899 --> 02:36:21,459
Taking nothing, they race back along the path towards Dampus.

1923
02:36:21,459 --> 02:36:23,700
You head quickly the other way.

1924
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:28,260
From across the plateau, you see the man pause and shout something at you.

1925
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:32,149
Beware the black lotus!

1926
02:36:32,149 --> 02:36:39,399
Then he's gone.

1927
02:36:39,399 --> 02:36:40,399
I can't save them all, guys.

1928
02:36:40,399 --> 02:36:41,399
I don't have enough potions.

1929
02:36:41,399 --> 02:36:45,590
I can't save them all.

1930
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:47,590
If I had more potions, maybe.

1931
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:55,719
Somebody just said, Ruh-roh.

1932
02:36:55,719 --> 02:36:56,719
Brach rotus.

1933
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:02,840
Like Scooby-Doo?

1934
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:03,840
Scooby-Doo.

1935
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:14,559
Ruh-roh?

1936
02:37:14,559 --> 02:37:22,879
Why would Scooby-Doo be here?

1937
02:37:22,879 --> 02:37:23,879
Ruh-raggy.

1938
02:37:23,879 --> 02:37:24,879
Ruh-roh.

1939
02:37:24,879 --> 02:37:26,879
Brach rotus raggy.

1940
02:37:26,879 --> 02:37:28,500
What the fuck?

1941
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:35,430
The path beyond the village heads downhill once more between thick trees.

1942
02:37:35,430 --> 02:37:38,860
Before turning into a narrow goat track that crosses a rough peak.

1943
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:41,420
From the summit, you get a wide view.

1944
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:46,629
Look around.

1945
02:37:46,629 --> 02:37:49,379
Head down a steep slope.

1946
02:37:49,379 --> 02:37:52,379
The next village is sprawled out before you.

1947
02:37:52,379 --> 02:37:56,809
And even from here, you can catch the sound of merry voices and shouting from the trees.

1948
02:37:56,809 --> 02:37:57,809
The streets.

1949
02:37:57,809 --> 02:37:58,809
It didn't say trees.

1950
02:37:58,809 --> 02:38:04,649
You remember, they're in the way to the goblin attacked village.

1951
02:38:04,649 --> 02:38:05,649
You haven't saved anybody.

1952
02:38:05,649 --> 02:38:09,899
Oh, no.

1953
02:38:09,899 --> 02:38:11,899
I sent them to their deaths.

1954
02:38:11,899 --> 02:38:12,899
That's right.

1955
02:38:12,899 --> 02:38:14,200
Oh, my God.

1956
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,200
You're right.

1957
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,079
That's horrible.

1958
02:38:17,079 --> 02:38:19,090
Oh, oops.

1959
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:20,090
What's new, Scooby-Doo?

1960
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:21,090
Coming after you.

1961
02:38:21,090 --> 02:38:22,090
Gonna fight.

1962
02:38:22,090 --> 02:38:23,090
Hold on.

1963
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:24,090
Gonna fight.

1964
02:38:24,090 --> 02:38:25,090
No, I can't do it.

1965
02:38:25,090 --> 02:38:26,090
I can't.

1966
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:27,090
I'm not good enough.

1967
02:38:27,090 --> 02:38:29,290
Head down a steep slope.

1968
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:31,290
The next village is sprawled out before you.

1969
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:35,659
And even from here, you can catch the sound of merry voices and shouting from the streets.

1970
02:38:35,659 --> 02:38:37,659
It must be a carnival.

1971
02:38:37,659 --> 02:38:41,219
Looking right, you hear a roaring noise.

1972
02:38:41,219 --> 02:38:44,219
And could just make out a beautiful, majestic waterfall.

1973
02:38:44,219 --> 02:38:46,399
Plunging from a cliff into a great rock bowl.

1974
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:49,700
You watch for a few minutes, marveling at how clear the water seems.

1975
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:52,260
Then it's time to move on.

1976
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:55,629
You follow the track down a steep deadline.

1977
02:38:55,629 --> 02:38:56,930
Deadine?

1978
02:38:56,930 --> 02:38:59,639
Whatever that is.

1979
02:38:59,639 --> 02:39:00,639
Okay.

1980
02:39:00,639 --> 02:39:03,159
Only one way to go here.

1981
02:39:03,159 --> 02:39:05,159
Bridge of Van Kass.

1982
02:39:05,159 --> 02:39:06,979
Deadine.

1983
02:39:06,979 --> 02:39:12,760
I'm sorry.

1984
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:14,760
Some way down the hill, you stop for a rest.

1985
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,760
And sit on a boulder to survey what lies ahead.

1986
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:21,129
The path leads downwards and at its foot, cradled between three peaks is a village.

1987
02:39:21,129 --> 02:39:23,629
And quite a large one at that.

1988
02:39:23,629 --> 02:39:25,629
Behind you, the sun is falling rapidly into the hills.

1989
02:39:25,629 --> 02:39:29,659
It will be night soon.

1990
02:39:29,659 --> 02:39:30,659
Could approach it or avoid it.

1991
02:39:30,659 --> 02:39:48,329
What do you think?

1992
02:39:48,329 --> 02:39:50,469
Should we get a poll?

1993
02:39:50,469 --> 02:39:51,469
Poll time?

1994
02:39:51,469 --> 02:39:53,280
In the village or avoid the village?

1995
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:54,719
It's always approach the village, right?

1996
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:58,659
Although, look, another village to kill.

1997
02:39:58,659 --> 02:40:08,129
Yeah, everybody's going to say pro.

1998
02:40:08,129 --> 02:40:11,129
I don't think there's ever a scenario where you avoid villages.

1999
02:40:11,129 --> 02:40:13,129
I mean, it changes things though.

2000
02:40:13,129 --> 02:40:16,129
You actually don't go to the village and you go completely somewhere else.

2001
02:40:16,129 --> 02:40:19,270
You end up in like the woods.

2002
02:40:19,270 --> 02:40:20,270
Yeah.

2003
02:40:20,270 --> 02:40:25,159
I mean, it's a bit that.

2004
02:40:25,159 --> 02:40:26,159
That is no way.

2005
02:40:26,159 --> 02:40:28,479
Okay.

2006
02:40:28,479 --> 02:40:31,069
Let's go in.

2007
02:40:31,069 --> 02:40:32,069
The village looks like a good place to stop.

2008
02:40:32,069 --> 02:40:37,069
You hop down from the boulder and make your way forward when an overhanging branch touches your face.

2009
02:40:37,069 --> 02:40:39,069
And you hear a lively chirping.

2010
02:40:39,069 --> 02:40:44,340
Hey guys, I think I remember this.

2011
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:46,799
I think so.

2012
02:40:46,799 --> 02:40:47,799
If I remember correctly.

2013
02:40:47,799 --> 02:40:52,239
Turn around.

2014
02:40:52,239 --> 02:40:54,239
You turn around quickly.

2015
02:40:54,239 --> 02:40:59,239
Hovering by your shoulder is a small creature the size of a bird.

2016
02:40:59,239 --> 02:41:05,799
It is childlike, but very thin with green skin and it flits around you on transparent wings.

2017
02:41:05,799 --> 02:41:07,110
It seems friendly enough.

2018
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:09,110
It even lands on your shoulder.

2019
02:41:09,110 --> 02:41:12,110
It's tiny clawed toes pinching slightly.

2020
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:17,760
Talk to it.

2021
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:18,760
Shake it loose.

2022
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:20,760
Cast a spell or carry on.

2023
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:35,750
Nothing with H greatest shield.

2024
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:36,750
W.

2025
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:37,750
Okay.

2026
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:42,399
Wall is creating an invisible wall.

2027
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:45,620
Yeah.

2028
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:46,620
Bye bye.

2029
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:47,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2030
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:48,620
No spoilers.

2031
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:50,860
Some of no spoilers.

2032
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:58,370
No spoilers.

2033
02:41:58,370 --> 02:42:04,430
There are a lot of people that don't know what this is cause fear.

2034
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:09,360
Get rid of them.

2035
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:12,389
All right.

2036
02:42:12,389 --> 02:42:14,270
Let's we'll talk.

2037
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:15,270
Talk to it.

2038
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:18,850
Greetings little creature.

2039
02:42:18,850 --> 02:42:20,030
And hello to you.

2040
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:21,030
The creature replies chirping.

2041
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:23,030
My name is Jan.

2042
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:27,719
It's Jan.

2043
02:42:27,719 --> 02:42:29,219
What are you?

2044
02:42:29,219 --> 02:42:30,219
What do you want with me?

2045
02:42:30,219 --> 02:42:34,469
See that village?

2046
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:35,469
The creature replies.

2047
02:42:35,469 --> 02:42:39,469
Last time I tried to go through, they told me I wasn't welcome.

2048
02:42:39,469 --> 02:42:41,469
So I wouldn't mind some protection.

2049
02:42:41,469 --> 02:42:45,329
I can protect you.

2050
02:42:45,329 --> 02:42:46,329
What are you?

2051
02:42:46,329 --> 02:42:48,329
Where I'm going is dangerous.

2052
02:42:48,329 --> 02:42:52,129
No spoilers, please.

2053
02:42:52,129 --> 02:43:01,729
If it's supposed to be the Elmo voice.

2054
02:43:01,729 --> 02:43:03,420
Did I do?

2055
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:07,680
What did I do for a voice last time?

2056
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:09,680
What was the voice last time?

2057
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:14,120
What are you?

2058
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:19,840
It was Elmo.

2059
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:21,209
Was it?

2060
02:43:21,209 --> 02:43:23,090
It was the Elmo voice?

2061
02:43:23,090 --> 02:43:24,090
No, it was not.

2062
02:43:24,090 --> 02:43:25,090
All right.

2063
02:43:25,090 --> 02:43:26,399
What are you?

2064
02:43:26,399 --> 02:43:28,700
The creature does a backflip and gives a low bow.

2065
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:30,000
I'm Minnie.

2066
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I'm a Minnie Mutt.

2067
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Pleased to meet you.

2068
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:36,000
It reaches out a tiny hand and shakes your earlobe.

2069
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,309
The creature starts hopping up and down.

2070
02:43:38,309 --> 02:43:39,739
Come on.

2071
02:43:39,739 --> 02:43:40,739
Let's get going.

2072
02:43:40,739 --> 02:43:41,739
Can't we?

2073
02:43:41,739 --> 02:43:42,979
Is that correct?

2074
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:44,409
That's it.

2075
02:43:44,409 --> 02:43:46,420
Okay.

2076
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:47,420
I'm not going anywhere till you're gone.

2077
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:48,420
What can you tell me about the village?

2078
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:52,920
I can protect you.

2079
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:53,920
What do you know about the village?

2080
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,250
You point down the valley.

2081
02:43:56,250 --> 02:43:57,250
Is it safe?

2082
02:43:57,250 --> 02:43:59,069
That's biratanti.

2083
02:43:59,069 --> 02:44:00,069
It's very safe.

2084
02:44:01,069 --> 02:44:04,239
It's the largest village in the whole of Schumann-Hutty Hills.

2085
02:44:04,239 --> 02:44:07,239
Every traveler who comes this way spends at least one night here.

2086
02:44:07,239 --> 02:44:16,520
So it's a little bit expensive, especially for Minnie Mutes, but pleasant enough.

2087
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:17,819
All right.

2088
02:44:17,819 --> 02:44:24,030
Hey, this is the replay of sorcery.

2089
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:26,610
We need a poll.

2090
02:44:26,610 --> 02:44:33,729
Do you want me to get rid of them or are we keeping them around?

2091
02:44:33,729 --> 02:44:39,940
We need a poll here because I know what happens at this point.

2092
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:43,309
I mean, I don't remember every single piece of dialogue,

2093
02:44:43,309 --> 02:44:48,399
but I remember sort of what happens.

2094
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:50,399
So we need some opinions here.

2095
02:44:50,399 --> 02:45:00,709
What should we do with this new friend?

2096
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:03,590
Keep them around or get rid of them.

2097
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:07,260
I hate him.

2098
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:12,469
Eat him.

2099
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:23,120
All right.

2100
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:30,760
Fuck friends.

2101
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:31,760
Fuck them.

2102
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:32,760
Fuck the friends.

2103
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:38,729
Get rid of them.

2104
02:45:38,729 --> 02:45:42,399
No spoilers.

2105
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:48,059
And stop effing.

2106
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:50,059
I keep dropping so many frames.

2107
02:45:50,059 --> 02:45:51,940
Why?

2108
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:58,739
I need somebody at Twitch to look under the hood and see why my connection has so much

2109
02:45:58,739 --> 02:46:02,739
trouble going to some of their servers sometimes with my internet being perfectly fine.

2110
02:46:02,739 --> 02:46:11,469
All right.

2111
02:46:11,469 --> 02:46:13,799
All right.

2112
02:46:13,799 --> 02:46:14,799
I can protect you.

2113
02:46:14,799 --> 02:46:17,680
The creature squeezes your shoulder gently.

2114
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:21,040
It's like having a spider trying to burrow into your skin.

2115
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:23,540
The creature flits to your other shoulder once more.

2116
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:26,909
You're not in any hurry, are you?

2117
02:46:26,909 --> 02:46:27,909
It observes.

2118
02:46:27,909 --> 02:46:29,909
Do you want to sleep out in the rough?

2119
02:46:29,909 --> 02:46:37,690
Where I'm going is dangerous, by the way.

2120
02:46:37,690 --> 02:46:39,059
Let's get going.

2121
02:46:39,059 --> 02:46:44,680
The creature shakes you by the ear in excitement and you set off along the path once more.

2122
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:47,950
You descend into the bowl of the valley.

2123
02:46:47,950 --> 02:46:52,950
The hills on either side are toweringly tall and throw the village into deep shadow.

2124
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:57,190
It would seem a very gloomy, threatening place, but from the streets come the distant sound

2125
02:46:57,190 --> 02:46:59,190
of laughter and merriment.

2126
02:46:59,190 --> 02:47:05,549
I mean, we can sleep outside.

2127
02:47:05,549 --> 02:47:06,549
We can go in the town.

2128
02:47:06,549 --> 02:47:11,649
It's an earwig.

2129
02:47:11,649 --> 02:47:15,360
You should have killed him.

2130
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:16,989
That was up to you.

2131
02:47:16,989 --> 02:47:17,989
That was not up to me.

2132
02:47:17,989 --> 02:47:18,989
That was up to you.

2133
02:47:18,989 --> 02:47:23,079
We're going to go in, right?

2134
02:47:23,079 --> 02:47:25,219
We're going in.

2135
02:47:25,219 --> 02:47:26,909
This is what I want.

2136
02:47:26,909 --> 02:47:27,909
I'm making this decision.

2137
02:47:27,909 --> 02:47:31,809
You continue along the path.

2138
02:47:31,809 --> 02:47:33,809
The sounds of festivities grow louder.

2139
02:47:33,809 --> 02:47:34,809
It's almost spooky.

2140
02:47:34,809 --> 02:47:38,989
Here in the shade of the valley and after so long on the dire road, the people in this

2141
02:47:38,989 --> 02:47:42,479
village seem to be enjoying themselves.

2142
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:43,479
See?

2143
02:47:43,479 --> 02:47:45,479
The minimite on your shoulder remarks.

2144
02:47:45,479 --> 02:47:47,979
I told you it was a happy place.

2145
02:47:47,979 --> 02:47:51,200
What's going on?

2146
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:53,399
Jan, what's going on here?

2147
02:47:53,399 --> 02:47:55,959
Are they bewitched?

2148
02:47:55,959 --> 02:47:57,200
No.

2149
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:00,639
If there was magic, believe me, I'd know.

2150
02:48:00,639 --> 02:48:05,559
This is the festival of the young.

2151
02:48:05,559 --> 02:48:06,559
What is that?

2152
02:48:06,559 --> 02:48:09,340
Well, take a look.

2153
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:12,879
Jan waves his little hand around the village.

2154
02:48:12,879 --> 02:48:16,879
The idea is that once a year, the children are allowed the freedom of the village.

2155
02:48:16,879 --> 02:48:20,120
It's a time of great fun and lots of pranks.

2156
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:22,940
It becomes quickly obvious what he means.

2157
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:28,420
You pass the first building, first few buildings, where you find a number of children sitting

2158
02:48:28,420 --> 02:48:31,920
in the street and drinking ale from deep mugs.

2159
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:37,350
Further on, a young boy is holding an old woman over his knee and is spanking her.

2160
02:48:37,350 --> 02:48:41,350
On the other side of the street, a group of boys is fighting outside a hut with a sign

2161
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:45,340
that reads, Glandragor's Tavern.

2162
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:46,340
Funny.

2163
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:51,649
You've definitely seen that name somewhere before.

2164
02:48:51,649 --> 02:48:52,649
Wait a minute.

2165
02:48:52,649 --> 02:48:56,260
That's the axe.

2166
02:48:56,260 --> 02:49:02,000
What the hell?

2167
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
The axe has that.

2168
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,489
Isn't it Glandragor's axe?

2169
02:49:05,489 --> 02:49:08,489
Dude, let's get in there and let's figure out what's going on with this axe.

2170
02:49:08,489 --> 02:49:12,680
All right.

2171
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:13,680
What am I doing?

2172
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,680
Am I going to rescue the old woman or am I going to leave this person?

2173
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:22,219
The idea is that once a year, the children are allowed the freedom of the village.

2174
02:49:22,219 --> 02:49:24,219
It's a time of great fun and pranks.

2175
02:49:24,219 --> 02:49:25,219
It becomes quickly obvious.

2176
02:49:25,219 --> 02:49:27,520
You pass the first few buildings.

2177
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:30,520
The children are drinking ale from mugs.

2178
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:32,469
What are we doing here?

2179
02:49:32,469 --> 02:49:41,879
We need a potential poll.

2180
02:49:41,879 --> 02:49:42,879
I'm seeing a lot of leave.

2181
02:49:42,879 --> 02:49:45,950
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.

2182
02:49:45,950 --> 02:49:46,950
I don't think we even need a poll, actually.

2183
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:47,950
There's a lot of leave.

2184
02:49:47,950 --> 02:49:49,950
Leave, leave, leave, leave.

2185
02:49:49,950 --> 02:49:50,950
Okay, leave.

2186
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:53,889
You consider helping the woman, but there's nothing you can do.

2187
02:49:53,889 --> 02:49:55,889
It is their festival after all.

2188
02:49:55,889 --> 02:49:59,629
All right.

2189
02:49:59,629 --> 02:50:03,399
I want to go in the tavern because we have the axe.

2190
02:50:03,399 --> 02:50:05,399
I one million percent did not do this last time.

2191
02:50:05,399 --> 02:50:06,399
Not a chance.

2192
02:50:06,399 --> 02:50:16,000
Behind the bar, a thick-set man is wiping mugs down with an old rag.

2193
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Greetings, stranger.

2194
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,549
I'm Glandrigor.

2195
02:50:19,549 --> 02:50:22,000
Can I be helping you?

2196
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,909
Greetings.

2197
02:50:24,909 --> 02:50:27,110
I've come a long way.

2198
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:28,110
I'm sure you have.

2199
02:50:28,110 --> 02:50:29,920
Take a seat.

2200
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,250
You do so, and Jan leaps up onto the counter.

2201
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:37,430
Glandrigor seems amused rather than alarmed by the creature.

2202
02:50:37,430 --> 02:50:40,760
I have something for you.

2203
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:48,459
Oh, yes?

2204
02:50:48,459 --> 02:50:50,639
He looks at you expectantly.

2205
02:50:50,639 --> 02:50:52,260
Give him the axe.

2206
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,500
Should I give him the axe?

2207
02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:56,319
Give him the axe right now.

2208
02:50:56,319 --> 02:51:00,950
Let's do it.

2209
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:02,959
Yeah.

2210
02:51:02,959 --> 02:51:04,959
You take the axe from your pack and lay it on the bar.

2211
02:51:04,959 --> 02:51:08,129
The old man's eyes light up as he sees it.

2212
02:51:08,129 --> 02:51:09,690
Where did you get that?

2213
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:10,930
He exclaims.

2214
02:51:10,930 --> 02:51:13,809
I bought it from a merchant, or it doesn't matter.

2215
02:51:13,809 --> 02:51:17,610
I don't know.

2216
02:51:17,610 --> 02:51:18,610
Which one?

2217
02:51:18,610 --> 02:51:22,409
Like, it doesn't matter?

2218
02:51:22,409 --> 02:51:23,409
Doesn't matter where I got it.

2219
02:51:23,409 --> 02:51:25,409
No, but wouldn't that mean maybe I like took it or something?

2220
02:51:25,409 --> 02:51:26,719
I bought it.

2221
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:32,370
I bought it from a merchant, but it's yours, isn't it?

2222
02:51:32,370 --> 02:51:35,120
He reaches forward almost nervously.

2223
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:37,299
He is clearly overjoyed.

2224
02:51:37,299 --> 02:51:41,180
I haven't seen this thing in at least 20 years.

2225
02:51:41,180 --> 02:51:46,069
I spent every day with it.

2226
02:51:46,069 --> 02:51:48,690
He mimes a gentle chopping motion with the blade.

2227
02:51:48,690 --> 02:51:51,870
Perfectly pitched at neck height on a goblin.

2228
02:51:51,870 --> 02:51:53,559
Incredible.

2229
02:51:53,559 --> 02:51:55,309
I remember the weight.

2230
02:51:55,309 --> 02:51:59,170
How did you lose it?

2231
02:51:59,170 --> 02:52:00,170
Why did you stop fighting?

2232
02:52:00,170 --> 02:52:01,170
How did you lose it?

2233
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:05,270
It was part of a raiding party.

2234
02:52:05,270 --> 02:52:09,569
There were four of us exploring the giant's ruins at Liyaki.

2235
02:52:09,569 --> 02:52:13,069
We descended into a cave system and the roof collapsed.

2236
02:52:13,069 --> 02:52:14,370
I was knocked unconscious.

2237
02:52:14,370 --> 02:52:15,680
They left me.

2238
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:17,680
Couldn't get me out, I suppose.

2239
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:22,239
Except that someone reached me enough to steal my famous axe.

2240
02:52:22,239 --> 02:52:25,079
Did you ever find out who?

2241
02:52:25,079 --> 02:52:28,850
Is that when you stopped adventuring?

2242
02:52:28,850 --> 02:52:32,180
He did onyxia with that axe.

2243
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:35,000
Did you ever find out who it was?

2244
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:38,920
No.

2245
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:40,920
He shakes his head sadly.

2246
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:45,850
No, I went on a healthy quest for revenge, but I never got it.

2247
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:50,520
Not something else instead that made me hang up my traveling boots.

2248
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:54,209
If you don't know what that is yet, well, you will.

2249
02:52:54,209 --> 02:52:56,770
Now here, I'm forgetting my hospitality.

2250
02:52:56,770 --> 02:53:01,520
Without putting down the axe, he quickly gathers a mug and fills it with ale.

2251
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:02,760
For you, on the house.

2252
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:05,200
You thank him and drain the mug deep.

2253
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:07,200
The beer is thick and refreshing.

2254
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:10,079
Then it is his turn to question you.

2255
02:53:10,079 --> 02:53:18,250
How long are you staying here?

2256
02:53:18,250 --> 02:53:20,709
Only for tonight.

2257
02:53:20,709 --> 02:53:21,709
Or I can't talk about it.

2258
02:53:21,709 --> 02:53:27,750
Only for tonight.

2259
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:30,700
I see.

2260
02:53:30,700 --> 02:53:33,000
Well, and he nods.

2261
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Let me give you some advice.

2262
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,690
There's a site nearby.

2263
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:39,190
A place called the Crystal Waterfall.

2264
02:53:39,190 --> 02:53:42,190
Whatever trek you're on and whatever you feel about sites, you should go.

2265
02:53:42,190 --> 02:53:44,680
It's more than just something to look at.

2266
02:53:44,680 --> 02:53:47,950
He grabs a bit of paper and scribbles down a note.

2267
02:53:47,950 --> 02:53:54,280
Hand this to the idiot who collects the toll and he'll let you pass.

2268
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:55,840
Okay.

2269
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,840
What's so special about the waterfall?

2270
02:53:56,840 --> 02:53:58,920
I won't tell you.

2271
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:01,280
That way you'll go just to find out.

2272
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:02,840
You nod once.

2273
02:54:02,840 --> 02:54:05,399
And once you leave, where to next?

2274
02:54:05,399 --> 02:54:10,909
To Carr or to Canterpani?

2275
02:54:10,909 --> 02:54:15,450
I mean, I already was at Canterpani.

2276
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:23,799
I would say to Carr.

2277
02:54:23,799 --> 02:54:26,190
Carr!

2278
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:27,360
Now there's a town.

2279
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:29,729
Listen, let me give you some more advice.

2280
02:54:29,729 --> 02:54:32,229
You're full of advice.

2281
02:54:32,229 --> 02:54:33,229
Okay, go ahead.

2282
02:54:33,229 --> 02:54:35,979
I have some powerful friends, you see.

2283
02:54:35,979 --> 02:54:38,280
He says, and his tone might be slightly threatening.

2284
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:40,780
There's a man I know.

2285
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,780
And he's quite an important man, too.

2286
02:54:42,780 --> 02:54:44,079
Name is Vic.

2287
02:54:44,079 --> 02:54:46,579
If you get into trouble, just remember that.

2288
02:54:47,579 --> 02:54:50,010
Even a name can be a thing of power sometimes.

2289
02:54:50,010 --> 02:54:52,510
Same as how you found me.

2290
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:55,389
This is bound to be useful later.

2291
02:54:55,389 --> 02:54:58,930
Advice Andy.

2292
02:54:58,930 --> 02:55:01,450
Who is he?

2293
02:55:01,450 --> 02:55:04,399
A man of power and influence.

2294
02:55:04,399 --> 02:55:07,069
A politician, you might say.

2295
02:55:07,069 --> 02:55:09,069
Anyways, you'll find out, no doubt.

2296
02:55:09,069 --> 02:55:11,690
He takes to wiping down the bar again.

2297
02:55:11,690 --> 02:55:14,959
So you'll be heading through Torrapani?

2298
02:55:14,959 --> 02:55:17,639
It's a Svin village.

2299
02:55:17,639 --> 02:55:20,079
No humans there at all.

2300
02:55:20,079 --> 02:55:22,079
The chief will probably try to persuade you to help his daughter.

2301
02:55:22,079 --> 02:55:24,379
She's been carried off by marauders.

2302
02:55:24,379 --> 02:55:28,729
Vic, for first and overly,

2303
02:55:28,729 --> 02:55:30,729
you guys remember, some of you do.

2304
02:55:30,729 --> 02:55:35,790
Of course I'll help or it's not my trouble.

2305
02:55:35,790 --> 02:55:40,079
Of course I'll help, right?

2306
02:55:40,079 --> 02:55:42,079
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

2307
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:44,379
Poor girl, she's been left as a sacrifice

2308
02:55:44,379 --> 02:55:46,379
in a dark cave guarded by a deadly manticore.

2309
02:55:46,379 --> 02:55:48,879
If you've not met one before,

2310
02:55:48,879 --> 02:55:50,879
well, watch your back

2311
02:55:50,879 --> 02:55:52,879
and your front.

2312
02:55:52,879 --> 02:55:55,180
And if you know a spell or two,

2313
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:58,559
then all to the good.

2314
02:55:58,559 --> 02:56:00,559
The beer is done.

2315
02:56:00,559 --> 02:56:02,920
You stand to go, nod to Glandrigor, and head out into the street.

2316
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:04,920
Jan flits quickly along behind you.

2317
02:56:04,920 --> 02:56:09,069
Or along behind you, right?

2318
02:56:09,069 --> 02:56:11,950
Alright, we going to the waterfall?

2319
02:56:11,950 --> 02:56:15,469
Okay, are we leaving town this way?

2320
02:56:15,469 --> 02:56:24,750
Are we going to find an inn or are we going to the waterfall?

2321
02:56:24,750 --> 02:56:27,309
Oh right, there was a mini dude.

2322
02:56:27,309 --> 02:56:29,309
Yeah, there is a little guy that we have.

2323
02:56:29,309 --> 02:56:34,379
Waterfall, waterfall, waterfall, waterfall, waterfall, waterfall.

2324
02:56:34,379 --> 02:56:38,920
Let's go.

2325
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:40,920
You head up a path that climbs through a crack in the mountainside.

2326
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:43,229
Soon the air is filled by a thundering.

2327
02:56:43,229 --> 02:56:46,219
It's quite a climb.

2328
02:56:46,219 --> 02:56:48,219
But eventually you turn a corner through a narrow cleft in the rock

2329
02:56:48,219 --> 02:56:50,219
and see close up the waterfall

2330
02:56:50,219 --> 02:56:52,219
you glimpsed from the hilltop earlier today,

2331
02:56:52,219 --> 02:56:54,649
lunging down from the cliffs overhead.

2332
02:56:56,649 --> 02:56:59,209
Large crystal stalactites hang down either side of the water.

2333
02:56:59,209 --> 02:57:01,209
There's only one path to reach it,

2334
02:57:01,209 --> 02:57:03,770
winding up the rock face,

2335
02:57:03,770 --> 02:57:05,770
and it passes by a small hut where a ruffian is collecting money.

2336
02:57:05,770 --> 02:57:07,770
and it passes by a small hut where a ruffian is collecting money.

2337
02:57:07,770 --> 02:57:09,770
and it passes by a small hut where a ruffian is collecting money.

2338
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:16,280
Uh, don't I have a note?

2339
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:27,340
Let's see what I can do.

2340
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:34,760
Dud? The illusion of treasure.

2341
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:37,000
Not the S. S?

2342
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Hey, sap, I can cause depression.

2343
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,780
Uh, I can do the clone thing again.

2344
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:45,659
I know, yeah, I have a note.

2345
02:57:45,659 --> 02:57:47,659
So I can just skip. I'm just curious what you can do.

2346
02:57:47,659 --> 02:57:50,479
Uh, yeah, dud.

2347
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:55,469
Cause speed.

2348
02:57:55,469 --> 02:57:57,840
Cause stench.

2349
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:59,840
Yeah, I have a note. I'm gonna go greet him.

2350
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:02,139
I don't need to do a spell.

2351
02:58:02,139 --> 02:58:04,889
Greet the ruffian.

2352
02:58:04,889 --> 02:58:07,129
You make your way over to the hut.

2353
02:58:07,129 --> 02:58:09,950
Greetings, you begin.

2354
02:58:09,950 --> 02:58:12,440
You collect a fee for the waters?

2355
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:15,069
These waters cannot be so healing that he has...

2356
02:58:15,069 --> 02:58:17,819
Whoops.

2357
02:58:17,819 --> 02:58:19,819
He glazes the ruffian.

2358
02:58:19,819 --> 02:58:21,819
These waters cannot be so healing that he has not caught an awful flu from them.

2359
02:58:21,819 --> 02:58:24,190
Read gold pieces!

2360
02:58:24,190 --> 02:58:29,629
You hand the scrawled note over to the ruffian.

2361
02:58:29,629 --> 02:58:31,629
You hand the scrawled note over to the ruffian.

2362
02:58:31,629 --> 02:58:33,629
You probably can't read, but he seems to recognize the penmanship as he nods furiously twice.

2363
02:58:33,629 --> 02:58:35,629
But he seems to recognize the penmanship as he nods furiously twice.

2364
02:58:35,629 --> 02:58:37,629
And then stands aside to let you pass.

2365
02:58:37,629 --> 02:58:43,950
The ruffian hands you a towel.

2366
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:48,879
Alright, let's get in the waterfall.

2367
02:58:48,879 --> 02:58:50,879
You head up the waterfall.

2368
02:58:50,879 --> 02:58:53,180
Which cascades forcefully into a deep pool.

2369
02:58:53,180 --> 02:58:55,180
You strip off your clothes and dive into the pool.

2370
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:57,180
While Jan flitters through the froth.

2371
02:58:57,180 --> 02:59:02,969
The cool water is fresh and invigorating, and you feel yourself getting rapidly better.

2372
02:59:02,969 --> 02:59:05,450
You feel a huge swell of confidence.

2373
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:09,159
Coming here was the best decision you have made.

2374
02:59:09,159 --> 02:59:14,680
Wait, this water cures disease.

2375
02:59:14,680 --> 02:59:17,870
Wait, this water cures disease?

2376
02:59:17,870 --> 02:59:19,870
Something about that seems terribly important.

2377
02:59:19,870 --> 02:59:24,270
People should be told about that.

2378
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:31,100
The villagers up on their lonely mountain, ravaged by the plague,

2379
02:59:31,100 --> 02:59:32,059
they should be brought here.

2380
02:59:32,059 --> 02:59:33,260
They can be saved.

2381
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:35,520
But it is late already.

2382
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:41,129
The walk back to the plague village will lose you a day, maybe more.

2383
02:59:41,129 --> 02:59:44,090
And with this place so close, they must know of it.

2384
02:59:44,090 --> 02:59:51,770
Perhaps their symptoms are too serious to be healed.

2385
02:59:51,770 --> 02:59:59,479
Leave them, start walking, or send someone else.

2386
02:59:59,479 --> 03:00:14,030
Start walking.

2387
03:00:14,030 --> 03:00:15,950
If you send someone else, they might not do it.

2388
03:00:17,959 --> 03:00:23,680
Shouldering your pack, you begin the long, weary walk back to the village of the plague.

2389
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:26,840
You're not really doing this, are you?

2390
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:28,809
Jan hisses in your ear.

2391
03:00:28,809 --> 03:00:30,489
You're crazy.

2392
03:00:30,489 --> 03:00:35,950
You ignore the small creature's complaints.

2393
03:00:35,950 --> 03:00:37,469
Walking overnight.

2394
03:00:37,469 --> 03:00:45,680
Let's go.

2395
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:49,680
After an hour, you are within sight of the rise up to the village.

2396
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:51,680
Jan is hopping mad.

2397
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:52,639
Where are you going?

2398
03:00:52,639 --> 03:00:53,840
I thought you were on a mission.

2399
03:00:55,389 --> 03:00:56,750
You don't have to come, okay?

2400
03:00:56,750 --> 03:00:57,719
You don't have to go.

2401
03:00:57,719 --> 03:01:00,219
This is important.

2402
03:01:00,219 --> 03:01:00,860
Sure it is.

2403
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:02,620
So is sleep.

2404
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:05,020
You say nothing but keep walking.

2405
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,559
A few minutes later, Jan pipes up again.

2406
03:01:07,559 --> 03:01:09,399
All right, all right, all right.

2407
03:01:09,399 --> 03:01:10,760
What is it?

2408
03:01:10,760 --> 03:01:10,920
What?

2409
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:11,719
What do you want?

2410
03:01:11,719 --> 03:01:15,290
Jan shakes his head, leaping up from your shoulder to flitter,

2411
03:01:15,290 --> 03:01:18,159
irritatingly, right in front of your face.

2412
03:01:18,159 --> 03:01:20,000
Listen, you can't go.

2413
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:23,159
I won't let you.

2414
03:01:23,159 --> 03:01:25,479
Why not?

2415
03:01:25,479 --> 03:01:27,719
Because I'll go for you.

2416
03:01:27,719 --> 03:01:30,360
Many mites can't catch plague, so there's no risk.

2417
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:31,959
And I can fly faster than you.

2418
03:01:31,959 --> 03:01:35,719
And if I save a whole village, I'm bound to find someone who will look after me properly.

2419
03:01:35,719 --> 03:01:38,059
He looks at you, expecting you to argue.

2420
03:01:48,190 --> 03:01:49,850
Good idea.

2421
03:01:49,850 --> 03:01:50,569
Come with me.

2422
03:01:50,569 --> 03:01:53,239
But what if I get the plague?

2423
03:01:53,239 --> 03:01:58,059
Get two birds with one stone.

2424
03:01:58,059 --> 03:02:04,219
You're going to kill Jan and the village gets saved.

2425
03:02:04,219 --> 03:02:05,659
Don't get scammed.

2426
03:02:05,659 --> 03:02:09,020
But okay, but if I don't see it, then it didn't happen, right?

2427
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:12,569
Oh, I can just go, I can go in the water.

2428
03:02:12,569 --> 03:02:13,370
Right, right, right.

2429
03:02:13,370 --> 03:02:18,239
But you know, what's the old saying?

2430
03:02:18,239 --> 03:02:20,319
If you want something done, do it yourself.

2431
03:02:20,319 --> 03:02:30,250
Come with me.

2432
03:02:30,250 --> 03:02:32,540
Jan shakes his head.

2433
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:35,520
You don't want my company.

2434
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,049
Trust me.

2435
03:02:37,049 --> 03:02:40,170
Then he turns and with a buzzing sound, he flits away into the dark.

2436
03:02:40,170 --> 03:02:41,290
You are alone again.

2437
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:44,959
The villagers should be in safe hands.

2438
03:02:44,959 --> 03:02:46,719
But you cannot stay to receive their thanks.

2439
03:02:46,719 --> 03:02:48,860
It is time to find somewhere to sleep.

2440
03:02:48,860 --> 03:02:50,620
With luck, you will reach car tomorrow.

2441
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:11,520
You wouldn't have done it.

2442
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:19,069
We lose Jan.

2443
03:03:19,069 --> 03:03:21,500
Wait, so what's bad about Jan?

2444
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:23,739
Ah, I don't think we tell anybody.

2445
03:03:23,899 --> 03:03:24,700
Don't tell anyone.

2446
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:31,209
That's something to experience on your own.

2447
03:03:31,209 --> 03:03:33,790
Ah, sleep outside the town.

2448
03:03:33,790 --> 03:03:34,670
I don't want to spend any money.

2449
03:03:34,670 --> 03:03:39,479
Well, maybe the maybe he'll let me sleep for free.

2450
03:03:39,479 --> 03:03:40,280
Yeah, no spoilers.

2451
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:41,399
No spoilers.

2452
03:03:41,399 --> 03:03:48,090
It's actually really, really interesting what it is.

2453
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:49,049
I need to know.

2454
03:03:49,690 --> 03:03:50,729
It's pretty cool.

2455
03:03:50,729 --> 03:03:54,940
It's very interesting.

2456
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:58,459
I wonder if will that guy let me sleep for free here?

2457
03:04:02,959 --> 03:04:04,799
Let's see if he'll let me sleep here for free.

2458
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:08,920
You find the village in buried under a rocky overhang.

2459
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:10,440
The proprietor stands in the doorway.

2460
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:13,239
A formidable young girl armed with a baker's paddle.

2461
03:04:13,239 --> 03:04:13,959
What do you want?

2462
03:04:13,959 --> 03:04:17,020
She squeaks at you.

2463
03:04:17,020 --> 03:04:19,659
Where's my friend?

2464
03:04:19,659 --> 03:04:20,540
Different inn?

2465
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:24,940
I don't know.

2466
03:04:24,940 --> 03:04:25,579
How much money do I?

2467
03:04:25,579 --> 03:04:26,139
I don't have enough money.

2468
03:04:26,139 --> 03:04:26,780
Room and board.

2469
03:04:30,010 --> 03:04:31,520
Room and board.

2470
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:32,959
Nine gold pieces.

2471
03:04:32,959 --> 03:04:35,899
What are you talking about?

2472
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:40,489
How much for a meal?

2473
03:04:40,489 --> 03:04:44,479
The girl looks down at you with a severe expression.

2474
03:04:44,479 --> 03:04:45,600
Four gold pieces.

2475
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:49,280
No discounts.

2476
03:04:49,280 --> 03:04:50,840
No, fuck that.

2477
03:04:50,840 --> 03:04:51,479
You shake your head.

2478
03:04:51,479 --> 03:04:52,200
That's too much.

2479
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:54,520
You run a lowly inn and not a palace.

2480
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:57,209
The girl scoffs back at you as you turn and walk out of town.

2481
03:04:57,209 --> 03:04:59,370
No, I'm going to camp outside.

2482
03:04:59,370 --> 03:05:00,940
Fuck that.

2483
03:05:01,899 --> 03:05:02,540
14 gold?

2484
03:05:02,540 --> 03:05:03,340
I don't have enough.

2485
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:07,549
I'll sleep outside.

2486
03:05:07,549 --> 03:05:11,209
You make your way out of the village

2487
03:05:11,209 --> 03:05:17,069
and into a stand of tall dry trees under the overhang of one of the cruel mountainsides.

2488
03:05:17,069 --> 03:05:20,670
Between curling roots, you find a small place to settle down and rest.

2489
03:05:20,670 --> 03:05:23,500
You're tired enough to feel your eyelids drooping,

2490
03:05:23,500 --> 03:05:25,340
but you're hungry from not having eaten.

2491
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:28,719
Oh, god damn it.

2492
03:05:28,719 --> 03:05:32,159
You pull out a quantity of your cheese and bread and eat it quickly.

2493
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:34,840
The night's darkness draws in around you.

2494
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:38,920
In the distance, you hear screams and whoops from the village that only slowly fade.

2495
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:40,729
You feel lonely.

2496
03:05:40,729 --> 03:05:46,399
Distanced from such revelry, you rest your head onto your backpack and close your eyes.

2497
03:05:46,399 --> 03:05:49,770
Perhaps a few hours pass when you wake suddenly,

2498
03:05:49,770 --> 03:05:52,329
aware of a shadow moving between the tree trunks.

2499
03:05:52,329 --> 03:05:55,719
It turns as it sniffs the air, a wolfhound.

2500
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:15,879
You raise the spell and when it's ready,

2501
03:06:15,879 --> 03:06:19,309
you take out the bamboo pipe and play a sweet and merry tune.

2502
03:06:19,309 --> 03:06:22,670
The stupid wolfhound finds itself racing in circles

2503
03:06:22,670 --> 03:06:26,600
and curling up into an absurd little ball.

2504
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:29,000
You play long enough and energetically enough

2505
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:32,670
that it eventually falls asleep upon a stone.

2506
03:06:32,670 --> 03:06:36,639
You hurry in the other direction to find yourself a new spot to camp.

2507
03:06:36,639 --> 03:06:39,930
Then once satisfied, you lay down again and try to sleep.

2508
03:06:39,930 --> 03:06:44,170
Your dreams are filled with walking with peaks and valleys and endless paths.

2509
03:06:44,170 --> 03:06:47,040
A curious light plays across them,

2510
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:51,149
building walls to heights before ruining them as it moves away.

2511
03:06:51,149 --> 03:06:53,399
And above it all, there is a warning.

2512
03:06:53,399 --> 03:07:00,680
Beware the black lotus.

2513
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:04,250
Bard playthrough.

2514
03:07:04,250 --> 03:07:05,530
All right, so we're going back up here.

2515
03:07:07,100 --> 03:07:13,129
Actually, that's interesting that we're going up here now,

2516
03:07:13,129 --> 03:07:21,000
not like this way.

2517
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,899
You rise early from your spot beneath the tree.

2518
03:07:23,899 --> 03:07:26,780
You rejoin the path on the far side of Viratanti.

2519
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:29,479
The sun sits on the horizon like a gleaming jewel.

2520
03:07:29,479 --> 03:07:33,280
If all goes well, you will reach Torrapani today,

2521
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:36,200
the last village in the Schumantanti Hills.

2522
03:07:36,200 --> 03:07:37,719
After a short climb, the path breaks,

2523
03:07:37,719 --> 03:07:40,280
heading uphill to the left and downhill to the right.

2524
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:46,190
With Torrapani so close, it hardly matters which way you go, surely.

2525
03:07:46,190 --> 03:07:49,479
But it does.

2526
03:07:49,479 --> 03:07:53,600
But it does make you a choice.

2527
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:56,620
You ignored the plague town?

2528
03:07:56,620 --> 03:07:57,340
No, I didn't.

2529
03:07:58,170 --> 03:08:04,399
I told everybody that it existed, and I'm hoping that they go there.

2530
03:08:04,399 --> 03:08:06,000
No, yeah, I told them.

2531
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:11,899
I'm curious what that does potentially later.

2532
03:08:11,899 --> 03:08:12,700
All right, poll time.

2533
03:08:12,700 --> 03:08:15,020
Are we going right through this kind of brush over here?

2534
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:17,180
Are we going left into this other brush over here?

2535
03:08:24,379 --> 03:08:25,260
Left or right?

2536
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:35,069
You didn't walk back?

2537
03:08:35,069 --> 03:08:36,010
No, I did.

2538
03:08:36,010 --> 03:08:36,969
It was back here.

2539
03:08:36,969 --> 03:08:41,899
It was like this little area here, this little zone.

2540
03:08:41,899 --> 03:08:44,190
There's no obvious answer.

2541
03:08:44,190 --> 03:08:44,829
No, there isn't.

2542
03:08:44,829 --> 03:08:48,280
I'm actually surprised I haven't really died.

2543
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:51,790
I know for a fact there's like at least 10 to 15 places

2544
03:08:51,790 --> 03:08:58,200
to just instantly die and magically avoided them all.

2545
03:08:58,200 --> 03:08:59,239
Okay, which way?

2546
03:08:59,239 --> 03:09:01,930
A lot of rights.

2547
03:09:01,930 --> 03:09:10,350
He did, yeah, the description was really quickly written.

2548
03:09:10,350 --> 03:09:13,549
No, I said it.

2549
03:09:13,549 --> 03:09:15,389
You yelled at the hotel lady and left.

2550
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:36,120
All right, we're going right.

2551
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:40,360
You climb a rise.

2552
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:41,799
The way is not too steep.

2553
03:09:41,799 --> 03:09:45,469
And as noon approaches, you have crested the ridge and are descending yet again.

2554
03:09:45,469 --> 03:09:49,559
You're now at the highest point of the hills where the trees are thin.

2555
03:09:49,559 --> 03:09:51,659
The view west goes on forever.

2556
03:09:51,659 --> 03:09:55,180
And sometimes you catch a glimpse of CAR on the northern horizon.

2557
03:09:57,719 --> 03:09:58,600
I'm not going to eat.

2558
03:09:58,600 --> 03:10:01,049
I only have one ration left.

2559
03:10:01,049 --> 03:10:01,930
It's probably a bad idea.

2560
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:02,889
I'm going to keep going.

2561
03:10:02,889 --> 03:10:07,770
You decide not to stop and eat, but push on.

2562
03:10:07,770 --> 03:10:11,770
A line of trees approaches the shadows between their trunks deep and threatening.

2563
03:10:11,770 --> 03:10:16,360
And then you are under the canopy and it takes your eyes a moment to adjust.

2564
03:10:16,360 --> 03:10:18,250
You come to a dead stop.

2565
03:10:18,250 --> 03:10:20,329
Something is moving through the trees behind you.

2566
03:10:20,329 --> 03:10:25,340
A moment later, a point of steel has emerged from the darkness between two trees

2567
03:10:25,340 --> 03:10:27,000
and touches your neck.

2568
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:30,079
You've seen me.

2569
03:10:30,079 --> 03:10:31,450
Whispers a voice.

2570
03:10:31,450 --> 03:10:40,399
I know it.

2571
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:42,239
Look into the darkness, walk away.

2572
03:10:42,239 --> 03:10:43,360
Answer, draw the sword.

2573
03:10:46,639 --> 03:10:47,520
No spoilers.

2574
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:49,930
No spoilers.

2575
03:10:49,930 --> 03:10:51,610
Keep those spoilers away.

2576
03:10:51,610 --> 03:11:00,639
I'm going to answer.

2577
03:11:00,639 --> 03:11:01,680
I see nothing.

2578
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,799
You call back.

2579
03:11:02,799 --> 03:11:05,399
You're quite safe.

2580
03:11:05,399 --> 03:11:08,200
It is not I who is not safe.

2581
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:09,000
Returns the voice.

2582
03:11:12,040 --> 03:11:12,600
Who is there?

2583
03:11:13,159 --> 03:11:16,440
There's no reply.

2584
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:19,639
But the tall dark figure of an assassin emerges from the trees.

2585
03:11:19,639 --> 03:11:25,100
He is dressed head to toe in black and you had not seen him a moment before.

2586
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:28,059
Even though he had been standing a mere arm's length away,

2587
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:44,280
he wields a sharp scimitar in expert hands.

2588
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:44,680
Fix.

2589
03:11:45,559 --> 03:11:47,079
Causes fixedness.

2590
03:11:47,079 --> 03:11:47,719
What does that mean?

2591
03:11:49,159 --> 03:11:49,959
Do jig.

2592
03:11:49,959 --> 03:11:57,739
Can I do jig on on this guy?

2593
03:11:57,739 --> 03:11:58,620
Walk a shield.

2594
03:11:59,950 --> 03:12:00,829
Oh, it freezes.

2595
03:12:00,829 --> 03:12:01,149
Okay.

2596
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:04,319
Zap.

2597
03:12:08,649 --> 03:12:15,850
Maybe I'll make a shield.

2598
03:12:18,569 --> 03:12:20,010
Is that the only fix?

2599
03:12:20,649 --> 03:12:24,170
I'll make a shield.

2600
03:12:24,729 --> 03:12:29,709
What was K?

2601
03:12:29,709 --> 03:12:29,950
Nothing.

2602
03:12:29,950 --> 03:12:30,670
Yeah, I'll make a shield.

2603
03:12:31,469 --> 03:12:32,270
You could fix him.

2604
03:12:32,270 --> 03:12:32,909
You can fix him.

2605
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:34,360
All right.

2606
03:12:34,360 --> 03:12:35,079
I'm going to make a shield.

2607
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:43,079
You lay a gold piece on your wrist and cast your spell.

2608
03:12:43,079 --> 03:12:47,639
The gold melts into your flesh with a burning sensation and a shield blossoms into place.

2609
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:49,479
You bring your sword up to bear.

2610
03:12:55,819 --> 03:12:56,379
Murder him.

2611
03:12:57,579 --> 03:13:01,579
That's actually pretty cool because that gave me an extra like 10 to 20 percent stamina bar.

2612
03:13:04,559 --> 03:13:06,959
F, F, F, F.

2613
03:13:06,959 --> 03:13:09,120
I hope this shit is fixed tomorrow.

2614
03:13:09,120 --> 03:13:11,200
I hope this shit is fixed tomorrow.

2615
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:13,920
I hope there's not any internet bullshit.

2616
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:18,040
Hope there's no internet bullshit tomorrow.

2617
03:13:18,040 --> 03:13:19,159
All right, here we go.

2618
03:13:19,159 --> 03:13:25,549
I think he's going in hard right off the bat.

2619
03:13:25,549 --> 03:13:25,870
Let's see.

2620
03:13:26,879 --> 03:13:28,479
Oh, bad.

2621
03:13:28,479 --> 03:13:28,959
Very bad.

2622
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:40,030
The assassin nods at you, taps two fingers against his chest and readies his stance.

2623
03:13:40,030 --> 03:13:40,829
Yeah, yeah.

2624
03:13:40,829 --> 03:13:43,389
My duty is to sever your head from your neck.

2625
03:13:43,389 --> 03:13:45,950
He declares in a voice is cold and polished as marble.

2626
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:48,360
You will not hold me from it.

2627
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:52,350
I'm going full blast again.

2628
03:13:52,909 --> 03:13:53,309
Okay, good.

2629
03:13:53,309 --> 03:13:53,790
I got it.

2630
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:54,510
I caught that off guard.

2631
03:13:54,510 --> 03:13:54,670
Good.

2632
03:13:55,709 --> 03:13:56,510
Time to attack you.

2633
03:13:56,510 --> 03:14:00,969
Rush forward with a deep heavy slash outclassing his own sword swing.

2634
03:14:00,969 --> 03:14:02,729
You catch him deep in the side.

2635
03:14:02,729 --> 03:14:04,969
Red blood soaks his black tunic.

2636
03:14:04,969 --> 03:14:08,590
All right, let's pull it back.

2637
03:14:08,590 --> 03:14:09,149
Yep.

2638
03:14:09,149 --> 03:14:14,319
You drop yourself into a crouch behind your shield

2639
03:14:14,319 --> 03:14:16,719
and he hangs back and watches you without emotion.

2640
03:14:16,719 --> 03:14:30,909
Okay, you hold firm and keep your shield high and he circles away.

2641
03:14:30,909 --> 03:14:32,510
He's going to go full, isn't he?

2642
03:14:32,510 --> 03:14:36,540
What the fuck?

2643
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:39,579
You circle around him at arm's length and he waits and watches you in return.

2644
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:43,520
Damn it.

2645
03:14:45,930 --> 03:14:48,329
Acting quickly, you swing a masterful swipe,

2646
03:14:48,329 --> 03:14:50,969
but the impact clangs against his turned sword.

2647
03:14:50,969 --> 03:14:52,010
He grins.

2648
03:14:52,010 --> 03:14:54,250
He is left breathless, but otherwise unharmed.

2649
03:14:54,250 --> 03:14:58,409
Closing his eyes, the assassin murmurs a quick prayer as he sets his stance.

2650
03:14:58,409 --> 03:14:59,639
I have to defend.

2651
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:03,709
Yeah, fuck you.

2652
03:15:03,709 --> 03:15:06,670
You whip up your shield as he powers forward,

2653
03:15:06,670 --> 03:15:07,870
but it only tires him out.

2654
03:15:07,870 --> 03:15:08,989
The shield takes the blow.

2655
03:15:08,989 --> 03:15:12,010
Oh, I don't get hurt.

2656
03:15:12,010 --> 03:15:13,290
Okay, he drained his whole bar.

2657
03:15:13,290 --> 03:15:16,280
I'm going to go light, like two, whatever.

2658
03:15:16,280 --> 03:15:22,510
Okay, he grimaces with effort.

2659
03:15:22,510 --> 03:15:24,270
Blood drips from the assassin's tunic.

2660
03:15:24,270 --> 03:15:32,639
He curses under his breath.

2661
03:15:32,639 --> 03:15:36,010
All right, ready yourself to block.

2662
03:15:36,010 --> 03:15:37,450
He steps away a little.

2663
03:15:37,450 --> 03:15:37,930
Do it again.

2664
03:15:37,930 --> 03:15:40,409
Oh, my God.

2665
03:15:40,409 --> 03:15:42,090
He's going to do it three times in a row again.

2666
03:15:42,090 --> 03:15:47,200
Again.

2667
03:15:47,200 --> 03:15:47,520
Again.

2668
03:15:48,639 --> 03:15:49,520
What the fuck?

2669
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:49,920
Stop.

2670
03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:56,350
You move around him watchfully and he hangs back and watches you in return.

2671
03:15:56,350 --> 03:15:59,719
Breathing deeply, the assassin whispers a mantra as he readies his blade.

2672
03:15:59,719 --> 03:16:00,200
Full blast.

2673
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:00,600
Let's go.

2674
03:16:02,719 --> 03:16:03,360
Got him.

2675
03:16:03,360 --> 03:16:07,680
Cast Earwig.

2676
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:12,959
Painting left, you dive forward with a deep, heavy blow.

2677
03:16:12,959 --> 03:16:17,129
He is off balance and moving slowly, and the blade goes deep.

2678
03:16:17,129 --> 03:16:20,329
He turns and tumbles, releasing his sword as he topples.

2679
03:16:20,329 --> 03:16:24,329
I am not so proud as to not admit when I am beaten.

2680
03:16:24,329 --> 03:16:27,260
You may finish me if you choose so.

2681
03:16:27,260 --> 03:16:32,200
But if you do, do me an honor and use my own blade.

2682
03:16:32,200 --> 03:16:35,559
The assassin is not dead.

2683
03:16:35,559 --> 03:16:38,010
Flies on the floor, gasping.

2684
03:16:38,010 --> 03:16:44,479
Finish him and search his body or spare him.

2685
03:16:44,479 --> 03:16:46,719
Chat, no spoilers.

2686
03:16:46,719 --> 03:16:48,430
It's time to decide.

2687
03:16:48,430 --> 03:16:58,809
Finish him and search his body or spare.

2688
03:16:58,809 --> 03:17:05,680
I'm going to leave this completely up to you.

2689
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:08,799
I know things about this game.

2690
03:17:08,799 --> 03:17:10,559
I'm sure a lot of people here do as well.

2691
03:17:10,559 --> 03:17:22,299
He has fought honorably.

2692
03:17:22,299 --> 03:17:23,579
Yes, he has.

2693
03:17:23,579 --> 03:17:28,760
You're right about that.

2694
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:29,879
Y'all are weak.

2695
03:17:29,879 --> 03:17:30,440
Finish him.

2696
03:17:33,290 --> 03:17:39,920
You need to kill him.

2697
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:40,319
Kill him.

2698
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:40,879
Kill him.

2699
03:17:40,879 --> 03:17:42,719
It's dishonorable to let him live.

2700
03:17:42,719 --> 03:17:43,440
Kill him.

2701
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:45,149
I have no say in this.

2702
03:17:45,149 --> 03:17:49,149
I'm going to let everybody decide here.

2703
03:17:49,149 --> 03:17:55,790
Whoops.

2704
03:17:55,790 --> 03:17:56,430
All right.

2705
03:17:56,430 --> 03:17:58,719
You have spoken.

2706
03:17:58,719 --> 03:18:08,459
We're going to spare him.

2707
03:18:08,459 --> 03:18:10,219
What's in the pockets?

2708
03:18:10,219 --> 03:18:11,180
I know, right?

2709
03:18:11,180 --> 03:18:12,059
I don't know.

2710
03:18:12,059 --> 03:18:14,459
We're not going to find out.

2711
03:18:14,459 --> 03:18:15,420
And get up.

2712
03:18:15,420 --> 03:18:19,559
You tell him, holding your sword back, but not putting it away yet.

2713
03:18:19,559 --> 03:18:22,299
He nods and sheathes his own blade.

2714
03:18:22,299 --> 03:18:24,360
You're an honorable man.

2715
03:18:24,360 --> 03:18:25,959
I'm glad to have met you.

2716
03:18:25,959 --> 03:18:28,040
Now you've saved me.

2717
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:30,079
You own me in part.

2718
03:18:30,079 --> 03:18:33,819
My name is Flanker, and I am an assassin and a thief.

2719
03:18:33,819 --> 03:18:44,250
For those of you wondering, six or seven years ago, I was a really, really big fan of Game of Thrones.

2720
03:18:44,250 --> 03:18:48,000
And this was Jorah Mormont.

2721
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:54,280
And I had a really good Jorah Mormont impression.

2722
03:18:54,280 --> 03:18:59,100
And I haven't seen the show in a long time, and I don't really give a shit about Game of Thrones anymore.

2723
03:18:59,100 --> 03:19:04,399
So, I mean, I'm trying to kind of redo my Jorah Mormont here.

2724
03:19:04,399 --> 03:19:05,920
And I don't know how well that's happening.

2725
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:08,059
All right.

2726
03:19:08,059 --> 03:19:09,899
Why did you attack me?

2727
03:19:09,899 --> 03:19:11,420
What will you give me for your life?

2728
03:19:12,459 --> 03:19:13,420
Why did you attack?

2729
03:19:13,420 --> 03:19:15,479
It's a simple matter.

2730
03:19:15,479 --> 03:19:19,229
I picked on wayfarers for practice and hiding and killing.

2731
03:19:19,229 --> 03:19:21,229
I assumed you would be no match.

2732
03:19:21,229 --> 03:19:23,129
But I see I was wrong.

2733
03:19:23,129 --> 03:19:26,540
He bows his head once, perhaps in respect.

2734
03:19:26,540 --> 03:19:28,889
Perhaps from the pain of his injuries.

2735
03:19:28,889 --> 03:19:32,270
You're traveling to Ka, he asks.

2736
03:19:32,270 --> 03:19:32,909
Yes.

2737
03:19:32,909 --> 03:19:33,389
No.

2738
03:19:33,389 --> 03:19:34,829
Why do you ask?

2739
03:19:34,829 --> 03:19:37,739
Why do you ask?

2740
03:19:37,739 --> 03:19:40,280
That is the way I'm going.

2741
03:19:40,280 --> 03:19:41,879
Well, perhaps.

2742
03:19:41,879 --> 03:19:44,600
I will not see you again once we part now.

2743
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:51,079
But if I do remember me, I will not forget the debt I owe you.

2744
03:19:51,079 --> 03:19:51,959
He is useless.

2745
03:19:51,959 --> 03:19:52,920
Finish him.

2746
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:53,959
That's so funny.

2747
03:19:53,959 --> 03:19:54,920
He is useless.

2748
03:19:54,920 --> 03:19:55,399
Finish him.

2749
03:19:55,399 --> 03:19:57,079
They give you a second opportunity.

2750
03:19:57,079 --> 03:20:01,760
You're turning into Johnny Carson.

2751
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:08,479
You're turning into Johnny Carson?

2752
03:20:08,479 --> 03:20:22,280
Oh, my God.

2753
03:20:22,280 --> 03:20:23,799
I could still kill.

2754
03:20:23,799 --> 03:20:30,329
I could still kill.

2755
03:20:30,329 --> 03:20:32,920
I remember you there.

2756
03:20:32,920 --> 03:20:35,840
He bows his head again.

2757
03:20:35,840 --> 03:20:38,120
This time it's definitely from pain.

2758
03:20:38,120 --> 03:20:40,379
Oh, you cannot aid me.

2759
03:20:42,510 --> 03:20:52,110
And I actually might be able to help him.

2760
03:20:52,110 --> 03:20:53,629
No, you reply.

2761
03:20:53,629 --> 03:20:55,229
I have caused your wounds.

2762
03:20:55,229 --> 03:20:56,510
I will help you.

2763
03:20:56,510 --> 03:20:59,340
He grins with gritted teeth.

2764
03:20:59,340 --> 03:21:00,780
Are you a doctor?

2765
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:02,139
I do not think you are.

2766
03:21:02,139 --> 03:21:02,639
Kill him.

2767
03:21:05,229 --> 03:21:06,190
They want you to kill him.

2768
03:21:06,190 --> 03:21:09,719
So they give you so many opportunities to kill him here.

2769
03:21:09,719 --> 03:21:14,379
It's three different times.

2770
03:21:14,379 --> 03:21:16,280
Bind his wounds.

2771
03:21:16,280 --> 03:21:18,360
Tearing strips of dark fabric from his clothing,

2772
03:21:18,360 --> 03:21:21,319
you bind his wounds tightly and the bleeding lessens.

2773
03:21:21,319 --> 03:21:25,760
You are too kind to a man who is about to kill you.

2774
03:21:25,760 --> 03:21:26,959
Let that be your lesson.

2775
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:28,799
You reply as you gather up your things

2776
03:21:28,799 --> 03:21:31,319
and head out of the forest, leaving him behind.

2777
03:21:31,319 --> 03:21:38,600
You have a sense that you've made a powerful friend.

2778
03:21:38,600 --> 03:21:40,299
Very cool.

2779
03:21:40,299 --> 03:21:44,559
Leave the trees.

2780
03:21:44,559 --> 03:21:48,170
You continue along the path and around the side of a hill.

2781
03:21:48,170 --> 03:21:50,329
A wooden hut is set into the slope

2782
03:21:50,329 --> 03:21:53,180
with an old woman sitting on the front step.

2783
03:21:53,180 --> 03:21:55,690
A river seems to emerge from beneath her.

2784
03:21:55,690 --> 03:21:56,889
As you get closer,

2785
03:21:56,889 --> 03:21:59,770
you realize the water flows underneath her house

2786
03:21:59,770 --> 03:22:02,889
and the house itself is set on a splayed struts

2787
03:22:02,889 --> 03:22:06,030
like an insect straddling the water course.

2788
03:22:06,030 --> 03:22:07,790
A few paces from the front of the house,

2789
03:22:07,790 --> 03:22:11,979
the water plunges over the edge of a sheer cliff and disappears.

2790
03:22:18,079 --> 03:22:25,790
Greet past or greet the woman.

2791
03:22:25,790 --> 03:22:27,870
Look, another woman to kill.

2792
03:22:27,870 --> 03:22:30,159
I didn't kill anybody.

2793
03:22:30,159 --> 03:22:33,079
I stole stuff from somebody's house

2794
03:22:33,079 --> 03:22:35,879
and accidentally casted a spell

2795
03:22:35,879 --> 03:22:40,440
that like turned off their brain for a minute, okay?

2796
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:41,639
I didn't kill anybody.

2797
03:22:41,639 --> 03:22:43,760
That person is not dead.

2798
03:22:43,760 --> 03:22:45,879
I didn't kill anyone.

2799
03:22:45,879 --> 03:22:47,079
Let's say hello, greet the woman.

2800
03:22:47,079 --> 03:22:48,969
Greetings, you call.

2801
03:22:49,049 --> 03:22:51,260
The woman looks up at you and smiles.

2802
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:52,940
Get over here, won't you?

2803
03:22:52,940 --> 03:22:54,620
I can barely see you.

2804
03:22:54,620 --> 03:22:59,440
All right, what do you want me to do?

2805
03:22:59,440 --> 03:23:01,200
Walk past the house or approach the woman?

2806
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:05,850
Let's do a pull.

2807
03:23:05,850 --> 03:23:08,270
Are we going in this house or are we gonna leave?

2808
03:23:08,270 --> 03:23:12,059
What's the deal?

2809
03:23:12,059 --> 03:23:24,299
What do you think?

2810
03:23:24,299 --> 03:23:25,500
Rewind to flank her.

2811
03:23:25,500 --> 03:23:26,139
There you go.

2812
03:23:26,139 --> 03:23:27,100
Somebody got it.

2813
03:23:27,100 --> 03:23:38,540
I like the water sounds.

2814
03:23:38,540 --> 03:23:41,659
Yeah, I love the sound effects.

2815
03:23:41,659 --> 03:23:44,430
It's just super calming.

2816
03:23:44,430 --> 03:23:48,170
This whole game is just like this.

2817
03:23:48,170 --> 03:23:50,649
And I wanna make this really clear to everybody here.

2818
03:23:50,649 --> 03:23:55,920
You're gonna get Elden Ring in about probably 30 minutes.

2819
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:58,969
This is the tutorial.

2820
03:23:58,969 --> 03:23:59,530
What?

2821
03:23:59,530 --> 03:24:00,329
What are you talking about?

2822
03:24:00,329 --> 03:24:01,049
I thought this was it.

2823
03:24:01,049 --> 03:24:03,420
No, this is the tutorial map.

2824
03:24:03,420 --> 03:24:11,100
Just saying.

2825
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:11,739
All right.

2826
03:24:11,739 --> 03:24:20,030
What are we doing?

2827
03:24:20,030 --> 03:24:22,040
All right, we're going in.

2828
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:23,159
Approach the woman.

2829
03:24:23,159 --> 03:24:26,989
You approach the old woman.

2830
03:24:26,989 --> 03:24:29,790
She smiles a toothless smile and gets up from the step.

2831
03:24:30,719 --> 03:24:32,079
Come in, please.

2832
03:24:32,079 --> 03:24:32,719
She beckons.

2833
03:24:33,280 --> 03:24:37,680
I get so lonely living out here on my own away from the villages.

2834
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:41,690
Go inside.

2835
03:24:41,690 --> 03:24:42,750
Thank you.

2836
03:24:42,750 --> 03:24:46,569
You follow her inside and take a seat by a long wooden table.

2837
03:24:46,569 --> 03:24:49,209
I'll bring us some tea, she says.

2838
03:24:49,209 --> 03:24:50,729
She sounds almost nervous.

2839
03:24:50,729 --> 03:24:54,440
Hurrying to her kitchen, she returns with two large cups.

2840
03:24:54,440 --> 03:24:59,709
Drink the tea.

2841
03:24:59,709 --> 03:25:00,750
Make conversation.

2842
03:25:00,750 --> 03:25:03,709
Let's make conversation.

2843
03:25:03,709 --> 03:25:05,420
The tea is still hot.

2844
03:25:05,420 --> 03:25:07,500
You cup it between your hands as you speak.

2845
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:12,319
This is a beautiful place, you remark.

2846
03:25:12,319 --> 03:25:16,989
Watching the river outside the door plunging away over the cliff face.

2847
03:25:16,989 --> 03:25:19,709
This is the top of the crystal waterfall.

2848
03:25:19,709 --> 03:25:23,340
The river runs right under my house.

2849
03:25:23,340 --> 03:25:27,420
They say it carries all my goodness and youth away while I sleep.

2850
03:25:27,420 --> 03:25:30,190
And the villagers bathe in it for luck.

2851
03:25:30,190 --> 03:25:31,389
She giggles meanly.

2852
03:25:32,030 --> 03:25:36,559
I'm sure it isn't quite true.

2853
03:25:36,559 --> 03:25:38,799
Don't drink that tea.

2854
03:25:38,799 --> 03:25:40,319
Don't drink that tea.

2855
03:25:43,370 --> 03:25:45,399
Drink the tea.

2856
03:25:45,399 --> 03:25:46,360
What's your name?

2857
03:25:46,360 --> 03:25:49,600
They call me Gaza Moon.

2858
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:51,479
She replies with a smile.

2859
03:25:51,479 --> 03:25:54,120
I used to be quite well known in my way.

2860
03:25:55,600 --> 03:25:58,780
You nod but you have never heard of her.

2861
03:25:58,780 --> 03:26:01,920
Don't drink that tea.

2862
03:26:01,920 --> 03:26:03,360
Why do you live alone?

2863
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:05,520
It must be more dangerous.

2864
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:09,760
Oh, no one bothers me about me.

2865
03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:11,600
Why would they?

2866
03:26:11,600 --> 03:26:14,809
You can't help but notice she has not answered the question.

2867
03:26:14,809 --> 03:26:17,610
You make to sip your tea when the old woman stops you.

2868
03:26:17,610 --> 03:26:19,930
Catching your arm before the cup reaches your lips.

2869
03:26:19,930 --> 03:26:23,899
Oh, I've forgotten the pot.

2870
03:26:23,899 --> 03:26:27,000
She goes back to the kitchen to fetch it.

2871
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,319
Drink my tea, switch cups with her, or make a run for it.

2872
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:33,340
What do you guys want to do?

2873
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:36,190
Let's do another poll here because what do you guys want to do?

2874
03:26:36,190 --> 03:26:36,989
What do you want to do?

2875
03:26:36,989 --> 03:26:41,360
I'm going to leave this up to you.

2876
03:26:41,360 --> 03:26:42,079
I remember this.

2877
03:26:42,079 --> 03:26:46,649
So let's see what you guys want to do.

2878
03:26:46,649 --> 03:26:52,879
It's fun involving the chat with this because when I streamed this game six or seven years ago,

2879
03:26:52,879 --> 03:26:56,219
I think there were like 600 people here.

2880
03:26:56,219 --> 03:26:57,739
This is I kind of I like this.

2881
03:26:57,739 --> 03:27:00,920
It's a whole new experience.

2882
03:27:00,920 --> 03:27:09,579
You guys get to live with your own problem right here.

2883
03:27:09,579 --> 03:27:11,899
Because some of the things I don't remember, but some of them I do.

2884
03:27:11,899 --> 03:27:13,340
And this is one thing that I do remember.

2885
03:27:13,340 --> 03:27:23,579
What do you want to do?

2886
03:27:23,579 --> 03:27:26,219
Why would she stop you if she wants you to drink it?

2887
03:27:26,219 --> 03:27:26,700
I don't know.

2888
03:27:27,659 --> 03:27:29,389
It's a good question.

2889
03:27:29,389 --> 03:27:39,520
Drink the tea, switch the cups, or leave.

2890
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:44,059
Looks like switch cups.

2891
03:27:44,059 --> 03:27:47,659
All right, which switch cups with her.

2892
03:27:47,659 --> 03:27:55,579
Let's do it.

2893
03:27:55,579 --> 03:27:59,239
While she is away from the table, you switch the two cups around.

2894
03:27:59,239 --> 03:28:04,000
Then when she returns, you lift the one closest to you and drink.

2895
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:08,090
A sudden deep pain grips your stomach and you double over.

2896
03:28:08,090 --> 03:28:09,629
What's happening?

2897
03:28:09,629 --> 03:28:12,989
You wince and cough as you find yourself seizing up.

2898
03:28:12,989 --> 03:28:15,149
Oh, suspicious stranger.

2899
03:28:17,549 --> 03:28:22,879
I can count on travelers suspecting my witchcraft.

2900
03:28:22,879 --> 03:28:24,079
I'll kill you.

2901
03:28:24,079 --> 03:28:25,280
Please release me.

2902
03:28:25,280 --> 03:28:27,200
Please release me.

2903
03:28:29,129 --> 03:28:33,420
You try to shout out, but you are paralyzed and quite powerless.

2904
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:36,920
The old woman begins to search through your bag.

2905
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:40,680
Then with a coup of delight, she pulls out the spell book page

2906
03:28:40,680 --> 03:28:43,770
you were given by the old man in the tree.

2907
03:28:43,770 --> 03:28:45,020
My book.

2908
03:28:45,020 --> 03:28:47,260
She cries, the missing page.

2909
03:28:47,260 --> 03:28:51,469
Oh, why didn't you tell me you had my missing spell?

2910
03:28:51,469 --> 03:28:54,590
She scurries off into the kitchen and returns with a cup of liquid,

2911
03:28:54,590 --> 03:29:01,069
which she pours into your half-open mouth while ducking and stroking your head.

2912
03:29:01,069 --> 03:29:05,610
It is an antidote and you feel your body slowly unfreeze.

2913
03:29:05,610 --> 03:29:10,909
Finally, she slaps you to bring you around.

2914
03:29:10,909 --> 03:29:11,790
What is the spell?

2915
03:29:11,790 --> 03:29:12,909
Who is the old man?

2916
03:29:12,909 --> 03:29:17,549
We got the page, but that saved us.

2917
03:29:17,549 --> 03:29:18,430
What is the spell?

2918
03:29:18,430 --> 03:29:21,600
Who was the old man?

2919
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:25,229
A rogue and a bandit.

2920
03:29:25,229 --> 03:29:29,399
Four days ago, I was visited by a traveler such as yourself.

2921
03:29:29,399 --> 03:29:33,690
But when I was away making my tea, as I always do,

2922
03:29:33,690 --> 03:29:38,079
he started leafing through my book and tore out a page.

2923
03:29:38,079 --> 03:29:46,120
He must have been a wizard of power because he vanished almost too fast for me to curse him.

2924
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:56,239
Will you uncurse him now?

2925
03:29:56,239 --> 03:29:59,120
Well, she looks a little uncomfortable.

2926
03:29:59,120 --> 03:30:03,000
I'd rather think it might be too late.

2927
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:07,770
I aged him to almost 130 years, you see.

2928
03:30:07,770 --> 03:30:12,250
I wanted to slow him down, but instead I sped him up.

2929
03:30:14,059 --> 03:30:20,120
She fuses with the page, preparing her spell book with some gentle magic.

2930
03:30:20,120 --> 03:30:26,079
You take the opportunity to leave.

2931
03:30:26,079 --> 03:30:29,040
Well, that's how that happens.

2932
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:38,510
I lose a spell, probably.

2933
03:30:38,510 --> 03:30:50,700
The guy in the beginning of the game was a wizard and he was not old.

2934
03:30:50,700 --> 03:31:06,750
Zen, Yaz, Sun, Kid, Yap, Wrap, Zip, Far, Zed, Zed, Rez.

2935
03:31:06,750 --> 03:31:10,959
Bring the corpse back to life.

2936
03:31:10,959 --> 03:31:13,680
You lost the C-A-T spell?

2937
03:31:13,680 --> 03:31:16,299
I don't remember.

2938
03:31:16,299 --> 03:31:33,309
She took something.

2939
03:31:33,309 --> 03:31:34,590
Yeah, I think she took something.

2940
03:31:35,549 --> 03:31:39,469
All right, outside the village.

2941
03:31:39,469 --> 03:31:40,670
We made it out of that one.

2942
03:31:40,670 --> 03:31:43,520
The old man gave you a page and she took it.

2943
03:31:43,520 --> 03:31:45,020
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

2944
03:31:45,020 --> 03:31:46,219
I hate losing items.

2945
03:31:46,219 --> 03:31:50,280
It is now late afternoon.

2946
03:31:50,280 --> 03:31:52,360
You pass over the brow of the next hill,

2947
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:57,200
and below you is the village of Torrapani, slung from one side of the valley to the next

2948
03:31:57,200 --> 03:32:00,399
like a flood barrier, observe.

2949
03:32:00,399 --> 03:32:05,069
Torrapani is a village of the Sphin, an aggressive-looking race of man-orcs.

2950
03:32:05,069 --> 03:32:09,469
You might expect their village to be rowdy, but it seems strangely quiet.

2951
03:32:09,469 --> 03:32:11,950
Go to the town.

2952
03:32:12,510 --> 03:32:13,549
Still, there's no way around it.

2953
03:32:13,549 --> 03:32:16,860
You will have to go through it.

2954
03:32:16,860 --> 03:32:19,959
Into Torrapani.

2955
03:32:19,959 --> 03:32:20,920
You enter the village.

2956
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:24,440
There is a definite air of depression hanging over the place.

2957
03:32:24,440 --> 03:32:27,879
The Sphyns are going about their business slowly and miserably,

2958
03:32:27,879 --> 03:32:30,909
and pay no heed to you.

2959
03:32:30,909 --> 03:32:37,209
You sit yourself down on a tree stump in the very center of the village to consider your options.

2960
03:32:37,209 --> 03:32:45,280
Find an inn or make contact with the villagers first.

2961
03:32:45,280 --> 03:32:46,079
You're illiterate.

2962
03:32:46,079 --> 03:32:47,200
I messed up one word!

2963
03:32:53,709 --> 03:32:55,229
We should probably rest.

2964
03:32:55,229 --> 03:32:58,139
We should go to an inn.

2965
03:32:58,139 --> 03:33:03,319
There are three inns in the village, but two are closed down,

2966
03:33:03,319 --> 03:33:06,200
their windows boarded and their thatched roofs rotting through.

2967
03:33:06,200 --> 03:33:10,270
The third looks a little better, but at least its door doesn't look very good.

2968
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:14,829
But it's still open, and the smell of well-cooked food drifts out.

2969
03:33:14,829 --> 03:33:18,590
From a sign by the doorway, it seems that food costs three gold pieces,

2970
03:33:18,590 --> 03:33:20,350
and a bed for the night costs five.

2971
03:33:20,989 --> 03:33:22,030
God damn.

2972
03:33:22,030 --> 03:33:33,020
Oh, I might need the ape later.

2973
03:33:33,020 --> 03:33:34,219
No, save the money.

2974
03:33:34,219 --> 03:33:36,200
The price isn't worth the value.

2975
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:40,319
You turn away intending to sleep for free under the stars instead.

2976
03:33:40,319 --> 03:33:43,840
You walk out past the borders of Torrapani and settle down under the trees.

2977
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:45,120
There's time to eat.

2978
03:33:45,120 --> 03:33:48,440
I have no more food.

2979
03:33:48,440 --> 03:33:51,959
You wolf down the last of your provisions, then rest your head and try to sleep.

2980
03:33:51,959 --> 03:33:56,159
Perhaps you manage a minute or perhaps an hour, but suddenly you wake,

2981
03:33:56,159 --> 03:33:59,360
certain that something is moving in the bushes nearby.

2982
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:02,250
Show yourself.

2983
03:34:02,250 --> 03:34:03,930
Pretend to be asleep or arm myself.

2984
03:34:03,930 --> 03:34:08,010
Pretend to be asleep.

2985
03:34:12,969 --> 03:34:20,879
Actually, that might be a play here.

2986
03:34:20,879 --> 03:34:24,159
You stay still, listening carefully, waiting for your moment.

2987
03:34:24,159 --> 03:34:26,649
But there isn't a moment.

2988
03:34:26,649 --> 03:34:29,850
Out of the bushes on either side, five figures leap forward,

2989
03:34:29,850 --> 03:34:32,010
each grabbing a different part of your body.

2990
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:34,329
Your ankles are held, your arms too.

2991
03:34:34,329 --> 03:34:35,530
We got him!

2992
03:34:35,530 --> 03:34:36,649
Cries a spin voice.

2993
03:34:36,649 --> 03:34:40,809
Then they are hauling your body out of the thicket and along the path back to

2994
03:34:40,809 --> 03:34:44,860
the village.

2995
03:34:44,860 --> 03:34:45,739
Where are you taking me?

2996
03:34:45,739 --> 03:34:46,299
Wait to see.

2997
03:34:46,299 --> 03:34:47,979
Pray to my spirit for aid.

2998
03:34:47,979 --> 03:34:49,920
Oh, we can pray to the ape.

2999
03:34:49,920 --> 03:34:58,520
Should we pray to the ape?

3000
03:34:58,520 --> 03:35:00,620
Pray to the ape.

3001
03:35:00,620 --> 03:35:05,440
In a whisper, you begin a prayer to your spirit, the ape, for aid.

3002
03:35:05,440 --> 03:35:07,479
Nothing happens immediately.

3003
03:35:07,479 --> 03:35:11,180
Then you reach a low hut and are thrown to the earth.

3004
03:35:11,180 --> 03:35:12,780
Your arms and legs are released.

3005
03:35:12,780 --> 03:35:14,459
Perhaps your spirit has heard you.

3006
03:35:14,459 --> 03:35:16,590
You cannot be sure.

3007
03:35:16,590 --> 03:35:19,709
But now that you have summoned the powers above, they will not help you again.

3008
03:35:32,649 --> 03:35:35,530
Somebody said, NFT ape?

3009
03:35:35,530 --> 03:35:38,489
No, dude, it's the it's the ape.

3010
03:35:38,489 --> 03:35:40,250
It's the do you hear that?

3011
03:35:40,250 --> 03:35:41,450
It's the ape.

3012
03:35:41,450 --> 03:35:47,920
The door is slammed and locked.

3013
03:35:47,920 --> 03:35:54,239
A moment later, it reopens and your possessions are thrown inside.

3014
03:35:54,239 --> 03:35:57,280
Wait to see what happens.

3015
03:35:57,280 --> 03:35:59,600
You pull your knees up to your chest and wait.

3016
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:01,950
The long watchers of the night pass slowly.

3017
03:36:01,950 --> 03:36:10,700
And in the end, nothing happens and no one comes for a daybreak.

3018
03:36:10,700 --> 03:36:11,819
Everybody has that dog.

3019
03:36:13,100 --> 03:36:14,159
Daybreak.

3020
03:36:14,159 --> 03:36:15,559
You're still alone.

3021
03:36:15,559 --> 03:36:18,750
An hour passes before you hear any noise outside.

3022
03:36:18,829 --> 03:36:22,250
And then the door to the hut opens and five spins come in.

3023
03:36:22,250 --> 03:36:25,610
They drag you roughly out and across the street to another hut,

3024
03:36:25,610 --> 03:36:28,700
where an old man with gray hair sits.

3025
03:36:28,700 --> 03:36:32,700
He's wearing outlandish, colorful robes.

3026
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:35,790
I name Prasius Chief.

3027
03:36:35,790 --> 03:36:37,979
He slaps his chest twice.

3028
03:36:37,979 --> 03:36:39,340
I apologize.

3029
03:36:39,340 --> 03:36:44,280
Then he bows, brushing the dust on the floor with his sleeves.

3030
03:36:44,280 --> 03:36:44,920
Rush him.

3031
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:46,969
Tell me what you want.

3032
03:36:46,969 --> 03:36:56,079
Apology accepted.

3033
03:36:56,079 --> 03:36:56,639
Rush him.

3034
03:36:56,639 --> 03:36:57,920
Punching, germa punching.

3035
03:36:57,920 --> 03:36:58,559
Rush him.

3036
03:36:58,559 --> 03:37:05,100
Did I just rush him?

3037
03:37:05,100 --> 03:37:06,750
Rush him.

3038
03:37:06,750 --> 03:37:10,190
While his head is bent, you spring up and rush at him.

3039
03:37:10,190 --> 03:37:13,229
You almost reach him too before the other spins catch you

3040
03:37:13,229 --> 03:37:15,790
and hurl you painfully back onto the ground.

3041
03:37:15,790 --> 03:37:18,920
The Chief looks at you sternly.

3042
03:37:18,920 --> 03:37:20,569
Brave.

3043
03:37:20,569 --> 03:37:22,090
This is what we need.

3044
03:37:22,090 --> 03:37:29,659
He waves to a menial who brings in bread and milk.

3045
03:37:29,659 --> 03:37:30,059
Eat it.

3046
03:37:30,059 --> 03:37:31,790
It's free.

3047
03:37:31,790 --> 03:37:33,950
Grateful you bolt down the meal.

3048
03:37:33,950 --> 03:37:36,829
It does not seem to be poisoned and it nourishes you.

3049
03:37:36,829 --> 03:37:41,040
The bowl is removed and the Chief squats down in a pool of cloth.

3050
03:37:41,040 --> 03:37:47,079
I have need of you and your strength.

3051
03:37:47,079 --> 03:37:47,959
I'll help if I can.

3052
03:37:47,959 --> 03:37:54,379
Tell me I will kill you.

3053
03:37:54,379 --> 03:38:01,610
I will kill you.

3054
03:38:01,610 --> 03:38:02,250
I'll kill you.

3055
03:38:05,879 --> 03:38:06,920
I will kill you.

3056
03:38:07,479 --> 03:38:09,079
The Chief nods.

3057
03:38:09,079 --> 03:38:13,260
No, I fear I kill you.

3058
03:38:13,260 --> 03:38:20,139
My daughter, my child, she is taken, offered to a terrible demon below.

3059
03:38:20,139 --> 03:38:22,030
She deserves it.

3060
03:38:23,790 --> 03:38:25,440
You want me to rescue her?

3061
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:28,989
I will try or die trying.

3062
03:38:28,989 --> 03:38:39,450
He deserves it, Omega Lol.

3063
03:38:39,450 --> 03:38:40,170
He deserves it.

3064
03:38:41,479 --> 03:38:43,309
You want me to rescue her?

3065
03:38:43,309 --> 03:38:44,829
The Chief nods.

3066
03:38:44,909 --> 03:38:45,549
Succeed.

3067
03:38:46,270 --> 03:38:48,110
And you may choose your reward.

3068
03:38:49,559 --> 03:38:50,520
Fail and...

3069
03:38:54,639 --> 03:38:55,600
Safer yourself.

3070
03:38:56,159 --> 03:38:57,319
I'll do it.

3071
03:38:57,319 --> 03:39:00,729
Why don't you do it?

3072
03:39:00,729 --> 03:39:03,959
Safer yourself.

3073
03:39:03,959 --> 03:39:07,610
He gestures to the other spins who is still taking no chances.

3074
03:39:07,610 --> 03:39:10,010
Grab you by your arms and haul you to your feet.

3075
03:39:10,010 --> 03:39:13,260
Crack in the ground.

3076
03:39:13,260 --> 03:39:23,520
You are led along a short pathway through the forest to a crack in the ground.

3077
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:26,879
One spin has brought a rope and another a basket.

3078
03:39:26,879 --> 03:39:34,989
They are preparing to lower you down into the pit of the earth itself.

3079
03:39:34,989 --> 03:39:36,989
You will pay me richly for this.

3080
03:39:37,629 --> 03:39:43,520
Take the adventure, try and escape.

3081
03:39:43,520 --> 03:39:50,059
I do have vague memories of this mission, by the way.

3082
03:39:50,059 --> 03:39:51,420
Giga Chad, escape.

3083
03:39:51,420 --> 03:39:54,459
I keep just running away and they just keep grabbing me.

3084
03:39:54,459 --> 03:40:00,670
And I keep losing health every time.

3085
03:40:00,670 --> 03:40:03,229
Take the adventure.

3086
03:40:03,229 --> 03:40:04,590
You will pay me for this.

3087
03:40:04,590 --> 03:40:05,709
Take the adventure.

3088
03:40:05,709 --> 03:40:07,610
Take the adventure.

3089
03:40:07,610 --> 03:40:10,409
You wait until they are ready, then step into the basket.

3090
03:40:10,409 --> 03:40:13,479
The Chief nods to you with respect.

3091
03:40:13,479 --> 03:40:17,079
Watch the darkness, he declares as they start to lower you down.

3092
03:40:17,079 --> 03:40:20,700
You hit the floor with a thud and peer into the darkness.

3093
03:40:21,469 --> 03:40:27,950
Your eyes can make out nothing, but a slight breeze suggests endless space in all directions.

3094
03:40:27,950 --> 03:40:31,229
You are blind, helpless, trapped.

3095
03:40:31,229 --> 03:40:34,639
Something clatters to your feet from above.

3096
03:40:34,639 --> 03:40:37,280
One of the spins shouts something down to you.

3097
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:42,360
Feel around on the ground.

3098
03:40:42,360 --> 03:40:46,920
You crouch down and feel around your feet until your hand closes on the base of something.

3099
03:40:46,920 --> 03:40:48,040
You pick it up.

3100
03:40:48,040 --> 03:40:50,780
It is a dry wood torch.

3101
03:40:50,780 --> 03:40:53,819
Something else falls from above and strikes you on the head.

3102
03:40:53,819 --> 03:40:56,200
Tinder Box!

3103
03:40:56,200 --> 03:40:58,190
Calls the voice.

3104
03:40:58,190 --> 03:40:59,309
Curse whoever hit you.

3105
03:41:00,030 --> 03:41:02,969
You hurl a curse upwards.

3106
03:41:02,969 --> 03:41:07,709
The spins, despite their concern over the missing tribe member, laugh.

3107
03:41:07,709 --> 03:41:10,510
The sound echoes like water between the walls.

3108
03:41:10,510 --> 03:41:13,920
Feel around for the Tinder Box.

3109
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:18,399
Rubbing the bruise on your head, you reach down and find the Tinder Box, like the torch.

3110
03:41:18,399 --> 03:41:23,500
You strike a light, and the torch blazes into flame.

3111
03:41:23,500 --> 03:41:24,219
Below.

3112
03:41:24,219 --> 03:41:31,360
You can see now you are in a large cavern, wide and deep.

3113
03:41:31,360 --> 03:41:35,020
At the far end, passageways disappear to the left and right.

3114
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:44,299
When uneven rock fall at the far end of the cavern, you hear a murmur.

3115
03:41:44,299 --> 03:41:45,260
Listen by the rocks.

3116
03:41:45,260 --> 03:41:46,299
Go left, go right.

3117
03:41:46,299 --> 03:41:52,329
It's time to decide.

3118
03:41:52,329 --> 03:41:53,049
He has the Tinder.

3119
03:41:53,049 --> 03:41:54,010
He has to swipe right.

3120
03:41:57,629 --> 03:42:10,909
Well, that's up to you, because we're going to listen to you.

3121
03:42:10,909 --> 03:42:12,829
Left, right, or listen by the rocks.

3122
03:42:12,829 --> 03:42:19,950
A pole is up to you.

3123
03:42:19,950 --> 03:42:25,870
Listen.

3124
03:42:25,870 --> 03:42:26,510
Rocks.

3125
03:42:26,510 --> 03:42:26,909
Tinder.

3126
03:42:26,909 --> 03:42:27,709
Swipe right.

3127
03:42:27,709 --> 03:42:28,750
Swipe left.

3128
03:42:28,750 --> 03:42:33,229
I mean, that's unanimous at this point.

3129
03:42:33,229 --> 03:42:35,180
We're going to listen.

3130
03:42:35,180 --> 03:42:38,620
You clamor over the rocks at the edge of the cavern to investigate the sound.

3131
03:42:38,620 --> 03:42:41,979
It is a whimpering coming from the other side of the pile of stones.

3132
03:42:41,979 --> 03:42:43,579
The spin girl, perhaps.

3133
03:42:43,579 --> 03:42:47,100
She came in this way, but then the cave-in blocked off her path.

3134
03:42:47,100 --> 03:42:49,239
We'll have to find another way to reach her.

3135
03:42:49,239 --> 03:42:55,149
Where are we going?

3136
03:42:55,149 --> 03:43:00,809
I'm not going to pick this.

3137
03:43:00,809 --> 03:43:01,930
Unanimous Andy.

3138
03:43:01,930 --> 03:43:10,170
Yeah, we're going to have to do, we'll do a new poll for this.

3139
03:43:10,170 --> 03:43:12,170
Unanimous doesn't mean anything now.

3140
03:43:12,170 --> 03:43:14,510
That's unanimous.

3141
03:43:14,510 --> 03:43:16,430
80% is not unanimous?

3142
03:43:16,430 --> 03:43:17,309
Yes, it is.

3143
03:43:17,309 --> 03:43:20,920
That's 80% is unanimous.

3144
03:43:20,920 --> 03:43:26,030
That's me just describing what that is.

3145
03:43:26,030 --> 03:43:27,790
Unanimous means 100%.

3146
03:43:27,790 --> 03:43:29,659
Oh, okay.

3147
03:43:29,659 --> 03:43:30,540
Sorry.

3148
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:33,260
Let's play semantics.

3149
03:43:33,260 --> 03:43:35,100
Unanimous means 100%.

3150
03:43:35,100 --> 03:43:35,579
Whatever.

3151
03:43:35,579 --> 03:43:36,540
I like saying the word.

3152
03:43:36,540 --> 03:43:38,280
It's a fun word to say.

3153
03:43:38,280 --> 03:43:40,860
80% would be majority.

3154
03:43:40,860 --> 03:43:41,340
Whatever.

3155
03:43:41,899 --> 03:43:42,860
But I like unanimous.

3156
03:43:42,860 --> 03:43:43,500
It's a cool word.

3157
03:43:43,500 --> 03:43:49,450
It makes me sound smart.

3158
03:43:49,450 --> 03:43:50,409
It's 50-50.

3159
03:43:52,170 --> 03:43:53,790
Good luck.

3160
03:43:53,790 --> 03:43:54,909
I actually don't remember.

3161
03:43:54,909 --> 03:43:56,840
So I can't help you here.

3162
03:43:56,840 --> 03:44:03,760
You're on your own on this one.

3163
03:44:03,760 --> 03:44:09,930
May as well do a coin flip.

3164
03:44:09,930 --> 03:44:10,430
Yeah.

3165
03:44:19,129 --> 03:44:20,409
Oh my God.

3166
03:44:20,409 --> 03:44:28,409
Oh man, this is, this is fucking unanimous.

3167
03:44:28,409 --> 03:44:28,909
Wow.

3168
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:30,569
Wow.

3169
03:44:30,569 --> 03:44:33,209
By four votes.

3170
03:44:33,209 --> 03:44:36,540
We're going right.

3171
03:44:36,540 --> 03:44:38,620
You turn right, creeping forward slowly.

3172
03:44:38,620 --> 03:44:42,110
The passage rises up a gentle incline.

3173
03:44:42,110 --> 03:44:45,870
At the top, a thick crystal seam glitters in the torchlight,

3174
03:44:45,870 --> 03:44:49,870
and the tunnel ends in a T-junction.

3175
03:44:49,870 --> 03:44:50,590
Look at the crystal.

3176
03:44:50,590 --> 03:44:52,510
I'm going to look at the crystal.

3177
03:44:52,510 --> 03:44:55,000
The seam seems to be made of pure diamond.

3178
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:59,719
It was no doubt in quest of this that these tunnels were carved.

3179
03:44:59,719 --> 03:45:01,799
But why is no one mining here now?

3180
03:45:01,799 --> 03:45:05,020
I want it.

3181
03:45:05,020 --> 03:45:07,120
Dig it out.

3182
03:45:07,120 --> 03:45:09,840
You try to pry some diamonds loose from the incredible seam in the rock,

3183
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:12,200
but your sword is not up to the task,

3184
03:45:12,200 --> 03:45:14,860
and you would only make it blunt.

3185
03:45:14,860 --> 03:45:16,700
You could perhaps return with a proper pick,

3186
03:45:16,700 --> 03:45:20,829
but only if you can escape these tunnels first.

3187
03:45:20,829 --> 03:45:25,440
All right, let's go.

3188
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:26,399
Left or right?

3189
03:45:26,399 --> 03:45:27,120
It's going to be quick.

3190
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:28,479
It's literally going to be 30 seconds.

3191
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:41,819
So are we back in the mines?

3192
03:45:42,540 --> 03:45:43,340
You are.

3193
03:45:44,219 --> 03:45:46,200
We are.

3194
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:51,360
Those mines that you're referring to are way down here.

3195
03:45:51,360 --> 03:45:53,079
This is where the goblins were.

3196
03:45:53,079 --> 03:45:54,719
We didn't go in here though.

3197
03:45:54,719 --> 03:45:57,229
Although they could, could be similar.

3198
03:45:57,229 --> 03:45:58,510
No, it's probably too far.

3199
03:45:58,510 --> 03:46:05,920
We've got the pickaxe.

3200
03:46:07,950 --> 03:46:10,829
I think there was a possibility to get one at some point.

3201
03:46:10,829 --> 03:46:17,790
Up, up, down, down, left, right.

3202
03:46:17,790 --> 03:46:22,889
Oh shit, I forgot to say pull.

3203
03:46:22,889 --> 03:46:30,719
Left, right, which way?

3204
03:46:30,719 --> 03:46:31,360
That's my fault.

3205
03:46:31,360 --> 03:46:38,159
I keep forgetting to say pull.

3206
03:46:38,159 --> 03:46:40,479
If there are 10 of these choices, are you going to do it every time?

3207
03:46:41,979 --> 03:46:42,700
I don't know, maybe.

3208
03:46:42,700 --> 03:46:43,819
It's kind of fun to me in a way.

3209
03:46:46,829 --> 03:46:48,190
Always right gang.

3210
03:46:54,649 --> 03:46:57,290
Honestly, it's still it's legit 50-50.

3211
03:46:57,290 --> 03:46:59,850
So I could just pick random ones if I wanted to.

3212
03:46:59,850 --> 03:47:05,120
Look at this.

3213
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:07,280
Always left gang and always right gang.

3214
03:47:07,280 --> 03:47:11,069
It looks like always right gang seems to be winning each one of these

3215
03:47:11,069 --> 03:47:12,030
by a very small amount.

3216
03:47:17,659 --> 03:47:20,409
And that's it.

3217
03:47:20,409 --> 03:47:24,860
Right.

3218
03:47:24,860 --> 03:47:26,639
You take the right-handed tunnel.

3219
03:47:26,639 --> 03:47:29,040
You walk down the passage for several minutes.

3220
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:30,559
Then slip on some dirt.

3221
03:47:30,559 --> 03:47:32,479
And the ground beneath your feet gives way.

3222
03:47:32,479 --> 03:47:37,389
You plunge into a hidden pit and land on something soft.

3223
03:47:37,389 --> 03:47:41,760
Lucky escape.

3224
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:43,159
Or maybe not.

3225
03:47:43,159 --> 03:47:45,159
Whatever it is you've landed on is moving.

3226
03:47:45,159 --> 03:47:46,920
And what's more, it's hissing.

3227
03:47:46,920 --> 03:47:54,280
You are in a pit of snakes.

3228
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:58,760
Oh no, the ape is far from you.

3229
03:47:58,760 --> 03:47:59,979
It's too bad we...

3230
03:47:59,979 --> 03:48:02,760
Why did we pray?

3231
03:48:02,760 --> 03:48:03,639
Try something else.

3232
03:48:03,639 --> 03:48:05,079
Use magic, pray to the spirit.

3233
03:48:05,719 --> 03:48:06,600
The ape is gone.

3234
03:48:06,600 --> 03:48:09,000
We used it because we were getting captured.

3235
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:12,139
What can we do for magic?

3236
03:48:12,139 --> 03:48:21,450
You ready a spell.

3237
03:48:21,450 --> 03:48:22,409
There's law.

3238
03:48:22,409 --> 03:48:29,069
There's illusion.

3239
03:48:29,069 --> 03:48:30,479
Pop.

3240
03:48:30,479 --> 03:48:31,120
Explosion.

3241
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:31,760
We need a pebble.

3242
03:48:31,760 --> 03:48:32,959
We don't have any pebbles.

3243
03:48:32,959 --> 03:48:38,590
Nothing with F.

3244
03:48:38,590 --> 03:48:41,049
There's zen hover.

3245
03:48:43,200 --> 03:48:45,549
Jig is not available.

3246
03:48:45,549 --> 03:48:50,920
Looks like law, pop, or zen.

3247
03:48:50,920 --> 03:48:52,750
There's no F, really?

3248
03:48:54,639 --> 03:48:55,520
I could do law.

3249
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:56,959
Probably would work pretty well.

3250
03:48:56,959 --> 03:48:58,159
If I had a grenade, I'd throw it.

3251
03:48:58,159 --> 03:48:58,719
Let's do law.

3252
03:48:58,719 --> 03:48:59,920
It's expensive, but it's worth it.

3253
03:49:00,479 --> 03:49:08,040
You cast the spell and feel the snakes come under your command.

3254
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:10,520
Order them back or order them to help.

3255
03:49:11,079 --> 03:49:13,100
That's interesting.

3256
03:49:13,420 --> 03:49:15,840
Let's order them to help.

3257
03:49:15,840 --> 03:49:20,159
You command the snakes to approach.

3258
03:49:20,799 --> 03:49:24,649
They slither nearer and nearer and then they begin to climb the walls,

3259
03:49:24,649 --> 03:49:30,170
holding themselves erect until they form a living ladder that stretches up the passage above.

3260
03:49:30,170 --> 03:49:33,290
Should I test it?

3261
03:49:34,170 --> 03:49:35,049
Is this bad?

3262
03:49:35,049 --> 03:49:36,170
Should I just go quick?

3263
03:49:36,170 --> 03:49:39,760
I'm gonna go quick.

3264
03:49:39,760 --> 03:49:48,670
You steal your courage and climb quickly back up to the tunnel.

3265
03:49:48,670 --> 03:49:52,270
Back on firm ground, you watch as the spell leaves the snakes and they tumble,

3266
03:49:52,270 --> 03:49:56,030
snapping, hissing, and hungry back to the cavern floor.

3267
03:49:56,030 --> 03:50:01,930
You're soon back at the crystal seam where a side passage opens on the left.

3268
03:50:01,930 --> 03:50:06,569
Go left or go straight on.

3269
03:50:06,569 --> 03:50:11,450
Left, I believe, would just take us back to where we just were, right?

3270
03:50:11,450 --> 03:50:15,600
Because we went right, yeah, so we're gonna go straight.

3271
03:50:15,600 --> 03:50:16,639
You push on.

3272
03:50:16,639 --> 03:50:18,940
Here the cave system widens.

3273
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:25,100
Pendulous stalactites hang from the ceiling as if about to fall and skewer you into place.

3274
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:29,840
You skirt between them, following a thin safe path until a passageway appears on your right.

3275
03:50:29,840 --> 03:50:34,940
All right, it goes straight.

3276
03:50:34,940 --> 03:50:37,209
Right, gang?

3277
03:50:37,209 --> 03:50:38,729
Okay, I'm gonna take the reins here.

3278
03:50:38,729 --> 03:50:39,850
I'm gonna say right, gang.

3279
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:45,040
You move through the opening in the right wall.

3280
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:48,170
After a few minutes, walk up a shallow incline.

3281
03:50:48,170 --> 03:50:50,719
You begin to hear something in the distance.

3282
03:50:50,719 --> 03:50:52,159
A low rumbling.

3283
03:50:52,159 --> 03:50:55,870
Turn and run, or just, what happens?

3284
03:50:55,870 --> 03:50:56,750
Let's see.

3285
03:50:56,750 --> 03:51:00,090
I think I'm in trouble here.

3286
03:51:00,090 --> 03:51:10,280
Let's, you turn and run, but not fast enough.

3287
03:51:10,280 --> 03:51:12,680
The rumbling gets louder and louder until you look over your shoulder

3288
03:51:12,680 --> 03:51:16,920
to see an enormous boulder rolling speedily down the tunnel towards you.

3289
03:51:16,920 --> 03:51:19,479
The ape is not here.

3290
03:51:19,479 --> 03:51:22,489
Do I have, can I cast a spell?

3291
03:51:22,489 --> 03:51:29,129
Probably something.

3292
03:51:29,129 --> 03:51:33,790
You check the stars to see what spells are available to you.

3293
03:51:37,579 --> 03:51:41,879
Right, gang, and shambles.

3294
03:51:41,879 --> 03:51:42,600
Gum?

3295
03:51:42,600 --> 03:51:44,139
Create glue.

3296
03:51:44,139 --> 03:51:48,399
I don't have any glue.

3297
03:51:48,399 --> 03:51:49,370
Wall.

3298
03:51:49,370 --> 03:51:50,489
Create an invisible wall.

3299
03:51:50,489 --> 03:51:51,450
That's a good one.

3300
03:51:51,450 --> 03:51:56,299
That's three health, though.

3301
03:51:56,299 --> 03:51:56,780
Fix.

3302
03:51:56,780 --> 03:51:57,659
Cause fixness.

3303
03:52:00,889 --> 03:52:01,290
Ball.

3304
03:52:01,290 --> 03:52:02,489
Float in the air.

3305
03:52:02,489 --> 03:52:05,610
Wouldn't it still just hit me, and I'm just floating?

3306
03:52:05,610 --> 03:52:08,399
I think it has to be wall.

3307
03:52:08,399 --> 03:52:27,770
It's expensive, but you'll float above it, will I?

3308
03:52:27,770 --> 03:52:28,250
Will I?

3309
03:52:31,000 --> 03:52:32,680
Is there enough room to float above it?

3310
03:52:32,680 --> 03:52:36,700
I'm doing wall.

3311
03:52:36,700 --> 03:52:40,479
You cast your spell just in time,

3312
03:52:40,479 --> 03:52:43,760
and the great boulder hits your invisible wall with considerable force,

3313
03:52:44,319 --> 03:52:47,040
causing the whole cave to shake and shudder.

3314
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:50,319
Then the boulder holds in place like a pawing horse.

3315
03:52:50,319 --> 03:52:52,399
But your spell will not last long.

3316
03:52:52,399 --> 03:52:53,440
You'd better move on.

3317
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:56,680
All right, go right.

3318
03:52:56,680 --> 03:52:57,770
Swipe right.

3319
03:52:57,770 --> 03:53:04,889
The passageway slopes down a short way, then a crack splits the wall on the left.

3320
03:53:04,889 --> 03:53:08,090
Two stones are stacked on top of one another against the wall here.

3321
03:53:08,090 --> 03:53:10,719
Dammit, the stones.

3322
03:53:10,719 --> 03:53:13,209
There's nothing special about the two stones,

3323
03:53:13,209 --> 03:53:15,690
except that they happen to be on top of one another.

3324
03:53:15,690 --> 03:53:28,969
Turn back, go left.

3325
03:53:28,969 --> 03:53:29,530
Right, gang.

3326
03:53:29,530 --> 03:53:31,049
There is no right right now.

3327
03:53:31,049 --> 03:53:34,680
Go left, go left, go left, go left.

3328
03:53:34,680 --> 03:53:36,280
Straight, left, left, left.

3329
03:53:36,280 --> 03:53:38,520
How long can you hold a note for?

3330
03:53:38,520 --> 03:53:46,909
I held a Wilma for about 45 seconds, so a long time.

3331
03:53:46,909 --> 03:53:48,379
Left.

3332
03:53:48,379 --> 03:53:49,579
Anything but left.

3333
03:53:49,579 --> 03:53:50,379
Left, gang.

3334
03:53:50,379 --> 03:53:51,420
Right, gang, had their time.

3335
03:53:51,420 --> 03:53:54,879
It's time for left, gang.

3336
03:53:54,879 --> 03:53:56,409
You go left.

3337
03:53:56,409 --> 03:54:00,329
Then you spot, you see a spot of sunlight up ahead and rush forward

3338
03:54:00,329 --> 03:54:03,690
to find yourself back beneath the crack in the ceiling through which you came.

3339
03:54:06,860 --> 03:54:10,409
Climb out of the hole.

3340
03:54:10,409 --> 03:54:11,129
I'm out of here.

3341
03:54:11,129 --> 03:54:14,239
Get me the fuck out of this hole.

3342
03:54:14,239 --> 03:54:14,799
Left, gang.

3343
03:54:14,799 --> 03:54:15,360
Come on, man.

3344
03:54:15,360 --> 03:54:17,360
What have you done?

3345
03:54:17,360 --> 03:54:18,879
Can I climb out of the hole?

3346
03:54:18,879 --> 03:54:23,920
You set your toes into a crevice near the base of the rock wall and begin to try to

3347
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:25,360
climb your way out.

3348
03:54:25,360 --> 03:54:30,799
The stone is coarse and cruel on your fingers and soon you have cuts below your knuckles

3349
03:54:30,799 --> 03:54:33,049
and on your knees and elbows.

3350
03:54:33,049 --> 03:54:41,280
Halfway up, the slope of the crack begins to curve over and the going gets more difficult.

3351
03:54:41,280 --> 03:54:42,159
Keep going.

3352
03:54:42,159 --> 03:54:44,250
You will not give up.

3353
03:54:44,250 --> 03:54:48,090
You keep climbing, one hand after the next, testing every foothold.

3354
03:54:48,090 --> 03:54:51,690
After some more effort with blood trickling between your closed fingers,

3355
03:54:51,770 --> 03:54:54,399
you are within a few reaches of the sunlight.

3356
03:54:54,399 --> 03:54:56,799
That's when they notice what you're doing.

3357
03:54:56,799 --> 03:55:01,819
A svin eye appears over the lip of the crack, then something.

3358
03:55:01,819 --> 03:55:06,959
One end of the coiled rope is dropped straight into your face.

3359
03:55:06,959 --> 03:55:08,559
You lose your grip and fall.

3360
03:55:08,559 --> 03:55:11,100
Do I survive?

3361
03:55:11,100 --> 03:55:13,819
You hit the floor with a horrible crunch.

3362
03:55:13,819 --> 03:55:18,719
Your ankle is badly twisted and you are lucky to not have broken your neck.

3363
03:55:18,719 --> 03:55:21,360
The rope is quickly whisked up again out of sight.

3364
03:55:22,600 --> 03:55:24,889
Get me out of here.

3365
03:55:24,889 --> 03:55:26,569
You ball up to the sky.

3366
03:55:26,569 --> 03:55:31,069
There is no reply and no rope is lowered down.

3367
03:55:31,069 --> 03:55:32,350
Classic left gang.

3368
03:55:32,350 --> 03:55:37,920
Okay, we're going straight on again.

3369
03:55:37,920 --> 03:55:40,879
You creep forwards through the dark, quite sure you are going in circles.

3370
03:55:40,879 --> 03:55:41,930
The ground begins to...

3371
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:46,159
Oh, that's so stupid.

3372
03:55:46,159 --> 03:55:49,120
The ground begins to slope upwards and the walls begin to glitter

3373
03:55:49,120 --> 03:55:51,280
as you encounter a seam of crystal.

3374
03:55:51,280 --> 03:55:53,120
Have you been this way before?

3375
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:59,600
Here the passage you are following splits.

3376
03:55:59,600 --> 03:56:00,719
You climbed out.

3377
03:56:04,190 --> 03:56:05,069
Left gang.

3378
03:56:05,069 --> 03:56:07,930
Left gang.

3379
03:56:07,930 --> 03:56:09,049
You take the left passage.

3380
03:56:09,049 --> 03:56:11,290
The way is soon blocked by a large boulder.

3381
03:56:11,290 --> 03:56:12,250
You turn back.

3382
03:56:12,250 --> 03:56:18,559
You're soon back in the crystal seam where a crawl space gapes on your right.

3383
03:56:18,559 --> 03:56:20,639
Right gang.

3384
03:56:20,639 --> 03:56:24,620
Soon you're back in the spot of sunlight below the opening in the ceiling.

3385
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:25,180
Turn around.

3386
03:56:25,180 --> 03:56:26,809
Go straight.

3387
03:56:26,809 --> 03:56:30,010
You move onwards along the tunnel, quite sure you're going in circles.

3388
03:56:30,010 --> 03:56:33,209
This ground seems to dip and its lowest point,

3389
03:56:33,209 --> 03:56:36,329
the path you were creeping through finishes at another fork.

3390
03:56:36,329 --> 03:56:39,020
There's a stacked pair of stones here as well.

3391
03:56:39,020 --> 03:56:42,239
Run the pole.

3392
03:56:42,239 --> 03:56:43,120
Actually, I can do it.

3393
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:50,799
Turn back.

3394
03:56:50,799 --> 03:56:51,280
What is it?

3395
03:56:51,280 --> 03:56:51,680
Straight.

3396
03:56:51,680 --> 03:56:52,399
Turn back.

3397
03:56:52,399 --> 03:56:53,559
Turn back.

3398
03:56:53,559 --> 03:56:54,200
Left or right.

3399
03:56:54,200 --> 03:57:01,290
Okay.

3400
03:57:01,290 --> 03:57:01,770
Go.

3401
03:57:01,770 --> 03:57:07,879
Turn back.

3402
03:57:07,879 --> 03:57:08,680
Left or right.

3403
03:57:08,680 --> 03:57:16,649
I love this game.

3404
03:57:16,649 --> 03:57:17,530
It's so fun.

3405
03:57:17,530 --> 03:57:28,110
The left gang is trying to kill you.

3406
03:57:28,110 --> 03:57:29,149
What is this game called?

3407
03:57:29,149 --> 03:57:31,629
It is called Sorcery with an exclamation point.

3408
03:57:31,629 --> 03:57:34,700
There are a few other things called Sorcery, so make sure you...

3409
03:57:34,700 --> 03:57:36,860
It's Steve Jackson's Sorcery.

3410
03:57:36,860 --> 03:57:40,540
This is the tutorial, by the way.

3411
03:57:40,540 --> 03:57:45,319
We're gonna be stuck here for hours.

3412
03:57:46,840 --> 03:57:50,110
All right, it's left.

3413
03:57:50,110 --> 03:57:51,790
You slip through the opening in the left wall.

3414
03:57:51,790 --> 03:57:57,389
The tunnel twists and bends sharply as if carved by a river now long since dried away.

3415
03:57:57,389 --> 03:58:01,389
You lose all sense of which way is which except to keep going forward.

3416
03:58:01,389 --> 03:58:03,399
With a winding seam forks again.

3417
03:58:04,200 --> 03:58:08,670
Another pair of stones are stacked in one corner.

3418
03:58:08,670 --> 03:58:09,950
Another pair of stones.

3419
03:58:09,950 --> 03:58:13,500
Okay.

3420
03:58:13,500 --> 03:58:16,329
Left or right.

3421
03:58:16,329 --> 03:58:32,170
Is there up or down?

3422
03:58:32,170 --> 03:58:33,370
There's only left and right.

3423
03:58:33,370 --> 03:58:36,750
How about face cam?

3424
03:58:36,750 --> 03:58:37,069
All right.

3425
03:58:37,069 --> 03:58:37,790
You've been good.

3426
03:58:37,790 --> 03:58:39,629
You've been good.

3427
03:58:39,629 --> 03:58:42,670
We'll do it for a minute.

3428
03:58:42,670 --> 03:58:52,590
What do we got?

3429
03:58:52,590 --> 03:58:55,129
Still pretty close.

3430
03:58:55,129 --> 03:58:58,520
You can just shave.

3431
03:58:58,520 --> 03:58:59,239
I know.

3432
03:58:59,239 --> 03:59:00,200
I will eventually.

3433
03:59:00,200 --> 03:59:06,600
This is left.

3434
03:59:06,600 --> 03:59:08,540
By a lot.

3435
03:59:08,540 --> 03:59:13,149
All right, let's go.

3436
03:59:13,149 --> 03:59:14,030
You go left.

3437
03:59:14,030 --> 03:59:18,280
The going is suddenly more difficult and you realize that the tunnel is climbing

3438
03:59:18,280 --> 03:59:20,750
at a quite a sharp gradient.

3439
03:59:20,750 --> 03:59:21,790
Little stones.

3440
03:59:21,790 --> 03:59:24,510
Little stones rattle and roll away downwards into the dark.

3441
03:59:24,510 --> 03:59:28,799
At the highest point, the cavern flickers in the torchlight and reaches a split.

3442
03:59:28,799 --> 03:59:32,399
As you enter, two stones roll away down the slope.

3443
03:59:32,399 --> 03:59:33,280
Two stones.

3444
03:59:33,280 --> 03:59:36,059
Two stones.

3445
03:59:36,059 --> 03:59:43,709
Where are we going here?

3446
03:59:43,709 --> 03:59:48,110
All right.

3447
03:59:48,110 --> 03:59:48,510
Last one.

3448
03:59:48,510 --> 03:59:49,629
Then I'm going to start picking.

3449
03:59:49,629 --> 03:59:54,479
Make your choice.

3450
03:59:54,479 --> 04:00:02,379
Yeah, I got to shave bad.

3451
04:00:02,379 --> 04:00:04,680
It's been a long time.

3452
04:00:04,680 --> 04:00:05,559
How long has it been?

3453
04:00:05,559 --> 04:00:07,399
A couple weeks.

3454
04:00:07,399 --> 04:00:08,520
Probably like a week and a half.

3455
04:00:11,850 --> 04:00:12,889
Delay is bad.

3456
04:00:12,889 --> 04:00:14,170
Do I have a delay on the mic?

3457
04:00:14,170 --> 04:00:15,629
Shouldn't be.

3458
04:00:15,629 --> 04:00:21,450
Looks like left gang is winning again.

3459
04:00:21,450 --> 04:00:25,180
Three lefts is just turning around.

3460
04:00:25,180 --> 04:00:25,819
Yeah.

3461
04:00:31,069 --> 04:00:32,350
Hey, don't tell them that.

3462
04:00:32,350 --> 04:00:33,629
They're making their choice.

3463
04:00:33,629 --> 04:00:45,020
It's too close to call, but I think it's going to be left.

3464
04:00:45,020 --> 04:00:55,040
There is a weird delay, by the way.

3465
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:55,600
Yeah.

3466
04:00:55,600 --> 04:00:59,549
There's so many frame drops that hopefully it's been at least watchable.

3467
04:00:59,549 --> 04:01:02,299
Let's go.

3468
04:01:02,299 --> 04:01:08,600
The cave walls crush in close as though the rock is squeezing you to death.

3469
04:01:08,600 --> 04:01:10,920
Your shoulders rub against the walls.

3470
04:01:10,920 --> 04:01:15,600
When you feel certain you can go no further, the tunnel branches once more.

3471
04:01:15,600 --> 04:01:17,680
Two more stones are stacked against the wall.

3472
04:01:29,450 --> 04:01:30,329
I went left again.

3473
04:01:30,329 --> 04:01:34,079
You squeeze into the gap in the left wall.

3474
04:01:34,079 --> 04:01:38,590
You follow the passageway when you hear an echo of whimpering coming up the corridor.

3475
04:01:38,590 --> 04:01:41,600
Your torchlight falls across a frail shape.

3476
04:01:41,600 --> 04:01:44,479
Hiding in the shadows is the young spin girl.

3477
04:01:44,479 --> 04:01:47,200
Stacking stones into hundreds of little towers.

3478
04:01:47,200 --> 04:01:51,079
Traps first.

3479
04:01:51,079 --> 04:01:53,559
You run the torchlight around the walls of the cavern.

3480
04:01:53,559 --> 04:01:55,479
No switches or triggers that you can see.

3481
04:01:55,479 --> 04:01:57,799
The girl watches you with silent fear.

3482
04:01:57,799 --> 04:02:01,280
And then the torchlight falls on a deep scratch in the rock.

3483
04:02:01,280 --> 04:02:02,909
Claw mark.

3484
04:02:02,909 --> 04:02:06,989
Suddenly there is a loud roaring from the mouth of this short cavern.

3485
04:02:06,989 --> 04:02:09,530
The walls begin to shake and crumble.

3486
04:02:09,530 --> 04:02:13,049
The spin stone towers topple and scatter.

3487
04:02:13,049 --> 04:02:17,370
To one side a gap in the rubble begins to open, letting through a mean shaft of light.

3488
04:02:17,370 --> 04:02:23,260
But before you can head for it, the roaring sound is joined by a scream from the spin girl.

3489
04:02:23,260 --> 04:02:26,889
You turn slowly and peer into the gloom back along the tunnel.

3490
04:02:26,889 --> 04:02:28,329
Is there something moving?

3491
04:02:28,329 --> 04:02:29,530
Something coming closer?

3492
04:02:29,530 --> 04:02:34,399
Perhaps the roaring is the wind rushing through the tunnels.

3493
04:02:34,399 --> 04:02:35,520
Something is coming.

3494
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:43,260
You hear the scrabbling sound of claws on rock.

3495
04:02:43,639 --> 04:02:47,159
And the exit from the tunnel is blocked by a dark and looming shape.

3496
04:02:47,159 --> 04:02:49,049
A manticore.

3497
04:02:49,049 --> 04:02:49,930
Huge.

3498
04:02:49,930 --> 04:02:50,889
Terrible.

3499
04:02:50,889 --> 04:02:57,389
It stands between you and the light and it howls in bloody rage.

3500
04:02:57,389 --> 04:02:58,719
Look at the creature.

3501
04:02:58,719 --> 04:02:59,440
Fight the creature.

3502
04:02:59,440 --> 04:03:03,200
Use magic.

3503
04:03:03,200 --> 04:03:06,120
You clear your mind for a spell.

3504
04:03:06,120 --> 04:03:17,260
I thought that was Pog.

3505
04:03:17,260 --> 04:03:18,059
I was like, no way.

3506
04:03:18,059 --> 04:03:23,500
What?

3507
04:03:23,500 --> 04:03:24,059
Strength.

3508
04:03:24,059 --> 04:03:29,770
I don't have fire water.

3509
04:03:29,770 --> 04:03:30,489
Puff.

3510
04:03:30,489 --> 04:03:31,450
Create wind.

3511
04:03:31,450 --> 04:03:38,590
I don't have a gale horn.

3512
04:03:38,590 --> 04:03:39,559
Dumb.

3513
04:03:39,559 --> 04:03:41,079
Cause clumsiness.

3514
04:03:41,079 --> 04:03:46,239
That's a lot of stamina though.

3515
04:03:46,239 --> 04:03:50,829
There's also goes.

3516
04:03:50,829 --> 04:03:51,790
Cause slowness.

3517
04:03:51,790 --> 04:03:53,100
Dopp.

3518
04:03:53,100 --> 04:03:54,139
Open locks and doors.

3519
04:04:01,420 --> 04:04:03,100
There's only huff.

3520
04:04:03,100 --> 04:04:03,659
Not hot.

3521
04:04:03,659 --> 04:04:07,399
No zap.

3522
04:04:07,399 --> 04:04:09,479
This fog summoned darkness.

3523
04:04:13,579 --> 04:04:14,219
Force field.

3524
04:04:16,889 --> 04:04:17,930
What would Dopp do?

3525
04:04:21,149 --> 04:04:22,270
I mean, hold on.

3526
04:04:22,270 --> 04:04:24,270
Let me look at Dopp.

3527
04:04:24,829 --> 04:04:25,389
I'm just curious.

3528
04:04:25,389 --> 04:04:31,629
I know it opens doors, but...

3529
04:04:31,629 --> 04:04:33,709
The spell may be used to open any locked door.

3530
04:04:34,350 --> 04:04:38,110
Casting the spell works directly on the lock tumblers and the door may be opened freely.

3531
04:04:38,750 --> 04:04:41,389
If the door is bolted from the inside, the bolts will be undone.

3532
04:04:42,110 --> 04:04:45,159
The spell will not work on doors sealed by magic.

3533
04:04:45,159 --> 04:04:46,040
Okay.

3534
04:04:46,040 --> 04:04:47,559
So why is it available?

3535
04:04:47,559 --> 04:04:49,159
What can we do there?

3536
04:04:49,159 --> 04:04:56,090
Or I don't cast a spell and I just fight.

3537
04:04:56,090 --> 04:04:57,370
I only have eight stamina.

3538
04:04:58,090 --> 04:05:00,909
I'm gonna try it in rewind.

3539
04:05:00,909 --> 04:05:01,309
I'm curious.

3540
04:05:02,840 --> 04:05:03,559
Dopp.

3541
04:05:03,559 --> 04:05:10,270
You cast a spell and the rock wall behind the manticore shifts and tumbles,

3542
04:05:10,270 --> 04:05:16,120
opening a wider passage through which you see the daylight from the crack in the ceiling above.

3543
04:05:16,120 --> 04:05:19,319
One of the tumbling rocks hits the manticore's sting,

3544
04:05:19,319 --> 04:05:21,690
which was swinging through the air towards you.

3545
04:05:21,690 --> 04:05:24,190
A lucky escape.

3546
04:05:24,190 --> 04:05:24,510
What?

3547
04:05:24,510 --> 04:05:28,010
Did I get out?

3548
04:05:28,010 --> 04:05:29,850
Wait, draw my sword and cast another spell.

3549
04:05:29,850 --> 04:05:30,670
Hold on.

3550
04:05:30,670 --> 04:05:34,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3551
04:05:34,639 --> 04:05:35,280
Can I get out?

3552
04:05:36,780 --> 04:05:38,059
Whoa, there's new things.

3553
04:05:38,059 --> 04:05:38,459
Hold on.

3554
04:05:39,559 --> 04:05:39,959
Yap.

3555
04:05:40,520 --> 04:05:41,479
Oh, I can't talk.

3556
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:43,799
I can talk to the manticore?

3557
04:05:44,360 --> 04:05:44,680
What?

3558
04:05:47,870 --> 04:05:48,510
Yob.

3559
04:05:48,510 --> 04:05:49,389
Summon a...

3560
04:05:49,389 --> 04:05:51,469
Oh, you shitting me.

3561
04:05:52,110 --> 04:05:53,149
Are you shitting me?

3562
04:05:53,149 --> 04:05:54,190
Should I summon a giant?

3563
04:05:55,930 --> 04:05:56,569
That's cool.

3564
04:05:57,290 --> 04:05:58,090
That's cool.

3565
04:05:58,090 --> 04:05:59,209
I wonder how cool this would be.

3566
04:06:02,110 --> 04:06:02,430
Hold on.

3567
04:06:02,430 --> 04:06:03,149
What else is there?

3568
04:06:07,579 --> 04:06:09,020
I can cast fireball.

3569
04:06:09,020 --> 04:06:13,760
I can go up.

3570
04:06:13,760 --> 04:06:14,719
Summon a goblin.

3571
04:06:16,079 --> 04:06:19,719
This goblin is going to get instantly killed, I think.

3572
04:06:21,239 --> 04:06:23,000
Giant versus the manticore?

3573
04:06:23,000 --> 04:06:27,260
There's more.

3574
04:06:28,829 --> 04:06:29,149
Mud.

3575
04:06:29,950 --> 04:06:30,879
Look at that.

3576
04:06:31,600 --> 04:06:32,399
Would you look at that?

3577
04:06:33,120 --> 04:06:37,690
Are you telling me that I have this ability to do this now?

3578
04:06:38,250 --> 04:06:40,250
I can suck this motherfucker down into the earth.

3579
04:06:40,889 --> 04:06:44,700
All right.

3580
04:06:44,700 --> 04:06:46,780
Can we just see what Gob does and rewind?

3581
04:06:47,340 --> 04:06:48,299
Let me see.

3582
04:06:48,299 --> 04:06:48,940
I'm curious.

3583
04:06:48,940 --> 04:06:49,420
Let's do it.

3584
04:06:52,489 --> 04:06:55,690
You toss down one of your goblin teeth and quickly cast the spell.

3585
04:06:55,690 --> 04:06:59,530
With a cloud of smoke, a furious goblin warrior appears,

3586
04:06:59,530 --> 04:07:04,010
making the spin girl shriek with fear.

3587
04:07:04,010 --> 04:07:05,610
But he is under your control,

3588
04:07:05,610 --> 04:07:08,250
and you direct him straight towards the manticore.

3589
04:07:08,250 --> 04:07:11,979
The little goblin fights valiantly,

3590
04:07:11,979 --> 04:07:16,079
ducking nimbly between and around the swings of the gigantic stinging tail.

3591
04:07:16,079 --> 04:07:19,440
But ultimately, he is no match for the vicious beast.

3592
04:07:19,440 --> 04:07:24,399
One strong swoop of a claw and his little body is broken in two.

3593
04:07:24,399 --> 04:07:26,430
Do it again!

3594
04:07:26,430 --> 04:07:28,110
You throw down another goblin tooth.

3595
04:07:28,110 --> 04:07:30,430
This one fares a little better than the first.

3596
04:07:30,430 --> 04:07:32,510
Perhaps each learns from the last.

3597
04:07:32,510 --> 04:07:37,239
He lands a few good strikes and then is crushed beneath a gigantic paw.

3598
04:07:37,239 --> 04:07:41,340
Then the beast is on top of you, and there is no more time for spellcasting.

3599
04:07:41,340 --> 04:07:42,620
Oh, god damn it.

3600
04:07:42,620 --> 04:07:47,149
They did two damage.

3601
04:07:47,149 --> 04:07:49,309
Go back, go back, go back, go back.

3602
04:07:49,309 --> 04:07:51,069
I'm using one of mine, one of my things.

3603
04:07:51,069 --> 04:07:54,280
I'm using one of my things.

3604
04:07:54,280 --> 04:08:02,909
Okay, it was Dopp.

3605
04:08:02,909 --> 04:08:05,709
But should I save the gob, the giant tooth?

3606
04:08:05,709 --> 04:08:06,510
I only have one.

3607
04:08:06,510 --> 04:08:16,350
Something else that you guys need to remember.

3608
04:08:16,350 --> 04:08:31,180
I, these are, these are my items and I carry them on through the rest of the game.

3609
04:08:31,180 --> 04:08:35,500
So if I use this giant's tooth, I might not actually be able to get another one.

3610
04:08:35,500 --> 04:08:36,459
I don't know.

3611
04:08:36,459 --> 04:08:37,739
I forget how rare these are.

3612
04:08:37,739 --> 04:08:39,309
I have two giant, let me hold on.

3613
04:08:39,309 --> 04:08:49,020
How many teeth do I have?

3614
04:08:49,020 --> 04:08:49,979
Two beeswax.

3615
04:08:50,620 --> 04:08:53,020
I have a ton of goblin teeth.

3616
04:08:53,020 --> 04:08:54,219
They're just so useless though.

3617
04:08:54,860 --> 04:08:55,420
They're funny.

3618
04:08:56,430 --> 04:08:57,469
Sometimes they can help a lot.

3619
04:08:57,469 --> 04:09:00,030
All right, I only have one pouch of sand.

3620
04:09:00,030 --> 04:09:03,000
I have one giant's tooth, not two.

3621
04:09:03,000 --> 04:09:04,760
Do the mud?

3622
04:09:11,229 --> 04:09:13,469
You're never going to be able to beat the manticore in a fight one on one.

3623
04:09:13,469 --> 04:09:17,319
Actually, it's going to be really hard.

3624
04:09:17,319 --> 04:09:18,280
You got to use yap.

3625
04:09:18,280 --> 04:09:20,329
I don't have the item.

3626
04:09:20,329 --> 04:09:20,969
I didn't get it.

3627
04:09:26,409 --> 04:09:29,209
Let's try, let's try mud.

3628
04:09:29,209 --> 04:09:33,840
I'm going to try mud.

3629
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:34,959
I mean, I stole it.

3630
04:09:34,959 --> 04:09:35,760
Might as well try it.

3631
04:09:39,920 --> 04:09:43,079
Or that's too expensive.

3632
04:09:45,159 --> 04:09:46,760
It's just like fucking Resident Evil, man.

3633
04:09:46,760 --> 04:09:48,440
I don't want to lose all my items.

3634
04:09:48,440 --> 04:09:56,159
Let's do it.

3635
04:09:56,159 --> 04:10:00,479
You pull out your pouch of sand and quickly toss it across the floor, raising the spell.

3636
04:10:01,120 --> 04:10:03,280
The floor begins to bubble and bend.

3637
04:10:03,280 --> 04:10:05,200
And then suddenly where there had been solid stone,

3638
04:10:05,200 --> 04:10:11,100
there is now a sucking, grasping pool of quicksand right beneath the manticore's feet.

3639
04:10:11,100 --> 04:10:15,260
Before it can react, its front paws are being dragged below ground.

3640
04:10:15,260 --> 04:10:18,969
The creature beats its wings in a furious panic.

3641
04:10:18,969 --> 04:10:25,290
And its sting lashes and bashes at the wall as it struggles and tries wildly to free itself.

3642
04:10:25,290 --> 04:10:27,129
The sting is lancing towards you.

3643
04:10:27,129 --> 04:10:28,440
Oh, fuck.

3644
04:10:28,440 --> 04:10:29,719
Dodge left or dodge right?

3645
04:10:29,719 --> 04:10:31,079
Left gang or right gang?

3646
04:10:31,079 --> 04:10:32,329
Which one?

3647
04:10:32,329 --> 04:10:36,729
This is where the different gangs really need to shine here.

3648
04:10:36,809 --> 04:11:07,340
Okay, okay, okay.

3649
04:11:08,639 --> 04:11:09,680
It's running away.

3650
04:11:09,680 --> 04:11:11,680
It's actually running away right now.

3651
04:11:11,680 --> 04:11:14,989
This is what we're up against.

3652
04:11:14,989 --> 04:11:17,950
Do you understand how important this is?

3653
04:11:17,950 --> 04:11:19,549
Currently being sucked into the ground.

3654
04:11:25,870 --> 04:11:28,030
The manticore has about twice as much stamina as me,

3655
04:11:28,030 --> 04:11:36,510
so fighting it head on actually really sucks.

3656
04:11:36,510 --> 04:11:37,309
Dodge left.

3657
04:11:37,309 --> 04:11:42,760
You dodge left as the sting swings past you to the right.

3658
04:11:42,760 --> 04:11:43,719
You laugh.

3659
04:11:43,719 --> 04:11:45,479
A lucky escape indeed.

3660
04:11:45,479 --> 04:11:49,079
The terrible tug of war continues, but the spell is beginning to wear off.

3661
04:11:49,079 --> 04:11:51,319
And the manticore is such a large beast

3662
04:11:51,319 --> 04:11:53,799
that the quicksand is not enough to contain it.

3663
04:11:53,799 --> 04:11:58,840
However, it has worn itself out considerably from the struggle.

3664
04:11:58,840 --> 04:12:01,479
The manticore roars, making the walls of the chamber shake,

3665
04:12:01,479 --> 04:12:07,420
but listening closely, you can hear a note of fear in its too human voice.

3666
04:12:07,420 --> 04:12:11,530
It is still a beast of ferocious strength, but you have weakened it.

3667
04:12:11,530 --> 04:12:14,569
You'll have to make this next and final spell matter

3668
04:12:14,569 --> 04:12:16,409
or take it to task with your sword.

3669
04:12:26,360 --> 04:12:27,639
Wait, I can do six.

3670
04:12:32,250 --> 04:12:39,799
I can also do sap, which is depression.

3671
04:12:39,799 --> 04:12:41,239
Law, no way.

3672
04:12:41,239 --> 04:12:42,940
Will this work?

3673
04:12:42,940 --> 04:12:43,899
He's weak.

3674
04:12:43,899 --> 04:12:44,620
He's weakened.

3675
04:12:44,620 --> 04:12:45,819
Can I control his mind?

3676
04:12:54,620 --> 04:12:55,899
I could throw a grenade if I had one.

3677
04:12:59,610 --> 04:13:02,090
Zap, zip, teleport.

3678
04:13:02,090 --> 04:13:03,209
I could probably teleport out.

3679
04:13:08,379 --> 04:13:11,360
Law probably won't work.

3680
04:13:11,360 --> 04:13:15,520
Are manticores intelligent creatures?

3681
04:13:15,520 --> 04:13:16,799
Try law.

3682
04:13:16,799 --> 04:13:18,079
I got one more rewind, guys.

3683
04:13:18,639 --> 04:13:19,760
I have like no health either.

3684
04:13:24,780 --> 04:13:27,020
You cast the spell heart in your mouth.

3685
04:13:27,579 --> 04:13:30,540
This enchantment only works on unintelligent creatures.

3686
04:13:30,540 --> 04:13:32,299
But is the manticore intelligent?

3687
04:13:32,299 --> 04:13:36,250
Or is it a foul beast of base urges and rage?

3688
04:13:36,250 --> 04:13:41,450
You step back, sword drawn, ready in case the spell should fail.

3689
04:13:41,450 --> 04:13:46,430
For a moment, the manticore stops quite still.

3690
04:13:46,430 --> 04:13:48,520
Its sting lowers to the floor.

3691
04:13:48,520 --> 04:13:51,739
Its expression becomes one of dark confusion.

3692
04:13:51,739 --> 04:13:58,750
The great wings flutter and flap.

3693
04:13:58,750 --> 04:14:03,149
Shit!

3694
04:14:03,149 --> 04:14:04,350
Oh, no.

3695
04:14:04,350 --> 04:14:06,409
Then a moment later, it seems to wake once more.

3696
04:14:06,409 --> 04:14:08,409
The great sting rises in the creature's bellows,

3697
04:14:08,409 --> 04:14:11,209
a howling roar of rage and defiance.

3698
04:14:11,209 --> 04:14:15,610
Those old man's eyes glower at you with the hatred of all the ages.

3699
04:14:15,610 --> 04:14:16,729
Your spell has failed.

3700
04:14:16,729 --> 04:14:17,530
You're out of time.

3701
04:14:17,530 --> 04:14:23,200
You must fight the creature.

3702
04:14:23,200 --> 04:14:24,000
Oh!

3703
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:37,930
The fearsome creature paces forward, teeth barred.

3704
04:14:37,930 --> 04:14:41,399
At the last moment, the manticore pounces all claws off the ground

3705
04:14:41,399 --> 04:14:44,280
and bared to plunge into your flesh.

3706
04:14:44,280 --> 04:14:49,579
It takes you by surprise and wide open, knocking you painfully back.

3707
04:14:49,579 --> 04:14:51,979
Spin Girl screams out an alarm.

3708
04:14:51,979 --> 04:14:57,799
The Spin Girl screams.

3709
04:14:57,799 --> 04:15:02,489
Only then do you see the giant sting plunging down towards your forehead.

3710
04:15:02,489 --> 04:15:06,649
In your weakened state, you are too slow to roll out of the way.

3711
04:15:06,649 --> 04:15:11,159
The sting lands with the force of a hammer blow piercing your skull.

3712
04:15:11,159 --> 04:15:19,100
The last thing you feel is the pumping of burning poison as it enters your brain.

3713
04:15:19,100 --> 04:15:21,440
What's my fate?

3714
04:15:21,440 --> 04:15:24,000
You've been killed in combat.

3715
04:15:24,000 --> 04:15:30,200
Your adventure is at an end.

3716
04:15:30,200 --> 04:15:32,440
Where the fucking ape when I needed him?

3717
04:15:32,440 --> 04:15:34,989
That's the first death.

3718
04:15:34,989 --> 04:15:39,100
It's fine.

3719
04:15:39,100 --> 04:15:39,500
All right.

3720
04:15:39,500 --> 04:15:41,500
We're going to layer the manticore.

3721
04:15:41,500 --> 04:15:42,059
We're going.

3722
04:15:42,059 --> 04:15:42,700
Let's go.

3723
04:15:42,700 --> 04:15:46,729
It's all right.

3724
04:15:46,729 --> 04:15:47,819
Okay.

3725
04:15:47,819 --> 04:16:01,200
This time, we're going to do Dopp.

3726
04:16:01,200 --> 04:16:04,200
Dopp lets us continue the rest.

3727
04:16:04,200 --> 04:16:05,559
Although Doze might do it, too.

3728
04:16:05,559 --> 04:16:07,440
Does anything cost no stamina?

3729
04:16:07,440 --> 04:16:12,090
Dopp is a good start, always, yeah.

3730
04:16:12,090 --> 04:16:12,569
Okay.

3731
04:16:12,569 --> 04:16:14,909
Now let's pull it back up.

3732
04:16:14,909 --> 04:16:20,750
Time for the giant.

3733
04:16:20,750 --> 04:16:21,469
I wish I had.

3734
04:16:22,809 --> 04:16:23,850
Should I go for it?

3735
04:16:23,850 --> 04:16:25,370
Is it time to bring out the giant?

3736
04:16:25,370 --> 04:16:26,569
But I want to keep the giant.

3737
04:16:26,569 --> 04:16:37,930
What if the giant could help somewhere else?

3738
04:16:37,930 --> 04:16:40,250
Mud was, I think mud was good.

3739
04:16:40,250 --> 04:16:41,049
We're doing mud.

3740
04:16:43,709 --> 04:16:44,590
Duck in the sand.

3741
04:16:44,590 --> 04:16:48,639
It was dodge left.

3742
04:16:48,639 --> 04:16:51,120
Swings past the right.

3743
04:16:51,120 --> 04:16:52,079
Okay.

3744
04:16:52,079 --> 04:16:58,680
Let's go.

3745
04:16:58,680 --> 04:16:59,959
This is the last chance.

3746
04:16:59,959 --> 04:17:06,059
Here we just, I mean, try to zap.

3747
04:17:06,059 --> 04:17:07,180
I could do six, too.

3748
04:17:07,180 --> 04:17:07,979
I could confuse.

3749
04:17:07,979 --> 04:17:08,379
Yeah.

3750
04:17:08,379 --> 04:17:11,879
Or sap.

3751
04:17:11,879 --> 04:17:16,920
Depression.

3752
04:17:16,920 --> 04:17:19,319
Can a manticore become depressed?

3753
04:17:19,319 --> 04:17:22,799
It's already afraid.

3754
04:17:22,799 --> 04:17:23,440
Pull up the six.

3755
04:17:23,440 --> 04:17:23,600
All right.

3756
04:17:23,600 --> 04:17:24,239
We're going to do clones.

3757
04:17:24,239 --> 04:17:25,040
Let's do it.

3758
04:17:25,040 --> 04:17:26,239
Whatever happens, happens.

3759
04:17:26,239 --> 04:17:29,309
You cast a spell, and as you lower your hand,

3760
04:17:29,309 --> 04:17:30,590
the spin girl gasps.

3761
04:17:30,590 --> 04:17:33,549
Three identical figures have stepped out from behind you

3762
04:17:33,549 --> 04:17:35,389
to the left and two more to the right,

3763
04:17:35,389 --> 04:17:37,229
each making the same magical gesture.

3764
04:17:38,430 --> 04:17:41,049
The manticore opens its spittle fleck jaws

3765
04:17:41,049 --> 04:17:42,889
and howls at all six of you.

3766
04:17:42,889 --> 04:17:43,389
What?

3767
04:17:46,250 --> 04:17:47,209
You can't even see.

3768
04:17:49,690 --> 04:17:50,889
All six of us.

3769
04:17:54,829 --> 04:17:57,149
Then it pauses and sniffs the air.

3770
04:17:57,870 --> 04:18:00,110
Of course, your clones have no scent.

3771
04:18:00,110 --> 04:18:03,149
However, you still have six times the attack power

3772
04:18:03,149 --> 04:18:06,030
and the monster will be forced to move slowly

3773
04:18:06,030 --> 04:18:08,190
to ensure it hits its target.

3774
04:18:08,190 --> 04:18:11,209
You draw your sword and close on the beast,

3775
04:18:11,209 --> 04:18:13,290
eyes focused tightly on the terrible sting,

3776
04:18:13,290 --> 04:18:16,159
but at least you have caused it some injury already.

3777
04:18:16,159 --> 04:18:16,559
All right.

3778
04:18:16,559 --> 04:18:21,040
I have six times the attack power.

3779
04:18:21,040 --> 04:18:23,229
Um, all right.

3780
04:18:23,229 --> 04:18:23,629
Defend.

3781
04:18:24,270 --> 04:18:24,670
Yep.

3782
04:18:24,670 --> 04:18:25,229
Good start.

3783
04:18:25,229 --> 04:18:25,709
Good start.

3784
04:18:25,709 --> 04:18:26,030
Good start.

3785
04:18:26,030 --> 04:18:26,430
Good start.

3786
04:18:26,430 --> 04:18:29,690
I'm all right.

3787
04:18:29,690 --> 04:18:32,250
The fearsome creature paces forward, teeth bared.

3788
04:18:32,250 --> 04:18:34,889
You and your clones drop back, raising your guard,

3789
04:18:34,889 --> 04:18:36,649
hoping the beast will wear itself out.

3790
04:18:36,649 --> 04:18:38,620
At the last moment, the manticore pounces,

3791
04:18:38,620 --> 04:18:42,219
all claws off the ground and bear to plunge into your flesh.

3792
04:18:42,219 --> 04:18:44,219
You brace yourself as it comes down and leap aside

3793
04:18:44,219 --> 04:18:46,940
at the last moment, claws raking your skin.

3794
04:18:46,940 --> 04:18:51,100
For a moment, it is close enough to smell its warm, fetid breath.

3795
04:18:51,100 --> 04:18:53,469
Okay, that was all in.

3796
04:18:53,469 --> 04:18:56,139
We're going to go like two.

3797
04:18:56,139 --> 04:18:57,100
Fuck you.

3798
04:18:57,100 --> 04:18:58,860
Oh my God, that's bad.

3799
04:18:58,860 --> 04:18:59,360
What?

3800
04:19:00,459 --> 04:19:02,219
Oh, come on, dude.

3801
04:19:02,219 --> 04:19:10,190
Full blast.

3802
04:19:10,750 --> 04:19:11,149
There it is.

3803
04:19:11,149 --> 04:19:11,549
There it is.

3804
04:19:12,360 --> 04:19:12,680
We have...

3805
04:19:13,239 --> 04:19:14,440
Look at how much damage we're doing,

3806
04:19:14,440 --> 04:19:15,959
and I have six times the attack power.

3807
04:19:15,959 --> 04:19:16,600
Really?

3808
04:19:16,600 --> 04:19:21,709
Okay.

3809
04:19:21,709 --> 04:19:24,940
The creature snarls and snaps at jaws.

3810
04:19:24,940 --> 04:19:27,100
You must finish this monster before it finishes you.

3811
04:19:27,100 --> 04:19:30,120
With the rock wall at your back, you have no way to hide,

3812
04:19:30,120 --> 04:19:31,799
but a perfect platform to spring forward.

3813
04:19:31,799 --> 04:19:34,760
You and your clones race at the manticore,

3814
04:19:34,760 --> 04:19:36,780
catching it a light blow.

3815
04:19:36,780 --> 04:19:37,899
The beast growls at you.

3816
04:19:37,899 --> 04:19:39,260
The walls shiver with its fury.

3817
04:19:39,260 --> 04:19:41,420
The spin girl edges nearer,

3818
04:19:41,420 --> 04:19:43,899
as if thinking of scratching the creature with her claws.

3819
04:19:44,540 --> 04:19:45,739
It's scared.

3820
04:19:45,739 --> 04:19:46,860
She whispers to you.

3821
04:19:46,860 --> 04:19:49,020
You might not believe me, but you've scared it.

3822
04:19:49,020 --> 04:19:51,420
Going again.

3823
04:19:51,420 --> 04:19:52,059
Oh, got it.

3824
04:19:53,180 --> 04:19:54,059
Beautiful.

3825
04:19:54,059 --> 04:19:57,639
Standing firm, you, along with your copies,

3826
04:19:57,639 --> 04:19:59,399
swing a mighty stroke against the monster,

3827
04:19:59,399 --> 04:20:02,280
slipping a little strike past the manticore's outstretched claws.

3828
04:20:02,280 --> 04:20:05,069
The creature crashes against a wall.

3829
04:20:05,069 --> 04:20:05,569
Smash.

3830
04:20:06,110 --> 04:20:08,110
Rock dust pours onto its back,

3831
04:20:08,110 --> 04:20:10,430
but as it tries to shake itself, it stumbles.

3832
04:20:11,149 --> 04:20:12,590
You can hardly dare to hope.

3833
04:20:12,590 --> 04:20:14,110
The foul beast is weakening.

3834
04:20:15,290 --> 04:20:16,569
All right, I gotta be careful.

3835
04:20:16,569 --> 04:20:20,590
Is a big one coming?

3836
04:20:20,590 --> 04:20:21,090
I don't know.

3837
04:20:23,100 --> 04:20:25,340
What was the last thing, what was the last thing he did?

3838
04:20:25,340 --> 04:20:28,200
It's like 2.4?

3839
04:20:28,200 --> 04:20:29,930
I think I have to defend here.

3840
04:20:30,489 --> 04:20:31,370
Yep, okay.

3841
04:20:31,370 --> 04:20:32,569
Fuck, I'm gonna die.

3842
04:20:32,569 --> 04:20:39,309
You can almost smell the creature growing enraged

3843
04:20:39,309 --> 04:20:41,610
and drop quickly away.

3844
04:20:41,610 --> 04:20:44,329
The manticore makes a nasty swipe with its fearsome claws,

3845
04:20:44,329 --> 04:20:48,139
but you and your clones duck and escape real injury.

3846
04:20:48,139 --> 04:20:49,340
You are gasping for breath.

3847
04:20:49,340 --> 04:20:50,700
The creature's relentless assault.

3848
04:20:50,700 --> 04:20:53,500
Its sheer rage is almost too much for you to take.

3849
04:20:53,500 --> 04:20:55,690
The manticore chomps and grinds its teeth,

3850
04:20:55,690 --> 04:20:58,590
its expression an ugly frown.

3851
04:20:58,590 --> 04:21:00,510
All in.

3852
04:21:00,510 --> 04:21:01,319
Good.

3853
04:21:01,319 --> 04:21:03,530
That's another three.

3854
04:21:03,530 --> 04:21:04,489
I'm going all in again.

3855
04:21:06,110 --> 04:21:06,909
In the darkness of the cave,

3856
04:21:06,909 --> 04:21:08,350
it's hard to read the monster's intentions,

3857
04:21:08,350 --> 04:21:10,010
but you cannot wait forever.

3858
04:21:10,010 --> 04:21:12,090
Dropping your weight, you and your copies

3859
04:21:12,090 --> 04:21:13,930
chop a heavy swing at the vile beast,

3860
04:21:13,930 --> 04:21:16,559
catching the manticore, passing cut again.

3861
04:21:16,559 --> 04:21:18,520
Right?

3862
04:21:18,520 --> 04:21:19,239
I think so, right?

3863
04:21:19,239 --> 04:21:21,159
Because he's used his whole bar.

3864
04:21:21,159 --> 04:21:21,959
I'm going in again.

3865
04:21:21,959 --> 04:21:24,590
I'm gonna, am I gonna die?

3866
04:21:24,590 --> 04:21:25,469
I have to do it.

3867
04:21:25,469 --> 04:21:25,950
I have to.

3868
04:21:26,670 --> 04:21:27,149
I'm dead.

3869
04:21:34,799 --> 04:21:36,239
Go again, go again, go again, go again.

3870
04:21:36,239 --> 04:21:44,479
Try again, try again, try again.

3871
04:21:44,479 --> 04:21:48,489
Okay, we're gonna go in just a little bit at like a three.

3872
04:21:48,489 --> 04:21:49,610
Fucking god damn it.

3873
04:21:49,610 --> 04:21:56,590
Try again, try again, try again, try again, try again.

3874
04:21:56,590 --> 04:21:57,549
All right, stop, stop, stop.

3875
04:21:57,549 --> 04:22:00,829
His guy, his bar is so much higher than mine.

3876
04:22:00,829 --> 04:22:02,270
All in again.

3877
04:22:02,270 --> 04:22:03,719
Just die, just die, whatever.

3878
04:22:03,719 --> 04:22:04,200
Fuck.

3879
04:22:04,200 --> 04:22:05,079
All right, I have to reset.

3880
04:22:05,079 --> 04:22:07,610
Reset, reset, just kill me.

3881
04:22:07,610 --> 04:22:08,729
All right, start over, start over.

3882
04:22:08,729 --> 04:22:11,659
I have, why did I spend all my health on?

3883
04:22:11,659 --> 04:22:13,659
I was doing, I did too many spells throughout the whole game.

3884
04:22:13,659 --> 04:22:14,620
All right, hold on.

3885
04:22:14,620 --> 04:22:18,829
I can't overpower this for a half to take this first hit.

3886
04:22:18,829 --> 04:22:28,040
Okay, now it's, I gotta go in at least at a seven.

3887
04:22:28,040 --> 04:22:29,079
Wow, that was good.

3888
04:22:29,079 --> 04:22:36,760
Okay, okay, now I think I can do it again.

3889
04:22:36,760 --> 04:22:41,850
This is 4.7, all in again.

3890
04:22:41,850 --> 04:22:44,250
All right, this is huge, actually.

3891
04:22:44,250 --> 04:22:45,129
That was actually a big deal.

3892
04:22:45,129 --> 04:22:48,319
Now I can, I'm gonna take a, I'm gonna defend.

3893
04:22:48,319 --> 04:22:50,489
Wait, you've scared it, right?

3894
04:22:50,489 --> 04:22:51,129
It's scared.

3895
04:22:51,129 --> 04:22:55,479
You might not believe me, but you've scared it.

3896
04:22:55,479 --> 04:22:59,370
I don't, I think it's gonna come in with like a one or two.

3897
04:22:59,370 --> 04:23:00,090
I don't know.

3898
04:23:00,090 --> 04:23:03,049
Defend, defend, defend.

3899
04:23:03,049 --> 04:23:07,549
Don't believe, don't believe.

3900
04:23:07,549 --> 04:23:12,350
Isn't it gonna be a little bit?

3901
04:23:12,350 --> 04:23:19,149
I fucking told you guys, I told you, I told you.

3902
04:23:19,149 --> 04:23:25,979
Now I have to defend again, okay?

3903
04:23:25,979 --> 04:23:28,219
Now we go in at like a five or a six.

3904
04:23:29,280 --> 04:23:32,620
Six, just to be sure, yep.

3905
04:23:32,620 --> 04:23:36,120
All right, I gotta do one more all in.

3906
04:23:36,120 --> 04:23:38,889
Grinds its teeth, expression ugly frown.

3907
04:23:38,889 --> 04:23:48,329
Does it have enough to do like six or seven?

3908
04:23:48,329 --> 04:23:49,930
God fucking damn it.

3909
04:23:49,930 --> 04:23:52,889
No, I'm so dead again.

3910
04:23:52,889 --> 04:23:55,370
The monster rears up and in its back legs, it fills the room.

3911
04:23:55,370 --> 04:23:55,850
I'm dead.

3912
04:23:57,049 --> 04:24:02,940
Oh, the manticore screams and howls

3913
04:24:02,940 --> 04:24:05,020
in a voice that is almost human and is dying.

3914
04:24:05,020 --> 04:24:07,739
Slowly, furiously, but nonetheless, it weakens.

3915
04:24:07,739 --> 04:24:09,120
I have to go in.

3916
04:24:13,899 --> 04:24:15,100
You fucked me up.

3917
04:24:15,100 --> 04:24:16,219
You guys fucked me up.

3918
04:24:16,219 --> 04:24:17,260
You guys fucked me up.

3919
04:24:17,260 --> 04:24:18,139
You guys fucked me up.

3920
04:24:20,270 --> 04:24:21,389
You guys fucked me up.

3921
04:24:21,389 --> 04:24:24,030
Okay, when she says it's scared, I'm going in.

3922
04:24:28,200 --> 04:24:29,159
Good, that's a four.

3923
04:24:30,780 --> 04:24:33,850
Again, good.

3924
04:24:35,200 --> 04:24:36,239
You've scared it again.

3925
04:24:42,350 --> 04:24:45,629
All right, now we defend.

3926
04:24:45,629 --> 04:24:47,690
Yep, we're gonna make it out.

3927
04:24:47,690 --> 04:24:48,090
This is it.

3928
04:24:48,090 --> 04:24:52,700
This is it right here, all in.

3929
04:24:52,700 --> 04:24:55,659
All right, literally have to hit it one more time,

3930
04:24:55,659 --> 04:24:56,700
but I'm gonna defend.

3931
04:24:56,700 --> 04:24:57,579
Should I?

3932
04:24:57,579 --> 04:24:58,700
Yep, good call.

3933
04:24:59,260 --> 04:25:01,600
Now we go all in.

3934
04:25:01,600 --> 04:25:03,260
See you later.

3935
04:25:03,260 --> 04:25:11,229
Goodbye, see you later.

3936
04:25:11,229 --> 04:25:15,069
The manticore laughs at you with a human expression of twisted joy.

3937
04:25:15,069 --> 04:25:17,149
You risk an attack of racing across the stone,

3938
04:25:17,149 --> 04:25:18,590
you and your five copies.

3939
04:25:19,790 --> 04:25:21,360
They didn't do anything.

3940
04:25:21,360 --> 04:25:25,049
Would I have done one damage?

3941
04:25:25,049 --> 04:25:28,700
Your sword blade seems almost to be possessed.

3942
04:25:28,700 --> 04:25:31,500
It finds its way past the manticore's sweeping claws

3943
04:25:31,500 --> 04:25:36,459
through its thick hide and down into its ancient, cruel heart.

3944
04:25:36,459 --> 04:25:41,120
For a moment, it howls loud enough to make the walls shake,

3945
04:25:41,120 --> 04:25:42,879
and then everything falls very quiet.

3946
04:25:42,879 --> 04:25:46,120
I'm almost dead.

3947
04:25:46,120 --> 04:25:50,649
The only noise in the chamber is the hammering of your heart

3948
04:25:50,649 --> 04:25:54,520
and the quiet breathing of the spin girl.

3949
04:25:54,520 --> 04:25:56,809
Thank you, the spin girl murmurs.

3950
04:25:57,370 --> 04:26:00,540
Then tugging at your arm, this way,

3951
04:26:00,540 --> 04:26:05,500
she leads you towards the light through the gap made by your dop spell

3952
04:26:05,500 --> 04:26:07,979
to the pool of sunlight in the first cavern.

3953
04:26:07,979 --> 04:26:08,860
Oh, that's good.

3954
04:26:08,860 --> 04:26:16,670
You wave the torch, hoping to attract attention.

3955
04:26:16,670 --> 04:26:19,559
Tell the girl to call up.

3956
04:26:19,559 --> 04:26:21,920
Girl, call to your father.

3957
04:26:21,920 --> 04:26:27,000
The spin child nods mutely, then balls at the top of her lungs.

3958
04:26:27,000 --> 04:26:29,370
Proceus, I'm here.

3959
04:26:30,250 --> 04:26:34,649
Then something drops down, a rope with a basket on the end.

3960
04:26:34,649 --> 04:26:36,010
The girl first.

3961
04:26:36,010 --> 04:26:40,840
Calls a voice from above, Proceus.

3962
04:26:40,840 --> 04:26:42,120
No, I come up first.

3963
04:26:43,879 --> 04:26:45,559
No, I come up first.

3964
04:26:45,559 --> 04:26:48,319
You call back, stepping into the basket.

3965
04:26:48,319 --> 04:26:50,110
The rope doesn't move.

3966
04:26:50,110 --> 04:26:51,440
The girl.

3967
04:26:51,440 --> 04:26:53,360
The girl comes first.

3968
04:26:53,360 --> 04:27:00,399
I ain't moving.

3969
04:27:00,399 --> 04:27:03,020
No, you call back quite calmly.

3970
04:27:03,020 --> 04:27:06,139
Once I'm up, there's nothing to stop you rescuing her.

3971
04:27:06,139 --> 04:27:09,629
If we're both to be rescued, you'll have to rescue me first.

3972
04:27:09,629 --> 04:27:12,510
A minute passes.

3973
04:27:12,510 --> 04:27:14,670
Presumably, the spins are talking it through.

3974
04:27:14,670 --> 04:27:18,250
The girl is looking at you, eyes wide with fear.

3975
04:27:23,719 --> 04:27:25,079
Recycle joke, Andy.

3976
04:27:25,079 --> 04:27:26,360
Come on, it's funny.

3977
04:27:29,799 --> 04:27:33,340
All right, swap places with the girl.

3978
04:27:33,340 --> 04:27:36,219
Her filmed eyes reflect the ordeal she has been through,

3979
04:27:36,219 --> 04:27:40,799
alone down here for so long, and your cold heart melts.

3980
04:27:40,799 --> 04:27:44,270
Don't let them leave me.

3981
04:27:44,270 --> 04:27:47,930
You whisper to her as you step out of the basket and lift her in.

3982
04:27:47,930 --> 04:27:49,850
I won't, she promises.

3983
04:27:49,850 --> 04:27:52,719
You cup your mouth and shout upwards.

3984
04:27:52,719 --> 04:27:53,840
Haul away!

3985
04:27:53,840 --> 04:27:56,799
The spins give a great cry and begin to pull,

3986
04:27:56,799 --> 04:28:00,559
and the basket starts to slowly rise, spinning as it goes.

3987
04:28:00,559 --> 04:28:03,440
The girl waves to you as she disappears up into the sunlight,

3988
04:28:03,440 --> 04:28:05,159
and she is gone.

3989
04:28:05,159 --> 04:28:10,959
A minute passes.

3990
04:28:10,959 --> 04:28:14,590
Nothing.

3991
04:28:14,590 --> 04:28:15,229
Wait.

3992
04:28:15,229 --> 04:28:17,549
Another minute.

3993
04:28:17,549 --> 04:28:18,920
Still nothing.

3994
04:28:18,920 --> 04:28:21,799
No sign of sound or movement from above.

3995
04:28:21,799 --> 04:28:25,399
That treacherous cur, Proceus, has betrayed you clearly.

3996
04:28:25,399 --> 04:28:29,500
The tunnel echoes very slightly.

3997
04:28:29,500 --> 04:28:31,020
A noise from the depths.

3998
04:28:31,020 --> 04:28:33,760
Perhaps the manticore was not alone.

3999
04:28:33,760 --> 04:28:40,940
Someone just said, you stupid bastard.

4000
04:28:40,940 --> 04:28:49,309
You wait a little longer, settling down on your pack.

4001
04:28:49,309 --> 04:28:51,790
You can imagine the celebration going on above ground.

4002
04:28:51,790 --> 04:28:54,649
The tears and grateful reunion.

4003
04:28:54,649 --> 04:28:57,899
No surprise if they lose track of you down here in the dark.

4004
04:28:57,899 --> 04:29:02,829
And then, sure enough, the basket and the rope tumble down.

4005
04:29:02,829 --> 04:29:06,059
You clamor quickly in and they haul you up.

4006
04:29:06,059 --> 04:29:09,579
Above ground, the chief himself helps you out onto the grass.

4007
04:29:09,579 --> 04:29:12,510
His daughter is with him, clutching his hand.

4008
04:29:12,510 --> 04:29:16,200
My daughter tells you fought bravely.

4009
04:29:16,200 --> 04:29:18,360
For that, I grateful.

4010
04:29:18,360 --> 04:29:20,190
I invite you with us.

4011
04:29:20,190 --> 04:29:22,430
Back, Torrapani.

4012
04:29:22,430 --> 04:29:25,479
Will you come?

4013
04:29:25,479 --> 04:29:28,120
Carry on to Carr or back to Torrapani?

4014
04:29:28,120 --> 04:29:32,399
Go back and kill them.

4015
04:29:32,399 --> 04:29:36,860
After all the shit you did.

4016
04:29:42,670 --> 04:29:44,540
Back to town.

4017
04:29:44,540 --> 04:29:46,379
Go back, back, back, back, back.

4018
04:29:46,379 --> 04:29:47,020
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4019
04:29:47,020 --> 04:29:53,180
I'll go back, I'll go back, I'll go back, I'll go back.

4020
04:29:53,180 --> 04:29:54,940
A little generosity cannot hurt you.

4021
04:29:54,940 --> 04:29:56,139
You nod, I will come.

4022
04:29:56,139 --> 04:29:59,469
As you enter the village, it erupts into celebration.

4023
04:29:59,469 --> 04:30:04,940
You're given a place to stay and recuperate from your long journey.

4024
04:30:04,940 --> 04:30:07,899
A visit to the healing priest treats your wounds.

4025
04:30:07,899 --> 04:30:10,829
And when you emerge, it is to find the village.

4026
04:30:10,829 --> 04:30:14,639
Before so somber and silent, now in full life.

4027
04:30:14,639 --> 04:30:19,200
Flowers are tied to every rooftop and bands of sphyns are playing music on long, strangely

4028
04:30:19,200 --> 04:30:21,120
shaped lyres.

4029
04:30:21,120 --> 04:30:25,680
You are whisked away into the dance by Proceus's daughter before the chief can give you his

4030
04:30:25,680 --> 04:30:26,559
thanks again.

4031
04:30:26,559 --> 04:30:32,889
The night is glorious.

4032
04:30:32,889 --> 04:30:36,170
That night you sleep heavily and rise the next morning to continue your journey.

4033
04:30:36,170 --> 04:30:38,829
The chief meets you before you go.

4034
04:30:38,829 --> 04:30:43,920
You are rude, he declares, but we sphyns pay our debts.

4035
04:30:43,920 --> 04:30:47,000
He presses two gifts into your hands.

4036
04:30:47,639 --> 04:30:49,399
A pouch of ten gold pieces.

4037
04:30:49,399 --> 04:30:52,299
A fortune for a place like this.

4038
04:30:52,299 --> 04:30:53,920
And a key.

4039
04:30:53,920 --> 04:30:57,309
This opened the south city gate of Carr.

4040
04:30:57,309 --> 04:30:58,670
I hope it use.

4041
04:30:58,670 --> 04:31:03,129
I hope it is use.

4042
04:31:03,129 --> 04:31:04,889
Time to go.

4043
04:31:04,889 --> 04:31:05,770
You take your leave.

4044
04:31:05,770 --> 04:31:07,850
The path winds away from Torrapani.

4045
04:31:07,850 --> 04:31:13,530
And soon you are on a downward slope away from the Schumatanti Hills through stepped

4046
04:31:13,530 --> 04:31:14,940
rice fields.

4047
04:31:14,940 --> 04:31:21,079
As you walk, you feel for the first time the loneliness of the path ahead.

4048
04:31:21,079 --> 04:31:24,379
Though Carr is a busy city, it is cruel.

4049
04:31:24,379 --> 04:31:27,180
And beyond Carr, there is nothing but the vicious wasteland.

4050
04:31:27,180 --> 04:31:33,319
You'll have no time and no one to trust in the days ahead.

4051
04:31:33,319 --> 04:31:34,440
Wait, what?

4052
04:31:34,440 --> 04:31:39,469
For a brief moment up on the hills above the path you fancy, you see a figure stealing

4053
04:31:39,469 --> 04:31:42,110
its way along by some high and secret route.

4054
04:31:42,110 --> 04:31:44,270
A figure in all black.

4055
04:31:44,270 --> 04:31:49,659
But when you shade your eyes against the sun, whatever was there has disappeared.

4056
04:31:49,659 --> 04:31:51,819
In the distance rises the wall of a great city.

4057
04:31:51,819 --> 04:32:15,000
The first true stonework you have seen since you left home.

4058
04:32:15,000 --> 04:32:18,620
Your journey through the Schumatanti Hills is completed.

4059
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:23,200
Along the way you have gained the friendship of Vic, an influential man in the city.

4060
04:32:23,200 --> 04:32:25,149
And flanker the assassin.

4061
04:32:25,149 --> 04:32:27,709
And have been given the key to the gates of Carr.

4062
04:32:27,709 --> 04:32:30,590
You've collected a fantastic number of magical artifacts.

4063
04:32:30,590 --> 04:32:32,409
A large lump of beeswax.

4064
04:32:32,409 --> 04:32:33,450
A cloth skullcap.

4065
04:32:33,450 --> 04:32:34,409
One giant's tooth.

4066
04:32:34,409 --> 04:32:35,770
Twelve goblins' teeth.

4067
04:32:35,770 --> 04:32:37,950
And a bamboo pipe.

4068
04:32:37,950 --> 04:32:41,229
You are still armed only with your original sword.

4069
04:32:41,229 --> 04:32:44,860
And have no rations and seventeen pieces of gold.

4070
04:32:44,860 --> 04:32:47,120
And dispelled book.

4071
04:32:47,120 --> 04:32:50,329
The adventure continues in Sorcery 2.

4072
04:32:50,329 --> 04:32:51,709
Ah.

4073
04:32:51,709 --> 04:32:54,270
City port of traps.

4074
04:32:54,270 --> 04:32:54,670
Now.

4075
04:32:54,670 --> 04:32:58,110
It's Carray.

4076
04:32:58,110 --> 04:32:59,229
Ah-ha.

4077
04:32:59,229 --> 04:33:03,280
Ah-ha.

4078
04:33:03,280 --> 04:33:05,040
Don't save Giga Chad.

4079
04:33:05,040 --> 04:33:05,979
What?

4080
04:33:05,979 --> 04:33:07,180
Why would I not do that?

4081
04:33:07,180 --> 04:33:10,560
But yeah, I want to show you something.

4082
04:33:10,560 --> 04:33:11,360
I want to show you something.

4083
04:33:11,360 --> 04:33:12,479
It's out now, yeah.

4084
04:33:12,479 --> 04:33:14,720
I would like to show you guys something, first of all.

4085
04:33:14,720 --> 04:33:15,680
But hold on, wait.

4086
04:33:15,680 --> 04:33:17,900
Oh shit, I didn't want to do that.

4087
04:33:17,900 --> 04:33:24,139
Okay, there we go.

4088
04:33:24,139 --> 04:33:25,580
This is actually kind of interesting.

4089
04:33:25,580 --> 04:33:27,319
Because this...

4090
04:33:28,889 --> 04:33:29,689
Oh, whoops.

4091
04:33:29,689 --> 04:33:37,790
I need to take a screenshot of this.

4092
04:33:37,790 --> 04:33:38,669
This is...

4093
04:33:38,669 --> 04:33:40,060
Oops.

4094
04:33:40,060 --> 04:33:47,369
I have like a save spell.

4095
04:33:49,790 --> 04:33:51,069
How come it's not showing on the screen?

4096
04:33:51,069 --> 04:33:52,200
Well, I'm going to print screen.

4097
04:33:57,040 --> 04:33:58,189
That was...

4098
04:33:58,189 --> 04:33:58,909
Okay, wait, why...

4099
04:33:58,909 --> 04:33:59,470
Wait, wait, wait.

4100
04:33:59,470 --> 04:34:00,029
Oh, there we go.

4101
04:34:00,029 --> 04:34:01,639
What the fuck?

4102
04:34:01,639 --> 04:34:04,909
Oh, that was weird.

4103
04:34:04,909 --> 04:34:10,569
The crown of kings has been stolen by the archmage

4104
04:34:10,569 --> 04:34:12,650
and taken across the backlands to Manpeng.

4105
04:34:14,380 --> 04:34:15,979
You've been sent to get it back.

4106
04:34:15,979 --> 04:34:18,119
But you fail.

4107
04:34:18,119 --> 04:34:20,360
The whole of Kakabad will surely fall.

4108
04:34:20,360 --> 04:34:25,310
You didn't save, did you?

4109
04:34:25,310 --> 04:34:26,110
Journey began.

4110
04:34:30,250 --> 04:34:31,740
Because I alt-tabbed.

4111
04:34:31,740 --> 04:34:33,580
From the outpost settlement in Analand,

4112
04:34:33,580 --> 04:34:36,000
you crossed the Shuman Tanti Hills.

4113
04:34:36,000 --> 04:34:38,959
Along the way, you spared the life of a defeated assassin,

4114
04:34:38,959 --> 04:34:40,799
saved a village from the plague,

4115
04:34:40,799 --> 04:34:44,250
fought and killed the dreaded manticore.

4116
04:34:44,250 --> 04:34:46,810
You faced starvation and disease,

4117
04:34:46,810 --> 04:34:51,450
a test of character.

4118
04:34:51,450 --> 04:34:54,169
To survive, you used your blade rarely

4119
04:34:54,169 --> 04:34:56,509
and your intelligence frequently.

4120
04:34:56,509 --> 04:34:59,840
You deceived, charmed, and tricked your way through.

4121
04:34:59,840 --> 04:35:02,639
The spirit guide changed as you changed,

4122
04:35:02,639 --> 04:35:04,060
becoming the ape.

4123
04:35:05,360 --> 04:35:08,159
Now all of that seems a distant memory,

4124
04:35:08,159 --> 04:35:10,240
but you're approaching Kare,

4125
04:35:10,880 --> 04:35:12,319
the city-bottom trash.

4126
04:35:14,509 --> 04:35:16,990
And look at how huge this fucking map is.

4127
04:35:17,799 --> 04:35:21,000
Pounded on a ford of the Jabaji River.

4128
04:35:22,490 --> 04:35:24,409
Kare was once a camp for the pirates

4129
04:35:24,409 --> 04:35:27,689
who ambushed merchants sailing from Lake Lumli to the sea.

4130
04:35:28,250 --> 04:35:29,930
But the camp grew.

4131
04:35:30,650 --> 04:35:31,610
It became a village.

4132
04:35:32,250 --> 04:35:33,930
The village became a town,

4133
04:35:33,930 --> 04:35:38,080
and now Kare is a magnet for ne'er-do-wells and thieves

4134
04:35:38,080 --> 04:35:41,389
ruled over by a council of villains.

4135
04:35:41,389 --> 04:35:43,720
It cannot be avoided.

4136
04:35:43,720 --> 04:35:45,400
Let the city do its worst.

4137
04:35:45,400 --> 04:35:51,259
It is a place of treachery and traps.

4138
04:35:51,259 --> 04:35:55,419
You will have to be constantly on your guard.

4139
04:35:55,419 --> 04:35:58,619
As you cross, your goal is the North Gate,

4140
04:35:58,619 --> 04:36:00,939
the only entrance to the backlands

4141
04:36:00,939 --> 04:36:03,709
and the next stage of your journey.

4142
04:36:03,709 --> 04:36:04,909
Your quest is to succeed.

4143
04:36:04,909 --> 04:36:06,509
You must enter the city port of traps

4144
04:36:06,509 --> 04:36:08,029
and make it out alive.

4145
04:36:11,229 --> 04:36:17,630
Ladies and gentlemen, Inkle presents

4146
04:36:17,630 --> 04:36:24,779
Steve Jackson's slaughtering.

4147
04:36:24,779 --> 04:36:28,060
Our to Kare, the city port of traps.

4148
04:36:28,060 --> 04:36:50,409
This map is fucking huge.

4149
04:36:50,409 --> 04:36:54,360
There's a ton to do in part two.

4150
04:36:54,360 --> 04:36:57,080
Kare also, I want to make this also clear,

4151
04:36:57,080 --> 04:37:05,680
Kare is the best part of the four parts by a long shot.

4152
04:37:05,680 --> 04:37:30,169
So, ladies and gentlemen, I'll see you tomorrow.

4153
04:37:30,169 --> 04:37:37,150
That's a good place, I think, to stop.

4154
04:37:37,150 --> 04:37:43,209
But we'll pick it up tomorrow.

4155
04:37:43,209 --> 04:37:43,930
You asshole.

4156
04:37:49,259 --> 04:37:50,860
On a cliffhanger, yeah.

4157
04:37:50,860 --> 04:37:56,599
So you, hey, you should better show up tomorrow.

4158
04:37:56,599 --> 04:37:59,560
Tomorrow will not be a four and a half hour stream.

4159
04:37:59,560 --> 04:38:01,319
Tomorrow will probably be about six to seven.

4160
04:38:01,319 --> 04:38:09,599
Tomorrow, is that, oh yeah.

4161
04:38:09,599 --> 04:38:13,240
This is a, I wanted to give you guys a taste.

4162
04:38:13,240 --> 04:38:15,479
Out of curiosity, I'm very curious, I'm wondering.

4163
04:38:15,479 --> 04:38:16,520
I know this was a little shorter,

4164
04:38:16,520 --> 04:38:18,040
but I knew I was gonna get through that first one

4165
04:38:18,040 --> 04:38:20,750
and I wanted to do the next one tomorrow.

4166
04:38:20,750 --> 04:38:21,869
So here's the plan.

4167
04:38:21,869 --> 04:38:24,040
Tomorrow, we're gonna do Kare.

4168
04:38:24,040 --> 04:38:25,479
I imagine we'll get probably

4169
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:28,119
maybe halfway through Kare tomorrow.

4170
04:38:28,119 --> 04:38:32,569
And trust me when I say, there's so much,

4171
04:38:32,569 --> 04:38:35,080
there's so many things to do here

4172
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:37,479
that it's gonna take probably two or three streams.

4173
04:38:39,900 --> 04:38:41,900
That's your introduction to Sorcery.

4174
04:38:41,900 --> 04:38:48,119
Is the game worth getting one million percent?

4175
04:38:48,119 --> 04:38:51,200
Yeah, this is one of my favorite games of all time.

4176
04:38:51,200 --> 04:38:51,759
You didn't save?

4177
04:38:51,759 --> 04:38:52,240
Yes, I did.

4178
04:38:56,490 --> 04:39:00,090
So today, part one, tomorrow, we'll start part two.

4179
04:39:00,650 --> 04:39:03,849
The next day, Sunday, green screen movie night.

4180
04:39:03,849 --> 04:39:08,029
We're gonna have three streams in a row here.

4181
04:39:08,029 --> 04:39:09,630
But yeah, I'm gonna put you on a cliffhanger here

4182
04:39:09,630 --> 04:39:11,470
because yeah, let's see you tomorrow.

4183
04:39:11,470 --> 04:39:12,349
We'll show up tomorrow.

4184
04:39:13,069 --> 04:39:16,110
Plus it gives me an opportunity to rest, I mean,

4185
04:39:16,110 --> 04:39:17,549
talking and doing voices and stuff

4186
04:39:17,549 --> 04:39:21,310
for like four or five hours is, especially with being sick.

4187
04:39:21,310 --> 04:39:22,830
I kind of want to, I don't want to overdo it too much.

4188
04:39:23,470 --> 04:39:31,020
So we'll start tomorrow, probably around the same time.

4189
04:39:31,020 --> 04:39:40,330
So we're around like one, two, one p.m.

4190
04:39:42,189 --> 04:39:44,909
And then it's green screen movie night on Sunday.

4191
04:39:44,909 --> 04:39:46,860
Hope you had a good time.

4192
04:39:46,860 --> 04:39:50,720
I know this is not a very fast paced thing,

4193
04:39:52,000 --> 04:39:54,000
but I do genuinely find this to be,

4194
04:39:54,000 --> 04:39:56,720
it's one of my favorite experiences ever in all media.

4195
04:39:57,360 --> 04:40:01,040
It's just so whimsical and so interesting, especially here.

4196
04:40:01,040 --> 04:40:03,200
That part one is literally a tutorial.

4197
04:40:03,200 --> 04:40:07,340
But we'll see how people like tomorrow.

4198
04:40:07,340 --> 04:40:10,380
Hopefully the internet is, I can actually connect to the server

4199
04:40:10,380 --> 04:40:13,770
and it's not gonna be a pain in the ass tomorrow.

4200
04:40:13,770 --> 04:40:15,209
Yeah, hope you guys liked it.

4201
04:40:17,450 --> 04:40:19,130
I love this, so we'll see you tomorrow.

4202
04:40:19,770 --> 04:40:21,799
1 p.m. Pacific.

4203
04:40:21,799 --> 04:40:24,200
Yeah, Swindle Stones is literally coming up

4204
04:40:24,200 --> 04:40:26,360
in the first like 40 minutes of the stream tomorrow.

4205
04:40:26,360 --> 04:40:35,360
Try a non-West Coast server.

4206
04:40:35,360 --> 04:40:38,560
Yeah, maybe I'll try to connect to like a central

4207
04:40:38,560 --> 04:40:41,709
or like an East Coast, but we'll see you tomorrow.

4208
04:40:41,709 --> 04:40:43,069
Thanks for watching, guys.

4209
04:40:43,069 --> 04:40:45,310
Shorter, I know, but I think it's a good place to stop.

4210
04:40:45,310 --> 04:40:46,029
Makes sense.

4211
04:40:46,029 --> 04:40:52,779
Take care of yourselves.

4212
04:40:53,340 --> 04:40:56,189
Good night, goodbye.

4213
04:40:56,189 --> 04:40:57,500
See you tomorrow.

4214
04:40:57,500 --> 04:41:06,400
It's always a pleasure.

4215
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:08,639
I'm, we got exciting things back to back here.

4216
04:41:08,639 --> 04:41:12,840
I'm so ready for the green screen night.

4217
04:41:12,840 --> 04:41:15,630
I've been told that there are a lot

4218
04:41:15,630 --> 04:41:19,479
of really good submissions so far, hundreds of them.

4219
04:41:19,479 --> 04:41:21,000
So this is gonna be interesting.

4220
04:41:21,000 --> 04:41:37,580
Is it actually gonna be ready for Sunday?

4221
04:41:37,580 --> 04:41:39,020
It should be.

4222
04:41:39,020 --> 04:41:42,479
I'll check back in with everybody.

4223
04:41:42,479 --> 04:41:44,880
Tomorrow I'll give you an answer, but it should be okay.

4224
04:41:44,880 --> 04:41:46,680
I'll give you a time tomorrow.

4225
04:41:46,680 --> 04:41:48,040
It'll probably be Sunday night.

4226
04:41:48,040 --> 04:41:49,799
I feel like Sunday night's a good place for it.

4227
04:41:49,799 --> 04:41:54,029
And look, if it's not ready, then it can move in a day or two.

4228
04:41:54,029 --> 04:41:54,590
That's fine.

4229
04:41:54,590 --> 04:41:57,790
Will there be an encore?

4230
04:41:57,790 --> 04:41:59,229
Probably, likely, yes.

4231
04:41:59,229 --> 04:42:03,150
Did I change my mic settings?

4232
04:42:03,150 --> 04:42:05,639
It cuts out again when I get loud.

4233
04:42:05,639 --> 04:42:08,009
I did, I did.

4234
04:42:08,009 --> 04:42:12,810
I feel like it, even with it cutting out,

4235
04:42:12,810 --> 04:42:15,290
I feel like it's better overall.

4236
04:42:15,290 --> 04:42:17,930
But I need to find out why that's happening.

4237
04:42:17,930 --> 04:42:20,490
Your mic is weird again, yeah.

4238
04:42:20,490 --> 04:42:22,490
It's better than it was two days ago, though.

4239
04:42:22,490 --> 04:42:24,939
If I was gonna be getting loud, loud,

4240
04:42:24,939 --> 04:42:35,869
which I don't understand why the compressor keeps doing that.

4241
04:42:35,869 --> 04:42:37,790
I've used a compressor for like 12 years.

4242
04:42:37,790 --> 04:42:50,009
This guy is always loud.

4243
04:42:50,090 --> 04:42:58,029
Should've just used your first stream mic, oh god.

4244
04:42:58,029 --> 04:43:04,400
Quit stalling and leave.

4245
04:43:05,279 --> 04:43:05,919
Come on, dude.

4246
04:43:05,919 --> 04:43:08,520
I'm just hanging out.

4247
04:43:08,520 --> 04:43:13,560
I might change to the other setup if I can't figure it out by tomorrow.

4248
04:43:13,560 --> 04:43:17,740
Because I don't want my mic to be a piece of shit, you know what I mean?

4249
04:43:17,740 --> 04:43:21,040
Oh, that's a cool poll.

4250
04:43:21,040 --> 04:43:27,080
Was this your first time seeing Sorcery?

4251
04:43:27,080 --> 04:43:34,169
Please, please, guys, if you have an iPad or whatever,

4252
04:43:34,169 --> 04:43:38,889
wherever you can get comfortable, like really comfy and just relax and shit.

4253
04:43:38,970 --> 04:43:44,349
Man, getting into Kare for that first time is...

4254
04:43:44,349 --> 04:43:45,630
You just get comfortable.

4255
04:43:45,630 --> 04:43:51,639
Just sit there with like a cup of tea or something.

4256
04:43:51,639 --> 04:43:52,919
Just relax.

4257
04:43:52,919 --> 04:43:55,479
Take a shit, you know what I mean?

4258
04:43:55,479 --> 04:43:57,819
Just take a shit and play for like an hour.

4259
04:43:57,819 --> 04:43:59,419
It's amazing.

4260
04:43:59,419 --> 04:44:08,009
This is my favorite road trip game.

4261
04:44:08,009 --> 04:44:09,290
Oh, that's so cool.

4262
04:44:09,290 --> 04:44:10,799
Or like an airplane.

4263
04:44:10,799 --> 04:44:13,599
If you plan on taking a long trip,

4264
04:44:13,599 --> 04:44:17,549
Kare will take you probably 10 to 12 hours to get through, at least.

4265
04:44:17,549 --> 04:44:22,880
And remember, there's like a dozen different routes you can take in these games.

4266
04:44:23,360 --> 04:44:24,639
You're going to miss everything.

4267
04:44:24,639 --> 04:44:26,639
So you're going to have to play through it like fucking 10 times.

4268
04:44:26,639 --> 04:44:31,930
I hope you enjoyed it.

4269
04:44:31,930 --> 04:44:34,220
It's the first thing I ever did really on stream.

4270
04:44:34,220 --> 04:44:41,790
When we get to the end of Kare, we'll do another poll to see how people are liking it.

4271
04:44:41,790 --> 04:44:45,630
If people want to continue, if we want to go to part three, which is really crazy.

4272
04:44:45,630 --> 04:44:52,750
Part three dials up the...

4273
04:44:53,470 --> 04:44:55,069
Well, I don't want to say anything.

4274
04:44:55,069 --> 04:44:58,430
Part three is wild.

4275
04:44:58,430 --> 04:44:59,790
I think part two is the best.

4276
04:44:59,790 --> 04:45:02,669
Part three is probably a close second best.

4277
04:45:02,669 --> 04:45:07,130
And then part four is a mess, but not in a bad way.

4278
04:45:07,130 --> 04:45:08,090
It's just crazy.

4279
04:45:08,090 --> 04:45:09,290
The whole game is crazy.

4280
04:45:09,290 --> 04:45:12,590
But good night, guys.

4281
04:45:12,590 --> 04:45:14,119
Thank you so much.

4282
04:45:14,119 --> 04:45:15,000
We'll see you tomorrow.

4283
04:45:15,000 --> 04:46:06,080
Take care of yourselves.
